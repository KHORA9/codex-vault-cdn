It is a\r\nlabyrinth of wheels within wheels, and it is understood only by the\r\nmanagers.\" Wolcott referred to the early decades of the last century,\r\nwhen Clintonian and Bucktail, gradually absorbing the Federalists,\r\nsevered the old Republican party into warring factions. In later\r\nyears, Daniel S. Dickinson spoke of \"the tangled web of New York\r\npolitics\"; and Horace Greeley complained of \"the zigzag, wavering\r\nlines and uncouth political designations which puzzled and wearied\r\nreaders\" from 1840 to 1860, when Democrats divided into Conservatives\r\nand Radicals, Hunkers and Barnburners, and Hards and Softs; and when\r\nWhigs were known as Conscience and Cotton, and Woollies and Silver\r\nGrays. More recently James Parton, in his _Life of Andrew Jackson_,\r\nspeaks of \"that most unfathomable of subjects, the politics of the\r\nState of New York.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no attempt in this history to catalogue the prominent public\r\nmen of New York State. Such a list would itself fill a volume. It has\r\nonly been possible, in the limited space given to over a century, to\r\nlinger here and there in the company of the famous figures who rose\r\nconspicuously above their fellow men and asserted themselves\r\nmasterfully in influencing public thought and action. Indeed, the\r\nhistory of a State or nation is largely the history of a few leading\r\nmen, and it is of such men only, with some of their more prominent\r\ncontemporaries, that the author has attempted to write.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find in any Commonwealth of the Union a more\r\ninteresting or picturesque leadership than is presented in the\r\npolitical history of the Empire State. Rarely more than two\r\ncontrolling spirits appear at a time, and as these pass into apogee\r\nyounger men of approved capacity are ready to take their places. None\r\nhad a meteoric rise, but in his day each became an absolute party\r\nboss; for the Constitution of 1777, by creating the Council of\r\nAppointment, opened wide the door to bossism. The abolition of the\r\nCouncil in 1821 doubtless made individual control more difficult, but\r\nthe system left its methods so deeply impressed upon party management\r\nthat what before was done under the sanction of law, ever after\r\ncontinued under the cover of custom.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution, George Clinton and Alexander Hamilton led the\r\nopposing political forces, and while Aaron Burr was forging to the\r\nfront, the great genius of DeWitt Clinton, the nephew of George\r\nClinton, began asserting itself. The defeat of Burr for governor, and\r\nthe death of Hamilton would have left DeWitt Clinton in complete\r\ncontrol, had he found a strong man for governor whom he could use. In\r\n1812 Martin Van Buren discovered superiority as a manager, and for\r\nnearly two decades, until the death of the distinguished canal\r\nbuilder, his great ability was taxed to its uttermost in the memorable\r\ncontests between Bucktails and Clintonians. Thurlow Weed succeeded\r\nDeWitt Clinton in marshalling the forces opposed to Van Buren, whose\r\nmantle gradually fell upon Horatio Seymour. Clustered about each of\r\nthese leaders, save DeWitt Clinton, was a coterie of distinguished men\r\nwhose power of intellect has made their names familiar in American\r\nhistory. If DeWitt Clinton was without their aid, it was because\r\nstrong men in high position rebelled against becoming errand boys to\r\ndo his bidding. But the builder of the Erie canal needed no\r\nlieutenants, since his great achievement, aiding the farmer and\r\nenriching the merchant, overcame the power of Van Buren, the\r\npopularity of Tompkins, and the phenomenal ability of the Albany\r\nRegency.\r\n\r\nIn treating the period from 1800 to 1830, the term \"Democrat\" is\r\npurposely avoided, since all anti-federalist factions in New York\r\nclaimed to be \"Republican.\" The Clay electors, in the campaign of\r\n1824, adopted the title \"Democrat Ticket,\" but in 1828, and for\r\nseveral years after the formation of the Whig party in 1834, the\r\nfollowers of Jackson, repudiating the title of Democrats, called\r\nthemselves Republicans.\r\n\r\nFor aid in supplying material for character and personal sketches, the\r\nauthor is indebted to many \"old citizens\" whom he met during the years\r\nhe held the office of United States Attorney for the Northern District\r\nof New York, when that district included the entire State north and\r\nwest of Albany. He takes this occasion, also, to express his deep\r\nobligation to the faithful and courteous officials of the Library of\r\nCongress, who, during the years he has been a member of Congress,\r\nassisted him in searching for letters and other unindexed bits of New\r\nYork history which might throw some light upon subjects under\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe author hopes to complete the work in an additional volume,\r\nbringing it down to the year 1896.\r\n\r\nD.S.A.\r\n\r\nBUFFALO, N.Y., March, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nVOL.

The\r\npatriot government of New York had not been wholly satisfactory. It\r\nnever lacked in the spirit of resistance to England's misrule, but it\r\nhad failed to justify the confident prophecies of those who had been\r\ninstrumental in its formation.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a year New York City saw with wonder the spectacle of a few\r\nfearless radicals, organised into a vigilance committee of fifty,\r\nclosing the doors of a custom-house, guarding the gates of an arsenal,\r\nembargoing vessels ladened with supplies for British troops, and\r\nremoving cannon from the Battery, while an English fleet, well\r\nofficered and manned, rode idly at anchor in New York harbour.\r\nInspiring as the spectacle was, however, it did not appreciably help\r\nmatters. On the contrary, it created so much friction among the people\r\nthat the conservative business men--resenting involuntary taxation,\r\nyet wanting, if possible with honour, reconciliation and peace with\r\nthe mother country--organised, in May, 1774, a body of their own known\r\nas the Committee of Fifty-one, which thought the time had come to\r\ninterrupt the assumed leadership of the Committee of Fifty. This\r\nusurpation by one committee of powers that had been exercised by\r\nanother, caused the liveliest indignation.\r\n\r\nThe trouble between England and America had grown out of the need for\r\na continental revenue and the lack of a continental government with\r\ntaxing power--a weakness experienced throughout the Revolution and\r\nunder the Confederation. In the absence of such a government,\r\nParliament undertook to supply the place of such a power; but the\r\nAmericans blocked the way by an appeal to the principle that had been\r\nasserted by Simon de Montford's Parliament in 1265 and admitted by\r\nEdward I. in 1301--\"No taxation without representation.\" So the Stamp\r\nAct of 1765 was repealed. The necessity for a continental revenue,\r\nnevertheless, remained, and in the effort to adopt some expedient,\r\nlike the duty on tea, Crown and Colonies became involved in bitter\r\ndisputes. The idea of independence, however, had, in May, 1774,\r\nscarcely entered the mind of the wildest New York radical. In their\r\ninstructions to delegates to the first Continental Congress, convened\r\nin September, 1774, the Colonies made no mention of it. Even in May,\r\n1775, the Sons of Liberty in Philadelphia cautioned John Adams not to\r\nuse the word, since \"it is as unpopular in all the Middle States as\r\nthe Stamp Act itself.\"[1] Washington wrote from the Congress that\r\nindependence was then not \"desired by any thinking man in America.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: E.B. Andrews, _History of the United States_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n172.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid._, p. 172.]\r\n\r\nThe differences, therefore, between the Committees of Fifty and\r\nFifty-one were merely political. One favoured agitation for the\r\npurpose of arousing resistance to the King's summary methods--the\r\nother preferred a more orderly but not less forceful way of making\r\nknown their opposition. Members of both committees were patriots in\r\nthe highest and best sense, yet each faction fancied itself the only\r\npatriotic, public spirited and independent party.\r\n\r\nIt was during these months of discord that Alexander Hamilton, then a\r\nlad of seventeen, astonished his listeners at the historic meeting \"in\r\nthe Fields,\"[3] with the cogency of his arguments and the wonderful\r\nflights of an unpremeditated eloquence while denouncing the act of\r\nParliament which closed the port of Boston. Hamilton had already been\r\na year in America attending the Elizabethtown grammar school,\r\nconducted under the patronage of William Livingston, soon to become\r\nthe famous war governor of New Jersey. This experience quickened the\r\nyoung man's insight into the vexed relations between the Colonies and\r\nthe Crown, and shattered his English predilections in favour of the\r\nlittle minds that Burke thought so ill-suited to a great empire. A\r\nvisit to Boston shortly after the \"tea party\" seems also to have had\r\nthe effect of crowding his mind with thoughts, deeply and\r\nsignificantly freighted with the sentiment of liberty, which were soon\r\nto make memorable the occasion of their first utterance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: City Hall Park.]\r\n\r\nThe remarkable parallel between Hamilton and the younger Pitt begins\r\nin this year, while both are in the schoolroom. Hamilton \"in the\r\nFields\" recalls Pitt at the bar of the House of Lords, amazing his\r\ncompanions with the ripe intelligence and rare sagacity with which he\r\nfollowed the debate, and the readiness with which he skilfully\r\nformulated answers to the stately arguments of the wigged and powdered\r\nnobles. Pitt, under the tuition of his distinguished father, was\r\nfitted for the House of Commons as boys are fitted for college at\r\nExeter and Andover, and he entered Parliament before becoming of age.\r\nHamilton's preparation had been different. At twelve years of age he\r\nwas a clerk in a counting house on the island of Nevis in the West\r\nIndies; at sixteen he entered a grammar school in New Jersey; at\r\nseventeen he became a sophomore at King's College. It is then that he\r\nspoke \"in the Fields\"--not as a sophomore, not as a precocious youth\r\nwith unripe thoughts, not as a boy orator--but as a man speaking with\r\nthe wisdom of genius.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting \"in the Fields\" patriotism proved stronger than\r\nprejudice, and in November, 1774, the Committee of Fifty-one gave\r\nplace to a Committee of Sixty, charged with carrying out\r\nrecommendations of the Continental Congress. Soon after a Committee of\r\nOne Hundred, composed of members of the Committees of Fifty and\r\nFifty-one, assumed the functions of a municipal government. Finally,\r\nin May, 1775, representatives were chosen from the several counties to\r\norganise a Provincial Congress to take the place of the long\r\nestablished legislature of the Colony, which had become so steeped in\r\ntoryism that it refused to recognise the action of any body of men who\r\nresented the tyranny of Parliament. Thus, in the brief space of\r\neighteen months, the government of the Crown had been turned into a\r\ngovernment of the people.\r\n\r\nFor several months, however, the patriots of New York had desired a\r\nmore complete state government. All admitted that the revolutionary\r\ncommittees were essentially local and temporary. Even the hottest Son\r\nof Liberty came to fear the licentiousness of the people on the one\r\nhand, and the danger from the army on the other. Nevertheless, the\r\nProvincial Congress, whose members had been trained by harsh\r\nexperience to be stubborn in defence and sturdy in defiance, declined\r\nto assume the responsibility of forming such a government as the\r\nContinental Congress recommended. That body had itself come into\r\nexistence as a revolutionary legislature after the Provincial Assembly\r\nhad refused either to approve the proceedings of the first Continental\r\nCongress, or to appoint delegates to the second; and, although it did\r\nnot hesitate to usurp temporarily the functions of the Tory Assembly,\r\nto its great credit it believed the right of creating and framing a\r\nnew civil government belonged to the people; and, accordingly, on May\r\n24, 1776, it recommended the election of new representatives who\r\nshould be specially authorised to form a government for New York.\r\n\r\nThe members of this new body were conspicuous characters in New York's\r\nhistory for the next third of a century. Among them were John Jay,\r\nGeorge Clinton, James Duane, Philip Livingston, Philip Schuyler, and\r\nRobert R. Livingston. The same men appeared in the Committee of\r\nSafety, at the birth of the state government, as witnesses of the\r\nhelplessness of the Confederation, and as backers or backbiters of the\r\nFederal Constitution. Among those associated with them were James\r\nClinton, Ezra L'Hommedieu, Marinus Willett, John Morin Scott,\r\nAlexander McDougall, John Sloss Hobart, the Yateses, Abraham, Richard\r\nand Robert; the Van Cortlandts, James, John and Philip; the Morrises,\r\nRichard, Lewis and Gouverneur, and all the Livingstons. Only two\r\nillustrious names are absent from these early patriotic lists, but\r\nalready Alexander Hamilton had won the heart of the people by his\r\nwonderful eloquence and logic, and Aaron Burr, a comely lad of\r\nnineteen, slender and graceful as a girl, with the features of his\r\nbeautiful mother and the refinement of his distinguished grandfather,\r\nhad thrown away his books to join Arnold on his way to Quebec. These\r\nmen passed into history in companies, but each left behind his own\r\ntrail of light. Where danger called, or civic duties demanded prudence\r\nand profound sagacity, this band of patriots appeared in council and\r\nin the camp, ready to answer to the roll-call of their country, and by\r\nvoice and vote set the pace which achieved independence.\r\n\r\nThe new Provincial Congress met at the courthouse in White Plains on\r\nJuly 9, 1776, and, as evidence of the change from the old institutions\r\nto the new, it adopted the name of the \"Convention of the\r\nRepresentatives of the State of New York.\" As further evidence of the\r\nnew order of things it declared that New York began its existence as a\r\nState on April 20, 1775. It also adopted as the law of the State such\r\nparts of the common and statute law of England as were in force in the\r\nColony of New York on April 19, 1775.\r\n\r\nBy this time the British forces had become so active in the vicinity\r\nof New York that the convention thought it advisable to postpone the\r\nnovel and romantic work of state-making until the threatened danger\r\nhad passed; but, before its hasty adjournment, by requesting officers\r\nof justice to issue all processes and pleadings under the authority\r\nand in the name of the State of New York, it served notice that King\r\nand Parliament were no longer recognised as the source of political\r\nauthority. This appears to have been the first official mention of the\r\nnew title of the future government.[4] When the convention reassembled\r\non the first day of the following August it appointed John Jay\r\nchairman of a committee to report the draft of a state constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Memorial History of the City of New York_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n608.]\r\n\r\nJay was then thirty-one years old, a cautious, clever lawyer whose\r\nabilities were to make a great impression upon the history of his\r\ncountry. He belonged to a family of Huguenot merchants. The Jays lived\r\nat La Rochelle until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes drove the\r\ngreat-grandfather to England, where the family continued until 1686,\r\nwhen Augustus, the grandfather, settled in New York. It was not a\r\nfamily of aristocrats; but for more than a century the Jays had ranked\r\namong the gentry of New York City, intermarrying with the Bayards, the\r\nStuyvesants, the Van Cortlandts and the Philipses. To these historic\r\nfamilies John Jay added another, taking for his wife Sarah Livingston,\r\nthe sister of Brockholst, who later adorned the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, and the daughter of William, New Jersey's coming war\r\ngovernor, already famous as a writer of poems and essays.\r\n\r\nJay's public career had begun two years before in connection with the\r\nrevolutionary Committee of Fifty-one. He did not accept office because\r\nhe loved it. He went into politics as he might have travelled on a\r\nstage-coach at the invitation of a few congenial friends, for their\r\nsake, not for his own. When he took up the work of organisation,\r\ntherefore, it was with no wish to become a leader; he simply desired\r\nto guide the spirit of resistance along orderly and forceful lines.\r\nBut soon he held the reins and had his foot on the brake. In drafting\r\na reply to resolutions from a Boston town meeting, he suggested a\r\nCongress of all the Colonies, to which should be referred the\r\ndisturbing question of non-importation. This letter was not only the\r\nfirst serious suggestion of a general Congress, placing its author\r\nintellectually at the head of the Revolutionary leaders; but the\r\nplan--which meant broader organisation, more carefully concerted\r\nmeasures, an enlistment of all the conservative elements, and one\r\nofficial head for thirteen distinct and widely separated\r\ncolonies--gradually found favour, and resulted in sending the young\r\nwriter as a delegate to the first Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nIt was in this Congress that Jay won the right to become a\r\nconstitution-maker. Of all the men of that busy and brilliant age, no\r\none advanced more steadily in the general knowledge and favour. When\r\nhe wrote the address to the people of Canada, his great ability was\r\nrecognised at once; and after he composed the appeal to Ireland and to\r\nJamaica, the famous circular letter to the Colonies, and the patriotic\r\naddress to the people of his own State, his wisdom was more frequently\r\ndrawn upon and more widely appreciated than ever; but he may be said\r\nto have leaped into national fame when he drafted the address to the\r\npeople of Great Britain. While still ignorant of its authorship,\r\nJefferson declared it \"a production of the finest pen in America.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMAKING A STATE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n1777\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was early spring in 1777 before John Jay, withdrawing to the\r\ncountry, began the work of drafting a constitution. His retirement\r\nrecalls Cowper's sigh for\r\n\r\n    \"... a lodge in some vast wilderness,\r\n    Some boundless contiguity of shade,\r\n    Where rumours of oppression and deceit,\r\n    Of unsuccessful and successful war,\r\n    Might never reach me more.\"\r\n\r\nToo much and too little credit has been given Jay for his part in the\r\nwork. One writer says he \"entered an almost unexplored field.\" On the\r\nother hand, John Adams wrote Jefferson that Jay's \"model and\r\nfoundation\" was his own letter to George Wythe of Virginia. Neither is\r\ntrue. The field was not unexplored, nor did John Adams' letter contain\r\na suggestion of anything not already in existence, except the election\r\nof a Council of Appointment, with whose consent the governor should\r\nappoint all officers. His plan of letting the people elect a governor\r\ncame later. \"We have a government to form, you know,\" wrote Jay, \"and\r\nGod knows what it will resemble. Our politicians, like some guests at\r\na feast, are perplexed and undetermined which dish to prefer;\"[5] but\r\nJay evidently preferred the old home dishes, and it is interesting to\r\nnote how easily he adapted the laws and customs of the provincial\r\ngovernment to the needs of an independent State.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: John Jay, _Correspondence and Public Papers_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n68.]\r\n\r\nThe legislative branch of the government was vested in two separate\r\nand distinct bodies, called the Assembly and the Senate. The first\r\nconsisted of seventy members to be elected each year; the second of\r\ntwenty-four members, one-fourth to be elected every four years.\r\nMembers of the Assembly were proportioned to the fourteen counties\r\naccording to the number of qualified voters. For the election of\r\nsenators, the State was divided into \"four great districts,\" the\r\neastern being allowed three members, the southern nine, the middle six\r\nand the western six. To each house was given the powers and privileges\r\nof the Provincial Assembly of the Colony of New York. In creating this\r\nLegislature, Jay introduced no new feature. The old Assembly suggested\r\nthe lower house, and the former Council or upper house of the\r\nProvince, which exercised legislative powers, made a model for the\r\nSenate.[6] In their functions and operations the two bodies were\r\nindistinguishable.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Memorial History of the City of New York_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n610.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Ibid._, Vol. 2, p. 610.]\r\n\r\nThe qualifications of those who might vote for members of the\r\nLegislature greatly restricted suffrage. Theoretically every patriot\r\nbelieved in the liberties of the people, and the first article of the\r\nConstitution declared that \"no authority shall, on any pretence\r\nwhatever, be exercised over the people of the State, but such as shall\r\nbe derived from and granted by them.\" This high-sounding exordium\r\npromised the rights of popular sovereignty; but in practice the makers\r\nof the Constitution, fearing the passions of the multitude as much as\r\nthe tyranny of kings, deemed it wise to keep power in the hands of a\r\nfew. A male citizen of full age, possessing a freehold of the value of\r\ntwenty pounds, or renting a tenement of the yearly value of forty\r\nshillings, could vote for an assemblyman, and one possessing a\r\nfreehold of the value of one hundred pounds, free from all debts,\r\ncould vote for a senator.\r\n\r\nBut even these drastic conditions did not satisfy the draftsman of the\r\nConstitution. The legislators themselves, although thus carefully\r\nselected, might prove inefficient, and so, lest \"laws inconsistent\r\nwith the spirit of this Constitution, or with the public good, may be\r\nhastily or unadvisedly passed,\" a Council of Revision was created,\r\ncomposed of the governor, chancellor, and the three judges of the\r\nSupreme Court, or any two of them acting with the governor, who \"shall\r\nrevise all bills about to be passed into laws by the Legislature.\" If\r\nthe Council failed to act within ten days after having possession of\r\nthe bill, or if two-thirds of each house approved it after the Council\r\ndisapproved it, the bill became law. This Council seems to have been\r\nsuggested by the veto power possessed by the King's Privy Council.\r\n\r\nThe supreme executive power and authority of the State were vested in\r\na governor, who must be a freeholder and chosen by the ballots of\r\nfreeholders possessed of one hundred pounds above all debts. His term\r\nof office was three years, and his powers similar to those of\r\npreceding Crown governors. He was commander-in-chief of the army, and\r\nadmiral of the navy. He had power to convene the Legislature in\r\nextraordinary session; to prorogue it not to exceed sixty days in any\r\none year; and to grant pardons and reprieves to persons convicted of\r\ncrimes other than treason and murder, in which cases he might suspend\r\nsentence until the Legislature acted. In accordance with the custom of\r\nhis predecessors, he was also expected to deliver a message to the\r\nLegislature whenever it convened. To aid him in his duties, the\r\nConstitution provided for the election of a lieutenant-governor, who\r\nwas made the presiding officer of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe proposition that no authority should be exercised over the people\r\nexcept such as came from the people necessarily opened the door to an\r\nelection of the governor by the people; but how to restrict his power\r\nseems to have taxed Jay's ingenuity. He had reduced the number of\r\nvoters to its lowest terms, and put a curb on the Legislature, as well\r\nas the governor, by the creation of the Council of Revision; but how\r\nto curtail the chief executive's power in making appointments,\r\npresented a problem which gave Jay himself, when governor, good reason\r\nto regret the manner of its solution.\r\n\r\nThe only governors with whom Jay had had any experience were British\r\ngovernors, and the story of their rule was a story of astonishing\r\nmistakes and vexing stupidities. To go no farther back than Lord\r\nCornbury, the dissolute cousin of Queen Anne, not one in the long\r\nlist, covering nearly a century, exhibited gifts fitting him for the\r\ngovernment of a spirited and intelligent people, or made the slightest\r\nimpression for good either for the Crown or the Colony. Their\r\ndisposition was to be despotic, and to prevent a repetition of such\r\narbitrary conduct, Jay sought to restrict the governor's power in\r\nmaking appointments to civil office.\r\n\r\nThe new Constitution provided for the appointment of sheriffs, mayors\r\nof cities, district attorneys, coroners, county treasurers, and all\r\nother officers in the State save governor, lieutenant-governor, state\r\ntreasurer and town officers. Some members of the convention wished the\r\ngovernor to make these appointments; others wanted his power limited\r\nby the Legislature's right to confirm. Jay saw objections to both\r\nmethods. The first would give the governor too much power; the latter\r\nwould transfer too much to the Legislature. To reconcile these\r\ndifferences, therefore, he proposed \"Article XXIII. That all officers,\r\nother than those who, by this Constitution, are directed to be\r\notherwise appointed, shall be appointed in the manner following, to\r\nwit: The Assembly shall, once in every year, openly nominate and\r\nappoint one of the senators from each great district, which senators\r\nshall form a Council for the appointment of the said officers, of\r\nwhich the governor shall be president and have a casting vote, but no\r\nother vote; and with the advice and consent of the said Council shall\r\nappoint all of the said officers.\"[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: \"The clause directing the governor to _nominate_ officers\r\nto the Legislature for their approbation being read and debated, was\r\ngenerally disapproved. Many other methods were devised by different\r\nmembers, and mentioned to the house merely for consideration. I\r\nmentioned several myself, and told the convention at the time, that,\r\nhowever I might then incline to adopt them, I was not certain, but\r\nthat after considering them, I should vote for their rejection. While\r\nthe minds of the members were thus fluctuating between various\r\nopinions, I spent the evening of that day with Mr. Morris at your\r\nlodgings, in the course of which I proposed the plan for the\r\ninstitution of the Council as it now stands, and after conversing on\r\nthe subject we agreed to bring it into the house the next day. It was\r\nmoved and debated and carried.\"--John Jay, _Correspondence and Public\r\nPapers_, Vol. 1, p. 128. Letter of Jay to Robert R. Livingston and\r\nGouverneur Morris, April 29, 1777.]\r\n\r\nThis provision was simply, as the sequel showed, a bungling\r\ncompromise. Jay intended that the governor should nominate and the\r\nCouncil confirm, and in the event of a tie the governor should have\r\nthe casting vote. But in practice it subordinated the governor to the\r\nCouncil whenever a majority of the Assembly was politically opposed to\r\nhim, and the annual election of the Council greatly increased the\r\nchances of such opposition. When, finally, the Council of Appointment\r\nset up the claim that the right to nominate was vested concurrently in\r\nthe governor and in each of the four senators, it practically stripped\r\nthe chief executive of power.\r\n\r\nThe anomaly of the Constitution was the absence of provision for the\r\njudicature, the third co-ordinate branch of the government. One court\r\nwas created for the trial of impeachments and the correction of\r\nerrors, but the great courts of original jurisdiction, the Supreme\r\nCourt and the Court of Chancery, as well as the probate court, the\r\ncounty court, and the court of admiralty, were not mentioned except\r\nincidentally in sections limiting the ages of the judges, the offices\r\neach might hold, and the appointment of clerks. Instead of recreating\r\nthese courts, the Constitution simply recognised them as existing. The\r\nnew court established, known as the Court of Errors and Impeachment,\r\nconsisted of the president of the Senate, the senators, the\r\nchancellor, and the three judges of the Supreme Court, or a major part\r\nof them. The conception of vesting supreme appellate jurisdiction in\r\nthe upper legislative house was derived from the former practice of\r\nappeals to the Council of the Province,[9] which possessed judicial\r\nas well as legislative power. The Constitution further followed the\r\npractice of the old Council by providing that judges could not vote on\r\nappeals from their own judgments, although they might deliver\r\narguments in support of the same--a custom which had obtained in New\r\nYork from the earliest times.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Memorial History of the City of New York_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n612.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Duke's Laws_, Vol. 1, Chap. 14.]\r\n\r\nIn like manner provincial laws, grants of lands and charters, legal\r\ncustoms, and popular rights, most of which had been in existence for a\r\ncentury, were carried over. The Constitution simply provided, in a\r\ngeneral way, for the continuance of such parts of the common law of\r\nEngland, the statute law of England and Great Britain, and the acts of\r\nthe legislature of the Colony of New York, as did not yield obedience\r\nto the government exercised by Great Britain, or establish any\r\nparticular denomination of Christians, or their priests or ministers,\r\nwho were debarred from holding any civil or military office under the\r\nnew State; but acts of attainder for crimes committed after the close\r\nof the war were abrogated, with the declaration that such acts should\r\nnot work a corruption of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe draft of the Constitution in Jay's handwriting was reported to the\r\nconvention on March 12, 1777, and on the following day the first\r\nsection was accepted. Then the debate began. Sixty-six members\r\nconstituted the convention, a majority of whom, led by John Morin\r\nScott, believed in the reign of the people. The spirit that nerved a\r\nhandful of men to embargo vessels and seize munitions of war covered\r\nby British guns never wanted courage, and this historic band now\r\nprepared to resist a conservatism that seemed disposed simply to\r\nchange the name of their masters. Jay understood this feeling. \"It is\r\nprobable that the convention was ultra-democratic,\" says William Jay,\r\nin the biography of his father, \"for I have heard him observe that\r\nanother turn of the winch would have cracked the cord.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: William Jay, _Life of John Jay; Jay MSS._, Vol. 1, p.\r\n72.]\r\n\r\nJay was not without supporters. Conservatives like the Livingstons,\r\nthe Morrises, and the Yateses never acted with the recklessness of\r\ndespair. They had well-formed notions of a popular government, and\r\ntheir replies to proposed changes broke the force of the opposition.\r\nBut Jay, relying more upon his own policy, prudently omitted several\r\nprovisions that seemed to him important, and when discussion developed\r\ntheir need, he shrewdly introduced them as amendments. Upon one\r\nquestion, however, a prolonged and spirited debate occurred. This\r\ncentred upon the freedom of conscience. The Dutch of New Netherland,\r\nalmost alone among the Colonies, had never indulged in fanaticism, and\r\nthe Constitution, breathing the spirit of their toleration, declared\r\nthat \"the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and\r\nworship without diminution or preference shall forever hereafter be\r\nallowed within the State to all mankind.\" Jay did not dissent from\r\nthis sentiment; but, as a descendant of the persecuted Huguenots, he\r\nwished to except Roman Catholics until they should deny the Pope's\r\nauthority to absolve citizens from their allegiance and to grant\r\nspiritual absolution, and he forcefully insisted upon and secured the\r\nrestriction that \"the liberty of conscience hereby granted shall not\r\nbe so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness or justify\r\npractices inconsistent with the safety of the State.\" The question of\r\nthe naturalisation of foreigners renewed the contention. Jay's\r\nHuguenot blood was still hot, and again he exacted the limitation that\r\nall persons, before naturalisation, shall \"abjure and renounce all\r\nallegiance to all and every foreign king, prince, potentate, and\r\nstate, in all matters ecclesiastical as well as civil.\"\r\n\r\nJay intended reporting other amendments--one requiring a similar\r\nrenunciation on the part of all persons holding office, and one\r\nabolishing domestic slavery. But before the convention adjourned he\r\nwas, unfortunately, summoned to the bedside of his dying mother.\r\nOtherwise, New York would probably have had the distinction of being\r\nfirst to set the example of freedom. \"I should have been for a clause\r\nagainst the continuance of domestic slavery,\" he said, in a letter\r\nobjecting to what occurred after his forced retirement.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: John Jay, _Correspondence and Public Papers_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n126. \"Such a recommendation was introduced by Gouverneur Morris and\r\npassed, but subsequently omitted.\"--_Ibid._, p. 136, _note_.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Constitution was under consideration for more than a\r\nmonth, haste characterised the close of the convention's\r\ndeliberations. As soon as Jay left, every one seemed eager to get\r\naway, and on Sunday, April 20, 1777, the Constitution was adopted as a\r\nwhole practically as he left it, and a committee appointed to report a\r\nplan for establishing a government under it. Unlike the Constitution\r\nof Massachusetts, it was not submitted to the voters for ratification.\r\nThe fact that the delegates themselves had been elected by the people\r\nseemed sufficient, and two days after its passage, the secretary of\r\nthe convention, standing upon a barrel in front of the courthouse at\r\nKingston, published it to the world by reading it aloud to those who\r\nhappened to be present. As it became known to the country, it was\r\ncordially approved as the most excellent and liberal of the American\r\nconstitutions. \"It is approved even in New England,\" wrote Jay, \"where\r\nfew New York productions have credit.\"[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Ibid._, p. 140.]\r\n\r\nThe absence of violent democratic innovations was the Constitution's\r\nremarkable feature. Although a product of the Revolution, framed to\r\nmeet the necessities growing out of that great event, its general\r\nprovisions were decidedly conservative. The right of suffrage was so\r\nrestricted that as late as 1790 only 1303 of the 13,330 male residents\r\nof New York City possessed sufficient property to entitle them to vote\r\nfor governor. Even the Court of Chancery remained undisturbed,\r\nnotwithstanding royal governors had created it in opposition to the\r\nwishes of the popular assembly. But despite popular dissatisfaction,\r\nwhich evidenced itself in earnest prayers and ugly protests, the\r\ninstrument, so rudely and hastily published on April 22, 1777,\r\nremained the supreme law of the State for forty-four years.\r\n\r\nBefore adjournment the convention, adopting the report of its\r\ncommittee for the organisation of a state government, appointed Robert\r\nR. Livingston, chancellor; John Jay, chief justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt; Robert Yates, Jr., and John Sloss Hobart, justices of the\r\nSupreme Court, and Egbert Benson, attorney-general. To a Council of\r\nSafety, composed of fifteen delegates, with John Morin Scott,\r\nchairman, were confided all the powers of the State until superseded\r\nby a regularly elected governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGEORGE CLINTON ELECTED GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n1777\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the constitutional convention adjourned in May, 1777, the\r\nCouncil of Safety immediately ordered the election of a governor,\r\nlieutenant-governor, and members of the Legislature. The selection of\r\na governor by ballot interested the people. Although freeholders who\r\ncould vote represented only a small part of the male population,\r\npatriots of every class rejoiced in the substitution of a neighbour\r\nfor a lord across the sea. And all had a decided choice. Of those\r\nsuggested as fittest as well as most experienced Philip Schuyler, John\r\nMorin Scott, John Jay and George Clinton were the favourites. Just\r\nthen Schuyler was in the northern part of the province, watching\r\nBurgoyne and making provision to meet the invasion of the Mohawk\r\nValley; George Clinton, in command on the Hudson, was equally watchful\r\nof the movements of Sir Henry Clinton, whose junction with Burgoyne\r\nmeant the destruction of Forts Clinton and Montgomery at the lower\r\nentrance to the Highlands; while Scott and Jay, as members of the\r\nCouncil of Safety, were directing the government of the new State.\r\n\r\nSchuyler's public career began in the Provincial Assembly of New York\r\nin 1768. He represented the people's interests with great boldness,\r\nand when the Assembly refused to thank the delegates of the first\r\nContinental Congress, or to appoint others to a second Congress, he\r\naided in the organisation of the Provincial Congress which usurped the\r\nAssembly's functions and put all power into the hands of the people.\r\nChancellor Kent thought that \"in acuteness of intellect, profound\r\nthought, indefatigable activity, exhaustless energy, pure patriotism,\r\nand persevering and intrepid public efforts, Schuyler had no\r\nsuperior;\" and Daniel Webster declared him \"second only to Washington\r\nin the services he rendered the country.\"[14] But there was in\r\nSchuyler's make-up a touch of arrogance that displayed itself in\r\nletters as well as in manners. The soldierly qualities that made him a\r\ncommander did not qualify him for public place dependent upon the\r\nsuffrage of men. People respected but did not love him. If they were\r\nindignant that Gates succeeded him, they did not want him to govern\r\nthem, however much it may have been in his heart to serve them\r\nfaithfully.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: While in command of the northern department, embracing\r\nthe province of New York, Schuyler was known as \"Great Eye,\" so\r\nwatchful did he become of the enemy's movements; and although\r\nsubsequently, through slander and intrigue, superseded by Horatio\r\nGates, history has credited Burgoyne's surrender largely to his wisdom\r\nand patriotism, and has branded Gates with incompetency, in spite of\r\nthe latter's gold medal and the thanks of Congress.]\r\n\r\nJohn Morin Scott represented the radical element among the patriots.\r\nBy profession he was an able and wealthy lawyer; by occupation a\r\npatriotic agitator. John Adams, who breakfasted with him, speaks of\r\nhis country residence three miles out of town as \"an elegant seat,\r\nwith the Hudson just behind the house, and a rural prospect all around\r\nhim.\" But the table seems to have made a deeper impression upon the\r\nYankee patriot than the picturesque scenery of the river. \"A more\r\nelegant breakfast I never saw--rich plate, a very large silver\r\ncoffee-pot, a very large silver teapot, napkins of the very finest\r\nmaterials, toast and bread and butter in great perfection. Afterwards\r\na plate of beautiful peaches, another of pears, another of plums, and\r\na musk melon.\" As a parting salute, this lover of good things spoke of\r\nhis host as \"a sensible man, one of the readiest speakers upon the\r\ncontinent, but not very polite.\"[15] This is what the Tories thought.\r\nAccording to Jones, the Tory historian, Scott had the misfortune to\r\ngraduate at Yale--\"a college remarkable for its republican principles\r\nand religious intolerance,\" he says, and to belong to a triumvirate\r\nwhose purpose was \"to pull down church and state, and to raise their\r\nown government upon the ruins.\"[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: John Adams, _Life and Works_, Vol. 2, p. 349 (Diary).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Thomas Jones, _History of New York_, Vol. 1, p. 3.]\r\n\r\nScott, no doubt, was sometimes mistaken in the proper course to\r\npursue, but he was always right from his point of view, and his point\r\nof view was bitter hostility to English misrule. Whatever he did he\r\ndid with all the resistless energy of a man still in his forties. He\r\nwas of distinguished ancestry. His great-great-grandfather, Sir John\r\nScott, baronet, of Ancrum, Scotland, had been a stalwart Whig before\r\nthe revolution of 1688, and his grandfather, John Scott, coming to New\r\nYork in 1702, had commanded Fort Hunter, a stronghold on the Mohawk.\r\nBoth were remarkable men. Tory blood was foreign to their veins. Young\r\nJohn, breathing the air of independence, scorned to let his life and\r\nproperty depend upon the pleasure of British lords and a British\r\nministry, or to be excluded from the right of trial by a jury of his\r\nneighbours, or of taxation by his own representatives. In 1775 he went\r\nto the Continental Congress; in 1776, to the Provincial Congress of\r\nNew York; and later he participated in the battle of Long Island as a\r\nbrigadier-general. After the adoption of the State Constitution he\r\nbecame secretary of state, and from 1780 to 1783 served in the\r\nContinental Congress. He lived long enough to see his country free,\r\nalthough his strenuous life ended at fifty-four.\r\n\r\nGeorge Clinton possessed more popular manners than either Schuyler or\r\nScott. Indeed, it has been given to few men in New York to inspire\r\nmore passionate personal attachment than George Clinton. A patriot\r\nnever lived who was more bitter in his hostility to English misrule,\r\nor more uncompromising in his opposition to toryism. He was a typical\r\nIrishman--intolerant, often domineering, sometimes petulant, and\r\noccasionally too quick to take offence, but he was magnetic and\r\ngenerous, easily putting himself in touch with those about him, and\r\nready, without hesitation, to help the poorest and carry the weakest.\r\nThis was the kind of man the people wanted for governor.\r\n\r\nClinton came of a good family. His great-grandfather, a too devoted\r\nadherent of Charles I., found it healthful to wander about Europe, and\r\nfinally to settle in the north of Ireland, out of reach of Cromwell's\r\nsoldiers, and out of sight of his ancestral patrimony. By the time\r\nCharles II. came to the throne, the estate was lost, and this friend\r\nof the Stuarts lived on in the quiet of his secluded home, and after\r\nhim, his son; but the grandson, stirred by the blood of a Puritan\r\nmother, exchanged the North Sea shore for the banks of the Hudson,\r\nwhere his son breathed the air that made him a leading spirit in the\r\nwar for American independence. Clinton's youth is one record of\r\nprecocity. Before the war began he passed through a long, a varied,\r\neven a brilliant career, climbing to the highest position in the State\r\nbefore he had reached the age when most men begin to fill responsible\r\nplaces. At fifteen he manned an American privateer; at sixteen, as a\r\nlieutenant, he accompanied his father in a successful assault upon\r\nFort Frontenac; at twenty-six, in the colonial legislature, he became\r\nthe rival of Philip Schuyler in the leadership and influence that\r\nenabled a patriotic minority to resist the aggressions of Great\r\nBritain; at thirty-six, holding a seat in the Second Continental\r\nCongress, he voted for the Declaration of Independence, and commanded\r\na brigade of Ulster County militia.\r\n\r\nThe election which occurred in June was not preceded by a campaign of\r\nspeaking. People were too busy fighting to supplement a campaign of\r\nbullets with one of words. But Jay sent out an electioneering letter\r\nrecommending Philip Schuyler for governor and George Clinton for\r\nlieutenant-governor. This was sufficient to secure for these\r\ncandidates the conservative vote. It showed, too, Jay's unconcern for\r\nhigh place. He was modest even to diffidence, an infirmity that seems\r\nto have depressed him at times as much as it did Nathaniel Hawthorne\r\nin a later day.\r\n\r\nThe returns were made to the Council of Safety, and Jay carefully\r\nscanned them as they came in. On June 20 he wrote Schuyler: \"The\r\nelections in the middle district have taken such a turn as that, if a\r\ntolerable degree of unanimity should prevail in the upper counties,\r\nthere will be little doubt of having, ere long, the honour of\r\naddressing a letter to your excellency. Clinton, being pushed for both\r\noffices, may have neither; he has many votes for the first and not a\r\nfew for the second. Scott, however, has carried a number from him, and\r\nyou are by no means without a share. You may rely on receiving by\r\nexpress the earliest notice of the event alluded to.\"[17] When the\r\nvoters from Orange and other southern counties came in, however, Jay\r\ndiscovered that the result did not follow the line either of his\r\nwishes or of his suggestions. On the contrary, Clinton was elected to\r\nboth offices by a considerable plurality.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: John Jay, _Correspondence and Public Papers_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n142.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: \"A fragment of the canvass of 1777 shows the returns\r\nfrom Albany, Cumberland, Dutchess, Tryon, and Westchester, as follows:\r\nClinton, 865; Scott, 386; Schuyler, 1012; Jay, 367; Philip Livingston,\r\n5; Robert R. Livingston, 7. The votes from Orange and other southern\r\ncounties gave the election to Clinton.\"--_Civil List, State of New\r\nYork_ (1886), p. 164. Subsequently, when the Legislature met at\r\nKingston on September 1, Pierre Van Cortlandt as president of the\r\nSenate performed the duties of lieutenant-governor.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the election proved a great surprise and something of a\r\nhumiliation to the ruling classes. \"Gen. Clinton, I am informed, has a\r\nmajority of votes for the Chair,\" Schuyler wrote to Jay, on June 30.\r\n\"If so he has played his cards better than was expected.\"[19] A few\r\ndays later, after confirmation of the rumour, he betrayed considerable\r\nfeeling. \"Clinton's family and connections do not entitle him to so\r\ndistinguished a pre-eminence,\" he wrote, showing that Revolutionary\r\nheroes were already divided into more democratic and less democratic\r\nwhigs, and more aristocratic and less aristocratic patriots; but the\r\ndivision was still in the mind rather than in any settled policy. \"He\r\nis virtuous and loves his country,\" added Schuyler, in the next line;\r\n\"he has ability and is brave, and I hope he will experience from every\r\npatriot support, countenance and comfort.\"[20] Washington understood\r\nhis merits. \"His character will make him peculiarly useful at the head\r\nof your State,\" he wrote the Committee of Safety.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: John Jay, _Correspondence and Public Papers_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n144.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: John Jay, _Correspondence and Public Papers_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n146.]\r\n\r\nClinton's inauguration occurred on July 30, 1777. He stood in front of\r\nthe courthouse at Kingston on top of the barrel from which the\r\nConstitution had been published in the preceding April, and in the\r\nuniform of his country, with sword in hand, he took the oath of\r\noffice. Within sixty days thereafter Sir Henry Clinton had carried the\r\nHighland forts, scattered the Governor's troops, dispersed the first\r\nLegislature of the State, burned Kingston to the ground, and very\r\nnearly captured the Governor himself, the latter, under cover of\r\nnight, having made his escape by crossing the river in a small\r\nrowboat. Among the captured patriots was Colonel McClaughry, the\r\nGovernor's brother-in-law. \"Where is my friend George?\" asked Sir\r\nHenry. \"Thank God,\" replied the Colonel, \"he is safe and beyond the\r\nreach of your friendship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCLINTON AND HAMILTON\r\n\r\n1777-1789\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the war Governor Clinton's duties were largely military. Every\r\nimportant measure of the Legislature dealt with the public defence,\r\nand the time of the Executive was fully employed in carrying out its\r\nenactments and performing the work of commander-in-chief of the\r\nmilitia. A large proportion of the population of the State was either\r\navowedly loyal to the Crown or secretly indisposed to the cause of\r\nindependence. \"Of all the Colonies,\" wrote William Jay, \"New York was\r\nprobably the least unanimous in the assertion and defence of the\r\nprinciples of the Revolution. The spirit of disaffection was most\r\nextensive on Long Island, and had probably tainted a large majority of\r\nits inhabitants. In Queens County, in particular, the people had, by a\r\nformal vote, refused to send representatives to the colonial congress\r\nor convention, and had declared themselves neutral in the present\r\ncrisis.\"[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 41.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor sought to crush this spirit by methods much in vogue in\r\nthe eighteenth century. At the outset of his career he declared that\r\nhe had \"rather roast in hell to all eternity than be dependent upon\r\nGreat Britain or show mercy to a damned Tory.\" To add to his fame, he\r\nenforced this judgment with heavy fines, long imprisonments, summary\r\nbanishments, and frequent coats of tar and feathers.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the adoption of the Constitution, the Legislature\r\npassed a law requiring an oath of allegiance to the State; and under\r\nthe vigorous enforcement of this act the Governor sent many Tories\r\nfrom the rural districts into the city of New York or expelled them\r\nfrom the State. Others were required to give a pledge, with security,\r\nto reside within prescribed limits. At times even the churches were\r\nfilled with prisoners, some of whom were sent to jails in Connecticut,\r\nor exchanged for prisoners of war. In 1779 the Legislature increased\r\nthe penalty of disloyalty to the State, by passing the Confiscation\r\nAct, declaring \"the forfeiture and sale of the estates of persons who\r\nhad adhered to the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nUp to this time only one political party had existed among the Whig\r\ncolonists. The passage of the Confiscation Act, however, encountered\r\nthe opposition of many sincere lovers of the cause of independence,\r\nwho favoured a more moderate policy toward loyalists, since they were\r\nprobably as sincere in their opinions as those opposed to them.\r\nBesides, a generous and magnanimous course, it was argued, would\r\ninduce the return of many desirable citizens after hostilities had\r\nceased. To this the ultra-Whigs replied that the law of\r\nself-preservation made a severe policy necessary, and if any one\r\nsuffered by its operation he must look to the government of his choice\r\nfor comfort and reimbursement. As for the return of the Tories, the\r\nultras declared that only citizens sincerely loyal to an independent\r\ncountry would be acceptable.\r\n\r\nThis division into moderate and ultra Whigs was emphasised in 1781 by\r\nthe legislative grant to Congress of such import duties as accrued at\r\nthe port of New York, to be levied and collected \"under such penalties\r\nand regulations, and by such officers, as Congress should from time to\r\ntime make, order, and appoint.\" Governor Clinton did not cordially\r\napprove the act at the time of its passage, and as the money began\r\nflowing into the national treasury, he opposed the method of its\r\nsurrender. In his opinion, the State, as an independent sovereignty,\r\nhad associated itself with other Colonies only for mutual protection,\r\nand not for their support. At his instance, therefore, the Legislature\r\nsubstituted for the law of 1781 the act of March, 1783, granting the\r\nduties to Congress, but directing their collection by officers of the\r\nState. Although this act was subsequently amended, making collectors\r\namenable to Congress, another law was enacted in 1786 granting\r\nCongress the revenue, and reserving to the State, as in the law of\r\n1783, \"the sole power of levying and collecting the duties.\" When\r\nCongress asked the Governor to call a special session of the\r\nLegislature, that the right to levy and collect might be yielded as\r\nbefore, he refused to do so.\r\n\r\nGovernor Clinton understood the commercial advantages of New York's\r\ngeographical location, which were greatly enhanced by the navigation\r\nacts of other States. The peace treaty had made New York the port of\r\nentry for the whole region east of the Delaware, and into its coffers\r\npoured a revenue so marvellous as to excite hopes of a prospective\r\nwealth which a century, remarkable as was its productiveness, did\r\nlittle more than realise. If any State, therefore, could survive\r\nwithout a union with other Colonies, it was New York, and it is not\r\nsurprising that many, perhaps a majority of its people, under the\r\nleadership of George Clinton, settled into a policy unfriendly to a\r\nnational revenue, and later to a national government.\r\n\r\nThe Governor had gradually become mindful of an opposition as stubborn\r\nas it was persistent. He had encountered it in his treatment of the\r\nTories, but not until Alexander Hamilton became an advocate of amnesty\r\nand oblivion, did Clinton recognise the centre and future leader of\r\nthe opposing forces. Hamilton did not appear among those interested in\r\nthe election of governor in 1777. His youth shut him out of Assembly\r\nand Congress, out of committees and conventions, but it did not shut\r\nhim out of the army; and while Governor Clinton was wrestling with new\r\nproblems of government in the formation of a new State, Hamilton was\r\nacting as secretary, aide, companion, and confidant of Washington,\r\naccepting suggestions as commands, and acquiescing in his chief's\r\njudgment with a fidelity born of love and admiration. In the history\r\nof war nothing is more beautiful than the friendship existing between\r\nthe acknowledged leader of his country and this brave young officer,\r\nspirited and impulsive, brilliant and able, yet frank and candid,\r\nwithout ostentation and without egotism. It recalls a later-day\r\nrelationship between Ulysses S. Grant and John A. Rawlins, his chief\r\nof staff.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1781, Hamilton, in command of a corps, accompanied Washington\r\nin the forced march of the American army from New York to Yorktown.\r\nThis afforded him the opportunity, so long and eagerly sought, of\r\nhandling an independent command at a supreme moment of danger, and\r\nbefore the sun went down on the 14th of October, he had led his troops\r\nwith fixed bayonets, under a heavy and constant fire, over abatis,\r\nditch, and palisades; then, mounting the parapet, he leaped into the\r\nredoubt. Washington saw the impetuosity of the attack in the face of\r\nthe murderous fire, the daring leap to the parapet with three of his\r\nsoldiers, and the almost fatal spring into the redoubt. \"Few cases,\"\r\nhe says, \"have exhibited greater proofs of intrepidity, coolness, and\r\nfirmness.\" Three days later Cornwallis surrendered.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1782 Hamilton was admitted to the bar in Albany, but\r\nsoon afterward settled in New York City, where he seems to have come\r\ninto practice and into fame by defending the rights of Tories. For\r\nfour years after the war ended, the treatment of British sympathisers\r\nwas the dominant political issue in New York. Governor Clinton\r\nadvocated disfranchisement and banishment, and the Legislature enacted\r\ninto law what he advised; so that when the British troops, under the\r\npeace treaty, evacuated New York, in November, 1783, loyalists who had\r\nthus far escaped the wrath of this patriot Governor, flocked to Nova\r\nScotia and New Brunswick like birds seeking a more congenial clime,\r\nrecalling the flight of the Huguenots after the revocation of the\r\nEdict of Nantes one hundred years earlier. It is not easy to estimate\r\nthe number who fled before this savage and violent action of the\r\nLegislature. Sir Guy Carleton, in command at New York, fixes the\r\nemigration at one hundred thousand souls. For many years the \"Landing\r\nof the Loyalists\" was annually commemorated at St. John, and in the\r\ncemeteries of England and Scotland are found the tombstones of these\r\nunfortunate devotees of the mother country.\r\n\r\nIt is likely Clinton was too intolerant, but it was the intolerance\r\nthat follows revolution. Hamilton, on the other hand, became an early\r\nadvocate of amnesty and oblivion, and, although public sentiment and\r\nthe Legislature were against him, he finally succeeded in modifying\r\nthe one and changing the other. \"Nothing is more common,\" he observed,\r\n\"than for a free people in times of heat and violence to gratify\r\nmomentary passions by letting in principles and precedents which\r\nafterwards prove fatal to themselves. If the Legislature can\r\ndisfranchise at pleasure, it may soon confine all the votes to a small\r\nnumber of partisans, and establish an aristocracy or an oligarchy; if\r\nit may banish at discretion, without hearing or trial, no man can be\r\nsafe. The name of liberty applied to such a government would be a\r\nmockery of common sense.\"[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 3, p. 450.]\r\n\r\nThe differences between Congress and the Legislature respecting the\r\ncollection of duties also brought Clinton and Hamilton into conflict.\r\nAs early as 1776 Hamilton had considered the question whether Congress\r\nought not to collect its own taxes by its own agents,[23] and, when a\r\nmember of Congress in 1783, he urged it[24] as one of the cardinal\r\nfeatures of an adequate federal system. In 1787 he was a member of the\r\nLegislature. Here he insisted upon having the federal revenue system\r\nadopted by the State. His argument was an extended exposition of the\r\nfacts which made such action important.[25] Under the lead of Clinton,\r\nhowever, New York was willing to surrender the money, but not the\r\npower of collection to Congress.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Republic_, Vol. 1, p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Madison Papers_, Vol. 1, pp. 288, 291, 380.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Works_, Vol. 2, p. 16.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, the pitiable condition to which the Confederation had come,\r\naccented the need of a stronger central government. To this end\r\nClinton and Hamilton seemed for several years to be working in\r\nharmony. In 1780 Clinton had presented to the Legislature the \"defect\r\nof power\" in the Confederation, and, in 1781, John Sloss Hobart and\r\nEgbert Benson, representing New York at a convention in Hartford,\r\nurged the recommendation empowering Congress to apportion taxes among\r\nthe States in the ratio of their total population. The next year,\r\nHamilton, although not a member of the Legislature, persuaded it to\r\nadopt resolutions written by him, declaring that the powers of the\r\ncentral government should be extended, and that it should be\r\nauthorised to provide revenue for itself. To this end \"it would be\r\nadvisable,\" continued the resolutions, \"to propose to Congress to\r\nrecommend, and to each State to adopt, the measure of assembling a\r\ngeneral convention of the States, specially authorised to revise and\r\namend the Constitution.\" To Washington's farewell letter, appealing\r\nfor a stronger central government, Governor Clinton sent a cordial\r\nresponse, and in transmitting the address to the Legislature in 1784,\r\nhe recommended attention \"to every measure which has a tendency to\r\ncement the Union, and to give to the national councils that energy\r\nwhich may be necessary for the general welfare.\"[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 1, p. 277.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Clinton was not always candid. His official\r\ncommunications read like the utterances of a friend; but his\r\ninfluence, as disclosed in the acts of 1783 and 1786, reserving to the\r\nState the sole power of levying and collecting duties, clearly\r\nindicate that while he loved his country in a matter-of-fact sort of\r\nway, it meant a country divided, a country of thirteen States each\r\nberating the other, a country of trade barriers and commercial\r\nresentments, a country of more importance to New York and to Clinton\r\nthan to other Commonwealths which had made equal sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThus matters drifted until New York and other middle Atlantic States\r\ndiscovered that it was impossible under the impotent Articles of\r\nConfederation to regulate commerce in waters bordered by two or more\r\nStates. Even when New York and New Jersey could agree, Pennsylvania,\r\non the other side of New Jersey, was likely to withhold its consent.\r\nFriction of a similar character existed between Maryland and Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina and Virginia, and Maryland and Pennsylvania. This\r\ncompelled Congress to call the convention, to which commissioners from\r\nNew York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia, assembled\r\nat Annapolis in 1786, to consider the trade and commerce of the United\r\nStates, and to suggest measures for the action of Congress. Hamilton\r\nand Egbert Benson were members of this body, the former of whom wrote\r\nthe address, afterward adopted, which declared the federal government\r\ninefficient, and proposed a convention to revise the Articles of\r\nConfederation,[27] in order to render them adequate to the exigencies\r\nof the Union. This was the resolution unanimously adopted by the New\r\nYork Legislature in 1782, but to the surprise of Hamilton and the\r\nfriends of a stronger government, the Legislature now disapproved such\r\na convention. The idea did not please George Clinton. As Hamilton\r\nsummed up the opposition, it meant disinclination to taxation, fear of\r\nthe enforcement of debts, democratic jealousy of important officials,\r\nand the influence of foreign powers.[28]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Journal of Congress_, Vol. 12, p. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 1, p. 401.]\r\n\r\nIn 1787, however, the Legislature adopted a joint resolution\r\ninstructing members of Congress from the State to urge that a\r\nconvention be held to amend the Articles of Confederation, and, when\r\nCongress issued the call,[29] Robert Yates, John Lansing, Jr., and\r\nAlexander Hamilton were elected delegates \"for the sole purpose of\r\nrevising the Articles of Confederation, and reporting to Congress and\r\nthe several Legislatures such alterations as shall, when agreed to by\r\nCongress and confirmed by the several States, render the Federal\r\nConstitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the\r\npreservation of the Union.\" Hamilton's election to this convention was\r\ncited as proof of Clinton's disposition to treat fairly the opponents\r\nof state supremacy, since it was well understood that his presence at\r\nPhiladelphia would add the ablest and most ultra exponent of a strong,\r\ncentral government. It was certainly in Clinton's power to defeat\r\nHamilton as he did John Jay, but his liberality carried a high\r\ncheck-rein, for Robert Yates and John Lansing were selected to\r\novercome Hamilton's vote.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: In _Madison Papers_, Vol. 2, Introductory to Debates of\r\n1787, is a history of previous steps toward union.]\r\n\r\nClinton's first choice for a delegate was Yates, whose criticism of\r\nthe work of the convention manifests hostility to a Union. He seemed\r\nto have little conception of what would satisfy the real needs of a\r\nstrong government, preferring the vague doctrines of the old Whigs in\r\nthe early days of revolution. Lansing was clearer, and, perhaps, less\r\nextreme in his views; but he wanted nothing more than an amendment of\r\nthe existing Confederation, known as the New Jersey plan.[30] The\r\nmoment, therefore, that a majority favoured the Virginia plan which\r\ncontemplated a national government with an executive, legislature,\r\nand judiciary of its own, Lansing and Yates, regarding it a violation\r\nof their instructions, and with the approval of Governor Clinton,\r\nwithdrew[31] from the convention and refused to sign the Constitution\r\nafter its adoption.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: \"After an amendment of the first, so as to declare that\r\n'the government of the United States ought to consist of a supreme\r\nlegislative, judiciary, and executive,' Lansing moved a declaration\r\n'that the powers of legislation be vested in the United States\r\nCongress.' He stated that if the Jersey plan was not adopted, it would\r\nproduce the mischiefs they were convened to obviate. That the\r\nprinciples of that system were an equality of representation, and\r\ndependence of the members of Congress on the States. That as long as\r\nstate distinctions exist, state prejudices would operate, whether the\r\nelection be by the States or the people. If there was no interest to\r\noppress, there was no need of an apportionment. What would be the\r\neffect of the other plan? Virginia would have sixteen, Delaware one\r\nrepresentative. Will the general government have leisure to examine\r\nthe state laws? Will it have the necessary information? Will the\r\nStates agree to surrender? Let us meet public opinion, and hope the\r\nprogress of sentiment will make future arrangements. He would like the\r\nsystem of his colleague (Hamilton) if it could be established, but it\r\nwas a system without example.\"--_Hamilton's MSS. notes_, Vol. 6, p.\r\n77. Lansing's motion was negatived by six to four States, Maryland\r\nbeing divided.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Yates and Lansing retired finally from the convention on\r\nJuly 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: \"That they acted in accordance with Clinton was proved\r\nby his deportment at this time. Unreserved declarations were made by\r\nhim, that no good was to be expected from the appointment or\r\ndeliberations of this body; that the country would be thrown into\r\nconfusion by the measure. Hamilton said 'Clinton was not a man\r\ngoverned in ordinary cases by sudden impulses; though of an irritable\r\ntemper, when not under the immediate influence of irritation, he was\r\ncircumspect and guarded, and seldom acted or spoke without\r\npremeditation or design.' When the Governor made such declarations,\r\ntherefore, Hamilton feared that Clinton's conduct would induce the\r\nconfusion he so confidently and openly predicted, and to exhibit it\r\nbefore the public in all its deformity, Hamilton published a pointed\r\nanimadversion, charging these declarations upon him, and avowing a\r\nreadiness to substantiate them.\"--John C. Hamilton, _Life of Alexander\r\nHamilton_, Vol. 2, p. 528.]\r\n\r\nHamilton doubted if Madison's plan was strong enough to secure the\r\nobject in view. He suggested a scheme continuing a President and\r\nSenate during good behaviour, and giving the federal government power\r\nto appoint governors of States and to veto state legislation. In the\r\nnotes of a speech presenting this plan, he disclaimed the belief that\r\nit was \"attainable,\" but thought it \"a model which we ought to\r\napproach as near as possible.\"[33] After the Madison plan had been\r\npreferred, however, Hamilton gave it earnest support, and although he\r\ncould not cast New York's vote, since a majority of the State's\r\nrepresentatives had withdrawn, he was privileged to sign the\r\nConstitution. If he had never done anything else, it was glory enough\r\nto have subscribed his name to that immortal record. When Hamilton\r\nreturned home, however, he found himself discredited by a majority of\r\nthe people. \"You were not authorised by the State,\" said Governor\r\nClinton.[34] Richard Morris, the chief justice, remarked to him: \"You\r\nwill find yourself, I fear, in a hornet's nest.\"[35]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Works_, Vol. 1, p. 357. G.T. Curtis, _Commentaries on\r\nthe Constitution_, pp. 371, 381, presents a very careful analysis of\r\nHamilton's plan. For fac-simile copy of Hamilton's plan, see\r\n_Documentary History of the Constitution_ (a recent Government\r\npublication), Vol. 3, p. 771.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: M.E. Lamb, _History of the City of New York_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n318.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Ibid._, Vol. 2, p. 318.]\r\n\r\nOn September 28, 1787, Congress transmitted a draft of the\r\nConstitution, which required the assent of nine of the thirteen\r\nStates, to the several legislatures. At once it became the sole topic\r\nof discussion. In New York it was the occasion of riots, of mobs, and\r\nof violent contests. It was called the \"triple-headed monster,\" and\r\ndeclared to be \"as deep and wicked a conspiracy as ever was invented\r\nin the darkest ages against the liberties of a free people.\" Its\r\nopponents, numbering four-sevenths of the community--although their\r\nstrength was mainly in the country[36]--and calling themselves Federal\r\nRepublicans, organised a society and opened correspondence with\r\nleading men in other States. \"All the old alarm about liberty was now\r\nrevived,\" says W.G. Sumner, \"and all the elements of anarchy and\r\nrepudiation which had been growing so strong for twenty years were\r\narrayed in hostility.\"[37] But its bitterest opponent in the thirteen\r\nColonies was George Clinton.[38] \"He preferred to remain the most\r\npowerful citizen of New York, rather than occupy a subordinate place\r\nunder a national government in which his own State was not\r\nforemost.\"[39] On the other hand, the _Federalist_, written largely by\r\nHamilton, carried conviction to the minds of thousands who had\r\npreviously doubted the wisdom of the plan. In the last number of the\r\nseries, he said: \"The system, though it may not be perfect in every\r\npart, is upon the whole a good one, is the best that the present views\r\nand circumstances will permit, and is such an one as promises every\r\nspecies of security which a reasonable people can desire.\"[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: W.G. Sumner, _Life of Hamilton_, p. 137.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Ibid._, p. 135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: John Fiske, _Critical Period of American History_, p.\r\n340.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: John Fiske, _Essays Historical and Literary_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n118.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Works of Hamilton_, Vol. 9, p. 548.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature opened, Governor Clinton delivered the usual\r\nspeech or message, but he said nothing of what everybody else was\r\ntalking about. Consideration of the Constitution was the only\r\nimportant business before that body; four States had already ratified\r\nit, and three others had it under consideration; yet the Governor said\r\nnot a word. His idea was for New York to hold off and let the others\r\ntry it. Then, if the Union succeeded, although revenue difficulties\r\nwere expected to break it up immediately,[41] the State could come in.\r\nMeantime, like Patrick Henry of Virginia, he proposed another general\r\nconvention, to be held as soon as possible, to consider amendments.\r\nThus matters drifted until January, 1788, when Egbert Benson, now a\r\nmember of the Legislature, offered a resolution for holding a state\r\nconvention to consider the federal document. Dilatory motions blocked\r\nits way, and its friends began to despair of better things; but Benson\r\npersisted, until, at last, after great bitterness, the resolution was\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: W.G. Sumner, _Life of Hamilton_, p. 137.]\r\n\r\nOf the sixty-one delegates to this convention, which assembled at the\r\ncourthouse in Poughkeepsie on June 17, two-thirds were opposed to the\r\nConstitution.[42] The convention organised with Governor Clinton for\r\npresident. Among the champions of the Constitution appeared Hamilton,\r\nJay, Robert R. Livingston, Robert Morris, James Duane, then mayor of\r\nNew York, John Sloss Hobart, Richard Harrison, and others of like\r\ncharacter. Robert Yates, Samuel Jones, Melancthon Smith, and John\r\nLansing, Jr., led the fight against it. Beginning on June 19, the\r\ndiscussion continued until July 28. Hamilton, his eloquence at its\r\nbest, so that at times there was not a dry eye in the assembly,[43]\r\nespecially emphasised the public debt. \"It is a fact that should\r\nstrike us with shame, that we are obliged to borrow money in order to\r\npay the interest of our debt. It is a fact that these debts are\r\naccumulating every day by compound interest.\"[44] In the old\r\nConfederation, he declared, the idea of liberty alone was considered,\r\nbut that another thing was equally important--\"I mean a principle of\r\nstrength and stability in the organisation of our government, and of\r\nvigour in its operations.\"[45] Professor Sumner, in his admirable\r\nbiography, expresses surprise that nothing is said about debts in the\r\n_Federalist_, and comparatively little about the Supreme Court. \"This\r\nis very remarkable,\" he says, \"in view of the subsequent history; for\r\nif there is any 'sleeping giant' in the Constitution, it has proved to\r\nbe the power of the Supreme Court to pass upon the constitutionality\r\nof laws. It does not appear that Hamilton or anybody else foresaw that\r\nthis function of the Court would build upon the written constitution a\r\nbody of living constitutional law.\"[46]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Ibid._, 137.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: M.E. Lamb, _History of the City of New York_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n320.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Hamilton's Works_, Vol. 1, p. 491.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _Ibid._, p. 449.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: W.G. Sumner, _Life of Hamilton_, p. 139.]\r\n\r\nMelancthon Smith was the ablest opponent of the Constitution. Familiar\r\nwith political history, and one of the ablest debaters in the country,\r\nhe proved himself no mean antagonist even for Hamilton. \"He must have\r\nbeen a man of rare candour, too,\" says John Fiske, \"for after weeks of\r\ndebate he owned himself convinced.\"[47] Whatever could be said against\r\nthe Constitution, Smith voiced it; and there was apparent merit in\r\nsome of his objections. To a majority of the people, New York appeared\r\nto be surrendering natural advantages in much larger measure than\r\nother Commonwealths, while its concession of political power struck\r\nthem as not unlikely to endanger the personal liberty of the citizen\r\nand the independence of the State. They disliked the idea of a far-off\r\ngovernment, with many officers drawing large salaries, administering\r\nthe army, the navy, and the diplomatic relations with nations of the\r\nOld World. It was so different from anything experienced since their\r\nseparation from England, that they dreaded this centralised power;\r\nand, to minimise it, they proposed several amendments, among them one\r\nthat no person should be eligible to the office of President for a\r\nthird term. Time has demonstrated the wisdom of some of these\r\nsuggestions; but commendable as they now appear after the lapse of\r\nmore than a century, they were of trifling importance compared to the\r\nnecessity for a closer, stronger union of the States in 1787.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: John Fiske, _Essays Historical and Literary_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n125.]\r\n\r\nFederalists were much alarmed over the failure of New York to ratify.\r\nAlthough the State ranked only fifth in population, commercially it\r\nwas the centre of the Union. From the standpoint of military\r\nmovements, too, it had been supremely important in the days of\r\nMontcalm and Burgoyne, and it was felt that a Federal Union cut in\r\ntwain by the Mohawk and Hudson valleys must have a short life. \"For my\r\nown part,\" said Hamilton, \"the more I can penetrate the views of the\r\nanti-federal party in this State, the more I dread the consequences of\r\nthe non-adoption of the Constitution by any of the other States--the\r\nmore I fear eventual disunion and civil war.\"[48] His fear bred an\r\napparent willingness to agree to a conditional ratification,[49] until\r\nMadison settled the question that there could be no such thing as\r\nconditional ratification since constitutional secession would be\r\nabsurd. On July 11 Jay moved that \"the Constitution be ratified, and\r\nthat whatever amendments might be deemed expedient should be\r\nrecommended.\" This, however, did not satisfy the opposition, and the\r\ndiscussion continued.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Hamilton's Works_, Vol. 8, p. 187.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Ibid._, p. 191.]\r\n\r\nHamilton, however, did not rely upon argument alone. He arranged for\r\nnews of the Virginia and New Hampshire conventions, and while Clinton,\r\nclinging to his demand for conditional ratification, still hesitated,\r\nword came from New Hampshire, by a system of horse expresses, telling\r\nthe glad story that the requisite number of States had been secured.\r\nThis reduced the question to ratification or secession. A few days\r\nlater it was learned that Virginia had also joined the majority. The\r\nsupport of Patrick Henry had been a tower of strength to Governor\r\nClinton, and his defeat exaggerated Clinton's fear that New York City\r\nand the southern counties which favoured the Constitution might now\r\nexecute their threat to split off unless New York ratified. Then came\r\nMelancthon Smith's change to the federalist side. This was like\r\ncrushing the centre of a hostile army. Finally, on July 28, a\r\nresolution \"that the Constitution be ratified _in full confidence_\r\nthat the amendments proposed by this convention will be adopted,\"\r\nreceived a vote of thirty to twenty-seven. Governor Clinton did not\r\nvote, but it was known that he advised several of his friends to\r\nfavour the resolution. On September 13, he officially proclaimed the\r\nFederal Constitution as the fundamental law of the Republic.\r\n\r\nPosterity has never severely criticised George Clinton's opposition to\r\nnational development. His sincerity and patriotism have been accepted.\r\nTo Washington and Hamilton, however, his conduct seemed like a cold\r\nand selfish desertion of his country at the moment of its utmost\r\nperil. \"The men who oppose a strong and energetic government,\" wrote\r\nWashington to Hamilton on July 10, 1787, the day of Yates' and\r\nLansing's retirement from the Philadelphia convention, \"are, in my\r\nopinion, narrow-minded politicians, or are under the influence of\r\nlocal views.\" This reference to \"local views\" meant George Clinton,\r\nupon whose advice Yates and Lansing acted, and who declared\r\nunreservedly that only confusion could come to the country from a\r\nconvention and a measure wholly unnecessary, since the Confederation,\r\nif given sufficient trial, would probably answer all the purposes of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nThe march of events has so clearly proved the wisdom of Hamilton and\r\nthe unwisdom of Clinton, that the name of one, joined inseparably with\r\nthat of Washington, has grown with the century, until it is as much a\r\npart of the history of the Union as the Constitution itself. The name\r\nof George Clinton, on the contrary, is little known beyond the limits\r\nof his native State. It remained for DeWitt Clinton, the Governor's\r\ndistinguished nephew, to link the family with an historic enterprise\r\nwhich should bring it down through the ages with increasing respect\r\nand admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCLINTON'S FOURTH TERM\r\n\r\n1789-1792\r\n\r\n\r\nAt each triennial election for twelve years, ever since the adoption\r\nof the State Constitution in 1777, George Clinton had been chosen\r\ngovernor. No one else, in fact, had ever been seriously talked of,\r\nsave John Jay in 1786. Doubtless Clinton derived some advantage from\r\nthe control of appointments, which multiplied in number and increased\r\nin influence as term succeeded term, but his popularity drew its\r\ninspiration from sources other than patronage. A strong, rugged\r\ncharacter, and a generous, sympathetic nature, sunk their roots deeply\r\ninto the hearts of a liberty-loving people who supported their\r\nfavourite with the fidelity of personal friendship.\r\n\r\nThe time had, however, come at last when Clinton's right to continue\r\nas governor was to be contested. Hamilton's encounter with the New\r\nYork opponents of the Federal Constitution had been vigorous and\r\nacrimonious. It was easy to stand with one's State in opposing the\r\nConstitution when opposition had behind it the powerful Clinton\r\ninterest and the persuasive Clinton argument that federal union meant\r\nthe substitution of experiment for experience, and the exchange of a\r\nsuperior for an inferior position; but it required a splendid\r\nstubbornness to face, daringly and aggressively, the desperate odds\r\narrayed against the Constitution. Every man who wanted to curry favour\r\nwith Clinton was ready to strike at Hamilton, and they covered him\r\nwith obloquy. Very likely his attitude was not one to tempt the\r\nforbearance of angry opponents. He did not fight with gloves.\r\nNevertheless, his success added one more to his list of splendid\r\nvictories. He had beaten Clinton in his intolerant treatment of\r\nloyalists; he had beaten him in obtaining for Congress the sole power\r\nof regulating commerce; he had beaten him in the Philadelphia\r\nconvention called to frame a federal constitution; he had beaten him\r\nin a state convention called to ratify that constitution; and now he\r\nproposed to beat him for governor in a State which would have great\r\ninfluence in smoothing the way for the new federal government.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the Revolution, there had been local parties in the\r\nvarious Stales, divided on issues of hard and soft money, on imposts,\r\non treatment of Tories, and on state rights, and these issues had\r\ncoincided in many of the States. During the contest growing out of the\r\nadoption of the Federal Constitution, all these elements became\r\nsegregated into two great political parties, those who supported the\r\nConstitution being known as Federalists--those who were opposed to\r\nstrengthening the bond between the States being called anti-Federalists.\r\nThe latter were clearly in the majority in New York, and Hamilton\r\nrightly inferred that, notwithstanding the people, since the adoption\r\nof the Constitution, manifested a disposition to sustain the general\r\ngovernment, a large majority of freeholders, having heretofore\r\nsupported Clinton as a wise, patriotic governor, would not now desert\r\nhim for an out-and-out Federalist. To meet this emergency, several\r\nFederalists, at a meeting held February 11, 1789, nominated Robert\r\nYates, an anti-Federalist judge of the Supreme Court, hoping thus to\r\nform a coalition with the more moderate men of his party.\r\n\r\nIn support of such politics, of the doubtful wisdom of which there was\r\nabundant illustration in the recent unnatural coalition between Lord\r\nNorth and the brilliant Charles James Fox, Hamilton wrote to his\r\nfriends in Albany that in settling upon a candidate, some difficulties\r\noccurred. \"Our fellow citizens in some parts of the State,\" he said,\r\n\"had proposed Judge Yates, others had been advocates of\r\nLieutenant-Governor Van Cortlandt, and others for Chief Justice\r\nMorris. It is well known that the inhabitants of this city are, with\r\nfew exceptions, strongly attached to the new Constitution. It is also\r\nwell known that the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Justice, whom we\r\nrespect and esteem, were zealous advocates for the same cause. Had it\r\nbeen agreed to support either of them for governor, there would have\r\nbeen reason to fear that the measure would have been imputed to party,\r\nand not to a desire of relieving our country from the evils they\r\nexperience from the heats of party. It appeared, therefore, most\r\nadvisable to elect some man of the opposite party, in whose integrity,\r\npatriotism, and temper, confidence might be placed, however little his\r\npolitical opinions on the question lately agitated might be approved\r\nby those who were assembled upon that occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Among the persons of this description, there were circumstances which\r\nled to a decision in favour of Judge Yates. It is certain that as a\r\nman and a judge he is generally esteemed. And, though his opposition\r\nto the new Constitution was such as his friends cannot but disapprove,\r\nyet, since the period of its adoption, his conduct has been tempered\r\nwith a degree of moderation, and seems to point him out as a man\r\nlikely to compose the differences of the State. Of this at least we\r\nfeel confident, that he has no personal revenge to gratify, no\r\nopponents to oppress, no partisans to provide for, nor any promises\r\nfor personal purposes to be performed at the public expense.\"[50]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 1, p. 509.]\r\n\r\nTo many the selection of Robert Yates seemed almost ungracious. The\r\nFederalists wanted Richard Morris, chief justice of the Supreme Court,\r\nwho had encouraged the establishment of a strong government, and, as a\r\nmember of the Poughkeepsie convention, had voted to ratify the Federal\r\nConstitution. Besides, he was a gentleman of the old school, of\r\ninflexible integrity, firm and decided in character, whose full,\r\nrounded face and commanding presence appeared to advantage among the\r\nstately and dignified personages who supported knee breeches and silk\r\nstockings, and displayed the delicate ruffles of a shirt under the\r\nfolds of a rich velvet coat. Hamilton was fond of Morris, and\r\nrecognised the justice of his claims. Their views in no wise differed,\r\ntheir families were intimate, and at the Poughkeepsie convention,\r\nafter listening for three hours to Hamilton's speech, Morris had\r\npronounced it the ablest argument and most patriotic address ever\r\nheard in the State of New York. But the great Federalist, determined\r\nto destroy Clinton, wanted availability, not fidelity, and so Morris\r\ndeclined in favour of Yates.\r\n\r\nIn everything Robert Yates was an anti-Federalist. He dressed like one\r\nand he talked like one. He had been an opponent of the Federal\r\nConstitution, an advocate of the doctrine of state supremacy, and an\r\nardent supporter of the Governor. With Clinton's approval he had\r\nwithdrawn from the Philadelphia convention when the majority favoured\r\na strong government wielding supreme authority; with Clinton's\r\napproval, he had opposed the ratification of the Federal Constitution\r\nin the state convention at Poughkeepsie, and with Clinton's approval\r\nhe declined to change his vote, although New Hampshire's action and\r\nHamilton's speech had already settled the question of ratification.\r\nWhat Hamilton proposed, Yates opposed; what Clinton advocated, Yates\r\napproved. After the ratification of the Constitution, however, Robert\r\nYates charged the grand jury that it would be little short of treason\r\nagainst the Republic to disobey it. \"Let me exhort you, gentlemen,\" he\r\nsaid, \"not only in your capacity as grand jurors, but in your more\r\ndurable and equally respectable character as citizens, to preserve\r\ninviolate this charter of our national rights and safety, a charter\r\nsecond only in dignity and importance to the Declaration of our\r\nIndependence.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the bench Yates distinguished himself for impartiality and\r\nindependence, if not for learning. He abated the intemperate zeal of\r\npatriotic juries, and he refused to convict men suspected of\r\ndisloyalty, without proof. On one occasion he sent a jury back four\r\ntimes to reconsider a verdict of guilty unauthorised by the evidence,\r\nand subsequently treated with indifference a legislative threat of\r\nimpeachment, based upon a fearless discharge of duty. He could afford\r\nto be just, for, like George Clinton, he had early embraced the cause\r\nof the Colony against the Crown. From an Albany alderman he became a\r\nmaker of the State Constitution, and from a writer of patriotic\r\nessays, he shone as an active member of the Committee of Safety.\r\nTogether with John Jay and Robert R. Livingston, he had obstructed the\r\npassage of Lord Howe's ships up the Hudson, and with General Schuyler\r\nhe devised measures to repel the British from the northern and western\r\nfrontier. He had helped to fix the dividing line between Massachusetts\r\nand New York, and, as one of the Council of Administration, he\r\ngoverned southern New York from the withdrawal of the British until\r\nthe assembling of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nHaving decided to go outside his own party, Hamilton made no mistake\r\nin picking his man. If Clinton was the Hampden of the colonial period,\r\nRobert Yates could well be called its Pym. He had toleration as well\r\nas patriotism. But he also had an itching desire for office. Some one\r\nhas said that the close connection between man and a child is never\r\nmore clearly illustrated than in the joy and pride which the wisest\r\nstatesman feels in the wearing of a ribbon or a star. It could not be\r\nsaid of Robert Yates then, as it was said, with good reason, six years\r\nlater, that his desire for office extinguished his devotion to party\r\nand his character for political consistency, but it was openly charged\r\nthat, upon the suggestion of Hamilton, he urged the grand jury to\r\nsupport the Federal Constitution in order to strengthen himself with\r\nthe Federalists. Whether this be true or not, Yates' previous devotion\r\nto the anti-Federalist party set his present conduct in sharp contrast\r\nto that of other distinguished anti-Federalist statesmen of the\r\ntime--to men like Samuel Jones and Melancthon Smith, who accepted the\r\naction of the Poughkeepsie convention, but supported George Clinton.\r\n\"Men, not principles, are involved,\" they declared.\r\n\r\nAll that we know of Yates would seem to deny his surrender of\r\nprinciple, or his condescension to any act of baseness, to obtain\r\noffice. It was indeed a question whether Clinton, or Hamilton through\r\nYates, should control the state government; but the gubernatorial\r\ncontest involved more than that. The new government, soon to be placed\r\non trial, needed the help of sympathetic governors and legislatures,\r\nand Clinton and his supporters, forced to accept the Constitution,\r\ncould hardly be regarded as its wisest and safest guardians. From\r\nHamilton's standpoint, therefore, it was more principle than men.\r\nHowever agreeable to him it might be to defeat and humiliate Clinton,\r\ngreater satisfaction must spring from the consciousness that while in\r\nits leading-strings, at least, the general government would have the\r\nhearty support of New York.\r\n\r\nHamilton's great coalition, intended to work such wonders, boasted\r\nmany brilliant names. Of the younger men Robert Troup, of Hamilton's\r\nage, an early friend of Burr, took a most conspicuous part, while\r\namong the older members of this galaxy was James Duane, a lawyer of\r\nrare ability, the first mayor of New York, for ten years continuously\r\nin the Continental Congress, a man of great force, of large wealth,\r\nand superb character. He was in his forties when Hamilton, a boy of\r\nseventeen, won his heart by a single speech, denouncing the act of\r\nParliament which closed the port of Boston. The most notable man in\r\nthe coalition, next to Hamilton and Jay, was Robert R. Livingston, now\r\nHamilton's devoted friend, before long to be his bitter enemy. He was\r\nstill young, little more than forty, but in everything he was bold and\r\nskilful, vigorous as a writer, eloquent as a speaker, deeply learned\r\nas a jurist, and rich in scholarship. Of the same age as Livingston\r\nwas William Duer,[51] who started at eighteen as an aide to Lord Clive\r\nin India. Duer was at one time the most useful man in America. Nobody\r\ncould cheat him. As soon as Hamilton became secretary of the\r\ntreasury, he made Duer assistant secretary, an office which he held\r\nwith credit until 1790, when he resigned to become the chief of a ring\r\nof speculators, who, two years later, left him insolvent and in jail.\r\nHamilton's coalition also furnished the only instance of the political\r\nassociation of himself and Burr, although Burr's support of Yates is\r\nsaid to have been personal rather than political. The story is that\r\nBurr, seeking admission to the bar after reading law less than a year,\r\ninduced Judge Yates to suspend the rule requiring three years of\r\nstudy, because of the applicant's term as a soldier, a service that\r\nlaid the foundation of a lasting friendship.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: It was his son, William Alexander Duer, the brilliant\r\nand accomplished writer, who presided for thirteen years with such\r\ndistinguished ability over Columbia College.]\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side were many men who live in history as builders of\r\nthe Empire State. None belong to the gallery of national characters,\r\nperhaps, but John Lansing, Livingston's successor as chancellor, and\r\nSamuel Jones,[52] the first state comptroller, known, by common\r\nconsent, as the father of the New York bar, find places in the list of\r\nNew York's ablest statesmen. To this memorable company also belonged\r\nMelancthon Smith, the head of the anti-Federalist forces at the\r\nPoughkeepsie convention, and Gilbert Livingston of Dutchess, whose one\r\npatriotic address was the last blow needed to ratify the Constitution.\r\nHe was not, like Smith, a great debater, but his ready eloquence\r\nclassed him among the orators who were destined to live in the memory\r\nof a later generation. Beside him was James Clinton, brother of the\r\nGovernor and father of DeWitt Clinton. A soldier by profession, he had\r\ntaken part in several important battles and marches, charging with\r\nBradstreet at the capture of Fort Frontenac, following the lamented\r\nMontgomery to Quebec, and serving with Sullivan in his famous\r\nexpedition against the Indians. Finally, he shared in the glory of\r\nbeing with Washington at the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. He seems to\r\nhave been the real soldier of the family, blending the strong, active\r\npowers of the Clinton mind with the gentler virtues which made him as\r\nsympathetic on the field as he was affectionate in the home.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: \"No one,\" said Chancellor Kent, writing of Samuel Jones,\r\n\"surpassed him in clearness of intellect and in moderation and\r\nsimplicity of character; no one equalled him in his accurate knowledge\r\nof the technical rules and doctrines of real property, and his\r\nfamiliarity with the skilful and elaborate, but now obsolete and\r\nmysterious, black-letter learning of the common law.\"]\r\n\r\nThus the contest between Yates and Clinton, although the first real\r\npolitical conflict in the history of the State, became one of the\r\nsharpest and most bitterly fought. For six weeks the atmosphere was\r\nthick and hot with political passion. Veteran observers declared that\r\ntheir generation had seen nothing like it. But the arguments of Duer,\r\nthe powerful influence of Chancellor Livingston, the leadership of\r\nHamilton, and the phenomenal popularity of John Jay, could not win the\r\nvoters who saw nothing more in the arrangement than a question of\r\nindividual preference, and while Yates carried the western district by\r\na large majority and held his own in the southern, Clinton's home\r\ncounty gave him 1093 out of 1245 votes, making his majority 429 in a\r\ntotal vote of 12,353.\r\n\r\nThe call for the Governor was so close that he quickly prepared for a\r\nrepetition of the contest in 1792. The inauguration of Washington on\r\nApril 30 had given Hamilton control of the federal offices in New\r\nYork, and, although of trifling importance compared to state\r\npatronage, they were used to strengthen federalism, and, if possible,\r\nto destroy Clinton. John Jay became chief justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt, James Duane judge of the District Court, Richard Harrison\r\nUnited States attorney, and William S. Smith United States marshal. It\r\nwas a brilliant array of talent and legal learning. Of the lights and\r\nornaments of the law in his day, Richard Harrison excelled in an\r\nintimate knowledge of its intricacies and mysteries. Added to these\r\nofficials were Rufus King and Philip Schuyler, United States senators,\r\nand three members of Congress, with Egbert Benson at their head. As\r\nsecretary of the treasury and the trusted friend of the President,\r\nHamilton had also multiplied his personal influence.\r\n\r\nGovernor Clinton felt the full force of the Federalist combination,\r\nthe fear of which had intensified his hostility to the Union; but he\r\ngoverned his conduct with the toleration and foresight of a master\r\npolitician. He declined to punish those who had deserted his standard,\r\nrefusing to accept Robert Yates' apostacy as sufficient cause to bar\r\nhis promotion as chief justice, and appointing to the vacancy John\r\nLansing, Jr., who, although a strong anti-Federalist, had already\r\nshown an independence of political domination.\r\n\r\nBut the master-stroke of Clinton's diplomacy displayed itself in the\r\nappointment of Aaron Burr as attorney-general. After Burr left the\r\narmy \"with the character of a true knight,\" as John Adams put it, he\r\nbegan the practice of law at Albany. Later he removed to New York,\r\ntaking up his home in Maiden Lane. Thus far his political career,\r\nlimited to two terms in the Legislature, had been insignificant.\r\nDuring the great controversy over the Federal Constitution he remained\r\nsilent. His silence, however, was the silence of concealment. He\r\nshared no confidences, he exploited no principles, he did nothing in\r\nthe open. He lived in an air of mystery, writing letters in cipher,\r\nusing messengers instead of the mails, and maintaining espionage upon\r\nthe movements of others. Of himself he wrote to Theodosia, \"he is a\r\ngrave, silent, strange sort of animal, inasmuch that we know not what\r\nto make of him.\" In the political parlance of to-day, his methods\r\nsavoured of the \"still hunt,\" and in their exercise he exhibited the\r\npowers of a past-master in stirring up men's prejudices, and creating\r\ndivisions among his rivals; but his methods, whether practised in law\r\nor in politics, were neither modern nor moral. He marshalled forces\r\nwith equal celerity under either flag.\r\n\r\nShortly after Burr moved into Maiden Lane, Hamilton made his home in\r\nWall Street. Their first meeting, which occurred on the road from\r\nHarlem bridge to White Plains during the disastrous retreat of\r\nWashington's army from Manhattan in September, 1776, had been\r\ncharacterised by mutual dislike. Burr, with the rank of major, acted\r\nas aide to General Putnam; Hamilton, as an officer of artillery, was\r\nsoon to become an aide to Washington. Both were young then--Hamilton\r\nnot yet twenty, Burr scarcely twenty-one; yet their character, then\r\nfully developed, shines out in their estimate of the commander-in-chief.\r\nBurr thought Washington inferior as an officer, and weak, though\r\nhonest, as a man; Hamilton thought him a great soldier and a great\r\nstatesman, upon whose services the welfare of the country largely\r\ndepended. Burr's prejudices settled into positive dislike; Hamilton's\r\nappreciation voiced the sentiment of the people and the judgment of\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nThere is a legend that from the first, destiny seemed determined to\r\noppose the genius and fame of Hamilton with the genius and fame of\r\nAaron Burr. It is certainly a remarkable coincidence that two men,\r\nborn without the State, so nearly of an age, so similar in brilliant\r\nattainments, so notably distinguished in charm of manner and\r\nphenomenal accomplishments, and so strikingly alike in ripeness of\r\nintelligence and bent of ambition, should happen to have lived at the\r\nsame time, in the same city, and become members of the same\r\nprofession; yet it is not surprising that these men should prove\r\nformidable rivals and deadly foes, since difference in character was\r\nfar more real than resemblance of mental attainments. Both were\r\nfearless and brave, but the one was candid, frank and resolute; the\r\nother subtle, crafty and adventurous. Perhaps their only common\r\ncharacteristic was an ungoverned admiration for the charms of women,\r\nthough, unlike Burr, Hamilton neither bragged of his amours, nor\r\nboasted that success attended his pursuit of pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be supposed that in appointing Burr attorney-general,\r\nClinton did not have in mind the necessity of securing to the ranks of\r\nthe anti-Federalists all talented and spirited young men; but it is\r\nnone the less evident that Clinton was thinking more of himself than\r\nof his party. Burr figured as an ugly opponent in the recent campaign.\r\nBesides, he possessed the happy faculty of surrounding himself with\r\nyoung men who recognised in him a superlative combination of bravery,\r\nchivalry, and ability. Hamilton called them \"Burr's myrmidons,\" but\r\nTheodosia, with a daughter's devotion and diplomatic zeal, entitled\r\nthem \"the Tenth Legion.\" They had joined Burr when a violent Whig in\r\n1784, sending him to the Assembly for two terms; they had rallied\r\nunder his call to the Sons of Liberty, attracting the fierce fire of\r\nHamilton; and they had broken party bonds to support Robert Yates\r\nbecause of their chief's personal friendship.\r\n\r\nSuch a man would attract the attention of any political manager, and\r\nalthough Clinton up to this time had had no particular relations with\r\nBurr, the latter's enthusiastic support of Yates accentuated his\r\npolitical value. In after years Burr declared that Clinton had always\r\nbeen his rival, and Clinton no less frankly avowed his distrust of\r\nBurr, charging him with always being \"for sale;\" but Burr's rivalry\r\nand Clinton's distrust do not date back to 1790.\r\n\r\nIf Clinton thought himself fortunate in gaining Burr, he was still\r\nmore fortunate in the defection of the influential Livingstons. What\r\nCæsar said of Gaul used to be said of the Empire State, that all New\r\nYork was divided into three parts--the Clintons, the Livingstons, and\r\nthe Schuylers. Parton said \"the Clintons had power, the Livingstons\r\nhad numbers, and the Schuylers had Hamilton.\"[53] In 1788 seven\r\nmembers of the Livingston family, with the Schuylers, had overthrown\r\nthe Clintons, and turned the Confederation into the Union. Robert R.\r\nLivingston, standing at their head, was the exponent of a liberal\r\npolicy toward all American citizens, and the champion of a broader\r\nnational life. His associates were the leading Federalists; his\r\nprinciples were the pillars of his party; and his ambitions centred in\r\nthe success and strength of his country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: James Parton, _Life of Aaron Burr_, Vol. 1, p. 169. \"New\r\nYork, much more than New England, was the home of natural leaders and\r\nfamily alliances. John Jay, the governor; the Schuylers, led by Philip\r\nSchuyler and his son-in-law, Alexander Hamilton; the Livingstons, led\r\nby Robert R. Livingston, with a promising younger brother, Edward,\r\nnearly twenty years his junior, and a brother-in-law, John Armstrong,\r\nbesides Samuel Osgood, Morgan Lewis and Smith Thompson, other\r\nconnections by marriage with the great Livingston stock; the Clintons,\r\nheaded by George, the governor, and supported by the energy of DeWitt,\r\nhis nephew,--all these Jays, Schuylers, Livingstons, Clintons, had\r\nthey lived in New England, would probably have united in the support\r\nof their class; but being citizens of New York they quarrelled.\"--Henry\r\nAdams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 1, pp. 108-09.]\r\n\r\nPrudence, therefore, if no higher motive, required that the\r\nLivingstons be not overlooked in the division of federal patronage.\r\nThere was much of it to divide. Besides cabinet positions and judicial\r\nappointments, the foreign service offered rare opportunities to a few\r\naccomplished statesmen and recognised scholars. Robert R. Livingston,\r\nas chancellor of New York, stood in line of promotion for chief\r\njustice of the United States Supreme Court, but John Jay stood nearer\r\nto Hamilton, just as Philip Schuyler did when United States senators\r\nwere chosen. Other honourable and most desirable positions, however,\r\nwere open. John Quincy Adams thought a mission to England or France\r\nbetter than the Cabinet, but Gouverneur Morris went to France, Thomas\r\nPinckney to England, William Short to Spain, and David Humphreys to\r\nPortugal. The Livingstons were left out.\r\n\r\nHamilton's funding system, especially the proposed assumption of state\r\ndebts, then dividing the public mind, afforded plausible cause for\r\nopposing federalism; and ostensibly for this reason, the Livingstons\r\nceased to be Federalists. Some of the less conspicuous members,\r\nresidents of Columbia County, continued their adherence, but the\r\nstatesmen who give the family its name in history wanted nothing more\r\nof a party whose head was a \"young adventurer,\" a man \"not native to\r\nthe soil,\" a \"merchant's clerk from the West Indies.\" The story is\r\nthat the Chancellor convened the family and made the separation so\r\ncomplete that Washington's subsequent offer of the mission to France\r\nfailed to secure his return.\r\n\r\nThe first notice of the Livingston break was in the election of a\r\nUnited States senator in 1791. Philip Schuyler, Hamilton's\r\nfather-in-law, confidently expected a re-election. His selection for\r\nthe short term was with this understanding. But several members of the\r\nAssembly, nominally Federalists, were friendly to Clinton, who\r\npreferred Aaron Burr to Schuyler because of Hamilton's influence over\r\nhim;[54] and when the Governor promised Morgan Lewis, the Chancellor's\r\nbrother-in-law, Burr's place as attorney-general, Livingston's\r\ndisposition to injure Hamilton became intensified, and to the\r\ndisappointment of Schuyler, the vote of the Legislature disclosed a\r\nsmall majority for Burr.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: In a letter to Theodorus Bailey, Chancellor Kent, then a\r\nmember of the Assembly, expressed the opinion that \"things look\r\nauspicious for Burr. It will be in some measure a question of northern\r\nand southern interests. The objection of Schuyler's being related to\r\nthe Secretary has weight.\"--William Kent, _Memoirs and Letters of\r\nJames Kent_, p. 39.]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conjecture that the haughty, unpopular, aristocratic old\r\nGeneral[55] would not be as acceptable as a young man of thirty-five,\r\nfascinating in manner, gifted in speech, and not yet openly and\r\noffensively partisan; but it needed something more than this charm of\r\npersonality to line up the hard-headed, self-reliant legislator\r\nagainst Hamilton and Philip Schuyler, and Burr found it in his appeal\r\nto Clinton, and in the clever brother-in-law suggestion to Livingston.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: \"The defeat of Schuyler was attributed partly to the\r\nunprepossessing austerity of his manner.\"--_Ibid._, p. 38.]\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Schuyler was a staggering blow to Hamilton. The great\r\nstatesman had achieved success as secretary of the treasury, but as a\r\npolitical manager, his lack of tact, impatience of control, and\r\ninfirmity of temper, had crippled the organisation. In less than three\r\nyears the party had lost a United States senator, suffered the\r\nseparation of a family vastly more important than federal appointees,\r\nand sacrificed the prestige of victory, so necessary to political\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nGEORGE CLINTON DEFEATS JOHN JAY\r\n\r\n1792-1795\r\n\r\n\r\nBurr's rapid advancement gave full rein to his ambition. Not content\r\nwith the exalted office to which he had suddenly fallen heir, he now\r\nbegan looking for higher honours; and when it came time to select\r\ncandidates for governor, he invoked the tactics that won him a place\r\nin the United States Senate. He found a few anti-Federalists willing\r\nto talk of him as a stronger candidate than George Clinton, and a few\r\nFederalists who claimed that the moderate men of both parties would\r\nrally to his support. In the midst of the talk Isaac Ledyard wrote\r\nHamilton that \"a tide was likely to make strongly for Mr. Burr,\"[56]\r\nand James Watson, in a similar strain, argued that Burr's chances, if\r\nsupported by Federalists, would be \"strong.\"[57]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: James Parton, _Life of Aaron Burr_, Vol. 1, p. 187.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _Ibid._, 188.]\r\n\r\nClinton's firm hold upon his party quickly checked Burr's hope from\r\nthat quarter, but the increasing difficulty among Federalists to find\r\na candidate offered opportunity for Burr's peculiar tactics, until his\r\nadherents were everywhere--on the bench, in the Legislature, in the\r\ndrawing-rooms, the coffee-houses, and the streets. Hamilton had only\r\nto present him and say, \"Here is your candidate,\" and Aaron Burr would\r\ncheerfully have opposed the friend who, within less than two years,\r\nhad appointed him attorney-general and elected him United States\r\nsenator. But Hamilton deliberately snuffed him out. The great\r\nFederalist had finally induced John Jay to become the candidate of his\r\nparty. This was on February 13, 1792. Two days later, the\r\nanti-Federalists named George Clinton and Pierre Van Cortlandt, the\r\nold ticket which had done service for fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn inducing John Jay to lead his party, Hamilton made a good start.\r\nHeretofore Jay had steadily refused to become a candidate for\r\ngovernor. \"That the office of the first magistrate of the State,\" he\r\nwrote, May 16, 1777, \"will be more respectable as well as more\r\nlucrative than the place I now fill is very apparent; but my object in\r\nthe course of the present great contest neither has been nor will be\r\neither rank or money.\"[58] After his return from Europe, when Governor\r\nClinton's division of patronage and treatment of royalists had become\r\nintensely objectionable, Jay was again urged to stand as a candidate,\r\nbut he answered that \"a servant should not leave a good old master for\r\nthe sake of more pay or a prettier livery.\"[59] If this was good\r\nreasoning in 1786 and 1789, when he was secretary of foreign affairs,\r\nit was better reasoning in 1792, when he was chief justice of the\r\nUnited States; but the pleadings of Hamilton seem to have set a\r\npresidential bee buzzing, or, at least, to have started ambition in a\r\nmind until now without ambition. At any rate, Jay, suddenly and\r\nwithout any apparent reason, consented to exchange the most exalted\r\noffice next to President, to chance the New York governorship.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Ibid._, p. 198.]\r\n\r\nThere had never been a time since John Jay entered public life that he\r\nwas not the most popular man in the city of New York. In 1788 he\r\nreceived for delegate to the Poughkeepsie convention, twenty-seven\r\nhundred and thirty-five votes out of a total of twenty-eight hundred\r\nand thirty-three. John Adams called him \"a Roman\" because he resembled\r\nCato more than any of his contemporaries. Jay's life divided itself\r\ninto three distinct epochs of twenty-eight years each--study and the\r\npractice of law, public employment, and retirement. During the years\r\nof uninterrupted public life, he ran the gamut of office-holding. It\r\nis a long catalogue, including delegate to the Continental Congress,\r\nframer of the New York Constitution, chief justice of the New York\r\nSupreme Court, president of the Continental Congress, minister to\r\nSpain, member of the Peace Commission, secretary of foreign affairs,\r\nchief justice of the United States Supreme Court, negotiator of the\r\nJay treaty, and finally governor of New York. No other American save\r\nJohn Quincy Adams and John Marshall ever served his country so\r\ncontinuously in such exalted and responsible place. On his return from\r\nEurope after an absence of five years, Adams said he returned to his\r\ncountry \"like a bee to its hive, with both legs loaded with merit and\r\nhonour.\"[60]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: To Thos. Barclay, May 24, 1784, _Hist. Mag._, 1869, p.\r\n358.]\r\n\r\nJay accepted the nomination for governor in 1792, on condition that he\r\nbe not asked to take part in the campaign. \"I made it a rule,\" he\r\nwrote afterward, \"neither to begin correspondence nor conversation\r\nupon the subject.\"[61] Accordingly, while New York was deeply stirred,\r\nthe Chief Justice leisurely rode over his circuit, out of hearing and\r\nout of sight of the political disturbance, apparently indifferent to\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 289.]\r\n\r\nThe real political campaign which is still periodically made in New\r\nYork, may be said to have had its beginning in April, 1792. Seldom has\r\nan election been contested with such prodigality of partisan fury. The\r\nrhetoric of abuse was vigorous and unrestrained; the campaign lie\r\nactive and ingenious; the arraignment of class against class sedulous\r\nand adroit, and the excitement most violent and memorable. If a weapon\r\nof political warfare failed to be handled with craft and with courage,\r\nits skilful use was unknown.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if any one doubts that it was a real time of political\r\nupheaval, he has only to glance at local histories. Federalists and\r\nanti-Federalists were alike convulsed by a movement which was the\r\noffspring of a genuine and irresistible enthusiasm of that strong,\r\nfar-reaching kind that makes epochs in the history of politics. The\r\npeople having cut loose from royalty, now proposed cutting loose from\r\nsilk stockings, knee breeches, powdered hair, pigtails, shoe buckles,\r\nand ruffled shirts--the emblems of nobility. Perhaps they did not then\r\ncare for the red plush waistcoats, the yarn stockings, and the\r\nslippers down at the heel, which Jefferson was to carry into the White\r\nHouse; but in their effort to overthrow the tyranny of the past, they\r\nwere beginning to demand broader suffrage and less ceremony, a larger,\r\nfreer man, and less caste. To them, therefore, Jay and Clinton\r\nrepresented the aristocrat and the democrat. Jay, they said, had been\r\nnurtured in the lap of ease, Clinton had worked his way from the most\r\nhumble rank; Jay luxuriated in splendid courts, Clinton dwelt in the\r\nhome of the lowly son of toil; Jay was the choice of the rich, Clinton\r\nthe man of the people; Jay relied upon the support of the President\r\nand the Secretary of the Treasury, Clinton upon the poor villager and\r\nthe toiling farmer.\r\n\r\nNewspapers charged Jay with saying that \"there ought to be in America\r\nonly two sorts of people, one very rich, the other very poor,\"[62] and\r\nto support the misrepresentation, they quoted his favourite maxim that\r\n\"those who own the country ought to govern it,\" pointing to the State\r\nConstitution which he drafted, to prove that only the well-to-do could\r\nvote. The Dutch, largely the slave holders of the State, accused him\r\nof wishing to rob them by the abolition of slavery. Dressed in other\r\nrhetorical clothes, these stories did service again in 1795 and 1798.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: George Pellew, _Life of John Jay_, p. 275.]\r\n\r\nBut the assumption of state debts, and Hamilton's financial system,\r\nbecame the fiercest objects of attack. To them were traced the \"reign\r\nof speculators\" that flowered in the year 1791. \"Bank bubbles,\r\ntontines, lotteries, monopolies, usury, gambling and swindling\r\nabound,\" said the New York _Journal_; \"poverty in the country, luxury\r\nin the capitals, corruption and usurpation in the national councils.\"\r\nHamilton's system had given the deepest stab to the hopes of the\r\nanti-Federalists, since it taught people to look to the Union rather\r\nthan to the State. Internal taxes and import duties were paid to the\r\nUnited States; coin was minted by the United States; paper money\r\nissued by the United States; letters carried and delivered by the\r\nUnited States; and state debts assumed by the United States. All this\r\nhad a tendency to break state attachments and state importance; and in\r\nstriking back, Republican orators branded the reports of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury as \"dangerous to liberty,\" the assumption of debts as\r\n\"a clever device for enslaving the people,\" and the whole fiscal\r\nsystem \"a dishonest scheme.\" The failure and imprisonment of William\r\nDuer, until recently Hamilton's trusted assistant, followed by riots\r\nin New York City, gave colour to the charge, and, although the most\r\nbitter opponents of the great Federalist in no wise connected him with\r\nany corrupt transaction, yet in the spring of 1792 Hamilton, the\r\nfriend and backer of Jay, was the most roundly abused man in the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists resented misrepresentation with misrepresentation.\r\nClinton's use of patronage, his opposition to the Federal\r\nConstitution, and the impropriety of having a military governor in\r\ntime of peace, objections left over from 1789, still figured as set\r\npieces in rhetorical fireworks; but the great red light, burned at\r\nevery meeting throughout the State, exposed Governor Clinton as\r\nsecretly profiting by the sale of public lands. The Legislature of\r\n1791 authorised the five state officers, acting as Commissioners of\r\nthe Land Office, to sell unappropriated lands in such parcels and on\r\nsuch terms as they deemed expedient, and under this power 5,542,173\r\nacres returned $1,030,433. Some of the land brought three shillings\r\nper acre, some two shillings six pence, some one shilling, but\r\nAlexander McComb picked up 3,635,200 acres at eight pence. McComb was\r\na friend of Clinton. More than that, he was a real estate dealer and\r\nspeculator. In the legislative investigation that followed,\r\nresolutions condemning the commissioners' conduct tangled up Clinton\r\nin a division of the profits, and sent McComb to jail. This was a\r\nsweet morsel for the Federalists. It mattered not that the Governor\r\ndenied it; that McComb contradicted it; that no proof supported it; or\r\nthat the Assembly acquitted him by a party vote of thirty-five to\r\ntwenty; the story did effective campaign service, and lived to torture\r\nAaron Burr, one of the commissioners, ten years afterward. Burr tried\r\nto escape responsibility by pleading absence when the contracts were\r\nmade; but the question never ceased coming up--if absence included all\r\nthe months of McComb's negotiations, what time did the Attorney-General\r\ngive to public business?\r\n\r\nIt was a deep grief to Jay that the Livingstons opposed him. The\r\nChancellor and Edward were his wife's cousins, Brockholst her brother.\r\nBrockholst had been Jay's private secretary at the embassy in Madrid,\r\nbut now, to use a famous expression of that day, \"the young man's head\r\nwas on fire,\" and violence characterised his political feelings and\r\nconduct. Satirical letters falsely attributed to Jay fanned the sparks\r\nof the Livingston opposition into a bright blaze, and, although the\r\nChief Justice denied the insinuation, the Chancellor gave battle with\r\nthe enthusiasm of a new convert.\r\n\r\nAs one glances through the list of workers in the campaign of 1792, he\r\nis reminded that the juniors or beginners soon came to occupy higher\r\nand more influential positions than some of their elders and leaders.\r\nDeWitt Clinton, for instance, not yet in office, was soon to be in the\r\nAssembly, in the State Senate, and in the United States Senate--a\r\ngreater force than any man of his time in New York, save Hamilton.\r\nJames Kent had just entered the Assembly. As a student in Egbert\r\nBenson's office, his remarkable industry impressed clients and\r\nteacher, but when his voice sounded the praises of John Jay, few could\r\nhave anticipated that this young man, small in stature, vivacious in\r\nspeech, quick in action, with dark eyes and a swarthy complexion, was\r\ndestined to become one of the most famous jurists in a century.\r\nAmbrose Spencer had not yet scored his first political honour, but his\r\nherculean frame and stately presence, with eyes and complexion darker\r\nthan Kent's, are to be seen leading in every political contest for\r\nmore than forty years.\r\n\r\nThere were also Smith Thompson, taught in the law by Chancellor Kent\r\nand tutored in politics by George Clinton, who was to follow the\r\nformer Chief Justice and end his days on the United States Supreme\r\nbench; Joseph C. Yates, founder of Union College, and Samuel L.\r\nMitchill, scientist and politician, who has been called the Franklin\r\nof New York. Younger than these, but equally alert, was Cadwallader A.\r\nColden, grandson of the royal lieutenant-governor of Stamp Act days.\r\nHe was now only twenty-two, just beginning at the bar, but destined to\r\nbe the intimate friend of Robert Fulton, a famous leader of a famous\r\nbar, and a political chieftain of a distinguished career.[63]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Interested in this exciting campaign was yet a younger\r\ngeneration, who soon contested their right-of-way to political\r\nleadership. Erastus Root was a junior at Dartmouth; Daniel D. Tompkins\r\nhad just entered Columbia; Martin Van Buren was in a country school on\r\nthe farm at Kinderhook; John Treat Irving was playing on the banks of\r\nthe river to be made famous by his younger brother; and William W. Van\r\nNess, the rarest genius of them all, and his younger cousin, William\r\nP. Van Ness, were listening to the voices that would soon summon them,\r\none in support of the brilliant Federalist leader, the other as a\r\nsecond to Aaron Burr in the great tragedy at Weehawken on the 11th of\r\nJuly, 1804.]\r\n\r\nAt the election, the people gave Jay a majority of their votes; but at\r\nthe count, a majority of the state canvassers gave Clinton the\r\ngovernorship. This was the first vicious party precedent established\r\nin the Empire State. It has had many successors at the polls, in the\r\nLegislature, and at the primaries, but none bolder and more harmful,\r\nor ruder and more outrageously wrong. Under the law, inspectors of\r\nelection sealed the ballots, delivered them to the sheriff or his\r\ndeputy, who conveyed them to the secretary of state. In Otsego County,\r\nRichard R. Smith's term as sheriff had expired, and the new sheriff\r\nhad not yet qualified, but Smith delivered the ballots to a person\r\nspecially deputised by him. Tioga's sheriff turned the ballots over\r\nto his deputy, who, being taken ill on the journey, handed them to a\r\nclerk for transmission. In Clinton the sheriff gave the votes to a man\r\nwithout deputation. No ballots were missing, no seals were broken, nor\r\nhad their delivery been delayed for a moment. But as soon as it became\r\nknown that these counties gave Jay a majority of about four hundred,\r\nquite enough to elect him, it was claimed that the votes had not been\r\nconveyed to the secretary of state by persons authorised to do so\r\nunder the law, and the canvassers, voting as their party preferences\r\ndictated, ruled out the returns by a vote of seven to four in\r\nClinton's favour. The discussion preceding this action, however, was\r\nso acrimonious and the alleged violation of law so technical, that the\r\nboard agreed to refer the controversy to Rufus King and Aaron Burr,\r\nthe United States senators.\r\n\r\nBurr had many an uneasy hour. He preferred to avoid the\r\nresponsibility, since an opinion might jeopardise his political\r\ninterests. If he found for Clinton, his Federalist friends would take\r\noffence; if he antagonised Clinton, the anti-Federalists would cast\r\nhim out. Thus far it had been his policy to keep in the background,\r\ndirecting others to act for him; now he must come out into the open.\r\nHe temporised, delayed, sought suggestions of friends, and endeavoured\r\nto induce his colleague to join him in declining to act as a referee,\r\nbut King saw no reason for avoiding an opinion, and in answering the\r\nquestion of the canvassers, he took the broad ground that an election\r\nlaw should be construed in furtherance of the right of suffrage. The\r\nact was for the protection of voters whose rights could not be\r\njeopardised by the negligence or misconduct of an agent charged with\r\nthe delivery of the ballots, nor by canvassers charged with their\r\ncounting. It was preposterous to suppose that the sudden illness of a\r\ndeputy, or the failure of an official to qualify, could disfranchise\r\nthe voters of a whole county. If it were otherwise, then the foolish\r\nor intentional misconduct of a sheriff might at any time overturn the\r\nwill of a majority. There was no pretence of wrong-doing. The ballots\r\nhad been counted, sealed, and delivered to the secretary of state no\r\nless faithfully than if there had been a technical adherence to the\r\nstrict letter of the law. He favoured canvassing Tioga's vote,\r\ntherefore, although it was doubtful if a deputy sheriff could deputise\r\na deputy, while the vote of Clinton should be canvassed because a\r\nsheriff may deputise by parol. As to Otsego, on which the election\r\nreally turned, King held that Smith was sheriff until a successor\r\nqualified, if not in law, then in fact; and though such acts of a _de\r\nfacto_ officer as are voluntarily and exclusively beneficial to\r\nhimself are void, those are valid that tend to the public utility.\r\n\r\nBurr was uninfluenced by respect for suffrage. Being statutory law, it\r\nmust be construed literally, not in spirit, or because of other rights\r\ninvolved. He agreed with his colleague as to the law governing the\r\nClinton case; but following the letter of the act, he held that\r\nTioga's votes ought not to be counted, since a deputy could not\r\nappoint a deputy. The Otsego ballots were also rejected because the\r\nright of a sheriff to hold over did not exist at common law; and as\r\nthe New York statute did not authorise it, Smith's duties ceased at\r\nthe end of his term; nor could he be an officer _de facto_, since he\r\nhad accepted and exercised for one day the office of supervisor, which\r\nwas incompatible with that of sheriff. In other words, Burr reduced\r\nthe question of Jay's election to Smith's right to act, and to avoid\r\nthe _de facto_ right, so ably presented by Senator King, he relied\r\nupon Smith's service of a day as supervisor before receiving and\r\nforwarding the ballots, notwithstanding sheriffs invariably held over\r\nuntil their successors qualified. Seven of such cases had occurred in\r\nfifteen years, and never before had the right been seriously\r\nquestioned. In one instance a hold-over sheriff had executed a\r\ncriminal. When urged to appoint a sheriff for Otsego earlier in the\r\nyear, Governor Clinton excused his delay because the old one could\r\nhold over.\r\n\r\nAfter this decision, only Clinton himself could avert the judgment\r\ncertain to be rendered by a partisan board. Nevertheless, the Governor\r\nremained silent. Thus, by a strict party vote of seven to four, the\r\ncanvassers, omitting the three counties with four hundred majority in\r\nJay's favour, returned 8,440 votes for Clinton and 8,332 for Jay.\r\nThen, to destroy all evidence of their shame, the ballots were burned,\r\nalthough the custom obtained of preserving them in the office of the\r\nsecretary of state.[64]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: A few days after Clinton's inauguration Burr wrote a\r\nFederalist friend: \"I earnestly wished and sought to be relieved from\r\nthe necessity of giving any opinion, particularly as it would be\r\ndisagreeable to you and a few others whom I respect and wish always to\r\ngratify; but the conduct of Mr. King left me no alternative. I was\r\nobliged to give an opinion.... It would, indeed, be the extreme of\r\nweakness in me to expect friendship from Mr. Clinton. I have too many\r\nreasons to believe that he regards me with jealousy and\r\nmalevolence.... Some pretend, but none can believe, that I am\r\nprejudiced in his favour. I have not even seen or spoken to him since\r\nJanuary last.\" This letter had scarcely been delivered when Clinton\r\nappointed him to the Supreme Court, an office which Burr declined,\r\npreferring to remain in the Senate.]\r\n\r\nNews travelled slowly in those days. There were no telegrams, no\r\nreporters, no regular correspondents, no special editions to tell the\r\nmorning reader what had happened the day before; but when it once\r\nbecame known that John Jay had been counted out, the people of the\r\nState were aroused to the wildest passion of rage, recalling the\r\nfamous Tilden-Hayes controversy three-quarters of a century later. A\r\nreturning board, it was claimed, had overturned the will of the\r\npeople; and to the superheated excitement of the campaign, was added\r\nthe fierce anger of an outraged party. Wild menaces were uttered, and\r\nthe citizens of Otsego threatened an appeal to arms. \"People are\r\nrunning in continually,\" wrote Mrs. Jay to her husband, \"to vent their\r\nvexation. Senator King says he thinks Clinton as lawfully governor of\r\nConnecticut as of New York, but he knows of no redress.\"[65] Hamilton\r\nagreed with King, and counselled peaceful submission.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: _Jay MSS._]\r\n\r\nMeantime the Chief Justice was returning home from Vermont by way of\r\nAlbany. At Lansingburgh the people met him, and from thence to New\r\nYork public addresses and public dinners were followed with the roar\r\nof artillery and the shouts of the populace. \"Though abuse of power\r\nmay for a time deprive you and the citizens of their right,\" said one\r\ncommittee, \"we trust the sacred flame of liberty is not so far\r\nextinguished in the bosoms of Americans as tamely to submit to the\r\nshackles of slavery, without at least a struggle to shake them\r\noff.\"[66] Citizens of New York met him eight miles from the city, and\r\nupon his arrival, \"the friends of liberty\" condemned the men who would\r\ndeprive him of the high office \"in contempt of the sacred voice of the\r\npeople, in defiance of the Constitution, and in violation of the\r\nuniform practice and settled principles of law.\"[67]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 290.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Ibid._, p. 292.]\r\n\r\nDuring these days of excitement, Jay conducted himself with remarkable\r\nforbearance and dignity. It was the poise of Washington. \"The\r\nreflection that the majority of electors were for me is a pleasing\r\none,\" he wrote his wife; \"that injustice has taken place does not\r\nsurprise me, and I hope will not affect you very sensibly. The\r\nintelligence found me perfectly prepared for it. A few years more will\r\nput us all in the dust, and it will then be of more importance to me\r\nto have governed myself than to have governed the State.\"[68] This\r\nthought influenced his conduct throughout. When armed resistance\r\nseemed inevitable, he raised his voice in opposition to all feeling.\r\n\"Every consideration of propriety forbids that difference in opinion\r\nrespecting candidates should suspend or interrupt that natural good\r\nhumour which harmonises society, and softens the asperities incident\r\nto human life and human affairs.\"[69] At a large dinner on the 4th of\r\nJuly, Jay gave the toast: \"May the people always respect themselves,\r\nand remember what they owe to posterity;\" but after he had retired,\r\nthe banqueters let loose their tongues, drinking to \"John Jay,\r\nGovernor by voice of the people,\" and to \"the Governor (of right) of\r\nthe State of New York.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: _Ibid._, p. 289.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: _Ibid._, p. 293.]\r\n\r\nClinton entered upon his sixth term as governor amidst vituperation\r\nand obloquy. He was known as the \"Usurper,\" and in order to reduce him\r\nto a mere figurehead, the Federalists who controlled the Assembly, led\r\nby Josiah Ogden Hoffman, the brilliant New York lawyer, now proposed\r\nto choose a new Council of Appointment, although the term of the old\r\nCouncil had not yet expired. The Constitution provided that the\r\nCouncil should hold office one year, and that the Governor, with the\r\nadvice of the Council, should appoint to office. Up to this time such\r\nhad been the accepted practice. Nevertheless, the Federalists, having\r\na majority of the Assembly, forced the election of a Council made up\r\nentirely of members of their own party, headed by Philip Schuyler, the\r\nveteran legislator and soldier, and then proceeded to nominate and\r\nconfirm Egbert Benson as a judge of the Supreme Court. Clinton, as\r\ngovernor and a member of the Council, refused to nominate Benson,\r\ninsisting that the exclusive right of nomination was vested in him.\r\nHere the matter should have ended under the Constitution as Jay\r\ninterpreted it; but Schuyler held otherwise, claiming that the Council\r\nhad a concurrent right to nominate. He went further, and decided that\r\nwhenever the law omitted to limit the number of officers, the Council\r\nmight do it, and whenever an officer must be commissioned annually,\r\nanother might be put in his place at the expiration of his commission.\r\nThis would give the Council power to increase at will the number of\r\nofficials not otherwise limited by law, and to displace every\r\nanti-Federalist at the expiration of his commission.\r\n\r\nClinton argued that the governor, being charged under the Constitution\r\nwith the execution of the laws, was vested with exclusive discretion\r\nas to the number of officers necessary to their execution, whereas, if\r\nleft to one not responsible for such execution, too many or too few\r\nofficials might be created. With respect to the continuation of an\r\nincumbent in office at the pleasure of the Council, \"the Constitution\r\ndid not intend,\" he said, \"a capricious, arbitrary pleasure, but a\r\nsound discretion to be exercised for the promotion of the public good;\r\nthat a contrary practice would deprive men of their offices because\r\nthey have too much independence of spirit to support measures they\r\nsuppose injurious to the community, and might induce others from undue\r\nattachment to office to sacrifice their integrity to improper\r\nconsiderations.\"[70] This was good reasoning and good prophecy; but\r\nhis protests fell upon ears as deaf to a wise policy as did the\r\nprotests of Jay's friends when the board of canvassers counted Jay out\r\nand Clinton in.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n1, p. 84.]\r\n\r\nThe action of the Council of Appointment was a stunning blow to\r\nClinton. Under Jay's constitution, every officer in city, county, and\r\nState, civil and military, save governor, lieutenant-governor, members\r\nof the Legislature, and aldermen, could now be appointed by the\r\nCouncil regardless of the Governor; and already these appointments\r\nmounted up into hundreds. In 1821 they numbered over fifteen thousand.\r\nThus, as if by magic, the Council was turned into a political machine.\r\nUnder this arrangement, a party only needed a majority of the Assembly\r\nto elect a Council which made all appointments, and the control of\r\nappointments was sufficient to elect a majority of the Assembly. Thus\r\nit was an endless chain the moment the Council became a political\r\nmachine, and it became a political machine the moment Philip Schuyler\r\nheaded the Council of 1793.\r\n\r\nThis arbitrary proceeding led to twenty years of corrupt methods and\r\npolitical scandals. Schuyler's justification was probably the\r\nconviction that poetic justice required that Clinton, having become\r\ngovernor without right, should have his powers reduced to their lowest\r\nterms; but whatever the motive, his action was indefensible, and his\r\nreply that the Governor's practices did not correspond to his precepts\r\nfell for want of proof. Clinton had then been in office seventeen\r\nyears, and, although he took good care to select members of his own\r\nparty, only one case, and that a doubtful one, could be cited in\r\nsupport of the charge that appointments had been made solely for\r\npolitical purposes.\r\n\r\nIn a published address, on January 22, 1795, Governor Clinton declined\r\nto stand for re-election in the following April because of ill health\r\nand neglected private affairs. Included in this letter was the\r\nsomewhat apocryphal statement that he withdrew from an office never\r\nsolicited, which he had accepted with diffidence, and from which he\r\nshould retire with pleasure. The reader who has followed the story of\r\nhis career through the campaigns of 1789 and 1792 will scarcely\r\nbelieve him serious in this declaration, although he undoubtedly\r\nretired with pleasure. At the time of his withdrawal, he had an attack\r\nof inflammatory rheumatism, but he was neither a sick man nor an old\r\none, being then in his fifty-fifth year, with twelve years of\r\nhonourable public life still before him. It is likely the reason in\r\nthe old rhyme, \"He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another\r\nday,\" had more to do with his retirement than shattered health and\r\ncrippled fortune. Defeat has never been regarded helpful to future\r\npolitical preferment, and this shrewd reader of the signs of the\r\ntimes, his ambition already fixed on higher honours and more exalted\r\nplace, saw the coming political change in New York as clearly and\r\nunmistakably as an approaching storm announced itself in an increase\r\nof his rheumatic aches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION OF EARNEST MEN\r\n\r\n1795-1800\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Clinton out of the race for governor in 1795, his party's\r\nweakness discovered itself in the selection of Chief Justice Robert\r\nYates, Hamilton's coalition candidate in 1789. It was a makeshift\r\nnomination, since none cared to run after Clinton's declination\r\nsounded a note of defeat. Yates' passion for office led him into\r\nstrange blunders. He seemed willing to become the candidate of any\r\nparty, under any conditions, at any time, if only he could step into\r\nthe official shoes of George Clinton. He was excusable in 1789,\r\nperhaps, when the way opened up a fair chance of success, but in 1795\r\nhis ambition subjected him to ridicule as well as to humiliation. It\r\nwas said derisively that he was defeated, although every freeholder in\r\nthe State had voted for him.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists were far from unanimous in their choice of John Jay.\r\nHe had not yet returned from England, whither Washington had sent him\r\nin the preceding year to negotiate a treaty to recover, among other\r\nthings, compensation for negroes who followed English troops across\r\nthe Atlantic at the close of the war; to obtain a surrender of the\r\nWestern military posts not yet evacuated; and to secure an article\r\nagainst impressments. It was believed that a storm of disapproval\r\nwould greet his work, and the timid ones seriously questioned the\r\nexpediency of his nomination. The submission of the treaty had already\r\nprecipitated a crisis in the United States Senate, and while it might\r\nnot be ratified and officially promulgated before election, grave\r\ndanger existed of its clandestine publication by the press. Hamilton,\r\nhowever, insisted, and Jay became the nominee. \"It had been so decreed\r\nfrom the beginning,\" wrote Egbert Benson.\r\n\r\nThe campaign that followed was featureless. Chief Justice Yates\r\naroused no interest, and Chief Justice Jay was in England. From the\r\noutset, Jay's election was conceded; and a canvass of the votes showed\r\nthat he had swept the State by a large majority. In 1789 Clinton\r\nreceived a majority of 489; in 1792 the canvassers gave him 108; but\r\nin 1795 Jay had 1589.[71]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: John Jay, 13,481; Robert Yates, 11,892. _Civil List,\r\nState of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nWhat would have happened had the treaty been published before\r\nelection, fills one with interested conjecture. Its disclosure on July\r\n2, the day after Jay's inauguration, turned the applause of that\r\njoyous occasion into the most exasperating abuse. Such a sudden and\r\ntempestuous change in the popularity of a public official is\r\nunprecedented in the history of American politics. In a night the\r\nwhole State was thrown into a ferment of intense excitement, the storm\r\nof vituperation seeming to centre in New York city. Jay was burned in\r\neffigy; Hamilton was struck in the face with a stone while defending\r\nJay's work; a copy of the treaty was burned before the house of the\r\nBritish Minister; riot and mob violence held carnival everywhere.\r\nParty spirit never before, and never since, perhaps, ran so high. One\r\neffigy represented Jay as saying, while supporting a pair of scales,\r\nwith the treaty on one side and a bag of gold on the other, \"Come up\r\nto my price, and I will sell you my country.\" Chalked in large white\r\nletters on one of the principal streets in New York, appeared these\r\nwords: \"Damn John Jay! Damn every one that won't damn John Jay!! Damn\r\nevery one that won't put lights in his windows and sit up all night\r\ndamning John Jay!!!\"[72] This revulsion of public sentiment was not\r\nexactly a tempest in a teapot, but it proved a storm of limited\r\nduration, the elections in the spring of 1796 showing decided\r\nlegislative gains for the Federalists.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: John Jay, _Second Letter on Dawson's Federalist_, N.Y.,\r\n1864, p. 19.]\r\n\r\nHamilton divined the cause of the trouble. \"There are three persons,\"\r\nhe wrote,[73] \"prominent in the public eye as the successor of the\r\nPresident--Mr. Adams, Mr. Jay, and Mr. Jefferson.... Mr. Jay has been\r\nrepeatedly the object of attacks with the same view. His friends, as\r\nwell as his enemies, anticipated that he could make no treaty which\r\nwould not furnish weapons against him; and it were to have been\r\nignorant of the indefatigable malice of his adversaries to have\r\ndoubted that they would be seized with eagerness and wielded with\r\ndexterity. The peculiar circumstances which have attended the two last\r\nelections for governor of this State have been of a nature to give the\r\nutmost keenness to party animosity. It was impossible that Mr. Jay\r\nshould be forgiven for his double, and, in the last instance,\r\ntriumphant success; or that any promising opportunity of detaching\r\nfrom him the public confidence, should pass unimproved.... Trivial\r\nfacts frequently throw light upon important designs. It is remarkable\r\nthat in the toasts given on July 4, 1795, whenever there appears a\r\ndirect or indirect censure of the treaty, it is pretty uniformly\r\ncoupled with compliments to Mr. Jefferson, and to our late governor,\r\nMr. Clinton, with an evident design to place those gentlemen in\r\ncontrast to Mr. Jay, and, decrying him, to elevate them. No one can be\r\nblind to the finger of party spirit, visible in these and similar\r\ntransactions. It indicates to us clearly one powerful source of\r\nopposition to the treaty.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Hamilton's _Camillus_, July 23, 1795, _Works_, Vol. 4,\r\np. 371.]\r\n\r\nThe treaty was undoubtedly a disappointment to the country, and not\r\ngreatly pleasing to Washington. Perhaps Jay said the best thing that\r\ncould be said in its favour: \"One more favourable was not attainable.\"\r\nThe thing he was sent especially to do, he failed to accomplish,\r\nexcept the evacuation of the posts, and a concession as to the West\r\nIndian trade, which the Senate rejected. Nevertheless the country was\r\ngreatly and permanently benefited. The treaty acquired extradition\r\nfor criminals; it secured the collection of debts barred by the\r\nRevolution, amounting to ten million dollars; it established the\r\nprinciple that war should not again be a pretext for the confiscation\r\nof debts or for the annulment of contracts between individuals; and it\r\navoided a war with England, for which the United States was never more\r\nunprepared. \"As the first treaty negotiated under the new government,\"\r\nsays John W. Foster, \"it marked a distinct advance in international\r\npractice.\"[74] In a recent biography of Andrew Jackson, Professor\r\nSumner says: \"Jay's treaty was a masterpiece of diplomacy, considering\r\nthe times and the circumstances of this country.\" Even the\r\nmuch-criticised commercial clause, \"the entering wedge,\" as Jay called\r\nit, proved such a gain to America, that upon the breaking out of war\r\nin 1812, Lord Sheffield declared that England had \"now a complete\r\nopportunity of getting rid of that most impolitic treaty of 1794, when\r\nLord Grenville was so perfectly duped by Jay.\"[75]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: _A Century of American Diplomacy_, p. 165.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: To Mr. Abbott, November 6, 1812, _Correspondence of Lord\r\nColchester_, Vol. 2, p. 409.]\r\n\r\nJohn Jay's first term as governor was characteristically cautious and\r\nconservative. He began with observing the proprieties, gracefully\r\ndeclining the French Consul's invitation to a republican\r\nentertainment, and courageously remaining at his post during the\r\nyellow fever epidemic of 1795. With equal ease he settled the growing\r\nconflict between the severity of the past and the sympathy of the\r\npresent, by changing the punishment in cases of ordinary felony, from\r\ndeath to imprisonment. Up to that time men might have been executed\r\nfor stealing a few loaves of high-priced bread to relieve the\r\nsufferings of a hungry family. Under Jay's humane plea for mercy the\r\ndeath penalty was limited to treason, murder, and stealing from a\r\nchurch. A quarter of a century passed before Sir James Mackintosh\r\nsucceeded in carrying a similar measure through the British\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn his first message Jay recommended neither the abolition of\r\nslavery, nor the discontinuance of official changes for political\r\nreasons, \"since the best and most virtuous men,\" he said, \"must, in\r\nthe distribution of patronage, yield to the influence of party\r\nconsiderations.\" As the only important questions before him just then\r\ninvolved the freedom of slaves and reform in the civil service, his\r\nsilence as to the one and his declaration as to the other were\r\ncertainly sufficient to allay any suspicion that he was to become a\r\nradical reformer. He did recommend a legislative interpretation of the\r\nConstitution relating to the governor's exclusive right to nominate to\r\noffice; but in the blandest and most complimentary words, the\r\nLegislature invited the Governor to let well enough alone. \"The\r\nevidence of ability, integrity and patriotism,\" so the answer ran,\r\n\"which has been invariably afforded by your conduct in the discharge\r\nof the variety of arduous and important trusts, authorise us to\r\nanticipate an administration conducive to the welfare of your\r\nconstituents.\" This amiable answer betrayed the deft hand of Ambrose\r\nSpencer, who, to make it sweeter and more acceptable, moved the\r\ninsertion of the word \"invariably.\"[76] Thus ended the suggestion of a\r\nlaw that might have undone the mischief of Schuyler, and prevented the\r\nscandal and corrupt methods that obtained during the next two decades.\r\nAt least, this is the thought of a later century, when civil service\r\nreform has sunk a tap-root into American soil, still frosty, perhaps,\r\nyet not wholly congealed as it seems to have been one hundred years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n1, p. 97.]\r\n\r\nJay's administration might be called the reward days of earnest, able\r\nmen, whose meritorious service became their passport to office. Upon\r\nthe retirement in 1798 of Robert Yates and John Sloss Hobart from the\r\nSupreme bench, he appointed James Kent and Jacob Radcliff. If Jay had\r\nnever done anything else, the appointment of Kent would immortalise\r\nhim, just as the selection of John Marshall placed a halo about the\r\nhead of President Adams. Kent, now thirty-five years old, a great\r\nlawyer and a strong partisan, had the conservatism of Jay, and held\r\nto the principles of Hamilton. He was making brilliant way in\r\npolitics, showing himself an administrator, a debater, and a leader of\r\nconsummate ability; but he steadily refused to withdraw from the\r\nprofessional path along which he was to move with such distinction.\r\nUntil Kent's appearance, the administration of the law had been\r\ninefficient and unsatisfactory. Men of ability had occupied the bench;\r\nbut the laborious and business methods which subsequently gave\r\nstrength and character to the court, had not been applied. The custom\r\nof writing opinions in the most important cases did not then obtain,\r\nwhile the principles and foundation of the law were seldom explored.\r\nBut Kent began at once, after a most laborious examination of the\r\ncases and the law, to bring the written opinions which enrich the\r\nreports of Caines and Johnson, to the consultations of the judges,\r\nthus setting an example to his associates, and opening the way for\r\nthat admirable and orderly system of jurisprudence that has adorned\r\nthe judiciary of New York for more than a century. The men of the\r\nolder school had had their day. The court of Hobart was closed; the\r\nage of Kent had opened.\r\n\r\nRadcliff, the other judicial appointee, was not a new name in 1798;\r\nbut it was destined to become dearer to every lover of a chancery\r\nlawyer. He had a natural gift for chancery, and no natural inclination\r\nwhatever for politics or the bench. So, after serving a single term in\r\nthe Assembly, two years as an assistant attorney-general, and six\r\nyears on the Supreme Court, he returned to the practice, to which he\r\ndevoted the remaining forty years of his life, save when holding the\r\noffice of mayor of New York in 1810, and again in 1815 during the\r\nbrief retirement of DeWitt Clinton. Wherever he appeared, Radcliff's\r\nerect, dignified bearing and remarkably handsome face, illuminated\r\nwith large eyes and a highly intellectual expression, marked him as a\r\nman of distinction. He set the custom of dictating bills in chancery\r\nto an amanuensis, doing it with such accuracy that a word had seldom\r\nto be changed. Of the same age as Kent, he must have been of great\r\nhelp to that distinguished jurist, had he continued with the court.\r\nWhile hovering somewhat uncertain between the bench and the bar, he\r\nremoved to New York City, where the opportunities for one of his gifts\r\nsoon settled the question.\r\n\r\nOther appointments of Jay were equally satisfactory. The\r\ncomptrollership of state, recently created, went to Samuel Jones in\r\nreturn for having patiently worked out this more perfect method of\r\ncontrolling and disbursing state funds. Ambrose Spencer became an\r\nassistant attorney-general, and the appointment of Rufus King as\r\nminister to England made room for the election of John Lawrence to the\r\nUnited States Senate. Lawrence had little claim, perhaps, to be\r\nentered in the class with Rufus King, since he was neither leader nor\r\nstatesman; but he had been the faithful adjutant-general of\r\nWashington, and a steady, fearless supporter of Hamilton. Lawrence, an\r\nEnglishman by birth, had settled in New York at an early period in\r\nlife, and by his marriage to the daughter of Alexander McDougall,\r\nquickly came into conspicuous sympathy with the radical wing of the\r\npatriotic party. He will always be remembered in history as\r\njudge-advocate of the court that tried Major André. He held office\r\nalmost continuously from 1775 until his death in 1810, serving eight\r\nyears in the army, one in the State Senate, six in Congress, four as\r\njudge of the United States District Court, and four as a United States\r\nsenator, closing his honourable career as president pro tem. of that\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nAs a rebuke to Aaron Burr's snap game so successfully played in 1791,\r\nPhilip Schuyler succeeded him in the United States Senate in 1797, an\r\nevent that must have sweetened the closing years of the Revolutionary\r\nveteran. But Schuyler was now a sick man, and in January, 1798, he\r\nresigned the senatorial toga to others, upon whose shoulders it rested\r\nbriefly, and possibly with less ease and grace. John Sloss Hobart wore\r\nit for three months. After him, for ten months, came William North,\r\nfollowed by James Watson, who, in turn, resigned in March, 1800. Thus,\r\nin the short period of thirty-six months, four men tasted the sweets\r\nof the exalted position so brilliantly filled by the erratic grandson\r\nof Jonathan Edwards. North and Watson were men of certain ability and\r\ncertain gifts. Both had been soldiers. North had followed Arnold to\r\nQuebec, had charged with his regiment at Monmouth, had served with\r\ncredit upon Baron Steuben's staff,[77] and had acquitted himself with\r\nhonour at Yorktown. He belonged to that coterie of brilliant young\r\nmen, noted for bravery and endurance, who quickly found favour with\r\nthe fighting generals of the Revolution. Watson resigned his captaincy\r\nin 1777, and engaged successfully in mercantile pursuits, subsequently\r\nentering the Assembly with North, the former becoming speaker in 1794\r\nand the latter in 1795 and 1796. At the time of North's election to\r\nthe United States Senate, Watson was a member of the State Senate.\r\nLike Lawrence, both were perfervid Federalists, zealous champions of\r\nHamilton, and profound believers in the wisdom of minimising, if not\r\nabrogating, the rights of States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: At twenty-two years of age, while witnessing the\r\ndisgraceful rout of General Lee at Monmouth, North attracted the\r\nattention of Steuben, whose tactics and discipline the young officer\r\nsubsequently introduced throughout the Continental army. The\r\ncordiality existing between the earnest aide and the brave Prussian,\r\nso dear to his friends, so formidable to his enemies, ripened into an\r\naffectionate regard that recalls the relation between Washington and\r\nHamilton. After the war, with an annuity of twenty-five hundred\r\ndollars and sixteen thousand acres of land in Oneida County, the gift\r\nof New York, Steuben built a log house, withdrew from society, and\r\nplayed at farming, until in 1794 his remains were borne to the spot,\r\nnot far from Trenton Falls, where stands the monument that bears his\r\nname. The faithful North visited and cared for him to the end, and\r\nunder the terms of the will parcelled out the great estate among his\r\ntenants and old staff officers.]\r\n\r\nWatson's resignation from the United States Senate enabled the\r\nFederalists to elect Gouverneur Morris just before the political\r\nchange in 1800 swept them from power. Morris was a fit successor to\r\nSchuyler. His family had belonged to the State for a century and a\r\nhalf. The name stood for tradition and conservatism--an embodiment of\r\nthe past amid the changes of revolution. His home near Harlaem, an\r\nestate of three thousand acres, with a prospect of intermingled\r\nislands and water, stretching to the Sound, which had been purchased\r\nby a great-grandfather in the middle of the preceding century,\r\nreflected the substantial character of its founder, a distinguished\r\nofficer in Cromwell's army.\r\n\r\nGouverneur was the child of his father's second marriage. The\r\nfamily,[78] especially the older children, of whom Richard, chief\r\njustice of the State, was the third and youngest boy, resented the\r\nunion, making Gouverneur's position resemble that of Joseph among his\r\nbrethren. Twenty-two years intervened between him and Richard. Before\r\nthe former left the schoolroom, the latter had succeeded his father as\r\njudge of the vice-admiralty; but as for being of any assistance to the\r\nfatherless lad Richard might as well have been vice-admiral of the\r\nblue, sailing the seas. There would be something pathetic in this\r\nestrangement, if independence and self-reliance had not dominated the\r\nyoungest son as well as the older heirs of this noble family. Lewis,\r\nthe eldest, served in the Continental Congress and became a signer of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, while Staats Long, the second son,\r\nwandered to England, married the Countess of Gordon, became a general\r\nin the British army, and a member of Parliament in the days of Lord\r\nNorth and Charles James Fox. It was a strange coincidence, one brother\r\nresisting Parliament in Congress, the other resisting Congress in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: There was a slight vein of eccentricity running through\r\nthe Morris family, with its occasional outcroppings accentuated in the\r\npresence of death. The grandfather, distinguished as chief justice of\r\nNew York and governor of New Jersey, forbade in his will the payment\r\nof any one for preaching his funeral sermon, but if a person\r\nvolunteered, he said, commending or blaming his conduct in life, his\r\nwords would be acceptable. Gouverneur's father desired no notice of\r\nhis dissolution in the newspapers, not even a simple announcement of\r\nhis death. \"My actions,\" he wrote, \"have been so inconsiderable in the\r\nworld, that the most durable monument will not perpetuate my folly\r\nwhile it lasts.\" It is evident that Gouverneur did not inherit from\r\nhim the almost bumptious self-confidence which was to mar more than\r\nhelp him. That inherent defect came from his mother, who gave him,\r\nalso, a brilliancy and versatility that other members of the family\r\ndid not share, making him more conspicuously active in high places\r\nduring the exciting days of the Revolution. Gouverneur Morris was a\r\nnational character; Richard and Lewis belonged exclusively to New\r\nYork.]\r\n\r\nThe influences surrounding Gouverneur's youth were decidedly Tory. His\r\nmother warmly adhered to George the Third; his professors at King's\r\ntaught loyalty to the Crown; his distinguished tutor in the law,\r\nWilliam Smith, New York's Tory historian, magnified the work and the\r\nstrength of Parliament; while his associates, always his mother's\r\nwelcomed guests at Morrisania, were British officers, who talked of\r\nWolfe and his glorious struggles for England. But there never was a\r\nmoment from the time Gouverneur Morris entered the Provincial Congress\r\nof New York on May 22, 1775, at the age of twenty-three, that he was\r\nnot conspicuously and brilliantly active in the cause of America.\r\nWhenever or wherever a Revolutionary body was organised, or for\r\nwhatever purpose, Congress, Convention, or Committee of Safety, he\r\nbecame a member of it. Six years younger than Jay, and six years older\r\nthan Hamilton, he seemed to complete that remarkable New York trio, so\r\nfertile in mental resources and so successful in achievement. He did\r\nnot, like Jay, outline a constitution, but he believed, with Jay, in\r\nbalancing wealth against numbers, and in contending for the protection\r\nof the rights of property against the spirit of democracy. It is\r\ninteresting to study these young men, so different in temperament, yet\r\nthinking alike and acting together for a quarter of a century--Jay,\r\ngentle and modest; Hamilton, impetuous and imperious; Morris,\r\nself-confident and conceited; but on all essential matters of state,\r\nstanding together like a tripod, firm and invincible. In his distrust\r\nof western influences, however, Morris was more conservative than Jay\r\nor Hamilton. He was broad and liberal toward the original thirteen\r\nStates, but he wanted to subordinate the balance of the country to\r\ntheir control. He regarded the people who might seek homes west of the\r\nAlleghanies with something of the suspicion Jay entertained for the\r\npropertyless citizens of New York. The day would come, he believed,\r\nwhen those untutored, backwoods settlers would outnumber their\r\nbrethren on the Atlantic coast, and he desired some provision in the\r\nConstitution which would permit the minority to rule such a majority.\r\nIf these views shrivelled his statesmanship, it may be said to his\r\ncredit that they discovered a prophetic gift most uncommon in those\r\ndays, giving him the power to see a great empire of people in the\r\nfertile valley of the Mississippi and its tributaries.[79] Fifteen\r\nyears later Robert R. Livingston expressed the belief that not in a\r\ncentury would a white man cross the Father of Waters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Gouverneur Morris seemed to find history-making places.\r\nWith Washington and Greene he opposed the Conway cabal; with Jay and\r\nLivingston he drafted the Constitution of the State; with Hamilton and\r\nMadison he stood for the Federal Constitution, the revision of its\r\nstyle being committed to his pen. Then Washington needed him, first in\r\nEngland, afterward as minister to France; and when Monroe relieved him\r\nin 1794 he travelled leisurely through Europe for four years, meeting\r\nits distinguished writers and statesmen, forming friendships with\r\nMadame De Staël and the Neckers, aiding and witnessing the release of\r\nLafayette from Olmutz prison, and finally assisting the young and\r\nmelancholy, but gentle and unassuming Duke of Orleans, afterward King\r\nof France, to find a temporary asylum in the United States. He\r\nreturned to America ten years after he had sailed from the Delaware\r\ncapes, just in time to be called to the United States Senate.]\r\n\r\nInto the life of Jay's peaceful administration came another\r\ninteresting character, the champion of every project known to the\r\ninventive genius of his day. We shall hear much of Samuel Latham\r\nMitchill during the next three decades. He was now thirty-five years\r\nold, a sort of universal eccentric genius, already known as\r\nphilosopher, scientist, teacher, and critic, a professor in Columbia,\r\nthe friend of Joseph Priestley, the author of scientific essays, and\r\nthe first in America to make mineralogical explorations. Perhaps if\r\nhe had worked in fewer fields he might have won greater renown, making\r\nhis name familiar to the general student of our own time; but he\r\nbelonged to an order of intellect far higher than most of his\r\nassociates, filling the books with his doings and sayings. Although\r\nhis influence, even among specialists, has probably faded now, he\r\ninspired the scientific thought of his time, and established societies\r\nwhich still exist, and whose history, up to the time of his death in\r\n1831, was largely his own. Mitchill belonged to the Republican party\r\nbecause it was the party of Jefferson, and he followed Jefferson\r\nbecause Jefferson was a philosopher. For the same reason he became the\r\npersonal friend of Chancellor Livingston, with whom, among other\r\nthings, he founded the Society for the Promotion of Agriculture,\r\nManufactures, and the Useful Arts. It was said of Mitchill that \"he\r\nwas equally at home in studying the geology of Niagara, or the anatomy\r\nof an egg; in offering suggestions as to the angle of a windmill, or\r\nthe shape of a gridiron; in deciphering a Babylonian brick, or in\r\nadvising how to apply steam to navigation.\"\r\n\r\nMitchill became a member of the Assembly in 1798, and it was his\r\ninterest in the experiments then being made of applying steam to\r\nnavigation, that led him to introduce a bill repealing the act of\r\n1787, giving John Fitch the sole right to use steamboats on the\r\nHudson, and granting the privilege to Chancellor Livingston for a term\r\nof twenty years, provided that within a year he should build a boat of\r\ntwenty tons capacity and propel it by steam at a speed of four miles\r\nan hour. John Fitch had disappeared, and with him his idea of applying\r\nsteam to paddles. He had fitted a steam engine of his own invention\r\ninto a ferry-boat of his own construction, and for a whole summer this\r\ncreation of an uneducated genius had been seen by the people of\r\nPhiladelphia moving steadily against wind and tide; but money gave\r\nout, the experiment was unsatisfactory, and Fitch wandered to the\r\nbanks of the Ohio, where opium helped him end his life in an obscure\r\nKentucky inn, while his steamboat rotted on the shores of the\r\nDelaware. Then John Stevens of Hoboken began a series of experiments\r\nin 1791, trying elliptical paddles, smoke-jack wheels, and other\r\ningenious contrivances, which soon found the oblivion of Fitch's\r\ninventions. Subsequently Rumsey, another ingenious American, sought\r\nwith no better success to drive a boat by expelling water from the\r\nstern. When it was announced that the great Chancellor also had a\r\nscheme, it is not surprising, perhaps, that the wags of the Assembly\r\nridiculed the project as idle and whimsical. \"Imagine a boat,\" said\r\none, \"trying to propel itself by squirting water through its stern.\"\r\nAnother spoke of it as \"an application of the skunk principle.\" Ezra\r\nL'Hommedieu, then a state senator, declared that Livingston's\r\n\"steamboat bill\" was a standing subject of ridicule throughout the\r\nentire session.\r\n\r\nBut there were others than legislators who made sport of these\r\napparently visionary projects to settle the value of steam as a\r\nlocomotive power. Benjamin H. Latrobe, the most eminent engineer in\r\nAmerica, did not hesitate to overwhelm such inventions with objections\r\nthat, in his opinion, could never be overcome. \"There are indeed\r\ngeneral objections to the use of the steam engine for impelling\r\nboats,\" he wrote, in 1803, \"from which no particular mode of\r\napplication can be free. These are, first, the weight of the engine\r\nand of the fuel; second, the large space it occupies; third, the\r\ntendency of its action to rack the vessel and render it leaky; fourth,\r\nthe expense of maintenance; fifth, the irregularity of its motion and\r\nthe motion of the water in the boiler and cistern, and of the\r\nfuel-vessel in rough water; sixth, the difficulty arising from the\r\nliability of the paddles or oars to break, if light, and from the\r\nweight, if made strong. Perhaps some of the objections against it may\r\nbe obviated. That founded on the expense and weight of the fuel may\r\nnot for some years exist in the Mississippi, where there is a\r\nredundance of wood on the banks; but the cutting and loading will be\r\nalmost as great an evil.\"[80]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Rep. to the Am. Philosophical Society, Phila., May,\r\n1803. Within four years the steamboat was running. Latrobe was\r\narchitect of the Capitol at Washington, which he also rebuilt after\r\nthe British burned it in 1814.]\r\n\r\nMitchill, however, would not be suppressed by the fun-making\r\nlegislators or the reasoning of a conservative engineer. \"I had to\r\nencounter all their jokes and the whole of their logic,\" he wrote a\r\nfriend. His bill finally became a law, and Livingston, with the help\r\nof the Doctor, placed a horizontal wheel in a well in the bottom and\r\ncentre of a boat, which propelled the water through an aperture in the\r\nstern. The small engine, however, having an eighteen-inch cylinder and\r\nthree feet stroke, could obtain a speed of only three miles an hour,\r\nand finding that the loss of power did not compensate for the\r\nencumbrance of external wheels and the action of the waves, which he\r\nhoped to escape, Livingston relinquished the plan. Four years later,\r\nhowever, the Chancellor's money and Robert Fulton's genius were to\r\nenrich the world with a discovery that has immortalised Fulton and\r\nplaced Livingston's name among the patrons of the greatest inventors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nOVERTHROW OF THE FEDERALISTS\r\n\r\n1798-1800\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to select a more popular or satisfactory\r\nadministration than was Jay's first three years as governor.\r\nOpposition growing out of his famous treaty had entirely subsided,\r\nsalutary changes in laws comforted the people, and with Hamilton's\r\nfinancial system, then thoroughly understood and appreciated, came\r\nunprecedented good times. To all appearances, therefore, Jay's\r\nre-election in 1798 seemed assured by an increased majority, and the\r\nannouncement that Chancellor Livingston was a voluntary rival proved\r\nsomething of a political shock.[81] For many years the relations\r\nbetween Jay and Livingston were intimate. They had been partners in\r\nthe law, associates in the Council of Revision, colleagues in\r\nCongress, co-workers in the formation of a state constitution, and\r\ncompanions in the Poughkeepsie convention. Jay had succeeded\r\nLivingston in 1784 as secretary of foreign affairs under the\r\nConfederation, and while the charming Mrs. Jay was giving her now\r\nhistoric dinners and suppers at 133 Broadway, her cousin, Robert R.\r\nLivingston, of No. 3 Broadway, was among her most distinguished\r\nguests. In her home Livingston made those arrangements with Hamilton\r\nand Jay, the Morrises and the Schuylers, that resulted in the\r\noverthrow of Governor Clinton and his supporters in the convention\r\nwhich ratified the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 400.]\r\n\r\nBut after Washington's inauguration, and Jay's appointment as chief\r\njustice of the United States Supreme Court, the Chancellor had been as\r\nintense, if not as violent an opponent of Federalism as Brockholst\r\nLivingston. In their criticism of Jay's treaty these two cousins had\r\nbeen especially bitter. The Chancellor attacked it as \"Cato,\"\r\nBrockholst as \"Decius;\" the one spoke against it on the platform with\r\nAaron Burr, the other voluntarily joined the mob--if he did not\r\nactually throw the stone--that wounded Hamilton; while the Chancellor\r\nsaw a copy of the treaty slowly destroyed at Bowling Green, Brockholst\r\ncoolly witnessed its distinguished author burned in effigy \"in the\r\nFields.\" Relationship did not spare John Jay. Cousin and\r\nbrother-in-law had the \"love frenzy for France,\" which finally\r\nculminated in celebrating the ninth anniversary of the treaty of\r\nalliance between France and America, at which Brockholst became\r\nproudly eloquent, and the Chancellor most happy in the felicity of an\r\nhistoric toast: \"May the present coolness between France and America\r\nproduce, like the quarrels of lovers, a renewal of love.\"\r\n\r\nChancellor Livingston was now in the fifty-first year of his age, tall\r\nand handsome, with an abundance of hair already turning gray, which\r\nfell in ringlets over a square high forehead, lending a certain\r\ndignity that made him appear as great in private life as he was when\r\ngowned and throned in his important office.[82] In the estimation of\r\nhis contemporaries he was one of the most gifted men of his time, and\r\nthe judgment of a later age has not reversed their decision. He added\r\nlearning to great natural ability, and brilliancy to profound thought;\r\nand although so deaf as to make communication with him difficult, he\r\nnearly concealed the defect by his remarkable eloquence and\r\nconversational gifts. Benjamin Franklin called him \"the Cicero of\r\nAmerica.\" His love for the beautiful attracted Edmund Burke. It is\r\ndoubtful if he had a superior in the State in the knowledge of\r\nhistory and the classics, and in the study of science Samuel L.\r\nMitchill alone stood above him. He lacked the creative genius of\r\nHamilton, the prescient gifts of Jay, and the skill of Burr to marshal\r\nmen for selfish purposes, but he was at home in debate with the ablest\r\nmen of his time, a master of sarcasm, of trenchant wit, and of\r\nfelicitous rhetoric.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: \"The tall and graceful figure of Chancellor Livingston,\r\nand his polished wit and classical taste, contributed not a little to\r\ndeepen the impression resulting from the ingenuity of his argument,\r\nthe vivacity of his imagination, and the dignity of his\r\nstation.\"--Chancellor Kent's address before The Law Association of New\r\nYork, October 21, 1836. George Shea, _Life of Alexander Hamilton_,\r\nAppendix.]\r\n\r\nLivingston's candidacy for governor was clearly a dash for the\r\nPresidency. He reasoned, as every ambitious New York statesman has\r\nreasoned from that day to this, that if he could carry the State in an\r\noff year, he would be needed in a presidential year. This reasoning\r\nreduces the governorship to a sort of spring-board from which to vault\r\ninto the White House, and, although only one man in a century has\r\nperformed the feat, it has always figured as a popular and potent\r\nfactor in the settlement of political nominations. George Clinton\r\nthought promotion would come to him, and Hamilton inspired Jay with a\r\nsimilar notion, although it is doubtful if the people ever seriously\r\nconsidered the candidacy of either; but Livingston, sanguine of better\r\ntreatment, was willing voluntarily to withdraw from the professional\r\npath along which he had moved to great distinction, staking more than\r\nhe had a right to stake on success. In his reckoning, as the sequel\r\nshowed, he miscalculated the popularity of Jay as much as Hamilton did\r\nthat of George Clinton in 1789.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor undoubtedly believed the tide of Federalism, which had\r\nbeen steadily rising for six years, was about to ebb. There were\r\nsporadic indications of it. Perhaps Livingston thought it had already\r\nturned, since Republicans had recently won several significant\r\nelections. Two years before DeWitt Clinton and his associates had\r\nsuffered defeat in a city which now returned four assemblymen and one\r\nsenator with an average Republican majority of more than one thousand.\r\nThis indicated that the constant talk of monarchical tendencies, of\r\nHamilton's centralising measures, and of the court customs introduced\r\nby Washington and followed by Adams, was beginning to influence the\r\ntimid into voting with Republicans.\r\n\r\nBut counteracting influences were also at work, which Livingston, in\r\nhis zeal for political honours, possibly did not observe. New England\r\nFederalists, attracted by the fertile valleys of the Hudson and the\r\nMohawk, had filled the western district, and were now holding it\r\nfaithful to the party of Jay and Hamilton. Just at this time, too,\r\nFederalists were bound to be strengthened by the insulting treatment\r\nof American envoys sent to France to restore friendly intercourse\r\nbetween the two republics. President Adams' message, based upon their\r\ncorrespondence, asserted that nothing could be accomplished \"on terms\r\ncompatible with the safety, honour, and essential interests of the\r\nUnited States,\" and advised that immediate steps be taken for the\r\nnational defence. What the President had withheld for prudential\r\nreasons, the public did not know; but it knew that the Cabinet\r\nfavoured an immediate declaration of war, and that the friends of the\r\nAdministration in Congress were preparing for such an event. This of\r\nitself should have taken Livingston out of the gubernatorial contest;\r\nfor if war were declared before the April election, the result would\r\nassuredly be as disastrous to him as the publication of Jay's treaty\r\nin April, 1795, would have been hurtful to the Federalists. But\r\nChancellor Livingston, following the belief of his party that France\r\ndid not intend to go to war with America, accepted what he had been\r\nseeking for months, and entered the campaign with high hopes.\r\n\r\nJay had intended retiring from public life at the close of his first\r\nterm as governor.[83] For a quarter of a century he had been looking\r\nforward to a release from the cares of office, and to the quiet of his\r\ncountry home in Westchester; but \"the indignities which France was at\r\nthat time heaping upon his country,\" says William Jay, his son and\r\nbiographer, \"and the probability that they would soon lead to war,\r\nforbade him to consult his personal gratification.\"[84] On the 6th of\r\nMarch, therefore, he accepted renomination on a ticket with Stephen\r\nVan Rensselaer for lieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 400.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nIt is significant that the anti-Federalists failed to nominate a\r\nlieutenant-governor on the ticket with Livingston. Stephen Van\r\nRensselaer was a Federalist of the old school, a brother-in-law of\r\nHamilton, and a vigorous supporter of his party. It is difficult to\r\naccept the theory that none of his opponents wanted the place; it is\r\neasier to believe that under existing conditions no one of sufficient\r\nprominence cared to make the race, especially after President Adams\r\nhad published the correspondence of the American envoys, disclosing\r\nTalleyrand's demand for $240,000 as a gift and $6,000,000 as a loan,\r\nwith the threat that in the event of failure to comply, \"steps will be\r\ntaken immediately to ravage the coast of the United States by French\r\nfrigates from St. Domingo.\" The display of such despicable greed,\r\ncoupled with the menace, acted very much as the fire of a file of\r\nBritish soldiers did in Boston in 1770, and sent the indignant and\r\neloquent reply of Charles C. Pinckney, then minister to France,\r\nringing throughout the country--\"Millions for defence, but not a cent\r\nfor tribute.\" Within four weeks Congress authorised the establishment\r\nof a navy department, the construction of ten war vessels, the\r\nrecapture of American ships unlawfully seized, the purchase of cannon,\r\narms, and military stores, and the raising of a provisional army of\r\nten thousand, with the acceptance of militia volunteers. The French\r\ntri-colour gave place to the black cockade, a symbol of patriotism in\r\nRevolutionary days, and \"Hail Columbia,\" then first published and set\r\nto the \"President's March,\" was sung to the wildest delight of\r\nAmerican audiences in theatres and churches.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this excitement occurred the election for governor.\r\nThe outcome was a decided change, sending Jay's majority up to\r\n2380.[85] It is not easy to estimate how much of this result was\r\ninfluenced by the rising war cloud, and how much is to be credited to\r\nthe individuality of the candidates. Both probably entered into the\r\nequation. But the fact that Jay carried legislative districts in which\r\nRepublicans sent DeWitt Clinton and Ambrose Spencer to the Senate,\r\nwould indicate that confidence in Jay, if not dislike of Livingston,\r\nhad been the principal factor in this sweeping victory. \"The result of\r\nthis election terminated, as was foreseen,\" wrote William P. Van Ness,\r\nfour years later, \"in the defeat and mortification of Mr. Livingston,\r\nand confirmed the conviction of the party, that the people had no\r\nconfidence in his political integrity, and had been disgusted by his\r\nunwarrantable expectations. His want of popularity was so well known\r\nthat nothing could have induced this inexpedient measure, but a desire\r\nto show the futility of his pretensions, and thus in future avoid his\r\nhitherto unceasing importunities.\"[86]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: John Jay, 16,012; Robert Livingston, 13,632. _Civil\r\nList, State of New York_, (1887), p. 1166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: William P. Van Ness, _Examination of Charges against\r\nAaron Burr_, p. 12.]\r\n\r\nLivingston's search for distinction in the political field seems to\r\nhave resulted in unhappiness. The distinguished ability displayed as\r\nchancellor followed him to the end, but the joy of public life\r\nvanished when he entered the domain of partisan politics. Had he\r\npossessed those qualities of leadership that bind party and friends by\r\nties of unflinching services, he might have reaped the reward his\r\nambition so ardently craved; but his peculiar temper unfitted him for\r\nsuch a career. Jealous, fretful, sensitive, and suspicious, he was as\r\nrestless as his eloquence was dazzling, and, although generous to the\r\npoor, his political methods savoured of selfishness, making enemies,\r\ndivorcing friends, and darkening his pathway with gathering clouds.\r\n\r\nThe story of John Jay's second term is not all a record of success.\r\nStrenuous statesmen, catching the contagion of excitement growing out\r\nof the war news from France, formed themselves into clubs, made\r\neloquent addresses, and cheered John Adams and his readiness to fight\r\nrather than pay tribute, while the Legislature, in extra session,\r\nresponded to Jay's patriotic appeal by unanimously pledging the\r\nPresident the support of the State, and making appropriations for the\r\nrepair of fortifications and the purchase of munitions of war. From\r\nall indications, the Federalists seemed certain to continue in power\r\nfor the next decade, since the more their opponents sympathised with\r\nthe French, the stronger became the sentiment against them. If ever\r\nthere was a period in the history of the United States when the\r\nopposite party should have been encouraged to talk, and to talk loudly\r\nand saucily, it was in the summer of 1798, when the American people\r\nhad waked up to the insulting treatment accorded their envoys in\r\nFrance; but the Federalist leaders, horrified by the bloody record of\r\nthe French Revolution, seemed to cultivate an increasing distrust of\r\nthe common people, whom they now sought to repress by the historic\r\nmeasures known as the Naturalisation Act of June 18, 1798, the Alien\r\nAct of June 25, and the Sedition Act of July 14.\r\n\r\nThe briefest recital of the purpose of these laws is sufficient to\r\nprove the folly of the administration that fathered them, and when one\r\nconsiders the possible lengths to which an official, representing the\r\nPresident, might go if instigated by private or party revenge, Edward\r\nLivingston's declaration that they \"would have disgraced the age of\r\nGothic barbarity\" does not seem too strong.[87] Under the Alien Act\r\npersons not citizens of the United States could be summarily banished\r\nat the sole discretion of the President, without guilt or even\r\naccusation, thus jeopardising the liberty and business of the most\r\npeaceable and well-disposed foreigner. Under the Act of Sedition a\r\ncitizen could be dragged from his bed at night and taken hundreds of\r\nmiles from home to be tried for circulating a petition asking that\r\nthese laws be repealed. The intended effect was to weed out the\r\nforeign-born and crush political opponents, and, the better to\r\naccomplish this purpose, the Alien Act set aside trial by jury, and\r\nthe Sedition Act transferred prosecutions from state courts to federal\r\ntribunals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: \"Let us not establish a tyranny,\" Hamilton wrote Oliver\r\nWolcott.--_Works of_, Vol. 8, p. 491. \"Let us not be cruel or\r\nviolent.\"--_Ibid._, 490. He thought the Alien Law deficient in\r\nguarantees of personal liberty.--_Ibid._, 5, 26.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Jay approved these extreme measures because of alleged secret\r\ncombinations in the interest of the French; and, although no proof of\r\ntheir existence appeared except in the unsupported statements of the\r\npress, he submitted to the Legislature, in January, 1799, several\r\namendments to the Federal Constitution, proposed by Massachusetts,\r\nincreasing the disability of foreigners, and otherwise limiting their\r\nrights to citizenship. The Legislature, still strongly Federal in both\r\nits branches, did not take kindly to the amendments, and the Assembly\r\nrejected them by the surprising vote of sixty-two to thirty-eight.\r\nThen came up the famous Kentucky and Virginia resolutions. The\r\nVirginia resolves, drafted by Madison and passed by the Virginia\r\nLegislature, pronounced the Alien and Sedition laws \"palpable and\r\nalarming infractions of the Constitution;\" the Kentucky resolutions,\r\ndrafted by Jefferson, declared each act to be \"not law, but altogether\r\nvoid and of no force.\" This was nullification, and the States north of\r\nthe Potomac hastened to disavow any such doctrine, although the vote\r\nin the New York Assembly came perilously near indorsing it.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of these measures gave opportunity for the public\r\nopening of a great career in New York legislation--a career that was\r\nto continue into the years made memorable by Martin Van Buren and\r\nWilliam L. Marcy. The record of New York party politics for forty\r\nyears is a record of long and brilliant contests in which Erastus\r\nRoot, if not a recognised party chieftain, was one of the ablest\r\nlieutenants that marshalled on the field of combat. He was a man of\r\ngigantic frame, scholarly and much given to letters, and, although\r\nsomewhat uncouth in manner and rough in speech, his forceful logic,\r\ncoupled with keen wit and biting sarcasm, made him a dreaded opponent\r\nand a welcomed ally. He resembled Hamilton in his independence,\r\nrelying less upon organisation and more upon the strength of his\r\npersonality, yet shrewdly holding close relations with those whose\r\ncareful management and adroit manipulation of the spoils kept men in\r\nline whatever the policy it seemed expedient to adopt. For eleven\r\nyears he served in the Assembly, and thrice became speaker; for eight\r\nyears he served in the Senate, and twice became its president; for\r\ntwelve years he served in the lower house of Congress, and once became\r\nlieutenant-governor. Wherever he served, he was recognised as a\r\nmaster, not always consistent, but always earnest, eloquent, and\r\npopular, fighting relentlessly and tirelessly, and compelling respect\r\neven when unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nJust now Root was an ardent admirer of Aaron Burr and a bitter\r\nopponent of Alexander Hamilton. He was only twenty-six years old.\r\nDuring the contest over the Federal Constitution he was a leader in\r\nboyish sports at his Connecticut home, thinking more of the next\r\nwrestling match and the girl he should escort from the lyceum than of\r\nthe character of the constitution under which he should live; but he\r\ncame to the Assembly in 1798 a staunch supporter of republicanism,\r\nbelieving that Federalists should give place to men inclined to trust\r\nthe people with larger power, and in this spirit he led the debate\r\nagainst the Alien and Sedition laws with such brilliancy that he\r\nleaped into prominence at a single bound. Freedom and fearlessness\r\ncharacterised the work of this young orator, singling him out as the\r\npeople's champion, and giving him the confidence of five thousand\r\n\"Wild Irishmen,\" as Otis called them, who had sought America as an\r\nasylum for the oppressed of all nations. Unrestrained by precedent and\r\nunruled by fear for the future, he spoke with confidence to a people\r\nwhom he delighted with the breadth and liberality of his views,\r\nlifting them onto heights from which they had never before surveyed\r\ntheir political rights.\r\n\r\nIn the debate in the Assembly on the indorsement of the Kentucky\r\nresolutions Root maintained with great force the right of the people's\r\nrepresentatives in the Legislature to express an opinion upon an act\r\nof Congress, however solemn, and he ridiculed the argument that\r\nquestions limited to the judiciary were beyond the jurisdiction of\r\nany other body of men to criticise and condemn. This touched a popular\r\nchord, and if the mere expression of an opinion by the Assembly had\r\nbeen the real question at issue, young Root might have carried his\r\npoint as he did the fight against the amendments proposed by\r\nMassachusetts. But there was one question Root did not successfully\r\nmeet. Although Jefferson's eighth and ninth resolutions--declaring\r\nthat whenever the general government assumed powers not delegated, \"a\r\nnullification of the act is the rightful remedy\" of every State--had\r\nbeen stricken out, the dangerous doctrine was still present in the\r\npreamble, making it apparent to the friends of the Constitution that\r\nthe promulgation of such a monstrous heresy would be worse than the\r\nacts sought to be annulled. It is not clear that Root's understanding\r\nof these resolutions went so far; for the question discussed by him\r\nconcerned only the right of the Legislature to express an opinion\r\nrespecting the wisdom or unwisdom of an act of Congress. Nor does it\r\nappear that he favoured what afterward became known as \"nullification;\"\r\nfor it is certain that when, thirty-four years later, the doctrine\r\ncame up again under John C. Calhoun's leadership, Erastus Root, then\r\nin Congress, struck at it as he would at the head of a viper, becoming\r\nthe fearless expounder of principles which civil war permanently\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nWhile young Root was leading the debate in the Assembly, Ambrose\r\nSpencer led it in the Senate. Spencer's apostacy produced a profound\r\nsensation in political circles. He had given no intimation of a change\r\nof political principles. Although still a young man, barely\r\nthirty-three, he had ranked among the foremost leaders of the\r\nFederalist party, having been honoured as an assistant attorney-general,\r\na state senator, a member of the Council of Appointment, a friend of\r\nHamilton, and the confidential adviser of Jay. The latter's heart\r\nmight well sink within him to be abandoned by such a colleague at a\r\ntime when the stability of the Union was insidiously attacked; nor\r\nought Spencer to have been surprised that public rumour immediately\r\nset to work to find some reason for his change less simple and less\r\nhonest, perhaps, than a dislike of the Federalist policy. Various\r\ncauses have been given for his mysterious behaviour. Some thought him\r\neager for a high mark of presidential favour, possibly a mission\r\nabroad, which was not warmly advocated by Hamilton; others believed\r\nthat the bitter quarrel between Adams and Hamilton influenced him to\r\ndesert a sinking party; but the rumour generally accepted by the\r\nFederalists ascribed it to his failure to become state comptroller in\r\nplace of Samuel Jones, an office which he sought. It was recalled that\r\nshortly after Jones' appointment, Spencer raised the question, with\r\nsome show of bitterness, that Jones' seat in the Senate should be\r\ndeclared vacant.\r\n\r\nSpencer denied the charges with expletives and with emphasis, treating\r\nthe accusations as a calumny, and insisting that his change of\r\nprinciples occurred in the spring of 1798 before his re-election as\r\nsenator. This antedated the alien and sedition measures, but not the\r\nappointment of Samuel Jones, making his conversion contemporary with\r\nthe candidacy for governor of Chancellor Livingston, to whom he was\r\nrelated. It is not unlikely that he shared Livingston's confidence in\r\nan election and thought it a good time to join the party of his\r\nrelative; but whether his change was a matter of principle, of\r\nself-interest, or of resentment, it bitterly stung the Federalists,\r\nwho did not cease to assail him as a turncoat for the flesh-pots.[88]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: \"Ambrose Spencer's politics were inconsistent enough to\r\ndestroy the good name of any man in New England; but he became a\r\nchief-justice of ability and integrity.\"--Henry Adams, _History of the\r\nUnited States_, Vol. 1, p. 112.]\r\n\r\nThe début of the brilliant Root and the St. Paul-like conversion of\r\nAmbrose Spencer were not, however, needed to overthrow a party\r\nresponsible for the famous alien and sedition laws. No one has ever\r\nyet successfully defended this hasty, ill-considered legislation, nor\r\nhas any one ever admitted responsibility for it, except President\r\nAdams who approved it, and who, up to the last moment of his long\r\nlife, contended that it was \"constitutional and salutary, if not\r\nnecessary.\" President Adams had, indeed, refrained from using the\r\npower so lavishly given him; but rash subordinates listened to the\r\ndictate of unwise party leaders. The ridiculous character of these\r\nprosecutions is illustrated by a fine of one hundred dollars because\r\none defendant wished that the wadding used in a salute to John Adams\r\nhad lodged in the ample part of the President's trousers.\r\n\r\nBut the sedition law had a more serious enemy than rash subordinates.\r\nJohn Armstrong, author of the celebrated \"Newburgh Letters,\" and until\r\nrecently a Federalist, wrote a vitriolic petition for its repeal,\r\nwhich Jedediah Peck circulated for signatures. This incited the\r\nindiscreet and excitable Judge Cooper, father of the distinguished\r\nnovelist, to begin a prosecution; and upon his complaint, the United\r\nStates marshal, armed with a bench-warrant, carried off Peck to New\r\nYork City for trial. It is two hundred miles from Cooperstown to the\r\nmouth of the Hudson, and in the spring of 1800 the marshal and his\r\nprisoner were five days on the way. The newspapers reported Peck as\r\n\"taken from his bed at midnight, manacled, and dragged from his home,\"\r\nbecause he dared ask his neighbours to petition Congress to repeal an\r\noffensive law. \"The rule of George Third,\" declared the press, \"was\r\ngracious and loving compared to such tyranny.\" In the wildest delirium\r\nof revolutionary days, when patriots were refusing to drink tea, and\r\nfeeding it to the fishes, New York had not been more deeply stirred\r\nthan now. \"A hundred missionaries in the cause of democracy, stationed\r\nbetween New York and Cooperstown,\" says Hammond, the historian, \"could\r\nnot have done so much for the Republican cause as this journey of\r\nJedediah Peck from Otsego to the capital of the State. It was nothing\r\nless than the public exhibition of a suffering martyr for the freedom\r\nof speech and the press, and for the right of petition.\"[89]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n1, p. 132.]\r\n\r\nThis was the political condition when Aaron Burr, in the spring of\r\n1800, undertook to gain twelve electoral votes for the Republicans by\r\ncarrying the Legislature of New York. It required seventy electoral\r\nvotes to choose a President, and outside of New York the\r\nanti-Federalists could count sixty-one. The capture of this State,\r\ntherefore, would give them a safe majority. Without advertising his\r\npurposes, Burr introduced the sly methods that characterised his\r\nformer campaigns, beginning with the selection of a ticket that would\r\ncommend itself to all, and ending with an organisation that would do\r\ncredit to the management of the later-day chiefs of Tammany. To avoid\r\nthe already growing rivalry between the Clinton and Livingston\r\nfactions, George Clinton and Brockholst Livingston headed the ticket,\r\nfollowed by Horatio Gates of Revolutionary fame, John Broome, soon to\r\nbe lieutenant-governor, Samuel Osgood, for two years Washington's\r\npostmaster-general, John Swartout, already known for his vigorous\r\nrecord in the Assembly, and others equally acceptable. Burr himself\r\nstood for the county of Orange. For the first time in the history of\r\npolitical campaigning, too, local managers prepared lists of voters,\r\ncanvassed wards by streets, held meetings throughout the city, and\r\nintroduced other methods of organisation common enough nowadays, but\r\ndecidedly novel then.\r\n\r\nHamilton was alive to the importance of the April election, but\r\nscarcely responsible for the critical character of the situation. He\r\nhad not approved the alien and sedition measures, nor did he commit\r\nhimself to the persecuting policy sanctioned by most Federal leaders,\r\nand although he favoured suppressing newspaper libels against the\r\ngovernment, he was himself alien-born, and of a mind too broad not to\r\nunderstand the danger of arousing foreign-born citizens against his\r\nparty on lines of national sentiment. \"If we make no false step,\" he\r\nwrote Oliver Wolcott, \"we shall be essentially united, but if we push\r\nthings to extremes, we shall then give to faction body and\r\nsolidity.\"[90] It was hasty United States attorneys and indiscreet\r\nlocal politicians rather than the greatest of the Federal leaders,\r\nwho gave \"to faction body and solidity.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 491.]\r\n\r\nHamilton threw himself with energy into the desperate fight. For four\r\ndays, from April 29 to May 2, while the polls were open, he visited\r\nevery voting precinct, appealing to the public in his wonderfully\r\npersuasive and captivating manner. On several occasions Burr and\r\nHamilton met, and it was afterward recalled that courtesy\r\ncharacterised the conduct of each toward the other, one champion\r\nwaiting while the other took his turn. Rarely if ever in the history\r\nof the country have two men of such ability and astuteness\r\nparticipated in a local canvass. The rivalry was all the more exciting\r\nbecause it was a rivalry of styles as well as of capacities. Burr was\r\nsmooth, polished, concise, never diffuse or declamatory, always\r\nserious and impressive. If we may accept contemporary judgment, he was\r\na good speaker whom everybody was curious to hear, and from whom no\r\none turned away in disappointment. On the other hand, Hamilton was an\r\nacknowledged orator, diffuse, ornate, full of metaphor, with flashes\r\nof poetical genius, revelling in exuberant strength, and endowed with\r\na gift of argumentative eloquence which appealed to the intellect and\r\nthe feelings at the same time. Erastus Root says Hamilton's words were\r\nso well chosen, and his sentences so finely formed into a swelling\r\ncurrent, that the hearer would be captivated if not convinced, while\r\nBurr's arguments were generally methodised and compact. To this Root\r\nadded a judgment, after thirty years' experience in public life at\r\nWashington and in New York, that \"they were much the greatest men in\r\nthe State, and perhaps the greatest men in the United States.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the polls closed the Republicans had carried the Legislature by\r\ntwenty-two majority on joint ballot. This secured to them the election\r\nof the needed twelve presidential electors. To recover their loss the\r\nFederalists now clamoured for a change in the law transferring the\r\nelection of presidential electors from the Legislature to districts\r\ncreated for that purpose. Such an amendment would give the\r\nFederalists six of the twelve electors.\r\n\r\nThis was Hamilton's plan. In an earnest plea he urged Jay to convene\r\nthe Legislature in extraordinary session for this purpose. \"The\r\nanti-Federal party,\" he wrote to the Governor, \"is a composition\r\nindeed of very incongruous materials, but all tending to mischief;\r\nsome of them to the overthrow of the government by stripping it of its\r\ndue energies; others of them by revolutionising it after the manner of\r\nBonaparte. The government must not be confided to the custody of its\r\nenemies, and, although the measure proposed is open to objection, a\r\npopular government cannot stand if one party calls to its aid all the\r\nresources which vice can give, and the other, however pressing the\r\nemergency, feels itself obliged to confine itself within the ordinary\r\nforms of delicacy and decorum.\"[91]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 549.]\r\n\r\nJay's response to Hamilton's proposal is not of record, but some time\r\nafterward the great Federalist's letter was found carefully filed\r\namong the papers in the public archives, bearing an indorsement in the\r\nGovernor's handwriting: \"This is a measure for party purposes which I\r\nthink it would not become me to adopt.\"\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of Jay's action has been doubted. He was about to retire\r\nfrom public life, it was said, with no political future before him,\r\nand with that courage which inspires a man under such circumstances,\r\nhe declined to act. But Jay's treatment of Hamilton's suggestion\r\nstands out conspicuously as his best judgment at the most trying\r\nmoment in a long and eventful life. Jay was a stalwart Federalist. He\r\nhad supported Washington and Hamilton in the making of a federal\r\nconstitution; he had approved the alien and sedition laws; he had\r\nfavourably reported to the Legislature the proposed amendments of\r\nMassachusetts, limiting service in Congress to native-born citizens;\r\nhe regarded the advent of Jefferson and his ideas with as much alarm\r\nas Hamilton, and he knew as well as Hamilton that the adoption of the\r\ndistrict plan of choosing electors would probably defeat the\r\nVirginian; but to call an extra session of the Legislature for the\r\npurpose indicated by Hamilton, would defeat the expressed will of the\r\npeople as much as the action of the state canvassers defeated it in\r\n1792. Should he follow such a precedent and save his party, perhaps\r\nhis country, from the dire ills so vividly portrayed by Hamilton? The\r\nresponsibility was upon him, not upon Hamilton, and he wisely refused\r\nto do what the people of the State had so generally and properly\r\ncondemned in the canvassers.\r\n\r\nHamilton's proposition naturally provoked the indignation of his\r\nopponents, and later writers have used it as a text for unlimited\r\nvituperation; but if one may judge from what happened and continued to\r\nhappen during the next three decades, not a governor who followed Jay\r\nin those eventful years would have declined under similar\r\ncircumstances to concur in Hamilton's suggestion. It was undoubtedly a\r\ndesperate proposal, but it was squarely in line with the practice of\r\nparty leaders of that day. George Clinton countenanced, if he did not\r\nabsolutely advise, the deliberate disfranchisement of hundreds of\r\nvoters in 1792 that he might continue governor. A few years later, in\r\n1816, methods quite as disreputable and unscrupulous were practised,\r\nthat Republicans might continue to control the Council of Appointment.\r\nHamilton's suggestion involved no concealment, as in the case of the\r\nManhattan Bank, which Jay approved; no violation of law, as in the\r\nOtsego election case, which Clinton approved; no deliberate fraud, as\r\nin the Allen-Fellows case, which Tompkins approved. All this does not\r\nlessen the wrong involved in Hamilton's proposed violation of moral\r\nethics, but it places the suggestion in the environment to which it\r\nproperly belongs, making it appear no worse if no better than the\r\npolitical practices of that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMISTAKES OF HAMILTON AND BURR\r\n\r\n1800\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ten months following the Republican triumph in New York on May 2,\r\n1800, were fateful ones for Hamilton and Burr. It is not easy to\r\nsuggest the greater sufferer, Burr with his victory, or Hamilton with\r\nhis defeat. Hamilton's bold expedients began at once; Burr's desperate\r\nschemes waited until after the election in November; but when the\r\nconflict was over, the political influence of each had ebbed like\r\nwater in a bay after a tidal wave. Although Jay's refusal to reconvene\r\nthe old Legislature in extra session surprised Hamilton as much as the\r\nRepublican victory itself, the great Federalist did not despair. He\r\nstill thought it possible to throw the election of President into the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and to that end he wrote his friends to give\r\nequal support to John Adams and Charles C. Pinckney, the candidates of\r\nthe Federal party. \"This is the only thing,\" he said, \"that can\r\npossibly save us from the fangs of Jefferson.\"[92]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 549. Letter to\r\nTheo. Sedgwick.]\r\n\r\nBut the relations between Adams and Hamilton were now to break. For\r\ntwelve years Hamilton had kept Adams angry. He began in 1789 with the\r\ninconsiderate and needless scheme of scattering the electoral votes of\r\nFederalists for second place, lest Washington fail of the highest\r\nnumber, and thus reduced Adams' vote to thirty-four, while Washington\r\nreceived sixty-nine. In 1796 he advised similar tactics, in order that\r\nThomas Pinckney might get first place. For the past three years the\r\nPresident had endured the mortification of having Hamilton control\r\nhis cabinet advisers. After the loss of New York, however, Adams\r\nturned elsewhere for strength, appointing John Marshall secretary of\r\nstate in place of Timothy Pickering, and Samuel Dexter secretary of\r\nwar in place of James McHenry. The mutual dislike of Hamilton and\r\nAdams had become so intensified that the slightest provocation on the\r\npart of either would make any form of political reconciliation\r\nimpossible, and Adams' reconstruction of his Cabinet furnished this\r\nprovocation. Pickering and McHenry were Hamilton's best supporters.\r\nThey had done more to help him and to embarrass Adams, and their\r\ndismissal, because of the loss of New York, made Hamilton thirsty for\r\nrevenge. Pickering suggested \"a bold and frank exposure of Adams,\"\r\noffering to furnish the facts if Hamilton would put them together, and\r\nagreeing to arrange with George Cabot and other ultra Federalists of\r\nNew England, known as the \"Essex Junto,\" to throw Adams behind Charles\r\nC. Pinckney in the electoral vote. Their plan was to start Pinckney as\r\nthe second Federalist candidate, with the hope that parties would be\r\nso divided as to secure his election for President. It was nothing\r\nmore than the old \"double chance\" manoeuvres of 1796, when Thomas\r\nPinckney was Hamilton's choice for President; but the iniquity of the\r\nscheme was the deception practised upon the voters who desired Adams.\r\n\r\nOf course, Adams soon learned of the revival of this old conspiracy,\r\nand passionately and hastily opened a raking fire upon the \"Essex\r\nJunto,\" calling them a \"British faction,\" with Hamilton as its chief,\r\na designation to which the Republican press had made them peculiarly\r\nsensitive. This aroused Hamilton, who, preliminary to a quarrel,\r\naddressed the President, asking if he had mentioned the writer as one\r\nwho belonged to a British faction. Receiving no reply, he again wrote\r\nthe President, angrily repelling all aspersions of the kind. This the\r\nPresident likewise ignored.\r\n\r\nThen Hamilton listened to Timothy Pickering. Fiery as his temper had\r\noften proved, and grotesquely obstinate as he had sometimes shown\r\nhimself, Hamilton's most erratic impulse appears like the coolness of\r\nJay when contrasted with the conduct upon which he now entered. The\r\nletter he proposed to write, ostensibly in justification of himself,\r\nwas apparently intended for private circulation at some future day\r\namong Federal leaders, to whom it would furnish reasons why electors\r\nshould unite in preferring Pinckney. It is known, too, that Hamilton's\r\ncoolest and ablest advisers opposed such a letter, recalling the\r\ncongressional caucus agreement, which he had himself advised, to vote\r\nfairly for both Adams and Pinckney. Besides, to impair confidence in\r\nAdams just at that moment, it was argued, would impair confidence in\r\nthe Federal party, while at best such a letter could only produce\r\nconfusion without compensatory results. But between Adams and\r\nJefferson, Hamilton now preferred the latter. \"I will never be\r\nresponsible for him by my direct vote,\" he wrote in May, 1800, \"even\r\nthough the consequence be the election of Jefferson.\"[93] Moreover,\r\nHamilton was accustomed to give, not to receive orders. Had Washington\r\nlived, Hamilton would doubtless never have written the letter, but now\r\nhe wrote it, printed it, and in a few days was forced to publish it,\r\nsince garbled extracts began appearing in the press. Many theories\r\nhave been advanced as to how it fell into the hands of a public\r\nprinter, some fanciful, others ridiculous, and none, perhaps,\r\nabsolutely truthful. The story that Burr unwittingly coaxed a\r\nprinter's errand boy to give him a copy, is not corroborated by\r\nMatthew L. Davis; but, however the publication happened, it was not\r\nintended to happen in that way and at that time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 552.]\r\n\r\nIt was an ugly letter, not up to Hamilton's best work. The vindication\r\nof himself and the Pinckneys lost itself in the severity of the attack\r\nupon Adams, whose career was reviewed from the distant day of an\r\nunsound judgment ventured in military affairs during the Revolution,\r\nto the latest display of a consuming egotism, vanity, and jealousy as\r\nPresident. In a word, all the quarrels, resentments, and antagonisms\r\nwhich had torn and rent the Federal party for four years, but which,\r\nthanks to Washington, had not become generally known, were now, in a\r\nmoment, officially exposed to the whole country, to the great\r\nastonishment of most Federalists, and to the great delight of all\r\nRepublicans. \"If the single purpose had been to defeat the President,\"\r\nsaid John Adams, \"no more propitious moment could have been chosen.\"\r\nFisher Ames declared that \"the question is not how we shall fight, but\r\nhow we shall fall.\" In vain did Hamilton journey through New England,\r\nstruggling to gain votes for Pinckney; in vain did the \"Essex Junto\"\r\ndeplore the appearance of a document certain to do their Jacobin\r\nopponents great service. The party, already practically defeated by\r\nits alien and sedition legislation, and now inflamed with angry\r\nfeelings, hastened on to the inevitable catastrophe like a boat sucked\r\ninto the rushing waters of Niagara, while the party of Jefferson,\r\nunited in principle, and encouraged by the divisions of their\r\nadversaries, marched on to easy victory. When the result was known,\r\nJefferson and Burr had each seventy-three electoral votes, Adams\r\nsixty-five, Pinckney sixty-four, and Jay one.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to realise the arguments which persuaded Hamilton to\r\nfollow the suggestion of the fallen minister. Hot-tempered and\r\nimpatient of restraint as he was, he knew Adams' attack had only paid\r\nhim in kind. Nor is mitigation of Hamilton's conduct found in the\r\nstatement, probably true, that the party could not in any case have\r\ncarried the election. The great mass of Federalists believed, as\r\nHamilton wrote Jay when asking an extra session of the Legislature,\r\nthat the defeat of Jefferson was \"the only means to save the nation\r\nfrom more disasters,\" and they naturally looked to him to accomplish\r\nthat defeat. Of all men that ever led a political party, therefore, it\r\nwas Hamilton's duty to sink personal antipathy, but in this attack\r\nupon Adams he seems deliberately to have sinned against the light.\r\nThis was the judgment of men of his own day, and at the end of a\r\ncentury it is the judgment of men who cherish his teachings and revere\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\nWhile Hamilton wrote and worried and wrestled, Aaron Burr rested on\r\nthe well-earned laurels of victory. It had been a great fight. George\r\nClinton did not take kindly to Thomas Jefferson, and stubbornly\r\nresisted allowing the use of his name to aid the Virginian's\r\npromotion; Horatio Gates and other prominent citizens who had left the\r\npolitical arena years before, if they could be said ever to have\r\nentered it, were also indisposed to head a movement that seemed to\r\nthem certain to end in rout and confusion; but Burr held on until\r\nscruples disappeared, and their names headed a winning ticket. It was\r\nthe first ray of light to break the Republican gloom, and when, six\r\nmonths later, the Empire State declared for Jefferson and Burr it\r\nadded to the halo already surrounding the grandson of Jonathan\r\nEdwards.\r\n\r\nIt was known that Jefferson and Burr had run very evenly, and by the\r\nmiddle of December, 1800, it became rumoured that their vote was a\r\ntie. \"If such should be the result,\" Burr wrote Samuel Smith, a\r\nRepublican congressman from Maryland, \"every man who knows me ought to\r\nknow that I would utterly disclaim all competition. Be assured that\r\nthe Federalist party can entertain no wish for such an exchange. As to\r\nmy friends, they would dishonour my views and insult my feelings by a\r\nsuspicion that I would submit to be instrumental in counteracting the\r\nwishes and the expectations of the people of the United States. And I\r\nnow constitute you my proxy to declare these sentiments if the\r\noccasion should require.\"[94] At the time this letter was much\r\napplauded at public dinners and other Republican gatherings as proof\r\nof Burr's respect for the will of the people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: James Parton, _Life of Aaron Burr_, 267.]\r\n\r\nBut the Federalists had plans of their own. \"To elect Burr would be to\r\ncover the opposition with chagrin, and to sow among them the seeds of\r\na morbid division,\" wrote Harrison Gray Otis of Massachusetts.[95]\r\nGradually this sentiment took possession of New England and the Middle\r\nStates, until it seemed to be the prevailing opinion of the Federal\r\nparty. \"Some, indeed most of our eastern friends are warm in support\r\nof Burr,\" said Gouverneur Morris, which James A. Bayard of Delaware\r\ncorroborated in a note to Hamilton. \"There appears to be a strong\r\ninclination in a majority of the Federal party to support Burr,\" he\r\nsaid.[96] \"The current has already acquired considerable force, and is\r\nmanifestly increasing.\" John Rutledge, governor of South Carolina,\r\nthought \"his promotion will be prodigiously afflicting to the Virginia\r\nfaction, and must disjoint the party. If Mr. B.'s Presidency be\r\nproductive of evils, it will be very easy for us to get rid of him.\r\nOpposed by the Virginia party, it will be his interest to conciliate\r\nthe Federalists.\"[97] Theodore Sedgwick, speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, likewise declared that \"most of the Federalists are\r\nfor Burr. It is very evident that the Jacobins dread this appointment\r\nmore even than that of General Pinckney. If he be elected by the\r\nFederalists against the hearty opposition of the Jacobins, the wounds\r\nmutually given and received will probably be incurable. Each will have\r\ncommitted the unpardonable sin. Burr must depend on good men for his\r\nsupport, and that support he cannot receive, but by a conformity to\r\ntheir views. At first, I confess, I was strongly disposed to give\r\nJefferson the preference, but the more I have reflected, the more I\r\nhave inclined to the other.\"[98]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _Ibid._, 267.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: James Parton, _Life of Aaron Burr_, 270.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: _Ibid._, 275.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: _Ibid._, 275.]\r\n\r\nTo such a course Hamilton was bitterly opposed, not only because he\r\ndistrusted Burr more than he did Jefferson, but because the\r\nFederalists should leave the responsibility of a selection to the\r\nRepublicans and thus in nowise be answerable for the consequences. \"If\r\nthe anti-Federalists who prevailed in the election,\" he wrote Bayard\r\nof Delaware, \"are left to take their own man, they remain responsible,\r\nand the Federalists remain free, united, and without stain, in a\r\nsituation to resist with effect pernicious measures. If the\r\nFederalists substitute Burr, they adopt him, and become answerable for\r\nhim. Whatever may be the theory of the case, abroad and at home, Mr.\r\nBurr must become, in fact, the man of our party; and if he acts ill,\r\nwe must share in the blame and disgrace. By adopting him, we do all we\r\ncan to reconcile the minds of Federalists to him, and we prepare them\r\nfor the effectual operation of his acts. He will, doubtless, gain many\r\nof them; and the Federalists will become a disorganised and\r\ncontemptible party. Can there be any serious question between the\r\npolicy of leaving the anti-Federalists to be answerable for the\r\nelevation of an objectionable man, and that of adopting him ourselves,\r\nand becoming answerable for a man who, on all hands, is acknowledged\r\nto be a complete Catiline? 'Tis enough to state the question to\r\nindicate the answer, if reason, not passion, presides in the\r\ndecision.\"[99]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 581.]\r\n\r\nGouverneur Morris, now a United States senator, had already taken a\r\nsimilar position. Bayard of Delaware, who carried the vote of the\r\nlittle State in his pocket, and several other leading Federalists,\r\nlistened with profound respect; but the great portion of the party,\r\nmaddened by reverses, eager for revenge, and not yet mindless of\r\nHamilton's campaign indiscretion, was in no temper to follow such\r\nprudent advice. As already indicated, the disposition was \"to cover\r\nthe opposition with chagrin,\" and \"to sow among them the seeds of\r\nmorbid division.\" Nor did they agree with Hamilton's estimate of Burr,\r\nwhich seemed to them attributable to professional and personal feuds,\r\nbut maintained that he was a matter-of-fact man, artful and dexterous\r\nto accomplish his ends, and without pernicious theories, whose very\r\nselfishness was a guard against mischievous foreign predilection, and\r\nwhose local situation was helpful to his appreciation of the utility\r\nof the country's commercial and federal systems, while his elevation\r\nto the Presidency would be a mortal stab to the Jacobins, breeding\r\ninvincible hatred and compelling him to lean on the Federalists, who\r\nhad nothing to fear from his ambition, since it would be checked by\r\nhis good sense, or from any scheme of usurpation that he might\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Hamilton combat these points, insisting that Burr was a\r\nman of extreme and irregular ambition, selfish to a degree which even\r\nexcluded social affection, and decidedly profligate. He admitted that\r\nhe was far more artful than wise, far more dexterous than able, but\r\nheld that artfulness and dexterity were objections rather than\r\nrecommendations, while he thought a systematic statesman should have a\r\ntheory. \"No general principles,\" he said, \"will work much better than\r\nerroneous ones.\"[100] As to foreign predilection, he thought Burr as\r\nwarm a partisan of France as Jefferson, and instead of leaning on good\r\nmen, whom he knew would never support his bad projects, he would\r\nendeavour to disorganise both parties, and from the wreck form a third\r\nout of conspirators and other men fitted by character to carry out his\r\nschemes of usurpation. As the campaign advanced he became more\r\nemphatic, insisting that Burr's election would disgrace the country\r\nabroad, and that no agreement with him could be relied upon. \"As well\r\nthink to bind a giant by a cobweb as his ambition by promises.\"[101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 584.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: _Ibid._, 581.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the electoral count, as already anticipated, had\r\nthrown the election into the House of Representatives, where it would\r\nbe decided on the 11th of February, 1801. In the House the Republicans\r\ncontrolled eight States to the Federalists' six, with Maryland and\r\nVermont without a majority of either party. To elect Jefferson,\r\ntherefore, an additional State must be secured, and to prevent it, if\r\npossible, the Federalists, by a party caucus held in January, resolved\r\nto support Burr, Bayard and three others, any one of whom could decide\r\nthe choice for Jefferson, reserving the right to limit the contest to\r\nMarch 4, and thus avoid the risk of general anarchy by a failure to\r\nelect.\r\n\r\nVery naturally the Republicans became alarmed and ugly. Jefferson\r\nwrote Madison of the deplorable tie, suggesting that it had produced\r\ngreat dismay and gloom among Republicans and exultation among\r\nFederalists, \"who openly declare they will prevent an election.\"[102]\r\nJames Gunn, a United States senator from Georgia and a Federalist,\r\nadvised Hamilton that \"the Jacobins are determined to resist the\r\nelection of Burr at every hazard, and I am persuaded they have taken\r\ntheir ground with a fixed resolution to destroy the government rather\r\nthan yield their point.\"[103] Madison thought if the then House of\r\nRepresentatives did not choose Jefferson, the next House would do so,\r\nsupported as he was by the great body of the people, who would no\r\nlonger submit \"to the degradation of America by attempts to make Burr\r\nthe President.\"[104]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: James Parton, _Life of Aaron Burr_, 274.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: _Ibid._, 274.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: _Ibid._, 274.]\r\n\r\nNot a word came from Burr. Jefferson tried repeatedly to bring him to\r\nan explicit understanding without avail. His only published utterance\r\non the subject, save the letter to Samuel Smith, was in a family note\r\nof January 15 to his son-in-law, Joseph Allston of South Carolina, in\r\nwhich he spoke of the tie as exciting great speculation and much\r\nanxiety, adding, \"I believe that all will be well, and that Jefferson\r\nwill be our President.\"[105] Five days before this, Speaker Sedgwick\r\ninformed Hamilton that \"Burr has expressed his displeasure at the\r\npublication of his letter by Samuel Smith,\"[106] which, wrote Bayard\r\non January 7, \"is here understood to have proceeded either from a\r\nfalse calculation as to the result of the electoral vote, or was\r\nintended as a cover to blind his own party.\"[107] But there was no\r\ndanger of Joseph Allston publishing his note, at least not until the\r\nfight was over.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: _Ibid._, 279.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: _Ibid._, 272.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: _Ibid._, 272.]\r\n\r\nBurr's letter to his son-in-law bore date at Albany. Being a member of\r\nthe Legislature he had gone there early in January, where he not only\r\nkept silent but mysteriously aloof, although his lobbyists thronged\r\nWashington in such numbers that Senator Morris, on February 14, asked\r\nhis colleague, John Armstrong, \"how it happened that Burr, who is four\r\nhundred miles off, has agents here at work with great activity, while\r\nMr. Jefferson, who is on the spot, does nothing?\"[108] That these\r\nagents understood their mission and were quite as active as Morris\r\nrepresented, was evident by the reports sent from time to time to\r\nHamilton, who remained in New York. \"Some who pretend to know his\r\nviews,\" wrote Morris, \"think he will bargain with the Federalists.\"[109]\r\nBayard was also approached. \"Persons friendly to Mr. Burr state\r\ndistinctly that he is willing to consider the Federalists as his\r\nfriends, and to accept the office of President as their gift.\"[110] As\r\nearly as January 10 Governor Rutledge wrote that \"we are assured by a\r\ngentleman who lately had some conversation with Mr. Burr on this\r\nsubject that he is disposed to maintain and expand our systems.\"[111]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: _Jefferson's Diary_, Feb. 14, 1801.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: James Parton, _Life of Aaron Burr_, p. 272.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: _Ibid._, 272.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: _Ibid._, 275.]\r\n\r\nAs the campaign proceeded it became evident to Burr that Republicans\r\nwere needed as well as Federalists, and a bright young man, William P.\r\nVan Ness, who had accompanied Burr to Albany as a favourite companion,\r\nwrote Edward Livingston, the brilliant New York congressman, that \"it\r\nis the sense of the Republicans in this State that, after some trials\r\nin the House, Mr. Jefferson should be given up for Mr. Burr.\"[112]\r\nThis was wholly conjectural, and Burr and his young friend knew it;\r\nbut it was a part of the game, since Burr, so Hamilton wrote Morris,\r\n\"perfectly understands himself with Edward Livingston, who will be his\r\nagent at the seat of government,\" adding that Burr had volunteered the\r\nfurther information \"that the Federalists might proceed in the\r\ncertainty that, upon a second ballot New York and Tennessee would join\r\nhim.\"[113] There is no doubt Burr believed then, and for some time\r\nafterward, that Edward Livingston was his friend, but he did not know\r\nthat Jefferson had offered the secretaryship of the navy to Edward's\r\nbrother, the powerful Chancellor,[114] or that the Chancellor's young\r\nbrother was filling Jefferson's diary with the doings and sayings of\r\nthose who were interested in Burr's election. Edward got a United\r\nStates attorneyship for his treachery, and soon after became a\r\ndefaulter for thirty thousand dollars under circumstances of culpable\r\ncarelessness, as the Treasury thought.[115]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: William P. Van Ness, _Examination of Charges against\r\nAaron Burr_, p. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 586.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Jefferson to Livingston, Feb. 24, 1801; _Jefferson's\r\nWorks_, Vol. 4, p. 360.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Henry Adams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n173. _Ibid._, Vol. 1, p. 113.]\r\n\r\nThe voting began on February 11. On the first ballot eight States\r\nvoted for Jefferson and six for Burr, Vermont and Maryland being\r\nneutralised by an even party division. In this manner the voting\r\ncontinued for six days, through thirty-five ballots, the House taking\r\nrecesses to give members rest, caucuses opportunity to meet, and the\r\nsick time to be brought in on their beds. Finally, on the thirty-sixth\r\nballot, the Vermont Federalist withdrew, and the four Maryland\r\nFederalists, with Bayard of Delaware, put in blanks, giving Jefferson\r\nten States and Burr five.\r\n\r\nBurr had played his game with the skill of a master. The tactics that\r\nelected him to the United States Senate in 1791 and made him a\r\ngubernatorial possibility in 1792 were repeated on a larger scale and\r\nshrouded in deeper mystery. He had appeared to disavow any intention\r\nof supplanting Jefferson, and yet had played for Federalist and\r\nRepublican support so cleverly that Jefferson pronounced his conduct\r\n\"honourable and decisive, and greatly embarrassing\" to those who tried\r\nto \"debauch him from his good faith.\" In the evening of the\r\ninauguration, President and Vice President received together the\r\ncongratulations of their countrymen at the presidential mansion. At\r\nAlbany banqueting Republicans drank the health of \"Aaron Burr, Vice\r\nPresident of the United States; his uniform and patriotic exertions in\r\nfavour of Republicanism eclipsed only by his late disinterested\r\nconduct.\"\r\n\r\nBut when soberer thoughts came the Republican mind was disturbed with\r\nthe question why Burr, after the Federalists had openly resolved to\r\nsupport him, did not proclaim on the housetop what he had written to\r\nSamuel Smith before the tie was known. Gradually the truth began to\r\ndawn as men talked and compared notes, and before three months had\r\nelapsed Jefferson's estimate of Burr's character corresponded with\r\nHamilton's. It is of record that from 1790 to 1800 Jefferson\r\nconsidered him \"for sale,\" and when the Virginians, after twice\r\nrefusing to vote for him, finally sustained him for Vice President,\r\nthey did so repenting their act.[116]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Henry Adams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n229. Jefferson's _Anas_; _Works_, Vol. 9, p. 207.]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to indicate the source of Burr's inherent badness. His\r\nfather, a clergyman of rare scholarship and culture, became, at the\r\nage of thirty-two, the second president of Princeton College, while\r\nJonathan Edwards, his maternal grandfather, whose \"Freedom of the\r\nWill\" made him an intellectual world-force, became its third\r\npresident; but if one may accept contemporary judgment, Aaron Burr had\r\nscarcely one good or great quality of heart. Like Lord Chesterfield,\r\nhis favourite author, he had intellect without truth or virtue; like\r\nChesterfield, too, he was small in stature and slender.[117] Here,\r\nhowever, the comparison must end if Lord Hervey's description of\r\nChesterfield be accepted, for instead of broad, rough features, and\r\nan ugly face, Burr's personal appearance, suggested by the delicately\r\nchiselled features in the marble, was the gift of a mother noted for\r\nbeauty as well as for the inheritance of her father's great\r\nintellectuality. Writers never forget the large black eyes, keen and\r\npenetrating, so irresistible to gifted and beautiful women. They came\r\nfrom the Edwards side; but from whence came the absence of honour that\r\ndistinguished this son and grandson of the Princeton presidents,\r\ntradition does not inform us.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: \"When the Senate met at ten o'clock on the morning of\r\nMarch 4, 1801, Aaron Burr stood at the desk, and having duly sworn to\r\nsupport the Constitution took his seat in the chair as Vice President.\r\nThis quiet, gentlemanly and rather dignified figure, hardly taller\r\nthan Madison, and dressed in much the same manner, impressed with\r\nfavour all who first met him. An aristocrat imbued in the morality of\r\nLord Chesterfield and Napoleon Bonaparte, Colonel Burr was the chosen\r\nhead of Northern democracy, idol of the wards of New York City, and\r\naspirant to the highest offices he could reach by means legal or\r\nbeyond the law; for, as he pleased himself with saying after the\r\nmanner of the First Consul of the French Republic, 'great souls care\r\nlittle for small morals.'\"--Henry Adams, _History of the United\r\nStates_, Vol. 1, p. 195.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nJOHN JAY AND DeWITT CLINTON\r\n\r\n1800\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election that decided the contest for Jefferson, returned DeWitt\r\nClinton to the State Senate, and a Republican majority to the\r\nAssembly. As soon as the Legislature met, therefore, Clinton proposed\r\na new Council of Appointment. Federalists shrieked in amazement at\r\nsuch a suggestion, since the existing Council had served little more\r\nthan half its term. To this Republicans replied, good naturedly, that\r\nalthough party conditions were reversed, arguments remained the same,\r\nand reminded them that in 1794, when an anti-Federalist Council had\r\nserved only a portion of its term, the Federalists compelled an\r\nimmediate change. Whatever was fair for Federalists then, they argued,\r\ncould not be unfair for Republicans now. If it was preposterous, as\r\nJosiah Ogden Hoffman had asserted, for a Council to serve out its full\r\nterm in 1794, it was preposterous for the Council of 1800 to serve out\r\nits full term; if Schuyler was right that it was a dangerous and\r\nunconstitutional usurpation of power for the anti-Federalist Council\r\nto continue its sittings, it was a dangerous and unconstitutional\r\nusurpation of power for the Federalist Council of 1800 to continue its\r\nsittings. Of course Federalists were wrong in 1794, and Republicans\r\nwere wrong in 1800, but there was as much poetic justice in the\r\nsituation as a Republican could desire. As soon as the Assembly had\r\norganised, therefore, DeWitt Clinton, Ambrose Spencer, Robert\r\nRoseboom, and John Sanders became the Council of Appointment. Sanders\r\nwas a Federalist, but Roseboom was a Republican, whose pliancy and\r\nweakness made him the tool of Clinton and Spencer.\r\n\r\nDeWitt Clinton had at last come to his own. Until now his life had\r\nbeen uncheckered by important incident and unmarked by political\r\nachievement. He had run rapidly through the grammar school of Little\r\nBritain, his native town; through the academy at Kingston, the only\r\none then in the State; through Columbia College, which he entered as a\r\njunior at fifteen and from which he graduated at the head of his\r\nclass; and through his law studies with Samuel Jones. In 1789 came an\r\nappointment as private secretary to his uncle, George Clinton. When\r\nGovernor Jay sought the assistance of another in 1795, Clinton resumed\r\nthe law; but he continued to practise politics for a living, and at\r\nlast found himself in the Assembly of 1797. He was then twenty-eight,\r\nstrong, handsome, and well equipped for any struggle. He had devoted\r\nhis leisure moments to reading, for which he had a passion that lasted\r\nhim all his lifetime. He was especially fond of scientific studies,\r\nand of the active-minded Samuel L. Mitchill, six years his senior, who\r\ngave scientific reputation to the whole State.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his love for science, DeWitt Clinton was a born\r\npolitician, with all the characteristic incongruities incident to such\r\na life. He had the selfishness of Livingston, the inconsistency of\r\nSpencer, the imperiousness of Root, and the ability of a statesman.\r\nUnlike most other men of his party, he did not rely wholly upon\r\ndiscipline and organisation, or upon party fealty and courtesy.\r\nHamilton had cherished the hope that Clinton might become a\r\nFederalist, not because he was a trimmer, or would seek a party in\r\npower simply for the spoils in sight, but because he had the breadth\r\nand liberality of enlightened opinions, the prophetic instinct, and\r\nthe force of character to make things go his way, without drifting\r\ninto success by a fortunate turn in tide and wind. He was not a mere\r\nday-dreamer, a theorist, a philosopher, a scholar, although he\r\npossessed the gifts of each. He was, rather, a man of action--self-willed,\r\nself-reliant, independent--as ambitious as Burr without his slippery\r\nways, and as determined as Hamilton with all his ability to criticise\r\nan opponent. Clinton relied not more upon men than upon measures, and\r\nin the end the one thing that made him superior to all his\r\ncontemporaries of the nineteenth century was a never-failing belief in\r\nthe possibility of success along lines marked out for his life's work.\r\nHe had faults and he committed errors. His one great political defect\r\nfilled him with faults. He would be all or nothing. Attachment to his\r\ninterests was the one supreme and only test of fitness for favours or\r\nfriendship, and at one time or another he quarrelled with every friend\r\nwho sought to retain independence of action.\r\n\r\nJust now Clinton was looking with great expectancy into the political\r\nfuture. From defeat in 1796 he had reached the Assembly in 1797, and\r\nthen passed to the State Senate in 1798; and from defeat in 1799 he\r\npassed again into the Senate in 1800. Thus far his record was without\r\nblemish. As a lad of eighteen he sided with his uncle in the contest\r\nover the Federal Constitution; but once it became the supreme law of\r\nthe land he gave it early and vigorous support, not even soiling his\r\ncareer by a vote for the Kentucky resolutions. Unlike the Livingstons,\r\nhe found little to commend in the controversy with Genet and the\r\nFrench, and in Jay's extra session of the Legislature he voted arms\r\nand appropriations to sustain the hands of the President and the\r\nhonour of the flag. But he condemned the trend of Federalism as\r\nunwise, unpatriotic, and dangerous to the liberty of the citizen and\r\nto the growth of the country; and with equal force he opposed the\r\ninfluence of the French Revolution, maintaining that deeds of violence\r\nwere unnecessary to startle the public into the knowledge that\r\nsuffering exists, and that bad laws and bad social conditions result\r\nin hunger and misery. If he had been a great orator he would have\r\ncharmed the conservatives who hated Federalism and dreaded Jacobinism.\r\nLike his uncle he spoke forcibly and with clearness, but without grace\r\nor eloquence; his writing, though correct in style and sufficiently\r\npolished, lacked the simplicity and the happy gift of picturesque\r\nphrase which characterised the letters of so many of the public men\r\nof that day. Yet he was a noble illustration of what may be\r\naccomplished by an indomitable will, backed by a fearless independence\r\nand a power to dominate people in spite of antagonism of great and\r\nsuccessful rivals.\r\n\r\nClinton was now only at the opening of his great career. Even at this\r\ntime his contemporaries seem to have made up their minds that he had a\r\ngreat career before him, and when he and Governor Jay met as members\r\nof the new Council of Appointment, on February 11, 1801, it was like\r\nGreek meeting Greek. If Jay was the mildest mannered man in the State,\r\nhe was also one of the firmest; and on this occasion he did not\r\nhesitate to claim the exclusive right of nomination for office as had\r\nGovernor Clinton in 1794. Clinton, on the other hand, following the\r\ncourse pursued by Philip Schuyler, boldly and persistently claimed a\r\nconcurrent right on the part of the senatorial members. The break came\r\nwhen Jay nominated several Federalists for sheriff of Orange County,\r\nall of whom were rejected. Then Clinton made a nomination. Instead of\r\nputting the question Jay made a further nomination, on which the\r\nCouncil refused to vote. This ended the session. Jay asked for time to\r\nconsider, and never again convened the Council; but two days later he\r\nsent a message to the Assembly, reviewing the situation and asking its\r\nadvice. He also requested the opinion of the Chancellor and the\r\nSupreme Court Judges. The Assembly replied that it was a\r\nconstitutional question for the Governor and the Council; the Judges\r\ndeclined to express an opinion on the ground that it was\r\nextra-judicial. Three weeks later Clinton, Spencer, and Roseboom\r\nreported to the Assembly, with some show of bitterness, that they had\r\nsimply followed the precedent of Egbert Benson's appointment to the\r\nSupreme Court in 1794, an appointment, it will be remembered, which\r\nwas made on the nomination of Philip Schuyler and confirmed, over the\r\nprotest of Governor Clinton, by a majority of the Council.\r\n\r\nJay's failure to reconvene the Council seemed to gratify Clinton--if,\r\nindeed, his action had not been deliberately taken to provoke the\r\nGovernor into such a course. Appointments made under such conditions\r\ncould scarcely satisfy an ambitious leader who had friends to reward;\r\nand, besides, the election of a new governor in the following month\r\nwould enable him to appoint a corps of men willing to do the bidding\r\nof their new master. On the other hand, Governor Jay closed his\r\nofficial career as he began it. His first address to the Legislature\r\ndiscovered an intention of adhering to the dogmas of civil service,\r\nand so far as directly responsible he seems to have maintained the\r\nprinciple of dismissing no one for political reasons.\r\n\r\nThe closing days of Jay's public life included an act for the gradual\r\nabolition of domestic slavery. It cannot be called an important\r\nfeature of his administration, since Jay was entitled to little credit\r\nfor bringing it about. Although he had been a friend of emancipation,\r\nand as president of an anti-slavery society had characterised slavery\r\nas an evil of \"criminal dye,\" his failure to recommend emancipation in\r\nhis messages emphasises the suggestion that he was governed by the\r\nfear of its influence upon his future political career. However this\r\nmay be, it is certain that he resigned the presidency of the abolition\r\nsociety at the moment of his aroused ambition immediately preceding\r\nhis nomination for governor in 1792. His son explains that the people\r\nof the State did not favour abolition; yet the reform apparently\r\nneeded only the vigorous assistance of the Governor, for in 1798 a\r\nmeasure similar to the act of 1799 failed in the Assembly only by the\r\ncasting vote of the chairman in committee of the whole.\r\n\r\nOne thing, though, may be assumed, that a man so animated by high\r\nprinciples as John Jay must have felt amply justified in taking the\r\ncourse he did. Of all distinguished New Yorkers in the formative\r\nperiod of the government, John Jay, perhaps, possessed in fullest\r\nmeasure the resplendent gifts that immortalise Hamilton. Nevertheless,\r\nit was the purity of his life, the probity of his actions, the\r\nexcellence of his public purposes, that commended him to the\r\naffectionate regard of everybody. \"It was never said of him,\" wrote\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, \"that he had a language official and a language\r\nconfidential.\" During a political career of eight and twenty years, if\r\nhe ever departed from the highest ideal of an irreproachable\r\nuprightness of character, it is not of record. His work was\r\ncriticised, often severely, at times justly, but his character for\r\nhonesty and goodness continued to the end without blemish.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say in what field Jay did the best work. He\r\nexcelled in whatever he undertook. He had poise, forcefulness,\r\nmoderation, moral earnestness, and mental clearness. Whether at home\r\nor abroad the country knew his abiding place; for his well-doing\r\nmarked his whereabouts as plainly as smoke on a prairie indicates the\r\npresence of a camp. He has been called the draftsman of the\r\nContinental Congress, the constitution-maker of New York, the\r\nnegotiator of the peace treaty, and dictator under the Confederation,\r\nand he came very near being all that such designations imply. In a\r\nword, it may be said that what George Washington was in the field, in\r\ncouncil, and as President, John Jay was in legislative halls, in\r\ndiplomatic circles, and as a jurist.\r\n\r\nThe crowning act of his life was undoubtedly the peace treaty of 1783.\r\nBut great as was this diplomatic triumph he lived long enough to\r\nrealise that the failure to include Canada within the young Republic's\r\ndomain was ground for just criticism. In his note to Richard Oswald,\r\npreliminary to any negotiations, Franklin suggested the cession of\r\nCanada in token \"of a durable peace and a sweet reconciliation,\"\r\nhaving in mind England's desire that loyalists in America be restored\r\nto their rights. This was one of the three essentials to peace, and to\r\nmeet it Franklin's note proposed that compensation be paid these\r\nloyalists out of the sale of Canada's public lands. Subsequent\r\nrevelations made it fairly certain that had such cession, with its\r\nconcessions to the loyalists, been firmly pressed, Canada would have\r\nbecome American territory. Why it was not urged remains a secret.\r\nThere is no evidence that Franklin ever brought his suggestion to\r\nOswald to the attention of Jay,[118] but it is a source of deep regret\r\nthat Jay's profound sagacity did not include a country whose existence\r\nas a foreign colony on our northern border has given rise to continued\r\nembarrassment. The feeling involuntarily possesses one that he, who\r\nowned the nerve to stop all negotiations until Englishman and American\r\nmet on equal terms as the representatives of equal nations, and dared\r\nto break the specific instructions of Congress when he believed France\r\nfavoured confining the United States between the Atlantic and the\r\nAlleghanies, would have had the temerity to take Canada, had the great\r\nforesight been his to discern the irritating annoyances to which its\r\nindependence would subject us.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: \"Mr. Oswald returned to Paris on the fourth of May\r\n(1782), having been absent sixteen days; during which Dr. Franklin\r\ninformed each of his colleagues of what had occurred--Mr. Jay, at\r\nMadrid, Mr. Adams, in Holland--Mr. Laurens, on parole, in\r\nLondon.\"--James Parton, _Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin_, Vol. 2,\r\np. 461. Franklin wrote to Adams and Laurens on April 20, suggesting\r\nthat he had \"hinted that, if England should make us a voluntary offer\r\nof Canada, expressly for that purpose, it might have a good effect.\"\r\n_Works of Franklin_ (Sparks), Vol. 9, pp. 253-256. But his letter to\r\nJay simply urged the latter's coming to Paris at once. _Works of\r\nFranklin_ (Bigelow), Vol. 8, p. 48. Also, _Works of Franklin_\r\n(Sparks), Vol. 9, p. 254.]\r\n\r\nJay's brief tenure of the chief-justiceship of the United States\r\nSupreme Court gave little opportunity to test his real ability as a\r\njurist. The views expressed by him pending the adoption and\r\nratification of the Federal Constitution characterised his judicial\r\ninterpretation of that instrument, and he lived long enough to see his\r\ndoctrine well established that \"government proceeds directly from the\r\npeople, and is ordained and established in the name of the people.\"\r\nHis distinguishing trait as chief justice was the capacity to\r\nconfront, wisely and successfully, the difficulties of any situation\r\nby his own unaided powers of mind, but it is doubtful if the Court,\r\nunder his continued domination, would have acquired the strength and\r\npublic confidence given it by John Marshall. Jay believed that \"under\r\na system so defective it would not obtain the energy, weight, and\r\ndignity essential to its affording due support to the general\r\ngovernment.\" This was one reason for his declining to return to the\r\noffice after he ceased to be governor; he felt his inability to\r\naccomplish what the Court must establish, if the United States\r\ncontinued to grow into a world power. Under these circumstances, it\r\nwas well, perhaps, that he gave place to John Marshall, who made it a\r\ngreat, supporting pillar, strong enough to resist state supremacy on\r\nthe one side, and a disregard of the rights of States on the other;\r\nbut Jay did more than enough to confirm the wisdom of Washington, who\r\ndeclared that in making the appointment he exercised his \"best\r\njudgment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSPOILS AND BROILS OF VICTORY\r\n\r\n1801-1803\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Jay, tired of public life, now sought his Westchester farm to\r\nenjoy the rest of an honourable retirement, leaving the race for\r\ngovernor in April, 1801, to Stephen Van Rensselaer. On the other hand,\r\nGeorge Clinton, accepting the Republican nomination, got onto his\r\ngouty legs and made the greatest run of his life.[119] Outside of New\r\nEngland, Federalism had become old-fashioned in a year. Following\r\nJefferson's sweeping social success, men abandoned knee breeches and\r\nbecame democratic in garb as well as in thought. Henceforth, New York\r\nFederalists were to get nothing except through bargains and an\r\noccasional capture of the Council of Appointment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: George Clinton, 24,808; Stephen Van Rensselaer,\r\n20,843.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nThe election of George Clinton gave the party of Jefferson entire\r\ncontrol of the State. It had the governor, the Legislature, and the\r\nCouncil of Appointment. It only remained to empower the Council to\r\nnominate as well as to confirm, and the boss system, begun in 1794,\r\nwould have the sanction of law. For this purpose delegates, elected by\r\nthe people, met at Albany on the 13th of October, 1801, and organised\r\na constitutional convention by the election of Aaron Burr as\r\npresident. Fortune had thus far been very good to Burr. At forty-five\r\nhe stood one step only below the highest place in the nation, and now\r\nby a unanimous vote he became president of the second constitutional\r\nconvention of the Empire State. His position was certainly imposing,\r\nbut when the convention declared, as it did, that each member of the\r\nCouncil had the right to nominate as well as to confirm, Burr sealed\r\nDeWitt Clinton's power to overthrow and humiliate him.\r\n\r\nIn its uncompromising character DeWitt Clinton's dislike of Burr\r\nresembled Hamilton's, although for entirely different reasons.\r\nHamilton thought him a dangerous man, guided neither by patriotism nor\r\nprinciple, who might at any moment throttle constitutional government\r\nand set up a dictatorship after the manner of Napoleon. Clinton's\r\nhostility arose from the jealousy of an ambitious rival who saw no\r\nroom in New York for two Republican bosses. Accordingly, when the\r\nCouncil, which Jay had refused to reassemble, reconvened under the\r\nsummons of Governor Clinton, it quickly disclosed the policy of\r\ndestroying Burr and satisfying the Livingstons.[120] President\r\nJefferson had already sent the Chancellor to France, and the\r\nLegislature had made John Armstrong, his brother-in-law, a United\r\nStates senator. But enough of the Chancellor's family remained to fill\r\nother important offices, and the Council made Edward, a brother, mayor\r\nof New York; Thomas Tillotson, a brother-in-law, secretary of state;\r\nMorgan Lewis, a fourth brother-in-law, chief justice, and Brockholst\r\nLivingston, a cousin, justice of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: \"Young DeWitt Clinton and his friend Ambrose Spencer\r\ncontrolled this Council, and they were not persons who affected\r\nscruple in matters of political self-interest. They swept the\r\nFederalists out of every office even down to that of auctioneer, and\r\nwithout regard to appearances, even against the protests of the\r\nGovernor, installed their own friends and family connections in\r\npower.\"--Henry Adams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 1, pp. 228,\r\n229. \"DeWitt Clinton was hardly less responsible than Burr himself for\r\nlowering the standard of New York politics, and indirectly that of the\r\nnation.\"--_Ibid._, p. 112.]\r\n\r\nOut of the spoils that remained, and there was an abundance, DeWitt\r\nClinton and Ambrose Spencer helped themselves; and then they divided\r\nthe balance between their relatives and supporters. Sylvanus Miller,\r\nan ardent and lifelong friend of the former, became surrogate of New\r\nYork; Elisha Jenkins, who deserted the Federalists in company with\r\nSpencer, took John V. Henry's place as state comptroller; Richard\r\nRiker, the friend and second of Clinton in his famous duel with John\r\nSwartout, became district attorney in place of Cadwallader D. Colden,\r\na worthy grandson of \"Old Silver Locks,\" the distinguished colonial\r\nlieutenant-governor; John McKisson, a protégé of Spencer, took the\r\nclerkship of the Circuit Court from William Coleman, subsequently the\r\nbrilliant editor of the _Evening Post_, established by Jay and\r\nHamilton; and William Stewart, a brother-in-law of George Clinton,\r\ndisplaced Nathan W. Howell as assistant attorney-general. Thus the\r\nwork of the political guillotine went on. It took sheriffs and\r\nsurrogates; it spared neither county clerks nor justices of the peace;\r\nit left not a mayor of a city, nor a judge of a county. Even the\r\nresidence of an appointee did not control. Sylvanus Miller of Ulster\r\nwas made surrogate of New York with as much disregard of the people's\r\nwishes as Ruggles Hubbard of Rensselaer, who had visited the city but\r\ntwice and knew nothing of its people or its life, was afterward made\r\nits sheriff.\r\n\r\nWhen Clinton and Spencer finished their work a single Federalist,\r\nJosiah Ogden Hoffman, the attorney-general, remained in office, and he\r\nsurvived only until Ambrose Spencer could take his place. Soon\r\nafterward Spencer was advanced to the Supreme Court in place of Jacob\r\nRadcliff, a promotion that filled Federalists with the greatest alarm.\r\nLooking back upon the distinguished career of Chief Justice Spencer,\r\nit seems strange, almost ridiculous, in fact, that his appointment to\r\nthe bench should have given rise to such fears; but Spencer had been\r\nthe rudest, most ferocious opponent of all. The Federalists were\r\nafraid of him because they believed with William P. Van Ness, the\r\nyoung friend of Burr, that he was \"governed by no principles or\r\nfeelings except those which avarice and unprincipled ambition\r\ninspired.\"[121] Van Ness wrote with a pen dipped in gall, yet, if\r\ncontemporary criticism be accepted, he did not exaggerate the feeling\r\nentertained for Spencer by the Federalists of that day. Like DeWitt\r\nClinton, he was a bad hater, often insolent, sometimes haughty, and\r\nalways arbitrary. After he left the Federalist party and became a\r\nmember of the celebrated Council of 1801, he seemed over-zealous in\r\nhis support of the men he had recently persecuted, and unnecessarily\r\nsevere in his treatment of former associates. \"The animosity of the\r\napostate,\" said Van Ness, \"cannot be controlled. Savage and\r\nrelentless, he thirsts for vengeance. Such is emphatically the temper\r\nof Ambrose Spencer, who, after his conversion, was introduced to a\r\nseat in the Legislature, by his new friends, for the express purpose\r\nof perplexing and persecuting his old ones.\"[122] Spencer never got\r\nover being a violent partisan, but he was an impartial, honest judge.\r\nThe strength of his intellect no one disputed, and if his political\r\naffiliations seemed to warp his judgment in affairs of state, it was\r\nnone the less impartial and enlightened when brought to bear on\r\ndifficult questions of law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: _Letters of \"Aristides\"_, p. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: _Letters of \"Aristides\"_, p. 42.]\r\n\r\nThe timely resignation of John Armstrong from the United States Senate\r\nmade room for DeWitt Clinton, who, however, a year later, resigned the\r\nsenatorship to become mayor of New York. The inherent strength of the\r\nUnited States Senate rested, then as now, upon its constitutional\r\nendowment, but the small body of men composing it, having\r\ncomparatively little to do and doing that little by general assent,\r\nwith no record of their debates, evidently did not appreciate that it\r\nwas the most powerful single chamber in any legislative body in the\r\nworld. It is doubtful if the framers of the Constitution recognised\r\nthe enormous power they had given it. Certainly DeWitt Clinton and his\r\nresigning colleagues did not appreciate that the combination of its\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial functions would one day\r\npractically dominate the Executive and the Congress, for the reason\r\nthat its members are the constitutional advisers of the President,\r\nwithout whose assent no bill can become a law, no office can be\r\nfilled, no officer of the government impeached, and no treaty made\r\noperative.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of the United States Senate, Clinton probably gave\r\nlittle thought to the character of the place, whether it was a step up\r\nor a step down to the mayoralty. Just then he was engaged in the\r\npolitical annihilation of Aaron Burr, and he felt the necessity of\r\nentering the latter's stronghold to deprive him of influence. Out of\r\nsix or seven thousand appointments made by the Council of Appointment\r\nnot a friend of Aaron Burr got so much as the smallest crumb from the\r\nwell-filled table. Even Burr himself, and his friend, John Swartout,\r\nwere forced from the directorate of the Manhattan Bank that Burr had\r\norganised. \"With astonishment,\" wrote William P. Van Ness, \"it was\r\nobserved that no man, however virtuous, however unspotted his life or\r\nhis fame, could be advanced to the most unimportant appointment,\r\nunless he would submit to abandon all intercourse with Mr. Burr, vow\r\nopposition to his elevation, and like a feudal vassal pledge his\r\npersonal services to traduce his character and circulate\r\nslander.\"[123]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: _Letters of \"Aristides\"_, p. 69.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Clinton feebly opposed this wholesale slaughter by refusing\r\nto sign the minutes of the Council and by making written protests\r\nagainst its methods; but greater emphasis would doubtless have availed\r\nno more, since the constitutional convention had reduced the governor\r\nto the merest figurehead. His one vote out of five limited the extent\r\nof his prerogative. Power existed in the combine only, and so well did\r\nDeWitt Clinton control that when the famous Council of 1801 had\r\nfinished its work nothing remained for succeeding Councils to do until\r\nClinton, the prototype of the party boss, returned in 1806 to crush\r\nthe Livingstons.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a decapitated office-holder fiercely resented the\r\nCouncil's action, and, to make it sting the more, complimented the\r\nGovernor for his patriotic and unselfish opposition. John V. Henry\r\nevidenced his disgust by ever after declining public office, though\r\nhis party had opportunities of recognising his great ability and\r\nrewarding his fidelity. Ebenezer Foote, a bright lawyer, who took his\r\nremoval from the clerkship of Delaware County very much to heart,\r\nopened fire on Ambrose Spencer, charging him with base and unworthy\r\nmotives in separating from the Federalists. To this Spencer replied\r\nwith characteristic rhetoric. \"Your removal was an act of justice to\r\nthe public, inasmuch as the veriest hypocrite and the most malignant\r\nvillain in the State was deprived of the power of perpetuating\r\nmischief. If, as you insinuate, your interests have by your removal\r\nbeen materially affected, then, sir, like many men more honest than\r\nyourself, earn your bread by the sweat of your brow.\"[124]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n1, p. 177.]\r\n\r\nAt Washington, Jefferson had rewarded friends as openly as DeWitt\r\nClinton took care of them in Albany. In telling the story, James A.\r\nBayard of Delaware produced an oratorical sensation in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. \"And now, sir, let me ask the honourable gentleman,\"\r\nsaid the congressman, in reply to William Giles' defence of the\r\nVirginia President, \"what his reflections and belief will be when he\r\nobserves that every man on whose vote the event of Mr. Jefferson's\r\nelection hung has since been distinguished by presidential favour. Mr.\r\nCharles Pinckney of South Carolina was one of the most active,\r\nefficient and successful promoters of the election of the present\r\nchief magistrate, and he has since been appointed minister\r\nplenipotentiary to the court of Madrid--an appointment as high and\r\nhonourable as any within the gift of the Executive. I know what was\r\nthe value of the vote of Mr. Claiborne of Tennessee; the vote of a\r\nState was in his hands. Mr. Claiborne has since been raised to the\r\nhigh dignity of governor of the Mississippi Territory. I know how\r\ngreat, and how greatly felt, was the importance of the vote of Mr.\r\nLinn of New Jersey. The delegation of the State consists of five\r\nmembers; two of the delegation were decidedly for Mr. Jefferson, two\r\nwere decidedly for Mr. Burr. Mr. Linn was considered as inclining to\r\none side, but still doubtful; both parties looked up to him for the\r\nvote of New Jersey. He gave it to Mr. Jefferson; and Mr. Linn has\r\nsince had the profitable office of supervisor of his district\r\nconferred upon him. Mr. Lyon of Vermont was in this instance an\r\nimportant man; he neutralised the vote of Vermont; his absence alone\r\nwould have given the State to Mr. Burr. It was too much to give an\r\noffice to Mr. Lyon; his character was low; but Mr. Lyon's son has been\r\nhandsomely provided for in one of the executive offices. I shall add\r\nto the catalogue but the name of one more gentleman, Mr. Edward\r\nLivingston of New York. I knew well--full well I knew--the consequence\r\nof this gentleman. His means were not limited to his own vote; nay, I\r\nalways considered more than the vote of New York within his power. Mr.\r\nLivingston has been made the attorney for the district of New York;\r\nthe road of preferment has been opened to him, and his brother has\r\nbeen raised to the distinguished place of minister plenipotentiary to\r\nthe French Republic.\"[125]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Henry Adams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 1,\r\npp. 294-5.]\r\n\r\nAlbert Gallatin, Jefferson's secretary of the treasury, thought Burr\r\nless selfish than either the Clintons or the Livingstons, and, on the\r\nscore of office-seeking, Gallatin was probably correct. But Burr, if\r\nwithout relatives, had several devoted friends whom he pressed for\r\nappointment, among them John Swartout for marshal, Daniel Gelston for\r\ncollector, Theodorus Bailey for naval officer, and Matthew L. Davis\r\nfor supervisor. Swartout succeeded, but DeWitt Clinton, getting wind\r\nof the scheme, entered an heroic protest to Jefferson, who quickly\r\nconcurred in Clinton's wishes without so much as a conference with\r\nGallatin or Burr. The latter, hearing rumours of the secret\r\nunderstanding, sent a sharp letter to Gallatin, pressing Davis'\r\nappointment on the ground of good faith, with a threat that he would\r\nno longer be trifled with; but Gallatin was helpless as well as\r\nignorant, and the President silent. Davis' journey to Monticello\r\ndeveloped nothing but Jefferson's insincerity, and on his return to\r\nNew York the press laughed at his credulity.\r\n\r\nThis ended Burr's pretended loyalty to the Administration. On his\r\nreturn to Washington, in January, 1802, he quietly watched his\r\nopportunity, and two weeks later gave the casting vote which sent\r\nJefferson's pet measure, the repeal of the judiciary act of 1801, to a\r\nselect committee for delay, instead of to the President for approval.\r\nSoon after, at a Federalist banquet celebrating Washington's birthday,\r\nBurr proposed the toast, \"The union of all honest men.\" This was the\r\nfatal stab. The country didn't understand it, but to Jefferson and the\r\nClintons it meant all that Burr intended, and from that moment DeWitt\r\nClinton's newspaper, the _American Citizen and Watchtower_, owned by\r\nhis cousin and edited by James Cheetham, an English refugee, took up\r\nthe challenge thus thrown down, and began its famous attack upon the\r\nVice President.\r\n\r\nBurr's conduct during those momentous weeks when Federalists did their\r\nutmost to make him President, gave his rivals ample ground for\r\ncreating the belief that he had evidenced open contempt for the\r\nprinciples of honest dealing. Had he published a letter after the\r\nFederalists decided to support him, condemning their policy as a\r\nconspiracy to deprive the people of their choice for President, and\r\nrefusing to accept an election at their hands if tendered him, it must\r\nhave disarmed his critics and smoothed his pathway to further\r\npolitical preferment; but his failure so to act, coupled with his\r\nwell-known behaviour and the activity of his friends, gave opponents\r\nan advantage that skill and ability were insufficient to overcome.\r\n\r\nJames Cheetham handled his pen like a bludgeon. Even at this distance\r\nof time Cheetham's \"View of Aaron Burr's Political Conduct,\" in which\r\nis traced the Vice President's alleged intrigues to promote himself\r\nover Jefferson, is interesting and exciting. Despite its bitter\r\nsarcasm and torrent of vituperation, Cheetham's array of facts and\r\ndates, the designation of persons and places, and the bold assumptions\r\nbased on apparent knowledge, backed by foot-notes that promised\r\nabsolute proof if denial were made, impress one strongly. There is\r\nmuch that is weak, much that is only suspicion, much that is fanciful.\r\nA visit to an uncle in Connecticut, a call upon the governor of Rhode\r\nIsland, a communication sent under cover to another, letters in\r\ncipher, pleasant notices in Federalist newspapers, a journey of\r\nTimothy Green to South Carolina--all these belong to the realm of\r\ninference; but the method of blending them with well established facts\r\nwas so artful, the writer's sincerity so apparent, and the strokes of\r\nthe pen so bold and positive, that it is easy to understand the effect\r\nwhich Cheetham's accusation, taken up and ceaselessly repeated by\r\nother papers, would have upon the political fortunes of Burr.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the Vice President remained silent. He did not feel, or\r\nseem to feel, newspaper criticism with the acuteness of a sensitive\r\nnature trying to do right. \"They are so utterly lost on me that I\r\nshould never have seen even this,\" he wrote Theodosia, \"but that it\r\ncame inclosed to me in a letter from New York.\" Still Cheetham kept\r\nhis battery at work. After his \"Narrative\" came the \"View,\" and then,\r\nin 1803, \"Nine Letters on the Subject of Burr's Defection,\" a heavier\r\nvolume, a sort of siege-gun, brought up to penetrate an epidermis\r\nheretofore apparently impregnable. Finally, the Albany _Register_ took\r\nup the matter, followed by other Republican papers, until their\r\npurpose to drive the grandson of Jonathan Edwards from the party could\r\nno longer be mistaken.[126]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: \"All the world knew that not Cheetham, but DeWitt\r\nClinton, thus dragged the Vice President from his chair, and that not\r\nBurr's vices but his influence made his crimes heinous; that behind\r\nDeWitt Clinton stood the Virginia dynasty, dangling Burr's office in\r\nthe eyes of the Clinton family, and lavishing honours and money on the\r\nLivingstons. All this was as clear to Burr and his friends as though\r\nit was embodied in an Act of Congress.\"--Henry Adams, _History of the\r\nUnited States_, Vol. 1, pp. 331, 332.]\r\n\r\nBurr's coterie of devoted friends so understood it, and when the\r\ngentle Peter Irving, whose younger brother was helping the newly\r\nestablished _Chronicle_ into larger circulation by his Jonathan\r\nOldstyle essays, showed an indisposition as editor of the Burrite\r\npaper to vituperate and lampoon in return, William P. Van Ness, the\r\nfamous and now historic \"Aristides,\" appeared in the political\r\nfirmament with the suddenness and brilliancy of a comet that dims the\r\nlight of stars.\r\n\r\nVan Ness coupled real literary ability with political audacity,\r\nputting Cheetham's fancy flights and inferences to sleep as if they\r\nwere babes in the woods. It was quickly seen that Cheetham was no\r\nmatch for him. He had neither the finish nor the venom. Compared to\r\nthe sentences of \"Aristides,\" as polished and attractive as they were\r\nbitter and ill-tempered, Cheetham's periods seemed coarse and tame.\r\nThe letters of Junius did not make themselves felt in English\r\npolitical life more than did this pamphlet in the political circles of\r\nNew York. It was novel, it was brilliantly able, and it drove the\r\nknife deeper and surer than its predecessors. What Taine, the great\r\nFrench writer, said of Junius might with equal truth be said of\r\n\"Aristides,\" that if he made his phrases and selected his epithets, it\r\nwas not from the love of style, but in order the better to stamp his\r\ninsult. No one knew then, nor until long afterward, who \"Aristides\"\r\nwas--not even Cheetham could pierce the _incognito_; but every one\r\nknew that upon him the full mind of Aaron Burr had unloaded a volume\r\nof information respecting men, their doings and sayings, which\r\nenriched the work and made his rhetoric an instrument of torture. It\r\nbristled with history and character sketches. Whatever the Vice\r\nPresident knew, or thought he knew, was poured into those eighty pages\r\nwith a staggering fulness and disregard of consequences that startled\r\nthe political world and captivated all lovers of the brilliant and\r\nsensational in literature. Confidences were revealed, conversations\r\nmade public, quarrels uncovered, political secrets given up, and the\r\ngossip of Council and Legislature churned into a story that pleased\r\nevery one. What Hamilton's attack on Adams did for Federalists,\r\n\"Aristides'\" reply to Cheetham did for the Republicans; but the latter\r\nwrote with a ferocity unknown to the pages of the great Federalist's\r\nunfortunate letter.\r\n\r\n\"Aristides\" struck at everybody and missed no one. The Governor \"has\r\ndwindled into the mere instrument of an ambitious relative;\"\r\nTillotson was \"a contemptible shuffling apothecary, without ingenuity\r\nor devise, or spirit to pursue any systematic plan of iniquity;\"\r\nRichard Riker was \"an imbecile and obsequious pettifogger, a vain and\r\ncontemptible little pest, who abandoned the Federal standard on the\r\nthird day of the election, in April, 1800;\" John McKisson, \"an\r\nexecrable compound of every species of vice,\" was the man whom Clinton\r\n\"exultingly declared a great scoundrel.\" The attack thus daringly\r\nbegun was steadily maintained. Ambrose Spencer was \"a man as\r\nnotoriously infamous as the legitimate offspring of treachery and\r\nfraud can possibly be;\" Samuel Osgood, \"a born hypocrite, propagated\r\nfalsehood for the purpose of slander and imposition;\" Chancellor\r\nLivingston, \"a capricious, visionary theorist,\" was \"lamentably\r\ndeficient in the practical knowledge of a politician, and heedless of\r\nimportant and laborious pursuits, at which his frivolous mind\r\nrevolted.\"\r\n\r\nThe greatest interest of the pamphlet, however, began when\r\n\"Aristides,\" taking up the cause of Burr, struck at higher game than\r\nRichard Riker or Ambrose Spencer. DeWitt Clinton was portrayed as\r\n\"formed for mischief,\" \"inflated with vanity,\" \"cruel by nature,\" \"an\r\nobject of derision and disgust,\" \"a dissolute and desperate\r\nintriguer,\" \"an adept in moral turpitude, skilled in all the\r\ncombination of treachery and fraud, with a mind matured by the\r\npractice of iniquity, and unalloyed with any virtuous principle.\" \"Was\r\nit not disgraceful to political controversy,\" continues \"Aristides,\"\r\nwith an audacity of denunciation and sternness of animosity, \"I would\r\ndevelop the dark and gloomy disorders of his malignant bosom, and\r\ntrace each convulsive vibration of his wicked heart. He may justly be\r\nranked among those, who, though destitute of sound understandings, are\r\nstill rendered dangerous to society by the intrinsic baseness of\r\ncharacter that engenders hatred to everything good and valuable in the\r\nworld; who, with barbarous malignity, view the prevalence of moral\r\nprinciples, and the extension of benevolent designs; who, foes to\r\nvirtue, seek the subversion of every valuable institution, and\r\nmeditate the introduction of wild and furious disorders among the\r\nsupporters of public virtue. His intimacy with men who have long since\r\ndisowned all regard to decency and have become the daring advocates of\r\nevery species of atrocity; his indissoluble connection with those,\r\nwho, by their lives, have become the finished examples of profligacy\r\nand corruption; who have sworn enmity, severe and eternal, to the\r\naltar of our religion and the prosperity of our government, must\r\ninfallibly exclude him from the confidence of reputable men. What\r\nsentiments can be entertained for him, but those of hatred and\r\ncontempt, when he is seen the constant associate of a man whose name\r\nhas become synonymous with vice, a dissolute and fearless assassin of\r\nprivate character, of domestic comfort, and of social happiness; when\r\nhe is known to be the bosom friend and supporter of the profligate and\r\nabandoned libertine, who, from the vulgar debauches of night, hastens\r\nagain to the invasion of private property. Who, through the robbery of\r\nthe public revenue, and the violation of private seals, hurries down\r\nthe precipice of deep and desperate villainy.\"\r\n\r\nThis parting shot at Cheetham penetrated the most secret corners of\r\nprivate life, and leaves an impression that Cicero's denunciation of\r\nCatiline had delighted the youth of \"Aristides.\" It would be fruitless\r\nto attempt the separation of the truth from the undeserved reproaches\r\nof Van Ness, but at the end of the discussion, Burr's character had\r\nnot benefited. However unscrupulous and selfish the Clintons and the\r\nLivingstons might be, Burr's unprincipled conduct was fixed in the\r\nmind of his party, not by Cheetham's indulgence in fancy and\r\ninference, but by the well known and well established facts of\r\nhistory, which no rhetoric could wipe out, and no denunciation\r\nstrengthen.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the duello such a war of words could hardly go on for\r\ntwo or three years without a resort to the pistol. Cheetham's pen had\r\nstirred up the tongues of men who resented charge with countercharge,\r\nand the high spirited United States marshal, John Swartout, the only\r\nfriend of Burr in office, was quick to declare that DeWitt Clinton's\r\nopposition to the Vice President was based upon unworthy and selfish\r\nmotives. Clinton answered promptly and passionately. The Governor's\r\nnephew displayed a fondness for indulging the use of epithets even in\r\nmature years, after he had quarrelled with William L. Marcy and Martin\r\nVan Buren. In those calmer days when age is supposed to bring a desire\r\nfor peace, he was accustomed to call Erastus Root \"a bad man,\" Samuel\r\nYoung \"much of an imbecile,\" Marcy \"a scoundrel,\" and Van Buren \"the\r\nprince of villains.\" Just now, however, Clinton was younger, only\r\nthirty-two years old, about the age of Swartout, and on hearing of the\r\nlatter's criticism he trebled his epithets, pronouncing him \"a liar, a\r\nscoundrel and a villain.\" Swartout quickly demanded a retraction,\r\nwhich Clinton declined unless the Marshal first withdrew his offensive\r\nwords. Thereupon, the latter sent a challenge, and Clinton, calling in\r\nhis friend, Richard Riker, the district attorney, met his adversary\r\nthe next day at Weehawken and exchanged three shots without effect. On\r\nthe fourth Clinton's bullet struck Swartout's left leg just below the\r\nknee, and while the surgeon was cutting it out, the Marshal renewed\r\nhis demand for an apology. Clinton still refused, although expressing\r\nentire willingness to shake hands and drop the matter. On the fifth\r\nshot, the Marshal caught Clinton's ball in the same leg just above the\r\nankle. Still standing steadily at his post and perfectly composed,\r\nSwartout demanded further satisfaction; but Clinton, tired of filling\r\nhis antagonist with lead, declined to shoot again and left the field.\r\nIn the gossip following the duel, Riker reported Clinton as saying in\r\nthe course of the contest, \"I wish I had the principal here.\"[127] The\r\nprincipal, of course, was Burr, to whose house the wounded Swartout\r\nwas taken. \"No one ever explained,\" says Henry Adams,[128] \"why Burr\r\ndid not drag DeWitt Clinton from his ambush and shoot him, as two\r\nyears later he shot Alexander Hamilton with less provocation.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Henry Adams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n332.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: _Ibid._, 332.\r\n\r\nWriting to Henry Post of the duel, Clinton (using the name, \"Clinton,\"\r\ninstead of the pronoun \"I\") said: \"The affair of the duel ought not to\r\nbe brought up. It was a silly affair. Clinton ought to have declined\r\nthe challenge of the bully, and have challenged the principal, who was\r\nBurr. There were five shots, the antagonist wounded twice, and fell.\r\nC. behaved with cool courage, and after the affair was over challenged\r\nBurr on the field.\"--_Harper's Magazine_, Vol. 50, p. 565. \"How\r\nClinton should have challenged Burr on the field,\" writes John\r\nBigelow, in _Harper's New Monthly Magazine_ for May, 1875, \"without\r\nits resulting in a meeting is not quite intelligible to us now. Though\r\nnot much given to the redress of personal grievances in that way, Burr\r\nwas the last man to leave a hostile message from an adversary like\r\nClinton, then a Senator of the United States, unanswered.\"]\r\n\r\nOut of this quarrel grew another, in which Robert Swartout, John's\r\nyounger brother, fought Riker, wounding him severely. William Coleman\r\nof the _Evening Post_, in letting fly some poisoned arrows, also got\r\ntangled up with Cheetham. \"Lie on Duane, lie on for pay, and Cheetham,\r\nlie thou too; more against truth you cannot say, than truth can say\r\n'gainst you.\" The spicy epigrams ended in a challenge, but Cheetham\r\nmade such haste to adjust matters that a report got abroad of his\r\nhaving shown the white feather. Harbour-Master Thompson, an appointee\r\nof Clinton, now championed Cheetham's cause, declaring that Coleman\r\nhad weakened. Immediately the young editor sent him a challenge, and,\r\nwithout much ado, they fought on the outskirts of the city, now the\r\nfoot of Twenty-first Street, in the twilight of a cold winter day,\r\nexchanging two shots without effect. Meantime, the growing darkness\r\ncompelled the determined combatants to move closer together, and at\r\nthe next shot Thompson, mortally wounded, fell forward into the\r\nsnow.[129]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: \"Thompson was brought,\" says William Cullen Bryant in\r\n_Reminiscences of the Evening Post_, \"to his sister's house in town;\r\nhe was laid at the door; the bell was rung; the family came out and\r\nfound him bleeding and near his death. He refused to name his\r\nantagonist, or give any account of the affair, declaring that\r\neverything which had been done was honourably done, and desired that\r\nno attempt should be made to seek out or molest his adversary.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF BURR AND DEATH OF HAMILTON\r\n\r\n1804\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaign for governor in 1804 was destined to become historic.\r\nBurr was driven from his party; George Clinton, ambitious to become\r\nVice President, declined re-election;[130] and the Federalists, beaten\r\ninto a disunited minority, refused to put up a candidate. This\r\napparently left the field wide open to John Lansing, with John Broome\r\nfor lieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: \"DeWitt Clinton was annoyed at his uncle's conduct, and\r\ntried to prevent the withdrawal by again calling Jefferson to his aid\r\nand alarming him with fear of Burr. But the President declined to\r\ninterfere. No real confidence ever existed between Jefferson and the\r\nClintons.\"--Henry Adams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 2, pp.\r\n173, 174.]\r\n\r\nFor many years the Lansing family had been prominent in the affairs of\r\nthe State and influential in the councils of their party. The\r\nChancellor, some years younger than Livingston, a large, handsome,\r\nmodest man, was endowed with a remarkable capacity for public life.\r\nThe story of his career is a story of rugged manhood and a tragic,\r\nmysterious death. He rose by successive steps to be mayor of Albany,\r\nmember of the Assembly of which he was twice speaker, member of\r\nCongress under the Confederation, judge and chief justice of the\r\nSupreme Court, and finally chancellor. Indeed, so long as he did the\r\nbidding of the Clintons he kept rising; but the independence that\r\nearly characterised his action at Philadelphia in 1787 and at\r\nPoughkeepsie in 1788 became more and more pronounced, until it\r\nseparated him at last from the faction that had steadily given him\r\nsupport. Perhaps his nearest approach to a splendid virtue was his\r\nstubborn independence. Whether this characteristic, amounting almost\r\nto stoical indifference, led to his murder is now a sealed secret. All\r\nthat we know of his death is, that he left the hotel, where he lived\r\nin New York, to mail a letter on the steamer for Albany, and was never\r\nafterward seen. That he was murdered comes from the lips of Thurlow\r\nWeed, who was intrusted with the particulars, but who died with the\r\nsecret untold. Lansing disappeared in 1829 and Weed died in 1882, yet,\r\nafter the lapse of half a century, the latter did not feel justified\r\nin disclosing what had come to him as a sort of father confessor,\r\nyears after the tragedy. \"While it is true that the parties are beyond\r\nthe reach of human tribunals and of public opinion,\" he said, \"yet\r\nothers immediately associated with them, and sharing in the strong\r\ninducement which prompted the crime, survive, occupying high positions\r\nand enjoying public confidence. To these persons, should my proof be\r\nsubmitted, public attention would be irresistibly drawn.\"[131]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n35.]\r\n\r\nLansing had the instinct, equipment, and training for a chancellor. It\r\nhas been truly said of him that he seemed to have no delights off the\r\nbench except in such things as in some way related to the business\r\nupon it. He had the unwearied application of Kent, coupled with the\r\nability to master the most difficult details, and, although he lacked\r\nLivingston's culture, he was as resolute, and, perhaps, as restless\r\nand suspicious; but it is doubtful if he possessed the trained\r\nsagacity, the native shrewdness, and the diplomatic zeal to have\r\nnegotiated the Louisiana treaty. Lansing began the study of law in\r\n1774, and from that moment was wedded to its principles and constant\r\nin his devotions. His mysterious murder must have been caused by an\r\nirresistible longing to trace things to their source, bringing into\r\nhis possession knowledge of some missing link or defective title,\r\nwhich would throw a great property away from its owner, but which, by\r\nhis death, would again be buried from the ken of men. This, of course,\r\nis only surmise; but Weed indicates that property prompted the crime,\r\nand that the heirs of the murderer profited by it. Lansing was in his\r\nseventy-sixth year when the fatal blow came, yet so vigorous that old\r\nage had not set its seal upon him.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 Lansing hesitated to exchange the highest place on the bench,\r\nwhich would continue until the age limit set him aside in 1814, for a\r\npolitical office that would probably end in three years; but he\r\nfinally consented upon representations that he alone could unite his\r\nparty. Scarcely, however, had his name been announced before a caucus\r\nof Republican legislators named Aaron Burr, with Oliver Phelps of\r\nOntario for lieutenant-governor--nominations quickly ratified at\r\npublic meetings in New York and Albany. Among Burr's most conspicuous\r\nchampions were Erastus Root of Delaware, James Burt of Orange, Peter\r\nB. Porter of Ontario, and Marinus Willett of New York.\r\n\r\nIf it is surprising that these astute and devoted friends did not\r\nappreciate, in some measure, at least, the extent to which popular\r\nesteem had been withdrawn from their favourite, it is most astonishing\r\nthat Burr himself did not recognise the strength of the\r\nClinton-Livingston-Spencer machine as it existed in 1804. Its managers\r\nwere skilled masters of the political art, confident of success,\r\nfearless of criticism, unscrupulous in methods, and indefatigable in\r\nattention to details. They controlled the Council of Appointment, its\r\nappointees controlled the Assembly, and the Assembly elected the\r\nCouncil, an endless chain of links, equally strong and equally\r\nselfish. To make opposition the more fruitless, the distrust of Burr,\r\nhammered into the masses by Cheetham's pen, practically amounted to a\r\nforfeiture of party confidence. One cannot conceive a more inopportune\r\ntime for Burr to have challenged a test of strength, yet Lansing's\r\nselection had hardly sounded in the people's ears before Burr's\r\n\"Little Band,\" burning with indignation and resentment at his\r\ntreatment, gathered about the tables in the old Tontine Coffee House\r\nat Albany and launched him as an independent candidate.\r\n\r\nRarely has a candidate for governor encountered greater odds; but with\r\nBurr, as afterward with DeWitt Clinton, it was now or never. In one of\r\nhis dramas Schiller mourns over the man who stakes reputation, health,\r\neverything upon success--and no success in the end. Even Robert Yates,\r\nthe coalition candidate in 1789, started with the support of a\r\nFederalist machine and the powerful backing of Hamilton. But in 1804\r\nBurr found himself without a party, without a machine, and bitterly\r\nopposed by Hamilton.\r\n\r\nWhen the sceptre passed from Federalist to Republican in 1801,\r\nHamilton gave himself to his profession with renewed zeal, earning\r\nfifteen thousand dollars a year, and a reputation as a lawyer scarcely\r\nsurpassed by Daniel Webster. \"In creative power Hamilton was\r\ninfinitely Webster's superior,\" says Chief Justice Ambrose Spencer,\r\nbefore whom both had practised.[132] Erastus Root, possibly looking\r\nthrough the eyes of Theodosia, thought Burr not inferior to Hamilton\r\nas a lawyer, although other contemporaries who knew Burr at his best,\r\nregarded him as an indefatigable, tireless, adroit lawyer rather than\r\na profound and learned one. This put him in a different class from\r\nHamilton. As well might one compare Offenbach with Mozart as Burr with\r\nHamilton.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: H.C. Lodge, _Life of Alexander Hamilton_, pp. 276-7.]\r\n\r\nHamilton journeyed to Albany in February, 1804, to argue the case of\r\nHarry Croswell, so celebrated and historic because of Hamilton's\r\nargument. Croswell, the editor of the _Balance_, a Federalist\r\nnewspaper published at Hudson, had been convicted of libelling\r\nPresident Jefferson. Chief Justice Lewis, before whom the case was\r\noriginally tried, declined to permit the defendant to prove the truth\r\nof the alleged libel. To this point, in his argument for a new trial,\r\nHamilton addressed himself, contending that the English doctrine was\r\nat variance with common sense, common justice, and the genius of\r\nAmerican institutions. \"I have always considered General Hamilton's\r\nargument in this cause,\" said his great contemporary, Chancellor Kent,\r\n\"as the greatest forensic effort he ever made. He had come prepared\r\nto discuss the points of law with a perfect mastery of the subject. He\r\nbelieved that the rights and liberties of the people were essentially\r\nconcerned. There was an unusual solemnity and earnestness on his part\r\nin this discussion. He was at times highly impassioned and pathetic.\r\nHis whole soul was enlisted in the cause, and in contending for the\r\nrights of the jury and a free press, he considered that he was\r\nestablishing the surest refuge against oppression. He never before in\r\nmy hearing made any effort in which he commanded higher reverence for\r\nhis principles, nor equal admiration of the power and pathos of his\r\neloquence.\"[133] Such a profound impression did his argument make,\r\nthat, although the Court declined to depart from the settled rule of\r\nthe common law, the Legislature subsequently passed a statute\r\nauthorising the truth to be given in evidence, and the jury to be the\r\njudges of the law as well as of the facts in libel cases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: H.C. Lodge, _Life of Alexander Hamilton_, pp. 240-1.]\r\n\r\nIt was during the argument of this case at Albany that Hamilton,\r\njoining his Federalist friends at Lewis' Tavern, gave his reasons for\r\npreferring Chancellor Lansing to Aaron Burr for governor. There was\r\nsomething new in these reasons. In 1801 he preferred Jefferson to Burr\r\nbecause the latter, as he wrote Gouverneur Morris, \"has no principles,\r\npublic or private; could be bound by no argument; will listen to no\r\nmonitor but his ambition; and for this purpose will use the worst\r\nportion of the community as a ladder to climb to permanent power, and\r\nan instrument to crush the better part. He is sanguine enough to hope\r\neverything, daring enough to attempt everything, wicked enough to\r\nscruple nothing.\"[134]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 570.]\r\n\r\nNothing had occurred in the intervening years to change this opinion,\r\nbut much was now happening to strengthen it. A Federalist faction in\r\nNew England, led by Pickering in the United States Senate and Roger\r\nGriswold in the House, thought a dissolution of the Union inevitable\r\nto save Federalism, and for months the project had been discussed in\r\na stifled, mysterious manner. \"It (separation) must begin in\r\nMassachusetts,\" wrote Pickering to George Cabot, \"but New York must be\r\nthe centre of the confederacy.\"[135] To Rufus King, Pickering became\r\nmore specific. \"The Federalists have in general anxiously desired the\r\nelection of Burr--and if a separation should be deemed proper, the\r\nfive New England States, New York and New Jersey, would naturally be\r\nunited.\"[136] But King disapproved disunion. \"Colonel Pickering has\r\nbeen talking to me about a project they have for a separation of the\r\nStates and a northern confederacy,\" he said to Adams of Massachusetts;\r\n\"and he has also been this day talking with General Hamilton. I\r\ndisapprove entirely of the project, and so, I am happy to tell you,\r\ndoes General Hamilton.\"[137] But the conspirators were not to be\r\nquieted by disapproving words. Griswold, in a letter to Oliver\r\nWolcott, declared Burr's election and consequent leadership of the\r\nFederalist party \"the only hope which at this time presents itself of\r\nrallying in defence of the Northern States,\"[138] and in order not to\r\nremain longer inactive, he entered into a bargain with Burr, of which\r\nhe wrote Wolcott fully. Wolcott sent the letter to Hamilton.[139]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: January 29, 1804; Lodge's _Cabot_, p. 337.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: _Ibid._, p. 447.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: _New England Federalism_, p. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: _Hamilton's History_, Vol. 7, p. 781; _New England\r\nFederalism_, p. 354.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Henry Adams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n180. \"Pickering and Griswold could win their game only by bartering\r\ntheir souls; they must invoke the Mephistopheles of politics, Aaron\r\nBurr. To this they had made up their minds from the beginning. Burr's\r\nfour years of office were drawing to a close. He had not a chance of\r\nregaining a commanding place among Republicans, for he was bankrupt in\r\nprivate and public character.\"--_Ibid._, p. 171.]\r\n\r\nIt was plain to Hamilton that these timid conspirators wanted a bold\r\nchief to lead them into secession, and that since he would have\r\nnothing to do with them, they had invoked the aid of Aaron Burr. Thus,\r\nto his former desire to defeat Burr, was now added a determination to\r\ndefeat incipient disunion, and in the Lewis Tavern conference he\r\nargued that Burr, a Democrat either from principle or calculation,\r\nwould remain a Democrat; and that, though detested by leading\r\nClintonians, it would not be difficult for a man of his talents,\r\nintrigue and address, possessing the chair of government, to rally\r\nunder his standard the great body of the party, and such Federalists\r\nas, from personal goodwill or interested motives, may give him\r\nsupport. The effect of his elevation, with the help of Federalists\r\nwould, therefore, be to reunite, under a more adroit, able and daring\r\nchief, not only the now scattered fragments of his own party, but to\r\npresent to the confidence of the people of Federalist New England the\r\ngrandson of President Edwards, for whom they had already a strong\r\npredilection. Thus he would have fair play to disorganise the party of\r\nJefferson, now held in light esteem, and to place himself at the head\r\nof a northern party favouring disunion.\r\n\r\n\"If he be truly, as the Federalists have believed, a man of irregular\r\nand insatiable ambition,\" continued Hamilton, \"he will endeavour to\r\nrise to power on the ladder of Jacobin principles, not leaning on a\r\nfallen party, unfavourable to usurpation and the ascendancy of a\r\ndespotic chief, but rather on popular prejudices and vices, ever ready\r\nto desert a government by the people at a moment when he ought, more\r\nthan ever, to adhere to it. On the other hand, Lansing's personal\r\ncharacter affords some security against pernicious extremes, and, at\r\nthe same time, renders it certain that his party, already much divided\r\nand weakened, will disintegrate more and more, until in a recasting of\r\nparties the Federalists may gain a great accession of force. At any\r\nrate it is wiser to foster schism among Democrats, than to give them a\r\nchief, better able than any they have yet had, to unite and direct\r\nthem.\"[140]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 7, p. 325. \"The\r\nstruggle for control between Hamilton and the conspirators lasted to\r\nthe eve of the election,--secret, stifled, mysterious; the intrigue of\r\nmen afraid to avow their aims, and seeming rather driven by their own\r\npassions than guided by lofty and unselfish motives.\"--Henry Adams,\r\n_History of the United States_, Vol. 2, p. 184.]\r\n\r\nWithin a week after the Lewis Tavern conference Burr's chances\r\nbrightened by the sudden withdrawal of Lansing, because the latter\r\nwould not allow the Clintons to dictate his appointments. This was a\r\ngreat surprise to Republicans and a great grief to Hamilton--the more\r\nso since it was not easy to find an available successor. The mention\r\nof DeWitt Clinton raised the cry of youth; Ambrose Spencer had too\r\nrecently come over from the Federalists; Morgan Lewis lacked capacity\r\nand fitness. Thus the contention continued, but with a leaning more\r\nand more toward Morgan Lewis, a brother-in-law of Chancellor and\r\nEdward Livingston.\r\n\r\nLewis' youth had promised a brilliant future. He graduated with high\r\nhonours at Princeton, and when the guns of Bunker Hill waked the\r\ncountry he promptly exchanged John Jay's law office for John Jay's\r\nregiment. In the latter's absence he retained command as major until\r\nordered to the northern frontier, when he suddenly dropped into a\r\nplace as assistant quartermaster-general, useful and important enough,\r\nbut stripped of the glory usually preferred by the hot blood of a\r\ngallant youth. In time, the faithful, efficient quartermaster became a\r\nplodding, painstaking lawyer, a safe, industrious attorney-general,\r\nand a dignified, respectable judge; but he had not distinguished\r\nhimself, nor did he possess the striking, showy characteristics of\r\nmind or manner often needed in a doubtful and bitterly contested\r\ncampaign. Heretofore place had sought him by appointment. He became\r\nattorney-general when Aaron Burr gave it up for the United States\r\nSenate; and a year later, by the casting vote of Governor Clinton, the\r\nCouncil made him a Supreme Court judge. In 1801 the chief-justiceship\r\ndropped into his lap when Livingston went to France and Lansing became\r\nchancellor, just as the chancellorship would probably have come to him\r\nhad Lansing continued a candidate for governor. In 1803 he wanted to\r\nbe mayor of New York.\r\n\r\nBut with all his ordinariness no one else in sight seemed so available\r\na candidate for governor. The Livingstons, already jealous of DeWitt\r\nClinton's growing influence, secretly nourished the hope that Lewis\r\nmight develop sufficient independence to check the young man's\r\nambition. On the other hand, DeWitt Clinton, equally jealous of the\r\npower wielded by the Livingstons, thought the Chief Justice, a kind,\r\namiable man of sixty, without any particular force of character,\r\nsufficiently plastic to mould to his liking. \"From the moment Clinton\r\ndeclined,\" wrote Hamilton to Rufus King, \"I began to consider Burr as\r\nhaving a chance of success. It was still my reliance, however, that\r\nLansing would outrun him; but now that Chief Justice Lewis is his\r\ncompetitor, the probability, in my judgment, inclines to Burr.\"[141]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 608.]\r\n\r\nBurr's friends, knowing his phenomenal shrewdness in cloaking bargains\r\nand intrigues until the game was bagged, now relied upon him with\r\nconfidence to bring victory out of the known discord and jealousy of\r\nhis opponents, and for a time it looked as if he might succeed.\r\nLansing's withdrawal and Hamilton's failure to put up Rufus King as he\r\ncontemplated, gave Burr the support of Lansing's sympathy and a clear\r\nfield among Federalists, except as modified by Hamilton's influence.\r\nIn addition, his friends cited his ability and Revolutionary services,\r\nhis liberal patronage of science and the arts, his distinguished and\r\nsaintly ancestry, his freedom from family connections to quarter upon\r\nthe public treasury, and his honest endeavour to free himself from\r\ndebt by disposing of his estate. Especially in New York City did he\r\nmeet with encouragement. His headquarters in John Street overflowed\r\nwith ward workers and ward heelers, eager to elect the man upon whom\r\nthey could rely for favours and with whom they doubtless sincerely\r\nsympathised. It was the contest of April, 1800, over again, save that\r\nHamilton did not speak or openly oppose.\r\n\r\nAs the fight continued it increased in bitterness. Cheetham pounded\r\nBurr harder than ever, accusing him of seduction and of dancing with a\r\nbuxom wench at a \"nigger ball\" given by one of his coloured servants\r\nat Richmond Hill. Jefferson was quoted as saying that Burr's party was\r\nnot the real democracy, a statement that the _American Citizen_\r\nprinted in capitals and kept standing during the three days of the\r\nelection. With great earnestness Hamilton quietly warned the\r\nFederalists not to elevate a man who would use their party only to\r\nstrengthen their opponents. In the up-counties, where the influence of\r\nthe Clinton-Livingston-Spencer combine held the party together with\r\ncords of steel, every appointee, from judge of the Supreme Court to\r\njustice of the peace, was ranged on the side of Livingston's\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\nBut Burr, too, had powerful abettors. In Orange and Dutchess he had\r\nalways been a favourite; in Delaware, Erastus Root gave all his\r\ninfluence and all his gifts with the devotion that animated John\r\nSwartout and Marinus Willett in New York; in Ontario, Oliver Phelps,\r\nthe great land speculator, endowed with an unconquerable energy and\r\nthe strategy of a tactician, was backed by Peter B. Porter, the young\r\nand exceedingly popular clerk of that county, soon to be dismissed for\r\nhis independence; in Albany, John Van Ness Yates, remembering Burr's\r\nsupport of his father's candidacy in 1789, also came to his\r\nassistance. Zealous and active, however, as these and other friends\r\nwere, they were few and weak compared to the army of office-holders\r\nshouting and working for Morgan Lewis. When the returns, therefore,\r\nwere in, although Burr carried New York by one hundred, he lost the\r\nState by over eight thousand.[142] A comparison of the vote with the\r\nsenatorial returns of 1803 showed that for every Republican voting for\r\nBurr, a Federalist, influenced by Hamilton, voted for Lewis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Morgan Lewis, 30,829; Aaron Burr, 22,139.--_Civil List,\r\nState of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nIt was Burr's Waterloo. He had staked everything and lost. Bankrupt in\r\npurse, disowned by his party, and distrusted by a large faction of the\r\nleading Federalists, he was without hope of recovery so long as\r\nHamilton blocked the way. There is no evidence that Burr ever saw\r\nHamilton's confidential letters to Morris and other trusted Federal\r\nleaders, or knew their contents, but he did know that Hamilton\r\nbitterly opposed him, and that his influence was blighting. To get rid\r\nof him, therefore, Burr now seems to have deliberately determined to\r\nkill him.[143]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: \"That all Hamilton's doings were known to Burr could\r\nhardly be doubted. He was not a vindictive man, but this was the\r\nsecond time Hamilton had stood in his way and vilified his character.\r\nBurr could have no reason to suppose that Hamilton was deeply loved;\r\nfor he knew that four-fifths of the Federal party had adopted his own\r\nleadership when pitted against Hamilton's in the late election, and he\r\nknew, too, that Pickering, Griswold, and other leading Federalists had\r\nseparated from Hamilton in the hope of making Burr himself the chief\r\nof a Northern confederacy. Burr never cared for the past,--the present\r\nand future were his only thoughts; but his future in politics depended\r\non his breaking somewhere through the line of his personal enemies;\r\nand Hamilton stood first in his path, for Hamilton would certainly\r\nrenew at every critical moment the tactics which had twice cost Burr\r\nhis prize.\"--Henry Adams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 2, pp.\r\n185, 186.]\r\n\r\nWhile in Albany in February to argue the Croswell case, Hamilton had\r\ndined with John Taylor, in company with Dr. Charles D. Cooper, who\r\nwrote a friend that, in the course of the dinner, Hamilton had\r\ndeclared, in substance, that he looked upon Burr as a dangerous\r\nman--one who ought not to be trusted with the reins of government. \"I\r\ncould detail to you,\" continued Cooper, \"a still more despicable\r\nopinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr.\" This letter\r\nfound its way into the newspapers, and in a note, dated June 18, 1804,\r\nBurr called Hamilton's attention to the words \"more despicable,\" and\r\nadded: \"You must perceive, sir, the necessity of a prompt and\r\nunqualified acknowledgment or denial of the use of the expression\r\nwhich could warrant the assertions of Dr. Cooper.\"[144] This note,\r\npurposely offensive in its tone, was delivered by William P. Van Ness,\r\na circumstance clearly indicating an intention to follow it with a\r\nchallenge. Two days later, Hamilton replied, declining to make the\r\nacknowledgment or denial, since he could attach no meaning to the\r\nwords used in the letter, nor could he consent to be interrogated as\r\nto the inferences drawn by third parties, but he was ready to avow or\r\ndisavow any definite opinion with which he might be charged. \"I trust\r\non further reflection,\" concluded Hamilton, \"you will see the matter\r\nin the same light with me. If not, I can only regret the circumstances\r\nand must abide the consequences.\"[145]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 617.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 618.]\r\n\r\nBurr's answer, which plainly shows the rhetoric of \"Aristides,\" was\r\nmore offensive than his initial letter. After replying to it, Hamilton\r\nprepared a note to be informally communicated to Burr, in which he\r\nstated that if the latter chose to inquire into the purport of any\r\nconversation between himself and Dr. Cooper, he would be able to reply\r\nwith truth that it turned wholly on political topics, and had no\r\nrelation to Burr's private character, adding that he was ready to make\r\nan equally frank answer with regard to any other conversation which\r\nBurr would specify.[146] When Burr pronounced this honourable\r\nproposition \"a mere evasion,\" his purpose was as evident as it became\r\non June 27th, the day he sent the challenge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: _Ibid._, p. 621.]\r\n\r\nHamilton's acceptance of the challenge was inevitable. For a hundred\r\nyears men have regretted and mourned that he did not dare to stand\r\nalone against duelling, as he had dared to stand alone for economic\r\nand patriotic principles against the clamour of mobs and the malice of\r\nenemies. But absurd and barbarous as was the custom, it flourished in\r\nChristian America, as it did in every other Christian country, in\r\nspite of Christian ethics; and it would not permit a proud, sensitive\r\nnature, jealous of his honour, especially of his military honour, to\r\nignore it. Lorenzo Sabine's list of duellists includes a score of\r\nprominent Englishmen, Frenchmen and Americans, many of them\r\ncontemporary with Hamilton, and some of them as profoundly admired,\r\nwho succumbed to its tyranny. Proof of his valour at Monmouth and at\r\nYorktown would no more placate the popular contempt and obloquy sure\r\nto follow an avoidance of its demands than would the victory at\r\nWaterloo have excused Wellington had he declined to challenge Lord\r\nWinchilsea. All this did not make duelling right, but it excuses a\r\nnoble soul for yielding \"to the force of an imperious custom,\" as Dr.\r\nKnott put it--a custom that still exists in France and Germany, and in\r\nsome parts of America, perhaps, though now universally execrated by\r\nChristian people and pronounced murder by their laws. Even at that\r\ntime Hamilton held it in abhorrence. In a paper drawn for publication\r\nin the event of death, he announced his intention of throwing away his\r\nfire, and in extenuation of yielding, he adds: \"To those who, with me,\r\nabhorring the practice of duelling, may think that I ought on no\r\naccount to have added to the number of bad examples, I answer that my\r\nrelative situation, as well in public as in private, enforcing all the\r\nconsiderations which constitute what men of the world denominate\r\nhonour, imposed on me, as I thought, a peculiar necessity not to\r\ndecline the call. The ability to be in the future useful, whether in\r\nresisting mischief, or effecting good, in those crises of our public\r\naffairs which seem likely to happen, would probably be inseparable\r\nfrom a conformity with public prejudice in this particular.\"[147] The\r\npathway of history is strewn with the wrecks of customs and\r\nsuperstitions which have held men in their grip, compelling obedience\r\nand demanding regularity; but no custom ever had a firmer hold upon\r\ngifted men than duelling, making them its devotees even when their\r\nintellects condemned it, their hearts recognised its cruelty, and\r\ntheir consciences pronounced it wrong.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, pp. 626-8.]\r\n\r\nBecause of Hamilton's engagements in court, the hostile meeting was\r\ndeferred until Wednesday, July 11th. In the meantime the principals\r\nwent about their vocations with apparent indifference to the coming\r\nevent. On the evening of July 4th, Hamilton and Burr attended the\r\nannual dinner of the Society of the Cincinnati, of which the former\r\nhad succeeded Washington as president. The occasion was remembered as\r\nthe gayest and most hilarious in the society's history. Hamilton\r\nleaped upon the table and sang \"The Drum,\" an old camp song that\r\nbecame historic because of his frequent rendition of it. It was\r\nrecalled afterward that Burr withdrew before the festivities had\r\nended. On Saturday evening Hamilton dined Colonel Trumbull, one of\r\nWashington's first aides, and on Monday attended a reception given by\r\nOliver Wolcott, John Adams' secretary of the treasury. Tuesday evening\r\nhe prepared the paper already quoted, and addressed a letter to\r\nTheodore Sedgwick, one of Pickering's sternest conspirators, warning\r\nhim against disunion. \"Dismemberment of our empire,\" he said, \"will be\r\na clear sacrifice of great positive advantages, without any\r\ncounterbalancing good; administering no relief to our real disease,\r\nwhich is democracy--the poison of which, by a subdivision, will only\r\nbe the more concentred in each part, and consequently the more\r\nvirulent.\"[148]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 615. Letter to\r\nTheo. Sedgwick.]\r\n\r\nMeantime the secret had been confined to less than a dozen persons,\r\nand to none of Hamilton's intimate friends. Troup remained with him\r\nuntil a late hour Monday night without suspecting anything, the gaiety\r\nof his manner leading his friend to think his health was mending. Had\r\nTroup divined the hostile meeting, it might not have occurred. When\r\nJohn Swartout entered Burr's room at daylight on that fatal 11th of\r\nJuly, he found him sound asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was seven o'clock Wednesday morning, a hot July day, that Hamilton\r\ncrossed the Hudson to Weehawken, with Pendleton, his second, and Dr.\r\nHosack, Burr and Van Ness having preceded them. It took but a moment\r\nto measure ten paces, load the pistols, and place the principals in\r\nposition. As the word was given, Burr took deliberate aim and fired.\r\nInstantly Hamilton reeled and fell forward headlong upon his face,\r\ninvoluntarily discharging his pistol. \"This is a mortal wound,\r\nDoctor,\" he gasped, and immediately sank into a swoon. An examination\r\nshowed that the ball had penetrated the right side. Burr, sheltered by\r\nVan Ness under an umbrella, hurried from the scene, while Hamilton,\r\nconveyed in his boat to the city, gradually recovered consciousness.\r\n\"My vision is indistinct,\" he murmured; but soon after, catching\r\nsight of a pistol near him, cautioned them to take care of it. \"It is\r\nundischarged and still cocked,\" he said; \"it may go off and do harm.\r\nPendleton knows I did not intend to fire at him.\" As the boat neared\r\nthe wharf, he asked that Mrs. Hamilton be sent for. \"Let the event be\r\ngradually broken to her,\" he said, \"but give her hopes.\" Thus he\r\nlingered for thirty-one hours in great agony, but retaining his\r\nself-command to the last, and dying in the midst of his stricken\r\nfamily and sorrowing friends.\r\n\r\nIf Washington and Lincoln be excepted, it is doubtful if an American\r\nwas ever more deeply mourned. Had he been President, he could not have\r\nbeen buried with greater pomp, or with manifestations of more profound\r\nsorrow. Although he had been hated by his enemies, and at times\r\nmisunderstood by some of his friends, at his death the people, without\r\ndivision, instantly recognised that his life had been passionately\r\ndevoted to his country, and they paid him the tribute only accorded\r\nthe memory of a most illustrious patriot. Such demonstrations were not\r\nconfined to New York. The sorrow became national; speeches, sermons,\r\nand poems without number, were composed in his honour; in every State,\r\nsome county or town received his name; wherever an American lived, an\r\nexpression of sympathy found record. It was the consensus of opinion\r\nthat the life which began in January, 1757 and ended in July, 1804,\r\nheld in the compass of its forty-seven years the epitome of what\r\nAmerica meant for Americans in the days of its greatest peril and its\r\ngreatest glory. \"Had he lived twenty years longer,\" said Chancellor\r\nKent, \"I have very little doubt he would have rivalled Socrates or\r\nBacon, or any other of the sages of ancient or modern times, in\r\nresearches after truth and in benevolence to mankind. The active and\r\nprofound statesman, the learned and eloquent lawyer, would probably\r\nhave disappeared in a great degree before the character of the sage\r\nand philosopher, instructing mankind by his wisdom, and elevating the\r\ncountry by his example.\"[149]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: William Kent, _Life of James Kent_, appendix, p. 328.]\r\n\r\nBurr became a name of horror.[150] When Hamilton's death was announced\r\nthere came a cry of execration on his murderer, which the publication\r\nof the correspondence intensified. A coroner's jury pronounced him a\r\nmurderer, the grand jury instructed the district attorney to\r\nprosecute, and the Vice President found it necessary to take refuge in\r\nconcealment until the first fury of the people had subsided.\r\nCheetham's pen, following him remorselessly, charged that he ransacked\r\nthe newspapers for the grounds of a challenge; that for three months\r\nhe daily practised with a pistol; and that while Hamilton lay dying,\r\nhe sat at the table drinking wine with his friends, and apologising\r\nthat he had not shot him through the heart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: \"Orators, ministers, and newspapers exhausted\r\nthemselves in execration of Burr.\"--Henry Adams, _History of the\r\nUnited States_, Vol. 2, p. 190.]\r\n\r\nWithin two years Burr was arrested for treason, charged with an\r\nattempt to place himself at the head of a new nation formed from the\r\ncountry of the Montezumas and the valley of the Mississippi, and,\r\nalthough he was acquitted, his countrymen believed him guilty of a\r\ntreasonable ambition. In the State where he had found his chief\r\nsupport, he ever after ranked in infamy next to Benedict Arnold.\r\nThenceforth he became a stranger and a wanderer on the face of the\r\nearth. His friends left him and society shunned him. \"I have not\r\nspoken to the damned reptile for twenty-five years,\" said former\r\nGovernor Morgan Lewis, in 1830.[151]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 370.]\r\n\r\nFor the moment, one forgets the horrible tragedy of July 11, 1804, and\r\nthinks only of the lonely man who lived to lament it. He was in his\r\neighty-first year when he died. On his return from Europe in 1812,\r\nonly one person welcomed him. This was Matthew L. Davis, his earliest\r\npolitical friend and biographer. Burr made Davis his literary\r\nexecutor, and turned over to him the confidential female\r\ncorrespondence that had accumulated in the days of his popularity as\r\nUnited States senator and Vice President, and that he had carefully\r\nfiled and indorsed with the full name of each writer. The treachery,\r\nfalsehood, and desertion with which these letters charged him, seemed\r\nto this unnatural man to add to their value, and he gave them to his\r\nexecutor without instructions, that the extent of his gallantries, his\r\npower of fascination, and the names of the gifted and beautiful\r\nvictims of his numerous amours might not become a secret in his grave.\r\nOne can conceive nothing baser. The preservation of letters to satisfy\r\nan erotic mind is low enough, but deliberately to identify each\r\nanonymous or initialled letter with the full name of the writer, for\r\nthe use of a biographer, is an act of treachery of which few men are\r\ncapable. To the credit of Davis, these letters were either returned to\r\ntheir writers or consigned to the flames.\r\n\r\nBurr was a politician by nature, habit and education. In his younger\r\ndays he easily enlisted the goodwill and sympathy of his associates,\r\nsurrounding himself with a large circle of devoted, obedient friends;\r\nand, though neither a great lawyer nor a brilliant speaker, his\r\nnatural gifts, supplemented by industry and perseverance, and a very\r\nattractive presence, made him a conspicuous member of the New York bar\r\nand of the United States Senate. He was, however, the ardent champion\r\nof nothing that made for the public good. Indeed, the record of his\r\nwhole life indicates that he never possessed a great thought, or\r\nfathered an important measure. Throughout the long, and, at times,\r\nbitter controversy over the establishment of the Union, his silence\r\nwas broken only to predict its failure within half a century.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if he was ever a happy man. In the very hours when he\r\nwas the most famous and the most flattered, he described himself as\r\nmost unhappy. So long, though, as Theodosia lived, he was never alone.\r\nWhen she died, he suffered till the end. There has hardly ever been in\r\nthe world a more famous pair of lovers than Burr and his gifted, noble\r\ndaughter, and there is nothing in history more profoundly melancholy\r\nthan the loss of the ship, driven by the pitiless wind of fate, on\r\nwhich Theodosia had taken passage for her southern home. Yet one is\r\nshocked at the unnatural parent who instructs his daughter to read, in\r\nthe event of his death in the duel with Hamilton, the confidential\r\nletters which came to him in the course of his love intrigues and\r\naffairs of gallantry. It imports a moral obliquity that, happily for\r\nsociety, is found in few human beings. As he lived, so he died, a\r\nstrange, lonely, unhappy man, out of tune with the beautiful world in\r\nwhich he was permitted to exist upward of four score years. He had\r\ndone a great deal of harm, and, except as a Revolutionary soldier, no\r\ngood whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE CLINTONS AGAINST THE LIVINGSTONS\r\n\r\n1804-1807\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Morgan Lewis began his term as governor tranquillity\r\ncharacterised public affairs in the State and in the nation. The\r\nLouisiana Purchase had strengthened the Administration with all\r\nclasses of people; Jefferson and George Clinton had received 162\r\nelectoral votes to 14 for Pinckney and Rufus King; Burr had gone into\r\nretirement and was soon to go into obscurity; the Livingstons, filling\r\nhigh places, were distinguishing themselves at home and abroad as able\r\njudges and successful diplomatists; DeWitt Clinton, happy and\r\neminently efficient as the mayor of New York, seemed to have before\r\nhim a bright and prosperous career as a skilful and triumphant party\r\nmanager; while George Clinton, softened by age, rich in favouring\r\nfriends, with an ideal face for a strong, bold portrait, was basking\r\nin the soft, mellow glow that precedes the closing of a stormy life.\r\nNever before, perhaps never since, did a governor enter upon his\r\nduties, neither unusual nor important, under more favourable auspices;\r\nyet the story of Lewis' administration is a story of astonishing\r\nmistakes and fatal factional strife.\r\n\r\nThe Governor inaugurated his new career by an unhappy act of\r\npatronage. The appointment of Maturin Livingston, his son-in-law, and\r\nthe removal of Peter B. Porter, the friend of Burr, showed a selfish,\r\nalmost malevolent disregard of public opinion and the public service,\r\na trait that, in a way, characterised his policy throughout.\r\nLivingston was notoriously unfitted for recorder of New York. He was\r\nunpopular in his manners, deficient in a knowledge of law, without\r\nindustry, and given to pleasure rather than business, but, because of\r\nhis relationship, the Governor forced him into that responsible\r\nposition. In like manner, although until then no change had occurred\r\nwithin the party for opinion's sake, Lewis voted for the removal of\r\nPeter B. Porter, the young and popular clerk of Ontario County.\r\nPorter's youth indicated an intelligence that promised large returns\r\nto his country and his party, and the Governor lived long enough to\r\nsee him honourably distinguished in Congress, highly renowned when his\r\nserious career began on the Niagara frontier in the War of 1812, and,\r\nafterward, richly rewarded as secretary of war in the Cabinet of John\r\nQuincy Adams. But in 1805 the Governor cheerfully voted for his\r\nremoval, thus establishing the dangerous precedent that a member of\r\none's political household was to be treated with as little\r\nconsideration as a member of the opposite party.\r\n\r\nAlthough Lewis' conduct in the case of Maturin Livingston and Peter B.\r\nPorter was not the most foolish act in a career of folly, it served as\r\na fitting preface to his policy in relation to the incorporation of\r\nthe Merchants' Bank of New York, a policy that proved fatal to his\r\nambition and to the influence of the Livingstons. Already doing\r\nbusiness under the general laws, two Republican Legislatures had\r\nrefused to incorporate the Merchants' Bank. But during the legislative\r\nsession of 1805 the bank people determined to have their way, and in\r\nthe efforts that followed they used methods and means common enough\r\nafterward, but probably unknown before that winter. Although in no\r\nwise connected with the scandal growing out of the controversy, Lewis\r\nfavoured the incorporation of the bank. On the other hand, DeWitt\r\nClinton opposed it, maintaining that two banks in New York City were\r\nsufficient. However, the Governor, backed by the Federalists and a\r\nsmall Republican majority, was successful. In the Council of Revision,\r\nAmbrose Spencer opposed the act of incorporation on the ground that\r\nexisting banks, possessing five million dollars of capital, with\r\nauthority to issue notes and create debts to the amount of fifteen\r\nmillion more, were sufficient, especially as the United States had\r\nsuffered an alarming decrease of specie, and as no one save a few\r\nindividuals, inspired solely by cupidity, had asked for a new bank.\r\nSpencer, however, relied principally in his attack upon affidavits of\r\nObadiah German, the Republican leader of the Assembly, and Stephen\r\nThorn of the same body, charging that Senator Ebenezer Purdy, the\r\nfather of the measure, had offered them large rewards for their votes,\r\nGerman having Purdy's admission that he had become convinced of the\r\npropriety of incorporating the bank after a confidential conference\r\nwith its directors. From this it was to be inferred, argued Spencer,\r\nthat before such improper means were made use of, Purdy himself, whose\r\nvote was necessary to its passage, was averse to its incorporation.\r\n\"To sanction a bill thus marked in its progress through one branch of\r\nthe Legislature with bribery and corruption,\" concluded the Judge,\r\n\"would be subversive of all pure legislation, and become a reproach to\r\na government hitherto renowned for the wisdom of its councils and the\r\nintegrity of its legislatures.\"[152] But Spencer's opposition and\r\nPurdy's resignation, to avoid an investigation, did not defeat the\r\nmeasure, which had the support of Chief Justice Kent, a Federalist,\r\nand two members of the Livingston family, a majority of the Council.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: Alfred B. Street, _New York Council of Revision_, p.\r\n429.]\r\n\r\nDeWitt Clinton had not approved the Governor's course. The flagrant\r\npartiality shown Lewis' family in the unpopular appointment of Maturin\r\nLivingston, his son-in-law, displeased him, and the removal of Porter\r\nseemed to him untimely and vindictive. In killing Hamilton, Clinton\r\nreasoned, Burr had killed himself politically, and out of the way\r\nhimself there was no occasion to punish his friends who would now\r\nrejoin and strengthen the Republican party. Clinton, however, remained\r\npassive in his opposition until the incorporation of the bank\r\nfurnished a plausible excuse for an appeal to the party; then, with a\r\ndetermination to subjugate the Livingstons, he caused himself and his\r\nadherents to be nominated and elected to the State Senate upon the\r\nplatform that \"a new bank has been created in our city, and its\r\ncharter granted to political enemies.\" It was a bold move, as stubborn\r\nas it was dangerous. Clinton had little to gain. The Livingstons were\r\nnot long to continue in New York politics. Maturin was insignificant;\r\nBrockholst was soon to pass to the Supreme Court of the United States;\r\nEdward had already sought a new home and greater honours in New\r\nOrleans; and the Chancellor, having returned from France, was without\r\nambition to remain longer in the political arena. Even the\r\nbrothers-in-law were soon to disappear. John Armstrong was in France;\r\nSmith Thompson, who was to follow Brockholst upon the bench of the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court, refused to engage in party or political\r\ncontests, and the gifts of Tillotson and Lewis were not of quality or\r\nquantity to make leaders of men. On the other hand, Clinton had much\r\nto lose by forcing the fight. It condemned him to a career of almost\r\nunbroken opposition for the rest of his life; it made precedents that\r\nlived to curse him; and it compelled alliances that weakened him.\r\n\r\nLewis resented Clinton's imperious methods, but he made a fatal\r\nmistake in furnishing him such a pretext for open opposition. He ought\r\nto have known that in opposing the Merchants' Bank, Clinton\r\nrepresented the great majority of his party which did not believe in\r\nbanks. Undoubtedly Clinton's interest in the Manhattan largely\r\ncontrolled his attitude toward the Merchants', but the controversy\r\nover the latter was so old, and its claims had been pressed so\r\nearnestly by the Federalists in their own interest, that the question\r\nhad practically become a party issue as much as the contest over the\r\nBank of the United States. Already two Republican Legislatures had\r\ndefeated it, and in a third it was now being urged to success with the\r\nhelp of a solid Federalist vote and a system of flagrant bribery, of\r\nwhich the Governor was fully advised. A regard for party opinion, if\r\nno higher motive, therefore, might well have governed Lewis' action.\r\nAfter the fight had been precipitated, resulting in a warfare fatal to\r\nLewis, the Governor's apologists claimed that in favouring the bank\r\nhe had simply resisted Clinton's domination. The Governor may have\r\nthought so, but it was further evidence of his inability either to\r\nunderstand the sentiment dominating the party he sought to represent,\r\nor successfully to compete with Clinton in leadership. DeWitt Clinton,\r\nwith all his faults, and they were many and grave, had in him the\r\ngifts of a master and the capacity of a statesman. Lewis seems to have\r\nhad neither gifts nor capacity.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1806, DeWitt Clinton, securing a majority of the Council\r\nof Appointment by the election of himself and two friends, sounded the\r\nsignal of attack upon the Governor and his supporters. He substituted\r\nPierre C. Van Wyck for Maturin Livingston and Elisha Jenkins for\r\nThomas Tillotson. The Governor's friends were also evicted from minor\r\noffice, only men hostile to Lewis' re-election being preferred.\r\nNothing could be less justifiable, or, indeed, more nefarious than\r\nsuch removals. They were discreditable to the Council and disgraceful\r\nto DeWitt Clinton; yet sentiment of the time seems to have approved\r\nthem, regarding Clinton's conduct merely as a stroke of good politics.\r\nIn the midst of this wretched business it is pleasant to note that\r\nJenkins' transfer from comptroller to secretary of state opened a way\r\nfor the appointment of Archibald McIntyre, whose safe custody of the\r\npurse in days when economies and husbandries were in order,\r\ndistinguished him as a faithful official, and kept him in office until\r\n1821.\r\n\r\nAfter such drastic treatment of the Governor, it is not without\r\ninterest to think of Lewis in Albany and Clinton in New York keeping\r\ntheir eyes upon the election in April, 1806, both alike hopeful of\r\nfinding allies in the party breakup. The advantage seemed to be wholly\r\nwith the Mayor and not with the Governor. Indeed, Republicans of all\r\nfactions were so well assured of Clinton's success that it required\r\nthe faith of a novice in politics to believe that Lewis had any\r\nchance. But DeWitt Clinton had to deal with two classes of men,\r\nnaturally and almost relentlessly opposed to him--the friends of Burr\r\nand the Federalists. It was of immense importance that the former\r\nshould stand with him, since the Federalists were certain to side with\r\nthe Lewisites or \"Quids,\" as the Governor's friends came to be known,\r\nand to secure such an advantage Clinton promptly made overtures to the\r\nBurrites, of whom John Swartout, Peter Irving and Matthew L. Davis\r\nwere the leaders.\r\n\r\nThere is some confusion as to details, but Davis is authority for the\r\nstatement that in December, 1805, Theodorus Bailey, as Clinton's\r\nagent, promised to aid Burr's friends through the Manhattan Bank, to\r\nrecognise them as Republicans, to appoint them to office on the same\r\nfooting with the most favoured Clintonian, and to stop Cheetham's\r\nattacks in the _American Citizen_. Clinton pronounced the story false,\r\nbut it was known that the Manhattan Bank loaned eighteen thousand\r\ndollars to a prominent Burrite; that on January 24, 1806, Clinton met\r\nSwartout, Irving and Davis at the home of Bailey; and that afterward,\r\non February 20, leading Clintonians banqueted the Burrites at Dyde's\r\nHotel in the suburbs of New York in celebration of their union. There\r\nwere many reasons for maintaining the profoundest secrecy as to this\r\nalliance and Dyde's Hotel had been selected for the purpose of\r\navoiding publicity, but the morning's papers revealed the secret with\r\nan exaggerated account of their doings and sayings. Immediately, other\r\nBurrites, joining the Lewisites at Martling's Long-room, a popular\r\nmeeting-place, organised a protestant faction, afterward known as\r\nMartling Men, whose enmity was destined to follow Clinton to his\r\ndownfall.\r\n\r\nAs election day approached the Quids made a decisive struggle against\r\nClinton. They rehearsed the charges of \"Aristides;\" they denounced him\r\nas cold and imperious; they charged that he had an almost boundless\r\npolitical ambition; that he maintained his own councils regardless of\r\nhis associates, and accepted no suggestion not in harmony with his own\r\npolicy. The Martling Men accused him of duplicity, and of a desire\r\nonly for place and pay. In aid of Lewis, Chancellor Lansing took this\r\nopportunity of revealing the secret that led him to withdraw from the\r\ngubernatorial race in 1804, charging that George Clinton had sought\r\n\"to pledge him to a particular course of conduct in the administration\r\nof the government of the State.\" When the latter denied the statement,\r\nLansing, becoming more specific, affirmed that the venerable statesman\r\nhad mentioned DeWitt Clinton as a suitable person for chancellor. It\r\nis not surprising, perhaps, that DeWitt Clinton's reply that if\r\ntendered the office he would have declined it, fell upon incredulous\r\nears, since the young man at that very moment was holding three\r\noffices and drawing three salaries.\r\n\r\nBut the contest did not become seriously doubtful until the Quids\r\nreceived the active support of the Federalists, just then led by\r\nWilliam W. Van Ness, who seems to have leaped into prominence as\r\nsuddenly as did \"Aristides,\" his cousin. If we may estimate the man by\r\nthe praises of his contemporaries, William W. Van Ness' eloquence\r\ndelighted the Assembly of which he had become a member in 1805, not\r\nmore than his pointed and finished wit charmed every social gathering\r\nwhich he honoured with his presence. Indeed, as a popular orator he\r\nseems to have had no rival. Though his passion for distinction was too\r\nardent and his fondness for sensual pleasure immoderate, sober minded\r\nmen were carried away with the fascinating effervescence of his public\r\nutterances and the brilliancy of his conversation. He had a commanding\r\npresence, almost a colossal form, and a voice marvellous for its\r\nstrength and for the music of its intonations. He was neither profound\r\nnor learned. The common school at Claverack, where he was born in\r\nindependence year, furnished him little more than the rudiments of\r\nEnglish, and at the age of twenty he closed the door to further\r\nadvancement by prematurely burdening himself with a family; yet he\r\nseemed to know without apparent effort everything that was necessary\r\nto know, and to exert a gentle, unconscious, unpretending power that\r\nwas resistless. A sweetness of temper and a native dignity of manner\r\ncast a grace and charm about him which acted as a spell upon all who\r\ncame within its influence. Hammond, the historian, thought him the\r\npossessor of every gift that nature and fortune could bestow--wit,\r\nbeauty, good nature, suave manners, eloquence, and admirable\r\nconversation. Such a combination gave him leadership, and he led his\r\nfollowers solidly to Lewis, with the result that the coalition of\r\nFederalists and Quids won out by a small majority.\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature assembled, in January, 1807, the intense\r\nbitterness of the fight exhibited itself in the defeat of Solomon\r\nSouthwick for clerk of the Assembly. Southwick possessed the amiable,\r\nwinning qualities that characterised William W. Van Ness. He was\r\nassociated with his brother-in-law in the management of the Albany\r\n_Register_, and from his earliest youth had been as zealous a\r\nRepublican as he was warm and disinterested in his friendships. To\r\nfriend and foe he was alike cordial and generous. He possessed an open\r\nmind, not so eloquent as Van Ness, and less brilliant, perhaps, in\r\nconversation; but the fluent splendour of his speech and the beauty of\r\nhis person and manners went as far toward the attainment of his\r\nambition. He had been elected clerk of the Assembly continuously since\r\n1803, until his popularity among the members, whom he served with\r\nuniform politeness and zeal, seemed proof against the attacks of any\r\nadversary. Just now, however, the enemies of DeWitt Clinton were the\r\nopponents of Solomon Southwick, while his rival, Garret Y. Lansing,\r\nthe nephew of the Chancellor, had become the bitterest and most\r\nformidable enemy the Clintons had to encounter. Popular as he was,\r\nSouthwick could not win against such odds, although it turned out that\r\na change of four votes would have elected him.\r\n\r\nA Lewis Council of Appointment made a clean sweep of the Governor's\r\nenemies and of DeWitt Clinton's friends. Clinton himself gave up the\r\nmayoralty of New York, Maturin Livingston again assumed the duties of\r\nrecorder, and Thomas Tillotson was restored to the office of secretary\r\nof state. Perhaps Clinton thought he stood too high to be in danger\r\nfrom Lewis' hand. If he did he found out his mistake, for Lewis\r\nstruck him down in the most unsparing and humiliating way. Public\r\naffront was added to political deprivation. Without warning or\r\nexplanation, the first motion put at the first meeting of the new\r\nCouncil, on February 6, 1807, made him the first sacrifice. Had he\r\nbeen a justice of the peace in a remote western county he could not\r\nhave been treated more rudely; and, it may be added, if better reason\r\nthan that already existing were needed to seal the fate of Lewis,\r\nClinton's removal furnished it. New York has seldom been roused to\r\ngreater passion by a governor's act. It could even then be said of\r\nClinton that his name was associated with every great enterprise for\r\nthe public good. Less than a year before, in his efforts to educate\r\nthe children of the poor, unprovided for in parochial schools, he had\r\nlaid the foundation of the public school system, heading the\r\nsubscription list for the purchase of suitable quarters. In spite of\r\nhis faults he was a great executive, and before the sun went down on\r\nthe day of his removal a large majority of the Republican members of\r\nthe Legislature, guided by the deposed mayor, had nominated Daniel D.\r\nTompkins for governor in place of Morgan Lewis.\r\n\r\nIn disposing of the mayoralty, Lewis recognised the importance of\r\nkeeping it in the family, and offered it to Smith Thompson, both of\r\nwhose wives were Livingstons; but only once in forty years did\r\nThompson's love for the judiciary give way to political preferment,\r\nand then Martin Van Buren defeated him for governor. The mayoralty\r\nfinally went to Marinus Willett, an officer of distinguished service\r\nin the Revolutionary war, whose gallantry at Fort Schuyler in the\r\nsummer of 1777 won him a sword from Congress and the admiration of\r\nGeneral Washington. But the steadfast, judicious qualities that\r\ncommended him as a soldier seem to have forsaken him as a politician.\r\nHe supported Burr, he followed Lewis, and he finally ran for\r\nlieutenant-governor against DeWitt Clinton, the regular nominee of his\r\nparty, losing the election by a large majority; yet his amiability and\r\nwar services kept him a favourite in spite of his political wavering.\r\nIt was hard for a lover of his country to dislike a real hero of the\r\nRevolution, even though he forfeited the confidence of his party.\r\n\r\nClinton, who had kept his head cool in victory, did not lose it in\r\ndefeat; but the Governor found himself in an awkward and humiliating\r\nposition. Although the Federalists had made it possible for him to\r\norganise the Legislature and elect a friendly Council, he dared not\r\nappoint one of them to office, and the few ambitious Republicans who\r\nhad marshalled under his standard proved inferior, inexperienced, or\r\nindiscreet. Only one Federalist fared well, and he succeeded in spite\r\nof Lewis. William W. Van Ness aspired to the Supreme Court judgeship\r\nmade vacant by Brockholst Livingston's appointment to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States. The Governor, favouring, of course, a\r\nmember of his own family, proposed Maturin Livingston. To this Thomas\r\nThomas of the Council agreed, but Edward Savage proposed John\r\nWoodworth; John Nicholas inclined to Jonas Platt, and James Burt, the\r\nfourth member of the Council, preferred Van Ness. Platt was a\r\nFederalist, and in his way a remarkable man. His father, Zephaniah\r\nPlatt, served in the Continental Congress, and as judge of the Circuit\r\nCourt had pushed his way to the northern frontier, founded Plattsburg,\r\nand advocated a system of canals connecting the Hudson with the lakes.\r\nThe son, following his example, studied law and emigrated to the\r\nwestern frontier, settling in Herkimer County, at Whitesboro. He had\r\nalready served one term in the Legislature and one in Congress, and\r\nwas destined to receive other honourable preferment. But just now\r\nNicholas, his political backer, a recent comer from Virginia, who had\r\nserved with him in Congress, was no match for the adroit Burt, whose\r\nshrewd management in the interest of Aaron Burr had recently sent\r\nTheodorus Bailey to the United States Senate over John Woodworth. Burt\r\nconvinced Nicholas that Platt's candidacy would result in the election\r\nof Livingston or Woodworth, and having thus destroyed the Herkimer\r\nlawyer, he appealed to Savage to drop Woodworth in favour of Van\r\nNess. Savage was a Republican of the old school, a supporter of George\r\nClinton, an opponent of the Federal Constitution, who had apparently\r\nfollowed Lewis for what he could make out of it; but he was indisposed\r\nto add to the sin of rebellion against DeWitt Clinton the folly of\r\nvoting for Maturin Livingston, and so he joined Burt and Nicholas in\r\nsupport of Van Ness. Thus it happened that the popular young orator\r\nbecame a member of the Supreme Court at the early age of thirty-one,\r\nbeing the youngest member of the court, save Daniel D. Tompkins, to\r\nserve on the old, conservative Council of Revision.\r\n\r\nNews of this bad business intensified the angry feeling against the\r\nGovernor. A place on the Supreme Court, valued then even more highly\r\nthan now, had been lost to the party because of his arrogant and\r\nconsuming nepotism, and men turned with enthusiasm to Daniel D.\r\nTompkins, whose nomination for governor brought him champions that had\r\nheretofore avoided all appearance of violent partisanship. Tompkins\r\nwas accepted as the exponent of all that Republicans most prized;\r\nLewis as their most obstinate and offensive opponent. Thus, at last,\r\nthe Clintons faced the Livingstons on a fair field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nDANIEL D. TOMPKINS AND DeWITT CLINTON\r\n\r\n1807-1810\r\n\r\n\r\nHad DeWitt Clinton succeeded to the governorship in 1807, his way to\r\nthe Presidency, upon which his eye was already fixed, might have\r\nopened easily and surely. But the bitterness of the Livingstons and\r\nthe unfriendly disposition of the Federalists compelled him to flank\r\nthe difficulty by presenting a candidate for governor who was void of\r\noffence. If it was humiliating to admit his own ineligibility, it was\r\nno less so to meet the new condition, for Lewis' election in 1804 had\r\ndiscovered the scarcity of available material, and developed the\r\ndanger of relying upon another to do his bidding. Just now Clinton\r\nwanted a candidate with no convictions, no desires, no ambitions, and\r\nno purposes save to please him. There were men enough of this kind,\r\nbut they could neither conceal their master's hand, nor command the\r\nsuffrages of a majority on their own account. In this crisis,\r\ntherefore, he selected, to the surprise of all and to the disgust of\r\nsome, Daniel D. Tompkins, the young and amiable justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt, who had taken the place of James Kent on the latter's promotion\r\nto chief justice.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that the day which witnessed DeWitt Clinton's removal\r\nfrom the New York mayoralty, welcomed into larger political life this\r\nman of honourable parentage, who was destined to play a very\r\nconspicuous part in affairs of state. Daniel D. Tompkins, a youth of\r\npromise and a young man of ripening wisdom, had been for some years in\r\nthe public eye, first as a member of the constitutional convention of\r\n1801, afterward as a successful candidate for Congress, and later as\r\na judge of the Supreme Court. His rise had been phenomenally rapid. He\r\npassed from the farm to the college at seventeen, from college to the\r\nlaw office at twenty-one, from the law office to the constitutional\r\nconvention at twenty-seven, and thence to Congress and the Supreme\r\nCourt at thirty. He was now to become governor at thirty-three. But\r\nwith all his promise and wisdom and rapid advancement, no one dreamed\r\nin 1807 that he was soon to divide political honour and power with\r\nDeWitt Clinton, five years his senior.\r\n\r\nTompkins was on the farm when Clinton was in Columbia College; but if\r\nthe plow lengthened his days, study shortened his nights, and five\r\nyears after Clinton graduated, Tompkins entered the same institution.\r\nJust then it was a stern chase. Clinton had the advantage of family,\r\nTompkins the disadvantage of being a stranger. When the former entered\r\nthe Legislature, the latter had only opened a law office. Then, but\r\nfour years later, they met in the constitutional convention, Clinton\r\non the winning side and Tompkins on the right side. The purpose of\r\nthis convention, it will be recalled, had been to give each member of\r\nthe Council of Appointment the power to nominate candidates for\r\noffice--Clinton holding that the Council had the right to nominate as\r\nwell as to confirm appointments; Tompkins, with barely a dozen\r\nassociates, took the ground, maintained by Governors Clinton and Jay,\r\nthat its power was limited to confirmation. This position showed the\r\nnerve as well as the independence of the younger man, and he was able\r\nproudly to refer to it when, twenty years later, the constitutional\r\nconvention of 1821, inspired by the popular contempt, achieved the\r\nabolition of the Council, and with it the political corruption and\r\nfavouritism to which it had given rise.\r\n\r\nThe record of New York politics is a record of long and bitter\r\ncontests between these chiefs of two antagonistic Republican factions.\r\nWhat the struggle between Stalwarts and Half Breeds was to our own\r\ntime, the struggle between Clinton and Tompkins was to our ancestors\r\nof two and three generations ago. Two men could hardly be more\r\nsharply contrasted. The one appeared cold and reserved, the other most\r\ngracious and gentle; Clinton's self-confidence destroyed the fidelity\r\nof those who differed in opinion, Tompkins' urbanity disarmed their\r\ndisloyalty; Clinton was unrelenting, dogged in his tenacity, quick to\r\nspeak harshly, moving within lines of purpose regardless of those of\r\nleast resistance. Although he often changed his associates, like Lord\r\nShaftesbury, he never changed his purposes. Tompkins, always firm and\r\ndignified, was affable in manner, sympathetic in speech, overflowing\r\nwith good nature, and unpretending to all who approached him. It used\r\nto be said that Tompkins made more friends in refusing favours than\r\nClinton did in granting them.\r\n\r\nThe two men also differed as much in personal appearance as in manner.\r\nTompkins, shapely and above the ordinary height, had large, full eyes,\r\ntwinkling with kindness, a high forehead wreathed with dark, curly\r\nhair, and an oval face, easily and usually illuminated with a smile;\r\nClinton had a big frame, square shoulders, a broad, full forehead,\r\nshort, pompadour hair, dark penetrating eyes, and a large mouth with\r\nlips firmly set. It was a strong face. A dullard could read his\r\ncharacter at a glance. To his intimate friends Clinton was undoubtedly\r\na social, agreeable companion; but the dignified imperiousness of his\r\nmanner and the severity of his countenance usually overcame the\r\nordinary visitor before the barriers of his reserve were broken.\r\nTompkins, on the contrary, carried the tenderness of a wide humanity\r\nin his face.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly creditable to Clinton's knowledge of human nature that\r\nhe selected Daniel D. Tompkins for a gubernatorial candidate, if he\r\nsought a man whom he might control. The memory of the constitutional\r\nconvention, or a glance into the history of the elder Tompkins, who\r\nhad stood firm and unyielding in the little settlement of Fox Meadows\r\nin Winchester after the American defeat on Long Island, when all his\r\nneighbours save two had faltered in the cause of independence, would\r\nhave enlightened him respecting the Tompkins character. The farmer\r\nboy's determined, patient preparation for public life, and his\r\nfortitude in the face of conscious disadvantages, ought also to have\r\nsuggested that the young man was made of sterner stuff than the\r\nobedient Theodorus Bailey. Still more surprising is it that Clinton\r\nshould overlook, or insufficiently consider the fact that Tompkins was\r\nnow the son-in-law of Mangle Minthorne, a wealthy citizen of New York,\r\nand the leader of the Martling Men, of whose opposition he had already\r\nbeen apprised, and whose bitter hostility he was about to experience.\r\nIf he thought to disarm the enmity of Minthorne by helping the\r\nson-in-law, his hopes were raised only to be dashed to earth again.\r\n\r\nIt is certain DeWitt Clinton had no one save himself to thank for\r\ntaking this Hercules, whose political direction was conspicuously\r\ninevitable from the first. But Clinton wanted an assured victor\r\nagainst Morgan Lewis and the Livingstons, with their Federalist\r\nsupporters, and, although some people inclined to the opinion that\r\nTompkins had already been promoted too rapidly, Clinton believed his\r\nservices on the bench had made him the most available man in the\r\nparty. For three years this young judge, substituting sympathy for\r\nseverity, had endeared himself to all who knew him. The qualities of\r\nfairness and fitness which Greek wisdom praised in the conduct of life\r\nwere characteristic of his life. From what we know of his work it is\r\nfair to presume, had he tarried upon the bench until 1821, he would\r\nhave been a worthy associate of Smith Thompson and Ambrose Spencer.\r\n\r\nSixty-five Republican members of the Legislature signed the address,\r\ndrawn by DeWitt Clinton, putting Tompkins into the race for governor;\r\nforty-five indorsed the platform on which Governor Lewis stood for\r\nre-election. The Clinton address gave no reason for preferring\r\nTompkins to Lewis, but the latter's weakness as an executive,\r\nforeshadowed a defeat which each day made plainer, and when the votes,\r\ncounted on the last day of April, gave Tompkins 4085 majority, the\r\nresult was as gratifying to Clinton as it was disastrous to\r\nLewis.[153] It was not a sweeping victory, such as Lewis had won over\r\nBurr three years before, for the former's weakness was less offensive\r\nthan the latter's wickedness, but it launched the successful candidate\r\non his long period of authority, which was not to be ended until he\r\nwas broken in health, if not in character.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: Daniel D. Tompkins, 35,074; Morgan Lewis,\r\n30,989.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nDaniel D. Tompkins had the good fortune to begin his administration at\r\na time when England and the United States were about to quarrel over\r\nthe former's insistence on impressing American seamen into its\r\nservice, thus giving the people something to think about save offices,\r\nand dividing them again sharply into two parties. Indeed, while the\r\nelection was pending in April, three deserters from the _Melampus_, a\r\nBritish sloop-of-war, by enlisting on the _Chesapeake_, a United\r\nStates frigate of thirty-eight guns, became the innocent cause of\r\nsubjecting the United States to gross insult. The American government,\r\nsmarting under England's impressment of its seamen, refused to\r\nsurrender these deserters, inquiries showing that they were coloured\r\nmen of American birth, two of whom had been pressed into the British\r\nservice from an American vessel in the Bay of Biscay. When the\r\n_Chesapeake_ sailed, therefore, the _Leopard_, an English man-of-war\r\nmounting fifty guns, followed her to the high seas and demanded a\r\nreturn of the deserters. Receiving a prompt refusal, the Englishman\r\nraked the decks of the _Chesapeake_ for the space of twelve minutes,\r\nkilling three men and wounding eighteen, among them the commander. The\r\n_Chesapeake_ was not yet ready for action. Her crew was undrilled in\r\nthe use of ordnance, her decks littered, appliances for reloading were\r\nwanting, and at the supreme moment neither priming nor match could be\r\nfound. Under these distressing circumstances, the boarding officer of\r\nthe _Leopard_ took the deserters and sailed for Halifax. The sight of\r\nthe dismantled _Chesapeake_, with its dead and dying, aroused the\r\npeople irrespective of party into demanding reparation or war. \"This\r\ncountry,\" wrote Jefferson, \"has never been in such a state of\r\nexcitement since the battle of Lexington.\"[154] Immediately the most\r\nexposed ports were strengthened, and the States were called upon to\r\norganise and equip 100,000 militia ready to march. Among other things,\r\nJefferson ordered British cruisers to depart from American waters,\r\nforbidding all aid and intercourse with them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: Jefferson to Colonel Taylor, August 1, 1807; _Works_,\r\nv., 148.]\r\n\r\nOn the day of Governor Tompkins' inauguration the crippled\r\n_Chesapeake_ sailed back into Norfolk; and before the New York\r\nLegislature assembled in the following January, England had published\r\nits Orders in Council, forbidding all neutral trade with France.\r\nNapoleon had also promulgated his Milan Decree, forbidding all neutral\r\ntrade with England, and the Congress of the United States, with closed\r\ndoors, in obedience to the recommendation of the President, had\r\nordered an embargo forbidding all foreign-bound American vessels to\r\nleave United States ports.\r\n\r\nFor several years American commerce, centring chiefly in New England\r\nand New York, and occupying a neutral position toward European\r\nbelligerents, had enjoyed unparalleled prosperity. Reaching all parts\r\nof the world, it had, indeed, largely engrossed the carrying trade,\r\nespecially of France and the European powers. As restraints increased,\r\nthe Yankee skippers became sly and cunning--risking capture, using\r\nneutral flags, and finding other subterfuges for new restrictions. The\r\nembargo would tie up the ships to rot, throw seamen out of employment,\r\ndestroy perishable commodities like breadstuffs, and paralyse trade.\r\nFrom the moment of its passage, therefore, merchants and shipowners\r\nresisted it, charging that Napoleon's Decree had provoked the British\r\nOrders, and that if the former would recede, the latter would be\r\nmodified. It revived the old charge of Jefferson's enmity to commerce.\r\nIn the excitement, DeWitt Clinton opposed it, and Cheetham, with his\r\nbitter, irritating pen, sustained him. He thought American commerce\r\nmight be left to solve the difficulty for itself, by allowing\r\nmerchants to arm their vessels or otherwise encounter the risks and\r\nperils at their own discretion, rather than be compelled to abandon\r\nthe highway of nations to their British rivals, whose sole purpose, he\r\nmaintained, was to drive us from the ocean and capture French supplies\r\nbeing transported in French vessels.\r\n\r\nBut the Republicans in Congress stood firmly by the embargo, holding\r\nthat if George Canning would modify the Orders in Council, which were\r\nintended to drive American commerce from the ocean, Napoleon would\r\nmodify his decrees, which were provoked by the British Orders. It was\r\nnot a question of avoiding sacrifices, said Governor Tompkins, in his\r\nspeech to the Legislature, in January, 1808, but whether one sacrifice\r\nmight not better be borne than another. The belligerents had issued\r\ndecrees regardless of our rights. If we carried for England, France\r\nwould confiscate; if for France, England would confiscate. England\r\nexacted tribute, and insisted upon the right of search; France\r\ndemanded forfeiture if we permitted search or paid tribute; between\r\nthe two the world was closed to us. But the belligerents needed our\r\nwheat and breadstuffs, and while the embargo was intended only for a\r\ntemporary expedient, giving the people time for reflection, and\r\nkeeping our vessels and cargoes from spoliation, it must prevail in\r\nthe end by making Europe feel the denial of neutral favours. \"What\r\npatriotic citizen,\" he concluded, \"will murmur at the temporary\r\nprivations and inconveniences resulting from this measure, when he\r\nreflects upon the vast expenditure of national treasure, the sacrifice\r\nof the lives of our countrymen, the total and permanent suspension of\r\ncommerce, the corruption of morals, and the distress and misery\r\nconsequent upon our being involved in the war between the nations of\r\nEurope? The evils which threaten us call for a magnanimous confidence\r\nin the efforts of our national councils to avert them, and for a firm,\r\nunanimous determination to devote everything that is dear to us to\r\nmaintain our right and national honour.\"[155]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: _Governor's Speeches._ January 26, 1808, p. 98.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Tompkins' views, sustained by decided majorities in both\r\nbranches of the Legislature, hastened DeWitt Clinton's change of\r\nattitude; and, to the great disgust of Cheetham, he now swung into\r\nline. Deceived by the first outcry against Jefferson's policy, Clinton\r\nhad presided at an opposition meeting, while Cheetham, following his\r\nlead, had assailed it in the _American Citizen_. In the same spirit\r\nGeorge Clinton, the Vice President, imprudently and impulsively\r\nattacked it in letters to his friends; but DeWitt Clinton, seeing his\r\nmistake, quickly jumped into line with his party, leaving Cheetham and\r\nhis uncle to return as best they could. It was an ungracious act,\r\nsince Cheetham, who had devoted the best of his powers in justifying\r\nthe conduct of Clinton, was now left in the air, without the means of\r\ngracefully getting down.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the new Council of Appointment, elected in February, and\r\ncontrolled by DeWitt Clinton, had reversed the work of Lewis. Marinus\r\nWillett surrendered the mayoralty to DeWitt Clinton, Maturin\r\nLivingston gave up the recordership, Thomas Tillotson turned over the\r\nsecretaryship of state to Elisha Jenkins, Sylvanus Miller again became\r\nsurrogate of New York, and John Woodworth was dismissed from the\r\noffice of attorney-general. Under the Constitution, the Legislature\r\nelected the treasurer of the State, an office which Abraham G.\r\nLansing, brother of the Chancellor and father of Garrett, had held\r\ncontinuously since the defalcation of McClanan in 1803. Lansing was\r\nwealthy, and, like his brother, a man of the highest character for\r\nintegrity and correct business methods, but he had followed Lewis to\r\ndefeat and now paid the penalty by giving place to David Thomas, who,\r\nlike McClanan, was also to prove a defaulter. Thus, within a year\r\nafter Tompkins' inauguration, an entire change of persons holding\r\ncivil offices in the State had taken place, the Governor shrewdly\r\nstrengthening himself by assuming to have helped the winners, and\r\nweakening Clinton by permitting the disappointed to charge their\r\nfailure to the Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of a Republican candidate to succeed Jefferson, gave\r\nTompkins further opportunity of strengthening himself at the expense\r\nof DeWitt Clinton. For months the latter had been urging the claims of\r\nGeorge Clinton for President, on the ground of the Vice President's\r\nhitherto undisputed right to promotion, and because Virginia had held\r\nthe office long enough. But a congressional caucus, greatly to the\r\ndisgust of Monroe and the Clintons, and without the knowledge of the\r\nVice President, hastily got together according to the custom of the\r\nday and nominated James Madison for President and George Clinton for\r\nVice President. The disappointed friends of Monroe and Clinton charged\r\nthat the caucus was irregular, only eighty-nine out of one hundred and\r\nthirty-nine Republican representatives and senators having attended\r\nit, and could they have agreed upon a candidate among themselves\r\nMadison must have been beaten. Leading Federalists waited until late\r\nin April for DeWitt Clinton to make some arrangement which their party\r\nmight support, but, while Federalists waited, the threatened\r\nRepublican bolt wasted itself in a fruitless endeavour to unite upon a\r\ncandidate for first place. Monroe's friends would not have George\r\nClinton, whom they pronounced too old and too infirm, and Clinton's\r\nfriends declined to accept Monroe, who was objectionable, if for no\r\nother reason, because he was a Virginian. Finally, the Federalists\r\nnominated Charles C. Pinckney of South Carolina for President and\r\nRufus King of New York for Vice President, making Madison's election\r\nabsolutely certain.\r\n\r\nThis ought to have ended the strife in Republican ranks. Under similar\r\ncircumstances any ordinary politician would have hastened to\r\nre-establish himself with his party. But DeWitt Clinton, carrying the\r\ncontest to the New York Legislature, called to appoint presidential\r\nelectors, insisted that the vote of the State be given to his uncle.\r\nThe strong affection for the venerable statesman insured the\r\nsuggestion favourable consideration by a large portion of the\r\nRepublican party, but Tompkins assailed it with unanswerable\r\nargument. Without being of the slightest use to George Clinton, he\r\ncontended, such a course would exhibit an unhappy division in\r\nRepublican ranks, excite the jealousy of Madison's friends, impair the\r\ninfluence of New York Republicans with the Administration, and make\r\nthem appear ridiculous to their brethren in other States. This was the\r\ntalk of a wise politician. The contest was squarely between James\r\nMadison, regularly nominated by the method then accepted, and Charles\r\nC. Pinckney, the candidate of the Federalists; and a vote for Clinton\r\nmeant a Republican vote thrown away out of pique. DeWitt Clinton\r\nunderstood this; but he could not curb a disposition to have things\r\nhis way, and, upon his insistence, it was finally agreed that each\r\nelector should vote his preference. Under this arrangement, George\r\nClinton received six votes out of the nineteen, Ambrose Spencer\r\nleading the minority. Of the votes cast for President, Madison\r\nreceived 122, Clinton 6, and Pinckney 48; for Vice President, George\r\nClinton had 113, Rufus King 48, John Langdon of New Hampshire 9, and\r\nMadison and Monroe three each, the votes of Judge Spencer and his five\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nWithin a twelvemonth DeWitt Clinton had plainly made a series of\r\nserious mistakes. He had opposed the embargo, he had antagonised\r\nMadison, who still resented the Clintons' opposition to the Federal\r\nConstitution, and he had forced a discovery of Tompkins' superior\r\nmanagement and political wisdom. To add to his embarrassment, the\r\nLewisites, the Burrites, and the Martling Men now openly charged him\r\nwith hostility to Madison and with insincere support of Jefferson and\r\nTompkins, since he continued on friendly terms with Cheetham, who\r\nstill bitterly opposed the embargo. If these three political groups of\r\nmen, having a bond of union in their common detestation of DeWitt\r\nClinton, could have found a leader able to marshal them, they must\r\nhave compassed the latter's political overthrow long before he\r\nprostrated himself. Already it was whispered that Tompkins approved\r\ntheir attacks, a suspicion that found many believers, since Minthorne\r\nhad set to work to destroy Clinton. But the Governor was too wise to\r\nbe drawn openly into gladiatorial relations with DeWitt Clinton at\r\nthis time, although, as it afterward appeared, Madison and Tompkins\r\neven then had an understanding to which Clinton was by no means a\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nClinton, however, continued seemingly on good terms with Tompkins; and\r\nto disprove the attacks of the Martling Men he introduced a series of\r\nresolutions in the State Senate, to which he had been elected in the\r\npreceding April, approving the administration of President Madison and\r\npledging support to Governor Tompkins. To make his defence the more\r\ncomplete, he backed the resolutions with an elaborately prepared\r\nspeech, in which he bitterly assailed the Federalists, who, he\r\ndeclared, thought it \"better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.\"\r\nClinton may be excused for getting in accord with his party; but since\r\nhis change disclosed an absence of principle, it was bad manners, to\r\nsay the least, to denounce, with Miltonic quotation, those who\r\nconsistently held to the views formerly entertained by himself. Of\r\nClinton it could scarcely be said, that he was a favourite in the\r\nLegislature. He frequently allowed his fierce indignation to get the\r\nbetter of his tongue. His sharp sarcasms, his unsparing ridicule, and\r\nhis heedless personalities, sometimes withered the effect of his\r\noratory; yet it is quite certain that the fury of his assaults and the\r\nexuberance of his anger aroused the keenest interest, and that when\r\nthe Martling Men finally prevented his return to the Legislature his\r\nabsence was generally regretted.\r\n\r\nClinton's speech did not convince Federalists that embargo was the\r\nproduct of profound statesmanship. Abraham Van Vechten, the leader of\r\nthe Federalists in the Legislature, was a powerful and logical\r\nreasoner, and an orator of singular eloquence. His success as an\r\nadvocate at the bar followed him to the Assembly, and in every debate\r\nhe proved a formidable antagonist. He had a gift of sarcasm that made\r\nan adversary exceedingly uncomfortable; and as he shattered the\r\nreasoning of Clinton, he exposed the imperious and domineering\r\ntrimmer to ridicule and jest. Van Vechten ranked among the ablest men\r\nof New York. His tall, erect, and dignified figure was well known\r\nthroughout the State, and although he did not assume to lead his\r\nparty, the Federalists recognised his right to share in its\r\nleadership. Governor Jay offered him a place on the Supreme bench; but\r\nhe preferred the bar and the brief sessions of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nBy the side of Van Vechten sat Daniel Cady, at that time thirty-six\r\nyears of age, already renowned as a lawyer, the rival of Ogden Hoffman\r\nand Marcus T. Reynolds, and, in the estimation of his contemporaries,\r\none of the most generous and gifted men of his time. Three terms in\r\nthe Legislature and one in Congress measured, until his election to\r\nthe Supreme Court in 1847, his career in public life; but brief as was\r\nthis service, his great ability adorned the State and strengthened his\r\nparty. His distinguished daughter, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, whose\r\nachievements covered more than half of the last century, represented\r\nin a marked degree his gifts, his accomplishments, and the sweetness\r\nof his nature.\r\n\r\nUnder the lead of Van Vechten and Cady, the Federalists tormented\r\nDeWitt Clinton and the friends of embargo, by contrasting the busy\r\nwharves in 1807, covered with bales of cotton, barrels of flour, and\r\nhogsheads of sugar, with the stagnation that characterised all avenues\r\nof commerce in 1809. Ropewalks were deserted, sailmakers idle, draymen\r\nwithout business, and sailors without bread. If England bled, they\r\ndeclared, the United States bled faster. An ocean whitened with\r\nAmerican sails had been turned over to British ships which were\r\nabsorbing the maritime trade. France showed an indifference to\r\nAmerica's commerce and England boasted an independence of America's\r\ntrade. As a weapon of coercion, exclaimed Cady, embargo has been a\r\nfailure--as a measure of defence it has been suicidal. What would\r\nhappen if our ships were suffered to go to Europe and the Indies? Some\r\nwould reach Europe and find a market; others would go to England,\r\nobtain a license to sail to a Baltic port, and then sell at great\r\nprofit. Out of a hundred ships, two would probably be seized by the\r\nFrench. Better to lose two by seizure than the destruction of all by\r\nembargo.\r\n\r\nObadiah German had much to say in defence of the justice and prudence\r\nof the embargo. There was nothing brilliant about German; but ample\r\nevidence of his parliamentary ability lines the pathway of his public\r\ncareer. Without eloquence or education, he had the full courage of his\r\nconvictions and an intellectual vigour sufficient to back them. He\r\ncame to the Legislature in 1798, and, in 1809, very unexpectedly\r\nsucceeded Samuel L. Mitchill as United States senator. Later he served\r\none term as speaker of the Assembly. Just now he was the recognised\r\nleader of the Republican majority in that body, and in his wise,\r\nuncouth way dealt many a hard blow with telling effect.\r\n\r\nNathan Sanford also assisted in repelling the assaults of Cady and Van\r\nVechten. Sanford was the pet of the Martling Men and the enemy of\r\nDeWitt Clinton. He had been appointed United States attorney upon the\r\nresignation of Edward Livingston in 1803, holding the office until his\r\nelection to the United States Senate to succeed Obadiah German in\r\n1815. In the meantime he served two terms in the Assembly, one of them\r\nas speaker, and three terms in the State Senate. Afterward, he became\r\nchancellor for two or three years, and then took another term as\r\nUnited States senator. His activity gave him strength, and his loyalty\r\nto the Martling Men, now known as Tammany, supplied him with backers\r\nenough to keep him continuously in office for thirty years. Despite\r\nhis titles of Senator and Chancellor, however, and his long public\r\nservice, he did not leave a memory for eloquence, scholarship, or for\r\ngreat ability; though he was a ready talker and a willing friend,\r\nquick to catch the favouring breeze and ready to adopt any political\r\nmethod that promised success. In upholding embargo, Sanford admitted\r\nits seriousness, but emphasised its necessity. He recalled how England\r\nhad searched our ships, impressed our seamen, killed our citizens,\r\nand insulted our towns. The ocean, he argued, had become a place of\r\nrobbery and national disgrace, since Great Britain, by its orders in\r\nCouncil, had provoked France into promulgating the Berlin Decree of\r\nNovember, 1806, and the Milan Decree of December, 1807, which\r\ndenationalised any ship that touched an English port, or suffered an\r\nEnglish search, or paid an English tax--whether it entered a French\r\nport, or fell into the power of a French privateer. Thus, since\r\nEngland had blockaded one-half of Europe and France the other half, he\r\nthought it time for dignified retirement, until England felt the need\r\nof additional supplies, and France awoke to the loss of its luxuries.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the spirited debate, DeWitt Clinton's resolutions were\r\nadopted by both houses--in the Senate without a division; in the\r\nAssembly by a vote of sixty-one to forty-one. But almost before the\r\nresult was announced, American wheat dropped from two dollars to\r\nseventy cents a bushel, turning the election of April, 1809, into a\r\nFederalist victory. It was a great surprise to Tompkins and his party,\r\nwhose only gleam of hope grew out of the failure of the Federalists to\r\nreturn senators from the middle and eastern districts, thus\r\npreventing, as they assumed, a Federalist majority in the new Council\r\nof Appointment and a wholesale removal of Republican officials. But\r\nthe Federalists understood their work. After welcoming to the\r\nspeakership their old friend, William North of Duansburgh, who had\r\nserved in the same capacity in 1795 and again in 1796, the Assembly\r\nelected to the Council, two Federalists and two Republicans, including\r\nRobert Williams of the middle district. Williams had been a Lewisite,\r\na Burrite, and a Clintonian. With the help of a Federalist governor in\r\n1799, he became sheriff of Dutchess County, and, although he bore the\r\nreputation of a trimmer, he seems to have concealed the real baseness\r\nof his character until the meeting of the new Council, when his\r\ncasting vote turned out of office every Republican in the State. By\r\nthis treachery his son-in-law, Thomas J. Oakley, of whom we shall hear\r\nmuch hereafter, became surrogate of Dutchess County; Jacob Radcliff,\r\nthe great chancery lawyer, mayor of New York; Abraham Van Vechten,\r\nattorney-general, and Abraham G. Lansing, treasurer of state. From the\r\nmoment of his apostacy Robert Williams, classified by his neighbours\r\nwith Judas Iscariot and ignored by men of all parties, passed into\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTOMPKINS DEFEATS JONAS PLATT\r\n\r\n1810\r\n\r\n\r\nThough DeWitt Clinton again lost the mayoralty of New York, he was\r\nstill in the Senate; and to maintain an appearance of friendship with\r\nthe Governor, he wrote the address to the people, signed by the\r\nRepublican members of the Legislature, placing Tompkins in the race\r\nfor re-election. The Federalists, encouraged by their gains in April,\r\n1809, had with confidence nominated Jonas Platt for governor, and\r\nNicholas Fish for lieutenant-governor. Fish is little known to the\r\npresent generation except as the father of Hamilton Fish, the able\r\nsecretary of state in President Grant's Cabinet; but in his day\r\neverybody knew of him, and everybody admitted his capacity and\r\npatriotism. His distinguished gallantry during the Revolution won him\r\nthe confidence of Washington and the intimate friendship of Hamilton,\r\nafter whom he named his illustrious son. For many years he was\r\nadjutant-general of the State, president of the New York Society of\r\nthe Cincinnati, and a representative Federalist. It is said that Aaron\r\nBurr felt rebuked in his presence, because he recognised in him those\r\nhigh qualities of noble devotion to principle which the grandson of\r\nJonathan Edwards well knew were wanting in his own character. Just now\r\nFish was fifty-two years old, a member of the New York Board of\r\nAldermen, and an inveterate opponent of Republicanism, chafing under\r\nDeWitt Clinton's dictatorship in the State and Tammany's control in\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nJonas Platt had borne an important part in propping up falling\r\nFederalism. He was a born fighter. Though somewhat uncouth in\r\nexpression and unrefined in manner, he had won for himself a proud\r\nposition at the bar of his frontier home, and was rapidly writing his\r\nname high on the roll of New York statesmen. He had proved his\r\npopularity by carrying his senatorial district in the preceding\r\nelection; and he had demonstrated his ability as a debater by replying\r\nto the arguments of DeWitt Clinton with a power that comes only from\r\nwide information and a consciousness of being in the right. He could\r\nnot be turned aside from the real issue. Whatever or whoever had\r\nprovoked the British Orders in Council, he declared, one thing was\r\ncertain, those orders could not have driven American commerce from the\r\nocean had not the embargo established British commerce in its place.\r\nThis was the weak point in the policy of Jefferson, and the strong\r\npoint in the argument of Jonas Platt. Five hundred and thirty-seven\r\nvessels, aggregating over one hundred and eighty thousand tons, had\r\nbeen tied up in New York alone; and the public revenues collected at\r\nits custom house had dropped from four and a half millions to nothing.\r\nHistory concedes that embargo, since it required a much greater\r\nsacrifice at home than it caused abroad, utterly failed as a weapon\r\nfor coercing Europe; and with redoubled energy and prodigious effect,\r\nPlatt drove this argument into the friends of the odious and\r\nprofitless measure, until the Governor's party in the election of 1809\r\nhad gone down disastrously.\r\n\r\nTo Obadiah German, a living embodiment of the Jeffersonian spirit, the\r\nmost extravagant arguments in support of the embargo came naturally\r\nand clearly. To a man of DeWitt Clinton's high order of intellect,\r\nhowever, it must have been difficult, in the presence of Jonas Platt's\r\nlogic, backed as it was by an unanswerable array of facts, to believe\r\nthat the arguments in favour of embargo were those which history would\r\napprove. As if, however, to establish Platt's position, Congress, in\r\nthe midst of the New York campaign, voted to remove the embargo, and\r\nto establish in its stead, non-intercourse with Great Britain and\r\nFrance--thus reopening trade with the rest of Europe and indulging\r\nthose merchants who desired to take the risks of capture. For the\r\nmoment, this was a great blow to Clinton and a great victory for\r\nPlatt, giving him a prestige that his party thought entitled him to\r\nthe governorship.\r\n\r\nIn the legislative session of 1810, however, Jonas Platt developed\r\nneither the strength nor the shrewdness that characterised his conduct\r\non the stump during the campaign of 1809. William Erskine, the British\r\nminister, a son of the distinguished Lord Chancellor, whose attachment\r\nto America was strengthened by marriage, had negotiated a treaty with\r\nthe United States limiting the life of the Orders in Council to June\r\n10, 1809. This treaty had been quickly disavowed by the English\r\ngovernment, and, in referring to it in his message, Governor Tompkins\r\naccused England of wilfully refusing to fulfil its stipulations. \"With\r\nGreat Britain an arrangement was effected in April last,\" wrote the\r\nGovernor, \"which diffused a lively satisfaction through the nation,\r\nand presaged a speedy restoration of good understanding and harmony\r\nbetween the two countries. But our hopes were blasted by an unexpected\r\ndisavowal of the agreement, and an unqualified refusal to fulfil its\r\nstipulations on the part of England. Since the recall of the minister\r\nwho negotiated the arrangement, nothing has occurred to brighten the\r\nprospect of an honourable adjustment of our differences. On the\r\ncontrary, instead of evincing an amicable disposition by substituting\r\nother acceptable terms of accommodation in lieu of the disavowed\r\narrangement, the new minister has persisted in impeaching the veracity\r\nof our Administration, which a sense of respect for themselves, and\r\nfor the dignity of the nation they represent, forbade them to brook.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in this statement to rebuke. Young Erskine had been\r\ndisplaced by an English minister who had acquired the reputation of\r\nbeing an edged-tool against neutral nations, a curiously narrow,\r\nhide-bound politician, whose language was as insolent as his manners\r\nwere offensive. The Governor's reference, therefore, had not been too\r\nsevere, nor had his statement overleaped the truth; yet Jonas Platt\r\nattacked it with great asperity, arraigning the national\r\nadministration and charging that the country had more cause for war\r\nwith France than with Great Britain. This was both unwise and\r\nuntenable. The Governor had aimed his criticism at France as well as\r\nat England. He spoke of one as controlling the destinies of the\r\nEuropean continent, of the other as domineering upon the ocean, and of\r\nboth as overleaping \"the settled principles of public law, which\r\nconstituted the barriers between the caprice, the avarice, or the\r\ntyranny of a belligerent, and the rights and independence of a\r\nneutral.\" But Jonas Platt, betrayed by his prejudices against\r\nJefferson and France, went on with an argument well calculated to give\r\nhis opponents an advantage. His language was strong and clear, his\r\nsarcasm pointed; but it gave DeWitt Clinton the opportunity of\r\ncharging Federalists with taking sides with the British against their\r\nown country.\r\n\r\nThere never was a time when the Federalists, as a national party, were\r\nwilling to join hands with England to the disadvantage of their\r\ncountry. They had the same reasons for disliking England that animated\r\ntheir opponents. But their antipathy to Jacobins and to Jefferson, and\r\nthe latter's partiality for France, drove them into sympathy with\r\nGreat Britain's struggle against Napoleon, until the people suspected\r\nthem of too great fondness for English institutions and English\r\nprinciples. Several events, too, seemed to justify such a suspicion,\r\nnotably the adherence of British Tories to the Federalist party, and\r\nthe latter's zeal to allay hostile feelings growing out of the\r\nRevolutionary war. To such an extent had this sentimental sympathy\r\nbeen carried, that, in the summer of 1805, the Federalists of Albany,\r\nhaving a majority in the common council, foolishly refused to allow\r\nthe Declaration of Independence to be read as a part of the exercises\r\nin celebration of the Fourth of July. Naturally, such a policy quickly\r\naroused every inherited and cultivated prejudice against the British,\r\nstrengthening the belief that the Federalists, as a party, were\r\nwilling to suppress the patriotic utterances of their own countrymen\r\nrather than injure the feelings of America's hereditary foe.\r\n\r\nWhen DeWitt Clinton, therefore, charged the party of Jonas Platt with\r\ntaking the side of the British against their own country, the debate\r\nrevived old tales of cruelty and massacre, growing out of England's\r\nalliance with the Indians in the early days of the Revolution; and it\r\ngave John Taylor opportunity to recount the horrors which he had\r\nwitnessed in the days of his country's extreme peril. Taylor was\r\nsixty-eight years old. For nearly twenty years he had been a member of\r\nthe Legislature, and was soon to be lieutenant-governor for nearly ten\r\nyears more. Before the Revolutionary war, he served in the Provincial\r\nCongress; and in Arnold's expedition to Canada, in 1775, he had\r\nsuperintended the commissary department, contributing to the comfort\r\nof the shattered remnant who stood with Montgomery on the Plains of\r\nAbraham on that ill-fated last day of the year.\r\n\r\nTaylor was a man of undoubted integrity and great political sagacity.\r\nHis character suffered, perhaps, because a fondness for money kept\r\ngrowing with his growing years. \"For a good old gentlemanly vice,\"\r\nsays Byron, \"I think I must take up with avarice.\" Taylor did not wait\r\nto be an old gentleman before adopting \"the good old gentlemanly\r\nvice,\" but it did not seem to hurt him with the people, for he kept on\r\ngetting rich and getting office. He was formed to please. His tall,\r\nslender form, rising above the heads of those about him, made his\r\nagreeable manners and easy conversation the more noticeable, gaining\r\nhim the affection of men while challenging their admiration for his\r\nability.\r\n\r\nIn 1760, Taylor had followed the British army to Oswego, and there\r\nacquired a knowledge of the Indian language. He knew of the alliance\r\nbetween the British and Indians in 1776, and had witnessed the\r\nhorrible massacres growing out of these treaty relations. The most\r\ntragic stories of Indian atrocities begin with the payment of bounties\r\nby the British for the scalps of women and children, and for the\r\ncapture of men and boys who would make soldiers. Often guided by\r\nTories, the fierce Mohawks sought out the solitary farmhouse, scalped\r\nthe helpless, and, with a few prisoners, started back on their lonely\r\nreturn journey to Canada, hundreds of miles through the forest, simply\r\nto receive the promised reward of a few Spanish dollars from their\r\nBritish allies. When DeWitt Clinton, therefore, charged the\r\nFederalists with loving the English more than their own country, John\r\nTaylor won the Senate by recalling Indian atrocities set on foot by\r\nBritish officers, and often carried out with the assistance of British\r\nTories, now members of the Federalist party. Daniel Parrish, a senator\r\nfrom the eastern district, having more courage than eloquence, came to\r\nPlatt's support with the most exact and honest skill, repelling the\r\ninsinuations of Clinton, and indignantly denying Taylor's tactful\r\nargument. But when Taylor, pointing his long, well-formed index finger\r\nat the eastern senator, expressed surprise and grief to hear one plead\r\nthe English cause whose father had been foully murdered by an Indian\r\nwhile under British pay and British orders, Parrish lost his temper\r\nand Platt his cause.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad day for Platt. So successfully did Taylor revive the old\r\nRevolutionary hatred of the British that the Herkimer statesman's\r\narraignment of Governor Tompkins, offered as a substitute for DeWitt\r\nClinton's friendly answer, was rejected by a vote of twenty-three to\r\nsix. Coming as it did on the eve of the gubernatorial election it was\r\ntoo late to retrieve his lost position. Moreover, the repeal of the\r\nembargo had materially weakened the Federalists and correspondingly\r\nstrengthened the Republicans, since the commerce of New York quickly\r\nrevived, giving employment to the idle and bread to the hungry. The\r\nconviction deepened, also, that a Republican administration was\r\nsincerely impartial in sentiment between the two belligerents, and\r\nthat the present foreign policy, ineffective as it might be, fitted\r\nthe emergency better than a bolder one. Added to this, was the keen\r\ndesire of the Republicans to recover the offices which had been lost\r\nthrough the apostacy of Robert Williams; and although the Federalists\r\nstruggled like drowning men to hold their ill-gotten gains, the strong\r\nanti-British sentiment, backed by a determination to approve the\r\npolicy of Madison, swept the State, re-electing Governor Tompkins by\r\nsix thousand majority[156] and putting both branches of the\r\nLegislature in control of the Republicans. Surely, Jonas Platt was\r\nnever to be governor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: Daniel D. Tompkins, 43,094; Jonas Platt,\r\n36,484.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nIn the heated temper of the triumphant party, the new Council of\r\nAppointment, chosen soon after the Legislature convened in January,\r\n1811, began removing officials with a fierceness that in our day would\r\nhave brought shame and ruin upon any administration. It was a Clinton\r\nCouncil, and only Clintonians took office. Jacob Radcliff again turned\r\nover the New York mayoralty to DeWitt Clinton; Abraham Van Vechten\r\ngave up the attorney-generalship to Matthias B. Hildreth; Daniel Hale\r\nsurrendered the secretaryship of state to Elisha Jenkins; Theodore\r\nV.W. Graham bowed his adieus to the recordership of Albany as John Van\r\nNess Yates came in; and James O. Hoffman, Cadwallader D. Colden, and\r\nJohn W. Mulligan, as recorder, district attorney, and surrogate of New\r\nYork, respectively, hastened to make way for their successors. As soon\r\nas an order could reach him, Thomas J. Oakley, surrogate of Dutchess\r\nCounty, vacated the office that the treachery of his father-in-law had\r\nbrought him. It was another clean sweep throughout the entire State.\r\nEven Garrett T. Lansing, because he once belonged to the Lewisites,\r\nfound the petty office of master in chancery catalogued among the\r\n\"spoils.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nDeWITT CLINTON AND TAMMANY\r\n\r\n1789-1811\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Lieutenant-Governor Broome, in the summer of 1810,\r\ncreated a vacancy which the Legislature provided should be filled at\r\nthe following election in April. John Broome had been distinguished\r\nsince the olden days when the cardinal policy of New York was the\r\nunion of the Colonies in a general congress. He had belonged to the\r\nCommittee of Fifty-one with John Jay, to the Committee of One Hundred\r\nwith James Duane, and to the Committee of Observation with Philip\r\nLivingston. After the Revolution, he became president of the Board of\r\nAldermen, treasurer of the Chamber of Commerce, and, in 1789, had\r\nstood for Congress against James Lawrence, the trusted adjutant-general\r\nof Washington. Although Broome's overwhelming defeat for Congress in\r\nno wise reflected upon his character as a patriot and representative\r\ncitizen, it kept him in the background until the Federalists had\r\nfrittered away their power in New York City. Then he came to the front\r\nagain, first as state senator, and afterward, in 1804, as\r\nlieutenant-governor; but he never reached the coveted governorship. In\r\nthat day, as in this, the office of lieutenant-governor was not\r\nnecessarily a stepping stone to higher preferment. Pierre Van\r\nCortlandt served with fidelity for eighteen years without getting the\r\nlong wished-for promotion; Morgan Lewis jumped over Jeremiah Van\r\nRensselaer in 1804; and Daniel D. Tompkins was preferred to John\r\nBroome in 1807. Indeed, with the exception of Enos T. Throop, Hamilton\r\nFish, David B. Hill, and Frank W. Higgins, none of the worthy men who\r\nhave presided with dignity over the deliberations of the State Senate\r\nhave ever been elected governor.\r\n\r\nDeWitt Clinton now wished to succeed Broome; and a large majority of\r\nRepublican legislators quickly placed him in nomination. Clinton had\r\nfirst desired to return to Albany as senator, as he would then have\r\npossessed the right to vote and to participate in debate. But the\r\nMartling Men, who held the balance of power, put forward Morgan Lewis,\r\nhis bitterest enemy. It was a clever move on the part of the\r\nex-Governor. Clinton had literally driven Lewis from the party, and\r\nfor three years his name remained a reminiscence; but, with the\r\nassistance of Tammany, he now got out of obscurity by getting onto the\r\nticket with Governor Tompkins. To add, too, to Clinton's chagrin,\r\nTammany also put up Nathan Sanford for the Assembly, and thus closed\r\nagainst him the door of the Legislature. But to carry out his\r\nambitious scheme--of mounting to the Presidency in 1812--Clinton\r\nneeded to be in Albany to watch his enemies; and, although he cared\r\nlittle for the lieutenant-governorship, the possession of it would\r\nfurnish an excuse for his presence at the state capital.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of DeWitt Clinton's nomination raised the most\r\nearnest outcries among the Martling Men. They had endeavoured to\r\ndefeat his reappointment to the mayoralty; but their wild protests had\r\nfallen upon deaf ears. Indeed, the hatred of Minthorne, the intriguing\r\ngenius of Teunis Wortman, and the earnestness of Matthew L. Davis,\r\nseemed only to have been agencies to prepare the way for Clinton's\r\ntriumphant restoration. Now, however, these accomplished political\r\ngladiators proposed to give battle at the polls, and if their\r\ninfluence throughout the State had been as potent as it proved within\r\nthe wards of New York City, the day of DeWitt Clinton's destiny must\r\nhave been nearly over.\r\n\r\nSince its organisation in 1789, the Society of St. Tammany had been an\r\ninfluential one. It was founded for charitable purposes; its\r\nmembership was made up mostly of native Americans, and its meetings\r\nwere largely social in their character.\r\n\r\n    \"There's a barrel of porter at Tammany Hall,\r\n      And the Bucktails are swigging it all the night long;\r\n    In the time of my boyhood 'twas pleasant to call\r\n      For a seat and cigar 'mid the jovial throng.\"\r\n\r\nThus sang Fitz-Greene Halleck of the social customs that continued far\r\ninto the nineteenth century. Originally, Federalists and\r\nanti-Federalists found a welcome around Tammany's council fire; and\r\nits bucktail badge, the symbol of liberty, hung from the hat of\r\nClintonian and Hamiltonian alike. But toward the end of Washington's\r\nsecond administration the society became thoroughly partisan and\r\nthoroughly anti-Federalist, shifting its wigwam to the historic \"Long\r\nRoom,\" at the tavern of Abraham Martling, a favourite hostlery which\r\nthe Federalists contemptuously called \"the Pig-Pen.\" Then it was, that\r\nAaron Burr made Tammany a power in political campaigns. He does not\r\nseem to have been its grand sachem, or any sachem at all; nor is it\r\nknown that he ever entered its wigwam or affiliated as a member; but\r\nits leaders were his satellites, who began manufacturing public\r\nopinion, manipulating primaries, dictating nominations, and carrying\r\nwards.\r\n\r\nOut of Burr's candidacy for President sprang Tammany's long and bitter\r\nwarfare against DeWitt Clinton. The quarrel began in 1802 when Clinton\r\nand Cheetham charged Burr with intriguing to beat Jefferson; it grew\r\nin bitterness when Clinton turned Burr and the Swartouts out of the\r\ndirectorate of the Manhattan Bank; nor was it softened after the\r\nsecret compromise, made at Dyde's Hotel, in February, 1806. Indeed,\r\nfrom that moment, Tammany seemed the more determined to harass the\r\nambitious Clinton; and, although his agents, as late as 1809, sought\r\nreconciliation, the society expelled Cheetham and made Clinton an\r\nobject of detestation. Cheetham, who died in 1810, did not live to\r\nwreak full vengeance; but he did enough to arouse a shower of\r\nbrick-bats which broke the windows of his home and threatened the\r\ndemolition of the _American Citizen_.\r\n\r\nThough Cheetham's decease relieved Tammany of one of its earliest and\r\nmost vindictive assailants, the political death of DeWitt Clinton\r\nwould have been more helpful, since Clinton's opposition proved the\r\nmore harmful. As mayor he lived like a prince distributing bounty\r\nliberally among his supporters. He was lavish in the gift of lucrative\r\noffices, lavish in the loan of money, and lavish in contributions to\r\ncharity. His salary and fees were estimated at twenty thousand\r\ndollars, an extravagant sum in days when eight hundred dollars met the\r\nexpense of an average family, and the possessor of fifty thousand\r\ndollars was considered a rich man. Besides, his wife had inherited\r\nfrom her father, Walter Franklin, a wealthy member of the Society of\r\nFriends, an estate valued at forty thousand dollars, making her one of\r\nthe richest women in New York.\r\n\r\nBut Clinton had more than rich fees and a wealthy wife. The foreign\r\nelement, especially the Irish, admired him because, when a United\r\nStates senator, he had urged and secured a reduction of the period of\r\nnaturalisation from fourteen years to five; and because he relieved\r\nthe political and financial distress of their countrymen, by aiding\r\nthe repeal of the alien and sedition laws. For a score of years,\r\nAmerica had invited to its shores every fugitive from British\r\npersecution. But the heroes of 'Ninety-eight, who had escaped the\r\ngibbet, and successfully made their way to this country through the\r\ncordon of English frigates, were welcomed with laws even more\r\noffensive than the coercion acts which they had left behind. The last\r\nrebellious uprising to occur in Ireland under the Georges, had sent\r\nThomas Addis Emmet, brother of the famous and unfortunate Irish\r\npatriot, a fugitive to the land of larger liberty. To receive this\r\nbrother with laws that might send him back to death, was to despise\r\nthe national sentiment of Irishmen; and the men, Clinton declared, who\r\nhad been indisposed or unable to take account of the force of a\r\nnational sentiment, were not and never could be fit to carry on the\r\ngreat work of government.\r\n\r\nThoughtful, however, as DeWitt Clinton had been of the oppressed in\r\nother lands, he lacked what Dean Swift said Bolingbroke needed--\"a\r\nsmall infusion of the alderman.\" If he thought a man stupid he let him\r\nknow it. To those who disagreed with him, he was rude and overbearing.\r\nAll of what is known as the \"politician's art\" he professed to\r\ndespise; and while Tammany organised wards into districts, and\r\ndistricts into blocks, Clinton pinned his faith on the supremacy of\r\nintellect, and on office-holding friends. The day the news of his\r\nnomination for lieutenant-governor reached New York, Tammany publicly\r\ncharged him with attempting \"to establish in his person a pernicious\r\nfamily aristocracy;\" with making complete devotion \"the exclusive test\r\nof merit and the only passport to promotion;\" and with excluding\r\nhimself from the Republican party by \"opposing the election of\r\nPresident Madison.\" There was much truth in some of these charges.\r\nClinton had quarrelled with Aaron Burr; he had overthrown Morgan\r\nLewis; and he was ready to defeat Daniel D. Tompkins. Even Cheetham\r\nhad left him some months before his death, and Richard Riker, who\r\nacted as second in the duel with John Swartout, was soon to ignore the\r\nchilly Mayor when he passed. The estrangement of these friends is\r\npathetic, yet one gets no melancholy accounts of Clinton's troubles.\r\nThe great clamour of Tammany brought no darkening clouds into his\r\nlife. He was soon to learn that Tammany, heretofore an object of\r\ncontempt, was now a force to be reckoned with, but he did not show any\r\nqualms of uneasiness even if he felt them.\r\n\r\nTammany bolted Clinton's nomination, selecting for its candidate\r\nMarinus Willett, its most available member, and most brilliant\r\nhistoric character. Before and during the Revolution, Willett did much\r\nto make him a popular hero. He served the inefficient Abercrombie in\r\nhis unsuccessful attack on Ticonderoga in 1758; he was with the\r\nresolute Bradstreet at the brilliant charge of Fort Frontenac; he led\r\nthe historic sortie at Fort Schuyler on the 7th of August, 1777. Men\r\nwere still living who saw his furious assault upon the camp of\r\nJohnson's Greens, so sudden and sharp that the baronet himself, before\r\njoining the flight of his Indians to the depths of the thick forest,\r\ndid not have time to put on his coat, or to save the British flag and\r\nthe personal baggage of Barry St. Leger. The tale was strange enough\r\nto seem incredible to minds more sober than those of the Tammany\r\nbraves, who listened with pride to the achievements of their sachem.\r\nWith two hundred and fifty men and an iron three-pounder, Willett had\r\nfallen so unexpectedly upon the English and Indians, that the advance\r\nguard, panic-stricken, suddenly disappeared--officers, men, and\r\nsavages--leaving twenty-one wagon loads of rich spoil. This heroic\r\ndeed was a part of Willett's stock in trade, and, although he was\r\nwobbly in his politics, the people could not forget his courage and\r\ngood judgment in war. But Willett's influence was confined to the\r\nwards of a city. The rural counties believed in New York's mayor\r\nrather than in New York's hero; and when the votes were counted,\r\nClinton had a safe majority. He had fared badly in New York City,\r\nbeing deprived of more than half his votes through the popular\r\ncandidacy of Nicholas Fish; but, in spite of Tammany, he was able to\r\ngo to Albany, and to begin work upon a scheme which, until then, had\r\nbeen only a dream. It was to be a gigantic struggle. Lewis and the\r\nLivingstons opposed him, Tammany detested him, Tompkins was jealous of\r\nhim, Spencer deserted him; but he had shown he knew how to wait; and\r\nwhen waiting was over, he showed he knew how to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBANKS AND BRIBERY\r\n\r\n1791-1812\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the last century, efforts to incorporate\r\nbanks in New York were characterised by such an utter disregard of\r\nmoral methods, that the period was long remembered as a black spot in\r\nthe history of the State. Under the lead of Hamilton, Congress\r\nincorporated the United States Bank in 1791; and, inspired by his\r\nbroad financial views, the Legislature chartered the Bank of New York\r\nin the same year, the Bank of Albany in 1792, and the Bank of\r\nColumbia, located at Hudson, in 1793. These institutions soon fell\r\nunder the management of Federalists, who believed in banks and were\r\nready to aid in their establishment, so long as they remained under\r\nFederalist control.\r\n\r\nRepublicans, on the other hand, disbelieved in banks. They opposed the\r\nUnited States Bank; and by George Clinton's casting vote defeated an\r\nextension of its charter, which expired by limitation on March 4,\r\n1811. To them a bank was a combination of the rich against the poor, a\r\nmoneyed corporation whose power was a menace to free institutions, and\r\nwhose secret machinations were to be dreaded. At the same time,\r\nRepublican leaders recognised the political necessity of having\r\nRepublican banks to offset the influence of Federalist banks, and in\r\norder to overcome the deep seated prejudice of their party and to\r\ndefeat the opposition of Federalists, inducements were offered and\r\nmeans employed which unscrupulous men quickly turned into base and\r\nshameless bribery.\r\n\r\nIn his partisan zeal Burr began the practice of deception. The\r\nRepublicans needed a bank. The only one in New York City was\r\ncontrolled by the Federalists, who also controlled the Legislature,\r\nand the necessities of the rising party, if not his own financial\r\nneeds, appealed to Burr's clever management. Under the cover of\r\nchartering a company to supply pure water, and thus avoid a return of\r\nthe yellow fever which had so recently devastated the city, he asked\r\nauthority to charter the Manhattan Company, with a capital of two\r\nmillion dollars, provided \"the surplus capital might be employed in\r\nany way not inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of the United\r\nStates and of the State of New York.\" The people remembered the\r\nterrible yellow fever scourge, and the Legislature considered only the\r\nquestion of relieving the danger with pure and wholesome water; and,\r\nalthough the large capitalisation aroused suspicion in the Senate, and\r\nChief Justice Lansing called it \"a novel experiment,\"[157] the bill\r\npassed. Thus the Manhattan Bank came into existence, while wells,\r\nbrackish and unwholesome, continued the only sufficient source of\r\nwater supply.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: \"This, in the opinion of the Council, as a novel\r\nexperiment, the result whereof, as to its influence on the community,\r\nmust be merely speculative and uncertain, peculiarly requires the\r\napplication of the policy which has heretofore uniformly\r\nobtained--that the powers of corporations relative to their money\r\noperations, should be of limited instead of perpetual duration.\"--Alfred\r\nB. Street, _New York Council of Revision_, p. 423.]\r\n\r\nThat was in 1799. Four years later, the Republicans of Albany,\r\nrealising the importance of a bank and the necessity of avoiding the\r\nopposition of their own party, obtained a charter for the State Bank,\r\nby selling stock to Republican members of the Legislature, with an\r\nassurance that it could be resold at a premium as soon as the\r\ninstitution had an existence. There was a ring of money in this\r\nproposition. Such an investment meant a gift of ten or twenty dollars\r\non each share, and immediately members clamoured, intrigued, and\r\nbattled for stock. The very boldness of the proposition seemed to save\r\nit from criticism. Nothing was covered up. To put the stock at a\r\npremium there must be a bank; to make a bank there must be a charter;\r\nand to secure a charter a majority of the members must own its stock.\r\nThe result was inevitable.\r\n\r\nIt seems incredible in our day that such corruption could go on in\r\nbroad daylight without a challenge. At the present time a legislator\r\ncould not carry a district in New York if it were known that his vote\r\nhad been secured by such ill-gotten gains. Yet the methods of the\r\nRepublican promoters of the State Bank seem not to have brought a\r\nblush to the cheek of the youngest legislator. No one of prominence\r\ntook exception to it save Abraham Van Vechten, and he was less\r\nconcerned about the immorality of the thing than the competition to be\r\narrayed against the Federalist bank in Albany. Even Erastus Root, then\r\njust entering his first term in Congress, saw nothing in the\r\ntransaction to shock society's sense of propriety or to break the\r\nloftiest code of morality. \"There was nothing of mystery in the\r\npassage of the bank,\" he wrote. \"The projectors sought to push it\r\nforward by spreading the stock among the influential Republicans of\r\nthe State, including members of the Legislature, and carry it through\r\nas a party measure. It was argued by the managers of the scheme that\r\nthe stock would be above par in order to induce the members of the\r\nLegislature to go into the measure, but nothing in the transaction had\r\nthe least semblance of a corrupt influence. No one would hesitate from\r\nmotives of delicacy, to offer a member, nor for him to take, shares in\r\na bank sooner than in a turnpike or in an old canal.\"[158]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n1. Appendix, p. 583, Note J.]\r\n\r\nOne can hardly imagine Erastus Root serious in the expression of such\r\na monstrous doctrine. His life had been pure and noble. He was a\r\nsincere lover of his country; a statesman of high purpose, and of the\r\nmost commanding talents. No one ever accused him of any share in this\r\nfinancial corruption. Yet a more Machiavellian opinion could not have\r\nbeen uttered. On principle, Republican members of the Legislature\r\nopposed banks, and that principle was overcome by profits; in other\r\nwords, members must be bought, or the charter would fail. That the\r\nstock did go above par is evident from Root's keen desire to get some\r\nof it. As an influential Republican, he was allowed to subscribe for\r\nfifty shares, but when he called for it the papers could not be found.\r\nThe bank was not a bubble. It had been organised and its stock issued,\r\nbut its hook had been so well baited that the legislators left nothing\r\nfor outsiders. Subsequently the directors sent Root a certificate for\r\neight shares, and John Lamb, an assemblyman from Root's home, gave up\r\neight more; but the Delaware congressman, angry because deprived of\r\nhis fifty shares, refused to accept any. \"I had come prepared to take\r\nthe fifty,\" he wrote, \"and in a fit of more spunk than wisdom, I\r\nrejected the whole.\"[159]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n1. Appendix, p. 582, Note S.]\r\n\r\nTwo years after, in 1805, the Federalists desired to charter the\r\nMerchants' Bank of New York City. But the Legislature, largely\r\nRepublican, was led by DeWitt Clinton, now at the zenith of his power,\r\nwho resented its establishment because it must become a competitor of\r\nthe Manhattan, an institution that furnished him fat dividends and\r\nlarge influence. Clinton had undoubtedly acquired a reputation for\r\nlove of gain as well as of power, but he had never been charged, like\r\nJohn Taylor, with avarice. He spent with a lavish hand, he loaned\r\nliberally to friends, and he borrowed as if the day of payment was\r\nnever to come; yet he had no disposition to help opponents of a bank\r\nthat must cripple his control and diminish his profits. In this\r\ncontest, too, he had the active support of Ambrose Spencer, who fought\r\nthe proposed charter in the double capacity of a stockholder in the\r\nManhattan and the State, and a member of the Council of Revision.\r\nThree banks, with five millions of capital and authority to issue\r\nnotes and create debts for fifteen millions more, he argued, were\r\nenough for one city. He had something to say also about \"an alarming\r\ndecrease of specie,\" and \"an influx of bills of credit,\" which\r\n\"tended to further banish the precious metals from circulation.\"[160]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: Alfred B. Street, _New York Council of Revision_, p.\r\n427.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Lewis would have been wiser had he joined Clinton and Spencer\r\nin their opposition. But Lewis would not play second fiddle in any\r\ngame with Clinton, and so when he discovered that Clinton opposed the\r\nbank, he yielded party principle to personal prejudice and favoured\r\nit. With this powerful recruit the managers still lacked a majority,\r\nand, to influence others, Ebenezer Purdy, a Republican senator,\r\nemployed his gifts in offering his legislative associates large\r\nrewards and rich benefits. As a statesman, Purdy seems to have been\r\nwithout any guiding principle, or any principle at all. He toiled and\r\npushed and climbed, until he had landed in the Senate; then he pulled\r\nand bargained and promised until he became a member of the Council of\r\nAppointment, and, later, chairman of the legislative caucus that\r\nnominated Chancellor Lansing for governor; but not until the\r\nMerchants' Bank wanted a charter did Purdy find an opportunity to\r\ndevelop those aldermanic qualifications which distinguish him in\r\nhistory. He was getting on very well until he had the misfortune to\r\nconfide his secret to Stephen Thorn, a senator from the eastern\r\ndistrict, and Obadiah German, the well-known assemblyman from\r\nChenango, whose views were not as liberal as Erastus Root's. \"No one\r\nwould hesitate, from motives of delicacy, to offer a member shares in\r\na bank,\" said Root. This was Purdy's view also; but Thorn and German\r\nthought such an offer had the \"semblance of a corrupt influence,\" and\r\nthey made affidavits that Purdy had attempted to corrupt their votes.\r\nAccording to these affidavits the Senator promised German fifty shares\r\nof stock, with a profit of twenty dollars a share, and Thorn thirty\r\nshares, with a profit of twenty-five dollars a share. Similar\r\naffidavits were made by other members.\r\n\r\nErastus Root took exception to such transactions. \"The Merchants' Bank\r\nin 1805,\" he says, \"had powerful opposition to encounter, and, of\r\ncourse, made use of powerful means to accomplish the object. Then the\r\nshares and the assurance became down-right corruption.\"[161] But it is\r\nnot easy to observe the difference between the methods of the State\r\nBank managers, which Root affirms \"had not the least semblance of a\r\ncorrupt influence,\" and those of the Merchants' Bank, which he\r\npronounces \"down-right corruption,\" except that the one was open\r\nbribery and the other secret bribery. In either case, votes were\r\nobtained by the promise of profits. It is likely the methods of the\r\nMerchants' would have escaped notice, as did those of the State Bank,\r\nhad not Clinton, determined to beat it, complained of Purdy's bribery.\r\nThe latter resigned to escape expulsion, but the bank received its\r\ncharter. This aroused the public conscience, and in the following\r\nwinter the Legislature provided suitable punishment for the crime of\r\nbribery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n2. Appendix, p. 582.]\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1812 that any one had the hardihood to suggest\r\nanother bank. Then the Federalists sought a charter for the Bank of\r\nAmerica, with a capital of six millions, to be located in New York\r\nCity. The applicants proposed to pay the school fund four hundred\r\nthousand dollars, the literature fund one hundred thousand, and the\r\nState one hundred thousand, provided no other bank be chartered for\r\ntwenty years. In addition to this extravagant bonus, its managers\r\nagreed to loan the State one million dollars at five per cent. for the\r\nconstruction of canals, and one million to farmers at six per cent.\r\nfor the improvement of their real estate. This bold and liberal\r\nproposal recalls John Law's South Sea Bubble of the century before;\r\nfor, although the Bank of America sought no monopoly and promised the\r\npayment of no national debt, it did seem to be aiming its flight above\r\nthe clouds, since, counting the Manhattan at two, the united capital\r\nof the banks of the State did not exceed five millions. The promoters,\r\nanticipating an outcry against the incorporation of such a gigantic\r\ninstitution, employed David Thomas of Washington and Solomon Southwick\r\nof Albany to visit members of the Legislature at their homes with the\r\nhope of enlisting their active support.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if two men better equipped to supply the necessary\r\nlegislative majority could have been found in the State. Both were\r\nstalwart Republicans, possessing the confidence of DeWitt Clinton and\r\nan extensive acquaintance among local party managers. Thomas had\r\ncaution and rare sagacity. Indeed, his service of four years in the\r\nLegislature and eight years in Congress had added to his political\r\ngifts such shrewdness and craft that he did not scruple, on occasion,\r\nto postpone or hasten an event, even though such arrangement was made\r\nat the expense of some one else. This characteristic had manifested\r\nitself in the removal of Abraham G. Lansing as treasurer of state. The\r\nChancellor's brother, by long service, had won the confidence of the\r\npeople as a keeper of the State's money, and, although his family had\r\nfollowed the fortunes of Governor Lewis, it did not occur to the\r\nLegislature to dispossess him of his office until David Thomas wanted\r\na position. Then, the silent, crafty Washingtonian developed so\r\nartfully the iniquity of Lansing's political perfidy that he succeeded\r\nin obtaining the office for himself. It was because of this\r\ncraftiness, this unscrupulous use of every weapon of political\r\nwarfare, that the bank hired him. His gifts, his schemes, his faults,\r\nhis vices, were alike useful.\r\n\r\nSolomon Southwick belonged to a different type. He lacked the caution\r\nof Thomas, but nature had given him the appearance and manners which\r\nwell fitted him for the task of attracting those who came within the\r\nrange of his influence. He was singularly handsome and graceful. No\r\nstranger came near him without feeling an instant desire to know him.\r\nHe was all the more attractive because there seemed to be nothing\r\nartificial or made up about him. He had his intimates, but with an\r\nunstudied and informal dignity, he was hail-fellow with every one,\r\nkeeping none at a distance, and concealing his real feelings behind no\r\nmask of conventionalism. It was said of him at this time that he knew\r\nmore men personally than any other citizen in the State. He had been\r\nfour times elected clerk of the Assembly, he had served as sheriff of\r\nhis county, and he was now sole editor and proprietor of the Albany\r\n_Register_, the leading and most influential Republican paper. To\r\nability as a writer he also added eloquence of speech. Southwick could\r\nnot be called a great orator, but he had grace, wit, imagination, and\r\na beauty of style that appealed to the hearts and sympathies of his\r\nhearers. In the conduct of his business affairs, nobody could be more\r\ncareful, more methodical, more precise. Indeed, we may take it for\r\ngranted, without any biographical information on the subject, that in\r\n1811 Solomon Southwick was on the road to the highest honours in the\r\ngift of his State.\r\n\r\nBut his connection with the Bank of America covered him with suspicion\r\nfrom which he never entirely recovered. It must have occurred to him,\r\nwhen accepting the bank's retainer, that his opposition to the\r\nMerchants' Bank would be recalled to the injury of his consistency. In\r\n1805, he had boldly declared in the _Register_ that any Republican who\r\nvoted for a Federalist bank was justly censurable; in 1812, he so far\r\nchanged his mind as to hold that any one \"who supports or opposes a\r\nbank upon the grounds of Federalism or Republicanism, is either\r\ndeceiver or deceived, and will not be listened to by any man of sense\r\nor experience.\" A little later in the contest, when partisan fury and\r\npublic corruption were the opposing forces, several sub-agents of the\r\nbank were indicted for bribery, among them a former clergyman who was\r\nsent to the penitentiary. Then it was whispered that David Thomas,\r\nfollowing the example of Purdy in 1805, had scattered his\r\npurchase-money everywhere, sowing with the sack and not with the hand.\r\nFinally, Casper M. Rouse, a senator from Chenango, accused Thomas of\r\noffering him ten shares of stock, with a profit of one thousand\r\ndollars, adding that Thomas had told him to call upon Southwick in\r\nAlbany. Southwick had evidently fallen into bad company, and, although\r\nRouse disclaimed having seen the Albany journalist, a week or two\r\nlater Alexander Sheldon, speaker of the Assembly, made a charge\r\nagainst Southwick similar to Rouse's accusation against Thomas. Both\r\nmen were indicted, but the jury preferred accepting the denial of the\r\ndefendants, since it appeared that Rouse and Sheldon, instead of\r\ntreating the accused as bribers and men unworthy of confidence, had\r\nmaintained their former relations with them, subsequently voting for\r\nThomas for treasurer of state, and for Southwick as regent of the\r\nState University. As positive proof of bribery was limited in each\r\ncase to the prosecuting witness, we may very well accept the\r\ndefendants' repeated declarations of their own integrity and\r\nuprightness, although the conditions surrounding them were too\r\npeculiar not to leave a stigma upon their memory.\r\n\r\nThese charges of crime, added to the bank's possession of a solid\r\nmajority in both branches of the Legislature, aroused the opposition\r\ninto a storm of indignation and resentment. Governor Tompkins had\r\nanticipated its coming, and in a long, laboured message, warned\r\nmembers to beware of the methods of bank managers. Such institutions,\r\nhe declared, \"facilitate forgeries, drain the country of specie,\r\ndiscourage agriculture, swallow up the property of insolvents to the\r\ninjury of other creditors, tend to the subversion of government by\r\nvesting in the hands of the wealthy and aristocratic classes powerful\r\nengines to corrupt and subdue republican notions, relieve the wealthy\r\nstockholder from an equal share of contribution to the public service,\r\nand proportionally enhance the tax on the hard earnings of the farmer,\r\nmechanic and labourer.\" He spoke of the \"intrigue and hollow\r\npretences\" of applicants, insisting that the gratification of\r\npoliticians ought not to govern them, nor the \"selfish and\r\ndemoralising distribution of the stock.\" \"Nor ought we to be\r\nunmindful,\" he continued, \"that the prominent men who seek the\r\nincorporation of new banks, are the very same men who have deeply\r\nparticipated in the original stock of most of the previously\r\nestablished banks. Having disposed of that stock at a lucrative\r\nadvance, and their avidity being sharpened by repeated gratification,\r\nthey become more importunate and vehement in every fresh attempt to\r\nobtain an opportunity of renewing their speculations.\" As if this were\r\nnot reason enough, he exhorted them not to be deceived by the apparent\r\nunanimity of sentiment about the capital, since it \"is no real\r\nindication of the sentiments of the community at large,\" but so to\r\nlegislate as \"to retain and confirm public confidence, not only in the\r\nwisdom, but also in the unbending independence and unsullied integrity\r\nof the Legislature.\"[162]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: _Governors' Speeches_, January 28, 1812, pp. 115-8.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor's arguments were supplemented by others from Ambrose\r\nSpencer, whose bank holdings seemed more likely than ever to suffer if\r\nthis gigantic combination succeeded. Spencer's opposition to the\r\nMerchants' Bank in 1805 had been earnest, but now his whole soul was\r\naflame. To counteract the influence of Southwick's _Register_, he\r\nestablished the Albany _Republican_, which ceased to exist at the end\r\nof the campaign, but which, during its brief life, struck at every\r\nhead that favoured the bank. Its editorials, following the line of his\r\nobjections in the Council of Revision, lifted into prominence the\r\ninjurious effect likely to flow from such an alarming extension of\r\nbanking capital at a time when foreign commerce was stagnant, and when\r\nthe American nation was on the eve of a war in defence of its\r\ncommercial rights. This was mixed with a stronger personal refrain,\r\ndiscovering the danger to his bank-holdings and revealing the\r\nintensity of a nature not yet inured to defeat. A bank controlling\r\nthree times as much capital as any other, he argued, with unlimited\r\npower to establish branches throughout the State, must be a constant\r\nmenace to minor institutions, which were established under the\r\nconfidence of governmental protection and upon the legislative faith\r\nthat no further act should impair or destroy their security. \"A power\r\nthus unlimited,\" he declared, \"may be exercised not only to prejudice\r\nthe interests, but to control the operations, destroy the\r\nindependence, and impair the security of every bank north of the city\r\nof New York. A bill thus improvisory and alarming, giving undefined\r\nand unnecessary powers, and leaving the execution of those powers to a\r\nfew individuals, would materially weaken the confidence of the\r\ncommunity in the justice, wisdom, and foresight of the Legislature.\"[163]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: Alfred B. Street, _New York Council of Revision_, p.\r\n432.]\r\n\r\nWith Tompkins and Spencer stood John Taylor, whose fear for his stock\r\nin the State Bank, of which he was president, made his opposition more\r\nconspicuous than it appeared in 1805, when he assaulted Purdy,\r\nknocking him down as he left the senate chamber; but in this contest,\r\nhe did not strike or threaten. He moved among his associates in the\r\nSenate with the grace of a younger man, his tall, spare form bending\r\nlike a wind-swept tree as he reasoned and coaxed. In the same group of\r\nzealous opponents belonged Erastus Root, who had just entered the\r\nSenate, and whose speech against the Bank of America was distinguished\r\nfor its suppressed passion and its stern severity. He had waked up, at\r\nlast, to the scandalous barter in bank charters.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one Republican in Albany whose course excited more\r\nserious censure than was meted out to all others. At a moment when the\r\nmethods of bank managers aroused the most bitter hostility of his\r\nclosest political allies, DeWitt Clinton became conspicuous by his\r\nsilence. At heart he opposed the Bank of America as bitterly as\r\nAmbrose Spencer and for the same reasons; nor did he recognise any\r\ndifference in the conditions surrounding it and those which existed in\r\n1805 when he drove Ebenezer Purdy from the Senate; but, consumed with\r\na desire to get a legislative indorsement for President, before\r\nMadison secured a congressional nomination, he refused to take sides,\r\nsince the bank people, who dominated the Legislature, refused such an\r\nindorsement until the passage of their charter. In vain did Spencer\r\nthreaten and Taylor plead. He would vote, Clinton said, against the\r\nbank if opportunity presented, but he would not be drawn into the\r\nbitter contest; he would not denounce Southwick; he would not judge\r\nThomas; he would not even venture to criticise the bank. For fourteen\r\nyears Clinton and Spencer had been fast political friends; but now,\r\nat the supreme moment of Clinton's ambition, these brothers-in-law\r\nwere to fall under the guidance of different stars.\r\n\r\nGovernor Tompkins, whose desire to enter the White House no longer\r\nveiled itself as a secret, understood the purpose and importance of\r\nClinton's silence, and to give President Madison an advantage, he used\r\na prerogative, only once exercised under the Constitution of 1777, to\r\nprorogue the Legislature for sixty days. Ostensibly he did it to\r\ndefeat the bank; in reality he desired the defeat of Clinton. It is\r\nnot easy to appreciate the wild excitement that followed the\r\nGovernor's act. It recalled the days of the provincial governors, when\r\nEngland's hand rested heavily upon the liberties of the people; and\r\nthe friends of the bank joined in bitter denunciation of such a\r\ndespotic use of power. Meantime, a congressional caucus renominated\r\nMadison. But whatever the forced adjournment did for Clinton, it in no\r\nwise injured the bank, which was chartered as soon as the Legislature\r\nreassembled on May 21.\r\n\r\nWhile the Bank of America was engrossing the attention of the\r\nLegislature and the nomination of a presidential candidate convulsed\r\nCongress, George Clinton closed his distinguished career at Washington\r\non the 20th of April, 1812. If he left behind him a memory of long\r\nservice which had been lived to his own advantage, it was by no means\r\nlived to the disadvantage of his country or his State. He did much for\r\nboth. Perhaps he was better fitted for an instrument of revolution\r\nthan a governor of peace, but the influence which he exercised upon\r\nhis time was prodigious. In the two great events of his life--the\r\nrevolt of the Colonies and the adoption of a Federal Constitution--he\r\nundoubtedly swayed the minds of his countrymen to a degree unequalled\r\namong those contemporaries who favoured independence and state\r\nsupremacy. He lacked the genius of Hamilton, the scholarly, refined\r\nintegrity of Jay, and the statesmanship of both; but he was by odds\r\nthe strongest, ablest, and most astute man of his party in the State.\r\nJay and Hamilton looked into the future, Clinton saw only the present.\r\nThe former possessed a love for humanity and a longing for progress\r\nwhich encouraged them to work out a national existence, broad enough\r\nand strong enough to satisfy the ambition of a great nation a century\r\nafter its birth; Clinton was satisfied to conserve what he had,\r\nunmoved by the great possibilities even then indistinctly outlined to\r\nthe eye of the statesman whose vision was fixed intently upon an\r\nundivided America. But Clinton wisely conserved what was given to his\r\nkeeping. As he grew older he grew more tolerant and humane,\r\nsubstituting imprisonment for the death penalty, and recommending a\r\ncomplete revision of the criminal laws. His administration, too, saw\r\nthe earliest attempts made in a systematic way toward the spread of\r\neducation among the multitudes, his message to the Legislature of 1795\r\nurging a generous appropriation to common schools. This was the first\r\nsuggestion of state aid. Colleges and seminaries had been remembered,\r\nbut schools for the common people waited until Clinton had been\r\ngovernor for eighteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCLINTON AND THE PRESIDENCY\r\n\r\n1812\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years DeWitt Clinton had had aspirations to become a\r\ncandidate for President. He entered the United States Senate in 1802\r\nwith such an ambition; he became mayor of New York in 1803 with this\r\nend in view; he sought the lieutenant-governorship in 1811 for no\r\nother purpose; and, although he had never taken a managing step in\r\nthat direction, looking cautiously into the future, he saw his way and\r\nonly waited for the passing of the Vice President. DeWitt Clinton,\r\nwhatever his defects of character and however lacking he may have been\r\nin an exalted sense of political principle, appears to have been\r\nsincere in his anxiety to elevate his uncle to the presidential chair.\r\nDuring Jefferson's administration his efforts seem never to have been\r\nintermitted, and only when the infirmities of advanced age admonished\r\nhim that George Clinton's life and career were nearly at an end, did\r\nhis mind and heart, acquiescing in the appropriation of his relative's\r\nmantle, seize the first opportunity of satisfying his unbounded\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nThe opening presented in the spring of 1812 was not an unattractive\r\none. A new party, controlled by a remarkable coterie of brilliant\r\nyoung men from the South, whose shibboleth was war with England, had\r\nsprung up in Congress, and, by sheer force of will and intellect, had\r\ndragged to the support of its policies the larger part of the\r\nRepublican majority.[164] President Madison was thoroughly in\r\nsympathy with these members. He thought war should be declared before\r\nCongress adjourned, and, to hasten its coming, he had recommended an\r\nembargo for sixty days. \"For my own part,\" he wrote Jefferson, \"I look\r\nupon a short embargo as a step to immediate war, and I wait only for\r\nthe Senate to make the declaration.\"[165] This did not sound like a\r\npeace voice; yet the anti-English party felt little cordiality for\r\nhim. His abilities, as the event amply proved, were not those likely\r\nto wage a successful war. He was regarded as a timid man, incapable of\r\na burst of passion or a bold act. In place of resolute opinion he\r\ncourted argument; with an inclination to be peevish and fretful, he\r\nwas at times arrogantly pertinacious. Although his health, moreover,\r\nwas delicate and he looked worn and feeble, he exhibited no\r\nconsciousness of needing support, declining to reconstruct his Cabinet\r\nthat abler men might lend the assistance his own lack of energy\r\ndemanded. As time went on Republicans would gladly have exchanged him\r\nfor a stronger leader, one better fitted by character and temperament\r\nto select the men and find a way for a speedy victory. It was no less\r\nplain that the conservatives thoroughly disliked him, and if they\r\ncould have wrought a change without disrupting the party, it would\r\nhave suited their spirit and temper to have openly opposed his\r\nrenomination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: Of ninety-eight senators and representatives who voted,\r\non June 18, 1812, for a declaration of war against England,\r\nseventy-six, or four less than a majority, resided south of the\r\nDelaware. No Northern State except Pennsylvania declared for war,\r\nwhile every Southern State except Kentucky voted solidly for it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: Madison to Jefferson, April 24, 1812, _Writings_, Vol.\r\n2, p. 532.]\r\n\r\nDeWitt Clinton understood the situation, and his friends pointed with\r\nconfidence to his well known character for firmness and nerve. Of\r\nClinton, it may be justly said, that he seems most attractive, not as\r\na politician, not as a mayor solicitous for the good government of a\r\ngrowing city, not as a successful promoter of the canal, but as a\r\nrugged, inflexible, determined, self-willed personality. Perhaps not\r\nmany loved him, or longed for his companionship, or had any feeling of\r\ntenderness for him; yet, in spite of his manners or want of manners,\r\nthere was a fascination about the man that often disarmed censure and\r\nturned the critic into a devotee. At this time he undoubtedly stood at\r\nthe head of his party in the North. He was still young, having just\r\nentered his forties, still ambitious to shine as a statesman of the\r\nfirst magnitude. An extraordinary power of application had equipped\r\nhim with the varied information that would make him an authority in\r\nthe national life. Even his enemies admitted his capacity as a great\r\nexecutive. He had sometimes been compelled, for the sake of his own\r\ncareer, to regulate his course by a disregard of party creed,\r\nespecially at a time when the principles of Republicanism were\r\nsomewhat undefined in their character; but amid all the doubts and\r\ndistractions of a checkered, eventful political career he was known\r\nfor his absolute integrity, his clear head, and his steady nerve. His\r\nvery pride made it impossible for him to condescend to any violation\r\nof a promise.\r\n\r\nClinton's New York party friends naturally desired a legislative\r\nindorsement for him before Congress could act. But Governor Tompkins'\r\nsudden adjournment of the Legislature had stripped him of that\r\nadvantage, and three days before the houses reassembled, on May 18,\r\nMadison was renominated by a congressional caucus, seventeen senators\r\nand sixty-six representatives, including three from New York, taking\r\npart in its proceedings. Eleven days later, ninety out of ninety-five\r\nRepublican members of the New York Legislature voted in caucus to\r\nsupport Clinton.[166] If the Madison caucus doubted the wisdom of its\r\naction, the Clinton caucus was no less uncertain of the expediency of\r\nits decision. Governor Tompkins opposed it; the Livingstons assailed\r\nit; the Martling Men, led by Sanford and Lewis, refused to attend;\r\nAmbrose Spencer and John Taylor went into it because they were\r\ndriven; and Erastus Root, in maintaining that Clinton could not, and\r\nas a Federal candidate ought not, to succeed, clearly voiced the\r\nsentiment of a large minority. In short, the most prominent men in the\r\nState opposed the nomination, knowing that Republicans outside of New\r\nYork could not support it because of its irregularity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: \"This unusual unanimity among the New York Republicans\r\npointed to a growing jealousy of Virginia, which threatened to end in\r\nrevival of the old alliance between New York and New England.\"--Henry\r\nAdams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 6, p. 215. \"George\r\nClinton, who had yielded unwillingly to Jefferson, held Madison in\r\ncontempt.\"--_Ibid._, Vol. 4, p. 227.]\r\n\r\nBut, at the supreme moment, events greatly favoured Clinton. Pierre\r\nVan Cortlandt, Obadiah German, and other members of Congress appeared\r\nupon the scene, bringing the story of Madison's unpopularity and\r\nbearing letters from Gideon Granger, the postmaster-general, urging\r\nthe support of Clinton. Granger belonged to Connecticut, and, except\r\nWilliam Eustis, about to retire as an inefficient secretary of war,\r\nwas the only cabinet officer from a northern State. He knew that not a\r\ndozen northern members of Congress sincerely favoured war, and that\r\nnot a man in the party save Madison himself, sincerely favoured the\r\nPresident's renomination; but he also knew that the South had\r\ndetermined to force the issue; and so in a powerful document he\r\ndemanded the nomination of a man who, when conflict came, could\r\nshorten it by a vigorous administration. This appeal lifted the\r\nClinton movement above the level of an ordinary state nomination.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his selection, DeWitt Clinton believed his chances more\r\nthan even. Though the declaration of war had popularised Madison in\r\nthe South and West, and, in a measure, solidified the Republicans in\r\nthe North, the young aspirant still counted on a majority of\r\nmalcontents and Federalists. The best obtainable information indicated\r\nthat three Republicans in Massachusetts would unite with the\r\nFederalists in choosing Clinton electors; that the rest of New England\r\nwould act with Massachusetts; and that Clinton would also obtain\r\nsupport in Maryland, Ohio, North Carolina, Delaware, New Jersey, and,\r\npossibly, Virginia. \"If Pennsylvania should be combined,\" Clinton said\r\nto Gouverneur Morris, \"I would come out all right.\" As late, too, as\r\nthe middle of September, Rufus King ventured the opinion to\r\nChristopher Gore that while North Carolina was still uncertain,\r\nDelaware, New Jersey and Maryland would probably become Clintonian,\r\nalthough Pennsylvania and Vermont would be \"democratic and\r\nMadisonian.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Federalist leaders, Clinton called himself an American\r\nFederalist. If chosen President he engaged to make immediate peace\r\nwith England, and to oppose the views of those Southern States which\r\nsought to degrade the Northern States by oppressing commerce.[167] It\r\nwas this suggestion that led to a secret conference between Clinton,\r\nJohn Jay, Rufus King and Gouverneur Morris, held at the latter's home\r\non August 5, to consider the advisability of forming a peace party.\r\nFew scenes in political history are more dramatic than this meeting of\r\nClinton and the three Federalist leaders of the Empire State. King at\r\nfirst objected to taking any part. He looked on Clinton, he said, as\r\none who could lead only so long as he held the views and prejudices of\r\nhis followers, and who, unless a large body of Republicans came with\r\nhim, was not worth accepting. But King finally consented to be\r\npresent, after Jay, although in ill health, promised to join them.\r\nMorris was pleased to undertake his part, for association with Clinton\r\nupon the Canal Commission had made them somewhat intimate. It was\r\nagreed to exclude every topic except the plan of forming a peace\r\nparty. The hour fixed was two in the afternoon; but it was five\r\no'clock before Clinton entered the stately library at Morrisania.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: \"No canvass for the Presidency was ever less creditable\r\nthan that of DeWitt Clinton in 1812. Seeking war votes for the reason\r\nthat he favoured more vigorous prosecution of the war; asking support\r\nfrom peace Republicans because Madison had plunged the country into\r\nwar without preparation; bargaining for Federalist votes as the price\r\nof bringing about a peace; or coquetting with all parties in the\r\natmosphere of bribery in bank charters--Clinton strove to make up a\r\nmajority which had no element of union but himself and money.\"--Henry\r\nAdams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 6, p. 410.]\r\n\r\nIn opening the interview, Morris simply read the resolutions prepared\r\nfor a peace meeting. \"Then Clinton observed,\" says Rufus King, \"that\r\nhe did not differ from us in opinions respecting public affairs, and\r\nthat he entirely approved the resolutions; but, as his friends,\r\ncomprehending a great majority of the Republican party in the State,\r\nwere divided in their opinions respecting the war--prejudices against\r\nEngland leading some of them to approve the war--time was necessary to\r\nbring them to one opinion. Disastrous events had already happened, and\r\nowing to the incapacity of the national administration still further\r\nmisfortunes would occur, and would serve to produce an union of\r\nopinion respecting the war; that for these reasons the proposed peace\r\nmeeting should be deferred four or five weeks; in the interim he would\r\nconfer with his friends for the purpose of bringing about a common\r\nopinion, and apprise the movers of his ulterior views on Monday,\r\nAugust 10, when the canal commissioners would hold a meeting.\"[168]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: Rufus King, _Life and Correspondence_, Vol. 5, p. 269.]\r\n\r\nDuring the now historic interview, Clinton said that the President's\r\nincapacity made it impossible for him longer to continue his party\r\nrelation; and he pledged his honour that the breach between them was\r\nirreparable. Yet, on account of his friends as well as his own\r\naccount, he said, he deemed it expedient to avoid publicity on the\r\nsubject. He spoke of Spencer with bitterness, styling him \"his\r\ncreature,\" whom Armstrong governed, and who, in turn, influenced\r\nTompkins and John Taylor. \"Armstrong,\" he repeated, \"while engaged in\r\nmeasures to procure a peace meeting in Dutchess County over which he\r\nhad promised to preside, had been bought off by the miserable\r\ncommission of a brigadier-general.\"[169]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: _Ibid._, Vol. 5, p. 271.]\r\n\r\nAs the campaign grew older, the Federalists were perplexed and\r\ndistracted by an increasing uncertainty as to what they should do.\r\nThis was especially true of those who sighed for power and despaired\r\nof getting it through the continuance of a Federalist party. Rufus\r\nKing, clear as to the course which ought to be followed, earnestly\r\nadvised his friends to nominate a respectable Federalist, not with the\r\nexpectation of succeeding in the election, but for the purpose of\r\nkeeping the Federal body unbroken in principle; that its character and\r\ninfluence might be reserved for the occasion which, in the present\r\ncourse of affairs, he said, could not fail to arrive. King, however,\r\nfailed to influence his friends. On September 15, in a convention of\r\nsixty or more delegates from all the States north of the Potomac, it\r\nwas recommended that, as it would be inexpedient to name a Federal\r\ncandidate because impractical to elect one, Federalists should\r\nco-operate in the election of a President who would be likely to\r\npursue a different policy from Madison.\r\n\r\nThis resolution was largely due to the eloquence of Harrison Gray\r\nOtis. He urged that the defeat of Madison would speedily lead to a\r\npeace, for which the door stood open in the repeal of the Orders in\r\nCouncil. Rufus King insisted that the name all had in mind be given in\r\nthe resolution; although, he admitted, no one knew whether Clinton\r\nwould pursue a policy different from Madison's. No man in the country,\r\nhe said, was more equivocal in his character. He had disapproved the\r\nembargo and then receded from his opinion; and, to restore himself to\r\nthe confidence of his party, he had published a tirade against the\r\nFederalists. \"If we succeed in promoting his election,\" thundered the\r\norator, \"I fear we may place in the chair a Cæsar Borgia instead of a\r\nJames Madison.\"[170] These were bitter words, recalling Hamilton's\r\nfamous criticism of Aaron Burr, but they were spoken without the\r\nwealth of Hamilton's experience to support them. That Clinton would\r\nsacrifice his own interests and his own ambition for the sake of any\r\npolitical cause no one could believe; that he had played fast and\r\nloose for a time with the great question of embargo was too well known\r\nto be denied; but that anything had occurred in his public career to\r\njustify Rufus King's simile, his worst enemies could not seriously\r\ncredit. Even Christopher Gore was compelled to admit that the Federal\r\nleaders of Massachusetts \"are favourably impressed with the character\r\nand views of Clinton. Indeed, since last spring I have scarcely heard\r\nany one speak of him but extolled the excellence of his moral\r\ncharacter and the purity of his present political views.\"[171] To this\r\nKing simply replied: \"I stated my sentiments to the meeting, a great\r\nmajority of whom thought them incorrect. Time, which reveals truth,\r\nmust decide between us.\"[172]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: Rufus King, _Life and Correspondence_, Vol. 5, p. 281.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: Rufus King, _Life and Correspondence_, Vol. 5, pp.\r\n281-4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: _Ibid._, Vol. 5, p. 283.]\r\n\r\nBy the middle of September, Clinton exhibited lamentable weakness as a\r\npolitical organiser. Opposing him, he had the whole power of state and\r\nnational administrations, and the most prominent men of the party, led\r\nby Erastus Root. Besides, a new Legislature, elected in the preceding\r\nApril, had a Republican majority on joint ballot divided between\r\nClintonians and Madisonians; and, still further to perplex the\r\nsituation, twenty Republican assemblymen absolutely refused to vote\r\nunless Madison were given a fair division of the electors. This meant\r\nthe surrender of one elector out of three, an arrangement to which\r\nClinton dared not consent.\r\n\r\nClinton, though seriously impressed by the gravity of his position,\r\nseems to have done nothing to clear the way; but the hour of crisis\r\nbrought with it the man demanded. During recent years a new and very\r\nremarkable figure in political life had been coming to the front.\r\nMartin Van Buren, afterward President of the United States, was\r\nestablishing his claim to the position of commanding influence he was\r\ndestined to hold during the next three decades. His father, an\r\ninnkeeper in the village of Kinderhook, gave him a chance to learn a\r\nlittle English at the common schools, and a little Latin at the\r\nacademy. At the age of fourteen, he began sweeping an office and\r\nrunning errands for a country attorney, who taught him the law. Then\r\nhe went to New York City to finish his education in the office of\r\nWilliam P. Van Ness, an old Columbia County neighbour, at that time\r\nmaking his brilliant and bitter attack as \"Aristides\" upon the\r\nClintons and the Livingstons. A year later, in 1803, Van Buren\r\ncelebrated his twenty-first birthday by forming a partnership in\r\nKinderhook with a half-brother, James J. Van Alen, already established\r\nin the practice. In 1808, he became surrogate; and when the\r\nLegislature convened in November, 1812, he took a seat in the Senate,\r\nthe youngest man save one, it is said, until then elected to that\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren had shown unusual sagacity as a politician. Born\r\nunder conditions which might have disheartened one of different mould,\r\nbred in a county given up to Federalism, and taught in the law for six\r\nyears by an uncompromising follower of Hamilton, he nevertheless held\r\nsteadfastly to the Jeffersonian faith of his father. Nor would he be\r\nmoved in his fealty to the Clintons, although Van Ness, his\r\ndistinguished law preceptor, worshipped Burr and hated his enemies. As\r\na very young man, Van Buren was able to see that the principles of\r\nRepublicanism had established themselves in the minds of the great\r\nmajority of the people interested in political life, and if he had\r\nbeen persuaded that Aaron Burr and his Federalist allies were to be\r\nrestored to power in 1804, he was far too shrewd to be tempted by the\r\nprospects of such a coalition. He had also shown, from his first\r\nentrance into politics, a remarkable capacity for organisation. He had\r\ncourage, a social and cheerful temper, engaging manners, and\r\nextraordinary application. He also had the happy faculty of guiding\r\nwithout seeming to dictate; he could show the way without pushing one\r\nalong the path. Finally, back of all, was the ability that soon made\r\nhim the peer of Elisha Williams, the ablest lawyer in a county famous\r\nfor its brilliant men, enabling him quickly to outgrow the\r\nprofessional limitations of Kinderhook, and to extend his practice far\r\nbeyond the limits of the busy city of Hudson.\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren cannot be ranked as a great orator. He spoke too\r\nrapidly, and he was wanting in imagination, without which eloquence of\r\nthe highest character is impossible. Besides, although his head was\r\nwell formed and his face singularly attractive, his small figure\r\nplaced him at a disadvantage. He possessed, however, a remarkable\r\ncommand of language, and his graceful, persuasive manner, often\r\nanimated, sometimes thrilling, frequently impassioned, inspired\r\nconfidence in his sincerity, and easily classed him among the ablest\r\nspeakers. His best qualities consisted in his clearness of exposition,\r\nhis masterly array of forcible argument, his faculty for balancing\r\nevidence, for acquiring and comparing facts, and for appreciating\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\nWhen Van Buren entered the State Senate he was recognised as the\r\nRepublican leader of his section. A recent biographer says that his\r\nskill in dealing with men was extraordinary, due no doubt to his\r\ntemper of amity and inborn genius for society. \"As you saw him once,\"\r\nwrote William Allen Butler, \"you saw him always--always punctilious,\r\nalways polite, always cheerful, always self-possessed. It seemed to\r\nany one who studied this phase of his character as if, in some early\r\nmoment of destiny, his whole nature had been bathed in a cool, clear,\r\nand unruffled depth, from which it drew this lifelong serenity and\r\nself-control.\"[173] Any intelligent observer of public life must have\r\nfelt that Martin Van Buren was only at the opening of a great\r\npolitical career. Inferior to DeWitt Clinton in the endowments which\r\nobtain for their possessor the title of a man of genius, he could,\r\nthough thirteen years younger, weigh the strength of conflicting\r\ntendencies in the political world with an accuracy to which Clinton\r\ncould not pretend.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: William Allen Butler, _Address on Martin Van Buren_\r\n(1862).]\r\n\r\nOn reaching Albany, in November, 1812, Van Buren saw the electoral\r\nsituation at a glance; and naturally, almost insensibly, he became\r\nClinton's representative. He slipped into leadership as easily as\r\nBonaparte stepped into the history of Europe, when he seized the fatal\r\nweakness in the well defended city of Toulon. Van Buren had approved\r\nembargo, non-intercourse, and the war itself. The discontent growing\r\nout of Jefferson's severe treatment of the difficulties caused by the\r\nOrders in Council and the Berlin and Milan Decrees, seems never to\r\nhave shaken his confidence in Republican statesmanship, or aroused\r\nthe slightest animosity against the congressional caucus nominee for\r\nPresident. But he accepted Clinton as the regular and practically the\r\nunanimous nominee of the Republican members of a preceding\r\nLegislature. Although Madison's nomination had come in the way then\r\naccepted, he had a stronger sense of allegiance to the expressed will\r\nof his party in the State. His adversaries, of whom he was soon to\r\nhave many, charged him with treachery to the President and to the\r\nparty. There came a time when it was asserted, and, apparently, with\r\nsome show of truth, that he had neither the courage nor the heart to\r\nkeep the side of his convictions boldly and finally; that he was\r\nalways thinking of personal interests, and trying to take the position\r\nwhich promised the greatest advantage and the greatest security. We\r\nshall have occasion, in the course of these pages, to study the basis\r\nof such criticism. But, in the present crisis, had he not been\r\nthoroughly sincere and single-hearted, he could easily have thrown in\r\nhis fortunes with the winning side; for at that time he must have had\r\nlittle faith in the chances of Clinton's election. Vermont had been\r\ngiven up, Pennsylvania was scarcely in doubt, and the South showed\r\nunmistakable signs of voting solidly for Madison.[174]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: \"DeWitt Clinton was classed by most persons as a\r\nreckless political gambler, but Martin Van Buren, when he intrigued,\r\npreferred to intrigue upon the strongest side. Yet one feeling was\r\nnatural to every New York politician, whether a Clinton or a\r\nLivingston, Burrite, Federalist, or Republican,--all equally disliked\r\nVirginia; and this innate jealousy gave to the career of Martin Van\r\nBuren for forty years a bias which perplexed his contemporaries, and\r\nstood in singular contradiction to the soft and supple nature he\r\nseemed in all else to show.\"--Henry Adams, _History of the United\r\nStates_, Vol. 6, pp. 409, 410.]\r\n\r\nVan Buren's work not only encouraged several Federalists to vote for\r\nClinton electors, but it compelled the Madisonians not to vote at all.\r\nIt seemed easy, when a master hand guided the helm, to bring order out\r\nof chaos. Upon joint ballot, the Clintonian electors received\r\nseventy-four votes to the Federalists' forty-five; twenty-eight blanks\r\nrepresented the Madison strength. Van Buren, however, could not\r\ncontrol in other States. If some one in Pennsylvania, of equal tact in\r\nthe management of men, could have supplemented his work, Clinton must\r\neasily have won. But it is not often given a party, or an individual,\r\nto have the assistance of two such men at the same time. After the\r\nvotes were counted, it appeared that Clinton had carried New\r\nHampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New\r\nJersey, Delaware, and had five votes in Maryland--eighty-nine in all.\r\nThe remaining one hundred and twenty-eight belonged to Madison.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the discontent excited by the declaration of war Clinton\r\nhad failed to foresee that there is something captivating to a\r\nspirited people about the opening of a new war. He had also failed to\r\nnotice that military failures could not affect Madison's strength. The\r\nsurrender of Detroit, Dearborn's blunder in wasting time, and the\r\ninefficiency of the secretary of war had raised a storm of public\r\nwrath sufficient to annihilate Hull and to shake the earth under\r\nEustis; but it passed harmlessly over the head of the President. The\r\nforeign policy of Jefferson and Madison, approved by the Republican\r\nparty, was on trial, and the defeat of the Administration meant a want\r\nof confidence in the party itself. Here, then, was a contingency\r\nagainst which Clinton had never thought of providing, and, as so often\r\nhappens, the one thing not taken into consideration, proved decisive\r\nin the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nQUARRELS AND RIVALRIES\r\n\r\n1813\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Clinton's loss of the Presidency, it must have been clear to his\r\nfriends and enemies alike that his influence in the Republican party\r\nwas waning. A revolution in sentiment did not then sweep over the\r\nState with anything like the swiftness and certainty of the present\r\nera of cheap newspapers and rapid transit. Yet, in spite of his\r\ngenius, which concealed, and, for a time, checked the suddenness of\r\nhis fall, the rank and file of the party quickly understood what had\r\nhappened. Friends began falling away. For several months Ambrose\r\nSpencer had openly and bitterly denounced him, and Governor Tompkins\r\ntook a decisive part in relieving his rival of the last hope of ever\r\nagain reckoning on the support of Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe feeling against Clinton was intensified by the common belief that\r\nthe election of Rufus King, as United States senator to succeed John\r\nSmith, on March 4, 1813, paid the Federalists their price for choosing\r\nClinton electors. The Republicans had a majority on joint ballot, and\r\nJames W. Wilkin, a senator from the middle district, was placed in\r\nnomination; but when the votes were counted King had sixty-four and\r\nWilkin sixty-one. It looked treacherous, and it suggested gross\r\ningratitude, since Wilkin had presided at the legislative caucus which\r\nnominated Clinton for President; but, as we have seen, events had been\r\nmoving in different ways, events destined to produce a strange crop of\r\npolitical results. In buying its charter, the Bank of America had\r\ncontracted to do many things, and the election of a United States\r\nsenator was not unlikely among its bargains. This theory seems the\r\nmore probable since Clinton, whom Rufus King had denounced as a\r\ndangerous demagogue, would have preferred putting King into a position\r\nof embarrassment more than into the United States Senate. Wilkin\r\nhimself so understood it, or, at least, he believed that the Bank, and\r\nnot Clinton, had contributed to his defeat, and he said so in a letter\r\nafterward found among the Clinton papers.\r\n\r\nHostile Republicans were, however, now ready to believe Clinton guilty\r\nof any act of turpitude or ingratitude; and so, on February 4, when a\r\nlegislative caucus renominated Daniel D. Tompkins for governor by\r\nacclamation, Clinton received only sixteen votes for lieutenant-governor.\r\nThere is no evidence that Van Buren took part in Clinton's\r\nhumiliation; but it is certain he did not act with all the fairness\r\nthat might have been expected. He could well have said that Clinton\r\nwas no worse than the majority of his party who had nominated him;\r\nthat his aim, like theirs, was a vigorous prosecution of the war in\r\nthe interest of an early peace; that he had no intention of separating\r\nhimself from the Republican party, and that his renomination for\r\nlieutenant-governor would reunite the party, making it more potent to\r\ncreate and support war measures. But Van Buren himself was not beyond\r\ndanger. Tammany's mutterings and Spencer's violent denunciations\r\nthreatened to exclude others from the party, and to escape their\r\nhostility, this rising young statesman found it convenient to drop\r\nClinton and shout for Tompkins. A less able and clear-headed man might\r\nhave gone wrong at this parting of the ways, just as did Obadiah\r\nGerman and other friends of Clinton; but Van Buren never needed a\r\nguide-post to point out to him the safest political road to travel.\r\nThe better to prove his party loyalty, he consented to draft the usual\r\ngrandiloquent address issued by the legislative caucus to Republican\r\nelectors, always a sophomoric appeal, but quite in accord with the\r\nrhetoric of the time. If any doubt existed as to the orthodoxy of Van\r\nBuren's Republicanism, this address must have dissipated it. It\r\nsustained the general government by forcible argument, and it appealed\r\nwith fervid eloquence and deep pathos to the patriotism of the people\r\nto continue their support of the party.\r\n\r\nHow great a part Clinton was yet to play in the history of his State\r\nno one could foresee. Much speculation has been indulged by writers as\r\nto the probable course of history had he been elected President, but\r\nthe mere fact that he was able to inspire so small a fraction of his\r\nparty with full faith in his leadership is decisive evidence that he\r\nwas not then the man of the hour. It is certain that his enemies\r\nbelieved his political life had been brought to an ignoble close.\r\nClinton probably felt that he would have no difficulty in living down\r\nthe opprobrium put upon him by partisan hostility; and to prove that\r\nhe was still in the political arena, a little coterie of distinguished\r\nfriends, led by Obadiah German and Pierre Van Cortlandt, made a circle\r\nabout him. From this vantage ground he defied his enemies, attacking\r\nMadison's conduct of the war with great severity, and protesting\r\nagainst the support of Tompkins and Taylor as the mere tools of\r\nMadison.\r\n\r\nClinton's usual good fortune also attended him. As we have seen, the\r\nApril elections in 1812 returned a Federalist Assembly, which selected\r\na Council of Appointment opposed to Clinton's removal from the\r\nmayoralty. It displaced everybody else throughout the State.\r\nClintonians and Madisonians alike suffered, including the able and\r\ndistinguished Thomas Addis Emmet, an ardent friend of Clinton who had\r\nbeen urged to accept the attorney-generalship after the death of\r\nMatthias B. Hildreth in the preceding August. But Clinton had the\r\nsupport of Jonas Platt, the leading member of the Council, and Platt\r\nrefused to permit his removal. Doubtless the latter hoped to fill up\r\nthe Federalist ranks with Clintonian recruits; and so with greater\r\nconfidence than usual the Federalists, when their turn came, nominated\r\nStephen Van Rensselaer for governor and George Huntington of Oneida\r\nCounty for lieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\nAside from the result of the elections of the preceding November,\r\nwhich had given Federalists twenty out of thirty congressmen, it is\r\ndifficult to understand upon what the party of Hamilton really based\r\nits confidence. Before the campaign was a month old, it must have been\r\nevident that the defeated candidate for President had as little\r\ninfluence as Van Rensselaer, who, as a major-general of militia in\r\ncommand at Fort Niagara, was a miserable failure. After shivering with\r\nfear for sixty days lest Hull's fate overtake him, Van Rensselaer,\r\napparently in sheer desperation, had suddenly ordered a small part of\r\nhis force across the river to be shot and captured in the presence of\r\na large reserve who refused to go to the assistance of their comrades.\r\nThe news of this defeat led Monroe to speak of him as \"a weak and\r\nincompetent man with high pretensions.\" Jefferson thought Hull ought\r\nto be \"shot for cowardice\" and Van Rensselaer \"broke for\r\nincapacity.\"[175]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: Jefferson to Madison, Nov. 5, 1812; _Jefferson MSS.\r\nSeries V._, Vol. XV.]\r\n\r\nBut the Federalists, unmindful of the real seriousness of that\r\ndisaster, contested the election with unusual vehemence, until the\r\nbest informed men of both parties conceded their advantage. The\r\nGovernment's incapacity was abundantly illustrated in the failure of\r\nits armies and in the impoverished condition of its treasury, and if\r\nthe home conditions had been disturbed by distress, the confidence of\r\nthe Federalists must have been realised. The people of the State,\r\nhowever, had seen and felt nothing of actual warfare. In spite of\r\nembargoes and blockades, ample supplies of foreign goods had continued\r\nto arrive; and, except along the Niagara frontier, occupied by a few\r\nhundred scattered settlers, the farms produced their usual harvests\r\nand the industries of life were not impaired. Under these conditions,\r\nthe voters of the country districts saw no reason for defeating a\r\ngovernor whom they liked, for a man whose military service added\r\nnothing to his credit or to the lustre of the State. So, when the\r\nelection storm subsided, it was found, to the bitter mortification of\r\nthe Federalists, that while the chief towns, New York, Hudson and\r\nAlbany, were strong in opposition, Tompkins and Taylor had triumphed\r\nby the moderate majority of 3606 in a total vote of over 83,000.[176]\r\nThe Senate stood three to one in favour of the Republicans. The\r\nAssembly was lost by ten votes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: Daniel D. Tompkins, 43,324; Stephen Van Rensselaer,\r\n39,718.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nTompkins was now at the zenith of his political career. He was one of\r\nthose men not infrequently observed in public life, who, without\r\nconspicuous ability, have a certain knack for the management of men,\r\nand are able to acquire influence and even a certain degree of fame by\r\npersonal skill in manipulating patronage, smoothing away difficulties,\r\nand making things easy. Nature had not only endowed him with a genius\r\nfor political diplomacy, but good fortune had favoured his march to\r\npopularity by disassociating him with any circumstances of birth or\r\nenvironment calculated to excite jealousy or to arouse the suspicion\r\nof the people. He was neither rich nor highly connected. The people\r\nknew him by the favourite title of the \"farmer's boy,\" and he never\r\nappeared to forget his humble beginnings. \"He had the faculty,\" says\r\nJames Renwick, formerly of Columbia College, who knew him personally,\r\n\"of never forgetting the name or face of any person with whom he had\r\nonce conversed; of becoming acquainted and appearing to take an\r\ninterest in the concerns of their families; and of securing, by his\r\naffability and amiable address, the good opinion of the female sex,\r\nwho, although possessed of no vote, often exercise a powerful indirect\r\ninfluence.\" Thus, while still in the early prime of life, he had risen\r\nto a position in the State which, even in the case of men with\r\nsuperior intellectual endowments, is commonly the reward of maturer\r\nyears and longer experience.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment Tompkins became governor in 1807 the strongest\r\nambition of his mind was success in the great game of politics; and,\r\nalthough never a good hater, his capacity for friendship depended\r\nupon whether the success of his own career was endangered by the\r\nassociation. Having laid Clinton in the dust, his eye rested upon John\r\nArmstrong, who had recently won the appointment of secretary of war.\r\nArmstrong had been recalled from Paris at the request of Napoleon,\r\njust in time to get in the way of both Clinton and Tompkins. At first\r\nhe was a malcontent, grumbling at Madison, and condemning the conduct\r\nof public affairs generally; but, after the declaration of war, he\r\nsupported the Administration, and, on July 6, 1812, to the surprise\r\nand indignation of Clinton, he accepted a brigadiership, with command\r\nof New York City and its defences. Then came the period of danger and\r\nurgency following the surrender of Detroit, and Armstrong, on the 6th\r\nof February, 1813, to the great embarrassment of Tompkins, obtained\r\nquick promotion to the head of the war department.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been no reason why Tompkins should have harboured\r\nthe feeling of rivalry toward Armstrong that he cherished for Clinton.\r\nThe former was simply a pretentious occupier of high places, without\r\nreal ability for great accomplishment. His little knowledge of the\r\ntheory and practice of war was learned on the staff of General Gates,\r\nwho, Bancroft says, \"had no fitness for command and wanted personal\r\ncourage.\" It was while Armstrong was dwelling in the tent of this\r\npolitical, intriguing adventurer, that he wrote the celebrated\r\n\"Newburgh Letters,\" stigmatised by Washington. These events, coupled\r\nwith his want of scruples and known capacity for intrigue and\r\nindolence, made him an object of such distrust that the Senate, in\r\nspite of his social and political connections, barely confirmed him.\r\n\r\nCould Tompkins, looking two years into the future, have foreseen\r\nArmstrong passing into disgraceful retirement after the capture of the\r\ncity of Washington, he might easily have dismissed all rivalry from\r\nhis mind; but just now the two men who seemed to stand most in his way\r\nwere Armstrong and Spencer. He thought Spencer in too close and\r\nfriendly alliance with Armstrong, and that Armstrong, whose strength\r\nin the State greatly depended upon Spencer's influence, was the only\r\nobstacle in his path to the White House. Thus there arose in his mind\r\na sentiment of rivalry for Armstrong, and a strong feeling of distrust\r\nand dislike for Spencer. The latter, who now possessed little more\r\nreal liking for Tompkins than Clinton did, soon understood the\r\nGovernor's feeling toward him; and he also learned that Van Buren,\r\nwith an intellect for organisation and control far superior to\r\nanything the Republicans of the State had heretofore known, had come\r\ninto the political game to stay.\r\n\r\nBy phenomenal luck, DeWitt Clinton's good fortune still continued to\r\nattend him. In April, 1813, the Federalists had again carried the\r\nAssembly, and, although without senators in the middle and western\r\ndistricts to serve upon the Council of Appointment, Clinton found a\r\nfriend in Henry A. Townsend, who answered the purpose of a Federalist.\r\nTownsend would support Jonas Platt for a judgeship if Clinton was\r\nretained as mayor.\r\n\r\nTownsend had come into the Senate in 1810 as a Clinton Republican, but\r\nhis brief legislative career had not been as serene as a summer's day.\r\nHe fell out with Tompkins and Spencer when he fell in with Thomas and\r\nSouthwick, and whether or not the favours distributed by the Bank of\r\nAmerica actually became a part of his assets, the bank's opponents\r\ntook such violent exception to his vote that poor Townsend had little\r\nto hope for from that faction of his party. It was commonly believed\r\nat the time, therefore, that a desire to please Clinton and possibly\r\nto gain the favour of Federalists in the event of their future\r\nsuccess, influenced him to support Platt, conditional on the retention\r\nof Clinton. It is quite within the range of probability that some such\r\nmotive quickened his instinct for revenge and self-preservation,\r\nalthough it led to an incident that must have caused Clinton keen\r\nregret and mental anguish.\r\n\r\nTownsend's Republican colleague in the Council was none other than\r\nMorgan Lewis, who saw an opportunity of creating trouble by nominating\r\nRichard Riker as an opposing candidate to Platt. Tompkins had\r\nprobably something to do with making this nomination--or, at all\r\nevents, with giving his friend Lewis the idea of bringing it forward\r\njust then. Surely, they thought, Clinton would reverence Riker, who\r\nacted as second in the Swartout duel and recently headed the committee\r\nto promote his election to the Presidency. Clinton felt the sting of\r\nhis enemies. There was a time when Clinton had supported Tompkins\r\nagainst Lewis; now Lewis, in supporting Tompkins against Clinton, was\r\nthrusting the latter through with a two-edged knife; for if Townsend\r\nvoted for Riker, the Federalists would drop Clinton; if he voted for\r\nPlatt, Riker would drop him. In vain did Clinton wait for Riker to\r\nsuggest some avenue of escape. The plucky second wanted a judgeship\r\nwhich meant years of good living, as much as Clinton wanted the\r\nmayoralty that might be lost in another year. Clinton had not yet\r\ndrunk the dregs of the bitter cup. False friends and their unpaid\r\nsecurity debts were still to bankrupt him; but he had already seen\r\nenough to know that the setting sun is not worshipped. Under these\r\ncircumstances his friendship for Riker was not strong enough to induce\r\nhim to throw away his last chance of holding the mayoralty and its fat\r\nfees; and so when Townsend voted for Platt, Riker's affection for\r\nClinton turned to hate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA GREAT WAR GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n1812-1815\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assumption of extraordinary responsibilities during the War of\r\n1812, justly conferred upon Daniel D. Tompkins the title of a great\r\nwar governor. There is an essential difference between a war governor\r\nand a governor in time of war. One is enthusiastic, resourceful, with\r\nability to organise victory by filling languishing patriotism with new\r\nand noble inspiration--the other simply performs his duty, sometimes\r\nrespectably, sometimes only perfunctorily. George Clinton illustrated,\r\nin his own person, the difference between a great war governor and a\r\ngovernor in time of war. If he failed to win renown on the\r\nbattlefield, his ability to inspire the people with confidence, and to\r\nbring glory out of threatened failure and success out of apparent\r\ndefeat, made him the greatest war governor the country had yet known.\r\nDaniel D. Tompkins served his State no less acceptably. In the moment\r\nof greatest discouragement he displayed a patriotic courage in\r\nborrowing money without authority of law that made his Administration\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nYet Tompkins' patriotism scarcely rose to that sublime height which\r\nsuffers its possessor unselfishly to advance a rival even for the\r\npublic welfare. There is no doubt of DeWitt Clinton's conspicuous\r\ndevotion to the interests of his country throughout the entire war. He\r\nexceeded his power as mayor in inducing the Common Council to borrow\r\nmoney on the credit of the city and loan it to the United States; at\r\nthe supreme moment of a great crisis, when the national treasury was\r\nempty and a British fleet threatened destruction to the coast, an\r\nimpressive address which he drafted, accompanied by a subscription\r\npaper which he headed, resulted in raising a fund of over one million\r\ndollars for the city's defence. The genius of Clinton had never been\r\nmore nobly employed than in his efforts to sustain the war, winning\r\nhim universal esteem throughout the municipality for his patriotic\r\nunselfishness and unlimited generosity. Tompkins must have known that\r\nsuch a man, already holding the rank of major-general in the militia,\r\nwould be absolute master of any situation. He was not the one to throw\r\nup the cards because the chances of the game were going against him.\r\nHis was a fighting spirit, and his impulse was ever, like that of\r\nMacbeth, to try to the last. But Tompkins could not fail to observe\r\nthe party's growing dislike for Clinton, and, much as he wanted\r\nmilitary success, he graciously declined Clinton's request, brought to\r\nhim by Thomas Addis Emmet, to be assigned to active service in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nTompkins had little to encourage him at the outset of the war. The\r\nelection in April, 1812, had turned the Assembly over to the\r\nFederalists, who not only wasted the time of an extra session, called\r\nin November of that year, but carried their opposition through the\r\nregular session begun in January, 1813. The emergency was pressing.\r\nNew England Federalists had declined to make the desired loans to the\r\ngeneral government, and the governor of New York wished his State to\r\nrelieve the situation by advancing the needed money. It was a\r\npatriotic measure. Whether right or wrong, the declaration of war had\r\njeopardised the country. Soldiers, poorly equipped, scantily clothed,\r\nwithout organisation, and without pay, were scattered for hundreds of\r\nmiles along a sparsely settled border, opened to the attacks of a\r\npowerful enemy; yet the Federalists refused to vote a dollar to equip\r\na man. Why should we continue a war from the prosecution of which we\r\nhave nothing to gain, they asked? The Orders in Council have been\r\nrepealed, England has shrunk from facing the consequences of its own\r\nfolly, and America has already won a complete triumph. What further\r\nneed, then, for bleeding our exhausted treasury?\r\n\r\nThe Governor's embarrassment, however, did not emanate from the\r\nFederalists alone. The northern frontier of New York was to become the\r\ngreat battle-ground, and it was conceded that capable generals and a\r\nsufficient force were necessary to carry the war promptly into Canada.\r\nBut the President furnished neither. He appointed Henry Dearborn, with\r\nthe rank of major-general, to command the district from Niagara to the\r\nSt. Lawrence, thus putting all military operations within the State\r\nunder the control of a man in his sixty-second year, whose only\r\nmilitary experience had been gained as a deputy quartermaster-general\r\nin 1781, and as colonel of a New Hampshire regiment after the end of\r\nthe Revolutionary War. Dearborn was a politician--not a general. After\r\nserving several years in Jefferson's Cabinet, he graduated into the\r\ncustom-house at Boston, where he concerned himself more to beat the\r\nFederalists than he ever exerted himself to defeat the British. In his\r\nopinion, campaigning ought to have its regular alternations of\r\nactivity and repose, but he never knew when activity should begin. To\r\nmake the condition more supremely ironic, Morgan Lewis, now in his\r\nfifty-ninth year, whose knowledge of war, like Dearborn's, had been\r\nlearned as a deputy quartermaster-general thirty years before, was\r\nassociated with him in command.\r\n\r\nDearborn submitted a plan of campaign, recommending that the main army\r\nadvance by way of Lake Champlain upon Montreal, while three corps of\r\nmilitia should enter Canada from Detroit, Niagara and Sackett's\r\nHarbour. This was as near as Dearborn ever came to a successful\r\ninvasion of Canada. War was declared on June 18, 1812, and July had\r\nbeen frittered away before he left Albany. Meantime General Hull,\r\nwhose success depended largely upon Dearborn's vigorous support from\r\nNiagara, having been a fortnight on British soil, now recrossed the\r\nriver and a few days later surrendered his army and Detroit to General\r\nBrock. This tragic event aroused Dearborn sufficiently to send Stephen\r\nVan Rensselaer to command the Niagara frontier, the feeble General\r\nassuring the secretary of war that, as soon as the force at Lewiston\r\naggregated six thousand men, a forward movement should be made; but\r\nDearborn himself, with the largest force then under arms, took good\r\ncare to remain on Lake Champlain, clinging to its shores like a\r\nbarnacle, as if afraid of the fate visited upon the unfortunate Hull.\r\nFinally, after two months of waiting, Van Rensselaer sent a thousand\r\nmen across the Niagara to Queenstown to be killed and captured within\r\nsight of four thousand troops who refused to go to the help of their\r\ncomrades. Disgusted and defeated, Van Rensselaer turned over his\r\ncommand to Brigadier-General Alexander Smith, a boastful Irish friend\r\nof Madison from Virginia, who issued burlesque proclamations about an\r\ninvasion of Canada, and then declined to risk an engagement, although\r\nhe had three Americans to one Englishman. This closed the campaign of\r\n1812.\r\n\r\nWith the hope of improving the military situation John Armstrong was\r\nmade secretary of war in place of William Eustis. Armstrong was never\r\na favourite. His association with Gates and his subsequent career in\r\nFrance, made him an object of distrust. But, once in office, he picked\r\nup the Eustis ravellings and announced a plan of campaign which\r\nincluded an attack on Montreal from Lake Champlain; the destruction of\r\nKingston and York (Toronto) by the troops from Sackett's Harbour; and\r\nthe expulsion of the British from the Niagara frontier. The Kingston\r\npart of the programme possessed genuine merit. Kingston commanded the\r\ntraffic of the St. Lawrence, between Upper and Lower Canada, and no\r\nBritish force could maintain itself in Upper Canada without ready\r\ncommunication with the lower province; but Dearborn decided to reverse\r\nArmstrong's plan by taking York, afterward the Niagara frontier, and\r\nthen unite a victorious army against Kingston. Dearborn, to do him\r\njustice, offered to resign, and Armstrong would gladly have gotten rid\r\nof him, with Morgan Lewis and other incompetents. The President,\r\nhowever, clung to the old men, making the spring and early summer\r\ncampaign of 1813, like its predecessor, a record of dismal failures.\r\nYork had, indeed, capitulated after the bloodiest battle of the war,\r\nthe American loss amounting to one-fifth the entire force, including\r\nPike, the best brigadier then in the service. But the British still\r\nheld Niagara; two brigade commanders had been sorely defeated; a third\r\nhad surrendered five hundred and forty men to a British lieutenant\r\nwith two hundred and sixty; and Sackett's Harbour, with its barracks\r\nburned and navy-yard destroyed, had barely escaped capture, while\r\nKingston was unmolested and Dearborn totally incapacitated \"with fever\r\nand mortification.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now midsummer. Tompkins and a Republican Senate had been\r\nre-elected, but the Federalists, whose policy was to obtain peace on\r\nany terms, still held the Assembly. Just at this time, therefore,\r\nsuccess in the field would have been of immense value politically, and\r\nas sickness had put Dearborn out of commission, it gave Armstrong an\r\nopportunity of promoting Winfield Scott and Jacob Brown, both of whom\r\nhad shown unusual ability in spite of the shameless incapacity of\r\ntheir seniors. The splendid fighting qualities of Jacob Brown had\r\nsaved Sackett's Harbour; and the brilliant pluck of Winfield Scott had\r\nwithstood a force three times his own until British bayonets pushed\r\nhim over the crest of Queenstown Heights. Armstrong, however, had a\r\nliking for James Wilkinson. They had been companions in arms with\r\nGates at Saratoga, and, although no one knew better than Armstrong the\r\nfeebleness of Wilkinson's character, he assigned him to New York after\r\nthe President had forced his removal from New Orleans.\r\n\r\nWilkinson's military life might fairly be described as infamous.\r\nWinfield Scott spoke of him as an \"unprincipled imbecile.\"[177] He had\r\nrecently been several times court-martialled, once for being engaged\r\nin a treasonable conspiracy with Spain, again as an accomplice of\r\nAaron Burr, and finally for corruption; and, although each time he had\r\nbeen acquitted, his brother officers regarded him with suspicion and\r\ncontempt. Nevertheless, this man, fifty-six years of age, and broken\r\nin health as well as character, was substituted for Dearborn and\r\nordered to take Kingston; and Wade Hampton, one year his senior,\r\nwithout a war record, and not on speaking terms with Wilkinson, was\r\nordered to Plattsburg to take Montreal. Folly such as this could only\r\nend in disaster. Whatever Armstrong suggested Wilkinson opposed, and\r\nwhatever Wilkinson advised Hampton resented; but Wilkinson so far\r\nprevailed, that, before either expedition started, it was agreed to\r\nabandon Kingston; and before either general had passed far beyond the\r\nlimits of the State, it was agreed to abandon Montreal, leaving the\r\ngenerals and the secretary of war ample time to quarrel over their\r\nresponsibility for the failure. Wilkinson charged Hampton with\r\nblasting the honour of the army, and both generals accused Armstrong\r\nof purposely deserting them to shift the blame from himself. On the\r\nother hand, Armstrong accepted Hampton's resignation, sneered at\r\nWilkinson for abandoning the campaign, and, after Hampton's death,\r\nsaddled him with the responsibility of the whole failure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: Winfield Scott, _Autobiography_, p. 94, _note_.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, while the generals and secretary quarrelled, and their\r\ntwelve thousand troops rested in winter quarters at French Mills and\r\nPlattsburg--leaving the country between Detroit and Sackett's Harbour\r\nwith less than a regiment--the British were vigorously at work. They\r\npounced upon the Niagara frontier; reoccupied Fort George; carried\r\nFort Niagara with great slaughter; and burned Black Rock and Buffalo\r\nin revenge for the destruction of Newark and Queenstown and the public\r\nbuildings at York. This ended the campaign of 1813.\r\n\r\nOn the high seas, however, the American navy, so small that England\r\nhad scarcely known of its existence, was redeeming the country from\r\nthe disgrace its generals had brought upon it. There are some battles\r\nof that time, fought out in storm and darkness, which taught Americans\r\nthe real pleasures of war, and turned the names of vessels and their\r\nbrave commanders into household words; but not until Oliver H. Perry,\r\nan energetic young officer, was ordered from Newport to the Niagara\r\nfrontier, in the spring of 1813, did conditions change from sacrifice\r\nand disgrace to real success. Six vessels were at that time building\r\nat Erie; and three smaller craft rested quietly in the navy-yard at\r\nBlack Rock. Perry's orders included the union of these fleets,\r\ncarrying fifty-four guns and five hundred men, and the destruction of\r\nsix British vessels, carrying sixty-three guns and four hundred and\r\nfifty men. Six months of patient labour on both sides were required to\r\nput the squadrons into fighting condition; but when, on the afternoon\r\nof September 10, Perry had fought the fight to a finish, the British\r\nsquadron belonged to him. The War of 1812 would be memorable for this,\r\nif it were for nothing else; and the indomitable Perry, whose stubborn\r\ncourage had wrested victory from what seemed inevitable defeat, is\r\nenthroned among the proudest names of the great sea fighters of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAfter Wilkinson, Morgan Lewis, and other incompetent generals had\r\nretired in disgrace, Armstrong recognised the genius of Jacob Brown\r\nand Winfield Scott. Brown was of Quaker parentage, a school teacher by\r\nprofession, and a farmer by occupation. After founding the town of\r\nBrownsville, he had owned and lived on a large tract of land near\r\nSackett's Harbour, and for recreation he had commanded a militia\r\nregiment. In 1811, Tompkins made him a brigadier, and when the contest\r\nopened, he found his true mission. He knew nothing of the technique of\r\nwar. Laying out fortifications, policing camps, arranging with\r\ncalculating foresight for the far future, did not fall within his\r\nknowledge; but for a fighter he must always rank in history with John\r\nPaul Jones; and as a leader of men he had hardly a rival in those\r\ndays. Soldiers only wanted his word of command to undertake any\r\nenterprise, no matter how hopeless. Winfield Scott, who understood\r\nBrown's limitations, said there was nothing he could not do if he only\r\ngot a fair opportunity. Armstrong commissioned him a major-general in\r\nplace of Wilkinson, and assigned Scott to a brigade in his command.\r\nThese officers, full of zeal and vigor, infused new life into an army\r\nthat had been beaten and battered for two years. In twelve weeks,\r\nduring July, August, and September, the British met stubborn\r\nresistance at Chippewa, Lundy's Lane, Fort Erie, and Black Rock, and a\r\nrepulse as disgraceful as it was complete at Plattsburg. But before\r\nBrown could establish the new order of things along the whole Canadian\r\nborder, the British took Oswego, with its abundant commissary\r\nsupplies, and their navy inflicted a wound, in the destruction of the\r\n_Chesapeake_ and the _Argus_, that turned the Perry huzzas into\r\nsuppressed lamentations.\r\n\r\nFollowing this calamity, occurred the April elections of 1814. The\r\nuncertain temper of the people gave Tompkins little to expect and much\r\nto fear. He believed it had only needed a bold and spirited forward\r\nmovement to demonstrate that the United States was in a position to\r\ndictate terms to England; but existing conditions indicated that\r\nEngland would soon dictate terms to the United States. Tompkins may be\r\nfairly excused, therefore, if he failed to discern in the struggle for\r\npolitical supremacy the slightest indication of that victory so long\r\nprayed for. Events, however, had been working silently--differently\r\nthan either Federalist or Republican guessed; and, to the utter\r\namazement of all, the war party swept the State, electing assemblymen\r\neven in New York City, twenty out of thirty congressmen, and every\r\nsenator, save one. Under these circumstances Tompkins lost no time in\r\nsummoning, in September, an extra session of the newly elected\r\nLegislature, which began turning out war measures like cloth from a\r\nloom. It raised the pay of the militia above that of the regular army;\r\nit encouraged privateering; it authorised the enlistment of twelve\r\nthousand men for two years and two thousand slaves for three years; it\r\nprovided for a corps of twenty companies for coast defence; it assumed\r\nthe State's quota of direct tax, and it reimbursed Governor Tompkins\r\nfor personal expenditures incurred without authority of law. Some of\r\nthese measures were drastic, especially the conscription bill; but the\r\nact showing the determination of the Republican party to fight the\r\nwar to a finish, was that allowing slaves to enlist with the consent\r\nof their masters, and awarding them freedom when honourably mustered\r\nout of service.\r\n\r\nThere was certainly much need for an active and vigorous Legislature\r\nin the fall of 1814. Washington had been captured and burned;\r\nArmstrong, threatened with removal, had resigned in disgrace; the\r\nnational treasury was empty; and every bank between New Orleans and\r\nAlbany had suspended specie payment, with their notes from twenty to\r\nthirty per cent. below par. Although, in ten weeks, from July 3 to\r\nSeptember 11, the British had met a bloody and unparalleled check from\r\nan inferior force, under the brilliant leadership of Brown and Scott,\r\nand a most disgraceful repulse by Macdonough and Macomb at Plattsburg,\r\nvictorious English veterans, fresh from the battlefields of Spain,\r\ncontinued to arrive, until Canada contained twenty-seven thousand\r\nregular troops. On the other hand, Macomb had only fifteen hundred men\r\nat Plattsburg, Brown less than two thousand at Fort Erie, and Izard\r\nabout four thousand at Buffalo.\r\n\r\nTo make bad matters worse, the New England Federalists were renewing\r\ntheir talk of a dissolution of the Union. \"We have been led by the\r\nterms of the Constitution,\" said Governor Strong of Massachusetts,\r\naddressing the Legislature on October 5, 1814, \"to rely on the\r\ngovernment of the Union to provide for our defence. We have resigned\r\nto that government the revenues of the State with the expectation that\r\nthis object would not be neglected. Let us, then, unite in such\r\nmeasures for our safety as the times demand and the principles of\r\njustice and the law of self-preservation will justify.\"[178] Answering\r\nfor the Legislature, which understood the Governor's words to be an\r\ninvitation to resume powers the State had given up when adopting the\r\nConstitution, Harrison Gray Otis reported that \"this people, being\r\nready and determined to defend themselves, have the greatest need of\r\nthose resources derivable from themselves which the national\r\ngovernment has hitherto thought proper to employ elsewhere. When this\r\ndeficiency becomes apparent, no reason can preclude the right of the\r\nwhole people who were parties to it, to adopt another.\"[179] The\r\nreport closed by recommending the appointment of delegates \"to meet\r\nand confer with delegates from the States of New England or any of\r\nthem,\" out of which grew the celebrated Hartford Convention that met\r\non the 15th of December. The report of this convention, made on the\r\n24th of the same month, declared that a severance of the Union can be\r\njustified only by absolute necessity; but, following the Virginia\r\nresolution of 1798, it confirmed the right of a State to \"interpose\r\nits authority\" for the protection of its citizens against\r\nconscriptions and drafts, and for an arrangement with the general\r\ngovernment to retain \"a reasonable portion\" of the revenues to be used\r\nin its own defence and in the defence of neighbouring States. In other\r\nwords, it favoured the establishment of a New England confederacy.\r\nThus, after ten years, the crisis had come which Pickering, the storm\r\npetrel, desired to precipitate in the days when Hamilton declined to\r\nlisten and Aaron Burr consented to lead.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: Message; _Niles_, Vol. 7, p. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: Report of Oct. 8, 1814; _Niles_, Vol. 7, p. 149.]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if the great body of Federalists in New York really\r\nsympathised with their eastern brethren. Those who did, like\r\nGouverneur Morris, proclaimed their views in private and confidential\r\nletters. \"I care nothing more for your actings and doings,\" Morris\r\nwrote Pickering, then in Congress. \"Your decree of conscription and\r\nyour levy of contributions are alike indifferent to one whose eyes are\r\nfixed on a star in the east, which he believes to be the dayspring of\r\nfreedom and glory. The traitors and madmen assembled at Hartford will,\r\nI believe, if not too tame and timid, be hailed hereafter as the\r\npatriots and sages of their day and generation.\"[180] Looking back on\r\nthe history of that portentous event, one is shocked to learn that men\r\nlike Morris could have sympathy with the principle sought to be\r\nestablished; but if any leading New York Federalist disapproved the\r\nconvention's report he made no public record of it at the time.[181]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: Gouverneur Morris to Timothy Pickering, Dec. 22, 1814,\r\n_Morris's Works_, Vol. 3, p. 324.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: \"Among the least violent of Federalists was James\r\nLloyd, recently United States senator from Massachusetts. To John\r\nRandolph's letter, remonstrating against the Hartford Convention,\r\nLloyd advised the Virginians to coerce Madison into retirement, and to\r\nplace Rufus King in the Presidency as the alternative to a fatal\r\nissue. The assertion of such an alternative showed how desperate the\r\nsituation was believed by the moderate Federalists to be.\"--Henry\r\nAdams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 8, p. 306.]\r\n\r\nThe violent methods of New England governors in withdrawing their\r\nmilitia from the service of the United States, coupled with the action\r\nof the New York Federalists in calling a state convention to determine\r\nwhat course their party should pursue, were well calculated to arouse\r\nGovernor Tompkins, who welcomed the privilege of upholding the general\r\ngovernment. He did not minimise the gravity of the situation. Perhaps\r\nhe did not feel the alarm expressed in Jefferson's letter to Gallatin,\r\na year after the crisis had passed; for he now had behind him a\r\npatriotic Legislature and the nucleus of an invincible army under\r\ntrained leadership. But if the war had continued, and, as the\r\nWashington authorities anticipated, the British had prevailed at New\r\nOrleans, he would have found a New England confederacy to the east of\r\nhim as well as an army of English veterans on the north.\r\n\r\nThe conditions that faced Madison made peace his last hope. American\r\ncommissioners were already in Europe; but as month after month passed\r\nwithout agreement, the darkest hour of the war seemed to have settled\r\nupon the country. Suddenly, on the 4th of February, 1815, the\r\nstartling and glorious news of General Jackson's decisive victory at\r\nNew Orleans electrified the nation. A week later, a British sloop of\r\nwar sailed into New York harbour, announcing that the treaty of Ghent\r\nhad been signed on the 24th of the preceding December. Instantly\r\nMadison's troubles disappeared. The war was over, the Hartford\r\ncommissioners were out of employment, and the happy phrase of Charles\r\nJ. Ingersoll of Pennsylvania became the popular summing up of the\r\ntreaty--\"not an inch ceded or lost.\" Jackson's victory had not entered\r\ninto the peace negotiations; but intelligent men knew that the superb\r\nfighting along the Canadian frontier during the campaign of 1814, had\r\nhad much to do in bringing about the result. Beginning with the battle\r\nof Chippewa, where equal bodies of troops met face to face, in broad\r\ndaylight, on an open field, without advantage of position, the\r\nAmerican army faced British troops with the skill and desperate\r\ncourage that characterised the struggle between the North and the\r\nSouth forty years later.\r\n\r\nAmong civilians most admired for their part in the struggle, Daniel D.\r\nTompkins stood first. The genius of an American governor had never\r\nbeen more nobly employed, and, although he was sometimes swayed by\r\nprejudice and the impulses of his personal ambition, he did enough to\r\nshow that he was devotedly attached to his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nCLINTON OVERTHROWN\r\n\r\n1815\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election of a Republican Assembly in the spring of 1814 opened the\r\nway for a Republican Council of Appointment, composed of Jonathan\r\nDayton, representing the southern district, Lucas Elmendorff the\r\nmiddle, Ruggles Hubbard the eastern, and Ferrand Stranahan the\r\nwestern. Elmendorff had been two years in the Assembly, six years in\r\nCongress, and was now serving the first year of a single term in the\r\nState Senate; but like his less experienced colleagues he was on the\r\nCouncil simply to carry out the wishes of the leaders. It had been\r\nthree years since Republicans had tasted the sweets of office, and a\r\nhungrier horde of applicants never besieged the capital. Yet so\r\ndextrous had politicians become in making changes from one party to\r\nthe other, that the Council's work must have ended in a week had not\r\nthe jealousies, until now veiled by the war, quickly developed into a\r\nconflict destined to reconcile Ambrose Spencer and DeWitt Clinton, and\r\nto rivet the friendly relations between Governor Tompkins and Martin\r\nVan Buren.\r\n\r\nVan Buren desired to become attorney-general. He had been\r\nconspicuously prominent almost from the day he entered the Senate;\r\nand, after the Republicans recovered control of the Assembly, he was\r\nthe acknowledged legislative leader of his party. By his persuasive\r\neloquence, his gift of argument, and his political tact in obtaining\r\nsupporters, he secured the passage of a \"classification bill\" which\r\ndivided the military population of the State into twelve thousand\r\nclasses, each class being required to furnish one able-bodied soldier\r\nby voluntary enlistment, by bounty, or by draft. \"This act,\" declared\r\nThomas H. Benton, years afterward, \"was the most energetic war measure\r\never adopted in the country.\"[182] There appears to be a general\r\nagreement among writers who have commented upon the character of Van\r\nBuren and his work at this period of his career, that, next to the\r\nGovernor among civilians, Van Buren was most entitled to the gratitude\r\nof his party and his State. Besides, his smooth and pleasing address\r\nhad become more fascinating the longer he continued in the Senate,\r\nuntil his influence among legislators was equalled only by the kindly\r\nand sympathetic Tompkins, whose success in the war had won him a place\r\nin the hearts of men similar to that enjoyed by George Clinton after\r\nthe close of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: Edward M. Shepard, _Martin Van Buren_, p. 62.]\r\n\r\nBut popular and deserving as Van Buren was Ambrose Spencer opposed his\r\npreferment. He saw in the brilliant young legislator an obstacle to\r\nhis own influence; and to break his strength at the earliest moment he\r\nadvocated for attorney-general the candidacy of John Woodworth.\r\nWoodworth was filling the position when the Federalists installed\r\nAbraham Van Vechten; his right to restoration appealed with peculiar\r\nforce to his party friends. Ruggles Hubbard of the Council,\r\nrepresenting Woodworth's district, naturally inclined to his support,\r\nbut Stranahan had no other interest in his candidacy than a desire to\r\nplease Spencer. This left the Council a tie. There can be no question\r\nthat Tompkins was in thorough accord with Van Buren's wishes, and that\r\nhe regarded Spencer with almost unqualified dislike, but he was a\r\ncandidate for President and naturally preferred keeping out of\r\ntrouble. Nevertheless, when it required his vote to settle the\r\ncontroversy he gave it ungrudgingly to Van Buren. In selecting a\r\nsecretary of state, the Governor applied the same rule. Spencer's\r\nfriend, Elisha Jenkins, had previously held the office, and, like\r\nWoodworth, desired reinstatement; but Tompkins--tossing Jenkins aside\r\nand ignoring Samuel Young, speaker of the Assembly, who was promised\r\nand expected the office--insisted upon Peter B. Porter, now a hero of\r\nthe Niagara frontier.\r\n\r\nSpencer had long realised that Tompkins was turning against him. It is\r\ndoubtful if the Governor ever felt a personal liking for this\r\npolitical meddling judge, although he accepted his services during the\r\nwar with a certain degree of confidence. But now that hostilities were\r\nat an end, he proposed to distribute patronage along lines of his own\r\nchoosing. Porter had recently been elected to Congress, and his\r\npresence in Washington would help the Governor's presidential\r\naspirations, especially if the young soldier's friendship was sealed\r\nin advance by the unsolicited honour of an appointment as secretary of\r\nstate. For the same reason, he desired the election of Nathan Sanford\r\nto the United States Senate to succeed Obadiah German. Spencer\r\nfavoured John Armstrong, late secretary of war, and when the latter\r\nwas thrust aside as utterly undesirable, the Judge announced his own\r\ncandidacy. But Van Buren, resenting Spencer's opposition, skilfully\r\nresisted his claims until he grew timid and declined to compete \"with\r\nso young a man as Mr. Sanford.\" Fourteen years divided their ages.\r\n\r\nThe change Republicans most clamoured for had not, however, come yet.\r\nDeWitt Clinton still held the mayoralty. Spencer urged his removal and\r\ncontrolled Stranahan; the Martling Men demanded it and controlled\r\nDayton; but Elmendorff and Hubbard hesitated, and Tompkins disliked\r\ngiving the casting vote. The Governor realised that no statesman had\r\nlived in his day in whom the people had shown greater confidence; and,\r\nin spite of the present clamour, he knew that the iron-willed Mayor\r\nstill possessed the friendship of the best men and ripest scholars in\r\nthe State. DeWitt Clinton was seen at his best, no doubt, by those who\r\nknew him in private life, among his books; and, though his strong\r\nopinions and earnest desire to maintain his side of the controversy,\r\nbrought him into frequent antagonisms, his guests were encouraged to\r\ngive free utterance to their own ideas and views.\r\n\r\nThese same qualities made him an active, restless leader of men in the\r\nworld of politics. No doubt many hated him, for he made enemies more\r\neasily than friends; but neither enemy nor friend could deny the great\r\nnatural capacity which had gradually gained a commanding place for him\r\nin public life. Tompkins must have felt that it was only a question of\r\ntime when Clinton would again win the confidence of the people and\r\nmake his enemies his footstool. What, therefore, to do with him was a\r\nserious question. Chained or unchained he was dangerous. The free\r\nmasonry of intellect and education gave him rank; and if compelled to\r\nsurrender the mayoralty he might, at any moment, take up some work\r\nwhich would bring him greater fame and influence. Nevertheless,\r\nTompkins felt compelled to reach some decision. The Martling Men were\r\ninsistent. They charged that Clinton, inspired by unpatriotic motives\r\nin the interest of Federalism, had opposed the war, and was an enemy\r\nof his party; and in demanding his removal they threatened those who\r\ncaused delay. Van Buren could probably have relieved Tompkins by\r\ninfluencing Elmendorff, but Van Buren, like Tompkins, was too shrewd\r\nto rush into trouble.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if the possibility of a reconciliation between Spencer\r\nand Clinton occurred to Van Buren, and, if it did, it must have seemed\r\ntoo remote seriously to be considered; for just then Spencer was\r\nindefatigable in his exertions on the opposite side. Van Buren,\r\nmoreover, understood politics too well to be blind to the danger of\r\nincurring the hostility of such a mind. A man who could bring to\r\npolitical work such resources of thought and of experience, who could\r\nlook beneath the surface and see clearly in what direction and by what\r\nmethods progress was to be made, was not one to be trifled with.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Ruggles Hubbard had a sincere attachment for Clinton. In\r\nsupporting his presidential aspirations Hubbard visited Vermont, where\r\nhe exercised his companionable gifts in an effort to obtain for\r\nClinton the vote of that State. But Hubbard had neither firmness nor\r\nstrength of intellect. Irregular in his habits, lax in his morals, a\r\nspendthrift and an insolvent, he could not resist the incessant\r\nattacks upon Clinton, nor the offer of the shrievalty of New York,\r\nwith its large income and fat fees. When, therefore, Elmendorff\r\nfinally evidenced a disposition to yield, Hubbard made the vote for\r\nClinton's removal unanimous.\r\n\r\nThere have been seventy-nine mayors of New York since Thomas Willett,\r\nin 1665, first took charge of its affairs under the iron rule of Peter\r\nStuyvesant, but only one in the long list, averaging a tenure of three\r\nyears each, served longer than DeWitt Clinton. Richard Varick, the\r\nmilitary secretary of Schuyler and Washington, and the distinguished\r\nassociate of Samuel Jones in revising the laws of the State, held the\r\nmayoralty from 1789 to 1801, continuing through the controlling life\r\nof the Federalist party and the closing years of a century full of\r\nheroic incident in the history of the city. But DeWitt Clinton,\r\nholding office from 1803 to 1815--save the two years given Marinus\r\nWillett and Jacob Radcliff--saw the city's higher life keep pace with\r\nits growth and aided in the forces that widened its achievement and\r\nmade it a financial centre. It must have cost this master-spirit of\r\nhis age a deep sigh to give up a position in which his work had been\r\nso wise and helpful. His situation, indeed, seemed painfully gloomy;\r\nhis office was gone, his salary was spent, and his estate was\r\nbankrupt. It is doubtful if a party leader ever came to a more\r\ndistressing period in his career; yet he preserved his dignity and\r\nlaughed at the storm that howled so fiercely about him. \"Genuine\r\ngreatness,\" he said, in a memorial address delivered about this time,\r\n\"never appears in a more resplendent light, or in a more sublime\r\nattitude, than in that buoyancy of character which rises superior to\r\ndanger and difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Governor Tompkins was riding on the crest of the\r\npolitical waves. On February 14, 1816, a legislative caucus\r\nunanimously instructed the members of Congress from New York to\r\nsupport him for President; a week later it nominated him for governor.\r\nTompkins had no desire to make a fourth race for governor, but the\r\nunexpected nomination of Rufus King left him no alternative. William\r\nW. Van Ness had been determined upon as the Federalist candidate,\r\nuntil the fraudulent capture of the Council of Appointment by the\r\nRepublicans made it inadvisable for the popular young Judge to leave\r\nthe bench; and to save the party from disruption Rufus King consented\r\nto head the Federalist ticket. His great strength quickly put\r\nRepublicans on the defensive; and the only man whom the party dared to\r\noppose to him was the favourite champion of the war. Tompkins'\r\nre-election by over six thousand majority[183] once more attested his\r\nwidespread popularity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: Daniel D. Tompkins, 45,412; Rufus King, 38,647.--_Civil\r\nList, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nFor the moment, every one seemed to be carried away by the fascination\r\nof the man. His friends asserted that he was always right and always\r\nsuccessful; that patriotism had guided him through the long,\r\ndiscouraging war, and that, swayed neither by prejudice, nor by the\r\nimpulses of personal ambition, in every step he took and every measure\r\nhe recommended, he was actuated by the most unselfish purpose. Of\r\ncourse, this was the extravagance of enthusiastic admirers; but it was\r\nfounded on twelve years of public life, marked by success and by few\r\nerrors of judgment or temper. Even Federalists ceased to be his\r\ncritics. It is not easy to parallel Governor Tompkins' standing at\r\nthis time. If DeWitt Clinton's position seemed most wretched,\r\nTompkins' lot appeared most happy. His life had been pure and noble;\r\nhe was a sincere lover of his country; a brave and often a daring\r\nexecutive; a statesman of high purpose if not of the most commanding\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\nThere was one man, however, with whom he must reckon. Ambrose Spencer\r\nnot only loved power, but he loved to exercise it. He lacked the\r\naddress of Tompkins, and, likewise, the vein of levity in the\r\nGovernor's temperament that made him buoyant and hopeful even when\r\nmost eager and earnest; but he was bold, enterprising, and of\r\ncommanding intellect, with a determination to do with all his might\r\nthe part he had to perform. His failure to become United States\r\nsenator, and the appointment of Van Buren and Porter in place of\r\nWoodworth and Elisha Jenkins, rankled in his bosom. That was his first\r\ndefeat. More than this, it proved that he could be defeated. Since\r\nDeWitt Clinton's defection in 1812, he had been the most powerful\r\npolitical factor in the State, a man whom the Governor had found it\r\nexpedient to tolerate and to welcome.\r\n\r\nThe events of the past year had, however, convinced Spencer that\r\nnothing was to be gained by longer adherence to Tompkins, whom he had\r\nnow come to regard with distrust and dislike. When, therefore, a\r\ncandidate for President began to be talked about he promptly favoured\r\nWilliam H. Crawford. The Georgia statesman, high tempered and\r\noverbearing, showed the faults of a strong nature, coupled with an\r\nambition which made him too fond of intrigue; but Gallatin declared\r\nthat he united to a powerful mind a most correct judgment and an\r\ninflexible integrity. In the United States Senate, with the courage\r\nand independence of Clay and the intelligence of Gallatin, he had been\r\nan earnest advocate of war and a formidable critic of its conduct.\r\nCompared to Monroe he was an intellectual giant, whose name was as\r\nfamiliar in New York as that of the President, and whose character was\r\nvastly more admired. In favouring such a candidate it may be easily\r\nunderstood how the influence of a man like Spencer affected other\r\nstate leaders. Their dislike of the Virginian was as pronounced as in\r\n1812, while their faith in the success of Tompkins, of whom Southern\r\ncongressmen knew as little as they did of DeWitt Clinton four years\r\nbefore, was not calculated to inspire them with the zeal of\r\nmissionaries. Spencer's bold declaration in favour of Crawford,\r\ntherefore, hurt Tompkins more than his hesitation to support his\r\nbrother-in-law in 1812 had damaged Clinton.\r\n\r\nIn the early autumn of 1814, the President had invited the Governor to\r\nbecome his secretary of state. Madison had been naturally drawn\r\ntoward Tompkins, who had shown from his first entrance into public\r\nlife a remarkable capacity for diplomatic management; and, although he\r\nhad none of the higher faculties of statesmanship, the President\r\nprobably saw that he would make just the kind of a minister to suit\r\nhis purposes. Armstrong had not done this. Although a man of some\r\nability and military information, Armstrong lacked conventional\r\nmorals, and was the possessor of objectionable peculiarities. He never\r\nwon either the confidence or the respect of Madison. He not only did\r\nharsh things in a harsh way, but he had a caustic tongue, and a tone\r\nof irreverence whenever he estimated the capacity of a Virginia\r\nstatesman. On the other hand, Tompkins had gentleness, and that\r\nrefined courtesy, amounting almost to tenderness, which seemed so\r\nnecessary in successfully dealing with Madison.\r\n\r\nThe desire to be first in every path of political success had become\r\nsuch a passion in Tompkins' nature that the question presented by the\r\nPresident's invitation found an answer in the immediate impulses of\r\nhis ambition. No doubt his duties as Governor and the importance of\r\nhis remaining through the impending crisis appealed to him, but they\r\ndid not control his answer. He wanted to be President, and he was\r\nwilling to sacrifice anything or anybody to secure the prize. So, it\r\nis not surprising that he declined Madison's gracious offer, since the\r\nexperience of Northern men with Virginia Presidents did not encourage\r\nthe belief that the Presidency was reached through the Cabinet.[184]\r\nYet, had Tompkins fully appreciated, as he did after it was too late,\r\nthe importance of a personal and pleasant acquaintance with the\r\nVirginia statesman and the other men who controlled congressional\r\ncaucuses, he would undoubtedly have entered Madison's Cabinet. As the\r\nranking, and, save Monroe, the oldest of the President's advisers, he\r\nwould have had two years in which to make himself popular, a\r\nsufficient time, surely, for one having the prestige of a great war\r\ngovernor, with gentleness of manner and sweetness of temper to disarm\r\nall opposition and to conciliate even the fiercest of politicians.\r\nFifteen years later Martin Van Buren resigned the governorship to go\r\nto the head of Jackson's Cabinet, and it made him President.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: Henry Adams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 8, p.\r\n163.]\r\n\r\nIt is not at all unlikely that Madison had it in mind to make Tompkins\r\nhis successor. He had little liking for his jealous secretary of state\r\nwho had opposed his nomination in 1808, criticised the conduct of the\r\nwar, and forced the retirement of cabinet colleagues and the removal\r\nof favourite army officers--who had, in a word, dominated the\r\nPresident until the latter became almost as tired of him as of\r\nArmstrong. But, as the time approached for the nomination of a new\r\nExecutive, Madison's jealous regard for Virginia, as well as his\r\nknowledge of Monroe's fitness, induced him to sustain the candidate\r\nfrom his own State. This was notice to federal office-holders in New\r\nYork to get into line for the Virginian; and very soon some of\r\nTompkins' closest friends began falling away. To add to the Governor's\r\nunhappiness, the Administration, repeating its tactics toward the\r\nClintons in 1808 and 1812, began exalting his enemies. In sustaining\r\nDeWitt Clinton's aspirations Solomon Southwick had actively opposed\r\nthe Virginia dynasty and bitterly assailed Tompkins and Spencer for\r\ntheir desertion of the eminent New Yorker. For three years he had\r\npractically excluded himself from the Republican party, criticising\r\nthe war with the severity of a Federalist, and continually\r\nanimadverting upon the conduct of the President and the Governor; but\r\nMonroe's influence now made this peppery editor of the _Register_\r\npostmaster at Albany, turning his paper into an ardent advocate of the\r\nVirginian's promotion. The Governor, who had openly encouraged such a\r\npolicy when DeWitt Clinton sought the Presidency, now felt the\r\nVirginia knife entering his own vitals.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's part in Tompkins' disappointment, although not active,\r\nshowed the shrewdness of a clever politician. He had learned something\r\nof national politics since he advocated the candidacy of DeWitt\r\nClinton so enthusiastically four years before. He knew the Governor\r\nwas seriously bent upon being President, and that his friends\r\nthroughout the State were joining in the bitterness of the old Clinton\r\ncry that Virginia had ruled long enough--a cry which old John Adams\r\nhad taken up, declaring that \"My son will never have a chance until\r\nthe last Virginian is laid in the graveyard;\" but Van Buren knew,\r\nalso, that few New Yorkers in Washington had any hope of Tompkins'\r\nsuccess. It was the situation of 1812 over again. Tompkins was\r\npersonally unknown to the country; Crawford and Monroe were national\r\nleaders of wide acquaintance, who practically divided the strength of\r\ntheir party. Could Van Buren have made Tompkins the President, he\r\nwould have done so without hesitation; but he had little disposition\r\nto tie himself up, as he did with Clinton in 1812, and let Crawford,\r\nwith Spencer's assistance, take the office and hand the patronage of\r\nNew York over to the Judge. The Kinderhook statesman, therefore,\r\ndeclared for Tompkins, and carried the Legislature for him in spite of\r\nSpencer's support of Crawford; then, with the wariness of an old\r\ncampaigner, he prevented New York congressmen from expressing any\r\npreference, although three-fourths of them favoured Crawford. When the\r\ncongressional caucus finally met to select a candidate, Van Buren had\r\nthe situation so muddled that it is not known to this day just how the\r\nNew York congressmen did vote. Monroe, however, was not unmindful of\r\nthe service rendered him. After the latter's nomination, Tompkins was\r\nnamed for Vice President; and if he did not resent taking second\r\nplace, as George Clinton did in 1808, it was because the Vice\r\nPresidency offered changed conditions, enlarged acquaintance, and one\r\nstep upward on the political ladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nCLINTON'S RISE TO POWER\r\n\r\n1815-1817\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was never a time, probably, when the white man, conversant with\r\nthe rivers and lakes of New York, did not talk of a continuous passage\r\nby water from Lake Erie to the sea. As early as 1724, when Cadwallader\r\nColden was surveyor-general of the colony, he declared the opportunity\r\nfor inland navigation in New York without a parallel in any other part\r\nof the world, and as the Mohawk Valley, reaching out toward the lakes\r\nof Oneida and Cayuga, and connecting by easy grades with the Genesee\r\nRiver beyond, opened upon his vision, it filled him with admiration.\r\nEven then the thrifty settler, pushing his way into the picturesque\r\ncountry of the Iroquois, had determined to pre-empt the valleys whose\r\nmeanderings furnished the blackest loam and richest meadows, and whose\r\ngently receding foot-hills offered sites for the most attractive homes\r\nin the vicinity of satisfactory and enduring markets. It was this\r\nscene that impressed Joseph Carver in 1776. Carver was an explorer. He\r\nhad traversed the country from New York to Green Bay, and looking back\r\nupon the watery path he saw nothing to prevent the great Northwest\r\nfrom being connected with the ocean by means of canals and the natural\r\nwaterways of New York. In one of the rhetorical flights of his young\r\nmanhood, Gouverneur Morris declared that \"at no distant day the waters\r\nof the great inland seas would, by the aid of man, break through their\r\nbarriers and mingle with those of the Hudson.\" George Washington had\r\nvisions of the same vast system as he traversed the State, in 1783,\r\nwith George Clinton, on his way to the headwaters of the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nThese were the dreams of statesmen, whose realisation, however, was\r\nyet far, very far, away. In 1768, long after \"Old Silver Locks\" had\r\nbecome the distinguished lieutenant-governor, he induced Sir Henry\r\nMoore, the gay and affable successor of Governor Monckton, to ascend\r\nthe Mohawk for the supreme purpose of projecting a canal around Little\r\nFalls. Sixteen years later, in 1784, the Legislature tendered\r\nChristopher Colles the entire profits of the navigation of the river\r\nif he would improve it; yet work did not follow words. It was easy to\r\nsee what might be done, but the man did not appear who could do it. In\r\n1791, George Clinton took a hand, securing the incorporation of a\r\ncompany to open navigation from the Hudson to Lake Ontario. The\r\ncompany completed three sections of a canal--aggregating six miles in\r\nlength, with five leaky locks--at a cost of four hundred thousand\r\ndollars, but the price of transportation was not cheapened, nor the\r\ntime shortened. This seemed to end all money effort. Other canal\r\ncompanies were organised, one to build between the Hudson and Lake\r\nChamplain, another to connect the Oswego River with Cayuga and Seneca\r\nlakes; but the projects came to nothing. Finally, in 1805, the\r\nLegislature authorised Simeon DeWitt, the surveyor-general, to cause\r\nthe several routes to be accurately surveyed; and, after he had\r\nreported the feasibility of constructing a canal without serious\r\ndifficulty from Lake Erie to the Hudson, a commission of seven men,\r\nappointed in 1810, estimated the cost of such construction at five\r\nmillion dollars. It was hoped the general government would assist in\r\nmaking up this sum; but it soon became apparent that the war, into\r\nwhich the country was rapidly drifting, would use up the national\r\nsurplus, while rival projects divided attention and lessened the\r\nenthusiasm. Efforts to secure a right of way, developed the avarice of\r\nlandowners, who demanded large damages for the privilege. Thus,\r\ndiscouragement succeeded discouragement until a majority of the\r\nearlier friends of the canal gave up in despair.\r\n\r\nBut there was one man who did not weaken. DeWitt Clinton had been\r\nmade a member of the Canal Commission in 1810, and with Gouverneur\r\nMorris, Peter B. Porter and other associates, he explored the entire\r\nroute, keeping a diary and carefully noting each obstacle in the way.\r\nIn 1811, he introduced and forced the passage of a bill clothing the\r\ncommission with full power to act; and, afterward, he visited\r\nWashington with Gouverneur Morris to obtain aid from Congress. Then\r\ncame the war, and, later, in 1815, Clinton's overthrow and retirement.\r\n\r\nThis involuntary leisure gave Clinton just the time needed to hasten\r\nthe work which was to transmit his name to later generations. Bitterly\r\nmortified over his defeat, he retired to a farm at Newton on Long\r\nIsland, where he lived for a time in strict seclusion, indulging, it\r\nwas said, too freely in strong drink. But if Clinton lacked patience,\r\nand temporarily, perhaps, the virtue of temperance, he did not lack\r\nforce of will and strength of intellect. He corresponded with men of\r\ninfluence; sought the assistance of capitalists; held public meetings;\r\nand otherwise endeavoured to enlist the co-operation of people who\r\nwould be benefited, and to arouse a public sentiment which should\r\novercome doubt and stir into activity men of force and foresight.\r\nWriting from Buffalo, in July, 1816, he declared that \"in all human\r\nprobability, before the passing away of the present generation,\r\nBuffalo will be the second city in the State.\"[185] A month later,\r\nhaving examined \"the land and the water with scrutinising eye,\r\nsuperintending our operations and exploring all our facilities and\r\nembarrassments\" from the great drop at Lockport to the waters of the\r\nMohawk at Utica, he again refers to the future Queen City of the Lakes\r\nwith prophetic power. \"Buffalo is to be the point of beginning, and in\r\nfifty years it will be next to New York in wealth and population.\"[186]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 411.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: _Ibid._, Vol. 50, p. 411.]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if any statesman endowed with less genius than Clinton\r\ncould have kept the project alive during this period of indifference\r\nand discouragement. Even Thomas Jefferson doubted the feasibility of\r\nthe plan, declaring that it was a century in advance of the age. \"I\r\nconfess,\" wrote Rufus King, long after its construction had become\r\nassured, \"that looking at the distance between Erie and the Hudson,\r\nand taking into view the hills and valleys and rivers and morasses\r\nover which the canal must pass, I have felt some doubts whether the\r\nunaided resources of the State would be competent to its\r\nexecution.\"[187] But Clinton had a nature and a spirit which inclined\r\nhim to favour daring plans, and he seems to have made up his mind that\r\nnothing should hinder him from carrying out the enterprise he had at\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: Charles R. King, _Life and Correspondence of Rufus\r\nKing_, Vol. 6, p. 97.]\r\n\r\nIn the end, he compelled the acceptance of his project by a stroke of\r\nhappy audacity. A great meeting of New York merchants, held in the\r\nautumn of 1815, appointed him chairman of a committee to memorialise\r\nthe Legislature. With a fund of information, obtained by personal\r\ninspection of the route, he set forth with rhetorical effect and great\r\nclearness the inestimable advantages that must come to city and to\r\nState; and, with the ease of a financier, inspired with sounder views\r\nthan had been observed in the care of his own estate, he demonstrated\r\nthe manner of securing abundant funds for the great work. \"If the\r\nproject of a canal,\" he said, in conclusion, \"was intended to advance\r\nthe views of individuals, or to foment the divisions of party; if it\r\npromoted the interests of a few at the expense of the prosperity of\r\nthe many; if its benefits were limited to place, or fugitive as to\r\nduration; then, indeed, it might be received with cold indifference or\r\ntreated with stern neglect; but the overflowing blessings from this\r\ngreat fountain of public good and national abundance will be as\r\nextensive as our own country and as durable as time. It may be\r\nconfidently asserted that this canal, as to the extent of its route,\r\nas to the countries which it connects, and as to the consequences\r\nwhich it will produce, is without a parallel in the history of\r\nmankind. It remains for a free state to create a new era in history,\r\nand to erect a work more stupendous, more magnificent, and more\r\nbeneficial than has hitherto been achieved by the human race.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the people heard and read this memorial, monster mass-meetings,\r\nheld at Albany and other points along the proposed waterway, gave vent\r\nto acclamations of joy; and Clinton was welcomed whenever and wherever\r\nhe appeared. These marks of public favour were by no means confined to\r\nthe lower classes. Men of large property openly espoused his cause;\r\nand when the Legislature convened, in January, 1816, a new commission,\r\nwith Clinton at its head, was authorised to make surveys and\r\nestimates, receive grants and donations, and report to the next\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nIt was a great triumph for Clinton. He went to Albany a political\r\noutcast, he returned to New York gilded with the first rays of a new\r\nand rising career, destined to be as remarkable as the most romantic\r\nstory belonging to the early days of the last century. To make his\r\nsuccess the more conspicuous, it became known, before the legislative\r\nsession ended, that his quarrel with Spencer had been settled.\r\nSpencer's wife, who was Clinton's sister, had earnestly striven to\r\nbring them together; but neither Spencer nor Clinton was made of the\r\nstuff likely to allow family affection to interfere with the promotion\r\nof their careers. As time went on, however, it became more and more\r\nevident to Spencer that some alliance must be formed against the\r\nincreasing influence of Van Buren and Tompkins; and, with peace once\r\ndeclared with Clinton, their new friendship began just where the old\r\nalliance left off. In an instant, like quarrelling lovers,\r\nestrangement was forgotten and their interests and ambitions became\r\nmutual. Of all Clinton's critics, Spencer had been the meanest and\r\nfiercest; of all his friends, he was now the warmest and most\r\nenthusiastic. To turn Clinton's enemies into friends was as earnestly\r\nand daringly undertaken by Spencer, as the old-time work of turning\r\nhis friends into enemies; and before the summer of 1816 had advanced\r\ninto the sultry days of August, Spencer boldly proclaimed Clinton his\r\ncandidate for governor to take the place of Tompkins, who was to\r\nbecome Vice President on the 4th of March, 1817. It was an audacious\r\npolitical move; and one of less daring mind might well have hesitated;\r\nbut it is hardly too much to say of Spencer, that he combined in\r\nhimself all the qualities of daring, foresight, energy, enterprise,\r\nand cool, calculating sagacity, which must be united in order to make\r\na consummate political leader.\r\n\r\nTompkins, like Jefferson, had never taken kindly to the canal project.\r\nIn his message to the Legislature, in February, 1816, he simply\r\nsuggested that it rested with them to determine whether the scheme was\r\nsufficiently important to demand the appropriation of some part of the\r\nrevenues of the State \"without imposing too great a burden upon our\r\nconstituents.\"[188] The great meetings held in the preceding autumn\r\nhad forced this recognition of the existence of such a project; but\r\nhis carefully measured words, and his failure to express an opinion as\r\nto its wisdom or desirability, chilled some of the enthusiasm formerly\r\nexhibited for him. To add to the people's disappointment and chagrin,\r\nthe Governor omitted all mention of the subject on the 5th of\r\nNovember, when the Legislature assembled to choose presidential\r\nelectors--an omission which he repeated on the 21st of January, 1817,\r\nwhen the Legislature met in regular session, although the construction\r\nof a canal was just then attracting more attention than all other\r\nquestions before the public. If Clinton failed to realise the loss of\r\npopularity that would follow his loss of the Presidency in 1812,\r\nTompkins certainly failed to appreciate the reaction that would follow\r\nhis repudiation of the canal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: _Governors' Speeches_, February 2, 1816, p. 132.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature convened, the new Canal Commission, through\r\nDeWitt Clinton, presented an exhaustive report, estimating the cost of\r\nthe Erie canal, three hundred and fifty-three miles long, forty feet\r\nwide at the surface, and twenty-eight feet at the bottom, with\r\nseventy-seven locks, at $4,571,813. The cost of the Champlain canal\r\nwas fixed at $871,000. It was suggested that money, secured by loan,\r\ncould be subsequently repaid without taxation; and on the strength of\r\nthis report, a bill for the construction of both canals was\r\nimmediately introduced in the two houses. This action produced a\r\nprofound impression throughout the State. The only topics discussed\r\nfrom New York to Buffalo, were the magnificent scheme of opening a\r\nnavigable waterway between the Hudson and the lakes, and the\r\ndesirability of having the man build it who had made its construction\r\npossible. This, of course, meant Clinton for governor.\r\n\r\nTalk of Clinton's candidacy was very general when the Legislature\r\nassembled, in January, 1817; and, although Van Buren had hitherto\r\nattached little importance to it, the discovery that a strong and\r\nconsiderable part of the Legislature, backed by the stalwart Spencer,\r\nnow openly favoured the nomination of the canal champion, set him to\r\nwork planning a way of escape. His suggestion that Tompkins serve as\r\ngovernor and vice president found little more favour than the scheme\r\nof allowing Lieutenant-Governor Taylor to act as governor; for the\r\nformer plan was as objectionable to Tompkins and the people, as the\r\nlatter was plainly illegal. It is doubtful if Van Buren seriously\r\napproved either expedient; but it gave him time to impress upon party\r\nfriends the objections to Clinton's restoration to power. He did not\r\ngo back to 1812. That would have condemned himself. But he recalled\r\nthe ex-Mayor's open, bitter opposition to Tompkins in 1813, and the\r\nsteady support given him by the Federalists. In proof of this\r\nstatement he pointed to the present indisposition of Federalists to\r\noppose Clinton if nominated, and their avowed declarations that\r\nClinton's views paralleled their own.\r\n\r\nVan Buren had shown, from his first entrance into public life, a\r\nremarkable faculty for winning men to his own way of thinking. His\r\ncriticism of Clinton was now directed with characteristic sagacity and\r\nskill. His argument, that the object of those who sustained Clinton\r\nwas to establish a conspiracy with the Federalists at home and\r\nabroad, for the overthrow of the Republican party in the nation as\r\nwell as in the State, seemed justified by the open support of William\r\nW. Van Ness, the gifted young justice of the Supreme Court. Further to\r\nconfirm his contention, Jonas Platt, now of the Supreme bench, and\r\nJacob Rutsen Van Rensselaer of Columbia, a bold, active, and most\r\nzealous partisan, who had served in the Legislature and as secretary\r\nof state, made no secret of their intention to indorse Clinton's\r\nnomination, and, if necessary, to ride over the State to secure his\r\nelection. Under ordinary circumstances nothing could discredit the\r\nClinton agitation, with the more reasonable part of the Republican\r\nlegislators, more than Van Buren's charge, strengthened by such\r\nsupporting evidence.\r\n\r\nThe canal influences of the time, however, were too strong for any\r\ningenuity of argument, or adroitness in the raising of alarm, to\r\nprevail; and so the skilful manager turned his attention to Joseph G.\r\nYates, a judge of the Supreme Court, as an opposing candidate who\r\nmight be successful. Yates belonged to the old-fashioned American type\r\nof handsome men. He had a large, shapely head, a prominent nose, full\r\nlips, and a face cleanly shaven and rosy. His bearing was excellent,\r\nhis voice, manner, and everything about him bespoke the gentleman; but\r\nneither in aspect nor manner of speech did he measure up to his real\r\ndesire for political preferment. Yet he had many popular qualities\r\nwhich commended him to the rank and file of his party. He was a man of\r\nabstemious habits and boundless industry, whose courtesy and square\r\ndealing made him a favourite. Few errors of a political character\r\ncould be charged to his account. He had favoured Clinton for\r\nPresident; he had supported Tompkins and the war with great zeal, and,\r\nto the full extent of his ability and influence, he had proved an\r\nardent friend of the canal policy.\r\n\r\nIt had been a trait of the Yates family--ever since its founder, an\r\nenterprising English yeoman, a native of Leeds in Yorkshire, had\r\nsettled in the colony during the troublous days of Charles I.--to\r\nespouse any movement or improvement which should benefit the people.\r\nJoseph had already shown his activity and usefulness in founding Union\r\nCollege; he regarded the proposed canal as a long step in the\r\ndevelopment and prosperity of the State; but he did not take kindly to\r\nVan Buren's suggestion that he become a candidate for governor against\r\nClinton. In this respect he was unlike Robert, chief justice, his\r\nfather's cousin, who first ran for governor on the Federalist ticket\r\nat the suggestion of Hamilton, and, three years later, as an\r\nanti-Federalist candidate at the suggestion of George Clinton,\r\nsuffering defeat on both occasions. He was, however, as ambitious as\r\nthe old Chief Justice; and, had the time seemed ripe, he would have\r\nresponded to the call of the Kinderhook statesman as readily as Robert\r\ndid to the appeals of Hamilton and George Clinton.\r\n\r\nPeter B. Porter was more willing. He belonged to the Tompkins-Van\r\nBuren faction which nourished the hope that the soldier, who had\r\nrecently borne the flag of his country in triumph on several\r\nbattlefields, would carry off the prize, although the caucus was to\r\nconvene in less than forty-eight hours. There could be no doubt of\r\nGeneral Porter's strength with the people. He had served his State and\r\nhis country with a fidelity that must forever class his name with the\r\nbravest officers of the War of 1812. He rode a horse like a centaur;\r\nand, wherever he appeared, whether equipped for a fight, or off for a\r\nhunt through the forests of the Niagara frontier, his easy, familiar\r\nmanners surrounded him with hosts of friends. The qualities that made\r\nhim a famous soldier made him, also, a favoured politician. As county\r\nclerk, secretary of state, and congressman, he had taken the keenest\r\ninterest in the great questions that agitated the political life of\r\nthe opening century; and as a canal commissioner, in 1811, he had\r\nsupported DeWitt Clinton with all the energy of an enthusiast.\r\n\r\nAt this time Porter was forty-four years old. He was a graduate of\r\nYale, a student of the law, and as quick in intelligence as he was\r\npleasing of countenance. His speeches, enlivened with gleams of\r\nhumour, rays of fancy, and flashes of eloquence, expressed the\r\nthoughts of an honourable, upright statesman who was justly esteemed\r\nof the first order of intellect. Certainly, if any one could take the\r\nnomination from DeWitt Clinton it was Peter B. Porter.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, had the nomination been left exclusively to Republican\r\nmembers of the Legislature, as it had been for forty years, Porter\r\nmight have been the choice of his party. Spencer, however, evidently\r\nfeared Van Buren's subtle control of the Legislature; for, early in\r\nthe winter, he began encouraging Republicans living in counties\r\nrepresented by Federalists, to demand a voice in the nominating\r\ncaucus. It was a novel idea. Up to this time, governors and\r\nlieutenant-governors had been nominated by members of the Legislature;\r\nyet the plan now suggested was so manifestly fair that few dared\r\noppose it. Why should the Republicans of Albany County, it was asked,\r\nbe denied the privilege of participating in the nomination of a\r\ngovernor simply because, being in a minority, they were unrepresented\r\nin the Legislature? There was no good reason; and, although Van Buren\r\nwell understood that such counties would return delegates generally\r\nfavourable to Clinton, he was powerless to defeat the reform. The\r\nresult was the beginning of nominating conventions, composed of\r\ndelegates selected by the people, and the nomination of DeWitt\r\nClinton.\r\n\r\nThe blow to Van Buren was a severe one. \"An obscure painter of the\r\nFlemish school,\" wrote Clinton to his friend and confidant, Henry\r\nPost, \"has made a very ludicrous and grotesque representation of Jonah\r\nimmediately after he was ejected from the whale's belly. He is\r\nrepresented as having a very bewildered and dismal physiognomy, not\r\nknowing from whence he came nor to what place bound. Just so looks Van\r\nBuren, the leader of the opposition party.\"[189] Yet Van Buren seems\r\nto have taken his defeat with more serenity and dignity than might\r\nhave been expected. Statesmen of far nobler character have allowed\r\nthemselves to indulge in futile demonstrations of disappointment and\r\nanger, but Van Buren displayed a remarkable evenness of temper. He\r\nadvocated with ability and sincerity the bill to construct the canal,\r\nwhich passed the Legislature on April 15, the last day of the session.\r\nIndeed, of the eighteen senators who favoured the project, five were\r\nbitter anti-Clintonians whose support was largely due to Van Buren.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 412.]\r\n\r\nIn this vote, the noes, in both Assembly and Senate, came from\r\nClinton's opponents, including the Tammany delegation and their\r\nfriends. From the outset Tammany, by solemn resolutions, had denounced\r\nthe canal project as impractical and chimerical, declaring it fit only\r\nfor a ditch in which to bury Clinton. At Albany its representatives\r\ngreeted the measure for its construction with a burst of mockery; and,\r\nby placing one obstacle after another in its way, nearly defeated it\r\nin the Senate. It was during this contest that the friends of Clinton\r\ncalled his opponents \"Bucktails\"--the name growing out of a custom,\r\nwhich obtained on certain festival occasions, when leading members of\r\nTammany wore the tail of a deer on their hats.\r\n\r\nRefusing to accept DeWitt Clinton, Tammany made Peter B. Porter its\r\ncandidate for governor. There is ample evidence that Porter never\r\nconcealed the chagrin or disappointment of defeat; but, though the\r\ndistinguished General must have known that his name was printed upon\r\nthe Tammany ticket and sent into every county in the State, he did not\r\nco-operate with Tammany in its effort to elect him. Other defections\r\nexisted in the party. Peter R. Livingston seemed to concentrate in\r\nhimself all the prejudices of his family against the Clintons. Moses\r\nI. Cantine of Catskill, a brother-in-law of Van Buren, though perhaps\r\nincapable of personal bitterness, opposed Clinton with such zeal that\r\nhe refused to vote either for a gubernatorial candidate, or for the\r\nconstruction of a canal. Samuel Young, who seemed to nourish a\r\ndeep-seated dislike of Clinton, never tired of disparaging the\r\nex-Mayor. He apparently took keen pleasure in holding up to ridicule\r\nand in satirising, what he was pleased to call his ponderous\r\npedantries, his solemn affectation of profundity and wisdom, his\r\nnarrow-mindedness, and his intolerable and transparent egotism. But\r\nthe canal sentiment was all one way. With the help of the Federalists,\r\nwho declined to make an opposing nomination, Clinton swept the State\r\nlike a cyclone, receiving nearly forty-four thousand votes out of a\r\ntotal of forty-five thousand.[190] Porter had less than fifteen\r\nhundred. Clinton's inauguration as governor occurred on the first day\r\nof July, 1817, and three days later he began the construction of the\r\nErie canal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: DeWitt Clinton, 43,310; Peter B. Porter, 1479.--_Civil\r\nList, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nBUCKTAIL AND CLINTONIAN\r\n\r\n1817-1819\r\n\r\n\r\nDeWitt Clinton had now reached the highest point in his political\r\ncareer. He was not merely all-powerful in the administration, he was\r\nthe administration. He delighted in the consciousness that he was\r\nlooked up to by men; that his success was fixed as a star in the\r\nfirmament; and that the greatest work of his life lay before him. He\r\nwas still in the prime of his days, only forty-eight years old, with a\r\nmarvellous capacity for work. It is said that he found a positive\r\ndelight in doing what seemed to others a wearisome and exhaustive tax\r\nupon physical endurance. \"The canal,\" he writes to his friend, Henry\r\nPost, in the month of his inauguration, \"is in a fine way. Ten miles\r\nwill be completely finished this season, and all within the estimate.\r\nThe application of the simple labour-saving machinery of our\r\ncontractors has the operation of magic. Trees, stumps, and everything\r\nvanish before it.\"[191] The exceptional work and responsibility put\r\nupon him during the construction of his \"big ditch,\" as his enemies\r\nsarcastically called it, might well have made him complain of the\r\nofficial burdens he had to bear; but neither by looks nor words did he\r\nindicate the slightest disposition to grumble. Nature had endowed him\r\nwith a genius for success. He loved literature, he delighted in\r\ncountry life, he was at home among farmers, and with those inclined to\r\nscience he analysed the flowers and turned with zest to a closer study\r\nof rocks and soils. No man ever enjoyed more thoroughly, or was\r\nbetter equipped intellectually to undertake such a career as he had\r\nnow entered upon. His audacity, too, amazed his enemies and delighted\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 412.]\r\n\r\nBut Clinton had learned nothing of the art of political management\r\neither in his retirement or by experience. He was the same\r\ndomineering, uncompromising, intolerant dictator, helpful only to\r\nthose who continually sounded his praises, cold and distant toward\r\nthose who acted with independence and spirit. He had made his enemies\r\nhis footstool; and he now assumed to be the recognised head of the\r\nparty whose destinies were in his keeping and whose fortunes were\r\nswayed by his will. It is, perhaps, too much to say that this was\r\npurely personal ambition. On the contrary, Clinton seems to have acted\r\non the honest conviction that he knew better than any other man how\r\nNew York ought to be governed, and the result of his effort inclines\r\none to the opinion that he was right in the belief. At all events, it\r\nis not surprising that a man of his energy and capacity for onward\r\nmovement should refuse to regulate his policy to the satisfaction of\r\nthe men that had recently crushed him to earth, and who, he knew,\r\nwould crush him again at the first opportunity. In this respect he was\r\nnot different from Van Buren; but Van Buren would have sought to\r\nplacate the least objectionable of his opponents, and to bring to his\r\nsupport men who were restless under the domination of others.\r\n\r\nClinton, however, did nothing of the kind. He would not even extend\r\nthe olive branch to Samuel Young after the latter had quarrelled with\r\nVan Buren. He preferred, evidently, to rely upon his old friends--even\r\nthough some of their names had become odious to the party--and upon a\r\ncoterie of brilliant Federalists, led by William W. Van Ness, Jonas\r\nPlatt, and Thomas J. Oakley, with whom he was already upon terms of\r\nconfidential communication. He professed to believe that the\r\nprinciples of Republican and Federalist were getting to be somewhat\r\nundefined in their character; and that the day was not far off, if,\r\nindeed, it had not already come, when the Republican party would\r\nbreak into two factions, and, for the real business of statesmanship,\r\ndivide the Federalists between them. Yet, in practice, he did not act\r\non this principle. To the embarrassment of his Federalist friends he\r\nfailed to appoint their followers to office, making it difficult for\r\nthem to explain why he should profit by Federalist support and turn a\r\ndeaf ear to Federalist necessities; and, to the surprise of his most\r\ndevoted Republican supporters, he refused to make a clean sweep of the\r\nmen in office whom he believed to have acted against him. He quickly\r\ndropped the Tammany men holding places in New York City, and\r\noccasionally let go an up-state politician at the instance of Ambrose\r\nSpencer, but with characteristic independence he disregarded the\r\nadvice of his friends who urged him to let them all go.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a change long foreseen by those who were in the inner\r\npolitical circle was rapidly approaching. At no period of American\r\nhistory could such a man as Clinton remain long in power without\r\nformidable rivals. No sooner, therefore, had the Legislature convened,\r\nin January, 1818, than Martin Van Buren, Samuel Young, Peter R.\r\nLivingston, Erastus Root, and their associates, began open war upon\r\nhim. For a long time it had been a question whether it was to be\r\nClinton and Van Buren, or Van Buren and Clinton. Van Buren had been\r\ngrowing every day in power and influence. Seven years before Elisha\r\nWilliams had sneered at him as Little Matty. \"Poor little Matty!\" he\r\nwrote, \"what a blessing it is for one to think he is the greatest\r\nlittle fellow in the world. It would be cruel to compel this man to\r\nestimate himself correctly. Inflated with pride, flattered for his\r\npertness, caressed for his assurance, and praised for his\r\nimpertinence, it is not to be wondered that in a market where those\r\nqualifications pass for evidence of intrinsic merit he should think\r\nhimself great.\" Williams, great and brilliant as he was, could not\r\nbear with patience the supremacy which Van Buren was all too certainly\r\nobtaining. He struggled against him, intrigued against him, and\r\nfinally hated and lampooned him, but the superiority of Van Buren's\r\ntalents as a managing politician was destined to make him pre-eminent\r\nin the State and in the nation.\r\n\r\nThat Van Buren was not always honourable, the famous Fellows-Allen\r\ncontest had recently demonstrated. Henry Fellows, a Federalist\r\ncandidate for assemblyman in Ontario County, received a majority of\r\nthirty votes over Peter Allen, a Republican; but because the former's\r\nname appeared in his certificate as Hen. Fellows, the Bucktails,\r\nguided by Van Buren, seated Allen, whose vote was absolutely needed to\r\nelect a Republican Council of Appointment. Writing \"Hen.\" for Henry\r\nwas not error; it was not even an inadvertence. Van Buren knew that it\r\nstood for Henry as \"Wm.\" did for William, or \"Jas.\" for James. But Van\r\nBuren wanted the Council. It cannot be said that this action was\r\ninconsistent with the sentiment then governing the conduct of parties;\r\nfor the maxim obtained that \"everything is fair in war.\" Nevertheless,\r\nit illuminated Van Buren's character, and left the impression upon\r\nsome of his contemporaries that he was a stranger to a high standard\r\nof political morality.\r\n\r\nProbably DeWitt Clinton would have taken similar advantage. But in\r\npractical politics Clinton was no match for the Kinderhook statesman.\r\nVan Buren studied the game like a chess-player, taking knights and\r\npawns with the ease of a skilful mover. Clinton, on the other hand,\r\nwas an optimist, who believed in his destiny. In the performance of\r\nhis official duties he mastered whatever he undertook and relied upon\r\nthe people for his support; and so long as he stood for internal\r\nimprovements and needed reform in the public service, he did not rely\r\nin vain. Force, clearness and ability characterised his state papers.\r\nFor years he had been a student of municipal and county affairs; and,\r\nin suggesting new legislation, he exhibited rare judgment and absolute\r\nimpartiality. A comprehension that sound finance had much to do with\r\ndomestic prosperity, entered into his review of the financial\r\nsituation--in its relation to the construction of the canals--indicating\r\nfulness of information and great clearness as to existing conditions.\r\nClinton was honestly proud of his canal policy; more than once he\r\ndeclared, with exultation, that nothing was more certain to promote\r\nthe prosperity of the State, or to secure to it the weight and\r\nauthority, in the affairs of the nation, to which its wealth and\r\nposition entitled it. Seldom in the history of an American\r\ncommonwealth has a statesman been as prophetic. But in managing the\r\ndetails of party tactics--in dealing with individuals for the purpose\r\nof controlling the means that control men--he conducted the office of\r\ngovernor much as he did his candidacy for President in 1812, without\r\nplan, and, apparently, without organisation. With all his courage,\r\nClinton must have felt some qualms of uneasiness as one humiliation\r\nfollowed another; but if he felt he did not show them. Conscious of\r\nhis ability, and of his own great purposes, he seems to have borne his\r\nposition with a sort of proud or stolid patience.\r\n\r\nThis inattention or inability to attend to details of party management\r\nbecame painfully apparent at the opening of the Legislature in\r\nJanuary, 1818. Van Buren and his friends had agreed upon William\r\nThompson for speaker of the Assembly. Thompson was a young man, warm\r\nin his passions, strong in his prejudices, and of fair ability, who\r\nhad served two or three terms in the lower house, and who, it was\r\nthought, as he represented a western district, and, in opposition to\r\nElisha Williams, had favoured certain interests in Seneca County\r\ngrowing out of the location of a new courthouse, would have greater\r\nstrength than other more prominent Bucktails. It was known, also, that\r\nThompson had taken a violent dislike to Clinton and could be relied\r\nupon to advance any measure for the latter's undoing. To secure his\r\nnomination, therefore, Van Buren secretly notified his partisans to be\r\npresent at the caucus on the evening before the session opened.\r\n\r\nThe Clintonians had talked of putting up John Van Ness Yates, son of\r\nthe former Chief Justice, a ready talker, companionable and brilliant,\r\na gentleman of fine literary taste, with an up-and-down political\r\ncareer due largely to his consistent following of Clinton. But the\r\nGovernor now wanted a stronger, more decided man; and, after advising\r\nwith Spencer, he selected Obadiah German, for many years a leader in\r\nthe Assembly, and until recently a member of the United States Senate,\r\nwith such a record for resistance to Governor Tompkins, and active\r\ncomplicity with the Federalists who had aided his election to the\r\nAssembly, that the mere mention of his name to the Bucktails was like\r\na firebrand thrown onto the roof of a thatched cottage. German\r\nhimself doubted the wisdom of his selection. He was an old-time\r\nfighter, preferring debate on the floor to the wielding of a gavel\r\nwhile other men disputed; but the Governor, with sublime faith in\r\nGerman's fidelity and courage, and a sublimer faith in his own power\r\nto make him speaker, turned a deaf ear to the assemblyman's wishes.\r\nHad Clinton now conferred with his friends in the Legislature, or\r\nsimply urged their presence at the caucus, he might easily have\r\nnominated German in spite of his record. On the contrary, he did\r\nneither, and when the caucus met, of the seventy-five members present,\r\nforty-two voted for Thompson and thirty-three for German. When too\r\nlate Clinton discovered his mistake--seventeen Clintonians had been\r\nabsent and all the Bucktails present. The great Clinton had been\r\noutwitted!\r\n\r\nThe hearts of the Bucktails must have rejoiced when they heard the\r\ncount, especially as the refusal of the Clintonians to make the\r\nnomination unanimous indicated an intention to turn to the Federalists\r\nfor aid. This was the one error the Bucktails most desired Clinton to\r\ncommit; for it would stamp them as the regular representatives of the\r\nparty, and reduce the Clintonians to a faction, irregular in their\r\nmethods and tainted with Federalism. It is difficult to realise the\r\narguments which could persuade Clinton to take such a step. Even if\r\nsuch conduct be not considered a question of principle, and only one\r\nof expediency, he should have condemned it. Yet this is just what\r\nClinton did not do. After two days of balloting he disclosed his hand\r\nin a motion declaring Obadiah German the speaker, and sixty-seven\r\nmembers, including seventeen Federalists, voted in the affirmative,\r\nwhile forty-eight, including three Federalists, voted in the negative.\r\n\r\n\"The Assembly met on Tuesday,\" wrote John A. King to his father, on\r\nJanuary 8, 1818, \"but adjourned without choosing a speaker. The next\r\nday, after a short struggle, Mr. German was chosen by the aid of some\r\nof the Federalists. I regret to say that there are some of the Federal\r\ngentlemen and influential ones, too, who are deeply pledged to support\r\nthe wanderings fortunes of Mr. Clinton. On this point the Federal\r\nparty must, if it has not already, divide. Once separated there can be\r\nno middle course; a neutrality party in politics, if not an absurdity,\r\nat least is evidence of indecision. We are not yet declared enemies,\r\nbut if I mistake not, the question of Council and the choice of a\r\nUnited States senator must, if these gentlemen persist, decide the\r\nmatter irrevocably. Mr. W. Duer, Van Vechten, Bunner, Hoffman, and\r\nmyself are opposed to Mr. W. Van Ness, Oakley, and J. Van Rensselaer.\r\nMr. Clinton has found means to flatter these gentlemen with the\r\nprospect of attaining their utmost wishes by adhering to and\r\nsupporting his administration.\"[192]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: Charles R. King, _The Life and Correspondence of Rufus\r\nKing_, Vol. 6, p. 102.]\r\n\r\nClinton committed the second great error of his life when he consented\r\nto bolt the caucus nominee of his party. It was an act of conscious\r\nbaseness. He had not manfully put forward his strength. Instead of\r\nmanaging, he temporised; instead of meeting his adversaries with a\r\nwill, he did nothing, while they worked systematically and in silence.\r\nEven then he need not have entered the caucus; but, once having\r\nvoluntarily entered it, it was his plain duty to support its nominee.\r\nAs a question of principle or expediency Clinton's conduct, therefore,\r\nadmits of no defence. The plea that Van Buren had secretly assembled\r\nthe Bucktails in force neither justifies nor palliates it; for the\r\nslightest management on Clinton's part would have controlled the\r\ncaucus by bringing together fifty members instead of thirty-three, and\r\nthe slightest inquiry would have discovered the weakness of having\r\nonly thirty-three present instead of fifty.\r\n\r\nClinton professed to believe that the Federalists no longer existed as\r\na party; and it is probably true that he desired to create a party of\r\nhis own out of its membership, strengthened by the Clintonians, and to\r\nleave Tammany and its Bucktail supporters to build up an opposition\r\norganisation. But in this he was in advance of his time. Though the\r\nday was coming when a majority of the Clintonians and Federalists\r\nwould make the backbone of the Whig party in the Empire State, a new\r\nparty could not be built up by such methods as Clinton now introduced.\r\nNew parties, like poets, are born, not made, and a love for principle,\r\nnot a desire for spoils, must precede their birth. If Clinton had\r\nsincerely desired a new organisation, he should have disclaimed all\r\nconnection with the Republican or Federalist, and planted his standard\r\non the cornerstone of internal improvements, prepared to make the\r\nsacrifice that comes to those who are tired of existing conditions and\r\neager for new policies and new associations. But Clinton was neither\r\nreformer nor pioneer. He loved the old order of things, the Council of\r\nAppointment, the Council of Revision, the Constitution of 1777 as\r\namended by the convention of 1801, and all the machinery that gave\r\npower to the few and control to the boss. He had been born to power.\r\nFrom his first entrance into the political arena he had exercised\r\nit--first with the help of his uncle George, afterward with the\r\nassistance of his brother-in-law, Ambrose Spencer; and now that he had\r\nswung back into power again by means of his canal policy, he had no\r\ndisposition to let go any part of it by letting go the Republican\r\nparty. What Van Buren got from him he must take by votes, not by\r\ngifts.\r\n\r\nClinton's flagrant violation of the caucus rule, that a minority must\r\nyield to the majority, not only broke the Republican party into the\r\nfamous factions known as Clintonians and Bucktails; it alarmed local\r\nleaders throughout the State; made the rank and file distrustful of\r\nthe Governor's fealty, and consolidated his enemies, giving them the\r\nbest of the argument and enabling Van Buren to build up an\r\norganisation against which the Governor was ever after compelled to\r\nstruggle with varying fortune. Indeed, in the next month, Van Buren so\r\nmanaged the selection of a Council that it gave Clinton credit for\r\ncontrolling appointments without the slightest power of making them,\r\nso that the disappointed held him responsible and the fortunate gave\r\nhim no thanks. Following this humiliation, too, came the election, by\r\none majority, of Henry Seymour, a bitter opponent of Clinton, to the\r\ncanal commissionership made vacant by the resignation of Joseph\r\nEllicott. The Governor's attention had been called to the danger of\r\nhis candidate's defeat; but with optimistic assurance he dismissed it\r\nas impossible until Ephraim Hart, just before the election occurred,\r\ndiscovered that the cunning hand of Van Buren had accomplished his\r\noverthrow. \"A majority of the canal commissioners are now politically\r\nopposed to the Governor,\" declared the Albany _Argus_, \"and it will\r\nnot be necessary for a person who wishes to obtain employment on the\r\ncanal as agent, contractor or otherwise, to avow himself a\r\nClintonian.\" This exultant shout meant that in future only\r\nanti-Clintonians would make up the army of canal employees.\r\n\r\nBut a greater _coup d'état_ was to come. Van Buren understood well\r\nenough that Clinton's strength with the people was not as a politician\r\nor Republican leader, but as a stubborn, indefatigable advocate of the\r\ncanal; and that, so long as the Bucktails opposed his scheme, their\r\ncontrol of appointments could not overthrow him. Van Buren, therefore,\r\ndetermined to silence this opposition. Just how he did it is not of\r\nrecord. It was said, at the time, that a caucus was held of Clinton's\r\nopponents; but, however it was done, it must have required all Van\r\nBuren's strength of will and art of persuasion to sustain him in the\r\nmidst of so many difficulties--difficulties which were greatly\r\nincreased by the unfriendly conduct of Erastus Root, and two or three\r\nsenators from the southern district, including Peter Sharpe,\r\nafterward speaker of the Assembly. Yet the fact that he accomplished\r\nit, and with such secrecy that Clinton's friends did not know how it\r\nwas brought about, showed the quiet and complete control exercised by\r\nVan Buren over the members of the Bucktail party. The _National\r\nAdvocate_, edited by Mordecai Manesseh Noah, a conspicuous figure in\r\npolitics for forty years and one of the most unrelenting partisans of\r\nhis day, had supported Tammany in its long and bitter antagonism to\r\nthe canal with a malevolence rarely equalled in that or any other day.\r\nHe measured pens with Israel W. Clarke of the Albany _Register_, who\r\nhad so ably answered every point that Noah charged their authorship to\r\nClinton himself. But after Van Buren had spoken, the _Advocate_,\r\nsuddenly, as if by magic, changed its course, and, with the rest of\r\nthe Bucktail contingent, rallied to the support of Clinton's pet\r\nscheme with arguments as sound and full of clear good sense as the\r\nGovernor himself could wish. The people, however, had good reason to\r\nknow that statesmen were not all and always exactly as they professed\r\nto be; and the immediate effect of the Bucktail change of heart\r\namounted to little more than public notice that the canal policy was a\r\ncomplete success, and that Tammany and its friends had discovered that\r\nfurther opposition was useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nRE-ELECTION OF RUFUS KING\r\n\r\n1819-1820\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Clinton's canal policy now dominated Bucktails as well as\r\nClintonians, eliminating all differences as to public measures, the\r\nbitterness between these factions increased until the effort to elect\r\na United States senator to succeed Rufus King resulted in a complete\r\nseparation. The Clintonians had settled upon John C. Spencer, while\r\nthe Bucktails thought Samuel Young, a decided friend of Clinton's\r\ncanal policy, the most likely man to attract support. Both were\r\nrepresentative men, and either would have done honour to the State.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Spencer needed no introduction or advertisement as the son of\r\nAmbrose Spencer. He was a man of large promise. Everything he did he\r\ndid well, and he had already done much. Though scarcely thirty-four\r\nyears of age, he had established himself as a leading lawyer of the\r\nCommonwealth, whose strong, vigorous English in support of the war had\r\nfound its way into Parliament as an unanswerable argument to Lord\r\nLiverpool's unwise policy, winning him an enviable reputation as a\r\nwriter. Skilful in expression, adroit in attack, calm and resourceful\r\nin argument, with the sarcasm of the younger Pitt, he had presented\r\nAmerican rights and British outrages in a clearer light than others,\r\narousing his countrymen very much as the letters of Junius had\r\nquickened English political life forty years before. He made it plain\r\nthat England's insistence upon the right to stop and search an\r\nAmerican vessel, and England's persistent refusal to recognise a\r\nnaturalised American citizen on board an American vessel, were the\r\nreal causes of quarrel. \"There is not an individual,\" said a leading\r\nBritish journal, \"who has attended at all to the dispute with the\r\nUnited States, who does not see that it has been embittered from the\r\nfirst, and wantonly urged on by those who, for the sake of their own\r\naggrandisement, are willing to plunge their country into all the evils\r\nportrayed by the American writer.\"\r\n\r\nA single term in Congress had placed Spencer in the ranks of the\r\nleaders. He was trenchant in speech, forceful on paper, and helpful in\r\ncommittee. Intellectually, he took the place of the distinguished\r\nSouth Carolinian, just then leaving Congress to become Monroe's\r\nsecretary of war, whose thin face and firm mouth resembled the New\r\nYorker's. Spencer, like Calhoun, delighted in establishing by the\r\nsubtlest train of philosophical reasoning the delicate lines that\r\nexposed sophistry and error, and made clear the disputed point in law\r\nor in legislation. The rhetorical drapery that gave Samuel Young such\r\nsignal success found no place in Spencer's arguments or in his\r\npamphlets; but to a logic that deeply penetrated his subject he added\r\nan ethical interest which captivated the mind, as his reasoning\r\nilluminated and made plain. He was a born fighter. Like his father, he\r\nasked no quarter and he gave none. His eye had the expression one sees\r\nin hawks and game-cocks. At twenty-eight, as district attorney of the\r\nfive western counties of the State, he had become a terror to\r\nevil-doers, and it is said of him, at his old home in Canandaigua,\r\nthat men, conscious of their innocence, preferred appealing to the\r\nmercy of the court than endure prosecution at his hands. Possibly he\r\npossessed the small affections which Disraeli thought necessary to be\r\ncoupled with large brains to insure success in public life, yet his\r\nnature, in every domestic and social relation, was the gentlest and\r\nsimplest. DeWitt Clinton did not always approve Spencer's political\r\ncourse. He thought him \"an incubus on the party,\" \"the political\r\nmillstone of the west,\" and he attributed the occasional loss of\r\nOntario and neighbouring counties \"to his deleterious management.\" The\r\nausterity and haughtiness of his manner naturally lessened his\r\npopularity, just as his caustic pen and satirical tongue made him\r\nbitter enemies; but his strong will and imperious manner were no more\r\noffensive than Clinton's. Like Clinton, too, Spencer was ill at ease\r\nin a harness; he resented being lined up by a party boss. But, at the\r\ntime he was talked of for United States senator, the intelligent\r\naction and tireless industry upon which his fame rests, had so\r\nimpressed men, that they overlooked unpopular traits in their\r\nadmiration for his great ability. People did not then know that he was\r\nto sit in the Cabinet of a President, and be nominated to a place upon\r\nthe Supreme bench of the United States; but they knew he was destined\r\nto become famous, because he was already recognised as a professional\r\nand political leader.\r\n\r\nThe genius of Samuel Young had also left its track behind. He was not\r\na great lawyer, but his contemporaries thought him a great man. He\r\ncombined brilliant speaking with brilliant writing. The fragments of\r\nhis speeches that have been preserved scarcely hint at the\r\nextraordinary power accorded them in the judgment of his neighbours.\r\nIt is likely that the magic of presence, voice, and action,\r\nexaggerated their merits, since he possessed the gifts of a trained\r\norator, rivalling the forceful declamation of Erastus Root, the mellow\r\ntones and rich vocabulary of William W. Van Ness, and the smoothness\r\nof Martin Van Buren. But, if his speeches equalled his pamphlets, the\r\njudgment of his contemporaries must be accepted without limitation.\r\nChancellor Kent objected to giving joint stock companies the right to\r\nengage in privateering, a drastic measure passed by the Legislature of\r\n1814 in the interest of a more vigorous prosecution of the war; and in\r\nhis usual felicitous style, and with much learning, the stubborn\r\nFederalist pronounced the statute inconsistent with the spirit of the\r\nage and contrary to the genius of the Federal Constitution. Young\r\nreplied to the great Chancellor in a series of essays, brilliant and\r\nreadable even in a new century. He showed that, although America had\r\nbeen handicapped by Federalist opposition, by a disorganised army,\r\nand by a navy so small that it might almost as well have not existed,\r\nyet American privateers--outnumbering the British fleet, scudding\r\nbefore the wind, defying capture, running blockades, destroying\r\ncommerce, and bearing the stars and stripes to the ends of the\r\nearth--had dealt England the most staggering blow ever inflicted upon\r\nher supremacy of the sea. This was plain talk and plain truth; and it\r\nmade the speaker of the Assembly known throughout the State as \"the\r\nsword, the shield, and the ornament of his party.\" Young was as\r\ndauntless as Spencer, and, if anything, a more distinguished looking\r\nman. He was without austerity and easy of approach; and, although\r\ninclined to reticence, he seemed fond of indulging in jocular remarks\r\nand an occasional story; but he was a man of bad temper. He fretted\r\nunder opposition as much as Clinton, and he easily became vindictive\r\ntoward opponents. This kept him unpopular even among men of his own\r\nfaction. Clinton thought him \"much of an imbecile,\" and suggested in a\r\nletter to Post that \"suspicions are entertained of his integrity.\"[193]\r\nYet Young had hosts of friends eager to fight his political battles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 417.]\r\n\r\nThe Bucktails had no serious expectation either of nominating or\r\nelecting Samuel Young to the United States Senate. They knew the\r\nClintonians had a majority, and their purpose, in attending the\r\ncaucus, was simply to prevent a nomination. No sooner had the meeting\r\nassembled, therefore, than several Bucktails attacked the Governor,\r\nreproaching him for the conduct of his followers and severely\r\ncriticising his political methods and character. To this German\r\nretorted with great bitterness. German made no pretensions to the gift\r\nof oratory; he had neither grace of manner nor alluring forms of\r\nexpression. On the contrary, there was a certain quality of antagonism\r\nin his manner, as if he took grim satisfaction in letting fly his\r\nwords, seemingly almost coldly indifferent to their effect; and on\r\nthis occasion his sledge-hammer blows gave Peter R. Livingston,\r\nevidently acting by prearrangement, abundant chance for forcing a\r\nquarrel. In the confusion that followed, the caucus hastily adjourned\r\namid mutual recriminations. When too late to mend matters the\r\nClintonians discovered the trick. They had the majority and could\r\neasily have named Spencer as the candidate of the party, but in the\r\nexcitement of German's speech and Livingston's attack they lost their\r\nheads. Thus ended forever all caucus relationship between these\r\nwarring factions, and henceforth they were known as two distinct\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nAt the joint session of the Legislature, on February 2, 1819, the\r\nClintonians gave Spencer sixty-four votes, while Young received\r\nfifty-seven, and Rufus King thirty-four. \"A motion then prevailed to\r\nadjourn,\" wrote John A. King to his father, \"so that this Legislature\r\nwill make no choice.\" Young King, a member of the Assembly, was\r\nlooking after his father's re-election to the Senate. He deeply\r\nresented Clinton's control of the Federalists, because it made his\r\nfather a leader only in name; and to show his dislike of Federalist\r\nmethods he associated and voted with the Bucktails. Nor did the father\r\ndislike Clinton less than the son. Rufus King had felt, what he was\r\npleased to call \"the baleful influence of the Clintons,\" ever since\r\nhis advent into New York politics. They had opposed the Federal\r\nConstitution which he, as a delegate from Massachusetts, helped to\r\nframe; they assisted Jefferson in overwhelming Hamilton; and they\r\nbenefited by the election trick which defeated John Jay. For more than\r\ntwo decades, therefore, Rufus King had watched their control by\r\nmethods, which a man cast in a mould that would make no concessions to\r\nhis virtue, could not approve. Under his observation, DeWitt Clinton\r\nhad grown from young manhood, ambitious and domineering, accustomed to\r\ndestroy the friend who got in his way with as much ease, apparently,\r\nas he smote an enemy. Hence King regarded him much as Hamilton did\r\nAaron Burr; and against his candidacy for President in 1812, he used\r\nthe argument that the great Federalist had hurled against the\r\nintriguing New Yorker in 1801. He rejoiced that Clinton lost the\r\nmayoralty in 1815; that he was defeated for elector in 1816; and he\r\ndeeply regretted his election as governor in 1817.\r\n\r\nOn his part, Clinton had little use for Rufus King; but his need of\r\nFederalist votes made him excessively cautious about appearing to\r\noppose the distinguished Senator; although a deep-laid scheme,\r\nunderstood if not engineered by Clinton, existed to defeat him. John\r\nKing assured his father that Clinton, inviting Joseph Yates to\r\nbreakfast, urged him to become a candidate; and that William W. Van\r\nNess had asked Chancellor Kent to enter the race. \"I entertain not the\r\nslightest doubt,\" he continued, referring to Van Ness, \"of being able\r\nto produce such testimony of his hypocrisy and infidelity as will\r\nrequire more art than ever he is master of to explain or escape\r\nfrom.\"[194]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: Charles R. King, _Life and Correspondence of Rufus\r\nKing_, Vol. 6, p. 251.]\r\n\r\nAs the time approached for the reassembling of the Legislature, in\r\nJanuary, 1820, these machinations of Clinton caused his opponents many\r\nan uneasy hour. The Bucktails, who could not elect a senator of their\r\nown, would not take a Clintonian, and an alliance between Clinton and\r\nthe Federalists, led by Van Ness, Oakley, and Jacob R. Van Rensselaer,\r\nthreatened to settle the question against them. Van Buren favoured\r\nKing, although the Administration at Washington thought his election\r\nimpolitic, because of its effect upon the party in the State; but Van\r\nBuren showed great firmness. His party was violently opposed to King.\r\nVan Buren, too, was growing tired of the strain of maintaining the\r\nleadership of one faction without disrupting the other. But so sure\r\nwas he of the wisdom of King's support that he insisted upon it, even\r\nthough it sacrificed his leadership. \"We are committed to his\r\nsupport,\" he wrote. \"It is both wise and honest. Mr. King's views\r\ntoward us are honourable and correct. I will put my head on its\r\npropriety.\"[195]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: Edward M. Shepard, _Life of Van Buren_, p. 71.]\r\n\r\nVan Buren wanted to share in the division of the Federalists; and to\r\nrefuse them a United States senator, when Clinton had recently given\r\nthem an attorney-general, an influential, and, at that time, a most\r\nlucrative office, struck him as poor policy--especially since John A.\r\nKing and other estimable gentlemen had evidenced a disposition to join\r\nthem. Two weeks before the Legislature assembled, therefore, an\r\nunsigned letter, skilfully drawn, found its way into the hands of\r\nevery Bucktail, summing up the reasons why they could properly support\r\nRufus King. After recalling his Revolutionary services, this anonymous\r\nwriter declared that support of King could not subject Bucktails to\r\nthe suspicion of a political bargain, since the Senator had neither\r\nacted with the Federalists who had shown malignity against the\r\nAdministration, nor with that numerous and respectable portion who\r\nignorantly thought the war impolitic; but rather with those who aided\r\nin forcing England to respect the rights of American citizens. It was\r\na cunning letter. There was rough and rasping sarcasm for the\r\nClintonians; an ugly disregard for the radical Federalist; a kind word\r\nfor the mere party follower, and winning speech for the gifted sons\r\nwho had risen superior to inherited prejudices. The concluding\r\ndeclaration to the Bucktails was that King merited support because he\r\nand his friends opposed Governor Clinton's re-election, the assertion\r\nbeing justified by reference to John King's vote against German and\r\nthe Clinton Council.\r\n\r\nOf the authorship of this remarkable paper, there could be no doubt.\r\nWilliam L. Marcy had aided in its preparation; but the hand of Van\r\nBuren had shaped its character and inspired its winning qualities. It\r\nhad the instant effect that Van Buren plainly invoked for it--the\r\nunanimous election of Rufus King. Perhaps, on the whole, nothing in\r\nVan Buren's official life showed greater political courage or\r\ndiscernment. It is not so famous as his Sherrod Williams letter of\r\n1836, or the celebrated Texas letter with which he faced the crisis of\r\n1844, but it ranks with the public utterances of those years when he\r\ntook the risk of meeting living issues that divided men on small\r\nmargins. There was a strength and character about it that seemed to\r\nleave men powerless to answer. Clintonians objected to King, many\r\nBucktails opposed him, Van Ness declared that he could easily be\r\ndefeated, Thomas J. Oakley recognised him as the candidate of a man\r\nwho spoke of Clinton and his Federalist allies as profligates and\r\npolitical blacklegs. Yet they all voted for Rufus King. Van Buren made\r\nup their minds for them; and, though protesting against the duplicity\r\nof Bucktail, the cowardliness of Federalist, and the timidity of\r\nClintonian, each party indorsed him, while proclaiming him not its\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nBut Rufus King was not an ordinary candidate. His great experience and\r\nexalted character, coupled with his discriminating devotion to the\r\nbest interests of the country, yielded strength that no other man in\r\nthe State could command. He was now about sixty years of age, and, of\r\nliving statesmen, he had no superior. His life had been a pure one,\r\nand his public acts and purposes, measured by the virtues of\r\npatriotism, honesty and integrity, entitled him to the respect and\r\nlasting gratitude of his fellow citizens. The taste for letters which\r\ncharacterised his Harvard College days, followed him into public\r\naffairs, and if his style lacked the simplicity of Madison's and the\r\nprophetic grasp and instinctive knowledge of Hamilton, he shared their\r\nclearness of statement and breadth of view. He displayed similar\r\ncapacity in administration and in keeping abreast of the times.\r\nAlthough a lifelong member of the Federal party, whose leadership in\r\nNew York he inherited upon the death of its great founder, he\r\nsupported the War of 1812 with zeal, giving no countenance to the\r\nHartford Convention if he did not openly oppose it, and promising\r\nnothing in the way of aid that he did not amply and promptly fulfil.\r\nAt the supreme moment of the crisis, in 1814, when the general\r\ngovernment needed money and the banks would loan only upon the\r\nindorsement of the Governor, he pledged his honour to support Tompkins\r\nin whatever he did.\r\n\r\nTo the society of contemporaries, regardless of party, King was always\r\nwelcome. He disliked a quarrel. It seemed to be his effort to avoid\r\ncontroversy; and when compelled to lead, or to participate\r\nconspicuously in heated debate, he carefully abstained from giving\r\noffence. Benton bears testimony to his habitual observance of the\r\ncourtesies of life. Indeed, his urbanity made a deep impression upon\r\nall his colleagues. Yet King was not a popular man. The people thought\r\nhim an aristocrat; and, although without arrogance, his appearance and\r\nmanner gave character to their opinion. His countenance inclined to\r\nausterity, forbidding easy approach; his indisposition to talk lent an\r\nair of reserve, with the suggestion of coldness, which was unrelieved\r\nby the touch of amiability that commended John Jay to the affectionate\r\nregard of men. It was his nature to be serious and thoughtful. Among\r\nfriends he talked freely, often facetiously, becoming, at times,\r\npeculiarly instructive and fascinating, as his remarkable memory gave\r\nup with accuracy and facility the product of extensive travel, varied\r\nexperiences, close observation, and much reading. His statements,\r\nespecially those relating to historical and political details, were\r\nrarely questioned. We read that he was of somewhat portly habit, above\r\nthe middle size, strongly made, with the warm complexion of good\r\nhealth, large, attractive eyes, and a firm, full mouth; that, although\r\nmen no longer chose to be divided sharply by marked distinction of\r\nattire, he always appeared in the United States Senate in full dress,\r\nwith short clothes, silk stockings and shoes--having something of\r\npride and hauteur in his manner that was slightly offensive to plain\r\ncountry gentlemen, as well as inconsistent with the republican idea of\r\nequality. Wealthy, he lived at Jamaica, in a stately mansion,\r\nsurrounded by noble horse chestnut trees, an estate known as King\r\nPark, and kept at public expense as a typical Long Island colonial\r\nhomestead.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the extension of slavery into Missouri influenced\r\nKing's return to the United States Senate; for the election occurred\r\nin the midst of that heated contest, a contest in which he had\r\nalready taken a conspicuous part in the Fifteenth Congress, and in\r\nwhich he was destined to earn, in still greater degree, the\r\ncommendation of friends, outside and inside the Senate, as the\r\nchampion of freedom. But whatever the cause of his election, it is\r\ncertain that it was free from suspicion, other than that he preferred\r\nVan Buren to Clinton--a choice which necessarily created the\r\nimpression that King's prejudice against Clinton resulted more from\r\njealousy than from aversion to his character. No doubt Clinton's\r\nability to dominate Federalist support, in spite of King's opposition,\r\nwounded the latter's pride and created a dislike which gradually\r\ndeepened into a feeling of resentment. It had practically left him\r\nwithout a party; and he turned to Van Buren very much as Charles James\r\nFox turned to Lord North in 1782. He cheerfully accepted the most\r\nconfidential relations with the Kinderhook statesman, and when, a year\r\nor two later, Van Buren joined him in the United States Senate, Benton\r\nobserved the deferential regard paid by Van Buren to his venerable\r\ncolleague, and the marked kindness and respect returned by King. Yet\r\nKing did not openly ally himself with the Bucktails. They could rely\r\nwith certainty upon his support to antagonise Clinton, but he declined\r\nto join a party whose character and principles did not promise such\r\ncompanionship as he had been accustomed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTOMPKINS' LAST CONTEST\r\n\r\n1820\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coming of 1820 was welcomed by the Van Buren forces. It was the\r\nyear for the selection of another governor, and the Bucktails, very\r\nweary of Clinton, were anxious for a change. For all practical\r\npurposes Bucktails and Clintonians had now become two opposing\r\nparties, Van Buren's removal as attorney-general, by the Council of\r\n1819, ending all semblance of friendship and political affiliation.\r\nThis Council was known as \"Clinton's Council;\" and, profiting by the\r\nlesson learned in 1817, Clinton had made a clean sweep of the men he\r\nbelieved to have acted against him. He gave Van Buren's place to\r\nThomas J. Oakley, and Peter A. Jay, eldest son of John Jay, who had\r\nrendered valuable assistance in promoting the construction of the\r\ncanal, he made recorder of New York City, an office which Richard\r\nRiker had held since 1815. These appointments naturally subjected the\r\nGovernor to the criticism of removing Republicans to make places for\r\nFederalists. But the new officers were Clinton's friends, while Riker,\r\nat least, had been an open enemy since Jonas Platt's appointment to\r\nthe Supreme bench in 1814. Jay's appointment was also a thrust at the\r\nso-called \"high-minded\" Federalists, composed of the sons of Alexander\r\nHamilton, Rufus King, and other well known men of the party.\r\n\r\nClinton's intimates had long known his desire to get rid of Van Buren.\r\nIn his letters to Henry Post, the Kinderhook statesman is termed \"an\r\narch scoundrel,\" \"the prince of villains,\" and \"a confirmed\r\nknave;\"[196] yet Clinton put off the moment of his removal from week\r\nto week, very much as Tompkins hesitated to remove Clinton from the\r\nmayoralty; that is, not so much to save the feelings of Van Buren as\r\nto avert the hostility of James Tallmadge and John C. Spencer, both of\r\nwhom sought the office. Tallmadge had recently returned from Congress\r\nfull of honours because of his brilliant part in the great debate on\r\nthe Missouri Compromise, and he now confidently expected the\r\nappointment. The moment, therefore, the Council, at its meeting in\r\nJuly, 1819, named Oakley, Tallmadge ranged himself squarely among\r\nClinton's enemies. Van Buren had expected dismissal, and he seems to\r\nhave taken it with the outward serenity and dignity that characterised\r\nthe departure of Clinton from the mayoralty in 1815; but in\r\nconfidential communications to Rufus King, he spoke of Clinton and his\r\nfriends as \"very profligate men,\" \"politician blacklegs,\" and \"a set\r\nof desperadoes.\"[197]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 412-7, 563-71.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: Martin Van Buren to Rufus King, January 19, 1820;\r\nCharles R. King, _Life and Correspondence of Rufus King_, Vol. 6, p.\r\n252.]\r\n\r\nIn the Bucktail mind, Daniel D. Tompkins seemed the only man\r\nsufficiently popular to oppose DeWitt Clinton in the gubernatorial\r\ncontest. He was remembered as the great War Governor; and the up-state\r\nleaders, representing the old war party, thought he could rally and\r\nunite the opposing factions better than any one else. In some respects\r\nTompkins' position in 1820 was not unlike that of John A. Andrew in\r\nMassachusetts in 1870, the great war governor of the Civil War. His\r\nwell-doing in the critical days of the contest had passed into\r\nhistory, making his accomplishment a matter of pride to the State, and\r\ngiving him an assured standing. Everybody knew that he had raised\r\ntroops after enlistments had practically stopped elsewhere; that he\r\nhad bought army supplies, equipped regiments, constructed\r\nfortifications, manned forts, fitted out privateers, paid bills from\r\nfunds raised on his individual indorsement, and worked with energy\r\nwhile New England sulked. When the grotesque treaty of Ghent closed\r\nthe war, the Governor's star shone brightly in the zenith. At this\r\ntime, therefore, Daniel D. Tompkins was undoubtedly the most popular\r\nman personally that ever participated in New York politics. Hammond,\r\nthe historian, relates that a father, desiring the pardon of his son,\r\nleft the capital better pleased with Governor Tompkins, who refused\r\nit, than with Governor Clinton, who granted it. It is not easy to say\r\njust wherein lay the charm of his wonderful personality. His voice was\r\nrich and mellow; his face, prepossessing in repose, expressed sympathy\r\nand friendship; while his manner, gentle and gracious without\r\nunnaturalness, appealed to his auditor as if he of all men, was the\r\none whom the Governor wished to honour. His success, too, had been\r\nmarvellous. He had carried the State by the largest majority ever\r\ngiven to a governor up to that time; larger than Jay's triumphant\r\nmajority in 1798; larger than George Clinton's in 1801 after the\r\nelection of Jefferson and the organisation of the Republican party;\r\nlarger even than the surprising vote given Morgan Lewis in 1804, when\r\nAlexander Hamilton and the Clintons combined against Aaron Burr.\r\nTompkins' nomination for governor, therefore, was made on January 16,\r\n1820, without the slightest opposition.\r\n\r\nIt was known, at this time, that Tompkins' accounts as governor showed\r\na shortage. He had failed to take vouchers during the war, and it was\r\nthought not unlikely that he had paid for army supplies out of his own\r\nmoney, and for family supplies out of the State's money; but no one\r\nbelieved him guilty of intentional misconduct. Nevertheless, his\r\naccounts, after the comptroller had audited them, after a commission\r\nof expert accountants had sought for missing vouchers, and after\r\nfriends had made explanations, were still $120,000 short. By an act,\r\napproved April 13, 1819, the Legislature authorised the comptroller to\r\nbalance this shortage by allowing Tompkins a premium of twelve per\r\ncent. on $1,000,000, and people thought nothing more about it until\r\nTompkins presented an account, demanding a premium of twenty-five per\r\ncent., which brought the State in debt to him in the sum of $130,000.\r\n\r\nThe comptroller, overwhelmed by the extravagance of the claim,\r\nconstrued the law to limit the premium on moneys borrowed solely on\r\nTompkins' personal responsibility, and out of this a correspondence\r\nwas conducted with much asperity. Archibald McIntyre, the comptroller\r\nsince 1806, possessed the absolute confidence of the people; and when\r\nhis letters became public a suspicion that the Vice President might be\r\nwrong was quickly encouraged by the friends of Clinton. This suspicion\r\nwas increased as soon as the Legislature of 1820 got to work. It was\r\nintent on mischief. By a fusion of Clintonians and Federalists John C.\r\nSpencer became speaker of the Assembly, and to cripple Tompkins, who\r\nhad now been nominated for governor, Jedediah Miller of Schoharie\r\noffered a resolution approving the conduct of the Comptroller in\r\nsettling the accounts of the former Governor. This precipitated a\r\ndiscussion which has rarely been equalled in Albany for passion and\r\nbrilliancy. A coterie of the most skilful debaters happened to be\r\nmembers of this Assembly; and for several weeks Thomas J. Oakley, John\r\nC. Spencer, and Elisha Williams sustained the Comptroller, while\r\nErastus Root, Peter Sharpe, and others pleaded for Tompkins.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the 9th of March, a Senate committee, with Van Buren as\r\nchairman, reported that the Comptroller ought to have allowed Tompkins\r\na premium of twelve and a half per cent. on $1,000,000, leaving a\r\nbalance due the Vice President of $11,870.50. It was a strange mix-up,\r\nand the more committees examined it the worse appeared the muddle.\r\nAfter Van Buren had reported, the question arose, should the\r\nComptroller be sustained, or should the report of Van Buren's\r\ncommittee be accepted? It was a long drop from $130,000 claimed by\r\nTompkins to $11,780.50 awarded him by Van Buren, yet it was better to\r\ntake that than accept a settlement which made him a defaulter, and the\r\nSenate approved the Van Buren report. But Thomas J. Oakley, chairman\r\nof the Assembly committee to which it was referred, did not propose to\r\nlet the candidate for governor escape so easily. In an able review of\r\nthe whole question he sustained the Comptroller, maintaining that the\r\nVice President must seek relief under the law like other parties, and\r\ninstructing the Comptroller to sue for any balance due the State,\r\nunless Tompkins reimbursed it by the following August. This ended\r\nlegislation for the session.\r\n\r\nVan Buren seems to have had no concern about Tompkins' canal record.\r\nPossibly he thought the disappearance of Bucktail opposition took that\r\nissue out of the campaign; but he was greatly worked up over the\r\nunsettled accounts, and in his usual adroit manner set influences to\r\nwork to discourage Tompkins' acceptance of the nomination, and to\r\nsecure the consent of Smith Thompson, then secretary of the navy, to\r\nmake the race himself. He had little difficulty in accomplishing this\r\nend, for Thompson was not at all unwilling. But to get rid of Tompkins\r\nwas another question. \"The Republican party in this State never was\r\nbetter united,\" he wrote Smith Thompson, on January 19, 1820, three\r\ndays after Tompkins' nomination; \"they all love, honour and esteem the\r\nVice President; but such is their extreme anxiety to insure the\r\nprostration of the Junto, who have stolen into the seats of power,\r\nthat they all desire that you should be the candidate. They will\r\nsupport Tompkins to the bat's end if you refuse, or he should not\r\ndecline; but if he does, and you consent to our wishes, you will be\r\nhailed as the saviour of New York.\"[198] On the same day Van Buren\r\nalso wrote Rufus King: \"Some of our friends think it is dangerous to\r\nsupport the Vice President under existing circumstances.... A few of\r\nus have written him freely on the subject and to meet the event of his\r\nhaving left the city of Washington, I have sent a copy of our letter\r\nto Secretary Thompson, of which circumstance the Secretary is not\r\ninformed. There are many points of view in which it would be desirable\r\nto place this subject before you, but I am fully satisfied you will\r\nappreciate without further explanation. I will, therefore, only say,\r\nthat if the Vice President is with you, and upon a free discussion\r\nbetween you, the Secretary and himself, he should resolve to decline,\r\nand you can induce the Secretary to consent to our using his name, you\r\nwill do a lasting benefit to the Republican interest of this\r\nState.\"[199]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: Charles R. King, _Life and Correspondence of Rufus\r\nKing_, Vol. 6, p. 254.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: Charles R. King, _Life and Correspondence of Rufus\r\nKing_, Vol. 6, p. 252.]\r\n\r\nTo this most adroit and cunning letter Rufus King replied on the last\r\nday of the month: \"The Vice President left us to-day at noon; on his\r\nway he stopped at the Senate and we had a short conference.... I\r\nobserved as between him and Mr. Clinton my apprehension was that a\r\nmajority, possibly a large majority of Federalists would vote for Mr.\r\nClinton; adding that between the Secretary of the Navy and Mr. Clinton\r\nI was persuaded that a majority of the Federalists would prefer the\r\nSecretary.... Apologising for the frankness with which I expressed my\r\nopinion, I added that I hoped he would wait until he reached New York\r\nbefore he decided; perhaps he would think it best to delay his answer\r\nuntil he arrived in Albany; one thing I considered absolutely\r\nnecessary--that his accounts should be definitely closed before\r\nelection. He answered that he was going immediately to Albany with\r\nfour propositions which would lead to a final settlement; that he\r\nmight think it best to delay his answer to the nomination until he\r\nshould reach Albany. I said in conclusion that my earnest wish was the\r\nexclusion of Mr. Clinton, and my preference (knowing the personal\r\nsacrifice he would make in consenting to his own nomination) that the\r\ncandidate selected should be the man who, in the opinion of those most\r\ncapable to decide, will be the most likely to accomplish the\r\nwork.\"[200]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: _Ibid._, Vol. 6, p. 263.]\r\n\r\nRufus King certainly did his work well. He had abundantly discouraged\r\nhim as to the Federalists and had fully advised him as to the\r\nimportance of settling his accounts; but all to no purpose. Two days\r\nlater Thompson wrote Van Buren that the Vice President \"will stand.\"\r\nThe Kinderhook statesman, however, disinclined to give it up, asked\r\nthe Secretary in a note on the same day for authority to use his name\r\n\"if the Vice President, when he arrives here, should wish to decline.\"\r\nOn the 7th of February, John A. King wrote his father: \"Hopes are\r\nstill entertained that the Vice President's decision may yet yield to\r\nthe wishes of many of his oldest friends. Those, however, who know him\r\nbest have no such hopes. Judge Yates has said that he never refused an\r\noffer of any sort in his life.\"[201] And so it proved in this\r\ninstance. Tompkins was immovable. Like a race horse trained to\r\nrunning, he only needed to be let into the ring and given a free rein.\r\nWhen the bell sounded he was off on his fifth race for governor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: Charles R. King, _Life and Correspondence of Rufus\r\nKing_, Vol. 6, p. 267.]\r\n\r\nIf Tompkins was handicapped with a shortage and a canal record,\r\nClinton was harassed for want of a party. To conceal the meagreness of\r\nhis strength in a legislative caucus, Clinton was renominated with\r\nJohn Taylor at a meeting of the citizens of Albany. He had a following\r\nand a large one, but it was without cohesion or discipline. Men felt\r\nat liberty to withdraw without explanation and without notice. Within\r\neight months after his election as a Clintonian senator, Benjamin\r\nMooers of Plattsburg accepted the nomination for lieutenant-governor\r\non the ticket with Governor Tompkins, apparently without loss of\r\npolitical prestige, or the respect of neighbours. The administration\r\nat Washington recognised the Bucktails as the regular Republican\r\nparty, and showered offices among them, until Clinton later made it a\r\nmatter of public complaint and official investigation. Other\r\ndisintegrating influences were also at work. The \"high minded\"\r\nFederalists, in a published document signed by forty or fifty leading\r\nmen, declared the Federal party dissolved and annihilated, and\r\npronounced the Clinton party simply a personal one. To belong to it\r\nindependence must be surrendered, and to obtain office in it, one must\r\nlaud its head and bow the knee, a system of sycophancy, they said,\r\ndisgusting all \"high minded\" men. But DeWitt Clinton's strength was\r\nnot in parties nor in political management. He belonged to the great\r\nmen of his time, having no superior in New York, and, in some\r\nrespects, no equal in the country. He possessed a broader horizon, a\r\nlarger intellect, a greater moral courage, than most of his\r\ncontemporaries. It is probably true that, like a mountain, he appeared\r\nbest at a distance, but having confidence in his ability and\r\nintegrity, people easily overlooked his rough, unpopular manners. The\r\nshrewd, sagacious Yankee farmers who were filling up the great western\r\ncounties of Ontario and Genesee believed in him. The Bucktails did not\r\nknow, until the eastern and western districts responded with five\r\nthousand eight hundred and four majority for Clinton, as against four\r\nthousand three hundred and seventy-seven for Tompkins in the middle\r\nand southern districts, what a capital cry Clinton had in the canal\r\nissue; what a powerful appeal to selfish interests he could put into\r\nvoice; and what a loud reply selfish interests would make to the\r\nappeal. It was not, in fact, a race between parties at all; it was not\r\na question of shortage or settlement. It is likely the shortage\r\naffected the result somewhat; but the majority of over fourteen\r\nhundred meant approval of Clinton and his canal policy rather than\r\ndistrust of Tompkins and his unsettled accounts. The question in 1820\r\nwas, shall the canal be built? and, although the Bucktails had ceased\r\ntheir hostility, the people most interested in the canal's\r\nconstruction wanted Clinton to complete what he had so gloriously and\r\nsuccessfully begun.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was fought out with bitterness and desperation until the\r\npolls closed. No national or state issue divided the parties. In fact,\r\nthere were no issues. It was simply a question whether Clinton and his\r\nfriends, or Tompkins and the Bucktails should control the state\r\ngovernment. The arguments, therefore, were purely personal. Clinton's\r\nfriends relied upon his canal policy, his honesty, and his\r\nintegrity--the Bucktails insisted that Clinton was no longer a\r\nRepublican; that the canal would be constructed as well without him\r\nas with him, and that his defeat would wipe out factional strife and\r\ngive New York greater prominence in the councils of the party. \"For\r\nthe last ten days,\" wrote Van Buren to Rufus King, on April 13, \"I\r\nhave scarcely had time to take my regular meals and am at this moment\r\npressed by at least half a dozen unfinished concerns growing out of\r\nthis intolerable political struggle in which we are involved.\"[202]\r\nNevertheless, he had no doubt of Tompkins' election. \"I entertain the\r\nstrongest convictions that we shall succeed,\"[203] he wrote later in\r\nthe month. On the other hand, Clinton was no less certain. In his\r\nletters to Henry Post he is always confident; but at no time more so\r\nthan now. \"The canal proceeds wondrously well,\" he says. \"The Martling\r\nopposition has ruined them forever. The public mind was never in a\r\nbetter train for useful operations. John Townsend has just come from\r\nthe west. There is but one sentiment.\"[204] Yet, when the battle\r\nended, it looked like a Clintonian defeat and Bucktail victory; for\r\nthe latter had swept the Legislature, adding to their control in the\r\nSenate and capturing the Assembly by a majority of eighteen over all.\r\nIt was only the presence of Tompkins among the slain that transferred\r\nthe real glory to Clinton, whose majority was fourteen hundred and\r\nfifty-seven in a total vote of ninety-three thousand four hundred and\r\nthirty-seven. This exceeded any former aggregate by nearly ten\r\nthousand.[205]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: Charles R. King, _Life and Correspondence of Rufus\r\nKing_, Vol. 6, p. 331.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: _Ibid._, Vol. 6, p. 332.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: DeWitt Clinton to Henry Post, in _Harper's Magazine_,\r\nVol. 50, p. 413.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: DeWitt Clinton, 47,444; Daniel D. Tompkins,\r\n45,990.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nDaniel D. Tompkins took his defeat much to heart. He believed his\r\nunsettled accounts had occasioned whispered slanders that crushed him.\r\nAfter his angry controversy with Comptroller McIntyre, in the\r\npreceding year, he seriously considered the propriety of resigning as\r\nVice President; for he sincerely believed his figures were right and\r\nthat the Comptroller's language had classed him in the public mind\r\nwith what, in these latter days, would be called \"grafters.\" \"Our\r\nfriend on Staten Island is unfortunately sick in body and mind,\"\r\nClinton wrote to Post in September, 1819. \"His situation upon the\r\nwhole is deplorable and calculated to excite sympathy.\"[206] It was,\r\nindeed, a most unfortunate affair, for the State discovered, years\r\nafter it was too late, that it did owe the War Governor ninety-two\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 413.]\r\n\r\nTompkins' public life continued four years longer. In the autumn of\r\n1820, the Legislature balanced his accounts and the country re-elected\r\nhim Vice President. The next year his party made him a delegate to the\r\nconstitutional convention, and the convention made him its president;\r\nbut he never recovered from the chagrin and mortification of his\r\ndefeat for the governorship. Soon after the election, melancholy\r\naccounts appeared of the havoc wrought upon a frame once so full of\r\nanimal spirits. He began to drink too freely even for those days of\r\ndeep drink. His eye lost its lustre; deep lines furrowed the round,\r\nsunny face; the unruffled temper became irritable; and, within three\r\nmonths after the close of his second term as Vice President, before he\r\nhad entered his fifty-second year, he was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE ALBANY REGENCY\r\n\r\n1820-1822\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature assembled to appoint presidential electors in\r\nNovember, 1820, Bucktail fear of Clinton was at an end for the\r\npresent. Before, his name had been one to conjure with; thenceforth it\r\nwas to have no terrors. He had, indeed, been re-elected governor, but\r\nthe small majority, scarcely exceeding one per cent. of the total\r\nvote, showed that he was now merely an independent, and a very\r\nindependent member, of the Republican party. To the close of his\r\ncareer he was certain to be a commanding figure, around whom all party\r\ndissenters would quickly and easily rally; but it was now an\r\nindividual figure, almost an eccentric figure, whose work as a\r\npolitical factor seemed to be closed.\r\n\r\nYet Clinton was not ready to go into a second retirement. On the\r\ntheory, as he wrote Henry Post, that \"the meekness of Quakerism will\r\ndo in religion, but not in politics,\"[207] he looked about him for\r\nsomething to arouse public attention and to excite public indignation,\r\nand, for the want of a better subject, he charged the Monroe\r\nadministration with interference in the recent state election. Post\r\nadvised caution; but Clinton, stung by the defeat of his friends and\r\nby his own narrow escape, had become possessed with the suspicion that\r\nfederal officials had used the patronage of the government against\r\nhim. So, in his speech to the Legislature in November, he protested\r\nagainst the outrage. \"If the officers under the appointment of the\r\nfederal government,\" he declared, \"shall see fit as an organised and\r\ndisciplined corps to interfere in state elections, I trust there will\r\nbe found a becoming disposition in the people to resist these alarming\r\nattempts upon the purity and independence of their local\r\ngovernments.\"[208] Clinton had no evidence upon which to support this\r\ncharge. It was, at best, only a suspicion based upon his own methods;\r\nbut the Senate demanded proof, and failing to get specifications, it\r\ndeclared it \"highly improper that the Chief Magistrate of the State\r\nshould incriminate the administration of the general government,\r\nwithout ample testimony in his possession.\" The resolutions closed\r\nwith an expression of confidence in the patriotism and integrity of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 413.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: _Governors' Speeches_, November 7, 1820, p. 179.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Clinton was urging Post to help him out of his difficulty.\r\n\"I want authenticated testimony of the interference of the general\r\ngovernment in our elections,\" he wrote on November 19. \"Our friends\r\nmust be up and doing on this subject. It is all important.\"[209] Eight\r\ndays later he stirred up Post again. \"What is the annual amount of\r\npatronage of the national government in this State?\" he asked.[210]\r\n\"Knowing the accuracy of your calculations, I rely much on you.\" Then\r\nhe developed his plan: \"The course of exposition ought, I think, to be\r\nthis--to collect a voluminous mass of documents detailing facts, and\r\nto form from them a lucid, intelligible statement. On the\r\nrepresentation of facts recourse must also be had to inferences, and\r\nit ought also to unite boldness and prudence.\"[211] It is evident that\r\nthus far inferences outnumbered facts, for far into December Clinton\r\nwas still calling upon his friends to collect testimony. \"Go on with\r\nyour collection of proofs,\" he wrote. \"I think with a little industry\r\nthis matter will stand well.\"[212]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 413.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: _Ibid._, Vol. 50, p. 413.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: _Ibid._, Vol. 50, p. 414.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: _Ibid._, Vol. 50, p. 415.]\r\n\r\nWhen submitted to the Legislature, on January 17, 1821, the documents,\r\naccording to the Governor's instructions, were indeed very voluminous.\r\nIt required a bag to take them to the capitol--the green bag message,\r\nit was called; but it proved to be smoke, with little fire. It fully\r\nestablished that the naval storekeeper at Brooklyn, and other federal\r\nofficials were offensive partisans, just as they had been under\r\nClinton's control, and just as they have been ever since. The\r\nBucktails saw distinctly enough that the State could not be aroused\r\ninto indignation by such a mass of documents; but there was one letter\r\nfrom Van Buren to Henry Meigs, the congressman, dated April 5, 1820,\r\nadvising the removal of postmasters at Bath, Little Falls, and Oxford,\r\nbecause it seemed impossible to secure the free circulation of\r\nBucktail newspapers in the interior of the State, which provoked much\r\ncriticism. How the Governor got it does not appear, but it gives a\r\nglimpse of Van Buren's political methods that is interesting. \"Unless\r\nwe can alarm them (the Clintonians) by two or three prompt removals,\"\r\nhe says, \"there is no limiting the injurious consequences that may\r\nresult from it.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after, two of the postmasters were removed. If the charge was\r\ntrue, that postmasters were preventing the circulation of Bucktail\r\nnewspapers, Van Buren's course was very charitable. Evidently he did\r\nnot want places for his friends so much as a proper delivery of the\r\nmails; for otherwise he would have insisted upon the removal of all\r\noffenders. The gentle suggestion that the removal of two or three\r\nwould be a warning to others, explains how this devout lover of men\r\nlived through a long life on most intimate terms with his neighbours.\r\nIf such conditions existed under the modern management of the\r\nPost-Office Department, every wrong-doer would be summarily dismissed,\r\nregardless of party or creed. Van Buren's methods had no such drastic\r\ndiscipline; yet his letter became the subject of much animadversion by\r\nthe Clintonians, not so much because they disapproved the suggestion\r\nas because Van Buren wrote it. \"It is very important to destroy this\r\nprince of villains,\" Clinton declared, in a letter to Post of December\r\n2, 1820.[213]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 415.\r\n\r\nClearly discerning Van Buren as his most formidable competitor for\r\npolitical leadership, Clinton's letters to Post from 1817 to 1824\r\nabound in vituperative allusions, as, for example: \"Whom shall we\r\nappoint to defeat the arch scoundrel Van Buren?\" November 30, 1820.\r\n\"Of his cowardice there can be no doubt. He is lowering daily in\r\npublic opinion, and is emphatically a corrupt scoundrel,\" August 30,\r\n1820. \"Van Buren is now excessively hated out of the State as well as\r\nin it. There is no doubt of a corrupt sale of the vote of the State,\r\nalthough it cannot be proved in a court of justice,\" August 6, 1824.\r\n\"We can place no reliance upon the goodwill of Van Buren. In his\r\npolitics he is a confirmed knave.\" And again: \"With respect to Van\r\nBuren, there is no developing the man. He is a scoundrel of the first\r\nmagnitude, ... without any fixture of principle or really of virtue.\"\r\n\"Van Buren must be conquered through his fears. He has no heart, no\r\nsincerity.\"]\r\n\r\nLike many other brilliant political leaders, Van Buren was somewhat\r\nthin-skinned; he happened, too, to be out of the State Senate, and\r\nthus was compelled to endure, in silence, the attacks of the\r\nopposition. It is believed that at this time, Van Buren had a strong\r\ninclination to accept a Supreme Court judgeship, and thus withdraw\r\nforever from political life. But the fates denied him any chance of\r\nmaking this serious anti-climax in his great political career. While\r\nthe green bag message convulsed the Clintonians with simulated\r\nindignation, the Bucktails declared him, by a caucus vote of\r\nfifty-eight to twenty-four, their choice for United States senator in\r\nplace of Nathan Sanford, whose term expired on March 4, 1821.\r\n\r\nIt appeared then as it appears now, that Martin Van Buren was \"the\r\ninevitable man.\" He was thirty-nine years of age, in the early\r\nripeness of his powers, a leader at the bar, and the leader of his\r\nparty. He had accumulated from his practice the beginnings of the\r\nfortune which his Dutch thrift and cautious habits made ample for his\r\nneeds. The simple and natural rules governing his astute political\r\nleadership seemed to leave him without a rival, or, at least, without\r\nan opponent who could get in his way. Times had changed, too, since\r\nthe days when United States senators resigned to become postmasters\r\nand mayors of New York. A seat in the United States Senate had become\r\na great honour, because it was a place of great power and great\r\ninfluence; and in passing from Albany to Washington Van Buren would\r\nadd to state leadership an opportunity of becoming a national figure.\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that Clinton sought to defeat him;\r\nfor he had ever been ready to retaliate upon men who ventured to cross\r\nhis purposes. But Clinton's scheme had no place in the plans of\r\nBucktails. \"I am afraid Van Buren will beat Sanford for senator,\" he\r\nwrote Post as early as the 30th of December, 1820. \"He will unless his\r\nfriends stand out against a caucus decision.\"[214] This is what\r\nClinton wanted the twenty-four Sanford delegates to do, and, to\r\nencourage such a bolt, he compelled every Federalist and Clintonian,\r\nsave one, to vote for him, although Sanford represented Tammany and\r\nits bitter hostility to Clinton. But the Bucktails had at last\r\nestablished a party organisation that could not be divided by Clinton\r\nintrigue, and Van Buren received the full party vote.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 414.]\r\n\r\nWhen Roger Skinner and his three associates on the new Council of\r\nAppointment got to work, Clinton quickly discovered that he could\r\nexpect little from such a body of Bucktails; and he received less than\r\nhe expected. For, when the Council had finished, only one Clintonian\r\nremained in office. Oakley, the able attorney-general; Jay, the gifted\r\nrecorder of New York; Colden, the acceptable mayor of New York;\r\nHawley, the ideal superintendent of common schools; Solomon Van\r\nRensselaer, the famous and fearless adjutant-general; McIntyre, the\r\ntrusted and competent comptroller, had all disappeared in a night.\r\nOnly Simeon DeWitt, who had been surveyor-general for forty years, was\r\nleft undisturbed. Former Councils had been radical and vigorous in\r\ntheir action, but the Skinner council cut as deep and swift as the\r\nfamous Clinton Council of 1801. At its first meeting, clerks and\r\nsheriffs and surrogates and district attorneys fell in windrows. Yet\r\nit was no worse than its predecessors; it could not be worse, since\r\nprecedents existed in support of conduct however scandalous.\r\n\r\nThe removal of Hawley, McIntyre, and Van Rensselaer produced a greater\r\nsensation throughout the State than any previous dismissals, except\r\nthat of DeWitt Clinton from the mayoralty in 1815. Gideon Hawley had\r\nheld the office of school superintendent for nine years, organising\r\nthe State into school districts, distributing the school fund\r\nequitably, and perfecting the work, so that the entire system could be\r\neasily handled by a superintendent. In 1818, he reported five thousand\r\nschools thus organised, with upward of two hundred thousand pupils in\r\nattendance for a period of four to six months each year. He did this\r\nwork on a salary of three hundred dollars--only to receive, at last,\r\nin place of thanks so richly deserved, the unmerited rebuke of a\r\nsummary dismissal.\r\n\r\nThe removal of Archibald McIntyre made a sensation almost as great.\r\nFor fifteen years, McIntyre had been such an acceptable comptroller\r\nthat the waves of factional and party strife had broken at his feet,\r\nleaving him master of the State's finances. The Lewisites retained him\r\nin 1807; the Federalists kept him in 1809; the Republicans continued\r\nhim in 1811; the Federalists again spared him in 1813; while the\r\nfrequent changes that followed Clinton's downfall left him\r\nundisturbed. He took no part in political contests. It was his duty to\r\nsee that the State's money was paid according to law, and he so\r\nconducted the office; but the Bucktails deeply resented his treatment\r\nof the Vice President, and a swift removal was the penalty. In some\r\ndegree McIntyre may have been responsible for the defeat of Tompkins.\r\nThe perfervid strength of his convictions as to the injustice of the\r\nVice President's claim betrayed him into an intemperance of language\r\nthat suggests over-zeal in a public official. In refusing, too, to\r\nbalance the Vice President's accounts, as the Legislature clearly\r\nintended, and as he might have done regardless of the Vice President's\r\nadditional claim, he seems to have assumed an unnecessary\r\nresponsibility, and to have learned what many men have experienced in\r\npublic life, that nothing is so dangerous as being too faithful. But\r\nMcIntyre may have had no reason to regret his removal. He was\r\nimmediately returned to the Legislature as a senator, and the next\r\nyear appointed agent for the state lotteries, a business that enabled\r\nhim in a few years to retire with an independent fortune.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to introduce here a full list of the new\r\noffice-holders; but there came into notice at this time three young\r\nlawyers who subsequently occupied a conspicuous place in the history\r\nof their State and country. Samuel A. Talcott took the place of Thomas\r\nJ. Oakley as attorney-general; William L. Marcy became adjutant-general\r\nin place of Van Rensselaer, and Benjamin F. Butler was appointed\r\ndistrict attorney of Albany County. Marcy was then thirty-five years\r\nof age, Talcott thirty-two, and Butler twenty-six. Talcott was tall\r\nand commanding, with high forehead and large mellow blue eyes that\r\ninspired confidence and admiration. His manners combined dignity and\r\nease; and as he swept along the street, or stood before judge or jury,\r\nhe appeared like nature's nobleman. Marcy had a bold, full forehead,\r\nwith heavy brows and eyes deep set and expressive. It was decidedly a\r\nWebsterian head, though the large, firm mouth and admirably moulded\r\nchin rather recalled those of Henry Clay. The face would have been\r\naustere, forbidding easy approach, except for the good-natured twinkle\r\nin the eye and a quiet smile lingering about the mouth. Marcy was\r\nabove the ordinary height, with square, powerful shoulders, and\r\ncarried some superfluous flesh as he grew older; but, at the time of\r\nwhich we are writing, he was as erect as the day he captured St.\r\nRegis. Butler was slighter than Marcy, and shorter than Talcott, but\r\nmuch larger than Van Buren, with fulness of form and perfect\r\nproportions. He had an indescribable refinement of face which seemed\r\nto come from the softness of the eye and the tenderness and\r\nintellectuality of the mouth, which reflected his gentle and generous\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Talcott's appointment, though he had not distinguished\r\nhimself as a legal competitor of Van Buren, he displayed the gentle\r\nmanners and amiable traits that naturally commended him to one of Van\r\nBuren's smooth, adroit methods. The Kinderhook statesman had, however,\r\nin selecting him for attorney-general, looked beyond the charming\r\npersonality to the rapidly developing powers of the lawyer, who was\r\neven then captivating all hearers by the strength of his arguments and\r\nthe splendour of his diction. Contemporaries of Talcott were fond of\r\ntelling of this remarkable, almost phenomenal gift of speech. One of\r\nthem mentions \"those magical transitions from the subtlest argument to\r\nthe deepest pathos;\" another describes him as \"overpowering in the\r\nweight of his intellect, who produced in the minds of his audience all\r\nthe sympathy and emotion of which the mind is capable.\" William H.\r\nDillingham, a classmate and lifelong friend, declared that the\r\nextraordinary qualities which marked his career and so greatly\r\ndistinguished him in after life--towering genius, astonishing facility\r\nin acquiring knowledge, and surpassing eloquence, were developed\r\nduring his college days. The life of Talcott recalls, in its brilliant\r\nactivity, the dazzling legal career of Alexander Hamilton. Wherever\r\nthe greatest lawyers gathered he was in their midst, the \"Erskine of\r\nthe bar.\" At his last appearance in the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates he opposed Daniel Webster in the \"Sailors' Snug Harbor\" case.\r\n\"Beginning in a low and measured tone,\" says Bacon, in his _Early Bar\r\nof Oneida County_, \"he gathered strength and power as he proceeded in\r\nhis masterly discourse, and for five hours held the breathless\r\nattention of bench and bar and audience, in an argument which the\r\nillustrious Marshall declared had not been equalled in that court\r\nsince the days of the renowned William Pinckney.\"\r\n\r\nBenjamin F. Butler was very much like Talcott in gentleness of manner\r\nand in power of intellect. He was born in Kinderhook, Columbia County,\r\nwhere his father, starting as a mechanic, became a merchant, and,\r\nafter a brief service in the Legislature, received the appointment of\r\ncounty judge. But there was no more reason to expect Medad Butler to\r\nbring an illustrious son into the world than there was that his\r\nneighbour, Abraham Van Buren, should be the father of the eighth\r\nPresident of the United States. Thirteen years divided the ages of Van\r\nBuren and Butler; and, while the latter attended the district school\r\nand aided his father about the store, Van Buren was practising law and\r\ntalking politics with Butler's father. Young Butler was not a dreamer.\r\nHe had no wild ambition to be great, and cherished no thought of\r\nsitting in cabinets or controlling the policy of a great party; but\r\nhis quiet, respectful manners and remarkable acuteness of mind\r\nattracted Van Buren. When Van Buren went to Hudson as surrogate of the\r\ncounty, Butler entered the Hudson academy. There he distinguished\r\nhimself, as he had already distinguished himself in the little\r\ndistrict school, acquiring a decided fondness for the classics. His\r\nteachers predicted for him a brilliant college career; but, whatever\r\nhis reasons, he gave up the college, and, at the age of sixteen,\r\nentered Van Buren's law office and Van Buren's family. On his\r\nadmission to the bar, in 1817, he became Van Buren's partner at\r\nAlbany.\r\n\r\nThough Talcott began life a Federalist, in the party breakup he joined\r\nthe Bucktails, with Butler and Van Buren. It seemed to be a love\r\nmatch--the relations between Talcott and Butler. They were frequently\r\nassociated in the most important cases, the possession of scholarly\r\ntastes being the powerful magnet that drew them together. Talcott, at\r\nWilliams College, had evidenced an astonishing facility for acquiring\r\nknowledge; Butler, after leaving the academy, had continued the study\r\nof the languages until he could read his favourite authors in the\r\noriginal with great ease. This was their delight. Neither of them took\r\nnaturally to public service, though offices seemed to seek them at\r\nevery turn of the road--United States senator, judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt, and seats in the cabinets of three Presidents. Nevertheless,\r\nwith the exception of a brief service under Jackson and Van Buren,\r\nButler declined all the flattering offers that came to him.\r\n\r\nIt was Marcy who seemed born for a politician. A staid old Federalist\r\nteacher sent him away from school at fourteen years of age, because of\r\nhis love for Jeffersonian principles and his fondness for argument.\r\nThe early years of this Massachusetts lad seem to have been strangely\r\nvaried and vexed. He was the leader of a band of noisy, roguish boys\r\nwho made the schoolroom uncomfortable for the teacher, and the\r\nneighbourhood uncomfortable for the parents. Neither the father nor\r\nhis wife appear to have had any idea of their good fortune. Mrs. Marcy\r\nonce declared him the worst boy in the country. He showed little\r\ndisposition to study and less inclination to work; yet it was noticed\r\nthat he read all the books to be found in the homes of his playfellows\r\nand in the libraries of the district. The character of the books made\r\nno difference; he preferred reading anything to reading nothing,\r\nthough history and general literature, such as the works of Addison,\r\non whose style he seems to have moulded his own, were his favourite\r\nvolumes. When, at last, he met Salem Towne, his earliest, and, in a\r\nsense, his best education began. Towne recognised the latent genius of\r\nthe lad and told him of it, encouraging him to enter college and the\r\nlaw. Marcy used often to declare, in later years, that he owed\r\neverything he ever gained in life to the influence and example of\r\nSalem Towne. The affectionate regard which Marcy felt for his boyhood\r\nfriend, a regard which endured until the day of his death, belongs to\r\nthe chapter of pathetic incidents in Marcy's life.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving Brown University, Marcy settled in Troy and became\r\nviolently hostile to DeWitt Clinton. After Clinton's downfall, he was\r\nappointed recorder of Troy; and after Clinton's restoration, he was\r\npromptly removed. Just now he was trying to practise law, and to edit\r\nthe Troy _Budget_, a Bucktail newspaper; but he preferred to read,\r\nsitting with his unblacked boots on the table, careless of his dress,\r\nand indifferent to his personal appearance. He looked dull and\r\ninactive, and people thought he lacked the industry and energy so\r\nnecessary to success in any profession; but when the _Budget_\r\nappeared, its editorials made men read and reflect. It was the skill\r\nwith which he marshalled facts in a gentle and winning style that\r\nattracted Van Buren and made them friends.\r\n\r\nMarcy's appointment as adjutant-general created intense indignation,\r\nbecause he took the place of Solomon Van Rensselaer, who had served in\r\nthe War of 1812, bravely leading the attack on Queenstown Heights and\r\nholding his ground until dislodged by superior force; but, it was said\r\nin reply, that Marcy had the honour of capturing the first British\r\nfort and the first British flag of the war. The fight was not a bloody\r\nencounter like the Queenstown engagement; yet, for men new to war, it\r\nevidenced coolness and great courage. A detachment of British soldiers\r\nhad taken a position at St. Regis, seven miles from the American camp.\r\nSelecting one hundred and seventy picked men, Lieutenant Marcy\r\ncautiously approached the fort at night, overpowered the guards on the\r\noutposts, surprised the sentries at the entrance, broke down the\r\ngates, and charged the enemy in the face of a volley of musketry. When\r\nit was over he had the fort, a file of prisoners, several stands of\r\narms, and a flag. Van Buren thought this record was good enough.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Talcott, Marcy, and Butler changed the existing\r\npolitical system. Prior to their activity, the distribution of\r\npatronage depended largely upon the local boss. His needs determined\r\nthe men who, regardless of their personal fitness, should be given\r\noffice. But Talcott and his colleagues introduced new methods, with a\r\nhigher standard of political morality, and a better system of party\r\ndiscipline. They refused to tolerate unworthy men, and when the little\r\nsouls stormed and raged, their wise counsels silenced the selfish and\r\nstaggered the boss. Gradually, their control of patronage and of the\r\nparty's policy became so absolute that they were called the \"Albany\r\nRegency.\" It was, at first, simply a name given them by Thurlow\r\nWeed;[215] there was neither organisation nor legal authority. Power\r\ncame from their great ability and high purpose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n36.]\r\n\r\nThe Albany Regency was destined to continue many years, and to number\r\namong its members men of character and great influence. Roger Skinner,\r\na United States district judge, was an early member of it; so were\r\nEdwin Croswell of the Albany _Argus_, and Benjamin Knower, the state\r\ntreasurer. At a later day came John A. Dix, Azariah C. Flagg, Silas\r\nWright, and Charles E. Dudley. In his autobiography, Thurlow Weed says\r\nhe \"had never known a body of men who possessed so much power and used\r\nit so well.\" They had, he continues, \"great ability, great industry,\r\nindomitable courage, and strict personal integrity.\"[216] But the men\r\nwho organised the Regency, giving it power and the respect of the\r\npeople, by refusing to do what their fine sense of honour did not\r\napprove, were Talcott, Marcy, and Butler. It was as remarkable a trio\r\nas ever sat about a table.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 1, p. 103.]\r\n\r\nIn the passing of these three great intellects, there is something\r\npeculiarly touching. Talcott died suddenly at the early age of\r\nforty-five, leaving the members of the New York bar as sincere\r\nmourners. Butler, after the highest and purest living, died at\r\nfifty-nine, just as he landed in France to visit the scenes of which\r\nhe had read and dreamed. Marcy, at sixty-two, having recently retired\r\nas President Pierce's secretary of state, was found lifeless, lying\r\nupon his bed, book in hand. He had been reading, as he had read since\r\nchildhood, whenever there came a lull in the demand for his wisdom,\r\nhis counsel, and his friendship.[217]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: \"Always an honoured citizen of New York, it has seemed\r\nfitting that the highest mountain-peak in the State by bearing his\r\nname should serve as a monument to his memory.\"--James F. Rhodes,\r\n_History of the United States_, Vol. 1, p. 247.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION\r\n\r\n1821\r\n\r\n\r\nNew England people, passing through the Mohawk Valley into the rich\r\ncountry beyond Seneca Lake, found many reasons for settling in central\r\nand western New York. Out of this section the Legislature organised\r\ntwelve new counties in 1812. The sixteen counties that existed in the\r\nState, in 1790, had increased to fifty-five in 1820. Settlers had\r\nrapidly filled up the whole region. New York City, according to the\r\nthird census, had 123,706 inhabitants, and, of these, only 5390 were\r\nunnaturalised foreigners. Indeed, the population of the State, in\r\n1820, was made up largely of native Americans; and the descendants of\r\nEnglish families outnumbered those of the Dutch.\r\n\r\nAdministrative reform had not, however, kept pace with the increase in\r\npopulation. The number of freeholders qualified to vote for senator\r\nand governor, was, relatively, no larger; the power of the Council of\r\nAppointment had become odious; the veto of the Council of Revision\r\ndistasteful; and the sittings of the Supreme Court infrequent. It was\r\nsaid that the members of the Council of Revision, secure from removal,\r\nhad resisted the creation of additional judges, until the speedy\r\nadministration of justice was a lost art. Gradually, the spirit that\r\ndemanded independence, in 1776, began to insist upon a broader\r\nsuffrage and additional rights. The New Englanders in the central,\r\nwestern, and northern parts of the State had very pronounced\r\nsentiments upon the subject of reform. They sympathised little with\r\nthe views of the landowning and conservative classes that largely\r\ncontrolled the making of the Constitution of 1777. The people of New\r\nYork City, as well, who had increased over fifty per cent. in twelve\r\nyears, clamoured for a radical change in conditions that seemed to\r\nthem to have no application to life in a republic.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the politicians were slow in recognising the necessity\r\nof amending the State Constitution. Although trouble increased from\r\nyear to year, governors avoided recommendations; and legislators\r\nhesitated to put in motion the machinery for correcting abuses. After\r\nClinton had defeated Tompkins for governor, in 1820, however, the\r\nagitation suddenly blazed into a flame. Tammany resolved in favour of\r\na convention having unlimited powers to amend the Constitution.\r\nFollowing this suggestion, Governor Clinton, in his speech to the\r\nLegislature in November, 1820, recommended that the question be\r\nsubmitted to the people. But the Bucktails, indifferent to the views\r\nof their opponents, pushed through a bill calling for a convention\r\nwith unlimited powers, whose work should subsequently be submitted in\r\ngross to the people for ratification or rejection.\r\n\r\nGovernor Clinton preferred a convention of limited powers, a\r\nconvention that could not abolish the judiciary or turn out of office\r\nthe only friends left him. Nevertheless, it was not easy for a\r\ngovernor, who loved popularity, to take a position against the\r\nBucktail bill; for the popular mind, if it had not yet formally\r\nexpressed itself on the subject, was well understood to favour a\r\nconvention. When, therefore, the bill came before the Council of\r\nRevision, Clinton thought he had taken good care to have a majority\r\npresent to disapprove it, without his assistance. Van Ness and Platt\r\nwere absent holding court; but, of the others, Joseph C. Yates, the\r\nonly Bucktail on the bench, was presumably the only one likely to\r\nfavour it. Chancellor Kent, in giving his reasons for disapproving the\r\nmeasure, contended that the Legislature had no constitutional\r\nauthority to create a convention of unlimited powers, and, if it did,\r\nit should require the convention to submit its amendments to the\r\npeople separately and not in gross. Spencer agreed with the\r\nChancellor. Yates, as expected, approved the bill, but there was\r\nconsternation in the Council when Woodworth agreed with Yates.\r\nWoodworth was the creature of Clinton. He had made him a judge, and,\r\nhaving done so, the Governor relied with confidence upon his support,\r\nin preference to that of either Van Ness or Jonas Platt. It recalls\r\nthe mistake of the historic conclave which elected a Pope whom the\r\ncardinals believed too feeble to have any will of his own, but who\r\nsuddenly became their master. One can easily understand Clinton's\r\ndilemma. He wanted the bill disapproved without his aid; Woodworth's\r\naction compelled him to do the very thing he had planned to avoid. To\r\nthe day of his death, Clinton never got over the affront. \"Yates and\r\nWoodworth were both frightened and have damned themselves,\" he wrote\r\nHenry Post, on the 27th of November, 1820. \"The latter supposed also\r\nthat he would distinguish himself by his independence. I don't know a\r\nfellow more intrinsically despicable. I intend the first convenient\r\nopportunity to cut him to the quick. Y---- is a miserable fellow--the\r\ndupe of his own vanity and the tool of bad principles!\"[218]\r\nWoodworth's action was severely criticised; and when, shortly\r\nafterward, the Bucktails in the Senate sitting as a Court of Errors,\r\nreversed a judgment against him for several thousand dollars,\r\noverruling the opinion of Chancellor Kent, it seemed to impeach the\r\npurity of his motives.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 415.]\r\n\r\nAfter Clinton had voted in the Council, the convention bill, thus\r\nvetoed, did not get the necessary two-thirds support. At the regular\r\nsession of the Legislature, which began in January, 1821, an amendment\r\nwas accepted submitting to the people the simple question of a\r\nconvention or no convention. Of the one hundred and forty-four\r\nthousand votes cast, one hundred and nine thousand favoured a\r\nconvention. Delegates were then elected; and the convention, having\r\nbeen organised, continued in session from August 28 to November 10,\r\n1821.\r\n\r\nThis convention passed into history as a remarkable gathering of\r\ndistinguished persons. With a few exceptions, all the men then living,\r\nwhose names have figured in these pages, took an active part in its\r\ndeliberations; and by their eloquence and ability contributed to a\r\nconstitution which was to answer the purposes of a rapidly growing\r\nState for another quarter of a century. John Jay, the constitution-maker\r\nof 1777, then seventy-six years of age, who still lived upon his farm,\r\nhappy in his rustic tastes and in his simple pleasures, was\r\nrepresented by his gifted son, Peter A. Jay of Westchester; Daniel D.\r\nTompkins came from Richmond; Rufus King from Queens; Nathan Sanford\r\nand Jacob Radcliff from New York; James Kent, Ambrose Spencer, Abraham\r\nVan Vechten, and Stephen Van Rensselaer from Albany; Jonas Platt,\r\nEzekiel Bacon, and Nathan Williams from Oneida; William W. Van Ness,\r\nElisha Williams, and Jacob R. Van Rensselaer from Columbia; and James\r\nTallmadge and Peter R. Livingston from Dutchess. There was one new\r\nname among them--Samuel Nelson of Cortland, a young man, yet destined\r\nto become a well-known and influential chief justice of the State, and\r\nan associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. The\r\nFederalists of Albany did not return Martin Van Buren, who now made\r\nhis home in their city; but the people of Otsego honoured themselves\r\nand greatly strengthened the convention by making him their\r\nrepresentative. He was clearly its leader. Root and Young did more\r\ntalking, but when others had argued until argument seemed hopeless,\r\nVan Buren usually spoke the last word with success.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, it was recognised that Clinton's friends were without\r\ninfluence. They could talk and vote, but the convention was a Bucktail\r\nbody, in which the election of delegates, the choice of a president,\r\nthe appointment of committees, the selection of chairmen, and the\r\ntransaction of business were made party questions. The vote of sixteen\r\nto ninety-four for Daniel D. Tompkins, for president, showed Bucktail\r\ndelegates overwhelmingly in the majority. Of the chairmen of the ten\r\nstanding committees, all were prominent Bucktail leaders, save Rufus\r\nKing, who had practically ceased to act with the Federalists of his\r\nState, and James, Tallmadge, who ended his affection for DeWitt\r\nClinton when the latter preferred Thomas J. Oakley for attorney-general.\r\n\r\nThe convention's work centred about three great principles--broader\r\nsuffrage, enlarged local government, and a more popular judiciary\r\nsystem. There was no difficulty in abolishing the Councils of\r\nAppointment and of Revision; in clothing the governor with power of\r\nveto; in fixing his term of office at two years instead of three; and\r\nin making members of the Legislature ineligible for appointment to\r\noffice. But, on the questions of suffrage and the judiciary, the\r\nconvention was thrown into weeks of violent debate, memorable by\r\nprophecies never fulfilled, and by criticism that the future quickly\r\ndisproved. In respect to the suffrage, there were practically three\r\ndifferent views. A few members favoured freehold qualifications; a\r\nlarger number believed in universal suffrage; while others stood\r\nbetween the two, desiring the abolition of a freehold qualification,\r\nyet opposing universal suffrage and wishing to place some restrictions\r\non the right to vote. Erastus Root and Samuel Young ably represented\r\nthe second class; Ambrose Spencer and the Federalists were intensely\r\nloyal to a freehold qualification; and Van Buren, backed probably by a\r\nmajority of the convention, presented the compromise view.\r\n\r\nPreliminary to the great debate, a lively skirmish occurred over the\r\nlimitation of suffrage to the white voter. Strangely enough, this\r\nproposition was sustained by Erastus Root, the ardent champion of\r\nuniversal suffrage and the abolition of slavery; and it was opposed\r\nwith equal warmth by Peter A. Jay and the Federalists, who advocated a\r\nfreehold qualification. Van Buren did not speak, but he voted for the\r\nresolution, to eliminate the word \"white,\" which was carried by a\r\nclose vote--sixty-three to fifty-nine. Then it was proposed that\r\ncoloured voters should be freeholders. Again the advocates of\r\nuniversal suffrage favoured the proposition, and the friends of a\r\nfreehold qualification opposed it; but this time the convention\r\ndecided against the negro, thirty-three to seventy-one. New York was\r\nslow to give equal suffrage to the blacks. Nearly three-fourths of the\r\nvoters of the State withheld it in 1846; and, six years after\r\nPresident Lincoln's emancipation proclamation, when the black soldier\r\nhad served his country throughout the Civil War with a fidelity and\r\ncourage that awoke the strongest emotions of a patriotic people, it\r\nwas again refused.\r\n\r\nThe debate, however, which aroused the greatest interest, and in which\r\nmembers of the convention most generally participated, sprang from\r\nAmbrose Spencer's proposition limiting to freeholders the right to\r\nvote for senators. It must have occurred to the Chief Justice that the\r\nconvention was against him, because its committee had unanimously\r\nagreed to abolish the freehold qualification; and, further, because\r\nthe convention, by its action on the negro question, had demonstrated\r\nits purpose to wipe out all property distinctions among white voters;\r\nyet Spencer, at this eleventh hour, proposed to re-establish a\r\nfreehold difference between senators and assemblymen. The Chief\r\nJustice, with all his faults, and they were many and grave, had in him\r\nthe capacity of a statesman; but it was a statesman of fifty years\r\nbefore. He had learned little by experience. The prejudices of Jay and\r\nother patriots of the Revolution, still lingered in his mind, arousing\r\npainful apprehensions of what would happen if the exclusive privileges\r\nof landowners should disappear, and robbing him of that faith in the\r\npeople which made Erastus Root the forerunner of the broad suffrage\r\nthat obtains to-day. Chancellor Kent backed Spencer's proposition in\r\nan abler speech than that made by the Chief Justice himself. Kent was\r\nan honourable, upright statesman, who, unlike Spencer, had never\r\nwavered in his fealty to that federalism which had been learned at the\r\nfeet of John Jay and Alexander Hamilton; but, like Spencer, he had\r\nfailed to discover that the people, jealous of their rights and\r\nliberties, could be trusted regardless of property holdings. \"By the\r\nreport before us,\" he said, \"we propose to annihilate, at one stroke,\r\nall property distinctions, and to bow before the idol of universal\r\nsuffrage. That extreme democratic principle has been regarded with\r\nterror by the wise men of every age, because in every European\r\nrepublic, ancient and modern, in which it has been tried, it has\r\nterminated disastrously, and been productive of corruption, injustice,\r\nviolence, and tyranny. And dare we flatter ourselves that we are a\r\npeculiar people, who can run the career of history exempted from the\r\npassions which have disturbed and corrupted the rest of mankind? If we\r\nare like other races of men, with similar follies and vices, then I\r\ngreatly fear that our posterity will have reason to deplore in\r\nsackcloth and ashes the delusion of the day.\"[219]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n2, p. 34.]\r\n\r\nThough Erastus Root and Samuel Young employed all their eloquence and\r\nall their energy against Spencer's proposition, it was Martin Van\r\nBuren's speech which made the deepest impression. It cannot be said\r\nthat the latter's remarks defeated the amendment, because the vote of\r\nnineteen to one hundred, showed no one behind the Chief Justice's\r\nproposal save himself and a few Federalists. But Van Buren greatly\r\nstrengthened the report of the committee, which gave a vote to every\r\nmale citizen twenty-one years old, who had resided six months in the\r\nState and who had within one year paid taxes or a road assessment, or\r\nhad been enrolled and served in the militia. Although, said Van Buren,\r\nthis report is on the verge of universal suffrage, it did not cheapen\r\nthe invaluable right, by conferring it indiscriminately upon every\r\none, black or white, who would condescend to accept it. He was\r\nopposed, he said, to a precipitate and unexpected prostration of all\r\nqualifications, and looked with dread upon the great increase of\r\nvoters in New York City, believing that such an increase would render\r\nelections a curse rather than a blessing. But he maintained that the\r\nevents of the past forty years had discredited the speculative fears\r\nof Franklin, Hamilton, and Madison; that venality in voting, in spite\r\nof property qualifications, already existed in grossest forms in\r\nparliamentary elections in England, and that property had been as safe\r\nin those American communities which had given universal suffrage as in\r\nthe few which retained a freehold qualification. Then, with great\r\nearnestness, his eye resting upon the distinguished Chancellor, he\r\ndeclared that whenever the principles of order and good government\r\nshould yield to principles of anarchy and violence, all constitutional\r\nprovisions would be idle and unavailing.\r\n\r\nIt was a captivating speech. There was little rhetoric and less\r\nfeeling. Van Buren took good care to show his thorough knowledge of\r\nthe subject, and, without the use of exclamations or interrogations,\r\nhe pointed out the unwisdom of following the constitution-makers of\r\n1777, and the danger of accepting the dogma of universal suffrage. The\r\nimpression we get from the declaration of some of those who heard it,\r\nis that Van Buren surpassed himself in this effort. He seems to have\r\nmade a large majority of the convention happy because he said just\r\nwhat they wanted to know, and said it in just the way they wanted to\r\nhear it. It must be admitted, too, that the evils which he prophesied,\r\nif universal suffrage were given to New York City, have been too\r\nunhappily verified. With the defeat of Spencer's proposition, the\r\nsuffrage question quickly settled itself along the lines of the\r\ncommittee's report.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary article excited less debate but more feeling. Delegates\r\nbrooded over the well known fact that judges had become political\r\npartisans, opposed to increasing their number to meet the growing\r\ndemands of business, and anxious to retain the extraordinary power\r\ngiven them under the Constitution of 1777. Whenever a suggestion was\r\nmade to retain these judges, therefore, it provoked bitter opposition\r\nand denunciation. A few men in the convention had very fierce\r\nopinions, seasoned with a kind of wit, and of these, the restless\r\nenergy of Erastus Root soon earned for him considerable notoriety.\r\nIndeed, it passed into a sort of proverb that there were three parties\r\nin the convention--the Republicans, the Federalists, and Erastus Root.\r\nIt is not so clear that he had as much influence as his long\r\nprominence in public life would seem to entitle him; but when he did\r\nhappen to stand with the majority, he pleased it with his witty\r\nvehemence more than Peter R. Livingston did with his coarse\r\nvituperation. In the debate on the judiciary, however, abuse and\r\ninvective were not confined to Root and Livingston. Abraham Van\r\nVechten and some of those who acted with him, employed every means in\r\ntheir power to defeat the opponents of the judges, although they\r\nscarcely equalled the extra-tribunal methods of their adversaries.\r\n\r\nThe contest opened as soon as the chairman of the judiciary committee\r\nreported in favour of a vice chancellor, from whom appeals should be\r\ntaken to the chancellor; and of a superior court of common pleas,\r\nhaving practically the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, which should\r\nform a part of the Court for the Correction of Errors. This meant the\r\ncontinuation of the old judges. Immediately, Erastus Root offered a\r\nsubstitute, abolishing the existing courts, and creating a new Supreme\r\nCourt, with a corps of _nisi prius_ district judges. Root's plan also\r\nprovided for the transfer of the equitable powers of the Court of\r\nChancery to the courts of common law. This was the extreme view.\r\nAlthough the convention, or at least a majority of it, might wish to\r\nget rid of the old Supreme Court judges, it was plainly unwilling to\r\nlet go the Court of Chancery. So it rejected the Root substitute by a\r\nvote of seventy-three to thirty-six, and the report of the judiciary\r\ncommittee by seventy-nine ayes to thirty-three noes. But the attack\r\nthus daringly begun by Root, was steadily maintained. Martin Van\r\nBuren, who figured as a sort of peacemaker, proposed the retention of\r\nthe Chancery and Supreme Courts, and the creation of circuit judges.\r\nThis proposition went to a special committee, which presented two\r\nreports--one for the preservation of the Court of Chancery and the\r\nSupreme Court, the other for the creation of a Court of Chancery, a\r\nSupreme Court, and courts of common pleas. It was plain that the\r\nsecond of these was Root's former substitute, with the Court of\r\nChancery continued, and, in support of it, he now arraigned the\r\npolitical conduct of the judges with a severity that was speedily\r\nrebuked. Root was radical or nothing. He hated Spencer, he despised\r\nVan Ness, and he disliked James Kent and Jonas Platt; and with an\r\nexuberance of apparent anger he demanded the abolition of their courts\r\nand the creation of others in no wise different.\r\n\r\nIn replying to Root, Van Buren again discovered his kindliness of\r\nheart. The only question, he said, was whether the convention would\r\ninsert an article in the Constitution for the sole purpose of vacating\r\nthe offices of the present chancellor, and Supreme Court judges, and\r\nthus apply a rule which had not yet been applied in a single instance.\r\nThere could be no public reason for the measure and personal feeling\r\nshould not control. Referring to William W. Van Ness, he declared that\r\nhe could with truth say that, throughout his whole life, he had been\r\nassailed by him with hostility--political, professional and\r\npersonal--hostility which had been keen, active, and unyielding. \"But,\r\nsir, am I on that account to indulge my individual resentment in the\r\nprostration of my private and political adversary? If I could be\r\ncapable of such conduct I should forever despise myself.\" In\r\nconclusion, he expressed the hope that the convention would not ruin\r\nits character and credit by proceeding to such extremities. Van Buren\r\nstruck hard, and for the time had routed the judges' opponents by a\r\nvote of sixty-four to forty-four. But if the delegates hesitated to\r\nback Root, they did not propose to follow Van Buren, and they crushed\r\nthe first report under the unexpected vote of eighty-six to\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\nThe convention had now been in session over two months, and this most\r\ntroublesome question seemed no nearer settlement than on the opening\r\nday. As in the suffrage debate, there were three factions--one\r\ndetermined to get rid of Chancellor Kent and the five Supreme Court\r\njudges; another, less numerous, desirous of continuing them all in\r\noffice, and a third, probably composed of a majority of the\r\nconvention, who wished to save the chancellor and lose the others.\r\nFinally, on the first day of November, ten days before adjournment, a\r\nproposition appeared to create a Supreme Court to consist of a chief\r\njustice and two justices, and to divide the State into not less than\r\nfour or more than eight districts, as the Legislature should decide,\r\nin each of which a district judge should be appointed, with the tenure\r\nand powers of Supreme Court judges. It was also provided that such\r\nequity powers should be vested in the district judges, in courts of\r\ncommon pleas, or in other subordinate courts, as the Legislature might\r\ndirect, subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the chancellor. This\r\nwas practically Root's old proposition in another form, and its\r\nreappearance made it the more certain that a majority of the\r\nconvention had determined to destroy the present judges.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, the members of the court, all of whom were delegates,\r\neither from motives of modesty, or with the hope that the many plans\r\nmight result in no action, had taken no part in the debates on the\r\njudiciary. Now, however, Ambrose Spencer, with doubtful propriety,\r\nbroke the silence. His friends feared the assaults of Root and Peter\r\nR. Livingston might drive him into a fierce retort, and that he would\r\nantagonise the convention if he did not also weary it. But he did\r\nnothing of the kind. He spoke with calmness and excellent taste,\r\nsaying that he favoured the appointment of circuit judges who should\r\naid the Supreme Court in the trial of issues of fact, and who should\r\nalso be members, _ex-officio_, of the Court of Errors; that he had\r\nlittle or no personal interest in the question since he should very\r\nsoon be constitutionally ineligible to the office; that for eighteen\r\nyears he had tried to discharge his duties with fidelity and\r\nintegrity, and that he should leave the bench conscious of having done\r\nno wrong if he had not always had the approval of others. He seemed to\r\ncapture the convention for a moment. His tones were mellow, his\r\nmanner gentle, and when he suggested leaving Albany on the morrow to\r\nresume his labours on the bench, his remarks took the form of a\r\nfarewell speech, which added a touch of pathos. Indeed, the Chief\r\nJustice had proved so wise and discreet that Henry Wheaton thought it\r\nan opportune time to propose an amendment to the proposition before\r\nthe convention, providing that the present justices hold office until\r\ntheir number be reduced to three, by death, resignation, removal, or\r\nby age limitation. This brought the convention face to face with the\r\nquestion of retaining the old judges, stripped of all other\r\nprovisions, and the result was awaited with great interest. It was Van\r\nBuren's idea. It had the support, too, of Nathan Sanford, of Peter B.\r\nSharpe, the speaker of the Assembly, and of half a score of prominent\r\nBucktails who hoped, with Van Buren, that the convention would not\r\nruin its character by extreme measures based upon personal dislikes;\r\nbut a majority of the delegates was in no mood for such a suggestion.\r\nIt had listened respectfully to the Chief Justice, and would doubtless\r\nhave cheerfully heard from the Chancellor and other members of the\r\ncourt, but it could not surrender the principle over which sixty days\r\nhad been spent in contention. When, therefore, the roll was called,\r\nWheaton's amendment was rejected by a vote of sixty-six to\r\nthirty-nine. Then came the call on the original proposition, to have\r\nSupreme and District Courts, which disclosed sixty-two ayes and\r\nfifty-three noes. If the weakness of the noes on the first vote was a\r\ndisappointment, the strength of the noes on the second vote was a\r\nsurprise. A change of only five votes was needed to defeat the\r\nproposition, and these might have been reduced to three had Daniel D.\r\nTompkins, who favoured Van Buren's idea, and the four judges who\r\nrefrained from voting, felt at liberty to put themselves upon record.\r\nIt is a notable fact that the conspicuous, able men of the convention,\r\nwith the exception of Erastus Root and Samuel Young, voted to continue\r\nthe judges in office.\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren, as chairman of the committee to consider the\r\nquestion of filling offices, reported in favour of abolishing the\r\nCouncil of Appointment, and of electing state officers by the\r\nLegislature, justices of the peace by the people, and military\r\nofficers, except generals, by the rank and file of the militia.\r\nJudicial officers, with surrogates and sheriffs, were to be appointed\r\nby the governor and confirmed by the Senate, while courts were\r\nauthorised to select county clerks and district attorneys. To the\r\ncommon councils of cities was committed the duty of choosing mayors\r\nand clerks. In his statement, Van Buren said that of the eight\r\nthousand two hundred and eighty-seven military officers in the State,\r\nall would be elected by the rank and file, except seventy-eight\r\ngenerals; and of the six thousand six hundred and sixty-three civil\r\nofficers, all would be elected by the people or designated as the\r\nLegislature should direct, except four hundred and fifty-three. To\r\nprovide for these five hundred and thirty-one military and civil\r\nofficers, the committee thought it wise to have the governor appoint\r\nand the Senate confirm them. The constitutions recently formed in\r\nKentucky, Louisiana, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri, he said, had\r\nsuch a provision--similar, in fact, to that in the Federal\r\nConstitution--and, although this method was open to objection, the\r\ncommittee was unable to devise a better system.\r\n\r\nAside from James Tallmadge, who thought the Legislature should have\r\nnothing to do with the patronage of government, this report called out\r\nlittle opposition, so far as it provided for the election of state\r\nofficers by the Legislature, military officers by the militia, and the\r\nappointment of higher military and judicial officers by the governor.\r\nVan Buren had made it plain, by his exhaustive argument, that\r\nconstitution-makers, seeking the latest expression of the people's\r\nwill, could devise no better plan, and that experience in the newest\r\nStates having the same system, had developed no serious objection.\r\nThere was a readiness, also, to accept the recommendation allowing the\r\nLegislature to designate the manner of selecting the three thousand\r\nsix hundred and forty-three notaries public, commissioners of deeds,\r\nand other minor officers. But a buzz of disapproval ran through the\r\nconvention when the article providing for the election of justices of\r\nthe peace was reached. It was evident from the outset, that a\r\nconcerted movement was on foot among Republican leaders to establish,\r\nat the seat of government, a central appointing power of large\r\nauthority, and the appointment of justices of the peace was peculiarly\r\nessential to its strength. A justice was of more importance then than\r\nnow. He was usually the strongest character in his vicinage, and\r\nwhether he followed the plow, or wore upon the bench the homely\r\nworking clothes in which he tended cattle, he was none the less\r\nfamiliar with the politics of every suitor in his court. In the\r\nabsence of higher courts, neighbours were compelled to go before him,\r\nand in settling their troubles, it was usually understood that he held\r\nthe scales of justice without being blindfolded.\r\n\r\nVan Buren did not conceal his hostility to the election of these\r\njustices. If he had developed radical tendencies in the suffrage\r\ndebate, he now exhibited equally strong conservative proclivities in\r\nlimiting the power of the voter. His vigorous protests in the\r\ncommittee-room against the election of surrogates, sheriffs and county\r\nclerks had defeated that proposition, and in referring to the section\r\nof the report making justices of the peace elective, he said it had\r\nbeen a source of sincere regret that the committee overruled him. But\r\na majority of the committee, he continued, in his smooth and adroit\r\nmanner, had no strong personal predilections on the question of the\r\nelection of sheriffs and surrogates, and if, on a fair and deliberate\r\nexamination, it should be thought better to have these officials\r\nelected by the people, they would cheerfully acquiesce in that\r\ndecision. This was the quintessence of diplomacy. He knew that Erastus\r\nRoot and Samuel Young insisted upon having these officers elected,\r\nand, to secure their opposition to the election of justices of the\r\npeace, he indicated a willingness to be convinced as to the expediency\r\nof electing sheriffs and surrogates.\r\n\r\nTo bring the question of electing or appointing justices of the peace\r\nsquarely before the convention, Van Buren, at a later day, introduced\r\na resolution providing that the board of supervisors in every county\r\nshould, at such time as the Legislature directed, recommend to the\r\ngovernor a list of persons equal in number to the justices of the\r\npeace in such county; that the respective courts of common pleas of\r\nthe several counties should also recommend a like number, and from the\r\nlists so recommended the governor should appoint. In the event of\r\nvacancies, like recommendations were to be made. The governor was also\r\nauthorised to remove a justice upon the application in writing of the\r\nbody recommending his appointment. This scheme was not very\r\nmagnificent. It put the responsibility of selection neither upon\r\nsupervisors, courts, nor governor, although each one must act\r\nindependently of the other, but it gave the governor a double chance\r\nof appointing men of his own political faith. This was Van Buren's\r\npurpose. He believed in a central appointing power, which the Albany\r\nRegency might control, and, that such power should not be impotent,\r\nthese minor and many magistrates, thickly distributed throughout the\r\nState, with a jurisdiction broad enough to influence their\r\nneighbourhoods, became of the greatest importance. To secure their\r\nappointment, therefore, Van Buren was ready to sacrifice the\r\nappointment of sheriffs, with their vast army of deputies.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's scheme was ably resisted. Rufus King, who was counted a\r\nBucktail but until now had taken little part in debate, spoke against\r\nit with all the sincere emotion of one whose mind and heart alike were\r\nfilled with the cause for which he pleaded. He thought justices should\r\nbe elected. Each locality knew the men in whom it could trust to\r\nsettle its disputes, and farmers as well as townspeople should be\r\nallowed to select the arbitrator of all their petty quarrels and\r\ndisagreements. It was the very essence of home rule. In vigorous\r\nEnglish Ambrose Spencer, William W. Van Ness, and Jacob R. Van\r\nRensselaer supported the Senator, while Ogden Edwards of New York\r\nCity, an able representative of Tammany, burning with a sense of\r\ninjustice, violently assailed the proposed plan. \"The unanimous vote\r\nof this convention,\" he said, \"had shown that the Council of\r\nAppointment was an evil. A unanimous sentence of condemnation has been\r\npassed upon it, and I had not expected so soon to find a proposition\r\nfor its revival.\"\r\n\r\nProbably no stranger scene was ever witnessed in a parliamentary body\r\nthan Erastus Root and Samuel Young, two radical legislators, advocates\r\nof universal suffrage, and just now especially conspicuous because of\r\ntheir successful support of the election of sheriffs and county\r\nclerks, arguing with zeal and ability for the appointment of justices\r\nof the peace. It seemed like a travesty, since there was not an\r\nargument in favour of electing sheriffs that did not apply with added\r\nforce to the election of justices. The convention stood aghast at such\r\neffrontery. It is impossible to read, without regret, of the voluntary\r\nstultification of these orators, pleading piteously for the\r\nappointment of justices of the peace while declaiming with passionate\r\nrighteousness against the appointment of sheriffs. With acidulated\r\nsatire, Van Ness, enrapturing his hearers by his brilliancy, held them\r\nup to public ridicule if not to public detestation. But Van Buren's\r\nbungling proposition, though once rejected by a vote of fifty-nine to\r\nfifty-six, was in the end substantially adopted, and it remained a\r\npart of the amended constitution until the people, very soon satisfied\r\nof its iniquity, ripped it out of the organic law with the same\r\nunanimity that their representatives now abolished the Councils of\r\nAppointment and of Revision. Could Van Buren have had his way, the\r\nCouncil of Appointment would have been changed only in name.\r\n\r\nThe work of the convention concluded, a motion for the passage of the\r\nConstitution as a whole developed only eight votes in the negative,\r\nthough twenty-four members, including the eight delegates from Albany\r\nand Columbia Counties, four from Montgomery, Jonas Platt of Oneida,\r\nand Peter A. Jay of Westchester, because it extended and cheapened\r\nsuffrage, refused to sign it. Other objections were urged. Ezekiel\r\nBacon of Utica, explaining his affirmative vote, thought it worse\r\nthan the existing Constitution of 1777; yet he approved it because the\r\nprovision for amendment afforded the people a means of correcting\r\ndefects with reasonable facility, without resorting to the difficult\r\nand dangerous experiment of a formal convention.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, however, in spite of the opposition, was\r\noverwhelmingly ratified. The vote for it was 74,732; against it\r\n41,043. And it proved better than even its sponsors prophesied. It\r\nabolished the Councils of Appointment and of Revision; it abolished\r\nthe power of the governor to prorogue the Legislature; it abolished\r\nthe property qualification of the white voter; it extended the\r\nelective franchise; it made a large number of officers elective; it\r\nmodified the management of the canals and created a canal board; it\r\ncontinued the Court of Errors and Impeachments; it reorganised the\r\njudicial department, making all judges, surrogates, and recorders\r\nappointive by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate;\r\nit made state officers, formerly appointed by the Council, elective by\r\njoint ballot of the Senate and Assembly; and it gave the power of veto\r\nexclusively to the governor, requiring a two-thirds vote of the\r\nLegislature to overcome it. No doubt it had radical defects, but with\r\nthe help of a few amendments it lived for a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND FALL OF CLINTON\r\n\r\n1822\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new Constitution changed the date of elections from April to\r\nNovember, and reduced the gubernatorial term from three years to two,\r\nthus ending Governor Clinton's administration on January 1, 1823. As\r\nthe time approached for nominating his successor, it was obvious that\r\nthe Bucktails, having reduced party discipline to a science and\r\nlaunched the Albany Regency upon its long career of party domination,\r\nwere certain to control the election. Indeed, so strong had the party\r\nbecome that a nomination for senator or assemblyman was equivalent to\r\nan election, and the defeat of John W. Taylor of Saratoga for speaker\r\nof the Seventeenth Congress showed that its power extended to the\r\ncapital of the nation. Taylor's ability and splendid leadership, in\r\nthe historic contest of the Missouri Compromise, had made him speaker\r\nduring the second session of the Sixteenth Congress; but Bucktail\r\nresentment of his friendly attitude toward Clinton, in 1820, changed a\r\nsufficient number of his New York colleagues to deprive him of\r\nre-election. It was not until the Nineteenth Congress, after the power\r\nof the Albany Regency had been temporarily broken by the election of\r\nJohn Quincy Adams to the Presidency, that Taylor finally received the\r\nreward to which he was so richly entitled.\r\n\r\nAt this moment of the Regency's domination, Joseph C. Yates showed\r\nhimself the coming man. Though it was the desire of his party that he\r\ntake the nomination for governor in 1820, the cautious, modest Justice\r\nof the Supreme Court had discreetly decided not to sacrifice himself\r\nin the year of DeWitt Clinton's greatest strength. Conscious of his\r\nown popularity with the people, he was prepared to wait. But he had\r\nnot to wait long. During the last two years of Clinton's\r\nadministration, Yates had distinguished himself in the Council of\r\nRevision, by voting for the bill creating a constitutional\r\nconvention--a vote which was applauded by Van Buren, although overcome\r\nby Clinton; and when the time approached for the selection of another\r\ngubernatorial candidate, he rightly saw that his hour was come. Yates\r\nwas not cut out for the part which a strange combination of\r\ncircumstances was to allow him to play. He was a man of respectable\r\ncharacter, but without remarkable capacity of any kind. He had a\r\ncharming personality. He was modest and mild in his deportment, and\r\nrichly gifted with discretion, caution, and prudence. Vindictiveness\r\nformed no part of his disposition. The peculiar character of his\r\nintellect made him a good Supreme Court judge; but he lacked the\r\nintellectual energy and courage for an executive, who must thoroughly\r\nunderstand the means of getting and retaining public support.\r\n\r\nA majority of the leading politicians of the party, appreciating\r\nYates' mental deficiencies, ranged themselves on the side of Samuel\r\nYoung, who enjoyed playing a conspicuous part and liked attacking\r\nsomebody. Young was not merely a debater of apparently inexhaustible\r\nresource, but a master in the use of parliamentary tactics and\r\npolitical craft. His speeches, or such reports of them as exist, are\r\nfull of striking passages and impressive phrases; and, as an orator,\r\nfull, round and joyous, with singularly graceful and charming manners,\r\nhe was then without a rival in his party. But his ultra-radicalism and\r\nilliberal, often rude, treatment of opponents prevented him from\r\nobtaining all the influence which would otherwise have been fairly due\r\nto his talents and his political and personal integrity.\r\n\r\nThere were, also, other aspirants. Daniel D. Tompkins, preferring\r\ngovernor to Vice President, was willing to be called; and Peter B.\r\nPorter, Erastus Root, and Nathan Sanford, figured among those whose\r\nnames were canvassed. The contest, however, soon settled down between\r\nYates and Young, with the chances decidedly in favour of the former.\r\nPeople admired Young and were proud of him--they thoroughly liked\r\nYates and trusted him. If Young had possessed the kindly, sympathetic\r\ndisposition of Yates, with a tithe of his discretion, he would have\r\nrivalled Martin Van Buren in influence and popularity, and become a\r\nsuccessful candidate for any office in the gift of the voters; but,\r\nwith all his splendid genius for debate and eloquent speaking, he was\r\nneither a patient leader nor a popular one. When the Republican\r\nmembers of the Legislature got into caucus, therefore, Joseph C. Yates\r\nhad a pronounced majority, as had Erastus Root for lieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\nYoung's defeat for the nomination left bitter enmity. A reconciliation\r\ndid, indeed, take place between him and Yates, but it was as formal\r\nand superficial as that of the two demons described in Le Sage's\r\nstory. \"They brought us together,\" says Asmodeus; \"they reconciled us.\r\nWe shook hands and became mortal enemies.\" Young and Yates were\r\nreconciled; but from the moment of Yates' nomination, until, chagrined\r\nand disappointed, he was forced into retirement after two years of\r\nhumiliating obedience to the Regency, Samuel Young spared no effort to\r\nrender his late opponent unpopular.\r\n\r\nAlthough Clinton's canal policy, upon the success of which he had\r\nstaked his all, was signally vindicating itself in rapidity of\r\nconstruction, and the very moderate estimate of cost, his friends did\r\nnot hesitate to advise him that his re-election to the governorship\r\nwas impossible. It was a cold proposition for a man to face who had\r\ninaugurated a system of improvement which would confer prosperity and\r\nwealth upon the people, and enrich and elevate the State. For a time,\r\nlike a caged tiger, he bit at the bars that seemed to limit his\r\nambition. But his friends were right. Through his management, or want\r\nof management, the Clintonians had ceased to exist as an organisation,\r\nand his supporting Federalists, as evidenced by the election of\r\ndelegates to the constitutional convention in 1821, had passed into a\r\nhopeless minority. \"Governor Clinton, though governor,\" said Thurlow\r\nWeed, \"was much in the condition of a pastor without a congregation.\"\r\nIt was striking proof of the absence of tact and that address which,\r\nin a popular government, is necessary for one to possess who expects\r\nto succeed in public life. Clinton had now been governor for five\r\nconsecutive years. His motives had undoubtedly been pure and\r\npatriotic, and he had within his control the means of a great office\r\nto influence people in his favour; yet a cold exterior, an arrogant\r\nmanner, and a disposition to rule or ruin, had cooled his friends and\r\ndriven away the people until opponents took little heed of his\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Clinton had good reason to know that the statesmen of that\r\ntime were not exactly what they professed to be. He was well aware\r\nthat many of them, like John Woodworth, Ambrose Spencer, and James\r\nTallmadge, had played fast and loose as the chances of Bucktail and\r\nClintonian had gone up or gone down; and, although he gracefully\r\ndeclined to become a candidate for re-election, when convinced of the\r\nutter hopelessness of such a race, his brain was no less active in the\r\nconception of plans which should again return him to power. As early\r\nas October, 1822, he wrote Post: \"The odium attached to the name of\r\nFederalist has been a millstone round the neck of true policy. It is\r\nnow almost universally dropped in this district, in the district of\r\nwhich Oneida County is part, and in the Herkimer County meeting. I\r\nhail this as an auspicious event. Names in politics as well as science\r\nare matters of substance, and a bad name in public is as injurious to\r\nsuccess as a bad name in private life. The inferences I draw from the\r\nsigns of the times are: First, the ascendancy of our party from the\r\ncollisions of parties. In proportion as they quarrel with each other\r\nthey will draw closer to us. The last hate being the most violent will\r\nsupersede the former antipathy. Second, the old names as well as the\r\nold lines of party will be abolished. Third, nominations by caucuses\r\nwill be exploded. Fourth, Yates, Van Buren, etc., will go down like\r\nthe stick of a rocket. Our friends are up and doing in Ulster.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to feel admiration for the indomitable courage\r\nand the inexhaustible animal spirits which no defeat could reduce to\r\nprostration. Furthermore, Clinton had written with the inspiration of\r\na prophet. Not only were the old names and the old party lines soon to\r\nvanish, but the last legislative caucus ever to be held in the State,\r\nwould be called in less than two years. Within the same period Yates\r\nwas to fall like the stick of a rocket, and Van Buren to suffer his\r\nfirst defeat.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a Clintonian or Federalist opponent, Solomon\r\nSouthwick announced himself as an independent candidate. His was a\r\nstrange story. He had many of the noblest qualities and some of the\r\nwildest fancies, growing out of an extravagant imagination that seemed\r\nto control his mind. Among other things, he opened an office for the\r\nsale of lottery tickets, reserving numbers for himself which had been\r\nindicated in dreams or by fortune-tellers, with whom he was in\r\nfrequent consultation. Writing of his disposition to hope for aid from\r\nthe miraculous interposition of some invisible power, Hammond says:\r\n\"He was in daily expectation that the next mail would bring him news\r\nthat he had drawn the highest prize in the lottery; and I have known\r\nhim to borrow money of a friend under a solemn pledge of his honour\r\nfor its repayment in ten days, and have afterward ascertained that his\r\nsole expectation of redeeming his pledge depended on his drawing a\r\nprize when the next lottery in which he was interested should be\r\ndrawn.\"[220]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n2, p. 101.]\r\n\r\nSouthwick was undoubtedly a man of genius, as his work on the Albany\r\n_Register_, the _Ploughboy_, and the _Christian Visitant_ clearly\r\nindicates; but erroneous judgment and defective impulses resulted in\r\nmisfortunes which finally darkened and closed his life in adversity if\r\nnot in poverty. As a young man he had been repeatedly elected clerk of\r\nthe Assembly, and had afterward served as sheriff, as state printer,\r\nand, finally, as postmaster. In the meantime, he became the first\r\npresident of the Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank, making money easily and\r\nrapidly, living extravagantly, giving generously, and acquiring great\r\npolitical influence. But his trial for bribery, of which mention has\r\nbeen made, his removal as state printer, and his defalcation as\r\npostmaster, prostrated him financially and politically. In the hope of\r\nretrieving his fortunes he embarked in real estate speculation, thus\r\ncompleting his ruin and making him still more visionary and fantastic.\r\nNevertheless, he struggled on with industry and courage for more than\r\ntwenty years, occasionally coming into public or political notice as a\r\nwriter of caustic letters, or as a candidate for office.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, the wild fancy possessed Southwick of becoming governor, and\r\nto preface the way for his visionary scheme he applied to a bright\r\nyoung journalist, the editor of the Manlius _Republican_, to canvass\r\nthe western and southwestern counties of the State. Thurlow Weed at\r\nthis time was twenty-six years old. He had worked on a farm, he had\r\nblown a blacksmith's bellows, he had shipped as a cabin-boy, he had\r\ndone chores at a tavern, he had served as a soldier, and he had\r\nlearned the printer's trade. For twenty years he lived a life of\r\npoverty, yet of tireless industry, with a simplicity as amazing as his\r\ngenius. The only thing of which he got nothing was schooling. His\r\nfamily was an old Connecticut one, which had come down in the world.\r\nEverything went wrong with his father. He was hard-working,\r\nkind-hearted, and strictly honest, but nothing succeeded. With the\r\nhope of \"bettering his condition,\" he moved five times in ten years,\r\ngetting so desperately poor at last that a borrowed two-horse sleigh\r\ncarried all his worldly goods, including a wife and five children.\r\nJoel Weed was, perhaps, as unfortunate a man as ever brought an\r\nillustrious son into the world. He was neither shiftless nor\r\nworthless, but what others did he could not do. He never took up land\r\nfor himself because he had nothing to begin with. A neighbour who\r\nbegan with an axe and a hoe, entered fifty acres, and got rich.\r\n\r\nIf Joel Weed lived as a beggar, Thurlow thought as a king. He revelled\r\nin the mountains and streams interspersed along the routes of the\r\nfamily's frequent movings; his taste for adventure made the sloop's\r\ncabin a home, and his love for reading turned the blacksmith shop and\r\nprinting office into a schoolroom. As he read he forgot that he was\r\npoor, forgot that he was ragged, forgot that he was hungry. In his\r\nautobiography he tells of walking bare-footed six miles through the\r\nsnow to borrow a history of the French Revolution, and of reading it\r\nat night in the blaze of a pitch-pine knot. Men found him lovable. He\r\nwas large and awkward; but even as a boy there was a charm of manner,\r\na tender, sympathetic nature, a sweet, sparkling humour, and a\r\nnobility of character that irresistibly drew people to him. In many\r\nrespects his boyhood resembled Lincoln's, and, though he lived in some\r\nof the evil days of the last century, his youth, like Lincoln's,\r\nescaped pollution. At the age of twelve, as an apprentice in a weekly\r\nnewspaper office at Onondaga Hollow, he read and filed every exchange\r\npaper, familiarising himself with discussions in Congress, and\r\nimbibing a deadly hatred of England because of Indian barbarities\r\nexcited by British agents, and cruelties to American seamen impressed\r\nby British officers. With the true instinct of his fine nature, he\r\nmade his friends and companions among the wisest and highest of his\r\ntime, although he loved all company that was not vicious and depraved.\r\nHe knew Gerrit Smith in 1814; a few months' stay, as a journeyman\r\nprinter, at Auburn, forged a lasting friendship with Elijah Miller,\r\nthe father-in-law of William H. Seward, and with Enos T. Throop,\r\nafterward governor. His intimacy with Gorham A. Worth, a financier of\r\ndecided literary tastes, and for thirty years president of the New\r\nYork City Bank, began in Albany in 1816. Thus, in whatever town he\r\nworked or settled, the prominent men and those to grow into prominence\r\nbecame his intimates. He had women friends, too, as wisely chosen as\r\nthe men, but Catherine Ostrander was the star of his life. He tells a\r\ntouching little story of this Cooperstown maiden. Their engagement\r\noccurred in his seventeenth year, but her parents, objecting to the\r\nroving, unsettled youth, he proposed three years of absolute\r\nseparation, and if then no change had come to her affections she\r\nshould write and tell him so. In his hours of poverty, he was cheered\r\nby the thought of her, and when, at last, her letter came, he hastened\r\nto claim her as his bride. At the conclusion of the ceremony, he had\r\nmoney enough only to take them back to Albany.\r\n\r\nWeed began the publication of the Manlius _Republican_ in June, 1821.\r\nFor three years previously the _Agriculturist_, published at Norwich,\r\nin Chenango County, had given him proprietorship, some reputation, and\r\nless money; but it had also classified him politically. He had never\r\nbeen a Federalist, nor could he be called a Clintonian, although his\r\nbelief in canal improvement led him to the support of Governor Clinton\r\nand earned for him the opposition of the Bucktails. Like his father he\r\nworked without success, and then moved on to Albany; but he left\r\nbehind him a coterie of distinguished Chenango friends who were ever\r\nafter to follow his leadership. At Albany, he began to earn eighteen\r\ndollars a week as a journeyman printer on the _Argus_. The Bucktails\r\nforced him out and he went on to Manlius, resurrecting the _Times_, an\r\nold Federalist paper, which he called the _Republican_.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Southwick sought him. \"He was insanely\r\nanxious to be governor,\" says Weed, \"and all the more insane because\r\nof its impossibility. He had been editing with great industry and\r\nability the _Ploughboy_ and the _Christian Visitant_, and beguiled\r\nhimself with a confident belief that farmers and Christians,\r\nirrespective of party, would sustain him. He provided me with a horse\r\nand wagon, and gave me a list of the names of gentlemen on whom I was\r\nto call, but I soon discovered that my friend's hopes and chances were\r\nnot worth even the services of a horse that was dragging me through\r\nthe mud. Years afterward I learned that in politics, as almost in\r\neverything else, Mr. Southwick was blinded by his enthusiasm and\r\ncredulity.\"[221]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 86.]\r\n\r\nBut Southwick was not the only blinded one in 1822. On the 10th of\r\nJanuary, Governor Clinton wrote Henry Post \"that Yates and Van Buren\r\nare both prostrate, and the latter particularly so.\"[222] Later in the\r\nyear, on August 21, he declared: \"Yates is unpopular, and Southwick\r\nwill beat him in this city and in Schenectady.\"[223] In the next\r\nmonth, September 21, he is even more outspoken. \"Yates is despised and\r\ntalked against openly. Savage and Skinner talk plainly against him,\r\nand he is the subject of commonplace ridicule.\"[224] Clinton was the\r\nlast person to abandon hope of Yates' defeat; and yet Yates' election\r\ncould, without exaggeration, be declared practically unanimous.[225]\r\nRepublican legislative candidates fared equally well. Clintonians and\r\nFederalists were entirely without representation in the Senate, and in\r\nthe Assembly their number was insufficient to make their presence\r\nappreciable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 507.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: _Ibid._, p. 565.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: _Ibid._, p. 565.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: Southwick received 2910 out of a total of 131,403 votes\r\ncast.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nCLINTON AGAIN IN THE SADDLE\r\n\r\n1823-1824\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election in the fall of 1822 was one of those sweeping, crushing\r\nvictories that precede a radical change; and the confidence with which\r\nthe victors used their power hurried on the revolution prophesied in\r\nClinton's clever letter to Post. The blow did not, indeed, come at\r\nonce. The legislators, meeting in January, 1823, proceeded cautiously,\r\nagreeing in caucus upon the state officers whom the Legislature, under\r\nthe amended Constitution, must now elect. John Van Ness Yates, the\r\nGovernor's nephew, was made secretary of state; William L. Marcy,\r\ncomptroller; Simeon DeWitt, surveyor-general, and Alexander M. Muir,\r\ncommissary-general. The caucus hesitated to nominate DeWitt because he\r\nwas a Clintonian; but forty years of honourable, efficient, quiet\r\nservice finally appealed to a Republican Legislature with all the\r\nforce that it had formerly appealed to the Skinner Council. There was\r\nmore of a contest over the comptrollership. James Tallmadge suddenly\r\nblossomed into a rival candidate. Tallmadge, like John W. Taylor, won\r\nhis spurs as a leader of the opposition to the Missouri Compromise. He\r\nhad been an ardent supporter of Clinton until the latter preferred\r\nThomas J. Oakley as attorney-general; then he swung into communion\r\nwith the Bucktails. He was impulsively ambitious, sensitive to\r\nopposition, fearless in action, and such an inveterate hater that he\r\ncould not always act along lines leading to his own preferment.\r\n\r\nUnder the new Constitution, county judges, surrogates, and notaries\r\npublic were selected from the dominant party with more jealous care\r\nthan by the old Council; and if Yates failed to observe the edict of\r\nthe Regency, the Senate failed to confirm his appointees. Hammond, the\r\nhistorian, gives an instance of its refusal to confirm the\r\nreappointment of a bank cashier as a notary public because of his\r\npolitics. But the really absorbing question was the appointment of\r\nSupreme Court judges. Though there was no objection to Nathan Sanford\r\nfor chancellor, since he would not take office until the retirement of\r\nJames Kent, in August, by reason of age limitation, the spirit shown\r\nin the constitutional convention, toward the old Supreme Court judges,\r\npervaded the Senate. The Governor, who had served with Ambrose Spencer\r\nsince 1808, and with Platt and Woodworth from the time of their\r\nelevation to the court, was prompted, perhaps through his kindly\r\ninterest in their welfare, to nominate them for reappointment, but the\r\nSenate rejected them by an almost unanimous vote. If the Governor had\r\nnow let the matter rest, he would doubtless have escaped the serious\r\ncharge of insincerity. The next day, however, without giving the\r\nrejected men opportunity to secure a rehearing, he nominated John\r\nSavage, Jacob Sutherland, and Samuel R. Betts. The suddenness of these\r\nsecond nominations seemed to indicate a greater desire to continue\r\ncordial relations with the Senate than to help his former associates.\r\nWhatever the cause, though, Ambrose Spencer never forgave him; nor did\r\nhe outlive Samuel Young's criticism of playing politics at the expense\r\nof his old comrades upon the bench.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Ambrose Spencer, who was destined to be\r\nremembered for a time by friends and enemies, the old judges of the\r\nSupreme Court may now be said to drop out of state history. Spencer\r\nlived twenty-five years longer, until 1848, serving one term in\r\nCongress, one term as mayor of Albany, and finally rounding out his\r\nlong life of eighty-three years as president of the national Whig\r\nconvention at Baltimore in 1844; but his political and public\r\nactivity, as a factor to be reckoned with, ceased at the age of\r\nfifty-eight. The close of his life was spent in happy quietude among\r\nhis books, and in the midst of new-found friends in the church, with\r\nwhich he united some six or eight years before his death. Jonas Platt\r\nreturned to Clinton County, and, for a time, practised his profession\r\nwith great acceptance as an advocate; but as a master-politician he,\r\nlike Spencer, was out of employment forever. At last, he, too, retired\r\nto a farm, and with composure awaited the end that came in 1834.\r\nWilliam W. Van Ness was destined to go earlier. Not seeking\r\nreappointment to the bench, he settled in New York, with apparently\r\nforty years of life before him, his genius in all the glow of its\r\nmaturity marking him for greater political success than he had yet\r\nachieved; yet, within a year, on February 27, 1823, death found him\r\nwhile he sought health in a Southern State. He was only forty-seven\r\nyears old at the time. Disease and not age had thrown him. Born in\r\n1776, he had won for himself the proudest honours of the law, and\r\nwritten his name high up on the roll of New York statesmen.\r\n\r\nGovernor Yates had thus far travelled a difficult and dusty road. In\r\nthe duty of organising the government, which, under the new\r\nConstitution fell to him, and in making appointments, he received the\r\ncensure and was burdened with the resentment of the mortified and\r\ndisappointed. His opponents, with the hearty and poorly concealed\r\napproval of Young's friends, made it their business to create a public\r\nopinion against him. They assailed him at all points with ridicule,\r\nwith satire, with vituperation, and with personal abuse. They seemed\r\nto lie in wait to find occasion for attacking him, exaggerating his\r\nweaknesses and minimising his strength. But the blunder that broke his\r\nheart, and sent him into unexpected and sudden retirement, was his\r\nopposition to a change in the law providing for the choice of\r\npresidential electors by the people. The demand for such a measure\r\ngrew out of a divided sentiment between William H. Crawford, then\r\nsecretary of the treasury, John Quincy Adams, secretary of state, and\r\nHenry Clay, speaker of the national House of Representatives, the\r\nleading candidates for President. There was, as yet, no real break in\r\nthe Republican party. No national question had appeared upon which\r\nthe nation was divided; and, although individuals in the South took\r\nexception to protective duties, the party had made no claim that the\r\ntariff system of 1816 was either inexpedient or unconstitutional. The\r\nselection of a candidate for President had, however, become intensely\r\npersonal, dividing the country into excited factions equivalent to a\r\ndivision of parties. In New York, Van Buren and the Albany Regency\r\nfavoured Crawford; James Tallmadge, Henry Wheaton, Thurlow Weed and\r\nothers preferred Adams; and Samuel Young, Peter B. Porter and their\r\nfriends warmly supported Clay. The heated contest extended to the\r\npeople, who understood that the choice of Crawford electors by the\r\nLegislature would control the election for the Georgian, while a\r\nchange in the law would give Adams or Clay a chance. To insure such a\r\nchange, the opponents of Crawford, calling themselves the People's\r\nparty, made several nominations for the Assembly, and among those\r\nelected by overwhelming majorities were Tallmadge and Wheaton.\r\n\r\nIf Tallmadge was the most conspicuous leader of the People's party,\r\nHenry Wheaton was easily second. Though seven years younger, he had\r\nalready made himself prominent, not merely as a politician of general\r\nability, but as a reporter of the United States Supreme Court, whose\r\nconscientious and intelligent work was to link his name forever with\r\nthe jurisprudence of the country. During the War of 1812, Wheaton had\r\nedited the _National Advocate_, writing a series of important papers\r\non neutral rights; and, subsequently, he had become division\r\njudge-advocate of the army, and justice of the marine court of New\r\nYork City. From the constitutional convention of 1821, he stepped into\r\nthe Assembly of 1824, where, in the debates over the choice of\r\nelectors by the people, his ready eloquence made him a valuable ally\r\nfor Tallmadge and a formidable opponent to Flagg. His ambition to\r\nshine as a statesman, and an extraordinary power of application,\r\nequipped him with varied information, and made him an authority on\r\nmany subjects. He joined Benjamin F. Butler in the revision of the\r\nstatutes of the State, and was associated with Daniel Webster in\r\nsettling the limits of the bankruptcy legislation of the state and\r\nfederal governments. Just now he was still a young man, only in his\r\nthirty-ninth year; but those who had seen his keen, clever articles on\r\nneutral rights, polished and penetrating in style, and who heard his\r\nskilful and fearless advocacy of the people's right to choose\r\nelectors, were not surprised to learn of his appointment, in later\r\nlife, as a lecturer at Harvard, or to read his great work on the\r\n_Elements of International Law_, published in 1836. As a reward for\r\nthe part he took in the election of 1824, President Adams sent him to\r\nDenmark, from whence he went to Prussia--these appointments keeping\r\nhim abroad for twenty years.\r\n\r\nJohn Van Ness Yates urged his uncle to recommend a change in the law\r\nregulating the choice of electors; and if the Governor had possessed\r\nthe political wisdom necessary in such an emergency, he would\r\ndoubtless have taken the suggestion. But Yates thought it wise to\r\nfollow the Regency; the Regency thought it wise to follow Van Buren;\r\nand Van Buren opposed a change, as prejudicial to Crawford's\r\ninterests. The result was a bungling attempt on the part of the\r\nGovernor to evade the direct expression of an opinion. Finally,\r\nhowever, he said that as Congress was likely soon to present an\r\namendment to the Constitution for legislative sanction, it was\r\ninadvisable \"under existing circumstances\" to change the law \"at this\r\ntime.\"[226] This was neither skilful nor truthful. Congress had no\r\nthought of doing anything of the kind, and, if it had, men knew that\r\nan amendment could not be secured in time to operate at the coming\r\nelection. Yates' message, therefore, was pronounced \"a shabby dodge,\"\r\na trick familiar to many statesmen in difficulties.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: _Governors Speeches_, Aug. 2, 1824, p. 218.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature convened, in January, 1824, a bill authorising\r\nthe people to choose electors naturally excited a long and bitter\r\ndebate, in which Azariah C. Flagg represented the Regency. Flagg was\r\na printer by trade, the publisher of a Republican paper at Plattsburg,\r\nand a veteran of the War of 1812. He was not prepossessing in\r\nappearance; his diminutive stature, surmounted by a big, round head\r\ngave him the appearance of Atlas with the world upon his shoulders.\r\nHis voice, too, was shrill and unattractive; but he suddenly evinced\r\nshrewdness and address in legislative tactics that greatly worried his\r\nopponents and pleased his friends. A majority of the Assembly,\r\nhowever, afraid of their excited and indignant constituents, finally\r\npassed the bill. When it reached the Senate, the supporters of\r\nCrawford indefinitely postponed it by a vote of seventeen to fourteen.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of this measure raised a storm of popular indignation.\r\nPeople were exasperated. Newspapers, opposed to the Van Buren leaders,\r\npublished in black-letter type the names of senators who voted against\r\nit, while the frequenters of public places denounced them as\r\n\"traitors, villains, and rascals,\" with the result that most of them\r\nwere consigned to retirement during the remainder of their lives. \"The\r\nimpression here is that Van Buren and his junto are politically dead,\"\r\nwrote DeWitt Clinton to Henry Post on the 17th of February, 1824. \"The\r\nimpression will produce the event.\"[227]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 568.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this excitement, came the selection of a candidate for\r\ngovernor, to be elected in the following November. Yates had done the\r\nbidding of the Regency and Flagg demanded his renomination, but the\r\nmen who supported a change in the mode of choosing electors declared\r\nthat Yates was the original opponent of the people's wishes, and that,\r\nif renominated, he could not be re-elected. \"If the Governor is to be\r\nsacrificed for his fidelity,\" retorted Flagg, \"I am ready to suffer\r\nwith him.\" From a sentimental standpoint, this avowal was most\r\ncreditable and generous, but it had no place in the councils of\r\npoliticians to whom sentiment never appeals when the shrouded figure\r\nof defeat stands at the open door. Just now, too, their fears\r\nincreased as evidence accumulated that Samuel Young would certainly be\r\noffered a nomination by the People's party, and would certainly accept\r\nit, if he were not quickly nominated by the Regency Republicans. When\r\nthe legislators went into caucus on the 3d of April, 1824, therefore,\r\nthe friends of Van Buren were ready to throw over Yates and to accept\r\nYoung, with Erastus Root for lieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\nThree days afterward, the most influential and active friends of John\r\nQuincy Adams and Henry Clay decided that a state convention--consisting\r\nof as many delegates as there were members of the Assembly, to be\r\nchosen by voters opposed to William H. Crawford for President and in\r\nfavour of restoring the choice of presidential electors to the\r\npeople--should assemble at Utica, on September 21, 1824, to nominate\r\ncandidates for governor and lieutenant-governor. It had long been a\r\ndream of Clinton to have nominations made by delegates elected by the\r\npeople. That dream was now to be realised, and the door to a new\r\npolitical era opened.\r\n\r\nThough Clinton had announced a determination to support Andrew\r\nJackson, he displayed no zeal in the state contest, and contented\r\nhimself with writing gossipy letters to Post and in watching the rapid\r\ngrowth of the Erie canal. As early as 1819, the canal had been opened\r\nbetween Utica and Rome, and from the Hudson to Lake Champlain. The\r\nmiddle section, recently completed, was now actively in use between\r\nUtica and Montezuma. In little more than a year, the jubilee over the\r\nletting in of the waters of Lake Erie would deaden the strife of\r\nparties with booming of cannon and expressions of joy. Throughout all\r\nthe delays and vexations of this wonderful enterprise, DeWitt Clinton\r\nhad been the great inspiring force, and, although for several years\r\nthe board of canal commissioners had been reorganised in the interest\r\nof the Bucktails, not a whisper was heard intimating any desire or\r\nintention to interfere with him. When it was known, however, that\r\nJames Tallmadge had been agreed upon as the candidate of the People's\r\nparty for governor, the Regency, in order to split his forces,\r\ndetermined upon Clinton's removal from all participation in the\r\nmanagement of the canal. If Tallmadge voted for such a resolution,\r\nreasoned the Van Buren leaders, it would alienate the political\r\nfriends with whom he was just now acting; if he voted against it, he\r\nwould alienate Tammany.\r\n\r\nIt was a bold game of politics, and a dangerous one. The people did\r\nnot love Clinton, but they believed in his policy, and a blow at him,\r\nin their opinion, was a blow at the canal. Nothing in the whole of Van\r\nBuren's history exhibits a more foolish disregard of public sentiment,\r\nor led to a greater disaster. But the Regency, blinded by its\r\noverwhelming victory at the last election, was prepared to pay a\r\ngambler's price for power, and, in the twinkling of an eye, before the\r\nAssembly knew what had happened, the Senate removed Clinton from the\r\noffice of canal commissioner, only three votes being recorded for him.\r\nThurlow Weed happened to be a witness of the proceeding, and, rushing\r\nto the Assembly chamber, urged Tallmadge to resist its passage through\r\nthe house. \"I knew how bitterly General Tallmadge hated Mr. Clinton,\"\r\nhe says, \"but in a few hurried and emphatic sentences implored him not\r\nto be caught in the trap thus baited for him. I urged him to state\r\nfrankly, in a brief speech, how entirely he was estranged personally\r\nand politically from Mr. Clinton, but to denounce his removal during\r\nthe successful progress of a system of improvement which he had\r\ninaugurated, and which would confer prosperity and wealth upon the\r\npeople and enrich and elevate our State, as an act of vandalism to\r\nwhich he could not consent to be a party. I concluded by assuring him\r\nsolemnly that if he voted for that resolution he could not receive the\r\nnomination for governor.\"[228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 109.]\r\n\r\nBut Tallmadge remained dumb. Gamaliel H. Barstow, formerly a\r\nClintonian, walked out of the chamber. Other old friends showed\r\nindifference. Only Henry Cunningham of Montgomery, entering the\r\nchamber while the clerk was reading the resolution, eloquently\r\ndenounced it. \"When the miserable party strifes shall have passed by,\"\r\nhe said, in conclusion; \"when the political jugglers who now beleaguer\r\nthis capital shall be overwhelmed and forgotten; when the gentle\r\nbreeze shall pass over the tomb of that great man, carrying with it\r\nthe just tribute of honour and praise which is now withheld, the pen\r\nof the future historian will do him justice, and erect to his memory a\r\nmonument of fame as imperishable as the splendid works that owe their\r\norigin to his genius and perseverance.\"[229] One or two others spoke\r\nbriefly in Clinton's behalf, and then the resolution passed--ayes\r\nsixty-four, noes thirty-four. Among the ayes were Tallmadge and\r\nWheaton.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 110.]\r\n\r\nHad Clinton been assassinated, the news could not have produced a\r\ngreater shock. Scarcely had the Assembly adjourned, before the\r\ncitizens of Albany--rushing into the vacant chamber and electing the\r\nold and venerable John Taylor, the former lieutenant-governor, for\r\nchairman--expressed their indignation in denunciatory speeches and\r\nresolutions. In New York City, a committee of twenty-five, headed by\r\nThomas Addis Emmet, called in person upon Clinton to make known the\r\nfeeling of the meeting. Everywhere throughout the State, the removal\r\nawakened a cyclone of resentment, the members who voted for it being\r\nthe storm-centres. At Canandaigua, personal indignities were\r\nthreatened.[230] \"Several members,\" says Weed, \"were hissed as they\r\ncame out of the capitol. Tallmadge received unmistakable evidence, on\r\nhis way through State Street to his lodgings, of the great error he\r\nhad committed. His hotel was filled with citizens, whose rebukes were\r\nloudly heard as he passed through the hall to his apartment, and as he\r\nnervously paced backward and forward in his parlour, 'the victim of\r\nremorse that comes too late,' he perceived both the depth and the\r\ndarkness of the political pit into which he had fallen.\"[231]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: _Ibid._, p. 114.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: _Ibid._, p. 113.]\r\n\r\nImmediately, the tide began setting strongly in favour of Clinton for\r\ngovernor. Clintonian papers urged it, and personal friends wrote and\r\nrode over the State in his interest. Clinton himself became sanguine\r\nof success. \"Tallmadge can scarcely get a vote in his own county,\" he\r\nwrote Post on the 21st of April. \"He is the prince of rascals--if\r\nWheaton does not exceed him.\"[232]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 569. Clinton seems to have taken a particular\r\ndislike to Henry Wheaton. Elsewhere, he writes to Post: \"There is but\r\none opinion about Wheaton, and that is that he is a pitiful\r\nscoundrel.\"--_Ibid._, p. 417.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a sensation long foreseen by those in the Governor's inner\r\ncircle, was about to be sprung. Yates was not a man to be rudely\r\nthrust out of office. He knew he had blundered in opposing an\r\nelectoral law, and he now proposed giving the Legislature another\r\nopportunity to enact one. The Regency did not believe there would be\r\nan extra session, because, as Attorney-General Talcott suggested, the\r\npower to convene the Legislature was a high prerogative, the exercise\r\nof which required more decision and nerve than Yates possessed; but,\r\non the 2nd of June, to the surprise and consternation of the Van Buren\r\nleaders, Yates issued a proclamation reconvening the Legislature on\r\nAugust 2. It was predicated upon the failure of Congress to amend the\r\nConstitution, upon the recent defeat of the electoral bill in the\r\nSenate, and upon the just alarm of the people, that \"their undoubted\r\nright\" of choosing presidential electors would be withheld from them.\r\nVery likely, it afforded the Governor much satisfaction to make this\r\nopen and damaging attack upon the Regency. He had surrendered\r\nindependence if not self-respect, and, in return for his fidelity, had\r\nbeen ruthlessly cast aside for his less faithful rival. Yet his\r\npurpose was more than revenge. Between the Clintonian prejudice\r\nagainst Tallmadge, and the People's party's hatred of Clinton, the\r\nGovernor hoped he might become a compromise candidate at the Utica\r\nconvention. The future, however, had no place for him. He was\r\nridiculed the more by his enemies and dropped into the pit of oblivion\r\nby his former friends. Nothing in his public life, perhaps, became him\r\nso well as his dignified retirement at Schenectady, amid the scenes of\r\nhis youth, where he died at the age of sixty-nine, leaving a place in\r\nhistory not strongly marked.\r\n\r\nYates' extra session lasted four days and did nothing except to snub\r\nthe Governor and give the eloquent Tallmadge, amidst tumultuous\r\napplause from the galleries, an opportunity of annoying the Regency by\r\nkeeping up the popular excitement over a change in the choice of\r\nelectors until the assembling of the Utica convention. As the days\r\npassed, the sentiment for Clinton became stronger and more apparent.\r\nThurlow Weed, travelling over the State in the interest of Tallmadge,\r\nfound Clinton's nomination almost universally demanded, with Tallmadge\r\na favourite for second place. This, the eloquent gentleman\r\nperemptorily refused, until an appeal for harmony, and the suggestion\r\nthat Adams' election might open to him a broader field for usefulness\r\nthan that of being governor, produced the desired change. Probably\r\nTallmadge felt within himself that he was not destined to a great\r\npolitical career. In any case, he finally accepted the offer with\r\nperfect good humour, giving Weed a brief letter consenting to the use\r\nof his name as lieutenant-governor. With this the young journalist\r\narrived at Utica on the morning of convention day.\r\n\r\nThere were one hundred and twenty-two delegates in the convention, of\r\nwhom one-fourth belonged to the People's party. These supported\r\nTallmadge for governor. When they discovered that Tallmadge's vote to\r\nremove Clinton had put him out of the race, they suggested John W.\r\nTaylor; but a delegate from Saratoga produced a letter in which the\r\ndistinguished opponent of the Missouri Compromise declined to become a\r\ncandidate. This left the way open to DeWitt Clinton, and, as he\r\ncarried off the nomination by a large majority, with Tallmadge for\r\nlieutenant-governor by acclamation, many representatives of the\r\nPeople's party walked out of the hall and reorganised another\r\nconvention, resolving to support Tallmadge, but protesting against the\r\nnomination of Clinton--\"a diversion,\" says Weed, \"which was soon\r\nforgotten amid the general and pervading enthusiasm.\"[233]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 120.]\r\n\r\nThe election of governor in 1824 passed into history as one of the\r\nmost stirring ever witnessed in the State. In a fight, Samuel Young\r\nand DeWitt Clinton were at home. They neither asked nor gave quarter.\r\nThere is no record that their fluency or invective did more than add\r\nto the excitement of the campaign; but each was well supplied with\r\nready venom. Young was rhetorical and dramatic--Clinton energetic and\r\nforceful. People, listening to Young, rocked with laughter and\r\nrevelled in applause as he pilloried his opponents, the ferocity of\r\nhis attacks being surpassed only by the eloquence of his periods. With\r\nClinton, speaking was serious business. He lacked the oratorical gift\r\nand the art of concealing the labour of his overwrought and too\r\nelaborate sentences; but his addresses afforded ample evidence of the\r\ncapacity and richness of his mind. In spite of great faults, both\r\ncandidates commanded the loyalty of followers who swelled with pride\r\nbecause of their courage and splendid ability. The confidence of the\r\nRegency and the usual success of Tammany at first made the friends of\r\nClinton unhappy; but as the campaign advanced, Young discovered that\r\nthe Regency, in insisting on the choice of electors by the\r\nLegislature, had given the opposition the most telling cry it could\r\npossibly have found against him; that the popular tumult over\r\nClinton's removal was growing from day to day; and that his opponents\r\nwere banded together against him on many grounds and with many\r\ndifferent purposes. Two weeks before the election, it was evident to\r\nevery one that the Regency was doomed, that Van Buren was\r\ndisconcerted, and that Young was beaten; but no one expected that\r\nClinton's majority would reach sixteen thousand,[234] or that\r\nTallmadge would run thirty-two thousand ahead of Erastus Root. The\r\nannouncement came like a thunderbolt, bringing with it the\r\nintelligence that out of eight senators only two Regency men had been\r\nspared, while, in the Assembly, the opposition had three to one. In\r\nother words, the election of 1822 had been completely reversed.\r\nClinton was again in the saddle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: DeWitt Clinton, 103,452; Samuel Young, 87,093.--_Civil\r\nList, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nSamuel Young's political fortunes never recovered from this encounter\r\nwith the illustrious champion of the canals. He was much in office\r\nafterward. For eight years he served in the State Senate, and once as\r\nlieutenant-governor; for a quarter of a century he lived on, a\r\nmarvellous orator, whom the people never tired of hearing, and whom\r\nopponents never ceased to fear; but the glow that lingers about a\r\npublic man who had never been overwhelmed by the suffrage of his\r\nfellow-citizens was gone forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nVAN BUREN ENCOUNTERS WEED\r\n\r\n1824\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical interest, in 1824, centred in the election of a President as\r\nwell as a Governor. Three candidates,--William H. Crawford of Georgia,\r\nJohn Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, and Henry Clay of Kentucky,--divided\r\nthe parties in New York. No one thought of DeWitt Clinton. Very\r\nlikely, after his overwhelming election, Clinton, in his joy, felt his\r\nambition again aroused. He had been inoculated with presidential\r\nrabies in 1812, and his letters to Henry Post showed signs of\r\ncontinued madness. \"I think Crawford is _hors de combat_,\" he wrote in\r\nMarch, 1824. \"Calhoun never had force, and Clay is equally out of the\r\nquestion. As for Adams, he can only succeed by the imbecility of his\r\nopponents, not by his own strength. In this crisis may not some other\r\nperson bear away the palm?\"[235] Then follows the historic\r\nillustration, indicating that the canal champion thought he might\r\nbecome a compromise candidate: \"Do you recollect the story of\r\nThemistocles the Athenian? After the naval victory of Salamis a\r\ncouncil of generals was held to determine on the most worthy. Each man\r\nwas to write down two names, the first and the next best. Each general\r\nwrote his own name for the first, and that of Themistocles for the\r\nsecond. May not this contest have a similar result? I am persuaded\r\nthat with common prudence we will stand better than ever.\"[236]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 568.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: _Ibid._, Vol. 50, p. 586.]\r\n\r\nBut the field was preoccupied and the competitors too numerous. So,\r\ngetting no encouragement, Clinton turned to the hero of New Orleans.\r\n\"In Jackson,\" he wrote Post, \"we must look for a sincere and honest\r\nfriend. Whatever demonstrations are made from other quarters are\r\ndictated by policy and public sentiment.\"[237] He grows impatient with\r\nClay, indignant at the apparent success of Adams, and vituperative\r\nover the tactics of Calhoun. \"Clay ought to resign forthwith,\" he\r\nwrites on the 17th of April, 1824; \"his chance is worse than nothing.\r\nJackson would then prevail with all the Western States, if we can get\r\nNew Jersey.\"[238] Four days later he was sure of New Jersey. \"We can\r\nget her,\" he assures Post, on April 21. \"I see no terrors in Adams'\r\npapers; his influence has gone with his morals.\"[239]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: DeWitt Clinton's Letters to Henry Post, in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, Vol. 50, p. 568.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: _Ibid._, p. 568.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: _Ibid._, p. 569.]\r\n\r\nBut by midsummer Clinton had become alarmed at the action of the\r\ncandidate from South Carolina. \"Calhoun is acting a treacherous part\r\nto Jackson,\" he says, under date of July 23, \"and is doing all he can\r\nfor Adams. Perhaps there is not a man in the United States more\r\nhollow-headed and base. I have long observed his manoeuvres.\"[240] A\r\nweek later Clinton speaks of Calhoun as \"a thorough-paced political\r\nblackleg.\"[241] In August he gives Adams another slap. \"The great\r\ndanger is that there will be a quarrel between the friends of Jackson\r\nand Adams, and that in the war between the lion and the unicorn the\r\ncur may slip in and carry off the prize.\"[242]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: _Ibid._, p. 569.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: _Ibid._, p. 569.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: _Ibid._, p. 569.\r\n\r\n\"Clinton's presidential aspirations made him a very censorious judge\r\nof all who did not sympathise with them. The four competing\r\ncandidates, Crawford, Clay, Calhoun, and Adams, could hardly be\r\nparalleled, Clinton being judge, by an equal number of the twelve\r\nCæsars of Suetonius. Crawford is 'as hardened a ruffian as Burr';\r\nCalhoun is 'treacherous', and 'a thorough-paced political blackleg.'\r\nAdams 'in politics was an apostate, and in private life a pedagogue,\r\nand everything but amiable and honest', while his father, the\r\nex-President, was 'a scamp.' Governor Yates is 'perfidious and weak.'\r\nHenry Wheaton's 'conduct is shamefully disgraceful, and he might be\r\nlashed naked round the world.' Chief Justice Ambrose Spencer is\r\nclassed as a minus quantity, and his son John C., 'the political\r\nmillstone of the West.' Peter B. Porter 'wears a mask.' Woodworth 'is\r\na weak man, with sinister purposes.' Root is 'a bad man.' Samuel Young\r\n'is unpopular and suspicions are entertained of his integrity.' Van\r\nBuren 'is the prince of villains.' The first impression produced is\r\none of astonishment that a man capable of such great things could ever\r\nhave taken such a lively interest, as he seemed to, in the mere\r\nscullionery of politics.\"--John Bigelow, in _Harper's Magazine_,\r\nMarch, 1875.]\r\n\r\nThough Clinton and Jackson had long been admirers, there is no\r\nevidence that, at this time, so much as a letter had passed between\r\nthem. One can easily understand, however, that a man of the iron will\r\nand great achievement of the Tennesseean would profoundly interest\r\nDeWitt Clinton. On the other hand, the proud, aspiring, unpliant man\r\nwhose canal policy brought national renown, had won the admiration of\r\nAndrew Jackson. In 1818, at a Nashville banquet, he had toasted\r\nClinton, declaring him \"the promoter of his country's best interests;\"\r\nand one year later, at a dinner given in his honour by the mayor of\r\nNew York, Jackson confounded most of the Bucktail banqueters and\r\nsurprised them all by proposing \"DeWitt Clinton, the enlightened\r\nstatesman and governor of the great and patriotic State of New York.\"\r\nThe two men had many characteristics in common. Neither would stoop to\r\nconquer. But the dramatic thing about Clinton's interest just now, was\r\nhis proclamation for Jackson, when everybody else in New York was for\r\nsome other candidate. The bitterness of that hour was very earnest.\r\nWhatever chance existed for Jackson outside of the State, there was\r\nnot the slightest hope for him within it. Nevertheless, Clinton seemed\r\nindifferent. He was a statesman without being a politician. He\r\nbelieved in Jackson's star, and it was this prescience, as the sequel\r\nshowed, that was to give him, in spite of opponents, a sixth term as\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nClinton's résumé of the political situation, written to Post, also\r\nshowed his unfailing knowledge of the conditions about to be enacted\r\nat Albany. The Legislature which assembled in extra session, in\r\nNovember, 1824, for the appointment of presidential electors, was the\r\nsame Assembly that had favoured the choice of electors by the people,\r\nand the same Senate which had indefinitely postponed that measure by a\r\nvote of seventeen to fourteen. The former struggle, therefore, was\r\nimmediately renewed in the legislative halls, with Martin Van Buren\r\nconfident of seventeen Crawford votes in the Senate, and enough more\r\nin the Assembly, with the help of the Clay men, to give the Georgian a\r\nmajority on joint ballot.\r\n\r\nThe Adams men had less confidence, but no less shrewdness and skill. A\r\nnew Richmond had arrived on the field. Since his visitation through\r\nthe State two years before, in behalf of Solomon Southwick's candidacy\r\nfor governor, Thurlow Weed had been growing rapidly in political\r\nexperience. He left Manlius without a penny in the autumn of 1822 to\r\nfind work on the Rochester _Telegraph_, a Clintonian paper of small\r\npretensions and smaller circulation. Under its new manager, and with\r\nthe name of John Quincy Adams for President at the head of the\r\neditorial page, it soon became so popular and belligerent that the\r\nbusiness men of Rochester sent Weed to Albany as their agent to secure\r\nfrom the Legislature a charter for a bank. Upon his arrival at the\r\ncapital, the friends of the New England candidate welcomed him to the\r\ngreat political arena in which he was to fight so long, so\r\nbrilliantly, and with such success.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period in his history, that Thurlow Weed's connection\r\nwith public life began, developing into that wonderful career which\r\nmade him one of the most influential writers and strongest\r\npersonalities of his day. He was not an orator; he was not even a\r\npublic talker. One attempt to speak met with failure so embarrassing\r\nthat he never tried a second time; but he was a companionable being.\r\nHe loved the company of men. He had suffered so much, and yet retained\r\nso much of the serenity of a child, that he was ever ready to share\r\nhis purse and his mantle of pity with the unfortunate, brightening\r\ntheir lives with a tender sympathy that endeared him to all. It was so\r\nnatural for him to guide wisely and noiselessly that he seemed\r\nunconscious of his great gifts. Men in high places, often opulent and\r\nhappy in their ease, deferred to him with the confidence of pupils to\r\na beloved teacher. But he possessed more than philosophic wisdom. He\r\nwas sleepless and tireless. It was his custom to attend political\r\ngatherings in all parts of the State, and to make the acquaintance of\r\nmen in that \"inner circle,\" who controlled the affairs of party and\r\nthe destiny of aspiring statesmen. In 1822 he had toured the State in\r\nthe interest of Solomon Southwick. From April to December, in 1824, he\r\nattended two extra sessions of the Legislature and a meeting of the\r\nElectoral College, besides travelling twice throughout the State in\r\nbehalf of the candidacy of John Quincy Adams. Traversing New York,\r\nover rough roads, before the days of canals and railroads, in the\r\nheavy, lumbering stage coach that took five or six days and nights,\r\nand, in muddy seasons, six days and seven nights of continuous travel,\r\nto go from Albany to Buffalo, made a strenuous life, but Weed's\r\ndevotion to party, and fidelity to men and principles, sent him on his\r\nway with something of the freshness of boyhood still shining on his\r\nface. He had his faults, but they were not of a kind to prevent men\r\nfrom finding him lovable.\r\n\r\nWhen Weed came to Albany, in November, 1824, as the advocate of John\r\nQuincy Adams, the only hope of success was the union of the friends of\r\nClay and Adams, since only two electoral tickets, under the\r\nConstitution, could be voted for. In the Senate, Crawford had\r\nseventeen votes, and Adams and Clay seven each; in the Assembly, the\r\nfirst ballot gave Crawford forty-three, Adams fifty, and Clay\r\nthirty-two. Until some combination was made, therefore, a majority\r\ncould not be obtained for any candidate. To make such an union\r\nrequired fine diplomacy between the Adams and Clay men; for it\r\nappeared that Clay must have at least seven electoral votes from New\r\nYork in order to become one of the three candidates to be voted for in\r\nthe House of Representatives, should the election of President be\r\nthrown into Congress. Fortunately for the Adams men, the Crawford\r\npeople also had their troubles, and to hold two senators in line they\r\nplaced the names of six moderate Clay men on their ticket. Thereupon,\r\nat a secret meeting, the Adams and Clay leaders agreed to support\r\nthirty Adams men and the six Clay men upon the Crawford ticket, the\r\nfriends of Adams promising, if Clay carried Louisiana, to furnish him\r\nthe needed seven votes. Naturally enough, the success of this\r\nprogramme depended upon the utmost secrecy, since their ticket, with\r\nthe help of all the Clay votes that could be mustered, would not\r\nexceed two majority. The better to secure such secrecy Weed personally\r\nprinted the ballots on the Sunday before the final vote on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThere was another well-kept secret. Thurlow Weed had had his\r\nsuspicions turned into absolute evidence that Henry Eckford of New\r\nYork City, a wealthy supporter of Crawford, had furnished money to\r\ninfluence three Adams men to vote for the Georgian. He had followed\r\ntheir go-between from Syracuse to Albany, from Albany to New York, and\r\nfrom New York back to Albany; he had heard their renunciation of Adams\r\nand their changed sentiments toward Crawford; and he knew also that\r\nthe Adams ticket was lost if these three votes, or even two of them,\r\nwere cast for the Crawford ticket. Weed straightway proposed that the\r\ndishonourable purposes of these men should be anticipated by an\r\nimmediate declaration of war; and, upon their appearance in Albany,\r\nHenry Wheaton faced them with the story of their dishonour,\r\nthreatening an exposure unless they voted a ballot bearing the\r\ninitials of himself and Tallmadge. Conscious of their guilty purposes,\r\nthe timid souls consented to Wheaton's proposition and then kept their\r\npledges.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Van Buren's confidence in the weakness of the\r\nAdams-Clay men was never for a moment shaken. Of the thirty-nine Clay\r\nsupporters in the Legislature, Crawford only needed sixteen; and\r\nthese, Samuel Young and his Clay friends, had promised to deliver.\r\nThere is no evidence that Van Buren had any knowledge of Weed's\r\nmanagement at this time; it so happened, by design or by accident,\r\nthat in their long careers they never met but once, and then, not\r\nuntil after Van Buren had retired from the White House. But the\r\nSenator knew that some hand had struck him, and struck him hard, when\r\nLieutenant-Governor Root drew from the box the first union ballot.\r\nInstead of reading it, Root involuntarily exclaimed, \"A printed split\r\nticket.\" Thereupon Senator Keyes of Jefferson County, sprang to his\r\nfeet, and, in a loud voice, shouted, \"Treason, by God!\" In the\r\nconfusion, Root was about to vacate the speaker's chair and return\r\nwith the senators to their chamber, when James Tallmadge, in a\r\nstentorian voice, called for order. \"I demand, under the authority of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States,\" he said, \"under the\r\nConstitution of the State of New York, in the name of the whole\r\nAmerican people, that this joint meeting of the two houses of the\r\nLegislature shall not be interrupted in the discharge of a high duty\r\nand a sacred trust.\"[243] This settled it. The count went on, but, so\r\nnearly were the parties divided that only thirty-two electors, and\r\nthese on the union ticket, received votes enough to elect them. On the\r\nsecond ballot, four Crawford electors were chosen. \"Had our secret\r\ntranspired before the first ballot,\" says Weed, \"such was the power of\r\nthe Regency over two or three timid men, that the whole Crawford\r\nticket would have been elected.\"[244]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: _Ibid._, p. 127.]\r\n\r\nWriting without full information of the agreement made in the secret\r\ncaucus, Hammond[245] intimates that the Adams men did not keep faith\r\nwith the Clay men, since the four votes taken from Clay and given to\r\nCrawford on the second ballot made Crawford, instead of Clay, a\r\ncandidate in the national House of Representatives. Other writers have\r\nfollowed this opinion, charging the Adams managers with having played\r\nfoul with the Kentucky statesman. But Weed and his associates did\r\nnothing of the kind. The agreement was that Clay should have seven\r\nelectoral votes from New York, provided he carried Louisiana, but as\r\nJackson carried that State, it left the Adams men free to give all\r\ntheir votes to the New Englander. What would have happened had Clay\r\ncarried Louisiana is not so clear, for Weed admits that up to the time\r\nnews came that Louisiana had gone for Jackson, he was unable to find a\r\nsingle Adams elector who would consent to vote for Clay, even to save\r\nhis friends and his party from dishonour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, p.\r\n177.]\r\n\r\nThe failure of the people to elect a President in 1824, and the choice\r\nof John Quincy Adams by the House of Representatives, are among the\r\nmost widely known events in our political history. New York remained,\r\nthroughout, the storm-centre of excitement. After a large majority of\r\nits presidential electors had declared for Adams, thus throwing the\r\nelection into Congress, the result still depended upon the vote of its\r\nclosely divided delegation in the House. Of the thirty-four\r\ncongressmen, seventeen favoured Adams, sixteen opposed him, and\r\nStephen Van Rensselaer was doubtful. The latter's action, therefore,\r\nbecame of the utmost importance, since, if he voted against Adams, it\r\nwould tie the New York delegation and exclude it from the count, thus\r\ngiving Adams twelve States instead of the necessary thirteen, and\r\nmaking his election on a second ballot even more doubtful. This\r\ncondition revived the hopes of Van Buren and gave Clinton a chance to\r\nwork for Jackson.\r\n\r\nStephen Van Rensselaer,[246] born in 1764, had had a conspicuous and\r\nin some respects a distinguished career. He was the fifth in lineal\r\ndescent from Killian van Rensselaer, the wealthy pearl merchant of\r\nAmsterdam, known as the first Patroon, whose great manor, purchased in\r\nthe early part of the seventeenth century, originally included the\r\npresent counties of Albany, Rensselaer, and Columbia. Stephen\r\ninherited the larger part of this territory, and, with it, the old\r\nmanor house at Albany. His mother was a daughter of Philip Livingston,\r\na signer of the Declaration of Independence, and his wife a daughter\r\nof Philip Schuyler. This made him the brother-in-law of Alexander\r\nHamilton.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: Thurlow Weed, in his _Autobiography_, says (p. 461):\r\n\"Of his estimable private character, and of the bounties and blessings\r\nhe scattered in all directions, or of the pervading atmosphere of\r\nhappiness and gratitude that his lifelong goodness created, I need not\r\nspeak, for they are widely known and well remembered.\"]\r\n\r\nStephen began filling offices as soon as he was old enough. For\r\nseveral years he served in the Assembly and in the Senate. In 1795, he\r\nbecame lieutenant-governor for two terms. George Clinton defeated him\r\nfor governor in 1801; but before Jay's term expired, he made him\r\ncommander of the State's cavalry. In 1812, at the outbreak of\r\nhostilities with England, Governor Tompkins promoted him to be chief\r\nof the state militia--an office which he resigned in disgust after the\r\ndisgraceful defeat at Queenstown Heights on the Niagara frontier,\r\nbecause his troops refused to follow him. In 1810, he became a member\r\nof the first canal commission, of which he was president for fifteen\r\nyears. Later, he served as a regent and chancellor of the State\r\nUniversity, and, in 1824, established the Troy Polytechnical\r\nInstitute. It was at this time he went to Congress, and while serving\r\nhis first term, held the casting vote that would elect a President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nRensselaer had been a Federalist of the Hamilton school, and, although\r\nthe Federal party had practically ceased to exist, he owed his\r\nelection to its former members. This was sufficient reason to believe\r\nthat he would not support Van Buren's candidate, and that his\r\npredilections would incline him to take a President from the North,\r\nprovided Adams was _persona grata_ to the old Federalists. The latter\r\nhad never quite forgiven Adams for deserting them; and, having been\r\nlong excluded from power, they were anxious to know whether, if\r\nelected, he would continue to proscribe them. Finally, when Daniel\r\nWebster removed their doubts on this subject, Van Rensselaer still\r\nhesitated on account of Clinton. He had a strong liking for the\r\nGovernor. They had served as canal commissioners, and their\r\nassociation in the great work, then nearing completion, filled him\r\nwith admiration for the indomitable spirit exhibited by the\r\ndistinguished canal builder. His probable action, therefore, kept men\r\nbusy guessing. The suspense resembled that of the Tilden Hayes\r\ncontroversy of 1877, for the result meant much to the several factions\r\nin the State. Crawford's election would continue Van Buren and the\r\nRegency in power; the choice of Jackson must make Clinton the supreme\r\ndispenser of federal patronage; and Adams' success meant a better\r\nopportunity for Thurlow Weed to form a new party.\r\n\r\nVan Rensselaer did not talk. Experience had accustomed him to outside\r\npressure, and he now kept his head cool when Clinton and other\r\ninfluential New Yorkers overwhelmed him with prayers and petitions. At\r\nlast, on the morning of February 9, 1825, he walked leisurely into the\r\nhall of the House and took his seat with the New York delegation.\r\nEvery member of the House was in his place, except one who was sick in\r\nhis lodgings. The galleries were packed with spectators, and the areas\r\nthronged with judges, ambassadors, governors, and other privileged\r\npersons. After the formal announcement, that no one had received a\r\nmajority of electoral votes for the Presidency, and that the House of\r\nRepresentatives must elect a President from the three highest\r\ncandidates, the roll was called by States, and the vote of each State\r\ndeposited in a box by itself. Then the tellers, Daniel Webster and\r\nJohn Randolph, opened the boxes and counted the ballots.\r\n\r\nThe report of the tellers surprised almost every one. A long contest\r\nhad been expected. Friends of Crawford hoped the House would weary\r\nitself with many ballots and end the affair by electing him. But the\r\nannouncement gave Crawford only four States, Jackson seven, and Adams\r\nthirteen--a majority over all. Then it was known that Van Rensselaer's\r\nvote had given New York to Adams, and that New York's vote had made\r\nAdams the President. For the moment, Van Buren was checkmated, and he\r\nknew it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nCLINTON'S COALITION WITH VAN BUREN\r\n\r\n1825-1828\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election of John Quincy Adams as President of the United States\r\nstaggered the Regency and seriously threatened the influence of Martin\r\nVan Buren. It was likely to close the portals of the White House to\r\nhim, and to open the doors of custom-houses and post-offices to his\r\nopponents. More injurious than this, it established new party\r\nalignments and gave great prestige at least to one man before\r\nunrecognised as a political factor. The successful combination of the\r\nAdams and Clay electors was the talk of the State; and, although\r\nThurlow Weed's dominant part in the game did not appear on the\r\nsurface, Van Buren and every intelligent political worker understood\r\nthat some strong hand had been at work.\r\n\r\nThe absence of available candidates, around whom he could rally his\r\nshattered forces, cast the deepest shadow across Van Buren's pathway.\r\nHe had staked much upon Samuel Young's candidacy for governor, and\r\neverything upon William H. Crawford's candidacy for President. But\r\nYoung fell under Clinton's overwhelming majority, and Crawford\r\nexhibited a weakness that surprised even his inveterate opponents. In\r\nthe House of Representatives Crawford had carried but four out of the\r\ntwenty-four States. This seemed to leave Van Buren without a man to\r\nturn to; while Clinton's early declaration for Andrew Jackson gave him\r\nthe key to the situation. Although Jackson, for whom eleven States had\r\ngiven an electoral plurality, received the vote of but seven States in\r\nthe House, the contest had narrowed to a choice between Adams and\r\nhimself, making the popular General the coming man. Besides, Clinton\r\nwas very active on his own account. On the 26th of October, 1825, the\r\nwaters of Lake Erie were let into the Erie canal, and navigation\r\nopened from the lake to the Hudson. It was a great day for the\r\nGovernor. A popular jubilation extended from Buffalo to New York, and,\r\namidst the roar of artillery and the eloquence of many orators, the\r\npraises of the distinguished canal builder sounded throughout the\r\nState and nation. To a man of intellect far lower than that of Martin\r\nVan Buren, it must have been obvious that forces were at work in the\r\nminds and hearts of people which could not be controlled by Regency\r\nedicts or party traditions.\r\n\r\nBut the Kinderhook statesman did not despair. In the election to occur\r\nin November he desired simply to strengthen himself in the\r\nLegislature; and, with consummate skill, he sought to carry Republican\r\ndistricts. National issues were to be avoided. So ably did Edwin\r\nCroswell, the wise and sagacious editor of the Albany _Argus_, lead\r\nthe way, that not a word was written or spoken against the national\r\nadministration. This cunning play renewed the old charge of\r\n\"non-committalism,\"[247] which for many years was used to\r\ncharacterise Van Buren's policy and action; but it in no wise\r\ndisconcerted his plans, or discovered his intentions. All he wanted\r\nnow was the Legislature, and while the whole State was given up to\r\ngeneral rejoicing over the completion of the canal, the Regency\r\nleaders, under the direction of the astute Senator, practised the\r\ntactics which Van Buren had learned from Aaron Burr, and which have\r\ncome to be known in later days as a \"political still-hunt.\" When the\r\ncontest ended, the Regency Republicans had both branches of the\r\nLegislature by a safe working majority. This result, so overwhelming,\r\nso sudden, and so entirely unexpected, made Clinton's friends believe\r\nthat his end had come.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: \"'I heard a great deal about Mr. Van Buren,' said\r\nAndrew Jackson, who occupied a seat in the United States Senate with\r\nhim, 'especially about his non-committalism. I made up my mind that I\r\nwould take an early opportunity to hear him and judge for myself. One\r\nday an important subject was under debate. I noticed that Mr. Van\r\nBuren was taking notes while one of the senators was speaking. I\r\njudged from this that he intended to reply, and I determined to be in\r\nmy seat when he spoke. His turn came; and he arose and made a clear,\r\nstraightforward argument, which, to my mind, disposed of the whole\r\nsubject. I turned to my colleague, Major Seaton, who sat next to me.\r\n'Major,' I said, 'is there anything non-committal about that?' 'No,\r\nsir,' said the Major.\"--Edward M. Shepard, _Life of Martin Van Buren_,\r\np. 151.\r\n\r\n\"In Van Buren's senatorial speeches there is nothing to justify the\r\ncharge of 'non-committalism' so much made against him. When he spoke\r\nat all he spoke explicitly; and he plainly, though without acerbity,\r\nexhibited his likes and dislikes. Van Buren scrupulously observed the\r\namenities of debate. He was uniformly courteous towards adversaries;\r\nand the calm self-control saved him, as some great orators were not\r\nsaved, from a descent to the aspersion of motive so common and futile\r\nin political debate.\"--_Ibid._, p. 152.]\r\n\r\nVan Buren, however, had broader views. He knew that Andrew Jackson, as\r\na candidate for the Presidency, had little standing in 1824 until\r\nPennsylvania took him up, and he now believed that if New York\r\nsupported him, with the Keystone State, in 1828, the hero of New\r\nOrleans must succeed Adams. To elect him President, therefore, became\r\nthe purpose of Van Buren's political life; and, as the first step in\r\nthat direction, he determined to make DeWitt Clinton his friend. The\r\nGovernor was Jackson's champion. He had declared for him in the early\r\ndays of the Tennesseean's candidacy, and to reach him through such an\r\noutspoken ally would give Van Buren an open way to the hero's heart.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Van Buren insisted upon a conciliatory course. He sent\r\nBenjamin Knower, the state treasurer and now a member of the Regency,\r\nto inform Clinton that, if the Van Buren leaders could control their\r\nparty, he should have no opposition at next year's gubernatorial\r\nelection. Clinton and Bucktail, like oil and water, had refused to\r\ncombine until this third ingredient, that Van Buren knew so well how\r\nto add, completed the mixture. Whether the coalition would have\r\nbrought Clinton the reward of success or the penalty of failure must\r\nforever remain a secret, for the Governor did not live long enough to\r\nsolve the question. But in the game of politics he had never been a\r\nmatch for Van Buren. He was a statesman without being a politician.\r\n\r\nJust now, however, Clinton and Van Buren, like lovers who had\r\nquarrelled and made up, could not be too responsive to each other's\r\nwishes. To confirm the latter's good intentions, the Regency senators\r\npromptly approved Clinton's nomination of Samuel Jones for chancellor\r\nin place of Nathan Sanford, who was now chosen United States senator\r\nto succeed Rufus King. It was bitter experience. The appointment\r\nrudely ignored the rule, uniformly and wisely adhered to since the\r\nformation of a state government, to promote the chief justice.\r\n\r\nBesides, Jones had been a pronounced Federalist for a quarter of a\r\ncentury. Moreover, he was a relative of the Governor's wife, and to\r\nsome men, even in that day, nepotism was an offence. But he was an\r\neminent lawyer, the son of the distinguished first comptroller, and to\r\nmake their consideration of the Governor's wishes more evident, the\r\nsenators confirmed the nomination without sending it to a committee.\r\n\r\nA more remarkable illustration of Van Buren's conciliatory policy\r\noccurred in the confirmation of James McKnown as recorder of Albany.\r\nMcKnown was a bitter Clintonian. It was he who, at the Albany meeting,\r\nso eloquently protested against the removal of Clinton as a canal\r\ncommissioner, denouncing it as \"the offspring of that malignant and\r\ninsatiable spirit of political proscription which has already so\r\ndeeply stained the annals of the State,\" and the perpetrators as\r\n\"utterly unworthy of public confidence.\"[248] But the Senate confirmed\r\nhim without a dissenting vote. Later, when a vacancy occurred in the\r\njudgeship of the eighth circuit by the resignation of William B.\r\nRochester, it seemed for a time as if the coalition must break. The\r\nRegency wanted Herman J. Redfield, one of the seventeen senators whose\r\nopposition to the electoral bill had caused his defeat; but the eighth\r\ndistrict was Clinton's stronghold, and if he nominated Redfield, the\r\nGovernor argued, it would deprive him of strength and prestige, and\r\nseriously weaken the cause of Jackson. The Regency, accustomed to\r\nremain faithful to the men who incurred popular odium for being\r\nfaithful to them, found it difficult, either to reconcile the\r\nconditions with their wishes, or to compromise upon any one else.\r\nNevertheless, on the last day of the session, through the active and\r\njudicious agency of Benjamin Knower, John Birdsall of Chautauqua\r\nCounty, a friend of Clinton, was nominated and confirmed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n2, p. 164.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Van Buren had returned to his seat in Congress. He\r\nentered the United States Senate in 1821, and, although observing the\r\ndecorum expected of a new member of that body, he displayed powers of\r\nmind that distinguished him as a senator of more than ordinary\r\nability. He now became a parliamentary orator, putting himself at the\r\nhead of an anti-Administration faction, and developing the tact and\r\nmanagement of a great parliamentary leader. He had made up his mind\r\nthat nothing less than a large and comprehensive difference between\r\nthe two wings of the Republican party would be of any real use; so he\r\narraigned the Administration, with great violence, as un-Republican\r\nand Federalistic. He took a definite stand against internal\r\nimprovements by the United States government; he led the opposition to\r\nthe appointment of American representatives to the Congress of Panama,\r\ntreating the proposed mission as unconstitutional and dangerous; and\r\nhe charged the Administration with returning to the practices of the\r\nFederalist party, to which Adams originally belonged, declaring that\r\nthe presidential choice of 1825 was not only the restoration of the\r\nmen of 1798, but of the principles of that day; that the spirit of\r\nencroachment had become more wary, but not more honest; and that the\r\nsystem then was coercion, now it was seduction. He classed the famous\r\nalien and sedition laws, of the elder Adams, with the bold avowal of\r\nthe younger Adams that it belonged to the President alone to decide\r\nupon the propriety of a foreign mission. Thus, he associated the\r\nadministration of John Quincy Adams with the administration of his\r\nfather, insisting that if the earlier one deserved the retribution of\r\na Republican victory, the latter one deserved a similar fate.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's language had the courteous dignity that uniformly\r\ncharacterised his speeches. He charged no personal wrong-doing; he\r\ninsinuated no base motives; he rejected the unfounded story of the\r\nsale of the Presidency to Adams; he voted for Clay's confirmation as\r\nsecretary of state, and, as a member of the senatorial committee, he\r\nwelcomed the new President upon his inauguration; but from the moment\r\nJohn Quincy Adams became President, the Senator from New York led the\r\nopposition to his administration with the astuteness of a great\r\nparliamentary leader, determined to create a new party in American\r\npolitics. Van Buren also had some strong allies. With him, voted\r\nFindlay of Pennsylvania, Holmes of Maine, Woodbury of New Hampshire,\r\nDickerson of New Jersey, and Kane of Illinois, besides twelve Southern\r\nsenators. But, from the outset, he was the leader. His speeches,\r\nsmooth and seldom impassioned, were addressed to the intellect rather\r\nthan to the feelings. He was the master of the art of making a\r\nperfectly clear statement of the most complicated case, and of\r\ndefending his measures, point by point, with never-failing readiness\r\nand skill throughout the most perplexing series of debates. He talked\r\nto make converts, appealing to his colleagues with a directness well\r\ncalculated to bring to his side a majority of the waverers.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's opposition to the Adams administration has been called\r\nfactious and unpatriotic. It was certainly active and continuous, and,\r\nperhaps, now and then, somewhat more unscrupulous than senatorial\r\nopposition is in our own time; but his policy was, unquestionably, the\r\npolicy of more modern political parties. His tactics created an\r\norganisation which, inside and outside of the Senate, was to work\r\nunceasingly, with tongue and pen, to discredit everything done by the\r\nmen in office and to turn public opinion against them. It was a part\r\nof his plan not only to watch with jealous care all the acts of the\r\nAdministration, but to make the most of every opportunity that could\r\nbe used to turn them out of office; and when the Senate debate ended,\r\nthe modern Democratic party had been formed. Adams recorded in his now\r\nfamous diary that Van Buren made \"a great effort to combine the\r\ndiscordant elements of the Crawford and Jackson and Calhoun men into a\r\nunited opposition against the Administration.\" He might have added,\r\nalso, that the debate distinctly marked Van Buren's position in\r\nhistory as a party-maker in the second great division of parties in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's coalition with DeWitt Clinton, however, came perilously\r\nnear prostrating them both. At their state convention, held at Utica,\r\nin September, 1826, the Clintonians and the People's party renominated\r\nClinton for governor. In the following month, the Bucktails met at\r\nHerkimer, and, if Van Buren could have had his way, the convention\r\nwould have indorsed Clinton. Finding such action inadvisable, however,\r\nVan Buren secured the nomination of William B. Rochester, on the\r\ntheory that he was a good enough candidate to be beaten. Rochester was\r\nnot a man of marked ability. He had done nothing to make himself known\r\nthroughout the State; he did not even favour a state road through the\r\nsouthern tier of counties. He was simply a lawyer of fair attainments\r\nwho had served a term in the Legislature, one in Congress, and two\r\nyears as a circuit judge, a position from which he resigned, in 1825,\r\nto become minister to Panama.\r\n\r\nBut Rochester proved vastly more formidable as a candidate for\r\ngovernor than the Van Buren leaders anticipated. It became well known\r\nthat he was a supporter of the Adams administration, and that Henry\r\nClay regarded him with favour. Indeed, it was through the latter's\r\npersonal and political friendship that he secured the mission to\r\nPanama. Thus, the feeling began to obtain that Rochester, although\r\nthe nominee of the Regency party, more nearly represented the\r\ninterests and principles of the Adams administration than DeWitt\r\nClinton, an avowed Jackson man, who had formed a coalition with Van\r\nBuren. For this reason, Peter B. Porter, an ardent admirer of Clay,\r\nand now a member of the People's party, entered with spirit into the\r\ncampaign, appealing to the Clintonians, a large majority of whom\r\nfavoured Adams, to resent Clinton's deal with Jackson's friends, and\r\nvote for Rochester, whose election would insure the success of the\r\nPresident, and bring credit to the people of the western counties,\r\nalready ambitious to give the State a governor. This potent appeal was\r\ntaken up throughout the State, influencing many Clintonians to support\r\nRochester, and holding in line scores of Bucktails who favoured Adams.\r\n\r\nIt was a critical moment for Van Buren. He was not only a candidate\r\nfor re-election to the United States Senate, but he had staked all\r\nupon the overthrow of the Adams administration. Yet, the election of\r\nhis party's candidate for governor would in all probability overthrow\r\nthe Clinton-Van Buren coalition, giving the vote of the State to the\r\nPresident, and possibly defeat his own re-election. It was a singular\r\npolitical mix-up.\r\n\r\nVan Buren had hoped to exclude from the campaign all national issues,\r\nas he succeeded in doing the year before. But the friends of Clay and\r\nAdams could not be hoodwinked. The canvass also developed combinations\r\nthat began telling hard upon Van Buren's party loyalty. Mordecai M.\r\nNoah, an ardent supporter of Van Buren, and editor of the New York\r\n_Enquirer_, came out openly for Clinton. For years, Noah had been\r\nClinton's most bitter opponent. He opposed the canal, he ridiculed its\r\nchampion, and he lampooned its supporters; yet he now swallowed the\r\nprejudices of a lifetime and indorsed the man he had formerly\r\ndespised. Van Buren, it may safely be said, was at heart quite as\r\ndevoted a supporter of the Governor, since the latter's re-election\r\nwould be of the greatest advantage to his own personal interests; but\r\nwhatever his defects of character, and however lacking he may have\r\nbeen in an exalted sense of principle, Van Buren appeared to be\r\nsincere in his devotion to Rochester. This was emphasised by the\r\nsupport of the Albany _Argus_ and other leading Regency papers.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the election returns furnished ample grounds for\r\nsuspicion. Steuben County, then a Regency stronghold, gave Clinton\r\nover one thousand majority. Other counties of that section did\r\nproportionately as well. It was explained that this territory would\r\nnaturally support Clinton who had insisted in his message that the\r\ncentral and northern counties, having benefited by the Erie and\r\nChamplain canals, ought to give Steuben and the southern tier a public\r\nhighway. But William B. Rochester went to his watery grave[249]\r\nthirteen years afterward with the belief that Van Buren and his\r\nconfidential friends did not act in good faith.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: Rochester was lost off the coast of North Carolina, on\r\nJune 15, 1838, by the explosion of a boiler on the steamer _Pulaski_,\r\nbound from Charleston to Baltimore. Of 150 passengers only 50\r\nsurvived.]\r\n\r\nWith the help of the state road counties, however, Clinton had a\r\nnarrow escape; the returns gave him only 3650 majority.[250] This\r\nmargin appeared the more wonderful when contrasted with the vote of\r\nNathaniel Pitcher, candidate for lieutenant-governor on the Rochester\r\nticket, who received 4182 majority. \"Clinton luck!\" was the popular\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: Clinton's vote was 99,785--a falling off of 3,667 from\r\n1824, while Rochester's was 96,135, an increase of 9,042 over Young's\r\nvote.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nThe closeness of the result prompted the friends of the President to\r\nfavour Rochester for United States senator to succeed Van Buren, whose\r\nterm expired on March 4, 1827. Several of the Adams assemblymen acted\r\nwith the Regency party, and it was hoped that through them a winning\r\ncombination might be made. But Van Buren had not been sleeping. He\r\nknew his strength, and with confidence he returned to Washington to\r\nrenew his attacks upon the Administration. When, finally, the\r\nelection occurred, he had a larger majority than sanguine friends\r\nanticipated. Three Clintonians in the Senate and two in the Assembly,\r\nrecognising the coalition of Van Buren and Clinton, cast their votes\r\nfor the former. In thanking the members of the Legislature for this\r\nrenewed expression of confidence, Van Buren spoke of the \"gratifying\r\nunanimity\" of their action, declaring that it should be his \"constant\r\nand zealous endeavour to protect the remaining rights reserved to the\r\nStates by the Federal Constitution; to restore those of which they\r\nhave been divested by construction; and to promote the interests and\r\nhonour of our common country.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in much less than two years, Van Buren easily retrieved all, and\r\nmore, than he had lost by the election of Clinton and the defeat of\r\nCrawford. His position was singularly advantageous. Whatever happened,\r\nhe was almost sure to gain. He stood with Clinton, with Jackson, and\r\nwith a party drilled and disciplined better than regular troops. In\r\nhis biography of Andrew Jackson, James Parton says of Van Buren at\r\nthis time: \"His hand was full of cards, and all his cards were\r\ntrumps.\"[251] Andrew Jackson, who had been watching his career, said\r\none day to a young New Yorker: \"I am no politician; but if I were a\r\npolitician, I would be a New York politician.\"[252]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: James Parton, _Life of Andrew Jackson_, Vol. 3, p.\r\n131.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: _Ibid._, p. 136.]\r\n\r\nVan Buren's advantage, however, great as it was, did not end with his\r\nre-election to the United States Senate. One after another, the men\r\nwho stood between him and the object of his ambition had gradually\r\ndisappeared. Ambrose Spencer was no longer on the bench, James\r\nTallmadge had run his political course, and Daniel D. Tompkins was in\r\nhis grave. Only DeWitt Clinton was left, and on February 11, 1828,\r\ndeath very suddenly struck him down. Stalwart in form and tremendous\r\nin will power, few dreamed that he had any malady, much less that\r\ndeath was shadowing him. He was in his fifty-ninth year.\r\n\r\nOf DeWitt Clinton it may fairly be said that \"his mourners were two\r\nhosts--his friends and his foes.\" Everywhere, regardless of party,\r\nmarks of the highest respect and deepest grief were evinced. The\r\nLegislature voted ten thousand dollars to his four minor children, an\r\namount equal to the salary of a canal commissioner during the time he\r\nhad served without pay. Indeed, nothing was left undone or unsaid\r\nwhich would evidence veneration for his memory and sorrow for his\r\nloss. He had lived to complete his work and to enjoy the reward of a\r\ngreat achievement. Usually benefactors of the people are not so\r\nfortunate; their halo, if it comes at all, generally forms long after\r\ndeath. But Clinton seemed to be the creature of timely political\r\naccidents. The presentation of his canal scheme had made him governor\r\non July 1, 1817; and he represented the State when ground was broken\r\nat Rome on July 4; his removal as canal commissioner made him governor\r\nagain in 1825; and he represented the State at the completion of the\r\nwork. On both occasions, he received the homage of the entire people,\r\nnot only as champion of the canal, but as the head of the Commonwealth\r\nfor which he had done so much.\r\n\r\nThere were those who thought the time of his death fortunate for his\r\nfame, since former opponents were softened and former friends had not\r\nfallen away. An impression also obtained that little was left him\r\npolitically to live for. New conditions and new men were springing up.\r\nAs a strict constructionist of the Federal Constitution, with a\r\nleaning toward states' rights, he could not have followed Clintonians\r\ninto the Whig party soon to be formed, nor would he have been at home\r\namong the leaders of the Jackson or new Democratic party, who were\r\nunlikely to have any use for him. He would not be second to Van Buren,\r\nand Van Buren would not suffer him to interfere with the promotion of\r\nhis own career. It is possible Van Buren might have supported him for\r\ngovernor in 1828, but he would have had no hesitation in playing his\r\nown part regardless of him. Had Clinton insisted, so much the worse\r\nfor Clinton. Of the two men, Van Buren possessed the advantage. He had\r\nless genius and possibly less self-reliance, but in other respects--in\r\ntact, in prudence, in self-control, in address--indeed, in everything\r\nthat makes for party leadership, Van Buren easily held the mastery.\r\n\r\nClinton's career was absolutely faultless in two aspects--as an honest\r\nman, and a husband, only praise is due him. He died poor and pure.\r\nYet, there are passages in his history which evidence great defects.\r\nLife had been for him one long dramatic performance. Many great men\r\nseem to have a suit of armour in the form of coldness, brusqueness, or\r\nrudeness, which they put on to meet the stranger, but which, when laid\r\naside, reveals simple, charming, and often boyish manners. Clinton had\r\nsuch an armour, but he never put it off, except with intimates, and\r\nnot then with any revelation of warmth. He was cold and arrogant,\r\nshowing no deference even to seniors, since he denied the existence of\r\nsuperiors. Nobody loved him; few really liked him; and, except for his\r\ncanal policy, his public career must have ended with his dismissal\r\nfrom the New York mayoralty. It seemed a question whether he really\r\nmeasured up to the stature of a statesman.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the judgment of posterity is easily on the side of\r\nClinton's greatness. Thurlow Weed spoke of him as a great man with\r\nweak points; and Van Buren, in his attractive eulogy at Washington,\r\ndeclared that he was \"greatly tempted to envy him his grave with its\r\nhonours.\" He may well have done so; for, although Van Buren reached\r\nthe highest office in the gift of the people, and is clearly one of\r\nthe ablest leaders of men in the history of the Empire State, his fame\r\ndoes not rest on so sure a foundation. Clinton was a man of great\r\nachievement. He was not a dreamer; nor merely a statesman with\r\nimagination, grasping the idea in its bolder outlines; but, like a\r\ncaptain of industry, he combined the statesman and the practical man\r\nof affairs, turning great possibilities into greater realities. It\r\nmay be fairly said of him that his career made an era in the history\r\nof his State, and that in asserting the great principle of internal\r\nimprovements he blazed the way that guided all future comers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nVAN BUREN ELECTED GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n1828\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September, 1827, Van Buren permitted the New York wing of the\r\nRepublican party to come out plainly for Andrew Jackson for President.\r\nThe announcement, made by the general committee, which met in Tammany\r\nHall, declared that the Bucktails reposed full confidence in Andrew\r\nJackson's worth, integrity, and patriotism, and would support only\r\nthose who favoured him for President of the United States.\r\n\r\nPeter B. Sharpe, a Tammany chief of courage, recently speaker of the\r\nAssembly, voiced a faint protest; and later he summoned Marinus\r\nWillett from his retirement to preside at an opposition meeting. It\r\nwas, no doubt, an inspiring sight to see this venerable soldier of the\r\nRevolution, who had won proud distinction in that long and bloody war,\r\npresiding at an assembly of his fellow citizens nearly half a century\r\nafterward; it accentuated the fact that other heroes existed besides\r\nthe victor of New Orleans; but the Van Buren papers spoke in concert.\r\nWithin a week, the whole State understood that the election of 1827\r\nmust be conducted with express reference to the choice of Jackson in\r\n1828.\r\n\r\nThe note of this bugle call, blown by Edwin Croswell, the famous\r\neditor of the Albany _Argus_, resounded the enthusiasm of the party.\r\nThe ablest and most popular men, preliminary to the contest, were\r\nselected for legislative places. Erastus Root was again nominated in\r\nDelaware County; Robert Emmet, the promising son of the distinguished\r\nThomas Addis Emmet, and Ogden Hoffman, the eloquent and brilliant son\r\nof Josiah Ogden Hoffman, who was to become the best criminal lawyer\r\nof his day, found places on the ticket in New York City; Nathaniel P.\r\nTallmadge, heretofore an opponent of the Regency, but now to begin a\r\npublic career which finally placed him in the United States Senate for\r\ntwelve years, was brought out in Dutchess County; and Benjamin F.\r\nButler, whose revision of the state statutes had made him exceedingly\r\npopular, accepted a nomination in the anti-Regency stronghold of\r\nAlbany.\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone in the character or strength of their ticket, the\r\nAdams men summoned their ablest and most eloquent campaigners to share\r\nthe burden of the contest; and Elisha Williams, Peter B. Sharpe,\r\nFrancis Granger, and Peter B. Porter readily responded. Ezra C. Gross,\r\nwho had served a term in Congress, also bore a conspicuous part. Gross\r\nwas rapidly forging to the front, and would doubtless have become one\r\nof the most gifted and brilliant men in the State had he not fallen an\r\nearly victim to intemperance.\r\n\r\nFor a purely local campaign, without the assistance of a state ticket,\r\nit proved a canvass of unusual vehemence, filling the air with\r\ncaricatures and lampoons, and bringing victory to the drilled and\r\ndisciplined forces which were now to follow, for half a score of\r\nyears, the fortunes of the New Orleans hero. From the moment Jackson\r\nbecame the standard-bearer, the crowds were with him. Adams was\r\nrepresented as cold and personally unpopular; Jackson as frank,\r\ncordial in manner, and bravely chivalric. When everything in favour of\r\nAdams was carefully summed up and admitted, his ability as a writer,\r\nas a lawyer, as a diplomatist, and as a statesman, the people,\r\nfascinated by the distinguished traits of character and the splendour\r\nof the victory at New Orleans, threw their hats into the air for\r\nAndrew Jackson. The eloquence of Williams could carry Columbia County;\r\nPorter, ever popular and interesting, could sweep the Niagara\r\nfrontier; and Gross, with an illuminated rhetoric that lives to this\r\nday in the memory of men who heard their fathers talk about it, had no\r\ntrouble in Essex; but from the Hudson to Lake Oneida the Jackson party\r\nmay be said to have carried everything by storm, electing its ticket\r\nby over four thousand majority in New York City, and securing nearly\r\nall the senatorial districts and the larger part of the Assembly. So\r\noverwhelming was the victory that Van Buren had no trouble at the\r\nopening of the Twentieth Congress to defeat the re-election of John W.\r\nTaylor for speaker.\r\n\r\nAs the time approached for nominating a governor to lead the campaign\r\nof 1828, Van Buren realised that the anti-masonic sentiment, which had\r\nbeen rapidly growing since the abduction of William Morgan, had\r\ndeveloped into an influence throughout the western part of the State\r\nthat threatened serious trouble. Morgan was a native of Virginia, born\r\nin 1776, a man of fair education, and by trade a stone-mason. Little\r\nis known of his life until 1821, when he resided first in York,\r\nCanada, and, a year later, in Rochester, New York, where he worked at\r\nhis trade. Then he drifted to LeRoy, in Genesee County, becoming an\r\nactive Free Mason. Afterward, he moved back to Rochester, and then to\r\nBatavia, where he sought out David C. Miller, a printer, who agreed to\r\npublish whatever secrets of Free Masonry Morgan would reveal. The\r\nwork, done by night and on Sundays, was finally interrupted on\r\nSeptember 11, 1826, by Morgan's arrest, on a trifling criminal charge,\r\nand transfer to Canandaigua for examination. His acquittal was\r\nimmediately followed by a second arrest upon a civil process for a\r\nsmall debt and by his imprisonment in the Canandaigua jail. When\r\ndischarged on the succeeding night, he was quickly seized, and, as it\r\nsubsequently appeared from the evidence taken at the trial of his\r\nabductors, he was bound, gagged, thrust violently into a covered\r\ncarriage, driven by a circuitous route, with relays of horses and men,\r\nto Fort Niagara, and left in confinement in the magazine. Here he\r\ndropped out of view.\r\n\r\nThe excitement following the discovery of this crime was without a\r\nparallel in the history of Western New York. Citizens everywhere\r\norganised committees for the apprehension of the offenders; the\r\nGovernor offered a reward for their discovery; the Legislature\r\nauthorised the appointment of able lawyers to investigate; and\r\nWilliam L. Marcy and Samuel Nelson, then judges of the Supreme Court,\r\nwere designated to hold special circuits for the trial of the accused.\r\nMany persons were convicted and punished as aiders and abettors of the\r\nconspiracy. For three years the excitement continued without\r\nabatement, until the whole State west of Syracuse became soaked with\r\ndeep and bitter feeling, dividing families, sundering social ties, and\r\nbreeding lawsuits in vindication of assailed character. Public\r\nsentiment was divided as to whether Morgan had been put to death. Half\r\na century afterward, in 1882, Thurlow Weed published an affidavit,\r\nrehearsing a statement made to him in 1831 by John Whitney, who\r\nconfessed that he was one of five persons who took Morgan from the\r\nmagazine and drowned him in Lake Ontario.[253]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 332.]\r\n\r\nThe trouble stirred up by this unfortunate affair gradually drifted\r\ninto politics. In the spring of 1827, a disinclination had shown\r\nitself among the people of Genesee County to support Free Masons for\r\nsupervisors or justices of the peace, and, although the leading men of\r\nthe western part of the State deprecated political action, the\r\npressure became so great that Free Masons were excluded from local\r\ntickets in certain towns of Genesee and Monroe Counties. This course\r\nwas resented by their friends. In the summer of the same year, the old\r\ntreasurer of Rochester, who had been elected year after year without\r\nopposition, was defeated. No one had openly opposed him, but a canvass\r\nof the returns disclosed a silent vote which was quickly charged to\r\nthe Masons. This discovery, says Thurlow Weed, \"was like a spark of\r\nfire dropped into combustible materials.\" Immediately, Rochester\r\nbecame the centre of anti-Masonry. In September, an anti-masonic\r\nconvention nominated a legislative ticket, which, to the amazement and\r\nconfusion of the old parties, swept Monroe County by a majority of\r\nover seventeen hundred. Direction was thus given to the movement. In\r\nthe following year, when the state and national election was\r\napproaching, it appeared that throughout \"the infected district,\" as\r\nit was called, the opponents of Masonry, although previously about\r\nequally divided in political sentiment, had aligned themselves with\r\nthe Adams party, and that the Masons had affiliated with the followers\r\nof Jackson. There was good reason for this division. The prominent men\r\nin the anti-masonic body, for the most part, were not only leaders of\r\nthe Adams party, but, very early in the excitement, President Adams\r\ntook occasion to let it be known that he was not a Mason. On the other\r\nhand, it was well understood that Jackson was a Mason and gloried in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis was the situation when the Adams followers, who now called\r\nthemselves National Republicans, met in convention at Utica on July\r\n22, 1828. The wise policy of nominating candidates acceptable to all\r\nAnti-Masons was plain, and the delegates from the western half of the\r\nState proposed Francis Granger for governor. Granger was not then a\r\npolitical Anti-Mason, but he was clean, well-known, and popular, and\r\nfor two years had been a leading member of the Assembly. Thurlow Weed\r\nsaid of him that he was \"a gentleman of accomplished manners, genial\r\ntemperament, and fine presence, with fortune, leisure, and a taste for\r\npublic life.\"[254] Indeed, he appears to have felt from the first a\r\ngenuine delight in the vivid struggles of the political arena, and,\r\nalthough destined to be twice beaten for governor, and once for Vice\r\nPresident, he had abundant service in the Cabinet, in the Legislature,\r\nand in Congress. Just then he was thirty-six years old, the leading\r\nantagonist of John C. Spencer at the Canandaigua bar, and one whom\r\neverybody regarded as a master-spirit. Dressed in a bottle-green coat\r\nwith gilt buttons, a model of grace and manhood, he was the attraction\r\nof the ladies' gallery. He had youth, enthusiasm, magnificent gifts,\r\nand a heart to love. All his resources seemed to be at instant\r\ncommand, according as he had need of them. Besides, he was a born\r\nRepublican. Thomas Jefferson had made his father postmaster-general,\r\nand during the thirteen years he held the office, the son was\r\nstudying at Yale and fighting Federalism.[255]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 391.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: Writing of Granger, in January, 1831, Seward says: \"I\r\nbelieve I have never told you all I thought about this star of the\r\nfirst magnitude in Anti-masonry, and the reason was that, with a\r\nlimited personal acquaintance, I might give you erroneous impressions\r\nwhich I should afterward be unable to reverse. He is 'six feet and\r\nwell-proportioned,' as you well know, handsome, graceful, dignified,\r\nand affable, as almost any hero of whom you have read; is probably\r\nabout thirty-six or seven years old. In point of talent he has a quick\r\nand ready apprehension, a good memory, and usually a sound judgment.\r\nHas no 'genius,' in its restricted sense, not a very brilliant\r\nimagination, nor extraordinary reasoning faculties; has no deep store\r\nof learning, nor a very extensive degree of information. Yet he is\r\nintimately acquainted with politics, and with the affairs, interests,\r\nand men of the State. He is never great, but always successful. He\r\nwrites with ease and speaks with fluency and elegance--never attempts\r\nan argument beyond his capacity, and, being a good judge of men's\r\ncharacter, motives, and actions, he never fails to command admiration,\r\nrespect, and esteem. Not a man do I know who is his equal in the skill\r\nof exhibiting every particle of his stores with great advantage. You\r\nwill inquire about his manners. His hair is ever gracefully curled,\r\nhis broad and expansive brow is always exposed, his person is ever\r\ncarefully dressed, to exhibit his face and form aright and with\r\nsuccess. He is a gallant and fashionable man. He seems often to\r\nneglect great matters for small ones, and I have often thought him a\r\ntrifler; yet he is universally, by the common people, esteemed grave\r\nand great. He is an aristocrat in his feelings, though the people who\r\nknow him think him all condescension. He is a prince among those who\r\nare equals, affable to inferiors, and knows no superiors. In principle\r\nhe has redeeming qualities--more than enough to atone for his\r\nfaults--is honest, honourable, and just, first and beyond comparison\r\nwith other politicians of the day. You will ask impatiently, 'Has he a\r\nheart?' Yes. Although he has less than those who do not know him\r\nbelieve him to possess, he has much more than those who meet him\r\nfrequently, but not intimately, will allow him to have. He loves,\r\nesteems, and never forgets his friends; but you must not understand me\r\nthat he possesses as confiding and true a heart as Berdan had, or as\r\nyou think I have, or as we both know Weed has. There is yet one\r\nquality of Granger's character which you do not dream of--he loves\r\nmoney almost as well as power.\"--Frederick W. Seward, _Life of W.H.\r\nSeward_, Vol. 1, p. 171.]\r\n\r\nEastern delegates wanted Smith Thompson. Thompson was a man of great\r\nlearning and an honoured member of the Republican party. But he was\r\nsixty years old. With the exception of five years as secretary of the\r\nnavy, under Monroe, he had been continuously upon the bench for over a\r\nquarter of a century, first as justice and chief justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of the State, latterly as associate justice of the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court. It was suggested, with some pertinency as\r\nit afterward appeared, that the people of the State having declared in\r\nthe recently adopted Constitution, that a judge, holding office during\r\ngood behaviour, ought not to be a candidate for an elective office,\r\nwould resent such a nomination. It was further suggested, with even\r\ngreater force, that Thompson's nomination would offend the ultra\r\nAnti-Masons and bring an independent ticket into the field, thus\r\ndividing the Adams vote and giving the election to the Jackson\r\ncandidate. On the other hand, it was maintained with equal spirit\r\nthat the nomination of Granger, avowedly to secure the anti-masonic\r\nvote, would offend the National Republicans and jeopardise the state\r\nas well as the electoral ticket. It took a ballot to decide the\r\nquestion, and Thompson won by a close vote. Francis Granger was then\r\nnominated for lieutenant-governor by acclamation.\r\n\r\nAs predicted, several ultra anti-masonic editors in Genesee and\r\nOntario counties immediately denounced the nomination of Thompson. The\r\nAdams people knew it portended danger; but Thompson would not withdraw\r\nand the ultras would not relent. Thereupon, the anti-masonic\r\nconvention, already called to meet at Utica, added to the difficulty\r\nof the situation by nominating Francis Granger and John Crary. Granger\r\nhad not solicited nomination, and now he was burdened with two. But\r\nThompson refused to relieve the embarrassment, and Crary proved\r\nwickedly false to his agreement. The latter admitted that the union of\r\nthe Adams and anti-masonic forces would probably elect Granger for\r\nlieutenant-governor, and he promised to withdraw as soon as Granger\r\nshould do so. Upon this Granger declined the anti-masonic nomination;\r\nbut the wily Van Buren, who was intently watching the embarrassment of\r\nthe National Republicans, took good care to have Crary remain and\r\nSolomon Southwick substituted for Granger. The general sentiment of\r\nthe Anti-Masons did not respond to this movement. But the angry\r\nfeeling excited by Granger's declination, aided by Van Buren's\r\nfinesse, gave Southwick, who had acquired some credit with the\r\nAnti-Masons by an early renunciation of his masonic ties, an\r\nopportunity of advancing his visionary projects of personal ambition.\r\nThurlow Weed declared that the people had been \"juggled\" out of a\r\ncandidate for governor; but Weed did not know that Van Buren, needing\r\nmoney to help along the jugglery, wrote James A. Hamilton, the son of\r\nthe great Federalist, that unless \"you do more in New York than you\r\npromised, our friends in Albany, at best poor, will break down.\" Crary\r\nwas one of the assemblymen who, in 1824, had boldly denounced the\r\nremoval of Clinton as a canal commissioner. After his broken promise\r\nto Granger and his bargain with Van Buren, however, he ceased to be\r\ncalled \"Honest John Crary.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the meeting of the National Republican convention, Martin Van\r\nBuren was announced as the Jackson candidate for governor. It was\r\nwell-known, at least to the Albany Regency, that if Jackson became\r\nPresident, Van Buren would be his secretary of state. One can readily\r\nunderstand that Van Buren would willingly exchange the Senate for the\r\nhead of the Cabinet, since the office of secretary of state had been\r\nfor twenty years a certain stepping-stone to the Presidency. Madison\r\nhad been Jefferson's secretary of state, Monroe had filled the exalted\r\nplace under Madison, and John Quincy Adams served Monroe in the same\r\ncapacity. But Van Buren's willingness to exchange the Senate, an arena\r\nin which he had ranked among the ablest statesmen of the Republic, for\r\nthe governorship, was prompted by the force of circumstances and not\r\nby choice. Jackson's election was believed to depend upon New York,\r\nand the carrying of New York, to depend upon Van Buren. The latter, at\r\nthis time, was at the zenith of his popularity. His speeches had not\r\nonly stamped him as a genuine parliamentary debater, but had gained\r\nfor him the reputation of being the congressional leader and chief\r\norganiser of the Jackson party. During his seven and a half years in\r\nthe Senate, his name was associated with every event of importance;\r\nhis voice was heard on one side or the other of every question that\r\ninterested the American people; and the force he brought to bear,\r\nwhether for good or evil, swayed the minds of contemporaries to an\r\nunusual degree.\r\n\r\nVan Buren looked his best in these days. His complexion was a bright\r\nblonde, and he dressed with the taste of Disraeli. Henry B. Stanton\r\ndescribes him as he appeared at church in Rochester on a Sunday during\r\nthe campaign. \"He wore an elegant snuff-colored broadcloth coat with\r\nvelvet collar; his cravat was orange with modest lace tips; his vest\r\nwas of a pearl hue; his trousers were white duck; his silk hose\r\ncorresponded to the vest; his shoes were morocco; his nicely fitting\r\ngloves were yellow kid; his long-furred beaver hat, with broad brim,\r\nwas of Quaker color. As he sat in the wealthy aristocratic church of\r\nthe town, in the pew of General Gould who had been a lifelong\r\nFederalist and supporter of Clinton, all eyes were fixed upon the man\r\nwho held Jackson's fate in his hands.\"[256]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 32.]\r\n\r\nVan Buren did not propose to take any chances, either in securing the\r\nnomination or the election for governor--hence his visit to Rochester\r\nand the western counties to study for himself the anti-masonic\r\nsituation. \"The excitement has been vastly greater than I supposed,\"\r\nhe wrote Hamilton. In order to find some way of pacifying it, he\r\nturned aside to visit the home of his friend, Enos T. Throop, then\r\nliving on the wooded and beautiful banks of Lake Owasco. In January,\r\n1827, Throop, who presided at the first trial of the Morgan abductors,\r\nhad, to the great delight of all Anti-Masons, flayed the defendants,\r\nbefore pronouncing sentence, in a remarkably effective and emphatic\r\naddress. Such a man was needed to strengthen the Jackson ticket, and\r\nbefore Van Buren got home it was charged that he had secured Throop's\r\npromise to stand for lieutenant-governor, with the assurance that\r\nwithin three months after his inauguration, if everything went\r\naccording to programme, he should be the acting governor.\r\n\r\nThese tactics meant the turning down of Nathaniel Pitcher, the acting\r\ngovernor in place of DeWitt Clinton. Pitcher had served four years in\r\nthe Assembly, one term in Congress, and as a delegate to the\r\nconvention in 1821. Though a man of limited education and strong\r\nprejudices, with a depth of feeling that made him as vigorously\r\nindependent as he was rigidly honest, he proved his fitness for the\r\nhigh office to which he had suddenly fallen heir by several excellent\r\nappointments to the Superior Court, just then created for the city of\r\nNew York. He honoured himself further by restoring the rule, so rudely\r\nbroken by Clinton, of offering the chancellorship to Chief Justice\r\nSavage, and, upon his declining it, to Reuben H. Walworth, then a\r\nyoung and most promising circuit judge. Later in the year, he named\r\nDaniel Mosely for the seventh circuit vacated by the resignation of\r\nEnos T. Throop, soon to become lieutenant-governor. These appointments\r\nmarked him as a wise and safe executive. Van Buren understood this,\r\nand his correspondence with Hamilton, and others, while absent in the\r\nwest, affords many interesting glimpses into his political methods in\r\ntheir immodest undress. As the candidate for governor, he was very\r\nactive just now. His letters indicate that he gave personal attention\r\nto the selection of all delegates, and that he wanted only those in\r\nwhom reliance could be absolutely placed. \"Your views about the\r\ndelegates are correct,\" he says to Hamilton. \"It would be hazarding\r\ntoo much to make out a list.\" A list might contain names of men who\r\ncould not be safely trusted at such a supreme moment; and Van Buren\r\nnaturally desired that his nomination should be enthusiastically\r\nunanimous. The slightest protest from some disappointed friend of\r\nNathaniel Pitcher, who was to be sacrificed for Throop, or of Joseph\r\nC. Yates, who was spending his years in forced retirement at\r\nSchenectady, would take away the glory and dull the effect of what was\r\nintended to be a sudden and unanimous uprising of the people's free\r\nand untrammelled delegates in favour of the senior United States\r\nsenator, the Moses of the newly-born Democratic party.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated trouble at the Herkimer convention, however, did not\r\nappear. Delegates were selected to nominate Martin Van Buren and Enos\r\nT. Throop, and, after they had carried out the programme with\r\nunanimity, Pitcher ceased to act with the Jackson party. But the\r\ncontest between the opposing parties proved exceedingly bitter and\r\nmalevolent. It resembled the scandalous campaign of John Adams and\r\nThomas Jefferson in 1800, and the more recent Blaine and Cleveland\r\ncanvass of 1884. Everything that could be tortured into apparent wrong\r\nwas served up to listening thousands. Van Buren had about him the\r\ngenius of Edwin Croswell, the unerring judgment of Benjamin F. Butler,\r\nthe wisdom of William L. Marcy, the diplomacy of Benjamin Knower, and\r\nthe scintillating brilliancy of Samuel A. Talcott; but like McGregor,\r\nVan Buren sat at the head of the table. He cautioned Noah, he\r\ncomplimented Coleman, he kept Southwick and Crary on the anti-masonic\r\nticket, he selected the candidate for lieutenant-governor, he called\r\nfor funds, and he insisted upon making the Adams administration\r\nodious. In referring to the President and his secretary of state, he\r\ndid not personally join in the cry of bargain and sale, of fraud and\r\ncorruption, of treachery and knavery; nor did he speak of them as \"the\r\nPuritan and the Blackleg;\" but for three years his criticisms had so\r\nassociated the Administration with Federalism and the offensive alien\r\nand sedition laws which Jefferson condemned and defeated in 1800, that\r\nthe younger Adams inherited the odium attached to his father a quarter\r\nof a century before.\r\n\r\nThe National Republicans retaliated with statements no less base and\r\nworthless, exhibiting Jackson as a military butcher and utterly\r\nilliterate, and publishing documents assailing his marriage, the\r\nchastity of his wife, and the execution of six militiamen convicted of\r\nmutiny. Thurlow Weed, who conducted the Adams campaign in the western\r\npart of the State, indulged in no personal attacks upon Jackson or his\r\nwife, refusing to send out the documents known as \"Domestic Relations\"\r\nand \"Coffin Handbills.\" \"The impression of the masses was that the six\r\nmilitiamen deserved hanging,\" he says, in his autobiography, \"and I\r\nlook back now with astonishment that enlightened and able statesmen\r\ncould believe that General Jackson would be injured with the people by\r\nruthlessly invading the sanctuary of his home, and permitting a lady\r\nwhose life had been blameless to be dragged forth into the arena of\r\npolitics.\"[257]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 309.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the election for governor and lieutenant-governor was\r\npractically settled by the nomination of an anti-masonic independent\r\nticket. Thurlow Weed advised Smith Thompson that votes enough to\r\ndefeat him would be thrown away upon Southwick. Van Buren wrote\r\nHamilton to \"bet for me on joint-account five hundred dollars that\r\nThompson will be defeated, and one hundred dollars on every thousand\r\nof a majority up to five thousand; or, if you can't do better, say\r\nfive hundred on the result and fifty on every thousand up to ten.\" The\r\nreturns justified his confidence. He received one hundred and\r\nthirty-six thousand votes to one hundred and six thousand for Thompson\r\nand thirty-three thousand for Southwick.[258] Francis Granger would\r\nprobably have received the aggregate vote of Thompson and Southwick,\r\nor three thousand more than Van Buren. That Weed rightly understood\r\nthe situation is evidenced by his insistence that a candidate be\r\nnominated acceptable to the Anti-Masons. \"Van Buren's election,\" said\r\nThurlow Weed, in his autobiography, the tears of disappointment and\r\nchagrin almost trickling down his cheeks when he wrote the words\r\nnearly half a century afterward, \"enabled his party to hold the State\r\nfor the twelve succeeding years.\"[259] But it was the last time, for\r\nmany years, that Thurlow Weed did not have his way in the party. It\r\nwas apparent that the opponents of Van Buren needed a leader who could\r\nlead; and, although it took years of patient effort to cement into a\r\nsolid fighting mass all the heterogeneous elements that Clinton left\r\nand Van Buren could not control, the day was destined to come when one\r\nparty flag floated over an organisation under the leadership of the\r\nstately form of Thurlow Weed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: _Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 307.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. SEWARD AND THURLOW WEED\r\n\r\n1830\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the election in 1828 brought hopeless defeat to the National\r\nRepublicans, apparently it imparted increased confidence and vigour to\r\nanti-Masonry. For a time, this movement resembled the growth of\r\nabolitionism at a later day, people holding that a secret society,\r\nwhich sought to paralyse courts, by closing the mouths of witnesses\r\nand otherwise unnerving the arm of justice, threatened the existence\r\nof popular government. The moral question, too, appealed strongly to\r\npersons prominent in social, professional, and church life, who\r\nincreased the excitement by renouncing masonic ties and signifying\r\ntheir conversion to the new gospel of anti-Masonry. Cadwallader D.\r\nColden, formerly the distinguished mayor of New York and a lawyer of\r\nhigh reputation, wrote an effective letter against Free Masonry, which\r\nwas supplemented by the famous document of David Barnard, a popular\r\nBaptist divine of Chautauqua County. Henry Dana Ward established the\r\n_Anti-Masonic Review_ in New York City, and Frederick Whittlesey\r\nbecame equally efficient and influential as editor of the Rochester\r\n_Republican_.\r\n\r\nBut the man who led the fight and became the centre from which all\r\ninfluences emanated was Thurlow Weed. Early in the struggle, as a\r\nmember of the Morgan committee, he investigated the crime of 1826.\r\nSoon after, he founded the _Anti-Masonic Enquirer_ of Rochester, whose\r\ncirculation, unparalleled in those days, quickly included the western\r\nand northern counties of New York, and the neighbouring States of\r\nOhio, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. Weed had been slow to yield to the\r\ninfluences which carried the question into politics, but, once having\r\ndetermined to appeal to the ballot-box, he set to work to strengthen\r\nand enlarge the party. It became a quasi-religious movement, ministers\r\nand churches, without any very far-reaching hopes and plans, labouring\r\nto bring about a spirit which should induce men to renounce Masonry;\r\nand in their zeal they worked with the singleness of thought and the\r\naccepted methods that dominate the revivalist and temperance advocate.\r\n\r\nThe aim of Thurlow Weed was to reach the people, and it mattered not\r\nhow often he had to bear defeat, or the sneers of older politicians\r\nand an established press; he flung himself into the work with an\r\nindomitable spirit and an entire disregard of trouble and pain. Weed\r\nwas a born fighter. He saw no visions, he believed in no omens, and he\r\nhad no thought of bearing a charmed life; but he seems to have been\r\nindifferent to changes of season or the assaults of men, as he\r\ntravelled from one end of the State to the other regardless of\r\ninclement weather, answering attacks with rough and rasping sarcasms,\r\nand meeting every crisis with the candour and courage of a John\r\nWesley. One reads in his autobiography, almost with a feeling of\r\nincredulity, of the toil cheerfully borne and the privations eagerly\r\nendured while the guiding member of the Morgan committee.\r\n\r\nWeed proved a great captain, not only in directing and inspiring\r\nanti-masonic movements, but in rallying to his standard a body of\r\nyoung men destined to occupy conspicuous places in the State and in\r\nthe nation. Among those entering the Assembly, in 1829, were Philo C.\r\nFuller of Livingston and Millard Fillmore of Erie. When Weed first met\r\nhim, in 1824, Fuller was a law clerk in James Wadsworth's office, only\r\ntwenty-three years old. But Weed noted his fitness for public place,\r\nand in 1828 had him nominated and elected to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nMillard Fillmore was a year or two older. His youth, like that of\r\nWeed, had been crowded with everything except schooling. He learned\r\nthe clothier's trade, he was apprenticed to a wool-carder, and he\r\nserved his time at the woodpile, in the harvest field, and as chore\r\nboy. Only at odd moments did he get an education; but when he began\r\nstudying law and teaching school he quickly evidenced a strength of\r\nintellect that distinguished him throughout life. Weed met him at an\r\nAdams convention in Buffalo, in 1828, and so favourably impressed was\r\nhe with his ability that he suggested his nomination for the Assembly.\r\n\r\nOne year later, Weed insisted upon the nomination of Albert H. Tracy,\r\nof Erie, for the Senate. Tracy, who had already served six years in\r\nCongress, had the advantage of being well born and well educated. His\r\nfather, a distinguished physician of Connecticut, urged him to adopt\r\nthe profession of medicine, but when about ready for a degree, he\r\nentered his brother's law office at Madison, New York, and, in 1815,\r\nupon his admission to the bar, settled in Buffalo. He was then\r\ntwenty-two years old. Four years later he entered Congress. He had\r\nearned this quick start by good ability; and so acceptably did he\r\nmaintain himself, that, in spite of the acrimony existing between\r\nClintonian and Bucktail, his name was regarded with much favour in\r\n1825 as the successor of Rufus King in the United States Senate. Tracy\r\nwas a man of marked ability. Though neither brilliant nor\r\ndistinguished as a public speaker, he was a skilful advocate, easy and\r\nnatural; with the help of a marvellous memory, and a calm, philosophic\r\ntemperament, he ranked among the foremost lawyers of his day. Like\r\nJames Tallmadge, he was inordinately ambitious for public life, and\r\nhis amiability admirably fitted him for it; but like Tallmadge, he was\r\nnot always governed by principle so much as policy. He showed at times\r\na lamentable unsteadiness in his leadership, listening too often to\r\nthe whispers of cunning opponents, and too easily separating himself\r\nfrom tried friends. In 1838, he practically left his party; and, soon\r\nafter, he ceased to practise his profession, burying a life which had\r\npromised great usefulness and a brilliant career. In mien, size,\r\nbearing, visage, and conversation he was the counterpart of Thomas\r\nJefferson when about the same age--a likeness of which Tracy was fully\r\nconscious.\r\n\r\nTracy's nomination to the Senate in 1829 came as a great surprise and\r\na greater gratification. He had not taken kindly to the anti-masonic\r\nparty. Only the year before, he dissuaded John Birdsall from accepting\r\nits nomination to Congress, because of the obloquy sure to follow\r\ndefeat; but its strength, evidenced in the campaign of 1828, opened\r\nhis eyes; and, while absent in Albany, unsuccessfully seeking a\r\njudgeship from Governor Throop, Thurlow Weed had him nominated. On his\r\nway home, he stopped at Rochester to call upon the great apostle of\r\nanti-Masonry, reaching the house before sunrise. \"He was wrapped in a\r\nlong camlet cloak,\" says Weed, \"and wore an air of depression that\r\nbetokened some great disappointment. 'You have been east?' I asked,\r\nfor I had not heard of his absence from home. 'Yes,' he answered.\r\n'Then you don't know what happened at Batavia yesterday?' He replied\r\nin the negative, and I continued: 'We had a convention and nominated a\r\ncandidate for senator.' When he laughingly inquired, 'Who?' I said,\r\n'Why, we nominated you.' He instantly jumped two feet from the floor\r\nand whooped like an Indian. Then, with brightened countenance and\r\nundisguised elation of spirit that he was to have a seat in the Senate\r\nfor four years, he informed me of his disappointment in not obtaining\r\neither the judgeship, or the presidency of the branch of the United\r\nStates Bank about to be established at Buffalo.\"[260]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 340.]\r\n\r\nThus far, Thurlow Weed had won more reputation than money in\r\nRochester. He dwelt in a cheap house in an obscure part of the\r\nvillage. Sometimes he had to borrow clothes to be presentable. \"One\r\nday,\" says Henry B. Stanton, \"I was standing in the street with him\r\nand Frederick Whittlesey when his little boy came up and said:\r\n'Father, mother wants a shilling to buy some bread.' Weed put on a\r\nqueer look, felt in his pockets, and remarked: 'That is a home appeal,\r\nbut I'll be hanged if I've got the shilling.' Whittlesey drew out a\r\nsilver dollar and gave the boy who ran off like a deer.\"[261] Yet, at\r\nthat moment, Weed with his bare arms spattered with printer's ink, was\r\nthe greatest power in the political life of Western New York.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 25.]\r\n\r\nBut a scheme more helpful to Weed and to his party than the election\r\nof young men of large promise was just now on foot. The need of a\r\nnewspaper at Albany, to represent the sentiments of the Anti-Masons\r\nhad long been recognised; and, to enable Weed to establish it, he had\r\nbeen re-elected to the Assembly in the autumn of 1829. In the course\r\nof the winter the project quickly took shape; a fund of twenty-five\r\nhundred dollars was subscribed; and on March 22, 1830, appeared the\r\nfirst number of the Albany _Evening Journal_, in which were soon to be\r\npublished the sparkling paragraphs that made it famous.[262] Weed's\r\nsalary as editor was fixed at seven hundred and fifty dollars. The\r\npaper was scarcely larger than the cloud \"like a man's hand;\" and its\r\none hundred and seventy subscribers, scattered from Buffalo to New\r\nYork, became somewhat disturbed by the acrimonious and personal\r\nwarfare instantly made upon it by Edwin Croswell of the _Argus_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: \"Writing slowly and with difficulty, Weed was for\r\ntwenty years the most sententious and pungent writer of editorial\r\nparagraphs on the American press.\"--Horace Greeley, _Recollections of\r\na Busy Life_, p. 312.]\r\n\r\nCroswell and Weed had been boys together at Catskill. They were\r\nneither intimates nor equals, although of the same age; for young\r\nCroswell had the advantage of position and education given him by his\r\nfather, then publisher of the _Recorder_. To Weed, only such work came\r\nas a bare-footed, ragged urchin of eleven was supposed to be capable\r\nof doing. This was in 1808. The two boys did not meet again for twenty\r\nyears, and then only to separate as Hamilton and Burr had parted, on\r\nthe road to White Plains, in the memorable retreat from Manhattan in\r\nSeptember, 1776. But Croswell, retaining the quiet, studious habits\r\nthat characterised his youth, climbed rapidly. He had become editor\r\nof the _Argus_, state printer, and one of the ablest and most zealous\r\nmembers of the Albany Regency. He possessed a judgment that seemed\r\nalmost inspired, with such untiring industry and rare ability that for\r\nyears the Democratic press of the country looked upon the _Argus_ as\r\nits guiding star.\r\n\r\nAgainst this giant in journalism Thurlow Weed was now to be opposed.\r\n\"You have a great responsibility resting upon your shoulders,\" wrote\r\nthe accomplished Frederick Whittlesey, \"but I know no man who is\r\nbetter able to meet it.\"[263] This was the judgment of a man who had\r\npersonal knowledge of the tremendous power of Weed's pen. In his later\r\nyears, Weed mellowed and forgave and forgot, but when he went to\r\nAlbany, and for years before, as well as after, he seemed to enjoy\r\nstriking an adversary. An explosion followed every blow. His sarcasms\r\nhad needle-points, and his wit, sometimes a little gross, smarted like\r\nthe sting of wasps. Often his attacks were so severe and merciless\r\nthat the distress of his opponents created sympathy for them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 361.]\r\n\r\nVery early in the _Evening Journal's_ history Croswell invited Weed's\r\nfire. It is doubtful if the _Argus'_ publisher thought or cared much\r\nabout the character of the reply. Editors are not usually sensitive to\r\nthe stricture of others. But when Weed's retort came, the rival\r\nwriters remained without personal or business relations until, years\r\nafterward, Croswell, financially crushed by the failure of the Albany\r\nCanal Bank, and suspected of dishonesty, implored Weed's assistance to\r\navoid a criminal indictment. In the meantime subscriptions poured into\r\nthe _Journal_. The people recognised a fighter; the thoughtful\r\ndistinguished a powerful mind; and politicians discovered such a\r\ngenius for leadership that Albany became a political centre for the\r\nNational Republicans as it was for the Bucktails. Within ten years\r\nafter its establishment, the _Evening Journal_ had the largest\r\ncirculation of any political paper in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe birth year of the _Journal_ also witnessed a reorganisation of\r\nthe Anti-Masons. Heretofore, this party had declared only its own\r\npeculiar principles, relying for success upon the aid of the National\r\nRepublicans; but, as it now sympathised with Henry Clay upon questions\r\nof governmental policy, especially the protection of American\r\nindustry, it became evident that, to secure the greatest political\r\nstrength, its future policy must be ardent antagonism to the\r\nprinciples of the Jackson party. Accordingly, at the Utica convention,\r\nheld in August, 1830, it adopted a platform substantially embracing\r\nthe views of the National Republicans. In acknowledgment of this\r\nchange, the Adams party accepted the nomination of Francis Granger for\r\ngovernor and Samuel Stevens, a prominent lawyer of Albany City and the\r\nson of a distinguished Revolutionary officer, for lieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\nThe Bucktails did not get on so smoothly at their convention, held at\r\nHerkimer, on September 8. Erastus Root thought if Van Buren could\r\nafford to take the nomination away from Acting Governor Pitcher, he\r\nmight deprive Enos T. Throop of the same honour. Throop, who was\r\nacting governor in the place of Van Buren, had proved a feeble\r\nexecutive. Besides, it could not be forgotten that Throop suffered Van\r\nBuren to humiliate Pitcher simply to make his own election sure. But\r\nThroop had friends if nothing else. On the first ballot, he received\r\nseventy-eight votes to forty for Root. The wrangle over\r\nlieutenant-governor proved less irritating, and Edward P. Livingston,\r\nafter several ballots, secured seventy-seven votes.\r\n\r\nThese contests created unusual bitterness. Root had the offer of\r\nsupport from a working men's convention; and his failure to secure the\r\nHerkimer nomination left the working men, especially in New York City,\r\nin no mood to support the Bucktail choice. All this greatly encouraged\r\nthe Anti-Masons. Granger and Stevens commanded the cordial support of\r\nthe National Republicans, while Throop and Livingston were personally\r\nunpopular. Throop had the manners of DeWitt Clinton without a tithe of\r\nhis ability, and Livingston, stripped of his family's intellectual\r\ntraits, exhibited only its aristocratic pride. But there were\r\nobstacles in the way of anti-masonic success. Among other things,\r\nFrancis Granger had become chairman of an anti-masonic convention at\r\nPhiladelphia, which Weed characterised as a mistake. \"The men from New\r\nYork who urged it are stark mad,\" he wrote; \"more than fifty thousand\r\nelectors are now balancing their votes, and half of them want an\r\nexcuse to vote against you.\"[264] Whether this \"mistake\" had the\r\nbaleful influence that Weed anticipated, could not, of course, be\r\ndetermined. The returns, however, proved a serious disappointment.[265]\r\nGranger had carried the eighth or \"infected district\" by the\r\nastounding majority of over seven thousand in each of the first five\r\ndistricts. In the sixth district the anti-masonic vote fell over four\r\nthousand. It was evident that the Eastern masons, who had until now\r\nacted with the National Republicans, preferred the rule of the Regency\r\nto government by Anti-Masons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: Throop, 128,842; Granger, 120,361.--_Civil List, State\r\nof New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nThe year that witnessed this disheartening defeat of the Anti-Masons,\r\nwelcomed into political life a young man of great promise, destined to\r\nplay, for the next forty years, a conspicuous part in the history of\r\nhis country. William Henry Seward was twenty-nine years old when\r\nelected to the State Senate; but to all appearances he might have been\r\neight years younger. He was small, slender, boyish, punctilious in\r\nattire, his blue eyes and finely moulded chin and mouth giving an\r\nunconscious charm to his native composure, which attracted with a\r\nmagnetism peculiarly its own; but there was nothing in his looks or\r\nmanner to indicate that the chronicle of the century would record his\r\nname among the country's most prominent statesmen. He had neither the\r\nbold, full forehead of Marcy, nor the tall, commanding form of\r\nTalcott, although the boyish face suggested the refinement of Butler's\r\nfeatures, softened by the blue eyes and light sandy hair. The only\r\nnoticeable feature was the nose, neither Roman nor Semitic, but long,\r\nprominent and aggressive, with nostrils slightly distended. In after\r\nyears, the brow grew heavier, the eyes more deeply set, and the chin,\r\nslightly drawn, gave greater prominence to the jaw and firmness to the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, Seward had not yet made his great legal contest in the\r\nFreeman case, setting up the then novel and unpopular defence of\r\ninsanity, and establishing himself as one of the ablest and grittiest\r\nlawyers in the State. But early in that year, he made a speech, at an\r\nanti-masonic conference, which won the confidence of the delegates\r\nsufficiently to admit him to leadership with Thurlow Weed, Francis\r\nGranger, John C. Spencer, Frederick Whittlesey, William H. Maynard,\r\nand Albert H. Tracy. He was the youngest man in the council, younger\r\nthan Whittlesey, four years younger than Weed, and eight years younger\r\nthan Tracy. Granger and John C. Spencer belonged almost to an earlier\r\ngeneration. Millard Fillmore was one year his senior; but Fillmore,\r\nwhose force and feeling made for conservatism, had not yet entered\r\nthat coterie of brilliant anti-masonic leaders.\r\n\r\nSeward was neither precocious nor gifted beyond his years. He had\r\nspirit and gifts, with sufficient temper and stubbornness to defend\r\nhim against impositions at home or in college; but the love for\r\nadventure and the strenuous life, that characterised Weed's capricious\r\nyouth, were entirely absent. As a boy, Weed, untidy even to\r\nslovenliness, explored the mountain and the valley, drifted among the\r\nresolute lads of the town, and lingered in gardens and orchards,\r\ninfinitely lovable and capable of the noblest tenderness. On the\r\ncontrary, Seward was precise, self-restrained, possessing the gravity\r\nand stillness of a youth who husbanded his resources as if conscious\r\nof physical frailty, yet wholesome and generous, and once, at least,\r\nsplendidly reckless in his race for independence of a father who\r\ndenied him the means of dressing in the fashion of other college\r\nstudents. By the time he reached the age of nineteen, he had run away\r\nto Georgia, taught school six months, studied law six months, and\r\ngraduated with honour from Union College. Two years later, in 1822,\r\nhe was admitted to the bar, and, having accepted a partnership with\r\nElijah Miller, located at Auburn. To make this arrangement the more\r\nbinding, he married his partner's daughter and became a member of his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nSeward retained the political affiliations of his father, who was a\r\nRepublican and a Bucktail, until the journey on the canal to Auburn\r\nopened his eyes to the importance of internal improvements. This so\r\ncompletely changed him into a Clintonian, that, in the autumn of 1824,\r\nhe assailed the Albany Regency with great vigour and voted for DeWitt\r\nClinton for governor. Four years later, he presided over a state\r\nconvention of young National Republicans, favourable to the\r\nre-election of John Quincy Adams; and then witnessed that party's\r\ndefeat and dispersion under the murderous fire of the Jackson forces,\r\naided by Southwick and Crary on the anti-masonic ticket. Seward had\r\nnot taken kindly to the anti-masonic party. What would have been his\r\nfinal attitude toward it is problematical had he not fallen under the\r\ninfluence of Weed. The first meeting of this illustrious pair, a very\r\ncasual meeting, occurred in the summer of 1824 while Seward was\r\npassing through Rochester on his return from a visit to Niagara Falls.\r\nA wheel of the coach came off, and among the curious who quickly\r\nassembled \"one taller and more effective, while more deferential and\r\nsympathising than the rest,\" says Seward, in his autobiography, \"lent\r\nhis assistance.\"[266] This was Thurlow Weed. \"My acquaintance with\r\nWilliam H. Seward grew rapidly on subsequent occasions,\" adds Weed,\r\n\"when he was called to Rochester on professional business. Our views\r\nin relation to public affairs, and our estimate of public men, rarely\r\ndiffered, and in regard to anti-Masonry he soon became imbued with my\r\nown opinions.\"[267]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: _Autobiography of William H. Seward_, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 137.]\r\n\r\nThis was the key that opened the way to great achievement. Tracy\r\nlistened to others and was lost; Fillmore finally preferred the\r\njudgment of his associates in Washington, and is to-day without a\r\nstatue even in his own home; but Seward kept closely in touch with the\r\nman whose political judgment inspired him with confidence. \"Come now\r\nand let us reason together,\" said Weed, and together these two friends\r\nworked out the policy of success. \"I saw in him, in a remarkable\r\ndegree,\" continued Weed, \"rapidly developing elements of character\r\nwhich could not fail to render him eminently useful in public life. I\r\ndiscerned also unmistakable evidences of stern integrity, earnest\r\npatriotism, and unswerving fidelity. I saw also in him a rare capacity\r\nfor intellectual labour, with an industry that never tired and\r\nrequired no relaxation; to all of which was added a purity and\r\ndelicacy of habit and character almost feminine.\"[268]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 423.]\r\n\r\nIn his _Autobiography_, Seward says he joined the anti-masonic party\r\nbecause he thought it the only active political organisation opposed\r\nto Jackson and Van Buren, whose policy seemed to him to involve \"not\r\nonly the loss of our national system of revenue, and of enterprises of\r\nstate and national improvement, but also the future disunion of the\r\nStates, and ultimately the universal prevalence of slavery.\"[269] Once\r\nan Anti-Mason, he became, like Weed, a zealous and aggressive member\r\nof the party. He embodied its creed in resolutions, he attended its\r\nfirst national convention at Philadelphia, he visited John Quincy\r\nAdams at Quincy--just then an anti-masonic candidate for Congress--he\r\naided in the establishment of the Albany _Evening Journal_, and, a\r\nlittle later, as a delegate to the party's second national convention\r\nat Baltimore, he saw Chief Justice Marshall upon the platform, sat\r\nbeside Thaddeus Stevens, and voted for William Wirt as an anti-masonic\r\ncandidate for President. It was during his attendance upon the\r\nPhiladelphia convention that Thurlow Weed had him nominated, without\r\nhis knowledge, for state senator. \"While stopping at Albany on my way\r\nsouth,\" he says,[270] \"Weed made some friendly but earnest inquiries\r\nconcerning my pecuniary ability, whether it was sufficient to enable\r\nme to give a portion of my time to public office. When I answered my\r\nability was sufficient, but I had neither expectation nor wish for\r\noffice, he replied that he had learned from my district enough to\r\ninduce him to think it possible that the party might desire my\r\nnomination to the Senate.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: _Autobiography of William H. Seward_, p. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: _Autobiography of William H. Seward_, p. 79.]\r\n\r\nThurlow Weed had many claims to the regard of his contemporaries, but\r\nthe greatest was the intelligence that enabled him to discern the\r\nrising genius of a recruit to anti-Masonry whose name was to help make\r\nillustrious any cause which he served.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nVAN BUREN'S ENEMIES MAKE HIM VICE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n1829-1832\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren's single message as governor exhibited a knowledge of\r\nconditions and needs that must rank it among the ablest state-papers\r\nin the archives of the capitol. Unlike some of his predecessors, with\r\ntheir sentences of stilted formality, he wrote easily and with vigour.\r\nHis message, however, was marred by the insincerity which shows the\r\npolitician. He approved canals, but, by cunningly advising \"the utmost\r\nprudence\" in taking up new enterprises, he coolly disparaged the\r\nChenango project; he shrewdly recommended the choice of presidential\r\nelectors by general ticket instead of by congressional districts,\r\nknowing that opposition to the change died with DeWitt Clinton. With\r\nfull knowledge of what he himself had done, in the last campaign, in\r\nurging upon John A. Hamilton the necessity of raising funds, he boldly\r\nattacked the use of money in elections, proposing \"the imposition of\r\nsevere penalties upon the advance of money by individuals for any\r\npurposes connected with elections except the single one of printing.\"\r\nIt is not surprising, perhaps, that a man of Van Buren's personal\r\nambition found himself often compelled, for the sake of his own\r\ncareer, to make his public devotion to principle radically different\r\nfrom his practice; but it is amazing that he should thus brazenly\r\nassume the character of a reformer before the ink used in writing\r\nHamilton was dry.\r\n\r\nThe prominent feature of Van Buren's message was the bank question,\r\nwhich, to do him credit, he discussed with courage, urging a general\r\nlaw for chartering banks without the payment of money bonus, and\r\ndeclaring that the only concern of the State should be to make banks\r\nand their circulation secure. In accord with this suggestion, he\r\nsubmitted the \"safety fund\" project, subsequently enacted into law,\r\nproviding that all banks should contribute to a fund, administered\r\nunder state supervision, to secure dishonoured banknotes. There was a\r\ngreat deal of force in Van Buren's reasoning, and the New York City\r\nbanks, which, at first, declined to recharter under the law, finally\r\naccepted the scheme with apparent cheerfulness. Had the real test,\r\nwhich came with the hard times of 1837, not broken it down, Van\r\nBuren's confidence in the project might have continued. After that\r\ncatastrophe, which was destined to prove his Waterloo, he had\r\nconfidence in nothing except gold and silver.\r\n\r\nAs anticipated, Van Buren's inauguration as governor preceded his\r\nappointment as secretary of state under President Jackson only seventy\r\ndays. It gave him barely time gracefully to assume the duties of one\r\nposition before taking up those of the other. But, in making the\r\nchange, he did not forget to keep an anchor to windward by having the\r\namiable and timid Charles E. Dudley succeed him in the United States\r\nSenate. Dudley had the weakness of many cultured, charming men, who\r\nare without personal ambition or executive force. He was incapable of\r\ntaking part in debate, or of exerting any perceptible influence upon\r\nlegislation in the committee-room. Nevertheless, he was sincere in his\r\nfriendships; and the opinion obtained that if Van Buren had desired\r\nfor any reason to return to the Senate, Dudley would have gracefully\r\nretired in his favour.\r\n\r\nThe appointments of Green C. Bronson as attorney-general, and Silas\r\nWright as comptroller of state, atoned for Dudley's election; for they\r\nbrought conspicuously to the front two men whose unusual ability\r\ngreatly honoured the State. Bronson had already won an enviable\r\nreputation at the bar of Oneida County. He was now forty years old, a\r\nstalwart in the Jackson party, bold and resolute, with a sturdy\r\nvigour of intellect that was to make him invaluable to the Regency. He\r\nhad been a Clintonian surrogate of his county and a Clintonian member\r\nof the Assembly in 1822, but he had changed since then, and his\r\npresent appointment was to give him twenty-two years of continuous\r\npublic life as a Democrat, lifting him from justice to chief justice\r\nof the Supreme Court, and transferring him finally to the Court of\r\nAppeals.\r\n\r\nSilas Wright was a younger man than Bronson, not yet thirty-five years\r\nold; but his admittance to the Regency completely filled the great gap\r\nleft by Marcy's retirement. Like Marcy, he was large and muscular,\r\nalthough with a face of more refinement; like Marcy, too, he dressed\r\nplainly. He had an affable manner stripped of all affectation. From\r\nhis first entrance into public life, he had shown a great capacity for\r\nthe administration of affairs. He looked like a great man. His\r\nunusually high, square forehead indicated strength of intellect, and\r\nhis lips, firmly set, but round and full, gave the impression of\r\nfirmness, with a generous and gentle disposition. There was no\r\nevidence of brilliancy or daring. Nor did he have a politician's face,\r\nsuch as Van Buren's. Even in the closing years of Van Buren's\r\nvenerable life, when people used often to see him, white-haired and\r\nbright-eyed, walking on Wall Street arm in arm with his son John, his\r\nwas still the face of a master diplomatist. Wright, on the other hand,\r\nlooked more like a strong, fearless business man. His manner of\r\nspeaking was not unlike Rufus King's. He spoke slowly, without\r\nrhetorical embellishment, or other arts of the orator; but, unlike\r\nKing, he had an unpleasant voice; nevertheless, if one may accept the\r\nopinion of a contemporary and an intimate, \"there was a subdued\r\nenthusiasm in his style of speaking that was irresistibly\r\ncaptivating.\" The slightly rasping voice was \"almost instantly\r\nforgotten in the beauty of his argument,\" which was \"clear, forcible,\r\nlogical and persuasive.\"[271]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: John S. Jenkins, _Lives of the Governors of New York_,\r\np. 790.]\r\n\r\nSilas Wright had already been in public life eight years, first as\r\nsurrogate of St. Lawrence County, afterward as state senator, and\r\nlater as a member of Congress. He had also increased his earnings at\r\nthe bar by holding the offices of justice of the peace, town clerk,\r\ninspector of schools, and postmaster at Canton. From the outset, he\r\nhad allied himself with the Regency party, and, with unfailing\r\nregularity he had supported all its measures, even those which his\r\nbetter judgment opposed. His ability and gentle manners, too,\r\napparently won the people; for, although St. Lawrence was a Clintonian\r\nstronghold, a majority of its voters believed in their young\r\noffice-holder--a fact that was the more noteworthy since he had broken\r\nfaith with them. In the campaign of 1823, he favoured the choice of\r\npresidential electors by the people; afterward, in the Senate, he\r\nvoted against the measure. So bitter was the resentment that followed\r\nthis bill's defeat, that many of the seventeen senators, who voted\r\nagainst it, ever afterward remained in private life. But Wright was\r\nforgiven, and, two years later, sent to Congress, where his public\r\ncareer really began. In a bill finally amended into the tariff act of\r\n1828, he sought to remove the complaint of manufacturers that the\r\ntariff of 1824 was partial to iron interests, and the criticism of\r\nagriculturalists, that the woollens bill, of 1827, favoured the\r\nmanufacturer. In this debate, he gave evidence of that genius for\r\nlegislation which was destined soon to shine in the United States\r\nSenate at a time when some of the fiercest political fights of the\r\ncentury were being waged.\r\n\r\nIt is evident Van Buren did not appreciate the capacity of Silas\r\nWright in 1831; otherwise, instead of William L. Marcy, Wright would\r\nhave succeeded Nathan Sanford in the United States Senate.[272] Marcy\r\nhad made an excellent state comptroller; his able and luminous\r\nreports had revealed the necessity of preserving the general fund, and\r\nthe danger of constructing additional lateral canals. As a judge of\r\nthe Supreme Court, also, his sound judgment had won him an enviable\r\nreputation, especially in the trial of the Morgan abductors, which was\r\nheld at a time of great excitement and intense feeling. But, as a\r\nUnited States senator, Marcy failed to realise the expectations of his\r\nfriends. Very likely two years were insufficient to test fairly his\r\nlegislative capacity. Besides, his services, however satisfactory,\r\nwould naturally be dwarfed in the presence of the statesmen then\r\nengaged in the great constitutional debate growing out of the Foote\r\nresolution, limiting the sale of public lands. Congress was rapidly\r\nmaking history; and the Senate, lifted into great prominence by the\r\nspeeches of Webster and Hayne, had become a more difficult place than\r\never for a new member. At all events, Marcy did not exhibit the\r\nparliamentary spirit that seeks to lead, or which delights in the\r\nstruggles of the arena where national reputations are made. He,\r\nmoreover, had abundant opportunity. Thomas H. Benton says that the\r\nsession of 1832 became the most prolific of party topics and party\r\ncontests in the annals of Congress; yet Marcy was dumb on those\r\nsubjects that were interesting every one else.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: \"Marcy was the immediate predecessor of Wright as state\r\ncomptroller and United States senator. Each possessed rare talents,\r\nbut they were totally dissimilar in mental traits and political\r\nmethods. Both were statesmen of scrupulous honesty, who despised\r\njobbery. Marcy was wily and loved intrigue. Wright was proverbially\r\nopen and frank. Marcy never trained himself to be a public speaker,\r\nand did not shine in the hand-to-hand conflicts of a body that was\r\nlustrous with forensic talents. A man's status in the United States\r\nSenate is determined by the calibre and skill of the opponents who are\r\nselected to cross weapons with him in the forum. Wright was\r\nunostentatious, studious, thoughtful, grave. Whenever he delivered an\r\nelaborate speech the Whigs set Clay, Webster, Ewing, or some other of\r\ntheir leaders to reply to him.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_,\r\np. 39.]\r\n\r\nEven when the great opportunity of Marcy's senatorial career was\r\nthrust upon him--the defence of Van Buren at the time of the latter's\r\nrejection as minister to Great Britain--he failed signally. The\r\ncontroversy growing out of Jackson's cabinet disagreements, ostensibly\r\nbecause of the treatment of Mrs. Eaton, wife of the Secretary of War,\r\nbut really because of Calhoun's hostility to Van Buren, due to the\r\nPresident's predilections for him as his successor, had made it\r\nevident to Van Buren that an entire reorganisation of the Cabinet\r\nshould take place. Accordingly, on April 11, 1831, he opened the way,\r\nby voluntarily and chivalrously resigning. President Jackson soon\r\nafter appointed him minister to England, and Van Buren sailed for his\r\npost. But when the question of his confirmation came up, in the\r\nfollowing December, Calhoun and his friends, joined by Webster and\r\nClay, formed a combination to defeat it. Calhoun's opposition was\r\nsimply the enmity of a political rival, but Webster sought to put his\r\nantagonism on a higher level, by calling Van Buren to account for\r\ninstructions addressed to the American Minister at London in regard to\r\nour commercial relations with the West Indian, Bahama, and South\r\nAmerican colonies of England.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Parliament permitted American vessels to trade with British\r\ncolonies, on condition that American ports be opened within a year to\r\nBritish vessels on the same terms as to American vessels. The Adams\r\nadministration, failing to comply with the statute within the year,\r\nset up a counter prohibition, which was in force when Van Buren,\r\nwishing to reopen negotiations, instructed McLane, the American\r\nMinister at London, to say to England that the United States had, as\r\nthe friends of the present administration contended at the time, been\r\nwrong in refusing the privileges granted by the act of 1825, but that\r\nour \"views have been submitted to the people of the United States, and\r\nthe counsels by which your conduct is now directed are the result of\r\nthe judgment expressed by the only earthly tribunal to which the late\r\nadministration was amenable for its acts.\" In other words, Van Buren\r\nhad introduced party contests in an official dispatch, not brazenly or\r\noffensively, perhaps, but with questionable taste, and, for this, the\r\ngreat senators combined and spoke against him--Webster, Clay, Hayne,\r\nEwing of Ohio, Holmes of Maine, and seven others--\"just a dozen and\r\nequal to a full jury,\" wrote Benton. Webster said he would pardon\r\nalmost anything when he saw true patriotism and sound American\r\nfeeling, but he could not forgive the sacrifice of these to party.\r\nClay characterised his language as that of an humble vassal to a proud\r\nand haughty lord, prostrating the American eagle before the British\r\nlion. In the course of his remarks, Clay also referred, in an\r\nincidental way, to the odious system of proscription practised in the\r\nState of New York, which, he alleged, Van Buren had introduced into\r\nthe general government.\r\n\r\nOnly four senators spoke in Van Buren's defence, recalling the weak\r\nprotest made in the Legislature on the day of DeWitt Clinton's removal\r\nas canal commissioner, but this gave William L. Marcy the greater\r\nopportunity for acquitting himself with glory and vindicating his\r\nfriend. It was not a strong argument he had to meet. Van Buren had\r\nbeen unfortunate in his language, although in admitting that the\r\nUnited States was wrong in refusing the privileges offered by the\r\nBritish law of 1825, he did nothing more than had Gallatin, whom Adams\r\nsent to England to remedy the same difficulty. Furthermore, by\r\nassuming a more conciliatory course Van Buren had been entirely\r\nsuccessful. To Webster's suggestion of lack of patriotism, and to\r\nClay's declaration that the American eagle had been prostrated before\r\nthe British lion, Marcy might have pointed to Van Buren's exalted\r\npatriotism during the War of 1812, citing the conscription act, which\r\nhe drafted, and which Benton declared the most drastic piece of war\r\nlegislation ever enacted into law. To Clay's further charge, that he\r\nbrought with him to Washington the odious system of proscription, the\r\nNew York senator could truthfully have retorted that the system of\r\nremovals, inaugurated by Jackson, was in full swing before Van Buren\r\nreached the national capital; that if he did not oppose it he\r\ncertainly never encouraged it; that of seventeen foreign\r\nrepresentatives, the Secretary of State had removed only four; and\r\nthat, in making appointments as governor, he never departed from the\r\nrule of refusing either to displace competent and trustworthy men, or\r\nto appoint the dishonest and incompetent. He could also have read\r\nLorenzo Hoyt's wail that Van Buren would \"not lend the least weight of\r\nhis influence to displace from office such men as John Duer,\" Adams'\r\nappointee as United States attorney at New York. But Marcy did nothing\r\nof the kind. He made no use of the abundant material at hand, out of\r\nwhich he might have constructed a brilliant speech if not a perfect\r\ndefence. Quite on the contrary he contented himself simply with\r\nreplying to Clay's slur. He defended the practice of political\r\nproscription by charging that both sides did it. Ambrose Spencer, he\r\nsaid, the man whom Clay was now ready to honour, had begun it, and he\r\nhimself \"saw nothing wrong in the rule that to the victors belong the\r\nspoils of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nIf the conspiracy of distinguished statesmen to defeat Van Buren's\r\nconfirmation was shallow and in bad taste, Marcy's defence was\r\nscarcely above the standard of a ward politician. Indeed, the\r\nattempted defence of his friend became the shame of both; since it\r\nforever fixed upon Marcy the odium of enunciating a vicious principle\r\nthat continued to corrupt American political life for more than half a\r\ncentury, and confirmed the belief that Van Buren was an inveterate\r\nspoilsman.[273]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: \"To this celebrated and execrable defence Van Buren\r\nowes much of the later and unjust belief that he was an inveterate\r\nspoilsman. Benton truly says that Van Buren's temper and judgment were\r\nboth against it.\"--Edward M. Shepard, _Life of Martin Van Buren_, p.\r\n233.]\r\n\r\nProbably an abler defence would in no wise have changed the result.\r\nFrom the first a majority of senators had opposed Van Buren's\r\nconfirmation, several of whom refrained from voting to afford Vice\r\nPresident Calhoun the exquisite satisfaction of giving the casting\r\nvote. \"It will kill him, sir, kill him dead,\" Calhoun boasted in\r\nBenton's hearing; \"he will never kick, sir, never kick.\" This was the\r\nthought of other opponents. But Thomas H. Benton believed otherwise.\r\n\"You have broken a minister and elected a Vice President,\" he said.\r\n\"The people will see nothing in it but a combination of rivals against\r\na competitor.\"\r\n\r\nThis also was the prophecy of Thurlow Weed. While the question of\r\nrejection was still under consideration, that astute editor declared\r\n\"it would change the complexion of his prospects from despair to hope.\r\nHis presses would set up a fearful howl of proscription. He would\r\nreturn home as a persecuted man, throw himself upon the sympathy of\r\nthe party, be nominated for Vice President, and huzzaed into office at\r\nthe heels of General Jackson.\"[274] On the evening Van Buren heard of\r\nhis rejection, in London, Lord Auckland, afterward governor-general of\r\nIndia, said to him: \"It is an advantage to a public man to be the\r\nsubject of an outrage.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n375.]\r\n\r\nIn New York, Van Buren's party took his rejection as the friends of\r\nDeWitt Clinton had taken his removal as canal commissioner.\r\nIndignation meetings were held and addresses voted. In stately words\r\nand high-sounding sentences, the Legislature addressed the President,\r\npromising to avenge the indignity offered to their most distinguished\r\nfellow citizen; to which Jackson replied with equal warmth and skill,\r\nassuming entire responsibility for the instructions given the American\r\nminister at London and for removals from office; and acquitting the\r\nSecretary of State of all participation in the occurrences between\r\nhimself and Calhoun. He had called Van Buren to the State Department,\r\nthe President said, to meet the general wish of the Republican party,\r\nand his signal success had not only justified his selection, but his\r\npublic services had in nowise diminished confidence in his integrity\r\nand great ability. This blare of trumpets set the State on fire; and\r\nvarious plans were proposed for wiping out the insult of the Senate.\r\nSome suggested Dudley's resignation and Van Buren's re-election, that\r\nhe might meet his slanderers face to face; others thought he should be\r\nmade governor; but the majority, guided by the wishes of the Cabinet,\r\nand the expression of friends in other States, insisted that his\r\nnomination as Vice President would strengthen the ticket and open the\r\nway to the Presidency in 1836.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the Democratic national convention met at Baltimore,\r\nin May, 1832, only one name was seriously considered for Vice\r\nPresident. Van Buren had opponents in P.P. Barbour of Virginia and\r\nRichard M. Johnson of Kentucky, but his friends had the convention. On\r\nthe first ballot, he received two hundred and sixty votes out of three\r\nhundred and twenty-six. Barbour had forty, Johnson twenty-six.\r\nDelegates understood that they must vote for Van Buren or quarrel with\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nVan Buren returned from London on July 5. New York was filled with a\r\nmultitude to welcome him back. At a great dinner, ardent devotion,\r\ntempered by decorum, showed the loyalty of old neighbours, in whose\r\nmidst he had lived, and over whom he had practically reigned for\r\nnearly a quarter of a century. Instead of killing him, the Senate's\r\nrejection had swung open a wider door for his entrance to the highest\r\noffice in the gift of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF THE WHIG PARTY\r\n\r\n1831-1834\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1832 seemed to be without an issue, save Van Buren's\r\nrejection as Minister to Great Britain, and Jackson's wholesale\r\nremovals from office. Yet it was a period of great unrest. The debate\r\nof Webster and Hayne had revealed two sharply defined views separating\r\nthe North and the South; and, although the compromise tariff act of\r\n1832, supported by all parties, and approved by the President, had\r\ntemporarily removed the question of Protection from the realm of\r\ndiscussion, the decided stand in favour of a State's power to annul an\r\nact of Congress had made a profound impression in the North. Under\r\nthese circumstances, it was deemed advisable to organise a Clay party,\r\nand, to this end, a state convention of National Republicans,\r\nassembled in Albany in June, 1831, selected delegates to a convention,\r\nheld in Baltimore in December, which unanimously nominated Henry Clay\r\nfor President. The Anti-Masons, who had previously nominated William\r\nWirt, of Maryland, and were in practical accord with the National\r\nRepublicans on all questions relating to federal authority, agreed to\r\njoin them, if necessary, to sustain these principles.\r\n\r\nA new issue, however, brought them together with great suddenness.\r\nThough the charter of the United States Bank did not expire until\r\n1836, the subject of its continuance had occupied public attention\r\never since President Jackson, in his first inaugural address, raised\r\nthe question of its constitutionality; and when Congress convened, in\r\nDecember, 1831, the bank applied for an extension of its charter.\r\nLouis McLane, then secretary of the treasury, advised the president\r\nof the bank that Jackson would approve its charter, if certain\r\nspecified modifications were accepted. These changes proved entirely\r\nsatisfactory to the bank; but Webster and Clay declared that the\r\nsubject had assumed aspects too decided in the public mind and in\r\nCongress, to render any compromise or change of front expedient or\r\ndesirable. Later in the session, the bill for the bank's recharter\r\npassed both branches of Congress. Then came the President's veto. The\r\nact and the veto amounted to an appeal to the people, and in an\r\ninstant the country was on fire.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, the anti-masonic state convention, confident\r\nof the support of all elements opposed to the re-election of Andrew\r\nJackson, met at Utica on June 21, 1832. Albert H. Tracy of Buffalo\r\nbecame its chairman. After he had warmed the delegates into\r\nenthusiastic applause by his happy and cogent reasons for the success\r\nof the party, Francis Granger was unanimously renominated for\r\ngovernor, with Samuel Stevens for lieutenant-governor. The convention\r\nalso announced an electoral ticket, equally divided between\r\nAnti-Masons and National Republicans, headed by James Kent[275] and\r\nJohn C. Spencer. In the following month, the National Republicans\r\nadopted the anti-masonic state and electoral tickets. It looked like a\r\nqueer combination, a \"Siamese twin party\" it was derisively called, in\r\nwhich somebody was to be cheated. But the embarrassment, if any\r\nexisted, seems to have been fairly overcome by Thurlow Weed, who\r\npatiently traversed the State harmonising conflicting opinions in the\r\ninterest of local nominations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: \"Chancellor Kent's bitter, narrow, and unintelligent\r\npolitics were in singular contrast with his extraordinary legal\r\nequipment and his professional and literary accomplishments.\"--Edward\r\nM. Shepard, _Life of Martin Van Buren_, p. 246.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Van Buren leaders proceeded with rare caution. There had\r\nbeen some alarming defections, notably the secession of the New York\r\n_Courier and Enquirer_, now edited by James Watson Webb, and the\r\nrefusal of Erastus Root longer to follow the Jackson standard. Samuel\r\nYoung had also been out of humour. Young declared for Clay in 1824,\r\nand had inclined to Adams in 1828. It was in his heart also to rally\r\nto the support of Clay in 1832. But, looking cautiously to the future,\r\nhe could not see his way to renounce old associates altogether; and\r\nso, as evidence of his return, he published an able paper in defence\r\nof the President's veto. There is no indication, however, that Erastus\r\nRoot was penitent. He had been playing a double game too long, and\r\nalthough his old associates treated him well, electing him speaker of\r\nthe Assembly in 1827, 1828, and again in 1830, he could not overlook\r\ntheir failure to make him governor. Finally, after accepting a\r\nnomination to Congress, his speeches indicated that he was done\r\nforever with the party of Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe Republican convention, which met at Herkimer, in September, 1832,\r\nnominated William L. Marcy for governor. Marcy had reluctantly left\r\nthe Supreme Court in 1831; and he did not now take kindly to giving up\r\nthe United States Senate, since the veto message had made success in\r\nthe State doubly doubtful. But no other candidate excited any\r\ninterest. Enos T. Throop had been practically ridiculed into\r\nretirement. He was nicknamed \"Small-light,\" and the longer he served\r\nthe smaller and the more unpopular he became. If we may accept the\r\njudgment of contemporaries, he lacked all the engaging qualities that\r\nusually characterise a public official, and possessed all the faults\r\nwhich exaggerate limited ability.\r\n\r\nMarcy had both tact and ability, but his opposition to the Chenango\r\ncanal weakened him in that section of the State. The Chenango project\r\nhad been a thorn in the Regency's side ever since Francis Granger, in\r\n1827, forced a bill for its construction through the Assembly,\r\nchanging Chenango from a reliable Jackson county to a Granger\r\nstronghold; but Van Buren now took up the matter, assuring the people\r\nthat the next Legislature should pass a law for the construction of\r\nthe canal, and to bind the contract Edward P. Livingston, with his\r\nfamily pride and lack of gifts, was unceremoniously set aside as\r\nlieutenant-governor for John Tracy of Chenango. This bargain, however,\r\ndid not relieve Marcy's distress. He still had little confidence in\r\nhis success. \"I have looked critically over the State,\" he wrote Jesse\r\nHoyt on the first day of October, \"and have come to the conclusion\r\nthat probably we shall be beaten. The United States Bank is in the\r\nfield, and I can not but fear the effect of fifty or one hundred\r\nthousand dollars expended in conducting the election in such a city as\r\nNew York.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a good enough excuse, perhaps, to give Hoyt. But Marcy's\r\ndespair was due more to the merciless ridicule of Thurlow Weed's pen\r\nthan to the bank's money. Marcy had thoughtlessly included, in one of\r\nhis bills for court expenses, an item of fifty cents paid for mending\r\nhis pantaloons; and the editor of the _Evening Journal_, in his\r\ninimitable way, made the \"Marcy pantaloons\" and the \"Marcy patch\" so\r\nridiculous that the slightest reference to it in any company raised\r\nimmoderate laughter at the expense of the candidate for governor. At\r\nRochester, the Anti-Masons suspended at the top of a long pole a huge\r\npair of black trousers, with a white patch on the seat, bearing the\r\nfigure 50 in red paint. Reference to the unfortunate item often came\r\nupon him suddenly. \"Now, ladies and gentlemen,\" shouted the driver of\r\na stage-coach on which Marcy had taken passage, \"hold on tight, for\r\nthis hole is as large as the one in the Governor's breeches.\" All this\r\nwas telling hard upon Marcy's spirits and the party's confidence.\r\nJesse Hoyt wrote him that something must be done to silence the absurd\r\ncry; but the candidate was without remedy. \"The law provided for the\r\npayment of the judge's expenses,\" he said, \"and while on this business\r\nsome work was done on pantaloons for which the tailor charged fifty\r\ncents. It was entered on the account, and went into the comptroller's\r\nhands without a particle of reflection as to how it would appear in\r\nprint.\" There was no suggestion of dishonesty. Weed was too skilful\r\nto raise a point that might be open to discussion, but he kept the\r\nwhole State in laughter at the candidate's expense. Marcy felt so\r\nkeenly the ridiculous position in which his patched pantaloons put him\r\nthat, although he usually relished jokes on himself, \"the patch\" was a\r\ndistressing subject long after he had been thrice elected governor.\r\n\r\nThe Granger forces had, however, something more influential to\r\novercome than a \"Marcy patch.\" Very early in the campaign it dawned\r\nupon the bankers of the State that, if the United States Bank went out\r\nof business, government deposits would come to them; and from that\r\nmoment every jobber, speculator and money borrower, as well as every\r\nbank officer and director, rejoiced in the veto. The prejudices of the\r\npeople, always easily excited against moneyed corporations, had\r\nalready turned against the \"monster monopoly,\" with its exclusive\r\nprivileges for \"endangering the liberties of the country,\" and now the\r\nbanks joined them in their crusade. In other words, the Jackson party\r\nwas sustained by banks and the opponents of banks, by men of means and\r\nmen without means, by the rich and the poor. It was a great\r\ncombination, and it resulted in the overwhelming triumph of Marcy and\r\nthe Jackson electoral ticket.[276]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: \"On one important question, Mr. Weed and I were\r\nantipodes. Believing that a currency in part of paper, kept at par\r\nwith specie, and current in every part of our country, was\r\nindispensable, I was a zealous advocate of a National Bank; which he\r\nas heartily detested, believing that its supporters would always be\r\nidentified in the popular mind with aristocracy, monopoly, exclusive\r\nprivileges, etc. He attempted, more than once, to overbear my\r\nconvictions on this point, or at least preclude their utterance, but\r\nwas at length brought apparently to comprehend that this was a point\r\non which we must agree to differ.\"--Horace Greeley, _Recollections of\r\na Busy Life_, p. 314.]\r\n\r\nThe western anti-masonic counties gave their usual majorities for\r\nFrancis Granger, but New York City and the districts bordering the\r\nHudson, with several interior counties, wiped them out and left the\r\nJackson candidate ten thousand ahead.[277]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: William L. Marcy, 166,410; Francis Granger, 156,672.\r\n_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nThis second defeat of Francis Granger had a depressing influence upon\r\nhis party. It had been a contest of giants. Webster's great speeches\r\nin support of the United States Bank were accepted as triumphant\r\nanswers to the arguments of the veto message, but nothing seemed\r\ncapable of breaking the solid Jackson majorities in the eastern and\r\nsouthern counties; and, upon the assembling of the Legislature, in\r\nJanuary, 1833, signs of disintegration were apparent among the\r\nAnti-Masons. Albert H. Tracy, despairing of success, began accepting\r\ninterviews with Martin Van Buren, who sought to break anti-Masonry by\r\nconciliating its leaders. It was the voice of the tempter. Tracy\r\nlistened and then became a missionary, inducing John Birdsall and\r\nother members of the Legislature to join him. Tracy had been an\r\nacknowledged leader. He was older, richer, and of larger experience\r\nthan most of his associates, and, in appealing to him, Van Buren\r\nexhibited the rare tact that characterised his political methods. But\r\nthe Senator from Buffalo could not do what Van Buren wanted him to do;\r\nhe could not win Seward or capture the _Evening Journal_. \"We had both\r\nbeen accustomed for years,\" says Thurlow Weed, \"to allow Tracy to do\r\nour political thinking, rarely differing from him in opinion, and\r\nnever doubting his fidelity. On this occasion, however, we could not\r\nsee things from his standpoint, and, greatly to his annoyance, we\r\ndetermined to adhere to our principles.\"[278]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 421. Seward, in his\r\n_Autobiography_, says of Tracy, p. 166: \"Albert H. Tracy is ... a man\r\nof original genius, of great and varied literary acquirements, of\r\nrefined tastes, and high and honourable principles. He seems the most\r\neloquent, I might almost say the only eloquent man in the Senate. He\r\nis plainly clothed and unostentatious. Winning in his address and\r\ngifted in conversation, you would fall naturally into the habit of\r\ntelling him all your weaknesses, and giving him unintentionally your\r\nwhole confidence. He is undoubtedly very ambitious; though he\r\nprotests, and doubtless half the time believes, that dyspepsia has\r\nhumbled all his ambition, and broken the vaultings of his spirit. I\r\ndoubt not that, dyspepsia taken into the account, he will be one of\r\nthe great men of the nation.\"]\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that many reasons existed well calculated to\r\ninfluence Tracy's action. William Wirt had carried only Vermont, and\r\nHenry Clay had received but forty-nine out of two hundred and\r\nsixty-five electoral votes. Anti-Masonry had plainly run its course.\r\nIt aroused a strong public sentiment against secret societies, until\r\nmost of the lodges in western New York had surrendered their charters;\r\nbut it signally failed to perpetuate its hold upon the masses. The\r\nsurrendered charters were soon reissued, and the institution itself\r\nbecame more popular and attractive than ever. These disheartening\r\nconditions were re-emphasised in the election of 1833. The county of\r\nWashington, before an anti-masonic stronghold, returned a Jackson\r\nassemblyman; and the sixth district, which had elected an anti-masonic\r\nsenator in 1829, now gave a Van Buren member over seven thousand\r\nmajority. But the most surprising change occurred in the eighth, or\r\n\"infected district.\" Three years before it had given Granger thirteen\r\nthousand majority; now it returned Tracy to the Senate by less than\r\ntwo hundred. For a long time his election was in doubt. Of the one\r\nhundred and twenty-eight assemblymen, one hundred and four belonged to\r\nthe Jackson party, and of the eight senators elected Tracy alone\r\nrepresented the opposition.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly not an encouraging outlook, and the leaders, after\r\nfull consultation, virtually declared the anti-masonic party\r\ndissolved. But this did not, however, mean an abandonment of the\r\nfield. It was impossible for men who believed in internal\r\nimprovements, in the protection of American industries, and in the\r\nUnited States Bank, to surrender to a party controlled by the Albany\r\nRegency, which was rapidly drifting into hostility to these great\r\nprinciples and into the acceptance of dangerous state rights'\r\ndoctrines. In giving up anti-Masonry, therefore, Weed, Seward,\r\nGranger, Whittlesey, Fillmore, John C. Spencer, and other leaders,\r\nsimply intended to let go one name and reorganise under another.\r\nSeveral Anti-Masons, following the lead of Tracy, fell by the way, but\r\npractically all the people who made up the anti-masonic and National\r\nRepublican forces continued to act together.\r\n\r\nSeveral events of the year aided the opposition party. The hostility\r\nof the Jackson leaders to internal improvements aroused former\r\nClintonians who believed in canals, and the widespread financial\r\nembarrassment alarmed commercial and mercantile interests. They\r\nresented the remark of the President that \"men who trade on borrowed\r\ncapital ought to fail,\" and the bold denial that \"any pressure existed\r\nwhich an honest man should regret.\" Business men, cramped for money,\r\nor already bankrupt because the United States Bank, stripped of its\r\ngovernment deposits, had curtailed its discounts, did not listen with\r\npatience or amiability to statements of such a character; nor were\r\nthey inclined to excuse the President's action on the theory that the\r\nUnited States Bank had cut down its loans to produce a panic, and thus\r\nforce a reversal of his policy. To them such utterances seemed to\r\nevince a want of sympathy, and opposition orators and journals took\r\nadvantage of the situation by eloquently denouncing a policy that\r\nembarrassed commerce and manufactures, throwing people out of\r\nemployment and bringing suffering and want to the masses.\r\n\r\nThe New York municipal election in the spring of 1834 plainly showed\r\nthat the voters resented the President's financial policy. For the\r\nfirst time in the history of the city, the people were to elect their\r\nmayor, and, although purely a local contest, it turned upon national\r\nissues. All the elements of opposition now used the one name of\r\n\"Whig.\" Until this time local organisations had adopted various\r\ntitles, such as \"Anti-Jackson,\" \"Anti-Mortgage,\" and \"Anti-Regency;\"\r\nbut the opponents of Jackson now claimed to be the true successors of\r\nthe Whigs of 1776, calling their movement a revolution against the\r\ntyranny and usurpation of \"King Andrew.\" They raised liberty poles,\r\nspoke of their opponents as Tories, and appropriated as emblems the\r\nnational flag and portraits of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe prospects of the new party brightened, too, when it nominated for\r\nmayor Gulian C. Verplanck, a member of Tammany Hall, a distinguished\r\ncongressman of eight years' service, and, until then, a representative\r\nof the Jackson party, highly esteemed and justly popular. Although\r\nbest known, perhaps, as a scholar and writer, Verplanck's active\r\nsympathies early led him into politics. He entered the Whig party and\r\nthe mayoralty campaign with high hopes of success. He led the\r\nmerchants and business men, while his opponent, Cornelius V.R.\r\nLawrence, also a popular member of Tammany, rallied the mechanics and\r\nlabouring classes. The spirited contest, characterised by rifled\r\nballot-boxes and broken heads, revealed at once its national\r\nimportance. If the new party could show a change in public sentiment\r\nin the foremost city in the Union, it would be helpful in reversing\r\nJackson's financial policy. So the great issue became a cry of \"panic\"\r\nand a threat of \"hard times.\" Like the strokes of a fire bell at\r\nnight, it alarmed the people, whose confidence began to waver and\r\nfinally to give way.\r\n\r\nThe evident purpose of the United States Bank was to create, if\r\npossible, the fear of a panic. By suddenly curtailing its loans,\r\nostensibly because of the removal of the deposits, it brought such\r\npressure upon the state banks that a suspension of specie payment\r\nseemed inevitable. To relieve this situation, Governor Marcy and the\r\nLegislature, acting with great promptness, pledged the State's credit\r\nto the banks, should the exigency require such aid, to the amount of\r\nsix million dollars. This was called \"Marcy's mortgage.\" The Whigs\r\nstigmatised it as a pledge of the people's property for the benefit of\r\nmoney corporations, denouncing the project as little better than a\r\nvulgar swindle in the interest of the Democratic party. Whether\r\nMarcy's scheme really averted the threatened calamity, or whether the\r\nUnited States Bank had already carried its contraction as far as it\r\nintended, it is certain that the fear of a panic served its purpose in\r\nthe campaign. The Whigs became enthusiastic, and, as the United States\r\nBank now began relieving the commercial embarrassment by extending its\r\nloans and giving its friends in New York special advantages, the party\r\nfelt certain of victory. When the polls closed the result did not\r\nfully realise Whig anticipations; yet it disclosed a Democratic\r\nmajority, cut down from five thousand to two hundred, with a loss of\r\nthe Council. Verplanck had, indeed, been beaten by one hundred and\r\neighty-one votes; but the Common Council, carrying with it the\r\npatronage of the city, amounting to more than one million dollars a\r\nyear, had been easily won. The Democrats had the shadow, it was said,\r\nand the Whigs the substance.\r\n\r\nThis election, and other successes in many towns throughout the State,\r\ngreatly encouraged the leaders of the opposition. A convention held at\r\nSyracuse, in August, 1834, adopted the title of \"Whig,\" and the new\r\nparty exulted in its name. To add to the enthusiasm, Daniel Webster\r\ndeclared, in a letter, that, from his cradle, he had \"been educated in\r\nthe principles of the Whigs of '76.\" The New York City election was\r\nreferred to as the \"Lexington\" of the revolution against \"King\r\nAndrew,\" as its prototype was against King George.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs' hope of success was heightened, also, by the unanimous\r\nnomination of William H. Seward for governor. Seward was now\r\nthirty-three years of age. During his four years in the Senate,\r\npolitical expediency neither limited nor controlled his opinions. He\r\nhad argued for reform in the military system; he had favoured the\r\nabolition of imprisonment for debt; he had vigorously opposed the\r\nattacks upon the United States Bank and the removal of the deposits;\r\nhe had antagonised the Chenango canal for reasons presented by\r\nComptroller Marcy, and he gave generously of his time in the Court of\r\nErrors. He had grown into a statesman of acknowledged genius and\r\npopularity, placing himself in sympathy with the masses, denouncing\r\nmisrule and supporting measures of reform. Of all the old and\r\nexperienced members of the Senate, it was freely admitted that none\r\nsurpassed him in a knowledge of the affairs of the State, or in a\r\nreadiness to debate leading questions. But, well fitted as he was, he\r\ndid not solicit the privilege of being a candidate for governor. On\r\nthe contrary, with Weed and Whittlesey, he tried to find some one\r\nelse. Granger preferred going to Congress; Verplanck had not yet\r\nrecovered from the chagrin and disappointment of losing the mayoralty;\r\nMaynard was dead, and James Wadsworth would not accept office. To\r\nSeward an acceptance of the nomination, therefore, appealed almost as\r\na matter of duty.\r\n\r\nSilas M. Stilwell of New York became the candidate for\r\nlieutenant-governor. Stilwell had been a shoemaker, and, until the\r\norganisation of the Whig party, a stalwart supporter of the Regency,\r\noccupying a conspicuous place as an industrious and ambitious member\r\nof the Assembly. When the deposits were removed and a panic threatened\r\nhe declared himself a Whig.\r\n\r\nConfidence characterised the convention which nominated Seward and\r\nStilwell. Young men predominated, and their enthusiasm was aroused to\r\nthe highest pitch by the eloquence of Peter R. Livingston, their\r\nvenerable chairman. Like a new convert, Livingston prophesied victory.\r\nLivingston had been a wheel-horse in the party of Jefferson. He had\r\nserved in the Senate with Van Buren; he had taken a leading part in\r\nthe convention of 1821, and he had held, with distinction, the\r\nspeakership of the Assembly and the presidency of the Senate. His\r\ncreed was love of republicanism and hatred of Clinton. At one time he\r\nwas the faithful follower, the enthusiastic admirer, almost the\r\ndevotee of Van Buren; and, so long as the Kinderhook statesman opposed\r\nClinton, he needed Livingston. But, when the time came that Van Buren\r\nmust conciliate Clinton, Livingston was dropped from the Senate. The\r\nconsequences were far more serious than Van Buren intended. Livingston\r\nwas as able as he was eloquent, and Van Buren's coalition with\r\nClinton quickly turned Livingston's ability and eloquence to the\r\nsupport of Clay. Then he openly joined the Whigs; and to catch his\r\ninfluence, and the thrill of his remarkable voice, they made him\r\nchairman of their first state convention. As an evidence of their\r\nenthusiasm, the whole body of delegates, with music and flags, drove\r\nfrom Syracuse to Auburn, twenty-six miles, to visit their young\r\ncandidate for governor.\r\n\r\nIn the same month the Democrats renominated Marcy and John Tracy,\r\nstrong in prestige of past success and present power. Instantly, the\r\ntwo leading candidates were contrasted--Marcy, the mature and\r\nexperienced statesman; Seward, a \"red-haired young man,\" without a\r\nrecord and unknown to fame. Stilwell was told to \"stick to his boots\r\nand shoes;\" and, in resentment, tailors, printers, shoemakers, and men\r\nof other handicraft, organised in support of \"the working man\" against\r\nthe \"Jackson Aristocrats.\" In answer to the _Commercial Advertiser's_\r\nsneer that Seward was \"red-haired,\" William L. Stone, with felicitous\r\nhumour, told how Esau, and Cato, Clovis, William Rufus, and Rob Roy\r\nnot only had red hair, but each was celebrated for having it; how\r\nOssian sung a \"lofty race of red-haired heroes,\" how Venus herself was\r\ngolden-haired, as well as Patroclus and Achilles. \"Thus does it\r\nappear,\" the article concluded, \"that in all ages and in all\r\ncountries, from Paradise to Dragon River, has red or golden hair been\r\nheld in highest estimation. But for his red hair, the country of Esau\r\nwould not have been called Edom. But for his hair, which was doubtless\r\nred, Samson would not have carried away the gates of Gaza. But for his\r\nred hair, Jason would not have navigated the Euxine and discovered the\r\nGolden Horn. But for the red hair of his mistress, Leander would not\r\nhave swum the Hellespont. But for his red hair, Narcissus would not\r\nhave fallen in love with himself, and thereby become immortal in song.\r\nBut for his red hair we should find nothing in Van Buren to praise.\r\nBut for red hair, we should not have written this article. And, but\r\nfor his red hair, William H. Seward might not have become governor of\r\nthe State of New York! Stand aside, then, ye Tories, and 'Let go of\r\nhis hair.'\"[279]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 238.]\r\n\r\nThe mottoes of this campaign illustrate the principles involved in it.\r\n\"Seward and Free Soil, or Marcy with his Mortgage\" was a favourite\r\nwith the Whigs. \"The Monster Bank Party\" became the popular cry of\r\nDemocrats, to which the Whigs retorted with \"The Party of Little\r\nMonsters.\" \"Marcy's Pantaloons,\" \"No Nullification,\" and \"Union and\r\nLiberty\" also did service. Copper medals bearing the heads of\r\ncandidates were freely distributed, and humourous campaign songs, set\r\nto popular music, began to be heard.\r\n\r\nIt was a lively campaign, and reports of elections in other States,\r\nshowing gratifying gains, kept up the hopes of Whigs. But, at the end,\r\nthe withering majorities in Democratic strongholds remained unbroken,\r\nre-electing Marcy and Tracy by thirteen thousand majority,[280] and\r\ncarrying every senatorial district save the eighth, and ninety-one of\r\nthe one hundred and twenty-two assemblymen. The Whigs had put forward\r\ntheir ablest men for the Legislature and for Congress, but, outside of\r\nthose chosen in the infected district, few appeared in the halls of\r\nlegislation, either at Albany or at Washington. Francis Granger went\r\nto Congress. \"He has had a fortunate escape from his dilemma, and I\r\nrejoice at it,\" wrote Seward to Thurlow Weed. \"He is a noble fellow,\r\nand I am glad that, if we could not make him what we wished, we have\r\nbeen able to put him into a career of honour and usefulness.\"[281]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: William L. Marcy, 181,905; William H. Seward,\r\n168,969.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: _Autobiography of William H. Seward_, p. 241.]\r\n\r\nSeward was not broken-hearted over his defeat. The majority against\r\nhim was not so large as Granger encountered in 1832; but it was\r\nsufficiently pronounced to send him back to his profession with the\r\nfeeling that his principles and opinions were not yet wanted. \"If I\r\nlive,\" he said to Weed, \"and my principles ever do find favour with\r\nthe people, I shall not be without their respect. Believe me, there\r\nis no affectation in my saying that I would not now exchange the\r\nfeelings and associations of the vanquished William H. Seward for the\r\nvictory and 'spoils' of William L. Marcy.\"[282]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: _Autobiography of William H.

His eye was now intently fixed upon the White House, and the\r\nlong, rapid strides, encouraged by Jackson, carried him swiftly toward\r\nthe goal of his ambition. He was surrounded by powerful friends.\r\nEdward Livingston, the able and accomplished brother of the\r\nChancellor, still held the office of secretary of state; Benjamin F.\r\nButler, his personal friend and former law partner, was\r\nattorney-general; Silas Wright, the successor of Marcy, and Nathaniel\r\nP. Tallmadge, the eloquent successor of the amiable Dudley, were in\r\nthe United States Senate. Among the members of the House, Samuel\r\nBeardsley and Churchill C. Cambreling, firm and irrepressible, led the\r\nAdministration's forces with conspicuous ability. At Albany, Marcy was\r\ngovernor, Charles L. Livingston was speaker of the Assembly, Azariah\r\nC. Flagg state comptroller, John A. Dix secretary of state, Abraham\r\nKeyser state treasurer, Edwin Croswell state printer and editor of\r\nthe _Argus_, and Thomas W. Olcott the able financier of the Regency.\r\nAll were displaying a devotion to the President, guided by infinite\r\ntact, that distinguished them as the organisers and disciplinarians of\r\nthe party. \"I do not believe,\" wrote Thurlow Weed, \"that a stronger\r\npolitical organisation ever existed at any state capital, or even at\r\nthe national capital. They were men of great ability, great industry,\r\nindomitable courage, and strict personal integrity.\"[283]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 103.]\r\n\r\nJohn A. Dix seemed destined from the first to leave an abiding mark in\r\nhistory. Very early in life he was distinguished for executive\r\nability. Although but a boy, he saw active service throughout the War\r\nof 1812, having been appointed a cadet at fourteen, an ensign at\r\nfifteen, and a second lieutenant at sixteen. After the war, he served\r\nas aide-de-camp on the staff of General Brown, living at Fortress\r\nMonroe and at Washington, until feeble health led to his resignation\r\nin 1828. Then he began the practice of law at Cooperstown. In 1830,\r\nwhen Governor Throop made him adjutant-general, he removed to Albany.\r\nHe was now twenty-six years old, an accomplished writer, a vigorous\r\nspeaker, and as prompt and bold in his decisions as in 1861, when he\r\nstruck the high, clear-ringing note for the Union in his order to\r\nshoot the first man who attempted to haul down the American flag. He\r\nwas not afraid of any enterprise; he was not abashed by the stoutest\r\nopposition; he was not even depressed by failure. When the call came,\r\nhe leaped up to sudden political action, and very soon was installed\r\nas a member of the Regency.\r\n\r\nDix had one great advantage over most of his contemporaries in\r\npolitical life--he was able to write editorials for the _Argus_. It\r\ntook a keen pen to find an open way to its columns. Croswell needed\r\nassistance in these days of financial quakings and threatened party\r\ndivisions, but he would accept it only from a master. Until this time,\r\nWright and Marcy had aided him. Their love for variety of subject,\r\ncharacteristic, perhaps, of the gifted writer, presented widely\r\ndiffering themes, flavoured with humour and satire, making the paper\r\nattractive if not spectacular. To this work Dix, who had already\r\npublished a _Sketch of the Resources of the City of New York_, now\r\nbrought the freshness of a strong personality and the training of a\r\nscholar and linguist. He had come into public life under the influence\r\nof Calhoun, for whom the army expressed a decided preference in 1828;\r\nbut he never accepted the South Carolinian's theory of nullification.\r\nDix had inherited loyalty from his father, an officer in the United\r\nStates army, and he was quick to strike for his country when South\r\nCarolina raised the standard of rebellion in 1861.\r\n\r\nThere was something particularly attractive about John A. Dix in these\r\nearlier years. He had endured hardships and encountered dangers, but\r\nhe had never known poverty; and after his marriage he no longer\r\ndepended upon the law or upon office for life's necessities. Educated\r\nat Phillips Exeter Academy, at the College of Montreal, and at St.\r\nMary's College in Baltimore, he learned to be vigorous without\r\negotism, positive without arrogance, and a man of literary tastes\r\nwithout affectation. Even long years of earnest controversy and\r\nintense feeling never changed the serene purity of his life, his lofty\r\npurposes, or the nobility of his nature. It is doubtful if he would\r\nhave found distinction in the career of a man of letters, to which he\r\nwas inclined. He had the learning and the scholarly ambition. Like\r\nBenjamin F. Butler, he could not be content with a small measure of\r\nknowledge. He studied languages closely, he read much of the world's\r\nliterature in the original, and he could write on political topics\r\nwith the firm grasp and profound knowledge of a statesman of broad\r\nviews; but he could not, or did not, turn his English into the realm\r\nof literature. Yet his _Winter in Madeira and a Summer in Spain and\r\nFlorence_, published in 1850, ran through five editions in three\r\nyears, and is not without interest to-day, after so many others, with,\r\ndefter pen, perhaps, have written of these sunny lands. His\r\nappointment as secretary of state in 1833 made him also state\r\nsuperintendent of common schools, and his valuable reports, published\r\nduring the seven years he filled the office, attest his intelligent\r\ndevotion to the educational interests of New York, not less than his\r\neditorial work on the _Argus_ showed his loyal attachment to Van\r\nBuren.\r\n\r\nBut, despite the backing of President Jackson, and the influence of\r\nother powerful friends, there was no crying demand outside of New York\r\nfor Van Buren's election to the Presidency. He had done nothing to\r\nstir the hearts of his countrymen with pride, or to create a\r\npronounced, determined public sentiment in his behalf. On the\r\ncontrary, his weaknesses were as well understood without New York as\r\nwithin it. David Crockett, in his life of Van Buren, speaks of him as\r\n\"secret, sly, selfish, cold, calculating, distrustful, treacherous,\"\r\nand \"as opposite to Jackson as dung is to a diamond.\" Crockett's book,\r\nwritten for campaign effect, was as scurrilous as it was interesting,\r\nbut it proved that the country fully understood the character of Van\r\nBuren, and that, unlike Jackson, he had no great, redeeming,\r\niron-willed quality that fascinates the multitude. Tennessee, the home\r\nState of Jackson, opposed him with bitterness; Virginia declared that\r\nit favoured principles, not men, and that in supporting Van Buren it\r\nhad gone as far astray as it would go; Calhoun spoke of the Van Buren\r\nparty as \"a powerful faction, held together by the hopes of plunder,\r\nand marching under a banner whereon is written 'to the victors belong\r\nthe spoils.'\" Everywhere there seemed to be unkindness, unrest, or\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Van Buren's candidacy had been so persistently and\r\nsystematically worked up by the President that, from the moment of his\r\ninauguration as Vice President, his succession to the Presidency was\r\naccepted as inevitable. It is doubtful if a man ever slipped into an\r\noffice more easily than Martin Van Buren secured the Presidency. That\r\nthere might be no failure at the last moment, a national democratic\r\nconvention, the second one in the history of the party, was called to\r\nnominate him at Baltimore, in May, 1835, eighteen months before the\r\nelection. When the time came, South Carolina, Alabama, and Illinois\r\nwere unrepresented; Tennessee had one delegate, and Mississippi and\r\nMissouri only two each; but Van Buren's nomination followed with an\r\nease and a unanimity that caused a smile even among the office-holding\r\ndelegates.\r\n\r\nIndeed, slavery was the only thing in sight to disturb Van Buren. At\r\npresent, it was not larger than a cloud \"like a man's hand,\" but the\r\nagitation had begun seriously to disturb politicians. After the North\r\nhad emerged from the Missouri struggle, chafed and mortified by the\r\ntreachery of its own representatives, the rapidly expanding culture of\r\ncotton, which found its way in plenty to northern seaports, had\r\napparently silenced all opposition. A few people, however, had been\r\ngreatly disturbed by the arguments of a small number of reformers,\r\nmuch in advance of their time, who were making a crusade against the\r\nwhole system of domestic slavery. Some of these men won honoured names\r\nin our history. One of them was Benjamin Lundy. In 1815, when\r\ntwenty-six years old, Lundy organised an anti-slavery association,\r\nknown as the \"Union Humane Society,\" and, in its support, he had\r\ntraversed the country from Maine to Tennessee, lecturing, editing\r\npapers, and forming auxiliary societies. He was a small, deaf,\r\nunassuming Quaker, without wealth, eloquence, or marked ability; but\r\nhe had courage, tremendous energy, and a gentle spirit. He had lived\r\nfor a time in Wheeling, Virginia, where the horrors, inseparable from\r\nslavery, impressed him very much as the system in the British West\r\nIndies had impressed Zachary Macaulay, father of the distinguished\r\nessayist and historian; and, like Macaulay, he ever after devoted his\r\ntime and his abilities to the generous task of rousing his countrymen\r\nto a full sense of the cruelties practised upon slaves.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, he happened to meet William Lloyd Garrison. Garrison's\r\nattention had not previously been drawn to the slavery question, but,\r\nwhen he heard Lundy's arguments, he joined him in Baltimore,\r\ndemanding, in the first issue of _The Genius_, immediate emancipation\r\nas the right of the slave and the duty of the master. William Lloyd\r\nGarrison was young then, not yet twenty-three years of age, but he\r\nstruck hard, and soon found himself in jail, in default of the payment\r\nof fifty dollars fine and costs for malicious libel. At the end of\r\nforty-nine days, Arthur Tappan, of New York City, paid the fine, and\r\nGarrison, returning to Boston, issued the first number of _The\r\nLiberator_ on January 1, 1830.\r\n\r\nThis opened the agitation in earnest. Garrison treated slavery as a\r\ncrime, repudiating all creeds, churches, and parties which taught or\r\naccepted the doctrine that an innocent human being, however black or\r\ndown-trodden, was not the equal of every other and entitled to the\r\nsame inalienable rights. The South soon heard of him, and the Georgia\r\nLegislature passed an act offering a reward of five thousand dollars\r\nfor his delivery into that State. Indictments of northern men by\r\nsouthern grand juries now became of frequent occurrence, one governor\r\nmaking requisition upon Governor Marcy for the surrender of Arthur\r\nTappan, although Tappan had never been in a Southern State. The South,\r\nfinding that long-distance threats, indictments, and offers of reward\r\naccomplished nothing, waked into action its northern sympathisers, who\r\nappealed with confidence to riot and mob violence. In New York City,\r\nthe crusade opened in October, 1833, a mob preventing the organisation\r\nof an anti-slavery society at Clinton Hall. Subsequently, on July 4,\r\n1834, an anti-slavery celebration in Chatham Street chapel was broken\r\nup, and five days later, the residence of Lewis Tappan was forced open\r\nand the furniture destroyed. These outrages were followed by the\r\ndestruction of churches, the dismantling of schoolhouses, and the\r\nlooting of dwellings, owned or used by coloured people. In October,\r\n1835, a committee of respectable citizens of Utica, headed by Samuel\r\nBeardsley, then a congressman and later chief justice of the State,\r\nbroke up a meeting called to organise a state anti-slavery society,\r\nand destroyed the printing press of a democratic journal which had\r\nspoken kindly of Abolitionists. The agitators, however, were in no\r\nwise dismayed or disheartened. It would have taken a good deal of\r\npersecution to frighten Beriah Green, or to confuse the conscience of\r\nArthur Tappan.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such scenes came tidings that slavery had been\r\nabolished in the British West Indies, and that the Utica indignity had\r\nbeen signalised by the conversion of Gerrit Smith. Theretofore, Smith\r\nhad been a leading colonisationist--thereafter he was to devote\r\nhimself to the principles of abolitionism. Gerrit Smith, from his\r\nearliest years, had given evidence of precocious and extraordinary\r\nintelligence. Thurlow Weed pronounced him \"the handsomest, the most\r\nattractive, and the most intellectual young man I ever met.\" Smith was\r\nthen seventeen years old--a student in Hamilton College. \"He dressed\r\n_à la_ Byron,\" continues Weed, \"and in taste and manners was\r\ninstinctively perfect.\"[284] His father was Peter Smith, famous in his\r\nday as one of the largest landowners in the United States; and,\r\nalthough this enormous estate was left the son in his young manhood,\r\nit neither changed his simple, gentle manners, nor the purpose of his\r\nnoble life.[285] By profession, Gerrit Smith was a philanthropist, and\r\nin his young enthusiasm he joined the American Colonisation Society,\r\norganised in 1817, for the purpose of settling the western coast of\r\nAfrica with emancipated blacks. It was a pre-eminently respectable\r\nassociation. Henry Clay was its president, and prominent men North and\r\nSouth, in church and in state, approved its purpose and its methods.\r\nIn 1820 it purchased Sherbro Island; but finding the location\r\nunfortunate, other lands were secured in the following year at Cape\r\nMesurado, and about a thousand emigrants sent thither during the next\r\nseven years. Gerrit Smith, however, found the movement too slow, if\r\nnot practically stranded, by the work of the cotton-gin and the\r\ndoctrine of Calhoun, that \"the negro is better off in slavery at the\r\nSouth than in freedom elsewhere.\" So, in 1830, he left the society to\r\nthose whose consciences condemned slavery, but whose conservatism\r\nrestrained them from offensive activity. The society drifted along\r\nuntil 1847, when the colony, then numbering six or seven thousand,\r\ndeclared itself an independent republic under the name of Liberia. In\r\nthe meantime, Smith, unaided and alone, had provided homes in northern\r\nStates, on farms of fifty acres each, for twice as many emancipated\r\nblacks, his gifts aggregating over two hundred thousand acres.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: \"Many years ago I was riding with Gerrit Smith in\r\nnorthern New York. He suddenly stopped the carriage, and, looking\r\naround for a few minutes, said: 'We are now on some of my poor land,\r\nfamiliarly known as the John Brown tract;' and he then added, 'I own\r\neight hundred thousand acres, of which this is a part, and all in one\r\npiece.' Everybody knows that his father purchased the most of it at\r\nsales by the comptrollers of state for unpaid taxes. He said he owned\r\nland in fifty-six of the sixty counties in New York. He was also a\r\nlandlord in other States.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p.\r\n189.]\r\n\r\nGerrit Smith's conversion to abolitionism helped the anti-slavery\r\ncause, much as the conversion of St. Paul benefited the Christian\r\nchurch. He brought youth, courage, enthusiasm, wealth, and marked\r\nability. Although alienated from him for years because of his peculiar\r\ncreed, Thurlow Weed refers in loving remembrance to \"his great\r\nintellect, genial nature, and ample fortune, which were devoted to all\r\ngood works.\" When the people of Utica, his native town, broke up the\r\nmeeting called to form a state anti-slavery society, Smith promptly\r\ninvited its projectors to his home at Peterborough, Madison County,\r\nwhere the organisation was completed. He was thirty-three years old\r\nthen, and from that day until Lincoln's proclamation and Lee's\r\nsurrender freed the negro, he never ceased to work for the abolition\r\nof slavery. The state organisation, nourished under his fostering\r\ncare, led to greater activity. Anti-slavery societies began to form in\r\nevery county and in most of the towns of some counties. Abolitionism\r\ndid not take the place of anti-Masonry, which was now rapidly on the\r\nwane; but it awakened the conscience, setting people to thinking and,\r\nthen, to talking. The great contest to abolish slavery in the British\r\nWest Indies, led by the Buxtons, the Wilberforces, and the Whitbreads,\r\nhad aroused public indignation in the United States, as well as in\r\nEngland, by the overwhelming proofs that men and women were being\r\nconstantly flogged; and that branding female slaves on the breast with\r\nred-hot iron, was used as a means of punishment, as well as of\r\nidentification. Other more revolting evidences of the horrors, which\r\nseemed to be the inevitable accompaniment of the slave system, found\r\nlodgment in American homes through the eloquence of the noted English\r\nabolition lecturer, George Thompson, then in this country; until the\r\ncruelties, characterising slavery in Jamaica, were supposed and\r\nbelieved by many to be practised in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, the principal avenue between the promoter of\r\nanti-slavery views and the voter was the United States mails, and\r\nthese were freighted with abolition documents. It is likely that\r\nHarrison Gray Otis, the wealthy and aristocratic mayor of Boston, did\r\nnot exaggerate when he advised the southern magistrate, who desired\r\nthe suppression of Garrison's _Liberator_, that \"its office was an\r\nobscure hole, its editor's only visible auxiliary a negro boy, and his\r\nsupporters a few insignificant persons of all colours;\"[286] but the\r\nSoutherners knew that from that \"obscure hole\" issued a paper of\r\nuncompromising spirit, which was profoundly impressing the people of\r\nthe United States, and their journals and orators teemed with\r\ndenunciations. The Richmond _Whig_ characterised Abolitionists as\r\n\"hell-hounds,\" warning the northern merchants that unless these\r\nfanatics were hung they would lose the benefit of southern trade. A\r\nCharleston paper threatened to cut out and \"cast upon the dunghill\"\r\nthe tongue of any one who should lecture upon the evils or immorality\r\nof slavery. The Augusta _Chronicle_ declared that if the question be\r\nlonger discussed the Southern States would secede and settle the\r\nmatter by the sword, as the only possible means of self-preservation.\r\nA prominent Alabama clergyman advised hanging every man who favoured\r\nemancipation, and the Virginia Legislature called upon the\r\nnon-slave-holding States to suppress abolition associations by penal\r\nstatutes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: Horace Greeley, _The American Conflict_, Vol. 1, p. 122,\r\n_note_.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such sentiments, it was evident to Van Buren, whose\r\nelection depended upon the Southern States, that something definite\r\nmust be done, and that nothing would be considered definite by the\r\nSouth which did not aim at the total abolition of the anti-slavery\r\nagitator. Accordingly, his friends held meetings in every county in\r\nthe State, adopting resolutions denouncing them as \"fanatics and\r\ntraitors to their country,\" and indorsing Van Buren \"as a patriot\r\nopposed to the hellish abolition factions and all their heresies.\" Van\r\nBuren himself arranged for the great meeting at Albany at which\r\nGovernor Marcy presided. \"I send you the inclosed proceedings of the\r\ncitizens of Albany,\" wrote Van Buren to the governor of Georgia, \"and\r\nI authorise you to say that I concur fully in the sentiments they\r\nadvance.\"\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon the Albany meeting, Thurlow Weed, with the\r\nforesight of a prophet, wrote in the _Evening Journal_: \"This question\r\nof slavery, when it becomes a matter of political controversy, will\r\nshake, if not unsettle, the foundations of our government. It is too\r\nfearful, and too mighty, in all its bearings and consequences, to be\r\nrecklessly mixed up in our partisan conflicts.\"[287] When the\r\nLegislature convened, in January, 1836, Governor Marcy took up the\r\nquestion in his message. \"I cannot doubt,\" he said, \"that the\r\nLegislature possesses the power to pass such penal laws as will have\r\nthe effect of preventing the citizens of this State, and residents\r\nwithin it, from availing themselves, with impunity, of the protection\r\nof its sovereignty and laws, while they are actually employed in\r\nexciting insurrection and sedition in a sister State, or engaged in\r\ntreasonable enterprises, intending to be executed therein.\"[288] Not\r\ncontent with this show of loyalty to the South on the part of his\r\nfriends, Van Buren secured the support of Silas Wright and Nathaniel\r\nP. Tallmadge for the bill, then pending in the United States Senate,\r\nprohibiting postmasters from knowingly transmitting or delivering any\r\ndocuments or papers relating to the abolition of slavery, and when the\r\nmeasure, on a motion for engrossment, received a tie vote, Van Buren\r\ncast the decisive vote in the affirmative.[289]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 319.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: _Governors' Messages_, January 5, 1836.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: \"When the bill came to a vote in the Senate, although\r\nthere was really a substantial majority against it, a tie was\r\nskilfully arranged to compel Van Buren, as Vice President, to give the\r\ncasting vote. White, the Southern Democratic candidate so seriously\r\nmenacing him, was in the Senate, and voted for the bill. Van Buren\r\nmust, it was supposed, offend the pro-slavery men by voting against\r\nthe bill, or offend the North and perhaps bruise his conscience by\r\nvoting for it. When the roll was being called, Van Buren, so Benton\r\ntells us, was out of the chair, walking behind the colonnade at the\r\nrear of the Vice President's seat. Calhoun, fearful lest he might\r\nescape the ordeal, eagerly asked where he was, and told the\r\nsergeant-at-arms to look for him. But Van Buren was ready, and at once\r\nstepped to his chair and voted for the bill. His close friend, Silas\r\nWright of New York, also voted for it. Benton says he deemed both the\r\nvotes to be political and given from policy. So they probably were....\r\nVan Buren never deserved to be called a 'Northern man with Southern\r\nprinciples.' But this vote came nearer to an excuse for the epithet\r\nthan did any other act of his career.\"--Edward M. Shepard, _Life of\r\nMartin Van Buren_, p. 277.]\r\n\r\nVan Buren's prompt action gave him the confidence and support of\r\nthree-fourths of the slave-holding States, without losing his hold\r\nupon the Democracy of the free States. Indeed, there was nothing new\r\nthat the Whigs could oppose to Van Buren. They were not ready to take\r\nthe anti-slavery side of the issue, and questions growing out of the\r\nbank controversy had practically been settled in 1832. This,\r\ntherefore, was the situation when the two parties in New York\r\nassembled in convention, in September, 1836, to nominate state\r\ncandidates. Marcy and John Tracy were without opposition. From the\r\nfirst moment he began to administer the affairs of the State, Marcy\r\nmust have felt that he had found his work at last.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs were far from being united. Henry Clay's disinclination to\r\nbecome a nominee for President resulted in two Whig candidates, Hugh\r\nL. White of Tennessee, the favourite of the southern Whigs, and\r\nWilliam Henry Harrison, preferred by the Eastern, Middle, and Western\r\nStates. This weakness was soon reflected in New York. Thurlow Weed was\r\nfull of forebodings, and William H. Seward found his law office more\r\nsatisfactory than a candidate's berth. Like Clay he was perfectly\r\nwilling another should bear the burden of inevitable defeat. So the\r\nWhigs put up Jesse Buel for governor, Gamaliel H. Barstow for\r\nlieutenant-governor, and an electoral ticket favourable to Harrison.\r\n\r\nJesse Buel was not a brilliant man. He was neither a thinker, like\r\nSeward, nor an orator, like Granger; but he was wise, wealthy, and\r\neminently respectable, with enough of the statesman in him to be able\r\nto accept established facts and not to argue with the inexorable.\r\nYears before, he had founded the Albany _Argus_, editing it with\r\nability and great success. Through its influence he became state\r\nprinter, succeeding Solomon Southwick, after the latter's quarrel with\r\nGovernor Tompkins over the Bank of America. This was in 1813. Three\r\nyears later Thurlow Weed, then a young man of nineteen, worked for him\r\nas a journeyman printer. \"From January till April,\" he writes, \"I\r\nuniformly reached the office before daylight, and seldom failed to\r\nfind Mr. Buel at his case, setting type by a tallow candle and smoking\r\na long pipe.\" Buel made so much money that the party managers invited\r\nhim to let others, equally deserving, have a turn at the state\r\nprinting. So he went into the Assembly, distinguishing himself as an\r\nable, practical legislator. But he gradually drew away from the\r\nDemocrats, as their financial policy became more pronounced; and upon\r\nthe organisation of the Whig party gave it his support. Had he chosen\r\nhe might have been its candidate for governor in 1834; and it is\r\ndifficult to understand why he should have accepted, in 1836, with\r\nlittle expectation of an election, what he declined two years before\r\nwhen success seemed probable.\r\n\r\nGamaliel H. Barstow had been a Clintonian and an anti-Clintonian, a\r\nfollower and a pursuer of Van Buren, an Adams man and an\r\nAnti-Mason--everything, in fact, except a Federalist. But, under\r\nwhatever standard he fought, and in whatever body he sat, he was a\r\nrecognised leader, full of spirit, fire, and force. In 1824, he had\r\nstood with James Tallmadge and Henry Wheaton at the head of the Adams\r\nparty; in 1831, he had accompanied John C. Spencer and William H.\r\nSeward to the national anti-masonic convention at Baltimore; and, in\r\nthe long, exciting debate upon the bill giving the people power to\r\nchoose presidential electors, he exhibited the consummate shrewdness\r\nand sagacity of an experienced legislator. There was nothing sinister\r\nor vindictive about him; but he had an unsparing tongue, and he\r\ndelighted to indulge it. This is what he did in 1836. Having turned\r\nhis back upon the Democratic party, the campaign to him became an\r\noccasion for contrasting the past and \"its blighting Regency\r\nmajorities\" with the future of a new party, which, no doubt, seemed to\r\nhim and to others purer and brighter, since the longer it was excluded\r\nfrom power the less opportunity it had for making mistakes.\r\n\r\nBut 1836 was a year of great prosperity. The undue depression of 1835\r\nwas now succeeded by commercial activity and an era of expansion and\r\ninflation. Visionary schemes were everywhere present. Real estate\r\nvalues doubled, farms were platted into village lots, wild lands were\r\nturned into farms, and a new impulse was given to legitimate and\r\nillegitimate enterprises. Stocks rose, labour went up, farm products\r\nsold at higher prices, and the whole country responded to the\r\nadvantages of the money plethora. Democracy rode on the crest of the\r\nwave, and Jackson's financial policy was accepted with joy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the Whig party, hoping to strengthen its numbers in\r\nCongress, did not relax its zeal. When the vote, however, revealed\r\nnearly thirty thousand majority for Marcy[290] and the Van Buren\r\nelectoral ticket, with ninety-four Democrats in the Assembly and only\r\none Whig in the Senate, it made Thurlow Weed despair for the Republic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: William L. Marcy, 166,122; Jesse Buel, 136,648--_Civil\r\nList, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSEWARD ELECTED GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n1836-1838\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming defeat of the Whigs, in 1836, left a single rift in\r\nthe dark cloud through which gleamed a ray of substantial hope. It was\r\nplain to the most cautious business man that if banking had been\r\nhighly remunerative, with the United States Bank controlling\r\ngovernment deposits, it must become more productive after Jackson had\r\ntransferred these deposits to state institutions; and what was plain\r\nto the conservative banker, was equally patent to the reckless\r\nspeculator. The legislatures of 1834 and 1835, therefore, became noted\r\nas well as notorious for the large number of bank charters granted. As\r\nthe months passed, increased demands for liberal loans created an\r\nincreasing demand for additional banks, and the greater the demand the\r\ngreater the strife for charters. Under the restraining law of the\r\nState, abundant provision had been made for a fair distribution of\r\nbank stocks; but the dominant party, quick to take an advantage\r\nhelpful to its friends, carefully selected commissioners who would\r\ndistribute it only among their political followers. At first it went\r\nto merchants or capitalists in the locality of the bank; but\r\ngradually, Albany politicians began to participate, and then,\r\nprominent state officers, judges, legislators and their relatives and\r\nconfidential friends, many of whom resold the stock at a premium of\r\ntwenty to twenty-five per cent. before the first payment had been\r\nmade. Thus, the distribution of stock became a public scandal,\r\ndeplored in the messages of the Governor and assailed by the press.\r\n\"The unclean drippings of venal legislation,\" the New York _Evening\r\nPost_ called it. But no remedy was applied. The Governor, in spite of\r\nhis regrets, signed every charter the Legislature granted, and the\r\ncommissioners, as if ignorant of the provisions to secure a fair\r\ndistribution of the stock, continued to evade the law with boldness\r\nand great facility.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Democratic party in New York City, who believed that\r\nbanking, like any other business, ought to be open to competition, had\r\norganised an equal rights party in 1834 to oppose all monopolies, and\r\nthe bank restraining law in particular. Several meetings were held\r\nduring the summer. Finally, in October, both factions of Tammany Hall\r\nattempted forcibly to control its proceedings, and, in the contest,\r\nthe lights were extinguished. The Equal Righters promptly relighted\r\nthem with loco-foco or friction matches and continued the meeting.\r\nFrom this circumstance they were called Locofocos, a name which the\r\nWhigs soon applied to the whole Democratic party.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Rights party was not long-lived. Two years spanned its\r\nactivity, and four or five thousand votes measured its strength; but,\r\nwhile it lasted, it was earnest and the exponent of good principles.\r\nIn 1836, these people held a state convention at Utica, issued a\r\ndeclaration of principles, and nominated a state and congressional\r\nticket. In New York City, the centre of their activity, Frederick A.\r\nTallmadge was put up for state senator and Edward Curtis for Congress,\r\ntwo reputable Whigs; and, to aid them, the Whig party fused\r\nsuccessfully with the Equal Righters, electing their whole ticket.\r\nThis victory was the one ray of hope that came to the Whigs out of the\r\ncontest of 1836. It proved that some people were uneasy and resentful.\r\n\r\nBut other Whig victories were soon to follow. Reference has already\r\nbeen made to the unprecedented prosperity that characterised the year\r\n1836. This era of expansion and speculative enterprises, which began\r\nwith the transfer of government deposits, continued at high pressure\r\nunder the influence of the newly chartered banks. With such a money\r\nplethora, schemes and projects expanded and inflated, until success\r\nseemed to turn the heads of the whole population. So wild was the\r\npassion for new enterprises, that one had only to announce a scheme to\r\nfind people ready to take shares in it. Two per cent. a month did not\r\ndeter borrowers who expected to make one hundred per cent. before the\r\nend of the year. In vain did the Governor inveigh against this\r\n\"unregulated spirit of speculation.\" As the year advanced, men grew\r\nmore reckless, until stocks and shares were quickly purchased at any\r\nprice without the slightest care as to the risk taken.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the end of this epoch of insane speculation was felt,\r\nearly in the spring of 1837, by a money pressure of unexampled\r\nseverity. Scarcely had its effect reached the interior counties,\r\nbefore every bank in the country suspended specie payments. Then\r\nconfidence gave way, and tens of thousands of people, who had been\r\nwealthy or in comfortable circumstances, waked up to the awful\r\nrealisation of their bankruptcy and ruin. The panic of 1837 reached\r\nthe proportions of a national calamity. Most men did not then know the\r\nreason for the crash, and the knowledge of those who did, brought\r\nlittle comfort. But, gradually, the country recognised that the\r\nprosperity of a nation is not increased in proportion to the quantity\r\nof paper money issued, unless such currency be maintained at its full\r\nvalue, convertible, at pleasure, into hard cash--the money standard of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the Legislature had not adjourned when the crash\r\ncame, and, without a moment's delay, it suspended for one year the\r\nsection of the Safety Fund act forbidding banks to issue notes after\r\nrefusing to pay them in coin on demand; but it refused to suspend the\r\nact, passed in March, 1835, prohibiting the issue or circulation of\r\nbills under the denomination of five dollars. This left the people\r\nwithout small bills, and, as New York banks dared not issue them,\r\nnecessity forced into circulation foreign bills, issued by solvent and\r\ninsolvent banks, the losses from which fell largely upon the poorer\r\nclasses who could not discriminate between the genuine and the\r\nspurious. So great was the inconvenience and loss suffered by the\r\ncontinuance of this act, that the people petitioned the Governor to\r\ncall an extra session of the Legislature for its repeal; but Marcy\r\ndeclined, for the reason that the Legislature had already refused to\r\ngive the banks the desired authority. Thus, the citizens of New York,\r\nstaggering under a panic common to the whole country, were compelled\r\nto suffer the additional hardships of an irredeemable, and, for the\r\nmost part, worthless currency, known as \"shin-plasters.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these \"hard times,\" occurred the election in November,\r\n1837. The New York municipal election, held in the preceding spring\r\nand resulting, with the help of the Equal Righters, in the choice of a\r\nWhig mayor, had prepared the way for a surprise; yet no one imagined\r\nthat a political revolution was imminent. But the suffering people\r\nwere angry, and, like a whirlwind, the Whigs swept nearly every county\r\nin the State. Of one hundred and twenty-eight assemblymen, they\r\nelected one hundred and one, and six of the eight senators. It\r\nhappened, too, that as the triennial election of sheriffs and clerks\r\noccurred this year, the choice of these officers swelled the triumph\r\ninto a victory that made it the harder to overthrow. In a moment, the\r\nelection of 1837 had given the Whigs a powerful leverage in local\r\ncontests, enabling them to build up a party that could be disciplined\r\nas well as organised. To add to their strength, the Legislature, when\r\nit convened, in January, 1838, proceeded to take the \"spoils.\" Luther\r\nBradish was chosen speaker, Orville L. Holley surveyor-general, and\r\nGamaliel L. Barstow state treasurer. It also suspended for two years\r\nthe act prohibiting banks from issuing small bills, passed a general\r\nbanking law, and almost unanimously voted four millions for enlarging\r\nthe Erie canal.\r\n\r\nAlthough the spring elections of 1838 showed a decided falling off in\r\nthe Whig vote, hopes of carrying the State in November were so well\r\nfounded that Whig candidates for governor appeared in plenty. Looking\r\nback upon the contest from a distance, especially with the present\r\nknowledge of his superlative fitness for high place, it seems strange\r\nthat William H. Seward should not have had an open way in the\r\nconvention. But Francis Granger had also won the admiration of his\r\nparty by twice leading a forlorn hope. Amidst crushing defeat he had\r\nnever shown weariness, and his happy disposition kept him in friendly\r\ntouch with his party. The Chenango people were especially ardent in\r\nhis support. Twice he had forced their canal project through a hostile\r\nAssembly, and they did not forget that, in the hour of triumph, Seward\r\nopposed it. Besides, Granger had distinguished himself in Congress,\r\nresisting the policy of Jackson and Van Buren with forceful argument\r\nand ready tact. He was certainly a man to be proud of, and his\r\nadmirers insisted with great pertinacity that he should now be the\r\nnominee for governor.\r\n\r\nThere was another formidable candidate in the field. Luther Bradish\r\nhad proved an unusually able speaker, courteous in deportment, and\r\nfirm and resolute in his rulings at a time of considerable political\r\nexcitement. He had entered the Assembly from Franklin in 1828, and,\r\nhaving early embraced anti-Masonry with Weed, Granger, and Seward,\r\nwas, with them, a leader in the organisation of the Whig party. The\r\nnorthern counties insisted that his freedom from party controversies\r\nmade him peculiarly available, and, while the supporters of other\r\ncandidates were quarrelling, it was their intention, if possible, to\r\nnominate him. Seward and Granger were eager for the nomination, but\r\nneither seems to have encouraged the ill-will which their followers\r\nexhibited. Indeed, Seward evidenced a disposition to withdraw; and he\r\nwould doubtless have done so, had not his friends, and those of\r\nGranger, thought it better to let a convention decide. As the campaign\r\ngrew older, the canvass proceeded with asperity. Granger's adherents\r\naccused Seward of an unjust conspiracy to destroy him, and of having\r\ncanvassed the State, personally or by agents, to secure the prize even\r\nat the cost of a party division. They charged him with oppressing the\r\nsettlers in Chautauqua, with editing the Albany _Journal_, with\r\nregulating the Bank of the United States, and controlling the\r\nmovements of Henry Clay. \"I am already so wearied of it,\" Seward\r\nwrote, \"that, if left to myself, I should withdraw instantly and\r\nforever. I am ill-fitted for competition with brethren and friends.\r\nBut with a clear conscience and greater magnanimity than there is\r\nmanifested toward me, I shall go safely through all this storm.\"[291]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 366.]\r\n\r\nThe confidence disclosed in the closing sentence was due largely to\r\nhis confidence in Thurlow Weed. The editor of the Albany _Journal_\r\nseriously desired to take no part in the choice of delegates, since\r\nhis personal and political relations with all the candidates were\r\nintimate and confidential; but he had known Granger longer than the\r\nothers, and, if controlled by personal friendship, he must have\r\nfavoured the Ontario candidate. Weed, however, believed that Seward's\r\nnomination would awaken greater enthusiasm, especially among young\r\nmen, thus giving the ticket its best chance of success. At the last\r\nmoment, therefore, he declared in favour of the Auburn statesman.\r\n\r\nThe sequel showed that his help came none too soon. Four informal\r\nballots were taken, and, on the following day the formal and final\r\none. The first gave Seward 52, Granger 39, and Bradish 29, with 4 for\r\nEdwards of New York. This was supposed to be Granger's limit. On the\r\nsecond ballot, Bradish's friends transferred thirteen votes to him,\r\nmaking Seward 60, Granger 52, Bradish 10, and Edwards 3. If this was a\r\nsurprise to the friends of Seward, the third ballot was a tremendous\r\nshock, for Seward fell off to 59, and Granger got 60. Bradish had 8.\r\nThen Weed went to work. Though he had understood that Granger, except\r\nin a few counties, had little strength, the last ballot plainly showed\r\nhim to be the popular candidate; and during an intermission between\r\nthe third and fourth ballots, the _Journal's_ editor exhibited an\r\ninfluence few men in the State have ever exercised. The convention was\r\nmade up of the strongest and most independent men in the party. Nearly\r\nall had held seats in the state or national legislature, or had\r\noccupied other important office. Experience had taught them to act\r\nupon their own convictions. The delegates interested in the Chenango\r\nValley canal were especially obstinate and formidable. \"Weed,\" said\r\none of them, \"tell me to do anything else; tell me to jump out of the\r\nwindow and break my neck, and I will do it to oblige you; but don't\r\nask me to desert Granger!\"[292] Yet the quiet, good-natured Weed, his\r\nhand softly purring the knee of his listener as he talked--never\r\nexcited, never vehement, but sympathetic, logical, prophetic--had his\r\nway. The fourth ballot gave Seward 67, Granger 48, Bradish 8. The work\r\nwas done. When the convention reassembled the next morning, on motion\r\nof a warm supporter of Granger, the nomination was made unanimous, and\r\nBradish was named for lieutenant-governor by acclamation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 373.]\r\n\r\nMuch disappointment was exhibited by Granger's friends, especially the\r\nold anti-Mason farmers who were inclined to reproach Weed with\r\ndisloyalty. Granger himself stoically accepted defeat and zealously\r\nsupported the ticket. He had said to a departing delegate, \"if either\r\nMr. Seward or Mr. Bradish attain a majority at the informal ballot, my\r\nfriends must give the successful competitor their united support.\"[293]\r\nHow heartily Seward would have responded under like circumstances is\r\nevidenced by his action when a premature report went forth of\r\nGranger's selection. Being informed of it, Seward at once told his\r\nfriends that Auburn must be the first to ratify, and immediately set\r\nto work preparing resolutions for the meeting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: _Ibid._, p. 374.]\r\n\r\nThurlow Weed was pre-eminently a practical politician. He believed in\r\ntaking advantage of every opportunity to strengthen his own party and\r\nweaken the adversary, and he troubled himself little about the means\r\nemployed. He preferred to continue the want of small bills for another\r\nyear rather than allow the opposite party to benefit by a repeal of\r\nthe obnoxious law; he approved Van Buren's course in the infamous\r\nFellows-Allen controversy; and, had he been governor in place of John\r\nJay in 1800, the existing Legislature would undoubtedly have been\r\nreconvened in extra session, and presidential electors chosen\r\nfavourable to his own party, as Hamilton wanted. But, at the bottom of\r\nhis nature, there was bed-rock principle from which no pressure could\r\nswerve him. He could exclaim with Emerson, \"I will say those things\r\nwhich I have meditated for their own sake and not for the first time\r\nwith a view to that occasion.\" In these words is the secret of his\r\nrelation to the Whig party. He asked no office, and he gave only the\r\nripe fruit of his meditative life. It is not to be supposed that, in\r\n1838, he saw in the young man at Auburn the astute United States\r\nSenator of the fifties; or the still greater secretary of state of the\r\nCivil War; but he had seen enough of Seward to discern the qualities\r\nof mind and heart that lifted him onto heights which extended his\r\nhorizon beyond that of most men, enabling him to keep his bearing in\r\nthe midst of great excitement, and, finally, in the presence of war\r\nitself. Seward saw fewer things, perhaps, than the more active and\r\neloquent Granger, but Weed knew that he saw more deeply.[294]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: \"Apart from politics, I liked Seward, though not blind\r\nto his faults. His natural instincts were humane and progressive. He\r\nhated slavery and all its belongings, though a seeming necessity\r\nconstrained him to write, in 1838, to this intensely pro-slavery city,\r\na pro-slavery letter, which was at war with his real, or at least with\r\nhis subsequent convictions. Though of Democratic parentage, he had\r\nbeen an Adams man, an anti-Mason, and was now thoroughly a Whig. The\r\npolicy of more extensive and vigorous internal improvement had no more\r\nzealous champion. By nature, genial and averse to pomp, ceremony, and\r\nformality, few public men of his early prime were better calculated to\r\nattract and fascinate young men of his own party, and holding views\r\naccordant on most points with his.... Weed was of coarser mould and\r\nfibre than Seward--tall, robust, dark-featured, shrewd, resolute, and\r\nnot over-scrupulous--keen-sighted, though not far-seeing.\"--Horace\r\nGreeley, _Recollections of a Busy Life_, pp. 311, 312.]\r\n\r\nThe Democratic state convention assembled at Herkimer on September 12,\r\nand unanimously renominated William L. Marcy and John Tracy. Marcy\r\nhad made an able governor for three consecutive terms. His declaration\r\nthat \"to the victors belong the spoils\" had not impaired his\r\ninfluence, since all parties practised, if they did not preach it;\r\nand, although he stultified himself by practically recommending and\r\nfinally approving the construction of the Chenango canal, which he\r\nbitterly opposed as comptroller, he had lost no friends. Canal\r\nbuilding was in accord with the spirit of the times. A year later, he\r\nhad recommended an enlargement of the Erie canal; but when he\r\ndiscovered that the Chenango project would cost two millions instead\r\nof one, and the Erie enlargement twelve millions instead of six, he\r\nprotested against further improvements until the Legislature provided\r\nmeans for paying interest on the money already borrowed. He clearly\r\nsaw that the \"unregulated spirit of speculation\" would lead to ruin;\r\nand, to counteract it, he appealed to the Legislature, seeking to\r\ninfluence the distribution of bank stock along lines set forth in the\r\nlaw. But Marcy failed to enforce his precepts with the veto. In\r\nrefusing, also, to reassemble the Legislature, for the repeal of the\r\nSmall Bills act, the passage of which he had recommended in 1835, he\r\ngave the _Evening Post_ opportunity to assail him as \"a weak,\r\ncringing, indecisive man, the mere tool of a monopoly junto--their\r\nconvenient instrument.\"\r\n\r\nMarcy held office under difficult conditions. The panic, coming in the\r\nsummer of 1837, was enough to shatter the nerves of any executive;\r\nbut, to the panic, was now added the Canadian rebellion which occurred\r\nin the autumn of 1837. Though not much of a rebellion, William L.\r\nMcKenzie's appeal for aid to the friends of liberty aroused hundreds\r\nof sympathetic Americans living along the border. Navy Island, above\r\nthe Falls of Niagara, was made the headquarters of a provisional\r\ngovernment, from which McKenzie issued a proclamation offering a\r\nreward for the capture of the governor-general of Canada and promising\r\nthree hundred acres of land to each recruit.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian authorities effectually guarded the border, and\r\ndestroyed the _Caroline_, presumably an insurgent steamer, lying at\r\nSchlosser's dock on the American side. In the conflict, one member of\r\nthe crew was killed, and several wounded. The steamer proved to be an\r\nAmerican vessel, owned by New York parties, and its destruction\r\ngreatly increased the indignation against Canada; but Governor Marcy\r\ndid not hesitate to call upon the people to refrain from unlawful acts\r\nwithin the territory of the United States; and, to enforce his\r\nproclamation, supplied General Scott, now in command of the Canadian\r\nfrontier, with a force of militia. The American troops quickly forced\r\nthe abandonment of Navy Island, scattered the insurgents and their\r\nallies to secret retreats, and broke up the guerrilla warfare. The\r\nloss of life among the patriots, due to their audacity and incompetent\r\nleadership, was considerable, and the treatment of prisoners harsh and\r\nin some instances inhuman. Many young men of intelligence and\r\ncharacter were banished for life to Van Dieman's Land, McKenzie was\r\nthrown into a Canadian dungeon, and, among others, Van Schoulty, a\r\nbrave young officer and refugee from Poland, who led an unsuccessful\r\nattack upon Prescott, was executed. Small as was the uprising, it\r\ncreated an intense dislike of Marcy among the friends of those who\r\nparticipated in it.\r\n\r\nStill another political splinter was festering in Marcy's side.\r\nSeveral leading Democrats, who had sustained Jackson in his war upon\r\nthe United States Bank, and in his removal of the deposits, refused to\r\nadopt Van Buren's sub-treasury scheme, proposed to the extra session\r\nof Congress, convened in September, 1837. This measure meant the\r\ndisuse of banks as fiscal agents of the government, and the\r\ncollection, safekeeping, and disbursement of public moneys by treasury\r\nofficials. The banks, of course, opposed it; and thousands who had\r\nshouted, \"Down with the United States Bank,\" changed their cry to\r\n\"Down with Van Buren and the sub-treasury scheme.\" Among those\r\nopposing it, in New York, Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, a Democratic United\r\nStates senator, took the lead, calling a state convention to meet at\r\nSyracuse. This convention immediately burned its bridges. It\r\ndenounced Van Buren, it opposed Marcy, and it indorsed Seward. Behind\r\nit were bank officers and stockholders who were to lose the privilege\r\nof loaning the money of the United States for their own benefit, and\r\nthe harder it struck them the more liberally they paid for fireworks\r\nand for shouters.\r\n\r\nIf trouble confronted the Democrats, discouragement oppressed the\r\nWhigs. Under the direction of Gerrit Smith the Abolitionists were on\r\nthe war-path, questioning Seward as to the propriety of granting\r\nfugitive slaves a fair trial by jury, of abolishing distinctions in\r\nconstitutional rights founded solely on complexion, and of repealing\r\nthe law authorising the importation of slaves into the State and their\r\ndetention as such during a period of nine months. Seward avowed his\r\nfirm faith in trial by jury and his opposition to all \"human bondage,\"\r\nbut he declined making ante-election pledges. He preferred to wait, he\r\nsaid, until each case came before him for decision. Seward undoubtedly\r\ntook the wise course; but he did not satisfy the extremists\r\nrepresented by Smith, and many of the Whig leaders became\r\npanic-stricken. \"The Philistines are upon us,\" wrote Millard Fillmore,\r\nwho was canvassing the State. \"I now regard all as lost irrevocably.\r\nWe shall never be able to burst the withes. Thank God, I can endure it\r\nas long as they, but I am sick of our Whig party. It can never be in\r\nthe ascendant.\"[295]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n60.]\r\n\r\nFrancis Granger was no less alarmed. He estimated the Abolitionist\r\nvote at twenty thousand, \"and before the grand contest of 1840,\" he\r\nwrote Weed, \"they will control one-fourth the votes of the State. They\r\nare engaged in it with the same honest purpose that governed the great\r\nmass of Anti-Masons.\"[296] The young candidate at Auburn was also in\r\ndespair. \"I fear the State is lost,\" he wrote Weed on November 4.\r\n\"This conclusion was forced upon me strongly by news from the southern\r\ntier of counties, and is confirmed by an analogy in Ohio. But I will\r\nnot stop to reason on the causes. Your own sagacity has doubtless\r\noften considered them earlier and more forcibly than mine.\"[297]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 296: _Ibid._, p. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 61.]\r\n\r\nBut Horace Greeley did not share these gloomy forebodings. He was then\r\nengaged in editing the _Jeffersonian_, a weekly journal of eight\r\npages, which had been established in February solely as a campaign\r\nnewspaper. His regular business was the publication of the _New\r\nYorker_, a journal of literature and general intelligence. During the\r\ncampaign he consented to spend two days of each week at Albany making\r\nup the _Jeffersonian_, which was issued from the office of the\r\n_Evening Journal_, and he was doing this work with the indefatigable\r\nindustry and marvellous ability that marked his character.\r\n\r\nGreeley had battled for a place in the world after the manner of\r\nThurlow Weed. He was born on a New Hampshire farm, he had worked on a\r\nVermont farm, and for a time it seemed to him as if he must forever\r\nremain on a farm; but after a few winters of schooling he started over\r\nthe Vermont hills to learn the printer's trade. A boy was not needed\r\nin Whitehall, and he pushed on to Poultney. There he found work for\r\nfour years until the _Northern Spectator_ expired. Then he went back\r\nto the farm. But newspaper life in a small town had made him ambitious\r\nto try his fortunes in a city, and, journeying from one printing\r\noffice to another, he finally drifted, in 1831, at the age of twenty,\r\ninto New York.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Greeley's life had resembled Weed's only in his\r\nvoracious appetite for reading newspapers. He cared little for the\r\nboys about town and less for the sports of youth; he could dispense\r\nwith sleep, and wasted no time thinking about what he should eat or\r\nwear; but books, and especially newspapers, were read with the avidity\r\nthat a well-fed threshing machine devours a stack of wheat. He seemed\r\nto have only one ambition--the acquisition of knowledge and the career\r\nof a man of letters, and in his efforts to succeed, he ignored forms\r\nand social usages, forgot that he had a physical body to care for, and\r\ndetested man-worship. Standing at last before a printer's case on\r\nBroadway, he was able to watch, almost from the beginning, the great\r\npolitical drama in which he was destined to play so great a part.\r\nSeward had just entered the State Senate; Weed, having recently\r\nestablished the _Evening Journal_, was massing the Anti-Masons and\r\nNational Republicans for their last campaign; William Lloyd Garrison\r\nhad issued the first number of the _Liberator_; Gerrit Smith, already\r\nin possession of his father's vast estate, still clung to the Liberian\r\ncolonisation scheme; and Van Buren, not yet returned from England, was\r\nabout entering upon the last stage of his phenomenally successful\r\npolitical career. Politicians for the first time disturbed about the\r\ntariff, the bank, and internal improvements, had come to the parting\r\nof the ways; the old order of things had ended under John Quincy\r\nAdams--the new had just commenced under Andrew Jackson. But the young\r\ncompositor needed no guide-post to direct his political footsteps. In\r\n1834, he had established the _New Yorker_ and those who read it became\r\nWhigs. His mind acted upon other minds of a certain constitution with\r\nwonderful magnetism, attracting thousands of readers by his marvellous\r\ngift of expression and the broad sympathies and clear discernments\r\nthat characterised his writings. He had his own ideas about the\r\nnecessity for reforms, and he seems easily to have fallen a victim to\r\ncountless delusions and illusions which young visionaries and\r\ngray-headed theorists brought to him; but, in spite of remonstrances\r\nand crushing opposition, he stood resolutely for whatever awoke the\r\nstrongest emotions of his nature.\r\n\r\nThurlow Weed had been a constant reader of the _New Yorker_. He did\r\nnot know the name of its editor and had never taken the trouble to\r\ninquire, but when a cheap weekly Whig newspaper was needed for a\r\nvigorous campaign in 1838, the editor of the _New Yorker_, whoever he\r\nmight be, seemed the proper man to edit and manage it. Going to New\r\nYork, he called at the Ann Street office and found himself in the\r\npresence of a young man, slender, light-haired, slightly stooping, and\r\nvery near-sighted, who introduced himself as Horace Greeley. At the\r\nmoment, he was standing at the case, with coat off and sleeves rolled\r\nup, setting type with the ease and rapidity of an expert. \"When I\r\ninformed him of the object of my visit,\" says Weed, \"he was, of\r\ncourse, surprised, but evidently gratified. Nor was his surprise and\r\ngratification diminished to learn that I was drawn to him without any\r\nother reason or information but such as I had derived from the columns\r\nof the _New Yorker_. He suggested the _Jeffersonian_ as the name for\r\nthe new paper, and the first number appeared in February, 1838.\"[298]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 466.]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the privileges of genius to discern the genius of others;\r\nbut even Thurlow Weed could not have dreamed that he was giving\r\nopportunity to a man whose name was to rank higher than his own in\r\nhistory. There was a certain affinity between the intellectual nature\r\nof the two men, and they had now a common object. Both were\r\njournalists of tremendous energy, indomitable industry, and marvellous\r\ngifts; but Weed was a politician, Greeley a political preacher. Weed's\r\ninfluence lay in his remarkable judgment, his genius for diplomacy,\r\nand his rare gift of controlling individuals by personal appeal and by\r\nthe overpowering mastery of his intellect; Greeley's supremacy grew\r\nout of his broad sympathies with the human race and his matchless\r\nability to write. Weed's field of operations was confined largely to\r\nthe State of New York and to delegates and men of influence who\r\nassemble at national conventions; Greeley preached to the whole\r\ncountry, sweeping along like a prairie fire and converting men to his\r\nviews as easily as steel filings are attracted to the magnet. From the\r\noutset he was above dictation. He lacked judgment, and at times\r\ngreatly grieved the friends who were willing to follow him through\r\nfire and flood; but once his mind was made up he surrendered his\r\nunderstanding, his consciousness of convictions, of duty, and of\r\npublic good, to no man or set of men. \"I trust we can never be\r\nenemies,\" he once wrote Weed, \"but better anything than I should feel\r\nthe weight of chains about my neck, that I should write and act with\r\nan eye to any man's pleasure, rather than to the highest good.\"[299]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n97.]\r\n\r\nAs the editor of the _Jeffersonian_, which now quickly won a multitude\r\nof readers, he did his work with marked ability, discussing measures\r\ncalmly and forcibly, and with an influence that baffled his opponents\r\nand surprised his friends. Greeley seems never to have been an\r\nimmature writer. His felicity of expression and ability to shade\r\nthought, with a power of appeal and invective that belongs to\r\nexperience and mature age, came to him, as they did to Hamilton,\r\nbefore he was out of his teens, and whether he was right or whether he\r\nwas wrong, he was always the most interesting, always the most\r\ncommanding figure in American journalism in the epoch-making political\r\ncontroversies of his day.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs thought it a happy omen that election day, November 7, came\r\nthis year on the anniversary of General Harrison's victory at\r\nTippecanoe. As the returns came in Seward's friends grew more elated,\r\nand on Saturday, the 11th, Weed covered the entire first page of the\r\n_Evening Journal_ with the picture of an eagle, having outspread wings\r\nand bearing in its beak the word \"Victory.\" It was the first\r\nappearance in politics of this American bird, which was destined to\r\nplay a part in all future celebrations of the kind. The completed\r\nreturns showed that the Whigs had elected Seward and Bradish by ten\r\nthousand four hundred and twenty-one majority,[300] five of the eight\r\nsenators, and nearly two-thirds of the assemblymen. \"Well, dear\r\nSeward,\" wrote Weed, \"we are victorious; God be thanked--gratefully\r\nand devoutly thanked.\"[301] Seward was no less affected. \"It is a\r\nfearful post I have coveted,\" he wrote; \"I shudder at my temerity....\r\nIndeed, I feel just now as if your zeal had been blind; but I may,\r\nperhaps, get over this. God grant, at all events, that I be spared\r\nfrom committing the sin of ingratitude. I hate it as the foulest in\r\nthe catalogue.\"[302]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 300: William H. Seward, 192,882; William L. Marcy,\r\n182,461.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 301: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 379.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n61.]\r\n\r\nMarcy seemed to accept his defeat good-naturedly. \"Even before the\r\nballot-boxes were closed,\" he wrote, facetiously, \"I had partly\r\npersuaded myself to engage in a work for _my_ posterity, by writing\r\nthe history of the rise, progress, and termination of the Regency. It\r\nwill embrace the transactions of the golden days of the Republic\r\n(Empire State). It began with my entrance into public life, and\r\nterminates with my exit from it. The figures in the tableau will not\r\nbe of the largest size, but the ascendancy of honest men, for such I\r\nthink them to have been (_Ilium fuit_), will be interesting on account\r\nof great rarity.\" But, to the same friend, a few weeks later, he took\r\na desponding view, expressing the fear that the power which had passed\r\nfrom the Democratic party would not return to as honest hands. His\r\nfinancial condition, too, caused him much uneasiness. He had given\r\neighteen years to the State, he said, the largest portion of an active\r\nand vigorous life, and now found himself poorer than when he took\r\noffice. \"If my acquisitions in a pecuniary way have probably been less\r\nand my labours and exertions greater,\" he asks, \"what compensating\r\nadvantages are to be brought into the calculation to balance the\r\naccount?\" An office-holder rarely asks such a question until thrown\r\nout of a position; while in office, it is evident he thinks the\r\nprivilege of holding it sufficient compensation; otherwise, it may be\r\npresumed, he would resign. Marcy, however, was not forgotten. Indeed,\r\nhis political career had scarcely begun, since the governorship became\r\nonly a stepping-stone to continued honours. Within a few months,\r\nPresident Van Buren appointed him, under the convention of April,\r\n1839, to the Mexican Claims Commission, and a few years later he was\r\nto become a member of two Cabinets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE DEFEAT OF VAN BUREN FOR PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n1840\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Seward's election, the Whig party in New York may be fairly\r\ndescribed as under the control of Thurlow Weed, who became known as\r\nthe \"Dictator.\" Although no less drastic and persevering, perhaps,\r\nthan DeWitt Clinton's, it was a control far different in method.\r\nClinton did not disguise his power. He was satisfied in his own mind\r\nthat he knew better than any other how to guide his party and govern\r\nhis followers, and he acted accordingly--dogmatic, overbearing, often\r\nfar from amiable, sometimes unendurable, to those around him. Weed, on\r\nthe contrary, was patient, sympathetic, gentle, and absolutely without\r\nasperity. \"My dear Weed,\" wrote Seward on December 14, 1838, \"the\r\nsweetness of his temper inclines me to love my tyrant. I had no idea\r\nthat dictators were such amiable creatures.\"[303] In a humourous vein,\r\nWilliam Kent, the gifted son of the Chancellor, addressed him. \"Mr.\r\nDictator, the whole State is on your shoulders. I take it, some future\r\nchronicler, in reciting the annals of New York during this period, in\r\nevery respect equal to England in the time of Elizabeth, will devote\r\nthe brightest colours to 'the celebrated Thurlow Weed, who so long\r\nfilled the office of Governor Seward during his lengthened and\r\nprosperous administration.' It behooves you, therefore, to act\r\ncircumspectly, and particularly in the advice you give the Governor as\r\nto appointments to office.\"[304]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n63. F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 381.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n72.]\r\n\r\nFew chapters of personal history can be more interesting than that\r\nwhich tells of the strange, subtle influence exercised by Weed over\r\nthe mind of Seward; but it is doubtful if there was conscious control\r\nat any time. Certainly Seward never felt \"the weight of chains\" about\r\nhis neck. Weed probably saw good reason to believe that in Seward he\r\ncould have just the sort of an associate who would suit all his\r\npurposes, since their views of public affairs and their estimate of\r\npublic men rarely differed. \"Our relations had become so intimate,\" he\r\nsays, \"and our sentiments and sympathies proved so congenial, that our\r\ninterests, pursuits, and hopes of promoting each other's welfare and\r\nhappiness became identical.\"[305] Weed seemed to glory in Seward's\r\nsuccess, and Seward was supremely happy in and proud of Weed's\r\nfriendship. Weed and Greeley were so differently constituted that,\r\nbetween them, such a relation could not exist, although at times it\r\nseemed to give Greeley real pain that it was so. \"I rise early from a\r\nbed of sleepless thought,\" he once wrote Weed, \"to explain that we\r\ndiffer radically on the bank question, and I begin to fear we do on\r\nthe general policy and objects of political controversy.\"[306] But\r\nthere were no such sleepless nights for Seward. Looking back upon four\r\nyears of gubernatorial life, he opens his heart freely to the friend\r\nof his young manhood. \"Without your aid,\" he declares, \"how helpless\r\nwould have been my prospect of reaching the elevation from which I am\r\nto-day descending. How could I have sustained myself there; how could\r\nI have secured the joyous reflections of this hour, but for the\r\nconfidence I so undenyingly reposed on your affection?\"[307] It was not\r\nSeward's nature to depend upon somebody to have his path in life or\r\nhis ways of thinking pointed out to him; nor did he have the weakness\r\nof many highly cultured and gifted men who believe too much in the\r\nsupremacy of intellect and culture. On the contrary, he had a way of\r\nspeaking out his own honest thoughts, and would have despised\r\nhimself, as much as would Greeley, if it had been necessary to enjoy\r\nany one's friendship on terms of humiliation. It was his nature, as\r\nwell as his wish, to share with Weed the benefit of the latter's\r\nalmost infallible judgment in political matters. In this way, Weed,\r\nmore than either realised, had great influence with Seward. But Weed\r\nwas no more the directing mind of the administration of Seward than\r\nwas Hamilton of Washington's, or Van Buren of Jackson's, or Seward of\r\nLincoln's. Many anecdotes were told illustrative of this influence,\r\nwhich serve to show how strongly the notion obtained in the minds of\r\nthe common people that Weed was really \"the Dictator.\" The best,\r\nassociated Seward with his invariable custom of riding outside the\r\ncoach while smoking his after-dinner cigar. The whip, on this\r\noccasion, did not know the distinguished traveller, and, after\r\nanswering Seward's many questions, attempted to discover the identity\r\nof his companion. The Governor disclaimed being a merchant, a\r\nlecturer, a minister, or a teacher. \"Then I know what you are,\" said\r\nthe driver; \"you must be a lawyer, or you wouldn't ask so many\r\nquestions.\" \"That is not my business at present,\" replied Seward.\r\n\"Then who are you?\" finally demanded Jehu. \"I am the governor of this\r\nState,\" replied Seward. The driver at once showed incredulity, and the\r\nGovernor offered to leave it to the landlord at the next tavern. On\r\narriving there, and after exchanging salutations, Seward suggested the\r\nquestion in dispute. \"No, you are not the governor,\" replied the\r\nlandlord, to the great satisfaction of the driver. \"What!\" exclaimed\r\nSeward, in astonishment; \"then who is governor?\" \"Why,\" said the\r\nlandlord, \"Thurlow Weed.\"[308]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n423.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: _Ibid._, Vol. 2, p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 642.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n100.]\r\n\r\n\"Though the incident never occurred,\" says Frederick W. Seward, in the\r\nbiography of his father, \"the story was so accordant with his habit of\r\nriding outside to smoke, and with the popular understanding of his\r\nrelations with Mr. Weed, that it was generally accepted as true.\r\nSeward himself used laughingly to relate it, and say that, though it\r\nwas not quite true, it ought to be.\"[309]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 395.]\r\n\r\nWith Governor Seward's inauguration the Whig party was placed on\r\ntrial. Ten years had passed since DeWitt Clinton's death, and Seward\r\nwas the first successor whose opinions and sentiments harmonised with\r\nthose of that distinguished statesman. During the intervening period\r\nthe Regency had been in absolute control of the State. It had\r\ncontented itself with looking after things as they existed, rather\r\nthan undertaking further improvements and reforms. Seward's election,\r\ntherefore, was not only a revolution of parties, but a radical change\r\nof policy. Every Whig, fearful lest some misstep might lead to the\r\nearly loss of the power just gained, had an opinion as to what should\r\nand should not be done. Some were afraid the Governor would say too\r\nmuch, others fearful he would say too little. Seward, moving on broad\r\nlines of economics and reform, believed that the promotion of\r\ntransportation, the development of capital and credit, and the\r\nenlargement of educational advantages, would bring wealth to the State\r\nand greater happiness to the people; and his first message contained\r\nthe policy that guided him throughout his entire political career. In\r\nits preparation, he relied upon President Knott of Union College for\r\nassistance on the subject of education; on John H. Beach for financial\r\nstatistics; on Samuel B. Ruggles for canal figures; and on John C.\r\nSpencer for general suggestions. Then he sat down with Weed for its\r\nfinal revision. When completed, it contained the groundwork of his\r\npolitical philosophy. He would prosecute the work of the canals, he\r\nwould encourage the completion of railroads, establish a board of\r\ninternal improvement, extend charitable institutions, improve the\r\ndiscipline of prisons, elevate the standard of education in schools\r\nand colleges, establish school district libraries, provide for the\r\neducation of the coloured race, reform the practice of courts, cut off\r\nsuperfluous offices, repeal the Small Bills law, authorise banking\r\nunder general laws, and apply rigorous safeguards, especially in\r\npopulous cities, for the purity of the ballot-box. In concluding, he\r\npaid a handsome tribute to DeWitt Clinton and recommended that a\r\nmonument be erected to his memory in Albany.\r\n\r\nNone of our statesmen, with whom reform has been a characteristic\r\ntrait, was more devoted or happy. His delight, deep and unfailing,\r\nextended to every department of the government, and the minuteness of\r\nhis knowledge betrayed the intimate acquaintance which he had gained\r\nof the affairs of the State during his four years in the Senate. His\r\nmessage caught the inspiration of this fresh and joyous maturity. It\r\nwas written, too, in the easy, graceful style, rhythmical and subdued\r\nin expression, which afterward contributed to his extreme charm as an\r\norator. From the first, Seward was an ardent optimist, and this first\r\nmessage is that of noble youth, delighting in the life and the\r\nopportunities that a great office presents to one who is mindful of\r\nits harassing duties and its relentless limitations, yet keenly\r\nsensitive to its novelty and its infinite incitements. The Democrats,\r\nwhose hearts must have rejoiced when they heard his message, declared\r\nit the visionary schemes of a theorising politician, the work of a\r\nsophomore rather than a statesman; yet, within little more than a\r\ndecade, most of his suggestions found a place in the statute book.\r\nThough the questions of that time are not the questions of our day,\r\nand engage only the historian and his readers, these twenty printed\r\npages of recommendations, certain to excite debate and opposition,\r\nmust always be read with deep enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe chief criticism of his opponents grew out of his acceptance of\r\nRuggles's estimate that the canals would more than reimburse the cost\r\nof their construction and enlargement. The _Argus_ asserted that\r\nSeward, instead of sustaining the policy of \"pay as you go,\" favoured\r\na \"forty million debt;\" and this became the great campaign cry of the\r\nDemocrats in two elections. On the other hand, the Whigs maintained\r\nthat the canals had enriched the people and the State, and that their\r\nfuture prosperity depended upon the enlargement of the Erie canal, so\r\nthat its capacity would meet the increasing demands of business. In\r\nthe end, the result showed how prophetically Seward wrote and how\r\nwisely Ruggles figured; for, although the Erie canal, in 1862, had\r\ncost $52,491,915.74, it had repaid the State with an excess of\r\n$42,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of so many recommendations, one wonders that Seward had\r\nnothing to say for civil service reform. We may doubt, and with\r\nreason, whether anything he might have said could have strengthened\r\nthe slight hold which such a theory then had in the minds of the\r\npeople, but it would have brought the need of reform strikingly before\r\nthe country to bear, in time, ripe fruit. The Whig party, however, was\r\nnot organised to keep Democrats in office, and no sooner had the\r\nAlbany _Journal_ announced Seward's election than applications began\r\npouring in upon the Governor-elect until more than one thousand had\r\nbeen filed. Seward afterward said that, of these applications, only\r\ntwo came from persons living west of Cayuga Bridge, although the\r\neighth district had given him a majority equal to his entire majority\r\nin the State.\r\n\r\nUnder the Constitution of 1821, there were more places to fill by\r\nappointment than under the Constitution of 1846, and twice as many as\r\nnow exist. In 1839, the Governor not only appointed port-wardens,\r\nharbour-masters, notaries public, and superintendents and\r\ncommissioners of various sorts, but he nominated judges, surrogates,\r\ncounty clerks, examiners of prisons, weighers of merchandise,\r\nmeasurers of grain, cullers of staves, and inspectors of flour,\r\nlumber, spirits, salt, beef and pork, hides and skins, and fish and\r\noil, besides numerous other officers. They applied formally to the\r\nGovernor and then went to Weed to get the place. Just so the Whig\r\nlegislators went through the form of holding a caucus to select state\r\nofficers after the slate had been made up. John C. Spencer became\r\nsecretary of state; Bates Cook of Niagara County, comptroller; Willis\r\nHall of New York City, attorney-general; Jacob Haight, treasurer; and\r\nOrville L. Holley, surveyor-general. Thurlow Weed's account, read\r\nwith the knowledge that he alone selected them, is decidedly\r\nhumourous. \"Bates Cook had but a local reputation,\" he says, \"and it\r\nrequired the strongest assurances from Governor Seward and myself that\r\nhe was abundantly qualified.\" In other words, it was necessary for the\r\ncaucus to know that Weed wanted him. \"The canvass for attorney-general\r\nwas very spirited,\" he continues, \"Joshua A. Spencer of Oneida and\r\nSamuel Stevens of Albany being the most prominent candidates;\" but\r\nWillis Hall, \"who was better known on the stump than at the bar, and\r\nwhose zeal, energy, and tact had been conspicuous and effective in\r\noverthrowing the Democratic party,\" got the office. Van Buren could\r\nnot have surpassed this for practical politics. \"The nomination of\r\nJacob Haight,\" he goes on, \"afforded me great satisfaction. I had\r\nlearned in my boyhood at Catskill to esteem and honour him. In 1824\r\nwhen, as a Democratic senator, he arrayed himself against William H.\r\nCrawford, the caucus nominee for President, and zealously supported\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, my early remembrances of him grew into a warm\r\npersonal friendship.\"[310] It was easy to fuse in Weed's big heart\r\nDemocratic apostacy and the associations of boyhood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 459.]\r\n\r\nYet Weed had able indorsers behind his candidates. \"I hear there is\r\ngreat opposition to Willis Hall,\" wrote William Kent, \"and I am sorry\r\nfor it. He has a great heart, and a great head, too. It has been his\r\nmisfortune, but our good fortune, that his time and talents have been\r\ndevoted to advancing the Whig party, while those who oppose him were\r\ntaxing costs and filing demurrers. The extreme Webster men in New York\r\nhave formed a combination against Willis. It is the dog in the manger,\r\ntoo, for no man from New York is a candidate.\"[311]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n73.]\r\n\r\nBut the dictator made a greater display of practical politics in the\r\nselection of a United States senator to succeed Nathaniel P.\r\nTallmadge. There were several aspirants, among them Millard Fillmore,\r\nJohn C. Spencer, John A. Collier, and Joshua A. Spencer. All these men\r\nwere intensely in earnest. Fillmore, then in Congress, was chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Ways and Means; and advancement to the Senate would\r\nhave been a deserved promotion. But Tallmadge had rallied to the\r\nsupport of Seward, under the name of Conservatives, many former\r\nNational Republicans, who had joined the Democratic party because of\r\nanti-Masonry, and Weed believed in keeping them in the Whig party by\r\nre-electing their leader. Fillmore, and other candidates, earnestly\r\nprotested against the policy of discarding tried and faithful friends,\r\nand of conferring the highest and most important place in the gift of\r\nthe party upon a new recruit whose fidelity could not be trusted;\r\n\"but, strong as those gentlemen were in the Whig party, they were\r\nunable to overcome a conviction in the minds of the Whig members of\r\nthe Legislature,\" says Weed, solemnly, as if the Whig members of the\r\nLegislature really did have something to do with it, \"that in view of\r\nthe approaching presidential election Mr. Tallmadge was entitled to\r\ntheir support. He was, therefore, nominated with considerable\r\nunanimity.\"[312] It was a great shock to Fillmore, which he resented a\r\nfew years later. Indeed, Weed's dictatorship, although quiet and\r\ngentle, was already raising dissent. Albert H. Tracy, indignant at\r\nSeward's nomination over the heads of older and more experienced men,\r\nhad withdrawn from politics, and Gamaliel H. Barstow, the first state\r\ntreasurer elected by the Whigs, resigned in a huff because he did not\r\nlike the way things were going. Weed fully realised the situation.\r\n\"There are a great many disappointed, disheartened friends,\" he wrote\r\nGranger. \"It has been a tremendous winter. But for the presidential\r\nquestion which will absorb all other things, the appointments would\r\ntear us to pieces.\"[313] To his door, Seward knew, the censure of the\r\ndisappointed would be aimed. \"The list of appointments made this\r\nwinter is fourteen hundred,\" he writes, \"and I am not surprised by\r\nany manifestation of disappointment or dissatisfaction. This only I\r\nclaim--that no interest, passion, prejudice or partiality of my own\r\nhas controlled any decision I have made.\"[314]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n461.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: _Ibid._, Vol. 2, p. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 483.]\r\n\r\nBut there was one wheel lacking in the Weed machine. The Democrats\r\ncontrolled the Senate, obstructing bills deemed by the Whigs essential\r\nto the public welfare, and refusing to confirm Seward's nominations.\r\nBy preventing an agreement upon a candidate, preliminary to a joint\r\nballot, they also blocked the election of a United States senator.\r\nThis situation was intolerable to Weed. Without the Senate, little\r\ncould be accomplished and nothing of a strictly partisan character.\r\nBesides, Weed had his eye on the lucrative place of state printer. In\r\nthe campaign of 1839, therefore, he set to work to win the higher body\r\nof the Legislature by carrying the Albany district, in which three\r\nsenators were to be chosen. For eighteen years, the Senate had been\r\nheld by the Regency party, and, in all that time, Albany was numbered\r\namong the reliable Democratic districts. But Weed's friends now\r\nbrought up eight thousand dollars from New York. The Democrats had\r\nmade a spirited fight, and, although they knew Weed was endowed with a\r\nfaculty for management, they did not know of his money, or of the\r\nability of his lieutenants to place it. When the votes were counted,\r\nWeed's three nominees had an average majority of one hundred and\r\nthirty-three. This gave the Whigs nineteen senators and the Democrats\r\nthirteen. It was an appalling change for the Democrats, to whom it\r\nseemed the prologue to a defeat in 1840. In the \"clean sweep\" of\r\noffice-holders that followed, Tallmadge went back to the United States\r\nSenate, and Weed took from Croswell the office of public printer.\r\n\r\nThe presidential election of 1840 began in December, 1839. During\r\nClay's visit to Saratoga, in the preceding summer, Weed had told him\r\nhe could not carry New York; but, that Clay's friends in New York\r\nCity, and along the river counties, might not be unduly alarmed, Weed\r\nmasked his purpose of forcing Harrison's nomination, by selecting\r\ndelegates ostensibly favourable to General Scott. Twenty delegates for\r\nScott were, therefore, sent to the national convention at Harrisburg,\r\ntwo for Harrison and ten for Clay. On his way, Weed secured an\r\nagreement from the New England leaders to act with him, and, by a\r\ncombination of the supporters of Scott and Harrison, the latter\r\nfinally received one hundred and forty-eight votes to ninety for Clay.\r\nThe disappointment of Clay's friends is historic. Probably nothing\r\nparallels it in American politics. The defeat of Seward at Chicago in\r\n1860, and of Elaine at Cincinnati in 1876, very seriously affected\r\ntheir friends, but the disappointment of Clay's supporters at\r\nHarrisburg, in December, 1839, took the form of anger, which, for a\r\ntime, seemed fatal to the ticket. \"The nomination of Harrison,\" wrote\r\nThurlow Weed, \"so offended the friends of Clay that the convention was\r\nthrown entirely in the dark on the question of Vice President. The\r\nKentucky delegation was asked to present a candidate, but they\r\ndeclined. Then John Clayton of Delaware was fixed upon, but Reverdy\r\nJohnson withdrew his name. Watkins Leigh of Virginia and Governor\r\nDudley of North Carolina were successively designated, but they\r\ndeclined. While this was passing the Vice Presidency was repeatedly\r\noffered to New York, but we had no candidate. Albert H. Tracy was\r\neminently qualified for usefulness in public life. He entertained a\r\nhigh and strict sense of official responsibility, and had he not\r\npreviously left us he would have been nominated. John Tyler was\r\nfinally taken because we could get nobody else to accept.\"[315]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n77.]\r\n\r\nThe Harrisburg convention, unlike its unselfish predecessors,\r\nadjourned without a platform or declaration of principles; nor did the\r\ncandidates, in accepting their nominations, indulge in political\r\ndiscussion. Votes were wanted from all who opposed Van Buren's\r\nadministration--from the strict constructionist friends of Tyler,\r\nalthough opposed to the whole Whig theory of government, as much as\r\nfrom the followers of Harrison, who believed in protective tariffs\r\nand internal improvements.\r\n\r\nSuch action contrasted strangely with the work of the national\r\nDemocratic convention which met at Baltimore on May 6, 1840. If\r\ndespondency filled the air, the delegates at least had the courage of\r\ntheir convictions. After unanimously renominating Van Buren, it\r\ndeclared for a limited federal power, for the separation of public\r\nmoneys from private banks, and for the constitutional inability of\r\nCongress to interfere with slavery in the States, pronouncing the\r\nefforts of Abolitionists both alarming and dangerous to the Union; it\r\nopposed internal improvements by the general government; the fostering\r\nof one industry to the injury of another; the raising of more money\r\nthan was needed for necessary expenses; and the rechartering of a\r\nnational bank. If this declaration did not shape the phrases, and\r\nmarshal the sentences of future platforms of the party, it embraced\r\nthe principles upon which Democracy went up to victory or down to\r\ndefeat during the next two decades; and it must have carried Van Buren\r\nthrough successfully had not his administration fallen upon evil\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe President, with great moral courage and keen-sighted wisdom, met\r\nthe crisis of 1837 with an admirable bearing. The statesman suddenly\r\ndisplaced the politician. In the three months intervening between the\r\nsuspension of specie payments and the extra session of Congress, Van\r\nBuren prepared a message as clear and as unanswerable as the logic of\r\nHamilton's state papers. The law, he said, required the secretary of\r\nthe treasury to deposit public moneys only in banks paying their notes\r\nin specie, and, since all banks had suspended specie payments, it was\r\nnecessary to provide some other custody. For this reason, he had\r\nsummoned Congress. Then he analysed the cause of the panic, arguing\r\nthat \"the government could not help people earn a living, but it could\r\nrefuse to aid the deception that paper is gold, and the delusion that\r\nvalue can arise without labour.\" Those who look to the action of the\r\ngovernment, he declared, for specific aid to the citizen to relieve\r\nembarrassments arising from losses by reverses in commerce and credit,\r\nlose sight of the ends for which government is created, and the powers\r\nwith which it is clothed. In conclusion, he recommended the enactment\r\nof an independent treasury scheme, divorcing the bank and the state.\r\n\r\nThese words of wisdom, often repeated, long ago became the principle\r\nof all administrations, notably of that of President Grant in the\r\ngreat crisis of 1873; and, except from 1841 to 1846, the sub-treasury\r\nscheme has been a cardinal feature of American finance. But its\r\nenactment was a long, fierce battle. Beginning in 1837, the contest\r\ncontinued through one Congress and half of another. Clay resisted and\r\nWebster denounced the project, which did not become a law until July\r\n4, 1840--too late to be of assistance to Van Buren in November.\r\nFriends of the New Yorker loved to dwell upon his courage in thus\r\nplacing himself in the chasm between failing banks and a patriotic\r\npeople, often paralleling it with the historic leap of Marcus Curtius\r\ninto the Roman Forum to save the republic. \"But with this difference,\"\r\nonce exclaimed Andrew B. Dickinson, an unlearned but brilliant Steuben\r\nCounty Whig, generally known as Bray Dickinson: \"the Roman feller\r\njumped into the gap of his own accord, but the people throw'd Van\r\nBuren in!\"\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 1840, the Whigs renominated William H. Seward for\r\ngovernor, and in the following month the Democrats named William C.\r\nBouck. There was a rugged honesty and ability about Bouck that\r\ncommended him to the people. He was not brilliant; he rarely attempted\r\nto speak in public; and his education had been limited to a few months\r\nof school in each winter; but he was a shrewd, wise Schoharie farmer,\r\nwell read in the ways of men and in the book of the world. Seward\r\nthought him \"a kind, honest, amiable, and sagacious man, his easy and\r\nfascinating manners lacking neither dignity nor grace.\" Beginning as\r\ntown clerk, Bouck had served acceptably as sheriff, assemblyman, and\r\nfor nineteen years as canal commissioner, personally superintending\r\nthe construction of the canal from Brockport to Lake Erie, and\r\ndisbursing, without loss, eight millions of dollars. He had travelled\r\nup and down the State until the people came to know him as \"the old\r\nwhite horse,\" in allusion to a favourite animal which he rode for many\r\nyears; and to labourers and contractors his election became a matter\r\nof the greatest personal interest.\r\n\r\nBut the hardships growing out of the panic of 1837 and the crisis of\r\n1839 guided the actions of men. It made little difference to them that\r\nBouck had been a faithful, prudent, and zealous supporter of the\r\ncanals, or that, like DeWitt Clinton, he had been removed as canal\r\ncommissioner on purely political grounds. The issues were\r\nnational--not state. Van Buren clearly saw the force and direction of\r\npublic sentiment. Yet his sub-treasury measure, so beneficent in its\r\naims that its theory was not lost in the necessities growing out of\r\nthe Civil War, proved the strongest weapon in the armory of his\r\nopponents. Webster, with mingled pathos and indignation, denounced his\r\n\"disregard for the public distress\" by his \"exclusive concern for the\r\ninterest of government and revenue,\" declaring that help must come to\r\nthe people \"from the government of the United States--from thence\r\nalone!\" This was the cry of the greenbacker in 1876 and the argument\r\nof the free silver advocate in 1896. \"Upon this,\" said Webster, \"I\r\nrisk my political reputation, my honour, my all. He who expects to\r\nlive to see these twenty-six States resuming specie payments in\r\nregular succession once more, may expect to see the restoration of the\r\nJews. Never. He will die without the sight.\" Yet Webster lived to see\r\nthe resumption of specie payments in a very short time, and he lived\r\nlong enough also to exclude this St. Louis speech from his collected\r\nworks. Nevertheless, Webster's eloquence contributed to Van Buren's\r\noverwhelming defeat.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written of the historic campaign of 1840. The enthusiasm\r\nhas been called \"frenzy\" and \"crazy fanatacism.\" It has also been\r\nlikened to the crusading spirit, aroused by the preaching of Peter the\r\nHermit. \"The nation,\" said Clay, \"was like the ocean when convulsed by\r\nsome terrible storm.\" Webster declared that \"every breeze says\r\nchange; the cry, the universal cry, is for a change.\" Long before\r\ncampaigns usually begin New York was a blaze of excitement. Halls were\r\ninsufficient to hold the crowds. Where hundreds had formerly\r\nassembled, thousands now appeared. The long lines of wagons, driven to\r\nthe meeting places, raised clouds of dust such as mark the moving of\r\narmies. The Whig state convention at Utica became a mass-meeting of\r\ntwenty-five thousand people, who formed into one great parade. \"How\r\nlong is this procession?\" asked a bystander of one of the marshals.\r\n\"Indeed, sir, I cannot tell,\" was the reply. \"The other end of it is\r\nforming somewhere near Albany.\"\r\n\r\nThe canvass became one of song, of association, and of imagination,\r\nwhich aroused thoughts that were intensely animating and absorbing.\r\nThe taunt of a Virginia newspaper that Harrison should remain in his\r\nlog cabin on the banks of the Ohio made the log cabin \"a symbol,\" as\r\nWeed happily expressed it, \"of virtue that dwells in obscurity, of the\r\nhopes of the humble, of the privations of the poor, of toil and\r\ndanger, of hospitality and charity and frugality.\" Log cabins sprang\r\nup like gourds in a night. At the door, stood the cider barrel, and,\r\nhanging by the window, the omnipresent coonskin swayed in the breeze.\r\nThey appeared on medals, in pictures, in fancy work, and in\r\nprocessions. Horace Greeley, who had done so much in 1838 through the\r\ncolumns of the _Jeffersonian_, now began the publication of the _Log\r\nCabin_, filling whole sides of it with songs elaborately set to music,\r\nand making it so universally popular that the New York _Tribune_,\r\nestablished in the following year, became its legitimate successor in\r\nability and in circulation.\r\n\r\nIn his biography of Henry Clay, Schurz says that in no presidential\r\ncanvass has there ever been \"less thought.\" It is likely if there had\r\nbeen no log cabins, no cider, no coon-skins, and no songs, the result\r\nwould have been the same, for, in the presence of great financial\r\ndistress, the people seek relief very much as they empty a burning\r\nbuilding. But the reader of the _Log Cabin_ will find thought enough.\r\nGreeley's editorials summed up the long line of mistakes leading to\r\nthe panic of 1837, and the people understood the situation. They were\r\nsimply unwilling longer to trust the party in power.\r\n\r\nEvidence of this distrust astonished Democrats as much as it pleased\r\nthe Whigs. The September election in Maine, followed in October by the\r\nresult in Ohio and Indiana, both of which gave large Whig majorities,\r\nanticipated Harrison's overwhelming election in November. In New York,\r\nhowever, the returns were somewhat disappointing to the Whigs.\r\nHarrison carried the State by thirteen thousand majority, receiving in\r\nall 234 electoral votes to 60 for Van Buren; but Seward's majority of\r\nten thousand in 1838 now dropped to five thousand,[316] while the Whig\r\nmajority in the Assembly was reduced to four.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: William H. Seward, 222,011; William C. Bouck,\r\n216,808.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nSeward's weakness undoubtedly grew out of his message in the preceding\r\nJanuary. With the approval of Dr. Knott of Union College, and Dr.\r\nLuckey, a distinguished Methodist divine, he recommended the\r\nestablishment of separate schools for the children of foreigners and\r\ntheir instruction by teachers of the same faith and language. The\r\nsuggestion created an unexpected and bitter controversy. Influential\r\njournals of both parties professed to see in it only a desire to win\r\nCatholic favour, charging that Bishop Hughes of New York City had\r\ninspired the recommendation. At that time, the Governor had neither\r\nmet nor been in communication, with the Catholic prelate; but, in the\r\nexcitement, truth could not outrun misstatement, nor could the\r\npatriotism that made Seward solicitous to extend school advantages to\r\nthe children of foreign parents, who were growing up in ignorance, be\r\nunderstood by zealous churchmen.\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat, Van Buren retired to Lindenwald, in the vicinity of\r\nKinderhook, his native village, where he was to live twenty-one years,\r\ndying at the age of eighty. Lindenwald was an old estate, whose acres\r\nhad been cultivated for one hundred and sixty years. William P. Van\r\nNess, the distinguished jurist and orator, once owned it, and, thirty\r\nyears before the ex-President bought it, Irving had secluded himself\r\namidst its hills, while he mourned the death of his betrothed, and\r\nfinished the _Knickerbocker_. As the home of Van Buren, Lindenwald did\r\nnot, perhaps, become a Monticello or a Montpelier. Jefferson and\r\nMadison, having served eight years, the allotted term of honour, had\r\nformally retired, and upon them settled the halo of peace and triumph\r\nthat belongs to the sage; but life at Lindenwald, with its leisure,\r\nits rural quiet, and its freedom from public care, satisfied Van\r\nBuren's bucolic tastes, and no doubt greatly mitigated the anguish\r\narising from bitter defeat, the proscription of friends, and the loss\r\nof party regard which he was destined to suffer during the next\r\ndecade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHUMILIATION OF THE WHIGS\r\n\r\n1841-1842\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Whig state convention, assembled at Syracuse on October 7, 1842,\r\nlooked like the ghost of its predecessor in 1840. The buoyancy which\r\nthen stamped victory on every face had given place to fear and\r\nforebodings. Eighteen months had left nothing save melancholy\r\nrecollections. Even the log cabins, still in place, seemed to add to\r\nWhig depression, being silent reminders of the days when melody and\r\noratory, prophetic of success, filled hearts which could no longer be\r\ntouched with hope and faith. This meant that the Whigs, in the\r\nelection of 1841, had suffered a decisive defeat, losing the Assembly,\r\nthe Senate, and most of the congressmen. Even Francis Granger, whose\r\nmajority usually ran into the thousands, was barely elected by five\r\nhundred. Orleans County, at one time the centre of the anti-masonic\r\ncrusade, sent Sanford E. Church to Albany, the first Democrat to break\r\ninto the Assembly from the \"infected district\" since the abduction of\r\nWilliam Morgan.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons accounted for this change. Harrison's death, within a\r\nmonth after his inauguration, made John Tyler President, and Tyler\r\nfirst refused appointments to Whigs, and then vetoed the bill, passed\r\nby a Whig Congress, re-establishing the United States Bank. He said\r\nthat he had been opposed, for twenty-five years, to the exercise of\r\nsuch a power, if any such power existed under the Constitution. This\r\ncompleted the break with the party that elected him. Henry Clay\r\ndenounced his action, the Cabinet, except Webster, resigned in a body,\r\nand the Whigs with great unanimity indorsed the Kentucky statesman for\r\nPresident in 1844. To add to the complications in New York, John C.\r\nSpencer, who now became secretary of war, so zealously espoused and\r\nwarmly defended the President that feelings of mutual distrust and\r\nill-will soon grew up between him and Weed. It is doubtful if any New\r\nYork Whig, at a time of such humiliation, could have accepted place in\r\nTyler's Cabinet and remained on terms of political intimacy with Weed;\r\nbut, of all men, John C. Spencer was the least likely to do so. In\r\nFreeman's celebrated cartoon, \"The Whig Drill,\" Spencer is the only\r\nman in the squad out of step with Thurlow Weed, the drum-major.\r\n\r\nGovernor Seward also played a part in the story of his party's\r\ndownfall. The school question, growing out of his recommendation that\r\nseparate schools for the children of Roman Catholics should share in\r\nthe public moneys appropriated by the State for school purposes, lost\r\nnone of its bitterness; the McLeod controversy put him at odds with\r\nthe national Administration; and the Virginia controversy involved him\r\nin a correspondence that made him odious in the South. In his\r\ntreatment of the McLeod matter, Seward was clearly right. Three years\r\nafter the destruction of the _Caroline_, which occurred during the\r\nCanadian rebellion, Alexander McLeod, while upon a visit in the State,\r\nboasted that he was a member of the attacking party and had killed the\r\nonly man shot in the encounter. This led to his arrest on a charge of\r\nmurder and arson. The British Minister based his demand for McLeod's\r\nrelease on the ground that the destruction of the _Caroline_ \"was a\r\npublic act of persons in Her Majesty's service, obeying the orders of\r\ntheir superior authorities.\" In approving the demand, Lord Palmerston\r\nsuggested that McLeod's execution \"would produce war, war immediate\r\nand frightful in its character, because it would be a war of\r\nretaliation and vengeance.\" Webster, then secretary of state, urged\r\nSeward to discontinue the prosecution and discharge McLeod; but the\r\nGovernor, promising a pardon if McLeod was convicted, insisted that he\r\nhad no power to interfere with the case until after trial, while the\r\ncourts, upon an application for McLeod's discharge on habeas corpus,\r\nheld that as peace existed between Great Britain and the United States\r\nat the time of the burning of the _Caroline_, and as McLeod held no\r\ncommission and acted without authority, England's assumption of\r\nresponsibility for his act after his arrest did not oust the court of\r\nits jurisdiction. Fortunately, McLeod, proving his boast a lie by\r\nshowing that he took no part in the capture of the _Caroline_, put an\r\nend to the controversy, but Seward's refusal to intervene broke\r\nwhatever relations had existed between himself and Webster.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia correspondence created even greater bitterness. The\r\nGovernor discovered that a requisition for the surrender of three\r\ncoloured men, charged with aiding the escape of a fugitive slave, was\r\nbased upon a defective affidavit; but, before he could act, the court\r\ndischarged the prisoners upon evidence that no offence had been\r\ncommitted against the laws of Virginia. Here the matter might very\r\nproperly have ended; but, in advising Virginia's governor of their\r\ndischarge, Seward voluntarily and with questionable propriety,\r\nenlarged upon an interpretation of the constitutional provision for\r\nthe surrender of fugitives from justice, contending that it applied to\r\nacts made criminal by the laws of both States, and not to \"an act\r\ninspired by the spirit of humanity and of the Christian religion,\"\r\nwhich was not penal in New York. This was undoubtedly as good law as\r\nit was poor politics, for it needlessly aroused the indignation of\r\nVirginia, whose legislature retaliated by imposing special burdens\r\nupon vessels trading between Virginia and New York until such time as\r\nthe latter should repeal the statute giving fugitive slaves the right\r\nof trial by jury.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the Whig defeat, however, had its origin in\r\ndisasters incident to the construction of the canals. It had been the\r\npolicy of Governor Marcy, and other Democratic leaders, to confine the\r\nannual canal expenditures to the surplus revenues, and, in enlarging\r\nthe Erie, it was determined to continue this policy. On the other\r\nhand, the Whigs advocated a speedy completion of the public works,\r\nlimiting the state debt to an amount upon which interest could be paid\r\nout of the surplus revenues derived from the canal. This policy,\r\nbacked by several Democratic members of the Senate in 1838, resulted\r\nin the authorisation of a loan of four millions for the Erie\r\nenlargement. In 1839 Seward, still confident of the State's ability to\r\nsustain the necessary debt, advised other improvements, including the\r\ncompletion of the Genesee Valley and Black River canals, as well as\r\nthe construction of three railroads, at a total estimated expenditure\r\nof twelve to fifteen millions. By 1841, the debt had increased to\r\neighteen millions, including the loan of four millions, while the work\r\nwas scarcely half finished. To add to the difficulty, state stocks\r\ndepreciated over twenty per cent., embarrassing the administration in\r\nits efforts to raise money. The Democrats pronounced such a policy\r\ndisastrous and ruinous; and, although the Whigs replied that the\r\noriginal estimates were wrong, that the price of labour and material\r\nhad advanced, and that when completed the canals would speedily pay\r\nfor themselves, the people thought it time to call a halt, and in the\r\nelection of 1841 they called it.[317]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: \"Seward had faults, which his accession to power soon\r\ndisplayed in bold relief. His natural tendencies were toward a\r\ngovernment not merely paternal, but prodigal--one which, in its\r\nmultiform endeavours to make every one prosperous, if not rich, was\r\nvery likely to whelm all in general embarrassment, if not in general\r\nbankruptcy. Few governors have favoured, few senators voted for more\r\nunwisely lavish expenditures than he. Above the suspicion of voting\r\nmoney into his own pocket, he has a rooted dislike to opposing a\r\nproject or bill whereby any of his attached friends are to profit.\r\nAnd, conceited as we all are, I think most men exceed him in the art\r\nof concealing from others their overweening faith in their own\r\nsagacity and discernment.\"--Horace Greeley, _Recollections of a Busy\r\nLife_, p. 312.]\r\n\r\nIt was this overwhelming defeat that so depressed the Whigs, gathered\r\nat the Syracuse convention, as they looked over the field for a\r\ngubernatorial candidate to lead them, if possible, out of the\r\nwilderness of humiliation. Seward had declined a renomination. He knew\r\nthat his course, especially in the Virginia controversy, had aroused\r\na feeling of hostility among certain Whigs who not only resented his\r\nadvancement over Granger and Fillmore, his seniors in years and in\r\nlength of public service, but who dreaded his lead as too bold, too\r\nearnest, and too impulsive. The fact that the Abolitionists had\r\nalready invited him to accept their nomination for President in 1844\r\nindicated the extent to which his Virginia correspondence had carried\r\nhim. So, he let his determination be known. \"My principles are too\r\nliberal, too philanthropic, if it be not vain to say so, for my\r\nparty,\" he wrote Christopher Morgan, then a leading member of\r\nCongress. \"The promulgation of them offends many; the operation of\r\nthem injures many; and their sincerity is questioned by about all.\r\nThose principles, therefore, do not receive fair consideration and\r\ncandid judgment. There are some who know them to be right, and believe\r\nthem to be sincere. These would sustain me. Others whose prejudices\r\nare aroused against them, or whose interests are in danger, would\r\ncombine against me. I must, therefore, divide my party in convention.\r\nThis would be unfortunate for them, and, of all others, the most false\r\nposition for me. And what have I to lose by withdrawing and leaving\r\nthe party unembarrassed? My principles are very good and popular ones\r\nfor a man out of office; they will take care of me, when out of\r\noffice, as they always have done. I have had enough, Heaven knows, of\r\nthe power and pomp of place.\"[318]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 547.]\r\n\r\nWith Seward out of the way, Luther Bradish was the logical candidate\r\nfor governor. Fillmore had many friends present, and John A. Collier\r\nof Binghamton, alternating between hope and fear, let his wishes be\r\nknown. But, as lieutenant-governor, Bradish had won popularity by\r\nfirmness, patience, and that tact which springs from right feeling,\r\nrather than cold courtesy; and, in the end, the vote proved him the\r\nfavourite. For lieutenant-governor, the convention chose Gabriel\r\nFurman, a Brooklyn lawyer of great natural ability, who had been a\r\njudge of the municipal court and was just then closing a term in the\r\nState Senate, but whose promising career was already marred by the\r\nopium habit. He is best remembered as one of Brooklyn's most valued\r\nlocal historians. The resolutions, adhering to the former Whig policy,\r\ncondemning Tyler's vetoes and indicating a preference for Clay, showed\r\nthat the party, although stripped of its enthusiastic hopes, had lost\r\nnone of its faith in its principles or confidence in its great\r\nstandard-bearer.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats had divided on canal improvements. Beginning in the\r\nadministration of Governor Throop, one faction, known as the\r\nConservatives, had voted with the Whigs in 1838, while the other,\r\ncalled Radicals, opposed the construction of any works that would\r\nincrease the debt. This division reasserted itself in the Legislature\r\nwhich convened in January, 1842. The Radicals elected all the state\r\nofficers. Azariah C. Flagg became comptroller, Samuel Young secretary\r\nof state, and George P. Barker attorney-general. Six canal\r\ncommissioners, belonging to the same wing of the party, were also\r\nselected. Behind them, as a leader of great force in the Assembly,\r\nstood Michael Hoffman of Herkimer, ready to rain fierce blows upon the\r\npolicy of Seward and the Conservatives. Hoffman had served eight years\r\nin Congress, and three years as a canal commissioner. He was now, at\r\nfifty-four years of age, serving his first term in the Assembly,\r\nbringing to the work a great reputation both for talents and\r\nintegrity, and as a powerful and effective debater.[319] Hoffman was\r\neducated for a physician, but afterward turned to the law. \"Had he not\r\nbeen drawn into public life,\" says Thurlow Weed, \"he would have been\r\nas eminent a lawyer as he became a statesman.\"[320]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: \"For four days the debate on a bill for the enlargement\r\nof the canals shed darkness rather than light over the subject, and\r\nthe chamber grew murky. One morning a tallish man, past middle age,\r\nwith iron-gray locks drooping on his shoulders, and wearing a mixed\r\nsuit of plain clothes, took the floor. I noticed that pens,\r\nnewspapers, and all else were laid down, and every eye fixed on the\r\nspeaker. I supposed he was some quaint old joker from the backwoods,\r\nwho was going to afford the House a little fun. The first sentences\r\narrested my attention. A beam of light shot through the darkness, and\r\nI began to get glimpses of the question at issue. Soon a broad belt of\r\nsunshine spread over the chamber. 'Who is he?' I asked a member.\r\n'Michael Hoffman,' was the reply. He spoke for an hour, and though his\r\nmanner was quiet and his diction simple, he was so methodical and\r\nlucid in his argument that, where all had appeared confused before,\r\neverything now seemed clear.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_,\r\np. 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n34.]\r\n\r\nThe Albany Regency, as a harmonious, directing body, had, by this\r\ntime, practically gone out of existence. Talcott was dead, Marcy and\r\nSilas Wright were in Washington, Benjamin F. Butler, having resigned\r\nfrom the Cabinet as attorney-general, in 1838, had resumed the\r\npractice of his profession in New York City, and Van Buren, waiting\r\nfor another term of the Presidency, rested at Lindenwald. The\r\nremaining members of the original Regency, active as ever in political\r\naffairs, were now destined to head the two factions--Edwin Croswell,\r\nstill editor of the Albany _Argus_, leading the Conservatives, with\r\nDaniel S. Dickinson, William C. Bouck, Samuel Beardsley, Henry A.\r\nFoster, and Horatio Seymour. Azariah C. Flagg, with Samuel Young,\r\nGeorge P. Barker, and Michael Hoffman, directed the Radicals. All were\r\nable men. Bouck carried fewer guns than Young; Beardsley had weight\r\nand character, without much aptitude; Foster overflowed with knowledge\r\nand was really an able man, but his domineering nature and violent\r\ntemper reduced his influence. Seymour, now only thirty-two years old,\r\nhad not yet entered upon his illustrious and valuable public career;\r\nnor had Daniel S. Dickinson, although of acknowledged ability,\r\nexhibited those traits which were to distinguish him in party\r\nquarrels. He did not belong in the class with Marcy and Wright, though\r\nfew New Yorkers showed more indomitable courage than Dickinson--a\r\ncharacteristic that greatly strengthened his influence in the councils\r\nof the leaders whose differences were already marked with asperity.\r\n\r\nSuccess is wont to have magical effects in producing a wish to put an\r\nend to difference; and the legislative winter of 1843 became notable\r\nfor the apparent adjustment of Democratic divisions. The Radicals\r\nproposed the passage of an act, known as the \"stop and tax law of\r\n1842,\" suspending the completion of the public works, imposing a\r\ndirect tax, and pledging a portion of the canal revenues as a sinking\r\nfund for the payment of the existing debt. It was a drastic measure,\r\nand leading Conservatives, with much vigour, sought to obtain a\r\ncompromise permitting the gradual completion of the most advanced\r\nworks. Bouck favoured sending an agent to Holland to negotiate a loan\r\nfor this purpose, a suggestion pressed with some ardour until further\r\neffort threatened to jeopardise his chance of a renomination for\r\ngovernor; and when Bouck ceased his opposition other Conservatives\r\nfell into line. The measure, thus unobstructed, finally became the\r\nlaw, sending the Democrats into the gubernatorial campaign of 1842\r\nwith high hopes of success.\r\n\r\nBy accident or design, the Democratic state convention also met at\r\nSyracuse on October 7. William C. Bouck and Daniel S. Dickinson had\r\nbeen the candidates, in 1840, for governor and lieutenant-governor,\r\nand they now demanded renomination. The Radicals wanted Samuel Young\r\nor Michael Hoffman for governor; and, before the passage of the \"stop\r\nand tax law,\" the contest bid fair to be a warm one. But, after making\r\nan agreement to pledge the party to the work of the last Legislature,\r\nthe Radicals withdrew all opposition to Bouck and Dickinson. In their\r\nresolutions, the Democrats applauded Tyler's vetoes; approved the\r\npolicy of his administration; denounced the re-establishment of a\r\nnational bank; opposed a protective tariff; and favoured the\r\nsub-treasury, hard money, a strict construction of the Constitution,\r\nand direct taxation for public works.\r\n\r\nThe campaign that followed stirred no enthusiasm on either side. The\r\nWhigs felt the weight of the canal debt, which rested heavily upon the\r\npeople; and, although many enthusiastic young men, active in the\r\norganisation of Clay clubs and in preparing the way for the Kentucky\r\nstatesman in 1844, held mass-meetings and read letters from their\r\ngreat leader, New York again passed under the control of the Democrats\r\nby a majority of nearly twenty-two thousand.[321] It was not an\r\nordinary defeat; it was an avalanche. Only one Whig senator, thirty\r\nWhig assemblymen, and nine or ten congressmen were saved in the wreck.\r\n\"I fear the party must break up from its very foundations,\" Fillmore\r\nwrote Weed. \"There is no cohesive principle--no common head.\"[322]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: William C. Bouck, 208,072; Luther Bradish,\r\n186,091.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n96.]\r\n\r\nSeward took no such pessimistic view. He had the promise of the future\r\nin him, a capacity for action, a ready sympathy with men of all\r\nclasses, occupations, and interests, and he saw rays of light where\r\nothers looked only into darkness. \"It is not a bad thing to be left\r\nout of Congress,\" he wrote Christopher Morgan, depressed by his\r\ndefeat. \"You will soon be wanted in the State, and that is a better\r\nfield.\"[323] Seward had the faculty of slow, reflective brooding, and\r\nhe often saw both deep and far. In the night of that blinding defeat\r\nonly such a nature could find comfort in the outlook.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 627.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDEMOCRATS DIVIDE INTO FACTIONS\r\n\r\n1842-1844\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of William C. Bouck's inauguration as governor, in\r\nJanuary, 1843, Democratic harmony disappeared. It was supposed the\r\nquestion of canal improvement had been settled by the \"stop and tax\r\nlaw\" of 1842, and by the subsequent agreement of the Conservatives, at\r\nthe Syracuse convention, in the following October. No one believed\r\nthat any serious disposition existed on the part of the Governor to\r\nopen the wound, since he knew a large majority of his party opposed\r\nthe resumption of the work, and that the state officers, who had\r\nviewed his nomination with coldness, were watching his acts and\r\ncritically weighing his words.\r\n\r\nBut he also knew that his most zealous and devoted friends, living\r\nalong the line of the Erie, Black River, and Genesee Valley canals,\r\nearnestly desired the speedy completion of certain parts of these\r\nwaterways. In order to please them, his message suggested the\r\npropriety of taking advantage of the low prices of labour and\r\nprovisions to finish some of the work. He did it timidly. There was no\r\npositive recommendation. He touched the subject as one handles a live\r\nelectric wire, trembling lest he rouse the sleeping opposition of the\r\nRadicals, or fail to meet the expectation of friends. But the\r\nrecommendation, too expressionless to cheer his friends and too\r\nenergetic to suit his opponents, foreshadowed the pitfalls into which\r\nhe was to tumble. He had been the first to suggest the Erie\r\nenlargement, and he knew better than any other man in the State how\r\nimportant was its completion; yet he said as little in its favour as\r\ncould be said, if he said anything at all, and that little seemed to\r\nbe prompted, not so much for the good of the State, as to satisfy the\r\ndemands of ardent friends, who had contributed to his nomination and\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nSevere criticism of the message, by the radical press, quickly showed\r\nthat not even a temporary reconciliation had been effected by the act\r\nof 1842. Had the Governor now been sufficiently endowed with a faculty\r\nfor good management, he must have strengthened himself and weakened\r\nhis enemies with the vast amount of patronage at his command. Not\r\nsince the days of Governor Lewis, had the making of so many\r\nappointments been committed to an executive. The Whigs, under Seward,\r\nhad taken every office in the State. But Bouck, practising the\r\nnepotism that characterised Lewis' administration forty years before,\r\ntook good care of his own family, and then, in the interest of\r\nharmony, turned whatever was left over to the members of the\r\nLegislature, who selected their own friends regardless of their\r\nrelations to the Governor. There is something grim and pathetic in the\r\npicture of the rude awakening of this farmer governor, who, while\r\nworking in his own weak way for harmony and conciliation, discovered,\r\ntoo late, that partisan rivalries and personal ambition had surrounded\r\nhim with a cordon of enemies that could not be broken. To add to his\r\nhumiliation, it frequently happened that the nominations of those whom\r\nhe greatly desired confirmed, were rejected in the Senate by the\r\nunited votes of Radicals and Whigs.\r\n\r\nThe controversy growing out of the election of a state printer to\r\nsucceed Thurlow Weed increased the bitterness between the factions.\r\nEdwin Croswell had been removed from this office in 1840, and the\r\nConservatives now proposed to reinstate him. Croswell had carefully\r\navoided taking part in the factional contests then beginning to rend\r\nthe party. He had supported, apparently in good faith, the \"stop and\r\ntax law\" of 1842, and, in the campaigns of 1841 and 1842, had been\r\nassociated with Azariah C. Flagg in the publication of the _Rough\r\nHewer_, a weekly paper of radical views, issued from the press of the\r\n_Argus_; but his sympathies were with the Conservatives, and when\r\nthey sought to re-elect him public printer, the Radicals, led by\r\nFlagg, announced as their candidate Henry H. Van Dyck, the owner,\r\nsince 1840, of a one-third interest in the _Argus_. For seventeen\r\nyears, from 1823 to 1840, Croswell had held the office of state\r\nprinter, accumulating wealth and enjoying the regard of the party; and\r\nFlagg and his colleagues contended that he should now give way to\r\nanother equally deserving. This was a strong reason in a party that\r\nbelieved in rotation in office, especially when coupled with a desire\r\non the part of the Radicals to control the _Argus_; and, to avoid an\r\nopen rupture, Croswell proposed that a law be passed making the\r\n_Argus_ the state paper, without naming a public printer. Van Dyck\r\nobjected to this, as it would leave Croswell in control of the\r\nestablishment. Besides, Van Dyck claimed that, at the time he\r\npurchased an interest in the _Argus_, Croswell promised to support him\r\nfor state printer. This Croswell denied.\r\n\r\nInstantly, the air was alive with the thrill of battle. Croswell faced\r\ndifficulties such as no other office-seeker had thus far encountered,\r\ndifficulties of faction, difficulties of public sentiment, and\r\ndifficulties of personnel. Flagg's conceded fidelity and honesty as a\r\npublic officer, supplemented by his shrewdness and sagacity, made him\r\nthe unquestioned leader of the Radicals; and, in this initial and\r\ncrucial test of strength, he was indisposed to compromise or\r\nconciliate; but in Edwin Croswell he met the most impressive figure\r\namong the gladiators of the party. Croswell was the veteran editor\r\nwhose judgment had guided its tactics, and whose words were instinct\r\nwith life, with prophecy, and with fate. When he entered the\r\npilot-house of his party, men knew something was going to happen. A\r\nperceptible hush seemed to announce his presence. At such times, his\r\ncaustic sentences, clear and compact, were rarely conciliatory; but\r\nwhen he turned away from the wheel, achievement had proven his right\r\nto leadership.\r\n\r\nIn his contest with Flagg, however, Croswell encountered angry\r\ncriticism from the Radicals and frigid approval from some\r\nConservatives. His candidacy plainly impaired the high respect which\r\nhis conduct and abilities had brought him. It was a mistake from every\r\npoint of view; but, once committed to such a course his Conservative\r\nfriends persevered, giving him finally sixty-six out of one hundred\r\nand six votes cast. A speech made by Assemblyman Leland of Steuben\r\naffords an interesting glimpse of the many influences summoned from\r\nevery quarter, until men found themselves in the centre of a political\r\ncauldron from which there seemed no escape. \"All who have come up here\r\nfor office,\" said Leland, \"have been compelled to take one side or the\r\nother, and as neither side knows what will be the result, some have\r\nbeen disposed to cry 'good Lord, if a Lord, or good devil, if not a\r\nLord.'\" The newspapers added to the perils of the quarrel. In the\r\ndiscussion preceding the election, the Albany _Atlas_, a daily paper\r\nrecently established, but until now without political prominence,\r\nbecame the organ of the Radicals; and between it and the _Argus_ a\r\nfierce editorial battle, which extended to other Democratic papers\r\nthroughout the State, made the factional division broader and more\r\nbitter.\r\n\r\nDespite their quarrels, which continued throughout the legislative\r\nsession, the Democrats, in the state election of November, 1843,\r\ncarried two-thirds of the Assembly and five-sixths of the Senate.\r\nNevertheless, the strength of the Conservatives was greatly increased.\r\nThe utter and sudden abandonment of the canals, marked by a long line\r\nof tools left where the workmen dropped them, had played an important\r\npart in the campaign, and when the Democratic legislative caucus\r\nconvened, in January, 1844, the friends of canal improvement easily\r\ndefeated Michael Hoffman for speaker by a vote of fifty-six to\r\nthirty-five, in favour of Elisha Litchfield of Onondaga. Henry A.\r\nFoster, also an uncompromising champion of the Conservatives, was\r\nelected president _pro tem._ of the Senate. Litchfield had been in\r\nCongress. He was a strong man of acknowledged influence in the central\r\ncounties of the State. Besides, he had been a faithful follower and\r\nan ardent admirer of Croswell. There were those who thought Horatio\r\nSeymour ought to be speaker; and, for a time, it looked as if he might\r\nsecure the office. He was the real leader of the Conservatives, and he\r\nhad more friends than Litchfield. But Litchfield had Croswell.\r\n\r\nBacked by such a re-enforcement of Conservatives, Governor Bouck spoke\r\nof canal improvement with less timidity. He admitted the necessity of\r\nthe tax law of 1842, but suggested the completion of \"such new works\r\nas can be done with better economy than to sustain those designed to\r\nbe superseded\" and \"are exposed to great and permanent injury.\" There\r\nwas nothing forceful in this recommendation. He still kept the middle\r\nof the road, but his request practically amounted to the completion of\r\nsome of the new work. It meant the finishing of the Schoharie\r\naqueduct, improving the Jordan level, enlarging the locks of the Erie\r\ncanal, and going on with the construction of the Black River and\r\nGenesee Valley canals.\r\n\r\nThe Radicals, realising the seriousness of the situation, now rested\r\ntheir hopes upon an elaborate report by Robert Dennison, chairman of\r\nthe Senate canal committee. It was a telling blow. It attacked the\r\nestimated, as compared to the actual, cost of the canals, charging\r\nengineers with culpable ignorance or corrupt intention. The Chenango\r\ncanal, it said, was estimated to cost $1,000,000; it actually cost\r\n$2,417,000. The first estimate of the Black River canal called for an\r\nexpenditure of $437,000; after work was commenced, a recalculation\r\nmade it $2,431,000. It cost, finally, over $2,800,000. The Genesee\r\nValley canal presented even greater disparity, and more glaring\r\nignorance. The original estimate fixed the cost at $1,774,000.\r\nAfterward, the same engineer computed it at $4,900,000; and it cost\r\nover $5,500,000. The State would have made money, the report said, had\r\nit built macadamised roads, instead of canals, at a cost of $4,000 a\r\nmile, and paid teamsters two dollars a day for hauling all the produce\r\nthat the canals would transport when finished. In conclusion,\r\nDennison declared that work on the canals could not be resumed without\r\nlaying an additional direct tax. This statement touched the\r\npocket-books of the people; and, in the opinion of the Radicals,\r\nclosed the discussion, for no Democrat, confronting a presidential and\r\ngubernatorial election, would dare burden his party with another\r\ndirect canal tax.\r\n\r\nHoratio Seymour, chairman of the canal committee of the Assembly, now\r\nappeared with a report, covering seventy-one octavo pages, which\r\nilluminated the question even to the enlightenment of Michael Hoffman.\r\nIt was the first display of that mastery of legislative skill and\r\npower, which Seymour's shrewd discerning mind was so well calculated\r\nto acquire. The young Oneida statesman had been a favourite since his\r\nadvent in the Assembly in 1842. His handsome face, made more\r\nattractive by large, luminous eyes, and a kind, social nature,\r\npeculiarly fitted him for public life; and, back of his fascinating\r\nmanners, lay sound judgment and great familiarity with state affairs.\r\nLike Seward, he possessed, in this respect, an advantage over older\r\nmembers, and he was now to show something of the moral power which the\r\nAuburn Senator displayed when he displeased the short-sighted\r\npartisans who seemed to exist and to act only for the present.\r\n\r\nIn presenting his report Seymour was careful to sustain the pledges of\r\nthe act of 1842, and to condemn the pre-existing policy of creating\r\nadditional debts for the purpose of constructing new canals or\r\nenlarging the Erie. With gentle and cunning skill he commended Azariah\r\nC. Flagg's policy, adopted in 1835, of using only the surplus revenue\r\nof the canals for such purposes. \"The errors we have committed,\" said\r\nhis report, \"are not without their utility or profitable teaching. The\r\ncorruptions of extravagance and the bitter consequences of\r\nindebtedness, have produced their own correctives, and public opinion,\r\nadmonished by the past, has returned to its accustomed and healthful\r\nchannels, from which it will not be readily diverted. There is no\r\nportion of our citizens who desire to increase our state indebtedness,\r\nor to do aught to the detriment of our common interests, when they\r\nare shown the evils that inevitably follow in the train of borrowing\r\nlarge sums of money, to be repaid, perhaps, in periods of pecuniary\r\ndistress and embarrassment. Neither is it true, on the other hand,\r\nthat any considerable number of our citizens are opposed to the\r\nextension of our canals when it can be effected by the aid of surplus\r\nrevenues.\"[324]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 412.]\r\n\r\nThis last sentence was the keynote. Bouck had suggested the principle,\r\nand other Conservatives had vainly tried to enforce it, but it\r\nremained for Seymour to obtain for it a fair and candid hearing. With\r\ngreat clearness, he unfolded the condition of the public works and of\r\nthe public finances, and, with able reasoning, he showed that, out of\r\nthe canal revenues, all the pledges of the act of 1842 could be met,\r\nand out of the surplus revenues, all the pledges of the act of 1836\r\ncould be completed. At the conclusion, he introduced a bill providing\r\nfor the resumption of work along the lines set forth in the report.\r\n\r\nThe reports of Dennison and Seymour reduced the issue to its lowest\r\nterms. Dennison wanted the surplus revenues, if any, applied to the\r\npayment of the state debt; Seymour insisted upon their use for the\r\nenlargement of the Erie and the completion of the Black River and\r\nGenesee Valley canals. Both favoured a sinking fund, with which to\r\nextinguish the state debt, and both opposed the construction of any\r\nnew work which should add to that debt. But Dennison, with pessimistic\r\ndoggedness, denied that there would be sufficient surplus to produce\r\nthe desired result. Seymour, with much of the optimism of Seward,\r\ncherished the hope that rich tolls, growing larger as navigation grew\r\nbetter, would flow into the treasury, until all the canals would be\r\ncompleted and all the debts wiped out. The Radical was more than a\r\npessimist--he was a strict constructionist of the act of 1842. He\r\nheld that the Seymour bill was a palpable departure from the policy of\r\nthat act, and that other measures, soon to follow, would eventually\r\noverthrow such a policy. To all this Seymour replied in his report,\r\nthat \"just views of political economy are not to be disseminated by\r\nharsh denunciations, which create the suspicion that there is more of\r\nhostility to the interests of those assailed than an honest desire to\r\nprotect the treasury of the State.\"[325]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 412.]\r\n\r\nHoffman and Seymour set the tone to the debate in the Assembly. They\r\nwere, admittedly, the leaders of the two factions, and, although\r\nHoffman possessed remarkable powers of denunciation, which he used\r\nfreely against measures, his courtesy toward opponents was no less\r\nmarked than Seymour's.[326] Other Conservatives supported the measure\r\nwith ability. But it was Seymour's firmness of mind, suavity of\r\nmanner, unwearied patience, and incomparable temper, under a thousand\r\nprovocations, that made it possible to pass the bill, substantially as\r\nhe wrote it, by a vote of sixty-seven to thirty-eight. Even Michael\r\nHoffman refused to vote against it, although he did not vote for it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: \"One morning Hoffman rose to reply to Seymour, but on\r\nlearning that he was ill he refused to deliver his speech for two or\r\nthree days, till Seymour was able to be in his seat.\"--H.B. Stanton,\r\n_Random Recollections_, p. 175.]\r\n\r\nThe measure met fiercer opposition in the Senate. It had more acrid\r\nand irritable members than the Assembly, and its talkers had sharper\r\ntongues. In debate, Foster was the most formidable, but Albert\r\nLester's acerbity of temper fixed the tone of the discussion. Finally,\r\nwhen the vote was taken the Democrats broke evenly for and against the\r\nmeasure; but, as five Whigs supported it, the bill finally passed,\r\nseventeen to thirteen.\r\n\r\nIt was a great victory for Seymour, then only thirty-four years old.\r\nIndeed, the history of the session may be described as the passage of\r\na single measure by a single man whose success was based on supreme\r\nfaith in the Erie canal. Seymour flowingly portrayed its benefits,\r\nand, with prophetic eye, saw the deeply ladened boats transporting the\r\nproduce of prosperous farmers who had chosen homes in the West when\r\naccess was rendered so easy. What seemed to others to threaten\r\ndisaster to the State, appealed to him as a great highway of commerce\r\nthat would yield large revenues to the Commonwealth and abundantly\r\nbless its people. He predicted the building of villages and the\r\ndevelopment of diversified industries along its banks, and, in one of\r\nhis captivating sentences, he described the pleasure of travelling\r\nquickly by packets, viewing the scenery of the Mohawk Valley by day\r\nand sleeping comfortably in a cabin-berth at night. But he did not\r\nfavour building so rapidly as to burden the State with debt. This was\r\nthe mistake of the Seward administration, and the inevitable reaction\r\ngave the Radicals an argument for delay, and Dennison an opportunity\r\nfor a telling report. Seymour put his faith in the earning capacity of\r\nthe Erie canal. Forty years later, when he advocated the abolition of\r\ntolls, he found all his predictions more than verified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nVAN BUREN DEFEATED AT BALTIMORE\r\n\r\n1844\r\n\r\n\r\nThe canal contest and Horatio Seymour's success preceded many\r\nsurprises and disappointments which were to be disclosed in the\r\ncampaign of 1844. Never were the motions of the political pendulum\r\nmore agitated or more irregular. For three years, public sentiment had\r\ndesignated Henry Clay and Martin Van Buren as the accepted candidates\r\nof their respective parties for President; and, until the spring of\r\n1844, the confidence of the friends of the Kentucky statesman did not\r\nexceed the assurance of the followers of the ex-President. Indeed, the\r\nDemocratic party was known throughout the country as the \"Van Buren\r\nparty,\" and, although James Buchanan, John C. Calhoun, and Lewis Cass\r\nhad each been named as suitable persons for Chief Executive, the sage\r\nof Lindenwald was the party's recognised leader and prospective\r\ncandidate. His sub-treasury scheme, accepted as wise and salutary, was\r\nstill the cornerstone of the party, buttressed by a tariff for\r\nrevenue and opposition to a national bank.\r\n\r\nIn national affairs, the Democratic party in New York was still a\r\nunit. The Legislature of 1843 had re-elected Silas Wright to the\r\nUnited States Senate, without a dissenting Democratic vote; and a\r\nstate convention, held at Syracuse in September of the same year, and\r\nmade up of Radicals and Conservatives, had instructed its delegation\r\nto support New York's favourite son. But a troublesome problem\r\nsuddenly confronted Van Buren. President Tyler had secretly negotiated\r\na treaty of annexation with Texas, ostensibly because of the\r\ncontiguity and great value of its territory, in reality, because, as\r\nCalhoun, then secretary of state, showed in his correspondence with\r\nGreat Britain, Texas seemed indispensable to the preservation and\r\nperpetuation of slavery. Texas had paved the way for such a treaty by\r\nproviding, in its constitution, for the establishment of slavery, and\r\nby prohibiting the importation of slaves from any country other than\r\nthe United States. But for three months friends of the treaty in the\r\nUnited States Senate had vainly endeavoured to find a two-thirds\r\nmajority in favour of its ratification. Then, the exponents of\r\nslavery, having secretly brought to their support the enormous\r\nprestige of Andrew Jackson, prepared to nominate a successor to\r\nPresident Tyler who would favour the treaty.\r\n\r\nVan Buren had never failed the South while in the United States\r\nSenate. He had voted against sending abolition literature through the\r\nmails into States that prohibited its circulation; he had approved the\r\nrules of the Senate for tabling abolition petitions without reading\r\nthem; he had publicly deprecated the work of abolition leaders; and,\r\nby his silence, had approved the mob spirit when his friends were\r\nbreaking up abolition meetings. But, in those days, American slavery\r\nwas simply seeking its constitutional right to exist unmolested where\r\nit was; and, although the anti-slavery crusade from 1830 to 1840, had\r\nprofoundly stirred the American conscience, slavery had not yet, to\r\nany extended degree, entered into partisan politics. The annexation of\r\nTexas, however, was an aggressive measure, the first of the great\r\nmovements for the extension of slavery since the Missouri Compromise;\r\nand it was important to the South to know in advance where the\r\nex-President stood. His administration had been adverse to annexation,\r\nand rumour credited him with unabated hostility. To force him into the\r\nopen, therefore, William H. Hammit, a member of Congress from\r\nMississippi, addressed him a letter on the 27th of March, 1844. \"I am\r\nan unpledged delegate to the Baltimore convention,\" wrote Hammit, \"and\r\nit is believed that a full and frank declaration of your opinion as to\r\nthe constitutionality and expediency of immediately annexing Texas\r\nwill be of great service to the cause, at a moment so critical of its\r\ndestiny.\"[327] Van Buren held this letter until the 20th of April,\r\nthirty-seven days before the meeting of the convention. When he did\r\nreply he recalled the fact that in 1837, after an exhaustive\r\nconsideration of the question, his administration had decided against\r\nannexation, and that nothing had since occurred to change the\r\nsituation; but that if, after the subject had been fully discussed, a\r\nCongress chosen with reference to the question showed that the popular\r\nwill favoured it, he would yield. It was a letter of great length,\r\nelaborately discussing every point directly or indirectly relating to\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 441.]\r\n\r\nVan Buren deeply desired the nomination, and if the South supported\r\nhim he was practically certain of it. It was in view of the necessity\r\nof such support that Van Buren's letter has been pronounced by a\r\nrecent biographer \"one of the finest and bravest pieces of political\r\ncourage, and deserves from Americans a long admiration.\"[328] Such\r\neulogy is worthily bestowed if Van Buren, at the time of the Hammit\r\nletter, fully appreciated the gravity of the situation; but there is\r\nno evidence that he understood the secret and hostile purpose which\r\nled up to the Hammit inquiry, and the letter itself is evidence that\r\nhe sought to conciliate the Southern wing of his party. Charles Jared\r\nIngersoll of Pennsylvania, in his diary of May 6, 1844, declares that\r\nnearly all of Van Buren's admirers and most of the Democratic press\r\nwere even then committed to annexation. Nevertheless, Van Buren and\r\nhis trusted advisers could not have known of the secret plotting of\r\nBuchanan's and Cass's followers, or of the deception shrewdly\r\npractised by Cave Johnson of Tennessee, ostensibly a confidential\r\nfriend, but really a leader in the plot to defeat Van Buren.[329]\r\nBesides, the sentiment of the country unmistakably recognised that\r\npowerful and weighty as the inducements for annexation appeared, they\r\nwere light when opposed in the scale of reason to the treaty of amity\r\nand commerce with Mexico, which must be scrupulously observed so long\r\nas that country performed its duties and respected treaty rights. Even\r\nafter the nomination of a President only sixteen senators out of\r\nfifty-one voted for annexation, proving that the belief still\r\nobtained, in the minds of a very large and influential portion of the\r\nparty, that annexation was decidedly objectionable, since it must\r\nlead, as Benton put it in his great speech delivered in May, 1844, to\r\nan unjust, unconstitutional war with Mexico upon a weak and groundless\r\npretext. Thus, Van Buren had behind him, the weight of the argument, a\r\nlarge majority of the Senate, including Silas Wright, his noble\r\nfriend, and a party sentiment that had not yet yielded to the crack of\r\nthe southern whip; and he was ignorant of the plan, already secretly\r\nmatured, to defeat him with the help of the followers of Buchanan and\r\nCass by insisting upon the two-thirds rule in the convention. Under\r\nthese circumstances, it did not require great courage to reaffirm his\r\nprevious views so forcibly and ably expressed. Cognisant, however, of\r\nthe growing desire in the South for annexation, he took good care to\r\nremove the impression that he was a hard-shell, by promising to yield\r\nhis opinion to the judgment of a new Congress. This was a long step\r\nin the direction of consent. It virtually said, \"If you elect a\r\nCongress that will ratify the treaty and pay the price, I will not\r\nstand in your way.\" In the presence of such complacency, the thought\r\nnaturally occurs that he might have gone a step farther and consented\r\nto yield his opinions at once had he known or even suspected the\r\nsecret plans of his southern opponents, the bitterness of Calhoun and\r\nRobert J. Walker, and their understanding with the friends of Buchanan\r\nand Cass. Jackson's letter favourable to annexation, skilfully\r\nprocured for publication just before the convention, \"to blow Van out\r\nof water,\" as his enemies expressed it, was, indeed, known to Van\r\nBuren, but the latter believed its influence discounted by the great\r\nconfidence Jackson subsequently expressed in his wisdom.[330]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: Edward M. Shepard, _Life of Martin Van Buren_, p. 407.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: \"Judge Fine, Mr. Butler, and other members of the New\r\nYork delegation, reposed great confidence in the opinions and\r\nstatements of Mr. Cave Johnson, of Tennessee. He frequently met with\r\nthe delegation, and expressed himself in the strongest terms of\r\npersonal and political friendship towards Mr. Van Buren and Mr.\r\nWright. He said he regretted that the Democratic convention in\r\nTennessee had not named Mr. Van Buren as the candidate. So strong was\r\nthe confidence in Mr. Johnson as a friend of Mr. Van Buren, that he\r\nwas apprised of all our plans in regard to the organisation of the\r\nconvention, and was requested to nominate Gov. Hubbard of New\r\nHampshire, as temporary chairman. But when the convention assembled\r\nGen. Saunders of North Carolina called the convention to order and\r\nnominated Hendrick B. Wright, of Pennsylvania, a friend of Mr.\r\nBuchanan, as temporary president. Messrs. Walker, Saunders, and Cave\r\nJohnson were the principal managers for the delegates from the\r\nsouthern section of the Union.\"--Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History\r\nof New York_, Vol. 3, p. 447.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: \"The danger of Van Buren's difference with Jackson it\r\nwas sought to avert. Butler visited Jackson at the Hermitage, and\r\ndoubtless showed him for what sinister end he had been used. Jackson\r\ndid not withdraw his approval of annexation; but publicly declared his\r\nregard for Van Buren to be so great, his confidence in Van Buren's\r\nlove of country to be so strengthened by long intimacy, that no\r\ndifference about Texas could change his opinion. But the work of\r\nCalhoun and Robert J. Walker had been too well done.\"--Edward M.\r\nShepard, _Life of Martin Van Buren_, p. 407.]\r\n\r\nThree days before the date of Van Buren's letter, Henry Clay, writing\r\nupon the same subject, expressed the opinion that annexation at this\r\ntime, without the assent of Mexico, would be a measure \"compromising\r\nthe national character, involving us certainly in war with Mexico,\r\nprobably with other foreign powers, dangerous to the integrity of the\r\nUnion, inexpedient to the present financial condition of the country,\r\nand not called for by any general expression of public opinion.\" Van\r\nBuren had visited Clay at Ashland in 1842, and, after the publication\r\nof their letters, it was suggested that a bargain had then been made\r\nto remove the question of annexation from politics. However this may\r\nbe, the friends of the ex-President, after the publication of his\r\nletter, understood, quickly and fully, the gravity of the situation.\r\nSubterranean activity was at its height all through the month of May.\r\nMen wavered and changed, and changed again. So great was the alarm\r\nthat leading men of Ohio addressed their delegation in Congress,\r\ninsisting upon Van Buren's support. It was a moment of great peril.\r\nThe agitators themselves became frightened. A pronounced reaction in\r\nfavour of Van Buren threatened to defeat their plans, and the better\r\nto conceal intrigue and tergiversation they deemed it wise to create\r\nthe belief that opposition had been wholly and finally abandoned. In\r\nthis they proved eminently successful. \"Many of the strongest\r\nadvocates of annexation,\" wrote a member of the New York delegation in\r\nCongress, on May 18, nine days before the convention, \"have come to\r\nregard the grounds taken by Van Buren as the only policy consistent\r\nnot only with the honour, but the true interests of the country. Such\r\nis fast becoming and will soon be the opinion of the whole South.\"[331]\r\nBut the cloud, at last, burst. No sooner had the Baltimore convention\r\nconvened than Benjamin F. Butler, the ardent friend and able spokesman\r\nof Van Buren, discovered that the backers of Cass and Buchanan were\r\nacting with the Southerners in the interest of a rule that required\r\ntwo-thirds of all the delegates in the convention to nominate.\r\nInstantly the air was thick with suggestion, devices, expedients. All\r\nthe arts of party emergency went on at an unprecedented rate. The\r\neloquent New Yorker, his clear, tenor voice trembling with emotion,\r\nfought the battle on the highest moral grounds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 444.]\r\n\r\nWith inexhaustible tenacity, force, and resource, he laboured to hold\r\nup to men's imagination and to burn into their understanding the shame\r\nand dishonour of adopting a rule, not only unsound and false in\r\nprinciple, but which, if adhered to, would coerce a majority to yield\r\nto a minority. \"I submit,\" declared Butler, in closing, \"that to adopt\r\na rule which requires what we know cannot be done, unless the majority\r\nyield to the minority, is to subject ourselves to the rule, not of\r\nreason, but of despotism, and to defeat the true purposes and objects\r\nof this convention--the accomplishment of the people's will for the\r\npromotion of the people's good.\"[332]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 450.\r\n\r\n\"The real contest took place over the adoption of the rule requiring a\r\ntwo-thirds vote for the nomination. For it was through this rule that\r\nenough Southern members, chosen before Van Buren's letter, were to\r\nescape obedience to their instructions to vote for him. Robert J.\r\nWalker, then a senator from Mississippi, a man of interesting history\r\nand large ability, led the Southerners. He quoted the precedent of\r\n1832 when Van Buren had been nominated for the Vice Presidency under\r\nthe two-thirds rule, and that of 1835, when he had been nominated for\r\nthe Presidency. These nominations had led to victory. In 1840 the rule\r\nhad not been adopted. Without this rule, he said amid angry\r\nexcitement, the party would yield to those whose motto seemed to be\r\n'rule or ruin.' Butler, Daniel S. Dickinson, and Marcus Morton led the\r\nNorthern ranks.... Morton said that under the majority rule Jefferson\r\nhad been nominated; that rule had governed state, county, and township\r\nconventions. Butler admitted that under the rule Van Buren would not\r\nbe nominated, although a majority of the convention was known to be\r\nfor him. In 1832 and 1835 the two-thirds rule had prevailed because it\r\nwas certainly known who would be nominated; and the rule operated to\r\naid not to defeat the majority. If the rule were adopted, it would be\r\nby the votes of States which were not Democratic, and would bring\r\n'dismemberment and final breaking up of the party.' Walker laughed at\r\nButler's 'tall vaulting' from the floor; and, refusing to shrink from\r\nthe Van Buren issue, he protested against New York dictation, and\r\nwarningly said that, if Van Buren were nominated, Clay would be\r\nelected.\"--Edward M. Shepard, _Life of Martin Van Buren_, p. 408.]\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the rule, by a vote of 148 to 118, showed that the\r\nDemocratic party did not have a passionate devotion for Martin Van\r\nBuren. Buchanan opposed his nomination; leading men in other States\r\ndid not desire him. The New England States, with Pennsylvania, Ohio,\r\nMichigan, Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, had\r\ninstructed for him; yet sixty-three of these instructed delegates\r\nvoted for the two-thirds rule, knowing that its adoption would defeat\r\nhim. The rule received thirty majority, and Van Buren, on the first\r\nballot, received only thirteen. On the second ballot he dropped to\r\nless than a majority; on the seventh he had only ninety-nine votes.\r\nThe excitement reached a climax when a motion to declare him the\r\nnominee by a majority vote, was ruled out of order. In the\r\npandemonium, the New Yorkers, for the first time, seemed to unloose\r\nthemselves, letting fly bitter denunciations of the treachery of the\r\nsixty-three delegates who were pledged to Van Buren's support. When\r\norder was restored, a Virginian suddenly put forward the name of James\r\nK. Polk as that of \"a pure, whole-hogged Democrat.\" Then the\r\nconvention adjourned until the next day.\r\n\r\nHarmony usually follows a bitter convention quarrel. Men become\r\nfuriously and sincerely indignant; but the defeated ones must accept\r\nthe results, or, Samson-like, destroy themselves in the destruction of\r\ntheir party. The next morning, Daniel S. Dickinson, the most violently\r\nindignant the day before, declared that \"he loved this convention\r\nbecause it had acted so like the masses.\" In a high state of nervous\r\nexcitement, Samuel Young had denounced \"the abominable Texas question\"\r\nas the firebrand thrown among them, but his manner now showed that he,\r\nalso, had buried the hatchet. Even the serene, philosophic Butler,\r\nwho, in \"an ecstacy of painful excitement,\" had \"leaped from the floor\r\nand stamped,\" to use the language of an eye-witness, now resumed his\r\nwonted calmness, and on the ninth ballot, in the midst of tremendous\r\ncheering, used the discretion vested in him to withdraw Van Buren's\r\nname. In doing so, he took occasion to indicate his preference for\r\nJames K. Polk, his personal friend. Following this announcement,\r\nDickinson cast New York's thirty-five votes for the Tennesseean, who\r\nimmediately received the necessary two-thirds vote. The situation had\r\ngiven Polk peculiar advantages. The partisans of Cass and Buchanan,\r\nhaving willingly defeated Van Buren, made the friends of the New\r\nYorker thirsty to put their knives into these betrayers. This\r\nsituation, opening the door for a compromise, brought a \"dark horse\"\r\ninto the race for the first time in the history of national\r\nconventions. Such conditions are common enough nowadays, but it may\r\nwell be doubted if modern political tactics ever brought to the\r\nsurface a more inferior candidate. \"Polk! Great God, what a\r\nnomination!\" wrote Governor Letcher of Kentucky to Buchanan.\r\n\r\nTo make the compromise complete, the convention, by acclamation,\r\nnominated Silas Wright for Vice President. But the man who had\r\nrecently declined a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, and who, after the defeat of Van Buren, had refused the use of\r\nhis name for President, did not choose, he said, \"to ride behind the\r\nblack pony.\" A third ballot resulted in the selection of George M.\r\nDallas of Pennsylvania. Among the resolutions adopted, it was declared\r\nthat \"our title to the whole of Oregon is clear and unquestionable;\r\nthat no portion of the same ought to be ceded to England or any other\r\npower; and the reoccupation of Oregon and the reannexation of Texas at\r\nthe earliest practicable period, are great American measures, which\r\nthe convention recommends to the cordial support of the Democracy of\r\nthe Union.\"\r\n\r\nVan Buren's defeat practically closed his career. His failure of\r\nre-election in 1840 had left his leadership unimpaired, but with the\r\nloss of the nomination in 1844 went prestige and power which he was\r\nnever to regain. Seldom has it been the misfortune of a candidate for\r\nPresident to experience so overwhelming an overthrow. Clay's failure\r\nin 1839 and Seward's in 1860 were as complete; but they lacked the\r\nhumiliating features of the Baltimore rout. Harrison was an equal\r\nfavourite with Clay in 1839; and at Chicago, in 1860, Lincoln shared\r\nwith Seward the prominence of a leading candidate; but at Baltimore,\r\nin 1844, no other name than Van Buren's appeared conspicuously above\r\nthe surface, until, with the help of delegates who had been instructed\r\nfor him, the two-thirds rule was adopted. It seemed to Van Buren the\r\nresult of political treachery; and it opened a chasm between him and\r\nhis former southern friends that was destined to survive during the\r\nremaining eighteen years of his life. The proscription of his New York\r\nfriends undoubtedly aided this division, and the death of Jackson, in\r\n1845, and rapidly accumulating political events which came to a climax\r\nin 1848, completed the separation.\r\n\r\nThere are evidences that Van Buren's defeat did not break the heart of\r\nhis party in New York. Contemporary writers intimate that after his\r\nelection as President the warm, familiar manners changed to the\r\nstiffer and more formal ways of polite etiquette, and that his visit\r\nto New York, during his occupancy of the White House, left behind it\r\nmany wounds, the result of real or fancied slights and neglect. Van\r\nBuren's rule had been long. His good pleasure sent men to Congress;\r\nhis good pleasure made them postmasters, legislators, and cabinet\r\nofficers. In all departments of the government, both state and\r\nnational, his influence had been enormous. For years his friends,\r\nsharing the glory and profits of his continued triumphs, had been\r\nfilling other ambitious men with envy and jealousy, until his\r\noverthrow seemed necessary to their success. Even Edwin Croswell\r\nshared this feeling, and, although he did not boldly play a double\r\npart, the astute editor was always seeking a position which promised\r\nthe highest advantage and the greatest security to himself and his\r\nfaction. This condition of mind made him quick to favour Polk and the\r\nannexation of Texas, and to leave Van Buren to his now limited coterie\r\nof followers.\r\n\r\nVan Buren had much liking for the career of a public man. Very\r\nprobably he found his greatest happiness in the triumphs of such a\r\nlife; but we must believe he also found great contentment in his\r\nretirement at Lindenwald. He did not possess the tastes and pleasures\r\nof a man of letters, nor did he affect the \"classic retirement\" that\r\nseemed to appeal so powerfully to men of the eighteenth century; but,\r\nlike John Jay, he loved the country, happy in his health, in his\r\nrustic tastes, in his freedom from public cares, and in his tranquil\r\noccupation. Skilled in horticulture, he took pleasure in planting\r\ntrees, and in cultivating, with his own hand, the fruits and flowers\r\nof his table. There can be no doubt of his entire sincerity when he\r\nassured an enthusiastic Pennsylvania admirer, who had pronounced for\r\nhim as a candidate in 1848, that whatever aspirations he may have had\r\nin the past, he now had no desire to be President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSILAS WRIGHT AND MILLARD FILLMORE\r\n\r\n1844\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York delegation, returning from the Baltimore convention,\r\nfound the Democratic party rent in twain over the gubernatorial\r\nsituation. So long as Van Buren seemed likely to be the candidate for\r\nPresident, opposition to Governor Bouck's renomination was smothered\r\nby the desire of the Radicals to unite with the Conservatives, and\r\nthus make sure of the State's electoral vote. This was the Van Buren\r\nplan. After the latter's defeat, however, the Radicals demanded the\r\nnomination of Silas Wright of Canton. Van Buren and Wright had taken\r\nno part in the canal controversy; but they belonged to the Radicals,\r\nand, with Wright, and with no one else, could the latter hope to\r\ndefeat the \"Agricultural Governor.\" Their importunity greatly\r\ndistressed the Canton statesman, who desired to remain in the United\r\nStates Senate, to which he had been recently re-elected for a third\r\nterm, and to whom, from every point of view, the governorship was\r\ndistasteful.[333] Besides taking him from the Senate, it meant\r\ncontention with two bitterly jealous and hostile factions, one of\r\nwhich would be displeased with impartiality, the other ready to plunge\r\nthe party into a fierce feud on the slightest show of partiality.\r\nTherefore, he firmly declined to be a candidate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 333: \"Next to the Presidency no place was so much desired, in\r\nthe times we are now reviewing, as that of senator of the United\r\nStates. The body was illustrious through the fame of its members, who\r\ngenerally exhibited the very flower and highest outcome of American\r\npolitical life; dignified, powerful, respected, it was the pride of\r\nthe nation, and one of its main bulwarks. The height of ordinary\r\nambition was satisfied by attainment to that place; and men once\r\nsecurely seated there would have been content to hold it on and on,\r\nasking no more. One cannot doubt the sincerity of the expressions in\r\nwhich Mr. Wright announced his distress at being thrown from that\r\ndelightful eminence into the whirlpools and quicksands at\r\nAlbany.\"--Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John Dix_, Vol. 1, pp. 194, 195.]\r\n\r\nBut the Albany _Atlas_, representing the Radicals, insisted upon\r\nWright's making the sacrifice; and, to give Bouck an easy avenue of\r\nescape, Edwin Croswell, representing the Conservatives, advised that\r\nthe Governor would withdraw if he should consent to stand. But he\r\nagain refused. Still the _Atlas_ continued to insist. By the middle of\r\nJuly things looked very black. In Albany, the atmosphere became thick\r\nwith political passion. Finally, Van Buren interfered. He was\r\nprofoundly affected with the idea that political treachery had\r\ncompassed his defeat, and he knew the nomination of Polk was\r\npersonally offensive to Silas Wright; but, faithful to his promise to\r\nsupport the action of the Baltimore convention, he requested his\r\nfriend to lead the state ticket, since the result in New York would\r\nprobably decide, as it did decide, the fate of the Democratic party in\r\nthe nation. Still the Senator refused. His decision, more critical\r\nthan he seemed to be aware, compelled his Radical friends to invent\r\nnew compromises, until the refusal was modified into a conditional\r\nconsent. In other words, he would accept the nomination provided he\r\nwas not placed in the position of opposing \"any Republican who is, or\r\nwho may become a candidate.\"\r\n\r\nThis action of the Radicals kept the Conservatives busy bailing a\r\nsinking boat. They believed the candidacy of Bouck would shut out\r\nWright under the terms of his letter, and, although the Governor's\r\nsupporters were daily detached by the action of county conventions,\r\nand the Governor himself wished to withdraw to avoid the humiliation\r\nof a defeat by ballot, the Conservatives continued their opposition.\r\nFor once it could be truthfully said of a candidate that he was \"in\r\nthe hands of his friends.\" Even the \"judicious\" delegate, whom the\r\nGovernor directed to withdraw his name, declined executing the\r\ncommission until a ballot had nominated Wright, giving him\r\nninety-five votes to thirty for Bouck. \"Wright's nomination is the\r\nfatality,\" wrote Seward. \"Election or defeat exhausts him.\"[334] Seward\r\nhad the gift of prophecy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 723.\r\n\r\n\"Wright was a strong man the day before his nomination for governor.\r\nHe fell far, and if left alone will be not, what he might have been,\r\nGeorge I. to William of Orange, lineal heir to Jackson, through Van\r\nBuren. The wiseacres in New York speak of him with compliment, 'this\r\ndistinguished statesman;' yet they bring all their small artillery to\r\nbear upon him, and give notice that he is demolished. The praise they\r\nbestow is very ill concealed, but less injurious to us than their\r\nwarfare, conducted in their mode.\"--Letter of W.H. Seward to Thurlow\r\nWeed, _Ibid._, Vol. 1, p. 725.]\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of the contest was further revealed in the refusal of\r\nDaniel S. Dickinson, a doughty Conservative, to accept a renomination\r\nfor lieutenant-governor, notwithstanding Silas Wright had especially\r\nasked it. There were many surmises, everybody was excited, and the\r\ndoor to harmony seemed closed forever; but it opened again when the\r\nname of Addison Gardiner of Rochester came up. Gardiner had been\r\nguided by high ideals. He was kind and tolerant; the voice of personal\r\nanger was never heard from his lips; and Conservative and Radical held\r\nhim in high respect. At Manlius, in 1821, Gardiner had become the\r\nclosest friend of Thurlow Weed, an intimacy that was severed only by\r\ndeath. He was a young lawyer then, anxious to seek his fortune in the\r\nWest, and on his way to Indianapolis happened to stop at Rochester.\r\nThe place proved too attractive to give up, and, through his\r\ninfluence, Weed also made it his residence. \"How curious it seems,\" he\r\nonce wrote his distinguished journalistic friend, \"that circumstances\r\nwhich we regard at the time as scarcely worthy of notice often change\r\nthe entire current of our lives.\" A few years later, through Weed's\r\ninfluence, Gardiner became a judge of the Supreme Court, laying the\r\nfoundation for a public life of honourable and almost unceasing\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThough the Whigs needed their ablest and most popular men to meet\r\nWright and Gardiner, preceding events guided the action of their state\r\nconvention, which met at Syracuse, on the 11th of September, 1844.\r\nHorace Greeley had picked out Millard Fillmore for the Vice Presidency\r\non the ticket with Henry Clay, and his New York friends, proud of his\r\nwork in Congress, as chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means,\r\npresented his name with the hope that other States, profiting by the\r\ntariff which he had framed, might join them in recognising his\r\nvaluable public service. But the convention had not taken kindly to\r\nhim, probably for the same reason that Greeley desired his promotion;\r\nfor, upon the slavery question, Fillmore had been more pronounced and\r\naggressive than Seward, sympathising and acting in Congress with\r\nGiddings of Ohio and John P. Hale of New Hampshire, a part very\r\ndifficult to perform in those days without losing caste as a Whig.\r\n\r\nFillmore's defeat on May 1, however, made him the candidate for\r\ngovernor on September 11. Weed pronounced for him very early, and the\r\nparty leaders fell into line with a unanimity that must have been as\r\nbalm to Fillmore's sores. \"I wish to say to you,\" wrote George W.\r\nPatterson to Weed, \"that you are right, as usual, on the question of\r\ngovernor. After Frelinghuysen was named for Vice President, it struck\r\nme that Fillmore above all others was the man. You may rest assured\r\nthat he will help Mr. Clay to a large number of good men's votes. Mr.\r\nClay's slaves and his old duel would have hurt him with some men who\r\nwill now vote the ticket. Fillmore is a favourite everywhere; and\r\namong the Methodists where 'old Father Fillmore' is almost worshipped,\r\nthey will go him with a rush.\"[335] Yet the Buffalo statesman, not a\r\nlittle disgruntled over his treatment at Baltimore, disclaimed any\r\ndesire for the nomination. To add to his chagrin, he was told that\r\nWeed and Seward urged his selection for his destruction, and whether\r\nhe believed the tale or not, it increased his fear and apprehension.\r\nBut people did not take his assumed indifference seriously, and he was\r\nunanimously nominated for governor, with Samuel J. Wilkin, of Orange,\r\nfor lieutenant-governor. Wilkin had been a leader of the Adams party\r\nin the Assembly of 1824 and 1825. He was then a young lawyer of much\r\npromise, able and clear-headed, and, although never a showy debater,\r\nhe possessed useful business talent, and an integrity that gave him\r\nhigh place among the men who guided his party. \"I like Wilkin for\r\nlieutenant-governor,\" wrote Seward, although he had been partial to\r\nthe selection of John A. King.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n121.]\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, each party had put forward, for governor, its most\r\navailable man. Fillmore was well known and at the height of his\r\npopularity. During the protracted and exciting tariff struggle of\r\n1842, he had sustained himself as chairman of the Ways and Means\r\nCommittee with marked ability. It added to his popularity, too, that\r\nhe had seemed indifferent to the nomination. In some respects Fillmore\r\nand Silas Wright were not unlike. They were distinguished for their\r\nsuavity of manners. Both were impressive and interesting characters,\r\nwise in council, and able in debate, with a large knowledge of their\r\nState and country; and, although belonging to opposite parties and in\r\ndifferent wings of the capitol at Washington, their service in\r\nCongress had brought to the debates a genius which compelled\r\nattention, and a purity of life that raised in the public estimation\r\nthe whole level of congressional proceedings. Neither was an orator;\r\nthey were clear, forcible, and logical; but their speeches were not\r\nquoted as models of eloquence. In spite of an unpleasant voice and a\r\nslow, measured utterance, there was a charm about Wright's speaking;\r\nfor, like Fillmore, he had earnestness and warmth. With all their\r\npower, however, they lacked the enthusiasm and the boldness that\r\ncaptivate the crowd and inspire majorities. Yet they had led\r\nmajorities. In no sphere of Wright's activities, was he more strenuous\r\nthan in the contest for the independent treasury plan which he\r\nrecommended to Van Buren, and which, largely through his efforts as\r\nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was finally forced into law\r\non the 4th of July, 1840. Fillmore, in putting some of the hated\r\ntaxes of 1828 into the tariff act of 1842, was no less strenuous,\r\ngrappling facts with infinite labour, until, at last, he overcame a\r\ncurrent of public opinion that seemed far too powerful for resistance.\r\n\r\nOf the two men, Silas Wright was undoubtedly the stronger character.\r\nHe was five years older than Fillmore, and his legislative experience\r\nhad been four or five years longer. His great intellectual power\r\npeculiarly fitted him for the United States Senate. He had chosen\r\nfinance as his specialty, and in its discussion had made a mark. He\r\ncould give high and grave counsel in great emergencies. His\r\ninexhaustible patience, his active attention and industry, his genius\r\nin overcoming impediments of every kind, made him the peer of the\r\nablest senator. He was not without ambitions for himself; but they\r\nwere always subordinate in him to the love of party and friends. It\r\nwill never be known how far he influenced Van Buren's reply to Hammit.\r\nHe bitterly opposed the annexation of Texas, and his conferences with\r\nthe ex-President must have encouraged the latter's adherence to his\r\nformer position. Van Buren's defeat, however, in no wise changed\r\nWright's attitude toward him. It is doubtful if the latter could have\r\nbeen nominated President at Baltimore had he allowed the use of his\r\nname, but it was greatly to his credit, showing the sincerity of his\r\nfriendship for Van Buren, that he spurned the suggestion and promptly\r\ndeclined a unanimous nomination for Vice President. Such action places\r\nhim in a very small group of American statesmen who have deliberately\r\nturned their backs upon high office rather than be untrue to friends.\r\n\r\nSilas Wright was strictly a party man. He came near subjecting every\r\nmeasure and every movement in his career to the test of party loyalty.\r\nHe started out in that way, and he kept it up until the end. In 1823\r\nhe sincerely favoured the choice of presidential electors by the\r\npeople, but, for the party's sake, he aided in defeating the measure.\r\nTwo years later, he preferred that the State be unrepresented in the\r\nUnited States Senate rather than permit the election of Ambrose\r\nSpencer, then the nominee of a Clintonian majority, and he used all\r\nhis skill to defeat a joint session of the two houses. For the sake of\r\nparty he now accepted the gubernatorial nomination. Desire to remain\r\nin the Senate, opposition to the annexation of Texas, dislike of\r\nparticipating in factional feuds, refusal to stand in the way of\r\nBouck's nomination, the dictates of his better judgment, all gave way\r\nto party necessity. He anticipated defeat for a second term should he\r\nnow be elected to a first, but it had no influence. The party needed\r\nhim, and, whatever the result to himself, he met it without complaint.\r\nThis was the man upon whom the Democrats relied to carry New York and\r\nto elect Polk.\r\n\r\nThere were other parties in the field. The Native Americans, organised\r\nearly in 1844, watched the situation with peculiar emotions. This\r\nparty had suddenly sprung up in opposition to the ease with which\r\nforeigners secured suffrage and office; and, although it shrewdly\r\navoided nominations for governor and President, it demoralised both\r\nparties by the strange and tortuous manoeuvres that had ended in the\r\nelection of a mayor of New York in the preceding spring. It operated,\r\nfor the most part, in that city, but its sympathisers covered the\r\nwhole State. Then, there was the anti-rent party, confined to Delaware\r\nand three or four adjoining counties, where long leases and trifling\r\nprovisions of forfeiture had exasperated tenants into acts of\r\nviolence. Like the Native Americans, these Anti-Renters avoided state\r\nand national nominations, and traded their votes to secure the\r\nelection of legislative nominees.\r\n\r\nBut the organisation which threatened calamity was the abolition or\r\nliberty party. It had nominated James G. Birney of Michigan for\r\nPresident and Alvan Stewart for governor, and, though no one expected\r\nthe election of either, the organisation was not unlikely to hold the\r\nbalance of power in the State. Stewart was a born Abolitionist and a\r\nlawyer of decided ability. In the section of the State bounded by\r\nOneida and Otsego counties, where he shone conspicuously as a leader\r\nfor a quarter of a century, his forensic achievements are still\r\nremembered. Stanton says he had no superior in central New York. \"His\r\nquaint humour was equal to his profound learning. He was skilled in a\r\npeculiar and indescribable kind of argumentation, wit, and sarcasm,\r\nthat made him remarkably successful out of court as well as in court.\r\nBefore anti-slavery conventions in several States he argued grave and\r\nintricate constitutional questions with consummate ability.\"[336]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 135.]\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the Anti-Renters and Native Americans would draw,\r\nperhaps, equally from Whigs and Democrats; but the ranks of\r\nAbolitionists could be recruited only from the anti-slavery Whigs.\r\nBehind Stewart stood Gerrit Smith, William Jay, Beriah Green, and\r\nother zealous, able, benevolent, pure-minded men--some of them\r\nwealthy. Their shibboleth was hostility to a slave-holder, or one who\r\nwould vote for a slave-holder. This barred Henry Clay and his\r\nelectors.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the Whigs plainly had the advantage. Spring elections\r\nhad resulted auspiciously, and the popularity of Clay seemed\r\nunfailing. He had avowed opposition to the annexation of Texas, and,\r\nalthough his letter was not based upon hostility to slavery and the\r\nslave trade, it was positive, highly patriotic, and in a measure\r\nsatisfactory to the anti-slavery Whigs. \"We are at the flood,\" Seward\r\nwrote Weed; \"our opponents at the ebb.\"[337] The nomination of Wright\r\nhad greatly strengthened the Democratic ticket, but the nomination of\r\nPolk, backed by the Texas resolution, weighted the party as with a\r\nball and chain. Edwin Croswell had characterised Van Buren's letter to\r\nHammit as \"a statesmanlike production,\" declaring that \"every American\r\nreader, not entirely under the dominion of prejudice, will admit the\r\nforce of his conclusions.\"[338] This was the view generally held by the\r\nparty throughout the State; yet, within a month, every American reader\r\nwho wished to remain loyal to the Democratic party was compelled to\r\nchange his mind. In making this change, the \"slippery-elm editor,\" as\r\nCroswell came to be known because of the nearness of his office to the\r\nold elm tree corner in Albany, led the way and the party followed. It\r\nwas a rough road for many who knew they were consigning to one grave\r\nall hope of ending the slavery agitation, while they were resurrecting\r\nfrom another, bitter and dangerous controversies that had been laid to\r\nrest by the Missouri Compromise. Yet only one poor little protest, and\r\nthat intended for private circulation, was heard in opposition, the\r\nsigners, among them William Cullen Bryant, declaring their intention\r\nto vote for Polk, but to repudiate any candidate for Congress who\r\nagreed with Polk. Bryant's purpose was palpable and undoubted; but it\r\nsoon afterward became part of his courage not to muffle plain truth\r\nfrom any spurious notions of party loyalty, and part of his glory not\r\nto fail to tell what people could not fail to see.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 699.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 441, _note_.]\r\n\r\nAs the campaign advanced, the Whig side of it resembled the contest of\r\n1840. The log cabin did not reappear, and the drum and cannon were\r\nless noisy, but ash poles, cut from huge trees and spliced one to\r\nanother, carried high the banner of the statesman from Ashland.\r\nCampaign songs, with choruses for \"Harry of the West,\" emulated those\r\nof \"Old Tip,\" and parades by day and torch-light processions by night,\r\nincreased the enthusiasm. The Whigs, deeply and personally attached to\r\nHenry Clay, made mass-meetings as common and nearly as large as those\r\nheld four years before. Seward speaks of fifteen thousand men gathered\r\nat midday in Utica to hear Erastus Root, and of a thousand unable to\r\nenter the hall at night while he addressed a thousand more within.\r\nFillmore expressed the fear that Whigs would mistake these great\r\nmeetings for the election, and omit the necessary arrangements to get\r\nthe vote out. \"I am tired of mass-meetings,\" wrote Seward. \"But they\r\nwill go on.\"[339]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 723.]\r\n\r\nSeward and Weed were not happy during this campaign. The friends of\r\nClay, incensed at his defeat in 1840, had pronounced them the chief\r\nconspirators. Murmurs had been muffled until after Tyler's betrayal of\r\nthe party and Seward's retirement, but when these sources of possible\r\nfavours ran dry, the voice of noisy detraction reached Albany and\r\nAuburn. It was not an ordinary scold, confined to a few conservatives;\r\nbut the censure of strong language, filled with vindictiveness,\r\ncharged Weed with revolutionary theories, tending to unsettle the\r\nrights of property, and Seward with abolition notions and a desire to\r\nwin the Irish Catholic vote for selfish purposes. In February, 1844,\r\nit was not very politely hinted to Seward that he go abroad during the\r\ncampaign; and by June, Weed talked despondingly, proposing to leave\r\nthe _Journal_. Seward had the spirit of the Greeks. \"If you resign,\"\r\nhe said, \"there will be no hope left for ten thousand men who hold on\r\nbecause of their confidence in you and me.\"[340] In another month Weed\r\nhad become the proprietor as well as the editor of the _Evening\r\nJournal_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 719.\r\n\r\n\"I think you cannot leave the _Journal_ without giving up the whole\r\narmy to dissension and overthrow. I agree that if, by remaining, you\r\nsave it, you only draw down double denunciation upon yourself and me.\r\nNor do I see the way through and beyond that. But there will be some\r\nway through. I grant, then, that, for yourself and me, it is wise and\r\nprofitable that you leave. I must be left without the possibility of\r\nrestoration, without a defender, without an organ. Nothing else will\r\nsatisfy those who think they are shaded. Then, and not until then,\r\nshall I have passed through the not unreasonable punishment for too\r\nmuch success. But the party--the country? They cannot bear your\r\nwithdrawal. I think I am not mistaken in this. Let us adhere, then.\r\nStand fast. It is neither wise nor reasonable that we should bear the\r\ncensure of defeat, when we have been deprived of not merely command,\r\nbut of a voice in council.\"--W.H. Seward to Thurlow Weed, _Ibid._,\r\nVol. 1, p. 720.]\r\n\r\nAs the campaign grew older, however, Clay's friends gladly availed\r\nthemselves of Seward's influence with anti-slavery Whigs and\r\nnaturalised citizens. \"It is wonderful what an impulse the nomination\r\nof Polk has given to the abolition sentiment,\" wrote Seward. \"It has\r\nalready expelled other issues from the public mind. Our Whig central\r\ncommittee, who, a year ago, voted me out of the party for being an\r\nAbolitionist, has made abolition the war-cry in their call for a\r\nmass-meeting.\"[341] Even the sleuth-hounds of No-popery were glad to\r\ninvite Seward to address the naturalised voters, whose hostility to\r\nthe Whigs, in 1844, resembled their dislike of the Federalists in\r\n1800. \"It is a sorry consolation for this ominous aspect of things,\"\r\nhe wrote Weed, \"that you and I are personally exempt from the\r\nhostility of this class toward our political associates.\"[342]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 718.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 342: _Ibid._, p. 723.]\r\n\r\nYet no man toiled more sedulously in this campaign than Seward.\r\n\"Harrison had his admirers, Clay his lovers,\" is the old way of\r\nputting it. To elect him, Whigs were ready to make any sacrifice, to\r\nendure any hardship, and to yield every prejudice. Fillmore was\r\nubiquitous, delivering tariff and anti-Texas speeches that filled all\r\nmouths with praise and all hearts with principle, as Seward expressed\r\nit. An evident desire existed on the part of many in both parties, to\r\navoid a discussion of the annexation of Texas, and its consequent\r\nextension of slavery, lest too much or too little be said; but leaders\r\nlike Seward and Fillmore were too wise to believe that they could fool\r\nthe people by concealing the real issue. \"Texas and slavery are at war\r\nwith the interests, the principles, the sympathies of all,\" boldly\r\ndeclared the unmuzzled Auburn statesman. \"The integrity of the Union\r\ndepends on the result. To increase the slave-holding power is to\r\nsubvert the Constitution; to give a fearful preponderance which may,\r\nand probably will, be speedily followed by demands to which the\r\nDemocratic free-labour States cannot yield, and the denial of which\r\nwill be made the ground of secession, nullification and disunion.\"[343]\r\nThis was another of Seward's famous prophecies. At the time it seemed\r\nextravagant, even to the strongest anti-slavery Whigs, but the future\r\nverified it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: _Ibid._, p. 727.]\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, however, did not, as in 1840, have a monopoly of the\r\nenthusiasm. The public only half apprehended, or refused to apprehend\r\nat all, the danger in the Texas scheme; and, after the first chill of\r\ntheir immersion, the Democrats rallied with confidence to the support\r\nof their ticket. Abundant evidence of their strength had manifested\r\nitself at each state election since 1841, and, although no trailing\r\ncloud of glory now testified to a thrifty and skilful management, as\r\nin 1836, the two factions, in spite of recent efforts to baffle and\r\ndefeat each other, pulled themselves together with amazing quickness.\r\nIndeed, if we may rely upon Whig letters of the time, the Democrats\r\nexhibited the more zeal and spirit throughout the campaign. They had\r\ntheir banners, their songs, and their processions. In place of ash,\r\nthey raised hickory poles, and instead of defending Polk, they\r\nattacked Clay. Other candidates attracted little attention. Clay was\r\nthe commanding, central figure, and over him the battle raged. There\r\nwere two reasons for this. One was the fear of a silent free-soil\r\nvote, which the Bryant circular had alarmed in his favour. The other\r\nwas a desire to strengthen the liberty party, and to weaken the Whigs\r\nby holding up Clay as a slave-holder. The cornerstone of that party\r\nwas hostility to the slave-holder; and if a candidate, however much he\r\nopposed slavery, owned a single slave, it excluded him from its\r\nsuffrage. This was the weak point in Clay's armour, and the one of\r\nmost peril to the Whigs. To meet it, the latter argued, with some show\r\nof success, that the conflict is not with one slave-holder, or with\r\nmany, but with slavery; and since the admission of Texas meant the\r\nextension of that institution, a vote for Clay, who once advocated\r\nemancipation in Kentucky and is now strongly opposed to Texas, is a\r\nvote in behalf of freedom.\r\n\r\nIn September, Whig enthusiasm underwent a marked decline. Clay's July\r\nletter to his Alabama correspondent, as historic now as it was\r\nsuperfluous and provoking then, had been published, in which he\r\nexpressed a wish to see Texas added to the Union \"upon just and fair\r\nterms,\" and hazarded the opinion that \"the subject of slavery ought\r\nnot to affect the question one way or the other.\"[344] This letter was\r\nthe prototype of the famous alliteration, \"Rum, Romanism, and\r\nRebellion,\" in the Blaine campaign of 1884. Immediately Clay's most\r\nactive anti-slavery supporters were in revolt. \"We had the\r\nAbolitionists in a good way,\" wrote Washington Hunt from Lockport;\r\n\"but Mr. Clay seems determined that they shall not be allowed to vote\r\nfor him. I believe his letter will lose us more than two hundred votes\r\nin this county.\"[345] The effects of the dreadful blow are as briefly\r\nsummed up by Seward: \"I met _that letter_ at Geneva, and thence here,\r\nand now everybody droops, despairs. It jeopards, perhaps loses, the\r\nState.\"[346] A few weeks later, in company with several friends,\r\nSeward, as was his custom, made an estimate of majorities, going over\r\nthe work several times and taking accurate account of the drift of\r\npublic sentiment. An addition of the columns showed the Democrats\r\nseveral thousands ahead. Singularly enough, Fillmore, whose accustomed\r\ndespondency exhibited itself even in 1840, now became confident of\r\nsuccess. This can be accounted for, perhaps, on the theory that to a\r\ncandidate the eve of an election is \"dim with the self-deceiving\r\ntwilight of sophistry.\" He believed in his own safety even if Clay\r\nfailed. Although the deep, burning issue of slavery had not yet roused\r\npopular forces into dangerous excitement, Fillmore had followed the\r\nlead of Giddings and Hale, sympathising deeply with the restless flame\r\nthat eventually guided the policy of the North with such admirable\r\neffect. On the other hand, Wright approved his party's doctrine of\r\nnon-interference with slavery. He had uniformly voted to table\r\npetitions for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,\r\ndeclaring that any interference with the system, in that district, or\r\nin the territories, endangered the rights of their citizens, and\r\nwould be a violation of faith toward those who had settled and held\r\nslaves there. He voted for the admission of Arkansas and Florida as\r\nslave States; and his opposition to Texas was based wholly upon\r\nreasons other than the extension of slavery. The Abolitionists\r\nunderstood this, and Fillmore confidently relied upon their aid,\r\nalthough they might vote for Birney instead of Clay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: Private letter, Henry Clay to Stephen Miller,\r\nTuscaloosa, Ala., July 1, 1844.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 724.]\r\n\r\nThat Seward rightly divined public sentiment was shown by the result.\r\nPolk carried the State by a plurality of little more than five\r\nthousand, and Wright by ten thousand, while Stewart polled over\r\nfifteen thousand votes.[347] These last figures told the story. Four\r\nyears before, Birney had received less than seven thousand votes in\r\nthe whole country; now, in New York, the Abolitionists, exceeding\r\ntheir own anticipations, held the balance of power.[348] Had their\r\nvotes been cast for Clay and Fillmore both would have carried New\r\nYork, and Clay would have become the Chief Executive. \"Until Mr. Clay\r\nwrote his letter to Alabama,\" said Thurlow Weed, dispassionately, two\r\nyears afterward, \"his election as President was certain.\"[349]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: Silas Wright, 241,090; Millard Fillmore, 231,057; Alvan\r\nStewart, 15,136.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: In 1840 Gerrit Smith received 2662; in 1842 Alvan\r\nStewart polled 7263.--_Ibid._, p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n572.]\r\n\r\nClay's defeat was received by his devoted followers as the knell of\r\ntheir hopes. For years they had been engaged labourously in rolling\r\nuphill the stone of Sisyphus, making active friendships and seeking a\r\nfair trial. That opportunity had come at last. It had been an affair\r\nof life or death; the contest was protracted, intense, dramatic; the\r\nissue for a time had hung in poignant doubt; but the dismal result let\r\nthe stone roll down again to the bottom of the hill. No wonder stout\r\nmen cried, and that thousands declared the loss of all further\r\ninterest in politics. To add to their despair and resentment, the\r\nparty of Birney and Stewart exulted over its victory not less than the\r\nparty of Polk and Silas Wright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF JOHN YOUNG\r\n\r\n1845-1846\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Democrats were again successful in electing a governor\r\nand President, their victory had not healed the disastrous schism that\r\ndivided the party. The rank and file throughout the State had not yet\r\nrecognised the division into Radicals and Conservatives; but the\r\nmembers of the new Legislature foresaw, in the rivalries of leaders,\r\nthe approach of a marked crisis, the outcome of which they awaited\r\nwith an overshadowing sense of fear.\r\n\r\nThe strife of programmes began in the selection of a speaker. Horatio\r\nSeymour was the logical candidate. Of the Democratic members of the\r\nlast Assembly, he was the only one returned. He had earned the\r\npreferment by able service, and a disposition obtained generally among\r\nmembers to give him the right of way; but the state officials had not\r\nforgotten and could not forget that Seymour, whose supple and\r\ntrenchant blade had opened a way through the ranks of the Radicals for\r\nthe passage of the last canal appropriation, had further sinned by\r\nmarshalling Governor Bouck's forces at the Syracuse convention on\r\nSeptember 4, 1844; and to teach him discretion and less independence,\r\nthey promptly warned him of their opposition by supporting William C.\r\nCrain of Herkimer, a fierce Radical of the Hoffman school and a man of\r\nsome ability. Though the ultimate decision favoured Seymour, Azariah\r\nC. Flagg, the state comptroller, resolutely exhausted every device of\r\nstrategy and tactics to avert it. He summoned the canal board, who, in\r\nturn, summoned to Albany their up-state employees, mindful of the\r\nlatter's influence with the unsophisticated legislators already\r\nhaunted by the fear of party disruption. To limit the issue, Governor\r\nWright was quoted as favourable to Crain, and, although it\r\nsubsequently became known that he had expressed no opinion save one of\r\nentire indifference, this added to the zeal of the up-state Radicals,\r\nwho now showed compliance with every hint of their masters.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all Horatio Seymour remained undaunted. No one had\r\nbetter poise, or firmer patience, or possessed more adroit methods.\r\nThe personal attractions of the man, his dignity of manner, his\r\nfinished culture, and his ability to speak often in debate with\r\nacceptance, had before attracted men to him; now he was to reveal the\r\nnew and greater power of leadership. Seymour's real strength as a\r\nfactor in state affairs seems to date from this contest. It is\r\ndoubtful if he would have undertaken it had he suspected the\r\nfierceness of the opposition. He was not ambitious to be speaker. So\r\nfar as it affected him personally, he had every motive to induce him\r\nto remain on the floor, where his eloquence and debating power had won\r\nhim such a place. But, once having announced his candidacy he pushed\r\non with energy, sometimes masking his movements, sometimes mining and\r\ncountermining; yet always conscious of the closeness of the race and\r\nof the necessity of keeping his activity well spiced with good nature.\r\nBack of him stood Edwin Croswell. The astute editor of the _Argus_\r\nrecognised in Horatio Seymour, so brilliant in battle, so strong in\r\ncouncil, the future hope of the Democratic party. It is likely, too,\r\nthat Croswell already foresaw that Van Buren's opposition to the\r\nannexation of Texas, and the growing Free-soil sentiment, must\r\ninevitably occasion new party alignments; and the veteran journalist,\r\nwho had now been a party leader for nearly a quarter of a century,\r\nunderstood the necessity of having available and successful men ready\r\nfor emergencies. Under his management, therefore, and to offset the\r\ninfluence of the canal board's employees, Conservative postmasters and\r\nConservative sheriffs came to Albany, challenging their Radical canal\r\nopponents to a measurement of strength. When, finally, the caucus\r\nacted, the result showed how closely divided were the factions. Of\r\nseventy Democrats in the Assembly, sixty-five were present, and of\r\nthese thirty-five voted for Seymour.\r\n\r\nThe irritation and excitement of this contest were in a measure\r\nallayed by an agreement to renominate Azariah C. Flagg for comptroller\r\nof state. His ability and his service warranted it. He had performed\r\nthe multiplying duties of the office with fidelity; and, although\r\nchief of the active Radicals, the recollection of his stalwart aid in\r\nthe great financial panic of 1837, and in the preparation and advocacy\r\nof the act of 1842, gave him a support that no other candidate could\r\ncommand. It was also in the minds of two or three members holding the\r\nbalance of power between the factions, to add to the harmony by\r\nsecuring an even division of the other four state offices. In carrying\r\nout their project, however, the gifted Croswell took good care that\r\nSamuel Young, whose zeal and ability especially endeared him to the\r\nRadicals, should be beaten for secretary of state by one vote, and\r\nthat Thomas Farrington, another favourite Radical, should fail of\r\nre-election as treasurer of state. Since Young and Farrington were the\r\nonly state officers, besides Flagg, seeking re-election, it looked as\r\nif their part in the speakership struggle had marked them for defeat,\r\na suspicion strengthened by the fact that two Radicals, who took no\r\npart in that contest, were elected attorney-general and\r\nsurveyor-general.\r\n\r\nReproachful ironies and bitter animosity, boding ill for future\r\nharmony, now followed the factions into a furious and protracted\r\ncaucus for the selection of United States senators in place of Silas\r\nWright and Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, the latter having resigned to\r\naccept the governorship of Wisconsin.[350] The Conservatives supported\r\nDaniel S. Dickinson and Henry A. Foster; the Radicals John A. Dix and\r\nMichael Hoffman. There was more, however, at stake than the selection\r\nof two senators; for the President would probably choose a member of\r\nhis Cabinet from the stronger faction; and to have time to recruit\r\ntheir strength, the programme of the Radicals included an adjournment\r\nof the caucus after nominating candidates for the unexpired terms of\r\nWright and Tallmadge. This would possibly give them control of the\r\nfull six years' term to begin on the 4th of the following March. A\r\nmajority of the caucus, however, now completely under the influence of\r\nEdwin Croswell and Horatio Seymour, concluded to do one thing at a\r\ntime, and on the first ballot Dix was nominated for Wright's place,\r\ngiving him a term of four years. The second ballot named Dickinson for\r\nthe remaining month of Tallmadge's term. Then came the climax--the\r\nmotion to adjourn. Instantly the air was thick with suggestions.\r\nCoaxing and bullying held the boards. All sorts of proposals came and\r\nvanished with the breath that floated them; and, though the hour\r\napproached midnight, a Conservative majority insisted upon finishing\r\nthe business. The election of Dix for a term of four years, they said,\r\nhad given the Radicals fair representation. Still, the latter\r\nclamoured for an adjournment. But the Conservatives, inexorable,\r\ndemanded a third ballot, and it gave Dickinson fifty-four out of\r\nninety-three members present. When the usual motion to make the\r\nnomination unanimous was bitterly opposed, Horatio Seymour took the\r\nfloor, and with the moving charm and power of his voice, with temper\r\nunbroken, he made a fervid appeal for harmony. But bitterness ruled\r\nthe midnight hour; unanimity still lacked thirty-nine votes. As the\r\nRadicals passed out into the frosty air, breaking the stillness with\r\ntheir expletives, the voice of the tempter suggested a union with the\r\nWhigs for the election of Samuel Young. There was abundant precedent\r\nto support the plan. Bailey had bolted Woodworth's nomination; German\r\nhad defeated Thompson; and, in 1820, Rufus King had triumphed over\r\nSamuel Young. But these were the tactics of DeWitt Clinton. In 1845,\r\nthe men who aspired to office, the men with a past and the men who\r\nlooked for a future, had no words of approval for such methods; and\r\nbefore the Whigs heard of the scheme, Samuel Young had stamped it to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: \"On that occasion the feud between the two sections of\r\nthe party was disclosed in all its intensity. The conflict, which was\r\nsharp and ended in the election of Daniel S. Dickinson for the\r\nsix-years term, in spite of the strong opposition of the Radical\r\nmembers of the caucus, was a triumph for the Conservatives, and a\r\ndefeat for the friends of Governor Wright. The closing years of the\r\ngreat statesman's life were overcast by shadows; adverse influences\r\nwere evidently in the ascendant, not only at Washington, but close\r\nabout him and at home.\"--Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 1,\r\np. 194.]\r\n\r\nTo add to the chagrin of the Radicals, President Polk now invited\r\nWilliam L. Marcy, a Conservative of great prestige, to become\r\nsecretary of war. The Radicals did not know, and perhaps could not\r\nknow the exact condition of things at the national capital; certainly\r\nthey did not know how many elements of that condition told against\r\nthem. President Polk, apparently with a desire of treating his New\r\nYork friends fairly, asked Van Buren to recommend a New Yorker for his\r\nCabinet; and, with the approval of Silas Wright, the former President\r\nurged Benjamin F. Butler for secretary of state, or Azariah C. Flagg\r\nfor secretary of the treasury. Either of these men would have filled\r\nthe place designated with great ability. Polk was largely indebted to\r\nVan Buren and his friends; Butler had given him the vote of New York,\r\nand Wright, by consenting to stand for governor at the urgent\r\nsolicitation of Van Buren, had carried the State and thus made\r\nDemocratic success possible. But Polk, more interested in future\r\nsuccess than in the payment of past indebtedness, had an eye out for\r\n1848. He wanted a man devoted solely to his interests and to the\r\nannexation of Texas; and, although Butler was a personal friend and an\r\nornament to the American bar, he hesitated, despite the insistence of\r\nVan Buren and Wright, to make a secretary of state out of the most\r\ndevoted of Van Buren's adherents, who, like the sage of Lindenwald\r\nhimself, bitterly opposed annexation.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency, the tactics of Edwin Croswell came to Polk's\r\nrelief. The former knew that Silas Wright could not, if he would,\r\naccept a place in the Cabinet, since he had repeatedly declared during\r\nthe campaign that, if elected, he would not abandon the governorship\r\nto enter the Cabinet, as Van Buren did in 1829. Croswell knew, also,\r\nthat Butler, having left the Cabinet of two Presidents to re-enter his\r\nprofession, would not give it up for a secondary place among Polk's\r\nadvisers. At the editor's suggestion, therefore, the President\r\ntendered Silas Wright the head of the treasury, and, upon his\r\ndeclination, an offer of the secretaryship of war came to Butler. The\r\nlatter said he would have taken, although with reluctance, either the\r\nstate or treasury department; but the war portfolio carried him too\r\nfar from the line of his profession. Thus the veteran editor's scheme,\r\nhaving worked itself out as anticipated, left the President at\r\nliberty, without further consultation with Van Buren, to give William\r\nL. Marcy[351] what Butler had refused. To the Radicals the result was\r\nas startling as it was unwelcome. It left the Conservatives in\r\nauthority. Through Marcy they would command the federal patronage, and\r\nthrough their majority in the Legislature they could block the wheels\r\nof their opponents. It was at this time that the Conservatives,\r\n\"hankering,\" it was said, after the offices to be given by an\r\nAdministration committed to the annexation of Texas, were first called\r\n\"Hunkers.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 351: \"On the great question that loomed threateningly on the\r\nhorizon, Wright and Marcy took opposite sides. Wright moved calmly\r\nalong with the advancing liberal sentiment of the period, and died a\r\nfirm advocate of the policy of the Wilmot Proviso. On this test\r\nmeasure Marcy took no step forward.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random\r\nRecollections_, p. 40.]\r\n\r\nJohn Young, a Whig member of the Assembly, no sooner scented the\r\nincreasingly bitter feeling between Hunker and Radical than he\r\nprepared to take advantage of it. Young was a great surprise to the\r\nolder leaders. He had accomplished nothing in the past to entitle him\r\nto distinction. In youth he accompanied his father, a Vermont\r\ninnkeeper, to Livingston County, where he received a common school\r\neducation and studied law, being admitted to the bar in 1829, at the\r\nage of twenty-seven. Two years later he served a single term in the\r\nAssembly, and for ten years thereafter he had confined his attention\r\nalmost exclusively to his profession, becoming a strong jury lawyer.\r\nIn the meantime, he changed his politics from a firm supporter of\r\nAndrew Jackson to a local anti-masonic leader, and finally to a\r\nfollower of Henry Clay. Then the Whigs sent him to Congress, and, in\r\nthe fall of 1843, elected him to the celebrated Assembly through which\r\nHoratio Seymour forced the canal appropriation. But John Young seems\r\nto have made little more of a reputation in this historic struggle\r\nthan he did as a colleague of Millard Fillmore in the Congress that\r\npassed the tariff act of 1842. He did not remain silent, but neither\r\nhis words nor his acts conveyed any idea of the gifts which he was\r\ndestined to disclose in the various movements of a drama that was now,\r\nday by day, through much confusion and bewilderment, approaching a\r\nclimax. From a politician of local reputation, he leaped to the\r\ndistinction of a state leader. If unnoticed before, he was now the\r\nobserved of all observers. This transition, which came almost in a\r\nday, surprised the Democrats no less than it excited the Whigs; for\r\nYoung lifted a minority into a majority, and from a hopeless defeat\r\nwas destined to lead his party to glorious victory. \"With talents of a\r\nhigh order,\" says Hammond, \"with industry, with patient perseverance,\r\nand with a profound knowledge of men, he was one of the ablest party\r\nleaders and most skilful managers in a popular body that ever entered\r\nthe Assembly chamber.\"[352] Hammond, writing while Young was governor,\r\ndid not express the view of Thurlow Weed, who was unwilling to accept\r\ntact and cunning for great intellectual power. But there is no doubt\r\nthat Young suddenly showed uncommon parliamentary ability, not only as\r\na debater, owing to his good voice and earnest, persuasive manner, but\r\nas a skilful strategist, who strengthened coolness, courtesy, and\r\ncaution with a readiness to take advantage of the supreme moment to\r\ncarry things his way. Within a month, he became an acknowledged master\r\nof parliamentary law, easily bringing order out of confusion by a few\r\nsimple, clear, compact sentences. If his learning did not rank him\r\namong the Sewards and the Seymours, he had no occasion to fear an\r\nantagonist in the field on which he was now to win his leadership.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 537.]\r\n\r\nThe subject under consideration was the calling of a constitutional\r\nconvention. The preceding Legislature, hoping to avoid a convention,\r\nhad proposed several amendments which the people approved in the\r\nelection of 1844; but the failure of the present Legislature to ratify\r\nthem by a two-thirds majority, made a convention inevitable, and the\r\nquestion now turned upon the manner of its calling and the approval of\r\nits work. The Hunkers, with the support of the Governor, desired first\r\nto submit the matter to the people; and, if carried by a majority\r\nvote, taking as a test the number of votes polled at the last\r\nelection, the amendments were to be acted upon separately. This was\r\nthe plan of Governor Clinton in 1821. On the other hand, the Whigs,\r\nthe Anti-Renters, and the Native Americans insisted that the\r\nLegislature call a convention, and that its work be submitted, as a\r\nwhole, to the people, as in 1821. This the Hunkers resisted to the\r\nbitter end. An obstacle suddenly appeared, also, in the conduct of\r\nWilliam C. Grain, who thought an early and unlimited convention\r\nnecessary. Michael Hoffman held the same view, believing it the only\r\nmethod of getting the act of 1842 incorporated into the organic law of\r\nthe State. Upon the latter's advice, therefore, Crain introduced a\r\nbill in the Assembly similar to the convention act of 1821. It was\r\ncharged, at the time, that Crain's action was due to resentment\r\nbecause of his defeat for speaker, and that the Governor, in filling\r\nthe vacancy occasioned by the transfer of Samuel Nelson to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, had added to his indignation by\r\noverlooking the claims of Michael Hoffman. It is not improbable that\r\nCrain, irritated by his defeat, did resent the action of the Governor,\r\nalthough it was well known that Hoffman had not sought a place on the\r\nSupreme bench. But, in preferring an unlimited constitutional\r\nconvention, Crain and Hoffman expressed the belief of the most\r\neminent lawyers of the Commonwealth, that the time had come for\r\nradical changes in the Constitution, and that these could not be\r\nobtained unless the work of a convention was submitted in its entirety\r\nto the people and approved by a majority vote.\r\n\r\nCrain's bill was quickly pigeon-holed by the select committee to which\r\nit was referred, and John Young's work began when he determined to\r\nhave it reported. There had been little difficulty in marshalling a\r\nthird of the Assembly to defeat the constitutional amendments proposed\r\nby the preceding Legislature, since Whigs, Anti-Renters, and Native\r\nAmericans numbered fifty-four of the one hundred and twenty-eight\r\nmembers; but, to overcome a majority of seventeen, required Young's\r\npatient attendance, day after day, watchful for an opportunity to make\r\na motion whenever the Hunkers, ignorant of his design, were reduced by\r\ntemporary absences to an equality with the minority. Finally, the\r\nsought-for moment came, and, with Crain's help, Young carried a motion\r\ninstructing the committee to report the Crain bill without amendment,\r\nand making it the special order for each day until disposed of. It was\r\na staggering blow. The air was thick with suggestions, contrivances,\r\nexpedients, and embryonic proposals. The Governor, finding Crain\r\ninexorable, sent for Michael Hoffman; but the ablest Radical in the\r\nState refused to intervene, knowing that if the programme proposed by\r\nWright was sustained, the Whigs would withdraw their support and leave\r\nthe Hunkers in control.\r\n\r\nWhen the debate opened, interest centred in the course taken by the\r\nRadicals, who accepted the principle of the bill, but who demurred\r\nupon details and dreaded to divide their party. To this controlling\r\ngroup, therefore, were arguments addressed and appeals made. Hammond\r\npronounced it \"one of the best, if not the best, specimens of\r\nparliamentary discussion ever exhibited in the capital of the\r\nState.\"[353] Other writers have recorded similar opinions. It was\r\ncertainly a memorable debate, but it was made so by the serious\r\npolitical situation, rather than by the importance of the subject.\r\nHoratio Seymour led his party, and, though other Hunkers participated\r\nwith credit, upon the Speaker fell the brunt of the fight. He\r\ndispensed with declamation, he avoided bitter words, he refused to\r\ncrack the party whip; but with a deep, onflowing volume of argument\r\nand exhortation, his animated expressions, modulated and well\r\nbalanced, stirred the emotions and commanded the closest attention.\r\nSeymour had an instinct \"for the hinge or turning point of a debate.\"\r\nHe had, also, a never failing sense of the propriety, dignity, and\r\nmoderation with which subjects should be handled, or \"the great\r\nendearment of prudent and temperate speech\" as Jeremy Taylor calls it;\r\nand, although he could face the fiercest opposition with the keenest\r\nblade, his utterances rarely left a sting or subjected him to\r\ncriticism. This gift was one secret of his great popularity, and daily\r\nrumours, predicted harmony before a vote could be reached. As the\r\nstormy scenes which marked the progress of the bill continued,\r\nhowever, the less gifted Hunkers did not hesitate to declare the party\r\ndissolved unless the erring Radicals fell into line.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 544.]\r\n\r\nJohn Young, who knew the giant burden he had taken up, showed himself\r\nacute, frank, patient, closely attentive, and possessed of remarkable\r\npowers of speech. Every word surprised his followers; every stroke\r\nstrengthened his position. He did not speak often, but he always\r\nanswered Seymour, presenting a fine and sustained example of debate,\r\nkeeping within strict rules of combat, and preserving a rational and\r\nargumentative tone, yet emphasising the differences between Hunker and\r\nRadical. Young could not be called brilliant, nor did he have the\r\ncapacity or finish of Seymour as an orator; but he formed his own\r\nopinions, usually with great sagacity, and acted with vigour and skill\r\namid the exasperation produced by the Radical secession. Seward wrote\r\nthat \"he has much practical good sense, and much caution.\" This was\r\nevidenced by the fact that, although only four Radicals voted to\r\nreport Crain's bill, others gradually went over, until finally, on\r\nits passage, only Hunkers voted in the negative. It was a great\r\ntriumph for Young. He had beaten a group of clever managers: he had\r\nweakened the Democratic party by widening the breach between its\r\nfactions; and he had turned the bill recommending a convention into a\r\nWhig measure.\r\n\r\nThe bad news discouraged the senators who dreamed of an abiding union\r\nbetween the two factions; and, although one or two Radicals in the\r\nupper chamber favoured the submission of the amendments separately to\r\nthe people, the friends of the measure obtained two majority against\r\nall attempts to modify it, and four majority on its passage. The\r\nGovernor's approval completed Young's triumph. He had not only\r\nretained his place as an able minority leader against the relentless,\r\ntireless assaults of a Seymour, a Croswell, and a Wright; but, in the\r\npresence of such odds, he had gained the distinction of turning a\r\nminority into a reliable majority in both houses, placing him at once\r\nupon a higher pedestal than is often reached by men of far greater\r\ngenius and eloquence.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the Hunkers to pass a measure appropriating\r\n$197,000 for canal improvement made the situation still more critical.\r\nAlthough the bill devoted the money to completing such unfinished\r\nportions of the Genesee Valley and Black River canals as the\r\ncommissioners approved, it was clearly in violation of the spirit of\r\nthe act of 1842 upon which Hunker and Radical had agreed to bury their\r\ndifferences, and the latter resented its introduction as an\r\ninexcusable affront; but John Young now led his Whig followers to the\r\ncamp of the Hunkers, and, in a few days, the measure lay upon the\r\nGovernor's table for his approval or veto.\r\n\r\nThus far, Governor Wright had been a disappointment to his party.\r\nComplaints from Radicals were heard before his inauguration. They\r\nresented his acceptance of a Hunker's hospitality, asserting that he\r\nshould have made his home at a public house where Hunker and Radical\r\nalike could freely counsel with him; they complained of his\r\nresignation as United States senator, insisting that he ought to have\r\nheld the office until his inauguration as governor and thus prevented\r\nBouck appointing a Hunker as his successor; they denounced his\r\nindifference in the speakership contest; and they murmured at his\r\nopposition to a constitutional convention. There was cause for some of\r\nthese lamentations. It was plain that the Governor was neither a\r\nleader nor a conciliator. A little tact would have held the Radicals\r\nin line against a constitutional convention and kept inviolate the act\r\nof 1842, but he either did not possess or disclaimed the arts and\r\ndiplomacies of a political manager. He could grapple with principles\r\nin the United States Senate and follow them to their logical end, but\r\nhe could not see into the realities of things as clearly as Seymour,\r\nor estimate, with the same accuracy, the relative strength of\r\nconflicting tendencies in the political world. Writers of that day\r\nexpress amazement at the course of Silas Wright in vetoing the canal\r\nappropriation, some of them regarding him as a sort of political\r\npuzzle, others attributing his action to the advice of false friends;\r\nbut his adherence to principle more easily explains it. Seymour knew\r\nthat the \"up-state\" voters, who would probably hold the balance of\r\npower in the next election, wanted the canal finished and would resent\r\nits defeat. Wright, on the other hand, believed in a suspension of\r\npublic works until the debt of the State was brought within the safe\r\ncontrol of its revenues, and in the things he stood for, he was as\r\nunyielding as flint.\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature adjourned Hunkers and Radicals were too wide\r\napart even to unite in the usual address to constituents; and in the\r\nfall campaign of 1845, the party fell back upon the old issues of the\r\nyear before. To the astonishment of the Hunkers, however, the\r\nlegislative session opened in January, 1846, with two Radicals to one\r\nConservative. It looked to the uninitiated as if the policy of canal\r\nimprovement had fallen into disfavour; but Croswell, and other Hunkers\r\nin the inner political circle, understood that a change, long foreseen\r\nby them, was rapidly approaching. The people of New York felt profound\r\ninterest in the conflict between slavery and freedom, and the\r\nfearless stand of Preston King of St. Lawrence in supporting the\r\nWilmot Proviso, excluding \"slavery and involuntary servitude\" from the\r\nterritory obtained from Mexico, had added fuel to the flame. King was\r\na Radical from principle and from prejudice. For four successive years\r\nhe had been in the Assembly, hostile to canals and opposed to all\r\nimprovements. In his bitterness he denounced the Whig party as the old\r\nFederalist party under another name. He was now, at the age of forty,\r\nserving his second term in Congress. But, obstinate and uncompromising\r\nas was his Democracy, the aggressive spirit and encroaching designs of\r\nslavery had so deeply disturbed him that he refused to go with his\r\nparty in its avowed purpose of extending slavery into free or newly\r\nacquired territory.\r\n\r\nTo the Hunkers, this new departure seemed to offer an opportunity of\r\nweakening the Radicals by forcing them into opposition to the Polk\r\nadministration; and a resolution, approving the course of the New York\r\ncongressmen who had supported the annexation of Texas, appeared in the\r\nSenate soon after its organisation. Very naturally, politicians were\r\nafraid of it; and the debate, which quickly degenerated into bitter\r\npersonalities, indicated that the Free-soil sentiment, soon to inspire\r\nthe new Republican party, had not only taken root among the Radicals,\r\nbut that rivalries between the two factions rested on differences of\r\nprinciple far deeper than canal improvement. \"If you study the papers\r\nat all,\" wrote William H. Seward, \"you will see that the Barnburners\r\nof this State have carried the war into Africa, and the extraordinary\r\nspectacle is exhibited of Democrats making up an issue of slavery at\r\nWashington. The consequences of this movement cannot be fully\r\napprehended. It brings on the great question sooner and more directly\r\nthan we have even hoped. All questions of revenue, currency, and\r\neconomy sink before it. The hour for the discussion of emancipation is\r\nnearer at hand, by many years, than has been supposed.\"[354]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 33.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION\r\n\r\n1846\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constitutional convention, called by the Legislature of 1845,\r\nreceived popular sanction at the fall elections; and, in April, 1846,\r\none hundred and twenty-eight delegates were chosen. The convention\r\nassembled on the first day of June, and terminated its labours on the\r\nninth day of October. It was an able body of men. It did not contain,\r\nperhaps, so many distinguished citizens as its predecessor in 1821,\r\nbut, like the convention of a quarter of a century before, it included\r\nmany men who had acquired reputations for great ability at the bar and\r\nin public affairs during the two decades immediately preceding it.\r\nAmong the more prominent were Michael Hoffman of Herkimer, famous for\r\nhis influence in the cause of canal economy; James Tallmadge of\r\nDutchess, whose inspiring eloquence had captivated conventions and\r\nlegislatures for thirty years; William C. Bouck of Schoharie, the\r\nunconquered Hunker who had faced defeat as gracefully as he had\r\naccepted gubernatorial honours; Samuel Nelson, recently appointed to\r\nthe United States Supreme Court after an experience of twenty-two\r\nyears upon the circuit and supreme bench of the State; Charles S.\r\nKirkland and Ezekiel Bacon of Oneida, the powerful leaders of a bar\r\nfamous in that day for its famous lawyers; Churchill C. Cambreling of\r\nNew York, a member of Congress for eighteen consecutive years, and,\r\nmore recently, minister to Russia; George W. Patterson of Livingston,\r\na constant, untiring and enthusiastic Whig champion, twice elected\r\nspeaker of the Assembly and soon to become lieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\nOf the younger delegates, three were just at the threshold of their\r\nbrilliant and distinguished careers. John K. Porter of Saratoga--then\r\nonly twenty-seven years old, afterward to become a member of the Court\r\nof Appeals and the associate of William M. Evarts as counsel for Henry\r\nWard Beecher in the Tilton suit--discussed the judiciary in speeches\r\nsingularly adapted to reach the understanding of the delegates; Samuel\r\nJ. Tilden, who had served respectably but without distinction in the\r\nAssembly of 1845 and 1846, evidenced his inflexible courage and high\r\nintellectual qualities; and Charles O'Conor, already known to the\r\npublic, gave signal proof of the prodigious extent of those powers and\r\nacquirements which finally entitled him to rank with the greatest\r\nlawyers of any nation or any time.\r\n\r\nOf the more distinguished members of the convention of 1821, James\r\nTallmadge alone sat in the convention of 1846. Daniel D. Tompkins,\r\nRufus King, William W. Van Ness, Jonas Platt, and Abraham Van Vechten\r\nwere dead; James Kent, now in his eighty-third year, was delivering\r\nlaw lectures in New York City; Ambrose Spencer, having served as\r\nchairman of the Whig national convention at Baltimore, in 1844, had\r\nreturned, at the age of eighty-one, to the quiet of his agricultural\r\npursuits in the vicinity of Lyons; Martin Van Buren, still rebellious\r\nagainst his party, was watching from his retreat at Lindenwald the\r\nstrife over the Wilmot Proviso, embodying the opposition to the\r\nextension of slavery into new territories; Erastus Root, at the age of\r\nseventy-four, was dying in New York City; and Samuel Young, famous by\r\nhis knightly service in the cause of the Radicals, had just finished\r\nin the Assembly, with the acerbity of temper that characterised his\r\ngreatest oratorical efforts during nearly half a century of public\r\nlife, an eloquent indictment of the Hunkers, whom he charged with\r\nbeing the friends of monopoly, the advocates of profuse and\r\nunnecessary expenditures of the public funds, and the cause of much\r\ncorrupt legislation.\r\n\r\nBut of all men in the State the absence of William H. Seward was the\r\nmost noticeable. For four years, as governor, he had stood for\r\ninternal improvements, for the reorganisation of the judiciary along\r\nlines of progress, for diminishing official patronage, for modifying,\r\nand ultimately doing away with, feudal tenures, and for free schools\r\nand universal suffrage. His experience and ability would have been\r\nmost helpful in the formation of the new constitution; but he would\r\nnot become a delegate except from Auburn, and a majority of the people\r\nof his own assembly district did not want him. \"The world are all mad\r\nwith me here,\" he wrote Weed, \"because I defended Wyatt too\r\nfaithfully. God help them to a better morality. The prejudices against\r\nme grows by reason of the Van Nest murder!\"[355] Political friends\r\noffered him a nomination and election from Chautauqua, but he\r\ndeclined, urging as a further reason that the Whigs would be in the\r\nminority, and his presence might stimulate fresh discords among them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 791.]\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley had expected a nomination from Chautauqua. He had\r\nrelations who promised him support, and with their failure to elect\r\nhim began that yearning for office which was destined to doom him to\r\nmany bitter disappointments. Until now, he had kept his desires to\r\nhimself. He wanted to be postmaster of New York in 1841; and, when\r\nSeward failed to anticipate his ambition, he recalled the scriptural\r\ninjunction, \"Ask, and it shall be given you.\" So, he conferred with\r\nWeed about the constitutional convention. Washington County was\r\nsuggested, then Delaware, and later Albany; but, the nominees having\r\nbeen selected, the project was abandoned, and Horace Greeley waited\r\nuntil the convention of 1867. Weed expressed the belief that if\r\nGreeley's wishes had been known two weeks earlier, his ambition might\r\nhave been gratified, although on only two occasions had non-resident\r\ndelegates ever been selected.\r\n\r\nPopular sovereignty attained its highest phase under the Constitution\r\nof 1846; and the convention must always be notable as the great\r\ndividing line between a government by the people, and a government\r\ndelegated by the people to certain officials--executive, legislative,\r\nand judicial--who were invested with general and more or less\r\npermanent powers. Under the Constitution of 1821, the power of\r\nappointment was placed in the governor, the Senate, and the Assembly.\r\nState officers were elected by the Legislature, judges nominated by\r\nthe governor and confirmed by the Senate, district attorneys appointed\r\nby county courts, justices of the peace chosen by boards of\r\nsupervisors, and mayors of cities selected by the common council.\r\nLater amendments made justices of the peace and mayors of cities\r\nelective; but, with these exceptions, from 1821 to 1846 the\r\nConstitution underwent no organic changes. Under the Constitution of\r\n1846, however, all officers became elective; and, to bring them still\r\nnearer the people, an elective judiciary was decentralised, terms of\r\nsenators were reduced from four to two years, and the selection of\r\nlegislators was confined to single districts. It was also provided\r\nthat amendments to the Constitution might be submitted to the people\r\nat any time upon the approval of a bare legislative majority. Even the\r\noffice of governor, which had been jealously reserved to native\r\ncitizens, was thrown open to all comers, whether born in the United\r\nStates or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs if to accentuate the great change which public sentiment had\r\nundergone in the preceding twenty years these provisions were\r\ngenerally concurred in by large majorities and without political bias.\r\nThe proposition that a governor need not be either a freeholder or a\r\nnative citizen was sustained by a vote of sixty-one to forty-nine; the\r\nproposal to overcome the governor's veto by a majority instead of a\r\ntwo-thirds vote was carried by sixty-one to thirty-six; the term of\r\nsenators was reduced from four to two years by a vote of eighty to\r\ntwenty-three; and their selection confined to single districts by a\r\nmajority of seventy-nine to thirty-one. An equally large majority\r\nfavoured the provision that no member of the Legislature should\r\nreceive from the governor or Legislature any civil appointment within\r\nthe State, or to the United States Senate. Charles O'Conor antagonised\r\nthe inhibition of an election to the United States Senate with much\r\nlearning and eloquence. He thought the power of the State to qualify\r\nor restrict the choice of senators was inconsistent with the Federal\r\nConstitution; but the great majority of the convention held otherwise.\r\nIndeed, so popular did this section become that, in 1874, members of\r\nthe Legislature were prohibited from taking office under a city\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe period when property measured a man's capacity and influence also\r\nseems to have passed away with the adoption of the Constitution of\r\n1846. For the first time in the State's history, the great landholders\r\nlost control, and provisions as to the land law became clear and\r\nwholesome. Feudal tenures were abolished, lands declared allodial,\r\nfines and quarter sales made void, and leases of agricultural lands\r\nfor longer than twelve years pronounced illegal. Although vested\r\nrights could not be affected, the policy of the new constitutional\r\nconditions, aided by the accessibility of better and cheaper lands\r\nalong lines of improved transportation, compelled landlords in the\r\nolder parts of the State to seek compromises and to offer greater\r\ninducements. The only persons required to own property in order to\r\nenjoy suffrage and the right to hold office were negroes, who\r\ncontinued to rest under the ban until the adoption of the fifteenth\r\namendment to the Federal Constitution. The people of New York felt\r\nprofound interest in the great conflict between slavery and freedom,\r\nbut, for more than a quarter of a century after the Wilmot Proviso\r\nbecame the shibboleth of the Barnburners, a majority of voters denied\r\nthe coloured man equality of suffrage. Among the thirty-two delegates\r\nin the convention of 1846 who refused to allow the people to pass upon\r\nthe question of equality of suffrage, appear the names of Charles\r\nO'Conor and Samuel J. Tilden.\r\n\r\nThe great purpose of the convention was the reform of the laws\r\nrelating to debt and to the creation of a new judicial establishment.\r\nMichael Hoffman headed the committee charged with the solution of\r\nfinancial problems. He saw the importance of devoting the resources of\r\nthe State to the reduction of its debt. It was important to the\r\ncharacter of the people, he thought, that they should be restless and\r\nimpatient under the obligation of debt; and the strong ground taken by\r\nhim against an enlargement of the Erie and its lateral canals had\r\nresulted in the passage of the famous act of 1842, the substance of\r\nwhich he now desired incorporated into the Constitution. He would\r\nneither tolerate compromises with debtors of the State, nor allow its\r\ncredit to be loaned. He favoured sinking funds, he advocated direct\r\ntaxation, he insisted upon the strictest observance of appropriation\r\nlaws, and he opposed the sale of the canals. In his speeches he\r\nprobably exaggerated the canal debt, just as he minimised the canal\r\nincome and brushed aside salt and auction duties as of little\r\nimportance; yet everybody recognised him as the schoolmaster of the\r\nconvention on financial subjects. His blackboard shone in the\r\nsunlight. He was courteous, but without much deference. There was\r\nneither yielding nor timidity. If his flint struck a spark by\r\ncollision with another, it made little difference to him. Yet years\r\nafterward, Thurlow Weed, who backed Seward in his appeal for more\r\nextensive internal improvements, admitted that to Hoffman's\r\nenlightened statesmanship, New York was indebted for the financial\r\narticle in the Constitution of 1846, which had preserved the public\r\ncredit and the public faith through every financial crisis.[356]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 356: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 34.]\r\n\r\nHoffman placed the state debt, with interest which must be paid up to\r\nthe time of its extinguishment, at thirty-eight million dollars. Out\r\nof the canal revenues he wanted $1,500,000 paid yearly upon the canal\r\ndebt; $672,000 set apart for the use of the State; and the balance\r\napplied to the improvement of the Erie canal, whenever the surplus\r\namounted to $2,500,000. Further to conserve the interests of the\r\nCommonwealth, he insisted that its credit should not be loaned; that\r\nits borrowed money should not exceed one million dollars, except to\r\nrepel invasion or suppress insurrection; and that no debt should be\r\ncreated without laying a direct annual tax sufficient to pay\r\nprincipal and interest in eighteen years. The result showed that, in\r\nspite of vigorous opposition, he got all he demanded. Some of the\r\namounts were reduced; others slightly diverted; and the remaining\r\nsurplus of the canal revenues, instead of accumulating until it\r\naggregated $2,500,000, was applied each year to the enlargement of the\r\nErie canal and the completion of the Genesee Valley and Black River\r\ncanals; but his plan was practically adopted and time has amply\r\njustified the wisdom of his limitations. In concluding his last\r\nspeech, the distinguished Radical declared \"that this legislation\r\nwould not only preserve the credit of New York by keeping its debts\r\npaid, but it would cause every State in the Union, as soon as such\r\nStates were able to do so, to sponge out its debts by payment and thus\r\nremove from representative government the reproaches cast upon us on\r\nthe other side of the water.\"[357]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 655.]\r\n\r\nBut Hoffman, while exciting the admiration of all men for his\r\npersistence, dexterity, and ability, did not lead the most important\r\ncontest. In 1846, the popular desire for radical changes in the\r\njudiciary was not less peremptory than the expression in 1821. Up to\r\nthis time, the courts of the State, in part, antedated the War of\r\nIndependence. Now, in place of the ancient appointive system, the\r\npeople demanded an elective judiciary which should be responsible to\r\nthem and bring the courts to them. To make these changes, the\r\npresident of the convention appointed a committee of thirteen, headed\r\nby Charles H. Ruggles of Dutchess, which embraced the lawyers of most\r\neminence among the delegates. After the chairman came Charles O'Conor\r\nof New York, Charles P. Kirkland of Utica, Ambrose L. Jordan of\r\nColumbia, Arphaxed Loomis of Herkimer, Alvah Worden of Saratoga,\r\nGeorge W. Patterson of Livingston, and several others of lesser note.\r\nAt the end of the committee appeared a merchant and a farmer, possibly\r\nfor the reason that condiments make a dish more savoury. Ruggles was a\r\nsimple-hearted and wise man. He had been on the Supreme bench for\r\nfifteen years, becoming one of the distinguished jurists of the State.\r\nIn the fierce conflicts between Clintonians and Bucktails he acted\r\nwith the former, and then, in 1828, followed DeWitt Clinton to the\r\nsupport of Andrew Jackson. But Ruggles never offended anybody. His\r\nwise and moderate counsel had drawn the fire from many a wild and\r\ndangerous scheme, but it left no scars. Prudence and modesty had\r\ncharacterised his life, and his selection as chairman of the judiciary\r\ncommittee disarmed envy and jealousy. He was understood to favour an\r\nelective judiciary and moderation in all doubtful reforms. Arphaxed\r\nLoomis possessed unusual abilities as a public speaker, and, during a\r\nbrief career in the Assembly, had become known as an advocate of legal\r\nreform. He was afterward, in April, 1847, appointed a commissioner on\r\npractice and pleadings for the purpose of providing a uniform course\r\nof proceedings in all cases; and, to him, perhaps, more than to any\r\none else, is due the credit of establishing one form of action for the\r\nprotection of private rights and the redress of private wrongs. Worden\r\nhad been a merchant, who, losing his entire possessions by failure,\r\nbegan the study of law at the age of thirty-four and quickly took a\r\nprominent place among the lawyers of the State. Ambrose L. Jordan,\r\nalthough somewhat younger than Benjamin F. Butler, Thomas Oakley,\r\nHenry R. Storrs, and other former leaders of the bar, was their\r\nsuccessful opponent, and had gained the distinction of winning the\r\nfirst breach of promise suit in which a woman figured as defendant.\r\nPatterson had rare and exquisite gifts which made him many friends and\r\nkept him for half a century prominent in political affairs. Though of\r\nundoubted intellectual power, clear-sighted, and positive, he rarely\r\nanswered other men's arguments, and never with warmth or heat. But he\r\nhad, however, read and mastered the law, and his voice was helpful in\r\nconferring upon the people a system which broke the yoke of the former\r\ncolonial subordination.\r\n\r\nThe majority report of the judiciary committee provided for a new\r\ncourt of last resort, to be called the Court of Appeals, which was to\r\nconsist of eight members, four of whom were to be elected from the\r\nState at large for a term of eight years, and four to be chosen from\r\nthe justices of the Supreme Court. A new Supreme Court of thirty-two\r\nmembers, having general and original jurisdiction in law and equity,\r\nwas established in place of the old Supreme Court and Court of\r\nChancery, the State being divided into eight districts, in each of\r\nwhich four judges were to be elected. In addition to these great\r\ncourts, inferior local tribunals of civil and criminal jurisdiction\r\nwere provided for cities. The report thus favoured three radical\r\nchanges. Judges became elective, courts of law and equity were united,\r\nand county courts were abolished. The inclusion of senators in the old\r\nCourt of Errors--which existed from the foundation of the State--had\r\nmade the elective system somewhat familiar to the people, to whom it\r\nhad proved more satisfactory than the method of appointment; but the\r\nunion of courts of law and equity was an untried experiment in New\r\nYork. It had the sanction of other States, and, in part, of the\r\njudicial system of the United States, where procedure at law and in\r\nequity had become assimilated, if not entirely blended, thus\r\nabolishing the inconvenience of so many tribunals and affording\r\ngreater facility for the trial of equity causes involving questions of\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nBut delegates were slow to profit by the experience of other\r\nCommonwealths. From the moment the report was submitted attacks upon\r\nit became bitter and continuous. Charles O'Conor opposed the elective\r\nsystem, the union of the two courts, and the abolition of the county\r\ncourt. Charles P. Kirkland proposed that only three members of the\r\nCourt of Appeals be elected, the others to be appointed by the\r\ngovernor, with the consent of the Senate. Alvah Worden wanted two\r\nCourts of Appeals, one of law and one of chancery, neither of which\r\nshould be elective. Simmons desired a different organisation of the\r\nSupreme Court, and Bascom objected to the insufficient number of\r\nsessions of the court provided for the whole State. Others of the\r\nminority submitted reports and opinions, until the subject seemed\r\nhopelessly befogged and the work of the majority a failure. O'Conor\r\nwas especially impatient and restless in his opposition. In skill and\r\nability no one could vie with him in making the old ways seem better.\r\nHe was now forty-two years old. He had a powerful and vigorous frame,\r\nand a powerful and vigorous understanding. It was the wonder of his\r\ncolleagues how, in addition to the faithful work performed in\r\ncommittee, he could get time for the research that was needed to equip\r\nhim for the great speeches with which he adorned the debates. He never\r\nheld office, save, during a portion of President Pierce's\r\nadministration, that of United States attorney for the southern\r\ndistrict of New York; but his rapid, almost instinctive judgment, his\r\ntact, his ability to crush sophistries with a single sentence, and his\r\nvigorous rhetoric must have greatly distinguished his administration\r\nof any office which he might have occupied. Yet the conservatism which\r\nfinally separated him from the cordial supporters of the government\r\nduring the Civil War usually kept him in the minority. His spirit was\r\nnot the spirit that governed; and, in spite of his brilliant and\r\ndetermined opposition, the convention of 1846 accepted the elective\r\nsystem, approved the union of equity and law courts, prohibited the\r\nelection of a member of the Legislature to the United States Senate,\r\nand submitted to the decision of the people the right of coloured men\r\nto equal suffrage. Only in the retention of the county court were\r\nO'Conor's views sustained; and this came largely through the influence\r\nof Arphaxed Loomis, the material part of whose amendment was\r\nultimately adopted. When, finally, the Constitution in its entirety\r\nwas submitted to the convention for its approval, O'Conor was one of\r\nsix to vote against it.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1846 was the people's Constitution. It reserved to\r\nthem the right to act more frequently upon a large class of questions,\r\nintroducing the referendum which characterises popular government,\r\nand making it a more perfect expression of the popular will. That the\r\npeople appreciated the greater power reserved to them was shown on the\r\nthird of November, by a vote of 221,528 to 92,436. With few\r\nmodifications, the Constitution of 1846 still remains in force,--ample\r\nproof that wisdom, unalloyed with partisan politics or blind\r\nconservatism, guided the convention which framed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDEFEAT AND DEATH OF SILAS WRIGHT\r\n\r\n1846-1847\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Democratic campaign for governor in 1846 opened with extraordinary\r\ninterest. Before the Legislature adjourned, on May 13, the Hunkers\r\nrefused to attend a party caucus for the preparation of the usual\r\naddress. Subsequently, however, they issued one of their own, charging\r\nthe Radicals with hostility to the Polk administration and with\r\nselfishness, born of a desire to control every office within the gift\r\nof the canal board. The address did not, in terms, name Silas Wright,\r\nbut the Governor was not blind to its attacks. \"They are not very\r\ndifferent from what I expected when I consented to take this office,\"\r\nhe wrote a friend in Canton. \"I do not yet think it positively certain\r\nthat we shall lose the convention, but that its action and the\r\nelection are to produce a perfect separation of a portion of our party\r\nfrom the main body I cannot any longer entertain a single doubt. You\r\nmust not permit appearances to deceive you. Although I am not\r\ndenounced here by name with others, the disposition to do that, if\r\npolicy would permit, is not even disguised, and every man known to be\r\nstrongly my friend and firmly in my confidence is more bitterly\r\ndenounced than any other.\"[358]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 756. _Appendix._]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if Silas Wright himself fully comprehended the real\r\nreason for such bitterness. He was a natural gentleman, kindly and\r\ntrue. He might sometimes err in judgment; but he was essentially a\r\nstatesman of large and comprehensive vision, incapable of any meanness\r\nor conscious wrong-doing. The masses of the party regarded him as the\r\nrepresentative of the opportunity which a great State, in a republic,\r\nholds out to the children of its humblest and poorest citizens. He was\r\nas free from guile as a little child. To him principle and party stood\r\nbefore all other things; and he could not be untrue to one any more\r\nthan to the other. But the leaders of the Hunker wing did not take\r\nkindly to him. They could not forget that the Radical state officers,\r\nwith whom he coincided in principle, in conjuring with his name in\r\n1844 had defeated the renomination of Governor Bouck; and, though they\r\nmight admit that his nomination practically elected Polk, by\r\nextracting the party from the mire of Texas annexation, they\r\npreferred, deep in their hearts, a Whig governor to his continuance in\r\noffice, since his influence with the people for high ends was not in\r\naccord with their purposes. For more than a decade these men, as\r\nSamuel Young charged in his closing speech in the Assembly of that\r\nyear, had been after the flesh-pots. They favoured the banking\r\nmonopoly, preferring special charters that could be sold to free\r\nfranchises under a general law; they influenced the creation of state\r\nstocks in which they profited; they owned lands which would appreciate\r\nby the construction of canals and railroads. To all these selfish\r\ninterests, the Governor's restrictive policy was opposed; and while\r\nthey did not dare denounce him by name, as the Governor suggested in\r\nhis letter, their tactics increased the hostility that was eventually\r\nto destroy him.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, however, that the representation of Hunkers at\r\nthe Democratic state convention, held at Syracuse on October 1, did\r\nnot indicate much popular strength. The Radicals outnumbered them two\r\nto one. On the first ballot Silas Wright received one hundred and\r\ntwelve votes out of one hundred and twenty-five, and, upon motion of\r\nHoratio Seymour, the nomination became unanimous. For lieutenant-governor,\r\nAddison Gardiner was renominated by acclamation. The convention then\r\nclosed its labours with the adoption of a platform approving the\r\nre-enactment of the independent treasury law, the passage of the\r\nWalker tariff act, and the work of the constitutional convention,\r\nwith an expression of hope that the Mexican War, which had commenced\r\non the 12th of the preceding May, might be speedily and honourably\r\nterminated. The address concluded with a just eulogy of Silas Wright.\r\nAt the moment, the contest seemed at an end; but the sequel showed it\r\nwas only a surface settlement.\r\n\r\nIf Democrats were involved in a quarrel, the Whigs were scarcely a\r\nhappy family. It is not easy to pierce the fog which shrouds the\r\ndivision of the party; but it is clear that when Seward became\r\ngovernor and Weed dictator, trouble began in respect to men and to\r\nmeasures. Though less marked, possibly, than the differences between\r\nDemocratic factions, the discord seemed to increase with the\r\nhopelessness of Whig ascendancy. Undoubtedly it began with Seward's\r\nrecommendation of separate schools for the children of foreigners, and\r\nin his pronounced anti-slavery views; but it had also festered and\r\nexpanded from disappointments, and from Weed's opposition to Henry\r\nClay in 1836 and 1840. Even Horace Greeley, already consumed with a\r\ndesire for public preferment, began to chafe under the domineering\r\ninfluence of Weed and the supposed neglect of Seward; while Millard\r\nFillmore, and those acting with him, although retaining personal\r\nrelations with Weed, were ready to break away at the first\r\nopportunity. As the Whigs had been in the minority for several years,\r\nthe seriousness of these differences did not become public knowledge;\r\nbut the newspapers divided the party into Radicals and Conservatives,\r\nthe former being represented by the _Evening Journal_ and the\r\n_Tribune_, the latter by the New York _Courier and Enquirer_ and the\r\nBuffalo _Commercial Advertiser_.\r\n\r\nThis division, naturally, led to some difference of opinion about a\r\ncandidate for governor; and, when the Whig state convention met at\r\nUtica on September 23, an informal ballot developed fifty-five votes\r\nfor Millard Fillmore, thirty-six for John Young, and twenty-one for\r\nIra Harris, with eight or ten scattering. Fillmore had not sought the\r\nnomination. Indeed, there is evidence that he protested against the\r\npresentation of his name; but his vote represented the conservative\r\nWhigs who did not take kindly either to Young or to Harris. Ira\r\nHarris, who was destined to bear a great part in a great history, had\r\njust entered his forty-fourth year. He was graduated from Union\r\nCollege with the highest honours, studied law with Ambrose Spencer,\r\nand slowly pushed himself into the front rank of practitioners at the\r\nAlbany bar. In 1844, while absent in the West, the Anti-Renters\r\nnominated him, without his knowledge, for the Assembly, and, with the\r\nhelp of the Whigs, elected him. He had in no wise identified himself\r\nwith active politics or with anti-rent associations; but the people\r\nhonoured him for his integrity as well as for his fearless support of\r\nthe principle of individual rights. In the Assembly he demonstrated\r\nthe wisdom of their choice, evidencing distinguished ability and\r\npolitical tact. In 1845 the same people returned him to the Assembly.\r\nThen, in the following year, they sent him to the constitutional\r\nconvention; and, some months later, to the State Senate. Beneath his\r\nplain courtesy was great firmness. He could not be otherwise than the\r\nconstant friend of everything which made for the emancipation and\r\nelevation of the individual. His advocacy of an elective judiciary,\r\nthe union of law and equity, and the simplification of pleadings and\r\npractice in the courts, showed that there were few stronger or clearer\r\nintellects in the constitutional convention. With good reason,\r\ntherefore, the constituency that sent him there favoured him for\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nBut John Young shone as the popular man of the hour. Young was a\r\nmiddle-of-the-road Whig, whose candidacy grew out of his recent\r\nlegislative record. He had forced the passage of the bill calling a\r\nconstitutional convention, and had secured the canal appropriation\r\nwhich the Governor deemed it wise to veto. In the Assembly of 1845 and\r\n1846, he became his party's choice for speaker; and, though not a man\r\nof refinement or scholarly attainments, or one, perhaps, whose wisdom\r\nand prudence could safely be relied upon under the stress of great\r\nresponsibilities, he was just then the chief figure of the State and\r\nof great influence with the people--especially with the Anti-Renters\r\nand their sympathisers, whose strife and turbulence in Columbia and\r\nDelaware counties had been summarily suppressed by Governor Wright.\r\nThe older leaders of his party thought him somewhat of a demagogue;\r\nThurlow Weed left the convention in disgust when he discovered that a\r\npre-arranged transfer of the Harris votes would nominate him. But,\r\nwith the avowed friendship of Ira Harris, Young was stronger at this\r\ntime than Weed, and on the third ballot he received seventy-six votes\r\nto forty-five for Fillmore. To balance the ticket, Hamilton Fish\r\nbecame the candidate for lieutenant-governor. Fish represented the\r\neastern end of the State, the conservative wing of the party, and New\r\nYork City, where he was deservedly popular.\r\n\r\nThere were other parties in the field. The Abolitionists made\r\nnominations, and the Native Americans put up Ogden Edwards, a Whig of\r\nsome prominence, who had served in the Assembly, in the constitutional\r\nconvention of 1821, and upon the Supreme bench. But it was the action\r\nof the Anti-Renters, or national reformers as they were called, that\r\nmost seriously embarrassed the Whigs and the Democrats. The\r\nAnti-Renters could scarcely be called a party, although they had grown\r\ninto a political organisation which held the balance of power in\r\nseveral counties. Unlike the Abolitionists, however, they wanted\r\nimmediate results rather than sacrifices for principle, and their\r\nsupport was deemed important if not absolutely conclusive. When the\r\nlittle convention of less than thirty delegates met at Albany in\r\nOctober, therefore, their ears listened for bids. They sought a pardon\r\nfor the men convicted in 1845 for murderous outrages perpetrated in\r\nDelaware and Schoharie; and, although unsupported by proof, it was\r\nafterward charged and never denied, that, either at the time of their\r\nconvention or subsequently before the election, Ira Harris produced a\r\nletter from John Young in which the latter promised executive clemency\r\nin the event of his election. However this may be, it is not unlikely\r\nthat Harris' relations with the Anti-Renters aided materially in\r\nsecuring Young's indorsement, and it is a matter of record that soon\r\nafter Young's inauguration the murderers were pardoned, the Governor\r\njustifying his action upon the ground that their offences were\r\npolitical. The democratic Anti-Renters urged Silas Wright to give some\r\nassurances that he, too, would issue a pardon; but the Cato of his\r\nparty, who never caressed or cajoled his political antagonists,\r\ndeclined to give any intimation upon the subject. Thereupon, as if to\r\nemphasise their dislike of Wright, the Anti-Rent delegates indorsed\r\nJohn Young for governor and Addison Gardiner for lieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the campaign William C. Bouck received the federal\r\nappointment of sub-treasurer in New York, under the act\r\nre-establishing the independent treasury system. This office was one\r\nof the most important in the gift of the President, and, because the\r\nappointee was the recognised head of the Hunkers, the impression\r\nimmediately obtained that the government at Washington disapproved the\r\nre-election of Silas Wright. It became the sensation of the hour. Many\r\nbelieved the success of the Governor would make him a formidable\r\ncandidate for President in 1848, and the impropriety of Polk's action\r\noccasioned much adverse criticism. The President and several members\r\nof his Cabinet privately assured the Governor of their warmest\r\nfriendship, but, as one member of the radical wing expressed it,\r\n\"Bouck's appointment became a significant indication of the guillotine\r\nprepared for Governor Wright in November.\"\r\n\r\nOther causes than the Democratic feud also contributed to the\r\ndiscomfiture of Silas Wright. John Young had made an admirable record\r\nin the Assembly. He had also, at the outbreak of hostilities with\r\nMexico, although formerly opposed to the annexation of Texas, been\r\namong the first to approve the war, declaring that \"Texas was now bone\r\nof our bone, flesh of our flesh, and that since the rights of our\r\ncitizens had been trampled upon, he would sustain the country, right\r\nor wrong.\"[359] It soon became evident, too, that the Anti-Renters were\r\nwarm and persistent friends. His promise to pardon their leaders\r\nreceived the severe condemnation of the conservative Whig papers; but\r\nsuch censure only added to his vote in Anti-Rent counties. In like\r\nmanner, Young's support of the canals and Wright's veto of the\r\nappropriation, strengthened the one and weakened the other in all the\r\ncanal counties. Indeed, after the election it was easy to trace all\r\nthese influences. Oneida, a strong canal county, which had given\r\nWright eight hundred majority in 1844, now gave Young thirteen\r\nhundred. Similar results appeared in Lewis, Alleghany, Herkimer, and\r\nother canal counties. In Albany, an Anti-Rent county, the Whig\r\nmajority of twenty-five was increased to twenty-eight hundred, while\r\nDelaware, another Anti-Rent stronghold, changed Wright's majority of\r\nnine hundred in 1844, to eighteen hundred for Young. On the other\r\nhand, in New York City, where the conservative Whig papers had\r\nbitterly assailed their candidate, Wright's majority of thirty-three\r\nhundred in 1844 was increased to nearly fifty-two hundred. In the\r\nState Young's majority over Wright exceeded eleven thousand,[360] and\r\nGardiner's over Fish was more than thirteen thousand. The\r\nAnti-Renters, who had also indorsed one Whig and one Democratic canal\r\ncommissioner, gave them majorities of seven and thirteen thousand\r\nrespectively. Of eight senators chosen, the Whigs elected five; and of\r\nthe one hundred and twenty-eight assemblymen, sixty-eight, the\r\nminority being made up of fifty Democrats and ten Anti-Renters. The\r\nWhig returns also included twenty-three out of thirty-four\r\ncongressmen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 359: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 762.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 360: John Young, 198,878; Silas Wright, 187,306; Henry\r\nBradley, 12,844; Ogden Edwards, 6306.--_Civil List, State of New York_\r\n(1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nIt was a sweeping victory--one of the sporadic kind that occur in\r\nmoments of political unrest when certain classes are in rebellion\r\nagainst some phase of existing conditions. Seward, who happened to be\r\nin Albany over Sunday, pictured the situation in one of his racy\r\nletters. \"To-day,\" he says, \"I have been at St. Peter's and heard one\r\nof those excellent discourses of Dr. Potter. There was such a jumble\r\nof wrecks of party in the church that I forgot the sermon and fell to\r\nmoralising on the vanity of political life. You know my seat. Well,\r\nhalfway down the west aisle sat Silas Wright, wrapped in a coat\r\ntightly buttoned to the chin, looking philosophy, which it is hard to\r\naffect and harder to attain. On the east side sat Daniel D. Barnard,\r\nupon whom 'Anti-Rent' has piled Ossa, while Pelion only has been\r\nrolled upon Wright. In the middle of the church was Croswell, who\r\nseemed to say to Wright, 'You are welcome to the gallows you erected\r\nfor me.' On the opposite side sat John Young, the _saved_ among the\r\nlost politicians. He seemed complacent and satisfied.\"[361]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 361: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 34.]\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Silas Wright caused no real surprise. It seemed to be in\r\nthe air. Everything was against him save his own personal influence,\r\nbased upon his sincerity, integrity, and lofty patriotism. Seward had\r\npredicted the result at the time of Wright's nomination in 1844, and\r\nWright himself had anticipated it. \"I told some friends when I\r\nconsented to take this office,\" he wrote John Fine, his Canton friend,\r\nin March, 1846, \"that it would terminate my public life.\"[362] But the\r\nstory of Silas Wright's administration as governor was not all a\r\nrecord of success. He was opposed to a constitutional convention as\r\nwell as to a canal appropriation, and, by wisely preventing the\r\nformer, it is likely the latter would not have been forced upon him.\r\nWithout a convention bill and a canal veto, the party would not have\r\ndivided seriously, John Young would not have become a popular hero,\r\nand the Anti-Renters could not have held the balance of power. To\r\nprevent the calling of a constitutional convention, therefore, or at\r\nleast to have confined it within limits approved by the Hunkers, was\r\nthe Governor's great opportunity. It would not have been an easy\r\ntask. William C. Crain had a profound conviction on the subject, and\r\nback of him stood Michael Hoffman, the distinguished and unrelenting\r\nRadical, determined to put the act of 1842 into the organic law of the\r\nState. But there was a time when a master of political diplomacy could\r\nhave controlled the situation. Even after permitting Crain's defeat\r\nfor speaker, the appointment of Michael Hoffman to the judgeship\r\nvacated by Samuel Nelson's transfer to the federal bench would have\r\nplaced a powerful lever in the Governor's hand. Hoffman had not sought\r\nthe office, but the appointment would have softened him into a friend,\r\nand with Michael Hoffman as an ally, Crain and his legislative\r\nfollowers could have been controlled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 362: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 756. _Appendix._]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to study the views of Wright's contemporaries as to\r\nthe causes of his defeat.[363] One thought he should have forced the\r\nconvention and veto issues in the campaign of 1845, compelling people\r\nand press to thresh them out a year in advance of his own candidacy;\r\nanother believed if he had vetoed the convention bill a canal\r\nappropriation would not have passed; a third charged him with trusting\r\ntoo much in old friends who misguided him, and too little in new\r\nprinciples that had sprung up while he was absent in the United States\r\nSenate. One writer, apparently the most careful observer, admitted the\r\ninfluence of Anti-Renters and the unpopularity of the canal veto, but\r\ninsisted that the real cause of the Governor's defeat was the\r\nopposition of the Hunkers, \"bound together exclusively by selfish\r\ninterests and seeking only personal advancement and personal\r\ngain.\"[364] This writer named Edwin Croswell as the leader whose wide\r\ninfluence rested like mildew upon the work of the campaign, sapping it\r\nof enthusiasm, and encouraging Democrats among Anti-Renters and those\r\nfavourable to canals to put in the knife on election day. Such a\r\npolicy, of course, it was argued, meant the delivery of Polk from a\r\npowerful opponent in 1848, and the uninterrupted leadership of William\r\nL. Marcy, who now wielded a patronage, greatly increased by the\r\nMexican War, in the interest of the Hunkers and for the defeat of\r\nSilas Wright. If this were not true, continued the writer, William C.\r\nBouck's appointment would have been delayed until after election, and\r\nthe work of postmasters and other government officials, who usually\r\ncontributed generously of their time and means in earnest support of\r\ntheir party, would not have been deadened.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 691.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: _Ibid._, Vol. 3, p. 693.\r\n\r\n\"More serious than either of these [Anti-Rent disturbance and veto of\r\ncanal appropriation] was the harm done by the quiet yet persistent\r\nopposition of the Hunkers. Nor can it be doubted that the influence of\r\nthe Government at Washington was thrown against him in that critical\r\nhour. Governor Marcy was secretary of war; Samuel Nelson had just been\r\nappointed a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States;\r\nGovernor Bouck held one of the most influential offices in the city of\r\nNew York--all these were members of that section of the party with\r\nwhich Governor Wright was not in sympathy. It was evident that he\r\nwould not be able to maintain himself against an opposition of which\r\nthe elements were so numerous, so varied, and so dangerous.\"--Morgan\r\nDix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 1, p. 227.]\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that Governor Wright held similar views. \"I\r\nhave neither time nor disposition to speak of the causes of our\r\noverthrow,\" he wrote, a few days after his defeat was assured. \"The\r\ntime will come when they must be spoken of, and that plainly, but it\r\nwill be a painful duty, and one which I do not want to perform. Our\r\nprinciples are as sound as they ever were, and the hearts of the great\r\nmass of our party will be found as true to them as ever. Hereafter I\r\nthink our enemies will be open enemies, and against such the democracy\r\nhas ever been able, and ever will be able to contend successfully.\"[365]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 757. _Appendix._]\r\n\r\nSilas Wright's defeat in no wise pained him personally. Like John Jay\r\nhe had the habits of seclusion. Manual labour on the farm, his\r\ncorrespondence, and the preparation of an address to be delivered at\r\nthe State Agricultural Fair in September, occupied his leisure during\r\nthe spring and summer of 1847.[366] \"If I were to attempt to tell you\r\nhow happy we make ourselves at our retired home,\" he wrote Governor\r\nFairfield of Maine, \"I fear you would scarcely be able to credit me. I\r\neven yet realise, every day and every hour, the relief from public\r\ncares, and if any thought about temporal affairs could make me more\r\nuneasy than another, it would be the serious one that I was again to\r\ntake upon myself, in any capacity, that ever pressing load.\"[367] This\r\nwas written on the 16th of August, 1847, and on the morning of the\r\n27th his useful life came to an end. The day before he had spoken of\r\napoplexy in connection with the death of a friend, as if he, too, had\r\na premonition of this dread disease. When the end came, the sudden\r\nrush of blood to the head left no doubt of its presence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: \"Nothing can be imagined more admirable than the conduct\r\nof that great man under these trying circumstances. He returned at\r\nonce to his beloved farm at Canton, and resumed, with apparent\r\ndelight, the occupations of a rustic life. Visitors have related how\r\nthey found him at work in his fields, in the midst of his farmhands,\r\nsetting an example of industry and zeal. His house was the shrine of\r\nmany a pilgrimage; and, as profound regret at the loss of such a man\r\nfrom the councils of the State took the place of a less honourable\r\nsentiment, his popularity began to return. Already, as the time for\r\nthe nomination of a President drew near, men were looking to him, as\r\nan illustrious representative of the principles and hereditary faith\r\nof the Democratic-Republican party, in whose hands the country would\r\nbe safe, no matter from what quarter the tempest might come.\"--Morgan\r\nDix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 1, p. 228.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 729.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Silas Wright produced a profound sensation. Since the\r\ndecease of DeWitt Clinton the termination of no public career in the\r\nState caused more real sorrow. Until then, the people scarcely\r\nrealised how much they loved and respected him, and all were quick to\r\nadmit that the history of the Commonwealth furnished few natures\r\nbetter fitted than his, morally and intellectually, for great public\r\ntrusts. Perhaps he cannot be called a man of genius; but he was a man\r\nof commanding ability, with that absolute probity and good sense which\r\nare the safest gifts of a noble character.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of the following December, James Kent died in his\r\neighty-fifth year. He had outlived by eighteen years his contemporary,\r\nJohn Jay; by nearly forty-five years his great contemporary, Alexander\r\nHamilton; and by more than thirty years his distinguished predecessor,\r\nChancellor Livingston. He was the last of the heroic figures that made\r\nfamous the closing quarter of the eighteenth and the opening quarter\r\nof the nineteenth centuries. He could sit at the table of Philip Hone,\r\namidst eminent judges, distinguished statesmen, and men whose names\r\nwere already famous in literature, and talk of the past with personal\r\nknowledge from the time the colony graciously welcomed John Murray,\r\nEarl of Dunmore, as its governor, or threateningly frowned upon\r\nWilliam Howe, viscount and British general, for shutting up its civil\r\ncourts. When, finally, his body was transferred from the sofa in the\r\nlibrary where he had written himself into an immortal fame, to the\r\ncemetery on Second Avenue, the obsequies became the funeral not merely\r\nof a man but of an age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE FREE-SOIL CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n1847-1848\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fearless stand of Preston King in supporting the Wilmot\r\nProviso[368] took root among the Radicals, as Seward prophesied, and\r\nthe exclusion of slavery from territory obtained from Mexico, became\r\nthe dominant Democratic issue in the State. Because of their approval\r\nof this principle the Radicals were called \"Barnburners.\" Originally,\r\nthese factional differences, as noted elsewhere, grew out of the canal\r\ncontroversy in 1838 and in 1841, the Conservatives wishing to devote\r\nthe surplus canal revenues to the completion of the canals--the\r\nRadicals insisting upon their use to pay the state debt. Under this\r\ndivision, Edwin Croswell, William C. Bouck, Daniel S. Dickinson, Henry\r\nA. Foster, and Horatio Seymour led the Conservatives; Michael Hoffman,\r\nJohn A. Dix, and Azariah C. Flagg marshalled the Radicals. When the\r\nConservatives, \"hankering\" after the offices, accepted unconditionally\r\nthe annexation of Texas, they were called Hunkers. In like manner, the\r\nRadicals who sustained the Wilmot Proviso now became Barnburners,\r\nbeing likened to the farmer who burned his barn to get rid of rats.\r\nWilliam L. Marcy, Silas Wright, Benjamin F. Butler, and the Van\r\nBurens took no part in the canal controversy; but after Martin Van\r\nBuren's defeat in 1844 Marcy became a prominent Hunker and entered\r\nPolk's Cabinet, while Wright, Butler, and the Van Burens joined the\r\nBarnburners.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 368: \"To understand the issue presented by the Wilmot Proviso\r\nit must be observed that its advocates sustained it on the distinct\r\nground that, as slavery had been abolished throughout the Mexican\r\nRepublic, the acquisition of territory without prohibiting slavery\r\nwould, on the theory asserted by the Southern States, lead to its\r\nrestoration where it had ceased to exist, and make the United States\r\nresponsible for its extension to districts in which universal freedom\r\nhad been established by the fundamental law.\"--Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of\r\nJohn A. Dix_, Vol. 1, p. 205.]\r\n\r\nHostilities between the Hunkers and Barnburners, growing out of the\r\nslavery question, began at the Democratic state convention, which\r\nconvened at Syracuse, September 7, 1847.[369] Preceding this meeting\r\nboth factions had been active, but the Hunkers, having succeeded in\r\nseating a majority of the delegates, promptly voted down a resolution\r\nembodying the principle of the Wilmot Proviso. Then the Barnburners\r\nseceded. There was no parleying. The breach opened like a chasm and\r\nthe secessionists walked out in a body. This action was followed by an\r\naddress, charging that the anti-slavery resolution had been defeated\r\nby a fraudulent organisation, and calling a mass convention for\r\nOctober 26, \"to avow their principles and consult as to future\r\naction.\" This meeting became a gathering of Martin Van Buren's\r\nfriends. It did not nominate a ticket, which would have defeated the\r\npurpose of the secession; but, by proclaiming the principles of\r\nFree-soil, it struck the keynote of popular sentiment; divided the\r\nDemocratic party, and let the Whigs into power by thirty thousand\r\nmajority. It made Millard Fillmore comptroller, Christopher Morgan\r\nsecretary of state, Alvah Hunt treasurer, Ambrose L. Jordan\r\nattorney-general, and Hamilton Fish lieutenant-governor to fill the\r\nvacancy occasioned by Addison Gardiner's election to the new Court of\r\nAppeals. The president of this seceders' mass-meeting was Churchill C.\r\nCambreling, an old associate of Martin Van Buren, but its leader and\r\ninspiration was John Van Buren. He drafted the address to the people,\r\nhis eloquence made him its chief orator, and his enthusiasm seemed to\r\nendow him with ubiquity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: \"In the fall of 1847 I was a spectator at the Democratic\r\nstate convention, held in Syracuse. The great chiefs of both factions\r\nwere on the ground, and never was there a fiercer, more bitter and\r\nrelentless conflict between the Narragansetts and Pequods than this\r\nmemorable contest between the Barnburners and Hunkers. Silas Wright\r\nwas the idol of the Barnburners. He had died on the 27th of the\r\npreceding August--less than two weeks before. James S. Wadsworth\r\nvoiced the sentiments of his followers. In the convention some one\r\nspoke of doing justice to Mr. Wright. A Hunker sneeringly responded,\r\n'It is too late; he is dead.' Springing upon a table Wadsworth made\r\nthe hall ring as he uttered the defiant reply: 'Though it may be too\r\nlate to do justice to Silas Wright, it is not too late to do justice\r\nto his assassins.' The Hunkers laid the Wilmot Proviso upon the table,\r\nbut the Barnburners punished them at the election.\"--H.B. Stanton,\r\n_Random Recollections_, p. 159.]\r\n\r\nJohn Van Buren was unlike the ordinary son of a President of the\r\nUnited States. He did not rely upon the influence or the prestige of\r\nhis father.[370] He was able to stand alone--a man of remarkable power,\r\nwho became attorney-general in 1845, and for ten years was a marked\r\nfigure in political circles, his bland and convulsing wit enlivening\r\nevery convention and adding interest to every campaign. But his chief\r\ninterest was in his profession. He was a lawyer of great distinction,\r\nthe peer and often the opponent of Charles O'Conor and William H.\r\nSeward. \"He possessed beyond any man I ever knew,\" said Daniel Lord,\r\n\"the power of eloquent, illustrative amplification, united with close,\r\nflexible logic.\"[371]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: \"There could hardly be a wider contrast between two men\r\nthan the space that divided the Sage of Lindenwald from Prince John.\r\nIn one particular, however, they were alike. Each had that personal\r\nmagnetism that binds followers to leaders with hooks of steel. The\r\nfather was grave, urbane, wary, a safe counsellor, and accustomed to\r\nan argumentative and deliberate method of address that befitted the\r\nbar and the Senate. Few knew how able a lawyer the elder Van Buren\r\nwas. The son was enthusiastic, frank, bold, and given to wit,\r\nrepartee, and a style of oratory admirably adapted to swaying popular\r\nassemblies. The younger Van Buren, too, was a sound lawyer.\"--H.B.\r\nStanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 175.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: _History of the Bench and Bar of New York_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n505.]\r\n\r\nJohn Van Buren had, as well, a picturesque side to his life. In\r\ncollege he was expert at billiards, the centre of wit, and the willing\r\ntarget of beauty. Out of college, from the time he danced with the\r\nPrincess Victoria at a court ball in London at the age of twenty-two,\r\nto the end of his interesting and eventful life, he was known as\r\n\"Prince John.\" His remarkable gifts opened the door to all that was\r\nultra as well as noble. He led in the ballroom, he presided at\r\ndinners, he graced every forum, and he moved in the highest social\r\ncircles. Men marvelled at his knowledge, at his unfailing equanimity,\r\nand at his political strength; but even to those who were spellbound\r\nby his eloquence, or captivated by his adroit, skilful conduct of a\r\nlawsuit, he was always \"Prince John.\" There was not a drop of\r\nausterity or intolerance or personal hatred in him. The Dutch blood of\r\nhis father, traced from the Princes of Orange to the days of the New\r\nNetherland patroons, kept him within the limits of moderation if not\r\nentirely unspotted, and his finished manners attracted the common\r\npeople as readily as they charmed the more exclusive.\r\n\r\nJohn Van Buren's acceptance of Free-soilism did not emanate from a\r\ndislike of slavery; nor did Free-soil principles root themselves\r\ndeeply in his nature. His father had opposed the admission of Texas,\r\nand the son, in resentment of his defeat, hoping to make an\r\nanti-slavery party dominant in the State, if not in the nation,\r\nproclaimed his opposition to the extension of slavery. But, after the\r\ncompromise measures of 1850 had temporarily checked the movement, he\r\nfell back into the ranks of the Hunkers, aiding President Pierce's\r\nelection, and sustaining the pro-slavery administration of Buchanan.\r\nIn after years Van Buren frequently explained his connection with the\r\nFree-soil revolt by telling a story of the boy who was vigorously\r\nremoving an overturned load of hay at the roadside. Noticing his wild\r\nand rapid pitching, a passer-by inquired the cause of his haste. The\r\nboy, wiping the perspiration from his brow as he pointed to the pile\r\nof hay, replied, \"Stranger, _dad's under there_!\"\r\n\r\nBut whatever reasons incited John Van Buren to unite with the\r\nFree-soilers, so long as he advocated their principles, he was the\r\nmost brilliant crusader who sought to stay the aggressiveness of\r\nslavery. From the moment he withdrew from the Syracuse convention, in\r\nthe autumn of 1847, until he finally accepted the compromise measures\r\nof 1850, he was looked upon as the hope of the Barnburners and the\r\nmost dangerous foe of the Hunkers. Even Horatio Seymour was afraid of\r\nhim. He did not advocate abolition; he did not treat slavery in the\r\nabstract; he did not transcend the Free-soil doctrine. But he spoke\r\nwith such power and brilliancy that Henry Wilson, afterward Vice\r\nPresident, declared him \"the bright particular star of the\r\nrevolt.\"[372] He was not an impassioned orator. He spoke deliberately,\r\nand rarely with animation or with gesture; and his voice, high pitched\r\nand penetrating, was neither mellow nor melodious. But he was\r\nmarvellously pleasing. His perennial wit kept his audiences expectant,\r\nand his compact, forceful utterances seemed to break the argument of\r\nan opponent as a hammer shatters a pane of glass. So great was his\r\npopularity at this time, that his return to the Democratic party\r\nbecame a personal sorrow to every friend of the anti-slavery cause.\r\n\"Indeed, such was the brilliant record he then made,\" says Henry\r\nWilson, \"that had he remained true to the principles he advocated, he\r\nwould unquestionably have become one of the foremost men of the\r\nRepublican party, if not its accepted leader.\"[373]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: Henry Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power of the\r\nUnited States_, Vol. 2, p. 142.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: _Ibid._, p. 142.]\r\n\r\nSeveral historic conventions followed the secession of the\r\nBarnburners. Each faction held a state convention to select delegates\r\nto the Democratic national convention which met in Baltimore on May\r\n22, 1848, and, on the appointed day, both Hunkers and Barnburners\r\npresented full delegations, each claiming admission to the exclusion\r\nof the other.[374] It was an anxious moment for Democracy. New York\r\nheld the key to the election; without its vote the party could not\r\nhope to win; and without harmony success was impossible. To exclude\r\neither faction, therefore, was political suicide, and, in the end, the\r\nvote was divided equally between them. To the politician, anxious for\r\nparty success and hungry for office, perhaps no other compromise\r\nseemed possible. But the device failed to satisfy either side, and\r\nLewis Cass was nominated for President without the participation of\r\nthe State that must elect or defeat him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: \"The Barnburners made the Monumental City lurid with\r\ntheir wrath, frightening the delegates from the back States almost out\r\nof their wits.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 162. \"Or, as\r\none man said in a speech, 'the regular delegates might occupy half a\r\nseat apiece, provided each of them would let a Hunker sit on his\r\nlap.'\"--_Ibid._, p. 161.]\r\n\r\nReturning home, the Barnburners issued an address, written by Samuel\r\nJ. Tilden, who fearlessly called upon Democrats to act independently.\r\nThis led to the famous convention held at Utica in June. Samuel Young\r\npresided, Churchill C. Cambreling was conspicuous on the stage, David\r\nDudley Field read a letter from Martin Van Buren condemning the\r\nplatform and the candidate of the Baltimore convention, and Benjamin\r\nF. Butler, Preston King, and John Van Buren illuminated the principles\r\nof the Free-soil party in speeches that have seldom been surpassed in\r\npolitical conventions. In the end Martin Van Buren was nominated for\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThis assembly, in the ability and character of its members, contained\r\nthe better portion of the party. Its attitude was strong, defiant, and\r\nits only purpose apparently was to create a public sentiment hostile\r\nto the extension of slavery. Nevertheless, it was divided into two\r\nfactions, one actuated more by a desire to avenge the alleged wrongs\r\nof Van Buren, than to limit slavery. To this class belonged Churchill\r\nC. Cambreling, Samuel J. Tilden, John A. Dix, Sanford E. Church, Dean\r\nRichmond, John Cochrane, Benjamin F. Butler, and the Van Burens. On\r\nthe anti-slavery side, Preston King, David Dudley Field, James S.\r\nWadsworth, and William Cullen Bryant were conspicuous. Seven years\r\nlater, these men were quick to aid in the formation of the Republican\r\nparty; while the former, for the most part, continued with the\r\nDemocratic party. But, whatever the motives that prompted them, their\r\naction strengthened the Buffalo convention[375] which met on August 9,\r\n1848, giving an impetus to the anti-slavery cause too strong for\r\nresentment or revenge to guide it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: \"The nomination of Cass for the Presidency by the\r\nDemocrats and Taylor by the Whigs led to the Buffalo convention of\r\n1848. Pro-slavery Democrats were there to avenge the wrongs of Martin\r\nVan Buren. Free-soil Democrats were there to punish the assassins of\r\nSilas Wright. Pro-slavery Whigs were there to strike down Taylor\r\nbecause he had dethroned their idol, Henry Clay, in the Philadelphia\r\nconvention. Anti-slavery Whigs were there, breathing the spirit of the\r\ndeparted John Quincy Adams. Abolitionists of all shades of opinion\r\nwere present, from the darkest type to those of a milder hue, who\r\nshared the views of Salmon P. Chase.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random\r\nRecollections_, pp. 162-63.]\r\n\r\nThere have been many important meetings in the history of American\r\npolitics, but it may well be doubted if any convention, during the\r\nstruggle with slavery, ever exalted the hearts of those who took part\r\nin it more than did this assembly of fearless representatives of the\r\nFree-soil party in Buffalo, the Queen City of the Lakes. The time was\r\nripe for action, and on that day in August, men eminent and to grow\r\neminent, sought the shade of a great tent on the eastern shore of Lake\r\nErie. Among them were Joshua R. Giddings, the well-known Abolitionist;\r\nSalmon P. Chase, not yet famous, but soon to become a United States\r\nsenator with views of slavery in accord with William H. Seward; and\r\nCharles Francis Adams who had already associated his name with that of\r\nhis illustrious father in the growth of anti-slavery opinions in New\r\nEngland. Chase presided over the convention and Adams over the\r\nmass-meeting. At the outset, it was boldly asserted that they had\r\nassembled \"to secure free soil for a free people;\" and in closing they\r\nthrilled the hearts of all hearers with the memorable declaration that\r\nrang throughout the land like a blast from a trumpet, \"We inscribe on\r\nour banner Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labour, and Free Men.\" It was\r\na remarkable convention in that it made no mistakes. Lewis Cass\r\nrepresented the South and its purposes, while Zachary Taylor lived in\r\nthe South and owned four hundred slaves. Neither of these men could\r\nbe supported; but, in the end, rather than put a fourth candidate into\r\nthe field, it was resolved unanimously to indorse Martin Van Buren for\r\nPresident and Charles Francis Adams for Vice President. Daniel Webster\r\nridiculed the idea of \"the leader of the Free-_spoil_ party becoming\r\nthe leader of the Free-soil party;\" but Charles Sumner, whose heart\r\nwas in the cause, declared that \"it is not for the Van Buren of 1838\r\nthat we are to vote, but for the Van Buren of to-day--the veteran\r\nstatesman, sagacious, determined, experienced, who, at an age when\r\nmost men are rejoicing to put off their armour, girds himself anew and\r\nenters the list as a champion of freedom.\"[376] To give further dignity\r\nand importance to the Free-soil movement, the nomination of John P.\r\nHale, made by the Abolitionists in the preceding November, was\r\nwithdrawn, and John A. Dix, then a Democratic senator, accepted the\r\nBarnburners' nomination for governor.[377]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: Charles Sumner, _Works_, Vol. 2, p. 144.\r\n\r\n\"It will be remembered that Van Buren, in his inaugural as President,\r\npledged himself to veto any bill for the abolition of slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, unless sanctioned by Maryland and Virginia.\r\nAnti-slavery men took great umbrage to this pledge, and while Butler\r\nat the Buffalo convention was graphically describing how the\r\nex-President, now absorbed in bucolic pursuits at his Kinderhook farm,\r\nhad recently leaped a fence to show his visitor a field of sprouting\r\nturnips, one of these disgusted Abolitionists abruptly exclaimed,\r\n'Damn his turnips! What are his present opinions about the abolition\r\nof slavery in the District of Columbia?' 'I was just coming to that\r\nsubject,' responded the oily Barnburner, with a suave bow towards the\r\nruffled Whig. 'Well, you can't be a moment too quick in coming to it,'\r\nreplied the captious interlocutor.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random\r\nRecollections_, p. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: \"General Dix disapproved of the design to make separate\r\nnominations, thinking it unwise, and foreseeing that it would increase\r\nthe difficulty of bringing about a reconciliation. But that he, a\r\nDemocrat of the old school, should find himself associated with\r\ngentlemen of the Whig party, from whom he differed on almost every\r\npoint, was a painful and distressing surprise. He was willing, if it\r\nmust be so, to go with his own section of the Democratic party, though\r\ndeeming their course not the wisest. But when it came to an alliance\r\nwith Whigs and Abolitionists he lost all heart in the movement. This\r\naccounts for his strong expressions in after years to justify himself\r\nfrom the charge of being an Abolitionist and false to his old\r\nfaith.\"--Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 1, p. 239.]\r\n\r\nThe Hunkers were aghast. The movement that let the Whigs into power in\r\n1847 had suddenly become a national party, with the most famous and\r\ndistinguished Democrat at its head, while the old issues of internal\r\nimprovement, the tariff, and the independent treasury were obscured by\r\nthe intensity of the people's opposition to the extension of slavery.\r\nThe Hunkers controlled the party machinery--the Barnburners held the\r\nbalance of power. To add to the bitterness of the situation, Edwin\r\nCroswell, after a quarter of a century of leadership, had retired from\r\neditorial and political life, leaving no one who could fill his place.\r\nWhen the Democratic state convention assembled at Syracuse, therefore,\r\nit spent itself in rhetorical denunciation of the rebellious faction,\r\nand wasted itself in the selection of Reuben H. Walworth for governor\r\nand Charles O'Conor for lieutenant-governor. Neither was a popular\r\nnomination. Walworth was the last of the chancellors. He came into\r\nnotice as an ardent Bucktail in the days of DeWitt Clinton, and, upon\r\nthe retirement of Chancellor Kent in 1828 succeeded to that important\r\nand lucrative office. He was a hard worker and an upright judge; but\r\nhe did not rank as a great jurist. The lawyers thought him slow and\r\ncrabbed, and his exclusion from the office at the age of fifty-nine,\r\nafter the adoption of the new Constitution in 1846, was not regretted.\r\nBut Chancellor Walworth had two traits which made him a marked figure\r\nin the Commonwealth--an enthusiasm for his profession that spared no\r\nlabour and left no record unsearched; and an enthusiastic love for the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nOf Charles O'Conor's remarkable abilities, mention occurs elsewhere.\r\nHis conservatism made him a Democrat of the extreme school. In the\r\nSlave Jack case and the Lemmon slave case, very famous in their day,\r\nhe was counsel for the slave-holders; and at the close of the Civil\r\nWar he became the attorney for Jefferson Davis when indicted for\r\ntreason. O'Conor's great power as a speaker added much to the\r\nentertainment of the campaign of 1848, but whether he would have\r\nbeaten his sincere, large-hearted, and affectionate Whig opponent had\r\nno third party divided the vote, was a mooted question at the time,\r\nand one usually settled in favour of the Chautauquan.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs had reason to be hopeful. They had elected Young in 1846 by\r\neleven thousand, and, because of the Barnburner secession, had carried\r\nthe State in 1847 by thirty thousand. Everything indicated that their\r\nsuccess in 1848 would be no less sweeping. But they were far from\r\nhappy. Early in June, 1846, long before the capture of Monterey and\r\nthe victory of Buena Vista, the Albany _Evening Journal_ had suggested\r\nthat Zachary Taylor was in the minds of many, and in the hearts of\r\nmore, for President in 1848. Thurlow Weed went further. He sent word\r\nto the brilliant officer that he need not reply to the numerous\r\nletters from men of all political stripes offering their support,\r\nsince the presidential question would take care of itself after his\r\ntriumphant return from Mexico. But, in the spring of 1848, the\r\nquestion became embarrassing. Taylor was a slave-holder. Many northern\r\nWhigs were deeply imbued with anti-slavery sentiments, and the action\r\nof the Free-soilers was increasing their sensitiveness. \"What plagues\r\nme most of all,\" wrote Washington Hunt to Weed, \"is to think how I,\r\nafter all I have said against slavery and its extension, am to look\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso people in the face and ask them to vote for a\r\nSouthern slave-holder.\"[378] Yet Taylor was a conquering hero; and,\r\nalthough little was known of his political sentiments or sympathies,\r\nit was generally believed the Democrats would nominate him for\r\nPresident if the Whigs did not.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n165.]\r\n\r\nAs the year grew older it became apparent that Henry Clay was the\r\nchoice of a large portion of the Whigs of the country. Besides, Daniel\r\nWebster had reappeared as a candidate; Winfield Scott had the support\r\nof his former New York friends; and Horace Greeley, \"waging a quixotic\r\nwar against heroes,\" as Seward expressed it, was sure of defeating\r\nTaylor even if shaken in his confidence of nominating Clay. \"I hope\r\nyou see your way through this difficulty,\" Hunt again wrote Weed. \"You\r\nare like a deacon I know. His wife said it always came natural to him\r\nto see into the doctrine of election.\"[379] Weed believed that Zachary\r\nTaylor, if not nominated by the Whigs, would be taken up by the\r\nDemocrats, and he favoured the Southerner because the election of\r\nJackson and Harrison convinced him that winning battles opened a sure\r\nway to the White House. But Thurlow Weed was not a stranger to\r\nTaylor's sympathies. He had satisfied himself that the bluff old\r\nwarrior, though a native of Virginia and a Louisiana slave-holder,\r\nfavoured domestic manufactures, opposed the admission of Texas, and\r\nhad been a lifelong admirer of Henry Clay; and, with this information,\r\nhe went to work, cautiously as was his custom, but with none the less\r\nenergy and persistence. Among other things, he visited Daniel Webster\r\nat Marshfield to urge him to accept the nomination for Vice President.\r\nThe great statesman recalled Weed's similar errand in 1839, and the\r\nmemory of Harrison's sudden death now softened him into a receptive\r\nmood; but the inopportune coming of Fletcher Webster, who reported\r\nthat his father's cause was making tremendous progress, changed\r\nconsent into disapproval, and for the second time in ten years Webster\r\nlost the opportunity of becoming President.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n167.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Whig national convention met in Philadelphia on June 8,\r\nThurlow Weed did not doubt the ability of Taylor's friends to nominate\r\nhim; but, in that event, several prominent delegates threatened to\r\nbolt. It was an anxious moment. The success of the Whig party and the\r\nascendancy of Weed's leadership in New York were at stake. It was\r\nurged by the anti-slavery men with great vehemence that Taylor was a\r\n\"no-party man,\" and that as a born Southerner and large slave-holder\r\nhe could not be trusted on the slavery question. But when the five\r\ncandidates were finally placed in nomination, and a single ballot\r\ntaken, it was found, as Weed had predicted, that the hero of Buena\r\nVista was the one upon whom the Whigs could best unite. With few\r\nexceptions, the friends of Clay, Webster, Scott, and John M. Clayton\r\ncould go to Taylor better than to another, and on the fourth ballot,\r\namidst anger and disappointment, the latter was nominated by sixty\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, the office of Vice President seemed to go a-begging,\r\nas it did in the convention of 1839 after the defeat of Henry Clay.\r\nEarly in the year Seward's friends urged his candidacy; but he gave it\r\nno encouragement, preferring to continue the practice of his\r\nprofession, which was now large and lucrative. John Young, who thought\r\nhe would like the place, sent a secret agent to Mexico with letters to\r\nTaylor. Young's record as governor, however, did not commend him for\r\nother honours, and the scheme was soon abandoned. As the summer\r\nadvanced Abbott Lawrence of Massachusetts became the favourite; and\r\nfor a time it seemed as if his nomination would be made by\r\nacclamation; but, after Taylor's nomination and Clay's defeat, many\r\ndelegates promptly declared they would not have \"cotton at both ends\r\nof the ticket\"--referring to Taylor as a grower and Lawrence as a\r\nmanufacturer of cotton. In this crisis, and after a stormy recess,\r\nJohn A. Collier, a leading lawyer of Binghamton, who had served in the\r\nTwenty-second Congress and one year as state comptroller, suddenly\r\ntook the platform. In a stirring speech, in which he eloquently\r\npictured the sorrow and bitterness of Clay's friends, he hopefully\r\nannounced that he had a peace-offering to present, which, if accepted,\r\nwould, in a measure, reconcile the supporters of all the defeated\r\ncandidates and prevent a fatal breach in the party. Then, to the\r\nastonishment of the convention, he named Millard Fillmore for Vice\r\nPresident, and asked a unanimous response to his nomination. This\r\nspeech, though not pitched in a very exalted key, was so subtile and\r\ntelling, that it threw the convention into applause. Collier recalled\r\nFillmore's fidelity to his party; his satisfactory record in Congress,\r\nespecially during the passage of the tariff act of 1842; his splendid,\r\nif unsuccessful canvass, as a candidate for governor in 1844, and his\r\nrecent majority of thirty-eight thousand for comptroller, the largest\r\never given any candidate in the State. At the time, it looked as if a\r\nunanimous response might be made; but the friends of Lawrence rallied,\r\nand at the close of the ballot Fillmore had won by only six votes. For\r\nCollier, however, it was a great triumph, giving him a reputation as a\r\nspeaker that later efforts did not sustain.\r\n\r\nTo anti-slavery delegates, the Philadelphia convention was a\r\ndisappointment. It seemed to lack courage and to be without\r\nconvictions or principles. Like its predecessor in 1839 it adopted no\r\nresolutions and issued no address. The candidates became its platform.\r\nIn voting down a resolution in favour of the Wilmot Proviso, many\r\ndelegates believed the party would prove faithless on the great issue;\r\nand fifteen of them, led by Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, proposed a\r\nnational convention of all persons opposed to the extension of\r\nslavery, to be held at Buffalo early in August. \"It is fortunate for\r\nus,\" wrote Seward, \"that the Democratic party is divided.\"[380] But the\r\nNew Yorkers, some of whom found encouragement in the nomination of\r\nFillmore, who had thus far been inflexible upon the slavery question,\r\npatiently waited for the result of the Whig state convention, which\r\nmet at Utica on the 14th of September. By this time, as Seward and\r\nWeed predicted, Taylor's nomination had grown popular. Greeley, soon\r\nto be a candidate for Congress, advised the _Tribune's_ readers to\r\nvote the Whig ticket, while the action of the Buffalo convention,\r\nthough it united the anti-slavery vote, assured a division of the\r\nDemocratic party more than sufficient to compensate for any Whig\r\nlosses. Under these circumstances, the Utica convention assembled with\r\nreasonable hopes of success. It lacked the spirit of the band of\r\nresolute Free-soilers, who met in the same place on the same day and\r\nnominated John A. Dix for governor and Seth M. Gates of Wyoming for\r\nlieutenant-governor; but it gave no evidence of the despair that had\r\nsettled upon the convention of the Hunkers in the preceding week.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 71.]\r\n\r\nOne feature of the Whig state convention is worthy of notice. The\r\ngreat influence of the Anti-Renters who held the balance of power in\r\nthe convention of 1846 had disappeared. The Governor's anti-rent\r\nfriends urged his renomination with the earnest voice of a brave\r\npeople; but John Young was destined to be the comet of a season only.\r\nHis course in respect to appointments and to the Mexican War had\r\nalienated Thurlow Weed, and his pardon of the anti-rent rioters\r\nestranged the conservative Whigs. Although a shrewd politician, with\r\nfrank and affable manners, as an administrative officer he lacked the\r\ntact displayed so abundantly as a legislator; and its absence\r\nseriously handicapped him. Twenty delegates measured his strength in a\r\nconvention that took forty-nine votes to nominate. Under the Taylor\r\nadministration, Young received an appointment as assistant treasurer\r\nin New York City--the office given to William C. Bouck in 1846--but\r\nhis career may be said to have closed the moment he promised to pardon\r\na lot of murderous rioters to secure an election as governor. With\r\nthat, he passed out of the real world of state-craft into the class of\r\npoliticians whose ambition and infirmities have destroyed their\r\nusefulness. He died in April, 1852, at the age of fifty.\r\n\r\nHamilton Fish was the favourite candidate for governor in the Utica\r\nconvention. His sympathies leaned toward the conservatives of his\r\nparty; but the moderation of his speech and his conciliatory manners\r\nsecured the good wishes of both factions, and he received seventy-six\r\nvotes on the first ballot. Fish was admittedly one of the most popular\r\nyoung men in New York City. He had never sought or desired office. In\r\n1842, the friends of reform sent him to Congress from a strong\r\nDemocratic district, and in 1846, after repeatedly and peremptorily\r\ndeclining, the Whig convention, to save the party from disruption,\r\ncompelled him to take the nomination for lieutenant-governor on the ticket\r\nwith John Young. In 1847, after Addison Gardiner, by his appointment\r\nto the Court of Appeals, had vacated the lieutenant-governorship,\r\nthe convention, in resentment of Fish's defeat by the Anti-Renters,\r\nagain forced his nomination for the same office, and his election\r\nfollowed by thirty thousand majority. Fish was now thirty-nine years\r\nold, with more than two-score and five years to live. He was to become\r\na United States senator, and to serve, for eight years, with\r\ndistinguished ability, as secretary of state in the Cabinet of\r\nPresident Grant; yet, in all that period, he never departed from the\r\nsimple, sincere life that he was living in September, 1848. Writing of\r\nhim in the _Tribune_, on the day after his nomination for governor,\r\nHorace Greeley voiced the sentiment of men irrespective of party.\r\n\"Wealthy without pride, generous without ostentation, simple in\r\nmanners, blameless in life, and accepting office with no other\r\naspiration than that of making power subserve the common good of his\r\nfellow citizens, Hamilton Fish justly and eminently enjoys the\r\nconfidence and esteem of all who know him.\"[381]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: New York _Tribune_, September 15, 1848.]\r\n\r\nOn the first ballot, George W. Patterson of Chautauqua received\r\neighty-four out of ninety-six votes for lieutenant-governor. In his\r\ngentle manners, simple generosity, and moderation of speech, Patterson\r\nwas not unlike Hamilton Fish. He was a loyal friend of Seward, a\r\nconstant correspondent of Weed, and a member of the inner circle of\r\ngoverning Whigs; he had been prominent as an Anti-Mason, satisfactory\r\nas a legislator, and impartial as a speaker of the Assembly; he was\r\nnow recognised as a far-sighted, wise, and cautious politician. In\r\nguiding the convention to the selection of Hamilton Fish and George W.\r\nPatterson, it was admitted that Thurlow Weed's leadership vindicated\r\nhis sagacity.\r\n\r\nThe political contest in New York, unlike that in the South and in\r\nsome Western States, presented the novel feature of three powerful\r\nparties in battle array. The Free-soil faction was a strange mixture.\r\nBesides Barnburners, there were Conscience Whigs, Proviso Democrats,\r\nLand Reformers, Workingmen, and Abolitionists--a formidable\r\ncombination of able and influential men who wielded the power of\r\nabsolute disinterestedness, and who kept step with John Van Buren's\r\ntrenchant and eloquent speeches which resounded through the State. Van\r\nBuren was the accepted leader, and in this campaign he reached the\r\nheight of his reputation. His features were not striking, but in\r\nperson he was tall, symmetrical, and graceful; and no one in the State\r\ncould hold an audience with such delightful oratory and lofty\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nThe ablest Whig to oppose him was William H. Seward, who frequently\r\nfollowed him in localities where Whigs were likely to act with the\r\nFree-soil party. On the slavery question, Seward held views identical\r\nwith those expressed by Van Buren; but he insisted that every Whig\r\nvote cast for the third party was only a negative protest against the\r\nslavery party. Real friends of emancipation must not be content with\r\nprotests. They must act wisely and efficiently. \"For myself,\" he\r\ndeclared, \"I shall cast my suffrage for General Taylor and Millard\r\nFillmore, freely and conscientiously, on precisely the same grounds on\r\nwhich I have hitherto voted.\"[382]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 77.]\r\n\r\nAs in former presidential years, each party had its flags and banners,\r\nits drums and cannon, its bewildering variety of inscriptions and\r\nmottoes, and its multitude of speakers charging and countercharging\r\ninconsistencies and maladministration. The Whigs accused Cass with\r\nhaving printed two biographies, one for the South, in which he\r\nappeared as a slavery extensionist, and one for the North, in which he\r\nfigured as a Wilmot Provisoist. To this accusation, Democrats retorted\r\nthat the Whigs opposed annexation in the North and favoured it in the\r\nSouth; denounced the war and nominated its leading general; voted down\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso in June, and upheld it in July.\r\n\r\nIn New York, New England, and in some parts of the West, the clear,\r\ncomprehensive, ringing platform of the anti-slavery party had fixed\r\nthe issue. Audiences became restless if asked to listen to arguments\r\nupon other topics. Opposition to slavery was, at last, respectable in\r\npolitics. For the first time, none of his party deprecated Seward's\r\nadvanced utterances upon this question, and from August to November he\r\nfreely voiced his opinions. The series of professional achievements\r\nwhich began with the Freeman case was still in progress; but he laid\r\nthem aside that he might pass through his own State into New England,\r\nand from thence through New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, into Ohio,\r\nwhere the result, as shown by the October election, was to be very\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nSeward was now in the fulness of his intellectual power. There was\r\nnothing sensational, nothing unfit in his speeches. He believed that\r\nthe conscience of the people was a better guide than individual\r\nambitions, and he inspired them with lofty desires and filled them\r\nwith sound principles of action. \"There are two antagonistic elements\r\nof society in America,\" said he, in his speech at Cleveland, \"freedom\r\nand slavery. Freedom is in harmony with our system of government and\r\nwith the spirit of the age, and is, therefore, passive and quiescent.\r\nSlavery is in conflict with that system, with justice, and with\r\nhumanity, and is, therefore, organised, defensive, active, and\r\nperpetually aggressive. Freedom insists on the emancipation and\r\nelevation of labour. Slavery demands a soil moistened with tears and\r\nblood. These elements divide and classify the American people into two\r\nparties. Each of these parties has its court and sceptre. The throne\r\nof the one is amid the rocks of the Allegheny Mountains; the throne of\r\nthe other is reared on the sands of South Carolina. One of these\r\nparties, the party of slavery, regards disunion as among the means of\r\ndefence and not always the last to be employed. The other maintains\r\nthe Union of the States, one and inseparable, now and forever, as the\r\nhighest duty of the American people to themselves, to posterity, to\r\nmankind. It is written in the Constitution that five slaves shall\r\ncount equal to three freemen as a basis of representation, and it is\r\nwritten also, in violation of the Divine Law, that we shall surrender\r\nthe fugitive slave who takes refuge at our fireside from his\r\nrelentless pursuers. 'What, then,' you say; 'can nothing be done for\r\nfreedom because the public conscience is inert?' Yes, much can be\r\ndone--everything can be done. Slavery can be limited to its present\r\nbounds; it can be ameliorated; it can and must be abolished, and you\r\nand I can and must do it.\"[383]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 86.]\r\n\r\nThis presented an epitome of Seward's views when spoken without\r\nrestraint. His friends thought them \"bold\" and his opponents denounced\r\nthem as \"most perverse and dogmatic,\" but, whether bold or perverse,\r\nhe devoted the chief part of every speech to them. He was not without\r\nhumour, man's highest gift, but he had more of humanity; he spoke\r\nseriously and solemnly, usually to grave, sober, reflecting men of all\r\nprofessions and parties; and, at the end of two hours, dismissed them\r\nas if from an evening church service. At Boston, a Whig member of\r\nCongress from Illinois spoke with him, principally upon the\r\nmaladministration of the Democrats and the inconsistencies of Lewis\r\nCass. After the meeting, while sitting in their hotel, the\r\ncongressman, with a thoughtful air, said to Seward: \"I have been\r\nthinking about what you said in your speech to-night. I reckon you are\r\nright. We have got to deal with this slavery question, and got to give\r\nmuch more attention to it hereafter than we have been doing.\"[384]\r\nThis was Seward's first meeting with Abraham Lincoln. The former was\r\nthen forty-seven years old, the latter thirty-nine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: _Ibid._, p. 80.]\r\n\r\nIn New York, the campaign could have but one outcome. The Free-soil\r\nfaction divided the Democratic vote nearly by two, giving Van Buren\r\n120,000, Cass 114,000, and Taylor 218,000. The returns for governor\r\nvaried but slightly from these figures.[385] In the country at large\r\nTaylor secured one hundred and sixty-three electoral votes and Cass\r\none hundred and twenty-seven. But, a Whig majority of one hundred and\r\nfour on joint ballot in the Legislature, and the election of\r\nthirty-one out of thirty-four congressmen, showed the wreckage of a\r\ndivided Democracy in New York. The Hunkers elected only six\r\nassemblymen; the Free-soilers secured fourteen. The Whigs had one\r\nhundred and eight. Returns from all the counties and cities in no wise\r\ndiffered. The Hunkers had been wiped out. If the Free-soilers did not\r\nget office, they had demonstrated their strength, and exulted in\r\nhaving routed their adversaries. Although Martin Van Buren was not to\r\nleave his retirement at Lindenwald, the brilliant son had avenged his\r\nfather's wrongs by dashing Lewis Cass rudely and ruthlessly to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: Hamilton Fish, 218,776; John A. Dix, 122,811; Reuben H.\r\nWalworth, 116,811; William Goodell, 1593.--_Civil List, State of New\r\nYork_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSEWARD SPLITS THE WHIG PARTY\r\n\r\n1849-1850\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of 1849 became the scene of a contest that ended in a\r\nrout. John A. Dix's term as United States senator expired on March 4,\r\nand the fight for the succession began the moment the Whig members\r\nknew they had a majority.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Seward's old enemies seemed ubiquitous. They had neither\r\nforgotten his distribution of patronage, nor forgiven his interest in\r\nslaves and immigrants. To make their opposition effective, John A.\r\nCollier became a candidate. Collier wanted to be governor in 1838,\r\nwhen Weed threw the nomination to Seward; and, although his election\r\nas comptroller in 1841 had restored friendly relations with Weed, he\r\nhad never forgiven Seward. It added strength to the coalition,\r\nmoreover, that Fillmore and Collier were now bosom friends. The\r\nlatter's speech at Philadelphia had made the Buffalonian Vice\r\nPresident, and his following naturally favoured Collier. It was a\r\nnoisy company, and, for a time, its opposition seemed formidable.\r\n\r\n\"Fillmore and Collier came down the river in the boat with me,\" wrote\r\nSeward from New York on November 16, 1848. \"The versatile people were\r\nfull of demonstrations of affection to the Vice President, and Mr.\r\nCollier divided the honours. The politicians of New York are engaged\r\nin plans to take possession of General Taylor before he comes to\r\nWashington. Weed is to be supplanted, and that not for his own sake\r\nbut for mine.\"[386] As the days passed intrigue became bolder.\r\nHamilton Fish, Washington Hunt, and other prominent members of the\r\nparty, were offered the senatorship. \"I wish you could see the letters\r\nI get,\" Hunt wrote to Weed. \"If I wanted to excite your sympathy they\r\nwould be sufficient. Some say Seward will be elected. More say neither\r\nSeward nor Collier will be chosen, but a majority are going for a\r\nthird man by way of compromise, and my consent is invoked to be number\r\nthree.\"[387] Then came the letter, purporting to be written by Seward,\r\ndeclaring that \"Collier must be defeated, or our influence with the\r\nAdministration will be curtailed. You must look to your members, and\r\nsee the members from Cattaraugus, if possible. I think Patterson will\r\ntake care of Chautauqua.\"[388] Out of this forgery grew an acrimonious\r\nmanifesto from Collier, who professed to believe that Seward was\r\ngiving personal attention to the work of making himself senator. In\r\nthe midst of this violent and bitter canvass, Horace Greeley wrote one\r\nof his characteristic editorials. \"We care not who may be the\r\nnominee,\" said the _Tribune_ of January 24, 1849. \"We shall gladly\r\ncoincide in the fair expression of the will of the majority of the\r\nparty, but we kindly caution those who disturb and divide us, that\r\ntheir conduct will result only in the merited retribution which an\r\nindignant people will visit upon those who prostitute their temporary\r\npower to personal pique or selfish purposes.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 87.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: New York _Herald_, December 1, 1848.]\r\n\r\nSeward was continuously in Baltimore and Washington, studying briefs\r\nthat had accumulated in his long absence during the campaign; but\r\nWeed, the faithful friend, like a sentinel on the watch-tower, kept\r\nclosely in touch with the political situation. \"The day before the\r\nlegislative caucus,\" wrote an eye-witness, \"the Whig members of the\r\nLegislature gathered around the editor of the _Evening Journal_ for\r\ncounsel and advice. It resembled a President's levee. He remained\r\nstanding in the centre of the room, conversing with those about him\r\nand shaking hands with new-comers; but there was nothing in his\r\nmanner to indicate the slightest mystery or excitement so common with\r\npoliticians.\"[389]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n174.]\r\n\r\nThe Whig senators met in caucus on January 29, and by a vote of twelve\r\nto eleven decided to join the Assembly. Then the fight began. William\r\nS. Johnson, a Whig senator from New York City, declared that he would\r\nneither vote for Seward in caucus nor support him in the Legislature.\r\n\"It would be equivalent,\" he continued, \"to throwing a firebrand into\r\nthe South and aiding in the dissolution of the Whig party and of the\r\nUnion.\" Thereupon the eleven withdrew from further participation in\r\nthe proceedings. When the caucus of the two houses convened, fourteen\r\nmembers declared it inexpedient to support either Seward or Collier;\r\nbut an informal ballot gave Seward eighty-eight votes and Collier\r\ntwelve, with twenty-two scattering. Three days later, on joint ballot,\r\nSeward received one hundred and twenty-one out of one hundred and\r\nthirty Whig votes. \"We were always confident that the caucus could\r\nhave but one result,\" said the _Tribune_, \"and the lofty anticipations\r\nwhich the prospect of Seward's election has excited will not be\r\ndisappointed.\"\r\n\r\nSuccessful as Seward had been in his profession since leaving the\r\noffice of governor, he was not entirely happy. \"I look upon my life,\r\nbusy as it is, as a waste,\" he wrote, in 1847. \"I live in a world that\r\nneeds my sympathies, but I have not even time nor opportunity to do\r\ngood.\"[390] His warm and affectionate heart seemed to envy the strife\r\nand obloquy that came to champions of freedom; yet his published\r\ncorrespondence nowhere directly indicates a desire to return to public\r\nlife. \"You are not to suppose me solicitous on the subject that drags\r\nme so unpleasantly before the public,\" he wrote Weed on January 26,\r\n1849, three days before the caucus. \"I have looked at it in all its\r\nrelations, and cannot satisfy myself that it would be any better for\r\nme to succeed than to be beaten.\"[391] This assumed indifference,\r\nhowever, was written with a feeling of absolute confidence that he\r\nwas to succeed, a confidence that brought with it great content, since\r\nthe United States Senate offered the \"opportunity\" for which he sighed\r\nin his despondent letter of 1847. On the announcement of his election,\r\nconveyed to him by wire at Washington, he betrayed no feeling except\r\none of humility. \"I tremble,\" he wrote his wife, \"when I think of the\r\ndifficulty of realising the expectations which this canvass has\r\nawakened in regard to my abilities.\"[392] To Weed, he added: \"I recall\r\nwith fresh gratitude your persevering and magnanimous friendship.\"[393]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: _Ibid._, p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 98.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: _Ibid._, p. 99.]\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, difficulties confronted the new senator. The question\r\nof limiting slavery excited the whole country, and one holding his\r\nviews belonged in the centre of the struggle. But strife for office\r\ngave him more immediate embarrassment. Apprehensive of party discord,\r\nThurlow Weed, at a dinner given the Vice President and Senator, had\r\narranged for conferences between them upon important appointments\r\nwithin the State; but Seward's first knowledge of the New York\r\ncustom-house appointments came to him in an executive session for\r\ntheir confirmation. Seward, as Lincoln afterward said, \"was a man\r\nwithout gall,\" and he did not openly resent the infraction of the\r\nagreement; but when Weed, upon reaching Washington, discovered that\r\nFillmore had the ear of the simple and confiding President, he quickly\r\nsought the Vice President. Fillmore received him coldly. From that\r\nmoment began an estrangement between Weed and the Buffalo statesman\r\nwhich was to last until both were grown gray and civil war had\r\nobliterated differences of political sentiment. For twenty years,\r\ntheir intimacy had been uninterrupted and constantly strengthening.\r\nEven upon the slavery question their views coincided, and, although\r\nFillmore chafed under his growing preference for Seward and the\r\nlatter's evident intellectual superiority, he had exhibited no\r\nimpatience toward Weed. But Fillmore was now Vice President, with\r\naspirations for the Presidency, and he saw in Seward a formidable\r\nrival who would have the support of Weed whenever the Senator needed\r\nit. He rashly made up his mind, therefore, to end their relationship.\r\n\r\nWith Taylor, Weed was at his ease. The President remembered the\r\neditor's letter written in 1846, and what Weed now asked he quickly\r\ngranted. When Weed complained, therefore, that the Vice President was\r\nfilling federal offices with his own friends, the President dropped\r\nFillmore and turned to the Senator for suggestions. Seward accepted\r\nthe burden of looking after patronage. \"I detest and loathe this\r\nrunning to the President every day to protest against this man or\r\nthat,\"[394] he wrote; but the President cheerfully responded to his\r\nrequests. \"If the country is to be benefited by our services,\" he said\r\nto the Secretary of the Treasury, \"it seems to me that you and I ought\r\nto remember those to whose zeal, activity, and influence we are\r\nindebted for our places.\"[395]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n175.]\r\n\r\nWhile Weed employed his time in displacing Hunker office-holders with\r\nWhigs, the Democratic party was trying to reunite. It called for a\r\nbold hand. John Van Buren, with a courage born of genius, had struck\r\nit a terrible blow in the face of tremendous odds, the effect of which\r\nwas as gratifying to the Barnburners as it was disastrous to the\r\nHunkers. But, in 1849, the party professed to believe that a union of\r\nthe factions would result in victory, since their aggregate vote in\r\n1848 exceeded the Whig vote by sixteen thousand. It is difficult to\r\nrealise the arguments which persuaded the Barnburners to rejoin their\r\nadversaries whom they had declared, in no measured terms, to be guilty\r\nof the basest conduct; but, after infinite labour, Horatio Seymour\r\nestablished constructive harmony and practical co-operation. \"We are\r\nasked to compromise our principles,\" said John Van Buren. \"The day of\r\ncompromises is past; but, in regard to candidates for state offices,\r\nwe are still a commercial people. We will unite with our late\r\nantagonists.\"[396]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 165.]\r\n\r\nSeymour and Van Buren did not unite easily. From the first they were\r\nrivals. As an orator, Seymour was the more persuasive, logical, and\r\ncandid--Van Buren the more witty, sarcastic, and brilliant. Seymour\r\nwas conciliatory--Van Buren aggressive. Indeed, they had little in\r\ncommon save their rare mental and social gifts, and that personal\r\nmagnetism which binds followers with hooks of steel. But they stood\r\nnow at the head of their respective factions. When Van Buren,\r\ntherefore, finally consented to join Seymour in a division of the\r\nspoils, the two wings of the party quickly coalesced in the fall of\r\n1849 for the election of seven state officers. The Free-soil faction\r\nprofessed to retain its principles; and, by placing several\r\nAbolitionists upon the ticket, nine-tenths of that party also joined\r\nthe combination. But the spirit of the Free-soiler was absent. The man\r\nwhose genius and whose eloquence had been the most potent factor in\r\ndiscrediting the Hunkers now had no anti-slavery speeches to make and\r\nno anti-slavery resolutions to present. John Van Buren's\r\nidentification with the great movement, which he prophesied would\r\nstand so strong and work such wonders, was destined, after he had\r\navenged the insult to his father, to vanish like a breath. Nor did the\r\ncoalition of Hunkers, Barnburners, and Abolitionists prove so numerous\r\nor so solid that it could sweep the State. It did, indeed, carry the\r\nAssembly by two majority, and with the help of a portion of the\r\nAnti-Renters, who refused to support their own ticket, it elected four\r\nminor state officers; but the Whigs held the Senate, and, with\r\nmajorities ranging from fifteen hundred to five thousand, chose the\r\ncomptroller, the secretary of state, and the treasurer. Washington\r\nHunt, the popular Whig candidate for comptroller, led the ticket by\r\nnearly six thousand, a triumph that was soon to bring him higher\r\nhonours.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, however, were to have their day of trouble. The election of\r\nTaylor and Fillmore had fired the Southern heart with zeal to defend\r\nslavery. More than eighty members of Congress issued an address, drawn\r\nby John C. Calhoun, rebuking the agitation of the slavery question,\r\ninsisting upon their right to take slaves into the territories, and\r\ncomplaining of the difficulty of recovering fugitives. The Virginia\r\nLegislature affirmed that the adoption and attempted enforcement of\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso would be resisted to the last extremity, and that\r\nthe abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia would be a direct\r\nattack upon the institution of the Southern States. These resolutions\r\nwere indorsed by Democratic conventions, approved at public meetings,\r\nand amplified by state legislatures. In Missouri, Tennessee, and\r\nKentucky the feeling quickly reached fever heat; in the cotton States\r\nsentiment boldly favoured \"A Southern Confederacy.\" Sectional interest\r\nmelted party lines. \"The Southern Whigs want the great question\r\nsettled in such a manner as shall not humble and exasperate the\r\nSouth,\" said the New York _Tribune_; \"the Southern Democrats want it\r\nso settled as to conduce to the extension of the power and influence\r\nof slavery.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this intense southern feeling Henry Clay, from his\r\nplace in the United States Senate, introduced the historic resolutions\r\nwhich bear his name, proposing an amicable adjustment of all questions\r\ngrowing out of the subject of slavery. This series of compromises was\r\nto admit California, establish territorial governments in the regions\r\nacquired from Mexico without provision for or against slavery, pay the\r\ndebt and fix the western boundary of Texas, declare it inexpedient to\r\nabolish slavery in the District of Columbia, deny the right of\r\nCongress to obstruct the slave trade between States, and to enact a\r\nmore stringent fugitive slave law. It was in January, 1850, that Clay\r\nopened the memorable debate upon these resolutions, which continued\r\neight months and included Webster's great speech of the 7th of March.\r\nWhen the debate ended in September Zachary Taylor was dead, Millard\r\nFillmore was President, a new Cabinet had been appointed, slavery\r\nremained undisturbed in the District of Columbia, Mexico and Utah had\r\nbecome territories open to slave-holders, and a new fugitive slave\r\nlaw bore the approval of the new Chief Executive. During these months\r\nthe whole country had been absorbed in events at Washington. Private\r\nletters, newspapers, public meetings, and state legislatures echoed\r\nthe speeches of the three distinguished Senators who had long been in\r\nthe public eye, and who, it was asserted at the time, were closing\r\ntheir life work in saving the Union.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion, Daniel S. Dickinson favoured compromise; William\r\nH. Seward stood firmly for his anti-slavery convictions. The latter\r\nspoke on the 11th of March. He opposed the fugitive slave law because\r\n\"we cannot be true Christians or real freemen if we impose on another\r\na chain that we defy all human power to lay on ourselves;\"[397] he\r\ndeclared for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,\r\n\"and if I shall be asked what I did to embellish the capital of my\r\ncountry, I will point to her freemen and say--these are the monuments\r\nof my munificence;\" he antagonised the right to take slaves into new\r\nterritories, affirming that the Constitution devoted the domain to\r\nunion, to justice, and to liberty. \"But there is a higher law than the\r\nConstitution,\" he said, \"which regulates our authority over the\r\ndomain, and devotes it to the same noble purposes.\" In treating of\r\nthreats of disunion he looked with a prophet's eye fourteen years into\r\nthe future. That vision revealed border warfare, kindred converted\r\ninto enemies, onerous taxes, death on the field and in the hospital,\r\nand conscription to maintain opposing forces. \"It will then appear\r\nthat the question of dissolving the Union is a complex question; that\r\nit embraces the fearful issue whether the Union shall stand and\r\nslavery be removed by gradual, voluntary effort, and with\r\ncompensation, or whether the Union shall be dissolved and civil war\r\nensue, bringing on violent but complete and immediate emancipation. We\r\nare now arrived at that stage of our national progress when that\r\ncrisis can be foreseen--when we must foresee it.\"[398]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: _Ibid._, p. 127.]\r\n\r\nA less fearless and determined nature must have been overwhelmed by\r\nthe criticism, the censure, and the insulting sneers which this speech\r\nprovoked. Southern feeling dominated the Senate chamber. Many northern\r\nmen, sincerely desirous of limiting slavery, preferred giving up the\r\nWilmot Proviso for the sake of peace. Thousands of Whigs regarded\r\ndissent from Clay and Webster, their time-honoured leaders, as bold\r\nand presumptuous. In reviewing Seward's speech, these people\r\npronounced it pernicious, unpatriotic, and wicked, especially since\r\n\"the higher law\" theory, taken in connection with his criticism of the\r\nfugitive slave law, implied that a humane and Christian people could\r\nnot or would not obey it. But the Auburn statesman resented nothing\r\nand retracted nothing. \"With the single exception of the argument in\r\npoor Freeman's case,\" he wrote, \"it is the only speech I ever made\r\nthat contains nothing I could afford to strike out or qualify.\"[399]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 129.]\r\n\r\nBut Seward's speech did not influence votes. Clay's compromises passed\r\namidst the wildest outbursts of popular enthusiasm. They appealed to a\r\nmajority of both the great parties as a final settlement of the\r\nslavery question. In New York and other cities throughout the State,\r\nflags were hoisted, salutes fired, joy bells rung, illuminations\r\nflamed at night, and speakers at mass-meetings congratulated their\r\nfellow citizens upon the wisdom of a President and a Congress that had\r\nhappily averted the great peril of disunion.\r\n\r\nThese exhibitions of gratitude were engrossing the attention of the\r\npeople when the Whig state convention met at Utica on the 26th of\r\nSeptember, 1850. Immediately, the approval of Seward's course assumed\r\nsupreme importance. Unusual excitement had attended the selection of\r\ndelegates. The new administration became aggressive. No secret was\r\nmade of its purpose to crush Thurlow Weed; and when the convention\r\nassembled, Hugh Maxwell, collector of the port of New York, and John\r\nYoung, sub-treasurer, were there to control it. A test vote for\r\ntemporary chairman disclosed sixty-eight Radicals and forty-one\r\nConservatives present, but in the interest of harmony Francis Granger\r\nbecame the permanent president.\r\n\r\nGranger was a man of honour and a man of intellect, whose qualities of\r\nfairness and fitness for public life have already been described. When\r\nhe entered Harrison's Cabinet in 1841, as postmaster-general, the\r\nSouth classed him as an Abolitionist; when he left Congress in 1843,\r\nin the fulness of his intellectual strength, his home at Canandaigua\r\nbecame the centre of an admiring group of Whigs who preferred the lead\r\nof Clay and the conservative policy of Webster. He now appeared as an\r\nally of President Fillmore. It was natural, perhaps, that in\r\nappointing a committee on resolutions, Granger should give advantage\r\nof numbers to his own faction, but the Radicals were amazed at the\r\nquestionable action of his committee. It delayed its report upon the\r\npretext of not being ready, and then, late in the evening, in the\r\nabsence of many delegates, presented what purported to be a unanimous\r\nexpression, in which Seward was left practically without mention. As\r\nthe delegates listened in profound silence the majority became\r\npainfully aware that something was wanting, and, before action upon it\r\ncould be taken, they forced an adjournment by a vote of fifty-six to\r\nfifty-one.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Radicals exhibited a desire for less harmony and\r\nmore justice. By a vote of seventy-three to forty-six the original\r\nresolutions were recommitted to an enlarged committee, and after\r\nnominating Washington Hunt for governor and George J. Cornwell for\r\nlieutenant-governor, substitute resolutions were adopted by a vote of\r\nseventy-four to forty-two. One difference between the original and the\r\nsubstitute centred in the organisation of new territories. The\r\nmajority opposed any surrender or waiver of the exclusion of slavery\r\nin any act establishing a regular civil organisation; the minority\r\nthought that, since it was impossible to secure the Wilmot Proviso, an\r\ninsistence upon which would prevent any territorial organisation, it\r\nwould be better to organise them without it, relying upon nature and\r\nthe known disposition of the inhabitants to follow the lead of\r\nCalifornia. This difference, however, could probably have been healed\r\nhad the Radicals not insisted that \"the thanks of the Whig party are\r\nespecially due to William H. Seward for the signal ability and\r\nfidelity with which he sustained those beloved principles of public\r\npolicy so long cherished by the Whigs of the Empire State, expressed\r\nin state and county conventions as well as in the votes and\r\ninstructions of the state legislature.\" Upon this resolution the\r\nConservatives demanded a roll call, and when its adoption, by the\r\nsurprising vote of seventy-five to forty, was announced, the minority,\r\namidst the wildest excitement, left the hall in a body, followed by\r\nFrancis Granger, whose silver gray hair gave a name to the seceders.\r\nTheir withdrawal was not a surprise. Like the secession of the\r\nBarnburners three years before, loud threats preceded action. Indeed,\r\nWilliam A. Duer, the Oswego congressman, admitted travelling from\r\nWashington to Syracuse with instructions from Fillmore to bolt the\r\napproval of Seward. But the secession seemed to disturb only the\r\nSilver-Grays themselves, who now drafted an address to the Whigs of\r\nthe State and called a new convention to assemble at Utica on October\r\n17.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats in their state convention, which met at Syracuse on\r\nSeptember 11, repeated the policy of conciliation so skilfully\r\nengineered in 1849 by Horatio Seymour. They received Barnburner\r\ndelegates, they divided the offices, and they allowed John Van Buren\r\nto rule. It mattered not what were the principles of the captivating\r\nPrince and his followers so long as they accepted \"the recent\r\nsettlement by Congress of questions which have unhappily divided the\r\npeople of these States.\" Thus the Free-soil Barnburners disappeared as\r\na political factor. Some of them continued to avow their anti-slavery\r\nprinciples, but no one had the temerity to mention them in convention.\r\nMen deemed it politic and prudent to affect to believe that the\r\nslavery question, which had threatened to disturb the national peace,\r\nwas finally laid at rest. The country so accepted it, trade and\r\ncommerce demanded it, and old political leaders conceded it. In this\r\nframe of mind, delegates found it easy to nominate Horatio Seymour for\r\ngovernor and Sanford E. Church for lieutenant-governor. The next day\r\nthe Abolitionists, tired of their union with Hunkers and Barnburners,\r\nnominated William L. Chaplin and Joseph Plumb.\r\n\r\nThe convention of the Silver-Grays, held at Utica in October, did not\r\nexalt its members. It was simply a protest. A lion-hearted man had\r\npresumed to voice his convictions, and, although the convention\r\nfavoured exercising a liberal spirit of toleration toward the\r\ncompromise measures, it refused to exercise such a spirit toward\r\nWilliam H. Seward, or to tolerate him at all. It gave the President a\r\nflattering indorsement for his approval of the fugitive slave law, it\r\naccepted Washington Hunt as its nominee for governor, and it listened\r\nto several addresses, among them one from James O. Putnam of Buffalo;\r\nbut the proceedings lacked the enthusiasm that springs from a clear\r\nprinciple, backed by a strong and resolute band of followers. The\r\nspeech of Putnam, however, attracted wide attention. Putnam was a\r\nyoung man then, less than thirty-three years old, passionately devoted\r\nto Daniel Webster, and a personal friend of Millard Fillmore. As a\r\nspeaker he was polished, smooth, and refined, and even when\r\nimpassioned kept his passion well within conventional bounds. On this\r\noccasion his mellow and far-reaching voice, keyed to the pitch of\r\nsustained rhetoric, dropped his well-balanced and finely moulded\r\nsentences into the convention amidst hearty applause. He did not then\r\nsee with the clearness of Seward's vision. He belonged rather to the\r\nmore enlightened and intelligent conservatives who had begun to feel\r\nthe ultimate disaster slavery must bring, and who desired that such\r\ndisaster should be put off as long as possible; but the day was soon\r\nto dawn in which he would become a loyal supporter of the principles\r\nthat were to be forever settled in the civil strife which Seward so\r\nvividly portrayed in the speech that created the Silver-Grays.\r\n\r\nThe recently adopted compromise did not become an issue in the New\r\nYork campaign of 1850. If its opponents could not approve, they deemed\r\nsilence wise. The followers of Fillmore in the up-state counties\r\ngenerally acted with the Seward men in support of Washington Hunt; but\r\na great meeting, held at Castle Garden, near the close of the\r\ncampaign, partially succeeded in uniting Democrats and Administration\r\nWhigs in New York City. A letter was read from Daniel Webster, calling\r\nupon all good citizens not to rekindle the flames of \"useless and\r\ndangerous controversy;\" resolutions favouring a vigorous enforcement\r\nof the fugitive slave law were adopted; and a coalition ticket with\r\nSeymour at its head was agreed upon. This meeting, called a great\r\npopular protest against demagoguery, opened an aggressive canvass to\r\ndefeat Hunt and destroy the Syracuse indorsement of Seward by raising\r\nthe cry that Seward Whigs preferred civil war to a peaceable\r\nenforcement of the fugitive slave law. Seward took no part in this\r\ncampaign. After Congress adjourned on the last day of September, he\r\ndevoted the short time between the sessions to his law business. His\r\nfriends, however, were active. Weed attacked the Castle Garden meeting\r\nwith a bitterness and vigour rarely disclosed in the columns of the\r\n_Evening Journal_, and Greeley poured one broadside after another into\r\nwhat he regarded as the miserable mismanagement, blundering, and\r\nconfusion of the Administration.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting the result of the election, people were startled into\r\nsadness by the sudden death of Samuel Young at the age of seventy-two.\r\nHe had retired in usual health, but died during the night. His\r\ndistinguished career, covering nearly two-score years, was\r\ncharacterised by strong prejudices, violent temper, and implacable\r\nresentments, which, kept him behind men of less aptitude for public\r\nservice; but he was always a central figure in any assemblage favoured\r\nwith his presence. He had a marvellous force of oratory. His, voice,\r\nhis gestures, his solemn pauses, followed by lofty and sustained\r\ndeclamation, proved irresistible and sometimes overwhelming in their\r\neffect. But it was his misfortune to be an orator with jaundiced\r\nvision, who seemed not always to see that principles controlled\r\noftener than rhetoric. Yet, he willingly walked on in his own wild,\r\nstormy way, apparently enjoying the excitement with no fear of danger.\r\n\"In his heart there was no guile,\" said Horace Greeley; \"in his face\r\nno dough.\"\r\n\r\nIt was several weeks after the election, before it was ascertained\r\nwhether Seymour or Hunt had been chosen. Both were popular, and of\r\nabout the same age. Washington Hunt seems to have devoted his life to\r\nan earnest endeavour to win everybody's good will. At this time\r\nGreeley thought him \"capable without pretension,\" and \"animated by an\r\nanxious desire to win golden opinions by deserving them.\" He had been\r\nsix years in Congress, and, in 1849, ran far ahead of his ticket as\r\ncomptroller. Horatio Seymour was no less successful in winning\r\napprobation. He had become involved in the canal controversy, but\r\ncarefully avoided the slavery question. Greeley found it in his heart\r\nto speak of him as \"an able and agreeable lawyer of good fortune and\r\ncompetent speaking talent, who would make a highly respectable\r\ngovernor.\" But 1850 was not Seymour's year. His associates upon the\r\nticket were elected by several thousand majority, and day after day\r\nhis own success seemed probable. The New York City combine gave him a\r\nsatisfactory majority; in two or three Hudson river counties he made\r\nlarge gains; but the official count gave Hunt two hundred and\r\nsixty-two plurality,[400] with a safe Whig majority in the\r\nLegislature. The Whigs also elected a majority of the congressmen.\r\n\"These results,\" wrote Thurlow Weed, \"will encourage the friends of\r\nfreedom to persevere by all constitutional means and through all\r\nrightful channels in their efforts to restrain the extension of\r\nslavery, and to wipe out that black spot wherever it can be done\r\nwithout injury to the rights and interests of others.\"[401]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: Washington Hunt, 214,614; Horatio Seymour,\r\n214,352.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 189.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE WHIGS' WATERLOO\r\n\r\n1850-1852\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of 1851 has a peculiar, almost romantic interest for New\r\nYorkers. A very young man, full of promise and full of performance,\r\nthe brilliant editor of a later day, the precocious politician of that\r\nday, became its speaker. Henry Jarvis Raymond was then in his\r\nthirty-first year. New York City had sent him to the Assembly in 1850,\r\nand he leaped into prominence the week he took his seat. He was ready\r\nin debate, temperate in language, quick in the apprehension of\r\nparliamentary rules, and of phenomenal tact. The unexcelled courtesy\r\nand grace of manner with which he dropped the measured and beautiful\r\nsentences that made him an orator, undoubtedly aided in obtaining the\r\nposition to which his genius entitled him. But his political\r\ninstincts, also, were admirable, and his aptness as an unerring\r\ncounsellor in the conduct of complicated affairs always turned to the\r\nadvantage of his party. There came a time, after the assassination of\r\nPresident Lincoln, when he made a mistake so grievous that he was\r\nnever able to regain his former standing; when he was dropped from the\r\nlist of party leaders; when his cordial affiliation with members of\r\nthe Republican organisation ceased; when his removal from the\r\nchairmanship of the National Committee was ratified by the action of a\r\nstate convention; but the sagacity with which he now commented upon\r\nwhat he saw and heard made the oldest members of the Assembly lean\r\nupon him. And when he came back to the Legislature in January, 1851,\r\nthey put him in the speaker's chair.\r\n\r\nRaymond seems never to have wearied of study, or to have found it\r\ndifficult easily to acquire knowledge. He could read at three years of\r\nage; at five he was a speaker. In his sixteenth year he taught school\r\nin Genesee County, where he was born, wrote a Fourth of July ode\r\ncreditable to one of double his years, and entered the University of\r\nVermont. As soon as he reached an age to appreciate his tastes and to\r\nform a purpose, he began equipping himself for the career of a\r\npolitical journalist. He was not yet twenty-one when he made Whig\r\nspeeches in the campaign of 1840 and gained employment with Horace\r\nGreeley on the _New Yorker_ and a little later on the _Tribune_. \"I\r\nnever found another person, barely of age and just from his studies,\r\nwho evinced so much and so versatile ability in journalism as he did,\"\r\nwrote Greeley. \"Abler and stronger men I may have met; a cleverer,\r\nreadier, more generally efficient journalist I never saw. He is the\r\nonly assistant with whom I ever felt required to remonstrate for doing\r\nmore work than any human brain and frame could be expected long to\r\nendure. His services were more valuable in proportion to their cost\r\nthan those of any one who ever worked on the _Tribune_.\"[402] In 1843,\r\nwhen Raymond left the _Tribune_, James Watson Webb, already acquainted\r\nwith the ripe intelligence and eager genius of the young man of\r\ntwenty-three, thought him competent to manage the _Courier and\r\nEnquirer_, and in his celebrated discussion with Greeley on the\r\nsubject of socialism he gave that paper something of the glory which\r\ntwelve years later crowned his labours upon the New York _Times_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: Horace Greeley, _Recollections of a Busy Life_, pp.\r\n138, 139.]\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that Raymond should hold office. The readiness with\r\nwhich he formulated answers to arguments in the Polk campaign, his\r\nsympathy with the Free-soil movement, the canal policy, and the common\r\nschool system, produced a marked impression upon the dawning wisdom of\r\nhis readers. But it was near the end of his connection with the\r\n_Courier_ before he yielded his own desires to the urgent solicitation\r\nof the Whigs of the ninth ward and went to the Assembly. He had not\r\nyet quarrelled with James Watson Webb. That came in the spring of\r\n1851 when he refused to use his political influence as speaker against\r\nHamilton Fish for United States senator and in favour of the owner of\r\nthe _Courier and Enquirer_. His anti-slavery convictions and strong\r\nprejudices against the compromise measures of 1850 also rapidly\r\nwidened the gulf between him and his superior; and when the break\r\nfinally came he stepped from the speaker's chair into the editorial\r\nmanagement of the New York _Times_, his own paper, pure in tone and\r\nreasonable in price, which was destined to weaken the _Courier_ as a\r\npolitical organ, to rival the _Tribune_ as a family and party journal,\r\nand to challenge the _Herald_ as a collector of news.\r\n\r\nThe stormy sessions of the Legislature of 1851 needed such a speaker\r\nas Raymond. At the outset, the scenes and tactics witnessed at\r\nSeward's election to the Senate in 1849 were repeated in the selection\r\nof a successor to Daniel S. Dickinson, whose term expired on the 4th\r\nof March. Webb's candidacy was prosecuted with characteristic zeal.\r\nFor a quarter of a century he had been a picturesque, aggressive\r\njournalist, with a record adorned with libel suits and duels--the\r\nresult of pungent paragraphs and bitter personalities--making him an\r\nobject of terror to the timid and a pistol target for the fearless. On\r\none occasion, through the clemency of Governor Seward, he escaped a\r\ntwo years' term in state's prison for fighting the brilliant \"Tom\"\r\nMarshall of Kentucky, who wounded him in the leg, and it is not\r\nimpossible that Jonathan Cilley might have wounded him in the other\r\nhad not the distinguished Maine congressman refused his challenge\r\nbecause he was \"not a gentleman.\" This reply led to the foolish and\r\nfatal fray between Cilley and William J. Graves, who took up Webb's\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\nWebb was known as the Apollo of the press, his huge form, erect and\r\nmassive, towering above the heads of other men, while his great\r\nphysical strength made him noted for feats of endurance and activity.\r\nAs a young man he held a minor commission in the army, but in 1827, at\r\nthe age of twenty-five, he resigned to become the editor of the\r\n_Courier_, which, in 1829, he combined with the _Enquirer_. For twenty\r\nyears, under his management, this paper, first as a supporter of\r\nJackson and later as an advocate of Whig policies, ranked among the\r\ninfluential journals of New York. After Raymond withdrew, however, it\r\nbecame the organ of the Silver-Grays, and began to wane, until, in\r\n1860, it lapsed into the _World_.\r\n\r\nWebb's chief title to distinction in political life was allegiance to\r\nhis own principles regardless of the party with which he happened to\r\nbe affiliated, and his fidelity to men who had shown him kindness. He\r\nfollowed President Jackson until the latter turned against the United\r\nStates Bank, and he supported the radical Whigs until Clay, in 1849,\r\ndefeated his confirmation for minister to Austria; but, to the last,\r\nhe seems to have remained true to Seward, possibly because Seward kept\r\nhim out of state's prison, although, in the contest for United States\r\nsenator in 1851, Hamilton Fish was the candidate of the Seward Whigs.\r\nFish had grown rapidly as governor. People formerly recognised him as\r\nan accomplished gentleman, modest in manners and moderate in speech,\r\nbut his conduct and messages as an executive revealed those higher\r\nqualities of statesmanship that ranked him among the wisest public men\r\nof the State. Thurlow Weed had accepted rather than selected him for\r\ngovernor in 1848. \"I came here without claims upon your kindness,\"\r\nFish wrote on December 31, 1850, the last day of his term. \"I shall\r\nleave here full of the most grateful recollections of your favours and\r\ngood will.\"[403] This admission was sufficient to dishonour him with\r\nthe Fillmore Whigs, and, although he became the caucus nominee for\r\nsenator on the 30th of January, his opponents, marshalled by Fillmore\r\noffice-holders in support of James Watson Webb, succeeded in\r\ndeadlocking his election for nearly two months.[404]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n190.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: \"The Whigs held the Senate by only two majority, and\r\nwhen the day for electing a United States senator arrived, sixteen\r\nWhigs voted for Fish, and fifteen Democrats voted for as many\r\ndifferent candidates, so that the Fish Whigs could not double over\r\nupon them. James W. Beekman, a Whig senator of New York City, who\r\nclaimed that Fish had fallen too much under the control of Weed, voted\r\nfor Francis Granger. Upon a motion to adjourn, Beekman voted 'yes'\r\nwith the Democrats, creating a tie, which the lieutenant-governor\r\nbroke by also voting in the affirmative. The Whigs then waited for a\r\nfew weeks, but one morning, when two Democrats were in New York City,\r\nthey sprung a resolution to go into an election, and, after an\r\nunbroken struggle of fourteen hours, Fish was elected. The exultant\r\ncannon of the victors startled the city from its slumbers, and\r\nconvinced the Silver-Grays that the Woolly Heads still held the\r\ncapitol.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 172.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, other serious troubles confronted the young speaker.\r\nThe Assembly, pursuant to the recommendation of Governor Hunt, passed\r\nan act authorising a loan of nine million dollars for the immediate\r\nenlargement of the Erie canal. Its constitutionality, seriously\r\ndoubted, was approved by Daniel Webster and Rufus Choate, and the\r\nWhigs, needing an issue for the campaign, forced the bill ahead until\r\neleven Democratic senators broke a quorum by resigning their seats.\r\nThe Whigs were scarcely less excited than the Democrats. Such a\r\nsecession had never occurred before. Former legislators held the\r\nopinion that they were elected to represent and maintain the interests\r\nof their constituents--not to withdraw for the sake of indulging some\r\npetulant or romantic impulse because they could not have their own\r\nway. Two opposition senators had the good sense to take this view and\r\nremain at their post. Governor Hunt immediately called an extra\r\nsession, and, in the campaign to fill the vacancies, six of the eleven\r\nseceders were beaten. Thus reinforced in the Senate, the Whig policy\r\nbecame the law; and, although, the Court of Appeals, in the following\r\nMay, held the act unconstitutional, both parties got the benefit of\r\nthe issue in the campaign of 1851.\r\n\r\nIn this contest the Whigs followed the lead of the Democrats in\r\navoiding the slavery question. The fugitive slave law was absorbing\r\npublic attention. The \"Jerry rescue\" had not occurred in Syracuse; nor\r\nhad the killing of a slave-holder in a negro uprising on the border of\r\nan adjoining State advertised the danger of enforcing the law; yet\r\nthe Act had not worked as smoothly as Fillmore's friends wished. It\r\ntook ten days of litigation at a cost of more than the fugitive's\r\nvalue to reclaim a slave in New York City. Trustworthy estimates fixed\r\nthe number of runaways in the free States at fifteen thousand, and a\r\nsouthern United States senator bitterly complained that only four or\r\nfive had been recaptured since the law's enactment. Enough had been\r\ndone, however, to inflame the people into a passion. Ralph Waldo\r\nEmerson declared the Act \"a law which every one of you will break on\r\nthe earliest occasion--a law which no man can obey, or abet the\r\nobeying, without loss of self-respect and forfeiture of the name of\r\ngentleman.\"[405] Seward did not hesitate to publish similar\r\nsentiments. \"Christendom,\" he wrote, \"might be searched in vain for a\r\nparallel to the provisions which make escape from bondage a crime, and\r\nwhich, under vigorous penalties, compel freemen to aid in the capture\r\nof slaves.\"[406] The Albany _Evening Journal_ declared that \"the\r\nexecution of the fugitive slave law violently convulses the\r\nfoundations of society. Fugitives who have lived among us for many\r\nyears cannot be seized and driven off as if they belonged to the brute\r\ncreation. The attempt to recover such fugitives will prove\r\nabortive.\"[407]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: J.E. Cabot, _Life of Emerson_, p. 578. Emerson's\r\naddress at Concord, May 3, 1851.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n185.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read these expressions without believing that they\r\nwere written under the inspiration of genuine emotion, and that so\r\nlong as such conditions continued men of sentiment could think of\r\nlittle else. Danger to the Union, at least assumed danger, could not\r\nin any way soften their hearts or change their purposes. Yet the state\r\nconventions which met in Syracuse on September 10 and 11, 1851, talked\r\nof other things. The Democrats nominated a ticket divided between\r\nHunkers and Barnburners; and, after condemning the Whig management of\r\nthe canals as lavish, reckless, and corrupt, readopted the slavery\r\nresolutions of the previous year. The Whigs likewise performed their\r\nduty by making up a ticket of Fillmore and inoffensive Seward men,\r\npledging the party to the enlargement of the Erie canal. Thus it was\r\npublicly announced that slavery should be eliminated from the thought\r\nand action of parties.\r\n\r\nThis policy of silence put the Whigs under painful restraint. The\r\nrescue of a fugitive at Syracuse by a band of resolute men, led by\r\nGerrit Smith and Samuel J. May, and the killing of a slave-owner at\r\nChristiana, Pennsylvania, while attempting to reclaim his property,\r\nseriously disturbed the consciences of men who thought as did Emerson\r\nand Seward; but not a word appeared in Whig papers about the great\r\nunderlying question which persistently forced itself on men's\r\nthoughts. Greeley wrote of the tariff and the iron trade; Seward spent\r\nthe summer in Detroit on professional engagements; and Weed, whose\r\ngreat skill had aided in successfully guiding the canal loan through a\r\nlegislative secession, continued to urge that policy as the key to the\r\ncampaign as well as to New York's commerce. But after the votes were\r\ncounted the Whigs discovered that they had played a losing game. Two\r\nminor state officers out of eight, with a tie in the Senate and two\r\nmajority in the Assembly, summed up their possessions. The defeat of\r\nGeorge W. Patterson for comptroller greatly distressed his friends,\r\nand the loss of the canal board, with all its officers, plunged the\r\nwhole Whig party into grief. Several reasons for this unexpected\r\nresult found advocates in the press. There were evidences of\r\ninfidelity in some of the up-state counties, especially in the Auburn\r\ndistrict, where Samuel Blatchford's law partnership with Seward had\r\ndefeated him for justice of the Supreme Court; but the wholesale\r\nproscription in New York City by Administration or \"Cotton Whigs,\" as\r\nthey were called, fully accounted for the overthrow. It was taken as a\r\ndeclaration of war against Sewardism. \"The majorities against\r\nPatterson and his defeated associates,\" said the _Tribune_, in its\r\nissue of November 20, \"imply that no man who is recognised as a\r\nfriend of Governor Seward and a condemner of the fugitive slave law\r\nmust be run on our state ticket hereafter, or he will be beaten by the\r\nCotton influence in this city.\" Hamilton Fish took a similar view. \"A\r\nnoble, glorious party has been defeated--destroyed--by its own\r\nleaders,\" he wrote Weed. \"Webster has succeeded better under Fillmore\r\nthan he did under Tyler in breaking up the Whig organisation and\r\nforming a third party. I pity Fillmore. Timid, vacillating, credulous,\r\nunjustly suspicious when approached by his prejudices, he has allowed\r\nthe sacrifice of that confiding party which has had no honours too\r\nhigh to confer upon him. It cannot be long before he will realise the\r\ntremendous mistake he has made.\"[408]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n196.]\r\n\r\nWhat Hamilton Fish said the great majority of New York Whigs thought,\r\nand in this frame of mind they entered the presidential campaign of\r\n1852. Fillmore, Scott, and Webster were the candidates. Fillmore had\r\nnot spared the use of patronage to further his ambition. It mattered\r\nnot that the postmaster at Albany was the personal friend of Thurlow\r\nWeed, or that the men appointed upon the recommendation of Seward were\r\nthe choice of a majority of their party, the proscription extended to\r\nall who disapproved the Silver-Grays' bolt of 1850, or refused to\r\nrecognise their subsequent convention at Utica. Under these\r\ncircumstances thirst for revenge as well as a desire to nominate a\r\nwinning candidate controlled the selection of presidential delegates;\r\nand in the round-up seven favoured Fillmore, two preferred Webster,\r\nwhile twenty-four supported Scott. Naturally the result was a great\r\nshock to Fillmore. The Silver-Grays had been growing heartily sick of\r\ntheir secession, and if they needed further evidence of its rashness\r\nthe weakness of their leader in his home State furnished it.\r\n\r\nFillmore's strength proved to be chiefly in the South. His vigorous\r\nexecution of the fugitive slave law had been more potent than his\r\nunsparing use of patronage; and when the Whig convention assembled at\r\nBaltimore on June 16 the question whether that law should be declared\r\na finality became of supreme importance. Fillmore could not stand on\r\nan anti-slavery platform, and a majority of the New Yorkers refused\r\ntheir consent to any sacrifice of principle. But, in spite of their\r\nprotest, the influence of a solid southern delegation, backed by the\r\nmarvellous eloquence of Rufus Choate, forced the passage of a\r\nresolution declaring that \"the compromise acts, the act known as the\r\nfugitive slave law included, are received and acquiesced in by the\r\nWhig party of the United States as a settlement in principle and\r\nsubstance of the dangerous and exciting questions which they embrace.\r\nWe insist upon their strict enforcement; and we deprecate all further\r\nagitation of the question thus settled, as dangerous to our peace, and\r\nwill discountenance all efforts to continue or renew such agitation\r\nwhenever, wherever, or however the attempt may be made.\" A roll call\r\ndeveloped sixty-six votes in the negative, all from the North, and\r\none-third of them from New York.\r\n\r\nThis was a Fillmore-Webster platform, and the first ballot gave them a\r\nmajority of the votes cast, Fillmore having 133, Webster 29, Scott\r\n131. The number necessary to a choice was 147. The activity of the\r\nFillmore delegates, therefore, centred in an effort to concentrate the\r\nvotes of the President and his secretary of state. Both were in\r\nWashington, their relations were cordial, and an adjournment of the\r\nconvention over Sunday gave abundant opportunity to negotiate. When it\r\nbecame manifest that Webster's friends would not go to Fillmore, an\r\nextraordinary effort was made to bring the President's votes to\r\nWebster. This was agreeable to Fillmore, who placed a letter of\r\nwithdrawal in the hands of a Buffalo delegate to be used whenever he\r\ndeemed it proper. But twenty-two Southern men declined to be\r\ntransferred, while the most piteous appeals to the Scott men of New\r\nYork met with cold refusals. They professed any amount of duty to\r\ntheir party, but as regards the Fillmore combine they were implacable.\r\nThey would listen to no terms of compromise while their great enemy\r\nremained in the field. Meantime, the Scott managers had not been\r\nasleep. In the contest over the platform, certain Southern delegates\r\nhad agreed to vote for Scott whenever Fillmore reached his finish,\r\nprovided Scott's friends supported the fugitive slave plank; and these\r\ndelegates, amidst the wildest excitement, now began changing their\r\nvotes to the hero of Lundy's Lane. On the fifty-third ballot, the\r\nsoldier had twenty-six majority, the vote standing: Scott, 159;\r\nFillmore, 112; Webster, 21.\r\n\r\nThe prophecy of Hamilton Fish was fulfilled. Fillmore now realised, if\r\nnever before, \"the tremendous mistakes he had made.\" Upon his election\r\nas Vice President, and especially after dreams of the White House\r\nbegan to dazzle him, he seemed to sacrifice old friends and cherished\r\nprinciples without a scruple. Until then, the Buffalo statesman had\r\nbeen as pronounced upon the slavery question as Seward; and after he\r\nbecame President, with the tremendous influence of Daniel Webster\r\ndriving him on, it was not believed that he would violate the\r\nprinciples of a lifetime by approving a fugitive slave law, revolting\r\nto the rapidly growing sentiment of justice and humanity toward the\r\nslave. But, unlike Webster, the President manifested no feeling of\r\nchagrin or disappointment over the result at Baltimore. Throughout the\r\ncampaign and during the balance of his term of office he bore himself\r\nwith courage and with dignity. Indeed, his equanimity seemed almost\r\nlike the fortitude of fatalism. No doubt, he was sustained by the\r\nconviction that the compromise measures had avoided civil war, and by\r\nthe feeling that if he had erred, Clay and Webster had likewise erred;\r\nbut he could have had no presentiment of the depth of the retirement\r\nto which he was destined. He was to reappear, in 1856, as a\r\npresidential candidate of the Americans; and, after civil war had rent\r\nthe country in twain, his sympathy for the Union was to reveal itself\r\nearly and with ardour. But the fugitive slave law, which, next to\r\ntreason itself, had become the most offensive act during the ante-war\r\ncrisis, filled the minds of men with a growing dislike of the one\r\nwhose pen gave it life, and, in spite of his high character, his long\r\npublic career, and his eminence as a citizen, he was associated with\r\nPierce and Buchanan, who, as Northern men, were believed to have\r\nsurrendered to Southern dictation.[409]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: \"When Fillmore withdrew from the presidential office,\r\nthe general sentiment proclaimed that he had filled the place with\r\nability and honour. He was strictly temperate, industrious, orderly,\r\nand of an integrity above suspicion. If Northern people did not\r\napprove the fugitive slave law, they at least looked upon it with\r\ntoleration. It is quite true, however, that after-opinion has been\r\nunkind to Fillmore. The judgment on him was made up at a time when the\r\nfugitive slave law had become detestable, and he was remembered only\r\nfor his signature and vigorous execution of it.\"--James F. Rhodes,\r\n_History of the United States_, Vol. 1, pp. 297, 301.]\r\n\r\nIn the national convention at Baltimore, which met June 1, 1852, the\r\nNew York Democrats were likewise destined to suffer by their\r\ndivisions. Lewis Cass, James Buchanan, and Stephen A. Douglas were the\r\nleading candidates; though William L. Marcy and Daniel S. Dickinson\r\nalso had presidential ambitions. Marcy was a man of different mould\r\nfrom Dickinson.[410] With great mental resources, rare administrative\r\nability, consummate capacity in undermining enemies, and an intuitive\r\nsagacity in the selection of friends, Marcy was an opponent to be\r\ndreaded. After the experiences of 1847 and 1848, he had bitterly\r\ndenounced the Barnburners, refusing even to join Seymour in 1849 in\r\nhis heroic efforts to reunite the party; but when the Barnburners,\r\ninfluenced by the Utica statesman, began talking of him for President\r\nin 1852 he quickly put himself in accord with that wing of his party.\r\nInstantly, this became a call to battle. The Hunkers, provoked at his\r\napostacy and encouraged by the continued distrust of many Barnburners,\r\nmade a desperate effort, under the leadership of Dickinson, to secure\r\na majority of the delegates for Cass. The plastic hand of Horatio\r\nSeymour, however, quickly kneaded the doubting Barnburners into Marcy\r\nadvocates; and when the contest ended the New York delegation stood\r\ntwenty-three for Marcy and thirteen for Cass.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: \"It was certain that Mr. Dickinson could not carry New\r\nYork.... Governor Marcy was strongly urged in many quarters, and it\r\nwas thought the State might be carried by him; but many were of the\r\nopinion that his friends kept his name prominently before the public\r\nwith the hope of obtaining a cabinet appointment for him and thus\r\nsecuring the influence of that section of the New York Democracy to\r\nwhich he belonged. This was precisely the result that followed.\"--Morgan\r\nDix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 1, p. 266.]\r\n\r\nDickinson, who had been a steadfast friend of the South, relied with\r\nconfidence upon Virginia and other Southern States whenever success\r\nwith Cass seemed impossible. On the other hand, Marcy expected a\r\ntransfer of support from Buchanan and Douglas if the break came. On\r\nthe first ballot Cass had 116, Buchanan 93, Douglas 20, and Marcy 27;\r\nnecessary to a choice, 188. As chairman of the New York delegation,\r\nHoratio Seymour held Marcy's vote practically intact through\r\nthirty-three ballots; but, on the thirty-fourth, he dropped to 23, and\r\nVirginia cast its fifteen votes for Dickinson, who, up to that time,\r\nhad been honoured only with the vote of a solitary delegate. In the\r\nmidst of some applause, the New Yorker, who was himself a delegate,\r\nthanked his Virginia friends for the compliment, but declared that his\r\nadherence to Cass could not be shaken.[411] Dickinson had carefully\r\narranged for this vote. The day before, in the presence of the\r\nVirginia delegation, he had asked Henry B. Stanton's opinion of his\r\nability to carry New York. \"You or Marcy or any man nominated can\r\ncarry New York,\" was the laconic reply. Dickinson followed Stanton out\r\nof the room to thank him for his courtesy, but regretted he did not\r\nconfine his answer to him alone. After Virginia's vote Dickinson again\r\nsought Stanton's opinion as to its adherence. \"It is simply a\r\ncompliment,\" was the reply, \"and will leave you on the next ballot,\"\r\nwhich it did, going to Franklin Pierce. \"Dickinson's friends used to\r\nassert,\" continued Stanton, \"that he threw away the Presidency on this\r\noccasion. I happened to know better. He never stood for a moment where\r\nhe could control the Virginia vote--the hinge whereon all was to\r\nturn.\"[412]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: \"I could not consent to a nomination here without\r\nincurring the imputation of unfaithfully executing the trust committed\r\nto me by my constituents--without turning my back on an old and valued\r\nfriend. Nothing that could be offered me--not even the highest\r\nposition in the Government, the office of President of the United\r\nStates--could compensate me for such a desertion of my trust.\"--Daniel\r\nS. Dickinson, _Letters and Speeches_, Vol. 1, p. 370.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 181.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Marcy moved up to 44. It had been evident for two days\r\nthat the favourite candidates could not win, and for the next thirteen\r\nballots, amidst the greatest noise and confusion, the convention\r\nsought to discover the wisest course to pursue. Seymour endeavoured to\r\nside-track the \"dark horse\" movement by turning the tide to Marcy,\r\nwhose vote kept steadily rising. When, on the forty-fifth ballot, he\r\nreached 97, the New York delegation retired for consultation. Seymour\r\nat once moved that the State vote solidly for Marcy; but protests fell\r\nso thick, exploding like bombshells, that he soon withdrew the motion.\r\nThis ended Marcy's chances.[413] On the forty-ninth ballot, North\r\nCarolina started the stampede to Pierce, who received 282 votes to 6\r\nfor all others. Later in the day, the convention nominated William R.\r\nKing of Alabama for Vice President, and adopted a platform, declaring\r\nthat \"the Democratic party of the Union will abide by, and adhere to,\r\na faithful execution of the acts known as the compromise measures\r\nsettled by the last Congress--the act for reclaiming fugitive slaves\r\nfrom service of labour included; which act, being designed to carry\r\nout an express provision of the Constitution, cannot with fidelity\r\nthereto be repealed, nor so changed as to destroy or impair its\r\nefficiency.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 413: \"Marcy held the war portfolio under Polk, but his\r\nconduct of the office had not added to his reputation, for it had\r\ngalled the Administration to have the signal victories of the Mexican\r\nWar won by Whig generals, and it was currently believed that the War\r\nMinister had shared in the endeavour to thwart some of the plans of\r\nScott and Taylor.\"--James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_,\r\nVol. 1, pp. 246-7.\r\n\r\n\"The conflict became terrific, until, when the ballots had run up to\r\nwithin one of fifty, the Virginia nominee was announced as the choice\r\nof the convention.\"--Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n268.]\r\n\r\nSome time before the convention it was suggested, with Marcy's\r\napproval, that the New York delegation should vote as a unit for\r\nDickinson if he proved the stronger candidate outside the State, and,\r\nupon the same condition, a solid delegation should vote for Marcy.\r\nThis proposition did not reach Dickinson until his leading friends had\r\ncommitted themselves by a second choice; but, in speaking of the\r\nmatter to Thurlow Weed ten years afterward, Dickinson said that had it\r\ncome in time he would cheerfully have accepted it, adding that\r\nwhatever may have been his opinion in 1852, he now knew it would have\r\nresulted in Marcy's nomination.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance among the New York delegates at Baltimore had its\r\ninfluence at Syracuse when the Democratic state convention assembled\r\non September 1. Seymour was the leading candidate for governor, and\r\nDickinson opposed him with a bitterness born of a desire for revenge.\r\nThe night before the convention Seymour's chances were pronounced\r\ndesperate. Whatever disappointments had come at Baltimore were laid at\r\nhis door. Seymour made Cass' defeat possible; Seymour refused to help\r\nBuchanan; Seymour was responsible for a dark horse; Seymour filled\r\nMarcy's friends with hopes of ultimate victory, only to heighten their\r\ndisappointment in the end. All these allegations were merely founded\r\nupon his steadfastness to Marcy, and he might have answered that\r\neverything had been done with the approval of a majority of the New\r\nYork delegation. But Dickinson was no match for the Utica statesman.\r\nSeymour's whole life had been a training for such a contest. As Roscoe\r\nConkling said of him many years later, he had sat at the feet of Edwin\r\nCroswell and measured swords with Thurlow Weed. He was one of the men\r\nwho do not lose the character of good fighters because they are\r\nexcellent negotiators. Even the cool-headed and astute John Van Buren,\r\nwho joined Dickinson in his support of John P. Beekman of New York\r\nCity for governor, found that Seymour could cut deeply when he chose\r\nto wield a blade.[414] Seymour, moreover, gave his friends great\r\nsatisfaction by the energy with which he entered the gubernatorial\r\ncontest. When the first ballot was announced he had 59 votes to\r\nBeekman's 7, with only 64 necessary to a choice. On the second ballot,\r\nthe Utican had 78 and Beekman 3. This concluded the convention's\r\ncontest. Sanford E. Church was then renominated for lieutenant-governor,\r\nand the Baltimore platform approved.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 414: \"Seymour was among the most effective and eloquent\r\nplatform orators in New York. Less electrical than John Van Buren, he\r\nwas more persuasive; less witty, he was more logical; less sarcastic,\r\nhe was more candid; less denunciatory of antagonists, he was more\r\nconvincing to opponents. These two remarkable men had little in common\r\nexcept lofty ambition and rare mental and social gifts. Their salient\r\ncharacteristics were widely dissimilar. Seymour was conciliatory, and\r\ncultivated peace. Van Buren was aggressive, and coveted war.\"--H.B.\r\nStanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 178.]\r\n\r\nThe Whig state convention met at Syracuse on September 22 and promptly\r\nrenominated Washington Hunt for governor by acclamation. Raymond\r\nwanted it, and Greeley, in a letter to Weed, admitted an ambition,\r\nwhile a strong sentiment existed for George W. Patterson. Hunt had\r\nveered toward Fillmore's way of thinking. \"The closing paragraphs of\r\nhis message are a beggarly petition to the South,\" wrote George\r\nDawson, the quaint, forceful associate of Weed upon the _Evening\r\nJournal_.[415] But Hunt's administration had been quiet and\r\nsatisfactory, and there was little disposition to drop him. He did not\r\nhave the patience of Hamilton Fish, but he resembled him in moderation\r\nof speech.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 415: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n218.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Kent, a son of the Chancellor, received the nomination for\r\nlieutenant-governor. Kent was a scholarly, able lawyer. He had served\r\nfive years upon the circuit bench by appointment of Governor Seward.\r\nHe co-operated with Benjamin F. Butler in the organisation of the law\r\nschool of the New York University, becoming one of its original\r\nlecturers, and was subsequently called to Harvard as a professor of\r\nlaw. Like his distinguished father he was a man of pure character, and\r\nof singular simplicity and gentleness.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of a platform gave the Whig delegates more trouble than\r\nthe nomination of candidates. A large majority opposed the slavery\r\nplank of the Baltimore platform. But the Seward Whigs, having little\r\nfaith in the ultimate result, accepted a general declaration that \"an\r\nhonest acquiescence in the action of the late national convention upon\r\nall subjects legitimately before it is the duty of every Whig.\" Horace\r\nGreeley suggested that \"those who please can construe this concession\r\ninto an approval.\"\r\n\r\nIn opening the canvass of 1852, the Whigs attempted to repeat the\r\ncampaign of 1840. Scott's record in the War of 1812 was not less\r\nbrilliant than Harrison's, and if his Mexican battles were not fought\r\nagainst the overwhelming odds that Taylor met at Buena Vista, he was\r\nnone the less entitled to the distinction of a conqueror. It was\r\nthought proper, therefore, to start his political campaign where his\r\nmilitary career began, and, as the anniversary of Lundy's Lane\r\noccurred in July, extensive preparations were made for celebrating the\r\nday at Niagara Falls, the nearest American point to the scene of his\r\ndesperate courage. The great meeting, made up of large delegations\r\nfrom nearly every Northern State, rivalled in numbers and in\r\nenthusiasm the memorable meetings of the Harrison campaign. To add to\r\nthe interest, two hundred and twenty officers and soldiers of the War\r\nof 1812, some of whom had taken part in the battle, participated in\r\nthe festivities. Speakers declared that it inaugurated a new career of\r\ntriumph, which might be likened to the onslaught of Lundy's Lane, the\r\nconflict of Chippewa, the siege of Vera Cruz, and the storm of Cerro\r\nGordo; and which, they prophesied, would end in triumphant possession,\r\nnot now of the Halls of the Montezumas, but of the White House of\r\nAmerican Presidents. The meeting lasted two days. Thomas Ewing, of\r\nOhio, acted as president, and among the speakers was Henry Winter\r\nDavis.\r\n\r\nBut this was the only demonstration that recalled the Harrison\r\ncampaign. The drum and cannon did conspicuous work, flags floated, and\r\nspeakers found ready and patriotic listeners, but the hearts of many\r\npeople were not enlisted in the discussion of tariffs and public\r\nimprovements. They were thinking of the fugitive slave law and its\r\nenforcement, and some believed that while speakers and editors were\r\ncharging Pierce with cowardice on the field of Churubusco they did not\r\nthemselves have the courage to voice their honest convictions on the\r\nslavery question. As election drew near signs of victory disappeared.\r\nConservative Whigs did not like the candidate and anti-slavery Whigs\r\nobjected to the platform. \"This wretched platform,\" Seward declared,\r\n\"was contrived to defeat Scott in the nomination, or to sink him in\r\nthe canvass.\"[416] Horace Greeley's spirited protest against the\r\nfugitive slave plank gave rise to the phrase, \"We accept the\r\ncandidate, but spit upon the platform.\" Among the business men of New\r\nYork City an impression obtained that if Scott became President,\r\nSeward would control him; and their purpose to crush the soldier\r\nseemed to centre not so much in hostility to Scott as in their desire\r\nto destroy Seward. Greeley speaks of this \"extraordinary feature\" of\r\nthe campaign. \"Seward has been the burden of our adversaries' song\r\nfrom the outset,\" he writes; \"and mercantile Whigs by thousands have\r\never been ready not merely to defeat but to annihilate the Whig party\r\nif they might thereby demolish Seward.\"[417] In answer to the charge\r\nof influencing Scott's administration, the Senator promptly declared\r\nthat he would neither ask nor accept \"any public station or preferment\r\nwhatever at the hands of the President.\"[418] But this in nowise\r\nsilenced their batteries. To the end of the canvass Scott continued to\r\nbe advertised as the \"Seward candidate.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 188.\r\n\r\n\"Many thought: the voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands\r\nof Esau. Seward was the political juggler, or Mephistopheles, as some\r\ncalled him, and the result was regarded as his triumph.\"--James F.\r\nRhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. 1, p. 262. \"Some of the\r\nprominent Whig newspapers of Georgia declined to sustain Scott,\r\nbecause his election would mean Free-soilism and Sewardism. An address\r\nwas issued on July 3 by Alexander H. Stephens, Robert Toombs, and five\r\nother Whig representatives, in which they flatly refused to support\r\nScott because he was 'the favourite candidate of the Free Soil wing of\r\nthe Whig party.'\"--_Ibid._, p. 262.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: New York _Tribune_, October, 1852.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: _Seward's Works_, Vol. 3, p. 416. Date of letter, June\r\n26, 1852.]\r\n\r\nAfter the September elections, it became manifest that something must\r\nbe done to strengthen Whig sentiment, and Scott made a trip through\r\nthe doubtful States of Ohio and New York. Although Harrison had made\r\nseveral speeches in 1840, there was no precedent for a presidential\r\nstumping tour; and, to veil the purpose of the journey, recourse was\r\nhad to a statute authorising the general of the army to visit Kentucky\r\nwith the object of locating an asylum for sick and disabled soldiers\r\nat Blue Lick Springs. He went from Washington by way of Pittsburg and\r\nreturned through New York, stopping at Buffalo, Niagara Falls,\r\nLockport, Rochester, Auburn, Syracuse, Rome, Utica, and Albany.\r\nEverywhere great crowds met him, but cheers for the hero mingled with\r\ncheers for a Democratic victory in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana,\r\nindicating the certain election of Pierce in November. At Auburn,\r\nSeward referred to him as \"the greatest of American heroes since the\r\nRevolutionary age.\" At Albany, John C. Spencer's presence recalled the\r\ndistinguished services of Governor Tompkins and Chief Justice Ambrose\r\nSpencer in the War of 1812. \"It was these men,\" said Scott, \"who were\r\naware of the position on the frontier, that urged me on to achieve\r\nsomething that would add to the future honour of our country.\" New\r\nYork City received him with one of the largest ovations ever witnessed\r\nup to that time. He avoided politics in his speeches, insisting that\r\nhe did not come to solicit votes. But he did not thereby help his\r\ncause or escape ridicule. Indeed, the ill-advised things said and\r\ndone, created the impression that obtained thirty-two years later\r\nafter the tour of James G. Blaine.\r\n\r\nThough the Democrats at first accepted Franklin Pierce as they had\r\nreceived James K. Polk, coldness and distrust gradually disappeared.\r\nAt Tammany's Fourth of July celebration, the presence of the prominent\r\nleaders who bolted in 1848 gave evidence of the party's reunion. The\r\nchief speaker was John Van Buren. Upon the platform sat John A. Dix,\r\nPreston King, and Churchill C. Cambreling. Of the letters read, one\r\ncame from Martin Van Buren, who expressed pleasure that \"the\r\ndisturbing subject of slavery has, by the action of both the great\r\nparties of the country, been withdrawn from the canvass.\" Among the\r\neditors who contributed most powerfully to the Free-soil movement,\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant now supported Pierce on the theory that he and\r\nthe platform were the more favourable to freedom.[419] John Van\r\nBuren's spacious mind and his genius for giving fascination to\r\nwhatever he said convulsed his audience with wit and thrilled it with\r\nforceful statements. The country, he declared, was tired of the\r\nagitation of slavery, which had ceased to be a political question. It\r\nonly remained to enforce in good faith the great compromise. He\r\nasserted that trade was good and the country prosperous, and that the\r\nDemocratic party had gained the confidence of the people because it\r\nwas a party of pacification, opposed to the agitation of slavery,\r\ninsistent upon sacredly observing the compromises of the Constitution,\r\nand certain to bring settled political conditions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 419: \"The argument of the _Post_, that the Democratic\r\ncandidate and platform were really more favourable to liberty than the\r\nWhig, was somewhat strained; the editor failed to look the situation\r\nsquarely in the face. He was, however, acting in perfect harmony with\r\nthe prominent New York Democrats who had, four years previously,\r\nbolted the regular nomination. Salmon P. Chase, although still a\r\nDemocrat, would not support Pierce, but gave his adherence to the\r\nFree-soil nominations, and tried hard, though in vain, to bring to\r\ntheir support his former New York associates.\"--James F. Rhodes,\r\n_History of the United States_, Vol. 1, pp. 264-65.]\r\n\r\nPrince John proved himself equal to the occasion. If no longer the\r\ngreat apostle of the Free-soilers he was now the accepted champion of\r\nthe Democracy. He had said what everybody believed who voted for\r\nPierce and what many people thought who voted for Scott. There is no\r\ndoubt his speech created an immense sensation. Greeley ridiculed it,\r\nWeed belittled it, and the Free-soilers denounced it, but it became\r\nthe keynote of the campaign, and the Prince, with his rich, brilliant\r\ncopiousness that was never redundant, became the picturesque and\r\npopular speaker of every platform. There were other Democratic\r\norators.[420] Charles O'Conor's speeches were masterpieces of\r\ndeclamation, and James T. Brady, then thirty-seven years old, but\r\nalready famous as one of the foremost criminal lawyers of the time,\r\ndiscovered the same magnetic eloquence that made him almost\r\nirresistible before a jury. His sentences, rounded and polished,\r\nrolled from his mouth in perfect balance. Van Buren was kaleidoscopic,\r\nbecoming by turn humourous, sarcastic, gravely logical, and famously\r\nwitty; Brady and O'Conor inclined to severity, easily dropping into\r\nvituperation, and at times exhibiting bitterness. Van Buren's hardest\r\nhits came in the form of sarcasm. It mattered not who heard him, all\r\nwent away good-natured and satisfied with the entertainment. There\r\nwere moments when laughter drowned his loudest utterances, when\r\nsilence made his whispers audible, and when an eloquent epigram\r\nmoistened the eye.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 420: John A. Dix spoke in the New England and the Middle\r\nStates. From October 11 to 29 he made thirteen speeches \"in the great\r\ncanvass which is upon us.\"--Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol.\r\n1, pp. 269, 271.]\r\n\r\nThe election proved a Waterloo to the Whigs. Twenty-seven States gave\r\nmajorities for Pierce, only four were for Scott. Seymour ran 22,000\r\nvotes ahead of Hunt.[421] In the Assembly the Democrats numbered\r\neighty-five, the Whigs forty-three. Of the thirty-three congressmen,\r\nthe Democrats elected twenty-one, the Whigs ten, the Free-soilers and\r\nLand Reformers one each. It was wittily said that the Whig party \"died\r\nof an attempt to swallow the fugitive slave law.\" The election of\r\nPierce and Seymour surprised none of the Whig leaders. Thurlow Weed,\r\nconvinced of the hopelessness of Whig success, went off to Europe for\r\nsix months preceding the campaign. The _Tribune_ talked of victory,\r\nbut in his private correspondence Greeley declared that \"we shall lose\r\nthe Legislature and probably everything at home.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 421: Horatio Seymour, 264,121; Washington Hunt,\r\n241,525.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nWinfield Scott seems to have been the only man really surprised. \"He\r\nlooked forward buoyantly to an easy and triumphant victory,\" says\r\nWeed, who dined with him on a Sunday in October.[422] But, though\r\nPierce's election produced no surprise, his majority of 212 electoral\r\nvotes astounded everybody. It eclipsed the result of the romantic\r\ncampaign of 1840, and seemed to verify the assertions of John Van\r\nBuren, in his Fourth of July speech at Tammany Hall. The people were\r\nnot only tired of slavery agitation, but trade was good, the country\r\nprosperous, and a reunited Democracy, by unreservedly indorsing the\r\ncompromise measures of 1850, promised settled conditions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 422: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n219.]\r\n\r\nIt is not without historical interest to notice that Gerrit Smith, one\r\nof the most uncompromising opponents of slavery in any country,\r\nreceived an election to Congress in a district that gave Pierce and\r\nSeymour upward of one thousand majority. It showed that the\r\nsmouldering fire, which had suddenly blazed out in the Free-soil\r\ncampaign of 1848, was not extinguished by the coalition of Barnburners\r\nand Hunkers, and the acceptance of the great compromise by the two\r\nBaltimore conventions. Gerrit Smith was a noble example of the\r\nchampions of freedom. He had not the passion of Garrison, or the\r\ngenius of Henry Ward Beecher; but his deep voice of marvellous\r\nrichness, the grace and dignity of his person, and the calm, gentle,\r\ndispassionate tone in which he declared his principles without fear,\r\nwas to command the earnest and respectful attention of the national\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE HARDS AND THE SOFTS\r\n\r\n1853\r\n\r\n\r\nIn New York a Democratic victory had come to mean a succession of\r\nDemocratic defeats. It was so after the victory of 1844; and it was\r\ndestined to be so after the victory of 1852. But defeat occurred\r\ndifferently this time. In 1847 the Barnburners had seceded from the\r\nHunkers; in 1853 the Hunkers seceded from the Barnburners. For six\r\nyears the Barnburners had played bold politics. After defeating the\r\nDemocratic ticket in 1847 and the state and national tickets in 1848,\r\nthey returned to the party practically upon their own terms. Instead\r\nof asking admittance they walked in without knocking. They did not\r\neven apologise for their Free-soil principles. These they left behind\r\nbecause they had put them off; but the sorrow that follows repentance\r\nwas absent. In the convention of 1849, John Van Buren was received\r\nlike a prodigal son and his followers invited to an equal division of\r\nthe spoils. Had the Hunkers declared they didn't know them as\r\nDemocrats in their unrepentant attitude, the Barnburner host must have\r\nmelted like frost work; but, in their desire to return to power, the\r\nHunkers asked no questions and fixed no conditions. In the process of\r\nthis reunion Horatio Seymour, the cleverest of the Hunkers, coalesced\r\nwith the shrewdest of the Barnburners, who set about to capture\r\nWilliam L. Marcy. Seymour knew of Marcy's ambition to become a\r\ncandidate for the Presidency and of the rivalry of Cass and Dickinson;\r\nand so when he agreed to make him the Barnburners' candidate, Marcy\r\ncovenanted to defeat Cass at Baltimore and Dickinson in New York.\r\nThough the Barnburners failed to make Marcy a nominee for President,\r\nhe did not fail to defeat Cass and slaughter Dickinson.[423]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 423: \"Seymour resisted the Barnburner revolt of 1847, and\r\nsupported Cass for President in 1848. But he warmly espoused the\r\nmovement to reunite the party the next year. He was in advance of\r\nMarcy in that direction. Seymour pushed forward, while Marcy hung\r\nback. Seymour rather liked the Barnburners, except John Van Buren, of\r\nwhom he was quite jealous and somewhat afraid. But Marcy, after the\r\nexperiences of 1847 and 1848, denounced them in hard terms, until\r\nSeymour and the Free-soil Democrats began talking of him for President\r\nin 1852, when the wily old Regency tactician mellowed toward them.\r\nNothing was wanted to carry Marcy clear over except the hostility of\r\nDickinson, who stood in his way to the White House. This he soon\r\nencountered, which reconciled him to the Barnburners.\"--H.B. Stanton,\r\n_Random Recollections_, p. 177.]\r\n\r\nTo add to the Hunkers' humiliation, President Pierce now sided with\r\nthe Barnburners. He invited John A. Dix to visit him at Concord, and\r\nin the most cordial manner offered him the position of secretary of\r\nstate.[424] This was too much for the pro-slavery Hunkers, for Dix had\r\nbeen a Free-soil candidate for governor in 1848; and the notes of\r\ndefiance compelled the Concord statesman to send for Dix again, who\r\ngraciously relieved him of his embarrassment.[425] Then the President\r\nturned to William L. Marcy, whose return from Florida was coincident\r\nwith the intrigue against Dix. The former secretary of war had not\r\nmustered with the Free-soilers, but his attitude at Baltimore made him\r\n_persona non grata_ to Dickinson. This kept Pierce in trouble. He\r\nwanted a New Yorker, but he wanted peace, and so he delayed action\r\nuntil the day after his inauguration.[426] When it proved to be\r\nMarcy, with Dix promised the mission to France,[427] and Dickinson\r\noffered nothing better than the collectorship of the port of New York,\r\nthe Hunkers waited for an opportunity to make their resentment felt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 424: Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 1, p. 271.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 425: _Ibid._, Vol. 1, p. 272.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 426: \"To satisfy the greatest number was the aim of the\r\nPresident, to whom this problem became the subject of serious thoughts\r\nand many councils; and although the whole Cabinet, as finally\r\nannounced, was published in the newspapers one week before the\r\ninauguration, Pierce did not really decide who should be secretary of\r\nstate until he had actually been one day in office, for up to the\r\nmorning of March 5, that portfolio had not been offered to\r\nMarcy.\"--James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n389.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 427: \"The President offered Dix the mission to France. The\r\ntime fixed was early in the summer of that year. Meanwhile passage was\r\ntaken for Havre, preparations for a four years' residence abroad were\r\nmade, and every arrangement was completed which an anticipated absence\r\nfrom home renders necessary. But political intrigue was instantly\r\nresumed, and again with complete success. The opposition now came, or\r\nappears to have come, mainly from certain Southern politicians.\r\nCharges were made--such, for example, as this: that General Dix was an\r\nAbolitionist, and that the Administration would be untrue to the South\r\nby allowing a man of that extreme and fanatical party to represent it\r\nabroad.... But though these insinuations were repelled, the influence\r\nwas too strong to be resisted. In fact, the place was wanted for an\r\neminent gentleman from Virginia.\"--Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A.\r\nDix_, Vol. 1, pp. 273, 274, 275.]\r\n\r\nThis was the situation when the Democratic state convention met at\r\nSyracuse on September 13, 1853, with thirty-six contested seats. The\r\nfaction that won these would legally control the convention. When the\r\ndoors opened, therefore, an eager crowd, amidst the wildest confusion\r\nand uproar, took possession of the hall, and, with mingled cheers and\r\nhisses, two chairmen were quickly nominated, declared elected, and\r\nforced upon the platform. Each chairman presided. Two conventions\r\noccupied one room; and that one faction might have peaceable\r\npossession it tried to put the other out. Finally, when out of breath\r\nand out of patience, both factions agreed to submit the contest for\r\nseats to a vote of the convention; and while the roll was being\r\nprepared the riotous proceedings were adjourned until four o'clock.\r\nBut the Hunkers had seen and heard enough. It was evident the\r\nBarnburners proposed organising the convention after the tactics of\r\nthe Hunkers in 1847; and, instead of returning to the hall, the\r\nHunkers went elsewhere, organising a convention with eighty-one\r\ndelegates, including the contestants. Here everything was done in\r\norder and with dispatch. Committees on permanent officers,\r\nresolutions, and nominations made unanimous reports to a unanimous\r\nconvention, speeches were vociferously applauded, and the conduct of\r\nthe Barnburners fiercely condemned. Governor Willard of Indiana, who\r\nhappened to be present, declared, in a thrilling speech, that a\r\n\"bully\" stood ready to shoot down the Hunker chairman as he tried to\r\ncall the convention to order. One of the delegates said he thought his\r\nlife was in danger as he saw a man with an axe under his arm. But in\r\ntheir hall of refuge no one appeared to molest them; and by six\r\no'clock the convention had completed its work and adjourned. Among\r\nthose nominated for office appeared the names of George W. Clinton of\r\nBuffalo, the distinguished son of DeWitt Clinton, for secretary of\r\nstate, and James T. Brady, the brilliant lawyer of New York City, for\r\nattorney-general. The resolutions indorsed the Baltimore platform,\r\napproved the President's inaugural on slavery, commended the amendment\r\nto the Constitution appropriating ten and a half million dollars for\r\nthe enlargement and completion of the canals, and complimented Daniel\r\nS. Dickinson.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Barnburners, having reassembled at four o'clock with\r\neighty-seven delegates, sent word to the Hunkers that the convention\r\nwas in session and prepared to organise. To this the chairman replied:\r\n\"We do not consider ourselves in safety in an assemblage controlled\r\nand overawed by bullies, imported for that purpose.\" The Barnburners\r\nlaughed, but in order to give the Hunkers time to sleep over it John\r\nVan Buren opposed further proceedings until the next day. In the\r\nevening, Horatio Seymour, now the Governor, met the convention leaders\r\nand with them laid out the morrow's work.\r\n\r\nWhen Seymour began co-operating with the Barnburners, ambition\r\nprompted him to modify his original canal views so far as to oppose\r\nthe Whig law authorising a loan of nine million dollars to enlarge the\r\nErie canal. But after his election as governor, he recognised that no\r\nparty could successfully appeal to the people in November, 1853,\r\nweighted with such a policy; and with courage and genius for\r\ndiplomatic negotiations, he faced the prejudices which had\r\ncharacterised the Barnburners during their entire history by favouring\r\na constitutional amendment appropriating ten and a half millions for\r\nthe enlargement of the Erie and the completion of the lateral canals.\r\nHe had displayed a bold hand. The help of the Barnburners was needed\r\nto carry the amendment; and when the regular session expired without\r\nthe accomplishment of his purpose Seymour quickly called an extra\r\nsession. Even this dragged into the summer. Finally, in June, to the\r\namazement of the people, the amendment passed and was approved. It was\r\nthis work, which had so brilliantly inaugurated his administration,\r\nthat Seymour desired indorsed, and, although it was morning, and not\r\nvery early morning, before the labour of the night ended, it was\r\nagreed to adopt a canal resolution similar to that of the Hunkers and\r\nto indorse the Governor's administration, a compliment which the\r\nHunkers carefully avoided.\r\n\r\nAfter the settlement of the canal question, the work of the convention\r\nwas practically done. A majority of the candidates were taken from the\r\nsupporters of Cass in 1848, and included Charles H. Ruggles of\r\nPoughkeepsie, and Hiram Denio of Utica, whom the Hunkers had nominated\r\nfor judges of the Court of Appeals. Ruggles was the wise chairman of\r\nthe judiciary committee in the constitutional convention of 1846, and\r\nhad been a member of the Court of Appeals since 1851. Denio was\r\ndestined to become one of the eminent judges of the State. He was not\r\nalways kind in his methods. Indeed, it may be said that he was one of\r\nthose upright judges who contrived to make neither honour nor\r\nrectitude seem lovable qualities; yet his abilities finally earned him\r\nan enviable reputation as a justice of New York's court of last\r\nresort.\r\n\r\nThe factions differed little in men or in principle, and not at all\r\nupon the question of slavery. Two conventions were, therefore,\r\nabsolutely unnecessary except upon the theory that the Hunkers, having\r\nlittle to gain and nothing to lose, desired to embarrass the\r\nadministrations of Governor Seymour and President Pierce. Their\r\nsecession was certainly not prompted by fear of bullies. Neither\r\nfaction was a stranger to blows. If fear possessed the Hunkers, it\r\ngrew out of distrust of their supporters and of their numerical\r\nstrength; and, rather than be beaten, they preferred to follow the\r\nexample of the Barnburners in 1847, and of the Silver-Grays in 1850,\r\ntwo precedents that destroyed party loyalty to gratify the spirit of\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the Hunkers were first called Hardshells or\r\n\"Hards,\" and the Barnburners Softshells or \"Softs.\" These designations\r\nmeant that Dickinson and his followers never changed their principles,\r\nand that the Marcy-Seymour coalition trimmed its sails to catch the\r\nfavouring breeze.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Hards in September, 1853, left the prestige of\r\nregularity with the Softs. The latter also had the patronage of the\r\nstate and national administrations, the possession of Tammany, and the\r\nsupport of a large majority of the newspapers. But the Hards still\r\ntreated the Softs as the real secessionists. \"We have gotten rid of\r\nthe mischievous traitors,\" said Daniel S. Dickinson, in his Buffalo\r\nspeech of September 23, \"and let us keep clear of them. It is true\r\nthey say we are all on one platform, but when did we get there? No\r\nlonger ago than last winter, when such resolutions as the platform now\r\nembodies were introduced into the Assembly, a cholera patient could\r\nnot have scattered these very men more effectually.\"[428] Dickinson\r\nwas not blessed with John Van Buren's humour. A flash of wit rarely\r\nenlivened his speeches, yet he delighted in attacking an adversary\r\neven if compelled to do it with gloomy, dogged rhetoric. Of all the\r\nSofts, however, Horatio Seymour was the one whom Dickinson hated. \"It\r\nwas the first time a governor was ever found in their convention,\"\r\ncontinued the Binghamton statesman, \"and I know it will be the last\r\ntime _that_ Governor will be guilty of such an impropriety. He\r\ntempted them on with spoils in front, while the short boys of New York\r\npricked them up with bowie knives in the rear.\"[429]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 428: New York _Tribune_, September 27, 1853.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 429: New York _Tribune_, September 27, 1853.]\r\n\r\nSeymour appears to have taken Dickinson's animosity, as he took most\r\nthings, with composure. Nevertheless, if he looked for harmony on\r\nelection day, the letters of Charles O'Conor and Greene C. Bronson,\r\ndeclining an invitation to ratify the Softs' ticket at a meeting in\r\nTammany Hall, must have extinguished the hope. O'Conor was United\r\nStates attorney and Bronson collector of the port of New York; but\r\nthese two office-holders under Pierce used no varnish in their\r\ncorrespondence with the Pierce-Seymour faction. \"As a lover of honesty\r\nin politics and of good order in society,\" wrote Bronson, \"I cannot\r\napprove of nominations brought about by fraud and violence. Those who\r\nintroduce convicts and bullies into our conventions for the purpose of\r\ncontrolling events must not expect their proceedings will be\r\nsanctioned by me.\" Then he betrayed the old conservative's deep\r\ndislike of the Radicals' canal policy, the memory of which still\r\nrankled. \"If all the nominees were otherwise unexceptionable,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"they come before the public under the leadership of men\r\nwho have been striving to defeat the early completion of the public\r\nworks, and after the shameless breach of past pledges in relation to\r\nthe canals, there can be no reasonable ground for hope that new\r\npromises will be performed.\"[430]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 430: _Ibid._, September 26, 1853.]\r\n\r\nCharles O'Conor, with the envenomed skill of a practised prosecutor\r\ncoupled with a champion's coolness, aimed a heavier blow at the\r\noffending Softs. \"Judging the tickets by the names of the leading\r\nmembers of the two conventions no reasonable doubt can be entertained\r\nwhich of them is most devoted to preserving union and harmony between\r\nthe States of this confederacy. One of the conventions was\r\nuncontaminated by the presence of a single member ever known as an\r\nagitator of principles or practices tending in any degree to disturb\r\nthat union and harmony; the leaders of the other were but recently\r\nengaged in a course of political action directly tending to discord\r\nbetween the States. It has, indeed, presented a platform of principles\r\nunqualifiedly denouncing that political organisation as dangerous to\r\nthe permanency of the Union and inadmissible among Democrats; but when\r\nit is considered that the leaders, with one unimpressive exception,\r\nformerly withheld assent to that platform, or repudiated it, the\r\nresolution adopting it is not, in my opinion, entitled to any\r\nconfidence whatever. I adopt that ticket which was made by a\r\nconvention whose platform was adopted with sincerity and corresponds\r\nwith the political life and actions of its framers.\"[431]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 431: New York _Tribune_, September 26, 1853.]\r\n\r\nBronson's letter was dated September 22, 1853; and in less than a\r\nmonth he was removed from his post as collector. In resentment,\r\nseveral county conventions immediately announced him as their\r\ncandidate for governor in 1854. O'Conor continued in office a little\r\nlonger, but eventually he resigned. \"This proscriptive policy for\r\nopinion's sake will greatly accelerate and aggravate the decomposition\r\nof the Democratic party in this State,\" said the _Tribune_. \"That\r\nprocess was begun long since, but certain soft-headed quacks had\r\nthought it possible, by some hocus pocus, to restore the old unity and\r\nhealth.\"[432]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 432: _Ibid._, October 24, 1853.]\r\n\r\nThe Whigs delayed their state convention until the 5th of October.\r\nWashington Hunt, its chairman, made a strong plea for harmony, and in\r\nthe presence of almost certain victory, occasioned by a divided\r\nDemocracy, the delegates turned their attention to the work of making\r\nnominations. It took three ballots to select a candidate for\r\nattorney-general. Among the aspirants were Ogden Hoffman of New York\r\nand Roscoe Conkling of Utica, then a young man of twenty-five, who\r\nbore a name that was already familiar from an honourable parentage.\r\nThe people of Oneida had elected him district attorney as soon as he\r\ngained his majority, and, in the intervening years, the successful\r\nlawyer had rapidly proved himself a successful orator and politician\r\nwho would have to be reckoned with.[433]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 433: \"With advancing years Mr. Conkling's temperament\r\nchanged slightly. The exactions of legal life, and, to some extent,\r\nthe needs of his political experience, apparently estranged him from\r\nthe masses, although he was naturally one of the most approachable of\r\nmen.\"--Alfred R. Conkling, _The Life and Letters of Roscoe Conkling_,\r\npp. 203, 204.]\r\n\r\nBut Conkling did not get the coveted attorney-generalship. The great\r\nreputation of Ogden Hoffman, who has been styled \"the Erskine of the\r\nAmerican bar,\" and who then stood in isolated splendour among the\r\norators of his party, gave him the right of way. Hoffman had served in\r\nCongress during Van Buren's administration and as United States\r\nattorney under Harrison and Tyler. He was now sixty years of age, a\r\nfit opponent to the brilliant Brady, twenty-two years his junior. \"But\r\nfor indolence,\" said Horace Greeley, \"Hoffman might have been governor\r\nor cabinet minister ere this. Everybody likes him and he always runs\r\nahead of his ticket.\"[434] There was also an earnest effort to secure\r\na place upon the ticket for Elbridge G. Spaulding of Buffalo. He had\r\nbeen district attorney, city clerk, alderman, and mayor of his city.\r\nIn 1848 he went to the Assembly and in 1849 to Congress. He had\r\nalready disclosed the marked ability for finance that subsequently\r\ncharacterised his public and business career, giving him the\r\ndistinguishing title of \"father of the greenback.\" His friends now\r\nwanted to make him comptroller, but when this place went to James M.\r\nCook of Saratoga, a thrifty banker and manufacturer, who had been\r\nstate treasurer, Spaulding accepted the latter office. In its\r\nplatform, the convention hailed with satisfaction the prospect of a\r\nspeedy completion of the canals under Whig management, and boasted\r\nthat the Democrats had at last been forced to accept the Whig policy,\r\n\"so necessary to the greatness and prosperity of the State.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 434: New York _Tribune_, October 6, 1853.]\r\n\r\nThe success of the Whigs was inevitable. The secession of the Hards\r\ncould not operate otherwise than in a division of the Democratic vote;\r\nbut no one dreamed it would split the party in the middle. The Hards\r\nhad fought against the prestige of party regularity, the power of\r\npatronage, the influence of Tammany, and the majority of the press,\r\nwhile the removal of Bronson served notice upon office-holders that\r\nthose who favoured the Hards voluntarily mounted a guillotine. \"Heads\r\nof this class,\" said Greeley, \"rolled as recklessly as pumpkins from a\r\nharvest wagon.\"[435] Yet the Softs led the Hards by an average\r\nmajority of only 312. It was a tremendous surprise at Washington. A\r\ncartoon represented Pierce and Marcy as Louis XVI and his minister, on\r\nthe memorable 10th of August. \"Why, this is revolt!\" said the amazed\r\nKing. \"No, sire,\" responded the minister, \"it is Revolution.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: New York _Tribune_, October 8, 1853.]\r\n\r\nThe Whigs polled 162,000 votes, electing their state officers by an\r\naverage plurality of 66,000 and carrying the Legislature by a majority\r\nof forty-eight on joint ballot. Yet Ruggles and Denio, whose names\r\nappeared upon the ticket of each Democratic faction, were elected to\r\nthe Court of Appeals by 13,000 majority, showing that a united\r\nDemocratic party would have swept the State as it did in 1852.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs accepted their success as Sheridan said the English received\r\nthe peace of Amiens--as \"one of which everybody was glad and nobody\r\nwas proud.\" Of the 240,000 Whigs who voted in 1852, less than 170,000\r\nsupported the ticket in 1853. Some of this shrinkage was doubtless due\r\nto the natural falling off in an \"off year\" and to an unusually stormy\r\nelection day; but there were evidences of open revolt and studied\r\napathy which emphasised the want of harmony and the necessity for\r\nfixed principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nA BREAKING-UP OF PARTY TIES\r\n\r\n1854\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Hards and Softs quarrelled, and the Whigs showed weakness\r\nbecause of a want of harmony and the lack of principles, a great\r\ncontest was being waged at Washington. In December, 1853, Stephen A.\r\nDouglas, from his place in the United States Senate, introduced the\r\nfamous Nebraska bill affirming that the Clay compromise of 1850 had\r\nrepealed the Missouri compromise of 1820. This sounded the trumpet of\r\nbattle. The struggle of slavery and freedom was now to be fought to a\r\nfinish. The discussion in Congress began in January, 1854, and ended\r\non May 30. When it commenced the slavery question seemed settled; when\r\nit closed the country was in a ferment. Anti-slavery Whigs found\r\ncompanionship with Free-soil Democrats; the titles of \"Nebraska\" and\r\n\"Anti-Nebraska\" distinguished men's politics; conventions of\r\nDemocrats, Whigs, and Free-soilers met to resist \"the iniquity;\" and\r\non July 6 the Republican party, under whose banner the great fight was\r\nto be finished, found a birthplace at Jackson, Michigan.\r\n\r\nRufus King's part in the historic struggle of the Missouri Compromise\r\nwas played by William H. Seward in the great contest over its repeal.\r\nHe was the leader of the anti-slavery Whigs of the country, just as\r\nhis distinguished predecessor had been the leader of the anti-slavery\r\nforces in 1820. He marshalled the opposition, and, when he finally\r\ntook the floor on the 17th of February, he made a legal argument as\r\nclose, logical, and carefully considered as if addressed to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States. He developed the history of\r\nslavery and its successive compromises; he answered every argument in\r\nfavour of the bill; he appealed to its supporters to admit that they\r\nnever dreamed of its abrogating the compromise of 1820; he ridiculed\r\nthe idea that it was in the interest of peace; and he again referred\r\nto the \"higher law\" that had characterised his speech in 1850. \"The\r\nslavery agitation you deprecate so much,\" he said in concluding, \"is\r\nan eternal struggle between conservatism and progress; between truth\r\nand error; between right and wrong. You may sooner, by act of\r\nCongress, compel the sea to suppress its upheavings, and the round\r\nearth to extinguish its internal fires. You may legislate, and\r\nabrogate, and abnegate, as you will, but there is a Superior Power\r\nthat overrules all; that overrules not only all your actions and all\r\nyour refusals to act, but all human events, to the distant but\r\ninevitable result of the equal and universal liberty of all men.\"[436]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 221.]\r\n\r\nSeward was not an orator. He could hardly be called an effective\r\nspeaker. He was neither impassioned nor always impressive; but when he\r\nspoke he seemed to strike a blow that had in it the whole vigour and\r\nstrength of the public sentiment which he represented. So far as one\r\ncan judge from contemporary accounts he never spoke better than on\r\nthis occasion; or when it was more evident that he spoke with all the\r\nsincere emotion of one whose mind and heart alike were filled with the\r\ncause for which he pleaded. \"Some happy spell,\" he wrote his wife,\r\n\"seemed to have come over me and to have enabled me to speak with more\r\nfreedom and ease than on any former occasion here.\"[437] Rhodes\r\nsuggests that Seward \"could not conceal his exultation that the\r\nDemocrats had forsaken their high vantage ground and played into the\r\nhands of their opponents.\"[438] He became almost dramatic when he\r\nthrew down his gauntlet at the feet of every member of the Senate in\r\n1850 and challenged him to say that he knew, or thought, or dreamed,\r\nthat by enacting the compromise of 1850 he was directly or indirectly\r\nabrogating, or in any degree impairing the Missouri Compromise. \"If\r\nit were not irreverent,\" he continued, \"I would dare call up the\r\nauthor of both the compromises in question, from his honoured, though\r\nyet scarcely grass-covered grave, and challenge any advocate of this\r\nmeasure to confront that imperious shade, and say that, in making the\r\ncompromise of 1850, Henry Clay intended or dreamed that he was\r\nsubverting or preparing the way for a subversion of his greater work\r\nof 1820. Sir, if that spirit is yet lingering here over the scene of\r\nits mortal labours, it is now moved with more than human indignation\r\nagainst those who are perverting its last great public act.\"[439]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: _Ibid._, p. 222.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 438: James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n1, p. 453.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 439: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 220.]\r\n\r\nSeward's speech created a profound impression throughout New York and\r\nthe North. \"It probably affected the minds of more men,\" says Rhodes,\r\n\"than any speech delivered on that side of this question in\r\nCongress.\"[440] Senator Houston had it translated into German and\r\nextensively circulated among the Germans of western Texas. Even Edwin\r\nCroswell congratulated him upon its excellence. It again directed the\r\nattention of the country to his becoming a presidential candidate,\r\nabout which newspapers and politicians had already spoken. Montgomery\r\nBlair's letter of May 17, 1873, to Gideon Welles, charges Seward with\r\nboasting that he had \"put Senator Dixon up to moving the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise as an amendment to Douglas' first Kansas bill, and\r\nhad himself forced the repeal by that movement, and had thus brought\r\nlife to the Republican party.\"[441] Undoubtedly Seward read the signs\r\nof the times, and saw clearly and quickly that repeal would probably\r\nresult in a political revolution, bringing into life an anti-slavery\r\nparty that would sweep the country. But the charge that he claimed to\r\nhave suggested the repeal, smells too strongly of Welles' dislike of\r\nSeward, and needs other evidence than Blair's telltale letter to\r\nsupport it. It is on a par with Senator Atchinson's assertion, made\r\nunder the influence of wine, that he forced Douglas to bring in the\r\nNebraska bill--a statement that the Illinois Senator promptly stamped\r\nas false.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 440: James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n1, p. 453.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 441: Gideon Welles, _Lincoln and Seward_, p. 68.]\r\n\r\nThe temper of the people of the State began to change very soon after\r\nthe introduction of Douglas' proposal. Remonstrances, letters, and\r\nresolutions poured in from Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, and\r\nother cities. Senator Fish presented a petition headed by the Bishop\r\nof the Episcopal Church and signed by a majority of the clergymen of\r\nNew York City. Merchants, lawyers, and business men generally, who had\r\nactively favoured the compromise of 1850, now spoke in earnest protest\r\nagainst the repeal of the compromise of 1820. From the first, the\r\nGermans opposed it. Of their newspapers only eight out of eighty-eight\r\nwere favourable. Public meetings, full of enthusiasm and noble\r\nsentiment, resembled religious gatherings enlisted in a holy war\r\nagainst a great social evil. The first assembled in New York City as\r\nearly as January 30, six days after the repeal was agreed upon.\r\nAnother larger meeting occurred on the 18th of February. It was here\r\nthat Henry Ward Beecher's great genius asserted the fulness of its\r\nintellectual power. He had been in Brooklyn five years. The series of\r\nforensic achievements which began at the Kossuth banquet in 1851 had\r\nalready made him the favourite speaker of the city, but, on the 18th\r\nof February, he became the idol of the anti-slavery host. Wit, wisdom,\r\npatriotism, and pathos, mingled with the loftiest strains of\r\neloquence, compelled the attention and the admiration of every\r\nlistener. When he concluded the whole assembly rose to do him honour;\r\ntears rolled down the cheeks of men and women. Everything was\r\nforgotten, save the great preacher and the cause for which he stood.\r\n\"The storm that is rising,\" wrote Seward, \"is such an one as this\r\ncountry has never yet seen. The struggle will go on, but it will be a\r\nstruggle for the whole American people.\"[442] In the _Tribune_ of May\r\n17, Greeley said that Pierce and Douglas had made more Abolitionists\r\nin three months than Garrison and Phillips could have made in half a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 442: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 222.]\r\n\r\nThe agitation resulted in an anti-Nebraska state convention, held at\r\nSaratoga on the 16th of August. It was important in the men who\r\ncomposed it. John A. King called it to order; Horace Greeley reported\r\nthe resolutions; Henry J. Raymond represented the district that had\r\ntwice sent him to the Assembly; and Moses H. Grinnell became chairman\r\nof its executive committee. In the political struggles of two decades\r\nmost of its delegates had filled prominent and influential positions.\r\nThese men were now brought together by an absorbing sense of duty and\r\na common impulse of resistance to the encroachments of slavery. People\r\nsupposed a new party would be formed and a ticket nominated as in\r\nMichigan; but after an animated and at times stormy discussion, the\r\ndelegates concluded that in principle too little difference existed to\r\nwarrant the present disturbance of existing organisations. So, after\r\ndeclaring sentiments which were to become stronger than party ties or\r\nparty discipline, it agreed to reassemble at Auburn on September\r\n26.[443]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: \"After the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska act, it would\r\nseem as if the course of the opposition were plain. That the different\r\nelements of opposition should be fused into one complete whole seemed\r\npolitical wisdom. That course involved the formation of a new party\r\nand was urged warmly and persistently by many newspapers, but by none\r\nwith such telling influence as by the New York _Tribune_. It had\r\nlikewise the countenance of Chase, Sumner, and Wade. There were three\r\nelements that must be united--the Whigs, the Free-soilers, and the\r\nAnti-Nebraska Democrats. The Whigs were the most numerous body and as\r\nthose at the North, to a man, had opposed the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise they thought, with some quality of reason, that the fight\r\nmight well be made under their banner and with their name. For the\r\norganisation of a party was not the work of a day. Why, then, go to\r\nall this trouble, when a complete organisation is at hand ready for\r\nuse? This view of the situation was ably argued by the New York\r\n_Times_, and was supported by Senator Seward. As the New York Senator\r\nhad a position of influence superior to any one who had opposed the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill, strenuous efforts were made to get his adhesion\r\nto a new party movement, but they were without avail. 'Seward hangs\r\nfire,' wrote Dr. Bailey. 'He agrees with Thurlow Weed.'--(Bailey to\r\nJ.S. Pike, May 30, 1854, _First Blows of the Civil War_, p. 237.) 'We\r\nare not yet ready for a great national convention at Buffalo or\r\nelsewhere,' wrote Seward to Theodore Parker; 'it would bring together\r\nonly the old veterans. The States are the places for activity just\r\nnow.'--(_Life of Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 232.) Yet many Whigs who were not\r\ndevoted to machine politics saw clearly that a new party must be\r\nformed under a new name. They differed, however, in regard to their\r\nbond of union. Some wished to go to the country with simply _Repeal of\r\nthe Kansas-Nebraska act_ inscribed on their banner. Others wished to\r\nplant themselves squarely on prohibition of slavery in all the\r\nterritories. Still others preferred the resolve that not another slave\r\nState should be admitted into the Union. Yet after all, the time\r\nseemed ripe for the formation of a party whose cardinal principle\r\nmight be summed up as opposition to the extension of slavery.\"--James\r\nF. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. 2, p. 45-7.]\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska Act also became a new source of division to Democrats.\r\nMarcy's opposition, based upon apprehensions of its disastrous effect\r\nin New York, was so pronounced that he contemplated resigning as\r\nsecretary of state--a step that his friends persuaded him to abandon.\r\nJohn Van Buren was equally agitated. \"Could anything but a desire to\r\nbuy the South at the presidential shambles dictate such an\r\noutrage?\"[444] he asked Senator Clemens of Alabama. But nothing could\r\nstop the progress of the Illinois statesman; and, while the Whigs of\r\nNew York ably and uniformly opposed repeal, Democrats broke along the\r\nlines dividing the Hards and the Softs. Of twenty-one Democratic\r\ncongressmen, nine favoured and twelve opposed it. Among the former was\r\nWilliam M. Tweed, the unsavoury boss of later years; among the latter,\r\nReuben E. Fenton, Rufus W. Peckham, and Russell Sage. The Democratic\r\npress separated along similar lines. Thirty-seven Hards supported the\r\nmeasure; thirty-eight Softs opposed it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: New York _Evening Post_, February 11, 1854.]\r\n\r\nThe Hards held their state convention on the 12th of July. Their late\r\ntrial of strength with the Softs had resulted in a drawn battle, and\r\nit was now their purpose to force the Pierce-Seymour Softs out of the\r\nparty. The proceedings began with a challenge. Lyman Tremaine spoke\r\nof the convention as one in which the President had no minions; Samuel\r\nBeardsley, the chairman, after charging Pierce with talking one way\r\nand acting another, declared that the next Chief Executive would both\r\ntalk and act like a national Democrat. Further, to emphasise its\r\nindependence and dislike of the President, the convention nominated\r\nGreene C. Bronson for governor as the representative of Pierce's\r\nproscriptive policy for opinion's sake. But there was no disposition\r\nto criticise Pierce's pro-slavery policy. It favoured the repeal of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise, proclaiming the doctrine of non-intervention\r\nby Congress and the right of the territories to make their own local\r\nlaws, including regulations relating to domestic servitude. It also\r\napproved the recently ratified canal amendment and strongly favoured\r\nthe prohibitive liquor law vetoed by Governor Seymour.\r\n\r\nGreene C. Bronson's career had been distinguished. He had served as\r\nassemblyman, as attorney-general for seven years, as chief justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court, and as an original member of the Court of Appeals.\r\nAlthough now well advanced in years, age had not cowed his spirit or\r\nlessened the purity of a character which shone in the gentleness of\r\namiable manners; but his pro-slavery platform hit his consistency a\r\nhard blow. In 1819, as secretary of a mass-meeting called to oppose\r\nthe Missouri Compromise, he had declared that Congress possessed the\r\nclear and indisputable power to prohibit the admission of slavery in\r\nany State or territory thereafter to be formed. If this was good law\r\nin 1819 it was good law in 1854, and the acceptance of a contrary\r\ntheory put him at a serious disadvantage. His attitude on the liquor\r\nquestion also proved a handicap. He showed that the position of judge\r\nin interpreting the law was a very different thing from that of making\r\nthe law by steering a party into power in a crucial campaign.\r\n\r\nThe convention of the Softs followed on September 6. Two preliminary\r\ncaucuses indicated a strong anti-Nebraska sentiment. But a bold and\r\nresolute opposition, led by federal officials and John Cochrane, the\r\nBarnburners' platform-maker, portended trouble. There was no\r\ndisagreement on state issues. The approval of Seymour's administration\r\nsettled the policy of canal improvement and anti-prohibition, but the\r\ndelegates balked on the cunningly worded resolution declaring the\r\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise inexpedient and unnecessary, yet\r\nrejoicing that it would benefit the territories and forbidding any\r\nattempt to undo it. It put the stamp of Nebraska upon the proceedings,\r\nand the deathlike stillness which greeted its reading shook the nerves\r\nof the superstitious as an unfavourable omen. Immediately, a short\r\nsubstitute was offered, unqualifiedly disapproving the repeal as a\r\nviolation of legislative good faith and of the spirit of Christian\r\ncivilisation; and when Preston King took the floor in its favour the\r\ndeafening applause disclosed the fact that the anti-Nebraskans had the\r\nenthusiasm if not the numbers. As the champion of the Wilmot Proviso\r\nconcluded, the assembly resembled the Buffalo convention of 1848 at\r\nthe moment of its declaration for free soil, free speech, free labour,\r\nand free men. But the roll call changed the scene. Of the 394\r\ndelegates, 245 voted to lay the substitute on the table.\r\n\r\nThis result was a profound surprise. The public expected different\r\naction and the preliminary caucuses showed an anti-Nebraska majority;\r\nbut the Custom-House had done its work well. The promise of a\r\nnomination for lieutenant-governor had changed the mind of William H.\r\nLudlow, chairman of the convention, who packed the committee on\r\nresolutions. Similar methods won fifty other delegates. But despite\r\nthe shock, Preston King did not hesitate. He might be broken, but he\r\ncould not be bent. Rising with dignity he withdrew from the\r\nconvention, followed by a hundred others who ceased to act further\r\nwith it. Subsequent proceedings reflected the gloom of a body out of\r\nwhich the spirit had departed. Delegates kept dropping out until only\r\none hundred and ninety-nine remained to cheer the nomination of\r\nHoratio Seymour. On a roll call for lieutenant-governor, Philip\r\nDorsheimer declared it a disgrace to have his name called in a\r\nconvention that had adopted such a platform.\r\n\r\nThe Whig convention followed on September 20. A divided Democracy\r\nagain made candidates confident, and eight or ten names were presented\r\nfor governor. Horace Greeley thought it time his turn should come. He\r\nhad been pronounced in his advocacy of the Maine liquor law and active\r\nin his hostility to the Nebraska Act. As these were to be the issues\r\nof the campaign, he applied with confidence to Weed for help. The\r\nAlbany editor frankly admitted that his friends had lost control of\r\nthe convention, and that Myron H. Clark would probably get the\r\nnomination. Then Greeley asked to be made lieutenant-governor. Weed\r\nreminded him of the outcry in the Whig national convention of 1848\r\nagainst having \"cotton at both ends of the ticket.\" \"I suppose you\r\nmean,\" replied Greeley, laughing, \"that it won't do to have\r\nprohibition at both ends of our state ticket.\"[445] But, though he\r\nlaughed, the editor of the _Tribune_ went away nettled and humiliated.\r\nIn the contest, which became exciting, Greeley's friends urged his\r\nselection for governor without formally presenting his name to the\r\nconvention; but on the third ballot Clark received the nomination,\r\nobtaining 82 out of the 132 votes cast.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 445: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n226.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Greeley called upon me at the Astor House and asked if I did not\r\nthink that the time and circumstances were favourable to his\r\nnomination. I replied that I did not think the time and circumstances\r\nfavourable to his election, if nominated, but that my friends had lost\r\ncontrol of the state convention. This answer perplexed him, but a few\r\nwords of explanation made it quite clear. Admitting that he had\r\nbrought the people up to the point of accepting a temperance candidate\r\nfor governor, I remarked that another aspirant had 'stolen his\r\nthunder.' In other words, while he had shaken the temperance bush,\r\nMyron H. Clark would catch the bird. I informed Mr. Greeley that\r\nKnow-Nothing or 'Choctaw' lodges had been secretly organised\r\nthroughout the State, by means of which many delegates for Mr. Clark\r\nhad been secured. Mr. Greeley saw that the 'slate' had been broken,\r\nand cheerfully relinquished the idea of being nominated. But a few\r\ndays afterwards Mr. Greeley came to Albany, and said in an abrupt but\r\nnot unfriendly way, 'Is there any objection to my running for\r\nlieutenant-governor?'... After a little more conversation, Mr. Greeley\r\nbecame entirely satisfied that a nomination for lieutenant-governor\r\nwas not desirable, and left me in good spirits.\"--_Ibid._, Vol. 2, p.\r\n226.]\r\n\r\nMyron H. Clark, now in his forty-ninth year, belonged to the class of\r\nmen generally known as fanatics. He was a plain man of humble\r\npretensions and slender attainments. He was originally a cabinet-maker\r\nand afterward a merchant. Then he became a reformer. He sympathised\r\nwith the Native Americans; he approved Seward's views upon slavery;\r\nand he interested himself in the workingmen. But his hobby was\r\ntemperance. Its advocates made his home in Canandaigua their\r\nheadquarters, and during the temperance revival which swept over the\r\nState in the early fifties, he aided in directing the movement. This\r\nexperience opened his way, in 1851, to the State Senate. Here he\r\ndisplayed some of the legislative gifts that distinguished John Young.\r\nHe had patience and persistence; he could talk easily and well; and,\r\nunderneath his enthusiasm, lingered the shrewdness of a skilled\r\ndiplomat. When, at last, the Maine liquor bill, which he had\r\nintroduced and engineered, passed the Legislature, his name was a\r\nhousehold word throughout the State. Seymour's veto of the measure\r\nstrengthened Clark. People realised that a governor no less than a\r\nlegislature was needed to make laws, and, with the spirit of\r\nreformers, the delegates demanded his nomination. To Weed it seemed\r\nhazardous; but a majority of the convention, believing that Clark's\r\npublic career had been sagacious and upright, refused to take another.\r\n\r\nClark's nomination made the selection of a candidate for\r\nlieutenant-governor more difficult. The prohibitionists were\r\nsatisfied; Greeley was not. In their anxiety, the delegates canvassed\r\nseveral names without result. Finally, with great suddenness and\r\namidst much enthusiasm, Henry J. Raymond was nominated. This deeply\r\nwounded Greeley. \"He had cheerfully withdrawn his own name,\" wrote\r\nWeed, \"but he could not submit patiently to the nomination of his\r\npersonal, professional, and political rival.\"[446] Greeley believed\r\nit was not the convention, but Weed himself, who brought it about. On\r\nthe contrary, Weed declared that he had no thought of Raymond in that\r\nconnection until his name was suggested by others. Nevertheless, the\r\n_Tribune's_ editor held to his own opinion. \"No other name could have\r\nbeen put upon the ticket so bitterly humbling to me,\"[447] he\r\nafterward wrote Seward. To Greeley, Raymond was \"The little Villain of\r\nthe _Times_;\" to Raymond, Greeley was \"The big Villain of the\r\n_Tribune_.\"[448] In any aspect, Raymond was an unfortunate nomination\r\nfor Weed, since it began the quarrel that culminated in the defeat of\r\nSeward at Chicago in 1860.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 446: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n227.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 447: _Ibid._, p. 280.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 448: In a letter to Charles A. Dana, dated March 2, 1856,\r\nGreeley indicates his feeling toward Raymond. \"Have we got to\r\nsurrender a page of the next _Weekly_ to Raymond's bore of an\r\naddress?\" he says, referring to the Pittsburgh convention's appeal.\r\n\"The man who could inflict six columns on a long-suffering public, on\r\nsuch an occasion, cannot possibly know enough to write an address.\"]\r\n\r\nEarly in the campaign, Greeley favoured dropping the name of Whig and\r\norganising an anti-Nebraska or Republican party, with a ticket of\r\nWhigs and Democrats, as had been done in some of the Western States.\r\nBut Seward and Weed, with a majority of the Whig leaders, thought that\r\nwhile fusion might be advisable wherever the party was essentially\r\nweak, as in Ohio and Indiana, it was wiser, in States like New York\r\nand Massachusetts where Whigs were in power, to retain the party name\r\nand organisation.[449] In so deciding, however, they agreed with\r\nGreeley that the platform should be thoroughly anti-Nebraska, and they\r\ngave it a touch that kindled the old fire in the hearts of the\r\nanti-slavery veterans. It condemned the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise, approved the course of the New York senators and\r\nrepresentatives who resisted it, declared that it discharged the party\r\nfrom further obligation to support any compromise with slavery, and\r\ndenounced \"popular sovereignty\" as a false and deceptive cry, \"too\r\nflimsy to mislead any but those anxious to be deluded and eager to be\r\nled astray.\" This declaration of principles was summarised as\r\n\"Justice, Temperance, and Freedom.\" One delegate, amidst great\r\napplause, said he felt glorified that the party was disenthralled and\r\nredeemed. Roscoe Conkling, a vice president, spoke of the convention\r\nas belonging to \"the Republican party.\" Greeley declared the platform\r\n\"as noble as any friend of freedom could have expected.\" Other state\r\norganisations also approved it. The anti-Nebraska convention, upon\r\nreassembling in Auburn on September 26, adopted the Whig ticket. The\r\nstate temperance convention indorsed the nomination of Clark and\r\nRaymond, and the Free Democrats accepted Clark. This practically made\r\na fusion ticket.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: \"I was a member of the first anti-Nebraska or\r\nRepublican State Convention, which met at Saratoga Springs in\r\nSeptember; but Messrs. Weed and Seward for a while stood aloof from\r\nthe movement, preferring to be still regarded as Whigs.\"--Horace\r\nGreeley, _Recollections of a Busy Life_, p. 314.]\r\n\r\nEarly in October the Native Americans went into council. This\r\norganisation, which had elected a mayor of New York in 1844, suddenly\r\nrevived in 1854; and, in spite of its intolerant and prescriptive\r\nspirit, the movement spread rapidly. Mystery surrounded its methods.\r\nIt held meetings in unknown places; its influence could not be\r\nmeasured; and its members professed to know nothing. Thus it became\r\nknown as the \"Know-Nothing\" party. Members recognised each other by\r\nthe casual inquiry, \"Have you seen Sam?\" and when one of the old\r\nparties collapsed at a local election the reply came, \"We have seen\r\nSam.\" Its secrecy fascinated young men, and its dominant principle,\r\n\"America for Americans,\" stirred them into unusual activity. The\r\nskilful use of patriotic phrases also had its influence. The \"Star\r\nSpangled Banner\" was its emblem, Washington its patron saint, and his\r\nthrilling command, \"Put none but Americans on guard to-night,\" its\r\nfavourite password. Henry Wilson of Massachusetts joined it as an\r\ninstrument for destroying the old parties, which he regarded an\r\nobstacle to freedom; but Seward thought this was doing evil that good\r\nmight come. Everything is un-American, he argued, which makes a\r\ndistinction between the native-born American and the one who renounces\r\nhis allegiance to a foreign land and swears fealty to the country that\r\nadopts him. \"Why,\" he asked, \"should I exclude the foreigner to-day?\r\nHe is only what every American citizen or his ancestor was at some\r\ntime or other.\"[450]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 450: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 234.]\r\n\r\nThe voting strength of this party in New York was estimated at 65,000,\r\ndivided between Hards, Softs, and Whigs, with one-fifth each, and the\r\nSilver-Grays with two-fifths. On the question of putting up a state\r\nticket, its council divided. The Silver-Grays, it was said, favoured\r\ncandidates in order to defeat Clark; while the Whigs and Softs\r\npreferred making no nominations. In the end, Daniel Ullman, a\r\nreputable New York lawyer of mediocre ability, received the nomination\r\nfor governor. The great overmastering passion of Ullman was a desire\r\nfor office. For many years he had been a persistent and unsuccessful\r\nknocker at the door of city, county and state Whig conventions, and\r\nwhen the Know-Nothings appeared he turned to them to back his\r\nambition. Possibly they knew that his parents were foreign-born, but\r\nthe mystery surrounding his own birthplace became a comical feature of\r\nthe canvass. It was claimed, upon what seemed proper evidence at the\r\ntime, that Ullman was born in India and had not become a naturalised\r\ncitizen of the United States. This made him ineligible as the\r\ncandidate of his party, and disqualified him from serving as governor\r\nif elected.\r\n\r\nThe campaign opened with two clearly defined issues--limitation of the\r\nliquor traffic and condemnation of the Nebraska Act. Clark stood for\r\nboth, Ullman stood for neither; Bronson and Seymour opposed\r\nprohibition and approved the Nebraska Act. Greeley declared that the\r\ntwo Democratic candidates differed only \"as to whether the contempt\r\nuniversally felt for President Pierce should be openly expressed, or\r\nmore decorously cherished in silence.\" As the canvass advanced, the\r\nreal contest became prohibition, with Bronson and Seymour apparently\r\nrunning a race for the liquor vote, while Ullman was silently securing\r\nthe votes of men who thought the proscription of foreign-born citizens\r\nmore important than either freedom or temperance. To the most adroit\r\npolitical prognosticators the situation was confused. Greeley\r\nestimated Clark's strength at 200,000, and that of the next highest,\r\neither Seymour or Bronson, at 150,000; but so little was known of the\r\nKnow-Nothings that he omitted Ullman from the calculation. Another\r\nprophet fixed Ullman's strength at 65,000. The surprise was great,\r\ntherefore, when the returns disclosed a Know-Nothing vote of 122,000,\r\nwith Clark and Seymour running close to 156,000 each, and Bronson with\r\nless than 35,000. The people did not seem to have been thinking about\r\nBronson at all. Seymour's veto commended the Governor to the larger\r\ncities, and it swept him on like a whirlwind. New York gave him\r\n26,000. His election was conceded by the Whigs and claimed by the\r\nDemocrats; but, after several weeks of anxious waiting, the official\r\ncount made Clark the governor by a plurality of 309.[451] Including\r\ndefective votes plainly intended for Seymour, Clark's plurality was\r\nonly 153. Raymond ran 600 ahead of Clark, but his plurality over\r\nLudlow was 20,000, since the latter's vote was 20,000 less than\r\nSeymour's. These twenty thousand preferred to vote for Elijah Ford of\r\nBuffalo, who ran for lieutenant-governor on the ticket with Bronson,\r\npossibly because of Ludlow's alleged perfidy at the Syracuse\r\nconvention. Of the congressmen elected, twenty-five were Whigs, three\r\nSofts, two Anti-Nebraskans, and three Know-Nothings; in the Assembly\r\nthere were eighty-one Whigs, twenty-six Softs, and seventeen Hards.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 451: Myron H. Clark, 156,804; Horatio Seymour, 156,495;\r\nDaniel Ullman, 122,282; Green C. Bronson, 33,850.--_Civil List, State\r\nof New York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the election could scarcely be called a Whig victory;\r\nbut it was a popular rebuke to the Nebraska bill. Clark's majority,\r\nslender as it finally appeared by the official count, was due to the\r\nWhigs occupying common ground with Free-soilers who discarded party\r\nattachments in behalf of their cherished convictions. The Silver-Grays\r\nfound a home with the Hards and the Know-Nothings, and many Democrats,\r\nunwilling to go to the Whigs, voted for Ullman.\r\n\r\nIt was the breaking-up of old parties. The great political crisis\r\nwhich had been threatening the country for many years was about to\r\nburst, and, like the first big raindrops that precede a downpour, the\r\nchanges in 1854 announced its presence. It had been so long in coming\r\nthat John W. Taylor of Saratoga, the champion opponent of the Missouri\r\nCompromise, was dying when Horace Greeley, at the anti-Nebraska\r\nconvention held in Taylor's home in August, 1854, was writing into the\r\nplatform of the new Republican party the principles that Taylor tried\r\nto write into the old Republican party in 1820. \"Whoever reads\r\nTaylor's speeches in that troubled period,\" says Stanton, \"will find\r\nthem as sound in doctrine, as strong in argument, as splendid in\r\ndiction, as any of the utterances of the following forty-five years,\r\nwhen the thirteenth amendment closed the controversy for all\r\ntime.\"[452]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 452: H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 164. John W.\r\nTaylor served twenty consecutive years in Congress--a longer\r\ncontinuous service than any New York successor. Taylor also bears the\r\nproud distinction of being the only speaker from New York. Twice he\r\nwas honoured as the successor of Henry Clay. He died at the home of\r\nhis daughter in Cleveland, Ohio, in September, 1854, at the age of\r\nseventy, leaving a place in history strongly marked.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\r\n\r\n1854-5\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1855 became a turning-point in the career of William H.\r\nSeward. The voice of the anti-slavery Whigs proclaimed him the only\r\nman fitted by position, ability, and character to succeed himself in\r\nthe United States Senate. To them he possessed all the necessary\r\nqualities for leadership. In his hands they believed the banner of\r\nopposition to the extension of slavery would be kept at the front and\r\nevery other cause subordinated to it. This feeling was generously\r\nshared by the press of New York. \"The repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise,\" said Henry J. Raymond in the _Times_, \"has developed a\r\npopular sentiment in the North which will probably elect Governor\r\nSeward to the Presidency in 1856 by the largest vote from the free\r\nStates ever cast for any candidate.\"[453] Even the Democratic _Evening\r\nPost_ admitted that \"Seward is in the ascendancy in this State.\"[454]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 453: New York _Times_, June 1, 1854.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 454: New York _Evening Post_, May 23, 1854.]\r\n\r\nThe Legislature was overwhelmingly Whig. Nearly three-fourths of the\r\nAssembly and two-thirds of the Senate had been elected as Whigs.\r\nAlthough Seward did not make a speech or appear publicly in the\r\ncampaign of 1854, he had been active in seeing that members were\r\nchosen who would vote for him. But, notwithstanding the Whigs\r\ncontrolled the Legislature, many of them belonged to the\r\nKnow-Nothings, whose noisy opposition soon filled the air with rumours\r\nof their intention to defeat Seward. The secrecy that veiled the\r\ndoings of the order now concealed the strength of their numbers; but,\r\nas Seward's course had been sufficient to array its entire membership\r\nagainst him, there was little doubt of the attitude of all its\r\nrepresentatives. Though he had not violently denounced them as Douglas\r\ndid at Philadelphia, men of otherwise liberal opinions were angry\r\nbecause he seemed deliberately to support views opposed to their most\r\ncherished principles. His recommendation, while governor, to divide\r\nthe public money with Catholic schools was recalled with bitter\r\ncomment. The more recent efforts of Bishop Hughes, an ardent friend of\r\nthe Senator, to exclude the Bible from the public schools, added to\r\nthe feeling; while the coming of a papal nuncio to adjust a\r\ncontroversy in regard to church property between a bishop and a\r\nCatholic congregation in Buffalo which had the law of the State on its\r\nside, greatly increased the bitterness. Thus the old controversy was\r\ntorn open, hostility increasing so rapidly that Thurlow Weed declared\r\n\"there is very much peril about the senator question.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Know-Nothings was to prevent an election in the Senate\r\nand then block a joint session of the two houses. This scheme had\r\nsucceeded in defeating Ambrose Spencer in 1825 and Nathaniel P.\r\nTallmadge in 1845, and there was no apparent reason why similar\r\nmethods might not be invoked in 1855, unless the manifest inability of\r\nSeward's adversaries to unite upon some one opponent gave his\r\nsupporters the upper hand. Millard Fillmore, Ira Harris, and\r\nWashington Hunt had their friends; but an anti-slavery Know-Nothing\r\ncould not support Fillmore or Hunt, and a Silver-Gray Whig did not\r\ntake kindly to Harris. This was the cornerstone of Greeley's\r\nconfidence. Besides, the more bitter the criticism of Seward's record,\r\nthe more inclined were certain senators of the Democratic party, who\r\ndid not sympathise with the Know-Nothing aversion to foreigners, to\r\nsupport the Auburn statesman.[455] There was no hope for Seymour, or\r\nDix, or Preston King, and some of their friends in the Senate who\r\nadmired the anti-slavery views of Seward could stop the play of the\r\nKnow-Nothings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 455: \"There is about as much infidelity among Whigs at\r\nAlbany as was expected; perhaps a little more. But there is also a\r\ncounteracting agency in the other party, it is said, which promises to\r\nbe an equilibrium.\"--F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n243.]\r\n\r\nThus the contest grew fiercer. It was the chief topic in Albany. All\r\ndebate ended in its discussion. When, at last, DeWitt C. Littlejohn,\r\nvacating the speaker's chair, took the floor for the distinguished New\r\nYorker, the excitement reached its climax. The speaker's bold and\r\nfearless defence met a storm of personal denunciation that broke from\r\nthe ranks of the Know-Nothings; but his speech minimised their\r\nopposition and inspired Seward's forces to work out a magnificent\r\nvictory. \"Our friends are in good spirits and reasonably confident,\"\r\nwrote Seward. \"Our adversaries are not confident, and are out of\r\ntemper.\"[456] Finally, on February 1, the caucus met. Five Whig\r\nsenators and twenty assemblymen, representing the bulk of the\r\nopposition, were absent; but of the eighty present, seventy-four voted\r\nfor Seward. This stifled the hope of the Silver-Gray Know-Nothings.\r\nIndeed, several of Seward's opponents now fell into line, giving him\r\neighteen out of thirty-one votes in the Senate and sixty-nine out of\r\none hundred and twenty-six in the Assembly. The five dissenting Whig\r\nsenators voted for Fillmore, Ullman, Ogden Hoffman, Preston King, and\r\nGeorge R. Babcock of Buffalo. Of the nineteen opposing Whig votes in\r\nthe Assembly, Washington Hunt received nine and Fillmore four. When\r\nthe two houses compared the vote in joint session, Henry J. Raymond,\r\nthe lieutenant-governor, announced with evident emotion to a\r\nsympathetic audience which densely packed the Assembly chamber, that\r\n\"William H. Seward was duly elected as a senator of the United States\r\nfor six years from the fourth of March, 1855.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 456: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 243.]\r\n\r\nSeward did not visit Albany or Auburn during the contest. A patent\r\nsuit kept him busy in New York City until the middle of January, after\r\nwhich he returned to his place in the Senate. He professed to \"have\r\nthe least possible anxiety about it,\" writing Weed early in December\r\nthat \"I would not have you suffer one moment's pain on the ground\r\nthat I am not likely to be content and satisfied with whatever may\r\nhappen;\"[457] yet a letter written five months afterward, on his\r\nfifty-fifth birthday, gives a glimpse of what defeat would have meant\r\nto him. \"How happy I am,\" he says, \"that age and competence bring no\r\nserious and permanent disappointment to sour and disgust me with\r\ncountry or mankind.\"[458] To Weed he shows a heart laden with\r\ngratitude. \"I snatch a minute,\" he writes, \"to express not so much my\r\ndeep and deepened gratitude to you, as my amazement at the magnitude\r\nand complexity of the dangers through which you have conducted our\r\nshattered bark, and the sagacity and skill with which you have saved\r\nus from so imminent a wreck.\"[459] But Seward was not more amazed at\r\nthe dangers he had escaped than at the great number of congratulations\r\nnow pouring in from opponents. \"Was ever anything more curious,\" he\r\nwrites his wife, \"than the fact that this result is scarcely more\r\nsatisfactory to my truest friends, than, as it seems, to so many\r\nlifelong opponents? We have nothing but salutations and\r\ncongratulations here. How strange the mutations of politics.\"[460]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 457: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 243.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 458: _Ibid._, p. 251.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 459: _Ibid._, p. 245.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 460: _Ibid._, p. 246.]\r\n\r\nAfter Seward's re-election the Kansas troubles began attracting\r\nattention. Governor Reeder fixed March 30, 1855, for the election of a\r\nterritorial legislature, and just before it occurred five thousand\r\nMissourians, \"with guns upon their shoulders, revolvers stuffing their\r\nbelts, bowie-knives protruding from their boot-tops, and generous\r\nrations of whiskey in their wagons,\"[461] marched into the territory\r\nto superintend the voting. This army intimidated such of the election\r\njudges as were not already pro-slavery men; and of six thousand votes,\r\nthree-fourths of them were cast by the Missourians in the interest of\r\nslavery. The Northern press recorded the fraud. If further evidence\r\nwere needed, Governor Reeder's speech, published in the New York\r\n_Times_ of May 1, in which he declared that the fierce violence and\r\nwild outrages reported by the newspapers were in no wise exaggerated,\r\nset all controversy at rest. Instantly the North was in a ferment. The\r\npredominant sentiment demanded that Kansas should be free, and the\r\nexcitement aroused by the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was\r\nquickly rekindled when the South approved the murderous methods\r\nintended to make it a slave State. A journal published in the\r\npro-slavery interest threatened \"to lynch and hang, tar and feather,\r\nand drown every white-livered Abolitionist who dares to pollute our\r\nsoil,\" and secret societies, organised for the purpose of keeping out\r\nNorthern immigrants, resolved \"that we recognise the institution of\r\nslavery as already existing in this territory, and advise\r\nslave-holders to introduce their property as early as possible.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 461: Spring's _Kansas_, p. 44; see also, Sara Robinson,\r\n_Kansas_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\nAs the year went on matters got worse. The territorial legislature,\r\nelected by admitted and wholesale fraud, unseated all free-state\r\nmembers whose election was contested, and proceeded to pass laws\r\nupholding and fortifying slavery. It declared it a felony, punishable\r\nby two years' imprisonment, to write or maintain that persons have not\r\nthe right to hold slaves in the territory; it disqualified all\r\nanti-slavery men from sitting as jurors; it made one's presence in the\r\nterritory sufficient qualification to vote; and it punished with death\r\nany one who assisted in the escape of fugitive slaves. When Reeder\r\nvetoed these acts the Legislature passed them over his head and\r\ndemanded the Governor's removal. To add to the popular feeling,\r\nalready deeply inflamed, President Pierce met this demand with\r\naffirmative action.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this political excitement, the Hards met in convention\r\nat Syracuse on August 23, 1855. That party had been sorely punished in\r\nthe preceding election; but it had in no way changed its attitude\r\ntoward opponents. It refused to invite the Softs to participate; it\r\ndenounced the national administration, and it condemned the\r\nKnow-Nothings. Daniel E. Sickles, then thirty-four years old, who was\r\ndestined to play a conspicuous part when the country was in\r\ndifficulty and the Government in danger, sought to broaden and\r\nliberalise its work; but the convention sullenly outvoted him. It\r\napproved the Nebraska Act, refused to listen to appeals in behalf of\r\nfreedom in Kansas, and rebuked all efforts to restore the Missouri\r\nCompromise. Only upon the liquor question did it modify its former\r\ndeclarations. The Hards had started off in 1854 in favour of\r\nprohibition. But during the campaign, Bronson changed his position,\r\nor, as Greeley put it, \"he first inclined to water, then to rum and\r\nwater, and finally he came out all rum.\" To keep in accord with their\r\nleader's latest change, the delegates now declared the prohibitory law\r\nunconstitutional and demanded its repeal. This law, passed on April 9,\r\n1855, and entitled \"An Act for the prevention of intemperance,\r\npauperism, and crime,\" permitted the sale of liquors for mechanical,\r\nchemical, and medicinal uses; but prohibited the traffic for other\r\npurposes. Its regulations, providing for search, prosecutions, and the\r\ndestruction of forfeited liquors, were the very strongest, and its\r\nenforcement gave rise to much litigation. Among other things it denied\r\ntrial by jury. In May, 1856, the Court of Appeals declared it\r\nunconstitutional. But while it lasted it gave the politicians much\r\nconcern. The Democrats disapproved and other parties avoided it.\r\n\r\nOn August 29, the Softs met in convention. The Barnburners, who had\r\nvainly extended the olive branch to the Hards, now faced an array of\r\nanti-slavery delegates that would not condone the Kansas outrages.\r\nThey would disapprove prohibition, commend Marcy's admirable foreign\r\npolicy, and praise the President's management of the exchequer; but\r\nthey would not countenance border ruffianism, encourage slavery\r\npropagandists in Kansas, or submit to the extension of slavery in the\r\nfree territories. It was a stormy convention. For three days the\r\ncontest raged; but when final action was taken, although the platform\r\ndid not in terms censure Pierce's administration, it condemned the\r\nKansas outrages which the President had approved by the removal of\r\nGovernor Reeder, and disapproved the extension of slavery into free\r\nterritories. Among the candidates nominated were Samuel J. Tilden for\r\nattorney-general, and Samuel L. Selden of Rochester for judge of the\r\nCourt of Appeals. Selden, who had been a district judge since 1847,\r\nwas also nominated by the Hards.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas disclosures had the effect of drawing into closer communion\r\nthe various shades of anti-slavery opinion in New York. Early in the\r\nsummer, the question was earnestly considered of enlisting all men\r\nopposed to the aggressions of slavery under the banner of the\r\nRepublican party, a political organisation formed, as has been stated,\r\nat Jackson, Michigan, on July 6, 1854. Horace Greeley had suggested\r\nthe name \"Republican\" as an unobjectionable one for the new party;\r\nand, within a week after its adoption at Jackson, it became the name\r\nof the Free-soilers who marshalled in Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois,\r\nVermont, and Massachusetts. The anti-Nebraska convention of New York,\r\nwhich reassembled in Auburn on the 27th of September, 1854, also\r\nadopted the name, calling its executive committee \"the Republican\r\nstate committee.\" It was not a new name in the Empire State. Voters in\r\nmiddle life had all been Republicans in their early years; and long\r\nafter the formation of the National Republicans in 1828, and of the\r\nWhig party in 1834, the designation had been used with approval by the\r\nRegency. In 1846, Silas Wright spoke of belonging to \"the Republican\r\nparty;\" and, in 1848, Horace Greeley suggested \"Taylor Republicans\" as\r\na substitute for Whigs. But for twenty years the name had practically\r\nfallen into disuse, and old questions associated with it had died out\r\nof popular memory.\r\n\r\nAfter full conferences between the Whig and Republican state\r\ncommittees, calls were issued for two state conventions to meet at\r\nSyracuse on September 26. This meant an opportunity for the formal\r\nunion of all anti-slavery voters. Of the two hundred and fifty-six\r\ndelegates allotted to the Republican convention, over two hundred\r\nassembled, with Reuben E. Fenton as their presiding officer. Fenton,\r\nthen thirty-six years old, was serving his first term in Congress. He\r\nwas a man of marked intellectual vigour, unquestioned courage, and\r\nquiet courtesy, whose ability to control men was to give him, within a\r\nfew years, something of the influence possessed by Thurlow Weed as a\r\nmanaging politician, with this difference, perhaps, that Fenton\r\ntrusted more to the prevalence of ideas for which he stood. He kept\r\nstep with progress. His reason for being a Barnburner, unlike that of\r\nJohn A. Dix,[462] grew out of an intense hatred of slavery, and after\r\nthe historic break in 1847, he never again, with full-heartedness,\r\nco-operated with the Democratic party. Fenton studied law, and, for a\r\ntime, practised at the bar, but if the dream and highest ambition of\r\nhis youth were success in the profession, his natural love for trade\r\nand politics quickly gained the ascendant. It is doubtful if he would\r\nhave become a leading lawyer even in his own vicinage, for he showed\r\nlittle real capacity for public speaking. Indeed, he was rather a dull\r\ntalker. The _Globe_, during his ten years in Congress, rarely reveals\r\nhim as doing more than making or briefly sustaining a motion, and,\r\nalthough these frequently occurred at the most exciting moments of\r\npartisan discussion, showing that he was carefully watching, if not\r\nfearlessly directing affairs, it is evident that for the hard blows in\r\ndebate he relied as much as Weed did upon the readiness of other\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 462: \"He never became unduly excited about slavery. He had\r\nno sympathy for the religious or sentimental side of abolitionism, nor\r\nwas he moved by the words of the philanthropists, preachers, or poets\r\nby whom the agitation was set ablaze and persistently fanned. He\r\nprobably regarded it as an evil of less magnitude than several others\r\nthat threatened the country.\"--Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_,\r\nVol. 1, p. 338.]\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, who had represented only a meagre minority of the voters of\r\nthe State since the Know-Nothing defection, now responded to the call\r\nwith a full quota of delegates, and elected John A. King president.\r\nKing was nearly double the age of Fenton. He had been a lieutenant of\r\ncavalry in the War of 1812 and an opponent of DeWitt Clinton in the\r\nearly twenties. The two men presented a broad contrast, yet King\r\nrepresented the traditions of the past along the same lines that\r\nFenton represented the hopes of the future. One looked his full age,\r\nthe other appeared younger than he was, but both were serious.\r\nWhatever their aspirations, they existed without rivalry or\r\nill-feeling, the desire for the success of their principles alone\r\nanimating leaders and followers.\r\n\r\nEach convention organised separately, and, after adopting platforms\r\nand dividing their tickets equally between men of Whig and Democratic\r\nantecedents, conference committees of sixteen were appointed, which\r\nreported that the two bodies should appoint committees of sixteen on\r\nresolutions and of thirty-two on nominations. These committees having\r\nquickly agreed to what had already been done, the Whigs marched in a\r\nbody to the hall of the Republican convention, the delegates rising\r\nand greeting them with cheers and shouts of welcome as they took the\r\nseats reserved for them in the centre of the room.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was one of profound rejoicing. The great coalition which\r\nwas to stand so strong and to work such wonders during the next\r\nhalf-century doubtless had a period of feebleness in the first months\r\nof its existence; but never in its history has it had stronger or more\r\ninfluential men in its ranks, or abler and more determined leaders to\r\ndirect its course. Horace Greeley reported its platform, demanding\r\nthat Congress expressly prohibit slavery in the territories, and\r\ncondemning the doctrines and methods of the Know-Nothings; John A.\r\nKing, Edwin D. Morgan, and Reuben E. Fenton, destined to lead it to\r\nvictory as its candidate for governor, sat upon the stage; Henry J.\r\nRaymond occupied a delegate's seat; and, back of the scenes, stood the\r\ngreat manager, Thurlow Weed, who had conferred with the Free-soil\r\nleaders, and anticipated and arranged every detail. Present in spirit,\r\nthough absent in body, was William H. Seward, who, within a few weeks,\r\nput himself squarely at the head of the new organisation in a speech\r\nthat was read by more than half a million voters.\r\n\r\nAfter the enthusiasm had subsided the two chairmen, John A. King and\r\nReuben E. Fenton, standing side by side, called the joint convention\r\nto order. This was the signal for more cheering. One delegate declared\r\nthat not being quite sure which convention he ought to attend, he had\r\napplied to Seward, who wrote him it didn't make any difference. \"You\r\nwill go in by two doors, but you will all come out through one.\" Then\r\neverything went by acclamation. Speaker Littlejohn of the Assembly\r\nmoved that the two conventions ratify the platforms passed by each\r\nconvention; Elbridge G. Spaulding moved that the presidents of the two\r\nconventions appoint a state central committee; and John A. King moved\r\nthat the names of the candidates, at the head of whom was Preston King\r\nfor secretary of state, be given to the people of the State as the\r\n\"Republican Ticket.\" Only when an effort was made to procure the\r\nindorsement of liquor prohibition did the convention show its teeth.\r\nThe invitation, it was argued, included all men who were disposed to\r\nunite in resisting the aggressions and the diffusion of slavery, and a\r\nmajority, by a ringing vote, declared it bad faith to insist upon a\r\nmatter for which the convention was not called and upon which it was\r\nnot unanimous.\r\n\r\nThe Know-Nothing state convention met at Auburn on September 26. It\r\nwas no longer a secret society. The terrors surrounding its mysterious\r\nmachinery had vanished with the exposure of its secrets and the\r\nexploiting of its methods. It was now holding open political\r\nconventions and adopting political platforms under the title of the\r\nAmerican party; and, as in other political organisations, the slavery\r\nquestion provoked hot controversies and led to serious breaks in its\r\nranks. At its national council, held at Philadelphia in the preceding\r\nJune, the New York delegation, controlled by the Silver-Gray faction\r\nwhich forced Daniel Ullman's nomination for governor in 1854, had\r\njoined the Southern delegates in carrying a pro-slavery resolution\r\nabandoning further efforts to restore the Missouri Compromise. In this\r\naction the anti-slavery members of other Northern States, led with\r\ngreat ability and courage by Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, refused to\r\nacquiesce, preferring to abandon the Order rather than sacrifice their\r\nprinciples. The contest in New York was renewed at the state council,\r\nheld at Binghamton on August 28; and, after a bitter session, a\r\nmajority resolved that slavery should derive no extension from the\r\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise. The convention at Auburn now took\r\nsimilar ground. It was not a great victory for the anti-slavery wing\r\nof the party; but it disproved the assurances of their delegates that\r\nthe Americans of New York would uphold the pro-slavery action at\r\nPhiladelphia, while the fervent heat of the conflict melted the zeal\r\nof thousands of anti-Nebraska Know-Nothings, who soon found their way\r\ninto the Republican party.\r\n\r\nBut the main body of the Americans, crushed as were its hopes of\r\nnational unity, was still powerful. It put a ticket into the field,\r\nheaded by Joel T. Headley for secretary of state, and greatly\r\nstrengthened by George F. Comstock of Syracuse for judge of the Court\r\nof Appeals. Headley was a popular and prolific writer. He had been\r\neducated for the ministry at Union College and Auburn Theological\r\nSeminary, but his pen paid better than the pulpit, and he soon settled\r\ndown into a writer of melodramatic biography, of which _Napoleon and\r\nHis Marshals_ attained, perhaps, the greatest popularity. Possibly\r\nlittle interest now clings to his books, which ordinarily rest on the\r\nhigh shelf with Abbott's _History of Napoleon_; but, in their day, it\r\nwas far pleasanter to read the entertaining and dramatic pages of\r\nHeadley, with their impassioned, stirring pictures of war and heroism,\r\nthan the tame, tedious biographies that then filled the libraries.\r\nHeadley's _History of the War of 1812_ immediately preceded his\r\nentrance to the Assembly in 1854, where his cleverness attracted the\r\nattention of his party and led to his selection for secretary of\r\nstate. George F. Comstock, now in his forty-first year, had already\r\nwon an enviable reputation at the Onondaga bar. Like Headley he was a\r\ngraduate of Union College. In 1847, Governor Young had appointed him\r\nthe first reporter for the Court of Appeals, and five years later\r\nPresident Fillmore made him solicitor of the Treasury Department. He\r\nbelonged to the Hards, but he sympathised with the tenets of the young\r\nAmerican party.\r\n\r\nThere were other parties in the field. The Free Democracy met in\r\nconvention on August 7, and the Liberty party, assembling at Utica on\r\nSeptember 12, nominated Frederick Douglass of Monroe, then a young\r\ncoloured man of thirty-eight, for secretary of state, and Lewis Tappan\r\nof New York for comptroller. Douglass' life had been full of romance.\r\nNeither his white father nor coloured mother appears to have had any\r\nidea of the prodigy they brought into the world; but it is certain his\r\nMaryland master discovered in the little slave boy the great talents\r\nthat a hard life in Baltimore could not suppress. Douglass secretly\r\nbegan teaching himself to read and write before he was ten years of\r\nage, and three years after his escape from slavery at the age of\r\ntwenty-one, he completely captured an audience at an anti-slavery\r\nconvention in Nantucket by his brilliant speaking. This gave him\r\nemployment as an agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, and\r\nfour years later brought him crowded audiences, in England, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland.\r\n\r\nFrederick Douglass was a favourite everywhere. He had wit and humour,\r\nand spoke with the refinement of a cultivated scholar. He did not\r\nbecome a narrow and monotonous agitator. The variety of his\r\nintellectual sympathies, controlled by the constancy of a high moral\r\nimpulse, wholly exempted him from the rashness of a conceited zealot;\r\nand, though often brilliant and at times rhetorical, his style was\r\nquiet and persuasive, reaching the reason as easily as the emotions.\r\nComing as he did, out of slavery, at a time when the anti-slavery\r\nsentiment was beginning to be aggressive and popular in New England\r\nand other free States, Douglass seemed to be the Moses of his race as\r\nmuch as Booker T. Washington in these later years. Englishmen raised\r\none hundred and fifty pounds and bought his freedom in 1846. The next\r\nyear, as a Garrisonian disunionist, he began the publication of a\r\nweekly journal in Rochester; but he soon renounced disunionism,\r\nmaintaining that slavery was illegal and unconstitutional. In the year\r\nthe Liberty party nominated him for secretary of state, his publishers\r\nsold eighteen thousand copies of his autobiography, entitled _My\r\nBondage and My Freedom_.\r\n\r\nBefore the campaign was far advanced it became evident that the\r\nRepublican party was not drawing all the anti-slavery elements to\r\nwhich it was thought to be entitled; and, on the 12th of October,\r\nSeward made a speech in Albany, answering the question, \"Shall we form\r\na new party?\" The hall was little more than two-thirds filled, and an\r\nabsence of joyous enthusiasm characterised the meeting. Earnest men\r\nsat with serious faces, thinking of party ties severed and the work of\r\na lifetime apparently snuffed out, with deep forebodings for the\r\nfuture of the new organisation. This was a time to appeal to\r\nreason--not to the emotions, and Seward met it squarely with a\r\nstorehouse of arguments. He sketched the history of slavery's growth\r\nas a political power; he explained that slave-holders were a\r\nprivileged class, getting the better of the North in appropriations\r\nand by the tariff. \"Protection is denied to your wool,\" he said,\r\n\"while it is freely given to their sugar.\" Then he pointed out how\r\nslavery had grasped the territories as each one presented itself for\r\nadmission into the Union--Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and\r\nAlabama, almost at the very outset of the national career; then\r\nFlorida, when acquired from Spain; then as much of the Louisiana\r\nPurchase as possible; then Texas and the territory acquired from\r\nMexico--all the while deluding the North with the specious pretence\r\nthat each successive seizure of free soil was a \"compromise\" and a\r\nfinal settlement of the slavery question. This opened the way to the\r\nmatter in hand--how to meet slavery's aggressiveness. \"Shall we take\r\nthe American party?\" he asked. \"It stifles its voice, and suppresses\r\nyour own free speech, lest it may be overheard beyond the Potomac. In\r\nthe slave-holding States it justifies all wrongs committed against\r\nyou. Shall we unite ourselves to the Democratic party? If so, to\r\nwhich faction? The Hards who are so stern in defending the\r\naggressions, and in rebuking the Administration through whose agency\r\nthey are committed? or the Softs who protest against the aggressions,\r\nwhile they sustain and invigorate the Administration? What is it but\r\nthe same party which has led in the commission of all those\r\naggressions, and claims exclusively the political benefits? Shall we\r\nreport ourselves to the Whig party? Where is it? It was a strong and\r\nvigorous party, honourable for energy, noble achievement, and still\r\nmore noble enterprises. It was moved by panics and fears to emulate\r\nthe Democratic party in its practised subserviency; and it yielded in\r\nspite of your remonstrances, and of mine, and now there is neither\r\nWhig party nor Whig south of the Potomac. Let, then, the Whig party\r\npass. It committed a grievous fault, and grievously hath it answered\r\nit. Let it march off the field, therefore, with all the honours....\r\nThe Republican organisation has laid a new, sound, and liberal\r\nplatform. Its principles are equal and exact justice; its speech open,\r\ndecided, and frank. Its banner is untorn in former battles, and\r\nunsullied by past errors. That is the party for us.\"[463]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 463: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 256. For\r\nfull speech, see _Seward's Works_, Vol. 4, p. 225.]\r\n\r\nWhen the meeting ended the people went out satisfied. The smallness of\r\nthe audience had been forgotten in the clear, homely arguments, and in\r\nthe glow kindled in every heart; nor did they know that the speech\r\nspoken in their hearing would be read and pondered by half a million\r\nvoters within a month. Richard H. Dana pronounced it \"the keynote of\r\nthe new party.\"[464] But though sown in fruitful soil, insufficient\r\ntime was to elapse before election for such arguments to root and\r\nblossom; and when the votes were counted in November, the\r\nKnow-Nothings had polled 146,001, the Republicans 135,962, the Softs\r\n90,518, and the Hards 58,394. Samuel L. Selden, the candidate of the\r\nHards and Softs for judge of the Court of Appeals, had 149,702.\r\nGeorge F. Comstock was also declared elected, having received 141,094,\r\nor nearly 5000 less than Headley for secretary of state. In the\r\nAssembly the Republicans numbered 44, the Know-Nothings 39, and the\r\nHards and Softs 45.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: _Diary of R.H. Dana_, C.F. Adams, _Life of Dana_, Vol.\r\n1, p. 348.]\r\n\r\n\"The events of the election,\" wrote Seward, \"show that the\r\nSilver-Grays have been successful in a new and attractive form, so as\r\nto divide a majority of the people in the cities and towns from the\r\ngreat question of the day. That is all. The rural districts still\r\nremain substantially sound. A year is necessary to let the cheat wear\r\noff.\"[465] To a friend who was greatly alarmed at the success of the\r\nKnow-Nothings, he wrote: \"There is just so much gas in any ascending\r\nballoon. Before the balloon is down, the gas must escape. But the\r\nballoon is always sure not only to come down, but to come down _very\r\nquick_. The heart of the country is fixed on higher and nobler things.\r\nDo not distrust it.\"[466]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: _Ibid._, p. 259.]\r\n\r\nAfter the election, some people held the opinion that the prospect of\r\na united anti-slavery party was not so favourable as it had been at\r\nthe close of 1854; and men were inclined then, as some historians are\r\nnow, to criticise Seward for not forcing the formation of the\r\nRepublican party in New York in 1854 and putting himself at its head\r\nby making speeches in New England and the West as well as in New York.\r\n\"Had Seward sunk the politician in the statesman,\" says Rhodes; \"had\r\nhe vigorously asserted that every cause must be subordinate to Union\r\nunder the banner of opposition to the extension of slavery--the close\r\nof the year would have seen a triumphant Republican party in every\r\nNorthern State but California, and Seward its acknowledged leader. It\r\nwas the tide in Seward's affairs, but he did not take it at the\r\nflood.\"[467]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n2, p. 69. See also p. 68. \"Seward,\" says the historian, \"had the\r\nposition, the ability and the character necessary for the leadership\r\nof a new party. He was the idol of the anti-slavery Whigs.... Perhaps\r\nhis sympathies were heartily enlisted in the movement for a new party\r\nand he was held back by Thurlow Weed. Perhaps he would have felt less\r\ntrammelled had not his senatorship been at stake in the fall election.\r\nThe fact is, however, that the Republican movement in the West and New\r\nEngland received no word of encouragement from him. He did not make a\r\nspeech, even in the State of New York, during the campaign. His care\r\nand attention were engrossed in seeing that members of the Legislature\r\nwere elected who would vote for him for senator.\" On July 27, 1854,\r\nthe New York _Independent_ asked: \"Shall we have a new party? The\r\nleaders for such a party do not appear. Seward adheres to the Whig\r\nparty.\" In the New York _Tribune_ of November 9, Greeley asserted that\r\n\"the man who should have impelled and guided the general uprising of\r\nthe free States is W.H. Seward.\"]\r\n\r\nLooking back into the fifties from the viewpoint of the present, this\r\nsuggestion of the distinguished historian seems plausible. Undoubtedly\r\nThurlow Weed's judgment controlled in 1854, and back of it was thirty\r\nyears of successful leadership, based upon the sagacity of a statesman\r\nas well as the skill of a clever politician. It was inevitable that\r\nWeed should be a Republican. He had opposed slavery before he was of\r\nage. The annexation of Texas met his strenuous resistance, the Wilmot\r\nProviso had his active approval, and he assailed the fugitive slave\r\nlaw and the Nebraska Act with unsparing bitterness. With a singleness\r\nof purpose, not excelled by Seward or Sumner, his heart quickly\r\nresponded to every movement which should limit, and, if possible,\r\nabolish slavery; but, in his wisdom, with Know-Nothings recruiting\r\nmembers from the anti-slavery ranks, and the Whig party confident of\r\nsuccess because of a divided Democracy, he did not see his way safely\r\nto organise the Republican party in New York in 1854. It is possible\r\nhis desire to re-elect Seward to the United States Senate may have\r\nincreased his caution. Seward's re-election was just then a very\r\nimportant factor in the successful coalition of the anti-slavery\r\nelements of the Empire State. Besides, Weed knew very well that defeat\r\nwould put the work of coalition into unfriendly hands, and it might be\r\ndisastrous if a hostile majority were allowed to deal with it\r\naccording to their own designs and their own class interests.\r\nNevertheless, his delay in organising and Seward's failure to lead the\r\nnew party in 1854, left an indelible impression to their injury in the\r\nWest, if not in New York and New England, \"for unto whomsoever much is\r\ngiven, of him shall much be required; and to whom men have committed\r\nmuch, of him they will ask the more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n1856\r\n\r\n\r\nKansas troubles did not subside after the election. The Pierce\r\nadministration found itself harassed by the most formidable opposition\r\nit had yet encountered. Reeder was out of the way for the moment; but\r\nthe Northern settlers, by planning a flank movement which included the\r\norganisation of a state government and an appeal to Congress for\r\nadmission to the Union, proved themselves an enemy much more\r\npertinacious and ingenious than the removed Governor. To aid them in\r\ntheir endeavour, friends sent a supply of Sharpe's rifles, marked\r\n\"books.\" Accordingly, on the 9th of October, 1855, delegates were\r\nelected to a convention which met at Topeka on the 23d of the same\r\nmonth and framed a Constitution prohibiting slavery and providing for\r\nits submission to the people.\r\n\r\nThis practically established a second government. Governor Shannon,\r\nthe successor of Reeder, recognised the action of the fraudulently\r\nchosen territorial Legislature, while the free-state settlers, with\r\nheadquarters at Lawrence, repudiated its laws and resisted their\r\nenforcement. Things could not long remain in this unhappy condition,\r\nand when, at last, a free-state man was killed it amounted to a\r\ndeclaration of hostilities. Immediately, the people of Lawrence threw\r\nup earthworks; the Governor called out the militia; and the\r\nMissourians again crossed the border. By the 1st of December a couple\r\nof regiments were encamped in the vicinity of Lawrence, behind whose\r\nfortifications calmly rested six hundred men, half of them armed with\r\nSharpe's rifles. A howitzer added to their confidence. Finally, the\r\nborder ruffians, who had heard of the breech-loading rifles and\r\nlearned of the character of the men behind them, after dallying for\r\nseveral weeks, recrossed the river and permitted the settlers to\r\nratify the new Constitution. In January, 1856, a governor and\r\nlegislature were chosen, and, in February, the Legislature, meeting at\r\nTopeka, memorialised Congress, asking that Kansas be admitted into the\r\nUnion. Thereupon, Senator Douglas reported a bill providing that\r\nwhenever the people of Kansas numbered 93,420 inhabitants they might\r\norganise a State. Instantly, Senator Seward offered a substitute,\r\nproviding for its immediate admission with the Topeka Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe events leading up to this parliamentary situation had been noisy\r\nand murderous, rekindling a spirit of indignation in the South as well\r\nas in the North, which brought out fiery appeals from the press. The\r\nGeorgia Legislature proposed to appropriate sixty thousand dollars to\r\naid emigration to Kansas. A chivalrous colonel of Alabama who issued\r\nan appeal for three hundred men willing to fight for the cause of the\r\nSouth, began his march from Montgomery with two hundred, having first\r\nreceived a blessing from a Methodist minister and a Bible from a\r\ndivine of the Baptist church. One young lady of South Carolina set the\r\nexample of selling her jewelry to equip men with rifles. The same\r\nspirit manifested itself in the North. Public meetings encouraged\r\narmed emigration. \"The duty of the people of the free States,\" said\r\nthe _Tribune_, \"is to send more true men, more Sharpe's rifles, and\r\nmore howitzers to Kansas.\"[468] William Cullen Bryant wrote his\r\nbrother that \"by the 1st of May there will be several thousand more\r\nfree-state settlers in Kansas. Of course they will go well\r\narmed.\"[469] Henry Ward Beecher, happening to be present at a meeting\r\nin which an orthodox deacon who had enlisted seventy-nine emigrants\r\nasked for more rifles, declared that a Sharpe's rifle was a greater\r\nmoral agency than the Bible, and that if half the guns needed were\r\npledged on the spot Plymouth Church would furnish the rest.[470]\r\nThus, the equipment of Northern emigrants to Kansas became known as\r\n\"Beecher's Bibles.\"[471] Henry J. Raymond said that \"the question of\r\nslavery domination must be fought out on the plains of Kansas.\"[472]\r\nTo add to Northern bitterness, President Pierce, in a special message\r\nto the United State Senate, condemned the emigrant aid societies,\r\nthreatening to call out the army, and approving the acts of the\r\npro-slavery Legislature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 468: New York _Weekly Tribune_, February 2, 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: Parke Godwin, _Life of Bryant_, Vol. 2, p. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 470: New York _Independent_, March 26, 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 471: New York _Independent_, February 7, 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 472: New York _Times_, February 1, 1856.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this excitement, Senator Douglas began the debate on\r\nhis Kansas bill which was destined to become more historic than the\r\noutrages of the border ruffians themselves. Douglas upheld the acts of\r\nthe territorial Legislature as the work of law and order, denouncing\r\nthe Northern emigrants as daring and defiant revolutionists, and\r\ncharging that \"the whole responsibility for all the disturbance rested\r\nupon the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company and its affiliated\r\nsocieties.\"[473] Horace Greeley admitted the force and power of\r\nDouglas' argument, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, the gifted author of\r\n_Uncle Tom's Cabin_, was so profoundly impressed with the matchless\r\norator that she thought it \"a merciful providence that with all his\r\nalertness and adroitness, all his quick-sighted keenness, Douglas is\r\nnot witty--that might have made him too irresistible a demagogue for\r\nthe liberties of our laughter-loving people, to whose weakness he is\r\naltogether too well adapted now.\"[474] The friends of a free Kansas\r\nappreciated the superiority in debate of the Illinois statesman, whose\r\narguments now called out half a dozen replies from as many Republican\r\nsenators. It afforded a fine opportunity to define and shape the\r\nprinciples of the new party, and each senator attracted wide\r\nattention. But the speech of Seward, who took the floor on the 9th of\r\nApril in favour of the immediate admission of Kansas as a State, seems\r\nto have impressed the country as far the ablest. He sketched the\r\nhistory of the Kansas territory; reviewed the sacrifices of its\r\npeople; analysed and refuted each argument in support of the\r\nPresident's policy; and defended the settlers in maintaining their\r\nstruggle for freedom. \"Greeley expressed the opinion of the country\r\nand the judgment of the historian,\" says Rhodes, \"when he wrote to his\r\njournal that Seward's speech was 'the great argument' and stood\r\n'unsurpassed in its political philosophy.'\"[475] The _Times_\r\npronounced it \"the ablest of all his speeches.\"[476] On the day of its\r\npublication the _Weekly Tribune_ sent out 162,000 copies. Seward wrote\r\nWeed that \"the demand for it exceeds what I have ever known. I am\r\ngiving copies away by the thousand for distribution in Pennsylvania,\r\nOhio, and other States.\"[477]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 473: Report of Committee on Territories, U.S. Senate, March\r\n12, 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 474: New York _Independent_, May 1, 1856, Letters from\r\nWashington.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 475: James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n2, p. 130.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 476: New York _Times_, April 9, 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 477: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 270.]\r\n\r\nA month later, on the 19th and 20th of May, came the speech of Charles\r\nSumner, entitled \"The Crime Against Kansas.\" Whittier called it \"a\r\ngrand and terrible philippic.\" Sumner had read it to Senator and Mrs.\r\nSeward, who advised the omission of certain personal allusions to\r\nSenator Butler;[478] but he delivered it as he wrote it, and two days\r\nlater the country was startled by Preston S. Brooks' assault. The\r\nNorth received this outrage with horror as the work of the slave\r\npower. In public meetings, the people condemned it as a violation of\r\nthe freedom of speech and a blow at the personal safety of public men\r\nhaving the courage to express their convictions. \"The blows that fell\r\non the head of the Senator from Massachusetts,\" said Seward, \"have\r\ndone more for the cause of human freedom in Kansas and in the\r\nterritories of the United States than all the eloquence which has\r\nresounded in these halls since the days of Rufus King and John Quincy\r\nAdams.\"[479] The events surrounding the assault--Brooks' resignation,\r\nhis unanimous re-election, his challenge to Burlingame, and his\r\nrefusal to fight in Canada--all tended to intensify Northern feeling.\r\nClose upon the heels of this excitement came news from Kansas of the\r\nburning of Lawrence, the destruction of Osawatomie, the sacking of\r\nfree-state printing offices, and the murder of Northern immigrants. To\r\ncomplete the list of crimes against free speech and freedom, the\r\ncommander of a force of United States troops dispersed the Topeka\r\nLegislature at the point of the bayonet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 478: Statement of William H. Seward, Jr., to the Author.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 479: This speech was made on June 24, 1856.]\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of affairs when the two great political parties\r\nof the country assembled in national convention in June, 1856, to\r\nselect candidates for President and Vice President. At their state\r\nconvention, in January, to select delegates-at-large to Cincinnati,\r\nthe Softs had put themselves squarely in accord with the pro-slavery\r\nwing of their party. They commended the administration of Pierce,\r\napproved the Nebraska Act, and denounced as \"treasonable\" the Kansas\r\npolicy of the Republican party. This was a wide departure from their\r\nposition of August, 1855, which had practically reaffirmed the\r\nprinciples of the Wilmot Proviso; but the trend of public events\r\ncompelled them either to renounce all anti-slavery leanings or abandon\r\ntheir party. Their surrender, however, did not turn their reception at\r\nCincinnati into the welcome of prodigals. The committee on credentials\r\nkept them waiting at the door for two days, and when they were finally\r\nadmitted they were compelled to enter on an equality with the Hards.\r\nHoratio Seymour pleaded for representation in proportion to the votes\r\ncast, which would have given the Softs three-fifths of the delegation,\r\nbut the convention thought them entitled to no advantages because of\r\ntheir \"abolition principles,\" and even refused a request for\r\nadditional seats from which their colleagues might witness the\r\nproceedings. To complete their humiliation the convention required\r\nthem formally to deny the right of Congress or of the people of a\r\nterritory to prohibit slavery in any territory of the United States.\r\nIt was a bitter dose. The Democracy of the Empire State had been\r\naccustomed to control conventions--not to serve them. For twenty years\r\nthey had come with candidates for the Presidency, and if none of\r\ntheir statesmen had been nominated since 1836 they were recognised as\r\nresolute men, bold in diplomacy, ready for any emergency, and as\r\nformidable to their enemies as they were dear to their friends. For\r\nnearly three decades a New Yorker had been in the Cabinet of every\r\nadministration. But the glory of former days had now departed. For\r\ntwelve years the party had been divided and weakened, until, at last,\r\nit had neither presidential candidate to offer nor cabinet position to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nThe leading candidates at Cincinnati were Franklin Pierce, Stephen A.\r\nDouglas, and James Buchanan. Northern delegates had been inclined to\r\nsupport Pierce or Douglas; but since the assault upon Sumner and the\r\ndestruction of Lawrence, the conciliation of the North by the\r\nnomination of a candidate who had not participated in the events of\r\nthe past three years seemed the wisest and safest policy. Buchanan had\r\nbeen minister to England since the birth of the Pierce administration;\r\nand the fact that he hailed from Pennsylvania, a very important State\r\nin the election, strengthened his availability. The Softs recognised\r\nthe wisdom of this philosophy, but, under the leadership of Marcy, who\r\nhad given them the federal patronage for three years, they voted for\r\nthe President, with the hope that his supporters might ultimately\r\nunite with those of Douglas. The Hards, on the contrary, supported\r\nBuchanan. They had little use for Pierce, who had persecuted them.\r\n\r\nOn the first ballot Buchanan had 135 votes, Pierce 122, Douglas 33,\r\nand Cass 5, with 197 necessary to a choice. This made Buchanan's\r\nsuccess probable if his forces stood firm; and as other ballots\r\nbrought him additional votes at the expense of Pierce, his nomination\r\nseemed certain. The Softs, however, continued with Pierce until his\r\nwithdrawal on the fourteenth ballot; then, putting aside an\r\nopportunity to support the winning candidate, they turned to Douglas.\r\nBut to their great surprise, Douglas withdrew at the end of the next\r\nballot, leaving the field to Buchanan. This placed the Softs, who now\r\njoined the Hards because there was no longer any way of keeping apart,\r\nin an awkward position. Seymour, however, gracefully accepted the\r\nsituation, declaring that, although the Softs came into the convention\r\nunder many disadvantages, they desired to do all in their power to\r\nharmonise the vote of the convention and to promote the discontinuance\r\nof factional differences in the great State of New York. Greene C.\r\nBronson, who smiled derisively as he heard this deathbed repentance,\r\ndid not know how soon Horatio Seymour was destined again to command\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\nThe Republican national convention convened at Philadelphia on the\r\n17th of June. Recent events had encouraged Republicans with the hope\r\nof ultimate victory. Nathaniel P. Banks' election as speaker of the\r\nnational House of Representatives on the one hundred and\r\nthirty-seventh ballot, after a fierce contest of two months, was a\r\ngreat triumph; interest in the Pittsburg convention on the 22d of\r\nFebruary had surpassed expectations; and the troubles of \"bleeding\r\nKansas,\" which seemed to culminate in the assault upon Sumner and the\r\ndestruction of Lawrence, had kept the free States in a condition of\r\nprofound excitement. Such brutal outrages, it was thought, would\r\ncertainly discredit any party that approved the policy leading to\r\nthem. Sustained by this hope the convention, in its platform,\r\narraigned the Administration for the conduct of affairs; demanded the\r\nimmediate admission of Kansas into the Union under the Topeka\r\nConstitution; and resolved, amidst the greatest enthusiasm, that \"it\r\nis both the right and duty of Congress to prohibit in the territories\r\nthose twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe selection of a presidential candidate gave the delegates more\r\ntrouble. They wanted an available man who could carry Pennsylvania;\r\nand between the supporters of John C. Fremont and the forces of John\r\nMcLean, for twenty-six years a member of the United States Supreme\r\nCourt, the canvass became earnest and exciting. Finally, on an\r\ninformal ballot, Fremont secured 359 of the 555 votes in the\r\nconvention. William L. Dayton of New Jersey was then nominated for\r\nVice President over Abraham Lincoln, who received 110 votes.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Seward was the logical candidate for President. He\r\nrepresented Republican principles and aims more fully than any man in\r\nthe country, but Thurlow Weed, looking into the future through the\r\neyes of a practical politician, disbelieved in Republican success. He\r\nargued that, although Republicans were sure of 114 electoral votes, it\r\nwas essential to carry Pennsylvania to secure the additional 35, and\r\nthat Pennsylvania could not be carried. This belief was strengthened\r\nafter the nomination of Buchanan, who pledged himself to give fair\r\nplay to Kansas, which many understood to mean a free State. Under\r\nthese conditions Weed advised Seward not to become a candidate, on the\r\ntheory that defeat in 1856 would sacrifice his chances in 1860.\r\n\r\nSeward, as usual, acquiesced in Weed's judgment. \"I once heard Seward\r\ndeclare,\" wrote Gideon Welles, \"that 'Seward is Weed and Weed is\r\nSeward. What I do, Weed approves. What he says, I indorse. We are\r\none.'\"[480] On this occasion, however, it is certain Seward accepted\r\nWeed's judgment with much reluctance. His heart was set upon the\r\nnomination, and his letters reveal disappointment and even disgust at\r\nthe arrangement. \"It is a delicate thing,\" he wrote, on the 27th of\r\nApril, \"to go through the present ordeal, but I am endeavouring to do\r\nso without giving any one just cause to complain of indifference on my\r\npart to the success of the cause. I have shut out the subject itself\r\nfrom conversation and correspondence, and, so far as possible, from my\r\nthoughts.\"[481] But he could not close his ears. \"From all I hear\r\n'availability' is to be indulged next week and my own friends are to\r\nmake the sacrifice,\" he wrote his wife, on June 11, six days before\r\nthe convention opened. \"Be it so; I shall submit with better grace\r\nthan others would.\"[482] Two days later he said: \"It tries my patience\r\nto hear what is said and to act as if I assented, under expectation of\r\npersonal benefits, present and prospective.\"[483]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 480: Gideon Welles, _Lincoln and Seward_, p. 23. \"I am sorry\r\nto hear the remark,\" said the late Chief Justice Chase, \"for while I\r\nwould strain a point to oblige Mr. Seward, I feel under no obligations\r\nto do anything for the special benefit of Mr. Weed. The two are not\r\nand never can be one to me.\"--_Ibid._, p. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 270.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 482: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 277.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 483: _Ibid._, p. 277.]\r\n\r\nWhat especially gravelled Seward was the action of his opponents. \"The\r\nunderstanding all around me is,\" he wrote his wife, on June 14, \"that\r\nGreeley has struck hands with enemies of mine and sacrificed me for\r\nthe good of the cause, to be obtained by the nomination of a more\r\navailable candidate, and that Weed has concurred in demanding my\r\nacquiescence.\"[484] Seward suspected the truth of this \"understanding\"\r\nas to Greeley, but it is doubtful if he then believed Weed had\r\nbetrayed him. Perhaps this thought came later after he heard of\r\nFremont's astonishing vote and learned that the newspapers were again\r\nnominating the Path-finder for a standard-bearer in 1860. \"Seward more\r\nthan hinted to confidential friends,\" wrote Henry B. Stanton, \"that\r\nWeed betrayed him for Fremont.\" Then Stanton tells the story of Weed\r\nand Seward riding up Broadway, and how, when passing the bronze statue\r\nof Lincoln in Union Square, Seward said, \"Weed, if you had been\r\nfaithful to me, I should have been there instead of Lincoln.\"\r\n\"Seward,\" replied Weed, \"is it not better to be alive in a carriage\r\nwith me than to be dead and set up in bronze?\"[485]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 484: _Ibid._, p. 277.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 485: H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 194.]\r\n\r\nHow much Weed's advice to Seward was influenced by the arguments of\r\nopponents nowhere appears, but the disappointment of Democrats and\r\nconservative Americans upon the announcement of Seward's withdrawal\r\nproves that these objections were serious. His views were regarded as\r\ntoo extreme for a popular candidate. It was deemed advisable not to\r\nput in issue either the abolition of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia, or the repeal of the fugitive slave law, and Seward's\r\npronounced attitude on these questions, it was asserted, would involve\r\nthem in the campaign regardless of the silence of the platform. It was\r\nargued, also, that although the Whigs were numerically the largest\r\nportion of the Republican party, a candidate of Democratic antecedents\r\nwould be preferable, especially in Pennsylvania, a State, they\r\ndeclared, which Seward could not carry. To all this Greeley\r\nundoubtedly assented. The dissolution of the firm of Seward, Weed, and\r\nGreeley, announced in Greeley's remarkable letter of November 11,\r\n1854, but not yet made public, had, indeed, taken effect. The result\r\nwas not so patent, certainly not so vitriolic, as it appeared at\r\nChicago in 1860, but Greeley now began insinuating doubts of Seward's\r\npopular strength, exaggerating local prejudices against him, and\r\nyielding to objections raised by his avowed opponents. His hostility\r\nfound no place in the columns of the _Tribune_, but it coloured his\r\nconversations and private correspondence. To Richard A. Dana he wrote\r\nthat Callamer's speech on the Kansas question \"is better than\r\nSeward's, in my humble judgment;\"[486] yet the _Tribune_ pronounced\r\nSeward's \"the great argument\" and \"unsurpassed in political\r\nphilosophy.\" The importance of Pennsylvania became as prominent a\r\nfactor in the convention of 1856 as it did in that of 1860, and\r\nGreeley did not hesitate to affirm Seward's inability to carry it,\r\ndeclaring that such weakness made his nomination fatal to party\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 486: Letters of April 7, 1856.]\r\n\r\nThe opponents of Seward, however, could not have prevented his\r\nnomination had he decided to enter the race. He was the unanimous\r\nchoice of the New York delegation. The mere mention of his name at\r\nPhiladelphia met with the loudest applause. When Senator Wilson of\r\nMassachusetts spoke of him as \"the foremost American statesman,\" the\r\ncheers made further speaking impossible for several minutes. He was\r\nthe idol of the convention as he was the chief figure of his party.\r\nJohn A. King declared that could his name have been presented \"it\r\nwould have received the universal approbation of the convention.\"\r\nRobert Emmet, the son of the distinguished Thomas Addis Emmet, and the\r\ntemporary chairman of the convention, made a similar statement. Even\r\nThurlow Weed found it difficult to prevail upon his friends to bide\r\ntheir time until the next national convention. \"Earnest friends\r\nrefused to forego my nomination,\" Seward wrote his wife on June 17,\r\nthe day the convention opened, \"without my own authority.\"[487]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 487: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 278.]\r\n\r\nWhen the several state conventions convened at Syracuse each party\r\nsought its strongest man for governor. The Hards and the Softs were\r\nfirst in the field, meeting in separate conventions on July 30. After\r\ninviting each other to join in a union meeting they reassembled as one\r\nbody, pledged to support the Cincinnati platform. It was not an\r\noccasion for cheers. Consolidation was the only alternative, with\r\nchances that the ultra pro-slavery platform meant larger losses if not\r\ncertain defeat. In this crisis Horatio Seymour assumed the leadership\r\nthat had been his in 1852, and that was not to be laid down for more\r\nthan a decade. Seymour was now in his prime--still under fifty years\r\nof age. He had become a leader of energy and courage; and, although\r\ndestined for many years to lead a divided and often a defeated\r\norganisation, he was ever after recognised as the most gifted and\r\nnotable member of his party. He was a typical Northern Democrat. He\r\nhad the virtues and foibles that belonged to that character in his\r\ngeneration, the last of whom have now passed from the stage of public\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe effort to secure a Democratic nominee for governor required four\r\nballots. Addison Gardiner, David L. Seymour, Fernando Wood, and Amasa\r\nJ. Parker were the leading candidates. David Seymour had been a steady\r\nsupporter of the Hards. He belonged to the O'Conor type of\r\nconservatives, rugged and stalwart, who seemed unmindful of the\r\nchanging conditions in the political growth of the country. At\r\nCincinnati, he opposed the admission of the Softs as an unjust and\r\nutterly irrational disqualification of the Hards, who, he said, had\r\nalways stood firmly by party platforms and party nominations\r\nregardless of personal convictions. Fernando Wood belonged to a\r\ndifferent type.[488] He had already developed those regrettable\r\nqualities which gave him a most unsavoury reputation as mayor of New\r\nYork; but of the dangerous qualities that lay beneath the winning\r\nsurface of his gracious manner, men as yet knew nothing. Just now his\r\ngubernatorial ambition, fed by dishonourable methods, found support in\r\na great host of noisy henchmen who demanded his nomination. Addison\r\nGardiner was the choice of the Softs. Gardiner had been elected\r\nlieutenant-governor on the ticket with Silas Wright in 1844, and later\r\nbecame an original member of the Court of Appeals, from which he\r\nretired in 1855. He was a serious, simple-hearted, wise man, well\r\nfitted for governor. But Horatio Seymour made up his mind that Parker,\r\nalthough far below Gardiner and David L. Seymour in number of votes,\r\nwould better unite the convention, and upon Gardiner's withdrawal\r\nParker immediately received the nomination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 488: Fernando Wood was a Quaker and a Philadelphian by\r\nbirth. In early youth he became a cigarmaker, then a tobacco dealer,\r\nand later a grocer. At Harrisburg, his first introduction to politics\r\nresulted in a fist-fight with a state senator who was still on the\r\nfloor when Wood left the bar-room. Then he went to New York, and, in\r\n1840, was elected to Congress at the age of twenty-eight. Wood had a\r\nfascinating personality. He was tall and shapely, his handsome\r\nfeatures and keen blue eyes were made the more attractive by an\r\nabundance of light hair which fell carelessly over a high, broad\r\nforehead. But, as a politician, he was as false as his capacity would\r\nallow him to be, having no hesitation, either from principle or fear,\r\nto say or do anything that served his purpose. He has been called the\r\nsuccessor of Aaron Burr and the predecessor of William M. Tweed. In\r\n1858, he organised Mozart Hall, a Democratic society opposed to\r\nTammany.]\r\n\r\nAmasa J. Parker was then forty-nine years of age, an eminent,\r\nsuccessful lawyer. Before his thirty-second birthday he had served\r\nDelaware County as surrogate, district attorney, assemblyman, and\r\ncongressman. Later, he became a judge of the Supreme Court and removed\r\nto Albany, where he resided for forty-six years, until his death in\r\n1890. Parker was a New England Puritan, who had been unusually well\r\nraised. He passed from the study of his father, a Congregational\r\nclergyman, to the senior class at Union College, graduating at\r\neighteen; and from his uncle's law library to the surrogate's office.\r\nAll his early years had been a training for public life. He had\r\nassociated with scholars and thinkers, and in the estimation of his\r\ncontemporaries there were few stronger or clearer intellects in the\r\nState. But his later political career was a disappointment. His party\r\nbegan nominating him for governor after it had fallen into the\r\nunfortunate habit of being beaten, and, although he twice ran ahead of\r\nhis ticket, the anti-slavery sentiment that dominated New York after\r\n1854 kept him out of the executive chair.\r\n\r\nThe Republican state convention assembled at Syracuse on the 17th of\r\nSeptember. A feeling existed that the election this year would extract\r\nthe people from the mire of Know-Nothingism, giving the State its\r\nfirst Republican governor; and confidence of success, mingled with an\r\nunusual desire to make no mistake, characterised the selection of a\r\nnominee for chief executive. Myron H. Clark, a man of the people, had\r\nmade a good governor, but he was too heavily weighted with prohibition\r\nto suit the older public men, who did not take kindly to him. They\r\nturned to Moses H. Grinnell, whose pre-eminence as a large-hearted,\r\npublic-spirited merchant always kept him in sight. Grinnell was now\r\nfifty-three years of age. His broad, handsome face showed an absence\r\nof bigotry and intolerance, while the motives that controlled his life\r\nwere public and patriotic, not personal. Probably no man in New York\r\nCity, since the time John Jay left it, had ever had more admirers. He\r\nwas a favourite of Daniel Webster, who appointed Washington Irving\r\nminister to Spain upon his request. This interest in the famous\r\nauthor, as well as his recent promotion of Dr. Kane's expedition to\r\nthe Arctic seas in search of Sir John Franklin, indicated the broad\r\nphilanthropy that governed his well-ordered life. But he declined to\r\naccept office. The distinguished house that had borne his name for\r\ntwenty-seven years, decided that its senior member could not be\r\nspared, even temporarily, to become governor of the State, and so\r\nGrinnell's official life was limited to a single term in Congress,\r\nalthough his public life may be said to have spanned nearly two-thirds\r\nof his more than three score years and ten.\r\n\r\nGrinnell's decision seemed to leave an open field, and upon the first\r\nballot John A. King received 91 votes, James S. Wadsworth 72, Simeon\r\nDraper 23, Myron H. Clark 22, and Ira Harris 22. Thurlow Weed and the\r\nwheel horses of Whig descent, however, preferring that the young party\r\nhave a governor of their own antecedents, familiar with political\r\ndifficulties and guided by firmness and wisdom, had secretly\r\ndetermined upon King. But Wadsworth, although he quickly felt the\r\ninfluence of their decision, declined to withdraw. Wadsworth was a\r\nborn fighter. In the Free-soil secession of 1847, he proclaimed\r\nuncompromising hostility to the extension of slavery, and he never\r\nchanged his position until death ended his gallant and noble service\r\nin the Civil War.\r\n\r\nWadsworth descended from a notable family. His father, James\r\nWadsworth, a graduate of Yale, leaving his Connecticut home in young\r\nmanhood, bought of the Dutch and of the Six Nations twenty thousand\r\nacres in the Genesee Valley, and became one of the earliest settlers\r\nand wealthiest men in Western New York. He was, also, the most\r\npublic-spirited citizen. He believed in normal schools and in district\r\nschool libraries, and he may properly be called one of the founders of\r\nthe educational system of the State. But he never cared for political\r\noffice. It was said of him that his refusal to accept public place was\r\nas inflexible as his determination to fight Oliver Kane, a well-known\r\nmerchant of New York City, after trouble had occurred at the card\r\ntable. The story, told at the time, was that the two, after separating\r\nin anger, met before sunrise the next morning, without seconds or\r\nsurgeons, under a tall pine tree on a bluff, and after politely\r\nmeasuring the distance and taking their places, continued shooting at\r\neach other until Kane, slightly wounded, declared he had enough.[489]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 489: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n153.]\r\n\r\nJames S. Wadsworth discovered none of his father's aversion to holding\r\noffice. He, also, graduated at Yale and studied law in the office of\r\nDaniel Webster, but he preferred politics and agriculture to the\r\ntroubles of clients, and, although never successful in getting office,\r\nall admitted his fitness for it. He was brave, far-sighted, and formed\r\nto please. He had a handsome face and stately presence. Many people\r\nwho never saw him were strongly attracted to him by sympathy of\r\npolitical opinions and by gratitude for important services rendered\r\nthe country. There was to come a time, in 1862, when these radical\r\nfriends, looking upon him as the Lord's Anointed, and indifferent to\r\nthe wishes of Thurlow Weed and the more conservative leaders, forced\r\nhis nomination for governor by acclamation; but, in 1856, John A. King\r\nhad the weightiest influence, and, on the second ballot, he took the\r\nstrength of Draper, Clark, and Harris, receiving 158 votes to 73 for\r\nWadsworth. It was not soon forgotten, however, that in the memorable\r\nstampede for King, Wadsworth more than held his own.\r\n\r\nJohn Alsop King was the eldest son of Rufus King. While the father was\r\nminister to the court of St. James, the son attended the famous school\r\nat Harrow, had as classmates Lord Byron and Sir Robert Peel, and went\r\nthe usual rounds of continental travel. For nearly four decades he had\r\nbeen conspicuous in public life as assemblyman, senator, congressman,\r\nand in the diplomatic service. Starting as a Federalist and an early\r\nadvocate of anti-slavery sentiments, he had been an Anti-Mason, a\r\nNational Republican, and a Whig. Only when he acted with Martin Van\r\nBuren against DeWitt Clinton did he flicker in his political\r\nconsistency. Although now sixty-eight years old, he was still\r\nrugged--a man of vigorous sense and great public spirit. His\r\ncongressional experience came when the hosts of slavery and freedom\r\nwere marshalling for the great contest for the territory between the\r\nMississippi and the Pacific, and at the side of Preston King he\r\nresisted Clay's compromise measures, especially the fugitive slave\r\nlaw, and warmly supported the admission of California as a free State.\r\n\"I have come to have a great liking for the Kings,\" wrote Seward, in\r\n1850. \"They have withstood the seduction of the seducers, and are like\r\na rock in the defence of the right. They have been tried as through\r\nfire.\"[490] John A. King was not ambitious for public place. He waited\r\nto be called to an office, but he did not wait to be called to join a\r\nmovement which would be helpful to the public. His ear was to the sky\r\nrather than to the ground. He believed Ralph Waldo Emerson's saying:\r\n\"That is the one base thing in the universe, to receive benefits and\r\nrender none.\" Like his distinguished father, he was tolerant in\r\ndealing with men who differed from him, but he never shrank from the\r\nexpression of an opinion because it would bring sacrifice or\r\nostracism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 490: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 140.]\r\n\r\nThe ticket was strengthened by the nomination of Henry R. Selden of\r\nMonroe for lieutenant-governor. Selden belonged to a family that had\r\nbeen prominent for two centuries in the Connecticut Valley. Like his\r\nolder brother, Samuel L. Selden, who lived at Rochester, he was an\r\nable lawyer and a man of great industry. These brothers brought to the\r\nservice of the people a perfect integrity, coupled with a gracious\r\nurbanity that kept them in public life longer than either desired to\r\nremain. One was a Republican, the other a Democrat. Samuel became a\r\npartner of Addison Gardiner in 1825, and Henry, after studying law\r\nwith them, opened an office at Clarkson in the western part of the\r\ncounty. In 1851, Henry became reporter for the Court of Appeals, and\r\nthen, lieutenant-governor. Samuel's public service began earlier. He\r\nbecame judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1831, of the Supreme\r\nCourt in 1847, and of the Court of Appeals in 1856. When he resigned\r\nin 1862, Henry took his place by appointment, and afterward by\r\nelection. Finally, in 1865, he also resigned. The brothers were much\r\nalike in the quality they brought to the public service; and their\r\nwork, as remarkable for its variety as for its dignity, made Samuel an\r\noriginal promoter of the electric telegraph system and Henry a\r\ndefender of Susan B. Anthony when arrested on the charge of illegally\r\nvoting at a presidential election.\r\n\r\nThe Americans nominated Erastus Brooks for governor. He was a younger\r\nbrother of James Brooks, who founded the New York _Express_ in 1836.\r\nThe Brookses were born in Maine, and early exhibited the industry and\r\ncourage characteristic of the sons of the Pine Tree State. At eight\r\nyears of age, Erastus began work in a grocery store, fitting himself\r\nfor Brown University at a night school, and, at twenty, he became an\r\neditor on his brother's paper. His insistence upon the taxation of\r\nproperty of the Catholic Church, because, being held in the name of\r\nthe Bishops, it should be included under the laws governing personal\r\nholdings in realty, brought him prominently before the Americans, who\r\nsent him to the State Senate in 1854. But Brooks' political career,\r\nlike that of his brother, really began after the Civil War, although\r\nhis identification with the Know-Nothings marked him as a man of\r\nforce, capable of making strong friends and acquiring much influence.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the Americans indicated firm faith in their success.\r\nSix months before Brooks' nomination they had named Millard Fillmore\r\nfor President. At the time, the former President was in Europe. On his\r\nreturn he accepted the compliment and later received the indorsement\r\nof the old-line Whigs. Age had not left its impress. Of imposing\r\nappearance, he looked like a man formed to rule. The peculiar tenets\r\nof the Americans, except as exemplified in the career of their\r\ncandidate for governor, did not enter into Fillmore's campaign. He\r\nrested his hopes upon the conservative elements of all parties who\r\ncondemned the repeal of the Missouri Compromise and opposed the\r\nformation of a party which, he declared, had, for the first time in\r\nthe history of the Republic, selected candidates for President and\r\nVice President from the free States alone, with the avowed purpose of\r\nelecting them by the suffrages of one part of the Union to rule over\r\nthe other part.\r\n\r\nThis was also the argument of Buchanan. In his letter of acceptance he\r\nsounded the keynote of his party, claiming that it was strictly\r\nnational, devoted to the Constitution and the Union, and that the\r\nRepublican party, ignoring the historic warning of Washington, was\r\nformed on geographic lines.[491] All this made little impression upon\r\nthe host of Northern men who exulted in the union of all the\r\nanti-slavery elements. But their intense devotion to the positive\r\nutterances of their platform took away the sense of humour which often\r\nrelieves the tension of political activity, and substituted an element\r\nof profound seriousness that was plainly visible in speakers and\r\naudiences. Seward did not hasten into the campaign. Richard H. Dana\r\nwrote, confidentially, that \"Seward was awful grouty.\" It was October\r\n2 when he began speaking. Congress had detained him until August 30,\r\nand then his health was so impaired, it was explained, that he needed\r\nrest. But other lovers of freedom were deeply stirred. The pulpit\r\nbecame a platform, and the great editors spoke as well as wrote.\r\nHenry Ward Beecher seemed ubiquitous; Greeley and Raymond made\r\nextended tours through the State; Bryant was encouraged to overcome\r\nhis great timidity before an audience; and Washington Irving declared\r\nhis intention of voting, if not of speaking, for Fremont.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 491: Horatio Seymour used the same argument with great\r\neffect. \"Another tie which has heretofore held our country together\r\nhas been disbanded, and from its ruins has sprung a political\r\norganisation trusting for its success to sectional prejudices. It\r\nexcludes from its councils the people of nearly one-half of the Union;\r\nit seeks a triumph over one-half our country. The battlefields of\r\nYorktown, of Camden, of New Orleans, are unrepresented in their\r\nconventions; and no delegates speak for the States where rest the\r\nremains of Washington, Jefferson, Marion, Sumter, or Morgan, or of the\r\nlater hero, Jackson. They cherish more bitter hatred of their own\r\ncountrymen than they have ever shown towards the enemies of our land.\r\nIf the language they hold this day had been used eighty years since,\r\nwe should not have thrown off the British yoke; our national\r\nconstitution would not have been formed; and if their spirit of hatred\r\ncontinues, our Constitution and Government will cease to\r\nexist.\"--Seymour at Springfield, Mass., July 4, 1856. Cook and Knox,\r\n_Public Record of Horatio Seymour_, p. 2.\r\n\r\n\"John A. Dix supported the Democratic candidates in the canvass of\r\n1856; he did not, however, take an active part in the contest.\"--Morgan\r\nDix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 1, p. 319.]\r\n\r\nThis campaign also welcomed into political life a young man whose\r\nfirst speech made it plain that a new champion, with bright and\r\nwell-tempered sword, had taken up the cause of freedom with the\r\ncourage of the cavalier. George William Curtis was then thirty-two\r\nyears old. He had already written the Howadji books, which earned him\r\nrecognition among men of letters, and _Prue and I_, which had secured\r\nhis fame as an author. In the campaign of 1856, the people for the\r\nfirst time saw and knew this man whose refined rhetoric, characterised\r\nby tender and stirring appeal, and guided by principle and conviction,\r\nwas, thereafter, for nearly forty years, to be heard at its best on\r\none side of every important question that divided American political\r\nlife. Nathaniel P. Willis, who drove five miles in the evening to hear\r\nhim deliver a \"stump speech,\" thought Curtis would be \"too handsome\r\nand too well dressed\" for a political orator; but when he heard him\r\nunfold his logical argument step by step, occasionally bursting into a\r\nstrain of inspiring eloquence that foreshadowed the more studied work\r\nof his riper years, it taught him that the author was as caustic and\r\nunconstrained on the platform as he appeared in _The Potiphar Papers_.\r\n\r\nCurtis' theme was resistance to the extension of slavery. His wife's\r\nfather, Francis G. Shaw, had stimulated his zeal in the cause of\r\nfreedom; and he treated the subject with a finish and strength that\r\ncame from larger experience and longer observation than a young man of\r\nthirty-two could usually boast. To him, the struggle for freedom in\r\nKansas was not less glorious than the heroic resistance in 1776, and\r\nhe made it vivid by the use of historic associations. \"Through these\r\nvery streets,\" he said, \"they marched who never returned. They fell\r\nand were buried, but they can never die. Not sweeter are the flowers\r\nthat make your valley fair, not greener are the pines that give your\r\nvalley its name, than the memory of the brave men who died for\r\nfreedom. And yet no victim of those days, sleeping under the green\r\nsod, is more truly a martyr of Liberty than every murdered man whose\r\nbones lie bleaching in this summer sun upon the silent plains of\r\nKansas. And so long as Liberty has one martyr, so long as one drop of\r\nblood is poured out for her, so long from that single drop of bloody\r\nsweat of the agony of humanity shall spring hosts as countless as the\r\nforest leaves and mighty as the sea.\"[492]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 492: Edward Cary, _Life of George William Curtis_, p. 113;\r\nNew York _Weekly Tribune_, August 16, 1856.]\r\n\r\nCurtis thought the question of endangering the Union a mere pretence.\r\n\"Twenty millions of a moral people, politically dedicated to Liberty,\r\nare asking themselves whether their government shall be administered\r\nsolely in the interest of three hundred and fifty thousand\r\nslave-holders.\" He did not believe that these millions would dissolve\r\nthe Union in the interest of these thousands. \"I see a rising\r\nenthusiasm,\" he said, in closing; \"but enthusiasm is not an election;\r\nand I hear cheers from the heart, but cheers are not voters. Every man\r\nmust labour with his neighbour--in the street, at the plough, at the\r\nbench, early and late, at home and abroad. Generally we are concerned\r\nin elections with the measures of government. This time it is with the\r\nessential principle of government itself.\"[493]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 493: _Ibid._, August 16, 1856.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the election was not a surprise. Fremont's loss of\r\nPennsylvania and Indiana had been foreshadowed in October, making his\r\ndefeat inevitable, but the Republican victory in New York was more\r\nsweeping than the leaders had anticipated, Fremont securing a majority\r\nof 80,000 over Buchanan, and John A. King 65,000 over Amasa J.\r\nParker.[494] The average vote was as follows: Republican, 266,328;\r\nDemocrat, 197,172; Know-Nothing, 129,750. West and north of Albany,\r\nevery congressman and nearly every assemblyman was a Republican.\r\nReuben E. Fenton, who had been beaten for Congress in 1854 by 1676\r\nvotes, was now elected by 8000 over the same opponent. The Assembly\r\nstood 82 Republicans, 37 Democrats, and 8 Know-Nothings. In the\r\ncountry at large, Buchanan obtained 174 electoral votes out of 296,\r\nbut he failed to receive a majority of the popular vote, leaving the\r\nvanquished more hopeful and not less cheerful than the victors.\r\nFillmore received the electoral vote of Maryland and a popular vote of\r\n874,534, nearly one-half as many as Buchanan and two-thirds as many as\r\nFremont. In other words, he had divided the vote of the North, making\r\nit possible for Buchanan to carry Pennsylvania and Indiana.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 494: John A. King, 264,400; Amasa J. Parker, 198,616;\r\nErastus Brooks, 130,870.--_Civil List, State of New York_ (1887), p.\r\n166.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT\r\n\r\n1857-1858\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the duty of the Legislature of 1857 to elect a successor to\r\nHamilton Fish, whose term as United States senator expired on the 4th\r\nof March. Fish had not been a conspicuous member of the Senate; but\r\nhis great wisdom brought him large influence at a time when slavery\r\nstrained the courtesy of that body. He was of a most gracious and\r\nsweet nature, and, although he never flinched from uttering or\r\nmaintaining his opinions, he was a lover and maker of peace. In his\r\n_Autobiography of Seventy Years_, Senator Hoar speaks of him as the\r\nonly man of high character and great ability among the leaders of the\r\nRepublican party, except President Grant, who retained the friendship\r\nof Roscoe Conkling.\r\n\r\nThe contest over the senatorship brought into notice a disposition\r\namong Republicans of Democratic antecedents not to act in perfect\r\naccord with Thurlow Weed, a danger that leading Whigs had anticipated\r\nat the formation of the party. Weed's management had been disliked by\r\nanti-slavery Democrats as much as it had been distrusted by a portion\r\nof the Whig party, and, although political associations now brought\r\nthem under one roof, they did not accept him as a guiding or\r\ncontrolling spirit. This disposition manifested itself at the state\r\nconvention in the preceding September; and to allay any bitterness of\r\nfeeling which the nomination of John A. King might occasion, it was\r\nprovided that, in the event of success, the senator should be of\r\nDemocratic antecedents. The finger of fate then pointed to Preston\r\nKing. He had resisted the aggressions of the slave power, and in the\r\nformation of the Republican party his fearless fidelity to its\r\ncornerstone principle made him doubly welcome in council; but when\r\nthe Legislature met, other aspirants appeared, prominent among whom\r\nwere Ward Hunt, James S. Wadsworth, and David Dudley Field.\r\n\r\nHunt, who was destined to occupy a place on the Court of Appeals, and,\r\nsubsequently, on the Supreme Court of the United States, had taken\r\nlittle interest in politics. He belonged to the Democratic party, and,\r\nin 1839, had served one term in the Assembly; but his consistent\r\ndevotion to Free-soilism, and his just and almost prescient\r\nappreciation of the true principles of the Republican party, gave him\r\ngreat prominence in the ranks of the young organisation and created a\r\nstrong desire to send him to the United States Senate. Hunt was\r\nanxious and Wadsworth active. The latter's supporters, standing for\r\nhim as their candidate for governor, had forced the agreement of the\r\nyear before, and they now demanded that he become senator; but in the\r\ninterest of harmony, both finally withdrew in favour of David Dudley\r\nField.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration of an historic name did not yet belong to the Field\r\nfamily. The projector of the Atlantic cable, the future justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, and the eminent New York editor,\r\nhad not taken their places among the most gifted of the land, but\r\nDavid Dudley's activity in the Free-soil contests had made him as\r\nconspicuous a member of the new party as his celebrated Code of Civil\r\nProcedure, passed by the Legislature of 1848, had distinguished him in\r\nhis profession. Promotion did not move his way, however. Thurlow Weed\r\ninsisted upon Preston King. It is likely the Albany editor had not\r\nforgotten that Field, acting for George Opdyke, a millionaire client,\r\nhad sued him for libel, and that, although the jury disagreed, the\r\nexciting trial had crowded the courtroom for nineteen days and cost\r\nseventeen thousand dollars; but Weed did not appeal to Field's record,\r\nsince he claimed the agreement at the state convention included John\r\nA. King for governor and Preston King for senator, and to avoid\r\ncontroversy he adroitly consented to leave the matter to Republican\r\nlegislators of Democratic antecedents, who decided in favour of King.\r\nThis ended the contest, the caucus giving King 65 votes and Hunt 17.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, events gave the Republican party little encouragement in New\r\nYork. Public interest in Kansas had largely died out, and, although\r\nthe Dred Scott decision, holding inferentially that the Constitution\r\ncarried with it the right and power to hold slaves everywhere, had\r\nstartled the nation, leading press, pulpit, and public meetings to\r\ndenounce it as a blow at the rights of States and to the rights of\r\nman, yet the Democrats carried the State in November, electing Gideon\r\nJ. Tucker secretary of state, Sanford E. Church comptroller, Lyman\r\nTremaine attorney-general, and Hiram Denio to the Court of Appeals. It\r\nwas not a decisive victory. The Know-Nothings, who held the balance of\r\npower, involuntarily contributed a large portion of their strength to\r\nthe Democratic party, giving it an aggregate vote of 194,000 to\r\n175,000 for the Republicans, and reducing the vote of James O. Putnam,\r\nof Buffalo, the popular American candidate for secretary of state, to\r\nless than 67,000, or one-half the number polled in the preceding year.\r\n\r\nOther causes contributed to the apparent decrease of Republican\r\nstrength. The financial disturbance of 1857 appeared with great\r\nsuddenness in August. There had been fluctuations in prices, with a\r\ngeneral downward tendency, but when the crisis came it was a surprise\r\nto many of the most watchful financiers. Industry and commerce were\r\nless affected than in 1837, but the failures, representing a larger\r\namount of capital than those of any other year in the history of the\r\ncountry up to 1893, astonished the people, associating in the public\r\nmind the Democratic charge of Republican extravagance with the general\r\ncry of hard times.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the cause of defeat, the outlook for the Republicans\r\nagain brightened when Stephen A. Douglas opposed President Buchanan's\r\nLecompton policy. The Kansas Lecompton Constitution was the work of a\r\nrump convention controlled by pro-slavery delegates who declared that\r\n\"the right of property is before and higher than any constitutional\r\nsanction, and the right of the owner of a slave to such slave and its\r\nincrease is as inviolable as the right of the owner of any property\r\nwhatever.\" To secure its approval by the people it was ingeniously\r\narranged that the vote taken in December, 1857, should be \"for the\r\nconstitution with slavery\" or \"for the constitution without slavery,\"\r\nso that in any event the constitution, with its objectionable section,\r\nwould become the organic law. This shallow scheme, hatched in the\r\nSouth to fix slavery upon a territory that had already declared for\r\nfreedom by several thousand majority, obtained the support of the\r\nPresident. Douglas immediately pronounced it \"a trick\" and \"a fraud\r\nupon the rights of the people.\"[495] The breach between the Illinois\r\nSenator and the Administration thus became complete.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 495: This debate occurred December 22, 1857.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, the governor of Kansas convened the territorial legislature\r\nin an extra session, which provided for a second election in January,\r\n1858. The December election had stood: for the constitution with\r\nslavery, 6226; for the constitution without slavery, 569. Of these\r\n2720 were subsequently shown to be fraudulent. The January election\r\nstood: for the constitution with slavery, 138; for the constitution\r\nwithout slavery, 24; against the constitution, 10,226. The President,\r\naccepting the \"trick election,\" as Douglas called it, in which the\r\nfree-state men declined to participate, forwarded a copy of the\r\nconstitution to Congress, and, in spite of Douglas, it passed the\r\nSenate. An amendment in the House returned it to the people with the\r\npromise, if accepted, of a large grant of government land; but the\r\nelectors spurned the bribe--the free-state men, at a third election\r\nheld on August 2, 1858, rejecting the constitution by 11,000 out of\r\n13,000 votes.\r\n\r\nThis ended the Lecompton episode, but it was destined to leave a\r\nbreach in the ranks of the Democrats big with consequences. Stephen\r\nA. Douglas was now the best known and most popular man in the North,\r\nand his popular sovereignty doctrine, as applied to the Lecompton\r\nConstitution, seemed so certain of settling the slavery question in\r\nthe interest of freedom that leading Republicans of New York, notably\r\nHenry J. Raymond and Horace Greeley, not only favoured the return of\r\nDouglas to the Senate unopposed by their own party, but seriously\r\nconsidered the union of Douglas Democrats and Republicans. It was even\r\nsuggested that Douglas become the Republican candidate for President.\r\nThis would head off Seward and please Greeley, whose predilection for\r\nan \"available\" candidate was only equalled by his growing distrust of\r\nthe New York Senator. The unanimous nomination of Abraham Lincoln for\r\nUnited States senator and his great debate with Douglas, disclosing\r\nthe incompatibility between Douglasism and Republicanism, abruptly\r\nended this plan; but the plausible assumption that the inhabitants of\r\na territory had a natural right to establish, as well as prohibit,\r\nslavery had made such a profound impression upon Northern Democrats\r\nthat they did not hesitate to approve the Douglas doctrine regardless\r\nof its unpopularity in the South.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1858, candidates for governor were nominated in New\r\nYork. The Republican convention, convened at Syracuse on the 8th of\r\nSeptember, like its predecessor in 1856, was divided into Weed and\r\nanti-Weed delegates. The latter, composed of Know-Nothings, Radicals\r\nof Democratic antecedents, and remnants of the prohibition party,\r\nwanted Timothy Jenkins for governor. Jenkins was a very skilful\r\npolitical organiser. He had served Oneida County as district attorney\r\nand for six years in Congress, and he now had the united support of\r\nmany men who, although without special influence, made a very\r\nformidable showing. But Weed was not looking in that direction. His\r\nearliest choice was Simeon Draper of New York City, whom he had thrust\r\naside two years before, and when sudden financial embarrassment\r\nrendered Draper unavailable, he encouraged the candidacy of James H.\r\nCook of Saratoga until Jenkins' strength alarmed him. Then he took up\r\nEdwin D. Morgan, and for the first time became a delegate to a state\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nWeed found a noisy company at Syracuse. Horace Greeley as usual was in\r\na receptive mood. The friends of George Patterson thought it time for\r\nhis promotion. Alexander S. Diven of Elmira, a state senator and\r\nforceful speaker, who subsequently served one term in Congress, had\r\nseveral active, influential backers, while John A. King's friends\r\nfeebly resisted his retirement. The bulk of the Americans opposed\r\nEdwin D. Morgan because of his broad sympathies with foreign-born\r\ncitizens; but Weed clung to him, and on the first ballot he received\r\n116 of the 254 votes. Jenkins got 51 and Greeley 3. On the next ballot\r\none of Greeley's votes went to Jenkins, who received 52 to 165 for\r\nMorgan. Robert Campbell of Steuben was then nominated for\r\nlieutenant-governor by acclamation and Seward's senatorial course\r\nunqualifiedly indorsed.\r\n\r\nEdwin D. Morgan was in his forty-eighth year. He had been alderman,\r\nmerchant, and railroad president; for four years in the early fifties\r\nhe served as a state senator; more recently, he had acted as chairman\r\nof the Republican state committee and of the Republican national\r\nconvention. Weed did not have Morgan's wise, courageous course as war\r\ngovernor, Union general, and United States senator to guide him, but\r\nhe knew that his personal character was of the highest, his public\r\nlife without stain, and that he had wielded the power of absolute\r\ndisinterestedness. Morgan was a fine specimen of manhood. He stood\r\nperfectly erect, with well poised head, his large, lustrous eyes\r\ninviting confidence; and the urbanity of his manner softening the\r\nanswers that showed he possessed a mind of his own. No man among his\r\ncontemporaries had a larger number of devoted friends. He was a New\r\nEnglander by birth. More than one person of his name and blood in\r\nConnecticut was noted for public spirit, but none developed greater\r\ncourage, or evidenced equal sagacity and efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks before the convention, the Americans talked of a\r\nfusion ticket with the Republicans, and to encourage the plan both\r\nstate conventions met at the same time and place. In sentiment they\r\nwere in substantial accord, and men like Washington Hunt, the former\r\ngovernor, and James O. Putnam, hoped for union. Hunt had declined to\r\njoin the Republican party at its formation, and, in 1856, had followed\r\nFillmore into the ranks of the Americans; but their division in 1857\r\ndisgusted him, and, with Putnam and many others, he was now favourable\r\nto a fusion of the two parties. After conferring for two days,\r\nhowever, the Republicans made the mistake of nominating candidates for\r\ngovernor and lieutenant-governor before agreeing upon a division of\r\nthe offices, at which the Americans took offence and put up a separate\r\nticket, with Lorenzo Burrows for governor. Burrows was a man of\r\nconsiderable force of character, a native of Connecticut, and a\r\nresident of Albion. He had served four years in Congress as a Whig,\r\nand in 1855 was elected state comptroller as a Know-Nothing.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the fusionists greatly pleased the Democrats, who, in\r\nspite of the bitter contest for seats in the New York City delegation,\r\nexhibited confidence and some enthusiasm at their state convention on\r\nSeptember 15. The Softs, led by Daniel E. Sickles, represented\r\nTammany; the Hards, marshalled by Fernando Wood, were known as the\r\ncustom-house delegation. In 1857, the city delegates had been evenly\r\ndivided between the two factions; but this year the Softs, confident\r\nof their strength, insisted upon having their entire delegation\r\nseated, and, on a motion to make Horatio Seymour temporary chairman,\r\nthey proved their control by a vote of 54 to 35. The admission of\r\nTammany drew a violent protest from Fernando Wood and his delegates,\r\nwho then left the convention in a body amidst a storm of hisses and\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\nA strong disposition existed to nominate Seymour for governor. Having\r\nbeen thrice a candidate and once elected, however, he peremptorily\r\ndeclined to stand. This left the way open to Amasa J. Parker, an\r\nexceptionally strong candidate, but one who had led the ticket to\r\ndefeat in 1856. John J. Taylor of Oswego, whose congressional career\r\nhad been limited to a single term because of his vote for the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill in 1854, became the nominee for lieutenant-governor\r\nby acclamation. In its platform, the convention very cunningly\r\nresolved that it was \"content\" to have the American people judge\r\nPresident Buchanan's administration by its acts, and that it \"hailed\r\nwith satisfaction\" the fact that the people of Kansas had settled the\r\nLecompton question by practically making the territory a free State.\r\n\r\nThus Parker stood for Buchanan and popular sovereignty, while the\r\nRepublicans denounced the Lecompton trick as a wicked scheme to\r\nsubvert popular sovereignty. It was a sharp issue. The whole power of\r\nthe Administration had been invoked to carry out the Lecompton plan,\r\nand New York congressmen were compelled to support it or be cast\r\naside. But in their speeches, Parker and his supporters sought to\r\nminimise the President's part and to magnify the Douglas doctrine. It\r\nwas an easy and plausible way of settling the slavery question, and\r\none which commended itself to those who wished it settled by the\r\nDemocratic party. John Van Buren's use of it recalled something of the\r\ninfluence and power that attended his speeches in the Free-soil\r\ncampaign of 1848. Since that day he had been on too many sides,\r\nperhaps, to command the hearty respect of any, but he loved fair play,\r\nwhich the Lecompton scheme had outraged, and the application of the\r\ndoctrine that seemed to have brought peace and a free State to the\r\npeople appealed to him as a correct principle of government that must\r\nmake for good. He presented it in the clear, impassioned style for\r\nwhich he was so justly noted. His speeches contained much that did not\r\nbelong in the remarks of a statesman; but, upon the question of\r\npopular sovereignty, as illustrated in Kansas, John Van Buren prepared\r\nthe way in New York for the candidacy and coming of Douglas in 1860.\r\n\r\nRoscoe Conkling, now for the first time a candidate for Congress,\r\nexhibited something of the dexterity and ability that characterised\r\nhis subsequent career. The public, friends and foes, did not yet\r\njudge him by a few striking and picturesque qualities, for his vanity,\r\nimperiousness, and power to hate had not yet matured, but already he\r\nwas a close student of political history, and of great capacity as an\r\norator. The intense earnestness of purpose, the marvellous power of\r\nrapidly absorbing knowledge, the quickness of wit, and the firmness\r\nwhich Cato never surpassed, marked him then, as afterward upon the\r\nfloor of Congress, a mighty power amidst great antagonists. Perhaps\r\nhis anger was not so quickly excited, nor the shafts of his sarcasm so\r\nbarbed and cruel, but his speeches--dramatic, rhetorical, with the\r\never-present, withering sneer--were rapidly advancing him to\r\nleadership in central New York. A quick glance at his tall, graceful\r\nform, capacious chest, and massive head, removed him from the class of\r\nordinary persons. Towering above his fellows, he looked the patrician.\r\nIt was known, too, that he had muscle as well as brains. Indeed, his\r\nnomination to Congress had been influenced somewhat by the recent\r\nassault on Charles Sumner. \"Preston Brooks won't hurt him,\" said the\r\nleader of the Fifth Ward, in Utica.[496]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 496: Alfred R. Conkling, _Life and Letters of Roscoe\r\nConkling_, p. 77.]\r\n\r\nThe keynote of the campaign, however, was not spoken until Seward made\r\nhis historic speech at Rochester on October 25. The October success in\r\nPennsylvania had thrilled the Republicans; and the New York election\r\npromised a victory like that of 1856. Whatever advantage could be\r\ngained by past events and future expectations was now Seward's.\r\nLincoln's famous declaration, \"I believe this government cannot endure\r\npermanently half slave and half free,\" had been uttered in June, and\r\nhis joint debate with Douglas, concluded on October 15, had cleared\r\nthe political atmosphere, making it plain that popular sovereignty was\r\nnot the pathway for Republicans to follow. Seward's utterance,\r\ntherefore, was to be the last word in the campaign.\r\n\r\nIt was not entirely clear just what this utterance would be. Seward\r\nhad shown much independence of late. In the preceding February his\r\ncourse on the army bill caused severe comment. Because of\r\ndifficulties with the Mormons in Utah it was proposed to increase the\r\narmy; but Republicans objected, believing the additional force would\r\nbe improperly used in Kansas. Seward, however, spoke and voted for the\r\nbill. \"He is perfectly bedevilled,\" wrote Senator Fessenden; \"he\r\nthinks himself wiser than all of us.\"[497] Later, in March, he caught\r\nsomething of the popular-sovereignty idea--enough, at least, to draw a\r\nmild protest from Salmon P. Chase. \"I regretted,\" he wrote, \"the\r\napparent countenance you gave to the idea that the Douglas doctrine of\r\npopular sovereignty will do for us to stand upon for the\r\npresent.\"[498] Seward did not go so far as Greeley and Raymond, but\r\nhis expressions indicated that States were to be admitted with or\r\nwithout slavery as the people themselves decided. Before, he had\r\ninsisted that Congress had the right to make conditions; now, his\r\nwillingness cheerfully to co-operate with Douglas and other \"new\r\ndefenders of the sacred cause in Kansas\" seemed to favour a new\r\ncombination, if not a new party. In other words, Seward had been\r\nfeeling his way until it aroused a faint suspicion that he was\r\ntrimming to catch the moderate element of his party. If he had had any\r\nthought of harmony of feeling between Douglas and the Republicans,\r\nhowever, the Lincoln debate compelled him to abandon it, and in his\r\nspeech of October 25 he confined himself to the discussion of the two\r\nradically different political systems that divided the North and the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 497: James S. Pike, _First Blows of the Civil War_, p. 379.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 498: Warden, _Life of Chase_, p. 343.]\r\n\r\nThe increase in population and in better facilities for internal\r\ncommunication, he declared, had rapidly brought these two systems into\r\nclose contact, and collision was the result. \"Shall I tell you what\r\nthis collision means? They who think it is accidental, unnecessary,\r\nthe work of interested or fanatical agitators, and therefore\r\nephemeral, mistake the case altogether. It is an irrepressible\r\nconflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the\r\nUnited States must and will, sooner or later, become either entirely a\r\nslave-holding nation, or entirely a free labour nation. Either the\r\ncotton and rice fields of South Carolina and the sugar plantations of\r\nLouisiana will ultimately be tilled by free labour, and Charleston and\r\nNew Orleans become marts for legitimate merchandise alone, or else the\r\nrye fields and wheat fields of Massachusetts and New York must again\r\nbe surrendered by their farmers to slave culture and to the production\r\nof slaves, and Boston and New York become once more markets for trade\r\nin the bodies and souls of men.\"[499]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 499: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 351.]\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most impressive and commanding speeches that had\r\never come from his eloquent lips, but there was nothing new in it. As\r\nearly as 1848 he had made the antagonism between freedom and slavery\r\nthe leading feature of a speech that attracted much attention at the\r\ntime, and in 1856 he spoke of \"an ancient and eternal conflict between\r\ntwo entirely antagonistic systems of human labour.\" Indeed, for ten\r\nyears, in company with other distinguished speakers, he had been\r\nringing the changes on this same idea. Only four months before,\r\nLincoln had proclaimed that \"A house divided against itself cannot\r\nstand.\"[500] Yet no one had given special attention to it. But now the\r\ntwo words, \"irrepressible conflict,\" seemed to sum up the antipathy\r\nbetween the two systems, and to alarm men into a realisation of the\r\nreal and perhaps the immediate danger that confronted them.\r\n\"Hitherto,\" says Frederick W. Seward in the biography of his father,\r\n\"while it was accepted and believed by those who followed his\r\npolitical teachings, among his opponents it had fallen upon unheeding\r\nears and incredulous minds. But now, at last, the country was\r\nbeginning to wake up to the gravity of the crisis, and when he pointed\r\nto the 'irrepressible conflict' he was formulating, in clear words, a\r\nvague and unwilling belief that was creeping over every intelligent\r\nNorthern man.\"[501]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 500: _Lincoln-Douglas Debates_, p. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 501: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 352.]\r\n\r\nThe effect was instantaneous. Democratic press and orators became\r\nhysterical, denouncing him as \"vile,\" \"wicked,\" \"malicious,\" and\r\n\"vicious.\" The _Herald_ called him an \"arch-agitator,\" more dangerous\r\nthan Beecher, Garrison, or Theodore Parker. It was denied that any\r\nconflict existed except such as he was trying to foment. Even the New\r\nYork _Times_, his own organ, thought the idea of abolishing slavery in\r\nthe slave States rather fanciful, while the Springfield _Republican_\r\npronounced his declaration impolitic and likely to do him and his\r\nparty harm. On the other hand, the radical anti-slavery papers thought\r\nit bold and commendable. \"With the instinct of a statesman,\" the\r\n_Tribune_ said, \"Seward discards all minor, temporary, and delusive\r\nissues, and treats only of what is final and essential. Clear, calm,\r\nsagacious, profound, and impregnable, showing a masterly comprehension\r\nof the present aspect and future prospects of the great question which\r\nnow engrosses our politics, this speech will be pondered by every\r\nthoughtful man in the land and confirm the eminence so long maintained\r\nby its author.\"[502] James Watson Webb, in the _Courier and Enquirer_,\r\ndeclared that it made Seward and Republicanism one and inseparable,\r\nand settled the question in New York as to who should be the\r\nstandard-bearer in 1860.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 502: New York _Daily Tribune_, October 27, 1858.\r\n\r\n\"Few speeches from the stump have attracted so great attention or\r\nexerted so great an influence. The eminence of the man combined with\r\nthe startling character of the doctrine to make it engross the public\r\nmind. Republicans looked upon the doctrine announced as the\r\nwell-weighed conclusion of a profound thinker and of a man of wide\r\nexperience, who united the political philosopher with the practical\r\npolitician. It is not probable that Lincoln's 'house divided against\r\nitself' speech had any influence in bringing Seward to this position.\r\nHe would at this time have scorned the notion of borrowing ideas from\r\nLincoln; and had he studied the progress of the Illinois canvass, he\r\nmust have seen that the declaration did not meet with general favour.\r\nIn February of this year there had been bodied forth in Seward the\r\npolitician. Now, a far-seeing statesman spoke. One was compared to\r\nWebster's 7th-of-March speech,--the other was commended by the\r\nAbolitionists.\"--James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n2, pp. 344-5.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the election was favourable to the Republicans, Morgan's\r\nmajority over Parker being 17,440.[503] Ninety-nine members of the\r\nLegislature and twenty-nine congressmen were either Republicans or\r\nanti-Lecompton men. But, compared with the victory of 1856, it was a\r\ndisappointment. John A. King had received a majority of 65,000 over\r\nParker. The _Tribune_ was quick to charge some of this loss to Seward.\r\n\"The clamour against Sewardism lost us many votes,\" it declared the\r\nmorning after the election. Two or three days later, as the reduced\r\nmajority became more apparent, it explained that \"A knavish clamour\r\nwas raised on the eve of election by a Swiss press against Governor\r\nSeward's late speech at Rochester as revolutionary and disunionist.\r\nOur loss from this source is considerable.\" The returns, however,\r\nshowed plainly that one-half of the Americans, following the precedent\r\nset in 1857, had voted for Parker, while the other half, irritated by\r\nthe failure of the union movement at Syracuse, had supported Burrows.\r\nHad the coalition succeeded, Morgan's majority must have been larger\r\nthan King's. But, small as it was, there was abundant cause for\r\nRepublican rejoicing, since it kept the Empire State in line with the\r\nRepublican States of New England, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin,\r\nwhich were now joined for the first time by Pennsylvania, New Jersey,\r\nand Minnesota. Indeed, of the free States, only California and Oregon\r\nhad indorsed Buchanan's administration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 503: Edwin D. Morgan, 247,953; Amasa J. Parker, 230,513;\r\nLorenzo Burrows, 60,880; Gerrit Smith, 5470.--_Civil List, State of\r\nNew York_ (1887), p. 166.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSEWARD'S BID FOR THE PRESIDENCY\r\n\r\n1859-1860\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elections in 1858 simplified the political situation. With the\r\nexception of Pennsylvania, where the tariff question played a\r\nconspicuous part, all the Northern States had disapproved President\r\nBuchanan's Lecompton policy, and the people, save the old-line Whigs,\r\nthe Abolitionists, and the Americans, had placed themselves under the\r\nleadership of Seward, Lincoln, and Douglas, who now clearly\r\nrepresented the political sentiments of the North. If any hope still\r\nlingered among the Democrats of New York, that the sectional division\r\nof their party might be healed, it must have been quickly shattered by\r\nthe fierce debates over popular sovereignty and the African\r\nslave-trade which occurred in the United States Senate in February,\r\n1859, between Jefferson Davis, representing the slave power of the\r\nSouth, and Stephen A. Douglas, the recognised champion of his party in\r\nthe free States.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the Democratic national convention, called\r\nto meet in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 23, 1860, became the\r\ncentre of interest in the state convention, which met at Syracuse on\r\nthe 14th of September, 1859. Each faction desired to control the\r\nnational delegation. As usual, Daniel S. Dickinson was a candidate for\r\nthe Presidency. He believed his friends in the South would prefer him\r\nto Douglas if he could command an unbroken New York delegation, and,\r\nwith the hope of having the delegates selected by districts as the\r\nsurer road to success, he flirted with Fernando Wood until the\r\nlatter's perfidy turned his ear to the siren song of the Softs, who\r\npromised him a solid delegation whenever it could secure his\r\nnomination. Dickinson listened with distrust. He was the last of the\r\nold leaders of the Hards. Seymour and Marcy had left them; but\r\n\"Scripture Dick,\" as he was called, because of his many Bible\r\nquotations, stood resolutely and arrogantly at his post, defying the\r\nmachinations of his opponents with merciless criticism. The Binghamton\r\nStalwart did not belong in the first rank of statesmen. He was neither\r\nan orator nor a tactful party leader. It cannot be said of him that he\r\nwas a quick-witted, incisive, and successful debater;[504] but, on\r\ncritical days, when the fate of his faction hung in the balance, he\r\nwas a valiant fighter, absolutely without fear, who took blows as\r\nbravely as he gave them, and was loyal to all the interests which he\r\nespoused. He now dreaded the Softs bearing gifts. But their evident\r\nfrankness and his supreme need melted the estrangement that had long\r\nexisted between them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 504: \"'Scripture Dick,' whom we used to consider the\r\nsorriest of slow jokers, has really brightened up.\"--New York\r\n_Tribune_, March 17, 1859.]\r\n\r\nIn the selection of delegates to the state convention Fernando Wood\r\nand Tammany had a severe struggle. Tammany won, but Wood appeared at\r\nSyracuse with a full delegation, and for half an hour before the\r\nconvention convened Wood endeavoured to do by force what he knew could\r\nnot be accomplished by votes. He had brought with him a company of\r\nroughs, headed by John C. Heenan, \"the Benicia Boy,\" and fifteen\r\nminutes before the appointed hour, in the absence of a majority of the\r\ndelegates, he organised the convention, electing his own chairman and\r\nappointing his own committees. When the bulk of the Softs arrived they\r\nproceeded to elect their chairman. This was the signal for a riot, in\r\nthe course of which the chairman of the regulars was knocked down and\r\nan intimidating display of pistols exhibited. Finally the regulars\r\nadjourned, leaving the hall to the Wood contestants, who completed\r\ntheir organisation, and, after renominating the Democratic state\r\nofficers elected in 1857, adjourned without day.\r\n\r\nImmediately, the regulars reappeared; and as the Hards from the\r\nup-state counties answered to the roll call, the Softs vociferously\r\napplauded. Then Dickinson made a characteristic speech. He did not\r\nfully decide to join the Softs until Fernando Wood had sacrificed the\r\nonly chance of overthrowing them; but when he did go over, he burned\r\nthe bridges behind him. The Softs were delighted with Dickinson's\r\nbearing and Dickinson's speech. It united the party throughout the\r\nState and put Tammany in easy control of New York City.\r\n\r\nWith harmony restored there was little for the convention to do except\r\nto renominate the state officers, appoint delegates to the Charleston\r\nconvention who were instructed to vote as a unit, and adopt the\r\nplatform. These resolutions indorsed the administration of President\r\nBuchanan; approved popular sovereignty; condemned the \"irrepressible\r\nconflict\" speech of Seward as a \"revolutionary threat\" aimed at\r\nrepublican institutions; and opposed the enlargement of the Erie canal\r\nto a depth of seven feet.\r\n\r\nThe Republican state convention had previously assembled on September\r\n7 and selected a ticket, equally divided between men of Democratic and\r\nWhig antecedents, headed by Elias W. Leavenworth for secretary of\r\nstate. Great confidence was felt in its election until the Americans\r\nmet in convention on September 22 and indorsed five of its candidates\r\nand four Democrats. This, however, did not abate Republican activity,\r\nand, in the end, six of the nine Republican nominees were elected. The\r\nweight of the combined opposition, directed against Leavenworth,\r\ncaused his defeat by less than fifteen hundred, showing that\r\nRepublicans were gradually absorbing all the anti-slavery elements.\r\n\r\nUpon what theory the American party nominated an eclectic ticket did\r\nnot appear, although the belief obtained that it hoped to cloud\r\nSeward's presidential prospects by creating the impression that the\r\nSenator was unable, without assistance, to carry his own State on the\r\neve of a great national contest. But whatever the reason, the result\r\ndeeply humiliated the party, since its voting strength, reduced to\r\nless than 21,000, proved insufficient to do more than expose the\r\nweakness. This was the last appearance of the American party. It had\r\nendeavoured to extend its life and increase its influence; but after\r\nits refusal to interdict slavery in the territories it rapidly melted\r\naway. Henry Wilson, senator and Vice President, declared that he would\r\ngive ten years of his life if he could blot out his membership in the\r\nKnow-Nothing party, since it associated him throughout his long and\r\nattractive public career with proscriptive principles of which he was\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the campaign the country was startled by John Brown's\r\nraid at Harper's Ferry. For two years Brown had lived an uneventful\r\nlife in New York on land in the Adirondack region given him by Gerrit\r\nSmith. In 1851, he moved to Ohio, and from thence to Kansas, where he\r\nbecame known as John Brown of Osawatomie. He had been a consistent\r\nenemy of slavery, working the underground railroad and sympathising\r\nwith every scheme for the rescue of slaves; but once in Kansas, he\r\nreadily learned the use of a Sharpe's rifle. In revenge for the\r\ndestruction of Lawrence, he deliberately massacred the pro-slavery\r\nsettlers living along Pottawatomie creek. \"Without the shedding of\r\nblood there is no remission of sins,\" was a favourite text. His\r\nactivity made him a national character. The President offered $250 for\r\nhis arrest and the governor of Missouri added $3000 more. In 1858, he\r\nreturned East, collected money to aid an insurrection among the slaves\r\nof Virginia, and on October 17, 1859, with eighteen men, began his\r\nquixotic campaign by cutting telegraph wires, stopping trains, and\r\nseizing the national armory at Harper's Ferry. At one time he had\r\ntaken sixty prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe affair was soon over, but not until the entire band was killed or\r\ncaptured. Brown, severely hurt, stood between two of his sons, one\r\ndead and the other mortally wounded, refusing to surrender so long as\r\nhe could fight. After his capture, he said, coolly, in reply to a\r\nquestion: \"We are Abolitionists from the North, come to release and\r\ntake your slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial, conviction, and execution of Brown and his captured\r\ncompanions ended the episode, but its influence was destined to be\r\nfar-reaching. John Brown became idealised. His bearing as he stood\r\nbetween his dead and dying sons, his truth-telling answers, and the\r\nevidence of his absolute unselfishness filled many people in the North\r\nwith a profound respect for the passion that had driven him on, while\r\nhis bold invasion of a slave State and his reckless disregard of life\r\nand property alarmed the South into the sincere belief that his\r\nmethods differed only in degree from the teachings of those who talked\r\nof an irrepressible conflict and a higher law. To aid him in regaining\r\nhis lost position in the South, Stephen A. Douglas proclaimed it as\r\nhis \"firm and deliberate belief that the Harper Ferry crime was the\r\nnatural, logical, and inevitable result of the doctrine and teachings\r\nof the Republican party.\"[505]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 505: _Congressional Globe_, 36th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 553-4\r\n(January 23, 1860).]\r\n\r\nThe sentimentalists of the North generally sympathised with Brown.\r\nEmerson spoke of him as \"that new saint awaiting his martyrdom, and\r\nwho, if he shall suffer, will make the gallows glorious like the\r\ncross.\"[506] In the same spirit Thoreau called him \"an angel of\r\nlight,\" and Longfellow wrote in his diary on the day of the execution:\r\n\"The date of a new revolution, quite as much needed as the old\r\none.\"[507] But the Republican leaders deprecated the affair,\r\ncharacterising it as \"among the gravest of crimes,\" and denying that\r\nit had any relation to their party except as it influenced the minds\r\nof all men for or against slavery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 506: James E. Cabot, _Life of Emerson_, p. 597.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 507: Samuel Longfellow, _Life of Longfellow_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n347.]\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Seward was in Europe at the time of the raid. Early in May,\r\n1859, his friends had celebrated his departure from New York,\r\nescorting him to Sandy Hook, and leaving him finally amidst shouts\r\nand music, bells and whistles, and the waving of hats and\r\nhandkerchiefs. Such a scene is common enough nowadays, but then it was\r\nunique. His return at the close of December, after an absence of eight\r\nmonths, was the occasion of great rejoicing. A salute of a hundred\r\nguns was fired in City Hall Park, the mayor and common council\r\ntendered him a public reception, and after hours of speech-making and\r\nhand-shaking he proceeded slowly homeward amidst waiting crowds at\r\nevery station. At Auburn the streets were decorated, and the people,\r\nregardless of creed or party, escorted him in procession to his home.\r\nFew Republicans in New York had any doubt at that moment of his\r\nnomination and election to the Presidency.\r\n\r\nOn going to Washington Seward found the United States Senate\r\ninvestigating the Harper's Ferry affair and the House of\r\nRepresentatives deadlocked over the election of a speaker. Bitterness\r\nand threats of disunion characterised the proceeding at both ends of\r\nthe Capitol. \"This Union,\" said one congressman, \"great and powerful\r\nas it is, can be tumbled down by the act of any one Southern State. If\r\nFlorida withdraws, the federal government would not dare attack her.\r\nIf it did, the bands would dissolve as if melted by lightning.\"[508]\r\nReferring to the possibility of the election of a Republican\r\nPresident, another declared that \"We will never submit to the\r\ninauguration of a Black Republican President. You may elect Seward to\r\nbe President of the North; but of the South, never! Whenever a\r\nPresident is elected by a fanatical majority of the North, those whom\r\nI represent are ready, let the consequences be what they may, to fall\r\nback on their reserved rights, and say, 'As to this Union we have no\r\nlonger any lot or part in it.'\"[509]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 508: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 441.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 509: _Ibid._, p. 442.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these fiery, disunion utterances, on the 21st of\r\nFebruary, 1860, Seward introduced a bill for the admission of Kansas\r\ninto the Union. After the overwhelming defeat of the Lecompton\r\nConstitution, the free-state men had controlled the territorial\r\nlegislature, repealed the slave code of 1855, and, in the summer of\r\n1859, convened a constitutional convention at Wyandotte. A few weeks\r\nlater the people ratified the result of its work by a large majority.\r\nIt was this Wyandotte Constitution under which Seward proposed to\r\nadmit Kansas, and he fixed the consideration of his measure for the\r\n29th of February. This would be two days after Abraham Lincoln had\r\nspoken in New York City.\r\n\r\nLincoln, whose fame had made rapid strides in the West since his\r\ndebate with Douglas in 1858, had been anxious to visit New York. It\r\nwas the home of Seward, the centre of Republican strength, and to him\r\npractically an unknown land. Through the invitation of the Young Men's\r\nCentral Republican Union he was now to lecture at Cooper Institute on\r\nthe 27th of February. It was arranged at first that he speak in Henry\r\nWard Beecher's church, but the change, relieving him from too close\r\nassociation with the great apostle of abolition, opened a wider door\r\nfor his reception. Personally he was known to very few people in the\r\ncity or State. In 1848, on his way to New England to take the stump,\r\nhe had called upon Thurlow Weed at Albany, and together they visited\r\nMillard Fillmore, then candidate for Vice President; but the meeting\r\nmade such a slight impression upon the editor of the _Evening Journal_\r\nthat he had entirely forgotten it. Thirty years before, in one of his\r\njourneys to Illinois, William Cullen Bryant had met him. Lincoln was\r\nthen a tall, awkward lad, the captain of a militia company in the\r\nBlack Hawk War, whose racy and original conversation attracted the\r\nyoung poet; but Bryant, too, had forgotten him, and it was long after\r\nthe famous debate that he identified his prairie acquaintance as the\r\nopponent of Douglas. Lincoln, however, did not come as a stranger. His\r\nencounter with the great Illinoisan had marked him as a powerful and\r\nlogical reasoner whose speeches embraced every political issue of the\r\nday and cleared up every doubtful point. Well-informed people\r\neverywhere knew of him. He was not yet a national character, but he\r\nhad a national reputation.\r\n\r\nThough Lincoln's lecture was one of a course, the admission fee did\r\nnot restrain an eager audience from filling the commodious hall.\r\n\"Since the day of Clay and Webster,\" said the _Tribune_, \"no man has\r\nspoken to a larger assemblage of the intellect and mental culture of\r\nour city.\"[510] Bryant acted as chairman of the meeting, and other\r\nwell-known men of the city occupied the stage. In his _Life of\r\nLincoln_, Herndon suggests that the new suit of clothes which seemed\r\nso fine in his Springfield home was in such awkward contrast with the\r\nneatly fitting dress of the New Yorkers that it disconcerted him, and\r\nthe brilliant audience dazzled and embarrassed him; but his hearers\r\nthought only of the pregnant matter of the discourse, so calmly and\r\nlogically discussed that Horace Greeley, years afterward, pronounced\r\nit \"the very best political address to which I ever listened, and I\r\nhave heard some of Webster's grandest.\"[511]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 510: New York _Tribune_, February 28, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 511: _Century Magazine_, July, 1891, p. 373. An address of\r\nGreeley written in 1868.]\r\n\r\nLincoln had carefully prepared for the occasion. He came East to show\r\nwhat manner of man he was, and while he evidenced deep moral feeling\r\nwhich kept his audience in a glow, he combined with it rare political\r\nsagacity, notably in omitting the \"house divided against itself\"\r\ndeclaration. He argued that the Republican party was not\r\nrevolutionary, but conservative, since it maintained the doctrine of\r\nthe fathers who held and acted upon the opinion that Congress had the\r\npower to prohibit slavery in the territories. \"Some of you,\" he said,\r\naddressing himself to the Southern people, \"are for reviving the\r\nforeign slave trade; some for Congress forbidding the territories to\r\nprohibit slavery within their limits; some for maintaining slavery in\r\nthe territories through the judiciary; some for the 'great principle'\r\nthat if one man would enslave another, no third man should object,\r\nfantastically called popular sovereignty; but never a man among you is\r\nin favour of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories,\r\naccording to the practice of our fathers who formed the government\r\nunder which we live. You say we have made the slavery question more\r\nprominent than it formerly was. We deny it. We admit that it is more\r\nprominent, but we deny that we made it so. It was not we, but you who\r\ndiscarded the old policy of the fathers.\" Of Southern threats of\r\ndisunion, he said: \"Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you\r\nwill destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and\r\nenforce the Constitution as you please on all points in dispute\r\nbetween you and us. You will rule or ruin in all events.\" Referring to\r\nthe Harper's Ferry episode, he said: \"That affair in its philosophy\r\ncorresponds with the many attempts related in history at the\r\nassassination of kings and emperors. An enthusiast broods over the\r\noppression of a people, until he fancies himself commissioned by\r\nheaven to liberate them. He ventures the attempt which ends in little\r\nelse than his own execution.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln's lecture did not disappoint. He had entertained and\r\ninterested the vast assemblage, which frequently rang with cheers and\r\nshouts of applause as the gestures and the mirth-provoking look\r\nemphasised the racy hits that punctuated the address. \"No man,\" said\r\nthe _Tribune_, \"ever before made such an impression on his first\r\nappeal to a New York audience. He is one of Nature's orators.\"[512]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 512: New York _Tribune_, March 1, 1860.]\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Seward addressed the United States Senate. There is no\r\nevidence that he fixed this date because of the Cooper Institute\r\nlecture. The gravity of the political situation demanded some\r\nexpression from him; but the knowledge of the time of Lincoln's speech\r\ngave him ample opportunity to arrange to follow it with one of his\r\nown, if he wished to have the last word, or to institute a comparison\r\nof their respective views on the eve of the national convention.\r\nHowever this may be, Seward regarded his utterances on this occasion\r\nof the utmost importance. He was the special object of Southern\r\nvituperation. A \"Fire-Eater\" of the South publicly advertised that he\r\nwould be one of one hundred \"gentlemen\" to give twenty-five dollars\r\neach for the heads of Horace Greeley, Henry Ward Beecher, and forty\r\nother prominent Northern leaders in and out of Congress, but for the\r\nhead of Seward his proposed subscription was multiplied twenty fold.\r\nIt is noticeable that in this long list of \"traitors\" the name of\r\nAbraham Lincoln does not appear. It was Seward whom the South expected\r\nthe Republican party would nominate for President, and in him it saw\r\nthe narrow-minded, selfish, obstinate Abolitionist who hated them as\r\nintensely as they despised him. To dispossess the Southern mind of\r\nthis feeling the Auburn statesman now endeavoured to show that if\r\nelected President he would not treat the South unfriendly.\r\n\r\nSeward's speech bears evidence of careful preparation. It was not only\r\nread to friends for criticism, but Henry B. Stanton, in his _Random\r\nRecollections_, says that Seward, before the day of its delivery,\r\nassisted him in describing such a scene in the Senate as he desired\r\nlaid before the public. On his return to Washington, Seward had not\r\nbeen received with a show of friendship by his associates from the\r\nSouth. It was remarked that while Republican senators greeted him\r\nwarmly, \"his Southern friends were afraid to be seen talking to him.\"\r\nOn the occasion of his speech, however, he wished the record to show\r\nevery senator in his place and deeply interested.\r\n\r\nVisitors to the Senate on the 29th of February crowded every available\r\nspot in the galleries. \"But it was on the floor itself,\" wrote Stanton\r\nto the _Tribune_, \"that the most interesting spectacle presented\r\nitself. Every senator seemed to be in his seat. Hunter, Davis, Toombs,\r\nMason, Slidell, Hammond, Clingman, Brown, and Benjamin paid closest\r\nattention to the speaker. Crittenden listened to every word. Douglas\r\naffected to be self-possessed; but his nervousness of mien gave token\r\nthat the truths now uttered awakened memories of the Lecompton\r\ncontest, when he, Seward, and Crittenden, the famous triumvirate, led\r\nthe allies in their attack upon the Administration. The members of the\r\nHouse streamed over to the north wing of the Capitol almost in a\r\nbody, leaving Reagan of Texas to discourse to empty benches, while\r\nSeward held his levee in the Senate.\"[513]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 513: New York _Tribune_, March 1, 1860.]\r\n\r\nSeward lacked the tones, the kindly eye, and the mirth-provoking look\r\nof Lincoln. His voice was husky, his manner didactic, and his physique\r\nunimposing, but he had the gift of expression, and the ability to\r\nformulate his opinions and marshal his facts in lucid sentences that\r\nharmonised with Northern sentiments and became at once the creed and\r\nrallying cry of his party; and, on this occasion, he held the Senate\r\nspellbound for two hours, the applause at one time becoming so long\r\ncontinued that the presiding officer threatened to clear the\r\ngalleries. He was always calm and temperate. But it seemed now to be\r\nhis desire, in language more subdued, perhaps, than he had ever used\r\nbefore, to allay the fears of what would happen should the Republican\r\nparty succeed in electing a President; and, without the sacrifice of\r\nany principle, he endeavoured to outline the views of Republicans and\r\nthe spirit that animated himself. There was nothing new in his speech.\r\nHe avoided the higher law and irrepressible conflict doctrines, and\r\nomitted his former declarations that slavery \"can and must be\r\nabolished, and you and I can and must do it.\" In like manner he failed\r\nto demand, as formerly, that the Supreme Court \"recede from its\r\nspurious judgment\" in the Dred Scott case. But he reviewed with the\r\nsame logic that had characterised his utterances for twenty years, the\r\nrelation of the Constitution to slavery; the influence of slavery upon\r\nboth parties; the history of the Kansas controversy; and the manifest\r\nadvantages of the Union, dwelling at length and with much originality\r\nupon the firm hold it had upon the people, and the certainty that it\r\nwould survive the rudest shocks of faction. Of the Harper's Ferry\r\naffair, Seward spoke with more sympathy than Lincoln. \"While generous\r\nand charitable natures will probably concede that John Brown acted on\r\nearnest, though fatally erroneous convictions,\" he said, \"yet all good\r\ncitizens will nevertheless agree that this attempt to execute an\r\nunlawful purpose in Virginia by invasion, involving servile war, was\r\nan act of sedition and treason, and criminal in just the extent that\r\nit affected the public peace and was destructive of human happiness\r\nand life.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been noted with increasing admiration that Lincoln and Seward,\r\nwithout consultation and in the presence of a great impending crisis,\r\nparalleled one another's views so closely. Each embodied the\r\nconvictions and aspirations of his party. The spirit of an unsectarian\r\npatriotism that characterised Seward's speech proved highly\r\nsatisfactory to the great mass of Republicans. The New York _Times_\r\nrejoiced that its tone indicated \"a desire to allay and remove\r\nunfounded prejudice from the public mind,\" and pronounced \"the whole\r\ntenor of it in direct contradiction to the sentiments which have been\r\nimputed to him on the strength of declarations which he has hitherto\r\nmade.\"[514] Samuel Bowles of the Springfield _Republican_ wrote\r\nThurlow Weed that the state delegation--so \"very marked\" is the\r\nreaction in Seward's favour--would \"be so strong for him as to be\r\nagainst anybody else,\" and that \"I hear of ultra old Whigs in Boston\r\nwho say they are ready to take him up on his recent speech.\"[515]\r\nCharles A. Dana, then managing editor of the _Tribune_, declared that\r\n\"Seward stock is rising,\" and Salmon P. Chase admitted that \"there\r\nseems to be at present a considerable set toward Seward.\" Nathaniel P.\r\nBanks, who was himself spoken of as a candidate, thought Seward's\r\nprospects greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 514: New York _Times_, March 2, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 515: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n260.]\r\n\r\nBut a growing and influential body of men in the Republican party\r\nseverely criticised the speech because it lacked the moral earnestness\r\nof the \"higher law\" spirit. To them it seemed as if Seward had made a\r\nbid for the Presidency, and that the irrepressible conflict of 1858\r\nwas suddenly transformed into the condition of a mild and patient\r\nlover who is determined not to quarrel. \"Differences of opinion, even\r\non the subject of slavery,\" he said, \"are with us political, not\r\nsocial or personal differences. There is not one disunionist or\r\ndisloyalist among us all. We are altogether unconscious of any process\r\nof dissolution going on among us or around us. We have never been more\r\npatient, and never loved the representatives of other sections more\r\nthan now. We bear the same testimony for the people around us here. We\r\nbear the same testimony for all the districts and States we\r\nrepresent.\"\r\n\r\nThis did not sound like the terrible \"irrepressible conflict\" pictured\r\nat Rochester. Wendell Phillips' famous epigram that \"Seward makes a\r\nspeech in Washington on the tactics of the Republican party, but\r\nphrases it to suit Wall street,\"[516] voiced the sentiment of his\r\ncritics. Garrison was not less severe. \"The temptation which proved\r\ntoo powerful for Webster,\" he wrote, \"is seducing Seward to take the\r\nsame downward course.\"[517] Greeley did not vigorously combat this\r\nidea. \"Governor Seward,\" he said, \"has so long been stigmatised as a\r\nradical that those who now first study his inculcations carefully will\r\nbe astonished to find him so eminently pacific and conservative.\r\nFuture generations will be puzzled to comprehend how such sentiments\r\nas his, couched in the language of courtesy and suavity which no\r\nprovocation can induce him to discard, should ever have been denounced\r\nas incendiary.\"[518]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 516: New York _Tribune_, March 22, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 517: _The Liberator_, March 9, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 518: New York _Tribune_, March 2, 1860.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt much of this criticism was due to personal jealousy, or to\r\nthe old prejudice against him as a Whig leader who had kept himself in\r\naccord with the changing tendencies of a progressive people,\r\nalternately exciting them with irrepressible conflicts and soothing\r\nthem with sentences of conservative wisdom; but Bowles, in approving\r\nthe speech because it had brought ultra old Whigs of Boston to\r\nSeward's support, exposed the real reason for the adverse criticism,\r\nsince an address that would capture an old-line Whig, who indorsed\r\nFillmore in 1856, could scarcely satisfy the type of Republicans who\r\nbelieved, with John A. Andrew, that whether the Harper's Ferry\r\nenterprise was wise or foolish, \"John Brown himself is right.\" It is\r\nlittle wonder, perhaps, that these people began to doubt whether\r\nSeward had strong convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nDEAN RICHMOND'S LEADERSHIP AT CHARLESTON\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Democratic national convention opened at Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, on April 23, 1860, Fernando Wood insisted upon the admission\r\nof his delegation on equal terms with Tammany. The supreme question\r\nwas the nomination of Stephen A. Douglas, and the closeness of the\r\ncontest between the Douglas and anti-Douglas forces made New York's\r\nthirty-five votes most important. Wood promised his support, if\r\nadmitted, to the anti-Douglas faction; the Softs, led by Dean\r\nRichmond, encouraged Douglas and whispered kindly words to the\r\nsupporters of James Guthrie of Kentucky. It was apparent that Wood's\r\ndelegation had no standing. It had been appointed before the legal\r\nhour for the convention's assembling in the absence of a majority of\r\nthe delegates, and upon no theory could its regularity be accepted;\r\nbut Wood, mild and bland in manner, made a favourable impression in\r\nCharleston. No one would have pointed him out in a group of gentlemen\r\nas the redoubtable mayor of New York City, who invented surprises,\r\nand, with a retinue of roughs, precipitated trouble in conventions.\r\nHis adroit speeches, too, had won him advantage, and when he pledged\r\nhimself to the ultra men of the South his admission became a necessary\r\nfactor to their success. This, naturally, threw the Softs into the\r\ncamp of Douglas, whose support made their admission possible.[519]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 519: \"The Fernando Wood movement was utterly overthrown in\r\nthe preliminary stages. Several scenes in the fight were highly\r\nentertaining. Mr. Fisher of Virginia was picked out to make the\r\nonslaught, when John Cochrane of New York, who is the brains of the\r\nCagger-Cassidy delegation, shut him off with a point of order.\"--M.\r\nHalstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_, p. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe New York delegation, composed of distinguished business men and\r\nadroit politicians, was divided into two factions, each one fancying\r\nitself the more truly patriotic, public-spirited, and independent.[520]\r\nThe Softs had trapped the Hards into allegiance with the promise of a\r\nsolid support for Dickinson whenever the convention manifested a\r\ndisposition to rally around him--and then gagged them by a rigid unit\r\nrule. This made Dickinson declamatory and bitter, while the Softs\r\nthemselves, professing devotion to Douglas, exhibited an unrest which\r\nindicated that changed conditions would easily change their devotion.\r\nAltogether, it was a disappointing delegation, distrusted by the\r\nDouglas men, feared by the South, and at odds with itself; yet, it is\r\ndoubtful if the Empire State ever sent an abler body of men to a\r\nnational convention. Its chairman, Dean Richmond, now at the height of\r\nhis power, was a man of large and comprehensive vision, and, although\r\nsometimes charged with insincerity, his rise in politics had not been\r\nmore rapid than his success in business. Before his majority he had\r\nbecome the director of a bank, and at the age of thirty-eight he had\r\nestablished himself in Buffalo as a prosperous dealer and shipper.\r\nThen, he aided in consolidating seven corporations into the New York\r\nCentral Railroad--securing the necessary legislation for the\r\npurpose--and in 1853 had become its vice president. Eleven years\r\nlater, and two years before his death, he became its president. In\r\n1860, Dean Richmond was in his forty-seventh year, incapable of any\r\nmeanness, yet adroit, shrewd, and skilful, stating very perfectly the\r\njudgment of a clear-headed and sound business man. As chairman of the\r\nDemocratic state committee, he was a somewhat rugged but an intensely\r\ninteresting personality, who had won deservedly by his work a foremost\r\nplace among the most influential national leaders of the party. His\r\nopinion carried great weight, and, though he spoke seldom, his mind\r\nmoved rapidly by a very simple and direct path to correct\r\nconclusions.[521]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 520: \"Many of New York's delegates were eminent men of\r\nbusiness, anxious for peace; others were adroit politicians, adept at\r\na trade and eager to hold the party together by any means.\"--James F.\r\nRhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. 2, p. 474.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 521: \"Though destitute of all literary furnishment, Richmond\r\ncarried on his broad shoulders one of the clearest heads in the ranks\r\nof the Barnburners.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 183.]\r\n\r\nAround Richmond were clustered August Belmont and Augustus Schell of\r\nNew York City, Peter Cagger and Erastus Corning of Albany, David L.\r\nSeymour of Troy, Sanford E. Church of Albion, and a dozen others quite\r\nas well known. Perhaps none of them equalled the powerful Richardson\r\nof Illinois, who led the Douglas forces, or his brilliant lieutenant,\r\nCharles E. Stuart of Michigan, whose directions and suggestions on the\r\nfloor of the convention, guided by an unerring knowledge of\r\nparliamentary law, were regarded with something of dread even by Caleb\r\nCushing, the gifted president of the convention; but John Cochrane of\r\nNew York City, who had attended Democratic state and national\r\nconventions for a quarter of a century, was quite able to represent\r\nthe Empire State to its advantage on the floor or elsewhere. He was a\r\nman of a high order of ability, and an accomplished and forceful\r\npublic speaker, whose sonorous voice, imposing manner, and skilful\r\ntactics made him at home in a parliamentary fight. \"Cochrane is a\r\nlarge but not a big man,\" said a correspondent of the day, \"full in\r\nthe region of the vest, and wears his beard, which is coarse and\r\nsandy, trimmed short. His head is bald, and his countenance bold, and\r\nthere are assurances in his complexion that he is a generous liver. He\r\nis a fair type of the fast man of intellect and culture, whose\r\nambition is to figure in politics. He is in Congress and can command\r\nthe ear of the House at any time. His great trouble is his Free-soil\r\nrecord. He took Free-soilism like a distemper and mounted the Buffalo\r\nplatform. He is well over it now, however, with the exception of a\r\nsingle heresy--the homestead law. He is for giving homesteads to the\r\nactual settlers upon the public land.\"[522]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 522: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 20.]\r\n\r\nDouglas had a majority of the delegates in the Charleston convention.\r\nBut, with the aid of California and Oregon, the South had seventeen of\r\nthe thirty-three States. This gave it a majority of the committee on\r\nresolutions, and, after five anxious days of protracted and earnest\r\ndebate, that committee reported a platform declaring it the duty of\r\nthe federal government to protect slavery in the territories, and\r\ndenying the power of a territory either to abolish slavery or to\r\ndestroy the rights of property in slaves by any legislation whatever.\r\nThe minority reaffirmed the Cincinnati platform of 1856, with the\r\nfollowing preamble and resolution: \"Inasmuch as differences of opinion\r\nexist in the Democratic party as to the nature and extent of the\r\npowers of a territorial legislature, and as to the powers and duties\r\nof Congress over the institution of slavery within the territories;\r\nResolved, that the Democratic party will abide by the decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court on the questions of constitutional law.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quickly evident that the disagreement which had plunged the\r\ncommittee into trouble extended to the convention. The debate became\r\nhot and bitter. In a speech of remarkable power, William L. Yancey of\r\nAlabama upbraided the Northern delegates for truckling to the\r\nFree-soil spirit. \"You acknowledged,\" he said, \"that slavery did not\r\nexist by the law of nature or by the law of God--that it only existed\r\nby state law; that it was wrong, but that you were not to blame. That\r\nwas your position, and it was wrong. If you had taken the position\r\ndirectly that slavery was right ... you would have triumphed. But you\r\nhave gone down before the enemy so that they have put their foot upon\r\nyour neck; you will go lower and lower still, unless you change front\r\nand change your tactics. When I was a schoolboy in the Northern\r\nStates, abolitionists were pelted with rotten eggs. But now this band\r\nof abolitionists has spread and grown into three bands--the black\r\nRepublican, the Free-soilers, and squatter sovereignty men--all\r\nrepresenting the common sentiment that slavery is wrong.\"[523] Against\r\nthis extreme Southern demand that Northern Democrats declare slavery\r\nright and its extension legitimate, Senator Pugh of Ohio vigorously\r\nprotested. \"Gentlemen of the South,\" he thundered, \"you mistake\r\nus--you mistake us! we will not do it.\"[524]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 523: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 524: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 50.]\r\n\r\nThe admission of the Softs and the adoption of a rule allowing\r\nindividual delegates from uninstructed States to vote as they pleased\r\nhad given the Douglas men an assured majority, and on the seventh day,\r\nwhen the substitution of the minority for the majority report by a\r\nvote of 165 to 138 threatened to culminate in the South's withdrawal,\r\nthe Douglas leaders permitted a division of their report into its\r\nsubstantive propositions. Under this arrangement, the Cincinnati\r\nplatform was reaffirmed by a vote of 237-1/2 to 65. The danger point\r\nhad now been reached, and Edward Driggs of Brooklyn, scenting the\r\nbrewing mischief, moved to table the balance of the report. Driggs\r\nfavoured Douglas, but, in common with his delegation, he favoured a\r\nunited party more, and could his motion have been carried at that\r\nmoment with a show of unanimity, the subsequent secession might have\r\nbeen checked if not wholly avoided. The Douglas leaders, however, not\r\nyet sufficiently alarmed, thought the withdrawal of two or three\r\nSouthern States might aid rather than hinder the nomination of their\r\nchief, and on this theory Driggs' motion was tabled. But, when\r\nAlabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi withdrew their votes, and nearly\r\nthe entire South refused to express an opinion on the popular\r\nsovereignty plank, the extent of the secession suddenly flashed upon\r\nRichardson, who endeavoured to speak in the din of the wildest\r\nexcitement. Richardson had withdrawn Douglas' name at the Cincinnati\r\nconvention in 1856; and, thinking some way out of their present\r\ntrouble might now be suggested by him, John Cochrane, in a voice as\r\nmusical as it was far-reaching, urged the convention to hear one whom\r\nhe believed brought another \"peace offering;\" but objection was made,\r\nand the roll call continued. Richardson's purpose, however, had not\r\nescaped the vigilant New Yorkers, who now retired for consultation.\r\nThe question was, should they strike out the only resolution having\r\nthe slightest significance in the minority report? By the time they\r\nhad decided in the affirmative, and returned to the hall, the whole\r\nDouglas army was in full retreat, willing, finally, to stand solely\r\nupon the reaffirmation of the Cincinnati platform, where the Driggs\r\nmotion would have landed them two hours earlier.\r\n\r\nBut the Douglas leaders were not yet satisfied. Writhing under their\r\nforced surrender, Stuart of Michigan took the floor, and by an\r\ninflammatory speech of the most offensive type started the stampede\r\nwhich the surrender of the Douglas platform was intended to avoid.\r\nAlabama led off, followed by Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina,\r\nFlorida, Texas, and Arkansas. Glenn of Mississippi, pale with emotion,\r\nspoke the sentiments of the seceders. \"Our going,\" he said, \"is not\r\nconceived in passion or carried out from mere caprice or\r\ndisappointment. It is the firm resolve of the great body we represent.\r\nThe people of Mississippi ask, what is the construction of the\r\nplatform of 1856? You of the North say it means one thing; we of the\r\nSouth another. They ask which is right and which is wrong? The North\r\nhave maintained their position, but, while doing so, they have not\r\nacknowledged the rights of the South. We say, go your way and we will\r\ngo ours. But the South leaves not like Hagar, driven into the\r\nwilderness, friendless and alone, for in sixty days you will find a\r\nunited South standing shoulder to shoulder.\"[525]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 525: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 66.]\r\n\r\nThis declaration, spoken with piercing emphasis, was received with the\r\nmost enthusiastic applause that had thus far marked the proceedings of\r\nthe convention. \"The South Carolinians cheered long and loud,\" says an\r\neye-witness, \"and the tempest of shouts made the circuit of the\r\ngalleries and the floor several times before it subsided. A large\r\nnumber of ladies favoured the secessionists with their sweetest smiles\r\nand with an occasional clapping of hands.\"[526]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 526: _Ibid._, p. 68.]\r\n\r\nAll this was telling hard upon the New York delegation.[527] It wanted\r\nharmony more than Douglas. Dickinson aspired to bring Southern friends\r\nto his support,[528] while Dean Richmond was believed secretly to\r\nindulge the hope that ultimately Horatio Seymour might be nominated;\r\nand, under the plausible and patriotic guise of harmonising the party,\r\nthe delegation had laboured hard to secure a compromise. It was shown\r\nthat Douglas need not be nominated; that with the South present he\r\ncould not receive a two-thirds majority; that with another candidate\r\nthe Southern States would continue in control. It was known that a\r\nmajority of the delegation stood ready even to vote for a conciliatory\r\nresolution, a mild slave code plank, declaring that all citizens of\r\nthe United States have an equal right to settle, with their property,\r\nin the territories, and that under the Supreme Court's decisions\r\nneither rights of person nor property could be destroyed or impaired\r\nby congressional or territorial legislation. This was Richmond's last\r\ncard. In playing it he took desperate chances, but he was tired of the\r\nstrain of maintaining the leadership of one faction, and of avoiding a\r\ntotal disruption with the other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 527: \"There was a Fourth of July feeling in Charleston that\r\nnight--a jubilee. The public sentiment was overwhelmingly and\r\nenthusiastically in favour of the seceders. The Douglas men looked\r\nbadly, as though they had been troubled with bad dreams. The\r\ndisruption is too serious for them. They find themselves in the\r\nposition of a semi-Free Soil sectional party, and the poor fellows\r\ntake it hard. The ultra South sectionalists accuse them of cleaving\r\nunto heresies as bad as Sewardism.\"--M. Halstead, _National Political\r\nConventions of 1860_, p. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 528: \"Dickinson has ten votes in the New York delegation and\r\nno more.\"--New York _Tribune's_ report from Charleston, April 24,\r\n1860.]\r\n\r\nTo the Southern extremists, marshalled by Mason and Slidell, the\r\nplatform was of secondary importance. They wanted to destroy Guthrie,\r\na personal enemy of Slidell, as well as to defeat Douglas, and,\r\nalthough it was apparent that the latter could not secure a two-thirds\r\nmajority, it was no less evident that the Douglas vote could nominate\r\nGuthrie. To break up this combination, therefore, the ultras saw no\r\nway open except to break up the convention on the question of a\r\nplatform. This phase of the case left Richmond absolutely helpless.\r\nThe secession of the cotton States might weaken Douglas, but it could\r\nin nowise aid the chances of a compromise candidate, since the latter,\r\nif nominated, must rely upon a large portion of the Douglas vote.\r\n\r\nBut Dean Richmond did not lose sight of his ultimate purpose. The\r\nsecession left the convention with 253 out of 304 votes; and a motion\r\nrequiring a candidate to obtain two-thirds of the original number\r\nbecame a test of devotion to Douglas, who hoped to get two-thirds of\r\nthe remaining votes, but who could not, under any circumstances,\r\nreceive two-thirds of the original number. As New York's vote was now\r\ndecisive, it put the responsibility directly upon Richmond. It was his\r\nopportunity to help or to break Douglas. The claim that precedent\r\nrequired two-thirds of the electoral vote to nominate was rejected by\r\nStuart as not having the sanction of logic. \"Two-thirds of the vote\r\ngiven in this convention\" was the language of the rule, he argued, and\r\nit could not mean two-thirds of all the votes originally in the\r\nconvention. Cushing admitted that a rigid construction of the rule\r\nseemed to refer to the votes cast on the ballot in this convention,\r\nbut \"the chair is not of the opinion,\" he said, \"that the words of the\r\nrule apply to the votes cast for the candidate, but to two-thirds of\r\nall the votes to be cast by the convention.\" This ruling in nowise\r\ninfluenced the solid delegations of Douglas' devoted followers from\r\nOhio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota; and\r\nif Richmond had been as loyal in his support, it was reasoned, New\r\nYork would have followed the Northwestern States. But Cushing's ruling\r\nafforded Richmond a technical peg upon which to hang a reason for not\r\ndeliberately and decisively cutting off the Empire State from the\r\npossibilities of a presidential nomination, and, apparently without\r\nany scruples whatever, he decided that the nominee must receive the\r\nequivalent of two-thirds of the electoral college.[529] After that\r\nvote one can no more think of Richmond or the majority of his\r\ndelegation as inspired with devoted loyalty to Douglas. One delegate\r\ndeclared that it sounded like clods falling upon the Little Giant's\r\ncoffin.[530]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 529: \"The drill of the New York delegation and its united\r\nvote created a murmur of applause at its steady and commanding\r\nfront.\"--New York _Tribune_, June 19, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 530: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 85.]\r\n\r\nLittle enthusiasm developed over the naming of candidates. Six were\r\nplaced in nomination--Douglas of Illinois, Guthrie of Kentucky, Hunter\r\nof Virginia, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, Lane of Oregon, and\r\nDickinson of New York. George W. Patrick of California named\r\nDickinson, and on the first ballot he received two votes from\r\nPennsylvania, one from Virginia, and four from California, while New\r\nYork cast its thirty-five votes for Douglas with as much éclat as if\r\nit had not just made his nomination absolutely impossible.[531] The\r\nresult gave Douglas 145-1/2 to 107-1/2 for all others, with 202\r\nnecessary to a choice. On the thirty-third ballot, Douglas, amidst\r\nsome enthusiasm, reached 152-1/2 votes, equivalent to a majority of\r\nthe electoral college; but, as the balloting proceeded, it became\r\nmanifest that this was his limit, and on the ninth day motions to\r\nadjourn to New York or Baltimore in June became frequent. The\r\nfifty-seventh ballot, the last of the session, gave Douglas 151-1/2,\r\nGuthrie 65-1/2, Dickinson 4, and all others 31. Dickinson had\r\nflickered between half a vote and sixteen, with an average of five.\r\nNever perhaps in the history of political conventions did an ambitious\r\ncandidate keep so far from the goal of success.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 531: \"After the vote of New York had decided that it was\r\nimpossible to nominate Douglas, it proceeded, the roll of States being\r\ncalled, to vote for him as demurely as if it meant it.\"--M. Halstead,\r\n_National Political Conventions of 1860_, p. 84.]\r\n\r\nIt was now apparent that the convention could not longer survive. The\r\nlistless delegates, the absence of enthusiasm, and the uncrowded\r\ngalleries, showed that all hope of a nomination was abandoned,\r\nespecially since the friends of Douglas, who could prevent the\r\nselection of another, declared that the Illinoisan would not withdraw\r\nunder any contingency. It is dreary reading, the record of the last\r\nthree days. If any further evidence were needed to show the utter\r\ncollapse of the dwindling, discouraged convention, the dejected,\r\ndespairing appearance of Richardson, until now supported by a bright\r\nheroism and cheery good humour, would have furnished it. Accordingly,\r\non the tenth day of the session, it was agreed to reassemble at\r\nBaltimore on Monday, June 18. Meantime the seceders had formed\r\nthemselves into a convention, adopted the platform recently reported\r\nby the majority, and adjourned to meet at Richmond on the same day.\r\n\r\nBitter thoughts filled the home-going delegates. Douglas' Northwestern\r\nfriends talked rancorously of the South; while, in their bitterness,\r\nYancey and his followers exulted in the defeat of the Illinois\r\nSenator. \"Men will be cutting one another's throats in a little\r\nwhile,\" said Alexander H. Stephens. \"In less than twelve months we\r\nshall be in war, and that the bloodiest in history. Men seem to be\r\nutterly blinded to the future.\"[532]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 532: James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n2, p. 453.]\r\n\r\n\"Do you not think matters may be adjusted at Baltimore?\" asked R.M.\r\nJohnston. \"Not the slightest chance of it,\" was the reply. \"The party\r\nis split forever. Douglas will not retire from the stand he has taken.\r\nThe only hope was at Charleston. If the party would be satisfied with\r\nthe Cincinnati platform and would cordially nominate Douglas, we\r\nshould carry the election; but I repeat to you that is impossible.\"[533]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 533: _Ibid._, p. 455.]\r\n\r\nBetween the conventions the controversy moved to the floor of the\r\nUnited States Senate. \"We claim protection for slavery in the\r\nterritories,\" said Jefferson Davis, \"first, because it is our right;\r\nsecondly, because it is the duty of the general government.\"[534] In\r\nreplying to Davis several days later, Douglas said: \"My name never\r\nwould have been presented at Charleston except for the attempt to\r\nproscribe me as a heretic, too unsound to be the chairman of a\r\ncommittee in this body, where I have held a seat for so many years\r\nwithout a suspicion resting on my political fidelity. I was forced to\r\nallow my name to go there in self-defence; and I will now say that had\r\nany gentleman, friend or foe, received a majority of that convention\r\nover me the lightning would have carried a message withdrawing my\r\nname.\"[535]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 534: _Ibid._, p. 453.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 535: James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n2, p. 455.]\r\n\r\nA few days afterward Davis referred to the matter again. \"I have a\r\ndeclining respect for platforms,\" he said. \"I would sooner have an\r\nhonest man on any sort of a rickety platform you could construct than\r\nto have a man I did not trust on the best platform which could be\r\nmade.\" This stung Douglas. \"If the platform is not a matter of much\r\nconsequence,\" he demanded, \"why press that question to the disruption\r\nof the party? Why did you not tell us in the beginning of this debate\r\nthat the whole fight was against the man and not upon the\r\nplatform?\"[536]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 536: _Ibid._, p. 456.]\r\n\r\nThese personalities served to deepen the exasperation of the sections.\r\nThe real strain was to come, and there was great need that cool heads\r\nand impersonal argument should prevail over misrepresentation and\r\npassion. But the coming event threw its shadow before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nSEWARD DEFEATED AT CHICAGO\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Republican national convention met at Chicago on May 16. It was\r\nthe prototype of the modern convention. In 1856, an ordinary hall in\r\nPhiladelphia, with a seating capacity of two thousand, sufficed to\r\naccommodate delegates and spectators, but in 1860 the large building,\r\ncalled a \"wigwam,\" specially erected for the occasion and capable of\r\nholding ten thousand, could not receive one-half the people seeking\r\nadmission, while marching clubs, bands of music, and spacious\r\nheadquarters for state delegations, marked the new order of things. As\r\nusual in later years, New York made an imposing demonstration. The\r\nfriends of Seward took an entire hotel, and an organised, well-drilled\r\nbody of men from New York City, under the lead of Tom Hyer, a noted\r\npugilist, headed by a gaily uniformed band, paraded the streets amidst\r\nadmiring crowds. For the first time, too, office-seekers were present\r\nin force at a Republican convention; and, to show their devotion, they\r\npacked hotel corridors and the convention hall itself with bodies of\r\nmen who vociferously cheered every mention of their candidate's name.\r\nSuch tactics are well understood and expected nowadays, but in 1860\r\nthey were unique.\r\n\r\nThe convention, consisting of 466 delegates, represented one southern,\r\nfive border, and eighteen free States. \"As long as conventions shall\r\nbe held,\" wrote Horace Greeley, \"I believe no abler, wiser, more\r\nunselfish body of delegates will ever be assembled than that which met\r\nat Chicago.\"[537] Governor Morgan, as chairman of the Republican\r\nnational committee, called the convention to order, presenting David\r\nWilmot, author of the famous proviso, for temporary chairman. George\r\nAshmun of Massachusetts, the favourite friend of Webster, became\r\npermanent president. The platform, adopted by a unanimous vote on the\r\nsecond day, denounced the Harper's Ferry invasion \"as among the\r\ngravest of crimes;\" declared the doctrine of popular sovereignty \"a\r\ndeception and fraud;\" condemned the attempt of President Buchanan to\r\nforce the Lecompton Constitution upon Kansas; denied \"the authority of\r\nCongress, of a territorial legislature, or of an individual to give\r\nlegal existence to slavery in any territory;\" demanded a liberal\r\nhomestead law; and favoured a tariff \"to encourage the development of\r\nthe industrial interests of the whole country.\" The significant\r\nsilence as to personal liberty bills, the Dred Scott decision, the\r\nfugitive slave law, and the abolition of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia, evidenced the handiwork of practical men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 537: New York _Tribune_, June 2, 1860.]\r\n\r\nOnly one incident disclosed the enthusiasm of delegates for the\r\ndoctrine which affirms the equality and defines the rights of man.\r\nJoshua E. Giddings sought to incorporate the sentiment that \"all men\r\nare created free and equal,\" but the convention declined to accept it\r\nuntil the eloquence of George William Curtis carried it amidst\r\ndeafening applause. It was not an easy triumph. Party leaders had\r\npreserved the platform from radical utterances; and, with one\r\ndisapproving yell, the convention tabled the Giddings amendment.\r\nInstantly Curtis renewed the motion; and when it drowned his voice, he\r\nstood with folded arms and waited. At last, the chairman's gavel gave\r\nhim another chance. In the calm, his musical voice, in tones that\r\npenetrated and thrilled, begged the representatives of the party of\r\nfreedom \"to think well before, upon the free prairies of the West, in\r\nthe summer of 1860, you dare to shrink from repeating the words of the\r\ngreat men of 1776.\"[538] The audience, stirred by an unwonted emotion,\r\napplauded the sentiment, and then adopted the amendment with a shout\r\nmore unanimous than had been the vote of disapproval.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 538: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 137.]\r\n\r\nThe selection of a candidate for President occupied the third day.\r\nFriends of Seward who thronged the city exhibited absolute\r\nconfidence.[539] They represented not only the discipline of the\r\nmachine, with its well-drilled cohorts, called the \"irrepressibles,\"\r\nand its impressive marching clubs, gay with banners and badges, but\r\nthe ablest leaders on the floor of the convention. And back of all,\r\nstood Thurlow Weed, the matchless manager, whose adroitness and wisdom\r\nhad been crowned with success for a whole generation. \"He is one of\r\nthe most remarkable men of our time,\" wrote Samuel Bowles, in the\r\npreceding February. \"He is cool, calculating, a man of expedients, who\r\nboasts that for thirty years he had not in political affairs let his\r\nheart outweigh his judgment.\" Governor Edwin D. Morgan and Henry J.\r\nRaymond were his lieutenants, William M. Evarts, his floor manager,\r\nand a score of men whose names were soon to become famous acted as his\r\nassistants. The brilliant rhetoric of George William Curtis, when\r\ninsisting upon an indorsement of the Declaration of Independence, gave\r\nthe opposition a taste of their mettle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 539: \"Mr. Seward seemed to be certain of receiving the\r\nnomination at Chicago. He felt that it belonged to him. His flatterers\r\nhad encouraged him in the error that he was the sole creator of the\r\nRepublican party.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 214. \"I\r\nhear of so many fickle and timid friends as almost to make me sorry\r\nthat I have ever attempted to organise a party to save my country.\"\r\nLetter of W.H. Seward to his wife, May 2, 1860.--F.W. Seward, _Life of\r\nW.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 448.]\r\n\r\nSeward, confident of the nomination, had sailed for Europe in May,\r\n1859, in a happy frame of mind. The only serious opposition had come\r\nfrom the _Tribune_ and from the Keystone State; but on the eve of his\r\ndeparture Simon Cameron assured him of Pennsylvania, and Greeley,\r\napparently reconciled, had dined with him at the Astor House. \"The sky\r\nis bright, and the waters are calm,\" was the farewell to his\r\nwife.[540] After his return there came an occasional shadow. \"I hear\r\nof so many fickle and timid friends,\" he wrote;[541] yet he had\r\nconfidence in Greeley, who, while calling with Weed, exhibited such\r\nfriendly interest that Seward afterward resented the suggestion of his\r\ndisloyalty.[542] On reaching Auburn to await the action of the\r\nconvention, his confidence of success found expression in the belief\r\nthat he would not again return to Congress during that session. As the\r\nwork of the convention progressed his friends became more sanguine.\r\nThe solid delegations of New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota,\r\nCalifornia, and Kansas, supplemented by the expected votes of New\r\nEngland and other States on a second roll call, made the nomination\r\ncertain. Edward Bates had Missouri, Delaware, and Oregon, but their\r\nvotes barely equalled one-half of New York's; Lincoln was positively\r\nsure of only Illinois, and several of its delegates preferred Seward;\r\nChase had failed to secure the united support of Ohio, and Dayton in\r\nNew Jersey was without hope. Cameron held Pennsylvania in reversion\r\nfor the New York Senator. So hopeless did the success of the\r\nopposition appear at midnight of the second day, that Greeley\r\ntelegraphed the _Tribune_ predicting Seward's nomination, and the\r\n\"irrepressibles\" anticipated victory in three hundred bottles of\r\nchampagne. As late as the morning of the third day, the confidence of\r\nthe Seward managers impelled them to ask whom the opposition preferred\r\nfor Vice President.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 540: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 360.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 541: _Ibid._, p. 448.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 542: \"Mr. Julius Wood of Columbus, O., an old and true\r\nfriend of Mr. Weed, met Mr. Seward in Washington, and reiterated his\r\nfears in connection with the accumulation of candidates. 'Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas brought to New York to divide your strength,' he said. But Mr.\r\nSeward was not disconcerted by these warnings. Less than a fortnight\r\nafterwards Mr. Wood was at the Astor House, where he again met Mr.\r\nWeed and Mr. Seward. Sunday afternoon Mr. Greeley visited the hotel\r\nand passing through one of the corridors met Mr. Wood, with whom he\r\nbegan conversation. 'We shan't nominate Seward,' said Mr. Greeley,\r\n'we'll take some more conservative man, like Pitt Fessenden or Bates.'\r\nImmediately afterwards Mr. Wood went to Mr. Seward's room. 'Greeley\r\nhas just been here with Weed,' said Mr. Seward. 'Weed brought him up\r\nhere. You were wrong in what you said to me at Washington about\r\nGreeley; he is all right.' 'No, I was not wrong,' insisted Mr. Wood.\r\n'Greeley is cheating you. He will go to Chicago and work against you.'\r\nAt this Mr. Seward smiled. 'My dear Wood,' said he, 'your zeal\r\nsometimes gets a little the better of your judgment.'\"--Thurlow Weed\r\nBarnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 269.]\r\n\r\nBut opponents had been industriously at work. They found that\r\nRepublicans of Know-Nothing antecedents, especially in Pennsylvania,\r\nstill disliked Seward's opposition to their Order, and that\r\nconservative Republicans recoiled from his doctrine of the higher law\r\nand the irrepressible conflict. Upon this broad foundation of unrest,\r\nthe opposition adroitly builded, poisoning the minds of unsettled\r\ndelegates with stories of his political methods and too close\r\nassociation with Thurlow Weed. No one questioned Seward's personal\r\nintegrity; but the distrust of the political boss existed then as much\r\nas now, and his methods were no less objectionable. \"The\r\nmisconstruction put on his phrase 'the irrepressible conflict between\r\nfreedom and slavery' has, I think, damaged him a good deal,\" wrote\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant, \"and in this city there is one thing which has\r\ndamaged him still more. I mean the project of Thurlow Weed to give\r\ncharters for a set of city railways, for which those who receive them\r\nare to furnish a fund of from four to six hundred thousand dollars, to\r\nbe expended for the Republican cause in the next presidential\r\nelection.\"[543] Such a scheme would be rebuked even in this day of\r\ntrust and corporation giving. People resented the transfer to\r\nWashington of the peculiar state of things at Albany, and when James\r\nS. Pike wrote of Seward's close connection with men who schemed for\r\npublic grants, it recalled his belief in the adage that \"Money makes\r\nthe mare go.\" Allusion to Seward's \"bad associates,\" as Bryant called\r\nthem, and to the connection between \"Seward stock\" and \"New York\r\nstreet railroads\" had become frequent in the correspondence of leading\r\nmen, and now, when delegates could talk face to face in the\r\nconfidence of the party council chamber, these accusations made a\r\nprofound impression. The presence of Tom Hyer and his rough marchers\r\ndid not tend to eliminate these moral objections. \"If you do not\r\nnominate Seward, where will you get your money?\" was their stock\r\nargument.[544]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 543: Parke Godwin, _Life of William Cullen Bryant_, Vol. 2,\r\np. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 544: Horace Greeley, New York _Tribune_, May 22, 1860.]\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley, sitting as a delegate from Oregon, stayed with the\r\nfriends of Bates and Lincoln at the Tremont Hotel. The announcement\r\nstartled the New Yorkers. He had visited Weed at Albany on his way to\r\nChicago, leaving the impression that he would support Seward,[545] but\r\nonce in the convention city his disaffection became quickly known. Of\r\nall the members of the convention none attracted more attention, or\r\nhad greater influence with the New England and Western delegates. His\r\npeculiar head and dress quickly identified him as he passed through\r\nthe hotel corridors from delegation to delegation, and whenever he\r\nstopped to speak, an eager crowd of listeners heard his reasons why\r\nSeward could not carry the doubtful States. He marshalled all the\r\nfacts and forgot no accusing rumour. His remarkable letter of 1854,\r\ndissolving the firm of Weed, Seward, and Greeley, had not then been\r\npublished, leaving him in the position of a patriot and prophet who\r\nopposed the Senator because he sincerely believed him a weak\r\ncandidate. \"If we have ever demurred to his nomination,\" he said in\r\nthe _Tribune_ of April 23, in reply to the _Times'_ charge of\r\nhostility, \"it has been on the ground of his too near approximation in\r\nprinciple and sentiment to our standard to be a safe candidate just\r\nyet. We joyfully believe that the country is acquiring a just and\r\nadequate conception of the malign influence exerted by the slave power\r\nupon its character, its reputation, its treatment of its neighbour,\r\nand all its great moral and material interests. In a few years more we\r\nbelieve it will be ready to elect as its President a man who not only\r\nsees but proclaims the whole truth in this respect--in short, such a\r\nman as Governor Seward. We have certainly doubted its being yet so far\r\nadvanced in its political education as to be ready to choose for\r\nPresident one who looks the slave oligarchy square in the eye and\r\nsays, 'Know me as your enemy.'\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 545: \"At this time there was friendly intercourse between\r\nMr. Greeley and Mr. Weed, nor did anybody suppose that Mr. Greeley was\r\nnot on good terms with Governor Seward. He had, indeed, in 1854,\r\nwritten to Mr. Seward a remarkable letter, 'dissolving the firm of\r\nSeward, Weed & Greeley,' but Mr. Weed had never seen such a letter,\r\nnor did Mr. Greeley appear to remember its existence. Mr. Weed and Mr.\r\nGreeley met frequently in New York, not with all of the old\r\ncordiality, perhaps, but still they had by no means quarrelled. Mr.\r\nGreeley wrote often to Mr. Weed, in the old way, and he and his family\r\nwere visitors at Mr. Weed's house. Indeed--though that seems\r\nimpossible--Mr. Greeley stopped at Mr. Weed's house, in Albany, on his\r\nway West, before the Chicago convention, and made a friendly visit of\r\na day or so, leaving the impression that he was going to support Mr.\r\nSeward when he reached Chicago.\"--Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of\r\nThurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 268.]\r\n\r\nGreeley favoured Bates of Missouri, but was ready to support anybody\r\nto beat Seward. Bryant, disliking what he called the \"pliant politics\"\r\nof the New York Senator, had been disposed to favour Chase until the\r\nCooper Institute speech. Lincoln left a similar trail of friends\r\nthrough New England. The Illinoisan's title of \"Honest Old Abe,\"\r\ngiven, him by his neighbours, contrasted favourably with the whispered\r\nreports of \"bad associates\" and the \"New York City railroad scheme.\"\r\nGradually, even the radical element in the unpledged delegations began\r\nquestioning the advisability of the New Yorker's selection, and when,\r\non the night preceding the nomination, Andrew Curtin of Pennsylvania\r\nand Henry S. Lane[546] of Indiana, candidates for governor in their\r\nrespective States, whose defeat in October would probably bring\r\ndefeat in November, declared that Seward's selection would cost them\r\ntheir election, the opposition occupied good vantage ground. David\r\nDavis, the Illinois manager for Lincoln, against the positive\r\ninstructions of his principal, strengthened these declarations by\r\npromising to locate Simon Cameron and Caleb B. Smith in the Cabinet.\r\nThe next morning, however, the anti-Seward forces entered the\r\nconvention without having concentrated upon a candidate. Lincoln had\r\nwon Indiana, but Pennsylvania and Ohio were divided; New Jersey stood\r\nfor Dayton; Bates still controlled Missouri, Delaware, and Oregon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 546: \"I was with my husband in Chicago, and may tell you\r\nnow, as most of the actors have joined the 'silent majority,' what no\r\nliving person knows, that Thurlow Weed, in his anxiety for the success\r\nof Seward, took Mr. Lane out one evening and pleaded with him to lead\r\nthe Indiana delegation over to Seward, saying they would send enough\r\nmoney from New York to insure his election for governor, and carry the\r\nState later for the New York candidate.\" Letter of Mrs. Henry S. Lane,\r\nSeptember 16, 1891.--Alex. K. McClure, _Lincoln and Men of War Times_,\r\np. 25, _note_.]\r\n\r\nWilliam M. Evarts presented Seward's name amidst loud applause. But at\r\nthe mention of Lincoln's the vigour of the cheers surprised the\r\ndelegates. The Illinois managers had cunningly filled the desirable\r\nseats with their shouters, excluding Tom Hyer and his marchers, who\r\narrived too late, so that, although the applause for Seward was\r\n\"frantic, shrill, and wild,\" says one correspondent, the cheers for\r\nLincoln were \"louder and more terrible.\"[547] Whether this had the\r\ninfluence ascribed to it at the time by Henry J. Raymond and others\r\nhas been seriously questioned, but it undoubtedly aided in fixing the\r\nwavering delegates, and in encouraging the friends of other candidates\r\nto rally about the Lincoln standard.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 547: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 145.]\r\n\r\nThe first roll call proved a disappointment to Seward. Though the\r\npledged States were in line, New England fell short, Pennsylvania\r\nshowed indifference, and Virginia created a profound surprise.\r\nNevertheless, the confidence of the Seward forces remained unshaken.\r\nOf the 465 votes, Seward had 173-1/2, Lincoln 102, Cameron 50-1/2,\r\nChase 49, and Bates 48, with 42 for seven others; necessary to a\r\nchoice, 233. On the second ballot Seward gained four votes from New\r\nJersey, two each from Texas and Kentucky, and one each from\r\nMassachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska--making a total of 184-1/2.\r\nLincoln moved up to 133. The action of Ohio in giving fourteen votes\r\nto Lincoln had been no less disappointing to the Seward managers than\r\nthe transfer of Vermont's vote to the same column; but, before they\r\ncould recover from this shock, Cameron was withdrawn and 48 votes from\r\nPennsylvania carried Lincoln's total to 181.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of this change brought the convention to its feet\r\namid scenes of wild excitement. Seward's forces endeavoured to avert\r\nthe danger, but the arguments of a week were bearing fruit. As the\r\nthird roll call proceeded, the scattering votes turned to Lincoln.\r\nSeward lost four from Rhode Island and half a vote from Pennsylvania,\r\ngiving him 180, Lincoln 231-1/2, Chase 24-1/2, Bates 22, and 7 for\r\nthree others. At this moment, an Ohio delegate authorised a change of\r\nfour votes from Chase to Lincoln, and instantly one hundred guns,\r\nfired from the top of an adjoining building, announced the nomination\r\nof \"Honest Old Abe.\" In a short speech of rare felicity and great\r\nstrength, William M. Evarts moved to make the nomination unanimous.\r\n\r\nThe New York delegation, stunned by the result, declined the honour of\r\nnaming a candidate for Vice President; and, on reassembling in the\r\nafternoon, the convention nominated Hannibal Hamlin of Maine. As\r\nEvarts was leaving the wigwam he remarked, with characteristic humour:\r\n\"Well, Curtis, at least we have saved the Declaration of\r\nIndependence!\"\r\n\r\nThree days after the nomination Greeley wrote James S. Pike:\r\n\"Massachusetts was right in Weed's hands, contrary to all reasonable\r\nexpectation. It was all we could do to hold Vermont by the most\r\ndesperate exertions; and I at some times despaired of it. The rest of\r\nNew England was pretty sound, but part of New Jersey was somehow\r\ninclined to sin against the light and knowledge. If you had seen the\r\nPennsylvania delegation, and known how much money Weed had in hand,\r\nyou would not have believed we could do so well as we did. Give Curtin\r\nthanks for that. Ohio looked very bad, yet turned out well, and\r\nVirginia had been regularly sold out; but the seller could not\r\ndeliver. We had to rain red-hot bolts on them, however, to keep the\r\nmajority from going for Seward, who got eight votes here as it was.\r\nIndiana was our right bower, and Missouri above praise. It was a\r\nfearful week, such as I hope and trust I shall never see\r\nrepeated.\"[548] That Greeley received credit for all he did is\r\nevidenced by a letter from John D. Defrees, then a leading politician\r\nof Indiana, addressed to Schuyler Colfax. \"Greeley slaughtered Seward\r\nand saved the party,\" he wrote. \"He deserves the praises of all men\r\nand gets them now. Wherever he goes he is greeted with cheers.\"[549]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 548: James S. Pike, _First Blows of the Civil War_, p. 519.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 549: Hollister, _Life of Colfax_, p. 148.]\r\n\r\nThe profound sorrow of Seward's friends resembled the distress of\r\nHenry Clay's supporters in 1840. It was not chagrin; it was not the\r\nselfish fear that considers the loss of office or spoils; it was not\r\ndiscouragement or despair. Apprehensions for the future of the party\r\nand the country there may have been, but their grief found its\r\nfountain-head in the feeling that \"his fidelity to the country, the\r\nConstitution and the laws,\" as Evarts put it; \"his fidelity to the\r\nparty, and the principle that the majority govern; his interest in the\r\nadvancement of our party to victory, that our country may rise to its\r\ntrue glory,\"[550] had led to his sacrifice solely for assumed\r\navailability. The belief obtained that a large majority of the\r\ndelegates preferred him, and that had the convention met elsewhere he\r\nwould probably have been successful. In his _Life of Lincoln_, Alex.\r\nK. McClure of Pennsylvania, an anti-Seward delegate, says that \"of the\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-one men who voted for Lincoln on the third and\r\nlast ballot, not less than one hundred of them voted reluctantly\r\nagainst the candidate of their choice.\"[551]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 550: William M. Evarts' speech making Lincoln's nomination\r\nunanimous. F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 451.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 551: Alex. K. McClure, _Life of Lincoln_, p. 171.]\r\n\r\nAt Auburn a funeral gloom settled upon the town.[552] Admiration for\r\nSeward's great ability, and a just pride in the exalted position he\r\noccupied in his party and before the country, had long ago displaced\r\nthe local spirit that refused him a seat in the constitutional\r\nconvention of 1846; and after the defeat his fellow townsmen could not\r\nbe comforted. Sincere sorrow filled their hearts. But Seward's bearing\r\nwas heroic. When told that no Republican could be found to write a\r\nparagraph for the evening paper announcing and approving the\r\nnominations, he quickly penned a dozen lines eulogistic of the\r\nconvention and its work. To Weed, who shed bitter tears, he wrote\r\nconsolingly. \"I wish I were sure that your sense of disappointment is\r\nas light as my own,\" he said. \"It ought to be equally so, if we have\r\nbeen equally thoughtful and zealous for friends, party, and country. I\r\nknow not what has been left undone that could have been done, or done\r\nthat ought to be regretted.\"[553] During the week many friends from\r\ndistant parts of the State called upon him, \"not to console,\" as they\r\nexpressed it, \"but to be consoled.\" His cheerful demeanour under a\r\ndisappointment so overwhelming to everybody else excited the inquiry\r\nhow he could exhibit such control. His reply was characteristic. \"For\r\ntwenty years,\" he said, \"I have been breasting a daily storm of\r\ncensure. Now, all the world seems disposed to speak kindly of me. In\r\nthat pile of papers, Republican and Democratic, you will find hardly\r\none unkind word. When I went to market this morning I confess I was\r\nunprepared for so much real grief as I heard expressed at every\r\ncorner.\"[554]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 552: \"On the day the convention was to ballot for a\r\ncandidate, Cayuga County poured itself into Auburn. The streets were\r\nfull, and Mr. Seward's house and grounds overflowed with his admirers.\r\nFlags were ready to be raised and a loaded cannon was placed at the\r\ngate whose pillars bore up two guardian lions. Arrangements had been\r\nperfected for the receipt of intelligence. At Mr. Seward's right hand,\r\njust within the porch, stood his trusty henchman, Christopher Morgan.\r\nThe rider of a galloping steed dashed through the crowd with a\r\ntelegram and handed it to Seward, who passed it to Morgan. For Seward,\r\nit read, 173-1/2; for Lincoln, 102. Morgan repeated it to the\r\nmultitude, who cheered vehemently. Then came the tidings of the second\r\nballot: For Seward, 184-1/2--for Lincoln, 181. 'I shall be nominated\r\non the next ballot,' said Seward, and the throng in the house\r\napplauded, and those on the lawn and in the street echoed the cheers.\r\nThe next messenger lashed his horse into a run. The telegram read,\r\n'Lincoln nominated. T.W.' Seward turned as pale as ashes. The sad\r\ntidings crept through the vast concourse. The flags were furled, the\r\ncannon was rolled away, and Cayuga County went home with a clouded\r\nbrow. Mr. Seward retired to rest at a late hour, and the night breeze\r\nin the tall trees sighed a requiem over the blighted hopes of New\r\nYork's eminent son.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, pp.\r\n215-16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 553: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 453.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 554: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 453.]\r\n\r\nBut deep in his heart despondency reigned supreme. \"The reappearance\r\nat Washington in the character of a leader deposed by his own party,\r\nin the hour of organisation for decisive battle, thank God is\r\npast--and so the last of the humiliations has been endured,\" he wrote\r\nhis wife. \"Preston King met me at the depot and conveyed me to my\r\nhome. It seemed sad and mournful. Dr. Nott's benevolent face, Lord\r\nNapier's complacent one, Jefferson's benignant one, and Lady Napier's\r\nloving one, seemed all like pictures of the dead. Even 'Napoleon at\r\nFontainebleau' seemed more frightfully desolate than ever. At the\r\nCapitol the scene was entirely changed from my entrance into the\r\nchamber last winter. Cameron greeted me kindly; Wilkinson of\r\nMinnesota, and Sumner cordially and manfully. Other Republican\r\nsenators came to me, but in a manner that showed a consciousness of\r\nembarrassment, which made the courtesy a conventional one; only Wilson\r\ncame half a dozen times, and sat down by me. Mason, Gwin, Davis, and\r\nmost of the Democrats, came to me with frank, open, sympathising\r\nwords, thus showing that their past prejudices had been buried in the\r\nvictory they had achieved over me. Good men came through the day to\r\nsee me, and also this morning. Their eyes fill with tears, and they\r\nbecome speechless as they speak of what they call 'ingratitude.' They\r\nconsole themselves with the vain hope of a day of 'vindication,' and\r\nmy letters all talk of the same thing. But they awaken no response in\r\nmy heart. I have not shrunk from any fiery trial prepared for me by\r\nthe enemies of my cause. But I shall not hold myself bound to try, a\r\nsecond time, the magnanimity of its friends.\"[555] To Weed he wrote:\r\n\"Private life, as soon as I can reach it without grieving or\r\nembarrassing my friends, will be welcome to me. It will come the 4th\r\nof next March in my case, and I am not unprepared.\"[556]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 555: _Ibid._, p. 454.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 556: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n270.]\r\n\r\nDefeat was a severe blow to Seward. For the moment he seemed well-nigh\r\nfriendless. The letter to his wife after he reached Washington was a\r\nthrenody. He was firmly convinced that he was a much injured man, and\r\nhis attitude was that of the martyr supported by the serenity of the\r\nsaint. But to the world he bore himself with the courage and the\r\ndignity that belong to one whose supremacy is due to superiority of\r\ntalents. The country could not know that he was to become a secretary\r\nof state of whom the civilised world would take notice; but one of\r\nSeward's prescience must have felt well satisfied in his own mind,\r\neven when telling Weed how \"welcome\" private life would be, that,\r\nalthough he was not to become President, he was at the opening of a\r\ngreater political career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nNEW YORK'S CONTROL AT BALTIMORE\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recess between the Charleston and Baltimore conventions did not\r\nallay hostilities. Jefferson Davis' criticism and Douglas' tart\r\nretorts transferred the quarrel to the floor of the United States\r\nSenate, and by the time the delegates had reassembled at Baltimore on\r\nJune 18, 1860, the factions exhibited greater exasperation than had\r\nbeen shown at Charleston. Yet the Douglas men seemed certain of\r\nsuccess. Dean Richmond, it was said, had been engaged in private\r\nconsultation with Douglas and his friends, pledging himself to stand\r\nby them to the last. On the other hand, rumours of a negotiation in\r\nwhich the Southerners and the Administration at Washington had offered\r\nthe New Yorkers their whole strength for any man the Empire State\r\nmight name other than Douglas and Guthrie, found ready belief among\r\nthe Northwestern delegates. It was surmised, too, that the defeat of\r\nSeward at Chicago had strengthened the chances of Horatio Seymour, on\r\nthe ground that the disappointed and discontented Seward Republicans\r\nwould allow him to carry the State. Whatever truth there may have been\r\nin these reports, all admitted that the New York delegation had in its\r\nhands the destiny of the convention, if not that of the party\r\nitself.[557]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 557: \"There was no question that the New York delegation had\r\nthe fate of the convention in its keeping; and while it was understood\r\nthat the strength of Douglas in the delegation had been increased\r\nduring the recess by the Fowler defalcation (Fowler's substitute being\r\nreported a Douglas man) and by the appearance of regular delegates\r\nwhose alternates had been against Douglas at Charleston, it was\r\nobvious that the action of the politicians of New York could not be\r\ncounted upon in any direction with confidence. Rumours circulated that\r\na negotiation had been carried on in Washington by the New Yorkers\r\nwith the South, to sell out Douglas, the Southerners and the\r\nAdministration offering their whole strength to any man New York might\r\nname, provided that State would slaughter Douglas. On the other hand,\r\nit appeared that Dean Richmond, the principal manager of the New\r\nYorkers, had pledged himself, as solemnly as a politician could do, to\r\nstand by the cause of Douglas to the last.\"--M. Halstead, _National\r\nPolitical Conventions of 1860_, p. 159.]\r\n\r\nThe apparent breaking point at Charleston was the adoption of a\r\nplatform; at Baltimore it was the readmission of seceding delegates.\r\nFlorida, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas presented their original\r\ndelegations, who sought immediate admission; but a resolution,\r\nintroduced by Sanford E. Church of New York, referred them to the\r\ncommittee on credentials, with the understanding that persons\r\naccepting seats were bound in honour to abide the action of the\r\nconvention. The Douglas men, greeting this resolution with tremendous\r\napplause, proposed driving it through without debate; but New York\r\nhesitated to order the previous question. Then it asked permission to\r\nwithdraw for consultation, and when it finally voted in the negative,\r\ndeeming it unwise to stifle debate, it revealed the fact that its\r\naction was decisive on all questions.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to the Church resolution proposed sending only contested\r\nseats to the credentials committee, without conditions as to loyalty,\r\nand over this joinder of issues some very remarkable speeches\r\ndisclosed malignant bitterness rather than choice rhetoric.\r\nRichardson, still the recognised spokesman of Douglas, received marked\r\nattention as he argued boldly that the amendment admitted delegates\r\nnot sent there, and decided a controversy without a hearing. \"I do not\r\npropose,\" he said, \"to sit side by side with delegates who do not\r\nrepresent the people; who are not bound by anything, when I am bound\r\nby everything. We are not so hard driven yet as to be compelled to\r\nelect delegates from States that do not choose to send any here.\"[558]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 558: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 167.]\r\n\r\nRussell of Virginia responded, declaring that his State intended, in\r\nthe interest of fair play, to cling to the Democracy of the South. \"If\r\nwe are to be constrained to silence,\" he vociferated, \"I beg gentlemen\r\nto consider the silence of Virginia ominous. If we are not\r\ngentlemen--if we are such knaves that we cannot trust one another--we\r\nhad better scatter at once, and cease to make any effort to bind each\r\nother.\"[559] Speaking on similar lines, Ewing of Tennessee asked what\r\nwas meant. \"Have you no enemy in front? Have you any States to spare?\r\nWe are pursued by a remorseless enemy, and yet from all quarters of\r\nthis convention come exclamations of bitterness and words that burn,\r\nwith a view to open the breach in our ranks wider and wider, until at\r\nlast, Curtius-like, we will be compelled to leap into it to close it\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 559: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 168.]\r\n\r\nBut it remained for Montgomery of Pennsylvania, in spite of Cochrane's\r\nconciliatory words, to raise the political atmosphere to the\r\ntemperature at Charleston just before the secession. \"For the first\r\ntime in the history of the Democratic party,\" he said, \"a number of\r\ndelegations of sovereign States, by a solemn instrument in writing,\r\nresigned their places upon the floor of the convention. They went out\r\nwith a protest, not against a candidate, but against the principles of\r\na party, declaring they did not hold and would not support them. And\r\nnot only that, but they called a hostile convention, and sat side by\r\nside with us, deliberating upon a candidate and the adoption of a\r\nplatform. Principles hostile to ours were asserted and a nomination\r\nhostile to ours was threatened. Our convention was compelled to\r\nadjourn in order to have these sovereign States represented. What\r\nbecame of the gentlemen who seceded? They adjourned to meet at\r\nRichmond. Now they seek to come back and sit upon this floor with us,\r\nand to-day they threaten us if we do not come to their terms. God\r\nknows I love the star spangled banner of my country, and it is because\r\nI love the Union that I am determined that any man who arrays himself\r\nin hostility to it shall not, with my consent, take a seat in this\r\nconvention. I am opposed to secession either from this Union or from\r\nthe Democratic convention, and when men declare the principles of the\r\nparty are not their principles, and that they will neither support\r\nthem nor stay in a convention that promulgates them, then I say it is\r\nhigh time, if they ask to come back, that they shall declare they have\r\nchanged their minds.\"[560]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 560: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\npp. 168-171.]\r\n\r\nThis swung the door of vituperative debate wide open, and after an\r\nadjournment had closed it in the hall, the crowds continued it in the\r\nstreet. At midnight, while Yancey made one of his silver-toned\r\nspeeches, which appears, by all accounts, to have been a piece of\r\ngenuine eloquence, the friends of Douglas, on the opposite side of\r\nMonument Square, kept the bands playing and crowds cheering.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention assembled on the second day, Church, in the\r\ninterest of harmony, withdrew the last clause of his resolution, and,\r\nwithout a dissenting voice, all contested seats went to the committee\r\non credentials. Then the convention impatiently waited three days for\r\na report, while the night meetings, growing noisier and more arrogant,\r\nserved to increase the bitterness. The Douglasites denounced their\r\nopponents as \"disorganisers and disunionists;\" the Southerners\r\nretorted by calling them \"a species of sneaking abolitionists.\" Yancey\r\nspoke of them as small men, with selfish aims. \"They are\r\nostrich-like--their head is in the sand of squatter sovereignty, and\r\nthey do not know their great, ugly, ragged abolition body is exposed.\"\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day, the committee presented two reports, the majority,\r\nwithout argument, admitting the contestants--the minority, in a\r\nremarkably strong document of singular skill and great clearness,\r\nseating the seceders on the ground that their withdrawal was not a\r\nresignation and was not so considered by the convention. A\r\nresignation, it argued, must be made to the appointing power. The\r\nwithdrawing delegates desired the instruction of their constituencies,\r\nwho authorised them in every case except South Carolina to repair to\r\nBaltimore and endeavour once more to unite their party and promote\r\nharmony and peace in the great cause of their country.\r\n\r\nThis report made a profound impression upon the convention, and the\r\nmotion to substitute it for the majority report at once threw New York\r\ninto confusion. That delegation had already decided to sustain the\r\nmajority, but the views of the seceders, so ably and logically\r\npresented, had reopened the door of debate, and a resolute minority,\r\ncombining more than a proportionate share of the talent and worth of\r\nthe delegation, insisted upon further time. After the convention had\r\ngrudgingly taken a recess to accommodate the New Yorkers, William H.\r\nLudlow reappeared and apologised for asking more time. This created\r\nthe impression that Richmond's delegation, at the last moment,\r\nproposed to slaughter Douglas[561] as it did at Charleston, and the\r\nlatter's friends, maddened and disheartened over what they called \"New\r\nYork's dishonest and cowardly procrastination,\" would gladly have\r\nprevented an adjournment. But the Empire State held the key to the\r\nsituation. Without it Douglas could get nothing and in a hopeless sort\r\nof way his backers granted Ludlow's request.[562]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 561: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 185.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 562: \"The _real_ business transacting behind the scenes has\r\nbeen the squelching of Douglas, which is understood to be as good as\r\nbargained for. The South is in due time to concentrate on a\r\ncandidate--probably Horatio Seymour of our own State--and then New\r\nYork is to desert Douglas for her own favourite son. Such is the\r\nprogramme as it stood up to last evening.\"--New York _Tribune_\r\n(editorial), June 20, 1860. \"There are plenty of rumours, but nothing\r\nhas really form and body unless it be a plan to have Virginia bring\r\nforward Horatio Seymour, whom New York will then diffidently accept in\r\nplace of Douglas.\"--_Ibid._ (telegraphic report).]\r\n\r\nThe situation of the New York delegation was undoubtedly most\r\nembarrassing. Their admission to the Charleston convention had\r\ndepended upon the Douglas vote, but their hope of success hinged upon\r\nharmony with the cotton States. A formidable minority favoured the\r\nreadmission of the seceders and the abandonment of Douglas regardless\r\nof their obligation. This was not the policy of Dean Richmond, who\r\nwas the pivotal personage. His plan included the union of the party\r\nby admitting the seceders, and the nomination of Horatio Seymour with\r\nthe consent of the Northwest, after rendering the selection of Douglas\r\nimpossible. It was a brilliant programme, but the inexorable demand of\r\nthe Douglas men presented a fatal drawback. Richmond implored and\r\npleaded. He knew the hostility of the Douglasites could make Seymour's\r\nnomination impossible, and he knew, also, that a refusal to admit the\r\nseceders would lead to a second secession, a second ticket, and a\r\nhopelessly divided party. Nevertheless, the Douglas men were\r\nremorseless.[563] Even Douglas' letter, sent Richardson on the third\r\nday, and his dispatch to Dean Richmond,[564] received on the fifth\r\nday, authorising the withdrawal of his name if it could be done\r\nwithout sacrificing the principle of non-intervention, did not relieve\r\nthe situation. Rule or ruin was now their motto, as much as it was the\r\nSouth's, and between them Richmond's diplomatic resistance,[565] which\r\nonce seemed of iron, became as clay. Nevertheless, Richmond's control\r\nof the New York delegation remained unbroken. The minority tried new\r\narguments, planned new combinations, and racked their brains for new\r\ndevices, but when Richmond finally gave up the hopeless and thankless\r\ntask of harmonising the Douglasites and seceders, a vote of 27 to 43\r\nforced the minority of the delegation into submission by the screw of\r\nthe Syracuse unit rule, and New York finally sustained the majority\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 563: \"The Soft leaders still shiver on the brink of a\r\ndecision. But a new light broke on them yesterday, when they\r\ndiscovered that, if they killed Douglas, his friends were able and\r\nresolved to kill Seymour in turn.\"--New York _Tribune_ (editorial),\r\nJune 21. \"The action of New York is still a subject of great doubt and\r\nanxiety. As it goes so goes the party and the Union of course.\"--_Ibid._\r\n(telegraphic report).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 564: \"A dispatch from Douglas to Richmond was sent because a\r\nletter containing similar suggestions to Richardson had been kept in\r\nthe latter's pocket. But Richmond suppressed the dispatch as\r\nRichardson had suppressed the letter.\"--M. Halstead, _National\r\nPolitical Conventions of 1860_, p. 195. \"Richardson afterward\r\nexplained that the action of the Southerners had put it out of his\r\npower to use Douglas' letter.\"--James F. Rhodes, _History of the\r\nUnited States_, Vol. 2, p. 415.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 565: \"It was asserted in Baltimore and believed in political\r\ncircles that New York offered to reconsider her vote on the Louisiana\r\ncase, and make up the convention out of the original materials, with\r\nthe exception of the Alabama delegation. It could not agree to admit\r\nYancey & Co. But the seceders and their friends would not hear to any\r\nsuch proposition. They scorned all compromise.\"--M. Halstead,\r\n_National Political Conventions of 1860_, p. 195. \"Many were the\r\nexpedients devised to bring about harmony; but it was to attempt the\r\nimpossible. The Southerners were exacting, the delegates from the\r\nNorthwest bold and defiant.\"--James F. Rhodes, _History of the United\r\nStates_, Vol. 2, p. 474.]\r\n\r\nAfter this, the convention became the theatre of a dramatic event\r\nwhich made it, for the moment, the centre of interest to the political\r\nworld. The majority report seated the Douglas faction from Alabama and\r\nLouisiana, and then excluded William L. Yancey, a representative\r\nseceder, and let in Pierre Soulé, a representative Douglasite. It is\r\nsufficient proof of the sensitiveness of the relations between the two\r\nfactions that an expressed preference for one of these men should\r\nagain disrupt the convention, but the moving cause was far deeper than\r\nthe majority's action. Yancey belonged to the daring, resolute, and\r\nunscrupulous band of men who, under the unhappy conditions that\r\nthreatened their defeat, had already decided upon disunion; and, when\r\nthe convention repudiated him, the lesser lights played their part.\r\nVirginia led a new secession, followed by most of the delegates from\r\nNorth Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Maryland, and\r\nfinally by Caleb Cushing himself, the astute presiding officer, whose\r\naction anticipated the withdrawal of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone, Pierre Soulé took the floor and made the speech\r\nof the convention, fascinating all who saw and heard. An eye-witness\r\nspeaks of his rolling, glittering, eagle eye, Napoleonic head and\r\nface, sharp voice with a margin of French accent, and piercing,\r\nintense earnestness of manner. \"I have not been at all discouraged,\"\r\nhe said, \"by the emotion which has been attempted to be created in\r\nthis body by those who have seceded from it. We from the furthest\r\nSouth were prepared; we had heard the rumours which were to be\r\ninitiatory of the exit which you have witnessed on this day, and we\r\nknew that conspiracy, which had been brooding for months past, would\r\nbreak out on this occasion, and for the purposes which are obvious to\r\nevery member. Sirs, there are in political life men who were once\r\nhonoured by popular favour, who consider that the favour has become to\r\nthem an inalienable property, and who cling to it as to something that\r\ncan no longer be wrested from their hands--political fossils so much\r\nincrusted in office that there is hardly any power that can extract\r\nthem. They saw that the popular voice was already manifesting to this\r\nglorious nation who was to be her next ruler. Instead of bringing a\r\ncandidate to oppose him; instead of creating issues upon which the\r\nchoice of the nation could be enlightened; instead of principles\r\ndiscussed, what have we seen? An unrelenting war against the\r\nindividual presumed to be the favourite of the nation! a war waged by\r\nan army of unprincipled and unscrupulous politicians, leagued with a\r\npower which could not be exerted on their side without disgracing\r\nitself and disgracing the nation.\" Secession, he declared, meant\r\ndisunion, \"but the people of the South will not respond to the call of\r\nthe secessionists.\"[566]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 566: M. Halstead, _National Political Conventions of 1860_,\r\np. 207.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of Soulé's speech greatly animated and reassured the\r\nfriends of Douglas, who now received 173-1/2 of the 190-1/2 votes\r\ncast. Dickinson got half a vote from Virginia, and Horatio Seymour one\r\nvote from Pennsylvania. At the mention of the latter's name, David P.\r\nBissell of Utica promptly withdrew it upon the authority of a letter,\r\nin which Seymour briefly but positively declared that under no\r\ncircumstances could he be a candidate for President or Vice President.\r\nOn the second ballot, Douglas received all the votes but thirteen.\r\nThis was not two-thirds of the original vote, but, in spite of the\r\nresolution which Dean Richmond passed at Charleston, Douglas was\r\ndeclared, amidst great enthusiasm, the nominee of the convention,\r\nsince two-thirds of the delegates present had voted for him. Benjamin\r\nFitzpatrick, United States senator from Alabama, was then nominated\r\nfor Vice President. When he afterwards declined, the national\r\ncommittee appointed Herschel V. Johnson of Georgia in his place.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Baltimore seceders, joined by their seceding colleagues\r\nfrom Charleston, met elsewhere in the city, adopted the Richmond\r\nplatform, and nominated John C. Breckenridge of Kentucky for\r\nPresident, and Joseph Lane of Oregon for Vice President. A few days\r\nlater the Richmond convention indorsed these nominations.\r\n\r\nAfter the return of the New York delegation, the gagged minority,\r\nthrough the lips of Daniel S. Dickinson, told the story of the\r\nmajority's purpose at Charleston and Baltimore. Dickinson was not\r\ndepressed or abashed by his failure; neither was he a man to be rudely\r\nsnuffed out or bottled up; and, although his speech at the Cooper\r\nInstitute mass-meeting, called to ratify the Breckenridge and Lane\r\nticket, revealed a vision clouded with passion and prejudice, it\r\nclearly disclosed the minority's estimate of the cardinal object of\r\nDean Richmond's majority. \"Waiving all questions of the merits or\r\ndemerits of Mr. Douglas as a candidate,\" he said, his silken white\r\nhair bringing into greater prominence the lines of a handsome face,\r\n\"his pretensions were pressed upon the convention in a tone and\r\ntemper, and with a dogged and obstinate persistence, which was well\r\ncalculated, if it was not intended, to break up the convention, or\r\nforce it into obedience to the behests of a combination. The authors\r\nof this outrage, who are justly and directly chargeable with it, were\r\nthe ruling majority of the New York delegation. They held the balance\r\nof power, and madly and selfishly and corruptly used it for the\r\ndisruption of the Democratic party in endeavouring to force it to\r\nsubserve their infamous schemes. They were charged with high\r\nresponsibilities in a crisis of unusual interest in our history, and\r\nin an evil moment their leprous hands held the destinies of a noble\r\nparty. They proclaimed personally and through their accredited organs\r\nthat the Southern States were entitled to name a candidate, but from\r\nthe moment they entered the convention at Charleston until it was\r\nfinally broken up at Baltimore by their base conduct and worse faith,\r\ntheir every act was to oppose any candidate who would be acceptable to\r\nthose States.\r\n\r\n\"Those who controlled the New York delegation through the fraudulent\r\nprocess of a unit vote--a rule forced upon a large minority to stifle\r\ntheir sentiments--will hereafter be known as political gamblers. The\r\nDemocratic party of New York, founded in the spirit of Jefferson, has,\r\nin the hands of these gamblers, been disgraced by practices which\r\nwould dishonour a Peter Funk cast-off clothing resort; cheating the\r\npeople of the State, cheating a great and confiding party, cheating\r\nthe convention which admitted them to seats, cheating delegations who\r\ntrusted them, cheating everybody with whom they came in contact, and\r\nthen lamenting from day to day, through their accredited organ, that\r\nthe convention had not remained together so that they might finally\r\nhave cheated Douglas. Political gamblers! You have perpetrated your\r\nlast cheat--consummated your last fraud upon the Democratic party.\r\nHenceforth you will be held and treated as political outlaws. There is\r\nno fox so crafty but his hide finally goes to the hatter.\"[567]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 567: New York _Tribune_, July 19, 1860.]\r\n\r\nIn his political controversies, Dickinson acted on the principle that\r\nan opponent is necessarily a blockhead or a scoundrel. But there was\r\nlittle or no truth in his severe arraignment. Richmond's purpose was\r\nplainly to nominate Horatio Seymour if it could be done with the\r\nconsent of the Northwestern States, and his sudden affection for a\r\ntwo-thirds rule came from a determination to prolong the convention\r\nuntil it yielded consent. At no time did he intend leaving Douglas for\r\nany one other than Seymour. On the other hand, Dickinson had always\r\nfavoured slavery.[568] Neither the Wilmot Proviso nor the repeal of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise disturbed him. What slavery demanded he\r\ngranted; what freedom sought he denounced. His belief that the South\r\nwould support him for a compromise candidate in return for his\r\nfidelity became an hallucination. It showed itself at Cincinnati in\r\n1852 when he antagonised Marcy; and his position in 1860 was even less\r\nadvantageous. Nevertheless, Dickinson nursed his delusion until the\r\nguns at Fort Sumter disclosed the real design of Yancey and the men in\r\nwhom he had confided.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 568: \"The obduracy, the consistency of Mr. Dickinson's\r\nDemocracy are of the most marked type. Ever since he changed his vote\r\nfrom Van Buren to Polk, with such hearty alacrity in the Baltimore\r\nconvention of 1844, he has promptly yielded to every requisition which\r\nthe Southern Democracy has made upon their Northern allies. All along\r\nthrough the stormy years when the star of the Wilmot Proviso was in\r\nthe ascendant, and when Wright and Dix bowed to the gale, and even\r\nMarcy and Bronson bent before it, Dickinson, on the floor of the\r\nSenate, stood erect and immovable.\"--New York _Tribune_, July 4,\r\n1860.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nRAYMOND, GREELEY, AND WEED\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that the defeat of Seward at Chicago, so unexpected,\r\nand so far-reaching in its effect, should be encountered without some\r\nattempt to fix the responsibility. To Thurlow Weed's sorrow[569] was\r\nadded the mortification of defeat. He had staked everything upon\r\nsuccess, and, although he doubtless wished to avoid any unseemly\r\ndemonstration of disappointment, the rankling wound goaded him into a\r\ndesire to relieve himself of any lack of precaution. Henry J. Raymond\r\nscarcely divided the responsibility of management; but his newspaper,\r\nwhich had spoken for Seward, shared in the loss of prestige, while the\r\n_Tribune_, his great rival in metropolitan journalism, disclosed\r\nbetween the lines of assumed modesty an exultant attitude.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 569: \"Mr. Weed was for a time completely unnerved by the\r\nresult. He even shed tears over the defeat of his old friend.\"--Thurlow\r\nWeed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 271.\r\n\r\n\"After the joy of Lincoln's nomination had subsided,\" wrote Leonard\r\nSwett of Chicago, \"Judge Davis and I called upon Mr. Weed. This was\r\nthe first time either of us had met him. He did not talk angrily as to\r\nthe result, nor did he complain of any one. Confessing with much\r\nfeeling to the great disappointment of his life, he said, 'I hoped to\r\nmake my friend, Mr. Seward, President, and I thought I could serve my\r\ncountry in so doing.' He was a larger man intellectually than I\r\nanticipated, and of finer fibre. There was in him an element of\r\ngentleness and a large humanity which won me, and I was pleased no\r\nless than surprised.\"--_Ibid._, Vol. 2, p. 292.]\r\n\r\nGreeley had played a very important part in the historic convention.\r\nThe press gave him full credit for his activity, and he admitted it\r\nin his jubilant letter to Pike; but after returning to New York he\r\nseemed to think it wise to minimise his influence, claiming that the\r\nresult would have been the same had he remained at home. \"The fact\r\nthat the four conspicuous doubtful States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nIndiana, and Illinois,\" he wrote, \"unanimously testified that they\r\ncould not be carried for Seward was decisive. Against this Malakoff\r\nthe most brilliant evolutions of political strategy could not\r\navail.\"[570] This two-column article, modestly concealing his own\r\nwork, might not have led to an editorial war between the three great\r\nRepublican editors of the State, had not Greeley, in the exordium of a\r\nspeech, published in the _Tribune_ of May 23, exceeded the limits of\r\nhuman endurance. \"The past is dead,\" he said. \"Let the dead past bury\r\nit, and let the mourners, if they will, go about the streets.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 570: New York _Tribune_, May 22, 1860.]\r\n\r\nThe exultant sentences exasperated Raymond, who held the opinion which\r\ngenerally obtained among New York Republican leaders, that Greeley's\r\npersistent hostility was not only responsible for Seward's defeat, but\r\nthat under the guise of loyalty to the party's highest interests he\r\nhad been insidious and revengeful, and Raymond believed it needed only\r\na bold and loud-spoken accusation against him to fill the mind of the\r\npublic with his guilt. In this spirit he wrote a stinging reply. \"With\r\nthe generosity which belongs to his nature, and which a feeling not\r\nunlike remorse may have stimulated into unwonted activity,\" said this\r\nAmerican Junius, \"Mr. Greeley awards to others the credit which\r\nbelongs transcendently to himself. The main work of the Chicago\r\nconvention was the defeat of Governor Seward, and in that endeavour\r\nMr. Greeley laboured harder, and did tenfold more, than the whole\r\nfamily of Blairs, together with all the gubernatorial candidates, to\r\nwhom he modestly hands over the honours of the effective campaign. Mr.\r\nGreeley had special qualifications, as well as a special love, for\r\nthis task. For twenty years he had been sustaining the political\r\nprinciples and vindicating the political conduct of Mr. Seward\r\nthrough the columns of the most influential political newspaper in the\r\ncountry. His voice was potential precisely where Governor Seward was\r\nstrongest, because it was supposed to be that of a friend, strong in\r\nhis personal attachment and devotion, and driven into opposition on\r\nthis occasion solely by the despairing conviction that the welfare of\r\nthe country and the triumph of the Republican cause demanded the\r\nsacrifice. For more than six months Mr. Greeley had been preparing the\r\nway for this consummation. He was in Chicago several days before the\r\nmeeting of the convention and he devoted every hour of the interval to\r\nthe most steady and relentless prosecution of the main business which\r\ntook him thither.\r\n\r\n\"While it was known to some that nearly six years ago he had\r\nprivately, but distinctly, repudiated all further political friendship\r\nfor and alliance with Governor Seward, for the avowed reason that\r\nGovernor Seward had never aided or advised his elevation to office, no\r\nuse was made of this knowledge in quarters where it would have\r\ndisarmed the deadly effect of his pretended friendship for the man\r\nupon whom he was thus deliberately wreaking the long hoarded revenge\r\nof a disappointed office-seeker.... Being thus stimulated by a hatred\r\nhe had secretly cherished for years, protected by the forbearance of\r\nthose whom he assailed, and strong in the confidence of those upon\r\nwhom he sought to operate, it is not strange that Mr. Greeley's\r\nefforts should have been crowned with success. But it is perfectly\r\nsafe to say that no other man--certainly no one occupying a position\r\nless favourable for such an assault--could possibly have accomplished\r\nthat result.\"[571]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 571: New York _Times_, May 25, 1860.]\r\n\r\nRaymond's letter produced a profound impression. It excited the\r\nastonishment and incredulity of every one. He had made a distinct\r\ncharge that Greeley's opposition was the revenge of a disappointed\r\noffice-seeker, and the public, resenting the imputation, demanded the\r\nevidence. Greeley himself echoed the prayer by a blast from his silver\r\ntrumpet which added to the interest as well as to the excitement.\r\n\"This carefully drawn indictment,\" he said, \"contains a very artful\r\nmixture of truth and misrepresentation. No intelligent reader of the\r\n_Tribune_ has for months been left in doubt of the fact that I deemed\r\nthe nomination of Governor Seward for President at this time unwise\r\nand unsafe; and none can fail to understand that I did my best at\r\nChicago to prevent that nomination. My account of 'Last Week at\r\nChicago' is explicit on that point. True, I do not believe my\r\ninfluence was so controlling as the defeated are disposed to represent\r\nit, but this is not material to the issue. It is agreed that I did\r\nwhat I could.\r\n\r\n\"It is not true--it is grossly untrue--that at Chicago I commended\r\nmyself to the confidence of delegates 'by professions of regard and\r\nthe most zealous friendship for Governor Seward, but presented defeat,\r\n_even in New York_, as the inevitable result of his nomination.' The\r\nvery reverse of this is the truth. I made no professions before the\r\nnomination, as I have uttered no lamentations since. It was the simple\r\nduty of each delegate to do just whatever was best for the Republican\r\ncause, regardless of personal considerations. And this is exactly what\r\nI did.... As to New York, I think I was at least a hundred times asked\r\nwhether Governor Seward could carry this State;[572] and I am sure I\r\nuniformly responded affirmatively, urging delegates to consider the\r\nNew York delegation the highest authority on that point as I was\r\nstrenuously urging that the delegations from Pennsylvania, New\r\nJersey, Indiana, and Illinois must be regarded as authority as to who\r\ncould and who could not carry their respective States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 572: \"At Chicago, Seward encountered the opposition from his\r\nown State of such powerful leaders as Greeley, Dudley Field, Bryant,\r\nand Wadsworth. The first two were on the ground and very busy. The two\r\nlatter sent pungent letters that were circulated among the delegates\r\nfrom the various States. The main point of the attack was that Seward\r\ncould not carry New York. Soon after the adjournment of the\r\nconvention, William Curtis Noyes, a delegate, told me that a careful\r\ncanvass of the New York delegation showed that nearly one-fourth of\r\nits members believed it was extremely doubtful if Seward could obtain\r\na majority at the polls in that State.\"--H.B. Stanton, _Random\r\nRecollections_, pp. 214-15. \"Perhaps the main stumbling block over\r\nwhich he fell in the convention was Thurlow Weed.\"--_Ibid._, p. 215.]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Raymond proceeds to state that I had, 'in November, 1854,\r\nprivately but distinctly repudiated all further political friendship\r\nfor and alliance with Governor Seward, and menaced him with hostility\r\nwherever it could be made most effective; for the avowed reason that\r\nGovernor Seward had never advised my elevation to office,' &c. This is\r\na very grave charge, and, being dated 'Auburn, Tuesday, May 22, 1860,'\r\nand written by one who was there expressly and avowedly to console\r\nwith Governor Seward on his defeat and denounce me as its author, it\r\nis impossible not to see that Governor Seward is its responsible\r\nsource. I, therefore, call on him for the private letter which I did\r\nwrite him in November, 1854, that I may print it verbatim in the\r\n_Tribune_, and let every reader judge how far it sustains the charges\r\nwhich his mouthpiece bases thereon. I maintain that it does not\r\nsustain them; but I have no copy of the letter, and I cannot discuss\r\nits contents while it remains in the hands of my adversaries, to be\r\nused at their discretion. I leave to others all judgment as to the\r\nunauthorised use which has already been made of this private and\r\nconfidential letter, only remarking that this is by no means the first\r\ntime it has been employed to like purpose. I have heard of its\r\ncontents being dispensed to members of Congress from Governor Seward's\r\ndinner-table; I have seen articles based on it paraded in the columns\r\nof such devoted champions of Governor Seward's principles and aims as\r\nthe Boston _Courier_. It is fit that the New York _Times_ should\r\nfollow in their footsteps; but I, who am thus fired on from an ambush,\r\ndemand that the letter shall no longer be thus employed. Let me have\r\nthe letter and it shall appear verbatim in every edition of the\r\n_Tribune_. Meantime, I only say that, when I fully decided that I\r\nwould no longer be devoted to Governor Seward's personal fortunes, it\r\nseemed due to candour and fair dealing that I should privately but in\r\nall frankness apprise him of the fact. It was not possible that I\r\ncould in any way be profited by writing that letter; I well understood\r\nthat it involved an abdication of all hopes of political advancement;\r\nyet it seemed due to my own character that the letter should be\r\nwritten. Of course I never dreamed that it could be published, or used\r\nas it already has been; but no matter--let us have the letter in\r\nprint, and let the public judge between its writer and his open and\r\ncovert assailants. At all events I ask no favour and fear no open\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\n\"There are those who will at all events believe that my opposition to\r\nGovernor Seward's nomination was impelled by personal considerations;\r\nand among these I should expect to find the Hon. Henry J. Raymond.\r\nWith these I have no time for controversy; in their eyes I desire no\r\nvindication. But there is another and far larger class who will\r\nrealise that the obstacles to Governor Seward's election were in no\r\ndegree of my creation, and that their removal was utterly beyond my\r\npowers. The whole course of the _Tribune_ has tended to facilitate the\r\nelevation to the Presidency of a statesman cherishing the pronounced\r\nanti-slavery views of Governor Seward; it is only on questions of\r\nfinance and public economy that there has been any perceptible\r\ndivergence between us. Those anti-democratic voters of Pennsylvania,\r\nNew Jersey, Indiana, and Illinois, who could not be induced to vote\r\nfor Governor Seward, have derived their notions of him in some measure\r\nfrom the _Times_, but in no measure from the _Tribune_. The\r\ndelegations from those States, with the candidates for governor in\r\nPennsylvania and Indiana, whose representations and remonstrances\r\nrendered the nomination of Governor Seward, in the eyes of all\r\nintelligent, impartial observers, a clear act of political suicide,\r\nwere nowise instructed or impelled by me. They acted on views\r\ndeliberately formed long before they came to Chicago. It is not my\r\npart to vindicate them; but whoever says they were influenced by me,\r\nother than I was by them, does them the grossest injustice.\r\n\r\n\"I wished first of all to succeed; next, to strengthen and establish\r\nour struggling brethren in the border slave States. If it had seemed\r\nto me possible to obtain one more vote in the doubtful States for\r\nGovernor Seward than for any one else, I should have struggled for him\r\nas ardently as I did against him, even though I had known that the\r\nRaymonds who hang about our party were to be his trusted counsellors\r\nand I inflexibly shut out from his confidence and favour. If there be\r\nany who do not believe this, I neither desire their friendship nor\r\ndeprecate their hostility.\"[573]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 573: New York _Tribune_, June 2, 1860.]\r\n\r\nGreeley's demand for his letter did not meet with swift response. It\r\nwas made on June 2. When Seward passed through New York on his way to\r\nWashington on the 8th, a friend of Greeley waited upon him, but he had\r\nnothing for the _Tribune_. Days multiplied into a week, and still\r\nnothing came. Finally, on June 13, Greeley received it through the\r\nhands of Thurlow Weed and published it on the 14th. It bore date \"New\r\nYork, Saturday evening, November 11, 1854,\" and was addressed simply\r\nto \"Governor Seward.\" Its great length consigned it to nonpareil in\r\nstrange contrast to the long primer type of the editorial page, but\r\nits publication became the sensation of the hour. To this day its fine\r\nthought-shading is regarded the best illustration of Greeley's\r\nmatchless prose.\r\n\r\n\"The election is over,\" he says, \"and its results sufficiently\r\nascertained. It seems to me a fitting time to announce to you the\r\ndissolution of the political firm of Seward, Weed & Greeley, by the\r\nwithdrawal of the junior partner--said withdrawal to take effect on\r\nthe morning after the first Tuesday in February next. And, as it may\r\nseem a great presumption in me to assume that any such firm exists,\r\nespecially since the public was advised, rather more than a year ago,\r\nby an editorial rescript in the _Evening Journal_, formally reading me\r\nout of the Whig party, that I was esteemed no longer either useful or\r\nornamental in the concern, you will, I am sure, indulge me in some\r\nreminiscences which seem to befit the occasion.\r\n\r\n\"I was a poor young printer and editor of a literary journal--a very\r\nactive and bitter Whig in a small way, but not seeking to be known out\r\nof my own ward committee--when, after the great political revulsion of\r\n1837, I was one day called to the City Hotel, where two strangers\r\nintroduced themselves as Thurlow Weed and Lewis Benedict, of Albany.\r\nThey told me that a cheap campaign paper of a peculiar stamp at Albany\r\nhad been resolved on, and that I had been selected to edit it. The\r\nannouncement might well be deemed flattering by one who had never even\r\nsought the notice of the great, and who was not known as a partisan\r\nwriter, and I eagerly embraced their proposals. They asked me to fix\r\nmy salary for the year; I named $1,000, which they agreed to; and I\r\ndid the work required to the best of my ability. It was work that made\r\nno figure and created no sensation; but I loved it and did it well.\r\nWhen it was done you were Governor, dispensing offices worth $3000 to\r\n$20,000 per year to your friends and compatriots, and I returned to my\r\ngarret and my crust, and my desperate battle with pecuniary\r\nobligations heaped upon me by bad partners in business and the\r\ndisastrous events of 1837. I believe it did not then occur to me that\r\nsome of these abundant places might have been offered to me without\r\ninjustice; I now think it should have occurred to you. If it did occur\r\nto me, I was not the man to ask you for it; I think that should not\r\nhave been necessary. I only remember that no friend at Albany inquired\r\nas to my pecuniary circumstances; that your friend (but not mine),\r\nRobert C. Wetmore, was one of the chief dispensers of your patronage\r\nhere; and that such devoted compatriots as A.H. Wells and John Hooks\r\nwere lifted by you out of pauperism into independence, as I am glad I\r\nwas not; and yet an inquiry from you as to my needs and means at that\r\ntime would have been timely, and held ever in grateful remembrance.\r\n\r\n\"In the Harrison campaign of 1840 I was again designated to edit a\r\ncampaign paper. I published it as well, and ought to have made\r\nsomething by it, in spite of its extremely low price; my extreme\r\npoverty was the main reason why I did not. It compelled me to hire\r\npresswork, mailing, etc., done by the job, and high charges for extra\r\nwork nearly ate me up. At the close I was still without property and\r\nin debt, but this paper had rather improved my position.\r\n\r\n\"Now came the great scramble of the swell mob of coon minstrels and\r\ncider suckers at Washington--I not being counted in. Several regiments\r\nof them went on from this city; but no one of the whole crowd--though\r\nI say it who should not--had done so much toward General Harrison's\r\nnomination and election as yours respectfully. I asked nothing,\r\nexpected nothing; _but you_, Governor Seward, _ought to have asked\r\nthat I be postmaster of New York_. Your asking would have been in\r\nvain; but it would have been an act of grace neither wasted nor\r\nundeserved.\r\n\r\n\"I soon after started the _Tribune_, because I was urged to do so by\r\ncertain of your friends, and because such a paper was needed here. I\r\nwas promised certain pecuniary aid in so doing; it might have been\r\ngiven me without cost or risk to any one. All I ever had was a loan by\r\npiecemeal of $1000, from James Coggeshall. God bless his honoured\r\nmemory! I did not ask for this, and I think it is the one sole case in\r\nwhich I ever received a pecuniary favour from a political associate. I\r\nam very thankful that he did not die till it was fully repaid.\r\n\r\n\"And let me here honour one grateful recollection. When the Whig party\r\nunder your rule had offices to give, my name was never thought of; but\r\nwhen in '42-'43, we were hopelessly out of power, I was honoured with\r\nthe nomination for state printer. When we came again to have a state\r\nprinter to elect, as well as nominate, the place went to Weed, as it\r\nought. Yet it was worth something to know that there was once a time\r\nwhen it was not deemed too great a sacrifice to recognise me as\r\nbelonging to your household. If a new office had not since been\r\ncreated on purpose to give its valuable patronage to H.J. Raymond and\r\nenable St. John to show forth his _Times_ as the organ of the Whig\r\nstate administration, I should have been still more grateful.\r\n\r\n\"In 1848 your star again rose, and my warmest hopes were realised in\r\nyour election to the Senate. I was no longer needy, and had no more\r\nclaim than desire to be recognised by General Taylor. I think I had\r\nsome claim to forbearance from you. What I received thereupon was a\r\nmost humiliating lecture in the shape of a decision in the libel case\r\nof Redfield and Pringle, and an obligation to publish it in my own and\r\nthe other journal of our supposed firm. I thought and still think this\r\nlecture needlessly cruel and mortifying. The plaintiffs, after using\r\nmy columns to the extent of their needs or desires, stopped writing\r\nand called on me for the name of their assailant. I proffered it to\r\nthem--a thoroughly responsible man. They refused to accept it unless\r\nit should prove to be one of the four or five first men in\r\nBatavia!--when they had known from the first who it was, and that it\r\nwas neither of them. They would not accept that which they had\r\ndemanded; they sued me instead for money, and money you were at\r\nliberty to give them to their heart's content. I do not think you\r\n_were_ at liberty to humiliate me in the eyes of my own and your\r\npublic as you did. I think you exalted your own judicial sternness and\r\nfearlessness unduly at my expense. I think you had a better occasion\r\nfor the display of these qualities when Webb threw himself entirely\r\nupon you for a pardon which he had done all a man could do to demerit.\r\nHis paper is paying you for it now.\r\n\r\n\"I have publicly set forth my view of your and our duty with respect\r\nto fusion, Nebraska, and party designations. I will not repeat any of\r\nthat. I have referred also to Weed's reading me out of the Whig\r\nparty--my crime being, in this as in some other things, that of doing\r\nto-day what more politic persons will not be ready to do till\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"Let me speak of the late canvass. I was once sent to Congress for\r\nninety days merely to enable Jim Brooks to secure a seat therein for\r\nfour years. _I think I never hinted to any human being that I would\r\nhave liked to be put forward for any place._ But James W. White (you\r\nhardly know how good and true a man he is) started my name for\r\nCongress, and Brooks' packed delegation thought I could help him\r\nthrough; so I was put on behind him. But this last spring, after the\r\nNebraska question had created a new state of things at the North, one\r\nor two personal friends, of no political consideration, suggested my\r\nname as a candidate for governor, and I did not discourage them. Soon,\r\nthe persons who were afterward mainly instrumental in nominating Clark\r\ncame about me, and asked if I could secure the Know-Nothing vote. I\r\ntold them I neither could nor would touch it; on the contrary, I\r\nloathed and repelled it. Thereupon they turned upon Clark.\r\n\r\n\"I said nothing, did nothing. A hundred people asked me who should be\r\nrun for governor. I sometimes indicated Patterson; I never hinted at\r\nmy own name. But by and by Weed came down, and called me to him, to\r\ntell me why he could not support me for governor. I had never asked\r\nnor counted on his support.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure Weed did not mean to humiliate me; but he did it. The\r\nupshot of his discourse (very cautiously stated) was this: If I were a\r\ncandidate for governor, I should beat not myself only, but you.\r\nPerhaps that was true. But as I had in no manner solicited his or your\r\nsupport, I thought this might have been said to my friends rather than\r\nto me. I suspect it is true that I could not have been elected\r\ngovernor as a Whig. But had he and you been favourable, there would\r\nhave been a party in the State ere this which could and would have\r\nelected me to _any_ post, without injuring itself or endangering your\r\nre-election.\r\n\r\n\"It was in vain that I urged that I had in no manner asked a\r\nnomination. At length I was nettled by his language--well intended,\r\nbut _very_ cutting as addressed by him to me--to say, in substance,\r\n'Well, then, make Patterson governor, and try my name for lieutenant.\r\nTo lose this place is a matter of no importance; and we can see\r\nwhether I am really so odious.'\r\n\r\n\"I should have hated to serve as lieutenant-governor, but I should\r\nhave gloried in running for the post. I want to have my enemies all\r\nupon me at once; am tired of fighting them piecemeal. And, though I\r\nshould have been beaten in the canvass, I know that my running would\r\nhave helped the ticket, and helped my paper.\r\n\r\n\"It was thought best to let the matter take another course. No other\r\nname could have been put on the ticket so bitterly humbling to me as\r\nthat which was selected. The nomination was given to Raymond; the\r\nfight left to me. And, Governor Seward, _I have made it_, though it be\r\nconceited in me to say so. Even Weed has not been (I speak of his\r\npaper) hearty in this contest, while the journal of the Whig\r\nlieutenant-governor has taken care of its own interests and let the\r\ncanvass take care of itself, as it early declared it would do. That\r\njournal has (because of its milk-and-water course) some twenty\r\nthousand subscribers in this city and its suburbs, and of these twenty\r\nthousand, I venture to say more voted for Ullman and Scroggs than for\r\nClark and Raymond; the _Tribune_ (also because of its character) has\r\nbut eight thousand subscribers within the same radius, and I venture\r\nto say that of its habitual readers, nine-tenths voted for Clark and\r\nRaymond--very few for Ullman and Scroggs. I had to bear the brunt of\r\nthe contest....\r\n\r\n\"Governor Seward, I know that some of your most cherished friends\r\nthink me a great obstacle to your advancement; that John Schoolcraft,\r\nfor one, insists that you and Weed should not be identified with me. I\r\ntrust, after a time, you will not be. I trust I shall never be found\r\nin opposition to you; I have no further wish than to glide out of the\r\nnewspaper world as quietly and as speedily as possible, join my family\r\nin Europe, and, if possible, stay there quite a time--long enough to\r\ncool my fevered brain and renovate my over-tasked energies. All I ask\r\nis that we shall be counted even on the morning after the first\r\nTuesday in February, as aforesaid, and that I may thereafter take such\r\ncourse as seems best without reference to the past.\r\n\r\n\"You have done me acts of valued kindness in the line of your\r\nprofession; let me close with the assurance that these will ever be\r\ngratefully remembered by Yours, Horace Greeley.\"[574]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 574: New York _Tribune_, June 14, 1860.]\r\n\r\nAt the time Seward received this letter he regarded it as only a\r\npassing cloud-shadow. \"To-day I have a long letter from Greeley, full\r\nof sharp, pricking thorns,\" he wrote Weed. \"I judge, as we might\r\nindeed well know from his nobleness of disposition, that he has no\r\nidea of saying or doing anything wrong or unkind; but it is sad to see\r\nhim so unhappy. Will there be a vacancy in the Board of Regents this\r\nwinter? Could one be made at the close of the session? Could he have\r\nit? Raymond's nomination and election is hard for him to bear.\"[575]\r\nTwo or three weeks later, after a call at the _Tribune_ office, Seward\r\nagain wrote Weed, suggesting that \"Greeley's despondency is\r\noverwhelming, and seems to be aggravated by the loss of subscribers.\r\nBut below this is chagrin at the failure to obtain official\r\nposition.\"[576] With such inquiries and comments Seward put the famous\r\nletter away.[577]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 575: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 239.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 576: _Ibid._, p. 240.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 577: \"My personal relations with Governor Seward were wholly\r\nunchanged by this letter. We met frequently and cordially after it was\r\nwritten, and we very freely conferred and co-operated during the long\r\nstruggle in Congress for Kansas and Free Labour. He understood as well\r\nas I did that my position with regard to him, though more independent\r\nthan it had been, was nowise hostile, and that I was as ready to\r\nsupport his advancement as that of any other statesman, whenever my\r\njudgment should tell me that the public good required it. I was not\r\nhis adversary, but my own and my country's freeman.\"--Horace Greeley,\r\n_Recollections of a Busy Life_, p. 321.]\r\n\r\nIts publication did not accomplish all that Raymond expected. People\r\nwere amazed, and deep in their hearts many persons felt that Greeley\r\nhad been treated unfairly. The inquiry as to a vacancy in the Board of\r\nRegents showed that Seward himself shared this opinion at the time.\r\nBut the question that most interested the public in 1860 was, why, if\r\nGreeley had declared war upon Seward in 1854, did not Weed make it\r\nknown in time to destroy the influence of the man who had\r\n\"deliberately wreaked the long-hoarded revenge of a disappointed\r\noffice-seeker?\" This question reflected upon Weed's management of\r\nSeward's campaign, and to avoid the criticism he claimed to have been\r\n\"in blissful ignorance of its contents.\" This seems almost impossible.\r\nBut in explaining the groundlessness of Greeley's complaints, Weed\r\nwrote an editorial, the dignity and patriotism of which contrasted\r\nfavourably with Greeley's self-seeking.\r\n\r\n\"There are some things in this letter,\" wrote the editor of the\r\n_Evening Journal_, \"requiring explanation--all things in it, indeed,\r\nare susceptible of explanations consistent with Governor Seward's full\r\nappreciation of Mr. Greeley's friendship and services. The letter was\r\nevidently written under a morbid state of feeling, and it is less a\r\nmatter of surprise that such a letter was thus written, than that its\r\nwriter should not only cherish the ill-will that prompted it for six\r\nyears, but allow it to influence his action upon a question which\r\nconcerns his party and his country.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Greeley's first complaint is that this journal, in an 'editorial\r\nrescript formally read him out of the Whig party.' Now, here is the\r\n'editorial rescript formally reading' Mr. Greeley out of the Whig\r\nparty, taken from the _Evening Journal_ of September 6, 1853:\r\n\r\n     \"'The _Tribune_ defines its position in reference to the\r\n     approaching election. Regarding the \"Maine law\" as a\r\n     question of paramount importance, it will support members of\r\n     the legislature friendly to its passage, irrespective of\r\n     party. For state officers it will support such men as it\r\n     deems competent and trustworthy, irrespective also of party,\r\n     and without regard to the \"Maine law.\" In a word, it avows\r\n     itself, for the present, if not forever, an independent\r\n     journal (it was pretty much so always), discarding party\r\n     usages, mandates, and platforms.\r\n\r\n     \"'We regret to lose, in the _Tribune_, an old, able, and\r\n     efficient co-labourer in the Whig vineyard. But when\r\n     carried away by its convictions of duty to other, and, in\r\n     its judgment, higher and more beneficent objects, we have as\r\n     little right as inclination to complain. The _Tribune_ takes\r\n     with it, wherever it goes, an indomitable and powerful pen,\r\n     a devoted, a noble, and an unselfish zeal. Its senior editor\r\n     evidently supposes himself permanently divorced from the\r\n     Whig party, but we shall be disappointed if, after a year or\r\n     two's sturdy pulling at the oar of reform, he does not\r\n     return to his long-cherished belief that great and\r\n     beneficent aims must continue, as they commenced, to be\r\n     wrought out through Whig instrumentalities.\r\n\r\n     \"'But we only intended to say that the _Tribune_ openly and\r\n     frankly avows its intention and policy; and that in things\r\n     about which we cannot agree, we can and will disagree as\r\n     friends.'\r\n\r\n\"Pray read this article again, if its purpose and import be not\r\nclearly understood! At the time it appeared, the _Tribune_ was under\r\nhigh pressure 'Maine law' speed. That question, in Mr. Greeley's view,\r\nwas paramount to all others. It was the _Tribune's_ 'higher law.' Mr.\r\nGreeley had given warning in his paper that he should support 'Maine\r\nlaw' candidates for the legislature, and for state offices, regardless\r\nof their political or party principles and character. And this, too,\r\nwhen senators to be elected had to choose a senator in Congress. But\r\ninstead of 'reading' Mr. Greeley 'out of the Whig party,' it will be\r\nseen that after Mr. Greeley had read himself out of the party by\r\ndiscarding 'party usages, mandates, and platforms,' the _Evening\r\nJournal_, in the language and spirit of friendship, predicted just\r\nwhat happened, namely, that, in due time, Mr. Greeley would 'return to\r\nhis long-cherished belief that great and beneficent aims must\r\ncontinue, as they commenced, to be wrought out through Whig\r\ninstrumentalities.'\r\n\r\n\"We submit, even to Mr. Greeley himself, whether there is one word or\r\nthought in the article to which he referred justifying his accusation\r\nthat he had been 'read out of the Whig party' by the _Evening\r\nJournal_.\r\n\r\n\"In December, 1837, when we sought the acquaintance and co-operation\r\nof Mr. Greeley, we were, like him, a 'poor printer,' working as hard\r\nas he worked. We had then been sole editor, reporter, news collector,\r\n'remarkable accident,' 'horrid murder,' 'items' man, etc., etc., for\r\nseven years, at a salary of $750, $1000, $1250, and $1500. We had also\r\nbeen working hard, for poor pay, as an editor and politician, for the\r\ntwelve years preceding 1830. We stood, therefore, on the same footing\r\nwith Mr. Greeley when the partnership was formed. We knew that Mr.\r\nGreeley was much abler, more indomitably industrious, and, as we\r\nbelieved, a better man in all respects. We foresaw for him a brilliant\r\nfuture; and, if we had not started with utterly erroneous views of his\r\nobjects, we do not believe that our relations would have jarred. We\r\nbelieved him indifferent alike to the temptations of money and office,\r\ndesiring only to become both 'useful' and 'ornamental,' as the editor\r\nof a patriotic, enlightened, leading, and influential public journal.\r\nFor years, therefore, we placed Horace Greeley far above the 'swell\r\nmob' of office-seekers, for whom, in his letter, he expresses so much\r\ncontempt. Had Governor Seward known, in 1838, that Mr. Greeley coveted\r\nan inspectorship, he certainly would have received it. Indeed, if our\r\nmemory be not at fault, Mr. Greeley was offered the clerkship of the\r\nAssembly in 1838. It was certainly pressed upon us, and, though at\r\nthat time, like Mr. Greeley, desperately poor, it was declined.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot think that Mr. Greeley's political friends, after the\r\n_Tribune_ was under way, knew that he needed the 'pecuniary aid' which\r\nhad been promised. When, about that period, we suggested to him (after\r\nconsulting some of the board) that the printing of the common council,\r\nmight be obtained, he refused to have anything to do with it.\r\n\r\n\"In relation to the state printing, Mr. Greeley knows that there never\r\nwas a day when, if he had chosen to come to Albany, he might not have\r\ntaken whatever interest he pleased in the _Journal_ and its state\r\nprinting. But he wisely regarded his position in New York, and the\r\nfuture of the _Tribune_, as far more desirable.\r\n\r\n\"For the 'creation of the new office for the _Times_,' Mr. Greeley\r\nknows perfectly well that Governor Seward was in no manner\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n\"That Mr. Greeley should make the adjustment of the libel suit of\r\nMessrs. Redfield and Pringle against the _Tribune_ a ground of\r\naccusation against Governor Seward is a matter of astonishment.\r\nGovernor Seward undertook the settlement of that suit as the friend of\r\nMr. Greeley, at a time when a systematic effort was being made to\r\ndestroy both the _Tribune_ and _Journal_ by prosecutions for libel. We\r\nwere literally plastered over with writs, declarations, etc. There\r\nwere at least two judges of the Supreme Court in the State, on whom\r\nplaintiffs were at liberty to count for verdicts. Governor Seward\r\ntendered his professional services to Mr. Greeley, and in the case\r\nreferred to, as in others, foiled the adversary. For such service this\r\nseems a strange requital. Less fortunate than the _Tribune_, it cost\r\nthe _Journal_ over $8000 to reach a point in legal proceedings that\r\nenabled a defendant in a libel suit to give the truth in evidence.\r\n\r\n\"It was by no fault or neglect or wish of Governor Seward that Mr.\r\nGreeley served but 'ninety days in Congress.' Nor will we say what\r\nothers have said, that his congressional _début_ was a failure. There\r\nwere no other reasons, and this seems a fitting occasion to state\r\nthem. Mr. Greeley's 'isms' were in his way at conventions. The sharp\r\npoints and rough edges of the _Tribune_ rendered him unacceptable to\r\nthose who nominate candidates. This was more so formerly than at\r\npresent, for most of the rampant reforms to which the _Tribune_ was\r\ndevoted have subsided. We had no sympathy with, and little respect\r\nfor, a constituency that preferred 'Jim' Brooks to Horace Greeley.\r\n\r\n\"Nearly forty years of experience leaves us in some doubt whether,\r\nwith political friends, an open, frank, and truthful, or a cautious,\r\ncalculating, non-committal course is not the right, but the easiest\r\nand most politic. The former, which we have chosen, has made us much\r\ntrouble and many enemies. Few candidates are able to bear the truth,\r\nor to believe that the friend who utters it is truly one.\r\n\r\n\"In 1854, the _Tribune_, through years of earnest effort, had educated\r\nthe people up to the point of demanding a 'Maine law' candidate for\r\ngovernor. But its followers would not accept their chief reformer! It\r\nwas evident that the state convention was to be largely influenced by\r\n'Maine law' and 'Choctaw' Know-Nothing delegates. It was equally\r\nevident that Mr. Greeley could neither be nominated nor elected. Hence\r\nthe conference to which he refers. We found, as on two other occasions\r\nduring thirty years, our state convention impracticable. We submitted\r\nthe names of Lieutenant-Governor Patterson and Judge Harris (both\r\ntemperance men in faith and practice) as candidates for governor,\r\ncoupled with that of Mr. Greeley for lieutenant-governor. But the\r\n'Maine law' men would have none of these, preferring Myron H. Clark\r\n(who used up the raw material of temperance), qualified by H.J.\r\nRaymond for lieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\n\"What Mr. Greeley says of the relative zeal and efficiency of the\r\n_Tribune_ and _Times_, and of our own feelings in that contest, is\r\ntrue. We did our duty, but with less of enthusiasm than when we were\r\nsupporting either Granger, Seward, Bradish, Hunt, Fish, King, or\r\nMorgan for governor.\r\n\r\n\"One word in relation to the supposed 'political firm.' Mr. Greeley\r\nbrought into it his full quota of capital. But were there no\r\nbeneficial results, no accruing advantages, to himself? Did he not\r\nattain, in the sixteen years, a high position, world-wide reputation,\r\nand an ample fortune? Admit, as we do, that he is not as wealthy as we\r\nwish he was, it is not because the _Tribune_ has not made his fortune,\r\nbut because he did not keep it--because it went, as other people's\r\nmoney goes, to friends, to pay indorsements, and in bad investments.\r\n\r\n\"We had both been liberally, nay, generously, sustained by our party.\r\nMr. Greeley differs with us in regarding patrons of newspapers as\r\nconferring favours. In giving them the worth of their money, he holds\r\nthat the account is balanced. We, on the other hand, have ever held\r\nthe relation of newspaper editor and subscriber as one of fraternity.\r\nViewed in this aspect, the editors of the _Tribune_ and _Evening\r\nJournal_ have manifold reasons for cherishing grateful recollections\r\nof the liberal and abiding confidence and patronage of their party and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, we cannot withhold an expression of sincere regret\r\nthat this letter has been called out. After remaining six years in\r\n'blissful ignorance' of its contents, we should have preferred to have\r\never remained so. It jars harshly upon cherished memories. It destroys\r\nideals of disinterestedness and generosity which relieved political\r\nlife from so much that is selfish, sordid, and rapacious.\"\r\n\r\nHenry B. Stanton once asked Seward, directly, if he did not think it\r\nwould have been better to let Greeley have office. \"Mr. Seward looked\r\nat me intently, rolled out a cloud of tobacco smoke, and then slowly\r\nresponded: 'I don't know but it would.'\"[578] It is doubtful, however,\r\nif Seward ever forgave a New Yorker who contributed to his defeat.\r\nLincoln spoke of him as \"without gall,\" but Stanton declared him a\r\ngood hater who lay in wait to punish his foes. Greeley, James S.\r\nWadsworth, William Cullen Bryant, and David Dudley Field,\r\nconspicuously led the opposition, and if he failed to annihilate them\r\nall it is because some of them did not give him a chance to strike\r\nback. Greeley caught the first knockout blow in February, 1861; and in\r\n1862, says Stanton, \"he doubtless defeated James S. Wadsworth for\r\ngovernor of New York. Wadsworth, who was then military commander of\r\nWashington, told me that Seward was 'dead against him' all through the\r\ncampaign.\"[579]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 578: H.B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, pp. 199, 200.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 579: _Ibid._, p. 216.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT OF THE FUSIONISTS\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the return of the Softs from Baltimore the condition of the\r\nDemocratic party became a subject of much anxiety. Dean Richmond's\r\npersistent use of the unit rule had driven the Hards into open\r\nrebellion, and at a great mass-meeting, held at Cooper Institute and\r\naddressed by Daniel S. Dickinson, it was agreed to hold a Breckenridge\r\nand Lane state convention at Syracuse on August 8. At the appointed\r\ntime three hundred delegates appeared, representing every county, but\r\nwith the notable exception of the chairman, Henry S. Randall, the\r\nbiographer of Thomas Jefferson, who had advocated the Wilmot Proviso\r\nin 1847, written the Buffalo platform in 1848, and opposed the\r\nfugitive slave law in 1850, practically all of them had steadily\r\nopposed the Free-soil influences of their party. To many it seemed\r\nstrange, if not absolutely ludicrous, to hoist a pro-slavery flag in\r\nthe Empire State. But Republicans welcomed the division of their\r\nopponents, and the Hards were terribly in earnest. They organised with\r\ndue formality; spent two days in conference; adopted the pro-slavery\r\nplatform of the seceders' convention amidst loud cheering; selected\r\ncandidates for a state and electoral ticket with the care that\r\nprecedes certain election; angrily denounced the leadership of Dean\r\nRichmond at Charleston and Baltimore; appointed a new state committee,\r\nand, with the usual assurance of determined men, claimed a large\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nThe indomitable Dickinson, in a speech not unlike his Cooper Institute\r\naddress, declared that Breckenridge, the regularly nominated candidate\r\nof seventeen States and portions of other States, would secure one\r\nhundred and twenty-seven electoral votes in the South and on the\r\nPacific coast. This made the election, he argued, depend upon New\r\nYork, and since Douglas would start without the hope of getting a\r\nsingle vote, it became the duty of every national Democrat to insist\r\nthat the Illinoisan be withdrawn. People might scoff at this movement\r\nas \"a cloud no bigger than a man's hand,\" he said, but it would grow\r\nin size and send forth a deluge that would refresh and purify the arid\r\nsoil of politics. The applause that greeted this prophecy indicated\r\nfaith in a principle that most people knew had outlived its day in the\r\nState; and, although Dickinson was always altogether on one side, it\r\nis scarcely credible that he could sincerely believe that New York\r\nwould support Breckenridge, even if Douglas withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe Hards conjured with a few distinguished names which still gave\r\nthem prestige. Charles O'Conor, Greene C. Bronson, and John A. Dix, as\r\nconservative, moderate leaders, undoubtedly had the confidence of many\r\npeople, and their ticket, headed by James T. Brady, the brilliant\r\nlawyer, looked formidable. Personally, Brady was perhaps the most\r\npopular man in New York City; and had he stood upon other than a\r\npro-slavery platform his support must have been generous. But the fact\r\nthat he advocated the protection of slave property in the territories,\r\nalthough opposed to Buchanan's Lecompton policy, was destined to\r\nsubject him to humiliating defeat.\r\n\r\nThe Softs met in convention on August 15. In numbers and noisy\r\nenthusiasm they did not seem to represent a larger following than the\r\nHards, but their principles expressed the real sentiment of whatever\r\nwas left of the rank and file of the Democratic party of the State.\r\nHoratio Seymour was the pivotal personage. Around him they rallied.\r\nThe resolution indorsing Stephen A. Douglas and his doctrine of\r\nnon-intervention very adroitly avoided quarrels. It accepted Fernando\r\nWood's delegation on equal terms with Tammany; refused to notice the\r\nHards' attack upon Dean Richmond and the majority of the Charleston\r\ndelegation; and nominated William Kelley of Hudson for governor by\r\nacclamation. Kelley was a large farmer of respectable character and\r\ntalents, who had served with credit in the State Senate and supported\r\nVan Buren in 1848 with the warmth of a sincere Free-soiler. He was\r\nevidently a man without guile, and, although modest and plain-spoken,\r\nhe knew what the farmer and workingman most wanted, and addressed\r\nhimself to their best thought. It was generally conceded that he would\r\npoll the full strength of his party.\r\n\r\nBut the cleverest act of the convention was its fusion with the\r\nConstitutional Union party. In the preceding May, the old-line Whigs\r\nand Know-Nothings had met at Baltimore and nominated John Bell of\r\nTennessee for President and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for Vice\r\nPresident, on the simple platform: \"The Constitution of the country,\r\nthe union of the States, and the enforcement of the laws.\" Washington\r\nHunt, the former governor of New York, had become the convention's\r\npresident, and, in company with James Brooks and William Duer, he had\r\narranged with the Softs to place on the Douglas electoral ticket ten\r\nrepresentatives of the Union party, with William Kent, the popular son\r\nof the distinguished Chancellor, at their head.\r\n\r\nHunt had become a thorn in the side of his old friends, now the\r\nleading Republican managers. He had joined them as a Whig in the\r\nthirties. After sending him to Congress for three terms and making him\r\ncomptroller of state in 1848, they had elected him governor in 1850;\r\nbut, in the division of the party, he joined the Silver-Grays, failed\r\nof re-election in 1852, dropped into the American party in 1854, and\r\nsupported Fillmore in 1856. Thurlow Weed thought he ought to have\r\naided them in the formation of the Republican party, and Horace\r\nGreeley occasionally reminded him that a decent regard for consistency\r\nshould impel him to act in accordance with his anti-slavery record;\r\nbut when, in 1860, Hunt began the crusade that successfully fused the\r\nDouglas and Bell tickets in New York, thus seriously endangering the\r\nelection of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican editors opened their\r\nbatteries upon him with well-directed aim. In his one attempt to face\r\nthese attacks, Hunt taunted Greeley with being \"more dangerous to\r\nfriend than to foe.\" To this the editor of the _Tribune_ retorted:\r\n\"When I was your friend, you were six times before the people as a\r\ncandidate for most desirable offices, and in five of those six were\r\nsuccessful, while you were repeatedly a candidate before and have been\r\nsince, and always defeated. Possibly some have found me a dangerous\r\nfriend, but you never did.\"[580]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 580: New York _Tribune_, July 23, 1860.]\r\n\r\nHunt's coalition movement, called the \"Syracuse juggle\" and the\r\n\"confusion ticket,\" did not work as smoothly as he expected. It gave\r\nrise to a bitter controversy which at once impaired its value. The\r\nBell negotiators declared that the ten electors, if chosen, would be\r\nfree to vote for their own candidate, while the Douglas mediators\r\nstated with emphasis that each elector was not only pledged by the\r\nresolution of the convention to support Douglas, but was required to\r\ngive his consent to do so or allow another to fill his place. \"We\r\ncannot tell which answer is right,\" said the New York _Sun_, \"but it\r\nlooks as if there were deception practised.\" The _Tribune_ presented\r\nthe ridiculous phase of it when it declared that the Bell electors\r\nwere put up to catch the Know-Nothings, while the others would trap\r\nthe Irish and Germans. \"Is this the way,\" it asked, referring to\r\nWilliam Kent and his associates, \"in which honourable men who have\r\ncharacters to support, conduct political contests?\"[581] To dissipate\r\nthe confusion, Hunt explained that the defeat of Lincoln would\r\nprobably throw the election into Congress, in which event Bell would\r\nbecome President. \"But we declare, with the same frankness, that if\r\nDouglas, and not Bell, shall become President, we will welcome that\r\nresult as greatly preferable to the success of sectional\r\ncandidates.\"[582]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 581: _Ibid._, July 14, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 582: _Ibid._, July 24, 1860.]\r\n\r\nThe Republican state convention which met at Syracuse on August 22,\r\ndid not muffle its enthusiasm over the schism in the Democratic\r\nparty. Seward and his friends had regained their composure. A\r\nmidsummer trip to New England, chiefly for recreation, had brought\r\ngreat crowds about the Auburn statesmen wherever he appeared, and,\r\nencouraged by their enthusiastic devotion, he returned satisfied with\r\nthe place he held in the hearts of Republicans. His followers, too,\r\nindicated their disappointment by no public word or sign. To the end\r\nof the convention its proceedings were marked by harmony and\r\nunanimity. Edwin D. Morgan was renominated for governor by\r\nacclamation; the platform of Chicago principles was adopted amidst\r\nprolonged cheers, and the selection of electors approved without\r\ndissent. The happy combination of the two electors-at-large, William\r\nCullen Bryant and James O. Putnam, evidenced the spirit of loyalty to\r\nAbraham Lincoln that inspired all participants. Bryant had been an\r\noracle of the radical democracy for more than twenty years, and had\r\nstubbornly opposed Seward; Putnam, a Whig of the school of Clay and\r\nWebster, had, until recently, zealously supported Millard Fillmore and\r\nthe American party. In its eagerness to unite every phase of\r\nanti-slavery sentiment the convention buried the past in its desire to\r\nknow, in the words of Seward, \"whether this is a constitutional\r\ngovernment under which we live.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign, Republican demonstrations glorified Lincoln's\r\nearly occupation of rail-splitting, while the Wide-awakes, composed\r\nlargely of young men who had studied the slavery question since 1852\r\nsolely as a moral issue, illuminated the night and aroused enthusiasm\r\nwith their torches and expert marching. As early as in September, the\r\nNew York _Herald_ estimated that over four hundred thousand were\r\nalready uniformed and drilled. In every town and village these\r\norganisations, unique then, although common enough nowadays, were\r\nconscious appeals for sympathy and favour, and undoubtedly contributed\r\nmuch to the result by enlisting the hearty support of first voters.\r\nIndeed, on the Republican side, it was largely a campaign of young\r\nmen. \"The Republican party,\" said Seward at Cleveland, \"is a party\r\nchiefly of young men. Each successive year brings into its ranks an\r\nincreasing proportion of the young men of this country.\"[583]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 583: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 462.\r\n_Seward's Works_, Vol. 4, p. 384.]\r\n\r\nAside from the torch-light processions of the Wide-awakes, the almost\r\nnumberless speeches were the feature of the canvass of 1860. There\r\nhad, perhaps, been more exciting and enthusiastic campaigns, but the\r\nnumber of meetings was without precedent. The _Tribune_ estimated that\r\nten thousand set addresses were made in New York alone, and that the\r\nnumber in the country equalled all that had been made in previous\r\npresidential canvasses since 1789. It is likewise true that at no time\r\nin the history of the State did so many distinguished men take part in\r\na campaign. Though the clergy were not so obtrusive as in 1856, Henry\r\nWard Beecher and Edwin H. Chapin, the eminent Universalist, did not\r\nhesitate to deliver political sermons from their pulpits, closing\r\ntheir campaign on the Sunday evening before election.\r\n\r\nBut the New Yorker whom the Republican masses most desired to hear and\r\nsee was William H. Seward. Accordingly, in the latter part of August\r\nhe started on a five weeks' tour through the Western States, beginning\r\nat Detroit and closing at Cleveland. At every point where train or\r\nsteamboat stopped, if only for fifteen minutes, thousands of people\r\nawaited his coming. The day he spoke in Chicago, it was estimated that\r\ntwo hundred thousand visitors came to that city. Rhodes suggests that\r\n\"it was then he reached the climax of his career.\"[584]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 584: \"Seward filled the minds of Republicans, attracting\r\nsuch attention and honour, and arousing such enthusiasm, that the\r\nclosing months of the campaign were the most brilliant epoch of his\r\nlife.

But in freshness of thought and kaleidoscopic\r\nphraseology, they were attractive, full of eloquence, and of\r\nstatesmanlike comment, lifting the campaign, then just opening, upon\r\na high plane of political and moral patriotism. He avoided all\r\npersonalities; he indicated no disappointment;[585] his praise of\r\nLincoln was in excellent taste; and without evasion or concealment,\r\nbut with a ripeness of experience that had mellowed and enlightened\r\nhim, he talked of \"higher law\" and the \"irrepressible conflict\" in\r\nterms that made men welcome rather than fear their discussion. \"Let\r\nthis battle be decided in favour of freedom in the territories,\" he\r\ndeclared, \"and not one slave will ever be carried into the territories\r\nof the United States, and that will end the irrepressible\r\nconflict.\"[586]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 585: \"Seward charged his defeat chiefly to Greeley. He felt\r\ntoward that influential editor as much vindictiveness as was possible\r\nin a man of so amiable a nature. But he did not retire to his\r\ntent.\"--James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n494.\r\n\r\n\"The magnanimity of Mr. Seward, since the result of the convention was\r\nknown,\" wrote James Russell Lowell, \"has been a greater ornament to\r\nhim and a greater honour to his party than his election to the\r\nPresidency would have been.\"--_Atlantic Monthly_, October, 1860;\r\n_Lowell's Political Essays_, p. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 586: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, pp.\r\n462-66.]\r\n\r\nThe growth and resources of the great Northwest, whose development he\r\nattributed to the exclusion of slave labour, seemed to inspire him\r\nwith the hope and faith of youth, and he spoke of its reservation for\r\nfreedom and its settlement and upbuilding in the critical moment of\r\nthe country's history as providential, since it must rally the free\r\nStates of the Atlantic coast to call back the ancient principles which\r\nhad been abandoned by the government to slavery. \"We resign to you,\"\r\nhe said, \"the banner of human rights and human liberty on this\r\ncontinent, and we bid you be firm, bold, and onward, and then you may\r\nhope that we will be able to follow you.\" It was in one of these\r\nmoments of exaltation when he seemed to be lifted into the higher\r\ndomain of prophecy that he made the prediction afterward realised by\r\nthe Alaska treaty. \"Standing here and looking far off into the\r\nNorthwest,\" he said, \"I see the Russian as he busily occupies himself\r\nin establishing seaports and towns and fortifications on the verge of\r\nthis continent as the outposts of St. Petersburg, and I can say, 'Go\r\non, and build up your outposts all along the coast, up even to the\r\nArctic Ocean, for they will yet become the outposts of my own\r\ncountry--monuments of the civilisation of the United States in the\r\nNorthwest.\"[587]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 587: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 464.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the canvass, Republican confidence and enthusiasm\r\ncontrasted strangely with the apathy of the Democratic party, caused\r\nby its two tickets, two organisations, and two incompatible platforms.\r\nIt was recognised early in the campaign that Douglas could carry no\r\nslave State unless it be Missouri; and, although the Douglas and Bell\r\nfusion awaked some hope, it was not until the fusion electoral ticket\r\nincluded supporters of Breckenridge that the struggle became vehement\r\nand energetic. New York's thirty-five votes were essential to the\r\nelection of Lincoln, and early in September a determined effort began\r\nto unite the three parties against him. The Hards resisted the\r\nmovement, but many merchants and capitalists of New York City,\r\napprehensive of the dissolution of the Union if Lincoln were elected,\r\nand promising large sums of money to the campaign, forced the\r\nsubstitution of seven Breckenridge electors in place of as many\r\nDouglas supporters, giving Bell ten, Breckenridge seven, and Douglas\r\neighteen. \"It is understood,\" said the _Tribune_, \"that four nabobs\r\nhave already subscribed twenty-five thousand dollars each, and that\r\none million is to be raised.\"[588]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 588: New York _Tribune_, October 19, 1860.]\r\n\r\nAll this disturbed Lincoln. \"I think there will be the most\r\nextraordinary effort ever made to carry New York for Douglas,\" he\r\nwrote Weed on August 17. \"You and all others who write me from your\r\nState think the effort cannot succeed, and I hope you are right.\r\nStill, it will require close watching and great efforts on the other\r\nside.\"[589] After fusion did succeed, the Republican managers found\r\nencouragement in the fact that a majority of the Americans in the\r\nwestern part of the State,[590] following the lead of Putnam,\r\nbelonged to the party of Lincoln, while the Germans gave comforting\r\nevidence of their support. On his return from the West Seward assured\r\nLincoln \"that this State will redeem all the pledges we have\r\nmade.\"[591] Then came the October verdict from Pennsylvania and\r\nIndiana. \"Emancipation or revolution is now upon us,\" said the\r\nCharleston _Mercury_.[592] Yet the hope of the New York fusionists,\r\nencouraged by a stock panic in Wall Street and by the unconcealed\r\nstatement of Howell Cobb of Georgia, then secretary of the treasury,\r\nthat Lincoln's election would be followed by disunion and a serious\r\nderangement of the financial interests of the country, kept the Empire\r\nState violently excited. It was reported in Southern newspapers that\r\nWilliam B. Astor had contributed one million of dollars in aid of the\r\nfusion ticket.[593] It was a formidable combination of elements.\r\nHeretofore the Republican party had defeated them separately--now it\r\nmet them as a united whole, when antagonisms, ceasing to be those of\r\nrational debate, had become those of fierce and furious passion.\r\nGreeley pronounced it \"a struggle as intense, as vehement, and as\r\nenergetic, as had ever been known,\" in New York.[594] Yet Thurlow\r\nWeed's confidence never wavered. \"The fusion leaders have largely\r\nincreased their fund,\" he wrote Lincoln, three days before the\r\nelection, \"and they are now using money lavishly. This stimulates and\r\nto some extent inspires confidence, and all the confederates are at\r\nwork. Some of our friends are nervous. But I have no fear of the\r\nresult in this State.\"[595]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 589: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n297.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 590: \"The names of eighty-one thousand New York men who\r\nvoted for Fillmore in 1856 are inscribed on Republican poll-lists.\"--New\r\nYork _Tribune_, September 11, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 591: F.W.

Before midnight they\r\nforeshadowed Lincoln's success, and the next morning's _Tribune_\r\nestimated that the Republicans had carried the electoral and state\r\ntickets by 30,000 to 50,000, with both branches of the Legislature and\r\ntwenty-three out of thirty-three congressmen. The official figures did\r\nnot change this prophecy, except to fix Lincoln's majority at 50,136\r\nand Morgan's plurality at 63,460. Lincoln received 4374 votes more\r\nthan Morgan, but Kelley ran 27,698 behind the fusion electoral ticket,\r\nshowing that the Bell and Everett men declined to vote for the Softs'\r\ncandidate for governor. Brady's total vote, 19,841, marked the\r\npro-slavery candidate's small support, leaving Morgan a clear majority\r\nof 43,619.[596] \"Mr. Dickinson and myself,\" said James T. Brady, six\r\nyears later, in his tribute to the former's memory, \"belonged to the\r\nsmall, despairing band in this State who carried into the political\r\ncontest of the North, for the last time, the flag of the South,\r\ncontending that the South should enjoy to the utmost, and with liberal\r\nrecognition, all the rights she could fairly claim under the\r\nConstitution of the United States. How small that band was all\r\nfamiliar with the political history of this State can tell.\"[597]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 596: Edwin D. Morgan, 358,272; William Kelley, 294,812;\r\nJames T.

On the other hand, the Republicans had regarded\r\nSouthern threats as largely buncombe. They had been heard in 1820, in\r\n1850, and so frequently in debate leading up to the contest in 1860,\r\nthat William H. Seward, the most powerful leader of opinion in his\r\nparty, had declared: \"These hasty threats of disunion are so unnatural\r\nthat they will find no hand to execute them.\"[598]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 598: Speech of February 29, 1860: _Seward's Works_, Vol. 4,\r\np. 619.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when, on November 16, the South Carolina Legislature\r\npassed an act calling a convention to meet on December 17, the\r\nRepublicans, still enthusiastic over their success, began seriously to\r\nconsider the question of disunion. \"Do you think the South will\r\nsecede?\" became as common a salutation as \"Good-morning;\" and,\r\nalthough a few New Yorkers, perhaps, gave the indifferent reply of\r\nHenry Ward Beecher--\"I don't believe they will; and I don't care if\r\nthey do\"[599]--the gloom and uncertainty which hung over business\r\ncircles made all anxious to hear from the leaders of their party.\r\nHeretofore, Horace Greeley, Thurlow Weed, and William H. Seward,\r\nbacked by Henry J. Raymond of the New York _Times_ and James Watson\r\nWebb of the _Courier_, had been quick to meet any emergency, and their\r\nfollowers now looked to them for direction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 599: New York _Tribune_, November 30, 1860. The quotation is\r\nfrom an address delivered in Boston.]\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley was admittedly the most influential Republican\r\njournalist. He had not always agreed with the leaders, and just now an\r\nopen break existed in the relations of himself and the powerful\r\ntriumvirate headed by Thurlow Weed; but Greeley had voiced the\r\nsentiment of the rank and file of his party more often than he had\r\nmisstated it, and the _Tribune_ readers naturally turned to their\r\nprophet for a solution of the pending trouble. As usual, he had an\r\nopinion. The election occurred on November 6, and on the 9th he\r\ndeclared that \"if the cotton States shall decide that they can do\r\nbetter out of the Union than in it, we insist on letting them go in\r\npeace. The right to secede may be a revolutionary one, but it exists\r\nnevertheless.... Whenever a considerable section of our Union shall\r\ndeliberately resolve to go out, we shall resist all coercive measures\r\ndesigned to keep it in. We hope never to live in a republic, whereof\r\none section is pinned to the residue by bayonets.\"[600] Two weeks\r\nlater, on November 26, he practically repeated these views. \"If the\r\ncotton States unitedly and earnestly wish to withdraw peacefully from\r\nthe Union, we think they should and would be allowed to go. Any\r\nattempt to compel them by force to remain would be contrary to the\r\nprinciples enunciated in the immortal Declaration of Independence,\r\ncontrary to the fundamental ideas on which human liberty is\r\nbased.\"[601] As late as December 17, when South Carolina and other\r\nSouthern States were on the threshold of secession, Greeley declared\r\nthat \"if the Declaration of Independence justified the secession from\r\nthe British Empire of three millions of colonists in 1776, we do not\r\nsee why it should not justify the secession of five millions of\r\nSouthrons from the Union in 1861.\"[602] In January, he recanted in a\r\nmeasure. Yet, on February 23, he announced that \"Whenever it shall be\r\nclear that the great body of the Southern people have become\r\nconclusively alienated from the Union, and anxious to escape from it,\r\nwe will do our best to forward their views.\"[603]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 600: New York _Tribune_, November 9, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 601: _Ibid._, November 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 602: New York _Tribune_, December 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 603: _Ibid._, February 23.]\r\n\r\nHenry Ward Beecher[604] and the Garrison Abolitionists[605] also\r\ninclined to this view; and, in November and December, a few\r\nRepublicans, because of a general repugnance to the coercion of a\r\nState, did not despise it. Naturally, however, the Greeley policy did\r\nnot please the great bulk of Lincoln's intelligent supporters. The\r\nbelief obtained that, the election having been fair and\r\nconstitutional, the South ought to submit to the decision as readily\r\nas Northern Democrats acquiesced in it. Besides, a spontaneous feeling\r\nexisted that the United States was a nation, that secession was\r\ntreason, and seceders were traitors. Such people sighed for \"an hour\r\nof Andrew Jackson;\" and, to supply the popular demand, Jackson's\r\nproclamation against the nullifiers, written by Edward Livingston, a\r\nnative of New York, then secretary of state, was published in a cheap\r\nand convenient edition. To the readers of such literature Greeley's\r\npeaceable secession seemed like the erratic policy of an eccentric\r\nthinker, and its promulgation, especially when it began giving comfort\r\nand encouragement to the South, contributed not a little to the defeat\r\nof its author for the United States Senate in the following February.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 604: _Ibid._, November 30. \"In so far as the Free States are\r\nconcerned,\" he said, \"I hold that it will be an advantage for the\r\nSouth to go off.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 605: _The Liberator_, November and December.]\r\n\r\nThurlow Weed also had a plan, which quickly attracted the attention of\r\npeople in the South as well as in the North. He held that suggestions\r\nof compromise which the South could accept might be proposed without\r\ndishonour to the victors in the last election, and, in several\r\ncarefully written editorials in the _Evening Journal_, he argued in\r\nfavour of restoring the old line of the Missouri Compromise, and of\r\nsubstituting for the fugitive slave act, payment for rescued slaves by\r\nthe counties in which the violation of law occurred. \"When we refer,\r\nas we often do, triumphantly to the example of England,\" he said, \"we\r\nare prone to forget that emancipation and compensation were provisions\r\nof the same act of Parliament.\"[606]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 606: Albany _Evening Journal_, November 26, 1860.]\r\n\r\nWeed was now sixty-three years of age--not an old man, and of little\r\nless energy than in 1824, when he drove about the State in his first\r\nencounter with Martin Van Buren. The success of the views he had\r\nfearlessly maintained, in defiance of menacing opponents, had been\r\nachieved in full measure, and he had reason to be proud of his\r\nconspicuous part in the result; but now, in the presence of secession\r\nwhich threatened the country because of that success, he seemed\r\nsuddenly to revolt against the policy he himself had fostered. As his\r\nbiographer expressed it, \"he cast aside the weapons which none could\r\nwield so well,\"[607] and, betraying the influences of his early\r\ntraining under the great Whig leaders, began to show his love for the\r\nUnion after the manner of Clay and Webster.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 607: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n306.]\r\n\r\nWeed outlined his policy with rare skill, hoping that the discussion\r\nprovoked by it might result in working out some plan to avoid\r\ndisunion.[608] Raymond, in the _Times_, and Webb in the _Courier_,\r\ngave it cordial support; the leading New York business men of all\r\nparties expressed themselves favourable to conciliation and\r\ncompromise. \"I can assure you,\" wrote August Belmont to Governor\r\nSprague of Rhode Island, on December 13, \"that all the leaders of the\r\nRepublican party in our State and city, with a few exceptions of the\r\nultra radicals, are in favour of concessions, and that the popular\r\nmind of the North is ripe for them.\" On December 19 he wrote again:\r\n\"Last evening I was present at an informal meeting of about thirty\r\ngentlemen, comprising our leading men, Republicans, Union men, and\r\nDemocrats, composed of such names as Astor, Aspinwall, Moses H.\r\nGrinnell, Hamilton Fish, R.M. Blatchford, &c. They were unanimous in\r\ntheir voice for reconciliation, and that the first steps have to be\r\ntaken by the North.\"[609]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 608: Albany _Evening Journal_, December 1, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 609: _Letters of August Belmont_, privately printed, pp. 15,\r\n16.]\r\n\r\nBelmont undoubtedly voiced the New York supporters of Douglas,\r\nBreckenridge, and Bell, and many conservative Republicans,\r\nrepresenting the business interests of the great metropolis; but the\r\nbulk of the Republicans did not like a plan that overthrew the\r\ncornerstone of their party, which had won on its opposition to the\r\nextension of slavery into free territory. To go back to the line of\r\n36° 30´, permitting slavery to the south of it, meant the loss of all\r\nthat had been gained, and a renewal of old issues and hostilities in\r\nthe near future. Republican congressmen from the State, almost without\r\nexception, yielded to this view, voicing the sentiment that it was\r\nvain to temporise longer with compromises. With fluent invective,\r\nJames B. McKean of Saratoga assailed the South in a speech that\r\nrecalled the eloquence of John W. Taylor, his distinguished\r\npredecessor, who, in 1820, led the forces of freedom against the\r\nMissouri Compromise. \"The slave-holders,\" he said, \"have been fairly\r\ndefeated in a presidential election. They now demand that the victors\r\nshall concede to the vanquished all that the latter have ever claimed,\r\nand vastly more than they could secure when they themselves were\r\nvictors. They take their principles in one hand, and the sword in the\r\nother, and reaching out the former they say to us, 'Take these for\r\nyour own, or we will strike.'\"[610]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 610: _Congressional Globe_, 1860-61, _Appendix_, p. 221.\r\n\"Never, with my consent, shall the Constitution ordain or protect\r\nhuman slavery in any territory. Where it exists by law I will\r\nrecognise it, but never shall it be extended over one acre of free\r\nterritory.\" Speech of James Humphrey of Brooklyn.--_Ibid._, p. 158.\r\n\"Why should we now make any concessions to them? With our experience\r\nof the little importance attached to former compromises by the South,\r\nit is ridiculous to talk about entering into another. The restoration\r\nof the Missouri line, with the protection of slavery south of it, will\r\nnot save the Union.\" Speech of John B. Haskin of Fordham.--_Ibid._, p.\r\n264. \"The people of the North regard the election of Mr. Lincoln as\r\nthe assurance that the day of compromise has ended; that henceforth\r\nslavery shall have all the consideration which is constitutionally due\r\nit and no more; that freedom shall have all its rights recognised and\r\nrespected.\" Speech of Charles L. Beale of Kinderhook.--_Ibid._, p.\r\n974. \"We of the North are called upon to save the Union by making\r\nconcessions and giving new guarantees to the South.... But I am\r\nopposed to tinkering with the Constitution, especially in these\r\nexciting times. I am satisfied with it as it is.\" Speech of Alfred Ely\r\nof Rochester.--_Ibid._, _Appendix_, p. 243. \"I should be opposed to\r\nany alteration of the Constitution which would extend the area of\r\nslavery.\" Speech of Luther C. Carter of Flushing.--_Ibid._, p. 278. \"I\r\nam opposed to all changes in the Constitution whatever.\" Edwin R.\r\nReynolds of Albion.--_Ibid._, p. 1008.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Weed kept at work. In an elaborate article, he suggested\r\na \"Convention of the people consisting of delegates appointed by the\r\nStates, to which North and South might bring their respective griefs,\r\nclaims, and reforms to a common arbitrament, to meet, discuss, and\r\ndetermine upon a future. It will be said that we have done nothing\r\nwrong, and have nothing to offer. This is precisely why we should both\r\npurpose and offer whatever may, by possibility, avert the evils of\r\ncivil war and prevent the destruction of our hitherto unexampled\r\nblessings of Union.\"[611]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 611: Albany _Evening Journal_, November 30, 1860.]\r\n\r\nPreston King, the junior United States senator from New York, clearly\r\nvoicing the sentiment of the majority of his party in Congress and out\r\nof it, bitterly opposed such a policy. \"It cannot be done,\" he wrote\r\nWeed, on December 7. \"You must abandon your position. It will prove\r\ndistasteful to the majority of those whom you have hitherto led. You\r\nand Seward should be among the foremost to brandish the lance and\r\nshout for joy.\"[612] To this the famous editor, giving a succinct view\r\nof his policy, replied with his usual directness. \"I have not dreamed\r\nof anything inconsistent with Republican duty. We owe our existence as\r\na party to the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. But for the ever\r\nblind spirit of slavery, Buchanan would have taken away our ammunition\r\nand spiked our guns. The continued blindness of Democracy and the\r\ncontinued madness of slavery enabled us to elect Lincoln. That success\r\nends our mission so far as Kansas and the encroachments of slavery\r\ninto free territory are concerned. We have no territory that invites\r\nslavery for any other than political objects, and with the power of\r\nterritorial organisation in the hands of Lincoln, there is no\r\npolitical temptation in all the territory belonging to us. The fight\r\nis over. Practically, the issues of the late campaign are obsolete. If\r\nthe Republican members of Congress stand still, we shall have a\r\ndivided North and a united South. If they move promptly, there will be\r\na divided South and a united North.\"[613]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 612: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n309.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 613: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n309.]\r\n\r\nIt is not, perhaps, surprising that Weed found so much to say in\r\nfavour of his proposition, since the same compromise and the same\r\narguments were made use of a few weeks later by no less a person than\r\nthe venerable John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, the Nestor of the United\r\nStates Senate. Crittenden was ten years older than Weed, and, like\r\nhim, was actuated by sincere patriotism. Although his compromise\r\ncontained six proposed amendments to the Constitution, it was believed\r\nthat all differences between the sections could easily be adjusted\r\nafter the acceptance of the first article, which recognised slavery as\r\nexisting south of latitude 36° 30´, and pledged it protection \"as\r\nproperty by all the departments of the territorial government during\r\nits continuance.\" The article also provided that States should be\r\nadmitted from territory either north or south of that line, with or\r\nwithout slavery, as their constitutions might declare.[614] This part\r\nof the compromise was not new to Congress or to the country. It had\r\nbeen made, on behalf of the South, in 1847, and defeated by a vote of\r\n114 to 82, only four Northern Democrats sustaining it. It was again\r\ndefeated more decisively in 1848, when proposed by Douglas. \"Thus the\r\nNorth,\" wrote Greeley, \"under the lead of the Republicans, was\r\nrequired, in 1860, to make, on pain of civil war, concessions to\r\nslavery which it had utterly refused when divided only between the\r\nconservative parties of a few years before.\"[615]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 614: The full text of the Crittenden compromise is given in\r\nthe _Congressional Globe_, 1861, p. 114; also in Horace Greeley's\r\n_American Conflict_, Vol. 1, p. 376.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 615: Horace Greeley, _The American Conflict_, Vol. 1, pp.\r\n378, 379.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Crittenden proposition invoked the same influences\r\nthat supported the Weed plan. \"I would most cheerfully accept it,\"\r\nwrote John A. Dix. \"I feel a strong confidence that we could carry\r\nthree-fourths of the States in favour of it as an amendment to the\r\nConstitution.\"[616] August Belmont said he had \"yet to meet the first\r\nconservative Union-loving man, in or out of politics, who does not\r\napprove of your compromise propositions.... In our own city and State\r\nsome of the most prominent men are ready to follow the lead of Weed.\r\nRestoration of the Missouri line finds favour with most of the\r\nconservative Republicans, and their number is increasing daily.\"[617]\r\nBelmont, now more than earlier in the month, undoubtedly expressed a\r\nripening sentiment that was fostered by the gloomy state of trade,\r\ncreating feverish conditions in the stock market, forcing New York\r\nbanks to issue clearing-house certificates, and causing a marked\r\ndecline in the Republican vote at the municipal election in\r\nHudson.[618] Indeed, there is abundant evidence that the Crittenden\r\nproposition, if promptly carried out in December, might have resulted\r\nin peace. The Senate committee of thirteen to whom it was\r\nreferred--consisting of two senators from the cotton States, three\r\nfrom the border States, three Northern Democrats, and five\r\nRepublicans--decided that no report should be adopted unless it had\r\nthe assent of a majority of the Republicans, and also a majority of\r\nthe eight other members. Six of the eight voted for it. All the\r\nRepublicans, and Jefferson Davis and Robert Toombs, representing the\r\ncotton States, voted against it. The evidence however, is almost\r\nconvincing that Davis and Toombs would have supported it in December\r\nif the Republicans had voted for it. In speeches in the open Senate,\r\nDouglas declared it,[619] Toombs admitted it,[620] and Davis implied\r\nit.[621] Seward sounds the only note of their insincerity. \"I think,\"\r\nhe said, in a letter to the President-elect, \"that Georgia, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, and Louisiana could not be arrested, even if we should\r\noffer all you suggest, and with it the restoration of the Missouri\r\nCompromise line. But persons acting for those States intimate that\r\nthey might be so arrested, because they think that the Republicans are\r\nnot going to concede the restoration of that line.\"[622] It is likely\r\nSeward hesitated to believe that his vote against the compromise, for\r\nwhatever reason it was given, helped to inaugurate hostilities; and\r\nyet nothing is clearer, in spite of his letter to Lincoln, than that\r\nin December the Republicans defeated the Crittenden compromise, the\r\nadoption of which would have prevented civil war.[623]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 616: Coleman, _Life of John J.

Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 155.]\r\n\r\nIn deference to the wishes of Lincoln and of his friends, who were\r\ngrooming him for United States senator, Greeley, before the end of\r\nDecember, had, in a measure, given up his damaging doctrine of\r\npeaceable secession, and accepted the \"no compromise\" policy, laid\r\ndown by Benjamin F. Wade, as \"the only true, the only honest, the only\r\nsafe doctrine.\"[624] It was necessary to Greeley's position just then,\r\nand to the stage of development which his candidacy had reached, that\r\nhe should oppose Weed's compromise. On the 22d of December, therefore,\r\nhe wrote the President-elect: \"I fear nothing, care for nothing, but\r\nanother disgraceful backdown of the free States. That is the only real\r\ndanger. Let the Union slide--it may be reconstructed; let Presidents\r\nbe assassinated--we can elect more; let the Republicans be defeated\r\nand crushed--we shall rise again. But another nasty compromise,\r\nwhereby everything is conceded and nothing secured, will so thoroughly\r\ndisgrace and humiliate us that we can never raise our heads, and this\r\ncountry becomes a second edition of the Barbary States, as they were\r\nsixty years ago. 'Take any form but that.'\"[625] On the same day the\r\n_Tribune_ announced that \"Mr. Lincoln is utterly opposed to any\r\nconcession or compromise that shall yield one iota of the position\r\noccupied by the Republican party on the subject of slavery in the\r\nterritories, and that he stands now, as he stood in May last, when he\r\naccepted the nomination for the Presidency, square upon the Chicago\r\nplatform.\"[626] Thus Lincoln had reassured Greeley's shrinking faith,\r\nand thenceforward his powerful journal took a more healthy and hopeful\r\ntone.[627]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 624: New York _Tribune_, December 19, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 625: Nicolay and Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 3, p. 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 626: New York _Tribune_, December 22, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 627: Nicolay and Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 3, p. 258.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, Weed laboured for the Crittenden compromise. He went to\r\nWashington, interviewed Republican members of Congress, and finally\r\nvisited Lincoln at Springfield. Tickling the ear with a pleasing\r\nsentiment and alliteration, he wanted Republicans, he said, \"to meet\r\nsecession as patriots and not as partisans.\"[628] He especially urged\r\nforbearance and concession out of consideration for Union men in\r\nSouthern States. \"Apprehending that we should be called upon to test\r\nthe strength of the Government,\" he wrote, on January 9, 1861, \"we\r\nsaw, what is even more apparent now, that the effort would tax all its\r\nfaculties and strain all its energies. Hence our desire before the\r\ntrial came to make up a record that would challenge the approval of\r\nthe world. This was due not less to ourselves than to the Union men of\r\nSouthern States, who, with equal patriotism and more of sacrifice,\r\namidst the pitiless peltings of the disunion storm, sought, like the\r\ndove sent out from the ark, a dry spot on which to set their\r\nfeet.\"[629]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 628: _Ibid._, p. 261.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 629: Albany _Evening Journal_, January 9, 1861.]\r\n\r\nWeed's sincerity remained unquestioned, and his opinion, so ardently\r\nsupported outside his party, would probably have had weight within his\r\nparty under other conditions; but the President-elect, with his mind\r\ninflexibly made up on the question of extending slavery into the\r\nterritories, refused to yield the cardinal principle of the Chicago\r\nplatform. \"Entertain no proposition for a compromise in regard to the\r\nextension of slavery,\" he wrote, December 11, to William Kellogg, a\r\nmember of Congress from Illinois. \"The instant you do, they have us\r\nunder again; all our labour is lost, and sooner or later must be done\r\nover.... The tug has to come, and better now than later. You know I\r\nthink the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution ought to be\r\nenforced--to put it in its mildest form, ought not to be\r\nresisted.\"[630] Two days later, in a letter to E.B. Washburne, also an\r\nIllinois member of Congress, he objected to the scheme for restoring\r\nthe Missouri Compromise line. \"Let that be done and immediately\r\nfilibustering and extending slavery recommences. On that point hold\r\nfirm as a chain of steel.\"[631] To Weed himself, on December 17, he\r\nrepeated the same idea in almost the identical language.[632]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 630: Nicolay and Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 3, p. 259.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 631: _Ibid._, Vol. 3, p. 259.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 632: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2,\r\npp. 310, 311.]\r\n\r\nThurlow Weed was a journalist of pre-eminent ability, and, although a\r\nstrenuous, hard hitter, who gave everybody as much sport as he wanted,\r\nhe was a fair fighter, whom the bitterest critics of the radical\r\nRepublican press united in praising for his consistency; but his\r\nepigrams and incisive arguments, sending a vibrating note of\r\nearnestness across the Alleghanies, could not move the modest and, as\r\nyet, unknown man of the West, who, unswayed by the fears of Wall\r\nStreet, and the teachings of the great Whig compromisers, saw with a\r\nstatesman's clearness the principle that explained the reason for his\r\nparty's existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nSEYMOUR AND THE PEACE DEMOCRATS\r\n\r\n1860-1861\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the contest over secession was raising its crop of disturbance\r\nand disorder at Washington, newspapers and politicians in the North\r\ncontinued to discuss public questions from their party standpoints.\r\nRepublicans inveighed against the madness of pro-slavery leaders,\r\nDemocrats berated Republicans as the responsible authors of the perils\r\ndarkening the national skies, and Bell men sought for a compromise.\r\nFour days after the election of Lincoln, the Albany _Argus_ clearly\r\nand temperately expressed the view generally taken of the secession\r\nmovement by Democratic journals of New York. \"We are not at all\r\nsurprised at the manifestations of feeling at the South,\" it said. \"We\r\nexpected and predicted it; and for so doing were charged by the\r\nRepublican press with favouring disunion; while, in fact, we simply\r\ncorrectly appreciated the feeling of that section of the Union. We\r\nsympathise with and justify the South, as far as this--their rights\r\nhave been invaded to the extreme limit possible within the forms of\r\nthe Constitution; and, if we deemed it certain that the real animus of\r\nthe Republican party could become the permanent policy of the nation,\r\nwe should think that all the instincts of self-preservation and of\r\nmanhood rightfully impelled them to resort to revolution and a\r\nseparation from the Union, and we would applaud them and wish them\r\nGod-speed in the adoption of such a remedy.\"[633]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 633: Albany _Argus_, November 10, 1860. On November 12 the\r\nRochester _Union_ argued that the threatened secession of the slave\r\nStates was but a counterpoise of the personal liberty bills and other\r\nmeasures of antagonism to slave-holding at the North. See, also, the\r\nNew York _Herald_, November 9.]\r\n\r\nThis was published in the heat of party conflict and Democratic\r\ndefeat, when writers assumed that a compromise, if any adjustment was\r\nneeded, would, of course, be forthcoming as in 1850. A little later,\r\nas conditions became more threatening, the talk of peaceable secession\r\ngrowing out of a disinclination to accept civil war, commended itself\r\nto persons who thought a peaceful dissolution of the Union, if the\r\nslave-holding South should seek it, preferable to such an\r\nalternative.[634] But as the spectre of dismemberment of the nation\r\ncame nearer, concessions to the South as expressed in the Weed plan,\r\nand, later, in the Crittenden compromise, commended itself to a large\r\npart of the people. A majority of the voters at the preceding election\r\nundoubtedly favoured such an adjustment. The votes cast for Douglas,\r\nBell, and Breckenridge in the free States, with one-fourth of those\r\ncast for Lincoln, and one-fourth for Breckenridge in the slave States,\r\nmaking 2,848,792 out of a total of 4,662,170, said a writer in\r\n_Appleton's Cyclopædia_, \"were overwhelmingly in favour of\r\nconciliation, forbearance, and compromise.\"[635] Rhodes, the\r\nhistorian, approving this estimate, expresses the belief that the\r\nCrittenden compromise, if submitted to the people, would have\r\ncommanded such a vote.[636]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 634: Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 1, p. 338.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 635: _Appleton's Cyclopædia_, 1861, p. 700.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 636: James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n3, p. 261, _note_.]\r\n\r\nIn the closing months of 1860, and the opening months of 1861, this\r\nbelief dominated the Democratic party as well as a large number of\r\nconservative Republicans; but, as the winter passed without\r\nsubstantial progress toward an effective compromise, the cloud of\r\ntrouble assumed larger proportions and an alarmist spirit spread\r\nabroad. After Major Anderson, on the night of December 27, had\r\ntransferred his command from its exposed position at Fort Moultrie to\r\nthe stronger one at Fort Sumter, it was not uncommon to hear upon the\r\nstreets disloyal sentiments blended with those of willing sacrifice\r\nto maintain the Union. This condition was accentuated by the action of\r\nthe Legislature, which convened on January 2, 1861, with twenty-three\r\nRepublicans and nine Democrats in the Senate, and ninety-three\r\nRepublicans and thirty-five Democrats in the House. In his message,\r\nGovernor Morgan urged moderation and conciliation. \"Let New York,\" he\r\nsaid, \"set an example; let her oppose no barrier, but let her\r\nrepresentatives in Congress give ready support to any just and\r\nhonourable sentiment; let her stand in hostility to none, but extend\r\nthe hand of friendship to all, cordially uniting with other members of\r\nthe Confederacy in proclaiming and enforcing a determination that the\r\nConstitution shall be honoured and the Union of the States be\r\npreserved.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 7, five days after this dignified and conservative appeal,\r\nFernando Wood, imitating the example of South Carolina, advocated the\r\nsecession of the city from the State. \"Why should not New York City,\"\r\nsaid the Mayor, as if playing the part of a satirist, \"instead of\r\nsupporting by her contributions in revenue two-thirds of the expenses\r\nof the United States, become, also, equally independent? As a free\r\ncity, with a nominal duty on imports, her local government could be\r\nsupported without taxation upon her people.... Thus we could live free\r\nfrom taxes, and have cheap goods nearly duty free.... When disunion\r\nhas become a fixed and certain fact, why may not New York disrupt the\r\nbands which bind her to a venal and corrupt master--to a people and a\r\nparty that have plundered her revenues, attempted to ruin her\r\ncommerce, taken away the power of self-government, and destroyed the\r\nconfederacy of which she was the proud empire city.\"[637]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 637: Proceedings of the Board of Aldermen, LXXXI: p. 25, 26.\r\nNew York _Herald_, January 8.]\r\n\r\nBy order of a sympathising common council, this absurd message,\r\nprinted in pamphlet form, was distributed among the people. Few,\r\nhowever, took it seriously. \"Fernando Wood,\" said the _Tribune_,\r\n\"evidently wants to be a traitor; it is lack of courage only that\r\nmakes him content with being a blackguard.\"[638] The next day\r\nConfederate forts fired upon the _Star of the West_ while endeavouring\r\nto convey troops and supplies to Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 638: New York _Tribune_, January 8, 1861.]\r\n\r\nThe jar of the Mayor's message and the roar of hostile guns were\r\nquickly followed by the passage, through the Legislature, of a\r\nconcurrent resolution, tendering the President \"whatever aid in men\r\nand money may be required to enable him to enforce the laws and uphold\r\nthe authority of the Federal Government; and that, in the defence of\r\nthe Union, which has conferred prosperity and happiness upon the\r\nAmerican people, renewing the pledge given and redeemed by our\r\nfathers, we are ready to devote our fortunes, our lives, and our\r\nsacred honour.\"[639] This resolution undoubtedly expressed the\r\noverwhelming preponderance of sentiment in the State,[640] but its\r\ndefiant tone, blended with the foolish words of Wood and the menacing\r\nact of South Carolina, called forth greater efforts for compromise, to\r\nthe accomplishment of which a mammoth petition, signed by the leading\r\nbusiness men of the State, was sent to Congress, praying that\r\n\"measures, either of direct legislation or of amendment of the\r\nConstitution, may be speedily adopted, which, we are assured, will\r\nrestore peace to our agitated country.\"[641]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 639: _Appleton's Cyclopædia_, 1861, p. 700.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 640: \"The whole people in this part of the country are\r\nwaiting with impatience for your assumption of the great office to\r\nwhich the suffrage of a free people has called you, and will hail you\r\nas a deliverer from treason and anarchy. In New York City all classes\r\nand parties are rapidly uniting in this sentiment, and here in Albany,\r\nwhere I am spending a few days in attendance upon Court, the general\r\ntone of feeling and thinking about public affairs shows little\r\ndifference between Republicans and Democrats.\"--W.M. Evarts to Abraham\r\nLincoln, January 15, 1861. Unpublished letter on file in Department of\r\nState at Washington.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 641: _Appleton's Cyclopædia_, 1861, p. 520.]\r\n\r\nOn January 18, a meeting of the merchants of New York City, held in\r\nthe Chamber of Commerce, unanimously adopted a memorial, addressed to\r\nCongress, urging the acceptance of the Crittenden compromise. Similar\r\naction to maintain peace in an honourable way was taken in other\r\ncities of the State, while congressmen were daily loaded with appeals\r\nfavouring any compromise that would keep the peace. Among other\r\npetitions of this character, Elbridge G. Spaulding presented one from\r\nBuffalo, signed by Millard Fillmore, Henry W. Rogers, and three\r\nthousand others. On January 24, Governor Morgan received resolutions,\r\npassed by the General Assembly of Virginia, inviting the State,\r\nthrough its Legislature, to send commissioners to a peace conference\r\nto be held at Washington on February 4. Nothing had occurred in the\r\nintervening weeks to change the sentiment of the Legislature,\r\nexpressed earlier in the session; but, after much discussion and many\r\ndelays, it was resolved, in acceding to the request of Virginia, that\r\n\"it is not to be understood that this Legislature approves of the\r\npropositions submitted, or concedes the propriety of their adoption by\r\nthe proposed convention. But while adhering to the position she has\r\nheretofore occupied, New York will not reject an invitation to a\r\nconference, which, by bringing together the men of both sections,\r\nholds out the possibility of an honourable settlement of our national\r\ndifficulties, and the restoration of peace and harmony to the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe balloting for commissioners resulted in the election of David\r\nDudley Field, William Curtis Noyes, James S. Wadsworth, James C.\r\nSmith, Amaziah B. James, Erastus Corning, Francis Granger, Greene C.\r\nBronson, William E. Dodge, John A. King, and John E. Wool, with the\r\nproviso, however, that they were to take no part in the proceedings\r\nunless a majority of the non-slave-holding States were represented.\r\nThe appearance of Francis Granger upon the commission was the act of\r\nThurlow Weed. Granger, happy in his retirement at Canandaigua, had\r\nbeen out of office and out of politics so many years that, as he said\r\nin a letter to the editor of the _Evening Journal_, \"it is with the\r\ngreatest repugnance that I think of again appearing before the\r\npublic.\"[642] But Weed urged him, and Granger accepted \"the\r\nflattering honour.\"[643] Thus, after many years of estrangement, the\r\nleader of the Woolies clasped hands again with the chief of the\r\nSilver-Grays.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 642: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n317.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 643: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n318.]\r\n\r\nThough a trifling event in itself, the detention of thirty-eight boxes\r\nof muskets by the New York police kept the people conscious of the\r\nstrained relations between the States. The ownership of the guns, left\r\nfor shipment to Savannah, would ordinarily have been promptly settled\r\nin a local court; but the detention now became an affair of national\r\nimportance, involving the governors of two States and leading to the\r\nseizure of half a dozen merchant vessels lying peacefully at anchor in\r\nSavannah harbour. Instead of entering the courts, the consignor\r\ntelegraphed the consignees of the \"seizure,\" the consignees notified\r\nGovernor Brown of Georgia, and the Governor wired Governor Morgan of\r\nNew York, demanding their immediate release. Receiving no reply to his\r\nmessage, Brown, in retaliation, ordered the seizure of all vessels at\r\nSavannah belonging to citizens of New York. Although Governor Morgan\r\ngave the affair no attention beyond advising the vessel owners that\r\ntheir rights must be prosecuted in the United States courts, the\r\nshipment of the muskets and the release of the vessels soon closed the\r\nincident; but Brown's indecent zeal to give the episode an\r\ninternational character by forcing into notice the offensive\r\nassumption of an independent sovereignty, had much influence in\r\nhardening the \"no compromise\" attitude of many Northern people.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the men of New York who desired peace on any honourable\r\nterms, seemed to grow more earnest as the alarm in the public mind\r\nbecame more intense. South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,\r\nLouisiana, and Mississippi had now seceded, and, as a last appeal to\r\nthem, a monster and notable Union meeting, held at Cooper Institute on\r\nJanuary 28 and addressed by eminent men of all parties, designated\r\nJames T. Brady, Cornelius K. Garrison, and Appleton Oaksmith, as\r\ncommissioners to confer with delegates to the conventions of these\r\nseceding States \"in regard to measures best calculated to restore the\r\npeace and integrity of this Union.\"[644] Scarcely had the meeting\r\nadjourned, however, before John A. Dix, as secretary of the treasury,\r\nthrilled the country by his fearless and historic dispatch, \"If any\r\none attempts to haul down the American flag, shoot him on the spot.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 644: _Appleton's Cyclopædia_, 1861, p. 520.]\r\n\r\nDix had brought to the Cabinet the training of a soldier and of a\r\nwise, prudent, sagacious statesman of undaunted courage and integrity.\r\nWith the exception of his connection with the Barnburners in 1848, he\r\nhad been an exponent of the old Democratic traditions, and, next to\r\nHoratio Seymour, did more, probably, than any other man to bring about\r\na reunion of his party in 1852. Nevertheless, the Southern politicians\r\nnever forgave him. President Pierce offered him the position of\r\nsecretary of state, and then withdrew it with the promise of sending\r\nhim as minister to France; but the South again defeated him. From that\r\ntime until his appointment as postmaster of New York, following the\r\ndiscovery, in May, 1860, of Isaac V. Fowler's colossal defalcation,[645]\r\nDix had taken little part in politics. If the President, however,\r\nneeded a man of his ability and honesty in the crisis precipitated by\r\nFowler's embezzlement, such characteristics were more in demand, in\r\nJanuary, 1861, at the treasury, when the government was compelled to\r\npay twelve per cent. for a loan of five millions, while New York State\r\nsevens were taken at an average of 101-1/4.[646] Bankers refused\r\nlonger to furnish money until the Cabinet contained men upon whom the\r\nfriends of the government and the Union could rely, and Buchanan,\r\nyielding to the inevitable, appointed the man clearly indicated by the\r\nfinanciers.[647]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 645: Fowler, who was appointed postmaster of New York by\r\nPresident Pierce, began a system of embezzlements in 1855, which\r\namounted, at the time of his removal, to $155,000.--Report of\r\nPostmaster-General Holt, _Senate Document_, 36th Congress, 1st\r\nSession, XI., 48. \"In one year Fowler's bill at the New York Hotel,\r\nwhich he made the Democratic headquarters, amounted to $25,000. His\r\nbrother, John Walker Fowler, clerk to Surrogate Tucker, subsequently\r\nabsconded with $31,079, belonging to orphans and others.\"--Gustavus\r\nMyers, _History of Tammany Hall_, pp. 232, 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 646: John Jay Knox, _United States Notes_, p. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 647: New York _Evening Post_, December 26, 1860.\r\n\r\n\"On Tuesday, January 8, my father received a dispatch from the\r\nPresident to come at once to the White House. He went immediately and\r\nwas offered the War Department. This he declined, informing Mr.\r\nBuchanan, as had been agreed upon, that at that moment he could be of\r\nno service to him in any position except that of the Treasury\r\nDepartment, and that he would accept no other post. The President\r\nasked for time. The following day he had Mr. Philip Thomas's\r\nresignation in his hand, and sent General Dix's name to the Senate. It\r\nwas instantly confirmed.\"--Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol.\r\n1, p. 362.]\r\n\r\nAlthough now sixty-three years old, with the energy and pluck of his\r\nsoldier days, Dix had no ambition to be in advance of his party. He\r\nfavoured the Crittenden compromise, advocated Southern rights under\r\nthe limits of the Constitution, and wrote to leaders in the South with\r\nthe familiarity of an old friend. \"I recall occasions,\" wrote his son,\r\n\"when my father spoke to me on the questions of the day, disclosing\r\nthe grave trouble that possessed his thoughts. On one such occasion he\r\nreferred to the possibility that New York might become a free city,\r\nentirely independent, in case of a general breakup;[648] not that he\r\nadvocated the idea, but he placed it in the category of possibilities.\r\nIt was his opinion that a separation, if sought by the South through\r\npeaceful means alone, must be conceded by the North, as an evil less\r\nthan that of war.... Above all else, however, next to God, he loved\r\nthe country and the flag. He did everything in his power to avert the\r\nfinal catastrophe. But when the question was reduced to that simple,\r\nlucid proposition presented by the leaders of secession, he had but\r\none answer, and gave it with an emphasis and in words which were as\r\nlightning coming out of the east and shining even unto the west.\"[649]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 648: The plan advocated by Fernando Wood in his annual\r\nmessage to the Common Council, referred to on p. 348.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 649: Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 1, pp. 336,\r\n343.]\r\n\r\nFrom the day of his appointment to the Treasury to the end of the\r\nAdministration, Dix resided at the White House as the guest of the\r\nPresident, and under his influence, coupled with that of Black, Holt,\r\nand Stanton, Buchanan assumed a more positive tone in dealing with\r\nsecession. Heretofore, with the exception of Major Anderson's\r\nmovements at Fort Sumter, and Lieutenant Slemmer's daring act at Fort\r\nPickens, the seizure of federal property had gone on without\r\nopposition or much noise; but now, at last, a prominent New Yorker,\r\nwell known to every public man in the State, had flashed a patriotic\r\norder into the heart of the Southern Confederacy, startling the\r\ncountry into a realising sense of the likelihood of civil war.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this excitement, a state convention, called by the\r\nDemocratic state committee and composed of four delegates from each\r\nassembly district, representing the party of Douglas, of Breckenridge,\r\nand of Bell and Everett, assembled at Albany on January 31. Tweddle\r\nHall was scarcely large enough to contain those who longed to be\r\npresent at this peace conference. Of the prominent public men of the\r\nCommonwealth belonging to the three parties, the major part seemed to\r\nmake up the assemblage, which Greeley pronounced \"the strongest and\r\nmost imposing ever convened within the State.\"[650] On the platform\r\nsat Horatio Seymour, Amasa J. Parker, and William Kelley, the Softs'\r\nrecent candidate for governor, while half a hundred men flanked them\r\non either side, who had been chosen to seats in Congress, in the\r\nLegislature, and to other places of honour. \"No convention which had\r\nnominations to make, or patronage to dispose of, was ever so\r\ninfluentially constituted.\"[651]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 650: Horace Greeley, _The American Conflict_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n388.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 651: _Ibid._, p. 388.]\r\n\r\nSanford E. Church of Albion became temporary chairman, and Amasa J.\r\nParker, president. Parker had passed his day of running for office,\r\nbut, still in the prime of life, only fifty-four years old, his\r\nabilities ran with swiftness along many channels of industry. In\r\nstating the object of the convention, the vociferous applause which\r\ngreeted his declaration that the people of the State, demanding a\r\npeaceful settlement of the questions leading to disunion, have a right\r\nto insist upon conciliation and compromise, disclosed the almost\r\nunanimous sentiment of the meeting; but the after-discussion developed\r\ndifferences that anticipated the disruption that was to come to the\r\nDemocratic party three months later. One speaker justified Southern\r\nsecession by urgent considerations of necessity and safety; another\r\nscouted the idea of coercing a seceding State; to a third, peaceful\r\nseparation, though painful and humiliating, seemed the only safe and\r\nhonourable way. Reuben H. Walworth, the venerable ex-chancellor,\r\ndeclared that civil war, instead of restoring the Union, would forever\r\ndefeat its reconstruction. \"It would be as brutal,\" he said, \"to send\r\nmen to butcher our own brethren of the Southern States, as it would be\r\nto massacre them in the Northern States.\"\r\n\r\nHoratio Seymour received the heartiest greeting. Whether for good or\r\nevil, according to the standards by which his critics may judge him,\r\nhe swayed the minds of his party to a degree that was unequalled among\r\nhis contemporaries. For ten years his name had been the most\r\nintimately associated with party policies, and his influence the most\r\npotent. The exciting events of the past three months, with six States\r\nout of the Union and revolution already begun, had profoundly stirred\r\nhim. He had followed the proceedings of Congress, he had studied the\r\ndisposition of the South, he understood the sentiment in the North,\r\nand his appeal for a compromise, without committing himself to some of\r\nthe extravagances which were poured forth in absolute good faith by\r\nWalworth, earned him enthusiastic commendation from friends and\r\nadmirers. \"The question is simply this,\" he said; \"Shall we have\r\ncompromise _after_ war, or compromise _without_ war?\" He eulogised the\r\nvalour of the South, he declared a blockade of its extended sea coast\r\nnearly impossible, he hinted that successful coercion by the North\r\nmight not be less revolutionary than successful secession by the\r\nSouth, he predicted the ruin of Northern industries, and he scolded\r\nCongress, urging upon it a compromise--not to pacify seceding States,\r\nbut to save border States. \"The cry of 'No compromise' is false in\r\nmorals,\" he declared; \"it is treason to the spirit of the\r\nConstitution; it is infidelity in religion; the cross itself is a\r\ncompromise, and is pleaded by many who refuse all charity to their\r\nfellow-citizens. It is the vital principle of social existence; it\r\nunites the family circle; it sustains the church, and upholds\r\nnationalities.... But the Republicans complain that, having won a\r\nvictory, we ask them to surrender its fruits. We do not wish them to\r\ngive up any political advantage. We urge measures which are demanded\r\nby the hour and the safety of our Union. Are they making sacrifices,\r\nwhen they do that which is required by the common welfare?\"[652]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 652: Albany _Argus_, February 1, 1861.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Russell, correspondent of the London _Times_, who dined\r\nwith Horatio Seymour, Samuel J. Tilden and George Bancroft, wrote that\r\n\"the result left on my mind by their conversation and arguments was\r\nthat, according to the Constitution, the government could not employ\r\nforce to prevent secession, or to compel States which had seceded by\r\nthe will of the people to acknowledge the federal power.\"--Entry March\r\n17, _Diary_, p. 20.]\r\n\r\nIt remained for George W. Clinton of Buffalo, the son of the\r\nillustrious DeWitt Clinton, to lift the meeting to the higher plane of\r\ngenuine loyalty to the Union. Clinton was a Hard in politics. He had\r\nstood with John A. Dix and Daniel S. Dickinson, had been defeated for\r\nlieutenant-governor on their ticket, and had supported Breckenridge;\r\nbut when the fateful moment arrived at which a decision had to be made\r\nfor or against the country, his genius, like the prescience of Dix,\r\nguided him rightly. \"Let us conciliate our erring brethren,\" he said,\r\n\"who, under a strange delusion, have, as they say, seceded from us;\r\nbut, for God's sake, do not let us humble the glorious government\r\nunder which we have been so happy and which will yet do so much for\r\nthe happiness of mankind. Gentlemen, I hate to use a word that will\r\noffend my Southern brother, but we have reached a time when, as a\r\nman--if you please, as a Democrat--I must use plain terms. There is no\r\nsuch thing as legal secession. The Constitution of these United States\r\nwas intended to form a firm and perpetual Union. If secession be not\r\nlawful, then, what is it? I use the term reluctantly but truly--it is\r\nrebellion! rebellion against the noblest government man ever framed\r\nfor his own benefit and for the benefit of the world. What is it--this\r\nsecession? I am not speaking of the men. I love the men, but I hate\r\ntreason. What is it but nullification by the wholesale? I have\r\nvenerated Andrew Jackson, and my blood boiled, in old time, when that\r\nbrave patriot and soldier of Democracy said--'the Union, it must and\r\nshall be preserved.' (Loud applause.) Preserve it? Why should we\r\npreserve it, if it would be the thing these gentlemen would make it?\r\nWhy should we love a government that has no dignity and no power? Look\r\nat it for a moment. Congress, for just cause, declares war, but one\r\nState says, 'War is not for me--I secede.' And so another and another,\r\nand the government is rendered powerless. I am not prepared to humble\r\nthe general government at the feet of the seceding States. I am\r\nunwilling to say to the government, 'You must abandon your property,\r\nyou must cease to collect the revenues, because you are threatened.'\r\nIn other words, gentlemen, it seems to me--and I know I speak the\r\nwishes of my constituents--that, while I abhor coercion, in one sense,\r\nas war, I wish to preserve the dignity of the government of these\r\nUnited States as well.\"[653]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 653: Horace Greeley, _The American Conflict_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n394.\r\n\r\n\"When rebellion actually began many loyal Democrats came nobly out and\r\nplanted themselves by the side of the country. But those who clung to\r\nthe party organisation, what did they do? A month before Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas inaugurated they held a state convention for the Democratic party\r\nof the State of New York. It was said it was to save the country,--it\r\nwas whispered it was to save the party. The state committee called it\r\nand representative men gathered to attend it.... They applauded to the\r\necho the very blasphemy of treason, but they attempted by points of\r\norder to silence DeWitt Clinton's son because he dared to raise his\r\nvoice for the Constitution of his country and to call rebellion by its\r\nproper name.\"--Speech of Roscoe Conkling, September 26, 1862, A.R.\r\nConkling, _Life and Letters of Roscoe Conkling_, p. 180.]\r\n\r\nThe applause that greeted these loyal sentences disclosed a patriotic\r\nsentiment, which, until then, had found no opportunity for expression;\r\nyet the convention, in adopting a series of resolutions, was of one\r\nmind on the question of submitting the Crittenden compromise to a\r\ndirect vote of the people. \"Their voice,\" said the chairman, \"will be\r\nomnipresent here, and if it be raised in time it may be effectual\r\nelsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nThere is something almost pathetic in the history of these efforts\r\nwhich were made during the progress of secession, to avert, if\r\npossible, the coming shock. The great peace conference, assembled by\r\nthe action of Virginia, belongs to these painful and wasted\r\nendeavours. On February 4, the day that delegates from six cotton\r\nStates assembled at Montgomery to form a Southern confederacy, one\r\nhundred and thirty-three commissioners, representing twenty-one\r\nStates, of which fourteen were non-slave-holding, met at Washington\r\nand continued in session, sitting with closed doors, until the 27th.\r\nIt was a body of great dignity--a \"fossil convention,\" the _Tribune_\r\ncalled it--whose proceedings, because of the desire in the public mind\r\nto avoid civil war, attracted wide attention. David Dudley Field\r\nrepresented New York on the committee on resolutions, which proposed\r\nan amendment of seven sections to the Constitution. On February 26,\r\nthese were taken up in their order for passage. The first section\r\nprovided for the restoration of the Missouri Compromise line under the\r\nthen existing conditions, provided that whenever a new State was\r\nformed north or south of that line it should be admitted with or\r\nwithout slavery, as its constitution might declare. This was the\r\nimportant concession; but, though it was less favourable to the South\r\nthan the Crittenden compromise, it failed to satisfy the radical\r\nRepublicans, who had from the first opposed the convention.\r\nAccordingly, the vote, taken by States, stood eight to eleven against\r\nit, New York being included among the noes. The next morning,\r\nhowever, after agreeing to a reconsideration of the question, the\r\nconvention passed the section by a vote of nine to eight, New York,\r\ndivided by the absence of David Dudley Field, being without a voice in\r\nits determination. Field never fully recovered from this apparent\r\nbreach of trust.[654] In committee, he had earnestly opposed the\r\nproposed amendment, talking almost incessantly for three weeks, but,\r\nat the supreme moment, when the report came up for passage, he\r\nwithdrew from the convention, without explanation, thus depriving his\r\nState of a vote upon all the sections save one, because of an evenly\r\ndivided delegation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 654: See New York _Tribune_, March 23, 1861, for Field's\r\nstatement in defence of his action. Also _Tribune_, March 7, for John\r\nA. King's charges.]\r\n\r\nThe convention, however, was doomed to failure before Field left it.\r\nVery early in its life the eloquent New Yorker, assisting to rob it of\r\nany power for good, declared his opposition to any amendment to the\r\nConstitution. \"The Union,\" he said, \"is indissoluble, and no State can\r\nsecede. I will lay down my life for it.... We must have the\r\narbitration of reason, or the arbitrament of the sword.\" Amaziah B.\r\nJames, another New Yorker, possessed the same plainness of speech.\r\n\"The North will not enter upon war until the South forces it to do\r\nso,\" he said, mildly. \"But when you begin it, the government will\r\ncarry it on until the Union is restored and its enemies put\r\ndown.\"[655] If any stronger Union sentiment were needed, the remarks\r\nof Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, in disclosing the attitude of his party,\r\nsupplied it. \"The election of Lincoln,\" he said, \"must be regarded as\r\nthe triumph of principles cherished in the hearts of the people of the\r\nfree States. Chief among these principles is the restriction of\r\nslavery within State limits; not war upon slavery within those limits,\r\nbut fixed opposition to its extension beyond them. By a fair and\r\nunquestionable majority we have secured that triumph. Do you think\r\nwe, who represent this majority, will throw it away? Do you think the\r\npeople would sustain us if we undertook to throw it away?\"[656]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 655: Lucius E. Chittenden, _Report of Proceedings of Peace\r\nConference_, pp. 157, 170, 303, 428.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 656: Lucius E. Chittenden, _Report of Proceedings of Peace\r\nConference_, p. 304.]\r\n\r\nAfter three weeks of such talk, even Virginia, whose share in forming\r\nthe Union exceeded that of any other State, manifested its\r\ndiscouragement by repudiating the proposed amendment as an\r\ninsufficient guarantee for bringing back the cotton States or holding\r\nthe border States. When, finally, on March 4, the result of the\r\nconference was offered in the United States Senate, only seven votes\r\nwere cast in its favour. So faded and died the last great effort for\r\ncompromise and peace. For months it must have been apparent to every\r\none that the party of Lincoln would not yield the cornerstone of its\r\nprinciples. It desired peace, was quick to co-operate, and ready to\r\nconciliate, but its purpose to preserve free territory for free labour\r\nremained fixed and unalterable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nWEED'S REVENGE UPON GREELEY\r\n\r\n1861\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1860-61, while the country was drifting into civil\r\nwar, a desperate struggle was going on at Albany to elect a United\r\nStates senator in place of William H. Seward, whose term expired on\r\nthe fourth of March. After the defeat of the Senator at Chicago,\r\nsentiment settled upon his return to Washington; but when Lincoln\r\noffered him the position of secretary of state, Thurlow Weed announced\r\nWilliam M. Evarts as his candidate for the United States Senate.\r\nEvarts was now forty-three years of age. Born in Boston, a graduate of\r\nYale, and of the Harvard law school, he had been a successful lawyer\r\nat the New York bar for twenty years. Union College had conferred upon\r\nhim, in 1857, the degree of Doctor of Laws, and the rare ability and\r\nmarvellous persistence manifested in the Lemmon slave case, in which\r\nhe was opposed by Charles O'Conor, had given abundant evidence of the\r\ngreat intellectual powers that subsequently distinguished him. He had,\r\nalso, other claims to recognition. The wit and great learning that\r\nmade him the most charming of conversationalists increased his\r\npopularity, while his love of books, his excellent taste, and good\r\nmanners made him welcome in the club and the social circle. Indeed, he\r\nseems to have possessed almost every gift and grace that nature and\r\nfortune could bestow, giving him high place among his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nEvarts had not then held office. The places that O'Conor and Brady had\r\naccepted presented no attractions for him; nor did he seem to desire\r\nthe varied political careers that had distinguished other brilliant\r\nyoung members of the New York bar. But he had taken pleasure in\r\nbringing to his party a wisdom in council which was only equalled by\r\nhis power in debate. If this service were insufficient to establish\r\nhis right to the exalted preferment he now sought, his recent valuable\r\nwork at the Chicago convention was enough to satisfy Thurlow Weed, at\r\nleast, that generous assistance of such surpassing value should be\r\nrichly rewarded.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, Weed's authority in his party in the State had been\r\nsupreme. He failed to have his way in 1846 when John Young seized the\r\nnomination for governor, and some confusion existed as to his\r\ninfluence in the convention that selected Myron Clark in 1854; but for\r\nall practical purposes Weed had controlled the Whig and Republican\r\nparties since their formation, almost without dissent. Circumstances\r\nsometimes favoured him. The hard times of 1837 made possible Seward's\r\nelection as governor; the split in the Democratic party over the\r\ncanal, and later over the Wilmot Proviso, secured Seward a seat in the\r\nUnited States Senate; and the sudden and wholly unexpected repeal of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise defeated the Silver-Grays and aided in rapidly\r\nreducing the strength of the Know-Nothings; but these changes in the\r\npolitical situation, although letting Weed's party into power,\r\nburdened his leadership with serious problems. It required a master\r\nhand safely to guide a party between the Radical and Abolition\r\nfactions on one side and the Conservatives on the other, and his\r\nsignal success commended him to President Lincoln, who frequently\r\ncounselled with him, often inviting him to Washington by telegram\r\nduring the darkest days of civil war.\r\n\r\nBut the defection of Greeley, supplemented by William Cullen Bryant\r\nand the union of radical leaders who came from the Democratic party,\r\nfinally blossomed into successful rebellion at Chicago. This\r\nencouraged Greeley to lead one at Albany. The Legislature had one\r\nhundred and sixteen Republican members, requiring fifty-nine to\r\nnominate in caucus. Evarts could count on forty-two and Greeley upon\r\nabout as many. In his effort to secure the remaining seventeen, Weed\r\ndiscovered that Ira Harris had a considerable following, who were\r\nindisposed to affiliate with Evarts, while several assemblymen\r\nindicated a preference for other candidates. This precipitated a\r\nbattle royal. Greeley did not personally appear in Albany, but he\r\nscorned none of the ordinary crafts of party management. Charles A.\r\nDana, then of the _Tribune_, represented him, and local leaders from\r\nvarious parts of the State rallied to his standard and industriously\r\nprosecuted his canvass. Their slogan was \"down with the Dictator.\" It\r\nmattered not that they had approved Weed's management in the past,\r\ntheir fight now proposed to end the one-man power, and every\r\nplace-hunter who could not secure patronage under Lincoln's\r\nadministration if Evarts went to the Senate, ranged himself against\r\nWeed. On the side of the _Tribune's_ editor, also, stood the\r\nindependent, whose dislike of a party boss always encourages him to\r\nstrike whenever the way is open to deal an effective blow. This was\r\nGreeley's great strength. It marshalled itself.\r\n\r\nWeed summoned all his hosts. Moses H. Grinnell, Simeon Draper, and A.\r\nOakey Hall led the charge, flanked by a cloud of state and county\r\nofficials, and an army of politicians who filled the hotels and\r\ncrowded the lobbies of the capitol. The _Tribune_ estimated Evarts'\r\nbackers at not less than one thousand.[657] For two weeks the battle\r\nraged with all the characteristics of an intense personal conflict.\r\nGreeley declared it \"a conflict which was to determine whether a\r\ndynasty was to stand and give law to its subjects, or be overthrown\r\nand annihilated. Fully appreciating this, not Richmond at Bosworth\r\nField, Charles at Naseby, nor Napoleon at Waterloo made a more\r\ndesperate fight for empire than did the one-man power at Albany to\r\nretain the sceptre it has wielded for so many years over the politics\r\nand placemen of this State.\"[658] In their desperation both sides\r\nappealed to the President-elect, who refused to be drawn into the\r\nstruggle. \"Justice to all\" was his answer to Weed. \"I have said\r\nnothing more particular to any one.\"[659]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 657: New York _Tribune_, February 5, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 658: _Ibid._, February 5, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 659: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n324.]\r\n\r\nAs the canvass grew older, it became known that several of Harris'\r\nsupporters would go to Greeley whenever their assistance would\r\nnominate him. This sacrifice, however, was not to be made so long as\r\nHarris held the balance of power; and since Weed's desire to defeat\r\nGreeley was well understood, Harris counted with some degree of\r\ncertainty upon Evarts' supporters whenever a serious break threatened.\r\nWeed's relations with Harris were not cordial. For years they had\r\nlived in Albany, and as early as 1846 their ways began to diverge; but\r\nHarris' character for wisdom, learning, and integrity compelled\r\nrespect. He had been an assemblyman in 1844 and 1845, a state senator\r\nin 1846, a delegate to the constitutional convention of 1846, and a\r\njustice of the Supreme Court from 1847 to 1859. His name was familiar\r\nthroughout the State. From the time he took up the cause of the\r\nAnti-Renters in 1846 he had possessed the confidence of the common\r\npeople, and his great fairness and courtesy upon the bench had added\r\nlargely to his reputation. He was without any pretence to oratory. The\r\ngifts that made Evarts a leader of the New York bar for three decades\r\ndid not belong to him; but everybody knew that in the United States\r\nSenate he would do as much as Evarts to uphold President Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe caucus convened on the evening of February 4. Only one member was\r\nabsent. Weed and Evarts sat with Governor Morgan in the executive\r\nchamber--Harris in the rooms of Lieutenant-Governor Campbell at\r\nCongress Hall. The first ballot gave Evarts 42, Greeley 40, Harris 20,\r\nwith 13 scattering. Bets had been made that Evarts would get 50, and\r\nsome over-sanguine ones fixed it at 60. What Weed expected does not\r\nappear; but the second ballot, which reduced Evarts to 39 and raised\r\nGreeley to 42, did not please Speaker Littlejohn, who carried orders\r\nbetween the executive and assembly chambers. It seemed to doom Evarts\r\nto ultimate defeat. The chamber grew dark with the gloomy frowns of\r\nmen who had failed to move their stubborn representatives. The next\r\nfour ballots, quickly taken, showed little progress, but the seventh\r\nraised Greeley to 47 and dropped Harris to 19, while Evarts held on at\r\n39. An assurance that the object of their labours would be reached\r\nwith the assistance of some of Harris' votes on the next ballot, made\r\nthe friends of Greeley jubilant. It was equally apparent to the\r\nastonished followers of the grim manager who was smoking vehemently in\r\nthe executive chamber, that Evarts would be unable to weather another\r\nballot. A crisis, therefore, was inevitable, but it was the crisis for\r\nwhich Weed had been waiting and watching, and without hesitation he\r\nsent word to elect Harris.[660] This settled it. Greeley received 49,\r\nHarris 60, with 6 scattering. Weed did not get all he wanted, but he\r\ngot revenge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 660: \"Pale as ashes, Weed sat smoking a cigar within earshot\r\nof the bustle in the crowded assembly room where the caucus sat.\r\nLittlejohn stalked over the heads of the spectators and reported to\r\nWeed. Unmindful of the fact that he had a cigar in his mouth, Weed\r\nlighted another and put it in, then rose in great excitement and said\r\nto Littlejohn, 'Tell the Evarts men to go right over to Harris--to\r\n_Harris_--to HARRIS!' The order was given in the caucus. They wheeled\r\ninto line like Napoleon's Old Guard, and Harris was nominated.\"--H.B.\r\nStanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 218.]\r\n\r\nThere were reasons other than revenge, however, that induced men\r\nvigorously opposed to secession to resent the candidacy of Horace\r\nGreeley.[661] The editor of the _Tribune_ certainly did not want the\r\nSouthern States to secede, nor did he favour secession, as has often\r\nbeen charged, but his peculiar treatment of the question immediately\r\nafter the November election gave the would-be secessionists comfort,\r\nif it did not absolutely invite and encourage the South to believe in\r\nthe possibility of peaceable secession.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 661: \"It is quite possible that the _Tribune's_ articles of\r\nNovember, 1860, cost Greeley the senatorship.\"--James F. Rhodes,\r\n_History of the United States_, Vol. 3, p. 142.]\r\n\r\nGreeley seems to have taken failure with apparent serenity. He\r\nprofessed to regard it as the downfall of Weed rather than the defeat\r\nof himself. His friends who knew of the antagonistic relations long\r\nexisting between Harris and Weed, said the _Tribune_, exultingly, were\r\nwilling to see Harris nominated, since \"he would become an agent for\r\nthe accomplishment of their main purpose--the overthrow of the\r\ndictatorship, and the establishment upon its ruins of the principle of\r\npolitical independence in thought and action.\"[662] But whatever its\r\ninfluence upon Weed, the nomination of Harris was a bitter\r\ndisappointment to Greeley. He was extraordinarily ambitious for public\r\npreferment. The character or duties of the office seemed to make\r\nlittle difference to him. Congressman, senator, governor,\r\nlieutenant-governor, comptroller of state, and President of the United\r\nStates, at one time or another greatly attracted him, and to gain any\r\none of them he willingly lent his name or gave up his time; but never\r\ndid he come so near reaching the goal of his ambition as in February,\r\n1861. The promise of Harris' supporters to transfer their votes\r\nencouraged a confidence that was not misplaced. The Greeley men were\r\nelated, the more ardent entertaining no doubt that the eighth ballot\r\nwould bring victory; and, had Weed delayed a moment longer, Greeley\r\nmust have been a United States senator. But Weed did not delay, and\r\nGreeley closed his life with an office-holding record of ninety days\r\nin Congress. Like George Borrow, he seemed never to realise that his\r\nsimple, clear, vigorous English was to be the crown of an undying\r\nfame.[663]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 662: New York _Tribune_, February 5, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 663: \"It is one of the curiosities of human nature that\r\nGreeley, who exceeded in influence many of our Presidents, should have\r\nhankered so constantly for office. It is strange enough that the man\r\nwho wrote as a dictator of public opinion in the _Tribune_ on the 9th\r\nof November could write two days later the letter to Seward,\r\ndissolving the political firm of Seward, Weed, and Greeley. In that\r\nletter the petulance of the office-seeker is shown, and the grievous\r\ndisappointment that he did not get the nomination for lieutenant-governor,\r\nwhich went to Raymond, stands out plainly.\"--James F. Rhodes, _History\r\nof the United States_, Vol. 2, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nLINCOLN, SEWARD, AND THE UNION\r\n\r\n1860-1861\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the day approached for the opening of Congress on Monday, December\r\n3, 1860, William H. Seward left Auburn for Washington. At this time he\r\npossessed the most powerful influence of any one in the Republican\r\nparty. While other leaders, his rivals in eloquence and his peers in\r\nability, exercised great authority, the wisdom of no one was more\r\nwidely appreciated, or more frequently drawn upon. \"Sumner, Trumbull,\r\nand Wade,\" says McClure, speaking from personal acquaintance, \"had\r\nintellectual force, but Trumbull was a judge rather than a politician,\r\nWade was oppressively blunt, and Sumner cultivated an ideal\r\nstatesmanship that placed him outside the line of practical politics.\r\nFessenden was more nearly a copy of Seward in temperament and\r\ndiscretion, but readily conceded the masterly ability of his\r\ncolleague. Seward was not magnetic like Clay or Blaine, but he knew\r\nhow to make all welcome who came within range of his presence.\"[664]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 664: Alex. K. McClure, _Recollections of Half a Century_,\r\npp. 213, 214.]\r\n\r\nThus far, since the election, Seward had remained silent upon the\r\nissues that now began to disturb the nation. Writing to Thurlow Weed\r\non November 18, 1860, he declared he was \"without schemes or plans,\r\nhopes, desires, or fears for the future, that need trouble anybody so\r\nfar as I am concerned.\"[665] Nevertheless, he had scarcely reached the\r\ncapital before he discovered that he was charged with being the author\r\nof Weed's compromise policy. \"Here's a muss,\" he wrote, on December\r\n3. \"Republican members stopped at the _Tribune_ office on their way,\r\nand when they all lamented your articles, Dana told them they were not\r\nyours but mine; that I 'wanted to make a great compromise like Clay\r\nand Webster.'\"[666]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 665: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 478.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 666: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n308.]\r\n\r\nTo Republicans it did not seem possible that Weed's plan of\r\nconciliation, so carefully and ably presented, could be published\r\nwithout the assistance, or, at least, the approval of his warm\r\npersonal and political friend,--an impression that gained readier\r\ncredence because of the prompt acquiescence of the New York _Times_\r\nand the _Courier_. Seward, however, quickly punctured Charles A.\r\nDana's misinformation, and continued to keep his own counsels. \"I talk\r\nvery little, and nothing in detail,\" he wrote his wife, on December 2;\r\n\"but I am engaged busily in studying and gathering my thoughts for the\r\nUnion.\"[667] To Weed, on the same day, he gave the political\r\nsituation. \"South Carolina is committed. Georgia will debate, but she\r\nprobably follows South Carolina. Mississippi and Alabama likely to\r\nfollow.... Members are coming in, all in confusion. Nothing can be\r\nagreed on in advance, but silence for the present, which I have\r\ninsisted must not be _sullen_, as last year, but respectful and\r\nfraternal.\"[668]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 667: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H.

But it\r\nfailed of its purpose. \"Its real object,\" he wrote Weed, \"was to find\r\nout whether I authorised the _Evening Journal_, _Times_, and _Courier_\r\narticles. I told them they would know what I think and what I propose\r\nwhen I do myself. The Republican party to-day is as uncompromising as\r\nthe secessionists in South Carolina. A month hence each may come to\r\nthink that moderation is wiser.\"[669]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 669: _Ibid._, Vol. 2, p. 308.]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to determine from his correspondence just what was in\r\nSeward's mind from the first to the thirteenth of December, but it is\r\nplain that he was greatly disturbed. Nothing seemed to please him.\r\nWeed's articles perplexed[670] him; his colleagues distrusted[671]\r\nhim; the debates in the Senate were hasty and feeble;[672] few had any\r\ncourage or confidence in the Union;[673] and the action of the Sumner\r\nradicals annoyed him.[674] Rhodes, the historian, says he was\r\nwavering.[675] He was certainly waiting,--probably to hear from\r\nLincoln; but while he waited his epigrammatic criticism of Buchanan's\r\nmessage, which he wrote his wife on December 5, got into the\r\nnewspapers and struck a popular note. \"The message shows\r\nconclusively,\" he said, \"that it is the duty of the President to\r\nexecute the laws--unless somebody opposes him; and that no State has a\r\nright to go out of the Union--unless it wants to.\"[676]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 670: \"Weed's articles have brought perplexities about me\r\nwhich he, with all his astuteness, did not foresee.\"--F.W.

Rhodes, _History of the United\r\nStates_, Vol. 3, p. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 676: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 480.]\r\n\r\nOn December 13 Seward received the desired letter from the\r\nPresident-elect, formally tendering him the office of secretary of\r\nstate. The proffer was not unexpected. Press and politicians had\r\npredicted it and conceded its propriety. \"From the day of my\r\nnomination at Chicago,\" Lincoln said, in an informal and confidential\r\nletter of the same day, \"it has been my purpose to assign you, by your\r\nleave, this place in the Administration. I have delayed so long to\r\ncommunicate that purpose, in deference to what appeared to me a proper\r\ncaution in the case. Nothing has been developed to change my view in\r\nthe premises; and I now offer you the place in the hope that you will\r\naccept it, and with the belief that your position in the public eye,\r\nyour integrity, ability, learning, and great experience all combine to\r\nrender it an appointment pre-eminently fit to be made.\"[677]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 677: Nicolay and Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 3, p. 349.]\r\n\r\nIn the recent campaign Seward had attracted such attention and aroused\r\nsuch enthusiasm, that James Russell Lowell thought his magnanimity,\r\nsince the result of the convention was known, \"a greater ornament to\r\nhim and a greater honour to his party than his election to the\r\nPresidency would have been.\"[678] Seward's friends had followed his\r\nexample. \"We all feel that New York and the friends of Seward have\r\nacted nobly,\" wrote Leonard Swett to Weed.[679] A month after the\r\noffer of the portfolio had been made, Lincoln wrote Seward that \"your\r\nselection for the state department having become public, I am happy to\r\nfind scarcely any objection to it. I shall have trouble with every\r\nother cabinet appointment--so much so, that I shall have to defer them\r\nas long as possible, to avoid being teased into insanity, to make\r\nchanges.\"[680]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 678: _Atlantic Monthly_, October, 1860; _Lowell's Political\r\nEssays_, p. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 679: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n301.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 680: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 493.]\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Seward had thought the post of minister, or even secretary of\r\nstate, without temptations for him, but, in 1860, amidst the gathering\r\nclouds of a grave crisis, the championship of the Union in a great\r\npolitical arena seemed to appeal, in an exceptional degree, to his\r\ndesire to help guide the destinies of his country; and, after\r\ncounselling with Weed at Albany, and with his wife at Auburn, he wrote\r\nthe President-elect that he thought it his duty to accept the\r\nappointment.[681] Between the time of its tender and of its acceptance\r\nSeward had gained a clear understanding of Lincoln's views; for, after\r\nhis conference with Weed, the latter visited Springfield and obtained\r\na written statement from the President-elect. This statement has never\r\nappeared in print, but it practically embodied the sentiment written\r\nKellogg and Washburn, and which was received by them after Seward left\r\nWashington for Auburn.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 681: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, pp. 481,\r\n487.]\r\n\r\nWith this information the Senator returned to the capital, stopping\r\nover night at the Astor House in New York, where he unexpectedly found\r\nthe New England Society celebrating Forefathers' Day. The knowledge of\r\nhis arrival quickly reached the banqueters. They knew that Weed had\r\nseen Lincoln, and that, to hear the tidings from Springfield, Seward\r\nhad travelled with his friend from Syracuse to Albany. Eagerly,\r\ntherefore, they pressed him for a speech, for words spoken by the man\r\nwho would occupy the first place in Lincoln's Cabinet, meant to the\r\nbusiness men of the great metropolis, distracted by the disturbed\r\nconditions growing out of the disunion movement, words of national\r\nsalvation. Seward never spoke from impulse. He understood the value of\r\nsilence and the necessity of thought before utterance. All of his many\r\ngreat speeches were prepared in a most painstaking manner. But, as\r\nmany members of the society were personal or political friends, he\r\nconsented to address them, talking briefly and with characteristic\r\noptimism, though without disclosing Lincoln's position or his own on\r\nthe question of compromise. \"I know that the necessities which created\r\nthis Union,\" he said, in closing, \"are stronger to-day than they were\r\nwhen the Union was cemented; and that these necessities are as\r\nenduring as the passions of men are short-lived and effervescent. I\r\nbelieve that the cause of secession was as strong, on the night of\r\nNovember 6, when the President and Vice President were elected, as it\r\nhas been at any time. Some fifty days have now passed; and I believe\r\nthat every day the sun has set since that time, it has set upon\r\nmollified passions and prejudices; and if you will only await the\r\ntime, sixty more suns will shed a light and illuminate a more cheerful\r\natmosphere.\"[682]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 682: New York _Times_, December 24, 1860.]\r\n\r\nThis speech has been severely criticised for its unseemly jest, its\r\nexuberant optimism, and its lack of directness. It probably discloses,\r\nin the copy published the next morning, more levity than it seemed to\r\npossess when spoken, with its inflections and intonations, while its\r\noptimism, made up of hopeful generalities which were not true, and of\r\nrhetorical phrases that could easily be misapprehended, appeared to\r\nsustain the suggestion that he did not realise the critical juncture\r\nof affairs. But the assertion that he predicted the \"war will be over\r\nin sixty days\" was a ridiculous perversion of his words. No war\r\nexisted at that time, and his \"sixty suns\" plainly referred to the\r\nsixty days that must elapse before Lincoln's inauguration.\r\nNevertheless, the \"sixty days prediction,\" as it was called, was\r\nrepeated and believed for many years.\r\n\r\nThe feature of the speech that makes it peculiarly interesting,\r\nhowever, is its strength in the advocacy of the Union. Seward believed\r\nthat he had a difficult role to play. Had he so desired he could not\r\nsupport the restoration of the Missouri Compromise line, for the\r\nPresident-elect had ruled inflexibly against it; neither could he\r\nopenly oppose it, lest it hurry the South into some overt act of\r\ntreason before Lincoln's inauguration. So he began exalting the Union,\r\nskilfully creating the impression, at least by inference, that he\r\nwould not support the compromise, although his hearers and readers\r\nheld to the belief that he would have favoured it had he not submitted\r\nto Lincoln's leadership by accepting the state department.\r\n\r\nDuring Seward's absence from Washington he was placed upon the Senate\r\ncommittee of thirteen to consider the Crittenden compromise. It was\r\nadmitted that the restoration of the Missouri line was the nub of the\r\ncontroversy; that, unless it could be accepted, compromise would fail;\r\nand that failure meant certain secession. \"War of a most bitter and\r\nsanguinary character will be sure to follow,\" wrote Senator Grimes of\r\nIowa.[683] \"The heavens are, indeed, black,\" said Dawes of\r\nMassachusetts, \"and an awful storm is gathering. I am well-nigh\r\nappalled at its awful and inevitable consequences.\"[684] Seward did\r\nnot use words of such alarming significance, but he appreciated the\r\nlikelihood of secession. On December 26 he wrote Lincoln that\r\n\"sedition will be growing weaker and loyalty stronger every day from\r\nthe acts of secession as they occur;\" but, in the same letter, he\r\nadded: \"South Carolina has already taken the attitude of defiance.\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana have pushed on to the\r\nsame attitude. I think that they could not be arrested, even if we\r\nshould offer all you suggest, and with it the restoration of the\r\nMissouri Compromise line.\"[685] To his wife, also, to whom alone he\r\nconfided his secret thoughts, he wrote, on the same day: \"The South\r\nwill force on the country the issue that the free States shall admit\r\nthat slaves are property, and treat them as such, or else there will\r\nbe a secession.\"[686]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 683: William Salter, _Life of James W. Grimes_, p. 132.\r\nLetter of December 16, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 684: New York _Tribune_, December 24, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 685: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 485.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 686: _Ibid._, p. 486.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Republican senators of the committee of thirteen,\r\ninspired by the firm attitude of Lincoln, voted against the first\r\nresolution of the Crittenden compromise. They consented that Congress\r\nshould have no power either to abolish slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia without compensation and the consent of its inhabitants, or\r\nto prohibit the transportation of slaves between slave-holding States\r\nand territories; but they refused to protect slavery south of the\r\nMissouri line, especially since such an amendment, by including future\r\nacquisitions of territory, would, as Lincoln declared, popularise\r\nfilibustering for all south of us. \"A year will not pass till we shall\r\nhave to take Cuba as a condition upon which they will stay in the\r\nUnion.\"[687]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 687: Nicolay and Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 3, p. 288.]\r\n\r\nUpon the failure of the Crittenden compromise, Seward, on the part of\r\nthe Republicans, offered five propositions, declaring (1) that the\r\nConstitution should never be altered so as to authorise Congress to\r\nabolish or interfere with slavery in the States; (2) that the fugitive\r\nslave law should be amended by granting a jury trial to the fugitive;\r\n(3) that Congress recommend the repeal by the States of personal\r\nliberty acts which contravene the Constitution or the laws; (4) that\r\nCongress pass an efficient law for the punishment of all persons\r\nengaged in the armed invasion of any State from another; and (5) to\r\nadmit into the Union the remaining territory belonging to the United\r\nStates as two States, one north and one south of the parallel of 36°\r\n30´, with the provision that these States might be subdivided and new\r\nones erected therefrom whenever there should be sufficient population\r\nfor one representative in Congress upon sixty thousand square\r\nmiles.[688] Only the first of these articles was adopted. Southern\r\nDemocrats objected to the second on principle, and to the third on the\r\nground that it would affect their laws imprisoning coloured seamen,\r\nwhile they defeated the fourth by amending it into Douglas' suggestion\r\nfor the revival of the sedition law of John Adams' administration.[689]\r\nThis made it unacceptable to the Republicans. The fifth failed because\r\nit gave the South no opportunity of acquiring additional slave lands.\r\nOn December 28, therefore, the committee, after adopting a resolution\r\nthat it could not agree, closed its labours.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 688: Journal of the Committee of Thirteen, pp. 10, 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 689: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 484.]\r\n\r\nThis seemed to Jefferson Davis, who, in 1860, had assumed the\r\nleadership laid down by John C. Calhoun in 1850, to end all effort at\r\ncompromise, and, on January 10, 1861, in a carefully prepared speech,\r\nhe argued the right of secession. Finally, turning to the Republicans,\r\nhe said: \"Your platform on which you elected your candidate denies us\r\nequality. Your votes refuse to recognise our domestic institutions\r\nwhich pre-existed the formation of the Union, our property which was\r\nguarded by the Constitution. You refuse us that equality without which\r\nwe should be degraded if we remained in the Union. You elect a\r\ncandidate upon the basis of sectional hostility; one who, in his\r\nspeeches, now thrown broadcast over the country, made a distinct\r\ndeclaration of war upon our institutions.... What boots it to tell me\r\nthat no direct act of aggression will be made? I prefer direct to\r\nindirect hostile measures which will produce the same result. I prefer\r\nit, as I prefer an open to a secret foe. Is there a senator upon the\r\nother side who to-day will agree that we shall have equal enjoyment of\r\nthe territories of the United States? Is there one who will deny that\r\nwe have equally paid in their purchases, and equally bled in their\r\nacquisition in war? Then, is this the observance of your contract?\r\nWhose is the fault if the Union be dissolved?\"[690]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 690: _Congressional Globe_, pp. 308, 309.]\r\n\r\nThe country looked to Seward to make answer to these direct questions.\r\nSouthern States were hurrying out of the Union. South Carolina had\r\nseceded on December 20, Mississippi on January 9, Florida on the 10th,\r\nand Alabama on the 11th. Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas were preparing\r\nto follow. The people felt that if a settlement was to come it must be\r\nmade quickly. \"Your propositions would have been most welcome if they\r\nhad been made before any question of coercion, and before any vain\r\nboastings of powers,\" Davis had said. \"But you did not make them when\r\nthey would have been effective. I presume you will not make them\r\nnow.\"[691]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 691: _Ibid._, p. 307.]\r\n\r\nIf the position of the New York senator had been an embarrassing one\r\nat the Astor House on December 22, it was much more difficult on\r\nJanuary 12. He had refused to vote for the Crittenden compromise.\r\nMoreover, the only proposition he had to make stood rejected by the\r\nSouth. What could he say, therefore, that would settle anything? Yet\r\nthe desire to hear him was intense. An eye-witness described the scene\r\nas almost unparalleled in the Senate. \"By ten o'clock,\" wrote this\r\nobserver, \"every seat in the gallery was filled, and by eleven the\r\ncloak-rooms and all the passages were choked up, and a thousand men\r\nand women stood outside the doors, although the speech was not to\r\nbegin until one o'clock. Several hundred visitors came on from\r\nBaltimore. It was the fullest house of the session, and by far the\r\nmost respectful one.\"[692] Such was the faith of the South in Seward's\r\nunbounded influence with Northern senators and Northern people that\r\nthe Richmond _Whig_ asserted that his vote for the Crittenden\r\ncompromise \"would give peace at once to the country.\"[693]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 692: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 493.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 693: The Richmond _Whig_, January 17, 1861.]\r\n\r\nSeward was not unmindful of this influence. \"My own party trusts me,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"but not without reservation. All the other parties, North\r\nand South, cast themselves upon me.\"[694] Judged by his letters at\r\nthis period, it is suggested that he had an overweening sense of his\r\nown importance; he thought that he held in his hands the destinies of\r\nhis country.[695] However this may be, it is certain that he wanted to\r\nembarrass Lincoln by no obstacles of his making. \"I must gain time,\"\r\nhe said, \"for the new Administration to organise and for the frenzy of\r\npassion to subside. I am doing this, without making any compromise\r\nwhatever, by forbearance, conciliation, magnanimity. What I say and do\r\nis said and done, not in view of personal objects, and I am leaving to\r\nposterity to decide upon my action and conduct.\"[696]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 694: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 494.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 695: \"I will try to save freedom and my country,\" Seward\r\nwrote his wife.--F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 487.\r\n\"I have assumed a sort of dictatorship for defence, and am labouring\r\nnight and day with the cities and States.\"--_Ibid._, 491. \"I am the\r\nonly hopeful, calm, conciliatory person.\"--_Ibid._, 497. \"It seems to\r\nme that if I am absent only three days, this Administration, the\r\nCongress, and the district would fall into consternation and\r\ndespair.\"--_Ibid._, 497. \"The present Administration and the incoming\r\none unite in devolving upon me the responsibility of averting civil\r\nwar.\"--_Ibid._, 497.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 696: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 497.]\r\n\r\nIn this spirit Seward made his speech of January 12. He discussed the\r\nfallacies of secession, showing that it had no grounds, or even\r\nexcuse, and declaring that disunion must lead to civil war. Then he\r\navowed his adherence to the Union in its integrity and in every event,\r\n\"whether of peace or of war, with every consequence of honour or\r\ndishonour, of life or death.\" Referring to the disorder, he said: \"I\r\nknow not to what extent it may go. Still my faith in the Constitution\r\nand in the Union abides. Whatever dangers there shall be, there will\r\nbe the determination to meet them. Whatever sacrifices, private or\r\npublic, shall be needful for the Union, they will be made. I feel sure\r\nthat the hour has not come for this great nation to fall.\"\r\n\r\nIn blazing the new line of thought which characterised his speech at\r\nthe Astor House, Seward rose to the plane of higher patriotism, and he\r\nnow broadened and enlarged the idea. During the presidential campaign,\r\nhe said, the struggle had been for and against slavery. That contest\r\nhaving ended by the success of the Republicans in the election, the\r\nstruggle was now for and against the Union. \"Union is not more the\r\nbody than liberty is the soul of the nation. Freedom can be saved with\r\nthe Union, and cannot be saved without it.\" He deprecated mutual\r\ncriminations and recriminations, a continuance of the debate over\r\nslavery in the territories, the effort to prove secession illegal, and\r\nthe right of the federal government to coerce seceding States. He\r\nwanted the Union glorified, its blessings exploited, the necessity of\r\nits existence made manifest, and the love of country substituted for\r\nthe prejudice of faction and the pride of party. When this millennial\r\nday had come, when secession movements had ended and the public mind\r\nhad resumed its wonted calm, then a national convention might be\r\ncalled--say, in one, two, or three years hence, to consider the matter\r\nof amending the Constitution.[697]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 697: New York _Tribune_, January 14, 1861. _Seward's Works_,\r\nVol. 4, p. 651.]\r\n\r\nThis speech was listened to with deep attention. \"During the delivery\r\nof portions of it,\" said one correspondent, \"senators were in tears.\r\nWhen the sad picture of the country, divided into confederacies, was\r\ngiven, Mr. Crittenden, who sat immediately before the orator, was\r\ncompletely overcome by his emotions, and bowed his white head to\r\nweep.\"[698] The _Tribune_ considered it \"rhetorically and as a\r\nliterary performance unsurpassed by any words of Seward's earlier\r\nproductions,\"[699] and Whittier, charmed with its conciliatory tone,\r\npaid its author a noble tribute in one of his choicest poems.[700]\r\nBut the country was disappointed. The Richmond _Enquirer_,\r\nrepresenting the Virginia secessionists, maintained that it destroyed\r\nthe last hope of compromise, because he gave up nothing, not even\r\nprejudices, to save peace in the Union. For the same reason, Union men\r\nof Kentucky and other border States turned from it with profound\r\ngrief. On the other hand, the radical Republicans, disappointed that\r\nit did not contain more powder and shot, charged him with surrendering\r\nhis principles and those of his party, to avert civil war and\r\ndissolution of the Union. But the later-day historian, however,\r\nreadily admits that the rhetorical words of this admirable speech had\r\nan effectual influence in making fidelity to the Union, irrespective\r\nof previous party affiliations, a rallying point for Northern men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 698: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 494.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 699: New York _Tribune_ (editorial), January 14, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 700: TO WILLIAM H.

John A. Dix had become secretary of the treasury, Edwin\r\nStanton attorney-general, and Jeremiah S. Black secretary of state.\r\nSeward knew them intimately, and with Black he conferred publicly.\r\nWith Stanton, however, it seemed advisable to select midnight as the\r\nhour and a basement as the place of conference. \"At length,\" he wrote\r\nLincoln, \"I have gotten a position in which I can see what is going on\r\nin the councils of the President.\"[701] To his wife, he adds: \"The\r\nrevolution gathers apace. It has its abettors in the White House, the\r\ntreasury, the interior. I have assumed a sort of dictatorship for\r\ndefence.\"[702] He advised the President-elect to reach Washington\r\nsomewhat earlier than usual, and suggested having his secretaries of\r\nwar and navy designated that they might co-operate in measures for the\r\npublic safety. Under his advice, on the theory that the national\r\nemblem would strengthen wavering minds and develop Union sentiment,\r\nflags began to appear on stores and private residences. Seward was\r\nablaze with zeal. \"Before I spoke,\" he wrote Weed, \"not one utterance\r\nmade for the Union elicited a response. Since I spoke, every word for\r\nthe Union brings forth a cheering response.\"[703]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 701: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H.

I conferred throughout with General Scott, and\r\nMr. Stanton, then in Mr. Buchanan's Cabinet. I presume I conversed\r\nwith others in a way that seemed to me best calculated to leave the\r\ninauguration of a war to the secessionists, and to delay it, in any\r\ncase, until the new Administration should be in possession of the\r\nGovernment. On the 22d of February, in concert with Mr. Stanton, I\r\ncaused the United States flag to be displayed throughout all the\r\nnorthern and western portions of the United States.\" Letters of W.H.\r\nSeward, June 13, 1867.--William Schouler, _Massachusetts in the Civil\r\nWar_, Vol. 1, pp. 41, 42.]\r\n\r\nBut, amidst it all, Seward's enemies persistently charged him with\r\ninclining to the support of the Crittenden compromise. \"We have\r\npositive information from Washington,\" declared the _Tribune_, \"that a\r\ncompromise on the basis of Mr. Crittenden's is sure to be carried\r\nthrough Congress either this week or the next, provided a very few\r\nmore Republicans can be got to enlist in the enterprise.... Weed goes\r\nwith the Breckenridge Democrats.... The same is true, though less\r\ndecidedly, of Seward.\"[704] It is probable that in the good-fellowship\r\nof after-dinner conversations Seward's optimistic words and\r\n\"mysterious allusions,\"[705] implied more than he intended them to\r\nconvey, but there is not a private letter or public utterance on which\r\nto base the _Tribune's_ statements. Greeley's attacks, however, became\r\nfrequent now. Having at last swung round to the \"no compromise\"\r\npolicy of the radical wing of his party, he found it easy to condemn\r\nthe attitude of Weed and the Unionism of Seward, against whom his\r\nlieutenants at Albany were waging a fierce battle for his election as\r\nUnited States senator.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 704: New York _Tribune_, January 29 and February 6, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 705: A writer in the _North American Review_ (August, 1879,\r\np. 135) speaks of the singular confidence of Siddon of Virginia\r\n(afterwards secretary of war of the Southern Confederacy) in Mr.\r\nSeward, and the mysterious allusions to the skilful plans maturing for\r\nan adjustment of sectional difficulties.]\r\n\r\nOn January 31, Seward had occasion to present a petition, with\r\nthirty-eight thousand signatures, which William E. Dodge and other\r\nbusiness men of New York had brought to Washington, praying for \"the\r\nexercise of the best wisdom of Congress in finding some plan for the\r\nadjustment of the troubles which endanger the safety of the nation,\"\r\nand in laying it before the Senate he took occasion to make another\r\nplea for the Union. \"I have asked them,\" he said, \"that at home they\r\nact in the same spirit, and manifest their devotion to the Union,\r\nabove all other interests, by speaking for the Union, by voting for\r\nthe Union, by lending and giving their money for the Union, and, in\r\nthe last resort, fighting for the Union--taking care, always, that\r\nspeaking goes before voting, voting goes before giving money, and all\r\ngo before a battle. This is the spirit in which I have determined for\r\nmyself to come up to this great question, and to pass through it.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Mason of Virginia, declaring that \"a maze of generalities\r\nmasked the speech,\" pressed Seward as to what he meant by\r\n\"contributing money for the Union.\" Seward replied: \"I have\r\nrecommended to them in this crisis, that they sustain the government\r\nof this country with the credit to which it is entitled at their\r\nhands.\" To this Mason said: \"I took it for granted that the money was\r\nto sustain the army which was to conduct the fight that he recommends\r\nto his people.\" Seward responded: \"If, then, this Union is to stand or\r\nfall by the force of arms, I have advised my people to do, as I shall\r\nbe ready to do myself--stand with it or perish with it.\" To which the\r\nVirginia Senator retorted: \"The honourable senator proposes but one\r\nremedy to restore this Union, and that is the _ultima ratio regna_.\"\r\nSeward answered quickly, \"Not to restore--preserve!\"\r\n\r\nMason then referred to Seward's position as one of battle and\r\nbloodshed, to be fought on Southern soil, for the purpose of reducing\r\nthe South to colonies. To Seward, who was still cultivating the\r\nattitude of \"forbearance, conciliation, and magnanimity,\" this sounded\r\nlike a harsh conclusion of the position he had sought to sugar-coat\r\nwith much rhetoric, and, in reply, he pushed bloodshed into the\r\nfar-off future by restating what he had already declared in fine\r\nphrases, closing as follows: \"Does not the honourable senator know\r\nthat when all these [suggestions for compromise] have failed, then the\r\nStates of this Union, according to the forms of the Constitution,\r\nshall take up this controversy about twenty-four negro slaves\r\nscattered over a territory of one million and fifty thousand square\r\nmiles, and say whether they are willing to sacrifice all this liberty,\r\nall this greatness, and all this hope, because they have not\r\nintelligence, wisdom, and virtue enough to adjust a controversy so\r\nfrivolous and contemptible.\"[706]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 706: W.H. Seward, _Works of_, Vol. 4, p. 670. _Congressional\r\nGlobe_, 1861, p. 657.]\r\n\r\nSeward's speech plainly indicated a purpose to fight for the\r\npreservation of the Union, and his talk of first exhausting\r\nconciliatory methods was accepted in the South simply as a \"resort to\r\nthe gentle powers of seduction,\"[707] but his argument of the few\r\nslaves in the great expanse of territory sounded so much like Weed,\r\nwho was advocating with renewed strength the Crittenden plan along\r\nsimilar lines of devotion to the Union, that it kept alive in the\r\nNorth the impression that the Senator would yet favour compromise, and\r\ngave Greeley further opportunity to assail him. \"Seward, in his speech\r\non Thursday last,\" says the _Tribune_, \"declares his readiness to\r\nrenounce Republican principles for the sake of the Union.\"[708] The\r\nnext day his strictures were more pronounced. \"The Republican party\r\n... is to be divided and sacrificed if the thing can be done. We are\r\nboldly told it must be suppressed, and a Union party rise upon its\r\nruins.\"[709] Yet, in spite of such criticism, Seward bore himself with\r\nindomitable courage and with unfailing skill. Never during his whole\r\ncareer did he prove more brilliant and resourceful as a leader in what\r\nmight be called an utterly hopeless parliamentary struggle for the\r\npreservation of the Union, and the highest tributes[710] paid to his\r\nnever-failing tact and temper during some of the most vivid and\r\nfascinating passages of congressional history, attest his success. It\r\nwas easy to say, with Senator Chandler of Michigan, that \"without a\r\nlittle blood-letting this Union will not be worth a rush,\"[711] but it\r\nrequired great skill to speak for the preservation of the Union and\r\nthe retention of the cornerstone of the Republican party, without\r\ngrieving the Unionists of the border States, or painfully affecting\r\nthe radical Republicans of the Northern States. Seward knew that the\r\nlatter censured him, and in a letter to the _Independent_ he explains\r\nthe cause of it. \"Twelve years ago,\" he wrote, \"freedom was in danger\r\nand the Union was not. I spoke then so singly for freedom that\r\nshort-sighted men inferred that I was disloyal to the Union. To-day,\r\npractically, freedom is not in danger, and Union is. With the attempt\r\nto maintain Union by civil war, _wantonly_ brought on, there would be\r\ndanger of reaction against the Administration charged with the\r\npreservation of both freedom and Union. Now, therefore, I speak singly\r\nfor Union, striving, if possible, to save it peaceably; if not\r\npossible, then to cast the responsibility upon the party of slavery.\r\nFor this singleness of speech I am now suspected of infidelity to\r\nfreedom.\"[712]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 707: \"Oily Gammon Seward, aware that intimidation will not\r\ndo, is going to resort to the gentle powers of seduction.\"--Washington\r\ncorrespondent of Charleston _Mercury_, February 19, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 708: New York _Tribune_, February 4, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 709: New York _Tribune_, February 5, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 710: \"I have rejoiced, as you of New York must certainly\r\nhave done, in the spirit of conciliation which has repeatedly been\r\nmanifested, during the present session of Congress, by your\r\ndistinguished senator, Governor Seward.\" Robert C.

Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 507.]\r\n\r\nLincoln, after his arrival in Washington, asked Seward to suggest such\r\nchanges in his inaugural address as he thought advisable, and in the\r\nperformance of this delicate duty the New York Senator continued his\r\npolicy of conciliation. \"I have suggested,\" he wrote, in returning the\r\nmanuscript, \"many changes of little importance, severally, but in\r\ntheir general effect, tending to soothe the public mind. Of course the\r\nconcessions are, as they ought to be, if they are to be of avail, at\r\nthe cost of the winning, the triumphant party. I do not fear their\r\ndispleasure. They will be loyal whatever is said. Not so the defeated,\r\nirritated, angered, frenzied party.... Your case is quite like that of\r\nJefferson. He brought the first Republican party into power against\r\nand over a party ready to resist and dismember the government.\r\nPartisan as he was, he sank the partisan in the patriot, in his\r\ninaugural address; and propitiated his adversaries by declaring, 'We\r\nare all Federalists; all Republicans.' I could wish that you would\r\nthink it wise to follow this example, in this crisis. Be sure that\r\nwhile all your administrative conduct will be in harmony with\r\nRepublican principles and policy, you cannot lose the Republican party\r\nby practising, in your advent to office, the magnanimity of a\r\nvictor.\"[713]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 713: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 512.]\r\n\r\nOf thirty-four changes suggested by Seward, the President-elect\r\nadopted twenty-three outright, and based modifications on eight\r\nothers. Three were ignored. Upon only one change did the Senator\r\nreally insist. He thought the two paragraphs relating to the\r\nRepublican platform adopted at Chicago should be omitted, and, in\r\nobedience to his judgment, Lincoln left them out. Seward declared the\r\nargument of the address strong and conclusive, and ought not in any\r\nway be changed or modified, \"but something besides, or in addition to\r\nargument, is needful,\" he wrote in a postscript, \"to meet and remove\r\n_prejudice_ and _passion_ in the South, and _despondency_ and _fear_\r\nin the East. Some words of affection. Some of calm and cheerful\r\nconfidence.\"[714] In line with this suggestion, he submitted the draft\r\nof two concluding paragraphs. The first, \"made up of phrases which had\r\nbecome extremely commonplace by iteration in the six years' slavery\r\ndiscussion,\" was clearly inadmissible.[715] The second was as follows:\r\n\"I close. We are not, we must not be, aliens or enemies, but fellow\r\ncountrymen and brethren. Although passion has strained our bonds of\r\naffection too hardly, they must not, I am sure they will not, be\r\nbroken. The mystic chords which, proceeding from so many battlefields\r\nand so many patriot graves, pass through all the hearts and all the\r\nhearths in this broad continent of ours, will yet again harmonise in\r\ntheir ancient music when breathed upon by the guardian angel of the\r\nnation.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 714: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 3, p. 513.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 715: Nicolay and Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 3, p. 343,\r\n_note_.]\r\n\r\nThis was the germ of a fine poetic thought, says John Hay, that \"Mr.\r\nLincoln took, and, in a new development and perfect form, gave to it\r\nthe life and spirit and beauty which have made it celebrated.\" As it\r\nappears in the President-elect's clear, firm handwriting, it reads as\r\nfollows: \"I am loth to close. We are not enemies but friends. We must\r\nnot be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break\r\nour bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from\r\nevery battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and\r\nhearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of\r\nthe Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better\r\nangels of our nature.\"[716]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 716: _Ibid._, pp. 343, 344, and _note_.\r\n\r\nFor fac-simile of the paragraph as written by Seward and rewritten by\r\nLincoln, see _Ibid._, Vol. 3, p. 336. For the entire address, with all\r\nsuggested and adopted changes, see _Ibid._, Vol. 3, pp. 327 to 344.\r\n\r\nAt Seward's dinner table on the evening of March 4, the peroration of\r\nthe inaugural address was especially commended by A. Oakey Hall,\r\nafterward mayor of New York, who quickly put it into rhyme:\r\n\r\n    \"The mystic chords of Memory\r\n      That stretch from patriot graves;\r\n    From battlefields to living hearts,\r\n      Or hearth-stones freed from slaves,\r\n    An Union chorus shall prolong,\r\n      And grandly, proudly swell,\r\n    When by those better angels touched\r\n      Who in all natures dwell.\"]\r\n\r\nThe spirit that softened Lincoln's inaugural into an appeal that\r\ntouched every heart, had breathed into the debates of Congress the\r\nconciliation and forbearance that marked the divide between the\r\nconservative and radical Republican. This difference, at the last\r\nmoment, occasioned Lincoln much solicitude. He had come to Washington\r\nwith his Cabinet completed except as to a secretary of the treasury\r\nand a secretary of war. For the latter place Seward preferred Simon\r\nCameron, and, in forcing the appointment by his powerful advocacy, he\r\ndealt a retributive blow to Governor Curtin of Pennsylvania, who had\r\nvigorously opposed him at Chicago and was now the most conspicuous of\r\nCameron's foes.[717] But Senator Chase of Ohio, to whom Seward\r\nstrenuously objected because of his uncompromising attitude, was given\r\nthe treasury. The shock of this defeat led the New York Senator to\r\ndecline entering the Cabinet. \"Circumstances which have occurred since\r\nI expressed my willingness to accept the office of secretary of\r\nstate,\" he wrote, on March 2, \"seem to me to render it my duty to ask\r\nleave to withdraw that consent.\"[718]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 717: \"Seward and his friends were greatly offended at the\r\naction of Curtin at Chicago. I was chairman of the Lincoln state\r\ncommittee and fighting the pivotal struggle of the national battle,\r\nbut not one dollar of assistance came from New York, and my letters to\r\nThurlow Weed and to Governor Morgan, chairman of the national\r\ncommittee, were unanswered. Seward largely aided the appointment of a\r\nCabinet officer in Pennsylvania, who was the most conspicuous of\r\nCurtin's foes, and on Curtin's visit to Seward as secretary of state,\r\nhe gave him such a frigid reception that he never thereafter called at\r\nthat department.\"--Alex. K. McClure, _Recollections of Half a\r\nCentury_, p. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 718: Nicolay and Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 3, p. 370.]\r\n\r\nThe reception of the unexpected note sent a shiver through Lincoln's\r\nstalwart form. This was the man of men with whom for weeks he had\r\nconfidentially conferred, and upon whose judgment and information he\r\nhad absolutely relied and acted, \"I cannot afford to let Seward take\r\nthe first trick,\" he said to his secretary,[719] after pondering the\r\nmatter during Sunday, and on Monday morning, while the inauguration\r\nprocession was forming, he penned a reply. \"Your note,\" he said, \"is\r\nthe subject of the most painful solicitude with me; and I feel\r\nconstrained to beg that you will countermand the withdrawal. The\r\npublic interest, I think, demands that you should; and my personal\r\nfeelings are deeply enlisted in the same direction. Please consider\r\nand answer by nine o'clock a.m. to-morrow.\" That night, after the\r\nday's pageant and the evening's reception had ended, the President and\r\nSeward talked long and confidentially, resulting in the latter's\r\nwithdrawal of his letter and his nomination and confirmation as\r\nsecretary of state. \"The President is determined that he will have a\r\ncompound Cabinet,\" Seward wrote his wife, a few days after the unhappy\r\nincident; \"and that it shall be peaceful, and even permanent. I was at\r\none time on the point of refusing--nay, I did refuse, for a time, to\r\nhazard myself in the experiment. But a distracted country appeared\r\nbefore me, and I withdrew from that position. I believe I can endure\r\nas much as any one; and may be that I can endure enough to make the\r\nexperiment successful.\"[720]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 719: _Ibid._, Vol. 3, p. 371.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 720: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 518.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE WEED MACHINE CRIPPLED\r\n\r\n1861\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the first forty days of Lincoln's administration is one\r\nof indecent zeal to obtain office. A new party had come into power,\r\nand, in the absence of any suggestion of civil service, patronage was\r\nconceded to the political victors. Office-seekers in large numbers had\r\nvisited Washington in 1841 after the election of President Harrison,\r\nand, in the change that followed the triumph of Taylor in 1848,\r\nSeward, then a new senator, complained of their pernicious activity.\r\nMarcy as secretary of state found them no less numerous and insistent\r\nin 1853 when the Whigs again gave way to the Democrats. But never in\r\nthe history of the country had such a cloud of applicants settled down\r\nupon the capital of the nation as appeared in 1861. McClure, an\r\neye-witness of the scene, speaks of the \"mobs of office-seekers,\"[721]\r\nand Edwin M. Stanton, who still remained in Washington, wrote Buchanan\r\nthat \"the scramble for office is terrific. Every department is\r\noverrun, and by the time all the patronage is distributed the\r\nRepublican party will be dissolved.\"[722] Schuyler Colfax declared to\r\nhis mother that \"it makes me heart-sick. All over the country our\r\nparty is by the ears, fighting for offices.\"[723] Seward, writing to\r\nhis wife on March 16, speaks of the affliction. \"My duties call me to\r\nthe White House one, two, or three times a day. The grounds, halls,\r\nstairways, closets, are filled with applicants, who render ingress\r\nand egress difficult.\"[724] Lincoln himself said: \"I seem like one\r\nsitting in a palace, assigning apartments to importunate applicants,\r\nwhile the structure is on fire and likely soon to perish in\r\nashes.\"[725] Stanton is authority for the statement \"that Lincoln\r\ntakes the precaution of seeing no stranger alone.\"[726]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 721: Alex. K. McClure, _Recollections of Half a Century_, p.\r\n204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 722: George T. Curtis, _Life of James Buchanan_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n530.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 723: O.B. Hallister, _Life of Colfax_, p. 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 724: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 530.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 725: Alex. K. McClure, _Life of Lincoln_, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 726: George T. Curtis, _Life of James Buchanan_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n530.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _North American Review_ says, \"the clamour for offices\r\nis already quite extraordinary, and these poor people undoubtedly\r\nbelong to the horde which has pressed in here seeking places under the\r\nnew Administration, which neither has nor can hope to have places\r\nenough to satisfy one-twentieth the number.\" November, 1879, p. 488.]\r\n\r\nIn this bewildering mass of humanity New York had its share. Seward\r\nsought protection behind his son, Frederick W. Seward, whom the\r\nPresident had appointed assistant secretary of state. \"I have placed\r\nhim where he must meet the whole army of friends seeking office,\" he\r\nwrote his wife on March 8--\"an hundred taking tickets when only one\r\ncan draw a prize.\"[727] Roscoe Conkling, then beginning his second\r\nterm in Congress, needed no barrier of this kind. \"Early in the year\r\n1861,\" says his biographer, \"a triumvirate of Republicans assumed to\r\ndesignate candidates for the offices which President Lincoln was about\r\nto fill in the Oneida district. To accomplish this end they went to\r\nWashington and called upon their representative, handing him a list of\r\ncandidates to endorse for appointment. Mr. Conkling read it carefully,\r\nand, seeing that it contained undesirable names, he replied:\r\n'Gentlemen, when I need your assistance in making the appointments in\r\nour district, I shall let you know.' This retort, regarded by some of\r\nhis friends as indiscreet, was the seed that years afterward ripened\r\ninto an unfortunate division of the Republican party.\"[728]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 727: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 518.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 728: A.R. Conkling, _Life and Letters of Roscoe Conkling_,\r\npp. 119, 120.]\r\n\r\nIf Seward was more tactful than Conkling in the dispensation of\r\npatronage, he was not less vigilant and tenacious. Almost immediately\r\nafter inauguration it became apparent that differences relative to\r\nlocal appointments existed between him and Ira Harris, the newly\r\nelected New York senator. Harris' tall and powerful form,\r\ndistinguished by a broad and benevolent face, was not more marked than\r\nthe reputation that preceded him as a profound and fearless judge. At\r\nthe Albany bar he had been the associate of Marcus T. Reynolds, Samuel\r\nStevens, Nicholas Hill, and the venerable Daniel Cady, and if he did\r\nnot possess the wit of Reynolds or the eloquence of Cady, the\r\nindomitable energy of Stevens and the mental vigour of Nicholas Hill\r\nwere his, making conspicuous his achievements in the pursuit of truth\r\nand justice. His transfer to the Senate at the age of fifty-eight and\r\nhis appointment upon the judiciary and foreign relations committees,\r\npresented a new opportunity to exhibit his deep and fruitful interest\r\nin public affairs, and, as the friend of Senators Collamer of Vermont\r\nand Sumner of Massachusetts, he was destined to have an influential\r\nshare in the vital legislation of the war period.\r\n\r\nHarris took little interest in the distribution of patronage, or in\r\nquestions of party politics that quicken local strife, but he insisted\r\nupon a fair recognition of his friends, and to adjust their\r\ndifferences Seward arranged an evening conference to which the\r\nPresident was invited. At this meeting the discussion took a broad\r\nrange. The secretary of state had prepared a list covering the\r\nimportant offices in New York, but before he could present it,\r\nLincoln, with the ready intuitions of a shrewd politician, remarked\r\nthat he reserved to himself the privilege of appointing Hiram Barney\r\ncollector of the port of New York. This announcement did not surprise\r\nSeward, for, at the conclusion of Weed's visit to Springfield in the\r\npreceding December, Lincoln reminded the journalist that he had said\r\nnothing about appointments. \"Some gentlemen who have been quite\r\nnervous about the object of your visit here,\" said the President-elect,\r\n\"would be surprised, if not incredulous, were I to tell them that\r\nduring the two days we have passed together you have made no\r\napplication, suggestion, or allusion to political appointments.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the shrewd manager, willing to wait until Seward's appointment\r\nand confirmation as secretary of state had placed him in a position to\r\ndirect rather than to beg patronage, replied that nothing of that\r\nnature had been upon his mind, since he was much more concerned about\r\nthe welfare of the country. \"This,\" said Lincoln, \"is undoubtedly a\r\nproper view of the question, and yet so much were you misunderstood\r\nthat I have received telegrams from prominent Republicans warning me\r\nagainst your efforts to forestall important appointments in your\r\nState. Other gentlemen who have visited me since the election have\r\nexpressed similar apprehensions.\" The President, thus cunningly\r\nleading up to what was on his mind, said further that it was\r\nparticularly pleasant to him to reflect that he was coming into office\r\nunembarrassed by promises. \"I have not,\" said he, \"promised an office\r\nto any man, nor have I, but in a single instance, mentally committed\r\nmyself to an appointment; and as that relates to an important office\r\nin your State, I have concluded to mention it to you--under strict\r\ninjunctions of secrecy, however. If I am not induced by public\r\nconsiderations to change my purpose, Hiram Barney will be collector of\r\nthe port of New York.\"[729]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 729: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n612.]\r\n\r\nTo Weed, Barney's name aroused no agreeable memories. At the formation\r\nof the Republican party he had found it easier to affiliate with\r\nLucius Robinson and David Dudley Field than to act in accord with the\r\nWhig leader, and the result at Chicago had emphasised this\r\nindependence. Too politic, however, to antagonise the appointment, and\r\ntoo wary to indorse it, Weed replied that prior to the Chicago\r\nconvention he had known Barney very slightly, but that, if what he had\r\nlearned of him since was true, Barney was entitled to any office he\r\nasked for. \"He has not asked for this or any other office,\" said\r\nLincoln, quickly; \"nor does he know of my intention.\"[730]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 730: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2,\r\npp. 612, 613.]\r\n\r\nIf the President-elect failed to draw out the adroit New Yorker, he\r\nhad tactfully given notice of his intention not to be controlled by\r\nhim. A political boss, outside his own State, usually bears the\r\nreputation that home opponents give him, and, although Weed was never\r\nso bad as painted by his adversaries, he had long been a chief with an\r\nodious notoriety. Apparently disinterested, and always refusing to\r\nseek or to accept office himself, he loved power, and for years,\r\nwhenever Whig or Republican party was ascendant in New York, his\r\nambition to prescribe its policy, direct its movements, and dictate\r\nthe men who might hold office, had been discreetly but imperiously\r\nexercised, until his influence was viewed with abhorrence by many and\r\nwith distrust by the country.[731] It is doubtful if Lincoln's opinion\r\ncorresponded with the accepted one,[732] but his desire to have some\r\navenue of information respecting New York affairs opened to him other\r\nthan through the Weed machine, made the President bold to declare his\r\nindependence at the outset.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 731: Gideon Welles, _Lincoln and Seward_, p. 22.\r\n\r\n\"In pecuniary matters Weed was generous to a fault while poor; he is\r\nsaid to be less so since he became rich.... I cannot doubt, however,\r\nthat if he had never seen Wall Street or Washington, had never heard\r\nof the Stock Board, and had lived in some yet undiscovered country,\r\nwhere legislation is never bought nor sold, his life would have been\r\nmore blameless, useful, and happy. I was sitting beside him in his\r\neditorial room soon after Governor Seward's election, when he opened a\r\nletter from a brother Whig, which ran substantially thus: 'Dear Weed:\r\nI want to be a bank examiner. You know how to fix it. Do so, and draw\r\non me for whatever sum you may see fit. Yours truly.' In an instant\r\nhis face became prematurely black with mingled rage and mortification.\r\n'My God,' said he, 'I knew that my political adversaries thought me a\r\nscoundrel, but I never till now supposed that my friends\r\ndid.'\"--Horace Greeley, _Recollections of a Busy Life_, pp. 312, 313.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 732: \"President Lincoln looked to Mr. Weed for counsel, when,\r\nas often during the war, he met with difficulties hard to surmount. It\r\nwas Mr. Lincoln's habit at such times to telegraph Mr. Weed to come to\r\nWashington from Albany or New York, perhaps at an hour's notice. He\r\noften spent the day with the President, coming and returning by night,\r\nregardless of his age and infirmities. His services in these\r\nexigencies were often invaluable.\"--Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of\r\nThurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 288.]\r\n\r\nThe immediate influence that led to the announcement of Barney's\r\nselection, however, is not entirely clear. At the Cooper Institute\r\nmeeting in February, 1860, at which Lincoln spoke, Barney occupied a\r\nseat on the stage, and was among the few gentlemen having opportunity\r\nto pay the distinguished Illinoisan those courtesies which especially\r\nplease one who felt, as Lincoln did \"by reason of his own modest\r\nestimate of himself,\"[733] that he was under obligation to any person\r\nshowing him marked attention. But neither this fact nor Barney's\r\nsubsequent support at Chicago sufficiently accounts for the strong\r\npreference indicated by such an important and far-reaching\r\nappointment. Among the few indorsements on file in the treasury\r\ndepartment at Washington, one letter, dated March 8, 1861, and\r\naddressed to Salmon P. Chase, speaks of Barney as \"a personal friend\r\nof yours.\" Six days later a New York newspaper announced that \"the\r\nappointment of Barney has been a fixed fact ever since Chase went into\r\nthe Cabinet. It was this influence that persuaded Chase to accept the\r\nposition.\"[734] The biographer of Thurlow Weed, probably basing the\r\nstatement upon the belief of Weed himself, states, without\r\nqualification, that \"Barney was appointed through the influence of\r\nSecretary Chase.\"[735] This may, in part, account for Weed's and\r\nSeward's bitter hostility to the Ohioan's becoming a member of the\r\nCabinet; for, if Chase, before his appointment as secretary of the\r\ntreasury, had sufficient influence to control the principal federal\r\noffice in New York, what, might they not have asked, would be the\r\nmeasure of this influence after the development of his great ability\r\nas a financier has made him necessary to the President as well as to\r\nthe country?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 733: Nicolay and Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 2, p. 217.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 734: New York _Herald_, March 14, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 735: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n613.]\r\n\r\nInquiry, however, as to the one first suggesting Barney's name to\r\nLincoln does not lead to the open. Chase's entrance into the Cabinet\r\nbeing settled, his influence firmly sustained Barney, but, before\r\nthat, very early after the election, between November 7 and Weed's\r\nvisit to Springfield on December 17, some one spoke the word in\r\nBarney's behalf which left such a deep and lasting impression upon the\r\nPresident's mind that he determined to advise Weed, before Seward\r\ncould accept the state portfolio, of his intention to appoint Barney\r\ncollector of the port of New York. The name of the person exerting\r\nsuch an influence, however, is now unknown. During this period Chase\r\nneither saw the President-elect, nor, so far as the records show,\r\nwrote him more than a formal note of congratulations. Another possible\r\navenue of communication may have been Bryant or Greeley, but the\r\nlatter distinctly denied that he asked, or wanted, or manipulated the\r\nappointment of any one.[736] Bryant, who had great influence with\r\nLincoln,[737] and who strongly opposed Seward's going into the\r\nCabinet,[738] had presided at the Cooper Institute meeting and sat\r\nbeside Hiram Barney. He knew that such a man, placed at the head of\r\nthe custom-house and wielding its vast patronage, could be a potent\r\nfactor in breaking Weed's control, but the editor's only published\r\nletter to Lincoln during this period was confined to reasons for\r\nmaking Chase secretary of state. In it he did not deprecate the\r\nstrengthening of the Weed machine which would probably ignore the\r\noriginal New York supporters of Lincoln, or in any wise refer to local\r\nmatters. Bryant had been partial to Chase for President until after\r\nLincoln's Cooper Institute speech, and now, after election, he thought\r\nChase, as secretary of state, would be best for the country.\r\nLincoln's reply of \"a few lines,\" convincing his correspondent \"that\r\nwhatever selection you make it will be made conscientiously,\"\r\ncontained no word about Barney. Other letters, or parties personally\r\ninterested in Barney, may have passed between the President-elect and\r\nBryant, or Chase. Indeed, Lincoln confessed to Weed that he had\r\nreceived telegrams and visits from prominent Republicans, warning him\r\nagainst the Albany editor's efforts to forestall important state\r\nappointments, but no clue is left to identify them. The mystery\r\ndeepens, too, since, whatever was done, came without Barney's\r\nsuggestion or knowledge.[739]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 736: New York _Tribune_, editorial, April 2, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 737: \"'It was worth the journey to the East,' said Mr.\r\nLincoln, 'to see such a man as Bryant.'\"--John Bigelow, _Life of\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant_, p. 218.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 738: Nicolay and Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 3, p. 257.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 739: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n613.]\r\n\r\nHiram Barney, a native of Jefferson County, a graduate of Union\r\nCollege in 1834, and the head of a well-known law firm, was a lawyer\r\nof high character and a Republican of Democratic antecedents, who had\r\nstood with Greeley and Bryant in opposing Seward at Chicago, and whose\r\nappointment to the most important federal office in the State meant\r\nmischief for Weed.[740] In its effect it was not unlike President\r\nGarfield's selection of William H. Robertson for the same place; and,\r\nalthough it did not at once result so disastrously to Weed as\r\nRobertson's appointment did to Conkling twenty years later, it gave\r\nthe editor's adversaries vantage ground, which so seriously crippled\r\nthe Weed machine, that, in the succeeding November, George Opdyke, a\r\npersonal enemy of Thurlow Weed,[741] was nominated and elected mayor\r\nof New York City.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 740: \"Hiram Barney belongs to the Van Buren Democratic\r\nBuffalo Free-soil wing of the Republican party.

He was also a delegate to\r\nthe Buffalo convention of 1848; so that as an out-and-out Van Buren\r\nDemocratic Free-soil Republican, Barney is a better specimen than Van\r\nBuren himself.\"--New York _Herald_, March 28, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barney's quiet, unostentatious bearing has deprived him of the\r\nnotoriety which attaches to most of our politicians of equal\r\nexperience and influence. Nevertheless, he is well known to the\r\nRepublican party and universally respected as one of its foremost and\r\nmost intelligent supporters.\"--New York _Evening Post_, March 27,\r\n1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 741: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n528; _Ibid._, Vol. 2, p. 322.]\r\n\r\nAt the conference of the President and New York senators, Seward,\r\naccepting the inevitable, received Lincoln's announcement of Barney's\r\nappointment in chilling silence. Without openly disclosing itself, the\r\nproposed step had been the cause of much friction, and was yet to be\r\nopposed with coolness and candour,[742] but Lincoln's firmness in\r\ndeclaring that Barney was a man of integrity who had his confidence,\r\nand that he had made the appointment on his own responsibility and\r\nfrom personal knowledge,[743] impressed his hearers with the belief\r\nthat, with whatever disfavour Seward listened, he had practically\r\nsurrendered to the will of his superior. Another scene occurred, as\r\nthe interview proceeded, which also indicated the master spirit. After\r\nreviewing the extended list of names presented for collectors and\r\nother officers, Seward expressed the wish that the nominations might\r\nbe sent forthwith to the Senate. The embarrassed senators, unprepared\r\nfor such haste, found in the secretary of the navy, who had\r\naccompanied the President on the latter's invitation, a ready opponent\r\nto such a plan because other members of the Cabinet had been wholly\r\nignored. Welles inquired if the secretary of the treasury and\r\nattorney-general had been consulted, insisting that a proper\r\nadministration of the departments made their concurrence in the\r\nselection of competent subordinates upon whom they must rely, not only\r\nproper but absolutely necessary. Seward objected to this as\r\nunnecessary, for these were New York appointments, he said, and he\r\nknew better than Chase and Bates what was best in that State for the\r\nparty and the Administration. The President, however, agreed with the\r\nsecretary of the navy, declaring that nothing conclusive would be done\r\nuntil he had advised with interested heads of departments. \"With\r\nthis,\" says Welles, \"the meeting soon and somewhat abruptly\r\nterminated.\"[744] So far as it related to the distribution of\r\npatronage, this conference, held early in March, settled nothing\r\nbeyond Barney's appointment; as to the question whether Seward was\r\nPresident or Premier, however, the New Yorker soon learned that he was\r\nto have influence with his chief only by reason of his assiduous\r\nattention to the public business and his dexterity and tact in\r\npromoting the views of the President.[745]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 742: \"Strong protests against Barney have been received\r\nwithin the last twenty-four hours.\"--New York _Herald_, March 14,\r\n1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 743: Gideon Welles, _Lincoln and Seward_, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 744: Gideon Welles, _Lincoln and Seward_, p. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 745: \"Executive skill and vigour are rare qualities. The\r\nPresident is the best of us.\" Seward's letter to his wife.--F.W.\r\nSeward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 590.]\r\n\r\nTo the outsider, the appointment of Barney looked, for the moment,\r\nlike a substantial defeat for Seward. \"The mighty struggle,\" said the\r\n_Herald_, \"is for the possession of the New York appointments, and the\r\nstrife is deadly and bitter.\"[746] The anti-Weed forces, reinforced by\r\nthe arrival of Greeley,[747] the coming of Barney,[748] and the\r\npersistence of Harris,[749] were elated over reported changes in the\r\nWeed slate, believing the fruit of their long labours was about to\r\ncome at last, but from the sum-total of the nominations, made day by\r\nday, it appeared that while several attachés of the _Tribune's_ staff\r\nhad been recognised,[750] Seward had secured all the important\r\noffices save collector of the port.[751] During this turmoil the\r\nSecretary's unfailing calmness was not disturbed, nor his uniform\r\ncourtesy ruffled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 746: New York _Herald_, March 30, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 747: \"Thurlow Weed patched up the New York appointments and\r\nleft this morning. Greeley arrived about the same time and has been\r\nsponging Weed's slate at an awful rate.\"--_Ibid._, March 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 748: \"Barney arrived this morning in response to a summons\r\nfrom the President and the secretary of the treasury.\"--_Ibid._, April\r\n1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 749: \"Senator Harris has proved himself more than a match\r\nfor Weed.\"--_Ibid._, April 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 750: \"Thus far four attachés of the _Tribune_ have been\r\nappointed.... These appointments except the last were Mr. Lincoln's\r\nregardless of Mr. Seward, who bears the _Tribune_ no love.\"--_Ibid._,\r\nMarch 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 751: \"Seward secures all the important offices save the\r\ncollectorship, which was given to Greeley.\"--New York _Herald_, March\r\n30, 1861.]\r\n\r\nSeward never forgot a real friend. Out of thirty-five diplomatic posts\r\ncarrying a salary of five thousand dollars and upward, the Empire\r\nState was credited with nine; and, of these, one, a minister\r\nplenipotentiary, received twelve thousand dollars, and seven ministers\r\nresident, seventy-five hundred each. Seward, with the advice of\r\nThurlow Weed, filled them all with tried and true supporters. Greeley,\r\nwho, for some time, had been murmuring about the Secretary's\r\nappointments, let fly, at last, a sarcastic paragraph or two about the\r\nappointment of Andrew B. Dickinson, the farmer statesman of Steuben,\r\nwhich betrayed something of the bitterness existing between the\r\nSecretary of State and the editor of the _Tribune_. For more than a\r\nyear no such thing had existed as personal relations. Before the\r\nspring of 1860 they met frequently with a show of cordiality, and,\r\nalthough the former understood that the latter boasted an independence\r\nof control whenever they differed in opinion, the _Tribune_\r\nco-operated and its editor freely conferred with the New York senator\r\nduring the long struggle in Congress for Kansas and free labour; but\r\nafter Seward's defeat at Chicago they never met,[752] dislike\r\ndisplaced regard, and the _Tribune_, with eye and ear open to catch\r\nwhatever would make its adversary wince, indulged in bitter sarcasm.\r\nWilliam B. Taylor's reappointment as postmaster at New York City gave\r\nit opportunity to praise Taylor and criticise Seward, claiming that\r\nthe former, who had held office under Buchanan, though an excellent\r\nofficial, was not a Republican. This proved so deep a thrust, arraying\r\noffice-seekers and their friends against the Secretary and Thurlow\r\nWeed, that Greeley kept it up, finding some appointees inefficient,\r\nand the Republicanism of others insufficient.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 752: \"In the spring of 1859, Governor Seward crossed the\r\nAtlantic, visiting Egypt, traversing Syria, and other portions of Asia\r\nMinor as well as much of Europe. Soon after his return he came one\r\nevening to my seat in Dr. Chapin's church,--as he had repeatedly done\r\nduring former visits to our city,--and I now recall this as the last\r\noccasion on which we ever met.\"--Horace Greeley, _Recollections of a\r\nBusy Life_, p. 321.]\r\n\r\nTo the former class belonged the minister resident to Nicaragua.\r\nDickinson had wearied of a farmer's life,[753] and Seward, who often\r\nbenefited by his ardent and influential friendship, bade him make his\r\nown selection from the good things he had to offer. More than ordinary\r\nreasons existed why the Secretary desired to assist the Steuben\r\nfarmer. Dickinson served in the State Senate throughout Seward's two\r\nterms as governor, and during these four years he had fearlessly and\r\nfaithfully explained and defended Seward's recommendation of a\r\ndivision of the school fund, which proved so offensive to many\r\nthousand voters in New York. Indeed, it may be said with truth, that\r\nSeward's record on that one question did more to defeat him at Chicago\r\nthan all his \"irrepressible conflict\" and \"higher-law\" declarations.\r\nIt became the fulcrum of Curtin's and Lane's aggressive resistance,\r\nwho claimed that, in the event of his nomination, the American or\r\nKnow-Nothing element in Pennsylvania and Indiana would not only\r\nmaintain its organisation, but largely increase its strength, because\r\nof its strong prejudices against a division of the school fund.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 753: \"'Bray Dickinson,' as he was generally and familiarly\r\ncalled, whose early education was entirely neglected but whose\r\nperceptions and intuitions were clear and ready, was an enterprising\r\nfarmer,--too enterprising, indeed, for he undertook more than he could\r\naccomplish. His ambition was to be the largest cattle and produce\r\ngrower in his county (Steuben). If his whole time and thoughts had\r\nbeen given to farming, his anticipations might have been realised,\r\nbut, as it was, he experienced the fate of those who keep too many\r\nirons in the fire. In 1839 he was elected to the State Senate, where\r\nfor four years he was able, fearless, and inflexibly honest. On one\r\noccasion a senator from Westchester County criticised and ridiculed\r\nDickinson's language. Dickinson immediately rejoined, saying that\r\nwhile his difficulty consisted in a want of suitable language with\r\nwhich to express his ideas, his colleague was troubled with a flood of\r\nwords without any ideas to express.\"--Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of\r\nThurlow Weed_, Vol. 1, pp. 441, 442.]\r\n\r\nDickinson met this issue squarely. He followed the powerful\r\nPennsylvanian and Indianian from delegation to delegation, explaining\r\nthat Seward had sought simply to turn the children of poor foreigners\r\ninto the path of moral and intellectual cultivation pursued by the\r\nAmerican born,--a policy, he declared, in which all Republicans and\r\nChristian citizens should concur. He pictured school conditions in New\r\nYork City in 1840, the date of Seward's historic message; he showed\r\nhow prejudices arising from differences of language and religion kept\r\nschoolhouses empty and slum children ignorant, while reform schools\r\nand prisons were full. Under these circumstances, thundered the\r\nSteuben farmer, Seward did right in recommending the establishment of\r\nschools in which such children might be instructed by teachers\r\nspeaking the same language with themselves, and professing the same\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThis was the sort of defence Seward appreciated. His recommendation\r\nhad not been the result of carelessness or inadvertence, and, although\r\nwell-meaning friends sought to excuse it as such, he resented the\r\ninsinuation. \"I am only determined the more,\" he wrote, \"to do what\r\nmay be in my power to render our system of education as comprehensive\r\nas the interests involved, and to provide for the support of the\r\nglorious superstructure of universal suffrage,--the basis of universal\r\neducation.\"[754] In his defence, Dickinson maintained the excellence\r\nof Seward's suggestion, and it deeply angered the Steuben farmer that\r\nthe _Tribune's_ editor, who knew the facts as well as he, did not also\r\nattempt to silence the arguments of the two most influential Lincoln\r\ndelegates, who boldly based their opposition, not upon personal\r\nhostility or his advanced position in Republican faith, but upon what\r\nGreeley had known for twenty years to be a perversion of Seward's\r\nlanguage and Seward's motives.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 754: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 1, p. 503.]\r\n\r\nIn the Secretary's opinion Dickinson's bold defiance of the rules of\r\ngrammar and spelling did not weaken his natural intellectual strength;\r\nbut Greeley, whom the would-be diplomat, with profane vituperation,\r\nhad charged at Chicago with the basest ingratitude,[755] protested\r\nagainst such an appointment to such an important post. \"We have long\r\nknown him,\" said the _Tribune_, \"as a skilful farmer, a cunning\r\npolitician, and a hearty admirer of Mr. Seward, but never suspected\r\nhim of that intimate knowledge of the Spanish language which is almost\r\nindispensable to that country, which, just at this moment, from the\r\npeculiar designs of the Southern rebels, is one of the most important\r\nthat the secretary of state has to fill.\"[756] Dickinson recognised\r\nthe odium that would attach to Seward because of the appointment, and\r\nin a characteristic letter he assured the Secretary of State that,\r\nwhatever Greeley might say, he need have no fear of his ability to\r\nrepresent the government efficiently at the court of Nicaragua.[757]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 755: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n273.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 756: New York _Tribune_, March 29, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 757: \"Hornby, April 3, 1861. Dear Seward: I shall have to\r\ntake a Gentleman with me that can speak the Spanish language and\r\ncorrect bad English. That being well done I can take care of the\r\nballance [Transcriber's Note: so in original] Greeley to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.... You have much at stake in my appointment as it is\r\ncharged (and I know how justly) to your account.\"--Unpublished letter\r\nin files of State Department.]\r\n\r\nJames S. Pike's selection for minister resident to The Hague seemed to\r\ncontradict Greeley's declaration that he neither asked nor desired the\r\nappointment of any one. For years Pike, \"a skilful maligner of Mr.\r\nSeward,\"[758] had been the Washington representative of the _Tribune_,\r\nand the belief generally obtained that, although Pike belonged to\r\nMaine and was supported by its delegation in Congress, the real power\r\nbehind the throne lived in New York. Nevertheless, the _Tribune's_\r\neditor, drifting in thought and speech in the inevitable direction of\r\nhis genius, soon indicated that he had had no personal favours to ask.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 758: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n326.]\r\n\r\nSeward's appointment as secretary of state chilled Greeley's love for\r\nthe new Administration.[759] The _Tribune's_ editor seems never to\r\nhave shown an exalted appreciation of Abraham Lincoln. Although they\r\nserved together in Congress, and, for twenty years, had held to the\r\nsame political faith, Greeley, apparently indifferent to his\r\ncolleague's success, advocated, in 1858, the return of Stephen A.\r\nDouglas to the United States Senate, because of his hostility to the\r\nLecompton policy of the Buchanan administration, and it was intimated\r\nthat this support, backed by his powerful journal, may have resulted\r\nin Douglas' carrying the Legislature against Lincoln. In 1860, Greeley\r\nfavoured Bates for President. He was not displeased to have Lincoln\r\nnominated, but his battle had been to defeat Seward, and when Lincoln\r\nturned to Seward for secretary of state, which meant, as Greeley\r\nbelieved, the domination of the Weed machine to punish his revolt\r\nagainst Seward, Greeley became irretrievably embittered against the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 759: \"I am charged with having opposed the selection of\r\nGovernor Seward for a place in President Lincoln's Cabinet. That is\r\nutterly, absolutely false, the President himself being my witness. I\r\nmight call many others, but one such is sufficient.\"--New York\r\n_Tribune_, signed editorial, July 25, 1861.]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if Lincoln and Greeley, under any circumstances, could\r\nhave had close personal relations. Lack of sympathy because they did\r\nnot see things alike must have kept them apart; but Seward's presence\r\nin the Cabinet undoubtedly limited Greeley's intercourse with the\r\nPresident at a time when frequent conferences might have avoided grave\r\nembarrassments. His virile and brilliant talents, which turned him\r\ninto an independent and acute thinker on a wide range of subjects,\r\nalways interested his readers, giving expression to the thoughts of\r\nmany earnest men who aided in forming public opinion in their\r\nneighbourhoods, so that it may be said with truth, that, in 1860 and\r\n1861, everything he wrote was eagerly read and discussed in the North.\r\n\"Notwithstanding the loyal support given Lincoln throughout the\r\ncountry,\" says McClure, \"Greeley was in closer touch with the active,\r\nloyal sentiment of the people than even the President himself.\"[760]\r\nHis art of saying things on paper seemed to thrill people as much as\r\nthe nervous, spirited rhetoric of an intense talker. With the air of\r\nlofty detachment from sordid interests, his sentences, clear and\r\nrapid, read like the clarion notes of a peroration, and impressed his\r\ngreat audiences with an earnestness that often carried conviction even\r\nto unwilling listeners.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 760: Alex. K. McClure, _Lincoln and Men of War Times_, p.\r\n295.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the _Tribune's_ columns did not manifest toward the\r\nAdministration a fine exhibition of the love of fair play. In the\r\nhottest moment of excitement growing out of hostilities, it\r\npatriotically supported the most vigorous prosecution of the war, and\r\nmercilessly criticised its opponents; but Greeley would neither\r\nconform to nor silently endure Lincoln's judgment, and, as every step\r\nin the war created new issues, his constant criticism, made through\r\nthe columns of a great newspaper, kept the party more or less\r\nseriously divided, until, by untimely forcing emancipation, he\r\ninspired, despite the patient and conciliatory methods of Lincoln, a\r\nfactious hostility to the President which embarrassed his efforts to\r\nmarshal a solid North in support of his war policy. Greeley was a man\r\nof clean hands and pure heart, and, at the outset, it is probable that\r\nhis attempted direction of Lincoln's policy existed without\r\nill-feeling; yet he was a good hater, and, as the contest went on, he\r\ndrifted into an opposition which gradually increased in bitterness,\r\nand, finally, led to a temporary and foolish rebellion against the\r\nPresident's renomination. Meantime, the great-hearted Lincoln, conning\r\nthe lesson taught by the voice of history, continued to practise the\r\nprecept,\r\n\r\n    \"Saying, What is excellent,\r\n    As God lives, is permanent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA POLITICAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nSTATE OF NEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nDeALVA STANWOOD ALEXANDER, A.M., LL.D.\r\n\r\n_Member of Congress, Formerly United States Attorney for the Northern\r\nDistrict of New York_\r\n\r\n\r\nVOL.

Grave doubt obtained as to the\r\ngovernment's physical ability to succour the fort, but, assuming it\r\npossible, was it wise as a political measure? The majority of the\r\nCabinet, including Seward, voted in the negative, giving rise to the\r\nreport that Sumter would be abandoned. Union people generally, wishing\r\nto support the brave and loyal action of Major Anderson and his little\r\nband, vigorously protested against such an exhibition of weakness, and\r\nthe longer the Government hesitated the more vigorously the popular\r\nwill resented such a policy. Finally, on March 29, in spite of General\r\nScott's advice and Secretary Seward's opinion, the President, guided\r\nby public sentiment, directed a relief expedition to be ready to sail\r\nas early as April 6.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a Confederate constitution had been adopted, a Confederate\r\nflag raised over the capitol at Montgomery, and a Confederate Congress\r\nassembled, which had authorised the enlistment of 100,000 volunteers,\r\nthe issue of $1,000,000 in treasury notes, and the organisation of a\r\nnavy. To take charge of military operations at Charleston, the\r\nConfederate government commissioned Pierre T. Beauregard a\r\nbrigadier-general and placed him in command of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nBeauregard quickly learned of Lincoln's decision to relieve Sumter,\r\nand upon the Confederate authorities devolved the grave responsibility\r\nof reducing the fort before the relief expedition arrived. In\r\ndiscussing this serious question Robert Toombs, the Confederate\r\nsecretary of state, did not hesitate to declare that \"the firing upon\r\nit at this time is suicide, murder, and will lose us every friend at\r\nthe North. You will wantonly strike a hornet's nest which extends from\r\nmountain to ocean, and legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us\r\nto death. It is unnecessary; it puts us in the wrong; it is fatal.\"[761]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 761: Pleasant A. Stovall, _Life of Robert Toombs_, p. 226.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Jefferson Davis, already overborne by pressure from\r\nSouth Carolina, ordered Beauregard to demand its evacuation, and, if\r\nrefused, \"to reduce it.\"[762] Answering Beauregard's aides, who\r\nsubmitted the demand on the afternoon of April 11, Anderson refused to\r\nwithdraw, adding, \"if you do not batter the fort to pieces about us,\r\nwe shall be starved out in a few days.\"[763] To this message the\r\nConfederate Secretary of War replied: \"Do not desire needlessly to\r\nbombard Fort Sumter. If Major Anderson will state the time at which,\r\nas indicated by him, he will evacuate, and agree in the meantime he\r\nwill not use his guns against us unless ours should be employed\r\nagainst Sumter, you are authorised thus to avoid the effusion of\r\nblood. If this or its equivalent be refused, reduce the fort as your\r\njudgment decides to be the most practicable.\"[764] Four aides submitted\r\nthis proposition at a quarter before one o'clock on the morning of\r\nApril 12, to which Anderson, after conferring two hours and a half\r\nwith his officers, replied, \"I will evacuate by noon on the 15th\r\ninstant, and I will not in the meantime open fire upon your forces\r\nunless compelled to do so by some hostile act against this fort or the\r\nflag of my Government, should I not receive, prior to that time,\r\ncontrolling instructions from my Government or additional\r\nsupplies.\"[765]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 762: Official Records, Vol. 1, p. 297.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 763: _Ibid._, pp. 13, 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 764: _Ibid._, p. 301. Davis's message to the Confederate\r\nCongress, April 29; Moore's Rebellion Record, Vol. 1, Docs. p. 171.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 765: Official Records, Vol. 1, pp. 14, 60.]\r\n\r\nThe aides refused these terms, and without further consultation with\r\nBeauregard notified Anderson that in one hour their batteries would\r\nopen fire on the fort. Prompt to the minute, at 4.30 o'clock in the\r\nmorning, a shell from Fort Johnson, signalling the bombardment to\r\nbegin, burst directly over Sumter. At seven o'clock Anderson's force,\r\nnumbering one hundred and twenty-eight officers, men, and\r\nnon-combatant labourers, who had breakfasted upon half rations of pork\r\nand damaged rice, began returning the fire, which continued briskly at\r\nfirst and afterwards intermittently until the evacuation on Sunday\r\nafternoon, the 14th inst.[766]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 766: _Ibid._, Vol. 1, p. 12.]\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-four hours the prophecy of Robert Toombs was practically\r\nfulfilled, for when, on Monday, April 15, President Lincoln called for\r\n75,000 State militia to execute the laws, the people of the North rose\r\nalmost as one man to support the government. \"At the darkest moment in\r\nthe history of the Republic,\" Emerson wrote, \"when it looked as if the\r\nnation would be dismembered, pulverised into its original elements,\r\nthe attack on Fort Sumter crystalised the North into a unit, and the\r\nhope of mankind was saved.\"[767]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 767: J.E. Cabot, _Life of Ralph Waldo Emerson_, p. 605.]\r\n\r\nMuch speculation had been indulged respecting the attitude of New York\r\nCity. It was the heart of the Union and the home of Southern sympathy.\r\nMen had argued coolly and philosophically about the right of\r\nsecession, and journals of wide influence daily exhibited strong\r\nSouthern leanings. Owing to business connections and social\r\nintercourse with the South, merchants had petitioned for concessions\r\nso offensive to Lincoln that Southern statesmen confidently relied\r\nupon their friendship as an important factor in dividing the North. On\r\nmany platforms Daniel S. Dickinson, James T. Brady, John Cochrane, and\r\nothers equally well known and influential, had held the North\r\nresponsible for conditions that, it was claimed, were driving the\r\nSouth into secession. So recently as December 20, in a meeting of more\r\nthan ordinary importance, held on Pine Street, at which Charles\r\nO'Conor presided, and John A. Dix, John J. Cisco, William B. Astor,\r\nand others of similar character were present, Dickinson declared that\r\n\"our Southern brothers will reason with us when we will reason with\r\nthem.... The South have not offended us.... But their slaves have been\r\nrun off in numbers by an underground railroad, and insult and injury\r\nreturned for a constitutional duty.... If we would remain a united\r\npeople we must treat the Southern States as we treated them on the\r\ninauguration of the government--as political equals.\"[768]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 768: _Life and Speeches of Daniel S. Dickinson_, Vol. 1, pp.\r\n700-702.]\r\n\r\nIn a speech at Richmond on March 14 Cochrane promised that New York\r\nwould sustain Virginia in any policy it adopted,[769] and on April 4 a\r\nConfederate commissioner, writing from Manhattan, reported to\r\nJefferson Davis that two hundred of the most influential and wealthy\r\ncitizens were then arranging the details to declare New York a free\r\ncity. Several army officers as well as leading ship-builders, said the\r\nletter, had been found responsive, through whose assistance recruits\r\nfrom the ranks of the conspirators were to seize the navy yard, forts,\r\nand vessels of war, and to hold the harbor and city.[770] While nothing\r\nwas known to the friends of the Union of the existence of such a\r\nconspiracy, deep anxiety prevailed as to how far the spirit of\r\nrebellion which had manifested itself in high places, extended among\r\nthe population of the great metropolis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 769: New York _Tribune_, March 15, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 770: Letter of John W. Forsyth, MSS. Confederate Diplomatic\r\nCorrespondence, April 4, 1861.]\r\n\r\nThe guns aimed at Sumter, however, quickly removed the impression that\r\nthe greed of commerce was stronger than the love of country. The Stock\r\nExchange resounded with enthusiastic cheers for Major Anderson, and\r\ngenerous loans showed that the weight of the financial and trade\r\ncentre of the country was on the side of the national government. But\r\nmore convincing proof of a solid North found expression in the spirit\r\nof the great meeting held at Union Square on Saturday, April 20.\r\nNothing like it had ever been seen in America. Men of all ranks,\r\nprofessions, and creeds united in the demonstration. Around six\r\nplatforms, each occupied with a corps of patriotic orators, an\r\nillustrious audience, numbering some of the most famous Democrats of\r\nthe State, who had quickly discarded political prejudices, stood for\r\nhours listening to loyal utterances that were nobly illustrated by the\r\nvalour of Major Anderson, whose presence increased the enthusiasm into\r\na deafening roar of repeated cheers. If any doubt heretofore existed\r\nas to the right of coercing a State, or upon whom rested the\r\nresponsibility for beginning the war, or who were the real enemies of\r\nthe Union, or where prominent members of the Democratic party would\r\nstand, it had now disappeared. The partisan was lost in the patriot.\r\n\r\nDaniel S. Dickinson travelled two hundred miles to be present at this\r\nmeeting, and his attitude, assumed without qualification or\r\nreservation, especially pleased the lovers of the Union. Of all men he\r\nhad retained and proclaimed his predilections for the South with the\r\nzeal and stubbornness of an unconverted Saul. Throughout the long\r\ndiscussion of twenty years his sympathy remained with the South, his\r\nambitions centred in the South, and his words, whether so intended or\r\nnot, encouraged the South to believe in a divided North. But the guns\r\nat Sumter changed him as quickly as a voice converted St. Paul. \"It\r\nwere profitless,\" he said, his eyes resting upon the torn flag that\r\nhad waved over Sumter--\"it were profitless to inquire for original or\r\nremote causes; it is no time for indecision or inaction.... I would\r\nassert the power of the government over those who owe it allegiance\r\nand attempt its overthrow, as Brutus put his signet to the\r\ndeath-warrant of his son, that I might exclaim with him, 'Justice is\r\nsatisfied, and Rome is free.' For myself, in our federal relations, I\r\nknow but one section, one Union, one flag, one government. That\r\nsection embraces every State; that Union is the Union sealed with the\r\nblood and consecrated by the tears of the revolutionary struggle; that\r\nflag is the flag known and honoured in every sea under heaven; that\r\ngovernment is the government of Washington, and Adams, and Jefferson,\r\nand Jackson; a government which has shielded and protected not only\r\nus, but God's oppressed children, who have gathered under its wings\r\nfrom every portion of the globe.\"[771]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 771: _Life, Letters, and Speeches of Daniel S. Dickinson_.\r\nVol. 2, pp. 4-7.]\r\n\r\nFernando Wood, until recently planning to make New York an independent\r\ncity, now declared the past buried, with its political associations\r\nand sympathies, and pledged the municipality, its money and its men,\r\nto the support of the Union. \"I am with you in this contest. We know\r\nno party, now.\"[772] Of the fifty or more speeches delivered from the\r\nseveral platforms, perhaps the address of John Cochrane, whose\r\nridiculous Richmond oration was scarcely a month old, proved the most\r\nimpressive. Cochrane had a good presence, a clear, penetrating voice,\r\nand spoke in round, rhetorical periods. If he sometimes illustrated\r\nthe passionate and often the extravagant declaimer, his style was\r\nfinished, and his fervid appeals deeply stirred the emotions if they\r\ndid not always guide the reason. It was evident that he now spoke with\r\nthe sincere emotion of one whose mind and heart were filled with the\r\ncause for which he pleaded. In his peroration, pointing to the torn\r\nflag of Sumter, he raised the vast audience to such a pitch of\r\nexcitement that when he dramatically proclaimed his motto to be, \"Our\r\ncountry, our whole country--in any event, a united country,\" the\r\ncontinued cheering was with great difficulty sufficiently suppressed\r\nto allow the introduction of another speaker.[773]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 772: New York _Tribune_, April 22, 1861. New York _Times_,\r\nNew York _Herald_, April 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 773: New York _Herald_, April 21, 1861.]\r\n\r\nOf the regiments called for New York's quota was seventeen. Governor\r\nMorgan immediately communicated it to the Legislature, which\r\nauthorised in a few hours the enlistment of 30,000 volunteers for two\r\nyears. Instantly every drill room and armory in the State became a\r\nscene of great activity, and by April 19, four days after the call,\r\nthe Seventh New York, each man carrying forty-eight rounds of ball\r\ncartridge, received an enthusiastic ovation as it marched down\r\nBroadway on its way to Washington. Thereafter, each day presented,\r\nsomewhere in the State, a similar pageant. Men offered their services\r\nso much faster than the Government could take them that bitterness\r\nfollowed the fierce competition.[774] By July 1 New York had despatched\r\nto the seat of war 46,700 men--an aggregate that was swelled by\r\nDecember 30 to 120,361. Loans to the government, offered with an\r\nequally lavish hand, approximated $33,000,000 in three months.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 774: New York _Tribune_, July 21, 24.]\r\n\r\nTo aid in the purchase and arming of steamships and in the movement of\r\ntroops and forwarding of supplies, President Lincoln, during the\r\nexcitement incident to the isolation of Washington, conferred\r\nextraordinary powers upon Governor Morgan, William M. Evarts, and\r\nMoses H. Grinnell, to whom army officers were instructed to report for\r\norders. Similar powers to act for the Treasury Department in the\r\ndisbursement of public money were conferred upon John A. Dix, George\r\nOpdyke, and Richard M. Blatchford. These gentlemen gave no security\r\nand received no compensation, but \"I am not aware,\" wrote Lincoln, at\r\na later day, \"that a dollar of the public funds, thus confided,\r\nwithout authority of law, to unofficial persons, was either lost or\r\nwasted.\"[775]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 775: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 2, p. 552.]\r\n\r\nThe Union Square meeting appointed a Union Defence Committee to raise\r\nmoney, provide supplies, and equip regiments. For the time this\r\ncommittee became the executive arm of the national government in New\r\nYork, giving method to effort and concentrating the people's energies\r\nfor the highest efficiency. John A. Dix, who had seen sixteen years of\r\npeace service in the regular army, equipped regiments and despatched\r\nthem to Washington, while James S. Wadsworth, a man without military\r\nexperience but of great public spirit, whose courage and energy\r\nespecially fitted him for the work, loaded steamboats with provisions\r\nand accompanied them to Annapolis. Soon afterwards Dix became a\r\nmajor-general of volunteers, while Wadsworth, eager for active\r\nservice, accepted an appointment on General McDowell's staff with the\r\nrank of major. This took him to Manassas, and within a month gave him\r\na \"baptism of fire\" which distinguished him for coolness, high\r\ncourage, and great capacity. On August 9 he was made a brigadier-general\r\nof volunteers, thus preceding in date of commission all other New\r\nYorkers of similar rank not graduates of West Point.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later Daniel E. Sickles, no less famous in the political\r\narena, who was to win the highest renown as a fighter, received\r\nsimilar rank. Sickles, at the age of twenty-two, began public life as\r\na member of the Assembly, and in the succeeding fourteen years served\r\nas corporation attorney, secretary of legation at London, State\r\nsenator, and congressman. A Hunker in politics, an adept with the\r\nrevolver, and fearless in defence, he had the habit of doing his own\r\nthinking. Tammany never had a stronger personality. He was not always\r\na successful leader and he cared little for party discipline, but as\r\nan antagonist bent on having his own way his name had become a\r\nhousehold word in the metropolis and in conventions. In the\r\nanti-slavery crusade his sympathies were Southern. He opposed Lincoln,\r\nhe favoured compromise, and he encouraged the cotton States to believe\r\nin a divided North. Nevertheless, when the Union was assaulted, the\r\nsoldier spirit that made him major of the Twelfth National Guards in\r\n1852 took him to Washington at the head of the Excelsior Brigade,\r\nconsisting of five regiments, fully armed and equipped, and ready to\r\nserve during the war. He reached the capital at the time when more\r\nregiments were offered than General Scott would accept, but with the\r\nenergy that afterward characterised his action at Gettysburg he sought\r\nthe President, who promptly gave him the order that mustered his men\r\nand put him in command.[776] Other leaders who had voiced Southern\r\nsentiments, notably John Cochrane, soon found places at the front.\r\nIndeed, those who had professed the warmest friendship for the South\r\nwere among the first to speak or take up arms against it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 776: \"He went direct to the President, and asked him, in\r\nproper language, if he approved of the petty intrigues that sought to\r\ndefeat his patriotic purpose. 'I know nothing of them, General,' said\r\nthe President, 'and have only this to say, that, whatever are the\r\nobstacles thrown in your way, come to me, and I will remove them\r\npromptly. Should you stand in need of my assistance to hasten the\r\norganisation of your brigade, come to me again, and I will give or do\r\nwhatever is required. I want your men, General, and you are the man to\r\nlead them. Go to the Secretary of War and get your instructions\r\nimmediately.'\"--New York _Herald_, May 17, 1861.]\r\n\r\nThe Confederates, entering upon the path of revolution with the hope\r\nof a divided North, exhibited much feeling over this unanimity of\r\nsentiment. \"Will the city of New York 'kiss the rod that smites her,'\"\r\nasked the leading paper in Virginia, \"and at the bidding of her Black\r\nRepublican tyrants war upon her Southern friends and best customers?\r\nWill she sacrifice her commerce, her wealth, her population, her\r\ncharacter, in order to strengthen the arm of her oppressors?\"[777] Ten\r\ndays later another influential representative of Southern sentiment,\r\nwatching the proceedings of the great Union Square meeting, answered\r\nthe inquiry. \"The statesmen of the North,\" said the Richmond\r\n_Enquirer_, \"heretofore most honoured and confided in by the South,\r\nhave come out unequivocally in favor of the Lincoln policy of coercing\r\nand subjugating the South.\"[778] The Charleston _Mercury_ called the\r\nroll of these statesmen in the several States. \"Where,\" it asked, \"are\r\nFillmore, Van Buren, Cochrane, McKeon, Weed, Dix, Dickinson, and\r\nBarnard, of New York, in the bloody crusade proposed by President\r\nLincoln against the South? Unheard of in their dignified retirement,\r\nor hounding on the fanatic warfare, or themselves joining 'the noble\r\narmy of martyrs for liberty' marching on the South.\"[779] Other papers\r\nwere no less indignant. \"We are told,\" said the Richmond _Examiner_,\r\n\"that the whole North is rallying as one man--Douglas, veering as ever\r\nwith the popular breeze; Buchanan lifting a treacherous and\r\ntime-serving voice of encouragement from the icy atmosphere of\r\nWheatland; and well-fed and well-paid Fillmore, eating up all his past\r\nwords of indignation for Southern injuries, and joining in the popular\r\nhue-and-cry against his special benefactors.\"[780] The _Enquirer_,\r\nspeaking of Daniel S. Dickinson as \"the former crack champion of\r\nSouthern Rights,\" sneered at his having given his \"adhesion to Lincoln\r\nand all his abolition works.\"[781] To the South which believed in the\r\nconstitutional right of secession, the contest for the Union was a war\r\nof subjugation, and whoever took part in it was stigmatised. \"The\r\nproposition to _subjugate_,\" said the _Examiner_, \"comes from the\r\nmetropolis of the North's boasted conservatism, even from the largest\r\nbeneficiary of Southern wealth--New York City.\"[782]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 777: Richmond _Examiner_, April 15, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 778: April 26, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 779: April 23, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 780: April 24, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 781: April 22, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 782: April 30, 1861.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the patriotic uprising of the North, so disappointing\r\nand surprising to the South, an event occurred that cast a deep shadow\r\nover New York in common with the rest of the country. The press,\r\npresumably voicing public opinion, demanded that the army begin the\r\nwork for which it was organised. Many reasons were given--some\r\nquixotic, some born of suspicion, and others wholly unworthy their\r\nsource. The New York _Tribune_, in daily articles, became alarmingly\r\nimpatient, expressing the fear that influences were keeping the armies\r\napart until peace could be obtained on humiliating terms to the\r\nNorth.[783] Finally, on June 27, appeared a four-line, triple-leaded\r\nleader, printed in small capitals, entitled \"The Nation's War-Cry.\" It\r\nwas as mandatory as it was conspicuous. \"Forward to Richmond! Forward\r\nto Richmond! The Rebel Congress must not be allowed to meet there on\r\nthe 20th of July! By that date the place must be held by the National\r\nArmy!\"[784] This war-cry appeared from day to day with editorials\r\nindicating a fear of Democratic intrigue, and hinting at General\r\nScott's insincerity.[785]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 783: June 24, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 784: _Ibid._, June 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 785: \"Do you pretend to know more about military affairs than\r\nGeneral Scott? ask a few knaves, whom a great many simpletons know no\r\nbetter than to echo. No, Sirs! we know very little of the art of war,\r\nand General Scott a great deal. The real question--which the above is\r\nasked only to shuffle out of sight--is this: Does General Scott\r\ncontemplate the same ends, and is he animated by like impulses and\r\npurposes, with the great body of the loyal, liberty-loving people of\r\nthis country? Does he want the Rebels routed, or would he prefer to\r\nhave them conciliated?\"--_Ibid._, July 1, 1861.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott did not approve a battle at that time. He thought the\r\ntroops insufficiently drilled and disciplined. On the other hand, the\r\nPresident argued that a successful battle would encourage the country,\r\nmaintain the unanimity of the war sentiment, and gain the respect of\r\nforeign governments. General McDowell had 30,000 men in the vicinity\r\nof Bull Run, Virginia, of whom 1,600 were regulars--the rest, for the\r\nmost part, three months' volunteers whose term of enlistment soon\r\nexpired. At Martinsburg, General Patterson, a veteran of two wars,\r\ncommanded 20,000 Federal troops. Opposed to the Union forces, General\r\nBeauregard had an effective army of 22,000, with 9,000 in the\r\nShenandoah Valley under command of Joseph E. Johnston. In obedience to\r\nthe popular demand McDowell moved his troops slowly toward\r\nBeauregard's lines, and on Sunday, July 21, attacked with his whole\r\nforce, gaining a complete victory by three o'clock in the afternoon.\r\nMeantime, however, Johnston, having eluded Patterson, brought to the\r\nfield at the supreme moment two or three thousand fresh troops and\r\nturned a Confederate defeat into a Union rout and panic.[786]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 786: Of 49 regiments engaged, 19 were from New York, and of\r\nthe 3,343 killed, wounded, and missing, 1,230 were New Yorkers.--Official\r\nRecords, Series 1, Vol. 2, pp. 314, 315, 351, 387, 405, 426.]\r\n\r\nAfter coolness and confidence had displaced the confusion of this wild\r\nstampede, it became clear that the battle of Bull Run had been well\r\nplanned, and that for inexperienced and undisciplined troops\r\nMcDowell's army had fought bravely. It appeared plain that had\r\nPatterson arrived with 2,300 fresh troops instead of Johnston, the\r\nConfederates must have been the routed and panic-stricken party. To\r\nthe North, however, defeat was the source of much shame. It seemed a\r\nverification of the Southern boast that one Confederate could whip two\r\nYankees, and deepened the conviction that the war was to be long and\r\nsevere. Moreover, fear was expressed that it would minimise the much\r\ndesired sympathy of England and other foreign governments. But it\r\nbrought no abatement of energy. With one voice the press of the North\r\ndemanded renewed activity, and before a week had elapsed every\r\ndepartment of government girded itself anew for the conflict.[787] The\r\nvigour and enthusiasm of this period have been called a second\r\nuprising of the North, and the work of a few weeks exhibited the\r\nwonderful resources of a patriotic people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 787: See the New York _Tribune_, _Herald_, _Times_, _World_,\r\n_Evening Post_, July 22, 23, 25, and later dates.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nNEW PARTY ALIGNMENTS\r\n\r\n1861\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bull Run fomented mutterings, freighted with antagonism\r\nto the war. Certain journals violently resented the suspension of the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_, while the Act of Congress, approved August 3,\r\nproviding for the freedom of slaves employed in any military or naval\r\nservice, called forth such extreme denunciations that the United\r\nStates grand jury for the Southern District of New York asked the\r\nCourt if the authors were subject to indictment. \"These\r\nnewspapers,\"[788] said the foreman, \"are in the frequent practice of\r\nencouraging the rebels now in arms against the Federal Government by\r\nexpressing sympathy and agreement with them, the duty of acceding to\r\ntheir demands, and dissatisfaction with the employment of force to\r\novercome them. Their conduct is, of course, condemned and abhorred by\r\nall loyal men, but the grand jury will be glad to learn from the Court\r\nthat they are also subject to indictment and condign punishment.\" The\r\nPostmaster-General's order excluding such journals from the mails\r\nintensified the bitterness. The arrests of persons charged with giving\r\naid and comfort to the enemy also furnished partisans an opportunity\r\nto make people distrustful of such summary methods by magnifying the\r\ndanger to personal liberty. In a word, the Bull Run disaster had\r\nbecome a peg upon which to hang sympathy for the South.[789]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 788: New York _Journal of Commerce_, _News_, _Day-Book_,\r\n_Freeman's Journal_, Brooklyn _Eagle_.--Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1861,\r\np. 329.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 789: \"I have had a conversation this morning with a prominent\r\nDemocrat, who is entirely devoted to sustaining the government in the\r\npresent struggle. He informs me that the leaders of that party are\r\nopposed to the war and sympathise with the South; that they keep quiet\r\nbecause it will not advance their views to move just now.\" Letter of\r\nWilliam Gray, dated September 4, to Secretary Chase.--Chase Papers,\r\nMS.]\r\n\r\nDifferences likewise appeared among Republicans. The Weed and\r\nanti-Weed factions still existed, but these divisions now grew out of\r\ndifferences far deeper than patronage. After the bombardment of Fort\r\nSumter, Thurlow Weed desired the conflict conducted on lines that\r\nwould unite the North into one party responding to the cry of \"Union,\r\nnow and forever.\" He believed this might be done and that rebellion\r\ncould thus be confined to the extreme cotton region, if the loyal\r\nelement in the Border States was cherished and representatives of all\r\nparties were permitted to participate in civil as well as military\r\naffairs. To this end he sought to avoid the question of emancipation,\r\ncordially approving the President's course in modifying Fremont's\r\nproclamation of the preceding August, which liberated the slaves of\r\ntraitorous owners in Missouri. Weed pushed his contention to the\r\nextreme. Following the spirit of his rejected compromise he insisted\r\nthat every act of the Government should strengthen and encourage the\r\nUnion men of the Border States, among which he included North Carolina\r\nand Tennessee, and he bitterly resented the policy of urging the army,\r\nhastily and without due preparation, to fight \"political battles\" like\r\nthat of Bull Run. On the other hand, the radical anti-slavery element\r\nof the country, led by Secretary Chase in the Cabinet, by Senator\r\nSumner in Congress, and backed by Horace Greeley in the _Tribune_,\r\ndisliked the President's policy of trying to conciliate Kentucky and\r\nother Border States by listening to the demands of slavery. This\r\nfactional difference became doubly pronounced after Lincoln's\r\nmodification of the Fremont proclamation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Democratic criticisms and Republican differences,\r\nhowever, the supporters of Lincoln, anxious to teach the seceding\r\nStates an object lesson in patriotism, desired to unite both parties\r\ninto one Union organisation, pledged to the vigorous prosecution of\r\nthe war and the execution of the laws in all parts of the country. To\r\nRepublicans this plan looked easy. Most people professed to favour the\r\npreservation of the Union, and thousands of young men irrespective of\r\nparty had enlisted for the suppression of armed rebellion. Moreover, a\r\nunion of parties at such a critical moment, it was argued, would be\r\nmore helpful in discouraging the South than victory on the\r\nbattlefield. Accordingly the Republican State Committee proposed to\r\nthe Democrats early in August that in the election to occur on\r\nNovember 4 a single ticket be nominated, fairly representative of all\r\nparties upon a simple war platform.\r\n\r\nAbout Dean Richmond, chairman of the Democratic State Committee, still\r\nclustered Peter Cagger, William B. Ludlow, Sanford E. Church, and\r\nother Soft leaders, with Horatio Seymour substantially in control.\r\nThese men had not participated in the Union Square meeting on April\r\n20, nor had their sentiments been voiced since the fall of Fort\r\nSumter; but it was well known that their views did not coincide with\r\nthose of Daniel S. Dickinson, John A. Dix, James T. Brady, Greene C.\r\nBronson, and other leaders of the Hards. Richmond's reply, therefore,\r\nwas not disappointing. He admitted the wisdom of filling public\r\noffices with pure and able men who commanded the confidence of the\r\npeople, and suggested, with a play of sarcasm, that if such an example\r\nwere set in filling Federal offices, it would probably be followed in\r\nthe selection of State officers. But the politics of men in office, he\r\ncontinued, was of little importance compared to sound principles.\r\nDemocrats would unite with all citizens opposed to any war and equally\r\nto any peace which is based upon the idea of the separation of these\r\nStates, and who regard it the duty of the Federal government at all\r\ntimes to hold out terms of peace and accommodation to the dissevered\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"Our political system,\" he continued, \"was founded in compromise, and\r\nit can never be dishonourable in any Administration to seek to restore\r\nit by the same means. Above all, they repel the idea that there exists\r\nbetween the two sections of the Union such an incompatibility of\r\ninstitutions as to give rise to an irrepressible conflict between\r\nthem, which can only terminate in the subjugation of one or the other.\r\nRepelling the doctrine that any State can rightfully secede from the\r\nUnion, they hold next in abhorrence that aggressive and fanatical\r\nsectional policy which has so largely contributed to the present\r\ndanger of the country. They propose, therefore, to invite to union\r\nwith them all citizens of whatever party, who, believing in these\r\nviews, will act with them to secure honest administration in Federal\r\nand State affairs, a rigid maintenance of the Constitution, economy in\r\npublic expenditures, honesty in the award of contracts, justice to the\r\nsoldier in the field and the taxpayer at home, and the expulsion of\r\ncorrupt men from office.\"[790]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 790: New York _Herald_, August 9, 1861.]\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to be expected, perhaps, that Dean Richmond and other\r\nrepresentatives of a great party would be willing, even if moved by no\r\nother motive than a love of country, to abandon a political\r\norganisation that had existed for years, and that had already shown\r\nits patriotism by the generous enlistment of its members; but it is\r\ndoubtful if they would have proclaimed, without the guidance of a\r\nState convention, such an elaborate and positive platform of\r\nprinciples, had not the serious defeat at Bull Run and the action of\r\nthe President in suspending the writ of _habeas corpus_, subjected the\r\nnational Administration to severe criticism. This, at least, was the\r\nview taken by the radical Republican press, which viciously attacked\r\nthe patriotism of Richmond and his associates, charging them with\r\nusing the livery of Democracy to serve the cause of treason.[791]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 791: New York _Tribune_, August 10.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these developments the Democratic State convention,\r\nmade up of a larger number of old men than usual, assembled at\r\nSyracuse on September 4. It was not an enthusiastic body. The division\r\nupon national affairs plainly had a depressing influence. Francis\r\nKernan became temporary chairman. At the Oneida bar, Kernan, then\r\nforty-five years old, had been for nearly two decades the peer of\r\nHiram Denio, Samuel Beardsley, Ward Hunt, and Joshua Spencer. He was a\r\nforceful speaker, cool and self-possessed, with a pleasing voice and\r\ngood manner. He could not be called an orator, but he was a master of\r\nthe art of making a perfectly clear statement, and in defending his\r\nposition, point by point, with never failing readiness and skill, he\r\nhad few if any superiors. He belonged, also, to that class of able\r\nlawyers who are never too busy to take an active interest in public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nIn his brief address Kernan clearly outlined the position which the\r\nDemocracy of the whole country was to occupy. \"It is our duty,\" he\r\nsaid, \"to oppose abolitionism at the North and secession at the South,\r\nwhich are equally making war upon our Government. Let us consign them\r\nboth to a common grave. Never will our country see peace unless we\r\ndo.... We care not what men are in charge of the Government, it is our\r\nduty as patriots and as Democrats to protect and preserve that\r\nGovernment, and resist with arms, and, if need be, with our lives, the\r\nmen who seek to overthrow it; but this must be no war for the\r\nemancipation of slaves.\"[792]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 792: New York _Tribune_, September 5, 1861.]\r\n\r\nThe vigor of Kernan as a speaker and presiding officer exaggerated by\r\ncontrast the feebleness of Herman J. Redfield, the permanent president\r\nof the convention. Redfield was an old man, a mere reminiscence of the\r\ndays of DeWitt Clinton, whose speech, read in a low, weak voice, was\r\ndirected mainly to a defence of the sub-treasury plan of 1840 and the\r\ntariff act of 1846.[793] He professed to favour a vigorous prosecution\r\nof the war, but there were no words of reprobation for its authors,\r\nwhile he expressed the belief that \"civil war will never preserve, but\r\nforever destroy the union of States.\" This was the prophecy of Reuben\r\nH. Walworth, the ex-chancellor, made at the Albany peace convention in\r\nthe preceding January, and the applause that greeted the statement\r\nthen, as it did at Syracuse, indicated a disposition on the part of\r\nmany to favour concessions that would excuse if it did not absolutely\r\njustify secession.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 793: \"From what lodge in some vast wilderness, from what lone\r\nmountain in the desert, the convention obtained its Rip Van Winkle\r\npresident, we are at a loss to conceive. He evidently has never heard\r\nof the Wilmot Proviso struggle of 1848, the compromise contest of\r\n1850, the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, the Lecompton constitution of\r\n1858, nor the presidential election of 1860. It is plain that he has\r\nnever even dreamed of the secession ordinances and of the fall of\r\nSumter.\"--New York _Tribune_, September 6, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"The speech of Mr. Redfield is universally laughed at. He has\r\ncompletely proven that he does not belong to the present century, or,\r\nat least, that he has been asleep for the last twenty years. Barnum\r\nshould deposit it among the curiosities of his shop.\"--New York\r\n_Herald_, September 5, 1861.]\r\n\r\nThe party platform, however, took little notice of the Redfield speech\r\nand the Redfield cheers. It declared that the right of secession did\r\nnot anywhere or at any time exist; that the seizure of United States\r\nproperty and the sending out of privateers to prey on American\r\ncommerce had precipitated the war; and that it was the duty of the\r\ngovernment to put down rebellion with all the means in its power, and\r\nthe duty of the people to rally about the government; but it also\r\ndemanded that Congress call a convention of all the States to revise\r\nthe Constitution, and that the Administration abandon the narrow\r\nplatform of the Chicago convention, expel corrupt men from office, and\r\nexclude advocates of abolition from the Cabinet, declaring that it\r\nwould \"regard any attempt to pervert the conflict into a war for the\r\nemancipation of slaves as fatal to the hope of restoring the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate upon the platform was destined to bring into prominence a\r\nbroader loyalty than even Francis Kernan had exhibited. Arphaxed\r\nLoomis moved to restore the resolution, expunged in the committee's\r\nreport, protesting against the passport system, the State police\r\nsystem, the suppression of free discussion in the press, and the\r\nsuspension of the writ of _habeas corpus_. It is doubtful if the\r\nfreedom of the press had been materially abridged, since restrictions\r\nupon a few newspapers, charged with giving aid and comfort to the\r\nenemy, scarcely exceeded the proscription of anti-slavery papers\r\nbefore the war. The suspension of the writ of _habeas corpus_,\r\nhowever, furnished better grounds for complaint. Men were apprehended,\r\noften on the telegram of Secretary Seward, and committed to prison,\r\nwithout any offence being charged or an examination being made. Among\r\nothers arrested were two men at Malone, besides an editor of the New\r\nYork _News_, and a crippled newsboy who sold the _News_. Public\r\nsentiment generally sustained the Administration in such action, but\r\nmany persons, including conservative Republicans, frequently\r\nquestioned the right or justice of such procedure. \"What are we coming\r\nto,\" asked Senator Trumbull of Illinois, \"if arrests may be made at\r\nthe whim or the caprice of a cabinet minister?\"[794] Loomis, in\r\ninsisting upon his resolution, had these arbitrary arrests in mind,\r\nmaintaining that it embodied the true principles of Democracy, which\r\nhe was unwilling to see violated without recording a protest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 794: \"Lieber says that _habeas corpus_, free meetings like\r\nthis, and a free press, are the three elements which distinguish\r\nliberty from despotism. All that Saxon blood has gained in the battles\r\nand toils of two hundred years are these three things. But to-day, Mr.\r\nChairman, every one of them is annihilated in every square mile of the\r\nrepublic. We live to-day, every one of us, under martial law. The\r\nSecretary of State puts into his bastille, with a warrant as\r\nirresponsible as that of Louis, any man whom he pleases. And you know\r\nthat neither press nor lips may venture to arraign the government\r\nwithout being silenced. At this moment at least one thousand men are\r\n'bastilled' by an authority as despotic as that of Louis, three times\r\nas many as Eldon and George III seized when they trembled for his\r\nthrone. For the first time on this continent we have passports, which\r\neven Louis Napoleon pronounces useless and odious. For the first time\r\nin our history government spies frequent our cities.\"--Lecture of\r\nWendell Phillips, delivered in New York, December, 1861.]\r\n\r\nThis brought to his feet Albert P. Laning of Buffalo. He was younger\r\nby a score of years than Loomis, and although never as prominent,\r\nperhaps, as the great advocate of legal reformative measures, his\r\nremarkable memory and thorough grasp of legal principles had listed\r\nhim among the strong lawyers of Western New York. To the convention he\r\nwas well known as a clear, forceful speaker, who had been a student of\r\npolitical history as well as of law, and who, in spite of his ardent\r\ndevotion to his profession, had revealed, when shaping the policy of\r\nhis party, the personal gifts and remarkable power of sustained\r\nargument that win admiration.\r\n\r\nAt Syracuse, in 1861, Laning, just then in his early forties, was in\r\nthe fulness of his intellectual power. He had followed Douglas and\r\nfavored the Crittenden Compromise, but the fall of Sumter crippled his\r\nsympathy for the South and stiffened his support of the Federal\r\nadministration. Moreover, he understood the difficulty, during a\r\nperiod of war, of conducting an impartial, constitutional opposition\r\nto the policy of the Administration, without its degeneration into a\r\nfaction, which at any moment might be shaken by interest, prejudice,\r\nor passion. The motion of Loomis, therefore, seemed to him too narrow,\r\nand he opposed it with eloquence, maintaining that it was the duty of\r\nall good men not to embarrass the Government in such a crisis. Rather\r\nthan that bold rebellion should destroy the government, he said, he\r\npreferred to allow the President to take his own course. The\r\nresponsibility was upon him, and the people, irrespective of party,\r\nshould strengthen his hands until danger had disappeared and the\r\ngovernment was re-established in all its strength.\r\n\r\nKernan did not take kindly to these sentiments. Like Loomis he\r\nresented arbitrary arrests in States removed from actual hostilities,\r\nwhere the courts were open for the regular administration of justice,\r\nand with a few ringing sentences he threw the delegates into wild\r\ncheering. Though brief, this speech resulted in restoring the Loomis\r\nresolution to its place in the platform, and in increasing the\r\nclamour that Kernan lead the party as a candidate for attorney-general.\r\nKernan was not averse to taking office. For three years, from 1856 to\r\n1859, he had been official reporter for the Court of Appeals, and in\r\n1860 served in the Assembly. Later, he entered Congress, finally\r\nreaching the United States Senate. But in 1861 prudence prompted him\r\nto decline the tempting offer of a nomination for attorney-general,\r\nand although entreated to reconsider his determination, he stubbornly\r\nresisted, and at last forced the nomination of Lyman Tremaine of\r\nAlbany, who had previously held the office.[795]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 795: The State ticket was made up as follows: Secretary of\r\nState, David R. Floyd Jones of Queens; Judge of the Court of Appeals,\r\nGeorge F. Comstock of Onondaga; Comptroller, George F. Scott of\r\nSaratoga; Attorney-General, Lyman Tremaine of Albany; Treasurer of\r\nState, Francis C. Brouck of Erie; Canal Commissioners, Jarvis B. Lord\r\nof Monroe, William W. Wright of Ontario; State Prison Director,\r\nWilliam C. Rhodes of New York.]\r\n\r\nThe work of the convention did not please all members of the party. To\r\nsome the drift of the speeches and resolutions seemed an encouragement\r\nto armed rebellion; to others, although jealous of individual rights,\r\nit appeared to confuse the liberty of the press with license. One\r\npaper, an able representative of the party, disclaiming any desire \"to\r\nrekindle animosities by discussing its various objectionable points,\"\r\nfelt \"bound to express its heartfelt repugnance of the malignant and\r\ntraitorous spirit which animates the Loomis resolution.\"[796] These\r\nwere severe words, showing that others than Laning opposed such\r\ncriticism of the President.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 796: New York _Leader_, September 9, 1861.]\r\n\r\nDean Richmond's refusal to unite in a Union convention did not stifle\r\nthe hope that many Democrats might participate in such a meeting, and\r\nto afford them an opportunity a People's convention met at Wieting\r\nHall in Syracuse, on September 11, contemporaneously with the\r\nRepublican State convention. It became evident that the purpose was\r\nattained when the Democrats present declared that the banner of their\r\nformer party no longer marked a place for them to muster. In character\r\nthe members resembled determined Abolitionists in the forties. Its\r\npresident, Thomas G. Alvord of Onondaga, had been speaker of the\r\nAssembly, a competitor of Gordon Granger for Congress, and a\r\npronounced Hard Shell until the repeal of the Missouri Compromise\r\ndrove him into the camp of the Softs. One of the delegates, James B.\r\nMcKean, was soon to lead the Sixty-seventh Regiment to the field;\r\nanother, Alexander S. Diven of Chemung was to enter Congress, and\r\nsubsequently to distinguish himself at Antietam and Chancellorsville\r\nat the head of the One Hundred and Seventh; other participants,\r\nconspicuous in their respective localities, were to suffer bitterly\r\nand struggle bravely to maintain the Union. One delegate sung the\r\n\"Star Spangled Banner,\" while the others, with radiant faces, broke\r\ninto cheers. This was followed by several brief and vigorous speeches\r\napproving the war and the methods by which it was conducted. \"There is\r\nno medium, no half way now,\" said one delegate, \"between patriots and\r\ntraitors.\"[797] This was the sentiment of the platform, which waived\r\nall political divisions and party traditions, declaring that the\r\nconvention sought only, in this hour of national peril, to proclaim\r\ndevotion to the Constitution and Union, and to defend and sustain the\r\nchosen authorities of the government at whatever cost of blood and\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 797: New York _Tribune_, September 10, 1861.]\r\n\r\nRumours of Daniel S. Dickinson's nomination had been in the air from\r\nthe outset. He had been much in the public eye since the 20th of\r\nApril. In his zeal for the Union, said the _Tribune_, \"his pointed\r\nutterances have everywhere fired the hearts of patriots.\" Freedom from\r\nthe blighting influence of slavery seemed to give him easier flight,\r\nand his criticism of the Democratic convention was so felicitous, so\r\nfull of story and wit and ridicule and the fire of genuine patriotism,\r\nthat his name was quickly upon every lip, and his happy, homely hits\r\nthe common property of half the people of the State.[798] The mention\r\nof his name for attorney-general, therefore, evoked the most\r\nenthusiastic applause. Since the constitutional convention of 1846 it\r\nhad been the custom, in the absence of a candidate for governor, to\r\nwrite the name of the nominee for secretary of state at the head of\r\nthe ticket; but in this instance the committee deemed it wise to\r\nnominate for attorney-general first and give it to the man of first\r\nimportance. The nomination proved a popular hit. Instantly Syracuse\r\nand the State were ablaze, and Republican as well as many Democratic\r\npapers prophesied that it settled the result in November. The\r\nconvention professed to discard party lines and traditions, and its\r\nsincerity, thus put early to the test, did much to magnify its work,\r\nsince with marked impartiality it placed upon its ticket two Hards,\r\ntwo Softs, one American, and four Republicans.[799]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 798: Dickinson's Ithaca speech, delivered the day after the\r\nDemocratic convention adjourned, is printed in full in the New York\r\n_Tribune_ of September 10, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 799: The ticket was as follows: Attorney-general, Daniel S.\r\nDickinson of Broome; Secretary of State, Horatio Ballard of Cortland;\r\nComptroller, Lucius Robinson of Chemung; Treasurer, William B. Lewis\r\nof Kings; Court of Appeals, William B. Wright, Sullivan; Canal\r\nCommissioners, Franklin A. Alberger of Erie and Benjamin F. Bruce of\r\nNew York; State Engineer, William B. Taylor of Oneida; State Prison\r\nInspector, Abram B. Tappan of Westchester.]\r\n\r\nWhenever the People's convention recessed delegates to the Republican\r\nconvention immediately took control. Indeed, so closely related were\r\nthe two assemblies that spectators at one became delegates to the\r\nother. Weed did not attend the convention, but it adopted his\r\nconciliatory policy. \"The popular fiat has gone forth in opposition,\r\non the one hand, to secession and disunion, whether in the shape of\r\nactive rebellion, or its more insidious ally, advocacy of an\r\ninglorious and dishonourable peace; and, on the other, to everything\r\nthat savors of abolition, or tends towards a violation of the\r\nguarantees of slave property provided by the Constitution.\"[800]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 800: New York _Herald_ (editorial), September 13, 1861.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the Democratic campaign opened under flattering\r\nconditions. Loomis' resolution, known as the ninth or \"secession\"\r\nplank, had led to serious difficulty. Men recognised that in time of\r\nwar more reserve was necessary in dealing with an Administration than\r\nduring a period of peace, for if the government's arm was paralysed it\r\ncould not stay the arm of the public enemy. This had been the position\r\nof Laning, and it appealed strongly to Lyman Tremaine, who believed\r\nthe machinations of treason had forced the Government to suspend the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_, and to organise systems of passports and\r\nState police. He boldly declined, therefore, to accept a nomination as\r\nattorney-general on a platform that emphatically condemned such\r\nmeasures, when deemed essential to the government's safety.\r\n\r\nTremaine, tall, portly, and commanding, belonged to the more\r\nindependent members of the party. He was not a stranger to public\r\nlife. Although but forty-two years old he had been an active party\r\nworker for a quarter of a century and an office-holder since his\r\nmajority. Greene County made him supervisor, district attorney, and\r\ncounty judge, and soon after his removal to Albany in 1854 he became\r\nattorney-general. But these honours did not break his independence. He\r\ninherited a genius for the forum, and although his gifts did not put\r\nhim into the first class, his name was familiar throughout the State.\r\n\r\nFrancis C. Brouck's withdrawal soon followed Tremaine's.[801] Then\r\nTammany repudiated the Loomis resolutions,[802] and the Albany _Argus_\r\nshouted lustily for war.[803] But the blow that staggered Richmond came\r\nfrom the candidates who caught the drift of public sentiment, and in a\r\nproclamation of few words declared \"in favour of vigorously sustaining\r\nthe Government in its present struggle to maintain the Constitution\r\nand the Union, at all hazards, and at any cost of blood and\r\ntreasure.\"[804] This was the act of despair. For days they had waited,\r\nand now, alarmed by the evident change, they jumped from the plank\r\nthat was sinking under them. \"It is the first instance on record,\"\r\nsaid the _Herald_, \"where the nominees of a convention openly and\r\ndefiantly spit upon the platform, and repudiated party leaders and\r\ntheir secession heresies.\"[805]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 801: Marshal M. Champlain of Allegany and William Williams of\r\nErie were substituted for Tremaine and Brouck.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 802: New York _Tribune_, October 4, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 803: November 6, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 804: New York _Herald_, October 23, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 805: _Ibid._, October 23, 1861.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the difference between the great mass of Democrats and\r\nthe supporters of the People's party was more apparent than real.[806]\r\nEach professed undying devotion to the Union. Each, also, favoured a\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war. As the campaign advanced the activity\r\nof the army strengthened this loyalty and minimised the criticism of\r\nharsh methods. Moreover, the impression obtained that the war would\r\nsoon be over.[807] McClellan was in command, and the people had not yet\r\nlearned that \"our chicken was no eagle, after all,\" as Lowell\r\nexpressed it.[808] Controversy over the interference with slavery also\r\nbecame less acute. John Cochrane, now commanding a regiment at the\r\nfront, declared, in a speech to his soldiers, that slaves of the\r\nenemy, being elements of strength, ought to be captured as much as\r\nmuskets or cannon, and that whenever he could seize a slave, and even\r\narm him to fight for the government, he would do so.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 806: \"There are sympathisers with the secessionists still\r\nremaining in the Democratic ranks, but they compose a small portion of\r\nthe party. Nine-tenths of it is probably strenuous in the\r\ndetermination that the constitutional authority of the government\r\nshall be maintained and enforced without compromise. This sentiment is\r\nfar more prevalent and decided than it was two months ago.\"--New York\r\n_Tribune_, November 19, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 807: \"I have now no doubt this causeless and most flagitious\r\nrebellion is to be put down much sooner than many, myself included,\r\nthought practicable.\"--Edwin Croswell, letter in New York _Tribune_,\r\nNovember 25, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 808: Political Essays, p. 94.--_North American Review_,\r\nApril, 1864.]\r\n\r\nIn conducting the campaign the People's leaders discountenanced any\r\ncriticism of the Government's efforts to restore the Union. \"It is not\r\nLincoln and the Republicans we are sustaining,\" wrote Daniel S.\r\nDickinson. \"They have nothing to do with it. It is the government of\r\nour fathers, worth just as much as if it was administered by Andrew\r\nJackson. There is but one side to it.\"[809] As a rule the Hards\r\naccepted this view, and at the ratification of the ticket in New York,\r\non September 20, Lyman Tremaine swelled the long list of speakers. A\r\nletter was also read from Greene C. Bronson. To those who heard James\r\nT. Brady at Cooper Institute on the evening of October 28 he seemed\r\ninspired. His piercing eyes burned in their sockets, and his animated\r\nface, now pale with emotion, expressed more than his emphatic words\r\nthe loathing felt for men who had plunged their country into bloody\r\nstrife.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 809: Daniel S. Dickinson's _Life, Letters, and Speeches_,\r\nVol. 2, pp. 550-551.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it remained for Daniel S. Dickinson to stigmatise the\r\nDemocratic party. At the Union Square meeting he had burned his\r\nbridges. It was said he had nowhere else to go; that the Hards went\r\nout of business when the South went out of the Union; and that to the\r\nSofts he was _non persona grata_. There was much truth in this\r\nstatement. But having once become a Radical his past affiliations gave\r\nhim some advantages. For more than twenty years he had been known\r\nthroughout the State as a Southern sympathiser. In the United States\r\nSenate he stood with the South for slavery, and in the election of\r\n1860 he voted for Breckinridge. He was the most conspicuous doughface\r\nin New York. Now, he was an advocate of vigorous war and a pronounced\r\nsupporter of President Lincoln. This gave him the importance of a new\r\nconvert at a camp meeting. The people believed he knew what he was\r\ntalking about, and while his stories and apt illustrations, enriched\r\nby a quick change in voice and manner, convulsed his audiences,\r\nimbedded in his wit and rollicking fun were most convincing arguments\r\nwhich appealed to the best sentiments of his hearers.[810] Indeed, it\r\nis not too much to say that Daniel S. Dickinson, as an entertaining\r\nand forceful platform speaker, filled the place in 1861 which John Van\r\nBuren occupied in the Free-soil campaign in 1848.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 810: \"I have just finished a second reading of your speech in\r\nWyoming County, and with so much pleasure and admiration that I cannot\r\nrefrain from thanking you. It is a speech worthy of an American\r\nstatesman, and will command the attention of the country by its high\r\nand generous patriotism, no less than by its eloquence and\r\npower.\"--Letter of John K. Porter of Albany to D.S. Dickinson, August\r\n23, 1861. _Dickinson's Life, Letters, and Speeches_, Vol. 2, p. 553.\r\nSimilar letters were written by Henry W. Rogers of Buffalo, William H.\r\nSeward, Dr. N. Niles, and others.--_Ibid._, pp. 555, 559, 561.]\r\n\r\nA single address by Horatio Seymour, delivered at Utica on October 28,\r\nproved his right to speak for the Democratic party. He had a difficult\r\ntask to perform. Men had changed front in a day, and to one of his\r\nviews, holding rebellion as a thing to be crushed without impairing\r\nexisting conditions, it seemed imperative to divorce \"revolutionary\r\nemancipators\" from the conservative patriots who loved their country\r\nas it was. He manifested a desire to appear scrupulously loyal to the\r\nGovernment, counseling obedience to constituted authorities, respect\r\nfor constitutional obligations, and a just and liberal support of the\r\nPresident, in whose favour every presumption should be given. The\r\nsuspension of the writ of _habeas corpus_ and the long list of\r\narbitrary arrests had provoked Seymour as it did many conservative\r\nRepublicans, but however much individual rights may be violated, he\r\nsaid, so long as the country is engaged in a struggle for its\r\nexistence, confidence, based upon the assumption that imperative\r\nreasons exist for these unusual measures, must be reposed in the\r\nAdministration. This was the incarnation of loyalty.\r\n\r\nBut Seymour closed his address with an ugly crack of the whip.\r\nDropping his well-selected words with the skill of a practised\r\ndebater, he blended the history of past wrongs with those of the\r\npresent, thus harrowing his auditors into a frame of mind as\r\nresentful and passionate as his own. When the public safety permits,\r\nhe said threateningly, there will be abundant time to condemn and\r\npunish the authors of injustice and wrong, whether they occupy the\r\npresidential chair or seats in the cabinet. \"Let them remember the\r\nteachings of history. Despotic governments do not love the agitators\r\nthat call them into existence. When Cromwell drove from Parliament the\r\nlatter-day saints and higher-law men of his day, and 'bade them cease\r\ntheir babblings;' and when Napoleon scattered at the point of the\r\nbayonet the Council of Five Hundred and crushed revolution beneath his\r\niron heel, they taught a lesson which should be heeded this day by men\r\nwho are animated by a vindictive piety or a malignant philanthropy....\r\nIt is the boast of the Briton that his house is his castle. However\r\nhumble it may be, the King cannot enter. Let it not be said that the\r\nliberties of American citizens are less perfectly protected, or held\r\nless sacred than are those of the subjects of a Crown.\"\r\n\r\nThe slavery question was less easily and logically handled. He denied\r\nthat it caused the war, but admitted that the agitators did, putting\r\ninto the same class \"the ambitious man at the South, who desired a\r\nseparate confederacy,\" and \"the ambitious men of the North, who reaped\r\na political profit from agitation.\" In deprecating emancipation he\r\ncarefully avoided the argument of military necessity, so forcibly put\r\nby John Cochrane, and strangely overlooked the fact that the South, by\r\nthe act of rebellion, put itself outside the protection guaranteed\r\nunder the Constitution to loyal and law-abiding citizens. \"If it be\r\ntrue,\" he said, \"that slavery must be abolished to save this Union,\r\nthen the people of the South should be allowed to withdraw themselves\r\nfrom the Government which cannot give them the protection guaranteed\r\nby its terms.\" Immediate emancipation, he continued, would not end the\r\ncontest. \"It would be only the commencement of a lasting, destructive,\r\nterrible domestic conflict. The North would not consent that four\r\nmillions of free negroes should live in their midst.... With what\r\njustice do we demand that the South should be subjected to the evils,\r\nthe insecurity, and the loss of constitutional rights, involved in\r\nimmediate abolition?\" Then, dropping into prophecy, the broad,\r\noptimistic statesmanship of the forties passed into eclipse as he\r\ndeclared that \"we are either to be restored to our former position,\r\nwith the Constitution unweakened, the powers of the State unimpaired,\r\nand the fireside rights of our citizens duly protected, or our whole\r\nsystem of government is to fall!\"\r\n\r\nSeymour, in closing, very clearly outlined his future platform. \"We\r\nare willing to support this war as a means of restoring our Union, but\r\nwe will not carry it on in a spirit of hatred, malice, or revenge. We\r\ncannot, therefore, make it a war for the abolition of slavery. We will\r\nnot permit it to be made a war upon the rights of the States. We shall\r\nsee that it does not crush out the liberties of the citizen, or the\r\nreserved powers of the States. We shall hold that man to be as much a\r\ntraitor who urges our government to overstep its constitutional\r\npowers, as he who resists the exercise of its rightful authority. We\r\nshall contend that the rights of the States and the General Government\r\nare equally sacred.\"[811]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 811: _Public Record of Horatio Seymour_, pp. 32-43.]\r\n\r\nIf the campaign contributed to the South a certain degree of comfort,\r\nreviving the hope that it would yet have a divided North to contend\r\nagainst, the election, giving Dickinson over 100,000 majority,\r\nfurnished little encouragement. The People's party also carried both\r\nbranches of the Legislature, securing twenty out of thirty-two\r\nsenators, and seventy out of the one hundred and twenty-eight\r\nassemblymen. Among the latter, Henry J. Raymond and Thomas G. Alvord,\r\nformer speakers, represented the undaunted mettle needed at Albany.\r\n\r\nTo add to the result so gratifying to the fusionists, George Opdyke\r\ndefeated Fernando Wood by a small plurality for mayor of New York.\r\nWood had long been known as a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He talked\r\nreform and grew degenerate; he proclaimed patriotic views and held\r\ndisloyal sentiments; he listened respectfully to public opinion, and\r\ndefied it openly in his acts. He did not become a boss. It was ten\r\nyears later before William M. Tweed centralised Tammany's power in one\r\nman. But Wood developed the system that made a boss possible. He\r\ndominated the police, he organised the lawless, he allied himself with\r\nthe saloon, and he used the judiciary. In 1858, being forced out of\r\nTammany, he retreated like a wounded tiger to Mozart Hall, organised\r\nan opposition society that took its name from the assembly room in\r\nwhich it met, and declared with emphasis and expletives that he would\r\nfight Tammany as long as he lived. From that moment his shadow had\r\nkept sachems alarmed, and his presence had thrown conventions into\r\nturmoil.\r\n\r\nThe arts of the card-sharper and thimble-rigger had been prodigally\r\nemployed to save the candidate of Mozart Hall. Even the sachems of\r\nTammany, to avert disaster, nominated James T. Brady, whose great\r\npopularity it was believed would draw strength from both Opdyke and\r\nWood; but Brady refused to be used. Opdyke had been a liberal,\r\nprogressive Democrat of the Free-Soil type and a pioneer Republican.\r\nHe associated with Chase in the Buffalo convention of 1848 and\r\ncoöperated with Greeley in defeating Seward in 1860. He had also\r\nenjoyed the career of a busy and successful merchant, and, although\r\nfifty years old, was destined to take a prominent part in municipal\r\npolitics for the next two decades. One term in the Assembly summed up\r\nhis office-holding experience; yet in that brief and uneventful period\r\njobbers learned to shun him and rogues to fear him. This was one\r\nreason why the brilliant and audacious leader of Mozart Hall, in his\r\ndeath struggle with an honest man, suddenly assumed to be the champion\r\nof public purity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\"THE MAD DESPERATION OF REACTION\"\r\n\r\n1862\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its confidence in General McClellan, whose success in\r\nWest Virginia had made him the successor of General Scott, giving him\r\ncommand of all the United States forces, the North, by midsummer,\r\nbecame profoundly discouraged. Many events contributed to it. The\r\ndefeat at Ball's Bluff on the Potomac, which Roscoe Conkling likened\r\nto the battle of Cannæ, because \"the very pride and flower of our\r\nyoung men were among its victims,\"[812] had been followed by\r\nconspicuous incompetence at Manassas and humiliating failure on the\r\nPeninsula. Moreover, financial difficulties increased the despondency.\r\nAt the outbreak of hostilities practical repudiation of Southern debts\r\nhad brought widespread disaster. \"The fabric of New York's mercantile\r\nprosperity,\" said the _Tribune_, \"lies in ruins, beneath which ten\r\nthousand fortunes are buried. Last fall the merchant was a capitalist;\r\nto-day he is a bankrupt.\"[813] In September, 1861, these losses\r\naggregated $200,000,000.[814] Besides, the strain of raising sufficient\r\nfunds to meet government expenses had forced a suspension of specie\r\npayment and driven people to refuse United States notes payable on\r\ndemand without interest. Meantime, the nation's expenses aggregated\r\n$2,000,000 a day and the Treasury was empty. \"I have been obliged,\"\r\nwrote the Secretary of the Treasury, \"to draw for the last installment\r\nof the November loan.\"[815]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 812: _Congressional Globe_, January 6, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 813: New York _Tribune_, May 27, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 814: _Ibid._, September 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 815: Letter of Secretary Chase, dated February 3, 1862.--E.G.\r\nSpaulding, _History of the Legal Tender_, p. 59.]\r\n\r\nTo meet this serious financial condition, Elbridge G. Spaulding of\r\nBuffalo, then a member of Congress, had been designated to prepare an\r\nemergency measure to avoid national bankruptcy. \"We must have at least\r\n$100,000,000 during the next three months,\" he wrote, on January 8,\r\n1862, \"or the government must stop payment.\"[816] Spaulding, then\r\nfifty-two years of age, was president of a bank, a trained financier,\r\nand already the possessor of a large fortune. Having served in the\r\nThirty-first Congress, he had returned in 1859, after an absence of\r\neight years, to remain four years longer. Strong, alert, and\r\nsufficiently positive to be stubborn, he possessed the confidence of\r\nThaddeus Stevens, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who\r\napproved his plan of issuing $100,000,000 legal-tender, non-interest\r\nbearing treasury notes, exchangeable at par for six-twenty bonds.\r\nSpaulding fully appreciated the objections to his policy, but the only\r\nother course, he argued, was to sell bonds as in the war of 1812,\r\nwhich, if placed at six percent interest, would not, in his opinion,\r\nbring more than sixty cents--a ruinous method of conducting\r\nhostilities. However, his plea of necessity found a divided committee\r\nand in Roscoe Conkling a most formidable opponent, who attacked the\r\nmeasure as unnecessary, extravagant, unsound, without precedent, of\r\ndoubtful constitutionality, and morally imperfect.[817]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 816: Spaulding, _History of the Legal Tender_, p. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 817: The bill escaped from the committee by one majority.]\r\n\r\nIt was in this debate that Conkling, adroitly choosing the right time\r\nand the proper subject, impressed the country with his power as an\r\norator and his ability as a brilliant, resourceful debater, although,\r\nperhaps, a destructive rather than constructive legislator. Nature had\r\nlavished upon him superb gifts of mind and person. He was of\r\ncommanding, even magnificent presence, six feet three inches tall,\r\nwith regular features, lofty forehead, and piercing eyes,--blond and\r\ngigantic as a viking. It was difficult, indeed, for a man so\r\nsuperlatively handsome not to be vain, and the endeavour upon his part\r\nto conceal the defect was not in evidence. Although an unpopular and\r\nunruly schoolboy, who refused to go to college, he had received a good\r\neducation, learning much from a scholarly father, a college-bred man,\r\nand an ornament to the United States District Court for more than a\r\nquarter of a century. Moreover, from early youth Conkling had studied\r\nelocution, training a strong, slightly musical voice, and learning the\r\nuse of secondary accents, the choice of words, the value of deliberate\r\nspeech, and the assumption of an impressive earnestness. In this\r\ndebate, too, he discovered the talent for ridicule and sarcasm that\r\ndistinguished him in later life, when he had grown less considerate of\r\nthe feelings of opponents, and indicated something of the\r\nimperiousness and vanity which clouded an otherwise attractive manner.\r\n\r\nAs he stubbornly and eloquently contested the progress of the\r\nlegal-tender measure with forceful argument and a wealth of\r\ninformation, Conkling seemed likely to deprive Spaulding of the title\r\nof \"father of the greenback\" until the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ndriven to desperation for want of money, reluctantly came to the\r\nCongressman's rescue and forced the bill through Congress.[818] By\r\nmidsummer, however, gold had jumped to seventeen per cent., while the\r\ncost of the war, augmented by a call for 300,000 three years' men and\r\nby a draft of 300,000 nine months' militia, rested more heavily than\r\never upon the country. Moreover, by September 1 McClellan had been\r\ndeprived of his command, the Army of the Potomac had suffered defeat\r\nat the second battle of Bull Run, and Lee and Longstreet, with a\r\nvictorious army, were on their way to Maryland. The North stood\r\naghast!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 818: On Spaulding's motion to close debate, Conkling demanded\r\ntellers, and the motion was lost,--yeas, 52; nays, 62.--_Congressional\r\nGlobe_, February 5, 1862; _Ibid._, p. 618.]\r\n\r\nMuch more ominous than military disaster and financial embarrassment,\r\nhowever, was the divisive sentiment over emancipation. Northern\r\narmies, moving about in slave communities, necessarily acted as a\r\nconstant disintegrating force. Slaves gave soldiers aid and\r\ninformation, and soldiers, stimulated by their natural hostility to\r\nslave-owners, gave slaves protection and sympathy. Thus, very early in\r\nthe war, many men believed that rebellion and slavery were so\r\nintertwined that both must be simultaneously overthrown. This\r\nsentiment found expression in the Fremont proclamation, issued on\r\nAugust 30, 1861, setting free all slaves owned by persons who aided\r\nsecession in the military department of Missouri. On the other hand,\r\nthe Government, seeking to avoid the slavery question, encouraged\r\nmilitary commanders to refuse refuge to the negroes within their\r\nlines, and in modifying Fremont's order to conform to the Confiscation\r\nAct of August 6, the President aroused a discussion characterised by\r\nincreasing acerbity, which divided the Republican party into Radicals\r\nand Conservatives. The former, led by the _Tribune_, resented the\r\nattitude of army officers, who, it charged, being notoriously in more\r\nor less thorough sympathy with the inciting cause of rebellion, failed\r\nto seize opportunities to strike at slavery. Among Radicals the belief\r\nobtained that one half of the commanding generals desired to prosecute\r\nthe war so delicately that slavery should receive the least possible\r\nharm, and in their comments in Congress and in the press they made no\r\nconcealment of their opinion, that such officers were much more\r\nanxious to restore fugitive slaves to rebel owners than to make their\r\nowners prisoners of war.[819] They were correspondingly flattering to\r\nthose generals who proclaimed abolition as an adjunct of the war.\r\nGreeley's taunts had barbed points. \"He is no extemporised soldier,\r\nlooking for a presidential nomination or seat in Congress,\" he said of\r\nGeneral Hunter, whose order had freed the slaves in South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, and Florida. \"He is neither a political or civil engineer,\r\nbut simply a patriot whose profession is war, and who does not\r\nunderstand making war so as not to hurt your enemy.\"[820]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 819: New York _Tribune_, July 30, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 820: _Ibid._, August 4.]\r\n\r\nWhen the _Times_, an exponent of the Conservatives, defended the\r\nAdministration's policy with the declaration that slaves were used as\r\nfast as obtained,[821] the _Tribune_ minimized the intelligence of its\r\neditor. \"Consider,\" it said, \"the still unmodified order of McDowell,\r\nissued a full year ago, forbidding the harbouring of negroes within\r\nour lines. Consider Halleck's order, now nine months old and still\r\noperative, forbidding negroes to come within our lines at all.\r\nMcClellan has issued a goodly number of orders and proclamations, but\r\nnot one of them offers protection and freedom to such slaves of rebels\r\nas might see fit to claim them at his hands. His only order bearing\r\nupon their condition and prospects is that which expelled the\r\nHutchinsons from his camp for the crime of singing anti-slavery\r\nsongs.\"[822]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 821: New York _Times_, July 17, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 822: New York _Tribune_, July 19, 1862.]\r\n\r\nThe dominant sentiment in Congress reflected the feeling of the\r\nRadicals, and under the pressure of McClellan's reverses before\r\nRichmond, the House, on July 11, and the Senate on the following day,\r\npassed the Confiscation Act, freeing forever the slaves of rebel\r\nowners whenever within control of the Government. The Administration's\r\nfailure to enforce this act in the spirit and to the extent that\r\nCongress intended, finally brought out the now historic \"Prayer of\r\nTwenty Millions\"--an editorial signed by Horace Greeley and addressed\r\nto Abraham Lincoln. It charged the President with being disastrously\r\nremiss in the discharge of his official duty and unduly influenced by\r\nthe menaces of border slave State politicians. It declared that the\r\nUnion was suffering from timid counsels and mistaken deference to\r\nrebel slavery; that all attempts to put down rebellion and save\r\nslavery are preposterous and futile; and that every hour of obeisance\r\nto slavery is an added hour of deepened peril to the Union. In\r\nconclusion, he entreated the Chief Executive to render hearty and\r\nunequivocal obedience to the law of the land.[823]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 823: _Ibid._, August 20.\r\n\r\nLincoln's reply appeared in the _National Intelligencer_ of\r\nWashington. He said in part: \"I would save the Union. If there be\r\nthose who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time\r\nsave slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would\r\nnot save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery,\r\nI do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to\r\nsave the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I\r\ncould save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if\r\nI could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I\r\ncould save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would do\r\nthat. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I\r\nbelieve it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear\r\nbecause I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do\r\nless whenever I believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall\r\ndo more when I shall believe doing more will help the cause.\"--_Lincoln's\r\nWorks_, Vol. 2, p. 227.]\r\n\r\nThus did Greeley devote his great powers to force Lincoln into\r\nemancipation. It is impossible, even at this distance of time, to turn\r\nthe pages of his ponderous volumes without feeling the matchless force\r\nof his energy, the strength of his masterly array of facts, his biting\r\nsarcasm, his bold assumptions, and his clear, unadorned style. There\r\nis about it all an impassioned conviction, as if he spoke because he\r\ncould not keep silent, making it impossible to avoid the belief that\r\nthe whole soul and conscience of the writer were in his work. Day\r\nafter day, with kaleidoscopic change, he marshalled arguments, facts,\r\nand historical parallels, bearing down the reader's judgment as he\r\nswept away like a great torrent the criticisms of himself and the\r\narguments of his opponents. Nothing apparently could withstand his\r\nonslaught on slavery. With one dash of his pen he forged sentences\r\nthat, lance-like, found their way into every joint of the monster's\r\narmour.\r\n\r\nGreeley's criticism of the President and the army, however, gave his\r\nenemies vantage ground for renewed attacks. Ever since he suggested,\r\nat the beginning of hostilities, that the _Herald_ did not care which\r\nflag floated over its office, James Gordon Bennett, possessing the\r\ngenuine newspaper genius, had daily evinced a deep, personal dislike\r\nof the _Tribune's_ editor, and throughout the discussion of\r\nemancipation, the _Herald_, in bitter editorials, kept its columns in\r\na glow, tantalising the _Tribune_ with a persistency that recalls\r\nCheetham's attacks upon Aaron Burr. The strategical advantage lay with\r\nthe _Herald_, since the initiative belonged to the _Tribune_, but the\r\nlatter had with it the preponderating sentiment of its party and the\r\ngrowing influence of a war necessity. Greeley fought with a\r\nbroad-sword, swinging it with a vigorous and well-aimed effect, while\r\nBennett, with lighter weapon, pricked, stabbed, and cut. Never\r\ninactive, the latter sought to aggravate and embitter. Greeley, on the\r\ncontrary, intent upon forcing the Administration to change its policy,\r\nignored his tormentor, until exasperation, like the gathering steam in\r\na geyser, drove him into further action. In this prolonged controversy\r\nthe _Tribune_ invariably referred to its adversary as \"the _Herald_,\"\r\nbut in the _Herald_, \"Greeley,\" \"old Greeley,\" \"poor Greeley,\" \"Mars\r\nGreeley,\" \"poor crazy Greeley,\" became synonyms for the editor of the\r\n_Tribune_.\r\n\r\nThe fight of these able and conspicuous journals represented the\r\nfierceness with which emancipation was pushed and opposed throughout\r\nthe State. Conservative men, therefore, realising the danger to which\r\na bitter campaign along strict party lines would subject the Union\r\ncause, demanded that all parties rally to the support of the\r\nGovernment with a candidate for governor devoted to conservative\r\nprinciples and a vigorous prosecution of the war. Sentiment seemed to\r\npoint to John A. Dix as such a man. Though not distinguished as a\r\nstrategist or effective field officer, he possessed courage, caution,\r\nand a desire to crush the rebellion. The policy of this movement,\r\nembracing conservative Republicans and war Democrats, was urged by\r\nThurlow Weed, sanctioned by Seward, and heartily approved by John Van\r\nBuren, who, since the beginning of hostilities, had avoided party\r\ncouncils. The Constitutional Union party, composed of old line Whigs\r\nwho opposed emancipation,[824] proposed to lead this movement at its\r\nconvention, to be held at Troy on September 9, but at the appointed\r\ntime James Brooks, by prearrangement, appeared with a file of\r\ninstructed followers, captured the meeting, and gave Horatio Seymour\r\n32 votes to 20 for Dix and 6 for Millard Fillmore. This unexpected\r\nresult made Seymour the candidate of the Democratic State convention\r\nwhich met at Albany on the following day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 824: New York _Herald_, October 15, 1862.]\r\n\r\nSeymour sincerely preferred another. Early in August he travelled from\r\nUtica to Buffalo to resist the friendship and the arguments of Dean\r\nRichmond. It cannot be said that he had outlived ambition. He\r\npossessed wealth, he was advancing in his political career, and he\r\naspired to higher honours, but he did not desire to become governor\r\nagain, even though the party indicated a willingness to follow his\r\nleadership and give him free rein to inaugurate such a policy as his\r\nwisdom and conservatism might dictate. He clearly recognised the\r\ndifficulties in the way. He had taken ultra ground against the Federal\r\nAdministration, opposing emancipation, denouncing arbitrary arrests,\r\nand expressing the belief that the North could not subjugate the\r\nSouth; yet he would be powerless to give life to his own views, or to\r\nmodify Lincoln's proposed conduct of the war. The President, having\r\nbeen elected to serve until March, 1865, would not tolerate\r\ninterference with his plans and purposes, so that an opposition\r\nGovernor, regardless of grievances or their cause, would be compelled\r\nto furnish troops and to keep the peace. Hatred of conscription would\r\nbe no excuse for non-action in case of a draft riot, and indignation\r\nover summary arrests could in nowise limit the exercise of such\r\narbitrary methods. To be governor under such conditions, therefore,\r\nmeant constant embarrassment, if not unceasing humiliation. These\r\nreasons were carefully presented to Richmond. Moreover, Seymour was\r\nconscious of inherent defects of temperament. He did not belong to the\r\nclass of politicians, described by Victor Hugo, who mistake a\r\nweather-cock for a flag. He was a gentleman of culture, of public\r\nexperience, and of moral purpose, representing the best quality of his\r\nparty; but possessed of a sensitive and eager temper, he was too often\r\ninfluenced by the men immediately about him, and too often inclined\r\nto have about him men whose influence did not strengthen his own\r\nbetter judgment.\r\n\r\nRichmond knew of this weakness and regretted it, but the man of iron,\r\ngrasping the political situation with the shrewdness of a phenomenally\r\nsuccessful business man, wanted a candidate who could win. It was\r\nplain to him that the Republican party, divided on the question of\r\nemancipation and weakened by arbitrary arrests, a policy that many\r\npeople bitterly resented, could be beaten by a candidate who added\r\nexceptional popularity to a promised support of the war and a vigorous\r\nprotest against government methods. Dix, he knew, would stand with the\r\nPresident; Seymour would criticise, and with sureness of aim arouse\r\nopposition. While Richmond, therefore, listened respectfully to\r\nSeymour's reasons for declining the nomination, he was deaf to all\r\nentreaty, insisting that as the party had honoured him when he wanted\r\noffice, he must now honour the party when it needed him. Besides, he\r\ndeclared that Sanford E. Church, whom Seymour favoured, could not be\r\nelected.[825] Having gained the Oneidan's consent, Richmond exercised\r\nhis adroit methods of packing conventions, and thus opened the way for\r\nSeymour's unanimous nomination by making the Constitutional Union\r\nconvention the voice of one crying in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 825: The author is indebted to Henry A. Richmond, son of Dean\r\nRichmond, for this outline of Seymour's interview.]\r\n\r\nTo a majority of the Democratic party Seymour's selection appealed\r\nwith something of historic pride. It recalled other days in the\r\nbeginning of his career, and inspired the hope that the peace which\r\nreigned in the fifties, and the power that the Democracy then wielded,\r\nmight, under his leadership, again return to bless their party by\r\nchecking a policy that was rapidly introducing a new order of things.\r\nAfter his nomination, therefore, voices became hoarse with long\r\ncontinued cheering. For a few minutes the assembly surrendered to the\r\nnoise and confusion which characterise a more modern convention, and\r\nonly the presence of the nominee and the announcement that he would\r\nspeak brought men to order.\r\n\r\nSeymour, as was his custom, came carefully prepared. In his party he\r\nnow had no rival. Not since DeWitt Clinton crushed the Livingstons in\r\n1807, and Martin Van Buren swept the State in 1828, did one man so\r\ncompletely dominate a political organisation, and in his arraignment\r\nof the Radicals he emulated the partisan rather than the patriot. He\r\nspoke respectfully of the President, insisting that he should \"be\r\ntreated with the respect due to his position as the representative of\r\nthe dignity and honor of the American people,\" and declaring that\r\n\"with all our powers of mind and person, we mean to support the\r\nConstitution and uphold the Union;\" but in his bitter denunciation of\r\nthe Administration he confused the general policy of conducting a war\r\nwith mistakes in awarding government contracts. To him an honest\r\ndifference of opinion upon constitutional questions was as corrupt and\r\nreprehensible as dishonest practices in the departments at Washington.\r\nHe condemned emancipation as \"a proposal for the butchery of women and\r\nchildren, for scenes of lust and rapine, and of arson and murder,\r\nwhich would invoke the interference of civilised Europe.\"[826]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 826: Cook and Knox, _Public Record of Horatio Seymour_, pp.\r\n45-58.]\r\n\r\nThe convention thought seriously of making this speech the party\r\nplatform. But A.P. Laning, declining to surrender the prerogative of\r\nthe resolutions committee, presented a brief statement of principles,\r\n\"pledging the Democracy to continue united in its support of the\r\nGovernment, and to use all legitimate means to suppress rebellion,\r\nrestore the Union as it was, and maintain the Constitution as it is.\"\r\nIt also denounced \"the illegal, unconstitutional, and arbitrary\r\narrests of citizens of the State as unjustifiable,\" declaring such\r\narrests a usurpation and a crime, and insisting upon the liberty of\r\nspeech and the freedom of the press.[827]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 827: The ticket nominated was as follows: Governor, Horatio\r\nSeymour of Oneida; Lieutenant-Governor, David E. Floyd Jones of\r\nQueens; Canal Commissioner, William I. Skinner of Herkimer; Prison\r\nInspector, Gaylord J. Clark of Niagara; Clerk of Appeals, Fred A.\r\nTallmadge of New York.]\r\n\r\nThe speech of Seymour, as displeasing to many War Democrats as it was\r\nsatisfactory to the Peace faction, at once aroused conservative\r\nRepublicans, and Weed and Raymond, backed by Seward, favored the\r\npolicy of nominating John A. Dix. Seward had distinguished himself as\r\none of the more conservative members of the Cabinet. After settling\r\ninto the belief that Lincoln \"is the best of us\"[828] his ambition\r\ncentered in the support of the President, and whatever aid he could\r\nrender in helping the country to a better understanding of the\r\nAdministration's aims and wishes was generously if not always adroitly\r\nperformed. He did not oppose the abolition of slavery. On the\r\ncontrary, his clear discernment exhibited its certain destruction if\r\nthe rebellion continued; but he opposed blending emancipation with a\r\nprosecution of the war, preferring to meet the former as the necessity\r\nfor it arose rather than precipitate an academic discussion which\r\nwould divide Republicans and give the Democrats an issue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 828: Seward to his wife.--F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_,\r\nVol. 2, p. 590.]\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln, on July 22, 1862, announced to his Cabinet a\r\ndetermination to issue an emancipation proclamation, the Secretary\r\nquestioned its expediency only as to the time of its publication. \"The\r\ndepression of the public mind consequent upon our repeated reverses,\"\r\nhe said, \"is so great that I fear the effect of so important a\r\nstep.... I suggest, sir, that you postpone its issue until you can\r\ngive it to the country supported by military success, instead of\r\nissuing it, as would be the case now, upon the greatest disasters of\r\nthe war.\"[829] Seward's view was adopted, and in place of the\r\nproclamation appeared the Executive Order of July 22, the\r\nunenforcement of which Greeley had so fiercely criticised in his\r\n\"Prayer of Twenty Millions.\" Thurlow Weed, who, in June, had returned\r\nfrom London heavily freighted with good results for the Union\r\naccomplished by his influence with leading Englishmen, held the\r\nopinion of Seward. Raymond had also made the _Times_ an able defender\r\nof the President's policy, and although not violent in its opposition\r\nto the attitude of the Radicals, it never ceased its efforts to\r\nsuppress agitation of the slavery question.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 829: Frank B. Carpenter, _Six Months at the White House_, pp.\r\n22, 23.]\r\n\r\nIn its purpose to nominate Dix the New York _Herald_ likewise bore a\r\nconspicuous part. It had urged his selection upon the Democrats,\r\ndeclaring him stronger than Seymour. It now urged him upon the\r\nRepublicans, insisting that he was stronger than Wadsworth.[830] This\r\nwas also the belief of Weed, whose sagacity as to the strength of\r\npolitical leaders was rarely at fault.[831] On the contrary, Governor\r\nMorgan expressed the opinion that \"Wadsworth will be far more\r\navailable than any one yet mentioned as my successor.\"[832] Wadsworth's\r\nservice at the battle of Bull Run had been distinguished. \"Gen.\r\nMcDowell told us on Monday,\" wrote Thurlow Weed, \"that Major Wadsworth\r\nrendered him the most important service before, during, and after\r\nbattle. From others we have learned that after resisting the stampede,\r\nearnestly but ineffectually, he remained to the last moment aiding the\r\nwounded and encouraging surgeons to remain on the field as many of\r\nthem did.\"[833] Wadsworth's subsequent insistence that the Army of the\r\nPotomac, then commanded by McClellan, could easily crush the\r\nConfederates, who, in his opinion, did not number over 50,000[834], had\r\nagain brought his name conspicuously before the country. Moreover,\r\nsince the 8th of March he had commanded the forces in and about\r\nWashington, and had acted as Stanton's adviser in the conduct of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 830: New York _Herald_, September 19 and October 15, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 831: Albany _Evening Journal_, November 6, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 832: T.W. Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 413.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 833: Albany _Evening Journal_, July 31, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 834: \"This estimate was afterward verified as correct.\"--New\r\nYork _Tribune_, September 22, 1862.]\r\n\r\nFor twenty years Wadsworth had not been a stranger to the people of\r\nNew York. His vigorous defence of Silas Wright gave him a warm place\r\nin the hearts of Barnburners, and his name, after the formation of the\r\nRepublican party, became a household word among members of that young\r\norganisation. Besides, his neighbours had exploited his character for\r\ngenerosity. The story of the tenant who got a receipt for rent and one\r\nhundred dollars in money because the accidental killing of his oxen in\r\nthe midst of harvest had diminished his earning capacity, seemed to be\r\nonly one of many similar acts. In 1847 his farm had furnished a\r\nthousand bushels of corn to starving Ireland. Moreover, he had endowed\r\ninstitutions of learning, founded school libraries, and turned the\r\nhouses of tenants into homes of college students. But the Radicals'\r\nreal reason for making him their candidate was his \"recognition of the\r\ntruth that slavery is the implacable enemy of our National life, and\r\nthat the Union can only be saved by grappling directly and boldly with\r\nits deadly foe.\"[835]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 835: New York _Tribune_, September 22, 1862.]\r\n\r\nPrompted by this motive his supporters used all the methods known to\r\nmanaging politicians to secure a majority of the delegates. Lincoln's\r\nemancipation proclamation, published on September 23, five days after\r\nthe battle of Antietam, greatly strengthened them. They hailed the\r\nevent as their victory. It gave substance, too, to the Wadsworth\r\nplatform that \"the Union must crush out slavery, or slavery will\r\ndestroy the Union.\" Reinforced by such an unexpected ally, it was well\r\nunderstood before the day of the convention that in spite of the\r\nappeals of Weed and Raymond, and of the wishes of Seward and the\r\nPresident, the choice of the Radicals would be nominated. Wadsworth\r\nwas not averse. He had an itching for public life. In 1856 his\r\nstubborn play for governor and his later contest for a seat in the\r\nUnited States Senate had characterised him as an office-seeker. But\r\nwhether running for office himself, or helping some one else, he was\r\na fighter whom an opponent had reason to fear.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Union convention, as it was called, assembled at\r\nSyracuse on September 25. Henry J. Raymond became its president, and\r\nwith characteristic directness made a vigorous reply to Seymour,\r\ndeclaring that \"Jefferson Davis himself could not have planned a\r\nspeech better calculated, under all the circumstances of the case, to\r\npromote his end to embarrass the Government of the United States and\r\nstrengthen the hands of those who are striving for its overthrow.\"[836]\r\nThen William Curtis Noyes read a letter from Governor Morgan declining\r\nrenomination.[837] The Governor had made a creditable executive,\r\nwinning the respect of conservatives in both parties, and although the\r\nrule against a third term had become firmly established in a State\r\nthat had tolerated it but once since the days of Tompkins and DeWitt\r\nClinton, the propriety of making a further exception appealed to the\r\npublic with manifest approval. \"But this,\" Weed said, \"did not suit\r\nthe _Tribune_ and a class of politicians with whom it sympathised.\r\nThey demanded a candidate with whom abolition is the paramount\r\nconsideration.\"[838] Morgan's letter created a ripple of applause,\r\nafter which the presentation of Wadsworth's name aroused an enthusiasm\r\nof longer duration than had existed at Albany. Nevertheless, Charles\r\nG. Myers of St. Lawrence did not hesitate to speak for \"a more\r\navailable candidate at the present time.\" Then, raising his voice\r\nabove the whisperings of dissent, he named John A. Dix, \"who, while\r\nSeymour was howling for peace and compromise,\" said the speaker,\r\n\"ordered the first man shot that hauled down the American flag.\"\r\nRaymond, in his speech earlier in the afternoon, had quoted the\r\nhistoric despatch in a well-balanced sentence, with the accent and\r\ninflection of a trained orator; but in giving it an idiomatic,\r\nthrilling ring in contrast with Seymour's record, Myers suddenly threw\r\nthe convention into wild, continued cheering, until it seemed as if\r\nthe noise of a moment before would be exceeded by the genuine and\r\ninvoluntary outburst of patriotic emotion. A single ballot, however,\r\ngiving Wadsworth an overwhelming majority, showed that the Radicals\r\nowned the convention.[839]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 836: New York _Times_, September 25, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 837: \"Though we met Governor Morgan repeatedly during the\r\nsummer, he never hinted that he expected or desired to be again a\r\ncandidate.\"--New York _Tribune_, December 12, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 838: Albany _Evening Journal_, December 10, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 839: The vote resulted as follows: Wadsworth, 234; Dix, 110;\r\nLyman Tremaine, 33; Dickinson, 2.\r\n\r\nThe ticket was as follows: Governor, James S. Wadsworth of Genesee;\r\nLieutenant-Governor, Lyman Tremaine of Albany; Canal Commissioner,\r\nOliver Ladue of Herkimer; Prison Inspector, Andreas Willman of New\r\nYork; Clerk of Appeals, Charles Hughes of Washington.]\r\n\r\nParke Godwin of Queens, from the committee on resolutions, presented\r\nthe platform. Among other issues it urged the most vigorous\r\nprosecution of the war; hailed, with the profoundest satisfaction, the\r\nemancipation proclamation; and expressed pride in the knowledge that\r\nthe Republic's only enemies \"are the savages of the West, the rebels\r\nof the South, their sympathisers and supporters of the North, and the\r\ndespots of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThe campaign opened with unexampled bitterness. Seymour's convention\r\nspeech inflamed the Republican party, and its press, recalling his\r\naddress at the Peace convention in January, 1861, seemed to uncork its\r\npent-up indignation. The _Tribune_ pronounced him a \"consummate\r\ndemagogue,\" \"radically dishonest,\" and the author of sentiments that\r\n\"will be read throughout the rebel States with unalloyed delight,\"\r\nsince \"their whole drift tends to encourage treason and paralyse the\r\narm of those who strike for the Union.\"[840] It disclosed Seymour's\r\nintimate relations with \"Vallandigham and the school of Democrats who\r\ndo not disguise their sympathy with traitors nor their hostility to\r\nwar,\" and predicted \"that, if elected, Jeff Davis will regard his\r\nsuccess as a triumph.\"[841] Odious comparisons also became frequent.\r\nWadsworth at Bull Run was contrasted with Seymour's prediction that\r\nthe Union's foes could not be subdued.[842] Seymour's supporters, it\r\nwas said, believed in recognising the independence of the South, or in\r\na restored Union with slavery conserved, while Wadsworth's champions\r\nthought rebellion a wicked and wanton conspiracy against human\r\nliberty, to be crushed by the most effective measures.[843] Raymond\r\ndeclared that \"every vote given for Wadsworth is a vote for loyalty,\r\nand every vote given for Seymour is a vote for treason.\"[844]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 840: New York _Tribune_, September 17, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 841: New York _Tribune_, Oct. 8, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 842: _Ibid._, Oct. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 843: _Ibid._, Oct. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 844: New York _Herald_, Oct. 9, 1862.]\r\n\r\nTo these thrusts the Democratic press replied with no less acrimony,\r\nspeaking of Wadsworth as \"a malignant, abolition disorganiser,\" whose\r\nservice in the field was \"very brief,\" whose command in Washington was\r\n\"behind fortifications,\" and whose capacity was \"limited to attacks\r\nupon his superior officers.\"[845] The _Herald_ declared him \"as arrant\r\nan aristocrat as any Southern rebel. The slave-holder,\" it said, \"lives\r\nupon his plantation, which his ancestors begged, cheated, or stole\r\nfrom the Indians. Wadsworth lives upon his immense Genesee farms,\r\nwhich his ancestors obtained from the Indians in precisely the same\r\nway. The slave-holder has a number of negroes who raise crops for him,\r\nand whom he clothes, feeds, and lodges. Wadsworth has a number of\r\nlabourers on his farms, who support him by raising his crops or paying\r\nhim rent. The slave-holder, having an independent fortune and nothing\r\nto do, joins the army, or runs for office. Wadsworth, in exactly the\r\nsame circumstances, does exactly the same thing. Wadsworth, therefore,\r\nis quite as much an aristocrat as the slave-holder, and cares quite as\r\nmuch for himself and quite as little for the people.\"[846] Democrats\r\neverywhere endeavoured to limit the issue to the two opposing\r\ncandidates, claiming that Seymour, in conjunction with all\r\nconservative men, stood for a vigorous prosecution of the war to save\r\nthe Union, while Wadsworth, desiring its prosecution for the\r\ndestruction of slavery, believed the Union of secondary consideration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 845: _Ibid._, Sept. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 846: _Ibid._, Oct. 1.]\r\n\r\nCampaign oratory, no longer softened by the absence of strict party\r\nlines, throbbed feverishly with passion and ugly epithet. The\r\nstrategical advantage lay with Seymour, who made two speeches. Dean\r\nRichmond, alarmed at the growing strength of the war spirit, urged him\r\nto put more \"powder\" into his Brooklyn address than he used at the\r\nratification meeting, held in New York City on October 13; but he\r\ndeclined to cater \"to war Democrats,\" contenting himself with an\r\namplification of his convention speech. \"God knows I love my country,\"\r\nhe said; \"I would count my life as nothing, if I could but save the\r\nnation's life.\" He resented with much feeling Raymond's electioneering\r\nstatement that a vote for him was one for treason.[847] \"Recognising at\r\nthis moment as we do,\" he continued, \"that the destinies, the honour,\r\nand the glory of our country hang poised upon the conflict in the\r\nbattlefield, we tender to the Government no conditional support\" to\r\nput down \"this wicked and mighty rebellion.\" Once, briefly, and\r\nwithout bitterness, he referred to the emancipation proclamation, but\r\nhe again bitterly arraigned the Administration for its infractions of\r\nthe Constitution, its deception as to the strength of the South, and\r\nthe corruption in its departments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 847: New York _Herald_, October 8 and 9, 1862.]\r\n\r\nSeymour's admirers manifested his tendencies more emphatically than he\r\ndid himself, until denunciation of treason and insistence upon a\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war yielded to an indictment of the\r\nRadicals. The shibboleth of these declaimers was arbitrary arrests.\r\nTwo days after the edict of emancipation (September 24) the President\r\nissued a proclamation ordering the arrest, without benefit of _habeas\r\ncorpus_, of all who \"discouraged enlistments,\" or were guilty of \"any\r\ndisloyal practice\" which afforded \"aid and comfort to the rebels.\"[848]\r\nThis gave rise to an opinion that he intended to \"suppress free\r\ndiscussion of political subjects,\"[849] and every orator warned the\r\npeople that Wadsworth's election meant the arrest and imprisonment of\r\nhis political opponents. \"If chosen governor,\" said the _Herald_, \"he\r\nwill have his adversaries consigned to dungeons and their property\r\nseized and confiscated under the act of Congress.\"[850] In accepting an\r\ninvitation to speak at Rome, John Van Buren, quick to see the humour\r\nof the situation as well as the vulnerable point of the Radicals,\r\ntelegraphed that he would \"arrive at two o'clock--if not in Fort\r\nLafayette.\"[851]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 848: _Lincoln's Works_, Vol. 2, p. 239.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 849: Benjamin E. Curtis, _Pamphlet on Executive Power_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 850: New York _Herald_, October 4, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 851: _Ibid._, October 24.]\r\n\r\nTo the delight of audiences John Van Buren, after two years of\r\npolitical inactivity, broke his silence. He had earnestly and perhaps\r\nsincerely advocated the nomination of John A. Dix, but after Seymour's\r\nselection he again joined the ranks of the Softs and took the stump.\r\nAmong other appointments he spoke with Seymour at the New York\r\nratification meeting, and again at the Brooklyn rally on October 22.\r\nSomething remained of the old-time vigour of the professional\r\ngladiator, but compared with his Barnburner work he seemed what Byron\r\ncalled \"an extinct volcano.\" He ran too heedlessly into a bitter\r\ncriticism of Wadsworth, based upon an alleged conversation he could\r\nnot substantiate, and into an acrimonious attack upon Lincoln's\r\nconduct of the war, predicated upon a private letter of General Scott,\r\nthe possession of which he did not satisfactorily account for. The\r\n_Tribune_, referring to his campaign as \"a rhetorical spree,\" called\r\nhim a \"buffoon,\" a \"political harlequin,\" a \"repeater of mouldy\r\njokes,\"[852] and in bitter terms denounced his \"low comedy performance\r\nat Tammany,\" his \"double-shuffle dancing at Mozart Hall,\" his\r\npossession of a letter \"by dishonourable means for a dishonourable\r\npurpose,\" and his wide-sweeping statements \"which gentlemen over their\r\nown signatures pronounced lies.\"[853] It was not a performance to be\r\nproud of, and although Van Buren succeeded in stirring up the\r\nadvertising sensations which he craved, he did not escape without\r\nwounds that left deep scars. \"Prince John makes a statement,\" says the\r\n_Herald_, \"accusing Charles King of slandering the wife of Andrew\r\nJackson; King retorts by calling the Prince a liar; the poets of the\r\n_Post_ take up the case and broadly hint that the Prince's private\r\nhistory shows that he has not lived the life of a saint; the Prince\r\nreplies that he has half a mind to walk into the private antecedents\r\nof Wadsworth, which, it is said, would disclose some scenes\r\nexceedingly rich; while certain other Democrats, indignant at\r\nRaymond's accusations of treason against Seymour, threaten to reveal\r\nhis individual history, hinting, by the way, that it would show him to\r\nhave been heretofore a follower of that fussy philosopher of the\r\ntwelfth century, Abelard--not in philosophy, however, but in\r\nsentiment, romance, and some other things.\"[854]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 852: New York _Tribune_, October 28, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 853: _Ibid._, October 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 854: New York _Herald_, October 29, 1862.]\r\n\r\nWherever Van Buren spoke Daniel S. Dickinson followed. His admirers,\r\nthe most extreme Radicals, cheered his speeches wildly, their fun\r\nrelieving the prosaic rigour of an issue that to one side seemed\r\nforced by Northern treachery, to the other to threaten the gravest\r\nperil to the country. It is difficult to exaggerate the tension. Party\r\nviolence ran high and the result seemed in doubt. Finally,\r\nconservatives appealed to both candidates to retire in favour of John\r\nA. Dix,[855] and on October 20 an organisation, styling itself the\r\nFederal Union, notified the General that its central committee had\r\nnominated him for governor, and that a State Convention, called to\r\nmeet at Cooper Institute on the 28th, would ratify the nomination. To\r\nthis summons, Dix, without declining a nomination, replied from\r\nMaryland that he could not leave his duties \"to be drawn into any\r\nparty strife.\"[856] This settled the question of a compromise\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 855: _Ibid._, October 15 and 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 856: Morgan Dix, _Memoirs of John A. Dix_, Vol. 2, pp.\r\n51-52.]\r\n\r\nElections in the October States did not encourage the Radicals.\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana voiced the sentiments of the\r\nopposition, defeating Galusha A. Grow, speaker of the House, and\r\nseriously threatening the Radical majority in Congress. This\r\nretrogression, accounted for by the absence of soldiers who could not\r\nvote,[857] suggested trouble in New York, and to offset the influence\r\nof the Seymour rally in Brooklyn a great audience at Cooper Institute\r\nlistened to a brief letter from the Secretary of State, and to a\r\nspeech from Wadsworth. Seward did not encourage the soldier candidate.\r\nThe rankling recollection of Wadsworth's opposition at Chicago in 1860\r\nstifled party pride as well as patriotism, and although the _Herald_\r\nthought it \"brilliant and sarcastic,\" it emphasised Wadsworth's\r\nsubsequent statement that \"Seward was dead against me throughout the\r\ncampaign.\"[858]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 857: New York _Tribune_, October 17, 1862. See other views:\r\nNew York _Herald_, October 17, 18, 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 858: Henry B. Stanton, _Random Recollections_, p. 216.]\r\n\r\nWadsworth's canvass was confined to a single speech. He had been\r\nabsent from the State fifteen months, and although not continuously at\r\nthe front there was something inexcusably ungenerous in the taunts of\r\nhis opponents that he had served \"behind fortifications.\" His superb\r\nconduct at Bull Run entitled him to better treatment. But his party\r\nwas wholly devoted to him, and \"amid a hurricane of approbation\"[859]\r\nhe mingled censure of Seymour with praise of Lincoln, and the\r\nexperience of a brave soldier with bitter criticism of an unpatriotic\r\npress. It was not the work of a trained public speaker. It lacked\r\npoise, phrase, and deliberation. But what it wanted in manner it made\r\nup in fire and directness, giving an emotional and loyal audience\r\nabundant opportunity to explode into long-continued cheering.\r\nThoughtful men who were not in any sense political partisans gave\r\ncareful heed to his words. He stood for achievement. He brought the\r\ngreat struggle nearer home, and men listened as to one with a message\r\nfrom the field of patriotic sacrifices. The radical newspapers broke\r\ninto a chorus of applause. The Radicals themselves were delighted. The\r\nair rung with praises of the courage and spirit of their candidate,\r\nand if here and there the faint voice of a Conservative suggested that\r\nemancipation was premature and arbitrary arrests were unnecessary, a\r\nshout of offended patriotism drowned the ignoble utterance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 859: New York _Tribune_, October 31, 1862.]\r\n\r\nWadsworth and his party were too much absorbed in the zeal of their\r\ncause not to run counter to the prejudices of men less earnest and\r\nless self-forgetting. In a contest of such bitterness they were\r\ncertain to make enemies, whose hostilities would be subtle and\r\nenduring, and the October elections showed that the inevitable\r\nreaction was setting in. Military failure and increasing debt made the\r\navowed policy of emancipation more offensive. People were getting\r\ntired of bold action without achievement in the field, and every\r\nopponent of the Administration became a threnodist. However,\r\nindependent papers which strongly favoured Seymour believed in\r\nWadsworth's success. \"Seymour's antecedents are against him,\" said the\r\n_Herald_. \"Wadsworth, radical as he is, will be preferred by the\r\npeople to a Democrat who is believed to be in favour of stopping the\r\nwar; because, whatever Wadsworth's ideas about the negro may be, they\r\nare only as dust in the balance compared with his hearty and earnest\r\nsupport of the war and the Administration.\"[860] This was the belief\r\nof the Radicals,[861] and upon them the news of Seymour's election by\r\nover 10,000 majority fell with a sickening thud.[862] Raymond declared\r\nit \"a vote of want of confidence in the President;\"[863] Wadsworth\r\nthought Seward did it;[864] Weed suggested that Wadsworth held \"too\r\nextreme party views;\"[865] and Greeley insisted that it was \"a gang of\r\ncorrupt Republican politicians, who, failing to rule the nominating\r\nconvention, took revenge on its patriotic candidate by secretly\r\nsupporting the Democratic nominee.\"[866] But the dominant reason was\r\nwhat George William Curtis called \"the mad desperation of\r\nreaction,\"[867] which showed its influence in other States as well as\r\nin New York. That Wadsworth's personality had little, if anything, to\r\ndo with his overthrow was further evidenced by results in\r\ncongressional districts, the Democrats carrying seventeen out of\r\nthirty-one. Even Francis Kernan carried the Oneida district against\r\nConkling. The latter was undoubtedly embarrassed by personal enemies\r\nwho controlled the Welsh vote, but the real cause of his defeat was\r\nmilitary disasters, financial embarrassments, and the emancipation\r\nproclamation. \"All our reverses, our despondence, our despairs,\" said\r\nCurtis, \"bring us to the inevitable issue, shall not the blacks strike\r\nfor their freedom?\"[868]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 860: New York _Herald_, October 17, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 861: New York _Tribune_, Nov. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 862: \"Seymour, 307,063; Wadsworth, 296,492.\"--_Ibid._,\r\nNovember 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 863: New York _Times_, November 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 864: Henry B.

In the Senate, elected in 1861, the Republicans had\r\ntwelve majority, but in the Assembly each party controlled sixty-four\r\nmembers. This deadlocked the election of a speaker, and seriously\r\njeopardized the selection of a United States senator in place of\r\nPreston King, since a joint-convention of the two houses, under the\r\nlaw as it then existed, could not convene until some candidate\r\ncontrolled a majority in each branch.[869] It increased the\r\nembarrassment that either a Republican or Democrat must betray his\r\nparty to break the deadlock.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 869: Laws of 1842. Ch. 130, title 6, article 4, sec. 32.]\r\n\r\nChauncey M. Depew was the choice of the Republicans for speaker. But\r\nthe caucus, upon the threat of a single Republican to bolt,[870]\r\nselected Henry Sherwood of Steuben. After seventy-seven ballots Depew\r\nwas substituted for Sherwood. By this time Timothy C. Callicot, a\r\nBrooklyn Democrat, refused longer to vote for Gilbert Dean, the\r\nDemocratic nominee. Deeply angered by such apostasy John D. Van Buren\r\nand Saxton Smith, the Democratic leaders, offered Depew eight votes.\r\nLater in the evening Depew was visited by Callicot, who promised, if\r\nthe Republicans would support him for speaker, to vote for John A. Dix\r\nfor senator and thus break the senatorial deadlock. It was a trying\r\nposition for Depew. The speakership was regarded as even a greater\r\nhonor then than it is now, and to a gifted young man of twenty-nine\r\nits power and prestige appealed with tremendous force. Van Buren's\r\nproposition would elect him; Callicot's would put him in eclipse.\r\nNevertheless, Depew unselfishly submitted the two proposals to his\r\nRepublican associates, who decided to lose the speakership and elect a\r\nUnited States senator.[871]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 870: Horace Bemis of Steuben.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 871: The writer is indebted to Mr. Depew for the interviews\r\nbetween himself, Van Buren, and Callicot.]\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, alarmed at this sudden and successful flank movement,\r\ndetermined to defeat by disorderly proceedings what their leaders\r\ncould not prevent by strategy, and with the help of thugs who filled\r\nthe floor and galleries of the Assembly Chamber, they instigated a\r\nriot scarcely equalled in the legislative history of modern times.\r\nBoisterous threats, display of pistols, savage abuse of Callicot, and\r\nrefusals to allow the balloting to proceed continued for six days,\r\nsubsiding at last after the Governor, called upon to protect a\r\nlaw-making body, promised to use force. Finally, on January 26,\r\nnineteen days after the session opened, Callicot, on the ninety-third\r\nballot, received two majority. This opened the way for the election of\r\na Republican United States senator.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley had hoped, in the event of Wadsworth's success, to ride\r\ninto the Senate upon \"an abolition whirlwind.\"[872] He now wished to\r\nelect Preston King or Daniel S. Dickinson. King had made a creditable\r\nrecord in the Senate. Although taking little part in debate, his\r\njudgment upon questions of governmental policy, indicating an accurate\r\nknowledge of men and remarkable familiarity with details, commended\r\nhim as a safe adviser, especially in political emergencies. But Weed,\r\nabandoning his old St. Lawrence friend, joined Seward in the support\r\nof Edwin D. Morgan.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 872: Albany _Evening Journal_, December 10, 1862.]\r\n\r\nMorgan had a decided taste for political life. When a grocer, living\r\nin Connecticut, he had served in the city council of Hartford, and\r\nsoon after gaining a residence in New York, he entered its Board of\r\nAldermen. Then he became State senator, commissioner of immigration,\r\nchairman of the National Republican Committee, and finally governor.\r\nBesides wielding an influence acquired in two gubernatorial terms, he\r\ncombined the qualities of a shrewd politician with those of a merchant\r\nprince willing to spend money.\r\n\r\nThe stoutest opposition to Morgan came from extreme Radicals who\r\ndistrusted him, and in trying to compass his defeat half a dozen\r\ncandidates played prominent parts. Charles B. Sedgwick of Syracuse, an\r\nall-around lawyer of rare ability, whose prominence as a persuasive\r\nspeaker began in the Free-Soil campaign of 1848, and who had served\r\nwith distinction for four years in Congress, proved acceptable to a\r\nfew Radicals and several Conservatives.[873] Henry J. Raymond, also\r\npressed by the opponents of Morgan, attracted a substantial following,\r\nwhile David Dudley Field, Ward Hunt, and Henry R. Selden controlled\r\ntwo or three votes each. Nevertheless, a successful combination could\r\nnot be established, and on the second formal ballot Morgan received a\r\nlarge majority. The remark of Assemblyman Truman, on a motion to make\r\nthe nomination unanimous, evidenced the bitterness of the contest. \"I\r\nbelieve we are rewarding a man,\" he said, \"who placed the knife at the\r\nthroat of the Union ticket last fall and slaughtered it.\"[874]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 873: Sedgwick, assailed by damaging charges growing out of\r\nhis chairmanship of the Naval Committee, failed to be renominated for\r\nCongress in 1864 after a most bitter contest in which 130 ballots were\r\ntaken.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 874: New York _Journal of Commerce_, February 3, 1863.\r\n\r\n\"Informal ballot: Morgan, 25; King, 16; Dickinson, 15; Sedgwick, 11;\r\nField, 7; Raymond, 6; Hunt, 4; Selden, 1; blank, 1. Whole number, 86.\r\nNecessary to a choice, 44.\r\n\r\n\"First formal ballot: Morgan, 39; King, 16; Dickinson, 11; Raymond, 8;\r\nSedgwick, 7; Field, 5.\r\n\r\n\"Second formal ballot: Morgan, 50; Dickinson, 13; King, 11; Raymond,\r\n9; Field, 2; Sedgwick, 1.\"--_Ibid._, February 3.]\r\n\r\nThe Democrats presented Erastus Corning of Albany, then a member of\r\nCongress. Like Morgan, Corning was wealthy. Like Morgan, too, he had a\r\npredilection for politics, having served as alderman, state senator,\r\nmayor, and congressman. He belonged to a class of business men whose\r\nexperience and ability, when turned to public affairs, prove of\r\ndecided value to their State and country. \"We should be glad,\" said\r\nthe _Tribune_, \"to see more men of Mr. Corning's social and business\r\nposition brought forward for Congress and the Legislature.\"[875] The\r\nfirst ballot, in joint convention, gave Morgan 86 to 70 for Corning,\r\nSpeaker Callicot voting for John A. Dix, and one fiery Radical for\r\nDaniel S. Dickinson. Thus did Thurlow Weed score another victory.\r\nGreeley was willing to make any combination. Raymond, Sedgwick, Ward\r\nHunt, and even David Dudley Field would quickly have appealed to him.\r\nThe deft hand of Weed, however, if not the money of Morgan, prevented\r\ncombinations until the Governor, as a second choice, controlled the\r\nelection.[876] This success resulted in a combination of Democrats and\r\nconservative Republicans, giving Weed the vast patronage of the New\r\nYork canals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 875: New York _Tribune_, October 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic caucus stood 28 for Erastus Corning, 25 for Fernando\r\nWood, and scattering 18.\r\n\r\nThe vote of the Senate stood: Morgan, 23; Erastus Corning, 7; 2 absent\r\nor silent. On the first ballot the Assembly gave Morgan 64, Corning\r\n62, Fernando Wood 1, John A. Dix 1 (cast by Speaker Callicot). On a\r\nsecond ballot all the Unionists voted with Callicot for Dix, giving\r\nhim 65 to 63 for Corning and placing him in nomination. In joint\r\nconvention Morgan was elected by 86 votes to 70 for Corning, one\r\n(Callicot's) for Dix, and 1 for Dickinson.--_Ibid._, February 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 876: \"My dear Weed: It is difficult for me to express my\r\npersonal obligations to you for this renewed evidence of your\r\nfriendship, as manifested by the result of yesterday's proceedings at\r\nAlbany.\"--Letter of Edwin D. Morgan, February 3, 1863. Thurlow Weed\r\nBarnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 430.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was only coincidental that Weed's withdrawal from the\r\n_Evening Journal_ concurred with Morgan's election, but his farewell\r\neditorial, written while gloom and despondency filled the land,\r\nindicated that he unerringly read the signs of the times. \"I differ\r\nwidely with my party about the best means of crushing the rebellion,\"\r\nhe said. \"I can neither impress others with my views nor surrender my\r\nown solemn convictions. The alternative of living in strife with those\r\nwhom I have esteemed, or withdrawing, is presented. I have not\r\nhesitated in choosing the path of peace as the path of duty. If those\r\nwho differ with me are right, and the country is carried safely\r\nthrough its present struggle, all will be well and 'nobody\r\nhurt.'\"[877] This did not mean that Weed \"has ceased to be a\r\nRepublican,\" as Greeley put it,[878] but that, while refusing to\r\nbecome an Abolitionist of the Chase and Sumner and Greeley type, he\r\ndeclined longer to urge his conservative views upon readers who\r\npossessed the spirit of Radicals. Years afterward he wrote that \"from\r\nthe outbreak of the rebellion, I knew no party, nor did I care for any\r\nexcept the party of the Union.\"[879]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 877: Albany _Evening Journal_, January 28, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 878: New York _Tribune_, January 30, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 879: Thurlow Weed Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n485.]\r\n\r\nAt the time of his retirement from the _Journal_, Weed was sixty-six\r\nyears of age, able-bodied, rich, independent, and satisfied if not\r\nsurfeited. \"So far as all things personal are concerned,\" he said, \"my\r\nwork is done.\"[880] Yet a trace of unhappiness revealed itself.\r\nPerfect peace did not come with the possession of wealth.[881]\r\nMoreover, his political course had grieved and separated friends. For\r\nthirty years he looked forward with pleasurable emotions to the time\r\nwhen, released from the cares of journalism, he might return to\r\nRochester, spending his remaining days on a farm, in the suburbs of\r\nthat city, near the banks of the Genesee River; but in 1863 he found\r\nhis old friends so hostile, charging him with the defeat of Wadsworth,\r\nthat he abandoned the project and sought a home in New York.[882]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 880: Albany _Evening Journal_, January 28, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 881: \"Let it pass whether or not the editor of the _Tribune_\r\nhas been intensely ambitious for office. It would have been a blessed\r\nthing for the country if the editor of the _Journal_ had been impelled\r\nby the same passion. For avarice is more ignoble than ambition, and\r\nthe craving for jobs has a more corrupting influence, alike on the\r\nindividual and the public, than aspiration to office.\"--New York\r\n_Tribune_, December 12, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 882: Thurlow Weed, _Autobiography_, pp. 360-361.]\r\n\r\nFor several years Weed had made his political headquarters in that\r\ncity. Indeed, No. 12 Astor House was as famous in its day as 49\r\nBroadway became during the subsequent leadership of Thomas C. Platt.\r\nIt was the cradle of the \"Amens\" forty years before the Fifth Avenue\r\nHotel became the abode of that remarkable organization. From 1861 to\r\n1865, owing to the enormous political patronage growing out of the\r\nwar, the lobbies of the Astor House were crowded with politicians from\r\nall parts of New York, making ingress and egress almost impossible. In\r\nthe midst of this throng sat Thurlow Weed, cool and patient,\r\npossessing the keen judgment of men so essential to leadership. \"When\r\nI was organizing the Internal Revenue Office in 1862-3,\" wrote George\r\nS. Boutwell, \"Mr. Weed gave me information in regard to candidates for\r\noffice in the State of New York, including their relations to the\r\nfactions that existed, with as much fairness as he could have\r\ncommanded if he had had no relation to either one.\"[883]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 883: George S. Boutwell, _Sixty Years in Public Affairs_,\r\nVol. 2, p. 207.]\r\n\r\nAlthough opposed to the course of the Radicals, Weed sternly rebuked\r\nthose, now called Copperheads,[884] who endeavored to force peace by\r\nparalysing the arm of the government. Their denunciation of arrests\r\nand of the suspension of _habeas corpus_ gradually included the\r\ndiscouragement of enlistments, the encouragement of desertion, and\r\nresistance to the draft, until, at last, the spirit of opposition\r\ninvaded halls of legislation as well as public meetings and the press.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 884: This opprobrious epithet first appeared in the New York\r\n_Tribune_ of January 12, 1863, and in the _Times_ of February 13.]\r\n\r\nTo check this display of disloyalty the Union people, regardless of\r\nparty, formed loyal or Union League clubs in the larger cities, whose\r\ndensely packed meetings commanded the ablest speakers of the country.\r\nJohn Van Buren, fully aroused to the seditious trend of peace\r\nadvocates, evidenced again the power that made him famous in 1848. In\r\nhis inimitable style, with admirable temper and freshness, he poured\r\nhis scathing sarcasm upon the authors of disloyal sentiments, until\r\nlisteners shouted with delight. The _Tribune_, forgetful of his\r\nflippant work in the preceding year, accorded him the highest praise,\r\nwhile strong men, with faces wet with tears, thanked God that this\r\nAchilles of the Democrats spoke for the Republic with the trumpet\r\ntones and torrent-like fluency that had formerly made the name of\r\nBarnburner a terror to the South. Van Buren was not inconsistent.\r\nWhile favouring a vigorous prosecution of the war he had severely\r\ncriticised arbitrary arrests and other undemocratic methods, but when\r\n\"little men of little souls,\" as he called them, attempted to control\r\nthe great party for illegal purposes, his patriotism flashed out in\r\nthe darkness like a revolving light on a rocky coast.\r\n\r\nThe call of the Loyal League also brought James T. Brady from his law\r\noffice. Unlike Dickinson, Brady did not approve the teachings or the\r\nmethods of the Radicals, neither had he like Van Buren supported\r\nSeymour. Moreover, he had refused to take office from Tammany, or to\r\naccept nomination from a Democratic State convention. However, when\r\nthe enemies of the Government seemed likely to carry all before them,\r\nhe spoke for the Union like one divinely inspired. Indeed, it may be\r\nsaid with truth that the only ray of hope piercing the gloom and\r\nsuspense in the early months of 1863 came from the brilliant outbursts\r\nof patriotism heard at the meetings of the Union League clubs.[885] \"I\r\npray that my name may be enrolled in that league,\" wrote Seward. \"I\r\nwould prefer that distinction to any honour my fellow-citizens could\r\nbestow upon me. If the country lives, as I trust it will, let me be\r\nremembered among those who laboured to save it. The diploma will grow\r\nin value as years roll away.\"[886]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 885: The Union League Club of New York was organized\r\nFebruary 6, 1863; its club house, No. 26 E. 17th St., was opened May\r\n12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 886: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 3, p. 159.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR SEYMOUR AND PRESIDENT LINCOLN\r\n\r\n1863\r\n\r\n\r\nHoratio Seymour did not become a member of the Union League, and his\r\ninaugural message of January 7 gave no indication of a change of\r\nheart. He spoke of his predecessor as having \"shown high capacity\" in\r\nthe performance of his duties; he insisted that \"we must emulate the\r\nconduct of our fathers, and show obedience to constituted authorities,\r\nand respect for legal and constitutional obligations;\" he demanded\r\neconomy and integrity; and he affirmed that \"under no circumstances\r\ncan the division of the Union be conceded. We will put forth every\r\nexertion of power; we will use every policy of conciliation; we will\r\nhold out every inducement to the people of the South, consistent with\r\nhonour, to return to their allegiance; we will guarantee them every\r\nright, every consideration demanded by the Constitution, and by that\r\nfraternal regard which must prevail in a common country; but we can\r\nnever voluntarily consent to the breaking up of the Union of these\r\nStates, or the destruction of the Constitution.\" With his usual\r\nseverity he opposed arbitrary arrests, deemed martial law destructive\r\nof the rights of States, and declared that the abolition of slavery\r\nfor the purpose of restoring the Union would convert the government\r\ninto a military despotism.\r\n\r\n\"It has been assumed,\" he said, \"that this war will end in the\r\nascendency of the views of one or the other of the extremes in our\r\ncountry. Neither will prevail. This is the significance of the late\r\nelections. The determination of the great Central and Western States\r\nis to defend the rights of the States, the rights of individuals, and\r\nto restore our Union as it was. We must not wear out the lives of our\r\nsoldiers by a war to carry out vague theories. The policy of\r\nsubjugation and extermination means not only the destruction of the\r\nlives and property of the South, but also the waste of the blood and\r\ntreasure of the North. There is but one way to save us from\r\ndemoralisation, discord, and repudiation. No section must be\r\ndisorganised. All must be made to feel that the mighty efforts we are\r\nmaking to save our Union are stimulated by a purpose to restore peace\r\nand prosperity in every section. If it is true that slavery must be\r\nabolished by force; that the South must be held in military\r\nsubjection; that four millions of negroes must be under the management\r\nof authorities at Washington at the public expense; then, indeed, we\r\nmust endure the waste of our armies, further drains upon our\r\npopulation, and still greater burdens of debt. We must convert our\r\ngovernment into a military despotism. The mischievous opinion that in\r\nthis contest the North must subjugate and destroy the South to save\r\nour Union has weakened the hopes of our citizens at home, and\r\ndestroyed confidence in our success abroad.\"[887]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 887: Horatio Seymour, _Public Record_, pp. 85-105.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this message failed to recognise the difference between a\r\npeaceable South in the Union and a rebellious South attempting to\r\ndestroy the Union, it is not easy, perhaps, to comprehend how the\r\nacknowledged leader of the opposition, holding such views and relying\r\nfor support upon the peace sentiment of the country, could have said\r\nmuch less. Yet the feeling must possess the student of history that a\r\nconsummate politician, possessing Seymour's ability and popularity,\r\nmight easily have divided with Lincoln the honor of crushing the\r\nrebellion and thus have become his successor. The President recognized\r\nthis opportunity, saying to Weed that the \"Governor has greater power\r\njust now for good than any other man in the country. He can wheel the\r\nDemocratic party into line, put down rebellion, and preserve the\r\ngovernment. Tell him for me that if he will render this service for\r\nhis country, I shall cheerfully make way for him as my successor.\"[888]\r\nSeymour's reply, if he made one, is not of record, but Lincoln's\r\nmessage would scarcely appeal to one who disbelieved in the North's\r\nability to subjugate the South. Later in the spring the President,\r\nunwilling to give the Governor up, wrote him a characteristic note.\r\n\"You and I,\" said he, \"are, substantially, strangers, and I write this\r\nchiefly that we may become better acquainted. As to maintaining the\r\nnation's life and integrity, I assume and believe there cannot be a\r\ndifference of purpose between you and me. If we should differ as to\r\nthe means it is important that such difference should be as small as\r\npossible; that it should not be enhanced by unjust suspicions on one\r\nside or the other. In the performance of my duty the coöperation of\r\nyour State, as that of others, is needed,--in fact, is indispensable.\r\nThis alone is a sufficient reason why I should wish to be at a good\r\nunderstanding with you. Please write me at least as long a letter as\r\nthis, of course saying in it just what you think fit.\"[889]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 888: T.W. Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 428.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 889: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 7, pp. 10, 11.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to fathom the impression made upon Seymour by this\r\nletter. The more cultivated Democrats about him entertained the belief\r\nthat Lincoln, somewhat uncouth and grotesque, was a weak though\r\nwell-meaning man, and the Governor doubtless held a similar opinion.\r\nMoreover, he believed that the President, alarmed by the existence of\r\na conspiracy of prominent Republicans to force him from the White\r\nHouse, sought to establish friendly relations that he might have an\r\nanchor to windward.[890] One can imagine the Governor, as the letter\r\nlingered in his hand, smiling superciliously and wondering what manner\r\nof man this Illinoisan is, who could say to a stranger what a little\r\nboy frequently puts in his missive, \"Please write me at least as long\r\na letter as this.\" At all events, he treated the President very\r\ncavalierly.[891] On April 14, after delaying three weeks, he wrote a\r\ncold and guarded reply, promising to address him again after the\r\nLegislature adjourned. \"In the meanwhile,\" he concluded, \"I assure you\r\nthat no political resentments, or no personal objects, will turn me\r\naside from the pathway I have marked out for myself. I intend to show\r\nto those charged with the administration of public affairs a due\r\ndeference and respect, and to yield to them a just and generous\r\nsupport in all measures they may adopt within the scope of their\r\nconstitutional powers. For the preservation of this Union I am ready\r\nto make any sacrifice of interest, passion, or prejudice.\"[892]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 890: New York _Times_, August 18, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 891: \"Governor Seymour was a patriotic man, after his\r\nfashion, but his hatred of the Lincoln Administration was evidently\r\ndeep; and it was also clear that he did not believe that the war for\r\nthe Union could be brought to a successful termination.\"--Andrew D.\r\nWhite, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 892: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 7, p. 11.]\r\n\r\nSeymour never wrote the promised letter. His inaugural expressed his\r\nhonest convictions. He wanted no relations with a President who seemed\r\nto prefer the abolition of slavery and the use of arbitrary methods. A\r\nfew days later, in vetoing a measure authorising soldiers to vote\r\nwhile absent in the army, he again showed his personal antipathy,\r\ncharging the President with rewarding officers of high rank for\r\nimproperly interfering in State elections, while subordinate officers\r\nwere degraded \"for the fair exercise of their political rights at\r\ntheir own homes.\"[893] John Hay did not err in saying \"there could be\r\nno intimate understanding between two such men.\"[894]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 893: Horatio Seymour, _Public Record_, p. 109.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 894: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 7, p. 12.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Burnside's arrest of Clement L. Vallandigham of Ohio (May,\r\n1863) increased Seymour's aversion to the President. Burnside's act\r\nlacked authority of law as well as the excuse of good judgment, and\r\nalthough the President's change of sentence from imprisonment in Fort\r\nWarren to banishment to the Southern Confederacy gave the proceeding a\r\nhumorous turn, the ugly fact remained that a citizen, in the dead of\r\nnight, with haste, and upon the evidence of disguised and partisan\r\ninformers, had been rudely deprived of liberty without due process of\r\nlaw. Thoughtful men who reverenced the safeguard known to civil\r\njudicial proceedings were appalled. The Republican press of New York\r\nthought it indefensible, while the opposition, with unprecedented\r\nbitterness, again assailed the Administration. In a moment the whole\r\nNorth was in a turmoil. Everywhere mass meetings, intemperate\r\nspeeches, and threats of violence inflamed the people. The basest\r\nelements in New York City, controlling a public meeting called to\r\ncondemn the \"outrage,\" indicated how easily a reign of riot and\r\nbloodshed might be provoked. To an assembly held in Albany on May 16,\r\nat which Erastus Corning presided, Seymour addressed a letter\r\ndeploring the unfortunate event as a dishonour brought upon the\r\ncountry by an utter disregard of the principles of civil liberty. \"It\r\nis a fearful thing,\" he said, \"to increase the danger which now\r\noverhangs us, by treating the law, the judiciary, and the authorities\r\nof States with contempt. If this proceeding is approved by the\r\ngovernment and sanctioned by the people, it is not merely a step\r\ntoward revolution, it is revolution; it will not only lead to military\r\ndespotism, it establishes military despotism. In this respect it must\r\nbe accepted, or in this respect it must be rejected. If it is upheld\r\nour liberties are overthrown.\" Then he grew bolder. \"The people of\r\nthis country now wait with the deepest anxiety the decision of the\r\nAdministration upon these acts. Having given it a generous support in\r\nthe conduct of the war, we now pause to see what kind of government it\r\nis for which we are asked to pour out our blood and our treasure. The\r\naction of the Administration will determine, in the minds of more than\r\none-half the people of the loyal States, whether this war is waged to\r\nput down rebellion in the South or to destroy free institutions at the\r\nNorth.\"[895]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 895: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1863, p. 689.]\r\n\r\nAt great length Lincoln replied to the resolutions forwarded by\r\nCorning. \"In my own discretion,\" wrote the President, \"I do not know\r\nwhether I would have ordered the arrest of Mr. Vallandigham.... I was\r\nslow to adopt the strong measures which by degrees I have been forced\r\nto regard as being within the exceptions of the Constitution and as\r\nindispensable to the public safety.... I think the time not unlikely\r\nto come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather\r\nthan too many.... Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who\r\ndeserts, while I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces\r\nhim to desert? This is none the less injurious when effected by\r\ngetting a father, a brother, or friend into a public meeting and then\r\nworking upon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier\r\nboy that he is fighting in a bad cause for a wicked administration and\r\ncontemptible government, too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall\r\ndesert.\"[896] This argument, undoubtedly the strongest that could be\r\nmade in justification, found great favour with his party, but the\r\ndanger Seymour apprehended lay in the precedent. \"Wicked men ambitious\r\nof power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of law,\" said Justice\r\nDavis of the United States Supreme Court, in deciding a case of\r\nsimilar character, \"may fill the place once occupied by Washington and\r\nLincoln, and if this right [of military arrest] is conceded, and the\r\ncalamities of war again befall us, the dangers to human liberty are\r\nfrightful to contemplate.\"[897]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 896: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1863, pp. 800-802. Lincoln,\r\n_Complete Works_, Vol. 2, p. 347.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 897: 4 Wallace, p. 125.]\r\n\r\nMuch as Seymour resented the arrest of Vallandigham, he did not allow\r\nthe incident to interfere with his official action, and to the\r\nSecretary of War's call for aid when General Lee began his midsummer\r\ninvasion of Pennsylvania, he responded promptly: \"I will spare no\r\neffort to send you troops at once,\" and true to his message he\r\nforwarded nineteen regiments, armed and equipped for field service,\r\nwhose arrival brought confidence.[898] But governed by the sinister\r\nreason that influenced him earlier in the year, he refused to\r\nacknowledge the President's letter of thanks, preferring to express\r\nhis opinion of Administration methods unhindered by the exchange of\r\ncourtesies. This he did in a Fourth of July address, delivered at the\r\nAcademy of Music in New York City, in which he pleaded, not\r\npassionately, not with the acrimony that ordinarily characterised his\r\nspeeches, but humbly, as if asking a despotic conqueror to return the\r\nrights and liberty of which the people had been robbed. \"We only ask\r\nfreedom of speech,--the right to exercise all the franchises conferred\r\nby the Constitution upon an American. Can you safely deny us these\r\nthings?\" Mingled also with pathetic appeals were joyless pictures of\r\nthe ravages of war, and cheerless glimpses into the future of a\r\nRepublic with its bulwarks of liberty torn away. \"We stand to-day,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"amid new made graves; we stand to-day in a land filled\r\nwith mourning, and our soil is saturated with the blood of the\r\nfiercest conflict of which history gives us an account. We can, if we\r\nwill, avert all these disasters and evoke a blessing. If we will do\r\nwhat? Hold that Constitution, and liberties, and laws are suspended?\r\nWill that restore them? Or shall we do as our fathers did under\r\ncircumstances of like trial, when they battled against the powers of a\r\ncrown? Did they say that liberty was suspended? Did they say that men\r\nmight be deprived of the right of trial by jury? Did they say that men\r\nmight be torn from their homes by midnight intruders?... If you would\r\nsave your country and your liberties, begin at the hearthstone; begin\r\nin your family circle; declare that their rights shall be held sacred;\r\nand having once proclaimed your own rights, claim for your own State\r\nthat jurisdiction and that government which we, better than all\r\nothers, can exercise for ourselves, for we best know our own\r\ninterests.\"[899]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 898: Couch's report, _Official Records_, Vol. 27, Part 2,\r\n214.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 899: Horatio Seymour, _Public Record_, pp. 118-124.\r\n\r\nTen days later, in the midst of riot and bloodshed, the _World_ said:\r\n\"Will the insensate men at Washington now give ear to our warnings?\r\nWill they now believe that defiance of law in the rulers breeds\r\ndefiance of law in the people? Does the doctrine that in war laws are\r\nsilent, please them when put in practice in the streets of New\r\nYork?\"--New York _World_, July 14, 1863.]\r\n\r\nOne week later, on Saturday, July 11, the draft began in the Ninth\r\nCongressional District of New York, a portion of the city settled by\r\nlabourers, largely of foreign birth. These people, repeating the\r\ninformation gained in neighbourhood discussions, violently denounced\r\nthe Conscription Act as illegal, claiming that the privilege of buying\r\nan exemption on payment of $300 put \"the rich man's money against the\r\npoor man's blood.\" City authorities apprehended trouble and State\r\nofficials were notified of the threatened danger, but only the police\r\nheld themselves in readiness. The Federal Government, in the absence\r\nof a request from the Governor, very properly declined to make an\r\nexception in the application of the law in New York on the mere\r\nassumption that violence would occur. Besides, all available troops,\r\nincluding most of the militia regiments, had been sent to\r\nPennsylvania, and to withdraw them would weaken the Federal lines\r\nabout Gettysburg.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance began at the corner of Forty-sixth Street and Third\r\nAvenue, the rioters destroying the building in which the\r\nprovost-marshal was conducting the draft. By this time the mob, having\r\ngrown into an army, began to sack and murder. Prejudice against\r\nnegroes sent the rioters into hotels and restaurants after the\r\nwaiters, some of whom were beaten to death, while others, hanged on\r\ntrees and lamp-posts, were burned while dying. The coloured orphan\r\nasylum, fortunately after its inmates had escaped, likewise became\r\nfuel for the flames. The police were practically powerless. Street\r\ncars and omnibuses ceased to run, shopkeepers barred their doors,\r\nworkmen dropped their tools, teamsters put up their horses, and for\r\nthree days all business was stopped. In the meantime Federal and State\r\nauthorities coöperated to restore order. Governor Seymour, having\r\nhastened from Long Branch, addressed a throng of men and boys from the\r\nsteps of the City Hall, calling them \"friends,\" and pleading with\r\nthem to desist. He also issued two proclamations, declaring the city\r\nin a state of insurrection, and commanding all people to obey the laws\r\nand the legal authorities. Finally, the militia regiments from\r\nPennsylvania began to arrive, and cannon and howitzers raked the\r\nstreets. These quieting influences, coupled with the publication of an\r\nofficial notice that the draft had been suspended, put an end to the\r\nmost exciting experience of any Northern community during the war.\r\n\r\nAfter the excitement the _Tribune_ asserted that the riot resulted\r\nfrom a widespread treasonable conspiracy,[900] and a letter, addressed\r\nto the President, related the alleged confession of a well-known\r\npolitician, who, overcome with remorse, had revealed to the editors of\r\nthe _Tribune_ the complicity of Seymour. Lincoln placed no reliance in\r\nthe story, \"for which,\" says Hay, \"there was no foundation in\r\nfact;\"[901] but Seymour's speech \"intimated,\" says the Lincoln\r\nhistorian, \"that the draft justified the riot, and that if the rioters\r\nwould cease their violence the draft should be stopped.\"[902] James B.\r\nFry, provost-marshal general, substantially endorsed this view. \"While\r\nthe riot was going on,\" he says, \"Governor Seymour insisted on Colonel\r\nNugent announcing a suspension of the draft. The draft had already\r\nbeen stopped by violence. The announcement was urged by the Governor,\r\nno doubt, because he thought it would allay the excitement; but it\r\nwas, under the circumstances, making a concession to the mob, and\r\nendangering the successful enforcement of the law of the land.\"[903]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 900: New York _Tribune_, July 15, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 901: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 7, p. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 902: _Ibid._, p. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 903: James B. Fry, _New York and the Conscription_, p. 33.]\r\n\r\nOf the four reports of Seymour's speech, published the morning after\r\nits delivery, no two are alike.[904] Three, however, concur in his use\r\nof the word \"friends,\"[905] and all agree that he spoke of trying to\r\nsecure a postponement of the draft that justice might be done. It was\r\na delicate position in which he placed himself, and one that ever\r\nafter gave him and his supporters much embarrassment and cause for\r\nmany apologies. Nevertheless, his action in nowise impugned his\r\npatriotism. Assuming the riot had its inception in the belief which he\r\nhimself entertained, that the draft was illegal and unjust, he sought\r\nby personal appeal to stay the destruction of life and property, and\r\nif anyone in authority at that time had influence with the rioters and\r\ntheir sympathisers it was Horatio Seymour, who probably accomplished\r\nless than he hoped to.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 904: New York _Tribune_, _Herald_, _Times_, and _World_,\r\nJuly 15; also, _Public Record of Horatio Seymour_, pp. 127-128.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 905: New York _Tribune_, _Herald_, and _Times_.]\r\n\r\nSeymour's views in relation to the draft first appeared in August.\r\nWhile the Federal authorities prepared the enrolment in June, the\r\nGovernor, although his coöperation was sought, \"gave no assistance,\"\r\nsays Fry. \"In fact, so far as the government officers engaged in the\r\nenrolment could learn, he gave the subject no attention.\"[906] On the\r\nday the drawing began, however, he became apprehensive of trouble and\r\nsent his adjutant to Washington to secure a suspension of the draft,\r\nbut the records do not reveal the reasons presented by that officer.\r\nCertainly no complaint was made as to the correctness of the enrolment\r\nor the assignment of quotas.[907] Nevertheless, his delay taught him a\r\nlesson, and when the Federal authorities notified him later that the\r\ndrawing would be resumed in August, he lost no time in beginning the\r\nnow historic correspondence with the President. His letter of August 3\r\nasked that the suspension of the draft be continued to enable the\r\nState officials to correct the enrolment, and to give the United\r\nStates Supreme Court opportunity to pass upon the constitutionality of\r\nthe Conscription Act, suggesting the hope that in the meantime New\r\nYork's quota might be filled by volunteers. \"It is believed by at\r\nleast one-half of the people of the loyal States,\" he wrote, \"that the\r\nConscription Act, which they are called upon to obey, is in itself a\r\nviolation of the supreme constitutional law.... In the minds of the\r\nAmerican people the duty of obedience and the rights to protection are\r\ninseparable. If it is, therefore, proposed on the one hand to exact\r\nobedience at the point of the bayonet, and, upon the other hand, to\r\nshut off, by military power, all approach to our judicial tribunals,\r\nwe have reason to fear the most ruinous results.\"[908]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 906: James B. Fry, _New York and the Conscription_, p. 14.\r\n\"Seymour showed his lack of executive ability by not filling up the\r\nquota of New York by volunteers in less than a month after the\r\nConscription Act was passed. This a clever executive could easily have\r\ndone and so avoided all trouble.\"--New York _Herald_, September 11,\r\n1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 907: James B. Fry, _New York and the Conscription_, p. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 908: _The Public Record of Horatio Seymour_, p. 153.]\r\n\r\nThis letter was neither gracious nor candid. While dealing in columns\r\nof figures to prove the inaccuracy of the enrolment, it concealed the\r\nfact that, although urged to coöperate with the enrolling officers, he\r\nhad ignored their invitation to verify the enrolment. In menacing\r\ntones, too, he intimated \"the consequences of a violent, harsh policy,\r\nbefore the constitutionality of the Act is tested.\" It was evident he\r\nhad given much thought to the question, but his prolixity betrayed the\r\nfeeling of an official who, conscious of having erred in doing nothing\r\nin anticipation of riot and bloodshed, wished now to make a big\r\nshowing of duty performed.\r\n\r\nLincoln's reply not only emphasised the difference between the\r\npolitical aptitude of himself and Seymour, but marked him as the more\r\nmagnanimous and far the greater man. The President raised no issue as\r\nto enrolments, wasted no arguments over columns of figures, and\r\nreferred in nowise to the past. He briefly outlined a method of\r\nverification which quickly established,--what might have been shown in\r\nJune had the Governor given the matter attention,--an excess of 13,000\r\nmen enrolled in the Brooklyn and New York districts. Although he would\r\nbe glad, said Lincoln, to facilitate a decision of the Court and\r\nabide by it,[909] he declined longer to delay the draft \"because time\r\nis too important.... We are contending with an enemy who, as I\r\nunderstand, drives every able-bodied man he can reach into his ranks,\r\nvery much as a butcher drives bullocks into a slaughter-pen. No time\r\nis wasted, no argument is used. This produces an army which will soon\r\nturn upon our now victorious soldiers already in the field, if they\r\nare not sustained by recruits as they should be.\"[910]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 909: The constitutionality of the Conscription Act of March\r\n3, 1863, was affirmed by the United States Circuit Courts of\r\nPennsylvania and Illinois.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 910: _The Public Record of Horatio Seymour_, p. 156.]\r\n\r\nWhen the drawing was resumed on August 19, 10,000 infantry and three\r\nbatteries of artillery, picked troops from the Army of the Potomac,\r\nbeside a division of the State National Guard, backed the Governor's\r\nproclamation counselling submission to the execution of the law. In\r\nthis presence the draft proceeded peacefully.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the loyal millions of the North, longing for victory in the\r\nfield, found their prayers answered. Gettysburg and Vicksburg had\r\npierced the spirit of the South, Cumberland Gap had liberated East\r\nTennessee, Fort Smith and Little Rock supplied a firm footing for the\r\narmy beyond the Mississippi, and the surrender of Port Hudson\r\npermitted Federal gunboats to pass unvexed to the sea. The rift in the\r\nwar cloud had, indeed, let in a flood of sunlight, and, while it\r\nlasted, gave fresh courage and larger faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSEYMOUR REBUKED\r\n\r\n1863\r\n\r\n\r\nThe victories of Vicksburg and Gettysburg turned the Republican Union\r\nconvention, held at Syracuse on September 2, into a meeting of\r\nrejoicing. Weed did not attend, but the Conservatives, led by Henry J.\r\nRaymond and Edwin D. Morgan, boldly talked of its control. Ward Hunt\r\nbecame temporary chairman. Hunt was a lawyer whom politics did not\r\nattract. Since his unsuccessful effort to become a United States\r\nsenator in 1857 he had turned aside from his profession only when\r\nnecessary to strengthen the cause of the Union. At such times he shone\r\nas the representative of a wise patriotism. He did not belong in the\r\nclass of attractive platform speakers, nor possess the weaknesses of\r\nblind followers of party chieftains. His power rested upon the\r\nstrength of his character as a well-poised student of affairs. What he\r\nbelieved came forcefully from a mind that formed its own judgments,\r\nand whether his words gave discomfort to the little souls that\r\ngoverned caucuses, or to the great journalists that sought to force\r\ntheir own policies, he was in no wise disturbed.\r\n\r\nUpon taking the chair Hunt began his remarks in the tone of one who\r\nfelt more than he desired to express, but as the mention of Gettysburg\r\nand Vicksburg revealed the unbounded enthusiasm of the men before him,\r\nthe optimism that characterised the people's belief in the summer of\r\n1863 quickly took possession of him, and he coupled with the\r\ndeclaration that the rebel armies were nearly destroyed, the opinion\r\nthat peace was near at hand. For the moment the party seemed solidly\r\nunited. But when the echoes of long continued cheering had subsided\r\nthe bitterness of faction flashed out with increased intensity. To the\r\nRadicals, Raymond's suggestion of Edwin D. Morgan for permanent\r\nchairman was as gall and wormwood, and his talk of an entire new\r\nticket most alarming. However, George Opdyke and Horace Greeley, the\r\nRadical leaders, chastened by the defeat of Wadsworth and the election\r\nof Morgan to the Senate, did not now forget the value of discretion.\r\nHunt's selection as temporary chairman had been a concession, and in\r\nthe choice of a permanent presiding officer, although absolutely\r\nunyielding in their hostility to Morgan, they graciously accepted\r\nAbraham Wakeman, an apostle of the conservative school.[911] Their\r\nattitude toward Morgan, however, cost Opdyke a place on the State\r\nCommittee, and for a time threatened to exclude the Radicals from\r\nrecognition upon the ticket.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 911: Wakeman was postmaster at New York City.]\r\n\r\nThe refusal of men to accept nominations greatly embarrassed\r\nConservatives in harvesting their victory. Thomas W. Olcott of Albany\r\nwas nominated for comptroller in place of Lucius Robinson. Of all the\r\ndistinguished men who had filled that office none exhibited a more\r\ninflexible firmness than Robinson in holding the public purse strings.\r\nHe was honest by nature and by practice. Neither threats nor ingenious\r\ndevices disturbed him, but with a fidelity as remarkable as it was\r\nrare he pushed aside the emissaries of extravagance and corruption as\r\nreadily as a plow turns under the sod. After two years of such\r\nmethods, however, the representatives of a wide-open treasury noisily\r\ndemanded a change. But Olcott, a financier of wide repute, wisely\r\ndeclined to be used for such a purpose, and Robinson was accepted.\r\n\r\nDaniel S. Dickinson, after the inconsequential treatment accorded him\r\nin the recent contest for United States senator, suddenly discovered\r\nthat domestic reasons disabled him from serving longer as\r\nattorney-general. Then James T. Brady declined, although tendered the\r\nnomination without a dissenting voice. This reduced the convention,\r\nin its search for a conspicuous War Democrat, to the choice of John\r\nCochrane, the well-known orator who had left the army in the preceding\r\nFebruary. In choosing a Secretary of State the embarrassment\r\ncontinued. Greeley encouraged the candidacy of Chauncey M. Depew, but\r\nconcluded, at the last moment, that Peter A. Porter, the colonel of a\r\nregiment and a son of the gallant general of the war of 1812, must\r\nhead the ticket.[912] Porter, however, refused to exchange a military\r\nfor a civil office, and Depew was substituted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 912: \"Porter received 213 votes to 140 for Depew, who made a\r\nremarkable run under the circumstances.\"--New York _Herald_, September\r\n3, 1863.\r\n\r\n\"Greeley sent for me some weeks before the convention and pressed me\r\nwith such vigour to take a position upon the State ticket that I\r\nfinally consented. He then secured from practically the whole State an\r\nendorsement of the suggestion on my behalf. On the morning of the\r\nconvention he suddenly decided that some one connected with the army\r\nmust be chosen and sent around an order for a change of programme just\r\nbefore the roll was called. It was the most fortunate thing that could\r\nhave happened to me, but created widespread distrust of his qualities\r\nas a leader.\"--Speech of Chauncey M. Depew, April 4, 1902. _Addresses\r\nof_, November, 1896, to April, 1902, pp. 238-239.]\r\n\r\nDepew, then a young man of twenty-nine, gave promise of his subsequent\r\nbrilliant career. He lived a neighbour to Horace Greeley, whom he\r\ngreatly admired, and to whom he tactfully spoke the honeyed words,\r\nalways so agreeable to the _Tribune's_ editor.[913] Perhaps no one in\r\nthe State possessed a more pleasing personality. He made other people\r\nas happy as he was himself. To this charm of manner were added a\r\nsingularly attractive presence, a pleasing voice, and the oratorical\r\ngifts that won him recognition even before he left Yale College. From\r\nthe first he exhibited a marked capacity for public life. He had an\r\nunfailing readiness, a wide knowledge of affairs, a keen sense of the\r\nridiculous, and a flow of clear and easy language which never failed\r\nto give full and precise expression to all that was in his mind. He\r\nrarely provoked enmities, preferring light banter to severe invective\r\nor unsparing ridicule. Among his associates he was the prince of\r\nraconteurs. In conventions few men were heard with keener interest,\r\nand every Republican recognised the fact that a new force had come\r\ninto the councils of the party. There never was a time when people\r\nregarded him as \"a coming man,\" for he took a leading place at once.\r\nIn 1861, three years after his admission to the bar, the Peekskill\r\nvoters sent him to the Assembly, and the next year his colleagues\r\nselected him for speaker, an honour which he generously relinquished\r\nthat his party might elect a United States senator. Now, within the\r\nsame year, he found a place at the head of the ticket, which he led\r\nduring the campaign with marked ability.[914]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 913: \"So far as politics were concerned, Greeley's\r\naffections seemed to be lavished on politicians who flattered and\r\ncoddled him. Of this the rise of Governor Fenton was a striking\r\nexample.\"--Andrew D. White, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 160.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 914: The State ticket was as follows: Secretary of state,\r\nChauncey M. Depew of Westchester; Comptroller, Lucius Robinson of\r\nChemung; Canal Commissioner, Benjamin F. Bruce of Madison; Treasurer,\r\nGeorge W. Schuyler of Tompkins; State Engineer, William B. Taylor of\r\nOneida; Prison Inspector, James K. Bates of Jefferson; Judge of\r\nAppeals, Henry S. Selden of Monroe; Attorney-General, John Cochrane of\r\nNew York.]\r\n\r\nThe platform endorsed the Administration, praised the soldiers,\r\nopposed a peace that changed the Constitution except in the form\r\nprescribed by it, deplored the creation of a spirit of partisan\r\nhostility against the Government, and promised that New York would do\r\nits full share in maintaining the Union; but it skilfully avoided\r\nmentioning the conscription act and the emancipation proclamation,\r\nwhich Seymour charged had changed the war for the Union into a war for\r\nabolition. When a delegate, resenting the omission, moved a resolution\r\ncommending emancipation, Raymond reminded him that he was in a Union,\r\nnot a Republican convention, and that many loyal men doubted the\r\npropriety of such an endorsement. This position proved too\r\nconservative for the ordinary up-State delegate, and a motion to table\r\nthe resolution quickly failed. Thereupon Charles A. Folger of Geneva\r\nmoved to amend by adding the words, \"and as a war measure is\r\nthoroughly legal and justifiable.\" Probably no man in the convention,\r\nby reason of his learning and solidity of character, had greater\r\ninfluence. In 1854 he left the Democratic party with Ward Hunt, whom\r\nhe resembled as a lawyer, and whom he was to follow to the Court of\r\nAppeals and like him attain the highest eminence. Just then he was\r\nforty-five years old, a State senator of gentle bearing and stout\r\nheart, who dared to express his positive convictions, and whose\r\nsuggested amendment, offered with the firmness of a man conscious of\r\nbeing in the right, encountered slight opposition.\r\n\r\nThe President's letter, addressed to the Union convention of New York,\r\ngave the Radicals great comfort. With direct and forceful language\r\nLincoln took the people into his confidence. There are but three ways,\r\nhe said, to stop the war; first, by suppressing rebellion, which he\r\nwas trying to do; second, by giving up the Union, which he was trying\r\nto prevent; and third, by some imaginable compromise, which was\r\nimpossible if it embraced the maintenance of the Union. The strength\r\nof the rebellion is in its army, which dominates all the country and\r\nall the people within its range. Any offer of terms made by men within\r\nthat range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the\r\npresent, because such men have no power whatever to enforce their side\r\nof a compromise if one were made with them. Suppose refugees from the\r\nSouth and peace men from the North hold a convention of the States,\r\nhow can their action keep Lee out of Pennsylvania? To be effective a\r\ncompromise must come from those in control of the rebel army, or from\r\nthe people after our army has suppressed that army. As no suggestion\r\nof peace has yet come from that source, all thought of peace for the\r\npresent was out of the question. If any proposition shall hereafter\r\ncome, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you.\r\n\r\nTo be plain, he continued, you are dissatisfied about the negro. You\r\nopposed compensated emancipation and you dislike proclaimed\r\nemancipation. If slaves are property, is there any question that by\r\nthe law of war such property, both of enemies and friends, may be\r\ntaken when needed? And is it not needed when its taking helps us and\r\nhurts our enemy? But you say the proclamation is unconstitutional. If\r\nit is not valid, it needs no retraction. If it is valid, it cannot be\r\nretracted any more than the dead can be brought to life. You profess\r\nto think its retraction would help the Union. Why better _after_ the\r\nretraction than _before_ the issue? Those in revolt had one hundred\r\ndays to consider it, and the war, since its issuance, has progressed\r\nas favourably for us as before. Some of the commanders who have won\r\nour most important victories believe the emancipation policy the\r\nheaviest blow yet dealt to the rebels, and that in one instance, at\r\nleast, victory came with the aid of black soldiers. You say you will\r\nnot fight to free negroes. Whenever you are urged, after resistance to\r\nthe Union is conquered, to continue to fight, it will be time enough\r\nto refuse. Do you not think, in the struggle for the Union, that the\r\nwithdrawal of negro help from the enemy weakens his resistance to you?\r\nThat what negroes can do as soldiers leaves so much less for white\r\nsoldiers to do? But why should negroes do anything for us, if we will\r\ndo nothing for them? and if they, on the promise of freedom, stake\r\ntheir lives to save the Union, shall the promise not be kept?\r\n\r\nThe signs look better, he concluded. Peace does not appear so distant\r\nas it did. When it comes, it will prove that no appeal lies from the\r\nballot to the bullet, and that those who take it are sure to lose\r\ntheir case and pay the costs. \"And then there will be some black men\r\nwho can remember that, with silent tongue, and clenched teeth, and\r\nsteady eye, and well poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to\r\nthis great consummation; while I fear there will be some white ones\r\nunable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they\r\nhave striven to hinder it.\"[915]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 915: New York _Herald_, September 3, 1863.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of this letter, increased by the dignity and power of\r\nthe President's office, proved a sharp thorn to the Democrats. Recent\r\nmilitary successes had made it appear for the time, at least, that\r\nrebellion was about to collapse, and the Democratic State Union\r\nconvention, which convened at Albany on September 9, shifted its\r\npolicy from a protest against war measures to an appeal for\r\nconciliation. In other words, it was against subjugation, which would\r\nnot leave \"the Union as it was, and the Constitution as it is.\" In its\r\neffort to emphasise this plea it refused to recognise or affiliate\r\nwith the Constitutional Union party, controlled by James Brooks and\r\nother extreme peace advocates,[916] and although its platform still\r\ncondemned emancipation, conscription, and arbitrary arrests, the\r\npivotal declaration, based on \"manifestations of a returning\r\nallegiance on the part of North Carolina and other seceded States,\"\r\nfavoured a wise statesmanship \"which shall encourage the Union\r\nsentiment of the South and unite more thoroughly the people of the\r\nNorth.\" Amasa J. Parker, chairman of the convention, who still talked\r\nof a \"yawning gulf of ruin,\" admitted that such a policy brought a\r\ngleam of hope to the country, and Governor Seymour, at the end of a\r\ndreary speech explanatory of his part in the draft-riot,[917]\r\nexpressed a willingness to \"bury violations of law and the rights of\r\nStates and individuals if such a magnanimous course shall be\r\npursued.\"[918] Lincoln's letter, however, unexpectedly spoiled such an\r\nappeal, compelling the convention to \"regret\" that the President\r\ncontemplates no measure for the restoration of the Union, \"but looking\r\nto an indefinite protraction of the war for abolition purposes points\r\nto no future save national bankruptcy and the subversion of our\r\ninstitutions.\"[919]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 916: The Constitutional Union convention, meeting at Albany\r\non September 8, named candidates for attorney-general and prison\r\ninspector, with the request that the Democratic convention endorse\r\nthem; otherwise it would put a full ticket into the field. Among its\r\nState Committee appeared the names of former governor Washington Hunt\r\nand Lorenzo Burrows. It resolved to resist all departures from the\r\nstrict letter of the Constitution, whether based upon military\r\nnecessity or a usurpation of doubtful powers.\r\n\r\n\"We tender the Democratic State convention our hearty thanks for their\r\ncontemptuous treatment of Jim Brooks & Co.'s one-horse concern,\r\nconsisting of fifteen or twenty officers and three or four privates.\r\nThat concern is thoroughly bogus--a barefaced imposture which should\r\nbe squelched and its annual nuisance abated.\"--New York _Tribune_,\r\nSeptember 11, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 917: \"Governor Seymour can talk more without saying\r\nanything, and write more without meaning anything, than any other man\r\nwe know.... We consider Seymour not much of a man, and no Governor at\r\nall.\"--New York _Herald_ (editorial), September 11, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 918: _Ibid._, September 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 919: The ticket was made up as follows: Secretary of state,\r\nDavid B.

Lewis of\r\nKings; Canal Commissioner, William W. Wright, of Ontario; Inspector of\r\nPrisons, David B. McNeil of Clinton; Judge of Appeals, William F.\r\nAllen, of Oswego.--_Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThe Republicans, backed by success in the field, started with an\r\nadvantage which the cheering news from Maine strengthened. It soon\r\nbecome manifest, too, that the Gibraltar of Democracy resented the\r\ndestructive work of mobs and rioters. Criticism of Seymour also became\r\ndrastic. \"He hobnobbed with the copperhead party in Connecticut,\" said\r\nthe _Herald_, \"and lost that election; he endorsed Vallandigham, and\r\ndid nothing during the riot but talk. He has let every opportunity\r\npass and rejected all offers that would prove him the man for the\r\nplace. The sooner he is dropped as incompetent, the better it will be\r\nfor the ticket.\"[920] The _Tribune_ imputed nepotism. \"His brother,\"\r\nit said, \"gets $200 per month as agent, a nephew $150 as an officer,\r\nand two nephews and a cousin $1,000 a year each as clerks in the\r\nexecutive departments.\"[921] But Martin I. Townsend, at a great mass\r\nmeeting in New York City, presented the crushing indictment against\r\nhim. Although the clock had tolled the midnight hour, the large\r\naudience remained to hear Townsend for the same reason, suggested\r\nEdwin D. Morgan, the chairman, that the disciples sat up all night\r\nwhenever the great apostle was with them. Townsend was then\r\nfifty-three years old. For more than a decade his rare ability as a\r\nspeaker had kept him a favorite, and for a quarter of a century longer\r\nhe was destined to delight the people. On this occasion, however, his\r\narraignment left a deeper and more lasting impression than his words\r\nordinarily did. \"Seymour,\" he said, \"undertook to increase enlistments\r\nby refusing the soldier his political franchise. On the supposition\r\nthat Meade would be defeated, he delivered a Fourth of July address\r\nthat indicted the free people of the North and placed him in the front\r\nrank of men whom rebels delight to honour. If there was a traitor in\r\nNew York City on that day he was in the company of Horatio Seymour.\r\nFinally, he pronounced as 'friends' the men, who, stirred to action by\r\nhis incendiary words, applied the torch and the bludgeon in the draft\r\nriot of July 13, 14, and 15.\"[922]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 920: _Ibid._, September 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 921: New York _Tribune_, October 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 922: New York _Tribune_, October 1, 1863.]\r\n\r\nIn the four speeches delivered in the campaign, Seymour was never\r\ncleverer or more defiant.[923] He exhibited great skill in criticising\r\nthe Administration, charging that disasters had brought bankruptcy,\r\nthat ill-advised acts of subordinates had sapped the liberties of the\r\npeople, and that base motives inspired the policy of the Government.\r\nHe denounced the Radicals as craven Americans, devoid of patriotic\r\nfeeling, who were trying to make the humiliation and degradation of\r\ntheir country a stepping-stone to continued power. \"They say we must\r\nfight until slavery is extinguished. We are to upturn the foundations\r\nof our Constitution. At this very moment, when the fate of the nation\r\nand of individuals trembles in the balance, these madmen ask us to\r\nplunge into a bottomless pit of controversy upon indefinite purposes.\r\nDoes not every man know that we must have a united North to triumph?\r\nCan we get a united North upon a theory that the Constitution can be\r\nset aside at the will of one man, because, forsooth, he judges it to\r\nbe a military necessity? I never yet heard that Abraham Lincoln was a\r\nmilitary necessity.... The Vice-President says, 'There are men in your\r\nmidst who want the Union as it was and the Constitution as it is,' and\r\nhe adds, sneeringly, 'They can't have it.' We will tell him there are\r\nmany such men, and we say to him we will have it. There has never been\r\na sentiment in the North or South put forth more treasonable,\r\ncowardly, and base than this.\" Referring to the President's call, on\r\nOctober 17, for 300,000 volunteers, to be followed by a draft if not\r\npromptly filled, he exclaimed: \"Again, 600,000 men are called\r\nfor--600,000 homes to be entered. The young man will be compelled to\r\ngive up the cornerstone of his fortune, which he has laid away with\r\ntoil and care, to begin the race of life. The old man will pay that\r\nwhich he has saved, as the support of his declining years, to rescue\r\nhis son. In God's name, let these operations be fair if they must be\r\ncruel.\" In conclusion he professed undying loyalty. \"We love that flag\r\n[pointing to the Stars and Stripes] with the whole love of our life,\r\nand every star that glitters on its blue field is sacred. And we will\r\npreserve the Constitution, we will preserve the Union, we will\r\npreserve our flag with every star upon it, and we will see to it that\r\nthere is a State for every star.\"[924]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 923: Seymour spoke at Buffalo, Syracuse, Utica, and New York\r\nCity, on October 26, 28, 29, and 31 respectively.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 924: _Record of Horatio Seymour_, pp. 168-176.]\r\n\r\nIn their extremity Dean Richmond and Peter Cagger, taking advantage of\r\nthe President's call for more troops, issued a circular on the eve of\r\nelection, alleging that the State would receive no credit for drafted\r\nmen commuted; that towns which had furnished their quotas would be\r\nsubject to a new conscription; and that men having commuted were\r\nliable to be immediately drafted again.[925] This was the prototype of\r\nBurchard's \"Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion\" in 1884, and might have\r\nbecome no less disastrous had not the Provost-marshal General quickly\r\ncontradicted it. As a parting shot, Seward, speaking at Auburn on the\r\nnight before election, declared that if the ballot box could be passed\r\nthrough the camps of the Confederate soldiers, every man would vote\r\nfor the administration of our government by Horatio Seymour and\r\nagainst the administration of Abraham Lincoln.[926]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 925: New York _Tribune_, November 2, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 926: New York _Herald_, November 6, 1863.]\r\n\r\nThe October elections foreshadowed the result in November. Although\r\nthe Democrats had derived great advantage in 1862 because of their\r\nbold stand for civil liberty and freedom of speech, a year later such\r\narguments proved of little avail. Gettysburg and Vicksburg had turned\r\nthe tide, and Seymour and the draft riot carried it to the flood.\r\nDepew's majority, mounting higher and higher as the returns came\r\nslowly from the interior, turned the Governor's surprise into shame.\r\nIn his career of a quarter of a century Seymour had learned to accept\r\ndisappointment as well as success, but his failure in 1863 to forecast\r\nthe trend of changing public sentiment cost him the opportunity of\r\never again leading his party to victory.[927]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 927: \"Depew received 29,405 votes more than St. John for\r\nsecretary of state.\" _Ibid._, December 5, 1863.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSTRIFE OF RADICAL AND CONSERVATIVE\r\n\r\n1864\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his Auburn speech Seward had declared for Lincoln's\r\nrenomination.[928] Proof of the intimate personal relations existing\r\nbetween the President and his Secretary came into national notice in\r\n1862 when a committee of nine Radical senators, charging to Seward's\r\nconservatism the failure of a vigorous and successful prosecution of\r\nthe war, formally demanded his dismissal from the Cabinet. On learning\r\nof their action the Secretary had immediately resigned. \"Do you still\r\nthink Seward ought to be excused?\" asked Lincoln at the end of a long\r\nand stormy interview. Four answered \"Yes,\" three declined to vote, and\r\nHarris of New York said \"No.\"[929] The result of this conference led\r\nSecretary Chase, the chief of the Radicals, to tender his resignation\r\nalso. But the President, \"after most anxious consideration,\" requested\r\neach to resume the duties of his department. Speaking of the matter\r\nafterward to Senator Harris, Lincoln declared with his usual\r\nmirth-provoking illustration: \"If I had yielded to that storm and\r\ndismissed Seward, the thing would all have slumped one way. Now I can\r\nride; I have got a pumpkin in each end of my bag.\"[930]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 928: Delivered November 3, 1863. New York _Herald_, November\r\n6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 929: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 6, p. 266.\r\nSenators Sumner of Massachusetts, Trumbull of Illinois, Grimes of\r\nIowa, and Pomeroy of Kansas, voted Yes; Collamer of Vermont, Fessenden\r\nof Maine, and Howard of Michigan declined to vote. Wade of Ohio was\r\nabsent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 930: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 6, p. 268.]\r\n\r\nOther causes than loyalty contributed to the President's regard for\r\nSeward. In their daily companionship the latter took a genial,\r\nphilosophical view of the national struggle, not shared by all his\r\nCabinet associates, while Lincoln dissipated the gloom with quaint\r\nillustrations of Western life.[931] At one of these familiar fireside\r\ntalks the President expressed the hope that Seward might be his\r\nsuccessor, adding that the friends so grievously disappointed at\r\nChicago would thus find all made right at last. To this Seward, in his\r\nclear-headed and kind-hearted way, replied: \"No, that is all past and\r\nended. The logic of events requires you to be your own successor. You\r\nwere elected in 1860, but the Southern States refused to submit. They\r\nthought the decision made at the polls could be reversed in the field.\r\nThey are still in arms, and their hope now is that you and your party\r\nwill be voted down at the next election. When that election is held\r\nand they find the people reaffirming their decision to have you\r\nPresident, I think the rebellion will collapse.\"[932]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 931: Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 3, p. 197.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 932: _Ibid._, p. 196.]\r\n\r\nUnlike Seward, Thurlow Weed wabbled in his loyalty to the President.\r\nChafing under the retention of Hiram C. Barney as collector of\r\ncustoms, Weed thought Lincoln too tolerant of Radicals whose\r\nopposition was ill concealed. \"They will all be against him in '64,\"\r\nhe wrote David Davis, then an associate justice of the United States\r\nSupreme Court. \"Why does he persist in giving them weapons with which\r\nthey may defeat his renomination?\"[933] Barney had become a burden to\r\nLincoln, who really desired to be rid of him. Many complaints of\r\nirregularity disclosed corrupt practices which warranted a change for\r\nthe public good. Besides, said the President, \"the establishment was\r\nbeing run almost exclusively in the interest of the Radicals. I felt\r\ngreat delicacy in doing anything that might be offensive to my friend.\r\nAnd yet something had to be done. I told Seward he must find him a\r\ndiplomatic position. Just then Chase became aware of my little\r\nconspiracy. He was very angry and told me the day Barney left the\r\ncustom house, with or without his own consent, he would withdraw from\r\nthe Treasury. So I backed down.\"[934]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 933: T.W. Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 434.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 934: Maunsell B. Field, _Memories of Many Men_, p. 304.]\r\n\r\nLincoln's tolerance did not please Weed, whose infrequent calls at the\r\nWhite House had not escaped notice. \"I have been brought to fear\r\nrecently,\" the President wrote with characteristic tenderness, \"that\r\nsomehow, by commission or omission, I have caused you some degree of\r\npain. I have never entertained an unkind feeling or a disparaging\r\nthought towards you; and if I have said or done anything which has\r\nbeen construed into such unkindness or disparagement it has been\r\nmisconstrued. I am sure if we could meet we would not part with any\r\nunpleasant impression on either side.\"[935] Such a letter from such a\r\nman stirred the heart of the iron-willed boss, who hastened to\r\nWashington. He had much to say. Among other things he unfolded a plan\r\nfor peace. It proposed full amnesty to all persons engaged in the war\r\nand an armistice for ninety days, during which time such citizens of\r\nthe Confederate States as embrace the offered pardon \"shall, as a\r\nState or States, or as citizens thereof, be restored in all respects\r\nto the rights, privileges, and prerogatives which they enjoyed before\r\ntheir secession from the Union.\" If, however, such offer is rejected,\r\nthe authority of the United States denied, and the war against the\r\nUnion continued, the President should partition all territory, whether\r\nfarms, villages, or cities, among the officers and soldiers conquering\r\nthe same.[936]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 935: Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 440.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 936: _Ibid._, p. 437.]\r\n\r\nIn presenting this plan Weed argued that if the offer was rejected it\r\nwould secure \"a united North in favour of war to the knife.\" Besides,\r\nthe armistice, occurring when the season interrupts active army\r\nmovements, would cause little delay and give ample time for widespread\r\ncirculation of the proclamation. Respecting the division of lands\r\namong soldiers, he said it would stop desertion, avoid the payment of\r\nbounties, and quickly fill the army with enterprising yeomen who would\r\nwant homes after the termination of hostilities. It had long been\r\npractised in maritime wars by all civilized nations, he said, and\r\nbeing a part of international law it could not in reason be objected\r\nto, especially as the sufferers would have rejected most liberal\r\noffers of peace and prosperity. Weed frankly admitted that Seward did\r\nnot like the scheme, and that Senator Wilson of Massachusetts eyed it\r\naskance; but Stanton approved it, he said, and Dean Richmond\r\nauthorised him to say that if fairly carried out the North would be a\r\nunit in support of the war and the rebellion would be crushed within\r\nsix months after the expiration of the armistice.[937]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 937: T.W. Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, pp.\r\n437-439.]\r\n\r\nIn conversation Weed was the most persuasive of men. To a quiet,\r\ngentle, deferential manner, he added a giant's grasp of the subject,\r\npresenting its strong points and marshalling with extraordinary skill\r\nall the details. Nevertheless, the proposition now laid before the\r\nPresident, leaving slavery as it was, could not be accepted. \"The\r\nemancipation proclamation could not be retracted,\" he had said in his\r\nfamous letter to the New York convention, \"any more than the dead\r\ncould be brought to life.\" However, Lincoln did not let the famous\r\neditor depart empty-handed. Barney should be removed, and Weed,\r\nsatisfied with such a scalp, returned home to enter the campaign for\r\nthe President's renomination.[938]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 938: New York _Herald_, May 24, 1864.]\r\n\r\nSomething seemed to be wrong in New York. Other States through\r\nconventions and legislatures had early favored the President's\r\nrenomination, while the Empire State moved slowly. Party machinery\r\nworked well. The Union Central Committee, holding a special meeting on\r\nJanuary 4, 1864 at the residence of Edwin D. Morgan, recommended\r\nLincoln's nomination. \"It is going to be difficult to restrain the\r\nboys,\" said Morgan in a letter to the President, \"and there is not\r\nmuch use in trying to do so.\"[939] On February 23 the Republican State\r\nCommittee also endorsed him, and several Union League clubs spoke\r\nearnestly of his \"prudence, sagacity, comprehension, and\r\nperseverance.\" But the absence of an early State convention, the tardy\r\nselection of delegates to Baltimore, and the failure of the\r\nLegislature to act, did not reveal the enthusiasm evinced in other\r\nCommonwealths. Following the rule adopted elsewhere, resolutions\r\nfavourable to the President's renomination were duly presented to the\r\nAssembly, where they remained unacted upon. Suddenly on January 25 a\r\ncircular, signed by Simeon Draper and issued by the Conference\r\nCommittee of the Union Lincoln Association of New York, proposed that\r\nall citizens of every town and county who favoured Lincoln's\r\nnomination meet in some appropriate place on February 22 and make\r\npublic expression to that fact. Among the twenty-five names attached\r\nappeared those of Moses Taylor and Moses H. Grinnell. This was a new\r\nsystem of tactics. But the legislative resolutions did not advance\r\nbecause of it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 939: _Ibid._, February 7.]\r\n\r\nA month later a letter addressed by several New Yorkers to the\r\nNational Republican Executive Committee requested the postponement of\r\nthe Baltimore convention.[940] \"The country is not now in a position\r\nto enter into a presidential contest,\" it said. \"All parties friendly\r\nto the Government should be united in support of a single candidate.\r\nSuch unanimity cannot at present be obtained. Upon the result of\r\nmeasures adopted to finish the war during the present spring and\r\nsummer will depend the wish of the people to continue their present\r\nleaders, or to exchange them for others. Besides, whatever will tend\r\nto lessen the duration of an acrimonious Presidential campaign will be\r\nan advantage to the country.\"[941] If the sentiment of this letter was\r\nnot new, the number and character of its signers produced a profound\r\nsensation. William Cullen Bryant headed the list, and of the\r\ntwenty-three names, seventeen were leading State senators, among them\r\nCharles J. Folger and James M. Cook. \"This list,\" said the _Tribune_,\r\n\"contains the names of two-thirds of the Unionists chosen to our\r\npresent State Senate, the absence of others preventing their signing.\r\nWe understand that but two senators declined to affix their\r\nname.\"[942] Greeley did not sign this letter, but in an earlier\r\ncommunication to the _Independent_ he had urged a postponement of the\r\nconvention.[943] Moreover, he had indicated in the _Tribune_ that\r\nChase, Fremont, Butler, or Grant would make as good a President as\r\nLincoln, while the nomination of either would preserve \"the salutary\r\none-term principle.\"[944]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 940: It was called to meet on June 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 941: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1864, p. 785.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 942: New York _Tribune_, April 25, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 943: New York _Independent_, February 25, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 944: New York _Tribune_, February 23, 1864.]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to determine the cause or the full extent of the\r\ndissatisfaction with Lincoln among New York Republicans. Seward's\r\ninfluence and Weed's relations seriously weakened him. After the\r\nelection of 1862 Radicals openly charged them with Wadsworth's defeat.\r\nFor the same reason the feeling against Edwin D. Morgan had become\r\nintensely bitter. Seeing a newspaper paragraph that these men had been\r\nin consultation with the President about his message, Senator Chandler\r\nof Michigan, the prince of Radicals, wrote a vehement letter to\r\nLincoln, telling him of a \"patriotic organisation in all the free and\r\nborder States, containing to-day over one million of voters, every man\r\nof whom is your friend upon radical measures of your administration;\r\nbut there is not a Seward or a Weed man among them all. These men are\r\na millstone about your neck. You drop them and they are politically\r\nended forever.... Conservatives and traitors are buried together. For\r\nGod's sake don't exhume their remains in your message. They will smell\r\nworse than Lazarus did after he had been buried three days.\"[945]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 945: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 7, p. 389.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Weed had left the President with the promise of aiding him,\r\nhe could accomplish nothing. The Legislature refused to act, demands\r\nfor the postponement of the national convention continued to appear,\r\nand men everywhere resented conservative leadership. This was\r\nespecially true of Greeley and the _Tribune_, Bryant and the _Evening\r\nPost_, and Beecher and the _Independent_, not to mention other\r\nRadicals and radical papers throughout the State, whose opposition\r\nrepresented a formidable combination. Except for this discontent the\r\nCleveland convention would scarcely have been summoned into existence.\r\nOf the three calls issued for its assembling two had their birth in\r\nNew York, one headed by George B. Cheever, the eminent divine, who had\r\nrecently toured England in behalf of the Union,--the other by Lucius\r\nRobinson, State comptroller, and John Cochrane, attorney-general.\r\nCheever's call denounced \"the imbecile and vacillating policy of the\r\npresent Administration in the conduct of the war,\"[946] while Robinson\r\nand Cochrane emphasised the need of a President who \"can suppress\r\nrebellion without infringing the rights of individual or State.\"[947]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 946: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 9, p. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 947: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1864, p. 786.]\r\n\r\nThat Weed no longer possessed the wand of a Warwick was clearly\r\ndemonstrated at the Republican State convention, held at Syracuse on\r\nMay 26, to select delegates to Baltimore. Each faction, led in person\r\nby Greeley and Weed, professed to favour the President's renomination,\r\nbut the fierce and bitter contest over the admission of delegates from\r\nNew York City widened the breach. The Weed machine, following the\r\ncustom of previous years, selected an equal number of delegates from\r\neach ward. The Radicals, who denounced this system as an arbitrary\r\nexpression of bossism, chose a delegation representing each ward in\r\nproportion to the number of its Republican voters. The delegation\r\naccepted would control the convention, and although the Radicals\r\nconsented to the admission of both on equal terms, the Weed forces,\r\nconfident of their strength, refused the compromise. This set the\r\nRadicals to work, and at the morning session, amidst the wildest\r\nconfusion and disorder, they elected Lyman Tremaine temporary chairman\r\nby a majority of six over Chauncey M. Depew, the young secretary of\r\nstate, whose popularity had given the Conservatives an abnormal\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nIn his speech the Chairman commented upon the death of James S.\r\nWadsworth, killed in the battle of the Wilderness on May 6, from whose\r\nobsequies, held at Geneseo on the 21st, many delegates had just\r\nreturned. Tremaine believed that the soldier's blood would \"lie heavy\r\non the souls of those pretended supporters of the government in its\r\nhour of trial, whose cowardice and treachery contributed to his defeat\r\nfor governor.\"[948] In such a spirit he eulogised Wadsworth's\r\ncharacter and patriotism, declaring that if justice had been done him\r\nby the Conservatives, he would now, instead of sleeping in his grave,\r\nbe governor of New York. Although spoken gently and with emotions of\r\nsadness, these intolerably aggressive sentences, loudly applauded by\r\nthe Radicals, stirred the Weed delegates into whispered threats.[949]\r\nBut Tremaine did not rely upon words alone. He packed the committee on\r\ncontested seats, whose report, admitting both city delegations on\r\nequal terms, was accepted by the enormous majority of 192 to 98,\r\nrevealing the fact that the great body of up-State Republicans\r\ndistrusted Thurlow Weed, whose proposition for peace did not include\r\nthe abolition of slavery. Other reasons, however, accounted for the\r\nlarge majority. Tremaine, no longer trusting to the leadership of\r\nGreeley,[950] marshalled the Radical forces with a skill learned in\r\nthe school of Seymour and Dean Richmond, and when his drilled cohorts\r\nwent into action the tumultuous and belligerent character of the\r\nscene resembled the uproar familiar to one who had trained with\r\nTammany and fought with Mozart Hall. In concluding its work the\r\nconvention endorsed the President and selected sixty-six delegates,\r\nheaded by Raymond, Dickinson, Tremaine, and Preston King as\r\ndelegates-at-large.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 948: New York _Tribune_, May 10, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 949: New York _Herald_, May 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 950: \"Greeley received an almost unanimous call to lead the\r\nparty in the State and the first convention which he attended (1862)\r\nbowed absolutely to his will. He thought he was a great political\r\nleader, and he might have been if he had ever been sure of himself;\r\nbut he was one of the poorest judges of men, and in that way was often\r\ndeceived, often misled, and often led to change his opinions.... In\r\nless than two years his power was gone.\"--From speech of Chauncey M.\r\nDepew, April 4, 1902. _Addresses of_, November, 1896, to April, 1902,\r\npp. 238-239.]\r\n\r\nThe echo of the Syracuse contest reached the Cleveland convention,\r\nwhich assembled on May 31. Of all the distinguished New Yorkers whose\r\nnames had advertised and given character to this movement John\r\nCochrane alone attended. Indeed, the picturesque speech of Cochrane,\r\nas chairman, and the vehement letter of Lucius Robinson, advocating\r\nthe nomination of Grant, constituted the only attractive feature of\r\nthe proceedings. Cochrane and Robinson wanted a party in which they\r\ncould feel at home. To Cochrane the Republican party was \"a medley of\r\ntrading, scurvy politicians, which never represented War\r\nDemocrats,\"[951] while Robinson thought the country \"had survived,\r\nthrough three years of war, many bad mistakes of a weak Executive and\r\nCabinet, simply because the popular mind had been intensely fixed upon\r\nthe single purpose of suppressing rebellion.\"[952] Both resented the\r\nAdministration's infringement of individual rights. \"Whoever attacks\r\nthem,\" said Cochrane, \"wounds the vital parts of the Republic. Not\r\neven the plea of necessity allows any one to trample upon them.\"[953]\r\nThe Cleveland convention, however, did not help these statesmen any\r\nmore than the nomination of John C. Fremont and John Cochrane, \"the\r\ntwo Johns from New York\" as they were called, injured the\r\nPresident.[954] When Lincoln heard that instead of the many thousands\r\nexpected only three or four hundred attended, he opened his Bible and\r\nread: \"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in\r\ndebt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto\r\nhim; and he became a captain over them; and there were with him about\r\nfour hundred.\"[955]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 951: Cochrane's speech at Cleveland.

The _Tribune_ and _Times_\r\nwere equally flattering. Even the _World_ admitted that a skilful\r\ngeneral handled the army.[957] Other papers throughout the State\r\nexpressed similar confidence in his victorious leadership, and with\r\nthe hope of changing the sentiment from Lincoln to Grant a great mass\r\nmeeting, called ostensibly to express the country's gratitude to the\r\nlatter, was held in New York City two days before the meeting of the\r\nNational Republican convention. Neither at this time, however, nor at\r\nany other did the movement receive the slightest encouragement from\r\nthe hero of Vicksburg, or shake the loyalty of the delegates who\r\nassembled at Baltimore on June 7.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 956: T.W. Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 443.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 957: See New York _Herald_, April 25, 27, May 7, 9, 14, 16,\r\n18, 23, 26, 28, 29, 31, June 1, 4; New York _Tribune_, May 10, 12, 13,\r\n14; New York _Times_, May 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19; New York _World_,\r\nMay 2, 11, 12, 13, 14.]\r\n\r\nHenry J. Raymond, evidencing the same wise spirit of compromise\r\nexhibited at Syracuse in 1863, reported the platform. It declared the\r\nmaintenance of the Union and the suppression of rebellion by force of\r\narms to be the highest duty of every citizen; it approved the\r\ndetermination of the government to enter into no compromise with\r\nrebels; favoured the abolition of slavery by constitutional amendment;\r\napplauded the wisdom, patriotism, and fidelity of the President;\r\nthanked the soldiers, and claimed the full protection of the laws of\r\nwar for coloured troops; encouraged immigration and the early\r\nconstruction of a railroad to the Pacific coast; pledged the national\r\nfaith to keep inviolate the redemption of the public debt; and opposed\r\nthe establishment, by foreign military forces, of monarchical\r\ngovernments in the near vicinity of the United States.[958] On the\r\nsecond day every State voted for Lincoln for President.[959]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 958: Edward McPherson, _History of the Rebellion_, pp.\r\n406-407.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 959: _Ibid._, p. 407.]\r\n\r\nThe contest for Vice-President renewed the fight of the New York\r\nfactions. An impression had early taken root in the country that a War\r\nDemocrat should be selected, and the Radicals of New York, under the\r\nleadership of Lyman Tremaine, quickly designated Daniel S. Dickinson\r\nas the man. Dickinson's acceptability in New England and New Jersey\r\nstrengthened his candidacy, while its approval by three or four border\r\nand western States seriously weakened Hamlin. Nevertheless, the New\r\nYork Conservatives vigorously opposed him. Their antagonism did not at\r\nfirst concentrate upon any one candidate. Weed talked of Hamlin and\r\nlater of Joseph Holt of Kentucky; Raymond thought Andrew Johnson of\r\nTennessee the stronger; and Preston King, to the great surprise of the\r\nRadicals, agreed with him. This brought from George William Curtis the\r\nsarcastic remark that a Vice-President from the Empire State would\r\nprevent its having a Cabinet officer. Tremaine declared that a change\r\nin the Cabinet would not be a serious calamity to the country, and\r\nPreston King, who attributed his displacement from the United States\r\nSenate to the Seward influence, did not object to the Secretary's\r\nremoval. Thus Raymond's influence gave the doughty War Governor 32 of\r\nNew York's 66 votes to 28 for Dickinson and 6 for Hamlin. This\r\nmaterially aided Johnson's nomination on the first ballot.[960]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 960: Johnson received 200 votes to 108 for Dickinson. After\r\nrecording all changes, the ballot stood: Johnson, 494; Dickinson, 17;\r\nHamlin, 9. McPherson, _Hist. of the Rebellion_, p. 407.]\r\n\r\nRaymond's power and influence may be said to have climaxed in 1864 at\r\nthe Baltimore convention. He became chairman of the New York\r\ndelegation, chairman of the committee on resolutions, chairman of the\r\nNational Executive Committee, and the principal debater upon the\r\nfloor, manifesting a tact in the performance of his manifold duties\r\nthat surprised as much as it charmed. But the reason for his ardent\r\nsupport of Johnson will probably never be certainly known. McClure\r\ndeclared that he acted in accord with the wishes of Lincoln, who\r\ndiscreetly favoured and earnestly desired Johnson's nomination. This\r\nview was approved by George Jones, the proprietor of the _Times_ and\r\nRaymond's most intimate friend.[961] On the other hand, Nicolay\r\ndeclared that \"it was with minds absolutely untrammelled by even any\r\nknowledge of the President's wishes that the convention went about its\r\nwork of selecting his associate on the ticket.\"[962] In his long and\r\nbitter controversy with Nicolay, however, McClure furnished testimony\r\nindicating that Lincoln whispered his choice and that Raymond\r\nunderstood it.[963]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 961: Alex. K. McClure, _Lincoln and Men of War Times_, p.\r\n444.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 962: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 9, pp. 72-73.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 963: Alex. K. McClure, _Lincoln and Men of War Times_, pp.\r\n425-449.]\r\n\r\nWhile Raymond antagonised the radical supporters of Dickinson,\r\npatronage questions were again threatening trouble for the President.\r\nSerious friction had followed the appointment of a General Appraiser\r\nat New York, and when John J. Cisco, the assistant United States\r\ntreasurer, tendered his resignation to take effect June 30 (1864), the\r\nPresident desired to appoint one unobjectionable to Senator Morgan;\r\nbut Secretary Chase, regardless of the preferences of others, insisted\r\nupon Maunsell B. Field, then an assistant secretary of the treasury.\r\nMorgan vigorously protested, regarding him incompetent to fill such a\r\nplace. Besides, the designation of Field, who had no political backing\r\nin New York, would, he said, offend the conservative wing of the\r\nparty, which had been entirely ignored in the past. As a compromise\r\nthe Senator begged the President to select Richard M. Blatchford,\r\nDudley S. Gregory, or Thomas Hillhouse, whom he regarded as three of\r\nthe most eminent citizens of New York.\r\n\r\nLincoln, in a note to the Secretary, submitted these names. \"It will\r\nreally oblige me,\" he wrote, \"if you will make choice among these\r\nthree, or any other men that Senators Morgan and Harris will be\r\nsatisfied with.\"[964] This brief letter was followed on the same day\r\nby one presenting the annoyance to which patronage subjects a\r\nPresident. Happily civil service reform has removed much of this evil,\r\nbut enough remains to keep an Executive, if not members of Congress,\r\nin hot water. \"As the proverb goes,\" wrote Lincoln, \"no man knows so\r\nwell where the shoe pinches as he who wears it. I do not think Mr.\r\nField a very proper man for the place, but I would trust your judgment\r\nand forego this were the greater difficulty out of the way. Much as I\r\npersonally like Mr. Barney it has been a great burden to me to retain\r\nhim in his place when nearly all our friends in New York were directly\r\nor indirectly urging his removal. Then the appointment of Judge\r\nHogeboom to be general appraiser brought me to the verge of open\r\nrevolt. Now the appointment of Mr. Field would precipitate me in it,\r\nunless Senator Morgan and those feeling as he does could be brought to\r\nconcur in it. Strained as I already am at this point, I do not think I\r\ncan make this appointment in the direction of still greater\r\nstrain.\"[965]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 964: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 9, p. 93.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 965: _Ibid._, pp. 93-94.]\r\n\r\nChase had relieved the tension temporarily by inducing Cisco to\r\nwithdraw his resignation, but after getting the President's second\r\nletter, cleverly intimating that Field's appointment might necessitate\r\nthe removal of Barney, the Secretary promptly tendered his\r\nresignation. If the President was surprised, the Secretary, after\r\nreading Lincoln's reply, was not less so. \"Your resignation of the\r\noffice of secretary of the treasury, sent me yesterday, is accepted,\"\r\nsaid the brief note. \"Of all I have said in commendation of your\r\nability and fidelity I have nothing to unsay, and yet you and I have\r\nreached a point of mutual embarrassment in our official relation which\r\nit seems cannot be overcome or longer sustained consistently with the\r\npublic service.\"[966] Secretary Blaine's hasty resignation in 1892,\r\nand President Harrison's quick acceptance of it, were not more\r\ndramatic, except that Blaine's was tendered on the eve of a national\r\nnominating convention. It is more than doubtful if Chase intended to\r\nresign. He meant it to be as in previous years the beginning of a\r\ncorrespondence, expecting to receive from the President a soothing\r\nletter with concessions. But Lincoln's stock of patience, if not of\r\nsedatives, was exhausted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 966: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 9, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, after William Pitt Fessenden's appointment to\r\nsucceed Chase, Simeon Draper became collector of customs. He was one\r\nof Weed's oldest friends and in 1858 had been his first choice for\r\ngovernor.[967] But just now Abraham Wakeman was his first choice for\r\ncollector. Possibly in selecting Draper instead of Wakeman, Lincoln\r\nremembered Weed's failure to secure a legislative endorsement of his\r\nrenomination, a work specially assigned to him. At all events the\r\nanti-Weed faction accepted Draper as a decided triumph.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 967: \"Simeon Draper was impulsive and demonstrative. With\r\nthe advantages of a fine person, good conversational powers, and ready\r\nwit, his genial presence and cheerful voice imparted life and spirit\r\nto the numerous social circles in which he was ever a welcome guest.\"\r\n_Weed's Reminiscences_, T.W. Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2,\r\np. 483.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSEYMOUR'S PRESIDENTIAL FEVER\r\n\r\n1864\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I shall not attempt to retract or modify the Emancipation\r\nProclamation,\" said the President at the opening of Congress in\r\nDecember, 1863; \"nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free\r\nby the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.\"\r\nBut in submitting a plan for the restoration of the Confederate States\r\nhe offered amnesty, with rights of property except as to slaves, to\r\nall persons[968] who agreed to obey the Constitution, the laws, and\r\nthe Executive proclamations, and proposed that whenever such persons\r\nnumbered one-tenth of the qualified voters of a State they \"shall be\r\nrecognized as the true government of such State.\"[969] A week later\r\nthe Thirteenth Amendment, forever abolishing slavery, was introduced\r\ninto Congress. Thus the purpose of the radical Republicans became\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 968: Except certain ones specifically exempted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 969: Lincoln, _Complete Works_, Vol. 2, p. 443.]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1864, Governor Seymour, then the acknowledged head of his\r\nparty, made his message to the Legislature a manifesto to the\r\nDemocrats of the country. With measured rhetoric he traced the\r\nusurpations of the President and the acknowledged policy that was in\r\nfuture to guide the Administration. He courageously admitted that a\r\nmajority of the people and both branches of Congress sustained the\r\npolicy of the President, but such a policy, he declared, subordinating\r\nthe laws, the courts, and the people themselves to military power,\r\ndestroyed the rights of States and abrogated cherished principles of\r\ngovernment. The past, however, with its enormous debt, its\r\ndepreciated currency, its suspension of the writ of _habeas corpus_,\r\nand its abolition of free speech and a free press, did not mean such\r\nirretrievable ruin as the national bankruptcy which now threatened to\r\noverwhelm the nation. \"The problem with which we have to grapple is,\"\r\nhe said, \"how can we bring this war to a conclusion before such\r\ndisasters overwhelm us.\" Two antagonistic theories, he continued, are\r\nnow before us--one, consecrating the energies of war and the policy of\r\ngovernment to the restoration of the Union as it was and the\r\nConstitution as it is; the other, preventing by the creation of a new\r\npolitical system the return of the revolted States, though willing to\r\nlay down their arms. This alternative will enable an administration to\r\nperpetuate its power. It is a doctrine of national bankruptcy and\r\nnational ruin; it is a measure for continued military despotism over\r\none-third of our country, which will be the basis for military\r\ndespotism over the whole land.\r\n\r\nEvery measure to convert the war against armed rebellion into one\r\nagainst private property and personal rights at the South, he\r\ncontinued, has been accompanied by claims to exercise military power\r\nin the North. The proclamation of emancipation at the South, and the\r\nsuspension of the writ of _habeas corpus_ at the North; the\r\nconfiscation of private property in the seceding States, and the\r\narbitrary arrests, imprisonment, and banishment of the citizens of\r\nloyal States; the claim to destroy political organization at the\r\nSouth, and the armed interference by Government in local elections at\r\nthe North, have been contemporaneous events. We now find that as the\r\nstrength of rebellion is broken, new claims to arbitrary power are put\r\nforth. More prerogatives are asserted in the hour of triumph than were\r\nclaimed in days of disaster. The war is not to be brought to an end by\r\nthe submission of States to the Constitution and their return to the\r\nUnion, but to be prolonged until the South is subjugated and accepts\r\nsuch terms as may be dictated. This theory designs a sweeping\r\nrevolution and the creation of a new political system. There is but\r\none course, he concluded, which will now save us from such national\r\nruin--we must use every influence of wise statesmanship to bring back\r\nthe States which now reject their constitutional obligations. The\r\ntriumphs won by the soldiers in the field should be followed up by the\r\npeacemaking policy of the statesmen in the Cabinet. In no other way\r\ncan we save our Union.[970]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 970: _Public Record of Horatio Seymour_, pp. 198-212.]\r\n\r\nSeymour's claims and portents were in amazing contrast to his proposed\r\nmeasures of safety. Nevertheless he did his work well. It was his\r\nintention clearly to develop the ultimate tendencies of the war, and,\r\nin a paper of great power and interest, without invective or acerbity,\r\nhe did not hesitate to alarm the people respecting the jeopardy of\r\ntheir own liberties. Indeed, his message had the twofold purpose of\r\ndrawing the line distinctly between Administration and anti-Administration\r\nforces, and of concentrating public attention upon himself as a\r\nsuitable candidate for President.[971] Seymour was never without\r\nambition, for he loved politics and public affairs, and the Presidency\r\ncaptivated him. With deepest interest he watched the play at\r\nCharleston and at Baltimore in 1860, and had the nomination come to\r\nhim, Lincoln's election, depending as it did upon New York, must have\r\ngiven Republicans increased solicitude. Developments during the war\r\nhad stimulated this ambition. The cost of blood and treasure, blended\r\nwith arbitrary measures deemed necessary by the Government, pained and\r\nfinally exasperated him until he longed to possess the power of an\r\nExecutive to make peace. He believed that a compromise, presented in a\r\nspirit of patriotic clemency, with slavery undisturbed, would quickly\r\nterminate hostilities, and although he made the mistake of surrounding\r\nhimself with men whose influence sometimes betrayed him into weak and\r\nextreme positions, his ability to present his views in a scholarly and\r\npatriotic manner, backed by a graceful and gracious bearing, kept him\r\nin close touch with a party that resented methods which made peace\r\ndependent upon the abolition of slavery. He never provoked the\r\ncriticism of those whom he led, nor indulged in levity and flippancy.\r\nBut he was unsparing in his lectures to the Administration,\r\nadmonishing it to adopt the principles of government which prevailed\r\nwhen happiness and peace characterised the country's condition, and\r\nprophesying the ruin of the Union unless it took his advice. While,\r\ntherefore, his eulogy of the flag, the soldiers, the Union, and the\r\nsacrifices of the people won him reputation for patriotic\r\nconservatism, his condemnation of the Government brought him credit\r\nfor supporting and promoting all manner of disturbing factions and\r\nrevolutionary movements.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 971: Horace Greeley, _History of the Rebellion_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n667.]\r\n\r\nThe Regency understood the Governor's ambition, and the Democratic\r\nState convention, assembling at Albany on February 24 to designate\r\ndelegates to Chicago, opened the way for him as widely as possible. It\r\npromulgated no issues; it mentioned no candidate; it refused to accept\r\nFernando Wood and his brother as delegates because of their pronounced\r\nadvocacy of a dishonourable peace; and it placed Seymour at the head\r\nof a strong delegation, backed by Dean Richmond and August Belmont,\r\nand controlled by the unit rule. It was a remarkable coincidence, too,\r\nthat the New York _Herald_, which had pursued the Governor for more\r\nthan a year with bitter criticism, suddenly lapsed into silence.\r\nIndeed, the only shadow falling upon his pathway in the Empire State\r\nreflected the temporary anger of Tammany, which seceded from the\r\nconvention because the McKeon delegation, an insignificant coterie of\r\nadvocates of peace-on-any-conditions, had been admitted on terms of\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nAs the summer advanced political conditions seemed to favour Seymour.\r\nDuring the gloomy days of July and August the people prayed for a\r\ncessation of hostilities. \"The mercantile classes are longing for\r\npeace,\" wrote James Russell Lowell,[972] and Horace Greeley, in a\r\nletter of perfervid vehemence, pictured to the President the unhappy\r\ncondition. \"Our bleeding, bankrupt, almost dying country,\" he said,\r\n\"longs for peace, shudders at the prospect of fresh conscriptions, or\r\nfurther wholesale devastations, and of new rivers of human\r\nblood.\"[973] The President, also yearning for peace and willing to\r\naccept almost any proposition if it included the abolition of slavery,\r\nwaited for a communication from some agent of the Confederacy\r\nauthorised to treat with him; but such an one had not appeared,\r\nalthough several persons, safely sheltered in Canada, claimed\r\nauthority. One of these, calling himself William C. Jewett of\r\nColorado, finally convinced Horace Greeley that Clement C. Clay of\r\nAlabama and Jacob Thompson of Mississippi, two ambassadors of\r\nJefferson Davis, were ready at Niagara Falls to meet the President\r\nwhenever protection was afforded them. Upon being informed by Greeley\r\nof their presence, Lincoln replied (July 9): \"If you can find any\r\nperson, anywhere, professing to have any proposition of Jefferson\r\nDavis in writing for peace, embracing the restoration of the Union and\r\nabandonment of slavery, whatever else it embraces, say to him he may\r\ncome to me with you.\"[974]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 972: Motley's _Letters_, Vol. 2, p. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 973: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 9, p. 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 974: _Ibid._, pp. 187-188.]\r\n\r\nWhile Greeley, hesitating to undertake the mission himself, indulged\r\nin further correspondence with the President, James P. Jaquess, a\r\nMethodist clergyman and colonel of an Illinois regiment, with the\r\nknowledge of Lincoln, but without official authority except to pass\r\nthe Union lines, obtained (July 17) an audience with Jefferson Davis,\r\nto whom he made overtures of peace. In the interview Davis declared\r\nthat \"we are not fighting for slavery. We are fighting for\r\nindependence, and that or extermination we will have. We will be free.\r\nWe will govern ourselves. We will do it if we have to see every\r\nSouthern plantation sacked and every Southern city in flames.... Say\r\nto Mr. Lincoln from me that I shall at any time be pleased to receive\r\nproposals for peace on the basis of our independence. It will be\r\nuseless to approach me with any other.\"[975] It is known now that\r\nJaquess' report was substantially correct, but at the time the peace\r\nadvocate defiantly challenged its truth and the conservative was\r\nincredulous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 975: J.R. Gilmore (Kirke), _Down in Tennessee_, pp.\r\n272-280.]\r\n\r\nMeantime Greeley (July 16) proceeded to Niagara Falls. Thompson was\r\nnot there and Clay had no authority to act. When the famous editor\r\nasked fresh instructions Lincoln sent John Hay, his private secretary,\r\nwith the historic paper of July 18, which stopped further\r\nnegotiations.[976] In this well-meant effort the President desired to\r\nconvince his own party of the hopelessness of any satisfactory peace\r\nuntil the surrender of Lee's and Johnston's armies; but to the people,\r\ngrieved by the death of loved ones, or oppressed by constant anxiety,\r\nhis brief ultimatum seemed maladroit, while the men who favoured peace\r\nsimply on condition of the restoration of the Union, without the\r\nabolition of slavery, resented his course as arbitrary and needlessly\r\ncruel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 976: \"To whom it may concern: Any proposition which embraces\r\nthe restoration of peace, the integrity of the whole Union, and the\r\nabandonment of slavery, and which comes by and with an authority that\r\ncan control the armies now at war against the United States will be\r\nreceived and considered by the executive government of the United\r\nStates and will be met by liberal terms on other substantial and\r\ncollateral points, and the bearer or bearers thereof shall have safe\r\nconduct both ways. Abraham Lincoln.\"--Horace Greeley, _The American\r\nConflict_, Vol. 2, p. 665; Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1864, p. 780;\r\nNicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 9, p. 192.]\r\n\r\nLincoln's unpopularity touched bottom at this moment. The\r\ndissatisfaction found expression in a secret call for a second\r\nnational convention, to be held at Cincinnati on September 28, to\r\nnominate, if necessary, a new candidate for President.[977] This\r\nmovement, vigorously promoted in Ohio by Salmon P. Chase, received\r\ncordial support in New York City. George Opdyke directed it, Horace\r\nGreeley heartily endorsed it, Daniel S. Dickinson favoured it, and\r\nLucius Robinson and David Dudley Field sympathised with it.[978] Parke\r\nGodwin and William Curtis Noyes, if unwilling to go as far as Opdyke\r\nand Greeley, would have welcomed Lincoln's withdrawal.[979] Roscoe\r\nConkling, being advised of the scheme, promptly rejected it. \"I do not\r\napprove of the call or of the movement,\" he wrote, \"and cannot sign\r\nit.

It has doubtless reached him ere\r\nthis. At any rate nobody here doubts it, nor do I see anybody from\r\nother States who authorises the slightest hope of success. The people\r\nare wild for peace. They are told the President will only listen to\r\nterms of peace on condition that slavery be abandoned.\"[981] Weed's\r\n\"other channels\" meant a report from the Republican National Executive\r\nCommittee, which Raymond, then its chairman, submitted to Lincoln on\r\nAugust 22. \"The tide is setting strongly against us,\" he wrote. \"Hon.\r\nE.B. Washburn writes that 'were an election to be held now in Illinois\r\nwe should be beaten.' Mr. Cameron says that Pennsylvania is against\r\nus. Governor Morton writes that nothing but the most strenuous efforts\r\ncan carry Indiana. This State, according to the best information I can\r\nget, would go 50,000 against us to-morrow. And so of the rest. Two\r\nspecial causes are assigned for this great reaction in public\r\nsentiment--the want of military successes, and the impression in some\r\nminds, the fear and suspicion in others, that we are not to have peace\r\nin any event under this Administration until slavery is abandoned. In\r\nsome way or other the suspicion is widely diffused that we can have\r\npeace with Union if we would. It is idle to reason with this\r\nbelief--still more idle to denounce it. It can only be expelled by\r\nsome authoritative act at once bold enough to fix attention, and\r\ndistinct enough to defy incredulity and challenge respect.\"[982]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 981: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 9, p. 250.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 982: _Ibid._, p. 218.]\r\n\r\nIn December, 1860, in the presence of threatened war Lincoln refused\r\nto yield to a compromise that would extend slavery into free\r\nterritory; now, in the presence of failure at the polls, he insisted\r\nupon a peace that would abolish slavery. In 1860 he was flushed with\r\nvictory; in 1864 he was depressed by the absence of military\r\nachievement. But he did not weaken. He telegraphed Grant to \"hold on\r\nwith a bulldog grip, _and chew and choke as much as possible_,\"[983]\r\nand then, in the silence of early morning, with Raymond's starless\r\nletter on the table before him, he showed how coolly and magnanimously\r\na determined patriot could face political overthrow. \"This morning, as\r\nfor some days past,\" he wrote, \"it seems exceedingly probable that\r\nthis Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to\r\nso coöperate with the President-elect as to save the Union between the\r\nelection and the inauguration, as he will have secured his election on\r\nsuch ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards.\"[984]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 983: _Lincoln's Complete Works_, Vol. 2, p. 563.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 984: Nicolay-Hay, _Abraham Lincoln_, Vol. 9, p. 251.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of this popular discouragement exhibited itself in a\r\nmass peace convention, called by Fernando Wood and held at Syracuse on\r\nAugust 18. Its great attraction was Clement L. Vallandigham of Ohio,\r\nits platform favoured an armistice and a convention of States, and its\r\npurpose was the selection of a delegation to Chicago, which should\r\nadequately represent the peace faction of the State. The absence of\r\nmilitary achievement and the loud cries for peace, it was claimed, had\r\nchanged the conditions since the adjournment of the Democratic State\r\nconvention in February, and the necessity for a third party was\r\nconceded should the existing peace sentiment be ignored in the\r\nformulation of a platform and the selection of candidates at Chicago.\r\nAlthough the assembly indicated no preference for President, its known\r\npartiality for Seymour added to its strength. Through the manipulation\r\nof Richmond and the Regency, Wood failed to secure the appointment of\r\ndelegates, but he claimed, with much show of truth, that the meeting\r\nrepresented the sentiment of a great majority of the party. Wood had\r\nbecome intolerable to Dean Richmond and the conservative Democracy,\r\nwhose withering opposition to his candidacy for the United States\r\nSenate in the preceding February had made him ridiculous; but he could\r\nnot be muzzled, and although his influence rarely disturbed the party\r\nin the up-State counties, he was destined to continue in Congress the\r\nrest of his life, which ended in 1881.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic national convention had been called for July 4, but the\r\npopular depression, promising greater advantage later in the summer,\r\nled to its postponement until August 29. Thus it convened when gloom\r\nand despondency filled the land, making Horatio Seymour's journey to\r\nChicago an ovation. At every stop, especially at Detroit, crowds,\r\ncheers, speeches, and salvos of firearms greeted him. The convention\r\ncity recognised him as its most distinguished visitor, and the\r\nopponents of a war policy, voicing the party's sentiment for peace,\r\npublicly proclaimed him their favourite.\r\n\r\nBefore Seymour left Albany the _Argus_ announced that he would not be\r\na candidate;[985] but now, flattered by attention, and encouraged by\r\nthe peace-faction's strategic movement, he declined to indicate his\r\nposition. Political conditions had made a profound impression upon\r\nhim. Moreover, deep in his heart Seymour did not fancy McClellan. His\r\npublic life had been brief, and his accomplishment little either as a\r\nsoldier or civilian. Besides, his arrest of the Maryland Legislature,\r\nand his indifference to the sacredness of the writ of _habeas corpus_,\r\nclassing him among those whom the Governor had bitterly denounced,\r\ntended to destroy the latter's strongest argument against the Lincoln\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 985: \"The announcement in the Albany _Argus_ that Governor\r\nSeymour was not a candidate was written by Seymour himself, and taken\r\nto the _Argus_ by his private secretary. It is now announced that it\r\nwas intended as a feeler. The whole force of the opposition to\r\nMcClellan is centred in this move for Seymour.\"--New York _Herald_\r\n(Chicago despatch), August 28, 1864.]\r\n\r\nDean Richmond, now a vigorous supporter of McClellan, could not be\r\nconfused as to the General's strength or the Governor's weakness, and\r\nhe attempted at an early hour to silence the appeal for Seymour by\r\nsolidifying the New York delegation for McClellan; but in these\r\nefforts he found it difficult to subdue the personal independence and\r\noutspoken ways of the Governor, whose opposition to McClellan was more\r\nthan a passing cloud-shadow.[986] This delayed matters. So long as a\r\nray of hope existed for the favourite son, the New York delegation\r\ndeclined to be forced into an attitude of opposition. Indeed, the day\r\nbefore the convention opened, it refused, by a vote of 38 to 23, to\r\nascertain its choice for President. When, at last, it became\r\ndefinitely known that McClellan had a majority of each State\r\ndelegation, practically assuring his nomination under the two-thirds\r\nrule on the first ballot, Seymour put an end to the talk of his\r\ncandidacy. Nevertheless, his vote, dividing the New York delegation,\r\nwas cast for Samuel Nelson, the distinguished jurist who had succeeded\r\nSmith Thompson as an associate justice of the United States Supreme\r\nCourt. Other anti-McClellan New York delegates preferred Charles\r\nO'Conor and James Guthrie of Kentucky. Subsequently, in explaining his\r\naction, Seymour disclaimed any doubt of the ability or patriotism of\r\nthe late commander of the Army of the Potomac.[987]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 986: \"Dean Richmond remains firm for McClellan, and has cut\r\nloose from the Regency. He is at the present moment closeted with\r\nSeymour, trying to convince him of the fallacy of the move.\"--New York\r\n_Herald_ (Chicago despatch), August 28, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 987: _Ibid._, September 1, 1864.]\r\n\r\nThe New York delegation had as usual a strong if not a controlling\r\ninfluence in the convention. Dean Richmond who led it at Charleston\r\nand Baltimore again guided its counsels, while the presence of John\r\nGanson and Albert P. Laning of Buffalo, and Francis Kernan of Utica,\r\nadded to its forcefulness upon the floor. Next to Seymour, however,\r\nits most potent member for intellectual combat was Samuel J. Tilden,\r\nwho served upon the committee on resolutions. Tilden, then fifty years\r\nold, was without any special charm of person or grace of manner. He\r\nlooked like an invalid. His voice was feeble, his speech neither\r\nfluent nor eloquent, and sometimes he gave the impression of\r\nindecision. But his logic was irresistible, his statements\r\nexhaustive, and his ability as a negotiator marvellous and unequalled.\r\nHe was the strong man of the committee, and his presence came very\r\nnear making New York the dominant factor in the convention.\r\n\r\nTilden's sympathies leaned toward the South. He resented the formation\r\nof the Republican party,[988] maintained that a State could repel\r\ncoercion as a nation might repel invasion,[989] declared at the\r\nTweddle Hall meeting in January, 1861, that he \"would resist the use\r\nof force to coerce the South into the Union,\"[990] and declined to\r\nsign the call for the patriotic uprising of the people in Union Square\r\non April 20.[991] On the other hand, he addressed departing regiments,\r\ngave money, and in 1862 wrote: \"Within the Union we will give you [the\r\nSouth] the Constitution you profess to revere, renewed with fresh\r\nguarantees of equal rights and equal safety. We will give you\r\neverything that local self-government demands; everything that a\r\ncommon ancestory of glory--everything that national fraternity or\r\nChristian fellowship requires; but to dissolve the federal bond\r\nbetween these States, to dismember our country, whoever else consents,\r\nwe will not. No; never, never never!\"[992] Yet in February, 1863, in\r\nopposition to the Loyal Publication Society, he assisted in organising\r\na local society which published and distributed \"Copperhead\"\r\nliterature.[993] He had not, however, been active in politics since\r\nhis defeat for attorney-general in 1855. It was during these years\r\nthat he began the accumulation of his large fortune. He acquired\r\neasily. He seemed to know intuitively when to buy and when to sell,\r\nand he profited by the rare opportunities offered during the great\r\ndepreciation in government bonds. Later, he dealt in railroads, his\r\nprivate gains being so enormous that men thought his ambition for\r\nwealth unscrupulously selfish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 988: Statement to Preston King in 1854. _Harper's Weekly_,\r\nSeptember 16, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 989: Letter to William Kent in October, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 990: Horace Greeley, _The American Conflict_, Vol. 1, pp.\r\n388-394.

He\r\nalso defeated a measure introduced by Washington Hunt suggesting an\r\narmistice and a convention of States, and supported a positive\r\ndeclaration that he thought sufficient to hold the war vote. However,\r\nthe dread of a split, such as had occurred at Charleston and Baltimore\r\nin 1860, possessed the committee, and in the confusion of the last\r\nmoment, by a slight majority, the pivotal declaration pronouncing the\r\nwar a failure was accepted.[994]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 994: \"Never did men work harder than Messrs. Guthrie of\r\nKentucky and Tilden of New York. All they asked finally was that the\r\nplatform should not be so strong for peace that it would drive the war\r\nvote from them.\"--New York _Herald_, September 5, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"Vallandigham wrote the second, the material resolution, of the\r\nChicago platform, and carried it through the sub-committee and the\r\ngeneral committee, in spite of the most desperate and persistent\r\nopposition on the part of Tilden and his friends, Mr. Cassidy himself\r\nin an adjoining room labouring to defeat it.\"--New York _News_,\r\nOctober 22, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"The platform which declared the war a failure was jointly concocted\r\nby Seymour and Vallandigham.\"--New York _Tribune_, November 5, 1868.]\r\n\r\nSeymour's election as permanent chairman of the convention gave him\r\nabundant opportunity to proclaim his abhorrence of the Administration.\r\nHis speech, prepared with unusual care, showed the measured dignity\r\nand restraint of a trained orator, who knew how to please a popular\r\naudience with a glowing denunciation of principles it detested. Every\r\nappeal was vivid and dramatic; every allusion told. Throughout the\r\nwhole ran the thread of one distinct proposition,--that the Republican\r\nparty had sinned away its day of grace, and that the patriotic work\r\nof the Democratic party must begin at once if the Union was to be\r\nsaved. To Seymour it was not a new proposition. He had stated it in\r\nthe last campaign and reiterated it in his latest message; but never\r\nbefore did he impress it by such striking sentences as now fell upon\r\nthe ears of a delighted convention. \"Even now, when war has desolated\r\nour land,\" he said, \"has laid its heavy burdens upon labor, when\r\nbankruptcy and ruin overhang us, this Administration will not have\r\nUnion except upon conditions unknown to our Constitution; it will not\r\nallow the shedding of blood to cease, even for a little time, to see\r\nif Christian charity or the wisdom of statesmanship may not work out a\r\nmethod to save our country. Nay, more than this, it will not listen to\r\na proposal for peace which does not offer that which this government\r\nhas no right to ask. This Administration cannot now save this Union,\r\nif it would. It has, by its proclamations, by vindictive legislation,\r\nby displays of hate and passion, placed obstacles in its own pathway\r\nwhich it cannot overcome, and has hampered its own freedom of action\r\nby unconstitutional acts. The bigotry of fanatics and the intrigues of\r\nplacemen have made the bloody pages of the history of the past three\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to be impressed by such an impassioned lament.\r\nThere was also much in Seymour himself as well as in his words to\r\nattract the attention of the convention.[995] Added years gave him a\r\nmore stately, almost a picturesque bearing, while a strikingly\r\nintelligent face changed its expression with the ease and swiftness of\r\nan actor's. This was never more apparent than now, when he turned,\r\nabruptly, from the alleged sins of Republicans to the alleged virtues\r\nof Democrats. Relaxing its severity, his countenance wore a\r\ntriumphant smile as he declared in a higher and more resonant key,\r\nthat \"if this Administration cannot save the Union, _we can_! Mr.\r\nLincoln values many things above the Union; we put it first of all. He\r\nthinks a proclamation worth more than peace; we think the blood of our\r\npeople more precious than the edicts of the President. There are no\r\nhindrances in our pathway to Union and to peace. We demand no\r\nconditions for the restoration of our Union; we are shackled with no\r\nhates, no prejudices, no passions. We wish for fraternal relationships\r\nwith the people of the South. We demand for them what we demand for\r\nourselves--the full recognition of the rights of States. We mean that\r\nevery star on our Nation's banner shall shine with an equal\r\nlustre.\"[996] As the speaker concluded, the audience, with deafening\r\napplause, testified its approval of these sentiments. Yet one wonders\r\nthat he could end without saying a word, at least, in condemnation of\r\nthe Secessionists, whose appeal from the ballot to the bullet had\r\ninaugurated \"the bloody pages of the history of the past three years.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 995: \"Governor Seymour was an elegant and accomplished\r\ngentleman with a high-bred manner which never unbent, and he was\r\nalways faultlessly dressed. He looked the ideal of an aristocrat, and\r\nyet he was and continued to be until his death the idol of the\r\nDemocracy.\"--_Speeches of Chauncey M. Depew_, November, 1896, to\r\nApril, 1902, p. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 996: Horatio Seymour's _Public Record_, pp. 230-232.]\r\n\r\nThe platform, adopted without debate, reaffirmed devotion to the\r\nUnion, expressed sympathy with soldiers and prisoners of war,\r\ndenounced interference in military elections, and stigmatised alleged\r\nillegal and arbitrary acts of the government. The second resolution,\r\nprepared by Vallandigham, declared that \"this convention does\r\nexplicitly resolve as the sense of the American people, that after\r\nfour years of failure to restore the Union by the experiment of war,\r\njustice, humanity, liberty, and the public welfare demand that\r\nimmediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, with a view\r\nto an ultimate convention of the States, or other peaceable means, to\r\nthe end that the earliest practicable moment peace may be restored on\r\nthe basis of the Federal Union of the States.\"[997]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 997: Edward McPherson, _History of the Rebellion_, p. 419;\r\nAppleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1864, p. 793.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to excuse Tilden's silence when this fatal resolution\r\nwas adopted. In the final haste to report the platform, the deep\r\nsignificance of Vallandigham's words may not have been fully\r\nappreciated by the Committee;[998] but Tilden understood their\r\nmeaning, and vigorous opposition might have avoided them.[999] He\r\nseems, however, to have shared the fear of McClellan's friends that\r\nthe defeat of the resolution would endanger the integrity of the\r\nconvention, and to have indulged the hope that McClellan's letter of\r\nacceptance would prove an antidote to the Ohioan's peace-poison. But\r\nhis inaction did little credit either to his discernment or judgment,\r\nfor the first ballot for President disclosed the groundlessness of his\r\ntimidity,[1000] and the first work of the campaign revealed the\r\ninefficiency of the candidate's statements.[1001] Indeed, so grievous\r\nwas Tilden's mistake that his distinguished biographer (Bigelow)\r\navoided his responsibility for declaring the war a failure by\r\nignoring his presence at Chicago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 998: \"McClellan's supporters are not scared by any paper\r\npellets of the brain, wise or otherwise, which ever came from the\r\nmidnight sessions of a resolution committee in the hurly-burly of a\r\nnational convention.\"--Speech of Robert C.

McClellan is not large enough to\r\ncover out of sight the bad points in the Chicago platform.\"--New York\r\n_Herald_, September 6, 1864.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the cheers for McClellan that greeted the returning\r\ndelegates were mingled with those of the country over Sherman's\r\ncapture of Atlanta and Farragut's destruction of the Mobile forts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFENTON DEFEATS SEYMOUR\r\n\r\n1864\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brilliant victories of Sherman and Farragut had an appreciable\r\neffect upon Republicans. It brought strong hope of political success,\r\nand made delegates to the Syracuse convention (September 7) very\r\nplucky. Weed sought to control, but the Radicals, in the words of\r\nBurke's famous sentence, were lords of the ascendant. They proposed to\r\nnominate Reuben E. Fenton, and although the Chautauquan's popularity\r\nand freedom from the prejudices of Albany politics commended him to\r\nthe better judgment of all Republicans, the followers of Greeley\r\nrefused to consult the Conservatives respecting him or any part of the\r\nticket. Resenting such treatment Weed indicated an inclination to\r\nsecede, and except that his regard for Fenton steadied him the\r\nhistoric bolt of the Silver Grays might have been repeated.[1002]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1002: New York _Herald_, September 8.]\r\n\r\nFenton was a well-to-do business man, without oratorical gifts or\r\nstatesmanlike qualities, but with a surpassing genius for public life.\r\nHe quickly discerned the drift of public sentiment and had seldom made\r\na glaring mistake. He knew, also, how to enlist other men in his\r\nservice and attach them to his fortunes. During his ten years in\r\nCongress he developed a faculty for organisation, being able to\r\ncoördinate all his resources and to bring them into their place in the\r\naccomplishment of his purposes. This was conspicuously illustrated in\r\nthe Thirty-seventh Congress when he formed a combination that made\r\nGalusha A. Grow speaker of the House. Besides, by careful attention to\r\nthe wants of constituents and to the work of the House, backed by the\r\nshrewdness of a typical politician who rarely makes an enemy, he was\r\nrecognised as a sagacious counsellor and safe leader. He had\r\npreviously been mentioned for governor, and in the preceding winter\r\nTheodore M. Pomeroy, then representing the Auburn district in\r\nCongress, presented him for speaker.[1003] Schuyler Colfax controlled\r\nthe caucus, but the compliment expressed the esteem of Fenton's\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1003: New York _Tribune_, December 7, 1863.]\r\n\r\nHe was singularly striking and attractive in person, tall, erect, and\r\ngraceful in figure, with regular features and wavy hair slightly\r\ntinged with gray. His sloping forehead, full at the eyebrows,\r\nindicated keen perceptive powers. He was suave in address, so suave,\r\nindeed, that his enemies often charged him with insincerity and even\r\nduplicity, but his gracious manner, exhibited to the plainest woman\r\nand most trifling man, won the hearts of the people as quickly as his\r\npolitical favours recruited the large and devoted following that\r\nremained steadfast to the end. Perhaps no one in his party presented a\r\nstronger running record. He belonged to the Barnburners, he presided\r\nat the birth of the Republican party, he stood for a vigorous\r\nprosecution of the war regardless of the fate of slavery, and he had\r\navoided the Weed-Greeley quarrels. If he was not a statesman, he at\r\nleast possessed the needed qualities to head the State ticket.\r\n\r\nAs usual John A. Dix's name came before the convention. It was well\r\nknown that party nomenclature did not represent his views, but his\r\nadmirers, profoundly impressed with his sterling integrity and weight\r\nof character, insisted, amidst the loudest cheering of the day, that\r\nhis name be presented. Nevertheless, an informal ballot quickly\r\ndisclosed that Fenton was the choice, and on motion of Elbridge G.\r\nLapham the nomination became unanimous.[1004] Other nominations fell\r\nto the Radicals.[1005] Not until Greeley was about to capture first\r\nplace as a presidential elector-at-large, however, did the\r\nConservatives fully realise how badly they were being punished. Then\r\nevery expedient known to diplomacy was exhausted. Afternoon shaded\r\ninto evening and evening into night. Still the contest continued. It\r\nseems never to have occurred to the Weed faction that Horace Greeley,\r\nwhom it had so often defeated, could be given an office, even though\r\nits duties covered but a single day, and in its desperation it\r\ndiscovered a willingness to compromise on any other name. But\r\nGreeley's friends forced the fight, and to their great joy won a most\r\ndecisive victory.[1006]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1004: \"The informal vote was as follows: Fenton, 247-1/2;\r\nTremaine, 69; Dix, 35-1/2.\"--New York _Herald_, September 8, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1005: \"The ticket is as follows: Governor, Reuben E.

Forrest of Schenectady.\"--New York _Tribune_,\r\nSeptember 14, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1006: \"The following is the vote for presidential\r\nelector-at-large: Horace Greeley, 215; Preston King, 191-1/2; Daniel\r\nS.

Stranahan, 27; Thurlow Weed, 1.\"--_Ibid._,\r\nSeptember 8.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Weed men were nursing their resentment because of the honour\r\nthus suddenly thrust upon the most famous American editor,[1007] a\r\ngreat surprise convulsed the Democratic State convention.[1008] The\r\nreport that Horatio Seymour sought release from official labours\r\nbecause of ill health and the demands of private business, created the\r\nbelief that he would decline a renomination even if tendered by\r\nacclamation. Indeed, the Governor himself, in conversation with Dean\r\nRichmond, reiterated his oft-expressed determination not to accept.\r\nThe Regency, believing him sincere, agreed upon William F. Allen of\r\nOswego, although other candidates, notably William Kelly of Dutchess,\r\nthe nominee of the Softs in 1860, and Amasa J. Parker of Albany, were\r\nmentioned. Lucius Robinson, declining to be considered for second\r\nplace, urged the nomination of Dix for governor. Of these candidates\r\nSeymour was quoted as favourable to Parker. Still a feeling of unrest\r\ndisturbed the hotel lobbies. \"There is some talk,\" said the _Herald_,\r\n\"of giving Seymour a complimentary vote, with the understanding that\r\nhe will then decline, but this is opposed as a trick to place him in\r\nthe field again, although those who pretend to speak for him\r\npositively declare that he will not accept the nomination upon any\r\ncontingency.\"[1009] When told on convention morning that Seymour would\r\naccept if nominated by acclamation, Richmond ridiculed the idea. His\r\nincredulity was strengthened by the statement of two Oneida delegates,\r\nwhom the Governor, only a few moments before, had instructed to\r\nwithdraw his name if presented. Thus matters stood until the\r\nconvention, having enthusiastically applauded an indorsement of\r\nSeymour's administration, quickly and by acclamation carried a motion\r\nfor his renomination, the delegates jumping to their feet and giving\r\ncheer after cheer. Immediately a delegate, rising to a question of\r\nprivilege, stated that the Governor, in the hearing of gentlemen from\r\nhis own county, had positively declined to accept a nomination because\r\nhis health and the state of his private affairs forbade it. As this\r\ndid not satisfy the delegates, a committee, appointed to notify\r\nSeymour of his selection, reported that the Governor whose temporary\r\nillness prevented his attendance upon the convention, had had much to\r\nsay about private affairs, ill health, and excessive labour, but that\r\nsince the delegates insisted upon his renomination, he acquiesced in\r\ntheir choice.[1010]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1007: \"The nomination of Horace Greeley for elector-at-large\r\nis a bitter pill. The Weed men make no secret that Fenton's name is\r\nthe only thing that will save the ticket.\"--New York _Herald_,\r\nSeptember 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1008: Held at Albany on September 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1009: New York _Herald_, September 14, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1010: _Ibid._, September 16.]\r\n\r\nSeymour's action was variously interpreted. Some pronounced it tricky;\r\nothers, that he declined because he feared defeat.[1011] But there was\r\nno evidence of insincerity. He wanted the office less in 1864 than he\r\ndid in 1862. It had brought labour and anxiety, and no relief from\r\nincreasing solicitude was in sight if re-elected. But his friends,\r\nresenting the New York delegation's action in withholding from him its\r\nsupport for President, determined to be avenged by renominating him\r\nfor governor. They knew that Dean Richmond, whose admiration for the\r\nGovernor had not been increased by the latter's performance at\r\nChicago, wanted a candidate of more pronounced views respecting a\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war, and that in his support of Allen he\r\nhad the convention well in hand. Wisely distrusting the Regency,\r\ntherefore, they worked in secret, talking of the honour and prestige\r\nof a complimentary vote, but always declaring, what Seymour himself\r\nemphasised, that the Governor would not again accept the office. Not a\r\nmisstep left its print in the proceedings. Before the chairman put the\r\nmotion for his renomination, a delegate from Oneida, rising to\r\nwithdraw the name, was quieted by the assurance that it was only\r\ncomplimentary. An Albany lieutenant of Dean Richmond, obtaining the\r\nfloor with the help of a stentorian voice, began to block the\r\nmovement, but quickly subsided after hearing the explanation from a\r\ndelegate at his side that it was only complimentary. When the motion\r\nhad carried, however, and the Oneida gentleman began fulfilling the\r\nGovernor's directions, came the cry, \"Too late, too late. We have\r\nnominated the candidate!\" So perfectly was the _coup d'état_ arranged\r\nthat the prime mover of the scheme was appointed chairman of the\r\ncommittee to wait upon the Governor. Afterwards people recalled, with\r\na disposition to connect Seymour with this master-stroke in politics,\r\nthat he had never declined by letter, and that the reasons given,\r\nlike the illness that kept him from facing the convention, were\r\nlargely imaginary. \"That crowd saw how beautifully they were done,\"\r\nsaid Depew, then secretary of state at Albany, \"while Dean Richmond's\r\nlanguage was never printed.\"[1012]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1011: \"Seymour tried to get the nomination at Chicago by the\r\nsame tricky means he has secured it at Albany,--by declaring\r\nbeforehand that he would not be a candidate. He failed at Chicago\r\nbecause of the overwhelming popularity of McClellan; he succeeded at\r\nAlbany by his friends seizing a moment to nominate him when the\r\nconvention was in a delirium of enthusiasm at his apparent\r\nself-sacrifice in persisting to decline.\"--New York _Herald_\r\n(editorial), September 17, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1012: From Chauncey M. Depew's speech, March 23,\r\n1901.--_Addresses of_, p. 105.\r\n\r\n\"The ticket nominated is as follows: Governor, Horatio Seymour of\r\nOneida; Lieutenant-Governor, David R.

Kelley of Dutchess and\r\nWashington Hunt of Niagara.\"--New York _Herald_, September 16, 1864.]\r\n\r\nScarcely had the convention adjourned before the brilliant\r\nachievements in the Shenandoah valley thrilled the North from Maine to\r\nCalifornia. On September 19, at the battle of Winchester, General\r\nSheridan defeated General Early, and on the 22d, at Fisher's Hill, put\r\nhim to flight. \"Only darkness,\" Sheridan telegraphed Grant, \"has saved\r\nthe whole of Early's army from total destruction. I do not think there\r\never was an army so badly routed.\"[1013] These victories, recalling\r\nthose of Stonewall Jackson in 1862, appealed to the popular\r\nimagination and quickly reassured the country. Besides, on September\r\n21, the withdrawal of Fremont and Cochrane, the Cleveland candidates,\r\nunited Radical and Conservative in a vigorous campaign for Lincoln. A\r\nprivate letter from Grant, who participated in the glory accorded\r\nSherman and Sheridan, told the true condition of the Confederacy. \"The\r\nrebels,\" he said, \"have now in their ranks their last man. They have\r\nrobbed the cradle and the grave equally to get their present force.\r\nBesides what they lose in frequent skirmishes and battles, they are\r\nnow losing, from desertions and other causes, at least one regiment\r\nper day. With this drain upon them the end is not far distant, if we\r\nonly be true to ourselves.\"[1014]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1013: Official Records, Vol. 43, Part 1, p. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1014: New York _Times_, September 9, 1864; Appleton's\r\n_Cyclopædia_, 1864, p. 134.]\r\n\r\nThis story, coupled with recent victories, turned the Democratic\r\nplatform into a lie. Instead of being a failure, the war was now\r\nrecognised as a grand success, and radical speakers, replying to the\r\nclamour for a cessation of hostilities, maintained that the abolition\r\nof slavery was the only condition that promised a permanent peace.\r\nBrilliant descriptions of Grant's work, aided by his distinguished\r\nlieutenants, were supplemented later in the campaign by the recital of\r\n\"Sheridan's Ride,\" which produced the wildest enthusiasm. Indeed, the\r\ninfluence of the army's achievements, dissipating the despondency of\r\nthe summer months, lifted the campaign into an atmosphere of\r\npatriotism not before experienced since the spring of 1861, and\r\nestablished the belief that Lincoln's re-election meant the end of\r\nsecession and slavery. \"There will be peace,\" said John Cochrane, \"but\r\nit will be the peace which the musket gives to a conquered host.\"[1015]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1015: New York _Tribune_, October 11, 1864.]\r\n\r\nReferring to the farewell speech of Alexander H. Stephens upon his\r\nretirement from public life in 1859, George William Curtis, with the\r\neloquence that adorned his addresses at that period, thrilled his\r\naudience with an exciting war picture: \"Listen to Mr. Stephens in the\r\nsummer sunshine six years ago. 'There is not now a spot of the public\r\nterritory of the United States over which the national flag floats\r\nwhere slavery is excluded by the law of Congress, and the highest\r\ntribunal of the land has decided that Congress has no power to make\r\nsuch a law. At this time there is not a ripple upon the surface. The\r\ncountry was never in a profounder quiet.' Do you comprehend the\r\nterrible significance of those words? He stops; he sits down. The\r\nsummer sun sets over the fields of Georgia. Good-night, Mr.\r\nStephens--a long good-night. Look out from your window--how calm it\r\nis! Upon Missionary Ridge, upon Lookout Mountain, upon the heights of\r\nDalton, upon the spires of Atlanta, silence and solitude; the peace of\r\nthe Southern policy of slavery and death. But look! Hark! Through the\r\ngreat five years before you a light is shining--a sound is ringing.\r\nIt is the gleam of Sherman's bayonets, it is the roar of Grant's guns,\r\nit is the red daybreak and wild morning music of peace indeed, the\r\npeace of national life and liberty.\"[1016]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1016: Edward Cary, _Life of G.W. Curtis_, pp. 186-187.]\r\n\r\nThe sulkers now came out of their tents. Daniel S. Dickinson, no\r\nlonger peddling his griefs in private ears, declared \"there was no\r\ndoubt of the President's triumphant election;\"[1017] the tone of Bryant\r\nand the _Evening Post_ changed; Beecher renewed hope through the\r\n_Independent_ and preached a political sermon every Sunday evening;\r\nWeed and Raymond discontinued their starless letters to Lincoln;\r\nGeorge Opdyke cancelled the call for a second national convention and\r\nanother candidate for President; and Horace Greeley, silent as to his\r\npart in the recent conspiracy, joined the army of Union orators.\r\nCatching again the spirit of the great moral impulse and that lofty\r\nenthusiasm which had aroused the people of the North to the decisive\r\nstruggle against slavery, these leaders sprang to the work of\r\nadvancing the cause of liberty and human rights.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1017: New York _Sun_, June 30, 1889.]\r\n\r\nThe Democrats sought to evade Vallandigham's words of despair, written\r\ninto the Chicago platform, by eulogising McClellan, but as the glory\r\nof Antietam paled in the presence of Sherman's and Sheridan's\r\nvictories, they declared that success in the field did not mean peace.\r\n\"Armed opposition is driven from the fields of Kentucky, Missouri,\r\nMaryland, and parts of Louisiana,\" said Horatio Seymour, \"and yet this\r\nportion of country, already conquered, requires more troops to hold it\r\nunder military rule than are demanded for our armies to fight the\r\nembattled forces of the Confederacy. You will find that more men will\r\nbe needed to keep the South in subjection to the arbitrary projects of\r\nthe Administration than are required to drive the armies of rebellion\r\nfrom the field. The peace you are promised is no peace, but is a\r\ncondition which will perpetuate and make enduring all the worst\r\nfeatures of this war.\"[1018]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1018: _Public Record of Horatio Seymour_, p. 254.]\r\n\r\nIn their eagerness Democratic speakers, encouraged by the New York\r\n_World_, then the ablest and most influential journal of its party,\r\nturned with bitterness, first upon Lincoln's administration, and\r\nfinally upon Lincoln himself. \"Is Mr. Lincoln honest?\" asked the\r\n_World_. \"That he has succumbed to the opportunities and temptations\r\nof his present place is capable of the easiest proof.\"[1019] This was\r\nsufficient for the stump orator and less influential journal to base\r\nangry and extravagant charges of wrong-doing, which became frequent\r\nand noisy.[1020] John Van Buren called Lincoln a \"twenty-second-rate\r\nman,\" and declared the country \"irretrievably gone\" if McClellan was\r\ndefeated.[1021] Seymour did not charge Lincoln with personal\r\ndishonesty, but he thought his administration had rendered itself a\r\npartner in fraud and corruption. \"I do not mean to say,\" he declared,\r\n\"that the Administration is to be condemned because, under\r\ncircumstances so unusual as those which have existed during this war,\r\nbad men have taken advantage of the confusion in affairs to do wrong.\r\nBut I do complain that when these wrongs are done, the Government\r\ndeliberately passes laws that protect the doer, and thus make\r\nwrong-doing its own act. Moreover, in an election like this, when the\r\nGovernment is spending such an enormous amount of money, and the\r\nliability to peculation is so great, the Administration that will say\r\nto contractors, as has been openly said in circulars, 'You have had a\r\ngood contract, out of which you have made money, and we expect you to\r\nuse a part of that money to assist to replace us in power,' renders\r\nitself a partner in fraud and corruption.\"[1022]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1019: New York _World_, September 22, 23, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1020: \"The _Journal of Commerce_ of yesterday indulges in a\r\ngeneral fling against the personal habits of the President and other\r\nmembers of his family.\"--New York _Herald_, October 11, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1021: _Ibid._, November 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1022: _Public Record of Horatio Seymour_, p. 257.]\r\n\r\nAfter Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana swung into line on October 10 no\r\ndoubt remained as to the general result. But Republican confidence in\r\nNew York was greatly shaken by the disclosure of a conspiracy to use\r\nthe soldier vote for fraudulent purposes. Under an amendment to the\r\nConstitution, ratified in March, 1864, soldiers in the field were\r\nallowed to vote, provided properly executed proxies were delivered to\r\nelection inspectors in their home districts within sixty days next\r\nprevious to the election, and to facilitate the transmission of such\r\nproxies agents for the State were appointed at Baltimore, Washington,\r\nand other points. Several of these agents, charged with forgery, were\r\narrested by the military authorities, one of whom confessed that\r\nenough forged proxies had been forwarded from Washington \"to fill a\r\ndry-goods box.\" Of these spurious ballots several hundred were seized,\r\nand two of the forgers committed to the penitentiary.[1023] \"We are\r\ninformed,\" said the _Tribune_, \"that Oswego county is flooded with\r\nspurious McClellan votes of every description. There are forged votes\r\nfrom living as well as from dead soldiers; fictitious votes from\r\nsoldiers whose genuine votes and powers of attorney are in the hands\r\nof their friends. These packages correspond with the work described in\r\nthe recent Baltimore investigation.\"[1024] Meantime Governor Seymour,\r\nuneasy lest the liberties of his agents be limited, directed Amasa J.\r\nParker, William F. Allen, and William Kelly to proceed to Washington\r\nand \"vindicate the laws of the State\" and \"expose all attempts to\r\nprevent soldiers from voting, or to detain or alter the votes already\r\ncast.\" These commissioners, after a hurried investigation, reported\r\nthat \"although there may have been irregularities, they have found no\r\nevidence that any frauds have been committed by any person connected\r\nwith the New York agency.\"[1025] Nevertheless, the sequel showed that\r\nthis plot, if not discovered, would probably have changed the result\r\nin the State.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1023: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1864, pp. 584-8; New York\r\n_Herald_, November 4 and 5; New York _Tribune_, October 27, 28, 29,\r\nNovember 2, 4. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1024: _Ibid._, November 5, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1025: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1864, pp. 584-588.]\r\n\r\nDuring the last month of the campaign the interest of the whole\r\ncountry centred in New York. Next to the election of Lincoln,\r\nRepublicans everywhere desired the defeat of Seymour. To them his\r\nspeech at Chicago had been a malignant indictment of the Government,\r\nand his one address in the campaign, while it did not impute personal\r\ndishonesty to the President, had branded his administration as a party\r\nto fraud. Lincoln regarded the contest in New York as somewhat\r\npersonal to himself, and from day to day sought information with the\r\nanxious persistency that characterised his inquiries during the\r\ncanvass in 1860. Fenton fully appreciated the importance of\r\nvindicating the President, and for the admirable thoroughness of the\r\ncampaign he received great credit.\r\n\r\nAfter the polls had closed on November 8 it soon became known that\r\nalthough the President had 179 electoral votes to 21 for McClellan,\r\nNew York was in grave doubt. On Wednesday approximated returns put\r\nRepublicans 1,400 ahead. Finally it developed that in a total vote of\r\n730,821, Lincoln had 6,749 more than McClellan, and Fenton 8,293 more\r\nthan Seymour. Fenton's vote exceeded Lincoln's by 1,544. \"We believe\r\nthis the only instance,\" said the _Tribune_, \"in which a Republican\r\ncandidate for governor polled a heavier vote than that cast for our\r\ncandidate for President at the same election.\"[1026] The Legislature\r\nwas largely Republican, and the twenty congressmen, a gain of five,\r\nincluded Roscoe Conkling and John A. Griswold, an intrepid, energetic\r\nspirit--the very incarnation of keen good sense. Like Erastus Corning,\r\nwhom he succeeded in Congress, Griswold was a business man, whose\r\nintelligent interest in public affairs made him mayor of Troy at the\r\nage of twenty-eight. In 1862 he carried his district as a Democrat by\r\nover 2,000 majority, but developing more political independence than\r\nfriend or foe had anticipated, he refused to follow his party in war\r\nlegislation, and with Moses F. Odell, a Democratic colleague from\r\nBrooklyn, boldly supported the Thirteenth Amendment. This made him a\r\nRepublican.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1026: New York _Tribune_, January 18, 1869.]\r\n\r\nTo this galaxy also belonged Henry J. Raymond. He had come into\r\npossession of great fame. His graceful and vigorous work on the\r\n_Times_, supplemented by his incisive speeches and rare intelligence\r\nin conventions, had won many evidences of his party's esteem, but with\r\na desire for office not less pronounced than Greeley's[1027] he coveted\r\na seat in Congress from a district which gave a Tammany majority of\r\n2,000 in 1862. To the surprise of his friends he won by a plurality of\r\n386. It was the greatest victory of the year, and, in the end, led to\r\nthe saddest event of his life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1027: Apropos of Greeley's desire for office, Waldo M.\r\nHutchins when in Congress in 1879 told Joseph G. Cannon, now the\r\ndistinguished speaker of the House of Representatives, that in\r\nSeptember, 1864, during a call upon Greeley, the latter exhibited a\r\nletter from Lincoln two days old, inviting him to the White House.\r\nGreeley, mindful of his efforts to substitute another candidate for\r\nLincoln, said he would not reply and should not go, but Hutchins\r\nfinally gained consent to represent him. Hutchins reached Washington\r\nvery early the next morning, and the President, although clad only in\r\nundershirt and trousers, received him and began enlarging upon the\r\nimportance of a re-election, suggesting that in such event Seward\r\nwould enjoy being minister to England, and that Greeley would make an\r\nadmirable successor to Benjamin Franklin, the first postmaster-general.\r\nHutchins reported this to Greeley, who immediately turned the\r\n_Tribune_ into a Lincoln organ. In the following April Greeley\r\nrecalled Lincoln's statement to Hutchins, who at once left for the\r\ncapital. He reached Washington the morning after the President's\r\nassassination.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE CHANGE OF POLICY\r\n\r\n1865\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the moment the surrender of Lee and the collapse of the\r\nConfederacy left the Democrats without an issue. The war had not been\r\na failure, peace had come without the intervention of a convention of\r\nthe States, the South was \"subjugated,\" the abolition of slavery\r\naccomplished, arbitrary arrests were forgotten, the professed fear of\r\nnational bankruptcy had disappeared, and Seymour's prophetic gift was\r\nin eclipse. Nothing had happened which he predicted--everything had\r\ntranspired which he opposed. Meanwhile, under the administration of\r\nAndrew Johnson, the country was gradually recovering from the awful\r\nshock of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.\r\n\r\nSubstantially following Lincoln's policy, the President had issued, on\r\nMay 29, 1865, a proclamation of amnesty pardoning such as had\r\nparticipated in rebellion,[1028] with restoration of all rights of\r\nproperty except as to slaves, on condition that each take an oath to\r\nsupport the Constitution and to obey the laws respecting emancipation.\r\nHe also prescribed a mode for the reconstruction of States lately in\r\nrebellion. This included the appointment of provisional governors\r\nauthorised to devise the proper machinery for choosing legislatures,\r\nwhich should determine the qualification of electors and\r\noffice-holders. In this preliminary scheme Johnson limited the voters\r\nto white men. Personally he declared himself in favour of a qualified\r\nsuffrage for negroes, but he thought this a matter to be determined by\r\nthe States themselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1028: Except certain specified classes, the most important of\r\nwhich were civil or diplomatic officers of the Confederacy, military\r\nofficers above the rank of colonel, governors of States, former\r\nmembers of Congress who had left their seats to aid the rebellion, and\r\nall who owned property to exceed $20,000 in value. But these excepted\r\npersons might make special application to the President for pardon and\r\nto them clemency would be \"liberally extended.\"]\r\n\r\nA policy that excluded the negro from all participation in public\r\naffairs did not commend itself to the leaders of the Radicals. It was\r\nbelieved that Mississippi's denial of even a limited suffrage to the\r\nnegro, such as obtained in New York, indicated the feeling of the\r\nSouthern people, and the Union conventions of Pennsylvania, dominated\r\nby Thaddeus Stevens, and of Massachusetts, controlled by Charles\r\nSumner, refused to endorse the President's scheme. During the summer\r\nHorace Greeley, in several earnest and able editorials, advocated\r\nnegro suffrage as a just and politic measure, but he carefully avoided\r\nany reflection upon the President, and disclaimed the purpose of\r\nmaking such suffrage an inexorable condition in reconstruction.[1029]\r\nNevertheless, the Radicals of the State hesitated to leave the civil\r\nstatus of coloured men to their former masters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1029: New York _Tribune_, June 14, 15, 20, 26, 28, July 8,\r\n10, 31, August 26, September 20, October 7, 19, 1864.]\r\n\r\nJohnson's policy especially appealed to the Democrats, and at their\r\nState convention, held at Albany on September 9 (1865), they promised\r\nthe President their cordial support, commended his reconstruction\r\npolicy, pledged the payment of the war debt, thanked the army and\r\nnavy, and denounced the denial \"of representation to States in order\r\nto compel them to adopt negro equality or negro suffrage as an element\r\nof their Constitutions.\"[1030] Indeed, with one stroke of the pen the\r\nconvention erased all issues of the war, and with one stroke of the\r\naxe rid itself of the men whom it held responsible for defeat. It\r\navoided Seymour for president of the convention; it nominated for\r\nsecretary of state Henry W. Slocum of Onondaga, formerly a Republican\r\noffice-holder, whose superb leadership as a corps commander placed\r\nhim among New York's most famous soldiers; it preferred John Van\r\nBuren to Samuel J. Tilden for attorney-general; and it refused Manton\r\nMarble's platform, although the able editor of the _World_ enjoyed the\r\nhospitality of the committee room. Further to popularise its action,\r\nit welcomed back to its fold Lucius Robinson, whom it nominated for\r\ncomptroller, an office he was then holding by Republican suffrage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1030: New York _Herald_, September 9.]\r\n\r\nRobinson's political somersault caused no surprise. His dislike of the\r\nLincoln administration, expressed in his letter to the Cleveland\r\nconvention, influenced him to support McClellan, while the Radicals'\r\ntendency to accept negro suffrage weakened his liking for the\r\nRepublican party. However, no unkind words followed his action.\r\n\"Robinson is to-day,\" said the _Tribune_, \"what he has always been, a\r\ngenuine Democrat, a true Republican, a hearty Unionist, and an\r\ninflexibly honest and faithful guardian of the treasury. He has proved\r\na most valuable officer, whom every would-be plunderer of the State\r\nregards with unfeigned detestation, and, if his old associates like\r\nhim well enough to support his re-election, it is a proof that some of\r\nthe false gods they have for years been following have fallen from\r\ntheir pedestals and been crumbled into dust.\"[1031]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1031: New York _Tribune_, September 9, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"The ticket nominated was as follows: Secretary of State, Henry W.\r\nSlocum, Onondaga; Comptroller, Lucius Robinson, Chemung;\r\nAttorney-General, John Van Buren, New York; Treasurer, Marsena R.\r\nPatrick, Ontario; State Engineer, Sylvanus H. Sweet, Oneida; Canal\r\nCommissioner, Cornelius W. Armstrong, Albany; Prison Inspector, Andrew\r\nJ. McNutt, Allegany; Judges of Appeals, John W. Brown, Orange; Martin\r\nGrover, Allegany; Clerk of Appeals, Edward O. Perkins, Kings.\"--New\r\nYork _Herald_, September 9, 1864.]\r\n\r\nThe Union Republican convention, held at Syracuse on September 20,\r\nfollowed the policy of the Democrats in the nomination of Slocum.\r\nOfficers of distinguished service abounded. Daniel E. Sickles, a hero\r\nof Gettysburg; Francis G. Barlow, the intrepid general of Hancock's\r\nfamous corps; Henry W. Barnum, a soldier of decided valour and\r\nenergy; Charles H. Van Wyck, who left Congress to lead a regiment to\r\nthe field; John H. Martindale, a West Point graduate of conspicuous\r\nservice in the Peninsular campaign, and Joseph Howland, whose large\r\nmeans had benefited the soldiers, were especially mentioned. Of this\r\ngalaxy all received recognition save Sickles and Van Wyck, Chauncey M.\r\nDepew being dropped for Barlow, Cochrane for Martindale, Bates for\r\nBarnum, and Schuyler for Howland. In other words, the officials\r\nelected in 1863, entitled by custom to a second term, yielded to the\r\nsentiment that soldiers deserved recognition in preference to\r\ncivilians.[1032]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1032: The ticket nominated was as follows: Secretary of\r\nState, Francis G. Barlow of New York; Comptroller, Thomas Hillhouse of\r\nOntario; Attorney-General, John H. Martindale of Monroe; Treasurer,\r\nJoseph Howland of Dutchess; State Engineer, J. Platt Goodsell of\r\nOneida; Canal Commissioner, Robert C. Dorn of Schenectady; Inspector\r\nof Prisons, Henry W. Barnum of Onondaga; Judges of Court of Appeals,\r\nWard Hunt of Oneida; John K. Porter of Albany; Clerk of Appeals, Henry\r\nJones of Cattaraugus.]\r\n\r\nThe question of negro suffrage troubled the convention. The Radicals\r\nhad a decided majority--\"not less than fifty,\" Greeley said; but Weed\r\nand Raymond, now the acknowledged friends of the President, had the\r\npower. Shortly after Johnson took the oath of office, Preston King\r\npresented Weed to the new Executive and the three breakfasted\r\ntogether. King's relations with the President bore the stamp of\r\nintimacy. They had served together in Congress, and on March 4, 1865,\r\nthat ill-fated inauguration day when Johnson's intoxication humiliated\r\nthe Republic, King concealed him in the home of Francis P. Blair at\r\nSilver Springs, near Washington.[1033] After Lincoln's death King\r\nbecame for a time the President's constant adviser, and through his\r\ninfluence, it was believed, Johnson foreshadowed in one of his early\r\nspeeches a purpose to pursue a more unfriendly policy towards the\r\nSouth than his predecessor had intended. For a time it was thought\r\nKing would displace Seward in the Cabinet if for no other reason than\r\nbecause of the latter's part in defeating the former's re-election to\r\nthe Senate in 1863. However, differences between them were finally\r\nadjusted by King's acceptance of the collectorship of the port of New\r\nYork in place of Draper. This, it was understood, meant a complete\r\nreconciliation of all the factions in the State. Within sixty days\r\nthereafter, King, in a moment of mental aberration, took his life by\r\njumping from a Jersey City ferry-boat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1033: Edward L. Pierce, _Life of Sumner_, Vol. 4, pp. 230,\r\n250.]\r\n\r\nThere was something peculiarly pathetic in the passing of King. In\r\naccepting the collectorship he yielded to the solicitation of friends\r\nwho urged him to retain it after his health, due to worry and\r\noverwork, was seriously impaired. \"He thought it incumbent upon him,\"\r\nsays Weed, \"to sign nothing he did not personally examine, becoming\r\nnervously apprehensive that his bondsmen might suffer.\"[1034] It was\r\nsurmised, also, that the President's change of policy occasioned him\r\nextreme solicitude as well as much embarrassment, since the threatened\r\nbreach between President and Radicals made him sensitive as to his\r\nfuture course. He was a Radical, and, deeply as he regarded the\r\nPresident, he hesitated to hold an office, which, by associating him\r\nwith the Administration, would discredit his sincerity and deprive him\r\nof the right to aid in overthrowing an obnoxious policy. Premeditated\r\nsuicide was shown by the purchase, while on his way to the ferry, of a\r\nbag of shot which sank the body quickly and beyond immediate recovery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1034: _Autobiography of Thurlow Weed_, p. 475.]\r\n\r\nEvery delegate in the Syracuse convention knew that Weed's cordial\r\nrelations with Johnson, established through Preston King, made him the\r\nundisputed dispenser of patronage. Nevertheless, the failure of\r\nPennsylvania and Massachusetts to endorse the President's policy,\r\nsupplemented by Mississippi's action, made a deep impression upon\r\nradical delegates. Besides, it had already been noised abroad that\r\nJohnson could not be influenced. Senator Wade of Ohio discovered it\r\nearly in July, and in August, after two attempts, Stevens gave him up\r\nas inexorable.[1035] \"If something is not done,\" wrote the\r\nPennsylvanian, \"the President will be crowned King before Congress\r\nmeets.\"[1036] Under these circumstances the leading Radicals desired to\r\nvote for a resolution affirming the right of all loyal people of the\r\nSouth to a voice in reorganising and controlling their respective\r\nState governments, and Greeley believed it would have secured a large\r\nmajority on a yea and nay vote.[1037] But Raymond resisted. His\r\nfriendship for Johnson exhibited at the Baltimore convention had\r\nsuddenly made him an acknowledged power with the new Administration\r\nwhich he was soon to represent in Congress, and he did not propose\r\nallowing the _Tribune's_ editor to force New York into the list of\r\nStates that refused to endorse the President.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1035: _Sumner's Works_, Vol. 9, p. 480.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1036: Edward L. Pierce, _Life of Sumner_, Vol. 4, p. 480.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1037: New York _Tribune_, September 21, 1865.]\r\n\r\nSuch a course, he believed, would give the State to the Democrats,\r\nwhose prompt and intrepid confidence in the President had plainly\r\ndisconcerted the Republicans. Besides, Raymond disbelieved in the\r\nviews of the extreme Radicals, who held that States lately in\r\nrebellion must be treated as conquered provinces and brought back into\r\nthe Union as new States, subject to conditions prescribed by their\r\nconquerors. As chairman of the committee on resolutions, therefore,\r\nthe editor of the _Times_ bore down heavily on the Radical dissenters,\r\nand in the absence of a decided leader they allowed their devotion to\r\nmen to overbear attachment to principles. As finally adopted the\r\nplatform recognised Johnson's ability, patriotism, and integrity,\r\ndeclared the war debt sacred, thanked the soldiers and sailors,\r\ncommended the President's policy of reconstruction, and expressed the\r\nhope that when the States lately in rebellion are restored to the\r\nexercise of their constitutional rights, \"it will be done in the faith\r\nand on the basis that they will be exercised in the spirit of equal\r\nand impartial justice, and with a view to the elevation and\r\nperpetuation of the full rights of citizenship of all their people,\r\ninasmuch as these are principles which constitute the basis of our\r\nrepublican institutions.\"[1038] Greeley pronounced this language \"timid\r\nand windy.\"[1039]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1038: New York _Herald_, September 21, 1865.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1039: New York _Tribune_, September 21, 1865.]\r\n\r\nIn the campaign that followed the Democrats flattered the President,\r\nvery cleverly insisting that the Radicals' devotion to negro suffrage\r\nmade them his only real opponents. On the other hand, conservative\r\nRepublicans, maintaining that the convention did not commit itself to\r\nan enfranchisement of the negro, insisted that it was a unit in its\r\nsupport of the President's policy, and that the Democrats, acting\r\ninsincerely, sought to destroy the Union party and secure exclusive\r\ncontrol of the Executive. \"They propose,\" said the _Times_, \"to repeat\r\nupon him precisely the trick which they practised with such brilliant\r\nsuccess upon John Tyler and Millard Fillmore, both of whom were taken\r\nup by the Democracy, their policy endorsed, and their supporters\r\ndenounced. Both were flattered with the promise of a Democratic\r\nnomination and both were weak enough to listen and yield to the\r\ntemptation. Both were used unscrupulously to betray their principles\r\nand their friends, and when the time came both were remorselessly\r\nthrown, like squeezed oranges, into the gutter. The game they are\r\nplaying upon President Johnson is precisely the same. They want the\r\noffices he has in his gift, and when his friends are scattered and\r\noverthrown they will have him at their mercy. Then, the power he gives\r\nthem will be used for his destruction.\"[1040]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1040: New York _Times_, October 17, 1865.]\r\n\r\nHoratio Seymour made two speeches. With charming candor he admitted\r\nthat \"signal victories have been won by generals who have made the\r\nhistory of our country glorious.\" But to him the great debt, the\r\nuntaxed bonds, the inflation of the currency, the increased prices,\r\nand the absence of congressmen from the States lately in rebellion,\r\nseemed as full of peril as war itself. In his address at Seneca Falls\r\nhis field of view, confined to war-burdens and rights withheld from\r\n\"subjugated\" States, did not include the vision that thrilled others,\r\nwho saw the flag floating over every inch of American territory, now\r\nforever freed from slavery. \"When we were free from debt,\" he said, \"a\r\nman could support himself with six hours of daily toil. To-day he must\r\nwork two hours longer to pay his share of the national debt.... This\r\nquestion of debt means less to give your families.... It reaches every\r\nboy and girl, every wife and mother.... It affects the character of\r\nour people.\" Prosperity also troubled him. \"We see upon every hand its\r\nembarrassing effect. The merchant does not know whether he will be a\r\nloser or gainer. We see men who have been ruined without fault, and\r\nmen who have made great fortunes without industry. Inquire of the\r\nperson engaged in mechanical operations and he will say that labour\r\nhas lost its former certain reward.\" He disapproved the national\r\nbanking act because the new banks \"have converted the debt of the\r\ncountry into currency and inflated prices;\" he disputed the\r\ncorrectness of the Treasury debt statement because \"it is the\r\nexperience of all wars that long after their close new claims spring\r\nup, which render the expense at least fifty per cent. more than\r\nappeared by the figures;\" and he condemned the national system of\r\ntaxation because it \"disables us to produce as cheaply at home as we\r\ncan buy in the markets of the world.\"[1041]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1041: New York _World_, November 2, 1865.]\r\n\r\nThe brief campaign promised to be spiritless and without incident\r\nuntil John Van Buren, in his extended canvass for attorney-general,\r\nfreely expressed his opinion of Horatio Seymour. Van Buren was not an\r\nadmirer of that statesman. He had supported him with warmth in 1862,\r\nbut after the development of the Governor's \"passion for peace\" he had\r\nlittle sympathy with and less respect for his administration. In the\r\ncampaign of 1864 he practically ignored him, and the subsequent\r\nannouncement of his defeat liberated Van Buren's tongue. \"Seymour is a\r\ndamned fool,\" he said. \"He spoiled everything at Chicago, and has\r\nbeen the cause of most of the disasters of the Democratic party.\"[1042]\r\nAt Troy he declared that \"the Democracy were suffering now from the\r\ninfernal blunder at Chicago last year,\" and that \"if Seymour and\r\nVallandigham had been kicked out of the national convention it would\r\nhave been a good thing for the party.\"[1043]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1042: From letter of Chauncey M. Depew.--Albany _Evening\r\nJournal_, October 23, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1043: New York _Tribune_, November 3, 1865.]\r\n\r\nThis opinion scarcely expressed the sentiment of a majority of\r\nDemocrats, but those who had preferred John A. Dix as the man of\r\ndestiny held Seymour and his school of statesmen responsible for the\r\nparty's deplorable condition. It had emerged from the war defeated in\r\nevery distinctive principle it had promulgated, and in the absence of\r\nan available issue it now sought to atone for the past and to gain the\r\nconfidence of the people by nominating candidates who were either\r\nactive in the field or recognised as sincerely devoted to a vigorous\r\nprosecution of the war. To aid in this new departure Van Buren threw\r\nhis old-time fire into the campaign, speaking daily and to the delight\r\nof his audiences; but he soon discovered that things were looking\r\nserious, and when the Union Republican ticket was elected by\r\nmajorities ranging from 28,000 to 31,000, with two-thirds of the\r\nAssembly and all the senators save one, he recognised that the glory\r\nof Lee's surrender and the collapse of the Confederacy did not\r\nstrengthen the Democratic party, although one of its candidates had\r\nled an army corps, and another, with eloquence and irresistible\r\nargument, had stirred the hearts of patriotic Americans in the darkest\r\nhours of the rebellion.[1044]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1044: For more than a year Van Buren's health had been\r\nimpaired, and in the spring of 1866 he went to Europe. But a change of\r\nclimate brought no relief, and he died, on the return voyage, at the\r\nage of fifty-six. That the people deeply mourned his loss is the\r\nevidence of those, still living, to whom there was something dashing\r\nand captivating even in his errors.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nRAYMOND CHAMPIONS THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n1866\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Congress convened in December, 1865, President Johnson, in a calm\r\nand carefully prepared message, advocated the admission of Southern\r\ncongressmen whenever their States ratified the Thirteenth Amendment.\r\nHe also recommended that negro suffrage be left to the States. On the\r\nother hand, extreme Radicals, relying upon the report of Carl Schurz,\r\nwhom the President had sent South on a tour of observation, demanded\r\nsuffrage and civil rights for the negro, and that congressional\r\nrepresentation be based upon actual voters instead of population.\r\nSchurz had remained three months in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, and Louisiana, and to him \"treason, under existing\r\ncircumstances, does not appear odious in the South. The people are not\r\nimpressed with any sense of its criminality. And there is yet among\r\nthe Southern people an utter absence of national feeling.... While\r\naccepting the abolition of slavery, they think that some species of\r\nserfdom, peonage, or other form of compulsory labour is not slavery,\r\nand may be introduced without a violation of their pledge.\" Schurz,\r\ntherefore, recommended negro suffrage as \"a condition precedent to\r\nreadmission.\"[1045]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1045: Senate Ex. Doc. No. 2, 39th Cong., 1st Session.]\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, General Grant, who had spent a couple of weeks in the\r\nSouth upon the invitation of the President, reported that the mass of\r\nthinking men accepted conditions in good faith; that they regarded\r\nslavery and the right to secede as settled forever, and were anxious\r\nto return to self-government within the Union as soon as possible;\r\nthat \"while reconstructing they want and require protection from the\r\ngovernment. They are in earnest in wishing to do what is required by\r\nthe government, not humiliating to them as citizens, and if such a\r\ncourse was pointed out they would pursue it in good faith.\"[1046]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1046: McPherson, _History of Reconstruction_, pp. 67-68.]\r\n\r\nThe North had been too happy over the close of the war and the return\r\nof its soldiers to anticipate the next step, but when Thaddeus Stevens\r\nof Pennsylvania, the leader of the Radicals, opened the discussion in\r\nCongress on December 10 (1865), the people quickly saw the drift of\r\nthings. Stevens contended that hostilities had severed the original\r\ncontract between the Southern States and the Union, and that the\r\nformer, in order to return to the Union, must come in as new States\r\nupon terms made by Congress and approved by the President. In like\r\nmanner he argued that negroes, if denied suffrage, should be excluded\r\nfrom the basis of representation, thus giving the South 46\r\nrepresentatives instead of 83. \"But why should slaves be excluded?\"\r\ndemanded Stevens. \"This doctrine of a white man's government is as\r\natrocious as the infamous sentiment that damned the late Chief Justice\r\nto everlasting fame, and, I fear, to everlasting fire.\"[1047]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1047: _Congressional Globe_, Vol. 37, Part 1, pp. 73-74.]\r\n\r\nStevens' speech, putting Johnson's policy squarely in issue, was\r\nanswered by Henry J. Raymond, now the selected and acknowledged leader\r\nof the Administration in the House. Raymond had entered Congress with\r\na prestige rarely if ever equalled by a new member. There had been\r\ngreater orators, abler debaters, and more profound statesmen, but no\r\none had ever preceded him with an environment more influential. He was\r\nthe favourite of the President; he had been brought into more or less\r\nintimate association with all the men of his party worth knowing; he\r\nwas the close friend of Weed and the recognized ally of Seward; his\r\ngood will could make postmasters and collectors, and his displeasure,\r\nlike that of a frigid and bloodless leader, could carry swift penalty.\r\nIndeed, there was nothing in the armory of the best equipped\r\npolitician, including able speaking and forceful writing, that he did\r\nnot possess, and out of New York as well as within it he had been\r\nregarded the earnest friend and faithful champion of Republican\r\ndoctrines. On the surface, too, it is doubtful if a member of\r\nCongress, whether new or old, ever seemed to have a better chance of\r\nwinning in a debate. Only three months before the people of the North,\r\nwith great unanimity, had endorsed the President and approved his\r\npolicy. Besides, the great body of Republicans in Congress preferred\r\nto work with the President. He held the patronage, he had succeeded by\r\nthe assassin's work to the leadership of the party, and thus far had\r\nevinced no more dogmatism than Stevens or Sumner. Moreover, the\r\nsentiment of the North at that time was clearly against negro\r\nsuffrage. All the States save six[1048] denied the vote to the negro,\r\nand in the recent elections three States had specifically declared\r\nagainst extending it to him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1048: New York and the New England States except Connecticut,\r\nalthough New York required a property qualification, but none for the\r\nwhite.]\r\n\r\nThus fortified Raymond did not object to speaking for the\r\nAdministration. To him Stevens' idea of subjecting the South to the\r\ndiscipline and tutelage of Congress was repulsive, and his ringing\r\nvoice filled the spacious hall of the House with clear-cut sentences.\r\nHe denied that the Southern States had ever been out of the Union. \"If\r\nthey were,\" he asked, \"how and when did they become so? By what\r\nspecific act, at what precise time, did any one of those States take\r\nitself out of the American Union? Was it by the ordinance of\r\nsecession? An ordinance of secession is simply a nullity, because it\r\nencounters the Constitution which is the supreme law of the land. Did\r\nthe resolutions of those States, the declaration of their officials,\r\nthe speeches of the members of their Legislatures, or the utterances\r\nof their press, accomplish the result desired? Certainly not. All\r\nthese were declarations of a purpose to secede. Their secession, if it\r\never took place, certainly could not date from the time when their\r\nintention to secede was first announced. They proceeded to sustain\r\ntheir purpose of secession by arms against the force which the United\r\nStates brought to bear against them. Were their arms victorious? If\r\nthey were, then their secession was an accomplished fact. If not, it\r\nwas nothing more than an abortive attempt--a purpose unfulfilled. They\r\nfailed to maintain their ground by force of arms. In other words, they\r\nfailed to secede. But if,\" he concluded, \"the Southern States did go\r\nout of the Union, it would make those in the South who resisted the\r\nConfederacy guilty of treason to an independent government. Do you\r\nwant to make traitors out of loyal men?\"[1049]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1049: _Congressional Globe_, Vol. 37, Part 1, pp. 120-123.]\r\n\r\nRaymond received close attention. Several leaders acknowledged their\r\ninterest by asking questions, and the congratulations that followed\r\nevidenced the good will of his colleagues. His speech had shown none\r\nof the usual characteristics of a maiden effort. Without advertising\r\nhis intention to speak, he obtained the floor late in the afternoon,\r\nreferred with spirit to the sentiments of the preceding speaker, and\r\nmoved along with the air of an old member, careless of making a\r\nrhetorical impression but intensely in earnest in what he had to\r\npresent. As an argument in favor of the adoption of a liberal policy\r\ntoward the South, regardless of its strict legal rights, the speech\r\ncommended itself to his colleagues as an admirable one, but it\r\nentirely failed to meet Stevens' logic that the States lately in\r\nrebellion could not set up any rights against the conqueror except\r\nsuch as were granted by the laws of war. In his reply the\r\nPennsylvanian taunted Raymond with failing to quote a single authority\r\nin support of his contention. \"I admit the gravity of the gentleman's\r\nopinion,\" he said, \"and with the slightest corroborating authority\r\nshould yield the case. But without some such aid I am not willing that\r\nthe sages of the law--Grotius, Vattel, and a long line of\r\ncompeers--should be overthrown and demolished by the single arm of the\r\ngentleman from New York. I pray the gentleman to quote authority; not\r\nto put too heavy a load upon his own judgment; he might sink under the\r\nweight. Give us your author.\"[1050]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1050: _Congressional Globe_, Vol. 37, Part 2, pp. 1307-1308.]\r\n\r\nAs the debate continued it became evident the President's friends were\r\nlosing ground. Aside from the withering blows of Stevens, unseen\r\noccurrences which Raymond, in his eagerness to champion Johnson's\r\npolicy, did not appreciate or willingly ignored, had a most disturbing\r\ninfluence. The Northern people welcomed peace and approved the\r\ngenerosity of the government, but they wanted the South to exhibit its\r\nappreciation by corresponding generosity to the government's friends.\r\nIts acts did not show this. Enactments in respect to freedmen, passed\r\nby the President's reconstructed legislatures, grudgingly bestowed\r\ncivil rights. A different punishment for the same offence was\r\nprescribed for the negroes; apprentice, vagrant, and contract labour\r\nlaws tended to a system of peonage; and the prohibition of public\r\nassemblies, the restriction of freedom of movement, and the\r\ndeprivation of means of defence illustrated the inequality of their\r\nrights. Such laws, for whatever purpose passed, had a powerful effect\r\non Northern sentiment already influenced by reported cruelties, while\r\nthe Southern people's aversion to Union soldiers settling in their\r\nmidst intensified the feeling. Moreover, Southern and Democratic\r\nsupport of the President made Republicans distrust his policy. If\r\nStates can be reconstructed in a summer and congressmen admitted in a\r\nwinter, it was said, the South, helped by the Democracy of the North,\r\nmight again be in control of the Government within two years. These\r\nconsiderations were bound to affect the judgment of Republicans, and\r\nwhen Stevens began to talk and the real conditions in the South came\r\nto be known, it aroused party indignation to a high pitch in the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nRaymond, in his brilliant rejoinders, endeavoured to recover lost\r\nground. He had created no enemies. On the contrary his courtesy and\r\ntact smoothed the way and made him friends. But after weeks of\r\ndiscussion an effort to adopt a resolution of confidence in the\r\nPresident met with overwhelming defeat. Stevens asked that the\r\nresolution be referred to the Committee on Reconstruction--Raymond\r\ndemanded its adoption at once. On a roll-call the vote stood 32 to 107\r\nin favour of reference, Raymond and William A. Darling of New York\r\nCity being the only Republicans to vote against it. It was a heavy\r\nblow to the leader of the Conservatives. It proved the unpopularity of\r\nJohnson's policy and indicated increasing estrangement between the\r\nPresident and his party. Moreover, it was personally humiliating. On a\r\ntest question, with the whole power of the Administration behind him,\r\nRaymond had been able, after weeks of work, to secure the support of\r\nonly one man and that a colleague bound to him by the ties of personal\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nThe division in the party spread with the rapidity of a rising thunder\r\ncloud. On February 6 Congress passed the Freedman's Bureau Bill,\r\ndesigned to aid helpless negroes, which the President vetoed. A month\r\nlater his treatment of the Civil Rights Bill, which set in motion the\r\nnecessary machinery to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment, shattered the\r\nconfidence of the party. \"Surely,\" declared Senator Trumbull of\r\nIllinois, \"we have authority to enact a law as efficient in the\r\ninterest of freedom as we had in the interest of slavery.\"[1051] But\r\nthe President promptly vetoed it, because, he said, it conferred\r\ncitizenship on the negro, invaded the rights of the States, had no\r\nwarrant in the Constitution, and was contrary to all precedent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1051: _Congressional Globe_, p. 474.]\r\n\r\nThe President had developed several undesirable characteristics, being\r\nessentially obstinate and conceited, the possessor of a bad temper,\r\nand of a coarse and vulgar personality. His speech on February 22, in\r\nwhich he had invoked the wild passions of a mob, modified the opinions\r\neven of conservative men. \"It is impossible to conceive of a more\r\nhumiliating spectacle,\" said Sherman.[1052] \"During the progress of\r\nevents,\" wrote Weed, \"the President was bereft of judgment and reason,\r\nand became the victim of passion and unreason.\"[1053] But up to this\r\ntime the party had hoped to avoid a complete break with the Executive.\r\nNow, however, the question of passing the Civil Rights Bill over his\r\nveto presented itself. Not since the beginning of the government had\r\nCongress carried an important measure over a veto. Besides, it meant a\r\ncomplete and final separation between the President and his party.\r\nEdwin D. Morgan so understood it, and although he had heretofore\r\nsustained the President, he now stood with the Radicals. Raymond also\r\nknew the gravity of the situation. But Raymond, who often wavered and\r\nsometimes exhibited an astonishing fickleness,[1054] saw only one side\r\nto the question, and on April 9 when the House, by a vote of 122 to\r\n41, overrode the veto, he was one of only seven Unionists to support\r\nthe President.[1055]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1052: _Congressional Globe_, Appendix, p. 124.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1053: T.W. Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 1, p. 630.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1054: Augustus Maverick, _Life of Henry J. Raymond_, p. 225.\r\n\r\nApropos of Raymond's fickleness Stevens remarked, when the former\r\nappealed to his friends on the floor to furnish him a pair, that he\r\nsaw no reason for it, since he had observed that the gentleman from\r\nNew York found no difficulty in pairing with himself.--William M.\r\nStewart, _Reminiscences_, pp. 205-206.\r\n\r\nAt another time when an excited member declared that Stevens commands\r\nus to \"go it blind,\" Hale of New York, with an innocent expression,\r\nasked the meaning of the phrase. Instantly Stevens retorted: \"It means\r\nfollowing Raymond.\" The hit was doubly happy since Hale had followed\r\nRaymond in his support of Johnson.--Boutwell, _Reminiscences_, Vol. 2,\r\np. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1055: Edward McPherson, _History of the Reconstruction_, p.\r\n81.]\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the Civil Rights Bill the President's friends\r\nproposed to invoke, through a National Union convention to be held at\r\nPhiladelphia on August 14, the support of conservative Republicans\r\nand Democrats. Weed told Raymond of the project and Seward urged it\r\nupon him. Raymond expressed a disinclination to go to the convention\r\nbecause it seemed likely to fall into the hands of former Confederates\r\nand their Northern associates, and to be used for purposes hostile to\r\nthe Union party, of which, he said, he was not only a member, but the\r\nchairman of its national committee. Seward did not concur in this\r\nview. He said it was not a party convention and need not affect the\r\nparty standing of those who attended it. He was a Union man, he\r\ndeclared, and he did not admit the right of anybody to turn him out of\r\nthe Union party. Moreover, he wanted Raymond to attend the convention\r\nto prevent its control by the enemies of the Union party.\r\n\r\nRaymond, still undecided, called with Seward upon the President, who\r\nfavoured neither a new party nor the restoration to power of the\r\nDemocratic party, although the movement, he said, ought not to repel\r\nDemocrats willing to act with it. He wanted the matter settled within\r\nthe Union party, and thought the proposed convention, in which\r\ndelegates from all the States could again meet in harmony, would exert\r\na wholesome influence on local conventions and nominations to\r\nCongress.[1056] Raymond, however, was still apprehensive. He deemed the\r\nThirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments \"reasonable, wise, and popular;\"\r\nthought the President had \"made a great mistake in taking grounds\r\nagainst them;\" and declared that notwithstanding the peppery method of\r\ntheir passage \"the people will not be stopped by trifles.\" The outcome\r\nof the convention also worried him. \"If it should happen to lay down a\r\nplatform,\" he continued, \"which shall command the respect of the\r\ncountry, it would be such a miracle as we have no right to expect in\r\nthese days. However,\" he concluded, \"I shall be governed in my course\r\ntoward it by developments. I do not see the necessity of denouncing\r\nit from the start, nor until more is known of its composition,\r\npurposes, and actions.\"[1057]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1056: The above statement is based upon the diary of Raymond,\r\npublished by his son.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1057: Letter of July 17.--Augustus Maverick, _Life of\r\nRaymond_, pp. 173-174.]\r\n\r\nRaymond did not attend the preliminary State convention held at\r\nSaratoga on August 9. He left this work to Weed, who, with the help of\r\nDean Richmond, made an excellent showing in numbers and enthusiasm.\r\nThe support of the Democrats was assured because they would benefit,\r\nand the presence of Tilden, Kernan, William H. Ludlow, and Sanford E.\r\nChurch created no surprise; but the interest manifested by John A.\r\nDix, Hamilton Fish, Moses Taylor, Marshall O. Roberts, Francis B.\r\nCutting, and Richard M. Blatchford amazed the Republicans. Henry J.\r\nRaymond was made a delegate-at-large, with Samuel J. Tilden, John A.\r\nDix, and Sanford E. Church.\r\n\r\nAt Philadelphia the convention derived a manifest advantage from\r\nhaving all the States, South as well as North, fully represented,\r\nmaking it the first real \"National\" convention to assemble, it was\r\nsaid, since 1860. Besides, it was a picturesque convention, full of\r\nstriking contrasts and unique spectacles. In the hotel lobbies Weed\r\nand Richmond, walking together, seemed ubiquitous as they dominated\r\nthe management and arranged the details. Raymond and Church sat side\r\nby side in the committee on resolutions, while the delegates from\r\nMassachusetts and South Carolina, for spectacular effect, entered the\r\ngreat wigwam arm in arm. This picture of apparent reconciliation\r\nevoked the most enthusiastic cheers, and became the boast of the\r\nJohnsonians until the wits likened the wigwam to Noah's Ark, into\r\nwhich there went, \"two and two, of clean beasts, and of beasts that\r\nare not clean, and of fowls, and of everything that creepeth upon the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nJohn A. Dix became temporary chairman, and the resolutions, reciting\r\nthe issue between the President and the Republicans, laid great\r\nemphasis upon the right of every State, without condition, to\r\nrepresentation in Congress as soon as the war had ended. But Raymond,\r\npresumably to please Southern delegates,[1058] pressed the argument far\r\nbeyond the scope of the resolutions, maintaining that even if the\r\ncondition of the Southern States rendered their admission unsafe\r\nbecause still disloyal in sentiment and purpose, Congress had no power\r\nto deny them rights conferred by the Constitution. This reckless claim\r\namazed his friends as much as it aroused his enemies, and he at once\r\nbecame the object of most cutting reproaches. \"Had he been elected as\r\na Copperhead,\" said the _Tribune_, \"no one could have complained that\r\nhe acted as a Copperhead, and had Judas been one of the Pharisees\r\ninstead of one of the Disciples, he would not be the worst example\r\nthat Presidents and Congressmen can follow.\"[1059] Ten days later the\r\nRepublican National committee removed him from the chairmanship, a\r\npunishment promptly followed by his removal from the committee.[1060]\r\nRaymond, in his talk with Seward, had anticipated trouble of this\r\ncharacter, but the humiliation was now doubly deep because it\r\nseparated him from friends whose staunch support had contributed to\r\nhis strength. Moreover, in a few weeks he was compelled to abandon the\r\nPresident for reasons that had long existed. \"We have tried hard,\" he\r\nwrote, \"to hold our original faith in his personal honesty, and to\r\nattribute his disastrous action to errors of judgment and infirmities\r\nof temper. The struggle has often been difficult, and we can maintain\r\nit no longer.\"[1061] But the change came too late. He had followed too\r\nfar. It added to the sadness, also, because his popularity was never\r\nto return to any considerable extent during the remaining three years\r\nof his brilliant life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1058: New York _Tribune_, August 22, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1059: _Ibid._, September 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1060: _Ibid._, September 4 and 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1061: Augustus Maverick, _Life of Raymond_, p. 174.]\r\n\r\nRaymond's congressional experience, confined to a single term, added\r\nnothing to his fame. He delivered clever speeches, his wide\r\nintelligence and courteous manner won him popularity, and to some\r\nextent he probably influenced public opinion; but his brief career\r\nleft no opportunity to live down his fatal alliance with Johnson.\r\nIndeed, it may well be doubted if longer service or more favourable\r\nconditions would have given him high standing as a legislator.\r\nProminence gained in one vocation is rarely transferred to another.\r\nLegislation is a profession as much as medicine or law or journalism,\r\nthe practice of which, to gain leadership, must be long and\r\ncontinuous, until proposed public measures and their treatment worked\r\nout in the drudgery of the committee room, become as familiar as the\r\nvariety of questions submitted to lawyers and physicians. The\r\nprolonged and exacting labour as a journalist which had given Raymond\r\nhis great reputation, must, in a measure, have been repeated as a\r\nlegislator to give him similar leadership in Congress. At forty-five\r\nhe was not too old to accomplish it. Samuel Shellabarger of Ohio, who\r\nmade his greatest speech in reply to Raymond, began his congressional\r\nlife at forty-nine, and Thaddeus Stevens, the leader of the House, at\r\nfifty-seven. But the mental weariness, already apparent in Raymond's\r\nface, indicated that the enthusiasm necessary for such preparation had\r\ndeparted. Besides, he lacked the most important qualification for a\r\nlegislative leader--the rare political sagacity to know the thoughts\r\nof people and to catch the tiniest shadow of a coming event.\r\n\r\nSeward shared Raymond's unpopularity. Soon after assuming office\r\nPresident Johnson outlined a severe policy toward the South, violently\r\ndenouncing traitors, who, he declared, must be punished and\r\nimpoverished. \"The time has arrived,\" he said, \"when the American\r\npeople should be educated that treason is the highest crime and those\r\nengaged in it should suffer all its penalties.\"[1062] These sentiments,\r\nreiterated again and again, extorted from Benjamin F. Wade, the chief\r\nof Radicals, an entreaty that he would limit the number to be hung to\r\na good round dozen and no more.[1063] Suddenly the President changed\r\nhis tone to one of amnesty and reconciliation, and in answering the\r\nquestion, \"who has influenced him?\" Sumner declared that \"Seward is\r\nthe marplot. He openly confesses that he counselled the present fatal\r\npolicy.\"[1064] Blaine also expressed the belief that the Secretary of\r\nState changed the President's policy,[1065] a suggestion that Seward\r\nhimself corroborated in an after-dinner speech at New York in\r\nSeptember, 1866. \"When Mr. Johnson came into the Presidency,\" said the\r\nSecretary, \"he did nothing until I got well, and then he sent for me\r\nand we fixed things.\"[1066]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1062: McPherson's _Reconstruction_, p. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1063: Blaine's _Twenty Tears of Congress_, Vol. 2, p. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1064: Edward L. Pierce, _Life of Sumner_, Vol. 4, p. 376;\r\nSumner's _Works_, Vol. 11, p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1065: James G. Blaine, _Twenty Years of Congress_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1066: New York _Tribune_, September 4, 1866.]\r\n\r\nBut Seward did more to exasperate Republicans than change a harsh\r\npolicy to one of reconciliation. He believed in the soundness of the\r\nPresident's constitutional views and the correctness of his vetoes,\r\ndeeming the course of Congress unwise.[1067] It is difficult,\r\ntherefore, to credit Blaine's unsupported statement that Seward\r\n\"worked most earnestly to bring about an accommodation between the\r\nAdministration and Congress.\"[1068] The split grew out of the\r\nPresident's veto messages which Seward approved and probably wrote.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1067: Thornton K. Lothrop, _Life of Seward_, p. 424.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1068: James G. Blaine, _Twenty Years of Congress_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n115.]\r\n\r\nUntil the spring of 1866 Seward's old friends believed he had remained\r\nin the Cabinet to dispose of diplomatic questions which the war left\r\nunsettled, but after his speech at Auburn on May 22 the men who once\r\nregarded him as a champion of liberty and equality dropped him from\r\ntheir list of saints. He argued that the country wanted reconciliation\r\ninstead of reconstruction, and denied that the President was\r\nunfaithful to the party and its cardinal principles of public policy,\r\nsince his disagreements with Congress on the Freedman's Bureau and\r\nCivil Rights Bills \"have no real bearing upon the question of\r\nreconciliation.\" Nor was there any \"soundness in our political\r\nsystem, if the personal or civil rights of white or black, free born\r\nor emancipated, are not more secure under the administration of a\r\nState government than they could be under the administration of the\r\nNational government.\"[1069] This sentiment brought severe criticism.\r\n\"Mr. Seward once earned honour by remembering the negro at a time when\r\nothers forgot him,\" said the _Independent_; \"he now earns dishonour by\r\nforgetting the negro when the nation demands that the negro should be\r\nremembered.\"[1070]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1069: This speech does not appear in his _Works_, but was\r\npublished at the time of its delivery in pamphlet form.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1070: New York _Independent_, May 31, 1866.]\r\n\r\nSeward's participation in the President's tour of the country\r\ncontributed to destroy his popularity. This Quixotic junketing journey\r\nquickly passed into history as the \"swinging-around-the-circle\" trip,\r\nwhich Lowell described as an \"advertising tour of a policy in want of\r\na party.\"[1071] Seward had many misgivings. The memory of the\r\nPresident's condition on inauguration day and of his unfortunate\r\nspeech on February 22 did not augur well for its success. \"But it is a\r\nduty to the President and to the country,\" he wrote, \"and I shall go\r\non with right good heart.\"[1072] In the East the party got on very\r\nwell, but at Cleveland and other Western cities the President acted\r\nlike a man both mad and drunk, while people railed at him as if he\r\nwere the clown of a circus. \"He sunk the Presidential office to the\r\nlevel of a grog-house,\" wrote John Sherman.[1073]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1071: James Russell Lowell, _Political Essays_, p. 296.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1072: F.W. Seward, _Life of W.H. Seward_, Vol. 3, p. 339.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1073: Sherman's Letters, p. 278.]\r\n\r\nSeward's position throughout was pathetic. His apologies and\r\ncommonplace appeals for his Chief contrasted strangely with the\r\ncourageous, powerful, and steady fight against the domination of\r\nslavery which characterised his former visits to Cleveland, and the\r\nmen who had accepted him as their ardent champion deprecated both his\r\nacts and his words. It called to mind Fillmore's desertion of his\r\nanti-slavery professions, and Van Buren's revengeful action in 1848.\r\n\"Distrusted by his old friends,\" said the _Nation_, \"he will never be\r\ntaken to the bosom of his old enemies. His trouble is not that the\r\nparty to which he once belonged is without a leader, but that he\r\nwanders about like a ghost--a leader without a party.\"[1074]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1074: New York _Nation_, Vol. 3, p. 234.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHOFFMAN DEFEATED, CONKLING PROMOTED\r\n\r\n1866\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knowledge that Republicans, to overcome the President's vetoes,\r\nmust have a two-thirds majority in Congress, precipitated a State\r\ncampaign of unusual energy. The contest which began on April 9, when\r\nJohnson disapproved the Civil Rights Bill, was intensified by the\r\nPhiladelphia convention and the President's \"swing-around-the-circle;\"\r\nbut the events that made men bitter and deeply in earnest were the\r\nMemphis and New Orleans riots, in which one hundred and eighty negroes\r\nwere killed and only eleven of their assailants injured. To the North\r\nthis became an object-lesson, illustrating the insincerity of the\r\nSouth's desire, expressed at Philadelphia, for reconciliation and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe Republican State convention, meeting at Syracuse on September 5,\r\nechoed this sentiment. In the centre of the stage the Stars and\r\nStripes, gracefully festooned, formed a halo over the portrait of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, while a Nast caricature of President Johnson betrayed\r\nthe contempt of the enthusiastic gathering. Weed and Raymond were\r\nconspicuous by their absence. The Radicals made Charles H. Van Wyck\r\nchairman, Lyman Tremaine president, George William Curtis chairman of\r\nthe committee on resolutions, and Horace Greeley the lion of the\r\nconvention. At the latter's appearance delegates leaped to their feet\r\nand gave three rounds of vociferous cheers. The day's greatest\r\ndemonstration, however, occurred when the chairman, in his opening\r\nspeech, stigmatised the New York friends of the President.[1075] Van\r\nWyck prudently censored his bitterness from the press copy, but the\r\nepisode reflected the intense unpopularity of Seward, Weed, and\r\nRaymond.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1075: New York _Tribune_, September 6, 1866.]\r\n\r\nIn the privacy of the club Seward's old-time champions had spoken of\r\n\"the decline of his abilities,\" \"the loss of his wits,\" and \"that\r\ndry-rot of the mind's noble temper;\" but now, in a crowded public\r\nhall, they cheered any sentiment that charged a betrayal of trust and\r\nthe loss of principles. Of course Seward had not lost his principles,\r\nnor betrayed his trust. He held the opinions then that he entertained\r\nbefore the removal of the splints and bandages from the wounds\r\ninflicted by the bowie-knife of the would-be assassin. He had been in\r\nthorough accord with Lincoln's amnesty proclamation, issued in\r\nDecember, 1863, as well as with his \"Louisiana plan\" of\r\nreconstruction, and Johnson's proclamation and plan of reconstruction,\r\nwritten under Seward's influence, did not differ materially. But\r\nSeward's principles which rarely harmonised with those of the\r\nRadicals, now became more conspicuous and sharply defined because of\r\nthe tactlessness and uncompromising spirit of Lincoln's successor.\r\nBesides, he was held responsible for the President's follies. To a\r\nconvention filled with crutches, scarred faces, armless sleeves, and\r\nrepresentatives of Andersonville and Libby Prisons, such an attitude\r\nseemed like a betrayal of his trust, and the resentment of the\r\ndelegates, perhaps, was not unnatural.\r\n\r\nIf Seward was discredited, Reuben E. Fenton was conspicuously trusted.\r\nAccording to Andrew D. White, a prominent State senator of that day,\r\nthe Governor was not a star of the magnitude of his Republican\r\npredecessors.[1076] Others probably held the same opinion. Fenton's\r\nparty, however, renominated him by acclamation, and then showed its\r\ninconsistency by refusing a like honour to Thomas G. Alvord, the\r\nlieutenant-governor. The service of the Onondaga Chief, as his friends\r\ndelighted to call him, had been as creditable if not as important as\r\nthe Governor's, but the brilliant gifts of Stewart L. Woodford, a\r\nyoung soldier of patriotic impulses, attracted a large majority of the\r\nconvention.[1077] Up to that time, Woodford, then thirty years of age,\r\nwas the youngest man nominated for lieutenant-governor. He had made a\r\nconspicuous sacrifice to become a soldier. In 1861 Lincoln appointed\r\nhim an assistant United States attorney, but the silenced guns of\r\nSumter inspired him to raise a company, and he marched away at its\r\nhead, leaving the civil office to another. Later he became commandant\r\nof the city that sheltered the guns first trained upon the American\r\nflag, and after his return, disciplined and saddened by scenes of\r\ncourage and sacrifice, the clarion notes of the young orator easily\r\ncommanded the emotions of his hearers. No one ever wearied when he\r\nspoke. His lightest word, sent thrilling to the rim of a vast\r\naudience, swayed it with the magic of control. He was not then at the\r\nfulness of his power or reputation, but delegates had heard enough to\r\ndesire his presence in the important campaign of 1866, and to\r\nstimulate his activity they made him a candidate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1076: \"There stood Fenton, marking the lowest point in the\r\nchoice of a State executive ever reached in our Commonwealth by the\r\nRepublican party.\"--_Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 131.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1077: \"The Republican ticket was as follows: Governor, Reuben\r\nE. Fenton, Chautauqua; Lieutenant-Governor, Stewart L. Woodford,\r\nKings; Canal Commissioner, Stephen T. Hoyt, Steuben; Prison Inspector,\r\nJohn Hammond, Essex.\"--New York _Tribune_, September 7, 1866.]\r\n\r\nThe platform declared that while the constitutional authority of the\r\nFederal government cannot be impaired by the act of a State or its\r\npeople, a State may, by rebellion, so far rupture its relations to the\r\nUnion as to suspend its power to exercise the rights which it\r\npossessed under the Constitution; that it belonged to the legislative\r\npower of the government to determine at what time a State may safely\r\nresume the exercise of its rights; and that the doctrine that such\r\nState is itself to judge when it is in proper condition to resume its\r\nplace in the Union is false, as well as the other doctrine that the\r\nPresident was alone sole judge of the period when such suspension\r\nshall be at an end.\r\n\r\nIf these propositions created no surprise, the refusal squarely to\r\nmeet the suffrage issue created much adverse comment. One resolution\r\nexpressed a hope that the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment would\r\ntend to the equalisation of all political rights among citizens of the\r\nUnion, but although Greeley submitted a suffrage plank, as he did in\r\nthe preceding year, Curtis carefully avoided an expression favourable\r\neven to the colored troops.\r\n\r\n\"Extreme opinions usually derive a certain amount of strength from\r\nlogical consistency,\" wrote Raymond. \"Between the antecedent\r\nproposition of an argument and its practical conclusion there is\r\nordinarily a connection which commends itself to the advocates of\r\nprinciple. But the radicalism which proposes to reconstruct the Union\r\nhas not this recommendation. Its principles and its policy are not\r\nmore alike than fire and water. What it contends for theoretically it\r\nsurrenders practically.\"[1078] Although this was clearly a just\r\ncriticism, the radicalism of Congress showed more leniency in practice\r\nthan in theory. The Northern people themselves were not yet ready for\r\nnegro suffrage, and had the South promptly accepted the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment and the congressional plan of reconstruction, it is doubtful\r\nif the Fifteenth Amendment would have been heard of.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1078: New York _Times_ (editorial), September 7, 1866.]\r\n\r\nConservative Republicans, however, were too well satisfied with their\r\nwork at Philadelphia to appreciate this tendency of Congress. The\r\nevidence of reconciliation had been spectacular, if not sincere, and\r\nthey believed public opinion was with them. The country, it was\r\nargued, required peace; the people have made up their minds to have\r\npeace; and to insure peace the Southern States must enjoy their\r\nconstitutional right to seats in Congress. \"This is the one question\r\nnow before the country,\" said the _Post_; \"and all men of every party\r\nwho desire the good of the country and can see what is immediately\r\nnecessary to produce this good, will unite to send to Congress only\r\nmen who will vote for the immediate admission of Southern\r\nrepresentatives.\"[1079] In the opinion of such journals the situation\r\npresented a rare opportunity to the Democratic party. By becoming the\r\nvehicle to bring real peace and good will to the country, it would not\r\nonly efface its questionable war record, but it could \"spike the guns\"\r\nof the Radicals, control Congress, sustain the President, and carry\r\nthe Empire State. This was the hope of Raymond and of Weed, back of\r\nwhom, it was said, stood tens of thousands of Republicans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1079: New York _Evening Post_, August 27, 1866.]\r\n\r\nTo aid in the accomplishment of this work, great reliance had been\r\nplaced upon the tour of the President. Raymond reluctantly admitted\r\nthat these anticipations were far from realised,[1080] although the\r\nmanagers thought the tour through New York, where the President had\r\nbeen fairly discreet, was of value in marshalling the sentiment of\r\nRepublicans. Besides, it seemed to them to show, in rural districts\r\nand towns as well as in the commercial centres, a decided preference\r\nfor a policy aimed to effect the union of all the States according to\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1080: New York _Times_, September 7.]\r\n\r\nTo encourage the coöperation of Republicans, the Democrats, led by\r\nDean Richmond, agreed, temporarily at least, to merge their name and\r\norganisation in that of the National Union party. This arrangement was\r\nnot easily accomplished. The _World_ hesitated and the _Leader_\r\nridiculed, but when the Democracy of the State approved, these\r\njournals acquiesced.[1081] In obedience to this understanding the\r\nDemocratic State committee called a National Union State convention,\r\nand invited all to participate who favoured the principles enunciated\r\nby the Philadelphia convention. The obscuration of State policies and\r\npartisan prejudices made this broad and patriotic overture, devoted\r\nexclusively to a more perfect peace, sound as soft and winning as the\r\nspider's invitation to the fly. \"If the action of the convention is in\r\nharmony with the spirit of the call,\" wrote Raymond, \"it cannot fail\r\nto command a large degree of popular support.\"[1082] As county\r\ndelegations equally divided between Republicans and Democrats arrived\r\nat Albany on September 11, it was apparent that the invitation had\r\nbeen accepted at its face value. Although no Republican of prominence\r\nappeared save Thurlow Weed, many Republicans of repute in their\r\nrespective localities answered to the roll call. These men favoured\r\nJohn A. Dix for governor. To them he stood distinctly for the specific\r\npolicy announced at Philadelphia. In his opening address at that\r\nconvention he had sounded the keynote, declaring a speedy restoration\r\nof the Union by the admission of Southern representatives to Congress\r\na necessary condition of safe political and party action. Besides, Dix\r\nhad been a Democrat all his life, a devoted supporter of the\r\ngovernment during the war, and it was believed his career would\r\ncommand the largest measure of public confidence in the present\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1081: Letter of Thurlow Weed, New York _Times_, October 9,\r\n1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1082: New York _Times_, September 10, 1866.]\r\n\r\nThis had been the opinion of Dean Richmond, whose death on August 27\r\ndeprived the convention of his distinguished leadership. This was also\r\nthe view of Edwards Pierrepont, then as afterward a powerful factor in\r\nwhatever circle he entered. Although a staunch Democrat, Pierrepont\r\nhad announced, at the historic meeting in Union Square on April 20,\r\n1861, an unqualified devotion to the government, and had accepted,\r\nwith James T. Brady and Hamilton Fish, a place on the union defence\r\ncommittee. Later, he served on a commission with Dix to try prisoners\r\nof state, and in 1864 advocated the election of Lincoln. There was no\r\ndough about Pierrepont. He had shown himself an embodied influence,\r\nspeaking with force, and usually with success. He possessed the grit\r\nand the breadth of his ancestors, one of whom was a chief founder of\r\nYale College, and his presence in the State convention, although he\r\nhad not been at Philadelphia, encouraged the hope that it would\r\nconcentrate the conservative sentiment and strength of New York, and\r\nrestore Democracy to popular confidence. Stimulated by his\r\nearnestness, the up-State delegates, when the convention opened, had\r\npractically settled Dix's nomination.\r\n\r\nThere were other candidates. A few preferred Robert H. Pruyn of\r\nAlbany, a Republican of practical energy and large political\r\nexperience, and until lately minister to Italy, while others thought\r\nwell of Henry C. Murphy of Brooklyn, a Democrat and State senator of\r\nrecognised ability. But next to Dix the favourite was John T. Hoffman,\r\nthen mayor of New York. It had been many years since the Democrats of\r\nthe metropolis had had a State executive. Edwards Pierrepont said that\r\n\"no man in the convention was born when the last Democratic governor\r\nwas elected from New York or Brooklyn.\"[1083] This, of course, was\r\nhyperbole, since Pierrepont himself could remember when, at the\r\nopening of the Erie Canal, Governor DeWitt Clinton, amidst the roar of\r\nartillery and the eloquence of many orators, passed through the locks\r\nat Albany, uniting the waters of Lake Erie with those of the Hudson.\r\nPerhaps the thought of Clinton, climbing from the mayoralty to the\r\nmore distinguished office of governor, added to the desire of Hoffman,\r\nfor although the latter's capacity was limited in comparison with the\r\nastonishing versatility and mental activity of Clinton, he was not\r\nwithout marked ability.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1083: New York _Times_, September 13, 1866.]\r\n\r\nHoffman's life had been full of sunshine and success. He was a\r\ndistinguished student at Union College, an excellent lawyer, an\r\neffective speaker, and a superb gentleman. Slenderly but strongly\r\nbuilt, his square, firm chin and prominent features, relieved by large\r\nbrown eyes, quickly attracted attention as he appeared in public. \"In\r\nthe winter of 1866,\" wrote Rhodes, \"I used frequently to see him at an\r\nearly morning hour walking down Broadway on his way to the City Hall.\r\nTall and erect, under forty and in full mental and physical vigor, he\r\npresented a distinguished appearance and was looked at with interest\r\nas he passed with long elastic strides. He was regarded as one of the\r\ncoming men of the nation. He had the air of a very successful man who\r\nis well satisfied with himself and confident that affairs in general\r\nare working for his advantage.\"[1084]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1084: James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n6, p. 401, note.]\r\n\r\nNot always overstocked with eligibles whom it could admire and trust,\r\nTammany, proud of the young man's accomplishments, elected him in\r\n1860, at the age of thirty-two, recorder of the city, the presiding\r\nofficer of what was then the principal criminal court. Here he\r\nacquitted himself, especially in the draft riot of 1863, with such\r\ncredit that Republicans and Democrats united in re-electing him, and\r\nin 1865, before the expiration of his second term as recorder, Tammany\r\nmade him mayor. It was a hard, close contest. Indeed, success could\r\nnot have come to Tammany without the aid of Hoffman's increasing\r\npopularity. This office, however, plunged him at once into partisan\r\npolitics, and gave to his career an uncertain character, as if a turn\r\nof chance would decide what path of political life he was next to\r\nfollow. Now, at the age of thirty-eight, Tammany proposed making him\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nBut Hoffman represented neither the principles nor the purposes of the\r\nPhiladelphia convention. The success of that movement depended largely\r\nupon the pre-eminent fitness of the men who led it. The question was,\r\nwould the State be safer in the hands of a well-known Democratic\r\nstatesman like Dix than in the control of Fenton and the Radicals? Dix\r\nstood for everything honest and conservative. For more than three\r\ndecades his prudence had been indissolubly associated with the wise\r\ndiscretion of William L. Marcy and Silas Wright, while Hoffman, the\r\nexponent of unpurged Democracy, charged with promoting its welfare and\r\nsuccess, was the one man whom conservative Republicans wished to\r\navoid, and whom, in their forcible presentation of Dix, they were\r\ndriving out of the race.\r\n\r\nDemocratic leaders saw the situation with alarm. They had endorsed the\r\nPhiladelphia movement to get into power,--not to give it to Dix and\r\nthe Conservatives. The President's reconstruction policy, benefiting\r\ntheir party in the South and thus strengthening it in national\r\nelections, had been adopted with sincerity, but they did not seriously\r\npropose to merge their organisation in the State with another, giving\r\nit the reins and the whip. \"The New York delegation to Philadelphia,\"\r\nsaid the _World_, \"was appointed by a gathering of politicians at\r\nSaratoga, who neither represented, had any authority to bind, nor made\r\nany pretence of binding the Democratic organisation of the\r\nState.\"[1085] Indeed, it was treated as a surprising revelation that\r\nconservative Republicans and Dix Democrats should come to Albany with\r\nsuch a notion. However, the Dix appeal, developing wonderful strength,\r\ncould not be reasoned with, and in their desperation the Democrats\r\nsought an adjournment until the morrow. This the convention refused,\r\ngranting only a recess until four o'clock. In the meantime Dix's\r\nchances strengthened. It was plain that his nomination, on lines\r\napproved by Seward, meant a split in Republican ranks, and the\r\nup-State delegates, fearing delay, stood for early action. Then came\r\nthe inevitable trick. On reassembling a motion to adjourn was voted\r\ndown three to one, but Sanford E. Church, the chairman, declaring it\r\ncarried, put on his hat and quickly left the hall. It was an audacious\r\nproceeding. Two-thirds of the convention stood aghast, and Church, the\r\nnext morning, found it necessary to make an abject apology.\r\nNevertheless, his purpose had been accomplished. Adjournment gave\r\nTammany the time fiercely to assail Dix, who was now charged with\r\nconsigning Democrats to Fort Lafayette, suppressing Democratic\r\nlegislatures, and opposing Seymour in 1864. John Morrissey, the\r\npugilist and congressman, declared that Dix could not poll twenty\r\nthousand votes in New York City. Meanwhile Democratic leaders, closing\r\nthe door against Weed and the Conservatives, quietly agreed upon\r\nHoffman. Had Dean Richmond lived a month longer this _coup d'état_\r\nwould probably not have occurred. In vigour of intellect, in terseness\r\nof expression, and in grasp of questions presented for consideration,\r\nRichmond was recognised as the first unofficial man in America, and he\r\nhad long thought it time for the Democratic party to get into step\r\nwith the progress of events.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1085: New York _World_, October 5, 1866.]\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as pre-arranged, Edwards Pierrepont took the floor,\r\nand after characterising the assembly as a Democratic convention whose\r\nprogramme had been settled in advance by Democrats, he formally and\r\napparently with the assent of Dix coolly withdrew the latter's name,\r\nmoving that the nomination of John T. Hoffman be made by\r\nacclamation.[1086] This was carried with shouts of wild exultation.\r\nMany Dix supporters, anticipating the outcome, had silently left the\r\nhall, but enough remained to hear, with profound astonishment, the\r\nconfession of Pierrepont that he had united with Tammany for the\r\nnomination of Hoffman before the meeting of the Philadelphia\r\nconvention. Why, then, it was asked, did he advocate Dix the day\r\nbefore? and upon whose authority did he withdraw Dix's name? After\r\nsuch an exposure it could not be said of Pierrepont that he was\r\nwithout guile. \"It was the occasion of especial surprise and regret,\"\r\nwrote Weed, \"that even before the National Union State convention had\r\nconcluded its labours, Judge Pierrepont should have assumed that it\r\nwas a Democratic convention, and that its programme had been settled\r\nin advance by Democrats. This was not less a surprise when I\r\nremembered that on the day previous to that announcement, Judge\r\nPierrepont concurred fully with me in the opinion that the nomination\r\nof General Dix for governor was expedient and desirable.\"[1087]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1086: The ticket was as follows: Governor, John T. Hoffman,\r\nNew York; Lieutenant-Governor, Robert H. Pruyn, Albany; Canal\r\nCommissioner, William W. Wright; Prison Inspector, Frank B. Gallagher,\r\nErie.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1087: New York _Times_, October 9, 1866.]\r\n\r\nBut the worst blow to a union of political interests was yet to come.\r\nTo afford the people safety in their persons, security in their\r\nproperty, and honesty in the administration of their government, a\r\nRepublican Legislature had placed the affairs of New York City largely\r\nin control of Boards and Commissions. Tammany naturally resented this\r\ninvasion of home rule, and after reaffirming the principles of the\r\nPhiladelphia movement, the convention declared that \"recent\r\nlegislation at Albany has usurped a supreme yet fitful control of the\r\nlocal affairs which counties and municipalities are entitled to\r\nregulate.\"[1088] To Conservatives nothing could have been more\r\noffensive than such a declaration. \"There are thousands of\r\nRepublicans,\" said Raymond, \"who long for a restoration of the Union\r\nby the admission to their seats in Congress of loyal men from loyal\r\nStates, but who will be quite likely to prefer taking their chances of\r\nsecuring this result from the action of the Republican party, modified\r\nas it may be by reflection and moderate counsels, rather than seek it\r\nin the way marked out for them by the Albany Democratic\r\nconvention.\"[1089]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1088: New York _Times_, September 13, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1089: _Ibid._, September 17.]\r\n\r\nThus the clash began. Conservatives resented the evident intention of\r\nthe Democrats to strengthen their party at the expense of the\r\nPhiladelphia movement. \"We desire to call special attention,\" said a\r\nBuffalo paper, \"to the necessity of carrying out in good faith the\r\nunderstanding which was entered into at the Philadelphia convention\r\nthat all old party antecedents and future action should be merged in\r\nthe National Union organisation. It was not contemplated then, or\r\nsince, to strengthen the Democratic party by that movement, and any\r\neffort in that direction now cannot fail to be mischievous.\"[1090]\r\nBefore the month of September expired Raymond warned the _World_ that\r\nhe was not pledged to the action of the Albany convention. \"No\r\nRepublican went into it for any such purpose,\" he said. \"No hint of\r\nputting it to any such use was given in the call or in any of its\r\npreliminary proceedings. The convention was called to give effect to\r\nthe principles and policy of the Philadelphia convention, and\r\nRepublicans who approved those principles concurred in the call. But\r\nhow did this give that convention the right to commit them in favour\r\nof measures alien from its ostensible purpose, and at war with their\r\nentire political action? It is utterly preposterous to suppose that\r\nthey can coöperate with the Democratic party in the accomplishment of\r\nany such design.\"[1091]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1090: Buffalo _Commercial Advertiser_, September 14, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1091: New York _Times_, September 27, 1866.]\r\n\r\nFive days later Raymond announced his support of the Republican\r\nticket.[1092] It was significant of his sincerity that he declined to\r\nrun again for Congress. Thomas E. Stewart, a conservative Republican,\r\nwas easily elected in the Sixth District, and Raymond could have had\r\nthe same vote, but without \"the approval of those who originally gave\r\nme their suffrage,\" he said, \"a seat in Congress ceases to have any\r\nattraction. With the Democratic party, as it has been organised and\r\ndirected since the rebellion broke out, I have nothing in\r\ncommon.\"[1093] It is impossible not to feel a high respect for the\r\nmanner in which Raymond, having come to this determination, at once\r\nacted upon it. He resented no criticism; he allowed no gleam of\r\nfeeling to creep into his editorials. Few men could have avoided the\r\ntemptation to assume the tone of the wronged one who endures much and\r\nwill not complain. Instinctively, however, Raymond felt the bad taste\r\nand unwisdom of such a style, and he joined heartily and\r\ngood-naturedly in the effort to elect Reuben E. Fenton.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1092: _Ibid._, October 2, 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1093: _Ibid._, September 27.]\r\n\r\nThurlow Weed, on the other hand, remained a Conservative. Indeed, he\r\nwent a step farther in the way of irreconciliation, preferring Hoffman\r\nand Tammany, he said, to \"the reckless, red-radicalism which rules the\r\npresent Congress.... The men who now lead the radical crusade against\r\nthe President,\" he continued, explanatory of his course, \"attempted\r\nduring the war to divide the North. That calamity was averted by the\r\nfirmness and patriotism of conservative Republicans. In 1864 the same\r\nleaders, as hostile to Mr. Lincoln as they are to President Johnson,\r\nattempted to defeat his election by a flank movement at Cleveland.\r\nMr. Greeley wrote private letters to prominent Republicans inviting\r\ntheir coöperation in a scheme to defeat Mr. Lincoln's election. The\r\nsame leaders went to Washington last December with the deliberate\r\nintention to quarrel with the President, who up to that day and hour\r\nhad followed in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor. Their\r\ndenunciations have been systematic and fiendish. If, under a keen\r\nsense of injustice, he has since erred in judgment or temper, none\r\nwill deny the sufficiency of the provocation. That it would have been\r\nwiser, though less manly, to forbear, I admit. But no nature, merely\r\nhuman, excepting, perhaps, that of Abraham Lincoln, can patiently\r\nendure wanton public indignities and contumely.\"[1094]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1094: New York _Times_, October 9, 1866.]\r\n\r\nAfter the October elections it became apparent that the North would\r\nsupport Congress rather than the President. One cause of distrust was\r\nthe latter's replacement of Republican office-holders with men noted\r\nfor disloyalty during the war. Weed complained that the appointment of\r\nan obnoxious postmaster in Brooklyn \"has cost us thousands of votes in\r\nthat city.\"[1095] During the campaign Johnson removed twelve hundred\r\nand eighty-three postmasters, and relatively as many custom-house\r\nemployés and internal revenue officers.[1096] Among the latter was\r\nPhilip Dorsheimer of Buffalo. Indeed, the sweep equalled the violent\r\naction of the Council of Appointment in the days when DeWitt Clinton\r\nand Ambrose Spencer, resenting opposition to Morgan Lewis, sent Peter\r\nB. Porter to the political guillotine for supporting Aaron Burr. Such\r\nwholesale removals, however, did not arrest the progress of the\r\nRepublican party. After Johnson's \"swing around the circle,\"\r\nConservatives were reduced to a few prominent men who could not\r\nconsistently retrace their steps, and to hungry office-holders who\r\nwere known as \"the bread and butter brigade.\"[1097] The _Post_, a\r\nloyal advocate of the President's policy, thought it a melancholy\r\nreflection \"That its most damaging opponent is the President, who\r\nmakes a judicious course so hateful to the people that no argument is\r\nlistened to, and no appeals to reason, to the Constitution, to common\r\nsense, can gain a hearing.\"[1098] Henry Ward Beecher voiced a similar\r\nlament. The great divine had suffered severe criticism for casting his\r\nlarge influence on the side of Johnson, and he now saw success melting\r\naway because of the President's vicious course. \"Mr. Johnson just now\r\nand for some time past,\" he wrote, \"has been the greatest obstacle in\r\nthe way of his own views. The mere fact that he holds them is their\r\ncondemnation with a public utterly exasperated with his rudeness and\r\nviolence.\"[1099] A few weeks later the Brooklyn minister, tired of the\r\ninsincerity of the President and of his Philadelphia movement, opened\r\nthe campaign with a characteristic speech in support of the Republican\r\ncandidates.[1100]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1095: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1096: The _Nation_, September 6, p. 191; September 27, p.\r\n241.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1097: New York _Tribune_, October 1, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1098: New York _Evening Post_, September 11, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1099: Extract from private letter, September 6, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1100: New York _Tribune_, October 16, 1866.]\r\n\r\nIn animation, frequent meetings, and depth of interest, the campaign\r\nresembled a Presidential contest. The issues were largely national. As\r\none of the disastrous results of Johnson's reconstruction policy,\r\nRepublicans pointed to the New Orleans and Memphis massacres,\r\nintensified by the charge of the Southern loyalists that \"more than a\r\nthousand devoted Union citizens have been murdered in cold blood since\r\nthe surrender of Lee.\"[1101] The horrors of Andersonville, illuminated\r\nby eye witnesses, and the delay to try Jefferson Davis, added to the\r\nexasperation. On the other hand, Democrats traced Southern conditions\r\nto opposition to the President's policy, charging Congress with a base\r\nbetrayal of the Constitution in requiring the late Confederate States\r\nto ratify the Fourteenth Amendment as a condition precedent to the\r\nadmission of their representatives. The great debate attracted to the\r\nrostrum the ablest and best known speakers. For the Republicans,\r\nRoscoe Conkling, sounding the accepted keynote, now for the first\r\ntime made an extended tour of the State, speaking in fourteen towns\r\nand cities. On the other hand, true to the traditions of his life,\r\nJohn A. Dix threw his influence on the side of the President.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1101: _Ibid._, September 7.]\r\n\r\nHoffman, also, patiently traversed the State, discussing\r\nconstitutional and legal principles with the care of an able lawyer.\r\nThere was much in Hoffman himself to attract the enthusiasm of popular\r\nassemblages. Kind and sympathetic, with a firm dignity that avoided\r\nundue familiarity, he was irresistibly fascinating to men as he moved\r\namong them. He had an attractive presence, a genial manner, and a good\r\nname. He had, too, a peculiar capacity for understanding and pleasing\r\npeople, being liberal and spontaneous in his expressions of sympathy,\r\nand apparently earnest in his attachment to principle. He was not an\r\norator. He lacked dash, brilliant rhetoric, and attractive figures of\r\nspeech. He rarely stirred the emotions. But he pleased people. They\r\nfelt themselves in the presence of one whom they could trust as well\r\nas admire. The Democratic party wanted a new hero, and the favourite\r\nyoung mayor seemed cut out to supply the want.\r\n\r\nHowever, Hoffman did not escape the barbed criticism of the Republican\r\npress. Raymond had spoken of his ability and purity, and of his course\r\nduring the war as patriotic.[1102] Weed, also, had said that \"during\r\nthe rebellion he was loyal to the government and Union.\"[1103] To\r\novercome these certificates of character, the _Tribune_ declared that\r\n\"Saturn is not more hopelessly bound with rings than he. Rings of\r\ncouncilmen, rings of aldermen, rings of railroad corporations, hold\r\nhim in their charmed circles, and would, if he were elected, use his\r\ninfluence to plunder the treasury and the people.\"[1104] It also\r\ncharged him with being disloyal. In 1866 and for several years later\r\nthe standing of pronounced Copperheads was similar to that of Tories\r\nafter the Revolution, and it seriously crippled a candidate for office\r\nto be classed among them. Moreover, it was easy to discredit a\r\nDemocrat's loyalty. To most members of the Union party the name itself\r\nclothed a man with suspicion, and the slightest specification, like\r\nthe outcropping of a ledge of rocks, indicated that much more was\r\nconcealed than had been shown. On this theory, the Republican press,\r\ndeeming it desirable, if not absolutely essential, to put Hoffman into\r\nthe disloyal class, accepted the memory of men who heard him speak at\r\nSing Sing, his native town, in 1864. As they remembered, he had\r\ndeclared that \"Democrats only had gone to war;\" that \"volunteering\r\nstopped when Lincoln declared for an abolition policy;\" and that he\r\n\"would advise revolution and resistance to the government\" if Lincoln\r\nwas elected without Tennessee being represented in the electoral\r\ncollege.[1105] Other men told how \"at one of the darkest periods of the\r\nwar, Hoffman urged an immediate sale of United States securities, then\r\nunder his control and held by the sinking fund of the city.\"[1106] In\r\nthe _Tribune's_ opinion such convenient recollections of unnamed and\r\nunknown men made him a \"Copperhead.\"[1107]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1102: New York _Times_, September 13, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1103: _Ibid._, September 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1104: New York _Tribune_, November 1, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1105: New York _Tribune_, Oct. 5, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1106: _Ibid._, Oct. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1107: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nAlthough New York indicated the same direction of the popular will\r\nthat had manifested itself in Pennsylvania and other October States,\r\nthe heavy and fraudulent registration in New York City encouraged the\r\nbelief that Tammany would overcome the up-State vote.[1108] However,\r\nthe pronounced antagonism to the President proved too serious a\r\nhandicap, and the Radicals, electing Fenton by 13,000 majority,[1109]\r\ncarried both branches of the Legislature, and twenty out of thirty-one\r\ncongressmen. It was regarded a great victory for Fenton, who was\r\nreally opposed by one of the most formidable combinations known to the\r\npolitics of the State. Besides the full strength of the Democratic\r\nparty, the combined liquor interest antagonised him, while the Weed\r\nforces, backed by the Johnsonised federal officials, were not less\r\npotent. Indeed, Seward publicly predicted Republican defeat by 40,000\r\nmajority.[1110]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1108: Gustavus Myers, _History of Tammany Hall_, p. 250.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1109: Fenton, 366,315; Hoffman, 352,526.--_Civil List, State\r\nof New York_, 1887, p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1110: New York _Tribune_, January 18, 1869.]\r\n\r\nThe result also insured the election of a Republican to the United\r\nStates Senate to succeed Ira Harris on March 4, 1867. Candidates for\r\nthe high honour were numerous. Before the end of November Horace\r\nGreeley, having suffered defeat for Congress in the Fourth District,\r\nserved notice of his desire.[1111] George William Curtis had a like\r\nambition. Lyman Tremaine, too, was willing. Charles J. Folger, the\r\nstrong man of the State Senate, belonged in the same class, and Ransom\r\nBalcom of Binghamton, who had achieved an enviable reputation as a\r\nSupreme Court judge, also had his friends. But the three men seriously\r\ntalked of were Ira Harris, Noah Davis, and Roscoe Conkling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1111: _Ibid._, November 9, 1866.]\r\n\r\nHarris had been something of a disappointment. He had performed the\r\nduties of judge and legislator with marked ability, but in Washington,\r\ninstead of exercising an adequate influence on the floor of the\r\nSenate, he contented himself with voting, performing committee work,\r\nand attending to the personal wants of soldiers and other\r\nconstituents. President Lincoln, referring to the Senator's\r\npersistency in pressing candidates for office, once said: \"I never\r\nthink of going to sleep now without first looking under my bed to see\r\nif Judge Harris is not there wanting something for somebody.\"[1112]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1112: Andrew D. White, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 134.]\r\n\r\nDavis had been on the Supreme bench since 1857, and although he had\r\nhad little opportunity to develop statesmanship, his enthusiastic\r\ndevotion to the Union had discovered resources of argument and a\r\nfearless independence which were destined to win him great fame in the\r\ntrial of William M. Tweed. People liked his nerve, believed in his\r\nhonesty, confided in his judgment, and revelled in the retorts that\r\nleaped to his lips. There was no question, either, how he would stand\r\nif called to vote upon the impeachment of the President, a proceeding\r\nalready outlined and practically determined upon by the majority in\r\nCongress. This could not be said with confidence of Ira Harris.\r\nAlthough his radicalism had stiffened as the time for a re-election\r\napproached, he had not always been terribly in earnest. It was not his\r\nnature to jump to the support of a measure that happened to please the\r\nfancy of the moment. Yet his votes followed those of Senator\r\nFessenden, and his voice, if not strong in debate, expressed the\r\nwisdom and judgment of a safe counsellor.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives Conkling had displayed real ability.\r\nTime had vindicated his reasons for demanding a bankrupt law, and his\r\nvoice, raised for economy in the public expense, had made him of\r\nspecial service during the war. He voted to reduce the mileage of\r\ncongressmen, he opposed the creation of wide-open commissions, and he\r\naided in uncovering frauds in the recruiting service. In the darkest\r\nhour of rebellion he approved Vallandigham's arrest and refused to\r\njoin a movement to displace Lincoln for another candidate. On his\r\nreturn to Congress, after his defeat in 1862, he had passed to the\r\nCommittee on Ways and Means, and to the Joint Committee on\r\nReconstruction. Of the Radicals no one surpassed him in diligence and\r\nenergy. He voted to confiscate the property of rebels, he stood with\r\nStevens for disfranchising all persons who voluntarily adhered to the\r\nlate insurrection until July 4, 1870, and he would agree to no plan\r\nthat operated to disfranchise the coloured population. Indeed, to the\r\nsystem of constructive legislation which represented the plan of\r\nreconstruction devised by Congress, he practically devoted his time.\r\n\r\nOf the New York delegation Conkling was admittedly the ablest speaker,\r\nalthough in a House which numbered among its members James A.\r\nGarfield, Thaddeus Stevens, and James G. Blaine, he was not an\r\nadmitted star of the first magnitude. Blaine's serious oratorical\r\ncastigation, administered after a display of offensive manners, had\r\ndisarmed him except in resentment.[1113] The _Times_ spoke of him as\r\nof \"secondary rank,\"[1114] and the _Tribune_, the great organ of the\r\nparty, had declined to put upon him the seal of its approval. Besides,\r\nhis vanity and arrogance, although not yet a fruitful subject of the\r\ncomic literature of the day, disparaged almost as much as his\r\nbrilliant rhetoric exalted him. Careful observers, however, had not\r\nfailed to measure Conkling's ability. From Paris, William Cullen\r\nBryant wrote his friends to make every effort to nominate him, and\r\nParke Godwin extended the same quality of support.[1115] His recent\r\ncampaign, too, had made men proud of him. Although disaffected\r\nRepublicans sought to drive him from public life, and the _Tribune_\r\nhad withheld its encouragement, he gained a great triumph.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1113: \"As to the gentleman's cruel sarcasm,\" said Blaine, \"I\r\nhope he will not be too severe. The contempt of that large-minded\r\ngentleman is so wilting, his haughty disdain, his grandiloquent swell,\r\nhis majestic, supereminent, overpowering, turkey-gobbler strut has\r\nbeen so crushing to myself and all the members of this House, that I\r\nknow it was an act of the greatest temerity for me to venture upon a\r\ncontroversy with him.\" Referring to a comparison which had been made\r\nof Conkling to Henry Winter Davis, Blaine continued: \"The gentleman\r\ntook it seriously, and it has given his strut additional pomposity.\r\nThe resemblance is great; it is striking. Hyperion to a Satyr,\r\nThersites to Hercules, mud to marble, dunghill to diamond, a singed\r\ncat to a Bengal tiger, a whining puppy to a roaring lion.\"--_Congressional\r\nGlobe_, April 20, 1866, Vol. 37, Part 3, p. 2298.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think Conkling was the equal in debate with Blaine.\"--George\r\nF. Hoar, _Autobiography_, Vol. 2, p. 55. \"Conkling was the more\r\ndignified and commanding, but Blaine more aggravating and personal.\r\nWhen Blaine likened Conkling to a strutting turkey-gobbler, the House\r\nslightly hissed. But on the whole that debate was regarded as a\r\ndraw.\"--William M. Stewart, _Reminiscences_, p. 206.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1114: New York _Times_, January 3, 1867.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1115: A.R. Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, pp. 286-7.]\r\n\r\nBut men talked geography. Seward and Preston King had represented\r\nwestern New York, and since Morgan had succeeded King, a western man,\r\nit was argued, should succeed Harris. This strengthened Noah Davis.\r\nNever in the history of the State, declared his friends, had a United\r\nStates senator been taken from territory west of Cayuga Bridge, a\r\nsection having over one million people, and giving in the recent\r\nelection 27,000 Republican majority. On this and the strength of their\r\ncandidate the western counties relied, with the further hope of\r\ninheriting Harris' strength whenever it left him. On the other hand,\r\nHarris sought support as the second choice of the Davis men. Greeley\r\nnever really got into the race. Organisation would probably not have\r\navailed him, but after serving notice upon his friends that their\r\nardent and button-holing support would not be sanctioned by him, the\r\nimpression obtained that Greeley was as ridiculous as his letter.[1116]\r\nWhen Lyman Tremaine withdrew from the contest he threw his influence\r\nto Conkling. This jolted Harris. Then Andrew D. White changed from\r\nCurtis to the Oneidan. Curtis understood the situation too well to\r\nbecome active. \"The only chance,\" he wrote, \"is a bitter deadlock\r\nbetween the three, or two, chiefs. The friends of Davis proposed to me\r\nto make a combination against Conkling, the terms being the election\r\nof whichever was stronger now,--Davis or me,--and the pledges of the\r\nsuccessful man to support the other two years hence. I declined\r\nabsolutely.\"[1117] As Harris weakened, Reuben E. Fenton, hopeful of\r\nbecoming Edwin D. Morgan's successor in 1869, restrained any rush to\r\nDavis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1116: New York _Tribune_, November 9, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1117: Edward Cary, _Life of Curtis_, p. 193.]\r\n\r\nThe potential influence of Ellis H. Roberts, editor of the Utica\r\n_Herald_, a paper of large circulation in northern and central New\r\nYork, proved of great assistance to Conkling. Roberts was of Welsh\r\norigin, a scholar in politics, strong with the pen, and conspicuously\r\nprominent in the discussion of economic issues. When in Congress\r\n(1871-75) he served upon the Ways and Means Committee. In 1867 his\r\nfriends sent him to the Assembly especially to promote the election of\r\nUtica's favourite son, and in his sincere, earnest efforts he very\r\nnearly consolidated the Republican press of the State in Conkling's\r\nbehalf. During the week's fierce contest at Albany he marshalled his\r\nforces with rare skill, not forgetting that vigilance brings\r\nvictory.[1118]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1118: Conkling and Roberts quarrelled in the early\r\nseventies--the former, perhaps, unwilling to have two great men in\r\nOneida County--and Roberts was defeated for Congress in 1874. After\r\nthat the Utica _Herald_ became Conkling's bitterest enemy. See\r\ninterviews, New York _Herald_, November 9, 1877, and New York\r\n_Tribune_, November 10, 1877.]\r\n\r\nThus the strife, without bitterness because free from factional\r\nstrife, remained for several days at white-heat. \"On reaching here\r\nTuesday night,\" Conkling wrote his wife, \"the crowd took and held\r\npossession of me till about three o'clock the next morning. Hundreds\r\ncame and went, and until Thursday night this continued from early\r\nmorning to early morning again. The contest is a very curious and\r\ncomplex one. Great sums of money are among the influences here. I have\r\nresolutely put down my foot that no friend of mine, even without my\r\nknowledge, shall pay a cent, upon any pretext nor in any strait, come\r\nwhat will. If chosen, it will be by the men of character, and if\r\nbeaten this will be my consolation. The gamblers say that I can have\r\n$200,000 here from New York in a moment if I choose, and that the\r\nmembers are fools to elect me without it.\"[1119] As evidence of the\r\nwant of faith in legislative virtue, the _Times_ gave the answer of a\r\nveteran lobbyist, who was asked respecting the chances of Freeman\r\nClarke. \"Who's Clark?\" he inquired. \"Formerly the comptroller of the\r\ncurrency,\" was the reply. \"Oh, yes,\" said the lobbyist; \"and if he\r\ncontrolled the currency now, he would have a sure thing of it.\"[1120]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1119: A.R. Conkling, _Life of Roscoe Conkling_, pp. 286-287.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1120: New York _Times_, January 4, 1867.]\r\n\r\nConkling's winning card was his forensic ability. In the United State\r\nSenate, since the days of Seward, New York had been weak in debating\r\npower, and the party's desire to be represented by one who could place\r\nthe Empire State in the front rank of influence appealed strongly to\r\nmany of the legislators. Andrew D. White, therefore, raised a\r\nwhirlwind of applause at the caucus when he declared, in seconding\r\nConkling's nomination, that what the Empire State wanted was not\r\njudicial talent \"but a voice.\"[1121]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1121: New York _Times_, January 10.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, so evenly did the members divide that it took five\r\nballots to make a nomination. Conkling led on the first ballot and\r\nDavis on the second. On the third, Conkling stood one ahead, and three\r\non the fourth, with Harris clinging to six votes. The disposition of\r\nthese six would make a senator, and by gaining them Conkling became\r\nthe nominee on the fifth ballot.[1122] Had they gone to Noah Davis,\r\nFenton's way to the Senate in 1869 must have been blocked. But the\r\nGovernor was watchful. At the critical moment on the last ballot, one\r\nvote which had been twice thrown for Davis went back to Folger. The\r\nChautauquan did not propose to take any chances.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1122: The vote by ballots stood as follows:\r\n\r\n               First   Second   Third  Fourth  Fifth\r\nConkling        33       39      45      53     59\r\nDavis           30       41      44      50     49\r\nHarris          32       24      18       6     --\r\nBalcom           7        4       2      --     --\r\nGreeley          6       --      --      --     --\r\nFolger           1        1      --      --      1\r\n\r\nThe Democratic caucus, held the same evening, nominated Henry C.\r\nMurphy of Brooklyn, who received 25 votes to 21 for A. Oakey Hall of\r\nNew York.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF TWEEDISM\r\n\r\n1867\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election of Roscoe Conkling to the United States Senate made him\r\nthe most prominent, if not the most influential politician in New\r\nYork. \"No new senator,\" said a Washington paper, \"has ever made in so\r\nshort a time such rapid strides to a commanding position in that\r\nbody.\"[1123]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1123: Washington _Chronicle_, March 28, 1867.]\r\n\r\nConkling was not yet established, however. His friends who wished to\r\nmake him chairman of the Republican State convention which assembled\r\nat Syracuse on September 24, 1867, discovered that he was not beloved\r\nby the Radical leaders. He had a habit of speaking his own mind, and\r\ninstead of confining his thoughts to the committee room, or whispering\r\nthem in the ears of a few alleged leaders, it was his custom to take\r\nthe public into his confidence. Horace Greeley, jealous of his\r\nprerogative, disapproved such independence, and Governor Fenton, the\r\n_Tribune's_ protégé, had apprehensions for his own leadership.\r\nBesides, it was becoming more apparent each day that the men who did\r\nnot like Greeley and preferred other leadership to Fenton's, thought\r\nwell of Conkling. He was not a wild partisan. Although a stiff Radical\r\nhe had no reason to feel bitter toward men who happened to differ with\r\nhim on governmental policies. His life did not run back into the\r\nquarrels between Greeley and Thurlow Weed, and he had no disposition\r\nto be tangled up with them; but when he discovered that Greeley had\r\nlittle use for him, he easily formed friendships among men who had\r\nlittle use for Greeley. It was noticeable that Conkling did not\r\ncriticise Raymond's erratic run after Andrew Johnson. He heard\r\nShellabarger's stinging reply, he listened to the editor's hopeless\r\nappeal for support, and he voted against the resolution of confidence\r\nin the President, but he added nothing to Raymond's humiliation.\r\nPerhaps this accounted for the latter's appreciation of the young\r\nSenator. At all events, the _Times_ complimented while the _Tribune_\r\nremained silent. It was evident the great Republican organ did not\r\nintend advertising the ability of the strenuous, self-asserting\r\nSenator, who was rapidly becoming a leader.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this jealousy quickly betrayed itself to Conkling's\r\nadmirers at the State convention. On the surface men were calm and\r\nresponsive. But in forming the committee on permanent organisation\r\nFenton's supporters, who easily controlled the convention, secretly\r\narranged to make Lyman Tremaine chairman. When this plan came to the\r\nears of the Conkling men, one of them, with the shrewdness of a\r\ngenuine politician, surprised the schemers by moving to instruct the\r\ncommittee to report the Senator for permanent president. This made it\r\nnecessary to accept or squarely to reject him, and wishing to avoid\r\nopen opposition, the Governor's managers allowed the convention to\r\nacquiesce in the motion amid the vociferous cheers of the Senator's\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nConkling's speech on this occasion was one of interest. He outlined a\r\npolicy for which, he contended, his party in the Empire State ought to\r\nstand. This was a new departure in New York. Heretofore, its chosen\r\nrepresentatives, keeping silent until a way had been mapped out in\r\nWashington or elsewhere, preferred to follow. Conkling preferred to\r\nlead. There was probably not a Republican in the State capable of\r\nforming an opinion who did not know that from the moment Conkling\r\nbecame a senator the division of the party into two stout factions was\r\nmerely a question of time. That time had not yet come, but even then\r\nit was evident to the eye of a close observer that the action of the\r\nRadicals, led by Fenton, turned in a measure upon their distrust of\r\nConkling and his supporters.\r\n\r\nThis was manifest in the cool treatment accorded the New York City\r\ndelegates who represented the bolting Republicans of the year before.\r\nConkling's friends, disposed to be liberal, argued that the vote of a\r\n\"returning sinner\" counted as much on election day as that of a saint.\r\nOn the other hand, the Fenton forces, while willing to benefit by the\r\nsuffrage of Conservatives, were disinclined to admit to the convention\r\nmen tainted with the sin of party treason, who would naturally\r\nstrengthen their adversaries. In the end, after a fierce struggle\r\nwhich absorbed an entire session, the Conservatives were left out.\r\n\r\nOpposition to the State officials who had shown a disposition to\r\nfavour the Senator was less open but no less effective. The exposure\r\nof canal frauds in the preceding winter, showing that for a period of\r\nsix years trifling causes had been deemed sufficient to displace low\r\nbids for high ones, thus greatly enriching a canal ring at the expense\r\nof the State, involved only the Canal Commissioner. Indeed, every\r\nreason existed why Barlow and his soldier associates whose army\r\nrecords had strengthened their party in 1865 should receive the usual\r\nendorsement of a renomination; but to avoid what, it was claimed,\r\nmight otherwise be regarded an invidious distinction, the Greeley\r\nRadicals cleverly secured a new ticket.[1124] \"In their zeal to become\r\nhonest,\" said Horatio Seymour, \"the Republicans have pitched overboard\r\nall the officials who have not robbed the treasury.\"[1125]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1124: The following were nominated: Secretary of State, James\r\nB. McKean, Saratoga; Comptroller, Calvin T. Hulburd, St. Lawrence;\r\nTreasurer, Theodore B. Gates, Ulster; Attorney-General, Joshua M. Van\r\nCott, Kings; State Engineer, Archibald C. Powell, Onondaga; Canal\r\nCommissioner, John M. Hammond, Allegany; Prison Inspector, Gilbert De\r\nLamatyr, Wyoming; Court of Appeals, Charles Mason, Madison. Of those\r\nselected, McKean and Hulburd had served two terms each in Congress.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1125: New York _World_, October 4, 1867.]\r\n\r\nThe platform no longer revealed differences in the party. It affirmed\r\nimpartial suffrage, protested against maladministration and corruption\r\nin State affairs, supported Congress in its policy of reconstruction,\r\nand rebuked all tampering with the financial obligations of the Union.\r\nUpon these plain, simple issues Conservatives and Radicals stood\r\nunited. Those who, in 1865, thought the restoration of the Union on\r\nthe President's plan would have been wise, conceded that under the\r\nchanged conditions in 1867 it would be impracticable as well as unsafe\r\nand impolitic. Indeed, in his conduct of the _Times_, Raymond was\r\nagain in accord with the Republicans, but he did not seek to renew his\r\nformer relations with the party. Being complimented for \"keeping in\r\nthe background,\"[1126] he replied that \"when, a year ago, he declined a\r\nre-election to Congress, it was for the purpose of devoting himself\r\nwholly to the editorship of the _Times_, a position more to his taste\r\nthan any other, and which carries with it as much of influence,\r\nhonour, and substantial reward as any office in the gift of Presidents\r\nor political parties.\"[1127] Had he appreciated the truth of this wise\r\nstatement in 1864 his sun might not have set in a cloud. \"His\r\nparliamentary failure,\" says Blaine, \"was a keen disappointment to\r\nhim, and was not improbably one among many causes which cut short a\r\nbrilliant and useful life.\"[1128]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1126: Buffalo _Commercial Advertiser_, September 25, 1867.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1127: New York _Times_, September 27, 1867.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1128: James G. Blaine, _Twenty Years of Congress_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n140.]\r\n\r\nThe passing of Raymond and the advent of John T. Hoffman as a factor\r\nin the State illustrate the curious work often wrought by political\r\nchanges. Raymond's efforts in behalf of reconciliation and peace\r\nhappened to concur in point of time with the demands of Tammany for\r\nHoffman and home-rule, and the latter proved the more potent.\r\n\r\nHoffman's appearance in State politics marked the beginning of a new\r\nera. The increased majority in New York City in 1866, so\r\ndisproportionate to other years, and the naturalisation of immigrants\r\nat the rate of one thousand a day, regardless of the period of their\r\nresidence in the country,[1129] indicated that a new leader of the\r\nfirst magnitude had appeared, and that methods which differentiated\r\nall moral principles had been introduced. For ten years William Marcy\r\nTweed had been sachem or grand sachem of Tammany and chairman of its\r\ngeneral committee. In climbing the ladder of power he had had his ups\r\nand downs. He endured several defeats, notably for assistant alderman,\r\nfor re-election to Congress after a service of one term, and for\r\nsheriff of New York County. But his popularity suffered no eclipse.\r\nEver since he led the ropes as a volunteer fireman, carrying a\r\nsilver-mounted trumpet, a white fire coat, and a stiff hat, the young\r\nmen of his class had made a hero of the tall, graceful, athletic\r\nchief. His smiles were winning and his manners magnetic. From leading\r\na fire company he quickly led the politics of his district and then of\r\nhis ward, utilising his popularity by becoming in 1859 a member of the\r\nBoard of Supervisors, and in 1863 deputy street commissioner. As\r\nsupervisor he influenced expenditures and the making of contracts,\r\nwhile the street deputy-ship gave him control of thousands of\r\nlabourers and sent aldermen after him for jobs for their ward\r\nsupporters. Thus intrenched he dropped chair-making, a business\r\ninherited from his father, put up the sign of lawyer, and became known\r\nto friends and foes as Boss Tweed, a title to which he did not object.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1129: Gustavus Myers, _History of Tammany Hall_, p. 250.]\r\n\r\nLike Hoffman, Tweed had a most agreeable personality. Always\r\nscrupulously neat in his dress and suave in manner, he possessed the\r\noutward characteristics of a gentleman, being neither boastful nor\r\nnoisy, and never addicted to the drink or tobacco habit. To his\r\nfriends the warmth of his greeting and the heartiness of his\r\nhand-shake evidenced the active sympathies expressed in numberless\r\ndeeds of kindness and charity. Yet he could be despotic. If he desired\r\na motion carried in his favour he neglected to call for negative\r\nvotes, warning opponents with significant glances of the danger of\r\nincurring his displeasure. Once, when his ruling as chairman of a\r\nTammany nominating convention raised a storm of protests, he blocked\r\nthe plans of his adversaries by adjourning the meeting and turning off\r\nthe gas.\r\n\r\nAlthough Tweed, perhaps, was often at fault in his estimate of men who\r\nfrequently deceived him, he selected his immediate lieutenants with\r\nintelligent care. In 1857 he had George G. Barnard elected recorder\r\nand Peter B. Sweeny district attorney. About the same time Richard B.\r\nConnolly became county clerk. When Barnard's term expired in 1860 he\r\nadvanced him to the Supreme Court and took up Hoffman for recorder.\r\nLater Hoffman became mayor and Connolly city comptroller. After\r\nHoffman's second promotion A. Oakey Hall was made mayor. In his way\r\neach of these men contributed strength to the political junta which\r\nwas destined to grow in influence and power until it seemed\r\ninvincible. Hall had been a versifier, a writer of tales in prose, a\r\nKnow-nothing, a friend of Seward, and an anti-Tammany Democrat. As a\r\nclubman, ambitious for social distinction, he was known as \"elegant\r\nOakey.\" Although \"without ballast,\" as Tweed admitted, he was\r\nindispensable as an interesting speaker of considerable force, who\r\nyielded readily to the demands of a boss. Connolly, suave and courtly,\r\nwas at heart so mean and crafty that Tweed himself held him in the\r\nutmost contempt as a \"Slippery Dick.\" But he was a good bookkeeper.\r\nBesides, however many leeches he harboured about him, his intimate\r\nknowledge of Tweed's doings kept him in power. Perhaps Barnard, more\r\nin the public eye than any other, had less legal learning than wit,\r\nyet in spite of his foppish dress he never lacked sufficient dignity\r\nto float the appearance of a learned judge. He was a handsome man,\r\ntall and well proportioned, with peculiarly brilliant eyes, a jet\r\nblack moustache, light olive complexion, and a graceful carriage.\r\nWhenever in trouble Tweed could safely turn to him without\r\ndisappointment. But the man upon whom the Boss most relied was Sweeny.\r\nHe was a great manipulator of men, acquiring the cognomen of Peter\r\nBrains Sweeny in recognition of his admitted ability. He had little\r\ntaste for public life. Nevertheless, hidden from sight, without\r\nconscience and without fear, his sly, patient intrigues surpassed\r\nthose of his great master. The _Tribune_ called him \"the\r\nMephistopheles of Tammany.\"[1130]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1130: New York _Tribune_, March 5, 1868.]\r\n\r\nThe questionable doings of some of these men had already attracted the\r\nattention of the press. It was not then known that a thirty-five per\r\ncent. rake-off on all bills paid by the city was divided between Tweed\r\nand Connolly, or that Sweeny had stolen enough to pay $60,000 for his\r\nconfirmation as city chamberlain by the Board of Aldermen;[1131] but\r\nthe prompt subscription of $175,000 by a few members of Tammany for\r\nthe erection of a new hall on Fourteenth Street, the cornerstone of\r\nwhich was laid on July 4, 1867, showed that some folks were rapidly\r\ngetting rich.[1132] In the year after Hoffman's defeat for governor the\r\naim of Tweed and his lieutenants was to carry city elections and\r\ncontrol State conventions, with dreams of making Hoffman governor and\r\nthen President, and of electing Tweed to the United States Senate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1131: Tweed's testimony, Document No. 8, p. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1132: Gustavus Myers, _History of Tammany Hall_, p. 257.]\r\n\r\nWith this ambitious scheme in view the Tammany braves, reaching Albany\r\non October 3, 1867, demanded that Hoffman be made president of the\r\nDemocratic State convention. It was a bold claim for a defeated\r\ncandidate. After Fenton's election in 1864 Seymour had deemed it\r\nproper to remain in the background, and for two years did not attend a\r\nState convention. He had now reappeared, and the up-State delegates,\r\ndelighted at his return, insisted upon his election as president.\r\nInstantly this became the issue. The friends of the Governor pointed\r\nto his achievements and to his distinguished position as the great\r\napostle of Democracy. On the other hand, Tammany, with its usual\r\nassurance, talked of its 50,000 majority given the Democratic ticket\r\nin 1866, declared that Seymour had had enough, and that Hoffman needed\r\nthe endorsement to secure his re-election as mayor in the following\r\nDecember. Thus the contest raged. Tammany was imperious and the\r\ncountry delegates stubborn. One year before these men had allowed\r\ntheir better judgment to be coerced into a condemnation of John A. Dix\r\nbecause of his alleged ill treatment of Democrats; but now, standing\r\nlike a stone wall for Seymour, they followed their convictions as to\r\nthe best interests of the party. In the end Hoffman became temporary\r\nchairman and Seymour president. The generous applause that greeted\r\nHoffman's appearance must have satisfied his most ardent friend until\r\nhe witnessed the spontaneous and effusive welcome accorded Seymour. If\r\nit was noisy, it was also hearty. It had the ring of real joy, mingled\r\nwith an admiration that is bestowed only upon a leader who captivates\r\nthe imagination by recalling glorious victory and exciting high hopes\r\nof future success.[1133]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1133: New York _World_, October 4, 1867.]\r\n\r\nThe selection of candidates provoked no real contests,[1134] but the\r\nplatform presented serious difficulties. The Democratic party\r\nthroughout the country found it hard to digest the war debt. Men who\r\nbelieved it had been multiplied by extravagance and corruption in the\r\nprosecution of an unholy war, thought it should be repudiated\r\noutright, while many others, especially in the Western States, would\r\npay it in the debased currency of the realm. To people whose\r\ncirculating medium before the war was mainly the bills of wild-cat\r\nbanks, greenbacks seemed like actual money and the best money they had\r\never known. It was attractive and everywhere of uniform value.\r\nMoreover, as the Government was behind it the necessity for gold and\r\nsilver no longer appealed to them. The popular policy, therefore,\r\nmade the 5-20 bonds payable in greenbacks instead of coin. Of the\r\nwhole interest-bearing debt of $2,200,000,000, there were outstanding\r\nabout $1,600,000,000 of 5-20's, or securities convertible into them,\r\nand of these $500,000,000 became redeemable in 1867. Their redemption\r\nin gold, worth from 132 to 150, it was argued, would not only be a\r\ndiscrimination in favour of the rich, but a foolish act of generosity,\r\nsince the law authorising the bonds stipulated that the interest\r\nshould be paid in \"coin\" and the principal in \"dollars.\" As greenbacks\r\nwere lawful money they were also \"dollars\" within the meaning of the\r\nlegal tender act, and although an inflation of the currency, made\r\nnecessary by the redemption of bonds, might increase the price of gold\r\nand thus amount to practical repudiation, it would in nowise modify\r\nthe law making the bonds payable in paper \"dollars.\" This was known as\r\nthe \"Ohio idea.\" It was a popular scheme with debtors, real estate\r\nowners, shopkeepers, and business men generally, who welcomed\r\ninflation as an antidote for the Secretary of the Treasury's\r\ncontraction of the currency. Democratic politicians accepted this\r\npolicy the more readily, too, because of the attractive cry--\"the same\r\ncurrency for the bondholder and the ploughboy.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1134: The following persons were nominated: Secretary of\r\nState, Homer A. Nelson, Dutchess; Comptroller, William F. Allen,\r\nOswego; Treasurer, Wheeler H. Bristol, Tioga; Attorney-General,\r\nMarshal B. Champlain, Allegany; State Engineer, Van R. Richmond,\r\nWayne; Canal Commissioner, John F. Fay, Monroe; Prison Inspector,\r\nNicholas B. Scheu, Erie; Court of Appeals, Martin Grover, Allegany.]\r\n\r\nThere was much of this sentiment in New York. Extreme Democrats,\r\ntaught that the debt was corruptly incurred, resented the suggestion\r\nof its payment in gold. \"Bloated bondholders\" became a famous\r\nexpression with them, to whom it seemed likely that the $700,000,000\r\nof United States notes, if inflated to an amount sufficient to pay the\r\nbonds, would ultimately force absolute repudiation. These views found\r\nready acceptance among delegates to the State convention, and to put\r\nhimself straight upon the record, John T. Hoffman, in his speech as\r\ntemporary chairman, boldly declared \"the honour of the country pledged\r\nto the payment of every dollar of the national debt, honestly and\r\nfully, in the spirit as well as in the letter of the bond.\"[1135]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1135: New York _World_, October 4, 1867.]\r\n\r\nSeymour, with his usual dexterity, declined to commit himself or his\r\nparty to any decided policy. Although he would \"keep the public\r\nfaith,\" and \"not add repudiation to the list of crimes which destroy\r\nconfidence in republican governments,\" his arguments shed no light on\r\nthe meaning of those words. He declared that \"waste and corruption had\r\npiled up the national debt,\" and that it was \"criminal folly to exempt\r\nbonds from taxation.\" Then, entering into a general discussion of\r\nfinance, he arraigned the war party for its extravagance, infidelity,\r\nand plundering policy. \"Those who hold the power,\" he said, \"have not\r\nonly hewed up to the line of repudiation, but they have not tried to\r\ngive value to the public credit. It is not the bondholder, it is the\r\noffice holder who sucks the blood of the people. If the money\r\ncollected by the government was paid to lessen our debt we could\r\ncommand the specie of the world. We could gain it in exchange for our\r\nsecurities as the governments of Europe do. Now, they are peddled out\r\nat half price in exchange for dry-goods and groceries. The reports of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury show that we could swiftly wipe out our\r\ndebt if our income was not diverted to partisan purposes. Do not the\r\ncolumns of the press teem with statements of official plunder and\r\nfrauds in every quarter of our land, while public virtue rots under\r\nthis wasteful expenditure of the public fund? It is said it is\r\nrepudiation to force our legal tenders upon the bondholders. What\r\nmakes it so? The low credit of the country. Build that up; make your\r\npaper as good as gold, and this question cannot come up. The\r\ncontroversy grows out of the fact that men do not believe our legal\r\ntenders ever will be as good as gold. If it is repudiation to pay such\r\nmoney, it is repudiation to make it, and it is repudiation to keep it\r\ndebased by waste and by partisan plans to keep our country in disorder\r\nand danger.\"[1136]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1136: New York _World_, October 4, 1867.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no American ever possessed a more irritating way of presenting\r\nthe frailties of an opposite party. The unwholesome sentiment of his\r\nTweddle Hall and draft-riot speeches, so shockingly out of key with\r\nthe music of the Union, provoked the charge of sinning against clear\r\nlight; but ordinarily he had such a faculty for skilfully blending\r\ntruth with hyperbole in a daring and spirited argument that Greeley,\r\nwho could usually expose the errors of an opponent's argument in a\r\ndozen sentences, found it woven too closely for hasty answer. On this\r\noccasion his speech compelled the committee on resolutions, after an\r\nall day and night session, to refer the matter to Samuel J. Tilden and\r\ntwo associates, who finally evaded the whole issue by declaring for\r\n\"equal taxation.\" This meant taxation of government bonds without\r\nspecification as to their payment. John McKeon of New York City\r\nattacked the words as \"equivocal\" and \"without moral effect,\" but the\r\ninfluence of Seymour and Tilden carried it with practical unanimity.\r\n\r\nThe power of Seymour, however, best exhibited itself in the treatment\r\naccorded Andrew Johnson. The conventions of 1865 and 1866 had\r\nsustained the President with energy and earnestness, endorsing his\r\npolicy, commending his integrity, and encouraging him to believe in\r\nthe sincerity of their support. In recognition Johnson had displaced\r\nRepublicans for Democrats until the men in office resembled the\r\nappointees of Buchanan's administration. The proceedings of the\r\nconvention of 1867, however, contained no evidence that the United\r\nStates had a Chief Executive. Nothing could have been more\r\nremorseless. The plan, silently matured, was suddenly and without\r\nscruple flashed upon the country that Andrew Johnson, divested of\r\nrespect, stripped of support, and plucked of offices, had been coolly\r\ndropped by the Democracy of the Empire State.\r\n\r\nThe campaign opened badly for the Republicans. Weighted with canal\r\nfrauds the party, with all its courage and genius, seemed unequal to\r\nthe odds against which it was forced to contend. The odious\r\ndisclosures showed that the most trifling technicalities, often only a\r\nmisspelled or an interlined word, and in one instance, at least,\r\nsimply an ink blot, had been held sufficient to vacate the lowest\r\nbids, the contracts afterward being assigned to other bidders at\r\nlargely increased amounts. So insignificant were these informalities\r\nthat in many cases the official who declared the bids irregular could\r\nnot tell upon the witness stand wherein they were so, although he\r\nadmitted that in no instance did the State benefit by the change.\r\nIndeed, without cunning or reason, the plunderers, embracing all who\r\nmade or paid canal accounts, declared bids informal that contracts at\r\nincreased prices might be given to members of a ring who divided their\r\nill-gotten gains. These increases ranged from $1,000 to $100,000 each,\r\naggregating a loss to the State of many hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars. \"The corruption is so enormous,\" said the _World_, \"as to\r\nrender absurd any attempt at concealment.\"[1137]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1137: New York _World_, September 27, 1867.\r\n\r\nThe story of these frauds is found in two volumes of testimony\r\nsubmitted by the Canal Investigation Committee to the Constitutional\r\nConvention of 1867.]\r\n\r\nRepublicans offered no defence except that their party, having had the\r\ncourage to investigate and expose the frauds and the methods of the\r\npeculators, could be trusted to continue the reform. To this the\r\n_World_ replied that \"a convention of shoddyites might, with as good a\r\nface, have lamented the rags hanging about the limbs of our shivering\r\nsoldiers, or a convention of whisky thieves affect to deplore the\r\nfalling off of the internal revenue.\"[1138] Moreover, Democrats claimed\r\nthat the worst offender was still in office as an appointee of\r\nGovernor Fenton,[1139] and that the Republican nominee for canal\r\ncommissioner had been guilty of similar transactions when\r\nsuperintendent of one of the waterways.[1140] These charges became the\r\nmore glaring because Republicans refused to renominate senators who\r\nhad been chiefly instrumental in exposing the frauds. \"They take great\r\ncredit to themselves for having found out this corruption in the\r\nmanagement of the canals,\" said Seymour. \"But how did they exhibit\r\ntheir hatred of corruption? Were the men who made these exposures\r\nrenominated? Not by the Republicans. One of them is running upon our\r\nticket.\"[1141] On another occasion he declared that \"not one of the\r\npublic officers who are charged and convicted by their own friends of\r\nfraud and robbery have ever been brought to the bar of justice.\"[1142]\r\nThe severity of such statements lost none of its sting by the\r\ndeclaration of Horace Greeley, made over his own signature, that\r\nRepublican candidates were \"conspicuous for integrity and for\r\nresistance to official corruption.\"[1143]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1138: New York _World_, September 27, 1867.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1139: _Ibid._, October 16, 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1140: _Ibid._, October 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1141: _New York World_, October 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1142: _Ibid._, October 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1143: New York _Tribune_, September 26, 1867.]\r\n\r\nThe practical failure of the constitutional convention to accomplish\r\nthe purpose for which it assembled also embarrassed Republicans. By\r\nthe terms of the Constitution of 1846 the Legislature was required, in\r\neach twentieth year thereafter, to submit to the people the question\r\nof convening a convention for its revision, and in 1866, an\r\naffirmative answer being given, such a convention began its work at\r\nAlbany on June 4, 1867. Of the one hundred and sixty delegates,\r\nninety-seven were Republicans. Its membership included many men of the\r\nhighest capacity, whose debates, characterised by good temper and\r\nforensic ability, showed an intelligent knowledge of the needs of the\r\nState. Their work included the payment of the canal and other State\r\ndebts, extended the term of senators from two to four years, increased\r\nthe members of the Assembly, conferred the right of suffrage without\r\ndistinction of colour, reorganised the Court of Appeals with a chief\r\njustice and six associate justices, and increased the tenure of\r\nsupreme and appellate judges to fourteen years, with an age limit of\r\nseventy.\r\n\r\nVery early in the life of the convention, however, the press, largely\r\ninfluenced by the New York _Tribune_, began to discredit its work.\r\nHorace Greeley, who was a member, talked often and always well, but\r\nthe more he talked the more he revealed his incapacity for safe\r\nleadership. He seemed to grow restive as he did in Congress over\r\nimmaterial matters. Long speeches annoyed him, and adjournments from\r\nFriday to the following Tuesday sorely vexed him, although this\r\narrangement convenienced men of large business interests. Besides,\r\ncommittees not being ready to report, there was little to occupy the\r\ntime of delegates. Nevertheless, Greeley, accustomed to work without\r\nlimit as to hours or thought of rest, insisted that the convention\r\nought to keep busy six days in the week and finish the revision for\r\nwhich it assembled. When his power to influence colleagues had\r\nentirely disappeared, he began using the _Tribune_, whose acrid\r\narguments, accepted by the lesser newspapers, completely undermined\r\nall achievement. Finally, on September 24, the convention recessed\r\nuntil November 12.\r\n\r\nDemocrats charged at once that the adjournment was a skulking\r\nsubterfuge not only to avoid an open confession of failure, but to\r\nevade submitting negro suffrage to a vote in November. The truth of\r\nthe assertion seemed manifest. At all events, it proved a most serious\r\nhandicap to Republicans, who, by an act of Congress, passed on March\r\n2, 1867, had forced negro suffrage upon the Southern States. Their\r\nplatform, adopted at Syracuse, also affirmed it. Moreover, their\r\nabsolute control of the constitutional convention enabled them, if\r\nthey had so desired, to finish and submit their work in the early\r\nautumn. This action subjected their convention resolve for \"impartial\r\nsuffrage\" to ridicule as well as to the charge of cowardice. If you\r\nshrink from giving the ballot to a few thousand negroes at home, it\r\nwas asked, why do you insist that it should be conferred on millions\r\nin the South? If, as you pretend, you wish the blacks of this State to\r\nhave the ballot, why do you not give it to them? How can you blame the\r\nSouth for hesitating when you hesitate? \"It is manifest,\" said the\r\n_World_, \"that the Republicans do not desire the negroes of this State\r\nto vote. Their refusal to present the question in this election is a\r\nconfession that the party is forcing on the South a measure too\r\nodious to be tolerated at home.\"[1144]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1144: New York _World_, September 27, 1867.]\r\n\r\nThis charge, perhaps, was the most disturbing influence Republicans\r\nhad to meet in the campaign. Responsibility for canal frauds made them\r\nwince, since it appealed strongly and naturally to whatever there was\r\nof discontent among the people, but their apparent readiness to force\r\nupon the South what they withheld in New York seemed so unreasonable\r\nand unjust that it aided materially in swelling the strength of the\r\nDemocrats.\r\n\r\nJames T. Brady, Henry C. Murphy, John T. Hoffman, and Samuel J. Tilden\r\nmade the campaign attractive, speaking with unsparing severity to the\r\ngreat audiences gathered in New York City. Although somewhat\r\ncapricious in his sympathies, Brady seemed never to care who knew what\r\nhe thought on any subject, while the people, captivated by his\r\nmarvellously easy mode of speech, listened with rapture as he\r\nexercised his splendid powers. It remained for Seymour, however, to\r\ngive character to the discussion in one of his most forcible\r\nphilippics. He endeavoured to show that the ballot, given to a few\r\nnegroes in New York, could do little harm compared to the\r\nenfranchisement of millions of them in the Southern States. The\r\nRadicals, he said, not only propose to put the white men of the South\r\nunder the blacks, but the white men of the North as well. To allow\r\nthree millions of negroes, representing ten Southern States, to send\r\ntwenty senators to Washington, while more than half the white\r\npopulation of the country, living in nine Northern States, have but\r\neighteen senators, is a home question. \"Will you sanction it?\" he\r\nasked. \"Twenty senators, recollect, who are to act in relation to\r\ninterests deeply affecting you. Can you afford to erect such a\r\ngovernment of blacks over the white men of this continent? Will you\r\ngive them control in the United States Senate and thus in fact\r\ndisfranchise the North? This to you is a local question. It will\r\nsearch you out just as surely as the tax-gatherer searches you\r\nout.\"[1145]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1145: New York _World_, October 25, 1867.]\r\n\r\nRepublicans acknowledged their weakness. An opposition that invited\r\nattention to disclosures as sensational and corrupt as they were\r\nindefensible had deeper roots than ordinary political rivalry, while\r\nthe question of manhood suffrage, like a legacy of reciprocal hate,\r\naroused the smouldering prejudices that had found bitter expression\r\nduring the discussion of emancipation. Moreover, the feeling developed\r\nthat the narrow and unpatriotic policy which ruled the Syracuse\r\nconvention had displaced good men for unsatisfactory candidates. This\r\nled to the substitution of Thomas H. Hillhouse for comptroller, whose\r\nincorruptibility made him a candidate of unusual strength. But the\r\nsacrifice did not change the political situation, aggravated among\r\nother things by hard times. The wave of commercial depression which\r\nspread over Europe after the London financial panic of May, 1866,\r\nextended to this country during the last half of 1867. A reaction from\r\nthe inflated war prices took place, quick sales and large profits\r\nceased, and a return to the old methods of frugality and good\r\nmanagement became necessary. In less than two years the currency had\r\nbeen contracted $140,000,000, decreasing the price of property and\r\nenhancing the face value of debts, and although Congress, in the\r\npreceding February, had suspended further contraction, business men\r\ncharged financial conditions to contraction and the people held the\r\nparty in power responsible.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the people had become tired of Republican rule, and their\r\nverdict changed a plurality of 13,000, given Fenton in 1866, to a\r\nDemocratic majority of nearly 48,000, with twenty-two majority on\r\njoint ballot in the Legislature. New York City gave the Democrats\r\n60,000 majority. Thousands of immigrants had been illegally\r\nnaturalised, and a fraudulent registration of 1,500 in one ward\r\nindicated the extent of the enormous frauds that had been practised by\r\nBoss Tweed and his gang;[1146] but the presence of large Democratic\r\ngains in the up-State counties showed that Republican defeat was due\r\nto other causes than fraudulent registration and illegal voting.\r\n\"Outside the incapables and their miserable subalterns who managed the\r\nSyracuse convention,\" said one Republican paper, \"a pervading\r\nsentiment existed among us, not only that we should be beaten, but\r\nthat we needed chastisement.\"[1147] Another placed the responsibility\r\nupon \"a host of political adventurers, attracted to the party by\r\nselfish aggrandisements.\"[1148] The _Tribune_ accepted it as a\r\npunishment for cowardice on the negro suffrage question. \"To say that\r\nwe are for manhood suffrage in the South and not in the North is to\r\nearn the loathing, contempt, and derision alike of friends and\r\nfoes.\"[1149] Thus had Republican power disappeared like Aladdin's\r\npalace, which was ablaze with splendour at night, and could not be\r\nseen in the morning.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1146: Gustavus Myers, _History of Tammany Hall_, p. 250.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1147: Buffalo _Commercial Advertiser_, November 6, 1867.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1148: Albany _Evening Journal_, November 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1149: New York _Tribune_, November 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSEYMOUR AND HOFFMAN\r\n\r\n1868\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall elections of 1867 made a profound impression in the Empire\r\nState. Pennsylvania gave a small Democratic majority, Ohio defeated a\r\nnegro suffrage amendment by 50,000, besides electing a Democratic\r\nlegislature, and New York, leading the Democratic column, surprised\r\nthe nation with a majority of nearly 48,000. In every county the\r\nRepublican vote had fallen off. It was plain that reconstruction and\r\nnegro suffrage had seriously disgruntled the country. The policy of\r\nthe Republicans, therefore, which had hitherto been one of delay in\r\nadmitting Southern States to representation in Congress, now changed\r\nto one of haste to get them in, the party believing that with negro\r\nenfranchisement and white disfranchisement it could control the South.\r\nThis sudden change had alarmed conservatives of all parties, and the\r\nDemocratic strength shown at the preceding election encouraged the\r\nbelief that the radical work of Congress might be overthrown. \"The\r\ndanger now is,\" wrote John Sherman, \"that the mistakes of the\r\nRepublicans may drift the Democratic party into power.\"[1150]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1150: Sherman's Letters, p. 299.]\r\n\r\nThe action of Congress after the removal of Edwin M. Stanton, then\r\nsecretary of war, did not weaken this prediction. The Senate had\r\nalready refused its assent to the Secretary's suspension, and when the\r\nPresident, exercising what he believed to be his constitutional power,\r\nappointed Adjutant-General Thomas in his place, it brought the contest\r\nto a crisis. Stanton, barricaded in the War Office, refused to leave,\r\nwhile Thomas, bolder in talk than in deeds, threatened to kick him\r\nout.[1151] In support of Stanton a company of one hundred men, mustered\r\nby John A. Logan, a member of Congress, occupied the basement of the\r\nWar Department. Not since the assassination of Lincoln had the country\r\nbeen in such a state of excitement. Meanwhile former propositions of\r\nimpeachment were revived, and although without evidence of guilty\r\nintent, the House, on February 14, resolved that Andrew Johnson be\r\nimpeached of high crimes and misdemeanours. This trial, which\r\ncontinued for nearly three months, kept the country flushed with\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1151: _Impeachment Trial_, Vol. 1, p. 223.]\r\n\r\nNew York Democrats greatly enjoyed the situation. To them it meant a\r\ndivision of the Republican party vastly more damaging than the one in\r\n1866. Opposition to Grant's candidacy also threatened to widen the\r\nbreach. The Conservatives, led by Thurlow Weed, wishing to break the\r\nintolerant control of the Radicals by securing a candidate free from\r\nfactional bias, had pronounced for the Soldier's nomination for\r\nPresident as early as July, 1867,[1152] and although the current of\r\nRepublican journalism as well as the drift of party sentiment tended\r\nto encourage the movement, the Radicals opposed it. Grant's report on\r\nthe condition of the South in 1865, and his attendance upon the\r\nPresident in 1866 during the famous swing-around-the-circle, had\r\nprovoked much criticism. Besides, his acceptance of the War Office\r\nafter Stanton's suspension indicated marked confidence in the Chief\r\nExecutive. Indeed, so displeasing had been his record since the close\r\nof the war that the _Tribune_ ridiculed his pretensions, predicting\r\nthat if any man of his type of politics was elected it would be by the\r\nDemocrats.[1153] Even after the loss of the elections the _Tribune_\r\ncontinued its opposition. \"We object to the Grant movement,\" it said.\r\n\"It is of the ostrich's simple strategy that deceives only himself.\r\nThere are times in which personal preference and personal popularity\r\ngo far; but they are not these times. Does any one imagine that\r\nGeneral Grant, supported by the Republicans, would carry Maryland or\r\nKentucky, under her present Constitution, against Seymour or\r\nPendleton?\"[1154] Many agreed with Greeley. Indeed, a majority of the\r\nRadicals, deeming Grant unsound on reconstruction and the negro,\r\npreferred Chief Justice Chase.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1152: New York _World_, July 25, 1867.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1153: New York _Tribune_, October 15, 1867.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1154: New York _Tribune_, November 7, 1867.]\r\n\r\nVery unexpectedly, however, conditions changed. Stanton's suspension\r\nin August, 1867, led to Grant's appointment as secretary of war, but\r\nwhen the Senate, early in the following January, refused to concur in\r\nJohnson's action, Grant locked the door of the War Office and resumed\r\nhis post at army headquarters. The President expressed surprise that\r\nhe did not hold the office until the question of Stanton's\r\nconstitutional right to resume it could be judicially determined. This\r\ncriticism, delivered in Johnson's positive style, provoked a long and\r\nheated controversy, involving the veracity of each and leaving them\r\nenemies for life. The quarrel delighted the Radicals. It put Grant\r\ninto sympathy with Congress, and Republicans into sympathy with Grant.\r\nUntil then it was not clear to what party he belonged. Before the war\r\nhe acted with the Democrats, and very recently the successors of the\r\nold Albany Regency had been quietly preparing for his nomination.[1155]\r\nNow, however, he was in cordial relation with Republicans, whose\r\nconvention, held at Syracuse on February 5, 1868, to select delegates\r\nto the National convention, indorsed his candidacy by acclamation. The\r\nConservatives welcomed this action as their victory. Moreover, it was\r\nthe first formal expression of a State convention. Republicans of\r\nother Commonwealths had indicated their readiness to accept Grant as a\r\ncandidate, but New York, endorsing him before the termination of his\r\ncontroversy with the President, anticipated their action and set the\r\nparty aflame. Indeed, it looked to Republicans as if this nomination\r\nassured success at a moment when their chances had seemed hopeless.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1155: T.W. Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 458.]\r\n\r\nIn like manner the convention recommended Reuben E. Fenton for\r\nVice-President. Fenton had made an acceptable governor. Under his\r\nadministration projects for lengthening the locks on the Erie Canal\r\nand other plans for extending the facilities of transportation were\r\npresented. Another memorable work was the establishment of Cornell\r\nUniversity, which has aptly been called \"the youngest, the largest,\r\nand the richest\" of the nearly thirty colleges in the State. Even the\r\n_Times_, the great organ of the Conservatives, admitted that the\r\nGovernor's \"executive control, in the main, has been a success.\"[1156]\r\nOpposition to his promotion, however, presented well-defined lines. To\r\nThurlow Weed he represented the mismanagement which defeated the\r\nparty,[1157] and to Conkling he appealed only as one on whom to employ\r\nwith effect, when occasion offered, his remarkable resources of\r\nsarcasm and rhetoric. The Governor understood this feeling, and to\r\navoid its influence delegates were instructed to vote for him as a\r\nunit, while three hundred devoted friends went to Chicago. Daniel E.\r\nSickles became chairman of the delegation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1156: New York _Times_, February 4, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1157: T.W. Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 459.]\r\n\r\nThe Republican convention convened at Chicago on May 20, and amidst\r\nthroat-bursting cheers and salvos of artillery Ulysses S. Grant was\r\nnominated for President by acclamation. For Vice-President a dozen\r\ncandidates were presented, including Henry Wilson of Massachusetts,\r\nReuben E. Fenton of New York, Benjamin Wade of Ohio, and Schuyler\r\nColfax of Indiana. Fenton's friends, finding the Northern States\r\npre-empted by other candidates, turned to the South, hoping to benefit\r\nas Wade's strength receded. Here, however, it was manifest that Wilson\r\nwould become the Buckeye's residuary legatee. Fenton also suffered\r\nfrom the over-zeal of friends. In seconding his nomination an Illinois\r\ndelegate encountered John A. Logan, who coolly remarked that Fenton\r\nwould get three votes and no more from his State. To recover prestige\r\nafter this blow Daniel E. Sickles, in a brief speech, deftly included\r\nhim with Morton of Indiana, Curtin of Pennsylvania, Andrew of\r\nMassachusetts, and other great war governors. In this company Fenton,\r\nwho had served less than four months at the close of the war, seemed\r\nout of place, and Sickles resumed his seat undisturbed by any\r\ndemonstration except by the faithful three hundred.[1158] Fenton's\r\nvote, however, was more pronounced than the applause, although his\r\nstrength outside of New York came largely from the South, showing that\r\nhis popularity centred in a section whose representatives in National\r\nRepublican conventions have too often succumbed to influences other\r\nthan arguments.[1159]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1158: _Official Proceedings of the Convention_, p. 96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1159: BALLOTS\r\n\r\n                   1     2     3     4     5     6\r\nWade              147   170   178   206   207    38\r\nColfax            115   145   165   186   226   541\r\nFenton            126   144   139   144   139    69\r\nWilson            119   114   101    87    56\r\nHamlin             28    30    25    25    20\r\nCurtin             51    45    40\r\n\r\nOutside of New York Fenton's vote was as follows:\r\n\r\nNorthern States    23    33    32    32    31     2\r\nSouthern States    44    45    42    48    61     1]\r\n\r\nThe echo of Fenton's defeat seriously disturbed the Syracuse State\r\nconvention (July 8). The Conservatives of New York City, many of whom\r\nhad now become the followers of Conkling, objected to the Fenton\r\nmethod of selecting delegates, and after a bitter discussion between\r\nMatthew Hale of Albany and Charles S. Spencer, the Governor's ardent\r\nfriend, the convention limited the number of delegates from a city\r\ndistrict to the Republican vote actually cast, and appointed a\r\ncommittee to investigate the quarrel, with instructions to report at\r\nthe next State convention.\r\n\r\nThe selection of a candidate for governor also unsettled the\r\nRepublican mind. Friends of Lyman Tremaine, Charles H. Van Wyck,\r\nFrederick A. Conkling (a brother of the Senator), Stewart L. Woodford,\r\nand John A. Griswold had not neglected to put their favourites into\r\nthe field at an early day, but to all appearances Horace Greeley was\r\nthe popular man among the delegates. Although Conkling had snuffed out\r\nhis senatorial ambition, he had been the directing power of the\r\nFebruary convention, and was still the recognised guide-post of the\r\nparty. Besides, the withdrawal of Tremaine, Van Wyck, and Conkling\r\npractically narrowed the rivalry to Greeley and Griswold. Indeed, it\r\nseemed as if the ambition of the editor's life was at last to be\r\nsatisfied. Weed was in Europe, Raymond still rested \"outside the\r\nbreastworks,\" and the Twenty-third Street organisation, as the\r\nConservatives were called, sat on back seats without votes and without\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nGreeley did not go to Syracuse. But his personal friends appeared in\r\nforce, led by Reuben E. Fenton, who controlled the State convention.\r\nGreeley believed the Governor sincerely desired his nomination.\r\nPerhaps he was also deceived in the strength of John A. Griswold. The\r\npeople, regarding Griswold's change from McClellan to Lincoln as a\r\npolitical emancipation, had doubled his majority for Congress in 1864\r\nand again in 1866. The poor loved him, the workmen admired him, and\r\nbusiness men backed him. Though but forty-six years old he had already\r\nmade his existence memorable. In their emphasis orators expressed no\r\nfear that the fierce white light which beats upon an aspirant for high\r\noffice would disclose in him poor judgment, or any weakness of\r\ncharacter. To these optimistic speeches delegates evinced a\r\nresponsiveness that cheered his friends.\r\n\r\nBut the real noise of the day did not commence until Chauncey M. Depew\r\nbegan his eulogy of the great editor. The applause then came in drifts\r\nof cheers as appreciative expressions fell from the lips of his\r\nchampion. It was admitted that Depew's speech adorned the day's\r\nwork.[1160] He referred to Greeley as \"the embodiment of the principles\r\nof his party,\" \"the one man towering above all others in intellect,\"\r\nwho \"has contributed more than any other man toward the\r\nenfranchisement of the slaves,\" and \"with his pen and his tongue has\r\ndone more for the advancement of the industrial classes.\" In\r\nconclusion, said the speaker, \"he belongs to no county, to no\r\nlocality; he belongs to the State and to the whole country, because of\r\nthe superiority of his intellect and the purity of his patriotism.\"[1161]\r\nAs the speaker finished, the applause, lasting \"many minutes,\"[1162]\r\nfinally broke into several rounds of cheers, while friends of Griswold\r\nas well as those of Greeley, standing on chairs, swung hats and\r\numbrellas after the fashion of a modern convention. Surely, Horace\r\nGreeley was the favourite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1160: New York _Tribune_, July 9, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1161: New York _Tribune_, July 9, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1162: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThe roll-call, however, gave Griswold 247, Greeley 95, Woodford 36.\r\nFor the moment Greeley's friends seemed stunned. It was worse than a\r\ndefeat--it was utter rout and confusion. He had been led into an\r\nambuscade and slaughtered. The _Tribune_, in explaining the affair,\r\nsaid \"it was evident in the morning that Griswold would get the\r\nnomination. His friends had been working so long and there were so\r\nmany outstanding pledges.\" Besides, it continued, \"when the fact\r\ndeveloped that he had a majority, it added to his strength\r\nafterward.\"[1163] Why, then, it was asked, did Greeley's friends put\r\nhim into a contest already settled? Did they wish to humiliate him?\r\n\"Had Greeley been here in person,\" said the _Times_, with apparent\r\nsympathy, \"the result might have been different.\"[1164] The _Nation_\r\nthought otherwise. \"In public,\" it said, \"few members of conventions\r\nhave the courage to deny his fitness for any office, such are the\r\nterrors inspired by his editorial cowskin; but the minute the voting\r\nby ballots begins, the cowardly fellows repudiate him under the veil\r\nof secrecy.\"[1165] The great disparity between the applause and the\r\nvote for the editor became the subject of much suppressed amusement.\r\n\"The highly wrought eulogium pronounced by Depew was applauded to the\r\necho,\" wrote a correspondent of the _Times_, \"but the enthusiasm\r\nsubsided wonderfully when it came to putting him at the head of the\r\nticket.\"[1166] Depew himself appreciated the humour of the situation.\r\n\"Everybody wondered,\" said the eulogist, speaking of it in later\r\nyears, \"how there could be so much smoke and so little fire.\"[1167] To\r\nthose conversant with the situation, however, it was not a mystery.\r\nAmong conservative men Greeley suffered discredit because of his\r\nill-tempered criticisms, while his action in signing Jefferson Davis's\r\nbail-bond was not the least powerful of the many influences that\r\ncombined to weaken his authority. It seemed to shatter confidence in\r\nhis strength of mind. After that episode the sale of his _American\r\nConflict_ which had reached the rate of five hundred copies a day,\r\nfell off so rapidly that his publishers lost $50,000.[1168]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1163: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1164: New York _Times_, July 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1165: The _Nation_, July 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1166: New York _Times_, July 9, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1167: Conversation with the author.\r\n\r\nThe ticket nominated was as follows: Governor, John A. Griswold,\r\nRensselaer; Lieutenant-Governor, Alonzo B. Cornell, Wyoming; Canal\r\nCommissioner, Alexander Barkley, Washington; Prison Inspector, Henry\r\nA. Barnum, Onondaga.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1168: _The Nation_, November 11, 1869.]\r\n\r\nThe platform approved the nomination of Grant and Colfax, held\r\ninviolate the payment of the public debt in the spirit as well as the\r\nletter of the law, commended the administration of Fenton, and\r\ndemanded absolute honesty in the management and improvement of the\r\ncanals; but adopting \"the simple tactics of the ostrich\" it maintained\r\nthe most profound silence in regard to suffrage of any kind--manhood,\r\nuniversal, impartial, or negro.[1169]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1169: New York _Tribune_, July 9, 1868.]\r\n\r\nThe day the Syracuse convention avoided Greeley, the National\r\nDemocratic convention which had assembled in Tammany's new building on\r\nJuly 4, accepted a leader under whom victory was impossible. It was an\r\nhistoric gathering. The West sent able leaders to support its\r\nfavourite greenback theory, the South's delegation of Confederate\r\nofficers recalled the picturesque scenes at Philadelphia in 1866, and\r\nNew England and the Middle States furnished a strong array of their\r\nwell-known men. Samuel J. Tilden headed the New York delegation,\r\nHoratio Seymour became permanent president, and in one of the chairs\r\nset apart for vice presidents, William M. Tweed, \"fat, oily, and\r\ndripping with the public wealth,\"[1170] represented the Empire State.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1170: New York _Tribune_, March 5, 1868.]\r\n\r\nThe chairmanship of the committee on resolutions fell to Henry C.\r\nMurphy of Brooklyn. Murphy was a brave fighter. In 1832, when barely\r\nin his twenties, he had denounced the policy of chartering banks in\r\nthe interest of political favourites and monopolists, and the reform,\r\nsoon after established, made him bold to attack other obnoxious fiscal\r\nsystems. As mayor of Brooklyn he kept the city's expenditures within\r\nits income, and in the constitutional convention of 1846 he stood with\r\nMichael Hoffman in preserving the public credit and the public faith.\r\nTo him who understood the spirit of the Legal Tender Act of 1862, it\r\nseemed rank dishonesty to pay bonds in a depreciated currency, and he\r\nsaid so in language that did not die in the committee room. But\r\nopposed to him were the extremists who controlled the convention.\r\nThese Greenbackers demanded \"that all obligations of the government,\r\nnot payable by their express terms in coin, ought to be paid in lawful\r\nmoney,\" and through them the Ohio heresy became the ruling thought of\r\nthe Democratic creed.\r\n\r\nAlthough New York consented to the Pendleton platform, it determined\r\nnot to sacrifice everything to the one question of finance by\r\npermitting the nomination of the Ohio statesman. There were other\r\ncandidates. Andrew Johnson was deluded into the belief that he had a\r\nchance; Winfield S. Hancock, the hero of the famous Second Army Corps,\r\nwho had put himself in training while department commander at New\r\nOrleans, believed in his star; Salmon P. Chase, chief justice of the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court, having failed to capture the nomination\r\nat Chicago, was willing to lead whenever and by whomsoever called;\r\nwhile Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana, then a United States senator\r\nand supporter of the \"Ohio idea,\" hoped to succeed if Pendleton\r\nfailed. Of these candidates Seymour favoured Chase. If nominated, he\r\nsaid, the Chief Justice would disintegrate the Republican party, carry\r\nCongress, and by uniting conservative Republicans and Democrats secure\r\na majority of the Senate. It was known that the sentiments of Chase\r\nharmonised with those of Eastern Democrats except as to negro\r\nsuffrage, and although on this issue the Chief Justice declined to\r\nyield, Seymour did not regard it of sufficient importance to quarrel\r\nabout. Indeed, it was said that Seymour had approved a platform,\r\nsubmitted to Chase by Democratic progressionists, which accepted negro\r\nsuffrage.[1171]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1171: New York _Times_, September 4, 1868.]\r\n\r\nSamuel J. Tilden, appreciating the importance of defeating Pendleton,\r\nat once directed all the resources of a cold, calculating nature to a\r\nsolution of the difficult problem. To mask his real purpose he pressed\r\nthe name of Sanford E. Church until the eighth ballot, when he\r\nadroitly dropped it for Hendricks. It was a bold move. The Hoosier was\r\nnot less offensive than the Buckeye, but it served Tilden's purpose to\r\ndissemble, and, as he apprehended, Hendricks immediately took the\r\nvotes of his own and other States from the Ohioan. This proved the end\r\nof Pendleton, whose vote thenceforth steadily declined. On the\r\nthirteenth ballot California cast half a vote for Chase, throwing the\r\nconvention into wild applause. For the moment it looked as if the\r\nChief Justice, still in intimate correspondence with influential\r\ndelegates, might capture the nomination. Vallandigham, who preferred\r\nChase to Hendricks, begged Tilden to cast New York's vote for him, but\r\nthe man of sheer intellect was not yet ready to show his hand.\r\nMeanwhile Hancock divided with Hendricks the lost strength of\r\nPendleton. Amidst applause from Tammany, Nebraska, on the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth ballots, cast three votes for John T. Hoffman. This\r\nclosed the fourth day of the convention, the eighteenth ballot\r\nregistering 144-1/2 votes for Hancock, 87 for Hendricks, 56-1/2 for\r\nPendleton, and 28 scattering.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fifth and last day, the New York delegation,\r\nbefore entering the convention, decided by a vote of 37 to 24 to\r\nsupport Chase provided Hendricks could not be nominated. Seymour\r\nfavoured the Chief Justice in an elaborate speech, which he intended\r\ndelivering on the floor of the convention, and for this purpose had\r\narranged with a delegate from Missouri to occupy the chair. It was\r\nknown, too, that Chase's strength had increased in other delegations.\r\nEleven Ohio delegates favoured him as their second choice, while\r\nMaine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Georgia, and Wisconsin could be\r\ndepended upon. Indeed, it was in the air that the Chief Justice would\r\nbe nominated. When the convention opened, however, a letter several\r\ndays old was read from Pendleton withdrawing from the contest. This\r\nquickly pushed Hendricks to 107. On the twenty-first ballot he rose to\r\n132 and Hancock fell off to 135-1/2, while four votes for Chase, given\r\nby Massachusetts, called out hisses[1172] as well as applause,\r\nindicating that the ambitious Justice was not entirely _persona grata_\r\nto all of the Westerners. To the confused delegates, worn out with\r\nloss of sleep and the intense heat, the situation did not excite hopes\r\nof an early settlement. New York could not name Chase since\r\nPendleton's withdrawal had strengthened Hendricks, while the\r\nnomination of a conservative Union soldier like Hancock, so soon after\r\nthe close of the war, would inevitably exasperate the more radical\r\nelement of the party. Thus it looked as if the motion to adjourn to\r\nmeet at St. Louis in September presented the only escape. Pending a\r\nroll-call, however, this motion was declared out of order, and the\r\nvoting continued until the Ohio delegation, having returned from a\r\nconference, boldly proposed the name of Horatio Seymour. The\r\ndelegates, hushed into silence by the dominating desire to verify\r\nrumours of an impending change, now gave vent to long, excited\r\ncheering. \"The folks were frantic,\" said an eye-witness; \"the delegates\r\ndaft. All other enthusiasms were as babbling brooks to the eternal\r\nthunder of Niagara. The whole mass was given over to acclaims that\r\ncannot even be suggested in print.\"[1173]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1172: New York _World_, July 10, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1173: New York _World_, July 10, 1868.]\r\n\r\nSeymour had positively declined a score of times. As early as\r\nNovember, 1867, after the Democratic victories of that month, he had\r\naddressed a letter to the _Union_, a Democratic paper of Oneida,\r\nstating that for personal reasons which he need not give, he was not\r\nand could not be a candidate. Other letters of similar purport had\r\nfrequently appeared in the press. To an intimate friend he spoke of\r\nfamily griefs, domestic troubles, impaired health, and the\r\nimpossibility of an election. Besides, if chosen, he said, he would be\r\nas powerless as Johnson, a situation that \"would put him in his grave\r\nin less than a year.\"[1174] In the whole convention there was not a man\r\nwho could truthfully say that the Governor, by look, or gesture, or\r\ninflection of voice, had encouraged the hope of a change of mind.\r\nWithin forty-eight hours every Democrat of influence had sounded him\r\nand gone away sorrowful. Now, when order was restored, he declined\r\nagain. His expressions of gratitude seemed only to make the\r\ndeclaration stronger. \"I do not stand here,\" he said, \"as a man proud\r\nof his opinion or obstinate in his purposes, but upon a question of\r\nduty and of honour I must stand upon my own convictions against the\r\nworld. When I said here, at an early day, that honour forbade my\r\naccepting a nomination, I meant it. When I said to my friends I could\r\nnot be a candidate, I meant it. And now, after all that has taken\r\nplace here, I could not receive the nomination without placing myself\r\nin a false position. Gentlemen, I thank you for your kindness, but\r\nyour candidate I cannot be.\"[1175]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1174: New York _Times_, Sept. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1175: New York _World_, July 10.]\r\n\r\nVallandigham replied that in times of great public exigency personal\r\nconsideration should yield to the public good, and Francis Kernan,\r\ndisclaiming any lot or part in Ohio's motion, declared that others\r\nthan the New York delegation must overcome the sensitiveness of the\r\nchairman. Still, he said, Horatio Seymour ought to abide the action of\r\nthe convention. These speeches over, the roll-call monotonously\r\ncontinued, each State voting as before until Wisconsin changed from\r\nDoolittle to Seymour. In an instant the chairman of each State\r\ndelegation, jumping to his feet, changed its vote to the New Yorker.\r\nThe pandemonium was greater than before, in the midst of which\r\nSeymour, apparently overwhelmed by the outcome, retired to a committee\r\nroom, where Church, Joseph Warren of the Buffalo _Courier_, and other\r\nfriends urged him to yield to the demands of the Democracy of the\r\ncountry. He was deeply affected. Tears filled his eyes, and he\r\npiteously sought the sympathy of friends.[1176] Soon after he left the\r\nbuilding. Meanwhile Tilden rose to change the vote of the Empire State\r\nfrom Hendricks to Seymour. \"It is fit on this occasion,\" he said,\r\n\"that New York should wait for the voice of all her sister States.\r\nLast evening I did not believe this event possible. There was one\r\nobstacle--Horatio Seymour's earnest, sincere, deep-felt repugnance to\r\naccept this nomination. I did not believe any circumstance would make\r\nit possible except that Ohio, with whom we have been unfortunately\r\ndividing our votes, demanded it. I was anxious that whenever we should\r\nleave this convention there should be no heart-burnings, no jealousy,\r\nno bitter disappointment; and I believe that in this result we have\r\nlifted the convention far above every such consideration. And I\r\nbelieve further that we have made the nomination most calculated to\r\ngive us success.\"[1177]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1176: New York _Times_, Sept. 4, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1177: New York _World_, July 10.]\r\n\r\nThis did not then seem to be the opinion of many men outside the\r\nconvention. The nomination did not arouse even a simulated enthusiasm\r\nupon the streets of the metropolis.[1178] In Washington Democratic\r\ncongressmen declared that but one weaker candidate was before the\r\nconvention,[1179] while dispatches from Philadelphia and Boston\r\nrepresented \"prominent Democrats disgusted at Seymour and the\r\nartifices of his friends.\"[1180] Even Tammany, said the _Times_,\r\n\"quailed at the prospect of entering upon a canvass with a leader\r\ncovered with personal dishonour, as Seymour had said himself he would\r\nbe, if he should accept. Men everywhere admit that such a nomination,\r\nconferred under such circumstances, was not only pregnant with\r\ndisaster, but if accepted stained the recipient with personal\r\ninfamy.\"[1181]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1178: New York _Times_, July 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1179: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1180: New York _Times_, July 10, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1181: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nNot since the Democratic party began holding national conventions had\r\nthe tactics practised at New York been equaled. The convention of 1844\r\nmust always be ranked as a masterpiece of manipulation, but its\r\ndiplomacy was played to defeat Van Buren rather than nominate a\r\ncandidate. In 1852 circumstances combined to prevent the nomination of\r\nthe convention's first or second choice, and in the end, as a\r\nball-player at the bat earns first base through the errors of a\r\npitcher, Franklin Pierce benefited. But in 1868 nothing was gained by\r\nerrors. Although there was a chief candidate to defeat, it was not\r\ndone with a bludgeon as in 1844. Nor were delegates allowed to\r\nstampede to a \"dark horse\" as in 1852. On the contrary, while the\r\nleading candidate suffered slow strangulation, the most conspicuous\r\nman in the party was pushed to the front with a sagacity and firmness\r\nthat made men obey the dictates of a superior intelligence, and to\r\npeople who studied the ballots it plainly appeared that Samuel J.\r\nTilden had played the game.\r\n\r\nTilden had not sought prominence in the convention. He seldom spoke,\r\nrarely figured in the meeting of delegates, and except to cast the\r\nvote of the New York delegation did nothing to attract attention. But\r\nthe foresight exhibited in changing from Church to Hendricks on the\r\neighth ballot discovered a mind singularly skilled in controlling the\r\nactions of men. The play appeared the more remarkable after the\r\nrevelation of its influence. New York did not want Hendricks. Besides,\r\nup to that time, the Hoosier had received less than forty votes, his\r\nown State refusing to unite in his support. Moreover, since adjoining\r\nStates save Michigan warmly advocated Pendleton, all sources of growth\r\nseemed closed to him. Yet Tilden's guiding hand, with infallible\r\nsagacity, placed New York's thirty-three votes on Indiana and\r\nabsolutely refused to move them. To dispose of Hendricks, Vallandigham\r\nand other Ohio delegates offered to support Chase, and if the chairman\r\nof the New York delegation had led the way, a formidable coalition\r\nmust have carried the convention for the Chief Justice. But the man\r\nwhose subtile, mysterious influence was already beginning to be\r\nrecognised as a controlling factor in the party desired Seymour, and\r\nto force his nomination he met at Delmonico's, on the evening of the\r\nfourth day, Allen G. Thurman, George E. Pugh, Washington McLean,\r\nGeorge W. McCook, and George W. Morgan, Ohio's most influential\r\ndelegates, and there arranged the _coup d'état_ that succeeded so\r\nadmirably. This scheme remained a profound secret until the Ohio\r\ndelegation retired for consultation after the twenty-first ballot, so\r\nthat when Seymour was addressing the New York delegation in behalf of\r\nChase, Tilden knew of the pending master-stroke. \"The artful Tilden,\"\r\nsaid Alexander Long, a well-known politician of the day, \"is a\r\ncandidate for the United States Senate, and he thinks that with\r\nSeymour the Democrats can carry both branches of the New York\r\nLegislature.\"[1182]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1182: New York _Times_, September 4, 1868.]\r\n\r\nTilden disclaimed all instrumentality in bringing about the\r\nnomination. \"I had no agency,\" he wrote, \"in getting Governor Seymour\r\ninto his present scrape.\"[1183] He likewise professed ignorance as to\r\nwhat the convention would do. \"I did not believe the event possible,\"\r\nhe said, \"unless Ohio demanded it.\"[1184] This admission, frankly\r\nconceding the necessity of Ohio's action which he had himself forced,\r\nshattered the sincerity of Tilden's disclaimer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1183: John Bigelow, _Life of Samuel J. Tilden_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1184: New York _World_, July 10, 1868.]\r\n\r\nSeymour also had difficulty in preserving the appearance of sincerity.\r\nThe press claimed that when he saw the nomination coming to him with\r\nthe approval of Pendleton's supporters he quickly retired instead of\r\nfurther insisting upon his declination. This insinuation allied his\r\ndramatic performance with Tilden's tactics, and he hesitated to expose\r\nhimself to such a compromising taunt. In this emergency Tilden\r\nendeavoured very adroitly to ease his mind. \"My judgment is,\" he wrote\r\na mutual friend, \"that acceptance under present circumstances would\r\nnot compromise his repute for sincerity or be really misunderstood by\r\nthe people; that the case is not analogous to the former instances\r\nwhich have made criticism possible; that the true nature of the\r\nsacrifice should be appreciated, while on the other hand the opposite\r\ncourse would be more likely to incite animadversion; that, on the\r\nwhole, acceptance is the best thing. I think a decision is necessary,\r\nfor it is not possible to go through a canvass with a candidate\r\ndeclining. I am sincerely willing to accept such action as will be\r\nmost for the honour of our friend; at the same time my personal wish\r\nis acceptance. You may express for me so much on the subject as you\r\nfind necessary and think proper.\"[1185]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1185: John Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 1, p. 212.]\r\n\r\nOn August 4, when Seymour finally accepted, he neither apologised nor\r\nexplained. \"The nomination,\" he wrote, \"was unsought and unexpected. I\r\nhave been caught up by the overwhelming tide which is bearing us on to\r\na great political change, and I find myself unable to resist its\r\npressure.\"[1186] Those who recalled the Governor's alleged tortuous\r\ncourse at Chicago and again at Albany in 1864 did not credit him with\r\nthe candour that excites admiration. \"Such men did not believe in the\r\nsincerity of Seymour's repeated declinations,\" said Henry J. Raymond,\r\n\"and therefore accepted the final result with the significant remark,\r\n'I told you so.'\"[1187] Horace Greeley was more severe. \"The means by\r\nwhich Horatio Seymour obtained his nomination,\" he wrote, \"are\r\ncharacteristic of that political cunning which has marked his career.\r\nThe whole affair was an adroit specimen of political hypocrisy, by\r\nwhich the actual favourite of the majority was not only sold, but was\r\ninduced to nominate the trickster who had defeated him.\"[1188]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1186: _Public Record of Horatio Seymour_, p. 343.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1187: New York _Times_, August 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1188: New York _Tribune_, November 5, 1868.]\r\n\r\nAfter Seymour's nomination the first expression of the campaign\r\noccurred in Vermont. Although largely Republican the Democrats made an\r\nunusually animated contest, sending their best speakers and furnishing\r\nthe needed funds. Nevertheless, the Republicans added 7,000 to their\r\nmajority of the preceding year. This decisive victory, celebrated in\r\nAlbany on September 2, had a depressing influence upon the Democratic\r\nState convention then in session, ending among other things the\r\ncandidacy of Henry C. Murphy for governor. The up-State opponents of\r\nthe Tweed ring, joined by the Kings County delegation, hoped to make a\r\nwinning combination against John T. Hoffman, and for several days\r\nMurphy stood up against the attacks of Tammany, defying its threats\r\nand refusing to withdraw. But he wilted under the news from Vermont.\r\nIf not beaten in convention, he argued, defeat is likely to come in\r\nthe election, and so, amidst the noise of booming cannon and parading\r\nRepublicans, he allowed Hoffman to be nominated by acclamation.[1189]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1189: \"Then we have John T. Hoffman, who is kept by Tammany\r\nHall as a kind of respectable attaché. His humble work is to wear good\r\nclothes and be always gloved, to be decorous and polite; to be as much\r\na model of deportment as Mr. Turvydrop; to repeat as often as need be,\r\nin a loud voice, sentences about 'honesty' and 'public welfare,' but\r\nto appoint to rich places such men as Mr. Sweeny. Hoffman is kept for\r\nthe edification of the country Democrats, but all he has or ever can\r\nhave comes from Tammany Hall.\"--_Ibid._, March 5, 1868.]\r\n\r\nIn the selection of a lieutenant-governor Tammany did not fare so\r\nwell. Boss Tweed, in return for Western support of Hoffman, had\r\ndeclared for Albert P. Laning of Buffalo, and until District Attorney\r\nMorris of Brooklyn seconded the nomination of another, Laning's\r\nfriends had boasted a large majority. Morris said he had no objection\r\nto Laning personally. He simply opposed him as a conspirator who had\r\ncombined with Tammany to carry out the programme of a grasping clique.\r\nHe wished the country delegates who had unconsciously aided its\r\nwire-pulling schemes to understand that it sought only its own\r\naggrandisement. It cared nothing for the Democratic party except as it\r\ncontributed to its selfish ends. This corrupt oligarchy, continued the\r\norator, his face flushed and his eyes flashing with anger, intends\r\nthrough Hoffman to control the entire patronage of the State, and if\r\nSeymour is elected it will grasp that of the whole country. Suppose\r\nthis offensive ring, with its unfinished courthouse and its thousand\r\nother schemes of robbery and plunder, controls the political power of\r\nthe State and nation as it now dominates the metropolis, what honest\r\nDemocrat can charge corruption to the opposite party? Did men from the\r\ninterior of the State understand that Hoffman for governor means a\r\nring magnate for United Sates senator? That is the game, and if it\r\ncannot be played by fair means, trickery and corruption will\r\naccomplish it. Kings County, which understands the methods of this\r\nclique, has not now and he hoped never would have anything in common\r\nwith it, and he warned the country members not to extend its wicked\r\nsway.[1190]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1190: New York _Times_, _World_, and _Tribune_, September 3,\r\n1868.]\r\n\r\nMorris' speech anticipated the startling disclosures of 1871, and as\r\nthe orator raised his voice to a pitch that could easily be heard\r\nthroughout the hall, the up-State delegates became deeply interested\r\nin his words. He did not deal in glittering generalities. He was a\r\nprosecuting officer in a county adjoining Tammany, and when he\r\nreferred to the courthouse robbery he touched the spot that reeked\r\nwith corruption. The Ring winced, but remained speechless. Tweed and\r\nhis associate plunderers, who had spent three millions on the\r\ncourthouse and charged on their books an expenditure of eleven, had\r\nno desire to stir up discussion on such a topic and be pilloried by a\r\ncross-examination on the floor of the convention. A majority of the\r\ndelegates, however, convinced that Tammany must not control the\r\nlieutenant-governor, nominated Allen C. Beach of Jefferson, giving him\r\n77 votes to 47 for Laning.[1191]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1191: New York _World_, July 10, 1868.]\r\n\r\nIn the light of this result Murphy's friends seriously regretted his\r\nhasty withdrawal from the contest. Morris intended arraigning Tammany\r\nin his speech, nominating the Brooklyn Senator for governor, and the\r\nlatter's supporters believed that Hoffman, whom they recognised as the\r\npersonal representative of the Tweed ring, must have gone down under\r\nthe disclosures of the District Attorney quite as easily as did\r\nLaning. This hasty opinion, however, did not have the support of\r\ntruth. Hoffman's campaign in 1866 strengthened him with the people of\r\nthe up-counties. To them he had a value of his own. In his speeches he\r\nhad denounced wrongs and rebuked corruption, and his record as mayor\r\ndisplayed no disposition to enrich himself at the expense of his\r\nreputation. He was careful at least to observe surface proprieties.\r\nBesides, at this time, Tammany had not been convicted of crime.\r\nVitriolic attacks upon the Tweed Ring were frequent, but they came\r\nfrom men whom it had hurt. Even Greeley's historic philippic, as\r\nfamous for its style as for its deadly venom, came in revenge for\r\nTweed's supposed part in defeating him for Congress in 1866.[1192]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1192: New York _Tribune_, March 5.\r\n\r\nThe ticket nominated was as follows: Governor, John T. Hoffman, New\r\nYork; Lieutenant-Governor, Allen C. Beach, Jefferson; Canal\r\nCommissioner, Oliver Bascom, Washington; Inspector of Prisons, David\r\nB. McNeil, Cayuga; Clerk of Court of Appeals, Edward O. Perrin,\r\nQueens.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE STATE CARRIED BY FRAUD\r\n\r\n1868\r\n\r\n\r\nHoratio Seymour's nomination for President worried his Republican\r\nopponents in New York. It was admitted that he would adorn the great\r\noffice, and that if elected he could act with more authority and\r\nindependence than Chief Justice Chase, since the latter must have been\r\nregarded by Congress as a renegade and distrusted by Democrats as a\r\nradical. It was agreed, also, that the purity of Seymour's life, his\r\ncharacter for honesty in financial matters, and the high social\r\nposition which he held, made him an especially dangerous adversary in\r\na State that usually dominated a national election. On the other hand,\r\nhis opponents recalled that whenever a candidate for governor he had\r\nnot only run behind his ticket, but had suffered defeat three out of\r\nfive times. It was suggested, too, that although his whole public life\r\nhad been identified with the politics of the Commonwealth, his name,\r\nunlike that of Daniel D. Tompkins, DeWitt Clinton, or Silas Wright,\r\nwas associated with no important measure of State policy. To this\r\ncriticism Seymour's supporters justly replied that as governor, in\r\n1853, he had boldly championed the great loan of ten and one-half\r\nmillions for the Erie Canal enlargement.\r\n\r\nAs usual national issues controlled the campaign in New York. Although\r\nboth parties denounced corruption in the repair of the Erie Canal, the\r\npeople seemed more concerned in a return of good times and in a better\r\nunderstanding between the North and South. The financial depression of\r\nthe year before had not disappeared, and an issue of greenbacks in\r\npayment of the 5-20 bonds, it was argued, would overcome the policy\r\nof contraction which had enhanced the face value of debts and\r\ndecreased the price of property. Pendleton's tour through Maine\r\nemphasised this phase of the financial question, and while Democrats\r\ntalked of \"The same currency for ploughboy and bondholder,\"\r\nRepublicans insisted upon \"The best currency for both ploughboy and\r\nbondholder.\"\r\n\r\nThe campaign in Maine, however, satisfied Republicans that the\r\nSouthern question, forced into greater prominence by recent acts of\r\nviolence, had become a more important issue than the financial\r\nproblem. In Saint Mary's parish, Louisiana, a Republican sheriff and\r\njudge were shot, editors and printers run out of the county, and their\r\nnewspaper offices destroyed. But no arrests followed. In Arkansas a\r\nRepublican deputy sheriff was tied to a negro and both killed with one\r\nshot. In South Carolina a colored State senator, standing on the\r\nplatform of a street car, suffered the death penalty, his executioners\r\npublicly boasting of their act. In Georgia negro members of the\r\nLegislature were expelled. Indeed, from every Southern State came\r\nreports of violence and murder. These stories were accentuated by the\r\nCamilla riot in Georgia, which occurred on September 19. With banners\r\nand music three hundred Republicans, mostly negroes, were marching to\r\nCamilla to hold a mass meeting. Two-thirds of them carried arms.\r\nBefore reaching the town the sheriff endeavoured to persuade them to\r\nlay aside their guns and revolvers, and upon their refusal a riot\r\nensued, in which eight or nine negroes were killed and twenty or\r\nthirty wounded. As usual their assailants escaped arrest and injury.\r\nGeneral Meade, commander of the department, reported that \"the authors\r\nof this outrage were civil officers who, under the guise of enforcing\r\nthe law and suppressing disorder, had permitted a wanton sacrifice of\r\nlife and blood.\"[1193]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1193: Report of the Secretary of War, 1868, p. 81.]\r\n\r\nThe mere recital of these incidents aroused Northern feeling. It was\r\nthe old story--murder without arrests or investigation. The\r\nknowledge, too, that it was in part the work of the Ku-Klux-Klan, a\r\nsecret organisation pledged to disfranchise the negro by intimidation,\r\nintensified the bitterness. It is probably true that many reported\r\natrocities were merely campaign stories. It is likely, too, that horse\r\nthieves and illicit distillers screened their misdeeds behind the\r\nKu-Klux. It is well understood, also, that ambitious carpet-bag\r\nagitators, proving bad instructors for negroes just emerging from\r\nslavery, added largely to the list of casualties, making crime appear\r\ngeneral throughout the South. But whether violence was universal or\r\nsporadic Republicans believed it a dangerous experiment to commit the\r\ngovernment to the hands of \"rebels and copperheads,\" and in their\r\ncontest to avoid such an alleged calamity they emphasised Southern\r\noutrages and resurrected Seymour's speech to the draft rioters in\r\nJuly, 1863. To give the latter fresh interest Nast published a cartoon\r\nentitled \"Matched,\"[1194] which represented Grant demanding the\r\nunconditional surrender of Vicksburg, while Seymour, addressing a mob\r\nof foreigners wet with the blood of their victims, called them \"my\r\nfriends.\" Nast presented another cartoon which disturbed the\r\nDemocracy. It represented John T. Hoffman standing before a screen\r\nbehind which a gang of thieves was busily rifling the city treasury.\r\nThe face of Hoffman only was depicted, but the picture's serious note\r\nof warning passed for more than a bit of campaign pleasantry. Frank P.\r\nBlair, the Democratic candidate for Vice-President, also furnished a\r\ntext for bitter invective because of his declaration that \"there is\r\nbut one way to restore the government and the Constitution and that is\r\nfor the President-elect to declare the Reconstruction Acts null and\r\nvoid, compel the army to undo its usurpations at the South, disperse\r\nthe carpet-bag State governments, allow the white people to reorganise\r\ntheir own governments and elect senators and representatives.\"[1195]\r\nRepublicans charged that this represented the Democratic policy. On\r\nthe other hand, the closing sentence of Grant's brief letter of\r\nacceptance, \"Let us have peace,\" became the shibboleth of his\r\nfollowers, who claimed that the courteous and deferential spirit shown\r\nat Appomattox would characterise his administration. Indeed, the issue\r\nfinally resolved itself to \"Blair and Revolution\" or \"Grant and\r\nPeace,\" and after a contest of unusual bitterness Republicans carried\r\nthe October States, although with greatly reduced majorities.\r\nPennsylvania gave only 10,000, Ohio 17,000, and Indiana less than\r\n1,000.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1194: Albert B. Paine, _Life of Thomas Nast_, p. 130.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1195: McPherson, _History of Reconstruction_, p. 381.]\r\n\r\nThough these elections presaged a Republican victory in November,\r\nDemocrats, still hopeful of success, renewed their efforts with great\r\nenergy. Blair went to the rear and Seymour took the stump. With\r\nstudied moderation Seymour had written his letter of acceptance to\r\ncatch the wavering Republican voter. He made it appear that the South\r\nwas saved from anarchy by the military, and that the North, to the\r\nsincere regret of many Republicans and their ablest journals, was no\r\nlonger controlled by the sober judgment of the dominant party's safest\r\nleaders. \"There is hardly an able man who helped to build up the\r\nRepublican organisation,\" he said, \"who has not within the past three\r\nyears warned it against its excesses.\" These men he pictured as forced\r\nto give up their sentiments or to abandon their party, arguing that\r\nthe latter's policy must be more violent in future unless checked by a\r\ndivision of political power. \"Such a division,\" he said, adroitly\r\nseeking to establish confidence in himself, \"tends to assure the peace\r\nand good order of society. The election of a Democratic Executive and\r\na majority of Democratic members to the House of Representatives would\r\nnot give to that party organisation the power to make sudden or\r\nviolent changes, but it would serve to check those extreme measures\r\nwhich have been deplored by the best men of both political\r\norganisations.\"[1196]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1196: Horatio Seymour, _Public Record_, p. 345.]\r\n\r\nPreaching this gospel of peace Seymour passed through Western New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, attempting to\r\novercome the prestige of Grant's great fame, and to stem the tide of\r\nNorthern prejudice against Southern outrages. Meanwhile Roscoe\r\nConkling, having returned from a pleasure trip to Denver, entered the\r\ncampaign with earnestness against his brother-in-law. He desired\r\nespecially to carry Oneida County, to which he devoted his energies in\r\nthe closing days of the contest, making a schoolhouse canvass that\r\nlifted the issue above local pride in its distinguished citizen who\r\nheaded the Democratic ticket. In going the rounds he met \"Black\r\nPaddy,\" a swarthy Irishman and local celebrity, who announced that he\r\nhad \"turned Democrat.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" asked the Senator.\r\n\r\n\"Shure, sir,\" replied the quick-witted Celt, \"O'im payin' ye a\r\ncompliment in votin' for your brother-in-law.\"[1197]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1197: A.R. Conkling, _Life of Roscoe Conkling_, p. 313.]\r\n\r\nNear the close of the campaign, in accordance with the habit of many\r\nyears, William H. Seward returned to Auburn to speak to his neighbors\r\nand townsmen. No one then realised that this was to be his last\r\npolitical meeting, or that before another presidential election\r\noccurred he would have entered upon his long sleep on Fort Hill. But\r\nthe hall was as full as if it had been so advertised. He was neither\r\nan old man, being sixty-seven, nor materially changed in appearance.\r\nPerhaps his face was a trifle thinner, his hair lighter, and his jaw\r\nmore prominent, but his mental equipment survived as in the olden days\r\nwhen the splendid diction hit the tone and temper of the anti-slavery\r\nhosts. His speech, however, showed neither the spirit that nerved him\r\nin the earlier time, nor the resources that formerly sustained him in\r\nvigorous and persuasive argument. He spoke rather in a vein of\r\nextenuation and reminiscence, as one whose work, judged by its\r\nbeginnings, had perhaps ended unsatisfactorily as well as illogically,\r\nand for which there was no sufficient reason.[1198]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1198: _Seward's Works_, Vol. 5, pp. 550-556.]\r\n\r\nThis speech had the effect of widening the breach between him and his\r\nold associates, who bitterly resented his apparent indifference in the\r\ngreat contest, while men of a younger generation, looking at him with\r\nwonder and interest, found it hard to realise that he had been one of\r\nthe most conspicuous and energetic figures in political life. How\r\ncomplete was the loss of his political influence is naïvely\r\nillustrated by Andrew D. White. \"Mr. Cornell and I were arranging a\r\nprogramme for the approaching annual commencement when I suggested Mr.\r\nSeward for the main address. Mr. Cornell had been one of Mr. Seward's\r\nlifelong supporters, but he received this proposal coldly, pondered it\r\nfor a few moments silently, and then said dryly: 'Perhaps you are\r\nright, but if you call him you will show to our students the deadest\r\nman that ain't buried in the State of New York.'\"[1199]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1199: _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 151.]\r\n\r\nSamuel J. Tilden voiced the supreme ante-election confidence of the\r\nDemocrats. \"Speaking from an experience of more than thirty years in\r\npolitical observation and political action,\" he said, \"I do not\r\nhesitate to say that in no presidential conflict since the days of\r\nAndrew Jackson have omens of victory to any party or any cause been so\r\nclear, so numerous, and so inspiring as those which now cheer the\r\nparty of the national Democracy to battle in the cause of American\r\nliberty.\"[1200] The victory of 1867, in the opinion of leading\r\nDemocrats, had removed the Empire State from the doubtful list, but\r\nwhile proclaiming their confidence of success many of them knew that a\r\nconfidential circular, issued from the rooms of the Democratic State\r\nCommittee and bearing the signature of Samuel J. Tilden, instructed\r\ncertain persons in each of the up-State counties to telegraph William\r\nM. Tweed, \"the minute the polls close and at his expense,\" the\r\nprobable Republican majority.[1201] Its purpose was plain. The\r\nconspirators desired to know how many fraudulent votes would be needed\r\nto overcome the Republican superiority, and their method, then novel\r\nand ingenious, avoided all chance of failure to carry the State.\r\nTilden denied knowledge of this circular. He also disclaimed its evil\r\npurpose, but preferred to remain silent rather than denounce the\r\nforgers.[1202]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1200: John Bigelow, _Life of Samuel J. Tilden_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n217.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1201: New York _Tribune_, November 14, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1202: New York _Evening Post_, November 4, 1868; _Harper's\r\nWeekly_, September 30, 1876.]\r\n\r\nForewarned by the returns of 1867 Griswold's supporters, fearing fraud\r\nin the metropolis, invoked the aid of the United States Court to\r\nprevent the use of forged naturalisation papers, which resulted in the\r\nindictment of several men and the publication of fraudulent registry\r\nlists. Against such action John T. Hoffman, as mayor, violently\r\nprotested. \"We are on the eve of an important election,\" said his\r\nproclamation. \"Intense excitement pervades the whole community.\r\nUnscrupulous, designing, and dangerous men, political partisans, are\r\nresorting to extraordinary means to increase it. Gross and unfounded\r\ncharges of fraud are made by them against those high in authority.\r\nThreats are made against naturalised citizens, and a federal grand\r\njury has been induced to find, in great haste and secrecy, bills of\r\nindictment for the purpose, openly avowed, of intimidating them in the\r\ndischarge of their public duties.... Let no citizen, however, be\r\ndeterred by any threats or fears, but let him assert his rights boldly\r\nand resolutely, and he will find his perfect protection under the laws\r\nand the lawfully constituted authorities of the State. By virtue of\r\nauthority invested in me I hereby offer a reward of $100 to be paid on\r\nthe arrest and conviction of any person charged ... with intimidating,\r\nobstructing or defrauding any voter in the exercise of his right as an\r\nelector.\"[1203] Thus did the Tweed Ring strike back.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1203: New York _Times_, November 2, 1868.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the election in the country at large deeply disappointed\r\nthe Democrats. Grant obtained 214 electoral votes in twenty-six\r\nStates, while Seymour secured 80 in eight States. In New York,\r\nhowever, the conspirators did their word well. Although the\r\nRepublicans won a majority in both branches of the Legislature and\r\nelected eighteen of the thirty-one congressmen, Seymour carried the\r\nState by 10,000 and Hoffman by 27,946.\r\n\r\nAfter the election the Union League Club charged that in New York City\r\nfalse naturalisation and fraudulent voting had been practised upon a\r\ngigantic scale. It appeared from its report that one man sold seven\r\nthousand fraudulent naturalisation certificates; that thousands of\r\nfictitious names, with false residences attached, were enrolled, and\r\nthat gangs of repeaters marched from poll to poll, voting many times\r\nin succession. The _Tribune_ showed that in twenty election districts\r\nthe vote cast for Hoffman largely exceeded the registry lists, already\r\nheavily padded with fictitious names, and that by comparison with\r\nother years the aggregate State vote clearly revealed the work of the\r\nconspirators.[1204] Instead of being the choice of the people, it said,\r\n\"Hoffman was 'elected' by the most infamous system of fraud.\"[1205]\r\nAndrew D. White wrote that \"the gigantic frauds perpetrated in the\r\nsinks and dens of the great city have overborne the truthful vote and\r\nvoice of the Empire State. The country knows this, and the Democratic\r\nparty, flushed with a victory which fraud has won, hardly cares to\r\ndeny it.\"[1206] A few months later Conkling spoke of it as a well known\r\nfact that John T. Hoffman was counted in. \"The election was a\r\nbarbarous burlesque,\" he continued. \"Many thousand forged\r\nnaturalisation papers were issued; some of them were white and some\r\nwere coffee-coloured. The same witnesses purported to attest hundreds\r\nand thousands of naturalisation affidavits, and the stupendous fraud\r\nof the whole thing was and is an open secret.... Repeating, ballot-box\r\nstuffing, ruffianism, and false counting decided everything. Tweed\r\nmade the election officers, and the election officers were corrupt.\r\nThirty thousand votes were falsely added to the Democratic majority in\r\nNew York and Brooklyn alone. Taxes and elections were the mere spoil\r\nand booty of a corrupt junta in Tammany. Usurpation and fraud\r\ninaugurated a carnival of corrupt disorder; and obscene birds without\r\nnumber swooped down to the harvest and gorged themselves on every side\r\nin plunder and spoliation.\"[1207]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1204: New York _Tribune_, November 6, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1205: _Ibid._, November 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1206: _Ibid._, November 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1207: From speech of Conkling delivered in the U.S. Senate,\r\nApril 24, 1879.--Thomas V. Cooper, _American Politics_, Book 3, p.\r\n180.]\r\n\r\nWhen Congress convened a committee, appointed to investigate\r\nnaturalisation frauds in the city of New York, reported that prior to\r\n1868 the Common Pleas and Superior Courts, controlling matters of\r\nnaturalisation, annually averaged, from 1856 to 1867, 9,000 new\r\nvoters, but that after the Supreme Court began making citizens on\r\nOctober 6, 1868, the number rapidly increased to 41,112. Several\r\nrevelations added interest to this statement. Judge Daly served in the\r\nCommon Pleas, while McCunn, Barnard, Cardozo, and others whom Tweed\r\ncontrolled, sat in the Supreme and Superior Courts. Daly required from\r\nthree to five minutes to examine an applicant, but McCunn boasted that\r\nhe could do it in thirty seconds, with the result that the Supreme\r\nCourt naturalised from 1,800 to 2,100 per day, whereas the Common\r\nPleas during the entire year acted upon only 3,140. On the other hand,\r\nthe Supreme and Superior Courts turned out 37,967. \"One day last week\r\none of our 'upright judges,'\" said the _Nation_, \"invited a friend to\r\nsit by him while he played a little joke. Then he left off calling\r\nfrom the list before him and proceeded to call purely imaginary names\r\ninvented by himself on the spur of the moment: John Smith, James\r\nSnooks, Thomas Noakes, and the like. For every name a man instantly\r\nanswered and took a certificate. Finally, seeing a person scratching\r\nhis head, the judge called out, 'George Scratchem!' 'Here,' responded\r\na voice. 'Take that man outside to scratch,' said his honour to an\r\nusher, and resumed the more regular manufacture of voters.\"[1208]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1208: The _Nation_, October 29, 1868.]\r\n\r\nTo show that a conspiracy existed to commit fraud, the committee\r\nsubmitted valuable evidence contributed by the clerks of these courts.\r\nInstead of printing the usual number of blank certificates based on\r\nthe annual average of 9,000, they ordered, between September 16 and\r\nOctober 23, more than seven times as many, or 69,000, of which 39,000\r\nwent to the Supreme Court. As this court had just gone into the\r\nnaturalisation business the order seemed suspiciously large. At the\r\ntime of the investigation 27,068 of these certificates were\r\nunaccounted for, and the court refused an examination of its records.\r\nHowever, by showing that the vote cast in 1868, estimated upon the\r\naverage rate of the increase of voters, should have been 131,000\r\ninstead of 156,000, the committee practically accounted for them. The\r\n_Nation_ unwittingly strengthened this measured extent of the fraud,\r\ndeclaring on the day the courts finished their work, that of \"the\r\n35,000 voters naturalised in this city alone, 10,000 are perhaps\r\nrightly admitted, 10,000 have passed through the machine without\r\nhaving been here five years, and the other 15,000 have never been near\r\nthe courtroom.\"[1209] A table also published by the committee showed\r\nthe ratio of votes to the population at each of the five preceding\r\npresidential elections to have been 1 to 8, while in 1868 it was 1 to\r\n4.65. \"The only fair conclusion from these facts would be,\" said the\r\n_Nation_, \"that enormous frauds were perpetrated.\"[1210]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1209: The _Nation_, October 29, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1210: _Ibid._, March 4, 1869.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Democratic minority of the committee, after\r\nexamining Hoffman and Tweed, who disclaimed any knowledge of the\r\ntransactions and affected to disbelieve the truth of the charges,\r\npronounced the facts cited \"stale slanders,\" and most of the witnesses\r\n\"notorious swindlers, liars, and thieves,\" declaring that the\r\nfraudulent vote did not exceed 2,000, divided equally between the two\r\nparties. Moreover, it pronounced the investigation a shameful effort\r\nto convict the Democracy of crimes that were really the result of the\r\nlong-continued misgovernment of the Republicans. If that party\r\ncontrolled the city, declared one critic, it would become as adept in\r\n\"repeating\" as it was in \"gerrymandering\" the State, whose Legislature\r\ncould not be carried by the Democrats when their popular majority\r\nexceeded 48,000 as in 1867. This sarcastic thrust emphasised the\r\nnotorious gerrymander which, in spite of the Tammany frauds, gave the\r\nRepublicans a legislative majority of twenty-four on joint-ballot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF MONEY IN SENATORIAL ELECTIONS\r\n\r\n1869\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election of a legislative majority in 1868 plunged the Republicans\r\ninto a fierce contest over the choice of a successor to Edwin D.\r\nMorgan, whose term in the United States Senate ended on March 4. In\r\nbitterness it resembled the historic battle between Weed and Greeley\r\nin 1861. Morgan had made several mistakes. His support of Johnson\r\nduring the first year of the latter's Administration discredited him,\r\nand although he diligently laboured to avoid all remembrance of it,\r\nthe patronage which the President freely gave had continued to\r\nidentify him with the Johnsonised federal officials. To overcome this\r\ndistrust he presented letters from Sumner and Wade, testifying to his\r\nloyalty to the more radical element of the party.[1211] A revival of\r\nthe story of his opposition to Wadsworth in 1862 also embarrassed him.\r\nHe had overcome it when first elected to the Senate by the sustaining\r\nhand of Thurlow Weed, whose position in the management of the party\r\nwas strengthened by Wadsworth's defeat; but now Weed was absent, and\r\nto aid in meeting the ugly charges which rendered his way devious and\r\ndifficult, Morgan had recourse to Edwin M. Stanton, who wrote that\r\nWadsworth, distinguishing the Senator from his betrayers, repeatedly\r\nspoke of him as a true friend and faithful supporter.[1212]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1211: New York _Tribune_, January 13 and 18, 1869.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1212: New York _Times_, January 12, 1869.]\r\n\r\nMorgan's strength, though of a negative kind, had its head concealed\r\nunder the coils of Conkling's position. It was manifest that the\r\nlatter's admirers were combining to depose Reuben E. Fenton, Morgan's\r\nchief competitor for the senatorial toga. Chester A. Arthur, looking\r\ninto the future, had already recognised the need of a new alignment,\r\nand the young Senator evidenced the qualities that appealed to him.\r\nThere was a common impression that if Morgan were re-elected, he would\r\nyield to the greater gifts of Conkling and the purpose, now so\r\napparent, was to crush Fenton and make Conkling the head of an\r\norganisation which should include both Senators. John A. Griswold\r\nunderstood this and declined to embarrass Morgan by entering the race.\r\n\r\nFenton at this time was at the height of his power. His lieutenants,\r\nheaded by Waldo M. Hutchins, the distributor of his patronage,\r\nexcelled in the gifts of strategy, which had been illustrated in the\r\nelection of Truman G. Younglove for speaker. They were dominated,\r\nalso, by the favourite doctrine of political leaders that organisation\r\nmust be maintained and victory won at any cost save by a revolution in\r\nparty policy, and they entered the senatorial contest with a courage\r\nas sublime as it was relentless. Their chief, too, possessed the\r\nconfidence of the party. His radicalism needed no sponsors. Besides,\r\nhis four years' service as governor, strengthened by the veto of\r\nseveral bills calculated to increase the public burdens, had received\r\nthe unmistakable approval of the people.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he was heavily handicapped. Greeley, still smarting under\r\nFenton's failure to support him for governor in 1868, declared for\r\nMarshall O. Roberts, while Noah Davis, surprised at his insincerity,\r\naided Morgan. If Greeley's grievance had merit, Davis' resentment was\r\ncertainly justified. The latter claimed that after Conkling's election\r\nin 1867, Fenton promised to support him in 1869, and that upon the\r\nGovernor's advice, to avoid the prejudice against a judge who engaged\r\nin politics, he had resigned from the Supreme Court and made a winning\r\nrace for Congress.[1213]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1213: New York _World_, January 6, 1869.]\r\n\r\nBut the _Commercial Advertiser_, a journal then conducted by\r\nConservatives, placed the most serious obstacle in Fenton's pathway,\r\ncharging that an intimate friend of the Governor had received $10,000\r\non two occasions after the latter had approved bills for the New York\r\nDry Dock and the Erie Railroad Companies.[1214] Although the _Sun_\r\npromptly pronounced it \"a remarkable piece of vituperation,\"[1215] and\r\nthe _Tribune_, declaring \"its source of no account,\" called it \"a most\r\nscurrilous diatribe,\"[1216] the leading Democratic journal of the State\r\naccepted it as \"true.\"[1217] The story was not new. In the preceding\r\nsummer, during an investigation into the alleged bribery of members of\r\nthe Legislature of 1868, Henry Thompson, an Erie director, was asked\r\nif his company paid Governor Fenton any money for approving the bill\r\nlegalising the acts of its directors in the famous \"Erie war.\"\r\nThompson refused to answer as the question fell without the scope of\r\nthe committee's jurisdiction. Thereupon Thomas Murphy testified that\r\nThompson told him that he saw two checks of $10,000 each paid to\r\nHamilton Harris, the Governor's legal adviser, under an agreement that\r\nFenton should sign the bill. Murphy added that afterwards, as chairman\r\nof a Republican political committee, he asked Jay Gould, president of\r\nthe Erie company, for a campaign contribution, and was refused for the\r\nreason that he had already given $20,000 for Fenton. Harris and Gould\r\nknew nothing of the transaction.[1218]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1214: New York _Commercial Advertiser_, January 2, 1869.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1215: New York _Sun_, January 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1216: New York _Tribune_, January 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1217: New York _World_, January 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1218: The _Nation_, March 18.]\r\n\r\nMatthew Hale, chairman of the Senate investigating committee, did not\r\ninclude this testimony in his report, and the startling and improbable\r\npublication in the _Commercial Advertiser_ must have withered as the\r\nsensation of a day, had not the belief obtained that the use of money\r\nin senatorial contests played a prominent and important part. This\r\nscandalous practice was modern. Until 1863 nothing had been heard of\r\nthe use of money in such contests. But what was then whispered, and\r\nopenly talked about in 1867 as Conkling testified, now became a common\r\ntopic of conversation. \"It is conceded on all hands,\" said the\r\n_Times_, editorially, \"that money will decide the contest.\"[1219]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1219: New York _Times_, January 9, 1869.]\r\n\r\nTalk of this kind appealed to the pessimist who believes a legislator\r\nis always for sale, but Speaker Younglove, an assemblyman of long\r\nexperience, knowing that good committee appointments were more potent\r\nthan other influences, tactfully withheld the announcement of his\r\ncommittees. Such a proceeding had never before occurred in the history\r\nof the State, and twelve years later, when George H. Sharpe resorted\r\nto the same tactics, William B. Woodin declared that it made Younglove\r\n\"a political corpse.\"[1220] Nevertheless, Morgan soon understood that\r\nchairmanships and assignments on great committees were vastly more\r\nattractive than anything he had to offer, and on January 16 (1869) the\r\nfirst ballot of the caucus gave Fenton 52 votes to 40 for Morgan. A\r\nmonth later, Richard M. Blatchford, then a justice of the United\r\nStates Supreme Court, wrote Thurlow Weed: \"Morgan loses his election\r\nbecause, you being sick, his backbone was missing.\"[1221]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1220: New York _Tribune_, January 13, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1221: T.W. Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 462.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTWEED CONTROLS THE STATE\r\n\r\n1869-70\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam M. Tweed had become a State senator in 1867. At this time he\r\nheld seventeen city offices.[1222] But one more place did not embarrass\r\nhim, and in entering upon his new career he promptly invoked the\r\ntactics that strengthened him in the metropolis. Through the influence\r\nof a Republican colleague on the Board of Supervisors he secured\r\nappointments upon the important committees of Finance and Internal\r\nAffairs, the first passing upon all appropriations, and the second\r\ncontrolling most of the subordinate legislation in the State including\r\nExcise measures. This opportunity for reviewing general legislation\r\ngave him the advantage of a hawk circling in the sky of missing no\r\nchance for plunder. By means of generous hospitality and a natural\r\naffability he quickly won the esteem of his fellow senators, many of\r\nwhom responded to his gentle suggestion of city clerkships for\r\nconstituents. In his pretended zeal to serve Republicans he had\r\noffered, during the recent contest for United States senator, to\r\nmarshal the Democrats to the support of Charles J. Folger, the leader\r\nof the Senate, provided two Republican senators and twelve assemblymen\r\nwould vote for him.[1223] Persons familiar with Tweed's true character\r\nunderstood that a senator of Folger's integrity and ability would be\r\nless in the way at Washington than in Albany, but his apparent desire\r\nto help the Genevan did him no harm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1222: New York _Nation_, September 30, 1869.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1223: New York _World_, January 12, 1869.]\r\n\r\nThus intrenched in the good will of his colleagues Tweed, early in\r\nthe session, began debauching the tax levies for the city and county\r\nof New York. His party controlled the Assembly, and his henchman,\r\nWilliam Hitchman, whom he had made speaker, controlled its committees.\r\nWhat the Senate did, therefore, would be approved in the House. The\r\ntax levies contained items of expense based upon estimates by the\r\ndifferent departments of the municipal and county governments. They\r\nwere prepared by the comptroller, examined by the city council and\r\ncounty supervisors respectively, and submitted to the Legislature for\r\nits approval. In the process they might be swelled by the comptroller\r\nand the two boards, but the Legislature, acting as an outside and\r\ndisinterested party, usually trimmed them. Tweed, however, proposed to\r\nswell them again. Accordingly projects for public improvements,\r\nasylums, hospitals, and dispensaries that never existed except on\r\npaper, appeared as beneficiaries of county and city. The comptroller\r\nconcealed these thefts by the issue of stocks and bonds and the\r\ncreation of a floating debt, which formed no part of his\r\nstatements.[1224] When the committee on appropriations reported these\r\nadditions, \"the increase,\" it was claimed in the progress of the\r\ndiscussion, \"was called for only by plunderers.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1224: Gustavus Myers, _History of Tammany Hall_, p. 274.]\r\n\r\nThe passage of these vicious appropriations, requiring the help of\r\nRepublicans, gave rise to numerous charges of bribery and corruption.\r\n\"It was fully believed here,\" said the _Tribune_, \"that tax levies\r\nsupplied the means for fabricating naturalisation papers and hiring\r\nrepeaters whereby Republicans were swindled out of the vote of this\r\nState.\"[1225] Other corrupt practices in connection with important\r\nrailroad legislation, having special reference to the passage of the\r\nso-called \"Erie Bill,\" likewise attracted public attention. But\r\nMatthew Hale's investigating committee, after a long and fruitless\r\nsession in the summer of 1868, expressed the opinion that the crime of\r\nbribery could not be proven under the law as it then existed, since\r\nboth parties to the transaction were liable to punishment. This led\r\nto a new statute exempting from prosecution the giver of a bribe which\r\nwas accepted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1225: New York _Tribune_, July 24, 1869.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the Legislature elected in November, 1868, proved no less\r\nplastic in the hands of the Boss, who again corrupted the tax levies.\r\nAfter allowing every just item the committee coolly added six\r\nmillions,[1226] an amount subsequently reduced to three.[1227] This\r\niniquity was immediately denounced and exposed through pamphlets,\r\njournals, and debates. Men frankly admitted that no reason or economic\r\nprinciple justified the existence of such monstrous levies. Indeed,\r\nevery honest influence, legal, social, and political, opposed it. The\r\npress condemned it, good men mourned over it, and wise men unmasked\r\nit. But with the help of twenty Republicans, backed by the approval of\r\nJohn T. Hoffman, the bill became a law. This time, however,\r\nindignation did not die with the Legislature. The _Tribune_, charging\r\nthat the twenty Republican assemblymen whose names it published were\r\n\"bought and paid with cash stolen by means of tax levies,\" insisted\r\nthat \"the rascals\" should not be renominated. \"We firmly believe,\" it\r\nadded, \"that no Republican voted for these levies except for pay ...\r\nand we say distinctly that we do not want victory this fall if it is\r\nto be in all respects like the victory of last fall.\"[1228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1226: New York _Tribune_, July 24, 1869.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1227: _Ibid._, July 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1228: _Ibid._, July 24, and 29.]\r\n\r\nLocal party leaders, resenting the _Tribune's_ declarations, packed\r\nconventions, renominated the black-listed legislators, and spread such\r\ndemoralisation that George William Curtis, Thomas Hillhouse, and John\r\nC. Robinson withdrew from the State ticket. As a punishment for his\r\ncourse the State Committee, having little faith in the election of its\r\ncandidates, substituted Horace Greeley for comptroller in place of\r\nHillhouse.[1229] In accepting the nomination Greeley expressed the\r\nhope that it never would be said of him that he asked for an office,\r\nor declined an honourable service to which he was called.[1230]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1229: The Republican State convention, held at Syracuse on\r\nSeptember 30, 1869, nominated the following ticket: Secretary of\r\nstate, George William Curtis, Richmond; Comptroller Thomas Hillhouse,\r\nOntario; Treasurer, Thomas S. Chatfield, Tioga; Attorney-General,\r\nMartin I. Townsend, Rensselaer; Engineer and Surveyor, John C.\r\nRobinson, Broome; Canal Commissioner, Stephen F. Hoyt, Steuben; Prison\r\nInspector, Daniel D. Conover, New York; Court of Appeals, Lewis B.\r\nWoodruff, New York; Charles Mason, Madison.\r\n\r\nFranz Sigel, Horace Greeley, and William B. Taylor of Oneida were\r\nsubsequently substituted for Curtis, Hillhouse, and Robinson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1230: New York _Tribune_, October 11, 1869.]\r\n\r\nIf corruption had demoralised Republicans, fear of a repetition of the\r\nTweed frauds paralysed them. The plan of having counties telegraph the\r\nvotes needed to overcome an up-State majority could be worked again as\r\nsuccessfully as before, since the machinery existed and the men were\r\nmore dexterous. Besides, danger of legal punishment had disappeared.\r\nThe Union League Club had established nothing, the congressional\r\ninvestigation had resulted in no one's arrest, and Matthew Hale's\r\ncommittee had found existing law insufficient. Moreover, Hale had\r\nreported that newspaper charges were based simply upon rumours\r\nunsupported by proof.[1231]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1231: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1869, p. 486.]\r\n\r\nTweed understood all this, and his confidence whetted an ambition to\r\ncontrol the State as absolutely as he did the city. At the Syracuse\r\nconvention which assembled in September (1869) Tilden represented the\r\nonly influence that could be vitalised into organised opposition.\r\nTilden undoubtedly despised Tweed. Yet he gave him countenance and\r\nsaved the State chairmanship.[1232]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1232: The Democratic ticket was as follows: Secretary of\r\nstate, Homer A. Nelson, Dutchess; Comptroller, William F. Allen,\r\nOswego; Treasurer, Wheeler H. Bristol, Tioga; Attorney-General,\r\nMarshall B. Champlain, Allegany; State Engineer, Van Rensselaer\r\nRichmond, Wayne; Canal Commissioner, William W. Wright; Prison\r\nInspector, Fordyce Laflin, Ulster; Court of Appeals, John A. Lott,\r\nKings; Robert Earl, Herkimer.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign pivoted on the acceptance or rejection of the new State\r\nconstitution, framed by the convention of 1867 and submitted by the\r\nLegislature of 1869. From the first the constitutional convention had\r\nbecome a political body. Republicans controlled it, and their\r\ninsistence upon unrestricted negro suffrage gave colour to the whole\r\ndocument, until the Democrats, demanding its defeat, focused upon it\r\ntheir united opposition. As a candidate for comptroller Horace Greeley\r\nlikewise became an issue. Democrats could not forget his impatient,\r\npetulant, and, as they declared, unfair charges of election frauds,\r\nand every satirist made merry at his expense. To denunciation and\r\nabuse, however, Greeley paid no attention. \"They shall be most welcome\r\nto vote against me if they will evince unabated devotion to the cause\r\nof impartial suffrage.\"[1233] But the people, tired of Republican rule,\r\nturned the State over to the Democrats regardless of men.[1234]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1233: New York _Tribune_, October 11, 1869.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1234: Nelson for secretary of state over Sigel, 22,524; Allen\r\nfor comptroller over Greeley, 26,533; Greeley over Sigel in New York\r\nCity, 1,774; Sigel over Greeley in the State, 4,938; against the\r\nconstitution, 19,759; majority for the judiciary article, 6,006.--New\r\nYork _Tribune_, November 23, 1869.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this result was not unexpected, no one dreamed that the\r\nDemocracy would win every department of the State government,\r\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial. For seventeen years the\r\nDemocrats had twice elected the governor and once secured the\r\nAssembly, while the Republicans, holding the Senate continuously and\r\nthe governorship and Assembly most of the time, had come to regard\r\nthemselves the people's lawmakers and the representatives of executive\r\nauthority. But Tweed's quiet canvass in the southern tier of counties\r\ntraversed by the Erie Railroad exhibited rare cunning in the capture\r\nof the State Senate. Until this fortress of Republican opposition\r\nsurrendered, Hoffman's appointments, like those of Seward in 1839,\r\ncould not be confirmed.\r\n\r\nAfter this election William M. Tweed's supremacy was acknowledged. In\r\n1867 he had captured the Assembly and elected most of the State\r\nofficials; in 1868, after forcing the nomination of John T. Hoffman,\r\nhe made him governor by a system of gigantic frauds; and now in 1869,\r\nhaving employed similar tactics in the southern tier of counties, he\r\nhad carried the Senate by four majority, secured the Assembly by\r\nsixteen, and for the third time elected the State officials. This made\r\nhim leader of the State Democracy. Seymour so understood it, and\r\nTilden knew that he existed only as a figurehead.\r\n\r\nTweed's power became more apparent after the Legislature opened in\r\nJanuary, 1870. He again controlled the Assembly committees through\r\nWilliam Hitchman, his speaker; he arranged them to his liking in the\r\nSenate through Allen C. Beach, the lieutenant-governor; and he\r\nsweetened a majority of the members in both houses with substantial\r\nhopes of large rewards. This defeated an organisation, called the\r\nYoung Democracy, which hoped to break his power by the passage of a\r\nmeasure known as the Huckleberry Charter, transferring the duties of\r\nState commissions to the Board of Aldermen. Then Tweed appeared with a\r\ncharter. Sweeny was its author and home-rule its alleged object. It\r\nsubstituted for metropolitan commissions, devised and fostered by\r\nRepublicans, municipal departments charged with equivalent duties,\r\nwhose heads were appointed by the mayor. It also created a department\r\nof docks, and merged the election of city and state officials. Its\r\ncrowning audacity, however, was the substitution of a superintendent\r\nof public works for street commissioner, to be appointed by the mayor\r\nfor a term of four years, and to be removable only after an\r\nimpeachment trial, in which the entire six judges of the Common Pleas\r\nCourt must participate. It was apparent that this charter perpetuated\r\nwhatever was most feared in the system of commissions, and obliterated\r\nall trace of the corrective. It was obvious, also, that by placing\r\nofficials beyond the reach of everybody interested in their good\r\nbehaviour except the Courts, whose aid could be invoked only by the\r\nmayor, and by him only for the extreme offense of malfeasance, it gave\r\na firmer hold to a Ring actuated by the resolute determination to\r\nenrich itself at the public expense.\r\n\r\nYet this measure encountered little opposition. The Young Democracy,\r\nbacked by Tilden and the remnant of the Albany Regency, exposed its\r\ndangerous features, the _Times_ called it an \"abominable\r\ncharter,\"[1235] and Manton Marble bitterly denounced it. But Tweed\r\nraised no flag of truce, and after the distribution of a million of\r\ndollars the Sweeny charter had an easy passage through both houses,\r\nthe Senate recording but two votes against it and the Assembly only\r\nfive.[1236] It was said that five Republican senators received $40,000\r\neach, and six others $10,000 each. Six hundred thousand went to a\r\nlobbyist to buy assemblymen.[1237] Within three days after its passage\r\n(April 5) the Governor had approved it, the Mayor had appointed Tweed\r\nto the position of most power, and Sweeny had taken the place of most\r\nlucre. Thereafter, as commissioner of public works, the Boss was to be\r\n\"the bold burglar,\" and his silent partner \"the dark plotter.\" A week\r\nlater the departments of police and health, the office of comptroller,\r\nthe park commission, and the great law bureau had passed into the\r\ncontrol of their pals, with Connolly as \"sneak-thief\" and Hall \"the\r\ndashing bandit of the gang.\"[1238] Indeed, a month had scarcely elapsed\r\nbefore the _ad interim_ Board of Audit, authorised by the Legislature\r\nas an additional scheme for theft, and composed of Tweed, Hall, and\r\nConnolly, had ordered the payment of $6,000,000, and within the year,\r\nas subsequent revelations disclosed, its bills aggregated $12,250,000,\r\nof which 66 per cent. went to the thieves.[1239]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1235: New York _Times_, March 25, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1236: The Tweed Case, 1876, Vol. 2, p. 1212.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1237: Document No. 8, pp. 84-92; Gustavus Myers, _History of\r\nTammany Hall_, p. 272; James F. Rhodes, _History of the United\r\nStates_, Vol. 6, p. 395; New York _Tribune_, September 17, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1238: Albert B. Paine, _Life of Thomas Nast_, p. 143.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1239: John Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 2, p. 185.]\r\n\r\nJohn T. Hoffman approved Tweed's measures. During the earlier months\r\nof his gubernatorial career his veto of several bills granting aid to\r\nrailroads gave promise of independence, but after Tweed and Sweeny\r\nbecame directors of the Erie he approved the measure enabling corrupt\r\noperators to retain possession of the road for an indefinite period in\r\ndefiance of the stockholders. It is probable that the real character\r\nand fatal tendency of his associates had not been revealed to him.\r\nNevertheless, ambition seems to have blunted a strong, alert mind. The\r\nappointment of Ingraham, Cardozo, and Barnard to the General Term of\r\nthe Supreme Court within the city of New York, if further evidence\r\nwere needed, revealed the Governor's subserviency. To avoid the Tweed\r\njudges as well as interruption to the business of the Courts, the Bar\r\nAssociation asked the Executive to designate outside judges. Tweed\r\nunderstood the real object, and before the lawyers' committee,\r\nconsisting of Charles O'Conor, Joseph H. Choate, Henry Nicoll, William\r\nH. Peckham, and William E. Curtis, could reach Albany, the Governor,\r\nunder telegraphic instructions from the Boss, appointed the notorious\r\ntrio. Such revelations of weakness plunged the _Evening Post_ and\r\nother admirers into tribulation. \"The moral of Hoffman's fall,\" said\r\nthe _Nation_, \"is that respectable citizens must give up the notion\r\nthat good can be accomplished by patting anybody on the back who,\r\nhaving got by accident or intrigue into high official position, treats\r\nthem to a few spasms of virtue and independence.... Had Hoffman held\r\nout against the Erie Ring he would have had no chance of renomination,\r\nall hope of the Presidency would be gone, and he would find himself\r\nostracised by his Democratic associates.\"[1240]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1240: The _Nation_, May 27, 1869.]\r\n\r\nHoffman knew this as well as the _Nation_, and his obedience made him\r\nthe favourite of the Democratic State convention which assembled at\r\nRochester on September 21, 1870. It was a Tweed body. When he nodded\r\nthe delegates became unanimous. Tilden called it to order and had his\r\npocket picked by a gentleman in attendance.[1241] \"We hope he has a\r\nrealising sense of the company he keeps,\" said the _Nation_, \"when he\r\nopens conventions for Mr. Tweed, Mr. Hall, and Mr. Sweeny.\"[1242] A\r\nweek later it expressed the opinion that \"Tilden's appearance ought to\r\nbe the last exhibition the country is to witness of the alliance of\r\ndecent men for any purpose with these wretched thieves and\r\nswindlers.\"[1243] The plundering Boss denied so much as a hearing to\r\nthe Young Democracy whom Tilden encouraged, while their delegates,\r\nwithout vote or voice or seat, witnessed the renomination of Hoffman\r\nby acclamation, and saw the programme, drafted by Tweed, executed with\r\nunanimity. Mighty was Tammany, and, mightier still, its Tweed! The\r\nRochester authorities urged the departure of the delegates before\r\ndark, and upon their arrival at Jersey City the next morning the local\r\npolice made indiscriminate arrests and locked up large batches of\r\nthem, including a Commissioner of Charities and Correction.[1244]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1241: The _Nation_, September 29, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1242: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1243: _Ibid._, October 6.\r\n\r\nThe following officials were nominated by acclamation: Governor, John\r\nT. Hoffman; Lieutenant-Governor, Allen C. Beach; Comptroller, Asher P.\r\nNichols; Canal Commissioners, John D. Fay and George W. Chapman;\r\nPrison Inspector, Solomon E. Scheu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1244: The _Nation_, September 29.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCONKLING DEFEATS FENTON\r\n\r\n1870\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Republican State convention which assembled at Saratoga on\r\nSeptember 7 was not so harmonious as the Tammany body. For several\r\nyears Senator Morgan and Governor Fenton had represented the two\r\nsections of the party, the latter, soon after his inauguration on\r\nJanuary 1, 1865, having commenced building his political machine. As\r\nan organiser he had few equals. One writer declares him \"the ablest\r\nafter Van Buren.\"[1245] At all events he soon became the head of the\r\nparty, controlling its conventions and distributing its patronage.\r\nAfter entering the Senate he paid assiduous attention to the\r\nPresident. The repeal of the Tenure-of-Office Act and an effort to\r\nsecure the confirmation of Alexander T. Stewart for secretary of the\r\ntreasury opened the way to Grant's heart, and for these and other\r\nfavours he received the lion's share of appointments. In the meantime\r\nhis opponents insisted that under cover of loud radical professions he\r\nhad relied wholly upon trickery for success, banning able men and\r\ndemoralising the party.[1246]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1245: Charles E. Fitch, formerly editor of the Rochester\r\n_Democrat-Chronicle_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1246: _Harper's Weekly_, June 24, 1871.]\r\n\r\nTo these criticisms and Conkling's advances the President presented a\r\nlistening ear. Conkling had not thrust himself upon Grant, but the\r\nmore the President tired of Fenton's importunities, the more he liked\r\nConkling's wit and sarcasm and forceful speech. As patronage gradually\r\ndisappeared Fenton redoubled his efforts to retain it, until in his\r\ndesperation he addressed a letter to the Chief Executive, referring to\r\nhis own presidential aspirations, and offering to withdraw and give\r\nhim New York if the question of offices could be satisfactorily\r\narranged.[1247] This ended their relations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1247: Conkling's speech, New York _Times_, July 24, 1872.]\r\n\r\nSubsequent appointments, however, did not meet with more favour.\r\nFenton declared them fatal to party harmony, since some of the new\r\nofficials, besides holding confidential relations with Tammany, had\r\nbeen friendly to the Philadelphia movement in 1866 and to Hoffman in\r\n1868. Bitter criticism especially followed the nomination of Thomas\r\nMurphy for collector of New York in place of Moses H. Grinnell. \"The\r\nPresident appointed Murphy without consulting either Senator,\" says\r\nStewart, for thirty years a senator from Nevada. \"Grant met him at\r\nLong Branch, and being thoroughly acquainted with the country and\r\nquite a horseman he made himself such a serviceable friend that the\r\nChief Executive thought him a fit person for collector.\"[1248] The New\r\nYork _Times_ said, \"the President has taken a step which all his\r\nenemies will exult over and his friends deplore.\"[1249] The _Tribune_\r\nwas more severe. \"The objection is not that he belongs to a particular\r\nwing of the Republican party,\" it said, \"but that he does not honestly\r\nbelong to any; that his political record is one of treachery well\r\nrewarded; his business record such that the merchants of New York have\r\nno confidence in him; and the record of his relations to the\r\ngovernment such that, until cleared up, he ought to hold no place of\r\ntrust under it.\"[1250] Yet Murphy bore endorsements from men of the\r\nhighest respectability. \"Of those who in writing recommended his\r\nappointment or confirmation,\" said Conkling, \"are Edwin D. Morgan,\r\nGeorge Opdyke, Henry Clews, John A. Griswold, Charles J. Folger,\r\nMatthew Hale, George Dawson, and others. Their signatures are in my\r\npossession.\"[1251]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1248: William M. Stewart, _Reminiscences_, p. 255.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1249: June 17, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1250: September 19, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1251: New York _Times_, July 24, 1872.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Conkling preferred another, and until urged by his\r\nfriend Stewart to secure Murphy's confirmation \"to avoid the possible\r\nappointment of a less deserving man,\" he hesitated to act. \"I told him\r\nthat the struggle to confirm Murphy would enlighten the President as\r\nto the political situation in New York, and that he would undoubtedly\r\naccord him the influence to which he was entitled. Then, to force the\r\nfight, Conkling, at my suggestion, objected to further postponement.\"[1252]\r\nThe contest came on July 11, 1870.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1252: Stewart, _Reminiscences_, pp. 255-256.]\r\n\r\nFenton recalled Murphy's malodorous army contracts, spoke of his\r\ndisloyalty to the party while a member of the State Senate, submitted\r\nproof of his unscrupulous business relations with the leaders of\r\nTammany, and denounced his political treachery in the gubernatorial\r\ncontest of 1866. In this fierce three hours' arraignment the Senator\r\nspared no one. He charged that Charles J. Folger and Chester A. Arthur\r\nhad appeared in Washington in Murphy's behalf, because to the latter's\r\npotent and corrupt influence with Tammany, Folger owed his election to\r\nthe Court of Appeals in the preceding May,[1253] while Arthur, through\r\nMurphy's unclean bargaining with Tweed, was fattening as counsel for\r\nthe New York City Tax Commission.[1254]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1253: Under the provisions of the new judiciary article of\r\nthe Constitution a chief justice and six associate justices of the\r\nCourt of Appeals were elected on May 17, 1870, each party being\r\nallowed to put up only four candidates for associate justices. To\r\ncomplete their ticket the Democrats selected Folger and Andrews, two\r\nof the four Republican candidates. The election resulted in the choice\r\nof the Democratic ticket.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1254: New York _Times_, July 12, 1870.]\r\n\r\nIn his reply Conkling spoke for an hour in his most vigorous style.\r\n\"Every sentence,\" said Stewart, \"was replete with logic, sarcasm,\r\nreason, and invective. Sometimes the senators would rise to their\r\nfeet, so great was the effect upon them. Toward the conclusion of his\r\nspeech Conkling walked down the aisle to a point opposite the seat of\r\nFenton. 'It is true,' he said, 'that Thomas Murphy is a mechanic, a\r\nhatter by trade; that he worked at his trade in Albany supporting an\r\naged father and mother and crippled brother, and that while thus\r\nengaged another visited Albany and played a very different rôle.' At\r\nthis point he drew from his pocket a court record, and extending it\r\ntoward Fenton, he continued,--'the particulars of which I will not\r\nrelate except at the special request of my colleague.' Fenton's head\r\ndropped upon his desk as if struck down with a club. The scene in the\r\nSenate was tragic.\"[1255]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1255: Stewart, _Reminiscences_, pp. 256-7.\r\n\r\n\"In early life Fenton, having undertaken to carry $12,000 to Albany,\r\nreported the money lost. He was arrested and discharged after much\r\ntestimony was taken. Whether accused justly or unjustly (most persons\r\nthought unjustly) it blurred his career. Conkling had a copy of the\r\nproceedings before the criminal court.\"--_Ibid._ See also _The\r\nNation_, July 14, 1870.]\r\n\r\nIt was a desperate battle. For several weeks heated politicians, with\r\npockets full of affidavits, had hurried to Washington from all parts\r\nof New York, and while it was admitted that the appointee was not a\r\nshining credit to his backers, the belief obtained that the control of\r\nthe party in the State depended upon the result. The two Senators so\r\nunderstood it, and their preparation for the contest omitted all\r\namenities. Fenton, regardless of whom he hit, relied upon carefully\r\ndrawn charges sustained by affidavits; Conkling trusted to a fire of\r\nscathing sarcasm, supported by personal influence with his Democratic\r\ncolleagues and the President's power in his own party. The result\r\nshowed the senior Senator's shrewdness, for when he ceased talking the\r\nSenate, by a vote of 48 to 3, confirmed the appointment.\r\n\r\nFrom Washington the contest was transferred to Saratoga. Fenton,\r\ndesiring to impress and coerce the appointing power, made a herculean\r\neffort to show that although Conkling had the ear of the President, he\r\ncould control the convention, and his plan included the election of\r\nCharles H. Van Wyck for temporary chairman and himself for permanent\r\npresident. No doubt existed that at this moment he possessed great\r\npower. Delegates crowded his headquarters, and a score of lieutenants\r\nreported him far in the lead. From Fenton's accession to the\r\ngovernorship a majority of the State Committee had supported him,\r\nwhile chairmen, secretaries, and inspectors of the Republican district\r\norganisations in New York City, many of whom held municipal\r\nappointments under Tweed, had been welded together in the interest of\r\nthe Chautauquan's ascendency. To try to break such a combine was\r\nalmost attempting the impossible. Indeed, until the President, in a\r\nletter dated August 22, expressed the wish that Conkling might go as a\r\ndelegate, the Senator had hesitated to attend the convention.[1256]\r\nEven on the eve of its meeting he counselled with friends on the\r\npolicy of not taking his seat, while his backers talked of harmony and\r\nproposed George William Curtis for chairman. The confident Fenton,\r\nhaving retired for the night, would listen to no compromise. Meanwhile\r\nthe senior Senator, accompanied by Thomas Murphy, visited the rooms of\r\nthe up-State delegates, telling them that a vote for Fenton was a blow\r\nat the Administration.[1257] This was the argument of desperation. It\r\nmeant to one man the loss of a federal office and to another the hope\r\nthat one might be gained. Such a significant statement, addressed by\r\nthe favourite of the President to internal revenue and post-office\r\nofficials, naturally demoralised the Fenton ranks, and when the\r\nconvention acted Curtis had 220 votes to 150 for Van Wyck.[1258]\r\nPromptly upon this announcement Conkling, with great cunning, as if\r\nacting the part of a peacemaker, moved that the committee on\r\norganisation report Van Wyck for permanent president. The acceptance\r\nof this suggestion without dissent settled Fenton, who an hour later\r\nheard Conkling named at the head and himself at the foot of the\r\ncommittee on resolutions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1256: A.R. Conkling, _Life of Roscoe Conkling_, p. 328. New\r\nYork _World_, September 8, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1257: The _Nation_, September 15, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1258: \"During the vote the delegates commenced a system of\r\ncheering, first for Conkling, then for Fenton. Senator Conkling was\r\nvery conspicuous throughout the balloting. His friends gathered around\r\nhim, while the other side surrounded Fenton, and whenever either moved\r\ntheir friends cheered.... Had there been a secret ballot Fenton would\r\nhave won in spite of the threats and bribes.\"--New York _World_,\r\nSeptember 8, 1870.]\r\n\r\nThus far Conkling's success had been as unexpected as it was dazzling.\r\nHeretofore he had been in office but not in power. Now for the first\r\ntime he had a strong majority behind him. He could do as he liked. He\r\npossessed the confidence of the President, the devotion of his\r\nfollowers, and the admiration of his opponents, who watched his\r\ntactics in the selection of a candidate for governor with deepest\r\ninterest. It was a harrowing situation. For several weeks Horace\r\nGreeley had been the principal candidate talked of, and although the\r\neditor himself did not \"counsel or advise\" his nomination, he admitted\r\nthat \"he would feel gratified if the convention should deliberately\r\nadjudge him the strongest candidate.\"[1259] Several circumstances added\r\nto his strength. Conkling had encouraged his candidacy to checkmate\r\nFenton's support of Marshall O. Roberts. For this reason the President\r\nalso favoured him. Besides, Stewart L. Woodford, who really expected\r\nlittle, offered to withdraw if Greeley desired it,[1260] while DeWitt\r\nC. Littlejohn, always a Titan in the political arena, likewise\r\nside-stepped. These influences, as Conkling intended, silenced Fenton\r\nand suppressed Roberts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1259: New York _Tribune_, August 27, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1260: _Ibid._, September 8.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Greeley's old-time enemies had not disappeared. No\r\none really liked him,[1261] while party managers, the shadow of whose\r\nill-will never ceased to obscure his chances, shook their heads.\r\nReasons given in 1868 were repeated with greater emphasis, and to\r\nprevent his nomination which now seemed imminent, influences that had\r\nsuddenly made him strong were as quickly withdrawn. It was intimated\r\nthat the President preferred Woodford, and to defeat Fenton's possible\r\nrally to Roberts use was again made of Curtis. The latter did not ask\r\nsuch preferment, but Conkling, who had made him chairman, promised him\r\nthe governorship and Curtis being human acquiesced. In the fierce\r\nencounter, however, this strategy, as questionable as it was sudden,\r\ndestroyed Greeley, humiliated Curtis, and nominated Woodford.[1262]\r\nConkling's tactics neither commended his judgment nor flattered his\r\nleadership. But Conkling did not then possess the nerve openly to make\r\nwar upon Greeley. On the contrary, after secretly informing his\r\nlieutenants of his preference for Curtis, he dodged the vote on the\r\nfirst ballot and supported Greeley on the second, thus throwing his\r\nfriends into confusion. To extricate them from disorder he sought an\r\nadjournment, while Fenton, very adroitly preventing such an excursion\r\nto the repair-shop, forced the convention to support Woodford or\r\naccept Greeley. The feeling obtained that Conkling had lost the\r\nprestige of his early victory, but in securing control of the State\r\nCommittee he began the dictatorship that was destined to continue for\r\neleven years.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1261: Edward Cary, _Life of George William Curtis_, p. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1262: Three ballots were cast as follows:\r\n\r\nWoodford    153          170-1/2      258\r\nGreeley     143          139          105-1/2\r\nCurtis      104-1/2       87-1/2       20\r\n            -------      -------      -------\r\nTotal       390-1/2      397          383-1/2\r\n\r\nThe following ticket was nominated: Governor, Stewart L. Woodford,\r\nKings; Lieutenant-Governor, Sigmund Kaufman, Kings; Comptroller, Abiah\r\nW. Palmer, Dutchess; Canal Commissioners, Absalom Nelson, Erie;\r\nAlexander Barkley, Washington; Prison Inspector, John Parkhurst,\r\nClinton.]\r\n\r\nThe New York _Times_ charged Greeley's defeat upon Fenton, insisting\r\nthat \"the fault is not to be laid at the door of Senator\r\nConkling.\"[1263] Conkling also explained that \"Greeley was\r\npertinaciously supported by all those connected with the custom-house.\r\nHe failed from a want of confidence in him, so general among the\r\ndelegates that electioneering and persuasion could not prevail against\r\nit, and even those who voted for him declared, in many instances, that\r\nthey did so as a harmless compliment, knowing that he could not be\r\nnominated.\"[1264] Greeley himself avoided the controversy, but his\r\nacknowledgment of Fenton's loyal support and his sharp censure of\r\nCurtis indicated full knowledge of Conkling's strategy, to whom,\r\nhowever, he imputed no \"bad faith,\" since \"his aid had not been\r\nsolicited and none promised.\"[1265] Nevertheless, the great editor did\r\nnot forget!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1263: September 10 and 14, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1264: From speech of July 23, 1872, New York _Times_, July\r\n24, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1265: New York _Tribune_, September 13, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTWEED WINS AND FALLS\r\n\r\n1870\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaign that followed the control of Tweed and Conkling combined\r\nthe spectacular and the dramatic. The platform of each party was\r\ncatchy. Both congratulated Germany for its victories and France for\r\nits republic. Cuba also was remembered. But here the likeness ceased.\r\nDemocrats praised Hoffman, arraigned Grant, sympathised with Ireland,\r\ndemanded the release of Fenian raiders and the abolition of vexatious\r\ntaxes, declared the system of protection a robbery, and resolved that\r\na license law was more favourable to temperance than prohibition. On\r\nthe other hand, Republicans praised the President, arraigned the\r\nGovernor, applauded payments on the national debt and the reduction of\r\ntaxation, denounced election frauds and subventions to sectarian\r\nschools, and resolved that so long as towns and cities have the right\r\nto license the sale of liquor, they should also have the right to\r\nprohibit its sale. The live issue, however, was Tammany and the Tweed\r\nfrauds. Congress had authorised Circuit Courts of the United States to\r\nappoint in every election district one person from each party to watch\r\nthe registration and the casting and the count of votes. It had also\r\nempowered United States marshals to appoint deputies to keep order at\r\nthe polls and to arrest for offences committed in their presence.\r\nAgainst these acts the Democrats vigorously protested, declaring them\r\nunconstitutional, revolutionary, and another step toward\r\ncentralisation, while Republicans pointed out their necessity in the\r\ninterest of a fair vote and an honest count.\r\n\r\nTo Conkling the result of the campaign was of the utmost importance.\r\nHe had suddenly come into power, and success would materially aid him\r\nin carrying out his policy of reorganising the party in the\r\nmetropolis. For many years, under an arrangement with Tammany,\r\nRepublicans had held important municipal positions. This custom had\r\ngrown out of the appointment of mixed commissions, created by\r\nRepublican legislatures, which divided the patronage between the two\r\nparties. But since 1865, under Fenton's skilful manipulation, these\r\nTammany-Republicans, as they were called, had become the ardent\r\npromoters of the Fenton machine, holding places on the general and\r\ndistrict committees, carrying primaries with the aid of Democratic\r\nvotes, and resorting to methods which fair-minded men did not approve.\r\nAmong other things it was charged that Fenton himself had a secret\r\nunderstanding with Democratic leaders.[1266] These rumours had aroused\r\nthe suspicions of many Republicans, who thought it time to dissolve\r\nthe Tammany partnership, and having obtained control of the State\r\nCommittee in the late convention, Conkling proposed to reorganise the\r\nNew York general committee. Fenton was not unmindful of Conkling's\r\npurpose. It had been disclosed in the convention, and to defeat it the\r\nChautauquan was indifferent to ways and means. During much of the\r\ncampaign he absented himself from the State, while threats of avenging\r\nthe appointment of Murphy and the removal of Grinnell created the\r\napprehension that his faction would secretly oppose the ticket.[1267]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1266: A.R. Conkling, _Life of Roscoe Conkling_, p. 329.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1267: \"Governor Fenton and his friends were lukewarm\r\nthroughout the campaign, the Governor absenting himself from the State\r\nmuch of the time. Late in October he returned from the Western States,\r\nand on the 31st, five days before election, he made a speech.\" From\r\nConkling's speech of July 22, 1872. New York _Times_, July 24.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the canvass Conkling was energetic. He spoke frequently.\r\nThat his temper was hot no one who looked at him could doubt, but he\r\nhad it in tight control. Although he encountered unfriendly\r\ndemonstrations, especially in New York, the pettiness of ruffled\r\nvanity did not appear. Nothing could be more easy and graceful than\r\nhis manner on these occasions. His expository statements, lucid,\r\nsmooth, and equally free from monotony and abruptness, were models of\r\ntheir kind. In dealing with election frauds in New York his\r\nutterances, without growing more vehement or higher keyed, found\r\nexpression in the fire of his eye and the resistless strength of his\r\nwords. The proud, bold nature of the man seemed to flash out,\r\nstartling and thrilling the hearer by the power of his towering\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nRevelations of fraud had been strengthened by the publication of the\r\nEighth Census. In many election districts it appeared that the count\r\nwas three, four, five, and even six times as large as an honest vote\r\ncould be. Proofs existed, including in some instances a confession,\r\nthat in 1868 the same men registered more than one hundred times under\r\ndifferent names--one man one hundred and twenty-seven times. Instances\r\nwere known and admitted in which the same man on the same day voted\r\nmore than twenty times for John T. Hoffman. \"To perpetuate this\r\ninfamy,\" declared Conkling, \"Mayor Hall has invented since the\r\npublication of the census new escapes for repeaters by changing the\r\nnumbers and the boundaries of most of the election districts, in some\r\ncases bisecting blocks and buildings, so that rooms on the same\r\npremises are in different districts, thus enabling colonised repeaters\r\nto register and vote often, and to find doors of escape left open by\r\nofficials who have sworn to keep them closed.\" The registration for\r\n1870, although twenty thousand less than in 1868, he declared,\r\ncontained seventeen thousand known fraudulent entries.[1268] The\r\nnewspapers strengthened his arguments. In one of Nast's cartoons Tweed\r\nas \"Falstaff\" reviews his army of repeaters, with Hoffman as\r\nsword-bearer, and Comptroller Sweeny, Mayor Hall, James Fisk, Jr., and\r\nJay Gould as spectators.[1269] Another pre-election cartoon, entitled\r\n\"The Power behind the Throne,\" presented Governor Hoffman crowned and\r\nrobed as king, with Tweed grasping the sword of power and Sweeny the\r\naxe of an headsman.[1270]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1268: New York _Times_, November 7, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1269: _Harper's Weekly_, November 5, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1270: _Harper's Weekly_, October 29, 1870.]\r\n\r\nDemocrats resented these attacks. People, still indifferent to or\r\nignorant of Tweed's misdeeds, rested undisturbed. The Citizens'\r\nAssociation of New York had memorialised the Legislature to pass the\r\nTweed charter, men of wealth and character petitioned for its\r\nadoption, and the press in the main approved it.[1271] Even the\r\n_World_, after its bitter attacks in the preceding winter upon the\r\nRing officials, championed their cause.[1272] \"There is not another\r\nmunicipal government in the world,\" said Manton Marble, \"which\r\ncombines so much character, capacity, experience, and energy as are to\r\nbe found in the city government of New York under the new\r\ncharter.\"[1273] The final Democratic rally of the campaign also\r\ncontributed to Tammany's glory. Horatio Seymour was the guest of honor\r\nand August Belmont chairman. Conspicuous in the list of\r\nvice-presidents were Samuel J. Tilden, George Tichnor Curtis, Augustus\r\nSchell, and Charles O'Conor, while Tweed, with Hoffman and McClellan,\r\nreviewed thirty thousand marchers in the presence of one hundred\r\nthousand people who thronged Union Square, attracted by an\r\nentertainment as lavish as the fêtes of Napoleon III. To many this\r\nprodigal expenditure of money suggested as complete and sudden a\r\ncollapse to Tweed as had befallen the French Emperor, then about to\r\nbecome the prisoner of Germany. In the midst of the noise Seymour,\r\nrefraining from committing himself to Tammany's methods, read a\r\ncarefully written essay on the canals.[1274] It was noted, too, that\r\nTilden did not speak.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1271: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1870, pp. 543, 544; Frank J.\r\nGoodnow in Bryce's _American Commonwealth_, Vol. 1, p. 342.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1272: New York _World_, March 29, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1273: _Ibid._, June 13, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1274: _Ibid._, Oct. 28, 1870.]\r\n\r\nThe election resulted in the choice of all the Democratic candidates,\r\nwith sixteen of the thirty-one congressmen and a majority in each\r\nbranch of the Legislature. Hall was also re-elected mayor.[1275]\r\nRepublicans extracted a bit of comfort out of the reduced majority in\r\nNew York City, but to all appearances Tammany had tightened its grip.\r\nIndeed, on New Year's Day, 1871, when Hoffman and Hall, with almost\r\nunlimited patronage to divide, were installed for a second time, the\r\nBoss had reason to feel that he could do as he liked. From a modest\r\nhouse on Henry Street he moved to Fifth Avenue. At his summer home in\r\nGreenwich he erected a stable with stalls of finest mahogany. His\r\ndaughter's wedding became a prodigal exhibition of great wealth, and\r\nadmittance to the Americus Club, his favourite retreat, required an\r\ninitiation fee of one thousand dollars. To the poor he gave lavishly.\r\nIn the winter of 1870-71 he donated one thousand dollars to each\r\nalderman to buy coal and food for the needy. His own ward received\r\nfifty thousand. Finally, in return for his gifts scattered broadcast\r\nto the press and to an army of protégés, it was proposed to erect a\r\nstatue \"in commemoration of his services to the Commonwealth of New\r\nYork.\" His followers thought him invulnerable, and those who despised\r\nhim feared his power. In New York he had come to occupy something of\r\nthe position formerly accorded to Napoleon III by the public opinion\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1275: Hoffman over Woodford, 33,096. James S. Graham, Labor\r\nReform candidate, received 1,907 votes, and Myron H. Clark, Temperance\r\ncandidate, 1,459 votes. Assembly, 65 Democrats to 63 Republicans;\r\nSenate, 17 Democrats to 14 Republicans. Hall's majority, 23,811.\r\nHoffman's majority in New York City, 52,037, being 16,000 less than in\r\n1868. Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1870, p. 547.]\r\n\r\nTweed's legislative achievements, increasing in boldness, climaxed in\r\nthe session of 1871 by the passage of the Acts to widen Broadway and\r\nconstruct the Viaduct Railroad. The latter company had power to grade\r\nstreets, to sell five millions of its stock to the municipality, and\r\nto have its property exempted from taxation,[1276] while the Broadway\r\nswindle, estimated to cost the city between fifty and sixty\r\nmillions,[1277] enabled members of the Ring to enrich themselves in the\r\npurchase of real estate. To pass these measures Tweed required the\r\nentire Democratic vote, so that when one member resigned to avoid\r\nexpulsion for having assaulted a colleague,[1278] he found it necessary\r\nto purchase a Republican to break the deadlock. The character of\r\nRepublican assemblymen had materially changed for the better, and the\r\nbelief obtained that \"none would be brazen enough to take the risk of\r\nselling out;\"[1279] but an offer of seventy-five thousand dollars\r\nsecured the needed vote.[1280] Thus did the power of evil seem more\r\nstrongly intrenched than ever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1276: Myers, _History of Tammany_, p. 276.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1277: Myers, _History of Tammany_, p. 276.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1278: Without provocation James Irving of New York assaulted\r\nSmith M. Weed of Clinton.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1279: New York _Tribune_, April 14, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1280: \"Winans was unfortunate in his bargain, for after\r\nrendering the service agreed upon Tweed gave him only one-tenth of the\r\nsum promised.\" Myers' _History of Tammany Hall_, p. 277. It might be\r\nadded that Winans' wife left him, and that the contempt of his\r\nneighbours drove him from home. A rumour that he subsequently\r\ncommitted suicide remains unverified.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the constant and unsparing denunciation of the New York\r\n_Times_, coupled with Nast's cartoons in _Harper's Weekly_, excited\r\nincreasing attention to the Ring. As early as 1869 Nast began\r\nsatirising the partnership of Tweed, Sweeny, Connolly, and Hall, and\r\nin 1870 the _Times_ opened its battery with an energy and sureness of\r\naim that greatly disturbed the conspirators. To silence its suggestive\r\nand relentless attacks Tweed sought to bribe its editor, making an\r\noffer of one million dollars.[1281] A little later he sent word to Nast\r\nthat he could have half a million.[1282] Failing in these attempts the\r\nRing, in November, 1870, secured an indorsement from Marshall O.\r\nRoberts, Moses Taylor, John Jacob Astor, and three others of like\r\nposition, that the financial affairs of the city, as shown by the\r\ncomptroller's books, were administered correctly. It subsequently\r\ntranspired that some of these men were associated with Tweed in the\r\nnotorious Viaduct job,[1283] but for the time their certificate\r\nre-established the Ring's credit more firmly than ever. \"There is\r\nabsolutely nothing in the city,\" said the _Times_, \"which is beyond\r\nthe reach of the insatiable gang who have obtained possession of\r\nit.\"[1284]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1281: Paine, _Life of Nast_, p. 153.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1282: _Ibid._, p. 182.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1283: Paine, _Life of Nast_, p. 145.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1284: February 24, 1871.]\r\n\r\nWhile Roberts and his associates were certifying to the correctness of\r\nConnolly's books, William Copeland, a clerk in the office, was making\r\na transcript of the Ring's fraudulent disbursements. Copeland was a\r\nprotégé of ex-sheriff James O'Brien, who had quarrelled with Connolly\r\nbecause the latter refused to allow his exorbitant bills, and with the\r\nCopeland transcript he tried to extort the money from Tweed. Failing\r\nin this he offered the evidence to the _Times_. A little later the\r\nsame journal obtained a transcript of fraudulent armoury accounts\r\nthrough Matthew J. O'Rourke, a county bookkeeper. When knowledge of\r\nthe _Times'_ possessions reached the Ring, Connolly offered George\r\nJones, the proprietor, five million dollars to keep silent. \"I cannot\r\nconsider your proposition,\" said Jones.[1285]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1285: _Harper's Weekly_, February 22, 1890; Paine, _Life of\r\nNast_, p. 170.]\r\n\r\nThe _Times'_ publication of the armoury expenses furnished by O'Rourke\r\ncreated a sensation, but the excitement over the Copeland evidence\r\ngrew into a fierce tempest. These figures, carefully tabulated and\r\nprinted in large type, showed that the new courthouse, incomplete and\r\nmiserably furnished, involved a steal of $8,000,000. One plasterer\r\nreceived $38,187 for two days' work. Another, during a part of two\r\nmonths, drew nearly $1,000,000. A carpenter received $350,000 for a\r\nmonth's labour. A single item of stationery aggregated $186,495, while\r\nforty chairs and three tables cost $179,729. In supplying aldermen\r\nwith carriages, mostly for funerals, two liverymen earned $50,000 in a\r\nfew days. Advertising in city newspapers amounted to $2,703,308.\r\nCarpets purchased at five dollars per yard would cover City Hall Park\r\nthree times over. As these disclosures appeared in successive issues\r\nthe people realised that a gang of very common thieves had been at\r\nwork. It was a favourite method to refuse payment for want of money\r\nuntil a claimant, weary of waiting, accepted the suggestion of\r\nConnolly's agent to increase the amount of his bill. This turned an\r\nhonest man into a conspirator and gave the Ring the benefit of the\r\nraise.[1286]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1286: New York _Times_, July 21, 1871.]\r\n\r\nOn September 4, 1871, a mass meeting of indignant citizens, held in\r\nCooper Union, created the Committee of Seventy, and charged it with\r\nthe conduct of investigations and prosecutions. Before it could act\r\nvouchers and cancelled warrants, covering the courthouse work for 1869\r\nand 1870, had been stolen from the comptroller's office.[1287] This\r\nincreased the excitement. At last Connolly, to escape becoming a\r\nscape-goat, appointed Andrew H. Green deputy comptroller, and the\r\nGovernor designated Charles O'Conor to act in behalf of the\r\nAttorney-General. Thus the Committee of Seventy passed into complete\r\ncontrol of the situation, and under the pressure of suits and arrests\r\nthe Ring rapidly lost its power and finally its existence. On October\r\n26, 1871, Tweed was arrested and held to bail in the sum of\r\n$1,000,000, Jay Gould becoming his chief bondsman. Soon after Sweeny\r\nretired from the Board of Park Commissioners, Connolly resigned as\r\ncomptroller, and Tweed gave up the offices of grand sachem of Tammany,\r\ndirector of the Erie Railway, and commissioner of public works. Of all\r\nhis associates Mayor Hall alone continued in office, serving until the\r\nend of 1872, the close of his term.[1288]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1287: Subsequently the charred remains of these accounts were\r\ndiscovered in an ash-heap in the City Hall attic. Myers, _History of\r\nTammany Hall_, p. 387.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1288: Hall was indicted and tried, but the jury disagreed.\r\nThe second grand jury did not indict.]\r\n\r\nHaving anticipated a little it may not be improper to anticipate a\r\nlittle more, and say what became of other members of this historic\r\nRing. When the public prosecutor began his work Sweeny and Connolly\r\nfled to Europe.[1289] After one mistrial, Tweed, found guilty on\r\nfifty-one counts, was sent to prison for twelve years on Blackwell's\r\nIsland, but at the end of a year the Court of Appeals reversed the\r\nsentence, holding it cumulative. Being immediately rearrested Tweed,\r\nin default of bail fixed at $3,000,000, remained in jail until his\r\nescape in December, 1875. Disguised by cutting his beard and wearing a\r\nwig and gold spectacles, he concealed his whereabouts for nearly a\r\nyear, going to Florida in a schooner, thence to Cuba in a fishing\r\nsmack, and finally to Spain, where he was recognised and returned to\r\nNew York on a United States man-of-war. He re-entered confinement on\r\nNovember 23, 1876, and died friendless and moneyless in Ludlow Street\r\njail on April 12, 1878.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1289: Sweeny afterwards compromised for $400,000 and returned\r\nto New York. Connolly, who was reported to have taken away $6,000,000,\r\ndied abroad.]\r\n\r\nMeantime the Legislature of 1871 had ordered the impeachment of\r\nBarnard and Cardozo of the Supreme Court, and McCunn of the Superior\r\nCourt. Their offences extended beyond the sphere of Tweed's\r\noperations, indicating the greed of a Sweeny and the disregard of all\r\nhonorable obligations. Cardozo, the most infamous of the trio, called\r\nthe Machiavelli of the Bench, weakened under investigation and\r\nresigned to avoid dismissal. Barnard and McCunn, being summarily\r\nremoved, were forever disqualified from holding any office of trust in\r\nthe State. McCunn died three days after sentence, while Barnard,\r\nalthough living for seven years, went to his grave at the early age of\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of the Ring's gigantic swindles is known only\r\napproximately. Henry F. Taintor, the auditor employed by Andrew H.\r\nGreen, estimated it between forty-five and fifty millions; an\r\nAldermanic committee placed it at sixty millions; and Matthew J.\r\nO'Rourke, after thorough study, fixed it at seventy-five millions,\r\nadding that if his report had included the vast issues of fraudulent\r\nbonds, the swindling by franchises and favours granted, and\r\npeculation by blackmail and extortion, the grand total would aggregate\r\ntwo hundred millions. Of the entire sum stolen only $876,000 were\r\nrecovered.[1290]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1290: Myers, _History of Tammany Hall_, pp. 297-298; New York\r\n_Herald_, January 13, 1901.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nCONKLING PUNISHES GREELEY\r\n\r\n1871\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It were idle,\" said Horace Greeley, soon after the election in\r\nNovember, 1870, \"to trace the genealogy of the feud which has divided\r\nRepublicans into what are of late designated Fenton and Conkling men.\r\nSuffice it that the fatal distraction exists and works inevitable\r\ndisaster. More effort was made in our last State convention to triumph\r\nover Senator Fenton than to defeat Governor Hoffman, and in selecting\r\ncandidates for our State ticket the question of Fenton and anti-Fenton\r\nwas more regarded by many than the nomination of strong and popular\r\ncandidates. Since then every Fenton man who holds a federal office has\r\nfelt of his neck each morning to be sure that his head was still\r\nattached to his shoulders.\"[1291]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1291: New York _Tribune_, November 10, 1870.]\r\n\r\nConkling's effort to obtain control of the State Committee provoked\r\nthis threnody. Subsequently, without the slightest warning, Fenton's\r\nnaval officer, general appraiser, and pension agent were removed.[1292]\r\nBut as the year grew older it became apparent that designs more fatal\r\nin their consequences than removals from office threatened the Fenton\r\norganisation. It was not a secret that the Governor had kept his\r\ncontrol largely through the management of politicians, entitled\r\n\"Tammany Republicans,\" of whom \"Hank\" Smith, as he was familiarly\r\ncalled, represented an active type. Smith was a member of the\r\nRepublican State committee and of the Republican general city\r\ncommittee. He was also a county supervisor and a Tweed police\r\ncommissioner. Moreover, he was the very model of a resourceful\r\nleader, acute and energetic, strong and unyielding, and utterly\r\nwithout timidity in politics. In supporting Fenton he appointed\r\nRepublicans to city offices, took care of those discharged from the\r\ncustom-house, and used the police and other instruments of power as\r\nfreely as Thomas Murphy created vacancies and made appointments.[1293]\r\nIn his despotic sway he had shown little regard for opposition leaders\r\nand none whatever for minorities, until at last a faction of the\r\ngeneral city committee, of which Horace Greeley was then chairman,\r\npetitioned the State committee for a reorganisation. So long as Fenton\r\ncontrolled State conventions and State committees, Smith's iron rule\r\neasily suppressed such seceders; but when the State committee revealed\r\na majority of Conkling men, with Cornell as chairman, these\r\nmalcontents found ready listeners and active sympathisers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1292: _Ibid._, April 4, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1293: \"Mr. Murphy's 'weeding out' process is exactly the one\r\nwhich the devil would use if he were appointed collector of this port,\r\nand that he would perform it on exactly the same principles and with\r\nthe same objects and results as Mr. Murphy performs it, we challenge\r\nany one to deny who is familiar with the devil's character and habits\r\nand Mr. Murphy's late doings.\"--_The Nation_, January 19, 1871.\r\n\r\n\"No collector was ever more destitute of fit qualifications for the\r\noffice.\" He made \"three hundred and thirty-eight removals every five\r\ndays during the eighteen months\" he held office. Report of D.B. Eaton,\r\nchairman of the Civil Service Commission, p. 23.]\r\n\r\nAlonzo B. Cornell, then thirty-nine years old, had already entered\r\nupon his famous career. From the time he began life as a boy of\r\nfifteen in an Erie Railroad telegraph office, he had achieved\r\nphenomenal success in business. His talents as an organiser easily\r\nopened the way. He became manager of the Western Union telegraph\r\nlines, the promoter of a steamboat company for Lake Cayuga, and the\r\ndirector of a national bank at Ithaca. Indeed, he forged ahead so\r\nrapidly that soon after leaving the employ of the Western Union, Jay\r\nGould charged him with manipulating a \"blind pool\" in telegraph\r\nstocks.[1294] His education and experience also made him an expert in\r\npolitical manipulation, until, in 1868, he shone as the Republican\r\ncandidate for lieutenant-governor. After his defeat and Grant's\r\nelection, he became surveyor of the port of New York, a supporter of\r\nConkling, and the champion of a second term for the President. His\r\nsilence, deepened by cold, dull eyes, justified the title of \"Sphinx,\"\r\nwhile his massive head, with bulging brows, indicated intellectual and\r\nexecutive power. He was not an educated man. Passing at an early age\r\nfrom his studies at Ithaca Academy into business no time was left him,\r\nif the disposition had been his, to specialise any branch of political\r\neconomic science. He could talk of politics and the rapid growth of\r\nAmerican industries, but the better government of great cities and the\r\nneed of reform in the national life found little if any place among\r\nhis activities. In fact, his close identification with the\r\norganisation had robbed him of the character that belongs to men of\r\npolitical independence, until the public came to regard him only an\r\noffice-holder who owed his position to the favour of a chief whom he\r\nloyally served.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1294: Stephen Fiske, _Off-Hand Portraits_, p. 58.]\r\n\r\nVery naturally the scheme of the malcontents attracted Cornell, who\r\nadvised Horace Greeley that after careful and patient consideration\r\nthe State Committee,[1295] by a vote of 20 to 8, had decided upon an\r\nentire reorganisation of his committee. Cornell further declared that\r\nif their action was without precedent so was the existing state of\r\npolitical affairs in the city, since never before in the history of\r\nthe party had the general committee divided into two factions of\r\nnearly equal numbers, one ordering primaries for the election of a new\r\ncommittee, and the other calling upon the State committee to direct an\r\nentire reorganisation. However, he continued, abundant precedent\r\nexisted for the arbitrary reorganisation of assembly, district, and\r\nward committees by county committees. Since the State committee bore\r\nthe same official relation to county committees that those committees\r\nsustained to local organisations within their jurisdiction, it had\r\nsufficient authority to act in the present crisis.[1296]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1295: \"Mr. Conkling had already had much to do with the\r\nappointment of this committee, but it is worthy of note that several\r\nchanges in the federal offices were made almost simultaneously with\r\nthe vote of the committee for Mr. Murphy's reorganisation, and that\r\nthe men who voted for it got the best places. Addison H. Laflin was\r\nmade naval officer, Lockwood L. Doty was made pension agent, Richard\r\nCrowley was made United States attorney for the Northern District. It\r\nwill be seen that the committee were not disinterested in trying to\r\nplease Conkling and Murphy.\"--New York _Evening Post_, September 29,\r\n1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1296: New York _Times_, March 11, 1871.]\r\n\r\nConscious of the motive inspiring Cornell's action, Greeley replied\r\nthat the State committee was the creature of State conventions,\r\ndelegated with certain powers confined to the interval of time between\r\nsuch conventions. It executed its annual functions and expired. When\r\ncontesting delegations from rival general committees had presented\r\nthemselves in 1868, the State convention, rather than intrust the\r\nreorganisation to the State committee, appointed a special committee\r\nfor the purpose, and when, in 1869, that committee made its report,\r\nthe State convention resolved that the general committee of 1870\r\nshould thereafter be the regular and the only organisation. Nor was\r\nthat all. When a resolution was introduced in the State convention of\r\n1870 to give the State committee power to interfere with the general\r\ncommittee, the convention frowned and peremptorily dismissed it.\r\nNeither did the State committee, Greeley continued, take anything by\r\nanalogy. County committees had never assumed to dissolve or reorganise\r\nassembly or district committees, nor had the power ever been conceded\r\nthem, since assembly and district committees were paramount to county\r\ncommittees. But aside from this the general committee had other and\r\ngreater powers than those of county committees, for the State\r\nconvention in 1863, in 1866, and again in 1869 ordered that Republican\r\nelectors in each city and assembly district should be enrolled into\r\nassociations, delegates from each of which composed the general\r\ncommittee. No such power was conceded to county committees.[1297]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1297: New York _Tribune_, March 3 and May 2, 1871.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this statement seemed to negative its jurisdiction to\r\ninterfere, the State committee, exposing the real reason for its\r\naction, based its right to proceed on the existence of improper\r\npractices, claiming that certain officers and members of the Greeley\r\nand district committees held positions in city departments under the\r\ncontrol of Tammany, and that when members of Republican associations\r\nwere discharged from federal offices by reason of Democratic\r\naffiliations, they were promptly appointed to places under Democratic\r\nofficials.[1298] To this the Greeley committee replied that Republicans\r\nholding municipal offices did so under a custom growing out of mixed\r\ncommissions of Republicans and Democrats, which divided certain places\r\nbetween the two parties--a custom as old as the party itself, and one\r\nthat had received the sanction of its best men. Indeed, it continued,\r\nGeorge Opdyke, a member of the State committee, had himself, when\r\nmayor, appointed well-known Democrats on condition that Republicans\r\nshould share the minor offices,[1299] and a Republican governor and\r\nSenate, in placing a Tammany official at the head of the\r\nstreet-cleaning department, invoked the same principle of\r\ndivision.[1300] Several members of the State committee had themselves,\r\nuntil recently, held profitable places by reason of such an\r\nunderstanding without thought of their party fealty being questioned.\r\nIt was a recognition of the rights of the minority. As to the wisdom\r\nof such a policy the committee did not express an opinion, but it\r\nsuggested that if members of the general committee or of district\r\nassociations, holding such city places, should be charged with party\r\ninfidelity, prompt expulsion would follow proof of guilt. It declared\r\nitself as anxious to maintain party purity and fidelity as the State\r\ncommittee, and for the purpose of investigating all charges it\r\nappointed a sub-committee.[1301]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1298: New York _Times_, January 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1299: New York _Tribune_, September 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1300: New York _Times_, February 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1301: New York _Times_, Feb. 3, 1871.]\r\n\r\nIt was manifest from the first, however, that no investigation, no\r\npurging of the rolls, no compromise would avail. The charge had gone\r\nforth that \"Tammany Republicans\" controlled the Greeley committee, and\r\nin reply to the demand for specifications the State committee accused\r\nHenry Smith and others with using Tammany's police, taking orders from\r\nSweeny, and participating in Ring enterprises to the detriment of the\r\nRepublican party.[1302] \"These men,\" said the _Times_, \"are receiving\r\nthe devil's pay, and consequently, it is to be presumed, are doing the\r\ndevil's work. Republicans under Tammany cannot serve two masters. A\r\nRepublican has a right to serve Tweed if he chooses. But he ought not\r\nat the same time to be taken into the confidence of Republicans who\r\nwage war against Tammany for debasing the bench, the bar, and every\r\nchannel of political life.\"[1303]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1302: _Ibid._, Jan. 7, 12, 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1303: _Ibid._, Jan. 25.]\r\n\r\nTo articles of this character Greeley replied that the Republicanism\r\nof Cornell and Smith did not differ. They had graced the same ticket;\r\nthey had gone harmonious members of the same delegation to the last\r\nState convention; and they were fellow members of the State committee,\r\ncreated by that convention, Smith being aided thither by Cornell's\r\nvote.[1304] In the presence of such evidence the Fenton faction\r\ndeclared that there was neither soundness nor sincerity in the\r\n_Times'_ statements or in the State committee's charges. Nevertheless,\r\nit was known then and publicly charged afterward that, although\r\nthoroughly honest himself, Greeley had long been associated with the\r\nmost selfish politicians in the State outside of Murphy and the\r\nTammany Ring.[1305] Thus the accusation against \"Tammany Republicans\"\r\nbecame a taking cry, since the feeling generally obtained that it was\r\nquite impossible for a man to perform service for Tweed and be a\r\nfaithful Republican. Formerly the question had assumed less\r\nimportance, but Tammany, identified with fraudulent government, a\r\ncorrupt judiciary, and a dishonest application of money, could no\r\nlonger be treated as a political organisation. Its leaders were\r\nthieves, it was argued, and a Republican entering their service must\r\nalso be corrupt. In his letter to John A. Griswold, Conkling openly\r\ncharged the Greeley committee with being corrupted and controlled by\r\nTammany money.[1306]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1304: New York _Tribune_, September 15, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1305: The _Nation_, May 9, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1306: New York _Tribune_, September 4, 1871.]\r\n\r\nThe controversy, bitter enough before, became still more bitter now.\r\nConscious that all was lost if the State committee succeeded, the\r\nGreeley organisation, by a vote of 99 to 1, declined to be\r\nreorganised. \"The determination of the State committee to dissolve the\r\nregular Republican organisation of the city of New York and to create\r\nanother, without cause and without power,\" it said, \"is an act\r\nunprecedented in its nature, without justification, incompatible with\r\nthe principles and life of the Republican party, and altogether an act\r\nof usurpation, unmitigated by either policy or necessity.\"[1307]\r\nGreeley alone appeared willing to yield. He offered a resolution,\r\nwhich, while describing the State committee's order as an injustice\r\nand a wrong, agreed to obey it; but an adverse majority of 91 to 9\r\nshowed that his associates interpreted his real feelings.[1308]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1307: New York _Times_, April 7, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1308: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThus the break had come. It was not an unusual event for the general\r\ncity committee to quarrel. For many years Republican contentions in\r\nthe metropolis had occupied the attention of the party throughout the\r\nState. In fact a State convention had scarcely met without being\r\nwearied with them. But everything now conspired to make the spirit of\r\nfaction unrelenting and to draw the line sharply between friend and\r\nfoe. The removal of Grinnell, the declaration of Greeley against\r\nGrant's renomination,[1309] the intense bitterness between Conkling and\r\nFenton, and the boast of the State committee that it would control\r\nthe State convention and substitute its own creature for the Greeley\r\ncommittee, all coalesced against harmony and a compromise.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1309: New York _Tribune_, May 6, September 15, 1871.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, even the appearance of relations between Greeley and\r\nConkling had ceased. \"Mr. Conkling's frenzy,\" said the _Tribune_,\r\n\"generally comes on during executive session, when, if we may be\r\nallowed the metaphor, he gets upon stilts and supports his dignity....\r\nWe can see the pose of that majestic figure, the sweep of that\r\nbolt-hurling arm, the cold and awful gleam of that senatorial eye, as\r\nhe towers above the listening legislators.\" It spoke of him as the\r\n\"Pet of the Petticoats,\" the \"Apollo of the Senate,\" the \"darling of\r\nthe ladies' gallery,\" who \"could look hyacinthine in just thirty\r\nseconds after the appearance of a woman.\" Then it took a shot at the\r\nSenator's self-appreciation. \"No one can approach him, if anybody can\r\napproach him, without being conscious that there is something great\r\nabout Conkling. Conkling himself is conscious of it. He walks in a\r\nnimbus of it. If Moses' name had been Conkling when he descended from\r\nthe Mount, and the Jews had asked him what he saw there, he would\r\npromptly have replied, 'Conkling!' It is a little difficult to see why\r\nMr. Conkling did not gain a reputation during the war. Many men took\r\nadvantage of it for the display of heroic qualities. But this was not\r\nConkling's opportunity. Is he a man to make a reputation while his\r\ncountry is in danger? He was not. Probably he knew best when to hitch\r\nhis dogcart to a star. Such a man could afford to wait. Wrapped in the\r\nmantle of his own great opinion of himself, he could afford to let his\r\ngreat genius prey upon itself until the fulness of time.\"[1310] Of\r\ncourse, after this there could be no relations between the editor and\r\nthe senator. These editorials recalled the Blaine episode, and\r\nalthough not so steeped in bitterness, as a character-study they did\r\nnot differ from the prototype.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1310: New York _Tribune_ (editorials), May 19, 20, 25, 1871.]\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of affairs when the Republican convention met\r\nat Syracuse on September 27. Except Greeley every prominent leader in\r\nthe State attended. The question whether the rival general committee\r\ncreated by the State organisation should be recognised involved the\r\nwhole party, and the audience assembled surpassed any previous\r\nattendance. The presence of a multitude of federal officials as\r\ndelegates and leaders indicated that the Administration at Washington\r\nalso took a deep interest. There was much doubt and solicitude as to\r\nthe result, for no opportunity had been given the factions to measure\r\nstrength since the convention of 1870. The nomination of a minority\r\ncandidate for speaker of the Assembly in the preceding January had\r\nbeen claimed as a Fenton victory, but the selection of James W.\r\nHusted, then at the threshold of a long and conspicuous career, did\r\nnot turn on such a hinge. Husted had strength of his own. Although\r\nnever to become an orator of great power and genuine inspiration, his\r\nquickness of perception, coupled with the manners of an accomplished\r\ngentleman, brilliant in conversation and formidable in debate, made\r\nhim a popular favourite whose strength extended beyond faction. Now,\r\nhowever, the issue was sharply drawn, and when Alonzo B. Cornell\r\ncalled the convention to order, the opposing forces, marshalled for a\r\nfight to the finish, announced Andrew D. White and Chauncey M. Depew\r\nas their respective candidates for temporary chairman. White's recent\r\nappointment as a commissioner to San Domingo had been a distinct gain\r\nto the President's scheme of annexation, and he now appeared at the\r\nconvention in obedience to Cornell's solicitation.[1311] To gain a bit\r\nof advantage Depew, in the interest of harmony, he said, withdrew in\r\nfavour of G. Hilton Scribner of Westchester, who had headed a young\r\nmen's association formed to allay strife between the rival senators.\r\nThe suggestion being accepted, Depew then moved to make Scribner and\r\nWhite temporary and permanent chairmen. Upon the temporary chairman\r\ndepended the character of the committees, and Cornell, with a frown\r\nupon his large, sallow, cleanly shaven face, promptly ruled the motion\r\nout of order. When a Fenton delegate appealed from the Chair's\r\nruling, he refused to put the question.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1311: White, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 164.]\r\n\r\nInstantly the convention was upon its feet. Demands for roll-call and\r\nthe shouts of a hundred men stifled the work of the gavel. Police\r\ninterference increased the noise. In the midst of the confusion the\r\nstentorian voice of John Cochrane, a Fenton delegate, declared \"the\r\nroll entirely wrong.\"[1312] This aggravated the situation. Finally,\r\nwhen delegates and chairman had physically exhausted themselves, Waldo\r\nM. Hutchins was allowed to suggest that in all cases of contested\r\nseats the names of delegates be passed. To this Cornell reluctantly\r\nagreed amidst loud applause from the Fenton faction, which desired its\r\naction interpreted as an unselfish concession in the interest of\r\nharmony; but the tremendous surprise subsequently displayed upon the\r\nannouncement of White's election by 188 to 159 revealed its\r\ninsincerity. It had confidently counted on twenty-one additional\r\nvotes, or a majority of thirteen.[1313] Thus, in a moment, were\r\nbrightest hopes and fairest prospects blasted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1312: New York _Tribune_, September 28, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1313: \"In particular they [the Fenton men] felt sure of one\r\nvote not received from Allegany County, two from Broome, three from\r\nColumbia, two from Cortlandt, three from Dutchess, three from\r\nJefferson, one from Ontario, three from Washington, and three from\r\nWayne.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Murphy's office-holders were numerous and active, and turned the\r\nwhole organisation into an instrument for the service of his\r\n[Conkling's] personal ambition. When the State convention was to meet,\r\nMr. Conkling and Mr. Murphy were among the first at Syracuse. It was\r\nremarked that while they worked hard, they took no thought of the\r\nreform movement. Their sole object was to control the convention. The\r\nconfidence which the delegates placed in them was astonishing, but\r\nmore astonishing still was the manner in which Andrew D. White lent\r\nhimself to this faction and did its work.\"--New York _Evening Post_,\r\nSeptember 29, 1871.]\r\n\r\nIt was easy to speculate as to the cause of this overthrow. To declare\r\nit the triumph of patronage; to assert that delegates from Republican\r\nstrongholds supported Fenton and that others from counties with\r\noverwhelming Democratic majorities sustained Conkling; to stigmatise\r\nthe conduct of Cornell as an unprecedented exhibition of tyranny, and\r\nto charge White with seeking the votes of Fenton members on the plea\r\nthat his action would promote harmony,[1314] probably did not economise\r\nthe truth. Explanations, however, could not relieve the anguish of\r\ndefeat or nerve the weak to greater effort. Many delegates, filled\r\nwith apprehension and anxious to be on the winning side, thought\r\nannihilation more likely than any sincere and friendly understanding,\r\na suspicion that White's committee appointments quickly ratified.\r\nAlthough the Fenton faction comprised nearly one-half the convention,\r\nthe Committee on Credentials stood 12 to 2 in favour of Conkling. Of\r\ncourse the famous president of Cornell University did not select this\r\ncommittee. He simply followed custom and fathered the list of names\r\nCornell handed him.[1315] \"But in blindly consenting to be thus used by\r\nthe State committee,\" wrote Greeley, \"he became the instrument of such\r\nan outrage as no respectable presiding officer of any prominent\r\ndeliberative body has ever committed.\"[1316]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1314: \"Mr. White personally sought the votes of Fenton\r\nmembers for the temporary chairmanship on the pledge that he would so\r\nact as to promote harmony.\"--New York _Tribune_, October 21, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1315: \"I received the list of the convention committees from\r\nthe State committee with express assurance that the list represented\r\nfairly the two wings of the party. I had no reason then, and have no\r\nreason now, to believe that the State committee abused my\r\nconfidence.\"--White, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1316: New York _Tribune_, September 29, 1871.]\r\n\r\nTo the Fenton faction this severe criticism of a presumably fair man\r\nseemed justified after his jug-handle committee had made its\r\njug-handle report. It favoured seating all contesting delegates\r\noutside of the City, admitted the Greeley delegates and their\r\nopponents with the right to cast half of one vote, and recognised the\r\norganisation established by the State committee as the regular and the\r\nonly one. By this time the dullest delegate understood the trend of\r\naffairs. Indeed, dismissals and appointments in the civil service had\r\npreceded the assembling of the convention until politicians understood\r\nthat the way to preferment opened only to those obedient to the new\r\ndictator. Accordingly, on the next roll-call, the weak-kneed took\r\nflight, the vote standing 202 to 116. Upon hearing the astounding\r\nresult a Fenton delegate exclaimed, \"Blessed are they that expect\r\nnothing, for they shall not be disappointed.\"[1317]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1317: New York _Tribune_, September 28, 1871.]\r\n\r\nIn discussing the resolution to abolish the Greeley committee the\r\nquestion narrowed itself to members holding office under Tammany, the\r\nGreeley organisation maintaining that it had simply inherited the\r\ncustom, not created it, while Cornell and his associates, having\r\n\"Hank\" Smith in mind, declared it impossible to avoid the custom\r\nwithout destroying the committee. To some of the Conkling leaders this\r\nseemed unnecessarily severe. Having showed their teeth they hesitated\r\nto lacerate the party, especially after the mad rush to the winning\r\nside had given them an overwhelming majority. At last, it fell to\r\nHamilton Ward, a friend of the Senator, for six years a member of\r\nCongress, a forcible speaker, and still a young man of nerve, who was\r\nto become attorney-general and a judge of the Supreme Court, to\r\npropose as a substitute that the State committee be directed to\r\nconsolidate and perfect the two city organisations. The Fenton people\r\npromptly acquiesced, and their opponents, after eliminating Smith by\r\ndisallowing a member of the organisation to hold office under Tammany,\r\ncheerfully accepted it.\r\n\r\nThis compromise, thus harmoniously perfected in the presence and\r\nhearing of the convention, was loudly applauded, and the chairman had\r\nrisen to put the motion when Conkling interrupted, \"Not yet the\r\nquestion, Mr. President!\" Until then the Senator had been a silent\r\nspectator. Indeed, not until the previous roll-call did he become a\r\nmember of the convention. But he was now to become its master. His\r\nslow, measured utterances and deep chest-tones commanded instant\r\nattention. If for a moment, as he calmly declared opposition to the\r\nsubstitute, he seemed to stand alone, his declaration that a horde of\r\nTammany ballot-box stuffers, pirates, and robbers had controlled and\r\ndebauched the Republican organisation in the city of New York called\r\nforth the loudest applause of the evening. His next statement, that\r\nthe time had come when such encroachments must cease, renewed the\r\ncheering. Having thus paid his respects to the Greeley committee,\r\nConkling argued that a new State committee could not do in the four\r\nweeks preceding election what it had taken the old committee months to\r\naccomplish. The campaign must be made not with a divided organisation,\r\nbut with ranks closed up. Reading from an editorial in the _Tribune_,\r\nhe claimed that it approved the committee's report, and he begged the\r\nconvention to take the editor at his word, shake hands, bury\r\nanimosities and disappointments, make up a ticket equally of both\r\nfactions, and accept the reorganisation of the city committee, so that\r\ndouble delegations might not appear at the next national convention to\r\nparade their dissensions. He disclaimed any unkind feeling, and in\r\nfavouring the admission of both city delegations, he said, he supposed\r\nhe had worked in the interest of harmony.\r\n\r\nThis appeal has been called one of Conkling's \"most remarkable\r\nspeeches.\"[1318] Unlike the Senator's usual efforts laboured\r\npreparation did not precede it. The striking passage and the\r\nimpressive phrase are entirely wanting. Epigrammatic utterances are\r\nthe supreme test of a great orator or poet, but Conkling's speech of\r\nSeptember 27 added nothing to that vocabulary. It may be said to lack\r\nevery element of a well-ordered oration. As preserved in the\r\nnewspapers of the day[1319] it is hard, if not impossible, to find\r\nsufficient rhetorical merit to entitle it to a place in any volume of\r\nordinary addresses. It wanted the persuasive power that allures by an\r\nexquisite choice of words, or charms by noble and sympathetic\r\nelocution. Even the style of his appeal for harmony was too\r\nself-assured and his faith in his own superiority too evident.\r\nNevertheless, of the living who heard his explosive exclamation, \"Not\r\nyet the question, Mr. President,\" and the flaming sentences arraigning\r\nthe Greeley Republicans as partners of Tammany, it lingers in the\r\nmemory as a forceful philippic, full of pose and gesture and dramatic\r\naction. Its influence, however, is not so clear. The power of\r\npatronage had already twice carried the convention, and that this\r\nincentive would have done so again had Conkling simply whispered to\r\nhis lieutenants, must be evident to all who read the story. Ward's\r\nmotion was lost by 154 to 194, the Conkling vote being eight less than\r\non the preceding roll-call.[1320]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1318: \"Such a speech, in its terms, its forcible eloquence,\r\nits overwhelming results, was perhaps never heard in a similar\r\nassemblage. Many of Senator Conkling's friends insist that this was\r\none of his most remarkable speeches.\"--Alfred R. Conkling, _Life of\r\nRoscoe Conkling_, p. 341.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1319: Syracuse _Standard_, New York _Times_, September 28,\r\n1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1320: \"Just as the whole convention had agreed upon the\r\ncompromise, Conkling arose and ordered his office-holders to reject\r\nit.\"--New York _Evening Post_, September 29.]\r\n\r\nConkling desired a solid delegation at the next Republican National\r\nConvention, and the recognition of the organisation established by the\r\nState committee assured it, whereas the Ward amendment, by including\r\nthe Greeley constituency, inspired the fear of a divided one.[1321]\r\nPerhaps the failure of his friends to appreciate this fear justified\r\nConkling's interference, but a single word of dissent was sufficient\r\nto alarm them, while a less arrogant and dominating spirit might\r\neasily have avoided making the bitter assault which provoked a storm\r\nof hostile criticism. Greeley's stinging retort illuminated the\r\nSenator's insincerity. \"Conkling declared it right,\" said the editor,\r\n\"to abolish the regular organisation because corrupted and controlled\r\nby Tammany money, and then invited its delegates to an equal share in\r\nmaking the platform and selecting a ticket. If he believed what he\r\nsaid, he was guilty of party treason in the offer; if he did not, he\r\nadded the folly of insult to the crime of foul slander.\"[1322] This was\r\nthe view of the Greeley delegates, and refusing to accept the offered\r\nterms, Moses H. Grinnell, Marshall O. Roberts, and their associates,\r\namid ironical cheers, withdrew from the convention.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1321: New York _Tribune_, June 1, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1322: New York _Tribune_, September 29, 1871.]\r\n\r\nAfter this business progressed smoothly and easily. There were no\r\ndivisions, no debates, and no questions of importance. Nominations\r\naroused little enthusiasm,[1323] and the platform which Greeley called\r\n\"the miracle of clumsiness,\"[1324] indorsed the administration of\r\nPresident Grant, denounced the crimes of the Tweed ring, and\r\nrecommended local option. Meanwhile the seceders, assembled in Wild's\r\nOpera House, gave vent to bitter criticism and the whispered scandal\r\nof hotel lobbies.[1325] When this proceeding finally ended they\r\nseparated with the consciousness that their last performance, at\r\nleast, had made them ridiculous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1323: The State ticket was as follows: Secretary of State, G.\r\nHilton Scribner, Westchester; Comptroller, Nelson K.

Taylor, Oneida; Canal Commissioner,\r\nAlexander Barkley, Washington; Prison Inspector, Thomas Kirkpatrick,\r\nCayuga.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1324: New York _Tribune_, September 29, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1325: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTILDEN CRUSHES TAMMANY\r\n\r\n1871\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Conkling was disposing of Greeley and the Fenton organisation,\r\nSamuel J. Tilden prepared to crush Tammany. Tweed had reason to fear\r\nTilden. In 1869 he accused the Ring of being \"opposed to all good\r\ngovernment.\"[1326] Afterward, in 1870, the defeat of the Young\r\nDemocracy's charter added to his bitterness. On the evening of the day\r\non which that vote occurred, Tweed jeered Tilden as the latter passed\r\nthrough the hotel corridor, while Tilden, trembling with suppressed\r\nemotion, expressed the belief that the Boss would close his career in\r\njail or in exile.[1327] One wonders that Tilden, being a natural\r\ndetective, should have delayed strenuous action until the _Times'_\r\nexposure, but when, at last, a knowledge of the colossal frauds\r\nsuddenly opened the way to successful battle, he seized the advantage\r\nwith the skill and persistency of a master.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1326: Paine, _Life of Nast_, p. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1327: This remark was addressed to Henry Richmond, whose\r\nfather, Dean Richmond, died in Tilden's home in Gramercy Park.\r\nRichmond succeeded his father as State committeeman.]\r\n\r\nIn his crusade he did not unite with Republicans, for whom he had no\r\nliking. He was not only an intense partisan, but he had a positive\r\ngenius for saying bitter things in the bitterest way. To him the\r\nquarter of a century covered by Van Buren, Marcy, and Wright, shone as\r\nan era of honour and truth, while the twenty-four years spanned by the\r\nRepublicans and the party from whence they sprung brought shame and\r\ndisgrace upon the State. \"The Republicans made the morals of the\r\nlegislative bodies what they have recently become. When Seward and\r\nWeed took the place of Wright, Marcy, and Flagg, public and official\r\nmorality fell in the twinkling of an eye. Even our city government,\r\nuntil 1870, was exactly what a Republican legislature made it. The\r\nleague between corrupt Republicans and corrupt Democrats, which was\r\nformed during Republican ascendency, proved too strong for honest men.\r\nThe charter of 1870 which I denounced in a public speech, had the\r\nvotes of nearly all the Republicans and Democrats.\"[1328] Still, he\r\nadmitted that Tammany was synonymous with Democracy, and that its\r\ncorruption, especially since its blighting influence had become so\r\nnotorious and oppressive, impeded and dishonoured the party. Under its\r\nrule primaries had been absurdities and elections a farce. Without\r\nbeing thoroughly reorganised, therefore, the party, in his opinion,\r\ncould not exist.[1329]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1328: Tilden's letter to the Democracy, dated September 11,\r\n1871.--New York _Tribune_, September 22, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1329: Tilden's interview.--_Ibid._, Sept 23.]\r\n\r\nIn this spirit Tilden entered upon the great work of his life. Two\r\nclasses of Democrats faced him--the more clamorous reformers and the\r\nenemies of all reform. To the latter reorganisation seemed a reckless\r\nstep. It argued that the loss of the Tammany vote meant the\r\ndissolution of the party, and that a great organisation ought not to\r\nbe destroyed for the wrong of a few individuals, since the party was\r\nnot responsible for them. Besides, the executive power of the State,\r\nwith its vast official patronage scattered throughout all the\r\ncounties, would oppose such a policy. On the other hand, the first\r\nclass, possessing little faith in the party's ability to purge itself,\r\nthreatened to turn reform into political revolution. It desired a new\r\nparty. Nevertheless, Tilden did not hesitate. He issued letters to\r\nthousands of Democrats, declaring that \"wherever the gangrene of\r\ncorruption has reached the Democratic party we must take a knife and\r\ncut it out by the roots;\"[1330] he counselled with Horatio Seymour and\r\nCharles O'Conor; he originated the movement that ultimately sent a\r\nreform delegation to the State convention; he consented to stand for\r\nthe Assembly; and finally, to secure the fruit of three months' work,\r\nhe raised one-half the funds expended by the Democratic reform\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1330: Tilden's letter, _Ibid._, Sept. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe Ring had not been an indifferent observer of these efforts. While\r\nit cared little for the control of a State convention without a\r\ngovernor to nominate, its continued existence absolutely depended upon\r\na majority in the Senate. Tweed planned to carry the five senatorial\r\ndistricts in the city, and to re-elect if possible the eight\r\nRepublican senators whom he had used the year before.[1331] This would\r\ninsure him control. To achieve his purpose word was sent to Tilden\r\nearly in August that he could name the delegates to the State\r\nconvention and the candidates upon the State ticket if he would not\r\ninterfere with Tammany's legislative nominations. If Tilden had not\r\nbefore distrusted Tweed, such a proposition must have aroused his\r\nsuspicion. But Tilden, conscious of the need of an anti-Tweed\r\nlegislature, had surmised the Ring's plan as early as Tweed devised\r\nit, and he replied with firmness that everything beside the\r\nlegislative ticket was of minor importance to him. Similar\r\npropositions, presented by powerful men from all parts of the State\r\nwith the plea that a compromise would \"save the party,\" received the\r\nsame answer.[1332] Meanwhile, he laboured to shorten the life of the\r\nRing. To him Richard Connolly appealed for protection against Tweed's\r\ntreachery, and at Tilden's suggestion the comptroller turned over his\r\noffice to Andrew H. Green, thus assuring the protection of the records\r\nwhich subsequently formed the basis of all civil and criminal actions.\r\nTilden's sagacity in procuring the opinion of Charles O'Conor also\r\nsecured the Mayor's acquiescence in Green's possession of the office,\r\nwhile his patient investigation of the Broadway Bank accounts\r\ndiscovered the judicial proofs that opened the prison doors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1331: Tilden's Speech.--New York _Times_, November 3, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1332: Tweed's Speech.--_Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThese were fatal blows to the Ring. The leading Democratic papers of\r\nthe interior, notably the Buffalo _Courier_ and Albany _Argus_, came\r\nboldly out demanding the dismissal of the shameless robbers who were\r\ndisgracing the name and destroying the future of their party.\r\nMoreover, Tilden, like an avenging angel, with all the skill and\r\nknowledge of his kind, had united into one great reform party the four\r\nDemocratic organisations of the city, pledged to oppose Tammany.[1333]\r\nThis formidable combination, having complied with every requirement of\r\nthe State committee, selected delegates to the State convention. The\r\nhearts of Tweed and his associates may well have sunk within them as\r\nthey studied this list. There were able lawyers like William E.\r\nCurtis; powerful merchants like Havermeyer; influential editors like\r\nOttendorfer; solid business men like Schell; and determined members of\r\nthe Committee of Seventy like Roswell D. Hatch, who had been\r\nconspicuous in tracking the thieves. But the name that must have shone\r\nmost formidably in the eyes of Tweed was that of Charles O'Conor. It\r\nstood at the head of the list like a threatening cloud in the sky,\r\nready to bring ruin upon the Ring. The moral support of his great\r\nlegal fame, affirming the validity of Andrew H. Green's possession of\r\nthe comptroller's office, had intimidated O'Gorman, Tweed's\r\ncorporation counsel, and shattered the plot to forcibly eject Tilden's\r\nfaithful friend under colour of judicial process. Thus the reform\r\nparty seemed to be in the ascendant. With confidence Tilden expressed\r\nthe belief that the State convention would repudiate Tammany.[1334]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1333: The German Democratic General Committee, with 30,000\r\nvotes; the Democratic Union, with 27,000; the Ledwith party, with\r\n10,000; and the Young Democracy, led by ex-Sheriff O'Brien. For five\r\nyears Mozart Hall, under Fernando Wood, had not placed a ticket in the\r\nfield.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1334: Interview, New York _Tribune_, September 23, 1871.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it had become well known that Tilden would not compromise,\r\nTweed lost none of his former prestige. His control of the State\r\nconvention which assembled at Rochester on October 4 (1871) seemed as\r\nfirm as on that day in 1870 when he renominated John T. Hoffman. It\r\nwas still the fashion to praise all he said and all he did. Before his\r\narrival the Reformers claimed a majority, but as the up-State\r\ndelegates crowded his rooms to bend the obsequious knee he reduced\r\nthese claims to a count, finding only forty-two disobedient members.\r\nHe was too tactful, however, to appear in the convention hall. His\r\nduty was to give orders, and like a soldier he pitched his\r\nheadquarters near the scene of action, boasting that his friends were\r\neverywhere ready for battle.\r\n\r\nIn his opening speech Tilden touched the Ring frauds with the delicacy\r\nof a surgeon examining an abscess, and the faint response that greeted\r\nhis condemnation of corruption satisfied him that the convention did\r\nnot appreciate the danger of party blood-poisoning. The truth of this\r\ndiagnosis more fully appeared when Tammany, \"in the interest of\r\nharmony,\" waived its right to participate in the proceedings. The\r\nwhirlwind of applause which greeted this \"unselfish act\" had scarcely\r\nsubsided when a delegate from Kings county, acting for Tweed, moved\r\nthe previous question on a resolution reciting that hereafter, on the\r\ncall of the roll, the city of New York be omitted since it presented\r\nno delegation bearing the prestige of regularity. This threw the\r\nReformers into an animated counsel. They knew of the proposed\r\nwithdrawal of Tammany, which seemed to them to smooth the way for the\r\nacceptance of their credentials, but the resolution came with\r\nstartling suddenness. It narrowed the question of their admission to a\r\nmere technicality and cut off debate. Tilden, appreciating the\r\nambuscade into which he had fallen, exhausted every expedient to\r\nmodify the parliamentary situation, knowing it to be in the power of\r\nthe convention to accept another delegation regardless of its\r\nregularity, as the Republicans had done at Syracuse in the previous\r\nweek. But the delegates derisively laughed at his awkward predicament\r\nas they adopted the resolution by a vote of 90 to 4.\r\n\r\nBy this act the convention clearly indicated its purpose to treat the\r\nfraud issue as a local matter and to keep it out of the State\r\ncampaign. It intended to denounce the crime and the criminals, and to\r\nallow no one to become a delegate who had aided or in anywise profited\r\nby the conspiracy, but it would not recognise a delegation which\r\ndesired to reorganise the party in the metropolis by humiliating a\r\ngreat association whose regularity had been accepted for many years,\r\nand which had finally turned the State over to the Democracy. This\r\nview had the support of every office-holder and of every appointee of\r\nthe Executive, whose great desire to \"save the party\" had its\r\ninspiration in a greater desire to save themselves. On the other hand,\r\nthe minority argued that allowing Tammany voluntarily to withdraw from\r\nthe convention was equivalent to its endorsement, thus giving its\r\nnominations regularity. This would compel the Democratic masses, in\r\norder to participate in the primaries, to vote its ticket. Tilden\r\nsought to avoid this regularity just as Conkling had destroyed the\r\nGreeley committee, and if office-holders had supported him as they did\r\nthe Senator he must have won as easily.\r\n\r\nThe convention's treatment of Horatio Seymour also exhibited its\r\ndislike of the reformer. Seymour came to the convention to be its\r\npresident, and upon his entrance to the hall had been hailed, amidst\r\ntumultuous cheers, as \"Our future president in 1872.\" While waiting\r\nthe conclusion of the preliminary proceedings he observed Francis\r\nKernan sitting outside the rail with the rejected Reformers.\r\nHesitatingly, and in the hope, he said, of arousing no unpleasant\r\ndiscussion, he moved the admission of the veteran Democrat, whom he\r\ndescribed as grown gray in the party harness, and whose very presence\r\nwas a sufficient credential to his title to a seat. Kernan, being in\r\nsympathy with Tilden, was _non persona grata_ to Tammany, and Seymour\r\nhad scarcely resumed his seat when the ubiquitous delegate from Kings,\r\nwith a flourish of rhetoric, promptly substituted another, who, he\r\nalleged, was the regularly elected delegate as well as \"the friend of\r\nthat great Democrat, John T. Hoffman.\" The convention, frantic with\r\ndelight at the mention of the Governor's name, saw the Oneidan grow\r\nlividly pale with chagrin at this exhibition of Tammany's manners.\r\nSeymour had lived long in years, in fame, and in the esteem of his\r\nparty. He could hardly have had any personal enemies. He possessed no\r\ncapricious dislikes, and his kindly heart, in spite of a stateliness\r\nof bearing, won all the people who came near him. To be thus opposed\r\nand bantered in a Democratic assembly was a deep humiliation, and\r\nafter expressing the hope that the Tammany man would fight for the\r\nDemocratic party as gallantly in future as he had fought against it in\r\nthe past, the illustrious statesman withdrew his motion. When, later,\r\nhis name was announced as presiding officer of the permanent\r\norganisation, the convention discovered to its dismay that Seymour,\r\nfeigning sickness, had returned to Utica.[1335]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1335: \"Governor Seymour was given to understand that he could\r\nnot be president of the convention unless he would forego his\r\nphilippic against the Tammany thieves. This he declined to do.\"--New\r\nYork _Times_ (editorial), October 9, 1871.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day's work it was plain that Tweed had controlled\r\nthe convention. The Reformers had been excluded, the committee on\r\ncontested seats had refused them a hearing, Seymour was driven home,\r\nand a eulogy of Tammany's political services had been applauded to the\r\necho. The platform did, indeed, express indignation at the \"corruption\r\nand extravagance recently brought to light in the municipal affairs of\r\nthe city of New York,\" and condemned \"as unworthy of countenance or\r\ntoleration all who are responsible,\" but the contrast between the acts\r\nof the convention and the words of its platform made its professions\r\nof indignation seem incongruous if not absolutely empty. When one\r\nspeaker, with rhetorical effect, pronounced the frauds in New York\r\n\"the mere dreams of Republican imagination\" delegates sprang to their\r\nfeet amidst ringing cheers. In the joy of victory, Tweed, with\r\ngood-natured contempt, characterised Seymour, Tilden, and Kernan as\r\n\"three troublesome old fools.\"[1336]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1336: New York _Tribune_, October 6, 1871.]\r\n\r\nAfter adjournment the Reformers made no concealment of their bitter\r\ndissatisfaction. Oswald Ottendorfer, editor of the most powerful\r\nGerman Democratic organ then in the State, threatened to issue an\r\naddress denouncing their betrayal, and William E. Curtis, referring to\r\nthe refusal of the credentials' committee, declared that a voice from\r\nthe Democratic masses of New York, seeking relief from a gang of\r\nthieves, was stronger, higher, and more sublime than mere questions of\r\ntechnicality. Under the spur of this threatened revolt, the\r\nconvention, when it reconvened the next day, listened to the\r\nReformers. Their recital was not a panegyric. Ottendorfer said that\r\nthe operation of the previous question exposed the party to the\r\nsuspicion that Tammany's seats would be open for their return after\r\nthe storm of indignation had subsided. O'Conor, in a letter, declared\r\nthat absolute freedom from all complicity in the great official crime\r\nand an utter intolerance of all persons suspected of sympathy with it\r\nmust be maintained, otherwise its action would inflict a fatal wound\r\nupon the party. Curtis characterised the question as one of life or\r\ndeath to a great community weighed down by oppression and crime, and\r\nmaintained that the convention, if it sought to avoid its duty by the\r\nsubterfuge already enacted, would show both sympathy and complicity\r\nwith the oligarchy of terror and infamy. These statements did not\r\nplease the Ring men, who, with much noise, passed contemptuously out\r\nof the hall.\r\n\r\nRiotous interruption, however, did not begin until Tilden announced\r\nthat the real point of the controversy was to estop Tammany, after\r\nnominating five senators and twenty-one assemblymen, from declaring\r\nthe Democratic masses out of the party because they refused to vote\r\nfor its candidates. The whip of party regularity was Tweed's last\r\nreliance, and when Tilden proclaimed absolution to those who\r\ndisregarded it, the friends of Tammany drowned his words with loud\r\ncalls to order. The excitement threatened to become a riot, but\r\nTilden, caring as little for disapprobation as the son of Tisander in\r\nthe story told by Herodotus, calmly awaited silence. \"I was stating,\"\r\nhe continued, without the slightest tremor of a singularly unmusical\r\nvoice, \"what I considered the objection to Tammany Hall, aside from\r\nthe cloud that now covers that concern, and I am free to avow before\r\nthis convention that I shall not vote for any one of Mr. Tweed's\r\nmembers of the Legislature. And if that is to be regarded the regular\r\nticket, I will resign my place as chairman of the State committee and\r\nhelp my people stem the tide of corruption. When I come to do my duty\r\nas an elector, I shall cast my vote for honest men.\"[1337] Then, to\r\nshow his independence if not his contempt of the Tweed-bound body,\r\nTilden suddenly waived aside the question of the Reformers' admission\r\nand moved to proceed to the nomination of a State ticket.[1338]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1337: New York _Tribune_, October 6, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1338: Except the candidate for Secretary of State, the old\r\nTweed ticket was renominated as follows: Secretary of State, Diedrich\r\nWillers, Seneca; Comptroller, Asher P. Nichols, Erie; Treasurer,\r\nWheeler H. Bristol, Tioga; Attorney-General, Marshall B. Champlain,\r\nAllegany; Engineer, Van R. Richmond, Wayne; Canal Commissioner, George\r\nW. Chapman; Prison Inspector, David B. McNeil, Cayuga.]\r\n\r\nThe convention was stunned. It became dizzy when he denied Tammany's\r\nright to be regarded as the regular organisation, but his\r\nproclamation, defiantly and clearly made, that hereafter he should\r\nbolt its nominations even if the convention refused to impeach its\r\nregularity, struck a trenchant blow that silenced rather than excited.\r\nSuch courage, displayed at such a critical moment, was sublime. An\r\norganised revolt against an association which had for years been\r\naccepted as regular by State conventions meant the sacrifice of a\r\nmajority and an invitation to certain defeat, yet he hurled the words\r\nof defiance into the face of the convention with the energy of the Old\r\nGuard when called upon to surrender at Waterloo. The course taken by\r\nTilden on this memorable occasion made his own career, and also a new\r\ncareer for his party. From that hour he became the real leader of the\r\nDemocracy. Although more than a twelvemonth must pass before his voice\r\ngave the word of command, his genius as a born master was recognised.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Reformers strengthened the Republicans, whose\r\ndistractions must otherwise have compassed their defeat. Murphyism and\r\nTweedism resembled each other so much that a contest against either\r\npresented a well-defined issue of political morality. The greater\r\nimportance of the Tammany frauds, however, obscured all other issues.\r\nTo preserve their organisation in the up-State counties the Democrats\r\nmade creditable local nominations and professed support of the State\r\nticket, but in the city the entire voting population, irrespective of\r\nformer party alignments, divided into Tammany and anti-Tammany\r\nfactions. As the crusade progressed the details of the great crime,\r\nbecoming better understood, made Tammany's position intolerable. Every\r\nrespectable journal opposed it and every organisation crucified it. In\r\na double-page cartoon, startling in its conception and splendidly\r\npicturesque, Nast represented the Tammany tiger, with glaring eyes and\r\ndistended jaws, tearing the vitals from the crushed and robbed city,\r\nwhile Tweed and his associates sat enthroned.[1339] \"Let's stop those\r\ndamned pictures,\" proposed Tweed when he saw it. \"I don't care so much\r\nwhat the papers write about me--my constituents can't read; but they\r\ncan see pictures.\"[1340]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1339: _Harper's Weekly_, November 4, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1340: Paine, _Life of Nast_, p. 179.]\r\n\r\nOn October 26 all doubt as to the result of the election was\r\ndissipated. Until then belief in Tweed's direct profit in the Ring's\r\novercharges was based upon presumption. No intelligent man having an\r\naccurate knowledge of the facts could doubt his guilt, since every\r\ncircumstance plainly pointed to it, but judicial proof did not exist\r\nuntil furnished by the investigation of the Broadway Bank, which\r\nTilden personally conducted. His analysis of this information\r\ndisclosed the fact that two-thirds of the money paid under the\r\nsanction of the Board of Audit had passed into the possession of\r\npublic officials and their accomplices, some of it being actually\r\ntraced into Tweed's pocket, and upon this evidence, verified by\r\nTilden's affidavit, the Attorney-General based an action on which a\r\nwarrant issued for Tweed's arrest. This announcement flashed over the\r\nState eleven days before the election. It was a powerful campaign\r\ndocument. People had not realised what an avenging hand pursued\r\nTammany, but they now understood that Tweed was a common thief, and\r\nthat Tilden, by reducing strong suspicion to a mathematical certainty,\r\nhad closed the mouths of eulogists and apologists.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election carried dismay and confusion to Tammany.\r\nIts register, its judges, its aldermen, a majority of its assistant\r\naldermen, fourteen of its twenty-one assemblymen, and four of its five\r\nsenators were defeated, while Tweed's majority fell from 22,000 in\r\n1869 to 10,000. As expected the Republicans reaped the benefit of the\r\nanti-Tammany vote, carrying the State by 18,000 majority and the\r\nLegislature by 79 on joint ballot.[1341] To obliterate Tweedism, Tilden\r\nhad overthrown his party, but he had not fallen, Samson-like, under the\r\nruin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1341: Scribner, 387,107; Willers, 368,204. Legislature:\r\nSenate, 24 Republicans, 8 Democrats. Assembly, 97 Republicans, 31\r\nDemocrats.--New York _Tribune_, November 27, 1871.\r\n\r\nCompared with the returns for 1870, the Democratic vote, outside of\r\nNew York and the six counties in its immediate vicinity, fell off\r\n24,167, while the Republican vote fell off 9,235. In New York and\r\nadjoining counties the Republican vote increased 30,338.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\nIn New York City the majority for the Democratic candidate for\r\nsecretary of state was 29,189, while the majority for the Republican\r\nor Union Reform candidate for register was 28,117.--_Ibid._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nGREELEY NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n1872\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Tammany exposure had absorbed public attention, the\r\nRepublican party did not escape serious criticism. Reconstruction had\r\ndisappointed many of its friends. By controlling the negro vote\r\nRepublican administrations in several Southern States had wrought\r\nincalculable harm to the cause of free-government and equal suffrage.\r\nThe State debt of Alabama had increased from six millions in 1860 to\r\nforty millions, that of Florida from two hundred thousand to fifteen\r\nmillions, and that of Georgia from three millions to forty-four\r\nmillions. \"I say to-day, in the face of heaven and before all\r\nmankind,\" declared Tilden, \"that the carpet-bag governments are\r\ninfinitely worse than Tweed's government of the city of New\r\nYork.\"[1342]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1342: New York _Tribune_, September 5, 1872.]\r\n\r\nFollowing such gross misgovernment the reactionary outbreaks\r\ninfluenced Congress to pass the so-called Ku-Klux Act of April 20,\r\n1871, designed to suppress these outrages. This measure, although not\r\ndissimilar to others which protected the negro in his right of\r\nsuffrage, met with stout Republican opposition, the spirited debate\r\nsuddenly heralding a serious party division. Trumbull held it\r\nunconstitutional, while Schurz, reviewing the wretched State\r\ngovernments of the South, the venal officials who misled the negro,\r\nand the riotous corruption of men in possession of great authority,\r\nattacked the policy of the law as unwise and unsound.\r\n\r\nNot less disturbing was the failure of Congress to grant universal\r\namnesty. To this more than to all other causes did the critics of the\r\nRepublican party ascribe the continuance of the animosities of the\r\nwar, since it deprived the South of the assistance of its former\r\nleading men, and turned it over to inexperienced, and, in some\r\ninstances, to corrupt men who used political disabilities as so much\r\ncapital upon which to trade. The shocking brazenness of these methods\r\nhad been disclosed in Georgia under the administration of Governor\r\nBullock, who secured from Congress amnesty for his legislative friends\r\nwhile others were excluded. Schurz declared \"When universal suffrage\r\nwas granted to secure the equal rights of all, universal amnesty ought\r\nto have been granted to make all the resources of political\r\nintelligence and experience available for the promotion of the welfare\r\nof all.\"[1343]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1343: _Congressional Globe_, January 30, 1872, p. 699.]\r\n\r\nThe South had expected the President to develop a liberal policy. The\r\nspirit displayed at Appomattox, his \"Let us have peace\" letter of\r\nacceptance, and his intervention in Virginia and Mississippi soon\r\nafter his inauguration, encouraged the belief that he would conciliate\r\nrather than harass it. His approval of the Ku-Klux law, therefore,\r\nintensified a feeling already strained to bitterness, and although he\r\nadministered the law with prudence, a physical contest occurred in the\r\nSouth and a political rupture in the North. The hostility of the\r\nAmerican people to the use of troops at elections had once before\r\nproved a source of angry contention, and the criticism which now\r\nrained upon the Republican party afforded new evidence of the public's\r\nanimosity.\r\n\r\nThese strictures would have awakened no unusual solicitude in the\r\nminds of Republicans had their inspiration been confined to political\r\nopponents, but suddenly there came to the aid of the Democrats a\r\nformidable array of Republicans. Although the entering wedge was a\r\ndifference of policy growing out of conditions in the Southern States,\r\nother reasons contributed to the rupture. The removal of Motley as\r\nminister to England, coming so soon after Sumner's successful\r\nresistance to the San Domingo scheme, was treated as an attempt to\r\npunish a senator for the just exercise of his right and the honest\r\nperformance of his duty. Nine months later Sumner was discontinued as\r\nchairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. If doubt existed as to\r\nthe ground of Motley's removal, not a shadow clouded the reason for\r\nSumner's deposition. The cause assigned was that he no longer\r\nmaintained personal and social relations with the President and\r\nSecretary of State, but when Schurz stigmatised it as \"a flimsy\r\npretext\" he voiced the opinion of a part of the press which accepted\r\nit as a display of pure vindictiveness. \"The indignation over your\r\nremoval,\" telegraphed John W. Forney, \"extends to men of all parties.\r\nI have not heard one Republican approve it.\"[1344] Among Sumner's\r\ncorrespondents Ira Harris noted the popular disapproval and\r\nindignation in New York. \"Another term of such arrogant assumption of\r\npower and wanton acquiescence,\" said Schurz, \"may furnish the flunkies\r\nwith a store of precedents until people cease to look for ordinary\r\nmeans of relief.\"[1345]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1344: Pierce, _Life of Sumner_, Vol. 4, p. 477.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1345: New York _Tribune_, April 13, 1872.]\r\n\r\nMore disturbing because more irritating in its effects was the\r\nAdministration's disposition to permit the control of its patronage by\r\na coterie of senators, who preferred to strengthen faction regardless\r\nof its influence. Under this policy something had occurred in nearly\r\nevery Northern State to make leading men and newspapers bitter, and as\r\nthe years of the Administration multiplied censure became more\r\ndrastic. Perhaps the influence of Conkling presented a normal phase of\r\nthis practice. The Senator stood for much that had brought criticism\r\nupon the party. He approved the Southern policy and the acquisition of\r\nSan Domingo. He indulged in a personal attack on Sumner, advised his\r\ndeposition from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, commended the\r\nremoval of Motley, and voted against the confirmation of E. Rockwood\r\nHoar for associate justice of the Supreme Court.[1346] He also opposed\r\ncivil service reform.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1346: George F. Hoar, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 306; Vol.\r\n2, p. 77.]\r\n\r\nA statesman so pronounced in his views and in control of abundant\r\npatronage was not likely to change a contest for personal advantage\r\ninto a choice of public policies. Such an one appointed men because of\r\ntheir influence in controlling political caucuses and conventions.\r\n\"The last two State conventions were mockeries,\" declared Greeley,\r\n\"some of the delegates having been bought out of our hands and others\r\ndriven out of the convention.... I saw numbers, under threats of\r\nlosing federal office, dragooned into doing the bidding of one\r\nman.\"[1347] The removal of officials whose names stood high in the roll\r\nof those who had greatly honoured their State deeply wounded many\r\nardent Republicans, but not until the appointment and retention of\r\nThomas Murphy did criticism scorn the veil of hint and innuendo. This\r\nact created a corps of journalistic critics whose unflagging satire\r\nand unswerving severity entertained the President's opponents and\r\namazed his friends. They spoke for the popular side at the moment of a\r\ngreat crisis. Almost daily during the eighteen months of Murphy's\r\nadministration the press of the whole country, under the lead of the\r\n_Tribune_, pictured the collector as a crafty army contractor and the\r\npartner of Tweed. \"I think the warmest friends of Grant,\" wrote\r\nCurtis, \"feel that he has failed terribly as President, not from want\r\nof honesty but from want of tact and great ignorance. It is a\r\npolitical position and he knew nothing of politics.\"[1348] The\r\nsacrifice of the best men among his cabinet advisers added greatly to\r\nthis unrest. In one of his letters, Lowell, unintentionally\r\noverlooking Hamilton Fish, declared that E. Rockwood Hoar and Jacob D.\r\nCox were \"the only really strong men in the Cabinet.\"[1349] After the\r\nlatter's forced resignation and the former's sudden exit to make room\r\nfor a Southern Republican in order to placate carpet-bag senators for\r\nthe removal of Sumner, the great critics of the Administration again\r\ncut loose. \"How long,\" asked Bowles, \"does the President suppose the\r\npeople will patiently endure this dealing with high office as if it\r\nwere a presidential perquisite, to be given away upon his mere whim,\r\nwithout regard to the claims of the office? It was bad enough when he\r\nonly dealt so with consulates and small post-offices; but now that he\r\nhas come to foreign ministers and cabinet officers it is\r\nintolerable.\"[1350]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1347: New York _Tribune_, April 13, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1348: Cary, _Life of Curtis_, p. 213.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1349: _Letters of_, Vol. 2, p. 57.\r\n\r\n\"There was undoubtedly great corruption and maladministration in the\r\ncountry in the time of President Grant. Selfish men and ambitious men\r\ngot the ear of that simple man and confiding President. They studied\r\nGrant, some of them, as the shoemaker measures the foot of his\r\ncustomer.\"--Hoar, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 197.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1350: Springfield (Mass.) _Republican_, November 12, 1870.]\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions Republicans had been losing strength. In the\r\nelection of 1870 their numbers, for the first time since 1864, had\r\nfallen below a two-thirds majority in the national House, while the\r\nDemocrats gained four United States senators. In the same year Carl\r\nSchurz, with the assistance of the Democrats, had carried Missouri on\r\nthe issue of universal amnesty. As the disaffection with the\r\nAdministration became more pronounced, this faction, assuming the name\r\nof Liberal Republicans, met in convention at Jefferson City on January\r\n24, 1872, and invited all Republicans who favoured reform to meet in\r\nnational mass convention at Cincinnati on May 1. This call acted like\r\na lighted match in a pile of shavings, prominent Republicans in every\r\nState, including many leading newspapers, giving it instant and hearty\r\nresponse. Among other journals in New York the _Nation_ and the\r\n_Evening Post_ guardedly approved the movement, and the _World_,\r\nalthough a Democratic organ, offered conditional support. The\r\n_Tribune_ also encouraged the hope that it would eventually swing into\r\nline.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley's principles were in substantial accord with those of\r\nhis party. He had little liking for civil service reform; the\r\nintegrity of the national debt invoked his unflagging support; and the\r\nsuppression of the Ku-Klux, although favouring a liberal Southern\r\npolicy, had received his encouragement.[1351] Nor had he said anything\r\nin speech or writing disrespectful of the President. He did not favour\r\nhis renomination, but he had faith in the essential honesty and\r\nsoundness of Republican voters. Moreover, the demand for \"a genuine\r\nreform of the tariff\" made it impossible to reconcile his policy with\r\nthat of the Liberal Republicans of Missouri.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1351: New York _Tribune_, May 31, 1870; February 27, 1871;\r\nMay 1, 1872.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Greeley's position in the Republican party had become\r\nintolerable. Conkling controlled the city and State machines, Fenton\r\nbelonged in a hopeless minority, and Grant resented the _Tribune's_\r\nopposition to his succession. Besides, the editor's friends had been\r\ndeeply humiliated. The appointment of Murphy was accepted as \"a plain\r\ndeclaration of war.\"[1352] The treatment of the Greeley committee,\r\noverthrown by the power of patronage, also festered in his heart. \"For\r\nmore than a year,\" he said, \"to be an avowed friend of Governor Fenton\r\nwas to be marked for proscription at the White House.\"[1353] Thus, with\r\nthe past unforgiven and the future without hope, the great journalist\r\ndeclared that \"We propose to endure this for one term only.\"[1354]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1352: _Ibid._, April 25, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1353: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1354: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nFrom the first it was apparent that the Republican schism, to be\r\nsuccessful, needed the support of the _Tribune_. Although its\r\ninfluence had materially suffered during and since the war, it still\r\ncontrolled a great constituency throughout the North, and the longer\r\nits chief hesitated to join the new party the more earnest and\r\neloquent did the appeals of the Liberals become. At last, relying upon\r\na compromise of their economic differences, Greeley accepted the\r\ninvitation to meet the Missouri reformers in convention.[1355] His\r\naction was the occasion for much rejoicing, and on April 13 the\r\nLiberals of New York City began their campaign amidst the cheers of an\r\nenthusiastic multitude assembled at Cooper Institute.[1356] The Fenton\r\nleaders, conspicuously posted on the platform, indicated neither a\r\nreal love of reform nor an absence of office-seekers, but the presence\r\namong the vice-presidents of E.L. Godkin of the _Nation_ and Parke\r\nGodwin of the _Post_ removed all doubt as to the sincere desire of\r\nsome of those present to replace Grant with a President who would\r\ndiscourage the use of patronage by enforcing civil service reform, and\r\nencourage good government in the South by enacting universal amnesty.\r\nTo Schurz's charge that the national Republican convention would be\r\nmade up of office-holders, Oliver P. Morton declared, three days later\r\nin the same hall, that there would be more office-seekers at\r\nCincinnati than office-holders at Philadelphia.[1357]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1355: _Ibid._, March 30, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1356: New York _Tribune_, April 14, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1357: Dudley Foulke, _Life of Morton_, Vol. 2, p. 255.]\r\n\r\nThe managers of the Liberal Republican movement preferred Charles\r\nFrancis Adams for President. Adams' public life encouraged the belief\r\nthat he would practise his professed principles, and although isolated\r\nfrom all political associations it was thought his brilliant\r\nchampionship of the North during the temporising of the English\r\ngovernment would make his nomination welcome. David Davis and Lyman\r\nTrumbull of Illinois were likewise acceptable, and Salmon P. Chase had\r\nhis admirers. Greeley's availability was also talked of. His signature\r\nto the bail-bond of Jefferson Davis, releasing the ex-president of the\r\nConfederacy from prison, attracted attention to his presidential\r\nambition, while his loud declaration for universal amnesty opened the\r\nway for a tour of the South. At a brilliant reception in Union Square,\r\ngiven after his return, he described the carpet-bagger as \"a worthless\r\nadventurer whom the Southern States hate and ought to hate,\" likening\r\nhim to the New York legislator \"who goes to Albany nominally to\r\nlegislate, but really to plunder and steal.\"[1358] His excessive zeal\r\nfor Democratic support led to the intimation that he had economised\r\nhis epithets in criticising the Tweed ring.[1359] As early as February,\r\nNast, with his usual foresight, pictured \"H.G., the editor\" offering\r\nthe nomination to \"H.G., the farmer,\" who, rejoicing in the name of\r\nCincinnatus, had turned from the plough toward the dome of the Capitol\r\nin the distance.[1360] To the charge that he was a candidate for\r\nPresident, Greeley frankly admitted that while he was not an aspirant\r\nfor office, he should never decline any duty which his political\r\nfriends saw fit to devolve upon him.[1361]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1358: New York _Tribune_, June 13, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1359: Paine, _Life of Nast_, p. 162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1360: _Ibid._, p. 223.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1361: New York _Tribune_, May 30, 1871.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the men whose earnest efforts had prepared the way for\r\nthe Liberal movement did not encourage Greeley's ambition. Especially\r\nwere his great newspaper associates dumb. A week before the convention\r\nBowles of the Springfield _Republican_ mentioned him with Sumner and\r\nTrumbull as a proper person for the nomination, but Godkin of the\r\n_Nation_, Halstead of the Cincinnati _Commercial_, and Horace White of\r\nthe Chicago _Tribune_ remained silent. The _Evening Post_ spoke of him\r\nas \"the simple-minded philanthropist, with his various scraps of\r\nso-called principles.\"[1362] Jacob D. Cox, Stanley Matthews, and George\r\nHoadley, the conspicuous Liberal triumvirate of Ohio, repudiated his\r\ncandidacy, and Schurz, in his opening speech as president of the\r\nconvention, without mentioning names, plainly designated Adams as the\r\nmost suitable candidate and Greeley as the weakest.[1363]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1362: New York _Post_, May 2, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1363: New York _Times_, May 3.]\r\n\r\nThe first New Yorker to appear at Cincinnati was Reuben E. Fenton,\r\nfollowed by John Cochrane, Waldo M. Hutchins, Sinclair Tousey, and\r\nother seceders from the Syracuse convention of 1871. These political\r\nveterans, with the cunning practised at ward caucuses, quickly\r\norganised the New York delegation in the interest of Greeley. On\r\nmotion of Cochrane, Hutchins became chairman of a committee to name\r\nsixty-eight delegates, the people present being allowed to report two\r\ndelegates from their respective congressional districts. These tactics\r\nbecame more offensive when the committee, instead of accepting the\r\ndelegates reported, arbitrarily assumed the right to substitute\r\nseveral well-known friends of Greeley. Not content with this\r\nadvantage, the majority, on motion of Cochrane, adopted the unit rule,\r\nthus silencing one-third of the delegation.[1364] Henry R. Selden,\r\nwhose reputation for fair dealing had preceded him, characterised this\r\nperformance as \"a most infamous outrage,\" and upon hearing a protest\r\nof the minority, presented by Theodore Bacon of Rochester, Schurz\r\ndenounced the proceeding \"as extraordinary\" and \"as indicating that\r\nthe reform movement, so far as it concerned New York, was virtually in\r\nthe hands of a set of political tricksters, who came here not for\r\nreform, but for plunder.\"[1365]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1364: New York _Evening Post_, May 2, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1365: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nNext to the \"tricksters\" the platform-makers embarrassed the\r\nconvention. It was easy to recognise the equality of all men before\r\nthe law, to pledge fidelity to the Union, to oppose the re-election of\r\nthe President, to denounce repudiation, to demand local\r\nself-government for the Southern States, to ask \"the immediate and\r\nabsolute removal of all disabilities imposed on account of the\r\nrebellion,\" and to favour \"a thorough reform of the civil service;\"\r\nbut for a tariff reform assemblage to frame a resolution which the\r\napostle of protection could accept required great patience and\r\npersistence. The vexatious delay became so intolerable that delegates\r\ninsisted upon making a ticket before adopting a platform. Cochrane\r\nbitterly opposed such a resolution since Greeley's candidacy, if not\r\nhis support of the movement, depended upon the convention's attitude\r\non the tariff. Indeed, not until the committee on resolutions had\r\naccepted what the editor himself dictated was the knotty point finally\r\nsettled. \"Recognising,\" said the platform, \"that there are in our\r\nmidst honest but irreconcilable differences of opinion with regard to\r\nthe respective systems of protection and free-trade, we remit the\r\ndiscussion of the subject to the people in their congressional\r\ndistricts and to the decision of Congress thereon, wholly free from\r\nexecutive interference or dictation.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the resolution was out of keeping with the spirit of the\r\nmovement, it seemed proper to pay this extortionate price for\r\nGreeley's support, since his conspicuous championship of protection\r\nmade it impossible for him to acquiesce in any impairment of that\r\ndoctrine; but the advantage that such a concession gave his candidacy\r\nappears not to have occurred to the leaders who embodied whatever of\r\nprinciple and conviction the convention possessed. Indeed, no scheme\r\nof the managers contemplated his nomination. To many persons Greeley's\r\naspiration took the form of \"a joke.\"[1366] Nor was his name seriously\r\ndiscussed until the delegates assembled at Cincinnati. Even then the\r\nbelief obtained that after a complimentary vote to him and other\r\nfavourite sons, Adams would become their beneficiary. But the work of\r\nFenton quickly betrayed itself. In obedience to a bargain, Gratz Brown\r\nof Missouri, at the end of the first ballot, withdrew in favour of\r\nGreeley, and although Adams held the lead on the next four ballots,\r\nthe strength of Davis and Trumbull shrivelled while Greeley's kept\r\nincreasing. Yet the managers did not suspect a stampede. Eighty per\r\ncent. of the New Yorker's votes came from the Middle and Southern\r\nStates.[1367] Moreover, the Trumbull men held the balance of power.\r\nAfter several notable changes Adams still led by half a hundred. On\r\nthe sixth ballot, however, to the surprise and chagrin of the Adams\r\nmanagers, Trumbull's delegates began breaking to Greeley, and in the\r\nconfusion which quickly developed into a storm of blended cheers and\r\nhisses, Illinois and the Middle West carried the _Tribune's_ chief\r\nbeyond the required number of votes.[1368] Gratz Brown was then\r\nnominated for Vice-President.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1366: New York _Evening Post_, May 4, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1367: Southern States, 104; Middle, 96; New England, 15;\r\nWestern, 19; Pacific, 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1368:\r\n\r\nWhole number of votes    714\r\nNecessary to a choice    358\r\n\r\n          First      Second     Third     Fourth     Fifth     Sixth\r\nAdams      203         243        264       279       309       187\r\nGreeley    147         245        258       251       258       482\r\nTrumbull   110         148        156       141        91        10\r\nDavis       92-1/2      75         44        51        30         6\r\nBrown       95           2          2         2\r\nCurtin      62\r\nChase        2-1/2       1                              2        29]\r\n\r\nGreeley's nomination astounded the general public as much as it\r\ndisappointed the Liberal leaders. Bowles called the result \"a fate\r\nabove logic and superior to reason,\"[1369] but the _Evening Post_\r\nthought it due to \"commonplace chicanery, intrigue, bargaining, and\r\ncompromise.\"[1370] Stanley Matthews, who was temporary chairman of the\r\nconvention, declared himself greatly chagrined at the whole matter. \"I\r\nhave concluded,\" he said, \"that as a politician and a President maker,\r\nI am not a success.\"[1371] Hoadly published a card calling the result\r\n\"the alliance of Tammany and Blair,\" and William Cullen Bryant, Oswald\r\nOttendorfer of the _Staats-Zeitung_, and other anti-protectionists of\r\nNew York, made a fruitless effort to put another candidate before the\r\ncountry.[1372] In the end the _Nation_ and the _Evening Post_ supported\r\nPresident Grant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1369: Merriam, _Life of Bowles_, Vol. 2, p. 210.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1370: New York _Evening Post_, May 4, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1371: Warden, _Life of Chase_, p. 732.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1372: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1872, p. 779.]\r\n\r\nThe nomination deeply mortified the Democrats. They had encouraged the\r\nrevolt, expecting the selection of Adams, or Trumbull, or David Davis,\r\nwhom they could readily adopt, but Greeley, a lifelong antagonist,\r\nplunged them into trouble. No other Republican had so continuously\r\nvilified them. From his introduction to political life in 1840 he had\r\nwaged a constant and personal warfare, often using his strong,\r\nidiomatic English with the ferocity of a Wilkes. A caricature by\r\nGreeley was as much feared as a cartoon by Nast. He spared no one. He\r\nhad assailed Seymour with a violence that might well seem to have made\r\nany form of political reconciliation impossible. With equal skill he\r\nhad aimed his epithets at every Democratic statesman and politician\r\nfrom Van Buren to Fernando Wood, the sting of his relentless and\r\nmerciless criticism goading each one into frenzy. For them now to\r\nassume to overlook such treatment and accept its author as a political\r\nassociate and exemplar seemed a mockery. Several Democratic journals,\r\nfollowing the lead of the _World_, refused to do so, while others,\r\nshrouding their disinclination in a non-committal tone, awaited the\r\nassembling of the State convention which met at Rochester on May 15.\r\nSeymour did not attend this meeting, and although Tilden carefully\r\navoided an expression of opinion, the delegates, after approving the\r\nCincinnati platform, insisted upon referring the choice of candidates\r\nto the national convention, sending John T. Hoffman as a\r\ndelegate-at-large to represent them.\r\n\r\nOne month later the Democratic national convention met at\r\nBaltimore.[1373] Although the delegates, especially those from the\r\nSouth, indicated a growing sentiment in favour of Greeley, the absence\r\nof veteran leaders from the North created much comment. Hendricks of\r\nIndiana sent his regrets; Seymour also remained at home; and Tilden,\r\nKernan, and Sanford E. Church found it convenient to be otherwise\r\nengaged. But August Belmont appeared, and for the last time, after\r\ntwelve years of service and defeat as chairman of the national\r\ncommittee, called the convention to order. John T. Hoffman also\r\nappeared. He was the best known if not the wisest delegate in the\r\nconvention, and as he actively joined the Southern leaders in\r\nencouraging the new order of things, it was easy to understand how his\r\nstar might still have been in the ascendant had his political\r\nassociates been content with power without plunder. Samuel S. Cox,\r\nrecently characterised by Greeley as \"our carpet-bag representative\r\nin Congress\" who had \"cast in his lot with thieves,\"[1374] also\r\nsmoothed the way for his critic's nomination. He could forgive if he\r\ndid not forget.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1373: July 9, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1374: New York _Tribune_, November 1, 1871. Cox's election to\r\nCongress from New York occurred in 1870, three years after he became a\r\nresident of the State.]\r\n\r\nNext to Cox sat John Kelly, the new boss of Tammany. The combativeness\r\nindicated by the form of the head was accentuated by the conspicuous\r\njaw, the firm, thin-lipped mouth, and the closely cropped hair and\r\nbeard, already fading into white; but there was nothing rough or\r\nrowdyish in his manner or appearance. He dressed neatly, listened\r\nrespectfully, and spoke in low, gentle tones, an Irish sense of humour\r\nfrequently illuminating a square, kindly face. It was noticeable, too,\r\nthat although he began life as a mason and had handled his fists like\r\na professional, his hands were small and shapely. Kelly had served two\r\nyears as alderman, four years in Congress, and six years as sheriff.\r\nHe had also represented his county in the national conventions of 1864\r\nand 1868. His character for honesty had not been above suspicion. Men\r\ncharged that he was \"counted in\" as congressman, and that while\r\nsheriff he had obtained a large sum of money by illegal methods.[1375]\r\nIn 1868 he suddenly sailed for Europe because of alleged ill-health,\r\nwhere he remained until late in 1871. He was a rich man then.[1376]\r\nNow, at the age of fifty-one, he was destined to make himself not less\r\npowerful or widely known than the great criminal whom he\r\nsucceeded.[1377] With the aid of Tilden, O'Conor, and other men\r\nconspicuous in the reform movement, he had reorganised Tammany in the\r\npreceding April, increasing a new general committee to five hundred\r\nmembers, and with great shrewdness causing the appointment of\r\ncommittees to coöperate with the Bar Association, with the Committee\r\nof Seventy, and with the Municipal Taxpayers' Association. These\r\nrepresented regenerated Tammany. Kelly affected extreme modesty, but\r\nas he moved about the hall of the national convention, urging the\r\nnomination of Greeley, the delegates recognised a master in the art of\r\ncontrolling men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1375: Myers, _History of Tammany_, pp. 301, 305.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1376: _Ibid._, pp. 261 and note, 300 and 301.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1377: \"About the same time, and in adjoining city districts,\r\ntwo bosses entered upon public life. While Tweed was learning to make\r\nchairs, Kelly was being taught grate-setting. While Tweed was amusing\r\nhimself as a runner with a fire engine, Kelly was captain of the\r\nCarroll Target Guard. Tweed led fire laddies and Kelly dragged about\r\ntarget-shooters upon the eve of elections. Both entered the Board of\r\nAldermen about the same time. About the same time, too, they went to\r\nCongress. Within a few years of each other's candidacy they ran for\r\nsheriff. Tweed was defeated. Kelly was elected. While Kelly was making\r\nbills as sheriff, Tweed was auditing them in the Board of Supervisors.\r\nTweed became the Tammany boss, and Kelly succeeded him. Tweed fell a\r\nvictim to his greed, Kelly escaped by the Statute of Limitations.\"--New\r\nYork _Times_, October 30, 1875.]\r\n\r\nIf any doubt had existed as to Greeley's treatment at Baltimore, it\r\nquickly disappeared on the assembling of the convention, for the\r\nquestion of nomination or indorsement alone disturbed it. If it\r\nadopted him as its own candidate fear was entertained that Republicans\r\nwould forsake him. On the other hand, it was claimed that many\r\nDemocrats who could only be held by party claims would not respect a\r\nmere indorsement. Southern delegates argued that if Democrats hoped to\r\ndefeat their opponents they must encourage the revolt by giving it\r\nprestige and power rather than smother it by compelling Liberals to\r\nchoose between Grant and a Democrat. The wisdom of this view could not\r\nbe avoided, and after adopting the Cincinnati platform without change,\r\nthe convention, by a vote of 686 to 46, stamped the Cincinnati ticket\r\nwith the highest Democratic authority.[1378] Little heartiness,\r\nhowever, characterised the proceedings. Hoffman, in casting New York's\r\nvote, aroused much enthusiasm, but the response to the announcement\r\nof Greeley's nomination was disappointing. The _Tribune_ attributed it\r\nto the intense heat and the exhaustion of the delegates,[1379] but the\r\n_Nation_ probably came nearer the truth in ascribing it to \"boiled\r\ncrow.\"[1380] This gave rise to the expression \"to eat crow,\" meaning\r\n\"to do what one vehemently dislikes and has before defiantly declared\r\nhe would not do.\"[1381]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1378: Of the 46 opposition votes, James A. Bayard received 6\r\nfrom Delaware and 9 from New Jersey; Jeremiah S. Black 21 from\r\nPennsylvania; William S. Groesbeck 2 from Ohio. There were 8 blanks.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1379: New York _Tribune_, July 11, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1380: July 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1381: Century Dictionary.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nDEFEAT AND DEATH OF GREELEY\r\n\r\n1872\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Republicans of New York welcomed the outcome of the Democratic\r\nnational convention. There was a time in its preliminary stages when\r\nthe Liberal movement, blending principle and resentment, had assumed\r\nalarming proportions. Discontent with the Administration, stimulated\r\nby powerful journals, seemed to permeate the whole Republican party,\r\nand the haste of prominent men to declare themselves Liberals,\r\nrecalling the unhappy division in the last State convention and the\r\nconsequent falling off in the Republican vote, added to the\r\nsolicitude. Moreover, the readiness of the Democrats to approve the\r\nprinciples of the Missouri reformers suggested a coalition far more\r\nformidable than the Philadelphia schism of 1866. That movement was to\r\nresist untried Reconstruction, while the Missouri division was an\r\norganised protest against practices in the North as well as in the\r\nSouth which had become intolerable to men in all parties. Gradually,\r\nhowever, the Republican revolt in New York disclosed limitations which\r\nthe slim attendance at Cincinnati accentuated. Several congressional\r\ndistricts had been wholly unrepresented, and few prominent men had\r\nappeared at Cincinnati other than free-traders and Fenton leaders.\r\nSuch an exhibition of weakness had an exhilarating effect upon\r\nRepublicans, who received the nomination of Greeley with derision.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind the friends of the Administration, meeting in\r\nState convention at Elmira on May 15, sent a delegation to\r\nPhiladelphia, headed by the venerable Gerrit Smith, which boasted that\r\nit was without an office-holder. Three weeks later the Republican\r\nnational convention, amidst great enthusiasm, unanimously renominated\r\nGrant for President. A single ballot sufficed also for the selection\r\nof Henry Wilson of Massachusetts for Vice-President.[1382] The\r\nplatform, to offset the Liberals' arraignment, favoured civil service\r\nreform, the abolition of the franking privilege, the prohibition of\r\nfurther land grants to corporations, an increase in pensions, and \"the\r\nsuppression of violent and treasonable organisations\" in the South.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1382: Wilson received 364-1/2 votes to 321-1/2 for Colfax of\r\nIndiana, who had declared his intention to retire from public life.\r\nWhen, later, he changed his mind, Wilson possessed the advantage.]\r\n\r\nAt their State convention, held in Utica on August 21, Republicans\r\nfelt no fear of factional feuds since the aggressive Fenton leaders\r\nhad passed into the Liberal camp. But reasons for alarm existed. The\r\nelection in 1871, carried by the inspiration of a great popular\r\nuprising in the interest of reform, had given them control of the\r\nLegislature, and when it assembled honest men rejoiced, rogues\r\ntrembled, and Tweed failed to take his seat. The people expected the\r\nshameless Erie ring and its legislation to be wiped out, corrupt\r\njudges to be impeached, a new charter for New York City created, the\r\npurity of the ballot-box better protected, canal management reformed,\r\nand a variety of changes in criminal practice. But it proved timid and\r\ndilatory. At the end of the session the Tweed charter still governed,\r\nthe machinery of the courts remained unchanged, and reforms in canal\r\nmanagement, in elections, and in the city government had been\r\nsparingly granted. In cases of proven dishonesty its action was no\r\nless disappointing. It allowed a faithless clerk of the Senate to\r\nresign without punishment;[1383] it permitted the leaders of the\r\nTammany ring to continue in office; it decided that a man did not\r\ndisqualify himself for a seat in the Senate by taking bribes;[1384] and\r\nit failed to attack the Erie ring until the reign of Jay Gould was\r\ndestroyed by the bold action of Daniel E. Sickles.[1385] Never did a\r\nparty more shamelessly fail in its duty. Even credit for the\r\nimpeachment of the Tweed judges belonged to Samuel J. Tilden. \"That\r\nwas all Tilden's work, and no one's else,\" said Charles O'Conor. \"He\r\nwent to the Legislature and forced the impeachment against every\r\nimaginable obstacle, open and covert, political and personal.\"[1386]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1383: New York _Tribune_, February 15, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1384: _Ibid._, April 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1385: For narration of this _coup de main_, see Morgan Dix,\r\n_Life of John A. Dix_, Vol. 2, pp. 163-167.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1386: _The Century_, March, 1885, p. 734.]\r\n\r\nSuch a record did not inspire the party with confidence, and its\r\nrepresentatives looked for a head to its State ticket who could\r\novercome its shortcomings. Of the names canvassed a majority seemed\r\ninclined to William H. Robertson of Westchester. He had been an\r\nassemblyman, a representative in Congress, a judge of his county for\r\ntwelve years, and a State senator of distinguished service. Although\r\nprudent in utterance and somewhat cautious in entering upon a course\r\nof action, his indefatigable pursuit of an object, coupled with\r\nconspicuous ability and long experience, marked him as one of the\r\nstrong men of New York, destined for many years to direct the politics\r\nof his locality.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a feeling existed that his course in the Senate had\r\nlacked force. The New York _Times_ severely criticised it, regarding\r\nhim too much of a tenderfoot in pushing the reform movement, and on\r\nthe eve of the convention it opposed his candidacy.[1387] The _Times_,\r\nthen the only paper in New York City upon which the party relied with\r\nconfidence to fight its battles, exerted an influence which could\r\nscarcely be overrated. However, it is doubtful if its opposition could\r\nhave avoided Robertson's nomination had not the name of John A. Dix\r\nbeen sprung upon the convention. It came with great suddenness. No\r\nopen canvass preceded it. Thurlow Weed, who had proposed it to nearly\r\nevery convention since 1861, was in Utica, but to Henry Clews, the\r\nwell-known banker, belonged the credit of presenting it \"on behalf of\r\nthe business men of New York.\" The captivating suggestion quickly\r\ncaught the delegates, who felt the alarming need of such a candidate,\r\nand the audience, rising to its feet, broke into cheers, while county\r\nafter county seconded the nomination. One excited delegate, with\r\nstentorian voice, moved that it be made by acclamation, and although\r\nthe Chair ruled the motion out of order, the withdrawal of Robertson's\r\nname quickly opened a way for its passage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1387: August 21, 1872; New York _Tribune_, August 22.\r\n\r\n\"Senator Robertson failed to be governor only from lack of\r\nboldness.\"--_Ibid._, May 8, 1880.]\r\n\r\nThis incident produced a crop of trouble. Because Clews happened to be\r\nthe guest of Conkling, Robertson, grievously disappointed, assumed\r\nthat the Senator had inspired the _coup d'état_, and from that moment\r\nbegan the dislike which subsequently ripened into open enmity. \"As a\r\nmatter of fact,\" wrote Clews, \"Conkling knew nothing of my intention,\r\nbut he was either too proud or too indifferent to public sentiment to\r\nexplain.\"[1388]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1388: Henry Clews, _Fifty Years in Wall Street_, pp. 307-309;\r\nNew York _Herald_, August 22.]\r\n\r\nDix's political course had been a tortuous one. He followed the Van\r\nBurens in 1848, becoming the Barnburners' candidate for governor, and\r\nimmediately preceding the reduction of Fort Sumter advocated the\r\nrestoration of the Missouri compromise, perpetuating slavery in all\r\nterritory south of 36° 30´. After the war he joined President Johnson,\r\npresided at the famous Philadelphia convention in 1866, and in return\r\nreceived appointments as minister to The Hague and later to France.\r\nFor several years, under the changing conditions of Weed's leadership,\r\nhe figured as a possible candidate for governor, first of one party\r\nand then of the other, but the Republicans declined to accept him in\r\n1862 and 1864, and the Democrats refused to take him in 1866. After\r\nPresident Grant had relieved him of the French mission by the\r\nappointment of Elihu B. Washburne, he inclined like Weed himself to\r\nthe Liberal movement until the nomination of Greeley, whom they both\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nSeymour charged Dix with being \"a mercenary man,\" who \"rented out his\r\ninfluence gained from political positions to companies of doubtful\r\ncharacter for large pay.\"[1389] At a later day he sketched his\r\nreadiness \"to change his politics\" for \"a large consideration and pay\r\ndown.\" It was a drastic arraignment. \"Starting out with a view of\r\nbeing an Anti-Mason,\" wrote Seymour, \"he shifted to the Democratic\r\nparty for the office of adjutant-general. He hesitated between Cass\r\nand Van Buren until he was nominated for governor by the Free-Soilers.\r\nHe went back to the Democratic party for the New York post-office\r\nunder Pierce. He went over to Buchanan for a place in the cabinet; and\r\nfrom his Free-Soil views he became so violent for the South that he\r\nwould not vote for Douglas, but supported Breckinridge. After\r\npresiding at an anti-war meeting he went over to Lincoln, when he was\r\nmade a major-general. To get a nomination for the French mission he\r\ntook part with President Johnson. To get confirmed he left him for\r\nGrant. In 1868 he intrigued for a presidential nomination from the\r\nDemocratic party; as in 1866 he had tried to be nominated by the same\r\nparty for the office of governor. I think this history shows that he\r\nvalued his political principles at a high rate, and never sold them\r\nunless he got a round price and pay down.\"[1390]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1389: Bigelow's _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 1, p. 228.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1390: _Ibid._, p. 232.]\r\n\r\nOf the same age as Dix, Weed knew his history perfectly, which during\r\nand after the war resembled his own. But he had faith that Dix's war\r\nrecord would more than offset his political vagaries. \"When there was\r\ndanger that Washington would fall into the hands of the rebels,\" he\r\nsaid, \"Dix severed his relations with the Democratic administration,\r\nand in concert with Secretary Holt, Mr. Stanton, and Mr. Seward,\r\nrendered services which saved the nation's capital. A few weeks\r\nafterward, when in command of Fort McHenry, by a prompt movement\r\nagainst a treasonable design of members of the Legislature, he\r\nprevented Maryland from joining the Secessionists.\"[1391] Moreover,\r\nWeed insisted that conservative Democrats and business men, having\r\nconfidence in his integrity, would vote for him regardless of party.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1391: Barnes' _Life of Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 485.]\r\n\r\nThe platform, endorsing the National Administration, failed to mention\r\nthe record of the Legislature. Praise for members of Congress\r\naccentuated this omission. To enlarge the canal for steam navigation\r\nit favoured an appropriation by the general government.[1392]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1392: The ticket was as follows: Governor, John A. Dix of New\r\nYork; Lieutenant-Governor, John C. Robinson of Broome; Canal\r\nCommissioner, Reuben W. Stroud of Onondaga; Prison Inspector, Ezra\r\nGraves of Herkimer; Congressman-at-large, Lyman Tremaine of Albany;\r\nThurlow Weed declined to head the electoral ticket, but suggested the\r\nname of Frederick Douglass, who was nominated by acclamation.--Barnes,\r\n_Life of Weed_, Vol. 2, p. 486.]\r\n\r\nThe Democrats and Liberals met in separate State conventions at\r\nSyracuse on September 4. In numbers and enthusiasm the Liberals made a\r\ncreditable showing. Many Republicans who had assisted at the birth of\r\ntheir party and aided in achieving its victories, adorned the platform\r\nand filled the seats of delegates. John Cochrane called the convention\r\nto order, Truman G. Younglove, speaker of the Assembly in 1869, acted\r\nas temporary chairman, Chauncey M. Depew became its president, and\r\nReuben E. Fenton, with Waldo M. Hutchins, Archibald M. Bliss, Edwin A.\r\nMerritt, D.D.S. Brown, and Frank Hiscock, served upon the committee of\r\nconference. Among others present were Sinclair Tousey, William\r\nDorsheimer, George P. Bradford, and Horatio N. Twombly. In his speech\r\non taking the chair, Depew, who had attended every Republican State\r\nconvention since 1858, declared that he saw before him the men whom he\r\nhad learned to recognise as the trusted exponents of party policy in\r\ntheir several localities.[1393]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1393: New York _Tribune_, September 6.]\r\n\r\nIn apportioning the State offices the Democrats, after much wrangling,\r\nconceded to the Liberals the lieutenant-governor, prison inspector,\r\nand fifteen of the thirty-four electors. This settlement resulted,\r\namidst much enthusiasm, in the nomination of Depew for lieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats experienced more difficulty in selecting a candidate for\r\ngovernor. The withdrawal of Hoffman, who \"usually made his\r\nappointments to office,\" said John Kelly, \"on the recommendation of\r\nthe Tammany ring and at the solicitation of the Canal ring,\" was\r\ninevitable,[1394] and long before he declined several aspirants had\r\nbetrayed their ambition.[1395] But a decided majority of the delegates,\r\n\"fully four-fifths\" declared the New York _Times_,[1396] preferred\r\nSanford E. Church, then chief judge of the Court of Appeals, who\r\nbecame known as the \"ring candidate.\"[1397] On the other hand, Kernan\r\nhad the support of Tilden, against whom the same combination arrayed\r\nitself that controlled at Rochester in 1871. Although the Tweed ring\r\nhad practically ceased to exist, its friendships, rooted in the rural\r\npress and in the active young men whom it had assisted to positions in\r\nAlbany and New York, blocked the way. Besides, Kernan himself had\r\ninvited open hostility by vigorously supporting Tilden in his crusade\r\nagainst Tammany. Thus the contest became complicated and bitter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1394: New York _Tribune_, August 23, 1872; New York _World_,\r\nSeptember 10, 1874; _Times_, September 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1395: Among them were Augustus Schell of New York, Francis\r\nKernan of Oneida, Allen C. Beach of Jefferson, then lieutenant-governor,\r\nHomer A. Nelson of Dutchess, formerly secretary of state, and Lucius\r\nRobinson of Chemung, the distinguished comptroller.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1396: September 6, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1397: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 1, p. 226.]\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious moment for Tilden. Kelly stood for Schell, Kings\r\nCounty presented Church, and Robinson and Beach held their friends\r\nfirmly in hand. With the skill of an astute leader, however, Tilden\r\nweakened the support of Church by publishing his letters declining to\r\nbe a candidate, and by invoking the influences which emphasised the\r\ndivision between Beach and Schell, gained Robinson for Kernan. The\r\naudacity of such tactics staggered the opposition, and when Beach\r\nsurrendered, Tammany and Kings hastened into line. This led to\r\nKernan's nomination by acclamation.[1398] As further evidence of\r\nharmony Kelly moved the appointment of Tilden as a State\r\ncommitteeman-at-large, and subsequently, on the organisation of the\r\ncommittee, continued him as its chairman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1398: The first ballot resulted as follows: Kernan, 42-1/2;\r\nBeach, 32; Schell, 24-1/2; Nelson, 10; Church, 11; Robinson, 6;\r\nnecessary to a choice, 64.\r\n\r\nThe ticket nominated by the two conventions was as follows: Governor,\r\nFrancis Kernan of Oneida, Democrat; Lieutenant-Governor, Chauncey M.\r\nDepew of Westchester, Liberal; Canal Commissioner, John Hubbard of\r\nChenango, Democrat; Prison Inspector, Enos C. Brooks of Cattaraugus,\r\nLiberal; 1 Congressman-at-large, Samuel S. Cox of New York, Democrat.]\r\n\r\nBoth conventions endorsed the Cincinnati platform, denounced the\r\nLegislature for its failure to expel dishonest members, and charged\r\nthe National Administration with corruption and favoritism. As a\r\nfarewell to the Governor, the Democrats resolved that \"the general\r\nadministration of John T. Hoffman meets the approbation of this\r\nconvention.\"[1399]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1399: New York _Tribune_, September 6, 1872.]\r\n\r\nHoffman's political career closed under circumstances that a more\r\nheroic soul might have avoided. In his last message he had repudiated\r\nthe Ring. He had also made some atonement by authorising such suits\r\nagainst it as Charles O'Conor might advise,[1400] and by vetoing the\r\nCode Amendment Bill, devised by Cardozo and designed to confer\r\nauthority upon the judges to punish the press for attacking the Ring;\r\nbut the facts inspiring Nast's cartoon, which pictured him as the\r\nTammany wooden Indian on wheels, pushed and pulled by the Erie and\r\nTweed combination, had fixed the Governor in the popular mind as the\r\nblind tool of rings. \"I saw him in 1885,\" says Rhodes, \"at the\r\nSchweizerhof in Lucerne. Accompanied by his wife he was driving\r\nthrough Switzerland; and in this hotel, full of his own countrymen, he\r\nsat neglected, probably shunned by many. The light was gone from his\r\neyes, the vigour from his body, the confidence from his manner;\r\nconsciousness of failure brooded in their stead. He had not become\r\ndissipated. Great opportunities missed; this was the memory that\r\nracked him, body and spirit, and left him nerveless and decrepit,\r\ninviting death.\"[1401] He died in Germany in 1888.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1400: Attorney-General Champlain had publicly announced his\r\npurpose to authorise O'Conor to bring such suits before the Committee\r\nof Seventy had had its interview with the Governor.--Tilden's _Public\r\nWritings and Speeches_, Vol. 1, p. 590.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1401: James F. Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n6, p. 401, note.]\r\n\r\nFor mayor of New York, John Kelly nominated Abram R. Lawrence, a\r\nlawyer of ability and integrity, whom the Liberals endorsed. The\r\nanti-Tammany forces, not yet willing to surrender to the new Boss,\r\ndivided their strength, the Apollo Hall Democracy nominating James\r\nO'Brien, its founder, while the associations centring about the\r\nCommittee of Seventy supported William F. Havermeyer, whom the\r\nRepublicans endorsed. Havermeyer had twice been mayor.[1402] He\r\nbelonged among the enemies of jobbery, and although sixty-seven years\r\nof age his mental and physical powers remained unimpaired. The\r\ncontest, thus narrowed to Lawrence and Havermeyer, assured a good\r\nmayor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1402: Elected in 1844 and 1847. Declined a renomination in\r\n1849.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign opened encouragingly for Democrats and Liberals. \"The\r\nantagonisms which civil war has created between the kindred\r\npopulations of our country,\" declared Tilden, in his speech at the\r\nSyracuse convention, \"must be closed up now and forever.\"[1403] This\r\nwas the keynote of his party, and, apart from the personal question\r\nof candidates, was the only serious issue of the campaign. In his\r\nletter of acceptance Greeley added a new phrase to the vocabulary of\r\nthe common people: \"I accept your nomination,\" he said, \"in the\r\nconfident trust that the masses of our countrymen North and South are\r\neager to clasp hands across the bloody chasm.\"[1404]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1403: New York _Tribune_, September 5, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1404: _Ibid._, May 22, 1872.]\r\n\r\nThis was a taking cry, and as the great editor moved across\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, the general demonstration of interest\r\ncreated considerable uneasiness at Republican headquarters. \"His name\r\nhad been honoured for so many years in every Republican household,\"\r\nsays Blaine, \"that the desire to see and hear him was universal, and\r\nsecured to him the majesty of numbers at every meeting.\"[1405]\r\nGreeley's friends interpreted these vast audiences as indications of a\r\ngreat tidal wave which would sweep Grant and his party from power. In\r\nthe latter part of September they confidently counted upon carrying\r\nthe October States. The South's endorsement of the Thirteenth,\r\nFourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, its declaration that the public\r\ncredit must be sacredly maintained, and its denunciation of\r\nrepudiation in every form and guise, created the belief that the North\r\nand South would, indeed, \"clasp hands across the bloody chasm.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1405: _Twenty Years in Congress_, Vol. 2, p. 534.]\r\n\r\nIn New York, however, although the Democratic leaders stood loyally by\r\ntheir candidate, pushing Kernan boldly to the front wherever Greeley\r\nseemed weak, the inequality of the fight was apparent. Tammany and\r\nold-time Democrats could not forget that the _Tribune's_ editor had\r\nclassed them with blacklegs, thieves, burglars, gamblers, and keepers\r\nof dens of prostitution.[1406] Moreover, only three Republican\r\nnewspapers had declared for Greeley,[1407] while many leaders like\r\nLyman Tremaine and James W. Husted, whose criticism of the President\r\nhad encouraged the belief that they would favour the Cincinnati\r\nnominee, preferred Grant.[1408] Besides, the business men of the\r\ncountry thought the Republican party without Greeley safer than the\r\nDemocratic party with Greeley.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1406: \"We asked our contemporary [_World_] to state frankly\r\nwhether the pugilists, blacklegs, thieves, burglars, keepers of dens\r\nof prostitution, etc., etc., who make up so large a share of our\r\ncity's inhabitants, were not almost unanimously Democrats.\"--_Tribune_,\r\nJanuary 4, 1868.\r\n\r\n\"So every one who chooses to live by pugilism, or gambling, or\r\nharlotry, with nearly every keeper of a tippling house, is politically\r\na Democrat.... A purely selfish interest attaches the lewd, ruffianly,\r\ncriminal and dangerous class to the Democratic party by the instinct\r\nof self-preservation.\"--_Ibid._, January 7. Conkling quoted these\r\nextracts in his Cooper Institute speech of July 23.--New York _Times_,\r\nJuly 24, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1407: New York _Tribune_, Syracuse _Herald_, and Watertown\r\n_Times_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1408: New York _Tribune_, August 22.]\r\n\r\nAfter the Cincinnati convention a Republican Congress passed a General\r\nAmnesty Act, approved May 22, and in the interest of \"a free breakfast\r\ntable\" placed tea and coffee on the free list. The reduction of the\r\npublic debt at the rate of one hundred millions a year, as well as\r\nlarge annual reductions in the rate of taxation, also inspired\r\nconfidence, while to the President and his Secretary of State belonged\r\ngreat credit for the Geneva arbitration. This amicable and dignified\r\nadjustment of differences between England and the United States,\r\nleading to new rules for the future government of Anglo-American\r\nrelations, and making impossible other than a friendly rivalry between\r\nthe two nations, sent a thrill of satisfaction through the American\r\npeople. Until then the settlement of such irritating questions had not\r\ncome by the peaceful process of law.\r\n\r\nAs the campaign progressed both sides indulged in bitter\r\npersonalities. In his Cooper Institute speech, an address of great\r\npower, Conkling's invective and sarcasm cut as deeply as Nast's\r\ncartoons.[1409] Greeley's face, dress, and manners readily lent\r\nthemselves to caricature. \"I have been assailed so bitterly,\" wrote\r\nGreeley, \"that I hardly knew whether I was running for President or\r\nthe Penitentiary.\"[1410] The _Tribune_ told of a negro woman who was\r\nheard cursing him in the streets of an Ohio river town because he had\r\n\"sold her baby down South before the war.\"[1411] Grant did not escape.\r\nIndeed, he was lampooned until he declared that \"I have been the\r\nsubject of abuse and slander scarcely ever equalled in political\r\nhistory.\"[1412]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1409: New York _Times_, July 24. \"The longest and greatest\r\ncampaign speech of his life.\"--Alfred R. Conkling, _Life of Conkling_,\r\np. 436.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1410: Hollister's _Life of Colfax_, p. 387, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1411: The same article enumerates some of the charges\r\npublished against him: \"In Washington he was a briber. In Albany he\r\nwas the head of the lobby. In New York he was a partner in the Ring\r\nfrauds. He defended the rascalities of Tweed. He sold the influence of\r\nhis paper to Tammany Hall. He intrigued to restore the thieves to\r\npower. He was involved in schemes for robbing the national treasury.\r\nHe was plotting the payment of the Confederate debt. He had promised\r\npensions to Rebel soldiers. He was an original Secessionist. He was\r\nonce a slave-trader in Memphis. He was the friend of the Ku-Klux and\r\nballot-box stuffers.... Dix blamed him for expressing ten or twelve\r\nyears ago sentiments identical with those of Dix himself.\"--New York\r\n_Tribune_, November 22, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1412: _Messages and Papers of the Presidents_, Richardson,\r\nVol. 7, p. 223.]\r\n\r\nEarly elections increased Republican confidence. North Carolina, then\r\na doubtful State, gave a Republican majority in August.[1413] Vermont\r\nand Maine followed in September, and Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana\r\npractically settled the question in October. Finally, the election on\r\nNovember 5 gave Greeley, by small majorities, Georgia, Kentucky,\r\nMaryland, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas, or sixty-six electoral votes\r\nto two hundred and seventy-two for Grant, whose popular majority\r\nexceeded three-quarters of a million. Dix carried New York by 55,451\r\nmajority.[1414] Of thirty-two congressmen the Republicans elected\r\ntwenty-three, with a legislative majority of seventy on joint ballot.\r\nTo the surprise of Tammany, Havermeyer was elected mayor by over 8,000\r\nplurality, although Greeley carried the city by 23,000 majority.[1415]\r\nA comparison of the vote with that cast for Seymour in 1868 showed\r\nthat a marked percentage of Democrats refused to support Greeley, and\r\nthat a larger percentage did not vote at all.[1416] Other slights\r\nadded to his disappointment. \"I was an Abolitionist for years,\" he\r\nsaid, \"when to be one was as much as one's life was worth even here in\r\nNew York, and the negroes have all voted against me. Whatever of\r\ntalents and energy I have possessed, I have freely contributed all my\r\nlife long to Protection; to the cause of our manufactures. And the\r\nmanufacturers have expended millions to defeat me.

Julian, _Political Recollections_, p. 348.]\r\n\r\nBefore the vote of the State was officially canvassed Greeley had gone\r\nto his rest.[1418] The campaign had overtaxed his strength, and upon\r\nhis return from the western speaking tour he watched at the bedside of\r\nhis wife until her decease on October 30. After the election he\r\nresumed editorial charge of the _Tribune_, which he formally\r\nrelinquished on the 15th of the preceding May, but it was plain that\r\nthe robust animal spirits which characterised his former days were\r\ngone.[1419] The loss of his wife, the mortification of defeat, the\r\nfinancial embarrassment of his paper, and the exhaustion of his\r\nphysical powers had broken him. The announcement of his death,\r\nhowever, although the public got an early intimation of the cruel work\r\nwhich his troubles were making upon a frame that once seemed to be of\r\niron, came with the shock of sudden calamity. The whole country\r\nrecognised that in the field of his real conquests the most remarkable\r\nman in American history had fallen, and it buried him with the\r\nappreciation that attends a conqueror. At the funeral President Grant,\r\nVice-President Colfax, and the Vice-President-elect, Henry Wilson,\r\nrode in the same carriage.[1420]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1418: He died November 29, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1419: \"In the darkest hour my suffering wife left me, none\r\ntoo soon for she had suffered too deeply and too long.

There was no delay and no\r\nopposition. Cornell was in the watch-tower as speaker of the Assembly\r\nand other lieutenants kept guard in the lobbies.[1421] The Republican\r\ncaucus nominated on the 8th and the election occurred on the\r\n21st.[1422] A few months later (November 8) the President, in\r\ncomplimentary and generous terms, offered Conkling the place made\r\nvacant by the death of Chief Justice Chase (May 7). His industry and\r\nlegal training admirably fitted him for the position, but for reasons\r\nnot specified he declined the distinguished preferment just as he had\r\nrefused in December, 1870, the offer of a law partnership with an\r\nannual compensation of fifty thousand dollars. Probably the suggestion\r\nthat he become a presidential candidate influenced his decision,\r\nespecially as the President favoured his succession.[1423]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1421: Cornell resigned as surveyor of the port and was\r\nelected to the Assembly.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1422: The Democrats voted for Charles Wheaton of Dutchess,\r\ndistinguished locally as a county judge.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1423: Alfred R. Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, p. 451.]\r\n\r\nAt this time Conkling, then forty-four years old, may be said to have\r\nreached the height of his power, if not of his fame. His opponents\r\nwere under his feet. Greeley was dead, Fenton's long and successful\r\ncareer had closed in the gloom of defeat and the permanent eclipse of\r\nhis influence in public affairs, and others were weakened if not\r\ndestroyed by their party desertion. Moreover, the re-election of a\r\nPresident whom he had supported and defended with an opulent\r\nvocabulary that made his studied addresses models of speech, continued\r\nhis political control. About half a dozen able lieutenants, holding\r\nfat offices in the great patronage centres, revolved with the fidelity\r\nof planets, while in every custom-house and federal office in the\r\nState trained politicians performed the function of satellites. To\r\nharness the party more securely hundreds of young men, selected from\r\nthe various counties because of their partisan zeal, filled the great\r\ndepartments at Washington. \"In obedience to this system,\" said George\r\nWilliam Curtis, \"the whole machinery of the government is pulled to\r\npieces every four years. Political caucuses, primary meetings, and\r\nconventions are controlled by the promise and expectation of\r\npatronage. Political candidates for the lowest or highest positions\r\nare directly or indirectly pledged. The pledge is the price of the\r\nnomination, and when the election is determined, the pledges must be\r\nredeemed. The business of the nation, the legislation of Congress, the\r\nduties of the departments, are all subordinated to the distribution of\r\nwhat is well called spoils.\"[1424]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1424: Report of Civil Service Commission, 1871, p. 18.]\r\n\r\nPresident Grant is quoted as declaring that the Senator never sought\r\nan appointment from him.[1425] This statement is probably true, but not\r\non the theory of the Latin maxim, _Qui facit per alium, facit per\r\nse_.[1426] No occasion existed for him to make requests since his\r\nagents, well known to the President, cabinet, and collectors, could\r\nobtain the necessary appointments without the Senator's participation\r\nor even knowledge. Nevertheless, he relied upon public patronage as an\r\ninstrument of party and factional success, and uniformly employed it\r\nthroughout his career. The principal objection of the independent\r\npress to his appointment as chief justice implied his devotion to\r\npractical politics and an absence of the quality of true\r\nstatesmanship.[1427] Indeed, in spite of his transcendent gifts, his\r\nhold upon party and people was never stronger than the machine's,\r\nsince the influence of his control tended to transform political\r\naction into such subserviency that men of spirit, though loving their\r\nparty, frequently held aloof from its service.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1425: Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, p. 656.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1426: \"He who does a thing by the agency of another, does it\r\nhimself.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1427: The _Nation_, December 4, 1873.]\r\n\r\nBut Conkling used only the methods inherited with his leadership, and\r\nto all appearances the grasp of the Republican party in New York in\r\nJanuary, 1873, was as firm as the most ardent partisan could desire.\r\nThis feeling controlled the State convention at Utica on September 24\r\nto such a degree that its action resembled the partisan narrowness of\r\na ward caucus. Conkling did not attend, but his lieutenants, evidently\r\nconsidering the party vote as a force which only needed exhortation or\r\nintimidation to bring out, dropped Barlow, the attorney-general,\r\nwithout the slightest regard to public sentiment, and visited the\r\npenalty of party treason upon Thomas Raines, the State treasurer, for\r\nhis support of Greeley. From a party viewpoint perhaps Raines deserved\r\nsuch treatment, but Francis C. Barlow's conduct of his office had been\r\ncharacterised by the superb daring with which he met the dangers and\r\ndifficulties of many battlefields, making him the connecting link\r\nbetween his party and the Reform movement. He had prosecuted the Erie\r\nspoilers, and was then engaged in securing the punishment of the\r\nTammany ring. O'Conor spoke of his \"austere integrity\" in refusing to\r\naccept millions as a compromise.[1428] Moreover it was conceded that\r\nBarlow, with the possible exception of Tilden and O'Conor, knew more\r\nof the canal frauds than any one in the State. The list of suits\r\nbrought by him showed the rottenness of the whole system of canal\r\nmanagement, while a recent letter, denouncing a leader of the Ring,\r\ndid not veil his hostility to its individual members.[1429] This\r\nattack, boldly directed against a prominent Republican, aroused the\r\nfierce opposition of the contract manipulators, whose influence\r\nsufficed not only to defeat him, but to nominate the very man he had\r\naccused.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1428: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 1, p. 245.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1429: This letter, dated September 14, 1874, is published in\r\nnearly all the State papers of September 18. It is given in full in\r\nthe New York _Herald_ and _Times_.\r\n\r\nSanford E. Church, in a published interview, charged that the story of\r\nhis connection with the ring originated with Barlow.--New York\r\n_Tribune_, April 2, 1875.]\r\n\r\nTo add to its shame the party in New York City made a bargain with\r\nApollo Hall, an organisation gotten up by James O'Brien, the\r\nex-sheriff, for the purpose of selling to the highest bidder. In 1871\r\nby skilful manoeuvres the party freed itself from any suspicion of\r\nan alliance with this faction, and had thus to a very great extent\r\nobtained the direction of the Reform movement; but now, by dropping\r\nBarlow, ignoring his disclosures, and accepting O'Brien's offer,\r\nalready rejected by Tammany with contempt, it sacrificed its hold upon\r\nthe solid part of the community which had been taught that a vote for\r\nthe Republican ticket was the only way to obtain the fruits of\r\nreform.[1430]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1430: The ticket presented was as follows: Secretary of\r\nState, Francis S. Thayer, Rensselaer; Comptroller, Nelson K. Hopkins,\r\nErie; Treasurer, Daniel G. Fort, Oswego; Attorney-General, Benj. D.\r\nSilliman, Kings; Canal Commissioner, Sidney Mead, Cayuga; State\r\nEngineer, William B. Taylor, Oneida; Prison Inspector, Moss K. Platt,\r\nEssex.]\r\n\r\nAt the Democratic convention which met in Utica on October 1, Thomas\r\nRaines, whose adhesion to Greeley had made him a martyr, was nominated\r\nby acclamation. Here, however, the enthusiasm ended. The overwhelming\r\ndefeat of the previous year had sapped the party of confidence, and\r\ncandidates whom the convention desired refused to accept, while those\r\nit nominated brought neither prominence nor strength.[1431] The\r\nplatform denounced the \"salary grab,\" passed in the closing hours of\r\nthe last Congress, and condemned the Crédit Mobilier disclosures which\r\nhad recently startled the country and disgraced Congress.[1432] Through\r\nits executive committee the Liberal party indorsed the Democratic\r\nnominees except for comptroller and prison inspector. For these\r\noffices it preferred the Republicans' choice of Hopkins and Platt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1431: The following ticket was nominated: Secretary of State,\r\nDiedrich Willers, Seneca; Comptroller, Asher P. Nichols, Erie;\r\nTreasurer, Thomas Raines, Monroe; Attorney-General, Daniel Pratt,\r\nOnondaga; Canal Commissioner, James Jackson, Niagara; State Engineer,\r\nSylvanus H. Sweet, Albany; Prison Inspector, George W. Mellspaugh,\r\nOrange.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1432: James Brooks was the only New York congressman\r\nimplicated. The committee, finding him guilty of corruption as a\r\nmember of the House and as a government director of the Union Pacific\r\nRailroad, recommended his expulsion, but on February 27, 1873, the\r\nHouse, by a vote of 174 to 32 (34 not voting) changed the sentence to\r\none of censure. Brooks died on April 30 following.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the financial crash which began on September 18 by the\r\nfailure of Jay Cooke & Co., spread an intense gloom over the State as\r\nwell as the country, and although by the middle of October the panic,\r\nproperly defined, had ended, a commercial crisis continued. By\r\nNovember 1 several railroads had defaulted in the payment of interest\r\non their bonds, cotton and iron mills had closed, and many labourers\r\nwere thrown out of employment. Criticism of the Administration's\r\nfinancial policy naturally followed, and men whose purchasing power\r\nhad ceased turned against the Republicans, giving the State to the\r\nDemocrats by 10,000 majority. With the aid of the Liberals, Hopkins\r\nand Platt received about 4,000 majority. On the question of electing\r\nor appointing judges, the people by an overwhelming vote pronounced in\r\nfavour of election.\r\n\r\nAs in other \"off years\" the result of this contest indicated a general\r\ndrift of political opinion. Ever since the Republican party came into\r\npower ebbs and flows had occurred at alternating biennial periods. A\r\nDemocratic revival in 1862 followed Lincoln's election in 1860; his\r\nre-election in 1864 saw a similar revival in 1865; and Grant's\r\ndecisive vote in 1868 brought a conservative reaction in 1870. It was\r\nperhaps natural to expect that after the President's re-election in\r\n1872 something of the kind would happen in 1873. Nevertheless, Samuel\r\nJ. Tilden saw in the result something more than the usual reaction. He\r\nbelieved the failure of the Republicans to associate themselves\r\nintimately with reformers and to manifest a loathing for all corrupt\r\nalliances, had added greatly to their burden, and early in the summer\r\nof 1874 he determined to run for governor.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Europe in the early fall of 1873 Tilden had found\r\nthoughtful men of both parties talking of him as a successor to Dix.\r\nTo them the trials of Tweed and his confederates made it plain that\r\nsubstantial reform must begin at Albany, and they wanted a man whose\r\nexperience and success in dealing with one Ring rendered it certain\r\nthat he would assault and carry the works of the other. But Tilden was\r\ncunning. He betrayed no evidence of his desire until others confessed\r\ntheir unwillingness to take the nomination. To the average\r\noffice-seeker running against Dix and his plurality of 55,000 was not\r\nan attractive race. Meanwhile John Kelly, realising the value of\r\nappearing honest, indicated a preference for Tilden.\r\n\r\nThere was something magnetic about the suggestion. Tilden was able,\r\nrich, and known to everybody as the foe of the Tweed ring. Besides he\r\nwas capable, notwithstanding his infirmity, of making a forceful\r\nspeech, full of fire, logic and facts, his quick, retentive memory\r\nenabling him to enter easily into political controversy. As a powerful\r\nreasoner it was admitted that he had few equals at the bar. Indeed,\r\nthe press, crediting him with courage, perseverance, and indomitable\r\nindustry, had pictured him as a successful leader and an ideal\r\nreformer. Tilden himself believed in his destiny, and when, at last,\r\nthe time seemed ripe to avow his candidacy he carried on a canvass\r\nwhich for skill, knowledge of human nature, and of the ins and outs of\r\npolitics, had rarely been approached by any preceding master. The\r\npress of the State soon reflected the growing sentiment in his favour.\r\n\"In selecting him,\" said George William Curtis, \"the party will\r\ndesignate one of its most reputable members.\"[1433] The New York\r\n_Times_ spoke of him as a \"man of unsullied honour,\"[1434] and the\r\n_Tribune_ declared that \"his career in office, should he be elected,\r\nwould be distinguished alike by integrity, decorum, administrative\r\nability, and shrewd political management.\"[1435]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1433: _Harper's Weekly_, September 10, 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1434: July 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1435: September 18.]\r\n\r\nAs one county after another instructed its delegates for Tilden,\r\nprofessional politicians exhibited much astonishment. To the Canal\r\nring the trend of public sentiment toward a man of his record and\r\nindependence was especially ominous. Suddenly, such violent opposition\r\nappeared that the New York _Herald_, studying the Democratic papers in\r\nthe State, declared that outside of New York City only the Utica\r\n_Observer_, which was influenced by Kernan, favoured his\r\nnomination.[1436] It was openly charged that selfish ambition prompted\r\nhis prosecution of the Tweed frauds, and that he was a cunning\r\nschemer, cold, reticent, and severe. Then men began to dissuade him.\r\nFriends counselled him not to take the risk of a nominating\r\nconvention. Even Seymour, moved perhaps by ambitions of his own,\r\ndiscouraged him. If nominated, he wrote, you must expect the martyr's\r\ncrown. \"There has been a widespread plan to carry the convention\r\nagainst you. It was started last winter, and it shaped laws and\r\nappointments. The State officers are against you.... You will find the\r\nsame combination at Syracuse that controlled at Rochester in 1871....\r\nOur people want men in office who will not steal, but who will not\r\ninterfere with those who do.\"[1437] Coupled with this opposition was\r\nthe suggestion that Sanford E. Church, being in no wise identified\r\nwith the Ring prosecutions, would make a more available candidate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1436: New York _Herald_, September 7, 1874. See also Buffalo\r\n_Courier_, September 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1437: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 1, pp. 221-222.]\r\n\r\nEarlier in the year Church, in an interview with Tilden, had declined\r\nto become a candidate, but afterward, as in 1872, he grew anxious for\r\nthe honour, and finally gave Joseph Warren of the Buffalo _Courier_ a\r\nwritten consent to accept if nominated with the concurrence of other\r\ncandidates.[1438] Armed with this statement and with letters of\r\nwithdrawal from others associated with the gubernatorial nomination,\r\nWarren sought Tilden with confidence. By prearrangement their meeting\r\noccurred on September 8 at the Delavan House in Albany. Several were\r\npresent--Jarvis Lord, a senator from Rochester and an extensive canal\r\ncontractor, DeWolf of Oswego, and other canal men. In the room\r\nadjoining Reuben E. Fenton waited.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1438: For copy of this statement see New York _World_,\r\nSeptember 10, 1874.]\r\n\r\nTilden was not surprised at the latter's presence. He knew that in the\r\nevent of his withdrawal, Fenton intended that the Liberals should\r\nnominate Church at their convention which assembled in Albany two days\r\nlater.[1439] But Tilden, long familiar with the Ring's methods, refused\r\nto withdraw. On no theory could they make it appear to be his duty,\r\nand the longer they talked the more determined he became. Then John\r\nKelly, in a published interview, gave Church's aspiration its death\r\nblow. \"DeWolf of Oswego, Warren of Erie, and Senator Lord of Monroe,\"\r\nhe said, \"belong to what is called the Canal ring.... It has been\r\ntheir policy to control a majority of the canal board to enable them\r\nto control the canal contracts.... They have always been very friendly\r\nto Judge Church and of great assistance to him personally.... There\r\nwas friendship existing between the old Tammany ring and this Canal\r\nring.\"[1440] John Bigelow, the friend of Tilden, subsequently used\r\nstronger phrases. \"Tilden knew the Canal ring had no more servile\r\ninstrument in the State than the candidate they were urging. Church\r\nwas poor; he was ambitious; he was not content with his place on the\r\nbench, and was only too ready at all times to combine with anybody on\r\nany terms to secure wealth and power.\"[1441] To Kelly's charges the\r\nBuffalo _Courier_ retorted that \"Tammany Hall under honest John Kelly\r\nis exactly the same as Tammany Hall under dishonest William M.\r\nTweed.\"[1442]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1439: Buffalo _Courier_, September 11; New York _Herald_,\r\nSeptember 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1440: New York _World_, September 10, 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1441: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 1, p. 226. See also the\r\n_Nation_, September 10, 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1442: September 11. Reprinted from the Rochester _Union_ of\r\nSeptember 4.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Democratic State convention met a week later war existed\r\nbetween Kelly and the Canal ring.[1443] Warren intensified it by giving\r\nthe Syracuse _Standard_ a despatch declaring that Kelly's robberies\r\nwhile sheriff were as criminal as those of Garvey's and Ingersoll's of\r\nthe Tweed ring.[1444] In the furious assault upon Tilden no reasons\r\nappeared other than the fear of the Canal ring that his administration\r\nwould lead to its discomfiture. Indeed, the flankers of the reform\r\nmovement found it difficult to agree upon a candidate, and when Amasa\r\nJ. Parker finally consented to stand he did so to gratify Church's\r\nfriends in the middle and western portions of the State, who resented\r\nthe Kelly interview. That the bad blood between the Warren and Kelly\r\nfactions did not break out in the convention was probably due to\r\nSeymour's conciliatory, tactful remarks. A single ballot, however,\r\nbanished the thought of setting Tilden aside for some man less\r\nobnoxious to the Ring.[1445]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1443: September 16 and 17, at Syracuse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1444: New York _World_, September 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1445: Tilden, 252; Parker, 126; Robinson, 6.]\r\n\r\nThe convention was not less fortunate in its selection of William\r\nDorsheimer of Buffalo for lieutenant-governor. Many delegates,\r\ndesiring a Democrat who would inspire enthusiasm among the younger\r\nmen, preferred Smith M. Weed of Clinton, resourceful and brilliant, if\r\nunembarrassed by methods; but he succumbed to the earnest appeals of\r\nDeWitt C. Littlejohn in behalf of Liberal recognition.[1446] Dorsheimer\r\npossessed almost all the qualities that go to make up success in\r\npolitics. He had courage and tact, fascination and audacity, rare\r\nskill on the platform, creditable associations, and marked literary\r\nattainments. Moreover, he had given up a United States attorneyship to\r\nfollow Greeley.[1447] Not less helpful was the platform, drafted by\r\nSeymour, which abounded in short, clear, compact statements, without\r\nbuncombe or the least equivocation. It demanded the payment of the\r\npublic debt in coin, the resumption of specie payment, taxation for\r\nrevenue only, local self-government, and State supervision of\r\ncorporations. It also denounced sumptuary laws and the third term.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1446: William Dorsheimer, 193; Weed, 155; Stephen T. Hoyt of\r\nAllegany (Liberal), 34; Edward F. Jones of Broome (Liberal), 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1447: He was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Northern\r\nDistrict of New York on March 28, 1867. His successor's commission was\r\ndated March 23, 1871.--_State Department Records._\r\n\r\nThe ticket nominated was as follows: Governor, Samuel J. Tilden, New\r\nYork; Lieutenant-Governor, William Dorsheimer, Erie; Court of Appeals,\r\nTheodore Miller, Columbia; Canal Commissioner, Adin Thayer,\r\nRensselaer; Prison Inspector, George Wagner, Yates.]\r\n\r\nAlthough John Kelly aided in nominating Tilden, his desire for\r\nanti-ring candidates did not extend to the metropolis. William F.\r\nHavermeyer's sudden death in November made necessary the election of a\r\nmayor, and Kelly, to keep up appearances, selected William H. Wickham,\r\nhis neighbour, an easy-going diamond merchant, whose membership on the\r\nCommittee of Seventy constituted his only claim to such\r\npreferment.[1448] But here all semblance of reform disappeared. James\r\nHayes, charged with making half a million dollars during the Tweed\r\nrégime, became the candidate for register, and of fifteen persons\r\nselected for aldermen nine belonged to the old Ring, two of whom were\r\nunder indictment for fraud.[1449] Evidently Warren did not betray\r\nignorance when he pronounced the new Tammany no better than the old.\r\nThe Republicans presented Salem H. Wales for mayor, while the\r\nGermans, declining to act with Kelly, selected Oswald Ottendorfer, the\r\neditor, a most able and upright citizen who had proven his fidelity to\r\nthe reform movement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1448: \"Wickham has no conception beyond making a pleasant\r\nthing for himself and our friends out of the seat which he occupies.\"\r\nLetter of Charles O'Conor.--Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 1, p.\r\n245.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1449: Myers, _History of Tammany Hall_, p. 307.]\r\n\r\nThe Republicans renominated John A. Dix with other State officials\r\nelected in 1872,[1450] and had the Custom-house sincerely desired the\r\nGovernor's re-election, the expediency of a coalition with\r\nOttendorfer's supporters must have appealed to it as highly important.\r\nDix had made an admirable executive. His decisions of questions\r\nregardless of men and of the next election excited popular confidence,\r\nand the power of public opinion had forced his renomination by\r\nacclamation. But his independence could not be forgiven. Moreover, the\r\nplatform gave him little assistance. It neither denounced corruption,\r\ndemanded relief from predatory rings, nor disapproved a third term.\r\nExcept as to resumption and the payment of the public debt in coin, it\r\nfollowed the beaten track of its predecessors, spending itself over\r\nSouthern outrages. Although several delegates had prepared resolutions\r\nin opposition to a third term, no one dared present them after\r\nConkling had finished his eulogy of the President.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1450: The convention met at Utica on September 23. The ticket\r\nwas as follows: Governor, John A. Dix, New York; Lieutenant-Governor,\r\nJohn C. Robinson, Broome; Court of Appeals, Alexander S. Johnson,\r\nOneida; Canal Commissioner, Reuben W. Stroud, Onondaga; Prison\r\nInspector, Ezra Graves, Herkimer.]\r\n\r\nThe Liberals who assembled at Albany on September 10 had about\r\nfinished their course as a separate party. Their creed, so far as it\r\nrepresented practical, well-meditated reform, was a respectable,\r\nhealthy faith, but the magnet which attracted the coterie of\r\nRepublicans whose leadership gave it whatever influence it exerted in\r\nthe Empire State was Horace Greeley. When he died their activity\r\nceased. Besides, the renomination of Dix, who had little liking for\r\nthe organisation and no sympathy with a third term, now afforded them\r\ngood opportunity to return to the fold. The Albany convention,\r\ntherefore, represented only a small fraction of the original\r\ndissenters, and these adjourned without action until the 29th. On\r\nreconvening a long, acrimonious discussion indicated a strong\r\ndisposition to run to cover. Some favoured Tilden, others Dix, but\r\nfinally, under the lead of George W. Palmer, the convention, deciding\r\nto endorse no one, resolved to support men of approved honesty, who\r\nrepresented the principles of the Cincinnati convention and opposed a\r\nthird term.[1451]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1451: On June 23 the friends of total abstinence, resenting\r\nDix's veto of a local option measure passed by the Legislature of\r\n1873, assembled at Auburn, approved the organisation of a Prohibition\r\nparty, and nominated a State ticket with Myron H. Clark for governor.\r\nAbout 350 delegates from twenty-five counties were present.]\r\n\r\nAs the days shortened the campaign became more spirited. Tilden,\r\nputting himself in close relation with every school district in the\r\nState, introduced the clever device of mailing a fac-simile of one of\r\nhis communications, thus flattering the receiver with the belief that\r\nhe possessed an autograph letter. His genius for detail kept a corps\r\nof assistants busy, and the effort to inspire his desponding partisans\r\nwith hope of success made each correspondent the centre of an earnest\r\nband of endeavourers. Meanwhile the Democratic press kept up a galling\r\nfire of criticism. Dix had escaped in 1872, but now the newspapers\r\ncharged him with nepotism and extravagance. \"Governor Morgan had two\r\naides in time of war,\" wrote Seymour, \"while Dix has six in time of\r\npeace. Morgan had one messenger, Dix has two. Morgan had a secretary\r\nat $2,000; Dix had the pay put up to $3,500--and then appointed his\r\nson.... The people think the Governor gets $4,000; in fact, under\r\ndifferent pretexts it is made $14,000.\"[1452] An attempt was also made\r\nto connect him with the Crédit Mobilier scandal because of his\r\npresidency of the Union Pacific road at the time of the consideration\r\nof the Oakes Ames contract.[1453] That the Governor had no interest in\r\nor connection with the construction company availed him little. Other\r\nmen of approved honesty had become involved in the back-salary grab,\r\nthe Sanborn claims, and the Crédit Mobilier, and the people, quickly\r\ndistrusting any one accused, classed him with the wrong-doers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1452: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 1, p. 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1453: Morgan A. Dix, _Life of Dix_, Vol. 2, pp. 128, 149.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, Dix laboured under the disadvantage of having apathetic\r\nparty managers. \"They deliberately refused to support him,\" said his\r\nson, \"preferring defeat to the re-election of one whom they desired to\r\nbe rid of.\"[1454] Conkling, in his speech at Brooklyn,[1455] rebuked the\r\nspirit of calumny that assails the character of public men, but he\r\nneglected to extol the record of a patriotic Governor, or to speak the\r\nword against a third term which would have materially lightened the\r\nparty burden.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1454: Morgan A. Dix, _Life of Dix_, Vol. 2, pp. 195-196.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1455: October 30, 1874.]\r\n\r\nWhen the opposition press began its agitation of a third term,\r\ncharging that the country was \"drifting upon the rock of\r\nCæsarism,\"[1456] few men believed such an idea sincerely entertained.\r\nNevertheless, as the election approached it aroused popular\r\nsolicitude. Congressmen who hurried to Washington in the hope of being\r\nauthorised to contradict the accusation, returned without an utterance\r\nto disarm their opponents, while the Democrats not only maintained\r\nthat Grant himself was not averse to using his official position to\r\nsecure the nomination, but that eighty thousand office-holders were\r\nplotting for this end.[1457] As the idea had its inception largely in\r\nthe talk of a coterie of Grant's political and personal friends,\r\nConkling's eulogies of the President seemed to corroborate the claim.\r\nSo plainly did the _Times_ stagger under the load that rumours of the\r\n_Tribune's_ becoming a Conkling organ reached the _Nation_.[1458] It\r\ncould not be denied that next to the commercial depression and the\r\ninsolence of the Canal ring, the deep-seated dissatisfaction with\r\nGrant's administration influenced public sentiment. Excluding the\r\ninflation veto the record of his second term had not improved upon the\r\nfirst, while to many his refusal to disclaim the third-term accusation\r\nbecame intolerable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1456: New York _Herald_, July 7, 1873.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1457: The _Nation_, October 29, 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1458: April 16, 1874.]\r\n\r\nThe municipal contest in New York City also developed embarrassments.\r\nBarring a few appointments Havermeyer had made a fair record, having\r\nimproved the public school system, kept clean streets, and paid much\r\nattention to sanitary conditions. Moreover, he distributed the revenue\r\nwith care, and by the practice of economy in the public works reduced\r\nexpenses nearly eight millions. The winter of 1873-4 proved a severe\r\none for the unemployed, however, and to catch their votes Kelly, with\r\ngreat adroitness, favoured giving them public employment. This was a\r\npowerful appeal. Fifteen thousand idle mechanics in the city wanted\r\nwork more than public economy, while thousands in the poorer\r\ndistricts, seeking and receiving food from Tammany, cheered the\r\nturbulent orator as he pictured the suffering due to Havermeyer's\r\npolicy and the hope inspired by Kelly's promises.\r\n\r\nHavermeyer's accusations against Kelly also recoiled upon his party.\r\nIn the course of a bitter quarrel growing out of Kelly's appointment\r\nof Richard Croker as marshal,[1459] the Mayor publicly charged \"Honest\r\nJohn\" with obtaining while sheriff $84,482 by other than legal\r\nmethods.[1460] \"I think,\" said Havermeyer, \"you were worse than Tweed\r\nwho made no pretensions to purity, while you avow your honesty and\r\nwrap yourself in the mantle of purity.\"[1461] Kelly's prompt denial,\r\nfollowed by a suit for criminal libel, showed a willingness to try the\r\nissue, but Havermeyer's sudden death from apoplexy on the morning of\r\nthe trial (November 30), leaving his proofs unpublished, strengthened\r\nKelly's claim that \"Tammany is the only reform party in existence here\r\nto-day.\"[1462]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1459: Until then Croker had been an attaché of Connolly's\r\noffice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1460: \"No law authorised Kelly to include convictions in the\r\nPolice Courts, yet he did include them, thereby robbing the city of\r\nover thirty thousand dollars. He charged, at one time, double the\r\nrates for conveying prisoners to and from the Island; at another, 133\r\nper cent. more. He charged for 11,000 vagrants committed to the\r\nwork-house, a clear fraud upon the treasury.\"--New York _Times_,\r\nOctober 20, 1875.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1461: New York papers of September 18, 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1462: New York _World_, September 10, 1874.]\r\n\r\nThe Republican press, apparently with effect, enlarged upon the\r\ngeneral excellence of Dix's administration, but early in the campaign\r\nthe people showed greater liking for reform at home than abhorrence of\r\noutrages in the South, and the result proved a political revolution,\r\nTilden receiving a plurality of 50,317 and Dorsheimer 51,488.[1463]\r\nBesides the State ticket the Democrats carried the Assembly and\r\neighteen of the thirty-three congressional districts. With the\r\nexception of James Hayes, who was defeated for register by over 10,000\r\nmajority, Tammany likewise elected its entire ticket.[1464]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1463: In 1872 Dix had 55,451.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1464: Tilden, 416,391; Dix, 366,074; Clark, 11,768;\r\nDorsheimer, 416,714; Robinson, 365,226; Bagg, 11,310.\r\n\r\nNew York City: Tilden, 87,623; Dix, 44,871; Clark, 160; Wickham,\r\n70,071; Wales, 36,953; Ottendorfer, 24,226. Legislature: Assembly,\r\nDemocrats, 75; Republicans, 53. Senate, Democrats, 12; Republicans,\r\n18; Independents, 2. The Senators were elected in 1873.]\r\n\r\nDemocratic success was not confined to New York. Small majorities were\r\nobtained in Ohio and Indiana as well as in Pennsylvania and\r\nMassachusetts, and for the first time since 1861 the House of\r\nRepresentatives passed into the control of that party. The financial\r\ndepression plainly operated to the great advantage of the Democrats,\r\nbut in allowing Tilden to pre-empt the reform issue when men were\r\nintent upon smashing rings, the Republicans opened the door for their\r\ndestruction. \"They [the Republican leaders] have apparently believed\r\nthe people would submit to anything and everything,\" said the _Times_,\r\n\"and that the party was indestructible. If a newspaper warned them in\r\na friendly but firm spirit against the policy of blundering, it was\r\ntreated with a mixture of the insolence and arrogance which they\r\nexhibited toward all opposition.\"[1465]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1465: New York _Times_, November 4, 1874.\r\n\r\nEleven amendments to the Constitution were ratified at this election.\r\nThose relating to political matters required thirty days' residence in\r\nan election district; abolished property qualification, thus removing\r\nall distinction between white and coloured voters; fixed the pay of\r\nlegislators at $1500 per year, without limiting the length of a\r\nsession; changed the terms of governor and lieutenant-governor from\r\ntwo to three years, with salaries of $10,000 and $5,000, respectively;\r\nrequired two-thirds of all the members elected to each house to\r\noverride the governor's veto; authorised the veto of individual items\r\nin an appropriation act; and prohibited extra compensation being paid\r\nto a canal contractor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nRIVALRY OF TILDEN AND CONKLING\r\n\r\n1875\r\n\r\n\r\nIf further evidence of Tilden's supremacy in his party were needed,\r\nthe election of Francis Kernan to the United States Senate furnished\r\nit. It had been nearly thirty years since the Democrats of New York\r\nwere represented in the Senate, and Tilden sent his staunchest\r\nsupporter to take the place of Fenton.[1466] This fidelity disturbed\r\nthe members of the Canal ring, who now anxiously awaited the\r\ndevelopment of the Governor's policy. The overthrow of the Tammany\r\nring and the memory of Tweed's fate hung about them like the shadow of\r\na great fear.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1466: The Republicans voted for ex-Governor Edwin D. Morgan,\r\nthe vote standing: Kernan, 87; Morgan, 68; Hoffman, 1.]\r\n\r\nTilden did not strike at once. Treating the matter as he did the Tweed\r\ndisclosures, he secretly studied the methods of the Ring, examined\r\nmore than one hundred contracts, and employed a civil engineer to\r\nverify work paid for with that actually done. So severe was the strain\r\nof this labour that in February he suffered a cerebral attack nearly\r\nakin to paralysis.[1467] Of the character or purpose of his work no one\r\nhad any intimation, and guilty men who obsequiously complimented him\r\nthought him weak and without the nerve to harm them. But on the 18th\r\nof March (1875) he thrilled the State and chilled the Ring with a\r\nspecial message to the Legislature, showing that for the five years\r\nending September 30, 1874, millions had been wasted because of\r\nunnecessary repairs and corrupt contracts. Upon ten of these\r\nfraudulent contracts the State, it appeared, had paid more than a\r\nmillion and a half, while the proposals at contract prices called for\r\nless than half a million. This result, he said in substance, was\r\nbrought about by a unique contrivance. The engineer designated the\r\nquantity and kinds of work to be done, and when these estimates were\r\npublished by the commissioners, the favoured contractor, learning\r\nthrough collusion what materials would actually be required, bid\r\nabsurdly low prices for some and unreasonably high rates for others.\r\nAfter the contract was let, changes made in accordance with the\r\nprevious secret understanding required only the higher priced\r\nmaterials. Thus the contractor secured the work without competition or\r\nreal public letting.[1468]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1467: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 1, p. 285.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1468: The Governor plainly illustrated this device. The\r\nengineer having estimated the amount of work and materials, the\r\nbidders added their prices.\r\n\r\nA bid as follows:\r\n\r\n100 cubic yards of vertical wall, at $3      $     300.00\r\n3,855 cubic yards of slope wall, at $1.50        5,782.50\r\n2,400 feet B.M. white oak, at $50                  120.00\r\n60,000 feet B.M. hemlock, at $15                   900.00\r\n                                             ------------\r\nTotal estimate of A                          $   7,102.50\r\n\r\nB bid as follows:\r\n\r\n100 cubic yards of vertical wall, at $6      $     600.00\r\n3,855 cubic yards of slope wall, at 30 cents     1,156.50\r\n2,400 feet B.M. white oak, at $70                  168.00\r\n60,000 feet B.M. hemlock, at $3                    180.00\r\n                                             ------------\r\nTotal estimate of B                          $   2,104.50\r\n\r\nB was given the contract as the lowest bidder, after which the work\r\nwas changed as follows:\r\n\r\n3,955 cubic yards of vertical wall, at $6    $  23,730.00\r\n62,400 feet B.M. white oak, at $70               4,368.00\r\n                                             ------------\r\nActually paid B by the State                 $  28,098.00\r\n\r\nOn ten of these contracts, originally amounting to $424,735.90 the\r\nState paid $1,560,769.84.--Tilden's _Public Writings and Speeches_,\r\nVol. 2, pp. 106-108.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor recommended various measures of reform, notably a new\r\nletting after any change in the proposals for bids. He also suggested\r\nan investigation of the frauds already perpetrated, and for this\r\npurpose the Senate confirmed a non-partisan commission,[1469] who\r\nquickly reported that the work of one contractor showed fraudulent\r\nestimates, false measurements, and a charge of $150,337.02 for\r\nexcavations and embankments that were never made. Neither surveys nor\r\nestimates preceded the letting of the contract, while in every\r\ninstance he appeared as the lowest bidder. Eleven additional reports\r\nmade during the year showed that similar frauds were repeatedly\r\npractised by him and other contractors. In each case arrests,\r\nindictments, and suits for restitution promptly followed.[1470] It also\r\nappeared that the auditor of the canal department, a former Republican\r\ncandidate for secretary of state, had made use of his office to\r\nspeculate in canal drafts and certificates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1469: This commission was composed of John Bigelow, Daniel\r\nMagone of Ogdensburg, Alexander E. Orr of Brooklyn, and John D. Van\r\nBuren of New York.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1470: Indictments were found against the son of a State\r\nsenator, a member of the board of canal appraisers, an ex-canal\r\ncommissioner, two ex-superintendents of canals and one division\r\nengineer, besides numerous subordinates and contractors.--See\r\nBigelow's _Life of Tilden_, pp. 262-263; for names of the parties, see\r\nAppleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1875, p. 558.]\r\n\r\nThe excitement over these revelations recalled the indignation\r\nfollowing the Tweed disclosures. Every voter in every corner of the\r\nState knew of them. Furthermore, the arrests of contractors and\r\nofficials along the line of the canal multiplied evidence of the\r\nGovernor's courage. He spared no one. Of the principal officials and\r\nex-officials indicted all save two were Democrats,[1471] but his\r\nadministration knew no party and expressed no concern. Such creditable\r\npublic service made a profound impression, and during a visit to the\r\nwestern part of the State in August, the people accorded him the\r\nattention given to a conqueror. From Albany to Buffalo crowds\r\neverywhere saluted him with bands of music and salvos of artillery,\r\nwhile his addresses, characterised by plainness of speech, deprecated\r\na reactionary policy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1471: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 2, p. 263.]\r\n\r\nThese demonstrations alarmed Republican leaders. They appreciated that\r\nhis adroitness and energy in accumulating proof of Tweed's guilt had\r\nfixed the attention of the country upon him as a presidential\r\ncandidate, and that the assault on the canal spoilers made his\r\npretensions more formidable. Moreover, they realised that their own\r\nfailure to lead in canal reform in 1873, evidenced by ignoring Barlow\r\nand his incriminating disclosures, yielded Tilden a decided advantage\r\nof which he must be dispossessed. To accomplish this two ways opened\r\nto them. Regarding the canal scandal as not a party question they\r\ncould heartily join him in the crusade, thus dividing whatever\r\npolitical capital might be made out of it; or they could disparage his\r\neffort and belittle his character as a reformer. The latter being the\r\neasier because the more tolerable, many Republican papers began\r\ncharging him with insincerity, with trickery, and with being wholly\r\ninfluenced by political aspirations. His methods, too, were criticised\r\nas undiplomatic, hasty, and often harsh. Of this policy _Harper's\r\nWeekly_ said: \"Those who say that the Governor's action is a mere\r\npolitical trick, and that he means nothing, evidently forget that they\r\nare speaking of the man who, when he once took hold of the Tweed\r\nprosecution, joined in pushing it relentlessly to the end.\"[1472]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1472: _Harper's Weekly_, August 28, 1875.]\r\n\r\nThis was the sentiment of George William Curtis, who presided at the\r\nRepublican State convention.[1473] It also became the policy of the\r\nmanagers whom defeat had chastened. They discerned the signs of the\r\ntimes, and instead of repressing hostility to a third term and\r\ndissatisfaction with certain tendencies of the National\r\nadministration, as had been done in 1874, they deemed it wiser to swim\r\nwith the current, meeting new influences and conditions by discarding\r\nold policies that had brought their party into peril. The delegates,\r\ntherefore, by a great majority, favoured \"a just, generous, and\r\nforbearing national policy in the South,\" and \"a firm refusal to use\r\nmilitary power, except for purposes clearly defined in the\r\nConstitution.\" They also commended \"honest efforts for the correction\r\nof public abuses,\" pledged coöperation \"in every honourable way to\r\nsecure pure government and to bring offenders to justice,\" and\r\ndeclared \"unalterable opposition to the election of any President for\r\na third term.\"[1474] Furthermore, the convention sought candidates of\r\nprominence and approved integrity. In the presence of threatened\r\ndefeat such men were shy. William H. Robertson of Westchester thrice\r\ndeclined the comptrollership, and insistence upon his acceptance did\r\nnot cease until James W. Husted, springing to his feet, declared that\r\nsuch demands were evidently intended as an insult. Then Edwin D.\r\nMorgan proposed George R. Babcock, a distinguished lawyer of Buffalo,\r\nwho likewise declined. In a short, crisp letter, John Bigelow,\r\nchairman of the canal investigating committee, rejected the proffered\r\nhonour. Finally, the choice fell upon Francis E. Spinner, formerly\r\nUnited States treasurer, and although he sent two unconsenting\r\ntelegrams, the convention refused to revoke its action. Despite such\r\nembarrassments, however, it secured an array of strong, clean\r\nmen.[1475]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1473: Held at Saratoga on September 8, 1875.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1474: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1875, p. 560.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1475: The ticket was as follows: Secretary of State,\r\nFrederick W. Seward, New York; Comptroller, Francis E. Spinner,\r\nHerkimer; Treasurer, Edwin A. Merritt, St. Lawrence; Attorney-General,\r\nGeorge F. Danforth, Monroe; Engineer, Oliver H.P. Cornell, Tompkins;\r\nCanal Commissioner, William F. Tinsley, Wayne; Prison Inspector,\r\nBenoni J. Ives, Cayuga.]\r\n\r\nA week later the Democrats assembled at Syracuse. They quickly retired\r\nan anti-Tammany delegation led by John Morrissey,[1476] reaffirmed the\r\nplatforms of 1872 and 1874, and nominated John Bigelow for secretary\r\nof state. Bigelow, well known as a former editor of the _Evening Post_\r\nand more recently minister to France, had always been a Republican.\r\nIndeed, Tilden named and a Republican Senate confirmed him as one of\r\ntwo Republicans on a non-partisan board; but for reasons best known to\r\nhimself Bigelow changed his party in the twinkling of an eye.\r\nAssociated with him were John D. Van Buren, also upon the canal\r\ncommission; Lucius Robinson, who won, when comptroller in 1862, great\r\nhonour in the teeth of much obloquy by paying the State interest in\r\ncoin; and Charles S. Fairchild, then a young lawyer earning\r\nsubstantial credit, like Bigelow and Van Buren, in the prosecution of\r\nthe Canal ring.[1477] In naming this ticket Tilden had exhibited his\r\ncharacteristic shrewdness. He exaggerated the partisan aspect of\r\nadministrative reform, and strengthened his candidacy for President by\r\nappropriating the glory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1476: After James Hayes' defeat for register in 1874, Kelly\r\ndeprived Morrissey of his district leadership because he stirred up\r\ndisaffection among the working men and sowed seeds of disloyalty. In\r\ntheir contest the Morrissey and Kelly factions were known as\r\n\"Swallow-tails\" and \"Short-hairs,\" Morrissey, to rebuke Wickham's\r\ncustom of requiring cards of callers in advance of admission to his\r\noffice, having called upon the Mayor during business hours in evening\r\ndress, with white kids and patent-leather pumps.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1477: The ticket was as follows: Secretary of State, John\r\nBigelow, Ulster; Comptroller, Lucius Robinson, Chemung;\r\nAttorney-General, Charles S. Fairchild, New York; Treasurer, Charles\r\nN. Ross, Cayuga; Engineer, John D. Van Buren, New York; Canal\r\nCommissioner, Christopher A. Walruth, Oneida; Prison Inspector, Rodney\r\nR. Crowley, Cattaraugus.\r\n\r\nOn September 22 the Liberals met at Albany. They eulogised Tilden by\r\nname, favored the Greeley doctrine of a single term for President,\r\narraigned the Federal administration, and recommended the support of\r\ncandidates who would coöperate with the Executive in his work of\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nFor governor the Prohibitionists nominated George H. Dusenberre.]\r\n\r\nThe Republican press, quickly interpreting his purpose, now changed\r\nfrom praise to censure, scrutinising and criticising every act in his\r\nlong public career. It reviewed his war record, disclosed his part in\r\nthe convention of 1864, and hinted at uncanny financial transactions.\r\nHis service as the figurehead of Tweed's conventions, and his\r\npassiveness after possessing knowledge of the infamous circular of\r\n1868 to which his name had been forged, also became the subject of\r\nsevere censure. Though he neither shared Tweed's corrupt counsels nor\r\nsanctioned his audacious schemes, Tilden's abhorrence of wrong, it was\r\nargued, seemed insufficient to break his silence. But the accusation\r\nthat cut the deepest, because without palliation, illuminated his\r\ndeclination to attend the great indignation meeting that appointed the\r\nCommittee of Seventy. This fact, established by abundant proof as well\r\nas by his conspicuous absence, created the belief that had the\r\n_Times'_ exposure failed fatally to wound the Ring, he would have\r\nshrunk from defying Tweed.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of such a record it was ludicrous to deny that Tilden,\r\nalthough resembling a reformer, was simply an adroit politician, who\r\nhad cultivated some queer political associates and had countenanced\r\nsome very shady transactions. Nevertheless, Tilden would not be\r\ndiverted from the singleness of his purpose. To make the issue a\r\npersonal one he took the stump and traversed the State from one end to\r\nthe other, always addressing immense crowds. At Utica the contemporary\r\npress estimated the throng at twenty-five thousand persons. With\r\ndirectness and business brevity he sought to arouse the people to the\r\nimportance and gravity of the issues at stake. \"To-day about one-half\r\nof the tax contributed by the farmer,\" he said, \"goes to the State to\r\ncarry on public affairs.... It is in the power of the Legislature and\r\nthe Executive at Albany to reduce this State tax one-half if you send\r\nthe right men.... We began this work last winter. It made great\r\nconflict and turmoil, the attempt to remove the fungus-growths which\r\nhad sprung up all over our State institutions, and which were\r\nsmothering their vitality.... It is not alone the saving of dollars\r\nand cents, for you cannot preserve your present system of government\r\nunless you purify administration and purify legislation.\"[1478]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1478: Address at Utica Fair, September 30, 1875.--Tilden's\r\n_Public Writings and Speeches_, Vol. 2, pp. 229-233.]\r\n\r\nDuring the anti-slavery struggle Tilden's incapacity to measure the\r\nmoral force of public sentiment had undoubtedly kept him in error. He\r\nfailed entirely to appreciate the close connection between rebellion\r\nand slavery, and in finally yielding to the war-failure resolution at\r\nChicago in 1864 he did not realise how completely abolition and a\r\nrestoration of the Union were associated in the hearts of the people.\r\nBut with the advent of the business period, although his bodily\r\npresence was weak and the external elements of popularity were\r\nwanting, his subtle, strong mind and great administrative capacity\r\nbrought him irresistibly to the front, and his shrewd, homely appeals,\r\nwithout mixed metaphors or partisan allusions, reduced the issue of\r\nthe campaign to the attractive one of saving dollars and cents by\r\nprotecting the treasury against the raid of canal spoilers.\r\n\r\nConkling did not attend the Saratoga convention.[1479] But he did not\r\nremain silent during the campaign. The Democratic and independent\r\npress, illuminating the story of Louisiana under carpet-bag-negro rule\r\nwhich culminated in the ejection of members of the Legislature by a\r\nfile of soldiers under command of General Sheridan, had greatly\r\nincreased the disfavour of the Administration's policy toward the\r\nSouth.[1480] So intense had been the excitement following the\r\npublication of Sheridan's despatches that a great indignation meeting\r\ncalled out William Cullen Bryant, then past eighty, who addressed it\r\n\"with the vehemence and fire of a man of thirty.\"[1481] Moreover, the\r\nexposure of the Whiskey ring which began under Bristow, then secretary\r\nof the treasury, added to the advantage of the Democrats. The chief\r\nconspirator figured as Grant's most generous gift-giver, who claimed\r\ncollusion with the President's private secretary. The Executive's\r\nevident displeasure with Bristow also increased the unrest. Indeed, it\r\nseemed a period of exposure. Public opinion had become aroused and\r\ninflamed. \"Great as are the frauds of Tammany,\" said Charles A. Dana,\r\n\"they sink into insignificance not only beside those of the carpet-bag\r\ngovernments of the South, but still more beside those committed by the\r\nRepublican Administration at Washington.\"[1482]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1479: In the summer of 1875 he made a brief visit to\r\nEurope.--Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, p. 490.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1480: See Rhodes' _History of the United States_, Vol. 7, pp.\r\n104-127. Also, Tilden's message to the Legislature, January 12, 1875,\r\n_Public Writings and Speeches_, Vol. 2, pp. 75-84.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1481: Godwin, _Life of Bryant_, p. 357. This meeting was held\r\nJanuary 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1482: New York _Sun_, February 17.]\r\n\r\nThese revelations, however, did not call more loudly for Conkling's\r\ndefence of his party than did the popular applause which everywhere\r\ngreeted the reform Governor. The work and rising fame of Tilden\r\nalarmed the Senator if it did not irritate him. He saw the tremendous\r\nthrong at Utica; he had read the plain, brief, unadorned statement\r\nabout dividing the State-tax by two; and he recognised a rival who had\r\nleaped into the political arena full-armed and eager. Moreover,\r\nConkling was himself a candidate for President. Grant's letter of May\r\n29,[1483] interpreted as a declination to be a candidate for a third\r\nterm, set him free to enter the lists, and the argument of his\r\navailability, based upon his power to carry the pivotal State, made a\r\nRepublican victory in 1875 of the highest importance. For him to take\r\npart in the campaign, therefore, was imperative, and he selected\r\nAlbany as the place and October 13 as the day to begin. Other\r\nengagements followed at Buffalo, Utica, New York, and elsewhere.[1484]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1483: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1875, p. 743.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1484: See remarks of Forster of Westchester, a delegate to\r\nthe Republican State convention of March 22, 1876.--New York\r\n_Tribune_, March 23, 1876.]\r\n\r\nAttracted by the critical situation and an intense curiosity great\r\naudiences greeted him, and hundreds of friends cheered an address,\r\nwhich, as usual, contained from his point of view the whole Republican\r\ncase. He recited the Democratic party's history during the war;\r\ndescribed reformers as selfish, hypocritical, and pure, placing\r\nRepublicans in the last category; claimed that the canal frauds\r\noriginated under Democratic rule and were connived at by Democratic\r\nState officials; and proved that Republicans had administered the\r\ncanals and the State's finances more economically than the Democrats.\r\nHe also admitted reform to be the principal issue, thanked Tilden for\r\nthe little he had accomplished, severely castigated Bigelow for\r\naccepting place on the canal commission as a Republican and on the\r\nState ticket as a Democrat, and drew attention to Kelly as a bad man\r\nand to the extravagance of Democratic rule in New York City.\r\nThroughout it all his treatment was characteristically bold,\r\nbrilliant, and aggressive. \"The bright blade of his eloquence with its\r\nkeen satiric edge flashed defiantly before the eyes of the applauding\r\naudience,\"[1485] and every period exhibited his profound sense of the\r\nduty of maintaining the ascendency of a party which to him promised\r\nbest for the public.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1485: The _Nation_, October 28.]\r\n\r\nWith wisdom and sound argument Conkling had opposed inflation, and\r\nafter the passage of the bill on April 14, 1874, he had encouraged the\r\nPresident's veto. He had likewise advocated with no less fervour and\r\nsagacity the resumption of specie payment, which became a law on\r\nJanuary 14, 1875. This service justly entitled him to the highest\r\npraise. Nevertheless, in his speech at Albany he failed to show that\r\nRepublican success in 1875 would not mean a continuation of those\r\nthings which helped a Republican defeat in 1874. Hostility to a third\r\nterm and sympathy with a generous Southern policy were the conspicuous\r\nfeatures of the Saratoga platform, and upon these issues he maintained\r\na notable silence. His address was rather an appeal to the past--not\r\nan inspiring assurance for the future, seeking pure administration. Of\r\nhis personal honesty no one entertained a doubt, but for party ends he\r\nhad failed to use his opportunities in exposing and correcting abuses.\r\nTo him the country under Republican rule, whatever its shortcomings,\r\nwas in the safest hands, and he exhibited no sympathy with those\r\nwhose great love for their party made them long to have it stand for\r\ncivic righteousness, regardless of whom it might destroy.\r\n\r\nAs the campaign grew older Republicans cherished the hope of victory.\r\nThe break between Kelly and Morrissey had led to the formation of the\r\nIrving Hall Democracy. In this organisation all anti-Tammany elements\r\nfound a home, and to test its strength Morrissey declared himself a\r\ncandidate for the Senate in the fourth or old Tweed district, which\r\nusually recorded eleven thousand majority for Tammany. The Republicans\r\npromptly endorsed the nomination. This challenge had turned the whole\r\ncity into turmoil. Morrissey's audacity in selecting the invincible\r\nstronghold of Tammany for his field of battle, throwing the glamour of\r\na gloveless ring-contest over the struggle, brought into life all the\r\nconcomitants of such a bout. Kelly, leaving his uptown home,\r\npersonally led the Tammany forces, and on election day the paralytic,\r\nthe maimed, and men feeble from sickness were brought to the polls.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the votes were counted Morrissey proved the winner.\r\nIndeed, to the chagrin of Kelly and the alarm of the Democrats,\r\nTammany candidates had fallen in every part of the city, their\r\noverthrow encouraging the belief that the State had been carried by\r\nthe Republicans. Subsequently, when Bigelow's plurality of nearly\r\nfifteen thousand was established, it made defeat doubly\r\ndisheartening.[1486] It put Tilden on a pinnacle. It left Conkling on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1486: Bigelow, 390,211; Seward, 375,401. Robinson, 389,699;\r\nSpinner, 376,150.

The Union League Club, a body of earnest\r\nRepublicans and generous campaign givers, declared for pure government\r\nand a reforming Executive. Several county conventions voiced a protest\r\nagainst pledged delegations, and _Harper's Weekly_, in order to divide\r\nRepublicans more sharply into Conkling and anti-Conkling advocates,\r\nsuggested, in a series of aggressive editorials, that a reform\r\nDemocrat might be preferable to a Republican who represented the low\r\ntone of political honour and morality which exposed itself in official\r\nlife. On the assembling of the State convention (March 22) to select\r\ndelegates to Cincinnati, Curtis opened the way wider for a determined\r\nstruggle. \"The unceasing disposition of the officers and agents of the\r\nAdministration to prostitute the party organisations relentlessly and\r\nat all costs to personal ends,\" he said, \"has everywhere aroused the\r\napprehension of the friends of free government, and has startled and\r\nalarmed the honest masses of the Republican party.\"[1487] This shot\r\nfired across the bow of the organisation brought its head into the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1487: New York _Tribune_, March 23, 1876.]\r\n\r\nThe Conkling managers had secured a majority of the delegates, whose\r\ndesire to advertise an undivided sentiment for the Senator in New York\r\nmanifested itself by a willingness to yield in the interest of\r\nharmony. Finally, their resolution to instruct the delegation to vote\r\nas a unit took the more modest form of simply presenting \"Roscoe\r\nConkling as our choice for the nomination of President.\" Curtis,\r\nrefusing his assent, moved a substitute that left the selection of a\r\ncandidate to the patriotic wisdom of the National convention \"in full\r\nconfidence that it will present the name of some tried and true\r\nRepublican whose character and career are the pledge of a pure,\r\neconomical, and vigorous administration of the government.\" This was\r\nan issue--not a compromise. It practically put Conkling out of the\r\nrace, and after its presentation nothing remained to be done except to\r\ncall the roll. At its completion the startling discovery was made that\r\nof the 432 delegates present only 363 had answered, and that of these\r\n113 had boldly stood with Curtis. Equally impressive, too, was the\r\nsilence of the 69 who refrained from voting. Thus it appeared that,\r\nafter the whole office-holding power had worked for weeks to secure\r\ndelegates, only 33 more than a majority favoured even the presentation\r\nof Conkling's name. It was recalled by way of contrast that in 1860,\r\nSeward, without an office at his command, had led the united\r\nRepublican enthusiasm of the State.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of Seward's supporters at Chicago, the friends\r\nof Conkling at Cincinnati occupied an entire hotel, distributed with\r\nlavishness the handsome State badge of blue, entertained their\r\nvisitors with a great orchestra, paraded in light silk hats, and swung\r\nacross the street an immense banner predicting that \"Roscoe Conkling's\r\nnomination assures the thirty-five electoral votes of New York.\" These\r\nheadquarters were in marked contrast to the modest rooms of other\r\nStates having favourite sons. No Blaine flag appeared, and only an oil\r\nportrait of Hayes adorned the Ohio parlours. A Philadelphia delegate,\r\nafter surveying the Grand Hotel and the marchers, ironically remarked\r\nthat \"it was a mystery to him where the Custom-house got bail for all\r\nthose fellows.\"[1488]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1488: New York _Tribune_, June 15, 1876.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Edwin D. Morgan, who called the convention to order,\r\nevoked long-continued applause. It recalled two decades of stirring\r\nnational life since he had performed a like duty in 1856. Theodore M.\r\nPomeroy's selection as temporary chairman likewise honoured New York,\r\nand his address, although read from manuscript, added to his fame as\r\nan orator. In seconding the nomination of Bristow, George William\r\nCurtis, speaking \"for that vast body of Republicans in New York who\r\nhave seen that reform is possible within the Republican party,\" won\r\nhis way to the convention's heart as quickly as he did in 1860,\r\nalthough each person present avowed, after Robert G. Ingersoll had\r\nspoken, that for the first time he understood the possible compass of\r\nhuman eloquence.[1489]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1489: _Official Proceedings of National Republican\r\nConventions_, p. 292.]\r\n\r\nUntil the deciding ballot New York's part in the convention proved\r\nperfunctory. Beyond the sound of its music and the tread of its\r\nmarchers neither applause nor good will encouraged its candidate.\r\nReformers regarded Conkling as the antithesis of Bristow, supporters\r\nof Morton jealously scowled at his rivalry, and the friends of Blaine\r\nresented his attitude toward their favourite. Only Hayes's little band\r\nof expectant backers, hoping eventually to capture the New York\r\ndelegation, gracefully accorded him generous recognition.[1490]\r\nConkling's support, beginning with ninety-nine votes, gradually fell\r\noff to eighty-one, when the delegation, without formally withdrawing\r\nhis name, dropped him with not a word and divided between Blaine and\r\nHayes, giving the former nine votes and the latter sixty-one.[1491] In\r\nfact, Morton and Conkling, the two political legatees of Grant, fared\r\nabout alike, their strength in the North outside their respective\r\nStates aggregating only six votes. The President, believing a \"dark\r\nhorse\" inevitable, wrote a letter favouring Hamilton Fish.[1492]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1490: New York _Commercial Advertiser_, September 28, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1491: Conkling's votes came from the following States:\r\nCalifornia, 1; Florida, 3; Georgia, 8; Michigan, 1; Mississippi, 1;\r\nMissouri, 1; Nevada, 2; New York, 69; North Carolina, 7; Texas, 3;\r\nVirginia, 3. Total, 99. George William Curtis refused to vote for\r\nConkling.\r\n\r\nSeven ballots were taken, as follows:\r\n\r\nBlaine     285     296     293     286     308     351\r\nBristow    113     114     121     126     111      21\r\nMorton     124     120     113     108      85\r\nConkling    99      93      90      84      81\r\nHayes       61      64      67      68     113     384\r\nHartranft   58      63      68      71      50\r\nJewell      11\r\nWheeler      3       3       2       2       2       2\r\n\r\nOn the final ballot the following New York delegates voted for Blaine:\r\nWilliam H. Robertson, Westchester; James W. Husted, Westchester; Jacob\r\nWorth, Kings; John H. Ketcham, Dutchess; Jacob W. Haysradt, Columbia;\r\nJames M. Marvin, Saratoga; Stephen Sanford, Montgomery; Amos V.\r\nSmiley, Lewis, and James C. Feeter, Herkimer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1492: John Russell Young, _Around the World with General\r\nGrant_, Vol. 2, p. 275.]\r\n\r\nFor Vice-President the convention turned to New York. Stewart L.\r\nWoodford was the choice of the delegation. In presenting Conkling's\r\nname his oratorical power had won admiration, while delegates from\r\nOhio, Indiana, and other Western States, where his voice had been\r\nheard in opposition to Greenbackism, did not forget his unselfish\r\ndevotion, nor the brilliant rhetoric that clothed his unanswerable\r\narguments. But the Blaine States manifested genuine enthusiasm for\r\nWilliam A. Wheeler, a man of pure life, simple habits, ripe culture,\r\nand sincere and practical principles, who had won the esteem of all\r\nhis associates in Congress. To add to his charm he had a good presence\r\nand warm family affections. He possessed, too, a well-earned\r\nreputation for ability, having served with credit in the Legislature,\r\nin Congress, and as president of the constitutional convention of\r\n1866-7. Conkling thought him \"not very well known.\"[1493] Nevertheless,\r\nhe had been mentioned for President, and throughout the long and\r\nexciting contest two delegates from Massachusetts kept his name before\r\nthe convention. George F. Hoar, afterward the distinguished\r\nMassachusetts senator, became especially active in his behalf, and\r\nJames Russell Lowell called him \"a very sensible man.\"[1494] Outside\r\ndelegations, therefore, without waiting for New York to act, quickly\r\nexhibited their partiality by putting him in nomination.[1495] Later,\r\nwhen the Empire State named Stewart L. Woodford, the situation became\r\nembarrassing. Finally, as the Wheeler vote rapidly approached a\r\nmajority, the Empire delegation, to escape being run over again,\r\nreluctantly withdrew its candidate.[1496] The roll call, thus abruptly\r\ndiscontinued, showed Wheeler far ahead of the aggregate vote of all\r\ncompetitors, and on motion his nomination was made unanimous.[1497]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1493: New York _Herald_, June 17, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1494: Hoar, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 244.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1495: Wheeler's name was presented by Luke P. Poland of\r\nVermont, and seconded by S.H. Russell of Texas, and Henry R. James of\r\nNew York (Ogdensburg). Thomas C. Platt presented Woodford.\r\n\r\n\"Wheeler very much disliked Roscoe Conkling and all his ways. Conkling\r\nonce said to him: 'If you will join us and act with us, there is\r\nnothing in the gift of the State of New York to which you may not\r\nreasonably aspire.' To which Wheeler replied: 'Mr. Conkling, there is\r\nnothing in the gift of the State which will compensate me for the\r\nforfeiture of my own self-respect.'\"--Hoar, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1,\r\np. 243.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1496: \"It was not to the credit of the New York delegation\r\nthat Wheeler was obliged to look to other States for his presentation\r\nand support.\"--Utica _Herald_, June 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1497: With fifteen States and Territories to be called, the\r\nvote stood as follows: Wheeler, 366; all others, 245.]\r\n\r\nThe rank and file of the party, exhibiting no discouragement because\r\nof the outcome at Cincinnati, sought a strong candidate to head their\r\nState ticket.[1498] To those possessing the reform spirit William M.\r\nEvarts appealed as a representative leader. He had indicated no desire\r\nto hold public office. Indeed, it may be said that he always seemed\r\ndisinterested in political conditions so far as they affected him\r\npersonally. Although his friends thought the old supporters of Seward,\r\nif not Seward himself, had failed to sustain him for the United States\r\nSenate in 1861 as faithfully as he would have supported the Secretary\r\nof State under like conditions, there is no evidence that he ever\r\nfound fault. When in Hayes' Cabinet and afterwards in the Senate\r\n(1885-91), he did not take or attempt to take, either in the counsels\r\nof his party or of his colleagues, the leadership for which he was\r\nadmirably fitted. It is doubtful, in fact, if he ever realised the\r\nstrong hold he had upon the respect and admiration of the country. But\r\nthe people knew that his high personal character, his delightful\r\noratory, his unfailing wit and good-nature, and his great prestige as\r\na famous lawyer of almost unexampled success commended him as an ideal\r\ncandidate. Conspicuously among those urging his candidacy for governor\r\nin 1876 appeared a body of influential leaders from the Union League\r\nand Reform clubs of the metropolis, calling themselves Independents.\r\nThe Liberals, too, added voice to this sentiment.[1499]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1498: The Republican State convention met at Saratoga on\r\nAugust 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1499: Although many prominent Republicans who voted for\r\nGreeley in 1872 had previously renewed their allegiance, the Liberals\r\nas an organisation did not formally coalesce with the Republican party\r\nuntil August 23, 1876. On that day about 200 delegates, headed by John\r\nCochrane and Benjamin F. Manierre, met in convention at Saratoga, and\r\nafter accepting Hayes and Wheeler as the exponents of their reform\r\nprinciples, were invited amidst loud applause to seats in the\r\nRepublican State convention.]\r\n\r\nIf the candidate could not be Evarts, the same elements evidenced a\r\ndisposition to support Edwin D. Morgan, who had shown of late a\r\ndisturbing independence of the machine. Of the other aspirants William\r\nH. Robertson presented his usual strength in the Hudson River\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nAlonzo B. Cornell was the candidate of the organisation. Evarts had\r\nillustrated his independence in accepting office under President\r\nJohnson, in criticising the Grant administration, and in protesting\r\nagainst the Louisiana incident. Robertson, in voting for Blaine, had\r\nlikewise gone to the outer edge of disloyalty. Nor did Morgan's\r\nattitude at Cincinnati commend him. His ambition, which centred in the\r\nvice-presidency, left the impression that he had cared more for\r\nhimself than for Conkling. Under these circumstances the Senator\r\nnaturally turned to Cornell, an efficient lieutenant, who, having\r\nencountered heavy seas and a head wind, hoisted the signal of distress\r\nand waited for Conkling's coming. The Senator, however, did not\r\nappear. His rooms were engaged, his name was added to the hotel\r\nregister, and Cornell's expectant friends declared that he would again\r\ncapture the convention with his oratory; but Conkling, knowing that in\r\npolitical conventions the power of oratory depended largely upon\r\npledged delegations, prudently stayed away. Besides, he was not a\r\ndelegate, his partisans in Oneida having been put to rout. This forced\r\nthe withdrawal of Cornell, whose delegates, drifting to Morgan as the\r\nlesser of two evils, nominated him on the first ballot.[1500] Evarts\r\nwas too great a man to be lifted into national prominence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1500: Whole number of votes cast, 410. Necessary to a choice,\r\n206. Morgan received 242; Evarts, 126; Robertson, 24; Martin, 1;\r\nTownsend, 18.]\r\n\r\nFor lieutenant-governor, Sherman S. Rogers of Erie and Theodore M.\r\nPomeroy of Cayuga entered the lists. Encouraged by the folly of a few\r\nrash friends, Cornell also allowed his name to be presented, \"since he\r\nhad been grievously wronged,\" said his eulogist, \"in the dishonest\r\ncount of 1868.\"[1501] Cornell had adroitly extricated himself from\r\nhumiliating defeat in the morning by a timely withdrawal, but not\r\nuntil George William Curtis declared his nomination \"the most\r\ndangerous that could be made,\" and William B. Woodin of Cayuga had\r\nstigmatised him, did he fully appreciate his unpopularity as the\r\nrepresentative of machine methods. Woodin's attack upon Cornell\r\nundoubtedly weakened Pomeroy. It possessed the delectable acidity, so\r\nreckless in spirit, but so delightful in form, that always made the\r\ndistinguished State senator's remarks attractive and diverting.\r\nAlthough whatever weakened Pomeroy naturally strengthened Rogers, it\r\nadded greatly to the latter's influence that he represented the home\r\nof William Dorsheimer, whom the Democrats would renominate, and in the\r\nend the Buffalonian won by a handsome majority.[1502]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1501: New York _Tribune_, August 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1502: The ballot resulted: Rogers, 240; Pomeroy, 178.\r\nNecessary to a choice, 210.\r\n\r\nThe ticket was as follows: Governor, Edwin D. Morgan, New York;\r\nLieutenant-Governor, Sherman S. Rogers, Erie; Court of Appeals, George\r\nF. Danforth, Monroe; Canal Commissioner, Daniel C. Spencer,\r\nLivingston; Prison Inspector, Charles W. Trowbridge, Kings.]\r\n\r\nThe day's work, however, left bitter thoughts. Conkling's absence\r\nexaggerated Arthur's poor generalship and George H. Sharpe's failure\r\nto support Cornell. Sharpe was one of the organisation's cleverest\r\nleaders, and his indifference to Cornell's interests left a jagged\r\nwound that was not soon to heal. Moreover, it could not be concealed\r\nthat Morgan's nomination was a Pyrrhic victory. In fact, the\r\nconventions at Cincinnati and Saratoga had thrown the Conkling machine\r\nout of gear, and while the repair shop kept it running several years\r\nlonger, it was destined never again to make the speed it had formerly\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTILDEN ONE VOTE SHORT\r\n\r\n1876\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the election in 1875 the eyes of the national Democracy turned\r\ntoward Tilden as its inevitable candidate for President. He had not\r\nonly beaten a Canal ring, strengthened by remnants of the old Tweed\r\nring, but he had carried the State against the energies of a fairly\r\nunited Republican party. Moreover, he had become, in the opinion of\r\nhis friends, the embodiment of administrative reform, although he\r\nsuffered the embarrassment of a statesman who is suspected, rightly or\r\nwrongly, of a willingness to purchase reform at any price.[1503] To\r\nprove his right to be transferred from Albany to Washington he now\r\nmade his message to the Legislature a treatise upon national affairs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1503: Tilden's policy of pardoning members of the Tweed ring\r\nhad become intolerable. \"On an average about nine out of ten men who\r\nwere confessedly guilty of stealing were accepted as witnesses against\r\nthe other one man, until the time came when there was but one man\r\nagainst whom any testimony could be used, and it was not considered\r\nwise to try him. It was a shameful condition of affairs.\"--John D.\r\nTownsend, _New York in Bondage_, p. 141.]\r\n\r\nDwelling at length upon the financiering of the Federal Government,\r\nTilden sought to account for the financial depression, and in pointing\r\nto a remedy he advocated the prompt resumption of specie payment,\r\ncriticised the dread of imaginary evils, encouraged economy in\r\nlegislation, and analysed the federal system of taxation and\r\nexpenditure. Furthermore, he sought to cut loose from the discredited\r\npast of his party, and in paying high tribute to the patriotism of the\r\nSouth, he expressed the hope that its acceptance of the results of the\r\nwar might end forever the retribution visited upon it by the standing\r\nmenace of military force.[1504]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1504: Tilden's _Public Writings and Speeches_, Vol. 2, pp.\r\n237-295.]\r\n\r\nThe result at Cincinnati increased the necessity for nominating Tilden\r\nat St. Louis, since Wheeler's popularity would materially assist in\r\nreplacing New York among reliable Republican States. Nevertheless, the\r\npredatory class who had felt the weight of Tilden's heavy hand\r\nfomented a most formidable opposition at the State convention.[1505]\r\nJohn Kelly deeply sympathised with the movement. He resented the\r\nrivalry and independence of the Sage of Gramercy Park, and he did not\r\ndisguise his hostility. But Kelly's immediate need centred in the\r\nexclusion of the Morrissey delegation, and when the Tilden lieutenants\r\nproscribed it, the way was smoothed for the Governor's unanimous\r\nendorsement with the gag of unit rule.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1505: The Democratic State convention was held at Utica,\r\nApril 26, 1876.]\r\n\r\nThe admission of Kelly's delegates, however, did not close the mouths\r\nof Tilden's opponents.[1506]. Organs of the Canal ring continued to\r\nurge Seymour or Church for President, maintaining that the\r\nconvention's action did not bind the delegation. Church supported this\r\ninterpretation of the declaration.[1507] But it remained for the\r\n_Express_, the authorised organ of Tammany, to stigmatise Tilden. With\r\ncruel particularity it referred to his many-sided conduct as counsel\r\nand director in connection with the foreclosure and reorganisation of\r\ncertain railroads in Illinois, reciting details of the affair in a\r\nmanner highly prejudicial to his integrity as a lawyer and his\r\nreputation as a man of wealth. \"Of the weak points in Mr. Tilden's\r\nrailroad record,\" the editor suggestively added, \"we know more than we\r\ncare to publish.\"[1508] It doubled the severity of the blow because\r\nsuit had been instituted to compel Tilden to account for the proceeds\r\nof large amounts of bonds and stock, and instead of meeting the\r\nallegations promptly he had sought and obtained delay. This seemed to\r\ngive colour to the indictment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1506: \"It is natural enough that the canal ring and its\r\nfollowers, Tammany and its adherents, and that sort of Democrats who\r\nare commonly called Bourbons, should labour to defeat the nomination\r\nfor high office of the man who represents everything that they oppose,\r\nand opposes everything that they represent; but it will be a most\r\ndiscouraging thing to every person who hopes for good at the hands of\r\nthe Democratic party if such opposition is permitted to prevail in its\r\ncouncils. He has put his principles in practice in the most fearless\r\nand resolute manner, and has made himself especially obnoxious to his\r\nopponents as their hostility to him clearly shows.\"--New York _Evening\r\nPost_ (editorial by William Cullen Bryant), May 26, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1507: New York _Tribune_, June 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1508: New York _Evening Express_, June 23, 1876.]\r\n\r\nAt St. Louis Tilden's opponents, headed by John Kelly, Augustus\r\nSchell, and Erastus Corning, soon wore these insinuations\r\nthreadbare.[1509] To their further declaration that in order to succeed\r\nin November the Democracy must have one October State and that Tilden\r\ncould not carry Indiana, Dorsheimer and Bigelow, the Governor's\r\nspokesmen, replied that New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut could\r\nelect Tilden without Indiana. The colossal assurance of this answer\r\ncharacterised the convention's confidence in Tilden's strength. It\r\npossessed the South, the East, and the West. Hancock might be the\r\nfavourite in Pennsylvania, Parker in New Jersey, Bayard in Delaware,\r\nAllen in Ohio, and Hendricks in Indiana, but as delegates entered the\r\nconvention city the dense Tilden sentiment smothered them. Even\r\nscandal did not appreciably weaken it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1509: The National Democratic convention assembled on June 27\r\nand 28.]\r\n\r\nThere was nothing mysterious about this strength. Tilden represented\r\nsuccess. Without him disaster threatened--with him victory seemed\r\ncertain. His achievement in administrative reform exaggerated\r\nRepublican failure; his grasp upon New York, the most vital State of\r\nthe North, magnified Democratic strength; his leadership, based upon\r\nideas and organisation, dwarfed political rivals; his acute legal\r\nmind, leading to the largest rewards in the realm of law, captivated\r\nbusiness men; and his wealth, amassed in the field of railroad\r\norganisation and litigation, could fill Democracy's exchequer. Thus\r\nTilden, standing less on the Democratic platform than on his own\r\nrecord, held the commanding position in his party, and the talk of his\r\nunpopularity or how he obtained wealth seemed to make as little\r\nimpression as his professed devotion to the Wilmot Proviso in 1847, or\r\nhis departure for a season from a lifelong pro-slavery record to bear\r\na prominent part in the Barnburners' revolt of 1848. Indeed, so\r\ncertain was Tilden of success that he did not ask for advices until\r\nafter the nomination. James C. Carter of the New York bar, who\r\nhappened at the time to be with him respecting legal matters, wondered\r\nat his unconcern. On their return from an evening drive Carter\r\nventured to suggest that he would find telegrams announcing his\r\nnomination. \"Not until half-past nine,\" Tilden replied.[1510]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1510: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 1, p. 308.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the first call of States made the Tilden managers\r\nshiver.[1511] Alabama divided its vote, Colorado caused a murmur of\r\ndisappointment, and the slump of Georgia and Illinois, with Missouri's\r\ndivision, threatened them with heart-failure. The South wabbled, and\r\npromised votes in the North found their way elsewhere. At the close of\r\nthe first roll-call Missouri asked if its vote could be changed, and\r\non receiving an affirmative answer, the Tilden men, pale with worried\r\nexcitement, awaited the result. A change to Hancock at that moment\r\nwould have been a serious calamity, for nearly one hundred votes\r\nseparated Tilden from the necessary two-thirds. When Missouri declared\r\nfor the New Yorker, however, the opportunity to turn the tide against\r\nhim was lost forever. The second ballot undoubtedly represented his\r\nreal strength.[1512] For second place Thomas A. Hendricks had no\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1511: Francis Kernan presented Tilden's name very\r\neffectively.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1512: First ballot. Necessary two-thirds, 492. Samuel J.\r\nTilden of New York, 404-1/2; Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana, 133-1/2;\r\nWinfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, 75; William Allen of Ohio, 56;\r\nThomas F. Bayard of Delaware, 27; Joel Parker of New Jersey, 18.\r\n\r\nSecond ballot: Tilden, 535; Hendricks, 60; Hancock, 59; Allen, 54;\r\nBayard, 11; Parker, 18; Thurman of Ohio, 2.]\r\n\r\nThe platform, prepared under the eye of Tilden by Manton Marble, the\r\naccomplished editor of the _World_, advocated reform as its keynote\r\nand made historic its vituperative arraignment of the party in power.\r\nOn the vital question of the currency it demanded the repeal of the\r\nresumption clause of the Act of 1875, denouncing it as an hindrance to\r\nthe resumption of specie payment. The Republicans, wishing to avoid\r\ntoo sharp a conflict with the soft money sentiment of the West, had\r\npledged the fulfilment of the Public Credit Act,[1513] approved March\r\n18, 1869, \"by a continuous and steady progress to specie payments.\"\r\nBoth declarations savoured of indefiniteness, but Hayes, in his letter\r\nof acceptance (July 8), added greatly to his reputation for firmness\r\nand decision of character in supplying the needed directness by\r\ndemanding the resumption of specie payment. On the other hand,\r\nTilden's letter (July 31) weakened the country's respect for him.[1514]\r\nHe had no sympathy for soft money, but in supporting the demand for a\r\nrepeal of the resumption clause he urged, in a long, indefinite\r\ncommunication, the importance of preparation for resumption, ignoring\r\nthe fact that the Act of 1875 anticipated such precaution. Although\r\nless prolix in his treatment of civil service reform, he was no less\r\nindefinite. After describing recognised evils he failed to indicate\r\nany practical remedy beyond the \"conviction that no reform will be\r\ncomplete and permanent until the Chief Executive is constitutionally\r\ndisqualified for re-election.\"[1515] Speaking of the character of the\r\nmen holding office his use of the word \"usufruct\" led to the derisive\r\nappellation of \"Old Usufruct Tilden.\"[1516] On civil service reform\r\nHayes was more specific. He declared against the use of official\r\npatronage in elections and pledged himself not to be a candidate for a\r\nsecond term.[1517]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1513: This act terminates as follows: \"And the United States\r\nalso solemnly pledges its faith to make provision at the earliest\r\npracticable period for the redemption of the United States notes in\r\ncoin.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1514: \"Tilden's letter was a disappointment to those who had\r\nstudied his words and acts as Governor.\"--Rhodes, _History of the\r\nUnited States_, Vol. 7, p. 216.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1515: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1876, p. 790.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1516: \"The public interest in an honest, skilful performance\r\nof official trust must not be sacrificed to the usufruct of the\r\nincumbents.\"--Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1876, p. 790.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1517: _Ibid._, p. 783.]\r\n\r\nIf Conkling had been balked in his desire to nominate Cornell, Tilden\r\nwas not less baffled a week later in his effort to promote William\r\nDorsheimer, his special friend. His genius for organisation had\r\nsmoothed the way for harmony at Saratoga.[1518] Kelly and Morrissey\r\nsettled their differences in advance, the platform created no\r\ndiscussion, and the appointment of electors-at-large provoked little\r\ncriticism; but when Tilden's lieutenants proposed Dorsheimer for\r\ngovernor the convention revolted. It noisily demanded a Democrat, and\r\nin the stampede that followed Clarkson N. Potter, backed by Tammany\r\nand the Canal ring, rapidly accumulated strength despite Tilden's\r\npersonal opposition. To all of Tilden's friends vital objections\r\nseemed to be raised. Dorsheimer could not command a solid Democratic\r\nvote; Robinson favoured high canal tolls and cultivated Republican\r\naffiliations; Manton Marble remained unpopular because the _World_\r\nchanged front in 1868; and Starbuck of Jefferson did not attract\r\nIndependents. For once Tilden had plainly been deceived as to his\r\nstrength. Furthermore, the convention, divided in its attention\r\nbetween speeches for Potter and demands for Seymour, was beyond his\r\ncontrol. Nevertheless, as the delegates in their stentorian insistence\r\nupon a \"Democrat\" became more and more furious for Seymour, the Tilden\r\nmanagers, to head off the alarming sentiment for Potter, adroitly\r\nincreased the volume of the demand for the Oneidan. It was known that\r\nSeymour had refused the use of his name. Telegrams to Kernan and\r\nletters to the president of the convention alleged indisposition and\r\n\"obstacles which I cannot overcome.\"[1519] But the convention,\r\nconscious that the former governor had before changed his mind under\r\nsimilar circumstances, closed its ears to his entreaties, and amidst\r\nthe most vociferous cheering nominated him by acclamation. The next\r\nmorning, with equal unanimity, it renominated Dorsheimer for\r\nlieutenant-governor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1518: The Democratic State convention convened on August 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1519: Utica _Herald_, August 31, 1876.]\r\n\r\nA few days later Seymour, pleading mental inability to perform the\r\nduties of the office, put himself out of the race.[1520] This gave\r\nTilden opportunity to re-form his lines, and upon the convention's\r\nreassembling (September 13) Robinson easily won.[1521]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1520: For Seymour's letter, see New York papers of September\r\n5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1521: The ballot stood: Potter, 106-1/2; Robinson, 192-1/2;\r\nscattering, 59. Necessary to a choice, 191. Before its announcement\r\nchanges gave Robinson 243-1/2.\r\n\r\nThe ticket was as follows: Governor, Lucius Robinson, Chemung;\r\nLieutenant-Governor, William Dorsheimer, Erie; Court of Appeals,\r\nRobert Earl, Herkimer; Canal Commissioner, Darius A. Ogden, Yates;\r\nPrison Inspector, Robert H. Anderson, Kings.]\r\n\r\nDemocratic factions likewise buried their differences in New York\r\nCity, Kelly and Morrissey uniting upon Smith Ely for mayor. The\r\nRepublicans nominated John A. Dix. Thus was the municipal struggle in\r\nthe metropolis, for the first time in many years, confined within\r\nstrict party lines.[1522]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1522: On March 15, several disaffected Democrats met at\r\nSyracuse and organised a Greenback party, which opposed the resumption\r\nof specie payment and favoured legal tender notes as the standard of\r\nvalue. A second convention, held in New York City on June 1, selected\r\nfour delegates-at-large to the Democratic national convention, and a\r\nthird, meeting at Albany on September 26, nominated Richard M. Griffin\r\nfor governor. Other State nominations were made by the Prohibitionists,\r\nAlbert J. Groo being selected for governor.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign, although a prolonged and intensely exciting one,\r\ndeveloped no striking incidents. Democratic orators repeated Marble's\r\nrhetorical arraignment of the Republican party, and the Democratic\r\npress iterated and reiterated its symmetrical, burning sentences.\r\nMarble's platform, besides being the most vitriolic, had the\r\ndistinction of being the longest in the history of national\r\nconventions. Copies of it printed in half a dozen languages seemed to\r\nspring up as plentifully as weeds in a wheatfield. Every cross-roads\r\nin the State became a centre for its distribution. It pilloried\r\nGrant's administration, giving in chronological order a list of his\r\nunwise acts, the names and sins of his unfaithful appointees, and a\r\nseries of reasons why Tilden, the Reformer, could alone restore the\r\nRepublic to its pristine purity. It was a dangerous document because\r\nhistory substantially affirmed its statement of facts, while the\r\nrhythm of its periods and the attractiveness of its typography invited\r\nthe reader.[1523]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1523: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1876, pp. 785, 786.]\r\n\r\nConkling, because of ill-health, limited his activity in the canvass\r\nto one address.[1524] It was calmer than usual, but it shone with\r\nsparkles of sarcasm and bristled with covert allusions readily\r\nunderstood. It was noticeable, too, that he made no reference to Hayes\r\nor to Wheeler. Nevertheless, party associates from whom he had\r\nradically differed pronounced it a model of partisan oratory and the\r\nmost conclusive review of the political situation. He admitted the\r\ncorruption indicated by Marble, attributing it chiefly to the war\r\nwhich incited speculative passion in all the activities of life, its\r\nill consequences not being confined exclusively to public affairs. In\r\ncontrasting the management of the two parties, he disclosed under\r\nBuchanan a loss on each thousand dollars collected and disbursed of\r\nsix dollars and ninety-eight cents against forty cents during Grant's\r\nfirst term and twenty-six cents during the three years of his second,\r\nwhile current expenses under Buchanan amounted to one dollar and\r\nninety cents per capita to one dollar and seventy cents under Grant.\r\nIn ten years, he added, $800,000,000 of the debt had been paid,\r\nnearly $50,000,000 of interest saved yearly, and the taxes reduced\r\n$262,000,000 per annum.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1524: Delivered at Utica, October 3. See New York papers,\r\nOctober 4.]\r\n\r\nOf civil service reform Conkling said nothing. He made a clear, sharp\r\nissue on the resumption of specie payment, however, showing that the\r\ndemand for a repeal of the Act's most important feature was a bid for\r\nthe votes of soft-money advocates. The Southern question assumed even\r\ngreater importance. Tilden depended for success upon the Southern\r\nStates plus New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. This was\r\nDorsheimer's argument, put with characteristic grace and force at St.\r\nLouis. The North had cause to fear, it was argued, if a solid South,\r\nstrengthened by States controlled by the great majorities in and about\r\nNew York City, could elect a President. The charge that Tilden\r\nintended indemnifying the South and assuming the Confederate debt\r\nincreased the anxiety. Conkling's reference to the repayment of direct\r\ntaxes, the refund of the cotton tax, and the liquidation of Southern\r\nclaims mounted so high into the hundreds of millions that Tilden\r\ndeemed it prudent to issue a letter pledging an enforcement of the\r\nConstitutional Amendments and resistance to such monetary demands.\r\n\r\nPersonal criticism of Tilden exploited his war record, his reputation\r\nas a railroad wrecker, and his evasion of the income tax.[1525] The\r\naccusation of \"railroad wrecking\" was scarcely sustained, but his\r\nincome tax was destined to bring him trouble. Nast kept his pencil\r\nbusy. One cartoon, displaying Tilden emptying a large barrel of\r\ngreenbacks into the ballot box, summed up the issues as follows: \"The\r\nshot-gun policy South, the barrel policy North;\" \"The solid South and\r\nthe solid Tammany;\" \"Tilden's war record--defeating the tax\r\ncollector.\" George William Curtis asserted that the Democrats of South\r\nCarolina meant to carry the State for Tilden by means of \"the shot\r\ngun,\" declaring that \"Jefferson Davis and the secessionists merely\r\nendeavoured to enforce with bayonets the doctrines of Mr.\r\nTilden.\"[1526]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1525: It was claimed that in 1862 Tilden had a net income of\r\n$89,000. He made oath to $7,118, and afterward acknowledged receiving\r\n$20,000 in the Terre Haute Railroad case. He alleged that this covered\r\nthe work of several years. Moreover, that his income-producing\r\nproperty was largely in railroad stocks, bonds, and other securities\r\non which the tax was deducted by the companies before the interest and\r\ndividends were paid.--Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 2, p. 232; see\r\nalso, _Nation_, September 22, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1526: _Harper's Weekly_, 1876, pp. 828, 885, 906, 907.]\r\n\r\nTilden displayed a stoical indifference to these personal attacks. He\r\nmade no speeches, he rarely exhibited himself to the public, and he\r\nkept his own counsels. His adroit, mysterious movements recalled the\r\nmethods but not the conceit of Aaron Burr. Although Abram S. Hewitt,\r\nchairman of the Democratic National Committee, managed the campaign\r\nwith skill, Tilden relied largely upon his own shrewdness, displacing\r\nold leaders for new ones, and making it clear to the country that he\r\nranked with Martin Van Buren as a great political manager. As he swept\r\nonward like a conquering Marlborough, inspiring his party with\r\nconfidence and his opponents with fear, events favoured his designs.\r\nThe Belknap exposures, the Whiskey ring suits, the Babcock trial,\r\nalarming and disgusting the country, inclined public opinion toward a\r\nchange which was expressed in the word \"reform.\" A combination of\r\npropitious circumstances within the State, in nowise indebted to his\r\nsagacity or assistance, also increased his strength. The collapse of\r\nthe Tweed and Canal rings justly gave him great prestige, but no\r\nreason existed why the extinguishment of the State war debt and the\r\nlimitations of canal expenditures to canal revenues should add to his\r\nlaurels, for the canal amendment to the Constitution was passed and\r\nthe payment of the war debt practically accomplished before he took\r\noffice. Nevertheless, the resulting decrease of the State budget by\r\nnearly one-half, being coincident with his term of office, added\r\nprodigiously to his fame.[1527] Indeed, he seemed to be the darling of\r\nFortune, and on November 7, exactly according to his calculation, he\r\ncarried New York,[1528] New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. But\r\nRepublicans claimed South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1527: \"The amount of the State tax for 1876 was\r\n$8,529,174.32, against $14,206,680.61 in 1875, and $15,727,482.08 in\r\n1874.\" Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1876, p. 598.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1528: Tilden, plurality, 32,742; Robinson, 30,460.

Spaulding of Buffalo, and Levi P. Morton of New\r\nYork, were defeated for Congress.]\r\n\r\nIn the historic dispute which led to a division of the solid South,\r\npartisan papers revelled in threats, and rumours indicated danger of\r\nmob violence. To prevent fraud prominent citizens in the North,\r\nappointed to represent each political party, watched the canvassing\r\nboards in the three disputed States, and although it subsequently\r\ndeveloped that distinguished New Yorkers resorted to bribery,[1529] the\r\nlegal canvassing boards finally certified the electoral votes to Hayes\r\nand Wheeler. On December 6 the official count in all the States gave\r\nHayes 185 votes and Tilden 184. The Democrats, deeply disturbed by the\r\naction of the Returning Boards, now displayed a temper that resembled\r\nthe spirit preceding the civil war. Threats were openly made that\r\nHayes should never be inaugurated. The Louisville _Courier Journal_\r\nannounced that \"if they (our people) will rise in their might, and\r\nwill send 100,000 petitioners to Washington to present their memorial\r\nin person, there will be no usurpation and no civil war.\"[1530] A\r\nprominent ex-Confederate in Congress talked of 145,000 well\r\ndisciplined Southern troops who were ready to fight.[1531] Because the\r\nPresident prudently strengthened the military forces about Washington\r\nhe was charged with the design of installing Hayes with the aid of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1529: Manton Marble visited Florida. On November 22, under\r\nthe _sobriquet_ \"Moses,\" he telegraphed in cipher to William T.\r\nPelton, Tilden's nephew, then domiciled in Tilden's home at 15\r\nGramercy Park: \"Have just received proposition to hand over a Tilden\r\ndecision of Board and certificate of Governor for $200,000.\" Pelton\r\nthought it too much, and Marble again telegraphed that one Elector\r\ncould be secured for $50,000. Pelton replied that he \"could not draw\r\nuntil the vote of the Elector was received.\" On December 5, Marble\r\nwired: \"Proposition failed.... Tell Tilden to saddle Blackstone.\"\r\n\r\nSmith M. Weed visited South Carolina. On November 16, without the use\r\nof cipher or _sobriquet_, he telegraphed Henry Havermeyer: \"Board\r\ndemand $75,000 for two or three electors.\" Later in the day he added:\r\n\"Looks now as though $75,000 would secure all seven votes.\" The next\r\nday he wired: \"Press everywhere. No certainty here. Simply a hope.\" On\r\nNovember 18, he announced: \"Majority of Board secured. Cost $80,000.\r\nSend one parcel of $65,000; one of $10,000; one of $5,000. All to be\r\nin $1000 or $500 bills. Have cash ready to reach Baltimore Sunday\r\nnight.\" Pelton met Weed at Baltimore without the money and both went\r\nto New York to secure it. Meantime, the canvassing board reported in\r\nfavour of Hayes.\r\n\r\nPelton also corresponded with one J.N.H. Patrick, who telegraphed from\r\nOregon: \"Must purchase Republican elector to recognise and act with\r\nthe Democrat, and secure vote to prevent trouble. Deposit $10,000 to\r\nmy credit.\" Pelton replied: \"If you will make obligation contingent on\r\nresult in March it will be done.\" Patrick said fee could not be made\r\ncontingent, whereupon $8,000 was deposited on January 1, 1877, to his\r\ncredit, but too late to complete the transaction.\r\n\r\nWhen these telegrams, translated by the New York _Tribune_, were\r\ninvestigated by the Potter Congressional committee in January, 1879,\r\nMarble testified that he transmitted them simply \"as danger signals\";\r\nWeed admitted and attempted to justify; Pelton accepted the full\r\nresponsibility, intending, he said, to get the money of Edward Cooper;\r\nCooper testified that the telegram requesting $80,000 sent to\r\nBaltimore was his first knowledge of Pelton's activity; that he\r\nimmediately informed Tilden, who recalled his nephew and put a stop to\r\nnegotiations. Tilden swore that \"no offer, no negotiation in behalf of\r\nany member of any Returning Board was ever entertained by me, or by my\r\nauthority, or with my sanction.... There never was a moment in which I\r\never entertained any idea of seeking to obtain those certificates by\r\nany venal inducement, any promise of money or office, to the men who\r\nhad them to grant or dispose of. My purpose on that subject was\r\nperfectly distinct, invariable, and it was generally assumed by all my\r\nfriends without discussion. It may have sometimes been expressed and\r\nwhenever the slightest occasion arose for it to be discussed, it was\r\nexpressed. It was never deviated from in word or act.\"--Testimony in\r\nrelation to Cipher Telegraphic Dispatches, pp. 200-274; see also,\r\nBigelow's _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 2, pp. 180-223.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1530: From an editorial signed by Henry Watterson, January 8,\r\n1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1531: Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. 7, p.\r\n243.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Republicans believed Tilden endeavoured to buy the\r\npresidency. Although nothing was then known of Marble's and Weed's\r\nefforts to tamper with the canvassing boards of South Carolina and\r\nFlorida, the disposition to \"steal\" a vote in Oregon, which clearly\r\nbelonged to Hayes, deprived Tilden's cause of its moral weight.\r\nIndeed, so strongly did sentiment run against him that the _Nation_\r\n\"lost nearly three thousand subscribers for refusing to believe that\r\nMr. Hayes could honourably accept the presidency.\"[1532]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1532: The _Nation_, June 25, 1885.]\r\n\r\nWhen Congress opened the Democrats, being in control of the House,\r\ndesired to continue the joint rule of February, 1865, directing that\r\n\"no electoral vote objected to shall be counted except by the\r\nconcurrent votes of the two Houses.\" This would elect Tilden. On the\r\nother hand, the Republicans, holding that the joint rule expired with\r\nthe Congress adopting it, insisted that, inasmuch as the canvass by\r\nCongress at all previous elections had been confined exclusively to\r\nopening the certificates of each State, sent to Washington under the\r\nofficial seal of the respective governors, the Vice-President should\r\nopen and count the electoral votes and declare the result, the members\r\nof the two Houses acting simply as witnesses. This would elect Hayes.\r\nTo many and especially to President Grant this controversy seemed full\r\nof danger, to avert which if possible Congress adopted a resolution\r\nproviding for a committee of fourteen, equally divided between the\r\nSenate and House, \"to report without delay such a measure as may in\r\ntheir judgment be best calculated to accomplish the desired\r\nend.\"[1533] On January 18 (1877) this committee reported a bill\r\nproviding that where two or more returns had been received from a\r\nState such returns should be referred to an Electoral Commission\r\ncomposed of five senators, five members of the House, and five\r\njustices of the Supreme Court, who should decide any question\r\nsubmitted to it touching the return from any State, and that such\r\ndecision should stand unless rejected by the concurrent votes of the\r\ntwo Houses. By tacit agreement the Senate was to name three\r\nRepublicans and two Democrats, and the House three Democrats and two\r\nRepublicans, while the Bill itself appointed Justices Clifford,\r\nMiller, Field, and Strong, a majority of whom were authorised to\r\nselect a fifth justice.[1534]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1533: Upon this committee Conkling was substituted in place\r\nof Logan, detained at home. Abram S. Hewitt was one of the House\r\nappointees.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1534: Clifford and Field were accounted Democrats, and Miller\r\nand Strong, Republicans.]\r\n\r\nWhen doubt as to the three Southern States precipitated itself into\r\nthe result of the election, Tilden exhibited characteristic diligence\r\nand secrecy. He avoided public statements, but he scrutinised the\r\nreturns with the acumen exhibited in securing the Tweed evidence, and\r\nleft no flaw unchallenged in the title of his opponent. After the\r\naction of the canvassing boards he contended that the joint rule of\r\n1865 must govern, and in the study of the subject he devoted more than\r\na month to the preparation of a complete history of electoral counts,\r\nshowing it to have been the unbroken usage for Congress and not the\r\nPresident of the Senate to count the vote.[1535] Moreover, early in the\r\nsession of Congress he prepared two resolutions which raised the\r\nissue, and urged his friends in the leadership of the House to take no\r\nfurther step until the great constitutional battle had been fought\r\nalong that line, assuring them of his readiness to accept all the\r\nresponsibility of the outcome. To appraise the country of the\r\nstrength of this position he also prepared an extended brief which\r\nGovernor Robinson incorporated as a part of his inaugural message on\r\nJanuary 1, 1877.[1536]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1535: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 2, p. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1536: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, pp. 67-74.]\r\n\r\nTilden first learned of the proposed Electoral Commission Bill on\r\nJanuary 14. Abram S. Hewitt brought the information, saying that\r\nBayard and Thurman of the Senate, being absolutely committed to it,\r\nwould concur in reporting it whatever Tilden's action.[1537] Tilden,\r\nresenting the secrecy of its preparation as unwise and essentially\r\nundemocratic, declined to give it his approval.[1538] In his later\r\ntelegrams to Hewitt he expressed the belief that \"We should stand on\r\nthe Constitution and the settled practice;\" that \"the other side,\r\nhaving no way but by usurpation, will have greater troubles than we,\r\nunless relieved by some agreement;\" that \"the only way of getting\r\naccessions in the Senate is by the House standing firm;\" that \"we are\r\nover-pressed by exaggerated fears;\" and that \"no information is here\r\nwhich could justify an abandonment of the Constitution and practice of\r\nthe government, and of the rights of the two Houses and of the\r\npeople.\" To his friends who urged that time pressed, he exclaimed:\r\n\"There is time enough. It is a month before the count.\"\r\nRepresentations of the danger of a collision with the Executive met\r\nhis scorn. \"It is a panic of pacificators,\" he said. \"Why surrender\r\nbefore the battle for fear of having to surrender after the\r\nbattle?\"[1539]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1537: Manton Marble to the New York _Sun_, August 5, 1878.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1538: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 2, p. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1539: _Ibid._, pp. 76, 79, 80.]\r\n\r\nIn view of his resentment of the secrecy which characterised the\r\npreparation of the Electoral Commission Bill, one wonders that Tilden\r\nmade no appeal directly to the people, demanding that his party stand\r\nfirm to \"the settled practice\" and allow Republicans peaceably to\r\ninaugurate Hayes \"by usurpation\" rather than \"relieve them by some\r\nagreement.\" His telegrams to congressmen could not be published, and\r\nfew if any one knew him as the author of the discussion in Robinson's\r\ninaugural. The _Times_ thought \"the old Governor's hand is to be seen\r\nin the new Governor's message,\"[1540] but the _Nation_ expressed doubt\r\nabout it.[1541] A ringing proclamation over his own signature, however,\r\nwould have been known before sunset to every Democratic voter in the\r\nland. Blaine told Bigelow a year or two later that if the Democrats\r\nhad been firm, the Republicans would have backed down.[1542] Tilden's\r\nsilence certainly dampened his party's enthusiasm. It recalled, too,\r\nhis failure to assail the Tweed ring until the _Times'_ disclosure\r\nmade its destruction inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1540: New York _Times_, January 2, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1541: January 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1542: Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 2, p. 74, note.]\r\n\r\nBigelow, reflecting Tilden's thought, charged that in accepting the\r\nplan of an Electoral Commission Thurman and Bayard were influenced by\r\npresidential ambition, and that prominent congressmen could not regard\r\nwith satisfaction the triumph of a candidate who had been in nowise\r\nindebted to them for his nomination or success at the polls.[1543] On\r\nthe other hand, Blaine says the Democrats favoured the Commission\r\nbecause Davis, who affiliated with the Democratic party and had\r\npreferred Tilden to Hayes, was to be chosen for the fifth justice. The\r\nMaine statesman adds, without giving his authority, that Hewitt\r\nadvanced this as one of the arguments to induce Tilden to approve the\r\nbill.[1544] In his history of the Hewitt-Tilden interview Marble makes\r\nno mention of Davis' selection, nor does Bigelow refer to Tilden's\r\nknowledge of it. Nevertheless, the strength disclosed for the bill\r\nsustains Blaine's suggestion, since every Democrat of national\r\nreputation in both Houses supported it. The measure passed the Senate\r\non January 24 and the House on the 26th,[1545] but an unlooked-for\r\nevent quickly destroyed Democratic calculations and expectations, for\r\non January 25, too late for the party to recede with dignity or with\r\nhonour, the Democrats of the Illinois Legislature elected Davis by two\r\nmajority to the United States Senate in place of John A. Logan.\r\nProbably a greater surprise never occurred in American political\r\nhistory. It gave Davis an opportunity, on the ground of obvious\r\nimpropriety, to avoid what he neither sought nor desired, and narrowed\r\nthe choice of a fifth justice to out-and-out Republicans, thus\r\nsettling the election of Hayes. \"The drop in the countenance of Abram\r\nS. Hewitt,\" said a writer who informed Tilden's representative of\r\nDavis' transfer from the Supreme Court to the Senate, \"made it plain\r\nthat he appreciated its full significance.\"[1546] Bigelow could not\r\nunderstand why Davis did not serve on the Commission unless his\r\n\"declination was one of the conditions of his election,\" adding that\r\n\"it was supposed by many that Morton and others engineered the\r\nagreement of Davis' appointment with full knowledge that he would not\r\nserve.\"[1547] This cynical comment betrayed Tilden's knowledge of\r\n\"things hoped for,\" and accounts for his final acquiescence in the\r\nCommission, since Davis and a certainty were far better than a fight\r\nand possible failure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1543: _Ibid._, p. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1544: Blaine, _Twenty Tears of Congress_, Vol. 2, p. 584.\r\nMorrison of Illinois declared that Davis' \"most intimate friends,\r\namong whom I may count myself, don't know to-day whether he favored\r\nTilden or Hayes. He didn't vote at all.\"--_Century Magazine_, October,\r\n1901, p. 928.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1545: Senate: For, 26 Democrats, 21 Republicans; against, 16\r\nRepublicans, 1 Democrat.

Of all the members\r\nof the famous committee the Senator had borne the most useful part in\r\nframing the measure, and his appointment to the Commission was\r\nnaturally expected to follow.[1548] His biographer states that he\r\ndeclined to serve.[1549] \"If this be correct,\" says Rhodes, \"he shirked\r\na grave duty.\"[1550] Bigelow charges the omission to the Senator's\r\nbelief \"that the vote of Louisiana rightfully belonged to Mr. Tilden,\"\r\nand volunteers the information \"that Conkling had agreed to address\r\nthe Commission in opposition to its counting Louisiana for\r\nHayes.\"[1551] Conkling's absence from the Senate when the Louisiana\r\nvote was taken corroborates Bigelow,[1552] and supports the general\r\nopinion which obtained at the time, that the Republicans, suspecting\r\nConkling of believing Tilden entitled to the presidency, intentionally\r\nignored him in the make-up of the Commission.[1553] The reason for\r\nConkling's failure subsequently to address the Commission in\r\nopposition to counting Louisiana for Hayes nowhere explicitly appears.\r\n\"Various explanations are in circulation,\" writes Bigelow, \"but I have\r\nnot been able to determine which of them all had the demerit of\r\nsecuring his silence.\"[1554]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1548: \"General Grant sent for Senator Conkling, and said with\r\ndeep earnestness: 'This matter is a serious one, and the people feel\r\nit very deeply. I think this Electoral Commission ought to be\r\nappointed.' Conkling answered: 'Mr. President, Senator Morton' (who\r\nwas then the acknowledged leader of the Senate), 'is opposed to it and\r\nopposed to your efforts; but if you wish the Commission carried, I can\r\nhelp do it.' Grant said: 'I wish it done.'\"--George W.

The canvassing boards which returned the Hayes\r\nelectors also declared the election of Packard as governor, and it\r\nwould impeach his own title, it was said, if the President refused\r\nrecognition to Packard, who had received the larger popular majority.\r\n\r\nIt was not unknown that the President contemplated adopting a new\r\nSouthern policy. His letter of acceptance presupposed it, and before\r\nthe completion of the Electoral Commission's work political and\r\npersonal friends had given assurance in a published letter that Hayes\r\nwould not continue military intervention in the South.[1555] Moreover,\r\nthe President's inaugural address plainly indicated such a purpose. To\r\ninform himself of the extent to which the troops intervened,\r\ntherefore, and to harmonise if possible the opposing governments, he\r\nsent a commission to New Orleans,[1556] who reported (April 21) a\r\nreturning board quorum in both branches of the Nicholls Legislature\r\nand recommended the withdrawal of the army from the immediate vicinity\r\nof the State House. This was done on April 24 and thenceforward the\r\nNicholls government controlled in State affairs.[1557]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1555: Letter of Stanley Matthews and Charles Foster, dated\r\nFebruary 17, 1877.--Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1877, p. 459.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1556: This commission consisted of Charles B. Lawrence,\r\nJoseph B. Hawley, John M. Harlan, John C. Brown, and Wayne\r\nMcVeigh.--_Ibid._, p. 465.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1557: _Ibid._, pp. 456-465. Packard became consul to\r\nLiverpool.]\r\n\r\nThe President's policy quickly created discontent within the ranks of\r\nthe Republican party. Many violently resented his action, declaring\r\nhis refusal to sustain a governor whose election rested substantially\r\nupon the same foundation as his own as a cowardly surrender to the\r\nSouth in fulfillment of a bargain between his friends and some\r\nSouthern leaders.[1558] Others disclaimed the President's obligation to\r\ncontinue the military, declaring that it fostered hate, drew the\r\ncolour line more deeply, promoted monstrous local misgovernment, and\r\nprotected venal adventurers whose system practically amounted to\r\nhighway robbery. Furthermore, it did not keep the States under\r\nRepublican control, while it identified the Republican name with\r\nvindictive as well as venal power, as illustrated by the Louisiana\r\nDurrell affair in 1872,[1559] in the elections of 1874, and at the\r\norganisation of the Louisiana Legislature early in 1875.[1560]\r\nNotwithstanding these potent reasons for the President's action the\r\njudgment of a majority of his party deemed it an unwise and\r\nunwarranted act, although Grant spoke approvingly of it.[1561]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1558: The commission reported the Packard government's\r\ninsistence that the Legislature of 1870 had the power to create a\r\nReturning Board with all the authority with which the Act clothed it,\r\nand that the Supreme Court of the State had affirmed its\r\nconstitutionality. On the other hand, the Nichols government admitted\r\nthe Legislature's right to confide to a Returning Board the\r\nappointment of electors for President and Vice-President, but denied\r\nits power to modify the constitutional provision for counting the vote\r\nfor governor without first amending the State Constitution,\r\ndeclaring the Supreme Court's decision to the contrary not to be\r\nauthoritative.--Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1877, pp. 403-404.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1559: Durrell, a United States Circuit judge, sustained\r\nKellogg in his contest with McEnery.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1560: \"The President directs me to say that he does not\r\nbelieve public opinion will longer support the maintenance of the\r\nState government in Louisiana by the use of the military, and he must\r\nconcur in this manifest feeling.\" Grant's telegram to Packard, dated\r\nMar. 1, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1561: New York _Tribune_, July 10, 1877.]\r\n\r\nSimilar judgment was pronounced upon the President's attempt to\r\nreform the civil service by directing competitive examinations for\r\ncertain positions and by forbidding office-holders actively to\r\nparticipate in political campaigns.[1562] \"No officer should be\r\nrequired or permitted to take part in the management of political\r\norganisations, caucuses, conventions, or election campaigns,\" he wrote\r\nto the Secretary of the Treasury. \"Their right to vote and to express\r\ntheir views on public questions, either orally or through the press,\r\nis not denied, provided it does not interfere with the discharge of\r\ntheir official duties. No assessments for political purposes should be\r\nallowed.\" In a public order dated June 22 he made this rule applicable\r\nto all departments of the civil service. \"It should be understood by\r\nevery officer of the government that he is expected to conform his\r\nconduct to its requirements.\"[1563] To show his sincerity the\r\nPresident also appointed a new Civil Service Commission, with Dorman\r\nB. Eaton at its head, who adopted the rules formulated under Curtis\r\nduring the Grant administration, and which were applied with a measure\r\nof thoroughness, especially in the Interior Department under Carl\r\nSchurz, and in the New York post-office, then in charge of Thomas L.\r\nJames.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1562: The first step towards a change in the manner of\r\nappointments and removals was a bill introduced in Congress on\r\nDecember 20, 1865, by Thomas A. Jenckes of Rhode Island \"to regulate\r\nthe civil service of the United States.\" A few months later Senator B.\r\nGratz Brown of Missouri submitted a resolution for \"such change in the\r\ncivil service as shall secure appointments to the same after previous\r\nexaminations by proper Boards, and as shall provide for promotions on\r\nthe score of merit or seniority.\" On March 3, 1871, Congress appended\r\na section to an appropriation bill, authorising the President to\r\n\"prescribe such regulations for the admission of persons into the\r\ncivil service as may best promote efficiency therein and ascertain the\r\nfitness of each candidate in respect to age, health, character,\r\nknowledge and ability for the branch of service in which he seeks to\r\nenter; and for this purpose he may employ suitable persons to conduct\r\nsuch inquiries, prescribe their duties, and establish regulations for\r\nthe conduct of persons who may receive appointments.\" Under this\r\nauthority President Grant organised a commission composed of George\r\nWilliam Curtis, Joseph Medill, Alexander C. Cattell, Davidson A.\r\nWalker, E.B. Ellicott, Joseph H. Blackfan, and David C. Cox. This\r\ncommission soon found that Congress was indisposed to clothe them with\r\nthe requisite power, and although in the three years from 1872 to\r\n1875, they had established the entire soundness of the reform, an\r\nappropriation to continue the work was refused and the labours of the\r\ncommission came to an end.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1563: New York _Tribune_, June 25, 1877.]\r\n\r\nThis firm and aggressive stand against the so-called spoils system\r\nvery naturally aroused the fears of many veteran Republicans of\r\nsincere and unselfish motives, who had used offices to build up and\r\nmaintain party organisation, while the order restricting freedom of\r\npolitical action provoked bitter antagonism, especially among members\r\nof the New York Republican State Committee, several of whom held\r\nimportant Federal positions. To add to the resentment an official\r\ninvestigation of the New York custom-house was ordered, which\r\ndisclosed \"irregularities,\" said the report, \"that indicate the peril\r\nto which government and merchants are exposed by a system of\r\nappointments in which political influence dispenses with fitness for\r\nthe work.\"[1564] The President concurred. \"Party leaders should have no\r\nmore influence in appointments than other equally respectable\r\ncitizens,\" he said. \"It is my wish that the collection of the revenue\r\nshould be organised on a strictly business basis, with the same\r\nguarantees for efficiency and fidelity in the selection of the chief\r\nand subordinate officers that would be required by a prudent\r\nmerchant.\"[1565]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1564: New York _Tribune_, July 28, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1565: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThe Republican press, in large part, deplored the President's action,\r\nand while managing politicians smothered their real grievance under\r\nattacks upon the Southern policy, they generally assumed an attitude\r\nof armed neutrality and observation.[1566] No doubt the President was\r\nmuch to blame for this discontent. He tolerated the abuses disclosed\r\nby the investigation in New York, continued a disreputable régime in\r\nBoston, and installed a faction in Baltimore no better than the one\r\nturned out. Besides, the appointment to lucrative offices of the\r\nRepublican politicians who took active part in the Louisiana Returning\r\nBoard had closely associated him with the spoils system.[1567]\r\nMoreover, his failure to remove offending officials discredited his\r\nown rule and created an unfavourable sentiment, because after\r\nprovoking the animosity of office-holders and arousing the public he\r\nleft the order to execute itself. Yet the people plainly believed in\r\nthe President's policy of conciliation, sympathised with his desire to\r\nreform abuses in the civil service, and honoured him for his\r\nfrankness, his patriotism, and his integrity. During the months of\r\nAugust and September several Republican State conventions, notably\r\nthose in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Jersey\r\ncommended him, while Maine, under the leadership of Blaine, although\r\nrefusing to indorse unqualifiedly the policy and acts of the\r\nAdministration, refrained from giving any expression of\r\ndisapproval.[1568]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1566: In his speech at Woodstock, Conn., on July 4, Blaine\r\ndisapproved the President's action; a gathering of Republicans in New\r\nJersey, celebrating the return of Robeson from a foreign tour,\r\nindicated an unfriendly disposition; the Camerons of Pennsylvania,\r\nfather and son, exhibited dissent; one branch of the New Hampshire\r\nLegislature tabled a resolution approving the President's course; and\r\nan early Republican State convention in Iowa indirectly condemned it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1567: In H.R. 45th Cong., 3d Sess., No. 140, p. 48 (Potter\r\nreport) is a list of those connected with the Louisiana count\r\n\"subsequently appointed to or retained in office.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1568: These conventions occurred as follows: Ohio, August 2;\r\nMaine, August 9; Pennsylvania, September 6; Wisconsin, September 12;\r\nMassachusetts, September 20; New Jersey, September 25. See New York\r\npapers on the day following each.]\r\n\r\nNew York's Republican convention assembled at Rochester on September\r\n26. The notable absence of Federal office-holders who had resigned\r\ncommitteeships and declined political preferment attracted attention,\r\notherwise the membership of the assembly, composed largely of the\r\nusual array of politicians, provoked no comment. Conkling and Cornell\r\narrived early and took possession. In 1874 and in 1875 the Senator's\r\nfriends fought vigorously for control, but in 1877 the divided\r\nsentiment as to the President's policies and the usual indifference\r\nthat follows a Presidential struggle inured to their benefit, giving\r\nthem a sufficient majority to do as they pleased.\r\n\r\nThus far Conkling had not betrayed his attitude toward the\r\nAdministration. At the time of his departure for Europe in search of\r\nhealth, when surrounded by the chief Federal officials of the city, he\r\nsignificantly omitted words of approbation or criticism, and with\r\nequal dexterity avoided the expression of an opinion in the many\r\nwelcoming and serenade speeches amidst which his vacation ended in\r\nAugust. No doubt existed, however, as to his personal feeling. The\r\nselection of Evarts for secretary of state in place of Thomas C. Platt\r\nfor postmaster general did not make him happy.[1569] George William\r\nCurtis's ardent support of the President likewise aided in separating\r\nhim from the White House. Nevertheless, Conkling's attitude remained a\r\nprofound secret until Thomas C. Platt, as temporary chairman, began\r\nthe delivery of a carefully prepared speech.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1569: New York _Tribune_, February 28, 1877.]\r\n\r\nPlatt was then forty-four years old. He was born in Owego, educated at\r\nYale, and as a man of affairs had already laid the foundation for the\r\nsuccess and deserved prominence that crowned his subsequent business\r\ncareer. Ambition also took him early into the activities of public\r\npolitical life, his party having elected him county clerk at the age\r\nof twenty-six and a member of Congress while yet in his thirties. His\r\nfriends, attracted by his promise-keeping and truth-telling, included\r\nmost of the people of the vicinage. He was not an orator, but he\r\npossessed the resources of tact, simplicity, and bonhomie, which are\r\nserviceable in the management of men.[1570] Moreover, as an organiser\r\nhe developed in politics the same capacity for control that he\r\nexhibited in business. He had quickness of decision and flexibility of\r\nmind. There was no vacillation of will, no suspension of judgment, no\r\nprocrastination that led to harassing controversy over minor details.\r\nHe seemed also as systematic in his political purposes as he was\r\norderly in his business methods. These characteristic traits, well\r\nmarked in 1877, were destined to be magnified in the next two decades\r\nwhen local leaders recognised that his judgment, his capacity, and his\r\nskill largely contributed to extricate the party from the chaotic\r\nconditions into which continued defeat had plunged it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1570: \"Platt and I imbibed politics with our earliest\r\nnutriment. I was on the stump the year I became a voter, and so was\r\nhe. I was doing the part of a campaign orator and he was chief of the\r\ncampaign glee club. The speech amounted to little in those days unless\r\nit was assisted by the glee club. In fact the glee club largely drew\r\nthe audience and held it. The favorite song of that day was 'John\r\nBrown's Body,' and the very heights of ecstatic applause were reached\r\nwhen Brother Platt's fine tenor voice rang through the arches of the\r\nbuilding or the trees of the woodland, carrying the refrain, 'We'll\r\nhang Jeff Davis on a sour apple tree, while John Brown's soul goes\r\nmarching on.'\"--Chauncey M. Depew, _Speeches_, 1896 to 1902, p. 237.]\r\n\r\nConkling early recognised Platt's executive ability, and their\r\nfriendship, cemented by likeness of views and an absence of rivalry,\r\nkept them sympathetically together in clearly defined fields of\r\nactivity. In a way each supplemented the other. Platt was neither\r\nself-opinionated nor overbearing. He dealt with matters political with\r\nthe light touch of a man of affairs, and although without sentiment or\r\nideals, he worked incessantly, listened attentively, and was anxious\r\nto be useful, without taking the centre of the stage, or repelling\r\nsupport by affectations of manner. But like Conkling he relied upon\r\nthe use of patronage and the iron rule of organisation, and too little\r\nupon the betterment of existing political conditions.\r\n\r\nThis became apparent when, as temporary chairman, he began to address\r\nthe convention. He startled the delegates by calling the distinguished\r\nSecretary of State a \"demagogue,\" and other Republicans who differed\r\nwith him \"Pecksniffs and tricksters.\" As he proceeded dissent blended\r\nwith applause, and at the conclusion of his speech prudent friends\r\nregretted its questionable taste. In declining to become permanent\r\npresident Conkling moved that \"the gentleman who has occupied the\r\nchair thus far with the acceptance of us all\" be continued. This\r\naroused the Administration's backers, of whom a roll-call disclosed\r\n110 present.[1571]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1571: The vote stood 311 to 110 in favour of the motion.]\r\n\r\nThe platform neither approved nor criticised the President's Southern\r\npolicy, but expressed the hope that the exercise of his constitutional\r\ndiscretion to protect a State government against domestic violence\r\nwould result in peace, tranquillity, and justice. Civil service reform\r\nwas more artfully presented. It favoured fit men, fixed tenure, fair\r\ncompensation, faithful performance of duty, frugality in the number of\r\nemployés, freedom of political action, and no political assessments.\r\nMoreover, it commended Hayes's declaration in his letter of acceptance\r\nthat \"the officer should be secure in his tenure so long as his\r\npersonal character remained untarnished and the performance of his\r\nduty satisfactory,\" and recommended \"as worthy of consideration,\r\nlegislation making officers secure in a limited fixed tenure and\r\nsubject to removal only as officers under State laws are removed in\r\nthis State on charges to be openly preferred and adjudged.\"[1572] This\r\nparalleled the President's reform except as to freedom of political\r\naction, and in support of that provision it arrayed a profoundly\r\nimpressive statement, showing by statistics that Hayes's order, if\r\napplied to all State, county, and town officials in New York, would\r\nexclude from political action one voter out of every eight and\r\none-half. If this practical illustration exhibited the weakness of the\r\nPresident's order it also anticipated what the country afterwards\r\nrecognised, that true reform must rest upon competitive examination\r\nfor which the Act of March 3, 1871 opened the way, and which President\r\nHayes had directed for certain positions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1572: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1877, pp. 562-563.]\r\n\r\nBut despite the platform's good points, George William Curtis,\r\nconstruing its failure to endorse the Administration into censure of\r\nthe President, quickly offered a resolution declaring Hayes's title to\r\nthe presidency as clear and perfect as that of George Washington, and\r\ncommending his efforts in the permanent pacification of the South and\r\nfor the correction of abuses in the civil service.[1573] Curtis had\r\nnever sought political advantage for personal purposes. The day he\r\ndrifted away from a clerkship in a business firm and landed among the\r\nphilosophers of Brook Farm he became an idealist, whom a German\r\nuniversity and years of leisure travel easily strengthened. So fixed\r\nwas his belief of moral responsibility that he preferred, after his\r\nunfortunate connection with _Putnam's Magazine_, to lose his whole\r\nfortune and drudge patiently for sixteen years to pay a debt of\r\n$60,000 rather than invoke the law and escape legal liability. He was\r\nan Abolitionist when abolitionism meant martyrdom; he became a\r\nRepublican when others continued Whigs; and he stood for Lincoln and\r\nemancipation in the months of dreadful discouragement preceding\r\nSheridan's victories in the Shenandoah. He was likewise a civil\r\nservice reformer long in advance of a public belief, or any belief at\r\nall, that the custom of changing non-political officers on merely\r\npolitical grounds impaired the efficiency of the public service,\r\nlowered the standard of political contests, and brought reproach upon\r\nthe government and the people. It is not surprising, therefore, that\r\nhe stood for a President who sought to re-establish a reform that had\r\nbroken down under Grant, and although the effort rested upon an\r\nExecutive order, without the permanency of law, he believed that any\r\nattempt to inaugurate a new system should have the undivided support\r\nof the party which had demanded it in convention and had elected a\r\nPresident pledged to establish it. Moreover, the President had offered\r\nCurtis his choice of the chief missions, expecting him to choose the\r\nEnglish. Remembering Irving in Spain, Bancroft in Germany, Motley in\r\nEngland, and Marsh in Italy, it was a great temptation. But Curtis,\r\nappreciating his \"civic duty,\" remained at home, and now took this\r\noccasion to voice his support of the Executive who had honoured\r\nhim.[1574]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1573: New York _Tribune_, September 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1574: Curtis declined chiefly from the motive ascribed in\r\nLowell's lines:\r\n\r\n    \"At courts, in senates, who so fit to serve?\r\n    And both invited, but you would not swerve,\r\n    All meaner prizes waiving that you might\r\n    In civic duty spend your heat and light,\r\n    Unpaid, untrammelled, with a sweet disdain.\r\n    Refusing posts men grovel to attain.\"\r\n      --_Lowell's Poems_, Vol. 4, pp. 138-139.]\r\n\r\nHis speech, pitched in an exalted key, sparkled with patriotic\r\nutterances and eloquent periods, with an occasional keen allusion to\r\nConkling. He skilfully contrasted the majority's demand for harmony\r\nwith Platt's reference to Evarts as a \"demagogue\" and to civil service\r\nreform as a \"nauseating shibboleth.\" He declared it would shake the\r\nconfidence of the country in the party if, after announcing its\r\nprinciples, it failed to commend the agent who was carrying them out.\r\nApproval of details was unnecessary. Republicans did not endorse\r\nLincoln's methods, but they upheld him until the great work of the\r\nmartyr was done. In the same spirit they ought to support President\r\nHayes, who, in obedience to many State and two or three National\r\nconventions, had taken up the war against abuses of the civil service.\r\nIf the convention did not concur in all his acts, it should show the\r\nDemocratic party that Republicans know what they want and the man by\r\nwhom to secure such results.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of abuses in the civil service he told the story of\r\nLincoln looking under the bed before retiring to see if a\r\ndistinguished senator was waiting to get an office,[1575] referred to\r\nthe efforts of Federal officials to defeat his own election to the\r\nconvention, and declared that the President, by his order, intended\r\nthat a delegate like himself, having only one vote, should not meet\r\nanother with one hundred votes in his pocket obtained by means of\r\npolitical patronage. Instead of the order invading one's rights it was\r\nintended to restore them to the great body of the Republicans of New\r\nYork, who now \"refuse to enter a convention to be met--not by brains,\r\nnot always by mere intelligence, not always by convictions, or by\r\nrepresentative men, but by the forms of power which federal patriots\r\nassume.\" He did \"not believe any eminent Republican, however high his\r\nambition, however sore his discontent, hoped to carry the Republican\r\nparty of the United States against Rutherford B. Hayes. Aye, sir, no\r\nsuch Republican, unless intoxicated with the flattery of parasites, or\r\nblinded by his own ambition.\" He spoke of Conkling's interest in\r\npublic affairs as beginning contemporaneously with his own, of their\r\nwork side by side in 1867, and of their sustaining a Republican\r\nPresident without agreement in the details of his policy, and he\r\nclosed with the prayer that they might yet see the Republican party\r\nfulfilling the hope of true men everywhere, who look to it for\r\nhonesty, for reform, and for pacification.[1576]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1575: See Chapter XII., p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1576: New York _Tribune_, September 27, 1877.]\r\n\r\nConkling had been waiting for Curtis as the American fleet waited for\r\nthe Spanish at Santiago. Curtis had adorned the centre of opposition\r\nuntil he seemed most to desire what would most disappoint Conkling.\r\nFor months prior to the Cincinnati convention _Harper's Weekly_\r\nbristled with reasons that in its opinion unfitted the Senator for\r\nPresident, and advertised to the country the desire at least of a\r\nlarge minority of the party in New York to be rid of him. With\r\nconsummate skill he unfolded Conkling's record, and emphasised his\r\ndefence of the questionable acts that led to a deep distrust of\r\nRepublican tendencies. To him the question was not whether a National\r\nconvention could be persuaded to adopt the Senator as its candidate,\r\nbut whether, \"being one of the leaders that had imperilled the party,\r\nit was the true policy for those who patriotically desired Republican\r\nsuccess.\" Furthermore, Curtis had a habit of asking questions. \"With\r\nwhat great measure of statesmanship is his name conspicuously\r\nidentified?\"[1577] and, as if this admitted of no reply, he followed it\r\nwith more specific inquiries demanding to know \"why the Senator had\r\nled a successful opposition to Judge Hoar for the Supreme Bench,\" and\r\nbecome \"the ardent supporter of Caleb Cushing for chief justice, and\r\nof Alexander Shepherd for commissioner of the District of Columbia?\"\r\nThese interrogatories seemed to separate him from statesmen of high\r\ndegree and to place him among associates for whom upright citizens\r\nshould have little respect.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1577: \"He [Conkling] never linked his name with any important\r\nprinciple or policy.\"--_Political Recollections_, George W. Julian, p.\r\n359.\r\n\r\n\"Strictly speaking Senator Conkling was not an originator of\r\nlegislative measures. He introduced few bills which became laws. He\r\nwas not an originator, but a moulder of legislation.... It may be said\r\nthat during his last seven years in the Senate, no other member of\r\nthat body has, since the time of Webster and Clay, exercised so much\r\ninfluence on legislation.\"--Alfred R. Conkling, _Life of Conkling_,\r\npp. 645-649.]\r\n\r\nNor was this all. The part Greeley took at Chicago to defeat Seward,\r\nCurtis played at Cincinnati to defeat Conkling. He declared him the\r\nespecial representative of methods which the best sentiment of the\r\nparty repudiated, and asserted that his nomination would chill\r\nenthusiasm, convince men of the hopelessness of reform within the\r\nparty, and lose the vote indispensable for the election of the\r\nRepublican candidate. If his words were parliamentary, they were not\r\nless offensive. Once only did he strike below the belt. In the event\r\nof the Senator's nomination he said \"a searching light would be turned\r\nupon Mr. Conkling's professional relations to causes in which he was\r\nopposed to attorneys virtually named by himself, before judges whose\r\nselection was due to his favour.\"[1578]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1578: _Harper's Weekly_, March 11, 1876. For other editorials\r\nreferred to, see February 5; April 8, 15, 29; May 20; June 3, 17,\r\n1876; March 24; April 21; July 21; August 11; September 22, 1877.]\r\n\r\nThis thrust penetrated the realm of personal integrity, a\r\ncharacteristic in which Conkling took great pride. Perhaps the hostile\r\ninsinuation attracted more attention because it prompted the public,\r\nalready familiar with the occult influences that persuaded Tweed's\r\njudges, to ask why men who become United States judges upon the\r\nrequest of a political boss should not be tempted into favourable\r\ndecisions for the benefactor who practises in their courts? Curtis\r\nimplied that something of the kind had happened in Conkling's\r\nprofessional career. Disappointment at Cincinnati may have made the\r\npresidential candidate sore, but this innuendo rankled, and when he\r\nrose to oppose Curtis's resolution his powerful frame seemed in a\r\nthrill of delight as he began the speech which had been laboriously\r\nwrought out in the stillness of his study.\r\n\r\nThe contrast in the appearance of the two speakers was most striking.\r\nCurtis, short, compact, punctilious in attire, and exquisitely\r\ncultured, with a soft, musical voice, was capable of the noblest\r\ntenderness. Conkling, tall, erect, muscular, was the very embodiment\r\nof physical vigour, while his large, well-poised head, his strong\r\nnose, handsome eyes, well-cut mouth, and prominent chin, were\r\nexpressive of the utmost resolution. The two men also differed as much\r\nin mind as in appearance. Curtis stood for all the force and feeling\r\nthat make for liberal progressive principles; Conkling, the product of\r\na war age, of masterly audacity and inflexible determination,\r\nrepresented the conservative impulse, with a cynical indifference to\r\ncriticism and opposition.\r\n\r\nThe preface to his attack was brief. This was a State convention to\r\nnominate candidates, he said in substance, and the National\r\nAdministration was not a candidate or in question. He repelled the\r\nidea that it suggested or sanctioned such a proceeding, and although\r\nbroad hints had been heard that retribution would follow silence, any\r\none volunteering for such a purpose lacked discretion if not\r\nsincerity. \"Who are these men who, in newspapers or elsewhere, are\r\ncracking their whips over me and playing schoolmaster to the party?\r\nThey are of various sorts and conditions. Some of them are the\r\nman-milliners, the dilettante and carpet knights of politics, whose\r\nefforts have been expended in denouncing and ridiculing and accusing\r\nhonest men.... Some of them are men who, when they could work\r\nthemselves into conventions, have attempted to belittle and befoul\r\nRepublican administrations and to parade their own thin veneering of\r\nsuperior purity. Some of them are men who, by insisting that it is\r\ncorrupt and bad for men in office to take part in politics, are\r\nstriving now to prove that the Republican party has been unclean and\r\nvicious all its life.... Some of these worthies masquerade as\r\nreformers. Their vocation and ministry is to lament the sins of other\r\npeople. Their stock in trade is rancid, canting self-righteousness.\r\nThey are wolves in sheep's clothing. Their real object is office and\r\nplunder. When Dr. Johnson defined patriotism as the last refuge of a\r\nscoundrel, he was unconscious of the then undeveloped capabilities and\r\nuses of the word reform.... Some of these new-found party overseers\r\nwho are at this moment laying down new and strange tenets for\r\nRepublicans, have deemed it their duty heretofore, upon no\r\nprovocation, to make conventions and all else the vehicle of\r\ndisparaging Republican administrations. Some of them sat but yesterday\r\nin Democratic conventions, some have sought nominations at the hands\r\nof Democrats in recent years, and some, with the zeal of neophytes and\r\nbitterness of apostates, have done more than self-respecting Democrats\r\nwould do to vilify and slander their government and their\r\ncountrymen.... They forget that parties are not built up by\r\ndeportment, or by ladies' magazines, or gush.... The grasshoppers in\r\nthe corner of a fence, even without a newspaper to be heard in,\r\nsometimes make more noise than the flocks and herds that graze upon a\r\nthousand hills.... For extreme license in criticism of administrations\r\nand of everybody connected with them, broad arguments can no doubt be\r\nfound in the files of the journal made famous by the pencil of Nast.\r\nBut a convention may not deem itself a chartered libertine of\r\noracular and pedantic conceits.\"\r\n\r\nConkling could not comprehend why Republicans of New York should be\r\nthought predisposed to find fault with Hayes. Without their votes he\r\ncould not have become the candidate. \"Even the member from Richmond\r\nwas, I believe, in the end prevailed upon, after much difficulty, to\r\nconfer his unique and delicate vote also.\" New York congressmen, with\r\nfew exceptions, heartily supported the measure without which Hayes\r\nwould never have been effectually inaugurated. No opposition had come\r\nfrom New York. What, then, is the meaning and purpose of constantly\r\naccusing Republicans of this State of unfriendly bias? Wanton assaults\r\nhad been made upon Republicans, supposed to be inspired by the\r\nchampions and advisers of the President. For not doing more in the\r\ncampaign of 1876, he, an office-holder, had been denounced by the same\r\nmen who now insist that an office-holder may not sign even a notice\r\nfor a convention. No utterance hostile to men or measures had\r\nproceeded from him. Not a straw had been laid in the way of any man.\r\nStill he had been persistently assaulted and misrepresented by those\r\nclaiming to speak specially for the Administration. A word of greeting\r\nto his neighbours had drawn down bitter and scornful denunciations\r\nbecause it did not endorse the Administration.\r\n\r\n\"These anxious and super-serviceable charioteers seem determined to\r\nknow nothing but the President and his policy and them crucified....\r\nThe meaning of all this is not obscured by the fact that the new\r\nPresident has been surrounded and courted by men who have long purred\r\nabout every new Administration.... Some of these disinterested\r\npatriots and reformers have been since the days of Pierce the friends\r\nand suitors of all Administrations and betrayers of all. The assaults\r\nthey incite are somewhat annoying. It would have been a luxury to\r\nunfrock some of them, but it has seemed to me the duty of every\r\nsincere Republican to endure a great deal rather than say anything to\r\nintroduce division or controversy into party ranks.... I am for\r\npeace.... I am for everything tending to that end.... I am for one\r\nthing more--the success of the Administration in everything that is\r\njust and wise and real.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator thought Hayes deserved the same support other Republican\r\nadministrations had received. Whenever he is right he should be\r\nsustained; whenever misled by unwise or sinister advice, dissent\r\nshould be expressed. This right of judgment is the right of every\r\ncitizen. He exercised it in Congress under Lincoln and Grant, who\r\nnever deemed an honest difference of opinion cause for war or quarrel,\r\n\"nor were they afflicted by having men long around them engaged in\r\nsetting on newspapers to hound every man who was not officious or\r\nabject in fulsomely bepraising them. The matters suggested by the\r\npending amendment,\" he continued, \"are not pertinent to this day's\r\nduties, and obviously they are matters of difference. They may promote\r\npersonal and selfish aims, but they are hostile to concord and good\r\nunderstanding between Republicans at a time when they should all be\r\nunited everywhere, in purpose and action. Let us agree to put\r\ncontentions aside and complete our task. Let us declare the purposes\r\nand methods which should guide the government of our great State.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this plea for harmony, the Senator commented briefly upon the\r\nremarks of other delegates, complimented Platt, and then turned again\r\nupon Curtis. Being assured that the latter did not refer to him as the\r\nSenator for whom Lincoln looked under the bed, he concluded: \"Then I\r\nwithhold a statement I intended to make, and I substitute for it a\r\nremark which I hope will not transgress the proprieties or liberties\r\nof this occasion. It is this: If a doubt arose in my mind whether the\r\nmember from Richmond intended a covert shot at me, that doubt sprang\r\nfrom the fact that that member has published, in a newspaper, touching\r\nme, not matters political--political assaults fairly conducted no man\r\never heard me complain of--but imputations upon my personal integrity\r\nso injurious and groundless, that as I think of them now, nothing but\r\nthe proprieties of the occasion restrain me from denouncing them and\r\ntheir author as I feel at liberty to do in the walks of private life.\r\nMr. President, according to that Christian code which I have been\r\ntaught, there is no atonement in the thin lacquer of public courtesy,\r\nor of private ceremonial observance, for the offence one man does\r\nanother when he violates that provision of the Decalogue, which,\r\nspeaking to him, says, 'Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy\r\nneighbour,' and which means thou shalt not do it, whatever thy\r\npersonal or political pique or animosity may be. The member from\r\nRichmond did me honour overmuch in an individual if not personal\r\nexhortation wherein he was pleased to run some parallel between\r\nhimself and me.... Let me supplement the parallel by recalling a\r\nremark of a great Crusader when Richard of England and Leopold of\r\nAustria had held dispute over the preliminaries of battle: 'Let the\r\nfuture decide between you, and let it declare for him who carries\r\nfurthest into the ranks of the enemy the sword of the cross.'\"[1579]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1579: Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, pp. 538-549; New York\r\n_Tribune_, October 1, 1877.]\r\n\r\nFrom a mere reading of this speech it is difficult, if not impossible,\r\nto realise its effect upon those who heard it.[1580] As an oratorical\r\nexhibition the testimony of friends and of foes is alike offered in\r\nits unqualified praise. He spoke distinctly and with characteristic\r\ndeliberation, his stateliness of manner and captivating audacity\r\ninvesting each sentence with an importance that only attaches to the\r\nutterances of a great orator. The withering sneer and the look of\r\ncontempt gave character to the sarcasms and bitter invectives which he\r\nscattered with the prodigality of a seed-sower. When he declared\r\nCurtis a \"man-milliner,\" his long, flexible index finger and eyes\r\nablaze with resentment pointed out the editor as distinctly as if he\r\nhad transfixed him with an arrow, while the slowly pronounced\r\nsyllables, voiced in a sliding, descending key, gave the title a\r\ncartoon effect. Referring to the parallel in Curtis's peroration, he\r\nlaid his hand on his heart, bowed toward his antagonist with mock\r\nreverence, and distorted his face with an expression of ludicrous\r\nscorn. In repelling the innuendo as to his \"personal integrity,\" the\r\nsuppressed anger and slowly spoken words seemed to preface a challenge\r\nto mortal combat, and men held their breath until his purpose cleared.\r\nThe striking delivery of several keen thrusts fixed them in the\r\nmemory. Given in his deep, sonorous tones, one of these ran much as\r\nfollows: \"When Doc-tor-r-r Ja-a-awnson said that patr-r-riotism-m was\r\nthe l-a-w-s-t r-r-refuge of a scoundr-r-rel he ignor-r-red the\r\nenor-r-rmous possibilities of the word r-refa-awr-rm.\"[1581] Other\r\nsentences, now historic, pleased opponents not less than friends. That\r\nparties are not upheld by \"deportment, ladies' magazines, or gush\"\r\ninstantly caught the audience, as did \"the journal made famous by the\r\npencil of Nast,\" and the comparison suggested by Edmund Burke of the\r\nnoise of \"grasshoppers in the corner of a fence even without a\r\nnewspaper to be heard in.\"[1582]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1580: After the death of Thomas B. Reed of Maine, this speech\r\nwas found in his scrap-book among the masterpieces of sarcasm and\r\ninvective.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1581: White, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 171.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1582: \"Because half-a-dozen grasshoppers under a fern make\r\nthe field ring with their importunate chink, while thousands of great\r\ncattle beneath the shadow of the British oak chew the cud and are\r\nsilent, pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are the only\r\ninhabitants of the field, that of course they are many in number, or\r\nthat, after all, they are other than the little, shrivelled, meagre,\r\nhopping, though loud and troublesome, insects of the hour.\"--Edmund\r\nBurke. George H. Jennings, _Anecdotal History of the British\r\nParliament_, p. 159.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these moments of accord between speaker and hearers\r\ndeepened by contrast the depth of bitterness existing between him and\r\nthe friends of the President. His denunciation of Curtis had included\r\nEvarts if not other members of the Administration, and during the\r\nrecital of the rhythmical sentences of arraignment dissent mingled\r\nwith applause. \"He was hissed,\" said a reporter of long experience,\r\n\"as I have never heard any speaker hissed at a convention\r\nbefore.\"[1583] A friend to whom Conkling read the speech on the\r\npreceding Sunday pronounced it \"too severe,\" and the nephew excluded\r\nthe epithet \"man-milliner\" from the address as published in his\r\nuncle's biography.[1584] The contemporary press, reflecting the injury\r\nwhich Conkling's exuberance of denunciation did his cause, told how\r\nits effect withered as soon as oratory and acting had ceased. Within\r\nan hour after its delivery Charles E. Fitch of the Rochester\r\n_Democrat-Chronicle_, voicing the sentiment of the Senator's best\r\nfriends, deprecated the attack. Reading the article at the breakfast\r\ntable on the following morning, Conkling exclaimed, \"the man who wrote\r\nit is a traitor!\" It was \"the man\" not less than the criticism that\r\nstaggered him. Fitch was a sincere friend and a writer with a purpose.\r\nHis clear, incisive English, often forcible and at times eloquent, had\r\nwon him a distinct place in New York journalism, not more by his\r\neditorials than by his work in various fields of literature, and his\r\nthought usually reflected the opinion of the better element of the\r\nparty. To Conkling it conveyed the first intimation that many\r\nRepublican papers were to pronounce his address unfortunate, since it\r\nexhorted to peace and fomented bitter strife.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1583: New York _Tribune_ (correspondence), September 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1584: Alfred R. Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, p. 540.]\r\n\r\nCurtis refused to make public comment, but to Charles Eliot Norton,\r\nhis intimate friend, he wrote: \"It was the saddest sight I ever knew,\r\nthat man glaring at me in a fury of hate, and storming out his foolish\r\nblackguardism. I was all pity. I had not thought him great, but I had\r\nnot suspected how small he was. His friends, the best, were\r\nconfounded. One of them said to me the next day, 'It was not amazement\r\nthat I felt, but consternation.' I spoke offhand and the report is\r\nhorrible. Conkling's speech was carefully written out, and therefore\r\nyou do not get all the venom, and no one can imagine the\r\nMephistophelean leer and spite.\"[1585]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1585: Edward Cary, _Life of Curtis_, p. 258.]\r\n\r\nConkling closed his speech too late at night for other business,[1586]\r\nand in the morning one-half of the delegates had disappeared. Those\r\nremaining occupied less than an hour in the nomination of\r\ncandidates.[1587]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1586: Curtis's amendment was defeated by 311 to 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1587: The candidates were: Secretary of State, John C.\r\nChurchill, Oswego; Comptroller, Francis Sylvester, Columbia;\r\nTreasurer, William L. Bostwick, Ithaca; Attorney-General, Grenville\r\nTremaine, Albany; Engineer, Howard Soule, Onondaga.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE TILDEN RÉGIME ROUTED\r\n\r\n1877\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result at Rochester, so unsatisfactory to a large body of\r\ninfluential men to whom the President represented the most patriotic\r\nRepublicanism, was followed at Albany by a movement no less\r\ndisappointing to a large element of the Democratic party.[1588] In\r\ntheir zeal to punish crime Secretary of State Bigelow and\r\nAttorney-General Fairchild had made themselves excessively obnoxious\r\nto the predatory statesmen of the canal ring, who now proposed to\r\ndestroy the Tilden régime. Back of them stood John Kelly, eager to\r\nbecome the master, and determined to accomplish what he had failed to\r\ndo at St. Louis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1588: The Democratic State convention met at Albany on\r\nOctober 3, 1877.]\r\n\r\nAs if indifferent to the contest Bigelow had remained in Europe with\r\nTilden, and Fairchild, weary of the nervous strain of office-holding,\r\nrefused to make an open canvass for the extension of his official\r\nlife. Nevertheless, the friends of reform understood the importance of\r\nrenominating the old ticket. It had stood for the interest of the\r\npeople. Whatever doubt might have clouded the public mind as to\r\nTilden's sincerity as an ardent, unselfish reformer, Republicans as\r\nwell as Democrats knew that Bigelow and Fairchild represented an\r\nuncompromising hostility to public plunderers, and that their work, if\r\nthen discontinued, must be shorn of much of its utility. Their friends\r\nunderstood, also, the importance of controlling the temporary\r\norganisation of the convention, otherwise all would be lost.\r\n\r\nThe result of the Presidential struggle had seriously weakened Tilden.\r\nIn the larger field of action he had displayed a timid, vacillating\r\ncharacter, and the boldest leaders of his party felt that in the final\r\ntest as a candidate he lost because he hesitated. Besides, the\r\nimmediate prospect of power had disappeared. Although Democrats talked\r\nof \"the great Presidential crime,\" and seemed to have their eyes and\r\nminds fastened on offices and other evidences of victory, they\r\nrealised deep in their hearts that Hayes was President for four years,\r\nand that new conditions and new men might be existent in 1880.\r\nMoreover, many Democratic leaders who could not be classed as selfish,\r\nfelt that Tilden, in securing the advantageous position of a reformer,\r\nhad misrepresented the real Democratic spirit and purpose in the\r\nState. They deeply resented his course in calling about him, to the\r\nexclusion of recognised and experienced party advisers, men whom he\r\ncould influence, who owed their distinction to his favour, and who\r\nwere consequently devoted to his fortunes. Upon some of these he\r\nrelied to secure Republican sympathy, while he depended upon\r\nDemocratic discipline to gain the full support of his party. If events\r\nfavoured his designs and the exigencies of an exciting Presidential\r\nelection concealed hostility, these conditions did not placate his\r\nopponents, who began plotting his downfall the moment the great\r\nhistoric contest ended. This opposition could be approximately\r\nmeasured by the fact that the entire party press of the State, with\r\nthree exceptions, disclosed a distinct dislike of his methods.[1589]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1589: New York _Tribune_, September 1, 1877.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Tilden's friends held control. Governor Robinson, an\r\nexecutive of remarkable force, sensitively obedient to principles of\r\nhonest government and bold in his utterances, remained at the head of\r\na devoted band which had hitherto found its career marked by triumph\r\nafter triumph, and whose influence was still powerful enough to rally\r\nto its standard new men of strength as well as old leaders flushed\r\nwith recent victories. Robinson's courageous words especially engaged\r\nthe attention of thoughtful Democrats. He did not need to give reasons\r\nfor the opposition to John Bigelow, or the grievance against Charles\r\nS. Fairchild, whose court docket sufficiently exposed the antagonism\r\nbetween canal contractors and the faithful prosecutor. But in his\r\nfascinating manner he told the story of the Attorney-General's heroic\r\nfirmness in refusing to release Tweed.[1590] In Robinson's opinion the\r\nvicious classes, whose purposes discovered themselves in the\r\ndepredations of rings and weakness for plunder, were arrayed against\r\nthe better element of the party which had temporarily deprived the\r\nwrong-doers of power, and he appealed to his friends to rescue\r\nadministrative reform from threatened defeat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1590: \"The man who has been the most effective organiser of\r\ncorruption strikes boldly for release. He is arrayed as an element in\r\nthe combination which attacks the Governor and Democratic State\r\nofficers, and which seeks to reverse their policy.\"--Albany _Argus_,\r\nOctober 4, 1877.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor was not unmindful of his weakness. Besides Tilden's loss\r\nof prestige, the renomination of the old ticket encountered the\r\nobjection of a third term, aroused the personal antagonism of hundreds\r\nof men who had suffered because of its zeal, and arrayed against it\r\nall other influences that had become hostile to Tilden through envy or\r\notherwise during his active management of the party. Moreover, he\r\nunderstood the cunning of John Kelly and the intrigue of his\r\nlieutenants. Knowing that contesting delegations excluded precincts\r\nfrom taking part in the temporary organisation, these men had sought\r\nto weaken Tilden by creating fictitious contests in counties loyal to\r\nhim, thus offsetting John Morrissey's contest against Tammany. It was\r\na desperate struggle, and the only gleam of light that opened a way to\r\nTilden's continued success came from the action of the State\r\nCommittee, which gave David B. Hill of Chemung 19 votes for temporary\r\nchairman to 14 for Clarkson N. Potter of New York. The victory,\r\nordinarily meaning the control of the Committee on Credentials,\r\nrestored hope if not confidence.\r\n\r\nHill was the friend of Robinson. Although his name had not then become\r\na household word, he was by no means unknown throughout the State. He\r\nhad come into public life as city attorney in 1864 at the age of\r\ntwenty-one, and had shown political instincts for the most part\r\nadmirable. Of those to go to the Assembly in 1871 to aid in the work\r\nof judicial purification, Hill was suggested by O'Conor and Tilden as\r\none of the trustworthy lawyers, and in February, 1872, when the\r\nlegislative committee began its investigation into the charges\r\npresented by the Bar Association against Judges Barnard, Cardozo,\r\nIngraham, and McCunn with a view to their impeachment, Hill sat by the\r\nside of Tilden. It was recognised that he belonged to the coterie of\r\nable men who stood at the front of the reform movement.\r\n\r\nHis personal habits, too, commended him. He seems to have been\r\nabsolved from the love of wine, and if the love of a good woman did\r\nnot win him, he created a substantial home among his books, and worked\r\nwhile others feasted. He talked easily, he learned readily, and with\r\nthe earnestness of one who inherited an ambition for public life he\r\ncarefully equipped himself for a political as well as a professional\r\ncareer. He had a robust, straightforward nature. Men liked his\r\ncourage, his earnestness, his effectiveness as a debater, and his\r\ndeclared purposes which were thoroughly in unison with the spirit of\r\nhis party. But it was his boldness, tempered with firmness, which\r\njustified Robinson in singling him out for chairman. Still, the\r\ncourage exhibited as a presiding officer in one of the stormiest\r\nconventions that ever assembled in the Empire State did not win him\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nThe Kelly opposition raised no question of principle. The platform\r\ndenounced the defeat of Tilden as due to fraud, applauded Hayes for\r\nhis Southern policy, declared for reapportionment of the State, and\r\nbitterly assailed railroad subsidies. But it had no words of\r\nunkindness for Tilden and Robinson. Indeed, with a most sublime\r\ndisplay of hypocrisy, Kelly pointed with pride to the fruits of their\r\nadministrations, made illustrious by canal reforms, economy, and the\r\nrelentless prosecution of profligate boards and swindling contractors,\r\nand vied with the apostles of administrative reform in calling them\r\n\"fearless\" and \"honest,\" and in repudiating the suggestion of desiring\r\nother directing spirits. His only issue involved candidates. Should it\r\nbe the old ticket or a new one? Should it be Bigelow for a third term,\r\nor Beach, the choice of the ring? In opposing the old ticket several\r\ndelegates extended their hostility only to Bigelow; others included\r\nthe attorney-general. Only a few demanded an entire change. But\r\nTammany and the Canal ring tactfully combined these various elements\r\nwith a skill never before excelled in a State convention. Their\r\nprogramme, sugar-coated with an alleged affection for Tilden, was\r\narranged to satisfy the whim of each delegate, while Robinson's\r\npolicy, heavily freighted with well doing, encountered the odium of a\r\nthird-term ticket.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Governor's control of the chairmanship assured him\r\nvictory unless Hill yielded too much. But Kelly was cunning and quick.\r\nAfter accepting Hill without dissent, he introduced a resolution\r\nproviding that the convention select the committee on contested seats.\r\nTo appoint this committee was the prerogative of the chairman, and\r\nHill, following Cornell's bold ruling in 1871, could have refused to\r\nput the motion. When he hesitated delegates sprang to their feet and\r\nenthroned pandemonium.[1591] During the cyclone of epithets and\r\ninvective John Morrissey for the last time opposed John Kelly in a\r\nState convention. His shattered health, which had already changed\r\nevery lineament of a face that successfully resisted the blows of\r\nYankee Sullivan and John C. Heenan, poorly equipped him for the\r\nprolonged strain of such an encounter, but he threw his envenomed\r\nadjectives with the skill of a quoit-pitcher.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1591: \"How the Kelly faction got control of the Democratic\r\nconvention and used it for the supposed benefit of Kelly is hardly\r\nworth trying to tell. A description of the intrigues of a parcel of\r\nvulgar tricksters is neither edifying nor entertaining reading.\"--The\r\n_Nation_, October 11, 1877.]\r\n\r\nDistributed about the hall were William Purcell, DeWitt C. West,\r\nGeorge M. Beebe, John D. Townsend, and other Tammany talkers, who had\r\na special aptitude for knockdown personalities which the metropolitan\r\nside of a Democratic convention never failed to understand. Their loud\r\nvoices, elementary arguments, and simple quotations neither strained\r\nthe ears nor puzzled the heads of the audience, while their jibes and\r\njokes, unmistakable in meaning, sounded familiar and friendly.\r\nTownsend, a lawyer of some prominence and counsel for Kelly, was an\r\neffective and somewhat overbearing speaker, who had the advantage of\r\nbeing sure of everything, and as he poured out his eloquence in\r\nlanguage of unmeasured condemnation of Morrissey, he held attention if\r\nhe did not enlighten with distracting novelty.\r\n\r\nMorrissey admitted he was wild in his youth, adding in a tone of\r\nsincere penitence that if he could live his life over he would change\r\nmany things for which he was very sorry. \"But no one, not even Tweed\r\nwho hates me,\" he exclaimed, pointing his finger across the aisle in\r\nthe direction of Kelly, \"ever accused me of being a thief.\"\r\nMorrissey's grammar was a failure. He clipped his words, repeated his\r\nphrases, and lacked the poise of a public speaker, but his opponents\r\ndid not fail to understand what he meant. His eloquence was like that\r\nof an Indian, its power being in its sententiousness, which probably\r\ncame from a limited vocabulary.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the convention Robinson's forces had a clear\r\nmajority,[1592] but in the presence of superior generalship, which\r\nforced a roll-call before the settlement of contests, Tammany and the\r\nCanal ring, by a vote of 169 to 114, passed into control. To Tilden's\r\nfriends it came as the death knell of hope, while their opponents,\r\nwild with delight, turned the convention into a jubilee. \"This is the\r\nfirst Democratic triumph in the Democratic party since 1873,\" said\r\nJarvis Lord of Monroe. \"It lets in the old set.\"[1593]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1592: New York _Tribune_, October 4, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1593: New York _Tribune_, October 4.\r\n\r\n\"The defeat of Bigelow and Fairchild will be the triumph of the\r\nreactionists who think that the golden era of the State was in the\r\ndays before thieves were chastised and driven out of the Capital and\r\nState House.\"--Albany _Argus_, October 4, 1877.]\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Credentials Committee's report seated Tammany,\r\nmade Clarkson N. Potter permanent chairman, and turned over the party\r\nmachine. Pursuing their victory the conquerors likewise nominated a\r\nnew ticket.[1594] Quarter was neither asked nor offered. Robinson had\r\nsquarely raised the issue that refusal to continue the old officials\r\nwould be repudiation of reform, and his friends, as firmly united in\r\ndefeat as in victory, voted with a calm indifference to the threats of\r\nthe allied power of canal ring and municipal corruptionists. Indeed,\r\ntheir boast of going down with colours flying supplemented the\r\nvigorous remark of the Governor that there could be no compromise with\r\nTweed and canal thieves.[1595]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1594: Secretary of State, Allen C. Beach, Jefferson;\r\nComptroller, Frederick P. Olcott, Albany; Treasurer, James Mackin,\r\nDutchess; Attorney-General, Augustus Schoonmaker, Jr., Ulster;\r\nEngineer, Horatio Seymour, Jr., Oneida.\r\n\r\nOn October 6, a convention of Labor Reformers, held at Troy, nominated\r\na State ticket with John J. Junio for Secretary of State. The\r\nProhibition and Greenback parties also nominated State officers, Henry\r\nHagner and Francis E. Spinner being their candidates for secretary of\r\nstate. The Social Democrats likewise presented a ticket with James\r\nMcIntosh at its head.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1595: New York _Tribune_, October 4.]\r\n\r\nThis apparently disastrous result encouraged the hope that\r\nRepublicans, in spite of Conkling's indiscretion at Rochester, might\r\nprofit by it as they did in 1871. Upon the surface Republican\r\ndifferences did not indicate bitterness. Except in the newspapers no\r\norganised opposition to the Senator had appeared, and the only mass\r\nmeeting called to protest against the action of the Rochester\r\nconvention appealed for harmony and endorsed the Republican\r\ncandidates.[1596] Even Curtis, the principal speaker, although\r\nindulging in some trenchant criticism, limited his remarks to a\r\ndefence of the Administration. Nevertheless, the presence of William\r\nJ. Bacon, congressman from the Oneida district, who voiced an intense\r\nadmiration for the President and his policies, emphasised the fact\r\nthat the Senator's home people had elected a Hayes Republican. Indeed,\r\nthe Senator deemed it essential to establish an organ, and in October\r\n(1877) the publication of the Utica _Republican_ began under the\r\nguidance of Lewis Lawrence, an intimate friend. It lived less than two\r\nyears, but while it survived it reflected the thoughts and feelings of\r\nits sponsor.[1597]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1596: This meeting was held in New York City on October 10.\r\nSee New York papers of the 11th.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1597: \"The Utica _Republican_ is an aggressive sheet. It\r\ncalls George William Curtis 'the Apostle of Swash.'\"--New York\r\n_Tribune_, October 27.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign presented several confusing peculiarities. Governor\r\nRobinson in his letter to a Tammany meeting refused to mention the\r\nDemocratic candidates, and Tilden, after returning from Europe,\r\nexpressed the belief in his serenade speech that \"any nominations that\r\ndid not promise coöperation in the reform policy which I had the\r\nhonour to inaugurate and which Governor Robinson is consummating will\r\nbe disowned by the Democratic masses.\"[1598] This was a body-blow to\r\nthe Ring. Its well-directed aim also struck the ticket with telling\r\neffect, for its election involved the discontinuance of Fairchild's\r\nspirited canal prosecutions. On the other hand, the adoption of the\r\nrecent amendment, substituting for the canal commission a\r\nsuperintendent of public works to be appointed by the Governor, made\r\nthe election of Olcott and Seymour especially desirable, since it\r\nwould give Robinson and his reforms stronger support than Tilden had\r\nin the State board. Yet it could not be denied that the success of the\r\nAlbany ticket would be construed as a defeat of Tilden's ascendency.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1598: _Ibid._, November 2.]\r\n\r\nSimilar confusion possessed the Republican mind. A large body of men,\r\nresenting the Rochester convention's covert condemnation of the\r\nPresident's policies, hesitated to vote for candidates whose victory\r\nwould be attributed to Republican opposition to the Administration.\r\nThis singular political situation made a very languid State campaign.\r\nAn extra session of Congress called Conkling to Washington, Tilden\r\nretired to Gramercy Park, the German-Independent organisation limited\r\nits canvass to the metropolis, and the candidates of neither ticket\r\ngot a patient hearing. Other causes contributed to the Republican\r\ndulness. Old leaders became inactive and government officials refused\r\nto give money because of their interpretation of the President's civil\r\nservice order, while rawness and indifference made newer leaders\r\ninefficient. After the October collapse in Ohio conditions became\r\nhopelessly discouraging.[1599] The tide set more heavily in favour of\r\nthe Democracy, and each discordant Republican element, increasing its\r\ndistrust, practically ceased work lest the other profit by it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1599: Democrats elected a governor by 22,520 plurality and\r\ncarried the Legislature by forty on joint ballot.--Appleton's\r\n_Cyclopædia_, 1877, p. 621.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the hunt for State senators, involving the election of a\r\nUnited States Senator in 1879, provoked animated contests which\r\ncentred about the candidacy of John Morrissey, whom Republicans and\r\nthe combined anti-Tammany factions backed with spirit. Morrissey had\r\ncarried the Tweed district for senator in 1874, and the taunt that no\r\nother neighbourhood would elect a notorious gambler and graduate of\r\nthe prize-ring goaded him into opposing Augustus Schell in one of the\r\nfashionable districts of the metropolis. Schell had the advantage of\r\nwealth, influence, long residence in the precinct, and the\r\nenthusiastic support of Kelly, who turned the contest into a battle\r\nfor the prestige of victory. For the moment the fierceness of the\r\nfight excited the hopes of Republicans that the State might be\r\ncarried, and to spread the influence of the warring Democratic\r\nfactions into all sections of the commonwealth, Republican journals\r\nmade a combined attack upon Allen C. Beach.\r\n\r\nLike Sanford E. Church, Beach was a courteous, good-natured\r\npolitician, who tried to keep company with a canal ring and keep his\r\nreputation above reproach. But his character did not refine under the\r\ntests imposed upon it. His policy of seeming to know nothing had\r\nresulted in doubling the cost of canal repairs during his four years\r\nin office. A careful analysis of his record showed that only once did\r\nhe vote against the most extravagant demands of the predatory\r\ncontractors. This did not prove him guilty of corruption, \"but when as\r\nthe steady servant of the canal ring,\" it was asked, \"he voted\r\nthousands and thousands of dollars, sometimes at the rate of a hundred\r\nthousand a day, into the pockets of men whom he knew to be thieves,\r\nand on claims which he must have known were full of fraud, was he not\r\nlending himself to corruption?\"[1600] This charge his opponents\r\ncirculated through many daily and scores of weekly papers, making the\r\nweakness of his character appear more objectionable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1600: New York _Tribune_, November 3, 1877.]\r\n\r\nTo these attacks Beach affected an indifference which he did not\r\nreally feel, for the pride of a candidate who desires the respect of\r\nhis neighbours is not flattered by their distrust of his integrity.\r\nChurch had felt the iron enter his soul, and had Tilden and the\r\nreformers rearoused the moral awakening that refused to tolerate the\r\nChief Justice in 1874, Beach must have fallen the victim of his\r\npartiality to a coterie of political associates willing to benefit at\r\nthe expense of his ruin. As it was he received a plurality of 11,000,\r\nwhile Seymour and Olcott, his associates upon the ticket, obtained\r\n35,000 and 36,000 respectively.[1601]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1601: Total vote of John J. Junio (Labour Reformer), 20,282;\r\nHenry Hagner (Prohibitionist), 7,230; John McIntosh (Social Democrat),\r\n1,799; Francis E. Spinner (Greenback), 997.--Appleton's _Cyclopædia_,\r\n1877, p. 566.]\r\n\r\nThe election of State senators in which Conkling had so vital an\r\ninterest exhibited the work of influential Hayes Republicans, who,\r\nopenly desiring his destruction, defeated his candidates in Brooklyn,\r\nRochester, and Utica.[1602] Nevertheless, by carrying eighteen of the\r\nthirty-two districts he saved fighting ground for himself in the\r\nsucceeding year.[1603] Indeed, he was able to point to the popular vote\r\nand declare that he was as strong in New York as the President was in\r\nOhio. It was known, too, that if Morrissey survived, the Senator would\r\nprofit by the prize-fighter's remarkable majority of nearly 4,000 over\r\nAugustus Schell, a victory which ranked as the crowning achievement of\r\nthe senatorial campaign.[1604] But Morrissey, prostrated by his\r\nexertions, did not live to reciprocate. He spent the winter in Florida\r\nand the early spring in Saratoga. Finally, after the loss of speech,\r\nhis right arm, which had so severely punished Yankee Sullivan, became\r\nparalysed, and on May 1 (1878) Lieutenant-governor Dorsheimer\r\nannounced his death to the Senate. \"It is doubtful,\" added a colleague\r\nin eulogy, \"if such boldness and daring in political annals were ever\r\nshown as he displayed in his last canvass.\"[1605]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1602: \"We elected our district attorney by 2,336 majority,\r\nbut the candidate for State senator, who was known to represent\r\nSenator Conkling, although personally popular and most deserving, was\r\nbeaten by 1,133.... It is fair to say that the unpopularity of the\r\nfederal office-holders, who are Mr. Conkling's most zealous\r\nsupporters, is in part the cause of this remarkable result.\" Interview\r\nof Ellis H. Roberts.--New York _Tribune_, November 10, 1877.\r\n\r\n\"The energies of all the opposition to me were concentrated upon that\r\ndistrict. I believe Tammany and the lofty coterie of Republican\r\ngentlemen in this city (New York) threw money into my district to\r\ncarry it against me.... Had we been sufficiently aroused and sagacious\r\nwe could have defeated this manoeuvre, but we found out too late. We\r\nsent the tickets to the polls, in the ward in which I live, at\r\ndaylight, as did the Democrats. Not one of our tickets was found at\r\nthe polls. They were all thrown into the canal.\" Interview with\r\nConkling.--New York _Herald_, November 9, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1603: The Legislature of 1878 had in the Senate: 18\r\nRepublicans, 13 Democrats, 1 Independent; in the Assembly: 66\r\nRepublicans, 61 Democrats, 1 Independent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1604: Tammany elected its entire county ticket. Its majority\r\nfor the State ticket was 30,520.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1605: New York _Times_, May 2, 1878.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nGREENBACKERS SERVE REPUBLICANS\r\n\r\n1878\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Democrats rejoiced over their victory in 1877, a new\r\ncombination, the elements of which had attracted little or no\r\nattention, was destined to cause serious disturbance. Greenbackism had\r\nnot invaded New York in 1874-5, when it flourished so luxuriantly in\r\nOhio, Indiana, and other Western States. Even after the party had\r\nnominated Peter Cooper for President in 1876, it polled in the Empire\r\nState less than 1,500 votes for its candidate for governor, and in\r\n1877, having put Francis E. Spinner, the well-known treasurer of the\r\nUnited States, at the head of its ticket, its vote fell off to less\r\nthan 1,000.\r\n\r\nMeantime the labour organisations, discontented because of long\r\nindustrial inaction, had formed a Labour Reform party. This\r\norganisation gradually increased its strength, until, in 1877, it\r\npolled over 20,000 votes. Encouraged by success its leaders held a\r\nconvention at Toledo, Ohio, on February 22 (1878), and resolved to\r\ncontinue the Cooper movement. It resented the resumption of specie\r\npayment, favoured absolute paper money, and demanded payment of the\r\npublic debt in greenbacks. On May 10 the executive council, calling\r\nthemselves Nationalists, coalesced with the Greenbackers, and issued a\r\ncall for a National Greenback Labour Reform convention to assemble at\r\nSyracuse on July 25. This sudden extension of the movement attracted\r\nwidespread attention, and although the convention was marked by great\r\nturbulence and guided by inconspicuous leaders, it seemed as if by\r\nmagic to take possession of a popular issue which gathered about its\r\nstandard thousands of earnest men. Gideon J. Tucker, a former\r\nDemocratic secretary of state, who had led the Americans in 1859, was\r\nnominated for judge of the Court of Appeals. To its platform it added\r\ndeclarations favouring a protective tariff and excluding the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the Greenback question earlier in the year by the\r\nolder parties had materially strengthened the Nationalists. Democratic\r\nconventions distinctly favoured their chief issue, and Republicans\r\nemployed loose and vague expressions. So accomplished and experienced\r\na politician as Thurlow Weed complimented the bold declarations of\r\nBenjamin Butler of Massachusetts, who had left the Republicans to\r\nbecome the independent leader of a vast mass of voters that accepted\r\nhis Greenback theories and joined in his sneers at honest money.\r\nRepublican congressmen, returning from Washington, told how their\r\nparty held Greenback views and why Greenbackers ought to support it.\r\nThe Secretary of the Republican Congressional Committee practically\r\nannounced himself a Greenback Republican, and Blaine's position seemed\r\nequivocal. During the entire financial debate in Congress, Conkling\r\nsaid nothing to mould public opinion upon the question of sound money,\r\nwhile the Utica _Republican_, his organ, thought it a \"mistake to\r\narray the Republican party, which originated the Greenback, as an\r\nexclusively hard-money party.... It is not safe or wise to make the\r\nfinances a party question.\"[1606] As late as July 30, the evening\r\npreceding the Maine convention, Blaine objected to the phrase \"gold or\r\nits equivalent,\" preferring the word \"coin,\" which subsequently\r\nappeared in the platform.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1606: The Utica _Republican_, July 1, 1878.]\r\n\r\nThe election in Maine, hailed with joy by every organ of the Greenback\r\nmovement, showed how profound was the political disturbance. The\r\nresult made it plain that the chief political issue was one of common\r\nhonesty, and that an alliance of Democratic and Greenback interests\r\nthreatened Republican ascendency. In the presence of such danger\r\nRepublican leaders, recognising that harmony could alone secure\r\nvictory, called a State convention to meet at Saratoga on September\r\n26. As the time for this important event approached the impression\r\ndeepened that real harmony must rest upon an acceptance of the\r\nPresident's plea for honest money and the honest payment of the\r\nnation's bonds. The word \"coin\" seemed insufficient, since both coin\r\nand currency should be kept at par with gold, and although this would\r\nmake Republicans \"an exclusively hard-money party,\" which Conkling's\r\norgan characterised as a \"mistake,\" the common danger proved a\r\nsufficient magnet to unite the two factions on a platform declaring\r\nthat national pledges should be redeemed in letter and spirit, that\r\nthere should be no postponement of resumption, and that permanent\r\nprosperity could rest alone on the fixed monetary standard of the\r\ncommercial world.\r\n\r\nTo further exclude just cause of offence Conkling, in accepting the\r\nchairmanship of the convention, broke his long silence upon the\r\ncurrency question, and without sarcasm or innuendo honoured the\r\nPresident by closely following the latter's clear, compact, and\r\nconvincing speeches on hard money. George William Curtis led in the\r\nfrequent applause. Speaking of convention harmony the _Times_ declared\r\nthat during the address \"there seemed to be something in the air which\r\nmade children of strong men. Many of the delegates were affected to\r\ntears.\"[1607] Curtis also stirred genuine enthusiasm. He had not been\r\ncaptious as to the form of the platform. To him it sufficed if the\r\nconvention keyed its resolutions to the President's note for sound\r\nmoney, which had become the Administration's chief work, and although\r\nthe spectacle of Curtis applauding and supplementing Conkling's speech\r\nseemed as marvellous as it was unexpected, it did not appear out of\r\nplace. Indeed, the environment at Saratoga differed so radically from\r\nconditions at Rochester that it required a vivid fancy to picture\r\nthese men as the hot combatants of the year before. The brilliant,\r\nclosely packed Rochester audience, the glare of a hundred gas jets,\r\nand an atmosphere surcharged with intense hostility, had given place\r\nto gray daylight, a sullen sky, and a morning assemblage tempered into\r\nharmony by threatened danger. The absence of the picturesque greatly\r\ndisappointed the audience. The labour of reading a speech from printed\r\nproofs marred Conkling's oratory, and Curtis' effort to compliment the\r\nPresident without arousing resentment spoiled the rhetorical finish\r\nthat usually made his speeches enjoyable. But the prudence of the\r\nspeakers and the cordial reception of the platform proved thoroughly\r\nacceptable to the delegates, who nominated George F. Danforth for the\r\nCourt of Appeals and then separated with the feeling that the State\r\nmight be redeemed.[1608]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1607: New York _Times_ (correspondence), September 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1608: A single roll-call resulted as follows: George F.\r\nDanforth, Monroe, 226; Joshua M. Van Cott, Kings, 99; George Parsons,\r\nWestchester, 79. The Prohibition State convention, which assembled at\r\nAlbany on April 24, had nominated Van Cott.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Democratic State convention which assembled at Syracuse\r\non September 25 became more violent and boisterous than its\r\npredecessor. Confident of defeat unless Tammany participated in the\r\npreliminary organisation, John Kelly, through his control of the State\r\nCommittee, secured Albert P. Laning of Erie for temporary chairman.\r\nLaning ruled that the roll of delegates as made up by the State\r\ncommittee should be called except those from New York and Kings, and\r\nas to these he reserved his decision. In obedience thereto the vote of\r\nuncontested delegations stood 132 to 154 in favour of Tilden and\r\nRobinson, whereas the admission of Tammany and Kings would make it 181\r\nto 195 in favour of Kelly. Would the chair include these contested\r\ndelegations in the roll-call? To admit one side and exclude the other\r\nbefore the settlement of a contest was a monstrous proposition. The\r\nhistory of conventions did not furnish a supporting precedent.\r\nNevertheless, Laning, wishing to succeed Dorsheimer as lieutenant-governor\r\nin 1879 and relying upon Tammany to nominate and elect him, had\r\nevidenced a disposition to rule in the Boss's favour, and when, at\r\nlast, he did so, the angry convention sprang to its feet. For three\r\nhours it acted like wild men.[1609] Under a demand for the previous\r\nquestion Laning refused to recognise the Tilden delegates, and the\r\nlatter's tumult drowned the voice of the chair. Finally, physical\r\nexhaustion having restored quiet, Kings County declined to vote and\r\nTammany was added without being called. This left the result 154 to\r\n195 in favour of John Kelly. An hour later Laning, hissed and\r\nlampooned, left the convention unthanked and unhonoured.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1609: \"The Democratic convention at Syracuse was perhaps the\r\nnoisiest, most rowdy, ill-natured, and riotous body of men which ever\r\nrepresented the ruling party of a great Commonwealth.\"--The _Nation_,\r\nOctober 3.]\r\n\r\nBut having gotten into the convention Tammany found it had not gotten\r\ninto power. The Tilden forces endorsed Robinson's administration,\r\nrefused to dicker with Greenbackers, whom Kelly was suspected of\r\nfavouring, and assuaged their passion by nominating George B. Bradley\r\nof Steuben for the Court of Appeals. While Tammany was looking for\r\nvotes to get in on, it bargained with St. Lawrence to support William\r\nH. Sawyer, whose success seemed certain. On the second ballot,\r\nhowever, Bradley's vote ran up to 194, while Sawyer's stopped at 183.\r\nThis left Kelly nothing but a majority of the State committee, which\r\nwas destined, in the hour of great need, to be of little service.\r\n\r\nThroughout the State the several parties put local candidates in the\r\nfield. The Greenbackers, exhibiting the activity of a young and\r\nconfident organisation, uniformly made congressional and legislative\r\nnominations. In one congressional district they openly combined with\r\nthe Democrats, and in several localities their candidates announced an\r\nintention of coöperating with the Democratic party. In the metropolis\r\nthe various anti-Tammany factions supported independent candidates for\r\nCongress and combined with Republicans in nominating a city ticket\r\nwith Edward Cooper for mayor.[1610] Kelly, acting for Tammany,\r\nselected Augustus Schell. This alignment made the leaders of the\r\ncombined opposition sanguine of victory. It added also to the\r\nconfidence of Republicans that the Greenbackers were certain to draw\r\nmore largely from the ranks of the Democrats.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1610: Cooper had resigned from Tammany in 1877.]\r\n\r\nThe difference between the Syracuse and Saratoga platforms was\r\nsignificant. Democrats declared \"gold and silver, and paper\r\nconvertible into coin at the will of the holder, the only currency of\r\nthe country.\"[1611] Convertible into what kind of coin? it was asked.\r\nCoin of depreciated value, or the fixed monetary standard of the\r\ncommercial world? The _Nation_ thought \"this platform not noticeable\r\nfor strength or directness of statement.\"[1612] The Republican plank\r\nwas clearer. \"We insist that the greenback shall be made as good as\r\nhonest coin ... that our currency shall be made the best currency, by\r\nmaking all parts of it, whether paper or coin, equivalent,\r\nconvertible, secure, and steady.\"[1613] As the campaign advanced a\r\nresistless tendency to force the older parties into the open made it\r\nplain that if the Democrats did not say just what they meant, the\r\nRepublicans meant more than they said, for their speakers and the\r\npress uniformly declared that the greenback, which had carried the\r\ncountry triumphantly through the war, must be made as good as gold.\r\nMeantime the Democratic leaders realised that \"fiat\" money had a\r\nstrange fascination for many of their party.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1611: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1878, p. 624.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1612: The _Nation_, October 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1613: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1878, p. 623.]\r\n\r\nTo add to Democratic embarrassment the _Tribune_, in the midst of the\r\ncanvass, began its publication of the cipher despatches which had\r\npassed between Tilden's personal friends and trusted associates during\r\nthe closing and exciting months of 1876.[1614] The shameful story,\r\nrevealed by the _Tribune's_ discovered key to the cipher, made a\r\nprofound impression. As shown elsewhere the important telegrams passed\r\nbetween Manton Marble and Smith M. Weed on one side, and Henry\r\nHavermeyer and William T. Pelton, Tilden's nephew, on the other.[1615]\r\nMarble had called McLin of the Florida board an \"ague-smitten pariah\"\r\nfor having charged him with attempted bribery, but these translated\r\ntelegrams corroborated McLin. Moreover, notwithstanding Tilden's\r\ncomprehensive and explicit denial, it sorely taxed the people's faith\r\nto believe him disconnected with the correspondence, since the corrupt\r\nbargaining by which he was to profit was carried on in his own house\r\nby a nephew, who, it was said, would scarcely have ventured on a\r\ntransaction so seriously affecting his uncle's reputation without the\r\nlatter's knowledge. \"Of their [telegrams] effect in ruining Mr.\r\nTilden's fortunes, or what was left of them,\" said the _Nation_,\r\n\"there seems no doubt.\"[1616] Whatever of truth this prophecy\r\ncontained, the revelation of the cipher despatches greatly\r\nstrengthened the Republican party and brought to a tragic end Clarkson\r\nN. Potter's conspicuous failure to stain the President.[1617]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1614: New York _Tribune_, October 8 and 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1615: See Chapter XXVII., pp. 350, 351, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1616: October 24, 1878.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1617: On May 13, 1878, Congressman Potter of New York secured\r\nthe appointment of a committee of eleven to investigate alleged frauds\r\nin the Florida and Louisiana Returning Boards, with authority to send\r\nfor persons and papers. He refused to widen the scope of the\r\ninvestigation to include all the States, presumably to avoid the\r\ndamaging evidence already known relating to Pelton's effort to secure\r\na presidential elector in Oregon. The _Tribune's_ timely exposure of\r\nthe telegrams turned the investigation into a Democratic boomerang.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the October elections likewise encouraged Republicans.\r\nIt indicated that the Greenback movement, which threatened to sweep\r\nthe country as with a tornado, had been stayed if not finally\r\narrested, and thenceforth greater activity characterised the canvass.\r\nConkling spoke often; Woodford, who had done yeoman service in the\r\nWest, repeated his happily illustrated arguments; and Evarts crowded\r\nCooper Union. In the same hall Edwards Pierrepont, fresh from the\r\nCourt of St. James, made a strenuous though belated appeal. Speaking\r\nfor the Democrats, Kernan advocated the gold standard, declaring it\r\nessential to commercial and the workingmen's prosperity. Erastus\r\nBrooks shared the same view, and Dorsheimer, with his exquisite choice\r\nof words, endeavoured to explain it to a Tammany mass meeting. John\r\nKelly, cold, unyielding, precise, likewise talked. There was little\r\nelasticity about him. He dominated Tammany like a martinet, naming its\r\ntickets, selecting its appointees, and outlining its policies. Indeed,\r\nhis rule had developed so distinctly into a one-man power that four\r\nanti-Tammany organisations had at last combined with the Republicans\r\nin one supreme effort to crush him, and with closed ranks and firm\r\npurpose this coalition exhibited an unwavering earnestness seldom\r\npresented in a local campaign.[1618] It was intimated that Kelly having\r\nin mind his reappointment as city comptroller in 1880, sought\r\nsurreptitiously to aid Cooper.[1619] Kelly saw his danger. He\r\nrecognised the power of his opponents, the weakness of Schell whom he\r\nhad himself named for mayor, and the strength of Cooper, a son of the\r\ndistinguished philanthropist, whose independence of character had\r\nbrought an honourable career; but the assertion that the Boss, bowing\r\nto the general public sentiment, gave Cooper support must be dismissed\r\nwith the apocryphal story that Conkling was in close alliance with\r\nTammany. Doubtless Kelly's disturbed mind saw clearly that he must\r\neventually divide his foes to recover lost prestige. Nevertheless, it\r\nwas after November 5, the day of Tammany's blighting overthrow, that\r\nhe shaped his next political move.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1618: In reference to Kelly's despotic rule see speeches of\r\nAnti-Tammany opponents in New York _Tribune_ (first page), October 31,\r\n1878.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1619: Myers, _History of Tammany_, p. 310.]\r\n\r\nThe election returns disclosed that the greatly increased\r\nGreenback-Labour vote, aggregating 75,000, had correspondingly\r\nweakened the Democratic party, especially in the metropolis, thus\r\nelecting Danforth to the Court of Appeals, Cooper as mayor, the entire\r\nanti-Tammany-Republican ticket, a large majority of Republican\r\nassemblymen, and twenty-six Republican congressmen, being a net gain\r\nof eight.[1620] Indeed, the divisive Greenback vote had produced a\r\nphenomenal crop of Republican assemblymen. After the crushing defeat\r\nof the Liberal movement in 1872 the Republicans obtained the\r\nunprecedented number of ninety-one. Now they had ninety-eight, with\r\nnineteen hold-over senators, giving them a safe working majority in\r\neach body and seventy-six on joint ballot. This insured the\r\nre-election of Senator Conkling, which occurred without Republican\r\nopposition on January 21, 1879. One month later the Utica _Republican_\r\nclosed its career. While its existence probably gratified the founder,\r\nit had done little more than furnish opponents with material for\r\neffective criticism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1620: Danforth, Republican, 391,112; Bradley, Democrat,\r\n356,451; Tucker, National, 75,133; Van Cott, Prohibitionist, 4,294.\r\nAssembly: Republicans, 98; Democrats, 28; Nationals, 2. Congress:\r\nRepublicans, 26; Democrats, 7. Cooper over Schell, 19,361.]\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, who supported Lieutenant-governor Dorsheimer for United\r\nStates senator, protested against granting Conkling a certificate of\r\nelection because no alteration of senate or assembly districts had\r\noccurred since the enumeration of 1875, as required by the\r\nconstitution, making the existing legislature, it was claimed, a\r\nlegislature _de facto_ and not _de jure_. This was a new way of\r\npresenting an old grievance. For years unjust inequality of\r\nrepresentation had fomented strife, but more recently the rapid growth\r\nof New York and Brooklyn had made the disparity more conspicuous,\r\nwhile continued Republican control of the Senate had created intense\r\nbitterness. In fact, a tabulated statement of the inequality between\r\nsenatorial districts enraged a Democrat as quickly as a red flag\r\ninfuriated the proverbial bull.[1621] Although the caucus refused to\r\nadopt the protest, it issued an address showing that New York and\r\nKings were entitled to ten senators instead of seven and forty-one\r\nassemblymen instead of thirty-one. These additional members, all\r\nbelonging to Democratic districts, said the address, are now awarded\r\nto twelve counties represented by Republicans. The deep indignation\r\nexcited throughout the State by such manifest injustice resulted in a\r\nnew apportionment which transferred one assemblyman from each of six\r\nRepublican counties to New York and Kings. This did not correct the\r\ngreater injustice in the senatorial districts, however, and in\r\npermitting the measure to become a law without his signature Governor\r\nRobinson declared that the \"deprivation of 150,000 inhabitants in New\r\nYork and Kings of their proper representation admits of no apology or\r\nexcuse.\"[1622]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1621: The following table gave great offense:\r\n\r\n+------------+-----------+-------------+\r\n| Democratic |           |             |\r\n| Districts. | Counties. | Population. |\r\n+------------+-----------+-------------+\r\n| 3d         | Kings     | 292,258     |\r\n| 8th        | New York  | 235,482     |\r\n| 7th        | New York  | 173,225     |\r\n| 2d         | Kings     | 172,725     |\r\n| 9th        | New York  | 167,530     |\r\n+------------+-----------+-------------+\r\n\r\n+------------+------------------------+-------------+\r\n| Republican |                        |             |\r\n| Districts. | Counties.              | Population. |\r\n+------------+------------------------+-------------+\r\n| 20th       | Herkimer, Otsego       |  89,338     |\r\n| 18th       | Jefferson, Lewis       |  90,596     |\r\n| 26th       | Ontario, Yates, Seneca |  91,064     |\r\n| 16th       | Clinton, Essex, Warren | 101,327     |\r\n| 27th       | Cayuga, Wayne          | 106,120     |\r\n+------------+------------------------+-------------+]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1622: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1879, p. 672.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF ARTHUR AND CORNELL\r\n\r\n1878-9\r\n\r\n\r\nOne week before the election of 1877 President Hayes nominated\r\nTheodore Roosevelt for collector of customs, L. Bradford Prince for\r\nnaval officer, and Edwin A. Merritt for surveyor, in place of Chester\r\nA. Arthur, Alonzo B. Cornell, and George H. Sharpe.[1623] The terms of\r\nArthur and Cornell had not expired, and although their removal had\r\nbeen canvassed and expected for several months, its coming shocked the\r\nparty and increased the disgust of the organisation. George William\r\nCurtis, with the approval of Evarts, urged the promotion of James L.\r\nBenedict for collector, a suggestion which the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury stoutly opposed. If Arthur, the latter argued, was to be\r\nremoved because of his identification with a system of administration\r\nwhich the President desired to abolish, no reason existed for\r\npromoting one who had made no effort to reform that system. No one\r\nquestioned Roosevelt's ability, high character, and fitness for the\r\nplace, but to those who resented the removal of Arthur his nomination\r\nwas an offence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1623: Sharpe's term having expired he had withdrawn his\r\napplication for reappointment.]\r\n\r\nChester A. Arthur had succeeded Thomas Murphy as collector of the port\r\nin November, 1871. He was then forty-seven years old, a lawyer of fair\r\nstanding and a citizen of good repute. He had studied under the\r\ntuition of his clergyman father, graduated at Union College, taught\r\nschool in his native Vermont, cast a first vote for Winfield Scott,\r\nand joined the Republican party at its organisation. At the outbreak\r\nof the rebellion Governor Morgan appointed him quartermaster-general,\r\nhis important duties, limited to the preparation and forwarding of\r\ntroops to the seat of war, being performed with great credit. When\r\nSeymour succeeded Morgan in 1863 Arthur resumed his law practice,\r\nsecuring some years later profitable employment as counsel for the\r\ndepartment of city assessments and taxes.\r\n\r\nFrom the first Arthur showed a liking for public life. He was the\r\ngentleman in politics. The skill of an artist tailor exhibited his\r\ntall, graceful figure at its best, and his shapely hands were\r\nimmaculately gloved. His hat advertised the latest fashion just as his\r\nexquisite necktie indicated the proper colour.[1624] He was equally\r\nparticular about his conduct. Whatever his environment he observed the\r\ndetails of court etiquette. His stately elegance of manner easily\r\nunbent without loss of dignity, and although his volatile spirits and\r\nmanner of living gave him the appearance of a _bon vivant_, lively and\r\njocose, with less devotion to work than to society, it was noticeable\r\nthat he attracted men of severer mould as easily as those vivacious\r\nand light-hearted associates who called him \"Chet.\" While Fenton,\r\nafter Greeley's failure as a leader, was gathering the broken threads\r\nof party management into a compact and aggressive organisation, Arthur\r\nenjoyed the respect and confidence of every local leader, who\r\nappreciated his wise reticence and perennial courtesy, blended with an\r\nability to control restless and suspicious politicians by timely hints\r\nand judicious suggestions. Indeed, people generally, irrespective of\r\nparty, esteemed him highly because of his kindness of heart, his\r\nconciliatory disposition, his lively sense of humour, and his\r\nsympathetic attention to the interests of those about him. He was\r\nneither self-opinionated, argumentative, nor domineering, but tactful,\r\nconsiderate, and persuasive. There was also freedom from prejudice,\r\nquickness of decision, a precise knowledge of details, and a\r\nflexibility of mind that enabled him to adapt himself easily to\r\nchanging conditions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1624: \"You remember, don't you, what Orville Baker told us\r\nabout Arthur's two passions, as he heard them discussed at Sam Ward's\r\ndinner in New York? New coats being one, he then having ordered\r\ntwenty-five from his tailor since the New Year came in.\"--Mrs. James\r\nG. Blaine, _Letters_ (January 28, 1882), Vol. 1, p. 294.]\r\n\r\nWhen Conkling finally wrested the Federal patronage from Fenton and\r\nsecured to himself the favour and confidence of the Grant\r\nadministration, Arthur bivouacked with the senior Senator so quietly\r\nand discreetly that Greeley accepted his appointment as collector\r\nwithout criticism. \"He is a young man of fair abilities,\" said the\r\neditor, \"and of unimpeached private character. He has filled no such\r\nrôle in public affairs as should entitle him to so important and\r\nresponsible a part, but as things go, his is an appointment of fully\r\naverage fitness and acceptability. With the man we have no difference;\r\nwith the system that made him collector we have a deadly quarrel. He\r\nwas Mr. Murphy's personal choice, and he was chosen because it is\r\nbelieved he can run the machine of party politics better than any of\r\nour great merchants.\"[1625]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1625: New York _Tribune_, November 22, 1871. See also,\r\n_Ibid._, November 21.]\r\n\r\nIn party initiative Arthur's judgment and modesty aided him in\r\navoiding the repellent methods of Murphy. He did not wait for\r\nemergencies to arise, but considering them in advance as possible\r\ncontingencies, he exercised an unobtrusive but masterful authority\r\nwhen the necessity for action came. He played an honest game of\r\ndiplomacy. What others did with Machiavellian intrigue or a cynical\r\nindifference to ways and means, he accomplished with the cards on the\r\ntable in plain view, and with motives and objects frankly disclosed.\r\nNo one ever thought his straightforward methods clumsy, or\r\nunbusinesslike, or deficient in cleverness. In like manner he studied\r\nthe business needs of the customs service, indicating to the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury the flagrant use of backstair wiles, and pointing out\r\nto him ways of reform.[1626] He sought in good faith to secure\r\nefficiency and honesty, and if he had not been pinioned as with ball\r\nand chain to a system as old as the custom-house itself, and upon\r\nwhich every political boss from DeWitt Clinton to Roscoe Conkling had\r\nrelied for advantage, he would doubtless have reformed existing\r\npeculation and irregularities among inspectors, weighers, gaugers,\r\nexaminers, samplers, and appraisers.[1627] Until this army of placemen\r\ncould be taken out of politics Secretary Sherman refused to believe it\r\npossible to make the custom-house \"the best managed business agency of\r\nthe government,\" and as Arthur seemed an inherent part of the system\r\nitself, the President wished to try Theodore Roosevelt.[1628] It is\r\nsafe to conclude, judging the father's work by the later achievements\r\nof his illustrious son, that the Chief Executive's choice would have\r\naccomplished the result had Conkling allowed him to undertake it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1626: See his letters to the Secretary of the Treasury, New\r\nYork _Tribune_, January 28, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1627: In his testimony before the Jay Commission, Arthur\r\nspoke of \"10,000 applicants,\" backed and pressed upon him with\r\nunabated energy by the most prominent men \"all over the country.\"--New\r\nYork _Tribune_, July 28, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1628: Arthur was offered an appointment as consul-general to\r\nParis.--See Theodore E. Burton, _Life of John Sherman_, p. 294.]\r\n\r\nWhen Conkling felt himself at ease, in congenial society, he displayed\r\nhis mastery of irony and banter, neither hesitating to air his opinion\r\nof persons nor shrinking from admissions which were candid to the\r\nverge of cynicism. At such times he had not veiled his intense dislike\r\nof the Administration. After Hayes's election his conversation\r\ndiscovered as aggressive a spirit as he had exhibited at Rochester,\r\nspeaking of the Secretary of State as \"little Evarts,\" and charging\r\nthe President with appointing \"a Democratic cabinet,\" whose principal\r\nlabour had been \"to withdraw Republican support from me.\" Apropos of\r\nSchurz, he told a story of the man who disbelieved the Bible because\r\nhe didn't write it. He criticised the Republican press for praising\r\nTilden as governor and \"lampooning\" him as a candidate for the\r\npresidency, pronounced Packard's title as good as Hayes's, and\r\ndeclared the President's \"objectionable and dishonourable\" record\r\nconsisted not in the withdrawal of the troops but in bargaining with\r\nSoutherners. \"Every man knows,\" he said, \"that on the face of the\r\nreturns Packard was more elected than Hayes. You cannot present those\r\nreturns in any form that will not give more legality to Packard as\r\nGovernor than to Hayes as President. People say this man assumes all\r\nthe virtues of reform in an office which he has gained by the simple\r\nrepudiation of the ladder that lifted him. It is the general record of\r\nusurpers that though sustained they do their favours to the other\r\nside.... I have no faith in a President whose only distinct act is\r\ningratitude to the men who voted for him and to the party which gave\r\nhim its fealty. In the domain and forum of honour that sense of Mr.\r\nHayes's infidelity stands forward and challenges him. It is felt by\r\nhonest men all over the country. He smiles and showers on the\r\nopposition the proofs of a disturbed mind.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the civil service order the Senator was no less severe.\r\n\"That celebrated reformatory order was factional in its intent, made\r\nin the interests of envious and presuming little men. Sherman\r\n(secretary of the treasury) goes out to Ohio and makes speeches in\r\ndefiance of it; McCrary (secretary of war) goes to Iowa and manages a\r\nconvention in spite of it; and Devens (attorney-general) says the\r\norder meant itself to be disobeyed, and that the way to obey it was to\r\nviolate it.\"[1629]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1629: New York _Herald_, November 9, 1877. Respecting this\r\ninterview Conkling made a personal explanation in the Senate, in which\r\nhe said: \"Though some of the remarks in question may at some time have\r\nbeen made in private casual conversations, others of them never\r\nproceeded from me at any time.\"--New York _Tribune_, November 13. It\r\nis assumed that the portions quoted above, taken from a three-column\r\ninterview, are substantially correct, since they are corroborated by\r\nseveral persons now living (1908) who heard the Senator's expressions.\r\nSee, also, Alfred R. Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, pp. 552-554.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Conkling, in all his conversations, seemed to consider men who\r\ndiffered from him as enemies of the human race.\"--White,\r\n_Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 188.\r\n\r\n\"Conkling spoke with great severity of President Hayes, and said he\r\nhoped it would be the last time that any man would attempt to steal\r\nthe presidency.\"--Hoar, _Autobiography_, Vol. 2, p. 44.]\r\n\r\nConkling's criticism of the fitful execution of the civil service\r\norder was not too severe. Instead of justifying the expectations he\r\nhad aroused by vigorously enforcing the principles of his letter of\r\nacceptance and inaugural address, the President, as if inthralled by\r\nsome mysterious spell, had discredited his professions by his\r\nperformances. The establishment of a real change in the system of\r\nappointments and of office-holding control invited a severe contest,\r\nand success depended upon the courage and conviction of the\r\nAdministration itself. For firmness, however, Hayes substituted\r\nhesitation, compromise, and in some instances surrender. Numerous\r\ncases were cited in proof of this criticism, notably the reappointment\r\nof Chauncey I. Filley, postmaster at St. Louis, whom George William\r\nCurtis pronounced the most conspicuous office-holder in the country\r\nfor his active manipulation of politics. \"He is a shining example of\r\n'the thing to be reformed.'\"[1630]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1630: _Harper's Weekly_, December 8, 1877.]\r\n\r\nThe President's removal of Arthur and Cornell, it was argued, was no\r\nless irrational. In failing to charge them with inefficiency he\r\nsubjected himself to the graver charge of inconsistency, since his\r\nletter of acceptance and inaugural address declared in substance that\r\nefficient officers would be retained. The President meant, his friends\r\nassumed, that political activity nullified efficiency, to which\r\nopponents replied that the President, after inviting Arthur to carry\r\nout the recommendations of the Jay Commission, had condoned the\r\ncollector's wrong-doing if any existed, making him an agent for\r\nreform, and that his subsequent removal was simply in the interest of\r\nfaction. Cornell's case likewise presented a peg upon which to hang\r\nsevere criticism, since the Administration, when asked for the reason\r\nof his removal, dodged the decisive one. Such inconsistency showed\r\ntimidity and confusion instead of courage and conviction,\r\ndisappointing to friends and ridiculous to opponents.\r\n\r\nConkling made use of these and other points. Indeed, for more than six\r\nweeks after Congress convened he bent all his energies and diplomacy\r\nto defeat the confirmation of Roosevelt and Prince. That a Republican\r\nsenator might be substituted for a Democrat on the commerce committee,\r\nof which he was chairman and to which the nominations were referred,\r\nhe delayed action until a reorganisation of the Senate. Finally, in a\r\nforceful and pathetic speech, regarded by colleagues as his most\r\nimpressive address,[1631] he illuminated what he deemed an act of\r\ninjustice to Arthur and Cornell. It was less bitter perhaps than that\r\nin the contest with Fenton over the confirmation of Thomas Murphy, but\r\nno less carefully worked up and quite as successful. To the\r\nconsternation of the Administration, which relied upon a solid\r\nDemocratic party, the Senator won by a decisive vote, having the\r\nsupport of several Democrats and of all the Republicans except five.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1631: Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, p. 373.]\r\n\r\nIt was an important victory for Conkling, who must soon begin another\r\ncanvass for members of the Legislature. It sent a thrill of joy\r\nthrough the ranks of his friends, renewed the courage of\r\noffice-holding lieutenants, and compelled the Administration's\r\nsupporters to admit that the President was \"chiefly to blame.\"[1632]\r\nMoreover, the cordial support given Conkling by Blaine created the\r\nimpression that it had led to their complete reconciliation, a belief\r\nstrengthened by a conversation that subsequently occurred between them\r\non the floor of the Senate Chamber in full view of crowded galleries.\r\nDavid Davis had added to the tableau by putting an arm around each,\r\nthus giving the meeting the appearance of an unusually friendly\r\none.[1633]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1632: _Harper's Weekly_, December 22, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1633: New York _Tribune_, December 17, 1878.]\r\n\r\nBut the President, if he had previously omitted to say what he meant,\r\ndetermined not to surrender, and on July 11 (1878), after the\r\nadjournment of Congress, he suspended Arthur and Cornell and appointed\r\nEdwin A. Merritt and Silas W. Burt. Arthur's suspension did not\r\ninvolve his integrity. Nor was any distinct charge lodged against\r\nCornell. Their removal rested simply upon the plea that the interests\r\nof the public service demanded it, and the death of Roosevelt very\r\nnaturally opened the way for Merritt.[1634]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1634: Theodore Roosevelt died on February 9.]\r\n\r\nAll his life Merritt had been serviceable and handy in politics. After\r\nholding successively several local offices in St. Lawrence, the people\r\nsent him to the Assembly in 1859 and in 1860. When the rebellion began\r\nhe entered the quartermaster's and commissary departments, and at its\r\nclose served as quartermaster-general of the State until appointed\r\nnaval officer in 1869, an office which he lost in 1870 when Conkling\r\ngot control of the patronage. Then he followed Fenton and Greeley into\r\nthe Liberal party, but returning with other leaders in 1874, he\r\naccepted the nomination for State treasurer in 1875, the year when\r\nadministrative reform accelerated Tilden's run for the White House.\r\nThis made him eligible for surveyor, an office to which he had been\r\nconfirmed in December, 1877. His unsought promotion to the\r\ncollectorship, however, was a testimonial to his ability. Whatever\r\nMerritt touched he improved. Whether quartermaster, naval officer, or\r\nsurveyor, he attended rigorously to duty, enforcing the law fairly and\r\nwithout favour, and disciplining his force into a high state of\r\nefficiency, so that revenues increased, expenses diminished, and\r\ncorruption talk ceased. In selecting him for collector, therefore, the\r\nPresident had secured the right type of man.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Hayes's action roiled the political waters. Conkling's\r\nfriends accused the President of violating his own principles, of\r\nendeavouring to set up a new machine, and of grossly insulting the\r\nSenator. On the other hand, Administration supporters maintained that\r\nthe law authorising removals was as obligatory as that empowering a\r\nsenator to advise and consent to appointments, and that in removing\r\nArthur the President did not insult Conkling any more than Conkling\r\ninsulted the President by rejecting the nomination of Roosevelt. This\r\nrenewal of an ugly quarrel was auguring ill for the Republicans, when\r\nthe organisation of the National Greenback-Labour-Reform party,\r\nsuddenly presenting a question which involved the integrity and\r\nwelfare of the country, put factional quarrels and personal politics\r\ninto eclipse.\r\n\r\nConkling had exhibited both tact and skill in that campaign. He did\r\nnot lead the gold column. In fact, it was not until the last moment\r\nthat the Saratoga committee on resolutions which he dominated,\r\nsubstituted \"the fixed monetary standard of the commercial world\" for\r\nthe word \"coin.\" But after the guide-boards pointed the way he became\r\na powerful champion of hard money. Besides, the moderation and good\r\ntemper with which he discussed the doctrine of the inflationists did\r\nmuch to hold dissenters within the party and justly entitled him to\r\nhigh praise. His unanimous re-election to the Senate followed as a\r\nmatter of course. Not that unanimity of action implied unanimity of\r\nfeeling. It was rather, perhaps, a yielding to the necessity of the\r\nsituation.[1635]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1635: The strength of the anti-Conkling sentiment was clearly\r\nshown in the contest for speaker of the Assembly. Thomas G. Alvord\r\nreceived 52 votes to 43 for George B. Sloan of Oswego. Although Sloan\r\nand his supporters declared for Conkling, Alvord was confessedly the\r\nConkling candidate.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to all appearances Conkling had recovered the prestige\r\nlost at Rochester. His conduct at the convention and in the campaign\r\nexcited the hope, also, that he would drop his opposition to Merritt\r\nand Burt. Such a course commended itself to the judgment of a large\r\nmajority of the New York delegation in Congress as well as to many\r\nstout legislative friends; but re-election seemed to have hardened his\r\nheart, and when, ten days after that event, he rose in the Senate to\r\ndefeat confirmation he exhibited the confidence of the man of\r\nGath.[1636]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1636: New York _Tribune_ (correspondence), February 1, 1879.]\r\n\r\nPrior to his re-election Conkling had not voluntarily moved in the\r\nmatter. To him the settlement of one thing at a time sufficed. Early\r\nin January, however, the Secretary of the Treasury, on his own\r\ninitiative and with the skill of a veteran legislator, had addressed\r\nthe President of the Senate, setting forth that Arthur's conduct of\r\nthe custom-house was neither efficient nor economical. To this Arthur\r\nanswered, denying inattention to business or loss of revenue, and\r\naffirming that he had recommended a system of reform upon which the\r\nSecretary had not acted.[1637] After the reception of this letter\r\nConkling demanded immediate action. But the Senate, by two majority,\r\npreferred to wait for Sherman's replication, and when that statement\r\ncame the Senate again, by a vote of 35 to 26, put off action until the\r\ndocument, with its many exhibits, could be carefully examined.[1638]\r\nThese delays augured ill for the Senator. It appeared that a\r\nDemocratic member of his own committee had left him, and on the day\r\nfixed for consideration other Democrats, while calmly discussing the\r\nmatter, disclosed a disposition to desert. Alarmed at their loss\r\nConkling suddenly moved to recommit, which was carried by a _viva\r\nvoce_ vote amidst shouts of approval and whispered assurances that\r\nfurther action should be deferred until a Democratic Senate convened\r\non March 4. Then some one demanded the yeas and nays.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1637: _Ibid._, January 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1638: These exhibits made a document of 423 pages, of which\r\n308 were extracts from the testimony taken by the Jay Commission, then\r\npublished for the first time.]\r\n\r\nBelieving the matter practically settled, Conkling, to improve the\r\nlast chance \"of freeing his mind,\" he said, unexpectedly took the\r\nfloor, and for more than an hour, with a bitterness and eloquence not\r\nexcelled at Rochester, assailed the President and those associated\r\nwith him. To illustrate the insincerity of the Administration's desire\r\nto reform the civil service he read several place-seeking letters\r\naddressed to Arthur while collector and written by the President's\r\nprivate secretary, by a member of the Cabinet, and other reformers.\r\nOne letter sought a position for the son of Justice Bradley, who had\r\nfigured conspicuously on the Electoral Commission. Such a scene had\r\nnever before been witnessed in the Senate. Exclamations of mock\r\nsurprise followed by fun-making questions and loud laughter added to\r\nthe grotesque exhibition. It was so ludicrous as to become pitiful and\r\npainful. Although no particular harm was done to anybody, the\r\nGovernment for the moment was made ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAt times Conkling was blessed with the gift of offence, and on this\r\noccasion he seems to have exercised it to its full capacity. Before he\r\nbegan speaking the Senate exhibited a readiness to recommit the\r\nnominations, but as he proceeded he lost ground, and when he finished\r\nseveral Republican senators, unwilling to afford another opportunity\r\nfor such a scene, demanded that the matter be disposed of at once and\r\nforever. Each succeeding name, as the roll-call proceeded on the\r\nmotion to recommit, showed more and more the change that had taken\r\nplace in senators' feelings. Failure to recommit turned defeat into\r\nconfusion, and confusion into disaster. When the three roll-calls were\r\nover it was found that Merritt had been confirmed by 33 to 24 and Burt\r\nby 31 to 19. An analysis of the \"pairs\" increased the rout, since it\r\ndisclosed that twenty-five Democrats and fifteen Republicans favoured\r\nconfirmation, while only seven Democrats and twenty-three Republicans\r\nopposed it. In other words, the Administration required only five\r\nDemocratic votes to match the strength of the dissatisfied\r\nRepublicans. Kernan, although he had spoken slightingly of Merritt,\r\nrefused to vote, but Blaine, who had joined heartily in the laughter\r\nprovoked by Conkling's thrusts as he read the letters, antagonised the\r\nPresident. This noticeable desire of the Maine statesman to attach his\r\nfortunes to those of the New York Senator neither escaped the\r\nattention nor faded from the memory of Secretary Sherman.\r\n\r\nThe next morning everybody knew what had happened. Although secrecy\r\nwas removed only from the vote, nothing of the seven hours' conflict\r\nremained untold, the result of which to all New Yorkers proved a great\r\nsurprise. They had supposed Conkling invincible in the Senate.\r\nNevertheless, to most Republicans, whether friends or foes, his defeat\r\non February 3 was a great relief. Merritt had made an excellent\r\ncollector, and a feeling existed, which had crystallised into a strong\r\npublic sentiment, that it was unwise to force into his place an\r\nofficial unsatisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nJOHN KELLY ELECTS CORNELL\r\n\r\n1879\r\n\r\n\r\nIf threatened danger had bred an artificial harmony among the\r\nRepublican factions of the State in 1878, the presence of a real\r\nperil, growing out of the control of both branches of Congress by the\r\nDemocrats, tended to bring them closer together in 1879. During a\r\nspecial session of the Forty-sixth Congress the Democratic majority\r\nhad sought, by a political rider attached to the army appropriation\r\nbill, to repeal objectionable election laws, which provided among\r\nother things for the appointment of supervisors and deputy marshals at\r\ncongressional elections. This law had materially lessened cheating in\r\nNew York City, and no one doubted that its repeal would be followed in\r\n1880 by scenes similar to those which had disgraced the metropolis\r\nprior to its enactment in 1870.\r\n\r\nBut the attempt to get rid of the objectionable Act by a rider on a\r\nsupply bill meant more than repeal. It implied a threat. In effect the\r\nDemocrats declared that if the Executive did not yield his veto power\r\nto a bare majority, the needed appropriations for carrying on the\r\ngovernment would be stopped. This practically amounted to revolution,\r\nand the debate that followed reawakened bitter partisan and sectional\r\nanimosities. \"Suppose in a separate bill,\" said Conkling, \"the\r\nmajority had, in advance of appropriations, repealed the national bank\r\nact and the resumption act, and had declared that unless the Executive\r\nsurrendered his convictions and yielded up his approval of the\r\nrepealing act, no appropriations should be made; would the separation\r\nof the bills have palliated or condoned the revolutionary purpose?\r\nWhen it is intended that, unless another species of legislation is\r\nagreed to, the money of the people, paid for that purpose, shall not\r\nbe used to maintain their government, the threat is revolution and its\r\nexecution is treasonable.\" Then he gave the mortal stab. Of the\r\nninety-three senators and representatives from the eleven disloyal\r\nStates, he said, eighty-five were soldiers in the armies of the\r\nrebellion, and their support of these \"revolutionary measures is a\r\nfight for empire. It is a contrivance to clutch the national\r\ngovernment. That we believe; that I believe.\"[1639] The President, by\r\nadvising the country through his spirited veto messages of the\r\ndesperate tactics invoked by the majority, added to Northern\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1639: Cooper, _American Politics_, Book 3, pp. 176-186.]\r\n\r\nIt was a losing battle to the Democrats. The longer they insisted the\r\nmore the Southern brigadiers were held up to public scorn as if they\r\nhad again betrayed their country, and when, finally, the appropriation\r\nbills were passed without riders, it left Republicans more firmly\r\nunited than at the beginning of the Hayes administration.[1640]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1640: The extra session of Congress adjourned July 1, 1879.]\r\n\r\nTwo months later the Republican State convention, held at Saratoga\r\n(September 3), evidenced this union.[1641] Every distinguished\r\nRepublican of the State was present save Thurlow Weed, whose\r\nfeebleness kept him at home. Conkling presided. With fine humour,\r\nGeorge William Curtis, the sound of whose flute-like voice brought a\r\nburst of applause, asked that the crowded aisles be cleared that he\r\nmight see the chairman. Conkling's speech excited close attention. It\r\nwas freer and more vivid because of more human interest than his\r\naddress of the year before, and his appeal for harmony, his\r\ndenunciation of revolutionary methods in Congress, and his demand that\r\nfreedmen be protected in their rights, brought strenuous, purposeful\r\napplause from determined men. The principles thus felicitously and\r\nrhetorically stated formed the basis of the platform, which pledged\r\nthe party anew to national supremacy, equal rights, free elections,\r\nand honest money. It also thanked the President for his recent\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1641: On August 29, the State convention of Nationals\r\nassembled at Utica, and nominated Harris Lewis of Herkimer, for\r\ngovernor. The platform opposed National banks and demanded an issue of\r\ngreenbacks at the rate of $50 per capita, at least. Lewis, who had\r\nbeen a member of the Assembly twenty years before, was president of\r\nthe Farmers' Alliance.\r\n\r\nThe State Prohibition convention met at Syracuse, September 3, and\r\nnominated a full State ticket, with John W. Mears of Oneida, for\r\ngovernor. The platform declared the license system the cornerstone of\r\nthe liquor traffic and favoured woman suffrage.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a disposition to contest the strength of the\r\norganisation and its methods boldly asserted itself. For months\r\nCornell had been Conkling's candidate for governor. A searching\r\ncanvass, extended into all sections of the State and penetrating the\r\nsecrets of men, had been noiselessly and ceaselessly carried on.\r\nIndeed, a more inquisitorial pursuit had never before been attempted,\r\nsince the slightest chance, the merest accident, might result, as it\r\ndid in 1876, in defeating Cornell.\r\n\r\nSo much depended upon the control of the temporary organisation that\r\nthe anti-Conkling forces begged the Vice-President to stand for\r\ntemporary chairman. They could easily unite upon him, and the belief\r\nobtained that he could defeat the Senator. But Wheeler, a mild and\r\namiable gentleman, whose honours had come without personal contests,\r\nwas timid and unyielding.[1642] What the opposition needed was a real\r\nState leader. It had within its ranks brilliant editors,[1643]\r\nexcellent lawyers, and with few exceptions the best speakers in the\r\nparty, but since Fenton lost control of the organisation no man had\r\narisen capable of crossing swords with its great chieftain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1642: \"The only complaint that his friends have ever made of\r\nMr. Wheeler is that his generous nature forbids him, politically, to\r\nfight. Had he been willing to lead in the State convention in 1879, it\r\nwould have had a different result.\"--_Harper's Weekly_, March 26,\r\n1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1643: Among the more influential Republican editors, who\r\nwrote with rare intelligence, representing both factions of the party,\r\nmay be mentioned Charles E. Smith, Albany _Journal_; Carroll E. Smith,\r\nSyracuse _Journal_; Ellis H. Roberts, Utica _Herald_; James N.\r\nMatthews, Buffalo _Express_; S. Newton Dexter North, Albany _Express_;\r\nWhitelaw Reid, New York _Tribune_; John H. Selkreg, Ithaca _Journal_;\r\nJohn M. Francis, Troy _Times_; Beman Brockway, Watertown _Times_;\r\nCharles E.

Fairman, Elmira _Advertiser_;\r\nWilliam Edward Foster, Buffalo _Commercial_; George Dawson, Albany\r\n_Journal_; Lewis J. Jennings, New York _Times_.]\r\n\r\nOf the four pronounced candidates for governor Frank Hiscock of\r\nSyracuse divided the support of the central counties with Theodore M.\r\nPomeroy of Cayuga, while William H. Robertson of Westchester and John\r\nH. Starin of New York claimed whatever delegates Cornell did not\r\ncontrol in the metropolis and its vicinity. Among them and their\r\nlieutenants, however, none could dispute leadership with Conkling and\r\nhis corps of able managers. Starin had pluck and energy, but two terms\r\nin Congress and popularity with the labouring classes, to whom he paid\r\nlarge wages and generously contributed fresh-air enjoyments, summed up\r\nhis strength.[1644] Pomeroy was better known. His public record, dating\r\nfrom the famous speech made in the Whig convention of 1855, had kept\r\nhim prominently before the people, and had he continued in Congress he\r\nmust have made an exalted national reputation. But the day of younger\r\nmen had come. Besides, his recent vote for John F. Smyth, the head of\r\nthe Insurance Department, injured him.[1645] Robertson, as usual, had\r\nstrong support. His long public career left a clear imprint of his\r\nhigh character, and his attractive personality, with its restrained\r\nforce, made him a central figure in the politics of the State.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1644: The sale of a condition powder for cattle started\r\nStarin on the road to wealth, which soon discovered itself in the\r\nownership of canal, river, and harbour boats, until he became known as\r\nHigh Admiral of the Commerce of New York. Like success attended his\r\nrailroad operations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1645: Pomeroy was district-attorney of his County, 1851-56;\r\nin the Assembly, 1857; in Congress, 1861-69, being elected speaker in\r\nplace of Colfax on the day the latter retired to be sworn in as\r\nVice-President; mayor of Auburn, 1875-76; State Senate, 1878-79.]\r\n\r\nHiscock was then on the threshold of his public career. He began life\r\nas the law partner and political lieutenant of his brother, Harris, an\r\nadroit politician, whose violent death in 1867, while a member of the\r\nconstitutional convention, left to the former the Republican\r\nleadership of Onondaga County. If his diversion as a Liberal\r\ntemporarily crippled him, it did not prevent his going to Congress in\r\n1876, where he was destined to remain for sixteen years and to achieve\r\nhigh rank as a debater on financial questions. He was without a sense\r\nof humour and possessed rather an austere manner, but as a highly\r\nsuccessful lawyer he exhibited traits of character that strengthened\r\nhim with the people. He was also an eminently wary and cautious man,\r\nalive to the necessity of watching the changeful phases of public\r\nopinion, and slow to propound a plan until he had satisfied himself\r\nthat it could be carried out in practice. It increased his influence,\r\ntoo, that he was content with a stroke of practical business here and\r\nthere in the interest of party peace without claiming credit for any\r\nbrilliant or deep diplomacy.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful, however, if the genius of a Weed could have induced\r\nthe disorganised forces, representing the four candidates, to put up a\r\nsingle opponent to Cornell. Such a course, in the opinion of the\r\nleaders, would release delegates to the latter without compensating\r\nadvantage. It was decided, therefore, to hold the field intact with\r\nthe hope of preventing a nomination on the first ballot, and to let\r\nthe result determine the next step. In their endeavour to accomplish\r\nthis they stoutly maintained that Cornell, inheriting the unpopularity\r\nof the machine, could not carry the State. To win New York and thus\r\nhave its position defined for 1880 was the one great desire of\r\nRepublicans, and the visible effect of the fusionists' attack,\r\nconcededly made with great tact and cleverness, if without much effort\r\nat organisation, turned Conkling's confidence into doubt. Then he put\r\non more pressure. In the preceding winter Pomeroy's vote and speech\r\nin the State Senate had saved John F. Smyth from deserved impeachment,\r\nand he now counted confidently upon the Commissioner's promised\r\nsupport of his candidacy. But Conkling demanded it for Cornell, and\r\nSmyth left Pomeroy to care for himself.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that a roll-call ever proceeded under such tension.\r\nNominating speeches were abandoned, cheers for the platform faded into\r\nan ominous silence, and every response sounded like the night-step of\r\na watchful sentinel. Only when some conspicuous leader voted was the\r\nstillness broken. A score of men were keeping count, and halfway down\r\nthe roll the fusionists tied their opponents. When, at last, the call\r\nclosed with nine majority for Cornell, the result, save a spasm of\r\nthroat-splitting yells, was received with little enthusiasm.[1646] On\r\nthe motion to make the nomination unanimous George William Curtis\r\nvoted \"No\" distinctly.[1647]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1646: Whole number of votes cast, 450. Necessary to a choice,\r\n226. Cornell received 234; Robertson, 106; Starin, 40; Pomeroy, 35;\r\nHiscock, 34; Sloan, 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1647: _Harper's Weekly_, October 25, 1879.]\r\n\r\nIt was a Conkling victory. For three days delegates had crowded the\r\nSenator's headquarters, while in an inner room he strengthened the\r\nweak, won the doubtful, and directed his forces with remarkable skill.\r\nHe asked no quarter, and after his triumph every candidate selected\r\nfor a State office was an avowed friend of Cornell. \"It would have\r\nbeen poor policy,\" said one of the Senator's lieutenants, \"to\r\napologise for what he had done by seeming to strengthen the ticket\r\nwith open enemies of the chief candidate.\"[1648]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1648: New York _Sun_, September 8.\r\n\r\nThe following candidates were nominated: Governor, Alonzo B. Cornell,\r\nNew York; Lieutenant-Governor, George G. Hoskins, Wyoming; Secretary\r\nof State, Joseph B. Carr, Rensselaer; Comptroller, James W. Wadsworth,\r\nLivingston; Attorney-General, Hamilton Ward, Allegany; Treasurer,\r\nNathan D. Wendell, Albany; Engineer, Howard Soule, Onondaga.]\r\n\r\nThe aftermath multiplied reasons for the coalition's downfall. Some\r\nthought the defeat of Cornell in 1876 deceived the opposition as to\r\nhis strength; others, that a single candidate should have opposed him;\r\nothers, again, that the work of securing delegates did not begin early\r\nenough. But all agreed that the action of George B. Sloan of Oswego\r\nseriously weakened them. Since 1874 Sloan had been prominently\r\nidentified with the unfettered wing of the party. Indeed, his activity\r\nalong lines of reform had placed him at the head and front of\r\neverything that made for civic betterment. In character he resembled\r\nRobertson. His high qualities and flexibility of mind gave him\r\nunrivalled distinction. He possessed a charm which suffused his\r\npersonality as a smile softens and irradiates a face, and although it\r\nwas a winsome rather than a commanding personality, it lacked neither\r\nfirmness nor power. Moreover, he was a resourceful business man, keen,\r\nactive, and honest--characteristics which he carried with him into\r\npublic life. His great popularity made him speaker of the Assembly in\r\nthe third year of his service (1877), and his ability to work\r\ntactfully and effectively had suggested his name to the coalition as a\r\ncompromise candidate for governor. He had never leaned to the side of\r\nthe machine. In fact, his failure to win the speakership in the\r\npreceding January was due to the opposition of Cornell backed by John\r\nF. Smyth, and his hopes of future State preferment centred in the\r\ndefeat of these aggressive men. Yet at the critical moment, when\r\nsuccess seemed within the grasp of his old-time friends, he voted for\r\nCornell. For this his former associates never wholly forgave him. Nor\r\nwas his motive ever fully understood. Various reasons found\r\ncurrency--admiration of Conkling, a desire to harmonise his party at\r\nhome by the nomination of John C. Churchill for State comptroller, and\r\nweariness of opposing an apparently invincible organisation. But\r\nwhatever the motive the coalition hissed when he declared his choice,\r\nand then turned upon Churchill like a pack of sleuth-hounds, defeating\r\nhim upon the first ballot in spite of Conkling's assistance.\r\n\r\nTammany's threat to bolt Robinson's renomination may have encouraged\r\nCornell's nomination, since such truancy would aid his election. John\r\nKelly was _in extremis_. Tammany desertions and the election of Mayor\r\nCooper had shattered his control of the city. To add to his\r\ndiscomfiture the Governor had removed Henry A. Gumbleton, charged with\r\ntaking monstrous fees as clerk of New York County, and appointed\r\nHubert O. Thompson in his place. Gumbleton was Kelly's pet; Thompson\r\nwas Cooper's lieutenant. Although the Governor sufficiently justified\r\nhis action, the exercise of this high executive function was generally\r\nsupposed to be only a move in the great Presidential game of 1880. His\r\nfailure to remove the Register, charged with similar misdoings,\r\nstrengthened the supposition that the Tilden camp fires were burning\r\nbrightly. But whatever the Governor's motive, Kelly accepted\r\nGumbleton's removal as an open declaration of war, and on September 6\r\n(1879), five days before the Democratic State convention, Tammany's\r\ncommittee on organisation secretly declared \"that in case the\r\nconvention insists upon the renomination of Lucius Robinson for\r\ngovernor, the Tammany delegation will leave in a body.\"[1649] In\r\npreparation for this event an agent of Tammany hired Shakespeare Hall,\r\nthe only room left in Syracuse of sufficient size to accommodate a\r\nbolting convention.[1650]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1649: New York _Star_, Sept. 17, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1650: New York _Sun_, Sept. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe changes visible in the alignment of factions since the Democrats\r\nhad selected a candidate for governor in Syracuse reflected the fierce\r\nstruggle waged in the intervening five years. In 1874 Tweed was in\r\njail; Kelly, standing for Tilden, assailed Sanford E. Church as a\r\nfriend of the canal ring; Dorsheimer, thrust into the Democratic party\r\nthrough the Greeley revolt, was harvesting honour in high office;\r\nBigelow, dominated by his admiration of a public servant who concealed\r\nan unbridled ambition, gave character to the so-called reform; and\r\nCharles S. Fairchild, soon to appreciate the ingratitude of party, was\r\nbuilding a reputation as the undismayed prosecutor of a predatory\r\nring. Now, Tweed was in his grave; Kelly had joined the canal ring in\r\nsounding the praises of Church; Dorsheimer, having drifted into\r\nTammany and the editorship of the _Star_, disparaged the man whom he\r\nadored as governor and sought to make President; and Bigelow and\r\nFairchild, their eyes opened, perhaps, by cipher telegrams, found\r\nsatisfaction in the practice of their professions.\r\n\r\nBut Tilden was not without friends. If some had left him, others had\r\ngrown more potent. For several years Daniel E. Manning, known to his\r\nAlbany neighbours as a youth of promise and a young man of ripening\r\nwisdom, had attracted attention by his genius for political\r\nleadership.[1651] He seems never to have been rash or misled. Even an\r\nexuberance of animal vitality that eagerly sought new outlets for its\r\nenergy did not waste itself in aimless experiments. Although\r\npossessing the generosity of a rich nature, he preferred to work\r\nwithin lines of purpose without heady enthusiasms or reckless\r\nextremes, and his remarkable gifts as an executive, coupled with the\r\nstudy of politics as a fine art, soon made him a manager of men. This\r\nwas demonstrated in his aggressive fight against Tweedism. Manning was\r\nnow (1879) forty-eight years old. It cannot be said that he had then\r\nreached the place filled by Dean Richmond, or that the _Argus_ wielded\r\nthe power exerted in the days of Edwin Croswell; but the anti-ring\r\nforces in the interior of the State cheerfully mustered under his\r\nleadership, while the _Argus_, made forceful and attractive by the\r\nsingularly brilliant and facile pen of St. Clair McKelway, swayed the\r\nminds of its readers to a degree almost unequalled among its party\r\ncontemporaries.[1652]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1651: In the early forties Manning began as an office-boy on\r\nthe Albany _Atlas_, and in 1865, as associate editor of the _Argus_,\r\nhe dominated its policy. Upon the death of James Cassidy, in 1873, he\r\nsucceeded to the presidency of the company with which he continued\r\nthroughout his life.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1652: After service on the New York _World_, and the Brooklyn\r\n_Eagle_, McKelway became chief editor of the _Argus_ in 1878. He\r\nrejoined the _Eagle_ in 1885. Among other accomplished editors who\r\nmade their journals conspicuous in party (Democratic) and State from\r\n1865 to 1880, may be mentioned William Cassidy, Albany _Argus_; Thomas\r\nKinsella, Brooklyn _Eagle_; Joseph Warren and David Gray, Buffalo\r\n_Courier_; Samuel M. Shaw, Cooperstown _Freeman's Journal_; James and\r\nErastus Brooks, New York _Express_; Benjamin Wood, New York _News_;\r\nManton Marble and Joseph Pulitzer, New York _World_; William Purcell,\r\nRochester _Union-Advertiser_; Henry A. Reeves, Greenport _Republican\r\nWatchman_; E. Prentiss Bailey, Utica _Observer_. Although previously\r\nof Democratic tendencies, the New York _Herald_, by 1865, had become\r\nwholly independent.]\r\n\r\nManning took charge of the interests of Robinson, who did not attend\r\nthe convention, receiving Kelly's tactful and spirited assault with\r\nfine courage. The Governor's enemies were more specific than\r\nCornell's. They predicted that Robinson's renomination would lose\r\ntwenty thousand votes in New York City alone, and an ingenious and\r\nextensively circulated table showed that the counties represented by\r\nhis delegates had recently exhibited a Democratic loss of thirty\r\nthousand and an increased Republican vote of forty thousand, while\r\nlocalities opposed to him revealed encouraging gains. Mindful of the\r\nhavoc wrought in 1874 by connecting Church with the canal ring, Kelly\r\nalso sought to crush Robinson by charging that corporate rings,\r\nnotably the New York Mutual Life Insurance Company, had controlled his\r\nadministration, and that although he had resigned from the Erie\r\ndirectorate at the time of his election, he still received large fees\r\nthrough his son who acted as attorney for the road. Moreover, Kelly\r\nintimated, with a dark frown, that he had another stone in his sling.\r\nThis onslaught, made upon every country delegate in town, seemed to\r\nconfuse if not to shake the Tilden men, whose interest centred in\r\nsuccess as well as in Robinson. The hesitation of the Kings County\r\ndelegation, under the leadership of Hugh McLaughlin, to declare\r\npromptly for the Governor, and the toying of Senator Kernan with the\r\nname of Church while talking in the interest of harmony, indicated\r\nirresolution. Even David B. Hill and Edward K. Apgar, who desired to\r\nshape affairs for a pledged delegation to the next national\r\nconvention, evidenced weariness.\r\n\r\nManning steadied the line. In proclaiming Robinson's nomination on the\r\nfirst ballot he anticipated every movement of the enemy. He knew that\r\nHenry W. Slocum's candidacy did not appeal to McLaughlin; that Chief\r\nJustice Church's consent rested upon an impossible condition; and that\r\nKelly's threatened bolt, however disastrously it might end in\r\nNovember, would strengthen Robinson in the convention. Nevertheless,\r\nunusual concessions showed a desire to proceed on lines of harmony.\r\nTammany's delegation was seated with the consent of Irving Hall; John\r\nC. Jacobs, a senator from Brooklyn, was made chairman; the fairness of\r\ncommittee appointments allayed suspicion; a platform accepted by if\r\nnot inoffensive to all Democrats set forth the principles of the\r\nparty,[1653] and an avoidance of irritating statements characterised\r\nthe speeches placing Robinson's name in nomination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1653: The platform, which dealt mainly with State issues,\r\nrepeated the fraud-cry of 1876, advocated hard money, and upheld the\r\nDemocratic programme in Congress.--See Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1879,\r\np. 680.]\r\n\r\nTammany's part was less cleverly played. Its effort centred in\r\nbreaking the solid Brooklyn delegation, and although with much tact it\r\npresented Slocum as its candidate for governor, and cunningly\r\nexpressed confidence in Jacobs by proposing that he select the\r\nCommittee on Credentials, two Bowery orators, with a fierceness born\r\nof hate, abused Robinson and pronounced Tilden \"the biggest fraud of\r\nthe age.\"[1654] Then Dorsheimer took the floor. His purpose was to\r\ncapture the Kings and Albany delegations, and walking down the aisles\r\nwith stage strides he begged them, in a most impassioned manner, to\r\nput themselves in Tammany's place, and to say whether, under like\r\ncircumstances, they would not adopt the same course. He did it very\r\nadroitly. His eyes blazed, his choice words blended entreaty with\r\nreasoning, and his manner indicated an earnestness that captivated if\r\nit did not convert. His declaration, however, that Tammany would bolt\r\nRobinson's renomination withered the effect of his rhetoric. Kelly had\r\ninsinuated as much, and Tammany had flouted it for two days; but\r\nDorsheimer's announcement was the first authoritative declaration, and\r\nit hardened the hearts of men who repudiated such methods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1654: See New York papers of September 12, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThen the tricksters had their inning. Pending a motion that a\r\ncommittee of one from each county be appointed to secure harmony, a\r\nSaratoga delegate moved that John C. Jacobs be nominated for governor\r\nby acclamation. This turned the convention into a pandemonium. In the\r\nmidst of the whirlwind of noise a Tammany reading clerk, putting the\r\nmotion, declared it carried. Similar tactics had won Horatio Seymour\r\nthe nomination for President in 1868, and for a time it looked as if\r\nthe Chair might profit by their repetition. Jacobs was a young man.\r\nAmbition possessed and high office attracted him. But if a vision of\r\nthe governorship momentarily unsettled his mind, one glance at\r\nMcLaughlin and the Brooklyn delegation, sitting like icebergs in the\r\nmidst of the heated uproar, restored his reason. When a motion to\r\nrecess increased the tumult, Rufus H. Peckham, a cool Tilden man,\r\ncalled for the ayes and noes. This brought the convention to earth\r\nagain, and as the noise subsided Jacobs reproved the clerk for his\r\nunauthorised assumption of the Chair's duties, adding, with a slight\r\nshow of resentment, that had he been consulted respecting the\r\nnomination he should have respectfully declined.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the roll-call the Tammany tellers, adding the\r\naggregate vote to suit the needs of the occasion, pronounced the\r\nmotion carried, while others declared it lost. A second call defeated\r\na recess by 166 to 217. On a motion to table the appointment of a\r\nharmony committee the vote stood 226 to 155. A motion to adjourn also\r\nfailed by 166 to 210. These results indicated that neither tricks nor\r\ndisorder could shake the Robinson phalanx, and after the call to\r\nselect a nominee for governor had begun, Augustus Schell, John Kelly,\r\nWilliam Dorsheimer, and other Tammany leaders rose in their places.\r\n\"Under no circumstances will the Democracy of New York support the\r\nnomination of Lucius Robinson,\" said Schell; \"but the rest of the\r\nticket will receive its warm and hearty support.\" Then he paused.\r\nKelly, standing in the background of the little group, seemed to\r\nshrink from the next step. Regularity was the touchstone of Tammany's\r\ncreed. Indifference to ways and means gave no offence, but\r\ndisobedience to the will of a caucus or convention admitted of no\r\nforgiveness. Would Kelly himself be the first to commit this\r\nunpardonable sin? He could invoke no precedent to shield him. In 1847\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso struck the keynote of popular sentiment, and the\r\nBarnburners, leaving the convention the instant the friends of the\r\nSouth repudiated the principle, sought to stay the aggressiveness of\r\nslavery. Nor could he appeal to party action in 1853, for the Hunkers\r\nrefused to enter the convention after the Barnburners had organised\r\nit. Moreover, he was wholly without excuse. He had accepted the\r\nplatform, participated in all proceedings, and exhausted argument,\r\ndiplomacy, trickery, and deception. Not until certain defeat faced him\r\ndid he rise to go, and even then he tarried with the hope that\r\nSchell's words would bring the olive-branch. It was a moment of\r\nintense suspense. The convention, sitting in silence, realised that\r\nthe loss meant probable defeat, and anxious men, unwilling to take\r\nchances, looked longingly from one leader to another. But the symbol\r\nof peace did not appear, and Schell announced, as he led the way to\r\nthe door: \"The delegation from New York will now retire from the\r\nhall.\" Then cheers and hisses deadened the tramp of retreating\r\nfootsteps.\r\n\r\nAfter the bolters' departure Irving Hall took the seats of Tammany,\r\nand the convention quickly closed its work. The roll-call showed 301\r\nvotes cast, of which Robinson received 243 and Slocum 56. Little\r\nconflict occurred in the selection of other names on the ticket, all\r\nthe candidates save the lieutenant-governor being renominated.[1655]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1655: The ticket presented was as follows: Governor, Lucius\r\nRobinson, Chemung; Lieutenant-Governor, Clarkson N. Potter, New York;\r\nSecretary of State, Allen C. Beach, Jefferson; Comptroller, Frederick\r\nP. Olcott, New York; Treasurer, James Mackin, Dutchess;\r\nAttorney-General, Augustus Schoonmaker, Ulster; State Engineer,\r\nHoratio Seymour, Jr., Oneida.]\r\n\r\nIn the evening Tammany occupied Shakespeare Hall. David Dudley Field,\r\nformerly a zealous anti-slavery Republican, and more recently Tilden's\r\ncounsel before the Electoral Commission, presided; Dorsheimer, whose\r\ngrotesque position must have appealed to his own keen sense of the\r\nhumorous, moved the nomination of John Kelly for governor; and Kelly,\r\nin his speech of acceptance, prophesied the defeat of Governor\r\nRobinson. This done they went out into darkness.\r\n\r\nThroughout the campaign the staple of Republican exhortations was the\r\nSouthern question and the need of a \"strong man.\" Even Conkling in his\r\none speech made no reference to State politics or State affairs. When\r\nCornell's election, midway in the canvass, seemed assured, Curtis\r\nargued that his success would defeat the party in 1880, and to avoid\r\nsuch a calamity he advocated \"scratching the ticket.\"[1656] Several\r\nwell-known Republicans, adopting the suggestion, published an address,\r\ngiving reasons for their refusal to support the head and the tail of\r\nthe ticket. They cited the cause of Cornell's dismissal from the\r\ncustom-house; compared the cost of custom-house administration before\r\nand after his separation from the service; and made unpleasant\r\nreference to the complicity of Soule in the canal frauds, as revealed\r\nin the eleventh report of the Canal Investigating Committee.[1657]\r\nImmediately the signers were dubbed \"Scratchers.\" The party press\r\nstigmatised them as traitors, and several journals refused to publish\r\ntheir address even as an advertisement. So bitterly was Curtis\r\nassailed that he thought it necessary to resign the chairmanship of\r\nthe Richmond County convention. Party wits also ridiculed him. Henry\r\nWard Beecher said, with irresistible humour, that scratching is good\r\nfor cutaneous affections. Martin I. Townsend declared that no\r\nRepublican lived in Troy who had any disease that required scratching.\r\nEvarts called it \"voting in the air.\" To all this Curtis replied that\r\nthe incessant fusillade proved his suggestion not so utterly\r\ncontemptible as it was alleged to be. \"If the thing be a mosquito,\r\nthere is too much powder and ball wasted upon it.\"[1658]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1656: _Harper's Weekly_, October 4, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1657: New York papers, October 10, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1658: _Harper's Weekly_, November 8, 1879.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the speech of the Secretary of State cut deeply. Evarts\r\nrepresented an Administration which had removed Cornell that \"the\r\noffice may be properly and efficiently administered.\" Now, he endorsed\r\nhim for governor, ridiculed Republicans that opposed him, and pointed\r\nunmistakably to Grant as the \"strong man\" who could best maintain the\r\npower of the people.[1659] The _Nation_ spoke of Evarts' appearance as\r\n\"indecent.\"[1660] Curtis was not less severe. \"Both his appearance and\r\nhis speech are excellent illustrations of the reason why the political\r\ninfluence of so able and excellent a man is so slight. Mr. Evarts,\r\nmusing on the folly of voting in the air, may remember the arrow of\r\nwhich the poet sings, which was shot into the air and found in the\r\nheart of an oak. It is hearts of oak, not of bending reeds, that make\r\nand save parties.\"[1661]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1659: Cooper Union speech, October 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1660: October 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1661: _Harper's Weekly_, November 8.]\r\n\r\nTalk of a secret alliance between Tammany and the Cornell managers\r\nbegan very early in the campaign. Perhaps the fulsome praise of John\r\nKelly in Republican journals, the constant support of John F. Smyth by\r\nTammany senators, and Kelly's avowed intention to defeat Robinson,\r\nwere sufficient to arouse suspicion. Conkling's sudden silence as to\r\nthe danger threatening free elections, of which he declaimed so warmly\r\nin April, seemed to indicate undue satisfaction with existing\r\nconditions. To several newspapers the action of two Republican police\r\ncommissioners, who championed Tammany's right to its share of poll\r\ninspectors, pointed unmistakably to a bargain, since it gave Tammany\r\nand the Republicans power to select a chairman at each poll.[1662]\r\nEvidence of a real alliance, however, was nebulous. The defeat of\r\nRobinson meant the election of Cornell, and Republicans naturally\r\nwelcomed any effort to accomplish it. They greeted Kelly, during his\r\ntour of the State, with noise and music, crowded his meetings, and\r\notherwise sought to dishearten Robinson's friends. Although Kelly's\r\nspeeches did not compare in piquancy with his printed words, his\r\nreferences to Tilden as the \"old humbug of Cipher Alley\" and to\r\nRobinson as having \"sore eyes\" when signing bills, kept his hearers\r\nexpectant and his enemies disturbed. The _World_ followed him,\r\nreporting his speeches as \"failures\" and his audiences as \"rushing\r\npell-mell from the building.\"[1663]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1662: The _Nation_, September 25 and October 23, 1879; New\r\nYork _Times_, September 19, 20, 24, 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1663: New York _World_, October 11, 14, 16, 17.\r\n\r\n    \"John Kelly. Oh! John Kelly!\r\n      We read you like a book;\r\n    We've got plain country common-sense,\r\n      Though homely we may look;\r\n    And we know each vote you beg, John,\r\n      Is only begged to sell;\r\n    You are but the tool of Conkling,\r\n      And bargained to Cornell.\"\r\n        --New York _World_, October 17.]\r\n\r\nKelly did not mean to dish the whole Democratic ticket. He expected to\r\nelect the minor State officers. But he learned on the morning after\r\nelection that he had entirely miscalculated the effect of his scheme,\r\nsince every Democrat except the nephew of Horatio Seymour rested in\r\nthe party morgue by the side of Lucius Robinson.[1664] In the city\r\nKelly also disappointed his followers. His own vote ran behind\r\nRobinson's, and all his friends were slaughtered. Indeed, when Tammany\r\nsurrendered its regularity at Syracuse it lost its voting strength.\r\nEven Cornell whom it saved ran 20,000 behind his ticket. The election\r\nwas, in fact, a triumph for nobody except Conkling. He had put into\r\nthe highest State office a personal adherent, whom the Administration\r\nhad stigmatised by dismissal; he had brought to New York his principal\r\nopponents in the Cabinet (Evarts and Sherman) to speak for his nominee\r\nand their dismissed servant; and he had induced the Administration to\r\ncall for a \"strong man\" for the Presidency.[1665]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1664: The election held on November 4, resulted as follows:\r\nGovernor, Cornell, 418,567; Robinson, 375,790; Kelly, 77,566; Lewis\r\n(National), 20,286; Mears (Prohibition), 4,437.

We cannot do this if our friends defeat a\r\nRepublican candidate for governor, fairly nominated, and against whom\r\nthere are no substantial charges affecting his integrity.\"--Burton,\r\n_Life of Sherman_, p. 296.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nSTALWART AND HALF-BREED\r\n\r\n1880\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile General Grant made his tour around the world there was much\r\nspeculation respecting his renomination for the Presidency. Very\r\ncautiously started on the ground of necessity because of the attitude\r\nof the Southerners in Congress, the third-term idea continued to\r\nstrengthen until the widespread and deep interest in the great\r\nsoldier's home-coming was used to create the belief that he was\r\nunmistakably the popular choice. Grant himself had said nothing\r\npublicly upon the subject except in China, and his proper and modest\r\nallusions to it then added to the people's respect. But during the\r\nwelcome extended him at Philadelphia, the Mayor of that city disclosed\r\na well-laid plan to make him a candidate. This frank declaration\r\nindicated also that Grant expected the nomination, if, indeed, he was\r\nnot a party to the scheme for securing it.\r\n\r\nThe question of discrediting the traditions quickly became a serious\r\none, and its discussion, stimulated by other aspirants for the\r\nPresidency, took a wide range. The opponents of a third term did not\r\nyield to any in their grateful remembrance and recognition of what\r\nGrant had done for the country, but they deemed it impolitic upon both\r\npublic and party grounds. If the tradition of two terms be overthrown\r\nbecause of his distinguished service, they argued, his election for a\r\nfourth term, to which the Constitution offered no bar, could be urged\r\nfor the same reason with still more cogency. Such apparently logical\r\naction would not only necessarily familiarise the public mind, already\r\ndisturbed by the increasing depression to business caused by the\r\nturmoil incident to quadrennial elections, with the idea of a\r\nperpetual Presidency, but it would foster confidence in personal\r\ngovernment, and encourage the feeling that approved experience, as in\r\nthe case of trusted legislators, is necessary to the continuance of\r\nwise administration.\r\n\r\nParty reasons also furnished effective opposition. German voters,\r\nespecially in New York and Wisconsin, early disclosed an indisposition\r\nto accept Grant even if nominated, while the Independent or Scratcher\r\nvoiced a greater hostility than the Cornell nomination had excited.\r\nNever before had so much attention been given to a political question\r\nby persons ordinarily indifferent to such speculation. Anti-Grant\r\nclubs, springing up in a night, joined the press in ridiculing the\r\npersistent talk about the need of \"a strong man,\" and charged that the\r\nscheme was conceived by a coterie of United States senators, managed\r\nby former office-holders under President Grant, and supported by men\r\nwho regarded the Hayes administration as an impertinence. Matthew\r\nHale, in accepting the presidency of the Albany Club, declared the\r\nmovement to be at war with American traditions and with the spirit of\r\nAmerican institutions.[1666]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1666: The Albany Club was organised early in January, 1880.]\r\n\r\nSuch acrimonious antagonism quickly uncovered the purpose of the\r\nStalwarts, who now sought to control the nomination regardless of\r\nopposition. For this purpose unusually early conventions for the\r\nselection of delegates to the National Convention, to be held at\r\nChicago on June 2, were called in Pennsylvania, New York, and other\r\nStates. Pennsylvania's was fixed for February 4 at Harrisburg, and New\r\nYork's for the 25th at Utica. Like methods obtained in the selection\r\nof delegates. At Albany John F. Smyth issued a call in the evening for\r\nprimaries to be held the next day at noon, and furnished his followers\r\nwith pink coloured tickets, headed \"Grant.\" Smyth was already in bad\r\nodour. Governor Robinson had accused him of compelling illegal\r\npayments by insurance companies of a large sum of money, to which he\r\nreplied that the act making it illegal was unconstitutional, although\r\nno court had so pronounced. His misdemeanour was confirmed in the\r\npublic mind by the fact, elicited on the impeachment trial, that the\r\nmoney so obtained had been divided among agents of the Republican\r\norganisation. Indeed, the _Times_ charged, without reservation, that\r\nin one case the place of division was in none other than the house of\r\nCornell himself.[1667] Although the Senate of 1878 and of 1879 failed\r\nto remove Smyth, the Senate of 1880, notwithstanding his reappointment\r\nby Governor Cornell, refused to confirm him.[1668] In the presence of\r\nsuch a sorry record the ostracised Albany Republicans were not\r\nsurprised at his attempt to cheat them at the primaries, and their\r\nindignation at the shameless procedure resounded through the State. At\r\nthe end of a week Charles Emory Smith, the gifted editor of the Albany\r\n_Journal_, who headed the delegation thus selected, deemed it\r\nexpedient to withdraw. Five associates did likewise. Nevertheless, the\r\nopponents of a third term refused to participate in a second election,\r\ncalled to fill the vacancies, since it did not remove the taint from\r\nthe majority who refused to resign.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1667: New York _Times_ (editorial), February 18, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1668: \"The Governor showed his contempt for public opinion by\r\nnominating John F. Smyth, while the Senate had self-respect enough to\r\nrefrain from confirming him.\"--_Ibid._, May 28, 1880.]\r\n\r\nIn reward for his defence of Smyth, if not to express contempt for the\r\nAlbany malcontents, Charles Emory Smith was made chairman of the Utica\r\nconvention. This evidenced Conkling's complete control. Smith had\r\nlived in Albany since early boyhood. He passed from its Academy to\r\nUnion College, thence back to the Academy as a teacher, and from that\r\nposition to the editorship of the _Express_. In a few years his clear,\r\nincisive English, always forcible, often eloquent, had advanced him to\r\nthe editorship of the _Evening Journal_. Singularly attractive in\r\nperson, with slender, agile form, sparkling eyes, and ruddy cheeks,\r\nhe adorned whatever place he held. Indeed, the beauty and strength of\r\nhis character, coupled with the esteem in which Republican leaders\r\nheld him as a counsellor, gave him in the seventies a position in the\r\npolitics of the State somewhat akin to that held by Henry J. Raymond\r\nin the sixties. He did not then, if ever, belong in Raymond's class as\r\na journalist or as an orator. Nor did he possess the vehement desire\r\nfor office that distinguished the brilliant editor of the _Times_. But\r\nSmith's admirable temper, his sweet disposition, and his rare faculty\r\nfor saying things without offence, kept him, like Raymond, on friendly\r\nterms with all. His part was not always an easy one. Leaders changed\r\nand new issues appeared, yet his pen, though sometimes crafty, was\r\nnever dipped in gall. While acting as secretary for Governor Fenton he\r\nenjoyed the esteem of Edwin D. Morgan, and if his change from the\r\nAlbany _Express_ to the Albany _Journal_ in 1870, and from the\r\n_Journal_ to the Philadelphia _Press_ in 1880, carried him from\r\nFenton's confidence into Conkling's embrace and converted him from an\r\nardent third-termer to a champion of Blaine, the bad impression of\r\nthis prestidigitation was relieved, if not excused or forgotten,\r\nbecause of his journalistic promotion.\r\n\r\nIn State conventions, too, Smith played the part formerly assigned to\r\nRaymond, becoming by common consent chairman of the Committee on\r\nResolutions. His ear went instinctively to the ground, and, aided by\r\nCarroll E. Smith of the Syracuse _Journal_, he wrote civil service\r\nreform into the platform of 1877, the principle of sound money into\r\nthat of 1878, and carefully shaded important parts of other platforms\r\nin that eventful decade.[1669] In like manner, although a pronounced\r\nchampion of Conkling and the politics he represented, Smith encouraged\r\nmoderate policies, urged frank recognition of the just claims of the\r\nminority, and sought to prevent the stalwart managers from too widely\r\nbreaching the proprieties that should govern political organisations.\r\nIf his efforts proved unavailing, it seemed that he had at least\r\nmastered the art of being regular without being bigoted, and of living\r\non good terms with a machine whose methods he could not wholly\r\napprove. Nevertheless, there came a time when his associations, as in\r\nthe career of Raymond, seriously injured him, since his toleration and\r\nardent defence of John F. Smyth, besides grieving sincere friends and\r\ntemporarily clouding his young life,[1670] dissolved his relations with\r\na journal that he loved, and which, under his direction, had reminded\r\nits readers of the forceful days of Thurlow Weed. Fortunately, the\r\noffer of the editorship of the Philadelphia _Press_, coming\r\ncontemporaneously with his separation from the Albany _Journal_, gave\r\nhim an honourable exit from New York, and opened not only a larger\r\nsphere of action but a more distinguished career.[1671]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1669: \"Mr. Smith is one of the happily diminishing class of\r\namphibious editors, one-third journalist, two-thirds 'worker,' who\r\nconsult with the Bosses in hotels all over the State about 'fixing\r\nthings,' draw fustian platforms for State conventions, embody the Boss\r\nview of the nation and the world in 'editorials,' and supply the pure\r\nmilk of the word to local committees and henchmen, and 'make it hot'\r\nfor the Democrats during the canvass.\"--The _Nation_, March 4, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1670: Smith was then thirty-eight years of age.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1671: \"Mr. Smith's partners in the _Journal_ had become\r\nenraged in the course of a factional controversy over public\r\nappointments, in particular that of Smyth to be the Insurance\r\nCommissioner. At a conference Mr. Smith's partners desired to get\r\neditorial control at once and to terminate his connection with the\r\n_Journal_.\"--Philadelphia _Press_, January 20, 1908.\r\n\r\n\"The first response of the conscience and courage of the party was the\r\nprompt change of the Albany _Evening Journal_, probably the most\r\ninfluential party paper in the State, from the position of a\r\nthick-and-thin machine organ to that of an advocate of sound and\r\nindependent Republicanism.\"--_Harper's Weekly_, March 13, 1880.]\r\n\r\nHaving control of the convention Conkling boldly demanded the adoption\r\nof a resolution instructing \"the delegates to use their most earnest\r\nand united efforts to secure the nomination of Ulysses S. Grant.\" The\r\nadmirers of Blaine seemed unprepared for such a contest. The meagre\r\nmajority given Grant at the Pennsylvania convention had greatly\r\nencouraged them, but the intervening three weeks afforded insufficient\r\ntime to gather their strength. Besides, no one then suspected the\r\noverwhelming public sentiment against a third term which was soon to\r\nsweep the country. As it was no one seemed to have definite plans or a\r\nprecise knowledge of how to proceed or what to do, while local leaders\r\nfrittered away their strength in petty quarrels which had little\r\nbearing upon the question of Presidential candidates. Finally, an\r\namendment simply endorsing the nominee of the Chicago convention was\r\noffered as a substitute for the Grant resolution.\r\n\r\nThe Stalwarts, with the steadiness of veterans conscious of their\r\nstrength, deftly, almost delicately, in fact, silenced the minority.\r\nOnly once, when the reader of the resolutions hesitated over an\r\nillegible word, did the dramatic happen. At that moment a thin voice\r\nin the gallery exclaimed, \"Hurrah for Blaine!\" Instantly the audience\r\nwas on fire. The burst of applause brought out by Smith's opening\r\nreference to the \"never vanquished hero of Appomattox\" had been\r\ndisappointing because it lacked spontaneity and enthusiasm, but the\r\nsound of the magic word \"Blaine,\" like a spark flying to powder, threw\r\nthe galleries into a flame of cheering which was obstinate in dying\r\nout. Conkling, in closing the debate on the resolution, showed his\r\ncustomary audacity by hurling bitter sarcasm at the people who had\r\npresumed to applaud. It was in this address that he recited Raleigh's\r\nfamous line from _The Silent Lover_: \"The shallows murmur but the\r\ndeeps are dumb.\"[1672]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1672:\r\n\r\n    \"Passions are likened best to flowers and streams;\r\n    The shallows murmur but the deeps are dumb.\"\r\n      --_Works of Sir Walter Raleigh_, Vol. 8, p. 716 (Oxford, 1829).]\r\n\r\nConkling's purpose was to put district delegates upon their honour to\r\nobey the convention's instructions regardless of the preference of\r\ntheir districts. He did it very adroitly, arguing that a delegate is\r\nan agent with a principal behind him, whom he represents if he is\r\nfaithful. \"For what is this convention held?\" he asked. \"Is it merely\r\nto listen while the delegates from the several congressional districts\r\ninform the convention who the districts are going to send to the\r\nnational convention? Is it for that five hundred men, the selected\r\npride of the Republican party of this State, have come here to meet\r\ntogether? I think not. Common sense and the immemorial usages of both\r\nparties answer the question. What is the use of a delegate? Is it a\r\nman to go to a convention representing others, and then determine as\r\nhe individually prefers what he will do? Let me say frankly that if\r\nany man, however much I respect him, were presented to this convention\r\nwho would prove recreant to its judgment, I would never vote for him\r\nas a delegate to any convention.\"[1673]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1673: New York _Tribune_, February 26, 1880.]\r\n\r\nEarlier in the day Newton M. Curtis of St. Lawrence, the one-eyed hero\r\nof Fort Fisher, had insisted with much vehemence that district\r\ndelegates represented the views of their immediate constituents and\r\nnot those of the State convention. Others as stoutly maintained the\r\nsame doctrine. But after Conkling had concluded no one ventured to\r\nrepeat the claim.[1674] Indeed, when the several districts reported\r\ntheir delegates, the Stalwarts openly called upon the suspected ones\r\nto say whether they submitted to the instructions. Woodin and Curtis\r\nvoluntarily surrendered. Thus the Grant forces accomplished by\r\nindirection what prudence deterred them from doing boldly and with a\r\nstrong hand.[1675]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1674: The vote on the resolution endorsing Grant, stood 216\r\nto 183.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1675: Roscoe Conkling, Alonzo B. Cornell, Chester A. Arthur,\r\nand James D. Warren, were selected as delegates-at-large.]\r\n\r\nWhat the managers gained by indirection, however, they lost in\r\nprestige. If the Harrisburg convention punctured the assumption that\r\nthe people demanded Grant's nomination, the Utica assembly destroyed\r\nit, since the majority of thirty-three indicated an entire absence of\r\nspontaneity. Moreover, the convention had scarcely adjourned before\r\nits work became a target. George William Curtis declared the\r\nassertion \"audacious\" and \"ridiculous\" that a district delegate was an\r\nagent of the State convention, claiming that when the latter\r\nrelinquished the right to select it abandoned the right to instruct.\r\nFurthermore, the National Convention, the highest tribunal of the\r\nparty, had decided, he said, that State instructions did not bind\r\ndistrict delegates.[1676] The _Tribune_, voicing the sentiment of the\r\nmajor part of the Republican press, thought the convention had clearly\r\nexceeded its power. \"It was the right of the majority to instruct the\r\ndelegates-at-large,\" it said, \"but it had no right to compel district\r\ndelegates to vote against their consciences and the known wishes of\r\ntheir constituents.\" This led to the more important question whether\r\ndelegates, pledged without authority, ought to observe such\r\ninstructions. \"No man chosen to represent a Blaine district can vote\r\nfor Grant and plead the convention's resolution in justification of\r\nhis course,\" continued the _Tribune_, which closed with serving notice\r\nupon delegates to correct their error as speedily as possible, \"since\r\na delegate who disobeys the instructions of his constituents will find\r\nhimself instantly retired from public life.\"[1677]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1676: _Harper's Weekly_, March 13, 20, April 3, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1677: New York _Tribune_, February 26.]\r\n\r\nAs the campaign waxed warmer and the success of Grant seemed more\r\ncertain if Pennsylvania and New York voted under the unit rule, the\r\npressure to create a break in those States steadily increased. The\r\nStalwarts rested their case upon the regularity of the procedure and\r\nthe delegates' acceptance of the instructions after their election.\r\n\"They accepted both commissions and instructions,\" said the _Times_,\r\n\"with every protestation that they were bound by their sacred honour\r\nto obey the voice of the people as expressed by the traditional and\r\naccepted methods.\"[1678] On the other hand, the Blaine delegates relied\r\nupon the decision of the last National Convention, which held that\r\nwhere a State convention had instructed its delegation to vote as a\r\nunit, each delegate had the right to vote for his individual\r\npreference. \"My selection as a delegate,\" said Woodin, \"was the act of\r\nthe delegates representing my congressional district, and the State\r\nconvention has ratified and certified that act to the National\r\nConvention. Our commissions secure the right to act, and our\r\nconventions guarantee freedom of choice without restraint or\r\nfetters.\"[1679]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1678: New York _Times_, May 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1679: From speech made in the Senate on May 7.--New York\r\n_Tribune_, May 8.]\r\n\r\nWoodin was the most courageous if not the ablest opponent of Conkling\r\nin the convention. He may not have been an organiser of the machine\r\ntype, but he was a born ruler of men. Robust, alert, florid, with\r\nsquare forehead, heavy brows, and keen blue eyes, he looked determined\r\nand fearless. His courage, however, was not the rashness of an\r\nimpetuous nature. It was rather the proud self-confidence of a rugged\r\ncharacter which obstacles roused to a higher combative energy. He was\r\nnot eloquent; not even ornate in diction. But his voice, his words,\r\nand his delivery were all adequate. Besides, he possessed the\r\nincomparable gift of reserved power. During his career of ten years in\r\nthe State Senate he was unquestionably the strongest man in the\r\nLegislature and the designated as well as the real leader for more\r\nthan half a decade. He was not intolerant, seldom disclosing his\r\npowers of sarcasm, or being betrayed, even when excited, into angry or\r\nbitter words. Yet he was extremely resolute and tenacious, and must\r\nhave been the undisputed leader of the anti-Conkling forces save for\r\nthe pitch that many said defiled him. If he yielded it was not proven.\r\nNevertheless, it tended to mildew his influence.\r\n\r\nIt was evident from the speech of Woodin that the anti-Grant forces\r\nhad the reasonableness of the argument, but the acceptance of the\r\nUtica instructions put delegates in a delicate position. To say that\r\nConkling had \"tricked\" them into a pledge which the convention had no\r\nauthority to exact,[1680] did not explain how a personal pledge could\r\nbe avoided. Finally, William H. Robertson, a delegate from the\r\nTwelfth District, who had not appeared at Utica, published a letter\r\nthat he should vote for Blaine \"because he is the choice of the\r\nRepublicans of the district which I represent.\"[1681] Two days\r\nafterwards John Birdsall of the First District and Loren B. Sessions\r\nof the Thirty-third announced on the floor of the Senate that they\r\nshould do likewise. Woodin said that as he could not reconcile a vote\r\nfor some candidate other than Grant with his attitude voluntarily\r\ntaken at Utica he should let his alternate go to Chicago.[1682] From\r\ntime to time other delegates followed with declarations similar to\r\nRobertson's.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1680: _Harper's Weekly_, May 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1681: Letter dated May 6.--See Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1880,\r\np. 575.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1682: New York _Tribune_, May 8.]\r\n\r\nAs expected, this disobedience drew a volley of anathemas upon the\r\noffending delegates, who became known as \"Half-breeds.\"[1683] The\r\n_Times_ thought Robertson's \"tardy revolt\" dictated by \"self-interest,\"\r\nbecause \"the pliant politician from Westchester had chafed under a\r\nsense of disappointed ambition ever since the defeat of his nomination\r\nfor governor in 1872.\"[1684]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1683: Everit Brown, _A Dictionary of American Politics_, p.\r\n372; _Harper's Weekly_, February 5, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1684: New York _Times_, May 16.]\r\n\r\nUpon Sessions and Woodin it was more severe. \"We have never regarded\r\nState Senator Sessions as a type of all that is corrupt in politics at\r\nAlbany,\" it said, \"and we have steadily defended Mr. Woodin against\r\nthe attacks made upon him on the testimony of Tweed. But if these\r\nrecent accessions to the Blaine camp are half as bad as the _Tribune_\r\nhas painted them in the past, that journal and its candidate must have\r\ntwo as disreputable allies as could be found outside of state\r\nprison.\"[1685] Woodin's manner of avoiding his Utica pledge seemed to\r\narouse more indignation than the mere breaking of it. The _Times_\r\ncalled it \"a sneaking fashion,\"[1686] and charged lack of courage. \"He\r\ndoes not believe that he who performs an act through another is\r\nhimself responsible for the act.\"[1687]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1685: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1686: _Ibid._, June 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1687: _Ibid._, May 8.]\r\n\r\nAt Chicago the principle of district representation became the\r\nimportant question. It involved the admission of many delegates, and\r\nafter two days of debate the convention sustained it by a vote of 449\r\nto 306.[1688] To complete the overthrow of the unit-rule a resolution\r\nwas also adopted providing that when any delegate excepted to the\r\ncorrectness of a vote as cast by the chairman of a delegation, the\r\npresident of the convention should direct a roll-call of the\r\ndelegation. This practically settled the result. Nevertheless, the\r\nbelief obtained, so strong was the Stalwarts' faith in their success,\r\nthat when the Blaine and Sherman forces broke to a compromise\r\ncandidate, Grant would gain the needed additional seventy-four votes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1688: The minority, representing fourteen States and ably led\r\nby Benjamin F. Tracy, sustained the authority of State conventions to\r\noverrule the choice of the districts.]\r\n\r\nConkling had never before attended a national convention. Indeed, he\r\nhad never been seen at a great political gathering west of the\r\nAlleghanies. But he now became the central figure of the convention,\r\nwith two-fifths of the delegates rallying under his leadership. His\r\nreception whenever he entered the hall was the remarkable feature of\r\nthe great gathering. Nothing like it had occurred in previous national\r\nconventions. Distinguished men representing favourite candidates had\r\nbeen highly honoured, but never before did the people continue, day\r\nafter day, to welcome one with such vociferous acclaim. It was not all\r\nfor Grant. The quick spontaneous outburst of applause that shook the\r\nbanners hanging from the girders far above, had in it much of\r\nadmiration for the stalwart form, the dominant spirit, the iron-nerved\r\nboss, who led his forces with the arrogance of a gifted, courageous\r\nchieftain. His coming seemed planned for dramatic effect. He rarely\r\nappeared until the audience, settled into order by the opening prayer\r\nor by the transaction of business, might easily catch sight of him,\r\nand as he passed down the long aisle, moving steadily on with graceful\r\nstride and immobile face, a flush of pride tinged his cheeks as cheer\r\nafter cheer, rolling from one end of the amphitheatre to the other,\r\nrent the air. He sat in the front row on the centre aisle, and about\r\nhim clustered Chester A. Arthur, Levi P. Morton, Benjamin F. Tracy,\r\nEdwards Pierrepont, George H. Sharpe, and the boyish figure of Charles\r\nE. Cornell, a pale, sandy, undersized youth, the son of the Governor,\r\nwho was represented by an alternate.[1689]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1689: \"Suggestions were made that the substitution of Mr.\r\nConkling for General Grant would give him the nomination, and there\r\nwas a moment when General Garfield apprehended such a result. There\r\nwas, however, never a time when it was possible. The 306 would never\r\nhave consented unless Grant's name were first withdrawn by his\r\nauthority. A firmer obstacle would have been Conkling's sturdy refusal\r\nto allow the use of his name under any circumstances.\"--Boutwell,\r\n_Reminiscences_, Vol. 2, p. 269.]\r\n\r\nConkling's presentation of Grant was largely relied upon to gain the\r\nneeded votes. Prior to 1876 little importance attached to such\r\nspeeches, but after the famous oration of Robert G. Ingersoll at\r\nCincinnati, which became influential almost to the point of success,\r\nthe solicitude exhibited in the selection of dominating speakers\r\nconstituted a new phase in convention politics and added immeasurably\r\nto the popular interest. By common consent Conkling was named to\r\npresent the Stalwarts' choice, and in most of the qualities desirable\r\nin such an address his was regarded the best of the day.\r\n\r\nThe lines of Private Miles O'Reilly,[1690] suggested to the Senator on\r\nthe evening before he spoke, caught the convention as quickly as did\r\nIngersoll's opening sentences in 1876, and all that followed, save his\r\nsarcasm and flashes of scorn, held the closest attention. \"His\r\nunmatched eloquence,\" said Brandegee of Connecticut.[1691] This was the\r\njudgment of an opponent. \"It had the warmth of eulogy, the finish of\r\na poem, the force and fire of a philippic,\" said the _Inter-Ocean_.[1692]\r\nThis was the judgment of a friend. All the art of which he was master\r\nfound expression in every sentence, polished and balanced with\r\nrhetorical skill, and delivered with the emphasis and inflection of a\r\ngreat orator. One critic thought it a revelation to find a man who\r\ncould be eloquent with studied composure, who could be fervid without\r\nwildness, and who could hold imagery and metaphor to the steady place\r\nof relentless logic without detracting from their special and peculiar\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1690:\r\n\r\n    \"When asked what State he hails from,\r\n      Our sole reply shall be,\r\n    He comes from Appomattox\r\n      And its famous apple-tree.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1691: From his speech nominating Elihu B. Washburne.--Chicago\r\n_Tribune_, June 7, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1692: Chicago _Inter-Ocean_, June 7, 1880.]\r\n\r\nNot content with reciting the achievements of his own candidate,\r\nConkling seriously weakened his oration as a vote-making speech by\r\nlaunching shafts of irony first into Sherman and then into Blaine.\r\n\"Nobody is really worried about a third term,\" he said in conclusion,\r\n\"except those hopelessly longing for a first term. Without patronage,\r\nwithout telegraph wires running from his house to this convention,\r\nwithout election contrivances, his name is on the country's lips.\r\nWithout bureaus, committees, officers, or emissaries to manufacture\r\nsentiment in his favour, without intrigue or effort, Grant is the\r\ncandidate whose supporters stand by the creed of the party, holding\r\nthe right of the majority as the very essence of their faith, and\r\nmeaning to uphold that faith against the charlatans and guerillas,\r\nwho, from time to time, deploy and forage between the lines.\"[1693] As\r\nthese sabre-cuts, dealt with the emphasis of gesture and inflection,\r\nflashed upon the galleries, already charmed with the accomplishment of\r\nhis speech and the grace of his sentiment, loud hisses, mingled with\r\ndistracting exclamations of banter and dissent, proclaimed that the\r\nspell of his magic was broken.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1693: New York _Times_, June 7.]\r\n\r\nBalloting for a candidate began on the fifth day. Many rumours\r\npreceded Conkling's method of announcing New York's vote, but when his\r\nturn came, he explained that although he possessed full instructions\r\nconcerning the true condition of the vote, he thought it better to\r\ncall the roll, since several of the delegates preferred to speak for\r\nthemselves. This plan, so adroitly submitted, made it impossible to\r\nconceal one's vote behind an anonymous total, and compelled John\r\nBirdsall, the Queens County senator, to lead in the disagreeable duty\r\nof disobeying the instructions of the State convention. Birdsall rose\r\nwith hesitation, and, after voting for Blaine in a subdued voice,\r\ndropped quickly into his seat as if anxious to avoid publicity. Then\r\nthe convention, having listened in perfect silence, ratified his work\r\nwith a chorus of hisses and applause. Gradually the anti-third termers\r\nexhibited more courage, and after Robertson and Husted had called out\r\ntheir candidate with an emphasis that indicated pride and defiance,\r\nthe applause drowned the hisses. Woodin's conduct contrasted sharply\r\nwith his usual courage. He was an aggressive member of the opposition,\r\nbut at this moment, when brave hearts, unflinching resolve, and\r\nunruffled temper were needed, he stood at the rear of the hall, while\r\nLeander Fitts, his alternate, upon whom he cast the responsibility of\r\nviolating a solemnly uttered pledge, feebly pronounced the name\r\n\"Blaine.\" The result of the roll-call gave Grant 51, Blaine 17, and\r\nSherman 2.[1694] On the seventeenth ballot Dennis McCarthy, a State\r\nsenator from Onondaga, changed his vote from Grant to Blaine. Thus\r\nmodified the New York vote continued until the thirty-sixth ballot,\r\nwhen the Blaine and Sherman delegates united, recording twenty votes\r\nfor Garfield to fifty for Grant. On this roll-call Grant received 306\r\nvotes to 399 for Garfield.[1695] Thus by a strange coincidence the\r\nStalwarts registered the fateful number that marked their strength\r\nwhen the unit rule was defeated. During the thirty-six roll-calls\r\nGrant's vote varied from 302 to 313, but in the stampede, when two\r\nhundred and fifteen Blaine men and ninety-six supporters of Sherman\r\nrushed into line for Garfield, the faithful 306 went down in defeat\r\ntogether. These figures justly became an insignia for the heroic.[1696]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1694: The first ballot was as follows: Grant, 304; Blaine,\r\n284; Sherman, 93; Edmunds, 34; Washburne, 30; Windom, 10. Whole number\r\nof votes, 755; necessary to a choice, 378.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1695: Thirty-fifth ballot: Grant, 313; Blaine, 257; Sherman,\r\n99; Edmunds, 11; Washburne, 23; Windom, 3; Garfield, 50. Thirty-sixth\r\nballot: Grant, 306; Blaine, 42; Sherman, 3; Washburne, 5; Garfield,\r\n399.\r\n\r\nConkling's peculiar manner of announcing New York's vote excited\r\ncriticism. \"Two delegates,\" he declared, \"are said to be for Sherman,\r\neighteen for Blaine, and fifty are for Grant.\" The chairman of the\r\nWest Virginia delegation, whom the Senator had sought to unseat,\r\nmimicking the latter's emphasis, announced: \"One delegate is said to\r\nbe for Grant, and eight are known to be for Blaine.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1696: Some months later Chauncey I. Filley, a delegate from\r\nSt. Louis, caused the Grant medals to be struck for the 306, on which\r\nwas emblazoned \"The Old Guard.\"]\r\n\r\nAfter Garfield's nomination the Stalwarts of the New York delegation\r\ndid not conceal their disappointment. When everybody else was cheering\r\nthey kept their seats, and while others displayed Garfield badges,\r\nthey sullenly sought their headquarters to arrange for the\r\nVice-Presidency. Leaders of the Garfield movement, now eager to\r\nstrengthen the ticket, looked to them for a candidate. New York\r\nbelonged in the list of doubtful States, and to enlist the men who\r\nseemed to control its destiny they instinctively turned to the\r\ndefeated faction. William M. Dennison, a former governor of Ohio,\r\npromptly made their wishes known, confidently counting upon Conkling's\r\ncoöperation, since the Senator had been the first on his feet to make\r\nGarfield's nomination unanimous. In doing so he expressed the hope\r\nthat the zeal and fervour of the convention would characterise its\r\nmembers \"in bearing the banner and carrying the lances of the\r\nRepublican party into the ranks of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nConkling's treatment of Dennison's request has been variously\r\nreported. One version is that he demanded the nomination of Chester A.\r\nArthur; another, that he sternly refused to make any suggestion.\r\nContemporary press reports confirm the first, basing it upon his\r\ndesire to vindicate Arthur and humiliate Sherman; the second is\r\nsupported by Alfred R. Conkling's biography of his uncle.[1697] But\r\nneither report is correct. Conkling bitterly resented Garfield's\r\nnomination, predicted his defeat at the polls, and did not hesitate to\r\ndissuade friends from accepting the nomination for Vice-President.\r\n\"The convention has nominated a candidate, but not a President,\" he\r\nsaid to Stewart L. Woodford. \"Since the nomination I have heard from\r\nan influential friend at Albany, who declares that Garfield cannot\r\ncarry New York. Now, the question is, whom shall we place upon the\r\naltar as a vicarious sacrifice? Mr. Morton has declined. Perhaps you\r\nwould like the nomination for Vice-President?\" Being assured that\r\nWoodford would accept it if tendered to him, Conkling added: \"I hope\r\nno sincere friend of mine will accept it.\"[1698]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1697: \"It has been asserted that this nomination was a boon to\r\nRoscoe Conkling to secure his support of Garfield. To deny this is almost\r\nsupererogatory. He sternly refused to make any suggestion.\"--Conkling,\r\n_Life of Conkling_, p. 607-608.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1698: Woodford's interview with the writer, October 4, 1908.]\r\n\r\nIn the event of Grant's nomination Levi P. Morton had been prominently\r\nmentioned as a proper candidate for Vice-President. He was then\r\nfifty-six years of age, and had achieved high reputation in banking\r\nand financial circles. Though not eloquent according to the canons of\r\noratory, he spoke with clearness, was widely intelligent, and had\r\ngiven careful attention to public questions. Conservative in his\r\nnature and sturdy in his principles, he always advised against\r\nrashness and counselled firmness. A single session in Congress had\r\nproven his zeal in the performance of public duty, and his fitness for\r\nVice-President was recognised then as it was eight years later when he\r\nbecame the running mate of Benjamin Harrison. Upon his nomination,\r\ntherefore, Garfield, before the convention had recessed, sent word by\r\nDennison that he desired Morton nominated for second place. Morton,\r\nanswering that his nomination must not be made without previous\r\nconsultation with his associates, immediately informed Conkling of\r\nGarfield's desire. Conkling replied, \"If you think the ticket will be\r\nelected; if you think you will be happy in the association, accept.\"\r\nTo this Morton answered, \"I have more confidence in your judgment than\r\nin my own.\" Conkling then added: \"Governor Boutwell of Massachusetts\r\nis a great friend of yours. Why don't you talk with him?\" Acting upon\r\nthis suggestion Morton sought Boutwell, who advised against it. Morton\r\nacquiesced and refused the use of his name.[1699]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1699: Mr. Morton's letter to the author, dated September 14,\r\n1908.]\r\n\r\nAfter returning to their headquarters at the hotel the Stalwarts, upon\r\nthe suggestion and insistence of George H. Sharpe, quickly agreed upon\r\nChester A. Arthur, who gave an affirmative response to their appeal.\r\nConkling was not present at the time, but subsequently in Arthur's\r\nroom, where Howard Carroll and several other delegates lingered, he\r\nbitterly opposed placing a Stalwart upon the ticket and expressed in\r\nunmeasured terms his disapprobation of Arthur's acceptance.[1700] On\r\ntheir way to the convention Sharpe told Woodford of the pungent\r\nflavour of Conkling's invective, and of Arthur's calm assertion of the\r\npropriety of his action. At the wigwam Conkling refused Sharpe's\r\nrequest to place Arthur in nomination.[1701]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1700: Letter of Howard Carroll to the author, dated October\r\n15, 1908.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1701: Interview of author with General Woodford.]\r\n\r\nUpon the reassembling of the convention California presented Elihu B.\r\nWashburne for Vice-President, a nomination which Dennis McCarthy of\r\nNew York, amidst cordial and hearty applause from the galleries,\r\nseconded in a forceful speech. This indicated that Arthur was _persona\r\nnon grata_ to the anti-Grant delegates of the Empire State. Jewell of\r\nConnecticut, Ferry of Michigan, Settle of North Carolina, and Maynard\r\nof Tennessee, were likewise presented. As the call of States proceeded\r\nNew York made no response in its turn, but when Woodford subsequently\r\nproposed the name of Arthur, Dennison responded with a spirited\r\nsecond, followed by delegates from New Jersey, Illinois, Mississippi,\r\nMaryland, Missouri, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. This array of backing\r\nbrought McCarthy to his feet, who withdrew his second to Washburne and\r\nmoved that Arthur's nomination, under a suspension of the rules, be\r\nmade by acclamation. This required a two-thirds vote and was lost.\r\nThen Campbell of West Virginia, amidst the loudest cheers of the\r\nevening, seconded the nomination of Washburne. \"Let us not do a rash\r\nthing.\" he said. \"The convention has passed a resolution favouring\r\ncivil service reform. Let us not stultify ourselves before the\r\ncountry.\"[1702]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1702: New York _Tribune_, June 9.]\r\n\r\nAt first Arthur's strength was confined to the Grant delegation,\r\ntwenty-five States showing an increase of only seventy votes, thirty\r\nof which came from the South. But as the roll-call proceeded New York,\r\nOhio, and Pennsylvania brought other States into line, the ballot\r\ngiving Arthur 468, Washburne 193, and other favourite sons 90.\r\n\r\nArthur's nomination was a distinct disappointment. To many it was an\r\noffence. Within the State leading Republican journals resented it by\r\nsilence, while others were conspicuously cold; without the State it\r\nencountered even greater disadvantages, since his dismissal as\r\ncollector of customs had advertised him as the enemy of reform, the\r\napostle of bossism, and the friend of whatever was objectionable in\r\npolitics.[1703] Yet his friends found a creditable record. He had\r\nsuccessfully opposed the well-known action of Jonathan Lemmon, who\r\nsought to recover eight slaves which he incautiously brought into New\r\nYork on his way from Virginia to Texas; he had established the right\r\nof coloured people to ride in the street-cars; and he had rendered\r\nvaluable service in the early years of the war as engineer-in-chief\r\nand quartermaster-general on the staff of Governor Morgan. He\r\npossessed, too, an inherited instinct for keeping faith with men. In\r\nhis relations with politicians of high or low degree there was not a\r\ntrace of dissimulation or double-dealing. His career is a study of the\r\nevolution of character. It is not strange, perhaps, that in the days\r\nof custom-house investigations and bitter partisan strife, when he was\r\nknown as an henchman of Conkling, there was a lack of public\r\nappreciation of the potentialities of a unique personality, but the\r\nArthur heritage included then as afterward absolute truthfulness,\r\nshrewdness of judgment, high-minded patriotism, and consciousness of\r\nmoral obligation.[1704]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1703: After the nomination John Sherman wrote to a personal\r\nfriend: \"The nomination of Arthur is a ridiculous burlesque, inspired,\r\nI fear, by a desire to defeat the ticket. His nomination attaches to\r\nthe ticket all the odium of machine politics, and will greatly\r\nendanger the success of Garfield. I cannot but wonder how a\r\nconvention, even in the heat and hurry of closing scenes, could make\r\nsuch a blunder.\"--Burton, _Life of Sherman_, p. 296.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1704: \"I do not think he [Arthur] knows anything. He can\r\nquote a verse of poetry, or a page from Dickens and Thackeray, but\r\nthese are only leaves springing from a root out of dry ground. His\r\nvital forces are not fed, and very soon he has given out his all.\"\r\nMrs. James G. Blaine, _Letters_ (February 21, 1882), Vol. 1, p. 309.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTILDEN, KELLY, AND DEFEAT\r\n\r\n1880\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Governor Robinson did not apparently change party\r\nsentiment respecting Tilden's renomination for the Presidency. No\r\nother candidate was seriously discussed. Indeed, the Democratic press\r\ncontinued to treat it as a matter of course, coupling with it the\r\nalleged subversion of an election, transcending in importance all\r\nquestions of administration, and involving the vital principle of\r\nself-government through elections by the people. This new issue,\r\ndwarfing all other policies, had been for three years the cornerstone\r\nof every Democratic platform in state, county, or congressional\r\nconvention. No argument seemed to weaken it, no event could destroy\r\nit. The Republican claim that the vote of three Southern States, as\r\ndeclared at the polls, was the result of terrorism and did not in any\r\nsense represent an honest expression of the popular will, made no\r\nimpression upon it. The well-known fact that Congress, because of the\r\nconfusion of the situation, had wisely sought a remedy in the\r\nElectoral Commission, which was passed by Democratic rather than\r\nRepublican votes, in nowise weakened the force of its appeal. Not even\r\ndid the disclosure that Tilden's house had become the headquarter of\r\nconfidential agents, who sought to corrupt the electors, produce any\r\nchange in it. The one declaration, patiently and persistently kept\r\nbefore the people, was that Tilden had been elected by the popular\r\nvote and defrauded by a false count of the electoral vote, and that\r\nthe supreme issue in 1880 must be whether \"this shall be a government\r\nby the sovereign people through elections, or a government by\r\ndiscarded servants holding over by force and fraud.\"[1705] The\r\nreiteration of this proposition made Tilden, it was claimed, the\r\nnecessary and inevitable candidate of the Cincinnati convention,\r\ncalled to meet on June 22. The party seemed to believe, what Tilden\r\nhimself had announced from his doorstep three years before, that the\r\ncountry would \"never condone fraud,\" and it did not propose to\r\nsacrifice a winning issue.[1706]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1705: Tilden's letter of June 18, 1880.--_Public Writings and\r\nSpeeches_, Vol. 2, pp. 502-506.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1706: \"If the Democrats do not nominate Mr. Tilden, they do\r\nrelinquish the fraud issue--the strength of their canvass.\"--New York\r\n_Sun_, June 22, 1880.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, many New York Democrats disliked Tilden. Their number,\r\nwhich the cipher disclosures materially increased, grew into\r\nthreatening proportions after Kelly's dissatisfaction had settled into\r\na relentless feud. This condition made Tilden's chances of carrying\r\nthe State uncertain if not absolutely nil, and encouraged his critics\r\nto magnify his weaknesses until the belief generally obtained that\r\nserious, perhaps fatal opposition would array itself at the State\r\nconvention on April 20. Statements as to Tilden's ill-health likewise\r\nfound currency. When not displaying evidence of unimpaired mental\r\nvigour in the courtroom, he was said to be on the verge of total\r\nparalysis.[1707] To his burdens the government also added another by\r\npursuing his income tax. This suit, commenced in January, 1877, and\r\ndestined to drag through five years until dismissed by the prosecution\r\nwithout costs to either party, was fixed for the April term in 1880,\r\nalthough the United States attorney admitted his unpreparedness for\r\ntrial.[1708] \"Thus was he persecuted with unrelenting virulence by the\r\nAdministration,\" says his biographer, \"and by the Republican press,\r\nwhich neglected no opportunity of refreshing the memory of its readers\r\nin regard to his imputed capacities for wickedness.\"[1709]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1707: The _Nation_, April 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1708: See district attorney's letter, Bigelow, _Life of\r\nTilden_, Vol. 2, pp. 254-259, 264.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1709: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to escape interruptions to which Gramercy Park exposed him,\r\nTilden settled in the summer of 1879 at Greystone on the Hudson, three\r\nmiles beyond the northernmost limit of the city, on the highest ground\r\nsouth of the Highlands. Here he brought a portion of his library; here\r\nhe mingled with his flocks and herds; and here in the seclusion of a\r\nnoble estate, with the comforts of a palatial stone dwelling, he\r\ndiscoursed with friends, who came from every part of the country to\r\nassure him that he alone could keep the party together. Ever silent as\r\nto his own intentions Tilden talked of the crime of 1876 until his\r\nvisitors, imbued with his own spirit, left him thoroughly impressed\r\nwith the importance of his renomination.\r\n\r\nBut Tilden did not trust the result to sentiment. Throughout New York\r\nDaniel E. Manning and other lieutenants held a tight rein, and when\r\nthe Syracuse convention assembled an early roll-call, on a resolution\r\nto determine the character of the Committee on Credentials, showed 295\r\nvotes for Tilden to 80 against him. If this overwhelming majority\r\nshocked the dissenters, it was not less a surprise to the regulars. In\r\nthe convention of 1876 Tilden mustered, including Tammany, only 201\r\nout of 375; now, after his enemies had exhausted their opposition, he\r\nproved stronger than in the closing months of his famous career as a\r\nreform governor. The result of this vote settled all controversies,\r\nleaving the convention free to appoint electors and to select\r\ndelegates to Cincinnati.[1710] It was not to adjourn, however, until it\r\nhad shown a serene and polite contempt for John Kelly. During the\r\nmorning John B. Haskin, on behalf of the Tammany convention, had\r\npresented a resolution expressing a desire for the union of the party\r\nand asking the appointment of a harmony committee. Ignoring the\r\nassembly from which he came, the convention treated the resolution as\r\na personal communication from Haskin, whom it assured, after politely\r\nreciprocating his desire for the union of the Democratic party, \"that\r\nthe deliberative wisdom of the national convention will result in such\r\naction as will secure the triumph of the Democratic party in the\r\nensuing election.\"[1711] This bitter rebuff, coupled with the\r\noverwhelming majority for Tilden, indicated a conscious strength which\r\ndeeply impressed the party in other States, and greatly aided in\r\ndemoralising opposition in New York.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1710: Delegates-at-large: Lucius Robinson, Calvin E. Pratt,\r\nRufus W. Peckham, and Lester B. Faulkner. The last named was chairman\r\nof the Democratic State committee.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1711: New York _Tribune_, April 21.]\r\n\r\nNor did the convention adjourn until its Committee on Resolutions\r\nsprung a further surprise. The delegates anticipated and applauded an\r\nelaborate statement of the fraud issue, but the presentation of Tilden\r\nas a candidate for President came with the suddenness of his\r\nunexpected majority. Manning did not intend to go so far. His courage\r\ncame with his strength. Proof of this, if any were needed, existed in\r\nthe fact that the endorsement was in manuscript, while the rest of the\r\nplatform was read from a printed slip. To define the situation more\r\nclearly the committee submitted a unit rule, declaring \"that in case\r\nany attempt is made to dismember or divide the delegation by\r\ncontesting the seats of a portion of the delegates, or if delegates\r\ncountenance such an attempt by assuming to act separately from the\r\nmajority, or fail to coöperate with such majority, the seats of such\r\ndelegates shall be deemed to be vacated.\"[1712] Never did convention\r\nadopt a more drastic rule. The reading of these ball and chain\r\nprovisions provoked hisses and widened the chasm between Tilden's\r\nconvention and John Kelly's side-show.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1712: New York _Sun_, April 21.]\r\n\r\nKelly's bolt in 1879 had proved his power to destroy; yet to his\r\nfriends, if not to himself, it must have been deeply humiliating to\r\nsee the fierce light of public interest turned entirely on Tilden.\r\nKelly also realised the more poignant fact that jealousy, distrust,\r\nand accumulated resentment lined the way he had marked out for\r\nhimself. Nevertheless, he walked on apparently heedless of the signs\r\nof conflict. Since the regular Democratic convention would not admit\r\nhim, he threateningly assembled one of his own in Shakespeare Hall, to\r\nbe used, if the party did not yield, in knocking at the door of the\r\nCincinnati convention. William Dorsheimer acted as its temporary\r\nchairman. Dorsheimer had become a political changeling. Within a\r\ndecade he had been a Republican, a Liberal, and a Democrat, and it was\r\nwhispered that he was already tired of being a Kellyite. His appeal\r\nfor Horatio Seymour indicated his restlessness. The feuds of Tilden\r\nand Church and Kernan and Kelly and Robinson had left Seymour the one\r\nDemocrat who received universal homage from his party, and it became\r\nthe fashion of Tilden's enemies to refer to the Oneidan as the only\r\none who could unite the party and carry the State. It did not matter\r\nto Dorsheimer that Seymour, having retired from active politics in\r\n1868, was placidly meditating at Deerfield, devoted to agricultural\r\nand historical interests. Nor did his clamour cease after the bucolic\r\nstatesman had declared that if he must choose between a funeral and a\r\nnomination he would take the first,[1713] since the mention of\r\nSeymour's name always waked an audience into cheers. Later in the day\r\nAmasa J. Parker, on taking the chair as president, artfully made use\r\nof the same ruse to arouse interest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1713: Letter to Dr. George L. Miller, New York _Tribune_,\r\nJune 21, 1880.]\r\n\r\nIt was not an enthusiastic convention. Many delegates had lost heart.\r\nKelly himself left the train unnoticed, and to some the blue badges,\r\nexploiting the purpose of their presence, indicated a fool's errand.\r\nIn the previous September they had refused to support Robinson, and\r\nhaving defeated him they now returned to the same hall to threaten\r\nTilden with similar treatment. This was their only mission.\r\nHumiliation did not possess them, however, until John B. Haskin\r\nreported that the regulars refused to recognise their existence. Then\r\nJohn Kelly threw off his muzzle, and with the Celtic-English of a\r\nTammany brave exhibited a violent and revolutionary spirit. \"Tilden\r\nwas elected by the votes of the people,\" said Kelly, \"and he had not\r\nsufficient courage after he was elected to go forward, as a brave man\r\nshould have gone forward, and said to the people of the country, 'I\r\nhave been elected by the votes of the people, and you see to it that I\r\nam inaugurated.' Nothing of the like did Mr. Tilden.\"[1714]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1714: New York _Sun_, April 21, 1880.]\r\n\r\nIn other words, Kelly thought Tilden an unfit candidate because he did\r\nnot decide for himself that he had been elected and proceed to take\r\nhis seat at the cost of a tremendous civil convulsion. Perhaps it was\r\nthis policy more than Kelly's personality which had begun to alienate\r\nDorsheimer. One who had been brought up in the bosom of culture and\r\nconservatism could have little confidence in such a man. The platform,\r\nthough bitter, avoided this revolutionary sentiment. It protested\r\nagainst the total surrender of the party to one man, who has \"cunning\"\r\nand \"unknown resources of wealth,\" and who \"attempts to forestall\r\npublic opinion, to preoccupy the situation, to overrule the majority,\r\nand to force himself upon the party to its ruin.\" It declared that\r\n\"Tildenism is personalism, which is false to Democracy and dangerous\r\nto the Republic,\" and it pronounced \"Tilden unfit for President\"\r\nbecause \"his political career has been marked with selfishness,\r\ntreachery, and dishonour, and his name irretrievably connected with\r\nthe scandals brought to light by the cipher despatches.\"[1715] Haskin\r\nproposed a more compact statement, declaring that \"the Democratic\r\nparty does not want any such money-grabber, railroad wrecker, and\r\nparalytic hypocrite at the helm of State.\"[1716]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1715: New York _Times_, April 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1716: New York _Times_, April 21.\r\n\r\nFor delegate-at-large to Cincinnati the convention selected the\r\nfollowing: Amasa J. Parker of Albany, William Dorsheimer of New York,\r\nJeremiah McGuire of Chemung, George C. Green of Niagara.]\r\n\r\nAfter the two conventions adjourned the question of chiefest interest\r\nwas, would Tilden seek the nomination at Cincinnati? The action of the\r\nconvention demonstrated that the regular party organisation was\r\nunaffected by the Kelly bolt, that Tilden controlled the party in the\r\nState, and that his nomination was a part of the programme. Moreover,\r\nit showed that the New York Democracy did not intend asking support\r\nupon any principle other than the issue of fraud. But intimations of\r\nTilden's purpose to decline a nomination found expression in the\r\nspeech and acts of men presumedly informed. Lester B. Faulkner's\r\nstatement, in calling the convention to order, that he did not know\r\nwhether the Governor would accept a renomination, coupled with the\r\nconvention's reply to Haskin, expressing confidence that the action at\r\nCincinnati would result in the Democracy's carrying New York, had made\r\na deep impression. To many these insinuations indicated that because\r\nof his health or for some unknown cause he was not seriously a\r\ncandidate. Others found reason for similar belief in the indisposition\r\nof prominent delegates to resent such a suggestion. One veteran\r\njournalist, skilled in reading the words and actions of political\r\nleaders, asserted with confidence that he would not be a candidate. To\r\nhim Tilden's name concealed a strategic movement, which, in the end,\r\nwould enable his friends to control the nomination for another.[1717]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1717: New York _Tribune_ (correspondence), April 21.]\r\n\r\nSuch interpretation found hosts of doubters. Without Tilden, it was\r\nsaid, the fraud issue would lose its influence. Besides, if he\r\nintended to withdraw, why did Kelly assemble his convention? Surely\r\nsome one, said they, would have given him an inkling in time to save\r\nhim from the contempt and humiliation to which he had subjected\r\nhimself. There was much force in this reasoning, and as the date of\r\nthe national convention approached the mystery deepened.\r\n\r\nTilden was not a paralytic, as Haskin proclaimed. He could not even be\r\ncalled an invalid. His attention to vexatious litigation evidenced\r\nunimpaired mental power, and his open life at Greystone proved that\r\nhis physical condition did not hide him from men. He undoubtedly\r\nrequired regular rest and sleep. His nervous system did not resist\r\nexcitement as readily as in the days of his battle with Tweed and the\r\nCanal ring. It is possible, too, that early symptoms of a confirmed\r\ndisease had then appeared, and that prudence dictated hygienic\r\nprecautions. Once, in December, 1879, when contemplating the strain of\r\nthe campaign of 1876, he questioned his ability to go through another.\r\nAgain, in the early spring of 1880, after prolonged intellectual\r\neffort, he remarked in rather a querulous tone, \"If I am no longer fit\r\nto prepare a case for trial, I am not fit to be President of the\r\nUnited States.\" Such casual remarks, usually made to a confidential\r\nfriend, seemed to limit his references to his health.[1718] He\r\ndoubtless felt disinclined, as have many stronger men, to meet the\r\nstrain that comes when in pursuit of high public office, but there is\r\nno evidence that ill-health, if it really entered into his\r\ncalculations, was the determining factor of his action. Conditions in\r\nthe Republican party had changed in the Empire State since the\r\nnomination of Garfield. Besides, the cipher disclosures had lost him\r\nthe independent vote which he received in 1876. This left only the\r\nregulation party strength, minus the Kelly vote. In 1876 Tilden's\r\nmajority was 26,568, and in 1879 Kelly polled 77,566. If Kelly's bolt\r\nin 1880, therefore, should carry one-half or only one-quarter of the\r\nvotes it did in 1879, Tilden must necessarily lose New York which\r\nmeant the loss of the election. These were conditions, not theories,\r\nthat confronted this hard-headed man of affairs, who, without\r\nsentiment, never failed to understand the inexorable logic of facts.\r\nNevertheless, Tilden wanted the endorsement of a renomination. This\r\nwould open the way for a graceful retreat. Yet, to shield him from\r\npossible defeat, he secretly gave Manning a letter, apparently\r\ndeclining to run again, which could be used if needed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1718: John Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 2, pp. 265, 271.]\r\n\r\nOn reaching Cincinnati Manning found that a multiplicity of candidates\r\nmade it difficult to determine Tilden's strength. The ranks of the\r\nopposition, based on cipher disclosures and Kelly's threats, rapidly\r\nstrengthened, and although many friends of other candidates thought it\r\nless hazardous to nominate him than to repudiate him, ominous warnings\r\npiled up like thunder clouds on a summer day. Meantime New York's\r\nactive canvass for Henry B. Payne of Ohio seemed to conflict with\r\nTilden's candidacy, while Tilden's remarks, spoken in moments of\r\nphysical discouragement, added to the impression that he did not seek\r\nthe nomination. But why did he not say so? Manning, supposing he was\r\nthe sole possessor of the letter and believing the time not yet ripe\r\nfor producing it, kept his own counsels. Tilden, however, had given a\r\nduplicate to his brother Henry, who now announced through the press\r\nthat Tilden had forwarded a communication. This reached Cincinnati on\r\nthe eve of the convention.\r\n\r\nIt was long and characteristic. He recalled his services as a private\r\ncitizen in overthrowing the Tweed ring and purifying the judiciary,\r\nand as governor of the State in breaking up the Canal ring, reducing\r\nthe taxes, and reforming the administration. He told the familiar\r\nstory of the \"count out\"; maintained that he could, if he pleased,\r\nhave bought \"proof of the fraud\" from the Southern returning boards;\r\nand accused Congress of \"abdicating its duty\" in referring the count\r\nto the Electoral Commission. Since 1876, he said, he had been \"denied\r\nthe immunities of private life without the powers conferred by public\r\nstation,\" but he had done all in his power to keep before the people\r\n\"the supreme issue\" raised by the events of that year. Now, however,\r\nhe felt unequal to \"a new engagement which involves four years of\r\nceaseless toil. Such a work of renovation after many years of misrule,\r\nsuch a reform of systems and policies, to which I would cheerfully\r\nhave sacrificed all that remained to me of health and life, is now, I\r\nfear, beyond my strength.\"[1719]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1719: Tilden's _Public Writings and Speeches_, Vol. 2, pp.\r\n502-506.]\r\n\r\nTilden did not intend this to be a letter of withdrawal. With the hope\r\nof stimulating loyalty he sought to impress upon the delegates his\r\nvicarious sacrifice and the need of holding to the fraud issue. This\r\nwas the interpretation quickly given it by his enemies. Kelly declared\r\nit a direct bid for the nomination. But a majority of the New York\r\ndelegation regretfully accepted it as final. Nevertheless, many ardent\r\nTilden men, believing the letter had strengthened him, insisted upon\r\nhis nomination. The meeting of the delegation proved a stormy one.\r\nBold charges of infidelity to Tilden reacted against Payne, and to\r\nescape controversy Manning indiscreetly asked if he might yield to the\r\npressure which his letter had stimulated. To this Tilden could make\r\nbut one reply: \"My action is irrevocable. No friend must cast a doubt\r\non my sincerity.\"[1720]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1720: John Bigelow, _Life of Tilden_, Vol. 2, p. 272.]\r\n\r\nThere is something pathetic in this passing of Tilden, but there seems\r\nno reason for surprise. Tilden was essentially an opportunist. He\r\nattacked the Tweed ring after its exposure; he made war upon the Canal\r\nring after its record had become notorious; and he reduced the State\r\ntaxes after the war debt had been paid. Upon these reforms he rode\r\ninto power, and upon the cry of fraud he hoped to ride again to\r\nsuccess. He was much too acute not to know that the cipher disclosures\r\nhad robbed him of the rôle of reformer, but he seems to have been\r\nblind to the obvious fact that every one else was also aware of it.\r\nBesides, he lacked boldness and was at times the victim of indecision.\r\nHe was singularly unfortunate, moreover, in failing to attract a\r\ncircle of admirers such as usually surround public men of great\r\nprominence. Nevertheless, the opinion then obtained, and a quarter of\r\na century perhaps has not changed it, that had Manning, when he\r\nreached the convention city, boldly and promptly demanded Tilden's\r\nnomination it could have been secured. Whether, if tendered him, he\r\nwould have accepted it, \"no one,\" says Bigelow, \"is competent to\r\naffirm or deny. He probably did not know himself.\"[1721]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1721: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, New York lost whatever prestige it had inherited through\r\nhim. Payne had the support of barely a majority of the delegation,[1722]\r\nSamuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania, who had relied upon it, was angry,\r\nand the first roll-call showed that Winfield S. Hancock and Thomas F.\r\nBayard held the leading places.[1723] This contrasted sharply with its\r\nearly success. George Hoadley of Ohio, Tilden's devoted friend, had\r\nbeen made temporary chairman; Kelly, rising to address the convention,\r\nhad felt most keenly the absence of a friend in the chair; and a\r\ntwo-thirds majority excluded the Shakespeare Hall delegation. Such\r\ninfluence, however, was at an end. The delegation affected control\r\nwhen Rufus H. Peckham declared from the platform that as Tilden had\r\nrenounced all claims New York would support Randall; but the\r\nconvention failed to join in the excited cheers of the Philadelphians,\r\nwhile the roll-call soon disclosed Hancock as the favourite. Before\r\nthe result was announced officially Wisconsin asked permission to\r\nchange its twenty votes to the soldier, and in the twinkling of an eye\r\nthe stampede began. At the conclusion of the changes Hancock had\r\nreceived all the votes cast save 33.[1724] William H. English of\r\nIndiana, a rich man, who had served four terms in Congress during the\r\nadministrations of Presidents Pierce and Buchanan, was nominated for\r\nVice-President. The platform favoured a tariff for revenue only,\r\nexploited the election fraud, demanded honest money of coin or paper\r\nconvertible into coin, and stoutly opposed Chinese immigration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1722: The vote of the delegation stood as follows: Paine, 38;\r\nTilden, 11; English, 11; Bayard, 6; Hancock, 3; Randall, 1. Under the\r\nunit rule this gave Payne the entire number, 70.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1723: The first ballot gave Hancock, 171; Bayard, 153-1/2;\r\nPayne, 81-1/2; Thurman, 68-1/2; Field, 65; Morrison, 62; Hendricks,\r\n49-1/2; Tilden, 38; with a few votes to minor candidates. Whole number\r\nof votes, 728. Necessary to a choice, 486.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1724: Before changes were made the second ballot gave Hancock\r\n319; Randall, 129-1/2; Bayard, 113; Field, 65-1/2; Thurman, 50;\r\nHendricks, 31; English, 19; Tilden, 6; scattering, 3. After the\r\nchanges the result was as follows: Hancock, 705; Hendricks, 30;\r\nTilden, 1; Bayard, 2.]\r\n\r\nAfter Hancock's nomination Kelly's inning began. The convention had\r\ntreated him coldly. On the first day, when New York was called,\r\ndesiring to protest against seating a member of the regular\r\ndelegation, he sought recognition from a seat among the alternates,\r\nbut Hoadley, without the slightest sign of seeing or hearing him,\r\nordered the roll-call to proceed. The overwhelming rejection of his\r\ndelegation was not less crushing. The vote combined a compliment to\r\nTilden and an official utterance against the action of his great\r\nenemy, and as the States, answering promptly and sharply, dealt death\r\nto bolting and paralysis to Tammany it became evident to the blindest\r\nthat Tilden possessed the confidence of his party. In spite of the\r\nfriendly relations between Hendricks and Kelly, Indiana voted a solid\r\nNo. Nine other States, including Kentucky, Louisiana, and North\r\nCarolina, did likewise. Indeed, nearly two-thirds of the Southern\r\ndelegates ranged themselves against the Boss. To add to the public\r\nproof of Kelly's weakness New York asked to be excused from\r\nvoting.[1725]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1725: The vote stood, without New York, 205 to 457 in favor\r\nof rejecting the Shakespeare Hall delegation. With New York it would\r\nhave been thirty-nine more than a two-thirds majority.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Kelly had his friends. They were not as strong in\r\nnumbers or in voice as those who cheered Conkling at Chicago, but in\r\nthe absence of a master-mind the galleries seized upon the Tammany\r\nleader and cheered whenever he appeared. To give greater spectacular\r\neffect to his first greeting, Wade Hampton of South Carolina got upon\r\nhis crutches and stumped down the aisle to shake him solemnly by the\r\nhand. Kelly, however, did not reach the culminating point of his\r\npicturesque rôle until Hancock's nomination. After Randall, Hampton,\r\nand others had spoken, cries for Kelly brought to the platform a\r\ndelegation of Tammany leaders walking arm in arm, with John Kelly,\r\nAugustus Schell, Amasa J. Parker, and George C. Green in front. The\r\nconvention, save the New York delegation, leaped to its feet, and when\r\nKelly declared that hereafter whoever alluded to the differences which\r\nhad heretofore existed in the New York Democracy should be considered\r\na \"traitor to his party,\" the great enthusiasm forced cheers from\r\none-half of the New York delegation. To make the love-feast complete,\r\nJohn R. Fellows, finally responding to impatient calls from all parts\r\nof the hall, also took the platform.\r\n\r\nFellows, still in his forties, had had a varied, perhaps a brilliant\r\ncareer. Born in Troy he found his way in early boyhood to Arkansas,\r\njoined the Confederate army, fought at Shiloh, escaped from Vicksburg,\r\nsurrendered at Port Hudson, and remained a prisoner of war until June,\r\n1865. Returning to Arkansas he served in the State Senate, and in 1868\r\ncame to New York, where he secured an appointment in the office of the\r\nDistrict Attorney. Public attention became instantly fixed on the\r\nattractive figure of the intrepid young assistant. He leaped into\r\nrenown. He soon became the principal Democratic speaker in the city,\r\nand from the first followed the fortunes of the pale, eager form of\r\nthe distinguished reform Governor. At Cincinnati he represented the\r\nconservative Tilden men, and although upon reaching the platform he\r\nfaced a man of greater force, he betrayed no docile character, ready\r\nto receive passively whatever the Boss might allot. His speech was\r\ncleverly framed. He expressed no desire that Tilden Democrats be\r\nforgiven for the political sins which their opponents had committed;\r\nneither did he mar the good feeling of the occasion. But when, at the\r\nconclusion of his remarks, John Kelly stepped forward, seized his\r\nhand, and began working it up and down like a handle, Fellows stood\r\nstiffly and passionlessly as a pump, neither rejecting nor accepting\r\nthe olive branches thrust upon him. Thus ended the great scene of the\r\nreconciliation of the New York Democracy.\r\n\r\nWhen plucked the fruit of this reunion was found not to be very\r\ntoothsome. Returning to New York, Tammany held a ratification meeting\r\n(July 1) in which the regulars would not unite. Subsequently the\r\nregulars held a meeting (July 28) at which Tilden presided, and which\r\nTammany did not attend. Similar discord manifested itself respecting\r\nthe choice of a chief judge for the Court of Appeals. The Republican\r\nState Committee had chosen Charles J. Folger, but when the regulars\r\nadvocated the same method of selection Kelly defiantly issued a call\r\n(August 14) for a State convention. Such bossism, the product of a\r\nstrange, fitful career, was only less dramatic than that of Tweed. At\r\na subsequent conference Kelly submitted a letter stating that if a\r\nconvention were regularly summoned and Tammany given its full share of\r\ndelegates and committeemen, his call would be withdrawn.[1726] To this\r\nthe regulars finally yielded, and a State convention, held at Saratoga\r\non September 28, made Kelly its head and front. His advent evoked the\r\nloudest cheers, his demand for five members of the State committee met\r\nlittle resistance, and Dorsheimer, besides serving as chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Resolutions, presented the name of Charles J. Rapallo,\r\nwho became the nominee for chief judge of Appeals. Thus within a few\r\nmonths Kelly had defeated Robinson for governor, prevented Tilden's\r\nnomination for President, and imposed his will upon the regular\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1726: For a copy of this letter, see New York _Tribune_,\r\nAugust 28.]\r\n\r\nIn the selection of municipal candidates he was not less successful.\r\nIrving Hall insisted upon naming the mayor, and for many weeks the\r\nbickering and bargaining of conference committees resulted in nothing.\r\nFinally, Kelly proposed that the regulars select several satisfactory\r\npersons from whom he would choose. Among those submitted was the name\r\nof William Russell Grace, a respected merchant, a native of Ireland, a\r\nRoman Catholic in religion, and a man of large wealth, but without\r\nofficial experience of any kind. This was better, it was said, than\r\nofficial experience of the wrong kind. Irving Hall included his name\r\nwith considerable reluctance. It distrusted his loyalty, since a\r\nrumour, too well founded not to cause alarm, revealed Kelly's interest\r\nin him. But Kelly's cunning equalled his audacity. He had secured the\r\nnomination of Rapallo by voting for William C. Ruger of Onondaga, and\r\nhe now caused it to be understood that under no circumstances would\r\nGrace be acceptable. The merchant's name once upon the list, however,\r\nthe Boss snapped it up with avidity, while the Germans muttered\r\nbecause three of the five city candidates were Irishmen. Thus the\r\ncampaign opened badly for the Democrats.\r\n\r\nNor did it open more auspiciously for the Republicans. Garfield's part\r\nin the Crédit Mobilier scandal was reviewed without regard to the\r\nvindicatory evidence, while Nast's incriminating cartoon of 1873[1727]\r\nemphasised the failure of the great artist to introduce the Republican\r\ncandidate into his campaign pictures of 1880. It advertised the fact\r\nthat Nast retained his early opinion of the nominee's conduct. Further\r\nto alienate the independent vote it was charged that Garfield, during\r\nthe visit of Grant and Conkling at Mentor (September 28), had\r\nsurrendered to the Stalwarts. Appearances did not discourage such a\r\nbelief. Conkling's hostility disclosed at Chicago was emphasised by\r\nhis withdrawal from New York City on the day that Garfield entered it\r\n(August 5). Subsequently, in his initial speech of the campaign\r\n(September 17), Conkling's first important words were a sneer at Hayes\r\nand an implied threat at Garfield.[1728] Yet two weeks later the\r\nSenator, while on a speaking tour through Ohio and Indiana, went out\r\nof his way, riding three-fourths of a mile through a heavy rain, to\r\ncall upon Garfield. This looked as if somebody had surrendered. As a\r\nmatter of fact Conkling did not meet Garfield in private, nor did they\r\ndiscuss any political topic,[1729] but the apparent sudden collapse of\r\nConkling's dislike supplied Garfield's opponents with abundance of\r\npowder. Meantime the loss of the September election in Maine crushed\r\nRepublican hope. A victory had been confidently expected, and the\r\nfailure to secure it, although the adverse majority was less than two\r\nhundred, sent a chill to every Republican heart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1727: _Harper's Weekly_, May 15, 1873.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1728: Conkling's speech is printed in full in the New York\r\n_Tribune_ of September 18, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1729: Alfred R. Conkling, _Life of Roscoe Conkling_, pp.\r\n623-625.\r\n\r\n\"I was informed by Mr. Conkling that he had not been alone one minute\r\nwith General Garfield, intending by that care-taking to avoid the\r\nsuggestion that his visit was designed to afford an opportunity for\r\nany personal or party arrangement.\"--Boutwell, _Reminiscences_, Vol.\r\n2, p. 272.]\r\n\r\nSpurred to greater effort by this blighting disappointment, the\r\nRepublicans regained courage by a spirited presentation of the\r\nindustrial question, which was strongly reinforced by returning\r\nactivity in trade and commerce. To offset its effect and to win the\r\nindustrial masses to Democratic support, lithographic copies of the\r\nso-called \"Morey letter,\" approving Chinese immigration, which\r\npurported to be written by Garfield, were spread broadcast (October\r\n20) over the country. Garfield promptly branded it a forgery. Though\r\nthe handwriting and especially the signature resembled his,\r\naccumulating evidence and the failure to produce the man to whom the\r\nletter purported to be addressed, rapidly made clear its fictitious\r\ncharacter. Nevertheless, many Democratic journals and orators, notably\r\nAbraham S. Hewitt, assuming its genuineness, used it with tremendous\r\nforce as favouring Chinese competition with home labour.\r\n\r\nTo add to the slanderous character of the closing days of the campaign\r\nJohn Kelly, through the New York _Express_, rained fierce personal\r\nassaults upon the distinguished editor of the New York _Herald_, who\r\nopposed Grace. In bitterness the mayoralty fight surpassed the\r\npresidential contest. Hints of a division of public money for\r\nsectarian purposes had deeply stirred the city and given prominence to\r\nWilliam Dowd, the Republican candidate, whose interest in the common\r\nschools characterised his public activities. Dowd had the support of\r\nmany members of Irving Hall, who, as they gnashed their teeth in\r\nresentment of Kelly's cunning, became unweariedly active in combining\r\nthe strange and various elements of opposition. Not Daniel himself\r\nwas more uncomfortably encompassed than Grace.\r\n\r\nThe October elections in Ohio and Indiana plainly indicated the trend\r\nof public opinion, and on November 3 the Republicans carried New York\r\nand the country.[1730] The significant point in the State returns,\r\nhowever, was the severe punishment administered to Kelly. Whomsoever\r\nhe supported suffered humiliation. Hancock received 21,000 votes less\r\nthan Garfield, Rapallo 55,000 less than Folger, and Grace 38,000 less\r\nthan Hancock. In the presence of such a showing the Brooklyn _Eagle_,\r\na Democratic journal friendly to Tilden, thus philosophised: \"Bosses\r\nand thorough organisation are incompatible. The success of\r\norganisation depends upon reason. The success of the boss is due to\r\nunderhand arts. No young man can hope for the favour of a boss who\r\ndoes not begin by cultivating the temper of a lick-spittle.\"[1731]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1730: Garfield, 555,544; Hancock, 534,511; Weaver\r\n(Greenback), 12,373.

They\r\nwanted to learn their voting strength, and to encourage assemblymen to\r\noppose George H. Sharpe, the Stalwart candidate, the _Tribune_, in\r\ndouble-leaded type, announced, apparently with authority, that the\r\nPresident-elect would not allow them to suffer.[1732] This sounded a\r\ntrifle warlike. It also quickly enhanced the stress between the\r\nopposing factions, for those who are themselves not averse to\r\nwire-pulling are morbidly suspicious of intrigue in others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1732: New York _Tribune_ (editorial), January 3, 1881.]\r\n\r\nBut nothing came of the _Tribune's_ announcement. Sharpe's creditable\r\nservice on Grant's staff, his cleverness as a Stalwart manager, and\r\nhis acceptability as a speaker of the preceding Assembly, brought him\r\ntroops of friends. Although making no pretensions to the gift of\r\noratory, he possessed qualities needed for oratorical success. He was\r\nforceful, remarkably clear, with impressive manners and a winning\r\nvoice. As a campaign speaker few persons in the State excelled him.\r\nMen, too, generally found him easy of approach and ready to listen. At\r\nall events his tactful management won a majority of the Republican\r\nassemblymen before the opposition got a candidate into the field.\r\nUnder these circumstances members did not fancy staking good committee\r\nappointments against the uncertainty of Presidential favours, and in\r\nthe end Sharpe's election followed without dissent.\r\n\r\nIn the election of a United States senator to succeed Francis Kernan\r\non March 4, the Stalwarts did not find such smooth sailing. For\r\nseveral years, ever since the gubernatorial nomination in 1876,\r\njealousy, accumulated resentment, and inevitable distrust had divided\r\nthem, but not until Thomas C. Platt of Owego and Richard Crowley of\r\nNiagara announced their candidacy did the smouldering bitterness burst\r\ninto a blaze. Cornell and his friends promptly declared for Platt,\r\nwhile Arthur, Sharpe, Thomas Murphy, and John F. Smyth, known as ultra\r\nConkling men, wheeled into line for Crowley. Conkling held aloof. He\r\nprobably preferred Levi P. Morton, although each candidate claimed to\r\nbe his preference. In the end Morton's name was tangled up in the\r\ncontroversy, but he did not really get into it. Besides, a place in\r\nthe Cabinet seemed open to him.\r\n\r\nAt this time Cornell was at the height of his power. Prior to his\r\ninauguration he had not stood for much in the way of statesmanship. He\r\nwas known principally as the maker and chauffeur of Conkling's\r\nmachine, which he subsequently turned over to Arthur, who came later\r\ninto the Conkling connection from the Morgan wing. Moreover, the\r\nmanner of his election, the loss of many thousand Republican votes,\r\nand his reappointment of Smyth seriously discredited him. But friend\r\nand foe admitted that he had shown real ability as governor. He had\r\nabout him no angles and no surprises. He exercised authority\r\ncautiously, marshalled facts with skill, and presented clear and\r\nenlightened reasons for his action. He seemed to be above rather than\r\nbelow the level of his party, and his official colleagues, working in\r\nharmony with his policies, found him honourable, if sometimes stubborn\r\nand aggressive.\r\n\r\nBut in his relations to men as well as to policies he had betrayed a\r\ndisposition to change position. He did not attend the Chicago\r\nconvention. Nor did Arthur's nomination, brought about largely by\r\nSharpe's activity, particularly please him. While he behaved with\r\ndecorum and perhaps with loyalty, it was evident that if he did not\r\nraise the standard of revolt, he had chosen to fight for his hand.\r\nThis became the more apparent as the senatorial contest progressed. A\r\ngrim darksomeness about the expression of his countenance showed that\r\nhe took a sullen satisfaction in humiliating those who had humiliated\r\nhim. It was deftly done, but in the result it left its impression.\r\n\r\nCrowley, then in his forty-sixth year, was well equipped for the\r\nSenate. As a forceful speaker he was an object of respect even by his\r\nopponents. In whatever legislative body he appeared he ranked amongst\r\nthe foremost debaters, generally speaking with an enlightenment and a\r\nmoderation that did credit to his intellect and to the sweetness of\r\nhis nature. He had served four years in the State Senate, one term in\r\nCongress, and eight years as United States attorney in the Northern\r\nDistrict, being justly distinguished as one of the able men of Western\r\nNew York. He was sadly handicapped, however, by the infirmity of his\r\nbackers. Sharpe excited the deepest resentment by withholding the\r\nappointment of the Assembly committees;[1733] and Smyth and Murphy\r\nrepresented all that was undesirable in politics.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1733: \"Senator Woodin spoke of Truman G. Younglove, the only\r\nspeaker in the history of the State who had dared to hold back the\r\ncommittees in order to influence a senatorial caucus, as a 'political\r\ncorpse,' and said that Sharpe would share his fate.\"--New York\r\n_Tribune_, January 13, 1881.]\r\n\r\nCornell was fortunate in his candidate. Platt's cool, quiet methods\r\nhad aroused little antipathy, while around him gathered loyalty and\r\ngratitude. Very early in the contest, too, it began to be whispered\r\nthat if elected he might act independently of Conkling. To think of a\r\nlight-weight sparring up to a recognised champion tickled the\r\nimagination of the Independents who numbered about forty, of whom\r\nChauncey M. Depew was the choice of a majority.[1734] Ira Davenport of\r\nSteuben, a State senator of decided character and strength, supported\r\nhis brother-in-law, Sherman S. Rogers of Erie, and others talked of\r\nVice-President Wheeler. George William Curtis argued that the aim of\r\nthe Independents should be to vote for the cause even if they voted\r\nfor different candidates, and thus show to the country and to Garfield\r\nthat a large and resolute opposition to the ruling organisation\r\nexisted in the party.[1735]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1734: \"Blaine, representing Garfield, came to New York and\r\nasked me to enter the contest for the purpose of securing the election\r\nof a senator who would support the Administration. That was the reason\r\nwhy I became a candidate.\"--Interview of Mr. Depew with the author,\r\nFebruary 19, 1909.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1735: _Harper's Weekly_, February 5, 1881.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Depew's friends thought it wiser to \"split the\r\nmachine.\" It was a taking proposition. If the two senators, they\r\nargued, differed upon questions of patronage, the one agreeing with\r\nthe President would undoubtedly prevail. Thus the Senator and the\r\nGovernor, backed by the patronage of the State and Federal\r\nadministrations, would control a machine of great possibilities.\r\nConkling appreciated the danger, and Warner Miller and William H.\r\nRobertson approved the plan.\r\n\r\nMiller was then in the prime of life. He combined the occupations of\r\nmanufacturer and farmer, evidenced marked capacity for business, and\r\ngave substantial promise of growing leadership. From the schools of\r\nOswego he had entered Union College, and after teaching in Fort Edward\r\nCollegiate Institute he became a soldier. Since 1874 he had been in\r\nthe Assembly and in Congress. He was fully six feet tall, well\r\nproportioned, with a large head, a noticeably high forehead, a strong,\r\nself-reliant, colourless face, and a resolute chin. A blond moustache\r\ncovered a firm mouth. He had the appearance of a man of reserve power,\r\nand as a speaker, although without the gift of brilliantly phrased\r\nsentences, he made a favourable impression. His easy, simple manner\r\nadded to the vigour and clearness of his words. Perhaps in the end he\r\nfell short of realising the full measure of strength that his ardent\r\nfriends anticipated, for he possessed none of the characteristics of\r\nthe boss and seemed incapable of submitting to the daily drudgery that\r\npolitical leadership demands. But for several years the reasonableness\r\nof his opinions had an unmistakable influence upon the judgment of\r\nmen. Certainly, in 1881, his opinion greatly strengthened the Depew\r\nscheme, and it soon became apparent that a sufficient number of\r\nIndependents could be relied upon to choose Platt. In the conference\r\nthat followed the latter promised to support the Garfield\r\nadministration. \"Does that statement cover appointments?\" asked\r\nWoodin. Platt said it did. \"Even if Judge Robertson's name should be\r\nsent in?\" insisted Woodin. Platt replied, \"Yes.\"[1736] That settled it,\r\nand Platt's nomination occurred on the first ballot.[1737] Among the\r\nearliest to send him congratulations was Senator Conkling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1736: Interview of Mr. Depew with the author, March 28, 1909.\r\nSee also New York _Tribune_, January 9, 1882. \"Among others present at\r\nthe conference,\" added Depew, \"were Webster Wagner, John Birdsall,\r\nDennis McCarthy, and William H. Robertson of the State Senate, James\r\nW. Husted, and George Dawson of the Albany _Evening Journal_. Woodin\r\nremarked, 'We can trust Platt, and when he's elected senator we shall\r\nnot need a step-ladder to reach his ear.'\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1737: Total vote in caucus, 105. Necessary to a choice, 53.\r\nPlatt, 54; Crowley, 26; Rogers, 10; Wheeler, 10; Lapham, 4; Morton, 1.\r\n\r\nThe election, which occurred on January 18, resulted: Senate, Platt,\r\n25; Kernan, 6; Assembly, Platt, 79, Kernan, 44.]\r\n\r\nAfter the campaign of 1880 Conkling seemed to dismiss the feeling\r\nexhibited toward Garfield at Chicago, and in February (1881), at the\r\ninvitation of the President-elect, he visited Mentor. The Senator\r\nasked the appointment of Levi P. Morton as secretary of the treasury,\r\nand Garfield consented to give him the Navy, or select Thomas L. James\r\nfor postmaster-general. \"This conference was not wholly\r\nsatisfactory,\"[1738] but Conkling's position at the inauguration\r\nceremonies, voluntarily taken directly behind Garfield while the\r\nlatter read his inaugural address, indicated a real friendship. His\r\nmotion in the Senate that James be confirmed as postmaster-general\r\nwithout the usual reference to a committee seemed to support this\r\nbelief, an impression subsequently stimulated by the prompt\r\nconfirmation of William M. Evarts for commissioner to the\r\nInternational Monetary Conference, Henry G. Pearson for postmaster of\r\nNew York, and Levi P. Morton for minister to France.[1739] Two weeks\r\nlater came a bunch of five Stalwarts.[1740] The next day (March 23)\r\nGarfield nominated William H. Robertson for collector of customs at\r\nNew York and Edwin A. Merritt for consul-general to London. \"That\r\nevens things up,\" said Dennis McCarthy, the well-known Half-breed of\r\nthe State Senate. \"This is a complete surprise,\" added Robertson. \"To\r\nmy knowledge no one has solicited for me any place under Garfield. It\r\ncomes entirely unsought.\"[1741] It was no less a surprise to the\r\nStalwarts. Not a hint of it had been dropped by the President. \"We had\r\nbeen told only a few hours before,\" wrote Conkling, \"that no removals\r\nin the New York offices were soon to be made or even considered, and\r\nhad been requested to withhold the papers and suggestions bearing on\r\nthe subject until we had notice from the President of his readiness to\r\nreceive them.\"[1742] Indeed, the nomination came with such suddenness\r\nthat the action seemed to be hasty and ill considered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1738: Alfred R. Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, p. 634.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1739: Morton declined the navy portfolio, preferring the\r\nmission to France.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1740: Stewart L. Woodford, U.S. attorney, and Louis F. Payn,\r\nU.S. marshal for the Southern District; Asa W. Tenney, U.S. attorney\r\nfor the Eastern District; Clinton D. MacDougall, U.S. marshal for the\r\nNorthern District; and John Tyler, collector of customs, Buffalo.\r\nThese were reappointments.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1741: New York _Tribune_, March 24, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1742: From Conkling's letter of resignation.--New York\r\n_Tribune_, May 17, 1881.]\r\n\r\nThere is much literature on the subject. Reminiscences of public men\r\nduring the last decade have opened a flood of memories, some of them\r\ngiving specific statements from the principal actors. Blaine assured\r\nGeorge S. Boutwell that he had no knowledge of Robertson's nomination\r\nuntil it had been made, and Garfield told Marshall Jewell that Blaine,\r\nhearing of the nomination, came in very pale and much astonished.[1743]\r\nGarfield wrote (May 29, 1881) Thomas M. Nichols, once his private\r\nsecretary, that \"the attempt to shift the fight to Blaine's shoulders\r\nis as weak as it is unjust. The fact is, no member of the Cabinet\r\nbehaves with more careful respect for the rights of his brother men\r\nthan Blaine. It should be understood that the Administration is not\r\nmeddling in New York politics. It only defends itself when\r\nassailed.\"[1744] The President said to Conkling, declares Hoar, that he\r\ndesired to make one conspicuous appointment of a New York man who had\r\nsupported him against Grant, and that thereafter, upon consultation\r\nwith the two Senators, appointments should be made of fit men without\r\nregard to factions. To this Conkling refused his consent, stoutly\r\nobjecting to Robertson's appointment to any important office in this\r\ncountry. \"Conkling's behaviour in the interview,\" said President\r\nGarfield \"was so insolent that it was difficult for him to control\r\nhimself and keep from ordering him out of his presence.\"[1745] Conkling\r\nsays the President, on the Sunday preceding the appointment, informed\r\nhim \"that the collectorship of New York would be left for another\r\ntime.\"[1746] In a statement purporting to come from the President,\r\nJewell relates that when the five Stalwart nominations went to the\r\nSenate, Garfield was immediately burdened with letters and despatches\r\nin protest, coupled with the suggestion that everything had been\r\nsurrendered to Conkling, and that without delay or consultation he\r\nsent in Robertson's name. \"It was only an instance,\" says Boutwell,\r\n\"of General Garfield's impulsive and unreasoning submission to an\r\nexpression of public opinion, without waiting for evidence of the\r\nnature and value of that opinion.\"[1747]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1743: Boutwell, _Reminiscences of Sixty Years_, Vol. 2, p.\r\n274.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1744: New York _Tribune_, January 7, 1882.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1745: Hoar, _Autobiography_, Vol. 2, p. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1746: Boutwell, _Reminiscences_, Vol. 2, p. 273.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1747: _Ibid._, p. 274.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the country at large accepted it as a Blaine\r\ntriumph. Senators, especially those who had served in the House with\r\nthe President and his Secretary of State, had no doubt of it. Such a\r\ntremendously bold act was entirely foreign to Garfield's character.\r\nNor could it have but one meaning. The man who had split the New York\r\ndelegation for Blaine was to have his reward and to occupy the place\r\nof patronage and of power. More than that it was Blaine's long look\r\nahead. Such action required the highest order of political courage. It\r\nopened an old quarrel, it invited opposition, it challenged to battle.\r\nMen like Senator Frye of Maine, who had many times witnessed the\r\nresolution and dominating fearlessness of Blaine, knew that it was his\r\nact. \"For sixteen years,\" said Frye, \"the sting of Blaine's attack\r\nkept Conkling unfriendly. Besides, he had no confidence in him.\r\nWhenever reconciliation seemed imminent, it vanished like a\r\ncloud-shadow. I could never unite them. Blaine was ready, but Conkling\r\nwould accept no advances. When Robertson's appointment came he knew as\r\nwell as I that it was the act of Blaine.\"[1748] Depew, with whom Blaine\r\nhad conferred, took the same view. On the day after the nomination was\r\nsent in, Mrs. Blaine, rather exultingly and without any expression of\r\nsurprise, wrote her daughter of the incident. \"Your father has just\r\ngone to the Department. Did you notice the nominations sent in\r\nyesterday? They mean business and strength.\"[1749]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1748: Conversation with the author, December 7, 1908.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1749: Mrs. James G. Blaine, _Letters_ (March 24, 1881), Vol.\r\n1, p. 197.]\r\n\r\nBoutwell illustrates Conkling's lack of confidence in Blaine. After\r\nthe latter had become secretary of state he said to the Massachusetts\r\nSenator that Conkling was the only man who had had three elections to\r\nthe Senate, and that he and his friends would be considered fairly in\r\nthe New York appointments. \"When in conversation with Conkling, I\r\nmentioned Blaine's remark, he said, 'Do you believe one word of that?'\r\nI said, 'Yes, I believe Mr. Blaine.' He said with emphasis, 'I don't.'\r\nSubsequent events strengthened Mr. Conkling in his opinion.\"[1750]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1750: _Reminiscences_, Vol. 2, p. 273.]\r\n\r\nThe cordial relations apparently existing until then between the\r\nPresident and the Senator encouraged the hope that confirmation of\r\nthe nomination might not be opposed. Because of this feeling the New\r\nYork Legislature, by a formal resolution, endorsed it, and Republicans\r\ngenerally spoke not unkindly of it. But Conkling, knowing that though\r\nthe voice was Garfield's, the hand was Blaine's, quickly precipitated\r\na contest in which the interest of the whole country centred. It\r\nrecalled the Arthur controversy, renewed the feverish energy of\r\nStalwart and Half-breed, and furnished glimpses of the dramatic\r\ndiscord which stirred restlessly behind the curtains of Senate\r\nsecrecy. Under the rules of the Senate, Robertson's nomination went to\r\nthe Committee on Commerce, of which Conkling was chairman and in\r\ncontrol. Here the matter could be held in abeyance, at least until the\r\nStalwarts marshalled their influence to have it withdrawn. For this\r\npurpose Vice-President Arthur and Postmaster-General James called at\r\nthe White House. Governor Cornell, through a personal friend, sent a\r\nmessage to the President, declaring the nomination a great mistake and\r\nurging its withdrawal.[1751] Other distinguished men, including Senator\r\nAllison of Iowa, visited the President on a similar mission. When\r\nthese overtures failed compromises were suggested, such as making\r\nRobertson a Federal judge, a district attorney, a foreign minister, or\r\nthe solicitor general.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1751: Alfred R. Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, p. 637.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile assuring messages and comforting letters from Blaine's New\r\nYork friends stimulated Garfield's courage. On March 27, four days\r\nafter the nomination, Whitelaw Reid, the accomplished editor of the\r\n_Tribune_, telegraphed John Hay, in part, as follows: \"From\r\nindications here and at Albany we have concluded that the Conkling\r\nplan is: First, to make tremendous pressure on the President for\r\nwithdrawal of Robertson's name under threats from Conkling and\r\npersuasion from James. Second, if this fail, then to make their\r\nindignation useful by extorting from the President, as a means of\r\nplacating them, the surveyorship and naval office. With these two they\r\nthink they could largely neutralise Robertson. Cornell is believed\r\nwilling to acquiesce in Robertson, hoping to get other offices.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to say to the President in my judgment this is the turning\r\npoint of his whole administration--the crisis of his fate. If he\r\nsurrenders now Conkling is president for the rest of the term and\r\nGarfield becomes a laughing stock. On the other hand, he has only to\r\nstand firm to succeed. With the unanimous action of the New York\r\nLegislature, Conkling cannot make an effectual fight. That action came\r\nsolely from the belief that Garfield, unlike Hayes, meant to defend\r\nhis own administration. The Assembly is overwhelmingly Conkling, but\r\nthey did not dare go on the record against Robertson so long as they\r\nthought the Administration meant business. Robertson should be held\r\nfirm. Boldness and tenacity now insure victory. The least wavering\r\nwould be fatal.\"[1752]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1752: For full text of telegram see New York _Tribune_,\r\nJanuary 7, 1882. This confidential despatch found its way into the\r\npublic press. \"It must have been stolen from the wires,\" wrote Hay.\r\n\"Nobody but myself has ever seen it--not even Garfield. I read it to\r\nhim. It has been under lock and key ever since.\"--Mrs. James G.\r\nBlaine, _Letters_, Vol. 1, p. 286.]\r\n\r\nWhen Hay read this message to Garfield, the latter said, \"They may\r\ntake him out of the Senate head first or feet first; I will never\r\nwithdraw him.\"[1753] That the President might not weaken, Depew and\r\nother Independents spent much time in Washington during the\r\ncontroversy. \"The party standing of Blaine's New York supporters at\r\nChicago absolutely depended upon Robertson's confirmation,\" declared\r\nDepew.[1754]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1753: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1754: Conversation with the author, March 28, 1909.]\r\n\r\nConkling had not been idle. As usual he cast an anchor to the windward\r\nby coquetting with Democratic senators and soothing his Republican\r\ncolleagues.[1755] He knew how to control in caucus as well as in\r\ncommittee, and on May 2, the Republican senators appointed a Committee\r\nof Safety, which recommended that a majority decide the order of\r\nexecutive business including \"uncontested nominations.\" These\r\nnominations, it was explained, embraced such as were favourably\r\nreported by a committee or accepted by the Republican senators of the\r\nState from which the nominee hailed. In other words, the caucus action\r\npractically notified the President that no nomination would be\r\nconfirmed that did not please a senator, if a Republican. To exclude\r\nRobertson under such a rule it was only necessary that the New York\r\nsenators object to his confirmation. Immediately the press of the\r\ncountry teemed with protests. The Constitution, it declared, imposed a\r\nmoral obligation upon senators to confirm a nomination which was not\r\npersonally unfit or improper, or which did not imperil the public\r\ninterest, and it was puerile for a majority to agree in advance to\r\nrefuse to consider any nomination to which any member, for any reason\r\nwhatever, saw fit to object. Such a rule substantially transferred the\r\nExecutive power to one branch of Congress, making the President the\r\nagent of the Senate. It was \"senatorial courtesy\" run mad.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1755: \"If any Democratic senator is thinking only of New York\r\npolitics, and of the mere party relations of the pending question of\r\nPresidential nominations, the Democrats of New York must frankly tell\r\nhim that nothing but injury to the Democracy of New York has come or\r\ncan come of coalitions with Senator Conkling. The past is eloquent on\r\nthe subject. Whether set on foot by Mr. Tilden in 1873, or by Mr.\r\nKelly at a later date, Democratic coalitions with Mr. Conkling have\r\nbenefited only the Republicans. Mr. Tilden finally came to grief\r\nthrough them, and so did Mr. Kelly; and, what is more important, so\r\ndid the Democratic party.... It is high time that the false lights\r\nwhich Senator Conkling displayed to certain Democratic senators, and\r\nwith the help of whom the nominations of President Hayes were\r\nthwarted, should be understood. The chequered career of Senator\r\nConkling should compel cautious people to inquire carefully into the\r\nevidence for any declaration which may be made by him as to President\r\nGarfield and his undertaking.\"--New York _World_, April 1, 1881.]\r\n\r\nAs the days passed senators exhibited, under pressure from the country\r\nas well as from the White House, a growing desire to have the matter\r\nsettled, and as a final effort in the interest of harmony the\r\nCommittee of Safety itself called upon the President, proposing that\r\nhe withdraw Robertson's name and have the others confirmed. To this\r\nGarfield emphatically declined to accede. A few days later (May 5)\r\nVice-President Arthur and Senator Platt suggested that he withdraw all\r\nthe New York nominations. The President replied that he would\r\nwillingly withdraw all except Robertson's, and if the latter failed an\r\nentire new slate could then be made up. This did not satisfy, but\r\nwithin an hour after his visitors had departed, the President, to\r\nprevent the confirmation of some while Robertson's was left tied up in\r\ncommittee, put his suggestion into a message, withdrawing the names of\r\nthe five Stalwarts. This was another surprise, more alarming than the\r\nfirst, since it showed the Administration's readiness to fight.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Republican majority exhibited signs of disintegration.\r\nThe session was running into hot weather, Democrats had demonstrated\r\ntheir power to prevent a reorganisation of the Senate, and discord in\r\nRepublican States threatened disaster. Until recently Conkling had\r\nfelt sure of victory. But now, appreciating the delicacy of the\r\nsituation, he opened the caucus (May 9) with an earnest, conciliatory\r\nspeech. He disclaimed desiring any conflict with the President,\r\nagainst whom he made no accusations of bad faith; described the\r\nimpracticability of his sustaining any relations with Robertson, in\r\nwhose way, however, he would place no obstacle to any office other\r\nthan that of collector; discussed the danger to which a lack of\r\npolitical harmony would expose the party in New York; and in almost\r\npathetic tones urged that the courtesy of the Senate be not withheld\r\nfrom him in this hour of his extreme need.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that he had won the sympathy of his colleagues, but\r\nsucceeding caucuses, now held daily, lined his pathway with portents\r\nand warnings. The iron-clad rule ceased to be operative; a resolution\r\nto postpone action until the next session avoided defeat because\r\nhastily withdrawn; and a compromise, the last to be suggested,\r\nproposing confirmation on condition that Robertson then decline the\r\noffice, met with no favour. It was plain that at last the stress had\r\nreached a climax. Senators no longer exchanged their impressions, or\r\nasked \"How long?\" or \"What next?\" In their opinion either Garfield or\r\nConkling must recede, and they had learned that the President would\r\nnot. Moreover, it was rumored, after the caucus of May 13, that\r\nConkling had talked harshly, with much of the temper of a spoiled\r\nchild. As senators separated on that eventful Friday they declared\r\nwithout hesitation, though not without misgiving, that the last caucus\r\nhad been held and the last obstacle to Robertson's confirmation\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe position of Platt had at last become intolerable. Mindful of the\r\npromise to Depew and his friends he had tactfully and patiently sought\r\nto avoid a contest by satisfactorily arranging matters between the\r\nPresident and Conkling. Now the end of compromises had come and a vote\r\nimpended. At this critical if not desperate moment he suggested\r\nresignation.[1756] The Legislature that chose him in January was still\r\nin session, and the combined votes of the Stalwarts would be\r\nsufficient to re-elect them. This would liberate him from a promise\r\nand strengthen both with a legislative endorsement. It was neither an\r\nintrepid nor an exalted proposition, but Conkling accepted it.\r\nPerhaps his nature required a relief from its high-strung\r\nirritability in some sort of violence, and resignation backed by the\r\nassurance that he would soon be restored to office and to greater\r\npower on the shoulders of the party offered the seductive form which\r\nthat violence could take.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1756: \"I walked over to Conkling and said, 'I shall send my\r\nresignation to Governor Cornell to-night.' Conkling turned to me and\r\nreplied: 'Don't be too hasty about this matter, young man.' We then\r\nwent to the rear of the Senate Chamber and talked it over. Conkling\r\ninsisted that we should wait, and fight it out in Committee. I\r\nreplied, 'We have been so humiliated that there is but one thing for\r\nus to do--rebuke the President by immediately turning in our\r\nresignations and then appeal to the Legislature to sustain us.' I\r\ninduced Conkling to join me in offering our joint resignations, and\r\nthat night the papers were forwarded to Cornell by special messenger.\"\r\nPlatt's Reminiscences.--_Cosmopolitan Magazine_, April, 1909, p. 516.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Platt's opponents gave him the sobriquet of\r\n\"Me Too,\" meaning that he merely followed Conkling's lead. This was\r\nunjust to the junior Senator, who at least took the lead in suggesting\r\nand insisting upon resigning.]\r\n\r\nBefore the Senate reconvened on Monday (May 16) the resignation of\r\nConkling and Platt was in the hands of Governor Cornell. It came with\r\nthe suddenness of Robertson's nomination. Neither Vice-President\r\nArthur shared their intention, nor did Cornell suspect it. The first\r\nintimation came in two brief notes, read by the clerk, informing the\r\nSenate of their action. But the crash--the consternation, if any were\r\nanticipated, did not appear.[1757] No doubt many senators sincerely\r\nregretted the manner of Conkling's going, but that all were weary of\r\nhis restless predominance soon became an open secret.[1758] Nor did his\r\nreasons appeal to any one except as regarded his own personality and\r\npower, since the Senator's statement showed a deliberate, personal\r\nchoice, not based on a question of public policy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1757: \"The sensational resignations of Conkling and Platt\r\nproduce no excitement here (Washington), and I have yet to hear one\r\ncriticism complimentary of Conkling, though I have seen all sorts of\r\npeople and of every shade of cowardice.\"--Mrs. James G. Blaine,\r\n_Letters_ (May 17, 1881), Vol. 1, p. 199.\r\n\r\nRobertson and Merritt were promptly and unanimously confirmed on May\r\n18. Two days afterward the names of the five Stalwarts, which had been\r\nwithdrawn, were resubmitted, except those of Payn and Tyler.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1758: \"Conkling was unrelenting in his enmities. He used to\r\nget angry with men simply because they voted against him on questions\r\nin which he took an interest. Once he did not for months speak to\r\nJustin S. Morrill, one of the wisest and kindliest of men, because of\r\nhis pique at one of Merrill's votes.\"--George F. Hoar, _Autobiography_,\r\nVol. 2, p. 55.]\r\n\r\nStripped of its rhetoric and historicity the letter of Conkling and\r\nPlatt presented but two causes of complaint, one that the President,\r\nin withdrawing some of the New York nominations, tried to coerce the\r\nSenate to vote for Robertson; second, that Robertson, in voting and\r\nprocuring others to vote against Grant at Chicago, was guilty of \"a\r\ndishonest and dishonourable act.\"[1759] The poverty of these reasons\r\nexcited more surprise than the folly of their resignation.[1760] Every\r\none knew that in urging senators to say by their vote whether William\r\nH. Robertson was a fit person to be collector, the President kept\r\nstrictly within his constitutional prerogative, and that in\r\nwithdrawing the earlier nominations he exercised his undoubted right\r\nto determine the order in which he should ask the Senate's advice.\r\nMoreover, if any doubt ever existed as to Robertson's right to\r\nrepresent the sentiment of his district instead of the decree of the\r\nState convention, the national convention had settled it in his\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1759: The full text of the letter is published in the New\r\nYork papers of May 17, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1760: \"I was very much surprised at Senator Conkling's\r\naction,\" said Senator Frye of Maine, \"because of Judge Robertson's\r\npersonal hostility to him and not on account of his lack of fitness.\r\nDuring President Hayes' administration not an important appointment\r\nwas made in Maine to which Senators Blaine and Hamlin were not\r\nbitterly opposed. One man was appointed after Mr. Blaine had stated\r\nthat he was probably the only prominent Republican in the State\r\npersonally hostile to him. Yet, with a single exception, all were\r\nconfirmed, notwithstanding the opposition of the Maine Senators. But\r\nneither of them resigned. They were too good Republicans for\r\nthat.\"--New York _Tribune_, May 17, 1881.]\r\n\r\nConkling's friends are credited with having overborne his purpose,\r\nexpressed soon after the election of Garfield, to leave the Senate and\r\nengage in the practice of his profession.[1761] But that such\r\nintention did not influence his resignation was evidenced by the fact\r\nthat immediately afterward he bivouacked at Albany and sought a\r\nre-election. With his faithful lieutenants he constantly conferred,\r\nwhile the faithless ones, scarcely less conspicuous, who openly\r\nrefused their support, he stigmatised. From the first Cornell was an\r\nobject of distrust. He had wired Conkling advising Robertson's\r\nconfirmation, and the Senator crushed the telegram in his hand. This\r\nput the Governor into the disloyal class.[1762] It added to Conkling's\r\nirritation also that Cornell remained silent. The Governor's friends\r\nexpressed some surprise that the Senator did not suggest an interview.\r\nIt would have been much more surprising if he had, for it is doubtful\r\nif Conkling ever suggested an interview in his life. On the other\r\nhand, Cornell, unwilling to use the machinery of his great office to\r\nforce Conkling's return, did not care to approach the Senator. It was\r\nnot unknown, however, that he refused to become a candidate for United\r\nStates senator, and that, although ten or fifteen members continued to\r\nvote for him, he steadily encouraged his Stalwart friends not to\r\ndesert Conkling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1761: A.R. Conkling, _Life of Conkling_, p. 632.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1762: Conkling spoke of Cornell as \"The lizard on the\r\nhill.\"]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Legislature which elected Platt on January 18 was still\r\nin session, the sentiment dominating it had radically changed. The\r\nparty was deeply stirred. The Senator's sudden resignation had added\r\nto the indignation aroused by his opposition to the Administration,\r\nand members had heard from their constituents. Besides, a once\r\npowerful Senator was now a private citizen. At the outset Independents\r\nand several Stalwarts refused to enter a caucus, and early in the\r\ncontest the Democrats, marshalled by Manning, refused to come to the\r\nrescue. Thus, without organisation, Republicans began voting on May\r\n31. Seven weeks and four days later (July 22), after fifty-six\r\nballots, their work was concluded. The first ballot marked the highest\r\nscore for Conkling and Platt, the former receiving 39 and the latter\r\n29 out of 105 Republican votes.[1763] This severe comment upon their\r\ncourse plainly reflected the general sentiment of the party. It showed\r\nespecially the dissatisfaction existing toward Conkling. Yet a few\r\nStalwarts remained steadfast to the end. On the morning of July 1,\r\nwhen Platt, to the surprise of his friends, suddenly withdrew, he had\r\n28 votes. On July 22 Conkling had the same.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1763: The ballot resulted as follows: To succeed Platt (long\r\nterm), Thomas C. Platt, 29; Chauncey M. Depew, 21; Alonzo B. Cornell,\r\n12; Elbridge G. Lapham, 8; Warner Miller, 5; Richard Crowley, 3;\r\nscattering, 25. Francis Kernan (Dem.), 54. Total, 157.\r\n\r\nTo succeed Conkling (short term), Roscoe Conkling, 39; William A.\r\nWheeler, 19; Alonzo B. Cornell, 9; Richard Crowley, 5; Warner Miller,\r\n1; scattering 37. John C. Jacobs (Dem.), 53. Total, 159.]\r\n\r\nThe act of the assassin of President Garfield on the morning of July 2\r\nhad a visible effect upon the proceedings at Albany.[1764] Although\r\nfor a time conditions indicated that the distinguished sufferer might\r\nrecover, legislators evinced a great desire to conclude the\r\ndisagreeable work, and on July 5, sixty-six Republicans held a\r\nconference. Up to this time Depew had been the favourite for the long\r\nterm, registering fifty-five votes on the fourteenth ballot (June 14),\r\nbut in the interest of harmony he now withdrew his name.[1765]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1764: \"Suddenly the adherents of the murdered President saw\r\nthe powers of government about to be transferred to the leader of\r\ntheir defeated adversaries, and that transfer effected by the act of\r\nan assassin. Many of them could not instantly accept the truth that it\r\nwas the act solely of a half-crazed and disappointed seeker for\r\noffice; many of them questioned whether the men who were to profit by\r\nthe act were not the instigators of it.\"--From address of Elihu Root,\r\ndelivered at the unveiling of President Arthur's statue in Madison\r\nSquare, New York, June 13, 1899.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1765: On June 9, S.H. Bradley of Cattaraugus, made a\r\npersonal explanation in the Assembly, charging Loren B. Sessions, of\r\nthe Senate, with offering him $2,000 to cast his vote for Depew.\r\nSessions denied the charge. Investigation proved nothing, and an\r\nindictment, subsequently returned against Sessions, resulted in a\r\ntrial and an acquittal.]\r\n\r\nThis opened the way for Warner Miller, who received in caucus on the\r\nfifth ballot sixty-two of the sixty-six votes cast for the long term.\r\nBy previous agreement a Stalwart was entitled to the short term, and\r\nhad Cornell allowed his Stalwart friends to enter the caucus he might\r\nhave had the nomination. But he would not oppose Conkling. Moreover,\r\nthe belief obtained that the Democrats and Stalwarts would yet unite\r\nand adjourn the session without day, thus giving the Senator time to\r\nelect other friends to a new Legislature, and the Governor would not\r\ndisturb this hallucination. With Cornell out of the way Elbridge G.\r\nLapham easily won the nomination on the second ballot. Lapham had been\r\nthe first to desert Conkling, who now exclaimed, not without the\r\nbitter herb of truth: \"That man must not reap the reward of his\r\nperfidy.\"[1766]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1766: New York _Tribune_, July 7, 1881.]\r\n\r\nThe caucus did not at once bring union, but on July 12 Miller's vote\r\nreached seventy; on the 15th it registered seventy-four; and on the\r\n16th, with the help of Speaker Sharpe, who had encouraged Conkling's\r\ngoing to Albany, Miller was elected.[1767] Lapham's vote, however,\r\nhung fire until July 22, when, during a brief and most exciting\r\nconference in the Assembly Chamber, State Senator Halbert, the\r\nConkling Gibraltar, exclaimed with the suddenness of a squall at sea:\r\n\"We must come together or the party is divided in the State. I am\r\nwilling to vote now.\"[1768] Reason and good nature being thus\r\nrestored, each Republican present rose and voted his choice, Lapham\r\nreceiving sixty-one, Conkling twenty-eight. In the general rejoicing\r\nState Senator Pitts, a leader of the Independents, no doubt voiced the\r\nfeeling of all at that moment: \"I am as happy as Mr. Halbert. This\r\nnomination has been made good-naturedly. It is an augury of good\r\nfeeling in the future. New York proposes to stand by the Republican\r\nadministration. I hope we shall never hear more the words Stalwart,\r\nFeatherhead, Half-breed.\"[1769] When the joint convention again\r\nreassembled the fifty-sixth ballot gave Elbridge G. Lapham ninety-two,\r\nand Clarkson N. Potter, the new Democratic nominee, forty-two.[1770]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1767: \"At a conference held on May 22, at the house of\r\nChester A. Arthur, No. 123 Lexington Avenue, the following persons\r\nwere present: Chester A. Arthur, Thomas C. Platt, Louis F. Payn,\r\nCharles M. Denison, George H. Sharpe, John F. Smyth, A.B. Johnson, and\r\nRoscoe Conkling. Each person was asked to pass judgment upon the\r\nfuture course of the two Senators. Each one spoke in turn.

Sharpe went\r\nover to the opposition.\" Platt's Reminiscences.--_Cosmopolitan\r\nMagazine_, April, 1909, p. 517.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1768: New York papers of July 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1769: New York _Tribune_, July 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1770: The candidacy of John C. Jacobs had been the subject\r\nof some criticism on the part of the Democrats because he was a member\r\nof the Legislature, and on June 22, after the twenty-third ballot, he\r\nwithdrew. A caucus then substituted the name of Potter.]\r\n\r\nFor Conkling it was worse than defeat. The humiliation of having gone\r\nto Albany, of being deserted by friend after friend, of enduring the\r\ntaunts of an inhospitable press, and, finally, of having his place\r\ntaken by one, who, in his opinion, had proven most faithless, was like\r\nthe torture of an unquenchable fire. Lord Randolph Churchill, after\r\nhis historic resignation as chancellor of the exchequer, declared that\r\nhe would not live it over again for a million a year. It is likewise a\r\nmatter of history that Senator Conkling never ceased to deplore his\r\nmistake.[1771]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1771: Conkling at once resumed the practice of law in New\r\nYork City. The strain and exposure of making his way on foot through\r\nthe snowdrifts of the historic blizzard which visited that city in the\r\nspring of 1888, resulted in an abscess in the inner ear, from which he\r\ndied on April 18. A bronze statue, erected in his memory, is located\r\nin Madison Square.\r\n\r\n\"We have followed poor Conkling down to the gates of death and have\r\nbeen truly sorry to see them close upon him.

This classified him at once as a common\r\nenemy. In vain did he protest as Tweed had done against being made a\r\n\"scape-goat.\" His sentence was political death, and as a first step\r\ntoward its execution, Mayor Cooper refused to reappoint him\r\ncomptroller, an office which he had held for four years. Republican\r\naldermen joined in confirming his successor. Similar treatment,\r\naccorded his office-holding associates, stripped him of patronage\r\nexcept in the office of register.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1772: \"He wantonly sacrificed the Hancock ticket to his\r\nunscrupulous quest of local power.

They intend to punish him and make an example of him\r\nas a warning to bolting renegades and traitors.\"--New York _Herald_,\r\nNovember 5, 1880.]\r\n\r\nThen his Democratic opponents proposed depriving him of control in\r\nconventions, and having failed to reorganise him out of Tammany\r\n(April, 1881), they founded the County Democracy. William C. Whitney,\r\ncorporation counsel, Hubert O. Thompson, the young commissioner of\r\npublic works, and other leaders of similar character, heading a\r\nCommittee of One Hundred, became its inspiration. Under the Tammany\r\nsystem twenty-four men constituted the Committee on Organisation,\r\nwhile a few persons at any Assembly primary might represent all the\r\nvotes of the district. The new organisation proposed to make its\r\nCommittee on Organisation consist of six hundred and seventy-eight\r\nmembers and to place the control of all nominations in the hands of\r\nthe people. It was a catchy scheme and quickly became popular. To\r\ncarry it into effect a public enrolment was made of the Democratic\r\nvoters in each election district, who had an opportunity, by\r\nregistering their names, to join the Election District Committee. When\r\nthus affiliated each one could vote for a member of the Committee on\r\nOrganisation and for delegates to nominating conventions. On October 7\r\n(1881) Abram S. Hewitt, chairman of the Committee of One Hundred,\r\nissued an address, declaring that the organisation had 26,500 enrolled\r\nmembers, and had elected delegates to attend the State convention\r\nwhich met at Albany on October 11.\r\n\r\nKelly did not attend the convention. On his way from the depot to the\r\nhotel he found the air too chilly and the speech of people far from\r\ncomplimentary. It was plain, also, that the crushing defeat of Hancock\r\nhad obliterated factional division in the up-State counties and that\r\nDaniel E. Manning was in control. Nevertheless, Tammany's delegates,\r\nwithout the slightest resemblance to penitents, claimed regularity.\r\nThe convention answered that the County Democracy appeared upon the\r\npreliminary roll. To make its rebuff more emphatic Rufus W. Peckham,\r\nin presenting the report on contested seats, briefly stated that the\r\ncommittee, by a unanimous vote, found \"the gentlemen now occupying\r\nseats entitled to them by virtue of their regularity.\"[1773] Kelly's\r\nconceit did not blind his penetration to the fact that for the\r\npresent, at least, he had reached his end.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1773: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1881, p. 655.\r\n\r\nThe State ticket was as follows: Secretary of State, William Purcell,\r\nMonroe; Comptroller, George H. Lapham, Yates; Attorney-General,\r\nRoswell A. Parmenter, Rensselaer; Treasurer, Robert A. Maxwell,\r\nGenesee; Engineer, Thomas Evershed, Orleans; Judge, Court of Appeals,\r\nAugustus Schoonmaker, Ulster.]\r\n\r\nThe Republican convention (October 5) proved not less harmonious.\r\nArthur had become President (September 19),[1774] Conkling did not\r\nappear, and Warner Miller's surprising vote for temporary chairman\r\n(298 to 190), sustaining the verdict of the Legislature in the\r\nprolonged senatorial struggle, completely silenced the Stalwarts.\r\nConkling's name, presented as a contesting delegate from Oneida,\r\nprovoked no support, while Depew, whom the Senator a year earlier had\r\nsneeringly referred to as a \"creature of no influence,\" became\r\npermanent chairman without opposition. In the selection of State\r\ncandidates few organization men found favour.[1775] Finally, in their\r\noverconfidence the Independents carelessly postponed a resolution\r\nreorganising the party in New York City to an hour when their rural\r\nsupport had left the convention, and the most important business\r\nbefore it failed by five majority. \"Thus by sheer negligence,\" said\r\nGeorge William Curtis, \"the convention has left a formidable nucleus\r\nfor the reconstruction of the machine which had been overthrown.\"[1776]\r\nThe platform deplored the death of Garfield, expressed confidence in\r\nPresident Arthur, praised Cornell's wisdom, prudence, and economy, and\r\ninsisted upon equal taxation of corporations and individuals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1774: \"It was a common saying of that time among those who\r\nknew him best, '\"Chet\" Arthur, President of the United States! Good\r\nGod!'\"--White, _Autobiography_, Vol. 1, p. 193.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1775: The ticket was as follows: Secretary of State, Joseph\r\nB. Carr, Rensselaer; Comptroller, Ira Davenport, Steuben;\r\nAttorney-General, Leslie W. Russell, St. Lawrence; Treasurer, James W.\r\nHusted, Westchester; Engineer and Surveyor, Silas Seymour, Saratoga;\r\nJudge of the Court of Appeals, Francis M. Finch, Tompkins.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1776: _Harper's Weekly_, October 15.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the deep silence that characterised the October contest in\r\nOhio pervaded the campaign in New York, Republicans believed that\r\nPresident Arthur, by the moderation and dignity of his course, had\r\nfavourably impressed the public.[1777] His nomination of Postmaster\r\nGeneral James and the tender of the Treasury to Edwin D. Morgan\r\ncommanded universal approval. When Morgan declined, the nomination of\r\nCharles J. Folger, suggested by Morgan, added to his prestige. In\r\nfact, the most ardent champions of Garfield had taken little exception\r\nto the acts of the new Administration, and although Arthur's\r\nsupporters had suffered defeat in convention, it was inferred that the\r\nPresident and his friends sincerely desired the triumph of their\r\nparty. Moreover, the action of Tammany and the County Democracy in\r\nnominating separate local tickets had stimulated Republican\r\nconfidence. It meant that Kelly, in his inevitable desire to defeat\r\nhis enemy, would trade, combine, and descend to other underhand\r\njobbery, which usually benefited the opposite party.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1777: \"I dined at the President's on Wednesday. The dinner\r\nwas extremely elegant, hardly a trace of the old White House taint\r\nbeing perceptible anywhere, the flowers, the silver, the attendants,\r\nall showing the latest style and an abandon in expense and\r\ntaste.\"--Mrs. James G. Blaine, _Letters_ (March 13, 1882), Vol. 2, pp.\r\n4, 5.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the harmony blandly predicted did not appear. James W. Husted\r\nwas overwhelmingly defeated, while his party, for the first time in\r\ntwelve years, lost both branches of the Legislature.[1778] This\r\namazing disclosure exhibited the bitter animosity of faction. In\r\nAlbany, Erie, Oneida, and Oswego counties, Stalwart and Independent\r\nresolutely opposed each other, even to the point in some instances of\r\nsupporting the Democratic ticket.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1778: Plurality of Carr, secretary of state, 13,022. Other\r\nRepublicans had about the same, except Husted, whom Maxwell,\r\ntreasurer, defeated by 20,943. The Legislature stood: Senate,\r\nDemocrats, 17; Republicans, 15. Assembly, Democrats, 67; Republicans,\r\n61.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the County Democracy was exultant. In spite of the\r\ncombined opposition of Tammany and Irving Hall, the Whitney\r\norganisation carried the county by several thousand majority, securing\r\nfour of the seven senators, twelve of the twenty-four assemblymen, and\r\ntwelve of the twenty-two aldermen. This left Tammany absolutely\r\nwithout patronage. It was not unnatural that many of Kelly's\r\nco-workers should doubt the possibility of longer working harmoniously\r\nunder his leadership, and the great secession of prominent men from\r\nTammany after the formation of the County Democracy created little\r\nsurprise. But that the movement should include the rank and file was\r\nan astonishing revelation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Kelly, gathering up his three senators and eight\r\nassemblymen, carried the war to Albany. Strangely enough Republican\r\ndiscord had given him the balance of power in each legislative body,\r\nand until the Democrats acceded to his terms (February 2) the Assembly\r\nremained without a speaker.[1779] Two weeks later, upon the\r\nannouncement of the Assembly committees, Tammany, declaring its\r\nagreement violated, joined the Republicans in modifying the rules of\r\nthe Senate so as to permit the Lieutenant-Governor to appoint its\r\ncommittees and complete its organisation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1779: Kelly demanded the chairmanship of cities in both\r\nHouses, a satisfactory composition of the committees on railroads and\r\non commerce and navigation, a share in the subordinate offices, and\r\nthe exclusion of John C. Jacobs of Kings from the presidency of the\r\nSenate.]\r\n\r\nNo one knowing Kelly expected him to act otherwise. Nor can it be\r\nseriously doubted that he fully expected the Democracy, at the very\r\nnext opportunity, to make substantial concessions. At all events Kelly\r\npresented with great confidence Tammany's claims to representation in\r\nthe State convention which assembled at Syracuse on September 22\r\n(1882).[1780] He knew it was a critical moment for the Democracy. The\r\npoverty of the Republican majority in the preceding election, and the\r\nAdministration's highhanded efforts to defeat Cornell for\r\nrenomination, seemed to put the State within the grasp of a united\r\nparty. Yet the Tilden leaders, although divided among themselves,\r\nshrank from giving him power. This feeling was intensified by the\r\nrenewed activity of the old canal ring. The presence, too, of Stephen\r\nT. Arnot of Chemung, who served as a member of the Kelly State\r\nCommittee in 1879, added to their hostility. Indeed, so pronounced was\r\nthe resentment that on the first day of the convention Tammany was\r\nrefused tickets of admission.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1780: The Greenback-Labour party held its convention at\r\nAlbany on July 19, nominating Epenetus Howe of Tompkins, for governor.\r\nIt reaffirmed the principles of the party.\r\n\r\nA labour convention was held at Buffalo on September 12, but no\r\nnominations were made. It favored abolition of the contract-labour\r\nsystem in prisons; of cigar factories in tenements; of child labour\r\nunder fourteen; enforcement of the compulsory education act; reduction\r\nof labour to ten hours a day, etc.\r\n\r\nAn anti-monopoly convention assembled at Saratoga on September 13. No\r\nnominations were made. It demanded commissioners to supervise and\r\ncontrol corporation charges; advocated free canals; government\r\nownership of the telegraph; postal savings banks; discontinuance of\r\nrailroad grants; prohibition of combinations to control prices, etc.]\r\n\r\nBut behind Kelly stood the two leading candidates for governor.[1781]\r\nIn his canvass of the State Roswell P. Flower, hopeful of Kelly's\r\nsupport, had created a strong sentiment favourable to Tammany's\r\nadmission, while Henry W. Slocum, mindful of Tammany's dislike, had\r\nalso done what he could to smooth its way. Under such pressure the\r\nleaders, after recognising the County Democracy as the regular\r\norganisation with thirty-eight votes, gave Tammany twenty-four and\r\nIrving Hall ten.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1781: There were eight candidates for governor: Erastus\r\nCorning of Albany, Homer A. Nelson of Dutchess, Grover Cleveland of\r\nErie, Roswell P. Flower of Jefferson, Henry W. Slocum of Kings, and\r\nAllan Campbell, Waldo M. Hutchins, and Perry Belmont of New York.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this preliminary struggle did not clarify the gubernatorial\r\nsituation, it had the effect of materially weakening Flower. Of his\r\npopularity no doubt existed. As an industrious young man in Watertown\r\nhe had been a general favourite, and in New York, whither he went in\r\nearly manhood to take charge of his sister's property, left by her\r\nmillionaire husband, he became the head of a prosperous banking house\r\nand the friend of all classes. The liberality of his charities\r\nequalled the splendour of his social entertainments, while a few\r\nmonths in Congress as the successor of Levi P. Morton and the\r\nsuccessful opponent of William W. Astor, had introduced him to the\r\nvoters of the metropolis. He was now forty-four years old, with ample\r\nwealth, a wide acquaintance, and surrounded by scores of experienced\r\npolitical diplomats.\r\n\r\nBut Manning distrusted Flower. Back of him were Arnot, DeWolf, and\r\nother anti-Tilden leaders. He also deeply resented Flower's support of\r\nKelly. It gave the Boss a new lease of power and practically paralysed\r\nall efforts to discipline him. Besides, it betrayed an indisposition\r\nto seek advice of the organisation and an indifference to political\r\nmethods. He seemed to be the rich man in politics, relying for control\r\nupon money rather than political wisdom. Nor did it improve Flower's\r\nchances among the country delegates that one of the convention\r\nspeakers thought him guided by Jay Gould, in whose questionable deals\r\nhe had generously participated.\r\n\r\nSlocum had likewise sinned. Manning thought well of the distinguished\r\nsoldier whom he promised one hundred votes, which he delivered. But\r\nhis support of Kelly had been distasteful to the County Democracy.\r\nBesides, he was charged with voting, when in Congress, for the \"salary\r\ngrab,\" and one delegate, speaking on the floor of the convention,\r\ndeclared that as a trustee of the Brooklyn Bridge, \"Slocum would be\r\nheld responsible for the colossal frauds connected with its\r\nerection.\"[1782] It added to the chaos of the situation that Flower's\r\nsupporters resented Slocum's activity, while Slocum's friends excepted\r\nto the County Democracy's use of Allan Campbell as a stalking horse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1782: New York _Tribune_, September 23.]\r\n\r\nGrover Cleveland's candidacy seemed not very important. He was not\r\nwholly unknown throughout the State. Lawyers recognised him as a\r\nprominent member of the profession, and politicians knew him as\r\nsheriff of Erie County in the early seventies and as the recently\r\nelected mayor of Buffalo. But people outside the Lake city knew\r\nnothing of his character for stubborn independence, uncompromising\r\nhonesty, and fearless devotion to duty. His friends tried to tell the\r\ndelegates that he insisted upon public officials treating the people's\r\nmoney as its trustees, and that he had promptly vetoed every departure\r\nfrom this rule. They claimed also that he could neither be coaxed nor\r\nconstrained into the approval of men or measures that were not honest\r\nand proper, citing several illustrations that had greatly gratified\r\nand aroused his home people. This was the gist of Daniel N. Lockwood's\r\nshort, happy, and forceful speech in presenting his name to the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nBut such recommendations of candidates were not unusual, and although\r\nErie and the surrounding counties mustered fifty or sixty votes, no\r\nmovement toward Cleveland existed other than that growing out of the\r\npeculiar political situation. If Slocum and Flower failed, Nelson or\r\nCorning might benefit. Edward Murphy of Rensselaer, then mayor of Troy\r\nfor the fourth term and closely associated with Manning in leadership,\r\nrepresented Corning with spirit, while the Dutchess friends of Homer\r\nA. Nelson exhibited their devotion by an energetic canvass. Yet\r\nCleveland possessed one strategic point stronger than either of them.\r\nHis absolute freedom from the political antagonisms of New York and\r\nKing counties commended him to the County Democracy. This organisation\r\nof extraordinary leadership had tired of deals and quarrels. The\r\nhammering of Tilden, the sacrifice of Robinson, the defeat of Hancock,\r\nand the hold-up in the last Legislature made a new departure\r\nnecessary, and it may be said with truth and without injustice that\r\nthe night before the convention opened the nomination of Cleveland, if\r\nit could be accomplished, seemed to the County Democracy the wisest\r\nand safest result.\r\n\r\nWhen the roll-call began Kelly, playing for position, divided\r\nTammany's vote among the possible winners, giving Flower seven, Slocum\r\nsix, Cleveland six, and Corning five. The County Democracy voted for\r\nCampbell. Corning's withdrawal and large secessions from Nelson and\r\nBelmont sent Slocum and Flower far in the lead on the second ballot,\r\nwhile Cleveland moved up five points with the help of Kelly and\r\nothers. The County Democracy again voted for Campbell. On the third\r\nballot a break was inevitable. Hutchins had remained stationary,\r\nNelson and Belmont were practically out of the race, and Slocum and\r\nFlower stood even. It was now in the power of the County Democracy to\r\nnominate Slocum. Manning approved it and Murphy had already given him\r\nthe Corning vote. But the County Democracy, inspired by men of\r\nprescience and of iron nerve, went to Cleveland in a body, making the\r\nhall resound with cheers. Had Tammany, the next delegation called,\r\nfollowed suit, Kelly might have divided with his opponents the honour\r\nof Cleveland's nomination. Instead, it practically voted as before.\r\nBut Albany, Rensselaer, and other counties, catching the tide at its\r\nturn, threw the convention into a bedlam. Finally, when Kelly could\r\nsecure recognition, he changed Tammany's vote to Cleveland.\r\n\r\nTo the tally-clerks Cleveland's nomination by two majority was known\r\nbefore the completion of the ballot. Yet upon the insistence of the\r\nSlocum men, because of confusion in making changes, the convention\r\nrefused to receive the result and ordered another roll-call. This gave\r\nCleveland eighteen votes to spare.[1783]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1783: Whole number of votes, 385; necessary to a choice,\r\n193. First ballot: Slocum, 98; Flower, 97; Cleveland, 66; Corning, 35;\r\nCampbell, 37; Nelson, 26; Belmont, 12; Hutchins, 13. Second ballot:\r\nSlocum, 123; Flower, 123; Cleveland, 71; Campbell, 33; Nelson, 15;\r\nBelmont, 6; Hutchins, 13. Third ballot: Slocum, 156; Flower, 15;\r\nCleveland, 211.]\r\n\r\nThe result brought the Democrats into perfect accord for the first\r\ntime in many years. It had come without the exercise of illegitimate\r\ninfluences or the incurrence of personal obligation. To no one in\r\nparticular did Cleveland owe his nomination. Besides, his success as a\r\npolitician, his character as a public official, and his enthusiastic\r\ndevotion to the clients whose causes he championed, challenged the\r\nmost careful scrutiny. He was then unmarried, forty-four years old,\r\ntall, stoutly-built, with a large head, dark brown hair, clear keen\r\neyes, and a generous and kindly nature concealed under a slightly\r\nbrusque manner. His sturdy old-fashioned rectitude, and the just\r\nconviction that by taste and adaptability for public life he had\r\npeculiar qualifications for the great office of governor, commended\r\nhim to popular confidence. In Buffalo, where he had lived for a\r\nquarter of a century, people knew him as a man without guile.\r\n\r\nTwo days before Cleveland's nomination (September 20), the Republicans\r\nhad selected Charles J. Folger, then secretary of the treasury. In\r\ncharacter for honesty and ability the two men were not dissimilar, but\r\nthe manner of their selection was antipodal. Of the five candidates\r\nwho appealed to the convention, Cornell was the only real opponent of\r\nthe Secretary.[1784] For more than a year, ever since he took office,\r\nin fact, Cornell had counted upon a renomination. He cleverly\r\nstrengthened the State machine, surrounded himself with able\r\nlieutenants, and never failed to make appointments promotive of his\r\nambition. The confirmation of Isaac V. Baker as superintendent of\r\nprisons with the aid of Tammany's three senators, especially\r\nillustrated his skill in reaching men. But he had done more than\r\norganise. His numerous vetoes called attention to his discriminating\r\nwork, indicating honesty, efficiency, activity in promoting the\r\npeople's interests, and fidelity to Republican principles. An honest\r\npublic sentiment recognised these good features of his work. Indeed,\r\nhis administration admittedly ranked with the best that had adorned\r\nthe State for a century, and his friends, including Independents and\r\nmany Stalwarts, rallied with energy to his support. It was known, too,\r\nthat the wisdom of Blaine permeated his councils.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1784: The candidates were Charles J. Folger, Alonzo B.\r\nCornell, James W. Wadsworth of Genesee, John H. Starin of New York,\r\nand John C. Robinson of Broome.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Conkling and the President marked him for defeat. It was\r\nnotorious that their hostility grew out of the Governor's passivity in\r\nthe senatorial election, Arthur feeling the humiliation of that defeat\r\nscarcely less than Conkling, while memories of Crowley's failure and\r\nof the Governor's exultation had not faded. Conkling, not less bitter,\r\nhad more recent cause for resentment. As the attorney of Jay Gould he\r\nhad indicated a willingness to forgive and forget the past if the\r\nGovernor would approve legislation favourable to the Gould properties.\r\nBut Cornell, satisfied of its unfairness, courageously refused.[1785]\r\nWhen he did so he knew and subsequently declared, that if he had\r\nsigned the bill, neither Gould nor Conkling would have opposed his\r\nrenomination.[1786]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1785: The bill provided that the elevated railroad companies\r\nof New York should, in lieu of other public charges, pay a tax of four\r\nper cent. on their gross receipts. As first submitted the bill had the\r\napproval of the mayor and comptroller of the city, but after its\r\nmodification they withdrew their approval and opposed its passage on\r\nthe ground that it unjustly discriminated in favour of these\r\nparticular corporations and deprived the city of a large amount of\r\nrevenue.--Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1882, p. 600.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1786: Albany _Evening Journal_, August 20, 1882.]\r\n\r\nFor these purely personal reasons an extraordinary situation was\r\ncreated, revealing the methods of purse and patronage by which the\r\nGould-Conkling combine and the Administration got revenge. In their\r\nefforts in Folger's behalf delegates were coerced, and efficient\r\nofficials at Albany, Brooklyn, Utica, and Ogdensburg, removed in the\r\nmiddle of their terms, were replaced by partisans of the President.\r\nEven after the patronage packed convention assembled the questionable\r\nmethods continued. Gould's agent hovered about Saratoga. To secure the\r\nselection of a temporary chairman by the State committee, Stephen B.\r\nFrench, an intimate of Arthur, presented a fraudulent proxy to\r\nrepresent William H. Robertson.[1787] Had the convention known this\r\nat the moment of voting swift defeat must have come to the\r\nAdministration, which barely escaped (251 to 243) by getting\r\npostmasters into line.[1788]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1787: French presented a telegram to the secretary of the\r\nState committee purporting to be sent from New York by Robertson. An\r\ninvestigation made later showed that the message was written in Albany\r\non a sender's blank and had not been handled by the telegraph company.\r\nFrench explained that he had wired Robertson for a proxy, and when\r\nhanded the message supposed it to be an answer. It was plain, however,\r\nthat the telegram to Robertson and his alleged answer were parts of\r\nthe same scheme.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1788: New York _Times_, September 22; see also the _Nation_,\r\nOctober 5; _Harper's Weekly_, October 14 and 21; New York _Sun_,\r\nSeptember 22; Albany _Evening Journal_, September 22.]\r\n\r\nThe candidacy of James W. Wadsworth, son of the famous general, and\r\nrecently state-comptroller, likewise became a decoy for Folger.\r\nWadsworth himself had no understanding with that wing. He was\r\nabsolutely independent and unpledged. But the Stalwarts, in districts\r\nopposed to them, promoted the choice of such so-called Wadsworth\r\ndelegates as could be captured by the persuasive plea for harmony, and\r\nunder the stress of the second ballot, when Starin's and Robinson's\r\nsupport broke to Cornell, some of them voted for Folger. This gave the\r\nAdministration's candidate eight more than the required number.[1789]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1789: Whole number of votes, 447. Necessary to a choice,\r\n249. First ballot: Folger, 223; Cornell, 180; Wadsworth, 69; Starin,\r\n19; Robinson, 6. Second ballot: Folger, 257; Cornell, 222; Wadsworth,\r\n18.\r\n\r\nThe ticket was as follows: Governor, Charles J. Folger, Ontario;\r\nLieutenant-Governor, B. Platt Carpenter, Dutchess; Chief Judge of\r\nAppeals, Charles Andrews, Onondaga; Congressman-at-large, A. Barton\r\nHepburn, St. Lawrence. Subsequently, Howard Carroll of New York, was\r\nsubstituted for Hepburn.]\r\n\r\nThe belated platform, fulsomely eulogistic of Cornell, added to the\r\nindignation of the Independents, since it seemed a mockery to present\r\nwhat the Stalwarts did not offer until after a nomination. It gave\r\nstill greater offence when the State Committee selected John F. Smyth\r\nas its chairman to conduct the campaign.[1790]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1790: \"Look at John F. Smyth and B. Platt Carpenter. Instead\r\nof being at the head of the whole business, they should be at the tail\r\nor out of sight.\"--From speech of Theodore F. Pomeroy, the _Nation_,\r\nOctober 5.]\r\n\r\n\"It is hardly worth while analysing the influences which have\r\ncontributed to this result,\" said the New York _Times_. \"The fact is\r\nplain that the Gould-Conkling combination, backed by the power of the\r\nFederal Administration, has accomplished what it set out to do.\"[1791]\r\nHenry Ward Beecher in a Sunday evening sermon, said that \"When Cornell\r\nwent out, Avarice and Revenge kissed each other.\" Theodore L. Cuyler,\r\nthen pastor of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn,\r\ndeclared that he \"stood by the cradle of the Republican party, but\r\nwhen it shunted off on the wrong track I will not go over the\r\nprecipice with it.\"[1792] In hastening to deny that _Harper's Weekly_\r\nwould support Folger, George William Curtis wrote: \"Judge Folger's\r\nability and character are not in question, but his nomination is. That\r\nnomination was procured by the combined power of fraud and patronage,\r\nand to support it would be to acquiesce in them as legitimate forces\r\nin a convention.\"[1793] The Buffalo _Express_, a vigorous and\r\nindependent Republican journal, also bolted the ticket,[1794] an\r\nexample followed by several other papers of similar character\r\nthroughout the State. After the lapse of a fortnight, Hepburn,\r\ncandidate for congressman-at-large, declined to accept because \"it is\r\nquite apparent that a very large portion of the Republicans, owing to\r\nthe unfortunate circumstances which have come to light since the\r\nadjournment of the convention, are not disposed to accept its\r\nconclusion as an authoritative utterance of the party.\"[1795]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1791: September 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1792: The _Nation_, October 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1793: New York _Tribune_, October 4.\r\n\r\n\"By one of those curious blunders to which editorial offices are\r\nliable in the absence of the responsible head, an article by Mr.\r\nCurtis was modified to commit the paper to the support of the\r\ncandidate. Curtis resigned the editorship. It was promptly and in the\r\nmost manly manner disavowed by the house of Harper & Bros.\"--Edward\r\nCary, _Life of Curtis_, p. 275.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1794: September 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1795: New York daily papers, October 4.]\r\n\r\nFolger was not suspected of any personal complicity with unfair\r\ndealing, but the deep and general Republican dissatisfaction greatly\r\ndisturbed him. His friends urged him to withdraw. Stewart L. Woodford,\r\nthen United States attorney, insisted that fraud and forgery vitiated\r\nall the convention did, and that the \"short, direct, and honourable\r\nway out of it was to refuse the nomination.\"[1796] The Kings County\r\nexecutive committee assured him that many influential Republicans\r\nconsidered this the wisest course. From prominent men in all parts of\r\nthe State came similar advice. This view appealed to his own better\r\njudgment, and he had decided so to act until persuaded otherwise by\r\nthe pleadings of the Stalwarts.[1797] His acceptance, recalling the\r\nTilden letter of 1880, was a touching appeal to the voters. Referring\r\nto the fraudulent practices, he said: \"No one claims, no one believes,\r\nthat I had lot or part therein, or previous hint or suspicion thereof.\r\nI scorn an end to be got by such means. I will not undertake to\r\nmeasure the truth of all these reports; that of one is beyond\r\ndispute.\"[1798] Nevertheless, Folger could not deny that he was a\r\nwilling recipient of that \"one,\" through the influence of which, by\r\ncreating the impression that Robertson and other anti-Administration\r\nleaders favoured the Stalwart's choice of a temporary chairman, he\r\ngained a much greater power in the convention than his eight majority\r\nrepresented.[1799]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1796: New York _Times_, September 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1797: Albany _Evening Journal_, October 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1798: Folger's letter is found in the daily papers of\r\nOctober 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1799: It was generally known that this influence changed the\r\nvotes of two acting State committeemen, who had agreed to act with the\r\nCornell men.--See the _Nation_ of October 5; also the New York\r\n_Tribune_, October 4.]\r\n\r\nIn accepting the Democratic nomination Cleveland had the great\r\nadvantage of not being obliged to refer to anything of which he was\r\nashamed. Its tone was simple, sober, and direct, and from the\r\nprinciples expressed, the measures advocated, or the language\r\nemployed, the reader could form no idea to what party the writer\r\nbelonged. He desired primary elections to be \"uncontaminated and\r\nfairly conducted\"; condemned the interference of \"officials of any\r\ndegree, State or Federal, for the purpose of thwarting or controlling\r\nthe popular wish\"; favoured tenure of office in the civil service\r\nbeing dependent upon \"ability and merit\"; and denounced the levying of\r\npolitical assessments, declaring \"the expenditure of money to\r\ninfluence the action of the people at the polls or to secure\r\nlegislation is calculated to excite the gravest concern.\"[1800]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1800: Cleveland's letter appears in the press of October\r\n10.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign became historic because it revealed the most serious\r\ndisturbance in the Republican party since the war. Little was heard\r\nsave apology, indignant protest, and appeal to tradition. Whatever\r\nRepublican hope existed was based upon the unworthiness of the\r\nDemocratic party. In a letter to an Albany meeting Folger declared,\r\nafter highly praising his opponent, that \"There is one difference\r\nwhich goes to the root of the matter when we are brought to view as\r\npublic men and put forward to act in public affairs. He is a Democrat.\r\nI am a Republican.\" Then, becoming an alarmist, he referred to the\r\nshrinkage in the value of stocks on the day after the Democratic\r\nvictory in Ohio. \"That shrinkage has been going on ever since,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Do the business interests of the country dread a return of the\r\nDemocratic party to power? Will the election of Cleveland increase it?\r\nThese are questions for hesitating Republicans to ponder.\"[1801] This\r\nStock Exchange view of politics, redolent of the operations of brokers\r\nin Wall Street, did not help the Republican candidate. Curtis thought\r\nit, coming from the Secretary of the Treasury, \"most extraordinary.\"[1802]\r\nBesides, the decline in the stock market began before the Ohio\r\nelection, when conditions indicated Republican success.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1801: Albany _Evening Journal_, October 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1802: _Harper's Weekly_, November 4.]\r\n\r\nThe local campaign in the metropolis assumed more life. In spite of\r\nits avowed purpose to rid the city of dishonest political tricksters,\r\nthe County Democracy made bedfellows of Tammany and Irving Hall, and\r\nnominated Franklin Edson for mayor. This union was the more offensive\r\nbecause in its accomplishment the Whitney organisation turned its back\r\nupon Allan Campbell, its choice for governor, whom a Citizens'\r\nCommittee, with Republican support, afterwards selected for mayor.\r\nCampbell as city-comptroller was familiar with municipal affairs, and\r\nof the highest integrity, independence, and courage. His friends\r\nnaturally resented the indignity, and for ten days an effective\r\ncanvass deeply stirred New York.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Republican party was doomed. Managers beckoned hope\r\nby frequent assertions, sometimes in the form of bulletins, that the\r\nindignation was subsiding. Smyth and his State Committee disclaimed\r\nany part in the wrong-doing by expressing, in the form of a\r\nresolution, their \"detestation of the forged proxy, and of all the\r\nmethods and purposes to which such wretched fraud and treachery\r\napply.\"[1803] Even the nominee for lieutenant-governor argued that he\r\nwas an honest man. But the people had their own opinion, and a count\r\nof the votes showed that Folger, in spite of his pure and very useful\r\nlife, had been sacrificed,[1804] while Cleveland had a majority\r\ngreater than was ever known in a contested State election. It was so\r\nastounding that Democrats themselves did not claim it, in the usual\r\nsense, as a Democratic victory.[1805] Everybody recognised it as a\r\nrebuke to Executive dictation and corrupt political methods. But no\r\none denied that Cleveland helped swell the majority. He became known\r\nas the \"Veto Mayor,\" and the history of his brief public life was\r\ncommon knowledge. His professional career, unlike Tilden's, disclosed\r\nno dark spots. He had been an honest lawyer as well as an upright\r\npublic official, and the people believed that his stubborn\r\nindependence and sturdy integrity would make him a real governor, the\r\nenemy of rings and bosses, and the foe of avarice and revenge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1803: Appleton's _Cyclopædia_, 1882, p. 608.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1804: \"It will be two weeks to-morrow since I dined with\r\nJudge Howe, the postmaster-general, going out to the table with him,\r\nand here he is dead! Poor Arthur, he will find the Presidency more\r\ngruesome with a favourite cabinet minister gone! If it were Folger\r\nnow, I suppose he would not care, for they really do not know what to\r\ndo with him.\"--Mrs. James G.
