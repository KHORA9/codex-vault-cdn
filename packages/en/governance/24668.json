These pages may be said to picture\r\nnot only official phases of the great crisis, but also the highest\r\nsignificance of liberty and democracy and the reactions of President\r\nand people to the great developments of the times. The second\r\nInaugural Address with its sense of solemn responsibility serves as a\r\nprophecy as well as prelude to the declaration of war and the message\r\nto the people which followed so soon.\r\n\r\nThe extracts from the Conscription Proclamation, the messages on\r\nConservation and the Fixing of Prices, the Appeal to Business\r\nInterests, the Address to the Federation of Labor and the Railroad\r\nmessages present the solid every-day realities and the vast\r\nresponsibilities of war-time as they affect every American. These are\r\nconcrete messages which should be at hand for frequent reference,\r\njust as the uplift and inspiration of lofty appeals like the Memorial\r\nDay and Flag Day addresses should be a constant source of\r\ninspiration. There are also the clarifying and vigorous definitions\r\nof American purpose afforded in utterances like the statement to\r\nRussia, the reply to the communication of the Pope, and, most\r\nemphatically, the President's restatement of War Aims on January 8th.\r\nThese and other state papers from the early spring of 1917 to\r\nJanuary, 1918, have a significance and value in this collected form\r\nwhich has been attested by the many requests that have come to Harper\r\n& Brothers, as President Wilson's publishers, for a war volume of the\r\nPresident's messages to follow _Why We Are At War_.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, the President has been consulted in regard to\r\nthe plan of publication, and the conditions which he requested have\r\nbeen observed. For title, arrangement, headings, and like details the\r\npublishers are responsible. They have held the publication of the\r\nPresident's words of enlightenment and inspiration to be a public\r\nservice. And they think that there is no impropriety in adding that\r\nin the case of this book, and _Why We Are At War_, the American\r\nRed Cross receives all author's royalties.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the former book the evolution of events which led to\r\nwar was illustrated in messages from January to April 15th. In the\r\npreparation of this book, which begins with the second inaugural, it\r\nhas seemed desirable to present practically all the messages of\r\nwar-time, and therefore three papers are included which appeared in\r\nthe former and smaller book, in addition to the twenty-one messages\r\nand addresses which have been collected for this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN OUR FIRST YEAR OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN OUR FIRST YEAR OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\n(_March 5, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow-citizens,--The four years which have elapsed since last I\r\nstood in this place have been crowded with counsel and action of the\r\nmost vital interest and consequence. Perhaps no equal period in our\r\nhistory has been so fruitful of important reforms in our economic and\r\nindustrial life or so full of significant changes in the spirit and\r\npurpose of our political action. We have sought very thoughtfully to\r\nset our house in order, correct the grosser errors and abuses of our\r\nindustrial life, liberate and quicken the processes of our national\r\ngenius and energy, and lift our politics to a broader view of the\r\npeople's essential interests. It is a record of singular variety and\r\nsingular distinction. But I shall not attempt to review it. It speaks\r\nfor itself and will be of increasing influence as the years go by.\r\nThis is not the time for retrospect. It is time, rather, to speak our\r\nthoughts and purposes concerning the present and the immediate\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COSMOPOLITAN EPOCH AT HAND\r\n\r\nAlthough we have centered counsel and action with such unusual\r\nconcentration and success upon the great problems of domestic\r\nlegislation to which we addressed ourselves four years ago, other\r\nmatters have more and more forced themselves upon our attention,\r\nmatters lying outside our own life as a nation and over which we had\r\nno control, but which, despite our wish to keep free of them, have\r\ndrawn us more and more irresistibly into their own current and\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible to avoid them. They have affected the life of\r\nthe whole world. They have shaken men everywhere with a passion and\r\nan apprehension they never knew before. It has been hard to preserve\r\ncalm counsel while the thought of our own people swayed this way and\r\nthat under their influence. We are a composite and cosmopolitan\r\npeople. We are of the blood of all the nations that are at war. The\r\ncurrents of our thoughts as well as the currents of our trade run\r\nquick at all seasons back and forth between us and them. The war\r\ninevitably set its mark from the first alike upon our minds, our\r\nindustries, our commerce, our politics, and our social action. To be\r\nindifferent to it or independent of it was out of the question.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part of\r\nit. In that consciousness, despite many divisions, we have drawn\r\ncloser together. We have been deeply wronged upon the seas, but we\r\nhave not wished to wrong or injure in return; have retained\r\nthroughout the consciousness of standing in some sort apart, intent\r\nupon an interest that transcended the immediate issues of the war\r\nitself. As some of the injuries done us have become intolerable, we\r\nhave still been clear that we wished nothing for ourselves that we\r\nwere not ready to demand for all mankind,--fair dealing, justice, the\r\nfreedom to live and be at ease against organized wrong.\r\n\r\nIt is in this spirit and with this thought that we have grown more\r\nand more aware, more and more certain that the part we wished to play\r\nwas the part of those who mean to vindicate and fortify peace. We\r\nhave been obliged to arm ourselves to make good our claim to a\r\ncertain minimum of right and of freedom of action. We stand firm in\r\narmed neutrality since it seems that in no other way we can\r\ndemonstrate what it is we insist upon and cannot forego. We may even\r\nbe drawn on, by circumstances, not by our own purpose or desire, to a\r\nmore active assertion of our rights as we see them and a more\r\nimmediate association with the great struggle itself. But nothing\r\nwill alter our thought or our purpose. They are too clear to be\r\nobscured. They are too deeply rooted in the principles of our\r\nnational life to be altered. We desire neither conquest nor\r\nadvantage. We wish nothing that can be had only at the cost of\r\nanother people. We have always professed unselfish purpose and we\r\ncovet the opportunity to prove that our professions are sincere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF CO-OPERATION\r\n\r\nThere are many things still to do at home, to clarify our own\r\npolitics and give new vitality to the industrial processes of our own\r\nlife, and we shall do them as time and opportunity serve; but we\r\nrealize that the greatest things that remain to be done must be done\r\nwith the whole world for stage and in co-operation with the wide and\r\nuniversal forces of mankind, and we are making our spirits ready for\r\nthose things. They will follow in the immediate wake of the war\r\nitself and will set civilization up again. We are provincials no\r\nlonger. The tragical events of the thirty months of vital turmoil\r\nthrough which we have just passed have made us citizens of the world.\r\nThere can be no turning back. Our own fortunes as a nation are\r\ninvolved, whether we would have it so or not.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we are not the less Americans on that account. We shall be\r\nthe more American if we but remain true to the principles in which we\r\nhave been bred. They are not the principles of a province or of a\r\nsingle continent. We have known and boasted all along that they were\r\nthe principles of a liberated mankind. These, therefore, are the\r\nthings we shall stand for, whether in war or in peace:\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR NATIONAL PLATFORM\r\n\r\nThat all nations are equally interested in the peace of the world and\r\nin the political stability of free peoples, and equally responsible\r\nfor their maintenance;\r\n\r\nThat the essential principle of peace is the actual equality of\r\nnations in all matters of right or privilege;\r\n\r\nThat peace cannot securely or justly rest upon an armed balance of\r\npower;\r\n\r\nThat Governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned and that no other powers should be supported by the common\r\nthought, purpose or power of the family of nations;\r\n\r\nThat the seas should be equally free and safe for the use of all\r\npeoples, under rules set up by common agreement and consent, and\r\nthat, so far as practicable, they should be accessible to all upon\r\nequal terms;\r\n\r\nThat national armaments should be limited to the necessities of\r\nnational order and domestic safety;\r\n\r\nThat the community of interest and of power upon which peace must\r\nhenceforth depend imposes upon each nation the duty of seeing to it\r\nthat all influences proceeding from its own citizens meant to\r\nencourage or assist revolution in other states should be sternly and\r\neffectually suppressed and prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\nA UNITY OF PURPOSE AND ACTION\r\n\r\nI need not argue these principles to you, my fellow-countrymen: they\r\nare your own, part and parcel of your own thinking and your own\r\nmotive in affairs. They spring up native amongst us. Upon this as a\r\nplatform of purpose and of action we can stand together.\r\n\r\nAnd it is imperative that we should stand together. We are being\r\nforged into a new unity amidst the fires that now blaze throughout\r\nthe world. In their ardent heat we shall, in God's providence, let us\r\nhope, be purged of faction and division, purified of the errant\r\nhumors of party and of private interest, and shall stand forth in the\r\ndays to come with a new dignity of national pride and spirit. Let\r\neach man see to it that the dedication is in his own heart, the high\r\npurpose of the nation in his own mind, ruler of his own will and\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nI stand here and have taken the high and solemn oath to which you\r\nhave been audience because the people of the United States have\r\nchosen me for this august delegation of power and have by their\r\ngracious judgment named me their leader in affairs. I know now what\r\nthe task means. I realize to the full the responsibility which it\r\ninvolves. I pray God I may be given the wisdom and the prudence to do\r\nmy duty in the true spirit of this great people. I am their servant\r\nand can succeed only as they sustain and guide me by their confidence\r\nand their counsel. The thing I shall count upon, the thing without\r\nwhich neither counsel nor action will avail, is the unity of\r\nAmerica--an America united in feeling, in purpose, and in its vision\r\nof duty, of opportunity, and of service. We are to beware of all men\r\nwho would turn the tasks and the necessities of the nation to their\r\nown private profit or use them for the building up of private power;\r\nbeware that no faction or disloyal intrigue break the harmony or\r\nembarrass the spirit of our people; beware that our Government be\r\nkept pure and incorrupt in all its parts. United alike in the\r\nconception of our duty and in the high resolve to perform it in the\r\nface of all men, let us dedicate ourselves to the great task to which\r\nwe must now set our hand. For myself I beg your tolerance, your\r\ncountenance, and your united aid. The shadows that now lie dark upon\r\nour path will soon be dispelled and we shall walk with the light all\r\nabout us if we be but true to ourselves--to ourselves as we have\r\nwished to be known in the counsels of the world and in the thought of\r\nall those who love liberty and justice and the right exalted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWE MUST ACCEPT WAR\r\n\r\n(_Message to the Congress, April 2, 1917_)\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Congress,--I have called the Congress into\r\nextraordinary session because there are serious, very serious,\r\nchoices of policy to be made, and made immediately, which it was\r\nneither right nor constitutionally permissible that I should assume\r\nthe responsibility of making.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of February last I officially laid before you the\r\nextraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on\r\nand after the first day of February it was its purpose to put aside\r\nall restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink\r\nevery vessel that sought to approach either the ports of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland or the western coasts of Europe or any of the\r\nports controlled by the enemies of Germany within the Mediterranean.\r\nThat had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare\r\nearlier in the war, but since April of last year the Imperial\r\nGovernment had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea\r\ncraft in conformity with its promise then given to us that\r\npassenger-boats should not be sunk, and that due warning would be\r\ngiven to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy\r\nwhen no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken\r\nthat their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their\r\nlives in their open boats.\r\n\r\nThe precautions taken were meager and haphazard enough, as was proved\r\nin distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel\r\nand unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY'S RUTHLESS POLICY\r\n\r\nThe new policy has swept every restriction aside. Vessels of every\r\nkind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their\r\ndestination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom\r\nwithout warning, and without thought of help or mercy for those on\r\nboard, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of\r\nbelligerents. Even hospital-ships and ships carrying relief to the\r\nsorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter\r\nwere provided with safe conduct through the proscribed areas by the\r\nGerman Government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks\r\nof identity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion\r\nor of principle.\r\n\r\nI was for a little while unable to believe that such things would, in\r\nfact, be done by any Government that had hitherto subscribed to the\r\nhumane practices of civilized nations. International law had its\r\norigin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and\r\nobserved upon the seas, where no nation had right of dominion, and\r\nwhere lay the free highways of the world. By painful stage after\r\nstage has that law been built up with meager enough results, indeed,\r\nafter all was accomplished that could be accomplished, but always\r\nwith a clear view at least of what the heart and conscience of\r\nmankind demanded.\r\n\r\nThis minimum of right the German Government has swept aside under the\r\nplea of retaliation and necessity, and because it had no weapons\r\nwhich it could use at sea except these, which it is impossible to\r\nemploy as it is employing them without throwing to the winds all\r\nscruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were\r\nsupposed to underlie the intercourse of the world.\r\n\r\nI am not now thinking of the loss of property involved, immense and\r\nserious as that is, but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction\r\nof the lives of non-combatants, men, women and children engaged in\r\npursuits which have always, even in the darkest periods of modern\r\nhistory, been deemed innocent and legitimate.\r\n\r\nProperty can be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people\r\ncannot be.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN WARFARE AGAINST MANKIND\r\n\r\nThe present German warfare against commerce is a warfare against\r\nmankind. It is a war against all nations. American ships have been\r\nsunk, American lives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very\r\ndeeply to learn of, but the ships and people of other neutral and\r\nfriendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the\r\nsame way. There has been no discrimination. The challenge is to all\r\nmankind. Each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it. The\r\nchoice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of\r\ncounsel and a temperateness of judgment befitting our character and\r\nour motives as a nation. We must put excited feeling away.\r\n\r\nOur motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the\r\nphysical might of the nation, but only the vindication of right, of\r\nhuman right, of which we are only a single champion.\r\n\r\nWhen I addressed the Congress on the 26th of February last I thought\r\nthat it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms, our\r\nright to use the seas against unlawful interference, our right to\r\nkeep our people safe against unlawful violence. But armed neutrality,\r\nit now appears, is impracticable. Because submarines are in effect\r\noutlaws when used as the German submarines have been used against\r\nmerchant shipping, it is impossible to defend ships against their\r\nattacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would\r\ndefend themselves against privateers or cruisers, visible craft\r\ngiving chase upon the open sea.\r\n\r\nIt is common prudence in such circumstances, grim necessity, indeed,\r\nto endeavor to destroy them before they have shown their own\r\nintention. They must be dealt with upon sight, if dealt with at all.\r\n\r\nThe German Government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all\r\nwithin the areas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the\r\ndefense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before\r\nquestioned their right to defend. The intimation is conveyed that the\r\narmed guards which we have placed on our merchant-ships will be\r\ntreated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as\r\npirates would be.\r\n\r\nArmed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances\r\nand in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual; it\r\nis likely to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically\r\ncertain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the\r\neffectiveness of belligerents.\r\n\r\nThere is one choice we cannot make, we are incapable of making: we\r\nwill not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred\r\nrights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated. The\r\nwrongs against which we now array ourselves are not common wrongs;\r\nthey reach out to the very roots of human life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLIGERENCY THRUST UPON US\r\n\r\nWith a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of\r\nthe step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it\r\ninvolves, but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my\r\nconstitutional duty, I advise that the Congress declare the recent\r\ncourse of the Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less\r\nthan war against the Government and people of the United States. That\r\nit formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been\r\nthrust upon it and that it take immediate steps not only to put the\r\ncountry in a more thorough state of defense, but also to exert all\r\nits power and employ all its resources to bring the Government of the\r\nGerman Empire to terms and end the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THIS WILL INVOLVE\r\n\r\nWhat this will involve is clear. It will involve the utmost\r\npracticable co-operation in counsel and action with the Governments\r\nnow at war with Germany, and as incident to that the extension to\r\nthose Governments of the most liberal financial credits in order that\r\nour resources may so far as possible be added to theirs.\r\n\r\nIt will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material\r\nresources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the\r\nincidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most\r\neconomical and efficient way possible.\r\n\r\nIt will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all\r\nrespects, but particularly in supplying it with the best means of\r\ndealing with the enemy's submarines.\r\n\r\nIt will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the\r\nUnited States already provided for by law in case of war at least\r\n500,000 men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the principle\r\nof universal liability to service, and also the authorization of\r\nsubsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may\r\nbe needed and can be handled in training.\r\n\r\nIt will involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits to\r\nthe Government, sustained, I hope, so far as they can equitably be\r\nsustained by the present generation, by well-conceived taxation. I\r\nsay sustained so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seems\r\nto me that it would be most unwise to base the credits which will now\r\nbe necessary entirely on money borrowed.\r\n\r\nIt is our duty, I most respectfully urge, to protect our people so\r\nfar as we may against the very serious hardships and evils which\r\nwould be likely to arise out of the inflation which would be produced\r\nby vast loans.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the measures by which these things are to be\r\naccomplished we should keep constantly in mind the wisdom of\r\ninterfering as little as possible in our own preparation and in the\r\nequipment of our own military forces with the duty--for it will be a\r\nvery practical duty--of supplying the nations already at war with\r\nGermany with the materials which they can obtain only from us or by\r\nour assistance. They are in the field and we should help them in\r\nevery way to be effective there.\r\n\r\nI shall take the liberty of suggesting, through the several executive\r\ndepartments of the Government, for the consideration of your\r\ncommittees measures for the accomplishment of the several objects I\r\nhave mentioned. I hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with\r\nthem as having been framed after very careful thought by the branch\r\nof the Government upon which the responsibility of conducting the war\r\nand safeguarding the nation will most directly fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MOTIVES AND OBJECTS\r\n\r\nWhile we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be\r\nvery clear and make very clear to all the world what our motives and\r\nour objects are. My own thought has not been driven from its habitual\r\nand normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and I\r\ndo not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or\r\nclouded by them.\r\n\r\nI have exactly the same thing in mind now that I had in mind when I\r\naddressed the Senate on the 22d of January last; the same that I had\r\nin mind when I addressed the Congress on the 3d of February and on\r\nthe 26th of February.\r\n\r\nOur object now, as then, is to vindicate the principles of peace and\r\njustice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic\r\npower and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples\r\nof the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will\r\nhenceforth insure the observance of those principles.\r\n\r\nNeutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the\r\nworld is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the menace to\r\nthat peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic\r\nGovernments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by\r\ntheir will, not by the will of their people. We have seen the last of\r\nneutrality in such circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe are at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that\r\nthe same standards of conduct and of responsibility for wrong done\r\nshall be observed among nations and their Governments that are\r\nobserved among the individual citizens of civilized states.\r\n\r\nWe have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling toward\r\nthem but one of sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their\r\nimpulse that their Government acted in entering this war. It was not\r\nwith their previous knowledge or approval.\r\n\r\nIt was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in\r\nthe old, unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their\r\nrulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties\r\nor of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their\r\nfellow-men as pawns and tools.\r\n\r\nSelf-governed nations do not fill their neighbor states with spies or\r\nset the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of\r\naffairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make\r\nconquest. Such designs can be successfully worked only under cover\r\nand where no one has the right to ask questions.\r\n\r\nCunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression, carried, it may\r\nbe, from generation to generation, can be worked out and kept from\r\nthe light only within the privacy of courts or behind the carefully\r\nguarded confidences of a narrow and privileged class. They are\r\nhappily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon\r\nfull information concerning all the nation's affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE THROUGH FREE PEOPLES\r\n\r\nA steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a\r\npartnership of democratic nations. No autocratic Government could be\r\ntrusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants. It must be\r\na league of honor, a partnership of opinion. Intrigue would eat its\r\nvitals away, the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they\r\nwould and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at\r\nits very heart. Only free peoples can hold their purpose and their\r\nhonor steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to\r\nany narrow interest of their own.\r\n\r\nDoes not every American feel that assurance has been added to our\r\nhope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and\r\nheartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks\r\nin Russia?\r\n\r\nRussia was known by those who know it best to have been always in\r\nfact democratic at heart, in all the vital habits of her thought, in\r\nall the intimate relationships of her people that spoke their natural\r\ninstinct, their habitual attitude toward life.\r\n\r\nAutocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure, long as\r\nit had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power, was not in\r\nfact Russian in origin, in character or purpose; and now it has been\r\nshaken and the great, generous Russian people have been added, in all\r\ntheir native majesty and might, to the forces that are fighting for\r\nfreedom in the world, for justice and for peace. Here is a fit\r\npartner for a league of honor.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that have served to convince us that the Prussian\r\nautocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very\r\noutset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities\r\nand even our offices of Government with spies and set criminal\r\nintrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of council, our\r\npeace within and without, our industries and our commerce.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is now evident that its spies were here even before the\r\nwar began, and it is, unhappily, not a matter of conjecture, but a\r\nfact proved in our courts of justice, that the intrigues which have\r\nmore than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and\r\ndislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the\r\ninstigation, with the support, and even under the personal direction,\r\nof official agents of the Imperial German Government accredited to\r\nthe Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nEven in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have\r\nsought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon them\r\nbecause we knew that their source lay, not in any hostile feeling or\r\npurpose of the German people toward us (who were, no doubt, as\r\nignorant of them as we ourselves were), but only in the selfish\r\ndesigns of a Government that did what it pleased and told its people\r\nnothing. But they have played their part in serving to convince us at\r\nlast that that Government entertains no real friendship for us and\r\nmeans to act against our peace and security at its convenience. That\r\nit means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors the\r\nintercepted note to the German Minister at Mexico City is eloquent\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHALLENGE OF HOSTILE PURPOSE\r\n\r\nWe are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know\r\nthat in such a Government, following such methods, we can never have\r\na friend; and that in the presence of its organized power, always\r\nlying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no\r\nassured security for the democratic Governments of the world.\r\n\r\nWe are now about to accept the gage of battle with this natural foe\r\nto liberty, and shall, if necessary, spend the whole force of the\r\nnation to check and nullify its pretensions and its power. We are\r\nglad, now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about\r\nthem, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the\r\nliberation of its peoples, the German people included; for the rights\r\nof nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to\r\nchoose their way of life and of obedience. The world must be made\r\nsafe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the trusted\r\nfoundations of political liberty.\r\n\r\nWe have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion.\r\nWe seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for\r\nthe sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions\r\nof the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights\r\nhave been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of the nation\r\ncan make them.\r\n\r\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish objects,\r\nseeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with\r\nall free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations\r\nas belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud\r\npunctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be\r\nfighting for.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of the Governments allied with the Imperial\r\nGovernment of Germany because they have not made war upon us or\r\nchallenged us to defend our right and our honor.\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian Government has indeed avowed its unqualified\r\nindorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine\r\nwarfare adopted now without disguise by the Imperial German\r\nGovernment, and it has therefore not been possible for this\r\nGovernment to receive Count Tarnowski, the ambassador recently\r\naccredited to this Government by the Imperial and Royal Government of\r\nAustria-Hungary; but that Government has not actually engaged in\r\nwarfare against citizens of the United States on the seas, and I take\r\nthe liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a discussion of\r\nour relations with the authorities at Vienna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPOSITION TO THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDSHIP TOWARD THE GERMAN PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because\r\nthere are no other means of defending our rights.\r\n\r\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents\r\nin a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus,\r\nnot in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury\r\nor disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an\r\nirresponsible Government which has thrown aside all considerations of\r\nhumanity and of right and is running amuck.\r\n\r\nWe are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people,\r\nand shall desire nothing so much as the early re-establishment of\r\nintimate relations of mutual advantage between us--however hard it\r\nmay be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken\r\nfrom our hearts. We have borne with their present Government through\r\nall these bitter months because of that friendship--exercising a\r\npatience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible.\r\n\r\nWe shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship\r\nin our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and\r\nwomen of German birth and native sympathy who live amongst us and\r\nshare our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are,\r\nin fact, loyal to their neighbors and to the Government in the hour\r\nof test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if\r\nthey had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be\r\nprompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may\r\nbe of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty it\r\nwill be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it\r\nlifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and\r\nwithout countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT MORE PRECIOUS THAN PEACE\r\n\r\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress,\r\nwhich I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be,\r\nmany months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful\r\nthing to lead this great, peaceful people into war, into the most\r\nterrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to\r\nbe in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we\r\nshall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our\r\nhearts--for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority\r\nto have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and\r\nliberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such\r\na concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all\r\nnations and make the world itself at last free.\r\n\r\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything\r\nthat we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who\r\nknow that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her\r\nblood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and\r\nhappiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she\r\ncan do no other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nA STATE OF WAR\r\n\r\n(_The President's Proclamation of April 6, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas, the Congress of the United States, in the exercise of the\r\nconstitutional authority vested in them, have resolved by joint\r\nresolution of the Senate and House of Representatives, bearing\r\ndate this day, that a state of war between the United States and\r\nthe Imperial German Government, which has been thrust upon the\r\nUnited States, is hereby formally declared;\r\n\r\nWhereas, It is provided by Section 4067 of the Revised Statutes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Whenever there is declared a war between the United States\r\n    and any foreign nation or Government, or any invasion or\r\n    predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted or\r\n    threatened against the territory of the United States by\r\n    any foreign nation or Government, and the President makes\r\n    public proclamation of the event, all natives, citizens,\r\n    denizens or subjects of a hostile nation or Government\r\n    being male of the age of fourteen years and upward who\r\n    shall be within the United States and not actually\r\n    naturalized shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained\r\n    secured and removed as alien enemies.\r\n\r\nThe President is authorized in any such event, by his proclamation\r\nthereof or other public acts, to direct the conduct to be observed on\r\nthe part of the United States toward the aliens who become so liable;\r\nthe manner and degree of the restraint to which they shall be subject\r\nand in what cases and upon what security their residence shall be\r\npermitted and to provide for the removal of those who, not being\r\npermitted to reside within the United States, refuse or neglect to\r\ndepart therefrom, and to establish any such regulations which are\r\nfound necessary in the premises and for the public safety;\r\n\r\nWhereas, By Sections 4068, 4069, and 4070 of the Revised Statutes\r\nfurther provision is made relative to alien enemies;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby proclaim to all whom it may concern that a state\r\nof war exists between the United States and the Imperial German\r\nGovernment, and I do specially direct all officers, civil or\r\nmilitary, of the United States that they exercise vigilance and zeal\r\nin the discharge of the duties incident to such a state of war, and I\r\ndo, moreover, earnestly appeal to all American citizens that they, in\r\nloyal devotion to their country, dedicated from its foundation to the\r\nprinciples of liberty and justice, uphold the laws of the land and\r\ngive undivided and willing support to those measures which may be\r\nadopted by the constitutional authorities in prosecuting the war to a\r\nsuccessful issue and in obtaining a secure and just peace;\r\n\r\nAnd acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the\r\nConstitution of the United States and the said sections of the\r\nRevised Statutes:\r\n\r\nI do hereby further proclaim and direct that the conduct to be\r\nobserved on the part of the United States toward all natives,\r\ncitizens, denizens or subjects of Germany, being male, of the age of\r\nfourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and\r\nnot actually naturalized, who for the purpose of this proclamation\r\nand under such sections of the Revised Statutes are termed alien\r\nenemies, shall be as follows:\r\n\r\n    All alien enemies are enjoined to preserve the peace\r\n    toward the United States and to refrain from crime against\r\n    the public safety and from violating the laws of the\r\n    United States and of the States and Territories thereof,\r\n    and to refrain from actual hostility or giving\r\n    information, aid or comfort to the enemies of the United\r\n    States, and to comply strictly with the regulations which\r\n    are hereby or which may be from time to time promulgated\r\n    by the President, and so long as they shall conduct\r\n    themselves in accordance with law they shall be\r\n    undisturbed in the peaceful pursuit of their lives and\r\n    occupations and be accorded the consideration due to all\r\n    peaceful and law-abiding persons, except so far as\r\n    restrictions may be necessary for their own protection and\r\n    for the safety of the United States, and toward such alien\r\n    enemies as conduct themselves in accordance with law all\r\n    citizens of the United States are enjoined to preserve the\r\n    peace and to treat them with all such friendliness as may\r\n    be compatible with loyalty and allegiance to the United\r\n    States.\r\n\r\n    And all alien enemies who fail to conduct themselves as so\r\n    enjoined, in addition to all other penalties prescribed by\r\n    law, shall be liable to restraint or to give security or\r\n    to remove and depart from the United States in the manner\r\n    prescribed by Sections 4069 and 4070 of the Revised\r\n    Statutes and as prescribed in the regulations duly\r\n    promulgated by the President.\r\n\r\nAnd, pursuant to the authority vested in me, I hereby declare and\r\nestablish the following regulations, which I find necessary in the\r\npremises and for the public safety:\r\n\r\n    First. An alien enemy shall not have in his possession at\r\n    any time or place any firearms, weapons or implement of\r\n    war, or component parts thereof; ammunition, Maxim or\r\n    other silencer, arms or explosives or material used in the\r\n    manufacture of explosives.\r\n\r\n    Second. An alien enemy shall not have in his possession at\r\n    any time or place, or use or operate, any aircraft or\r\n    wireless apparatus, or any form of signaling device, or\r\n    any form of cipher code or any paper, document or book\r\n    written or printed in cipher, or in which there may be\r\n    invisible writing.\r\n\r\n    Third. All property found in the possession of an alien\r\n    enemy in violation of the foregoing regulations shall be\r\n    subject to seizure by the United States.\r\n\r\n    Fourth. An alien enemy shall not approach or be found\r\n    within one-half of a mile of any Federal or State fort,\r\n    camp, arsenal, aircraft station, Government or naval\r\n    vessel, navy-yard, factory or workshop for the\r\n    manufacture of munitions of war or of any products for the\r\n    use of the army or navy.\r\n\r\n    Fifth. An alien enemy shall not write, print or publish\r\n    any attack or threat against the Government or Congress of\r\n    the United States, or either branch thereof, or against\r\n    the measures or policy of the United States, or against\r\n    the persons or property of any person in the military,\r\n    naval or civil service of the United States, or of the\r\n    States or Territories, or of the District of Columbia, or\r\n    of the municipal governments therein.\r\n\r\n    Sixth. An alien enemy shall not commit or abet any hostile\r\n    acts against the United States, or give information, aid\r\n    or comfort to its enemies.\r\n\r\n    Seventh. An alien enemy shall not reside in or continue to\r\n    reside in, to remain in or enter any locality which the\r\n    President may from time to time designate by an executive\r\n    order as a prohibitive area in which residence by an alien\r\n    enemy shall be found by him to constitute a danger to the\r\n    public peace and safety of the United States except by\r\n    permit from the President and except under such\r\n    limitations or restrictions as the President may\r\n    prescribe.\r\n\r\n    Eighth. An alien enemy whom the President shall have\r\n    reasonable cause to believe to be aiding or about to aid\r\n    the enemy, or to be at large to the danger of the public\r\n    peace or safety of the United States, or to have violated\r\n    or to be about to violate any of these regulations, shall\r\n    remove to any location designated by the President by\r\n    executive order, and shall not remove therefrom without\r\n    permit, or shall depart from the United States if so\r\n    required by the President.\r\n\r\n    Ninth. No alien enemy shall depart from the United States\r\n    until he shall have received such permit as the President\r\n    shall prescribe, or except under order of a Court, Judge\r\n    or Justice, under Sections 4069 and 4070 of the Revised\r\n    Statutes.\r\n\r\n    Tenth. No alien enemy shall land in or enter the\r\n    United States except under such restrictions and at such\r\n    places as the President may prescribe.\r\n\r\n    Eleventh. If necessary to prevent violation of the\r\n    regulations, all alien enemies will be obliged to\r\n    register.\r\n\r\n    Twelfth. An alien enemy whom there may be reasonable cause\r\n    to believe to be aiding or about to aid the enemy, or to\r\n    be at large to the danger of the public peace or safety,\r\n    or who violates or who attempts to violate or of whom\r\n    there is reasonable grounds to believe that he is about to\r\n    violate any regulation to be promulgated by the President\r\n    or any criminal law of the United States or of the States\r\n    or Territories thereof, will be subject to summary arrest\r\n    by the United States, by the United States Marshal or his\r\n    deputy or such other officers as the President shall\r\n    designate, and to confinement in such penitentiary,\r\n    prison, jail, military camp, or other place of detention\r\n    as may be directed by the President.\r\n\r\nThis proclamation and the regulations herein contained shall extend\r\nand apply to all land and water, continental or insular, in any way\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\"SPEAK, ACT AND SERVE TOGETHER\"\r\n\r\n(_Message to the American People, April 15, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FELLOW COUNTRYMEN,--The entrance of our own beloved\r\ncountry into the grim and terrible war for democracy and human rights\r\nwhich has shaken the world creates so many problems of national life\r\nand action which call for immediate consideration and settlement that\r\nI hope you will permit me to address to you a few words of earnest\r\ncounsel and appeal with regard to them.\r\n\r\nWe are rapidly putting our navy upon an effective war footing and are\r\nabout to create and equip a great army, but these are the simplest\r\nparts of the great task to which we have addressed ourselves. There\r\nis not a single selfish element, so far as I can see, in the cause we\r\nare fighting for. We are fighting for what we believe and wish to be\r\nthe rights of mankind and for the future peace and security of the\r\nworld. To do this great thing worthily and successfully we must\r\ndevote ourselves to the service without regard to profit or material\r\nadvantage and with an energy and intelligence that will rise to the\r\nlevel of the enterprise itself. We must realize to the full how great\r\nthe task is and how many things, how many kinds and elements of\r\ncapacity and service and self-sacrifice it involves.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WE MUST DO\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the things we must do, and do well, besides\r\nfighting--the things without which mere fighting would be fruitless:\r\n\r\nWe must supply abundant food for ourselves and for our armies and our\r\nseamen, not only, but also for a large part of the nations with whom\r\nwe have now made common cause, in whose support and by whose sides we\r\nshall be fighting.\r\n\r\nWe must supply ships by the hundreds out of our shipyards to carry to\r\nthe other side of the sea, submarines or no submarines, what will\r\nevery day be needed there, and abundant materials out of our fields\r\nand our mines and our factories with which not only to clothe and\r\nequip our own forces on land and sea, but also to clothe and support\r\nour people, for whom the gallant fellows under arms can no longer\r\nwork; to help clothe and equip the armies with which we are\r\nco-operating in Europe, and to keep the looms and manufactories there\r\nin raw material; coal to keep the fires going in ships at sea and in\r\nthe furnaces of hundreds of factories across the sea; steel out of\r\nwhich to make arms and ammunition both here and there; rails for\r\nwornout railways back of the fighting fronts; locomotives and\r\nrolling-stock to take the place of those every day going to pieces;\r\nmules, horses, cattle for labor and for military service; everything\r\nwith which the people of England and France and Italy and Russia have\r\nusually supplied themselves, but cannot now afford the men, the\r\nmaterials or the machinery to make.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREATER EFFICIENCY\r\n\r\nIt is evident to every thinking man that our industries, on the\r\nfarms, in the shipyards, in the mines, in the factories, must be made\r\nmore prolific and more efficient than ever, and that they must be\r\nmore economically managed and better adapted to the particular\r\nrequirements of our task than they have been; and what I want to say\r\nis that the men and the women who devote their thought and their\r\nenergy to these things will be serving the country and conducting the\r\nfight for peace and freedom just as truly and just as effectively as\r\nthe men on the battle-field or in the trenches. The industrial forces\r\nof the country, men and women alike, will be a great national, a\r\ngreat international, service army--a notable and honored host engaged\r\nin the service of the nation and the world, the efficient friends and\r\nsaviors of free men everywhere. Thousands, nay, hundreds of\r\nthousands, of men otherwise liable to military service will of right\r\nand of necessity be excused from that service and assigned to the\r\nfundamental sustaining work of the fields and factories and mines,\r\nand they will be as much part of the great patriotic forces of the\r\nnation as the men under fire.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty, therefore, of addressing this word to the farmers\r\nof the country and to all who work on the farms: The supreme need of\r\nour own nation and of the nations with which we are co-operating is\r\nan abundance of supplies, and especially of foodstuffs. The\r\nimportance of an adequate food-supply, especially for the present\r\nyear, is superlative. Without abundant food, alike for the armies and\r\nthe peoples now at war, the whole great enterprise upon which we have\r\nembarked will break down and fail. The world's food reserves are low.\r\nNot only during the present emergency, but for some time after peace\r\nshall have come, both our own people and a large proportion of the\r\npeople of Europe must rely upon the harvests in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FARMERS\r\n\r\nUpon the farmers of this country, therefore, in large measure rest\r\nthe fate of the war and the fate of the nations. May the nation not\r\ncount upon them to omit no step that will increase the production of\r\ntheir land or that will bring about the most effectual co-operation\r\nin the sale and distribution of their products? The time is short. It\r\nis of the most imperative importance that everything possible be\r\ndone, and done immediately, to make sure of large harvests. I call\r\nupon young men and old alike and upon the able-bodied boys of the\r\nland to accept and act upon this duty--to turn in hosts to the farms\r\nand make certain that no pains and no labor is lacking in this great\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nI particularly appeal to the farmers of the South to plant abundant\r\nfoodstuffs, as well as cotton. They can show their patriotism in no\r\nbetter or more convincing way than by resisting the great temptation\r\nof the present price of cotton and helping, helping upon a great\r\nscale, to feed the nation and the peoples everywhere who are fighting\r\nfor their liberties and for our own. The variety of their crops will\r\nbe the visible measure of their comprehension of their national duty.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States and the Governments of the\r\nseveral States stand ready to co-operate. They will do everything\r\npossible to assist farmers in securing an adequate supply of seed, an\r\nadequate force of laborers when they are most needed, at\r\nharvest-time, and the means of expediting shipments of fertilizers\r\nand farm machinery, as well as of the crops themselves when\r\nharvested. The course of trade shall be as unhampered as it is\r\npossible to make it, and there shall be no unwarranted manipulation\r\nof the nation's food-supply by those who handle it on its way to the\r\nconsumer. This is our opportunity to demonstrate the efficiency of a\r\ngreat democracy, and we shall not fall short of it!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUTY OF MIDDLEMEN\r\n\r\nThis let me say to the middlemen of every sort, whether they are\r\nhandling our foodstuffs or the raw materials of manufacture or the\r\nproducts of our mills and factories: The eyes of the country will be\r\nespecially upon you. This is your opportunity for signal service,\r\nefficient and disinterested. The country expects you, as it expects\r\nall others, to forego unusual profits, to organize and expedite\r\nshipments of supplies of every kind, but especially of food, with an\r\neye to the service you are rendering and in the spirit of those who\r\nenlist in the ranks, for their people, not for themselves. I shall\r\nconfidently expect you to deserve and win the confidence of people of\r\nevery sort and station.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEN OF THE RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nTo the men who run the railways of the country, whether they be\r\nmanagers or operative employees, let me say that the railways are the\r\narteries of the nation's life and that upon them rests the immense\r\nresponsibility of seeing to it that those arteries suffer no\r\nobstruction of any kind, no inefficiency or slackened power. To the\r\nmerchant let me suggest the motto, \"Small profits and quick service,\"\r\nand to the shipbuilder the thought that the life of the war depends\r\nupon him. The food and the war supplies must be carried across the\r\nseas, no matter how many ships are sent to the bottom. The places of\r\nthose that go down must be supplied, and supplied at once. To the\r\nminer let me say that he stands where the farmer does: the work of\r\nthe world waits on him. If he slackens or fails, armies and statesmen\r\nare helpless. He also is enlisted in the great Service Army. The\r\nmanufacturer does not need to be told, I hope, that the nation looks\r\nto him to speed and perfect every process; and I want only to remind\r\nhis employees that their service is absolutely indispensable and is\r\ncounted on by every man who loves the country and its liberties.\r\n\r\nLet me suggest also that every one who creates or cultivates a garden\r\nhelps, and helps greatly, to solve the problem of the feeding of the\r\nnations; and that every housewife who practises strict economy puts\r\nherself in the ranks of those who serve the nation. This is the time\r\nfor America to correct her unpardonable fault of wastefulness and\r\nextravagance. Let every man and every woman assume the duty of\r\ncareful, provident use and expenditure as a public duty, as a dictate\r\nof patriotism which no one can now expect ever to be excused or\r\nforgiven for ignoring.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUPREME TEST\r\n\r\nIn the hope that this statement of the needs of the nation and of the\r\nworld in this hour of supreme crisis may stimulate those to whom it\r\ncomes and remind all who need reminder of the solemn duties of a time\r\nsuch as the world has never seen before, I beg that all editors and\r\npublishers everywhere will give as prominent publication and as wide\r\ncirculation as possible to this appeal. I venture to suggest also to\r\nall advertising agencies that they would perhaps render a very\r\nsubstantial and timely service to the country if they would give it\r\nwidespread repetition. And I hope that clergymen will not think the\r\ntheme of it an unworthy or inappropriate subject of comment and\r\nhomily from their pulpits.\r\n\r\nThe supreme test of the nation has come. We must all speak, act and\r\nserve together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE CONSCRIPTION PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n(_May 18, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas, Congress has enacted and the President has on the 18th day\r\nof May, 1917, approved a law which contains the following provisions:\r\n\r\nSection 5. That all male persons between the ages of twenty-one and\r\nthirty, both inclusive, shall be subject to registration in\r\naccordance with regulations to be prescribed by the President, and\r\nupon proclamation by the President or other public notice given by\r\nhim or by his direction, stating the time and place of such\r\nregistration, it shall be the duty of all persons of the designated\r\nages, except officers and enlisted men of the Regular Army, the Navy\r\nand the National Guard and Naval Militia while in the service of the\r\nUnited States, to present themselves for and submit to registration\r\nunder the provisions of this act.\r\n\r\nAnd every such person shall be deemed to have notice of the\r\nrequirements of this act upon the publication of said proclamation or\r\nother notice as aforesaid given by the President or by his direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PENALTY FOR FAILURE\r\n\r\nAnd any person who shall wilfully fail or refuse to present himself\r\nfor registration or to submit thereto as herein provided, shall be\r\nguilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction in the District\r\nCourt of the United States having jurisdiction thereof, be punished\r\nby imprisonment for not more than one year, and shall thereupon be\r\nduly registered.\r\n\r\nProvided, that in the call of the docket preference shall be given,\r\nin courts trying the same, to the trial of criminal proceedings under\r\nthis act.\r\n\r\nProvided, further, that persons shall be subject to registration as\r\nherein provided who shall have attained their twenty-first birthday\r\nand who shall not have attained their thirty-first birthday on or\r\nbefore the day set for the registration, and all persons so\r\nregistered shall be and remain subject to draft into the forces\r\nhereby authorized unless exempted or excused therefrom, as in this\r\nact provided.\r\n\r\nProvided, further, that in the case of temporary absence from actual\r\nplace of legal residence of any person liable to registration as\r\nprovided herein, such registration may be made by mail under\r\nregulations to be prescribed by the President.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF REGISTRATION\r\n\r\nSection 6. That the President is hereby authorized to utilize the\r\nservice of any or all departments and any or all officers or agents\r\nof the United States and of the several States, Territories and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia and subdivisions thereof, in the execution of\r\nthis act, and all officers and agents of the United States and of the\r\nseveral States, Territories and subdivisions thereof, and of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and all persons designated or appointed under\r\nregulations prescribed by the President, whether such appointments\r\nare made by the President himself or by the Governor or other officer\r\nof any State or Territory to perform any duty in the execution of\r\nthis act, are hereby required to perform such duty as the President\r\nshall order or direct, and all such officers and agents and persons\r\nso designated or appointed shall hereby have full authority for all\r\nacts done by them in the execution of this act, by the direction of\r\nthe President. Correspondence in the execution of this act may be\r\ncarried in penalty envelopes bearing the frank of the War Department.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGLECT OF DUTY AND FRAUD\r\n\r\nAny person charged, as herein provided, with the duty of carrying\r\ninto effect any of the provisions of this act or the regulations made\r\nor directions given thereunder who shall fail or neglect to perform\r\nsuch duty, and any person charged with such duty or having and\r\nexercising any authority under said act, regulations or directions,\r\nwho shall knowingly make or be a party to the making of any false or\r\nincorrect registration, physical examination, exemption, enlistment,\r\nenrolment or muster.\r\n\r\nAnd any person who shall make or be a party to the making of any\r\nfalse statement or certificate as to the fitness or liability of\r\nhimself or any other person for service under the provisions of this\r\nact, or regulations made by the President thereunder, or otherwise\r\nevades or aids another to evade the requirements of this act or of\r\nsaid regulations, or who, in any manner, shall fail or neglect fully\r\nto perform any duty required of him in the execution of this act,\r\nshall, if not subject to military law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and\r\nupon conviction in the District Court of the United States having\r\njurisdiction thereof be punished by imprisonment for not more than\r\none year, or, if subject to military law, shall be tried by court\r\nmartial and suffer such punishment as a court martial may direct.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CALL TO GOVERNORS\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, do\r\ncall upon the Governor of each of the several States and Territories,\r\nthe Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia and all\r\nofficers and agents of the several States and Territories, of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and of the counties and municipalities therein,\r\nto perform certain duties in the execution of the foregoing law,\r\nwhich duties will be communicated to them directly in regulations of\r\neven date herewith.\r\n\r\nAnd I do further proclaim and give notice to all persons subject to\r\nregistration in the several States and in the District of Columbia,\r\nin accordance with the above law, that the time and place of such\r\nregistration shall be between 7 A.M. and 7 P.M. on the 5th day of\r\nJune, 1917, at the registration place in the precinct wherein\r\nthey have their permanent homes.\r\n\r\nThose who shall have attained their twenty-first birthday and who\r\nshall not have attained their thirty-first birthday on or before the\r\nday here named are required to register, excepting only officers and\r\nenlisted men of the Regular Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps and the\r\nNational Guard and Naval Militia while in the service of the United\r\nStates, and officers in the Officers' Reserve Corps and enlisted men\r\nin the enlisted Reserve Corps while in active service. In the\r\nTerritories of Alaska, Hawaii and Porto Rico a day for registration\r\nwill be named in a later proclamation.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION BY MAIL\r\n\r\nAnd I do hereby charge those who, through sickness, shall be unable\r\nto present themselves for registration that they apply on or before\r\nthe day of registration to the County Clerk of the county where they\r\nmay be for instructions as to how they may be registered by agent.\r\n\r\nThose who expect to be absent on the day named from the counties in\r\nwhich they have their permanent homes may register by mail, but their\r\nmailed registration cards must reach the places in which they have\r\ntheir permanent homes by the day named herein. They should apply as\r\nsoon as practicable to the County Clerk of the county wherein they\r\nmay be for instructions as to how they may accomplish their\r\nregistration by mail.\r\n\r\nIn case such persons as, through sickness or absence, may be unable\r\nto present themselves personally for registration shall be sojourning\r\nin cities of over 30,000 population, they shall apply to the City\r\nClerk of the city wherein they may be sojourning rather than to the\r\nClerk of the county.\r\n\r\nThe Clerks of counties and of cities of over 30,000 population, in\r\nwhich numerous applications from the sick and from non-residents are\r\nexpected, are authorized to establish such sub-agencies and to employ\r\nand deputize such clerical force as may be necessary to accommodate\r\nthese applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHOLE NATION AN ARMY\r\n\r\nThe Power against which we are arrayed has sought to impose its will\r\nupon the world by force. To this end it has increased armament until\r\nit has changed the face of war. In the sense in which we have been\r\nwont to think of armies there are no armies in this struggle, there\r\nare entire nations armed.\r\n\r\nThus, the men who remain to till the soil and man the factories are\r\nno less a part of the army that is in France than the men beneath the\r\nbattle flags.\r\n\r\nIt must be so with us. It is not an army that we must shape and train\r\nfor war--it is a Nation. To this end our people must draw close in\r\none compact front against a common foe. But this cannot be if each\r\nman pursues a private purpose. All must pursue one purpose. The\r\nNation needs all men, but it needs each man, not in the field that\r\nwill most pleasure him, but in the endeavor that will best serve the\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\nThus, though a sharpshooter pleases to operate a trip-hammer for the\r\nforging of great guns, and an expert machinist desires to march with\r\nthe flag, the Nation is being served only when the sharpshooter\r\nmarches and the machinist remains at his levers. The whole Nation\r\nmust be a team, in which each man shall play the part for which he is\r\nbest fitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT A DRAFT OF THE UNWILLING\r\n\r\nTo this end Congress has provided that the Nation shall be organized\r\nfor war by selection, that each man shall be classified for service\r\nin the place to which it shall best serve the general good to call\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this cannot be overstated. It is a new thing in\r\nour history and a landmark in our progress. It is a new manner of\r\naccepting and vitalizing our duty to give ourselves with thoughtful\r\ndevotion to the common purpose of us all. It is in no sense a\r\nconscription of the unwilling. It is, rather, selection from a Nation\r\nwhich has volunteered in mass.\r\n\r\nIt is no more a choosing of those who shall march with the colors\r\nthan it is a selection of those who shall serve an equally necessary\r\nand devoted purpose in the industries that lie behind the\r\nbattle-lines.\r\n\r\nThe day here named is the time upon which all shall present\r\nthemselves for assignment to their tasks. It is for that reason\r\ndestined to be remembered as one of the most conspicuous moments in\r\nour history. It is nothing less than the day upon which the manhood\r\nof the country shall step forward in one solid rank in defense of the\r\nideals to which this Nation is consecrated. It is important to those\r\nideals, no less than to the pride of this generation in manifesting\r\nits devotion to them, that there be no gaps in the ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAY OF PATRIOTIC DEVOTION\r\n\r\nIt is essential that the day be approached in thoughtful apprehension\r\nof its significance and that we accord to it the honor and the\r\nmeaning that it deserves. Our industrial need prescribes that it be\r\nnot made a technical holiday, but the stern sacrifice that is before\r\nus urges that it be carried in all our hearts as a great day of\r\npatriotic devotion and obligation, when the duty shall lie upon every\r\nman, whether he is himself to be registered or not, to see to it that\r\nthe name of every male person of the designated ages is written on\r\nthese lists of honor.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal\r\nof the United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington this 18th day of May, in the year of\r\nour Lord, 1917, and of the independence of the United States of\r\nAmerica the one hundred and forty-first.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT LANSING, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nCONSERVING THE NATION'S FOOD\r\n\r\n(_May 19, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very desirable, in order to prevent misunderstanding or alarms\r\nand to assure co-operation in a vital matter, that the country should\r\nunderstand exactly the scope and purpose of the very great powers\r\nwhich I have thought it necessary, in the circumstances, to ask the\r\nCongress to put in my hands with regard to our food-supplies.\r\n\r\nThose powers are very great, indeed, but they are no greater than it\r\nhas proved necessary to lodge in the other Governments which are\r\nconducting this momentous war, and their object is stimulation and\r\nconservation, not arbitrary restraint or injurious interference with\r\nthe normal processes of production. They are intended to benefit and\r\nassist the farmer and all those who play a legitimate part in the\r\npreparation, distribution and marketing of foodstuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHARP LINE OF DISTINCTION\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to draw a sharp line of distinction between the normal\r\nactivities of the Government, represented in the Department of\r\nAgriculture, in reference to food production, conservation and\r\nmarketing, on the one hand, and the emergency activities necessitated\r\nby the war, in reference to the regulation of food distribution and\r\nconsumption, on the other.\r\n\r\nAll measures intended directly to extend the normal activities of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, in reference to the production,\r\nconservation and the marketing of farm crops, will be administered,\r\nas in normal times, through that department; and the powers asked for\r\nover distribution and consumption, over exports, imports, prices,\r\npurchase and requisition of commodities, storing and the like, which\r\nmay require regulation during the war, will be placed in the hands of\r\na Commissioner of Food Administration, appointed by the President and\r\ndirectly responsible to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END TO BE ATTAINED\r\n\r\nThe objects sought to be served by the legislation asked for are:\r\nFull inquiry into the existing available stocks of foodstuffs and\r\ninto the costs and practices of the various food producing and\r\ndistributing trades; the prevention of all unwarranted hoarding of\r\nevery kind, and of the control of foodstuffs by persons who are not\r\nin any legitimate sense producers, dealers or traders; the\r\nrequisition, when necessary for public use, of food supplies and of\r\nthe equipment necessary for handling them properly; the licensing of\r\nwholesome and legitimate mixtures and milling percentages, and the\r\nprohibition of the unnecessary or wasteful use of foods.\r\n\r\nAuthority is asked also to establish prices, but not in order to\r\nlimit the profits of the farmers, but only to guarantee to them, when\r\nnecessary, a minimum price, which will insure them a profit where\r\nthey are asked to attempt new crops, and to secure the consumer\r\nagainst extortion by breaking up corners and attempts at speculation\r\nwhen they occur, by fixing temporarily a reasonable price at which\r\nmiddlemen must sell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIXING OF PRICES\r\n\r\nI have asked Mr. Herbert Hoover to undertake this all-important task\r\nof food administration. He has expressed his willingness to do so, on\r\ncondition that he is to receive no payment for his services, and that\r\nthe whole of the force under him, exclusive of clerical assistance,\r\nshall be employed, as far as possible, upon the same volunteer basis.\r\n\r\nHe has expressed his confidence that this difficult matter of food\r\nadministration can be successfully accomplished through the voluntary\r\nco-operation and direction of legitimate distributers of foodstuffs\r\nand with the help of the women of the country.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is absolutely necessary that unquestionable powers shall\r\nbe placed in my hands, in order to insure the success of this\r\nadministration of the food-supplies of the country, I am confident\r\nthat the exercise of those powers will be necessary only in the few\r\ncases where some small and selfish minority proves unwilling to put\r\nthe Nation's interests above personal advantage, and that the whole\r\ncountry will heartily support Mr. Hoover's efforts by supplying the\r\nnecessary volunteer agencies throughout the country for the\r\nintelligent control of food consumption, and securing the\r\nco-operation of the most capable leaders of the very interests most\r\ndirectly affected, that the exercise of the powers deputed to him\r\nwill rest very successfully upon the good-will and co-operation of\r\nthe people themselves, and that the ordinary economic machinery of\r\nthe country will be left substantially undisturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO FEAR OF BUREAUCRACY\r\n\r\nThe proposed food administration is intended, of course, only to meet\r\na manifest emergency and to continue only while the war lasts. Since\r\nit will be composed for the most part of volunteers, there need be no\r\nfear of the possibility of a permanent bureaucracy arising out of it.\r\n\r\nAll control of consumption will disappear when the emergency has\r\npassed. It is with that object in view that the Administration\r\nconsiders it to be of pre-eminent importance that the existing\r\nassociations of producers and distributers of foodstuffs should be\r\nmobilized and made use of on a volunteer basis. The successful\r\nconduct of the projected food administration, by such means, will be\r\nthe finest possible demonstration of the willingness, the ability and\r\nthe efficiency of democracy and of its justified reliance upon the\r\nfreedom of individual initiative.\r\n\r\nThe last thing that any American could contemplate with equanimity\r\nwould be the introduction of anything resembling Prussian autocracy\r\ninto the food control of this country.\r\n\r\nIt is of vital interest and importance to every man who produces food\r\nand to every man who takes part in its distribution that these\r\npolicies, thus liberally administered, should succeed and succeed\r\naltogether. It is only in that way that we can prove it to be\r\nabsolutely unnecessary to resort to the rigorous and drastic measures\r\nwhich have proved to be necessary in some of the European countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAN ANSWER TO CRITICS\r\n\r\n(_May 22, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following letter, addressed to Representative Heflin,\r\nDemocrat, of Alabama, President Wilson replies to criticisms\r\nregarding his position with regard to the war and its objects:\r\n\r\nIt is incomprehensible to me how any frank or honest person could\r\ndoubt or question my position with regard to the war and its objects.\r\nI have again and again stated the very serious and long-continued\r\nwrongs which the Imperial German Government has perpetrated against\r\nthe rights, the commerce and the citizens of the United States. The\r\nlist is long and overwhelming. No Nation that respected itself or the\r\nrights of humanity could have borne those wrongs any longer.\r\n\r\nOur objects in going into the war have been stated with equal\r\nclearness. The whole of the conception which I take to be the\r\nconception of our fellow-countrymen with regard to the outcome of the\r\nwar and the terms of its settlement, I set forth with the utmost\r\nexplicitness in an address to the Senate of the United States on the\r\n22d of January last. Again, in my message to Congress on the 2d of\r\nApril last, those objects were stated in unmistakable terms.\r\n\r\nI can conceive no purpose in seeking to becloud this matter except\r\nthe purpose of weakening the hands of the Government and making the\r\npart which the United States is to play in this great struggle for\r\nhuman liberty an inefficient and hesitating part.\r\n\r\nWe have entered the war for our own reasons and with our own objects\r\nclearly stated, and shall forget neither the reasons nor the objects.\r\nThere is no hate in our hearts for the German people, but there is a\r\nresolve which cannot be shaken even by misrepresentation, to overcome\r\nthe pretensions of the autocratic Government which acts upon purposes\r\nto which the German people have never consented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL DAY ADDRESS\r\n\r\n(_May 30, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one sense the great struggle into which we have now entered is an\r\nAmerican struggle, because it is in defense of American honor and\r\nAmerican rights, but it is something even greater than that; it is a\r\nworld struggle. It is the struggle of men who love liberty\r\neverywhere, and in this cause America will show herself greater than\r\never because she will rise to a greater thing.\r\n\r\nThe program has conferred an unmerited dignity upon the remarks I am\r\ngoing to make by calling them an address, because I am not here to\r\ndeliver an address [said the President]. I am here merely to show in\r\nmy official capacity the sympathy of this great Government with the\r\nobject of this occasion, and also to speak just a word of the\r\nsentiment that is in my own heart.\r\n\r\nAny memorial day of this sort is, of course, a day touched with\r\nsorrowful memory, and yet I for one do not see how we can have any\r\nthought of pity for the men whose memory we honor to-day. I do not\r\npity them. I envy them, rather, because their great work for liberty\r\nis accomplished, and we are in the midst of a work unfinished,\r\ntesting our strength where their strength already has been tested.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HERITAGE FROM THE DEAD\r\n\r\nThere is a touch of sorrow, but there is a touch of reassurance also\r\nin a day like this, because we know how the men of America have\r\nresponded to the call of the cause of liberty, and it fills our mind\r\nwith a perfect assurance that that response will come again in equal\r\nmeasures, with equal majesty and with a result which will hold the\r\nattention of all mankind.\r\n\r\nWhen you reflect upon it, these men who died to preserve the Union\r\ndied to preserve the instrument which we are now using to serve the\r\nworld--a free nation espousing the cause of human liberty. In one\r\nsense the great struggle into which we have now entered is an\r\nAmerican struggle, because it is in the sense of American honor and\r\nAmerican rights, but it is something even greater than that; it is a\r\nworld struggle. It is a struggle of men who love liberty everywhere;\r\nand in this cause America will show herself greater than ever because\r\nshe will rise to a greater thing.\r\n\r\nWe have said in the beginning that we planned this great Government\r\nthat men who wish freedom might have a place of refuge and a place\r\nwhere their hope could be realized, and now, having established such\r\na Government, having preserved such a Government, having vindicated\r\nthe power of such a Government, we are saying to all mankind, \"We did\r\nnot set this Government up in order that we might have a selfish and\r\nseparate liberty, for we are now ready to come to your assistance and\r\nfight out upon the fields of the world the cause of human liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA'S FULL FRUITION\r\n\r\nIn this thing America attains her full dignity and the full fruition\r\nof her great purpose.\r\n\r\nNo man can be glad that such things have happened as we have\r\nwitnessed in these last fateful years, but perhaps it may be\r\npermitted to us to be glad that we have an opportunity to show the\r\nprinciples which we profess to be living--principles which live in\r\nour hearts--and to have a chance by the pouring out of our blood and\r\ntreasure to vindicate the things which we have professed. For, my\r\nfriends, the real fruition of life is to do the things we have said\r\nwe wished to do. There are times when words seem empty and only\r\naction seems great. Such a time has come, and in the providence of\r\nGod America will once more have an opportunity to show to the world\r\nthat she was born to serve mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nA STATEMENT TO RUSSIA\r\n\r\n(_June 9, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the approaching visit of the American delegation to Russia\r\nto express the deep friendship of the American people for the people\r\nof Russia and to discuss the best and most practical means of\r\nco-operation between the two peoples in carrying the present struggle\r\nfor the freedom of all peoples to a successful consummation, it seems\r\nopportune and appropriate that I should state again, in the light of\r\nthis new partnership, the objects the United States has had in mind\r\nin entering the war. Those objects have been very much beclouded\r\nduring the past few weeks by mistaken and misleading statements, and\r\nthe issues at stake are too momentous, too tremendous, too\r\nsignificant for the whole human race to permit any misinterpretations\r\nor misunderstandings, however slight, to remain uncorrected for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe war has begun to go against Germany, and in their desperate\r\ndesire to escape the inevitable ultimate defeat, those who are in\r\nauthority in Germany are using every possible instrumentality, are\r\nmaking use even of the influence of groups and parties among their\r\nown subjects to whom they have never been just or fair, or even\r\ntolerant, to promote a propaganda on both sides of the sea which will\r\npreserve for them their influence at home and their power abroad, to\r\nthe undoing of the very men they are using.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA SEEKS NO CONQUEST\r\n\r\nThe position of America in this war is so clearly avowed that no man\r\ncan be excused for mistaking it. She seeks no material profit or\r\naggrandizement of any kind. She is fighting for no advantage or\r\nselfish object of her own, but for the liberation of peoples\r\neverywhere from the aggressions of autocratic force. The ruling\r\nclasses in Germany have begun of late to profess a like liberality\r\nand justice of purpose, but only to preserve the power they have set\r\nup in Germany and the selfish advantages which they have wrongly\r\ngained for themselves and their private projects of power all the way\r\nfrom Berlin to Bagdad and beyond. Government after Government has, by\r\ntheir influence, without open conquest of its territory, been linked\r\ntogether in a net of intrigue directed against nothing less than the\r\npeace and liberty of the world. The meshes of that intrigue must be\r\nbroken, but cannot be broken unless wrongs already done are undone;\r\nand adequate measures must be taken to prevent it from ever again\r\nbeing rewoven or repaired.\r\n\r\nOf course the Imperial German Government and those whom it is using\r\nfor their own undoing are seeking to obtain pledges that the war will\r\nend in the restoration of the _status quo ante_. It was the\r\n_status quo ante_ out of which this iniquitous war issued forth,\r\nthe power of the Imperial German Government within the empire and its\r\nwidespread domination and influence outside of that empire. That\r\nstatus must be altered in such fashion as to prevent any such hideous\r\nthing from ever happening again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE INVOLVED\r\n\r\nWe are fighting for the liberty, self-government and the undictated\r\ndevelopment of all peoples, and every feature of the settlement that\r\nconcludes this war must be conceived and executed for that purpose.\r\nWrongs must first be righted and then adequate safeguards must be\r\ncreated to prevent their being committed again. We ought not to\r\nconsider remedies merely because they have a pleasing and sonorous\r\nsound. Practical questions can be settled only by practical means.\r\nPhrases will not accomplish the result. Effective readjustments will;\r\nand whatever readjustments are necessary must be made.\r\n\r\nBut they must follow a principle, and that principle is plain:\r\n\r\nNo people must be forced under sovereignty under which it does not\r\nwish to live.\r\n\r\nNo territory must change hands except for the purpose of securing\r\nthose who inhabit it a fair chance of life and liberty.\r\n\r\nNo indemnities must be insisted on except those that constitute\r\npayment for manifest wrongs done.\r\n\r\nNo readjustments of power must be made except such as will tend to\r\nsecure the future peace of the world and the future welfare and\r\nhappiness of its peoples.\r\n\r\nAnd then the free peoples of the world must draw together in some\r\ncommon covenant, some genuine and practical co-operation, that will\r\nin effect combine their force to secure peace and justice in the\r\ndealings of nations with one another. The brotherhood of mankind must\r\nno longer be a fair but empty phrase; it must be given a structure of\r\nforce and reality. The nations must realize their common life and\r\neffect a workable partnership to secure that life against the\r\naggressions of autocratic and self-pleasing power.\r\n\r\nFor these things we can afford to pour out blood and treasure. For\r\nthese are the things we have always professed to desire, and unless\r\nwe pour out blood and treasure now and succeed, we may never be able\r\nto unite or show conquering force again in the great cause of human\r\nliberty. The day has come to conquer or submit. If the forces of\r\nautocracy can divide us, they will overcome us; if we stand together,\r\nvictory is certain and the liberty which victory will secure.\r\n\r\nWe can afford, then, to be generous, but we cannot afford then or now\r\nto be weak or omit any single guarantee of justice and security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nFLAG-DAY ADDRESS\r\n\r\n(_June 14, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow-citizens,--We meet to celebrate Flag Day because this flag\r\nwhich we honor and under which we serve is the emblem of our unity,\r\nour power, our thought and purpose as a nation. It has no other\r\ncharacter than that which we give it from generation to generation.\r\nThe choices are ours. It floats in majestic silence above the hosts\r\nthat execute those choices, whether in peace or in war. And yet,\r\nthough silent, it speaks to us--speaks to us of the past, of the men\r\nand women who went before us and of the records they wrote upon it.\r\nWe celebrate the day of its birth; and from its birth until now it\r\nhas witnessed a great history, has floated on high the symbol of\r\ngreat events, of a great plan of life worked out by a great people.\r\nWe are about to carry it into battle, to lift it where it will draw\r\nthe fire of our enemies. We are about to bid thousands, hundreds of\r\nthousands, it may be millions, of our men--the young, the strong, the\r\ncapable men of the nation--to go forth and die beneath it on fields\r\nof blood far away--for what? For some unaccustomed thing? For\r\nsomething for which it has never sought the fire before? American\r\narmies were never before sent across the seas. Why are they sent now?\r\nFor some new purpose, for which this great flag has never been\r\ncarried before, or for some old, familiar, heroic purpose for which\r\nit has seen men, its own men, die on every battlefield upon which\r\nAmericans have borne arms since the Revolution?\r\n\r\nThese are questions which must be answered. We are Americans. We in\r\nour turn serve America, and can serve her with no private purpose. We\r\nmust use her flag as she has always used it. We are accountable at\r\nthe bar of history and must plead in utter frankness what purpose it\r\nis we seek to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY WE ARE AT WAR\r\n\r\nIt is plain enough how we were forced into the war. The extraordinary\r\ninsults and aggressions of the Imperial German Government left us no\r\nself-respecting choice but to take up arms in defense of our rights\r\nas a free people and of our honor as a sovereign Government. The\r\nmilitary masters of Germany denied us the right to be neutral. They\r\nfilled our unsuspecting communities with vicious spies and\r\nconspirators and sought to corrupt the opinion of our people in their\r\nown behalf. When they found that they could not do that, their agents\r\ndiligently spread sedition among us and sought to draw our own\r\ncitizens from their allegiance--and some of those agents were men\r\nconnected with the official embassy of the German Government itself\r\nhere in our own capital. They sought by violence to destroy our own\r\nindustries and arrest our commerce. They tried to incite Mexico to\r\ntake up arms against us and to draw Japan into a hostile alliance\r\nwith her--and that, not by indirection, but by direct suggestion from\r\nthe Foreign Office in Berlin. They impudently denied us the use of\r\nthe seas and repeatedly executed their threat that they would send to\r\ntheir death any of our people who ventured to approach the coasts of\r\nEurope. And many of our own people were corrupted. Men began to look\r\nupon their own neighbors with suspicion and to wonder, in their hot\r\nresentment and surprise, whether there was any community in which\r\nhostile intrigue did not lurk. What great nation, in such\r\ncircumstances, would not have taken up arms? Much as we had desired\r\npeace, it was denied us, and not of our own choice. This flag under\r\nwhich we serve would have been dishonored had we withheld our hand.\r\n\r\nBut that is only part of the story. We know now as clearly as we knew\r\nbefore we were ourselves engaged that we are not the enemies of the\r\nGerman people and that they are not our enemies. They did not\r\noriginate or desire this hideous war or wish that we should be drawn\r\ninto it; and we are vaguely conscious that we are fighting their\r\ncause, as they will some day see it, as well as our own. They are\r\nthemselves in the grip of the same sinister power that has now at\r\nlast stretched its ugly talons out and drawn blood from us. The whole\r\nworld is at war because the whole world is in the grip of that power\r\nand is trying out the great battle which shall determine whether it\r\nis to be brought under its mastery or fling itself free.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONFLICT\r\n\r\nThe war was begun by the military masters of Germany, who proved to\r\nbe also the masters of Austria-Hungary. These men have never regarded\r\nnations as peoples, men, women and children of like blood and frame\r\nas themselves, for whom governments existed and in whom governments\r\nhad their life. They have regarded them merely as serviceable\r\norganizations which they could by force or intrigue bend or corrupt\r\nto their own purpose. They have regarded the smaller states, in\r\nparticular, and the peoples who could be overwhelmed by force, as\r\ntheir natural tools and instruments of domination. Their purpose has\r\nlong been avowed. The statesmen of other nations, to whom that\r\npurpose was incredible, paid little attention; regarded what German\r\nprofessors expounded in their class-rooms and German writers set\r\nforth to the world as the goal of German policy as rather the dream\r\nof minds detached from practical affairs, as preposterous private\r\nconceptions of German destiny, than as the actual plans of\r\nresponsible rulers; but the rulers of Germany themselves knew all the\r\nwhile what concrete plans, what well-advanced intrigues, lay back of\r\nwhat the professors and the writers were saying, and were glad to go\r\nforward unmolested, filling the thrones of Balkan states with German\r\nprinces, putting German officers at the service of Turkey to drill\r\nher armies and make interest with her Government, developing plans of\r\nsedition and rebellion in India and Egypt, setting their fires in\r\nPersia. The demands made by Austria upon Serbia were a mere single\r\nstep in a plan which compassed Europe and Asia, from Berlin to\r\nBagdad. They hoped those demands might not arouse Europe, but they\r\nmeant to press them whether they did or not, for they thought\r\nthemselves ready for the final issue of arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLAN OF CONQUEST\r\n\r\nTheir plan was to throw a broad belt of German military power and\r\npolitical control across the very center of Europe and beyond the\r\nMediterranean into the very heart of Asia; and Austria-Hungary was to\r\nbe as much their tool and pawn as Serbia or Bulgaria or Turkey or the\r\nponderous states of the East. Austria-Hungary, indeed, was to become\r\npart of the central German Empire, absorbed and dominated by the same\r\nforces and influences that had originally cemented the German states\r\nthemselves. The dream had its heart at Berlin. It could have had a\r\nheart nowhere else! It rejected the idea of solidarity of race\r\nentirely. The choice of peoples played no part in it at all. It\r\ncontemplated binding together racial and political units which could\r\nbe kept together only by force--Czechs, Magyars, Croats, Serbs,\r\nRumanians, Turks, Armenians--the proud states of Bohemia and Hungary,\r\nthe stout little commonwealths of the Balkans, the indomitable Turks,\r\nthe subtile peoples of the East. These peoples did not wish to be\r\nunited. They ardently desired to direct their own affairs, would be\r\nsatisfied only by undisputed independence. They could be kept quiet\r\nonly by the presence or the constant threat of armed men. They would\r\nlive under a common power only by sheer compulsion and await the day\r\nof revolution. But the German military statesmen had reckoned with\r\nall that and were ready to deal with it in their own way.\r\n\r\nAnd they have actually carried the greater part of that amazing plan\r\ninto execution! Look how things stand. Austria is at their mercy. It\r\nhas acted, not upon its own initiative or upon the choice of its own\r\npeople, but at Berlin's dictation, ever since the war began. Its\r\npeople now desire peace, but cannot have it until leave is granted\r\nfrom Berlin. The so-called Central Powers are, in fact, but a single\r\nPower. Serbia is at its mercy, should its hand be but for a moment\r\nfreed. Bulgaria has consented to its will, and Rumania is overrun.\r\nThe Turkish armies, which Germans trained, are serving Germany,\r\ncertainly not themselves, and the guns of German warships lying in\r\nthe harbor at Constantinople remind Turkish statesmen every day that\r\nthey have no choice but to take their orders from Berlin. From\r\nHamburg to the Persian Gulf the net is spread.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TALK OF PEACE\r\n\r\nIs it not easy to understand the eagerness for peace that has been\r\nmanifested from Berlin ever since the snare was set and sprung?\r\nPeace, peace, peace has been the talk of her Foreign Office for now a\r\nyear and more; not peace upon her own initiative, but upon the\r\ninitiative of the nations over which she now deems herself to hold\r\nthe advantage. A little of the talk has been public, but most of it\r\nhas been private. Through all sorts of channels it has come to me,\r\nand in all sorts of guises, but never with the terms disclosed which\r\nthe German Government would be willing to accept. That Government has\r\nother valuable pawns in its hands besides those I have mentioned. It\r\nstill holds a valuable part of France, though with slowly relaxing\r\ngrasp, and practically the whole of Belgium. Its armies press close\r\nupon Russia and overrun Poland at their will. It cannot go farther;\r\nit dare not go back. It wishes to close its bargain before it is too\r\nlate, and it has little left to offer for the pound of flesh it will\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nThe military masters under whom Germany is bleeding see very clearly\r\nto what point Fate has brought them. If they fall back or are forced\r\nback an inch, their power both abroad and at home will fall to pieces\r\nlike a house of cards. It is their power at home they are thinking\r\nabout now more than their power abroad. It is that power which is\r\ntrembling under their very feet; and deep fear has entered their\r\nhearts. They have but one chance to perpetuate their military power,\r\nor even their controlling political influence. If they can secure\r\npeace now, with the immense advantages still in their hands which\r\nthey have up to this point apparently gained, they will have\r\njustified themselves before the German people; they will have gained\r\nby force what they promised to gain by it--an immense expansion of\r\nGerman power, an immense enlargement of German industrial and\r\ncommercial opportunities. Their prestige will be secure, and with\r\ntheir prestige their political power. If they fail, their people will\r\nthrust them aside; a government accountable to the people themselves\r\nwill be set up in Germany, as it has been in England, in the United\r\nStates, in France, and in all the great countries of the modern time\r\nexcept Germany. If they succeed they are safe and Germany and the\r\nworld are undone; if they fail Germany is saved and the world will be\r\nat peace. If they succeed, America will fall within the menace. We\r\nand all the rest of the world must remain armed, as they will remain,\r\nand must make ready for the next step in their aggression; if they\r\nfail, the world may unite for peace and Germany may be of the union.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT AIM OF GERMANY\r\n\r\nDo you not now understand the new intrigue, the intrigue for peace,\r\nand why the masters of Germany do not hesitate to use any agency that\r\npromises to effect their purpose, the deceit of the nations? Their\r\npresent particular aim is to deceive all those who throughout the\r\nworld stand for the rights of peoples and the self-government of\r\nnations; for they see what immense strength the forces of justice and\r\nof liberalism are gathering out of this war. They are employing\r\nliberals in their enterprise. They are using men, in Germany and\r\nwithout, as their spokesmen whom they have hitherto despised and\r\noppressed, using them for their own destruction--socialists, the\r\nleaders of labor, the thinkers they have hitherto sought to silence.\r\nLet them once succeed and these men, now their tools, will be ground\r\nto powder beneath the weight of the great military empire they will\r\nhave set up; the revolutionists in Russia will be cut off from all\r\nsuccor or co-operation in western Europe and a counter revolution\r\nfostered and supported; Germany herself will lose her chance of\r\nfreedom; and all Europe will arm for the next, the final struggle.\r\n\r\nThe sinister intrigue is being no less actively conducted in this\r\ncountry than in Russia, and in every country in Europe to which the\r\nagents and dupes of the Imperial German Government can get access.\r\nThat Government has many spokesmen here, in places high and low. They\r\nhave learned discretion. They keep within the law. It is opinion they\r\nutter now, not sedition. They proclaim the liberal purposes of their\r\nmasters; declare this a foreign war which can touch America with no\r\ndanger to either her lands or her institutions; set England at the\r\ncenter of the stage and talk of her ambition to assert economic\r\ndominion throughout the world; appeal to our ancient tradition of\r\nisolation in the politics of the nations; and seek to undermine the\r\nGovernment with false professions of loyalty to its principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A PEOPLES' WAR\r\n\r\nBut they will make no headway. The false betray themselves always in\r\nevery accent. It is only friends and partisans of the German\r\nGovernment whom we have already identified who utter these thinly\r\ndisguised disloyalties. The facts are patent to all the world, and\r\nnowhere are they more plainly seen than in the United States, where\r\nwe are accustomed to deal with facts and not with sophistries; and\r\nthe great fact that stands out above all the rest is that this is a\r\nPeoples' War, a war for freedom and justice and self-government\r\namongst all the nations of the world, a war to make the world safe\r\nfor the peoples who live in it and have made it their own, the German\r\npeople themselves included; and that with us rests the choice to\r\nbreak through all these hypocrisies and patent cheats and masks of\r\nbrute force and help set the world free, or else stand aside and let\r\nit be dominated a long age through by sheer weight of arms and the\r\narbitrary choices of self-constituted masters, by the nation which\r\ncan maintain the biggest armies and the most irresistible\r\narmaments--a power to which the world has afforded no parallel and in\r\nthe face of which political freedom must wither and perish.\r\n\r\nFor us there is but one choice. We have made it. Woe be to the man or\r\ngroup of men that seeks to stand in our way in this day of high\r\nresolution, when every principle we hold dearest is to be vindicated\r\nand made secure for the salvation of the nations. We are ready to\r\nplead at the bar of history, and our flag shall wear a new luster.\r\nOnce more we shall make good with our lives and fortunes the great\r\nfaith to which we were born, and a new glory shall shine in the face\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nAN APPEAL TO THE BUSINESS INTERESTS\r\n\r\n(_July 11, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow-countrymen,--The Government is about to attempt to\r\ndetermine the prices at which it will ask you henceforth to furnish\r\nvarious supplies which are necessary for the prosecution of the war,\r\nand various materials which will be needed in the industries by which\r\nthe war must be sustained.\r\n\r\nWe shall, of course, try to determine them justly and to the best\r\nadvantage of the nation as a whole. But justice is easier to speak of\r\nthan to arrive at, and there are some considerations which I hope we\r\nshall keep steadily in mind while this particular problem of justice\r\nis being worked out.\r\n\r\nI therefore take the liberty of stating very candidly my own view of\r\nthe situation and of the principles which should guide both the\r\nGovernment and the mine-owners and manufacturers of the country in\r\nthis difficult matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRIOTISM AND PROFITS APART\r\n\r\nA just price must, of course, be paid for everything the Government\r\nbuys. By a just price I mean a price which will sustain the\r\nindustries concerned in a high state of efficiency, provide a living\r\nfor those who conduct them, enable them to pay good wages, and make\r\npossible the expansions of their enterprises, which will from time to\r\ntime become necessary as the stupendous undertakings of this great\r\nwar develop.\r\n\r\nWe could not wisely or reasonably do less than pay such prices. They\r\nare necessary for the maintenance and development of industry; and\r\nthe maintenance and development of industry are necessary for the\r\ngreat task we have in hand.\r\n\r\nBut I trust that we shall not surround the matter with a mist of\r\nsentiment. Facts are our masters now. We ought not to put the\r\nacceptance of such prices on the ground of patriotism. Patriotism has\r\nnothing to do with profits in a case like this. Patriotism and\r\nprofits ought never in the present circumstances to be mentioned\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly proper to discuss profits as a matter of business,\r\nwith a view to maintaining the integrity of capital and the\r\nefficiency of labor in these tragical months, when the liberty of\r\nfree men everywhere and of industry itself trembles in the balance,\r\nbut it would be absurd to discuss them as a motive for helping to\r\nserve and save our country.\r\n\r\nPatriotism leaves profits out of the question. In these days of our\r\nsupreme trial, when we are sending hundreds of thousands of our young\r\nmen across the seas to serve a great cause, no true man who stays\r\nbehind to work for them and sustain them by his labor will ask\r\nhimself what he is personally going to make out of that labor.\r\n\r\nNo true patriot will permit himself to take toll of their heroism in\r\nmoney or seek to grow rich by the shedding of their blood. He will\r\ngive as freely and with as unstinted self-sacrifice as they. When\r\nthey are giving their lives, will he not at least give his money?\r\n\r\nI hear it insisted that more than a just price, more than a price\r\nthat will sustain our industries, must be paid; that it is necessary\r\nto pay very liberal and unusual profits in order to \"stimulate\r\nproduction,\" that nothing but pecuniary rewards will do--rewards paid\r\nin money, not in the mere liberation of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS A BRIBE NECESSARY?\r\n\r\nI take it for granted that those who argue thus do not stop to think\r\nwhat that means. Do they mean that you must be paid, must be bribed,\r\nto make your contribution, a contribution that costs you neither a\r\ndrop of blood, nor a tear, when the whole world is in travail and men\r\neverywhere depend upon and call to you to bring them out of bondage\r\nand make the world a fit place to live in again amidst peace and\r\njustice?\r\n\r\nDo they mean that you will exact a price, drive a bargain, with the\r\nmen who are enduring the agony of this war on the battlefield, in the\r\ntrenches, amid the lurking dangers of the sea, or with the bereaved\r\nwomen and pitiful children, before you will come forward to do your\r\nduty and give some part of your life, in easy, peaceful fashion, for\r\nthe things we are fighting for, the things we have pledged our\r\nfortunes, our lives, our sacred honor, to vindicate and\r\ndefend--liberty and justice and fair dealing and the peace of\r\nnations?\r\n\r\nOf course you will not. It is inconceivable. Your patriotism is of\r\nthe same self-denying stuff as the patriotism of the men dead or\r\nmaimed on the fields of France, or else it is no patriotism at all.\r\nLet us never speak, then, of profits and of patriotism in the same\r\nsentence, but face facts and meet them. Let us do sound business, but\r\nnot in the midst of a mist.\r\n\r\nMany a grievous burden of taxation will be laid on this Nation, in\r\nthis generation and in the next, to pay for this war; let us see to\r\nit that for every dollar that is taken from the people's pockets it\r\nshall be possible to obtain a dollar's worth of the sound stuffs they\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH FREIGHTS AID GERMANY\r\n\r\nLet us for a moment turn to the ship-owners of the United States and\r\nthe other ocean carriers whose example they have followed, and ask\r\nthem if they realize what obstacles, what almost insuperable\r\nobstacles, they have been putting in the way of the successful\r\nprosecution of this war by the ocean freight rates they have been\r\nexacting.\r\n\r\nThey are doing everything that high freight charges can do to make\r\nthe war a failure, to make it impossible. I do not say that they\r\nrealize this or intend it.\r\n\r\nThe thing has happened naturally enough, because the commercial\r\nprocesses which we are content to see operate in ordinary times have\r\nwithout sufficient thought been continued into a period where they\r\nhave no proper place. I am not questioning motives. I am merely\r\nstating a fact, and stating it in order that attention may be fixed\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that those who have fixed war freight rates have taken\r\nthe most effective means in their power to defeat the armies engaged\r\nagainst Germany. When they realize this we may, I take it for\r\ngranted, count upon them to reconsider the whole matter. It is high\r\ntime. Their extra hazards are covered by war-risk insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW TO DEAL WITH OFFENDERS\r\n\r\nI know, and you know, what response to this great challenge of duty\r\nand of opportunity the Nation will expect of you; and I know what\r\nresponse you will make. Those who do not respond, who do not respond\r\nin the spirit of those who have gone to give their lives for us on\r\nbloody fields far away, may safely be left to be dealt with by\r\nopinion and the law--for the law must, of course, command those\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nI am dealing with the matter thus publicly and frankly, not because I\r\nhave any doubt or fear as to the result, but only in order that, in\r\nall our thinking and in all our dealings with one another we may move\r\nin a perfectly clear air of mutual understanding.\r\n\r\nAnd there is something more that we must add to our thinking. The\r\npublic is now as much part of the Government as are the Army and Navy\r\nthemselves. The whole people, in all their activities, are now\r\nmobilized and in service for the accomplishment of the Nation's task\r\nin this war. It is in such circumstances impossible justly to\r\ndistinguish between industrial purchases made by the Government and\r\nindustries. And it is just as much our duty to sustain the industries\r\nof the country, all the industries that contribute to its life, as it\r\nis to sustain our forces in the field and on the sea. We must make\r\nthe prices to the public the same as the prices to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES MEAN VICTORY OR DEFEAT\r\n\r\nPrices mean the same thing everywhere now. They mean the efficiency\r\nor the inefficiency of the Nation, whether it is the Government that\r\npays them or not. They mean victory or defeat. They mean that America\r\nwill win her place once for all among the foremost free Nations of\r\nthe world, or that she will sink to defeat and become a second-rate\r\nPower alike in thought and action. This is a day of her reckoning,\r\nand every man among us must personally face that reckoning along with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe case needs no arguing. I assume that I am only expressing your\r\nown thoughts--what must be in the mind of every true man when he\r\nfaces the tragedy and the solemn glory of the present war, for the\r\nemancipation of mankind. I summon you to a great duty, a great\r\nprivilege, a shining dignity and distinction.\r\n\r\nI shall expect every man who is not a slacker to be at my side\r\nthroughout this great enterprise. In it no man can win honor who\r\nthinks of himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE COMMUNICATION OF THE POPE TO THE\r\nBELLIGERENT GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\n(_August 27, 1917_)\r\n\r\nTo His Holiness Benedictus XV., Pope.\r\n\r\nIn acknowledgment of the communication of Your Holiness to the\r\nbelligerent peoples, dated August 1, 1917, the President of the\r\nUnited States requests me to transmit the following reply:\r\n\r\nEvery heart that has not been blinded and hardened by this terrible\r\nwar must be touched by this moving appeal of His Holiness, the Pope,\r\nmust feel the dignity and force of the humane and generous motives\r\nwhich prompted it, and must fervently wish that we might take the\r\npath of peace he so persuasively points out. But it would be folly to\r\ntake it if it does not, in fact, lead to the goal he proposes. Our\r\nresponse must be based upon the stern facts and upon nothing else. It\r\nis not a mere cessation of arms he desires; it is a stable and\r\nenduring peace. This agony must not be gone through with again, and\r\nit must be a matter of very sober judgment what will insure us\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSAL FROM THE VATICAN\r\n\r\nHis Holiness, in substance, proposes that we return to the _status\r\nquo ante bellum_, and that then there be a general condonation,\r\ndisarmament, and a concert of nations based upon an acceptance of the\r\nprinciple of arbitration; that by a similar concert freedom of the\r\nseas be established; and that the territorial claims of France and\r\nItaly, the perplexing problems of the Balkan states, and the\r\nrestitution of Poland be left to such conciliatory adjustments as may\r\nbe possible in the new temper of such a peace, due regard being paid\r\nto the aspirations of the peoples whose political fortunes and\r\naffiliations will be involved.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that no part of this program can be successfully\r\ncarried out unless the restitution of the _status quo ante_\r\nfurnishes a firm and satisfactory basis for it. The object of this\r\nwar is to deliver the free peoples of the world from the menace and\r\nthe actual power of a vast military establishment controlled by an\r\nirresponsible Government, which, having secretly planned to dominate\r\nthe world, proceeded to carry the plan out without regard either to\r\nthe sacred obligations of treaty or the long-established practices\r\nand long-cherished principles of international action and honor;\r\nwhich chose its own time for the war; delivered its blow fiercely and\r\nsuddenly; stopped at no barrier either of law or of mercy; swept a\r\nwhole continent within the tide of blood--not the blood of soldiers\r\nonly, but the blood of innocent women and children also, and of the\r\nhelpless poor; and now stands balked but not defeated, the enemy of\r\nfour-fifths of the world. This power is not the German people. It is\r\nthe ruthless master of the German people. It is no business of ours\r\nhow that great people came under its control or submitted with\r\ntemporary zest to the domination of its purpose; but it is our\r\nbusiness to see to it that the history of the rest of the world is no\r\nlonger left to its handling.\r\n\r\nTo deal with such a power by way of peace upon the plan proposed by\r\nHis Holiness the Pope would, so far as we can see, involve a\r\nrecuperation of its strength and a renewal of its policy; would make\r\nit necessary to create a permanent hostile combination of nations\r\nagainst the German people who are its instruments; and would result\r\nin abandoning the new-born Russia to the intrigue, the manifold\r\nsubtle interference, and the certain counter-revolution which would\r\nbe attempted by all the malign influences to which the German\r\nGovernment has of late accustomed the world. Can peace be based upon\r\na restitution of its power or upon any word of honor it could pledge\r\nin a treaty of settlement and accommodation?\r\n\r\nResponsible statesmen must now everywhere see, if they never saw\r\nbefore, that no peace can rest securely upon political or economic\r\nrestrictions meant to benefit some nations and cripple or embarrass\r\nothers, upon vindictive action of any sort, or any kind of revenge or\r\ndeliberate injury. The American people have suffered intolerable\r\nwrongs at the hands of the Imperial German Government, but they\r\ndesire no reprisal upon the German people, who have themselves\r\nsuffered all things in this war which they did not choose. They\r\nbelieve that peace should rest upon the rights of peoples, not the\r\nrights of governments--the rights of peoples great or small, weak or\r\npowerful--their equal right to freedom and security and\r\nself-government and to a participation upon fair terms in the\r\neconomic opportunities of the world, the German people, of course,\r\nincluded, if they will accept equality and not seek domination.\r\n\r\nThe test, therefore, of every plan of peace is this: Is it based upon\r\nthe faith of all the peoples involved or merely upon the word of an\r\nambitious and intriguing Government on the one hand, and of a group\r\nof free peoples on the other? This is a test which goes to the root\r\nof the matter; and it is the test which must be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEST THAT MUST BE APPLIED\r\n\r\nThe purposes of the United States in this war are known to the whole\r\nworld, to every people to whom the truth has been permitted to come.\r\nThey do not need to be stated again. We seek no material advantage of\r\nany kind. We believe that the intolerable wrongs done in this war by\r\nthe furious and brutal power of the Imperial German Government ought\r\nto be repaired, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of any\r\npeople--rather a vindication of the sovereignty both of those that\r\nare weak and of those that are strong. Punitive damages, the\r\ndismemberment of empires, the establishment of selfish and exclusive\r\neconomic leagues, we deem inexpedient and in the end worse than\r\nfutile, no proper basis for a peace of any kind, least of all for an\r\nenduring peace. That must be based upon justice and fairness and the\r\ncommon rights of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN RULERS CANNOT BE TRUSTED\r\n\r\nWe cannot take the word of the present rulers of Germany as a\r\nguaranty of anything that is to endure, unless explicitly supported\r\nby such conclusive evidence of the will and purpose of the German\r\npeople themselves as the other peoples of the world would be\r\njustified in accepting. Without such guarantees treaties of\r\nsettlement, agreements for disarmament, covenants to set up\r\narbitration in the place of force, territorial adjustments,\r\nreconstitutions of small nations, if made with the German Government,\r\nno man, no nation could now depend on. We must await some new\r\nevidence of the purposes of the great peoples of the Central Powers.\r\nGod grant it may be given soon, and in a way to restore the\r\nconfidence of all peoples everywhere in the faith of nations and the\r\npossibility of a covenanted peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT LANSING,\r\n\r\nSecretary of State of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nA MESSAGE TO TEACHERS AND SCHOOL OFFICERS\r\n\r\n(_September 30, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war is bringing to the minds of our people a new appreciation of\r\nthe problems of national life and a deeper understanding of the\r\nmeaning and aims of democracy. Matters which heretofore have seemed\r\ncommonplace and trivial are seen in a truer light. The urgent demand\r\nfor the production and proper distribution of food and other national\r\nresources has made us aware of the close dependence of individual on\r\nindividual and nation on nation. The effort to keep up social and\r\nindustrial organizations, in spite of the withdrawal of men for the\r\narmy, has revealed the extent to which modern life has become complex\r\nand specialized.\r\n\r\nThese and other lessons of the war must be learned quickly if we are\r\nintelligently and successfully to defend our institutions. When the\r\nwar is over we must apply the wisdom which we have acquired in\r\npurging and ennobling the life of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON SCHOOL HAS A PART TO PLAY\r\n\r\nIn these vital tasks of acquiring a broader view of human\r\npossibilities the common school must have large part. I urge that\r\nteachers and other school officers increase materially the time and\r\nattention devoted to instruction bearing directly on the problems of\r\ncommunity and national life.\r\n\r\nSuch a plea is in no way foreign to the spirit of American public\r\neducation or of existing practices. Nor is it a plea for a temporary\r\nenlargement of the school program appropriate merely to the period of\r\nthe war. It is a plea for a realization in public education of the\r\nnew emphasis which the war has given to the ideals of democracy and\r\nto the broader conceptions of national life.\r\n\r\nIn order that there may be definite material at hand with which the\r\nschools may at once expand their teachings, I have asked Mr. Hoover\r\nand Commissioner Claxton to organize the proper agencies for the\r\npreparation and distribution of suitable lessons for the elementary\r\ngrades and for the high-school classes. Lessons thus suggested will\r\nserve the double purpose of illustrating in a concrete way what can\r\nbe undertaken in the schools and of stimulating teachers in all parts\r\nof the country to formulate new and appropriate materials drawn\r\ndirectly from the communities in which they live.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE MUST COME NOW\r\n\r\n(_October 25, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President received at the White House a delegation from the New\r\nYork State Woman Suffrage Party. Answering the address made by the\r\nchairman, Mrs. Norman de R. Whitehouse, the President spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nMrs. Whitehouse and Ladies,--It is with great pleasure that\r\nI receive you. I esteem it a privilege to do so. I know the\r\ndifficulties which you have been laboring under in New York State, so\r\nclearly set forth by Mrs. Whitehouse, but in my judgment those\r\ndifficulties cannot be used as an excuse by the leaders of any party\r\nor by the voters of any party for neglecting the question which you\r\nare pressing upon them. Because, after all, the whole world now is\r\nwitnessing a struggle between two ideals of government. It is a\r\nstruggle which goes deeper and touches more of the foundations of the\r\norganized life of men than any struggle that has ever taken place\r\nbefore, and no settlement of the questions that lie on the surface\r\ncan satisfy a situation which requires that the questions which lie\r\nunderneath and at the foundation should also be settled and settled\r\nright. I am free to say that I think the question of woman suffrage\r\nis one of those questions which lie at the foundation.\r\n\r\nThe world has witnessed a slow political reconstruction, and men have\r\ngenerally been obliged to be satisfied with the slowness of the\r\nprocess. In a sense it is wholesome that it should be slow, because\r\nthen it is solid and sure. But I believe that this war is going so to\r\nquicken the convictions and the consciousness of mankind with regard\r\nto political questions that the speed of reconstruction will be\r\ngreatly increased. And I believe that just because we are quickened\r\nby the questions of this war, we ought to be quickened to give this\r\nquestion of woman suffrage our immediate consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW IS THE TIME TO ACT\r\n\r\nAs one of the spokesmen of a great party, I would be doing nothing\r\nless than obeying the mandates of that party if I gave my hearty\r\nsupport to the question of woman suffrage which you represent, but I\r\ndo not want to speak merely as one of the spokesmen of a party. I\r\nwant to speak for myself, and say that it seems to me that this is\r\nthe time for the States of this Union to take this action. I perhaps\r\nmay be touched a little too much by the traditions of our politics,\r\ntraditions which lay such questions almost entirely upon the States,\r\nbut I want to see communities declare themselves quickened at this\r\ntime and show the consequence of the quickening.\r\n\r\nI think the whole country has appreciated the way in which the women\r\nhave risen to this great occasion. They not only have done what they\r\nhave been asked to do, and done it with ardor and efficiency, but\r\nthey have shown a power to organize for doing things of their own\r\ninitiative, which is quite a different thing, and a very much more\r\ndifficult thing, and I think the whole country has admired the spirit\r\nand the capacity and the vision of the women of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is almost absurd to say that the country depends upon the women\r\nfor a large part of the inspiration of its life. That is too obvious\r\nto say; but it is now depending upon the women also for suggestions\r\nof service, which have been rendered in abundance and with the\r\ndistinction of originality. I, therefore, am very glad to add my\r\nvoice to those which are urging the people of the great State of New\r\nYork to set a great example by voting for woman suffrage. It would be\r\na pleasure if I might utter that advice in their presence. Inasmuch\r\nas I am bound too close to my duties here to make that possible, I am\r\nglad to have the privilege to ask you to convey that message to them.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this is a time of privilege. All our principles,\r\nall our hearts, all our purposes, are being searched; searched not\r\nonly by our own consciences, but searched by the world; and it is\r\ntime for the people of the States of this country to show the world\r\nin what practical sense they have learned the lessons of\r\ndemocracy--that they are fighting for democracy because they believe\r\nit, and that there is no application of democracy which they do not\r\nbelieve in.\r\n\r\nI feel, therefore, that I am standing upon the firmest foundations of\r\nthe age in bidding godspeed to the cause which you represent and in\r\nexpressing the ardent hope that the people of New York may realize\r\nthe great occasion which faces them on Election Day and may respond\r\nto it in noble fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE THANKSGIVING DAY PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n(_November 7, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been the honored custom of our people to turn in the\r\nfruitful autumn of the year in praise and thanksgiving to Almighty\r\nGod for His many blessings and mercies to us as a Nation. That custom\r\nwe can follow now, even in the midst of the tragedy of a world shaken\r\nby war and immeasurable disaster, in the midst of sorrow and great\r\nperil, because even amidst the darkness that has gathered about us we\r\ncan see the great blessings God has bestowed upon us; blessings that\r\nare better than mere peace of mind and prosperity of enterprise.\r\n\r\nWe have been given the opportunity to serve mankind as we once served\r\nourselves in the great day of our declaration of independence, by\r\ntaking up arms against a tyranny that threatened to master and debase\r\nmen everywhere and joining with other free peoples in demanding for\r\nall the nations of the world what we then demanded and obtained for\r\nourselves. In this day of the revelation of our duty not only to\r\ndefend our rights as a Nation, but to defend also the rights of free\r\nmen throughout the world, there has been vouchsafed us in full and\r\ninspiring measure the resolution and spirit of united action. We have\r\nbeen brought to one mind and purpose. A new vigor of common counsel\r\nand common action has been revealed in us.\r\n\r\nWe should especially thank God that, in such circumstances, in the\r\nmidst of the greatest enterprise the spirits of men have ever entered\r\nupon, we have, if we but observe a reasonable and practicable\r\neconomy, abundance with which to supply the needs of those associated\r\nwith us as well as our own.\r\n\r\nA new light shines about us. The great duties of a new day awaken a\r\nnew and greater national spirit in us. We shall never again be\r\ndivided or wonder what stuff we are made of.\r\n\r\nAnd while we render thanks for these things, let us pray Almighty God\r\nthat in all humbleness of spirit we may look always to Him for\r\nguidance; that we may be kept constant in the spirit and purpose of\r\nservice; that by His grace our minds may be directed and our hands\r\nstrengthened, and that in His good time liberty and security and\r\npeace and the comradeship of a common justice may be vouchsafed all\r\nthe nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nWherefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby designate Thursday, the 29th day of November next,\r\nas a day of thanksgiving and prayer, and invite the people throughout\r\nthe land to cease upon that day from their ordinary occupations and\r\nin their several homes and places of worship to render thanks to God,\r\nthe Great Ruler of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nLABOR MUST BEAR ITS PART\r\n\r\n(_November 12, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his address before the American Federation of Labor, assembled in\r\nconvention at Buffalo, New York, the President spoke as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. President, Delegates of the American Federation of Labor, Ladies\r\nand Gentlemen,--I esteem it a great privilege and a real honor to be\r\nthus admitted to your public councils. When your executive committee\r\npaid me the compliment of inviting me here I gladly accepted the\r\ninvitation, because it seems to me that this, above all other times\r\nin your history, is the time for common counsel, for the drawing not\r\nonly of the energies, but of the minds of the nation together. I\r\nthought that it was a welcome opportunity for disclosing to you some\r\nof the thoughts that have been gathering in my mind during the last\r\nmomentous months.\r\n\r\nI am introduced to you as the President of the United States, and yet\r\nI would be pleased if you would put the thought of the office into\r\nthe background and regard me as one of your fellow-citizens who has\r\ncome here to speak, not the words of authority, but the words of\r\ncounsel, the words which men should speak to one another who wish to\r\nbe frank in a moment more critical, perhaps, than the history of the\r\nworld has ever yet known, a moment when it is every man's duty to\r\nforget himself, to forget his own interests, to fill himself with the\r\nnobility of a great national and world conception and act upon a new\r\nplatform elevated above the ordinary affairs of life, elevated to\r\nwhere men have views of the long destiny of mankind.\r\n\r\nI think that in order to realize just what this moment of counsel is,\r\nit is very desirable that we should remind ourselves just how this\r\nwar came about and just what it is for. You can explain most wars\r\nvery simply, but the explanation of this is not so simple. Its roots\r\nrun deep into all the obscure soils of history, and, in my view, this\r\nis the last decisive issue between the old principles of power and\r\nthe new principles of freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe war was started by Germany. Her authorities deny that they\r\nstarted it, but I am willing to let the statement I have just made\r\nawait the verdict of history. The thing that needs to be explained is\r\nwhy Germany started the war. Remember what the position of Germany in\r\nthe world was--as enviable a position as any nation has ever\r\noccupied. The whole world stood at admiration of her wonderful\r\nintellectual and material achievements, and all the intellectual men\r\nof the world went to school to her. As a university man I have been\r\nsurrounded by men trained in Germany, men who had resorted to Germany\r\nbecause nowhere else could they get such thorough and searching\r\ntraining, particularly in the principles of science and the\r\nprinciples that underlie modern material achievements.\r\n\r\nHer men of science had made her industries perhaps the most competent\r\nindustries in the world, and the label, \"Made in Germany,\" was a\r\nguarantee of good workmanship and of sound material. She had access\r\nto all the markets of the world, and every other man who traded in\r\nthose markets feared Germany because of her effective and almost\r\nirresistible competition. She had a place in the sun. Why was she not\r\nsatisfied? What more did she want? There was nothing in the world of\r\npeace that she did not already have, and have in abundance.\r\n\r\nWe boast of the extraordinary pace of American advancement. We show\r\nwith pride the statistics of the increase of our industries and of\r\nthe population of our cities. Well, those statistics did not match\r\nthe recent statistics of Germany. Her old cities took on youth, grew\r\nfaster than any American cities ever grew; her old industries opened\r\ntheir eyes and saw a new world and went out for its conquest, and yet\r\nthe authorities of Germany were not satisfied.\r\n\r\nYou have one part of the answer to the question why she was not\r\nsatisfied in her methods of competition. There is no important\r\nindustry in Germany upon which the Government had not laid its hands\r\nto direct it and, when necessity arose, control it.\r\n\r\nYou have only to ask any man whom you meet who is familiar with the\r\nconditions that prevailed before the war in the matter of\r\ninternational competition to find out the methods of competition\r\nwhich the German manufacturers and exporters used under the patronage\r\nand support of the Government of Germany. You will find that they\r\nwere the same sorts of competition that we have decided to prevent by\r\nlaw within our own borders. If they could not sell their goods\r\ncheaper than we could sell ours, at a profit to themselves, they\r\ncould get a subsidy from the Government which made it possible to\r\nsell them cheaper anyhow; and the conditions of competition were thus\r\ncontrolled in large measure by the German Government itself.\r\n\r\nBut that did not satisfy the German Government. All the while there\r\nwas lying behind its thought, in its dreams of the future, a\r\npolitical control which would enable it, in the long run, to dominate\r\nthe labor and the industry of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESS BY AUTHORITY\r\n\r\nThey were not content with success by superior achievement; they\r\nwanted success by authority. I suppose very few of you have thought\r\nmuch about the Berlin to Bagdad railway. The Berlin to Bagdad railway\r\nwas constructed in order to run the threat of force down the flank of\r\nthe industrial undertakings of half a dozen other countries, so that\r\nwhen German competition came in it would not be resisted too\r\nfar--because there was always the possibility of getting German\r\narmies into the heart of that country quicker than any other armies\r\ncould be got there.\r\n\r\nLook at the map of Europe now. Germany, in thrusting upon us again\r\nand again the discussion of peace, talks about what? Talks about\r\nBelgium, talks about northern France, talks about Alsace-Lorraine.\r\nShe has kept all that her dreams contemplated when the war began. If\r\nshe can keep that, her power can disturb the world as long as she\r\nkeeps it; always provided--for I feel bound to put this provision\r\nin--always provided the present influences that control the German\r\nGovernment continue to control it.\r\n\r\nI believe that the spirit of freedom can get into the hearts of\r\nGermans and find as fine a welcome there as it can find in any other\r\nhearts. But the spirit of freedom does not suit the plans of the\r\nPan-Germans. Power cannot be used with concentrated force against\r\nfree peoples if it is used by free people. You know how many\r\nintimations come to us from one of the Central Powers that it is more\r\nanxious for peace than the chief Central Power, and you know that it\r\nmeans that the people in that Central Power know that if the war ends\r\nas it stands, they will in effect themselves be vassals of Germany,\r\nnotwithstanding that their populations are compounded with all the\r\npeople of that part of the world, and notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthey do not wish, in their pride and proper spirit of nationality, to\r\nbe so absorbed and dominated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL POWER OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\nGermany is determined that the political power of the world shall\r\nbelong to her. There have been such ambitions before. They have been\r\nin part realized. But never before have those ambitions been based\r\nupon so exact and precise and scientific a plan of domination.\r\n\r\nMay I not say it is amazing to me that any group of people should be\r\nso ill informed as to suppose, as some groups in Russia apparently\r\nsuppose, that any reforms planned in the interest of the people can\r\nlive in the presence of a Germany powerful enough to undermine or\r\noverthrow them by intrigue or force?\r\n\r\nAny body of free men that compounds with the present German\r\nGovernment is compounding for its own destruction. But that is not\r\nthe whole of the story. Any man in America or anywhere else who\r\nsupposes that the free industry and enterprise of the world can\r\ncontinue if the Pan-German plan is achieved and German power fastened\r\nupon the world is as fatuous as the dreamers of Russia.\r\n\r\nWhat I am opposed to is not the feeling of the pacifists, but their\r\nstupidity. My heart is with them, but my mind has a contempt for\r\nthem. I want peace, but I know how to get it, and they do not.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that I sent a friend of mine, Colonel House, to\r\nEurope, who is as great a lover of peace as any man in the world; but\r\nI did not send him on a peace mission. I sent him to take part in a\r\nconference as to how the war was to be won. And he knows, as I know,\r\nthat that is the way to get peace if you want it for more than a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nIf we are true friends of freedom--our own or anybody else's--we will\r\nsee that the power of this country and the productivity of this\r\ncountry is raised to its absolute maximum and that absolutely nobody\r\nis allowed to stand in the way of it.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that nobody ought to be allowed to stand in the way, I\r\ndon't mean that they shall be prevented by the power of Government,\r\nbut by the power of the American spirit. Our duty, if we are to do\r\nthis great thing and show America to be what we believe her to be,\r\nthe greatest hope and energy in the world, then we must stand\r\ntogether night and day until the job is finished.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOR MUST BE FREE\r\n\r\nWhile we are fighting for freedom we must see, among other things,\r\nthat labor is free, and that means a number of interesting things. It\r\nmeans not only that we must do what we have declared our purpose to\r\ndo--see that the conditions of labor are not rendered more onerous by\r\nthe war--but also that we shall see to it that the instrumentalities\r\nby which the conditions of labor are improved are not blocked or\r\nchecked. That we must do. That has been the matter about which I have\r\ntaken pleasure in conferring, from time to time, with your president,\r\nMr. Gompers; and if I may be permitted to do so, I want to express my\r\nadmiration of his patriotic courage, his large vision, his\r\nstatesman-like sense and a mind that knows how to pull in harness.\r\nThe horses that kick over the traces will have to be put in a corral.\r\n\r\nNow, to \"stand together\" means that nobody must interrupt the\r\nprocesses of our energy if the interruption can possibly be avoided\r\nwithout the absolute invasion of freedom. To put it concretely, that\r\nmeans this: Nobody has a right to stop the processes of labor until\r\nall the methods of conciliation and settlement have been exhausted,\r\nand I might as well say right here that I am not talking to you\r\nalone. You sometimes stop the courses of labor, but there are others\r\nwho do the same. I am speaking of my own experience when I say that\r\nyou are reasonable in a larger number of cases than the capitalists.\r\n\r\nI am not saying these things to them personally yet, because I\r\nhaven't had a chance. But they have to be said, not in any spirit of\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nBut, in order to clear the atmosphere and come down to business,\r\neverybody on both sides has got to transact business, and the\r\nsettlement is never impossible when both sides want to do the square\r\nand right thing. Moreover, a settlement is always hard to avoid when\r\nthe parties can be brought face to face. I can differ with a man much\r\nmore radically when he isn't in the room than I can when he is in the\r\nroom, because then the awkward thing is that he can come back at me\r\nand answer what I say. It is always dangerous for a man to have the\r\nfloor entirely to himself. And, therefore, we must insist in every\r\ninstance that the parties come into each other's presence and there\r\ndiscuss the issues between them, and not separately in places which\r\nhave no communication with each other.\r\n\r\nI like to remind myself of a delightful saying of an Englishman of a\r\npast generation, Charles Lamb. He was with a group of friends and he\r\nspoke harshly of some man who was not present. I ought to say that\r\nLamb stuttered a little bit. And one of his friends said, \"Why,\r\nCharles, I didn't know that you knew So-and-so?\" \"Oh,\" he said, \"I\r\ndon't. I can't hate a man I know.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of human nature, of very pleasant human nature,\r\nin that saying. It is hard to hate a man you know. I may admit,\r\nparenthetically, that there are some politicians whose methods I do\r\nnot at all believe in, but they are jolly good fellows, and if they\r\nwould not talk the wrong kind of politics with me I would love to be\r\nwith them. And so it is all along the line, in serious matters and\r\nthings less serious. We are all of the same clay and spirit, and we\r\ncan get together if we desire to get together.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICANS MUST CO-OPERATE\r\n\r\nTherefore my counsel to you is this: Let us show ourselves Americans\r\nby showing that we do not want to go off in separate camps or groups\r\nby ourselves, but that we want to co-operate with all other classes\r\nand all other groups in a common enterprise, which is to release the\r\nspirits of the world from bondage. I would be willing to set that up\r\nas the final test of an American. That is the meaning of democracy.\r\n\r\nI have been very much distressed, my fellow-citizens, by some of the\r\nthings that have happened recently. The mob spirit is displaying\r\nitself here and there in this country. I have no sympathy with what\r\nsome men are saying, but I have no sympathy with the men that take\r\ntheir punishment into their own hands; and I want to say to every man\r\nwho does join such a mob that I recognize him as unworthy of the free\r\ninstitutions of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere are some organizations in this country whose object is anarchy\r\nand the destruction of the law. I despise and hate their purpose as\r\nmuch as any man, but I respect the ancient processes of justice, and\r\nI would be too proud not to see them done justice, however wrong they\r\nare. And so I want to utter my earnest protest against any\r\nmanifestation of the spirit of lawlessness anywhere or in any cause.\r\nWhy, gentlemen, look what it means.\r\n\r\nWe claim to be the greatest democratic people in the world, and\r\ndemocracy means, first of all, that we can govern ourselves. If our\r\nmen have not self-control, then they are not capable of that great\r\nthing which we call democratic government. A man who takes the law\r\ninto his own hands is not the right man to co-operate in any form of\r\norderly development of law and institutions.\r\n\r\nAnd some of the processes by which the struggle between capital and\r\nlabor is carried on are processes that come very near to taking the\r\nlaw into your own hands. I do not mean for a moment to compare them\r\nwith what I have just been speaking of, but I want you to see that\r\nthey are mere gradations of the manifestations of the unwillingness\r\nto co-operate. The fundamental lesson of the whole situation is that\r\nwe must not only take common counsel, but that we must yield to and\r\nobey common counsel. Not all of the instrumentalities for this are at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\nBETTER CONDITIONS MAY BE AT HAND\r\n\r\nI am hopeful that in the very near future new instrumentalities may\r\nbe organized by which we can see to it that various things that are\r\nnow going on shall not go on. There are various processes of the\r\ndilution of labor and the unnecessary substitution of labor and\r\nbidding in different markets and unfairly upsetting the whole\r\ncompetition of labor which ought not to go on--I mean now, on the\r\npart of employers--and we must interject into this some\r\ninstrumentality of co-operation by which the fair thing will be done\r\nall around.\r\n\r\nI am hopeful that some such instrumentalities may be devised, but\r\nwhether they are or not we must use those that we have, and upon\r\nevery occasion where it is necessary to have such an instrumentality,\r\noriginated upon that occasion, if necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd so, my fellow-citizens, the reason that I came away from\r\nWashington is that I sometimes get lonely down there--there are so\r\nmany people in Washington who know things that are not so, and there\r\nare so few people in Washington who know anything about what the\r\npeople of the United States are thinking about. I have to come away\r\nto get reminded of the rest of the country. I have come away and talk\r\nto men who are up against the real thing and say to them, I am with\r\nyou if you are with me. The only test of being with me is not to\r\nthink about me personally at all, but merely to think of me as the\r\nexpression for the time being of the power and dignity and hope of\r\nthe American people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO CONGRESS (_December 4, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Congress,--Eight months have elapsed since\r\nI last had the honor of addressing you. They have been months crowded\r\nwith events of immense and grave significance for us. I shall not\r\nundertake to detail or even to summarize these events. The practical\r\nparticulars of the part we have played in them will be laid before\r\nyou in the reports of the executive departments. I shall discuss only\r\nour present outlook upon these vast affairs, our present duties and\r\nthe immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always\r\nin view.\r\n\r\nI shall not go back to debate the causes of the war. The intolerable\r\nwrongs done and planned against us by the sinister masters of Germany\r\nhave long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true\r\nAmerican to need to be rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider\r\nagain, and with very grave scrutiny, our objectives and the measures\r\nby which we mean to attain them; for the purpose of discussion here\r\nin this place is action, and our action must move straight toward\r\ndefinite ends. Our object is, of course, to win the war, and we shall\r\nnot slacken or suffer ourselves to be diverted until it is won. But\r\nit is worth while asking and answering the question, When shall we\r\nconsider the war won?\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view it is not necessary to broach this fundamental\r\nmatter. I do not doubt that the American people know what the war is\r\nabout, and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization\r\nof their purpose in it. As a nation we are united in spirit and\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nI pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices\r\nof dissent--who does not? I hear the criticism and the clamor of the\r\nnoisily thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men here and there\r\nfling themselves in impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable\r\npower of the Nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neither\r\nits nature nor the way in which we may attain it, with uplifted eyes\r\nand unbroken spirits. But I know that none of these speaks for the\r\nNation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be\r\nleft to strut about their uneasy hour and be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR\r\n\r\nBut from another point of view I believe that it is necessary to say\r\nplainly what we here at the seat of action consider the war to be\r\nfor, and what part we mean to play in the settlement of its searching\r\nissues. We are the spokesmen of the American people, and they have a\r\nright to know whether their purpose is ours. They desire peace by the\r\novercoming of evil, but the defeat once and for all of the sinister\r\nforces that interrupt peace and render it impossible, and they wish\r\nto know how closely our thought runs with theirs and what action we\r\npropose. They are impatient with those who desire peace by any sort\r\nof compromise--deeply and indignantly impatient--but they will be\r\nequally impatient with us if we do not make it plain to them what our\r\nobjectives are and what we are planning for in seeking to make\r\nconquest of peace by arms.\r\n\r\nI believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that\r\nthis intolerable Thing of which the masters of Germany have shown us\r\nthe ugly face, this menace of combined intrigue and force, which we\r\nnow see so clearly as the German power, a Thing without conscience or\r\nhonor or capacity for covenanted peace, must be crushed, and, if it\r\nbe not utterly brought to an end, at least shut out from the friendly\r\nintercourse of the nations; and, second, that when this Thing and its\r\npower are indeed defeated and the time comes that we can discuss\r\npeace--when the German people have spokesmen whose word we can\r\nbelieve, and when those spokesmen are ready, in the name of their\r\npeople, to accept the common judgment of the nations as to what shall\r\nhenceforth be the bases of law and of covenant for the life of the\r\nworld--we shall be willing and glad to pay the full price for peace\r\nand pay it ungrudgingly. We know what that price will be. It will be\r\nfull, impartial justice--justice done at every point and to every\r\nnation that the final settlement must affect, our enemies as well as\r\nour friends.\r\n\r\nYou catch with me the voices of humanity that are in the air. They\r\ngrow daily more audible, more articulate, more persuasive, and they\r\ncome from the hearts of men everywhere. They insist that the war\r\nshall not end in vindictive action of any kind; that no nation or\r\npeople shall be robbed or punished because the irresponsible rulers\r\nof a single country have themselves done deep and abominable wrong.\r\nIt is this thought that has been expressed in the formula, \"No\r\nannexations, no contributions, no punitive indemnities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA LED ASTRAY\r\n\r\nJust because this crude formula expresses the instinctive judgment as\r\nto the right of plain men everywhere, it has been made diligent use\r\nof by the masters of German intrigue to lead the people of Russia\r\nastray, and the people of every other country their agents could\r\nreach, in order that a premature peace might be brought about before\r\nautocracy has been taught its final and convincing lesson and the\r\npeople of the world put in control of their own destinies.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that a wrong use has been made of a just idea is no\r\nreason why a right use should not be made of it. It ought to be\r\nbrought under the patronage of its real friends. Let it be said again\r\nthat autocracy must first be shown the utter futility of its claims\r\nto power or leadership in the modern world. It is impossible to apply\r\nany standard of justice so long as such forces are unchecked and\r\nundefeated as the present masters of Germany command. Not until that\r\nhas been done can right be set up as arbiter and peacemaker among the\r\nnations. But when that has been done--as, God willing, it assuredly\r\nwill be--we shall at last be free to do an unprecedented thing, and\r\nthis is the time to avow our purpose to do it. We shall be free to\r\nbase peace on generosity and justice, to the exclusion of all selfish\r\nclaims to advantage, even on the part of the victors.\r\n\r\nLet there be no misunderstanding. Our present and immediate task is\r\nto win the war, and nothing shall turn us aside from it until it is\r\naccomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of\r\nmoney, or of materials, is being devoted, and will continue to be\r\ndevoted, to that purpose until it is achieved. Those who desire to\r\nbring peace about before that purpose is achieved I counsel to carry\r\ntheir advice elsewhere. We will not entertain it.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE AND REPARATION\r\n\r\nWe shall regard the war only as won when the German people say to us,\r\nthrough properly accredited representatives, that they are ready to\r\nagree to a settlement based upon justice and the reparation of the\r\nwrongs their rulers have done. They have done a wrong to Belgium\r\nwhich must be repaired. They have established a power over other\r\nlands and peoples than their own--over the great empire of\r\nAustria-Hungary, over hitherto free Balkan states, over Turkey, and\r\nwithin Asia--which must be relinquished.\r\n\r\nGermany's success by skill, by industry, by knowledge, by enterprise,\r\nwe did not grudge or oppose, but admired rather. She had built up for\r\nherself a real empire of trade and influence, secured by the peace of\r\nthe world. We were content to abide the rivalries of manufacture,\r\nscience and commerce that were involved for us in her success, and\r\nstand or fall as we had or did not have the brains and the initiative\r\nto surpass her. But at the moment when she had conspicuously won her\r\ntriumphs of peace she threw them away to establish in their stead\r\nwhat the world will no longer permit to be established--military and\r\npolitical domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not\r\nexcel the rivals she most feared and hated.\r\n\r\nThe peace we make must remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once\r\nfair lands and happy peoples of Belgium and northern France from the\r\nPrussian conquest and the Prussian menace, but it must also deliver\r\nthe peoples of Austria-Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans, and the\r\npeoples of Turkey, alike in Europe and in Asia, from the impudent and\r\nalien domination of the Prussian military and commercial autocracy.\r\n\r\nWe owe it, however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish in any\r\nway to impair or to rearrange the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is no\r\naffair of ours what they do with their own life, either industrially\r\nor politically. We do not purpose nor desire to dictate to them in\r\nany way. We only desire to see that their affairs are left in their\r\nown hands, in all matters, great or small. We shall hope to secure\r\nfor the peoples of the Balkan peninsula and for the people of the\r\nTurkish Empire the right and opportunity to make their own lives\r\nsafe, their own fortunes secure against oppression or injustice and\r\nfrom the dictation of foreign courts or parties, and our attitude and\r\npurpose with regard to Germany herself are of a like kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR ATTITUDE TOWARD GERMANY\r\n\r\nWe intend no wrong against the German Empire, no interference with\r\nher internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the other\r\nabsolutely unjustifiable, absolutely contrary to the principles we\r\nhave professed to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life\r\nas a nation.\r\n\r\nThe people of Germany are being told by the men whom they now permit\r\nto deceive them and to act as their masters that they are fighting\r\nfor very life and existence of their empire, a war of desperate\r\nself-defense against deliberate aggression. Nothing could be more\r\ngrossly or wantonly false, and we must seek, by the utmost openness\r\nand candor as to our real aims, to convince them of its falseness. We\r\nare, in fact, fighting for their emancipation from fear, along with\r\nour own, from the fear as well as from the fact of unjust attack by\r\nneighbors or rivals or schemers after world empire. No one is\r\nthreatening the existence or the independence or the peaceful\r\nenterprise of the German Empire.\r\n\r\nThe worst that can happen to the detriment of the German people is\r\nthis, that if they should still, after the war is over, continue to\r\nbe obliged to live under ambitious and intriguing masters interested\r\nto disturb the peace of the world, men or classes of men whom the\r\nother peoples of the world could not trust, it might be impossible to\r\nadmit them to the partnership of nations which must henceforth\r\nguarantee the world's peace. That partnership must be a partnership\r\nof peoples, not a mere partnership of governments.\r\n\r\nIt might be impossible, also, in such untoward circumstances, to\r\nadmit Germany to the free economic intercourse which must inevitably\r\nspring out of the other partnerships of a real peace. But there would\r\nbe no aggression in that; and such a situation, inevitable because of\r\ndistrust, would in the very nature of things sooner or later cure\r\nitself, by processes which would assuredly set in.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS OF THE CENTRAL POWERS\r\n\r\nThe wrongs, the very deep wrongs, committed in this war will have to\r\nbe righted. That of course. But they cannot and must not be righted\r\nby the commission of similar wrongs against Germany and her allies.\r\nThe world will not permit the commission of similar wrongs as a means\r\nof reparation and settlement. Statesmen must by this time have\r\nlearned that the opinion of the world is everywhere wide awake and\r\nfully comprehends the issues involved. No representative of any\r\nself-governed nation will dare disregard it by attempting any such\r\ncovenants of selfishness and compromise as were entered into at the\r\ncongress of Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe thought of the plain people here and everywhere throughout the\r\nworld, the people who enjoy no privilege and have very simple and\r\nunsophisticated standards of right and wrong, is the air all\r\ngovernments must henceforth breathe if they would live. It is in the\r\nfull disclosing light of that thought that all policies must be\r\nconceived and executed in this midday hour of the world's life.\r\n\r\nGerman rulers have been able to upset the peace of the world only\r\nbecause the German people were not suffered, under their tutelage, to\r\nshare the comradeship of the other peoples of the world either in\r\nthought or in purpose. They were allowed to have no opinion of their\r\nown which might be set up as a rule of conduct for those who\r\nexercised authority over them. But the congress that concludes this\r\nwar will feel the full strength of the tides that run now in the\r\nhearts and consciences of free men everywhere. Its conclusions will\r\nrun with those tides.\r\n\r\nAll these things have been true from the very beginning of this\r\nstupendous war; and I cannot help thinking that if they had been made\r\nplain at the very outset the sympathy and enthusiasm of the Russian\r\npeople might have been once for all enlisted on the side of the\r\nAllies, suspicion and distrust swept away, and a real and lasting\r\nunion of purpose effected. Had they believed these things at the very\r\nmoment of their revolution, and had they been confirmed in that\r\nbelief since, the sad reverses which have recently marked the\r\nprogress of their affairs toward an ordered and stable government of\r\nfree men might have been avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUTH AS THE ANTIDOTE\r\n\r\nThe Russian people have been poisoned by the very same falsehoods\r\nthat have kept the German people in the dark, and the poison has been\r\nadministered by the very same hands. The only possible antidote is\r\nthe truth. It cannot be uttered too plainly or too often.\r\n\r\nFrom every point of view, therefore, it has seemed to be my duty to\r\nspeak these declarations of purpose, to add these specific\r\ninterpretations to what I took the liberty of saying to the Senate in\r\nJanuary. Our entrance into the war has not altered our attitude\r\ntoward the settlement that must come when it is over. When I said in\r\nJanuary that the nations of the world were entitled not only to free\r\npathways upon the sea, but also to assured and unmolested access to\r\nthose pathways, I was thinking, and I am thinking now, not of the\r\nsmaller and weaker nations alone, which need our countenance and\r\nsupport, but also of the great and powerful nations, and of our\r\npresent enemies as well as our present associates in the war. I was\r\nthinking, and am thinking now, of Austria herself, among the rest, as\r\nwell as of Serbia and of Poland. Justice and equality of rights can\r\nbe had only at a great price. We are seeking permanent, not\r\ntemporary, foundations for the peace of the world, and must seek them\r\ncandidly and fearlessly. As always, the right will prove to be the\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice\r\nto its righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand\r\nall impediments to success, and we must make every adjustment of law\r\nthat will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and\r\nforce as a fighting unit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR AGAINST AUSTRIA\r\n\r\nOne very embarrassing obstacle that stands in our way is that we are\r\nat war with Germany, but not with her allies. I therefore very\r\nearnestly recommend that the Congress immediately declare the United\r\nStates in a state of war with Austria-Hungary. Does it seem strange\r\nto you that this should be the conclusion of the argument I have just\r\naddressed to you? It is not. It is, in fact, the inevitable logic of\r\nwhat I have said. Austria-Hungary is for the time being not her own\r\nmistress, but simply the vassal of the German Government. We must\r\nface the facts as they are and act upon them without sentiment in\r\nthis stern business.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Austria-Hungary is not acting upon its own\r\ninitiative or in response to the wishes and feelings of its own\r\npeoples, but as the instrument of another nation. We must meet its\r\nforce with our own and regard the Central Powers as but one. The war\r\ncan be successfully conducted in no other way. The same logic would\r\nlead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They\r\nalso are the tools of Germany. But they are mere tools, and do not\r\nyet stand in the direct path of our necessary action. We shall go\r\nwherever the necessities of this war carry us, but it seems to me\r\nthat we should go only where immediate and practical considerations\r\nlead us, and not heed any others.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STRICTER GRIP ON ENEMY ALIENS\r\n\r\nThe financial and military measures which must be adopted will\r\nsuggest themselves as the war and its undertakings develop, but I\r\nwill take the liberty of proposing to you certain other acts of\r\nlegislation which seem to me to be needed for the support of the war\r\nand for the release of our whole force and energy.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to extend in certain particulars the legislation\r\nof the last session with regard to alien enemies; and also necessary,\r\nI believe, to create a very definite and particular control over the\r\nentrance and departure of all persons into and from the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nLegislation should be enacted defining as a criminal offense every\r\nwilful violation of the Presidential proclamations relating to enemy\r\naliens promulgated under Section 4067 of the Revised Statutes and\r\nproviding appropriate punishment; and women as well as men should be\r\nincluded under the terms of the acts placing restraints upon alien\r\nenemies. It is likely that as time goes on many alien enemies will be\r\nwilling to be fed and housed at the expense of the Government in the\r\ndetention camps, and it would be the purpose of the legislation I\r\nhave suggested to confine offenders among them in penitentiaries and\r\nother similar institutions, where they could be made to work as other\r\ncriminals do.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FURTHER LIMITING OF PRICES\r\n\r\nRecent experience has convinced me that the Congress must go further\r\nin authorizing the Government to set limits to prices. The law of\r\nsupply and demand, I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the law of\r\nunrestrained selfishness. While we have eliminated profiteering in\r\nseveral branches of industry, it still runs impudently rampant in\r\nothers. The farmers, for example, complain with a great deal of\r\njustice that, while the regulation of food prices restricts their\r\nincomes, no restraints are placed upon the prices of most of the\r\nthings they must themselves purchase; and similar inequities obtain\r\non all sides.\r\n\r\nIt is imperatively necessary that the consideration of the full use\r\nof the water power of the country, and also the consideration of the\r\nsystematic and yet economical development of such of the natural\r\nresources of the country as are still under the control of the\r\nFederal Government, should be resumed and affirmatively and\r\nconstructively dealt with at the earliest possible moment. The\r\npressing need of such legislation is daily becoming more obvious.\r\n\r\nThe legislation proposed at the last session with regard to regulated\r\ncombinations among our exporters, in order to provide for our foreign\r\ntrade a more effective organization and method of co-operation, ought\r\nby all means to be completed at this session.\r\n\r\nAnd I beg that the members of the House of Representatives will\r\npermit me to express the opinion that it will be impossible to deal\r\nin any way but a very wasteful and extravagant fashion with the\r\nenormous appropriations of the public moneys which must continue to\r\nbe made, if the war is to be properly sustained, unless the House\r\nwill consent to return to its former practice of initiating and\r\npreparing all appropriation bills through a single committee, in\r\norder that responsibility may be centered, expenditures standardized\r\nand made uniform, and waste and duplication as much as possible\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nAdditional legislation may also become necessary before the present\r\nCongress adjourns, in order to effect the most efficient\r\nco-ordination and operation of the railway and other transportation\r\nsystems of the country; but to that I shall, if circumstances should\r\ndemand, call the attention of Congress upon another occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINNING OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nIf I have overlooked anything that ought to be done for the more\r\neffective conduct of the war, your own counsels will supply the\r\nomission. What I am perfectly clear about is that, in the present\r\nsession of the Congress, our whole attention and energy should be\r\nconcentrated on the vigorous and rapid and successful prosecution of\r\nthe great task of winning the war.\r\n\r\nWe can do this with all the greater zeal and enthusiasm because we\r\nknow that for us this is a war of high principle, debased by no\r\nselfish ambition of conquest or spoliation; because we know, and all\r\nthe world knows, that we have been forced into it to save the very\r\ninstitutions we live under from corruption and destruction. The\r\npurposes of the Central Powers strike straight at the very heart of\r\neverything we believe in; their methods of warfare outrage every\r\nprinciple of humanity and of knightly honor; their intrigue has\r\ncorrupted the very thought and spirit of many of our people; their\r\nsinister and secret diplomacy has sought to take our very territory\r\naway from us and disrupt the union of the States. Our safety would be\r\nat an end, our honor forever sullied and brought into contempt, were\r\nwe to permit their triumph. They are striking at the very existence\r\nof democracy and liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is because it is for us a war of high, disinterested purpose, in\r\nwhich all the free people of the world are banded together for the\r\nvindication of right, a war for the preservation of our nation and of\r\nall that it has held dear of principle and of purpose, that we feel\r\nourselves doubly constrained to propose for its outcome only that\r\nwhich is righteous and of irreproachable intention, for our foes as\r\nwell as for our friends.\r\n\r\nThe cause being just and holy, the settlement must be of like motive\r\nand quality. For this we can fight, but for nothing less noble or\r\nless worthy of our traditions. For this cause we entered the war, and\r\nfor this cause we will battle until the last gun is fired.\r\n\r\nI have spoken plainly because this seems to me the time when it is\r\nmost necessary to speak plainly, in order that all the world may know\r\nthat even in the heat and ardor of the struggle, and when our whole\r\nthought is of carrying the war through to its end, we have not\r\nforgotten any ideal or principle for which the name of America has\r\nbeen held in honor among the nations and for which it has been our\r\nglory to contend in the great generations that went before us.\r\n\r\nA supreme moment of history has come. The eyes of the people have\r\nbeen opened and they see. The hand of God is laid upon the nations.\r\nHe will show them favor, I devoutly believe, only if they rise to the\r\nclear heights of His own justice and mercy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF WAR AGAINST AUSTRIA-HUNGARY\r\n\r\n(_December 12, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's proclamation, after citing the resolution of Congress\r\nauthorizing the war with Austria, says:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby proclaim to all whom it may concern that a state\r\nof war exists between the United States and the Imperial and Royal\r\nAustro-Hungarian Government, and I do specially direct all officers,\r\ncivil or military, of the United States that they exercise vigilance\r\nand zeal in the discharge of the duties incident to such a state of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAnd I do, moreover, earnestly appeal to all American citizens that\r\nthey, in loyal devotion to their country, dedicated from its\r\nfoundation to the principles of liberty and justice, uphold the laws\r\nof the land and give undivided and willing support to those measures\r\nwhich may be adopted by the constitutional authorities in prosecuting\r\nthe war to a successful issue and obtaining a secure and just peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEED ONLY OBEY THE LAWS\r\n\r\nAnd, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and the aforesaid sections of the\r\nRevised Statutes, I do hereby further proclaim and direct that the\r\nconduct to be observed on the part of the United States toward all\r\nnatives, citizens, denizens or subjects of Austria-Hungary, being\r\nmales of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within\r\nthe United States and not actually naturalized, shall be as follows:\r\n\r\n    All natives, citizens, denizens or subjects of\r\n    Austria-Hungary, being males of fourteen years and upward\r\n    who shall be within the United States and not actually\r\n    naturalized, are enjoined to preserve the peace toward the\r\n    United States and to refrain from crime against the public\r\n    safety and from violating the laws of the United States\r\n    and of the States and Territories thereof.\r\n\r\n    And to refrain from actual hostility or giving\r\n    information, aid or comfort to the enemies of the United\r\n    States.\r\n\r\n    And to comply strictly with the regulations which are\r\n    hereby or which may be, from time to time, promulgated by\r\n    the President.\r\n\r\n    And so long as they shall conduct themselves in accordance\r\n    with law, they shall be undisturbed in the peaceful\r\n    pursuit of their lives and occupations and be accorded the\r\n    consideration due to all peaceful and law-abiding persons,\r\n    except so far as restrictions may be necessary for their\r\n    own protection and for the safety of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FRIENDLY ATTITUDE IS URGED\r\n\r\nAnd toward such of said persons as conduct themselves in accordance\r\nwith law, all citizens of the United States are enjoined to preserve\r\nthe peace and to treat them with all such friendliness as may be\r\ncompatible with loyalty and allegiance to the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd all natives, citizens, denizens or subjects of Austria-Hungary,\r\nbeing males of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be\r\nwithin the United States and not actually naturalized, who fail to\r\nconduct themselves as so enjoined, in addition to all other penalties\r\nprescribed by law, shall be liable to restraint or to give security,\r\nor to remove and depart from the United States in the manner\r\nprescribed by Sections 4069 and 4070 of the Revised Statutes and as\r\nprescribed in regulations duly promulgated by the President:\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW REGULATIONS\r\n\r\nAnd pursuant to the authority vested in me, I hereby declare and\r\nestablish the following regulations, which I find necessary in the\r\npremises, and for the public safety:\r\n\r\n    1. No native, citizen, denizen or subject of\r\n    Austria-Hungary, being a male of the age of fourteen years\r\n    and upward and not actually naturalized, shall depart from\r\n    the United States until he shall have received such permit\r\n    as the President shall prescribe, or except under order of\r\n    a court, judge or justice, under Sections 4069 and 4070 of\r\n    the Revised Statutes.\r\n\r\n    2. No such person shall land or enter the United States\r\n    except under such restrictions and at such places as the\r\n    President may prescribe.\r\n\r\n    3. Every such person, of whom there may be reasonable\r\n    cause to believe that he is aiding or about to aid the\r\n    enemy, or who may be at large to the danger of the public\r\n    peace or safety, or who violates or attempts to violate,\r\n    or of whom there is reasonable ground to believe that he\r\n    is about to violate any regulation duly promulgated by the\r\n    President, or any criminal law of the United States, or of\r\n    the States or Territories thereof, will be subject to\r\n    summary arrest by the United States Marshal or his deputy,\r\n    or such other officers as the President shall designate,\r\n    and to confinement in such penitentiary, prison, jail,\r\n    military camp or other place of detention as may be\r\n    directed by the President.\r\n\r\nThis proclamation and the regulations herein contained shall extend\r\nand apply to all land and water, continental or insular, in any way\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT TAKES OVER THE RAILROADS\r\n\r\n(_A Statement by the President, December 26, 1917_)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have exercised the powers over the transportation systems of the\r\ncountry which were granted me by the Act of Congress of August, 1916,\r\nbecause it has become imperatively necessary for me to do so.\r\n\r\nThis is a war of resources no less than of men, perhaps even more\r\nthan of men, and it is necessary for the complete mobilization of our\r\nresources that the transportation systems of the country should be\r\norganized and employed under a single authority and a simplified\r\nmethod of co-ordination which have not proved possible under private\r\nmanagement and control.\r\n\r\nThe committee of railway executives who have been co-operating with\r\nthe Government in this all-important matter have done the utmost that\r\nit was possible for them to do; have done it with patriotic zeal and\r\nwith great ability; but there were differences that they could\r\nneither escape nor neutralize.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN FAIRNESS TO THE RAILROADS\r\n\r\nComplete unity of administration in the present circumstances\r\ninvolves upon occasion and at many points a serious dislocation of\r\nearnings, and the committee was, of course, without power or\r\nauthority to rearrange changes or effect proper compensations and\r\nadjustments of earnings. Several roads which were willingly and with\r\nadmirable public spirit accepting the orders of the committee have\r\nalready suffered from these circumstances and should not be required\r\nto suffer further. In mere fairness to them the full authority of the\r\nGovernment must be substituted.\r\n\r\nThe Government itself will thereby gain an immense increase of\r\nefficiency in the conduct of the war and of the innumerable\r\nactivities upon which its successful conduct depends.\r\n\r\nThe public interest must be first served, and in addition the\r\nfinancial interests of the Government and the financial interests of\r\nthe railways must be brought under a common direction. The financial\r\noperations of the railways need not then interfere with the\r\nborrowings of the Government, and they themselves can be conducted at\r\na great advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTORS TO BE PROTECTED\r\n\r\nInvestors in railway securities may rest assured that their rights\r\nand interests will be as scrupulously looked after by the Government\r\nas they could be by the directors of the several railway systems.\r\nImmediately upon the reassembling of Congress I shall recommend that\r\nthese definite guarantees be given:\r\n\r\nFirst, of course, that the railway properties will be maintained\r\nduring the period of Federal control in as good repair and as\r\ncomplete equipment as when taken over by the Government, and, second,\r\nthat the roads shall receive a net operating income equal in each\r\ncase to the average net income of the three years preceding June 30,\r\n1917; and I am entirely confident that the Congress will be disposed\r\nin this case, as in others, to see that justice is done and full\r\nsecurity assured to the owners and creditors of the great systems\r\nwhich the Government must now use under its own direction or else\r\nsuffer serious embarrassment.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War and I are agreed that, all the circumstances\r\nbeing taken into consideration, the best results can be obtained\r\nunder the immediate executive direction of the Hon. William G.\r\nMcAdoo, whose practical experience peculiarly fits him for the\r\nservice, and whose authority as Secretary of the Treasury will enable\r\nhim to co-ordinate, as no other man could, the many financial\r\ninterests which will be involved and which might, unless\r\nsystematically directed, suffer very embarrassing entanglements.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RECOGNITION OF FACTS\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is the only great Government now\r\nengaged in the war which has not already assumed control of this\r\nsort. It was thought to be in the spirit of American institutions to\r\nattempt to do everything that was necessary through private\r\nmanagement, and if zeal and ability and patriotic motive could have\r\naccomplished the necessary unification of administration, it would\r\ncertainly have been accomplished; but no zeal or ability could\r\novercome insuperable obstacles and I have deemed it my duty to\r\nrecognize that fact in all candor, now that it is demonstrated, and\r\nto use without reserve the great authority reposed in me.\r\n\r\nA great national necessity dictated the action, and I was therefore\r\nnot at liberty to abstain from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe text of the proclamation follows:\r\n\r\nWhereas, the Congress of the United States, in the exercise of the\r\nconstitutional authority vested in them, by joint resolution of the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives, bearing date April 6, 1917,\r\nresolved:\r\n\r\n    \"That the state of war between the United States and the\r\n    Imperial German Government which has thus been thrust upon\r\n    the United States is hereby formally declared, and that\r\n    the President be, and he is hereby, authorized and\r\n    directed to employ the entire naval and military forces of\r\n    the United States and the resources of the Government to\r\n    carry on war against the Imperial German Government, and\r\n    to bring the conflict to a successful termination, all of\r\n    the resources of the country are hereby pledged by the\r\n    Congress of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by joint resolution bearing date of December 7, 1917, resolved:\r\n\r\n    \"That a state of war is hereby declared to exist between\r\n    the United States of America and the Imperial and Royal\r\n    Austro-Hungarian Government, and that the President be,\r\n    and he is hereby, authorized and directed to employ the\r\n    entire naval and military forces of the United States and\r\n    the resources of the Government to carry on war against\r\n    the Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Government, and to\r\n    bring the conflict to a successful termination, all the\r\n    resources of the country are hereby pledged by the\r\n    Congress of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, it is provided by Section 1 of the act approved August\r\n29, 1916, entitled \"An act making appropriations for the support of\r\nthe army for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1917, and for other\r\npurposes,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"The President, in time of war, is empowered, through the\r\n    Secretary of War, to take possession and assume control of\r\n    any system or systems of transportation, or any part\r\n    thereof, and to utilize the same, to the exclusion as far\r\n    as may be necessary of all other traffic thereon, for the\r\n    transfer or transportation of troops, war material and\r\n    equipment, or for such other purposes connected with the\r\n    emergency as may be needful or desirable.\"\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, it has now become necessary in the national defense to\r\ntake possession and assume control of certain systems of\r\ntransportation and to utilize the same, to the exclusion as far as\r\nmay be necessary of other than war traffic thereon for the\r\ntransportation of troops, war material and equipment therefor, and\r\nfor other needful and desirable purposes connected with the\r\nprosecution of the war.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States,\r\nunder and by virtue of the powers vested in me by the foregoing\r\nresolutions and statute, and by virtue of all other powers thereto me\r\nenabling, do hereby, through Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War, take\r\npossession and assume control at 12 o'clock noon on the twenty-eighth\r\nday of December, 1917, of each and every system of transportation and\r\nthe appurtenances thereof located wholly or in part within the\r\nboundaries of the continental United States and consisting of\r\nrailroads, and owned or controlled systems of coastwise and inland\r\ntransportation, engaged in general transportation, whether operated\r\nby steam or by electric power, including also terminals, terminal\r\ncompanies and terminal associations, sleeping and parlor cars,\r\nprivate cars and private car lines, elevators, warehouses, telegraph\r\nand telephone lines and all other equipment and appurtenances\r\ncommonly used upon or operated as a part of such rail or combined\r\nrail and water systems of transportation, to the end that such\r\nsystems of transportation be utilized for the transfer and\r\ntransportation of troops, war material and equipment to the exclusion\r\nso far as may be necessary of all other traffic thereon, and that so\r\nfar as such exclusive use be not necessary or desirable, such systems\r\nof transportation be operated and utilized in the performance of such\r\nother services as the national interest may require and of the usual\r\nand ordinary business and duties of common carriers.\r\n\r\nIt is hereby directed that the possession, control, operation and\r\nutilization of such transportation systems hereby by me undertaken\r\nshall be exercised by and through William G. McAdoo, who is hereby\r\nappointed and designated Director-General of Railroads.\r\n\r\nSaid director may perform the duties imposed upon him, so long and to\r\nsuch extent as he shall determine, through the boards of directors,\r\nreceivers, officers and employees of said systems of transportation.\r\nUntil and except so far as said director shall from time to time by\r\ngeneral or special orders otherwise provide, the boards of directors,\r\nreceivers, officers and employees of the various transportation\r\nsystems shall continue the operation thereof in the usual and\r\nordinary course of the business of common carriers, in the names of\r\ntheir respective companies.\r\n\r\nUntil and except so far as said director shall from time to time\r\notherwise by general or special orders determine, such systems of\r\ntransportation shall remain subject to all existing statutes and\r\norders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and to all statutes and\r\norders of regulating commissions of the various States in which said\r\nsystems or any part thereof may be situated. But any orders, general\r\nor special, hereafter made by said director shall have paramount\r\nauthority and be obeyed as such.\r\n\r\nNothing herein shall be construed as now affecting the possession,\r\noperation and control of street electric passenger railways,\r\nincluding railways commonly called interurban, whether such railways\r\nbe or be not owned or controlled by such railroad companies or\r\nsystems. By subsequent order and proclamation, if and when it shall\r\nbe found necessary or desirable, possession, control or operation may\r\nbe taken of all or any part of such street railway systems, including\r\nsubways and tunnels, and by subsequent order and proclamation\r\npossession, control and operation in whole or in part may also be\r\nrelinquished to the owners thereof of any part of the railroad\r\nsystems or rail and water systems, possession and control of which\r\nare hereby assumed.\r\n\r\nThe director shall as soon as may be after having assumed such\r\npossession and control enter upon negotiations with the several\r\ncompanies looking to agreements for just and reasonable compensation\r\nfor the possession, use and control of the respective properties on\r\nthe basis of an annual guaranteed compensation, above accruing\r\ndepreciation and the maintenance of their properties, equivalent, as\r\nnearly as may be, to the average of the net operating income thereof\r\nfor the three year period ending June 30, 1917--the results of such\r\nnegotiations to be reported to me for such action as may be\r\nappropriate and lawful.\r\n\r\nBut nothing herein contained, expressed or implied, or hereafter done\r\nor suffered hereunder, shall be deemed in any way to impair the\r\nrights of the stockholders, bondholders, creditors and other persons\r\nhaving interests in said systems of transportation or in the profits\r\nthereof, to receive just and adequate compensation for the use and\r\ncontrol and operation of their property hereby assumed.\r\n\r\nRegular dividends hitherto declared, and maturing interest upon\r\nbonds, debentures and other obligations, may be paid in due course,\r\nand such regular dividends and interest may continue to be paid until\r\nand unless the said director shall from time to time otherwise by\r\ngeneral or special orders determine, and, subject to the approval of\r\nthe director, the various carriers may agree upon and arrange for the\r\nrenewal and extension of maturing obligations.\r\n\r\nExcept with the prior written assent of said director, no attachment\r\nby mesne process or on execution shall be levied on or against any of\r\nthe property used by any of said transportation systems, in the\r\nconduct of their business as common carriers; but suits may be\r\nbrought by and against said carriers and judgments rendered as\r\nhitherto until and except so far as said director may, by general or\r\nspecial orders, otherwise determine.\r\n\r\nFrom and after 12 o'clock on said twenty-eighth day of December,\r\n1917, all transportation systems included in this order and\r\nproclamation shall conclusively be deemed within the possession and\r\ncontrol of said director without further act or notice, but for the\r\npurpose of accounting said possession and control shall date from 12\r\no'clock midnight on December 31, 1917.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal\r\nof the United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone by the President, through Newton D.

BAKER, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n\r\nROBERT LANSING, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OPERATION OF RAILROADS\r\n\r\n(_Address to the Congress, January 4, 1918_)\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Congress,--I have asked the privilege of addressing\r\nyou in order to report that on the 28th of December last, during the\r\nrecess of Congress, acting through the Secretary of War, and under\r\nthe authority conferred upon me by the Act of Congress approved\r\nAugust 29, 1916, I took possession and assumed control of the railway\r\nlines of the country and the systems of water transportation under\r\ntheir control. This step seemed to be imperatively necessary in the\r\ninterest of the public welfare, in the presence of the great tasks of\r\nwar with which we are now dealing. As our experience develops\r\ndifficulties and makes it clear what they are, I have deemed it my\r\nduty to remove those difficulties wherever I have the legal power to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nTo assume control of the vast railway systems of the country is, I\r\nrealize, a very great responsibility, but to fail to do so in the\r\nexisting circumstances would have been much greater. I assumed the\r\nless responsibility rather than the weightier.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEED OF UNITED DIRECTION\r\n\r\nI am sure that I am speaking the mind of all thoughtful Americans\r\nwhen I say that it is our duty as the representatives of the nation\r\nto do everything that it is necessary to do to secure the complete\r\nmobilization of the whole resources of America by as rapid and\r\neffective a means as can be found. Transportation supplies all the\r\narteries of mobilization. Unless it be under a single and unified\r\ndirection, the whole process of the nation's action is embarrassed.\r\n\r\nIt was in the true spirit of America, and it was right, that we\r\nshould first try to effect the necessary unification under the\r\nvoluntary action of those who were in charge of the great railway\r\nproperties, and we did try it. The directors of the railways\r\nresponded to the need promptly and generously. The group of railway\r\nexecutives who were charged with the task of actual co-ordination and\r\ngeneral direction performed their difficult duties with patriotic\r\nzeal and marked ability, as was to have been expected, and did, I\r\nbelieve, everything that it was possible for them to do in the\r\ncircumstances. If I have taken the task out of their hands, it has\r\nnot been because of any dereliction or failure on their part, but\r\nonly because there were some things which the Government can do, and\r\nprivate management cannot. We shall continue to value most highly the\r\nadvice and assistance of these gentlemen, and I am sure we shall not\r\nfind them withholding it.\r\n\r\nIt had become unmistakably plain that only under Government\r\nadministration can the entire equipment of the several systems of\r\ntransportation be fully and unreservedly thrown into a common service\r\nwithout injurious discrimination against particular properties; only\r\nunder Government administration can absolutely unrestricted and\r\nunembarrassed common use be made of all tracks, terminal facilities\r\nand equipment of every kind. Only under that authority can new\r\nterminals be constructed and developed without regard to the\r\nrequirements or limitations of particular roads. But under Government\r\nadministration all these things will be possible--not instantly, but\r\nas fast as practical difficulties, which cannot be merely conjured\r\naway, give way before the new management.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS LITTLE DISTURBANCE AS POSSIBLE\r\n\r\nThe common administration will be carried out with as little\r\ndisturbance of the present operating organizations and personnel of\r\nthe railways as possible. Nothing will be altered or disturbed which\r\nis not necessary to disturb. We are serving the public interest and\r\nsafeguarding the public safety, but we are also regardful of the\r\ninterest of those by whom these great properties are owned and glad\r\nto avail ourselves of the experience and trained ability of those who\r\nhave been managing them. It is necessary that the transportation of\r\ntroops and of war materials, of food and of fuel, and of everything\r\nthat is necessary for the full mobilization of the energies and\r\nresources of the country, should be first considered; but it is\r\nclearly in the public interest also that the ordinary activities and\r\nthe normal industrial and commercial life of the country should be\r\ninterfered with and dislocated as little as possible, and the public\r\nmay rest assured that the interest and convenience of the private\r\nshipper will be carefully served and safeguarded as it is possible to\r\nserve and safeguard it in the present extraordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION SHOULD BE GUARANTEED\r\n\r\nWhile the present authority of the Executive suffices for all\r\npurposes of administration, and while, of course, all private\r\ninterests must for the present give way to the public necessity, it\r\nis, I am sure you will agree with me, right and necessary that the\r\nowners and creditors of the railways, the holders of their stocks and\r\nbonds, should receive from the Government an unqualified guarantee\r\nthat their properties will be maintained throughout the period of\r\nFederal control in as good repair and as complete equipment as at\r\npresent, and that the several roads will receive, under Federal\r\nmanagement, such compensation as is equitable and just alike to their\r\nowners and to the general public. I would suggest the average net\r\nrailway operating income of the three years ending June 30, 1917. I\r\nearnestly recommend that these guarantees be given by appropriate\r\nlegislation, and given as promptly as circumstances permit.\r\n\r\nI need not point out the essential justice of such guarantees and\r\ntheir great influence and significance as elements in the present\r\nfinancial and industrial situation of the country. Indeed, one of the\r\nstrong arguments for assuming control of the railroads at this time\r\nis the financial argument. It is necessary that the values of railway\r\nsecurities should be justly and fairly protected, and that the\r\nlargest financial operations every year necessary in connection with\r\nthe maintenance, operation and development of the roads should,\r\nduring the period of the war, be wisely related to the financial\r\noperations of the Government.\r\n\r\nOur first duty is, of course, to conserve the common interest and the\r\ncommon safety, and to make certain that nothing stands in the way of\r\nthe successful prosecution of the great war for liberty and justice;\r\nbut it is an obligation of public conscience and of public honor that\r\nthe private interests we disturb should be kept safe from unjust\r\ninjury, and it is of the utmost consequence to the Government itself\r\nthat all great financial operations should be stabilized and\r\nco-ordinated with the financial operations of the Government. No\r\nborrowing should run athwart the borrowings of the Federal Treasury,\r\nand no fundamental industrial values should anywhere be unnecessarily\r\nimpaired. In the hands of many thousands of small investors in the\r\ncountry, as well as in national banks, in insurance companies, in\r\nsavings banks, in trust companies, in financial agencies of every\r\nkind, railway securities--the sum total of which runs up to some ten\r\nor eleven thousand millions, constitute a vital part of the structure\r\nof credit, and the unquestioned solidity of that structure must be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF MCADOO AS DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War and I easily agreed that, in view of the many\r\ncomplex interests which must be safeguarded and harmonized, as well\r\nas because of his exceptional experience and ability in this new\r\nfield of governmental action, the Hon. William G. McAdoo was the\r\nright man to assume direct administrative control of this new\r\nexecutive task. At our request, he consented to assume the authority\r\nand duties of organizer and director-general of the new railway\r\nadministration. He has assumed those duties, and his work is in\r\nactive progress.\r\n\r\nIt is probably too much to expect that, even under the unified\r\nrailway administration which will now be possible, sufficient\r\neconomies can be effected in the operation of the railways to make it\r\npossible to add to their equipment and extend their operative\r\nfacilities as much as the present extraordinary demands upon their\r\nuse will render desirable, without resorting to the national Treasury\r\nfor the funds. If it is not possible, it will, of course, be\r\nnecessary to resort to the Congress for grants of money for that\r\npurpose. The Secretary of the Treasury will advise with your\r\ncommittees with regard to this very practical aspect of the matter.\r\nFor the present, I suggest only the guarantees I have indicated and\r\nsuch appropriations as are necessary at the outset of this task.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of expressing the hope that the Congress may grant\r\nthese promptly and ungrudgingly. We are dealing with great matters,\r\nand will, I am sure, deal with them greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nTHE TERMS OF PEACE\r\n\r\n(_January 8, 1918_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an address to both Houses of Congress, assembled in joint session,\r\nPresident Wilson enunciated the war and peace program of the United\r\nStates in fourteen definite proposals. The President spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Congress,--Once more, as repeatedly before, the\r\nspokesmen of the Central Empires have indicated their desires to\r\ndiscuss the objects of the war and the possible basis of a general\r\npeace. Parleys have been in progress at Brest-Litovsk between Russian\r\nrepresentatives and representatives of the Central Powers to which\r\nthe attention of all the belligerents has been invited for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining whether it may be possible to extend these\r\nparleys into a general conference with regard to terms of peace and\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe Russian representatives presented not only a perfectly definite\r\nstatement of the principles upon which they would be willing to\r\nconclude peace, but also an equally definite program of the concrete\r\napplication of those principles. The representatives of the Central\r\nPowers, on their part, presented an outline of settlement which, if\r\nmuch less definite, seemed susceptible of liberal interpretation\r\nuntil their specific program of practical terms was added. That\r\nprogram proposed no concessions at all, either to the sovereignty of\r\nRussia or to the preferences of the population with whose fortunes it\r\ndealt, but meant, in a word, that the Central Empires were to keep\r\nevery foot of territory their armed forces had occupied--every\r\nprovince, every city, every point of vantage--as a permanent addition\r\nto their territories and their power. It is a reasonable conjecture\r\nthat the general principles of settlement which they at first\r\nsuggested originated with the more liberal statesmen of Germany and\r\nAustria, the men who have begun to feel the force of their own\r\npeople's thought and purpose, while the concrete terms of actual\r\nsettlement came from the military leaders who have no thought but to\r\nkeep what they have got. The negotiations have been broken off. The\r\nRussian representatives were sincere and in earnest. They cannot\r\nentertain such proposals of conquest and domination.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE IN PARLEYS\r\n\r\nThe whole incident is full of significance. It is also full of\r\nperplexity. With whom are the Russian representatives dealing? For\r\nwhom are the representatives of the Central Empires speaking? Are\r\nthey speaking for the majorities of their respective parliaments, or\r\nfor the minority parties--that military and imperialistic minority\r\nwhich has so far dominated their whole policy and controlled the\r\naffairs of Turkey and the Balkan states, which have felt obliged to\r\nbecome their associates in this war? The Russian representatives have\r\ninsisted, very justly, very wisely, and in the true spirit of modern\r\ndemocracy, that the conferences they have been holding with the\r\nTeutonic and Turkish statesmen should be held within open, not\r\nclosed, doors, and all the world has been audience, as was desired.\r\n\r\nTo whom have we been listening, then? To those who speak the spirit\r\nand intention of the resolution of the German Reichstag of the 9th of\r\nJuly last, the spirit and intention of the Liberal leaders and\r\nparties of Germany, or to those who resist and defy that spirit and\r\nintention and insist upon conquest and subjugation? Or are we\r\nlistening, in fact, to both, unreconciled and in open and hopeless\r\ncontradiction? These are very serious and pregnant questions. Upon\r\nthe answer to them depends the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever the results of the parleys at Brest-Litovsk, whatever\r\nthe confusions of counsel and of purpose in the utterances of the\r\nspokesmen of the Central Empires, they have again attempted to\r\nacquaint the world with their objects in the war and have again\r\nchallenged their adversaries to say what their objects are and what\r\nsort of settlement they would deem just and satisfactory. There is no\r\ngood reason why that challenge should not be responded to and\r\nresponded to with the utmost candor. We did not wait for it. Not\r\nonce, but again and again, we have laid our whole thought and purpose\r\nbefore the world, not in general terms only, but each time with\r\nsufficient definition to make it clear what sort of definitive terms\r\nof settlement must necessarily spring out of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLLOYD GEORGE'S AIMS APPROVED\r\n\r\nWithin the last week Mr. Lloyd George has spoken with admirable\r\ncandor and in admirable spirit for the people and Government of Great\r\nBritain. There is no confusion of counsel among the adversaries of\r\nthe Central Powers, no uncertainty of principle, no vagueness of\r\ndetail. The only secrecy of counsel, the only lack of fearless\r\nfrankness, the only failure to make definite statement of the objects\r\nof the war lies with Germany and her allies. The issues of life and\r\ndeath hang upon these definitions. No statesman who has the least\r\nconception of his responsibility ought for a moment to permit himself\r\nto continue this tragical and appalling outpouring of blood and\r\ntreasure unless he is sure beyond a peradventure that the objects of\r\nthe vital sacrifice are part and parcel of the very life of society,\r\nand that the people for whom he speaks think them right and\r\nimperative, as he does.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, a voice calling for these definitions of\r\nprinciple and of purpose which is, it seems to me, more thrilling and\r\nmore compelling than any of the many moving voices with which the\r\ntroubled air of the world is filled. It is the voice of the Russian\r\npeople. They are prostrate and all but helpless, it would seem,\r\nbefore the grim power of Germany, which has hitherto known no\r\nrelenting and no pity. Their power apparently is shattered. And yet\r\ntheir soul is not subservient. They will not yield either in\r\nprinciple or in action. Their conception of what is right, of what it\r\nis humane and honorable for them to accept, has been stated with a\r\nfrankness, a largeness of view, a generosity of spirit and a\r\nuniversal human sympathy which must challenge the admiration of every\r\nfriend of mankind; and they have refused to compound their ideals or\r\ndesert others that they themselves may be safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOULD LIKE TO AID RUSSIA\r\n\r\nThey call to us to say what it is that we desire--in what, if in\r\nanything, our purpose and our spirit differ from theirs; and I\r\nbelieve that the people of the United States would wish me to respond\r\nwith utter simplicity and frankness. Whether their present leaders\r\nbelieve it or not, it is our heartfelt desire and hope that some way\r\nmay be opened whereby we may be privileged to assist the people of\r\nRussia to attain their utmost hope of liberty and ordered peace.\r\n\r\nIt will be our wish and purpose that the processes of peace, when\r\nthey are begun, shall be absolutely open, and that they shall involve\r\nand permit henceforth no secret understandings of any kind. The day\r\nof conquest and aggrandizement is gone by; so is also the day of\r\nsecret covenants entered into in the interest of particular\r\ngovernments and likely, at some unlooked-for moment, to upset the\r\npeace of the world. It is this happy fact, now clear to the view of\r\nevery public man whose thoughts do not still linger in an age that is\r\ndead and gone, which makes it possible for every nation whose\r\npurposes are consistent with justice and the peace of the world to\r\navow now, or at any other time, the objects it has in view.\r\n\r\nWe entered this war because violations of right had occurred which\r\ntouched us to the quick and made the life of our own people\r\nimpossible unless they were corrected and the world secured once for\r\nall against their recurrence. What we demand in this war, therefore,\r\nis nothing peculiar to ourselves. It is that the world be made fit\r\nand safe to live in; and particularly that it be made safe for every\r\npeace-loving nation which, like our own, wishes to live its own life,\r\ndetermine its own institutions, be assured of justice and fair\r\ndealing by the other peoples of the world as against force and\r\nselfish aggression. All the peoples of the world are in effect\r\npartners in this interest, and for our own part we see very clearly\r\nthat unless justice be done to others it will not be done to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFINITE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program, and that\r\nprogram, the only possible program, as we see it, is this:\r\n\r\nI. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there\r\nshall be no private international understandings of any kind, but\r\ndiplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view.\r\n\r\nII. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial\r\nwaters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed\r\nin whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of\r\ninternational covenants.\r\n\r\nIII. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and\r\nthe establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the\r\nnations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nIV. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will\r\nbe reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.\r\n\r\nV. A free, open-minded and absolutely impartial adjustment of all\r\ncolonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that\r\nin determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the\r\npopulations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable\r\nclaims of the Government whose title is to be determined.\r\n\r\nVI. The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of\r\nall questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest\r\nco-operation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her\r\nan unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent\r\ndetermination of her own political development and national policy\r\nand assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations\r\nunder institutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome,\r\nassistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself\r\ndesire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations will be\r\nthe acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs\r\nas distinguished from their own interests and of their intelligent\r\nand unselfish sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM MUST BE RESTORED\r\n\r\nVII. Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and\r\nrestored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she\r\nenjoys in common with all other free nations. No other single act\r\nwill serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nations\r\nin the laws which they have themselves set and determined for the\r\ngovernment of their relations with one another. Without this healing\r\nact the whole structure and validity of international law is forever\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nVIII. All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions\r\nrestored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the\r\nmatter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world\r\nfor nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may\r\nonce more be made secure in the interest of all.\r\n\r\nIX. A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along\r\nclearly recognizable lines of nationality.\r\n\r\nX. The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we\r\nwish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest\r\nopportunity of autonomous development.\r\n\r\nXI. Rumania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be evacuated; occupied\r\nterritories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the\r\nsea; and the relations of the several Balkan states to one another\r\ndetermined by friendly counsel along historically established lines\r\nof allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the\r\npolitical and economic independence and territorial integrity of the\r\nseveral Balkan states should be entered into.\r\n\r\nXII. The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be\r\nassured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are\r\nnow under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of\r\nlife and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous\r\ndevelopment, and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a\r\nfree passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under\r\ninternational guarantees.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE FOR POLAND\r\n\r\nXIII. An independent Polish state should be erected which should\r\ninclude the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations,\r\nwhich should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and\r\nwhose political and economic independence and territorial integrity\r\nshould be guaranteed by international covenant.\r\n\r\nXIV. A general association of nations must be formed under specific\r\ncovenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political\r\nindependence and territorial integrity to great and small states\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nIn regard to these essential rectifications of wrong and assertions\r\nof right, we feel ourselves to be intimate partners of all the\r\nGovernments and peoples associated together against the imperialists.\r\nWe cannot be separated in interest or divided in purpose. We stand\r\ntogether until the end.\r\n\r\nFor such arrangements and covenants we are willing to fight, and to\r\ncontinue to fight, until they are achieved; but only because we wish\r\nthe right to prevail and desire a just and stable peace, such as can\r\nbe secured only by removing the chief provocations to war, which this\r\nprogram does remove. We have no jealousy of German greatness, and\r\nthere is nothing in this program that impairs it. We grudge her no\r\nachievement or distinction of learning or of pacific enterprise, such\r\nas have made her record very bright and very enviable. We do not wish\r\nto injure her or to block in any way her legitimate influence or\r\npower. We do not wish to fight her either with arms or with hostile\r\narrangements of trade, if she is willing to associate herself with us\r\nand the other peace-loving nations of the world in covenants of\r\njustice and law and fair dealing. We wish her only to accept a place\r\nof equality among the peoples of the world--the new world in which we\r\nnow live--instead of a place of mastery.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY'S SPOKESMEN AN ISSUE\r\n\r\nNeither do we presume to suggest to her any alteration or\r\nmodification of her institutions. But it is necessary, we must\r\nfrankly say, and necessary as a preliminary to any intelligent\r\ndealings with her on our part, that we should know whom her spokesmen\r\nspeak for when they speak to us, whether for the Reichstag majority\r\nor for the military party and the men whose creed is imperial\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken now surely in terms too concrete to admit of any\r\nfurther doubt or question. An evident principle runs through the\r\nwhole program I have outlined. It is the principle of justice to all\r\npeoples and nationalities and their right to live on equal terms of\r\nliberty and safety with one another, whether they be strong or weak.\r\nUnless this principle be made its foundation, no part of the\r\nstructure of international justice can stand. The people of the\r\nUnited States could act upon no other principle, and to the\r\nvindication of this principle they are ready to devote their lives,\r\ntheir honor and everything that they possess. The moral climax of\r\nthis, the culminating and final war for human liberty, has come, and\r\nthey are ready to put their own strength, their own highest purpose,\r\ntheir own integrity and devotion to the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nSTATE DEPARTMENT'S REVISED LIST OF\r\nNATIONS AT WAR WHICH HAVE\r\nBROKEN RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATIONS OF WAR\r\n\r\nThe country declaring war is named first.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Austria--Belgium, Aug. 28, 1914.\r\n  Austria--Japan, Aug. 27, 1914.\r\n  Austria--Montenegro, Aug. 9, 1914.\r\n  Austria--Russia, Aug. 6, 1914.\r\n  Austria--Serbia, July 28, 1914.\r\n  Brazil--Germany, Oct. 26, 1917.\r\n  Bulgaria--Serbia, Oct. 14, 1915.\r\n  China--Austria, Aug. 14, 1917.\r\n  China--Germany, Aug. 14, 1917.\r\n  Cuba--Germany, April 7, 1917.\r\n  France--Austria, Aug. 13, 1914.\r\n  France--Bulgaria, Oct. 16, 1915.\r\n  France--Germany, Aug. 3, 1914.\r\n  France--Turkey, Nov. 5, 1914.\r\n  Germany--Belgium, Aug. 4, 1914.\r\n  Germany--France, Aug. 3, 1914.\r\n  Germany--Portugal, March 9, 1916.\r\n  Germany--Rumania, Sept. 14, 1916.\r\n  Germany--Russia, Aug. 1, 1914.\r\n  Great Britain--Austria, Aug. 13, 1914.\r\n  Great Britain--Bulgaria, Oct. 15, 1915.\r\n  Great Britain--Germany, Aug. 4, 1914.\r\n  Great Britain--Turkey, Nov. 5, 1914.\r\n  Greece--Bulgaria, Nov. 28, 1916.
