Those histories have shown how that class conducted war, how\r\nit governed its colonies, how it behaved to the continental Powers,\r\nhow it managed the first critical chapters of our relations with\r\nIndia, how it treated Ireland, how it developed the Parliamentary\r\nsystem, how it saved Europe from Napoleon. One history has only been\r\nsketched in outline: it is the history of the way in which this class\r\ngoverned England. The writers of this book have here attempted to\r\ndescribe the life of the poor during this period. It is their object\r\nto show what was in fact happening to the working classes under a\r\ngovernment in which they had no share. They found, on searching through\r\nthe material for such a study, that the subject was too large for a\r\nsingle book; they have accordingly confined themselves in this volume\r\nto the treatment of the village poor, leaving the town worker for\r\nseparate treatment. It is necessary to mention this, for it helps to\r\nexplain certain omissions that may strike the reader. The growth and\r\ndirection of economic opinion, for example, are an important part of\r\nany examination of this question, but the writers have been obliged\r\nto reserve the consideration of that subject for their later volume,\r\nto which it seems more appropriate. The writers have also found it\r\nnecessary to leave entirely on one side for the present the movement\r\nfor Parliamentary Reform which was alive throughout this period, and\r\nvery active, of course, during its later stages.\r\n\r\nTwo subjects are discussed fully in this volume, they believe, for the\r\nfirst time. One is the actual method and procedure of Parliamentary\r\nEnclosure; the other the labourers’ rising of 1830. More than one\r\nimportant book has been written on enclosures during the last few\r\nyears, but nowhere can the student find a full analysis of the\r\nprocedure and stages by which the old village was destroyed. The rising\r\nof 1830 has only been mentioned incidentally in general histories: it\r\nhas nowhere been treated as a definite demand for better conditions,\r\nand its course, scope, significance, and punishment have received\r\nlittle attention. The writers of this book have treated it fully, using\r\nfor that purpose the Home Office Papers lately made accessible to\r\nstudents in the Record Office. They wish to express their gratitude to\r\nMr. Hubert Hall for his help and guidance in this part of their work.\r\n\r\nThe obligations of the writers to the important books published in\r\nrecent years on eighteenth-century local government are manifest, and\r\nthey are acknowledged in the text, but the writers desire to mention\r\nspecially their great debt to Mr. Hobson’s _Industrial System_, a work\r\nthat seems to them to throw a new and most illuminating light on the\r\neconomic significance of the history of the early years of the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Arthur Ponsonby and Miss M. K. Bradby have done the\r\nwriters the great service of reading the entire book and suggesting\r\nmany important improvements. Mr. and Mrs. C. R. Buxton, Mr. A. Clutton\r\nBrock, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, and Mr. H. W. Massingham have given\r\nthem valuable help and advice on various parts of the work.\r\n\r\n HAMPSTEAD, _August 1911_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

In\r\nEngland the aristocracy had power and no privileges: in France the\r\naristocracy had privileges and no power. The one condition produced,\r\nas he read history, the blending of classes, a strong and vigorous\r\npublic spirit, the calm of liberty and order: the other a society\r\nlacking vitality and leadership, classes estranged and isolated, a\r\nconcentration of power and responsibility that impoverished private\r\neffort and initiative without creating public energy or public wealth.\r\n\r\nDe Tocqueville’s description of the actual state of France during\r\nthe eighteenth century has, of course, been disputed by later French\r\nwriters, and notably by Babeau. Their differences are important, but\r\nfor the moment we are concerned to note that in one particular they\r\nare in complete agreement. Neither Babeau, nor any other historian,\r\nhas questioned the accuracy of De Tocqueville’s description of the\r\nposition of the French nobles, from the day when the great cardinals\r\ncrushed their conspiracies to the day when the Revolution destroyed\r\nthe monarchy, whose heart and pulse had almost ceased to beat. The\r\ngreat scheme of unity and discipline in which Richelieu had stitched\r\ntogether the discords of France left no place for aristocracy. From\r\nthat danger, at any rate, the French monarchy was safe. Other dangers\r\nwere to overwhelm it, for Richelieu, in giving to it its final form,\r\nhad secured it from the aggressions of nobles but not from the follies\r\nof kings. _Tout marche, et le hasard corrige le hasard._ The soliloquy\r\nof Don Carlos in _Hernani_ contains an element of truth and hope for\r\ndemocracy which is wanting in all systems of personal government, where\r\nthe chances of recovery all depend on a single caprice. It was the\r\nsingle caprice that Versailles represented. It was the single caprice\r\nthat destroyed Richelieu’s great creation. When Louis XIV. took to\r\npiety and to Madame de Maintenon, he rescinded in one hour of fatal\r\nzeal the religious settlement that had given her prosperity to France.\r\nHer finance and her resources foundered in his hurricanes of temper and\r\nof arrogance. Louis XV. was known in boyhood as ‘the beloved.’ When\r\nhe fell ill in the campaign of 1744 in Flanders, all France wept and\r\nprayed for him. It would have been not less happy for him than it would\r\nhave been for Pompey if the intercessions of the world had died on\r\nthe breeze and never ascended to the ear of Heaven. When thirty years\r\nlater his scarred body passed to the royal peace of St. Denis, amid the\r\nbrutal jeers and jests of Paris, the history of the French monarchy\r\nwas the richer for a career as sensual and selfish and gross as that\r\nof a Commodus, and the throne which Richelieu had placed absolute and\r\nomnipotent above the tempests of faction and civil war had begun to\r\nrock in the tempests of two sovereigns’ passions.\r\n\r\nOne half-hearted attempt had indeed been made to change the form and\r\ncharacter of the monarchy. When he became regent in 1715, Orleans\r\nplayed with the ideas of St. Simon and substituted for the government\r\nof secretaries a series of councils, on which the great nobles sat,\r\nwith a supreme Council of Regency. As a departure from the Versailles\r\nsystem, the experiment at first excited enthusiasm, but it soon\r\nperished of indifference. The bureaucrats, whom Orleans could not\r\nafford to put on one side, quarrelled with the nobles: the nobles\r\nfound the business tedious and uninteresting: the public soon tired of\r\na scheme that left all the abuses untouched: and the regent, at the\r\nbest a lukewarm friend to his own innovation, had his mind poisoned\r\nagainst it by the artful imagination of Dubois. One by one the councils\r\nflickered out; the Council of the Regency itself disappeared in 1728,\r\nand the monarchy fell back into its old ways and habits.\r\n\r\nAs at Versailles, so in France. If the noble had been reduced to a\r\ntrifling but expensive cypher at the Court, the position of seigneur\r\nin the village was not very different. In the sixteenth century he\r\nhad been a little king. His relations with the peasants, with whom\r\nhis boyhood was often spent in the village school, were close and\r\nnot seldom affectionate. But though he was in many cases a gentle\r\nruler, a ruler he undoubtedly was, and royal ordinances had been found\r\nnecessary to curb his power. By the eighteenth century his situation\r\nhad been changed. There were survivals of feudal justice and feudal\r\nadministration that had escaped the searching eye of Richelieu, but\r\nthe seigneur had been pushed from the helm, and the government of the\r\nvillage had passed into other hands. It was the middle-class intendant\r\nand not the seigneur who was the master. The seigneur who still\r\nresided was become a mere rent receiver, and the people called him the\r\n‘_Hobereau_.’ But the seigneur rarely lived in the village, for the\r\nCourt, which had destroyed his local power, had drawn him to Paris to\r\nkeep him out of mischief, and when later the Court wished to change its\r\npolicy, the seigneur refused to change his habits. The new character of\r\nthe French nobility found its expression in its new homes. Just as the\r\ntedious splendour of Versailles, built out of the lives and substance\r\nof an exhausted nation, recorded the decadence and the isolation of the\r\nFrench monarchy, so in the countryside the new palaces of the nobles\r\nrevealed the tastes and the life of a class that was allowed no duties\r\nand forbidden no pleasures. The class that had once found its warlike\r\nenergy reflected in the castles of Chinon and Loches was now only at\r\nhome in the agreeable indolence of Azay le Rideau or the delicious\r\nextravagance of Chenonceaux. The nobles, unable to feed their pride on\r\nan authority no longer theirs, refused no stimulant to their vanity\r\nand no sop to their avarice. Their powers had passed to the intendant;\r\ntheir land was passing to the bourgeois or the peasant; but their\r\nprivileges increased. Distinctions of rank were sharper edged. It was\r\nharder for a plebeian to become an officer under Louis XVI. than it\r\nhad been under Louis XIV., and the exemptions from taxation became a\r\nmore considerable and invidious privilege as the general burdens grew\r\nsteadily more oppressive. Nature had made the French nobleman less, but\r\ncircumstances made him more haughty than the English. Arthur Young,\r\naccustomed to the bearing of English landlords, was struck by the\r\nvery distant condescension with which the French seigneur treated the\r\nfarmer. The seigneur was thus on the eve of the Revolution a privileged\r\nmember of the community, very jealous of his precedence, quarrelsome\r\nabout trifles, with none of the responsibilities of a ruler, and with\r\nfew of the obligations of a citizen. It was an unenviable and an\r\nuninspiring position. It is not surprising that Fénelon, living in\r\nthe frivolous prison of Versailles, should have inspired the young\r\nDuke of Burgundy with his dream of a governing aristocracy, or that\r\nMademoiselle de Lespinasse should have described the public-spirited\r\nmembers of this class as caged lions, or that a nobleman of the fierce\r\nenergy of the Marquis de Mirabeau should have been driven to divide\r\nhis time between the public prosecution of his noisy and interminable\r\nquarrels with his wife and his sons, and the composition of his feeling\r\ntreatise on _L’Ami des Hommes_.\r\n\r\nFor in the France whose king had no thought save for hunting, women\r\nand morbid disease, there was endless energy and intellectual life.\r\nFrance sparkled with ideas. The enthusiasms of the economists and\r\nphilosophers filled the minds of nobles who in England would have been\r\nimmersed in the practical duties of administration. The atmosphere of\r\nsocial sensibility melted the dry language of official reports, and\r\nthe intendants themselves dropped a graceful tear over the miseries of\r\nthe peasants. Amid the decadence of the monarchy and the uncivilised\r\nand untamed license of Louis XV., there flourished the emancipating\r\nminds of Voltaire, Montesquieu, Diderot and Quesnai, as well as\r\nRousseau, the passion and the spirit of the Revolution. On the one\r\nside is Versailles, abandoned to gross and shameless pleasures, on\r\nthe other a society pursuing here a warm light of reason and science\r\nwith a noble rage for progress and improvement, bewitched there by the\r\nNouvelle Héloïse and Clarissa, delighting in those storms of the senses\r\nthat were sweeping over France. The memoirs, the art, the literature\r\nof the time are full of these worlds, ruled, one by philosophy and\r\nillumination, the other by the gospel of sensibility and tender\r\nfeeling, the two mingling in a single atmosphere in such a salon as\r\nthat of Julie de Lespinasse, or in such a mind as that of Diderot.\r\nA kind of public life tries, too, to break out of its prison in the\r\nzealous, if somewhat mistaken exertions of agricultural societies and\r\nbenevolent landowners. But amid all this vitality and inspiration and\r\nenergy of mind and taste, the government and the fortunes of the race\r\ndepend ultimately on Versailles, who lives apart, her voluptuous sleep\r\nundisturbed by the play of thought and hope and eager curiosity, wrapt\r\nand isolated in her scarlet sins.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis XVI. called to office Turgot, fresh from his reforms at\r\nLimoges, it looked as if the intellect of France might be harnessed to\r\nthe monarchy. The philosophers believed that their radiant dreams were\r\nabout to come gloriously true. Richelieu had planned his system for an\r\nenergetic minister and a docile king; Turgot had not less energy than\r\nRichelieu, and Turgot’s master was not more ambitious than Louis XIII.\r\nBut the new régime lasted less than two years, for Louis XVI., cowed by\r\ncourtiers and ruled by a queen who could not sacrifice her pleasures to\r\nthe peace of France, dismissed his minister, the hopes of the reformers\r\nwere destroyed, and France settled down to the unrolling of events.\r\nThe monarchy was almost dead. It went out in a splendid catastrophe,\r\nbut it was already spent and exhausted before the States-General were\r\nsummoned. This vast, centralised scheme was run down, exhausted by the\r\nextravagance of the Court, unable to discharge its functions, causing\r\nwidespread misery by its portentous failure. The monarchy that the\r\nRevolution destroyed was anarchy. Spenser talks in the _Faerie Queene_\r\nof a little sucking-fish called the remora, which collects on the\r\nbottom of a ship and slowly and invisibly, but surely, arrests its\r\nprogress. The last kings were like the remora, fastening themselves on\r\nRichelieu’s creation and steadily and gradually depriving it of power\r\nand life.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that De Tocqueville, surveying these two centuries of\r\nnational life, so full of mischief, misdirection and waste, seeing,\r\ntoo, in the new régime the survival of many features that he condemned\r\nin the old, should have traced all the calamities of France to the\r\nabsence of a ruling aristocracy. It was natural that in such a temper\r\nand with such preoccupations he should have turned wistfully and not\r\ncritically to England, for if France was the State in which the nobles\r\nhad least power, England was the State in which they had most. The\r\nRevolution of 1688 established Parliamentary Government. The manners\r\nand the blunders of James II. had stripped the Crown of the power that\r\nhis predecessor had gained by his seductive and unscrupulous politics,\r\nand when the great families settled with the sovereign of their\r\nchoice, their memories of James were too recent and vivid to allow\r\nthem to concede more than they could help to William. The Revolution\r\nput the law of the land over the will of the sovereign: it abolished\r\nhis suspending and dispensing powers, and it obliged him to summon\r\nParliament every year. It set up a limited monarchy with Parliament\r\ncontrolling the Crown. But though the Revolution gave England a\r\nconstitutional Parliamentary government, that government had no\r\nhomogeneous leadership, and it looked as if its effective force might\r\nbe dissipated in the chaos and confusion of ministries. In such a\r\nsituation one observer at least turned his eyes to France. There exists\r\nin the British Museum a paper by Daniel Defoe, written apparently for\r\nthe guidance of Harley, who was Secretary of State in 1704. In this\r\npaper Defoe dwelt on the evils of divided and dilatory government, and\r\nsketched a scheme by which his patron might contrive to build up for\r\nhimself a position like that once enjoyed by Richelieu and Mazarin.\r\nDefoe saw that the experiment meant a breach with English tradition,\r\nbut he does not seem to have seen, what was equally true, that success\r\nwas forbidden by the conditions of Parliamentary government and the\r\nstrength of the aristocracy. The scheme demanded among other things the\r\ndestruction of the new Cabinet system. As it happened, this mischievous\r\ncondition of heterogeneous administration, in which one minister\r\ncounterworked and counteracted another, came to an end in Defoe’s\r\nlifetime, and it came to an end by the consolidation of the system\r\nwhich he wished to see destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis was the work of Walpole, whose career, so uninviting to those who\r\nask for the sublime or the heroic in politics, for it is as unromantic\r\na story as can be desired of perseverance, and coarse method, and art\r\nwithout grace, and fruits without flowers, is one of the capital facts\r\nof English history. Walpole took advantage of the fortunate accident\r\nthat had placed on the throne a foreigner, who took no interest in\r\nEngland and did not speak her language, and laid the foundations of\r\nCabinet government. Walpole saw that if Parliamentary supremacy was to\r\nbe a reality, it was essential that ministers should be collectively\r\nresponsible, and that they should severally recognise a common aim and\r\ninterest; otherwise, by choosing incompatible ministers, the king could\r\nmake himself stronger than the Cabinet and stronger than Parliament. It\r\nis true that George III., disdaining the docility of his predecessors,\r\ndisputed later the Parliamentary supremacy which Walpole had thus\r\nestablished, and disputed it by Walpole’s own methods of corruption\r\nand intrigue. But George III., though he assailed the liberal ideas of\r\nhis time, and assailed them with an unhappy success, did not threaten\r\nthe power of the aristocracy. He wanted ministers to be eclectic and\r\nincoherent, because he wanted them to obey him rather than Parliament,\r\nbut his impulse was mere love of authority and not any sense or feeling\r\nfor a State released from this monopoly of class. Self-willed without\r\noriginality, ambitious without imagination, he wanted to cut the knot\r\nthat tethered the Crown to the Cabinet, but he had neither the will\r\nnor the power to put a knife in the system of aristocracy itself. He\r\nwished to set back the clock, but only by half a century, to the days\r\nwhen kings could play minister against minister, and party against\r\nparty, and not to the days of the more resolute and daring dreams of\r\nthe Stuart fancy. The large ideas of a sovereign like Henry of Navarre\r\nwere still further from his petty and dusty vision. He was so far\r\nsuccessful in his intrigues as to check and defeat the better mind of\r\nhis generation, but if he had won outright, England would have been\r\nruled less wisely indeed, but not less deliberately in the interests of\r\nthe governing families. Thus it comes that though his interventions are\r\nan important and demoralising chapter in the history of the century,\r\nthey do not disturb or qualify the general progress of aristocratic\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIn France there was no institution, central or local, in which the\r\naristocracy held power: in England there was no institution, central\r\nor local, which the aristocracy did not control. This is clear from a\r\nslight survey of Parliament and of local administration.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which this is true had probably not been generally\r\ngrasped before the publication of the studies of Messrs. Redlich and\r\nHirst, and Mr. and Mrs. Webb, on the history of local government or\r\nthe recent works of Dr. Slater and Professor Hasbach on the great\r\nenclosures. Most persons were aware of the enormous power of the\r\naristocracy, but many did not know that that power was greater at the\r\nend than at the beginning of the century. England was, in fact, less\r\nlike a democracy, and more remote from the promise of democracy when\r\nthe French Revolution broke out, than it had been when the governing\r\nfamilies and the governing Church, whose cautions and compromises and\r\nrestraint Burke solemnly commended to the impatient idealists of 1789,\r\nsettled their account with the Crown in the Revolution of 1688.\r\n\r\nThe corruptions that turned Parliamentary representation into the\r\nweb of picturesque paradoxes that fascinated Burke, were not new in\r\nthe eighteenth century. As soon as a seat in the House of Commons\r\ncame to be considered a prize, which was at least as early as the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century, the avarice and ambition of\r\npowerful interests began to eat away the democratic simplicity of the\r\nold English franchise. Thus, by the time of James I., England had\r\ntravelled far from the days when there was a uniform franchise, when\r\nevery householder who did watch and ward could vote at a Parliamentary\r\nelection, and when the practice of throwing the provision of the\r\nMembers’ wages upon the electorate discouraged the attempt to restrict\r\nthe franchise, and thereby increase the burden of the voters. Indeed,\r\nwhen the Whig families took over the government of England, the case\r\nfor Parliamentary Reform was already pressing. It had been admitted by\r\nsovereigns like Elizabeth and James I., and it had been temporarily\r\nand partially achieved by Cromwell. But the monopolies which had been\r\ncreated and the abuses which had been introduced had nothing to fear\r\nfrom the great governing families, and the first acts of the Revolution\r\nParliament, so far from threatening them, tended to give them sanction\r\nand permanence. Down to this time there had been a constant conflict\r\nwithin the boroughs between those who had been excluded from the\r\nfranchise and the minorities, consisting of burgage-holders or corrupt\r\ncorporations or freemen, who had appropriated it. These conflicts,\r\nwhich were carried to Parliament, were extinguished by two Acts, one\r\nof 1696, the other of 1729, which declared that the last determination\r\nin each case was final and irrevocable. No borough whose fate had been\r\nso decided by a Parliamentary committee could ever hope to recover its\r\nstolen franchise, and all these local reform movements settled down to\r\ntheir undisturbed euthanasia. These Acts were modified by a later Act\r\nof 1784, which allowed a determination to be disputed within twelve\r\nmonths, but by that time 127 boroughs had already received their final\r\nverdict: in the others, where the franchise was determined after 1784,\r\nthere was some revival of local agitation.\r\n\r\nThe boroughs that were represented in Parliament in the eighteenth\r\ncentury have been classified by Mr. Porritt, in his learned work, in\r\nfour categories. They were (1) Scot and lot and potwalloper boroughs,\r\n(2) Burgage boroughs, (3) Corporation boroughs, and (4) Freemen\r\nboroughs.\r\n\r\nThe Scot and lot boroughs, of which there were 59, ranged from Gatton,\r\nwith 135 inhabitants, to Westminster and Northampton. On paper they\r\napproached most nearly to the old conditions as to the franchise. A\r\nuniform qualification of six months residence was established in 1786.\r\nIn other respects the qualifications in these boroughs varied. In some\r\nthe franchise depended on the payment of poor rate or church rate: in\r\nothers the only condition was that the voter had not been a charge on\r\nthe poor rate. The boroughs of the second of these classes were called\r\npotwalloper, because the voter had to prove that he was an inhabitant\r\nin the borough, had a family, and boiled a pot there. This potwalloper\r\nfranchise was a survival from the days when freemen took their meals\r\nin public to prove that they did not depend on the table of a lord.\r\nIn the eighteenth century the potwalloper sometimes put his table in\r\nthe street to show that he had a vote. But these boroughs, in spite of\r\ntheir wide franchise, fell under the control of the aristocracy almost\r\nas completely as the others, for the reason that when the borough\r\nitself developed, the Parliamentary borough stood still, and in many\r\ncases the inhabitant householders who had the right to vote were the\r\ninhabitants of a small and ancient area of the town. All that was\r\nnecessary in such circumstances in order to acquire the representation\r\nof the borough, was to buy the larger part of the property within this\r\narea. This was done, for example, at Aldborough and at Steyning.\r\n\r\nThe Burgage boroughs were 39. They were Parliamentary boroughs in which\r\nthe right to vote attached exclusively to the possession of burgage\r\nproperties. The burgage tenants were the owners of land, houses, shops\r\nor gardens in certain ancient boroughs. The holders of these sites\r\nwere originally tenants who discharged their feudal obligations by a\r\nmoney payment, corresponding to the freeholder in the country, who held\r\nby soccage. They thus became the men of the township who met in the\r\nchurchyard or town hall. In many cases residence was unnecessary to the\r\nenjoyment of the franchise. The only qualification was the possession\r\nof title-deeds to particular parcels of land, or registration in the\r\nrecords of a manor. These title-deeds were called ‘snatch papers,’ from\r\nthe celerity with which they were transferred at times of election.\r\nThe burgage property that enfranchised the elector of Old Sarum was\r\na ploughed field. Lord Radnor explained that at Downton he held 99\r\nout of the 100 burgage tenures, and that one of the properties was in\r\nthe middle of a watercourse. At Richmond, pigeon-lofts and pig-styes\r\nconferred the franchise. In some cases, on the other hand, residence\r\nwas required; at Haslemere, for example, Lord Lonsdale settled a colony\r\nof Cumberland miners in order to satisfy this condition. Sometimes the\r\nowner of a burgage property had to show that the house was occupied,\r\nand one proof of this was the existence of a chimney. In all of these\r\nboroughs the aristocracy and other controllers of boroughs worked\r\nhard, through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, to restrict\r\nthe number of properties that carried the right to vote. The holder\r\nof burgage property and the borough patron had a common interest in\r\nthese restrictions. The burgage boroughs provided a great many cases\r\nfor the decision of Parliamentary committees, and the borough owners\r\nmortgaged their estates under the strain of litigation of this kind.\r\nParliamentary committees had to determine for example whether the\r\nWidows’ Row at Petersfield really stood on the foundation of the house\r\nwhich conferred the franchise in the reign of William III. The most\r\nsuccessful borough-monger was the patron who had contrived to exclude\r\nfirst the non-burgage owners, and then the majority of the burgage\r\nowners, thus reducing his expenses within the narrowest compass.\r\n\r\nThe Corporation boroughs, or boroughs in which the corporation had\r\nacquired by custom the right to elect, independently of the burgesses,\r\nwere 43. In days when Parliamentary elections were frequent, the\r\ninhabitants of many boroughs waived their right of election and\r\ndelegated it to the corporations. When seats in the House of Commons\r\nbecame more valuable, the corporations were tenacious of this customary\r\nmonopoly, and frequently sought to have it established by charter.\r\nThese claims were contested in the seventeenth century, but without\r\nmuch success, and the charters bestowed at this time restricted the\r\nfranchise to the corporations in order to prevent ‘popular tumult,\r\nand to render the elections and other things and the public business\r\nof the said borough into certainty and constant order.’ It is easy to\r\ntrace in these transactions, besides the rapacity of the corporations\r\nthemselves, the influence of the landed aristocracy who were already\r\nbeginning to finger these boroughs. There was, indeed, an interval\r\nduring which the popular attacks met with some success. When Eliot and\r\nHampden were on the Committee of Privileges, some towns, including\r\nWarwick, Colchester, and Boston, regained their rights. But the\r\nRestoration was fatal to the movement for open boroughs, and though it\r\nwas hoped that the Revolution, which had been in part provoked by the\r\ntricks the Stuarts had played with the boroughs, would bring a more\r\nfavourable atmosphere, this expectation was defeated. All of these\r\nboroughs fell under the rule of a patron, who bribed the members of\r\nthe corporation with money, with livings or clerkships in the state\r\ndepartments, cadetships in the navy and in India. Croker complained\r\nthat he had further to dance with the wives and daughters of the\r\ncorporation at ‘tiresome and foolish’ balls. There was no disguise or\r\nmistake about the position. The patron spoke not of ‘my constituents’\r\nbut of ‘my corporation.’ The inhabitants outside this little group\r\nhad no share at all in Parliamentary representation, and neither the\r\npatron nor his nominee gave them a single thought. The members of the\r\ncorporation themselves were often non-resident, and the mayor sometimes\r\nnever went near the borough from the first day of his magistracy to the\r\nlast. His office was important, not because it made him responsible for\r\nmunicipal government, but because it made him returning officer. He had\r\nto manage the formalities of an election for his patron.\r\n\r\nThe Freemen boroughs, of which there were 62, represent in Mr.\r\nPorritt’s opinion the extreme divergence from the old franchise.\r\nIn these boroughs restrictions of different kinds had crept in, a\r\ncommon restriction being that in force at Carlisle, which limited\r\nthe franchise to the inhabitants who belonged to the trade guild.\r\nFor some time these restrictions, though they destroyed the ancient\r\nsignificance of ‘freeman’ as a person to be distinguished from the\r\n‘villein,’ did not really destroy the representative character of the\r\nelectorate. But these boroughs suffered like the others, and even more\r\nthan the others, from the demoralising effects of the appreciation\r\nof the value of seats in Parliament, and as soon as votes commanded\r\nmoney, the corporations had every inducement to keep down the number of\r\nvoters. In many boroughs there set in a further development that was\r\nfatal to the elementary principles of representation: the practice of\r\nselling the freedom of the borough to non-residents. There were three\r\nclasses of buyers: men who wanted to become patrons, men who wanted\r\nto become members, and men who wanted to become voters. The making of\r\nhonorary freemen became a favourite process for securing the control\r\nof a borough to the corporation or to a patron. Dunwich, which was a\r\nwealthy and famous seaport in the time of Henry II., gradually crumbled\r\ninto the German Ocean, and in 1816 it was described by Oldfield\r\nas consisting of forty-two houses and half a church. This little\r\nborough contained in 1670 forty resident freemen, and in that year it\r\nlargessed its freedom on four hundred non-residents. The same methods\r\nwere applied at Carlisle, King’s Lynn, East Grinstead, Nottingham,\r\nLiverpool, and in many other places. A particularly flagrant case\r\nat Durham in 1762, when 215 freemen were made in order to turn an\r\nelection, after the issue of the writ, led to a petition which resulted\r\nin the unseating of the member and the passing of an Act of Parliament\r\nin the following year. This Act excluded from the franchise honorary\r\nfreemen who had been admitted within twelve months of the first day\r\nof an election, but it did not touch the rights of ordinary freemen\r\nadmitted by the corporation. Consequently, when a Parliamentary\r\nelection was impending or proceeding, new freemen used to swarm into\r\nthe electorate whenever the corporation or the patron had need of\r\nthem. At Bristol in 1812 seventeen hundred and twenty freemen, and at\r\nMaldon in 1826 a thousand freemen, were so admitted and enfranchised.\r\nGenerally speaking, corporations seem to have preferred the method of\r\nexclusion to that of flooding the electorate with outside creations.\r\nOn the eve of the Reform Bill, there were six electors at Rye and\r\nfourteen at Dunwich. At Launceston, early in the eighteenth century,\r\nthe members of the corporation systematically refused freedom to all\r\nbut members of their own party, and the same practices were adopted\r\nat East Retford, Ludlow, Plympton, Hastings, and other places. Legal\r\nremedies were generally out of reach of the excluded freemen. There\r\nwere some exceptions to the abuses which prevailed in most of these\r\nboroughs, notably the case of the City of London. A special Act of\r\nParliament (1774) made it a condition of the enjoyment of the freemen’s\r\nfranchise there, that the freeman had not received alms, and that he\r\nhad been a freeman for twelve calendar months. But in most of these\r\nboroughs, by the end of the eighteenth century, the electorate was\r\nentirely under the influence of the corporations. Nor was the device of\r\nwithholding freedom from those qualified by custom, and of bestowing\r\nit on those who were only qualified by subservience, the only resource\r\nat the command of the borough-mongers. Charities were administered\r\nin an electioneering spirit, and recalcitrant voters were sometimes\r\nthreatened with impressment.\r\n\r\nOf the 513 members representing England and Wales in 1832, 415 sat for\r\ncities and boroughs. Fifty members were returned by 24 cities, 332 by\r\n166 English boroughs, 5 by single-member boroughs, 16 by the Cinque\r\nPorts, and 12 by as many Welsh boroughs. The twelve Welsh counties\r\nreturned 12 members, and the forty English counties 82, the remaining 4\r\nmembers being representatives of the Universities.\r\n\r\nThe county franchise had a much less chequered history than the\r\nvarious franchises in boroughs. Before the reign of Henry VI., every\r\nfree inhabitant householder, freeholder or non-freeholder, could vote\r\nat elections of Knights of the Shire. The Act of 1430 limited the\r\nfranchise to forty-shilling freeholders. Many controversies raged\r\nround this definition, and by the eighteenth century, men were voting\r\nin respect of annuities, rent-charges, the dowries of their wives and\r\npews in church. Mr. Porritt traces the faggot voter to the early days\r\nof Charles I. Two changes were made in the county franchise between\r\n1430 and 1832. The residential qualification disappears by 1620: in\r\n1702 a tax-paying qualification was introduced under which a property\r\ndid not carry a vote unless it had been taxed for a year. In 1781 the\r\nyear was cut down to six months. Great difficulties and irregularities\r\noccurred with regard to registration, and a Bill was passed into law in\r\n1784 to establish a public system of registration. The Act, however,\r\nwas repealed in the next year, in consequence of the agitation against\r\nthe expense. The county franchise had a democratic appearance but\r\nthe county constituencies were very largely under territorial sway,\r\nand by the middle of the fifteenth century Jack Cade had complained\r\nof the pressure of the great families on their tenants. Fox declared\r\nthat down to 1780 one of the members for Yorkshire had always been\r\nelected in Lord Rockingham’s dining-room, and from that time onwards\r\nthe representation of that county seems to have been a battle of bribes\r\nbetween the Rockinghams, the Fitzwilliams and the Harewoods.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see from this sketch of the manner in which the\r\nParliamentary franchise had been drawn into the hands of patrons and\r\ncorporations, that the aristocracy had supreme command of Parliament.\r\nControl by patrons was growing steadily throughout the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The Society of Friends of the People presented a petition to\r\nthe House of Commons in 1793, in which it was stated that 157 members\r\nwere sent to Parliament by 84 individuals, and 150 other members\r\nwere returned by the recommendation of 70 powerful individuals. The\r\nrelations of such members to their patrons were described by Fox in\r\n1797, ‘When Gentlemen represent populous towns and cities, then it is\r\na disputed point whether they ought to obey their voice or follow the\r\ndictates of their own conscience. But if they represent a noble lord or\r\na noble duke then it becomes no longer a question of doubt, and he is\r\nnot considered a man of honour who does not implicitly obey the orders\r\nof a single constituent.’[1] The petition of the Society of Friends\r\nof the People contained some interesting information as to the number\r\nof electors in certain constituencies: 90 members were returned by 46\r\nplaces, in none of which the number of voters exceeded 50, 37 ‘by 19\r\nplaces in none of which the number of voters exceeds 100, and 52 by\r\n26 in none of which the number of voters exceeded 200. Seventy-five\r\nmembers were returned for 35 places in which it would be to trifle with\r\nthe patience of your Honourable House to mention any number of voters\r\nat all,’ the elections at the places alluded to being notoriously a\r\nmatter of form.\r\n\r\nIf the qualifications of voters had changed, so had the qualifications\r\nof members. A power that reposed on this basis would have seemed\r\nreasonably complete, but the aristocracy took further measures to\r\nconsolidate its monopoly. In 1710 Parliament passed an Act, to which\r\nit gave the prepossessing title ‘An Act for securing the freedom of\r\nParliament, by further qualifying the Members to sit in the House of\r\nCommons,’ to exclude all persons who had not a certain estate of land,\r\nworth in the case of knights of the shire, £500, and in the case of\r\nburgesses, £300. This Act was often evaded by various devices, and\r\nthe most famous of the statesmen of the eighteenth century sat in\r\nParliament by means of fictitious qualifications, among others Pitt,\r\nBurke, Fox and Sheridan. But the Act gave a tone to Parliament, and\r\nit was not a dead letter.[2] It had, too, the effect of throwing the\r\nambitious merchant into the landlord class, and of enveloping him in\r\nthe landlord atmosphere. Selection and assimilation, as De Tocqueville\r\nsaw, and not exclusion, are the true means of preserving a class\r\nmonopoly of power. We might, indeed, sum up the contrast between the\r\nEnglish and French aristocracy by saying that the English aristocracy\r\nunderstood the advantages of a scientific social frontier, whereas\r\nthe French were tenacious of a traditional frontier. More effectual\r\nin practice than this imposition of a property qualification was the\r\ngrowing practice of throwing on candidates the official expenses of\r\nelections. During the eighteenth century these expenses grew rapidly,\r\nand various Acts of Parliament, in particular that of 1745, fixed these\r\ncharges on candidates.\r\n\r\nIt followed naturally, from a system which made all municipal\r\ngovernment merely one aspect of Parliamentary electioneering, that the\r\nEnglish towns fell absolutely into the hands of corrupt oligarchies\r\nand the patrons on whom they lived. The Tudor kings had conceived\r\nthe policy of extinguishing their independent life and energies by\r\ncommitting their government to select bodies with power to perpetuate\r\nthemselves by co-opting new members. The English aristocracy found\r\nin the boroughs--with the mass of inhabitants disinherited and all\r\ngovernment and power vested in a small body--a state of things not\r\nless convenient and accommodating to the new masters of the machine\r\nthan it had been to the old. The English towns, which three centuries\r\nearlier had enjoyed a brisk and vigorous public life, were now in a\r\nstate of stagnant misgovernment: as the century advanced, they only\r\nsank deeper into the slough, and the Report of the Commission of 1835\r\nshowed that the number of inhabitants who were allowed any share in\r\npublic life or government was infinitesimal. In Plymouth, for example,\r\nwith a population of 75,000, the number of resident freemen was under\r\n300: in Ipswich, with more than 20,000 inhabitants, there were 350\r\nfreemen of whom more than 100 were not rated, and some forty were\r\npaupers. Municipal government throughout the century was a system not\r\nof government but of property. It did not matter to the patron whether\r\nWinchester or Colchester had any drains or constables: the patron\r\nhad to humour the corporation or the freemen, the corporation or the\r\nfreemen had to keep their bargain with the patron. The patron gave\r\nthe corporation money and other considerations: the corporation gave\r\nthe patron control over a seat in Parliament. Neither had to consider\r\nthe interests or the property of the mass of burgesses. Pitt so far\r\nrecognised the ownership of Parliamentary boroughs as property, that he\r\nproposed in 1785 to compensate the patrons of the boroughs he wished to\r\ndisenfranchise. Every municipal office was regarded in the same spirit.\r\nThe endowments and the charities that belonged to the town belonged to\r\na small oligarchy which acknowledged no responsibility to the citizens\r\nfor its proceedings, and conducted its business in secret. The whole\r\nsystem depended on the patron, who for his part represented the\r\nabsolute supremacy of the territorial aristocracy to which he belonged.\r\nCivic life there was none.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to local government outside the towns there is the same\r\ndecay of self-government.\r\n\r\nOne way of describing the changes that came over English society after\r\nthe break-up of feudalism would be to say that as in France everything\r\ndrifted into the hands of the intendant, in England everything drifted\r\ninto the hands of the Justice of the Peace. This office, created in\r\nthe first year of Edward III., had grown during his reign to very\r\ngreat importance and power. Originally the Justices of the Peace were\r\nappointed by the state to carry out certain of its precepts, and\r\ngenerally to keep the peace in the counties in which they served.\r\nIn their quarterly sittings they had the assistance of a jury, and\r\nexercised a criminal jurisdiction concurrent with that which the king’s\r\njudges exercised when on circuit. But from early days they developed\r\nan administrative power which gradually drew to itself almost all the\r\nfunctions and properties of government. Its quasi-judicial origin is\r\nseen in the judicial form under which it conducted such business as\r\nthe supervision of roads and bridges. Delinquencies and deficiencies\r\nwere ‘presented’ to the magistrates in court. It became the habit,\r\nvery early in the history of the Justices of the Peace, to entrust to\r\nthem duties that were new, or duties to which existing authorities\r\nwere conspicuously inadequate. In the social convulsions that followed\r\nthe Black Death, it was the Justice of the Peace who was called in to\r\nadminister the elaborate legislation by which the capitalist classes\r\nsought to cage the new ambitions of the labourer. Under the Elizabethan\r\nPoor Law, it was the Justice of the Peace who appointed the parish\r\noverseers and approved their poor rate, and it was the Justice of the\r\nPeace who held in his hand the meshes of the law of Settlement. In\r\nother words, the social order that emerged from mediæval feudalism\r\ncentred round the Justice of the Peace in England as conspicuously\r\nas it centred round the bureaucracy in France. During the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the power of the Justice of the Peace reached its zenith,\r\nwhilst his government acquired certain attributes that gave it a\r\nspecial significance.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century there were still many\r\nsmall men taking some part in the affairs of the village. The old\r\nmanorial civilisation was disappearing, but Mr. and Mrs. Webb have\r\nshown that manor courts of one kind or another were far more numerous\r\nand had far more to do at the beginning of the eighteenth century\r\nthan has been commonly supposed. Such records as survive, those,\r\n_e.g._ of Godmanchester and Great Tew, prove that the conduct and\r\narrangement of the business of the common fields--and England was\r\nstill, at the beginning of this period, very largely a country of\r\ncommon fields--required and received very full and careful attention.\r\nThose courts crumble away as the common fields vanish, and with them\r\nthere disappears an institution in which, as Professor Vinogradoff has\r\nshown, the small man counted and had recognised rights. By the time of\r\nthe Reform Bill, a manor court was more or less of a local curiosity.\r\nThe village vestries again, which represented another successor to the\r\nmanorial organisation, democratic in form, were losing their vitality\r\nand functions, and coming more and more under the shadow of the\r\nJustices of the Peace. Parochial government was declining throughout\r\nthe century, and though Professor Lowell in his recent book speaks of\r\nvillage government as still democratic in 1832, few of those who have\r\nexamined the history of the vestry believe that much was left of its\r\ndemocratic character. By the end of the eighteenth century, the entire\r\nadministration of county affairs, as well as the ultimate authority in\r\nparish business, was in the hands of the Justice of the Peace, the High\r\nSheriff, and the Lord-Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this development was increased by the manner\r\nin which the administration of the justices was conducted. The\r\ntransactions of business fell, as the century advanced, into fewer and\r\nfewer hands, and became less and less public in form and method. The\r\ngreat administrative court, Quarter Sessions, remained open as a court\r\nof justice, but it ceased to conduct its county business in public.\r\nIts procedure, too, was gradually transformed. Originally the court\r\nreceived ‘presentments’ or complaints from many different sources--the\r\ngrand juries, the juries from the Hundreds, the liberties and the\r\nboroughs, and from constable juries. The grand juries presented county\r\nbridges, highways or gaols that needed repair: the Hundred juries\r\npresented delinquencies in their divisions: constable juries presented\r\nsuch minor anti-social practices as the keeping of pigs. Each of these\r\njuries represented some area of public opinion. The Grand Jury, besides\r\ngiving its verdict on all these presentments, was in other ways a very\r\nformidable body, and acted as a kind of consultative committee, and\r\nperhaps as a finance committee. Now all this elaborate machinery was\r\nsimplified in the eighteenth century, and it was simplified by the\r\nabandonment of all the quasi-democratic characteristics and methods.\r\nPresentments by individual justices gradually superseded presentments\r\nby juries. By 1835 the Hundred Jury and Jury of Constables had\r\ndisappeared: the Grand Jury had almost ceased to concern itself with\r\nlocal government, and the administrative business of Quarter Sessions\r\nwas no longer discussed in open court.\r\n\r\nEven more significant in some respects was the delegation of a great\r\npart of county business, including the protection of footpaths, from\r\nQuarter Sessions to Petty Sessions or to single justices out of\r\nsessions. Magistrates could administer in this uncontrolled capacity a\r\ndrastic code for the punishment of vagrants and poachers without jury\r\nor publicity. The single justice himself determined all questions of\r\nlaw and of fact, and could please himself as to the evidence he chose\r\nto hear. In 1822 the Duke of Buckingham tried and convicted a man of\r\ncoursing on his estate. The trial took place in the duke’s kitchen: the\r\nwitnesses were the duke’s keepers. The defendant was in this case not\r\na poacher, who was _fera naturæ_, but a farmer, who was in comparison\r\na person of substance and standing. The office of magistrate possessed\r\na special importance for the class that preserved game, and readers of\r\n_Rob Roy_ will remember that Mr. Justice Inglewood had to swallow his\r\nprejudices against the Hanoverian succession and take the oaths as a\r\nJustice of the Peace, because the refusal of most of the Northumberland\r\nmagistrates, being Jacobites, to serve on the bench, had endangered\r\nthe strict administration of the Game Laws. We know from the novels of\r\nRichardson and Fielding and Smollett how this power enveloped village\r\nlife. Richardson has no venom against the justices. In _Pamela_ he\r\nmerely records the fact that Mr. B. was a magistrate for two counties,\r\nand that therefore it was hopeless for Pamela, whom he wished to\r\nseduce, to elude his pursuit, even if she escaped from her duress in\r\nhis country house.\r\n\r\nFielding, who saw the servitude of the poor with less patience and\r\ncomposure, wrote of country life with knowledge and experience.\r\nIn _Joseph Andrews_ he describes the young squire who forbids the\r\nvillagers to keep dogs, and kills any dog that he finds, and the lawyer\r\nwho assures Lady Booby that ‘the laws of the land are not so vulgar to\r\npermit a mean fellow to contend with one of your ladyship’s fortune. We\r\nhave one sure card, which is to carry him before Justice Frolic, who\r\nupon hearing your ladyship’s name, will commit him without any further\r\nquestion.’ Mr. Justice Frolic was as good as his reputation, and at\r\nthe moment of their rescue Joseph and Fanny were on the point of being\r\nsent to Bridewell on the charge of taking a twig from a hedge. Fielding\r\nand Richardson wrote in the middle of the eighteenth century. In 1831\r\nDenman, the Attorney-General in Grey’s Government, commented on the\r\ndifference between the punishments administered by judges at Assize and\r\nthose administered by justices at Quarter Sessions, in the defence of\r\ntheir game preserves, observing that the contrast ‘had a very material\r\neffect in confusing in the minds of the people the notions of right\r\nand wrong.’ This territorial power was in fact absolute. In France the\r\npeasant was in some cases shielded from the caprice of the seigneur by\r\nthe Crown, the Parlements and the intendants. Both Henry IV. and Louis\r\nXIII. intervened to protect the communities in the possession of their\r\ngoods from the encroachments of seigneurs, while Louis XIV. published\r\nan edict in 1667 restoring to the communities all the property they had\r\nalienated since 1620. In England he was at the landlord’s mercy: he\r\nstood unprotected beneath the canopy of this universal power.\r\n\r\nNor was the actual authority, administrative or judicial, of the\r\nmagistrates and their surveillance of the village the full measure of\r\ntheir influence. They became, as Mr. and Mrs. Webb have shown, the\r\ndomestic legislature. The most striking example of their legislation\r\nwas the Berkshire Bread Act. In 1795 the Berkshire Court of Quarter\r\nSessions summoned justices and ‘several discreet persons’ to meet at\r\nSpeenhamland for the purpose of rating husbandry wages. This meeting\r\npassed the famous resolution providing for the supplementing of wages\r\nout of the rates, on a certain fixed scale, according to the price\r\nof flour. The example of these seven clergymen and eleven squires\r\nwas quickly followed in other counties, and Quarter Sessions used to\r\nhave tables drawn up and printed, giving the justices’ scale, to be\r\nissued by the Clerk of the Peace to every acting magistrate and to\r\nthe churchwardens and overseers of every parish. It was a handful of\r\nmagistrates in the different counties, acting on their own initiative,\r\nwithout any direction from Parliament, that set loose this social\r\navalanche in England. Parliament, indeed, had developed the habit of\r\ntaking the opinion of the magistrates as conclusive on all social\r\nquestions, and whereas a modern elected local authority has to submit\r\nto the control of a department subject to Parliament, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury a non-elected local authority, not content with its own\r\nunchecked authority, virtually controlled the decisions of Parliament\r\nas well. The opposition of the magistrates to Whitbread’s Bill in 1807,\r\nfor example, was accepted as fatal and final.\r\n\r\nNow if the Crown had been more powerful or had followed a different\r\npolicy, the Justices of the Peace, instead of developing into\r\nautonomous local oligarchies, might have become its representatives.\r\nWhen feudal rights disappeared with the Wars of the Roses, the\r\nauthority of the Justice of the Peace, an officer of the Crown,\r\nsuperseded that of the local lord. Mr. Jenks[3] is therefore justified\r\nin saying that ‘the governing caste in English country life since the\r\nReformation has not been a feudal but an official caste.’ But this\r\nofficial caste is, so to speak, only another aspect of the feudal\r\ncaste, for though on paper the representatives of the central power,\r\nthe county magistrates were in practice, by the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, simply the local squires putting into force their own ideas\r\nand policy. Down to the Rebellion, the Privy Council expected judges\r\nof assize to choose suitable persons for appointment as magistrates.\r\nMagistrates were made and unmade until the reign of George I.,\r\naccording to the political prepossessions of governments. But by the\r\nend of the eighteenth century the Lord Lieutenant’s recommendations\r\nwere virtually decisive for appointment, and dismissal from the bench\r\nbecame unknown. Thus though the system of the magistracy, as Redlich\r\nand Hirst pointed out, enabled the English constitution to rid itself\r\nof feudalism a century earlier than the continent, it ultimately gave\r\nback to the landlords in another form the power that they lost when\r\nfeudalism disappeared.\r\n\r\nAnother distinctive feature of the English magistracy contributed to\r\nthis result. The Justice of the Peace was unpaid. The statutes of\r\nEdward III. and Richard II. prescribed wages at the handsome rate of\r\nfour shillings a day, but it seems to be clear, though the actual\r\npractice of benches is not very easy to ascertain, that the wages in\r\nthe rare instances when they were claimed were spent on hospitality,\r\nand did not go into the pockets of the individual justices. Lord Eldon\r\ngave this as a reason for refusing to strike magistrates off the list\r\nin cases of private misconduct. ‘As the magistrates gave their services\r\ngratis they ought to be protected.’ When it was first proposed in 1785\r\nto establish salaried police commissioners for Middlesex, many Whigs\r\ndrew a contrast between the magistrates who were under no particular\r\nobligation to the executive power and the officials proposed to be\r\nappointed who would receive salaries, and might be expected to take\r\ntheir orders from the Government.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy was thus paramount both in local government and in\r\nParliament. But to understand the full significance of its absolutism\r\nwe must notice two important social events--the introduction of family\r\nsettlements and the abolition of military tenures.\r\n\r\nA class that wishes to preserve its special powers and privileges has\r\nto discover some way of protecting its corporate interests from the\r\nmisdemeanours and follies of individual members. The great landlords\r\nfound such a device in the system of entail which gave to each\r\nsuccessive generation merely a life interest in the estates, and kept\r\nthe estates themselves as the permanent possession of the family. But\r\nthe lawyers managed to elude this device of the landowners by the\r\ninvention of sham law-suits, an arrangement by which a stranger brought\r\na claim for the estate against the limited owner in possession, and got\r\na judgment by his connivance. The stranger was in truth the agent of\r\nthe limited owner, who was converted by this procedure into an absolute\r\nowner. The famous case known as Taltarums case in 1472, established\r\nthe validity of these lawsuits, and for the next two hundred years\r\n‘Family Law’ no longer controlled the actions of the landowners and the\r\nmarket for their estates. During this time Courts of Law and Parliament\r\nset their faces against all attempts to reintroduce the system of\r\nentails. As a consequence estates were sometimes melted down, and the\r\ninheritances of ancient families passed into the possession of yeomen\r\nand merchants. The landowners had never accepted their defeat. In\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth they tried to devise family settlements that\r\nwould answer their purpose as effectually as the old law of entail,\r\nbut they were foiled by the great judges, Popham and Coke. After the\r\nRestoration, unhappily, conditions were more propitious. In the first\r\nplace, the risks of the Civil War had made it specially important\r\nfor rich men to save their estates from forfeiture by means of such\r\nsettlements, and in the second place the landowning class was now\r\nall-powerful. Consequently the attempt which Coke had crushed now\r\nsucceeded, and rich families were enabled to tie up their wealth.[4]\r\nFamily settlements have ever since been a very important part of our\r\nsocial system. The merchants who became landowners bought up the\r\nestates of yeomen, whereas in eighteenth-century France it was the land\r\nof noblemen that passed to the _nouveaux riches_.\r\n\r\nThe second point to be noticed in the history of this landlord class\r\nis the abolition of the military tenures in 1660. The form and the\r\nmethod of this abolition are both significant. The military dues were\r\nthe last remaining feudal liability of the landlords to the Crown. They\r\nwere money payments that had taken the place of old feudal services.\r\nThe landlords, who found them vexatious and capricious, had been trying\r\nto get rid of them ever since the reign of James I. In 1660 they\r\nsucceeded, and the Restoration Parliament revived the Act of Cromwell’s\r\nParliament four years earlier which abolished military tenures. The\r\nbargain which the landlords made with the Crown on this occasion was\r\ningenious and characteristic; it was something like the Concordat\r\nbetween Francis I. and Leo X., which abolished the Pragmatic sanction\r\nat the expense of the Gallican Church; for the landowners simply\r\ntransferred their liability to the general taxpayer. The Crown forgave\r\nthe landlords their dues in consideration of receiving a grant from the\r\ntaxation of the food of the nation. An Excise tax was the substitute.\r\n\r\nNow the logical corollary of the abolition of the feudal dues that\r\nvexed the large landowners would have been the abolition of the feudal\r\ndues that vexed the small landowners. If the great landlords were no\r\nlonger to be subject to their dues in their relation to the Crown, why\r\nshould the small copyholder continue to owe feudal dues to the lord?\r\nThe injustice of abolishing the one set of liabilities and retaining\r\nthe other struck one observer very forcibly, and he was an observer\r\nwho knew something, unlike most of the governing class, from intimate\r\nexperience of the grievances of the small landowner under this feudal\r\nsurvival. This was Francis North (1637-1685), the first Lord Guildford,\r\nthe famous lawyer and Lord Chancellor. North had begun his career by\r\nacting as the steward of various manors, thinking that he would gain\r\nan insight into human nature which would be of great value to him in\r\nhis practice at the bar. His experience in this capacity, as we know\r\nfrom Roger North’s book _The Lives of the Norths_, disclosed to him an\r\naspect of feudalism which escaped the large landowners--the hardships\r\nof their dependants. He used to describe the copyhold exactions, and\r\nto say that in many cases that came under his notice small tenements\r\nand pieces of land which had been in a poor family for generations were\r\nswallowed up in the monstrous fines imposed on copyholders. He said he\r\nhad often found himself the executioner of the cruelty of the lords\r\nand ladies of manors upon poor men, and he remarked the inconsistency\r\nthat left all these oppressions untouched in emancipating the large\r\nlandowners. Maine, in discussing this system, pointed out that these\r\nsignorial dues were of the kind that provoked the French Revolution.\r\nThere were two reasons why a state of things which produced a\r\nrevolution in France remained disregarded in England. One was that the\r\nEnglish copyholders were a much smaller class: the other that, as small\r\nproprietors were disappearing in England, the English copyholder was\r\napt to contrast his position with the status of the landless labourer,\r\nand to congratulate himself on the possession of a property, whereas\r\nin France the copyholder contrasted his position with the status of\r\nthe freeholder and complained of his services. The copyholders were\r\nthus not in a condition to raise a violent or dangerous discontent,\r\nand their grievances were left unredressed. It is sometimes said that\r\nEngland got rid of feudalism a century earlier than the continent. That\r\nis true of the English State, but to understand the agrarian history of\r\nthe eighteenth century we must remember that, as it has been well said,\r\n‘whereas the English State is less feudal, the English land law is more\r\nfeudal than that of any other country in Europe.’[5]\r\n\r\nLastly, the class that is armed with all these social and political\r\npowers dominates the universities and the public schools. The story of\r\nhow the colleges changed from communities of poor men into societies of\r\nrich men, and then gradually swallowed up the university, has been told\r\nin the Reports of University Commissions. By the eighteenth century the\r\ntransformation was complete, and both the ancient universities were the\r\nuniversities of the rich. There is a passage in Macaulay describing the\r\nstate and pomp of Oxford at the end of the seventeenth century, ‘when\r\nher Chancellor, the venerable Duke of Ormonde, sat in his embroidered\r\nmantle on his throne under the painted ceiling of the Sheldonian\r\ntheatre, surrounded by hundreds of graduates robed according to their\r\nrank, while the noblest youths of England were solemnly presented to\r\nhim as candidates for academical honours.’ The university was a power,\r\nnot in the sense in which that could be said of a university like the\r\nold university of Paris, whose learning could make popes tremble, but\r\nin the sense that the university was part of the recognised machinery\r\nof aristocracy. What was true of the universities was true of the\r\npublic schools. Education was the nursery not of a society, but of an\r\norder; not of a state, but of a race of rulers.\r\n\r\nThus on every side this class is omnipotent. In Parliament with its\r\nludicrous representation, in the towns with their decayed government,\r\nin the country, sleeping under the absolute rule of the Justice of\r\nthe Peace, there is no rival power. The Crown is for all purposes its\r\naccomplice rather than its competitor. It controls the universities,\r\nthe Church, the law, and all the springs of life and discussion. Its\r\nown influence is consolidated by the strong social discipline embodied\r\nin the family settlements. Its supremacy is complete and unquestioned.\r\nWhereas in France the fermentation of ideas was an intellectual revolt\r\nagainst the governing system and all literature spoke treason, in\r\nEngland the existing régime was accepted, we might say assumed, by\r\nthe world of letters and art, by the England that admired Reynolds\r\nand Gibbon, or listened to Johnson and Goldsmith, or laughed with\r\nSheridan and Sterne. To the reason of France, the government under\r\nwhich France lived was an expensive paradox: to the reason of England,\r\nany other government than the government under which England lived was\r\nunthinkable. Hence De Tocqueville saw only a homogeneous society, a\r\nsociety revering its institutions in the spirit of Burke in contrast\r\nwith a society that mocked at its institutions in the spirit of\r\nVoltaire.\r\n\r\n‘You people of great families and hereditary trusts and fortunes,’\r\nwrote Burke to the Duke of Richmond in 1772, ‘are not like such as I\r\nam, who, whatever we may be by the rapidity of our growth and even\r\nby the fruit we bear, flatter ourselves that, while we creep on the\r\nground, we belly into melons that are exquisite for size and flavour,\r\nyet still we are but annual plants that perish with our season, and\r\nleave no sort of traces behind us. You, if you are what you ought to\r\nbe, are in my eye the great oaks that shade a country, and perpetuate\r\nyour benefits from generation to generation.’ We propose in this book\r\nto examine the social history of England in the days when the great\r\noaks were in the fulness of their vigour and strength, and to see what\r\nhappened to some of the classes that found shelter in their shade.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] House of Commons, May 26, 1797, on Grey’s motion for Parliamentary\r\nReform.\r\n\r\n[2] The only person who is known to have declined to sit on this\r\naccount is Southey.\r\n\r\n[3] _Outline of English Local Government_, p. 152.\r\n\r\n[4] A clear and concise account of these developments is given by Lord\r\nHobhouse, _Contemporary Review_, February and March 1886.\r\n\r\n[5] Holdsworth’s _History of English Law_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE BEFORE ENCLOSURE\r\n\r\n To elucidate these chapters, and to supply further information for\r\n those who are interested in the subject, we publish an Appendix\r\n containing the history, and tolerably full particulars, of twelve\r\n separate enclosures. These instances have not been chosen on any\r\n plan. They are taken from different parts of the country, and are of\r\n various dates; some are enclosures of common fields, some enclosures\r\n of commons and waste, and some include enclosures of both kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of the great Whig Revolution, England was in the main a\r\ncountry of commons and of common fields[6]; at the time of the Reform\r\nBill, England was in the main a country of individualist agriculture\r\nand of large enclosed farms. There has probably been no change in\r\nEurope in the last two centuries comparable to this in importance of\r\nwhich so little is known to-day, or of which so little is to be learnt\r\nfrom the general histories of the time. The accepted view is that this\r\nchange marks a great national advance, and that the hardships which\r\nincidentally followed could not have been avoided: that it meant a\r\nvast increase in the food resources of England in comparison with\r\nwhich the sufferings of individuals counted for little: and that the\r\ngreat estates which then came into existence were rather the gift of\r\neconomic forces than the deliberate acquisitions of powerful men. We\r\nare not concerned to corroborate or to dispute the contention that\r\nenclosure made England more productive,[7] or to discuss the merits of\r\nenclosure itself as a public policy or a means to agricultural progress\r\nin the eighteenth century. Our business is with the changes that the\r\nenclosures caused in the social structure of England, from the manner\r\nin which they were in practice carried out. We propose, therefore, to\r\ndescribe the actual operations by which society passed through this\r\nrevolution, the old village vanished, and rural life assumed its modern\r\nform and character.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us, who think of a common as a wild sweep of\r\nheather and beauty and freedom, saved for the enjoyment of the world\r\nin the midst of guarded parks and forbidden meadows, to realise that\r\nthe commons that disappeared from so many an English village in the\r\neighteenth century belonged to a very elaborate, complex, and ancient\r\neconomy. The antiquity of that elaborate economy has been the subject\r\nof fierce contention, and the controversies that rage round the\r\nnursery of the English village recall the controversies that raged\r\nround the nursery of Homer. The main subject of contention has been\r\nthis. Was the manor or the township, or whatever name we like to give\r\nto the primitive unit of agricultural life, an organisation imposed\r\nby a despotic landowner on his dependents, or was it created by the\r\nco-operation of a group of free tribesmen, afterwards dominated by a\r\nmilitary overlord? Did it owe more to Roman tradition or to Teutonic\r\ntendencies? Professor Vinogradoff, the latest historian, inclines to\r\na compromise between these conflicting theories. He thinks that it\r\nis impossible to trace the open-field system of cultivation to any\r\nexclusive right of ownership or to the power of coercion, and that\r\nthe communal organisation of the peasantry, a village community of\r\nshareholders who cultivated the land on the open-field system and\r\ntreated the other requisites of rural life as appendant to it, is\r\nmore ancient than the manorial order. It derives, in his view, from\r\nthe old English society. The manor itself, an institution which\r\npartakes at once of the character of an estate and of a unit of local\r\ngovernment, was produced by the needs of government and the development\r\nof individualist husbandry, side by side with this communal village.\r\nThese conditions lead to the creation of lordships, and after the\r\nConquest they take form in the manor. The manorial element, in fact,\r\nis superimposed on the communal, and is not the foundation of it: the\r\nmediæval village is a free village gradually feudalised. Fortunately it\r\nis not incumbent on us to do more than touch on this fascinating study,\r\nas it is enough for our purposes to note that the greater part of\r\nEngland in cultivation at the beginning of the eighteenth century was\r\ncultivated on a system which, with certain local variations, belonged\r\nto a common type, representing this common ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe term ‘common’ was used of three kinds of land in the\r\neighteenth-century village, and the three were intimately connected\r\nwith each other. There were (1) the arable fields, (2) the common\r\nmeadowland, and (3) the common or waste. The arable fields were divided\r\ninto strips, with different owners, some of whom owned few strips,\r\nand some many. The various strips that belonged to a particular owner\r\nwere scattered among the fields. Strips were divided from each other,\r\nsometimes by a grass band called a balk, sometimes by a furrow. They\r\nwere cultivated on a uniform system by agreement, and after harvest\r\nthey were thrown open to pasturage. The common meadow land was divided\r\nup by lot, pegged out, and distributed among the owners of the strips;\r\nafter the hay was carried, these meadows, like the arable fields, were\r\nused for pasture. The common or waste, which was used as a common\r\npasture at all times of the year, consisted sometimes of woodland,\r\nsometimes of roadside strips, and sometimes of commons in the modern\r\nsense.[8]\r\n\r\nSuch, roughly, was the map of the old English village. What were the\r\nclasses that lived in it, and what were their several rights? In a\r\nnormal village there would be (1) a Lord of the Manor, (2) Freeholders,\r\nsome of whom might be large proprietors, and many small, both classes\r\ngoing by the general name of Yeomanry, (3) Copyholders, (4) Tenant\r\nFarmers, holding by various sorts of tenure, from tenants at will to\r\nfarmers with leases for three lives, (5) Cottagers, (6) Squatters, and\r\n(7) Farm Servants, living in their employers’ houses. The proportions\r\nof these classes varied greatly, no doubt, in different villages,\r\nbut we have an estimate of the total agricultural population in the\r\ntable prepared by Gregory King in 1688, from which it appears that in\r\naddition to the Esquires and Gentlemen, there were 40,000 families of\r\nfreeholders of the better sort, 120,000 families of freeholders of the\r\nlesser sort, and 150,000 farmers. Adam Smith, it will be remembered,\r\nwriting nearly a century later, said that the large number of yeomen\r\nwas at once the strength and the distinction of English agriculture.\r\n\r\nLet us now describe rather more fully the different people represented\r\nin these different categories, and the different rights that they\r\nenjoyed. We have seen in the first chapter that the manorial courts\r\nhad lost many of their powers by this time, and that part of the\r\njurisdiction that the Lord of the Manor had originally exercised had\r\npassed to the Justice of the Peace. No such change had taken place\r\nin his relation to the economic life of the village. He might or he\r\nmight not still own a demesne land. So far as the common arable or\r\ncommon meadow was concerned, he was in the same position as any other\r\nproprietor: he might own many strips or few strips or no strips at all.\r\nHis position with regard to the waste was different, the difference\r\nbeing expressed by Blackstone ‘in those waste grounds, which are\r\nusually called commons, the property of the soil is generally in the\r\nLord of the Manor, as in the common fields it is in the particular\r\ntenant.’ The feudal lawyers had developed a doctrine that the soil of\r\nthe waste was vested in the Lord of the Manor, and that originally it\r\nhad all belonged to him. But feudal law acknowledged certain definite\r\nlimitations to his rights over the waste. The Statute of Merton, 1235,\r\nallowed him to make enclosures on the waste, but only on certain terms;\r\nhe was obliged to leave enough of the waste for the needs of his\r\ntenants. Moreover, his powers were limited, not only by the concurrent\r\nrights of freeholders and copyholders thus recognised by this ancient\r\nlaw, but also by certain common rights of pasture and turbary enjoyed\r\nby persons who were neither freeholders nor copyholders, namely\r\ncottagers. These rights were explained by the lawyers of the time as\r\nbeing concessions made by the Lord of the Manor in remote antiquity.\r\nThe Lord of the Manor was regarded as the owner of the waste, subject\r\nto these common rights: that is, he was regarded as owning the minerals\r\nand the surface rights (sand and gravel) as well as sporting rights.\r\n\r\nEvery grade of property and status was represented in the ranks of the\r\nfreeholders, the copyholders and the tenant farmers, from the man who\r\nemployed others to work for him to the man who was sometimes employed\r\nin working for others. No distinct line, in fact, can be drawn between\r\nthe small farmer, whether freeholder, copyholder or tenant, and the\r\ncottager, for the cottager might either own or rent a few strips; the\r\nbest dividing-line can be drawn between those who made their living\r\nmainly as farmers, and those who made their living mainly as labourers.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that no farmer, however large his holdings\r\nor property, or however important his social position, was at liberty\r\nto cultivate his strips as he pleased. The system of cultivation would\r\nbe settled for him by the Jury of the Manor Court, a court that had\r\ndifferent names in different places. By the eighteenth century the\r\nvarious courts of the manorial jurisdiction had been merged in a single\r\ncourt, called indifferently the View of Frankpledge, the Court Leet,\r\nthe Court Baron, the Great Court or the Little Court, which transacted\r\nso much of the business hitherto confided to various courts as had\r\nnot been assigned to the Justices of the Peace.[9] Most of the men of\r\nthe village, freeholders, copyholders, leaseholders, or cottagers,\r\nattended the court, but the constitution of the Jury or Homage seems\r\nto have varied in different manors. Sometimes the tenants of the manor\r\nwere taken haphazard in rotation: sometimes the steward controlled\r\nthe choice, sometimes a nominee of the steward or a nominee of the\r\ntenants selected the Jury: sometimes the steward took no part in the\r\nselection at all. The chief part of the business of these courts in the\r\neighteenth century was the management of the common fields and common\r\npastures, and the appointment of the village officers. These courts\r\ndecided which seed should be sown in the different fields, and the\r\ndates at which they were to be opened and closed to common pasture.\r\nUnder the most primitive system of rotation the arable land was divided\r\ninto three fields, of which one was sown with wheat, another with\r\nspring corn, and the third lay fallow: but by the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury there was a great variety of cultivation, and we find a\r\nnine years’ course at Great Tew in Oxfordshire, a six years’ course\r\nin Berkshire, while the Battersea common fields were sown with one\r\nuniform round of grain without intermission, and consequently without\r\nfallowing.[10]\r\n\r\nBy Sir Richard Sutton’s Act[11] for the cultivation of common fields,\r\npassed in 1773, a majority of three-fourths in number and value of the\r\noccupiers, with the consent of the owner and titheholder, was empowered\r\nto decide on the course of husbandry, to regulate stinted commons, and,\r\nwith the consent of the Lord of the Manor, to let off a twelfth of the\r\ncommon, applying the rent to draining or improving the rest of it.[12]\r\nBefore this Act, a universal consent to any change of system was\r\nnecessary.[13] The cultivation of strips in the arable fields carried\r\nwith it rights of common over the waste and also over the common\r\nfields when they were thrown open. These rights were known as ‘common\r\nappendant’ and they are thus defined by Blackstone: ‘Common appendant\r\nis a right belonging to the owners or occupiers of arable land to put\r\ncommonable beasts upon the Lord’s waste and upon the lands of other\r\npersons within the same manor.’\r\n\r\nThe classes making their living mainly as labourers were the cottagers,\r\nfarm servants, and squatters. The cottagers either owned or occupied\r\ncottages and had rights of common on the waste, and in some cases\r\nover the common fields. These rights were of various kinds: they\r\ngenerally included the right to pasture certain animals, to cut turf\r\nand to get fuel. The cottagers, as we have already said, often owned\r\nor rented land. This is spoken of as a common practice by Addington,\r\nwho knew the Midland counties well; Arthur Young gives instances from\r\nLincolnshire and Oxfordshire, and Eden from Leicestershire and Surrey.\r\nThe squatters or borderers were, by origin, a separate class, though\r\nin time they merged into the cottagers. They were settlers who built\r\nthemselves huts and cleared a piece of land in the commons or woods,\r\nat some distance from the village. These encroachments were generally\r\nsanctioned. A common rule in one part of the country was that the right\r\nwas established if the settler could build his cottage in the night\r\nand send out smoke from his chimney in the morning.[14] The squatters\r\nalso often went out as day labourers. The farm servants were usually\r\nthe children of the small farmers or cottagers; they lived in their\r\nmasters’ houses until they had saved enough money to marry and take a\r\ncottage of their own.\r\n\r\nWere there any day labourers without either land or common rights in\r\nthe old village? It is difficult to suppose that there were many.[15]\r\nBlackstone said of common appurtenant that it was not a general right\r\n‘but can only be claimed by special grant or by prescription, which the\r\nlaw esteems sufficient proof of a special grant or agreement for this\r\npurpose.’ Prescription covers a multitude of encroachments. Indeed, it\r\nwas only by the ingenuity of the feudal lawyers that these rights did\r\nnot attach to the inhabitants of the village at large. These lawyers\r\nhad decided in Gateward’s case, 1603, that ‘inhabitants’ were too\r\nvague a body to enjoy a right, and on this ground they had deprived\r\nthe inhabitants of the village of Stixswold in Lincolnshire of their\r\ncustomary right of turning out cattle on the waste.[16] From that time\r\na charter of incorporation was necessary to enable the inhabitants at\r\nlarge to prove a legal claim to common rights. But rights that were\r\nenjoyed by the occupiers of small holdings or of cottages by long\r\nprescription, or by encroachments tacitly sanctioned, must have been\r\nvery widely scattered.\r\n\r\nSuch were the classes inhabiting the eighteenth-century village. As\r\nthe holdings in the common fields could be sold, the property might\r\nchange hands, though it remained subject to common rights and to the\r\ngeneral regulations of the manor court. Consequently the villages\r\nexhibited great varieties of character. In one village it might happen\r\nthat strip after strip had been bought up by the Lord of the Manor or\r\nsome proprietor, until the greater part of the arable fields had come\r\ninto the possession of a single owner. In such cases, however, the land\r\nso purchased was still let out as a rule to a number of small men,\r\nfor the engrossing of farms as a practice comes into fashion after\r\nenclosure. Sometimes such purchase was a preliminary to enclosure. The\r\nBedfordshire reporter gives an example in the village of Bolnhurst, in\r\nthat county. Three land speculators bought up as much of the land as\r\nthey could with a view to enclosing the common fields and then selling\r\nat a large profit. But the land turned out to be much less valuable\r\nthan they had supposed, and they could not get it off their hands: all\r\nimprovements were at a standstill, for the speculators only let from\r\nyear to year, hoping still to find a market.[17] In other villages,\r\nland might have changed hands in just the opposite direction. The Lord\r\nof the Manor might sell his property in the common fields, and sell it\r\nnot to some capitalist or merchant, but to a number of small farmers.\r\nWe learn from the evidence of the Committee of 1844 on enclosures that\r\nsometimes the Lord of the Manor sold his property in the waste to the\r\ncommoners. Thus there were villages with few owners, as there were\r\nvillages with many owners. The writer of the _Report on Middlesex_,\r\nwhich was published in 1798 says, ‘I have known thirty landlords in\r\na field of 200 acres, and the property of each so divided as to lie\r\nin ten or twenty places, containing from an acre or two downwards to\r\nfifteen perches; and in a field of 300 acres I have met with patches\r\nof arable land, containing eight perches each. In this instance the\r\naverage size of all the pieces in the field was under an acre. In all\r\ncases they lie in long, narrow, winding or worm-like slips.’[18]\r\n\r\nThe same writer states that at the time his book was written (1798)\r\n20,000 out of the 23,000 arable acres in Middlesex were cultivated on\r\nthe common-field system.[19] Perhaps the parish of Stanwell, of which\r\nwe describe the enclosure in detail elsewhere, may be taken as a fair\r\nexample of an eighteenth-century village. In this parish there were,\r\naccording to the enclosure award, four large proprietors, twenty-four\r\nmoderate proprietors, twenty-four small proprietors, and sixty-six\r\ncottagers with common rights.\r\n\r\nThe most important social fact about this system is that it provided\r\nopportunities for the humblest and poorest labourer to rise in the\r\nvillage. Population seems to have moved slowly, and thus there was no\r\nfeverish competition for land. The farm servant could save up his wages\r\nand begin his married life by hiring a cottage which carried rights of\r\ncommon, and gradually buy or hire strips of land. Every village, as\r\nHasbach has put it, had its ladder, and nobody was doomed to stay on\r\nthe lowest rung. This is the distinguishing mark of the old village. It\r\nwould be easy, looking only at this feature, to idealise the society\r\nthat we have described, and to paint this age as an age of gold. But\r\nno reader of Fielding or of Richardson would fall into this mistake,\r\nor persuade himself that this community was a society of free and\r\nequal men, in which tyranny was impossible. The old village was under\r\nthe shadow of the squire and the parson, and there were many ways in\r\nwhich these powers controlled and hampered its pleasures and habits:\r\nthere were quarrels, too, between farmers and cottagers, and there are\r\nmany complaints that the farmers tried to take the lion’s share of the\r\ncommons: but, whatever the pressure outside and whatever the bickerings\r\nwithin, it remains true that the common-field system formed a world in\r\nwhich the villagers lived their own lives and cultivated the soil on a\r\nbasis of independence.\r\n\r\nIt was this community that now passed under the unqualified rule of\r\nthe oligarchy. Under that rule it was to disappear. Enclosure was\r\nno new menace to the poor. English literature before the eighteenth\r\ncentury echoes the dismay and lamentations of preachers and prophets\r\nwho witnessed the havoc that it spread. Stubbes had written in 1553 his\r\nbitter protest against the enclosures which enabled rich men to eat up\r\npoor men, and twenty years later a writer had given a sombre landscape\r\nof the new farming: ‘We may see many of their houses built alone like\r\nravens’ nests, no birds building near them.’ The Midlands had been\r\nthe chief scene of these changes, and there the conversion of arable\r\nland into pasture had swallowed up great tracts of common agriculture,\r\nprovoking in some cases an armed resistance. The enclosures of this\r\ncentury were the second and the greater of two waves.[20] In one\r\nrespect enclosure was in form more difficult now than in earlier\r\nperiods, for it was generally understood at this time that an Act\r\nof Parliament was necessary. In reality there was less check on the\r\nprocess. For hitherto the enclosing class had had to reckon with the\r\noccasional panic or ill-temper of the Crown. No English king, it is\r\ntrue, had intervened in the interests of the poor so dramatically as\r\ndid the earlier and unspoilt Louis XIV., who restored to the French\r\nvillage assemblies the public lands they had alienated within a certain\r\nperiod. But the Crown had not altogether overlooked the interests of\r\nthe classes who were ruined by enclosure, and in different ways it\r\nhad tried to modify the worst consequences of this policy. From 1490\r\nto 1601 there were various Acts and proclamations designed for this\r\npurpose. Charles I. had actually annulled the enclosures of two years\r\nin certain midland counties, several Commissions had been issued, and\r\nthe Star Chamber had instituted proceedings against enclosures on the\r\nground that depopulation was an offence against the Common Law. Mr.\r\nFirth holds that Cromwell’s influence in the eastern counties was due\r\nto his championship of the commoners in the fens. Throughout this time,\r\nhowever ineffectual the intervention of the Crown, the interests of the\r\nclasses to whom enclosures brought wealth and power were not allowed to\r\nobliterate all other considerations.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the eighteenth century the reins are thrown to\r\nthe enclosure movement, and the policy of enclosure is emancipated from\r\nall these checks and afterthoughts. One interest is supreme throughout\r\nEngland, supreme in Parliament, supreme in the country; the Crown\r\nfollows, the nation obeys.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural community which was taken to pieces in the eighteenth\r\ncentury and reconstructed in the manner in which a dictator\r\nreconstructs a free government, was threatened from many points. It was\r\nnot killed by avarice alone. Cobbett used to attribute the enclosure\r\nmovement entirely to the greed of the landowners, but, if greed was a\r\nsufficient motive, greed was in this case clothed and almost enveloped\r\nin public spirit. Let us remember what this community looked like to\r\nmen with the mind of the landlord class. The English landowners have\r\nalways believed that order would be resolved into its original chaos,\r\nif they ceased to control the lives and destinies of their neighbours.\r\n‘A great responsibility rests on us landlords; if we go, the whole\r\nthing goes.’ So says the landlord in Mr. Galsworthy’s novel, and so\r\nsaid the landlords in the eighteenth century. The English aristocracy\r\nalways thinking of this class as the pillars of society, as the\r\nAtlas that bears the burden of the world, very naturally concluded\r\nthat this old peasant community, with its troublesome rights, was a\r\npublic encumbrance. This view received a special impetus from all the\r\ncircumstances of the age. The landlord class was constantly being\r\nrecruited from the ranks of the manufacturers, and the new landlords,\r\nbringing into this charmed circle an energy of their own, caught at\r\nonce its taste for power, for direction, for authority, for imposing\r\nits will. Readers of _Shirley_ will remember that when Robert Moore\r\npictures to himself a future of usefulness and success, he says that\r\nhe will obtain an Act for enclosing Nunnely Common, that his brother\r\nwill be put on the bench, and that between them they will dominate the\r\nparish. The book ends in this dream of triumph. Signorial position\r\nowes its special lustre for English minds to the association of social\r\ndistinction with power over the life and ways of groups of men and\r\nwomen. When Bagehot sneered at the sudden millionaires of his day, who\r\nhoped to disguise their social defects by buying old places and hiding\r\namong aristocratic furniture, he was remarking on a feature of English\r\nlife that was very far from being peculiar to his time. Did not Adam\r\nSmith observe that merchants were very commonly ambitious of becoming\r\ncountry gentlemen? This kind of ambition was the form that public\r\nspirit often took in successful Englishmen, and it was a very powerful\r\nmenace to the old village and its traditions of collective life.\r\n\r\nNow this passion received at this time a special momentum from the\r\ncondition of agriculture. A dictatorship lends itself more readily\r\nthan any other form of government to the quick introduction of\r\nrevolutionary ideas, and new ideas were in the air. Thus, in addition\r\nto the desire for social power, there was behind the enclosure\r\nmovement a zeal for economic progress seconding and almost concealing\r\nthe direct inspiration of self-interest. Many an enclosing landlord\r\nthought only of the satisfaction of doubling or trebling his rent:\r\nthat is unquestionable. If we are to trust so warm a champion of\r\nenclosure as William Marshall, this was the state of mind of the great\r\nmajority. But there were many whose eyes glistened as they thought of\r\nthe prosperity they were to bring to English agriculture, applying\r\nto a wider and wider domain the lessons that were to be learnt from\r\nthe processes of scientific farming. A man who had caught the large\r\nideas of a Coke, or mastered the discoveries of a Bakewell, chafed\r\nunder the restraints that the system of common agriculture placed on\r\nimprovement and experiment. It was maddening to have to set your pace\r\nby the slow bucolic temperament of small farmers, nursed in a simple\r\nand old-fashioned routine, who looked with suspicion on any proposal\r\nthat was strange to them. In this tiresome partnership the swift were\r\nput between the shafts with the slow, and the temptation to think that\r\nwhat was wanted was to get rid of the partnership altogether, was\r\nalmost irresistible. From such a state the mind passed rapidly and\r\nnaturally to the conclusion that the wider the sphere brought into the\r\nabsolute possession of the enlightened class, the greater would be the\r\npublic gain. The spirit in which the Board of Agriculture approached\r\nthe subject found appropriate expression in Sir John Sinclair’s\r\nhigh-sounding language. ‘The idea of having lands in common, it has\r\nbeen justly remarked, is to be derived from that barbarous state of\r\nsociety, when men were strangers to any higher occupation than those\r\nof hunters or shepherds, or had only just tasted the advantages to\r\nbe reaped from the cultivation of the earth.’[21] Arthur Young[22]\r\ncompared the open-field system, with its inconveniences ‘which the\r\nbarbarity of their ancestors had neither knowledge to discover nor\r\ngovernment to remedy’ to the Tartar policy of the shepherd state.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that men under the influence of these set ideas\r\ncould find no virtue at all in the old system, and that they soon\r\nbegan to persuade themselves that that system was at the bottom of\r\nall the evils of society. It was harmful to the morals and useless to\r\nthe pockets of the poor. ‘The benefit,’ wrote Arbuthnot,[23] ‘which\r\nthey are supposed to reap from commons, in their present state, I\r\nknow to be merely nominal; nay, indeed, what is worse, I know, that,\r\nin many instances, it is an essential injury to them, by being made\r\na plea for their idleness; for, some few excepted, if you offer them\r\nwork, they will tell you, that they must go to look up their sheep,\r\ncut furzes, get their cow out of the pound, or, perhaps, say they must\r\ntake their horse to be shod, that he may carry them to a horse-race or\r\ncricket-match.’ Lord Sheffield, in the course of one of the debates in\r\nParliament, described the commoners as a ‘nuisance,’ and most people of\r\nhis class thought of them as something worse. Mr. John Billingsley, who\r\nwrote the _Report on Somerset_ for the Board of Agriculture in 1795,\r\ndescribes in some detail the enervating atmosphere of the commoners’\r\nlife. ‘Besides, moral effects of an injurious tendency accrue to the\r\ncottager, from a reliance on the imaginary benefits of stocking a\r\ncommon. The possession of a cow or two, with a hog, and a few geese,\r\nnaturally exalts the peasant, in his own conception, above his brethren\r\nin the same rank of society. It inspires some degree of confidence in\r\na property, inadequate to his support. In sauntering after his cattle,\r\nhe acquires a habit of indolence. Quarter, half, and occasionally\r\nwhole days are imperceptibly lost. Day labour becomes disgusting;\r\nthe aversion increases by indulgence; and at length the sale of a\r\nhalf-fed calf, or hog, furnishes the means of adding intemperance to\r\nidleness.’[24] Mr. Bishton, who wrote the _Report on Shropshire_ in\r\n1794, gives a still more interesting glimpse into the mind of the\r\nenclosing class: ‘The use of common land by labourers operates upon the\r\nmind as a sort of independence.’ When the commons are enclosed ‘the\r\nlabourers will work every day in the year, their children will be put\r\nout to labour early,’ and ‘that subordination of the lower ranks of\r\nsociety which in the present times is so much wanted, would be thereby\r\nconsiderably secured.’\r\n\r\nA similar view was taken of the moral effects of commons by Middleton,\r\nthe writer of the _Report on Middlesex_.[25] ‘On the other hand, they\r\nare, in many instances, of real injury to the public; by holding out\r\na lure to the poor man--I mean of materials wherewith to build his\r\ncottage, and ground to erect it upon: together with firing and the\r\nrun of his poultry and pigs for nothing. This is of course temptation\r\nsufficient to induce a great number of poor persons to settle upon the\r\nborders of such commons. But the mischief does not end here: for having\r\ngained these trifling advantages, through the neglect or connivance of\r\nthe lord of the manor, it unfortunately gives their minds an improper\r\nbias, and inculcates a desire to live, from that time forward, without\r\nlabour, or at least with as little as possible.’\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses before the Select Committee on Commons Inclosure\r\nin 1844 was Mr. Carus Wilson, who is interesting as the original of\r\nthe character of Mr. Brocklehurst in _Jane Eyre_. We know how that\r\nzealous Christian would regard the commoners from the speech in which\r\nhe reproved Miss Temple for giving the pupils at Lowood a lunch of\r\nbread and cheese on one occasion when their meagre breakfast had been\r\nuneatable. ‘Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt\r\nporridge, into these children’s mouths, you may indeed feed their vile\r\nbodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!’ We\r\nare not surprised to learn that Mr. Carus Wilson found the commoners\r\n‘hardened and unpromising,’ and that he was obliged to inform the\r\ncommittee that the misconduct which the system encouraged ‘hardens the\r\nheart, and causes a good deal of mischief, and at the same time puts\r\nthe person in an unfavourable position for the approach of what might\r\nbe serviceable to him in a moral and religious point of view.’[26]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, after reading all these confident generalisations\r\nabout the influence of this kind of life upon the character of the\r\npoor, to learn what the commoners themselves thought of its moral\r\natmosphere. This we can do from such a petition as that sent by the\r\nsmall proprietors and persons entitled to rights of common at Raunds,\r\nin Northamptonshire. These unfortunate people lost their rights by\r\nan Enclosure Act in 1797, and during the progress of the Bill they\r\npetitioned Parliament against it, in these terms: ‘That the Petitioners\r\nbeg Leave to represent to the House that, under Pretence of improving\r\nLands in the said Parish, the Cottagers and other Persons entitled to\r\nRight of Common on the Lands intended to be inclosed, will be deprived\r\nof an inestimable Privilege, which they now enjoy, of turning a certain\r\nNumber of their Cows, Calves, and Sheep, on and over the said Lands; a\r\nPrivilege that enables them not only to maintain themselves and their\r\nFamilies in the Depth of Winter, when they cannot, even for their\r\nMoney, obtain from the Occupiers of other Lands the smallest Portion of\r\nMilk or Whey for such necessary Purpose, but, in addition to this, they\r\ncan now supply the Grazier with young or lean Stock at a reasonable\r\nPrice, to fatten and bring to Market at a more moderate Rate for\r\ngeneral Consumption, which they conceive to be the most rational and\r\neffectual Way of establishing Public Plenty and Cheapness of Provision;\r\nand they further conceive, that a more ruinous Effect of this Inclosure\r\nwill be the almost total Depopulation of their Town, now filled with\r\nbold and hardy Husbandmen, from among whom, and the Inhabitants of\r\nother open Parishes, the Nation has hitherto derived its greatest\r\nStrength and Glory, in the Supply of its Fleets and Armies, and\r\ndriving them, from Necessity and Want of Employ, in vast Crowds, into\r\nmanufacturing Towns, where the very Nature of their Employment, over\r\nthe Loom or the Forge, soon may waste their Strength, and consequently\r\ndebilitate their Posterity, and by imperceptible Degrees obliterate\r\nthat great Principle of Obedience to the Laws of God and their Country,\r\nwhich forms the Character of the simple and artless Villagers, more\r\nequally distributed through the Open Countries, and on which so much\r\ndepends the good Order and Government of the State: These are some of\r\nthe Injuries to themselves as Individuals, and of the ill Consequences\r\nto the Public, which the Petitioners conceive will follow from this,\r\nas they have already done from many Inclosures, but which they did not\r\nthink they were entitled to lay before the House (the Constitutional\r\nPatron and Protector of the Poor) until it unhappily came to their own\r\nLot to be exposed to them through the Bill now pending.’[27]\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that the enterprise of the age was under the spell\r\nof the most seductive economic teaching of the time, and that the old\r\npeasant society, wearing as it did the look of confusion and weakness,\r\nhad to fear not only the simplifying appetites of the landlords, but\r\nthe simplifying philosophy, in England of an Adam Smith, in France of\r\nthe Physiocrats, we can realise that a ruling class has seldom found so\r\nplausible an atmosphere for the free play of its interests and ideas.\r\n_Des crimes sont flattés d’être présidés d’une vertu._ Bentham himself\r\nthought the spectacle of an enclosure one of the most reassuring of all\r\nthe evidences of improvement and happiness. Indeed, all the elements\r\nseemed to have conspired against the peasant, for æsthetic taste,\r\nwhich might at other times have restrained, in the eighteenth century\r\nencouraged the destruction of the commons and their rough beauty. The\r\nrage for order and symmetry and neat cultivation was universal. It\r\nfound expression in Burnet, who said of the Alps and Appenines that\r\nthey had neither form nor beauty, neither shape nor order, any more\r\nthan the clouds of the air: in Johnson, who said of the Highlands that\r\n‘the uniformity of barrenness can afford very little amusement to the\r\ntraveller’: and in Cobbett, who said of the Cotswolds, ‘this is a sort\r\nof country having less to please the eye than any other that I have\r\never seen, always save and except the heaths like those of Bagshot\r\nand Hindhead.’ The enjoyment of wild nature was a lost sense, to be\r\nrediscovered one day by the Romanticists and the Revolution, but too\r\nlate to help the English village. In France, owing to various causes,\r\npart economic, part political, on which we shall touch later, the\r\npeasant persisted in his ancient and ridiculous tenure, and survived to\r\nbecome the envy of English observers: it was only in England that he\r\nlost his footing, and that his ancient patrimony slipped away from him.\r\n\r\nWe are not concerned at this juncture to inquire into the truth of the\r\nview that the sweeping policy of enclosure increased the productivity\r\nand resources of the State: we are concerned only to inquire into\r\nthe way in which the aristocracy gave shape and effect to it. This\r\nmovement, assumed by the enlightened opinion of the day to be\r\nbeneficent and progressive, was none the less a gigantic disturbance;\r\nit broke up the old village life; it transferred a great body of\r\nproperty; it touched a vast mass of interests at a hundred points. A\r\ngoverning class that cared for its reputation for justice would clearly\r\nregard it as of sovereign importance that this delicate network of\r\nrights and claims should not be roughly disentangled by the sheer power\r\nof the stronger: a governing class that recognised its responsibility\r\nfor the happiness and order of the State would clearly regard it as\r\nof sovereign importance that this ancient community should not be\r\ndissolved in such a manner as to plunge great numbers of contented men\r\ninto permanent poverty and despair. To decide how far the aristocracy\r\nthat presided over these changes displayed insight or foresight,\r\nsympathy or imagination, and how far it acted with a controlling\r\nsense of integrity and public spirit, we must analyse the methods and\r\nprocedure of Parliamentary enclosure.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on a discussion of the methods by which Parliamentary\r\nenclosure was effected, it is necessary to realise the extent of its\r\noperations. Precise statistics, of course, are not to be had, but\r\nthere are various estimates based on careful study of such evidence as\r\nwe possess. Mr. Levy says that between 1702 and 1760 there were only\r\n246 Acts, affecting about 400,000 acres, and that in the next fifty\r\nyears the Acts had reached a total of 2438, affecting almost five\r\nmillion acres.[28] Mr. Johnson gives the following table for the years\r\n1700-1844, founded on Dr. Slater’s detailed estimate[29]--\r\n\r\n  +-----------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\r\n  |           |   Common Field and    |       Waste only.     |\r\n  |           |      some Waste.      |                       |\r\n  |   Years.  +---------+-------------+---------+-------------+\r\n  |           |  Acts.  |  Acreage.   |  Acts.  |   Acreage.  |\r\n  +-----------+---------+-------------+---------+-------------+\r\n  | 1700-1760 |    152  |    237,845  |     56  |     74,518  |\r\n  |           |         |             |         |             |\r\n  | 1761-1801 |  1,479  |  2,428,721  |    521  |    752,150  |\r\n  |           |         |             |         |             |\r\n  | 1802-1844 |  1,075  |  1,610,302  |    808  |    939,043  |\r\n  +-----------+---------+-------------+---------+-------------+\r\n  |  Total,   |  2,706  |  4,276,868  |  1,385  |  1,765,711  |\r\n  +-----------+---------+-------------+---------+-------------+\r\n\r\nThis roughly corresponds with the estimate given before the Select\r\nCommittee on Enclosures in 1844, that there were some one thousand\r\nseven hundred private Acts before 1800, and some two thousand between\r\n1800 and 1844. The General Report of the Board of Agriculture on\r\nEnclosures gives the acreage enclosed from the time of Queen Anne\r\ndown to 1805 as 4,187,056. Mr. Johnson’s conclusion is that nearly 20\r\nper cent. of the total acreage of England has been enclosed during\r\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, though Mr. Prothero puts the\r\npercentage still higher. But we should miss the significance of these\r\nproportions if we were to look at England at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century as a map of which a large block was already shaded,\r\nand of which another block, say a fifth or a sixth part, was to be\r\nshaded by the enclosure of this period. The truth is that the life of\r\nthe common-field system was still the normal village life of England,\r\nand that the land which was already enclosed consisted largely of old\r\nenclosures or the lord’s demesne land lying side by side with the\r\nopen fields. This was put quite clearly by the Bishop of St. Davids\r\nin the House of Lords in 1781. ‘Parishes of any considerable extent\r\nconsisted partly of old inclosures and partly of common fields.’[30] If\r\na village living on the common-field system contained old enclosures,\r\neffected some time or other without Act of Parliament, it suffered\r\njust as violent a catastrophe when the common fields or the waste were\r\nenclosed, as if there had been no previous enclosure in the parish.\r\nThe number of Acts passed in this period varies of course with the\r\ndifferent counties,[31] but speaking generally, we may say that the\r\nevents described in the next two chapters are not confined to any\r\none part of the country, and that they mark a national revolution,\r\nmaking sweeping and profound changes in the form and the character of\r\nagricultural society throughout England.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Gregory King and Davenant estimated that the whole of the\r\ncultivated land in England in 1685 did not amount to much more than\r\nhalf the total area, and of this cultivated portion three-fifths was\r\nstill farmed on the old common-field system.\r\n\r\n[7] For a full discussion, in which the ordinary view is vigorously\r\ncombated in an interesting analysis, see Hasbach, _History of the\r\nAgricultural Labourer_: on the other side, Levy, _Large and Small\r\nHoldings_.\r\n\r\n[8] This was the general structure of the village that was dissolved\r\nin the eighteenth century. It is distinguished from the Keltic type\r\nof communal agriculture, known as run-rig, in two important respects.\r\nIn the run-rig village the soil is periodically redivided, and the\r\ntenant’s holding is compact. Dr. Slater (_Geographical Journal_, Jan.\r\n1907) has shown that in those parts of England where the Keltic type\r\npredominated, _e.g._ in Devon and Cornwall, enclosure took place\r\nearly, and he argues with good reason that it was easier to enclose by\r\nvoluntary agreement where the holdings were compact than it was where\r\nthey were scattered in strips. But gradual enclosure by voluntary\r\nagreement had a different effect from the cataclysm-like enclosure of\r\nthe eighteenth century, as is evident from the large number of small\r\nfarmers in Devonshire.\r\n\r\n[9] See Webb, _Manor and Borough_, vol. i. p. 66 _seq._\r\n\r\n[10] Slater, _The English Peasantry and the Enclosure of Common\r\nFields_, p. 77.\r\n\r\n[11] 13 George III. c. 81.\r\n\r\n[12] This was done at Barnes Common; see for whole subject, _Annals of\r\nAgriculture_, vol. xvii. p. 516.\r\n\r\n[13] For cases where changes in the system of cultivation of common\r\nfields had been made, see _Annals of Agriculture_, vol. xvi. p. 606:\r\n‘To Peterborough, crossing an open field, but sown by agreement with\r\nturnips.’ Cf. _Report on Bedfordshire_: ‘Clover is sown in some of\r\nthe open clay-fields by common consent’ (p. 339), and ‘Turnips are\r\nsometimes cultivated, both on the sands and gravels, by mutual consent’\r\n(p. 340).\r\n\r\n[14] Slater, p. 119.\r\n\r\n[15] Dr. Slater’s conclusion is that ‘in the open field village the\r\nentirely landless labourer was scarcely to be found,’ p. 130.\r\n\r\n[16] See _Commons, Forests, and Footpaths_, by Lord Eversley, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[17] _Bedfordshire Report_, 1808, p. 223, quoting from Arthur Young.\r\n\r\n[18] P. 114.\r\n\r\n[19] P. 138.\r\n\r\n[20] See on this point, Levy, _Large and Small Holdings_, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[21] _Report of Select Committee on Waste Lands_, 1795, p. 15, Appendix\r\nB.\r\n\r\n[22] _Annals of Agriculture_, vol. i. p. 72.\r\n\r\n[23] _An Inquiry into the Connection between the present Price of\r\nProvisions and the Size of Farms_, 1773, p. 81.\r\n\r\n[24] _Report on Somerset_, reprinted 1797, p. 52; compare Report on\r\nCommons in Brecknock, _Annals of Agriculture_, vol. xxii. p. 632,\r\nwhere commons are denounced as ‘hurtful to society by holding forth a\r\ntemptation to idleness, that fell parent to vice and immorality’; also\r\ncompare _Ibid._, vol. xx. p. 145, where they are said to encourage the\r\ncommoners to be ‘hedge breakers, pilferers, nightly trespassers ...\r\npoultry and rabbit stealers, or such like.’\r\n\r\n[25] P. 103.\r\n\r\n[26] _Committee on Inclosures_, 1844, p. 135.\r\n\r\n[27] _House of Commons Journal_, June 19, 1797.\r\n\r\n[28] _Large and Small Holdings_, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[29] _Disappearance of Small Landowner_, p. 90; Slater’s _English\r\nPeasantry and the Enclosure of Common Fields_, Appendix B.\r\n\r\n[30] _Parliamentary Register_, March 30, 1781.\r\n\r\n[31] See Dr. Slater’s detailed estimate.\r\n\r\n[32] There were probably many enclosures that had not the authority\r\neither of a special Act or of the Act of 1756, particularly in the more\r\ndistant counties. The evidence of Mr. Carus Wilson upon the committee\r\nof 1844 shows that the stronger classes interpreted their rights and\r\npowers in a liberal spirit. Mr. Carus Wilson had arranged with the\r\nother large proprietors to let out the only common which remained\r\nopen in the thirteen parishes in which his father was interested as a\r\nlarge landowner, and to pay the rent into the poor rates. Some members\r\nof the committee asked whether the minority who dissented from this\r\narrangement could be excluded, and Mr. Wilson explained that he and his\r\nconfederates believed that the minority were bound by their action,\r\nand that by this simple plan they could shut out all cattle from the\r\ncommon, except the cattle of their joint tenants.--_Committee on\r\nInclosures_, 1844, p. 127.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nENCLOSURE (1)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn enclosure, like most Parliamentary operations, began with a petition\r\nfrom a local person or persons, setting forth the inconveniencies of\r\nthe present system and the advantages of such a measure. Parliament,\r\nhaving received the petition, would give leave for a Bill to be\r\nintroduced. The Bill would be read a first and a second time, and\r\nwould then be referred to a Committee, which, after considering such\r\npetitions against the enclosure as the House of Commons referred to it,\r\nwould present its report. The Bill would then be passed, sent to the\r\nLords, and receive the Royal Assent. Finally, the Commissioners named\r\nin the Bill would descend on the district and distribute the land. That\r\nis, in brief, the history of a successful enclosure agitation. We will\r\nnow proceed to explore its different stages in detail.\r\n\r\nThe original petition was often the act of a big landowner, whose\r\nsolitary signature was enough to set an enclosure process in train.[33]\r\nBefore 1774 it was not even incumbent on this single individual to\r\nlet his neighbours know that he was asking Parliament for leave to\r\nredistribute their property. In that year the House of Commons made\r\na Standing Order providing that notice of any such petition should\r\nbe affixed to the church door in each of the parishes affected, for\r\nthree Sundays in the month of August or the month of September. This\r\nprovision was laid down, as we learn from the Report of the Committee\r\nthat considered the Standing Orders in 1775, because it had often\r\nhappened that those whose land was to be enclosed knew nothing whatever\r\nof transactions in which they were rather intimately concerned, until\r\nthey were virtually completed.[34]\r\n\r\nBut the publicity that was secured by this Standing Order, though it\r\nprevented the process of enclosure from being completed in the dark,\r\ndid not in practice give the village any kind of voice in its own\r\ndestiny. The promoters laid all their plans before they took their\r\nneighbours into the secret. When their arrangements were mature, they\r\ngave notice to the parish in accordance with the requirements of the\r\nStanding Order, or they first took their petition to the various\r\nproprietors for signature, or in some cases they called a public\r\nmeeting. The facts set out in the petition against the Enclosure Bill\r\nfor Haute Huntre, show that the promoters did not think that they were\r\nbound to accept the opinion of a meeting. In that case ‘the great\r\nmajority’ were hostile, but the promoters proceeded with their petition\r\nnotwithstanding.[35] Whatever the precise method, unless some large\r\nproprietor stood out against the scheme, the promoters were masters of\r\nthe situation. This we know from the evidence of witnesses favourable\r\nto enclosure. ‘The proprietors of large estates,’ said Arthur Young,\r\n‘generally agree upon the measure, adjust the principal points among\r\nthemselves, and fix upon their attorney before they appoint any general\r\nmeeting of the proprietors.’[36] Addington, in his _Inquiry into the\r\nReasons for and against Inclosing_, quoting another writer, says, ‘the\r\nwhole plan is generally settled between the solicitor and two or three\r\nprincipal proprietors without ever letting the rest of them into the\r\nsecret till they are called upon to sign the petition.’[37] What stand\r\ncould the small proprietor hope to make against such forces? The matter\r\nwas a _chose jugée_, and his assent a mere formality. If he tried to\r\nresist, he could be warned that the success of the enclosure petition\r\nwas certain, and that those who obstructed it would suffer, as those\r\nwho assisted it would gain, in the final award. His only prospect of\r\nsuccessful opposition to the lord of the manor, the magistrate, the\r\nimpropriator of the tithes, the powers that enveloped his life, the\r\npowers that appointed the commissioner who was to make the ultimate\r\naward, lay in his ability to move a dim and distant Parliament of\r\ngreat landlords to come to his rescue. It needs no very penetrating\r\nimagination to picture what would have happened in a village in which a\r\nlandowner of the type of Richardson’s hero in _Pamela_ was bent on an\r\nenclosure, and the inhabitants, being men like Goodman Andrews, knew\r\nthat enclosure meant their ruin. What, in point of fact, could the poor\r\ndo to declare their opposition? They could tear down the notices from\r\nthe church doors:[38] they could break up a public meeting, if one\r\nwere held: but the only way in which they could protest was by violent\r\nand disorderly proceedings, which made no impression at all upon\r\nParliament, and which the forces of law and order could, if necessary,\r\nbe summoned to quell.\r\n\r\nThe scene now shifts to Parliament, the High Court of Justice, the\r\nstronghold of the liberties of Englishmen. Parliament hears the\r\npetition, and, almost as a matter of course, grants it, giving leave\r\nfor the introduction of a Bill, and instructing the member who\r\npresents the petition to prepare it. This is not a very long business,\r\nfor the promoters have generally taken the trouble to prepare their\r\nBill in advance. The Bill is submitted, read a first and second\r\ntime, and then referred to a Committee. Now a modern Parliamentary\r\nPrivate Bill Committee is regarded as a tribunal whose integrity and\r\nimpartiality are beyond question, and justly, for the most elaborate\r\nprecautions are taken to secure that it shall deserve this character.\r\nThe eighteenth-century Parliament treated its Committee with just as\r\nmuch respect, but took no precautions at all to obtain a disinterested\r\ncourt. Indeed, the committee that considered an enclosure was chosen\r\non the very contrary principle. This we know, not from the evidence of\r\nunkind and prejudiced outsiders, but from the Report of the Committee\r\nof the House of Commons, which inquired in 1825 into the constitution\r\nof Committees on Private Bills. ‘Under the present system each Bill\r\nis committed to the Member who is charged with its management and\r\nsuch other Members as he may choose to name in the House, and the\r\nMembers serving for a particular County (usually the County immediately\r\nconnected with the object of the Bill) _and the adjoining Counties_,\r\nand consequently it has been practically found that the Members to whom\r\nBills have been committed have been generally those who have been most\r\ninterested in the result.’\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there developed the\r\npractice of opening the committees. This was the system of applying to\r\nPrivate Bills the procedure followed in the case of Public Bills, and\r\nproposing a resolution in the House of Commons that ‘all who attend\r\nshall have voices,’ _i.e._ that any member of the House who cared\r\nto attend the committee should be able to vote. We can see how this\r\narrangement acted. It might happen that some of the county members were\r\nhostile to a particular enclosure scheme; in that case the promoters\r\ncould call for an open committee and mass their friends upon it. It\r\nmight happen, on the other hand, that the committee was solid in\r\nsupporting an enclosure, and that some powerful person in the House\r\nconsidered that his interests, or the interests of his friend, had\r\nnot been duly consulted in the division of the spoil. In such a case\r\nhe would call for all to ‘have voices’ and so compel the promoters to\r\nsatisfy his claims. This system then secured some sort of rough justice\r\nas between the powerful interests represented in Parliament, but it\r\nleft the small proprietors and the cottagers, who were unrepresented in\r\nthis mêlée, absolutely at the mercy of these conflicting forces.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, for example, to imagine that a committee in which\r\nthe small men were represented would have sanctioned the amazing\r\nclause in the Ashelworth Act[39] which provided ‘that all fields or\r\ninclosures containing the Property of Two or more Persons within one\r\nfence, and also all inclosures containing the property of one Person\r\nonly, if the same be held by or under different Tenures or Interests,\r\nshall be considered as commonable land and be divided and allotted\r\naccordingly.’ This clause, taken with the clause that follows, simply\r\nmeant that some big landowner had his eye on some particular piece of\r\nenclosed property, which in the ordinary way would not have gone into\r\nthe melting-pot at all. The arrangements of the Wakefield Act would\r\nhardly have survived the scrutiny of a committee on which the Duke of\r\nLeeds’ class was not paramount. Under that Act[40] the duke was to have\r\nfull power to work mines and get minerals, and those proprietors whose\r\npremises suffered in consequence were to have reasonable satisfaction,\r\nnot from the duke who was enriched by the disturbing cause, but\r\nfrom all the allottees, including presumably those whose property\r\nwas damaged. Further, to save himself inconvenience, the duke could\r\nforbid allottees on Westgate Moor to build a house for sixty years. A\r\ndifferent kind of House of Commons would have looked closely at the Act\r\nat Moreton Corbet which gave the lord of the manor all enclosures and\r\nencroachments more than twenty years old, and also at the not uncommon\r\nprovision which exempted the tithe-owner from paying for his own\r\nfencing.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the 1825 Committee describes the system as ‘inviting all\r\nthe interested parties in the House to take part in the business of\r\nthe committee, which necessarily terminates in the prevalence of the\r\nstrongest part, for they who have no interest of their own to serve\r\nwill not be prevailed upon to take part in a struggle in which their\r\nunbiassed judgment can have no effect.’ The chairman of the committee\r\nwas generally the member who had moved to introduce the Bill. The\r\nunreformed Parliament of landowners that passed the excellent Act\r\nof 1782, forbidding Members of Parliament to have an interest in\r\nGovernment contracts, never thought until the eve of the Reform Bill\r\nthat there was anything remarkable in this habit of referring Enclosure\r\nBills to the judgment of the very landowners who were to profit by\r\nthem. And in 1825 it was not the Enclosure Bills, in which the rich\r\ntook and the poor suffered, but the Railway Bills, in which rich men\r\nwere pitted against rich men, that drew the attention of the House of\r\nCommons to the disadvantages and risks of this procedure.\r\n\r\nThe committee so composed sets to work on the Bill, and meanwhile,\r\nperhaps, some of the persons affected by the enclosure send petitions\r\nagainst it to the House of Commons. Difficulties of time and space\r\nwould as a rule deter all but the rich dissentients, unless the\r\nenclosure was near London. These petitions are differently treated\r\naccording to their origin. If they emanate from a lord of the manor,\r\nor from a tithe-owner, who for some reason or other is dissatisfied\r\nwith the contemplated arrangements, they receive some attention. In\r\nsuch a case the petitioner probably has some friend in Parliament, and\r\nhis point of view is understood. He can, if necessary, get this friend\r\nto attend the committee and introduce amendments. He is therefore a\r\nforce to be reckoned with; the Bill is perhaps altered to suit him; the\r\npetition is at any rate referred to the committee. On the other hand,\r\nif the petition comes from cottagers or small proprietors, it is safe,\r\nas a rule, to neglect it.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure histories set out in the Appendix supply some good\r\nexamples of this differential treatment. Lord Strafford sends a\r\npetition against the Bill for enclosing Wakefield with the result that\r\nhe is allowed to appoint a commissioner, and also that his dispute with\r\nthe Duke of Leeds is exempted from the jurisdiction of the Enclosure\r\nCommissioners. On the other hand, the unfortunate persons who petition\r\nagainst the monstrous provision that forbade them to erect any building\r\nfor twenty, forty or sixty years, get no kind of redress. In the case\r\nof Croydon, James Trecothick, Esq., who is dissatisfied with the\r\nBill, is strong enough to demand special consideration. Accordingly a\r\nspecial provision is made that the commissioners are obliged to sell\r\nMr. Trecothick, by private contract, part of Addington Hills, if he so\r\nwishes. But when the various freeholders, copyholders, leaseholders and\r\ninhabitant householders of Croydon, who complain that the promoters\r\nof the Bill have named commissioners without consulting the persons\r\ninterested, ask leave to nominate a third commissioner, only four\r\nmembers of the House of Commons support Lord William Russell’s proposal\r\nto consider this petition, and fifty-one vote the other way. Another\r\nexample of the spirit in which Parliament received petitions from\r\nunimportant persons is furnished by the case of the enclosure of Holy\r\nIsland. In 1791 (Feb. 23)[41] a petition was presented to Parliament\r\nfor the enclosure of Holy Island, asking for the division of a stinted\r\npasture, and the extinction of the rights of common or ‘eatage’ over\r\ncertain infield lands. Leave was given, and the Bill was prepared and\r\nread a first time on 28th February. The same day Parliament received\r\na petition from freeholders and stallingers, who ask to be heard by\r\nthemselves or by counsel against the Bill. From Eden[42] we learn that\r\nthere were 26 freeholders and 31 stallingers, and that the latter were\r\nin the strict sense of the term as much freeholders as the former.\r\nWhilst, however, a freeholder had the right to put 30 sheep, 4 black\r\ncattle and 3 horses on the stinted common, a stallinger had a right\r\nof common for one horse and one cow only. The House ordered that this\r\npetition should lie on the table till the second reading, and that\r\nthe petitioners should then be heard. The second reading, which had\r\nbeen fixed for 2nd April, was deferred till 20th April, a change which\r\nprobably put the petitioners to considerable expense. On 20th April the\r\nBill was read a second time, and the House was informed that Counsel\r\nattended, and a motion was made that Counsel be now called in. But the\r\nmotion was opposed, and on a division was defeated by 47 votes to 12.\r\nThe Bill passed the House of Commons on 10th May, and received the\r\nRoyal Assent on 9th June.[43] In this case the House of Commons broke\r\nfaith with the petitioners, and refused the hearing it had promised.\r\nSuch experience was not likely to encourage dissentients to waste their\r\nmoney on an appeal to Parliament against a Bill that was promoted by\r\npowerful politicians. It will be observed that at Armley and Ashelworth\r\nthe petitioners did not think that it was worth the trouble and expense\r\nto be heard on Second Reading.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Committee followed a stereotyped formula: ‘That the\r\nStanding Orders had been complied with: and that the Committee had\r\nexamined the Allegations of the Bill and found the same to be true; and\r\nthat the Parties concerned had given their Consent to the Bill, to the\r\nSatisfaction of the Committee, except....’\r\n\r\nNow what did this mean? What consents were necessary to satisfy the\r\ncommittee? The Parliamentary Committee that reported on the cost of\r\nenclosures in 1800[44] said that there was no fixed rule, that in\r\nsome cases the consent of three-fourths was required, in others the\r\nconsent of four-fifths. This proportion has a look of fairness until we\r\ndiscover that we are dealing in terms, not of persons, but of property,\r\nand that the suffrages were not counted but weighed. The method by\r\nwhich the proportions were reckoned varied, as a glance at the cases\r\ndescribed in the Appendix will show. Value is calculated sometimes\r\nin acres, sometimes in annual value, sometimes in assessment to the\r\nland tax, sometimes in assessment to the poor rate. It is important to\r\nremember that it was the property interested that counted, and that in\r\na case where there was common or waste to be divided as well as open\r\nfields, one large proprietor, who owned a considerable property in old\r\nenclosures, could swamp the entire community of smaller proprietors\r\nand cottagers. If Squire Western owned an enclosed estate with parks,\r\ngardens and farms of 800 acres, and the rest of the parish consisted of\r\na common or waste of 1000 acres and open fields of 200 acres, and the\r\nvillage population consisted of 100 cottagers and small farmers, each\r\nwith a strip of land in the common fields, and a right of common on the\r\nwaste, Squire Western would have a four-fifths majority in determining\r\nwhether the open fields and the waste should be enclosed or not, and\r\nthe whole matter would be in his hands. This is an extreme example of\r\nthe way in which the system worked. The case of Ashelworth shows that\r\na common might be cut up, on the votes of persons holding enclosed\r\nproperty, against the wishes of the great majority of the commoners.\r\nAt Laleham the petitioners against the Bill claimed that they were\r\n‘a great majority of the real Owners and Proprietors of or Persons\r\ninterested in, the Lands and Grounds intended to be enclosed.’ At\r\nSimpson, where common fields were to be enclosed, the Major Part of the\r\nOwners and Proprietors petitioned against the Bill, stating that they\r\nwere ‘very well satisfied with the Situation and Convenience of their\r\nrespective Lands and Properties in their present uninclosed State.’[45]\r\n\r\nEven a majority of three-fourths in value was not always required; for\r\nexample, the Report of the Committee on the enclosure of Cartmel in\r\nLancashire in 1796 gave particulars showing that the whole property\r\nbelonging to persons interested in the enclosure was assessed at £150,\r\nand that the property of those actually consenting to the enclosure was\r\njust under £110.[46] Yet the enclosure was recommended and carried.\r\nAnother illustration is supplied by the Report of the Committee on\r\nthe enclosure of Histon and Impington in 1801, where the parties\r\nconcerned are reported to have consented except the proprietors of 1020\r\nacres, out of a total acreage of 3680.[47] In this case the Bill was\r\nrecommitted, and on its next appearance the committee gave the consents\r\nin terms of assessment to the Land Tax instead, putting the total\r\nfigure at £304, and the assessment of the consenting parties at £188.\r\nThis seems to have satisfied the House of Commons.[48] Further, the\r\nparticulars given in the case of the enclosure of Bishopstone in Wilts\r\n(enclosed in 1809) show that the votes of copyholders were heavily\r\ndiscounted. In this case the copyholders who dissented held 1079 acres,\r\nthe copyholders who were neuter 81 acres, and the total area to be\r\ndivided was 2602 acres. But by some ingenious actuarial calculation of\r\nthe reversionary interest of the lord of the manor and the interest\r\nof the tithe-owner, the 1079 acres held by copyholders are written\r\ndown to 474 acres.[49] In the cases of Simpson and Louth, as readers\r\nwho consult the Appendix will see, the committees were satisfied with\r\nmajorities just above three-fifths in value. At Raunds (see p. 39),\r\nwhere 4963 acres were ‘interested,’ the owners of 570 are stated to be\r\nagainst, and of 721 neuter.[50] An interesting illustration of the lax\r\npractice of the committees is provided in the history of an attempted\r\nenclosure at Quainton (1801).[51] In any case the signatures were a\r\ndoubtful evidence of consent. ‘It is easy,’ wrote an acute observer,\r\n‘for the large proprietors to overcome opposition. Coaxing, bribing,\r\nthreatening, together with many other acts which superiors will make\r\nuse of, often induce the inferiors to consent to things which they\r\nthink will be to their future disadvantage.’[52] We hear echoes of such\r\nproceedings in the petition from various owners and proprietors at\r\nArmley, who ‘at the instance of several other owners of land,’ signed\r\na petition for enclosure and wish to be heard against it, and also in\r\nthe unavailing petition of some of the proprietors and freeholders of\r\nWinfrith Newburgh in Dorsetshire, in 1768,[53] who declared that if the\r\nBill passed into law, their ‘Estates must be totally ruined thereby,\r\nand that some of the Petitioners by Threats and Menaces were prevailed\r\nupon to sign the Petition for the said Bill: but upon Recollection,\r\nand considering the impending Ruin,’ they prayed to ‘have Liberty to\r\nretract from their seeming Acquiescence.’ From the same case we learn\r\nthat it was the practice sometimes to grant copyholds on the condition\r\nthat the tenant would undertake not to oppose enclosure. Sometimes, as\r\nin the case of the Sedgmoor Enclosure, which we shall discuss later,\r\nactual fraud was employed. But even if the promoters employed no unfair\r\nmethods they had one argument powerful enough to be a deterrent in many\r\nminds. For an opposed Enclosure Bill was much more expensive than an\r\nunopposed Bill, and as the small men felt the burden of the costs much\r\nmore than the large proprietors, they would naturally be shy of adding\r\nto the very heavy expenses unless they stood a very good chance of\r\ndefeating the scheme.\r\n\r\nIt is of capital importance to remember in this connection that the\r\nenumeration of ‘consents’ took account only of proprietors. It ignored\r\nentirely two large classes to whom enclosure meant, not a greater or\r\nless degree of wealth, but actual ruin. These were such cottagers as\r\nenjoyed their rights of common in virtue of renting cottages to which\r\nsuch rights were attached, and those cottagers and squatters who either\r\nhad no strict legal right, or whose rights were difficult of proof.\r\nNeither of these classes was treated even outwardly and formally as\r\nhaving any claim to be consulted before an enclosure was sanctioned.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that it was only the pressure of the powerful\r\ninterests that decided whether a committee should approve or disapprove\r\nof an Enclosure Bill. It was the same pressure that determined the\r\nform in which a Bill became law. For a procedure that enabled rich men\r\nto fight out their rival claims at Westminster left the classes that\r\ncould not send counsel to Parliament without a weapon or a voice. And\r\nif there was no lawyer there to put his case, what prospect was there\r\nthat the obscure cottager, who was to be turned adrift with his family\r\nby an Enclosure Bill promoted by a Member or group of Members, would\r\never trouble the conscience of a committee of landowners? We have seen\r\nalready how this class was regarded by the landowners and the champions\r\nof enclosure. No cottagers had votes or the means of influencing a\r\nsingle vote at a single election. To Parliament, if they had any\r\nexistence at all, they were merely dim shadows in the very background\r\nof the enclosure scheme. It would require a considerable effort of the\r\nimagination to suppose that the Parliamentary Committee spent very much\r\ntime or energy on the attempt to give body and form to this hazy and\r\nremote society, and to treat these shadows as living men and women,\r\nabout to be tossed by this revolution from their ancestral homes. As it\r\nhappens, we need not put ourselves to the trouble of such speculation,\r\nfor we have the evidence of a witness who will not be suspected\r\nof injustice to his class. ‘This I know,’ said Lord Lincoln[54]\r\nintroducing the General Enclosure Bill of 1845, ‘that in nineteen\r\ncases out of twenty, Committees of this House sitting on private Bills\r\nneglected the rights of the poor. I do not say that they wilfully\r\nneglected those rights--far from it: but this I affirm, that they were\r\nneglected in consequence of the Committees being permitted to remain\r\nin ignorance of the claims of the poor man, because by reason of his\r\nvery poverty he is unable to come up to London for counsel, to produce\r\nwitnesses, and to urge his claims before a Committee of this House.’\r\nAnother Member[55] had described a year earlier the character of this\r\nprivate Bill procedure. ‘Inclosure Bills had been introduced heretofore\r\nand passed without discussion, and no one could tell how many persons\r\nhad suffered in their interests and rights by the interference of these\r\nBills. Certainly these Bills had been referred to Committees upstairs,\r\nbut everyone knew how these Committees were generally conducted. They\r\nwere attended only by honourable Members who were interested in them,\r\nbeing Lords of Manor, and the rights of the poor, though they might be\r\ntalked about, had frequently been taken away under that system.’\r\n\r\nThese statements were made by politicians who remembered well the\r\nsystem they were describing. There is another witness whose authority\r\nis even greater. In 1781 Lord Thurlow, then at the beginning of his\r\nlong life of office as Lord Chancellor,[56] spoke for an hour and three\r\nquarters in favour of recommitting the Bill for enclosing Ilmington\r\nin Warwickshire. If the speech had been fully reported it would be\r\na contribution of infinite value to students of the social history\r\nof eighteenth-century England, for we are told that ‘he proceeded\r\nto examine, paragraph by paragraph, every provision of the Bill,\r\nanimadverting and pointing out some acts of injustice, partiality,\r\nobscurity or cause of confusion in each.’[57] Unfortunately this part\r\nof his speech was omitted in the report as being ‘irrelative to the\r\ndebate,’ which was concerned with the question of the propriety of\r\ncommuting tithes. But the report, incomplete as it is, contains an\r\nilluminating passage on the conduct of Private Bill Committees. ‘His\r\nLordship ... next turned his attention to the mode in which private\r\nbills were permitted to make their way through both Houses, and that in\r\nmatters in which property was concerned, to the great injury of many,\r\nif not the total ruin of some private families: many proofs of this\r\nevil had come to his knowledge as a member of the other House, not a\r\nfew in his professional character, before he had the honour of a seat\r\nin that House, nor had he been a total stranger to such evils since he\r\nwas called upon to preside in another place.’ Going on to speak of the\r\ncommittees of the House of Commons and ‘the rapidity with which private\r\nBills were hurried through,’ he declared that ‘it was not unfrequent\r\nto decide upon the merits of a Bill which would affect the property\r\nand interests of persons inhabiting a district of several miles in\r\nextent, in less time than it took him to determine upon the propriety\r\nof issuing an order for a few pounds, by which no man’s property\r\ncould be injured.’ He concluded by telling the House of Lords a story\r\nof how Sir George Savile once noticed a man ‘rather meanly habited’\r\nwatching the proceedings of a committee with anxious interest. When the\r\ncommittee had agreed on its report, the agitated spectator was seen to\r\nbe in great distress. Sir George Savile asked him what was the matter,\r\nand he found that the man would be ruined by a clause that had been\r\npassed by the committee, and that, having heard that the Bill was to be\r\nintroduced, he had made his way to London on foot, too poor to come in\r\nany other way or to fee counsel. Savile then made inquiries and learnt\r\nthat these statements were correct, whereupon he secured the amendment\r\nof the Bill, ‘by which means an innocent, indigent man and his family\r\nwere rescued from destruction.’ It would not have been very easy for a\r\n‘meanly habited man’ to make the journey to London from Wakefield or\r\nKnaresborough or Haute Huntre, even if he knew when a Bill was coming\r\non, and to stay in London until it went into committee; and if he did,\r\nhe would not always be so lucky as to find a Sir George Savile on the\r\ncommittee--the public man who was regarded by his contemporaries, to\r\nwhatever party they belonged, as the Bayard of politics.[58]\r\n\r\nWe get very few glimpses into the underworld of the common and obscure\r\npeople, whose homes and fortunes trembled on the chance that a quarrel\r\nover tithes and the conflicting claims of squire and parson might\r\ndisturb the unanimity of a score of gentlemen sitting round a table.\r\nLondon was far away, and the Olympian peace of Parliament was rarely\r\nbroken by the protests of its victims. But we get one such glimpse in a\r\npassage in the _Annual Register_ for 1767.\r\n\r\n‘On Tuesday evening a great number of farmers were observed going along\r\nPall Mall with cockades in their hats. On enquiring the reason, it\r\nappeared they all lived in or near the parish of Stanwell in the county\r\nof Middlesex, and they were returning to their wives and families to\r\ncarry them the agreeable news of a Bill being rejected for inclosing\r\nthe said common, which if carried into execution, might have been the\r\nruin of a great number of families.’[59]\r\n\r\nWhen the Committee on the Enclosure Bill had reported to the House of\r\nCommons, the rest of the proceedings were generally formal. The Bill\r\nwas read a third time, engrossed, sent up to the Lords, where petitions\r\nmight be presented as in the Commons, and received the Royal Assent.\r\n\r\nA study of the pages of Hansard and Debrett tells us little about\r\ntransactions that fill the _Journals_ of the Houses of Parliament.\r\nThree debates in the House of Lords are fully reported,[60] and they\r\nillustrate the play of forces at Westminster. The Bishop of St.\r\nDavids[61] moved to recommit an Enclosure Bill in 1781 on the ground\r\nthat, like many other Enclosure Bills, it provided for the commutation\r\nof tithes--an arrangement which he thought open to many objections.\r\nHere was an issue that was vital, for it concerned the interests of\r\nthe classes represented in Parliament. Did the Church stand to gain or\r\nto lose by taking land instead of tithe? Was it a bad thing or a good\r\nthing that the parson should be put into the position of a farmer, that\r\nhe should be under the temptation to enter into an arrangement with\r\nthe landlord which might prejudice his successor, that he should be\r\nrelieved from a system which often caused bad blood between him and his\r\nparishioners? Would it ‘make him neglect the sacred functions of his\r\nministry’ as the Bishop of St. Davids feared, or would it improve his\r\nusefulness by rescuing him from a situation in which ‘the pastor was\r\ntotally sunk in the tithe-collector’ as the Bishop of Peterborough[62]\r\nhoped, and was a man a better parson on the Sunday for being a farmer\r\nthe rest of the week as Lord Coventry believed? The bishops and the\r\npeers had in this discussion a subject that touched very nearly the\r\nlives and interests of themselves and their friends, and there was a\r\nconsiderable and animated debate,[63] at the end of which the House of\r\nLords approved the principle of commuting tithes in Enclosure Bills.\r\nThis debate was followed by another on 6th April, when Lord Bathurst\r\n(President of the Council) as a counterblast to his colleague on the\r\nWoolsack, moved, but afterwards withdrew, a series of resolutions on\r\nthe same subject. In the course of this debate Thurlow, who thought\r\nperhaps that his zeal for the Church had surprised and irritated\r\nhis fellow-peers, among whom he was not conspicuous in life as a\r\npractising Christian, explained that though he was zealous for the\r\nChurch, ‘his zeal was not partial or confined to the Church, further\r\nthan it was connected with the other great national establishments,\r\nof which it formed a part, and no inconsiderable one.’ The Bishop\r\nof St. Davids returned to the subject on the 14th June, moving to\r\nrecommit the Bill for enclosing Kington in Worcestershire. He read a\r\nstring of resolutions which he wished to see applied to all future\r\nEnclosure Bills, in order to defend the interests of the clergy from\r\n‘the oppressions of the Lord of the Manor, landowners, etc.’ Thurlow\r\nspoke for him, but he was defeated by 24 votes to 4, his only other\r\nsupporters being Lord Galloway and the Bishop of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThurlow’s story of Sir George Savile’s ‘meanly habited man’ did not\r\ndisturb the confidence of the House of Lords in the justice of the\r\nexisting procedure towards the poor: the enclosure debates revolve\r\nsolely round the question of the relative claims of the lord of the\r\nmanor and the tithe-owner. The House of Commons was equally free\r\nfrom scruple or misgiving. One petitioner in 1800 commented on the\r\nextraordinary haste with which a New Forest Bill was pushed through\r\nParliament, and suggested that if it were passed into law in this rapid\r\nmanner at the end of a session, some injustice might unconsciously be\r\ndone. The Speaker replied with a grave and dignified rebuke: ‘The House\r\nwas always competent to give every subject the consideration due to its\r\nimportance, and could not therefore be truly said to be incapable at\r\nany time of discussing any question gravely, dispassionately, and with\r\nstrict regard to justice.’[64] He recommended that the petition should\r\nbe passed over as if it had never been presented. The member who had\r\npresented the petition pleaded that he had not read it. Such were the\r\nplausibilities and decorum in which the House of Commons wrapped up\r\nits abuses. We can imagine that some of the members must have smiled\r\nto each other like the Roman augurs, when they exchanged these solemn\r\nhypocrisies.\r\n\r\nWe have a sidelight on the vigilance of the House of Commons, when an\r\nEnclosure Bill came down from a committee, in a speech of Windham’s\r\nin defence of bull-baiting. Windham attacked the politicians who\r\nhad introduced the Bill to abolish bull-baiting, for raising such a\r\nquestion at a time of national crisis when Parliament ought to be\r\nthinking of other things. He then went on to compare the subject to\r\nlocal subjects that ‘contained nothing of public or general interest.\r\nTo procure the discussion of such subjects it was necessary to resort\r\nto canvass and intrigue. Members whose attendance was induced by\r\nlocal considerations in most cases of this description, were present:\r\nthe discussion, if any took place, was managed by the friends of\r\nthe measure: and the decision of the House was ultimately, perhaps,\r\na matter of mere chance.’ From Sheridan’s speech in answer, we\r\nlearn that this is a description of the passing of Enclosure Bills.\r\n‘Another honourable gentleman who had opposed this Bill with peculiar\r\nvehemence, considered it as one of those light and trivial subjects,\r\nwhich was not worthy to occupy the deliberations of Parliament: and\r\nhe compared it to certain other subjects of Bills: that is to say,\r\nbills of a local nature, respecting inclosures and other disposal of\r\nproperty, which merely passed by chance, as Members could not be got\r\nto attend their progress by dint of canvassing.’[65] Doubtless most\r\nMembers of the House of Commons shared the sentiments of Lord Sandwich,\r\nwho told the House of Lords that he was so satisfied ‘that the more\r\ninclosures the better, that as far as his poor abilities would enable\r\nhim, he would support every inclosure bill that should be brought into\r\nthe House.’[66]\r\n\r\nFor the last act of an enclosure drama the scene shifts back to the\r\nparish. The commissioners arrive, receive and determine claims,\r\nand publish an award, mapping out the new village. The life and\r\nbusiness of the village are now in suspense, and the commissioners\r\nare often authorised to prescribe the course of husbandry during the\r\ntransition.[67] The Act which they administer provides that a certain\r\nproportion of the land is to be assigned to the lord of the manor, in\r\nvirtue of his rights, and a certain proportion to the owner of the\r\ntithes. An occasional Act provides that some small allotment shall be\r\nmade to the poor: otherwise the commissioners have a free hand: their\r\npowers are virtually absolute. This is the impression left by all\r\ncontemporary writers. Arthur Young, for example, writes emphatically\r\nin this sense. ‘Thus is the property of proprietors, and especially of\r\nthe poor ones, entirely at their mercy: every passion of resentment\r\nand prejudice may be gratified without control, for they are vested\r\nwith a despotic power known in no other branch of business in this\r\nfree country.’[68] Similar testimony is found in the Report of the\r\nSelect Committee (1800) on the Expense and Mode of Obtaining Bills of\r\nEnclosure: ‘the expediency of despatch, without the additional expense\r\nof multiplied litigation, has suggested the necessity of investing them\r\nwith a summary, and in most cases uncontrollable jurisdiction.’[69] In\r\nthe General Report of the Board of Agriculture on Enclosures, published\r\nin 1808, though any more careful procedure is deprecated as likely to\r\ncause delay, it is stated that the adjusting of property worth £50,000\r\nwas left to the arbitration of a majority of five, ‘often persons\r\nof mean education.’ The author of _An Inquiry into the Advantages\r\nand Disadvantages resulting from Bills of Inclosure_, published in\r\n1781, writes as if it was the practice to allow an appeal to Quarter\r\nSessions; such an appeal he characterised as useless to a poor man,\r\nand we can well believe that most of the squires who sat on such a\r\ntribunal to punish vagrants or poachers had had a hand in an enclosure\r\nin the past or had their eyes on an enclosure in the future. Thurlow\r\nconsidered such an appeal quite inadequate, giving the more polite\r\nreason that Quarter Sessions had not the necessary time.[70] The Act\r\nof 1801 is silent on the subject, but Sinclair’s draft of a General\r\nInclosure Bill, published in the _Annals of Agriculture_ in 1796,[71]\r\nprovided for an appeal to Quarter Sessions. It will be seen that in\r\nfive of the cases analysed in the Appendix (Haute Huntre, Simpson,\r\nStanwell, Wakefield and Winfrith Newburgh), the decision of the\r\ncommissioners on claims was final, except that at Wakefield an objector\r\nmight oblige the commissioners to take the opinion of a counsel chosen\r\nby themselves. In five cases (Ashelworth, Croydon, Cheshunt, Laleham\r\nand Louth), a disappointed claimant might bring a suit on a feigned\r\nissue against a proprietor. At Armley and Knaresborough the final\r\ndecision was left to arbitrators, but whereas at Armley the arbitrator\r\nwas to be chosen by a neutral authority, the Recorder of Leeds, the\r\narbitrators at Knaresborough were named in the Act, and were presumably\r\nas much the nominees of the promoters as the commissioners themselves.\r\n\r\nThe statements of contemporaries already quoted go to show that none\r\nof these arrangements were regarded as seriously fettering the power\r\nof the commissioners, and it is easy to understand that a lawsuit,\r\nwhich might of course overwhelm him, was not a remedy for the use of a\r\nsmall proprietor or a cottager, though it might be of some advantage\r\nto a large proprietor who had not been fortunate enough to secure\r\nadequate representation of his interests on the Board of Commissioners.\r\nBut the decision as to claims was only part of the business. A man’s\r\nclaim might be allowed, and yet gross injustice might be done him in\r\nthe redistribution. He might be given inferior land, or land in an\r\ninconvenient position. In ten of the cases in the Appendix the award\r\nof the commissioners is stated to be final, and there is no appeal from\r\nit. The two exceptions are Knaresborough and Armley. The Knaresborough\r\nAct is silent on the point, and the Armley Act allows an appeal to the\r\nRecorder of Leeds. So far therefore as the claims and allotments of\r\nthe poor were concerned, the commissioners were in no danger of being\r\noverruled. Their freedom in other ways was restricted by the Standing\r\nOrders of 1774, which obliged them to give an account of their expenses.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to be obvious that any society which had an elementary\r\nnotion of the meaning and importance of justice would have taken the\r\nutmost pains to see that the men appointed to this extraordinary office\r\nhad no motive for showing partiality. This might not unreasonably\r\nhave been expected of the society about which Pitt declared in the\r\nHouse of Commons, that it was the boast of the law of England that\r\nit afforded equal security and protection to the high and low, the\r\nrich and poor.[72] How were these commissioners appointed at the time\r\nthat Pitt was Prime Minister? They were appointed in each case before\r\nthe Bill was presented to Parliament, and generally, as Young tells\r\nus, they were appointed by the promoters of the enclosure before the\r\npetition was submitted for local signatures, so that in fact they\r\nwere nominated by the persons of influence who agreed on the measure.\r\nIn one case (Moreton Corbet in Shropshire; 1950 acres enclosed in\r\n1797) the Act appointed one commissioner only, and he was to name\r\nhis successor. Sometimes, as in the case of Otmoor,[73] it might\r\nhappen that the commissioners were changed while the Bill was passing\r\nthrough Committee, if some powerful persons were able to secure better\r\nrepresentation of their own interests. In the case of Wakefield again,\r\nthe House of Commons Committee placated Lord Strafford by giving him a\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nNow, who was supposed to have a voice in the appointment of the\r\ncommissioners? There is to be found in the _Annals of Agriculture_[74]\r\nan extremely interesting paper by Sir John Sinclair, preliminary\r\nto a memorandum of the General Enclosure Bill which he promoted in\r\n1796. Sinclair explains that he had had eighteen hundred Enclosure\r\nActs (taken indiscriminately) examined in order to ascertain what\r\nwas the usual procedure and what stipulations were made with regard\r\nto particular interests; this with the intention of incorporating\r\nthe recognised practice in his General Bill. In the course of these\r\nremarks he says, ‘the probable result will be the appointment of one\r\nCommissioner by the Lord of the Manor, of another by the tithe-owner,\r\nand of a third by the major part in value of the proprietors.’[75] It\r\nwill be observed that the third commissioner is not appointed by a\r\nmajority of the commoners, nor even by the majority of the proprietors,\r\nbut by the votes of those who own the greater part of the village. This\r\nenables us to assess the value of what might have seemed a safeguard\r\nto the poor--the provision that the names of the commissioners should\r\nappear in the Bill presented to Parliament. The lord of the manor, the\r\nimpropriator of tithes, and the majority in value of the owners are a\r\nsmall minority of the persons affected by an enclosure, and all that\r\nthey have to do is to meet round a table and name the commissioners\r\nwho are to represent them.[76] Thus we find that the powerful persons\r\nwho carried an enclosure against the will of the poor nominated the\r\ntribunal before which the poor had to make good their several claims.\r\nThis was the way in which the constitution that Pitt was defending\r\nafforded equal security and protection to the rich and to the poor.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed further that two interests are chosen out for\r\nspecial representation. They are the lord of the manor and the\r\nimpropriator of tithes: in other words, the very persons who are\r\nformally assigned a certain minimum in the distribution by the Act\r\nof Parliament. Every Act after 1774 declares that the lord of the\r\nmanor is to have a certain proportion, and the tithe-owner a certain\r\nproportion of the land divided: scarcely any Act stipulates that any\r\nshare at all is to go to the cottager or the small proprietor. Yet in\r\nthe appointment of commissioners the interests that are protected by\r\nthe Act have a preponderating voice, and the interests that are left\r\nto the caprice of the commissioners have no voice at all. Thurlow,\r\nspeaking in the House of Lords in 1781,[77] said that it was grossly\r\nunjust to the parson that his property should be at the disposal of\r\nthese commissioners, of whom he only nominated one. ‘He thanked God\r\nthat the property of an Englishman depended not on so loose a tribunal\r\nin any other instance whatever.’ What, then, was the position of the\r\npoor and the small farmers who were not represented at all among the\r\ncommissioners? In the paper already quoted, Sinclair mentions that\r\nin some cases the commissioners were peers, gentlemen and clergymen,\r\nresiding in the neighbourhood, who acted without fees or emolument. He\r\nspoke of this as undertaking a useful duty, and it does not seem to\r\nhave occurred to him that there was any objection to such a practice.\r\n‘To lay down the principle that men are to serve for nothing,’ said\r\nCobbett, in criticising the system of unpaid magistrates, ‘puts me in\r\nmind of the servant who went on hire, who being asked what wages he\r\ndemanded, said he wanted no wages: for that he always found about the\r\nhouse little things to pick up.’\r\n\r\nThere is a curious passage in the General Report of the Board of\r\nAgriculture[78] on the subject of the appointment of commissioners. The\r\nwriter, after dwelling on the unexampled powers that the commissioners\r\nenjoy, remarks that they are not likely to be abused, because a\r\ncommissioner’s prospect of future employment in this profitable\r\ncapacity depends on his character for integrity and justice. This is\r\na reassuring reflection for the classes that promoted enclosures and\r\nappointed commissioners, but it rings with a very different sound in\r\nother ears. It would clearly have been much better for the poor if the\r\ncommissioners had not had any prospect of future employment at all. We\r\ncan obtain some idea of the kind of men whom the landowners considered\r\nto be competent and satisfactory commissioners from the Standing Orders\r\nof 1801, which forbade the employment in this capacity of the bailiff\r\nof the lord of the manor. It would be interesting to know how much of\r\nEngland was appropriated on the initiative of the lord of the manor, by\r\nhis bailiff, acting under the authority given to him by the High Court\r\nof Parliament. It is significant, too, that down to 1801 a commissioner\r\nwas only debarred from buying land in a parish in which he had acted in\r\nthis capacity, until his award was made. The Act of 1801 debarred him\r\nfrom buying land under such circumstances for the following five years.\r\n\r\nThe share of the small man in these transactions from first to last\r\ncan be estimated from the language of Arthur Young in 1770. ‘The small\r\nproprietor whose property in the township is perhaps his all, has\r\nlittle or no weight in regulating the clauses of the Act of Parliament,\r\nhas seldom, if ever, an opportunity of putting a single one in the Bill\r\nfavourable to his rights, and has as little influence in the choice of\r\nCommissioners.’[79] But even this description does less than justice\r\nto his helplessness. There remains to be considered the procedure\r\nbefore the commissioners themselves. Most Enclosure Acts specified a\r\ndate before which all claims had to be presented. It is obvious that\r\nthere must have been very many small proprietors who had neither the\r\ncourage nor the knowledge necessary to put and defend their case, and\r\nthat vast numbers of claims must have been disregarded because they\r\nwere not presented, or because they were presented too late, or because\r\nthey were irregular in form. The Croydon Act, for example, prescribes\r\nthat claimants must send in their claims ‘in Writing under their Hands,\r\nor the Hands of their Agents, distinguishing in such Claims the Tenure\r\nof the Estates in respect whereof such Claims are made, and stating\r\ntherein such further Particulars as shall be necessary to describe\r\nsuch Claims with Precision.’ And if this was a difficult fence for the\r\nsmall proprietor, unaccustomed to legal forms and documents, or to\r\nforms and documents of any kind, what was the plight of the cottager?\r\nLet us imagine the cottager, unable to read or write, enjoying certain\r\ncustomary rights of common without any idea of their origin or history\r\nor legal basis: knowing only that as long as he can remember he has\r\nkept a cow, driven geese across the waste, pulled his fuel out of the\r\nneighbouring brushwood, and cut turf from the common, and that his\r\nfather did all these things before him. The cottager learns that before\r\na certain day he has to present to his landlord’s bailiff, or to the\r\nparson, or to one of the magistrates into whose hands perhaps he has\r\nfallen before now over a little matter of a hare or a partridge, or to\r\nsome solicitor from the country town, a clear and correct statement\r\nof his rights and his claim to a share in the award. Let us remember\r\nat the same time all that we know from Fielding and Smollett of the\r\nreputation of lawyers for cruelty to the poor. Is a cottager to be\r\ntrusted to face the ordeal, or to be in time with his statement, or to\r\nhave that statement in proper legal form? The commissioners can reject\r\nhis claim on the ground of any technical irregularity, as we learn\r\nfrom a petition presented to Parliament in 1774 by several persons\r\ninterested in the enclosure of Knaresborough Forest, whose claims\r\nhad been disallowed by the commissioners because of certain ‘mistakes\r\nmade in the description of such tenements ... notwithstanding the said\r\nerrors were merely from inadvertency, and in no way altered the merits\r\nof the petitioners’ claims.’ A Bill was before Parliament to amend\r\nthe previous Act for enclosing Knaresborough Forest, in respect of\r\nthe method of payment of expenses, and hence these petitioners had an\r\nopportunity of making their treatment public.[80] It is easy to guess\r\nwhat was the fate of many a small proprietor or cottager, who had to\r\ndescribe his tenement or common right to an unsympathetic tribunal.\r\nWe are not surprised that one of the witnesses told the Enclosure\r\nCommittee of 1844 that the poor often did not know what their claims\r\nwere, or how to present them. It is significant that in the case of\r\nSedgmoor, out of 4063 claims sent in, only 1798 were allowed.[81]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now given an account of the procedure by which Parliamentary\r\nenclosures were carried out. We give elsewhere a detailed analysis,\r\ndisentangled from the _Journals_ of Parliament and other sources, of\r\nparticular enclosures. We propose to give here two illustrations of the\r\ntemper of the Parliamentary Committees. One illustration is provided by\r\na speech made by Sir William Meredith, one of the Rockingham Whigs, in\r\n1772, a speech that needs no comment. ‘Sir William Meredith moved, That\r\nit might be a general order, that no Bill, or clause in a Bill, making\r\nany offence capital, should be agreed to but in a Committee of the\r\nwhole House. He observed, that at present the facility of passing such\r\nclauses was shameful: that he once passing a Committee-room, when only\r\none Member was holding a Committee, with a clerk’s boy, he happened\r\nto hear something of hanging; he immediately had the curiosity to ask\r\nwhat was going forward in that small Committee that could merit such a\r\npunishment? He was answered, that it was an Inclosing Bill, in which\r\na great many poor people were concerned, who opposed the Bill; that\r\nthey feared those people would obstruct the execution of the Act, and\r\ntherefore this clause was to make it capital felony in anyone who did\r\nso. This resolution was unanimously agreed to.’[82]\r\n\r\nThe other illustration is provided by the history of an attempted\r\nenclosure in which we can watch the minds of the chief actors without\r\nscreen or disguise of any kind: in this case we have very fortunately a\r\nvivid revelation of the spirit and manner in which Committees conducted\r\ntheir business, from the pen of the chairman himself. George Selwyn\r\ngives us in his letters, published in the _Carlisle Papers_, a view\r\nof the proceedings from the inside. It is worth while to set out in\r\nsome detail the passages from these letters published in the _Carlisle\r\nPapers_, by way of supplementing and explaining the official records of\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the _Journals_ of the House of Commons that, on 10th\r\nNovember, 1775, a petition was presented to the House of Commons\r\nfor the enclosure of King’s Sedgmoor, in the County of Somerset,\r\nthe petitioners urging that this land was of very little value in\r\nits present state, and that it was capable of great improvement by\r\nenclosure and drainage. Leave was given to bring in a Bill, to be\r\nprepared by Mr. St. John and Mr. Coxe. Mr. St. John was brother of\r\nLord Bolingbroke. On 13th November, the Bill was presented and read\r\na first time. Four days later it received a second reading, and was\r\nsent to a Committee of Mr. St. John and others. At this point, those\r\nwho objected to the enclosure began to take action. First of all there\r\nis a petition from William Waller, Esq., who says that under a grant\r\nof Charles I. he is entitled to the soil of the moor: it is agreed\r\nthat he shall be heard by counsel before the Committee. The next day\r\nthere arrives a petition from owners and occupiers in thirty-five\r\n‘parishes, hamlets and places,’ who state that all these parishes have\r\nenjoyed rights of common without discrimination over the 18,000 acres\r\nof pasture on Sedgmoor: that these rights of pasture and cutting turf\r\nand rushes and sedges have existed from time immemorial, and that no\r\nEnclosure Act is wanted for the draining of Sedgmoor, because an Act of\r\nthe reign of William III. had conferred all the necessary powers for\r\nthis purpose on the Justices of the Peace. The petitioners prayed to be\r\nheard by themselves and counsel against the application for enclosure\r\non Committee and on Report. The House of Commons ordered that the\r\npetition should lie on the Table, and that the petitioners should be\r\nheard when the Report had been received from Committee. Five days later\r\nthree lords of manors (Sir Charles Kemys Tynte, Baronet, Copleston\r\nWarre Bampfylde, Esq., and William Hawker, Esq.) petition against the\r\nBill and complain of the haste with which the promoters are pushing\r\nthe Bill through Parliament. This petition is taken more seriously: a\r\nmotion is made and defeated to defer the Bill for two months, but the\r\nHouse orders that the petitioners shall be heard before the Committee.\r\nTwo of these three lords of manor present a further petition early in\r\nDecember, stating that they and their tenants are more than a majority\r\nin number and value of the persons interested, and a second petition\r\nis also presented by the thirty-seven parishes and hamlets already\r\nmentioned, in which it is contended that, in spite of the difficulties\r\nof collecting signatures in a scattered district in a very short time,\r\n749 persons interested had already signed the petition against the\r\nBill, that the effect of the Bill had been misrepresented to many of\r\nthe tenants, that the facts as to the different interests affected had\r\nbeen misrepresented to the Committee, that the number and rights of\r\nthe persons supporting the Bill had been exaggerated (only 213 having\r\nsigned their names as consenting), and that if justice was to be done\r\nto the various parties concerned, it was essential that time should be\r\ngiven for the hearing of complaints and the circulation of the Bill in\r\nthe district. This petition was presented on 11th December, and the\r\nHouse of Commons ordered that the petitioners should be heard when the\r\nReport was received. Next day Mr. Selwyn, as Chairman of the Committee,\r\npresented a Report in favour of the Bill, mentioning among other things\r\nthat the number of tenements concerned was 1269, and that 303 refused\r\nto sign; but attention was drawn to the fact that there were several\r\nvariations between the Bill as it was presented to the House, and the\r\nBill as it was presented to the parties concerned for their consent,\r\nand on this ground the Bill was defeated by 59 to 35 votes.\r\n\r\nThis is the cold impersonal account of the proceedings given in the\r\nofficial journals, but the letters of Selwyn take us behind the scenes\r\nand supply a far livelier picture.[83] His account begins with a letter\r\nto Lord Carlisle in November:\r\n\r\n ‘Bully has a scheme of enclosure, which, if it succeeds, I am told\r\n will free him from all his difficulties. It is to come into our House\r\n immediately. If I had this from a better judgment than that of our\r\n sanguine counsellors, I should have more hopes from it. I am ready to\r\n allow that he has been very faulty, but I cannot help wishing to see\r\n him once more on his legs....’\r\n\r\n(Bully, of course, is Bolingbroke, brother of St. John, called the\r\ncounsellor, author of the Bill.) We learn from this letter that there\r\nare other motives than a passion to drain Sedgmoor in the promotion of\r\nthis great improvement scheme. We learn from the next letter that it is\r\nnot only Bully’s friends and creditors who have some reason for wishing\r\nit well:\r\n\r\n ‘Stavordale is returning to Redlinch; I believe that he sets out\r\n to-morrow. He is also deeply engaged in this Sedgmoor Bill, and it\r\n is supposed that he or Lord Ilchester, which you please, will get\r\n 2000_l._ a year by it. He will get more, or save more at least, by\r\n going away and leaving the Moor in my hands, for he told me himself\r\n the other night that this last trip to town had cost him 4000_l._’\r\n\r\nAnother letter warns Lord Carlisle that the only way to get his\r\ncreditors to pay their debts to him, when they come into their money\r\nthrough the enclosure, is to press for payment, and goes on to describe\r\nthe unexpected opposition the Bill had encountered. Selwyn had been\r\nmade chairman of the Committee.\r\n\r\n ‘... My dear Lord, if your delicacy is such that you will not be\r\n pressing with him about it, you may be assured that you will never\r\n receive a farthing. I have spoke to Hare about it, who [was] kept\r\n in it till half an hour after 4; as I was also to-day, and shall be\r\n to-morrow. I thought that it was a matter of form only, but had no\r\n sooner begun to read the preamble to the Bill, but I found myself in a\r\n nest of hornets. The room was full, and an opposition made to it, and\r\n disputes upon every word, which kept me in the Chair, as I have told\r\n you. I have gained it seems great reputation, and am at this minute\r\n reputed one of the best Chairmen upon this stand. Bully and Harry came\r\n home and dined with me....’\r\n\r\nThe next letter, written on 9th December, shows that Selwyn is afraid\r\nthat Stavordale may not get his money out of his father, and also that\r\nhe is becoming still more anxious about the fate of the Enclosure Bill,\r\non which of course the whole pack of cards depends:\r\n\r\n ‘... I have taken the liberty to talk a good deal to Lord Stavordale,\r\n partly for his own sake and partly for yours, and pressed him much to\r\n get out of town as soon as possible, and not quit Lord I. [Ilchester]\r\n any more. His attention there cannot be of long duration, and his\r\n absence may be fatal to us all. I painted it in very strong colours,\r\n and he has promised me to go, as soon as this Sedgmoor Bill is\r\n reported. I moved to have Tuesday fixed for it. We had a debate and\r\n division upon my motion, and this Bill will at last not go down so\r\n glibly as Bully hoped that it would. It will meet with more opposition\r\n in the H. of Lords, and Lord North being adverse to it, does us no\r\n good. Lord Ilchester gets, it is said, £5000 a year by it, and amongst\r\n others Sir C. Tynte something, who, for what reason I cannot yet\r\n comprehend, opposes it....’\r\n\r\nThe next letter describes the final catastrophe:\r\n\r\n ‘December 12. Tuesday night.... Bully has lost his Bill. I reported\r\n it to-day, and the Question was to withdraw it. There were 59 against\r\n us, and we were 35. It was worse managed by the agents, supposing no\r\n treachery, than ever business was. Lord North, Robinson, and Keene\r\n divided against. Charles[84] said all that could be said on our side.\r\n But as the business was managed, it was the worst Question that I\r\n ever voted for. We were a Committee absolutely of Almack’s,[85] so\r\n if the Bill is not resumed, and better conducted and supported, this\r\n phantom of 30,000_l._ clear in Bully’s pocket to pay off his annuities\r\n vanishes.\r\n\r\n ‘It is surprising what a fatality attends some people’s proceedings.\r\n I begged last night as for alms, that they would meet me to settle\r\n the Votes. I have, since I have been in Parliament, been of twenty\r\n at least of these meetings, and always brought numbers down by those\r\n means. But my advice was slighted, and twenty people were walking\r\n about the streets who could have carried this point.\r\n\r\n ‘The cause was not bad, but the Question was totally indigestible.\r\n The most conscientious man in the House in Questions of this nature,\r\n Sir F. Drake, a very old acquaintance of mine, told me that nothing\r\n could be so right as the enclosure. But they sent one Bill into\r\n the country for the assent of the people interested, and brought\r\n me another, differing in twenty particulars, to carry through the\r\n Committee, without once mentioning to me that the two Bills differed.\r\n This they thought was cunning, and I believe a happy composition of\r\n Bully’s cunning and John’s idea of his own parts. I had no idea, or\r\n could have, of this difference. The adverse party said nothing of it,\r\n _comme de raison_, reserving the objection till the Report, and it\r\n was insurmountable. If one of the Clerks only had hinted it to me,\r\n inexperienced as I am in these sort of Bills, I would have stopped it,\r\n and by that means have given them a better chance by a new Bill than\r\n they can have now, that people will have a pretence for not altering\r\n their opinion....’\r\n\r\nThese letters compensate for the silence of Hansard, so real and\r\ninstructive a picture do they present of the methods and motives of\r\nenclosure. ‘Bully has a scheme of enclosure which, if it succeeds, I\r\nam told will free him from all his difficulties.’ The journals may talk\r\nof the undrained fertility of Sedgmoor, but we have in this sentence\r\nthe aspect of the enclosure that interests Selwyn, the Chairman of\r\nthe Committee, and from beginning to end of the proceedings no other\r\naspect ever enters his head. And it interests a great many other people\r\nbesides Selwyn, for Bully owes money; so too does Stavordale, another\r\nprospective beneficiary: he owes money to Fox, and Fox owes money to\r\nCarlisle. Now Bully and Stavordale are not the only eighteenth-century\r\naristocrats who are in difficulties; the waiters at Brooks’s and at\r\nWhite’s know that well enough, as Selwyn felt when, on hearing that\r\none of them had been arrested for felony, he exclaimed, ‘What an idea\r\nof us he will give in Newgate.’ Nor is Bully the only aristocrat in\r\ndifficulties whose thoughts turn to enclosure; Selwyn’s letters alone,\r\nwith their reference to previous successes, would make that clear. It\r\nis here that we begin to appreciate the effect of our system of family\r\nsettlements in keeping the aristocracy together. These young men, whose\r\nfortunes come and go in the hurricanes of the faro table, would soon\r\nhave dissipated their estates if they had been free to do it; as they\r\nwere restrained by settlements, they could only mortgage them. But\r\nthere is a limit to this process, and after a time their debts begin\r\nto overwhelm them; perhaps also too many of their fellow gamblers are\r\ntheir creditors to make Brooks’s or White’s quite as comfortable a\r\nplace as it used to be, for we may doubt whether all of these creditors\r\nwere troubled with Lord Carlisle’s morbid delicacy of feeling. Happily\r\nthere is an escape from this painful situation: a scheme of enclosure\r\nwhich will put him ‘once more on his legs.’ The other parties concerned\r\nare generally poor men, and there is not much danger of failure. Thus\r\nif we trace the adventures of the gaming table to their bitter end, we\r\nbegin to understand that these wild revellers are gambling not with\r\ntheir own estates but with the estates of their neighbours. This is the\r\nonly property they can realise. _Quidquid delirant reges plectuntur\r\nAchivi._\r\n\r\nThe particular obstacle on which the scheme split was a fraudulent\r\nirregularity: the Bill submitted for signature to the inhabitants\r\ndiffering seriously (in twenty particulars) from the Bill presented\r\nto Parliament. Selwyn clearly attached no importance at all to the\r\nPetitions that were received against the Bill, or to the evidence of\r\nits local unpopularity. It is clear too, that it was very rare for a\r\nscheme like this to miscarry, for, speaking of his becoming Chairman\r\nof the Committee, he adds, ‘I thought it was a matter of form only.’\r\nFurther with a little care this project would have weathered the\r\ndiscovery of the fraud of which the authors were guilty. ‘I begged\r\nlast night as for alms that they would meet us to settle the Votes.\r\nI have, since I have been in Parliament, been of twenty at least of\r\nthese meetings, and always brought numbers down by these means. But my\r\nadvice was slighted, and twenty people were walking about the streets\r\nwho could have carried this point.’ In other words, the Bill would\r\nhave been carried, all its iniquities notwithstanding, if only Bully’s\r\nfriends had taken Selwyn’s advice and put themselves out to go down\r\nto Westminster. So little impression did this piece of trickery make\r\non the mind of the Chairman of the Committee, that he intended to the\r\nlast, by collecting his friends, to carry the Bill, for the fairness\r\nand good order of which he was responsible, through the House of\r\nCommons. This glimpse into the operations of the Committee enables us\r\nto picture the groups of comrades who sauntered down from Almack’s of\r\nan afternoon to carve up a manor in Committee of the House of Commons.\r\nWe can see Bully’s friends meeting round the table in their solemn\r\ncharacter of judges and legislators, to give a score of villages to\r\nBully, and a dozen to Stavordale, much as Artaxerxes gave Magnesia to\r\nThemistocles for his bread, Myus for his meat and Lampsacus for his\r\nwine. And if those friends happened to be Bully’s creditors as well,\r\nit would perhaps not be unjust to suppose that their action was not\r\naltogether free from the kind of gratitude that inspired the bounty of\r\nthe great king.[86]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] _E.g._ Laxton enclosed on petition of Lord Carbery in 1772.

The affair has\r\nbecome famous on account of the actors, and because it was the turning\r\npoint in a very important career. The cause of the quarrel has passed\r\ninto the background, but students of the enclosure movement will find\r\nmore to interest them in its beginning than in its circumstances and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nMr. De Grey, Member for Norfolk, and Lord of the Manor of Tollington\r\nin that county, had a dispute of long standing with Mr. William Tooke\r\nof Purley, a landowner in Tollington, who had resisted Mr. De Grey’s\r\nencroachments on the common. An action on this subject was impending,\r\nbut Mr. De Grey, who held, as Sir George Trevelyan puts it, ‘that the\r\nlaw’s delay was not intended for Members of Parliament’ got another\r\nMember of Parliament to introduce a petition for a Bill for the\r\nenclosure of Tollington. As it happened, Mr. Tooke was a friend of one\r\nof the clerks in the House of Commons, and this friend told him on\r\n6th January that a petition from De Grey was about to be presented. A\r\nfortnight later Mr. Tooke received from this clerk a copy of Mr. De\r\nGrey’s petition, in which the Lord Chief Justice, brother of Mr. De\r\nGrey was included. Mr. Tooke hurried to London and prepared a counter\r\npetition, and Sir Edward Astley, the member for the constituency,\r\nundertook to present that petition together with the petition from Mr.\r\nDe Grey. There were some further negotiations, with the result that\r\nboth sides revised their respective petitions, and it was arranged that\r\nthey should be presented on 4th February. On that day the Speaker said\r\nthe House was not full enough, and the petitions must be presented on\r\nthe 7th. Accordingly Sir Edward Astley brought up both petitions on\r\nthe 7th, but the Speaker said it was very extraordinary to present two\r\ncontrary petitions at the same time. ‘Bring the first petition first.’\r\nWhen members began to say ‘Hear, hear,’ the Speaker remarked, ‘It is\r\nonly a common petition for a common enclosure,’ and the Members fell\r\ninto general conversation, paying no heed to the proceedings at the\r\nTable. In the midst of this the petition was read, and the Speaker\r\nasked for ‘Ayes and Noes,’ and declared that the Ayes had it. The\r\npetition asking for the Bill had thus been surreptitiously carried\r\nwithout the House being made aware that there was a contrary petition\r\nto be presented, the contrary petition asking for delay. The second\r\npetition was then read and ordered to lie on the Table.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary circumstances nothing more would have been heard of the\r\nopposition to Mr. De Grey’s Bill. Hundreds of petitions may have been\r\nso stifled without the world being any the wiser. But Mr. Tooke, who\r\nwould never have known of Mr. De Grey’s intention if he had not had\r\na friend among the clerks of the House of Commons, happened to have\r\nanother friend who was able to help him in a very different way in his\r\npredicament. This was Horne, who was now living in a cottage at Purley,\r\nreading law, on the desperate chance that a man, who was a clergyman\r\nagainst his will, would be admitted to the bar. Flushed rather than\r\nspent by his public quarrel with Wilkes, which was just dying down,\r\nHorne saw in Mr. Tooke’s wrongs an admirable opportunity for a champion\r\nof freedom, whose earlier exploits had been a little tarnished by his\r\nsubsequent feuds with his comrades. Accordingly he responded very\r\npromptly, and published in the _Public Advertiser_ of 11th February,\r\nan anonymous indictment of the Speaker, Sir Fletcher Norton, based on\r\nhis unjust treatment of these petitions. This letter scandalised the\r\nHouse of Commons and drew the unwary Government into a quarrel from\r\nwhich Horne emerged triumphant; for the Government, having been led on\r\nto proceed against Horne, was unable to prove his authorship of the\r\nletter. The incident had consequences of great importance for many\r\npersons. It was the making of Horne, for he became Horne Tooke, with\r\n£8000 from his friend and a reputation as an intrepid and vigilant\r\nchampion of popular liberty that he retained to the day of his death.\r\nIt was also the making of Fox, for it was this youth of twenty-five who\r\nhad led the Government into its scrape, and the king could not forgive\r\nhim. His temerity on this occasion provoked the famous letter from\r\nNorth. ‘Sir, His Majesty has thought proper to order a new Commission\r\nof the Treasury to be made out, in which I do not see your name.’ Fox\r\nleft the court party to lend his impetuous courage henceforth to very\r\ndifferent causes. But for social students the incident is chiefly\r\ninteresting because it was the cause of the introduction of Standing\r\nOrders on Enclosure Bills. It had shown what might happen to rich men\r\nunder the present system. Accordingly the House of Commons set to work\r\nto construct a series of Standing Orders to regulate the proceedings on\r\nEnclosure Bills.\r\n\r\nMost of these Standing Orders have already been mentioned in the\r\nprevious chapter, but we propose to recapitulate their main provisions\r\nin order to show that the gross unfairness of the procedure, described\r\nin the last chapter, as between the rich and the poor, made no\r\nimpression at all upon Parliament. The first Standing Orders dealing\r\nwith Enclosure Bills were passed in 1774, and they were revised in\r\n1775, 1781, 1799, 1800 and 1801. These Standing Orders prevented a\r\nsecret application to Parliament by obliging promoters to publish\r\na notice on the church door; they introduced some control over the\r\nextortions of commissioners, and laid down that the Bill presented\r\nto Parliament should contain the names of the commissioners and a\r\ndescription of the compensation to be given to the lord of the manor\r\nand the impropriator of tithes. But they contained no safeguard at all\r\nagainst robbery of the small proprietors or the commoners. Until 1801\r\nthere was no restriction on the choice of a commissioner, and it was\r\nonly in that year that Parliament adopted the Standing Order providing\r\nthat no lord of the manor, or steward, or bailiff of any lord or lady\r\nor proprietor should be allowed to act as commissioner in an enclosure\r\nin which he was an interested party.[87] In one respect Parliament\r\ndeliberately withdrew a rule introduced to give greater regularity and\r\npublicity to the proceedings of committees. Under the Standing Orders\r\nof 1774, the Chairman of a Committee had to report not only whether the\r\nStanding Orders had been complied with, but also what evidence had been\r\nsubmitted to show that all the necessary formalities had been observed;\r\nbut in the following year the House of Commons struck out this second\r\nprovision. A Committee of the House of Commons suggested in 1799 that\r\nno petition should be admitted for a Parliamentary Bill unless a fourth\r\npart of the proprietors in number and value signed the application, but\r\nthis suggestion was rejected.\r\n\r\nThe poor then found no kind of shelter in the Standing Orders. The\r\nlegislation of this period, from first to last, shows just as great an\r\nindifference to the injustice to which they were exposed. The first\r\npublic Act of the time deals not with enclosures for growing corn,\r\nbut with enclosures for growing wood. The Act of 1756 states in its\r\npreamble that the Acts of Henry VIII., Charles II. and William III. for\r\nencouraging the growth of timber had been obstructed by the resistance\r\nof the commoners, and Parliament therefore found it necessary to enact\r\nthat any owner of waste could enclose for the purpose of growing timber\r\nwith the approval of the majority in number and value of those who\r\nhad common rights, and any majority of those who had common rights\r\ncould enclose with the approval of the owner of the waste. Any person\r\nor persons who thought themselves aggrieved could appeal to Quarter\r\nSessions, within six months after the agreement had been registered. We\r\nhear very little of this Act, and the enclosures that concern us are\r\nenclosures of a different kind. In the final years of the century there\r\nwas a succession of General Enclosure Bills introduced and debated in\r\nParliament, under the stimulus of the fear of famine. These Bills were\r\npromoted by the Board of Agriculture, established in 1793 with Sir\r\nJohn Sinclair as President, and Arthur Young as secretary. This Board\r\nof Agriculture was not a State department in the modern sense, but a\r\nkind of Royal Society receiving, not too regularly, a subsidy from\r\nParliament.[88] As a result of its efforts two Parliamentary Committees\r\nwere appointed to report on the enclosure of waste lands, and the\r\nReports of these Committees, which agreed in recommending a General\r\nEnclosure Bill, were presented in 1795 and 1799. Bills were introduced\r\nin 1795, 1796, 1797 and 1800, but it was not until 1801 that any Act\r\nwas passed.\r\n\r\nThe first Bills presented to Parliament were General Enclosure Bills,\r\nthat is to say, they were Bills for prescribing conditions on which\r\nenclosure could be carried out without application to Parliament. The\r\nBoard of Agriculture was set on this policy partly, as we have seen,\r\nin the interest of agricultural expansion, partly as the only way of\r\nguaranteeing a supply of food during the French war. But these were\r\nnot the only considerations in the mind of Parliament, and we are able\r\nin this case to see what happened to a disinterested proposal when it\r\nhad to pass through the sieve of a Parliament of owners of land and\r\ntithes. For we have in the _Annals of Agriculture_[89] the form of the\r\nGeneral Enclosure Bill of 1796 as it was presented to the Government\r\nby that expert body, the Board of Agriculture, and we have among the\r\nParliamentary Bills in the British Museum (1) the form in which this\r\nBill left a Select Committee, and (2) the form in which it left a\r\nsecond Select Committee of Knights of the Shire and Gentlemen of the\r\nLong Robe. We are thus able to see in what spirit the lords of the\r\nmanor who sat in Parliament regarded, in a moment of great national\r\nurgency, the policy put before it by the Board of Agriculture. We\r\ncome at once upon a fact of great importance. In the first version it\r\nis recognised that Parliament has to consider the future as well as\r\nthe present, that it is dealing not only with the claims of a certain\r\nnumber of living cottagers, whose rights and property may be valued by\r\nthe commissioners at a five pound note, but with the necessities of\r\ngenerations still to be born, and that the most liberal recognition\r\nof the right to pasture a cow, in the form of a cash payment to an\r\nindividual, cannot compensate for the calamities that a society suffers\r\nin the permanent alienation of all its soil. The Bill as drafted in the\r\nBoard of Agriculture enacted that in view of the probable increase of\r\npopulation, a portion of the waste should be set aside, and vested in\r\na corporate body (composed of the lord of the manor, the rector, the\r\nvicar, the churchwardens and the overseers), for allotments for ever.\r\nAny labourer over twenty-one, with a settlement in the parish, could\r\nclaim a portion and hold it for fifty years, rent free, on condition\r\nof building a cottage and fencing it. When the fifty years were over,\r\nthe cottages, with their parcels of land, were to be let on leases of\r\ntwenty-one years and over at reasonable rents, half the rent to go to\r\nthe owner of the soil, and half to the poor rates. The land was never\r\nto be alienated from the cottage. All these far-sighted clauses vanish\r\nabsolutely under the sifting statesmanship of the Parliament, of which\r\nBurke said in all sincerity, in his _Reflections on the Revolution in\r\nFrance_, that ‘our representation has been found perfectly adequate\r\nto all the purposes for which a representation of the people can be\r\ndesired or devised.’\r\n\r\nThere was another respect in which the Board of Agriculture was\r\nconsidered to be too generous to the poor by the lords of the manor,\r\nwho made the laws of England. In version 1 of the Bill, not only those\r\nentitled to such right but also those who have enjoyed or exercised\r\nthe right of getting fuel are to have special and inalienable fuel\r\nallotments made to them: in version 2 only those who are entitled\r\nto such rights are to have a fuel allotment, and in version 3, this\r\ncompensation is restricted to those who have possessed fuel rights\r\nfor ten years. Again in version 1, the cost of enclosing and fencing\r\nsmall allotments, where the owners are unable to pay, is to be borne by\r\nthe other owners: in version 2, the small owners are to be allowed to\r\nmortgage their allotments in order to cover the cost. The importance\r\nof the proposal thus rejected by the Parliamentary Committee will\r\nappear when we come to consider the practical effects of Enclosure\r\nActs. The only people who got their fencing done for them under most\r\nActs were the tithe-owners, a class neither so poor nor so powerless in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nHowever this Bill shared the fate of all other General Enclosure Bills\r\nat this time. There were many obstacles to a General Enclosure Bill.\r\nCertain Members of Parliament resisted them on the ground that if it\r\nwere made legal for a majority to coerce a minority into enclosure\r\nwithout coming to Parliament, such protection as the smaller commoners\r\nderived from the possibility of Parliamentary discussion would\r\ndisappear. Powis quarrelled with the Bill of 1796 on this ground, and\r\nhe was supported by Fox and Grey, but his objections were overruled.\r\nHowever a more formidable opposition came from other quarters.\r\nEnclosure Acts furnished Parliamentary officials with a harvest of\r\nfees,[90] and the Church thought it dangerous that enclosure, affecting\r\ntithe-owners, should be carried through without the bishops being given\r\nan opportunity of interfering. These and other forces were powerful\r\nenough to destroy this and all General Enclosure Bills, intended to\r\nmake application to Parliament unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Agriculture accordingly changed its plans. In 1800 the\r\nBoard abandoned its design of a General Enclosure Bill, and presented\r\ninstead a consolidating Bill, which was to cheapen procedure. Hitherto\r\nthere had been great diversities of form and every Bill was an\r\nexpensive little work of art of its own. The Act of 1801 was designed\r\nto save promoters of enclosure some of this trouble and expense. It\r\ntook some forty clauses that were commonly found in Enclosure Bills and\r\nprovided that they could be incorporated by reference in private Bills,\r\nthus cheapening legal procedure. Further, it allowed affidavits to be\r\naccepted as evidence, thus relieving the promoters from the obligation\r\nof bringing witnesses before the Committee to swear to every signature.\r\nAll the recognition that was given to the difficulties and the claims\r\nof the poor was comprised in sections 12 and 13, which allow small\r\nallotments to be laid together and depastured in common, and instruct\r\nthe commissioners to have particular regard to the convenience of the\r\nowners or proprietors of the smallest estates. In 1813, the idea of\r\na General Bill was revived once more, and a Bill passed the House of\r\nCommons which gave a majority of three-fifths in value the right to\r\npetition Quarter Sessions for an enclosure. The Bill was rejected in\r\nthe Lords. In 1836 a General Enclosure Bill was passed, permitting\r\nenclosure when two-thirds in number and value desired it, and in 1845\r\nParliament appointed central Commissioners with a view to preventing\r\nlocal injustice.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the Parliamentary Reports of the debates on\r\nGeneral Enclosure Bills in the unreformed Parliament are almost as\r\nmeagre as the debates on particular Enclosure Bills. We can gather from\r\nvarious indications that the rights of the clergy received a good deal\r\nof notice, and Lord Grenville made an indignant speech to vindicate\r\nhis zeal in the cause of the Church, which had been questioned by\r\nopponents. The cause of the poor does not often ruffle the surface of\r\ndiscussion. This we can collect not only from negative evidence but\r\nalso from a statement by Mr. Lechmere, Member for Worcester. Lechmere,\r\nwhose loss of his seat in 1796 deprived the poor of one of their very\r\nfew champions in Parliament, drew attention more than once during the\r\ndiscussions on scarcity and the high price of corn to the lamentable\r\nconsequences of the disappearances of the small farms, and recommended\r\ndrastic steps to arrest the process. Philip Francis gave him some\r\nsupport. The general temper of Parliament can be divined from his\r\ncomplaint that when these subjects were under discussion it was very\r\ndifficult to make a House.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the apathy of the aristocracy was part of\r\na universal blindness or anæsthesia, and that the method and procedure\r\nof enclosure were accepted as just and inevitable, without challenge\r\nor protest from any quarter. The poor were of course bitterly hostile.\r\nThis appears not only from the petitions presented to Parliament,\r\nbut from the echoes that have reached us of actual violence. It was\r\nnaturally easier for the threatened commoners to riot in places where\r\na single enclosure scheme affected a wide district, and most of the\r\nrecords of popular disturbances that have come down to us are connected\r\nwith attempts to enclose moors that were common to several parishes.\r\nAn interesting example is afforded by the history of the enclosure\r\nof Haute Huntre Fen in Lincolnshire. This enclosure, which affected\r\neleven parishes, was sanctioned by Parliament in 1767, but three years\r\nlater the Enclosure Commissioners had to come to Parliament to explain\r\nthat the posts and rails that they had set up had been destroyed ‘by\r\nmalicious persons, in order to hinder the execution of the said Act,’\r\nand to ask for permission to make ditches instead of fences.[91]\r\nAn example of disturbances in a single village is given by the\r\nBedfordshire reporter for the Board of Agriculture, who says that when\r\nMaulden was enclosed it was found necessary to send for troops from\r\nCoventry to quell the riots:[92] and another in the _Annual Register_\r\nfor 1799[93] describing the resistance of the commoners at Wilbarston\r\nin Northamptonshire, and the employment of two troops of yeomanry to\r\ncoerce them. The general hatred of the poor for enclosures is evident\r\nfrom the language of Eden, and from statements of contributors to the\r\n_Annals of Agriculture_. Eden had included a question about commons\r\nand enclosures in the questions he put to his correspondents, and he\r\nsays in his preface that he had been disappointed that so few of his\r\ncorrespondents had given an answer to this question. He then proceeds\r\nto give this explanation: ‘This question, like most others, that can\r\nnow be touched upon, has its popular and its unpopular sides: and\r\nwhere no immediate self-interest, or other partial leaning, interferes\r\nto bias the judgment, a good-natured man cannot but wish to think\r\nwith the multitudes; stunned as his ears must daily be, with the\r\noft-repeated assertion, that, to condemn commons, is to determine\r\non depopulating the country.’[94] The writer of the _Bedfordshire\r\nReport_ in 1808 says that ‘it appears that the poor have invariably\r\nbeen inimical to enclosures, as they certainly remain to the present\r\nday.’[95] Dr. Wilkinson, writing in the _Annals of Agriculture_[96]\r\nin favour of a General Enclosure Bill says, ‘the grand objection to\r\nthe inclosure of commons arises from the unpopularity which gentlemen\r\nwho are active in the cause expose themselves to in their own\r\nneighbourhood, from the discontent of the poor when any such question\r\nis agitated.’ Arthur Young makes a similar statement.[97] ‘A general\r\ninclosure has been long ago proposed to administration, but particular\r\nones have been so unpopular in some cases that government were afraid\r\nof the measure.’\r\n\r\nThe popular feeling, though quite unrepresented in Parliament, was not\r\nunrepresented in contemporary literature. During the last years of the\r\neighteenth century there was a sharp war of pamphlets on the merits\r\nof enclosure, and it is noticeable that both supporters and opponents\r\ndenounced the methods on which the governing class acted. There is,\r\namong others, a very interesting anonymous pamphlet, published in 1781\r\nunder the title of _An Inquiry into the Advantages and Disadvantages\r\nresulting from Bills of Inclosure_, in which the existing practice is\r\nreviewed and some excellent suggestions are made for reform. The writer\r\nproposed that the preliminary to a Bill should be not the fixing of a\r\nnotice to the church door, but the holding of a public meeting, that\r\nthere should be six commissioners, that they should be elected by the\r\ncommoners by ballot, that no decision should be valid that was not\r\nunanimous, and that an appeal from that decision should lie not to\r\nQuarter Sessions, but to Judges of Assize. The same writer proposed\r\nthat no enclosure should be sanctioned which did not allot one acre to\r\neach cottage.\r\n\r\nThese proposals came from an opponent of enclosure, but the most\r\ndistinguished supporters of enclosure were also discontented with the\r\nprocedure. Who are the writers on eighteenth-century agriculture whose\r\nnames and publications are known and remembered? They are, first of\r\nall, Arthur Young (1741-1820), who, though he failed as a merchant and\r\nfailed as a farmer, and never ceased to regret his father’s mistake\r\nin neglecting to put him into the soft lap of a living in the Church,\r\nmade for himself, by the simple process of observing and recording,\r\na European reputation as an expert adviser in the art which he had\r\npractised with so little success. A scarcely less important authority\r\nwas William Marshall (1745-1818), who began by trading in the West\r\nIndies, afterwards farmed in Surrey, and then became agent in Norfolk\r\nto Sir Harbord Harbord. It was Marshall who suggested the creation of\r\na Board of Rural Affairs, and the preparation of Surveys and Minutes.\r\nThough he never held an official position, it was from his own choice,\r\nfor he preferred to publish his own Minutes and Surveys rather than to\r\nwrite them for the Board. He was interested in philology as well as in\r\nagriculture; he published a vocabulary of the Yorkshire dialect and\r\nhe was a friend of Johnson, whom he rather scandalised by condoning\r\nSunday labour in agriculture under special circumstances. Nathaniel\r\nKent (1737-1810) studied husbandry in the Austrian Netherlands, where\r\nhe had been secretary to an ambassador, and on his return to England\r\nin 1766 he was employed as an estate agent and land valuer. He wrote\r\na well-known book _Hints to Gentlemen of Landed Property_, and he had\r\nconsiderable influence in improving the management of various estates.\r\nHe was, for a short time, bailiff of George III.’s farm at Windsor.\r\n\r\nAll of these writers, though they are very far from taking the view\r\nwhich found expression in the riots in the Lincolnshire fens, or in the\r\nanonymous pamphlet already mentioned, addressed some very important\r\ncriticisms and recommendations to the class that was enclosing the\r\nEnglish commons. Both Marshall and Young complained of the injustice\r\nof the method of choosing commissioners. Marshall, ardent champion\r\nof enclosure as he was, and no sentimentalist on the subject of the\r\ncommoners, wrote a most bitter account of the motives of the enclosers.\r\n‘At this juncture, it is true, the owners of manors and tithes, whether\r\nclergy or laity, men of ministry or men of opposition, are equally on\r\nthe alert: not however pressing forward with offerings and sacrifices\r\nto relieve the present distresses of the country, but searching for\r\nvantage ground to aid them in the scramble.’[98] Holding this view,\r\nhe was not unnaturally ill-content with the plan of letting the big\r\nlandlords nominate the commissioners, and proposed that the lord of the\r\nsoil and the owner or owners of tithes should choose one commissioner\r\neach, that the owner or owners of pasturage should choose two, and that\r\nthe four should choose a fifth. Arthur Young proposed that the small\r\nproprietors should have a share in the nomination of commissioners\r\neither by a union of votes or otherwise, as might be determined.\r\n\r\nThe general engrossing of farms was arraigned by Thomas Stone, the\r\nauthor of an important pamphlet, _Suggestions for rendering the\r\ninclosure of common fields and waste lands a source of population and\r\nof riches_, 1787, who proposed that in future enclosures farms should\r\nbe let out in different sizes from £40 to £200 a year. He thought\r\nfurther that Parliament should consider the advisability of forbidding\r\nthe alienation of cottagers’ property, in order to stop the frittering\r\naway of cottagers’ estates which was general under enclosure. Kent,\r\na passionate enthusiast for enclosing, was not less critical of the\r\npractice of throwing farms together, a practice which had raised the\r\nprice of provisions to the labourer, and he appealed to landlords to\r\naid the distressed poor by reducing the size of their farms, as well as\r\nby raising wages. Arbuthnot, the author of a pamphlet on _An Inquiry\r\ninto the Connection between the present Price of Provisions and the\r\nSize of Farms_, by a Farmer, 1773, who had defended the large-farm\r\nsystem against Dr. Price, wrote, ‘My plan is to allot to each cottage\r\nthree or four acres which should be annexed to it without power or\r\nalienation and without rent while under the covenant of being kept in\r\ngrass.’\r\n\r\nSo much for writers on agriculture. But the eighteenth century produced\r\ntwo authoritative writers on social conditions. Any student of social\r\nhistory who wishes to understand this period would first turn to the\r\nthree great volumes of Eden’s _State of the Poor_, published in 1797,\r\nas a storehouse of cold facts. Davies, who wrote _The Case of Labourers\r\nin Husbandry_, published in 1795, is less famous than he deserves to\r\nbe, if we are to judge from the fact that the _Dictionary of National\r\nBiography_ only knows about him that he was Rector of Barkham in\r\nBerkshire, and a graduate of Jesus College, Oxford, that he received\r\na D.D. degree in 1800, that he is the author of this book, and that\r\nhe died, perhaps, in the year 1809. But Davies’ book, which contains\r\nthe result of most careful and patient investigation, made a profound\r\nimpression on contemporary observers. Howlett called it ‘incomparable,’\r\nand it is impossible for the modern reader to resist its atmosphere of\r\nreality and truth. This country parson gives us a simple, faithful and\r\nsincere picture of the facts, seen without illusion or prejudice, and\r\nfree from all the conventional affectations of the time: a priceless\r\nlegacy to those who are impatient of the generalisations with which\r\nthe rich dismiss the poor. Now both of these writers warned their\r\ncontemporaries of the danger of the uncontrolled tendencies of the age.\r\nEden proposed that in every enclosure a certain quantity of land should\r\nbe reserved for cottagers and labourers, to be vested in the whole\r\ndistrict. He spoke in favour of the crofters in Scotland, and declared\r\nthat provision of this kind was made for the labouring classes in the\r\nfirst settled townships of New England. Davies was still more emphatic\r\nin calling upon England to settle cottagers and to arrest the process\r\nof engrossing farms.[99]\r\n\r\nThus of all the remembered writers of the period who had any practical\r\nknowledge of agriculture or of the poor, there is not one who did\r\nnot try to teach the governing class the need for reform, and the\r\ndangers of the state into which they were allowing rural society\r\nto drift. Parliament was assailed on all sides with criticisms and\r\nrecommendations, and its refusal to alter its ways was deliberate.\r\n\r\nOf the protests of the time the most important and significant came\r\nfrom Arthur Young. No man had been so impatient of objections to\r\nenclosure: no man had taken so severe and disciplinary a view of\r\nthe labourer: no man had dismissed so lightly the appeals for the\r\npreservation of the fragmentary possessions of the poor. He had\r\ntaught a very simple philosophy, that the more the landowner pressed\r\nthe farmer, and the more the farmer pressed the labourer, the better\r\nit was for agriculture. He had believed as implicitly as Sinclair\r\nhimself, and with apparently as little effort to master the facts, that\r\nthe cottagers were certain to benefit by enclosure. All this gives\r\npathos, as well as force, to his remarkable paper, published under the\r\ntitle _An Inquiry into the Propriety of applying Wastes to the better\r\nMaintenance and Support of the Poor_.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this document is interesting. It was written in 1801, a\r\nfew years after the Speenhamland system had begun to fix itself on the\r\nvillages. The growth of the poor rates was troubling the minds of the\r\nupper and middle classes. Arthur Young, in the course of his travels\r\nat this time, stumbled on the discovery that in those parishes where\r\nthe cottagers had been able to keep together a tiny patch of property,\r\nthey had shown a Spartan determination to refuse the refuge of the Poor\r\nLaw. When once he had observed this, he made further investigations\r\nwhich only confirmed his first impressions. This opened his eyes to the\r\nconsequences of enclosure as it had been carried out, and he began to\r\nexamine the history of these operations in a new spirit. He then found\r\nthat enclosure had destroyed with the property of the poor one of the\r\ngreat incentives to industry and self-respect, and that his view that\r\nthe benefit of the commons to the poor was ‘perfectly contemptible,’\r\nand ‘when it tempts them to become owners of cattle or sheep usually\r\nruinous,’[100] was fundamentally wrong. Before the enclosures, the\r\ndespised commons had enabled the cottager to keep a cow, and this,\r\nso far from bringing ruin, had meant in very many cases all the\r\ndifference between independence and pauperism. His scrutiny of the\r\nActs convinced him that in respect of this they had been unjust. ‘By\r\nnineteen out of twenty Inclosure Bills the poor are injured, and some\r\ngrossly injured.... Mr. Forster of Norwich, after giving me an account\r\nof twenty inclosures in which he had acted as Commissioner, stated his\r\nopinion on their general effect on the poor, and lamented that he had\r\nbeen accessory to the injuring of 2000 poor people, at the rate of\r\ntwenty families per parish.... The poor in these parishes may say, and\r\nwith truth, “Parliament may be tender of property: all I know is that\r\nI had a cow and an Act of Parliament has taken it from me.”’\r\n\r\nThis paper appeared on the eve of the Enclosure Act of 1801, the Act to\r\nfacilitate and cheapen procedure, which Young and Sinclair had worked\r\nhard to secure. It was therefore an opportune moment for trying to\r\ntemper enclosure to the difficulties of the poor. Arthur Young made a\r\npassionate appeal to the upper classes to remember these difficulties.\r\n‘To pass Acts beneficial to every other class in the State and hurtful\r\nto the lowest class only, when the smallest alteration would prevent\r\nit, is a conduct against which reason, justice and humanity equally\r\nplead.’ He then proceeded to outline a constructive scheme. He proposed\r\nthat twenty millions should be spent in setting up half a million\r\nfamilies with allotments and cottages: the fee-simple of the cottage\r\nand land to be vested in the parish, and possession granted under\r\nan Act of Parliament, on condition that if the father or his family\r\nbecame chargeable to the rates, the cottage and land should revert to\r\nthe parish. The parishes were to carry out the scheme, borrowing the\r\nnecessary money on the security of the rates.[101] ‘A man,’ he told\r\nthe landlords, in a passage touched perhaps with remorse as well as\r\nwith compassion, ‘will love his country the better even for a pig.’\r\n‘At a moment,’ so he concludes, ‘when a General Inclosure of Wastes is\r\nbefore Parliament, to allow such a measure to be carried into execution\r\nin conformity with the practice hitherto, without entering one voice,\r\nhowever feeble, in defence of the interests of the poor, would have\r\nbeen a wound to the feelings of any man not lost to humanity who had\r\nviewed the scenes which I have visited.’\r\n\r\nThe appeal broke against a dense mass of class prejudice, and so far as\r\nany effect on the Consolidating Act of 1801 is concerned, Arthur Young\r\nmight never have written a line. This is perhaps not surprising, for we\r\nknow from Young’s autobiography (p. 350) that he did not even carry the\r\nBoard of Agriculture with him, and that Lord Carrington, who was then\r\nPresident, only allowed him to print his appeal on the understanding\r\nthat it was not published as an official document, and that the\r\nBoard was in no way identified with it. Sinclair, who shared Young’s\r\nconversion, had ceased to be President in 1798. The compunction he\r\ntried to awaken did affect an Act here and there. A witness before the\r\nAllotments Committee of 1843 described the arrangements he contrived\r\nto introduce into an Enclosure Act. The witness was Mr. Demainbray, an\r\nadmirable and most public-spirited parson, Rector of Broad Somerford\r\nin Wiltshire. Mr. Demainbray explained that when the Enclosure Act for\r\nhis parish was prepared in 1806, he had been pressed to accept land in\r\nlieu of tithes, and that he took the opportunity to stipulate for some\r\nprovision for the poor. As a consequence of his efforts, half an acre\r\nwas attached to each cottage on the waste, the land being vested in\r\nthe rector, churchwardens and overseers for the time being, and eight\r\nacres were reserved for the villagers for allotment and reallotment\r\nevery Easter. This arrangement, which had excellent results, ‘every man\r\nlooking forward to becoming a man of property,’ was copied in several\r\nof the neighbouring parishes. Dr. Slater has collected some other\r\nexamples. One Act, passed in 1824 for Pottern in Wiltshire, vested\r\nthe ownership of the enclosed common in the Bishop of Salisbury, who\r\nwas lord of the manor, the vicar, and the churchwardens, in trust for\r\nthe parish. The trustees were required to lease it in small holdings\r\nto poor, honest and industrious persons, who had not, except in cases\r\nof accident or sickness, availed themselves of Poor Law Relief.[102]\r\nThomas Stone’s proposal for making inalienable allotments to cottagers\r\nwas adopted in two or three Acts in the eastern counties, but the Acts\r\nthat made some provision for the poor do not amount, in Dr. Slater’s\r\nopinion, to more than one per cent. of the Enclosure Acts passed before\r\n1845,[103] and this view is corroborated by the great stress laid in\r\nthe Reports of the Society for Bettering the Condition of the Poor,\r\nupon a few cases where the poor were considered, and by a statement\r\nmade by Mr. Demainbray in a pamphlet published in 1831.[104] In this\r\npamphlet Mr. Demainbray quotes what Davies had said nearly forty years\r\nearlier about the effect of enclosures in robbing the poor, and then\r\nadds: ‘Since that time many hundred enclosures have taken place, but in\r\nhow few of them has any reserve been made for the privileges which the\r\npoor man and his ancestors had for centuries enjoyed?’\r\n\r\nSome interesting provisions are contained in certain of the Acts\r\nanalysed in the Appendix. At Stanwell the commissioners were to set\r\naside such parcel as they thought proper not exceeding thirty acres, to\r\nbe let out and the rents and profits were to be given for the benefit\r\nof such occupiers and inhabitants as did not receive parochial relief\r\nor occupy lands and tenements of more than £5 a year, and had not\r\nreceived any allotment under the Act. Middleton, the writer of the\r\n_Report on Middlesex_, says that the land produced £30 a year,[105]\r\nand he remarks that this is a much better way of helping the poor than\r\nleaving them land for their use. We may doubt whether the arrangement\r\nseemed equally attractive to the poor. It could not have been much\r\ncompensation to John Carter, who owned a cottage, to receive three\r\nroods, twenty-six perches in lieu of his rights of common, which is\r\nhis allotment in the award, for three-quarters of an acre is obviously\r\ninsufficient for the pasture of a cow, but it was perhaps still less\r\nsatisfactory for James Carter to know that one acre and seven perches\r\nwere allotted to the ‘lawful owner or owners’ of the cottage and land\r\nwhich he occupied, and that his own compensation for the loss of his\r\ncow or sheep or geese was the cold hope that if he kept off the rates,\r\nSir William Gibbons, the vicar, and the parish officers might give\r\nhim a dole. The Laleham Commissioners were evidently men of a rather\r\ngrim humour, for, in setting aside thirteen acres for the poor, they\r\nauthorised the churchwardens and overseers to encourage the poor, if\r\nthey were so minded, by letting this plot for sixty years and using the\r\nmoney so received to build a workhouse. A much more liberal provision\r\nwas made at Cheshunt, where the poor were allowed 100 acres. At\r\nKnaresborough and Louth, the poor got nothing at all.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to describe the results of enclosure on village\r\nlife, we may remark one curious fact. In 1795 and 1796 there was some\r\ndiscussion in the House of Commons of the condition of the agricultural\r\nlabourers, arising out of the proposal of Whitbread’s to enable the\r\nmagistrates to fix a minimum wage. Pitt made a long speech in reply,\r\nand promised to introduce a scheme of his own for correcting evils\r\nthat were too conspicuous to be ignored. This promise he kept next\r\nyear in the ill-fated Poor Law Bill, which died, almost at its birth,\r\nof general hostility. That Bill will be considered elsewhere. All\r\nthat we are concerned to notice here is that neither speech nor Bill,\r\nthough they cover a wide range of topics, and though Pitt said that\r\nthey represented the results of long and careful inquiry, hint at this\r\ncause of social disturbance, or at the importance of safe-guarding the\r\ninterests of the poor in future enclosure schemes: this in spite of the\r\nfact that, as we have seen, there was scarcely any contemporary writer\r\nor observer who had not pointed out that the way in which the governing\r\nclass was conducting these revolutions was not only unjust to the poor\r\nbut perilous to the State.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, in the light of the failure to grasp and retrieve\r\nan error in national policy which marks the progress of these\r\ntransactions, to glance at the contemporary history of France.\r\nThe Legislative Assembly, under the influence of the ideas of the\r\neconomists, decreed the division of the land of the communes in 1792.\r\nThe following year this decree was modified. Certain provincial\r\nassemblies had asked for division, but many of the villages were\r\ninexorably hostile. The new decree of June 1793 tried to do justice\r\nto these conflicting wishes by making division optional. At the same\r\ntime it insisted on an equitable division in cases where partition took\r\nplace. But this policy of division was found to have done such damage\r\nto the interests of the poor that there was strenuous opposition, with\r\nthe result that in 1796 the process was suspended, and in the following\r\nyear it was forbidden.[106] Can any one suppose that if the English\r\nlegislature had had as swift and ready a sense for things going wrong,\r\nthe policy of enclosure would have been pursued after 1801 with the\r\nsame reckless disregard for its social consequences?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have given in the last chapter the history of an enclosure project\r\nfor the light it throws on the play of motive in the enclosing class.\r\nWe propose now to give in some detail the history of an enclosure\r\nproject that succeeded for the light it throws on the attention which\r\nParliament paid to local opinion, and on the generally received views\r\nas to the rights of the small commoners. Our readers will observe that\r\nthis enclosure took place after the criticisms and appeals which we\r\nhave described had all been published.\r\n\r\nOtmoor is described in Dunkin’s _History of Oxfordshire_,[107] as a\r\n‘dreary and extensive common.’ Tradition said that the tract of land\r\nwas the gift of some mysterious lady ‘who gave as much ground as she\r\ncould ride round while an oat-sheaf was burning, to the inhabitants of\r\nits vicinity for a public common,’ and hence came its name of Oatmoor,\r\ncorrupted into Otmoor. Whatever the real origin of the name, which\r\nmore prosaic persons connected with ‘_Oc_’, a Celtic word for ‘water,’\r\nthis tract of land had been used as a ‘public common without stint ...\r\nfrom remote antiquity.’ Lord Abingdon, indeed, as Lord of the Manor of\r\nBeckley, claimed and exercised the right of appointing a moor-driver,\r\nwho at certain seasons drove all the cattle into Beckley, where those\r\nwhich were unidentified became Lord Abingdon’s property. Lord Abingdon\r\nalso claimed rights of soil and of sport: these, like his other claim,\r\nwere founded on prescription only, as there was no trace of any grant\r\nfrom the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe use to which Otmoor, in its original state, was put, is thus\r\ndescribed by Dunkin. ‘Whilst this extensive piece of land remained\r\nunenclosed, the farmers of the several adjoining townships estimated\r\nthe profits of a summer’s pasturage at 20s. per head, subject to\r\nthe occasional loss of a beast by a peculiar distemper called the\r\nmoor-evil. But the greatest benefit was reaped by the cottagers,\r\nmany of whom turned out large numbers of geese, to which the coarse\r\naquatic sward was well suited, and thereby brought up their families in\r\ncomparative plenty.[108]\r\n\r\n‘Of late years, however, this dreary waste was surveyed with longing\r\neyes by the surrounding landowners, most of whom wished to annex a\r\nportion of it to their estates, and in consequence spared no pains to\r\nrecommend the enclosure as a measure beneficial to the country.’\r\n\r\nThe promoters of the enclosure credited themselves with far loftier\r\nmotives: prominent among them being a desire to improve the morals\r\nof the poor. An advocate of the enclosure afterwards described the\r\npitiable state of the poor in pre-enclosure days in these words: ‘In\r\nlooking after a brood of goslings, a few rotten sheep, a skeleton of a\r\ncow or a mangy horse, they lost more than they might have gained by\r\ntheir day’s work, and acquired habits of idleness and dissipation and\r\na dislike to honest labour, which has rendered them the riotous and\r\nlawless set of men which they have now shown themselves to be.’ A pious\r\nwish to second the intention of Providence was also a strong incentive:\r\n‘God did not create the earth to lie waste for feeding a few geese, but\r\nto be cultivated by man, in the sweat of his brow.’[109]\r\n\r\nThe first proposal for enclosure came to Parliament from George, Duke\r\nof Marlborough, and others on 11th March, 1801. The duke petitioned for\r\nthe drainage and the allotment of the 4000 acres of Otmoor among the\r\nparishes concerned, namely Beckley (with Horton and Studley), Noke,\r\nOddington, and Charlton (with Fencott and Moorcott). This petition was\r\nreferred to a Committee, to consider amongst other things, whether the\r\nStanding Orders with reference to Drainage Bills had been duly complied\r\nwith. The Committee reported in favour of allowing the introduction of\r\nthe Bill, but made this remarkable admission, that though the Standing\r\nOrders with respect to the affixing of notices on church doors had been\r\ncomplied with on Sunday, 3rd August, ‘it appeared to the Committee\r\nthat on the following Sunday, the 10th of August, the Person employed\r\nto affix the like Notices was prevented from so doing at Beckley,\r\nOddington and Charlton, by a Mob at each Place, but that he read the\r\nNotices to the Persons assembled, and afterwards threw them amongst\r\nthem into the Church Yards of those Parishes.’ Notice was duly affixed\r\nthat Sunday at Noke. The next Sunday matters were even worse, for no\r\nnotices were allowed to be fixed in any parish.\r\n\r\nThe Bill that was introduced in spite of this local protest, was\r\nshipwrecked during its Committee stage by a petition from Alexander\r\nCroke, LL.D., Lord of the Manor of Studley with Whitecross Green, and\r\nfrom John Mackarness, Esq., who stated that as proprietors in the\r\nparish of Beckley, their interests had not been sufficiently considered.\r\n\r\nThe next application to Parliament was not made till 1814. In the\r\ninterval various plans were propounded, and Arthur Young, in his\r\n_Survey of Oxfordshire for the Board of Agriculture_, published in 1809\r\n(a work which Dunkin describes as supported by the farmers and their\r\nlandlords and as having caught their strain), lamented the wretched\r\nstate of the land. ‘I made various inquiries into the present value\r\nof it by rights of commonage; but could ascertain no more than the\r\ngeneral fact, of its being to a very beggarly amount.... Upon the\r\nwhole, the present produce must be quite contemptible, when compared\r\nwith the benefit which would result from enclosing it. And I cannot\r\nbut remark, that such a tract of waste land in summer, and covered\r\nthe winter through with water, to remain in such a state, within five\r\nmiles of Oxford and the Thames, in a kingdom that regularly imports to\r\nthe amount of a million sterling in corn, and is almost periodically\r\nvisited with apprehensions of want--is a scandal to the national\r\npolicy.... If drained and enclosed, it is said that no difficulty would\r\noccur in letting it at 30s. per acre, and some assert even 40s.’ (p.\r\n228).\r\n\r\nWhen the new application was made in November 1814, it was again\r\nreferred to a Committee, who again had to report turbulent behaviour\r\nin the district concerned. Notices had been fixed on all the church\r\ndoors on 7th August, and on three doors on 14th August, ‘but it was\r\nfound impracticable to affix the Notices on the Church doors of the\r\nother two Parishes on that day, owing to large Mobs, armed with every\r\ndescription of offensive weapons, having assembled for the purpose of\r\nobstructing the persons who went to affix the Notices, and who were\r\nprevented by violence, and threats of immediate death, from approaching\r\nthe Churches.’[110] From the same cause no notices could be affixed on\r\nthese two church doors on 21st or 28th August.\r\n\r\nThese local disturbances were not allowed to check the career of the\r\nBill. It was read a first time on 21st February, and a second time on\r\n7th March. But meanwhile some serious flaws had been discovered. The\r\nDuke of Marlborough and the Earl of Abingdon both petitioned against\r\nit. The Committee, however, were able to introduce amendments that\r\nsatisfied both these powerful personages, and on 1st May Mr. Fane\r\nreported from the Committee that no persons had appeared for the\r\nsaid petitions, and that the parties concerned had consented to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Committee, and had also consented ‘to the changing\r\nthe Commissioners therein named.’ Before the Report had been passed,\r\nhowever, a petition was received on behalf of Alexander Croke,[111]\r\nEsq., who was now in Nova Scotia, which made further amendments\r\nnecessary, and the Committee was empowered to send for persons, papers\r\nand records. Meanwhile the humbler individuals whose future was\r\nimperilled were also bestirring themselves. They applied to the Keeper\r\nof the Records in the Augmentation Office for a report on the history\r\nof Otmoor. This Report, which is published at length by Dunkin,[112]\r\nstates that in spite of laborious research no mention of Otmoor could\r\nbe found in any single record from the time of William the Conqueror\r\nto the present day. Even _Doomsday Book_ contained no reference to it.\r\nNowhere did it appear in what manor Otmoor was comprehended, nor was\r\nthere any record that any of the lords of neighbouring manors had ever\r\nbeen made capable of enjoying any rights of common upon it. The custom\r\nof usage without stint, in fact, pointed to some grant before the\r\nmemory of man, and made it unlikely that any lord of the manor had ever\r\nhad absolute right of soil. Armed, no doubt, with this learned report,\r\nsome ‘Freeholders, Landholders, Cottagers and Persons’ residing in four\r\nparishes sent up a petition asking to be heard against the Bill. But\r\nthey were too late: their petition was ordered to lie on the Table, and\r\nthe Bill passed the Commons the same day (26th June) and received the\r\nRoyal Assent on 12th July.\r\n\r\nThe Act directed that one-sixteenth of the whole (which was stated\r\nto be over 4000 acres) should be given to the Lord of the Manor of\r\nBeckley, Lord Abingdon, in compensation of his rights of soil, and\r\none-eighth as composition for all tithes. Thus Lord Abingdon received,\r\nto start with, about 750 acres. The residue was to be allotted among\r\nthe various parishes, townships and hamlets, each allotment to be held\r\nas a common pasture for the township. So far, beyond the fact that\r\nLord Abingdon had taken off more than a sixth part of their common\r\npasture, and that the pasture was now divided up into different parts,\r\nit did not seem that the ordinary inhabitants were much affected. The\r\nsting lay in the arrangements for the future of these divided common\r\npastures. ‘And if at any future time the major part in value of the\r\nseveral persons interested in such plot or parcels of land, should\r\nrequire a separate division of the said land, he (the commissioner) is\r\ndirected to divide and allot the same among the several proprietors, in\r\nproportion to their individual rights and interests therein.’[113]\r\n\r\nWe have, fortunately, a very clear statement of the way in which\r\nthe ‘rights and interests’ of the poorer inhabitants of the Otmoor\r\ntowns were regarded in the enclosure. These inhabitants, it must be\r\nremembered, had enjoyed rights of common without any stint from time\r\nimmemorial, simply by virtue of living in the district. In a letter\r\nfrom ‘An Otmoor Proprietor’ to the Oxford papers in 1830, the writer\r\n(Sir Alexander Croke himself?), who was evidently a man of some local\r\nimportance, explains that by the general rule of law a commoner is\r\nnot entitled to turn on to the common more cattle than are sufficient\r\nto manure and stock the land to which the right of common is annexed.\r\nAccordingly, houses without land attached to them cannot, strictly\r\nspeaking, claim a right of common. How then explain the state of\r\naffairs at Otmoor, where all the inhabitants, landed or landless,\r\nenjoyed the same rights? By prescription, he answers, mere houses do\r\nin point of fact sometimes acquire a right of common, but this right,\r\nthough it may be said to be without stint, is in reality always liable\r\nto be stinted by law. Hence, when a common like Otmoor is enclosed, the\r\nallotments are made as elsewhere in proportion to the amount of land\r\npossessed by each commoner, whilst a ‘proportionable share’ is thrown\r\nin to those who own mere houses. But even this share, he points out,\r\ndoes not necessarily belong to the person who has been exercising the\r\nright of common, unless he happens to own his own house. It belongs\r\nto his landlord, who alone is entitled to compensation. A superficial\r\nobserver might perhaps think this a hardship, but in point of fact it\r\nis quite just. The tenants, occupying the houses, must have been paying\r\na higher rent in consideration of the right attached to the houses, and\r\nthey have always been liable to be turned out by the landlord at will.\r\n‘They had no permanent interest, and it has been decided by the law\r\nthat _no man can have any right in any common, as belonging to a house,\r\nwherein he has no interest but only habitation_: so that the poor, as\r\nsuch, had no right to the common whatever.’[114]\r\n\r\nThe results of the Act, framed and administered on these lines, were\r\ndescribed by Dunkin,[115] writing in 1823, as follows: ‘It now only\r\nremains to notice the effect of the operation of this act. On the\r\ndivision of the land allotted to the respective townships, a certain\r\nportion was assigned to each cottager in lieu of his accustomed\r\ncommonage, but the delivery of the allotment did not take place,\r\nunless the party to whom it was assigned paid his share of the expenses\r\nincurred in draining and dividing the waste: and he was also further\r\ndirected to enclose the same with a fence. The poverty of the cottager\r\nin general prevented his compliance with these conditions, and he was\r\nnecessitated to sell his share for any paltry sum that was offered.\r\nIn the spring of 1819, several persons at Charlton and elsewhere made\r\nprofitable speculations by purchasing these commons for £5 each, and\r\nafterwards prevailing on the commissioners to throw them into one lot,\r\nthus forming a valuable estate. In this way was Otmoor lost to the poor\r\nman, and awarded to the rich, under the specious idea of benefitting\r\nthe public.’ The expenses of the Act, it may be mentioned, came to\r\nsomething between £20,000 and £30,000, or more than the fee-simple of\r\nthe soil.[116]\r\n\r\nEnclosed Otmoor did not fulfil Arthur Young’s hopes: ‘... instead\r\nof the expected improvement in the quality of the soil, it has been\r\nrendered almost totally worthless; a great proportion being at this\r\nmoment over-rated at 5s. an acre yearly rent, few crops yielding\r\nany more than barely sufficient to pay for labour and seed.’[117]\r\nThis excess of expenses over profits was adduced by the ‘Otmoor\r\nproprietor,’ to whom we have already referred, as an illustration of\r\nthe public-spirited self-sacrifice of the enclosers, who were paying\r\nout of their own pockets for a national benefit, and by making some, at\r\nany rate, of the land capable of cultivation, were enabling the poor to\r\nhave ‘an honest employment, instead of losing their time in idleness\r\nand waste.’[118] But fifteen years of this ‘honest employment’ failed\r\nto reconcile the poor to their new position, and in 1830 they were able\r\nto express their feelings in a striking manner.[119]\r\n\r\nIn the course of his drainage operations, the commissioner had made a\r\nnew channel for the river Ray, at a higher level, with the disastrous\r\nresult that the Ray overflowed into a valuable tract of low land above\r\nOtmoor. For two years the farmers of this tract suffered severe losses\r\n(one farmer was said to have lost £400 in that time), then they took\r\nthe law into their own hands, and in June 1829 cut the embankments,\r\nso that the waters of the Ray again flowed over Otmoor and left their\r\nvaluable land unharmed. Twenty-two farmers were indicted for felony for\r\nthis act, but they were acquitted at the Assizes, under the direction\r\nof Mr. Justice Parke, on the grounds that the farmers had a right to\r\nabate the nuisance, and that the commissioner had exceeded his powers\r\nin making this new channel and embankment.\r\n\r\nThis judgment produced a profound impression on the Otmoor farmers\r\nand cottagers. They misread it to mean that all proceedings under\r\nthe Enclosure Act were illegal and therefore null and void, and\r\nthey determined to regain their lost privileges. Disturbances began\r\nat the end of August (28th August). For about a week, straggling\r\nparties of enthusiasts paraded the moor, cutting down fences here\r\nand there. A son of Sir Alexander Croke came out to one of these\r\nparties and ordered them to desist. He had a loaded pistol with him,\r\nand the moor-men, thinking, rightly or wrongly, that he was going to\r\nfire, wrested it from him and gave him a severe thrashing. Matters\r\nbegan to look serious: local sympathy with the rioters was so strong\r\nthat special constables refused to be sworn in; the High Sheriff\r\naccordingly summoned the Oxfordshire Militia, and Lord Churchill’s\r\ntroop of Yeomanry Cavalry was sent to Islip. But the inhabitants were\r\nnot overawed. They determined to perambulate the bounds of Otmoor\r\nin full force, in accordance with the old custom. On Monday, 6th\r\nSeptember, five hundred men, women and children assembled from the\r\nOtmoor towns, and they were joined by five hundred more from elsewhere.\r\nArmed with reap-hooks, hatchets, bill-hooks and duckets, they marched\r\nin order round the seven-mile-long boundary of Otmoor, destroying\r\nall the fences on their way. By noon their work of destruction was\r\nfinished. ‘A farmer in the neighbourhood who witnessed the scene gives\r\na ludicrous description of the zeal and perseverance of the women\r\nand children as well as the men, and the ease and composure with\r\nwhich they waded through depths of mud and water and overcame every\r\nobstacle in their march. He adds that he did not hear any threatening\r\nexpressions against any person or his property, and he does not believe\r\nany individuals present entertained any feeling or wish beyond the\r\nassertion of what they conceived (whether correctly or erroneously) to\r\nbe their prescriptive and inalienable right, and of which they speak\r\nprecisely as the freemen of Oxford would describe their right to Port\r\nMeadow.’[120]\r\n\r\nBy the time the destruction of fences was complete, Lord Churchill’s\r\ntroop of yeomanry came up to the destroying band: the Riot Act was\r\nread, but the moormen refused to disperse. Sixty or seventy of them\r\nwere thereupon seized and examined, with the result that forty-four\r\nwere sent off to Oxford Gaol in wagons, under an escort of yeomanry.\r\nNow it happened to be the day of St. Giles’ Fair, and the street of\r\nSt. Giles, along which the yeomanry brought their prisoners, was\r\ncrowded with countryfolk and townsfolk, most of whom held strong views\r\non the Otmoor question. The men in the wagons raised the cry ‘Otmoor\r\nfor ever,’ the crowd took it up, and attacked the yeomen with great\r\nviolence, hurling brickbats, stones and sticks at them from every side.\r\nThe yeomen managed to get their prisoners as far as the turning down\r\nBeaumont Street, but there they were overpowered, and all forty-four\r\nprisoners escaped. At Otmoor itself peace now reigned. Through the\r\nbroken fences cattle were turned in to graze on all the enclosures,\r\nand the villagers even appointed a herdsman to look after them. The\r\ninhabitants of the seven Otmoor towns formed an association called\r\n‘the Otmoor Association,’ which boldly declared that ‘the Right of\r\nCommon on Otmoor was always in the inhabitants, and that a non-resident\r\nproprietor had no Right of Common thereon,’ and determined to raise\r\nsubscriptions for legal expenses in defence of their right, calling\r\nupon ‘the pecuniary aid of a liberal and benevolent public ... to\r\nassist them in attempting to restore Otmoor once more to its original\r\nstate.’[121]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the authorities who had lost their prisoners once, sent down\r\na stronger force to take them next time, and although at the Oxford\r\nCity Sessions a bill of indictment against William Price and others\r\nfor riot in St. Giles and rescue of the prisoners was thrown out, at\r\nthe County Sessions the Grand Jury found a true Bill against the same\r\nWilliam Price and others for the same offence, and also against Cooper\r\nand others for riot at Otmoor. The prisoners were tried at the Oxford\r\nAssizes next month, before Mr. Justice Bosanquet and Sir John Patteson.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict which shows the strength of public opinion.\r\n‘We find the defendants guilty of having been present at an unlawful\r\nassembly on the 6th September at Otmoor, but it is the unanimous wish\r\nof the Jury to recommend all the parties to the merciful consideration\r\nof the Court.’ The judges responded to this appeal and the longest\r\nsentence inflicted was four months’ imprisonment.[122]\r\n\r\nThe original enclosure was now fifteen years old, but Otmoor was\r\nstill in rebellion, and the Home Office Papers of the next two years\r\ncontain frequent applications for troops from Lord Macclesfield,\r\nLord-Lieutenant, Sir Alexander Croke and other magistrates. Whenever\r\nthere was a full moon, the patriots of the moor turned out and pulled\r\ndown the fences. How strong was the local resentment of the overriding\r\nof all the rights and traditions of the commoners may be seen not\r\nonly from the language of one magistrate writing to Lord Melbourne\r\nin January 1832: ‘all the towns in the neighbourhood of Otmoor are\r\nmore or less infected with the feelings of the most violent, and\r\ncannot at all be depended on’: but also from a resolution passed by\r\nthe magistrates at Oxford in February of that year, declaring that no\r\nconstabulary force that the magistrates could raise would be equal to\r\nsuppressing the Otmoor outrages, and asking for soldiers. The appeal\r\nended with this significant warning: ‘Any force which Government may\r\nsend down should not remain for a length of time together, but that to\r\navoid the possibility of an undue connexion between the people and the\r\nMilitary, a succession of troops should be observed.’ So long and so\r\nbitter was the civil war roused by an enclosure which Parliament had\r\nsanctioned in absolute disregard of the opinions or the traditions or\r\nthe circumstances of the mass of the people it affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[87] Most private Enclosure Acts provided that if a commissioner died\r\nhis successor was to be somebody not interested in the property.\r\n\r\n[88] Sir John Sinclair complained in 1796 that the Board had not even\r\nthe privilege of franking its letters.--_Annals of Agriculture_, vol.\r\nxxvi, p. 506.\r\n\r\n[89] Vol. xxvi. p. 85.\r\n\r\n[90] From the Select Committee on the Means of Facilitating Enclosures\r\nin 1800, reprinted in _Annual Register_, 1800, Appendix to Chronicle,\r\np. 85 ff., we learn that the fees received alone in the House of\r\nCommons (Bill fees, small fees, committee fees, housekeepers’ and\r\nmessengers’ fees, and engrossing fees) for 707 Bills during the\r\nfourteen years from 1786 to 1799 inclusive amounted to no less than\r\n£59,867, 6s. 4d. As the scale of fees in the House of Lords was about\r\nthe same (Bill fees, yeoman, usher, door-keepers’ fees, order of\r\ncommittee, and committee fees) during these years about £120,000 must\r\nhave gone into the pockets of Parliamentary officials.\r\n\r\n[91] See Appendix A (5).\r\n\r\n[92] _Bedford Report_, 1808, p. 235.\r\n\r\n[93] _Annual Register_, 1799, Chron., p. 27.\r\n\r\n[94] Eden, 1.

Keep all in temper--let no rights be\r\nnow disputed.... It is far more easy to prevent a clamour than to stop\r\nit when once it is raised. Those who are acquainted with the business\r\nof inclosure must know that there are more than four-fifths of the\r\ninhabitants in most neighbourhoods who are generally left out of the\r\nbill for want of property, and therefore cannot possibly claim any part\r\nthereof.’\r\n\r\n[96] Vol. xx. p. 456.\r\n\r\n[97] Vol. xxiv. p. 543.\r\n\r\n[98] _The Appropriation and Enclosure of Commonable and Intermixed\r\nLands_, 1801.\r\n\r\n[99] ‘Allow to the cottager a little land about his dwelling for\r\nkeeping a cow, for planting potatoes, for raising flax or hemp.\r\n2ndly, Convert the waste lands of the kingdom into _small_ arable\r\nfarms, a certain quantity every year, to be let on favourable\r\nterms to industrious families. 3rdly, Restrain the engrossment and\r\nover-enlargement of farms.

But it\r\nhad one great permanent result which the rulers of England ignored. The\r\nanchorage of the poor was gone.\r\n\r\nFor enclosure was fatal to three classes: the small farmer, the\r\ncottager, and the squatter. To all of these classes their common rights\r\nwere worth more than anything they received in return. Their position\r\nwas just the opposite of that of the lord of the manor. The lord of the\r\nmanor was given a certain quantity of land (the conventional proportion\r\nwas one-sixteenth[123]) in lieu of his surface rights, and that compact\r\nallotment was infinitely more valuable than the rights so compensated.\r\nSimilarly the tithe-owner stood to gain with the increased rent. The\r\nlarge farmer’s interests were also in enclosure, which gave him a wider\r\nfield for his capital and enterprise. The other classes stood to lose.\r\n\r\nFor even if the small farmer received strict justice in the division\r\nof the common fields, his share in the legal costs and the additional\r\nexpense of fencing his own allotments often overwhelmed him, and he\r\nwas obliged to sell his property.[124] The expenses were always very\r\nheavy, and in some cases amounted to £5 an acre.[125] The lord of the\r\nmanor and the tithe-owner could afford to bear their share, because\r\nthey were enriched by enclosure: the classes that were impoverished by\r\nenclosure were ruined when they had to pay for the very proceeding that\r\nhad made them the poorer. The promoter of the General Enclosure Bill of\r\n1796, it will be remembered, had proposed to exempt the poor from the\r\nexpense of fencing, but the Select Committee disapproved, and the only\r\npersons exempted in the cases we have examined were the lords of the\r\nmanor or tithe-owners.\r\n\r\nIf these expenses still left the small farmer on his feet, he found\r\nhimself deprived of the use of the fallow and stubble pasture, which\r\nhad been almost as indispensable to him as the land he cultivated.\r\n‘Strip the small farms of the benefit of the commons,’ said one\r\nobserver, ‘and they are all at one stroke levelled to the ground.’[126]\r\nIt was a common clause in Enclosure Acts that no sheep were to be\r\ndepastured on allotments for seven years.[127] The small farmer either\r\nemigrated to America or to an industrial town, or became a day\r\nlabourer. His fate in the last resort may perhaps be illustrated by\r\nthe account given by the historian of _Oxfordshire_ of the enclosure\r\nof Merton. ‘About the middle of last century a very considerable\r\nalteration was produced in the relative situation of different classes\r\nin the village. The Act of Parliament for the inclosure of the fields\r\nhaving annulled all leases, and the inclosure itself facilitated the\r\nplan of throwing several small farms into a few large bargains,[128]\r\nthe holders of the farms who had heretofore lived in comparative\r\nplenty, became suddenly reduced to the situation of labourers, and in\r\na few years were necessitated to throw themselves and their families\r\nupon the parish. The overgrown farmers who had fattened upon this\r\nalteration, feeling the pressure of the new burden, determined if\r\npossible to free themselves: they accordingly decided upon reducing\r\nthe allowance of these poor to the lowest ratio,[129] and resolved\r\nto have no more servants so that their parishioners might experience\r\nno further increase from that source. In a few years the numbers of\r\nthe poor rapidly declined: the more aged sank into their graves, and\r\nthe youth, warned by their parents’ sufferings, sought a settlement\r\nelsewhere. The farmers, rejoicing in the success of their scheme,\r\nprocured the demolition of the cottages, and thus endeavoured to secure\r\nthemselves and their successors from the future expenses of supporting\r\nan increased population, so that in 1821 the parish numbered only\r\nthirty houses inhabited by thirty-four families.’[130] Another writer\r\ngave an account of the results of a Norfolk enclosure. ‘In passing\r\nthrough a village near Swaffham, in the County of Norfolk a few years\r\nago, to my great mortification I beheld the houses tumbling into ruins,\r\nand the common fields all enclosed; upon enquiring into the cause of\r\nthis melancholy alteration, I was informed that a gentleman of Lynn had\r\nbought that township and the next adjoining to it: that he had thrown\r\nthe one into three, and the other into four farms; which before the\r\nenclosure were in about twenty farms: and upon my further enquiring\r\nwhat was becoming of the farmers who were turned out, the answer was\r\nthat some of them were dead and the rest were become labourers.’[131]\r\n\r\nThe effect on the cottager can best be described by saying that before\r\nenclosure the cottager was a labourer with land, after enclosure he\r\nwas a labourer without land. The economic basis of his independence\r\nwas destroyed. In the first place, he lost a great many rights for\r\nwhich he received no compensation. There were, for instance, the cases\r\nmentioned by Mr. Henry Homer (1719-1791), Rector of Birdingbury and\r\nChaplain to Lord Leigh, in the pamphlet he published in 1769,[132]\r\nwhere the cottagers lost the privileges of cutting furze and turf on\r\nthe common land, the proprietor contending that they had no right to\r\nthese privileges, but only enjoyed them by his indulgence. In every\r\nother case, Mr. Homer urged, uninterrupted, immemorial usage gives a\r\nlegal sanction even to encroachments. ‘Why should the poor, as poor,\r\nbe excluded from the benefit of this general Indulgence; or why should\r\nany set of proprietors avail themselves of the inability of the poor to\r\ncontend with them, to get possession of more than they enjoyed?’[133]\r\n\r\nAnother right that was often lost was the prescriptive right of keeping\r\na cow. The _General Report on Enclosures_ (p. 12) records the results\r\nof a careful inquiry made in a journey of 1600 miles, which showed that\r\nbefore enclosure cottagers often kept cows without a legal right, and\r\nthat nothing was given them for the practice. Other cottagers kept cows\r\nby right of hiring their cottages and common rights, and on enclosure\r\nthe land was thrown into a farm, and the cottager had to sell his\r\ncow. Two examples taken from the _Bedfordshire Report_ illustrate the\r\nconsequences of enclosure to the small man. One is from Maulden:[134]\r\n‘The common was very extensive. I conversed with a farmer, and several\r\ncottagers. One of them said, enclosing would ruin England; it was worse\r\nthan ten wars. Why, my friend, what have you lost by it? _I kept four\r\ncows before the parish was enclosed, and now I don’t keep so much as\r\na goose; and you ask me what I lose by it!_’[135] The other is from\r\nSandy:[136] ‘This parish was very peculiarly circumstanced; it abounds\r\nwith gardeners, many cultivating their little freeholds, so that on\r\nthe enclosure, there were found to be sixty-three proprietors, though\r\nnine-tenths, perhaps, of the whole belonged to Sir P. Monoux and Mr.\r\nPym. These men kept cows on the boggy common, and cut fern for litter\r\non the warren, by which means they were enabled to raise manure for\r\ntheir gardens, besides fuel in plenty: the small allotment of an\r\nacre and a half, however good the land, has been no compensation for\r\nwhat they were deprived of. They complain heavily, and know not how\r\nthey will now manage to raise manure. This was no reason to preserve\r\nthe deserts in their old state, but an ample one for giving a full\r\ncompensation.’\r\n\r\nLord Winchilsea stated in his letter to the Board of Agriculture in\r\n1796: ‘Whoever travels through the Midland Counties and will take the\r\ntrouble of inquiring, will generally receive for answer that formerly\r\nthere were a great many cottagers who kept cows, but that the land is\r\nnow thrown to the farmers, and if he inquires still further, he will\r\nfind that in those parishes the Poor Rates have increased in an amazing\r\ndegree more than according to the average rise throughout England.’\r\n\r\nThese cottagers often received nothing at all for the right they had\r\nlost, the compensation going to the owner of the cottage only. But even\r\nthose cottagers who owned their cottage received in return for their\r\ncommon right something infinitely less valuable. For a tiny allotment\r\nwas worth much less than a common right, especially if the allotment\r\nwas at a distance from their cottage, and though the Haute Huntre Act\r\nbinds the commissioners to give Lord FitzWilliam an allotment near\r\nhis gardens, there was nothing in any Act that we have seen to oblige\r\nthe commissioners to give the cottager an allotment at his door. And\r\nthe cottagers had to fence their allotments or forfeit them. Anybody\r\nwho glances at an award will understand what this meant. It is easy,\r\nfor example, to imagine what happened under this provision to the\r\nfollowing cottagers at Stanwell: Edmund Jordan (1-1/2 acres) J. and\r\nF. Ride (each 1-1/4 acres) T. L. Rogers (1-1/4 acres) Brooker Derby\r\n(1-1/4) Mary Gulliver (1-1/4 acres) Anne Higgs (1-1/4) H. Isherwood\r\n(1-1/4) William Kent (1-1/4) Elizabeth Carr (1 acre) Thomas Nash (1\r\nacre) R. Ride (just under 1 acre) William Robinson (just under 1 acre)\r\nWilliam Cox (3/4 acre) John Carter (3/4 acre) William Porter (3/4 acre)\r\nThomas King (1/2 acre) John Hetherington (under 1/2 an acre) J. Trout\r\n(1/4 acre and 4 perches) and Charles Burkhead (12 perches). It would be\r\ninteresting to know how many of these small parcels of land found their\r\nway into the hands of Sir William Gibbons and Mr. Edmund Hill.\r\n\r\nThe Louth award is still more interesting from this point of view.\r\nJ. Trout and Charles Burkhead passing rich, the one on 1/4 acre and\r\n4 perches, the other on 12 perches, had only to pay their share of\r\nthe expenses of the enclosure, and for their own fencing. Sir William\r\nGibbons was too magnanimous a man to ask them to fence his 500 acres\r\nas well. But at Louth the tithe-owners, who took more than a third of\r\nthe whole, were excused their share of the costs, and also had their\r\nfencing done for them by the other proprietors. The prebendary and the\r\nvicar charged the expenses of fencing their 600 acres on persons like\r\nElizabeth Bryan who went off with 39 perches, Ann Dunn (35 perches),\r\nNaomi Hodgson, widow (35 perches), John Betts (34 perches), Elizabeth\r\nAtkins (32 perches), Will Boswell (31 perches), Elizabeth Eycon (28\r\nperches), Ann Hubbard, widow (15 perches), and Ann Metcalf, whose share\r\nof the spoil was 14 perches. The award shows that there were 67 persons\r\nwho received an acre or less. Cottagers who received such allotments\r\nand had to fence them had no alternative but to sell, and little to do\r\nwith the money but to drink it. This is the testimony of the _General\r\nReport on Enclosures_.[137]\r\n\r\nThe squatters, though they are often spoken of as cottagers, must be\r\ndistinguished from the cottager in regard to their legal and historical\r\nposition. They were in a sense outside the original village economy.\r\nThe cottager was, so to speak, an aboriginal poor man: the squatter a\r\npoor alien. He settled on a waste, built a cottage, and got together\r\na few geese or sheep, perhaps even a horse or a cow, and proceeded to\r\ncultivate the ground.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of encroachments seems to have varied very greatly, as\r\nthe cases analysed in the Appendix show, and there was no settled\r\nrule. Squatters of less than twenty years’ standing seldom received\r\nany consideration beyond the privilege of buying their encroachment.\r\nSquatters of more than twenty or forty years’ standing, as the case\r\nmight be, were often allowed to keep their encroachments, and in some\r\ncases were treated like cottagers, with a claim to an allotment. But,\r\nof course, like the cottagers, they lost their common rights.\r\n\r\nLastly, enclosure swept away the bureaucracy of the old village:\r\nthe viewers of fields and letters of the cattle, who had general\r\nsupervision of the arrangements for pasturing sheep or cows in the\r\ncommon meadow, the common shepherd, the chimney peepers who saw that\r\nthe chimneys were kept properly, the hayward, or pinder, who looked\r\nafter the pound. Most of these little officials of the village court\r\nhad been paid either in land or by fees. When it was proposed to\r\nabolish Parliamentary Enclosure, and to substitute a General Enclosure\r\nBill, the Parliamentary officials, who made large sums out of fees from\r\nEnclosure Bills, were to receive compensation; but there was no talk of\r\ncompensation for the stolen livelihood of a pinder or a chimney peeper,\r\nas there had been for the lost pickings of the officials of Parliament,\r\nor as there was whenever an unhappy aristocrat was made to surrender\r\none of his sinecures. George Selwyn, who had been Paymaster of the\r\nWorks for twenty-seven years at the time that Burke’s Act of 1782\r\ndeprived him of that profitable title, was not allowed to languish very\r\nlong on the two sinecures that were left to him. In 1784 Pitt consoled\r\nhim with the lucrative name of Surveyor-General of Crown Lands. The\r\npinder and the viewer received a different kind of justice. For the\r\nrich there is compensation, as the weaver said in Disraeli’s _Sybil_,\r\nbut ‘sympathy is the solace of the poor.’ In this case, if the truth be\r\ntold, even this solace was not administered with too liberal a hand.\r\n\r\nAll these classes and interests were scattered by enclosure, but it\r\nwas not one generation alone that was struck down by the blow. For\r\nthe commons were the patrimony of the poor. The commoner’s child,\r\nhowever needy, was born with a spoon in his mouth. He came into a world\r\nin which he had a share and a place. The civilisation which was now\r\nsubmerged had spelt a sort of independence for the obscure lineage of\r\nthe village. It had represented, too, the importance of the interest of\r\nthe community in its soil, and in this aspect also the robbery of the\r\npresent was less important than the robbery of the future. For one act\r\nof confiscation blotted out a principle of permanent value to the State.\r\n\r\nThe immediate consequences of this policy were only partially visible\r\nto the governing or the cultivated classes. The rulers of England\r\ntook it for granted that the losses of individuals were the gains of\r\nthe State, and that the distresses of the poor were the condition of\r\npermanent advance. Modern apologists have adopted the same view; and\r\nthe popular resistance to enclosure is often compared to the wild and\r\npassionate fury that broke against the spinning and weaving machines,\r\nthe symbols and engines of the Industrial Revolution. History has drawn\r\na curtain over those days of exile and suffering, when cottages were\r\npulled down as if by an invader’s hand, and families that had lived\r\nfor centuries in their dales or on their small farms and commons were\r\ndriven before the torrent, losing\r\n\r\n    ‘Estate and house ... and all their sheep,\r\n    A pretty flock, and which for aught I know\r\n    Had clothed the Ewbanks for a thousand years.’\r\n\r\nAncient possessions and ancient families disappeared. But the first\r\nconsequence was not the worst consequence: so far from compensating\r\nfor this misery, the ultimate result was still more disastrous. The\r\ngoverning class killed by this policy the spirit of a race. The\r\npetitions that are buried with their brief and unavailing pathos in\r\nthe _Journals_ of the House of Commons are the last voice of village\r\nindependence, and the unnamed commoners who braved the dangers of\r\nresistance to send their doomed protests to the House of Commons that\r\nobeyed their lords, were the last of the English peasants. These were\r\nthe men, it is not unreasonable to believe, whom Gray had in mind when\r\nhe wrote:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Some village Hampden that with dauntless breast\r\n    The little tyrant of his fields withstood.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs we read the descriptions of the state of France before the\r\nRevolution, there is one fact that comforts the imagination and braces\r\nthe heart. We read of the intolerable services of the peasant, of\r\nhis forced labour, his confiscated harvests, his crushing burdens,\r\nhis painful and humiliating tasks, including in some cases even the\r\nduty of protecting the sleep of the seigneur from the croaking of\r\nthe neighbouring marshes. The mind of Arthur Young was filled with\r\nthis impression of unsupportable servitude. But a more discerning eye\r\nmight have perceived a truth that escaped the English traveller. It\r\nis contained in an entry that often greets us in the official reports\r\non the state of the provinces: _ce seigneur litige avec ses vassaux_.\r\nThose few words flash like a gleam of the dawn across this sombre\r\nand melancholy page. The peasant may be overwhelmed by the dîme,\r\nthe taille, the corvée, the hundred and one services that knit his\r\ntenure to the caprice of a lord: he may be wretched, brutal, ignorant,\r\nill-clothed, ill-fed, and ill-housed: but he has not lost his status:\r\nhe is not a casual figure in a drifting proletariat: he belongs to a\r\ncommunity that can withstand the seigneur, dispute his claims at law,\r\nresume its rights, recover its possessions, and establish, one day, its\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nIn England the aristocracy destroyed the promise of such a development\r\nwhen it broke the back of the peasant community. The enclosures\r\ncreated a new organisation of classes. The peasant with rights and a\r\nstatus, with a share in the fortunes and government of his village,\r\nstanding in rags, but standing on his feet, makes way for the labourer\r\nwith no corporate rights to defend, no corporate power to invoke, no\r\nproperty to cherish, no ambition to pursue, bent beneath the fear of\r\nhis masters, and the weight of a future without hope. No class in the\r\nworld has so beaten and crouching a history, and if the blazing ricks\r\nin 1830 once threatened his rulers with the anguish of his despair, in\r\nno chapter of that history could it have been written, ‘This parish is\r\nat law with its squire.’ For the parish was no longer the community\r\nthat offered the labourer friendship and sheltered his freedom: it was\r\nmerely the shadow of his poverty, his helplessness, and his shame.\r\n‘Go to an ale-house kitchen of an old enclosed country, and there you\r\nwill see the origin of poverty and poor-rates. For whom are they to be\r\nsober? For whom are they to save? For the parish? If I am diligent,\r\nshall I have leave to build a cottage? If I am sober, shall I have\r\nland for a cow? If I am frugal, shall I have half an acre of potatoes?\r\nYou offer no motives; you have nothing but a parish officer and a\r\nworkhouse!--Bring me another pot--.’[138]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[123] See the Evidence of Witnesses before the Committee on Commons\r\nInclosure of 1844. (Baily, land-agent): ‘General custom to give the\r\nLord of Manor 1/16th as compensation for his rights exclusive of the\r\nvalue of minerals and of his rights as a common right owner.’ Another\r\nwitness (Coulson, a solicitor) defined the surface rights as ‘game and\r\nstockage,’ and said that the proportion determined upon was the result\r\nof a bargain beforehand.\r\n\r\n[124] ‘Many small proprietors have been seriously injured by being\r\nobliged in pursuance of ill-framed private bills to enclose lands which\r\nnever repaid the expense.’ Marshall, _The Appropriation and Enclosure\r\nof Commonable and Intermixed Lands_, 1801, p. 52.\r\n\r\n[125] COST OF ENCLOSURE.--The expenses of particular Acts varied very\r\nmuch. Billingsley in his _Report on Somerset_ (p. 57) gives £3 an acre\r\nas the cost of enclosing a lowland parish, £2, 10s. for an upland\r\nparish. The enclosure of the 12,000 acre King’s Sedgmoor (_Ibid._, p.\r\n196) came (with the subdivisions) to no less than £59,624, 4s. 8d.,\r\nor nearly £5 an acre. Stanwell Enclosure, on the other hand, came to\r\nabout 23s. an acre, and various instances given in the _Report for\r\nBedfordshire_ work out at about the same figure. When the allotments\r\nto the tithe-owners and the lord of the manor were exempted, the sum\r\nper acre would of course fall more heavily on the other allottees,\r\n_e.g._ of Louth, where more than a third of the 1701 acres enclosed\r\nwere exempt. In many cases, of course, land was sold to cover expenses.\r\nThe cost of fencing allotments would also vary in different localities.\r\nIn Somerset, from 7s. 7d. to 8s. 7d. for 20 feet of quickset hedge was\r\ncalculated, in Bedfordshire, 10s. 6d. per pole.

His livelihood was made up from various\r\nsources. His firing he took from the waste, he had a cow or a pig\r\nwandering on the common pasture, perhaps he raised a little crop on a\r\nstrip in the common fields. He was not merely a wage earner, receiving\r\nso much money a week or a day for his labour, and buying all the\r\nnecessaries of life at a shop: he received wages as a labourer, but in\r\npart he maintained himself as a producer. Further, the actual money\r\nrevenue of the family was not limited to the labourer’s earnings, for\r\nthe domestic industries that flourished in the village gave employment\r\nto his wife and children.\r\n\r\nIn an enclosed village at the end of the eighteenth century the\r\nposition of the agricultural labourer was very different. All his\r\nauxiliary resources had been taken from him, and he was now a wage\r\nearner and nothing more. Enclosure had robbed him of the strip that he\r\ntilled, of the cow that he kept on the village pasture, of the fuel\r\nthat he picked up in the woods, and of the turf that he tore from the\r\ncommon. And while a social revolution had swept away his possessions,\r\nan industrial revolution had swept away his family’s earnings. To\r\nfamilies living on the scale of the village poor, each of these losses\r\nwas a crippling blow, and the total effect of the changes was to\r\ndestroy their economic independence.\r\n\r\nSome of these auxiliary resources were not valued very highly by\r\nthe upper classes, and many champions of enclosure proved to their\r\nown satisfaction that the advantage, for example, of the right of\r\ncutting fuel was quite illusory. Such writers had a very superficial\r\nknowledge of the lot of the cottagers. They argued that it would be\r\nmore economical for the labourer to spend on his ordinary employment\r\nthe time he devoted to cutting fuel and turf, and to buy firing out of\r\nhis wages: an argument from the theory of the division of labour that\r\nassumed that employment was constant. Fortunately we have, thanks to\r\nDavies, a very careful calculation that enables us to form rather a\r\ncloser judgment. He estimates[139] that a man could cut nearly enough\r\nin a week to serve his family all the year, and as the farmers will\r\ngive the carriage of it in return for the ashes, he puts the total\r\ncost at 10s. a year, or a little more than a week’s wages.[140] If we\r\ncompare this with his accounts of the cost of fuel elsewhere, we soon\r\nsee how essential common fuel rights were to a labourer’s economy.\r\nAt Sidlesham in Surrey, for instance,[141] in the expenses of five\r\nfamilies of labourers, the fuel varies from £1, 15s. 0d. up to £4, 3s.\r\n0d., with an average of £2, 8s. 0d. per family. It must be remembered,\r\ntoo, that the sum of 10s. for fuel from the common is calculated on\r\nthe assumption that the man would otherwise be working; whereas, in\r\nreality, he could cut his turf in slack times and in odd hours, when\r\nthere was no money to be made by working for some one else.\r\n\r\nThere was another respect in which the resources of a labouring family\r\nwere diminished towards the end of the century, and this too was a\r\nloss that the rich thought trifling. From time immemorial the labourer\r\nhad sent his wife and children into the fields to glean or leaze\r\nafter the harvest. The profits of gleaning, under the old, unimproved\r\nsystem of agriculture, were very considerable. Eden says of Rode in\r\nNorthamptonshire, where agriculture was in a ‘wretched state, from the\r\nland being in common-fields,’ that ‘several families will gather as\r\nmuch wheat as will serve them for bread the whole year, and as many\r\nbeans as will keep a pig.’[142] From this point of view enclosure, with\r\nits improved methods of agriculture, meant a sensible loss to the poor\r\nof the parish, but even when there was less to be gleaned the privilege\r\nwas by no means unimportant. A correspondent in the _Annals of\r\nAgriculture_,[143] writing evidently of land under improved cultivation\r\nin Shropshire, estimates that a wife can glean three or four bushels.\r\nThe consumption of wheat, exclusive of other food, by a labourer’s\r\nfamily he puts at half a bushel a week at least; the price of wheat at\r\n13s. 6d. a bushel; the labourer’s wages at 7s. or 8s. To such a family\r\ngleaning rights represented the equivalent of some six or seven weeks’\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of large farming these customary rights were\r\nin danger. It was a nuisance for the farmer to have his fenced fields\r\nsuddenly invaded by bands of women and children. The ears to be\r\npicked up were now few and far between, and there was a risk that\r\nthe labourers, husbands and fathers of the gleaners, might wink at\r\nsmall thefts from the sheaves. Thus it was that customary rights,\r\nwhich had never been questioned before, and seemed to go back to\r\nthe Bible itself, came to be the subject of dispute. On the whole\r\nquestion of gleaning there is an animated controversy in the _Annals of\r\nAgriculture_[144] between Capel Lofft,[145] a romantic Suffolk Liberal,\r\nwho took the side of the gleaners, and Ruggles,[146] the historian,\r\nwho argued against them. Capel Lofft was a humane and chivalrous\r\nmagistrate who, unfortunately for the Suffolk poor, was struck off the\r\nCommission of the Peace a few years later, apparently at the instance\r\nof the Duke of Portland, for persuading the Deputy-Sheriff to postpone\r\nthe execution of a girl sentenced to death for stealing, until he had\r\npresented a memorial to the Crown praying for clemency. The chief\r\narguments on the side of the gleaners were (1) that immemorial custom\r\ngave legal right, according to the maxim, _consuetudo angliae lex est\r\nangliae communis_; (2) that Blackstone had recognised the right in\r\nhis _Commentaries_, basing his opinion upon Hale and Gilbert, ‘Also\r\nit hath been said, that by the common law and customs of England the\r\npoor are allowed to enter and glean on another’s ground after harvest\r\nwithout being guilty of trespass, which humane provision seems borrowed\r\nfrom the Mosaic law’ (iii. 212, 1st edition); (3) that in Ireland the\r\nright was recognised by statutes of Henry VIII.’s reign, which modified\r\nit; (4) that it was a custom that helped to keep the poor free from\r\ndegrading dependence on poor relief. It was argued, on the other hand,\r\nby those who denied the right to glean, that though the custom had\r\nexisted from time immemorial, it did not rest on any basis of actual\r\nright, and that no legal sanction to it had ever been explicitly given,\r\nBlackstone and the authorities on whom he relied being too vague to be\r\nconsidered final. Further, the custom was demoralising to the poor;\r\nit led to idleness, ‘how many days during the harvest are lost by the\r\nmother of a family and all her children, in wandering about from field\r\nto field, to glean what does not repay them the wear of their cloathes\r\nin seeking’; it led to pilfering from the temptation to take handfuls\r\nfrom the swarth or shock; and it was deplorable that on a good-humoured\r\npermission should be grafted ‘a legal claim, in its use and exercise so\r\nnearly approaching to licentiousness.’\r\n\r\nWhilst this controversy was going on, the legal question was decided\r\nagainst the poor by a majority of judges in the Court of Common Pleas\r\nin 1788. One judge, Sir Henry Gould,[147] dissented in a learned\r\njudgment; the majority based their decision partly on the mischievous\r\nconsequences of the practice to the poor. The poor never lost a right\r\nwithout being congratulated by the rich on gaining something better.\r\nIt did not, of course, follow from this decision that the practice\r\nnecessarily ceased altogether, but from that time it was a privilege\r\ngiven by the farmer at his own discretion, and he could warn off\r\nobnoxious or ‘saucy’ persons from his fields. Moreover, the dearer the\r\ncorn, and the more important the privilege for the poor, the more the\r\nfarmer was disinclined to largess the precious ears. Capel Lofft had\r\npleaded that with improved agriculture the gleaners could pick up so\r\nlittle that that little should not be grudged, but the farmer found\r\nthat under famine prices this little was worth more to him than the\r\ncareless scatterings of earlier times.[148]\r\n\r\nThe loss of his cow and his produce and his common and traditional\r\nrights was rendered particularly serious to the labourer by the general\r\ngrowth of prices. For enclosure which had produced the agrarian\r\nproletariat, had raised the cost of living for him. The accepted\r\nopinion that under enclosure England became immensely more productive\r\ntends to obscure the truth that the agricultural labourer suffered in\r\nhis character of consumer, as well as in his character of producer,\r\nwhen the small farms and the commons disappeared. Not only had he to\r\nbuy the food that formerly he had produced himself, but he had to buy\r\nit in a rising market. Adam Smith admitted that the rise of price of\r\npoultry and pork had been accelerated by enclosure, and Nathaniel\r\nKent laid stress on the diminution in the supply of these and other\r\nsmall provisions. Kent has described the change in the position of\r\nthe labourers in this respect: ‘Formerly they could buy milk, butter,\r\nand many other small articles in every parish, in whatever quantity\r\nthey are wanted. But since small farms have decreased in number, no\r\nsuch articles are to be had; for the great farmers have no idea of\r\nretailing such small commodities, and those who do retail them carry\r\nthem all to town. A farmer is even unwilling to sell the labourer who\r\nworks for him a bushel of wheat, which he might get ground for three\r\nor four pence a bushel. For want of this advantage he is driven to the\r\nmealman or baker, who, in the ordinary course of their profit, get\r\nat least ten per cent. of them, upon this principal article of their\r\nconsumption.’[149] Davies, the author of _The Case of Labourers in\r\nHusbandry_, thus describes the new method of distribution: ‘The great\r\nfarmer deals in a wholesale way with the miller: the miller with the\r\nmealman: the mealman with the shopkeeper, of which last the poor man\r\nbuys his flour by the bushel. For neither the miller nor the mealman\r\nwill sell the labourer a less quantity than a sack of flour, under the\r\nretail price of shops, and the poor man’s pocket will seldom allow of\r\nhis buying a whole sack at once.’[150]\r\n\r\nIt is clear from these facts that it would have needed a very large\r\nincrease of wages to compensate the labourer for his losses under\r\nenclosure. But real wages, instead of rising, had fallen, and fallen\r\nfar. The writer of the _Bedfordshire Report_ (p. 67), comparing the\r\nperiod of 1730-50 with that of 1802-6 in respect of prices of wheat\r\nand labour, points out that to enable him to purchase equal quantities\r\nof bread in the second period and in the first, the pay of the day\r\nlabourer in the second period should have been 2s. a day, whereas it\r\nwas 1s. 6d. Nathaniel Kent, writing in 1796,[151] says that in the last\r\nforty or fifty years the price of provisions had gone up by 60 per\r\ncent., and wages by 25 per cent., ‘but this is not all, for the sources\r\nof the market which used to feed him are in a great measure cut off\r\nsince the system of large farms has been so much encouraged.’ Professor\r\nLevy estimates that wages rose between 1760 and 1813 by 60 per cent.,\r\nand the price of wheat by 130 per cent.[152] Thus the labourer who now\r\nlived on wages alone earned wages of a lower purchasing power than the\r\nwages which he had formerly supplemented by his own produce. Whereas\r\nhis condition earlier in the century had been contrasted with that of\r\nContinental peasants greatly to his advantage in respect of quantity\r\nand variety of food, he was suddenly brought down to the barest\r\nnecessities of life. Arthur Young had said a generation earlier that\r\nin France bread formed nineteen parts in twenty of the food of the\r\npeople, but that in England all ranks consumed an immense quantity of\r\nmeat, butter and cheese.[153] We know something of the manner of life\r\nof the poor in 1789 and 1795 from the family budgets collected by Eden\r\nand Davies from different parts of the country.[154] These budgets\r\nshow that the labourers were rapidly sinking in this respect to the\r\ncondition that Young had described as the condition of the poor in\r\nFrance. ‘Bacon and other kinds of meat form a very small part of their\r\ndiet, and cheese becomes a luxury.’ But even on the meagre food that\r\nnow became the ordinary fare of the cottage, the labourers could not\r\nmake ends meet. All the budgets tell the same tale of impoverished diet\r\naccompanied by an overwhelming strain and an actual deficit. The normal\r\nlabourer, even with constant employment, was no longer solvent.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to understand fully the predicament of the labourer, we\r\nmust remember that he was not free to roam over England, and try his\r\nluck in some strange village or town when his circumstances became\r\ndesperate at home. He lived under the capricious tyranny of the old law\r\nof settlement, and enclosure had made that net a much more serious fact\r\nfor the poor. The destruction of the commons had deprived him of any\r\ncareer within his own village; the Settlement Laws barred his escape\r\nout of it. It is worth while to consider what the Settlement Laws were,\r\nand how they acted, and as the subject is not uncontroversial it will\r\nbe necessary to discuss it in some detail.\r\n\r\nTheoretically every person had one parish, and one only, in which he\r\nor she had a settlement and a right to parish relief. In practice it\r\nwas often difficult to decide which parish had the duty of relief,\r\nand disputes gave rise to endless litigation. From this point of view\r\neighteenth-century England was like a chessboard of parishes, on which\r\nthe poor were moved about like pawns. The foundation of the various\r\nlaws on the subject was an Act passed in Charles II.’s reign (13 and\r\n14 Charles II. c. 12) in 1662. Before this Act each parish had, it\r\nis true, the duty of relieving its own impotent poor and of policing\r\nits own vagrants, and the infirm and aged were enjoined by law to\r\nbetake themselves to their place of settlement, which might be their\r\nbirthplace, or the place where they had lived for three years, but, as\r\na rule, ‘a poor family might, without the fear of being sent back by\r\nthe parish officers, go where they choose, for better wages, or more\r\ncertain employment.’[155] This Act of 1662 abridged their liberty,\r\nand, in place of the old vagueness, established a new and elaborate\r\nsystem. The Act was declared to be necessary in the preamble, because\r\n‘by reason of some defects in the law, poor people are not restrained\r\nfrom going from one parish to another, and therefore do endeavour to\r\nsettle themselves in those parishes where there is the best stock,\r\nthe largest commons or wastes to build cottages, and the most woods\r\nfor them to burn and destroy; and when they have consumed it, then\r\nto another parish; and at last become rogues and vagabonds; to the\r\ngreat discouragement of parishes to provide stock, when it is liable\r\nto be devoured by strangers.’ By the Act any new-comer, within forty\r\ndays of arrival, could be ejected from a parish by an order from the\r\nmagistrates, upon complaint from the parish officers, and removed to\r\nthe parish where he or she was last legally settled. If, however, the\r\nnew-comer settled in a tenement of the yearly value of £10, or could\r\ngive security for the discharge of the parish to the magistrates’\r\nsatisfaction, he was exempt from this provision.\r\n\r\nAs this Act carried with it the consequence that forty days’ residence\r\nwithout complaint from the parish officers gained the new-comer a\r\nsettlement, it was an inevitable temptation to Parish A to smuggle its\r\npoor into Parish B, where forty days’ residence without the knowledge\r\nof the parish officers would gain them a settlement. Fierce quarrels\r\nbroke out between the parishes in consequence. To compose these it\r\nwas enacted (1 James II. c. 17) that the forty days’ residence were\r\nto be reckoned only after a written notice had been given to a parish\r\nofficer. Even this was not enough to protect Parish B, and by 3 William\r\nand Mary, c. 11 (1691) it was provided that this notice must be read in\r\nchurch, immediately after divine service, and then registered in the\r\nbook kept for poor’s accounts. Such a condition made it practically\r\nimpossible for any poor man to gain a settlement by forty days’\r\nresidence, unless his tenement were of the value of £10 a year, but\r\nthe Act allowed an immigrant to obtain a settlement in any one of four\r\nways; (1) by paying the parish taxes; (2) by executing a public annual\r\noffice in the parish; (3) by serving an apprenticeship in the parish;\r\n(4) by being hired for a year’s service in the parish. (This, however,\r\nonly applied to the unmarried.) In 1697 (8 and 9 William III. c. 30)\r\na further important modification of the settlement laws was made.\r\nTo prevent the arbitrary ejection of new-comers by parish officers,\r\nwho feared that the fresh arrival or his children might somehow or\r\nother gain a settlement, it was enacted that if the new-comer brought\r\nwith him to Parish B a certificate from the parish officers of\r\nParish A taking responsibility for him, then he could not be removed\r\ntill he became actually chargeable. It was further decided by this\r\nand subsequent Acts and by legal decisions, that the granting of a\r\ncertificate was to be left to the discretion of the parish officers and\r\nmagistrates, that the cost of removal fell on the certificating parish,\r\nand that a certificate holder could only gain a settlement in a new\r\nparish by renting a tenement of £10 annual value, or by executing a\r\nparish office, and that his apprentice or hired servant could not gain\r\na settlement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these methods of gaining a settlement there were four\r\nother ways, ‘through which,’ according to Eden, ‘it is probable\r\nthat by far the greater part of the labouring Poor ... are actually\r\nsettled.’[156] (1) Bastards, with some exceptions, acquired a\r\nsettlement by birth[157]; (2) legitimate children also acquired a\r\nsettlement by birth if their father’s, or failing that, their mother’s\r\nlegal settlement was not known; (3) women gained a settlement by\r\nmarriage; (4) persons with an estate of their own were irremovable, if\r\nresiding on it, however small it might be.\r\n\r\nVery few important modifications had been made in the laws of\r\nSettlement during the century after 1697. In 1722 (9 George I. c. 7) it\r\nwas provided that no person was to obtain a settlement in any parish by\r\nthe purchase of any estate or interest of less value than £30, to be\r\n‘bona fide paid,’ a provision which suggests that parishes had connived\r\nat gifts of money for the purchase of estates in order to discard\r\ntheir paupers: by the same Act the payment of the scavenger or highway\r\nrate was declared not to confer a settlement. In 1784 (24 George III.\r\nc. 6) soldiers, sailors and their families were allowed to exercise\r\ntrades where they liked, and were not to be removable till they became\r\nactually chargeable; and in 1793 (33 George III. c. 54) this latter\r\nconcession was extended to members of Friendly Societies. None of these\r\nconcessions affected the normal labourer, and down to 1795 a labourer\r\ncould only make his way to a new village if his own village would give\r\nhim a certificate, or if the other village invited him. His liberty was\r\nentirely controlled by the parish officers.\r\n\r\nHow far did the Settlement Acts operate? How far did this body of\r\nlaw really affect the comfort and liberty of the poor? The fiercest\r\ncriticism comes from Adam Smith, whose fundamental instincts rebelled\r\nagainst so crude and brutal an interference with human freedom. ‘To\r\nremove a man who has committed no misdemeanour, from a parish where\r\nhe chuses to reside, is an evident violation of natural liberty and\r\njustice. The common people of England, however, so jealous of their\r\nliberty, but, like the common people of most other countries, never\r\nrightly understanding wherein it consists, have now, for more than a\r\ncentury together, suffered themselves to be exposed to this oppression\r\nwithout a remedy. Though men of reflexion, too, have sometimes\r\ncomplained of the law of settlements as a public grievance; yet it has\r\nnever been the object of any general popular clamour, such as that\r\nagainst general warrants, an abusive practice undoubtedly, but such\r\na one as was not likely to occasion any general oppression. There is\r\nscarce a poor man in England, of forty years of age, I will venture to\r\nsay, who has not, in some part of his life, felt himself most cruelly\r\noppressed by this ill-contrived law of settlements.’[158]\r\n\r\nAdam Smith’s view is supported by two contemporary writers on the Poor\r\nLaw, Dr. Burn and Mr. Hay. Dr. Burn, who published a history of the\r\nPoor Law in 1764, gives this picture of the overseer: ‘The office of\r\nan Overseer of the Poor seems to be understood to be this, to keep an\r\nextraordinary look-out to prevent persons coming to inhabit without\r\ncertificates, and to fly to the Justices to remove them: and if a man\r\nbrings a certificate, then to caution the inhabitants not to let him\r\na farm of £10 a year, and to take care to keep him out of all parish\r\noffices.’[159] He further says that the parish officers will assist a\r\npoor man in taking a farm in a neighbouring parish, and give him £10\r\nfor the rent. Mr. Hay, M.P., protested in his remarks on the Poor Laws\r\nagainst the hardships inflicted on the poor by the Laws of Settlement.\r\n‘It leaves it in the breast of the parish officers whether they will\r\ngrant a poor person a certificate or no.’[160] Eden, on the other hand,\r\nthought Adam Smith’s picture overdrawn, and he contended that though\r\nthere were no doubt cases of vexatious removal, the Laws of Settlement\r\nwere not administered in this way everywhere. Howlett also considered\r\nthe operation of the Laws of Settlement to be ‘trifling,’ and instanced\r\nthe growth of Sheffield, Birmingham, and Manchester as proof that there\r\nwas little interference with the mobility of labour.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the evidence seems to lead to the conclusion that\r\nthe Laws of Settlement were in practice, as they were on paper, a\r\nviolation of natural liberty; that they did not stop the flow of\r\nlabour, but that they regulated it in the interest of the employing\r\nclass. The answer to Howlett is given by Ruggles in the _Annals of\r\nAgriculture_.[161] He begins by saying that the Law of Settlement\r\nhas made a poor family ‘of necessity stationary; and obliged them to\r\nrest satisfied with those wages they can obtain where their legal\r\nsettlement happens to be; a restraint on them which ought to insure to\r\nthem wages in the parish where they must remain, more adequate to their\r\nnecessities, because it precludes them in a manner from bringing their\r\nlabour, the only marketable produce they possess, to the best market;\r\nit is this restraint which has, in all manufacturing towns, been one\r\ncause of reducing the poor to such a state of miserable poverty; for,\r\namong the manufacturers, they have too frequently found masters who\r\nhave taken, and continue to take every advantage, which strict law will\r\ngive; of consequence, the prices of labour have been, in manufacturing\r\ntowns, in an inverse ratio of the number of poor settled in the place;\r\nand the same cause has increased that number, by inviting foreigners,\r\nin times when large orders required many workmen; the masters\r\nthemselves being the overseers, whose duty as parish officers has been\r\nopposed by their interest in supplying the demand.’ In other words,\r\nwhen it suited an employer to let fresh workers in, he would, _qua_\r\noverseer, encourage them to come with or without certificates; but when\r\nthey were once in and ‘settled’ he would refuse them certificates to\r\nenable them to go and try their fortunes elsewhere, in parishes where\r\na certificate was demanded with each poor new-comer.[162] Thus it is\r\nnot surprising to find, from Eden’s _Reports_, that certificates are\r\nnever granted at Leeds and Skipton; seldom granted at Sheffield; not\r\nwillingly granted at Nottingham, and that at Halifax certificates are\r\nnot granted at present, and only three have been granted in the last\r\neighteen years.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that the figures about removals in different\r\nparishes given by Eden in his second and third volumes show that the\r\nLaw of Settlement was ‘not so black as it has been painted.’[163] But\r\nin considering the small number of removals, we must also consider the\r\nlarge number of places where there is this entry, ‘certificates are\r\nnever granted.’ It needed considerable courage to go to a new parish\r\nwithout a certificate and run the risk of an ignominious expulsion, and\r\nthough all overseers were not so strict as the one described by Dr.\r\nBurn, yet the fame of one vexatious removal would have a far-reaching\r\neffect in checking migration. It is clear that the law must have\r\noperated in this way in districts where enclosures took away employment\r\nwithin the parish. Suppose Hodge to have lived at Kibworth-Beauchamp in\r\nLeicestershire. About 1780, 3600 acres were enclosed and turned from\r\narable to pasture; before enclosure the fields ‘were solely applied to\r\nthe production of corn,’ and ‘the Poor had then plenty of employment\r\nin weeding, reaping, threshing, etc., and could also collect a great\r\ndeal of corn by gleaning.’[164] After the change, as Eden admits, a\r\nthird or perhaps a fourth of the number of hands would be sufficient\r\nto do all the farming work required. Let us say that Hodge was one of\r\nthe superfluous two-thirds, and that the parish authorities refused him\r\na certificate. What did he do? He applied to the overseer, who sent\r\nhim out as a roundsman.[165] He would prefer to bear the ills he knew\r\nrather than face the unknown in the shape of a new parish officer,\r\nwho might demand a certificate, and send him back with ignominy if he\r\nfailed to produce one. If he took his wife and family with him there\r\nwas even less chance of the demand for a certificate being waived.[166]\r\nSo at Kibworth-Beauchamp Hodge and his companions remained, in a state\r\nof chronic discontent. ‘The Poor complain of hard treatment from the\r\noverseers, and the overseers accuse the Poor of being saucy.’[167]\r\n\r\nNow, at first sight, it seems obvious that it would be to the interest\r\nof a parish to give a poor man a certificate, if there were no market\r\nfor his labour at home, in order to enable him to go elsewhere and\r\nmake an independent living. This seems the reasonable view, but it\r\nis incorrect. In the same way, it would seem obvious that a parish\r\nwould give slight relief to a person whose claim was in doubt rather\r\nthan spend ten times the amount in contesting that claim at law. In\r\npoint of fact, in neither case do we find what seems the reasonable\r\ncourse adopted. Parishes spent fortunes in lawsuits. And to the parish\r\nauthorities it would seem that they risked more in giving Hodge a\r\ncertificate than in obliging him to stay at home, even if he could not\r\nmake a living in his native place; for he might, with his certificate,\r\nwander a long way off, and then fall into difficulties, and have to\r\nbe fetched back at great expense, and the cost of removing him would\r\nfall on the certificating parish. There is a significant passage in\r\nthe _Annals of Agriculture_[168] about the wool trade in 1788. ‘We\r\nhave lately had some hand-bills scattered about Bocking, I am told,\r\npromising full employ to combers and weavers, that would migrate\r\nto Nottingham. Even if they chose to try this offer; as probably a\r\nparish certificate for such a distance would be refused; it cannot be\r\nattempted.’ Where parishes saw an immediate prospect of getting rid\r\nof their superfluous poor into a neighbouring parish with open fields\r\nor a common, they were indeed not chary of granting certificates. At\r\nHothfield in Kent, for example, ‘full half of the labouring poor are\r\ncertificated persons from other parishes: the above-mentioned common,\r\nwhich affords them the means of keeping a cow, or poultry, is supposed\r\nto draw many Poor into the parish; certificated persons are allowed to\r\ndig peat.’[169]\r\n\r\nIn the Rules for the government of the Poor in the hundreds of Loes and\r\nWilford in Suffolk[170] very explicit directions are given about the\r\ngranting of certificates. In the first place, before any certificate\r\nis granted the applicant must produce an examination taken before a\r\nJustice of the Peace, showing that he belongs to one of the parishes\r\nwithin the hundred. Granted that he has complied with this condition,\r\nthen, (1) if he be a labourer or husbandman no certificate will be\r\ngranted him out of the hundreds unless he belongs to the parish of\r\nKenton, and even in that case it is ‘not to exceed the distance of\r\nthree miles’; (2) if he be a tradesman, artificer, or manufacturer a\r\ncertificate may be granted to him out of the hundreds, but in no case\r\nis it to exceed the distance of twenty miles from the parish to which\r\nhe belongs. The extent of the hundreds was roughly fourteen miles by\r\nfive and a half.\r\n\r\nEden, describing the neighbourhood of Coventry, says: ‘In a country\r\nparish on one side the city, chiefly consisting of cottages inhabited\r\nby ribbon-weavers, the Rates are as high as in Coventry; whilst, in\r\nanother parish, on the opposite side, they do not exceed one-third of\r\nthe City Rate: this is ascribed to the care that is taken to prevent\r\nmanufacturers from settling in the parish.’[171] In the neighbourhood\r\nof Mollington (Warwickshire and Oxon) the poor rates varied from 2s.\r\nto 4s. in the pound. ‘The difference in the several parishes, it is\r\nsaid, arises, in a great measure, from the facility or difficulty of\r\nobtaining settlements: in several parishes, a fine is imposed on a\r\nparishioner, who settles a newcomer by hiring, or otherwise, so that a\r\nservant is very seldom hired for a year. Those parishes which have for\r\na long time been in the habit of using these precautions, are now very\r\nlightly burthened with Poor. This is often the case, where farms are\r\nlarge, and of course in few hands; while other parishes, not politic\r\nenough to observe these rules, are generally burthened with an influx\r\nof poor neighbours.’[172] Another example of this is Deddington (Oxon)\r\nwhich like other parishes that possessed common fields suffered from\r\nan influx of small farmers who had been turned out elsewhere, whereas\r\nneighbouring parishes, possessed by a few individuals, were cautious in\r\npermitting newcomers to gain settlements.[173]\r\n\r\nThis practice of hiring servants for fifty-one weeks only was common:\r\nEden thought it fraudulent and an evasion of the law that would not\r\nbe upheld in a court of justice,[174] but he was wrong, for the 1817\r\nReport on the Poor Law mentions among ‘the measures, justifiable\r\nundoubtedly in point of law, which are adopted very generally in many\r\nparts of the kingdom, to defeat the obtaining a settlement, that\r\nof hiring labourers for a less period than a year; from whence it\r\nnaturally and necessarily follows, that a labourer may spend the season\r\nof his health and industry in one parish, and be transferred in the\r\ndecline of life to a distant part of the kingdom.’[175] We hear little\r\nabout the feelings of the unhappy labourers who were brought home by\r\nthe overseers when they fell into want in a parish which had taken\r\nthem in with their certificate, but it is not difficult to imagine\r\nthe scene. It is significant that the Act of 1795 (to which we shall\r\nrefer later), contained a provision that orders of removal were to be\r\nsuspended in cases where the pauper was dangerously ill.\r\n\r\nFrom the Rules for the Government of the Poor in the Hundreds of Loes\r\nand Wilford, already alluded to, we learn some particulars of the\r\nallowance made for the removal of paupers. Twenty miles was to be\r\nconsidered a day’s journey; 2d. was to be allowed for one horse, and so\r\non in proportion per mile: but if the distance were over twenty miles,\r\nor the overseer were obliged to be out all night, then 2s. was to be\r\nallowed for him, 1s. for his horse, and 6d. for each pauper.[176] It is\r\nimprobable that such a scale of payment would induce the overseer to\r\nlook kindly on the causes of his trouble: much less would a pauper be a\r\n_persona grata_ if litigation over his settlement had already cost the\r\nparish large sums.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to give these particulars of the Law of\r\nSettlement for two reasons. In the first place, the probability of\r\nexpulsion, ‘exile by administrative order,’ as it has been called,\r\nthrew a shadow over the lives of the poor. In the second place, the\r\nold Law of Settlement became an immensely more important social\r\nimpediment when enclosure and the great industrial inventions began to\r\nredistribute population. When the normal labourer had common rights\r\nand a strip and a cow, he would not wish to change his home on account\r\nof temporary distress: after enclosure he was reduced to a position in\r\nwhich his distress, if he stayed on in his own village, was likely to\r\nbe permanent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe want and suffering revealed in Davies’ and Eden’s budgets came to\r\na crisis in 1795, the year of what may be called the revolt of the\r\nhousewives. That year, when exceptional scarcity sharpened the edge\r\nof the misery caused by the changes we have summarised, was marked by\r\na series of food riots all over England, in which a conspicuous part\r\nwas taken by women. These disturbances are particularly interesting\r\nfrom the discipline and good order which characterise the conduct\r\nof the rioters. The rioters when they found themselves masters of\r\nthe situation did not use their strength to plunder the shops: they\r\norganised distribution, selling the food they seized at what they\r\nconsidered fair rates, and handing over the proceeds to the owners.\r\nThey did not rob: they fixed prices, and when the owner of provisions\r\nwas making for a dearer market they stopped his carts and made him sell\r\non the spot. At Aylesbury in March ‘a numerous mob, consisting chiefly\r\nof women, seized on all the wheat that came to market, and compelled\r\nthe farmers to whom it belonged to accept of such prices as they\r\nthought proper to name.’[177] In Devonshire the rioters scoured the\r\ncountry round Chudleigh, destroying two mills: ‘from the great number\r\nof petticoats, it is generally supposed that several men were dressed\r\nin female attire.’[178] At Carlisle a band of women accompanied by boys\r\nparaded the streets, and in spite of the remonstrances of a magistrate,\r\nentered various houses and shops, seized all the grain, deposited it\r\nin the public hall, and then formed a committee to regulate the price\r\nat which it should be sold.[179] At Ipswich there was a riot over the\r\nprice of butter, and at Fordingbridge, a certain Sarah Rogers, in\r\ncompany with other women started a cheap butter campaign. Sarah took\r\nsome butter from Hannah Dawson ‘with a determination of keeping it at\r\na reduced price,’ an escapade for which she was afterwards sentenced\r\nto three months’ hard labour at the Winchester Assizes. ‘Nothing but\r\nthe age of the prisoner (being very young) prevented the Court from\r\npassing a more severe sentence.’[180] At Bath the women actually\r\nboarded a vessel, laden with wheat and flour, which was lying in the\r\nriver and refused to let her go. When the Riot Act was read they\r\nretorted that they were not rioting, but were resisting the sending of\r\ncorn abroad, and sang God save the King. Although the owner took an\r\noath that the corn was destined for Bristol, they were not satisfied,\r\nand ultimately soldiers were called in, and the corn was relanded and\r\nput into a warehouse.[181] In some places the soldiers helped the\r\npopulace in their work of fixing prices: at Seaford, for example, they\r\nseized and sold meat and flour in the churchyard, and at Guildford\r\nthey were the ringleaders in a movement to lower the price of meat\r\nto 4d. a pound, and were sent out of the town by the magistrates in\r\nconsequence.[182] These spontaneous leagues of consumers sprang up in\r\nmany different parts, for in addition to the places already mentioned\r\nthere were disturbances of sufficient importance to be chronicled in\r\nthe newspapers, in Wiltshire, Suffolk, and Norfolk, whilst Eden states\r\nthat at Deddington the populace seized on a boat laden with flour,\r\nbut restored it on the miller’s promising to sell it at a reduced\r\nprice.[183]\r\n\r\nThese riots are interesting from many points of view. They are a rising\r\nof the poor against an increasing pressure of want, and the forces\r\nthat were driving down their standard of life. They did not amount to\r\na social rebellion, but they mark a stage in the history of the poor.\r\nTo the rich they were a signal of danger. Davies declared that if the\r\nruling classes learnt from his researches what was the condition of the\r\npoor, they would intervene to rescue the labourers from ‘the abject\r\nstate into which they are sunk.’ Certainly the misery of which his\r\nbudgets paint the plain surface could not be disregarded. If compassion\r\nwas not a strong enough force to make the ruling classes attend to the\r\ndanger that the poor might starve, fear would certainly have made them\r\nthink of the danger that the poor might rebel. Some of them at any rate\r\nknew their Virgil well enough to remember that in the description of\r\nthe threshold of Orcus, while ‘senectus’ is ‘tristis’ and ‘egestas’ is\r\n‘turpis,’ ‘fames’ is linked with the more ominous epithet ‘malesuada.’\r\nIf a proletariat were left to starve despair might teach bad habits,\r\nand this impoverished race might begin to look with ravenous eyes on\r\nthe lot of those who lived on the spoils and sinecures of the State.\r\nThus fear and pity united to sharpen the wits of the rich, and to turn\r\ntheir minds to the distresses of the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[139] Davies, _The Case of Labourers in Husbandry_, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[140] In some instances it is reckoned as costing only 7s. _Ibid._, see\r\np. 185.\r\n\r\n[141] Davies, p. 181.\r\n\r\n[142] Eden, vol. ii. p. 547.\r\n\r\n[143] Vol. xxv. p. 488.\r\n\r\n[144] See _Annals of Agriculture_, vol. ix. pp. 13, 14, 165-167,\r\n636-646, and vol. x. pp. 218-227.\r\n\r\n[145] Capel Lofft (1751-1824); follower of Fox; writer of poems and\r\ntranslations from Virgil and Petrarch; patron of Robert Bloomfield,\r\nauthor of _Farmer’s Boy_.

Now we do hereby declare, that we are fully convinced of the\r\nillegality of such proceedings, and that no person has a right to leaze\r\nany sort of grain, or to come on any field whatsoever, without the\r\nconsent of the owner; and are also truly sensible of the obligation we\r\nare under to the said Edward Perry for his lenity towards us, inasmuch\r\nas the damages given, together with the heavy cost incurred, would have\r\nbeen much greater than we could possibly have discharged, and must\r\nhave amounted to perpetual imprisonment, as even those who have least\r\ndisapproved of our conduct, would certainly not have contributed so\r\nlarge a sum to deliver us from the legal consequences of it. And we do\r\nhereby faithfully promise never to be guilty of the same, or any like\r\noffence in future. Thomas Abree, Margaret Abree.

The governing fact of the situation was\r\nthat the labourer’s wages no longer sufficed to provide even a bare\r\nand comfortless existence. It was necessary then that his wages\r\nshould be raised, or that the effects of the rise in prices should\r\nbe counteracted by changes of diet and manner of life, or that the\r\neconomic resources which formerly supplemented his earnings should in\r\nsome way be restored, unless he was to be thrown headlong on to the\r\nPoor Law. We shall see what advice was given and what advice was taken\r\nin these momentous years.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIET REFORM\r\n\r\nA disparity between income and expenditure may be corrected by\r\nincreasing income or by reducing expenditure. Many of the upper classes\r\nthought that the second method might be tried in this emergency, and\r\nthat a judicious change of diet would enable the labourer to face the\r\nfall of wages with equanimity. The solution seemed to lie in the simple\r\nlife. Enthusiasts soon began to feel about this proposal the sort of\r\nexcitement that Robinson Crusoe enjoyed when discovering new resources\r\non his island: an infinite vista of kitchen reform beckoned to their\r\ningenious imaginations: and many of them began to persuade themselves\r\nthat the miseries of the poor arose less from the scantiness of their\r\nincomes than from their own improvidence and unthriftiness.[184]\r\nThe rich set an example in the worst days by cutting off pastry and\r\nrestricting their servants to a quartern loaf a week each.[185] It was\r\nsurely not too much in these circumstances to ask the poor to adapt\r\ntheir appetites to the changed conditions of their lives, and to shake\r\noff what Pitt called ‘groundless prejudices’ to mixed bread of barley,\r\nrye, and wheat.[186] Again oatmeal was a common food in the north, why\r\nshould it not be taken in the south? If no horses except post horses\r\nand perhaps cavalry horses were allowed oats, there would be plenty for\r\nthe poor.[187] A Cumberland labourer with a wife and family of five\r\nwas shown by Eden[188] to have spent £7, 9s. 2d. a year on oatmeal and\r\nbarley, whereas a Berkshire labourer with a wife and four children at\r\nhome spent £36, 8s. a year on wheaten bread alone.[189] Clearly the\r\nstarving south was to be saved by the introduction of cheap cereals.\r\n\r\nOther proposals of this time were to break against the opposition of\r\nthe rich. This broke against the opposition of the poor. All attempts\r\nto popularise substitutes failed, and the poorer the labourer grew\r\nthe more stubbornly did he insist on wheaten bread. ‘Even household\r\nbread is scarcely ever used: they buy the finest wheaten bread, and\r\ndeclare (what I much doubt), that brown bread disorders their bowels.\r\nBakers do not now make, as they formerly did, bread of unsifted flour:\r\nat some farmers’ houses, however, it is still made of flour, as it\r\ncomes from the mill; but this practice is going much into disuse.\r\n20 years ago scarcely any other than brown bread was used.’[190] At\r\nEaling, when the charitable rich raised a subscription to provide\r\nthe distressed poor with brown bread at a reduced price, many of the\r\nlabourers thought it so coarse and unpalatable that they returned the\r\ntickets though wheaten bread was at 1s. 3d. the quartern loaf.[191]\r\nCorrespondent after correspondent to the _Annals of Agriculture_ notes\r\nand generally deplores the fact that the poor, as one of them phrases\r\nit, are too fine-mouthed to eat any but the finest bread.[192] Lord\r\nSheffield, judging from his address to Quarter Sessions at the end of\r\n1795, would have had little mercy on such grumblers. After explaining\r\nthat in his parish relief was now given partly in potatoes, partly in\r\nwheaten flour, and partly in oaten or barley flour, he declared: ‘If\r\nany wretches should be found so lost to all decency, and so blind as\r\nto revolt against the dispensations of providence, and to refuse the\r\nfood proposed for their relief, the parish officers will be justified\r\nin refusing other succour, and may be assured of support from the\r\nmagistracy of the county.’[193]\r\n\r\nTo the rich, the reluctance of the labourer to change his food came\r\nas a painful surprise. They had thought of him as a roughly built and\r\nhardy animal, comparatively insensible to his surroundings, like the\r\nfigure Lucretius drew of the primeval labourer:\r\n\r\n    Et majoribus et solidis magis ossibus intus\r\n    Fundatum, et validis aptum per viscera nervis;\r\n    Nec facile ex aestu, nec frigore quod caperetur,\r\n    Nec novitate cibi, nec labi corporis ulla.\r\n\r\nThey did not know that a romantic and adventurous appetite is one of\r\nthe blessings of an easy life, and that the more miserable a man’s\r\ncondition, and the fewer his comforts, the more does he shrink from\r\nexperiments of diet. They were therefore surprised and displeased to\r\nfind that labourers rejected soup, even soup served at a rich man’s\r\ntable, exclaiming, ‘This is washy stuff, that affords no nourishment:\r\nwe will not be fed on meal, and chopped potatoes like hogs.’[194] The\r\ndislike of change of food was remarked by the Poor Law Commissioners\r\nin 1834, who observed that the labourer had acquired or retained ‘with\r\nthe moral helplessness some of the other peculiarities of a child. He\r\nis often disgusted to a degree which other classes scarcely conceive\r\npossible, by slight differences in diet; and is annoyed by anything\r\nthat seems to him strange and new.’[195]\r\n\r\nApart from the constitutional conservatism of the poor there were good\r\nreasons for the obstinacy of the labourers. Davies put one aspect\r\nof the case very well. ‘If the working people of other countries are\r\ncontent with bread made of rye, barley, or oats, have they not milk,\r\ncheese, butter, fruits, or fish, to eat with that coarser bread? And\r\nwas not this the case of our own people formerly, when these grains\r\nwere the common productions of our land, and when scarcely wheat\r\nenough was grown for the use of the nobility and principal gentry?\r\nFlesh-meat, butter, and cheese, were then at such moderate prices,\r\ncompared with the present prices, that poor people could afford to\r\nuse them in common. And with a competent quantity of these articles,\r\na coarser kind of bread might very well satisfy the common people of\r\nany country.’[196] He also states that where land had not been so\r\nhighly improved as to produce much wheat, barley, oatmeal, or maslin\r\nbread were still in common use. Arthur Young himself realised that the\r\nlabourer’s attachment to wheaten bread was not a mere superstition of\r\nthe palate. ‘In the East of England I have been very generally assured,\r\nby the labourers who work the hardest, that they prefer the finest\r\nbread, not because most pleasant, but most contrary to a lax habit of\r\nbody, which at once prevents all _strong_ labour. The quality of the\r\nbread that is eaten by those who have meat, and perhaps porter and\r\nport, is of very little consequence indeed; but to the hardworking\r\nman, who nearly lives on it, the case is abundantly different.’[197]\r\nFox put this point in a speech in the House of Commons in the debate\r\non the high price of corn in November 1795. He urged gentlemen, who\r\nwere talking of mixed bread for the people, ‘not to judge from any\r\nexperiment made with respect to themselves. I have myself tasted bread\r\nof different sorts, I have found it highly pleasant, and I have no\r\ndoubt it is exceedingly wholesome. But it ought to be recollected\r\nhow very small a part the article of bread forms of the provisions\r\nconsumed by the more opulent classes of the community. To the poor it\r\nconstitutes, the chief, if not the sole article of subsistence.’[198]\r\nThe truth is that the labourer living on bread and tea had too delicate\r\na digestion to assimilate the coarser cereals, and that there was,\r\napart from climate and tradition, a very important difference between\r\nthe labourer in the north and the labourer in the south, which the\r\nrich entirely overlooked. That difference comes out in an analysis of\r\nthe budgets of the Cumberland labourer and the Berkshire labourer.\r\nThe Cumberland labourer who spent only £7, 9s. on his cereals, spent\r\n£2, 13s. 7d. a year on milk. The Berkshire labourer who spent £36, 8s.\r\non wheaten bread spent 8s. 8d. a year on milk. The Cumberland family\r\nconsumed about 1300 quarts in the year, the Berkshire family about two\r\nquarts a week. The same contrast appears in all budget comparisons\r\nbetween north and south. A weaver at Kendal (eight in the family)\r\nspends £12, 9s. on oatmeal and wheat, and £5, 4s. on milk.[199] An\r\nagricultural labourer at Wetherall in Cumberland (five in family)\r\nspends £7, 6s. 9d. on cereals and £2, 13s. 4d. on milk.[200] On the\r\nother side we have a labourer in Shropshire (four in family) spending\r\n£10, 8s. on bread (of wheat rye), and only 8s. 8d. on milk,[201] and\r\na cooper at Frome, Somerset (seven in family) spending £45, 10s. on\r\nbread, and about 17s. on milk.[202] These figures are typical.[203]\r\n\r\nNow oatmeal eaten with milk is a very different food from oatmeal taken\r\nalone, and it is clear from a study of the budgets that if oatmeal\r\nwas to be acclimatised in the south, it was essential to increase\r\nthe consumption of milk. But the great difference in consumption\r\nrepresented not a difference of demand, but a difference of supply. The\r\nsouthern labourer went without milk not from choice but from necessity.\r\nIn the days when he kept cows he drank milk, for there was plenty of\r\nmilk in the village. After enclosure, milk was not to be had. It may\r\nbe that more cows were kept under the new system of farming, though\r\nthis is unlikely, seeing that at this time every patch of arable was\r\na gold-mine, but it is certainly true that milk became scarce in the\r\nvillages. The new type of farmer did not trouble to sell milk at home.\r\n‘Farmers are averse to selling milk; while poor persons who have only\r\none cow generally dispose of all they can spare.’[204] The new farmer\r\nproduced for a larger market: his produce was carried away, as Cobbett\r\nsaid, to be devoured by ‘the idlers, the thieves, the prostitutes who\r\nare all taxeaters in the wens of Bath and London.’ Davies argued, when\r\npleading for the creation of small farms, ‘The occupiers of these small\r\nfarms, as well as the occupiers of Mr. _Kent’s_ larger cottages, would\r\nnot think much of retailing to their poorer neighbours a little corn or\r\na little milk, as they might want, which the poor can now seldom have\r\nat all, and never but as a great favour from the rich farmers.’[205]\r\nSir Thomas Bernard mentioned among the advantages of the Winchilsea\r\nsystem the ‘no inconsiderable convenience to the inhabitants of that\r\nneighbourhood, that these cottagers are enabled to supply them, at a\r\nvery moderate price, with milk, cream, butter, poultry, pig-meat, and\r\nveal: articles which, in general, are not worth the farmer’s attention,\r\nand which, therefore, are supplied by speculators, who greatly enhance\r\nthe price on the public.’[206] Eden[207] records that in Oxfordshire\r\nthe labourers bitterly complain that the farmers, instead of selling\r\ntheir milk to the poor, give it to their pigs, and a writer in the\r\nReports of the Society for Bettering the Condition of the Poor says\r\nthat this was a practice not unusual in many parts of England.[208]\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of milk must be considered a contributory cause of the\r\ngrowth of tea-drinking, a habit that the philanthropists and Cobbett\r\nagreed in condemning. Cobbett declared in his _Advice to Young\r\nMen_[209] that ‘if the slops were in fashion amongst ploughmen and\r\ncarters, we must all be starved; for the food could never be raised.\r\nThe mechanics are half ruined by them.’ In the Report on the Poor\r\npresented to the Hants Quarter Sessions in 1795,[210] the use of tea is\r\ndescribed as ‘a vain present attempt to supply to the spirits of the\r\nmind what is wanting to the strength of the body; but in its lasting\r\neffects impairing the nerves, and therein equally injuring both the\r\nbody and the mind.’ Davies retorted on the rich who found fault with\r\nthe extravagance of the poor in tea-drinking, by pointing out that it\r\nwas their ‘last resource.’ ‘The topic on which the declaimers against\r\nthe extravagance of the poor display their eloquence with most success,\r\nis _tea-drinking_. Why should such people, it is asked, indulge in a\r\nluxury which is only proper for their betters; and not rather content\r\nthemselves with milk, which is in every form wholesome and nourishing?\r\nWere it true that poor people could every where procure so excellent\r\nan article as milk, there would be then just reason to reproach them\r\nfor giving the preference to the miserable infusion of which they\r\nare so fond. But it is not so. Wherever the poor can get milk, do\r\nthey not gladly use it? And where they cannot get it, would they not\r\ngladly exchange their tea for it?[211]... Still you exclaim, _Tea is\r\na luxury_. If you mean fine hyson tea, sweetened with refined sugar,\r\nand softened with cream, I readily admit it to be so. But _this_ is\r\nnot the tea of the poor. Spring water, just coloured with a few leaves\r\nof the lowest-priced tea, and sweetened with the brownest sugar, is\r\nthe luxury for which you reproach them. To this they have recourse\r\nfrom mere necessity: and were they now to be deprived of this, they\r\nwould immediately be reduced to bread and water. Tea-drinking is not\r\nthe cause, but the consequence, of the distresses of the poor.’[212]\r\nWe learn from the _Annals of Agriculture_ that at Sedgefield in\r\nDurham[213] many of the poor declared that they had been driven to\r\ndrinking tea from not being able to procure milk.[214]\r\n\r\nNo doubt the scarcity of milk helped to encourage a taste that was\r\nvery quickly acquired by all classes in England, and not in England\r\nonly, for, before the middle of the eighteenth century, the rapid\r\ngrowth of tea-drinking among the poor in the Lowlands of Scotland was\r\naffecting the revenue very seriously.[215] The English poor liked tea\r\nfor the same reason that Dr. Johnson liked it, as a stimulant, and the\r\nfact that their food was monotonous and insipid made it particularly\r\nattractive. Eden shows that by the end of the eighteenth century it\r\nwas in general use among poor families, taking the place both of beer\r\nand of milk, and excluding the substitutes that Eden wished to make\r\npopular. It seems perhaps less surprising to us than it did to him,\r\nthat when the rich, who could eat or drink what they liked, enjoyed\r\ntea, the poor thought bread and tea a more interesting diet than bread\r\nand barley water.\r\n\r\nA few isolated attempts were made to remedy the scarcity of milk,[216]\r\nwhich had been caused by enclosure and the consolidation of farms.\r\nLord Winchilsea’s projects have already been described. In the Reports\r\nof the Society for bettering the Condition of the Poor, there are two\r\naccounts of plans for supplying milk cheap, one in Staffordshire, where\r\na respectable tradesman undertook to keep a certain number of cows\r\nfor the purpose in a parish where ‘the principal number of the poorer\r\ninhabitants were destitute of all means of procuring milk for their\r\nfamilies,’[217] another at Stockton in Durham, where the bishop made\r\nit a condition of the lease of a certain farm, that the tenant should\r\nkeep fifteen cows whose milk was to be sold at 1/2d. a pint to the\r\npoor.[218] Mr. Curwen again, the Whig M.P. for Carlisle, had a plan\r\nfor feeding cows in the winter with a view to providing the poor with\r\nmilk.[219]\r\n\r\nThere was another way in which the enclosures had created an\r\ninsuperable obstacle to the popularising of ‘cheap and agreeable\r\nsubstitutes’ for expensive wheaten bread. The Cumberland housewife\r\ncould bake her own barley bread in her oven ‘heated with heath, furze\r\nor brush-wood, the expence of which is inconsiderable’[220]; she had\r\nstretches of waste land at her door where the children could be sent\r\nto fetch fuel. ‘There is no comparison to the community,’ wrote a\r\ncontributor to the _Annals of Agriculture_,[221] ‘whether good wheat,\r\nrye, turnips, etc., are not better than brakes, goss, furz, broom, and\r\nheath,’ but as acre after acre in the midlands and south was enclosed,\r\nthe fuel of the poor grew ever scantier. When the common where he had\r\ngleaned his firing was fenced off, the poor man could only trust for\r\nhis fuel to pilferings from the hedgerows. To the spectator, furze from\r\nthe common might seem ‘gathered with more loss of time than it appears\r\nto be worth’[222]; to the labourer whose scanty earnings left little\r\nmargin over the expense of bread alone, the loss of firing was not\r\nbalanced by the economy of time.[223]\r\n\r\nInsufficient firing added to the miseries caused by insufficient\r\nclothes and food. An ingenious writer in the _Annals of\r\nAgriculture_[224] suggested that the poor should resort to the stables\r\nfor warmth, as was the practice in the duchy of Milan. Fewer would\r\nsuffer death from want of fire in winter, he argued, and also it would\r\nbe a cheap way of helping them, as it cost no fuel, for cattle were so\r\nobliging as to dispense warmth from their persons for nothing. But even\r\nthis plan (which was not adopted) would not have solved the problem\r\nof cooking. The labourer might be blamed for his diet of fine wheaten\r\nbread and for having his meat (when he had any) roasted instead of made\r\ninto soup, but how could cooking be done at home without fuel? ‘No\r\ndoubt, a labourer,’ says Eden,[225] ‘whose income was only £20 a year,\r\nwould, in general, act wisely in substituting hasty-pudding, barley\r\nbread, boiled milk, and potatoes, for bread and beer; but in most parts\r\nof this county, he is debarred not more by prejudice, than by local\r\ndifficulties, from using a diet that requires cooking at home. The\r\nextreme dearness of fuel in Oxfordshire, compels him to purchase his\r\ndinner at the baker’s; and, from his unavoidable consumption of bread,\r\nhe has little left for cloaths, in a country where warm cloathing is\r\nmost essentially wanted.’ In Davies’ more racy and direct language, ‘it\r\nis but little that in the present state of things the belly can spare\r\nfor the back.’[226] Davies also pointed out the connection between dear\r\nfuel and the baker. ‘Where fuel is scarce and dear, poor people find it\r\ncheaper to buy their bread of the baker than to bake for themselves....\r\nBut where fuel abounds, and costs only the trouble of cutting and\r\ncarrying home, there they may save something by baking their own\r\nbread.’[227] Complaints of the pilfering of hedgerows were very common.\r\n‘Falstaff says “his soldiers found linen on every hedge”; and I fear\r\nit is but too often the case, that labourers’ children procure fuel\r\nfrom the same quarter.’[228] There were probably many families like\r\nthe two described in Davies[229] who spent nothing on fuel, which\r\nthey procured by gathering cow-dung, and breaking their neighbours’\r\nhedges.’[230]\r\n\r\nIn some few cases, the benevolent rich did not content themselves with\r\nattempting to enforce the eighth commandment, but went to the root of\r\nthe matter, helping to provide a substitute for their hedgerows. An\r\ninteresting account of such an experiment is given in the _Reports\r\non the Poor_,[231] by Scrope Bernard. ‘There having been several\r\nprosecutions at the Aylesbury Quarter Sessions, for stealing fuel last\r\nwinter, I was led to make particular inquiries, respecting the means\r\nwhich the poor at Lower Winchendon had of providing fuel. I found that\r\nthere was no fuel then to be sold within several miles of the place;\r\nand that, amid the distress occasioned by the long frost, a party of\r\ncottagers had joined in hiring a person, to fetch a load of pit-coal\r\nfrom Oxford, for their supply. In order to encourage this disposition\r\nto acquire fuel in an honest manner,’ a present was made to all this\r\nparty of as much coal again as they had already purchased carriage\r\nfree. Next year the vestry determined to help, and with the aid of\r\nprivate donations coal was distributed at 1s. 4d. the cwt. (its cost\r\nat the Oxford wharf), and kindling faggots at 1d. each. ‘It had been\r\nsaid that the poor would not find money to purchase them, when they\r\nwere brought: instead of which out of 35 poor families belonging to\r\nthe parish, 29 came with ready money, husbanded out of their scanty\r\nmeans, to profit with eagerness of this attention to their wants; and\r\namong them a person who had been lately imprisoned by his master for\r\nstealing wood from his hedges.’ Mr. Bernard concludes his account with\r\nsome apt remarks on the difficulties of combining honesty with grinding\r\npoverty.[232]\r\n\r\n\r\nMINIMUM WAGE\r\n\r\nThe attempts to reduce cottage expenditure were thus a failure. We must\r\nnow describe the attempts to increase the cottage income. There were\r\ntwo ways in which the wages of the labourers might have been raised.\r\nOne way, the way of combination, was forbidden by law. The other way\r\nwas the fixing of a legal minimum wage in relation to the price of\r\nfood. This was no new idea, for the regulation of wages by law was a\r\nvenerable English institution, as old as the Statute of Edward III. The\r\nmost recent laws on the subject were the famous Act of Elizabeth, an\r\nAct of James I., and an Act of George II. (1747). The Act of Elizabeth\r\nprovided that the Justices of the Peace should meet annually and assess\r\nthe wages of labourers in husbandry and of certain other workmen.\r\nPenalties were imposed on all who gave or took a wage in excess of\r\nthis assessment. The Act of James I. was passed to remove certain\r\nambiguities that were believed to have embarrassed the operation of the\r\nAct of Elizabeth, and among other provisions imposed a penalty on all\r\nwho gave a wage below the wage fixed by the magistrates. The Act of\r\n1747[233] was passed because the existing laws were ‘insufficient and\r\ndefective,’ and it provided that disputes between masters and men could\r\nbe referred to the magistrates, ‘although no rate or assessment of\r\nwages has been made that year by the Justices of the shire where such\r\ncomplaint shall be made.’\r\n\r\nTwo questions arise on the subject of this legislation, Was it\r\noperative? In whose interests was it administered, the interests of the\r\nemployers or the interests of the employed? As to the first question\r\nthere is a good deal of negative evidence to show that during the\r\neighteenth century these laws were rarely applied. An example of an\r\nassessment (an assessment declaring a maximum) made by the Lancashire\r\nmagistrates in 1725, was published in the _Annals of Agriculture_ in\r\n1795[234] as an interesting curiosity, and the writer remarks: ‘It\r\nappears from Mr. Ruggles’ excellent _History of the Poor_ that such\r\norders must in general be searched for in earlier periods, and a\r\nfriend of ours was much surprised to hear that any magistrates in the\r\npresent century would venture on so bold a measure.’[235]\r\n\r\nAs to the second question, at the time we are discussing it was\r\ncertainly taken for granted that this legislation was designed to keep\r\nwages down. So implicitly was this believed that the Act of James I.\r\nwhich provided penalties in cases where wages were given below the\r\nfixed rate was generally ignored, and speakers and writers mentioned\r\nonly the Act of Elizabeth, treating it as an Act for fixing a maximum.\r\nWhitbread, for example, when introducing a Bill in 1795 to fix a\r\nminimum wage, with which we deal later, argued that the Elizabethan\r\nAct ought to be repealed because it fixed a maximum. This view of the\r\nearlier legislation was taken by Fox, who supported Whitbread’s Bill,\r\nand by Pitt who opposed it. Fox said of the Act of Elizabeth that\r\n‘it secured the master from a risk which could but seldom occur, of\r\nbeing charged exorbitantly for the quantity of service; but it did not\r\nauthorise the magistrate to protect the poor from the injustice of a\r\ngrinding and avaricious master, who might be disposed to take advantage\r\nof their necessities, and undervalue the rate of their services.’[236]\r\nPitt said that Whitbread ‘imagined that he had on his side of the\r\nquestion the support of experience in this country, and appealed to\r\ncertain laws upon the statute-book in confirmation of his proposition.\r\nHe did not find himself called upon to defend the principle of these\r\nstatutes, but they were certainly introduced for purposes widely\r\ndifferent from the object of the present bill. They were enacted to\r\nguard the industry of the country from being checked by a general\r\ncombination among labourers; and the bill now under consideration was\r\nintroduced solely for the purpose of remedying the inconveniences which\r\nlabourers sustain from the disproportion existing between the price of\r\nlabour and the price of living.’[237] Only one speaker in the debates,\r\nVansittart, afterwards Chancellor of the Exchequer, took the view\r\nthat legislation was not needed because the Act of James I. gave the\r\nmagistrates the powers with which Whitbread sought to arm them.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that many minds searching after a way of escape from the\r\ngrowing distress of the labourers, at a time when wages had not kept\r\npace with prices, should have turned to the device of assessing wages\r\nby law in accordance with the price of provisions. If prices could\r\nnot be assimilated to wages, could not wages be assimilated to prices?\r\nNathaniel Kent, no wild visionary, had urged employers to raise wages\r\nin proportion to the increase of their profits, but his appeal had\r\nbeen without effect. But the policy of regulating wages according to\r\nthe price of food was recommended in several quarters, and it provoked\r\na great deal of discussion. Burke, whose days were closing in, was\r\ntempted to take part in it, and he put an advertisement into the papers\r\nannouncing that he was about to publish a series of letters on the\r\nsubject. The letters never appeared, but Arthur Young has described the\r\nvisit he paid to Beaconsfield at this time and Burke’s rambling thunder\r\nabout ‘the absurdity of regulating labour and the mischief of our\r\npoor laws,’ and Burke’s published works include a paper _Thoughts and\r\nDetails on Scarcity_, presented to Pitt in November 1795. In this paper\r\nBurke argued that the farmer was the true guardian of the labourer’s\r\ninterest, in that it would never be profitable to him to underpay the\r\nlabourer: an uncompromising application of the theory of the economic\r\nman, which was not less superficial than the Jacobins’ application of\r\nthe theory of the natural man.\r\n\r\nIn October 1795 Arthur Young sent out to the various correspondents of\r\nthe Board of Agriculture a circular letter containing this question\r\namong others: ‘It having been recommended by various quarter-sessions,\r\nthat the price of labour should be regulated by that of bread corn,\r\nhave the goodness to state what you conceive to be the advantages or\r\ndisadvantages of such a system?’[238] Arthur Young was himself in\r\nfavour of the proposal, and the Suffolk magistrates, at a meeting which\r\nhe attended on the 12th of October, ordered: ‘That the Members for this\r\ncounty be requested by the chairman to bring a bill into parliament, so\r\nto regulate the price of labour, that it may fluctuate with the average\r\nprice of bread corn.’[239] Most of the replies were adverse, but the\r\nproposal found a warm friend in Mr. Howlett, the Vicar of Dunmow,\r\nwho put into his answer some of the arguments which he afterwards\r\ndeveloped in a pamphlet published in reply to Pitt’s criticisms of\r\nWhitbread’s Bill.[240] Howlett argued that Parliament had legislated\r\nwith success to prevent combinations of workmen, and as an example he\r\nquoted the Acts of 8 George III., which had made the wages of tailors\r\nand silk-weavers subject to the regulations of the magistrates. It was\r\njust as necessary and just as practicable to prevent a combination of\r\na different kind, that of masters. ‘Not a combination indeed formally\r\ndrawn up in writing and sanctioned under hand and seal, a combination,\r\nhowever, as certain (the result of contingencies or providential\r\nevents) and as fatally efficacious as if in writing it had filled five\r\nhundred skins of parchment: a combination which has operated for many\r\nyears with a force rapidly increasing, a combination which has kept\r\nback the hire of our labourers who have reaped down our fields, and\r\nhas at length torn the clothes from their backs, snatched the food\r\nfrom their mouths, and ground the flesh from their bones.’ Howlett, it\r\nwill be seen, took the same view as Thelwall, that the position of the\r\nlabourers was deteriorating absolutely and relatively. He estimated\r\nfrom a survey taken at Dunmow that the average family should be taken\r\nas five; if wages had been regulated on this basis, and the labourer\r\nhad been given per head no more than the cost of a pauper’s keep in the\r\nworkhouse sixty years ago, he would have been very much better off in\r\n1795. He would himself take a higher standard. In reply to the argument\r\nthat the policy of the minimum wage would deprive the labourers of all\r\nspur and incentive he pointed to the case of the London tailors; they\r\nat any rate displayed plenty of life and ingenuity, and nobody could\r\nsay that the London fashions did not change fast enough. Employers\r\nwould no more raise wages without compulsion than they would make good\r\nroads without the aid of turnpikes or the prescription of statutes\r\nenforced by the magistrates. His most original contribution to the\r\ndiscussion was the argument that the legal regulation should not be\r\nleft to the unassisted judgment of the magistrates: ‘it should be\r\nthe result of the clearest, fullest, and most accurate information,\r\nand at length be judiciously adapted to each county, hundred, or\r\ndistrict in every quarter of the kingdom.’ Howlett differed from some\r\nof the supporters of a minimum wage, in thinking that wages should be\r\nregulated by the prices of the necessaries of life, not merely by that\r\nof bread corn.\r\n\r\nThe same policy was advocated by Davies in _The Case of Labourers\r\nin Husbandry_.[241] Davies argued that if the minimum only were\r\nfixed, emulation would not be discouraged, for better workmen would\r\nboth be more sure of employment and also obtain higher wages. He\r\nsuggested that the minimum wage should be fixed by calculating the\r\nsum necessary to maintain a family of five, or by settling the scale\r\nof day wages by the price of bread alone, treating the other expenses\r\nas tolerably steady. He did not propose to regulate the wages of any\r\nbut day labourers, nor did he propose to deal with piecework, although\r\npiecework had been included in the Act of Elizabeth. He further\r\nsuggested that the regulation should be in force only for half the\r\nyear, from November to May, when the labourers’ difficulties pressed\r\nhardest upon them. Unfortunately he coupled with his minimum wage\r\npolicy a proposal to give help from the rates to families with more\r\nthan five members, if the children were unable to earn.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting of all the declarations in favour of a minimum\r\nwage was a declaration from labourers. A correspondent sent the\r\nfollowing advertisement to the _Annals of Agriculture_:--\r\n\r\n ‘The following is an advertisement which I cut out of a Norwich\r\n newspaper:--\r\n\r\n “DAY LABOURERS\r\n\r\n “At a numerous meeting of the day labourers of the little parishes\r\n of Heacham, Snettisham, and Sedgford, this day, 5th November, in the\r\n parish church of Heacham, in the county of Norfolk, in order to take\r\n into consideration the best and most peaceable mode of obtaining a\r\n redress of all the severe and peculiar hardships under which they\r\n have for many years so patiently suffered, the following resolutions\r\n were unanimously agreed to:--1st, That--_The labourer is worthy of\r\n his hire_, and that the mode of lessening his distresses, as hath\r\n been lately the fashion, by selling him flour under the market\r\n price, and thereby rendering him an object of a parish rate, is\r\n not only an indecent insult on his lowly and humble situation (in\r\n itself sufficiently mortifying from his degrading dependence on the\r\n caprice of his employer) but a fallacious mode of relief, and every\r\n way inadequate to a radical redress of the manifold distresses of\r\n his calamitous state. 2nd, That the price of labour should, at all\r\n times, be proportioned to the price of wheat, which should invariably\r\n be regulated by the average price of that necessary article of life;\r\n and that the price of labour, as specified in the annexed plan, is\r\n not only well calculated to make the labourer happy without being\r\n injurious to the farmer, but it appears to us the only rational means\r\n of securing the permanent happiness of this valuable and useful class\r\n of men, and, if adopted in its full extent, will have an immediate and\r\n powerful effect in reducing, if it does not entirely annihilate, that\r\n disgraceful and enormous tax on the public--the POOR RATE.\r\n\r\n “_Plan of the Price of Labour proportionate to the Price of Wheat_\r\n\r\n                  per last.                             per day.\r\n\r\n  When wheat shall be 14l. the price of labour shall be 1s.  2d.\r\n      „       „       16         „       „       „      1s.  4d.\r\n      „       „       18         „       „       „      1s.  6d.\r\n      „       „       20         „       „       „      1s.  8d.\r\n      „       „       22         „       „       „      1s. 10d.\r\n      „       „       24         „       „       „      2s.  0d.\r\n      „       „       26         „       „       „      2s.  2d.\r\n      „       „       28         „       „       „      2s.  4d.\r\n      „       „       30         „       „       „      2s.  6d.\r\n      „       „       32         „       „       „      2s.  8d.\r\n      „       „       34         „       „       „      2s. 10d.\r\n      „       „       36         „       „       „      3s.  0d.\r\n\r\n And so on, according to this proportion.\r\n\r\n “3rd, That a petition to parliament to regulate the price of labour,\r\n conformable to the above plan, be immediately adopted; and that\r\n the day labourers throughout the county be invited to associate\r\n and co-operate in this necessary application to parliament, as a\r\n peaceable, legal, and probable mode of obtaining relief; and, in doing\r\n this, no time should be lost, as the petition must be presented before\r\n the 29th January 1796.\r\n\r\n “4th, That one shilling shall be paid into the hands of the treasurer\r\n by every labourer, in order to defray the expences of advertising,\r\n attending on meetings, and paying counsel to support their petition in\r\n parliament.\r\n\r\n “5th, That as soon as the sense of the day labourers of this county,\r\n or a majority of them, shall be made known to the clerk of the\r\n meeting, a general meeting shall be appointed, in some central town,\r\n in order to agree upon the best and easiest mode of getting the\r\n petition signed: when it will be requested that one labourer, properly\r\n instructed, may be deputed to represent two or three contiguous\r\n parishes, and to attend the above intended meeting with a list of\r\n all the labourers in the parishes he shall represent, and pay their\r\n respective subscriptions; and that the labourer, so deputed, shall\r\n be allowed two shillings and six pence a day for his time, and two\r\n shillings and six pence a day for his expences.\r\n\r\n “6th, That Adam Moore, clerk of the meeting, be directed to have the\r\n above resolutions, with the names of the farmers and labourers who\r\n have subscribed to and approved them, advertised in one Norwich and\r\n one London paper; when it is hoped that the above plan of a petition\r\n to parliament will not only be approved and immediately adopted by the\r\n day labourers of this county, but by the day labourers of every county\r\n in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n “7th, That all letters, _post paid_, addressed to Adam Moore,\r\n labourer, at Heacham, near Lynn, Norfolk, will be duly noticed.”[242]\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most interesting and instructive documents of the\r\ntime. It shows that the labourers, whose steady decline during the\r\nnext thirty years we are about to trace, were animated by a sense of\r\ndignity and independence. Something of the old spirit of the commoners\r\nstill survived. But there is no sequel to this incident. This great\r\nscheme of a labourers’ organisation vanishes: it passes like a flash of\r\nsummer lightning. What is the explanation? The answer is to be found,\r\nwe suspect, in the Treason and Sedition Acts that Pitt was carrying\r\nthrough Parliament in this very month. Under those Acts no language\r\nof criticism was safe, and fifty persons could not meet except in the\r\npresence of a magistrate, who had power to extinguish the meeting and\r\narrest the speaker. Those measures inflicted even wider injury upon the\r\nnation than Fox and Sheridan and Erskine themselves believed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe policy of a minimum wage was brought before Parliament in the\r\nwinter of 1795, in a Bill introduced by Samuel Whitbread, one of\r\nthe small band of brave Liberals who had stood by Fox through the\r\nrevolutionary panic. Whitbread is a politician to whom history has done\r\nless than justice, and he is generally known only as an implacable\r\nopponent of the Peninsular War. That opposition he contrived to\r\nconduct, as we know from the _Creevey Papers_, in such a way as to\r\nwin and keep the respect of Wellington. Whitbread’s disapproval of\r\nthat war, of which Liberals like Holland and Lord John Russell, who\r\ntook Fox’s view of the difference of fighting revolutions by the aid\r\nof kings and fighting Napoleon by the aid of peoples, were strong\r\nsupporters, sprang from his compassion for the miseries of the English\r\npoor. His most notable quality was his vivid and energetic sympathy;\r\nhe spent his life in hopeless battles, and he died by his own hand of\r\npublic despair. The Bill he now introduced was the first of a series of\r\nproposals designed for the rescue of the agricultural labourers. It was\r\nbacked by Sheridan and Grey,[243] and the members for Suffolk.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Bill[244] was to explain and amend the Act of\r\nElizabeth, which empowered Justices of the Peace at or within six weeks\r\nof every General Quarter Sessions held at Easter to regulate the wages\r\nof labourers in husbandry. The provisions of the Bill were briefly as\r\nfollows. At any Quarter Sessions the justices could agree, if they\r\nthought fit, to hold a General Sessions for carrying into execution\r\nthe powers given them by the Act. If they thought good to hold such\r\na General Sessions, the majority of them could ‘rate and appoint the\r\nwages and fix and declare the hours of working of all labourers in\r\nhusbandry, by the day, week, month or year, and with beer or cyder or\r\nwithout, respect being had to the value of money and the plenty or\r\nscarcity of the time.’ This rate was to be printed and posted on the\r\nchurch doors, and was to hold good till superseded by another made in\r\nthe same way. The rate was not to apply to any tradesman or artificer,\r\nnor to any labourer whose diet was wholly provided by his employer, nor\r\nto any labourer _bona fide_ employed on piecework, nor to any labourer\r\nemployed by the parish. The young, the old, and the infirm were also\r\nexempted from the provisions of the Act. It was to be lawful ‘to\r\ncontract with and pay to any male person, under the age of ----[245]\r\nyears, or to any man who from age or infirmity or any other incapacity\r\nshall be unable to do the ordinary work of a labouring man, so much as\r\nhe shall reasonably deserve for the work which he shall be able to do\r\nand shall do.’ In case of complaint the decision as to the ability of\r\nthe labourer rested with the justices.\r\n\r\nWith the above exceptions no labourer was to be hired under the\r\nappointed rates, and any contract for lower wages was void. If\r\nconvicted of breaking the law, an employer was to be fined; if he\r\nrefused to pay the fine, his goods were to be distrained on, and\r\nif this failed to produce enough to pay the expenses, he could be\r\ncommitted to the common gaol or House of Correction. A labourer with\r\nwhom an illegal contract was made was to be a competent witness.\r\n\r\nThe first discussions of the Bill were friendly in tone. On 25th\r\nNovember Whitbread asked for leave to bring it in. Sir William Young,\r\nLechmere, Charles Dundas, and Sir John Rous all spoke with sympathy\r\nand approval. The first reading debate took place on 9th December, and\r\nthough Whitbread had on that occasion the powerful support of Fox,\r\nwho, while not concealing his misgivings about the Bill, thought the\r\nalternative of leaving the great body of the people to depend on the\r\ncharity of the rich intolerable, an ominous note was struck by Pitt and\r\nHenry Dundas on the other side. The Bill came up for second reading\r\non 12th February 1796.[246] Whitbread’s opening speech showed that he\r\nwas well aware that he would have to face a formidable opposition.\r\nPitt rose at once after the motion had been formally seconded by one\r\nof the Suffolk members, and assailed the Bill in a speech that made\r\nan immediate and overwhelming impression. He challenged Whitbread’s\r\nargument that wages had not kept pace with prices; he admitted the\r\nhardships of the poor, but he thought the picture overdrawn, for\r\ntheir hardships had been relieved by ‘a display of beneficence never\r\nsurpassed at any period,’ and he argued that it was a false remedy\r\nto use legislative interference, and to give the justices the power\r\nto regulate the price of labour, and to endeavour ‘to establish by\r\nauthority what would be much better accomplished by the unassisted\r\noperation of principles.’ This led naturally to an attack on the\r\nrestrictions on labour imposed by the Law of Settlement, and a\r\ndiscussion of the operation of the Poor Laws, and the speech ended,\r\nafter a glance at the great possibilities of child employment, with\r\nthe promise of measures which should restore the original purity of\r\nthe Poor Laws, and make them a blessing instead of the curse they had\r\nbecome. The speech seems to have dazzled the House of Commons, and few\r\nstood up against the general opinion that Whitbread’s proposal was\r\ndangerous, and that the whole question had better be left to Pitt.\r\nLechmere, a Worcestershire member, was one of them, and he made an\r\nadmirable little speech in which he tried to destroy the general\r\nillusion that the poor could not be unhappy in a country where the\r\nrich were so kind. Whitbread himself defended his Bill with spirit\r\nand ability, showing that Pitt had not really found any substantial\r\nargument against it, and that Pitt’s own remedies were all hypothetical\r\nand distant. Fox reaffirmed his dislike of compulsion, but restated\r\nat the same time his opinion that Whitbread’s Bill, though not an\r\nideal solution, was the best solution available of evils which pressed\r\nvery hardly on the poor and demanded attention. General Smith pointed\r\nout that one of Pitt’s remedies was the employment of children, and\r\nwarned him that he had himself seen some of the consequences of the\r\nunregulated labour of children ‘whose wan and pale complexions bespoke\r\nthat their constitutions were already undermined, and afforded but\r\nlittle promise of a robust manhood, or of future usefulness to the\r\ncommunity.’ But the general sense of the House was reflected in the\r\nspeeches of Buxton, Coxhead and Burdon, whose main argument was that\r\nthe poor were not in so desperate a plight as Whitbread supposed, and\r\nthat whatever their condition might be, Pitt was the most likely person\r\nto find such remedies as were practicable and effective. The motion for\r\nsecond reading was negatived without a division. The verdict of the\r\nHouse was a verdict of confidence in Pitt.\r\n\r\nFour years later (11th February 1800) Whitbread repeated his\r\nattempt.[247] He asked for leave to bring in a Bill to explain and\r\namend the Act of Elizabeth, and said that he had waited for Pitt to\r\ncarry out his promises. He was aware of the danger of overpaying\r\nthe poor, but artificers and labourers should be so paid as to be\r\nable to keep themselves and their families in comfort. He saw no\r\nway of securing this result in a time of distress except the way he\r\nhad suggested. Pitt rose at once to reply. He had in the interval\r\nbrought in and abandoned his scheme of Poor Law Reform. He had spent\r\nhis only idea, and he was now confessedly without any policy at all.\r\nAll that he could contribute was a general criticism of legislative\r\ninterference, and another discourse on the importance of letting labour\r\nfind its own level. He admitted the fact of scarcity, but he believed\r\nthe labouring class seldom felt fewer privations. History scarcely\r\nprovides a more striking spectacle of a statesman paying himself with\r\nsoothing phrases in the midst of a social cyclone. The House was more\r\nthan ever on his side. All the interests and instincts of class were\r\ndisguised under the gold dust of Adam Smith’s philosophy. Sir William\r\nYoung, Buxton, Wilberforce, Ellison, and Perceval attacked the Bill.\r\nWhitbread replied that charity as a substitute for adequate wages had\r\nmischievous effects, for it took away the independence of the poor,\r\n‘a consideration as valuable to the labourer as to the man of high\r\nrank,’ and as for the argument that labour should be left to find\r\nits own level, the truth surely was that labour found its level by\r\ncombinations, and that this had been found to be so great an evil that\r\nActs of Parliament had been passed against it.\r\n\r\nThe date of the second reading of the Bill was hotly disputed:[248] the\r\nfriends of the measure wanted it to be fixed for 28th April, so that\r\nQuarter Sessions might have time to deliberate on the proposals; the\r\nopponents of the measure suggested 25th February, on the grounds that\r\nit was dangerous to keep the Bill in suspense so long: ‘the eyes of all\r\nthe labouring poor,’ said Mr. Ellison, ‘must in that interval be turned\r\nupon it.’ The opponents won their point, and when the Bill came up for\r\nsecond reading its fate was a foregone conclusion. Whitbread made one\r\nlast appeal, pleading the cause of the labourers bound to practical\r\nserfdom in parishes where the landowner was an absentee, employed at\r\nstarvation wages by farmers, living in cottages let to them by farmers.\r\nBut his appeal was unheeded: Lord Belgrave retorted with the argument\r\nthat legislative interference with agriculture could not be needed,\r\nseeing that five hundred Enclosure Bills had passed the House during a\r\nperiod of war, and the Bill was rejected.\r\n\r\nSo died the policy of the minimum wage. Even later it had its\r\nadherents, for, in 1805, Sir Thomas Bernard criticised it[249] as\r\nthe ‘favourite idea of some very intelligent and benevolent men.’ He\r\nmentioned as a _reductio ad absurdum_ of the scheme, that had the rate\r\nof wages been fixed by the standard of 1780 when the quartern loaf was\r\n6d. and the labourer’s pay 9s. a week, the result in 1800 when the\r\nquartern loaf cost 1s. 9d. would have been a wage of £1, 11s. 6d.\r\n\r\nWhen Whitbread introduced his large and comprehensive Poor Law Bill in\r\n1807,[250] the proposal for a minimum wage was not included.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of the speeches of the time and of the answers\r\nto Arthur Young’s circular printed in the _Annals of Agriculture_,\r\nit is evident that there was a genuine fear among the opponents of\r\nthe measure that if once wages were raised to meet the rise in prices\r\nit would not be easy to reduce them when the famine was over. This\r\nwas put candidly by one of Arthur Young’s correspondents: ‘it is\r\nhere judged more prudent to indulge the poor with bread corn at a\r\nreduced price than to raise the price of wages.’[251] The policy of\r\na minimum wage was revived later by a society called ‘The General\r\nAssociation established for the Purpose of bettering the Condition of\r\nthe Agricultural and Manufacturing Labourers.’ Three representatives of\r\nthis society gave evidence before the Select Committee on Emigration in\r\n1827, and one of them pointed out as an illustration of the injustice\r\nwith which the labourers were treated, that in 1825 the wages of\r\nagricultural labourers were generally 9s. a week, and the price of\r\nwheat 9s. a bushel, whereas in 1732 the wages of agricultural labour\r\nwere fixed by the magistrates at 6s. a week, and the price of wheat was\r\n2s. 9d. the bushel. In support of this comparison he produced a table\r\nfrom _The Gentleman’s Magazine_ of 1732:--\r\n\r\n  Wheat in February 1732, 23s. to 25s. per quarter.\r\n  Wheat in March 1732, 20s. to 22s. per quarter.\r\n\r\nYearly wages appointed by the Justices to be taken by the servants in\r\nthe county of Kent, not exceeding the following sums:\r\n\r\n  Head ploughman waggoner or seedsman   £8  0  0\r\n  His mate                               4  0  0\r\n  Best woman                             3  0  0\r\n  Second sort of woman                   2  0  0\r\n  Second ploughman                       6  0  0\r\n  His mate                               3  0  0\r\n  Labourers by day in summer                1  2\r\n    In winter                               1  0\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICES OF GLOUCESTER\r\n\r\n  Head servant in husbandry                    5  0  0\r\n  Second servant in husbandry                  4  0  0\r\n  Driving boy under fourteen                   1  0  0\r\n  Head maid servant or dairy servant           2 10  0\r\n  Mower in harvest without drink per day          1  2\r\n    With drink                                    1  0\r\n  Other day labourers with drink                  1  0\r\n  From corn to hay harvest with drink             0  8\r\n  Mowers and reapers in corn harvest with drink   1  0\r\n  Labourers with diet                             0  4\r\n    Without diet or drink                         0 10\r\n  Carpenter wheelwright or mason without drink    1  2\r\n    With drink                                    1  0\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses pointed out that there were five millions of\r\nlabourers making with their families eight millions, and that if the\r\neffect of raising their wages was to increase their expenditure by a\r\npenny a day, there would be an increase of consumption amounting to\r\ntwelve millions a year. These arguments made little impression on the\r\nCommittee, and the representations of the society were dismissed with\r\ncontempt: ‘It is from an entire ignorance of the universal operation of\r\nthe principle of Supply and Demand regulating the rate of wages that\r\nall these extravagant propositions are advanced, and recommendations\r\nspread over the country which are so calculated to excite false\r\nhopes, and consequently discontent, in the minds of the labouring\r\nclasses. Among the most extravagant are those brought forward by the\r\nSociety established for the purpose of bettering the condition of the\r\nmanufacturing and agricultural labourers.’\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR LAW REFORM\r\n\r\nPitt, having secured the rejection of Whitbread’s Minimum Wage Bill in\r\n1796, produced his own alternative: Poor Law Reform. It is necessary to\r\nstate briefly what were the Poor Law arrangements at the time of his\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\nThe Poor Law system reposed on the great Act of Elizabeth (1601), by\r\nwhich the State had acknowledged and organised the duty to the poor\r\nwhich it had taken over from the Church. The parish was constituted\r\nthe unit, and overseers, unsalaried and nominated by the J.P.’s, were\r\nappointed for administering relief, the necessary funds being obtained\r\nby a poor rate. Before 1722 a candidate for relief could apply either\r\nto the overseers or to the magistrate. By an Act passed in that year,\r\ndesigned to make the administration stricter, application was to be\r\nmade first to the overseer. If the overseer rejected the application\r\nthe claimant could submit his case to a magistrate, and the magistrate,\r\nafter hearing the overseer’s objection, could order that relief\r\nshould be given. There were, however, a number of parishes in which\r\napplications for relief were made to salaried guardians. These were\r\nthe parishes that had adopted an Act known as Gilbert’s Act, passed in\r\n1782.[252] In these parishes,[253] joined in incorporations, the parish\r\noverseers were not abolished, for they still had the duty of collecting\r\nand accounting for the rates, but the distribution was in the hands\r\nof paid guardians, one for each parish, appointed by the justices\r\nout of a list of names submitted by the parishioners. In each set of\r\nincorporated parishes there was a ‘Visitor’ appointed by the justices,\r\nwho had practically absolute power over the guardians. If the guardians\r\nrefused relief, the claimant could still appeal, as in the case of the\r\noverseers, to the justices.\r\n\r\nSuch was the parish machinery. The method of giving relief varied\r\ngreatly, but the main distinction to be drawn is between (1) out\r\nrelief, or a weekly pension of a shilling or two at home; and (2)\r\nindoor relief, or relief in a workhouse, or poorhouse, or house of\r\nindustry. Out relief was the earlier institution, and it held its own\r\nthroughout the century, being the only form of relief in many parishes.\r\nDown to 1722 parishes that wished to build a workhouse had to get a\r\nspecial Act of Parliament. In that year a great impetus was given to\r\nthe workhouse movement by an Act[254] which authorised overseers, with\r\nthe consent of the vestry, to start workhouses, or to farm out the\r\npoor, and also authorised parishes to join together for this purpose.\r\nIf applicants for relief refused to go into the workhouse, they\r\nforfeited their title to any relief at all. A great many workhouses\r\nwere built in consequence of this Act: in 1732 there were stated to be\r\nsixty in the country, and about fifty in the metropolis.[255]\r\n\r\nEven if the applicant for relief lived in a parish which had built or\r\nshared in a workhouse, it did not follow that he was forced into it.\r\nHe lost his title to receive relief outside, but his fate would depend\r\non the parish officers. In the parishes which had adopted Gilbert’s\r\nAct the workhouse was reserved for the aged, for the infirm, and for\r\nyoung children. In most parishes there was out relief as well as indoor\r\nrelief: in some parishes outdoor relief being allowed to applicants\r\nof a certain age or in special circumstances. In some parishes all\r\noutdoor relief had stopped by 1795.[256] There is no doubt that\r\nin most parishes the workhouse accommodation would have been quite\r\ninadequate for the needs of the parish in times of distress. It was\r\nquite common to put four persons into a single bed.\r\n\r\nThe workhouses were dreaded by the poor,[257] not only for the dirt\r\nand disease and the devastating fevers that swept through them,[258]\r\nbut for reasons that are intelligible enough to any one who has read\r\nEden’s descriptions. Those descriptions show that Crabbe’s picture is\r\nno exaggeration:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Theirs is yon House that holds the Parish-Poor,\r\n    Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door;\r\n    There, where the putrid vapours, flagging, play,\r\n    And the dull wheel hums doleful through the day;--\r\n    There Children dwell who know no Parents’ care;\r\n    Parents, who know no Children’s love, dwell there!\r\n    Heart-broken Matrons on their joyless bed,\r\n    Forsaken Wives and Mothers never wed;\r\n    Dejected Widows with unheeded tears,\r\n    And crippled Age with more than childhood fears;\r\n    The Lame, the Blind, and, far the happiest they!\r\n    The moping Idiot and the Madman gay.\r\n    Here too the Sick their final doom receive,\r\n    Here brought, amid the scenes of grief, to grieve,\r\n    Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow,\r\n    Mixt with the clamours of the crowd below;\r\n    Here sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow scan,\r\n    And the cold charities of man to man:\r\n    Whose laws indeed for ruin’d Age provide,\r\n    And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride;\r\n    But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh,\r\n    And pride embitters what it can’t deny.’[259]\r\n\r\nA good example of this mixture of young and old, virtuous and vicious,\r\nwhole and sick, sane and mad, is given in Eden’s catalogue of the\r\ninmates of Epsom Workhouse in January 1796.[260] There were eleven\r\nmen, sixteen women, and twenty-three children. We read of J. H., aged\r\nforty-three, ‘always ... somewhat of an idiot, he is now become\r\nquite a driveller’; of E. E., aged sixty-two, ‘of a sluggish, stupid\r\ncharacter’; of A. M., aged twenty-six, ‘afflicted with a leprosy’; of\r\nR. M., aged seventy-seven, ‘worn out and paralytic’; of J. R., aged\r\nseventeen, who has contracted so many disorderly habits that decent\r\npeople will not employ him. It is interesting to notice that it was\r\nnot till 1790 that the Justices of the Peace were given any power of\r\ninspecting workhouses.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, before Pitt’s scheme was brought in, the Act of 1722, which\r\nhad been introduced to stiffen the administration of the Poor Laws,\r\nwas relaxed. An Act,[261] of which Sir William Young was the author,\r\nabolished the restriction of right to relief to persons willing to\r\nenter the workhouse, and provided that claimants could apply for relief\r\ndirectly to a magistrate. The Act declares that the restrictions had\r\nbeen found ‘inconvenient and oppressive.’ It is evidence, of course, of\r\nthe increasing pressure of poverty.\r\n\r\nBut to understand the arrangements in force at this time, and also the\r\nlater developments, we must glance at another feature of the Poor Law\r\nsystem. The Poor Laws were a system of employment as well as a system\r\nof relief. The Acts before 1722 are all called Acts for the Relief\r\nof the Poor: the Act of 1722 speaks of ‘the Settlement, Employment\r\nand Relief.’ That Act empowered parishes to farm out the poor to\r\nan employer. Gilbert’s Act of 1782 provided that in the parishes\r\nincorporated under that Act the guardians were not to send able-bodied\r\npoor to the poorhouse, but to find work for them or maintain them until\r\nwork was found: the guardian was to take the wage and provide the\r\nlabourer with a maintenance. Thus there grew up a variety of systems\r\nof public employment: direct employment of paupers on parish work:\r\nthe labour rate system, or the sharing out of the paupers among the\r\nratepayers: the roundsman system by which pauper labour was sold to the\r\nfarmers.[262]\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things that Pitt proposed to reform. His general\r\nideas on Poor Law reform were put before the House of Commons in the\r\ndebate on the second reading of Whitbread’s Bill.[263] He thought that\r\npersons with large families should be treated as entitled to relief,\r\nthat persons without a settlement, falling into want, should not be\r\nliable to removal at the caprice of the parish officer, that Friendly\r\nSocieties should be encouraged, and that Schools of Industry should be\r\nestablished. ‘If any one would take the trouble to compute the amount\r\nof all the earnings of the children who are already educated in this\r\nmanner, he would be surprised, when he came to consider the weight\r\nwhich their support by their own labours took off the country, and the\r\naddition which, by the fruits of their toil, and the habits to which\r\nthey were formed, was made to its internal opulence.’ On 22nd December\r\nof that year, in a new Parliament, he asked for leave to bring in a\r\nBill for the better Support and Maintenance of the Poor. He said the\r\nsubject was too extensive to be discussed at that stage, that he only\r\nproposed that the Bill should be read a first and second time and\r\nsent to a committee where the blanks could be filled up, and the Bill\r\nprinted before the holidays, ‘in order that during the interval of\r\nParliament it might be circulated in the country and undergo the most\r\nserious investigation.’[264] Sheridan hinted that it was unfortunate\r\nfor the poor that Pitt had taken the question out of Whitbread’s hands,\r\nto which Pitt replied that any delay in bringing forward his Bill was\r\ndue to the time spent on taking advice. On 28th February of the next\r\nyear (1797), while strangers were excluded from the Gallery, there\r\noccurred what the _Parliamentary Register_ calls ‘a conversation upon\r\nthe farther consideration of the report of the Poor’s Bill,’ in which\r\nnobody but Pitt defended the Bill, and Sheridan and Joliffe attacked\r\nit. With this its Parliamentary history ends.\r\n\r\nThe main features of the Bill were these.[265] Schools of Industry were\r\nto be established in every parish or group of parishes. These schools\r\nwere to serve two purposes. First, the young were to be trained there\r\n(this idea came, of course, from Locke). Every poor man with more\r\nthan two children who were not self-supporting, and every widow with\r\nmore than one such child, was to be entitled to a weekly allowance in\r\nrespect of each extra child. Every allowance child who was five years\r\nor over was to be sent to the School of Industry, unless his parent\r\ncould instruct and employ him, and the proceeds of his work was to go\r\ntowards the upkeep of the school. Secondly, grown-up people were to\r\nbe employed there. The authorities were to provide ‘a proper stock of\r\nhemp, flax, silk, cotton, wool, iron, leather or other materials, and\r\nalso proper tools and implements for the employment of the poor,’ and\r\nthey were empowered to carry on all trades under this Act, ‘any law or\r\ncustom to the contrary notwithstanding.’ Any person lawfully settled\r\nin a parish was entitled to be employed in the school; any person\r\nresiding in a parish, able and willing to be employed at the usual\r\nrates, was entitled to be employed there when out of work. Poor persons\r\nrefusing to be employed there were not to be entitled to relief. The\r\nauthorities might either pay wages at a rate fixed by the magistrates,\r\nor they might let the employed sell their products and merely repay the\r\nschool for the material, or they might contract to feed them and take\r\na proportion of their receipts. If the wages paid in the school were\r\ninsufficient, they were to be supplemented out of the rates.\r\n\r\nThe proposals for outside relief were briefly and chiefly these. A\r\nperson unable to earn the full rate of wages usually given might\r\ncontract with his employer to work at an inferior rate, and have the\r\nbalance between his earnings and an adequate maintenance made up by\r\nthe parish. Money might be advanced under certain circumstances for\r\nthe purchase of a cow or other animal, if it seemed likely that such a\r\ncourse would enable the recipient to maintain himself without the help\r\nof the parish. The possession of property up to thirty pounds was not\r\nto disqualify a person for relief. A parochial insurance fund was to be\r\ncreated, partly from private subscriptions and partly from the rates.\r\nNo person was to be removed from a parish on account of relief for\r\ntemporary disability or sickness.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated and deadly criticism came from Bentham, who is\r\noften supposed to have killed the Bill. Some of his objections are\r\ncaptious and eristical, and he is a good deal less than just to the\r\ngood elements of the scheme. Pitt deserves credit for one statesmanlike\r\ndiscovery, the discovery that it is bad policy to refuse to help a\r\nman until he is ruined. His cow-money proposal was also conceived in\r\nthe right spirit if its form was impracticable. But the scheme as\r\na whole was confused and incoherent, and it deserved the treatment\r\nit received. It was in truth a huge patchwork, on which the ideas\r\nof living and dead reformers were thrown together without order\r\nor plan. As a consequence, its various parts did not agree. It is\r\nsurprising that the politician who had attacked Whitbread’s Bill as an\r\ninterference with wages could have included in his scheme the proposal\r\nto pay wages in part out of rates. The whole scheme, though it would\r\nhave involved a great expenditure, would have produced very much the\r\nsame result as the Speenhamland system, by virtue of this clause. Pitt\r\nshowed no more judgment or foresight than the least enlightened of\r\nCounty Justices in introducing into a scheme for providing relief, and\r\ndealing with unemployment, a proposal that could only have the effect\r\nof reducing wages. The organisation of Schools of Industry as a means\r\nof dealing with unemployment has sometimes been represented as quite\r\na new proposal, but it was probably based on the suggestion made by\r\nFielding in 1753 in his paper, ‘A proposal for making an effectual\r\nprovision for the poor, for amending their morals, and for rendering\r\nthem useful members of society.’ Fielding proposed the erection of a\r\ncounty workhouse, which was to include a house of correction. He drew\r\nup a sharp and drastic code which would have authorised the committal\r\nto his County House, not only of vagrants, but of persons of low degree\r\nfound harbouring in an ale-house after ten o’clock at night. But the\r\nworkhouse was not merely to be used as a penal settlement, it was\r\nto find work for the unemployed. Any person who was unable to find\r\nemployment in his parish could apply to the minister or churchwardens\r\nfor a pass, and this pass was to give him the right to claim admission\r\nto the County House where he was to be employed. The County House was\r\nalso to be provided with instructors who could teach native and foreign\r\nmanufactures to the inmates. Howlett, one of Pitt’s critics, was\r\nprobably right in thinking that Pitt was reviving this scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Bill excited general opposition. Bentham’s analysis is the most\r\nfamous of the criticisms that have survived, but in some senses\r\nhis opposition was less serious than the dismay of magistrates and\r\nratepayers. Hostile petitions poured into the House of Commons from\r\nLondon and from all parts of the country; among others there were\r\npetitions from Shrewsbury, Oswestry, Worcester, Bristol, Lincoln,\r\nCarmarthen, Bedford, Chester and Godalming.[266] Howlett attacked the\r\nscheme on the ground of the danger of parish jobbery and corruption.\r\nPitt apparently made no attempt to defend his plan, and he surrendered\r\nit without a murmur. We are thus left in the curious and disappointing\r\nposition of having before us a Bill on the most important subject of\r\nthe day, introduced and abandoned by the Prime Minister without a\r\nword or syllable in its defence. Whitbread observed[267] four years\r\nlater that the Bill was brought in and printed, but never brought\r\nunder the discussion of the House. Pitt’s excuse is significant: ‘He\r\nwas, as formerly, convinced of its propriety; but many objections had\r\nbeen started to it by those whose opinion he was bound to respect.\r\nInexperienced himself in country affairs, and in the condition of the\r\npoor, he was diffident of his own opinion, and would not press the\r\nmeasure upon the attention of the House.’\r\n\r\nPoor Law Reform was thus abandoned, but two attempts were made, at the\r\ninstance of Pitt, one of them with success, to soften the brutalities\r\nof the Law of Settlement. Neither proposal made it any easier to gain\r\na settlement, and Pitt very properly declared that they did not go\r\nnearly far enough. Pitt had all Adam Smith’s just hatred of these\r\nrestrictions, and in opposing Whitbread’s Bill for a minimum wage he\r\npointed to ‘a radical amendment’ of the Law of Settlement as the true\r\nremedy. He was not the formal author of the Act of 1795, but it may\r\nsafely be assumed that he was the chief power behind it. This Act[268]\r\nprovided that nobody was to be removeable until he or she became\r\nactually chargeable to the parish. The preamble throws light on the\r\nworking of the Settlement laws. It declares that ‘Many industrious\r\npoor persons, chargeable to the parish, township, or place where they\r\nlive, merely from want of work there, would in any other place where\r\nsufficient employment is to be had, maintain themselves and families\r\nwithout being burthensome to any parish, township, or place; and\r\nsuch poor persons are for the most part compelled to live in their\r\nown parishes, townships, or places, and are not permitted to inhabit\r\nelsewhere, under pretence that they are likely to become chargeable to\r\nthe parish, township, or place into which they go for the purpose of\r\ngetting employment, although the labour of such poor persons might, in\r\nmany instances, be very beneficial to such parish, township, or place.’\r\nThe granting of certificates is thus admitted to have been ineffectual.\r\nThe same Act provided that orders of removal were to be suspended in\r\ncases where the pauper was dangerously ill, a provision that throws\r\nsome light on the manner in which these orders had been executed, and\r\nthat no person should gain a settlement by paying levies or taxes, in\r\nrespect of any tenement of a yearly value of less than ten pounds.[269]\r\n\r\nFrom this time certificates were unnecessary, and if a labourer moved\r\nfrom Parish A to Parish B he was no longer liable to be sent back at\r\nthe caprice of Parish B’s officers until he became actually chargeable,\r\nbut, of course, if from any cause he fell into temporary distress, for\r\nexample, if he were out of work for a few weeks, unless he could get\r\nprivate aid from ‘the opulent,’ he had to return to his old parish.\r\nAn attempt was made to remedy this state of things by Mr. Baker who,\r\nin March 1800, introduced a Bill[270] to enable overseers to assist\r\nthe deserving but unsettled poor in cases of temporary distress. He\r\nexplained that the provisions of the Bill would apply only to men who\r\ncould usually keep themselves, but from the high cost of provisions had\r\nto depend on parochial aid. He found a powerful supporter in Pitt, who\r\nargued that if people had enriched a parish with their industry, it was\r\nunfair that owing to temporary pressure they should be removed to a\r\nplace where they were not wanted, and that it was better for a parish\r\nto suffer temporary inconvenience than for numbers of industrious men\r\nto be rendered unhappy and useless. But in spite of Pitt’s unanswerable\r\ncase, the Bill, which was denounced by Mr. Buxton as oppressive to\r\nthe landed interest, by Lord Sheffield as ‘subversive of the whole\r\neconomy of the country,’ by Mr. Ellison as submerging the middle ranks,\r\nand by Sir William Pulteney as being a ‘premium for idleness and\r\nextravagance,’ was rejected by thirty votes to twenty-three.[271]\r\n\r\n\r\nALLOTMENTS\r\n\r\nAnother policy that was pressed upon the governing class was the policy\r\nof restoring to the labourer some of the resources he had lost with\r\nenclosure, of putting him in such a position that he was not obliged\r\nto depend entirely on the purchasing power of his wages at the shop.\r\nThis was the aim of the allotment movement. The propaganda failed, but\r\nit did not fail for the want of vigorous and authoritative support. We\r\nhave seen in a previous chapter that Arthur Young awoke in 1801 to the\r\nsocial mischief of depriving the poor of their land and their cows,\r\nand that he wanted future Enclosure Acts to be juster and more humane.\r\nCobbett suggested a large scheme of agrarian settlement to Windham in\r\n1806. These proposals had been anticipated by Davies, whose knowledge\r\nof the actual life of the poor made him understand the important\r\ndifference between a total and a partial dependence on wages. ‘Hope is\r\na cordial, of which the poor man has especially much need, to cheer his\r\nheart in the toilsome journey through life. And the fatal consequence\r\nof that policy, which deprives labouring people of the expectation of\r\npossessing any property in the soil, must be the extinction of every\r\ngenerous principle in their minds.... No gentleman should be permitted\r\nto pull down a cottage, until he had first erected another, upon one of\r\nMr. Kent’s plans, either on some convenient part of the waste, or on\r\nhis own estate, with a certain quantity of land annexed.’ He praised\r\nthe Act of Elizabeth which forbade the erection of cottages with less\r\nthan four acres of land around them, ‘that poor people might secure for\r\nthemselves a maintenance, and not be obliged on the loss of a few days\r\nlabour to come to the parish,’[272] and urged that this prohibition,\r\nwhich had been repealed in 1775,[273] should be set up again.\r\n\r\nThe general policy of providing allotments was never tried, but we\r\nknow something of individual experiments from the Reports of the\r\nSociety for Bettering the Condition and Increasing the Comforts of the\r\nPoor. This society took up the cause of allotments very zealously, and\r\nmost of the examples of private benevolence seem to have found their\r\nway into the pages of its reports.\r\n\r\nThese experiments were not very numerous. Indeed, the name of Lord\r\nWinchilsea recurs so inevitably in every allusion to the subject as to\r\ncreate a suspicion that the movement and his estates were coextensive.\r\nThis is not the truth, but it is not very wide of the truth, for\r\nthough Lord Winchilsea had imitators, those imitators were few. The\r\nfullest account of his estate in Rutlandshire is given by Sir Thomas\r\nBernard.[274] The estate embraced four parishes--Hambledon, Egleton,\r\nGreetham, and Burley on the Hill. The tenants included eighty cottagers\r\npossessing one hundred and seventy-four cows. ‘About a third part\r\nhave all their land in severalty; the rest of them have the use of a\r\ncow-pasture in common with others; most of them possessing a small\r\nhomestead, adjoining to their cottage; every one of them having a\r\ngood garden, and keeping one pig at least, if not more.... Of all the\r\nrents of the estate, none are more punctually paid than those for the\r\ncottagers’ land.’ In this happy district if a man seemed likely to\r\nbecome a burden on the parish his landlord and neighbours saved the\r\nman’s self-respect and their own pockets as ratepayers, by setting\r\nhim up with land and a cow instead. So far from neglecting their work\r\nas labourers, these proprietors of cows are described as ‘most steady\r\nand trusty.’ We have a picture of this little community leading a\r\nhard but energetic and independent life, the men going out to daily\r\nwork, but busy in their spare hours with their cows, sheep, pigs, and\r\ngardens; the women and children looking after the live stock, spinning,\r\nor working in the gardens: a very different picture from that of the\r\nlandless and ill-fed labourers elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOther landlords, who, acting on their own initiative, or at the\r\ninstance of their agents, helped their cottagers by letting them land\r\non which to keep cows were Lord Carrington and Lord Scarborough in\r\nLincolnshire, and Lord Egremont on his Yorkshire estates (Kent was his\r\nagent). Some who were friendly to the allotments movement thought it a\r\nmistake to give allotments of arable land in districts where pasture\r\nland was not available. Mr. Thompson, who writes the account of Lord\r\nCarrington’s cottagers with cows, thought that ‘where cottagers occupy\r\narable land, it is very rarely of advantage to them, and generally a\r\nprejudice to the estate.’[275] He seems, however, to have been thinking\r\nmore of small holdings than of allotments. ‘The late Abel Smith,\r\nEsq., from motives of kindness to several cottagers on his estates in\r\nNottinghamshire, let to each of them a small piece of arable land. I\r\nhave rode over that estate with Lord Carrington several times since it\r\ndescended to him, and I have invariably observed that the tenants upon\r\nit, who occupy only eight or ten acres of arable land, are poor, and\r\ntheir land in bad condition. They would thrive more and enjoy greater\r\ncomfort with the means of keeping two or three cows each than with\r\nthree times their present quantity of arable land; but it would be a\r\ngreater mortification to them to be deprived of it than their landlord\r\nis disposed to inflict.’[276] On the other hand, a striking instance\r\nof successful arable allotments is described by a Mr. Estcourt in the\r\nReports of the Society for Bettering the Condition of the Poor.[277]\r\nThe scene was the parish of Long Newnton in Wilts, which contained\r\none hundred and forty poor persons, chiefly agricultural labourers,\r\ndistributed in thirty-two families, and the year was 1800. The price of\r\nprovisions was very high, and ‘though all had a very liberal allowance\r\nfrom the poor rate’ the whole village was plunged in debt and misery.\r\nFrom this hopeless plight the parish was rescued by an allotment scheme\r\nthat Mr. Estcourt established and described. Each cottager who applied\r\nwas allowed to rent a small quantity of land at the rate of £1, 12s. an\r\nacre[278] on a fourteen years’ lease: the quantity of land let to an\r\napplicant depended on the number in his family, with a maximum of one\r\nand a half acres: the tenant was to forfeit his holding if he received\r\npoor relief other than medical relief. The offer was greedily accepted,\r\ntwo widows with large families and four very old and infirm persons\r\nbeing the only persons who did not apply for a lease. A loan of £44\r\nwas divided among the tenants to free them from their debts and give\r\nthem a fresh start. They were allowed a third of their plot on Lady\r\nDay 1801, a second third on Lady Day 1802, and the remainder on Lady\r\nDay 1803. The results as recorded in 1805 were astonishing. None of\r\nthe tenants had received any poor relief: all the conditions had been\r\nobserved: the loan of £44 had long been repaid and the poor rate had\r\nfallen from £212, 16s. to £12, 6s. ‘They are so much beforehand with\r\nthe world that it is supposed that it must be some calamity still more\r\nsevere than any they have ever been afflicted with that could put them\r\nunder the necessity of ever applying for relief to the parish again....\r\nThe farmers of this parish allow that they never had their work better\r\ndone, their servants more able, willing, civil, and sober, and that\r\ntheir property was never so free from depredation as at present.’[279]\r\n\r\nSome philanthropists, full of the advantages to the poor of possessing\r\nlive-stock, argued that it was a good thing for cottagers to keep\r\ncows even in arable districts. Sir Henry Vavasour wrote an account in\r\n1801[280] of one of his cottagers who managed to keep two cows and two\r\npigs and make a profit of £30 a year on three acres three perches of\r\narable with a summer’s gait for one of his cows. The man, his wife, and\r\nhis daughter of twelve worked on the land in their spare hours. The\r\nBoard of Agriculture offered gold medals in 1801 for the best report of\r\nhow to keep one or two cows on arable land, and Sir John Sinclair wrote\r\nan essay on the subject, reproduced in the account of ‘Useful Projects’\r\nin the _Annual Register_.[281] Sir John Sinclair urged that if the\r\nsystem was generally adopted it would remove the popular objections to\r\nenclosure.\r\n\r\nOther advocates of the policy of giving the labourers land pleaded only\r\nfor gardens in arable districts; ‘a garden,’ wrote Lord Winchilsea,\r\n‘may be allotted to them in almost every situation, and will be found\r\nof infinite use to them. In countries, where it has never been the\r\ncustom for labourers to keep cows, it may be difficult to introduce\r\nit; but where no gardens have been annexed to the cottages, it is\r\nsufficient to give the ground, and the labourer is sure to know what\r\nto do with it, and will reap an immediate benefit from it. Of this I\r\nhave had experience in several places, particularly in two parishes\r\nnear Newport Pagnell, Bucks, where there never have been any gardens\r\nannexed to the labourers’ houses, and where, upon land being allotted\r\nto them, they all, without a single exception, have cultivated their\r\ngardens extremely well, and profess receiving the greatest benefits\r\nfrom them.’[282] ‘A few roods of land, at a fair rent,’ wrote a\r\ncorrespondent in the _Annals of Agriculture_ in 1796,[283] ‘would do\r\na labourer as much good as wages almost doubled: there would not,\r\nthen, be an idle hand in his family, and the man himself would often\r\ngo to work in his root yard instead of going to the ale house.’[284]\r\nThe interesting report on the ‘Inquiry into the General State of the\r\nPoor’ presented at the Epiphany General Quarter Sessions for Hampshire\r\nand published in the _Annals of Agriculture_,[285] a document which\r\ndoes not display too much indulgence to the shortcomings of labourers,\r\nrecommends the multiplication of cottages with small pieces of ground\r\nannexed, so that labourers might live nearer their work, and spend\r\nthe time often wasted in going to and from their work, in cultivating\r\ntheir plot of ground at home. ‘As it is chiefly this practice which\r\nrenders even the state of slavery in the West Indies tolerable, what an\r\nadvantage would it be to the state of free service here!’[286]\r\n\r\nThe experiments in the provision of allotments of any kind were few,\r\nand they are chiefly interesting for the light they reflect on the\r\ncharacter of the labourer of the period. They show of what those\r\nmen and women were capable whose degradation in the morass of the\r\nSpeenhamland system is the last and blackest page in the history of\r\nthe eighteenth century. Their rulers put a stone round their necks,\r\nand it was not their character but their circumstances that dragged\r\nthem into the mire. In villages where allotments were tried the\r\nagricultural labourer is an upright and self-respecting figure. The\r\nimmediate moral effects were visible enough at the time. Sir Thomas\r\nBernard’s account of the cottagers on Lord Winchilsea’s estate contains\r\nthe following reflections: ‘I do not mean to assert that the English\r\ncottager, narrowed as he now is in the means and habits of life, may\r\nbe immediately capable of taking that active and useful station in\r\nsociety, that is filled by those who are the subject of this paper.\r\nTo produce so great an improvement in character and circumstances of\r\nlife, will require time and attention. The cottager, however, of\r\nthis part of the county of Rutland, _is not of a different species\r\nfrom other English cottagers_; and if he had not been protected and\r\nencouraged by his landlord, he would have been the same hopeless and\r\ncomfortless creature that we see in some other parts of England. The\r\nfarmer (with the assistance of the steward) would have taken his land;\r\nthe creditor, his cow and pig; and the workhouse, his family.’[287]\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in discussing enclosures, that the policy of securing\r\nallotments to the labourers in enclosure Acts was defeated by the class\r\ninterests of the landlords. Why, it may be asked, were schemes such\r\nas those of Lord Winchilsea’s adopted so rarely in villages already\r\nenclosed? These arrangements benefited all parties. There was no\r\ndoubt about the demand; ‘in the greatest part of this kingdom,’ wrote\r\none correspondent, ‘the cottager would rejoice at being permitted to\r\npay the utmost value given by the farmers, for as much land as would\r\nkeep a cow, if he could obtain it at that price.’[288] The steadiness\r\nand industry of the labourers, stimulated by this incentive, were\r\nan advantage both to the landlords and to the farmers. Further, it\r\nwas well known that in the villages where the labourers had land,\r\npoor rates were light.[289] Why was it that a policy with so many\r\nrecommendations never took root? Perhaps the best answer is given in\r\nthe following story. Cobbett proposed to the vestry of Bishops Walthams\r\nthat they should ‘ask the Bishop of Winchester to grant an acre of\r\nwaste land to every married labourer. All, however, but the village\r\nschoolmaster voted against it, on the ground ... that it would make the\r\nmen “too saucy,” that they would “breed more children” and “want higher\r\nwages.”’[290]\r\n\r\nThe truth is that enclosures and the new system of farming had set up\r\ntwo classes in antagonism to allotments, the large farmer, who disliked\r\nsaucy labourers, and the shopkeeper, who knew that the more food the\r\nlabourer raised on his little estate the less would he buy at the\r\nvillage store. It had been to the interest of a small farmer in the old\r\ncommon-field village to have a number of semi-labourers, semi-owners\r\nwho could help at the harvest: the large farmer wanted a permanent\r\nsupply of labour which was absolutely at his command. Moreover, the\r\nroundsman system maintained his labourers for him when he did not\r\nwant them. The strength of the hostility of the farmers to allotments\r\nis seen in the language of those few landlords who were interested\r\nin this policy. Lord Winchilsea and his friends were always urging\r\nphilanthropists to proceed with caution, and to try to reason the\r\nfarmers out of their prejudices. The Report of the Poor Law Commission\r\nin 1834 showed that these prejudices were as strong as ever. ‘We can do\r\nlittle or nothing to prevent pauperism; the farmers will have it: they\r\nprefer that the labourers should be slaves; they object to their having\r\ngardens, saying “The more they work for themselves, the less they work\r\nfor us.”’[291] This was the view of Boys, the writer in agricultural\r\nsubjects, who, criticising Kent’s declaration in favour of allotments,\r\nremarks: ‘If farmers in general were to accommodate their labourers\r\nwith two acres of land, a cow and two or three pigs, they would\r\nprobably have more difficulty in getting their hard work done--as the\r\ncow, land, etc., would enable them to live with less earnings.’[292]\r\nArthur Young and Nathaniel Kent made a great appeal to landlords and to\r\nlandlords’ wives to interest themselves in their estates and the people\r\nwho lived on them, but landlords’ bailiffs did not like the trouble of\r\ncollecting a number of small rents, and most landlords preferred to\r\nleave their labourers to the mercy of the farmers. There was, however,\r\none form of allotment that the farmers themselves liked: they would\r\nlet strips of potato ground to labourers, sometimes at four times the\r\nrent they paid themselves, getting the land manured and dug into the\r\nbargain.[293]\r\n\r\nThe Select Vestry Act of 1819[294] empowered parishes to buy or lease\r\ntwenty acres of land, and to set the indigent poor to work on it, or\r\nto lease it out to any poor and industrious inhabitant. A later Act of\r\n1831[295] raised the limit from twenty to fifty acres, and empowered\r\nparishes to enclose fifty acres of waste (with the consent of those who\r\nhad rights on it) and to lease it out for the same purposes. Little\r\nuse was made of these Acts, and perhaps the clearest light is thrown\r\non the extent of the allotment movement by a significant sentence\r\nthat occurs in the Report of the Select Committee on Allotments in\r\n1843. ‘It was not until 1830, when discontent had been so painfully\r\nexhibited amongst the peasantry of the southern counties that this\r\nmethod of alleviating their situation was much resorted to.’ In other\r\nwords, little was done till labourers desperate with hunger had set the\r\nfarmers’ ricks blazing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REMEDY ADOPTED. SPEENHAMLAND\r\n\r\nThe history has now been given of the several proposals made at this\r\ntime that for one reason or another fell to the ground. A minimum wage\r\nwas not fixed, allotments were only sprinkled with a sparing hand on an\r\nestate here and there, there was no revolution in diet, the problems of\r\nlocal supply and distribution were left untouched, the reconstruction\r\nof the Poor Law was abandoned. What means then did the governing class\r\ntake to tranquillise a population made dangerous by hunger? The answer\r\nis, of course, the Speenhamland Act. The Berkshire J.P.’s and some\r\ndiscreet persons met at the Pelican Inn at Speenhamland[296] on 6th\r\nMay 1795, and there resolved on a momentous policy which was gradually\r\nadopted in almost every part of England.\r\n\r\nThere is a strange irony in the story of this meeting which gave such\r\na fatal impetus to the reduction of wages. It was summoned in order to\r\nraise wages, and so make the labourer independent of parish relief. At\r\nthe General Quarter Sessions for Berkshire held at Newbury on the 14th\r\nApril, Charles Dundas, M.P.,[297] in his charge to the Grand Jury[298]\r\ndwelt on the miserable state of the labourers and the necessity of\r\nincreasing their wages to subsistence level, instead of leaving them\r\nto resort to the parish officers for support for their families, as\r\nwas the case when they worked for a shilling a day. He quoted the\r\nActs of Elizabeth and James with reference to the fixing of wages.\r\nThe Court, impressed by his speech, decided to convene a meeting for\r\nthe rating of wages. The advertisement of the meeting shows that this\r\nwas the only object in view. ‘At the General Quarter Sessions of the\r\nPeace for this county held at Newbury, on Tuesday, the 14th instant,\r\nthe Court, having taken into consideration the great Inequality of\r\nLabourers’ Wages, and the insufficiency of the same for the necessary\r\nsupport of an industrious man and his family; and it being the opinion\r\nof the Gentlemen assembled on the Grand Jury, that many parishes\r\nhave not advanced their labourers’ weekly pay in proportion to the\r\nhigh price of corn and provisions, do (in pursuance of the Acts of\r\nParliament, enabling and requiring them so to do, either at the Easter\r\nSessions, yearly, or within six weeks next after) earnestly request the\r\nattendance of the Sheriff, and all the Magistrates of this County, at\r\na Meeting intended to be held at the Pelican Inn in Speenhamland, on\r\nWednesday, the sixth day of May next, at ten o’clock in the forenoon,\r\nfor the purpose of consulting together with such discreet persons as\r\nthey shall think meet, and they will then, having respect to the plenty\r\nand scarcity of the time, and other circumstances (if approved of)\r\nproceed to limit, direct, and appoint the wages of day labourers.’[299]\r\n\r\nThe meeting was duly held on 6th May.[300] Mr. Charles Dundas was in\r\nthe chair, and there were seventeen other magistrates and discreet\r\npersons present, of whom seven were clergymen. It was resolved\r\nunanimously ‘that the present state of the poor does require further\r\nassistance than has been generally given them.’ Of the details of the\r\ndiscussion no records have come down to us, nor do we know by what\r\nmajority the second and fatal resolution rejecting the rating of wages\r\nand substituting an allowance policy was adopted. According to Eden,\r\nthe arguments in favour of adopting the rating of wages were ‘that\r\nby enforcing a payment for labour, from the employers, in proportion\r\nto the price of bread, some encouragement would have been held out\r\nto the labourer, as what he would have received, would have been\r\npayment for labour. He would have considered it as his right, and\r\nnot as charity.’[301] But these arguments were rejected, and a pious\r\nrecommendation to employers to raise wages, coupled with detailed\r\ndirections for supplementing those wages from parish funds, adopted\r\ninstead.[302] The text of the second resolution runs thus: ‘Resolved,\r\nthat it is not expedient for the Magistrates to grant that assistance\r\nby regulating the wages of Day Labourers according to the directions of\r\nthe Statutes of the 5th Elizabeth and 1st James: But the Magistrates\r\nvery earnestly recommend to the Farmers and others throughout the\r\ncounty to increase the Pay of their Labourers in proportion to the\r\npresent Price of Provisions; and agreeable thereto the Magistrates now\r\npresent have unanimously Resolved, That they will in their several\r\ndivisions, make the following calculations and allowances for the\r\nrelief of all poor and industrious men and their families, who, to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Justices of their parish, shall endeavour (as far\r\nas they can), for their own support and maintenance, that is to say,\r\nwhen the gallon loaf of second flour, weighing 8 lbs. 11 oz. shall\r\ncost one shilling, then every poor and industrious man shall have for\r\nhis own support 3s. weekly, either produced by his own or his family’s\r\nlabour or an allowance from the poor rates, and for the support of his\r\nwife and every other of his family 1s. 6d. When the gallon loaf shall\r\ncost 1s. 4d., then every poor and industrious man shall have 4s. weekly\r\nfor his own, and 1s. 10d. for the support of every other of his family.\r\n\r\n‘And so in proportion as the price of bread rises or falls (that is to\r\nsay), 3d. to the man and 1d. to every other of the family, on every\r\npenny which the loaf rises above a shilling.’\r\n\r\nIn other words, it was estimated that the man must have three gallon\r\nloaves a week, and his wife and each child one and a half.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that at this same famous Speenhamland\r\nmeeting the justices ‘wishing, as much as possible, to alleviate the\r\nDistresses of the Poor with as little burthen on the occupiers of the\r\nLand as possible’ recommended overseers to cultivate land for potatoes\r\nand to give the workers a quarter of the crop, selling the rest at one\r\nshilling a bushel; overseers were also recommended to purchase fuel and\r\nto retail it at a loss.\r\n\r\nThe Speenhamland policy was not a full-blown invention of that unhappy\r\nMay morning in the Pelican Inn. The principle had already been adopted\r\nelsewhere. At the Oxford Quarter Sessions on 13th January 1795, the\r\njustices had resolved that the following incomes were ‘absolutely\r\nnecessary for the support of the poor, industrious labourer, and that\r\nwhen the utmost industry of a family cannot produce the undermentioned\r\nsums, it must be made up by the overseer, exclusive of rent, viz.:--\r\n\r\n‘A single Man according to his labour.\r\n\r\n‘A Man and his Wife not less than 6s. a week.\r\n\r\n‘A Man and his Wife with one or two Small Children, not less than 7s. a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n‘And for every additional Child not less than 1s. a week.’ This\r\nregulation was to be sent to all overseers within the county.[303]\r\n\r\nBut the Speenhamland magistrates had drawn up a table which became\r\na convenient standard, and other magistrates found it the simplest\r\ncourse to accept the table as it stood. The tables passed rapidly from\r\ncounty to county. The allowance system spread like a fever, for while\r\nit is true to say that the northern counties took it much later and\r\nin a milder form, there were only two counties still free from it in\r\n1834--Northumberland and Durham.\r\n\r\nTo complete our picture of the new system we must remember the results\r\nof Gilbert’s Act. It had been the practice in those parishes that\r\nadopted the Act to reserve the workhouse for the infirm and to find\r\nwork outside for the unemployed, the parish receiving the wages of\r\nsuch employment and providing maintenance. This outside employment\r\nhad spread to other parishes, and the way in which it had been worked\r\nmay be illustrated by cases mentioned by Eden, writing in the summer\r\nand autumn of 1795. At Kibworth-Beauchamp in Leicestershire, ‘in the\r\nwinter, and at other times, when a man is out of work, he applies to\r\nthe overseer, who sends him from house to house to get employ: the\r\nhousekeeper, who employs him, is obliged to give him victuals, and 6d.\r\na day; and the parish adds 4d.; (total 10d. a day;) for the support\r\nof his family: persons working in this manner are called rounds-men,\r\nfrom their going round the village or township for employ.’[304] At\r\nYardley Goben, in Northamptonshire, every person who paid more than\r\n£20 rent was bound in his turn to employ a man for a day and to pay\r\nhim a shilling.[305] At Maids Morton the roundsman got 6d. from the\r\nemployer and 6d. or 9d. from the parish.[306] At Winslow in Bucks the\r\nsystem was more fully developed. ‘There seems to be here a great want\r\nof employment: most labourers are (as it is termed,) _on the Rounds_;\r\nthat is, they go to work from one house to another _round_ the parish.\r\nIn winter, sometimes 40 persons are on the rounds. They are wholly paid\r\nby the parish, unless the householders choose to employ them; and from\r\nthese circumstances, labourers often become very lazy, and imperious.\r\nChildren, about ten years old, are put on the rounds, and receive\r\nfrom the parish from 1s. 6d. to 3s. a week.’[307] The Speenhamland\r\nsystematised scale was easily grafted on to these arrangements. ‘During\r\nthe late dear season, the Poor of the parish went in a body to the\r\nJustices, to complain of their want of bread. The Magistrates sent\r\norders to the parish officers to raise the earnings of labourers, to\r\ncertain weekly sums, according to the number of their children; a\r\ncircumstance that should invariably be attended to in apportioning\r\nparochial relief. These sums were from 7s. to 19s.; and were to be\r\nreduced, proportionably with the price of bread.’[308]\r\n\r\nThe Speenhamland system did not then spring Athene-like out of the\r\nheads of the justices and other discreet persons whose place of meeting\r\nhas given the system its name. Neither was the unemployment policy\r\nthereafter adopted a sudden inspiration of the Parliament of 1796. The\r\nimportance of these years is that though the governing classes did\r\nnot then introduce a new principle, they applied to the normal case\r\nmethods of relief and treatment that had hitherto been reserved for the\r\nexceptions. The Poor Law which had once been the hospital became now\r\nthe prison of the poor. Designed to relieve his necessities, it was now\r\nhis bondage. If a labourer was in private employment, the difference\r\nbetween the wage his master chose to give him and the recognised\r\nminimum was made up by the parish. Those labourers who could not find\r\nprivate employment were either shared out among the ratepayers, or else\r\ntheir labour was sold by the parish to employers, at a low rate, the\r\nparish contributing what was needed to bring the labourers’ receipts up\r\nto scale. Crabbe has described the roundsman system:\r\n\r\n    ‘Alternate Masters now their Slave command,\r\n    Urge the weak efforts of his feeble hand,\r\n    And when his age attempts its task in vain,\r\n    With ruthless taunts, of lazy poor complain.’[309]\r\n\r\nThe meshes of the Poor Law were spread over the entire labour system.\r\nThe labourers, stripped of their ancient rights and their ancient\r\npossessions, refused a minimum wage and allotments, were given instead\r\na universal system of pauperism. This was the basis on which the\r\ngoverning class rebuilt the English village. Many critics, Arthur\r\nYoung and Malthus among them, assailed it, but it endured for forty\r\nyears, and it was not disestablished until Parliament itself had passed\r\nthrough a revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[184] Eden, vol. i. p. 495.\r\n\r\n[185] Resolution of Privy Council, July 6, 1795, and Debate and\r\nResolution in House of Commons. _Parliamentary Register_, December 11,\r\n1795, and Lord Sheffield in _Annals of Agriculture_, vol. xxv. p. 31.\r\n\r\n[186] See _Senator_ for March 1, 1796, p. 1147.\r\n\r\n[187] See Wilberforce’s speech, _Parliamentary Register_ and _Senator_,\r\nFebruary 18, 1800.\r\n\r\n[188] Eden, vol. ii. pp. 104-6.\r\n\r\n[189] _Ibid._, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[190] _Ibid._, p. 280.\r\n\r\n[191] _Ibid._, p. 426.\r\n\r\n[192] See _Annals of Agriculture_, vol. xxiv. pp. 63, 171, 177, 204,\r\n285, 316, etc.\r\n\r\n[193] _Annals of Agriculture_, vol. xxv. p. 678.\r\n\r\n[194] Eden, vol. i. p. 533.\r\n\r\n[195] Perhaps the unpopularity of soup is partly explained by a letter\r\npublished in the _Annals of Agriculture_ in December 1795, vol. xxvi.\r\np. 215.

Mrs. Shore’s account\r\nof stewed ox’s head for the poor, according to which, at the cost of\r\n2s. 6d. with the leavings of the family, a savoury mess for fifty-two\r\npersons could be prepared (_Ibid._, p. 60).\r\n\r\n[196] Davies, pp. 31-2.\r\n\r\n[197] _Annals of Agriculture_, vol. xxv. p. 455.\r\n\r\n[198] _Parliamentary Register_, November 2, 1795.\r\n\r\n[199] Eden, vol. iii. p. 769.\r\n\r\n[200] _Ibid._, vol. ii. p. 97.\r\n\r\n[201] _Ibid._, p. 621.\r\n\r\n[202] _Ibid._, p. 645.\r\n\r\n[203] In many budgets no milk is included.\r\n\r\n[204] _Reports on Poor_, vol. iv. p. 151.\r\n\r\n[205] Davies, p. 104.\r\n\r\n[206] _Reports on Poor_, vol. ii. p. 178.\r\n\r\n[207] Vol. ii. p. 587.\r\n\r\n[208] _Reports on Poor_, vol. i. p. 134; another reason for the dearth\r\nof milk was the growing consumption of veal in the towns.

Retail cheese of an inferior sort had risen from\r\n2-1/2d. or 3d. a lb. to 4-1/2d. or 5d. (p. 65); cf. also correspondent\r\nin _Annals of Agriculture_, vol. ii. p. 442. ‘Every inhabitant of Bath\r\nmust be sensible that butter and cheese have risen in price one-third,\r\nor more, within these twenty years.’ (Written in 1784).\r\n\r\n[217] _Reports on Poor_, vol. i. p. 129.\r\n\r\n[218] _Ibid._, vol. iii. p. 78.\r\n\r\n[219] _Annual Register_, 1806, p. 974; ‘My local situation afforded\r\nme ample means of knowing how greatly the lower orders suffered from\r\nbeing unable to procure a supply of milk; and I am fully persuaded of\r\nthe correctness of the statement that the labouring poor lose a number\r\nof their children from the want of a food so pre-eminently adapted to\r\ntheir support’; cf. also Curwen’s _Hints_.\r\n\r\n[220] Eden, vol. i. p. 510.\r\n\r\n[221] Vol. iii. p. 96.\r\n\r\n[222] Eden, vol. iii. p. 694.\r\n\r\n[223] Cf. _Reports on Poor_, vol. i. p. 43; ‘Where there are commons,\r\nthe ideal advantage of cutting flags, peat, or whins, often causes\r\na poor man to spend more time in procuring such fuel, than, if he\r\nreckoned his labour, would purchase for him double the quantity of good\r\nfiring.’\r\n\r\n[224] Vol. iv. p. 496.\r\n\r\n[225] Vol. ii. p. 587.\r\n\r\n[226] Davies, p. 28.\r\n\r\n[227] _Ibid._, p. 118.\r\n\r\n[228] Eden, vol. iii. p. 805.\r\n\r\n[229] P. 179.\r\n\r\n[230] Cf. also Eden’s description of a labourer’s expenses, vol. iii.\r\np. 797, where he says that whilst hedging and ditching, they are\r\nallowed to take home a faggot every evening, whilst the work lasts,\r\n‘but this is by no means sufficient for his consumption: his children,\r\ntherefore, are sent into the fields, to collect wood where they can;\r\nand neither hedges nor trees are spared by the young marauders, who are\r\nthus, in some degree, educated in the art of thieving.’\r\n\r\n[231] Vol. ii. p. 231.\r\n\r\n[232] Cf. also for the difficulties of the poor in getting fuel, the\r\naccount by the Rev.

This\r\nview overlooks the predicament in which these classes found themselves\r\nat the end of the eighteenth century. We will try to reconstruct the\r\nsituation and to reproduce their state of mind. Agriculture, which\r\nhad hitherto provided most people with a livelihood, but few people\r\nwith vast fortunes, had become by the end of the century a great\r\ncapitalist and specialised industry. During the French war its profits\r\nwere fabulous, and they were due partly to enclosures, partly to the\r\nintroduction of scientific methods, partly to the huge prices caused\r\nby the war. It was producing thus a vast surplus over and above the\r\nproduct necessary for maintenance and for wear and tear. Consequently,\r\nas students of Mr. Hobson’s _Industrial System_ will perceive, there\r\narose an important social problem of distribution, and the Poor Law was\r\nclosely involved with it.\r\n\r\nThis industry maintained, or helped to maintain, four principal\r\ninterests: the landlords, the tithe-owners, the farmers, and the\r\nlabourers. Of these interests the first two were represented in the\r\ngoverning class, and in considering the mind of that class we may\r\nmerge them into one. The sympathies of the farmers were rather with\r\nthe landlords than with the labourers, but their interests were not\r\nidentical. The labourers were unrepresented either in the Government or\r\nin the voting power of the nation. If the forces had been more equally\r\nmatched, or if Parliament had represented all classes, the surplus\r\nincome of agriculture would have gone to increase rents, tithes,\r\nprofits, and wages. It might, besides turning the landlords into great\r\nmagnates like the cotton lords of Lancashire, and throwing up a race of\r\nfarmers with scarlet coats and jack boots, have raised permanently the\r\nstandard and character of the labouring class, have given them a decent\r\nwage and decent cottages. The village population whose condition, as\r\nWhitbread said, was compared by supporters of the slave trade with that\r\nof the negroes in the West Indies, to its disadvantage, might have been\r\nrehoused on its share of this tremendous revenue. In fact, the revenue\r\nwent solely to increase rent, tithes, and to some extent profits.\r\nThe labourers alone had made no advance when the halcyon days of the\r\nindustry clouded over and prices fell. The rent receiver received\r\nmore rent than was needed to induce him to let his land, the farmer\r\nmade larger profits than were necessary to induce him to apply his\r\ncapital and ability to farming, but the labourer received less than was\r\nnecessary to maintain him, the balance being made up out of the rates.\r\nThus not only did the labourer receive no share of this surplus; he did\r\nnot even get his subsistence directly from the product of his labour.\r\nNow let us suppose that instead of having his wages made up out of the\r\nrates he had been paid a maintenance wage by the farmer. The extra cost\r\nwould have come out of rent to the same extent as did the subsidy from\r\nthe rates. The landlord therefore made no sacrifice in introducing the\r\nSpeenhamland system, for though the farmers thought that they could\r\nobtain a reduction of rent more easily if they could plead high rates\r\nthan if they pleaded the high price of labour,[310] it is obvious that\r\nthe same conditions which produced a reduction of rents in the one case\r\nmust ultimately have produced a reduction in the other. As it was, none\r\nof this surplus went to labour, and the proportion in which it was\r\ndivided between landlord and farmer was not affected by the fact that\r\nthe labourer was kept alive partly from the rates and not wholly from\r\nwages.[311]\r\n\r\nNow the governing class which was confronted with the situation that\r\nwe have described in a previous chapter consisted of two classes who\r\nhad both contrived to slip off their obligations to the State. They\r\nwere both essentially privileged classes. The landlords were not\r\nin the eye of history absolute owners; they had held their land on\r\nseveral conditions, one of which was the liability to provide military\r\nservices for the Crown, and this obligation they had commuted into a\r\ntax on the nation. The tithe-owners had for centuries appropriated to\r\ntheir own use a revenue that was designed in part for the poor. Tithes\r\nwere originally taxation for four objects: (1) the bishop; (2) the\r\nmaintenance of the fabric of the Church; (3) the relief of the poor;\r\n(4) the incumbent. After the endowment of the bishopricks the first of\r\nthese objects dropped out. The poor had not a very much longer life.\r\nIt is true that the clergy were bidden much later to use tithes, _non\r\nquasi suis sed quasi commendatis_, and Dryden in his character of the\r\nGood Parson had described their historical obligations:\r\n\r\n    ‘True priests, he said, and preachers of the Word\r\n    Were only stewards of their sovereign Lord:\r\n    Nothing was theirs but all the public store,\r\n    Intrusted riches to relieve the poor.’\r\n\r\nThe right of the poor to an allowance from the tithes was declared in\r\nan Act of Richard II. and an Act of Henry IV. After that it disappears\r\nfrom view. Of course, great masses of tithe property had passed, by\r\nthe time we are considering, into secular hands. The monasteries\r\nappropriated about a third of the livings of England, and the tithes\r\nin these parishes passed at the Reformation to the Crown, whence they\r\npassed in grants to private persons. No responsibility for the poor\r\ntroubled either the lay or spiritual owners of tithes, and though\r\nthey used the name of God freely in defending their claims, they were\r\nstewards of God in much the same sense as George IV. was the defender\r\nof the faith. The landowners and tithe-owners had their differences\r\nwhen it came to an Enclosure Bill, but these classes had the same\r\ninterests in the disposal of the surplus profits of agriculture; and\r\nboth alike were in a vulnerable position if the origin and history of\r\ntheir property came under too fierce a discussion.\r\n\r\nThere was a special reason why the classes that had suddenly become\r\nvery much richer should dread too searching a discontent at this\r\nmoment. They had seen tithes, and all seignorial dues abolished\r\nalmost at a single stroke across the Channel, and they were at this\r\ntime associating constantly with the emigrant nobility of France,\r\nwhose prospect of recovering their estates seemed to fade into a more\r\ndoubtful distance with every battle that was fought between the France\r\nwho had given the poor peasant such a position as the peasant enjoyed\r\nnowhere else, and her powerful neighbour who had made her landlords\r\nthe richest and proudest class in Europe. The French Convention had\r\npassed a decree (November 1792), declaring that ‘wherever French\r\narmies shall come, all taxes, tithes, and privileges of rank are to\r\nbe abolished, all existing authorities cancelled, and provisional\r\nadministrations elected by universal suffrage. The property of the\r\nfallen Government, of the privileged classes and their adherents to be\r\nplaced under French protection.’ This last sentence had an unpleasant\r\nring about it; it sounded like a terse paraphrase of _non quasi suis\r\nsed quasi commendatis_. In point of fact there was not yet any violent\r\ncriticism of the basis of the social position of the privileged classes\r\nin England. Even Paine, when he suggested a scheme of Old Age Pensions\r\nfor all over fifty, and a dowry for every one on reaching the age of\r\ntwenty-one, had proposed to finance it by death duties. Thelwall,\r\nwho wrote with a not unnatural bitterness about the great growth of\r\nostentatious wealth at a time when the poor were becoming steadily\r\npoorer, told a story which illustrated very well the significance of\r\nthe philanthropy of the rich. ‘I remember I was once talking to a\r\nfriend of the charity and benevolence exhibited in this country, when\r\nstopping me with a sarcastic sneer, “Yes,” says he, “we steal the\r\ngoose, and we give back the giblets.” “No,” said a third person who was\r\nstanding by, “giblets are much too dainty for the common herd, we give\r\nthem only the pen feathers.”’[312] But the literature of Radicalism\r\nwas not inflammatory, and the demands of the dispossessed were for\r\nsomething a good deal less than their strict due. The richer classes,\r\nhowever, were naturally anxious to soothe and pacify the poor before\r\ndiscontent spread any further, and the Speenhamland system turned out,\r\nfrom their point of view, a very admirable means to that end, for it\r\nprovided a maintenance for the poor by a method which sapped their\r\nspirit and disarmed their independence. They were anxious that the\r\nlabourers should not get into the way of expecting a larger share in\r\nthe profits of agriculture, and at the same time they wanted to make\r\nthem contented. Thelwall[313] stated that when he was in the Isle of\r\nWight, the farmers came to a resolution to raise the price of labour,\r\nand that they were dissuaded by one of the greatest proprietors in the\r\nisland, who called a meeting and warned the farmers that they would\r\nmake the common people insolent and would never be able to reduce their\r\nwages again.\r\n\r\nAn account of the introduction of the system into Warwickshire and\r\nWorcestershire illustrates very well the state of mind in which this\r\npolicy had its origin. ‘In Warwickshire, the year 1797 was mentioned\r\nas the date of its commencement in that county, and the scales of\r\nrelief giving it authority were published in each of these counties\r\npreviously to the year 1800. It was apprehended by many at that time,\r\nthat either the wages of labour would rise to a height from which it\r\nwould be difficult to reduce them when the cause for it had ceased,\r\nor that during the high prices the labourers might have had to endure\r\nprivations to which it would be unsafe to expose them. To meet the\r\nemergency of the time, various schemes are said to have been adopted,\r\nsuch as weekly distributions of flour, providing families with clothes,\r\nor maintaining entirely a portion of their families, until at length\r\nthe practice became general, and a right distinctly admitted by the\r\nmagistrates was claimed by the labourer to parish relief, on the ground\r\nof inadequate wages and number in family. I was informed that the\r\nconsequences of the system were not wholly unforeseen at the time, as\r\naffording a probable inducement to early marriages and large families;\r\nbut at this period there was but little apprehension on that ground.\r\nA prevalent opinion, supported by high authority, that population was\r\nin itself a source of wealth, precluded all alarm. The demands for the\r\npublic service were thought to endure a sufficient draught for any\r\nsurplus people; and it was deemed wise by many persons at this time\r\nto present the Poor Laws to the lower classes, as an institution for\r\ntheir advantage, peculiar to this country; and to encourage an opinion\r\namong them, that by this means their own share in the property of the\r\nkingdom was recognised.’[314] To the landlords the Speenhamland system\r\nwas a safety-valve in two ways. The farmers got cheap labour, and the\r\nlabourers got a maintenance, and it was hoped thus to reconcile both\r\nclasses to high rents and the great social splendour of their rulers.\r\nThere was no encroachment on the surplus profits of agriculture, and\r\nlandlords and tithe-owners basked in the sunshine of prosperity. It\r\nwould be a mistake to represent the landlords as deliberately treating\r\nthe farmers and the labourers on the principle which Cæsar boasted\r\nthat he had applied with such success, when he borrowed money from his\r\nofficers to give it to his soldiers, and thus contrived to attach both\r\nclasses to his interest; but that was in effect the result and the\r\nsignificance of the Speenhamland system.\r\n\r\nThis wrong application of those surplus profits was one element in\r\nthe violent oscillations of trade during the generation after the\r\nwar. A long war adding enormously to the expenditure of Government\r\nmust disorganise industry seriously in any case, and in this case the\r\ndemoralisation was increased by a bad currency system. The governing\r\nclass, which was continually meditating on the subject of agricultural\r\ndistress, holding inquiries, and appointing committees, never conceived\r\nthe problem as one of distribution. The Select Committee of 1833 on\r\nAgriculture, for example, expressly disclaims any interest in the\r\nquestion of rents and wages, treating these as determined by a law\r\nof Nature, and assuming that the only question for a Government was\r\nthe question of steadying prices by protection. What they did not\r\nrealise was that a bad distribution of profits was itself a cause of\r\ndisturbance. The most instructive speech on the course of agriculture\r\nduring the French war was that in which Brougham showed in the House\r\nof Commons, on 9th April 1816, how the country had suffered from\r\nover-production during the wild elation of high prices, and how a\r\ntremendous system of speculative farming had been built up, entangling\r\na variety of interests in this gamble. If those days had been employed\r\nto raise the standard of life among the labourers and to increase their\r\npowers of consumption, the subsequent fall would have been broken.\r\nThe economists of the time looked on the millions of labourers as an\r\nitem of cost, to be regarded like the price of raw material, whereas\r\nit is clear that they ought to have been regarded also as affording\r\nthe best and most stable of markets. The landlord or the banker who\r\nput his surplus profits into the improvement and cultivation of land,\r\nonly productive under conditions that could not last and could not\r\nreturn, was increasing unemployment in the future, whereas if the same\r\nprofits had been distributed in wages among the labourers, they would\r\nhave permanently increased consumption and steadied the vicissitudes\r\nof trade. Further, employment would have been more regular in another\r\nrespect, for the landowner spent his surplus on luxuries, and the\r\nlabourer spent his wages on necessaries.\r\n\r\nNow labour might have received its share of these profits either in an\r\nincrease of wages, or in the expenditure of part of the revenue in a\r\nway that was specially beneficial to it. Wages did not rise, and it was\r\na felony to use any pressure to raise them. What was the case of the\r\npoor in regard to taxation and expenditure? Taxation was overwhelming.\r\nA Herefordshire farmer stated that in 1815 the rates and taxes on a\r\nfarm of three hundred acres in that county were:--\r\n\r\n                                                       £ _s._ _d._\r\n  Property tax, landlord and tenant                    95 16 10\r\n  Great tithes                                         64 17  6\r\n  Lesser tithes                                        29 15  0\r\n  Land tax                                             14  0  0\r\n  Window lights                                        24  1  6\r\n  Poor rates, landlord                                 10  0  0\r\n  Poor rates, tenant                                   40  0  0\r\n  Cart-horse duty, landlord, 3 horses                   2 11  0\r\n  Two saddle horses, landlord                           9  0  0\r\n  Gig                                                   6  6  0\r\n  Cart-horse duty, tenant                               7  2  0\r\n  One saddle horse, tenant                              2 13  6\r\n  Landlord’s malt duty on 60 bushels of barley         21  0  0\r\n  Tenant’s duty for making 120 bushels of barley\r\n    into malt                                          42  0  0\r\n  New rate for building shire hall, paid by landlord    9  0  0\r\n  New rate for building shire hall, paid by tenant      3  0  0\r\n  Surcharge                                             2  8  0\r\n                                                     ----------\r\n                                                     £383 11  4[315]\r\n                                                     ----------\r\n\r\nThe _Agricultural and Industrial Magazine_, a periodical published by\r\na philanthropical society in 1833, gave the following analysis of the\r\ntaxation of a labourer earning £22, 10s. a year:--\r\n\r\n                        £ _s._ _d._\r\n  1.

The great mass of the\r\nexpenditure was war expenditure, and that was not expenditure in which\r\nthe poor were more interested than the rest. Indeed, much of it was\r\nexpenditure which could not be associated directly or indirectly with\r\ntheir interests, such as the huge subsidies to the courts of Europe.\r\nNearly fifty millions went in these subventions, and if some of them\r\nwere strategical others were purely political. Did the English labourer\r\nreceive any profit from the two and a half millions that Pitt threw to\r\nthe King of Prussia, a subsidy that was employed for crushing Kosciusko\r\nand Poland, or from the millions that he gave to Austria, in return\r\nfor which Austria ceded Venice to Napoleon? Did he receive any benefit\r\nfrom the million spent every year on the German legion, which helped\r\nto keep him in order in his own country? Did he receive any benefit\r\nfrom the million and a half which, on the confession of the Finance\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons in 1810, went every year in absolute\r\nsinecures? Did he receive any benefit from the interest on the loans\r\nto the great bankers and contractors, who made huge profits out of the\r\nwar and were patriotic enough to lend money to the Government to keep\r\nit going? Did he receive any benefit from the expenditure on crimping\r\nboys or pressing seamen, or transporting and imprisoning poachers and\r\nthrowing their families by thousands on the rates? Pitt’s brilliant\r\nidea of buying up a cheap debt out of money raised by a dear one cost\r\nthe nation twenty millions, and though Pitt considered the Sinking\r\nFund his best title to honour, nobody will pretend that the poor of\r\nEngland gained anything from this display of his originality.[316]\r\nIn these years Government was raising by taxation or loans over a\r\nhundred millions, but not a single penny went to the education of\r\nthe labourer’s children, or to any purpose that made the perils and\r\ndifficulties of his life more easy to be borne. If the sinecures had\r\nbeen reduced by a half, or if the great money-lenders had been treated\r\nas if their claims to the last penny were not sacrosanct, and had been\r\nmade to take their share of the losses of the time, it would have been\r\npossible to set up the English cottager with allotments on the modest\r\nplan proposed by Young or Cobbett, side by side with the great estates\r\nwith which that expenditure endowed the bankers and the dealers in\r\nscrip.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, so long as prices kept up, the condition of the labourer was\r\nmasked by the general prosperity of the times. The governing class\r\nhad found a method which checked the demand for higher wages and the\r\ndanger that the labourer might claim a share in the bounding wealth of\r\nthe time. The wolf was at the door, it is true, but he was chained, and\r\nthe chain was the Speenhamland system. Consequently, though we hear\r\ncomplaints from the labourers, who contended that they were receiving\r\nin a patronising and degrading form what they were entitled to have\r\nas their direct wages, the note of rebellion was smothered for the\r\nmoment. At this time it was a profitable proceeding to grow corn on\r\nalmost any soil, and it is still possible to trace on the unharvested\r\ndowns of Dartmoor the print of the harrow that turned even that wild\r\nmoorland into gold, in the days when Napoleon was massing his armies\r\nfor invasion. During these years parishes did not mind giving aid from\r\nthe rates on the Speenhamland scale, and, though under this mischievous\r\nsystem population was advancing wildly, there was such a demand for\r\nlabour that this abundance did not seem, as it seemed later, a plague\r\nof locusts, but a source of strength and wealth. The opinion of the\r\nday was all in favour of a heavy birth rate, and it was generally\r\nagreed, as we have seen, that Pitt’s escapades in the West Indies and\r\nelsewhere would draw off the surplus population fast enough to remove\r\nall difficulties. But although the large farmers prayed incessantly to\r\nheaven to preserve Pitt and to keep up religion and prices, the day\r\ncame when it did not pay to plough the downs or the sands, and tumbling\r\nprices brought ruin to the farmers whose rents and whole manner of\r\nliving were fixed on the assumption that there was no serious danger\r\nof peace, and that England was to live in a perpetual heyday of famine\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nWith the fall in prices, the facts of the labourer’s condition were\r\ndisclosed. Doctors tell us that in some cases of heart disease there\r\nis a state described as compensation, which may postpone failure for\r\nmany years. With the fall in 1814 compensation ceased, and the disease\r\nwhich it obscured declared itself. For it was now no longer possible\r\nto absorb the redundant population in the wasteful roundsman system,\r\nand the maintenance standard tended to fall with the growing pressure\r\non the resources from which the labourer was kept. By this time all\r\nlabour had been swamped in the system. The ordinary village did not\r\ncontain a mass of decently paid labourers and a surplus of labourers,\r\nfrom time to time redundant, for whom the parish had to provide as best\r\nit could. It contained a mass of labourers, all of them underpaid, whom\r\nthe parish had to keep alive in the way most convenient to the farmers.\r\nBishop Berkeley once said that it was doubtful whether the prosperity\r\nthat preceded, or the calamities that succeeded, the South Sea Bubble\r\nhad been the more disastrous to Great Britain: that saying would very\r\nwell apply to the position of the agricultural labourer in regard to\r\nthe rise and the fall of prices. With the rise of prices the last\r\npatch of common agriculture had been seized by the landlords, and the\r\nlabourer had been robbed even of his garden;[317] with the fall, the\r\ngreat mass of labourers were thrown into destitution and misery. We may\r\nadd that if that prosperity had been briefer, the superstition that an\r\nartificial encouragement of population was needed--the superstition of\r\nthe rich for which the poor paid the penalty--would have had a shorter\r\nlife. As it was, at the end of the great prosperity the landlords\r\nwere enormously rich; rents had in some cases increased five-fold\r\nbetween 1790 and 1812:[318] the large farmers had in many cases climbed\r\ninto a style of life which meant a crash as soon as prices fell; the\r\nfinanciers had made great and sudden fortunes; the only class for whom\r\na rise in the standard of existence was essential to the nation, had\r\nmerely become more dependent on the pleasure of other classes and the\r\naccidents of the markets. The purchasing power of the labourer’s wages\r\nhad gone down.\r\n\r\nThe first sign of the strain is the rioting of 1816. In that year\r\nthe spirit which the governing class had tried to send to sleep by\r\nthe Speenhamland system, burst out in the first of two peasants’\r\nrevolts. Let us remember what their position was. They were not the\r\nonly people overwhelmed by the fall in prices. Some landlords, who\r\nhad been so reckless and extravagant as to live up to the enormous\r\nrevenue they were receiving, had to surrender their estates to the\r\nnew class of bankers and money-lenders that had been made powerful by\r\nthe war. Many farmers, who had taken to keeping liveried servants and\r\nto copying the pomp of their landlords, and who had staked everything\r\non the permanence of prices, were now submerged. Small farmers too,\r\nas the answers sent to the questions issued this year by the Board\r\nof Agriculture show, became paupers. The labourer was not the only\r\nsufferer. But he differed from the other victims of distress in that\r\nhe had not benefited, but, as we have seen, had lost, by the prosperity\r\nof the days when the plough turned a golden furrow. His housing had\r\nnot been improved; his dependence had not been made less abject or\r\nless absolute; his wages had not risen; and in many cases his garden\r\nhad disappeared. When the storm broke over agriculture his condition\r\nbecame desperate. In February 1816 the Board of Agriculture sent out\r\na series of questions, one of which asked for an account of the state\r\nof the poor, and out of 273 replies 237 reported want of employment\r\nand distress, and 25 reported that there was not unemployment or\r\ndistress.[319] One of the correspondents explained that in his district\r\nthe overseer called a meeting every Saturday, when he put up each\r\nlabourer by name to auction, and they were let generally at from\r\n1s. 6d. to 2s. per week and their provisions, their families being\r\nsupported by the parish.[320]\r\n\r\nIn 1816 the labourers were suffering both from unemployment and\r\nfrom high prices. In 1815, as the _Annual Register_[321] puts it,\r\n‘much distress was undergone in the latter part of the year by the\r\ntrading portion of the community. This source of private calamity was\r\nunfortunately coincident with an extraordinary decline in agricultural\r\nprosperity, immediately proceeding from the greatly reduced price of\r\ncorn and other products, which bore no adequate proportion to the\r\nexorbitant rents and other heavy burdens pressing upon the farmer.’\r\nAt the beginning of 1816 there were gloomy anticipations of a fall in\r\nprices, and Western[322] moved a series of resolutions designed to\r\nprevent the importation of corn. But as the year advanced it became\r\nevident that the danger that threatened England was not the danger\r\nof abundance but the danger of scarcity. A bitterly cold summer was\r\nfollowed by so meagre a harvest that the price of corn rose rapidly\r\nbeyond the point at which the ports were open for importation. But high\r\nprices which brought bidders at once for farms that had been unlet made\r\nbread and meat dear to the agricultural labourer, without bringing him\r\nmore employment or an advance of wages, and the riots of 1816 were the\r\nresult of the misery due to this combination of misfortunes.\r\n\r\nThe riots broke out in May of that year, and the counties affected\r\nwere Norfolk, Suffolk, Huntingdon and Cambridgeshire. Nightly\r\nassemblies were held, threatening letters were sent, and houses, barns\r\nand ricks were set on fire. These fires were a prelude to a more\r\ndetermined agitation, which had such an effect on the authorities that\r\nthe Sheriff of Suffolk and Mr. Willet, a banker of Brandon near Bury,\r\nhastened to London to inform the Home Secretary and to ask for the\r\nhelp of the Government in restoring tranquillity. Mr. Willet’s special\r\ninterest in the proceedings is explained in a naïve sentence in the\r\n_Annual Register_: ‘A reduction in the price of bread and meat was the\r\navowed object of the rioters. They had fixed a maximum for the price of\r\nboth. They insisted that the lowest price of wheat must be half a crown\r\na bushel, and that of prime joints of beef fourpence per pound. Mr.\r\nWillet, a butcher at Brandon, was a marked object of their ill-will,\r\nin which Mr. Willet, the banker, was, from the similarity of his name,\r\nin danger of sharing. This circumstance, and a laudable anxiety to\r\npreserve the public peace, induced him to take an active part and exert\r\nall his influence for that purpose.’[323] The rioters numbered some\r\nfifteen hundred, and they broke up into separate parties, scattering\r\ninto different towns and villages. In the course of their depredations\r\nthe house of the right Mr. Willet was levelled to the ground, after\r\nwhich the wrong Mr. Willet, it is to be hoped, was less restless.[324]\r\n‘They were armed with long, heavy sticks, the ends of which, to the\r\nextent of several inches, were studded with short iron spikes, sharp at\r\nthe sides and point. Their flag was inscribed “_Bread or Blood!_” and\r\nthey threatened to march to London.’[325]\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days there were encounters between insurgent mobs\r\nin Norwich and Bury and the yeomanry, the dragoons, and the West\r\nNorfolk Militia. No lives seem to have been lost, but a good deal\r\nof property was destroyed, and a number of rioters were taken into\r\ncustody. The _Times_ of 25th May says, in an article on these riots,\r\nthat wages had been reduced to a rate lower than the magistrates\r\nthought reasonable, for the magistrates, after suppressing a riot near\r\nDownham, acquiesced in the propriety of raising wages, and released the\r\noffenders who had been arrested with a suitable remonstrance. There was\r\na much more serious battle at Littleport in the Isle of Ely, when the\r\nold fighting spirit of the fens seems to have inspired the rioters.\r\nThey began by driving from his house a clergyman magistrate of the name\r\nof Vachel, after which they attacked several houses and extorted money.\r\nThey then made for Ely, where they carried out the same programme.\r\nThis state of anarchy, after two or three days, ended in a battle in\r\nLittleport in which two rioters were killed, and seventy-five taken\r\nprisoners. The prisoners were tried next month by a Special Commission:\r\ntwenty-four were capitally convicted; of these five were hung, five\r\nwere transported for life, one was transported for fourteen years,\r\nthree for seven years, and ten were imprisoned for twelve months in\r\nEly gaol.[326] The spirit in which one of the judges, Mr. Christian,\r\nthe Chief Justice of the Isle of Ely, conducted the proceedings may be\r\ngathered from his closing speech, in which he said that the rioters\r\nwere receiving ‘great wages’ and that ‘any change in the price of\r\nprovisions could only lessen that superfluity, which, I fear, they too\r\nfrequently wasted in drunkenness.’[327]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the changed conditions of the nation on this system\r\nof maintenance out of the rates is seen, not only in the behaviour of\r\nthe labourers, but also in the growing anxiety of the upper classes\r\nto control the system, and in the tenacity with which the parishes\r\ncontested settlement claims. This is the great period of Poor Law\r\nlitigation. Parish authorities kept a stricter watch than ever on\r\nimmigrants. In 1816, for example, the Board of Agriculture reported\r\nthat according to a correspondent ‘a late legal decision, determining\r\nthat keeping a cow gained a settlement, has deprived many cottagers\r\nof that comfort, as it is properly called.’[328] This decision was\r\nremedied by the 1819 Act[329] to amend the Settlement Laws as regards\r\nrenting tenements, and the Report on the Poor Law in 1819 states\r\nthat in consequence there ‘will no longer be an obstacle to the\r\naccommodation which may be afforded in some instances to a poor family,\r\nby renting the pasturage of a cow, or some other temporary profit from\r\nthe occupation of land.’[330] Lawsuits between parishes were incessant,\r\nand in 1815 the money spent on litigation and the removal of paupers\r\nreached the gigantic figure of £287,000.\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, too, the question of Poor Law Reform was seen to be\r\nurgent, but the problem assumed a particular and very limited shape.\r\nThe significance of this development can be illustrated by comparing\r\nthe character and the fate of a measure Whitbread had introduced in\r\n1807 with the character and the fate of the legislation after Waterloo.\r\n\r\nWhitbread’s scheme had aimed at (1) improving and humanising the Law of\r\nSettlement; (2) reforming the administration of the Poor Law as such\r\nin such a way as to give greater encouragement to economy and a fairer\r\ndistribution of burdens; (3) stimulating thrift and penalising idleness\r\nin the labourers; (4) reforming unemployment policy.\r\n\r\nThe proposals under the first head provided that settlement might be\r\ngained by five years’ residence as a householder, if the householder\r\nhad not become chargeable or been convicted of crime, or been absent\r\nfor more than six weeks in a year. Two Justices of the Peace were to\r\nhave power on complaint of the parish authorities to adjudicate on the\r\nsettlement of any person likely to become chargeable, subject to an\r\nappeal to Quarter Sessions.\r\n\r\nThe proposals under the second head aimed partly at vestry reform\r\nand partly at rating reform. In those parishes where there was an\r\nopen vestry, all ratepayers were still equal as voters, but Whitbread\r\nproposed to give extra voting power at vestry meetings in proportion\r\nto assessment.[331] He wished to reform rating, by making stock in\r\ntrade and personal property (except farming stock), which produced\r\nprofit liable to assessment, by authorising the vestry to exempt such\r\noccupiers of cottages as they should think fit, and by giving power\r\nto the Justices of the Peace to strike out of the rate any person\r\noccupying a cottage not exceeding five pounds in yearly value, who\r\nshould make application to them, such exemptions not to be considered\r\nparochial relief. He also proposed that the county rate should be\r\ncharged in every parish in proportion to the assessed property in the\r\nparish, and that any parish whose poor rate was for three years more\r\nthan double the average of the parish rate in the county, should have\r\npower to apply to Quarter Sessions for relief out of county stock.\r\n\r\nWhitbread’s proposals for stimulating thrift and penalising idleness\r\nwere a strange medley of enlightenment and childishness. He proposed\r\nto give the parish officers power to build cottages which were to be\r\nlet at the best rents that were to be obtained: but the parish officers\r\nmight with the consent of the vestry allow persons who could not pay\r\nrent to occupy them rent free, or at a reduced rent. He proposed also\r\nto create a National Bank, something of the nature of a Post Office\r\nSavings Bank, to be employed both as a savings bank and an insurance\r\nsystem for the poor. With these two excellent schemes he combined a\r\nridiculous system of prizes and punishments for the thrifty and the\r\nirresponsible. Magistrates were to be empowered to give rewards (up to\r\na maximum of £20) with a badge of good conduct, to labourers who had\r\nbrought up large families without parish help, and to punish any man\r\nwho appeared to have become chargeable from idleness or misconduct, and\r\nto brand him with the words, ‘criminal Poor.’\r\n\r\nIn his unemployment policy Whitbread committed the fatal mistake,\r\ncommon to almost all the proposals of the time, of mixing up poor\r\nrelief with wages in a way to depress and demoralise the labour market.\r\nThe able-bodied unemployed, men, youths, or single women, were to be\r\nhired out by parish officers at the best price to be obtained. The\r\nwages were to be paid to the worker. If the worker was a single man\r\nor woman, or a widower with no children dependent on him, his or her\r\nearnings were to be made up by the parish to a sum necessary to his or\r\nher subsistence. If he or she had children, they were to be made up to\r\nthree-quarters, or four-fifths, or the full average rate, according to\r\nthe number of children. No single man or woman was to be hired out for\r\nmore than a year, and no man or woman with dependent children for more\r\nthan a month.\r\n\r\nThe proposals were attacked vigorously by two critics who were not\r\noften found in company, Cobbett and Malthus. Cobbett criticised the\r\nintroduction of plural voting at vestry meetings in an excellent\r\npassage in the _Political Register_.[332] ‘Many of those who pay rates\r\nare but a step or two from pauperism themselves; and they are the most\r\nlikely persons to consider duly the important duty of doing, in case of\r\nrelief, what they would be done unto. “But,” Mr. Whitbread will say,\r\n“is it right for these persons to _give away the money of others_.” It\r\nis _not_ the money of others, any more than the amount of tithes is\r\nthe farmer’s money. The maintenance of the poor is a charge upon the\r\nland, a charge duly considered in every purchase and in every lease.\r\nBesides, as the law now stands, though every parishioner has a vote\r\nin vestry, must it not be evident, to every man who reflects, that a\r\nman of large property and superior understanding will have weight in\r\nproportion? That he will, in fact, have _many votes_? If he play the\r\ntyrant, even little men will rise against him, and it is right they\r\nshould have the power of so doing; but, while he conducts himself with\r\nmoderation and humanity, while he behaves as he ought to do to those\r\nwho are beneath him in point of property, there is no fear but he will\r\nhave a sufficiency of weight at every vestry. The votes of the inferior\r\npersons in the parish are, in reality, dormant, unless in cases where\r\nsome innovation, or some act of tyranny, is attempted. They are, like\r\nthe sting of the bee, weapons merely of defence.’\r\n\r\nMalthus’ criticisms were of a very different nature.[333] He objected\r\nparticularly to the public building of cottages, and the assessment of\r\npersonal property to the rates. He argued that the scarcity of houses\r\nwas the chief reason ‘why the Poor Laws had not been so extensive\r\nand prejudicial in their effects as might have been expected.’ If a\r\nstimulus was given to the building of cottages there would be no check\r\non the increase of population. A similar tendency he ascribed to the\r\nrating of personal property. The employers of labour had an interest\r\nin the increase of population, and therefore in the building of\r\ncottages. This instinct was at present held in check by consideration\r\nof the burden of the rates. If, however, they could distribute that\r\nburden more widely, this consideration would have much less weight.\r\nPopulation would increase and wages would consequently go down. ‘It\r\nhas been observed by Dr. Adam Smith that no efforts of the legislature\r\nhad been able to raise the salary of curates to that price which\r\nseemed necessary for their decent maintenance: and the reason which\r\nhe justly assigns is that the bounties held out to the profession by\r\nthe scholarships and fellowships of the universities always occasioned\r\na redundant supply. In the same manner, if a more than usual supply\r\nof labour were encouraged by the premiums of small tenements, nothing\r\ncould prevent a great and general fall in its price.’\r\n\r\nThe Bill was introduced in 1807, before the fall of the Whig Ministry,\r\nand it went to a Committee. But the Tory Parliament elected that year\r\nto support Portland and his anti-Catholic Government was unfriendly,\r\nand the county magistrates to whom the draft of the Bill was sent\r\nfor criticisms were also hostile. Whitbread accordingly proceeded no\r\nfurther. At this time the Speenhamland system seemed to be working\r\nwithout serious inconvenience, and there was therefore no driving power\r\nbehind such proposals. But after 1815 the conditions had changed, and\r\nthe apathy of 1807 had melted away. The ruling class was no longer\r\npassive and indifferent about the growth of the Speenhamland system:\r\nboth Houses of Parliament set inquiries on foot, schemes of emigration\r\nwere invited and discussed, and measures of Vestry Reform were carried.\r\nBut the problem was no longer the problem that Whitbread had set out\r\nto solve. Whitbread had proposed to increase the share of property\r\nin the control of the poor rates, but he had also brought forward a\r\nconstructive scheme of social improvement. The Vestry Reformers of\r\nthis period were merely interested in reducing the rates; the rest of\r\nWhitbread’s programme was forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 an Act[334] was passed which established plural voting in\r\nvestries, every ratepayer whose rateable value was £50 and over being\r\nallowed a vote for every £25 of rateable property. In the following\r\nyear an Act[335] was passed which allowed parishes to set up a select\r\nvestry, and ordained that in these parishes the overseers should\r\ngive such relief as was ordered by the Select Vestry, and further\r\nallowed the appointment of salaried assistant overseers. These\r\nchanges affected the administration of the Speenhamland system very\r\nconsiderably: and the salaried overseers made themselves hated in many\r\nparishes by the Draconian regime which they introduced. The parish\r\ncart, or the cart to which in some parishes men and women who asked\r\nfor relief were harnessed, was one of the innovations of this period.\r\nThe administrative methods that were adopted in these parishes are\r\nillustrated by a fact mentioned by a clerk to the magistrates in Kent,\r\nin October 1880.[336] The writer says that there was a severe overseer\r\nat Ash, who had among other applicants for relief an unemployed\r\nshepherd, with a wife and five children living at Margate, thirteen\r\nmiles away. The shepherd was given 9s. a week, but the overseer\r\nmade him walk to Ash every day except Sunday for his eighteenpence.\r\nThe shepherd walked his twenty-six miles a day on such food as he\r\ncould obtain out of his share of the 9s. for nine weeks, and then\r\nhis strength could hold out no longer. The writer remarked that the\r\nshepherd was an industrious and honest man, out of work through no\r\nfault of his own. It was by such methods that the salaried overseers\r\ntried to break the poor of the habit of asking for relief, and it\r\nis not surprising that such methods rankled in the memories of the\r\nlabourers. In this neighbourhood the writer attributed the fires of\r\n1830 more to this cause than to any other.\r\n\r\nThese attempts to relieve the ratepayer did nothing to relieve the\r\nlabourer from the incubus of the system. His plight grew steadily\r\nworse. A Committee on Agricultural Wages, of which Lord John Russell\r\nwas chairman, reported in 1824 that whereas in certain northern\r\ncounties, where the Speenhamland system had not yet taken root, wages\r\nwere 12s. to 15s., in the south they varied from 8s. or 9s. a week to\r\n3s. for a single man and 4s. 6d. for a married man.[337] In one part of\r\nKent the lowest wages in one parish were 6d. a day, and in the majority\r\nof parishes 1s. a day. The wages of an unmarried man in Buckinghamshire\r\nin 1828, according to a clergyman who gave evidence before the\r\nCommittee of that year on the Poor Laws, were 3s. a week, and the wages\r\nof a married man were 6s. a week. In one parish in his neighbourhood\r\nthe farmers had lately reduced the wages of able-bodied married men to\r\n4s. a week. Thus the Speenhamland system had been effective enough in\r\nkeeping wages low, but as a means of preserving a minimum livelihood\r\nit was breaking down by this time on all sides. We have seen from the\r\nhistory of Merton in Oxfordshire[338] what happened in one parish long\r\nbefore the adversities of agriculture had become acute. It is easy from\r\nthis case to imagine what happened when the decline in employment\r\nand agriculture threw a steadily increasing burden on the system of\r\nmaintenance from the rates. In some places, as the Commissioners of\r\n1834 reported, the labourers were able by intimidation to keep the\r\nsystem in force, but though parishes did not as a rule dare to abandon\r\nor reform the system, they steadily reduced their scale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most direct and graphic demonstration of this fact, which has not\r\napparently ever been noticed in any of the voluminous discussions\r\nof the old Poor Law system, is to be seen in the comparison of the\r\nstandards of life adopted at the time the system was introduced with\r\nthe standards that were adopted later. In 1795, as we have seen, the\r\nmagistrates at Speenhamland recommended an allowance of three gallon\r\nloaves for each labourer, and a gallon loaf and a half for his wife\r\nand for each additional member of his family. This scale, it must be\r\nremembered, was not peculiar to Berkshire. It was the authoritative\r\nstandard in many counties. We are able to compare this with some\r\nlater scales, and the comparison yields some startling results. In\r\nNorthamptonshire in 1816 the magistrates fixed a single man’s allowance\r\nat 5s., and the allowance for a man and his wife at 6s., the price\r\nof wheat the quartern loaf being 11-1/2d.[339] On this scale a man\r\nis supposed to need a little over two and a half gallon loaves, and\r\na man and his wife a little more than three gallon loaves, or barely\r\nmore than a single man was supposed to need in 1795. This is a grave\r\nreduction, but the maintenance standard fell very much lower before\r\n1832. For though we have scales for Cambridgeshire and Essex for 1821\r\npublished in the Report of the Poor Law Commission of 1834,[340] which\r\nagree roughly with the Northamptonshire scale (two gallon loaves for a\r\nman, and one and a half for a woman), in Wiltshire, according to the\r\ncomplicated scale adopted at Hindon in 1817, a man was allowed one\r\nand three-fifths gallon loaves, and a woman one and one-tenth.[341] A\r\nHampshire scale, drawn up in 1822 by eight magistrates, of whom five\r\nwere parsons, allowed only one gallon loaf a head, with 4d. a week\r\nper head in addition to a family of four persons, the extra allowance\r\nbeing reduced by a penny in cases where there were six in the family,\r\nand by twopence in cases where there were more than six.[342] The\r\nDorsetshire magistrates in 1826 allowed a man the equivalent of one\r\nand a half gallon loaves and a penny over, and a woman or child over\r\nfourteen one and one-sixth.[343] We have a general statement as to\r\nthe scales in force towards the end of our period in a passage in\r\nM‘Culloch’s _Political Economy_ quoted in the _Edinburgh Review_ for\r\nJanuary 1831 (p. 353): ‘The allowance scales now issued from time to\r\ntime by the magistrates are usually framed on the principle that every\r\nlabourer should have a gallon loaf of standard wheaten bread weekly for\r\nevery member of his family and one over: that is four loaves for three\r\npersons, five for four, six for five, and so on.’ That is, a family of\r\nfour persons would have had seven and a half gallon loaves in 1795, and\r\nonly five gallon loaves in 1831.\r\n\r\nNow the Speenhamland scale did not represent some easy and luxurious\r\nstandard of living; it represented the minimum on which it was supposed\r\nthat a man employed in agriculture could support life. In thirty-five\r\nyears the standard had dropped, according to M‘Culloch’s statement, as\r\nmuch as a third, and this not because of war or famine, for in 1826\r\nEngland had had eleven years of peace, but in the ordinary course of\r\nthe life of the nation. Is such a decline in the standard of life\r\nrecorded anywhere else in history?\r\n\r\nHow did the labourers live at all under these conditions? Their life\r\nwas, of course, wretched and squalid in the extreme. Cobbett describes\r\na group of women labourers whom he met by the roadside in Hampshire\r\nas ‘such an assemblage of rags as I never saw before even amongst the\r\nhoppers at Farnham.’ Of the labourers near Cricklade he said: ‘Their\r\ndwellings are little better than pig-beds, and their looks indicate\r\nthat their food is not nearly equal to that of a pig. These wretched\r\nhovels are stuck upon little beds of ground on the _roadside_ where\r\nthe space has been wider than the road demanded. In many places they\r\nhave not two rods to a hovel. It seems as if they had been swept off\r\nthe fields by a hurricane, and had dropped and found shelter under\r\nthe banks on the roadside. Yesterday morning was a sharp frost, and\r\nthis had set the poor creatures to digging up their little plots of\r\npotatoes. In my whole life I never saw human wretchedness equal\r\nto this; no, not even amongst the free negroes in America who, on\r\nan average, do not work one day out of four.’[344] The labourers’\r\ncottages in Leicestershire he found were ‘hovels made of mud and\r\nstraw, bits of glass or of old cast-off windows, without frames or\r\nhinges frequently, and merely stuck in the mud wall. Enter them and\r\nlook at the bits of chairs or stools, the wretched boards tacked\r\ntogether to serve for a table, the floor of pebble broken or of the\r\nbare ground; look at the thing called a bed, and survey the rags on\r\nthe backs of the inhabitants.’[345] A Dorsetshire clergyman, a witness\r\nbefore the Committee on Wages in 1824, said that the labourers lived\r\nalmost entirely on tea and potatoes; a Bedfordshire labourer said that\r\nhe and his family lived mainly on bread and cheese and water, and\r\nthat sometimes for a month together he never tasted meat; a Suffolk\r\nmagistrate described how a labourer out of work, convicted of stealing\r\nwood, begged to be sent at once to a House of Correction, where he\r\nhoped to find food and employment. If Davies had written an account\r\nof the labouring classes in 1820 or 1830, the picture he drew in 1795\r\nwould have seemed bright in comparison. But even this kind of life\r\ncould not be supported on such provision as was made by the parish.\r\nHow, then, did the labourers maintain any kind of existence when\r\nsociety ceased to piece together a minimum livelihood out of rates and\r\nwages?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the answer to this question we must turn to the history of crime\r\nand punishment; to the Reports of the Parliamentary Committees\r\non Labourers’ Wages (1824), on the Game Laws (1823 and 1828), on\r\nEmigration (1826 and 1827), on Criminal Commitments and Convictions and\r\nSecondary Punishments (1827, 1828, 1831, and 1832), and the evidence\r\nof those who were in touch with this side of village life. From these\r\nsources we learn that, rate aid not being sufficient to bring wages to\r\nthe maintenance level, poaching, smuggling, and ultimately thieving\r\nwere called in to rehabilitate the labourer’s economic position.[346]\r\nHe was driven to the wages of crime. The history of the agricultural\r\nlabourer in this generation is written in the code of the Game Laws,\r\nthe growing brutality of the Criminal Law, and the preoccupation of\r\nthe rich with the efficacy of punishment.\r\n\r\nWe know from Fielding with what sort of justice the magistrates treated\r\npersons accused of poaching in the reign of George III.’s grandfather,\r\nbut when he wrote his account of Squire Western, and when Blackstone\r\nwrote that the Game Laws had raised up a little Nimrod in every manor,\r\nthe blood of men and boys had not yet been spilt for the pleasures of\r\nthe rich. It is only after Fielding and Blackstone were both in their\r\ngraves that this page of history became crimson, and that the gentlemen\r\nof England took to guarding their special amusements by methods of\r\nwhich a Member of Parliament declared that the nobles of France had not\r\nventured on their like in the days of their most splendid arrogance.\r\nThe little Nimrods who made and applied their code were a small and\r\nselect class. They were the persons qualified under the law of Charles\r\nII. to shoot game, _i.e._ persons who possessed a freehold estate of at\r\nleast £100 a year, or a leasehold estate of at least £150 a year, or\r\nthe son or heir-apparent of an esquire or person of higher degree. The\r\nlegislation that occupies so much of English history during a period\r\nof misery and famine is devoted to the protection of the monopoly of\r\nthis class, comprising less than one in ten thousand of the people of\r\nEngland. A Member of Parliament named Warburton said in the House of\r\nCommons that the only parallel to this monopoly was to be found in\r\nMariner’s account of the Tonga Islands, where rats were preserved as\r\ngame. Anybody might eat rats there, but nobody was allowed to kill them\r\nexcept persons descended from gods or kings.\r\n\r\nWith the general growth of upper-class riches and luxury there came\r\nover shooting a change corresponding with the change that turned\r\nhunting into a magnificent and extravagant spectacle. The habit set\r\nin of preserving game in great masses, of organising the battue, of\r\nmaintaining armies of keepers. In many parts of the country, pheasants\r\nwere now introduced for the first time. Whereas game had hitherto\r\nkept something of the wildness, and vagrancy, and careless freedom of\r\nNature, the woods were now packed with tame and docile birds, whose gay\r\nfeathers sparkled among the trees, before the eyes of the half-starved\r\nlabourers breaking stones on the road at half a crown a week. The\r\nchange is described by witnesses such as Sir James Graham and Sir\r\nThomas Baring, magistrates respectively in Cumberland and Hampshire,\r\nbefore the Select Committee on Criminal Commitments and Convictions\r\nin 1827. England was, in fact, passing through a process precisely\r\nopposite to that which had taken place in France: the sport of the rich\r\nwas becoming more and more of an elaborate system, and more of a vested\r\ninterest. This development was marked by the growth of an offensive\r\ncombination among game preservers; in some parts of the country game\r\nassociations were formed, for the express purpose of paying the costs\r\nof prosecutions, so that the poacher had against him not merely a bench\r\nof game preservers, but a ring of squires, a sort of Holy Alliance for\r\nthe punishment of social rebels, which drew its meshes not round a\r\nparish but round a county. Simultaneously, as we have seen, a general\r\nchange was coming over the circumstances and position of the poor. The\r\nmass of the people were losing their rights and independence; they were\r\nbeing forced into an absolute dependence on wages, and were living on\r\nthe brink of famine. These two developments must be kept in mind in\r\nwatching the building up of the game code in the last phase of the\r\nancient régime.\r\n\r\nThe Acts for protecting game passed after the accession of George III.\r\nare in a crescendo of fierceness. The first important Act was passed\r\nIn 1770. Under this Act any one who killed game of any kind between\r\nsunsetting and sunrising, or used any gun, or dog, snare, net, or other\r\nengine for destroying game at night, was, on conviction by one witness\r\nbefore one Justice of the Peace, to be punished with imprisonment for\r\nnot less than three months or more than six. For a subsequent offence\r\nhe was to be imprisoned for not more than twelve months or less than\r\nsix, and to be whipped publicly between the hours of twelve and one\r\no’clock. This was light punishment compared with the measures that were\r\nto follow. In the year 1800, the year of Marengo, when all England\r\nwas braced up for its great duel with the common enemy of freedom and\r\norder, and the labourers were told every day that they would be the\r\nfirst to suffer if Napoleon landed in England, the English Parliament\r\nfound time to pass another Act to punish poachers, and to teach justice\r\nto mend her slow pace. By this Act when two or more persons were found\r\nin any forest, chase, park, wood, plantation, paddock, field, meadow,\r\nor other open or enclosed ground, having any gun, net, engine, or other\r\ninstrument, with the intent to destroy, take, or kill game, they were\r\nto be seized by keepers or servants, and on conviction before a J.P.,\r\nthey were to be treated as rogues and vagabonds under the Act of 1744,\r\n_i.e._ they were to be punished by imprisonment with hard labour; an\r\nincorrigible rogue, _i.e._ a second offender, was to be imprisoned for\r\ntwo years with whipping. Further, if the offender was over twelve years\r\nof age, the magistrates might sentence him to serve in the army or\r\nnavy. If an incorrigible rogue escaped from the House of Correction he\r\nwas to be liable to transportation for seven years.\r\n\r\nTwo consequences followed from this Act. Now that punishment was made\r\nso severe, the poacher had a strong reason for violence: surrender\r\nmeant service in a condemned regiment, and he therefore took the risks\r\nof resistance. The second consequence was the practice of poaching in\r\nlarge groups. The organisation of poaching gangs was not a natural\r\ndevelopment of the industry; it was adopted in self-defence.[347] This\r\nAct led inevitably to those battles between gamekeepers and labourers\r\nthat became so conspicuous a feature of English life at this time, and\r\nin 1803 Lord Ellenborough passed an Act which provided that any persons\r\nwho presented a gun or tried to stab or cut ‘with intent to obstruct,\r\nresist, or prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of the person or\r\npersons so stabbing or cutting, or the lawful apprehension or detainer\r\nof any of his, her, or their accomplices for any offences for which\r\nhe, she, or they may respectively be liable by law to be apprehended,\r\nimprisoned, or detained,’ should suffer death as a felon. In 1816, when\r\npeace and the fall of prices were bringing new problems in their train,\r\nthere went through Parliament, without a syllable of debate, a Bill of\r\nwhich Romilly said that no parallel to it could be found in the laws of\r\nany country in the world. By that Act a person who was found at night\r\nunarmed, but with a net for poaching, in any forest, chase, or park\r\nwas to be punished by transportation for seven years. This Act Romilly\r\ninduced Parliament to repeal in the following year, but the Act that\r\ntook its place only softened the law to the extent of withdrawing this\r\npunishment from persons found with nets, but without guns or bludgeons:\r\nit enacted that any person so found, armed with gun, crossbow,\r\nfirearms, bludgeon, or any other offensive weapon, was to be tried at\r\nQuarter Sessions, and if convicted, to be sentenced to transportation\r\nfor seven years: if such offender were to return to Great Britain\r\nbefore his time was over, he was to be transported for the rest of his\r\nlife.[348]\r\n\r\nThis savage Act, though by no means a dead letter, as Parliamentary\r\nReturns show, seems to have defeated its own end, for in 1828 it was\r\nrepealed, because, as Lord Wharncliffe told the House of Lords, there\r\nwas a certain reluctance on the part of juries to convict a prisoner,\r\nwhen they knew that conviction would be followed by transportation.\r\nThe new Act of 1828, which allowed a person to be convicted before two\r\nmagistrates, reserved transportation for the third offence, punishing\r\nthe first offence by three months’, and the second by six months’\r\nimprisonment. But the convicted person had to find sureties after his\r\nrelease, or else go back to hard labour for another six months if it\r\nwas a first offence, or another twelve months if it was his second.\r\nFurther, if three men were found in a wood and one of them carried a\r\ngun or bludgeon, all three were liable to be transported for fourteen\r\nyears.[349] Althorp’s Bill of 1831 which abolished the qualifications\r\nof the Act of Charles II., gave the right to shoot to every landowner\r\nwho took out a certificate, and made the sale of game legal, proposed\r\nin its original form to alter these punishments, making that for the\r\nfirst and second offences rather more severe (four and eight months),\r\nand that for the third, two years’ imprisonment. In Committee in the\r\nHouse of Commons the two years were reduced to one year on the proposal\r\nof Orator Hunt. The House of Lords, however, restored the punishments\r\nof the Act of 1828.\r\n\r\nThese were the main Acts for punishing poachers that were passed\r\nduring the last phase of the ancient régime. How large a part they\r\nplayed in English life may be imagined from a fact mentioned by the\r\nDuke of Richmond in 1831.[350] In the three years between 1827 and\r\n1830 one in seven of all the criminal convictions in the country were\r\nconvictions under the Game Code. The number of persons so convicted\r\nwas 8502, many of them being under eighteen. Some of them had been\r\ntransported for life, and some for seven or fourteen years. In some\r\nyears the proportion was still higher.[351] We must remember, too, what\r\nkind of judges had tried many of these men and boys. ‘There is not a\r\nworse-constituted tribunal on the face of the earth,’ said Brougham\r\nin 1828, ‘not even that of the Turkish Cadi, than that at which\r\nsummary convictions on the Game Laws constantly take place; I mean\r\na bench or a brace of sporting justices. I am far from saying that,\r\non such subjects, they are actuated by corrupt motives; but they are\r\nundoubtedly instigated by their abhorrence of that _caput lupinum_,\r\nthat _hostis humani generis_, as an Honourable Friend of mine once\r\ncalled him in his place, that _fera naturæ_--a poacher. From their\r\ndecisions on those points, where their passions are the most likely to\r\nmislead them, no appeal in reality lies to a more calm and unprejudiced\r\ntribunal; for, unless they set out any matter illegal on the face of\r\nthe conviction, you remove the record in vain.’[352]\r\n\r\nThe close relation of this great increase of crime to the general\r\ndistress was universally recognised. Cobbett tells us that a gentleman\r\nin Surrey asked a young man, who was cracking stones on the roadside,\r\nhow he could live upon half a crown a week. ‘I don’t live upon it,’\r\nsaid he. ‘How do you live then?’ ‘Why,’ said he, ‘I _poach_: it is\r\nbetter to be hanged than to be starved to death.’[353] This story\r\nreceives illustration after illustration in the evidence taken by\r\nParliamentary Committees. The visiting Justices of the Prisons in\r\nBedfordshire reported in 1827 that the great increase in commitments,\r\nand particularly the number of commitments for offences against the\r\nGame Laws, called for an inquiry. More than a third of the commitments\r\nduring the last quarter had been for such offences. The Report\r\ncontinues:--\r\n\r\n‘In many parishes in this county the wages given to young unmarried\r\nagricultural labourers, in the full strength and vigour of life, seldom\r\nexceed 3s. or 3s. 6d. a week, paid to them, generally, under the\r\ndescription of roundsmen, by the overseers out of the poor rates; and\r\noften in the immediate vicinity of the dwellings of such half-starved\r\nlabourers there are abundantly-stocked preserves of game, in which,\r\nduring a single night, these dissatisfied young men can obtain a rich\r\nbooty by snaring hares and taking or killing pheasants ... offences\r\nwhich they cannot be brought to acknowledge to be any violation of\r\nprivate property. Detection generally leads to their imprisonment, and\r\nimprisonment introduces these youths to familiarity with criminals of\r\nother descriptions, and thus they become rapidly abandoned to unlawful\r\npursuits and a life of crime.’[354] Mr. Orridge, Governor of the\r\nGaol of Bury St. Edmunds, gave to the Committee on Commitments and\r\nConvictions[355] the following figures of prisoners committed to the\r\nHouse of Correction for certain years:--\r\n\r\n  1805, 221   1815, 387   1824, 457\r\n  1806, 192   1816, 476   1825, 439\r\n  1807, 173   1817, 430   1826, 573.\r\n\r\nHe stated that the great increase in the number of commitments began\r\nin the year 1815 with the depression of agriculture and the great\r\ndearth of employment: that men were employed on the roads at very low\r\nrates: that the commitments under the Game Laws which in 1810 were\r\nfive, in 1811 four, and in 1812 two, were seventy-five in 1822, a year\r\nof great agricultural distress, sixty in 1823, sixty-one in 1824, and\r\nseventy-one in 1825. Some men were poachers from the love of sport, but\r\nthe majority from distress. Mr. Pym, a magistrate in Cambridgeshire,\r\nand Sir Thomas Baring, a magistrate for Hampshire, gave similar\r\nevidence as to the cause of the increase of crime, and particularly of\r\npoaching, in these counties. Mr. Bishop, a Bow Street officer, whose\r\nbusiness it was to mix with the poachers in public-houses and learn\r\ntheir secrets, told the Committee on the Game Laws in 1823 that there\r\nhad not been employment for the labouring poor in most of the places\r\nhe had visited. Perhaps the most graphic picture of the relation of\r\ndistress to crime is given in a pamphlet, _Thoughts and Suggestions on\r\nthe Present Condition of the Country_, published in 1830 by Mr. Potter\r\nMacqueen, late M.P. for Bedford.\r\n\r\n‘In January 1829, there were ninety-six prisoners for trial in Bedford\r\nGaol, of whom seventy-six were able-bodied men, in the prime of life,\r\nand, chiefly, of general good character, who were driven to crime by\r\nsheer want, and who would have been valuable subjects had they been\r\nplaced in a situation, where, by the exercise of their health and\r\nstrength, they could have earned a subsistence. There were in this\r\nnumber eighteen poachers, awaiting trial for the capital offence of\r\nusing arms in self-defence when attacked by game-keepers; of these\r\neighteen men, one only was not a parish pauper, and he was the agent\r\nof the London poulterers, who, passing under the apparent vocation of\r\na rat-catcher, paid these poor creatures more in one night than they\r\ncould obtain from the overseer for a week’s labour. I conversed with\r\neach of these men singly, and made minutes of their mode of life. The\r\ntwo first I will mention are the two brothers, the Lilleys, in custody\r\nunder a charge of firing on and wounding a keeper, who endeavoured to\r\napprehend them whilst poaching. They were two remarkably fine young\r\nmen, and very respectably connected. The elder, twenty-eight years\r\nof age, married, with two small children. When I inquired how he\r\ncould lend himself to such a wretched course of life, the poor fellow\r\nreplied: ‘Sir, I had a pregnant wife, with one infant at her knee, and\r\nanother at her breast; I was anxious to obtain work, I offered myself\r\nin all directions, but without success; if I went to a distance, I was\r\ntold to go back to my parish, and when I did so, I was allowed ...\r\nWhat? Why, for myself, my babes, and my wife, in a condition requiring\r\nmore than common support, and unable to labour, I was allowed 7s. a\r\nweek for all; for which I was expected to work on the roads from light\r\nto dark, and to pay three guineas a year for the hovel which sheltered\r\nus.’ The other brother, aged twenty-two, unmarried, received 6d. a day.\r\nThese men were hanged at the spring assizes. Of the others, ten were\r\nsingle men, their ages varying from seventeen to twenty-seven. Many had\r\nnever been in gaol before, and were considered of good character. Six\r\nof them were on the roads at 6d. per day. Two could not obtain even\r\nthis pittance. One had been refused relief on the ground that he had\r\nshortly previous obtained a profitable piece of job-work, and one had\r\nexisted on 1s. 6d. during the fortnight before he joined the gang in\r\nquestion. Of five married men, two with wife and two children received\r\n7s., two with wife and one child 6s., and one with wife and four small\r\nchildren 11s.’[356]\r\n\r\nIf we wish to obtain a complete picture of the social life of the\r\ntime, it is not enough to study the construction of this vindictive\r\ncode. We must remember that a sort of civil war was going on between\r\nthe labourers and the gamekeepers. The woods in which Tom Jones\r\nfought his great fight with Thwackum and Blifil to cover the flight\r\nof Molly Seagrim now echoed on a still and moonless night with the\r\ndin of a different sort of battle: the noise of gunshots and blows\r\nfrom bludgeons, and broken curses from men who knew that, if they were\r\ntaken, they would never see the English dawn rise over their homes\r\nagain: a battle which ended perhaps in the death or wounding of a\r\nkeeper or poacher, and the hanging or transportation of some of the\r\nfavourite Don Quixotes of the village. A witness before the Committee\r\non the Game Laws said that the poachers preferred a quiet night.\r\nCrabbe, in the poacher poem (Book XXI. of _Tales of the Hall_) which\r\nhe wrote at the suggestion of Romilly, takes what would seem to be the\r\nmore probable view that poachers liked a noisy night:\r\n\r\n    ‘It was a night such bold desires to move\r\n    Strong winds and wintry torrents filled the grove;\r\n    The crackling boughs that in the forest fell,\r\n    The cawing rooks, the cur’s affrighted yell;\r\n    The scenes above the wood, the floods below,\r\n    Were mix’d, and none the single sound could know;\r\n    “Loud blow the blasts,” they cried, “and call us as they blow.”’\r\n\r\nSuch an encounter is put into cold arithmetic in an official return\r\nlike this[357]:--\r\n\r\n‘An account of the nineteen persons committed to Warwick Gaol for trial\r\nat the Lent Assizes 1829 for shooting and wounding John Slinn at Combe\r\nFields in the County of Warwick whilst endeavouring to apprehend them\r\nfor destroying game in the night with the result thereof:--\r\n\r\n +---------+--------+---------------------------------------------+------------+\r\n |         |        |   Capitally convicted and reprieved with--  |            |\r\n |         |        +--------------+--------------+---------------+            |\r\n | Above 14|  Above |              |              | Imprisonment  |            |\r\n |and under|20 years|Transportation|Transportation|   with hard   | Admitted   |\r\n | 20 years| of age.|   for life.  |    for 14    |labour in House|to Evidence.|\r\n | of age. |        |              |    years.    | of Correction |            |\r\n |         |        |              |              |  for 2 years. |            |\r\n +---------+--------+--------------+--------------+---------------+------------+\r\n |   11    |    8   |       7      |      9       |       1       |      2     |\r\n +---------+--------+--------------+--------------+---------------+------------+\r\n\r\nSeven peasants exiled for life, nine exiled for fourteen years, and two\r\ncondemned to the worst exile of all. In that village at any rate there\r\nwere many homes that had reason to remember the day when the pleasures\r\nof the rich became the most sacred thing in England.\r\n\r\nBut the warfare was not conducted only by these methods. For the\r\ngentlemen of England, as for the genius who fought Michael and Gabriel\r\nin the great battle in the sixth book of _Paradise Lost_, science did\r\nnot spread her light in vain. There was a certain joy of adventure\r\nin a night skirmish, and a man who saw his wife and children slowly\r\nstarving, to whom one of those golden birds that was sleeping on its\r\nperch the other side of the hedge, night after night, till the day when\r\nit should please the squire to send a shot through its purple head,\r\nmeant comfort and even riches for a week, was not very much afraid of\r\ntrusting his life and his freedom to his quick ear, his light foot, or\r\nat the worst his powerful arm. So the game preservers invented a cold\r\nand terrible demon: they strewed their woods with spring guns, that\r\ndealt death without warning, death without the excitement of battle,\r\ndeath that could catch the nimblest as he slipped and scrambled through\r\nthe hiding bracken. The man who fell in an affray fell fighting, his\r\ncomrades by his side; it was a grim and uncomforted fate to go out\r\nslowly and alone, lying desolate in the stained bushes, beneath the\r\nunheeding sky. It is not clear when these diabolical engines, as Lord\r\nHolland called them, were first introduced, but they were evidently\r\ncommon by 1817, when Curwen made a passionate protest in the House of\r\nCommons, and declared, ‘Better the whole race of game was extinct than\r\nthat it should owe its preservation to such cruel expedients.’[358]\r\nFortunately for England the spring guns, though they scattered murder\r\nand wounds freely enough (Peel spoke in 1827 of ‘daily accidents and\r\nmisfortunes’), did not choose their victims with so nice an eye as a\r\nJustice of the Peace, and it was often a gamekeeper or a farm servant\r\nwho was suddenly tripped up by this lurking death. By 1827 this state\r\nof things had become such a scandal that Parliament intervened and\r\npassed an Act, introduced in the Lords by Lord Suffield, who had made\r\na previous attempt in 1825, to make the setting of spring guns a\r\nmisdemeanor.[359]\r\n\r\nThe Bill did not pass without considerable opposition. Tennyson, who\r\nintroduced it in the Commons, declared that the feudal nobility in\r\nancient France had never possessed a privilege comparable with this\r\nright of killing and maiming, and he said that the fact that Coke of\r\nNorfolk[360] and Lord Suffield, both large game preservers, refused\r\nto employ them showed that they were not necessary. Members of both\r\nHouses of Parliament complained bitterly of the ‘morbid sensibility’\r\nthat inspired the proposal, and some of them defended spring guns as\r\na labour-saving machine, speaking of them with the enthusiasm that\r\na manufacturer might bestow on the invention of an Arkwright or a\r\nCrompton. One member of the House of Commons, a Colonel French, opposed\r\nthe Bill with the argument that the honest English country gentleman\r\nformed ‘the very subject and essence of the English character,’ while\r\nLord Ellenborough opposed it in the other House on the ground that it\r\nwas contrary to the principles of the English law, which gave a man\r\nprotection for his property in proportion to the difficulty with which\r\nit could be defended by ordinary means.\r\n\r\nThe crime for which men were maimed or killed by these engines or\r\ntorn from their homes by summary and heartless justice was, it must\r\nbe remembered, no crime at all in the eyes of the great majority of\r\ntheir countrymen. At this time the sale of game was prohibited under\r\nstern penalties, and yet every rich man in London, from the Lord Mayor\r\ndownwards, entertained his guests with game that he had bought from\r\na poulterer. How had the poulterer bought it? There was no secret\r\nabout the business. It was explained to two Select Committees, the\r\nfirst of the House of Commons in 1823, and the second of the House of\r\nLords in 1828, by poulterers who lived by these transactions, and by\r\npolice officers who did nothing to interfere with them. Daniel Bishop,\r\nfor example, one of the chief Bow Street officers, described the\r\narrangements to the Committee in 1823.[361]\r\n\r\n‘Can you state to the Committee, how the Game is brought from the\r\npoachers up to London, or other market?... The poachers generally\r\nmeet the coachman or guards of the mails or vans, and deliver it to\r\nthem after they are out of a town, they do not deliver it in a town;\r\nthen it is brought up to London, sometimes to their agents; but the\r\ncoachmen and guards mostly have their friends in London where they\r\nknow how to dispose of it, and they have their contracts made at so\r\nmuch a brace.... There is no intermediate person between the poacher\r\nand the coachman or guard that conveys it to town?... Very seldom;\r\ngenerally the head of the gang pays the rest of the men, and he sends\r\noff the Game.... When the game arrives in London, how is it disposed\r\nof?... They have their agents, the bookkeepers at most of the inns, the\r\nporters who go out with the carts; any persons they know may go and get\r\nwhat quantity they like, by sending an order a day or two before; there\r\nare great quantities come up to Leadenhall and Newgate markets.’\r\n\r\nNobody in London thought the worse of a poulterer for buying poached\r\ngame; and nobody in the country thought any the worse of the poacher\r\nwho supplied it. A witness before the Committee in 1823 said that in\r\none village the whole of the village were poachers, ‘the constable\r\nof the village, the shoemaker and other inhabitants of the village.’\r\nAnother witness before the Lords in 1828 said that occupiers and\r\nunqualified proprietors agreed with the labourers in thinking that\r\npoaching was an innocent practice.\r\n\r\nThose who wished to reform the Game Laws argued that if the sale\r\nof game were legalised, and if the anomalous qualifications were\r\nabolished, the poacher’s prize would become much less valuable, and\r\nthe temptation would be correspondingly diminished. This view was\r\ncorroborated by the evidence given to the Select Committees. But all\r\nsuch proposals were bitterly attacked by the great majority of game\r\npreservers. Lord Londonderry urged against this reform in 1827 ‘that\r\nit would deprive the sportsman of his highest gratification ... the\r\npleasure of furnishing his friends with presents of game: nobody\r\nwould care for a present which everybody could give’![362] Other game\r\npreservers argued that it was sport that made the English gentlemen\r\nsuch good officers, on which the _Edinburgh Review_ remarked: ‘The\r\nhunting which Xenophon and Cicero praise as the best discipline for\r\nforming great generals from its being war in miniature must have been\r\nvery unlike pheasant shooting.’[363] Lord Deerhurst declared, when the\r\nproposal was made fourteen years earlier, that this was not the time to\r\ndisgust resident gentlemen. The English aristocracy, like the French,\r\nwould only consent to live in the country on their own terms. When the\r\nsquires threatened to turn _émigrés_ if anybody else was allowed to\r\nkill a rabbit, or if a poacher was not put to risk of life and limb,\r\nSydney Smith gave an answer that would have scandalised the House of\r\nCommons, ‘If gentlemen cannot breathe fresh air without injustice, let\r\nthem putrefy in Cranbourne Court.’\r\n\r\nBut what about the justice of the laws against poachers? To most\r\nmembers of Parliament there would have been an element of paradox in\r\nsuch a question. From the discussions on the subject of the Game Laws\r\na modern reader might suppose that poachers were not men of flesh and\r\nblood, but some kind of vermin. There were a few exceptions. In 1782,\r\nwhen Coke of Norfolk, acting at the instance of the magistrates of that\r\ncounty, proposed to make the Game Laws more stringent, Turner, the\r\nmember for York, made a spirited reply; he ‘exclaimed against those\r\nlaws as cruel and oppressive on the poor: he said it was a shame that\r\nthe House should always be enacting laws for the safety of gentlemen;\r\nhe wished they would make a few for the good of the poor.... For his\r\nown part, he was convinced, that if he had been a common man, he would\r\nhave been a poacher, in spite of all the laws; and he was equally\r\nsure that the too great severity of the laws was the cause that the\r\nnumber of poachers had increased so much.’[364] Fox (29th April 1796)\r\nprotested with vigour against the morality that condemned poachers\r\nwithout mercy, and condoned all the vices of the rich, but he, with\r\nSheridan, Curwen, Romilly, and a few others were an infinitesimal\r\nminority.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy had set up a code, under which a man or boy who had\r\noffended against the laws, but had done nothing for which any of his\r\nfellows imputed discredit to him, was snatched from his home, thrown\r\ninto gaol with thieves and criminals, and perhaps flung to the other\r\nside of the world, leaving his family either to go upon the rates or\r\nto pick up a living by such dishonesties as they could contrive. This\r\nlast penalty probably meant final separation. Mr. T. G. B. Estcourt,\r\nM.P., stated in evidence before the Select Committee on Secondary\r\nPunishments in 1831[365] that as men who had been transported were not\r\nbrought back at the public expense, they scarcely ever returned,[366]\r\nthat agricultural labourers specially dreaded transportation, because\r\nit meant ‘entire separation’ from ‘former associates, relations, and\r\nfriends,’ and that since he and his brother magistrates in Wiltshire\r\nhad taken to transporting more freely, committals had decreased. The\r\nspecial misery that transportation inflicted on men of this class\r\nis illustrated in Marcus Clarke’s famous novel, _For the Term of\r\nHis Natural Life_. In the passage describing the barracoon on the\r\ntransport ship, Clarke throws on the screen all the different types of\r\ncharacter--forgers, housebreakers, cracksmen, footpads--penned up in\r\nthat poisonous prison. ‘The poacher grimly thinking of his sick wife\r\nand children would start as the night-house ruffian clapped him on the\r\nshoulder and bade him with a curse to take good heart and be a man.’\r\nReaders of Mr. Hudson’s character sketches of the modern Wiltshire\r\nlabourer can imagine the scene. To the lad who had never been outside\r\nhis own village such a society must have been unspeakably alien and\r\nterrible: a ring of callous and mocking faces, hardened, by crime and\r\nwrong and base punishment, to make bitter ridicule of all the memories\r\nof home and boyhood and innocence that were surging and breaking round\r\nhis simple heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe growing brutality of the Game Laws, if it is the chief, is not the\r\nonly illustration of the extent to which the pressure of poverty was\r\ndriving the labourers to press upon law and order, and the kind of\r\nmeasures that the ruling class took to protect its property. Another\r\nillustration is the Malicious Trespass Act.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 Parliament passed an Act which provided that any person\r\nconvicted before a single J.P. within four months of the act of doing\r\nany malicious injury to any building, hedge, fence, tree, wood, or\r\nunderwood was to pay damage not exceeding £5, and if he was unable to\r\npay these damages he was to be sent to hard labour in a common gaol\r\nor House of Correction for three months. The law before the passing\r\nof this Act was as it is to-day, _i.e._ the remedy lay in an action\r\nat law against the trespasser, and the trespasser under the Act of\r\nWilliam and Mary had to pay damages. The Act of 1820 was passed without\r\nany debate that is reported in _Hansard_, but it is not unreasonable\r\nto assume that it was demanded for the protection of enclosures and\r\ngame preserves.[367] This Act exempted one set of persons entirely,\r\n‘persons engaged in hunting, and qualified persons in pursuit of game.’\r\nThese privileged gentlemen could do as much injury as they pleased.\r\n\r\nOne clause provided that every male offender under sixteen who did not\r\npay damages, and all costs and charges and expenses forthwith, might\r\nbe sent by the magistrate to hard labour in the House of Correction\r\nfor six weeks. Thus a child who broke a bough from a tree by the\r\nroadside might be sent by the magistrate, who would in many cases be\r\nthe owner of the tree, to the House of Correction, there to learn\r\nthe ways of criminals at an age when the magistrate’s own children\r\nwere about half-way through their luxurious education. This was no\r\n_brutum fulmen_. Children were sent to prison in great numbers.[368]\r\nBrougham said in 1828: ‘There was a Bill introduced by the Rt. Hon.\r\nGentleman opposite for extending the payment of expenses of witnesses\r\nand prosecutors out of the county rates. It is not to be doubted that\r\nit has greatly increased the number of Commitments, and has been\r\nthe cause of many persons being brought to trial, who ought to have\r\nbeen discharged by the Magistrates. The habit of committing, from\r\nthis and other causes, has grievously increased everywhere of late,\r\nand especially of boys. Eighteen hundred and odd, many of them mere\r\nchildren, have been committed in the Warwick district during the last\r\nseven years.’[369] The Governor of the House of Correction in Coldbath\r\nFields, giving evidence before the Committee on Secondary Punishments\r\nin 1831, said that he had under his charge a boy of ten years old\r\nwho had been in prison eight times. Capper, the Superintendent of\r\nthe Convict Establishment, told the same Committee that some of the\r\nboy convicts were so young that they could scarcely put on their\r\nclothes, and that they had to be dressed. Richard Potter’s diary for\r\n1813 contains this entry: ‘Oct. 13.--I was attending to give evidence\r\nagainst a man. Afterwards, two boys, John and Thomas Clough, aged 12\r\nand 10 years, were tried and found guilty of stealing some Irish linen\r\nout of Joseph Thorley’s warehouse during the dinner hour. The Chairman\r\nsentenced them to seven years’ transportation. On its being pronounced,\r\nthe Mother of those unfortunate boys came to the Bar to her children,\r\nand with them was in great agony, imploring mercy of the Bench. With\r\ndifficulty the children were removed. The scene was so horrifying\r\nI could remain no longer in court.’[370] Parliament put these\r\ntremendous weapons into the hands of men who believed in using them,\r\nwho administered the law on the principle by which Sir William Dyott\r\nregulated his conduct as a magistrate, that ‘nothing but the terror of\r\nhuman suffering can avail to prevent crime.’\r\n\r\nThe class that had, in Goldsmith’s words, hung round ‘our paltriest\r\npossessions with gibbetts’ never doubted its power to do full justice\r\nto the helpless creatures who tumbled into the net of the law. Until\r\n1836 a man accused of a felony was not allowed to employ counsel to\r\nmake his defence in the Court. His counsel (if he could afford to have\r\none) could examine and cross-examine witnesses, and that was all; the\r\nprisoner, whatever his condition of mind, or his condition of body,\r\nhad to answer the speech of the prosecuting counsel himself. In nine\r\ncases out of ten he was quite an unlearned man; he was swept into the\r\nglare of the Court blinking from long months of imprisonment in dark\r\ncells; the case against him was woven into a complete and perfect story\r\nby the skilled fingers of a lawyer, and it was left to this rude and\r\nilliterate man, by the aid of his own memory and his own imagination,\r\nhis life on the razor’s edge, his mind bewildered by his strange and\r\nterrible surroundings, to pick that story to pieces, to expose what was\r\nmere and doubtful inference, to put a different complexion on a long\r\nand tangled set of events, to show how a turn here or a turn there in\r\nthe narrative would change black into white and apparent guilt into\r\nmanifest innocence. Sydney Smith, whose opinions on the importance of\r\ngiving the poor a fair trial were as enlightened as his opinions on\r\ntheir proper treatment in prison were backward, has described the scene.\r\n\r\n ‘It is a most affecting moment in a Court of Justice, when the\r\n evidence has all been heard, and the Judge asks the prisoner what he\r\n has to say in his defence. The prisoner who has (by great exertions,\r\n perhaps of his friends) saved up money enough to procure Counsel, says\r\n to the Judge “that he leaves his defence to his Counsel.” We have\r\n often blushed for English humanity to hear the reply. “Your Counsel\r\n cannot speak for you, you must speak for yourself”; and this is the\r\n reply given to a poor girl of eighteen--to a foreigner--to a deaf\r\n man--to a stammerer--to the sick--to the feeble--to the old--to the\r\n most abject and ignorant of human beings!... How often have we seen a\r\n poor wretch, struggling against the agonies of his spirit, and the\r\n rudeness of his conceptions, and his awe of better-dressed men and\r\n better-taught men, and the shame which the accusation has brought upon\r\n his head, and the sight of his parents and children gazing at him in\r\n the Court, for the last time perhaps, and after a long absence!’[371]\r\n\r\nBrougham said in the House of Commons that there was no man who\r\nvisited the Criminal Courts who did not see the fearful odds against\r\nthe prisoner. This anomaly was peculiar to England, and in England it\r\nwas peculiar to cases of felony. Men tried for misdemeanours, or for\r\ntreason, or before the House of Lords could answer by the mouth of\r\ncounsel. It was only in those cases where the prisoners were almost\r\nalways poor and uneducated men and women, as Lord Althorp pointed\r\nout in an admirable speech in the House of Commons, that the accused\r\nwas left to shift for himself. Twice, in 1824 and in 1826, the House\r\nof Commons refused leave to bring in a Bill to redress this flagrant\r\ninjustice, encouraged in that refusal not only by Canning, but, what is\r\nmuch more surprising, by Peel.\r\n\r\nThe favourite argument against this reform, taking precedence of the\r\narguments that to allow persons the aid of counsel in putting their\r\nstatement of fact would make justice slower, more expensive, and more\r\ntheatrical, was the contention that the judge did, in point of fact,\r\nrepresent the interest of the prisoner: a confused plea which it did\r\nnot require any very highly developed gift of penetration to dissect.\r\nBut how far, in point of fact, were the judges able to enter into the\r\npoor prisoner’s mind? They had the power of sentencing to death for\r\nhundreds of trivial offences. It was the custom to pass the brutal\r\nsentence which the law allowed to be inflicted for felonies, and then\r\nto commute it in all except a few cases. By what considerations did\r\njudges decide when to be severe? Lord Ellenborough told Lauderdale that\r\nhe had left a man to be hanged at the Worcester Assizes because he\r\nlolled out his tongue and pretended to be an idiot, on which Lauderdale\r\nasked the Chief Justice what law there was to punish that particular\r\noffence with death. We learn from Romilly’s _Memoirs_[372] that one\r\njudge left three men to be hanged for thefts at the Maidstone Assizes\r\nbecause none of them could bring a witness to his character.\r\n\r\nThe same disposition to trust to the discretion of the judge, which\r\nCamden described as the law of tyrants, explains the vitality of the\r\nsystem of prescribing death as the punishment for hundreds of paltry\r\noffences. During the last fifty years the energy of Parliament in\r\npassing Enclosure Acts had been only rivalled by its energy in creating\r\ncapital offences. The result was a penal code which had been condemned\r\nby almost every Englishman of repute of the most various opinions, from\r\nBlackstone, Johnson, and Goldsmith to Burke and Bentham. This system\r\nmade the poor man the prey of his rich neighbours. The most furious\r\npunishments were held _in terrorem_ over the heads of prisoners, and\r\nthe wretched man who was caught in the net was exposed to all the\r\nanimosities that he might have provoked in his ordinary life. Dr. Parr\r\nput this point writing to Romilly in 1811.\r\n\r\n‘There is, indeed, one consideration in the case of bad men which\r\nought to have a greater weight than it usually has in the minds of\r\nthe Judges. Dislike from party, quarrels with servants or neighbours,\r\noffence justly or unjustly taken in a quarrel, jealousy about game, and\r\ntwenty other matters of the same sort, frequently induce men to wish to\r\nget rid of a convicted person: and well does it behove every Judge to\r\nbe sure that the person who recommends the execution of the sentence is\r\na man of veracity, of sense, of impartiality and kindness of nature in\r\nthe habitual character of his mind. I remember hearing from Sergeant\r\nWhitaker that, while he was trying a man for a capital offence at\r\nNorwich, a person brought him a message from the late Lord Suffield,\r\n“that the prisoner was a good-for-nothing fellow, and he hoped the\r\nJudge would look to him”; and the Sergeant kindled with indignation,\r\nand exclaimed in the hearing of the Court, “Zounds! would Sir Harbord\r\nHarbord have me condemn the man before I have tried him?” What Sir\r\nHarbord did during the trial, many squires and justices of the peace,\r\nupon other occasions, do after it; and were I a Judge, I should listen\r\nwith great caution to all unfavourable representations. The rich, the\r\nproud, the irascible, and the vindictive are very unfit to estimate the\r\nvalue of life to their inferiors.’[373]\r\n\r\nWe can see how the squires and the justices would close in round a man\r\nof whom they wanted, with the best intentions in the world, to rid\r\ntheir parish, woods, and warrens, when the punishment he was to receive\r\nturned on his reputation as it was estimated by the gentlemen of his\r\nneighbourhood. Was Sir Harbord Harbord very far removed from the state\r\nof mind described in the Sixth Satire of Juvenal?\r\n\r\n    ‘“Pone crucem servo.” “Meruit quo crimine servus\r\n    Supplicium? quis testis adest? quis detulit? Audi:\r\n    Nulla unquam de morte hominis cunctatio longa est.”\r\n    “O demens, ita servus homo est? nil fecerit, esto:\r\n    Hoc volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas.”’\r\n\r\nAnd Sir Harbord Harbord had in hundreds of cases what he had not in\r\nthis case, the power to wreak his anger on ‘a good-for-nothing fellow.’\r\n\r\nWhen Romilly entered on his noble crusade and tried very cautiously\r\nto persuade Parliament to repeal the death penalty in cases in which\r\nit was rarely carried out, he found the chief obstacle in his way\r\nwas the fear that became common among the governing class at this\r\ntime, the fear that existing methods of punishment were ceasing to be\r\ndeterrent. In 1810 he carried his Bill, for abolishing this penalty for\r\nthe crime of stealing privately to the amount of five shillings in a\r\nshop, through the House of Commons, and the Bill was introduced in the\r\nHouse of Lords by Lord Holland. There it was rejected by twenty-one to\r\neleven, the majority including the Archbishop of Canterbury and six\r\nother bishops.[374] The chief speeches against the Bill were made by\r\nEldon and Ellenborough. Ellenborough argued that transportation was\r\nregarded, and justly regarded, by those who violated the law as ‘a\r\nsummer airing by an easy migration to a milder climate.’\r\n\r\nThe nightmare that punishment was growing gentle and attractive to the\r\npoor came to haunt the mind of the governing class. It was founded\r\non the belief that as human wretchedness was increasing, there was a\r\nsort of law of Malthus, by which human endurance tended to outgrow the\r\nresources of repression. The agricultural labourers were sinking into\r\nsuch a deplorable plight that some of them found it a relief to be\r\ncommitted to the House of Correction, where, at least, they obtained\r\nfood and employment, and the magistrates began to fear in consequence\r\nthat ordinary punishments could no longer be regarded as deterrent,\r\nand to reason that some condition had yet to be discovered which\r\nwould be more miserable than the general existence of the poor. The\r\njustices who punished Wiltshire poachers found such an El Dorado of\r\nunhappiness in transportation. But disturbing rumours came to the ears\r\nof the authorities that transportation was not thought a very terrible\r\npunishment after all, and the Government sent out to Sir George Arthur,\r\nthe Governor of Van Diemen’s Land, certain complaints of this kind. The\r\nanswer which the Governor returned is published with the Report of the\r\nCommittee on Secondary Punishments, and the complete correspondence\r\nforms a very remarkable set of Parliamentary Papers. The Governor\r\npointed out that these complaints, which made such an impression on\r\nLord Melbourne, came from employers in Australia, who wanted to have\r\ngreater control over their servants. Arthur was no sentimentalist;\r\nhis sympathies had been drilled in two hard schools, the army and the\r\ngovernment of prisoners; his account of his own methods shows that in\r\ndescribing the life of a convict he was in no danger of falling into\r\nthe exaggerations or the rhetoric of pity. In these letters he made\r\nit very clear that nobody who knew what transportation meant could\r\never make the mistake of thinking it a light punishment. The ordinary\r\nconvict was assigned to a settler. ‘Deprived of liberty, exposed to\r\nall the caprice of the family to whose service he may happen to be\r\nassigned, and subject to the most summary laws, the condition of a\r\nconvict in no respect differs from that of a slave, except that his\r\nmaster cannot apply corporal punishment by his own hands or those\r\nof his overseer, and has a property in him for a limited period\r\nonly.’ Further, ‘idleness and insolence of expression, or even of\r\nlooks, anything betraying the insurgent spirit, subjects him to the\r\nchain-gang, or the triangle, or to hard labour on the roads.’[375]\r\nWe can imagine what the life of an ordinary convict might become. In\r\nearlier days every convict who went out began as an assigned servant,\r\nand it was only for misconduct in the colony or on the way thither that\r\nhe was sent to a Penal Settlement, but the growing alarm of the ruling\r\nclass on the subject of punishment led to a demand for more drastic\r\nsentences, and shortly after the close of our period Lord Melbourne\r\nintroduced a new system, under which convicts might be sentenced from\r\nhome to the Penal Settlement, and any judge who thought badly of a\r\nprisoner might add this hideous punishment to transportation.\r\n\r\nThe life of these Settlements has been described in one of the most\r\nvivid and terrible books ever written. Nobody can read Marcus Clarke’s\r\ngreat novel without feeling that the methods of barbarism had done\r\ntheir worst and most devilish in Macquarie Harbour and Port Arthur.\r\nThe lot of the prisoners in _Resurrection_ is by comparison a paradise.\r\nNot a single feature that can revolt and stupefy the imagination\r\nis wanting to the picture. Children of ten committing suicide, men\r\nmurdering each other by compact as an escape from a hell they could no\r\nlonger bear, prisoners receiving a death sentence with ecstasies of\r\ndelight, punishments inflicted that are indistinguishable from torture,\r\nmen stealing into the parched bush in groups, in the horrible hope that\r\none or two of them might make their way to freedom by devouring their\r\ncomrades--an atmosphere in which the last faint glimmer of self-respect\r\nand human feeling was extinguished by incessant and degrading cruelty.\r\nFew books have been written in any language more terrible to read. Yet\r\nnot a single incident or feature is imaginary: the whole picture is\r\ndrawn from the cold facts of the official reports.[376] And this system\r\nwas not the invention of some Nero or Caligula; it was the system\r\nimposed by men of gentle and refined manners, who talked to each other\r\nin Virgil and Lucan of liberty and justice, who would have died without\r\na murmur to save a French princess from an hour’s pain or shame, who\r\nput down the abominations of the Slave Trade, and allowed Clive and\r\nWarren Hastings to be indicted at the bar of public opinion as monsters\r\nof inhumanity; and it was imposed by them from the belief that as\r\nthe poor were becoming poorer, only a system of punishment that was\r\nbecoming more brutal could deter them from crime.\r\n\r\nIf we want to understand how completely all their natural feelings were\r\nlost in this absorbing fear, we must turn to the picture given by an\r\nobserver who was outside their world; an observer who could enter into\r\nthe misery of the punished, and could describe what transportation\r\nmeant to boys of nine and ten, exposed to the most brutal appetites\r\nof savage men; to chained convicts, packed for the night in boxes so\r\nnarrow that they could only lie on one side; to crushed and broken men,\r\nwhose only prayer it was to die. From him we learn how these scenes and\r\nsurroundings impressed a mind that could look upon a convict settlement\r\nas a society of living men and boys, and not merely as the Cloaca\r\nMaxima of property and order.[377]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[310] _Poor Law Report_, 1834, p. 60.\r\n\r\n[311] The big landlord under this method shared the privilege of paying\r\nthe labourer’s wages with the small farmer.\r\n\r\n[312] _Tribune_, vol. ii. p. 317.\r\n\r\n[313] _Ibid._, p. 339.\r\n\r\n[314] Poor Law Commission Report of 1834, p. 126.\r\n\r\n[315] See Curtler’s _Short History of Agriculture_, p. 249.\r\n\r\n[316] Smart, _Economic Annals_, p. 36.\r\n\r\n[317] ‘It was during the war that the cottagers of England were chiefly\r\ndeprived of the little pieces of land and garden, and made solely\r\ndependent for subsistence on the wages of their daily labour, or the\r\npoor rates.

Most of those who\r\nthought seriously about it had learnt a reasoned insensibility from\r\nthe stern Sibyl of the political economy in fashion, that strange and\r\npartial interpretation of Adam Smith, Malthus and Ricardo which was\r\nthen in full power. This political economy had robbed poverty of its\r\nsting for the rich by representing it as Nature’s medicine, bitter\r\nindeed, but less bitter than any medicine that man could prescribe.\r\nIf poverty was sharper at one time than another, this only meant\r\nthat society was more than ever in need of this medicine. But the\r\ngoverning class as a whole did not think out any such scheme or order\r\nof society, or master the new science of misery and vice. They thought\r\nof the poor not in relation to the mysterious forces of Nature, but\r\nin relation to the privileges of their own class in which they saw\r\nno mystery at all. Their state of mind is presented in a passage\r\nin Bolingbroke’s _Idea of a Patriot King_. ‘As men are apt to make\r\nthemselves the measure of all being, so they make themselves the final\r\ncause of all creation. Thus the reputed orthodox philosophers in all\r\nages have taught that the world was made for man, the earth for him\r\nto inhabit, and all the luminous bodies in the immense expanse around\r\nus for him to gaze at. Kings do no more, nay not so much, when they\r\nimagine themselves the final cause for which societies were formed and\r\ngovernments instituted.’ If we read ‘the aristocracy’ for ‘kings’ we\r\nshall have a complete analysis of the social philosophy of the ruling\r\nclass. It was from this centre that they looked out upon the world.\r\nWhen the misery of the poor reacted on their own comfort, as in the\r\ncase of poaching or crime or the pressure on the rates, they were aware\r\nof it and took measures to protect their property, but of any social\r\nproblem outside these relations they were entirely unconscious. Their\r\nphilosophy and their religion taught them that it was the duty of the\r\nrich to be benevolent, and of the poor to be patient and industrious.\r\nThe rich were ready to do their part, and all they asked of the poor\r\nwas that they should learn to bear their lot with resignation. Burke\r\nhad laid down the true and full philosophy of social life once and for\r\nall. ‘Good order is the foundation of all good things. To be enabled\r\nto acquire, the people, without being servile, must be tractable and\r\nobedient. The magistrate must have his reverence, the laws their\r\nauthority. The body of the people must not find the principles of\r\nnatural subordination by art rooted out of their minds. They must\r\nrespect that property of which they cannot partake. They must labour\r\nto obtain what by labour can be obtained; and when they find, as\r\nthey commonly do, the success disproportioned to the endeavour, they\r\nmust be taught their consolation in the final proportions of eternal\r\njustice.’[378]\r\n\r\nThe upper classes, looking upon the world in this way, considered that\r\nit was the duty of the poor man to adapt himself, his tastes, his\r\nhabits, and his ambitions, to the arrangements of a society which it\r\nhad pleased Providence to organise on this interesting plan. We have\r\nin the pages of Eden the portrait of the ideal poor woman, whose life\r\nshowed what could be done if poverty were faced in the proper spirit.\r\n‘Anne Hurst was born at Witley in Surrey; there she lived the whole\r\nperiod of a long life, and there she died. As soon as she was thought\r\nable to work, she went to service: there, before she was twenty, she\r\nmarried James Strudwick, who, like her own father, was a day labourer.\r\nWith this husband she lived, a prolific, hard-working, contented wife,\r\nsomewhat more than fifty years. He worked more than threescore years on\r\none farm, and his wages, summer and winter, were regularly a shilling a\r\nday. He never asked more nor was never offered less. They had between\r\nthem seven children: and lived to see six daughters married and three\r\nthe mothers of sixteen children: all of whom were brought up, or are\r\nbringing up, to be day labourers. Strudwick continued to work till\r\nwithin seven weeks of the day of his death, and at the age of four\r\nscore, in 1787, he closed, in peace, a not inglorious life; for, to the\r\nday of his death, he never received a farthing in the way of parochial\r\naid. His wife survived him about seven years, and though bent with age\r\nand infirmities, and little able to work, excepting as a weeder in a\r\ngentleman’s garden, she also was too proud to ask or receive any relief\r\nfrom the parish. For six or seven of the last years of her life, she\r\nreceived twenty shillings a year from the person who favoured me with\r\nthis account, which he drew up from her own mouth. With all her virtue,\r\nand all her merit, she yet was not much liked in her neighbourhood;\r\npeople in affluence thought her haughty, and the Paupers of the parish,\r\nseeing, as they could not help seeing, that her life was a reproach\r\nto theirs, aggravated all her little failings. Yet, the worst thing\r\nthey had to say of her was, that she was proud; which, they said, was\r\nmanifested by the way in which she buried her husband. Resolute, as she\r\nowned she was, to have the funeral, and everything that related to it,\r\nwhat she called decent, nothing could dissuade her from having handles\r\nto his coffin and a plate on it, mentioning his age. She was also\r\ncharged with having behaved herself crossly and peevishly towards one\r\nof her sons-in-law, who was a mason and went regularly every Saturday\r\nevening to the ale house as he said just to drink a pot of beer.\r\nJames Strudwick in all his life, as she often told this ungracious\r\nson-in-law, never spent five shillings in any idleness: luckily (as\r\nshe was sure to add) he had it not to spend. A more serious charge\r\nagainst her was that, living to a great age, and but little able to\r\nwork, she grew to be seriously afraid, that, at last, she might become\r\nchargeable to the parish (the heaviest, in her estimation, of all human\r\ncalamities), and that thus alarmed she did suffer herself more than\r\nonce, during the exacerbations of a fit of distempered despondency,\r\npeevishly (and perhaps petulantly) to exclaim that God Almighty, by\r\nsuffering her to remain so long upon earth, seemed actually to have\r\nforgotten her.’ ‘Such,’ concludes Eden, ‘are the simple annals of Dame\r\nStrudwick: and her historian, partial to his subject, closes it with\r\nlamenting that such village memoirs have not oftener been sought for\r\nand recorded.’[379] This was the ideal character for the cottage. How\r\nEden or anybody else would have hated this poor woman in whom every\r\nkindly feeling had been starved to death if she had been in his own\r\nclass! We know from Creevey what his friends thought of ‘the stingy\r\nkip’ Lambton when they found themselves under his roof, where ‘a round\r\nof beef at a side table was run at with as much keenness as a banker’s\r\nshop before a stoppage.’ A little peevishness or even petulance with\r\nGod Almighty would not have seemed the most serious charge that could\r\nbe brought against such a neighbour. But if every villager had had Dame\r\nStrudwick’s hard and narrow virtues, and had crushed all other tastes\r\nand interests in the passion for living on a shilling a day in a cold\r\nand bitter independence, the problem of preserving the monopolies of\r\nthe few without disorder or trouble would have been greatly simplified.\r\nThere would have been little danger, as Burke would have said, that the\r\nfruits of successful industry and the accumulations of fortune would\r\nbe exposed to ‘the plunder of the negligent, the disappointed, and the\r\nunprosperous.’\r\n\r\nThe way in which the ruling class regarded the poor is illustrated in\r\nthe tone of the discussions when the problem of poverty had become\r\nacute at the end of the eighteenth century. When Pitt, who had been\r\npestered by Eden to read his book, handed a volume to Canning, then his\r\nsecretary, that brilliant young politician spent his time writing a\r\nparody on the grotesque names to be found in the Appendix, and it will\r\nbe recollected that Pitt excused himself for abandoning his scheme for\r\nreforming the Poor Law, on the ground that he was inexperienced in the\r\ncondition of the poor. It was no shame to a politician to be ignorant\r\nof such subjects. The poor were happy or unhappy in the view of the\r\nruling class according to the sympathy the rich bestowed on them. If\r\nthere were occasional misgivings they were easily dispelled. Thus one\r\nphilosopher pointed out that though the position of the poor man might\r\nseem wanting in dignity or independence, it should be remembered by way\r\nof consolation that he could play the tyrant over his wife and children\r\nas much as he liked.[380] Another train of soothing reflections was\r\nstarted by such papers as that published in the _Annals of Agriculture_\r\nin 1797, under the title ‘On the Comforts enjoyed by the Cottagers\r\ncompared to those of the ancient Barons.’ In such a society a sentiment\r\nlike that expressed by Fox when supporting Whitbread’s Bill in 1795,\r\nthat ‘it was not fitting in a free country that the great body of the\r\npeople should depend on the charity of the rich,’ seemed a challenging\r\nparadox. Eden thought this an extraordinary way of looking at the\r\nproblem, and retorted that it was gratifying to see how ready the rich\r\nwere to bestow their benevolent attentions. This was the point of view\r\nof Pitt and of almost all the speakers in the debate that followed\r\nFox’s outburst, Buxton going so far as to say that owing to those\r\nattentions the condition of the poor had never been ‘so eligible.’ Just\r\nas the boisterous captain in _Evelina_ thought it was an honour to a\r\nwretched Frenchwoman to be rolled in British mud, so the English House\r\nof Commons thought that poverty was turned into a positive blessing by\r\nthe kindness of the rich.\r\n\r\nWriting towards the end of the ancient régime, Cobbett maintained\r\nthat in his own lifetime the tone and language of society about the\r\npoor had changed very greatly for the worse, that the old name of\r\n‘the commons of England’ had given way to such names as ‘the lower\r\norders,’ ‘the peasantry,’ and ‘the population,’ and that when the poor\r\nmet together to demand their rights they were invariably spoken of by\r\nsuch contumelious terms as ‘the populace’ or ‘the mob.’ ‘In short,\r\nby degrees beginning about fifty years ago the industrious part of\r\nthe community, particularly those who create every useful thing by\r\ntheir labour, have been spoken of by everyone possessing the power\r\nto oppress them in any degree in just the same manner in which we\r\nspeak of the animals which compose the stock upon a farm. This is not\r\nthe manner in which the forefathers of us, the common people, were\r\ntreated.’[381] Such language, Cobbett said, was to be heard not only\r\nfrom ‘tax-devourers, bankers, brewers, monopolists of every sort, but\r\nalso from their clerks, from the very shopkeepers and waiters, and from\r\nthe fribbles stuck up behind the counter to do the business that ought\r\nto be done by a girl.’ This is perhaps only another way of saying that\r\nthe isolation of the poor was becoming a more and more conspicuous\r\nfeature of English society.\r\n\r\nMany causes combined to destroy the companionship of classes, and most\r\nof all the break-up of the old village which followed on the enclosures\r\nand the consolidation of farms. In the old village, labourers and\r\ncottagers and small farmers were neighbours. They knew each other\r\nand lived much the same kind of life. The small farmer was a farmer\r\none day of the week and a labourer another; he married, according to\r\nCobbett, the domestic servant of the gentry, a fact that explains the\r\nremark of Sophia Western’s maid to the landlady of the inn, ‘and let\r\nme have the bacon cut very nice and thin, for I can’t endure anything\r\nthat’s gross. Prythee try if you can’t do a little tolerably for once;\r\nand don’t think you have a farmer’s wife or some of those creatures\r\nin the house.’ The new farmer lived in a different latitude. He\r\nmarried a young lady from the boarding school. He often occupied the\r\nold manor house.[382] He was divided from the labourer by his tastes,\r\nhis interests, his ambitions, his display and whole manner of life.\r\nThe change that came over the English village in consequence was\r\napparent to all observers with social insight. When Goldsmith wanted to\r\ndescribe a happy village he was careful to choose a village of the old\r\nkind, with the farmers ‘strangers alike to opulence and to poverty,’\r\nand Crabbe, to whose sincere and realist pen we owe much of our\r\nknowledge of the social life of the time, gives a particularly poignant\r\nimpression of the cold and friendless atmosphere that surrounded the\r\npoor:\r\n\r\n    ‘Where Plenty smiles, alas! she smiles for few,\r\n    And those who taste not, yet behold her store,\r\n    Are as the slaves that dig the golden ore,\r\n    The wealth around them makes them doubly poor.’[383]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most vivid account of the change is given in a letter from\r\nCobbett in the _Political Register_ for 17th March 1821,[384] addressed\r\nto Mr. Gooch:--\r\n\r\n ‘I hold a return to _small farms_ to be _absolutely necessary_ to a\r\n restoration to anything like an English community; and I am quite\r\n sure, that the ruin of the present race of farmers, generally, is\r\n a necessary preliminary to this.... The life of the husbandman\r\n cannot be that of _a gentleman_ without injury to society at large.\r\n When farmers become _gentlemen_ their labourers become _slaves_. A\r\n _Virginian_ farmer, as he is called, very much resembles a _great\r\n farmer_ in England; but then, the Virginian’s work is done by slaves.\r\n It is in those States of America, where the farmer is only the\r\n _first labourer_ that all the domestic virtues are to be found, and\r\n all that public-spirit and that valour, which are the safeguards\r\n of American independence, freedom, and happiness. You, Sir, with\r\n others, complain of the increase of the _poor-rates_. But, you seem\r\n to forget, that, in the destruction of the small farms, as separate\r\n farms, small-farmers have become mere hired labourers.... Take\r\n England throughout _three farms have been turned into one within\r\n fifty years_, and the far greater part of the change has taken place\r\n within the last _thirty years_; that is to say, since the commencement\r\n of the deadly system of PITT. Instead of families of small farmers\r\n with all their exertions, all their decency of dress and of manners,\r\n and all their scrupulousness as to character, we have _families of\r\n paupers_, with all the improvidence and wrecklessness belonging to an\r\n irrevocable sentence of poverty for life. Mr. CURWEN in his _Hints on\r\n Agriculture_, observes that he saw some where in Norfolk, I believe\r\n it was, _two hundred_ farmers worth from _five to ten thousand pounds\r\n each_; and exclaims “What a _glorious_ sight!” In commenting on this\r\n passage in the Register, in the year 1810, I observed “Mr. CURWEN only\r\n saw the _outside_ of the sepulchre; if he had seen the _two or three\r\n thousand_ half-starved labourers of these two hundred farmers, and the\r\n _five or six thousand_ ragged wives and children of those labourers;\r\n if the farmers had brought those with them, the sight would not have\r\n been so _glorious_.”’\r\n\r\nA practice referred to in the same letter of Cobbett’s that tended\r\nto widen the gulf between the farmer and the labourer was the\r\nintroduction of bailiffs: ‘Along with enormous prices for corn came\r\nin the employment of _Bailiffs_ by farmers, a natural consequence of\r\nlarge farms; and to what a degree of insolent folly the system was\r\nleading, may be guessed from an observation of Mr. ARTHUR YOUNG, who\r\nrecommended, that the Bailiff should have a good horse to ride, and\r\na _bottle of port wine every day at his dinner_: while in the same\r\nwork, Mr. YOUNG gives great numbers of rules for saving labour upon\r\na farm. A pretty sort of farm where the bailiff was to have a bottle\r\nof port wine at his dinner! The custom was, too, to bring bailiffs\r\nfrom some _distant part_, in order to prevent them from having any\r\nfeeling of compassion for the labourers. _Scotch_ bailiffs above\r\nall, were preferred, as being thought harder than any others that\r\ncould be obtained; and thus (with shame I write the words!) the farms\r\nof _England_, like those of _Jamaica_, were supplied with drivers\r\nfrom Scotland!... Never was a truer saying, than that of the common\r\npeople, that a Scotchman makes a “good _sole_, but a d----d bad _upper\r\nleather_.”’[385] Bamford, speaking of 1745, says: ‘Gentlemen then lived\r\nas they ought to live: as real gentlemen will ever be found living: in\r\nkindliness with their neighbours; in openhanded charity towards the\r\npoor, and in hospitality towards all friendly comers. There were no\r\ngrinding bailiffs and land stewards in those days to stand betwixt the\r\ngentleman and his labourer or his tenant: to screw up rents and screw\r\ndown livings, and to invent and transact all little meannesses for so\r\nmuch per annum.’[386] Cobbett’s prejudice against Scotsmen, the race of\r\n‘feelosofers,’ blinded him to virtues which were notoriously theirs, as\r\nin his round declaration that all the hard work of agriculture was done\r\nby Englishmen and Irishmen, and that the Scotsmen chose such tasks as\r\n‘peeping into melon frames.’ But that his remarks upon the subject of\r\nthe introduction of Scottish bailiffs reflected a general feeling may\r\nbe seen from a passage in Miss Austen’s _Emma_, ‘Mr. Graham intends to\r\nhave a Scotch bailiff for his new estate. Will it answer? Will not the\r\nold prejudice be too strong?’\r\n\r\nThe change in the status of the farmer came at a time of a general\r\ngrowth of luxury. All classes above the poor adopted a more extravagant\r\nand ostentatious style and scale of living. This was true, for example,\r\nof sporting England. Fox-hunting dates from this century. Before the\r\neighteenth century the amusement of the aristocracy was hunting the\r\nstag, and that of the country squire was hunting the hare. It was\r\nbecause Walpole kept beagles at Richmond and used to hunt once a week\r\nthat the House of Commons has always made Saturday a holiday. In the\r\nPeninsular War, Wellington kept a pack of hounds at headquarters, but\r\nthey were fox-hounds. In its early days fox-hunting had continued the\r\nsimpler traditions of hare-hunting, and each small squire kept a few\r\ncouple of hounds and brought them to the meet. Gray has described his\r\nuncle’s establishment at Burnham, where every chair in the house was\r\ntaken up by a dog. But as the century advanced the sport was organised\r\non a grander scale: the old buck-hounds and slow horses were superseded\r\nby more expensive breeds, and far greater distances were covered.\r\nFox-hunting became the amusement both of the aristocracy and of the\r\nsquires, and it resembled rather the pomp and state of stag-hunting\r\nthan the modest pleasures of Walpole and his friends. In all other\r\ndirections there was a general increase of magnificence in life. The\r\neighteenth century was the century of great mansions, and some of\r\nthe most splendid palaces of the aristocracy were built during the\r\ndistress and famine of the French war. The ambitions of the aristocracy\r\nbecame the ambitions of the classes that admired them, as we know\r\nfrom Smollett, and Sir William Scott in 1802, speaking in favour of\r\nthe non-residence of the clergy, ‘expressly said that they and their\r\nfamilies ought to appear at watering-places, and that this was amongst\r\nthe means of making them respected by their flocks!’[387]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rich and the poor were thus growing further and further apart, and\r\nthere was nobody in the English village to interpret these two worlds\r\nto each other. M. Babeau has pointed out that in France, under the\r\nancient régime, the lawyers represented and defended in some degree\r\nthe rights of the peasants. This was one consequence of the constant\r\nlitigation between peasants and seigneurs over communal property.\r\nThe lawyers who took the side of the peasants lived at their expense\r\nit is true, but they rendered public services, they presented the\r\npeasants’ case before public opinion, and they understood their ideas\r\nand difficulties. This explains a striking feature of the French\r\nRevolution, the large number of local lawyers who became prominent\r\nas champions of revolutionary ideas. One of Burke’s chief complaints\r\nof the Constituent Assembly was that it contained so many country\r\nattorneys and notaries, ‘the fomenters and conductors of the petty war\r\nof village vexation.’[388] In England the lawyers never occupied this\r\nposition, and it is impossible to imagine such a development taking\r\nplace there. The lawyers who interested themselves in the poor were\r\nenlisted not in the defence of the rights of the commoners but in the\r\ndefence of the purses of the parishes. For them the all-important\r\nquestion was not what rights the peasant had against his lord, but on\r\nwhich parish he had a claim for maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe causes of litigation were endless: if a man rented a tenement of\r\nthe annual value of £10 he acquired a settlement. But his rental might\r\nnot have represented the annual value, and so the further question\r\nwould come up, Was the annual value actually £10? ‘If it may be really\r\nnot far from that sum, and the family of the pauper be numerous, the\r\ninterests of the contending parishes, supported by the conflicting\r\nopinions of their respective surveyors, leads to the utmost expense\r\nand extremity of litigation.’[389] If the annual value were not in\r\ndispute there might be nice and intricate questions about the kind of\r\ntenement and the nature of the tenure: if the settlement was claimed\r\nin virtue of a contract of hiring, was the contract ‘general, special,\r\ncustomary, retrospective, conditional, personal’ or what not?[390] If\r\nthe settlement was claimed in virtue of apprenticeship,[391] what was\r\nthe nature of the indentures and so on. If claimed for an estate of\r\n£30, was the estate really worth £30, and how was it acquired? These\r\nare a few of the questions in dispute, and to add to the confusion ‘on\r\nno branch of the law have the judgments of the superior court been so\r\ncontradictory.’[392]\r\n\r\nThus the principal occupation of those lawyers whose business brought\r\nthem into the world of the poor was of a nature to draw their\r\nsympathies and interests to the side of the possessing classes, and\r\nwhereas peasants’ ideas were acclimatised outside their own class in\r\nFrance as a consequence of the character of rural litigation and of\r\nrural lawyers, the English villager came before the lawyer, not as a\r\nclient, but as a danger; not as a person whose rights and interests\r\nhad to be explored and studied, but as a person whose claims on the\r\nparish had to be parried or evaded. It is not surprising, therefore,\r\nto find that both Fielding and Smollett lay great stress on the\r\nreputation of lawyers for harshness and extortion in their treatment\r\nof the poor, regarding them, like Carlyle, as ‘attorneys and law\r\nbeagles who hunt ravenous on the earth.’ Readers of the adventures\r\nof Sir Launcelot Greaves will remember Tom Clarke ‘whose goodness\r\nof heart even the exercise of his profession had not been able to\r\ncorrupt. Before strangers he never owned himself an attorney without\r\nblushing, though he had no reason to blush for his own practice, for he\r\nconstantly refused to engage in the cause of any client whose character\r\nwas equivocal, and was never known to act with such industry as when\r\nconcerned for the widow and orphan or any other object that sued _in\r\nforma pauperis_.’ Fielding speaks in a foot-note to _Tom Jones_ of\r\nthe oppression of the poor by attorneys, as a scandal to the law, the\r\nnation, Christianity, and even human nature itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was another class that might, under different circumstances, have\r\nhelped to soothe and soften the isolation of the poor, but the position\r\nand the sympathies of the English Church made this impossible. This\r\nwas seen very clearly by Adam Smith, who was troubled by the fear that\r\n‘enthusiasm,’ the religious force so dreaded by the men of science and\r\nreason, would spread among the poor, because the clergy who should have\r\ncontrolled and counteracted it were so little in touch with the mass\r\nof the people. Under the government of the Anglican Church, as set up\r\nby the Reformation, he pointed out, ‘the clergy naturally endeavour\r\nto recommend themselves to the sovereign, to the court, and to the\r\nnobility and gentry of the country, by whose influence they chiefly\r\nexpect to obtain preferment.’[393] He added that such a clergy are very\r\napt to neglect altogether the means of maintaining their influence and\r\nauthority with the lower ranks of life. The association of the Anglican\r\nChurch with the governing class has never been more intimate and\r\nbinding than it was during the eighteenth century. This was true alike\r\nof bishops and of clergy. The English bishop was not a gay Voltairean\r\nlike the French, but he was just as zealous a member of the privileged\r\norders, and the system over which he presided and which he defended\r\nwas a faint copy of the gloriously coloured scandals of the French\r\nChurch. The prelates who lived upon those scandals were described by\r\nRobespierre, with a humour that he did not often indulge, as treating\r\nthe deity in the same way as the mayor of the palace used to treat\r\nthe French kings. ‘Ils l’ont traité comme jadis les maires du palais\r\ntraitèrent les descendants de Clovis pour régner sous son nom et se\r\nmettre à sa place. Ils l’ont relégué dans le ciel comme dans un palais,\r\net ne l’ont appelé sur la terre que pour demander à leur profit des\r\ndîmes, des richesses, des honneurs, des plaisirs et de la puissance.’\r\nWhen Archbishop Dillon declared against the civil constitution he said\r\nthat he and his colleagues acted as gentlemen and not as theologians.\r\nThe Archbishop of Aix spoke of tithes as a voluntary offering\r\nfrom the piety of the faithful. ‘As to that,’ said the Duke de la\r\nRochefoucault, ‘there are now forty thousand cases in the Courts.’\r\nBoth these archbishops would have found themselves quite at home among\r\nthe spiritual peers in the House of Lords, where the same decorous\r\nhypocrisies mingled with the same class atmosphere. For the English\r\nbishops, though they were not libertines like the French, never learnt\r\nso to be Christians as to forget to be aristocrats, and their religious\r\nduties were never allowed to interfere with the demands of scholarship\r\nor of pleasure. Perhaps the most distinguished product of this régime\r\nwas Bishop Watson of Llandaff, who invented an improved gunpowder\r\nand defended Christianity against Paine and Gibbon. These were his\r\ndiversions; his main business was carried on at his magnificent country\r\nseat on the banks of Windermere. He was bishop for thirty-four years,\r\nand during the whole of that time he never lived within his diocese,\r\npreferring to play the part of the grand seigneur planting trees in\r\nWestmorland. He has left a sympathetic and charming account of what\r\nhe modestly calls his retirement from public life, an event not to be\r\nconfused with abdication of his see, and of how he built the palace\r\nwhere he spent the emoluments of Llandaff and the long autumn of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt was natural to men who lived in this atmosphere to see politics\r\nthrough the spectacles of the aristocracy. To understand how strongly\r\nthe view that the Church existed to serve the aristocracy, and the\r\nrest of the State through the aristocracy, was fixed in the minds of\r\nthe higher clergy, we have only to look at the case of a reformer\r\nlike Bishop Horsley. The bishop is chiefly known as a preacher, a\r\ncontroversialist, and the author of the celebrated dictum that the\r\npoor had nothing to do with the laws except to obey them. His battle\r\nwith Priestley has been compared to the encounter of Bentley and\r\nCollins, a comparison that may not give Horsley more, but certainly\r\ngives Priestley less than his due. When he preached before the House\r\nof Lords on the death of Louis XVI. his audience rose and stood in\r\nsilent reverence during his peroration. The cynical may feel that it\r\nwas not difficult to inspire emotion and awe in such a congregation\r\non such a subject at such a time, but we know from De Quincey that\r\nHorsley’s reputation as a preacher stood remarkably high. He was one\r\nof the leaders of the Church in politics; for our purposes it is more\r\nimportant to note that he was one of the reforming bishops. Among other\r\nscandals he attacked the scandal of non-residence, and he may be taken\r\nas setting in this regard the strictest standard of his time; yet he\r\ndid not scruple to go and live in Oxford for some years as tutor to\r\nLord Guernsey, during the time that he was Rector of Newington, as\r\nplain a confession as we could want that in the estimation of the most\r\npublic-spirited of the clergy the nobility had the first claims on the\r\nChurch. These social sympathies were confirmed by common political\r\ninterests. The privileges of the aristocracy and of the bishops were\r\nin fact bound up together, and both bishops and aristocracy had good\r\nreason to shrink from breaking a thread anywhere. Perhaps the malicious\r\nwould find the most complete and piquant illustration of the relations\r\nof the Church and the governing class in the letter written by Dr.\r\nGoodenough to Addington, who had just made him Dean of Rochester, when\r\nthe clerkship of the Pells, worth £3000 a year, was about to become\r\nvacant. ‘I understand that Colonel Barré is in a very precarious\r\nstate. I hope you will have the fortitude to nominate Harry to be\r\nhis successor.’ Harry, Addington’s son, was a boy at Winchester. The\r\nfather’s fortitude rose to the emergency: the dean blossomed a little\r\nlater into a bishop.\r\n\r\nBut if the French and the English bishops both belonged to the\r\naristocracy in feelings and in habits, a great difference distinguishes\r\nthe rank and file of the clergy in the two countries. The French priest\r\nbelonged by circumstances and by sympathy to the peasant class. The\r\nbishop regarded the country curé as _un vilain sentant le fumier_, and\r\ntreated him with about as much consideration as the seigneur showed\r\nto his dependants. The priest’s quarrel with the bishop was like the\r\npeasant’s quarrel with the seigneur: for both priest and peasant\r\nsmarted under the arrogant airs of their respective superiors, and\r\nthe bishop swallowed up the tithes as the seigneur swallowed up the\r\nfeudal dues. Sometimes the curé put himself at the head of a local\r\nrebellion. In the reign of Louis XV. the priests round Saint-Germain\r\nled out their flocks to destroy the game which devoured their crops,\r\nthe campaign being announced and sanctified from the pulpit. In the\r\nRevolution the common clergy were largely on the side of the peasants.\r\nSuch a development was inconceivable in England. As the curé’s windows\r\nlooked to the village, the parson’s windows looked to the hall. When\r\nthe parson’s circumstances enabled him to live like the squire, he rode\r\nto hounds, for though, as Blackstone tells us, Roman Canon Law, under\r\nthe influence of the tradition that St. Jerome had once observed that\r\nthe saints had eschewed such diversions, had interdicted _venationes et\r\nsylvaticas vagationes cum canibus et accipitribus_ to all clergymen,\r\nthis early severity of life had vanished long before the eighteenth\r\ncentury. He treated the calls of his profession as trifling accidents\r\ninterrupting his normal life of vigorous pleasure. On becoming Bishop\r\nof Chester, Dr. Blomfield astonished the diocese by refusing to license\r\na curate until he had promised to abstain from hunting, and by the pain\r\nand surprise with which he saw one of his clergy carried away drunk\r\nfrom a visitation dinner. One rector, whom he rebuked for drunkenness,\r\nreplied with an injured manner that he was never drunk on duty.\r\n\r\nThere were, it is true, clergymen of great public spirit and devoted\r\nlives, and such men figure in these pages, but the Church, as a whole,\r\nwas an easy-going society, careful of its pleasures and comforts,\r\nliving with the moral ideas and as far as possible in the manner of\r\nthe rich. The rivalry of the Methodist movement had given a certain\r\nstimulus to zeal, and the Vicar of Corsley in Wilts,[394] for example,\r\nadded a second service to the duties of the Sunday, though guarding\r\nhimself expressly against the admission of any obligation to make it\r\npermanent. But it was found impossible to eradicate from the system\r\ncertain of the vices that belong to a society which is primarily a\r\nclass. Some of the bishops set themselves to reduce the practice of\r\nnon-residence. Porteus, Bishop of London, devoted a great part of his\r\ncharge to his clergy in 1790 to this subject, and though he pleaded\r\npassionately for reform he cannot be said to have shut his eyes to\r\nthe difficulties of the clergy. ‘There are, indeed, two impediments\r\nto constant residence which cannot easily be surmounted; the first\r\nis (what unfortunately prevails in some parts of this diocese)\r\nunwholesomeness of situation; the other is the possession of a second\r\nbenefice. Yet even these will not justify _a total and perpetual_\r\nabsence from your cures. The unhealthiness of many places is of late\r\nyears by various improvements greatly abated, and there are now few so\r\ncircumstanced as not to admit of residence there in _some_ part of the\r\nyear without any danger to the constitution.’ Thus even Bishop Porteus,\r\nwho in this very charge reminded the clergy that they were called by\r\nthe titles of stewards, watchmen, shepherds, and labourers, never went\r\nthe length of thinking that the Church was to be expected to minister\r\nto the poor in all weathers and in all climates.\r\n\r\nThe exertions of the reforming bishops did not achieve a conspicuous\r\nsuccess, for the second of the difficulties touched on by Porteus was\r\ninsurmountable. In his _Legacy to Parsons_, Cobbett, quoting from the\r\n_Clerical Guide_, showed that 332 parsons shared the revenues of 1496\r\nparishes, and 500 more shared those of 1524. Among the pluralists were\r\nLord Walsingham, who besides enjoying a pension of £700 a year, was\r\nArchdeacon of Surrey, Prebendary of Winchester, Rector of Calbourne,\r\nRector of Fawley, perpetual Curate of Exbury, and Rector of Merton; the\r\nEarl of Guildford, Rector of Old Alresford, Rector of New Alresford,\r\nperpetual Curate of Medsted, Rector of St. Mary, Southampton, including\r\nthe great parish of South Stoneham, Master of St. Cross Hospital, with\r\nthe revenue of the parish of St. Faith along with it. There were three\r\nPretymans dividing fifteen benefices, and Wellington’s brother was\r\nPrebendary of Durham, Rector of Bishopwearmouth, Rector of Chelsea, and\r\nRector of Therfield. This method of treating the parson’s profession\r\nas a comfortable career was so closely entangled in the system of\r\naristocracy, that no Government which represented those interests\r\nwould ever dream of touching it. Parliament intervened indeed, but\r\nintervened to protect those who lived on these abuses. For before 1801\r\nthere were Acts of Parliament on the Statute Book (21 Henry VIII. c.\r\n13, and 13 Elizabeth c. 20), which provided certain penalties for\r\nnon-residence. In 1799 a certain Mr. Williams laid informations against\r\nhundreds of the clergy for offences against these Acts. Parliament\r\nreplied by passing a series of Acts to stay proceedings, and finally\r\nin 1803 Sir William Scott, member for the University of Oxford, passed\r\nan Act which allowed the bishops to authorise parsons to reside out of\r\ntheir parishes. It is not surprising to find that in 1812, out of ten\r\nthousand incumbents, nearly six thousand were non-resident.\r\n\r\nIn the parishes where the incumbent was non-resident, if there was a\r\nclergyman at all in the place, it was generally a curate on a miserable\r\npittance. Bishop Porteus, in the charge already mentioned, gives some\r\ninteresting information about the salaries of curates: ‘It is also\r\nhighly to the honour of this Diocese that in general the stipends\r\nallowed to the curates are more liberal than in many other parts of the\r\nkingdom. In several instances I find that the stipend for one church\r\nonly is £50 a year; for two £60 and the use of a parsonage; and in the\r\nunwholesome parts of the Diocese £70 and even £80 (that is £40 for each\r\nchurch), with the same indulgence of a house to reside in.’ Many of the\r\nparishes did not see much of the curate assigned to them. ‘A man must\r\nhave travelled very little in the kingdom,’ said Arthur Young in 1798,\r\n‘who does not know that country towns abound with curates who never\r\nsee the parishes they serve, but when they are absolutely forced to it\r\nby duty.’[395] But the ill-paid curate, even when he was resident and\r\nconscientious, as he often was, moved like the pluralist rector in the\r\norbit of the rich. He was in that world though not of it. All his hopes\r\nhung on the squire. To have taken the side of the poor against him\r\nwould have meant ruin, and the English Church was not a nursery of this\r\nkind of heroism. It is significant that almost every eighteenth-century\r\nnovelist puts at least one sycophantic parson in his or her gallery of\r\nportraits.[396]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the social ties that drew the clergy to the aristocracy,\r\nthere was a powerful economic hindrance to their friendship with the\r\npoor. De Tocqueville thought that the tithe system brought the French\r\npriest into interesting and touching relations with the peasant: a view\r\nthat has seemed fanciful to later historians, who are more impressed\r\nby the quarrels that resulted. But De Tocqueville himself could\r\nscarcely argue that the tithe system helped to warm the heart of the\r\nlabourer to the Church of England in cases such as those recorded in\r\nthe Parliamentary Paper issued in 1833, in which parson magistrates\r\nsent working men to prison for refusing to pay tithes to their rector.\r\nDay labouring men had originally been exempted from liability to pay\r\ntithes, but just as the French Church brought more and more of the\r\nproperty and industry of the State within her confiscating grasp,\r\nso the English Parliament, from the reign of William III., had been\r\ndrawing the parson’s net more closely round the labourer. Moreover,\r\nas we shall see in a later chapter, the question of tithes was in the\r\nvery centre of the social agitations that ended in the rising of 1830\r\nand its terrible punishment. In this particular quarrel the farmers and\r\nlabourers were on the same side, and the parsons as a body stood out\r\nfor their own property with as much determination as the landlords.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the Church took an active part in oppressing the\r\nvillage poor, for Wilberforce and his friends started, just before\r\nthe French Revolution, a Society for the Reformation of Manners,\r\nwhich aimed at enforcing the observance of Sunday, forbidding any\r\nkind of social dissipation, and repressing freedom of speech and of\r\nthought whenever they refused to conform to the superstitions of the\r\nmorose religion that was then in fashion. This campaign was directed\r\nagainst the license of the poor alone. There were no stocks for the\r\nSabbath-breakers of Brooks’s: a Gibbon might take what liberties he\r\npleased with religion: the wildest Methodist never tried to shackle the\r\nloose tongues or the loose lives of the gay rich. The attitude of the\r\nChurch to the excesses of this class is well depicted in Fielding’s\r\naccount of Parson Supple, who never remonstrated with Squire Western\r\nfor swearing, but preached so vigorously in the pulpit against the\r\nhabit that the authorities put the laws very severely in execution\r\nagainst others, ‘and the magistrate was the only person in the parish\r\nwho could swear with impunity.’ This description might seem to border\r\non burlesque, but there is an entry in Wilberforce’s diary that reveals\r\na state of mind which even Fielding would have found it impossible\r\nto caricature. Wilberforce was staying at Brighton, and this is his\r\ndescription of an evening he spent at the Pavilion with the first\r\ngentleman of Europe: ‘The Prince and Duke of Clarence too very civil.\r\nPrince showed he had read Cobbett. Spoke strongly of the blasphemy of\r\nhis late papers and most justly.’[397] We can only hope that Sheridan\r\nwas there to enjoy the scene, and that the Prince was able for once\r\nto do justice to his strong feelings in language that would not shock\r\nWilberforce’s ears.\r\n\r\nMen like Wilberforce and the magistrates whom he inspired did not\r\npunish the rich for their dissolute behaviour; they only found in that\r\nbehaviour another argument for coercing the poor. As they watched\r\nthe dishevelled lives of men like George Selwyn, their one idea of\r\naction was to punish a village labourer for neglecting church on\r\nSunday morning. We have seen how the cottagers paid in Enclosure\r\nBills for their lords’ adventures at play. They paid also for their\r\nlords’ dissipations in the loss of innocent pleasures that might have\r\nbrought some colour into their grey lives. The more boisterous the\r\nfun at Almack’s, the deeper the gloom thrown over the village. The\r\nSelect Committee on Allotments that reported in 1843 found one of the\r\nchief causes of crime in the lack of recreations. Sheridan at one time\r\nand Cobbett at another tried to revive village sports, but social\r\ncircumstances were too strong for them. In this respect the French\r\npeasant had the advantage. Babeau’s picture of his gay and sociable\r\nSunday may be overdrawn, but a comparison of Crabbe’s description\r\nof the English Sunday with contemporary descriptions of Sunday as\r\nit was spent in a French village, shows that the spirit of common\r\ngaiety, killed in England by Puritanism and by the destruction of the\r\nnatural and easy-going relations of the village community, survived\r\nin France through all the tribulations of poverty and famine. The\r\neighteenth-century French village still bore a resemblance in fact\r\nto the mediæval English village, and Goldsmith has recorded in _The\r\nTraveller_ his impressions of ‘mirth and social ease.’ Babeau gives\r\nan account of a great variety of village games, from the violent\r\ncontests in Brittany for the ‘choule,’ in one of which fourteen players\r\nwere drowned, to the gentler dances and the children’s romps that\r\nwere general in other parts of France, and Arthur Young was very much\r\nstruck by the agility and the grace that the heavy peasants displayed\r\nin dancing on the village green. Windham, speaking in a bad cause, the\r\ndefence of bull-baiting in 1800, laid stress on the contrast: ‘In the\r\nsouth of France and in Spain, at the end of the day’s labour, and in\r\nthe cool of the evening’s shade, the poor dance in mirthful festivity\r\non the green, to the sound of the guitar. But in this country no such\r\nsource of amusement presents itself. If they dance, it must be often in\r\na marsh, or in the rain, for the pleasure of catching cold. But there\r\nis a substitute in this country well known by the name of _Hops_. We\r\nall know the alarm which the very word inspires, and the sound of the\r\nfiddle calls forth the magistrate to dissolve the meeting. Men bred\r\nin ignorance of the world, and having no opportunity of mixing in its\r\nscenes or observing its manners, may be much worse employed than in\r\nlearning something of its customs from theatrical representations; but\r\nif a company of strolling players make their appearance in a village,\r\nthey are hunted immediately from it as a nuisance, except, perhaps,\r\nthere be a few people of greater wealth in the neighbourhood, whose\r\nwives and daughters patronize them.’[398] Thus all the influences of\r\nthe time conspired to isolate the poor, and the changes, destructive of\r\ntheir freedom and happiness, that were taking place in their social and\r\neconomic surroundings, were aggravated by a revival of Puritanism which\r\nhelped to rob village life of all its natural melody and colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[378] _Reflections on the Revolution in France_ (fourth edition), p.\r\n359.\r\n\r\n[379] Eden, vol. i. p. 579.\r\n\r\n[380] _Reports on Poor_, vol. ii. p. 325.\r\n\r\n[381] _Political Register_, vol. lxxviii. p. 710.\r\n\r\n[382] Hasbach, p. 131.\r\n\r\n[383] ‘Village,’ Book 1.\r\n\r\n[384] Vol. xxxviii. p. 750 ff.\r\n\r\n[385] Cobbett’s _Political Register_, March 17, 1821, p. 779.\r\n\r\n[386] Bamford, _Passages in the Life of a Radical_, p. 38.\r\n\r\n[387] _Rural Rides_, p. 460.\r\n\r\n[388] _Reflections_, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[389] _Poor Law Report_, 1817.\r\n\r\n[390] Cf. _Ibid._, 1834, p. 161.\r\n\r\n[391] Cf. case of apprentice, _Annual Register_, 1819, p. 195.\r\n\r\n[392] _Poor Law Report_, 1817; in some cases there were amicable\r\narrangements to keep down legal expenses; _e.g._ at Halifax (Eden), the\r\noverseer formed a society of the officers of adjoining parishes.

What kind of a community\r\nwas created by the Speenhamland system after it had been in force for\r\na generation? We have, fortunately, a very full picture given in a\r\nParliamentary Report that is generally regarded as one of the landmarks\r\nof English history. We cannot do better than set out the main features\r\nof the Report of the Poor Law Commissioners of 1834, and the several\r\neffects they traced to this system.\r\n\r\nThe first effect is one that everybody could have anticipated: the\r\ndestruction of all motives for effort and ambition. Under this system\r\n‘the most worthless were sure of _something_, while the prudent, the\r\nindustrious, and the sober, with all their care and pains, obtained\r\n_only something_; and even that scanty pittance was doled out to\r\nthem by the overseer.’[399] All labourers were condemned to live on\r\nthe brink of starvation, for no effort of will or character could\r\nimprove their position. The effect on the imagination was well summed\r\nup in a rhetorical question from a labourer who gave evidence to\r\na Commissioner. ‘When a man has his spirit broken what is he good\r\nfor?’[400] The Poor Law Commissioners looked at it from a different\r\npoint of view: ‘The labourer feels that the existing system, though\r\nit generally gives him low wages, always gives him work. It gives\r\nhim also, strange as it may appear, what he values more, a sort of\r\nindependence. He need not bestir himself to seek work; he need not\r\nstudy to please his master; he need not put any restraint upon his\r\ntemper; he need not ask relief as a favour. He has all a slave’s\r\nsecurity for subsistence, without his liability to punishment.... All\r\nthe other classes of society are exposed to the vicissitudes of hope\r\nand fear; he alone has nothing to lose or to gain.’[401]\r\n\r\nBut it is understating the result of the system on individual\r\nenterprise to say that it destroyed incentives to ambition; for in some\r\nparishes it actually proscribed independence and punished the labourer\r\nwho owned some small property. Wages under these conditions were so\r\nlow that a man with a little property or a few savings could not keep\r\nhimself alive without help from the parish, but if a man was convicted\r\nof possessing anything he was refused parish help. It was dangerous\r\neven to look tidy or neat, ‘ragged clothes are kept by the poor, for\r\nthe express purpose of coming to the vestry in them.’[402] The Report\r\nof the Commissioners on this subject recalls Rousseau’s description of\r\nthe French peasant with whom he stayed in the course of his travels,\r\nwho, when his suspicions had been soothed, and his hospitable instincts\r\nhad been warmed by friendly conversation, produced stores of food from\r\nthe secret place where they had been hidden to escape the eye of the\r\ntax-collector. A man who had saved anything was ruined. A Mr. Hickson,\r\na Northampton manufacturer and landowner in Kent, gave an illustration\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n‘The case of a man who has worked for me will show the effect of the\r\nparish system in preventing frugal habits. This is a hard-working,\r\nindustrious man, named William Williams. He is married, and had saved\r\nsome money, to the amount of about £70, and had two cows; he had also\r\na sow and ten pigs. He had got a cottage well furnished; he was a\r\nmember of a benefit club at Meopham, from which he received 8s. a week\r\nwhen he was ill. He was beginning to learn to read and write, and sent\r\nhis children to the Sunday School. He had a legacy of about £46, but\r\nhe got his other money together by saving from his fair wages as a\r\nwaggoner. Some circumstances occurred which obliged me to part with\r\nhim. The consequence of this labouring man having been frugal and saved\r\nmoney, and got the cows, was that no one would employ him, although\r\nhis superior character as a workman was well known in the parish. He\r\ntold me at the time I was obliged to part with him: “Whilst I have\r\nthese things I shall get no work; I must part with them all; I must be\r\nreduced to a state of beggary before any one will employ me.” I was\r\ncompelled to part with him at Michaelmas; he has not yet got work, and\r\nhe has no chance of getting any until he has become a pauper; for until\r\nthen the paupers will be preferred to him. He cannot get work in his\r\nown parish, and he will not be allowed to get any in other parishes.\r\nAnother instance of the same kind occurred amongst my workmen. Thomas\r\nHardy, the brother-in-law of the same man, was an excellent workman,\r\ndischarged under similar circumstances; he has a very industrious wife.\r\nThey have got two cows, a well-furnished cottage, and a pig and fowls.\r\nNow he cannot get work, because he has property. The pauper will be\r\npreferred to him, and he can qualify himself for it only by becoming a\r\npauper. If he attempts to get work elsewhere, he is told that they do\r\nnot want to fix him on the parish. Both these are fine young men, and\r\nas excellent labourers as I could wish to have. The latter labouring\r\nman mentioned another instance of a labouring man in another parish\r\n(Henstead), who had once had more property than he, but was obliged to\r\nconsume it all, and is now working on the roads.’[403] This effect of\r\nthe Speenhamland arrangements was dwelt on in the evidence before the\r\nCommittee on Agricultural Labourers’ Wages in 1824. Labourers had to\r\ngive up their cottages in a Dorsetshire village because they could not\r\nbecome pensioners if they possessed a cottage, and farmers would only\r\ngive employment to village pensioners. Thus these cottagers who had not\r\nbeen evicted by enclosure were evicted by the Speenhamland system.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that in the case of another man of independent\r\nnature in Cambridgeshire, who had saved money and so could get no work,\r\nwe are told that the young men pointed at him, and called him a fool\r\nfor not spending his money at the public-house, ‘adding that then he\r\nwould get work.’[404] The statesmen who condemned the labourer to this\r\nfate had rejected the proposal for a minimum wage, on the ground that\r\nit would destroy emulation.\r\n\r\nThere was one slight alleviation of this vicious system, which the\r\nPoor Law Commissioners considered in the very different light of\r\nan aggravation. If society was to be reorganised on such a basis\r\nas this, it was at any rate better that the men who were made to\r\nlive on public money should not be grateful to the ratepayers. The\r\nCommissioners were pained by the insolence of the paupers. ‘The parish\r\nmoney,’ said a Sussex labourer, ‘is now chucked to us like as to a\r\ndog,’[405] but the labourers did not lick the hand that threw it. All\r\nthrough the Report we read complaints of the ‘insolent, discontented,\r\nsurly pauper,’ who talks of ‘right’ and ‘income,’ and who will soon\r\nfight for these supposed rights and income ‘unless some step is taken\r\nto arrest his progress to open violence.’ The poor emphasised this\r\nview by the terms they applied to their rate subsidies, which they\r\nsometimes called ‘their reglars,’ sometimes ‘the county allowance,’\r\nand sometimes ‘The Act of Parliament allowance.’ Old dusty rentbooks\r\nof receipts and old dirty indentures of apprenticeship were handed\r\ndown from father to son with as much care as if they had been deeds of\r\nfreehold property, as documentary evidence to their right to a share\r\nin the rates of a particular parish.[406] Of course there was not a\r\nuniform administration, and the Commissioners reported that whilst in\r\nsome districts men were disqualified for relief if they had any wages,\r\nin others there was no inquiry into circumstances, and non-necessitous\r\npersons dipped like the rest into the till. In many cases only the\r\nwages received during the last week or fortnight were taken into\r\naccount, and thus the allowance would be paid to some persons who at\r\nparticular periods received wages in excess of the scale. This accounts\r\nfor the fact stated by Thorold Rogers from his own experience that\r\nthere were labourers who actually saved considerable sums out of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious and immediate effect was the effect which had been\r\nforeseen without misgiving in Warwickshire and Worcestershire. The\r\nmarried man was employed in preference to the bachelor, and his income\r\nrose with the birth of each child. But there was one thing better\r\nthan to marry and have a family, and that was to marry a mother of\r\nbastards, for bastards were more profitable than legitimate children,\r\nsince the parish guaranteed the contribution for which the putative\r\nfather was legally liable. It was easier to manage with a family than\r\nwith a single child. As one young woman of twenty-four with four\r\nbastard children put it, ‘If she had one more she should be very\r\ncomfortable.’[407] Women with bastard children were thus very eligible\r\nwives. The effect of the whole system on village morals was striking\r\nand widespread, and a witness from a parish which was overwhelmed\r\nwith this sudden deluge of population said to the Commission, ‘the\r\neighteen-penny children will eat up this parish in ten years more,\r\nunless some relief be afforded us.’[408] Before this period, if we are\r\nto believe Cobbett, it had been rare for a woman to be with child at\r\nthe time of her marriage; in these days of demoralisation and distress\r\nit became the habit.\r\n\r\nThe effects produced by this system on the recipients of relief were\r\nall of them such as might have been anticipated, and in this respect\r\nthe Report of the Commissioners contained no surprises. It merely\r\nillustrated the generalisations that had been made by all Poor Law\r\nReformers during the last fifteen years. But the discovery of the\r\nextent of the corruption which the system had bred in local government\r\nand administration was probably a revelation to most people. It\r\ndemoralised not only those who received but those who gave. A network\r\nof tangled interests spread over local life, and employers and\r\ntradesmen were faced with innumerable temptations and opportunities\r\nfor fraud. To take the case of the overseer first. Suppose him to be\r\na tradesman: he was liable to suffer in his custom if he refused to\r\nrelieve the friends, or it might be the workmen of his customers. It\r\nwould require a man of almost superhuman rigidity of principle to be\r\nwilling not only to lose time and money in serving a troublesome and\r\nunprofitable office, but to lose custom as well.[409] From the resolve\r\nnot to lose custom he might gradually slip down to the determination to\r\nreimburse himself for ‘the vexatious demands’ on his time, till a state\r\nof affairs like that in Slaugham came about.\r\n\r\n‘Population, 740. Expenditure, £1706. The above large sum of money is\r\nexpended principally in orders on the village shops for flour, clothes,\r\nbutter, cheese, etc.: the tradesmen serve the office of overseer by\r\nturns; the two last could neither read nor write.’[410]\r\n\r\nIf the overseer were a farmer there were temptations to pay part of\r\nthe wages of his own and his friends’ labourers out of parish money,\r\nor to supply the workhouse with his own produce. The same temptations\r\nbeset the members of vestries, whether they were open or select.\r\n‘Each vestryman, so far as he is an immediate employer of labour, is\r\ninterested in keeping down the rate of wages, and in throwing part of\r\ntheir payment on others, and, above all, on the principal object of\r\nparochial fraud, the tithe-owner: if he is the owner of cottages, he\r\nendeavours to get their rent paid by the parish; if he keeps a shop, he\r\nstruggles to get allowance for his customers or debtors; if he deals\r\nin articles used in the workhouse, he tries to increase the workhouse\r\nconsumption; if he is in humble circumstances, his own relations or\r\nfriends may be among the applicants.’[411] Mr. Drummond, a magistrate\r\nfor Hants and Surrey, said to the Committee on Labourers’ Wages in\r\n1824, that part of the poor-rate expenditure was returned to farmers\r\nand landowners in exorbitant cottage rents, and that the farmers always\r\nopposed a poor man who wished to build himself a cottage on the waste.\r\n\r\nIn the case of what was known as the ‘labour rate’ system, the members\r\nof one class combined together to impose the burden of maintaining the\r\npoor on the shoulders of the other classes. By this system, instead of\r\nthe labourer’s wages being made up to a fixed amount by the parish,\r\neach ratepayer was bound to employ, and to pay at a certain rate, a\r\ncertain number of labourers, whether he wanted them or not. The number\r\ndepended sometimes on his assessment to the poor rate, sometimes on the\r\namount of acres he occupied (of the use to which the land was put no\r\nnotice was taken, a sheep-walk counting for as much as arable fields):\r\nwhen the occupiers of land had employed a fixed number of labourers,\r\nthe surplus labourers were divided amongst all the ratepayers according\r\nto their rental. This plan was superficially fair, but as a matter of\r\nfact it worked out to the advantage of the big farmers with much arable\r\nland, and pressed hard on the small ones who cultivated their holdings\r\nby their own and their children’s labour, and, in cases where they were\r\nliable to the rate, on the tradesmen who had no employment at which\r\nto set an agricultural labourer. After 1832 (2 and 3 William IV. c.\r\n96) the agreement of three-fourths of the ratepayers to such a system\r\nwas binding on all, and the large farmers often banded together to\r\nimpose it on their fellow ratepayers by intimidation or other equally\r\nunscrupulous means: thus at Kelvedon in Essex we read: ‘There was no\r\noccasion in this parish, nor would it have been done but for a junto of\r\npowerful landholders, putting down opposition by exempting a sufficient\r\nnumber, to give themselves the means of a majority.’[412]\r\n\r\nLandlords in some cases resorted to Machiavellian tactics in order to\r\nescape their burdens.\r\n\r\n‘Several instances have been mentioned to us, of parishes nearly\r\ndepopulated, in which almost all the labour is performed by persons\r\nsettled in the neighbouring villages or towns; drawing from them, as\r\nallowance, the greater part of their subsistence.’[413] This method is\r\ndescribed more at length in the following passage:--\r\n\r\n‘When a parish is in the hands of only one proprietor, or of\r\nproprietors so few in number as to be able to act, and to compel their\r\ntenants to act, in unison, and adjoins to parishes in which property is\r\nmuch divided, they may pull down every cottage as it becomes vacant,\r\nand prevent the building of new ones. By a small immediate outlay\r\nthey may enable and induce a considerable portion of those who have\r\nsettlements in their parish to obtain settlements in the adjoining\r\nparishes: by hiring their labourers for periods less than a year, they\r\nmay prevent the acquisition of new settlements in their own. They may\r\nthus depopulate their own estates, and cultivate them by means of the\r\nsurplus population of the surrounding district.’[414] A clergyman in\r\nReading[415] said that he had between ten and twenty families living in\r\nhis parish and working for the farmers in their original parish, whose\r\ncottages had been pulled down over their heads. Occasionally a big\r\nproprietor of parish A, in order to lessen the poor rates, would, with\r\nunscrupulous ingenuity, take a farm in parish B, and there hire for the\r\nyear a batch of labourers from A: these at the end of their term he\r\nwould turn off on to the mercies of parish B which was now responsible\r\nfor them, whilst he sent for a fresh consignment from parish A.[416]\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Commission is a remarkable and searching picture\r\nof the general demoralisation produced by the Speenhamland system,\r\nand from that point of view it is most graphic and instructive. But\r\nnobody who has followed the history of the agricultural labourer can\r\nfail to be struck by its capital omission. The Commissioners, in their\r\nsimple analysis of that system, could not take their eyes off the\r\nSpeenhamland goblin, and instead of dealing with that system as a wrong\r\nand disastrous answer to certain difficult questions, they treated the\r\nsystem itself as the one and original source of all evils. They sighed\r\nfor the days when ‘the paupers were a small disreputable minority,\r\nwhose resentment was not to be feared, and whose favour was of no\r\nvalue,’ and ‘all other classes were anxious to diminish the number of\r\napplicants, and to reduce the expenses of their maintenance.’[417] They\r\ndid not realise that the governing class had not created a Frankenstein\r\nmonster for the mere pleasure of its creation; that they had not set\r\nout to draw up an ideal constitution, as Rousseau had done for the\r\nPoles. In 1795 there was a fear of revolution, and the upper classes\r\nthrew the Speenhamland system over the villages as a wet blanket\r\nover sparks. The Commissioners merely isolated the consequences of\r\nSpeenhamland and treated them as if they were the entire problem, and\r\nconsequently, though their report served to extinguish that system, it\r\ndid nothing to rehabilitate the position of the labourer, or to restore\r\nthe rights and status he had lost. The new Poor Law was the only gift\r\nof the Reformed Parliament to the agricultural labourer; it was an\r\nimprovement on the old, but only in the sense that the east wind is\r\nbetter than the sirocco.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat would have happened if either of the other two remedies had been\r\nadopted for the problem to which the Speenhamland system was applied,\r\nit is impossible to say. But it is easy to see that the position of\r\nthe agricultural labourer, which could not have been worse, might have\r\nbeen very much better, and that the nation, as apart from the landlords\r\nand money-lords, would have come out of this whirlpool much stronger\r\nand much richer. This was clear to one correspondent of the Poor Law\r\nCommission, whose memorandum, printed in an Appendix,[418] is more\r\ninteresting and profound than any contribution to the subject made by\r\nthe Commissioners themselves. M. Chateauvieux set out an alternative\r\npolicy to Speenhamland, which, if the governing class of 1795 or the\r\ngoverning class of 1834 had been enlightened enough to follow it, would\r\nhave set up a very different labouring class in the villages from the\r\nhelpless proletariat that was created by the enclosures.\r\n\r\n‘Mais si au lieu d’opérer le partage des biens communaux,\r\nl’administration de la commune s’était bornée à louer pour quelques\r\nannées des parcelles des terres qu’elle possède en vaine pâture, et\r\ncela à très bas prix, aux journaliers domiciliés sur son territoire, il\r\nen serait resulté:\r\n\r\n ‘(1) Que le capital de ces terres n’aurait point été aliéné et absorbé\r\n dans la propriété particulière.\r\n\r\n ‘(2) Que ce capital aurait été néanmoins utilisé pour la reproduction.\r\n\r\n ‘(3) Qu’il aurait servi à l’amélioration du sort des pauvres qui\r\n l’auraient défriché, de toute la différence entre le prix du loyer\r\n qu’ils en auraient payé, et le montant du revenu qu’ils auraient\r\n obtenu de sa recolte.\r\n\r\n ‘(4) Que la commune aurait encaissé le montant de ses loyers, et\r\n aurait augmenté d’autant les moyens dont elle dispose pour le\r\n soulagement de ces pauvres.’\r\n\r\nM. Chateauvieux understood better than any of the Commissioners,\r\ndominated as they were by the extreme individualist economy of the\r\ntime, the meaning of Bolingbroke’s maxim that a wise minister considers\r\nhis administration as a single day in the great year of Government; but\r\nas a day that is affected by those which went before and must affect\r\nthose which are to come after. A Government of enclosing landowners\r\nwas perhaps not to be expected to understand all that the State was in\r\ndanger of losing in the reckless alienation of common property.\r\n\r\nWhat of the prospects of the other remedy that was proposed? At first\r\nsight it seems natural to argue that had Whitbread’s Minimum Wage Bill\r\nbecome an Act of Parliament it would have remained a dead letter.\r\nThe administration depended on the magistrates and the magistrates\r\nrepresented the rent-receiving and employing classes. A closer scrutiny\r\nwarrants a different conclusion. At the time that the Speenhamland\r\nplan was adopted there were many magistrates in favour of setting a\r\nminimum scale. The Suffolk magistrates, for example, put pressure on\r\nthe county members to vote for Whitbread’s Bill, and those members,\r\ntogether with Grey and Sheridan, were its backers. The Parliamentary\r\nsupport for the Bill was enough to show that it was not only in Suffolk\r\nthat it would have been adopted; there were men like Lechmere and\r\nWhitbread scattered about the country, and though they were men of far\r\nmore enlightened views than the average J.P., they were not without\r\ninfluence in their own neighbourhoods. It is pretty certain, therefore,\r\nthat if the Bill had been carried, it would have been administered in\r\nsome parts of the country. The public opinion in support of the Act\r\nwould have been powerfully reinforced by the pressure of the labourers,\r\nand this would have meant a more considerable stimulus than might at\r\nfirst be supposed, for the Report of the Poor Law Commissioners shows\r\nthat the pressure of the labourers was a very important factor in the\r\nretention of the allowance system in parishes where the overseers\r\nwished to abandon it, and if the labourers could coerce the local\r\nauthorities into continuing the Speenhamland system, they could have\r\ncoerced the magistrates into making an assessment of wages. The\r\nlabourers were able by a show of violence to raise wages and to reduce\r\nprices temporarily, as is clear from the history of 1816 and 1830.\r\nIt is not too much to suppose that they could have exercised enough\r\ninfluence in 1795 to induce magistrates in many places to carry out a\r\nlaw that was on the Statute Book. Further, it is not unreasonable to\r\nsuppose that agricultural labourers’ unions to enforce the execution of\r\nthe law would have escaped the monstrous Combination Law of 1799 and\r\n1800, for even in 1808 the Glasgow and Lancashire cotton-weavers were\r\npermitted openly to combine for the purpose of seeking a legal fixing\r\nof wages.[419]\r\n\r\nIf assessment had once become the practice, the real struggle would\r\nhave arisen when the great prosperity of agriculture began to decline;\r\nat the time, that is, when the Speenhamland system began to show those\r\nsymptoms of strain that we have described. Would the customary wage,\r\nestablished under the more favourable conditions of 1795, have stood\r\nagainst that pressure? Would the labourers have been able to keep up\r\nwages, as critics of the Whitbread Bill had feared that they would?\r\nIn considering the answers to that question, we have to reckon with\r\na force that the debaters of 1795 could not have foreseen. In 1795\r\nCobbett was engaged in the politics and polemics of America, and if\r\nany member of the House of Commons knew his name, he knew it as the\r\nname of a fierce champion of English institutions, and a fierce enemy\r\nof revolutionary ideas; a hero of the _Anti-Jacobin_ itself. In 1810\r\nCobbett was rapidly making himself the most powerful tribune that\r\nthe English poor have ever known. Cobbett’s faults are plain enough,\r\nfor they are all on the surface. His egotism sometimes seduced his\r\njudgment; he had a strongly perverse element in his nature; his opinion\r\nof any proposals not his own was apt to be petulant and peevish, and\r\nit might perhaps be said of him that he generally had a wasp in his\r\nbonnet. These qualities earned for him his title of the Contentious\r\nMan. They would have been seriously disabling in a Cabinet Minister,\r\nbut they did not affect his power of collecting and mobilising and\r\nleading the spasmodic forces of the poor.\r\n\r\nLet us recall his career in order to understand what his influence\r\nwould have been if the labourers had won their customary wage in 1795,\r\nand had been fighting to maintain it fifteen or twenty years later.\r\nHis adventures began early. When he was thirteen his imagination\r\nwas fired by stories the gardener at Farnham told him of the glories\r\nof Kew. He ran away from home, and made so good an impression on the\r\nKew gardener that he was given work there. His last coppers on that\r\njourney were spent in buying Swift’s _Tale of a Tub_. He returned home,\r\nbut his restless dreams drove him again into the world. He tried to\r\nbecome a sailor, and ultimately became a soldier. He left the army,\r\nwhere he had made his mark and received rapid promotion, in order to\r\nexpose a financial scandal in his regiment, but on discovering that\r\nthe interests involved in the countenance of military abuses were\r\nfar more powerful than he had supposed, he abandoned his attempt and\r\nfled to France. A few months later he crossed to America, and settled\r\ndown to earn a living by teaching English to French refugees. This\r\npeaceful occupation he relinquished for the congenial excitements\r\nof polemical journalism, and he was soon the fiercest pamphleteer\r\non the side of the Federals, who took the part of England, in their\r\ncontroversies with the Democrats, who took the part of the Revolution.\r\nSo far as the warfare of pamphlets went, Cobbett turned the scale. The\r\nDemocrats could not match his wit, his sarcasm, his graphic and pointed\r\ninvectives, his power of clever and sparkling analysis and ridicule.\r\nThis warfare occupied him for nearly ten years, and he returned to\r\nEngland in time to have his windows broken for refusing to illuminate\r\nhis house in celebration of the Peace of Amiens. In 1802 he started the\r\n_Political Register_. At that time he was still a Tory, but a closer\r\nstudy of English life changed his opinions, and four years later he\r\nthrew himself into the Radical movement. The effect of his descent on\r\nEnglish politics can only be compared to the shock that was given to\r\nthe mind of Italy by the French methods of warfare, when Charles VIII.\r\nled his armies into her plains to fight pitched battles without any\r\nof the etiquette or polite conventions that had graced the combats of\r\nthe condottieri. He gave to the Reform agitation an uncompromising\r\nreality and daring, and a movement which had become the dying echo of\r\na smothered struggle broke into storm and thunder. Hazlitt scarcely\r\nexaggerated his dæmonic powers when he said of him that he formed a\r\nfourth estate of himself.\r\n\r\nNow Cobbett may be said to have spent twenty years of his life in the\r\neffort to save the labourers from degradation and ruin. He was the only\r\nman of his generation who regarded politics from this standpoint. This\r\nmotive is the key to his career. He saw in 1816 that the nation had to\r\nchoose between its sinecures, its extravagant army, its rulers’ mad\r\nscheme of borrowing at a higher rate to extinguish debt, for which it\r\nwas paying interest at a low rate, its huge Civil List and privileged\r\nestablishments, the interests of the fund-holders and contractors\r\non the one hand, and its labourers on the other. In that conflict\r\nof forces the labourer could not hold his own. Later, Cobbett saw\r\nthat there were other interests, the interests of landowners and of\r\ntithe-holders, which the State would have to subordinate to national\r\nclaims if the labourer was to be saved. In that conflict, too, the\r\nlabourer was beaten. He was unrepresented in Parliament, whereas the\r\nopposing interests were massed there. Cobbett wanted Parliamentary\r\nReform, not like the traditional Radicals as a philosophy of rights,\r\nbut as an avalanche of social power. Parliamentary Reform was never\r\nan end to him, nor the means to anything short of the emancipation of\r\nthe labourer. In this, his main mission, Cobbett failed. The upper\r\nclasses winced under his ruthless manners, and they trembled before\r\nhis Berserker rage, but it is the sad truth of English history that\r\nthey beat him. Now if, instead of throwing himself against this world\r\nof privilege and vested interests in the hopes of wringing a pittance\r\nof justice for a sinking class, it had been his task to maintain a\r\nposition already held, he would have fought under very different\r\nconditions. If, when prices began to fall, there had been a customary\r\nwage in most English villages, the question would not have been whether\r\nthe ruling class was to maintain its privileges and surplus profits by\r\nletting the labourer sink deeper into the morass, but whether it was\r\nto maintain these privileges and profits by taking something openly\r\nfrom him. It is easier to prevent a dog from stealing a bone than\r\nto take the bone out of his mouth. Cobbett was not strong enough to\r\nbreak the power of the governing class, but he might have been strong\r\nenough to defend the customary rights of the labouring class. As it\r\nwas, the governing class was on the defensive at every point. The\r\nrent receivers, the tithe owners, the mortgagers, the lenders to the\r\nGovernment and the contractors all clung to their gains, and the food\r\nallowance of the labourer slowly and steadily declined.\r\n\r\nThere was this great difference between the Speenhamland system and\r\na fixed standard of wages. The Speenhamland system after 1812 was\r\nnot applied so as to maintain an equilibrium between the income and\r\nexpenditure of the labourer: it was applied to maintain an equilibrium\r\nbetween social forces. The scale fell not with the fall of prices to\r\nthe labourer, but with the fall of profits to the possessing classes.\r\nThe minimum was not the minimum on which the labourer could live, but\r\nthe minimum below which rebellion was certain. This was the way in\r\nwhich wages found their own level. They gravitated lower and lower\r\nwith the growing weakness of the wage-earner. If Cobbett had been at\r\nthe head of a movement for preserving to the labourer a right bestowed\r\non him by Act of Parliament, either he would have succeeded, or the\r\ndisease would have come to a crisis in 1816, instead of taking the form\r\nof a lingering and wasting illness. Either, that is, other classes\r\nwould have had to make the economies necessary to keep the labourers’\r\nwages at the customary point, or the labourers would have made their\r\nlast throw before they had been desolated and weakened by another\r\nfifteen years of famine.\r\n\r\nThere is another respect in which the minimum wage policy would have\r\nprofoundly altered the character of village society. It would have\r\ngiven the village labourers a bond of union before they had lost the\r\nmemories and the habits of their more independent life; it would have\r\nmade them an organised force, something like the organised forces that\r\nhave built up a standard of life for industrial workmen. An important\r\npassage in Fielding’s _Tom Jones_ shows that there was material for\r\nsuch combination in the commoners of the old village. Fielding is\r\ntalking of his borrowings from the classics and he defends himself\r\nwith this analogy: ‘The ancients may be considered as a rich common,\r\nwhere every person who hath the smallest tenement in Parnassus hath\r\na free right to batten his muse: or, to place it in a clearer light,\r\nwe moderns are to the ancients what the poor are to the rich. By the\r\npoor here I mean that large and venerable body which in English we\r\ncall the mob. Now whoever hath had the honour to be admitted to any\r\ndegree of intimacy with this mob must well know, that it is one of\r\ntheir established maxims to plunder and pillage their rich neighbours\r\nwithout any reluctance: and that this is held to be neither sin nor\r\ncrime among them. And so constantly do they abide and act by this\r\nmaxim, that in every parish almost in the kingdom there is a kind of\r\nconfederacy ever carrying on against a certain person of opulence\r\ncalled the squire whose property is considered as free booty by all\r\nhis poor neighbours; who, as they conclude that there is no manner\r\nof guilt in such depredations, look upon it as a point of honour and\r\nmoral obligation to conceal and to preserve each other from punishment\r\non all such occasions. In like manner are the ancients such as Homer,\r\nVirgil, Horace, Cicero and the rest to be esteemed among us writers as\r\nso many wealthy squires from whom we, the poor of Parnassus, claim an\r\nimmemorial custom of taking whatever we can come at.’[420]\r\n\r\nIt would not have been possible to create a great labourers’ union\r\nbefore the Combination Laws were repealed in 1824, but if the labourers\r\nhad been organised to defend their standard wage, they would have\r\nestablished a tradition of permanent association in each village. The\r\nwant of this was their fatal weakness. All the circumstances make the\r\nspirit of combination falter in the country. In towns men are face to\r\nface with the brutal realities of their lives, unsoftened by any of\r\nthe assuaging influences of brook and glade and valley. Men and women\r\nwho work in the fields breathe something of the resignation and peace\r\nof Nature; they bear trouble and wrong with a dangerous patience.\r\nDiscontent moves, but it moves slowly, and whereas storms blow up in\r\nthe towns, they beat up in the country. That is one reason why the\r\nhistory of the anguish of the English agricultural labourer so rarely\r\nbreaks into violence. Castlereagh’s Select Committee in 1817 rejoiced\r\nin the discovery that ‘notwithstanding the alarming progress which has\r\nbeen made in extending disaffection, its success has been confined\r\nto the principal manufacturing districts, and that scarcely any of\r\nthe agricultural population have lent themselves to these violent\r\nprojects.’ There is a Russian saying that the peasant must ‘be boiled\r\nin the factory pot’ before a revolution can succeed. And if it is\r\ndifficult in the nature of things to make rural labourers as formidable\r\nto their masters as industrial workers, there is another reason why\r\nthe English labourer rebelled so reluctantly and so tardily against\r\nwhat Sir Spencer Walpole called, in the true spirit of a classical\r\npolitician, ‘his inevitable and hereditary lot.’ Village society was\r\nconstantly losing its best and bravest blood. Bamford’s description\r\nof the poacher who nearly killed a gamekeeper’s understrapper in a\r\nquarrel in a public-house, and then hearing from Dr. Healey that\r\nhis man was only stunned, promised the doctor that if there was but\r\none single hare on Lord Suffield’s estates, that hare should be in\r\nthe doctor’s stew-pot next Sunday, reminds us of the loss a village\r\nsuffered when its poachers were snapped up by a game-preserving bench,\r\nand tossed to the other side of the world. During the years between\r\nWaterloo and the Reform Bill the governing class was decimating the\r\nvillage populations on the principle of the Greek tyrant who flicked\r\noff the heads of the tallest blades in his field; the Game Laws,\r\nsummary jurisdiction, special commissions, drove men of spirit and\r\nenterprise, the natural leaders of their fellows, from the villages\r\nwhere they might have troubled the peace of their masters. The village\r\nHampdens of that generation sleep on the shores of Botany Bay. Those\r\nwho blame the supine character of the English labourer forget that his\r\nrace, before it had quite lost the memories and the habits of the days\r\nof its independence and its share in the commons, was passed through\r\nthis sieve. The scenes we shall describe in the next chapter show that\r\nthe labourers were capable of great mutual fidelity when once they\r\nwere driven into rebellion. If they had had a right to defend and a\r\ncomradeship to foster from the first, Cobbett, who spent his superb\r\nstrength in a magnificent onslaught on the governing class, might have\r\nmade of the race whose wrongs he pitied as his own, an army no less\r\nresolute and disciplined than the army O’Connell made of the broken\r\npeasants of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[399] Report of the Poor Law Commission, 1834, p. 243.\r\n\r\n[400] _Ibid._, p. 84.\r\n\r\n[401] _Ibid._, pp. 56-7.\r\n\r\n[402] Report of the Poor Law Commission, 1834, p. 244.\r\n\r\n[403] Report of the Poor Law Commission, 1834, pp. 78-9.\r\n\r\n[404] _Ibid._, p. 80.\r\n\r\n[405] _Ibid._, p. 291.\r\n\r\n[406] Report of the Poor Law Commission, 1834, p. 94.\r\n\r\n[407] _Ibid._, p. 172.\r\n\r\n[408] _Ibid._, p. 66.\r\n\r\n[409] Report of the Poor Law Commission, 1834, pp. 98-104.\r\n\r\n[410] _Ibid._, p. 100.\r\n\r\n[411] Report of the Poor Law Commission, 1834, p. 108.\r\n\r\n[412] _Ibid._, p. 210.\r\n\r\n[413] Report of the Poor Law Commission, 1834, p. 73.\r\n\r\n[414] _Ibid._, p. 157.\r\n\r\n[415] _Ibid._, p. 158.\r\n\r\n[416] _Ibid._, p. 161.\r\n\r\n[417] _Ibid._, p. 130.\r\n\r\n[418] Appendix F, No. 3, to 1st Report of Commissioners.\r\n\r\n[419] See Webb’s _History of Trade Unionism_, p. 59.\r\n\r\n[420] _Tom Jones_, Bk. XII. chap. i.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE LAST LABOURERS’ REVOLT\r\n\r\n Where not otherwise stated the authorities for the two following\r\n chapters are the Home Office Papers for the time (Municipal and\r\n Provincial, Criminal, Disturbances, Domestic, etc.), the _Times_ and\r\n local papers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nA traveller who wished to compare the condition of the English and the\r\nFrench rural populations in 1830 would have had little else to do than\r\nto invert all that had been written on the subject by travellers a\r\ncentury earlier. At the beginning of the eighteenth century England had\r\nthe prosperous and France the miserable peasantry. But by the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century the French peasant had been set free from\r\nthe impoverishing and degrading services which had made his lot so\r\nintolerable in the eyes of foreign observers; he cultivated his own\r\nland, and lived a life, spare, arduous, and exacting but independent.\r\nThe work of the Revolution had been done so thoroughly in this respect\r\nthat the Bourbons, when Wellington and the allies lifted them back on\r\nto their throne, could not undo it. It is true that the future of the\r\nFrench peasants was a subject of some anxiety to English observers,\r\nand that M‘Culloch committed himself to the prediction that in half\r\na century, owing to her mass of small owners, France would be the\r\ngreatest pauper-warren in Europe. If any French peasant was disturbed\r\nby this nightmare of the political economy of the time, he had the grim\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that his position could hardly become worse\r\nthan the position that the English labourer already occupied. He would\r\nhave based his conclusion, not on the wild language of revolutionaries,\r\nbut on the considered statement of those who were so far from\r\nmeditating revolution that they shrank even from a moderate reform of\r\nParliament. Lord Carnarvon said in one House of Parliament that the\r\nEnglish labourer had been reduced to a plight more abject than that of\r\nany race in Europe; English landlords reproduced in the other that\r\nvery parallel between the English labourer and the West Indian negro\r\nwhich had figured so conspicuously in Thelwall’s lectures. Thelwall, as\r\nCanning reminded him in a savage parody on the Benedicite, got pelted\r\nfor his pains. Since the days of those lectures all Europe had been\r\noverrun by war, and England alone had escaped what Pitt had called\r\nthe liquid fire of Jacobinism. There had followed for England fifteen\r\nyears of healing peace. Yet at the end of all this time the conquerors\r\nof Napoleon found themselves in a position which they would have done\r\nwell to exchange with the position of his victims. The German peasant\r\nhad been rescued from serfdom; Spain and Italy had at least known a\r\nbrief spell of less unequal government. The English labourer alone was\r\nthe poorer; poorer in money, poorer in happiness, poorer in sympathy,\r\nand infinitely poorer in horizon and in hope. The riches that he had\r\nbeen promised by the champions of enclosure had faded into something\r\nless than a maintenance. The wages he received without land had a lower\r\npurchasing power than the wages he had received in the days when his\r\nwages were supplemented by common rights. The standard of living which\r\nwas prescribed for him by the governing class was now much lower than\r\nit had been in 1795.\r\n\r\nThis was not part of a general decline. Other classes for whom the\r\nrulers of England prescribed the standard had advanced during the\r\nyears in which the labourers had lost ground. The King’s Civil List\r\nhad been revised when provisions rose. The salaries of the judges\r\nhad been raised by three several Acts of Parliament (1799, 1809, and\r\n1825), a similar course had been taken in the case of officials. Those\r\nwho have a taste for the finished and unconscious cynicism of this\r\nage will note--recollecting that the upper classes refused to raise\r\nwages in 1795 to meet the extra cost of living, on the ground that it\r\nwould be difficult afterwards to reduce them--that all the upper-class\r\nofficials, whose salaries were increased because living was more\r\nexpensive, were left to the permanent enjoyment of that increase. The\r\nlives of the judges, the landlords, the parsons, and the rest of the\r\ngoverning class were not become more meagre but more spacious in the\r\nlast fifty years. During that period many of the great palaces of the\r\nEnglish nobility had been built, noble libraries had been collected,\r\nand famous galleries had grown up, wing upon wing. The agricultural\r\nlabourers whose fathers had eaten meat, bacon, cheese, and vegetables\r\nwere living on bread and potatoes. They had lost their gardens, they\r\nhad ceased to brew their beer in their cottages. In their work they\r\nhad no sense of ownership or interest. They no longer ‘sauntered after\r\ncattle’ on the open common, and at twilight they no longer ‘played\r\ndown the setting sun’; the games had almost disappeared from the\r\nEnglish village, their wives and children were starving before their\r\neyes, their homes were more squalid, and the philosophy of the hour\r\ntaught the upper classes that to mend a window or to put in a brick\r\nto shield the cottage from damp or wind was to increase the ultimate\r\nmiseries of the poor. The sense of sympathy and comradeship, which\r\nhad been mixed with rude and unskilful government, in the old village\r\nhad been destroyed in the bitter days of want and distress. Degrading\r\nand repulsive work was invented for those whom the farmer would not\r\nor could not employ. De Quincey, wishing to illustrate the manners of\r\neighteenth-century France, used to quote M. Simond’s story of how he\r\nhad seen, not very long before the Revolution, a peasant ploughing with\r\na team consisting of a donkey and a woman. The English poor could have\r\ntold him that half a century later there were English villages in which\r\nit was the practice of the overseer to harness men and women to the\r\nparish cart, and that the sight of an idiot woman between the shafts\r\nwas not unknown within a hundred miles of London.[421] Men and women\r\nwere living on roots and sorrel; in the summer of the year 1830 four\r\nharvest labourers were found under a hedge dead of starvation, and Lord\r\nWinchilsea, who mentioned the fact in the House of Lords, said that\r\nthis was not an exceptional case. The labourer was worse fed and worse\r\nhoused than the prisoner, and he would not have been able to keep body\r\nand soul together if he had not found in poaching or in thieving or in\r\nsmuggling the means of eking out his doles and wages.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of this sinking class, the anger, dismay, and despair with\r\nwhich it watched the going out of all the warm comfort and light of\r\nlife, scarcely stir the surface of history. The upper classes have told\r\nus what the poor ought to have thought of these vicissitudes; religion,\r\nphilosophy, and political economy were ready with alleviations and\r\nexplanations which seemed singularly helpful and convincing to the\r\nrich. The voice of the poor themselves does not come to our ears. This\r\ngreat population seems to resemble nature, and to bear all the storms\r\nthat beat upon it with a strange silence and resignation. But just\r\nas nature has her power of protest in some sudden upheaval, so this\r\nworld of men and women--an underground world as we trace the distance\r\nthat its voices have to travel to reach us--has a volcanic character\r\nof its own, and it is only by some volcanic surprise that it can speak\r\nthe language of remonstrance or menace or prayer, or place on record\r\nits consciousness of wrong. This world has no member of Parliament,\r\nno press, it does not make literature or write history; no diary or\r\nmemoirs have kept alive for us the thoughts and cares of the passing\r\nday. It is for this reason that the events of the winter of 1830 have\r\nso profound an interest, for in the scenes now to be described we have\r\nthe mind of this class hidden from us through all this period of pain,\r\nbursting the silence by the only power at its command. The demands\r\npresented to the farmer, the parson, and the squire this winter tell us\r\nas much about the South of England labourer in 1830 as the cahiers tell\r\nus of the French peasants in 1789.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in 1795 and in 1816 there had been serious\r\ndisturbances in different parts of England. These had been suppressed\r\nwith a firm hand, but during hard winters sporadic violence and blazing\r\nhay-stacks showed from time to time that the fire was still alive under\r\nthe ashes. The rising of 1830 was far more general and more serious;\r\nseveral counties in the south of England were in state bordering on\r\ninsurrection; London was in a panic, and to some at least of those who\r\nhad tried to forget the price that had been paid for the splendour of\r\nthe rich, the message of red skies and broken mills and mob diplomacy\r\nand villages in arms sounded like the summons that came to Hernani.\r\nThe terror of the landowners during those weeks is reflected in such\r\nlanguage as that of the Duke of Buckingham, who talked of the country\r\nbeing in the hands of the rebels, or of one of the Barings, who said\r\nin the House of Commons that if the disorders went on for three or\r\nfour days longer they would be beyond the reach of almost any power to\r\ncontrol them. This chapter of social history has been overshadowed by\r\nthe riots that followed the rejection of the Reform Bill. Every one\r\nknows about the destruction of the Mansion House at Bristol, and the\r\nburning of Nottingham Castle; few know of the destruction of the hated\r\nworkhouses at Selborne and Headley. The riots at Nottingham and Bristol\r\nwere a prelude to victory; they were the wild shout of power. If the\r\nrising of 1830 had succeeded, and won back for the labourer his lost\r\nlivelihood, the day when the Headley workhouse was thrown down would be\r\nremembered by the poor as the day of the taking of the Bastille. But\r\nthis rebellion failed, and the men who led that last struggle for the\r\nlabourer passed into the forgetfulness of death and exile.\r\n\r\nKent was the scene of the first disturbances. There had been some\r\nalarming fires in the west of the county during the summer, at\r\nOrpington and near Sevenoaks. In one case the victim had made himself\r\nunpopular by pulling down a cottage built on a common adjoining his\r\nproperty, and turning out the occupants. How far these fires were\r\nconnected with later events it is impossible to say: the authors were\r\nnever discovered. The first riot occurred at Hardres on Sunday the\r\n29th of August, when four hundred labourers destroyed some threshing\r\nmachines.[422] Next day two magistrates with a hundred special\r\nconstables and some soldiers went to Hardres Court, and no more was\r\nheard of the rioters. The _Spectator_ early next year announced that it\r\nhad found as a result of inquiries that the riots began with a dispute\r\nbetween farmers over a threshing machine, in the course of which a\r\nmagistrate had expressed strong views against the introduction of these\r\nmachines. The labourers proceeded to destroy the machine, whereupon,\r\nto their surprise, the magistrate turned on them and punished them; in\r\nrevenge they fired his ricks. ‘A farmer in another village, talking of\r\nthe distress of the labourers, said, “Ah, I should be well pleased if\r\na plague were to break out among them, and then I should have their\r\ncarcases as manure, and right good stuff it would make for my hops.”\r\nThis speech, which was perhaps only intended as a brutal jest, was\r\nreported; it excited rage instead of mirth, and the stacks of the\r\njester were soon in a blaze. This act of incendiarism was open and\r\ndeliberate. The incendiary is known, and not only has he not been\r\ntried, he has not even been charged.’[423] Cobbett, on the other hand,\r\nmaintained that the occasion of the first riots was the importation\r\nof Irish labourers, a practice now some years old, that might well\r\ninflame resentment, at a time when the governing class was continually\r\ncontending that the sole cause of distress was excessive population,\r\nand that the true solution was the removal of surplus labourers to the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nWhatever the actual origin of the first outbreak may have been,\r\nthe destruction of machinery was to be a prominent feature of this\r\nsocial war. This was not merely an instinct of violence, there was\r\nmethod and reason in it. Threshing was one of the few kinds of work\r\nleft that provided the labourer with a means of existence above\r\nstarvation level. A landowner and occupier near Canterbury wrote to\r\nthe _Kent Herald_,[424] that in his parish, where no machines had been\r\nintroduced, there were twenty-three barns. He calculated that in these\r\nbarns fifteen men at least would find employment threshing corn up till\r\nMay. If we suppose that each man had a wife and three children, this\r\nemployment would affect seventy-five persons. ‘An industrious man who\r\nhas a barn never requires poor relief; he can earn from 15s. to 20s.\r\nper week; he considers it almost as his little freehold, and that in\r\neffect it certainly is.’ It is easy to imagine what the sight of one\r\nof these hated engines meant to such a parish; the fifteen men, their\r\nwives and families would have found cold comfort, when they had become\r\nsubmerged in the morass of parish relief, in the reflection that the\r\nnew machine extracted for their master’s and the public benefit ten\r\nper cent. more corn than they could hammer out by their free arms.\r\nThe destruction of threshing machines by bands of men in the district\r\nround Canterbury continued through September practically unchecked.\r\nBy the end of the month three of the most active rioters were in\r\ncustody, and the magistrates were under the pleasant illusion that\r\nthere would be voluntary surrenders. In this they were disappointed,\r\nand the disturbances spread over a wider area, which embraced the\r\nDover district. Early in October there was a riot at Lyminge, at which\r\nSir Edward Knatchbull and the Rev. Mr. Price succeeded in arresting\r\nthe ringleaders, and bound over about fifty other persons. Sir Edward\r\nKnatchbull, in writing to the Home Office, stated that the labourers\r\nsaid ‘they would rather do anything than encounter such a winter as the\r\nlast.’ Mr. Price had to pay the penalty for his active part in this\r\naffair, and his ricks were fired.\r\n\r\nLarge rewards were promised from the first to informers, these rewards\r\nincluding a wise offer of establishment elsewhere, but the prize was\r\nrefused, and rick-burning spread steadily through a second month.\r\nThreatening letters signed ‘Swing,’ a mysterious name that for the next\r\nfew weeks spread terror over England, were received by many farmers and\r\nlandowners. The machine-breakers were reported not to take money or\r\nplunder, and to refuse it if offered. Their programme was extensive and\r\nformidable. When the High Sheriff attended one of their meetings to\r\nremonstrate with them, they listened to his homily with attention, but\r\nbefore dispersing one of them said, ‘We will destroy the cornstacks and\r\nthreshing machines this year, next year we will have a turn with the\r\nparsons, and the third we will make war upon the statesmen.’[425]\r\n\r\nOn 24th October seven prisoners were tried at the East Kent Quarter\r\nSessions, for machine-breaking. They pleaded guilty, and were let off\r\nwith a lenient sentence of three days’ imprisonment and an harangue\r\nfrom Sir Edward Knatchbull. Hitherto all attempts to discover the\r\nincendiaries had been baffled, but on 21st October a zealous magistrate\r\nwrote to the Home Office to say that he had found a clue. He had\r\napprehended a man called Charles Blow, and since the evidence was not\r\nsufficient to warrant committal for arson, he had sent him to Lewes\r\nJail as a vagrant for three months. ‘In company with Blow was a girl\r\nof about ten years of age (of the name of Mary Ann Johnson), but of\r\nintelligence and cunning far beyond her age. It having been stated to\r\nme that she had let fall some expressions which went to show that she\r\ncould if she pleased communicate important information, I committed\r\nher also for the same period as Blow.’ Now the fires in question had\r\ntaken place in Kent, and the vagrants were apprehended in Sussex,\r\nconsequently the officials of both counties meddled with the matter and\r\nbetween them spoilt the whole plan, for Mary Ann and her companion were\r\nquestioned by so many different persons that they were put on their\r\nguard, and failed to give the information that was expected. Thus at\r\nany rate, Lord Camden, the Lord-Lieutenant, explained their silence,\r\nbut he did not despair, ‘if the Parties cannot even be convicted I am\r\napt to think their Committal now will do good, though they may be to\r\nbe liberated afterwards, but nothing is so likely to produce alarm and\r\nproduce evidence as a Committal for a Capital Crime.’ However, as no\r\nmore is heard of Mary Ann, it may be assumed that when she had served\r\nher three months she left Lewes Jail a sadder and a wiser child.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October, after something of a lull in the middle\r\nof the month, the situation became more serious. Dissatisfaction,\r\nor, as some called it, ‘frightful anarchy,’ spread to the Maidstone\r\nand Sittingbourne districts. Sir Robert Peel was anxious to take\r\nstrong measures. ‘I beg to repeat to you that I will adopt any\r\nmeasure--will incur any expense at the public charge--that can\r\npromote the suppression of the outrages in Kent and the detection\r\nof the offenders.’ A troop of cavalry was sent to Sittingbourne. In\r\nthe last days of October, mobs scoured the country round Maidstone,\r\ndemanding half a crown a day wages and constant employment, forcing\r\nall labourers to join them, and levying money, beer, and provisions.\r\nAt Stockbury, between Maidstone and Sittingbourne, one of these mobs\r\nparaded a tricolour and a black flag. On 30th October the Maidstone\r\nmagistrates went out with a body of thirty-four soldiers to meet a mob\r\nof four hundred people, about four miles from Maidstone, and laid hold\r\nof the three ringleaders. The arrests were made without difficulty or\r\nresistance, from which it looks as if these bands of men were not very\r\nformidable, but the officer in command of the soldiers laid stress\r\nin his confidential report on the dangers of the situation and the\r\nnecessity for fieldpieces, and Peel promptly ordered two pieces of\r\nartillery to be dispatched.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of November disturbances broke out in Sussex, and\r\nthe movement developed into an organised demand for a living wage. By\r\nthe middle of the month the labourers were masters over almost all\r\nthe triangle on the map, of which Maidstone is the apex and Hythe\r\nand Brighton are the bases. The movement, which was more systematic,\r\nthorough, and successful in this part of the country than anywhere\r\nelse, is thus described by the special correspondent of the _Times_,\r\n17th November: ‘Divested of its objectionable character, as a dangerous\r\nprecedent, the conduct of the peasantry has been admirable. There is no\r\nground for concluding that there has been any extensive concert amongst\r\nthem. Each parish, generally speaking, has risen _per se_; in many\r\nplaces their proceedings have been managed with astonishing coolness\r\nand regularity; there has been little of the ordinary effervescence\r\ndisplayed on similar occasions. The farmers have notice to meet the\r\nmen: a deputation of two or more of the latter produce a written\r\nstatement, well drawn up, which the farmers are required to sign; the\r\nspokesman, sometimes a Dissenting or Methodist teacher, fulfils his\r\noffice with great propriety and temper. Where disorder has occurred,\r\nit has arisen from dislike to some obnoxious clergyman, or tithe man,\r\nor assistant overseer, who has been trundled out of the parish in a\r\nwheelbarrow, or drawn in triumph in a load of ballast by a dozen old\r\nwomen. The farmers universally agreed to the demands they made: that\r\nis, they were not mad enough to refuse requests which they could not\r\ndemonstrate to be unreasonable in themselves, and which were urged by\r\nthree hundred or four hundred men after a barn or two had been fired,\r\nand each farmer had an incendiary letter addressed to him in his\r\npocket.’\r\n\r\nThere was another development of the movement which is not noted in\r\nthis account by the correspondent of the _Times_. It often happened\r\nthat the farmers would agree to pay the wages demanded by the\r\nlabourers, but would add that they could not continue to pay those\r\nwages unless rents and tithes were reduced. The labourers generally\r\ntook the hint and turned their attention to tithes and rents,\r\nparticularly to tithes. Their usual procedure was to go in a body to\r\nthe rector, often accompanied by the farmers, and demand an abatement\r\nof tithes, or else to attend the tithe audit and put some not unwelcome\r\npressure upon the farmers to prevent them from paying.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the agitation for a living wage was\r\nconfined to the triangular district named above, though there it\r\ntook a more systematic shape. Among the Home Office Papers is a very\r\ninteresting letter from Mr. D. Bishop, a London police officer,\r\nwritten from Deal on 11th November, describing the state of things in\r\nthat neighbourhood: ‘I have gone to the different Pot Houses in the\r\nVillages, disguised among the Labourers, of an evening and all their\r\ntalk is about the wages, some give 1s. 8d. per day some 2s. some 2s.\r\n3d.... all they say they want is 2s. 6d. per day and then they say\r\nthey shall be comfortable. I have every reason to believe the Farmers\r\nwill give the 2s. 6d. per day after a bit ... they are going to have a\r\nmeeting and I think it will stop all outrages.’\r\n\r\nThe disturbances in Sussex began with a fire on 3rd November at an\r\noverseer’s in Battle. The explanation suggested by the authorities\r\nwas that the paupers had been ‘excited by a lecture lately given here\r\npublicly by a person named Cobbett.’ Next night there was another\r\nfire at Battle; but it was at Brede, a village near Rye, that open\r\nhostilities began. As the rising at Brede set the fashion for the\r\ndistrict, it is perhaps worth while to describe it in some detail.[426]\r\n\r\nFor a long time the poor of Brede had smarted under the insults of\r\nMr. Abel, the assistant overseer, who, among other innovations, had\r\nintroduced one of the hated parish carts, and the labourers were\r\ndetermined to have a reckoning with him. After some preliminary\r\ndiscussions on the previous day, the labourers held a meeting on 5th\r\nNovember, and deputed four men to negotiate with the farmers. At the\r\nconference which resulted, the following resolutions, drawn up by the\r\nlabourers, were signed by both parties[427]:--\r\n\r\n ‘Nov. 5, 1830. At a meeting held this day at the Red Lion, of the\r\n farmers, to meet the poor labourers who delegated David Noakes Senior,\r\n Thomas Henley, Joseph Bryant and Th. Noakes, to meet the gentlemen\r\n this day to discuss the present distress of the poor.... Resolution 1.\r\n The gentlemen agree to give to every able-bodied labourer with wife\r\n and two children 2s. 3d. per day, from this day to the 1st of March\r\n next, and from the 1st of March to the 1st of Oct. 2s. 6d. per day,\r\n and to have 1s. 6d. per week with three children, and so on according\r\n to their family. Resolution 2. The poor are determined to take the\r\n present overseer, Mr. Abell, out of the parish to any adjoining parish\r\n and to use him with civility.’\r\n\r\nThe meeting over, the labourers went to Mr. Abel’s house with their\r\nwives and children and some of the farmers, and placed the parish cart\r\nat his door. After some hammering at the gates, Mr. Abel was persuaded\r\nto come out and get into the cart. He was then solemnly drawn along\r\nby women and children, accompanied by a crowd of five hundred, to the\r\nplace of his choice, Vine Hall, near Robertsbridge, on the turnpike\r\nroad, where he was deposited with all due solemnity. Mr. Abel made his\r\nway to the nearest magistrate to lodge his complaint, while the people\r\nof the parish returned home and were regaled with beer by the farmers:\r\n‘and Mr. Coleman ... he gave every one of us half a pint of Beer, women\r\nand men, and Mr. Reed of Brede High gave us a Barrel because we had\r\ndone such a great thing in the Parish as to carry that man away, and\r\nMr. Coleman said he never was better pleased in his life than with the\r\nday’s work which had been done.’[428]\r\n\r\nThe parish rid of Mr. Abel, the next reform in the new era was to be\r\nthe reduction of tithes, and here the farmers needed the help of the\r\nlabourers. What happened is best told in the words of one of the chief\r\nactors. He describes how, a little before the tithe audit, his employer\r\ncame to him when he was working in the fields and suggested that the\r\nlabourers should see if they could ‘get a little of the tithe off’;\r\nthey were only to show themselves and not to take any violent action.\r\nOther farmers made the same suggestions to their labourers. ‘We went\r\nto the tithe audit and Mr. Hele came out and spoke to us a good while\r\nand I and David Noakes and Thomas Noakes and Thomas Henley answered him\r\nbegging as well as we could for him to throw something off for us and\r\nour poor Children and to set up a School for them and Mr. Hele said he\r\nwould see what he could do.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Coleman afterwards came out and said Mr. Hele had satisfied them\r\nall well and then Mr. Hele came out and we made our obedience to him\r\nand he to us, and we gave him three cheers and went and set the Bells\r\nringing and were all as pleased as could be at what we had done.’\r\n\r\nThe success of the Brede rising had an immediate effect on the\r\nneighbourhood, and every parish round prepared to deport its obnoxious\r\noverseer and start a new life on better wages. Burwash, Ticehurst,\r\nMayfield, Heathfield, Warbleton and Ninfield were among the parishes\r\nthat adopted the Brede programme. Sometimes the assistant overseer\r\nthought it wise to decamp before the cart was at his door. Sometimes\r\nthe mob was aggressive in its manners. ‘A very considerable Mob,’\r\nwrote Sir Godfrey Webster from Battle Abbey on 9th November, ‘to the\r\namount of nearly 500, having their Parish Officer in custody drawn\r\nin a Dung Cart, attempted to enter this town at eleven o’clock this\r\nMorning.’ The attempt was unsuccessful, and twenty of the rioters were\r\narrested. The writer of this letter is chiefly famous as Lady Holland’s\r\nfirst husband. In this emergency he seems to have displayed great\r\nzeal and energy. A second letter of his on 12th November gives a good\r\ndescription of the state of affairs round Mayfield. ‘The Collector of\r\nLord Carrington’s Tithes had been driven out of the Parish and the\r\nsame Proceeding was intended to be adopted towards the Parish Officer\r\nwho fled the place, it had been intended by the Rioters to have taken\r\nby Force this Morning as many Waggons as possible (forcibly) carried\r\noff the Tithe Corn and distributed it amongst themselves in case of\r\ninterruption they were resolved to burn it. One of the most violent\r\nand dangerous papers I have yet seen (a copy of which I enclose) was\r\ncarried round the 3 adjoining Parishes and unfortunately was assented\r\nto by too many Occupiers of Land. I arrived in Time to prevent its\r\ncirculation at Mayfield a small Town tho’ populous parish 3000. By\r\napprehending the Bearer of the Paper who acted as Chief of the Party\r\nand instantly in presence of a large Mob committing him for Trial I\r\nsucceeded in repressing the tumultuous action then going on, and by\r\nsubsequently calling together the Occupiers of Land, and afterwards the\r\nMob (composed wholly of Agricultural Labourers) I had the satisfaction\r\nof mediating an arrangement between them perfectly to the content of\r\neach party, and on my leaving Mayfield this afternoon tranquillity was\r\nperfectly restored at that Place.’ The violent and dangerous paper\r\nenclosed ran thus: ‘Now gentlemen this is wat we intend to have for a\r\nmaried man to have 2s. and 3d. per Day and all over two children 1s.\r\n6d. per head a week and if a Man has got any boys or girls over age\r\nfor to have employ that they may live by there Labour and likewise all\r\nsingle men to have 1s. 9d. a day per head and we intend to have the\r\nrents lowered likewise and this is what we intend to have before we\r\nleave the place and if ther is no alteration we shall proceed further\r\nabout it. For we are all at one and we will keep to each other.’\r\n\r\nAt Ringmer in Sussex the proceedings were marked by moderation and\r\norder. Lord Gage, the principal landowner of the neighbourhood, knowing\r\nthat disturbances were imminent, met the labourers by appointment on\r\nthe village green. There were about one hundred and fifty persons\r\npresent. By this time magistrates in many places had taken to arresting\r\narbitrarily the ringleaders of the men, and hence when Lord Gage, who\r\nprobably had no such intention, asked for the leader or captain nobody\r\ncame forward, but a letter was thrown into the ring with a general\r\nshout. The letter which Lord Gage picked up and took to the Vestry\r\nfor consideration read as follows: ‘We the labourers of Ringmer and\r\nsurrounding villages, having for a long period suffered the greatest\r\nprivations and endured the most debasing treatment with the greatest\r\nresignation and forbearance, in the hope that time and circumstances\r\nwould bring about an amelioration of our condition, till, worn out\r\nby hope deferred and disappointed in our fond expectations, we have\r\ntaken this method of assembling ourselves in one general body, for the\r\npurpose of making known our grievances, and in a peaceable, quiet,\r\nand orderly manner, to ask redress; and we would rather appeal to\r\nthe good sense of the magistracy, instead of inflaming the passions\r\nof our fellow labourers, and ask those gentlemen who have done us the\r\nfavour of meeting us this day whether 7d. a day is sufficient for a\r\nworking man, hale and hearty, to keep up the strength necessary to\r\nthe execution of the labour he has to do? We ask also, is 9s. a week\r\nsufficient for a married man with a family, to provide the common\r\nnecessaries of life? Have we no reason to complain that we have been\r\nobliged for so long a period to go to our daily toil with only potatoes\r\nin our satchels, and the only beverage to assuage our thirst the cold\r\nspring; and on retiring to our cottages to be welcomed by the meagre\r\nand half-famished offspring of our toilworn bodies? All we ask, then,\r\nis that our wages may be advanced to such a degree as will enable us\r\nto provide for ourselves and families without being driven to the\r\noverseer, who, by the bye, is a stranger amongst us, and as in most\r\ninstances where permanent overseers are appointed, are men callous to\r\nthe ties of nature, lost to every feeling of humanity, and deaf to\r\nthe voice of reason. We say we want wages sufficient to support us,\r\nwithout being driven to the overseer to experience his petty tyranny\r\nand dictation. We therefore ask for married men 2s. 3d. per day to\r\nthe first of March, and from that period to the first of October 2s.\r\n6d. a day: for single men 1s. 9d. a day to the first of March, and\r\n2s. from that time to the first of October. We also request that the\r\npermanent overseers of the neighbouring parishes may be directly\r\ndischarged, particularly Finch, the governor of Ringmer poorhouse and\r\noverseer of the parish, that in case we are obliged, through misfortune\r\nor affliction, to seek parochial relief, we may apply to one of our\r\nneighbouring farmers or tradesmen, who would naturally feel some\r\nsympathy for our situation, and who would be much better acquainted\r\nwith our characters and claims. This is what we ask at your hands--this\r\nis what we expect, and we sincerely trust this is what we shall not be\r\nunder the painful necessity of demanding.’\r\n\r\nWhile the Vestry deliberated the labourers remained quietly in the yard\r\nof the poorhouse. One of them, a veteran from the Peninsular War who\r\nhad lost a limb, contrasted his situation on 9d. a day with that of the\r\nDuke of Wellington whose ‘skin was whole’ and whose pension was £60,000\r\na year. After they had waited some time, they were informed that their\r\ndemands were granted, and they dispersed to their homes with huzzas and\r\ntears of joy, and as a sign of the new and auspicious era they broke\r\nup the parish grindstone, a memory of the evil past.[429]\r\n\r\nAn important feature of the proceedings in Kent and Sussex was the\r\nsympathy of other classes with the demands of the labourers. The\r\nsuccess of the movement in Kent and Sussex, and especially of the\r\nrising that began at Brede, was due partly, no doubt, to the fact that\r\nsmuggling was still a common practice in those counties, and that the\r\nagricultural labourers thus found their natural leaders among men who\r\nhad learnt audacity, resourcefulness, and a habit of common action\r\nin that school of danger. But the movement could not have made such\r\nheadway without any serious attempt to suppress it if the other classes\r\nhad been hostile. There was a general sense that the risings were due\r\nto the neglect of the Government. Mr. Hodges, one of the Members for\r\nKent, declared in the House of Commons on 10th December that if the\r\nDuke of Wellington had attended to a petition received from the entire\r\nGrand Jury of Kent there would have been no disturbances.[430]\r\n\r\nThe same spirit is displayed in a letter written by a magistrate at\r\nBattle, named Collingwood. ‘I have seen three or four of our parochial\r\ninsurrections, and been with the People for hours alone and discussing\r\ntheir matters with them which they do with a temper and respectful\r\nbehaviour and an intelligence which must interest everyone in their\r\nfavor. The poor in the Parishes in the South of England, and in Sussex\r\nand Kent greatly, have been ground to the dust in many instances by\r\nthe Poor Laws. Instead of happy peasants they are made miserable and\r\nsour tempered paupers. Every Parish has its own peculiar system,\r\ndirected more strictly, and executed with more or less severity or\r\nharshness. A principal tradesman in Salehurst (Sussex) in one part\r\nof which, Robertsbridge, we had our row the other night, said to me\r\nthese words “You attended our meeting the other day and voted with me\r\nagainst the two principal Rate payers in this parish, two Millers,\r\npaying the people in two gallons of bad flour instead of money. You\r\nheard how saucy they were to their betters, can you wonder if they\r\nare more violent to their inferiors? They never call a man Tom, Dick\r\netc. but you d----d rascal etc., at every word, and force them to take\r\ntheir flour. Should you wonder that they are dissatisfied?” These\r\nwords he used to me a week before our Robertsbridge Row. Each of these\r\nParochial Rows differs in character as the man whom they select as\r\nleader differs in impudence or courage or audacity or whatever you may\r\ncall it. If they are opposed at the moment, their resistance shows\r\nitself in more or less violent outrages; personally I witnessed but\r\none, that of Robertsbridge putting Mr. Johnson into the cart, and that\r\nwas half an accident. I was a stranger to them, went among them and\r\nwas told by hundreds after that most unjustifiable assault that I was\r\nsafe among them as in my bed, and I never thought otherwise. One or two\r\ndesperate characters, and such there are, may at any moment make the\r\ncontest of Parish A differ from that of Parish B, but their spirit, as\r\nfar as regards loyalty and love for the King and Laws, is, I believe,\r\non my conscience, sound. I feel convinced that all the cavalry in the\r\nworld, if sent into Sussex, and all the spirited acts of Sir Godfrey\r\nWebster, who, however, is invaluable here will (not?) stop this spirit\r\nfrom running through Hampshire, Wiltshire, Somersetshire, where Mr.\r\nHobhouse, your predecessor, told me the other day that they have got\r\nthe wages for single men down to 6s. per week (on which they _cannot\r\nlive_) through many other counties. In a week you will have demands for\r\ncavalry from Hampshire under the same feeling of alarm as I and all\r\nhere entertained: the next week from Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and all\r\nthe counties in which the poor Rates have been raised for the payment\r\nof the poor up to Essex and the very neighbourhood of London, where Mr.\r\nGeo. Palmer, a magistrate, told me lately that the poor single man is\r\ngot down to 6s. I shall be over to-morrow probably at Benenden where\r\nthey are resolved not to let either Mr. Hodges’s taxes, the tithes or\r\nthe King’s taxes be paid. So I hear, and so I dare say two or three\r\ncarter boys may have said. I shall go to-morrow and if I see occasion\r\nwill arrest some man, and break his head with my staff. But do you\r\nsuppose that that (though a show of vigor is not without avail) will\r\nprevent Somersetshire men from crying out, when the train has got to\r\nthem, we will not _live_ on 6s. per week, for living it is not, but\r\na long starving, and we will have tithes and taxes, and I know not\r\nwhat else done away with. The only way to stop them is to run before\r\nthe evil. Let the Hampshire Magistrates and Vestries raise the wages\r\nbefore the Row gets to their County, and you will stop the thing from\r\nspreading, otherwise you will not, I am satisfied. In saying all this,\r\nI know that I differ with many able and excellent Magistrates, and my\r\nopinion may be wrong, but I state it to you.’\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that magistrates holding these opinions acted\r\nrather less vigorously than the central Government wished, and that\r\nLord Camden’s appeals to them not to let their political feelings\r\nand ‘fanciful Crotchets’[431] interfere with their activity were\r\nunsuccessful. But even had all the magistrates been united and eager\r\nto crush the risings they could not act without support from classes\r\nthat were reluctant to give it. The first thought of the big landed\r\nproprietors was to re-establish the yeomanry, but they found an\r\nunexpected obstacle in the temper of the farmers. The High Sheriff,\r\nafter consultation with the Home Secretary, convened a meeting for\r\nthis purpose at Canterbury on 1st November, but proceedings took an\r\nunexpected turn, the farmers recommending as a preferable alternative\r\nthat public salaries should be reduced, and the meeting adjourned\r\nwithout result. There were similar surprises at other meetings summoned\r\nwith this object, and landlords who expected to find the farmers\r\nrallying to their support were met with awkward resolutions calling\r\nfor reductions in rent and tithes. The _Kent Herald_ went so far as\r\nto say that only the dependents of great landowners will join the\r\nyeomanry, ‘this most unpopular corps.’ The magistrates found it equally\r\ndifficult to enlist special constables, the farmers and tradesmen\r\ndefinitely refusing to act in this capacity at Maidstone, at Cranbrook,\r\nat Tonbridge, and at Tonbridge Wells,[432] as well as in the smaller\r\nvillages. The chairman of the Battle magistrates wrote to the Home\r\nOffice to say that he intended to reduce his rents in the hope that the\r\nfarmers would then consent to serve.\r\n\r\nEven the Coast Blockade Service was not considered trustworthy.\r\n‘It is the last force,’ wrote one magistrate, ‘I should resort to,\r\non account of the feeling which exists between them and the people\r\nhereabouts.’[433] In the absence of local help, the magistrates had to\r\nrely on military aid to quell a mob, or to execute a warrant. Demands\r\nfor troops from different quarters were incessant, and sometimes\r\nquerulous. ‘If you cannot send a military force,’ wrote one indignant\r\ncountry gentleman from Heathfield on 14th November, ‘for God’s sake,\r\nsay so, without delay, in order that we may remove our families to\r\na place of safety from a district which want of support renders us\r\ntotally unable longer to defend.’[434] Troops were despatched to\r\nCranbrook, but when the Battle magistrates sent thither for help they\r\nwere told to their great annoyance that no soldiers could be spared.\r\nThe Government indeed found it impossible to supply enough troops. ‘My\r\ndear Lord Liverpool,’ wrote Sir Robert Peel on 15th November, ‘since\r\nI last saw you I have made arrangements for sending every disposable\r\ncavalry soldier into Kent and the east part of Sussex. General Dalbiac\r\nwill take the command. He will be at Battel to-day to confer with\r\nthe Magistracy and to attempt to establish some effectual plan of\r\noperations against the rioters.’\r\n\r\nThe 7th Dragoon Guards at Canterbury were to provide for East Kent;\r\nthe 2nd Dragoon Guards at Maidstone were to provide for Mid-Kent;\r\nand the 5th Dragoon Guards at Tunbridge Wells for the whole of East\r\nSussex. Sir Robert Peel meanwhile thought that the magistrates should\r\nthemselves play a more active part, and he continually expressed the\r\nhope that they would ‘meet and concert some effectual mode of resisting\r\nthe illegal demands.’[435] He deprecated strongly the action of\r\ncertain magistrates in yielding to the mobs. Mr. Collingwood, who has\r\nbeen mentioned already, received a severe reproof for his behaviour\r\nat Goudhurst, where he had adopted a conciliatory policy and let off\r\nthe rioters on their own recognisances. ‘We did not think the case a\r\nvery strong one,’ he wrote on 18th November, ‘or see any very urgent\r\nnecessity for the apprehension of Eaves, nor after Captain King’s\r\nstatement that he had not felt a blow, could we consider the assault\r\nof a magistrate proved. The whole parish unanimously begged them off,\r\nand said that their being discharged on their own recognisances would\r\nprobably contribute to the peace of the parish.’\r\n\r\nThe same weakness, or sympathy, was displayed by magistrates in the\r\nwestern part of Sussex, where the rising spread after the middle\r\nof November. In the Arundel district the magistrates anticipated\r\ndisturbances by holding a meeting of the inhabitants to fix the scale\r\nof wages. The wages agreed on were ‘2s. a day wet and dry and 1s. 6d. a\r\nweek for every child (above 2) under 4,’ during the winter: from Lady\r\nDay to Michaelmas 14s. a week, wet and dry, with the same allowance for\r\nchildren. A scale was also drawn up for lads and young men. The mobs\r\nwere demanding 14s. a week all the year round, but they seem to have\r\nacquiesced in the Arundel scale, and to have given no further trouble.\r\nAt Horsham, the labourers adopted more violent measures and met with\r\nalmost universal sympathy. There was a strong Radical party in that\r\ntown, and one magistrate described it later as ‘a hot Bed of Sedition.’\r\nAttempts were made, without success, to show that the Radicals were at\r\nthe bottom of the disturbances. The district round Horsham was in an\r\nagitated state. Among others who received threatening letters was Sir\r\nTimothy Shelley of Field Place. The letter was couched in the general\r\nspirit of Shelley’s song to the men of England:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Men of England, wherefore plough,\r\n    For the lords who lay ye low,’\r\n\r\nwhich his father may, or may not, have read. The writer urged him,\r\n‘if you wish to escape the impending danger in this world and in that\r\nwhich is to come,’ to go round to the miserable beings from whom he\r\nexacted tithes, ‘and enquire and hear from there own lips what disstres\r\nthere in.’ Like many of these letters, it contained at the end a rough\r\npicture of a knife, with ‘Beware of the fatel daggar’ inscribed on it.\r\n\r\nIn Horsham itself the mob, composed of from seven hundred to a thousand\r\npersons, summoned a vestry meeting in the church. Mr. Sanctuary, the\r\nHigh Sheriff for Sussex, described the episode in a letter to the\r\nHome Office on the same day (18th November). The labourers, he said,\r\ndemanded 2s. 6d. a day, and the lowering of rents and tithes: ‘all\r\nthese complaints were attended to----thought reasonable and complied\r\nwith,’ and the meeting dispersed quietly. Anticipating, it may be,\r\nsome censure, he added, ‘I should have found it quite impossible to\r\nhave prevailed upon any person to serve as special constable----most\r\nof the tradespeople and many of the farmers considering the demands of\r\nthe people but just (and) equitable----indeed many of them advocated\r\n(them)----a doctor spoke about the taxes----but no one backed\r\nhim----that was not the object of the meeting.’ A lady living at\r\nHorsham wrote a more vivid account of the day’s work. She described how\r\nthe mob made everybody come to the church. Mr. Simpson, the vicar, went\r\nwithout more ado, but Mr. Hurst, senior, owner of the great tithes,\r\nheld out till the mob seized a chariot from the King’s Arms and dragged\r\nit to his door. Whilst the chariot was being brought he slipped out,\r\nand entered the church with his two sons. All the gentlemen stood up\r\nat the altar, while the farmers encouraged the labourers in the body of\r\nthe church. ‘Mr. Hurst held out so long that it was feared blood would\r\nbe shed, the Doors were shut till the Demands were granted, no lights\r\nwere allowed, the Iron railing that surrounds the Monuments torn up,\r\nand the sacred boundary between the chancel and Altar overleapt before\r\nhe would yield.’ Mr. Hurst himself wrote to the Home Office to say that\r\nit was only the promise to reduce rents and tithes that had prevented\r\nserious riots, but he met with little sympathy at headquarters. ‘I\r\ncannot concur,’ wrote Sir Robert Peel, ‘in the opinion of Mr. Hurst\r\nthat it was expedient or necessary for the Vestry to yield to the\r\ndemands of the Mob. In every case that I have seen, in which the mob\r\nhas been firmly and temperately resisted, they have given way without\r\nresorting to personal violence.’ A neighbouring magistrate, who shared\r\nSir Robert Peel’s opinion about the affair, went to Horsham a day\r\nor two later to swear in special constables. He found that out of\r\nsixty-three ‘respectable householders’ four only would take the oath.\r\nMeanwhile the difficulties of providing troops increased with the area\r\nof disturbances. ‘I have requested that every effort may be made to\r\nreinforce the troops in the western part of Sussex,’ wrote Sir Robert\r\nPeel to a Horsham magistrate on 18th November, ‘and you may judge\r\nof the difficulty of doing so, when I mention to you that the most\r\nexpeditious mode of effecting this is to bring from Dorchester _the\r\nonly_ cavalry force that is in the West of England. This, however,\r\nshall be done, and 100 men (infantry) shall be brought from the\r\nGarrison of Portsmouth.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of November the rising was confined to Kent, Sussex\r\nand parts of Surrey, with occasional fires and threatening letters in\r\nneighbouring counties. After that time the disturbances became more\r\nserious, spreading not only to the West of Sussex, but to Berkshire,\r\nHampshire, and Wiltshire. On 22nd November the Duke of Buckingham wrote\r\nfrom Avington in Hampshire to the Duke of Wellington: ‘Nothing can be\r\nworse than the state of this neighbourhood. I may say that this part\r\nof the country is wholly in the hands of the rebels ... 1500 rioters\r\nare to assemble to-morrow morning, and will attack any farmhouses where\r\nthere are threshing machines. They go about levying contributions on\r\nevery gentleman’s house. There are very few magistrates; and what\r\nthere are are completely cowed. In short, something decisive must\r\ninstantly be done.’\r\n\r\nThe risings in these counties differed in some respects from the rising\r\nin Kent and Sussex. The disturbances were not so much like the firing\r\nof a train of discontent, they were rather a sudden and spontaneous\r\nexplosion. They lasted only about a week, and were well described in\r\na report of Colonel Brotherton, one of the two military experts sent\r\nby Lord Melbourne to Wiltshire to advise the magistrates. He wrote on\r\n28th November: ‘The insurrectionary movement seems to be directed by\r\nno plan or system, but merely actuated by the spontaneous feeling of\r\nthe peasantry and quite at random.’ The labourers went about in larger\r\nnumbers, combining with the destruction of threshing machines and the\r\ndemand for higher wages a claim for ‘satisfaction’ as they called it\r\nin the form of ready money. It was their practice to charge £2 for\r\nbreaking a threshing machine, but in some cases the mobs were satisfied\r\nwith a few coppers. The demand for ready money was not a new feature,\r\nfor many correspondents of the Home Office note in their letters that\r\nthe mobs levied money in Kent and Sussex, but hitherto this ‘sturdy\r\nbegging,’ as Cobbett called it, had been regarded by the magistrates\r\nas unimportant. The wages demanded in these counties were 2s. a day,\r\nwhereas the demands in Kent and usually in Sussex had been for 2s. 6d.\r\nor 2s. 3d. Wages had fallen to a lower level in Hampshire, Berkshire\r\nand Wiltshire. The current rate in Wiltshire was 7s., and Colonel Mair,\r\nthe second officer sent down by the Home Office, reported that wages\r\nwere sometimes as low as 6s. It is therefore not surprising to learn\r\nthat in two parishes the labourers instead of asking for 2s. a day,\r\nasked only for 8s. or 9s. a week. In Berkshire wages varied from 7s. to\r\n9s., and in Hampshire the usual rate seems to have been 8s.\r\n\r\nThe rising in Hampshire was marked by a considerable destruction of\r\nproperty. At Fordingbridge, the mob under the leadership of a man\r\ncalled Cooper, broke up the machinery both at a sacking manufactory\r\nand at a manufactory of threshing machines. Cooper was soon clothed in\r\ninnumerable legends: he was a gipsy, a mysterious gentleman, possibly\r\nthe renowned ‘Swing’ himself. At the Fordingbridge riots he rode\r\non horseback and assumed the title of Captain Hunt. His followers\r\naddressed him bareheaded. In point of fact he was an agricultural\r\nlabourer of good character, a native of East Grimstead in Wilts,\r\nwho had served in the artillery in the French War. Some two months\r\nbefore the riots his wife had robbed him, and then eloped with a\r\nparamour. This unhinged his self-control; he gave himself up to drink\r\nand despair, and tried to forget his misery in reckless rioting. Near\r\nAndover again a foundry was destroyed by a mob, after the ringleader,\r\nGilmore, had entered the justices’ room at Andover, where the justices\r\nwere sitting, and treated with them on behalf of the mob. Gilmore also\r\nwas a labourer; he was twenty-five years old and had been a soldier.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting event in the Hampshire rising was the destruction\r\nof the workhouses at Selborne and Headley. Little is reported of the\r\ndemolition of the poorhouse at Selborne. The indictment of the persons\r\naccused of taking part in it fell through on technical grounds, and\r\nas the defendants were also the persons charged with destroying the\r\nHeadley workhouse, the prosecution in the Selborne case was abandoned.\r\nThe mob first went to Mr. Cobbold, Vicar of Selborne, and demanded\r\nthat he should reduce his tithes, telling him with some bluntness ‘we\r\nmust have a touch of your tithes: we think £300 a year quite enough\r\nfor you ... £4 a week is quite enough.’ Mr. Cobbold was thoroughly\r\nalarmed, and consented to sign a paper promising to reduce his tithes,\r\nwhich amounted to something over £600, by half that sum. The mob were\r\naccompanied by a good many farmers who had agreed to raise wages if\r\nthe labourers would undertake to obtain a reduction of tithes, and\r\nthese farmers signed the paper also. After Mr. Cobbold’s surrender the\r\nmob went on to the workhouse at Headley, which served the parishes of\r\nBramshott, Headley and Kingsley. Their leader was a certain Robert\r\nHoldaway, a wheelwright, who had been for a short time a publican. He\r\nwas a widower, with eight small children, described by the witnesses\r\nat his trial as a man of excellent character, quiet, industrious, and\r\ninoffensive. The master of the workhouse greeted Holdaway with ‘What,\r\nHoldy, are you here?’ ‘Yes, but I mean you no harm nor your wife nor\r\nyour goods: so get them out as soon as you can, for the house must\r\ncome down.’ The master warned him that there were old people and\r\nsick children in the house. Holdaway promised that they should be\r\nprotected, asked where they were, and said the window would be marked.\r\nWhat followed is described in the evidence given by the master of the\r\nworkhouse: ‘There was not a room left entire, except that in which the\r\nsick children were. These were removed into the yard on two beds, and\r\ncovered over, and kept from harm all the time. This was done by the\r\nmob. They were left there because there was no room for them in the\r\nsick ward. The sick ward was full of infirm old paupers. It was not\r\ntouched, but of all the rest of the place not a room was left entire.’\r\nThe farmers looked on whilst the destruction proceeded, and one at\r\nleast of the labourers in the mob declared afterwards that his master\r\nhad forced him to join.\r\n\r\nIn Wiltshire also the destruction of property was not confined to\r\nthreshing machines. At Wilton, the mob, under the leadership of a\r\ncertain John Jennings, aged eighteen,[436] who declared that he ‘was\r\ngoing to break the machinery to make more work for the poor people,’\r\ndid £500 worth of damage in a woollen mill. Another cloth factory at\r\nQuidhampton was also injured; in this affair an active part was taken\r\nby a boy even younger than Jennings, John Ford, who was only seventeen\r\nyears old.[437]\r\n\r\nThe riot which attracted most attention of all the disturbances in\r\nWiltshire took place at Pyt House, the seat of Mr. John Benett, M.P.\r\nfor the county. Mr. Benett was a well-known local figure, and had given\r\nevidence before several Committees on Poor Laws. The depth of his\r\nsympathy with the labourers may be gauged by the threat that he uttered\r\nbefore the Committee of 1817 to pull down his cottages if Parliament\r\nshould make length of residence a legal method of gaining a settlement.\r\nSome member of the Committee suggested that if there were no cottages\r\nthere would be no labourers, but Mr. Benett replied cheerfully enough\r\nthat it did not matter to a labourer how far he walked to his work:\r\n‘I have many labourers coming three miles to my farm every morning\r\nduring the winter’ (the hours were six to six) ‘and they are the most\r\npunctual persons we have.’ At the time he gave this evidence, he stated\r\nthat about three-quarters of the labouring population in his parish\r\nof Tisbury received relief from the poor rates in aid of wages, and\r\nhe declared that it was useless to let them small parcels of land.\r\nThe condition of the poor had not improved in Mr. Benett’s parish\r\nbetween 1817 and 1830, and Lord Arundel, who lived in it, described\r\nit as ‘a Parish in which the Poor have been more oppressed and are in\r\ngreater misery as a whole than any Parish in the Kingdom.’[438] It is\r\nnot surprising that when the news of what had been achieved in Kent\r\nand Sussex spread west to Wiltshire, the labourers of Tisbury rose\r\nto demand 2s. a day, and to destroy the threshing machines. A mob of\r\nfive hundred persons collected, and their first act was to destroy a\r\nthreshing machine, with the sanction of the owner, Mr. Turner, who sat\r\nby on horseback, watching them. They afterwards proceeded to the Pyt\r\nHouse estate. Mr. Benett met them, parleyed and rode with them for some\r\nway; they behaved politely but firmly, telling him their intentions.\r\nOne incident throws a light on the minds of the actors in these scenes.\r\n‘I then,’ said Mr. Benett afterwards, ‘pointed out to them that they\r\ncould not trust each other, for any man, I said, by informing against\r\nten of you will obtain at once £500.’ It was an adroit speech, but\r\nas it happened the Wiltshire labourers, half starved, degraded and\r\nbrutalised, as they might be, had a different standard of honour from\r\nthat imagined by this magistrate and member of Parliament, and the\r\ndevilish temptation he set before them was rejected. The mob destroyed\r\nvarious threshing machines on Mr. Benett’s farms, and refused to\r\ndisperse; at last, after a good deal of sharp language from Mr. Benett,\r\nthey threw stones at him. At the same time a troop of yeomanry from\r\nHindon came up and received orders to fire blank cartridges above the\r\nheads of the mob. This only produced laughter; the yeomanry then began\r\nto charge; the mob took shelter in the plantations round Pyt House and\r\nstoned the yeomanry, who replied by a fierce onslaught, shooting one\r\nman dead on the spot,[439] wounding six by cutting off fingers and\r\nopening skulls, and taking a great number of prisoners. At the inquest\r\nat Tisbury on the man John Harding, who was killed, the jury returned\r\na verdict of justifiable homicide, and the coroner refused to grant\r\na warrant for burial, saying that the man’s action was equivalent to\r\n_felo de se_. Hunt stated in the House of Commons that the foreman of\r\nthe jury was the father of one of the yeomen.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in these counties the magistrates took a very grave\r\nview of the crime of levying money from householders. This was often\r\ndone by casual bands of men and boys, who had little connection with\r\nthe organised rising. An examination of the cases described before\r\nthe Special Commissions gives the impression that in point of fact\r\nthere was very little danger to person or property. A farmer’s wife\r\nat Aston Tirrold in Berkshire described her own experience to the\r\nAbingdon Special Commission. A mob came to her house and demanded beer.\r\nHer husband was out and she went to the door. ‘Bennett was spokesman.\r\nHe said “Now a little of your beer if you please.” I answered “Not a\r\ndrop.” He asked “Why?” and I said “I cannot give beer to encourage\r\nriot.” Bennett said “Why you don’t call this rioting do you?” I said\r\n“I don’t know what you call it, but it is a number of people assembled\r\ntogether to alarm others: but don’t think I’m afraid or daunted at it.”\r\nBennett said “Suppose your premises should be set on fire?” I said\r\n“Then I certainly should be alarmed but I don’t suppose either of you\r\nintends doing that.” Bennett said “No, we do not intend any such thing,\r\nI don’t wish to alarm you and we are not come with the intention of\r\nmischief.”’ The result of the dialogue was that Bennett and his party\r\nwent home without beer and without giving trouble.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that when mob-begging of this kind became fashionable,\r\nunpopular individuals should be singled out for rough and threatening\r\nvisits. Sometimes the assistant overseers were the objects of special\r\nhatred, sometimes the parson. It is worth while to give the facts of\r\na case at St. Mary Bourne in Hampshire, because stress was laid upon\r\nit in the subsequent prosecutions as an instance of extraordinary\r\nviolence. The clergyman, Mr. Easton, was not a favourite in his parish,\r\nand he preached what the poor regarded as a harsh and a hostile sermon.\r\nWhen the parish rose, a mob of two hundred forced their way into the\r\nvicarage and demanded money, some of them repeating, ‘Money or blood.’\r\nMrs. Easton, who was rather an invalid, Miss Lucy Easton, and Master\r\nEaston were downstairs, and Mrs. Easton was so much alarmed that she\r\nsent Lucy upstairs to fetch 10s. Meanwhile Mr. Easton had come down,\r\nand was listening to some extremely unsympathetic criticisms of his\r\nperformances in the pulpit. ‘Damn you,’ said Daniel Simms,[440] ‘where\r\nwill your text be next Sunday?’ William Simms was equally blunt and\r\nuncompromising. Meanwhile Lucy had brought down the half-sovereign, and\r\nMrs. Easton gave it to William Simms,[441] who thereupon cried ‘All\r\nout,’ and the mob left the Eastons at peace.\r\n\r\nOne representative of the Church was distinguished from most of the\r\ncountry gentlemen and clergymen of the time by his treatment of one\r\nof these wandering mobs. Cobbett’s letter to the Hampshire parsons,\r\npublished in the _Political Register_, 15th January 1831, contains an\r\naccount of the conduct of Bishop Sumner, the Bishop of Winchester. ‘I\r\nhave, at last, found a Bishop of the _Law_ Church to _praise_. The\r\nfacts are these: the Bishop, in coming from Winchester to his palace\r\nat Farnham, was met about a mile before he got to the latter place,\r\nby a band of sturdy beggars, whom some call robbers. They stopped his\r\ncarriage, and asked for some money, which he gave them. But he did not\r\n_prosecute_ them: he had not a man of them called to account for his\r\nconduct, but, the next day, set _twenty-four labourers to constant\r\nwork_, opened his Castle to the distressed of all ages, and supplied\r\nall with food and other necessaries who stood in need of them. This was\r\nbecoming a Christian teacher.’ Perhaps the bishop remembered the lines\r\nfrom Dryden’s _Tales from Chaucer_, describing the spirit in which the\r\ngood parson regarded the poor:\r\n\r\n  ‘Who, should they steal for want of his relief,\r\n  He judged himself accomplice with the thief.’\r\n\r\nThere was an exhibition of free speaking at Hungerford, where the\r\nmagistrates sat in the Town Hall to receive deputations from various\r\nmobs, in connection with the demand for higher wages. The magistrates\r\nhad made their peace with the Hungerford mob, when a deputation from\r\nthe Kintbury mob arrived, led by William Oakley, a young carpenter of\r\ntwenty-five. Oakley addressed the magistrates in language which they\r\nhad never heard before in their lives and were never likely to hear\r\nagain. ‘You have not such d----d flats to deal with now, as you had\r\nbefore; we will have 2s. a day till Lady Day, and 2s. 6d. afterwards\r\nfor labourers and 3s. 6d. for tradesmen. And as we are here we will\r\nhave £5 before we leave the place or we will smash it.... You gentlemen\r\nhave been living long enough on the good things, now is our time and\r\nwe will have them. You gentlemen would not speak to us now, only you\r\nare afraid and intimidated.’ The magistrates acceded to the demands\r\nof the Kintbury mob and also gave them the £5, after which they gave\r\nthe Hungerford mob £5, because they had behaved well, and it would be\r\nunjust to treat them worse than their Kintbury neighbours. Mr. Page,\r\nDeputy-Lieutenant for Berks, sent Lord Melbourne some tales about\r\nthis same Kintbury mob, which was described by Mr. Pearse, M.P., as\r\na set of ‘desperate savages.’ ‘I beg to add some anecdotes of the mob\r\nyesterday to illustrate the nature of its component parts. They took £2\r\nfrom Mr. Cherry a magistrate and broke his Machine. Afterwards another\r\nparty came and demanded One Pound----when the two parties had again\r\nformed into one, they passed by Mr. Cherry’s door and said they had\r\ntaken one pound too much, which they offered to return to him which it\r\nis said he refused--they had before understood that Mrs. Cherry was\r\nunwell and therefore came only in small parties. A poor woman passed\r\nthem selling rabbitts, some few of the mob took some by force, the\r\nringleader ordered them to be restored. At a farmer’s where they had\r\nbeen regaled with bread cheese and beer one of them stole an umbrella:\r\nthe ringleader hearing of it, as they were passing the canal threw him\r\ninto it and gave him a good ducking.’[442]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the rising in Hampshire, Wiltshire and Berkshire,\r\nthere was a good deal of sympathy with the labourers. The farmers in\r\nmany cases made no objection to the destruction of their threshing\r\nmachines. One gentleman of Market Lavington went so far as to say that\r\n‘nearly all the Wiltshire Farmers were willing to destroy or set aside\r\ntheir machines.’ ‘My Lord,’ wrote Mr. Williams, J.P., from Marlborough,\r\n‘you will perhaps be surprised to hear that the greatest number of\r\nthe threshing machines destroyed have been put out for the Purpose by\r\nthe Owners themselves.’ The Duke of Buckingham complained that in the\r\ndistrict round Avington ‘the farmers have not the Spirit and in some\r\ninstances not the Wish to put down’ disturbances.[443] At a meeting in\r\nWinchester, convened by the Mayor to preserve the peace (reported in\r\nthe _Hampshire Chronicle_ of 22nd November), Dr. Newbolt, a clergyman\r\nand magistrate, described his own dealings with one of the mobs. The\r\nmob said they wanted 12s. a week wages: this he said was a reasonable\r\ndemand. He acted as mediator between the labourers and farmers, and\r\nas a result of his efforts the farmers agreed to these terms, and the\r\nlabourers returned to work, abandoning their project of a descent\r\non Winchester. The Mayor of Winchester also declared that the wages\r\ndemanded were not unreasonable, and he laid stress on the fact that the\r\nobject of the meeting was not to appoint special constables to come\r\ninto conflict with the people, but merely to preserve the peace. Next\r\nweek Dr. Newbolt put an advertisement into the _Hampshire Chronicle_,\r\nacknowledging the vote of thanks that had been passed to him, and\r\nreaffirming his belief that conciliation was the right policy.[444] At\r\nOverton, in Hampshire, Henry Hunt acted as mediator between the farmers\r\nand a hungry and menacing mob. Such was the fear of the farmers that\r\nthey gave him unlimited power to make promises on their behalf: he\r\npromised the labourers that their wages should be raised from 9s. to\r\n12s., with house rent in addition, and they dispersed in delight.\r\n\r\nFortune had so far smiled upon the rising, and there was some hope of\r\nsuccess. If the spirit that animated the farmers, and in Kent many of\r\nthe landowners, had lasted, the winter of 1830 might have ended in an\r\nimprovement of wages and a reduction of rents and tithes throughout\r\nthe south of England. In places where the decline of the labourer had\r\nbeen watched for years without pity or dismay, magistrates were now\r\ncalling meetings to consider his circumstances, and the Home Office\r\nPapers show that some, at any rate, of the country gentlemen were\r\naware of the desperate condition of the poor. Unhappily the day of\r\nconciliatory measures was a brief one. Two facts frightened the upper\r\nclasses into brutality: one was the spread of the rising, the other\r\nthe scarcity of troops.[445] As the movement spread, the alarm of the\r\nauthorities inspired a different policy, and even those landowners who\r\nrecognised that the labourers were miserable, thought that they were in\r\nthe presence of a rising that would sweep them away unless they could\r\nsuppress it at once by drastic means. They pictured the labourers as\r\nHuns and the mysterious Swing as a second Attila, and this panic they\r\ncontrived to communicate to the other classes of society.\r\n\r\nConciliatory methods consequently ceased; the upper classes substituted\r\naction for diplomacy, and the movement rapidly collapsed. Little\r\nresistance was offered, and the terrible hosts of armed and desperate\r\nmen melted down into groups of weak and ill-fed labourers, armed with\r\nsticks and stones. On 26th November the _Times_ could report that\r\nseventy persons had been apprehended near Newbury, and that ‘about\r\n60 of the most forward half-starved fellows’ had been taken into\r\ncustody some two miles from Southampton. Already the housing of the\r\nBerkshire prisoners was becoming a problem, the gaols at Reading and\r\nAbingdon being overcrowded: by the end of the month the Newbury Mansion\r\nHouse and Workhouse had been converted into prisons. This energy had\r\nbeen stimulated by a circular letter issued on 24th November, in\r\nwhich Lord Melbourne urged the lord-lieutenants and the magistrates\r\nto use firmness and vigour in quelling disturbances, and virtually\r\npromised them immunity for illegal acts done in discharge of their\r\nduty. A village here and there continued to give the magistrates some\r\nuneasiness, for example, Broughton in Hants, ‘an open village in an\r\nopen country ... where there is no Gentleman to overawe them,’[446] but\r\nthese were exceptions. The day of risings was over, and from this time\r\nforward, arson was the only weapon of discontent. At Charlton in Wilts,\r\nwhere ‘the magistrates had talked of 12s. and the farmers had given\r\n10s.,’ a certain Mr. Polhill, who had lowered the wages one Saturday to\r\n9s., found his premises in flame. ‘The poor,’ remarked a neighbouring\r\nmagistrate, ‘naturally consider that they will be beaten down again\r\nto 7s.’[447] By 4th December the _Times_ correspondent in Wiltshire\r\nand Hampshire could report that quiet was restored, that the peasantry\r\nwere cowed, and that men who had been prominent in the mobs were being\r\npicked out and arrested every day. He gave an amusing account of the\r\ntrials of a special correspondent, and of the difficulties of obtaining\r\ninformation. ‘The circular of Lord Melbourne which encourages the\r\nmagistrates to seize suspected persons, and promises them impunity if\r\nthe motives are good (such is the construction of the circular in these\r\nparts), and which the magistrates are determined to act upon, renders\r\ninquiries unsafe, and I have received a few good natured hints on\r\nthis head. Gentlemen in gigs and post chaises are peculiar objects of\r\njealousy. A cigar, which is no slight comfort in this humid atmosphere,\r\nis regarded on the road as a species of pyrotechnical tube; and even an\r\neye glass is in danger of being metamorphosed into a newly invented air\r\ngun, with which these _gentlemen_ ignite stacks and barns as they pass.\r\nAn innocent enquiry of whose house or farm is that? is, under existing\r\ncircumstances, an overt act of incendiarism.’\r\n\r\nIn such a state of feeling, it was not surprising that labourers were\r\nbundled into prison for sour looks or discontented conversation. A\r\nzealous magistrate wrote to the Home Office on 13th December after a\r\nfire near Maidenhead, to say that he had committed a certain Greenaway\r\nto prison on the following evidence: ‘Dr. Vansittart, Rector of\r\nShottesbrook, gave a sermon a short time before the fire took place,\r\nrecommending a quiet conduct to his Parishioners. Greenaway said openly\r\nin the churchyard, we have been quiet too long. His temper is bad,\r\nalways discontented and churlish, frequently changing his Master from\r\nfinding great difficulty in maintaining a large family from the Wages\r\nof labour.’\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the rising had spread westward to Dorset and Gloucestershire,\r\nand northward to Bucks. In Dorsetshire and Gloucestershire, the\r\ndisturbances were much like those in Wiltshire. In Bucks, in addition\r\nto the usual agricultural rising, with the breaking of threshing\r\nmachines and the demand for higher wages, there were riots in High\r\nWycombe, and considerable destruction of paper-making machinery by\r\nthe unemployed. Where special grievances existed in a village, the\r\nlabourers took advantage of the rising to seek redress for them. Thus\r\nat Walden in Bucks, in addition to demanding 2s. a day wages with 6d.\r\nfor each child and a reduction of tithes, they made a special point of\r\nthe improper distribution of parish gifts. ‘Another person said that\r\nbuns used to be thrown from the church steeple and beer given away in\r\nthe churchyard, and a sermon preached on the bun day. Witness (the\r\nparson) told them that the custom had ceased before he came to the\r\nparish, but that he always preached a sermon on St. George’s day, and\r\ntwo on Sundays, one of which was a volunteer. He told them that he had\r\nconsulted the Archdeacon on the claim set up for the distribution of\r\nbuns, and that the Archdeacon was of opinion that no such claim could\r\nbe maintained.’\r\n\r\nAt Benson or Bensington, in Oxfordshire, the labourers, after\r\ndestroying some threshing machines, made a demonstration against a\r\nproposal for enclosure. Mr. Newton, a large proprietor, had just made\r\none of many unsuccessful attempts to obtain an Enclosure Act for the\r\nparish. Some thousand persons assembled in the churchyard expecting\r\nthat Mr. Newton would try to fix the notice on the church door, but as\r\nhe did not venture to appear, they proceeded to his house, and made him\r\npromise never again to attempt to obtain an Enclosure Act.[448]\r\n\r\nThe movement for obtaining higher wages by this rude collective\r\nbargaining was extinguished in the counties already mentioned by the\r\nbeginning of December, but disturbances now developed over a larger\r\narea. A ‘daring riot’ took place at Stotfold in Bedfordshire. The\r\nlabourers met together to demand exemption from taxes, dismissal of the\r\nassistant overseer, and the raising of wages to 2s. a day. The last\r\ndemand was refused, on which the labourers set some straw alight in\r\na field to alarm the farmers. Mr. Whitbread, J.P., brought a hundred\r\nspecial constables, and arrested ten ringleaders, after which the riot\r\nceased. There were disturbances in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex; and in\r\nmany other counties the propertied classes were terrified from time\r\nto time by the news of fires. In Cambridgeshire there were meetings\r\nof labourers to demand higher wages, in some places with immediate\r\nsuccess, and one magistrate was alarmed by rumours of a design to march\r\nupon Cambridge itself on market day. In Devonshire Lord Ebrington\r\nreported an agitation for higher wages with encouragement from the\r\nfarmers. He was himself impressed by the low wages in force, and had\r\nraised them in places still quiet; a mistake for which he apologised.\r\nEven Hereford, ‘this hitherto submissive and peaceful county,’ was not\r\nunaffected. In Northamptonshire there were several fires, and also\r\nrisings round Peterborough, Oundle and Wellingborough, and a general\r\noutbreak in the Midlands was thought to be imminent. Hayricks began\r\nto blaze as far north as Carlisle. Swing letters were delivered in\r\nYorkshire, and in Lincolnshire the labourer was said to be awakening\r\nto his own importance. There were in fact few counties quite free\r\nfrom infection, and a leading article appeared in the _Times_ on 6th\r\nDecember, in which it was stated that never had such a dangerous state\r\nof things existed to such an extent in England, in the period of\r\nwell-authenticated records. ‘Let the rich be taught that Providence\r\nwill not suffer them to oppress their fellow creatures with impunity.\r\nHere are tens of thousands of Englishmen, industrious, kind-hearted,\r\nbut broken-hearted beings, exasperated into madness by insufficient\r\nfood and clothing, by utter want of necessaries for themselves and\r\ntheir unfortunate families.’\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Providence, to whom the _Times_ attributed these\r\nrevolutionary sentiments, was not so close to the scene as Lord\r\nMelbourne, whose sentiments on the subject were very different. On 8th\r\nDecember he issued a circular, which gave a death-blow to the hope that\r\nthe magistrates would act as mediators on behalf of the labourers.\r\nAfter blaming those magistrates who, under intimidation, had advised\r\nthe establishment of a uniform rate of wages, the Home Secretary went\r\non, ‘Reason and experience concur in proving that a compliance with\r\ndemands so unreasonable in themselves, and urged in such a manner, can\r\nonly lead, and probably within a very short period of time, to the most\r\ndisastrous results.’ He added that the justices had ‘no general legal\r\nauthority to settle the amount of the wages of labour.’ The circular\r\ncontained a promise on the part of the Government that they would adopt\r\n‘every practicable and reasonable measure’ for the alleviation of the\r\nlabourers’ privations.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the magistrates were everywhere on the alert for the\r\nfirst signs of life and movement among the labourers, and they forbade\r\nmeetings of any kind. In Suffolk and Essex the labourers who took\r\nup the cry for higher wages were promptly thrown into prison, and\r\narbitrary arrests became the custom. The movement was crushed, and the\r\ntime for retribution had come. The gaols were full to overflowing,\r\nand the Government appointed Special Commissions to try the rioters\r\nin Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset, Berks, and Bucks. Brougham, who was\r\nnow enjoying the office in whose pompous manner he must have lisped\r\nin his cradle, told the House of Lords on 2nd December, ‘Within a few\r\ndays from the time I am addressing your Lordships, the sword of justice\r\nshall be unsheathed to smite, if it be necessary, with a firm and\r\nvigorous hand, the rebel against the law.’\r\n\r\nThe disturbances were over, but the panic had been such that the\r\nupper classes could not persuade themselves that England was yet\r\ntranquil. As late as Christmas Eve the Privy Council gave orders to the\r\narchbishop to prepare ‘a form of prayer to Almighty God, on account\r\nof the troubled state of certain parts of the United Kingdom.’ The\r\narchbishop’s composition, which was published after scores of men and\r\nboys had been sentenced to transportation for life, must have been\r\nrecited with genuine feeling by those clergymen who had either broken,\r\nor were about to break, their agreement to surrender part of their\r\ntithes. One passage ran as follows: ‘Restore, O Lord, to Thy people\r\nthe quiet enjoyment of the many and great blessings which we have\r\nreceived from Thy bounty: defeat and frustrate the malice of wicked and\r\nturbulent men, and turn their hearts: have pity, O Lord, on the simple\r\nand ignorant, who have been led astray, and recall them to a sense of\r\ntheir duty; and to persons of all ranks and conditions in this country\r\nvouchsafe such a measure of Thy grace, that our hearts being filled\r\nwith true faith and devotion, and cleansed from all evil affections,\r\nwe may serve Thee with one accord, in duty and loyalty to the King, in\r\nobedience to the laws of the land, and in brotherly love towards each\r\nother....’\r\n\r\nWe shall see in the next chapter what happened to ‘the simple and\r\nignorant’ who had fallen into the hands of the English judges.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[421] See Fawley, p. 279.\r\n\r\n[422] _Kent Herald_, September 2, 1830.\r\n\r\n[423] _Times_, January 3, 1831.\r\n\r\n[424] September 30, 1830.\r\n\r\n[425] _Brighton Chronicle_, October 6, quoted in _Times_, October 14.\r\n\r\n[426] For Brede see H.

For the privileged classes\r\nhad set up a code under which no labourer could take a single step for\r\nthe improvement of the lot of his class without putting his life and\r\nliberties in a noose. It is true that the savage laws which had been\r\npassed against combination in 1799 and 1800 had been repealed in 1824,\r\nand that even under the less liberal Act of the following year, which\r\nrescinded the Act of 1824, it was no longer a penal offence to form a\r\nTrades Union. But it is easy to see that the labourers who tried to\r\nraise their wages were in fact on a shelving and most perilous slope.\r\nIf they used threats or intimidation or molested or obstructed, either\r\nto get a labourer to join with them or to get an employer to make\r\nconcessions, they were guilty of a misdemeanour punishable with three\r\nmonths’ imprisonment. They were lucky if they ran no graver risk than\r\nthis. Few of the prosecutions at the Special Commissions were under the\r\nAct of 1825. A body of men holding a meeting in a village where famine\r\nand unemployment were chronic, and where hardly any one had been taught\r\nto read or write, might very soon find themselves becoming what the Act\r\nof 1714 called a riotous assembly, and if a magistrate took alarm and\r\nread the Riot Act, and they did not disperse within one hour, every\r\none of them might be punished as a felon. The hour’s interval did not\r\nmean an hour’s grace, for, as Mr. Justice Alderson told the court at\r\nDorchester, within that hour ‘all persons, even private individuals,\r\nmay do anything, using force even to the last extremity to prevent the\r\ncommission of a felony.’\r\n\r\nThere were at least three ways in which labourers meeting together\r\nto demonstrate for higher wages ran a risk of losing their lives, if\r\nany of their fellows got out of hand from temper, or from drink, or\r\nfrom hunger and despair. Most of the prosecutions before the Special\r\nCommissions were prosecutions under three Acts of 1827 and 1828,\r\nconsolidating the law on the subject of offences against property and\r\noffences against the person. Under the eighth section of one Act (7 and\r\n8 George IV. c. 30), any persons riotously or tumultuously assembled\r\ntogether who destroyed any house, stable, coach-house, outhouse, barn,\r\ngranary, or any building or erection or machinery used in carrying\r\non any trade or manufacture were to suffer death as felons. In this\r\nAct there is no definition of riot, and therefore ‘the common law\r\ndefinition of a riot is resorted to, and in such a case if any one of\r\nHis Majesty’s subjects was terrified there was a sufficient terror and\r\nalarm to substantiate that part of the charge.’[449] Under the sixth\r\nsection of another Act, any person who robbed any other person of any\r\nchattel, money, or valuable security was to suffer death as a felon.\r\nNow if a mob presented itself before a householder with a demand for\r\nmoney, and the householder in fear gave even a few coppers, any person\r\nwho was in that mob, whether he had anything to do with this particular\r\ntransaction or not, whether he was aware or ignorant of it, was guilty\r\nof robbery, and liable to the capital penalty. Under section 12 of the\r\nAct of the following year, generally known as Lansdowne’s Act, which\r\namended Ellenborough’s Act of 1803, it was a capital offence to attempt\r\nto shoot at a person, or to stab, cut, or wound him, with intent to\r\nmurder, rob, or maim. Under this Act, as it was interpreted, if an\r\naltercation arose and any violence was offered by a single individual\r\nin the mob, the lives of the whole band were forfeit. This was put\r\nvery clearly by Baron Vaughan: ‘There seems to be some impression that\r\nunless the attack on an individual is made with some deadly weapons,\r\nthose concerned are not liable to capital punishment; but it should\r\nbe made known to all persons that if the same injury were inflicted\r\nby a blow of a stone, all and every person forming part of a riotous\r\nassembly is equally guilty as he whose hand may have thrown it, and\r\nall alike are liable to death.’ Under section 4 of one Act of 1827 the\r\npenalty for destroying a threshing machine was transportation for seven\r\nyears, and under section 17 the penalty for firing a rick was death.\r\nThese were the terrors hanging over the village labourers of whom\r\nseveral hundreds were now awaiting their trial.\r\n\r\nThe temper of the judges was revealed in their charges to the Grand\r\nJuries. In opening the Maidstone Assizes on 14th December, Mr. Justice\r\nBosanquet[450] declared that though there might be some distress it\r\nwas much exaggerated, and that he was sure that those whom he had\r\nthe honour to address would find it not only their duty but their\r\npleasure to lend an ear to the wants of the poor.[451] Mr. Justice\r\nTaunton[452] was even more reassuring on this subject at the Lewes\r\nAssizes: the distress was less than it had been twelve months before.\r\n‘I regret to say,’ he went on, ‘there are persons who exaggerate the\r\ndistress and raise up barriers between different classes--who use the\r\nmost inflammatory language--who represent the rich as oppressors of\r\nthe poor. It would be impertinent in me to say anything to you as to\r\nyour treatment of labourers or servants. That man must know little of\r\nthe gentry of England, whether connected with the town or country,\r\nwho represents them as tyrants to the poor, as not sympathising in\r\ntheir distress, and as not anxious to relieve their burdens and to\r\npromote their welfare and happiness.’[453] In opening the Special\r\nCommission at Winchester Baron Vaughan[454] alluded to the theory that\r\nthe tumults had arisen from distress and admitted that it might be\r\npartly true, but, he continued, ‘every man possessed of the feelings\r\ncommon to our nature must deeply lament it, and endeavour to alleviate\r\nit (as you gentlemen no doubt have done and will continue to do), by\r\nevery means which Providence has put within his power.’ If individuals\r\nwere aggrieved by privations and injuries, they must apply to the\r\nLegislature, which alone could afford them relief, ‘but it can never be\r\ntolerated in any country which professes to acknowledge the obligations\r\nof municipal law, that any man or body of men should be permitted to\r\nsit in judgment upon their own wrongs, or to arrogate to themselves\r\nthe power of redressing them. To suffer it would be to relapse into\r\nthe barbarism of savage life and to dissolve the very elements by\r\nwhich society is held together.’[455] The opinions of the Bench on the\r\nsections of the Act (7 and 8 George IV. c. 30) under which men could\r\nbe hung for assembling riotously and breaking machinery were clearly\r\nexpressed by Mr. Justice Parke[456] (afterwards Lord Wensleydale) at\r\nSalisbury: ‘If that law ceases to be administered with due firmness,\r\nand men look to it in vain for the security of their rights, our wealth\r\nand power will soon be at an end, and our capital and industry would\r\nbe transferred to some more peaceful country, whose laws are more\r\nrespected or better enforced.’[457] By another section of that Act\r\nseven years was fixed as the maximum penalty for breaking a threshing\r\nmachine. Mr. Justice Alderson[458] chafed under this restriction,\r\nand he told two men, Case and Morgan, who were found guilty at the\r\nSalisbury Special Commission of going into a neighbouring parish and\r\nbreaking a threshing machine, that had the Legislature foreseen such\r\ncrimes as theirs, it would have enabled the court to give them a\r\nseverer sentence.[459]\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Park[460] was equally stern and uncompromising in defending\r\nthe property of the followers of the carpenter of Nazareth against the\r\nunreasoning misery of the hour. Summing up in a case at Aylesbury, in\r\nwhich one of the charges was that of attempting to procure a reduction\r\nof tithes, he remarked with warmth: ‘It was highly insolent in such men\r\nto require of gentlemen, who had by an expensive education qualified\r\nthemselves to discharge the sacred duties of a Minister of the Gospel,\r\nto descend from that station and reduce themselves to the situation of\r\ncommon labourers.’[461]\r\n\r\nFew judges could resist the temptation to introduce into their charges\r\na homily on the economic benefits of machinery. Mr. Justice Park was\r\nan exception, for he observed at Aylesbury that the question of the\r\nadvantages of machinery was outside the province of the judges, ‘and\r\nmuch mischief often resulted from persons stepping out of their line\r\nof duty.’[462] Mr. Justice Alderson took a different view, and the\r\nvery next day he was expounding the truths of political economy at\r\nDorchester, starting with what he termed the ‘beautiful and simple\r\nillustration’ of the printing press.[463] The illustration must have\r\nseemed singularly intimate and convincing to the labourers in the dock\r\nwho had never been taught their letters.\r\n\r\nSuch was the temper of the judges. Who and what were the prisoners\r\nbefore them? After the suppression of the riots, the magistrates could\r\npick out culprits at their leisure, and when a riot had involved the\r\nwhole of the village the temptation to get rid by this method of\r\npersons who for one reason or another were obnoxious to the authorities\r\nwas irresistible. Hunt, speaking in the House of Commons,[464] quoted\r\nthe case of Hindon; seven men had been apprehended for rioting and they\r\nwere all poachers. Many of the prisoners had already spent a month in\r\nan overcrowded prison; almost all of them were poor men; the majority\r\ncould not read or write.[465] Few could afford counsel, and it must\r\nbe remembered that counsel could not address the court on behalf of\r\nprisoners who were being tried for breaking machines, or for belonging\r\nto a mob that asked for money or destroyed property. By the rules of\r\nthe gaol, the prisoners at Salisbury were not allowed to see their\r\nattorney except in the presence of the gaoler or his servant. The\r\nlabourers’ ignorance of the law was complete and inevitable. Many of\r\nthem thought that the King or the Government or the magistrates had\r\ngiven orders that machines were to be broken. Most of them supposed\r\nthat if a person from whom they demanded money threw it down or gave\r\nit without the application of physical force, there was no question\r\nof robbery. We have an illustration of this illusion in a trial at\r\nWinchester when Isaac Hill, junior, who was charged with breaking a\r\nthreshing machine near Micheldever, for which the maximum penalty was\r\nseven years, pleaded in his defence that he had not broken the machine\r\nand that all that he did ‘was to ask the prosecutor civilly for the\r\nmoney, which the mob took from him, and the prosecutor gave it to him,\r\nand that he thanked him very kindly for it,’[466] an admission which\r\nmade him liable to a death penalty. A prisoner at Salisbury, when he\r\nwas asked what he had to say in his defence to the jury, replied:\r\n‘Now, my Lord, I ‘se got nothing to say to ’em, I doant knaow any on\r\n’em.’[467] The prisoners were at this further disadvantage that all\r\nthe witnesses whom they could call as to their share in the conduct\r\nof a mob had themselves been in the mob, and were thus liable to\r\nprosecution. Thus when James Lush (who was afterwards selected for\r\nexecution) and James Toomer appealed to a man named Lane, who had just\r\nbeen acquitted on a previous charge, to give evidence that they had\r\nnot struck Mr. Pinniger in a scuffle, Mr. Justice Alderson cautioned\r\nLane that if he acknowledged that he had been in the mob he would be\r\ncommitted. Lane chose the safer part of silence.[468] In another case a\r\nwitness had the courage to incriminate himself. When the brothers Simms\r\nwere being tried for extorting money from Parson Easton’s wife, a case\r\nwhich we have already described, Henry Bunce, called as a witness for\r\nthe defence, voluntarily declared, in spite of a caution from the judge\r\n(Alderson), that he had been present himself and that William Simms did\r\nnot use the expression ‘blood or money.’ He was at once ordered into\r\ncustody. ‘The prisoner immediately sprung over the bar into the dock\r\nwith his former comrades, seemingly unaffected by the decision of the\r\nlearned judge.’[469]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the darkest side of the business was the temptation held\r\nout to prisoners awaiting trial to betray their comrades. Immunity\r\nor a lighter sentence was freely offered to those who would give\r\nevidence. Stokes, who was found guilty at Dorchester of breaking a\r\nthreshing machine, was sentenced by Mr. Justice Alderson to a year’s\r\nimprisonment, with the explanation that he was not transported\r\nbecause ‘after you were taken into custody, you gave very valuable\r\ninformation which tended greatly to further the ends of justice.’[470]\r\nThese transactions were not often dragged into the daylight, but\r\nsome negotiations of this character were made public in the trial of\r\nMr. Deacle next year. Mr. Deacle, a well-to-do gentleman farmer, was\r\ntried at the Lent Assizes at Winchester for being concerned in the\r\nriots. One of the witnesses against him, named Collins, admitted in\r\ncross-examination that he believed he should have been prosecuted\r\nhimself, if he had not promised to give evidence against Mr. Deacle;\r\nanother witness, named Barnes, a carpenter, stated in cross-examination\r\nthat during the trials at the Special Commission, ‘he being in the\r\ndock, and about to be put on his trial, the gaoler Beckett called\r\nhim out, and took him into a room where there were Walter Long, a\r\nmagistrate, and another person, whom he believed to be Bingham Baring,\r\nwho told him that he should not be put upon his trial if he would\r\ncome and swear against Deacle.’ When the next witness was about to be\r\ncross-examined, the counsel for the prosecution abruptly abandoned the\r\ncase.[471]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first Special Commission was opened at Winchester with suitable\r\npomp on 18th December. Not only the prison but the whole town was\r\ncrowded, and the inhabitants of Winchester determined to make the best\r\nof the windfall. The jurymen and the _Times_ special correspondent\r\ncomplained bitterly of the abnormal cost of living, the latter\r\nmentioning that in addition to extraordinary charges for beds, 5s.\r\na day was exacted for firing and tallow candles, bedroom fire not\r\nincluded. The three judges sent down as commissioners were Baron\r\nVaughan, Mr. Justice Parke, and Mr. Justice Alderson. With them were\r\nassociated two other commissioners, Mr. Sturges Bourne, of assistant\r\noverseer fame, and Mr. Richard Pollen. The Duke of Wellington, as\r\nLord-Lieutenant, sat on the Bench. The Attorney-General, Mr. Sergeant\r\nWilde, and others appeared to prosecute for the Crown. The County took\r\nup every charge, the Government only the more serious ones.\r\n\r\nThere were three hundred prisoners, most of them charged with extorting\r\nmoney by threats or with breaking machinery. What chance had they of a\r\nfair trial? They started with the disabilities already described. They\r\nwere thrown by batches into the dock; the pitiless law was explained\r\nto the jury; extenuating circumstances were ruled out as irrelevant.\r\n‘We do not come here,’ said Mr. Justice Alderson, ‘to inquire into\r\ngrievances. We come here to decide law.’ But though evidence about\r\nwages or distress was not admitted, the judges did not scruple to give\r\ntheir own views of the social conditions which had produced these\r\ndisturbances. Perhaps the most flagrant example was provided by a trial\r\nwhich happily was for a misdemeanour only. Seven men were indicted\r\nfor conspiring together and riotously assembling for the purpose of\r\nraising wages and for compelling others to join them. The labourers of\r\nthe parish of Fawley had combined together for two objects, the first\r\nto raise their wages, which stood at 9s. a week, the second to get rid\r\nof the assistant overseer, who had introduced a parish cart, to which\r\nhe had harnessed women and boys, amongst others an idiot woman, named\r\nJane Stevens. The labourers determined to break up the cart, but they\r\ndesisted on the promise of a farmer that a horse should be bought for\r\nit. Lord Cavan was the large landowner of the parish. He paid his men\r\nas a rule 9s. a week, but two of them received 10s. The mob came up to\r\nhis house to demand an increase of wages: Lord Cavan was out, quelling\r\nrioters elsewhere. Lady Cavan came down to see them. ‘Seeing you are my\r\nneighbours and armed,’ said she, ‘yet, as I am an unprotected woman,\r\nI am sure you will do no harm.’ The labourers protested that they\r\nmeant no harm, and they did no harm. ‘I asked them,’ said Lady Cavan\r\nafterwards, in evidence, ‘why they rose then, there was no apparent\r\ndistress round Eaglehurst, and the wages were the same as they had been\r\nfor several years. I have been in several of their cottages and never\r\nsaw any appearance of distress. They said they had been oppressed long\r\nand would bear it no longer.’ One man told her that he had 9s. a week\r\nwages and 3s. from the parish, he had heard that the 3s. was to be\r\ndiscontinued. With the common-sense characteristic of her class Lady\r\nCavan assured him that he was not improving his position by idling.\r\nThe labourers impressed the Cavan men, and went on their peaceful way\r\nround the parish. The farmers who gave evidence for the prosecution\r\nwere allowed to assert that there was no distress, but when it came to\r\nevidence for the defence a stricter standard of relevancy was exacted.\r\nOne witness for the prisoners said of the labourers: ‘The men were in\r\nvery great distress; many of the men had only a few potatoes in their\r\nbag when they came to work.’ ‘The learned judges objected to this\r\ncourse of examination being continued: it might happen that through\r\ndrinking a man might suffer distress.’ The Attorney-General, in his\r\nclosing speech, asserted again that the prisoners did not seem to have\r\nbeen in distress. Baron Vaughan, in summing up, said that men were not\r\nto assemble and conspire together for the purpose of determining what\r\ntheir wages should be. ‘That which at first might be in itself a lawful\r\nact, might in the event become illegal.... A respectful statement or\r\nrepresentation of their grievances was legal, and to which no one would\r\nobject, but the evidence, if they believed it, showed that the conduct\r\nof this assembly was far from being respectful. No one could feel more\r\nfor the distresses of the people than he did, but he would never endure\r\nthat persons should by physical strength compel wages to be raised.\r\nThere was no country where charity fell in a purer stream than in\r\nthis. Let the man make his appeal in a proper and respectful manner,\r\nand he might be assured that appeal would never be heard in vain....\r\nHis Lordship spoke very highly of the conduct of Lady Cavan. She had\r\nvisited the cottages of all those who lived in the neighbourhood, she\r\nknew they were not distressed, and she also felt confident from her\r\nkindness to them that they would not offer her any violence.’ All seven\r\nwere found guilty; four were sentenced to six months hard labour, and\r\nthree to three months.\r\n\r\nVery few, however, of the cases at Winchester were simple\r\nmisdemeanours, for in most instances, in addition to asking for higher\r\nwages, the labourers had made themselves liable to a prosecution for\r\nfelony, either by breaking a threshing machine or by asking for money.\r\nThose prisoners who had taken part in the Fordingbridge riots, or in\r\nthe destruction of machinery near Andover, or in the demolition of\r\nthe Headley Workhouse, were sentenced to death or to transportation\r\nfor life. Case after case was tried in which prisoners from different\r\nvillages were indicted for assault and robbery. The features varied\r\nlittle, and the spectators began to find the proceedings monotonous.\r\nMost of the agricultural population of Hampshire had made itself liable\r\nto the death penalty, if the authorities cared to draw the noose. The\r\nthree hundred who actually appeared in Court were like the men on whom\r\nthe tower of Siloam fell.\r\n\r\nA case to which the prosecution attached special importance arose out\r\nof an affair at the house of Mr. Eyre Coote. A mob of forty persons,\r\nsome of whom had iron bars, presented themselves before Mr. Coote’s\r\ndoor at two o’clock in the morning. Two bands of men had already\r\nvisited Mr. Coote that evening, and he had given them beer: this third\r\nband was a party of stragglers. Mr. Coote stationed his ten servants\r\nin the portico, and when the mob arrived he asked them, ‘What do you\r\nwant, my lads?’ ‘Money,’ was the answer. ‘Money,’ said Mr. Coote, ‘you\r\nshan’t have.’ One of the band seemed to Mr. Coote about to strike him.\r\nMr. Coote seized him, nine of the mob were knocked down and taken, and\r\nthe rest fled. Six of the men were prosecuted for feloniously demanding\r\nmoney. Baron Vaughan remarked that outrages like this made one wonder\r\nwhether one was in a civilised country, and he proceeded to raise its\r\nmoral tone by sentencing all the prisoners to transportation for life,\r\nexcept one, Henry Eldridge, who was reserved for execution. He had\r\nbeen already capitally convicted of complicity in the Fordingbridge\r\nriots, and this attempt to ‘enter the sanctuary of Mr. Eyre Coote’s\r\nhome’ following upon that crime, rendered him a suitable ‘sacrifice to\r\nbe made on the altar of the offended justice’ of his country.\r\n\r\nIn many of the so-called robberies punished by the Special Commissions\r\nthe sums taken were trifling. George Steel, aged eighteen, was\r\nsentenced to transportation for life for obtaining a shilling, when\r\nhe was in liquor, from Jane Neale: William Sutton, another boy of\r\neighteen, was found guilty of taking 4d. in a drunken frolic: Sutton,\r\nwho was a carter boy receiving 1s. 6d. a week and his food, was given\r\nan excellent character by his master, who declared that he had never\r\nhad a better servant. The jury recommended him to mercy, and the judges\r\nresponded by sentencing him to death and banishing him for life. George\r\nClerk, aged twenty, and E. C. Nutbean, aged eighteen, paid the same\r\nprice for 3d. down and the promise of beer at the Greyhound. Such cases\r\nwere not exceptional, as any one who turns to the reports of the trials\r\nwill see.\r\n\r\nThe evidence on which prisoners were convicted was often of the most\r\nshadowy kind. Eight young agricultural labourers, of ages varying from\r\neighteen to twenty-five, were found guilty of riotously assembling\r\nin the parish of St. Lawrence Wootten and feloniously stealing £2\r\nfrom William Lutely Sclater of Tangier Park. ‘We want to get a little\r\nsatisfaction from you’ was the phrase they used. Two days later another\r\nman, named William Farmer, was charged with the same offence. Mr.\r\nSclater thought that Farmer was like the man in the mob who blew a\r\ntrumpet or horn, but could not swear to his identity. Other witnesses\r\nswore that he was with the mob elsewhere, and said, ‘Money wa want and\r\nmoney wa will hae.’ On this evidence he was found guilty, and though\r\nMr. Justice Alderson announced that he felt warranted in recommending\r\nthat he should not lose his life, ‘yet, it was his duty,’ he continued,\r\n‘to state that he should for this violent and disgraceful outrage be\r\nsent out of the country, and separated for life from those friends and\r\nconnections which were dear to him here: that he should have to employ\r\nthe rest of his days in labour, at the will and for the profit of\r\nanother, to show the people of the class to which the prisoner belonged\r\nthat they cannot with impunity lend their aid to such outrages against\r\nthe peace and security of person and property.’\r\n\r\nWe have seen that at the time of the riots it was freely stated\r\nthat the farmers incited the labourers to make disturbances. Hunt\r\nwent so far as to say in the House of Commons that in nineteen\r\ncases out of twenty the farmers encouraged the labourers to break\r\nthe threshing machines. The county authorities evidently thought it\r\nunwise to prosecute the farmers, although it was proved in evidence\r\nthat there were several farmers present at the destruction of the\r\nHeadley Workhouse, and at the demonstration at Mr. Cobbold’s house.\r\nOccasionally a farmer, in testifying to a prisoner’s character, would\r\nadmit that he had been in a mob himself. In such cases the judge\r\nadministered rebukes, but the prosecution took no action. There was,\r\nhowever, one exception. A small farmer, John Boys, of the parish of\r\nOwslebury, had thrown himself heartily into the labourers’ cause. A\r\nnumber of small farmers met and decided that the labourers’ wages\r\nought to be raised. Boys agreed to take a paper round for signature.\r\nThe paper ran as follows: ‘We the undersigned are willing to give 2s.\r\nper day for able-bodied married men, and 9s. per week for single men,\r\non consideration of our rents and tithes being abated in proportion.’\r\nIn similar cases, as a rule, the farmers left it to the labourers to\r\ncollect signatures, and Boys, by undertaking the work himself, made\r\nhimself a marked man. He had been in a mob which extorted money from\r\nLord Northesk’s steward at Owslebury, and for this he was indicted for\r\nfelony. But the jury, to the chagrin of the prosecution, acquitted\r\nhim. What followed is best described in the report of Sergeant Wilde’s\r\nspeech in the House of Commons (21st July 1831). ‘Boyce was tried\r\nand acquitted: but he (Mr. Wilde) being unable to account for the\r\nacquittal, considering the evidence to have been clear against him,\r\nand feeling that although the jury were most respectable men, they\r\nmight possibly entertain some sympathy for him in consequence of his\r\nsituation in life, thought it his duty to send a communication to the\r\nAttorney-General, stating that Boyce was deeply responsible for the\r\nacts which had taken place: that he thought he should not be allowed to\r\nescape, and recommending that he be tried before a different jury in\r\nthe other Court. The Attorney-General sent to him (Mr. Wilde) to come\r\ninto the other Court, and the result was that Boyce was then tried and\r\nconvicted.’ In the other more complaisant Court, Farmer Boys and James\r\nFussell, described as a genteel young man of about twenty, living with\r\nhis mother, were found guilty of heading a riotous mob for reducing\r\nrents and tithes and sentenced to seven years’ transportation.[472]\r\n\r\nThis was not the only case in which the sympathies of the jury created\r\na difficulty. The Home Office Papers contain a letter from Dr.\r\nQuarrier, a Hampshire magistrate, who had been particularly vigorous in\r\nsuppressing riots, stating that Sir James Parke discharged a jury at\r\nthe Special Commission ‘under the impression that they were reluctant\r\nto convict the Prisoners which was more strongly impressed upon the\r\nmind of the Judge, by its being reported to his Lordship that “some of\r\nthe Gosport Jurors had said, while travelling in the stage coach to\r\nWinchester, that they would not convict in cases where the Labourers\r\nhad been driven to excess by Poverty and low Wages!” It was ascertained\r\nthat some of those empannelled upon the acquitting Jury were from\r\nGosport, which confirmed the learned Judge in the determination to\r\ndischarge them.’[473]\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of the trials at Winchester was the number of\r\nmen just above the condition of agricultural labourers who threw in\r\ntheir lot with the poor: the village mechanics, the wheelwrights,\r\ncarpenters, joiners, smiths, and the bricklayers, shoemakers, shepherds\r\nand small holders were often prominent in the disturbances. To the\r\njudges this fact was a riddle. The threshing machines had done these\r\nmen no injury; they had not known the sting of hunger; till the time\r\nof the riots their characters had been as a rule irreproachable.\r\n_Nemo repente turpissimus fuit_, and yet apparently these persons had\r\nsuddenly, without warning, turned into the ‘wicked and turbulent men’\r\nof the archbishop’s prayer. Such culprits deserved, in the opinions\r\nof the bench, severer punishment than the labourers, whom their\r\nexample should have kept in the paths of obedience and peace.[474]\r\nWhere the law permitted, they were sentenced to transportation for\r\nlife. One heinous offender of this type, Gregory, a carpenter, was\r\nactually earning 18s. a week in the service of Lord Winchester. But\r\nthe most interesting instances were two brothers, Joseph and Robert\r\nMason, who lived at Bullington. They rented three or four acres, kept\r\na cow, and worked for the neighbouring farmers as well. Joseph, who\r\nwas thirty-two, had a wife and one child; Robert, who was twenty-four,\r\nwas unmarried. Between them they supported a widowed mother. Their\r\ncharacters were exemplary, and the most eager malice could detect no\r\nblot upon their past. But their opinions were dangerous: they regularly\r\ntook in Cobbett’s _Register_ and read it aloud to twenty or thirty\r\nof the villagers. Further, Joseph had carried on foot a petition\r\nfor reform to the king at Brighton from a hundred and seventy-seven\r\n‘persons, belonging to the working and labouring classes’ of Wonston,\r\nBarton Stacey and Bullington, and was reported to have given some\r\ntrouble to the king’s porter by an importunate demand for an audience.\r\nThe recital of these facts gave rise to much merriment at his trial,\r\nand was not considered irrelevant by judges who ruled out all allusions\r\nto distress.[475] An interesting light is thrown on the history of\r\nthis petition by a fragment of a letter, written by Robert Mason to\r\na friend, which somehow fell into the hands of a Captain Thompson of\r\nLongparish, and was forwarded by him to the Home Office as a valuable\r\npiece of evidence.\r\n\r\n ‘_P.S._--Since I wrote the above I have saw and talked with two\r\n persons who say “Bullington Barton and Sutton has sent a petition and\r\n why not Longparish Hursborne and Wherwell send another.” I think as\r\n much, to be sure if we had all signed one, one journey and expense\r\n would have served but what is expence? Why I would engage to carry a\r\n Petition and deliver it at St. James for 30 shillings, and to a place\r\n like Longparish what is that? If you do send one pray do not let\r\n Church property escape your notice. There is the Church which cost\r\n Longparish I should think nearly £1500 yearly: yes and there is an old\r\n established Chaple which I will be bound does not cost £25 annually.\r\n For God sake....’ (illegible).\r\n\r\nThe first charge brought against the Masons was that of robbing Sir\r\nThomas Baring’s steward of £10 at East Stretton. The money had been\r\ntaken by one of the mobs; the Masons were acquitted. They were next\r\nput on their trial together with William Winkworth, a cobbler and a\r\nfellow reader of Cobbett, and ten others, for a similar offence. This\r\ntime they were accused of demanding £2 or £5 from Mr. W. Dowden of\r\nMicheldever. The Attorney-General, in opening the case, drew attention\r\nto the circumstances of the Masons and Winkworth, saying that the\r\noffence with which they were charged was of a deeper dye, because they\r\nwere men of superior education and intelligence. A humane clergyman,\r\nMr. Cockerton, curate of Stoke Cheriton, gave evidence to the effect\r\nthat if the men had been met in a conciliatory temper in the morning\r\nthey would have dispersed. Joseph Mason and William Winkworth were\r\nfound guilty, and sentenced, in the words of the judge, to ‘be cut off\r\nfrom all communion with society’ for the rest of their lives. Robert\r\nMason was still unconvicted, but he was not allowed to escape. The next\r\ncharge against him was that of going with a mob which extorted five\r\nshillings from the Rev. J. Joliffe at Barton Stacey. He admitted that\r\nhe had accompanied the mob, partly because the labourers had urged him\r\nto do so, partly because he hoped that Mr. Joliffe, being accustomed to\r\npublic speaking, would be able to persuade the labourers to disperse\r\nbefore any harm was done. There was no evidence to show that he had\r\nanything to do with the demand for money. He was found guilty and\r\nsentenced to transportation for life. When asked what he had to say\r\nfor himself, he replied, ‘If the learned Counsel, who has so painted\r\nmy conduct to you, was present at that place and wore a smock frock\r\ninstead of a gown, and a straw hat instead of a wig, he would now be\r\nstanding in this dock instead of being seated where he is.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSix men were reserved for execution, and told that they must expect\r\nno mercy on this side of the grave: Cooper, the leader in the\r\nFordingbridge riots; Holdaway, who had headed the attack on Headley\r\nWorkhouse; Gilmore, who had entered the justices’ room in Andover\r\n‘in rather a violent manner’ and parleyed with the justices, and\r\nafterwards, in spite of their remonstrances, been a ringleader in the\r\ndestruction of a foundry in the parish of Upper Clatford; Eldridge,\r\nwho had taken part in the Fordingbridge riot and also ‘invaded the\r\nsanctuary’ of Mr. Eyre Coote’s home; James Aunalls, a lad of nineteen,\r\nwho had extorted money at night with threats of a fire, from a person\r\nwhom he bade look over the hills, where a fire was subsequently seen,\r\nand Henry Cook. Cook was a ploughboy of nineteen, who could neither\r\nread nor write. For most of his life, since the age of ten, he had\r\nbeen a farm hand. For six months before the riots he had been employed\r\nat sawing, at 10s. a week, but at the time of the rising he was out\r\nof work. After the riots he got work as a ploughboy at about 5s. a\r\nweek till his arrest. Like the other lads of the neighbourhood he had\r\ngone round with a mob, and he was found guilty, with Joseph Mason, of\r\nextorting money from William Dowden. For this he might have got off\r\nwith transportation for life, but another charge was preferred against\r\nhim. Mr. William Bingham Baring, J.P., tried, with the help of some\r\nof his servants, to quell a riot at Northingdon Down Farm. Silcock,\r\nwho seemed the leader of the rioters, declared that they would break\r\nevery machine. Bingham Baring made Silcock repeat these words several\r\ntimes and then seized him. Cook then aimed a blow at Bingham Baring\r\nwith a sledge-hammer and struck his hat. So far there was no dispute\r\nas to what had happened. One servant of the Barings gave evidence to\r\nthe effect that he had saved his master’s life by preventing Cook from\r\nstriking again; another afterwards put in a sworn deposition to the\r\neffect that Cook never attempted to strike a second blow. All witnesses\r\nagreed that Bingham Baring’s hat had suffered severely: some of them\r\nsaid that he himself had been felled to the ground. Whatever his\r\ninjuries may have been, he was seen out a few hours later, apparently\r\nin perfect health; next day he was walking the streets of Winchester;\r\ntwo days later he was presented at Court, and within a week he was\r\nstrong enough to administer a sharp blow himself with his stick to a\r\nhandcuffed and unconvicted prisoner, a display of zeal for which he had\r\nto pay £50. Cook did not put up any defence. He was sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was felt that this victim to justice was in some respects\r\nill chosen, for reasons for severity were soon invented. He was a\r\nheavy, stolid, unattractive boy, and his appearance was taken to\r\nindicate a brutal and vicious disposition. Stories of his cruelties\r\nto animals were spread abroad. ‘The fate of Henry Cook,’ said the\r\n_Times_ correspondent (3rd January 1831), ‘excites no commiseration.\r\nFrom everything I have heard of him, justice has seldom met with a\r\nmore appropriate sacrifice. He shed some tears shortly after hearing\r\nhis doom, but has since relapsed into a brutal insensibility to his\r\nfate.’ His age was raised to thirty, his wages to 30s. a week. Denman\r\ndescribed him in the House of Commons, after his execution, as a\r\ncarpenter earning 30s. a week, who had struck down one of the family of\r\nhis benefactor, and had only been prevented from killing his victim by\r\nthe interposition of a more faithful individual. This is the epitaph\r\nwritten on this obscure ploughboy of nineteen by the upper classes.\r\nHis own fellows, who probably knew him at least as well as a Denman\r\nor a Baring, regarded his punishment as murder. Cobbett tells us that\r\nthe labourers of Micheldever subscribed their pennies to get Denman’s\r\nmisstatements about Cook taken out of the newspapers. When his body was\r\nbrought home after execution, the whole parish went out to meet it, and\r\nhe was buried in Micheldever churchyard in solemn silence.\r\n\r\nBingham Baring himself, as has been mentioned, happened to offend\r\nagainst the law by an act of violence at this time. He was not like\r\nCook, a starving boy, but the son of a man who was reputed to have made\r\nseven millions of money, and was called by Erskine the first merchant\r\nin Europe. He did not strike his victim in a riot, but in cold blood.\r\nHis victim could not defend himself, for he was handcuffed, being taken\r\nto prison on a charge on which he was subsequently acquitted. The man\r\nstruck was a Mr. Deacle, a small farmer who had had his own threshing\r\nmachine broken, and was afterwards arrested with his wife, by Bingham\r\nBaring and a posse of magistrates, on suspicion of encouraging the\r\nrioters. Deacle’s story was that Baring and the other magistrates\r\nconcerned in the arrest treated his wife with great insolence in the\r\ncart in which they drove the Deacles to prison, and that Bingham Baring\r\nfurther struck him with a stick. For this Deacle got £50 damages in an\r\naction he brought against Baring. ‘This verdict,’ said the _Morning\r\nHerald_, ‘seemed to excite the greatest astonishment; for most of the\r\nBar and almost every one in Court said, if on the jury, they would have\r\ngiven at least £5000 for so gross and wanton an insult and unfeeling\r\nconduct towards those who had not offered the least resistance; the\r\ndefendants not addressing the slightest evidence in palliation or\r\nattempting to justify it.’ The judge, in summing up, ‘could not help\r\nremarking that the handcuffing was, to say the least of it, a very\r\nharsh proceeding towards a lady and gentleman who had been perfectly\r\ncivil and quiet.’ Meanwhile the case of the magistrates against the\r\nDeacles had collapsed in the most inglorious manner. Though they had\r\nhandcuffed these two unresisting people, they had thought it wiser\r\nnot to proceed against them. Deacle, however, insisted on being tried,\r\nand by threatening the magistrates with an action, he obliged them\r\nto prosecute. He was tried at the Assizes, and, as we have seen, the\r\ntrial came to an abrupt conclusion under circumstances that threw the\r\ngravest suspicion on the methods of the authorities.[476] Meanwhile\r\nthe treatment these two persons had received (and we can imagine from\r\ntheir story how innocent poor people, without friends or position,\r\nwere handled) had excited great indignation, and the newspapers were\r\nfull of it. There were petitions sent up to Parliament for a Committee\r\nof Inquiry. Now the class to which Cook was unlucky enough to belong\r\nhad never sent a single member to Parliament, but the Baring family\r\nhad five Members in the House of Commons at this very moment, one of\r\nwhom had taken part with Bingham Baring in the violent arrest of the\r\nDeacles. The five, moreover, were very happily distributed, one of them\r\nbeing Junior Lord of the Treasury in Grey’s Government and husband\r\nof Grey’s niece, and another an important member of the Opposition\r\nand afterwards Chancellor of the Exchequer under Peel. The Barings\r\ntherefore were in less danger of misrepresentation or misunderstanding;\r\nthe motion for a Committee was rejected by a great majority on the\r\nadvice of Althorp and Peel; the leader of the House of Commons came\r\nforward to testify that the Barings were friends of his, and the\r\ndiscussion ended in a chorus of praise for the family that had been\r\njudged so harshly outside the walls of Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhen the Special Commission had finished its labours at Winchester,\r\n101 prisoners had been capitally convicted; of these 6 were left for\r\nexecution. The remaining 95 were, with few exceptions, transported for\r\nlife. Of the other prisoners tried, 36 were sentenced to transportation\r\nfor various periods, 65 were imprisoned with hard labour, and 67 were\r\nacquitted. Not a single life had been taken by the rioters, not a\r\nsingle person wounded. Yet the riots in this county alone were punished\r\nby more than a hundred capital convictions, or almost double the number\r\nthat followed the devilish doings of Lord George Gordon’s mob. The\r\nspirit in which Denman regarded the proceedings is illustrated by his\r\nspeech in the House of Commons on the amnesty debate: ‘No fewer than\r\na hundred persons were capitally convicted at Winchester, of offences\r\nfor every one of which their lives might have been justly taken,\r\nand ought to have been taken, if examples to such an extent had been\r\nnecessary.’[477]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese sentences came like a thunderclap on the people of Winchester,\r\nand all classes, except the magistrates, joined in petitions to the\r\nGovernment for mercy. The _Times_ correspondent wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n  ‘WINCHESTER, Friday Morning, _7th Jan._\r\n\r\n ‘The scenes of distress in and about the jail are most terrible. The\r\n number of men who are to be torn from their homes and connexions is so\r\n great that there is scarcely a hamlet in the county into which anguish\r\n and tribulation have not entered. Wives, sisters, mothers, children,\r\n beset the gates daily, and the governor of the jail informs me that\r\n the scenes he is obliged to witness at the time of locking up the\r\n prison are truly heart-breaking.\r\n\r\n ‘You will have heard before this of the petitions which have been\r\n presented to the Home Office from Gosport, Portsmouth, Romsey,\r\n Whitchurch, and Basingstoke, praying for an extension of mercy to\r\n all the men who now lie under sentence of death. A similar petition\r\n has been got up in this city. It is signed by the clergy of the Low\r\n Church, some of the bankers, and every tradesman in the town without\r\n exception. Application was made to the clergy of the Cathedral for\r\n their signatures, but they refused to give them, except conditionally,\r\n upon reasons which I cannot comprehend. They told the petitioners,\r\n as I am informed, that they would not sign any such petition unless\r\n the grand jury and the magistracy of the county previously affixed\r\n their names to it. Now such an answer, as it appears to me, is an\r\n admission on their part that no mischief would ensue from not carrying\r\n into effect the dreadful sentence of the law; for I cannot conceive\r\n that if they were of opinion that mischief would ensue from it, they\r\n would sign the petition, even though it were recommended by all the\r\n talent and respectability of the Court of Quarter Sessions. I can\r\n understand the principles on which that man acts, who asserts and\r\n laments the necessity of vindicating the majesty of the law by the\r\n sacrifice of human life; but I cannot understand the reasons of those\r\n who, admitting that there is no necessity for the sword of justice to\r\n strike the offender, decline to call upon the executive government to\r\n stay its arm, and make their application for its mercy dependent on\r\n the judgment, or it may be the caprice, of an influential aristocracy.\r\n Surely, of all classes of society, the clergy is that which ought not\r\n to be backward in the remission of offences. They are daily preaching\r\n mercy to their flocks, and it wears but an ill grace when they are\r\n seen refusing their consent to a practical application of their own\r\n doctrines. Whatever my own opinion may be, as a faithful recorder\r\n of the opinions of those around me, I am bound to inform you, that,\r\n except among the magistracy of the county, there is a general, I had\r\n almost said a universal, opinion among all ranks of society, that no\r\n good will be effected by sacrificing human life.’[478]\r\n\r\nThis outburst of public opinion saved the lives of four of the six men\r\nwho had been left for execution. The two who were hung were Cooper\r\nand Cook. But the Government and the judges were determined that the\r\nlessons of civilisation should not be wanting in impressiveness or in\r\ndignity. They compelled all the prisoners who had been condemned by\r\nthe Commission to witness the last agonies of the two men whom public\r\nopinion had been unable to rescue. The account given in the _Times_\r\nof 17th January shows that this piece of refined and spectacular\r\ndiscipline was not thrown away, and that the wretched comrades of\r\nthe men who were hanged suffered as acutely as Denman or Alderson\r\nthemselves could have desired. ‘At this moment I cast my eyes down\r\ninto the felons’ yard, and saw many of the convicts weeping bitterly,\r\nsome burying their faces in their smock frocks, others wringing their\r\nhands convulsively, and others leaning for support against the wall\r\nof the yard and unable to cast their eyes upwards.’ This was the last\r\nvision of English justice that each labourer carried to his distant\r\nand dreaded servitude, a scene that would never fade from his mind.\r\nThere was much that England had not taught him. She had not taught him\r\nthat the rich owed a duty to the poor, that society owed any shelter\r\nto the freedom or the property of the weak, that the mere labourer\r\nhad a share in the State, or a right to be considered in its laws, or\r\nthat it mattered to his rulers in what wretchedness he lived or in\r\nwhat wretchedness he died. But one lesson she had taught him with such\r\nsavage power that his simple memory would not forget it, and if ever\r\nin an exile’s gilding dreams he thought with longing of his boyhood’s\r\nfamine-shadowed home, that inexorable dawn would break again before\r\nhis shrinking eyes and he would thank God for the wide wastes of the\r\nillimitable sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Special Commission for Wiltshire opened at Salisbury on 2nd\r\nJanuary 1831. The judges were the same as those at Winchester; the\r\nother commissioners were Lord Radnor, the friend of Cobbett, and Mr. T.\r\nG. B. Estcourt. Lord Lansdowne, the Lord-Lieutenant, sat on the bench.\r\nThe foreman of the Grand Jury was Mr. John Benett, who has already\r\nfigured in these pages as the proprietor whose property was destroyed\r\nand the magistrate who committed the culprits. There were three hundred\r\nprisoners awaiting trial.\r\n\r\nThe method in which the prosecutions were conducted in Wiltshire,\r\nthough it did not differ from the procedure followed in Hampshire and\r\nelsewhere, provoked some criticism from the lawyers. The prosecutions\r\nwere all managed by the county authorities. The clerks of the\r\ncommitting magistrates in the different districts first took the\r\ndepositions, and then got up all the prosecutions in their capacity of\r\nsolicitors to the same magistrates prosecuting as county authorities,\r\nto the exclusion of the solicitors of the individual prosecutors.\r\nFurther, all the prosecutions were managed for the county by a single\r\nbarrister, who assisted the Attorney-General and left no opening for\r\nother members of the Bar. The counsel for one of the prisoners objected\r\nto this method, not only on the ground of its unfairness to the legal\r\nprofession, but on the wider ground of the interests of justice. For\r\nit was inconsistent with the impartiality required from magistrates\r\nwho committed prisoners, that they should go on to mix themselves up\r\nwith the management of the prosecution; in many cases these magistrates\r\nserved again as grand jurors in the proceedings against the prisoners.\r\nSuch procedure, he argued ‘was calculated to throw at least a strong\r\nsuspicion on the fair administration of justice.’ These protests,\r\nhowever, were silenced by the judges, and though the Attorney-General\r\nannounced that he was willing that the counsel for the magistrates\r\nshould retire, no change was made in the arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe Salisbury prisoners were under a further disadvantage peculiar,\r\nit is to be hoped, to that gaol. They were forbidden to see their\r\nattorney except in the presence of the gaoler or his servants. This\r\nrule seems to have been construed by the authorities in a manner that\r\nsimplified considerably the task of the prosecution. The facts of the\r\ncase of James Lush, condemned to death on two charges of extorting\r\nmoney in a mob, were made public by Hunt in a letter to the _Times_,\r\n22nd January 1831. Lush was a very poor man, but when first committed\r\nhe sent for an attorney and made a full confession. ‘This confession,\r\nso confidentially made to his attorney (by an extraordinary rule of\r\nthe gaol) the legal adviser was compelled to submit to the inspection\r\nof the gaoler, which paper he kept in his hands for several days and\r\nin all human probability, this document, or a copy of it, was either\r\nsubmitted to the inspection of the judge, or placed in the hands of\r\nthe prosecutor, the Crown Solicitor, or the Attorney-General: when\r\nthis man was called up for trial, such was his extreme poverty, that\r\nhe could not raise a guinea to fee counsel, and he was left destitute,\r\nwithout legal advice or assistance.’ The Attorney-General could only\r\nanswer this charge in the House of Commons by declaring that he had no\r\nrecollection of any such circumstance himself, and that no gentleman of\r\nthe Bar would avail himself of information obtained in such a manner.\r\nLush could not distinguish these niceties of honour, or understand why\r\nhis confession should be examined and kept by the gaoler unless it\r\nwas to be used against him, and it is not surprising that he thought\r\nhimself betrayed. It is only fair to Lord Melbourne to add that when\r\nHunt drew his attention to this iniquitous rule in Salisbury Gaol he\r\nhad it abolished.\r\n\r\nThe cases tried were very similar to those at Winchester; batch after\r\nbatch of boys and men in the prime of life were brought up to the dock\r\nfor a brief trial and sentence of exile. Such was the haste that in one\r\ncase at least the prisoners appeared with the handcuffs still on their\r\nwrists, a circumstance which elicited a rebuke from the judge, and\r\nan excuse of overwork from the gaoler. Amongst the first cases eight\r\nprisoners, varying in age from seventeen to thirty, were sentenced to\r\ntransportation for life for doing £500 worth of damage at Brasher’s\r\ncloth mill at Wilton. Thirteen men were transported for seven years and\r\none for fourteen years for breaking threshing machines on the day of\r\nthe Pyt House affray. Mr. John Benett was satisfied with this tale of\r\nvictims in addition to the man killed by the yeomanry, and refrained\r\nfrom prosecuting for the stones thrown at him. For this he took great\r\ncredit in the House of Commons, and no doubt it was open to him to\r\nimitate Bingham Baring’s friends, and to talk of that kind of outrage\r\nas ‘murder.’\r\n\r\nAt Salisbury, as at Winchester, evidence about distress and wages was\r\nruled out by the judges whenever possible; thus when twelve men, nine\r\nof whom were afterwards transported for seven years, were being tried\r\nfor breaking a threshing machine on the farm of a man named Ambrose\r\nPatience, the cross-examination of Patience, which aimed at eliciting\r\nfacts about wages and distress, was stopped by the court on the ground\r\nthat in a case of this sort such evidence was scarcely regular; it was\r\nintimated, however, that the court would hear representations of this\r\nkind later. But some light was thrown incidentally in the course of\r\nthe trials on the circumstances of the prisoners. Thus one of the Pyt\r\nHouse prisoners urged in his defence: ‘My Lord, I found work very bad\r\nin my own parish for the last three years, and having a wife and three\r\nchildren to support I was glad to get work wherever I could get it. I\r\nhad some work at a place four miles from my house.’ He then described\r\nhow on his way to work he was met by the mob and forced to join them.\r\n‘It is a hard case with me, my Lord; I was glad to get work though I\r\ncould earn only seven shillings per week, and it cost me a shilling a\r\nweek for iron, so that I had only six shillings a week to support five\r\npersons.’ Another prisoner, Mould of Hatch, was stated by Lord Arundel\r\nto be very poor: he had a wife and six children, of whom one or two had\r\ndied of typhus since his committal. They had nothing to live on but\r\nwhat they got at Lord Arundel’s house. The benevolent Lord Arundel, or\r\nthe parish, must have supported the survivors indefinitely, for Mould\r\nwas exiled for seven years. Barett again, another of these prisoners,\r\nwas supporting himself, a wife, and a child on 5s. a week. The usual\r\nrate of wages in Wiltshire was 7s. a week.\r\n\r\nEvidence about the instigation of the labourers by those in good\r\ncircumstances was also ruled out, and much that would be interesting\r\nin the history of the riots has thus perished. When six men were being\r\nprosecuted for breaking a threshing machine on the farm of Mr. Judd at\r\nNewton Toney, counsel for the defence started a cross-examination of\r\nthe prosecutor designed to show that certain landowners in the parish\r\nhad instigated the labourers to the outrages, but he was stopped by Mr.\r\nJustice Alderson, who declared that such an inquiry was not material to\r\nthe issue, which was the guilt or innocence of the prisoners. If the\r\nprisoners were found guilty these circumstances would be laid before\r\nthe court in mitigation of punishment. However strong the mitigating\r\ncircumstances in this case were, the punishment was certainly not\r\nmitigated, for all six men were sentenced to the maximum penalty of\r\nseven years’ transportation. In a similar case in Whiteparish it\r\ncame out in the evidence that Squire Bristowe had sent down buckets\r\nof strong beer, and that Squire Wynne, who was staying with Squire\r\nBristowe, was present at the breaking of the machine. In the affair at\r\nAmbrose Patience’s farm already mentioned, the defence of the prisoners\r\nwas that Farmer Parham had offered them half a hogshead of cider if\r\nthey would come and break his machine, whilst in another case three\r\nmen were acquitted because one of the witnesses for the prosecution,\r\na young brother of the farmer whose property had been destroyed,\r\nunexpectedly disclosed the fact that his brother had said to the mob:\r\n‘Act like men, go and break the machine, but don’t go up to the house.’\r\n\r\nThe proportion of charges of extorting money was smaller at Salisbury\r\nthan at Winchester: most of the indictments were for breaking machines\r\nonly. In some instances the prosecution dropped the charge of robbery,\r\nthinking transportation for seven years a sufficient punishment for\r\nthe offence. Three brothers were sentenced to death for taking half a\r\ncrown: nobody received this sentence for a few coppers. In this case\r\nthe three brothers, William, Thomas, and John Legg, aged twenty-eight,\r\ntwenty-one, and eighteen, had gone at midnight to the kitchen door\r\nof the house of Mrs. Montgomery, wife of a J.P., and asked the\r\nmanservant for money or beer. The man gave them half a crown, and they\r\nthanked him civilly and went away. A curious light is thrown on the\r\nrelations between robbers and the robbed in the trial of six men for\r\nmachine-breaking at West Grimstead: the mob of fifty persons asked the\r\nfarmer for a sovereign, he promised to pay it next day, whereupon one\r\nof the mob, a man named Light who was his tenant, offered to pay the\r\nsovereign himself and to deduct it from the rent.\r\n\r\nAt Salisbury, as at Winchester, the fate of the victims depended\r\nlargely on the character given to the prisoners by the local gentry.\r\nThis was especially the case towards the end when justice began to\r\ntire, and a good many charges were dropped. Thus Charles Bourton was\r\nonly imprisoned for three months for breaking a threshing machine,\r\nwhilst John Perry was transported for seven years for the same offence.\r\nBut then John Perry had been convicted seven or eight times for\r\npoaching.\r\n\r\nIn Wiltshire, as in Hampshire, the judges were particularly severe\r\nto those prisoners who were not agricultural labourers. A striking\r\ninstance is worth quoting, not only as illustrating this special\r\nseverity, but also because it shows that the judges when inflicting the\r\nmaximum penalty of seven years’ transportation for machine-breaking\r\nwere well aware that it was tantamount to exile for life. Thomas\r\nPorter, aged eighteen, a shepherd, Henry Dicketts, aged nineteen, a\r\nbricklayer’s labourer, Aaron Shepherd, aged forty (occupation not\r\nstated), James Stevens, aged twenty-five, an agricultural labourer, and\r\nGeorge Burbage, aged twenty-four, also an agricultural labourer, were\r\nfound guilty of machine-breaking at Mr. Blake’s at Idmiston. Stevens\r\nand Burbage escaped with two years’ and one year’s imprisonment with\r\nhard labour, respectively, and the following homily from Mr. Justice\r\nAlderson to think over in prison: ‘You are both thrashers and you might\r\nin the perversion of your understanding think that these machines are\r\ndetrimental to you. Be assured that your labour cannot ultimately be\r\nhurt by the employment of these machines. If they are profitable to\r\nthe farmer, they will also be profitable ultimately to the labourer,\r\nthough they may for a time injure him. If they are not profitable to\r\nthe farmer he will soon cease to employ them.’ The shepherd boy of\r\neighteen, the bricklayer’s labourer of nineteen, and their companion of\r\nforty were reserved for a heavier penalty: ‘As to you, Aaron Shepherd,\r\nI can give you no hope of remaining in this country. You Thomas Porter,\r\nare a shepherd, and you Henry Dicketts, are a bricklayer’s labourer.\r\nYou have nothing to do with threshing machines. They do not interfere\r\nwith your labour, and you could not, even in the darkness of your\r\nignorance, suppose that their destruction would do you any good.... I\r\nhope that your fate will be a warning to others. You will leave the\r\ncountry, all of you: you will see your friends and relations no more:\r\nfor though you will be transported for seven years only, it is not\r\nlikely that at the expiration of that term you will find yourselves in\r\na situation to return. You will be in a distant land at the expiration\r\nof your sentence. The land which you have disgraced will see you no\r\nmore: the friends with whom you are connected will be parted from you\r\nfor ever in this world.’\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Alderson’s methods received a good deal of attention in\r\none of the Salisbury trials, known as the Looker case. Isaac Looker,\r\na well-to-do farmer, was indicted for sending a threatening letter to\r\nJohn Rowland: ‘Mr. Rowland, Haxford Farm, Hif you goes to sware against\r\nor a man in prisson, you have here farm burnt down to ground, and thy\r\nbluddy head chopt off.’ Some evidence was produced to show that Isaac\r\nLooker had asserted in conversation that it was the magistrates and\r\nthe soldiers, and not the mobs, who were the real breakers of the\r\npeace. But this did not amount to absolute proof that he had written\r\nthe letter: to establish this conclusion the prosecution relied on the\r\nevidence of four witnesses; the first had quarrelled with Looker, and\r\nhad not seen his writing for four or five years; the second denied that\r\nthere had been any quarrel, but had not been in the habit of speaking\r\nto the prisoner for five or six years, or seen his writing during that\r\ntime; the third had not had ‘much of a quarrel’ with him, but had not\r\nseen his writing since 1824; the fourth was the special constable who\r\nfound in Looker’s bureau, which was unlocked and stood in the kitchen\r\nwhere the family sat, a blank piece of paper that fitted on to the\r\npiece on which the letter was written. More witnesses were called for\r\nthe defence than for the prosecution, and they included the vestry\r\nclerk of Wimborne, an ex-schoolmaster; all of these witnesses had known\r\nLooker’s writing recently, and all of them swore that the threatening\r\nletter was not in his writing. Mr. Justice Alderson summed up against\r\nthe prisoner, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, and sentence of\r\ntransportation for life was passed upon Looker in spite of his vehement\r\nprotestations of innocence. ‘I cannot attend to these asseverations,’\r\nsaid Mr. Justice Alderson, ‘for we all know that a man who can be\r\nguilty of such an offence as that of which you have been convicted,\r\nwill not hesitate to deny it as you now do. I would rather trust to\r\nsuch evidence as has been given in your case, than to the most solemn\r\ndeclarations even on the scaffold.’\r\n\r\nThe learned judge and the jury then retired for refreshment, when a\r\ncurious development took place. Edward, son of Isaac Looker, aged\r\neighteen years, came forward and declared that he had written the\r\nletter in question and other letters as well. He wrote a copy from\r\nmemory, and the handwriting was precisely similar. He explained that\r\nhe had written the letters without his father’s knowledge and without\r\na thought of the consequences, in order to help two cousins who were\r\nin gaol for machine-breaking. He had heard people say that ‘it would\r\nget my cousins off if threatening letters were written.’ He had let his\r\nfather know in prison that he had written the letters, and had also\r\ntold his father’s solicitor. Edward Looker was subsequently tried and\r\nsentenced to seven years’ transportation: Isaac’s case was submitted to\r\nthe Home Secretary for pardon.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we have said, the Government, or its representatives, grew\r\nrather more lenient towards the end of the proceedings at Salisbury,\r\nit was evidently thought essential to produce some crime deserving\r\nactual death. The culprit in this case was Peter Withers, a young man\r\nof twenty-three, married and with five children. His character till\r\nthe time of the riots was exemplary. He was committed on a charge of\r\nriot, and briefed a lawyer to defend him for this misdemeanour. Just\r\nbefore the trial came on the charge was changed, apparently by the\r\nAttorney-General, to the capital charge of assaulting Oliver Calley\r\nCodrington with a hammer. His counsel was of course unprepared to\r\ndefend him on this charge, and, as he explained afterwards, ‘it was\r\nonly by the humane kindness of the Attorney-General who allowed him\r\nto look at his brief that he was aware of all the facts to be alleged\r\nagainst his client.’ Withers himself seemed equally unprepared; when\r\nasked for his defence he said that he would leave it to his counsel, as\r\nof course he had arranged to do when the charge was one of misdemeanour\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred in an affray at Rockley near Marlborough. Mr.\r\nBaskerville, J.P., rode up with some special constables to a mob of\r\nforty or fifty men, Withers amongst them, and bade them go home. They\r\nrefused, declaring that they did not care a damn for the magistrates.\r\nMr. Baskerville ordered Mr. Codrington, who was a special constable, to\r\narrest Withers. A general mêlée ensued, blows were given and received,\r\nand Codrington was hit by a hammer thrown by Withers. Withers’ own\r\nversion of the affair was that Codrington attacked him without\r\nprovocation in a ferocious manner with a hunting whip, loaded with\r\niron at the end. Baskerville also struck him. He aimed his hammer at\r\nCodrington and it missed. Codrington’s horse then crushed him against\r\nthe wall, and he threw his hammer a second time with better aim. There\r\nwas nothing in the evidence of the prosecution to discredit this\r\nversion, and both Baskerville and Codrington admitted that they might\r\nhave struck him. Codrington’s injuries were apparently more serious\r\nthan Bingham Baring’s; it was stated that he had been confined to bed\r\nfor two or three days, and to the house from Tuesday to Saturday, and\r\nthat he had a scar of one and a half inches on the right side of his\r\nnose. No surgeon, however, appeared as a witness, and the hammer was\r\nnot produced in court. Withers was found guilty and reserved, together\r\nwith Lush, for execution.\r\n\r\nThe special correspondent of the _Times_ who had been present at\r\nWinchester made an interesting comparison between the Hampshire and\r\nthe Wiltshire labourers on trial (8th January 1831). The Wiltshire\r\nlabourers he described as more athletic in appearance and more hardy\r\nin manner. ‘The prisoners here turn to the witnesses against them with\r\na bold and confident air: cross-examine them, and contradict their\r\nanswers, with a confidence and a want of common courtesy, in terms of\r\nwhich comparatively few instances occurred in the neighbouring county.’\r\nIn this behaviour the correspondent detected the signs of a very low\r\nstate of moral intelligence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the last scene in court there was no trace of\r\nthe bold demeanour which had impressed the _Times_ correspondent during\r\nthe conduct of the trials. For the people of Wiltshire, like the people\r\nof Hampshire, were stunned by the crash and ruin of this catastrophic\r\nvengeance. The two men sentenced to death were reprieved, but one\r\nhundred and fifty-four men and boys were sentenced to transportation,\r\nthirty-three of them for life, the rest for seven or fourteen years,\r\nwith no prospect of ever returning to their homes. And Alderson and\r\nhis brother judges in so punishing this wild fling of folly, or\r\nhope, or despair, were not passing sentence only on the men and boys\r\nbefore them: they were pronouncing a doom not less terrible on wives\r\nand mothers and children and babes in arms in every village on the\r\nWiltshire Downs. One man begged to be allowed to take his child,\r\neight months old, into exile, for its mother had died in childbirth,\r\nand it would be left without kith or kin. He was told by the judge\r\nthat he should have remembered this earlier. The sentence of final\r\nseparation on all these families and homes was received with a frenzy\r\nof consternation and grief, and the judges themselves were affected\r\nby the spectacle of these broken creatures in the dock and round the\r\ncourt, abandoned to the unchecked paroxysms of despair.[479] ‘Such a\r\ntotal prostration of the mental faculties by fear,’ wrote the _Times_\r\ncorrespondent, ‘and such a terrible exhibition of anguish and despair,\r\nI never before witnessed in a Court of Justice.’ ‘Immediately on the\r\nconclusion of this sentence a number of women, who were seated in court\r\nbehind the prisoners, set up a dreadful shriek of lamentation. Some of\r\nthem rushed forward to shake hands with the prisoners, and more than\r\none voice was heard to exclaim, “Farewell, I shall never see you more.”’\r\n\r\n‘The whole proceedings of this day in court were of the most afflicting\r\nand distressing nature. But the laceration of the feelings did not end\r\nwith the proceedings in court. The car for the removal of the prisoners\r\nwas at the back entrance to the court-house and was surrounded by\r\na crowd of mothers, wives, sisters and children, anxiously waiting\r\nfor a glance of their condemned relatives. The weeping and wailing\r\nof the different parties, as they pressed the hands of the convicts\r\nas they stepped into the car, was truly heartrending. We never saw\r\nso distressing a spectacle before, and trust that the restored\r\ntranquillity of the country will prevent us from ever seeing anything\r\nlike it again.’\r\n\r\nThe historian may regret that these men do not pass out before him in\r\na cold and splendid defiance. Their blind blow had been struck and it\r\nhad been answered; they had dreamt that their lot might be made less\r\nintolerable, and the governing class had crushed that daring fancy for\r\never with banishment and the breaking of their homes; it only remained\r\nfor them to accept their fate with a look of stone upon their faces\r\nand a curse of fire in their hearts. So had Muir and Palmer and many\r\na political prisoner, victims of the tyrannies of Pitt and Dundas,\r\nof Castlereagh and Sidmouth, gone to their barbarous doom. So had\r\nthe Lantenacs and the Gauvains alike gone to the guillotine. History\r\nlikes to match such calm and unshaken bearing against the distempered\r\njustice of power. Here she is cheated of her spectacle. Outwardly it\r\nmight seem a worse fate for men of education to be flung to the hulks\r\nwith the coarsest of felons: for men whose lives had been comfortable\r\nto be thrust into the dirt and disorder of prisons. But political\r\nprisoners are martyrs, and martyrs are not the stuff for pity. However\r\nbitter their sufferings, they do not suffer alone: they are sustained\r\nby a Herculean comradeship of hopes and of ideas. The darkest cage is\r\nlighted by a ray from Paradise to men or women who believe that the\r\nnight of their sufferings will bring a dawn less cold and sombre to\r\nmankind than the cold and sombre dawn of yesterday. But what ideas\r\nbefriended the ploughboy or the shepherd torn from his rude home? What\r\nvision had he of a nobler future for humanity? To what dawn did he\r\nleave his wife or his mother, his child, his home, his friends, or his\r\ntrampled race? What robe of dream and hope and fancy was thrown over\r\nhis exile or their hunger, his poignant hour of separation, or their\r\nceaseless ache of poverty and cold\r\n\r\n      ‘to comfort the human want\r\n    From the bosom of magical skies’?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe three judges who had restored respect for law and order in\r\nWiltshire and Hampshire next proceeded to Dorchester, where a Special\r\nCommission to try the Dorsetshire rioters was opened on 11th January.\r\nThe rising had been less serious in Dorset than in the two other\r\ncounties, and there were only some fifty prisoners awaiting trial on\r\ncharges of machine-breaking, extorting money and riot. The Government\r\ntook no part in the prosecutions; for, as it was explained in a letter\r\nto Denman, ‘the state of things is quite altered; great effect has\r\nbeen produced: the law has been clearly explained, and prosecutions\r\ngo on without the least difficulty.’[480] Baron Vaughan and Mr.\r\nJustice Parke had given the charges at Winchester and Salisbury: it\r\nwas now the turn of Mr. Justice Alderson, and in his opening survey\r\nof the social conditions of the time he covered a wide field. To the\r\nusual dissertation on the economics of machinery he added a special\r\nhomily on the duties incumbent on the gentry, who were bidden to\r\ndiscourage and discountenance, and if necessary to prosecute, the\r\ndangerous publications that were doing such harm in rural districts.\r\nBut their duties did not end here, and they were urged to go home and\r\nto educate their poorer neighbours and to improve their conditions.\r\nThe improvement to be aimed at, however, was not material but moral.\r\n‘Poverty,’ said Mr. Justice Alderson, ‘is indeed, I fear, inseparable\r\nfrom the state of the human race, but poverty itself and the misery\r\nattendant on it, would no doubt be greatly mitigated if a spirit of\r\nprudence were more generally diffused among the people, and if they\r\nunderstood more fully and practised better their civil, moral and\r\nreligious duties.’\r\n\r\nThe Dorsetshire labourers had unfortunately arrived at the precipitate\r\nconclusion that a spirit of prudence would not transform 7s. a week\r\ninto a reasonable livelihood. They used no violence beyond breaking up\r\nthe threshing machines. ‘We don’t intend to hurt the farmer,’ they told\r\nthe owner of one machine, ‘but we are determined that the land shall\r\ncome down, and the tithes, and we will have more wages.’ When money\r\nwas taken it seems to have been demanded and received in an amicable\r\nspirit. The sums asked for were often very small. Sentence of death was\r\npronounced on two men, Joseph Sheppard and George Legg, for taking 2s.\r\nfrom Farmer Christopher Morey at Buckland Newton. The mob asked for\r\nmoney, and the farmer offered them 1s.: they replied that they wanted\r\n1s. 6d., and the farmer gave them 2s. Sheppard’s character was very\r\ngood, and it came out that he and the prosecutor had had a dispute\r\nabout money some years before. He was transported, but not for life.\r\nLegg was declared by the prosecutor to have been ‘saucy and impudent,’\r\nand to have ‘talked rough and bobbish.’ His character, however, was\r\nstated by many witnesses, including the clergyman, to be exemplary.\r\nHe had five children whom he supported without parish help on 7s. a\r\nweek: a cottage was given him but no fuel. Baron Vaughan was so much\r\nimpressed by this evidence that he declared that he had never heard\r\nbetter testimony to character, and that he would recommend a less\r\nsevere penalty than transportation. But Legg showed a lamentable want\r\nof discretion, for he interrupted the judge with these words: ‘I would\r\nrather that your Lordship would put twenty-one years’ transportation\r\nupon me than be placed in the condition of the prosecutor. I never said\r\na word to him, that I declare.’ Baron Vaughan sardonically remarked\r\nthat he had not benefited himself by this observation.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to give less severe punishment, noticed in the closing\r\ntrials at Salisbury, was more marked at Dorchester. Nine men were\r\nlet off on recognisances and ten were not proceeded against: in the\r\ncase of six of these ten the prosecutor, one Robert Bullen, who had\r\nbeen robbed of 4s. and 2s. 6d., refused to come forward. But enough\r\nsharp sentences were given to keep the labourers in submission for the\r\nfuture. One man was transported for life and eleven for seven years:\r\nfifteen were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment; seven were\r\nacquitted. It was not surprising that the special correspondent of the\r\n_Times_ complained that such meagre results scarcely justified the\r\npomp and expense of a Special Commission. In the neighbouring county\r\nof Gloucester, where the country gentlemen carried out the work of\r\nretribution without help from headquarters, seven men were transported\r\nfor fourteen years, twenty for seven years, and twenty-five were\r\nsentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from six months to three\r\nyears. All of these sentences were for breaking threshing machines.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances in Berks and Bucks had been considered serious enough\r\nto demand a Special Commission, and Sir James Alan Park, Sir William\r\nBolland and Sir John Patteson were the judges appointed. The first of\r\nthe two Berkshire Commissions opened at Reading on 27th December. The\r\nEarl of Abingdon, Lord-Lieutenant of the County, and Mr. Charles Dundas\r\nwere the two local commissioners. Mr. Dundas has figured already in\r\nthese pages as chairman of the meeting at Speenhamland. One hundred and\r\nthirty-eight prisoners were awaiting trial at Reading: they were most\r\nof them young, only eighteen being forty or over. The rest, with few\r\nexceptions, varied from seventeen to thirty-five in age, and must have\r\nlived all their lives under the Speenhamland system.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to compare the accounts of the Special Commissions in\r\nBerks and Bucks with those in Hampshire and Wiltshire without noticing\r\na difference in the treatment of the rioters. The risings had been\r\nalmost simultaneous, the offences were of the same character, and the\r\nCommissions sat at the same time. The difference was apparent from\r\nthe first, and on 1st January the _Times_ published a leading article\r\npleading for uniformity, and pointing out that the Berkshire Commission\r\nwas ‘a merciful contrast’ to that at Winchester. The cause is probably\r\nto be found in the dispositions and characters of the authorities\r\nresponsible in the two cases. The country gentlemen of Berkshire,\r\nrepresented by a man like Mr. Dundas, were more humane than the country\r\ngentlemen of Hampshire, represented by men like the Duke of Wellington\r\nand the Barings; Mr. Gurney, the public prosecutor at Reading, was more\r\nlenient than Sir Thomas Denman, and the Reading judges were more kindly\r\nand considerate than the judges at Winchester. Further, there had been\r\nin Berkshire little of the wild panic that swept over the country\r\nhouses in Hampshire and Wiltshire. The judges at Reading occasionally\r\ninterjected questions on the prisoners’ behalf, and in many cases they\r\ndid not conceal their satisfaction at an acquittal. Further, they had\r\na more delicate sense for the proprieties. Contrary to custom, they\r\nasked neither the Grand Jury nor the magistrates to dinner on the first\r\nday, being anxious, we are told, to free the administration of justice\r\n‘from the slightest appearance of partiality in the eyes of the lower\r\nclasses.’ The Lord Chancellor and Lord Melbourne had been consulted and\r\nhad approved.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Mr. Justice Park’s theories of life and\r\nsocial relationships differed from those of his brothers at Winchester.\r\nIn his address to the Grand Jury he repudiated with indignation\r\nthe ‘impudent and base slander ... that the upper ranks of society\r\ncare little for the wants and privations of the poor. I deny this\r\npositively, upon a very extensive means of knowledge upon subjects of\r\nthis nature. But every man can deny it who looks about him and sees\r\nthe vast institutions in every part of the kingdom for the relief of\r\nthe young and the old, the deaf and the lame, the blind, the widow,\r\nthe orphan----and every child of wretchedness and woe. There is not a\r\ncalamity or distress incident to humanity, either of body or of mind,\r\nthat is not humbly endeavoured to be mitigated or relieved, by the\r\npowerful and the affluent, either of high or middling rank, in this\r\nour happy land, which for its benevolence, charity, and boundless\r\nhumanity, has been the admiration of the world.’ The theory that the\r\nrich kept the poor in a state of starvation and that this was the cause\r\nof the disturbances, he declared later to be entirely disproved by the\r\nconduct of one of the mobs in destroying a threshing machine belonging\r\nto William Mount, Esq., at Wasing, ‘Mr. Mount having given away £100\r\nno longer ago than last winter to assist the lower orders during that\r\ninclement season.’\r\n\r\nA feature of the Reading Commission was the difficulty of finding\r\njurymen. All farmers were challenged on behalf of the prisoners, and\r\nmatters were at a deadlock until the judges ordered the bystanders to\r\nbe impannelled.\r\n\r\nThe earlier cases were connected with the riots in Hungerford. Property\r\nin an iron foundry had been destroyed, and fifteen men were found\r\nguilty on this capital charge. One of the fifteen was William Oakley,\r\nwho now paid the penalty for his £5 and strong language. But when the\r\nfirst cases were over, Mr. Gurney began to drop the capital charge, and\r\nto content himself, as a rule, with convictions for breaking threshing\r\nmachines. One case revealed serious perjury on one side or the other.\r\nThomas Goodfellow and Cornelius Bennett were charged with breaking a\r\nthreshing machine at Matthew Batten’s farm. The prisoners produced four\r\nwitnesses, two labourers, a woman whose husband was in prison for the\r\nriots, and John Gaiter, who described himself as ‘not quite a master\r\nbricklayer,’ to prove that Matthew Batten had encouraged the riots. The\r\nfirst three witnesses declared that Batten had asked the rioters to\r\ncome and break his machine in order to serve out his landlord and Mr.\r\nWard, and had promised them victuals and £1. Batten and his son, on the\r\nother hand, swore that these statements were false. The prisoners were\r\nfound guilty, with a recommendation to mercy which was disregarded.\r\nGoodfellow, who was found guilty of breaking other machines as well,\r\nwas sentenced to fourteen, and Cornelius Bennett to seven years’\r\ntransportation. The judge spoke of their scandalous attempt to blacken\r\nthe character of a respectable farmer: ‘it pleased God however that the\r\natrocious attempt had failed.’ It would be interesting to know what\r\nwere the relations between Matthew Batten and his landlord.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the trials Mr. Gurney announced that there would be\r\nno more prosecutions for felony, as enough had been done in the way of\r\nmaking examples. Some interesting cases of riot were tried. The most\r\nimportant riot had taken place as early as 19th November, and the hero\r\nof the proceedings was the Rev. Edward Cove, the venerable Vicar of\r\nBrimpton, one of the many parson magistrates. A mob had assembled in\r\norder to demand an increase of wages, and it was met by Mr. Cove and\r\nhis posse of special constables. On occasions like this, Mr. Gurney\r\nremarked, we become sensible of the great advantages of our social\r\norder. Mr. Cove without more ado read the Riot Act; the mob refused\r\nto disperse; his special constables thereupon attacked them, and a\r\ngeneral mêlée followed in which hard blows were given and taken. No\r\none attempted to strike Mr. Cove himself, but one of his companions\r\nreceived from a rioter, whom he identified, a blow rivalling that given\r\nto Mr. Bingham Baring, which beat the crown of his hat in and drove the\r\nrim over his eyes: it was followed by other and more serious blows on\r\nhis head and body. The counsel for the defence tried to show that it\r\nwas distress that had caused the rioters to assemble, and he quoted a\r\nremark of the Chairman of Quarter Sessions that the poor were starved\r\nalmost into insurrection; but all evidence about wages was ruled out.\r\nThe court were deeply impressed by this riot, and Mr. Justice Park\r\nannounced that it had alarmed him and his fellow judges more ‘than\r\nanything that had hitherto transpired in these proceedings.’ ‘Had one\r\nlife been lost,’ he continued, ‘the lives of every individual of the\r\nmob would have been forfeited, and the law must have been carried into\r\neffect against those convicted.’ As it was, nobody was condemned to\r\ndeath for his share in the affray, though the more violent, such as\r\nGeorge Williams, alias ‘Staffordshire Jack,’ a ‘desperate character,’\r\nreceived heavier penalties for machine-breaking in consequence.\r\n\r\nThree men were reserved for execution: William Oakley, who was told\r\nthat as a carpenter he had no business to mix himself up in these\r\ntransactions; Alfred Darling, a blacksmith by trade, who had been found\r\nguilty on several charges of demanding money; and Winterbourne, who had\r\ntaken part in the Hungerford affair in the magistrates’ room, and had\r\nalso acted as leader in some cases when a mob asked for money. In one\r\ninstance the mob had been content with £1 instead of the £2 for which\r\nit had asked for breaking a threshing machine, Winterbourne remarking,\r\n‘we will take half price because he has stood like a man.’\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in Berkshire was horrified at the prospect of taking\r\nlife. Petitions for mercy poured in from Reading, including one from\r\nladies to the queen, from Newbury, from Hungerford, from Henley, and\r\nfrom other places. Two country gentlemen, Mr. J. B. Monck and Mr.\r\nWheble, made every exertion to save the condemned men. They waited with\r\npetitions on Lord Melbourne, who heard them patiently for an hour. They\r\nobtained a reprieve for Oakley and for Darling, who were transported\r\nfor life; Winterbourne they could not save: he was hung on 11th\r\nJanuary, praying to the last that his wife, who was dangerously ill of\r\ntyphus, might die before she knew of his fate.\r\n\r\nFifty-six men were sentenced to transportation from\r\nReading--twenty-three for life, sixteen for fourteen years, seventeen\r\nfor seven years: thirty-six were sent to prison for various terms.\r\n\r\nThe same commissioners went on to Abingdon where proceedings opened on\r\n6th January. Here there were only forty-seven prisoners, all but two of\r\nwhom were agricultural labourers, most of them very young. The cases\r\nresembled those tried at Reading, but it is clear that the evidence\r\nof Mrs. Charlotte Slade, whose conduct we have already described, and\r\nher method of dealing with the rioters, made a great impression on Mr.\r\nJustice Park and his colleagues, and opened their eyes to the true\r\nperspective of the rhetorical language that had assumed such terrifying\r\nimportance to other judges. One young labourer, Richard Kempster by\r\nname, who was found guilty of breaking a threshing machine, had carried\r\na black-and-red flag in the mob, and when arrested had exclaimed, ‘be\r\ndamned if I don’t wish it was a revolution, and that all was a fire\r\ntogether’: it is easy to imagine the grave homily on the necessity of\r\ncutting such a man off for ever from his kind that these words would\r\nhave provoked from the judges at Winchester. Mr. Justice Park and\r\nhis colleagues sentenced Kempster to twelve months’ imprisonment. At\r\nAbingdon only one man was sentenced to be transported; Thomas Mackrell,\r\nan agricultural labourer of forty-three. Another, Henry Woolridge,\r\nhad sentence of death commuted to eighteen months’ imprisonment.\r\nThirty-five others were sent to prison for various terms.\r\n\r\nThe same three judges proceeded to Aylesbury to try the Buckinghamshire\r\nrioters. The chief event in this county had been the destruction of\r\npaper-making machinery at Wycombe. The Commission opened on 11th\r\nJanuary: the Duke of Buckingham and Mr. Maurice Swabey were the local\r\ncommissioners. There were one hundred and thirty-six prisoners to\r\nbe tried, almost all young and illiterate: only eighteen were forty\r\nyears of age or over. Forty-four men and boys were found guilty of\r\nthe capital charge of destroying paper machinery. Most of the other\r\nprisoners who were charged with breaking threshing machines were\r\nallowed to plead guilty and let off on their own recognisances, or\r\nelse the charge was not pressed. An exception was made in a case in\r\nwhich some members of a mob had been armed with guns. Three men who had\r\ncarried guns were sent to transportation for seven years, and thirteen\r\nothers involved were sent to prison for two years or eighteen months.\r\nSeveral men were tried for rioting, and those who had combined a demand\r\nfor increased wages with a request for the restoration of parish\r\nbuns were sent to prison for six weeks.[481] One more trial is worth\r\nnotice, because it suggests that even in Buckinghamshire, where the\r\ngeneral temper was more lenient, individuals who had made themselves\r\nobnoxious were singled out for special treatment. John Crook, a miller,\r\nwas indicted with four others for riotously assembling and breaking a\r\nwinnowing machine at Mr. Fryer’s at Long Crendon. As Crook was charged\r\nwith a misdemeanour his counsel could address the jury, and we learn\r\nfrom his speech that Crook had been kept in prison since 2nd December,\r\nthough £2000 had been offered in bail and many other prisoners had\r\nbeen allowed out. The explanation, it was argued, was to be found in\r\nthe fact that Crook had come into some property which qualified him to\r\nhold a gun licence and to kill game. He was sentenced to three months’\r\nimprisonment without hard labour, and to pay a fine of £10.\r\n\r\nThirty-two men in all were sent to prison for the agricultural\r\ndisturbances in addition to the three sentenced to transportation.\r\nForty-two of those concerned in the breaking of paper-making machinery\r\nreceived sentence of death, but their punishment was commuted to life\r\ntransportation for one, seven years’ transportation for twenty-two, and\r\nimprisonment for various terms for the rest. Two men were reserved for\r\nexecution. One, Thomas Blizzard, was thirty years old, with a wife and\r\nthree children. His character was excellent. At the time of the riots\r\nhe was a roundsman, receiving 1s. a day from the overseer’s and 1s.\r\n6d. a week from a farmer. He told his employer at Little Marlow that\r\nhe would take a holiday to go machine-breaking, for he would endure\r\nimprisonment, or even transportation, rather than see his wife and\r\nchildren cry for bread. John Sarney, the other, was fifty-six years\r\nold and had a wife and six children: he kept a small beer-shop and his\r\ncharacter was irreproachable. Petitions on behalf of the two men were\r\nsigned extensively, and the sentence was commuted to transportation for\r\nlife. The Aylesbury sentences seem lenient in comparison with those\r\ngiven at Salisbury and Winchester, but they did not seem lenient to\r\nthe people in the district. ‘Pen cannot describe,’ wrote a _Times_\r\ncorrespondent, ‘the heart-rending scene of despair, misery and want,\r\nprevailing at Flackwell-Heath, the residence of the families of the\r\nmajor part of the misguided men now incarcerated at Aylesbury.’ The\r\nsame correspondent tells of a benevolent Quaker, who had become rich as\r\na maker of paper, helping these families by stealth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe work of the Special Commissions was now over. Melbourne had\r\nexplained in Parliament that they had been set up ‘to expound the law’\r\nand to bring home to the ignorant the gravity of their crimes against\r\nsocial order. In spite of the daily imposition of ferocious punishments\r\non poachers and thieves, the poor apparently did not know in what\r\nletters of blood the code against rioting and discontent was composed.\r\nThese three weeks had brought a lurid enlightenment into their dark\r\nhomes. In the riots, as we have seen, the only man who had been\r\nkilled was a rioter, killed according to the reports of the time by a\r\nyeomanry soldier, according to local tradition by a farmer, and for\r\nthat offence he had been refused Christian burial. On the other side,\r\nnot a single person had been killed or seriously wounded. For these\r\nriots, apart from the cases of arson, for which six men or boys were\r\nhung, aristocratic justice exacted three lives, and the transportation\r\nof four hundred and fifty-seven men and boys,[482] in addition to\r\nthe imprisonment of about four hundred at home. The shadow of this\r\nvengeance still darkens the minds of old men and women in the villages\r\nof Wiltshire, and eighty years have been too short a time to blot out\r\nits train of desolating memories.[483] Nobody who does not realise what\r\nMr. Hudson has described with his intimate touch, the effect on the\r\nimagination and the character of ‘a life of simple unchanging action\r\nand of habits that are like instincts, of hard labour in sun and rain\r\nand wind from day to day,’ can ever understand what the breaking of all\r\nthe ties of life and home and memory meant to the exiles and to those\r\nfrom whose companionship they were then torn for ever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have said that one feature of the rising was the firing of stacks\r\nand ricks and barns. This practice was widespread, and fires broke\r\nout even in counties where the organised rising made little progress.\r\nAssociations for the detection of incendiaries were formed at an\r\nearly stage, and immense rewards were offered. Yet not a single case\r\nof arson was tried before the Special Commissions, and the labourers\r\nkept their secret well. Many of the governing class in the early days\r\npersuaded themselves that the labourers had no secret to keep, and\r\nthat the fires were due to any one except the labourers, and to any\r\ncause except distress. Perhaps the wish was father to the thought,\r\nfor as the _Times_ observed, persons responsible for grinding the\r\nfaces of their labourers preferred to think the outrages the work of\r\nstrangers. Sometimes it was smugglers, suffering from the depression in\r\ntheir trade: sometimes it was foreigners: sometimes it was mysterious\r\ngentlemen in gigs, driving furiously about the country, led by Captain\r\nSwing, scattering fireballs and devastation. These were the fashionable\r\ntheories in the House of Lords, although Richmond reminded his brother\r\npeers that there had been a flood of petitions representing the\r\nsufferings of the labourers from the very beginning of the year, and\r\nthat the House of Lords had not thought it necessary to give them the\r\nslightest attention. Lord Camden ascribed the outrages to the French\r\nspirit, and argued that the country was enjoying ‘what was undeniably\r\na genial autumn.’ The Duke of Wellington took the same view, denying\r\nthat the troubles were due to distress: the most influential cause of\r\ndisturbances was the example, ‘and I will unhesitatingly say the bad\r\nand the mischievous example, afforded by the neighbouring States.’\r\nEldon remarked that many of the prisoners taken in the riots were\r\nforeigners, a point on which Melbourne undeceived him. The speakers who\r\nregarded the disturbances in the south of England as the overflow of\r\nthe Paris Revolution had no positive evidence to produce, but they had\r\na piece of negative evidence which they thought conclusive. For if the\r\nlabourers knew who were the incendiaries, they would surely have given\r\ninformation. In some cases a reward of £1000 with a free pardon for\r\nall except the actual author was waiting to be claimed, ‘and yet not\r\none of the miserable beings have availed themselves of the prospect of\r\nbecoming rich.’\r\n\r\nSome eleven cases of arson were tried at the Assizes in Essex, Kent,\r\nSussex, and Surrey: all the prisoners were agricultural labourers and\r\nmost of them were boys. Eight were convicted, often on very defective\r\nevidence, and six were executed. One of the eight, Thomas Goodman, a\r\nboy of eighteen, saved his life by declaring in prison that the idea\r\nhad been put into his head by a lecture of Cobbett’s. Two brothers of\r\nthe name of Pakeman, nineteen and twenty years old, were convicted on\r\nthe evidence of Bishop, another lad of eighteen, who had prompted\r\nthem to set fire to a barn, and later turned king’s evidence ‘after\r\na gentleman in the gaol had told him of the big reward.’ This fire\r\nseems to have been a piece of bravado, as no doubt many others were,\r\nfor Bishop remarked, as the three were sitting under a hedge after\r\nlighting the barn, ‘who says we can’t have a fire too, as well as\r\nthem at Blean?’ The two boys, who had never been taught to read or\r\nwrite, scandalised the public by displaying a painful indifference\r\nto the ministrations of the chaplain, and dying without receiving\r\nthe sacrament.[484] A half-witted boy of fourteen, Richard Pennells,\r\nwas tried at Lewes for setting fire to his master’s haystack for a\r\npromise of sixpence from a man who was not discovered. His master, who\r\nprosecuted, remarked that he was ‘dull of apprehension, but not so much\r\nas not to know right from wrong.’ The boy, who had no counsel, offered\r\nno defence, and stood sobbing in the dock. The jury found him guilty,\r\nwith a recommendation to mercy on account of his youth and imperfect\r\nunderstanding. Sentence of death was recorded, but he was told that his\r\nlife would be spared.\r\n\r\nThese same Lewes Assizes, conducted by Mr. Justice Taunton, afforded\r\na striking example of the comparative treatment of different crimes.\r\nThomas Brown, a lad of seventeen, was charged with writing the\r\nfollowing letter to Lord Sheffield, ‘Please, my Lord, I dont wise to\r\nhurt you. This is the case al the world over. If you dont get rid of\r\nyour foreign steward and farmer and bailiff in a few days time--less\r\nthan a month--we will burn him up, and you along with him. My writing\r\nis bad, but my firing is good my Lord.’ Lord Sheffield gave evidence\r\nas to the receipt of the letter: the prisoner, who had no counsel, was\r\nasked by the judge if he would like to put any questions, and he only\r\nreplied that he hoped that his lordship would forgive him. The judge\r\nanswered that his lordship had not the power, and sentenced Brown to\r\ntransportation for life.[485] Later on in the same Assizes, Captain\r\nWinter, a man of sixty, captain of a coasting vessel, was tried for\r\nthe murder of his wife, who had been killed in a most brutal manner.\r\nHe had been hacking and wounding her for four hours at night, and she\r\nwas last seen alive at half past two in the morning, naked and begging\r\nfor mercy. Her body was covered with wounds. The man’s defence was\r\nthat he came home drunk, that he found his wife drunk, and that he had\r\nno knowledge of what followed. To the general surprise Captain Winter\r\nescaped with a verdict of manslaughter. ‘The prisoner,’ wrote the\r\n_Times_ correspondent, ‘is indebted for his life to the very merciful\r\nway in which Mr. Justice Taunton appeared to view the case, and the\r\nhint which he threw out to the jury, that the parties might have had\r\na quarrel, in which case her death by the prisoner would amount to\r\nmanslaughter only.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the disturbances began, the Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister,\r\nand Sir Robert Peel Home Secretary. But in November 1830 Wellington,\r\nwho had made a last effort to rally the old Tories, sulking over his\r\nsurrender on Catholic Emancipation, by some sudden thunder against\r\nReform, had been beaten on the Civil List and resigned. Reform was\r\ninevitable, and with Reform the Whigs. Thus, towards the close of the\r\nyear of the Revolution that drove Charles X. from France, Lord Grey\r\nbecame Prime Minister, to carry the measure which as Charles Grey,\r\nlieutenant of Charles Fox, he had proposed in the House of Commons in\r\n1793, a few months after Louis XVI. had lost his head in the Revolution\r\nwhich had maddened and terrified the English aristocracy. Fortune\r\nhad been sparing in her favours to this cold, proud, honourable and\r\ncourageous man. She had shut him out from power for twenty-three years,\r\nwaiting to make him Prime Minister until he was verging on seventy, and\r\nall the dash and ardour of youth had been chilled by disappointment\r\nand delay. But she had reserved her extreme of malice to the end, for\r\nit was her chief unkindness that having waited so long she did not\r\nwait a little longer. Grey, who had been forty-four years in public\r\nlife, and forty-three in opposition, took office at the moment that\r\nthe rising passed into Hampshire and Wiltshire, and thus his first act\r\nas Prime Minister was to summon his colleagues to a Cabinet meeting to\r\ndiscuss, not their plans for Parliamentary Reform, but the measures to\r\nbe taken in this alarming emergency. After a lifetime of noble protest\r\nagainst war, intolerance, and repression, he found himself in the toils\r\nand snares of the consequences of a policy in which war, intolerance,\r\nand repression had been constant and conspicuous features. And those\r\nconsequences were especially to be dreaded by such a man at such a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nGrey became Prime Minister to carry Reform, and Reform was still\r\nenveloped to many minds in the wild fancies and terrors of a Jacobin\r\npast. To those who knew, conscious as they were of their own modest\r\npurposes and limited aim, that their accession to power boded to many\r\nviolence, confusion, and the breaking up of the old ways and life of\r\nthe State, it was maddening that these undiscerning peasants should\r\nchoose this moment of all others for noise and riot. The struggle for\r\nReform was certain to lead to strife, and it was hard that before\r\nthey entered upon it England should already be in tumult from other\r\ncauses. Moreover, Grey had to reckon with William IV. So long as he\r\ncould remember, the Court had been the refuge of all that was base\r\nin English politics, and it was a question whether Liberal ideas had\r\nsuffered more from the narrow and darkened mind of George III. or the\r\nmean and incorrigible perfidy of George IV. In comparison with his\r\nfather, the new king had the wisdom of a Bentham or an Adam Smith; in\r\ncomparison with his brother, he had the generous and loyal heart of a\r\nPhilip Sidney or a Falkland. But seen in any less flattering mirror, he\r\nwas a very ordinary mortal, and Grey had known this jolly, drinking,\r\nsailor prince too long and too well to trust either his intellect or\r\nhis character, under too fierce or too continuous a strain. These\r\nriots tried him severely. No sooner was William on his throne than\r\nthe labourers came out of their dens, looking like those sansculottes\r\nwhose shadows were never far from the imagination of the English upper\r\nclasses. The king’s support of Reform was no violent enthusiasm, and\r\nthe slightest threat of disorder might disturb the uneasy equilibrium\r\nof his likes and fears. In the long run it depended on the will of this\r\ngenial mediocrity--so strangely had Providence mixed caprice and design\r\nin this world of politics--whether or not Reform should be carried,\r\nand carried without bloodshed. Throughout these months then, the king,\r\nalways at Melbourne’s elbow, trying to tempt and push the Government\r\ninto more drastic measures, was a very formidable enemy to the cause of\r\nmoderation and of justice.\r\n\r\nThese influences were strong, and there was little to counteract them.\r\nFor there was nobody in the world which Grey and Melbourne alike\r\ninhabited who could enter into the minds of the labourers. This is\r\nreadily seen, if we glance at two men who were regarded as extreme\r\nRadicals in the House of Commons, Hobhouse and Burdett. Each of these\r\nmen had served the cause of Reform in prison as well as in Parliament,\r\nand each with rather ridiculous associations; Hobhouse’s imprisonment\r\nbeing connected with the ballad inspired by the malicious and disloyal\r\nwit of his friend and hero, Byron, and Burdett’s with the ludicrous\r\nscene of his arrest, with his boy spelling out Magna Charta on his\r\nknee. It is difficult for those who have read Hobhouse’s _Diaries_\r\nto divine what play of reason and feeling ever made him a Radical,\r\nbut a Radical he was, an indefatigable critic of the old régime, and\r\nin particular of such abuses as flogging in the army. Burdett was a\r\nleader in the same causes. To these men, if to any, the conduct of\r\nthe labourers might have seemed to call for sympathy rather than for\r\nviolence. But if we turn to Hobhouse’s _Diary_ we see that he was\r\nnever betrayed into a solitary expression of pity or concern for the\r\nscenes we have described, and as for Burdett, he was all for dragooning\r\nthe discontented counties and placing them under martial law. And\r\neven Radnor, who as a friend of Cobbett was much less academic in his\r\nRadicalism, sat on the Wiltshire Commission without making any protest\r\nthat has reached posterity.\r\n\r\nAll the circumstances then made it easy for Grey and his colleagues\r\nto slip into a policy of violence and repression. They breathed an\r\natmosphere of panic, and they dreaded the recoil of that panic on their\r\nown schemes. Yet when all allowance is made for this insidious climate,\r\nwhen we remember that no man is so dangerous as the kind man haunted\r\nby the fear of seeming weak, at a moment when he thinks his power of\r\ndoing good depends on his character for strength; when we remember,\r\ntoo, the tone of Society caught between scare and excitement, the\r\nbad inspiration of the Court, the malevolent influence of an alarmed\r\nOpposition, the absorbing interest of making a ministry, the game apart\r\nfrom the business of politics, it is still difficult to understand how\r\nmen like Grey and Holland and Durham could ever have lent themselves to\r\nthe cruelties of this savage retribution. When first there were rumours\r\nof the intention of the Government to put down the riots with severe\r\nmeasures, Cobbett wrote a passage in which he reviewed the characters\r\nof the chief ministers, Grey with his ‘humane disposition,’ Holland\r\n‘who never gave his consent to an act of cruelty,’ Althorp ‘who has\r\nnever dipped his hand in blood,’ Brougham ‘who with all his half Scotch\r\ncrotchets has at any rate no blood about him,’ to show that the new\r\nministers, unlike many of their Tory predecessors, might be trusted to\r\nbe lenient and merciful. Two of these men, Grey and Holland, had made a\r\nnoble stand against all the persecutions of which Tory Governments had\r\nbeen guilty, defending with passion men whose opinions they regarded\r\nwith horror; if any record could justify confidence it was theirs.\r\nUnfortunately the politician who was made Home Secretary did not share\r\nin this past. The common talk at the time of Melbourne’s appointment\r\nwas that he was too lazy for his office; the real criticism should have\r\nbeen that he had taken the side of Castlereagh and Sidmouth in 1817.\r\nAs Home Secretary he stopped short of the infamous measures he had\r\nthen approved; he refused to employ spies, and the Habeas Corpus was\r\nnot suspended. But nobody can follow the history of this rising, and\r\nthe history of the class that made it, without recognising that the\r\npunishment which exiled these four hundred and fifty labourers is a\r\nstain, and an indelible stain, on the reputation of the Government that\r\nlives in history on the fame of the Reform Bill. It is difficult to\r\nbelieve that either Fox or Sheridan could have been parties to it. The\r\nchief shame attaches to Melbourne, who let the judges do their worst,\r\nand to Lansdowne, who sat beside the judges on the Salisbury bench, but\r\nthe fact that the Prime Minister was immersed in the preparation of a\r\nreform, believed by his contemporaries to be a revolution, does not\r\nrelieve him of his share of the odium, which is the due of Governments\r\nthat are cruel to the weak, and careless of justice to the poor.\r\n\r\nOne effort was made, apart from the intercession of public opinion,\r\nto induce the Government to relax its rigours. When the panic had\r\nabated and the last echo of the riots had been stilled by this summary\r\nretribution, a motion was proposed in the House of Commons for a\r\ngeneral amnesty. Unhappily the cause of the labourers was in the hands\r\nof Henry Hunt, a man whose wisdom was not equal to his courage, and\r\nwhose egregious vanity demoralised and spoilt his natural eloquence.\r\nIf those who were in close sympathy with his general aims could not\r\ntolerate his manners, it is not surprising that his advocacy was a\r\ndoubtful recommendation in the unsympathetic atmosphere of the House\r\nof Commons. He was a man of passionate sincerity, and had already\r\nbeen twice in prison for his opinions, but the ruling class thinking\r\nitself on the brink of a social catastrophe, while very conscious of\r\nHunt’s defects, was in no mood to take a detached view of this virtue.\r\nThe debate, which took place on the 8th of February 1831, reflects\r\nlittle credit on the House of Commons, and the division still less,\r\nfor Hume was Hunt’s only supporter. The chief speakers against the\r\nmotion were Benett of Wiltshire, George Lamb, brother of Melbourne and\r\nUnder-Secretary at the Home Office, and Denman, the Attorney-General.\r\nLamb amused himself and the House with jests on the illiterate letter\r\nfor writing which the boy Looker was then on the high seas, and Denman\r\nthrew out a suggestion that Looker’s father had had a share in the\r\nboy’s guilt. Denman closed his speech by pouring scorn on those who\r\ntalked sentimentality, and declaring that he would ever look back with\r\npride on his part in the scenes of this memorable winter.\r\n\r\nSo far the Government had had it all their own way. But in their\r\nanxiety to show a resolute front and to reassure those who had\r\nsuspected that a reform Government would encourage social disorder by\r\nweakness, Lord Grey and his colleagues were drawn into a scrape in\r\nwhich they burnt their fingers rather badly. They decided to prosecute\r\ntwo writers for inciting the labourers to rebel. The two writers were\r\nRichard Carlile and William Cobbett. Carlile was the natural prey for\r\na Government in search of a victim. He had already spent six or seven\r\nyears of his lion-hearted life in prison for publishing the writings\r\nof Paine and Hone: his wife, his sister, and his shopman had all paid\r\na similar penalty for their association, voluntary or involuntary,\r\nwith his public-spirited adventures. The document for which he stood\r\nin the dock at the Old Bailey early in January 1831 was an address to\r\nthe agricultural labourers, praising them for what they had done, and\r\nreviewing their misfortunes in this sentence: ‘The more tame you have\r\ngrown, the more you have been oppressed and despised, the more you have\r\nbeen trampled on.’ Carlile defended himself in a speech that lasted\r\nfour hours and a half. The jury disagreed, but after several hours they\r\nunited on a verdict of acquittal on the charge of bringing the Crown\r\ninto contempt, and of guilty on the charge of addressing inflammatory\r\nlanguage to the labouring classes. He was sentenced to imprisonment for\r\ntwo years, to pay a fine, and to find sureties.\r\n\r\nCobbett’s trial was a more important event, for whereas Carlile was the\r\nDon Quixote of liberty of mind, Cobbett was a great political force,\r\nand his acquittal would give a very serious shock to the prestige of\r\nthe Government that attacked him. The attention of the authorities\r\nhad been called to Cobbett’s speeches very early in the history of the\r\nriots, and the Home Office Papers show that appeals to the Government\r\nto prosecute Cobbett were the most common of all the recommendations\r\nand requests that poured into Whitehall from the country. Some of these\r\nletters were addressed to Sir Robert Peel, and one of them is endorsed\r\nwith the draft of a reply: ‘My dear Sir,--If you can give me the name\r\nof the person who heard Cobbett make use of the expression to which you\r\nrefer you would probably enable me to render no small public service by\r\nthe prosecution of Cobbett for sedition.--Very faithfully Yours, Robert\r\nPeel.’\r\n\r\nIn an evil moment for themselves, Peel’s successors decided to take\r\naction, not indeed on his speeches, but on his articles in the\r\n_Political Register_. The character of those articles might perhaps be\r\ndescribed as militant and uncompromising truth. They were inflammatory,\r\nbecause the truth was inflammatory. Nobody who knew the condition\r\nof the labourers could have found in them a single misstatement or\r\nexaggeration. The only question was whether it was in the public\r\ninterest to publish them in a time of disturbance. From this point of\r\nview the position of the Government was seriously weakened by the fact\r\nthat the _Times_ had used language on this very subject which was not\r\none whit less calculated to excite indignation against the rich, and\r\nthe _Times_, though it was the organ of wealthy men, was in point of\r\nfact considerably cheaper to buy than the _Register_, the price of\r\nwhich Cobbett had raised to a shilling in the autumn of 1830. But this\r\nwas not the only reason why the Government was in danger of exposing\r\nitself to a charge of malice in choosing Cobbett for a prosecution.\r\nThe unrest in the southern counties had been due to a special set of\r\neconomic causes, but there was unrest due to other causes in other\r\nparts of England. It was not the misery of ploughboys and labourers\r\nin Hampshire and Kent that had made Wellington and Peel decide that\r\nit was unsafe for the King to dine at the Guildhall in the winter of\r\n1830: the Political Unions, which struck such terror into the Court and\r\nthe politicians, were not bred in the villages. There was a general\r\nand acute discontent with extravagant government, with swollen lists\r\nand the burden of sinecures, with the whole system of the control of\r\nthe boroughs and its mockery of representation. Now in such a state\r\nof opinion every paper on the side of reform might be charged with\r\nspreading unrest. Statistics of sinecures, and pensions, and the fat\r\nrevenues of bishopricks, were scattered all over England, and the\r\nfacts published in every such sheet were like sparks thrown about near\r\na powder magazine. The private citizens who wrote to the Home Office\r\nin the winter of 1830 mentioned these papers almost as often as they\r\nmentioned Cobbett’s lectures. Many of these papers were based on a\r\npamphlet written by Sir James Graham, First Lord of the Admiralty\r\nin the very Government that prosecuted Cobbett. One of the Barings\r\ncomplained in the House of Commons in December 1830, that the official\r\npapers on offices and sinecures which the Reform Government had itself\r\npresented to Parliament to satisfy public opinion of its sincerity in\r\nthe cause of retrenchment were the cause of mischief and danger. At\r\nsuch a time no writer, who wished to help the cause of reform, could\r\nmeasure the effects of every sentence so nicely as to escape the charge\r\nof exciting passion, and the Government was guilty of an extraordinary\r\npiece of folly in attacking Cobbett for conduct of which their own\r\nchief supporters were guilty every time they put a pen to paper.\r\n\r\nThe trial took place in July 1831 at the Guildhall. It was the great\r\ntriumph of Cobbett’s life, as his earlier trial had been his great\r\nhumiliation. There was very little of the lion in the Cobbett who\r\nfaltered before Vicary Gibbs in 1810; there was very little of the lamb\r\nin the Cobbett who towered before Denman in 1831. And the court that\r\nwitnessed his triumph presented a strange scene. The trial had excited\r\nintense interest, and Cobbett said that every county in England was\r\nrepresented in the company that broke, from time to time, into storms\r\nof cheering. The judge was Tenterden, the Chief Justice, who, as a\r\nbitter enemy of reform, hated alike accusers and accused. Six members\r\nof the Cabinet, the Prime Minister himself and the Lord Chancellor,\r\nMelbourne and Durham, Palmerston and Goderich listened, from no choice\r\nof their own, to the scathing speech in which Cobbett reviewed their\r\nconduct. Benett of Pyt House was there, a spectre of vengeance from one\r\nCommission, and the father of the boy Cook of Micheldever, a shadow of\r\ndeath from another. All the memories of those terrible weeks seemed\r\nto gather together in the suspense of that eager crowd watching this\r\nmomentous encounter.\r\n\r\nDenman, who prosecuted, employed a very different tone towards Cobbett\r\nfrom the tone that Perceval had used at the first of Cobbett’s trials.\r\nPerceval, when prosecuting Cobbett for some articles on Ireland in\r\nthe _Register_ in 1803, asked the jury with the patrician insolence\r\nof a class that held all the prizes of life, ‘Gentlemen, who is Mr.\r\nCobbett? Is he a man writing purely from motives of patriotism? _Quis\r\nhomo hic est? Quo patre natus?_’ No counsel prosecuting Cobbett\r\ncould open with this kind of rhetoric in 1831: Denman preferred to\r\ndescribe him as ‘one of the greatest masters of the English language.’\r\nDenman’s speech was brief, and it was confined mainly to a paraphrase\r\nof certain of Cobbett’s articles and to comments upon their effect.\r\nIt was no difficult task to pick out passages which set the riots\r\nin a very favourable light, and emphasised the undoubted fact that\r\nthey had brought some improvement in the social conditions, and that\r\nnothing else had moved the heart or the fears of the ruling class.\r\nBut the speech was not long over before it became evident that\r\nCobbett, like another great political defendant, though beginning as\r\nthe accused, was to end as the accuser. His reply to the charge of\r\nexciting the labourers to violence was immediate and annihilating.\r\nIn December 1830, after the publication of the article for which\r\nhe was now being tried, Brougham, as President of the Society for\r\nthe Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, had asked and obtained Cobbett’s\r\nleave to reprint his earlier ‘Letter to the Luddites,’ as the most\r\nlikely means of turning the labourers from rioting and the breaking\r\nof machines. There stood the Lord Chancellor in the witness-box, in\r\nanswer to Cobbett’s subpœna, to admit that crushing fact. This was a\r\nthunderclap to Denman, who was quite ignorant of what Brougham had\r\ndone, and, as we learn from Greville, he knew at once that his case\r\nwas hopeless. Cobbett passed rapidly from defence to attack. Grey,\r\nMelbourne, Palmerston, Durham, and Goderich had all been subpœna’d in\r\norder to answer some very awkward questions as to the circumstances\r\nunder which Thomas Goodman had been pardoned. The Lord Chief Justice\r\nrefused to allow the questions to be put, but at least these great\r\nMinisters had to listen as Cobbett told the story of those strange\r\ntransactions, including a visit from a parson and magistrates to a ‘man\r\nwith a rope round his neck,’ which resulted in Goodman’s unexplained\r\npardon and the publication of a statement purporting to come from\r\nhim ascribing his conduct to the incitement at Cobbett’s ‘lacture.’\r\nCobbett destroyed any effect that Goodman’s charge might have had\r\nby producing a declaration signed by one hundred and three persons\r\npresent at the lecture--farmers, tradesmen, labourers, carpenters,\r\nand shoemakers--denying that Cobbett had made the statement ascribed\r\nto him in Goodman’s confession, one of the signatories being the\r\nfarmer whose barn Goodman had burnt. He then proceeded to contrast the\r\ntreatment Goodman had received with the treatment received by others\r\nconvicted of incendiarism, and piecing together all the evidence of\r\nthe machinations of the magistrates, constructed a very formidable\r\nindictment to which Denman could only reply that he knew nothing of\r\nthe matter, and that Cobbett was capable of entertaining the most\r\nabsurd suspicions. On another question Denman found himself thrown on\r\nthe defensive, for he was now confronted with his own misstatements\r\nin Parliament about Cook, and the affidavits of Cook’s father present\r\nin court. Denman could only answer that till that day no one had\r\ncontradicted him, though he could scarcely have been unaware that the\r\nHouse of Commons was not the place in which a Minister’s statement\r\nabout the age, occupation, pay, and conduct of an obscure boy was\r\nmost likely to be challenged. Denman made a chastened reply, and the\r\njury, after spending the night at the Guildhall, disagreed, six voting\r\neach way. Cobbett was a free man, for the Whigs, overwhelmed by the\r\ninvective they had foolishly provoked, remembered, when too late, the\r\nwise saying of Maurice of Saxony about Charles V.: ‘I have no cage big\r\nenough for such a bird,’ and resisted all the King’s invitations to\r\nrepeat their rash adventure. To those who have made their melancholy\r\nway through the trials at Winchester and Salisbury, at which rude boys\r\nfrom the Hampshire villages and the Wiltshire Downs, about to be tossed\r\nacross the sea, stood shelterless in the unpitying storm of question\r\nand insinuation and abuse, there is a certain grim satisfaction in\r\nreading this last chapter and watching Denman face to face, not with\r\nthe broken excuses and appeals of ignorant and helpless peasants, but\r\nwith a volleyed thunder that swept into space all his lawyer’s artifice\r\nand skill. Justice plays strange tricks upon mankind, but who will say\r\nthat she has not her inspirations?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne more incident has to be recorded in the tale of suppression.\r\nThe riots were over, but the fires continued. In the autumn of 1831\r\nMelbourne, in a shameful moment, proposed a remedy borrowed from the\r\nevil practices which a Tory Parliament had consented at last to forbid.\r\nThe setting of spring guns and man-traps, the common device of game\r\npreservers, had been made a misdemeanour in 1826 by an Act of which\r\nSuffield was the author. Melbourne now proposed to allow persons who\r\nobtained a license from two magistrates to protect their property by\r\nthese means. The Bill passed the House of Lords, and the _Journals_\r\nrecord that it was introduced in the House of Commons, but there, let\r\nus hope from very horror at the thought of this moral relapse, silently\r\nit disappears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Grey met Parliament as Prime Minister he said that the Government\r\nrecognised two duties: the duty of finding a remedy for the distress\r\nof the labourers, and the duty of repressing the riots with severity\r\nand firmness. We have seen how the riots were suppressed; we have now\r\nto see what was done towards providing a remedy. This side of the\r\npicture is scarcely less melancholy than the other; for when we turn\r\nto the debates in Parliament we see clearly how hopeless it was to\r\nexpect any solution of an economic problem from the legislators of the\r\ntime. Now, if ever, circumstances had forced the problem on the mind of\r\nParliament, and in such an emergency as this men might be trusted to\r\nsay seriously and sincerely what they had to suggest. Yet the debates\r\nare a mêlée of futile generalisations, overshadowed by the doctrine\r\nwhich Grey himself laid down that ‘all matters respecting the amount\r\nof rent and the extent of farms would be much better regulated by the\r\nindividuals who were immediately interested than by any Committee of\r\ntheir Lordships.’ One peer got into trouble for blurting out the truth\r\nthat the riots had raised wages; another would curse machinery as\r\nvigorously as any labourer; many blamed the past inattention of the\r\nHouse of Lords to the labourers’ misery; and one considered the first\r\nnecessity of the moment was the impeachment of Wellington. Two men had\r\nactual and serious proposals to make. They were Lord King and Lord\r\nSuffield.\r\n\r\nBoth of these men are striking figures. King (1776-1833) was an\r\neconomist who had startled the Government in 1811 by calling for the\r\npayments of his rents in the lawful coin of the realm. This dramatic\r\nmanœuvre for discrediting paper money had been thwarted by Lord\r\nStanhope, who, though in agreement with King on many subjects, strongly\r\napproved of paper money in England as he had approved of assignats in\r\nFrance. Lord Holland tells a story of how he twitted Stanhope with\r\nwanting to see history repeat itself, and how Stanhope answered with\r\na chuckle: ‘And if they take property from the drones and give it to\r\nthe bees, where, my dear Citoyen, is the great harm of that?’ King\r\nwas always in a small minority and his signature was given, together\r\nwith those of Albemarle, Thanet, and Holland, to the protest against\r\nestablishing martial law in Ireland in 1801, which was written with\r\nsuch wounding directness that it was afterwards blackened out of the\r\nrecords of the House of Lords, on the motion of the infamous Lord\r\nClare. But he was never in a smaller minority than he was on this\r\noccasion when he told his fellow landlords that the only remedy for the\r\npublic distress was the abolition of the Corn Laws. Such a proposal\r\nstood no chance in the House of Lords or in the House of Commons.\r\nGrey declared that the abolition of the Corn Laws would lead to the\r\ndestruction of the country, and though there were Free Traders among\r\nthe Whigs, even nine years after this Melbourne described such a policy\r\nas ‘the wildest and maddest scheme that has ever entered into the\r\nimagination of man to conceive.’\r\n\r\nSuffield (1781-1835), the only other politician with a remedy, is\r\nan interesting and attractive character. Originally a Tory, and\r\nthe son of Sir Harbord Harbord, who was not a man of very tender\r\nsensibilities, Suffield gradually felt his way towards Liberalism. He\r\nwas too large-minded a man to be happy and at ease in an atmosphere\r\nwhere the ruling class flew instinctively in every crisis to measures\r\nof tyranny and repression. Peterloo completed his conversion. From\r\nthat time he became a champion of the poor, a fierce critic of the\r\nGame Laws, and a strong advocate of prison reform. He is revealed in\r\nhis diary and all the traditions of his life as a man of independence\r\nand great sincerity. Suffield’s policy in this crisis was the policy\r\nof home colonisation, and its fate can best be described by means of\r\nextracts from a memoir prepared by R. M. Bacon, a Norwich journalist\r\nand publicist of importance, and printed privately in 1838, three years\r\nafter Suffield had been killed by a fall from his horse. They give a\r\nfar more intimate and graphic picture of the mind of the Government\r\nthan the best reported debates in the records of Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in a previous chapter that there had been at this time a\r\nrevival of the movement for restoring the land to the labourers. One\r\nof the chief supporters of this policy was R. M. Bacon, who, as editor\r\nof the _Norwich Mercury_, was in close touch with Suffield. Bacon set\r\nout an elaborate scheme of home colonisation, resembling in its main\r\nideas the plan sketched by Arthur Young thirty years earlier, and this\r\nscheme Suffield took up with great enthusiasm. Its chief recommendation\r\nin his eyes was that it applied public money to establishing labourers\r\nwith a property of their own, so that whereas, under the existing\r\nsystem, public money was used, in the form of subsidies from the rates,\r\nto depress wages, public money would be used under this scheme to\r\nraise them. For it was the object of the plan to make the labourers\r\nindependent of the farmers, and to substitute the competition of\r\nemployers for the competition of employed. No other scheme, Suffield\r\nused to maintain, promised any real relief. If rents and taxes were\r\nreduced the farmer would be able, but would not be compelled, to give\r\nbetter wages: if taxes on the labourers’ necessaries were reduced,\r\nthe labourers would be able to live on a smaller wage, and as long as\r\nthey were scrambling for employment they were certain to be ground\r\ndown to the minimum of subsistence. The only way to rescue them from\r\nthis plight was to place them again in such a position that they were\r\nnot absolutely dependent on the farmers. This the Government could do\r\nby purchasing land, at present waste, and compelling parishes, with\r\nthe help of a public loan, to set up labourers upon it, and to build\r\ncottages with a fixed allotment of land.\r\n\r\nSuffield’s efforts to persuade the Government to take up this\r\nconstructive policy began as soon as Grey came into office. His\r\nfirst letters to Bacon on the subject are written in November. The\r\nopposition, he says, is very strong, and Sturges Bourne and Lansdowne\r\nare both hostile. On 17th November he writes that a peer had told him\r\nthat he had sat on an earlier committee on this subject with Sturges\r\nBourne, as chairman, and that ‘those who understood the subject best\r\nagreed with Malthus that vice and misery alone could _cure_ the evil.’\r\nOn 19th November he writes that he has had a conference with Brougham,\r\nwith about the same success as his conference with Lansdowne and\r\nSturges Bourne. On the 23rd he writes that he has been promised an\r\ninterview at the Home Office; on the 25th ‘no invitation from Lord\r\nMelbourne----the truth is he cannot find one moment of leisure. The\r\nHome Office is distracted by the numerous representations of imminent\r\ndanger to property, if not to life, and applications for protection.’\r\nLater in the same day he writes that he has seen both Grey and\r\nMelbourne: ‘I at once attacked Grey. I found him disposed to give every\r\npossible consideration to the matter. He himself has in Northumberland\r\nseen upon his own property the beneficent effects of my plan, namely\r\nof apportioning land to cottagers, but he foresaw innumerable\r\ndifficulties.’ A House of Lords Committee had been appointed on the\r\nPoor Laws at the instance of Lord Salisbury, and Suffield hoped to\r\npersuade this committee to report in favour of his scheme. He therefore\r\npressed Grey to make a public statement of sympathy. Grey said ‘he\r\nwould intimate that Government would be disposed to carry into effect\r\nany measure of relief recommended by the Committee; very pressed but\r\nwould call Cabinet together to-morrow.’ The interview with Melbourne\r\nwas very different. ‘Next I saw Lord Melbourne. “Oppressed as you\r\nare,” said I, “I am willing to relieve you from a conference, but you\r\nmust say something on Monday next and I fear you have not devoted much\r\nattention to the subject.” “I understand it perfectly,” he replied,\r\n“and that is the reason for my saying nothing about it.” “How is this\r\nto be explained?” “Because I consider it hopeless.” “Oh, you think\r\nwith Malthus that vice and misery are the only cure?” “No,” said Lord\r\nMelbourne, “but the evil is in numbers and the sort of competition that\r\nensues.” “Well then I have measures to propose which may meet this\r\ndifficulty.” “Of these,” said Lord Melbourne, “I know nothing,” and\r\nhe turned away from me to a friend to enquire respecting outrages.’\r\nSuffield concludes on a melancholy note: ‘The fact is, with the\r\nexception of a few individuals, the subject is deemed by the world\r\na bore: every one who touches on it is a bore, and nothing but the\r\nstrongest conviction of its importance to the country would induce me\r\nto subject myself to the indifference that I daily experience when I\r\nventure to intrude the matter on the attention of legislators.’\r\n\r\nA fortnight later Suffield was very sanguine: ‘Most satisfactory\r\ninterview with Melbourne: thinks Lord Grey will do the job in the\r\nrecess.’ But the sky soon darkens again, and on the 27th Suffield\r\nwrites strongly to Melbourne on the necessity of action, and he adds:\r\n‘Tranquillity being now restored, all the farmers are of course\r\nreducing their wages to that miserable rate that led to the recent\r\ndisturbances.’ Unhappily the last sentence had a significance which\r\nperhaps escaped Suffield. Believing as he did in his scheme, he\r\nthought that its necessity was proved by the relapse of wages on the\r\nrestoration of tranquillity, but vice and misery-ridden politicians\r\nmight regard the restoration of tranquillity as an argument for\r\ndropping the scheme. After this the first hopes fade away. There is\r\nstrong opposition on the Select Committee to Suffield’s views, and he\r\nis disappointed of the prompt report in favour of action which he\r\nhad expected from it. The Government are indisposed to take action,\r\nand Suffield, growing sick and impatient of their slow clocks, warns\r\nMelbourne in June that he cannot defend them. Melbourne replies that\r\nsuch a measure could not be maturely considered or passed during the\r\nagitation over the Reform Bill. Later in the month there was a meeting\r\nbetween Suffield and Melbourne, of which unfortunately no record is\r\npreserved in the Memoir, with the result that Suffield declared in\r\nParliament that the Government had a plan. In the autumn of 1831 an\r\nAct was placed on the Statute Book which was the merest mockery of all\r\nSuffield’s hopes, empowering churchwardens or overseers to hire or\r\nlease, and under certain conditions to enclose, land up to a limit of\r\nfifty acres, for the employment of the poor. It is difficult to resist\r\nthe belief that if the riots had lasted longer they might have forced\r\nthe Government to accept the scheme, in the efficacy of which it had\r\nno faith, as the price of peace, and that the change in temperature\r\nrecorded in Suffield’s _Diary_ after the middle of December marks the\r\nrestoration of confidence at Whitehall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo perished the last hope of reform and reparation for the poor. The\r\nlabourers’ revolt was ended; and four hundred and fifty men had spent\r\ntheir freedom in vain. Of these exiles we have one final glimpse; it is\r\nin a letter from the Governor of Van Diemen’s Land to Lord Goderich:\r\n‘If, my Lord, the evidence, or conduct, of particular individuals,\r\ncan be relied on as proof of the efficiency or non-efficiency of\r\ntransportation, I am sure that a strong case indeed could be made\r\nout in its favour. I might instance the rioters who arrived by the\r\n_Eliza_, several of whom died almost immediately from disease, induced\r\napparently by despair. A great many of them went about dejected and\r\nstupefied with care and grief, and their situation after assignment was\r\nnot for a long time much less unhappy.’[486]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[449] Russell, _On Crimes and Misdemeanours_, p. 371.\r\n\r\n[450] Sir J.

The secret of this charm is not to be found in any\r\nspecial beauty or nobility of design or expression, but simply in an\r\nexquisite fitness. The eighteenth-century mind was a unity, an order;\r\nit was finished, and it was simple. All literature and art that really\r\nbelong to the eighteenth century are the language of a little society\r\nof men and women who moved within one set of ideas; who understood each\r\nother; who were not tormented by any anxious or bewildering problems;\r\nwho lived in comfort, and, above all things, in composure. The classics\r\nwere their freemasonry. There was a standard for the mind, for the\r\nemotions, for the taste: there were no incongruities. When you have a\r\nsociety like this, you have what we roughly call a civilisation, and\r\nit leaves its character and canons in all its surroundings and its\r\nliterature. Its definite ideas lend themselves readily to expression.\r\nA larger society seems an anarchy in contrast; just because of its\r\nescape into a greater world it seems powerless to stamp itself on\r\nwood or stone; it is condemned as an age of chaos and mutiny, with\r\nnothing to declare. In comparison with the dishevelled century that\r\nfollows, the eighteenth century was neat, well dressed and nicely\r\nappointed. It had a religion, the religion of quiet common sense and\r\ncontentment with a world that it found agreeable and encouraging; it\r\nhad a style, the style of the elegant and polished English of Addison\r\nor Gibbon. Men who were not conscious of any strain or great emotion\r\nasked of their writers and their painters that they should observe in\r\ntheir art the equanimity and moderation that were desirable in life.\r\nThey did not torture their minds with eager questions; there was no\r\npiercing curiosity or passionate love or hatred in their souls; they\r\nall breathed the same air of distinguished satisfaction and dignified\r\nself-control. English institutions suited them admirably; a monarchy so\r\nreasonable nobody could mind; Parliament was a convenient instrument\r\nfor their wishes, and the English Church was the very thing to keep\r\nreligion in its place. What this atmosphere could produce at its best\r\nwas seen in Gibbon or in Reynolds; and neither Gibbon nor Reynolds\r\ncould lose themselves in a transport of the imagination. To pass from\r\nthe eighteenth century to the Revolt, from Pope to Blake, or from\r\nSheridan to Shelley, is to burst from this little hothouse of sheltered\r\nand nurtured elegance into an infinite wild garden of romance and\r\nmystery. For the eighteenth century such escape was impossible, and if\r\nany one fell into the fatal crime of enthusiasm, his frenzy took the\r\nform of Methodism, which was a more limited world than the world he had\r\nquitted.\r\n\r\nThe small class that enjoyed the monopoly of political power and social\r\nluxuries, round whose interests and pleasures the State revolved,\r\nconsisted, down to the French war, of persons accustomed to travel, to\r\nfind amusement and instruction in foreign galleries and French salons,\r\nand to study the fashions and changes of thought, and letters and\r\nreligion, outside England; of persons who liked to surround themselves\r\nwith the refinements and the decorations of life, and to display their\r\ngood taste in collecting old masters, or fine fragments of sculpture,\r\nor the scattered treasures of an ancient library. Perhaps at no time\r\nsince the days when Isabella d’Este consoled herself for the calamities\r\nof her friends and relatives with the thought of the little Greek\r\nstatues that were brought by these calamities into the market, has\r\nthere been a class so keenly interested in the acquisition of beautiful\r\nworkmanship, for the sake of the acquisition rather than for the sake\r\nof the renown of acquiring it. The eighteenth-century collectors\r\nbought with discernment as well as with liberality: they were not the\r\nslaves of a single rage or passion, and consequently they enriched\r\nthe mansions of England with the achievements of various schools.\r\nOf course the eighteenth century had its own fashion in art, and no\r\nadmiration is more unintelligible to modern taste than the admiration\r\nfor Guercino and Guido Reni and the other seventeenth-century painters\r\nof Bologna. But the pictures that came across the Channel in such great\r\nnumbers were not the products of one school, or indeed the products of\r\none country. Dutch, Flemish, French, Italian, they all streamed into\r\nEngland, and the nation suddenly found itself, or rather its rulers,\r\nvery rich in masterpieces. The importance of such a school of manners\r\nas this, with its knowledge of other worlds and other societies, its\r\ninterest in literature and art, its cosmopolitan atmosphere, can\r\nonly be truly estimated by those who remember the boorish habits of\r\nthe country gentlemen of the earlier eighteenth century described by\r\nFielding. With the French war this cosmopolitan atmosphere disappeared.\r\nThenceforth the aristocracy were as insular in their prejudices\r\nas any of their countrymen, and Lord Holland, who preserved the\r\nlarger traditions of his class, provoked suspicion and resentment by\r\ntravelling in Spain during the Peninsular War.[487]\r\n\r\nBut if the art and literature of the eighteenth century show the\r\npredominance of a class that cultivated its taste outside England, and\r\nthat regarded art and literature as mere ministers to the pleasure\r\nof a few,[488] they show also that that class had political power\r\nas well as social privileges. There is no art of the time that can\r\nbe called national either in England or in France, but the art of\r\neighteenth-century England bears a less distant relation to the English\r\npeople than the art of eighteenth-century France to the people of\r\nFrance, just in proportion as the great English houses touched the\r\nEnglish people more closely than Versailles touched the French. English\r\nart is less of mere decoration and less of mere imitation, for, though\r\nit is true that Chippendale, Sheraton, and the Adam brothers were\r\nall in one sense copying the furniture of other countries--Holland,\r\nChina, France--they all preserved a certain English strain, and it was\r\nthe flavour of the vernacular, so to speak, that saved their designs\r\nfrom the worst foreign extravagance. They were designing, indeed, for\r\na class and not for a nation, but it was for a class that had never\r\nbroken quite away from the life of the society that it controlled.\r\nThe English aristocracy remained a race of country gentlemen. They\r\nnever became mere loungers or triflers, kicking their heels about a\r\nCourt and amusing themselves with tedious gallantries and intrigues.\r\nThey threw themselves into country life and government, and they were\r\nhappiest away from London. The great swarms of guests that settled on\r\nsuch country seats as Holkham were like gay and boisterous schoolboys\r\ncompared with the French nobles who had forgotten how to live in the\r\ncountry, and were tired of living at Versailles. If anything could\r\nexceed Grey’s reluctance to leave his great house in Northumberland\r\nfor the excitements of Parliament, it was Fox’s reluctance to leave\r\nhis little house in Surrey. The taste for country pleasures and for\r\ncountry sports was never lost, and its persistence explains the\r\nphysical vitality of the aristocracy. This was a social fact of great\r\nimportance, for it is health after all that wins half the battles of\r\nclasses. No quantity of Burgundy and Port could kill off a race that\r\nwas continually restoring its health by life in the open air; it did\r\nnot matter that Squire Western generally spent the night under the\r\ntable if he generally spent the day in the saddle. This inheritance of\r\nan open-air life is probably the reason that in England, in contrast\r\nto France and Italy, good looks are more often to be found in the\r\naristocracy than in other classes of society.\r\n\r\nIt was due to this physical vigour that the aristocracy, corrupt and\r\nselfish though it was, never fell into the supreme vice of moral\r\ndecadence. The other European aristocracies crumbled at once before\r\nNapoleon: the English aristocracy, amidst all its blunders and errors,\r\nkept its character for endurance and fortitude. Throughout that long\r\nstruggle, when Napoleon was strewing Europe with his triumphs and, as\r\nSheridan said, making kings the sentinels of his power, England alone\r\nnever broke a treaty or made a surrender at his bidding. For ten years\r\nPitt seems the one fixed point among the rulers of Europe. It is not,\r\nof course, to be argued that the ruling class showed more valour and\r\ndetermination than any other class of Englishmen would have shown: the\r\nempire-builders of the century, men of daring and enterprise on distant\r\nfrontiers, were not usually of the ruling class, and Dr. Johnson once\r\nwrote an essay to explain why it was that the English common soldier\r\nwas the bravest of the common soldiers of the world. The comparison\r\nis between the English aristocracy and the other champions of law and\r\norder in the great ordeal of this war, and in that comparison the\r\nEnglish aristocracy stands out in conspicuous eminence in a Europe of\r\nshifting and melting governments.\r\n\r\nThe politics of a small class of privileged persons enjoying an\r\nundisputed power might easily have degenerated into a mere business of\r\nmoney-making and nothing else. There is plenty of this atmosphere in\r\nthe eighteenth-century system: a study merely of the society memoirs\r\nof the age is enough to dissipate the fine old illusion that men of\r\nblood and breeding have a nice and fastidious sense about money. Just\r\nthe opposite is the truth. Aristocracies have had their virtues, but\r\nthe virtue of a magnificent disdain for money is not to be expected in\r\na class which has for generations taken it as a matter of course that\r\nit should be maintained by the State. At no time in English history\r\nhave sordid motives been so conspicuous in politics as during the days\r\nwhen power was most a monopoly of the aristocracy. No politicians\r\nhave sacrificed so much of their time, ability, and principles to the\r\npursuit of gain as the politicians of the age when poor men could only\r\nsqueeze into politics by twos or threes in a generation, when the\r\naristocracy put whole families into the House of Commons as a matter\r\nof course, and Burke boasted that the House of Lords was wholly, and\r\nthe House of Commons was mainly, composed for the defence of hereditary\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nBut the politics of the eighteenth century are not a mere scramble\r\nfor place and power. An age which produced the two Pitts could not be\r\ncalled an age of mere avarice. An age which produced Burke and Fox\r\nand Grey could not be called an age of mere ambition. The politics of\r\nthis little class are illuminated by the great and generous behaviour\r\nof individuals. If England was the only country where the ruling\r\nclass made a stand against Napoleon, England was the only country\r\nwhere members of the ruling class were found to make a stand for the\r\nideas of the Revolution. Perhaps the proudest boast that the English\r\noligarchy can make is the boast that some of its members, nursed as\r\nthey had been in a soft and feathered world of luxury and privilege,\r\ncould look without dismay on what Burke called the strange, wild,\r\nnameless, enthusiastic thing established in the centre of Europe. The\r\nspectacle of Fox and Sheridan and Grey leading out their handful of\r\nLiberals night after night against the Treason and Sedition Bills, at a\r\ntime when an avalanche of terror had overwhelmed the mind of England,\r\nwhen Pitt, Burke, and Dundas thought no malice too poisoned, Gillray\r\nand Rowlandson no deforming touch of the brush too brutal, when the\r\nupper classes thought they were going to lose their property, and the\r\nmiddle classes thought they were going to lose their religion, is one\r\nof the sublime spectacles of history. This quality of fearlessness\r\nin the defence of great causes is displayed in a fine succession\r\nof characters and incidents; Chatham, whose courage in facing his\r\ncountry’s dangers was not greater than his courage in blaming his\r\ncountry’s crimes; Burke, with his elaborate rage playing round the\r\ndazzling renown of a Rodney; Fox, whose voice sounds like thunder\r\ncoming over the mountains, hurled at the whole race of conquerors;\r\nHolland, pleading almost alone for the abolition of capital punishment\r\nfor stealing before a bench of bishops; a man so little given to\r\nrevolutionary sympathies as Fitzwilliam, leaving his lord-lieutenancy\r\nrather than condone the massacre of Peterloo. If moral courage is the\r\npower of combating and defying an enveloping atmosphere of prejudice,\r\npassion, and panic, a generation which was poor in most of the public\r\nvirtues was, at least, conspicuously rich in one. Foreign policy, the\r\ntreatment of Ireland, of India, of slaves, are beyond the scope of\r\nthis book, but in glancing at the class whose treatment of the English\r\npoor has been the subject of our study, it is only just to record\r\nthat in other regions of thought and conduct they bequeathed a great\r\ninheritance of moral and liberal ideas: a passion for justice between\r\npeoples, a sense for national freedom, a great body of principle by\r\nwhich to check, refine, and discipline the gross appetites of national\r\nambition. Those ideas were the ideas of a minority, but they were\r\nexpressed and defended with an eloquence and a power that have made\r\nthem an important and a glorious part of English history. In all this\r\ndevelopment of liberal doctrine it is not fanciful to see the ennobling\r\ninfluence of the Greek writers on whom every eighteenth-century\r\npolitician was bred and nourished.\r\n\r\nFox thought in the bad days of the war with the Revolution that his\r\nown age resembled the age of Cicero, and that Parliamentary government\r\nin England, undermined by the power of the Court, would disappear\r\nlike liberty in republican Rome. There is a strange letter in which,\r\ncondoling with Grey on his father’s becoming a peer, he remarks that\r\nit matters the less because the House of Commons will soon cease to be\r\nof any importance. This prediction was falsified, and England never\r\nproduced a Cæsar. There is, however, a real analogy in the social\r\nhistory of the two periods. The English ruling class corresponds to\r\nthe Roman senatorial order, both classes claiming office on the same\r\nground of family title, a Cavendish being as inevitable as a Claudius,\r\nand an Æmilius as a Gower. The _equites_ were the second rank of the\r\nRoman social aristocracy, as the manufacturers or bankers were of the\r\nEnglish. A Roman _eques_ could pass into the senatorial order by\r\nholding the quæstorship; an English manufacturer could pass into the\r\ngoverning class by buying an estate. The English aristocracy, like the\r\nRoman, looked a little doubtfully on new-comers, and even a Cicero or a\r\nCanning might complain of the freezing welcome of the old nobles; but\r\nit preferred to use rather than to exclude them.\r\n\r\nIn both societies the aristocracy regarded the poor in much the\r\nsame spirit, as a problem of discipline and order, and passed on to\r\nposterity the same vague suggestion of squalor and turbulence. Thus\r\nit comes that most people who think of the poor in the Roman Republic\r\nthink only of the great corn largesses; and most people who think of\r\nthe poor in eighteenth-century England think only of the great system\r\nof relief from the rates. Mr. Warde Fowler has shown how hard it is to\r\nfind in the Roman writers any records of the poor. So it is with the\r\nrecords of eighteenth-century England. In both societies the obscurity\r\nwhich surrounded the poor in life has settled on their wrongs in\r\nhistory. For one person who knows anything about so immense an event\r\nas the disappearance of the old English village society, there are\r\na hundred who know everything about the fashionable scenes of high\r\npolitics and high play, that formed the exciting world of the upper\r\nclasses. The silence that shrouds these village revolutions was not\r\nquite unbroken, but the cry that disturbed it is like a noise that\r\nbreaks for a moment on the night, and then dies away, only serving to\r\nmake the stillness deeper and more solemn. The _Deserted Village_ is\r\nknown wherever the English language is spoken, but Goldsmith’s critics\r\nhave been apt to treat it, as Dr. Johnson treated it, as a beautiful\r\npiece of irrelevant pathos, and his picture of what was happening in\r\nEngland has been admired as a picture of what was happening in his\r\ndiscolouring dreams. Macaulay connected that picture with reality in\r\nhis ingenious theory, that England provided the village of the happy\r\nand smiling opening, and Ireland the village of the sombre and tragical\r\nend. One enclosure has been described in literature, and described by\r\na victim, John Clare, the Northamptonshire peasant, who drifted into\r\na madhouse through a life of want and trouble. Those who recall the\r\ndiscussions of the time, and the assumption of the upper classes that\r\nthe only question that concerned the poor was the question whether\r\nenclosure increased employment, will be struck by the genuine emotion\r\nwith which Clare dwells on the natural beauties of the village of\r\nhis childhood, and his attachment to his home and its memories. But\r\nClare’s day was brief and he has few readers.[489] In art the most\r\nundistinguished features of the most undistinguished members of the\r\naristocracy dwell in the glowing colours of a Reynolds; the poor have\r\nno heirlooms, and there was no Millet to preserve the sorrow and\r\ndespair of the homeless and dispossessed. So comfortably have the rich\r\nsoothed to sleep the sensibilities of history. These debonair lords who\r\nsmile at us from the family galleries do not grudge us our knowledge of\r\nthe escapades at Brooks’s or at White’s in which they sowed their wild\r\noats, but we fancy they are grateful for the poppy seeds of oblivion\r\nthat have been scattered over the secrets of their estates. Happy the\r\nrace that can so engage the world with its follies that it can secure\r\nrepose for its crimes.\r\n\r\nDe Quincey has compared the blotting out of a colony of Alexander’s in\r\nthe remote and unknown confines of civilisation, to the disappearance\r\nof one of those starry bodies which, fixed in longitude and latitude\r\nfor generations, are one night observed to be missing by some wandering\r\ntelescope. ‘The agonies of a perishing world have been going on,\r\nbut all is bright and silent in the heavenly host.’ So is it with\r\nthe agonies of the poor. Wilberforce, in the midst of the scenes\r\ndescribed in this volume, could declare, ‘What blessings do we enjoy\r\nin this happy country; I am reading ancient history, and the pictures\r\nit exhibits of the vices and the miseries of men fill me with mixed\r\nemotions of indignation, horror and gratitude.’ Amid the great distress\r\nthat followed Waterloo and peace, it was a commonplace of statesmen\r\nlike Castlereagh and Canning that England was the only happy country in\r\nthe world, and that so long as the monopoly of their little class was\r\nleft untouched, her happiness would survive. That class has left bright\r\nand ample records of its life in literature, in art, in political\r\ntraditions, in the display of great orations and debates, in memories\r\nof brilliant conversation and sparkling wit; it has left dim and meagre\r\nrecords of the disinherited peasants that are the shadow of its wealth;\r\nof the exiled labourers that are the shadow of its pleasures; of the\r\nvillages sinking in poverty and crime and shame that are the shadow of\r\nits power and its pride.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[487] See a remarkable letter from Lord Dudley. ‘He has already been\r\nenough on the Continent for any reasonable end, either of curiosity\r\nor instruction, and his availing himself so immediately of this\r\nopportunity to go to a foreign country again looks a little too much\r\nlike distaste for his own.’--Letters to Ivy from the first Earl of\r\nDudley, October 1808.\r\n\r\n[488] See on this subject a very interesting article by Mr. L. March\r\nPhillipps in the _Contemporary Review_, August 1911.\r\n\r\n[489] Helpstone was enclosed by an Act of 1809. Clare was then sixteen\r\nyears old. His association with the old village life had been intimate,\r\nfor he had tended geese and sheep on the common, and he had learnt the\r\nold country songs from the last village cowherd. His poem on Helpstone\r\nwas published in 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A (1)\r\n\r\n The information about Parliamentary Proceedings in Appendix A is taken\r\n from the _Journals_ of the House of Commons or of the House of Lords\r\n for the dates mentioned.

Leave given, bill\r\npresented March 15.\r\n\r\n_March 28._--Petition against the bill from various owners and\r\nproprietors of Messuages, Cottages, Lands and Tenements who ‘by virtue\r\nthereof, or otherwise, have an indisputable Right of Common upon the\r\nsaid Moor,’ stating that ‘they conceive that an Inclosure of the said\r\nMoor and Waste Ground would be productive of no Advantage to any\r\nof the Proprietors claiming a Right of Common thereon, but, on the\r\ncontrary, would very materially injure and prejudice their respective\r\nEstates in the said Townships, by laying upon the said Township the\r\nBurthen of making, maintaining, and repairing the necessary new Roads,\r\nwhich must be set out to a considerable Extent over the said Moor and\r\nWaste Ground, and also by increasing the Poors Rate, inasmuch as the\r\nPetitioners conceive that the Inhabitants of the said Town of Armley,\r\nwho are very numerous, and principally poor Manufacturers of broad\r\nWoollen Cloth, receive considerable Benefit and Advantage from the\r\npresent open State of the said Moor and Waste Ground, particularly in\r\nhaving Tenters and Frames to stretch and dry their Cloth, Warps, and\r\nWool, after it has been dyed, put up and fixed upon the said Moor and\r\nWaste Ground, which Privileges and Advantages have hitherto conduced to\r\nalleviate the Distresses and Hardships of the said poor Manufacturers\r\nin the said Township of Armley, and which, if the said Inclosure takes\r\nPlace, they will be totally deprived of and reduced to Poverty and\r\nWant.’ The Petition was ordered to be heard on second reading.\r\n\r\n_April 9._--Bill read a second time. House informed that Petitioners\r\ndeclined to be heard on second reading. The Petition was referred to\r\nthe Committee.\r\n\r\n_April 17._--(1) Petition against the bill from John Taylor, giving\r\nsame reasons as last petition. (2) Petition from various master\r\nmanufacturers of broad woollen cloth in Armley against the bill,\r\nstating that, as the Moor only contains about 160 Acres, inclosure\r\nwhich involves division ‘amongst so great a Number of Claimants in\r\nsmall Allotments,’ and also ‘the heavy and unavoidable Expenses of\r\nobtaining the Act, surveying, dividing, inclosing, and improving’\r\nwill confer little or no Benefit on the proprietors, whereas it will\r\ncertainly deprive the poor Manufacturers, who are very numerous, of (1)\r\nthe Privileges and Advantages of fixing their Tenters, etc., ‘which\r\nthey and their Ancestors have hitherto enjoyed’; and (2) ‘of that\r\nPasturage upon the said Common which they have hitherto much depended\r\nupon.’ Both Petitions to be heard at Report stage; (3) Petition against\r\nthe bill from various owners and proprietors who ‘at the Instance of\r\nseveral other Owners of Lands’ signed a petition for inclosure, ‘under\r\nan Idea, that the Inclosure would meet with the Approbation of, and\r\nbe of general Utility to the Inhabitants of the said Town,’ but now\r\nfinding that this idea was mistaken, and that Inclosure would be of\r\ngeneral disadvantage, ask that their names should be erased, and that\r\nif the bill is brought in, they should be heard against it. Petition\r\nreferred to Committee. Petitioners to be heard, ‘if they think fit’\r\n(‘they’ ambiguous, might be Committee or Petitioners).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT AND ENUMERATION OF CONSENTS.--_April 29._--Wilberforce reported\r\nfrom the Committee; Standing Orders complied with, Committee had\r\nconsidered the two petitions referred to them (apparently they had not\r\nheard Counsel), and had found that the Allegations of the Bill were\r\ntrue, and that the parties concerned had given their consent ‘(except\r\nthe Owners of Land of the Annual Value of £172, 8s. 2d. who refused to\r\nsign the Bill; and also, except the Owners of Lands of the Annual Value\r\nof £35, 15s. 9d., who declared themselves neuter; and that the Whole of\r\nthe Land entitled to Right of Common is of the Annual Value of £901,\r\n12s. 1d.).’ There is nothing to suggest that the petitioners against\r\nthe bill were heard at this stage. The Bill passed Commons and Lords.\r\nRoyal Assent, June 3, 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES OF ACT.--(Private, 33 George. III. c. 61.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONERS.--One only. William Whitelock of Brotherton, Yorks,\r\nGentleman. He is also to act as surveyor. Vacancy to be filled, if\r\nnecessary, by ‘the major part in value’ of those interested in the\r\nCommon. An arbitrator is to be appointed by the Recorder of Leeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAYMENT TO COMMISSIONER.--£1, 11s. 6d. for each working day. As\r\nsurveyor, his remuneration is to be settled by the Recorder of Leeds.\r\n\r\nCLAIMS.--The Commissioner is to hear and to determine upon all claims,\r\nbut if any one is dissatisfied the matter can be referred to the\r\nArbitrator, whose decision is final.

Lord\r\nWilliam Russell proposed to recommit the bill in order to consider this\r\npetition, but obtained only 5 votes for his motion against 51.\r\n\r\nThe Bill passed Commons.\r\n\r\nIn the Lords a Petition was read July 4, 1797, against the Bill from\r\nthe Freeholders, Copyholders, Leaseholders and Inhabitant-Freeholders\r\nof Croydon, praying their Lordships, ‘To take their Case into their\r\nmost serious Consideration.’ Petition referred to Committee.\r\n\r\n_July 10, 1797._--Bill passed Lords in a House of 4 Peers.

New Commissioners\r\nnot to be interested in the inclosure. Two Surveyors appointed by name:\r\nvacancies to be filled up by Commissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAYMENT TO COMMISSIONERS.--2 guineas a day.

If objections are raised, then\r\nany one person whose claim is disallowed, or any three persons who\r\nobject to the allowance of some one else’s claim, can proceed to trial\r\nat the Assizes on a feigned issue. The verdict of the trial is to be\r\nfinal. Due notice of trial must be given and the allotment suspended.\r\nThe Commissioners cannot determine on questions of title which may\r\nstill be tried at law.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF DIVISION--SPECIAL PROVISIONS:\r\n\r\n_Provisions for Lord of the Manor._--The Archbishop of Canterbury is\r\nLord of the Manor of Croydon and also of Waddon, and there are six\r\nother Lords whose manors lie either wholly or partly within the parish,\r\n_i.e._ (1) Robert Harris, Esq., of Bermondsey; (2) Richard Carew,\r\nEsq., of Norbury; (3) John Cator, Esq., of Bensham; (4) William Parker\r\nHamond, Esq., of Haling; (5) James Trecothick, Esq., of Addington,\r\notherwise Temple, who also claims for Bardolph and Bures. (6) The\r\nWarden and Poor of the Hospital of Holy Trinity (Whitgift Foundation)\r\nof Croham. Each of these 7 Lords is to have one-eighteenth of the\r\nCommons and Wastes lying within his Manor. But whereas James Trecothick\r\nclaims some quit-rents in the Manor of Croydon, if he makes good his\r\nclaim to the Commissioners, then the Archbishop’s eighteenth is to be\r\ndivided between James Trecothick and the Archbishop, and this is to\r\nbe taken by James Trecothick as his whole share as Lord of a Manor.\r\nThe Archbishop can also have part of Norwood Common in lieu of his due\r\nshare of Norwood woodlands.\r\n\r\nManorial rights, save Right of Soil, continue as before.\r\n\r\nCompensation for the timber in Norwood Woodlands is to be fixed by the\r\nCommissioners and paid by the allottees to the Archbishop.\r\n\r\n_Provision for Tithe Owners._--For Rectorial Tithes, such parcel or\r\nparcels as Commissioners judge to be full equivalent.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Archbishop claims that Norwood Woodlands (295 acres)\r\nare exempt from all tithes, this claim is to be determined by the\r\nCommissioners or at law, and if not found good, another parcel to be\r\nset out as full equivalent.\r\n\r\nBut the tithe allotments in all are not to equal in value more than\r\none-ninths of the Commons, marshes etc.\r\n\r\nFor Vicar’s tithes over Norwood Common, an equivalent parcel of land.\r\n\r\n_Provisions for the Poor._--If the inhabitants of Croydon prove their\r\nclaim to Rights of Common on Norwood Common, and in Norwood Commonable\r\nWoods to the satisfaction of the Commissioners, or before a Court (if\r\nit is tried at law) then the Commissioners are to set out from the\r\nCommons, Wastes, etc., as much land as they judge to be equivalent to\r\nsuch right, ‘having particular Regard to the Accommodation of Houses\r\nand Cottages contiguous to the said Commons, etc.,’ and this land is\r\nto remain common, for the use of the inhabitants of Croydon, subject\r\nto the right of getting gravel from it. Suppose, however, that the\r\ninhabitants’ claim is not allowed, or if allowed does not equal 215\r\nacres of common in value: even then the Commissioners are to set out\r\n215 acres for the above purpose. These 215 acres are to be vested in\r\nthe Vicar, Churchwardens, Overseers, and 6 Inhabitants chosen at a\r\nVestry meeting. These trustees can inclose as much as a seventh part\r\nand let it on lease for 21 years. They are to manage the common with\r\nregard to stint, etc., and to dispose of rents.\r\n\r\n_Allotment of Residue._--The open common fields, commons, marshes,\r\netc., to be divided amongst the several persons ‘according to their\r\nrespective Rights and Interests,’ due regard being paid to Quality,\r\nQuantity, and Situation, and the allotments being placed as near the\r\nHomesteads, etc., as is consistent with general convenience.\r\n\r\nAll houses erected 20 years and more before the Act, and the Sites of\r\nall such houses to be considered as ancient messuages entitled to right\r\nof common, with the exception of houses built on encroachments, the\r\nowners of which are to have whatever allotment the Commissioners think\r\nfair and reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners are to give notice of a place where a schedule\r\nof allotments can be inspected and of a meeting where objections\r\ncan be heard. The Commissioners are to hear complaints, but their\r\ndetermination is to be binding and conclusive on all parties.\r\n\r\nWhen the award is drawn up ‘the said Allotments, Partitions, Divisions,\r\nand Exchanges, and all Orders, and Directions, Penalties, Impositions,\r\nRegulations and Determinations so to be made as aforesaid, in and by\r\nsuch Award or Instrument, shall be, and are hereby declared to be\r\nfinal, binding and conclusive unto and upon all Persons interested in\r\nthe said Division and Inclosure.’ Persons who refuse to accept within\r\nan appointed time, or who molest others who accept, are ‘divested of\r\nall Right of Possession, Right of Pasturage and Common, and all other\r\nRight, Estate and Interest whatsoever in the allotments.’ Allotments\r\nare to be of the same tenure as the estates in right of which they are\r\ngiven. Copyhold allotments in the Manors of Croydon and Waddon can be\r\nenfranchised by the Commissioners at the request of the allottees, a\r\npart of such allotments being deducted and given to the Archbishop for\r\ncompensation. Allotments may be laid together if the different owners\r\nwish it.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCROACHMENTS.--Those made within 6 months not to count. Those of 20\r\nyears old and over to remain with present possessor, but not to confer\r\nright to an allotment.\r\n\r\nEncroachments under 20 years old, (1) if the encroacher has a right to\r\nan allotment, then it shall be given to him as whole or part of that\r\nallotment (not reckoning the value of buildings and improvements);\r\n(2) if the allotment to which he has a right is unequal in value to\r\nthe encroachment, or if he has no right to an allotment, he can pay\r\nthe surplus or the whole price at the rate of £10 an acre; (3) if the\r\nencroacher cannot or will not purchase, the Commissioners are to allot\r\nhim his encroachment for which he is to pay rent at the rate of 12s.\r\nan acre a year for ever, such rent being apportioned to whomever the\r\nCommissioners direct as part of their allotment.\r\n\r\nProvisions are also made for giving encroachers allotments elsewhere\r\ninstead, in certain cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENCING.--To be done by allottees. If the proportion of fencing to\r\nbe done by any allottee is unfair, the Commissioners have power to\r\nequalise it. _Exception._--(1) The allotment to Rector for Tithes which\r\nis to be fenced at the expense of or by the person or persons whom the\r\nCommissioners appoint; (2) The allotments belonging to certain estates\r\nleased out at reserved rents by the Archbishop and by Trinity Hospital\r\nfor 21 years, are to be fenced by the lessees; to compensate lessees\r\nnew leases are to be allowed; (3) Allotments to Charity Estates (except\r\nTrinity Hospital) are to have a part deducted from them and be fenced\r\nby the Commissioners. If any proprietor refuses to fence, his neighbour\r\ncan, on complaint to a J.P., obtain an order or an authorisation to\r\nenter, do the fencing, and take the rents till it is paid for.\r\n\r\nGuard fences to protect the quickset are allowed.\r\n\r\n_Penalty for damaging fences_ from 40s. to £10. The owner of the\r\ndamaged fence may give evidence. Half the penalty goes to the informer\r\nand half to the owner. But if the owner informs, the whole penalty goes\r\nto the Overseer.\r\n\r\nEstates may be mortgaged up to 40s. an acre to meet expenses of\r\nfencing. Roads are not to be depastured for 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSES.--To meet all expenses (including the lawsuits on feigned\r\nissues) part of the Commons, Wastes, etc., are to be sold by public\r\nauction. Private sales are also authorised, but no one person may buy\r\nprivately more than 2 acres; except that if James Trecothick, Esq., so\r\nwishes, the Commissioners are to sell him by private contract part of\r\nAddington Hills at what they judge a fair and reasonable price.\r\n\r\nAny surplus is to be paid to the Highways or Poor Rates within 6 months\r\nafter award. Commissioners are to keep Accounts, which must be open to\r\nInspection.\r\n\r\nCommon Rights and Interests may be sold before the execution of the\r\naward by allottees except the Archbishop, the Vicar, Trinity Hospital,\r\nand Trustees for Charitable purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION TO OCCUPIERS.--In the case of leases at rack-rent the\r\nCommissioners are to set out the allotment to the owner, but the owner\r\nis to pay fair compensation to the tenant for loss of right of common,\r\neither by lowering his rent or by paying him a gross sum of money as\r\nthe Commissioners direct. _Exception._--If the Commissioners think it a\r\nmore equitable course they may allot the allotment to the tenant during\r\nhis lease, and settle what extra rent he shall pay in respect of the\r\nowner’s expense in fencing, etc.\r\n\r\nSatisfaction for crops, ploughing, tilling, manuring, etc. is to be\r\ngiven in cases where the ground is allotted to a new possessor.\r\n\r\n\r\nROADS.--Commissioners have power to set out and shut up roads (turnpike\r\nroads excluded), footpaths, etc., but if they shut up a footpath\r\nthrough old inclosed land, the person for whose benefit it is shut is\r\nto pay such compensation as the Commissioners decide, the money going\r\ntowards the Expenses of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF APPEAL.--To Quarter Sessions only, and not in cases, _e.g._\r\nclaims and allotment, where the Commissioners’ decisions are final and\r\nconclusive or a provision for trial at law is made.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN ACT AND AWARD.--As soon as the Act is passed the\r\nCommissioners are to have sole direction of the course of husbandry.\r\nException.--They are not to interfere with Thomas Wood and Peter Wood,\r\nGentlemen, in their cultivation of such parts of the common fields of\r\nWaddon as are leased to them by the Archbishop. (Four years of the\r\nlease are still to run.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAWARD.--Date, March 2, 1801. Clerk of Peace or of County Council,\r\nSurrey.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMENDING ACT, 1803.--(Private, 43 George III. c. 53.)\r\n\r\nPassed in response to a petition (February 16, 1803) from the Vicar,\r\nChurchwardens, Overseers, and other inhabitants of Croydon, stating\r\nthat whereas the Commissioners have set out 237 acres 2 roods for the\r\ninhabitants of Croydon, instead of 215 acres, doubts have arisen as to\r\nwhether this land is vested in trustees as was directed to be done with\r\nthe 215 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES.--The 237 acres 2 roods to be treated as the 215 acres.\r\nLand up to 5 acres to be sold to defray cost of this new Act; any\r\nsurplus to go to Use and Benefit of Poor, any deficit to be made up by\r\nrents or sale of gravel.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON RESULTS.--Third Report of Select Committee on Emigration,\r\n1826-7, p. 369. Dr. Benjamin Wills stated that as the result of the\r\nloss of common rights suffered under the Bill, he had seen some 900\r\npersons summoned for the Poor Rate. ‘By the destruction of the common\r\nrights, and giving no remuneration to the poor man, a gentleman has\r\ntaken an immense tract of it and converted it into a park: a person in\r\nthe middling walk of life has bought an acre or two; and though this\r\ncommon in its original state was not so valuable as it has been made,\r\nyet the poor man should have been consulted in it; and the good that it\r\nwas originally to him was of such a nature that, destroying that, has\r\nhad an immense effect.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A (5)\r\n\r\nHAUTE HUNTRE, LINCS.--ENCLOSURE ACT, 1767\r\n\r\n\r\nAREA.--22,000 Acres ‘more or less.’\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF GROUND.--Haute Huntre, Eight Hundred or Holland Fen and other\r\ncommonable places adjacent.\r\n\r\nOwners and Proprietors of Houses and Toftsteads in the following 11\r\nParishes or Townships have Right of Common:--Boston West, Skirbeck\r\nQuarter, Wyberton, Frampton, Kirton, Algarkirke, Fosdyke, Sutterton,\r\nWigtoft, Swineshead, and Brothertoft; and also in a place called Dog\r\nDyke in the Parish of Billinghay.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.--_December 4, 1766._--Petition for enclosure\r\nfrom various owners and proprietors with right of common, asking that\r\nthe fen shall be divided up into specific allotments for each Town.\r\nLeave given. Bill read first time, December 9.\r\n\r\n_March 4, 1767._--Long petition against the bill from (1) the Master,\r\nFellows and Scholars of Trinity College, Cambridge, which College\r\nis Impropriator of the Great Tythes, and Patron of the Vicarage of\r\nSwineshead, (2) the Rev. John Shaw, Patron and Rector of Wyberton, (3)\r\nZachary Chambers, Esq., Lord of the Manor of Swineshead, and others.\r\nThe petition gave a history of the movement for enclosure. On August\r\n26, 1766, a meeting of several gentlemen and others was held at the\r\nAngel Inn, Sleaford, at which a resolution was passed that a Plan or\r\nSurvey of the fen with a return of the Houses etc., with Right of\r\nCommon should be made before a bill was brought in. On October 16,\r\n1766, a public meeting of several proprietors was held at Sleaford at\r\nwhich some of those present proposed to read a bill for dividing and\r\ninclosing the fen; the great majority however of those present objected\r\nto this course, and requested and insisted that as no Survey had been\r\nproduced, nothing further should be done till the following spring,\r\n‘but notwithstanding the said Request, some few of the said Proprietors\r\nthen present proposed that a Petition for the said Bill might then be\r\nsigned; which Proposition being rejected by a considerable Majority,\r\nthe said few Proprietors declared their Resolution to sign such a\r\nPetition, as soon as their then Meeting was broke up, without any\r\nResolutions being concluded upon, or the Sentiments of the Majority of\r\nthe Proprietors either entered down or paid any Regard to, and without\r\nmaking any Adjournment of the said Meeting; and that, soon after the\r\nsaid Meeting broke up, some of the Proprietors present at the said\r\nMeeting signed the Petition, in consequence of which the said Bill hath\r\nbeen brought in.’ The petitioners also pointed out that the petition\r\nfor enclosure was signed by very few proprietors except those in Boston\r\nWest, and requested that no further measures should be taken till next\r\nsession, and that meanwhile the Survey in question should be made, and\r\nsuggested that the present bill was in many respects exceptionable, and\r\nasked to be heard by Counsel against the bill as it now stood. Petition\r\nto lie on table till second reading.\r\n\r\n_March 6, 1767._--Bill read second time and committed.

(May 14), both of which\r\nwere referred to the Committee. Several amendments were made, including\r\nthe insertion of a clause giving the Proprietors or Occupiers the same\r\nright of common over the Parish allotment as they already had over the\r\nwhole. Royal Assent, June 29, 1767.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES OF ACT.--(Private, 7 George III. c. 112.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONERS.--Five are to be appointed; they are to be chosen by\r\neleven persons, each representing one of the eleven townships. These\r\neleven persons are to be elected in each township by the owners and\r\nproprietors of Houses, Toftsteads, and Lands which formerly paid\r\nDyke-reeve assessments; except in the case of Brothertoft, where Sir\r\nCharles Frederick, as sole owner and proprietor, nominates the person.\r\nNo person interested in the inclosure is to be chosen as Commissioner,\r\nand in addition to the usual oath of acting ‘without favour or\r\naffection’ the Commissioners are required to take the following oath:--\r\n\r\n‘I, A. B., do swear, that I am neither Proprietor nor Occupier of,\r\nnor, to the best of my Knowledge, am I concerned as Guardian, Steward\r\nor Agent for any Proprietor of any Houses, Toftsteads, or Lands within\r\nany of the Parishes of’ (names given) ‘or for any Person to whom any\r\nAllotment is to be made by virtue of the said Act.’\r\n\r\nThree Commissioners are a quorum. Vacancies are to be filled by the\r\n11 persons elected as before. If they fail to do so, the remaining\r\nCommissioners can nominate. Survey to be made by persons appointed\r\nby the Commissioners, and number of present Houses and Toftsteads to\r\nbe recorded except in Boston West and Brothertoft. Edward Draper of\r\nBoston, Gentleman, to be Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAYMENT.--Commissioners each to have £210 and no more. Two guineas to\r\nbe deducted for each day’s absence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAIMS.--Nothing is said about sending in claims, as the survey giving\r\nthe Houses, etc., does instead. If any difference or dispute arise\r\nbetween parties interested in the division with respect to shares,\r\nrights, interests, and proportions, the Commissioners are to hear them,\r\nand their determination is to be binding and conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF DIVISION--SPECIAL PROVISIONS:\r\n\r\n_To Lords of the Manor._--Zachary Chambers, Esq., is Lord of the Manor\r\nof Swineshead; Charles Anderson Pelham, Esq., is Lord of the Manor of\r\nFrampton. These two are intitled jointly to the soil of the fen, and\r\nCharles Anderson Pelham, Esq., is also intitled ‘to the Brovage or\r\nAgistment’ of 480 head of cattle on the fen every year.\r\n\r\n(1) Zachary Chambers, Esq., is to have 120 Acres in one piece in a part\r\ncalled Brand End in lieu of his rights of soil and of all mines and\r\nquarries of what nature whatsoever.\r\n\r\n(2) Charles Anderson Pelham, Esq., is to have 120 Acres in one piece,\r\nnear Great Beets, for his rights of soil and of mines and quarries.[492]\r\n\r\nCharles Anderson Pelham, Esq., is also to have in lieu of his right of\r\nBrovage a parcel of the same number of acres that were given by an Act\r\nof 9 James I. to the Lords of the Manor of Swineshead for Brovage.\r\n\r\n_Tithe Owners._--Not mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Allotment of Residue._--After part has been sold for expenses (see\r\nbelow) and after allotment to the Lords of the Manor, the residue is\r\nto be divided amongst the eleven townships and Dog Dyke in proportion\r\nand according to the number of Houses and Toftsteads in each parish.\r\nFor Brothertoft and Dog Dyke there are special arrangements; in\r\nthe ten remaining townships or parishes, the following method is\r\nto be pursued:--For each House or Tenement there must be 4 acres,\r\nand for each Toftstead 2 acres allowed; when this proportion has\r\nbeen set out, the remainder is to be shared out in proportion to\r\nthe Dyke-reeve assessments before the passing of a recent drainage\r\nAct. Quantity, Quality, and Situation are to be considered. _Special\r\nprovision._--Boston West is to have the same proportion of fen as\r\nFrampton.\r\n\r\nThe share that each of the above ten townships receives is to be the\r\ncommon fen belonging to the township or parish, subject to the same\r\ncommon rights as the present fen, and is to be contiguous to the\r\ntownship.\r\n\r\n_Brothertoft and Dog Dyke allotments._--The allotment for Brothertoft\r\nis to be half as many acres as are allotted to Boston West, and is to\r\ngo to Sir Charles Frederick, sole owner and proprietor, and to be near\r\nBrothertoft.\r\n\r\nThe Allotment to Dog Dyke is to be calculated in reference to the share\r\nthat Brothertoft receives. Each House or Toftstead in Dog Dyke is to\r\nhave 2/3 of the proportion that each House or Toftstead in Brothertoft\r\nis assigned. The Dog Dyke Allotment is to go to Earl Fitzwilliam, the\r\nsole owner, and is to be near the Earl’s gardens.\r\n\r\nIf any half-year lands, and other inclosed lands, directed to be sold\r\n(see Expenses) remain unsold, these are to be sold and the leases are\r\nto be allotted to the parishes in such proportions as the Commissioners\r\ndirect.\r\n\r\nAn award is to be drawn up and its provisions are binding and\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENCING.--Each township’s share is to be divided by an 8-feet wide\r\nditch and a quick hedge, and guarded with a fence and rail 4-1/2 feet\r\nhigh, with double bars of fir or deal and with oak posts; the fence\r\nand the rail are to be nailed or mortified together. The Commissioners\r\ndo this fencing out of the money raised for defraying the expenses of\r\nthe Act, but each township is to keep up its fences according to the\r\nCommissioners’ directions. The fences, etc., are to be made within 18\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n_Penalty_ for wilfully and maliciously cutting, breaking down, burning,\r\ndemolishing, or destroying any division fence:\r\n\r\n 1st offence (before 2 J.P.’s), fine of £5 to £20, or from 1 to 3\r\n months in House of Correction.\r\n\r\n 2nd offence (before 2 J.P.’s), fine of £10 to £40, or from 6 to 12\r\n months in House of Correction.\r\n\r\n 3rd offence (before Quarter Sessions), transportation for 7 years as a\r\n felon.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSES.--To defray all expenses the Commissioners can--\r\n\r\n(1) sell the Right of Acreage or Common upon certain specified\r\nhalf-year lands,[493] _e.g._ The Frith, Great Beets, Little Beets, the\r\nMown Rakes, etc., to the owners and proprietors of these lands. If the\r\nowners refuse to buy or do not pay enough to cover the expenses of the\r\nAct, the Commissioners can--\r\n\r\n(2) sell part of the Fen. In this case the first land to be sold is\r\nCoppin Sykes Plot, Ferry Corner Plot, Pepper Gowt Plot, and Brand End\r\nPlot; the next land, Gibbet Hills.\r\n\r\nAs Coppin Sykes Plot, etc., belong to the Commissioners of two Drainage\r\nActs, the drainage Commissioners can as compensation charge rates on\r\nthe respective townships instead, and if any township refuses to pay,\r\nthey can inclose a portion of its allotment, but not for tillage.\r\n\r\n_Penalty for taking turf or sod_ after Act.\r\n\r\nCulprit can be tried before one J.P., and fined from 40s. to £10,\r\nor, if he or she fails to pay, be given hard labour in the House of\r\nCorrection for 1 to 3 months, or till the penalty is paid. Notice of\r\nthis penalty is to be fixed on Church and Chapel Doors and published in\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF APPEAL.--To Quarter Sessions only, and not in cases where the\r\nCommissioners’ decisions are said to be final and conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nAWARD.--Date, May 19, 1769. With Clerk of Peace or County Council,\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nFrom _Annual Register_, 1769, p. 116 (Chronicle for July 16):\r\n\r\n‘Holland Fen, in Lincolnshire, being to be inclosed by act of\r\nparliament, some desperate persons have been so incensed at what they\r\ncalled their right being taken from them, that in the dead of night\r\nthey shot into the windows of several gentlemen whom they thought\r\nactive in procuring the act for inclosure; but happily no person has\r\nbeen killed.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAMENDING ACT, 1770.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.--_January 25, 1770._--Petition for an\r\namending Act from the Commissioners who carried out the previous one;\r\nstating that ‘the Posts and Rails for many Miles in the Division\r\nFences, which have been erected pursuant to the Directions of the said\r\nAct, have been pulled down, and the greatest Part thereof destroyed,\r\ntogether with great Part of the Materials for completing the said\r\nFencing,’ and asking for leave to take down the Fencing and to make\r\nwide ditches instead.\r\n\r\nLeave given. Bill passed both Houses and received Royal Assent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES OF AMENDING ACT.--(Private, 10 George III. c. 40.)\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners are empowered to take down the posts and rails, and\r\nto make ditches 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep as boundaries instead.\r\n\r\nThe Posts and Rails are to be sold, and the proceeds are to defray\r\nthe expenses of this Act and the costs of the Commissioners. The\r\nCommissioners are to have a sum of £31, 10s. each as payment, with 2\r\nguineas deducted for each day’s absence.\r\n\r\nEdward Draper, Clerk to the Commissioners, is to be repaid up to £1000,\r\nhis costs in prosecuting fence-destroyers.\r\n\r\nIf any proprietor has already made ditches wide enough, he is to be\r\nrepaid his proportion.\r\n\r\nAny surplus is to be handed over to Drainage Commissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:--\r\n\r\n                                                    Act.

Leave given, bill presented, read twice, March 19; committed\r\nMarch 28. Petition against the bill from ‘a very great Number of the\r\nFreeholders, and Customary or Copyhold Tenants having Right of Common,’\r\nstating that the bill contains provisions very injurious to the\r\npetitioners and others. Referred to the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT AND ENUMERATION OF CONSENTS.--_May 7, 1770._--Lord Strange\r\nreported from the Committee that the allegations of the bill were true,\r\nthat no person had appeared before the Committee to oppose the bill,\r\nand that ‘the Parties concerned had given their Consent’ ‘(except the\r\nProprietors of Land in the Seven Lower Constableries, assessed to\r\nthe Land Tax at £47, 2s. 3d. per Annum, and the Proprietors of Land\r\nin the Four Higher Constableries assessed to the Land Tax at £118,\r\n3s. 6-3/4d., and that the whole of the Assessment in the Seven Lower\r\nConstableries, and for Estates of several Persons adjoining, being\r\nwithin the District called the Forest, in virtue whereof Right of\r\nCommon is enjoyed, amounts to £497, 1s. 4-1/2d., and in the Four High\r\nHamlets to £183, 9s. 8d.).’\r\n\r\nThe bill passed both Houses and received the Royal Assent on May 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES OF ACT.--(Private, 10 George III. c. 94.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONERS.--Five appointed. William Hill of Tadcaster, Gentleman;\r\nJoseph Butter of Bowthorp, Surveyor; William Chippendale of Ripley,\r\nSurveyor; John Flintoff of Boroughbridge, Surveyor; Thomas Furness of\r\nOtley, Gentleman. Vacancies to be filled up by remaining Commissioners.\r\nThree are a quorum.\r\n\r\n\r\nARBITRATORS.--Nine appointed by name. Two can act. Vacancies to be\r\nfilled up by Commissioners from barristers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEYORS.--Three named, two of them are also Commissioners.

Failure to deliver in ‘such Writing and\r\nAccount as aforesaid’ at the first three meetings debars the would-be\r\nclaimant from all right to allotment, ‘Infancy, Coverture, Lunacy, or\r\nany other general legal Impediment whatsoever of or in any such Person\r\nin anywise notwithstanding.’\r\n\r\nIf claims are duly made and no objection raised to them by any\r\nperson, they are to be allowed finally and conclusively at the\r\nfourth meeting; and no right so allowed can be disputed afterwards.\r\nSupposing objections are made by any two other claimants or by any\r\nCommissioner present, then the matter is to be referred to two or more\r\nof the arbitrators whose decision is to be final and conclusive. If\r\nunreasonable, unjust, frivolous or vexatious claims or objections are\r\nmade, the Arbitrators can assess the costs on the maker.\r\n\r\nIn deciding on claims, 40 years’ enjoyment of commonage is to be\r\nconsidered to confer a right, when it is enjoyed in respect of owning\r\nancient messuages, etc., whether situated within or without the limits\r\nof the Forest (save and except in respect of Commonage by Vicinage).\r\n\r\nThe quantity and the value of the lands in virtue of which claims are\r\nmade, are to be adjudged by the Commissioners, and such judgment is to\r\nbe final and conclusive, but no ancient Messuage or Building or Scite\r\nthereof is to be allowed at greater value than any other.\r\n\r\nDisputes between landlords and tenants are to be referred to the\r\nArbitrators, and their award is to be final and conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF DIVISION--SPECIAL PROVISIONS:\r\n\r\n_Provisions for the Lord of the Manor_ (the King).--(1) One-tenth part\r\nof the whole, after allotments for Stone Quarries, watering places\r\nand roads have been deducted; ‘the said Tenth Part to consist of a\r\nproportionable Share of the best and worst kind of Land as near as may\r\nbe.’\r\n\r\n(2) All incroachments made within 40 years, and held by persons not\r\nentitled to right of common; but see Incroachments.\r\n\r\n(3) The King’s rights to Mines, Minerals, and Quarries (except Stone\r\nQuarries) are not to be prejudiced, but he or his lessee is to pay\r\nreasonable satisfaction for any damage done, such satisfaction to\r\nbe determined by 2 or more J.P.’s, or, if the parties are still\r\ndissatisfied, by a Jury of 12.\r\n\r\n_Provisions for Tithe Owners._--Such portions as the Commissioners\r\nshall adjudge to be ‘full Recompence and Satisfaction.’\r\n\r\n_For Stone Quarries, Watering Places, and Roads._--Such allotment as\r\nthe Commissioners think requisite.\r\n\r\n_For Harrogate Stray._--‘Whereas there are within the constableries\r\nof Bilton with Harrowgate and Beckwith with Rosset, or One of them,\r\ncertain Wells or Springs of medicinal Waters, commonly called\r\nHarrowgate Spaws, to which during the Summer Season great Numbers of\r\nPersons constantly resort to receive the Benefit of the said Waters\r\nto the great Advantage and Emolument of Tradesmen, Farmers, and other\r\nPersons in that Neighbourhood, and the Persons resorting to the said\r\nWaters now have the Benefit of taking the Air upon the open Part of\r\nthe said Constableries,’ it is enacted that 200 acres of land near the\r\nsaid springs shall be set apart and left free and open for ever. The\r\nFreeholders and Copyholders within the said Constableries are to have\r\nright of pasture on these 200 acres, the stint being regulated by the\r\nCommissioners, and such right of common being taken as part of their\r\nrespective allotments.\r\n\r\n_For the Poor._--None.\r\n\r\n_Allotment of Residue._--To be allotted to the Persons entitled to\r\ncommonage ‘in Proportion to the real Value of their several and\r\nrespective Messuages, Lands, and Tenements’ in respect of which they\r\nare entitled. Quality and situation to be considered in settling the\r\nQuantum. Allotments must be accepted within six months after award (see\r\nalso Fencing).\r\n\r\nAward to be drawn up with all particulars, but nothing is specifically\r\nsaid about its being final. It is to be Evidence in Courts of Law.\r\n\r\nStone Quarries are to be vested in the landholders. Allotments to\r\nbe of the same tenure as the property in virtue of which they are\r\ngiven. Timber is to belong to copyholders as if they were freeholders.\r\nDisputes arising in the execution of the Act, which do not affect the\r\npersons in general interested in the Inclosure, can, if all the Parties\r\nconcerned in the particular dispute wish it, be referred to some other\r\nArbitrator or Arbitrators not mentioned in the Act, and his or their\r\ndecision is to be final.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCROACHMENTS.--(1) Incroachments 40 years old and upwards, with all\r\nbuildings thereon, to be absolute property of persons in possession;\r\nbut Copyhold.\r\n\r\n(2) Incroachments made within 40 years.\r\n\r\n(_a_) If incroachers are also owners who have a right of common, then\r\nthe incroachments are to be given as their respective allotments\r\n(reckoning the value of the land only). If any particular incroachment\r\nis bigger than the allotment to which the incroacher is entitled, the\r\nsurplus ground is to be treated as ordinary distributable ground.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If incroachers are not entitled to right of common, then their\r\nincroachments, together with all the buildings on them, are to go\r\nto the King as Lord of the Manor; But whereas these incroachments\r\n‘consist chiefly of Buildings and Inclosures which have been erected\r\nand inclosed, or are held and enjoyed by poor Persons who have, by\r\ntheir own Industry and Labour, built and improved the same, or by\r\nPersons who have been at considerable Charges therein,’ His Majesty\r\nis graciously pleased to grant Leases for 40 years in possession, ‘to\r\nthe End no Person whatsoever may be removed from or deprived of his,\r\nher, or their present Possessions.’ These leases are to hold good even\r\nthough not amounting to one-third of the improved annual value of the\r\nincroachments. After 40 years, full rents must be taken. _Exception_ to\r\n(2 _b_).--Small incroachments made for Workhouses, for cottages of Poor\r\nchargeable to the Parish, or for Free Schools, are to be assigned to\r\nTrustees for benefit of the users.\r\n\r\nIn spite of above provisions any Incroachments which the Commissioners\r\nthink fit can be set out for roads, ditches, or fences, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENCING.--In the paragraph about selling land for expenses it says\r\nthat the Ring fences to be made by Commissioners, but elsewhere it\r\nsays fencing to be done by allottees under Commissioners’ directions.\r\n_Exception._--Tithe allotments which are to be fenced by other\r\nproprietors, and certain other cases. If allottees do not fence,\r\nCommissioners do it for them and charge. If any persons think their\r\nallotments not worth fencing, then two or more of them whose allotments\r\nare contiguous can agree to leave them unenclosed, provided that within\r\n12 months they set up a good stone wall or other substantial Fence\r\nbetween their allotments and those of others. They must keep this wall\r\nor fence in repair always.\r\n\r\nNo sheep or goats to be kept for 7 years in any Inclosure adjoining a\r\nboundary fence, unless a special wall or Pale-fence is provided.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSES.--To be defrayed by sale at auction of parcels of land.\r\nAny surplus to be distributed amongst allottees in proportion to\r\nallotments. But if a Majority in Value of the persons interested do\r\nnot wish any land sold, they can signify the same in writing, and can\r\ndeposit a sufficient sum of money for the purposes of the Act with the\r\nCommissioners, and then the provisions for sale cease. Mortgages, in\r\ncertain cases up to 50s. an acre, to meet expenses are allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nROADS.--In Award, Commissioners are to give orders for laying out\r\nroads, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION TO OCCUPIERS.--None.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF APPEAL.--To Quarter Sessions only, and not in cases where\r\ndecisions are said to be final and conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nAWARD.--June 25, 1775.

Leave given and\r\nbill brought in. March 23, 1774, Petition from Mary Denison of Leeds,\r\nwidow, and her heirs, who had ‘neglected to deliver her Claim of Common\r\nRight within the Time limited by the said Act, of which Neglect the\r\nPetitioners were not acquainted till after the Third Meeting of the\r\nCommissioners; soon after which the Petitioners caused a Claim to be\r\nmade and delivered, but the said Commissioners refused to accept the\r\nsame,’ asking for relief. Petition referred to the Committee, with\r\ninstructions that they have power to make provision in the bill.\r\n\r\n_March 25._--Petition from several persons asking relief on same\r\ngrounds as Ellen Oxley (see April 15 below).\r\n\r\nPetition from various persons asking that their allotments may be near\r\nwithin their townships.\r\n\r\n_April 14._--Petition from Daniel Lascelles, Esq., Sir Savile Slingsby,\r\nOliver Coghill, Esq., and the Rev. William Roundell stating that\r\nthey sent in claims as owners of rights of common; that these claims\r\nwere referred to the Arbitrators; and that ‘it was discovered that\r\nMistakes were made in the Description of such Tenements, or some Parts\r\ntherof; and that, notwithstanding the said Errors arose merely from\r\nInadvertency, and in no respect altered the Merits of the Petitioners’\r\nClaims, the Arbitrators did not think fit to permit the Petitioners to\r\nrectify the same,’ but disallowed the claims. The Petitioners ask for\r\nreconsideration.\r\n\r\n_April 15._--Petitions from Rev. Thomas Collins who through\r\n‘Inadvertency’ had neglected to deliver in his claim of common right in\r\nrespect of two Copyhold Messuages within the specified time, and from\r\nFrancis Bedford, ditto, _re_ copyhold close.\r\n\r\n_April 15._--Petition from Ellen Oxley and John Clarke, stating that\r\nthey preferred claims of common rights to the Commissioners; that\r\nthese claims were objected to and referred to the Arbitrators, who\r\nheard divers claims, several of which they disallowed; that as Ellen\r\nOxley and John Clarke could not produce such evidence as was required\r\nby the Arbitrators in support of their claims, they withdrew them;\r\nthat subsequently a Verdict was produced and read in evidence to the\r\nArbitrators, by means of which similar claims were allowed.\r\n\r\nBill passed both Houses. Royal Assent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES OF AMENDING ACT.--(Private, 14 George III. c. 54.)\r\n\r\nNew Commissioner added, Richard Richardson (who was one of the\r\nSurveyors under the former Act).\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSES.--Commissioners can set out allotments without abatement for\r\nsale to 48 persons named, and other allottees who give notice. In the\r\ncase of these allottees, the Commissioners are to settle their quota of\r\ncharges and assess them accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners in rendering their account may charge one guinea\r\na day for loss of time, and 10s. a day for expenses. The surveyors’\r\ncharges must be ‘reasonable and moderate.’ The Commissioners must give\r\nan account before they call for payment, and the account is to be open\r\nto inspection at the charge of 6d.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAIMS.--The claims of 32 persons named, which have been disallowed\r\nor withdrawn (1) for want of evidence; (2) for misnomers; (3) for\r\nfailure to deliver in time, are to be reconsidered. Such claims must\r\nbe delivered in at the first meeting, and must not be greater than\r\nthey were before. They can be referred on appeal to the Arbitrators as\r\nbefore, but the appellant must now give security for costs in case the\r\nappeal fails.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCROACHMENTS.--As some encroachments of over 40 years standing are\r\nfound to have no right of common (and so cannot contribute their share\r\nto the Tithe Allotment), tithes can be charged on these in the form of\r\nrent charges.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF APPEAL.--To Quarter Sessions in respect of the Commissioners’\r\naccounts, if any person interested thinks any item unreasonable, and no\r\nsatisfactory explanation is forthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\nAWARD (for 2 Acts).--June 25, 1775.

The allottees’ shares varied from as much as 1386 acres\r\n(Devisees of Sir John Ingelby, Bart.) down to a few perches.\r\n\r\nThe amount that went to trustees for the use of the poor, including the\r\nvarious small incroachments (for schools, workhouses, etc.), which were\r\nallowed to stand was about 32 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON AFTER-HISTORY.--_Annals of Agriculture_, vol. xxvii. p.\r\n292.--In 1793 Arthur Young bought an estate in Knaresborough Forest\r\nof about 4400 acres; 4000 acres of this was waste land, let out at a\r\nrental of 6d. an acre; 2751 acres of the estate were copyhold, and had\r\nbeen sold to pay the expenses of inclosure. The rest had formed part of\r\nthe King’s allotment, and was hired on a long lease. On the 400 acres\r\nof cultivated land there were 3 farmhouses. The game of the waste was\r\nlet for £30 a year; peats dug from it produced £6 to £8 a year, and\r\nArthur Young calculated that one Scotch wether could be supported per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A (7)\r\n\r\nLALEHAM.--ENCLOSURE ACT, 1774\r\n\r\n\r\nAREA.--(From Award), 918 Acres.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF GROUND.--‘Several large and open Fields,’ ‘and likewise\r\ncertain Wastes and Commons.’\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.--\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ATTEMPT, JANUARY 31, 1767.--Petition from Sir James Lowther, Lord\r\nof the Manor, and from ‘divers owners’ for enclosure of the open fields\r\nand commons, and also of ‘a large Pasture called Laleham Burway.’ Leave\r\ngiven, but bill dropped after first reading.\r\n\r\n_Second attempt, December 7, 1767._--Petition for enclosure from Sir\r\nJames Lowther alone, on behalf of himself and others.

Nothing about\r\nSurveyor’s pay.\r\n\r\nSpecial clause that certain Surveys already made may be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAIMS.--All claims about Right of Common ‘and all Differences and\r\nDisputes which shall arise between the Parties interested, or claiming\r\nto be interested in the said intended Division and Inclosure, or any of\r\nthem concerning their respective Rights, Shares, and Interests in the\r\nsaid open Fields, arable and meadow Grounds, and Lammas Lands, Commons,\r\nMoors, and Waste Grounds, or their respective Allotments, Shares and\r\nProportions which they, or any of them ought to have’ in the division,\r\nare to be heard and determined by the Commissioners. This determination\r\nis to be binding and conclusive on all parties; except with regard to\r\nmatters of Title which can be tried at law.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF DIVISION--SPECIAL PROVISIONS:\r\n\r\n(1) _Lords of the Manor_ (Sir William Gibbons, Thomas Somers Cocks,\r\nEsq., and Thomas Graham, Esq.).--One sixteenth part of the residue of\r\nthe Moors and Waste Lands, when roads and allotment for gravel have\r\nbeen deducted.\r\n\r\n(2) _Tithe Owners._--Not to be prejudiced by the Act.

But if they wish for\r\nseparate allotments they may have them.\r\n\r\nAllotments must be accepted within six months after award. Failure to\r\naccept excludes allottee from all ‘Benefit Advantage’ by this Act, and\r\nalso from all estate right or interest in any other allotment. (Saving\r\nclause for infants, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe award is to be drawn up; ‘and the Award, and all Orders,\r\nDirections, Regulations, and Determinations therein contained, and\r\nthereby declared, shall be binding and conclusive to and upon all\r\nPersons whomsoever.’ Tenure of allotments to be that of estates\r\nin virtue of which they are granted.

Also former exchanges can be confirmed\r\nby the Commissioners ‘notwithstanding any legal or natural Incapacity\r\nof any Proprietor or Owner having made any such Exchanges.’\r\n\r\n\r\nFENCING.--To be done by allottees. If any person has an undue\r\nproportion Commissioners have power to equalise.\r\n\r\n_Exceptions._--(1) Fences of cow common allotment for those who have\r\nCottage Common only (see above), which are to be made and kept in\r\nrepair by the other proprietors; but if these allottees choose to have\r\nseparate allotments they must fence them themselves.\r\n\r\n(2) Allotment for the Poor (30 acres).--To be fenced by other\r\nproprietors.\r\n\r\n(3) Allotments to charities, ditto.\r\n\r\nIf any allottee refuses to fence or keep fences in repair his neighbour\r\ncan complain to a J.P. ‘not interested’ in the inclosure, and the J.P.\r\ncan either make an order, or else empower the complainant to enter and\r\ncarry the work out at the charge of the owner.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSES.--Part of the Commons and Wastes to be sold by auction to\r\ncover expenses. Any surplus to be laid out by Commissioners on some\r\nlasting improvements; any deficit to be made up by proprietors as\r\nCommissioners direct.\r\n\r\nCommissioners are to keep accounts which must be open to inspection.\r\n\r\nTo meet expenses allotments may be mortgaged up to 40s. an acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION TO OCCUPIERS.--Leases at rack or extended rents of any of\r\nthe land to be inclosed by this Act to be void, owners paying tenants\r\nsuch compensation as Commissioners direct. Satisfaction is also to be\r\ngiven for standing crops, for ploughing, manuring, and tilling.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE ACT AND AWARD.--The Commissioners are to\r\ndirect the course of husbandry ‘as well with respect to the Stocking as\r\nto the Plowing, Tilling, Cropping, Sowing, and Laying down the same.’\r\n\r\n\r\nROADS.--Full power to set out roads and footpaths and to shut up\r\nothers. Turnpike roads excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF APPEAL.--None.\r\n\r\n\r\nAWARD.--Record Office.\r\n\r\nFrom the Award we learn as follows:--\r\n\r\n14 parcels of land, containing in all over 123 acres were sold to cover\r\nexpenses for £2512.\r\n\r\n31-1/2 acres are allotted to the Lords of the Manor (Sir William\r\nGibbons, Thomas Somers Cocks, and Thomas Graham) in lieu of their\r\nrights as Lords of the Soil.\r\n\r\n490 acres to Sir William Gibbons in trust for himself and the other\r\nLords of the Manor in lieu of all other claims (freehold lands, rights\r\nof common, etc.).\r\n\r\n69 acres to the mortgagees of the late Sir J.

The\r\nallotments to cottages vary from a quarter of an acre (John Merrick) to\r\nover an acre (Anne Higgs). The owners of cottage commons only had their\r\nallotments separately and not in common.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A (11)\r\n\r\nWAKEFIELD, YORKS.--ENCLOSURE ACT, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nAREA.--2300 acres ‘or thereabouts.’\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF GROUND.--Open Common Fields, Ings, Commons, Waste Grounds,\r\nwithin the townships of Wakefield, Stanley, Wrenthorpe, Alverthorpe,\r\nand Thornes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.--_January 23, 1793._--Petition from several\r\nowners and proprietors for enclosure.

March 28, Royal Assent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES OF ACT.--(Private, 33 George III. c. 11.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONERS.--Four appointed. (1) Richard Clark of Rothwell Haigh,\r\nGentleman; (2) John Renshaw of Owthorp, Notts, Gentleman; (3) John\r\nSharp of Gildersome, Yorks, Gentleman; (4) William Whitelock of\r\nBrotherton, Yorks, Gentleman; the first representing the Duke of Leeds,\r\nthe second the Earl of Strafford (no doubt this was the Commissioner\r\nadded in Committee), and the other two representing the Majority in\r\nValue of the Persons interested. Any vacancy to be filled up by the\r\nparty represented, and new Commissioners to be ‘not interested in the\r\nsaid Inclosure.’ Three to be a quorum. In case of dispute and equal\r\ndivision of opinion amongst the Commissioners, an Umpire is appointed\r\n(Isaac Leatham of Barton, Gentleman); the decision of Commissioners and\r\nUmpire to be final and conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAYMENT TO COMMISSIONERS.--2 guineas each for each working day. The\r\nSurveyors (2 appointed) to be paid as Commissioners think fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAIMS.--All claims with full particulars of the nature and tenure of\r\nthe property on behalf of which the claim is made are to be handed\r\nin at the 1st or 2nd meeting of the Commissioners; no claim is to be\r\nreceived later except for some special cause; and the determination of\r\nthe Commissioners as to the various claims is to be binding and final.\r\nThere are, however, three exceptions to the above, (1) Persons claiming\r\nin virtue of Messuages and Tofts need not prove usage of common; (2)\r\nAny Person who is dissatisfied with regard to his own or some one\r\nelse’s claim, may give notice in writing, and the Commissioners are\r\nthen to take Counsel’s opinion on the matter. The Commissioners are\r\nto choose the Counsel, who is to be ‘not interested in the Premises.’\r\nThe Commissioners may also on their own responsibility take Counsel’s\r\nopinion at any time they think proper; Counsel’s opinion is to be\r\nfinal. The costs are to be paid by the party against whom the dispute\r\nis determined, or otherwise as the Commissioners decide; (3) The Earl\r\nof Strafford is exempted from specifying particulars of Tenure in\r\nmaking his claim, for there are disputes on this subject between the\r\nDuke and the Earl, ‘which Matters in Difference the said Duke and Earl\r\nhave not agreed to submit to the Consideration or Determination of the\r\nsaid Commissioners.’ The Commissioners need not specify the tenure of\r\nthe Earl’s share in making their award, and if the Duke and Earl go to\r\nlaw about their dispute and the matter is settled in a Court of Equity,\r\nthen the Commissioners are to make a second special Award for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF DIVISION--SPECIAL PROVISIONS:\r\n\r\n_Provisions for the Lord of the Manor_--‘the Most Noble Francis, Duke\r\nof Leeds.’--\r\n\r\n(1) Such part of the Commons and Waste Grounds as is ‘equal in Value\r\nto One full Sixteenth Part thereof in lieu of and as a sufficient\r\nRecompence for his Right to the Soil of the said Commons and Waste\r\nGrounds, and for his Consent to the Division and Inclosure thereof;\r\n\r\n(2) An allotment of the Commons and Waste Grounds to be (in the\r\njudgment of the Commissioners) a fair compensation for his Coney\r\nWarrens which are to be destroyed;\r\n\r\n(3) An allotment equal in value (in the judgment of the Commissioners)\r\nto £40 a year as compensation for the reserved Rents he has been\r\nreceiving from persons who have made incroachments during the last 20\r\nyears;\r\n\r\n(4) An allotment or allotments of not more than 5 acres in the whole,\r\nto be awarded in such place as the Duke or his Agents appoint, close\r\nto one of his stone quarries, as compensation for the right given by\r\nthe Act to other allottees of the Common of getting stone on their\r\nallotments;\r\n\r\n(5) The value of all the timber on allotments from the common is to be\r\nassessed by the Commissioners, and paid by the respective allottees to\r\nthe Duke. If they refuse to pay, the Duke may come and cut down the\r\ntimber ‘without making any Allowance or Satisfaction whatsoever to the\r\nPerson or Persons to whom any such Allotment shall belong, for any\r\nInjury to be done thereby’;\r\n\r\n(6) The Duke’s power to work Mines and to get all Minerals is not to be\r\ninterfered with by anything in this Act but the ‘Owners or Proprietors\r\nof the Ground wherein such Pits or Soughs shall be made, driven, or\r\nworked, or such Engines, Machines or Buildings erected, or such Coals\r\nor Rubbish laid, or such Ways, Roads or Passages made and used,’ are\r\nto have a ‘reasonable Satisfaction for Damages.’ The payment of the\r\nreasonable Satisfaction however is not to fall on the Duke, but on all\r\nthe allottees of the Commons and Waste Grounds who are to meet together\r\nin the Moot Hall and appoint a salaried officer to settle the damages\r\nand collect the money by a rate raised according to the Poor Rate\r\nof the previous year. If the claimant and the officer fail to agree,\r\narbitrators, and ultimately an umpire, can be appointed.\r\n\r\n_Provisions for Tithe Owners._--A fair allotment is to be given to\r\nthe Vicar in compensation for his small Tythes. In cases where the\r\nallottees have not enough land to contribute their due share to the\r\ntithe allotment, they have to pay a yearly sum instead.\r\n\r\n_For Stone and Gravel_, _etc._--Suitable allotments for stone and\r\ngravel, etc., to be made ‘for the Use and Benefit’ of all allottees\r\n‘for the Purpose of getting Stone, Sand, Gravel, or other Materials\r\nfor making and repairing of the public Roads and Drains’; but these\r\nallotments are not to include any of the Duke’s or of his tenants’\r\nstone quarries.\r\n\r\n_Provision for the Poor._--None.\r\n\r\n_Allotment of Residue._--(1) The open fields are to be divided out\r\namongst the present proprietors in proportion to their present value\r\nand with regard to convenience; unless any owner of open-field land\r\nspecially asks for an allotment elsewhere; (2) The owners of Ings are\r\nto have Ings allotted to them, unless they wish for land elsewhere; (3)\r\nThe Commons and Waste grounds are first to have the various allotments\r\nto the Lord of the Manor and the Vicar specified above, and also the\r\nallotment for Stone and Gravel for roads deducted from them, and then\r\nthe residue is to be allotted ‘among the several Persons (considering\r\nthe said Duke of Leeds as one) having Right of Common in or upon the\r\nsaid Commons and Waste Grounds’ in the following fashion; one half is\r\nto be divided among the Owners or Proprietors of Messuages, Cottages\r\nor Tofts with Right of Common, according to their several Rights and\r\nInterests; the other half, together with the rest and residue of Land\r\nto be divided, is to be allotted among the Owners or Proprietors of\r\nopen common fields, Ings, and old inclosed Lands according to their\r\nseveral rights and interests ‘without any undue Preference whatsoever.’\r\nThe Commissioners are also directed to pay due regard to situation\r\nand to putting the different allotments of the same person together.\r\nAllotments are to be of the same tenure, _i.e._ freehold or copyhold,\r\nas the holdings in respect of which they are claimed, but no fines are\r\nto be taken on account of the allotment.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the allottees of allotments on Westgate Moor, a special\r\nclause (see petition on January 23) is inserted. They are forbidden to\r\nput up any House, Building or Erection of any kind on one part for 20,\r\non another for 40, on another for 60, years, unless the Duke consents,\r\nthe object being ‘thereby the more advantageously to enable the said\r\nDuke, his Heirs and Assigns, to work his Colliery in and upon the same\r\nMoor.’\r\n\r\nThe award, with full particulars of allotments, etc., is to be drawn\r\nup and is to be ‘final, binding, and conclusive upon all Parties and\r\nPersons interested therein.’\r\n\r\nIf any person (being Guardian, etc., tenant in tail or for life of\r\nlessee, etc.) fails to accept and fence, then Commissioners can do\r\nit for him and charge; if he still refuses, Commissioners can lease\r\nallotment out and take rent till Expenses are paid.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCROACHMENTS.--Incroachments 20 years old are to stand; those made\r\nwithin 20 years are to be treated as part of the Commons to be divided,\r\nbut they are, if the Commissioners think it fit and convenient, to be\r\nallotted to the person in possession without considering the value of\r\nerections and improvements. Three contingencies for allotment to the\r\nperson in possession are provided for;--(1) if he is entitled to an\r\nallotment, his incroachment is to be treated as part or the whole of\r\nhis allotment;\r\n\r\n(2) If his incroachment is of greater value than the allotment he\r\nis entitled to, then he is to pay whatever extra sum of money the\r\nCommissioners judge right;\r\n\r\n(3) If he is not entitled to any allotment at all, then he has to pay\r\nthe price set on his incroachment by the Commissioners.\r\n\r\nIf the Commissioners do not allot an incroachment to the person in\r\npossession, they may sell it at public auction and apply the money\r\nto the purposes of the Act, or they may allot it to someone not in\r\npossession, in which case a ‘reasonable’ sum of money is to be given to\r\nthe dispossessed owner, the new allottee paying the whole or part of it.\r\n\r\nThe above provisions apply to the ordinary incroachers; the Duke has\r\nspecial arrangements. If he has made any new incroachments during\r\nthe last 20 years in addition to any older incroachments, these new\r\nincroachments are to be valued by the Commissioners, and the Duke is\r\nto have them either as part of his allotment or for a money payment,\r\nas he chooses; also ‘whereas the Tenants of the said Duke of Leeds of\r\nthe Collieries on the said Commons and Waste Lands ... have from Time\r\nto Time erected Fire Engines, Messuages, Dwelling Houses, Cottages and\r\nother Buildings upon the said Commons and Waste Lands, and made several\r\nother Conveniences thereon for the Use and Accommodation of the said\r\nCollieries, and the Persons managing and working the same, a great Part\r\nof which have been erected and made within the last Twenty Years, these\r\nare not to be treated like other incroachments, but are to ‘be and\r\ncontinue the absolute Property of the said Duke of Leeds, his Heirs and\r\nAssigns, in as full and ample Manner’ as if the erections had been made\r\nmore than 20 years before.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENCING.--All allotments are to be fenced at the expense of their\r\nseveral proprietors ‘in such Manner, Shares and Proportions as the said\r\nCommissioners shall ... direct’ with the following exceptions--(1)\r\nthe Vicar’s allotment for small Tithes is to be fenced by the other\r\nproprietors; (2) the allotments to Hospitals, Schools, and other public\r\nCharities are to have a certain proportion deducted from them to cover\r\nthe cost of fencing. Allottees who refuse to fence can be summoned\r\nbefore a J.P. by their neighbours, and the J.P. (who is not to be\r\ninterested in the Enclosure) can make an order compelling them to fence.\r\n\r\nTo protect the new hedges, it is ordered that no sheep or lambs are to\r\nbe turned out in any allotment for 7 years, unless the allottee makes\r\nspecial provision to protect his neighbour’s young quickset, and no\r\nbeasts, cattle or horses are to be turned into any roads or lanes where\r\nthere is a new-growing fence.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSES.--Part of the Commons and Waste Grounds is to be sold to\r\ncover the expences; if the proceeds do not cover the costs the residue\r\nis to be paid by the allottees in proportion to their shares, and\r\nany surplus is to be divided among them, But Hospitals, Schools, and\r\nPublic Charities are exempted from this payment, a portion of their\r\nallotments, in fact, having been already deducted in order to pay\r\ntheir share of Expenses. The Commissioners are to keep an account of\r\nExpenses, which is to be open to inspection. The owners of Ings are to\r\npay a sum of money in return for the extinction of the right of Eatage\r\n(referred to by the Petitioners) on their land from August 12 to April\r\n5; and this money is to be applied for the purposes of the Act.\r\n\r\nIf allottees find the expenses of the Act and of fencing more than they\r\ncan meet, they are allowed (with the consent of the Commissioners)\r\nto mortgage their allotments up to 40s. an acre. If they dislike\r\nthis prospect, they are empowered by the Act, at any time before the\r\nexecution of the Award, to sell their rights to allotment in respect of\r\nany common right.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION TO OCCUPIERS.--Occupiers are to pay a higher rent in\r\nreturn for the loss of the use of common rights. The clause runs\r\nas follows:--‘That the several Persons who hold any Lands or other\r\nEstates, to which a Right of Common upon the said Commons and Waste\r\nGrounds is appurtenant or belonging, or any Part of the said Open\r\nCommon Fields or Inclosures, by virtue of any Lease, of which a longer\r\nTerm than One Year is unexpired, shall and are hereby required to\r\npay to their respective Landlords such Increase of Rent towards the\r\nExpences such Landlords will be respectively put to in Consequence of\r\nthis Act, as the said Commissioners shall judge reasonable, and shall\r\nby Writing under their Hands direct or appoint, having Regard to the\r\nDuration of such respective Leases, and to the probable Benefit which\r\nwill accrue to such respective Lessees by Reason of the said Inclosure.’\r\n\r\n\r\nROADS.--Commissioners to have full power to set out and shut up roads\r\nand footpaths (turnpike roads excepted).\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF APPEAL.--To Quarter Sessions only, and not in any cases where\r\nthe Commissioners’ decisions are final, binding, or conclusive, as\r\nthey are, _e.g._ on claims (except the Earl of Strafford’s) and on\r\nallotments.\r\n\r\n\r\nAWARD.--Not with Clerks of Peace or of County Council, or in Record\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A (12)\r\n\r\nWINFRITH NEWBURGH, DORSET.--ENCLOSURE ACT, 1768\r\n\r\n\r\nAREA.--2254 Acres or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF GROUND.--Common Fields, Meadow Grounds, Sheep Downs, Commons,\r\nCommon Heaths, and other Waste Grounds.\r\n\r\n(In Report, Common Arable Fields and Common Meadows = 1218 acres.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.--_December 1, 1767._--Petition for enclosure\r\nfrom Edward Weld, Esq., George Clavell, Esq., Benjamin Thornton, Clerk,\r\nWilliam Weston, Clerk, John Felton, Gentleman, and others.

January 25, 1768, Petition from persons\r\nbeing Freeholders, Proprietors of Estates or otherwise interested,\r\nagainst the bill stating ‘that if the said Bill should pass into a\r\nLaw the Estates of the Petitioners and others in the said Parish\r\nwill be greatly injured, and several of them must be totally ruined\r\nthereby; and that some of the Petitioners, by Threats and Menaces,\r\nwere prevailed upon to sign the Petition for the said Bill; but upon\r\nRecollection, and considering the impending Ruin they shall be subject\r\nto by the Inclosure, beg Leave now to have Liberty to retract from\r\ntheir seeming Acquiescence in the said Petition,’ and ask to be heard\r\nby Counsel against the Bill. Petition referred to the Committee.\r\n\r\n_January 29, 1768._--Mr. Bond reported from the Committee that there\r\nwas an erasure in the prayer of the said Petition and asked for\r\ninstructions. A fresh Committee of 36 members (many of whom were also\r\nmembers of the other Committee) was appointed to examine into the\r\nquestion of how the erasure was made, and whether it was previous or\r\nsubsequent to the signing. This Committee was ordered to report to the\r\nHouse, but there is no record of its report.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT AND ENUMERATION OF CONSENTS.--_February 2, 1768._--Mr. Bond\r\nreported from the Committee that the allegations were true, and that\r\nthe ‘Parties concerned’ had given their consent ‘(except Four Persons\r\nwho could not be found whose Property in the Common Meadows to be\r\ninclosed amounts to Five Acres, Three Roods, Twenty Three Perches\r\nand a half; and also except Four other Persons who, when applied to\r\nfor their Consent to the Bill, refused to sign, though they declared\r\nthey had no Objection, and whose Property in the Common Meadows to be\r\ninclosed amounts to Four Acres, One Rood, Thirty Eight Perches; and\r\nalso except Six Persons whose Property in the Common Arable Fields\r\nand Common Meadows to be inclosed mounts to One hundred and twenty\r\ntwo Acres, Thirty Three Perches, who refused to sign the Bill; and\r\nalso, except Three Persons, whose Property in the Common Arable Fields\r\nand Common Meadows, to be inclosed, amounts to One hundred and seven\r\nAcres, Twenty Three Perches, who hold under Copies of Court Roll,\r\ngranted on Condition that they would join in any Act or Deed for the\r\ndividing and inclosing the said Common Fields, and Meadows, and other\r\nCommonable Lands within the said Manor, when thereto requested by the\r\nLord of the said Manor; and that the whole Number of Acres in the said\r\nCommon Arable Fields and Common Meadows is One thousand, Two hundred\r\nand eighteen, Twenty Eight Perches and a half, and that the Rector of\r\nWinfrith Newburgh and Vicar of Campden, who are intitled to all the\r\nGreat and Small Tithes arising out of the said Common Arable Fields and\r\nCommon Meadows have consented thereto).’\r\n\r\n_February 2, 1768_ (same day).--Another Petition against the bill from\r\nFreeholders, Proprietors and Persons otherwise interested stating\r\nthat the Inclosure is ‘contrary to the general Sense of the Persons\r\ninterested therein,’ and will be ‘injurious to the Property of the\r\nPetitioners and others, the smaller Landholders within the said Parish,\r\nsome of whom must, in the Petitioners’ Judgment, be totally ruined\r\nthereby.’ Petitioners to be heard when Report considered.\r\n\r\n_February 3, 1768._--Report considered. House informed that no Counsel\r\nattended. Report read. Clause added settling the expenses to be paid\r\nby Copyholders and Lessees for Lives. Bill sent to Lords. February\r\n9, Committed. Same day, Petition against it from various persons as\r\n‘contrary to the general Sense of the Persons interested therein.’\r\nReferred to Committee. February 12, Lord Delamer reported from the\r\nCommittee without amendment.

Their Manorial Rights are not to be prejudiced by Act\r\nexcept as regards ‘the Mines, Delves, and Quarries lying within and\r\nunder such Parts, Shares, and Proportions of the said Common Fields,\r\nMeadow Grounds, Sheep Downs, Commons, Common Heaths and other Waste\r\nGrounds, as shall or may be allotted and assigned to the several other\r\nFreeholders and Owners of Lands’ within these Manors ‘or to any Person\r\nor Persons not having any Lands within the said In-Parish or Manors,\r\nor within the Precincts thereof as aforesaid, in Lieu of or as an\r\nEquivalent for such Right or Claim as aforesaid; and other than and\r\nexcept such Common of Pasture and other Common Rights as can or may be\r\nclaimed by or belonging to the Lord or Lords of the said Manors in and\r\nupon the Premises so intended to be divided and inclosed as aforesaid.’\r\n\r\n_Tithe Owners._--Tithe owners to have the same rights to Tithes over\r\nthe land about to be inclosed as they have over the lands already\r\ninclosed.\r\n\r\nIf arable land is converted to pasture on inclosure (for Dairy Cows or\r\nBlack Cattle) then allottees shall pay an annual 3s. an acre to tithe\r\nowners as compensation for corn tithes. Allotments given in virtue of\r\nestates which are Cistertian Lands, are to be deemed Cistertian Lands\r\ntoo, _i.e._ to have same exemption from tithes, but any Cistertian\r\nLands which are allotted are to be under the same obligations for\r\ntithes as the estates in virtue of which they are allotted.\r\n\r\n_Provision for the Poor._--None.\r\n\r\n_Provision for Fuel Allotment._--Commissioners are to ascertain and\r\ndetermine all Rights of Common over the land to be enclosed, and are\r\nthen to set out such part or parts ‘as shall appear to them to be\r\nsufficient, and to be conveniently situate for the preserving and\r\nraising Furze, Turf, or other Fuel, for the Use of the several Persons’\r\nwho shall appear to the Commissioners to be intitled to a Right of\r\nCommon.\r\n\r\n_Allotment of Residue._--Amongst all persons who appear to the\r\nCommissioners to be intitled to a Right of Common, or to have or be\r\nintitled to any other Property in the said Common Fields, etc., in such\r\nproportions as the Commissioners judge right ‘without giving any undue\r\nPreference,’ and with due regard to Quality, Quantity, and Situation.\r\n\r\nBut the following Rules are to be observed with regard to proportions:--\r\n\r\n(1) Common Fields and Sheep Downs are to be divided ‘by and according\r\nto the Parts and Proportions of the Arable Lands lying in the said\r\nCommon Fields, where the said Parties respectively now are, or, at the\r\nTime of such Allotments so as aforesaid to be made shall be intitled\r\nto.’\r\n\r\n(2) Meadow Grounds, Commons, Common Heaths, and other Waste Grounds\r\nto be divided ‘according to the Sum or Sums of money which the said\r\nParties and each of them now stand charged with towards the Relief of\r\nthe Poor of the said Parish’ in respect of their lands which have right\r\nof common.\r\n\r\n_Special Clause._--In case it appears to the Commissioners that any\r\npersons who have no land, nevertheless have a right of common, then\r\nthe Commissioners can allot such person such part of the land to be\r\ninclosed as they think an equivalent for such right of common. In order\r\nto prevent all Differences and Disputes, the Commissioners are to draw\r\nup an Award, and this Award shall be binding and conclusive to all and\r\nevery Person and Persons interested. Failure to accept within 6 months\r\nexcludes allottee from all benefit and advantage of this Act, and\r\nalso ‘from any Estate, Interest or Right of Common, or other Property\r\nwhatsoever’ in any other allotment. (Saving clause for infants, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nINCROACHMENTS.--Not mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENCING, etc.--To be done by allottees in such proportions as\r\nCommissioners direct. Such directions to be put in award, and to be\r\nfinal and binding. Fences to be made within 12 months, or some other\r\nconvenient space of time.\r\n\r\nIf an allottee fails to fence, his neighbour can complain to a J.P.\r\n(not interested in the inclosure), who can authorise complainant to do\r\nit, and either charge defaulter or to enter on premises and receive\r\nrents till expenses paid. _Exception._--Allotment of Copyholders and\r\nleaseholders for one or more lives are to be fenced partly by the Lord\r\nof the Manor and partly by the allottees in such proportion as the\r\nCommissioners (or 4 of them) direct.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSES.--(1) Expenses of obtaining and passing the Act to be borne by\r\nthe Lords of the Manor.\r\n\r\n(2) Expenses of carrying out the Act (survey, allotment, Commissioners’\r\ncharges, etc.) to be borne by the several allottees in proportion to\r\nthe Quantity of Land allotted to them, or otherwise as Commissioners\r\ndirect. _Exception._--Tithe owners’ share to be borne by the Lords of\r\nthe Manor.

With Dorset Clerk of Peace or of County\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A (13)\r\n\r\nQUAINTON.--ATTEMPTED ENCLOSURE, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.--_March 20, 1801._--Petition for enclosures\r\nfrom ‘several persons.’ Leave given. Earl Temple, Sir William Young,\r\nand Mr. Praed to prepare bill.\r\n\r\n_April 2._--Bill read first time.\r\n\r\n_April 13._--Petition from various proprietors of Lands, Common Rights,\r\nand other Hereditaments against the bill, stating that enclosure ‘would\r\nbe attended with an Expence to the Proprietors far exceeding any\r\nImprovement to be derived therefrom.’ Ordered to be heard on second\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n_April 15._--Bill read second time. Petitioners declined to be heard.\r\nBill committed to Mr. Praed, Earl Temple, etc.\r\n\r\n_April 21._--Petition against the bill from various proprietors stating\r\n‘that the Proprietors of the said Commonable Lands are very numerous,\r\nand the Shares or Properties belonging to most of them are so small\r\nthat the proposed Division and Inclosure would be attended with an\r\nExpence far exceeding any Improvement to be derived therefrom; and\r\nthat a great Majority in Number of the said Proprietors dissent to the\r\nsaid Bill, and the Proprietors of more than One-third, and very nearly\r\nOne-half Part in Value, of the Lands to be inclosed, also dissent\r\nthereto; and that many of the Clauses and Provisions in the said Bill\r\nare also highly injurious’ to the petitioners.\r\n\r\nReferred to the Committee. All to have voices.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT AND ENUMERATION OF CONSENTS.--_June 12._--Mr. Praed reported\r\nfrom the Committee that the Standing Orders had been complied with,\r\nthat the allegations were true, and that the Parties concerned had\r\ngiven their consent (except the owners of Estates assessed to the Land\r\nTax at £39, 12s. 6-1/4d. who refused to sign the bill, and the owners\r\nof Estates assessed at £3, 10s. 0d. who were neuter; and that the whole\r\nof the Estates ‘interested’ were assessed at £246, 8s. 6d.).\r\n\r\nSame day.--Petition against the bill from Richard Wood on behalf of\r\nhimself and other proprietors who were parties to the former petition,\r\nRichard Wood being the only one left in London, setting forth ‘that\r\nthe said Bill proposes to inclose only a Part of the said Parish of\r\nQuainton, consisting of 3 open Arable Fields, and about 280 Acres of\r\nCommonable Land, lying dispersedly in, or adjoining to the said Open\r\nFields, the rest of the said Parish being Old inclosed Lands’; that the\r\nagent for the bill had given the Committee a statement (1) of the names\r\nof the persons interested; (2) of the amount at which these persons\r\nwere assessed to the Land Tax for their property throughout the parish,\r\naccording to which statement it appeared, first, that of the 34 persons\r\ninterested, ‘not being Cottagers,’ 8 assented, 4 were neuter, and 22\r\ndissented; but that, second, as stated in terms of Land Tax Assessment,\r\n£203, 5s. 11-3/4d. assented, and £39, 12s. 6-1/4d. dissented; that\r\nthis statement was wrong inasmuch as the proprietors of old inclosed\r\nlands had in respect of old inclosures no rights over the commonable\r\nlands, and that therefore no old inclosed land could rank as property\r\n‘interested’ in the inclosure. The petitioners gave the following\r\nenumeration of Consents as the correct one; whole quantity of land in\r\nthe Open Fields, ‘in respect of which only a Right of Common could be\r\nclaimed,’ 42-1/4 yard lands:--\r\n\r\n  Land belonging to those who assented,    21-3/4 yard lands\r\n        „            „        dissented,   19-1/2    „\r\n        „            „        were neutral, 1     yard land\r\n\r\nor in terms of annual value--\r\n\r\n  Assenting,      £406 10  0\r\n  Dissenting,      370  0  0\r\n  Neutral,          37  0  0\r\n\r\nThe petitioners further stated that their Counsel had offered to call\r\nwitnesses before the Committee to prove the above facts; that the agent\r\nfor the bill had retorted that old inclosed lands had a right in the\r\nCommons, although he did not pretend that such right had ever been\r\nenjoyed, or produce any witness to show that it had ever been claimed,\r\nbut supported his claim by quoting a clause in the bill by which it\r\nwas proposed that the Rector’s Tithes for the old inclosures as well\r\nas the new should be commuted for an allotment of land; and that the\r\nCommittee refused to hear the evidence tendered by the petitioners’\r\nCounsel. This Petition was referred to the Committee to whom the bill\r\nwas recommitted, and the bill was dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A (14)\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSEQUENT HISTORY OF KING’S SEDGMOOR\r\n\r\nIn 1775, Mr. Allen, Member of Parliament for Bridgwater, tried to\r\nget an enclosure bill passed. ‘Sanguine of success, and highly\r\nimpressed with the idea of its importance, he purchased a large\r\nnumber of rights, and having obtained a signature of consents, went to\r\nParliament; but not having interest enough in the House to stem the\r\ntorrent of opposition, all his delusive prospects of profit vanished,\r\nand he found himself left in a small but respectable minority.’[502]\r\nNo further attempt was made till 1788, when a meeting to consider\r\nthe propriety of draining and dividing the moor, was held at Wells.\r\n‘At this meeting Sir Philip Hales presided; and after much abuse and\r\nopposition from the lower order of commoners, who openly threatened\r\ndestruction to those who supported such a measure, the meeting was\r\ndissolved without coming to any final determination.\r\n\r\n‘The leading idea was, however, afterwards pursued, with great\r\nassiduity, by Sir Philip, and his agent Mr. Symes of Stowey; and by\r\ntheir persevering industry, and good management,’[503] application was\r\nagain made to Parliament in 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.--_February 18, 1791._--Petition from several\r\nOwners and Proprietors for a bill to drain and divide the tract of\r\nwaste ground of about 18,000 acres called King’s Sedgmoor. Petitioners\r\npoint out that the moor is liable to be overflowed, ‘and thereby the\r\nsame is not only less serviceable and useful to the Commoners, but\r\nalso, by reason of the Vapours and Exhalations which arise from thence,\r\nthe Air of the circumjacent Country is rendered less salubrious’; also\r\nthat it would be ‘beneficial, as well to the wholesomeness of the\r\nneighbouring Country as also to the Profitableness of the Pasturage of\r\nthe said Moor’ if it were drained and divided into Parochial or other\r\nlarge allotments. The House was also informed that the expense of the\r\nundertaking was not proposed to be levied by Tolls or Duties upon the\r\nParties interested.\r\n\r\nLeave given. Mr. Philips and Sir John Trevelyan to prepare. February\r\n28. Bill committed to Mr. Philips, Mr. Templar, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT AND ENUMERATION OF CONSENTS.--_March 7._--Mr. Philips reported\r\nthat the Standing Orders had been complied with, that the allegations\r\nwere true, and that the parties concerned had consented ‘(except the\r\nOwners of 107 Rights on the said Moor, who declared themselves neuter\r\nin respect to the Bill; and also except the Owners of 84 Rights, who\r\ndeclared themselves against the Bill; and that the whole of the Rights\r\non the said Moor consist of 1740, or thereabouts; and that no Person\r\nappeared before the Committee to oppose the Bill).’\r\n\r\nThe Bill passed Commons, March 9; Lords, April 15. Royal Assent, May 13.\r\n\r\nBillingsley, after describing the attempts to enclose Sedgmoor, remarks\r\n(p. 192): ‘I have been thus particular in stating the progress of this\r\nbusiness merely to show the impropriety of calling public meetings with\r\na view of gaining signatures of consent or taking the sense of the\r\nproprietors in that way. At all publick meetings of this nature which I\r\never attended noise and clamour have silenced sound sense and argument.\r\nA party generally attends with a professed desire to oppose, and truth\r\nand propriety have a host of foes to combat. Whoever therefore has\r\nan object of this kind in view let him acquire consent by _private\r\napplication_; for I have frequently seen the good effects thereof\r\nmanifested by the irresistible influence of truth when coolly and\r\nquietly administered; and it has frequently happened that men hostile\r\nto your scheme have by dispassionate argument not only changed their\r\nsentiment but become warm partisans in that cause which at first they\r\nmeant to oppose.’\r\n\r\nThe task of Sir Philip and Mr. Symes in acquiring consents by the\r\ncool and quiet administration of truth must have been considerably\r\nlightened by the fact that Parliament anticipated the Commissioners\r\nwith extraordinary accuracy in disregarding 55% of the claims. The\r\nCommissioners, says Billingsley, investigated 4063 claims, of which\r\nonly 1798 were allowed. The Parliamentary Committee had asserted that\r\nthere were 1740 rights, ‘or thereabouts.’\r\n\r\nThe Act for draining and dividing King’s Sedgmoor is not, so far as we\r\nhave been able to discover, amongst the printed Statutes.\r\n\r\nParticulars of the expenses are given by Billingsley (p. 196), who\r\nestimates the area at 12,000 acres:--\r\n\r\n                                                            £   _s._ _d._\r\n  To act of parliament and all other incidental expenses,  1,628 15  0\r\n  Interest of money borrowed,                              3,239  4 11\r\n  Commissioners,                                           4,314  7  8\r\n  Clerk,                                                   1,215 19  0\r\n  Surveyor,                                                  908 12  6\r\n  Printers,                                                  362  6  3\r\n  Petty expenses,                                            575 11  1\r\n  Land purchased,                                          2,801  4 11\r\n  Drains, sluices, bridges and roads,                     15,418  2  8\r\n  Awards and incidentals,                                  1,160  0  8\r\n                                                          ------------\r\n                                                         £31,624  4  8\r\n                                                         -------------\r\n\r\nAbout 700 acres were sold to discharge the expenses.\r\n\r\nThe drainage and division into parochial allotments was a preliminary\r\nto enclosure of the different parochial shares, which was of course\r\nmade easier by the fact that 55% of the claims had already been\r\ndisallowed. In the years 1796, ’97, and ’98, fourteen Enclosure Acts\r\nfor the different parishes were passed.\r\n\r\n(Butleigh and Woollavington, 1796. Aller, Ashcott, Compton Dundon,\r\nHigham, Othery, Moorlinch, Somerton, Street, and Weston Zoyland, 1797.\r\nBridgwater, Chedjoy, and Midellzoy, 1798.)\r\n\r\nBillingsley estimated that the total cost of subdividing parochial\r\nallotments would be £28,000.\r\n\r\nHe also estimated that the value of the land rose from 10s. to 35s. an\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[490] Referred to below as ‘A’.\r\n\r\n[491] Referred to below as ‘B’.\r\n\r\n[492] Note that the compensation to the Lords of the Manor added\r\ntogether comes to less than one ninety-first part of the soil.\r\n\r\n[493] _I.e._ lands over which there is right of common for half the\r\nyear between Michaelmas and Lady Day or Lammas and Lady Day.\r\n\r\n[494] This referred to roads only, see Act.\r\n\r\n[495] It took twenty-nine years.\r\n\r\n[496] Sir James Lowther, afterwards Lord Lowther, who had originally\r\npetitioned for enclosure, had died in 1802. He was succeeded by his\r\ncousin, Wordsworth’s patron.\r\n\r\n[497] These allotments were fenced by the other proprietors and did not\r\nbear any of the expenses of the Act.\r\n\r\n[498] Including 8
