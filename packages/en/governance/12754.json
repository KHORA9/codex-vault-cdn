Arthur\r\n\r\nSeptember 19, 1881, to March 4, 1885\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChester A. Arthur\r\n\r\nChester Alan Arthur was born in Fairfield, Franklin County, Vt., October\r\n5, 1830. He was the eldest son of Rev. William Arthur and Malvina Stone.\r\nHis father, a Baptist minister, was born in Ireland and emigrated to\r\nthe United States. Chester prepared for college at Union Village in\r\nGreenwich and at Schenectady, N.Y., and in 1845 entered the sophomore\r\nclass of Union College. While in his sophomore year taught school for a\r\nterm at Schaghticoke, Rensselaer County, and a second term at the same\r\nplace during his last year in college. Joined the Psi Upsilon Society,\r\nand was one of six in a class of one hundred who were elected members\r\nof the Phi Beta Kappa Society, the condition of admission being high\r\nscholarship. After his graduation in 1848, at the age of 18, attended a\r\nlaw school at Ballston Spa, N.Y.; returned to Lansingburg, N.Y., where\r\nhis father then resided, and continued his legal studies. Was principal\r\nof an academy at North Pownal, Bennington County, Vt., in 1851. In\r\n1853 entered the law office of Erastus D. Culver in New York City as\r\na student; was admitted to the bar during the same year, and at once\r\nbecame a member of the firm of Culver, Parker & Arthur. Having formed\r\nfrom early associations sentiments of hostility to slavery, as a law\r\nstudent and after his admission to the bar became an earnest advocate\r\nfor the slaves. Became a Henry Clay Whig, and cast his first vote\r\nin 1852 for Winfield Scott for President. Participated in the first\r\nRepublican State convention, at Saratoga, and took an active part\r\nin the Fremont campaign of 1856. October 29, 1859, married Ellen Lewis\r\nHerndon, of Fredericksburg, Va. January 1, 1861, was appointed on\r\nGovernor Edwin D. Morgan's staff as engineer in chief, with the rank\r\nof brigadier-general. Had previously taken part in the organization\r\nof the State militia, and had been judge-advocate of the Second\r\nBrigade. When the civil war began, in April, 1861, he became acting\r\nquartermaster-general, and as such began in New York City the work of\r\npreparing and forwarding the State's quota of troops. Was called to\r\nAlbany in December for consultation concerning the defenses of New York\r\nHarbor. Summoned a board of engineers on December 24, of which he became\r\na member, and on January 18, 1862, submitted an elaborate report on the\r\ncondition of the national forts both on the seacoast and on the inland\r\nborder of the State. Was appointed inspector-general February 10, 1862,\r\nwith the rank of brigadier-general, and in May inspected the New York\r\ntroops at Fredericksburg and on the Chickahominy. In June, 1862,\r\nGovernor Morgan ordered his return from the Army of the Potomac, and he\r\nacted as secretary of the meeting of the governors of the loyal States\r\nwhich was held June 28 in New York City. At Governor Morgan's request,\r\nGeneral Arthur resumed his former work, resigned as inspector-general,\r\nand on July 10 was appointed quartermaster-general. Retired from the\r\noffice December 31, 1862, when Horatio Seymour succeeded Governor\r\nMorgan. Between 1862 and 1872 was engaged in continuous and active law\r\npractice--in partnership with Henry G. Gardner from 1862 till 1867, then\r\nfor five years alone, and on January 1, 1872, formed the firm of Arthur,\r\nPhelps & Knevals. Was for a short time counsel for the department of\r\nassessments and taxes, but resigned the place. Continued during all this\r\nperiod to take an active part in politics. Was chairman in 1868 of the\r\nCentral Grant Club of New York, and became chairman of the executive\r\ncommittee of the Republican State committee in 1879. Was appointed\r\ncollector of the port of New York by President Grant on November 20,\r\n1871; was reappointed on December 17, 1875, and confirmed by the Senate\r\non the same day without reference to a committee, a courtesy never\r\nbefore extended to an appointee who had not been a Senator; retained the\r\noffice until July 11, 1878, when he was suspended by President Hayes. On\r\nretiring from the office of collector resumed the practice of law with\r\nthe firm of Arthur, Phelps, Knevals & Ransom. Advocated in 1880 the\r\nnomination of General Grant to succeed President Hayes. Was a delegate\r\nat large to the Chicago convention, which met June 2, 1880. After the\r\nnomination of General Garfield for the Presidency a general desire arose\r\nin the convention to nominate for Vice-President some advocate of\r\nGeneral Grant and a resident of New York State. The New York delegation\r\nindicated their preference for General Arthur, and he was nominated on\r\nthe first ballot. Was elected Vice-President November 2, 1880; took the\r\noath of office March 4, 1881, and presided over the extraordinary\r\nsession of the Senate that then began, which was very exciting. That\r\nbody being equally divided, he was frequently called upon to exercise\r\nthe right of casting the controlling vote. President Garfield was shot\r\nJuly 2, 1881, and died September 19. His Cabinet announced his death to\r\nthe Vice-President, then in New York, and at their suggestion he took\r\nthe oath as President on the 20th at his residence in New York City\r\nbefore Judge John R. Brady, of the New York supreme court. On the 22d\r\nthe oath was formally administered again in the Vice-President's room\r\nin the Capitol at Washington by Chief Justice Waite. President Arthur's\r\nname was presented to the Republican Presidential convention which met\r\nat Chicago June 3, 1884. On the first ballot he received 278 votes\r\nagainst 540 for all others, 276 on the second, 274 on the third, and 207\r\non the fourth, which resulted in the nomination of James G. Blaine. In\r\nthe canvass which ensued Mr. Arthur rendered all possible assistance to\r\nthe Republican cause and candidates. Died suddenly at his residence in\r\nNew York City November 18, 1886, and was buried in Rural Cemetery at\r\nAlbany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the fourth time in the history of the Republic its Chief Magistrate\r\nhas been removed by death. All hearts are filled with grief and horror\r\nat the hideous crime which has darkened our land, and the memory of the\r\nmurdered President, his protracted sufferings, his unyielding fortitude,\r\nthe example and achievements of his life, and the pathos of his death\r\nwill forever illumine the pages of our history.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth time the officer elected by the people and ordained by\r\nthe Constitution to fill a vacancy so created is called to assume the\r\nExecutive chair. The wisdom of our fathers, foreseeing even the most\r\ndire possibilities, made sure that the Government should never be\r\nimperiled because of the uncertainty of human life. Men may die, but\r\nthe fabrics of our free institutions remain unshaken. No higher or more\r\nassuring proof could exist of the strength and permanence of popular\r\ngovernment than the fact that though the chosen of the people be struck\r\ndown his constitutional successor is peacefully installed without shock\r\nor strain except the sorrow which mourns the bereavement. All the noble\r\naspirations of my lamented predecessor which found expression in his\r\nlife, the measures devised and suggested during his brief Administration\r\nto correct abuses, to enforce economy, to advance prosperity, and to\r\npromote the general welfare, to insure domestic security and maintain\r\nfriendly and honorable relations with the nations of the earth, will be\r\ngarnered in the hearts of the people; and it will be my earnest endeavor\r\nto profit, and to see that the nation shall profit, by his example and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nProsperity blesses our country. Our fiscal policy is fixed by law,\r\nis well grounded and generally approved. No threatening issue mars\r\nour foreign intercourse, and the wisdom, integrity, and thrift of our\r\npeople may be trusted to continue undisturbed the present assured\r\ncareer of peace, tranquillity, and welfare. The gloom and anxiety which\r\nhave enshrouded the country must make repose especially welcome now.\r\nNo demand for speedy legislation has been heard; no adequate occasion\r\nis apparent for an unusual session of Congress. The Constitution defines\r\nthe functions and powers of the executive as clearly as those of either\r\nof the other two departments of the Government, and he must answer for\r\nthe just exercise of the discretion it permits and the performance of the\r\nduties it imposes. Summoned to these high duties and responsibilities\r\nand profoundly conscious of their magnitude and gravity, I assume the\r\ntrust imposed by the Constitution, relying for aid on divine guidance\r\nand the virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the American people.\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 22, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas in His inscrutable wisdom it has pleased God to remove from us\r\nthe illustrious head of the nation, James A. Garfield, late President of\r\nthe United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is fitting that the deep grief which fills all hearts should\r\nmanifest itself with one accord toward the throne of infinite grace,\r\nand that we should bow before the Almighty and seek from Him that\r\nconsolation in our affliction and that sanctification of our loss which\r\nHe is able and willing to vouchsafe:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, in obedience to sacred duty and in accordance with the\r\ndesire of the people, I, Chester A. Arthur, President of the United\r\nStates of America, do hereby appoint Monday next, the 26th day of\r\nSeptember--on which day the remains of our honored and beloved dead\r\nwill be consigned to their last resting place on earth--to be observed\r\nthroughout the United States as a day of humiliation and mourning; and\r\nI earnestly recommend all the people to assemble on that day in their\r\nrespective places of divine worship, there to render alike their tribute\r\nof sorrowful submission to the will of Almighty God and of reverence and\r\nlove for the memory and character of our late Chief Magistrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed,\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 22d day of September, A.D. 1881, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and\r\nsixth.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES G. BLAINE,\r\n    _Secretary of State._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas objects of interest to the United States require that the Senate\r\nshould be convened at an early day to receive and act upon such\r\ncommunications as may be made to it on the part of the Executive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Chester A. Arthur, President of the United States,\r\nhave considered it to be my duty to issue this my proclamation,\r\ndeclaring that an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the\r\nUnited States to convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol,\r\nin the city of Washington, on Monday, the 10th day of October next, at\r\n12 o'clock noon on that day, of which all who shall at that time be\r\nentitled to act as members of that body are hereby required to take\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthe 23d day of September, A.D. 1881, and of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States the one hundred and sixth.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES G. BLAINE,\r\n    _Secretary of State._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _October 26, 1881_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate a communication from the Secretary of\r\nState, submitting the text, in the English and French languages, of the\r\nproceedings of the International Sanitary Conference, provided for by\r\nthe joint resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America, held at Washington in the early part of 1881.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of State in answer to\r\nthe resolution of the Senate of October 14, with accompanying\r\ndocument.[1]\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 24, 1881.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: letter of instruction to United States ministers in Europe\r\nrelative to protecting the rights and interests of the United States in\r\nthe projected interoceanic canal at Panama.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _October 26, 1881_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and His Majesty the\r\nKing of Roumania, defining the rights, immunities, and privileges of\r\nconsular officers, signed on the 17th day of June, 1881.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been the pious custom of our people, with the closing of the\r\nyear, to look back upon the blessings brought to them in the changing\r\ncourse of the seasons and to return solemn thanks to the all-giving\r\nsource from whom they flow. And although at this period, when the\r\nfalling leaf admonishes us that the time of our sacred duty is at hand,\r\nour nation still lies in the shadow of a great bereavement, and the\r\nmourning which has filled our hearts still finds its sorrowful\r\nexpression toward the God before whom we but lately bowed in grief and\r\nsupplication, yet the countless benefits which have showered upon us\r\nduring the past twelvemonth call for our fervent gratitude and make it\r\nfitting that we should rejoice with thankfulness that the Lord in His\r\ninfinite mercy has most signally favored our country and our people.\r\nPeace without and prosperity within have been vouchsafed to us, no\r\npestilence has visited our shores, the abundant privileges of freedom\r\nwhich our fathers left us in their wisdom are still our increasing\r\nheritage; and if in parts of our vast domain sore affliction has visited\r\nour brethren in their forest homes, yet even this calamity has been\r\ntempered and in a manner sanctified by the generous compassion for the\r\nsufferers which has been called forth throughout our land. For all these\r\nthings it is meet that the voice of the nation should go up to God in\r\ndevout homage.\r\n\r\nWherefore I, Chester A. Arthur, President of the United States, do\r\nrecommend that all the people observe Thursday, the 24th day of November\r\ninstant, as a day of national thanksgiving and prayer, by ceasing, so\r\nfar as may be, from their secular labors and meeting in their several\r\nplaces of worship, there to join in ascribing honor and praise to\r\nAlmighty God, whose goodness has been so manifest in our history and in\r\nour lives, and offering earnest prayers that His bounties may continue\r\nto us and to our children.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 4th day of November, A.D. 1881, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the one hundred and sixth.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES G. BLAINE,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Read by the Secretary of State before the people assembled\r\nto celebrate the Yorktown Centennial.]\r\n\r\nYORKTOWN, VA., _October 19, 1881_.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the friendly relations so long and so happily\r\nsubsisting between Great Britain and the United States, in the trust and\r\nconfidence of peace and good will between the two countries for all the\r\ncenturies to come, and especially as a mark of the profound respect\r\nentertained by the American people for the illustrious sovereign and\r\ngracious lady who sits upon the British throne\r\n\r\n_It is hereby ordered_, That at the close of the ceremonies\r\ncommemorative of the valor and success of our forefathers in their\r\npatriotic struggle for independence the British flag shall be saluted by\r\nthe forces of the Army and Navy of the United States now at Yorktown.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy will give orders\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES G. BLAINE,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1881_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAn appalling calamity has befallen the American people since their\r\nchosen representatives last met in the halls where you are now\r\nassembled. We might else recall with unalloyed content the rare\r\nprosperity with which throughout the year the nation has been blessed.\r\nIts harvests have been plenteous; its varied industries have thriven;\r\nthe health of its people has been preserved; it has maintained with\r\nforeign governments the undisturbed relations of amity and peace. For\r\nthese manifestations of His favor we owe to Him who holds our destiny\r\nin His hands the tribute of our grateful devotion.\r\n\r\nTo that mysterious exercise of His will which has taken from us the\r\nloved and illustrious citizen who was but lately the head of the nation\r\nwe bow in sorrow and submission.\r\n\r\nThe memory of his exalted character, of his noble achievements, and of\r\nhis patriotic life will be treasured forever as a sacred possession of\r\nthe whole people.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of his death drew from foreign governments and peoples\r\ntributes of sympathy and sorrow which history will record as signal\r\ntokens of the kinship of nations and the federation of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of good will between our own Government and that of Great\r\nBritain was never more marked than at present. In recognition of this\r\npleasing fact I directed, on the occasion of the late centennial\r\ncelebration at Yorktown, that a salute be given to the British flag.\r\n\r\nSave for the correspondence to which I shall refer hereafter in relation\r\nto the proposed canal across the Isthmus of Panama, little has occurred\r\nworthy of mention in the diplomatic relations of the two countries.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year the Fortune Bay claims were satisfactorily settled by\r\nthe British Government paying in full the sum of £15,000, most of which\r\nhas been already distributed. As the terms of the settlement included\r\ncompensation for injuries suffered by our fishermen at Aspee Bay, there\r\nhas been retained from the gross award a sum which is deemed adequate\r\nfor those claims.\r\n\r\nThe participation of Americans in the exhibitions at Melbourne and\r\nSydney will be approvingly mentioned in the reports of the two\r\nexhibitions, soon to be presented to Congress. They will disclose the\r\nreadiness of our countrymen to make successful competition in distant\r\nfields of enterprise.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for an international copyright convention are in hopeful\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Sitting Bull and his forces upon the Canadian frontier\r\nhas allayed apprehension, although bodies of British Indians still cross\r\nthe border in quest of sustenance. Upon this subject a correspondence\r\nhas been opened which promises an adequate understanding. Our troops\r\nhave orders to avoid meanwhile all collisions with alien Indians.\r\n\r\nThe presence at the Yorktown celebration of representatives of the\r\nFrench Republic and descendants of Lafayette and of his gallant\r\ncompatriots who were our allies in the Revolution has served to\r\nstrengthen the spirit of good will which has always existed between\r\nthe two nations.\r\n\r\nYou will be furnished with the proceedings of the Bimetallic Conference\r\nheld during the summer at the city of Paris. No accord was reached, but\r\na valuable interchange of views was had, and the conference will next\r\nyear be renewed.\r\n\r\nAt the Electrical Exhibition and Congress, also held at Paris, this\r\ncountry was creditably represented by eminent specialists, who, in the\r\nabsence of an appropriation, generously lent their efficient aid at the\r\ninstance of the State Department. While our exhibitors in this almost\r\ndistinctively American field of achievement have won several valuable\r\nawards, I recommend that Congress provide for the repayment of the\r\npersonal expenses incurred in the public interest by the honorary\r\ncommissioners and delegates.\r\n\r\nNo new questions respecting the status of our naturalized citizens\r\nin Germany have arisen during the year, and the causes of complaint,\r\nespecially in Alsace and Lorraine, have practically ceased through\r\nthe liberal action of the Imperial Government in accepting our\r\noften-expressed views on the subject. The application of the treaty of\r\n1868 to the lately acquired Rhenish provinces has received very earnest\r\nattention, and a definite and lasting agreement on this point is\r\nconfidently expected. The participation of the descendants of Baron von\r\nSteuben in the Yorktown festivities, and their subsequent reception by\r\ntheir American kinsmen, strikingly evinced the ties of good will which\r\nunite the German people and our own.\r\n\r\nOur intercourse with Spain has been friendly. An agreement concluded in\r\nFebruary last fixes a term for the labors of the Spanish and American\r\nClaims Commission. The Spanish Government has been requested to pay the\r\nlate awards of that Commission, and will, it is believed, accede to the\r\nrequest as promptly and courteously as on former occasions.\r\n\r\nBy recent legislation onerous fines have been imposed upon American\r\nshipping in Spanish and colonial ports for slight irregularities in\r\nmanifests. One case of hardship is specially worthy of attention. The\r\nbark _Masonic_, bound for Japan, entered Manila in distress, and is\r\nthere sought to be confiscated under Spanish revenue laws for an alleged\r\nshortage in her transshipped cargo. Though efforts for her relief have\r\nthus far proved unavailing, it is expected that the whole matter will be\r\nadjusted in a friendly spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Senate resolutions of condolence on the assassination of the Czar\r\nAlexander II were appropriately communicated to the Russian Government,\r\nwhich in turn has expressed its sympathy in our late national\r\nbereavement. It is desirable that our cordial relations with Russia\r\nshould be strengthened by proper engagements assuring to peaceable\r\nAmericans who visit the Empire the consideration which is due to them as\r\ncitizens of a friendly state. This is especially needful with respect to\r\nAmerican Israelites, whose classification with the native Hebrews has\r\nevoked energetic remonstrances from this Government.\r\n\r\nA supplementary consular agreement with Italy has been sanctioned and\r\nproclaimed, which puts at rest conflicts of jurisdiction in the case of\r\ncrimes on shipboard.\r\n\r\nSeveral important international conferences have been held in Italy\r\nduring the year. At the Geographical Congress of Venice, the Beneficence\r\nCongress of Milan, and the Hygienic Congress of Turin this country was\r\nrepresented by delegates from branches of the public service or by\r\nprivate citizens duly accredited in an honorary capacity. It is hoped\r\nthat Congress will give such prominence to the results of their\r\nparticipation as they may seem to deserve.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of all discriminating duties against such colonial\r\nproductions of the Dutch East Indies as are imported hither from Holland\r\nhas been already considered by Congress. I trust that at the present\r\nsession the matter may be favorably concluded.\r\n\r\nThe insecurity of life and property in many parts of Turkey has given\r\nrise to correspondence with the Porte looking particularly to the better\r\nprotection of American missionaries in the Empire. The condemned\r\nmurderer of the eminent missionary Dr. Justin W. Parsons has not yet\r\nbeen executed, although this Government has repeatedly demanded that\r\nexemplary justice be done.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Government has again solicited the good offices of our\r\ndiplomatic and consular agents for the protection of its citizens in\r\ncountries where it is not itself represented. This request has, within\r\nproper limits, been granted.\r\n\r\nOur agents in Switzerland have been instructed to protest against the\r\nconduct of the authorities of certain communes in permitting the\r\nemigration to this country of criminals and other objectionable persons.\r\nSeveral such persons, through the cooperation of the commissioners of\r\nemigration at New York, have been sent back by the steamers which\r\nbrought them. A continuance of this course may prove a more effectual\r\nremedy than diplomatic remonstrance.\r\n\r\nTreaties of commerce and navigation and for the regulation of consular\r\nprivileges have been concluded with Roumania and Servia since their\r\nadmission into the family of European States.\r\n\r\nAs is natural with contiguous states having like institutions and\r\nlike aims of advancement and development, the friendship of the United\r\nStates and Mexico has been constantly maintained. This Government has\r\nlost no occasion of encouraging the Mexican Government to a beneficial\r\nrealization of the mutual advantages which will result from more\r\nintimate commercial intercourse and from the opening of the rich\r\ninterior of Mexico to railway enterprise. I deem it important that means\r\nbe provided to restrain the lawlessness unfortunately so common on the\r\nfrontier and to suppress the forays of the reservation Indians on either\r\nside of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThe neighboring States of Central America have preserved internal peace,\r\nand their outward relations toward us have been those of intimate\r\nfriendship. There are encouraging signs of their growing disposition to\r\nsubordinate their local interests to those which are common to them by\r\nreason of their geographical relations.\r\n\r\nThe boundary dispute between Guatemala and Mexico has afforded this\r\nGovernment an opportunity to exercise its good offices for preventing a\r\nrupture between those States and for procuring a peaceable solution of\r\nthe question. I cherish strong hope that in view of our relations of\r\namity with both countries our friendly counsels may prevail.\r\n\r\nA special envoy of Guatemala has brought to me the condolences of his\r\nGovernment and people on the death of President Garfield.\r\n\r\nThe Costa Rican Government lately framed an engagement with Colombia for\r\nsettling boy arbitration the boundary question between those countries,\r\nproviding that the post of arbitrator should be offered successively to\r\nthe King of the Belgians, the King of Spain, and the President of the\r\nArgentine Confederation. The King of the Belgians has declined to act,\r\nbut I am not as yet advised of the action of the King of Spain. As we\r\nhave certain interests in the disputed territory which are protected by\r\nour treaty engagements with one of the parties, it is important that the\r\narbitration should not without our consent affect our rights, and this\r\nGovernment has accordingly thought proper to make its views known to the\r\nparties to the agreement, as well as to intimate them to the Belgian and\r\nSpanish Governments.\r\n\r\nThe questions growing out of the proposed interoceanic waterway across\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama are of grave national importance. This Government\r\nhas not been unmindful of the solemn obligations imposed upon it by its\r\ncompact of 1846 with Colombia, as the independent and sovereign mistress\r\nof the territory crossed by the canal, and has sought to render them\r\neffective by fresh engagements with the Colombian Republic looking to\r\ntheir practical execution. The negotiations to this end, after they had\r\nreached what appeared to be a mutually satisfactory solution here, were\r\nmet in Colombia by a disavowal of the powers which its envoy had assumed\r\nand by a proposal for renewed negotiation on a modified basis.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile this Government learned that Colombia had proposed to the\r\nEuropean powers to join in a guaranty of the neutrality of the proposed\r\nPanama canal--a guaranty which would be in direct contravention of our\r\nobligation as the sole guarantor of the integrity of Colombian territory\r\nand of the neutrality of the canal itself. My lamented predecessor felt\r\nit his duty to place before the European powers the reasons which make\r\nthe prior guaranty of the United States indispensable, and for which the\r\ninterjection of any foreign guaranty might be regarded as a superfluous\r\nand unfriendly act.\r\n\r\nForeseeing the probable reliance of the British Government on the\r\nprovisions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of 1850 as affording room for a\r\nshare in the guaranties which the United States covenanted with Colombia\r\nfour years before, I have not hesitated to supplement the action of my\r\npredecessor by proposing to Her Majesty's Government the modification of\r\nthat instrument and the abrogation of such clauses thereof as do not\r\ncomport with the obligations of the United States toward Colombia or\r\nwith the vital needs of the two friendly parties to the compact.\r\n\r\nThis Government sees with great concern the continuance of the hostile\r\nrelations between Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. An early peace between these\r\nRepublics is much to be desired, not only that they may themselves be\r\nspared further misery and bloodshed, but because their continued\r\nantagonism threatens consequences which are, in my judgment, dangerous\r\nto the interests of republican government on this continent and\r\ncalculated to destroy the best elements of our free and peaceful\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nAs in the present excited condition of popular feeling in these\r\ncountries there has been serious misapprehension of the position of the\r\nUnited States, and as separate diplomatic intercourse with each through\r\nindependent ministers is sometimes subject, owing to the want of prompt\r\nreciprocal communication, to temporary misunderstanding, I have deemed\r\nit judicious at the present time to send a special envoy accredited to\r\nall and each of them, and furnished with general instructions which\r\nwill, I trust, enable him to bring these powers into friendly relations.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Venezuela maintains its attitude of warm friendship\r\nand continues with great regularity its payment of the monthly quota of\r\nthe diplomatic debt. Without suggesting the direction in which Congress\r\nshould act, I ask its attention to the pending questions affecting the\r\ndistribution of the sums thus far received.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Venezuela and France growing out of the same\r\ndebt have been for some time past in an unsatisfactory state, and\r\nthis Government, as the neighbor and one of the largest creditors of\r\nVenezuela, has interposed its influence with the French Government with\r\nthe view of producing a friendly and honorable adjustment.\r\n\r\nI regret that the commercial interests between the United States and\r\nBrazil, from which great advantages were hoped a year ago, have suffered\r\nfrom the withdrawal of the American lines of communication between the\r\nBrazilian ports and our own.\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of our minister resident at Buenos Ayres and the\r\nUnited States minister at Santiago, a treaty has been concluded between\r\nthe Argentine Republic and Chile, disposing of the long-pending\r\nPatagonian boundary question. It is a matter of congratulation that our\r\nGovernment has been afforded the opportunity of successfully exerting\r\nits good influence for the prevention of disagreements between these\r\nRepublics of the American continent.\r\n\r\nI am glad to inform you that the treaties lately negotiated with China\r\nhave been duly ratified on both sides and the exchange made at Peking.\r\nLegislation is necessary to carry their provisions into effect. The\r\nprompt and friendly spirit with which the Chinese Government, at the\r\nrequest of the United States, conceded the modification of existing\r\ntreaties should secure careful regard for the interests and\r\nsusceptibilities of that Government in the enactment of any laws\r\nrelating to Chinese immigration.\r\n\r\nThose clauses of the treaties which forbid the participation of citizens\r\nor vessels of the United States in the opium trade will doubtless\r\nreceive your approval. They will attest the sincere interest which our\r\npeople and Government feel in the commendable efforts of the Chinese\r\nGovernment to put a stop to this demoralizing and destructive traffic.\r\n\r\nIn relation both to China and Japan some changes are desirable in our\r\npresent system of consular jurisdiction. I hope at some future time to\r\nlay before you a scheme for its improvement in the entire East.\r\n\r\nThe intimacy between our own country and Japan, the most advanced of the\r\nEastern nations, continues to be cordial. I am advised that the Emperor\r\ncontemplates the establishment of full constitutional government, and\r\nthat he has already summoned a parliamentary congress for the purpose\r\nof effecting the change. Such a remarkable step toward complete\r\nassimilation with the Western system can not fail to bring Japan into\r\ncloser and more beneficial relationship with ourselves as the chief\r\nPacific power.\r\n\r\nA question has arisen in relation to the exercise in that country of\r\nthe judicial functions conferred upon our ministers and consuls. The\r\nindictment, trial, and conviction in the consular court at Yokohama of\r\nJohn Ross, a merchant seaman on board an American vessel, have made it\r\nnecessary for the Government to institute a careful examination into\r\nthe nature and methods of this jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Ross was regularly shipped under the flag of the United\r\nStates, but was by birth a British subject. My predecessor felt it his\r\nduty to maintain the position that during his service as a regularly\r\nshipped seaman on board an American merchant vessel Ross was subject to\r\nthe laws of that service and to the jurisdiction of the United States\r\nconsular authorities.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation which has been heretofore urged by the\r\nExecutive upon the attention of Congress, that after the deduction of\r\nsuch amount as may be found due to American citizens the balance of the\r\nindemnity funds heretofore obtained from China and Japan, and which are\r\nnow in the hands of the State Department, be returned to the Governments\r\nof those countries.\r\n\r\nThe King of Hawaii, in the course of his homeward return after a journey\r\naround the world, has lately visited this country. While our relations\r\nwith that Kingdom are friendly, this Government has viewed with concern\r\nthe efforts to seek replenishment of the diminishing population of the\r\nislands from outward sources, to a degree which may impair the native\r\nsovereignty and independence, in which the United States was among the\r\nfirst to testify a lively interest.\r\n\r\nRelations of unimpaired amity have been maintained throughout the year\r\nwith the respective Governments of Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark,\r\nHayti, Paraguay and Uruguay, Portugal, and Sweden and Norway. This may\r\nalso be said of Greece and Ecuador, although our relations with those\r\nStates have for some years been severed by the withdrawal of\r\nappropriations for diplomatic representatives at Athens and Quito. It\r\nseems expedient to restore those missions, even on a reduced scale, and\r\nI decidedly recommend such a course with respect to Ecuador, which is\r\nlikely within the near future to play an important part among the\r\nnations of the Southern Pacific.\r\n\r\nAt its last extra session the Senate called for the text of the Geneva\r\nconvention for the relief of the wounded in war. I trust that this\r\naction foreshadows such interest in the subject as will result in the\r\nadhesion of the United States to that humane and commendable engagement.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the propriety of adopting the new code of\r\ninternational rules for the prevention of collisions on the high seas\r\nand of conforming the domestic legislation of the United States thereto,\r\nso that no confusion may arise from the application of conflicting rules\r\nin the case of vessels of different nationalities meeting in tidal\r\nwaters. These international rules differ but slightly from our own. They\r\nhave been adopted by the Navy Department for the governance of the war\r\nships of the United States on the high seas and in foreign waters, and,\r\nthrough the action of the State Department in disseminating the rules\r\nand in acquainting shipmasters with the option of conforming to them\r\nwithout the jurisdictional waters of the United States, they are now\r\nvery generally known and obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe State Department still continues to publish to the country the trade\r\nand manufacturing reports received from its officers abroad. The success\r\nof this course warrants its continuance and such appropriation as may be\r\nrequired to meet the rapidly increasing demand for these publications.\r\nWith special reference to the Atlanta Cotton Exposition, the October\r\nnumber of the reports was devoted to a valuable collection of papers on\r\nthe cotton-goods trade of the world.\r\n\r\nThe International Sanitary Conference for which, in 1879, Congress made\r\nprovision assembled in this city early in January last, and its sessions\r\nwere prolonged until March. Although it reached no specific conclusions\r\naffecting the future action of the participant powers, the interchange\r\nof views proved to be most valuable. The full protocols of the sessions\r\nhave been already presented to the Senate.\r\n\r\nAs pertinent to this general subject, I call your attention to the\r\noperations of the National Board of Health. Established by act of\r\nCongress approved March 3, 1879, its sphere of duty was enlarged by the\r\nact of June 2 in the same year. By the last-named act the board was\r\nrequired to institute such measures as might be deemed necessary for\r\npreventing the introduction of contagious or infectious diseases from\r\nforeign countries into the United States or from one State into another.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the rules and regulations prepared by the board and\r\napproved by my predecessor has done much to arrest the progress of\r\nepidemic disease, and has thus rendered substantial service to the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe International Sanitary Conference, to which I have referred, adopted\r\na form of a bill of health to be used by all vessels seeking to enter\r\nthe ports of the countries whose representatives participated in its\r\ndeliberations. This form has since been prescribed by the National Board\r\nof Health and incorporated with its rules and regulations, which have\r\nbeen approved by me in pursuance of law.\r\n\r\nThe health of the people is of supreme importance. All measures looking\r\nto their protection against the spread of contagious diseases and to the\r\nincrease of our sanitary knowledge for such purposes deserve attention\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury presents in detail a highly\r\nsatisfactory exhibit of the state of the finances and the condition of\r\nthe various branches of the public service administered by that\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ending June\r\n30, 1881, were:\r\n\r\n  From customs                                            $198,159,676.02\r\n  From internal revenue                                    135,264,385.51\r\n  From sales of public lands                                 2,201,863.17\r\n  From tax on circulation and deposits of national banks     8,116,115.72\r\n  From repayment of interest by Pacific Railway companies      810,833.80\r\n  From sinking fund for Pacific Railway companies              805,180.54\r\n  From customs fees, fines, penalties, etc.                  1,225,514.86\r\n  From fees--consular, letters patent, and lands             2,244,983.98\r\n  From proceeds of sales of Government property                262,174.00\r\n  From profits on coinage                                    3,468,485.61\r\n  From revenues of the District of Columbia                  2,016,199.23\r\n  From miscellaneous sources                                 6,206,880.13\r\n                                                           ______________\r\n  Total ordinary receipts                                  360,782,292.57\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary expenditures for the same period were:\r\n\r\n\r\n  For civil expenses                                       $17,941,177.19\r\n  For foreign intercourse                                    1,093,954.92\r\n  For Indians                                                6,514,161.09\r\n  For pensions                                              50,059,279.62\r\n  For the military establishment, including river\r\n    and harbor improvements and arsenals                    40,466,460.55\r\n  For the naval establishment, including vessels,\r\n    machinery, and improvements at navy-yards               15,686,671.66\r\n  For miscellaneous expenditures, including public\r\n    buildings, light-houses, and collecting the revenue     41,837,280.57\r\n  For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia    3,543,912.03\r\n  For interest on the public debt                           82,508,741.18\r\n  For premium on bonds purchased                             1,061,248.78\r\n                                                           ______________\r\n  Total ordinary expenditures                              260,712,887.59\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving a surplus revenue of $100,069,404.98, which was applied as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  To the redemption of--\r\n\r\n  Bonds for the sinking fund                               $74,371,200.00\r\n  Fractional currency for the sinking fund                     109,001.05\r\n  Loan of February, 1861                                     7,418,000.00\r\n  Ten-forties of 1864                                        2,016,150.00\r\n  Five-twenties of 1862                                         18,300.00\r\n  Five-twenties of 1864                                          3,400.00\r\n  Five-twenties of 1865                                         37,300.00\r\n  Consols of 1865                                              143,150.00\r\n  Consols of 1867                                              959,150.00\r\n  Consols of 1868                                              337,400.00\r\n  Texan indemnity stock                                          1,000.00\r\n  Old demand, compound-interest, and other notes                18,330.00\r\n  And to the increase of cash in the Treasury               14,637,023.93\r\n                                                           ______________\r\n                                                           100,069,404.98\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the sinking fund for the year amounted to\r\n$90,786,064.02, which sum included a balance of $49,817,128.78, not\r\nprovided for during the previous fiscal year. The sum of $74,480,201.05\r\nwas applied to this fund, which left a deficit of $16,305,873.47. The\r\nincrease of the revenues for 1881 over those of the previous year was\r\n$29,352,901.10. It is estimated that the receipts during the present\r\nfiscal year will reach $400,000,000 and the expenditures $270,000,000,\r\nleaving a surplus of $130,000,000 applicable to the sinking fund and the\r\nredemption of the public debt.\r\n\r\nI approve the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury that\r\nprovision be made for the early retirement of silver certificates and\r\nthat the act requiring their issue be repealed. They were issued in\r\npursuance of the policy of the Government to maintain silver at or near\r\nthe gold standard, and were accordingly made receivable for all customs,\r\ntaxes, and public dues. About sixty-six millions of them are now\r\noutstanding. They form an unnecessary addition to the paper currency,\r\na sufficient amount of which may be readily supplied by the national\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the act of February 28, 1878, the Treasury Department\r\nhas monthly caused at least two millions in value of silver bullion to\r\nbe coined into standard silver dollars. One hundred and two millions of\r\nthese dollars have been already coined, while only about thirty-four\r\nmillions are in circulation.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons which he specifies, I concur in the Secretary's\r\nrecommendation that the provision for coinage of a fixed amount each\r\nmonth be repealed, and that hereafter only so much be coined as shall be\r\nnecessary to supply the demand.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary advises that the issue of gold certificates should not\r\nfor the present be resumed, and suggests that the national banks may\r\nproperly be forbidden by law to retire their currency except upon\r\nreasonable notice of their intention so to do. Such legislation would\r\nseem to be justified by the recent action of certain banks on the\r\noccasion referred to in the Secretary's report.\r\n\r\nOf the fifteen millions of fractional currency still outstanding, only\r\nabout eighty thousand has been redeemed the past year. The suggestion\r\nthat this amount may properly be dropped from future statements of the\r\npublic debt seems worthy of approval.\r\n\r\nSo also does the suggestion of the Secretary as to the advisability of\r\nrelieving the calendar of the United States courts in the southern\r\ndistrict of New York by the transfer to another tribunal of the numerous\r\nsuits there pending against collectors.\r\n\r\nThe revenue from customs for the past fiscal year was $198,159,676.02,\r\nan increase of $11,637,611.42 over that of the year preceding. One\r\nhundred and thirty-eight million ninety-eight thousand five hundred and\r\nsixty-two dollars and thirty-nine cents of this amount was collected at\r\nthe port of New York, leaving $50,251,113.63 as the amount collected\r\nat all the other ports of the country. Of this sum $47,977,137.63 was\r\ncollected on sugar, melado, and molasses; $27,285,624.78 on wool and its\r\nmanufactures; $21,462,534.34 on iron and steel and manufactures thereof;\r\n$19,038,665.81 on manufactures of silk; $10,825,115.21 on manufactures\r\nof cotton, and $6,469,643.04 on wines and spirits, making a total\r\nrevenue from these sources of $133,058,720.81.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of collection for the past year were $6,419,345.20, an\r\nincrease over the preceding year of $387,410.04. Notwithstanding the\r\nincrease in the revenue from customs over the preceding year, the gross\r\nvalue of the imports, including free goods, decreased over $25,000,000.\r\nThe most marked decrease was in the value of unmanufactured wool,\r\n$14,023,682, and in that of scrap and pig iron, $12,810,671. The value\r\nof imported sugar, on the other hand, showed an increase of $7,457,474;\r\nof steel rails, $4,345,521; of barley, $2,154,204, and of steel in bars,\r\ningots, etc., $1,620,046.\r\n\r\nContrasted with the imports during the last fiscal year, the exports\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Domestic merchandise                               $883,925,947\r\n  Foreign merchandise                                  18,451,399\r\n                                                    _____________\r\n       Total                                          902,377,346\r\n\r\n  Imports of merchandise                              642,664,628\r\n                                                    _____________\r\n  Excess of exports over imports of merchandise       259,712,718\r\n\r\n  Aggregate of exports and imports                  1,545,041,974\r\n\r\n\r\nCompared with the previous year, there was an increase of $66,738,688\r\nin the value of exports of merchandise and a decrease of $25,290,118\r\nin the value of imports. The annual average of the excess of imports\r\nof merchandise over exports thereof for ten years previous to June\r\n30, 1873, was $104,706,922, but for the last six years there has\r\nbeen an excess of exports over imports of merchandise amounting to\r\n$1,180,668,105, an annual average of $196,778,017. The specie value\r\nof the exports of domestic merchandise was $376,616,473 in 1870 and\r\n$883,925,947 in 1881, an increase of $507,309,474, or 135 per cent.\r\nThe value of imports was $435,958,408 in 1870 and $642,664,628 in 1881,\r\nan increase of $206,706,220, or 47 per cent.\r\n\r\nDuring each year from 1862 to 1879, inclusive, the exports of specie\r\nexceeded the imports. The largest excess of such exports over imports\r\nwas reached during the year 1864, when it amounted to $92,280,929. But\r\nduring the year ended June 30, 1880, the imports of coin and bullion\r\nexceeded the exports by $75,891,391, and during the last fiscal year\r\nthe excess of imports over exports was $91,168,650.\r\n\r\nIn the last annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury the attention\r\nof Congress was called to the fact that $469,651,050 in 5 per cent bonds\r\nand $203,573,750 in 6 per cent bonds would become redeemable during the\r\nyear, and Congress was asked to authorize the refunding of these bonds\r\nat a lower rate of interest. The bill for such refunding having failed\r\nto become a law, the Secretary of the Treasury in April last notified\r\nthe holders of the $195,690,400 6 per cent bonds then outstanding that\r\nthe bonds would be paid at par on the 1st day of July following, or that\r\nthey might be \"continued\" at the pleasure of the Government, to bear\r\ninterest at the rate of 3-1/2 per cent per annum.\r\n\r\nUnder this notice $178,055,150 of the 6 per cent bonds were continued at\r\nthe lower rate and $17,635,250 were redeemed.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May a like notice was given respecting the redemption\r\nor continuance of the $439,841,350 of 5 per cent bonds then outstanding,\r\nand of these $401,504,900 were continued at 3-1/3 per cent per annum and\r\n$38,336,450 redeemed.\r\n\r\nThe 6 per cent bonds of the loan of February 8, 1861, and of the Oregon\r\nwar debt, amounting together to $14,125,800, having matured during the\r\nyear, the Secretary of the Treasury gave notice of his intention to\r\nredeem the same, and such as have been presented have been paid from the\r\nsurplus revenues. There have also been redeemed at par $16,179,100 of\r\nthe 3-1/2 per cent \"continued\" bonds, making a total of bonds redeemed\r\nor which have ceased to bear interest during the year of $123,969,650.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the annual interest on the public debt through these\r\ntransactions is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  By reduction of interest to 3-1/2 per cent.          $10,473,952.25\r\n  By redemption of bonds                                 6,352,340.00\r\n                                                        _____________\r\n    Total                                               16,826,292.25\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 3-1/2 per cent bonds, being payable at the pleasure of the\r\nGovernment, are available for the investment of surplus revenues without\r\nthe payment of premiums.\r\n\r\nUnless these bonds can be funded at a much lower rate of interest than\r\nthey now bear, I agree with the Secretary of the Treasury that no\r\nlegislation respecting them is desirable.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for congratulation that the business of the country\r\nhas been so prosperous during the past year as to yield by taxation\r\na large surplus of income to the Government. If the revenue laws remain\r\nunchanged, this surplus must year by year increase, on account of the\r\nreduction of the public debt and its burden of interest and because\r\nof the rapid increase of our population. In 1860, just prior to the\r\ninstitution of our internal-revenue system, our population but slightly\r\nexceeded 30,000,000; by the census of 1880 it is now found to exceed\r\n50,000,000. It is estimated that even if the annual receipts and\r\nexpenditures should continue as at present the entire debt could be\r\npaid in ten years.\r\n\r\nIn view, however, of the heavy load of taxation which our people have\r\nalready borne, we may well consider whether it is not the part of wisdom\r\nto reduce the revenues, even if we delay a little the payment of the\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the time has arrived when the people may justly\r\ndemand some relief from their present onerous burden, and that by due\r\neconomy in the various branches of the public service this may readily\r\nbe afforded.\r\n\r\nI therefore concur with the Secretary in recommending the abolition\r\nof all internal-revenue taxes except those upon tobacco in its various\r\nforms and upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors, and except also\r\nthe special tax upon the manufacturers of and dealers in such articles.\r\nThe retention of the latter tax is desirable as affording the officers\r\nof the Government a proper supervision of these articles for the\r\nprevention of fraud. I agree with the Secretary of the Treasury that the\r\nlaw imposing a stamp tax upon matches, proprietary articles, playing\r\ncards, checks, and drafts may with propriety be repealed, and the law\r\nalso by which banks and bankers are assessed upon their capital and\r\ndeposits. There seems to be a general sentiment in favor of this course.\r\n\r\nIn the present condition of our revenues the tax upon deposits is\r\nespecially unjust. It was never imposed in this country until it was\r\ndemanded by the necessities of war, and was never exacted, I believe, in\r\nany other country even in its greatest exigencies. Banks are required to\r\nsecure their circulation by pledging with the Treasurer of the United\r\nStates bonds of the General Government. The interest upon these bonds,\r\nwhich at the time when the tax was imposed was 6 per cent, is now in\r\nmost instances 3-1/2 per cent. Besides, the entire circulation was\r\noriginally limited by law and no increase was allowable. When the\r\nexisting banks had practically a monopoly of the business, there was\r\nforce in the suggestion that for the franchise to the favored grantees\r\nthe Government might very properly exact a tax on circulation; but for\r\nyears the system has been free and the amount of circulation regulated\r\nby the public demand.\r\n\r\nThe retention of this tax has been suggested as a means of reimbursing\r\nthe Government for the expense of printing and furnishing the\r\ncirculating notes. If the tax should be repealed, it would certainly\r\nseem proper to require the national banks to pay the amount of such\r\nexpense to the Comptroller of the Currency.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps doubtful whether the immediate reduction of the rate of\r\ntaxation upon liquors and tobacco is advisable, especially in view of\r\nthe drain upon the Treasury which must attend the payment of arrears of\r\npensions. A comparison, however, of the amount of taxes collected under\r\nthe varying rates of taxation which have at different times prevailed\r\nsuggests the intimation that some reduction may soon be made without\r\nmaterial diminution of the revenue.\r\n\r\nThe tariff laws also need revision; but, that a due regard may be paid\r\nto the conflicting interests of our citizens, important changes should\r\nbe made with caution. If a careful revision can not be made at this\r\nsession, a commission such as was lately approved by the Senate and is\r\nnow recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury would doubtless lighten\r\nthe labors of Congress whenever this subject shall be brought to its\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of War will make known to you\r\nthe operations of that Department for the past year.\r\n\r\nHe suggests measures for promoting the efficiency of the Army without\r\nadding to the number of its officers, and recommends the legislation\r\nnecessary to increase the number of enlisted men to 30,000, the maximum\r\nallowed by law.\r\n\r\nThis he deems necessary to maintain quietude on our ever-shifting\r\nfrontier; to preserve peace and suppress disorder and marauding in new\r\nsettlements; to protect settlers and their property against Indians, and\r\nIndians against the encroachments of intruders; and to enable peaceable\r\nimmigrants to establish homes in the most remote parts of our country.\r\n\r\nThe Army is now necessarily scattered over such a vast extent of\r\nterritory that whenever an outbreak occurs reenforcements must be\r\nhurried from many quarters, over great distances, and always at heavy\r\ncost for transportation of men, horses, wagons, and supplies.\r\n\r\nI concur in the recommendations of the Secretary for increasing the Army\r\nto the strength of 30,000 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nIt appears by the Secretary's report that in the absence of disturbances\r\non the frontier the troops have been actively employed in collecting the\r\nIndians hitherto hostile and locating them on their proper reservations;\r\nthat Sitting Bull and his adherents are now prisoners at Fort Randall;\r\nthat the Utes have been moved to their new reservation in Utah; that\r\nduring the recent outbreak of the Apaches it was necessary to reenforce\r\nthe garrisons in Arizona by troops withdrawn from New Mexico; and that\r\nsome of the Apaches are now held prisoners for trial, while some have\r\nescaped, and the majority of the tribe are now on their reservation.\r\n\r\nThere is need of legislation to prevent intrusion upon the lands set\r\napart for the Indians. A large military force, at great expense, is\r\nnow required to patrol the boundary line between Kansas and the Indian\r\nTerritory. The only punishment that can at present be inflicted is the\r\nforcible removal of the intruder and the imposition of a pecuniary fine,\r\nwhich in most cases it is impossible to collect. There should be a\r\npenalty by imprisonment in such cases.\r\n\r\nThe separate organization of the Signal Service is urged by the\r\nSecretary of War, and a full statement of the advantages of such\r\npermanent organization is presented in the report of the Chief Signal\r\nOfficer. A detailed account of the useful work performed by the Signal\r\nCorps and the Weather Bureau is also given in that report.\r\n\r\nI ask attention to the statements of the Secretary of War regarding the\r\nrequisitions frequently made by the Indian Bureau upon the Subsistence\r\nDepartment of the Army for the casual support of bands and tribes of\r\nIndians whose appropriations are exhausted. The War Department should\r\nnot be left, by reason of inadequate provision for the Indian Bureau,\r\nto contribute for the maintenance of Indians.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Chief of Engineers furnishes a detailed account of the\r\noperations for the improvement of rivers and harbors.\r\n\r\nI commend to your attention the suggestions contained in this report in\r\nregard to the condition of our fortifications, especially our coast\r\ndefenses, and recommend an increase of the strength of the Engineer\r\nBattalion, by which the efficiency of our torpedo system would be\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nI also call your attention to the remarks upon the improvement of the\r\nSouth Pass of the Mississippi River, the proposed free bridge over the\r\nPotomac River at Georgetown, the importance of completing at an early\r\nday the north wing of the War Department building, and other\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary of War which appear in his report.\r\n\r\nThe actual expenditures of that Department for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1881, were $42,122,201.39. The appropriations for the year 1882\r\nwere $44,889,725.42. The estimates for 1883 are $44,541,276.91.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the condition of\r\nthat branch of the service and presents valuable suggestions for its\r\nimprovement. I call your especial attention also to the appended report\r\nof the Advisory Board which he convened to devise suitable measures for\r\nincreasing the efficiency of the Navy, and particularly to report as to\r\nthe character and number of vessels necessary to place it upon a footing\r\ncommensurate with the necessities of the Government.\r\n\r\nI can not too strongly urge upon you my conviction that every\r\nconsideration of national safety, economy, and honor imperatively\r\ndemands a thorough rehabilitation of our Navy.\r\n\r\nWith a full appreciation of the fact that compliance with the\r\nsuggestions of the head of that Department and of the Advisory Board\r\nmust involve a large expenditure of the public moneys, I earnestly\r\nrecommend such appropriations as will accomplish an end which seems to\r\nme so desirable.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more inconsistent with true public economy than\r\nwithholding the means necessary to accomplish the objects intrusted by\r\nthe Constitution to the National Legislature. One of those objects, and\r\none which is of paramount importance, is declared by our fundamental law\r\nto be the provision for the \"common defense.\" Surely nothing is more\r\nessential to the defense of the United States and of all our people\r\nthan the efficiency of our Navy.\r\n\r\nWe have for many years maintained with foreign governments the relations\r\nof honorable peace, and that such relations may be permanent is desired\r\nby every patriotic citizen of the Republic. But if we heed the teachings\r\nof history we shall not forget that in the life of every nation\r\nemergencies may arise when a resort to arms can alone save it from\r\ndishonor.\r\n\r\nNo danger from abroad now threatens this people, nor have we any cause\r\nto distrust the friendly professions of other governments. But for\r\navoiding as well as for repelling dangers that may threaten us in the\r\nfuture we must be prepared to enforce any policy which we think wise to\r\nadopt.\r\n\r\nWe must be ready to defend our harbors against aggression; to protect,\r\nby the distribution of our ships of war over the highways of commerce,\r\nthe varied interests of our foreign trade and the persons and property\r\nof our citizens abroad; to maintain everywhere the honor of our flag and\r\nthe distinguished position which we may rightfully claim among the\r\nnations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General is a gratifying exhibit of the\r\ngrowth and efficiency of the postal service.\r\n\r\nThe receipts from postage and other ordinary sources during the past\r\nfiscal year were $36,489,816.58. The receipts from the money-order\r\nbusiness were $295,581.39, making a total of $36,785,397.97. The\r\nexpenditure for the fiscal year was $39,251,736.46. The deficit supplied\r\nout of the general Treasury was $2,481,129.35, or 6.3 per cent of the\r\namount expended. The receipts were $3,469,918.63 in excess of those of\r\nthe previous year, and $4,575,397.97 in excess of the estimate made two\r\nyears ago, before the present period of business prosperity had fairly\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of letters mailed in this country in the last fiscal\r\nyear exceeded 1,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe registry system is reported to be in excellent condition, having\r\nbeen remodeled during the past four years with good results. The amount\r\nof registration fees collected during the last fiscal year was\r\n$712,882.20, an increase over the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877, of\r\n$345,443.40.\r\n\r\nThe entire number of letters and packages registered during the year was\r\n8,338,919, of which only 2,061 were lost or destroyed in transit.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the money-order system are multiplying yearly under\r\nthe impulse of immigration, of the rapid development of the newer States\r\nand Territories, and the consequent demand for additional means of\r\nintercommunication and exchange.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year 338 additional money-order offices have been\r\nestablished, making a total of 5,499 in operation at the date of this\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nDuring the year the domestic money orders aggregated in value\r\n$105,075,769.35\r\n\r\nA modification of the system is suggested, reducing the fees for money\r\norders not exceeding $5 from 10 cents to 5 cents and making the maximum\r\nlimit $100 in place of $50.\r\n\r\nLegislation for the disposition of unclaimed money orders in the\r\npossession of the Post-Office Department is recommended, in view of the\r\nfact that their total value now exceeds $1,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is again invited to the subject of\r\nestablishing a system of savings depositories in connection with the\r\nPost-Office Department.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of mail transportation show that during the past year\r\nrailroad routes have been increased in length 6,249 miles and in cost\r\n$1,114,382, while steamboat routes have been decreased in length 2,182\r\nmiles and in cost $134,054. The so-called star routes have been\r\ndecreased in length 3,949 miles and in cost $364,144.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the more expensive routes have been superseded by railroad\r\nservice. The cost of the star service must therefore rapidly decrease in\r\nthe Western States and Territories.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General, however, calls attention to the constantly\r\nincreasing cost of the railway mail service as a serious difficulty in\r\nthe way of making the Department self-sustaining.\r\n\r\nOur postal intercourse with foreign countries has kept pace with the\r\ngrowth of the domestic service. Within the past year several countries\r\nand colonies have declared their adhesion to the Postal Union. It now\r\nincludes all those which have an organized postal service except\r\nBolivia, Costa Rica, New Zealand, and the British colonies in Australia.\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated, great reductions have recently been made\r\nin the expense of the star-route service. The investigations of the\r\nDepartment of Justice and the Post-Office Department have resulted in\r\nthe presentation of indictments against persons formerly connected with\r\nthat service, accusing them of offenses against the United States. I\r\nhave enjoined upon the officials who are charged with the conduct of the\r\ncases on the part of the Government, and upon the eminent counsel who\r\nbefore my accession to the Presidency were called to their assistance,\r\nthe duty of prosecuting with the utmost vigor of the law all persons who\r\nmay be found chargeable with frauds upon the postal service.\r\n\r\nThe Acting Attorney-General calls attention to the necessity of\r\nmodifying the present system of the courts of the United States--a\r\nnecessity due to the large increase of business, especially in the\r\nSupreme Court. Litigation in our Federal tribunals became greatly\r\nexpanded after the close of the late war. So long as that expansion\r\nmight be attributable to the abnormal condition in which the community\r\nfound itself immediately after the return of peace, prudence required\r\nthat no change be made in the constitution of our judicial tribunals.\r\nBut it has now become apparent that an immense increase of litigation\r\nhas directly resulted from the wonderful growth and development of the\r\ncountry. There is no ground for belief that the business of the United\r\nStates courts will ever be less in volume than at present. Indeed, that\r\nit is likely to be much greater is generally recognized by the bench and\r\nbar.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that Congress has already given much consideration\r\nto this subject, I make no suggestion as to detail, but express the hope\r\nthat your deliberations may result in such legislation as will give\r\nearly relief to our overburdened courts.\r\n\r\nThe Acting Attorney-General also calls attention to the disturbance\r\nof the public tranquillity during the past year in the Territory of\r\nArizona. A band of armed desperadoes known as \"Cowboys,\" probably\r\nnumbering from fifty to one hundred men, have been engaged for months in\r\ncommitting acts of lawlessness and brutality which the local authorities\r\nhave been unable to repress. The depredations of these \"Cowboys\" have\r\nalso extended into Mexico, which the marauders reach from the Arizona\r\nfrontier. With every disposition to meet the exigencies of the case,\r\nI am embarrassed by lack of authority to deal with them effectually.\r\nThe punishment of crimes committed within Arizona should ordinarily,\r\nof course, be left to the Territorial authorities; but it is worthy\r\nconsideration whether acts which necessarily tend to embroil the United\r\nStates with neighboring governments should not be declared crimes\r\nagainst the United States. Some of the incursions alluded to may perhaps\r\nbe within the scope of the law (U.S. Revised Statutes, sec. 5286)\r\nforbidding \"military expeditions or enterprises\" against friendly\r\nstates; but in view of the speedy assembling of your body I have\r\npreferred to await such legislation as in your wisdom the occasion may\r\nseem to demand.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be thought proper to provide that the setting on foot\r\nwithin our own territory of brigandage and armed marauding expeditions\r\nagainst friendly nations and their citizens shall be punishable as an\r\noffense against the United States.\r\n\r\nI will add that in the event of a request from the Territorial\r\ngovernment for protection by the United States against \"domestic\r\nviolence\" this Government would be powerless to render assistance.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1795, chapter 36, passed at a time when Territorial\r\ngovernments received little attention from Congress, enforced this duty\r\nof the United States only as to the State governments. But the act of\r\n1807, chapter 39, applied also to Territories. This law seems to have\r\nremained in force until the revision of the statutes, when the provision\r\nfor the Territories was dropped. I am not advised whether this\r\nalteration was intentional or accidental; but as it seems to me that the\r\nTerritories should be offered the protection which is accorded to the\r\nStates by the Constitution, I suggest legislation to that end.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, too, that whatever views may prevail as to the policy\r\nof recent legislation by which the Army has ceased to be a part of the\r\n_posse comitatus_, an exception might well be made for permitting\r\nthe military to assist the civil Territorial authorities in enforcing\r\nthe laws of the United States. This use of the Army would not seem to\r\nbe within the alleged evil against which that legislation was aimed.\r\nFrom sparseness of population and other circumstances it is often quite\r\nimpracticable to summon a civil posse in places where officers of\r\njustice require assistance and where a military force is within easy\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior, with accompanying\r\ndocuments, presents an elaborate account of the business of that\r\nDepartment. A summary of it would be too extended for this place. I ask\r\nyour careful attention to the report itself.\r\n\r\nProminent among the matters which challenge the attention of Congress at\r\nits present session is the management of our Indian affairs. While this\r\nquestion has been a cause of trouble and embarrassment from the infancy\r\nof the Government, it is but recently that any effort has been made for\r\nits solution at once serious, determined, consistent, and promising\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIt has been easier to resort to convenient makeshifts for tiding over\r\ntemporary difficulties than to grapple with the great permanent problem,\r\nand accordingly the easier course has almost invariably been pursued.\r\n\r\nIt was natural, at a time when the national territory seemed almost\r\nillimitable and contained many millions of acres far outside the bounds\r\nof civilized settlements, that a policy should have been initiated which\r\nmore than aught else has been the fruitful source of our Indian\r\ncomplications.\r\n\r\nI refer, of course, to the policy of dealing with the various Indian\r\ntribes as separate nationalities, of relegating them by treaty\r\nstipulations to the occupancy of immense reservations in the West, and\r\nof encouraging them to live a savage life, undisturbed by any earnest\r\nand well-directed efforts to bring them under the influences of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe unsatisfactory results which have sprung from this policy are\r\nbecoming apparent to all.\r\n\r\nAs the white settlements have crowded the borders of the reservations,\r\nthe Indians, sometimes contentedly and sometimes against their will,\r\nhave been transferred to other hunting grounds, from which they have\r\nagain been dislodged whenever their new-found homes have Keen desired\r\nby the adventurous settlers.\r\n\r\nThese removals and the frontier collisions by which they have often been\r\npreceded have led to frequent and disastrous conflicts between the\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nIt is profitless to discuss here which of them has been chiefly\r\nresponsible for the disturbances whose recital occupies so large a space\r\nupon the pages of our history.\r\n\r\nWe have to deal with the appalling fact that though thousands of lives\r\nhave been sacrificed and hundreds of millions of dollars expended in the\r\nattempt to solve the Indian problem, it has until within the past few\r\nyears seemed scarcely nearer a solution than it was half a century ago.\r\nBut the Government has of late been cautiously but steadily feeling its\r\nway to the adoption of a policy which has already produced gratifying\r\nresults, and which, in my judgment, is likely, if Congress and the\r\nExecutive accord in its support, to relieve us ere long from the\r\ndifficulties which have hitherto beset us.\r\n\r\nFor the success of the efforts now making to introduce among the Indians\r\nthe customs and pursuits of civilized life and gradually to absorb them\r\ninto the mass of our citizens, sharing their rights and holden to their\r\nresponsibilities, there is imperative need for legislative action.\r\n\r\nMy suggestions in that regard will be chiefly such as have been already\r\ncalled to the attention of Congress and have received to some extent its\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nFirst. I recommend the passage of an act making the laws of the various\r\nStates and Territories applicable to the Indian reservations within\r\ntheir borders and extending the laws of the State of Arkansas to the\r\nportion of the Indian Territory not occupied by the Five Civilized\r\nTribes.\r\n\r\nThe Indian should receive the protection of the law. He should be\r\nallowed to maintain in court his rights of person and property. He has\r\nrepeatedly begged for this privilege. Its exercise would be very\r\nvaluable to him in his progress toward civilization.\r\n\r\nSecond. Of even greater importance is a measure which has been\r\nfrequently recommended by my predecessors in office, and in furtherance\r\nof which several bills have been from time to time introduced in both\r\nHouses of Congress. The enactment of a general law permitting the\r\nallotment in severalty, to such Indians, at least, as desire it, of a\r\nreasonable quantity of land secured to them by patent, and for their own\r\nprotection made inalienable for twenty or twenty-five years, is demanded\r\nfor their present welfare and their permanent advancement.\r\n\r\nIn return for such considerate action on the part of the Government,\r\nthere is reason to believe that the Indians in large numbers would be\r\npersuaded to sever they tribal relations and to engage at once in\r\nagricultural pursuits. Many of them realize the fact that their hunting\r\ndays are over and that it is now for their best interests to conform\r\ntheir manner of life to the new order of things. By no greater\r\ninducement than the assurance of permanent title to the soil can they\r\nbe led to engage in the occupation of tilling it.\r\n\r\nThe well-attested reports of their increasing interest in husbandry\r\njustify the hope and belief that the enactment of such a statute as I\r\nrecommend would be at once attended with gratifying results. A resort\r\nto the allotment system would have a direct and powerful influence in\r\ndissolving the tribal bond, which is so prominent a feature of savage\r\nlife, and which tends so strongly to perpetuate it.\r\n\r\nThird. I advise a liberal appropriation for the support of Indian\r\nschools, because of my confident belief that such a course is consistent\r\nwith the wisest economy.\r\n\r\nEven among the most uncultivated Indian tribes there is reported to be\r\na general and urgent desire on the part of the chiefs and older members\r\nfor the education of their children. It is unfortunate, in view of this\r\nfact, that during the past year the means which have been at the command\r\nof the Interior Department for the purpose of Indian instruction have\r\nproved to be utterly inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe success of the schools which are in operation at Hampton, Carlisle,\r\nand Forest Grove should not only encourage a more generous provision for\r\nthe support of those institutions, but should prompt the establishment\r\nof others of a similar character.\r\n\r\nThey are doubtless much more potent for good than the day schools upon\r\nthe reservation, as the pupils are altogether separated from the\r\nsurroundings of savage life and brought into constant contact with\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThere are many other phases of this subject which are of great interest,\r\nbut which can not be included within the becoming limits of this\r\ncommunication. They are discussed ably in the reports of the Secretary\r\nof the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.\r\n\r\nFor many years the Executive, in his annual message to Congress, has\r\nurged the necessity of stringent legislation for the suppression of\r\npolygamy in the Territories, and especially in the Territory of Utah.\r\nThe existing statute for the punishment of this odious crime, so\r\nrevolting to the moral and religious sense of Christendom, has been\r\npersistently and contemptuously violated ever since its enactment.\r\nIndeed, in spite of commendable efforts on the part of the authorities\r\nwho represent the United States in that Territory, the law has in very\r\nrare instances been enforced, and, for a cause to which reference will\r\npresently be made, is practically a dead letter.\r\n\r\nThe fact that adherents of the Mormon Church, which rests upon polygamy\r\nas its corner stone, have recently been peopling in large numbers Idaho,\r\nArizona, and other of our Western Territories is well calculated to\r\nexcite the liveliest interest and apprehension. It imposes upon Congress\r\nand the Executive the duty of arraying against this barbarous system all\r\nthe power which under the Constitution and the law they can wield for\r\nits destruction.\r\n\r\nReference has been already made to the obstacles which the United States\r\nofficers have encountered in their efforts to punish violations of law.\r\nProminent among these obstacles is the difficulty of procuring legal\r\nevidence sufficient to warrant a conviction even in the case of the most\r\nnotorious offenders.\r\n\r\nYour attention is called to a recent opinion of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, explaining its judgment of reversal in the case of Miles,\r\nwho had been convicted of bigamy in Utah. The court refers to the fact\r\nthat the secrecy attending the celebration of marriages in that\r\nTerritory makes the proof of polygamy very difficult, and the propriety\r\nis suggested of modifying the law of evidence which now makes a wife\r\nincompetent to testify against her husband.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion is approved. I recommend also the passage of an act\r\nproviding that in the Territories of the United States the fact that\r\na woman has been married to a person charged with bigamy shall not\r\ndisqualify her as a witness upon his trial for that offense. I further\r\nrecommend legislation by which any person solemnizing a marriage in any\r\nof the Territories shall be required, under stringent penalties for\r\nneglect or refusal, to file a certificate of such marriage in the\r\nsupreme court of the Territory.\r\n\r\nDoubtless Congress may devise other practicable measures for obviating\r\nthe difficulties which have hitherto attended the efforts to suppress\r\nthis iniquity. I assure you of my determined purpose to cooperate with\r\nyou in any lawful and discreet measures which may be proposed to that\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAlthough our system of government does not contemplate that the nation\r\nshould provide or support a system for the education of our people, no\r\nmeasures calculated to promote that general intelligence and virtue upon\r\nwhich the perpetuity of our institutions so greatly depends have ever\r\nbeen regarded with indifference by Congress or the Executive.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the public domain has been from time to time devoted\r\nto the promotion of education.\r\n\r\nThere is now a special reason why, by setting apart the proceeds of its\r\nsales of public lands or by some other course, the Government should aid\r\nthe work of education. Many who now exercise the right of suffrage are\r\nunable to read the ballot which they cast. Upon many who had just\r\nemerged from a condition of slavery were suddenly devolved the\r\nresponsibilities of citizenship in that portion of the country most\r\nimpoverished by war. I have been pleased to learn from the report of the\r\nCommissioner of Education that there has lately been a commendable\r\nincrease of interest and effort for their instruction; but all that can\r\nbe done by local legislation and private generosity should be\r\nsupplemented by such aid as can be constitutionally afforded by the\r\nNational Government.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that if any fund be dedicated to this purpose it may be\r\nwisely distributed in the different States according to the ratio of\r\nilliteracy, as by this means those localities which are most in need of\r\nsuch assistance will reap its special benefits.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture exhibits the results of\r\nthe experiments in which that Department has been engaged during the\r\npast year and makes important suggestions in reference to the\r\nagricultural development of the country.\r\n\r\nThe steady increase of our population and the consequent addition to\r\nthe number of those engaging in the pursuit of husbandry are giving\r\nto this Department a growing dignity and importance. The Commissioner's\r\nsuggestions touching its capacity for greater usefulness deserve\r\nattention, as it more and more commends itself to the interests which\r\nit was created to promote.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the Commissioner of Pensions that since\r\n1860 789,063 original pension claims have been filed; 450,949 of these\r\nhave been allowed and inscribed on the pension roll; 72,539 have been\r\nrejected and abandoned, being 13+ per cent of the whole number of claims\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nThere are now pending for settlement 265,575 original pension claims,\r\n227,040 of which were filed prior to July 1, 1880. These, when allowed,\r\nwill involve the payment of arrears from the date of discharge in case\r\nof an invalid and from date of death or termination of a prior right in\r\nall other cases.\r\n\r\nFrom all the data obtainable it is estimated that 15 per cent of the\r\nnumber of claims now pending will be rejected or abandoned. This would\r\nshow the probable rejection of 34,040 cases and the probable admission\r\nof about 193,000 claims, all of which involve the payment of arrears of\r\npension.\r\n\r\nWith the present force employed, the number of adjudications remaining\r\nthe same and no new business intervening, this number of claims\r\n(193,000) could be acted upon in a period of six years; and taking\r\nJanuary 1, 1884, as a near period from which to estimate in each case\r\nan average amount of arrears, it is found that every case allowed would\r\nrequire for the first payment upon it the sum of $1,350. Multiplying\r\nthis amount by the whole number of probable admissions gives\r\n$250,000,000 as the sum required for first payment. This represents the\r\nsum which must be paid upon claims which were filed before July 1, 1880,\r\nand are now pending and entitled to the benefits of the arrears act.\r\nFrom this amount ($250,000,000) may be deducted from ten to fifteen\r\nmillions for cases where, the claimant dying, there is no person who\r\nunder the law would be entitled to succeed to the pension, leaving\r\n$235,000,000 as the probable amount to be paid.\r\n\r\nIn these estimates no account has been taken of the 38,500 cases filed\r\nsince June 30, 1880, and now pending, which must receive attention as\r\ncurrent business, but which do not involve the payment of any arrears\r\nbeyond the date of filing the claim. Of this number it is estimated that\r\n86 per cent will be allowed.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, with the present force of the Pension Bureau (675\r\nclerks) it is estimated that it will take six years to dispose of the\r\nclaims now pending.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by the Commissioner of Pensions that by an addition of 250\r\nclerks (increasing the adjudicating force rather than the mechanical)\r\ndouble the amount of work could be accomplished, so that these cases\r\ncould be acted upon within three years.\r\n\r\nAside from the considerations of justice which, may be urged for a\r\nspeedy settlement of the claims now on the files of the Pension Office,\r\nit is no less important on the score of economy, inasmuch as fully\r\none-third of the clerical force of the office is now wholly occupied in\r\ngiving attention to correspondence with the thousands of claimants whose\r\ncases have been on the files for the past eighteen years. The fact that\r\na sum so enormous must be expended by the Government to meet demands for\r\narrears of pensions is an admonition to Congress and the Executive to\r\ngive cautious consideration to any similar project in the future. The\r\ngreat temptation to the presentation of fictitious claims afforded by\r\nthe fact that the average sum obtained upon each application is $1,300\r\nleads me to suggest the propriety of making some special appropriation\r\nfor the prevention of fraud.\r\n\r\nI advise appropriations for such internal improvements as the wisdom of\r\nCongress may deem to be of public importance. The necessity of improving\r\nthe navigation of the Mississippi River justifies a special allusion to\r\nthat subject. I suggest the adoption of some measure for the removal of\r\nobstructions which now impede the navigation of that great channel of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nIn my letter accepting the nomination for the Vice-Presidency I stated\r\nthat in my judgment--\r\n\r\n\r\n  No man should be the incumbent of an office the duties of which he is\r\n  for any cause unfit to perform; who is lacking in the ability, fidelity,\r\n  or integrity which a proper administration of such office demands. This\r\n  sentiment would doubtless meet with general acquiescence, but opinion\r\n  has been widely divided upon the wisdom and practicability of the\r\n  various reformatory schemes which have been suggested and of certain\r\n  proposed regulations governing appointments to public office.\r\n\r\n  The efficiency of such regulations has been distrusted mainly because\r\n  they have seemed to exalt mere educational and abstract tests above\r\n  general business capacity and even special fitness for the particular\r\n  work in hand. It seems to me that the rules which should be applied to\r\n  the management of the public service may properly conform in the main\r\n  to such as regulate the conduct of successful private business:\r\n\r\n  Original appointments should be based upon ascertained fitness.\r\n\r\n  The tenure of office should be stable.\r\n\r\n  Positions of responsibility should, so far as practicable, be filled by\r\n  the promotion of worthy and efficient officers.\r\n\r\n  The investigation of all complaints and the punishment of all official\r\n  misconduct should be prompt and thorough.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe views expressed in the foregoing letter are those which will govern\r\nmy administration of the executive office. They are doubtless shared by\r\nall intelligent and patriotic citizens, however divergent in their\r\nopinions as to the best methods of putting them into practical\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nFor example, the assertion that \"original appointments should be based\r\nupon ascertained fitness\" is not open to dispute.\r\n\r\nBut the question how in practice such fitness can be most effectually\r\nascertained is one which has for years excited interest and discussion.\r\nThe measure which, with slight variations in its details, has lately\r\nbeen urged upon the attention of Congress and the Executive has as\r\nits principal feature the scheme of competitive examination. Save for\r\ncertain exceptions, which need not here be specified, this plan would\r\nallow admission to the service only in its lowest grade, and would\r\naccordingly demand that all vacancies in higher positions should be\r\nfilled by promotion alone. In these particulars it is in conformity\r\nwith the existing civil-service system of Great Britain; and indeed the\r\nsuccess which has attended that system in the country of its birth is\r\nthe strongest argument which has been urged for its adoption here.\r\n\r\nThe fact should not, however, be overlooked that there are certain\r\nfeatures of the English system which have not generally been received\r\nwith favor in this country, even among the foremost advocates of\r\ncivil-service reform.\r\n\r\nAmong them are:\r\n\r\n1. A tenure of office which is substantially a life tenure.\r\n\r\n2. A limitation of the maximum age at which an applicant can enter\r\nthe service, whereby all men in middle life or older are, with some\r\nexceptions, rigidly excluded.\r\n\r\n3. A retiring allowance upon going out of office.\r\n\r\nThese three elements are as important factors of the problem as any of\r\nthe others. To eliminate them from the English system would effect a\r\nmost radical change in its theory and practice.\r\n\r\nThe avowed purpose of that system is to induce the educated young men of\r\nthe country to devote their lives to public employment by an assurance\r\nthat having once entered upon it they need never leave it, and that\r\nafter voluntary retirement they shall be the recipients of an annual\r\npension. That this system as an entirety has proved very successful in\r\nGreat Britain seems to be generally conceded even by those who once\r\nopposed its adoption.\r\n\r\nTo a statute which should incorporate all its essential features I\r\nshould feel bound to give my approval; but whether it would be for the\r\nbest interests of the public to fix upon an expedient for immediate and\r\nextensive application which embraces certain features of the English\r\nsystem, but excludes or ignores others of equal importance, may be\r\nseriously doubted, even by those who are impressed, as I am myself, with\r\nthe grave importance of correcting the evils which inhere in the present\r\nmethods of appointment.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, the English rule which shuts out persons above the age\r\nof 25 years from a large number of public employments is not to be made\r\nan essential part of our own system, it is questionable whether the\r\nattainment of the highest number of marks at a competitive examination\r\nshould be the criterion by which all applications for appointment should\r\nbe put to test. And under similar conditions it may also be questioned\r\nwhether admission to the service should be strictly limited to its\r\nlowest ranks.\r\n\r\nThere are very many characteristics which go to make a model civil\r\nservant. Prominent among them are probity, industry, good sense, good\r\nhabits, good temper, patience, order, courtesy, tact, self-reliance,\r\nmanly deference to superior officers, and manly consideration for\r\ninferiors. The absence of these traits is not supplied by wide knowledge\r\nof books, or by promptitude in answering questions, or by any other\r\nquality likely to be brought to light by competitive examination.\r\n\r\nTo make success in such a contest, therefore, an indispensable condition\r\nof public employment would very likely result in the practical exclusion\r\nof the older applicants, even though they might possess qualifications\r\nfar superior to their younger and more brilliant competitors.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions must not be regarded as evincing any spirit of\r\nopposition to the competitive plan, which has been to some extent\r\nsuccessfully employed already, and which may hereafter vindicate the\r\nclaim of its most earnest supporters; but it ought to be seriously\r\nconsidered whether the application of the same educational standard to\r\npersons of mature years and to young men fresh from school and college\r\nwould not be likely to exalt mere intellectual proficiency above other\r\nqualities of equal or greater importance.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the proposed system is the selection by promotion of\r\nall officers of the Government above the lowest grade, except such as\r\nwould fairly be regarded as exponents of the policy of the Executive\r\nand the principles of the dominant party.\r\n\r\nTo afford encouragement to faithful public servants by exciting in their\r\nminds the hope of promotion if they are found to merit it is much to be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nBut would it be wise to adopt a rule so rigid as to permit no other mode\r\nof supplying the intermediate walks of the service?\r\n\r\nThere are many persons who fill subordinate positions with great credit,\r\nbut lack those qualities which are requisite for higher posts of duty;\r\nand, besides, the modes of thought and action of one whose service in\r\na governmental bureau has been long continued are often so cramped by\r\nroutine procedure as almost to disqualify him from instituting changes\r\nrequired by the public interests. An infusion of new blood from time to\r\ntime into the middle ranks of the service might be very beneficial in\r\nits results.\r\n\r\nThe subject under discussion is one of grave importance. The evils which\r\nare complained of can not be eradicated at once; the work must be\r\ngradual.\r\n\r\nThe present English system is a growth of years, and was not created by\r\na single stroke of executive or legislative action.\r\n\r\nIts beginnings are found in an order in council promulgated in 1855, and\r\nit was after patient and cautious scrutiny of its workings that fifteen\r\nyears later it took its present shape.\r\n\r\nFive years after the issuance of the order in council, and at a time\r\nwhen resort had been had to competitive examinations as an experiment\r\nmuch more extensively than has yet been the case in this country, a\r\nselect committee of the House of Commons made a report to that House\r\nwhich, declaring its approval of the competitive plan, deprecated,\r\nnevertheless, any precipitancy in its general adoption as likely to\r\nendanger its ultimate success.\r\n\r\nDuring this tentative period the results of the two methods of pass\r\nexamination and competitive examination were closely watched and\r\ncompared. It may be that before we confine ourselves upon this important\r\nquestion within the stringent bounds of statutory enactment we may\r\nprofitably await the result of further inquiry and experiment.\r\n\r\nThe submission of a portion of the nominations to a central board of\r\nexaminers selected solely for testing the qualifications of applicants\r\nmay perhaps, without resort to the competitive test, put an end to the\r\nmischiefs which attend the present system of appointment, and it may be\r\nfeasible to vest in such a board a wide discretion to ascertain the\r\ncharacteristics and attainments of candidates in those particulars which\r\nI have already referred to as being no less important than mere\r\nintellectual attainment.\r\n\r\nIf Congress should deem it advisable at the present session to establish\r\ncompetitive tests for admission to the service, no doubts such as have\r\nbeen suggested shall deter me from giving the measure my earnest\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nAnd I urgently recommend, should there be a failure to pass any other\r\nact upon this subject, that an appropriation of $25,000 per year may be\r\nmade for the enforcement of section 1753 of the Revised Statutes.\r\n\r\nWith the aid thus afforded me I shall strive to execute the provisions\r\nof that law according to its letter and spirit.\r\n\r\nI am unwilling, in justice to the present civil servants of the\r\nGovernment, to dismiss this subject without declaring my dissent from\r\nthe severe and almost indiscriminate censure with which they have been\r\nrecently assailed. That they are as a class indolent, inefficient, and\r\ncorrupt is a statement which has been often made and widely credited;\r\nbut when the extent, variety, delicacy, and importance of their duties\r\nare considered the great majority of the employees of the Government\r\nare, in my judgment, deserving of high commendation.\r\n\r\nThe continuing decline of the merchant marine of the United States is\r\ngreatly to be deplored. In view of the fact that we furnish so large\r\na proportion of the freights of the commercial world and that our\r\nshipments are steadily and rapidly increasing, it is cause of surprise\r\nthat not only is our navigation interest diminishing, but it is less\r\nthan when our exports and imports were not half so large as now,\r\neither in bulk or value. There must be some peculiar hindrance to the\r\ndevelopment of this interest, or the enterprise and energy of American\r\nmechanics and capitalists would have kept this country at least abreast\r\nof our rivals in the friendly contest for ocean supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of iron for wood and of steam for sail have wrought\r\ngreat revolutions in the carrying trade of the world; but these changes\r\ncould not have been adverse to America if we had given to our navigation\r\ninterests a portion of the aid and protection which have been so wisely\r\nbestowed upon our manufactures. I commend the whole subject to the\r\nwisdom of Congress, with the suggestion that no question of greater\r\nmagnitude or farther reaching importance can engage their attention.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the Supreme Court of the United States declared unconstitutional\r\nthe statutes of certain States which imposed upon shipowners or\r\nconsignees a tax of $1.50 for each passenger arriving from a foreign\r\ncountry, or in lieu thereof required a bond to indemnify the State and\r\nlocal authorities against expense for the future relief or support of\r\nsuch passenger. Since this decision the expense attending the care and\r\nsupervision of immigrants has fallen on the States at whose ports they\r\nhave landed. As a large majority of such immigrants, immediately upon\r\ntheir arrival, proceed to the inland States and the Territories to seek\r\npermanent homes, it is manifestly unjust to impose upon the State whose\r\nshores they first reach, the burden which it now bears. For this reason,\r\nand because of the national importance of the subject, I recommend\r\nlegislation regarding the supervision and transitory care of immigrants\r\nat the ports of debarkation.\r\n\r\nI regret to state that the people of Alaska have reason to complain\r\nthat they are as yet unprovided with any form of government by which\r\nlife or property can be protected. While the extent of its population\r\ndoes not justify the application of the costly machinery of Territorial\r\nadministration, there is immediate necessity for constituting such a\r\nform of government as will promote the education of the people and\r\nsecure the administration of justice.\r\n\r\nThe Senate at its last session passed a bill providing for the\r\nconstruction of a building for the Library of Congress, but it failed\r\nto become a law. The provision of suitable protection for this great\r\ncollection of books and for the copyright department connected with it\r\nhas become a subject of national importance and should receive prompt\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia herewith\r\ntransmitted will inform you fully of the condition of the affairs of\r\nthe District.\r\n\r\nThey urge the vital importance of legislation for the reclamation and\r\nimprovement of the marshes and for the establishment of the harbor lines\r\nalong the Potomac River front.\r\n\r\nIt is represented that in their present condition these marshes\r\nseriously affect the health of the residents of the adjacent parts of\r\nthe city, and that they greatly mar the general aspect of the park in\r\nwhich stands the Washington Monument. This improvement would add to\r\nthat park and to the park south of the Executive Mansion a large area\r\nof valuable land, and would transform what is now believed to be a\r\ndangerous nuisance into an attractive landscape extending to the river\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nThey recommend the removal of the steam railway lines from the surface\r\nof the streets of the city and the location of the necessary depots in\r\nsuch places as may be convenient for the public accommodation, and they\r\ncall attention to the deficiency of the water supply, which seriously\r\naffects the material prosperity of the city and the health and comfort\r\nof its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI commend these subjects to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe importance of timely legislation with respect to the ascertainment\r\nand declaration of the vote for Presidential electors was sharply called\r\nto the attention of the people more than four years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that some well-defined measure may be devised before\r\nanother national election which will render unnecessary a resort to any\r\nexpedient of a temporary character for the determination of questions\r\nupon contested returns.\r\n\r\nQuestions which concern the very existence of the Government and the\r\nliberties of the people were suggested by the prolonged illness of the\r\nlate President and his consequent incapacity to perform the functions\r\nof his office.\r\n\r\nIt is provided by the second article of the Constitution, in the fifth\r\nclause of its first section, that \"in case of the removal of the\r\nPresident from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to\r\ndischarge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall\r\ndevolve on the Vice-President,\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the intendment of the Constitution in its specification of\r\n\"inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office\" as one\r\nof the contingencies which calls the Vice-President to the exercise of\r\nPresidential functions?\r\n\r\nIs the inability limited in its nature to long-continued intellectual\r\nincapacity, or has it a broader import?\r\n\r\nWhat must be its extent and duration?\r\n\r\nHow must its existence be established?\r\n\r\nHas the President whose inability is the subject of inquiry any voice\r\nin determining whether or not it exists, or is the decision of that\r\nmomentous and delicate question confided to the Vice-President, or is\r\nit contemplated by the Constitution that Congress should provide by law\r\nprecisely what should constitute inability and how and by what tribunal\r\nor authority it should be ascertained?\r\n\r\nIf the inability proves to be temporary in its nature, and during its\r\ncontinuance the Vice-President lawfully exercises the functions of the\r\nExecutive, by what tenure does he hold his office?\r\n\r\nDoes he continue as President for the remainder of the four years' term?\r\n\r\nOr would the elected President, if his inability should cease in the\r\ninterval, be empowered to resume his office?\r\n\r\nAnd if, having such lawful authority, he should exercise it, would the\r\nVice-President be thereupon empowered to resume his powers and duties\r\nas such?\r\n\r\nI can not doubt that these important questions will receive your early\r\nand thoughtful consideration.\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the gravity of the responsibilities which have so\r\nunexpectedly devolved upon me, it will be my constant purpose to\r\ncooperate with you in such measures as will promote the glory of the\r\ncountry and the prosperity of its people.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 17, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter, dated the 29th ultimo, from the Secretary\r\nof War, inclosing copy of a communication from the Mississippi River\r\nCommission, in which the commission recommends that an appropriation may\r\nbe made of $1,010,000 for \"closing existing gaps in levees,\" in addition\r\nto the like sum for which an estimate has already been submitted.\r\n\r\nThe subject is one of such importance that I deem it proper to recommend\r\nearly and favorable consideration of the recommendations of the\r\ncommission. Having possession of and jurisdiction over the river,\r\nCongress, with a view of improving its navigation and protecting the\r\npeople of the valley from floods, has for years caused surveys of the\r\nriver to be made for the purpose of acquiring knowledge of the laws that\r\ncontrol it and of its phenomena. By act approved June 28, 1879, the\r\nMississippi River Commission was created, composed of able engineers.\r\nSection 4 of the act provides that--\r\n\r\nIt shall be the duty of said commission to take into consideration and\r\nmature such plan or plans and estimates as will correct, permanently\r\nlocate, and deepen the channel and protect the banks of the Mississippi\r\nRiver; improve and give safety and ease to the navigation thereof;\r\nprevent destructive floods; promote and facilitate commerce, trade, and\r\nthe postal service.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of a law making appropriations in aid of these\r\nobjects can not be questioned. While the report of the commission\r\nsubmitted and the plans proposed for the river's improvement seem\r\njustified as well on scientific principles as by experience and the\r\napproval of the people most interested, I desire to leave it to the\r\njudgment of Congress to decide upon the best plan for the permanent and\r\ncomplete improvement of the navigation of the river and for the\r\nprotection of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe immense losses and widespread suffering of the people dwelling near\r\nthe river induce me to urge upon Congress the propriety of not only\r\nmaking an appropriation to close the gaps in the levees occasioned by\r\nthe recent floods, as recommended by the commission, but that Congress\r\nshould inaugurate measures for the permanent improvement of the\r\nnavigation of the river and security of the valley. It may be that such\r\na system of improvement would as it progressed require the appropriation\r\nof twenty or thirty millions of dollars. Even such an expenditure,\r\nextending, as it must, over several years, can not be regarded as\r\nextravagant in view of the immense interest involved. The safe and\r\nconvenient navigation of the Mississippi is a matter of concern to\r\nall sections of the country, but to the Northwest, with its immense\r\nharvests, needing cheap transportation to the sea, and to the\r\ninhabitants of the river valley, whose lives and property depend upon\r\nthe proper construction of the safeguards which protect them from the\r\nfloods, it is of vital importance that a well-matured and comprehensive\r\nplan for improvement should be put into operation with as little delay\r\nas possible. The cotton product of the region subject to the devastating\r\nfloods is a source of wealth to the nation and of great importance to\r\nkeeping the balances of trade in our favor.\r\n\r\nIt may not be inopportune to mention that this Government has imposed\r\nand collected some $70,000,000 by a tax on cotton, in the production of\r\nwhich the population of the Lower Mississippi is largely engaged, and it\r\ndoes not seem inequitable to return a portion of this tax to those who\r\ncontributed it, particularly as such an action will also result in an\r\nimportant gain to the country at large, and especially so to the great\r\nand rich States of the Northwest and the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

The differences indicated are such as\r\nexist between Chile and Peru, between Mexico and Guatemala, and between\r\nthe States of Central America.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that these differences would disappear before the time\r\nfixed for the meeting of the congress. This hope has not been realized.\r\n\r\nHaving observed that the authority of the President to convene such a\r\ncongress has been questioned, I beg leave to state that the Constitution\r\nconfers upon the President the power, by and with the advice and consent\r\nof the Senate, to make treaties, and that this provision confers the\r\npower to take all requisite measures to initiate them, and to this end\r\nthe President may freely confer with one or several commissioners or\r\ndelegates from other nations.. The congress contemplated by the\r\ninvitation could only effect any valuable results by its conclusions\r\neventually taking the form of a treaty of peace between the States\r\nrepresented; and, besides, the invitation to the States of North and\r\nSouth America is merely a preliminary act, of which constitutionality\r\nor the want of it can hardly be affirmed.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that while the international congress would have\r\nno power to affect the rights of nationalities there represented, still\r\nCongress might be unwilling to subject the existing treaty rights of\r\nthe United States on the Isthmus and elsewhere on the continent to be\r\nclouded and rendered uncertain by the expression of the opinions of\r\na congress composed largely of interested parties.\r\n\r\nI am glad to have it in my power to refer to the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, as I now do, the propriety of convening the suggested\r\ninternational congress, that I may thus be informed of its views, which\r\nit will be my pleasure to carry out.\r\n\r\nInquiry having been made by some of the Republics invited whether it is\r\nintended that this international congress shall convene, it is important\r\nthat Congress should at as early a day as is convenient inform me by\r\nresolution or otherwise of its opinion in the premises. My action will\r\nbe in harmony with such expression.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _Washington, November 29, 1881_.\r\n\r\nSIR:[10] The attitude of the United States with respect to the question\r\nof general peace on the American continent is well known through its\r\npersistent efforts for years past to avert the evils of warfare, or,\r\nthese efforts failing, to bring positive conflicts to an end through\r\npacific counsels or the advocacy of impartial arbitration. This attitude\r\nhas been consistently maintained, and always with such fairness as to\r\nleave no room for imputing to our Government any motive except the\r\nhumane and disinterested one of saving the kindred States of the\r\nAmerican continent from the burdens of war. The position of the United\r\nStates as the leading power of the New World might well give to its\r\nGovernment a claim to authoritative utterance for the purpose of\r\nquieting discord among its neighbors, with all of whom the most friendly\r\nrelations exist. Nevertheless, the good offices of this Government are\r\nnot and have not at any time been tendered with a show of dictation or\r\ncompulsion, but only as exhibiting the solicitous good will of a common\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nFor some years past a growing disposition has been manifested by certain\r\nStates of Central and South America to refer disputes affecting grave\r\nquestions of international relationship and boundaries to arbitration\r\nrather than to the sword. It has been on several such occasions a source\r\nof profound satisfaction to the Government of the United States to see\r\nthat this country is in a large measure looked to by all the American\r\npowers as their friend and mediator.\r\n\r\nThe just and impartial counsel of the President in such cases has never\r\nbeen withheld, and his efforts have been rewarded by the prevention of\r\nsanguinary strife or angry contentions between peoples whom we regard as\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this growing tendency convinces the President that the\r\ntime is ripe for a proposal that shall enlist the good will and active\r\ncooperation of all the States of the Western Hemisphere, both north and\r\nsouth, in the interest of humanity and for the common weal of nations.\r\n\r\nHe conceives that none of the Governments of America can be less\r\nalive than our own to the dangers and horrors of a state of war, and\r\nespecially of war between kinsmen. He is sure that none of the chiefs\r\nof Governments on the continent can be less sensitive than he is to the\r\nsacred duty of making every endeavor to do away with the chances of\r\nfratricidal strife. And he looks with hopeful confidence to such active\r\nassistance from them as will serve to show the broadness of our common\r\nhumanity and the strength of the ties which bind us all together as a\r\ngreat and harmonious system of American Commonwealths.\r\n\r\nImpressed by these views, the President extends to all the independent\r\ncountries of North and South America an earnest invitation to\r\nparticipate in a general congress to be held in the city of Washington\r\non the 24th day of November, 1882, for the purpose of considering and\r\ndiscussing the methods of preventing war between the nations of America.\r\nHe desires that the attention of the congress shall be strictly confined\r\nto this one great object; that its sole aim shall be to seek a way of\r\npermanently, averting the horrors of cruel and bloody combat between\r\ncountries, oftenest of one blood and speech, or the even worse calamity\r\nof internal commotion and civil strife; that it shall regard the\r\nburdensome and far-reaching consequences of such struggles, the legacies\r\nof exhausted finances, of oppressive debt, of onerous taxation, of\r\nruined cities, of paralyzed industries, of devastated fields, of\r\nruthless conscription, of the slaughter of men, of the grief of the\r\nwidow and the orphan, of imbittered resentments that long survive those\r\nwho provoked them and heavily afflict the innocent generations that come\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nThe President is especially desirous to have it understood that in\r\nputting forth this invitation the United States does not assume the\r\nposition of counseling, or attempting through the voice of the congress\r\nto counsel, any determinate solution of existing questions which may now\r\ndivide any of the countries of America. Such questions can not properly\r\ncome before the congress. Its mission is higher. It is to provide for\r\nthe interests of all in the future, not to settle the individual\r\ndifferences of the present. For this reason especially the President has\r\nindicated a day for the assembling of the congress so far in the future\r\nas to leave good ground for hope that by the time named the present\r\nsituation on the South Pacific coast will be happily terminated, and\r\nthat those engaged in the contest may take peaceable part in the\r\ndiscussion and solution of the general question affecting in an equal\r\ndegree the well-being of all.\r\n\r\nIt seems also desirable to disclaim in advance any purpose on the\r\npart of the United States to prejudge the issues to be presented to the\r\ncongress. It is far from the intent of this Government to appear before\r\nthe congress as in any sense the protector of its neighbors or the\r\npredestined and necessary arbitrator of their disputes. The United\r\nStates will enter into the deliberations of the congress on the\r\nsame footing as the other powers represented, and with the loyal\r\ndetermination to approach any proposed solution not merely in its own\r\ninterest or with a view to asserting its own power, but as a single\r\nmember among many coordinate and coequal States. So far as the influence\r\nof this Government may be potential, it will be exerted in the direction\r\nof conciliating whatever conflicting interests of blood or government or\r\nhistorical tradition may necessarily come together in response to a call\r\nembracing such vast and diverse elements.\r\n\r\nYou will present these views to the minister of foreign relations of\r\nMexico, enlarging, if need be, in such terms as will readily occur to\r\nyou, upon the great mission which it is within the power of the proposed\r\ncongress to accomplish in the interest of humanity, and upon the firm\r\npurpose of the United States to maintain a position of the most absolute\r\nand impartial friendship toward all. You will thereupon, in the name\r\nof the President of the United States, tender to His Excellency the\r\nPresident of the Mexican Republic a formal invitation to send two\r\ncommissioners to the congress, provided with such powers and\r\ninstructions on behalf of their Government as will enable them to\r\nconsider the questions brought before that body within the limit of\r\nsubmission contemplated by this invitation.\r\n\r\nThe United States as well as the other powers will in like manner be\r\nrepresented by two commissioners, so that equality and impartiality will\r\nbe amply secured in the proceedings of the congress.\r\n\r\nIn delivering this invitation through the minister of foreign affairs\r\nyou will read this dispatch to him and leave with him a copy, intimating\r\nthat an answer is desired by this Government as promptly as the just\r\nconsideration of so important a proposition will permit.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAMES G. BLAINE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Sent under the same date, _mutatis mutandis_, to the\r\nUnited States ministers in the Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Brazil,\r\nCentral America, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Uruguay, Peru,\r\nand Venezuela: also directly to the minister of foreign relations of\r\nEcuador, in which country the United States had no diplomatic\r\nrepresentative.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 18, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a note addressed\r\nby the minister plenipotentiary of Mexico to the Secretary of State,\r\nproposing the conclusion of a convention between the two countries for\r\ndefining the boundary between the United States and Mexico from the\r\nRio Grande westward to the Pacific Ocean by the erection of durable\r\nmonuments. I also lay before Congress a letter on the same subject, with\r\nits accompaniment, from the Secretary of War, to whom the proposition\r\nwas referred by the Secretary of State for the expression of his views\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nI deem it important that the boundary line between the two countries,\r\nas defined by existing treaties and already once surveyed, should\r\nbe run anew and defined by suitable permanent monuments. By so doing\r\nuncertainty will be prevented as to jurisdiction in criminal and\r\nmunicipal affairs, and questions be averted which may at any time in\r\nthe near future arise with the growth of population on the border.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I conceive that the willing and speedy assent of the\r\nGovernment of the United States to the proposal thus to determine the\r\nexisting stipulated boundary with permanence and precision will be in\r\nsome sense an assurance to Mexico that the unauthorized suspicion which\r\nof late years seems to have gained some credence in that Republic that\r\nthe United States covets and seeks to annex neighboring territory is\r\nwithout foundation. That which the United States seeks, and which the\r\ndefinite settlement of the boundary in the proposed manner will promote,\r\nis a confiding and friendly feeling between the two nations, leading to\r\nadvantageous commerce and closer commercial relations.\r\n\r\nI have to suggest that in accepting this proposal suitable provision\r\nbe made for an adequate military force on the frontier to protect the\r\nsurveying parties from hostile Indians. The troops so employed will at\r\nthe same time protect the settlers on the border and help to prevent\r\nmarauding on both sides by the nomadic Indians.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 25, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, a report from the Secretary of State, in relation to\r\nthe International Fisheries Exhibition which is to be held at London in\r\nMay, 1883. Fully approving of the suggestions contained in the report,\r\nI would earnestly recommend that favorable action be taken upon the\r\nsubject at the present session of Congress, in order that there may be\r\nample time for making the appropriations necessary to enable this\r\ncountry to participate in the exhibition.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 26, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nBy recent information received from official and other sources I am\r\nadvised that an alarming state of disorder continues to exist within the\r\nTerritory of Arizona, and that lawlessness has already gained such head\r\nthere as to require a resort to extraordinary means to repress it.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the Territory, under date of the 31st ultimo, reports\r\nthat violence and anarchy prevail, particularly in Cochise County and\r\nalong the Mexican border; that robbery, murder, and resistance to law\r\nhave become so common as to cease causing surprise, and that the people\r\nare greatly intimidated and losing confidence in the protection of the\r\nlaw. I transmit his communication herewith and call especial attention\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nIn a telegram from the General of the Army dated at Tucson, Ariz., on\r\nthe 11th instant, herewith transmitted, that officer states that he\r\nhears of lawlessness and disorders which seem well attested, and that\r\nthe civil officers have not sufficient force to make arrests and hold\r\nthe prisoners for trial or punish them when convicted.\r\n\r\nMuch of this disorder is caused by armed bands of desperadoes known\r\nas \"Cowboys,\" by whom depredations are not only committed within the\r\nTerritory, but it is alleged predatory incursions are made therefrom\r\ninto Mexico. In my message to Congress at the beginning of the present\r\nsession I called attention to the existence of these bands and suggested\r\nthat the setting on foot within our own territory of brigandage and\r\narmed marauding expeditions against friendly nations and their citizens\r\nbe made punishable as an offense against the United States. I renew this\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nTo effectually repress the lawlessness prevailing within the Territory a\r\nprompt execution of the process of the courts and vigorous enforcement\r\nof the laws against offenders are needed. This the civil authorities\r\nthere are unable to do without the aid of other means and forces than\r\nthey can now avail themselves of. To meet the present exigencies the\r\ngovernor asks that provision be made by Congress to enable him to employ\r\nand maintain temporarily a volunteer militia force to aid the civil\r\nauthorities, the members of which force to be invested with the same\r\npowers and authority as are conferred by the laws of the Territory upon\r\npeace officers thereof.\r\n\r\nOn the ground of economy as well as effectiveness, however, it appears\r\nto me to be more advisable to permit the cooperation with the civil\r\nauthorities of a part of the Army as a _posse comitatus_. Believing\r\nthat this, in addition to such use of the Army as may be made under the\r\npowers already conferred by section 5298, Revised Statutes, would be\r\nadequate to secure the accomplishment of the ends in view, I again call\r\nthe attention of Congress to the expediency of so amending section 15\r\nof the act of June 18, 1878, chapter 263, as to allow the military\r\nforces to be employed as a _posse comitatus_ to assist the civil\r\nauthorities within a Territory to execute the laws therein. This use of\r\nthe Army, as I have in my former message observed, would not seem to be\r\nwithin the alleged evil against which that legislation was aimed.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 20, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for its consideration with a view\r\nto ratification, a convention between the United States and Mexico,\r\nproviding for the reopening and retrying of the claims of Benjamin Weil\r\nand La Abra Silver Mining Company against Mexico, which was signed on\r\nthe 13th instant.\r\n\r\nA report of the Secretary of State, with its accompanying\r\ncorrespondence, transmitted to the Senate this day in response to the\r\nresolution of December 21, 1881, will show the antecedents of the\r\nnegotiation which resulted in the accompanying convention. In view of\r\nthe accumulation of testimony presented by Mexico relative to these two\r\nclaims, I have deemed it proper to avail myself of the authority given\r\nto the Executive by the Constitution, and of which authority the act of\r\nCongress of June 18, 1878, is declarative, to effect a rehearing of\r\nthese cases. I therefore empowered the Secretary of State to negotiate\r\nwith the minister of Mexico a convention to that end.\r\n\r\nThe more important correspondence preliminary to the treaty is herewith\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the stipulations of the treaty that the rehearing\r\nwill have no retroactive effect as to payments already distributed, that\r\nthe _bona fide_ interests of third parties are amply secured, and\r\nthat the Government of the United States is fully guarded against any\r\nliability resulting from the rehearing.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 26, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a supplementary convention between the United States and\r\nthe French Republic, signed at Washington on the 19th instant, extending\r\nthe term of duration of the commission organized under the convention of\r\nJanuary 15, 1880, between the two countries.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 29, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to the Senate resolution of the 15th\r\ninstant, a report of the Secretary of State and accompanying papers,\r\nrelating to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 29, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty between the United States and the Kingdom of\r\nKorea, or Chosen, concluded on the 22d May last. For the information of\r\nthe Senate the accompanying letter of the Secretary of State is also\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, August 1, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention concluded on the 29th of July, 1882, between\r\nthe United States and Mexico, providing for an international boundary\r\nsurvey to relocate the existing frontier line between the two countries\r\nwest of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 5, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State, submitted in\r\ncompliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n28th of June, calling for additional information respecting the case of\r\nAmerican citizens under arrest in Ireland.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, August 7, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, with a view to ratification, a\r\nconvention concluded this day between the United States of America\r\nand His Majesty the King of Spain, supplementary to the extradition\r\nconvention concluded between said countries on the 5th day of\r\nJanuary, 1877.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 4, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of Senate bill No. 71, entitled \"An act to\r\nexecute certain treaty stipulations relating to Chinese,\" I herewith\r\nreturn it to the Senate, in which it originated, with my objections to\r\nits passage.\r\n\r\nA nation is justified in repudiating its treaty obligations only when\r\nthey are in conflict with great paramount interests. Even then all\r\npossible reasonable means for modifying or changing those obligations\r\nby mutual agreement should be exhausted before resorting to the supreme\r\nright of refusal to comply with them.\r\n\r\nThese rules have governed the United States in their past intercourse\r\nwith other powers as one of the family of nations. I am persuaded that\r\nif Congress can feel that this act violates the faith of the nation as\r\npledged to China it will concur with me in rejecting this particular\r\nmode of regulating Chinese immigration, and will endeavor to find\r\nanother which shall meet the expectations of the people of the United\r\nStates without coming in conflict with the rights of China.\r\n\r\nThe present treaty relations between that power and the United States\r\nspring from an antagonism which arose between our paramount domestic\r\ninterests and our previous relations.\r\n\r\nThe treaty commonly known as the Burlingame treaty conferred upon\r\nChinese subjects the right of voluntary emigration to the United States\r\nfor the purposes of curiosity or trade or as permanent residents, and\r\nwas in all respects reciprocal as to citizens of the United States in\r\nChina. It gave to the voluntary emigrant coming to the United States\r\nthe right to travel there or to reside there, with all the privileges,\r\nimmunities, or exemptions enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the\r\nmost favored nation.\r\n\r\nUnder the operation of this treaty it was found that the institutions\r\nof the United States and the character of its people and their means of\r\nobtaining a livelihood might be seriously affected by the unrestricted\r\nintroduction of Chinese labor. Congress attempted to alleviate this\r\ncondition by legislation, but the act which it passed proved to be\r\nin violation of our treaty obligations, and, being returned by the\r\nPresident with his objections, failed to become a law.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic relief was then sought. A new treaty was concluded with\r\nChina. Without abrogating the Burlingame treaty, it was agreed to modify\r\nit so far that the Government of the United States might regulate,\r\nlimit, or suspend the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States\r\nor their residence therein, but that it should not absolutely prohibit\r\nthem, and that the limitation or suspension should be reasonable and\r\nshould apply only to Chinese who might go to the United States as\r\nlaborers, other classes not being included in the limitations. This\r\ntreaty is unilateral, not reciprocal. It is a concession from China to\r\nthe United States in limitation of the rights which she was enjoying\r\nunder the Burlingame treaty. It leaves us by our own act to determine\r\nwhen and how we will enforce those limitations. China may therefore\r\nfairly have a right to expect that in enforcing them we will take good\r\ncare not to overstep the grant and take more than has been conceded\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nIt is but a year since this new treaty, under the operation of the\r\nConstitution, became part of the supreme law of the land, and the\r\npresent act is the first attempt to exercise the more enlarged powers\r\nwhich it relinquishes to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn its first article the United States is empowered to decide whether\r\nthe coming of Chinese laborers to the United States or their residence\r\ntherein affects or threatens to affect our interests or to endanger good\r\norder, either within the whole country or in any part of it. The act\r\nrecites that \"in the opinion of the Government of the United States the\r\ncoming of Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of\r\ncertain localities thereof.\" But the act itself is much broader than\r\nthe recital. It acts upon residence as well as immigration, and its\r\nprovisions are effective throughout the United States. I think it may\r\nfairly be accepted as an expression of the opinion of Congress that the\r\ncoming of such laborers to the United States or their residence here\r\naffects our interests and endangers good order throughout the country.\r\nOn this point I should feel it my duty to accept the views of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe first article further confers the power upon this Government to\r\nregulate, limit, or suspend, but not actually to prohibit, the coming\r\nof such laborers to or their residence in the United States. The\r\nnegotiators of the treaty have recorded with unusual fullness their\r\nunderstanding of the sense and meaning with which these words were used.\r\n\r\nAs to the class of persons to be affected by the treaty, the Americans\r\ninserted in their draft a provision that the words \"Chinese laborers\"\r\nsignify all immigration other than that for \"teaching, trade, travel,\r\nstudy, and curiosity.\" The Chinese objected to this that it operated to\r\ninclude artisans in the class of laborers whose immigration might be\r\nforbidden. The Americans replied that they \"could\" not consent that\r\nartisans shall be excluded from the class of Chinese laborers, for it is\r\nthis very competition of skilled labor in the cities where the Chinese\r\nlabor immigration concentrates which has caused the embarrassment and\r\npopular discontent. In the subsequent negotiations this definition\r\ndropped out, and does not appear in the treaty. Article II of the treaty\r\nconfers the rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are\r\naccorded to citizens and subjects of the most favored nation upon\r\nChinese subjects proceeding to the United States as teachers, students,\r\nmerchants, or from curiosity. The American commissioners report that the\r\nChinese Government claimed that in this article they did by exclusion\r\nprovide that nobody should be entitled to claim the benefit of the\r\ngeneral provisions of the Burlingame treaty but those who might go to\r\nthe United States in those capacities or for those purposes. I accept\r\nthis as the definition of the word \"laborers\" as used in the treaty.\r\n\r\nAs to the power of legislating respecting this class of persons, the new\r\ntreaty provides that we \"may not absolutely prohibit\" their coming or\r\ntheir residence. The Chinese commissioners gave notice in the outset\r\nthat they would never agree to a prohibition of voluntary emigration.\r\nNotwithstanding this the United States commissioners submitted a draft,\r\nin which it was provided that the United States might \"regulate, limit,\r\nsuspend, or prohibit\" it. The Chinese refused to accept this. The\r\nAmericans replied that they were \"willing to consult the wishes of the\r\nChinese Government in preserving the principle of free intercourse\r\nbetween the people of the two countries, as established by existing\r\ntreaties, provided that the right of the United States Government to use\r\nits discretion in guarding against any possible evils of immigration of\r\nChinese laborers is distinctly recognized. Therefore if such concession\r\nremoves all difficulty on the part of the Chinese commissioners (but\r\nonly in that case) the United States commissioners will agree to remove\r\nthe word 'prohibit' from their article and to use the words 'regulate,\r\nlimit, or suspend.'\" The Chinese reply to this can only be inferred from\r\nthe fact that in the place of an agreement, as proposed by our\r\ncommissioners, that we might prohibit the coming or residence of Chinese\r\nlaborers, there was inserted in the treaty an agreement that we might\r\nnot do it.\r\n\r\nThe remaining words, \"regulate, limit, and suspend,\" first appear in the\r\nAmerican draft. When it was submitted to the Chinese, they said:\r\n\r\n  We infer that of the phrases regulate, limit, suspend, or prohibit,\r\n  the first is a general expression referring to the others. * * * We\r\n  are entirely ready to negotiate with your excellencies to the end that\r\n  a limitation either in point of time or of numbers may be fixed upon\r\n  the emigration of Chinese laborers to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent interview they said that \"by limitation in number they\r\nmeant, for example, that the United States, having, as they supposed,\r\na record of the number of immigrants in each year, as well as the total\r\nnumber of Chinese now there, that no more should be allowed to go in any\r\none year in future than either the greatest number which had gone in any\r\nyear in the past, or that the total number should never be allowed to\r\nexceed the number now there. As to limitation of time they meant, for\r\nexample, that Chinese should be allowed to go in alternate years, or\r\nevery third year, or, for example, that they should not be allowed to\r\ngo for two, three, or five years.\"\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent conference the Americans said:\r\n\r\n  The Chinese commissioners have in their project explicitly recognized\r\n  the right of the United States to use some discretion, and have\r\n  proposed a limitation as to time and number. This _is_ the right to\r\n  regulate, limit, or suspend.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of the conferences the Chinese asked the Americans whether they\r\ncould give them any idea of the laws which would be passed to carry the\r\npowers into execution. The Americans answered that this could hardly be\r\ndone; that the United States Government might never deem it necessary\r\nto exercise this power. It would depend upon circumstances. If Chinese\r\nimmigration concentrated in cities where it threatened public order,\r\nor if it confined itself to localities where it was an injury to the\r\ninterests of the American people, the Government of the United States\r\nwould undoubtedly take steps to prevent such accumulations of Chinese.\r\nIf, on the contrary, there was no large immigration, or if there were\r\nsections of the country where such immigration was clearly beneficial,\r\nthen the legislation of the United States under this power would be\r\nadapted to such circumstances. For example, there might be a demand for\r\nChinese labor in the South and a surplus of such labor in California,\r\nand Congress might legislate in accordance with these facts. In general\r\nthe legislation would be in view of and depend upon the circumstances\r\nof the situation at the moment such legislation became necessary. The\r\nChinese commissioners said this explanation was satisfactory; that they\r\nhad not intended to ask for a draft of any special act, but for some\r\ngeneral idea how the power would be exercised. What had just been said\r\ngave them the explanation which they wanted.\r\n\r\nWith this entire accord as to the meaning of the words they were about\r\nto employ and the object of the legislation which might be had in\r\nconsequence, the parties signed the treaty, in Article I of which--\r\n\r\n  The Government of China agrees that the Government of the United\r\n  States may regulate, limit, or suspend such coming or residence, but\r\n  may not absolutely prohibit it. The limitation or suspension shall\r\n  be reasonable, and shall apply only to Chinese who may go to the\r\n  United States as laborers, other classes not being included in the\r\n  limitations. Legislation taken in regard to Chinese laborers will be\r\n  of such a character only as is necessary to enforce the regulation,\r\n  limitation, or suspension of immigration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first section of the act provides that--\r\n\r\n  From and after the expiration of sixty days next after the passage\r\n  of this act, and until the expiration of twenty years next after the\r\n  passage of this act, the coming of Chinese laborers be, and the same\r\n  is hereby, suspended; and during such suspension it shall not be\r\n  lawful for any Chinese laborer to come, or, having so come after the\r\n  expiration of said sixty days, to remain within the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe examination which I have made of the treaty and of the declarations\r\nwhich its negotiators have left on record of the meaning of its language\r\nleaves no doubt in my mind that neither contracting party in concluding\r\nthe treaty of 1880 contemplated the passage of an act prohibiting\r\nimmigration for twenty years, which is nearly a generation, or thought\r\nthat such a period would be a reasonable suspension or limitation, or\r\nintended to change the provisions of the Burlingame treaty to that\r\nextent. I regard this provision of the act as a breach of our national\r\nfaith, and being unable to bring myself in harmony with the views of\r\nCongress on this vital point the honor of the country constrains me to\r\nreturn the act with this objection to its passage.\r\n\r\nDeeply convinced of the necessity of some legislation on this subject,\r\nand concurring fully with Congress in many of the objects which are\r\nsought to be accomplished, I avail myself of the opportunity to point\r\nout some other features of the present act which, in my opinion, can be\r\nmodified to advantage.\r\n\r\nThe classes of Chinese who still enjoy the protection of the Burlingame\r\ntreaty are entitled to the privileges, immunities, and exemptions\r\naccorded to citizens and subjects of the most favored nation. We have\r\ntreaties with many powers which permit their citizens and subjects to\r\nreside within the United States and carry on business under the same\r\nlaws and regulations which are enforced against citizens of the United\r\nStates. I think it may be doubted whether provisions requiring personal\r\nregistration and the taking out of passports which are not imposed upon\r\nnatives can be required of Chinese. Without expressing an opinion on\r\nthat point, I may invite the attention of Congress to the fact that\r\nthe system of personal registration and passports is undemocratic and\r\nhostile to the spirit of our institutions. I doubt the wisdom of\r\nputting an entering wedge of this kind into our laws. A nation like\r\nthe United States, jealous of the liberties of its citizens, may well\r\nhesitate before it incorporates into its polity a system which is fast\r\ndisappearing in Europe before the progress of liberal institutions.\r\nA wide experience has shown how futile such precautions are, and how\r\neasily passports may be borrowed, exchanged, or even forged by persons\r\ninterested to do so.\r\n\r\nIf it is, nevertheless, thought that a passport is the most convenient\r\nway for identifying the Chinese entitled to the protection of the\r\nBurlingame treaty, it may still be doubted whether they ought to be\r\nrequired to register. It is certainly our duty under the Burlingame\r\ntreaty to make their stay in the United States, in the operation of\r\ngeneral laws upon them, as nearly like that of our own citizens as we\r\ncan consistently with our right to shut out the laborers. No good\r\npurpose is served in requiring them to register.\r\n\r\nMy attention has been called by the Chinese minister to the fact that\r\nthe bill as it stands makes no provision for the transit across the\r\nUnited States of Chinese subjects now residing in foreign countries.\r\nI think that this point may well claim the attention of Congress in\r\nlegislating on this subject.\r\n\r\nI have said that good faith requires us to suspend the immigration of\r\nChinese laborers for a less period than twenty years; I now add that\r\ngood policy points in the same direction.\r\n\r\nOur intercourse with China is of recent date. Our first treaty with\r\nthat power is not yet forty years old. It is only since we acquired\r\nCalifornia and established a great seat of commerce on the Pacific that\r\nwe may be said to have broken down the barriers which fenced in that\r\nancient Monarchy. The Burlingame treaty naturally followed. Under the\r\nspirit which inspired it many thousand Chinese laborers came to the\r\nUnited States. No one can say that the country has not profited by their\r\nwork. They were largely instrumental in constructing the railways which\r\nconnect the Atlantic with the Pacific. The States of the Pacific Slope\r\nare full of evidences of their industry. Enterprises profitable alike to\r\nthe capitalist and to the laborer of Caucasian origin would have lain\r\ndormant but for them. A time has now come when it is supposed that they\r\nare not needed, and when it is thought by Congress and by those most\r\nacquainted with the subject that it is best to try to get along without\r\nthem. There may, however, be other sections of the country where this\r\nspecies of labor may be advantageously employed without interfering with\r\nthe laborers of our own race. In making the proposed experiment it may\r\nbe the part of wisdom as well as of good faith to fix the length of the\r\nexperimental period with reference to this fact.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the trade of the East is the key to national\r\nwealth and influence. The opening of China to the commerce of the whole\r\nworld has benefited no section of it more than the States of our own\r\nPacific Slope. The State of California, and its great maritime port\r\nespecially, have reaped enormous advantages from this source. Blessed\r\nwith an exceptional climate, enjoying an unrivaled harbor, with the\r\nriches of a great agricultural and mining State in its rear and the\r\nwealth of the whole Union pouring into it over its lines of railway,\r\nSan Francisco has before it an incalculable future if our friendly and\r\namicable relations with Asia remain undisturbed. It needs no argument to\r\nshow that the policy which we now propose to adopt must have a direct\r\ntendency to repel Oriental nations from us and to drive their trade\r\nand commerce into more friendly lands. It may be that the great and\r\nparamount interest of protecting our labor from Asiatic competition may\r\njustify us in a permanent adoption of this policy; but it is wiser in\r\nthe first place to make a shorter experiment, with a view hereafter of\r\nmaintaining permanently only such features as time and experience may\r\ncommend.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith copies of the papers relating to the recent treaty\r\nwith China, which accompanied the confidential message of President\r\nHayes to the Senate of the 10th January, 1881, and also a copy of a\r\nmemorandum respecting the act herewith returned, which was handed to\r\nthe Secretary of State by the Chinese minister in Washington.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 1, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States:_\r\n\r\nHerewith I return House bill No. 2744, entitled \"An act to regulate the\r\ncarriage of passengers by sea,\" without my approval. In doing this I\r\nregret that I am not able to give my assent to an act which has received\r\nthe sanction of the majority of both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe object proposed to be secured by the act is meritorious and\r\nphilanthropic. Some correct and accurate legislation upon this subject\r\nis undoubtedly necessary. Steamships that bring large bodies of\r\nemigrants must be subjected to strict legal enactments, so as to prevent\r\nthe passengers from being exposed to hardship and suffering; and such\r\nlegislation should be made as will give them abundance of space and air\r\nand light, protecting their health by affording all reasonable comforts\r\nand conveniences and by providing for the quantity and quality of the\r\nfood to be furnished and all of the other essentials of roomy, safe, and\r\nhealthful accommodations in their passage across the sea.\r\n\r\nA statute providing for all this is absolutely needed, and in the spirit\r\nof humane legislation must be enacted. The present act, by most of its\r\nprovisions, will obtain and secure this protection for such passengers,\r\nand were it not for some serious errors contained in it it would be most\r\nwillingly approved by me.\r\n\r\nMy objections are these: In the first section, in lines from 13 to 24,\r\ninclusive, it is provided \"that the compartments or spaces,\" etc.,\r\n\"shall be of sufficient dimensions to allow for each and any passenger,\"\r\netc., \"100 cubic feet, if the compartment or space is located on the\r\nfirst deck next below the uppermost deck of the vessel,\" etc., \"or 120\r\ncubic feet for each passenger,\" etc., \"if the compartment or space is\r\nlocated on the second deck below the uppermost deck of the vessel,\" etc.\r\n\"It shall not be lawful to carry or bring passengers on any deck other\r\nthan the two decks mentioned,\" etc.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the new and most of the improved ocean steamers have\r\na spar deck, which is above the main deck. The main deck was in\r\nthe old style of steamers the only uppermost deck. The spar deck is a\r\ncomparatively new feature of the large and costly steamships, and is now\r\npractically the uppermost deck. Below this spar deck is the main deck.\r\nBecause of the misuse of the words \"uppermost deck\" instead of the use\r\nof the words \"main deck\" by this act, the result will be to exclude\r\nnearly all of the large steamships from carrying passengers anywhere\r\nbut on the main deck and on the deck below, which is the steerage deck,\r\nand to leave the orlop, or lower deck, heretofore used for passengers,\r\nuseless and unoccupied by passengers. This objection, which is now\r\npresented in connection with others that will be presently explained,\r\nwill, if this act is enforced as it is now phrased, render useless for\r\npassenger traffic and expose to heavy loss all of the great ocean steam\r\nlines; and it will also hinder emigration, as there will not be ships\r\nenough that could accept these conditions to carry all who may now wish\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nThe use of the new and the hitherto unknown term \"uppermost deck\"\r\ncreates this difficulty, and I can not consent to have an abuse of terms\r\nlike this to operate thus injuriously to these large fleets of ships.\r\nThe passengers will not be benefited by such a statute, but emigration\r\nwill be hindered, if not for a while almost prevented for many.\r\n\r\nAgain, the act in the first section, from line 31 to line 35, inclusive,\r\nprovides: \"And such passengers shall not be carried or brought in any\r\nbetween-decks, nor in any compartment,\" etc., \"the clear height of which\r\nis less than 7 feet.\" Between the decks of all ships are the beams; they\r\nare about a foot in width. The legal method of ascertaining tonnage for\r\nthe purpose of taxation is to measure between the beams from the floor\r\nto the ceiling. If this becomes a law the space required would be 8 feet\r\nfrom floor to ceiling, and this is impracticable, for in all ships the\r\nspaces between decks are adjusted in proportion to the dimensions of\r\nthe ship; and if these spaces between decks are changed so as not to\r\ncorrespond in their proportions with the dimensions of the vessel,\r\nthe ship will not work well in the sea, her sailing qualities will\r\nbe injured, and she will be rendered unfit for service.\r\n\r\nIt is only in great ships of vast tonnage that the height between\r\ndecks can be increased. All the ordinary-sized ships are necessarily\r\nconstructed with 7 feet space in the interval between the beams from the\r\nfloor to the ceiling. To adopt this act, with this provision, would be\r\nto drive out of the service of transporting passengers most all of the\r\nsteamships now in such trade, and no practical good obtained by it, for\r\nreally, with the exception of the narrow beam, the space between the\r\ndecks is now 7 feet. The purpose of the space commanded by the act is to\r\nobtain sufficient air and ventilation, and that is actually now given to\r\nthe passenger by the 7 feet that exists in all of these vessels between\r\nfloor and ceiling.\r\n\r\nThere is also another objection that I must suggest. In section 12,\r\nfrom line 14 to line 24, it is provided: \"Before such vessel shall be\r\ncleared or may lawfully depart,\" etc., \"the master of said vessel shall\r\nfurnish,\" etc., \"a correct list of all passengers who have been or are\r\nintended to be taken on board the vessel, and shall specify,\" etc. This\r\nprovision would prevent the clearing of the vessel. Steam vessels start\r\nat an appointed hour and with punctuality. Down almost to the very hour\r\nof their departure new passengers, other than those who have engaged\r\ntheir passage, constantly come on board. If this provision is to be the\r\nlaw; they must be rejected, for the ship can not, without incurring\r\nheavy penalties, take passengers whose names are not set forth on the\r\nlist required before such vessel shall be cleared. They should be\r\nallowed to take such new passengers upon condition that they would\r\nfurnish an additional list containing such persons' names. There are\r\nother points of objection of a minor character that might be presented\r\nfor consideration if the bill could be reconsidered and amended, but the\r\nthree that I have recited are conspicuous defects in a bill that ought\r\nto be a code for such a purpose, clear and explicit, free from all such\r\nobjections. The practical result of this law would be to subject all of\r\nthe competing lines of large ocean steamers to great losses. By\r\nrestricting their carrying accommodations it would also stay the current\r\nof emigration that it is our policy to encourage as well as to protect.\r\nA good bill, correctly phrased, and expressing and naming in plain,\r\nwell-known technical terms the proper and usual places and decks where\r\npassengers are and ought to be placed and carried, will receive my\r\nprompt and immediate assent as a public necessity and blessing.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 1, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving watched with much interest the progress of House bill No. 6242,\r\nentitled \"An act making appropriations for the construction, repair,\r\nand preservation of certain works on rivers and harbors, and for other\r\npurposes,\" and having since it was received carefully examined it, after\r\nmature consideration I am constrained to return it herewith to the House\r\nof Representatives, in which it originated, without my signature and\r\nwith my objections to its passage.\r\n\r\nMany of the appropriations in the bill are clearly for the general\r\nwelfare and most beneficent in their character. Two of the objects for\r\nwhich provision is made were by me considered so important that I felt\r\nit my duty to direct to them the attention of Congress. In my annual\r\nmessage in December last I urged the vital importance of legislation for\r\nthe reclamation of the marshes and for the establishment of the harbor\r\nlines along the Potomac front. In April last, by special message,\r\nI recommended an appropriation for the improvement of the Mississippi\r\nRiver. It is not necessary that I say that when my signature would make\r\nthe bill appropriating for these and other valuable national objects\r\na law it is with great reluctance and only under a sense of duty that\r\nI withhold it.\r\n\r\nMy principal objection to the bill is that it contains appropriations\r\nfor purposes not for the common defense or general welfare, and which\r\ndo not promote commerce among the States. These provisions, on the\r\ncontrary, are entirely for the benefit of the particular localities\r\nin which it is proposed to make the improvements. I regard such\r\nappropriation of the public money as beyond the powers given by the\r\nConstitution to Congress and the President.\r\n\r\nI feel the more bound to withhold my signature from the bill because\r\nof the peculiar evils which manifestly result from this infraction of\r\nthe Constitution. Appropriations of this nature, to be devoted purely\r\nto local objects, tend to an increase in number and in amount. As the\r\ncitizens of one State find that money, to raise which they in common\r\nwith the whole country are taxed, is to be expended for local\r\nimprovements in another State, they demand similar benefits for\r\nthemselves, and it is not unnatural that they should seek to indemnify\r\nthemselves for such use of the public funds by securing appropriations\r\nfor similar improvements in their own neighborhood. Thus as the bill\r\nbecomes more objectionable it secures more support. This result is\r\ninvariable and necessarily follows a neglect to observe the\r\nconstitutional limitations imposed upon the lawmaking power.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations for river and harbor improvements have, under the\r\ninfluences to which I have alluded, increased year by year out of\r\nproportion to the progress of the country, great as that has been.\r\nIn 1870 the aggregate appropriation was $3,975,900; in 1875,\r\n$6,648,517.50; in 1880, $8,976,500; and in 1881, $11,451,000; while\r\nby the present act there is appropriated $18,743,875.\r\n\r\nWhile feeling every disposition to leave to the Legislature the\r\nresponsibility of determining what amount should be appropriated for\r\nthe purposes of the bill, so long as the appropriations are confined to\r\nobjects indicated by the grant of power, I can not escape the conclusion\r\nthat, as a part of the lawmaking power of the Government, the duty\r\ndevolves upon me to withhold my signature from a bill containing\r\nappropriations which in my opinion greatly exceed in amount the needs of\r\nthe country for the present fiscal year. It being the usage to provide\r\nmoney for these purposes by annual appropriation bills, the President\r\nis in effect directed to expend so large an amount of money within so\r\nbrief a period that the expenditure can not be made economically and\r\nadvantageously.\r\n\r\nThe extravagant expenditure of public money is an evil not to be\r\nmeasured by the value of that money to the people who are taxed for it.\r\nThey sustain a greater injury in the demoralizing effect produced upon\r\nthose who are intrusted with official duty through all the ramifications\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nThese objections could be removed and every constitutional purpose\r\nreadily attained should Congress enact that one-half only of the\r\naggregate amount provided for in the bill be appropriated for\r\nexpenditure during the fiscal year, and that the sum so appropriated be\r\nexpended only for such objects named in the bill as the Secretary of\r\nWar, under the direction of the President, shall determine; provided\r\nthat in no case shall the expenditure for any one purpose exceed the\r\nsum now designated by the bill for that purpose.\r\n\r\nI feel authorized to make this suggestion because of the duty\r\nimposed upon the President by the Constitution \"to recommend to the\r\nconsideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and\r\nexpedient,\" and because it is my earnest desire that the public works\r\nwhich are in progress shall suffer no injury. Congress will also convene\r\nagain in four months, when this whole subject will be open for their\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas it is provided in the laws of the United States that--\r\n\r\n  Whenever, by reason of unlawful obstructions, combinations, or\r\n  assemblages of persons or rebellion against the authority of the\r\n  Government of the United States, it shall become impracticable, in\r\n  the judgment of the President, to enforce by the ordinary course of\r\n  judicial proceedings the laws of the United States within any State\r\n  or Territory, it shall be lawful for the President to call forth the\r\n  militia of any or all the States and to employ such parts of the land\r\n  and naval forces of the United States as he may deem necessary to\r\n  enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United States or to\r\n  suppress such rebellion, in whatever State or Territory thereof the\r\n  laws of the United States may be forcibly opposed or the execution\r\n  thereof forcibly obstructed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd whereas it has been made to appear satisfactorily to me, by\r\ninformation received from the governor of the Territory of Arizona and\r\nfrom the General of the Army of the United States and other reliable\r\nsources, that in consequence of unlawful combinations of evil-disposed\r\npersons who are banded together to oppose and obstruct the execution of\r\nthe laws it has become impracticable to enforce by the ordinary course\r\nof judicial proceedings the laws of the United States within that\r\nTerritory, and that the laws of the United States have been therein\r\nforcibly opposed and the execution thereof forcibly resisted; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the laws of the United States require that whenever it may be\r\nnecessary, in the judgment of the President, to use the military forces\r\nfor the purpose of enforcing the faithful execution of the laws of the\r\nUnited States, he shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such\r\ninsurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes\r\nwithin a limited time:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Chester A.

Arthur, President of the\r\nUnited States, do hereby set apart Thursday, the 30th day of November\r\nnext, as a day of public thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nThe blessings demanding our gratitude are numerous and varied. For the\r\npeace and amity which subsist between this Republic and all the nations\r\nof the world; for the freedom from internal discord and violence; for\r\nthe increasing friendship between the different sections of the land;\r\nfor liberty, justice, and constitutional government; for the devotion\r\nof the people to our free institutions and their cheerful obedience to\r\nmild laws; for the constantly increasing strength of the Republic while\r\nextending its privileges to fellow-men who come to us; for the improved\r\nmeans of internal communication and the increased facilities of\r\nintercourse with other nations; for the general prevailing health of the\r\nyear; for the prosperity of all our industries, the liberal return for\r\nthe mechanic's toil affording a market for the abundant harvests of\r\nthe husbandman; for the preservation of the national faith and credit;\r\nfor wise and generous provision to effect the intellectual and moral\r\neducation of our youth; for the influence upon the conscience of a\r\nrestraining and transforming religion, and for the joys of home--for\r\nthese and for many other blessings we should give thanks.\r\n\r\nWherefore I do recommend that the day above designated be observed\r\nthroughout the country as a day of national thanksgiving and prayer,\r\nand that the people, ceasing from their daily labors and meeting in\r\naccordance with their several forms of worship, draw near to the throne\r\nof Almighty God, offering to Him praise and gratitude for the manifold\r\ngoodness which He has vouchsafed to us and praying that His blessings\r\nand His mercies may continue.\r\n\r\nAnd I do further recommend that the day thus appointed be made a special\r\noccasion for deeds of kindness and charity to the suffering and the\r\nneedy, so that all who dwell within the land may rejoice and be glad in\r\nthis season of national thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 25th day of October, A.D. 1882, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the one hundred and seventh.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n_To all to whom these presents shall come, greeting_:\r\n\r\nWhereas on the 10th day of January, 1863, Fitz John Porter, then\r\nmajor-general of volunteers in the military service of the United\r\nStates, and also colonel of the Fifteenth Regiment of Infantry and\r\nbrevet brigadier-general in the United States Army, was by a general\r\ncourt-martial, for certain offenses of which he had been thereby\r\nconvicted, sentenced \"to be cashiered and to be forever disqualified\r\nfrom holding any office of trust or profit under the Government of the\r\nUnited States;\" and\r\n\r\nWhereas on the 21st day of January 1863, that sentence was duly\r\nconfirmed by the President of the United States, and by his order of the\r\nsame date carried into execution; and\r\n\r\nWhereas so much of that sentence as forever disqualified the said Fitz\r\nJohn Porter from holding office imposed upon him a continuing penalty\r\nand is still being executed; and\r\n\r\nWhereas doubts have since arisen concerning the guilt of the said Fitz\r\nJohn Porter of the offenses whereof he was convicted by the said\r\ncourt-martial, founded upon the result of an investigation ordered on\r\nthe 12th day of April, 1878, by the President of the United States,\r\nwhich are deemed by me to be of sufficient gravity to warrant the\r\nremission of that part of said sentence which has not yet been\r\ncompletely executed:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, know ye that I, Chester A. Arthur, President of the\r\nUnited States, by virtue of the power vested in me by the Constitution\r\nof the United States and in consideration of the premises, do hereby\r\ngrant to the said Fitz John Porter full remission of the\r\nhereinbeforementioned continuing penalty.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto signed my name and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 4th day of May, A.D. 1882, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the one hundred and sixth.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

By direction of the President, sections 1 and 2 of Article I of the\r\ngeneral regulations for the United States Military Academy are hereby\r\namended to read as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The General of the Army, under the War Department, shall have\r\nsupervision and charge of the United States Military Academy. He will\r\nwatch over its administration and discipline and the instruction of the\r\nCorps of Cadets, and will make reports thereof to the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n2. The Superintendent, and in his absence the next in rank, shall have\r\nthe immediate government and military command of the Academy, and shall\r\nbe commandant of the military post of West Point. The Superintendent\r\nwill render, through the Adjutant-General, to the General of the Army,\r\nfor submission to the Secretary of War, all required reports, returns,\r\nand estimates concerning the Academy.\r\n\r\nROBERT T. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 4, 1882_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt is provided by the Constitution that the President shall from time\r\nto time give to the Congress information of the state of the Union and\r\nrecommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge\r\nnecessary and expedient.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the events of the year which has elapsed since the\r\ncommencement of your sessions, I first call your attention to the\r\ngratifying condition of our foreign affairs. Our intercourse with other\r\npowers has continued to be of the most friendly character.\r\n\r\nSuch slight differences as have arisen during the year have been\r\nalready settled or are likely to reach an early adjustment. The arrest\r\nof citizens of the United States in Ireland under recent laws which owe\r\ntheir origin to the disturbed condition of that country has led to a\r\nsomewhat extended correspondence with the Government of Great Britain.\r\nA disposition to respect our rights has been practically manifested by\r\nthe release of the arrested parties.\r\n\r\nThe claim of this nation in regard to the supervision and control of any\r\ninteroceanic canal across the American Isthmus has continued to be the\r\nsubject of conference.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that time will be more powerful than discussion in removing\r\nthe divergence between the two nations whose friendship is so closely\r\ncemented by the intimacy of their relations and the community of their\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nOur long-established friendliness with Russia has remained unshaken. It\r\nhas prompted me to proffer the earnest counsels of this Government that\r\nmeasures be adopted for suppressing the proscription which the Hebrew\r\nrace in that country has lately suffered. It has not transpired that\r\nany American citizen has been subjected to arrest or injury, but our\r\ncourteous remonstrance has nevertheless been courteously received. There\r\nis reason to believe that the time is not far distant when Russia will\r\nbe able to secure toleration to all faiths within her borders.\r\n\r\nAt an international convention held at Paris in 1880, and attended\r\nby representatives of the United States, an agreement was reached in\r\nrespect to the protection of trade-marks, patented articles, and the\r\nrights of manufacturing firms and corporations. The formulating into\r\ntreaties of the recommendations thus adopted is receiving the attention\r\nwhich it merits.\r\n\r\nThe protection of submarine cables is a subject now under consideration\r\nby an international conference at Paris. Believing that it is clearly\r\nthe true policy of this Government to favor the neutralization of this\r\nmeans of intercourse, I requested our minister to France to attend the\r\nconvention as a delegate. I also designated two of our eminent\r\nscientists to attend as our representatives at the meeting of an\r\ninternational committee at Paris for considering the adoption of a\r\ncommon unit to measure electric force.\r\n\r\nIn view of the frequent occurrence of conferences for the consideration\r\nof important matters of common interest to civilized nations, I\r\nrespectfully suggest that the Executive be invested by Congress with\r\ndiscretionary powers to send delegates to such conventions, and that\r\nprovision be made to defray the expenses incident thereto.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the United States and Spain as to the effect of\r\na judgment and certificate of naturalization has not yet been adjusted,\r\nbut it is hoped and believed that negotiations now in progress will\r\nresult in the establishment of the position which seems to this\r\nGovernment so reasonable and just.\r\n\r\nI have already called the attention of Congress to the fact that in the\r\nports of Spain and its colonies onerous fines have lately been imposed\r\nupon vessels of the United States for trivial technical offenses against\r\nlocal regulations. Efforts for the abatement of these exactions have\r\nthus far proved unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nI regret to inform you also that the fees demanded by Spanish consuls in\r\nAmerican ports are in some cases so large, when compared with the value\r\nof the cargo, as to amount in effect to a considerable export duty, and\r\nthat our remonstrances in this regard have not as yet received the\r\nattention which they seem to deserve.\r\n\r\nThe German Government has invited the United States to participate in\r\nan international exhibition of domestic cattle to be held at Hamburg in\r\nJuly, 1883. If this country is to be represented, it is important that\r\nin the early days of this session Congress should make a suitable\r\nappropriation for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe death of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to Italy, has evoked from that\r\nGovernment expressions of profound respect for his exalted character\r\nand for his honorable career in the diplomatic service of his country.\r\nThe Italian Government has raised a question as to the propriety of\r\nrecognizing in his dual capacity the representative of this country\r\nrecently accredited both as secretary of legation and as consul-general\r\nat Rome. He has been received as secretary, but his exequatur as\r\nconsul-general has thus far been withheld.\r\n\r\nThe extradition convention with Belgium, which has been in operation\r\nsince 1874, has been lately supplanted by another. The Senate has\r\nsignified its approval, and ratifications have been duly exchanged\r\nbetween the contracting countries. To the list of extraditable crimes\r\nhas been added that of the assassination or attempted assassination of\r\nthe chief of the State.\r\n\r\nNegotiations have been opened with Switzerland looking to a settlement\r\nby treaty of the question whether its citizens can renounce their\r\nallegiance and become citizens of the United States without obtaining\r\nthe consent of the Swiss Government.\r\n\r\nI am glad to inform you that the immigration of paupers and criminals\r\nfrom certain of the Cantons of Switzerland has substantially ceased and\r\nis no longer sanctioned by the authorities.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of this subject prompts the suggestion that the act of\r\nAugust 3, 1882, which has for its object the return of foreign convicts\r\nto their own country, should be so modified as not to be open to the\r\ninterpretation that it affects the extradition of criminals on preferred\r\ncharges of crime.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Porte has not yet assented to the interpretation which\r\nthis Government has put upon the treaty of 1830 relative to its\r\njurisdictional rights in Turkey. It may well be, however, that this\r\ndifference will be adjusted by a general revision of the system of\r\njurisdiction of the United States in the countries of the East, a\r\nsubject to which your attention has been already called by the Secretary\r\nof State.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of justice toward China and Japan, I trust that the\r\nquestion of the return of the indemnity fund to the Governments of those\r\ncountries will reach at the present session the satisfactory solution\r\nwhich I have already recommended, and which has recently been\r\nforeshadowed by Congressional discussion.\r\n\r\nThe treaty lately concluded with Korea awaits the action of the Senate.\r\n\r\nDuring the late disturbance in Egypt the timely presence of American\r\nvessels served as a protection to the persons and property of many of\r\nour own citizens and of citizens of other countries, whose governments\r\nhave expressed their thanks for this assistance.\r\n\r\nThe recent legislation restricting immigration of laborers from China\r\nhas given rise to the question whether Chinese proceeding to or from\r\nanother country may lawfully pass through our own.\r\n\r\nConstruing the act of May 6, 1882, in connection with the treaty of\r\nNovember 7, 1880, the restriction would seem to be limited to Chinese\r\nimmigrants coming to the United States as laborers, and would not forbid\r\na mere transit across our territory. I ask the attention of Congress to\r\nthe subject, for such action, if any, as may be deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nThis Government has recently had occasion to manifest its interest in\r\nthe Republic of Liberia by seeking to aid the amicable settlement of the\r\nboundary dispute now pending between that Republic and the British\r\npossession of Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nThe reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will become terminable after\r\nSeptember 9, 1883, on twelve months' notice by either party. While\r\ncertain provisions of that compact may have proved onerous, its\r\nexistence has fostered commercial relations which it is important to\r\npreserve. I suggest, therefore, that early consideration be given to\r\nsuch modifications of the treaty as seem to be demanded by the interests\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\nIn view of our increasing trade with both Hayti and Santo Domingo,\r\nI advise that provision be made for diplomatic intercourse with the\r\nlatter by enlarging the scope of the mission at Port an Prince.\r\n\r\nI regret that certain claims of American citizens against the Government\r\nof Hayti have thus far been urged unavailingly.\r\n\r\nA recent agreement with Mexico provides for the crossing of the frontier\r\nby the armed forces of either country in pursuit of hostile Indians. In\r\nmy message of last year I called attention to the prevalent lawlessness\r\nupon the borders and to the necessity of legislation for its\r\nsuppression. I again invite the attention of Congress to the subject.\r\n\r\nA partial relief from these mischiefs has been sought in a convention,\r\nwhich now awaits the approval of the Senate, as does also another\r\ntouching the establishment of the international boundary between the\r\nUnited States and Mexico. If the latter is ratified, the action of\r\nCongress will be required for establishing suitable commissions of\r\nsurvey. The boundary dispute between Mexico and Guatemala, which led\r\nthis Government to proffer its friendly counsels to both parties, has\r\nbeen amicably settled.\r\n\r\nNo change has occurred in our relations with Venezuela. I again invoke\r\nyour action in the matter of the pending awards against that Republic,\r\nto which reference was made by a special message from the Executive at\r\nyour last session.\r\n\r\nAn invitation has been received from the Government of Venezuela to\r\nsend representatives in July, 1883, to Caracas for participating in the\r\ncentennial celebration of the birth of Bolivar, the founder of South\r\nAmerican independence. In connection with this event it is designed\r\nto commence the erection at Caracas of a statue of Washington and\r\nto conduct an industrial exhibition which will be open to American\r\nproducts. I recommend that the United States be represented and that\r\nsuitable provision be made therefor.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the grade of our mission in Central America to the\r\nplenipotentiary rank, which was authorized by Congress at its late\r\nsession, has been since effected.\r\n\r\nThe war between Peru and Bolivia on the one side and Chile on the other\r\nbegan more than three years ago. On the occupation by Chile in 1880 of\r\nall the littoral territory of Bolivia, negotiations for peace were\r\nconducted under the direction of the United States. The allies refused\r\nto concede any territory, but Chile has since become master of the whole\r\ncoast of both countries and of the capital of Peru. A year since, as\r\nyou have already been advised by correspondence transmitted to you in\r\nJanuary last, this Government sent a special mission to the belligerent\r\npowers to express the hope that Chile would be disposed to accept a\r\nmoney indemnity for the expenses of the war and to relinquish her demand\r\nfor a portion of the territory of her antagonist.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation, which Chile declined to follow, this Government did\r\nnot assume to enforce; nor can it be enforced without resort to measures\r\nwhich would be in keeping neither with the temper of our people nor with\r\nthe spirit of our institutions.\r\n\r\nThe power of Peru no longer extends over its whole territory, and in the\r\nevent of our interference to dictate peace would need to be supplemented\r\nby the armies and navies of the United States. Such interference would\r\nalmost inevitably lead to the establishment of a protectorate--a result\r\nutterly at odds with our past policy, injurious to our present\r\ninterests, and full of embarrassments for the future.\r\n\r\nFor effecting the termination of hostilities upon terms at once just to\r\nthe victorious nation and generous to its adversaries, this Government\r\nhas spared no efforts save such as might involve the complications which\r\nI have indicated.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be deplored that Chile seems resolved to exact such\r\nrigorous conditions of peace and indisposed to submit to arbitration the\r\nterms of an amicable settlement. No peace is likely to be lasting that\r\nis not sufficiently equitable and just to command the approval of other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nAbout a year since invitations were extended to the nations of this\r\ncontinent to send representatives to a peace congress to assemble at\r\nWashington in November, 1882. The time of meeting was fixed at a period\r\nthen remote, in the hope, as the invitation itself declared, that in the\r\nmeantime the disturbances between the South American Republics would be\r\nadjusted. As that expectation seemed unlikely to be realized, I asked in\r\nApril last for an expression of opinion from the two Houses of Congress\r\nas to the advisability of holding the proposed convention at the time\r\nappointed. This action was prompted in part by doubts which mature\r\nreflection had suggested whether the diplomatic usage and traditions of\r\nthe Government did not make it fitting that the Executive should consult\r\nthe representatives of the people before pursuing a line of policy\r\nsomewhat novel in its character and far reaching in its possible\r\nconsequences. In view of the fact that no action was taken by Congress\r\nin the premises and that no provision had been made for necessary\r\nexpenses, I subsequently decided to postpone the convocation, and so\r\nnotified the several Governments which had been invited to attend.\r\n\r\nI am unwilling to dismiss this subject without assuring you of my\r\nsupport of any measures the wisdom of Congress may devise for the\r\npromotion of peace on this continent and throughout the world, and I\r\ntrust that the time is nigh when, with the universal assent of civilized\r\npeoples, all international differences shall be determined without\r\nresort to arms by the benignant processes of arbitration.\r\n\r\nChanges have occurred in the diplomatic representation of several\r\nforeign powers during the past year. New ministers from the Argentine\r\nRepublic, Austria-Hungary, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Japan, Mexico,\r\nthe Netherlands, and Russia have presented their credentials. The\r\nmissions of Denmark and Venezuela at this capital have been raised\r\nin grade. Switzerland has created a plenipotentiary mission to this\r\nGovernment, and an embassy from Madagascar and a minister from Siam\r\nwill shortly arrive.\r\n\r\nOur diplomatic intercourse has been enlarged by the establishment of\r\nrelations with the new Kingdom of Servia, by the creation of a mission\r\nto Siam, and by the restoration of the mission to Greece. The Shah of\r\nPersia has expressed his gratification that a chargé d'affaires will\r\nshortly be sent to that country, where the rights of our citizens have\r\nbeen hitherto courteously guarded by the representatives of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nI renew my recommendation of such legislation as will place the United\r\nStates in harmony with other maritime powers with respect to the\r\ninternational rules for the prevention of collisions at sea.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with your joint resolution of the 3d of August last,\r\nI have directed the Secretary of State to address foreign governments\r\nin respect to a proposed conference for considering the subject of\r\nthe universal adoption of a common prime meridian to be used in the\r\nreckoning of longitude and in the regulation of time throughout the\r\ncivilized world. Their replies will in due time be laid before you.\r\n\r\nAn agreement was reached at Paris in 1875 between the principal powers\r\nfor the interchange of official publications through the medium of their\r\nrespective foreign departments.\r\n\r\nThe admirable system which has been built up by the enterprise of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution affords a practical basis for our cooperation\r\nin this scheme, and an arrangement has been effected by which that\r\ninstitution will perform the necessary labor, under the direction of\r\nthe Department of State. A reasonable compensation therefor should be\r\nprovided by law.\r\n\r\nA clause in the act making appropriations for the diplomatic and\r\nconsular service contemplates the reorganization of both branches of\r\nsuch service on a salaried basis, leaving fees to inure to the benefit\r\nof the Treasury. I cordially favor such a project, as likely to correct\r\nabuses in the present system. The Secretary of State will present to you\r\nat an early day a plan for such reorganization.\r\n\r\nA full and interesting exhibit of the operations of the Treasury\r\nDepartment is afforded by the

banks, and of\r\nthose institutions there are now in operation 2,269, a larger number\r\nthan ever before. The value of their notes in active circulation on\r\nJuly 1, 1882, was $324,656,458.\r\n\r\nI commend to your attention the Secretary's views in respect to the\r\nlikelihood of a serious contraction of this circulation, and to the\r\nmodes by which that result may, in his judgment, be averted.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the coinage of silver dollars and the retirement of silver\r\ncertificates, I have seen nothing to alter but much to confirm the\r\nsentiments to which I gave expression last year.\r\n\r\nA comparison between the respective amounts of silver-dollar circulation\r\non November 1, 1881, and on November 1, 1882, shows a slight increase of\r\na million and a half of dollars; but during the interval there had been\r\nin the whole number coined an increase of twenty-six millions. Of the\r\none hundred and twenty-eight millions thus far minted, little more than\r\nthirty-five millions are in circulation. The mass of accumulated coin\r\nhas grown so great that the vault room at present available for storage\r\nis scarcely sufficient to contain it. It is not apparent why it is\r\ndesirable to continue this coinage, now so enormously in excess of the\r\npublic demand.\r\n\r\nAs to the silver certificates, in addition to the grounds which seemed\r\nlast year to justify their retirement may be mentioned the effect which\r\nis likely to ensue from the supply of gold certificates for whose\r\nissuance Congress recently made provision, and which are now in active\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nYou can not fail to note with interest the discussion by the Secretary\r\nas to the necessity of providing by legislation some mode of freeing\r\nthe Treasury of an excess of assets in the event that Congress fails\r\nto reach an early agreement for the reduction of taxation.\r\n\r\nI heartily approve the Secretary's recommendation of immediate and\r\nextensive reductions in the annual revenues of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that I urged upon the attention of Congress at its\r\nlast session the importance of relieving the industry and enterprise of\r\nthe country from the pressure of unnecessary taxation. It is one of the\r\ntritest maxims of political economy that all taxes are burdensome,\r\nhowever wisely and prudently imposed; and though there have always been\r\namong our people wide differences of sentiment as to the best methods of\r\nraising the national revenues, and, indeed, as to the principles upon\r\nwhich taxation should be based, there has been substantial accord in the\r\ndoctrine that only such taxes ought to be levied as are necessary for a\r\nwise and economical administration of the Government. Of late the public\r\nrevenues have far exceeded that limit, and unless checked by appropriate\r\nlegislation such excess will continue to increase from year to year.\r\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 1881, the surplus revenue amounted\r\nto $100,000,000; for the fiscal year ended on the 30th of June last the\r\nsurplus was more than one hundred and forty-five millions.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary shows what disposition has been made of\r\nthese moneys. They have not only answered the requirements of the\r\nsinking fund, but have afforded a large balance applicable to other\r\nreductions of the public debt.\r\n\r\nBut I renew the expression of my conviction that such rapid\r\nextinguishment of the national indebtedness as is now taking place is by\r\nno means a cause for congratulation; it is a cause rather for serious\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\nIf it continues, it must speedily be followed by one of the evil results\r\nso clearly set forth in the report of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nEither the surplus must lie idle in the Treasury or the Government\r\nwill be forced to buy at market rates its bonds not then redeemable,\r\nand which under such circumstances can not fail to command an enormous\r\npremium, or the swollen revenues will be devoted to extravagant\r\nexpenditure, which, as experience has taught, is ever the bane of an\r\noverflowing treasury.\r\n\r\nIt was made apparent in the course of the animated discussions which\r\nthis question aroused at the last session of Congress that the policy\r\nof diminishing the revenue by reducing taxation commanded the general\r\napproval of the members of both Houses.\r\n\r\nI regret that because of conflicting views as to the best methods by\r\nwhich that policy should be made operative none of its benefits have\r\nas yet been reaped.\r\n\r\nIn fulfillment of what I deem my constitutional duty, but with little\r\nhope that I can make valuable contribution to this vexed question,\r\nI shall proceed to intimate briefly my own views in relation to it.\r\n\r\nUpon the showing of our financial condition at the close of the last\r\nfiscal year, I felt justified in recommending to Congress the abolition\r\nof all internal revenue taxes except those upon tobacco in its various\r\nforms and upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors, and except also\r\nthe special tax upon the manufacturers of and dealers in such articles.\r\n\r\nI venture now to suggest that unless it shall be ascertained that the\r\nprobable expenditures of the Government for the coming year have been\r\nunderestimated all internal taxes save those which relate to distilled\r\nspirits can be prudently abrogated.\r\n\r\nSuch a course, if accompanied by a simplification of the machinery of\r\ncollection, which would then be easy of accomplishment, might reasonably\r\nbe expected to result in diminishing the cost of such collection by at\r\nleast $2,500,000 and in the retirement from office of from 1,500 to\r\n2,000 persons.\r\n\r\nThe system of excise duties has never commended itself to the favor of\r\nthe American people, and has never been resorted to except for supplying\r\ndeficiencies in the Treasury when, by reason of special exigencies,\r\nthe duties on imports have proved inadequate for the needs of the\r\nGovernment. The sentiment of the country doubtless demands that the\r\npresent excise tax shall be abolished as soon as such a course can be\r\nsafely pursued.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, however, that, for various reasons, so sweeping a\r\nmeasure as the total abolition of internal taxes would for the present\r\nbe an unwise step.\r\n\r\nTwo of these reasons are deserving of special mention:\r\n\r\nFirst. It is by no means clear that even if the existing system of\r\nduties on imports is continued without modification those duties alone\r\nwill yield sufficient revenue for all the needs of the Government.\r\nIt is estimated that $100,000,000 will be required for pensions during\r\nthe coming year, and it may well be doubted whether the maximum annual\r\ndemand for that object has yet been reached. Uncertainty upon this\r\nquestion would alone justify, in my judgment, the retention for the\r\npresent of that portion of the system of internal revenue which is\r\nleast objectionable to the people.\r\n\r\nSecond. A total abolition of excise taxes would almost inevitably prove\r\na serious if not an insurmountable obstacle to a thorough revision of\r\nthe tariff and to any considerable reduction in import duties.\r\n\r\nThe present tariff system is in many respects unjust. It makes unequal\r\ndistributions both of its burdens and its benefits. This fact was\r\npractically recognized by a majority of each House of Congress in the\r\npassage of the act creating the Tariff Commission. The report of that\r\ncommission will be placed before you at the beginning of this session,\r\nand will, I trust, afford you such information as to the condition and\r\nprospects of the various commercial, agricultural, manufacturing,\r\nmining, and other interests of the country and contain such suggestions\r\nfor statutory revision as will practically aid your action upon this\r\nimportant subject.\r\n\r\nThe revenue from customs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879,\r\namounted to $137,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt has in the three succeeding years reached, first, $186,000,000, then\r\n$198,000,000, and finally, as has been already stated, $220,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe income from this source for the fiscal year which will end on June\r\n30, 1883, will doubtless be considerably in excess of the sum last\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIf the tax on domestic spirits is to be retained, it is plain,\r\ntherefore, that large reductions from the customs revenue are entirely\r\nfeasible. While recommending this reduction, I am far from advising the\r\nabandonment of the policy of so discriminating in the adjustment of\r\ndetails as to afford aid and protection to domestic labor. But the\r\npresent system should be so revised as to equalize the public burden\r\namong all classes and occupations and bring it into closer harmony with\r\nthe present needs of industry.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into minute detail, which under present circumstances\r\nis quite unnecessary, I recommend an enlargement of the free list so as\r\nto include within it the numerous articles which yield inconsiderable\r\nrevenue, a simplification of the complex and inconsistent schedule of\r\nduties upon certain manufactures, particularly those of cotton, iron,\r\nand steel, and a substantial reduction of the duties upon those articles\r\nand upon sugar, molasses, silk, wool, and woolen goods.\r\n\r\nIf a general revision of the tariff shall be found to be impracticable\r\nat this session, I express the hope that at least some of the more\r\nconspicuous inequalities of the present law may be corrected before\r\nyour final adjournment. One of them is specially referred to by the\r\nSecretary. In view of a recent decision of the Supreme Court, the\r\nnecessity of amending the law by which the Dutch standard of color is\r\nadopted as the test of the saccharine strength of sugars is too obvious\r\nto require comment.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of War it appears that the only\r\noutbreaks of Indians during the past year occurred in Arizona and in\r\nthe southwestern part of New Mexico. They were promptly quelled, and\r\nthe quiet which has prevailed in all other parts of the country has\r\npermitted such an addition to be made to the military force in the\r\nregion endangered by the Apaches that there is little reason to\r\napprehend trouble in the future.\r\n\r\nThose parts of the Secretary's report which relate to our seacoast\r\ndefenses and their armament suggest the gravest reflections. Our\r\nexisting fortifications are notoriously inadequate to the defense of\r\nthe great harbors and cities for whose protection they were built.\r\n\r\nThe question of providing an armament suited to our present necessities\r\nhas been the subject of consideration by a board, whose report was\r\ntransmitted to Congress at the last session. Pending the consideration\r\nof that report, the War Department has taken no steps for the\r\nmanufacture or conversion of any heavy cannon, but the Secretary\r\nexpresses the hope that authority and means to begin that important\r\nwork will be soon provided. I invite the attention of Congress to the\r\npropriety of making more adequate provision for arming and equipping\r\nthe militia than is afforded by the act of 1808, which is still upon\r\nthe statute book. The matter has already been the subject of discussion\r\nin the Senate, and a bill which seeks to supply the deficiencies of\r\nexisting laws is now upon its calendar.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War calls attention to an embarrassment growing out of\r\nthe recent act of Congress making the retirement of officers of the Army\r\ncompulsory at the age of 64. The act of 1878 is still in force, which\r\nlimits to 400 the number of those who can be retired for disability or\r\nupon their own application. The two acts, when construed together, seem\r\nto forbid the relieving, even for absolute incapacity, of officers who\r\ndo not fall within the purview of the later statute, save at such times\r\nas there chance to be less than 400 names on the retired list. There are\r\nnow 420. It is not likely that Congress intended this result, and I\r\nconcur with the Secretary that the law ought to be amended.\r\n\r\nThe grounds that impelled me to withhold my signature from the bill\r\nentitled \"An act making appropriations for the construction, repair,\r\nand preservation of certain works on rivers and harbors,\" which became\r\na law near the close of your last session, prompt me to express the hope\r\nthat no similar measure will be deemed necessary during the present\r\nsession of Congress. Indeed, such a measure would now be open to a\r\nserious objection in addition to that which was lately urged upon your\r\nattention. I am informed by the Secretary of War that the greater\r\nportion of the sum appropriated for the various items specified in that\r\nact remains unexpended.\r\n\r\nOf the new works which it authorized, expenses have been incurred upon\r\ntwo only, for which the total appropriation was $210,000. The present\r\navailable balance is disclosed by the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Amount of appropriation by act of August 2, 1882          $18,738,875\r\n  Amount of appropriation by act of June 19, 1882                10,000\r\n  Amount of appropriation for payments to J.B. Eads             304,000\r\n  Unexpended balance of former appropriations                 4,738,263\r\n                                                             __________\r\n                                                             23,791,138\r\n  Less amount drawn from Treasury between July 1, 1882,\r\n  and November 30, 1882                                       6,056,194\r\n                                                             __________\r\n                                                             17,734,944\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is apparent by this exhibit that so far as concerns most of the items\r\nto which the act of August 2, 1882, relates there can be no need of\r\nfurther appropriations until after the close of the present session.\r\nIf, however, any action should seem to be necessary in respect to\r\nparticular objects, it will be entirely feasible to provide for those\r\nobjects by appropriate legislation. It is possible, for example, that\r\na delay until the assembling of the next Congress to make additional\r\nprovision for the Mississippi River improvements might be attended with\r\nserious consequences. If such should appear to be the case, a just bill\r\nrelating to that subject would command my approval.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to offer a suggestion which I trust will commend itself to\r\nthe wisdom of Congress. Is it not advisable that grants of considerable\r\nsums of money for diverse and independent schemes of internal improvement\r\nshould be made the subjects of separate and distinct legislative\r\nenactments? It will scarcely be gainsaid, even by those who favor\r\nthe most liberal expenditures for such purposes as are sought to be\r\naccomplished by what is commonly called the river and harbor bill, that\r\nthe practice of grouping in such a bill appropriations for a great\r\ndiversity of objects, widely separated either in their nature or in the\r\nlocality with which they are concerned, or in both, is one which is\r\nmuch to be deprecated unless it is irremediable. It inevitably tends to\r\nsecure the success of the bill as a whole, though many of the items, if\r\nseparately considered, could scarcely fail of rejection. By the adoption\r\nof the course I have recommended every member of Congress, whenever\r\nopportunity should arise for giving his influence and vote for\r\nmeritorious appropriations, would be enabled so to do without being\r\ncalled upon to sanction others undeserving his approval. So also would\r\nthe Executive be afforded thereby full opportunity to exercise his\r\nconstitutional prerogative of opposing whatever appropriations seemed\r\nto him objectionable without imperiling the success of others which\r\ncommended themselves to his judgment.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged in opposition to these suggestions that the number of\r\nworks of internal improvement which are justly entitled to governmental\r\naid is so great as to render impracticable separate appropriation\r\nbills therefor, or even for such comparatively limited number as make\r\ndisposition of large sums of money. This objection may be well founded,\r\nand, whether it be or not, the advantages which would be likely to ensue\r\nfrom the adoption of the course I have recommended may perhaps be more\r\neffectually attained by another, which I respectfully submit to Congress\r\nas an alternative proposition.\r\n\r\nIt is provided by the constitutions of fourteen of our States that\r\nthe executive may disapprove any item or items of a bill appropriating\r\nmoney, whereupon the part of the bill approved shall be law and the part\r\ndisapproved shall fail to become law unless repassed according to the\r\nprovisions prescribed, for the passage of bills over the veto of the\r\nexecutive. The States wherein some such provision as the foregoing is a\r\npart of the fundamental law are Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida,\r\nGeorgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia. I commend to your\r\ncareful consideration the question whether an amendment of the Federal\r\nConstitution in the particular indicated would not afford the best\r\nremedy for what is often a grave embarrassment both to members of\r\nCongress and to the Executive, and is sometimes a serious public\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy states the movements of the\r\nvarious squadrons during the year, in home and foreign waters, where our\r\nofficers and seamen, with such ships as we possess, have continued to\r\nillustrate the high character and excellent discipline of the naval\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of December, 1881, information was received that the\r\nexploring steamer _Jeannette_ had been crushed and abandoned in\r\nthe Arctic Ocean. The officers and crew, after a journey over the ice,\r\nembarked in three boats for the coast of Siberia. One of the parties,\r\nunder the command of Chief Engineer George W. Melville, reached the\r\nland, and, falling in with the natives, was saved. Another, under\r\nLieutenant-Commander De Long, landed in a barren region near the mouth\r\nof the Lena River. After six weeks had elapsed all but two of the number\r\nhad died from fatigue and starvation. No tidings have been received from\r\nthe party in the third boat, under the command of Lieutenant Chipp, but\r\na long and fruitless investigation leaves little doubt that all its\r\nmembers perished at sea. As a slight tribute to their heroism I give\r\nin this communication the names of the gallant men who sacrificed their\r\nlives on this expedition: Lieutenant-Commander George W. De Long,\r\nSurgeon James M. Ambler, Jerome J. Collins, Hans Halmer Erichsen,\r\nHeinrich H. Kaacke, George W. Boyd, Walter Lee, Adolph Dressier,\r\nCarl A. Görtz, Nelse Iverson, the cook Ah Sam, and the Indian Alexy.\r\nThe officers and men in the missing boat were Lieutenant Charles W.\r\nChipp, commanding; William Dunbar, Alfred Sweetman, Walter Sharvell,\r\nAlbert C. Kuehne, Edward Star, Henry D. Warren, and Peter E. Johnson.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Giles B. Harber and Master William H. Scheutze are now,\r\nbringing home the remains of Lieutenant De Long and his comrades, in\r\npursuance of the directions of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe _Rodgers_, fitted out for the relief of the _Jeannette_ in\r\naccordance with the act of Congress of March 3, 1881, sailed from San\r\nFrancisco June 16 under the command of Lieutenant Robert M. Berry. On\r\nNovember 30 she was accidentally destroyed by fire while in winter\r\nquarters in St. Lawrence Bay, but the officers and crew succeeded in\r\nescaping to the shore. Lieutenant Berry and one of his officers, after\r\nmaking a search for the _Jeannette_ along the coast of Siberia,\r\nfell in with Chief Engineer Melville's party and returned home by way of\r\nEurope. The other officers and the crew of the _Rodgers_ were\r\nbrought from St. Lawrence Bay by the whaling steamer _North Star_.\r\nMaster Charles F. Putnam, who had been placed in charge of a depot of\r\nsupplies at Cape Serdze, returning to his post from St. Lawrence Bay\r\nacross the ice in a blinding snowstorm, was carried out to sea and lost,\r\nnotwithstanding all efforts to rescue him.\r\n\r\nIt appears by the Secretary's report that the available naval force of\r\nthe United States consists of 37 cruisers, 14 single-turreted monitors,\r\nbuilt during the rebellion, a large number of smoothbore guns and\r\nParrott rifles, and 87 rifled cannon.\r\n\r\nThe cruising vessels should be gradually replaced by iron or steel\r\nships, the monitors by modern armored vessels, and the armament by\r\nhigh-power rifled guns.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of our Navy, which was recommended in my last\r\nmessage, was begun by Congress authorizing, in its recent act, the\r\nconstruction of two large unarmored steel vessels of the character\r\nrecommended by the late Naval Advisory Board, and subject to the final\r\napproval of a new advisory board to be organized as provided by that\r\nact. I call your attention to the recommendation of the Secretary\r\nand the board that authority be given to construct two more cruisers\r\nof smaller dimensions and one fleet dispatch vessel, and that\r\nappropriations be made for high-power rifled cannon for the torpedo\r\nservice and for other harbor defenses.\r\n\r\nPending the consideration by Congress of the policy to be hereafter\r\nadopted in conducting the eight large navy-yards and their expensive\r\nestablishments, the Secretary advocates the reduction of expenditures\r\ntherefor to the lowest possible amounts.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of affording the officers and seamen of the Navy\r\nopportunities for exercise and discipline in their profession, under\r\nappropriate control and direction, the Secretary advises that the\r\nLight-House Service and Coast Survey be transferred, as now organized,\r\nfrom the Treasury to the Navy Department; and he also suggests, for the\r\nreasons which he assigns, that a similar transfer may wisely be made of\r\nthe cruising revenue vessels.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary forcibly depicts the intimate connection and\r\ninterdependence of the Navy and the commercial marine, and invites\r\nattention to the continued decadence of the latter and the corresponding\r\ntransfer of our growing commerce to foreign bottoms.\r\n\r\nThis subject is one of the utmost importance to the national welfare.\r\nMethods of reviving American shipbuilding and of restoring the United\r\nStates flag in the ocean carrying trade should receive the immediate\r\nattention of Congress. We have mechanical skill and abundant material\r\nfor the manufacture of modern iron steamships in fair competition\r\nwith our commercial rivals. Our disadvantage in building ships is the\r\ngreater cost of labor, and in sailing them, higher taxes, and greater\r\ninterest on capital, while the ocean highways are already monopolized\r\nby our formidable competitors. These obstacles should in some way be\r\novercome, and for our rapid communication with foreign lands we should\r\nnot continue to depend wholly upon vessels built in the yards of other\r\ncountries and sailing under foreign flags. With no United States\r\nsteamers on the principal ocean lines or in any foreign ports, our\r\nfacilities for extending our commerce are greatly restricted, while\r\nthe nations which build and sail the ships and carry the mails and\r\npassengers obtain thereby conspicuous advantages in increasing their\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General gives evidence of the satisfactory\r\ncondition of that Department and contains many valuable data and\r\naccompanying suggestions which can not fail to be of interest.\r\n\r\nThe information which it affords that the receipts for the fiscal year\r\nhave exceeded the expenditures must be very gratifying to Congress and\r\nto the people of the country.\r\n\r\nAs matters which may fairly claim particular attention, I refer you\r\nto his observations in reference to the advisability of changing the\r\npresent basis for fixing salaries and allowances, of extending the\r\nmoney-order system, and of enlarging the functions of the postal\r\nestablishment so as to put under its control the telegraph system of\r\nthe country, though from this last and most important recommendation\r\nI must withhold my concurrence.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress several bills were introduced into the\r\nHouse of Representatives for the reduction of letter postage to the rate\r\nof 2 cents per half ounce.\r\n\r\nI have given much study and reflection to this subject, and am\r\nthoroughly persuaded that such a reduction would be for the best\r\ninterests of the public.\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of the Government from its foundation to defray\r\nas far as possible the expenses of carrying the mails by a direct tax\r\nin the form of postage. It has never been claimed, however, that this\r\nservice ought to be productive of a net revenue.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated already, the report of the Postmaster-General shows\r\nthat there is now a very considerable surplus in his Department and that\r\nhenceforth the receipts are likely to increase at a much greater ratio\r\nthan the necessary expenditures. Unless some change is made in the\r\nexisting laws, the profits of the postal service will in a very few\r\nyears swell the revenues of the Government many millions of dollars.\r\nThe time seems auspicious, therefore, for some reduction in the rates\r\nof postage. In what shall that reduction consist?\r\n\r\nA review of the legislation which has been had upon this subject during\r\nthe last thirty years discloses that domestic letters constitute the\r\nonly class of mail matter which has never been favored by a substantial\r\nreduction of rates. I am convinced that the burden of maintaining the\r\nservice falls most unequally upon that class, and that more than any\r\nother it is entitled to present relief.\r\n\r\nThat such relief may be extended without detriment to other public\r\ninterests will be discovered upon reviewing the results of former\r\nreductions.\r\n\r\nImmediately prior to the act of 1845 the postage upon a letter composed\r\nof a single sheet was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If conveyed--                                               Cents.\r\n\r\n    30 miles or less                                              6\r\n    Between 30 and 80 miles                                      10\r\n    Between 80 and 150 miles                                     12-1/2\r\n    Between 150 and 400 miles                                    18-3/4\r\n    Over 400 miles                                               25\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the act of 1845 the postage upon a single letter conveyed for any\r\ndistance under 300 miles was fixed at 5 cents and for any greater\r\ndistance at 10 cents.\r\n\r\nBy the act of 1851 it was provided that a single letter, if prepaid,\r\nshould be carried any distance not exceeding 3,000 miles for 3 cents\r\nand any greater distance for 6 cents.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that both of these reductions were of a radical\r\ncharacter and relatively quite as important as that which is now\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nIn each case there ensued a temporary loss of revenue, but a sudden and\r\nlarge influx of business, which substantially repaired that loss within\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nUnless the experience of past legislation in this country and elsewhere\r\ngoes for naught, it may be safely predicted that the stimulus of 33-1/3\r\nper cent reduction in the tax for carriage would at once increase the\r\nnumber of letters consigned to the mails.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of secrecy would lead to a very general substitution of\r\nsealed packets for postal cards and open circulars, and in divers other\r\nways the volume of first-class matter would be enormously augmented.\r\nSuch increase amounted in England, in the first year after the adoption\r\nof penny postage, to more than 125 per cent.\r\n\r\nAs a result of careful estimates, the details of which can not be here\r\nset out, I have become convinced that the deficiency for the first year\r\nafter the proposed reduction would not exceed 7 per cent of the\r\nexpenditures, or $3,000,000, while the deficiency after the reduction of\r\n1845 was more than 14 per cent, and after that of 1851 was 27 per cent.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting comparison is afforded by statistics furnished me by\r\nthe Post-Office Department.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1845 was passed in face of the fact that there existed a\r\ndeficiency of more than $30,000. That of 1851 was encouraged by the\r\nslight surplus of $132,000. The excess of revenue in the next fiscal\r\nyear is likely to be $3,500,000.\r\n\r\nIf Congress should approve these suggestions, it may be deemed desirable\r\nto supply to some extent the deficiency which must for a time result by\r\nincreasing the charge for carrying merchandise, which is now only 16\r\ncents per pound; but even without such an increase I am confident that\r\nthe receipts under the diminished rates would equal the expenditures\r\nafter the lapse of three or four years.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Department of Justice brings anew to your notice the\r\nnecessity of enlarging the present system of Federal jurisprudence so as\r\neffectually to answer the requirements of the ever-increasing litigation\r\nwith which it is called upon to deal.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General renews the suggestions of his predecessor that in\r\nthe interests of justice better provision than the existing laws afford\r\nshould be made in certain judicial districts for fixing the fees of\r\nwitnesses and jurors.\r\n\r\nIn my message of December last I referred to pending criminal\r\nproceedings growing out of alleged frauds in what is known as the\r\nstar-route service of the Post-Office Department, and advised you that\r\nI had enjoined upon the Attorney-General and associate counsel, to whom\r\nthe interests of the Government were intrusted, the duty of prosecuting\r\nwith the utmost vigor of the law all persons who might be found\r\nchargeable with those offenses. A trial of one of these cases has since\r\noccurred. It occupied for many weeks the attention of the supreme court\r\nof this District and was conducted with great zeal and ability. It\r\nresulted in a disagreement of the jury, but the cause has been again\r\nplaced upon the calendar and will shortly be retried. If any guilty\r\npersons shall finally escape punishment for their offenses, it will\r\nnot be for lack of diligent and earnest efforts on the part of the\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\nI trust that some agreement may be reached which will speedily enable\r\nCongress, with the concurrence of the Executive, to afford the\r\ncommercial community the benefits of a national bankrupt law.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior, with its accompanying\r\ndocuments, presents a full statement of the varied operations of that\r\nDepartment. In respect to Indian affairs nothing has occurred which has\r\nchanged or seriously modified the views to which I devoted much space in\r\na former communication to Congress. I renew the recommendations therein\r\ncontained as to extending to the Indian the protection of the law,\r\nallotting land in severalty to such as desire it, and making suitable\r\nprovision for the education of youth. Such provision, as the Secretary\r\nforcibly maintains, will prove unavailing unless it is broad enough to\r\ninclude all those who are able and willing to make use of it, and should\r\nnot solely relate to intellectual training, but also to instruction in\r\nsuch manual labor and simple industrial arts as can be made practically\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nAmong other important subjects which are included within the Secretary's\r\nreport, and which will doubtless furnish occasion for Congressional\r\naction, may be mentioned the neglect of the railroad companies to which\r\nlarge grants of land were made by the acts of 1862 and 1864 to take\r\ntitle thereto, and their consequent inequitable exemption from local\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nNo survey of our material condition can fail to suggest inquiries as to\r\nthe moral and intellectual progress of the people.\r\n\r\nThe census returns disclose an alarming state of illiteracy in certain\r\nportions of the country, where the provision for schools is grossly\r\ninadequate. It is a momentous question for the decision of Congress\r\nwhether immediate and substantial aid should not be extended by the\r\nGeneral Government for supplementing the efforts of private beneficence\r\nand of State and Territorial legislation in behalf of education.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of interstate commerce has already been the subject of\r\nyour deliberations. One of the incidents of the marvelous extension of\r\nthe railway system of the country has been the adoption of such measures\r\nby the corporations which own or control the roads as have tended to\r\nimpair the advantages of healthful competition and to make hurtful\r\ndiscriminations in the adjustment of freightage.\r\n\r\nThese inequalities have been corrected in several of the States by\r\nappropriate legislation, the effect of which is necessarily restricted\r\nto the limits of their own territory.\r\n\r\nSo far as such mischiefs affect commerce between the States or between\r\nany one of the States and a foreign country, they are subjects of\r\nnational concern, and Congress alone can afford relief.\r\n\r\nThe results which have thus far attended the enforcement of the recent\r\nstatute for the suppression of polygamy in the Territories are reported\r\nby the Secretary of the Interior. It is not probable that any additional\r\nlegislation in this regard will be deemed desirable until the effect of\r\nexisting laws shall be more closely observed and studied.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you that the commissioners under whose supervision those\r\nlaws have been put in operation are encouraged to believe that the evil\r\nat which they are aimed may be suppressed without resort to such radical\r\nmeasures as in some quarters have been thought indispensable for\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe close relation of the General Government to the Territories\r\npreparing to be great States may well engage your special attention.\r\nIt is there that the Indian disturbances mainly occur and that polygamy\r\nhas found room for its growth. I can not doubt that a careful survey\r\nof Territorial legislation would be of the highest utility. Life and\r\nproperty would become more secure. The liability of outbreaks between\r\nIndians and whites would be lessened. The public domain would be more\r\nsecurely guarded and better progress be made in the instruction of the\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nAlaska is still without any form of civil government. If means were\r\nprovided for the education of its people and for the protection of their\r\nlives and property, the immense resources of the region would invite\r\npermanent settlements and open new fields for industry and enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture presents an account of the\r\nlabors of that Department during the past year and includes information\r\nof much interest to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the forests of the country and the wasteful manner\r\nin which their destruction is taking place give cause for serious\r\napprehension. Their action in protecting the earth's surface, in\r\nmodifying the extremes of climate, and in regulating and sustaining the\r\nflow of springs and streams is now well understood, and their importance\r\nin relation to the growth and prosperity of the country can not be\r\nsafely disregarded. They are fast disappearing before destructive fires\r\nand the legitimate requirements of our increasing population, and their\r\ntotal extinction can not be long delayed unless better methods than\r\nnow prevail shall be adopted for their protection and cultivation.\r\nThe attention of Congress is invited to the necessity of additional\r\nlegislation to secure the preservation of the valuable forests still\r\nremaining on the public domain, especially in the extreme Western States\r\nand Territories, where the necessity for their preservation is greater\r\nthan in less mountainous regions, and where the prevailing dryness of\r\nthe climate renders their restoration, if they are once destroyed,\r\nwell-nigh impossible.\r\n\r\nThe communication which I made to Congress at its first session, in\r\nDecember last, contained a somewhat full statement of my sentiments in\r\nrelation to the principles and rules which ought to govern appointments\r\nto public service.\r\n\r\nReferring to the various plans which had theretofore been the subject\r\nof discussion in the National Legislature (plans which in the main were\r\nmodeled upon the system which obtains in Great Britain, but which lacked\r\ncertain of the prominent features whereby that system is distinguished),\r\nI felt bound to intimate my doubts whether they, or any of them, would\r\nafford adequate remedy for the evils which they aimed to correct.\r\n\r\nI declared, nevertheless, that if the proposed measures should prove\r\nacceptable to Congress they would receive the unhesitating support of\r\nthe Executive.\r\n\r\nSince these suggestions were submitted for your consideration there has\r\nbeen no legislation upon the subject to which they relate, but there has\r\nmeanwhile been an increase in the public interest in that subject, and\r\nthe people of the country, apparently without distinction of party, have\r\nin various ways and upon frequent occasions given expression to their\r\nearnest wish for prompt and definite action. In my judgment such action\r\nshould no longer be postponed.\r\n\r\nI may add that my own sense of its pressing importance has been\r\nquickened by observation of a practical phase of the matter, to which\r\nattention has more than once been called by my predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe civil list now comprises about 100,000 persons, far the larger part\r\nof whom must, under the terms of the Constitution, be selected by the\r\nPresident either directly or through his own appointees.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the administration of the Government the personal\r\ndirection of appointments to the civil service may not have been an\r\nirksome task for the Executive, but now that the burden has increased\r\nfully a hundredfold it has become greater than he ought to bear, and it\r\nnecessarily diverts his time and attention from the proper discharge of\r\nother duties no less delicate and responsible, and which in the very\r\nnature of things can not be delegated to other hands.\r\n\r\nIn the judgment of not a few who have given study and reflection to this\r\nmatter, the nation has outgrown the provisions which the Constitution\r\nhas established for filling the minor offices in the public service.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be thought of the wisdom or expediency of changing the\r\nfundamental law in this regard, it is certain that much relief may be\r\nafforded, not only to the President and to the heads of the Departments,\r\nbut to Senators and Representatives in Congress, by discreet\r\nlegislation. They would be protected in a great measure by the bill now\r\npending before the Senate, or by any other which should embody its\r\nimportant features, from the pressure of personal importunity and from\r\nthe labor of examining conflicting claims and pretensions of candidates.\r\n\r\nI trust that before the close of the present session some decisive\r\naction may be taken for the correction of the evils which inhere\r\nin the present methods of appointment, and I assure you of my hearty\r\ncooperation in any measures which are likely to conduce to that end.\r\n\r\nAs to the most appropriate term and tenure of the official life of the\r\nsubordinate employees of the Government, it seems to be generally agreed\r\nthat, whatever their extent or character, the one should be definite and\r\nthe other stable, and that neither should be regulated by zeal in the\r\nservice of party or fidelity to the fortunes of an individual.\r\n\r\nIt matters little to the people at large what competent person is at\r\nthe head of this department or of that bureau if they feel assured that\r\nthe removal of one and the accession of another will not involve the\r\nretirement of honest and faithful subordinates whose duties are purely\r\nadministrative and have no legitimate connection with the triumph of any\r\npolitical principles or the success of any political party or faction.\r\nIt is to this latter class of officers that the Senate bill, to which\r\nI have already referred, exclusively applies.\r\n\r\nWhile neither that bill nor any other prominent scheme for improving the\r\ncivil service concerns the higher grade of officials, who are appointed\r\nby the President and confirmed by the Senate, I feel bound to correct\r\na prevalent misapprehension as to the frequency with which the present\r\nExecutive has displaced the incumbent of an office and appointed another\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\nIt has been repeatedly alleged that he has in this particular signally\r\ndeparted from the course which has been pursued under recent\r\nAdministrations of the Government. The facts are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe whole number of Executive appointments during the four years\r\nimmediately preceding Mr. Garfield's accession to the Presidency was\r\n2,696. Of this number 244, or 9 per cent, involved the removal of\r\nprevious incumbents.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of removals to the whole number of appointments was much the\r\nsame during each of those four years.\r\n\r\nIn the first year, with 790 appointments, there were 74 removals, or 9.3\r\nper cent; in the second, with 917 appointments, there were 85 removals,\r\nor 8.5 per cent; in the third, with 480 appointments, there were 48\r\nremovals, or 10 per cent; in the fourth, with 429 appointments, there\r\nwere 37 removals, or 8.6 per cent. In the four months of President\r\nGarfield's Administration there were 390 appointments and 89 removals,\r\nor 22.7 per cent. Precisely the same number of removals (89) has taken\r\nplace in the fourteen months which have since elapsed, but they\r\nconstitute only 7.8 per cent of the whole number of appointments (1,118)\r\nwithin that period and less than 2.6 of the entire list of officials\r\n(3,459), exclusive of the Army and Navy, which is filled by Presidential\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nI declare my approval of such legislation as may be found necessary for\r\nsupplementing the existing provisions of law in relation to political\r\nassessments.\r\n\r\nIn July last I authorized a public announcement that employees of the\r\nGovernment should regard themselves as at liberty to exercise their\r\npleasure in making or refusing to make political contributions, and that\r\ntheir action in that regard would in no manner affect their official\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\nIn this announcement I acted upon the view, which I had always maintained\r\nand still maintain, that a public officer should be as absolutely free\r\nas any other citizen to give or to withhold a contribution for the aid\r\nof the political party of his choice. It has, however, been urged, and\r\ndoubtless not without foundation in fact, that by solicitation of\r\nofficial superiors and by other modes such contributions have at times\r\nbeen obtained from persons whose only motive for giving has been the\r\nfear of what might befall them if they refused. It goes without saying\r\nthat such contributions are not voluntary, and in my judgment their\r\ncollection should be prohibited by law. A bill which will effectually\r\nsuppress them will receive my cordial approval.\r\n\r\nI hope that, however numerous and urgent may be the demands upon your\r\nattention, the interests of this District will not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe denial to its residents of the great right of suffrage in all its\r\nrelations to national, State, and municipal action imposes upon Congress\r\nthe duty of affording them the best administration which its wisdom can\r\ndevise.\r\n\r\nThe report of the District Commissioners indicates certain measures\r\nwhose adoption would seem to be very desirable. I instance in particular\r\nthose which relate to arrears of taxes, to steam railroads, and to\r\nassessments of real property.\r\n\r\nAmong the questions which have been the topic of recent debate in the\r\nhalls of Congress none are of greater gravity than those relating to the\r\nascertainment of the vote for Presidential electors and the intendment\r\nof the Constitution in its provisions for devolving Executive functions\r\nupon the Vice-President when the President suffers from inability to\r\ndischarge the powers and duties of his office.\r\n\r\nI trust that no embarrassments may result from a failure to determine\r\nthese questions before another national election.\r\n\r\nThe closing year has been replete with blessings, for which we\r\nowe to the Giver of All Good our reverent acknowledgment. For the\r\nuninterrupted harmony of our foreign relations, for the decay of\r\nsectional animosities, for the exuberance of our harvests and the\r\ntriumphs of our mining and manufacturing industries, for the prevalence\r\nof health, the spread of intelligence, and the conservation of the\r\npublic credit, for the growth of the country in all the elements of\r\nnational greatness--for these and countless other blessings we should\r\nrejoice and be glad. I trust that under the inspiration of this great\r\nprosperity our counsels may be harmonious, and that the dictates of\r\nprudence, patriotism, justice, and economy may lead to the adoption of\r\nmeasures in which the Congress and the Executive may heartily unite.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

No further information as\r\nto the possible correction therein referred to has yet reached me; but\r\nas the session of the Senate will soon terminate, I deem it advisable to\r\ntransmit the treaty as signed, in the hope that its ratification may be\r\nassented to.\r\n\r\nWhile the treaty does not contain all the provisions desired by the\r\nUnited States, the difficulties in the way of a full and complete\r\nsettlement of matters of common interest to the two countries were\r\nsuch as to make me willing to approve it as an important step toward a\r\ndesirable result, not doubting that, as time shall show the advantages\r\nof the system thus inaugurated, the Government will be able by\r\nsupplementary agreements to insert the word \"steel\" and to perfect\r\nwhat is lacking in the instrument.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 26, 1883_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, a copy of the\r\nannual report of the Government directors of the Union Pacific Railway\r\nCompany, under date of the 19th instant.\r\n\r\nThe copy of the report referred to accompanies the message to the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 1, 1883_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nHaving approved the act recently passed by Congress \"to regulate and\r\nimprove the civil service of the United States,\" I deem it my duty to\r\ncall your attention to the provision for the employment of a \"chief\r\nexaminer\" contained in the third section of the act, which was the\r\nsubject of consideration at the time of its approval.\r\n\r\nI am advised by the Attorney-General that there is great doubt whether\r\nsuch examiner is not properly an officer of the United States because of\r\nthe nature of his employment, its duration, emolument, and duties. If he\r\nbe such, the provision for his employment (which involves an appointment\r\nby the Commission) is not in conformity with section 2, Article II of\r\nthe Constitution. Assuming this to be the case, the result would be that\r\nthe appointment of the chief examiner must be deemed to be vested in the\r\nPresident, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, since in\r\nsuch case the appointment would not be otherwise provided for by law.\r\nConcurring in this opinion, I nominate Silas W. Burt, of New York, to\r\nbe chief examiner of the Civil Service Commission.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

All officials connected with any office where or for which any\r\nexamination is to take place will give the Civil Service Commission and\r\nthe chief examiner such information as may be reasonably required to\r\nenable the Commission to select competent and trustworthy examiners; and\r\nthe examinations by those selected as examiners, and the work incident\r\nthereto, will be regarded as a part of the public business to be\r\nperformed at such office.\r\n\r\n2. It shall be the duty of every executive officer promptly to inform\r\nthe Commission, in writing, of the removal or discharge from the public\r\nservice of any examiner in his office or of the inability or refusal of\r\nany such examiner to act in that capacity.\r\n\r\nRULE V.\r\n\r\nThere shall be three branches of the service classified under the\r\ncivil-service act (not including laborers or workmen or officers\r\nrequired to be confirmed by the Senate), as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Those classified in the Departments at Washington shall be designated\r\n\"The classified departmental service.\"\r\n\r\n2.

There shall be open competitive examinations for testing the fitness\r\nof applicants for admission to the service.

There shall also be competitive examinations of a suitable character\r\nto test the fitness of persons for promotion in the service.\r\n\r\nRULE VII.\r\n\r\n1.

The Commission may also order examinations of a higher grade or upon\r\nadditional or special subjects, to test the capacity and fitness which\r\nmay be needed in any special place or branch of the service.\r\n\r\nRULE VIII.\r\n\r\nNo question in any examination or proceeding by or under the Commission\r\nof examiners shall call for the expression or disclosure of any\r\npolitical or religious opinion or affiliation, nor shall any\r\ndiscrimination be made by reason thereof if known; and the Commission\r\nand its examiners shall discountenance all disclosure before either of\r\nthem of such opinion by or concerning any applicants for examination or\r\nby or concerning anyone whose name is on any register awaiting\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nRULE  IX.\r\n\r\nAll regular applications for the competitive examinations for admission\r\nto the classified service must be made on blanks in a form approved by\r\nthe Commission. All requests for such blanks and all applications for\r\nexamination must be addressed as follows: (1) If for the classified\r\ndepartmental service, to the United States Civil Service Commission,\r\nWashington, D.C.; (2) if for the classified postal service, to the\r\npostmaster under whom service is sought; (3) if for the classified\r\ncustoms service, to the head of either customs office in which service\r\nis sought. All officers receiving such applications will indorse thereon\r\nthe date of the reception thereof and transmit the same to the proper\r\nexamining board of the district or office where service is sought or,\r\nif in Washington, to the Civil Service Commission.\r\n\r\nRULE X.\r\n\r\nEvery examining board shall keep such records and such papers on file\r\nand make such reports as the Commission shall require, and any such\r\npaper or record in the charge of any examining board or any officer\r\nshall at all times be open to examination as the Commission shall\r\ndirect, and upon its request shall be forwarded to the Commission for\r\ninspection and revision.\r\n\r\nRULE XI.\r\n\r\nEvery application, in order to entitle the applicant to appear for\r\nexamination or to be examined, must state under oath the facts on the\r\nfollowing subjects: (1) Full name, residence, and post-office address;\r\n(2) citizenship; (3) age; (4) place of birth; (5) health and physical\r\ncapacity for the public service; (6) right of preference by reason\r\nof military or naval service; (7) previous employment in the public\r\nservice; (8) business or employment and residence for the previous five\r\nyears; (9) education. Such other information shall be furnished as the\r\nCommission may reasonably require touching the applicant's fitness for\r\nthe public service. The applicant must also state the number of members\r\nof his family in the public service and where employed, and must also\r\nassert that he is not disqualified under section 3 of the civil-service\r\nact, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That no person habitually using intoxicating beverages to excess shall\r\nbe appointed to or retained in any office, appointment, or employment\r\nto which the provisions of this act are applicable.\"\r\n\r\nRULE XII.\r\n\r\n1. Every regular application must be supported by proper certificates of\r\ngood moral character, health, and physical and mental capacity for doing\r\nthe public work, the certificates to be in such form and number as the\r\nregulations of the Commission shall provide; but no certificate will be\r\nreceived which is inconsistent with the tenth section of the\r\ncivil-service act.\r\n\r\n2. No one shall be entitled to be examined for admission to the\r\nclassified postal service if under 16 or over 35 years of age, or to\r\nthe classified customs service or to the classified departmental service\r\nif under 18 or over 45 years of age; but no one shall be examined for\r\nappointment to any place in the classified customs service, except\r\nthat of clerk or messenger, who is under 21 years of age; but these\r\nlimitations of age shall not apply to honorably discharged soldiers\r\nand sailors of the last war who are otherwise duly qualified.\r\n\r\nRULE XIII.\r\n\r\n1. The date of the reception of all regular applications for the\r\nclassified departmental service shall be entered of record by the\r\nCommission, and of all other regular applications by the proper\r\nexamining boards of the district or office for which they are made;\r\nand applicants, when in excess of the number that can be examined at\r\na single examination, shall be notified to appear in their order on\r\nthe respective records. But any applicants in the several States and\r\nTerritories for appointment in the classified departmental service\r\nmay be notified to appear for examination at any place at which an\r\nexamination is to be held, whether in any State or Territory or in\r\nWashington, which shall be deemed most convenient for them.\r\n\r\n2. The Commission is authorized, in aid of the apportionment among\r\nthe States and Territories, to hold examinations at places convenient\r\nfor applicants from different States and Territories, or for those\r\nexamination districts which it may designate and which the President\r\nshall approve.\r\n\r\nRULE XIV.\r\n\r\nThose examined shall be graded, and shall have their grade marked\r\nupon a register after those previously thereon, in the order of their\r\nexcellence as shown by their examination papers, except that those from\r\nthe same State or Territory may be entered upon the register together,\r\nin the order of relative excellence, to facilitate apportionment.\r\nSeparate registers may be kept of those seeking to enter any part of\r\nthe service in which special qualifications are required.\r\n\r\nRULE XV.\r\n\r\nThe Commission may give a certificate to any person examined, stating\r\nthe grade which such person attained and the proficiency in the several\r\nsubjects, shown by the markings.\r\n\r\nRULE XVI.\r\n\r\n1. Whenever any officer having the power of appointment or employment\r\nshall so request, there shall be certified to him by the Commission or\r\nthe proper examining board four names for the vacancy specified, to be\r\ntaken from those graded highest on the proper register of those in his\r\nbranch of the service and remaining eligible, regard being had to the\r\napportionment of appointments to States and Territories; and from the\r\nsaid four a selection shall be made for the vacancy.\r\n\r\n2. These certifications for the service at Washington shall be made\r\nin such order as to apportion, as nearly as may be practicable, the\r\noriginal appointments thereto among the States and Territories and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia upon the basis of population as ascertained at the\r\nlast preceding census.\r\n\r\n3. In case the request for any such certification or any law or\r\nregulation shall call for those of either sex, the four highest of that\r\nsex shall be certified; otherwise sex shall be disregarded in such\r\ncertification.\r\n\r\n4. No person upon any register shall be certified more than three times\r\nto the same officer in the customs or postal service or more than twice\r\nto any department at Washington, unless upon request of the appointing\r\nofficer; nor shall anyone remain eligible more than one year upon any\r\nregister. And no person while remaining eligible on any register shall\r\nbe admitted to a new examination of the same grade.\r\n\r\nRULE XVII.\r\n\r\n1. Every original appointment or employment in said classified service\r\nshall be for the probationary period of six months, at the end of which\r\ntime, if the conduct and capacity of the person appointed have been\r\nfound satisfactory, the probationer shall be absolutely appointed or\r\nemployed, but otherwise be deemed out of the service.\r\n\r\n2. Every officer under whom any probationer shall serve during any part\r\nof the probation provided for by these rules shall carefully observe the\r\nquality and value of the service rendered by such probationer, and shall\r\nreport to the proper appointing officer, in writing, the facts observed\r\nby him, showing the character and qualifications of such probationer and\r\nof the service performed by him; and such reports shall be preserved on\r\nfile.\r\n\r\n3. Every false statement knowingly made by any person in his application\r\nfor examination and every connivance by him at any false statement made\r\nin any certificate which may accompany his application shall be regarded\r\nas good cause for the removal or discharge of such person during his\r\nprobation.\r\n\r\nRULE XVIII.\r\n\r\nEvery head of a Department or office shall notify the Commission of the\r\nname of every person appointed to or employed in the classified service\r\nunder him (giving the date of the appointment and the designation of the\r\noffice or place) from those examined under the Commission, and shall\r\nalso inform the Commission of the date of any rejection or final\r\nappointment or employment of any probationer and of the promotion,\r\nremoval, discharge, resignation, transfer, or death of any such person\r\nafter probation.\r\n\r\nRULE XIX.\r\n\r\nThere are excepted from examination the following: (1) The confidential\r\nclerk or secretary of any head of a Department or office; (2) cashiers\r\nof collectors; (3) cashiers of postmasters; (4) superintendents of\r\nmoney-order divisions in post-offices; (5) the direct custodians of\r\nmoney for whose fidelity another officer is under official bond, but\r\nthese exceptions shall not extend to any official below the grade of\r\nassistant cashier or teller; (6) persons employed exclusively in the\r\nsecret service of the Government, or as translators or interpreters or\r\nstenographers; (7) persons whose employment is exclusively professional;\r\n(8) chief clerks, superintendents, and chiefs of divisions or bureaus.\r\nBut no person so excepted shall be either transferred, appointed, or\r\npromoted, unless to some excepted place, without an examination under\r\nthe Commission. Promotions may be made without examinations in offices\r\nwhere examinations for promotion are not now held until rules on the\r\nsubject shall be promulgated.\r\n\r\nRULE XX.\r\n\r\nIf the failure of competent persons to attend and be examined or the\r\nprevalence of contagious disease or other sufficient cause shall make it\r\nimpracticable to supply in due season for any appointment the names of\r\npersons who have passed a competitive examination, the appointment may\r\nbe made of a person who has passed a noncompetitive examination, which\r\nexamination the Commission may provide for; but its next report shall\r\ngive the reason for such resort to noncompetitive examination.\r\n\r\nRULE XXI.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Service Commission will make appropriate regulations for\r\ncarrying these rules into effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE XXII.\r\n\r\nEvery violation by any officer in the executive civil service of these\r\nrules or of the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, or fourteenth section of\r\nthe civil-service act, relating to political assessments, shall be good\r\ncause for removal.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

The general examinations under the first clause of Rule VI for\r\nadmission to the service shall be limited to the following subjects:\r\n(1) Orthography, penmanship, and copying; (2) arithmetic--fundamental\r\nrules, fractions, and percentage; (3) interest, discount, and elements\r\nof bookkeeping and of accounts; (4) elements of the English language,\r\nletter writing, and the proper construction of sentences; (5) elements\r\nof the geography, history, and government of the United States.\r\n\r\n2. Proficiency in each of these subjects shall be credited in grading\r\nthe standing of the persons examined in proportion to the value of a\r\nknowledge of such subjects in the branch or part of the service which\r\nthe applicant seeks to enter.\r\n\r\n3. No one shall be entitled to be certified for appointment whose\r\nstanding upon a just grading in the general examination shall be less\r\nthan 65 per cent of complete proficiency in the first three subjects\r\nmentioned in this rule, and that measure of proficiency shall be deemed\r\nadequate.\r\n\r\n4. But for places in which a lower degree of education will suffice the\r\nCommission may limit the examinations to less than the five subjects\r\nabove mentioned, but no person shall be certified for appointment under\r\nthis clause whose grading shall be less than an average of 65 per cent\r\non such of the first three subjects or parts thereof as the examination\r\nmay embrace.\r\n\r\n5. The Commission may also order examinations upon other subjects,\r\nof a technical or special character, to test the capacity which may be\r\nneeded in any part of the classified service which requires peculiar\r\ninformation or skill. Examinations hereunder may be competitive or\r\nnoncompetitive, and the maximum limitations of age contained in the\r\ntwelfth rule shall not apply to applicants for the same. The application\r\nfor and notice of these special examinations, the records thereof,\r\nand the certification of those found competent shall be such as the\r\nCommission may provide for. After consulting the head of any Department\r\nor office the Commission may from time to time designate, subject to the\r\napproval of the President, the positions therein for which applicants\r\nmay be required to pass this special examination.\r\n\r\nRULE VIII.\r\n\r\nNo question in any examination or proceeding by or under the Commission\r\nor examiners shall call for the expression or disclosure of any\r\npolitical or religious opinion or affiliation, and if such opinion of\r\naffiliation be known no discrimination shall be made by reason thereof\r\nby the examiners, the Commission, or the appointing power. The\r\nCommission and its examiners shall discountenance all disclosure before\r\neither of them of such opinion by or concerning any applicant for\r\nexamination or by or concerning anyone whose name is on any register\r\nawaiting appointment.\r\n\r\nRULE XI.\r\n\r\nEvery application, in order to entitle the applicant to appear for\r\nexamination or to be examined, must state under oath the facts on the\r\nfollowing subjects: (1) Full name, residence, and post-office address;\r\n(2) citizenship; (3) age; (4) place of birth; (5) health and physical\r\ncapacity for the public service; (6) right of preference by reason\r\nof military or naval service; (7) previous employment in the public\r\nservice; (8) business or employment and residence for the previous five\r\nyears; (9) education. Such other information shall be furnished as the\r\nCommission may reasonably require touching the applicant's fitness for\r\nthe public service. The applicant must also state the number of members\r\nof his family in the public service and where employed, and must also\r\nassert that he is not disqualified under section 8 of the civil-service\r\nact, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That no person habitually using intoxicating beverages to excess shall\r\nbe appointed to or retained in any office, appointment, or employment to\r\nwhich the provisions of this act are applicable.\"\r\n\r\nNo person under enlistment in the Army or Navy of the United States\r\nshall be examined under these rules.\r\n\r\nRULE XIII.\r\n\r\n1. The date of the reception of all regular applications for the\r\nclassified departmental service shall be entered of record by the\r\nCommission, and of all other regular applications by the proper\r\nexamining boards of the district or office for which they are made;\r\nand applicants, when in excess of the number that can be examined at\r\na single examination, shall, subject to the needs of apportionment,\r\nbe notified to appear in their order on the respective records.\r\nBut any applicants in the several States and Territories for appointment\r\nin the classified departmental service may be notified to appear for\r\nexamination at any place at which an examination is to be held, whether\r\nin any State or Territory or in Washington, which shall be deemed most\r\nconvenient for them.\r\n\r\n2. The Compassion is authorized, in aid of the apportionment among\r\nthe States and Territories, to hold examinations at places convenient\r\nfor applicants from different States and Territories, or for those\r\nexamination districts which it may designate and which the President\r\nshall approve.\r\n\r\nRULE XVI.\r\n\r\n1. Whenever any officer having the power of appointment or employment\r\nshall so request, there shall be certified to him by the Commission or\r\nthe proper examining board four names for the vacancy specified, to be\r\ntaken from those graded highest on the proper register of those in his\r\nbranch of the service and remaining eligible, regard being had to the\r\napportionment of appointments to States and Territories; and from the\r\nsaid four a selection shall be made for the vacancy.\r\n\r\n2. These certifications for the service at Washington shall be made\r\nin such order as to apportion, as nearly as may be practicable, the\r\noriginal appointments thereto among the States and Territories and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia upon the basis of population as ascertained at the\r\nlast preceding census.\r\n\r\n3. In case the request for any such certification or any law or\r\nregulation shall call for those of either sex, the four highest of that\r\nsex shall be certified; otherwise sex shall be disregarded in such\r\ncertification.\r\n\r\n4. No person upon any register shall be certified more than four\r\ntimes to the same officer in the customs or postal service or more\r\nthan twice to any Department at Washington, unless upon request of the\r\nappointing officer; nor shall anyone remain eligible more than one year\r\nupon any register. No person while remaining eligible on any register\r\nshall be admitted to a new examination, and no person having failed\r\nupon any examination shall within six months thereafter be admitted\r\nto another examination without the consent of the Commission; but\r\nthese restrictions shall not extend to examinations under clause 5\r\nof Rule VII.\r\n\r\nRULE XVIII.\r\n\r\nEvery head of a Department or office shall notify the Commission of the\r\nname of every person appointed to or employed in the classified service\r\nunder him (giving the date of the appointment and the designation of the\r\noffice or place) from those examined under the Commission, and shall\r\nalso inform the Commission of the date of any rejection or final\r\nappointment or employment of any probationer, and of the promotion,\r\nremoval, discharge, resignation, transfer, or death of any such person\r\nafter probation. Every head of an office in the postal or customs\r\nservice shall give such information on these subjects to the board of\r\nexaminers for his office as the regulations of the Commission may\r\nprovide for.\r\n\r\nRULE XIX.\r\n\r\nThere are excepted from examination the following: (1) The confidential\r\nclerk or secretary of any head of Department or office; (2) cashiers of\r\ncollectors; (3) cashiers of postmasters; (4) superintendents of\r\nmoney-order divisions in post-offices; (5) the direct custodians of\r\nmoney for whose fidelity another officer is under official bond, but\r\nthese exceptions shall not extend to any official below the grade of\r\nassistant cashier or teller; (6) persons employed exclusively in the\r\nsecret service of the Government, or as translators or interpreters or\r\nstenographers; (7) persons whose employment is exclusively professional;\r\n(8) chief clerks, deputy collectors, and superintendents or chiefs of\r\ndivisions or bureaus. But no person so excepted shall be either\r\ntransferred, appointed, or promoted, unless to some excepted place,\r\nwithout an examination under the Commission. Promotions may be made\r\nwithout examinations in offices where examinations for promotion are not\r\nnow held until rules on the subject shall be promulgated.\r\n\r\nApproved, November 7, 1883.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 4, 1883_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States:_\r\n\r\nAt the threshold of your deliberations I congratulate you upon the\r\nfavorable aspect of the domestic and foreign affairs of this Government.\r\n\r\nOur relations with other countries continue to be upon a friendly\r\nfooting. With the Argentine Republic, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark,\r\nHayti, Italy, Santo Domingo, and Sweden and Norway no incident has\r\noccurred which calls for special comment. The recent opening of new\r\nlines of telegraphic communication with Central America and Brazil\r\npermitted the interchange of messages of friendship with the Governments\r\nof those countries.\r\n\r\nDuring the year there have been perfected and proclaimed consular and\r\ncommercial treaties with Servia and a consular treaty with Roumania,\r\nthus extending our intercourse with the Danubian countries, while our\r\nEastern relations have been put upon a wider basis by treaties with\r\nKorea and Madagascar. The new boundary-survey treaty with Mexico, a\r\ntrade-marks convention and a supplementary treaty of extradition with\r\nSpain, and conventions extending the duration of the Franco-American\r\nClaims Commission have also been proclaimed.\r\n\r\nNotice of the termination of the fisheries articles of the treaty of\r\nWashington was duly given to the British Government, and the reciprocal\r\nprivileges and exemptions of the treaty will accordingly cease on July\r\n1, 1885. The fisheries industries, pursued by a numerous class of our\r\ncitizens on the northern coasts, both of the Atlantic and Pacific\r\noceans, are worthy of the fostering care of Congress. Whenever brought\r\ninto competition with the like industries of other countries, our\r\nfishermen, as well as our manufacturers of fishing appliances and\r\npreparers of fish products, have maintained a foremost place. I suggest\r\nthat Congress create a commission to consider the general question of\r\nour rights in the fisheries and the means of opening to our citizens,\r\nunder just and enduring conditions, the richly stocked fishing waters\r\nand sealing grounds of British North America.\r\n\r\nQuestion has arisen touching the deportation to the United States from\r\nthe British Islands, by governmental or municipal aid, of persons unable\r\nthere to gain a living and equally a burden on the community here. Such\r\nof these persons as fall under the pauper class as defined by law have\r\nbeen sent back in accordance with the provisions of our statutes. Her\r\nMajesty's Government has insisted that precautions have been taken\r\nbefore shipment to prevent these objectionable visitors from coming\r\nhither without guaranty of support by their relatives in this country.\r\nThe action of the British authorities in applying measures for relief\r\nhas, however, in so many cases proved ineffectual, and especially so\r\nin certain recent instances of needy emigrants reaching our territory\r\nthrough Canada, that a revision of our legislation upon this subject\r\nmay be deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence relative to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty has been continued\r\nand will be laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of France against the importation of prepared swine\r\nproducts from the United States has been repealed. That result is due\r\nno less to the friendly representations of this Government than to a\r\ngrowing conviction in France that the restriction was not demanded by\r\nany real danger to health.\r\n\r\nGermany still prohibits the introduction of all swine products from\r\nAmerica. I extended to the Imperial Government a friendly invitation to\r\nsend experts to the United States to inquire whether the use of those\r\nproducts was dangerous to health. This invitation was declined. I have\r\nbelieved it of such importance, however, that the exact facts should be\r\nascertained and promulgated that I have appointed a competent commission\r\nto make a thorough investigation of the subject. Its members have shown\r\ntheir public spirit by accepting their trust without pledge of\r\ncompensation, but I trust that Congress will see in the national and\r\ninternational bearings of the matter a sufficient motive for providing\r\nat least for reimbursement of such expenses as they may necessarily\r\nincur.\r\n\r\nThe coronation of the Czar at Moscow afforded to this Government an\r\noccasion for testifying its continued friendship by sending a special\r\nenvoy and a representative of the Navy to attend the ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhile there have arisen during the year no grave questions affecting the\r\nstatus in the Russian Empire of American citizens of other faith than\r\nthat held by the national church, this Government remains firm in its\r\nconviction that the rights of its citizens abroad should be in no wise\r\naffected by their religious belief.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that measures for the removal of the restrictions which\r\nnow burden our trade with Cuba and Puerto Rico are under consideration\r\nby the Spanish Government.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of Cuba to the United States and the peculiar methods of\r\nadministration which there prevail necessitate constant discussion and\r\nappeal on our part from the proceedings of the insular authorities. I\r\nregret to say that the just protests of this Government have not as yet\r\nproduced satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed to decide certain claims of our citizens\r\nagainst the Spanish Government, after the recognition of a satisfactory\r\nrule as to the validity and force of naturalization in the United\r\nStates, has finally adjourned. Some of its awards, though made more than\r\ntwo years ago, have not yet been paid. Their speedy payment is expected.\r\n\r\nClaims to a large amount which were held by the late commission to be\r\nwithout its jurisdiction have been diplomatically presented to the\r\nSpanish Government. As the action of the colonial authorities which has\r\ngiven rise to these claims was admittedly illegal, full reparation for\r\nthe injury sustained by our citizens should be no longer delayed.\r\n\r\nThe case of the _Masonic_ has not yet reached a settlement. The\r\nManila court has found that the proceedings of which this Government has\r\ncomplained were unauthorized, and it is hoped that the Government of\r\nSpain will not withhold the speedy reparation which its sense of justice\r\nshould impel it to offer for the unusual severity and unjust action of\r\nits subordinate colonial officers in the case of this vessel.\r\n\r\nThe Helvetian Confederation has proposed the inauguration of a class\r\nof international treaties for the referment to arbitration of grave\r\nquestions between nations. This Government has assented to the proposed\r\nnegotiation of such a treaty with Switzerland.\r\n\r\nUnder the treaty of Berlin liberty of conscience and civil rights\r\nare assured to all strangers in Bulgaria. As the United States have\r\nno distinct conventional relations with that country and are not a\r\nparty to the treaty, they should, in my opinion, maintain diplomatic\r\nrepresentation at Sofia for the improvement of intercourse and the\r\nproper protection of the many American citizens who resort to that\r\ncountry as missionaries and teachers. I suggest that I be given\r\nauthority to establish an agency and consulate-general at the\r\nBulgarian capital.\r\n\r\nThe United States are now participating in a revision of the tariffs of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire. They have assented to the application of a license\r\ntax to foreigners doing business in Turkey, but have opposed the\r\noppressive storage tax upon petroleum entering the ports of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Khedive has proposed that the authority of the\r\nmixed judicial tribunals in Egypt be extended so as to cover citizens of\r\nthe United States accused of crime, who are now triable before consular\r\ncourts. This Government is not indisposed to accept the change, but\r\nbelieves that its terms should be submitted for criticism to the\r\ncommission appointed to revise the whole subject.\r\n\r\nAt no time in our national history has there been more manifest need of\r\nclose and lasting relations with a neighboring state than now exists\r\nwith respect to Mexico. The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise\r\ninto that country shows, by what has already been accomplished, the vast\r\nreciprocal advantages which must attend the progress of its internal\r\ndevelopment. The treaty of commerce and navigation of 1848 has been,\r\nterminated by the Mexican Government, and in the absence of conventional\r\nengagements the rights of our citizens in Mexico now depend upon the\r\ndomestic statutes of that Republic. There have been instances of harsh\r\nenforcement of the laws against our vessels and citizens in Mexico and\r\nof denial of the diplomatic resort for their protection. The initial\r\nstep toward a better understanding has been taken in the negotiation by\r\nthe commission authorized by Congress of a treaty which is still before\r\nthe Senate awaiting its approval.\r\n\r\nThe provisions for the reciprocal crossing of the frontier by the troops\r\nin pursuit of hostile Indians have been prolonged for another year. The\r\noperations of the forces of both Governments against these savages have\r\nbeen successful, and several of their most dangerous bands have been\r\ncaptured or dispersed by the skill and valor of United States and\r\nMexican soldiers fighting in a common cause.\r\n\r\nThe convention for the resurvey of the boundary from the Rio Grande\r\nto the Pacific having been ratified and exchanged, the preliminary\r\nreconnoissance therein stipulated has been effected. It now rests with\r\nCongress to make provision for completing the survey and relocating the\r\nboundary monuments.\r\n\r\nA convention was signed with Mexico on July 13, 1882, providing for\r\nthe rehearing of the cases of Benjamin Weil and the Abra Silver Mining\r\nCompany, in whose favor awards were made by the late American and\r\nMexican Claims Commission. That convention still awaits the consent of\r\nthe Senate. Meanwhile, because of those charges of fraudulent awards\r\nwhich have made a new commission necessary, the Executive has directed\r\nthe suspension of payments of the distributive quota received from\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nOur geographical proximity to Central America and our political and\r\ncommercial relations with the States of that country justify, in my\r\njudgment, such a material increase of our consular corps as will place\r\nat each capital a consul-general.\r\n\r\nThe contest between Bolivia, Chile, and Peru has passed from the stage\r\nof strategic hostilities to that of negotiation, in which the counsels\r\nof this Government have been exercised. The demands of Chile for\r\nabsolute cession of territory have been maintained and accepted by the\r\nparty of General Iglesias to the extent of concluding a treaty of peace\r\nwith the Government of Chile in general conformity with the terms of the\r\nprotocol signed in May last between the Chilean commander and General\r\nIglesias. As a result of the conclusion of this treaty General Iglesias\r\nhas been formally recognized by Chile as President of Peru and his\r\ngovernment installed at Lima, which has been evacuated by the Chileans.\r\nA call has been issued by General Iglesias for a representative\r\nassembly, to be elected on the 13th of January, and to meet at Lima on\r\nthe 1st of March next. Meanwhile the provisional government of General\r\nIglesias has applied for recognition to the principal powers of America\r\nand Europe. When the will of the Peruvian people shall be manifested,\r\nI shall not hesitate to recognize the government approved by them.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic and naval representatives of this Government attended at\r\nCaracas the centennial celebration of the birth of the illustrious\r\nBolivar. At the same time the inauguration of the statue of Washington\r\nin the Venezuelan capital testified to the veneration in which his\r\nmemory is there held.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session authorized the Executive to propose to\r\nVenezuela a reopening of the awards of the mixed commission of Caracas.\r\nThe departure from this country of the Venezuelan minister has delayed\r\nthe opening of negotiations for reviving the commission. This Government\r\nholds that until the establishment of a treaty upon this subject the\r\nVenezuelan Government must continue to make the payments provided for\r\nin the convention of 1866.\r\n\r\nThere is ground for, believing that the dispute growing out of the\r\nunpaid obligations due from Venezuela to France will be satisfactorily\r\nadjusted. The French cabinet has proposed a basis of settlement which\r\nmeets my approval, but as it involves a recasting of the annual quotas\r\nof the foreign debt it has been deemed advisable to submit the proposal\r\nto the judgment of the cabinets of Berlin, Copenhagen, The Hague,\r\nLondon, and Madrid.\r\n\r\nAt the recent coronation of His Majesty King Kalakaua this Government\r\nwas represented both diplomatically and by the formal visit of a vessel\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nThe question of terminating or modifying the existing reciprocity treaty\r\nwith Hawaii is now before Congress. I am convinced that the charges of\r\nabuses and frauds under that treaty have been exaggerated, and I renew\r\nthe suggestion of last year's message that the treaty be modified\r\nwherever its provisions have proved onerous to legitimate trade between\r\nthe two countries. I am not disposed to favor the entire cessation of\r\nthe treaty relations which have fostered good will between the countries\r\nand contributed toward the equality of Hawaii in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the policy declared by this Government of extending our\r\nintercourse with the Eastern nations, legations have during the past\r\nyear been established in Persia, Siam, and Korea. It is probable that\r\npermanent missions of those countries will ere long be maintained in the\r\nUnited States. A special embassy from Siam is now on its way hither.\r\n\r\nTreaty relations with Korea were perfected by the exchange at Seoul,\r\non the 19th of May last, of the ratifications of the lately concluded\r\nconvention, and envoys from the King of Tah Chosen have visited this\r\ncountry and received a cordial welcome. Korea, as yet unacquainted with\r\nthe methods of Western civilization, now invites the attention of those\r\ninterested in the advancement of our foreign trade, as it needs the\r\nimplements and products which the United States are ready to supply. We\r\nseek no monopoly of its commerce and no advantages over other nations,\r\nbut as the Chosenese, in reaching for a higher civilization, have\r\nconfided in this Republic, we can not regard with indifference any\r\nencroachment on their rights.\r\n\r\nChina, by the payment of a money indemnity, has settled certain of the\r\nlong-pending claims of our citizens, and I have strong hopes that the\r\nremainder will soon be adjusted.\r\n\r\nQuestions have arisen touching the rights of American and other foreign\r\nmanufacturers in China under the provisions of treaties which permit\r\naliens to exercise their industries in that country. On this specific\r\npoint our own treaty is silent, but under the operation of the\r\nmost-favored-nation clause we have like privileges with those of other\r\npowers. While it is the duty of the Government to see that our citizens\r\nhave the full enjoyment of every benefit secured by treaty, I doubt\r\nthe expediency of leading in a movement to constrain China to admit an\r\ninterpretation which we have only an indirect treaty right to exact.\r\nThe transference to China of American capital for the employment there\r\nof Chinese labor would in effect inaugurate a competition for the\r\ncontrol of markets now supplied by our home industries.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe that the law restricting the immigration\r\nof Chinese has been violated, intentionally or otherwise, by the\r\nofficials of China upon whom is devolved the duty of certifying that the\r\nimmigrants belong to the excepted classes.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been taken to ascertain the facts incident to this\r\nsupposed infraction, and it is believed that the Government of China\r\nwill cooperate with the United States in securing the faithful\r\nobservance of the law.\r\n\r\nThe same considerations which prompted Congress at its last session to\r\nreturn to Japan the Simonoseki indemnity seem to me to require at its\r\nhands like action in respect to the Canton indemnity fund, now amounting\r\nto $300,000.\r\n\r\nThe question of the general revision of the foreign treaties of Japan\r\nhas been considered in an international conference held at Tokyo, but\r\nwithout definite result as yet. This Government is disposed to concede\r\nthe requests of Japan to determine its own tariff duties, to provide\r\nsuch proper judicial tribunals as may commend themselves to the Western\r\npowers for the trial of causes to which foreigners are parties, and to\r\nassimilate the terms and duration of its treaties to those of other\r\ncivilized states.\r\n\r\nThrough our ministers at London and at Monrovia this Government has\r\nendeavored to aid Liberia in its differences with Great Britain touching\r\nthe northwestern boundary of that Republic. There is a prospect of\r\nadjustment of the dispute by the adoption of the Mannah River as the\r\nline. This arrangement is a compromise of the conflicting territorial\r\nclaims and takes from Liberia no country over which it has maintained\r\neffective jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe rich and populous valley of the Kongo is being opened to commerce\r\nby a society called the International African Association, of which the\r\nKing of the Belgians is the president and a citizen of the United States\r\nthe chief executive officer. Large tracts of territory have been ceded\r\nto the association by native chiefs, roads have been opened, steamboats\r\nplaced on the river, and the nuclei of states established at twenty-two\r\nstations under one flag which offers freedom to commerce and prohibits\r\nthe slave trade. The objects of the society are philanthropic. It does\r\nnot aim at permanent political control, but seeks the neutrality of the\r\nvalley. The United States can not be indifferent to this work nor to the\r\ninterests of their citizens involved in it. It may become advisable for\r\nus to cooperate with other commercial powers in promoting the rights of\r\ntrade and residence in the Kongo Valley free from the interference or\r\npolitical control of any one nation.\r\n\r\nIn view of the frequency of invitations from foreign governments to\r\nparticipate in social and scientific congresses for the discussion of\r\nimportant matters of general concern, I repeat the suggestion of my last\r\nmessage that provision be made for the exercise of discretionary power\r\nby the Executive in appointing delegates to such convocations. Able\r\nspecialists are ready to serve the national interests in such capacity\r\nwithout personal profit or other compensation than the defrayment of\r\nexpenses actually incurred, and this a comparatively small annual\r\nappropriation would suffice to meet.\r\n\r\nI have alluded in my previous messages to the injurious and vexatious\r\nrestrictions suffered by our trade in the Spanish West Indies, Brazil,\r\nwhose natural outlet for its great national staple, coffee, is in and\r\nthrough the United States, imposes a heavy export duty upon that\r\nproduct. Our petroleum exports are hampered in Turkey and in other\r\nEastern ports by restrictions as to storage and by onerous taxation.\r\nFor these mischiefs adequate relief is not always afforded by\r\nreciprocity treaties like that with Hawaii or that lately negotiated\r\nwith Mexico and now awaiting the action of the Senate. Is it not\r\nadvisable to provide some measure of equitable retaliation in our\r\nrelations with governments which discriminate against our own? If, for\r\nexample, the Executive were empowered to apply to Spanish vessels and\r\ncargoes from Cuba and Puerto Rico the same rules of treatment and scale\r\nof penalties for technical faults which are applied to our vessels and\r\ncargoes in the Antilles, a resort to that course might not be barren of\r\ngood results.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury gives a full and interesting\r\nexhibit of the financial condition of the country.\r\n\r\nIt shows that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year\r\nended June 30, 1883, amounted to $398,287,581.95, whereof there was\r\nreceived--\r\n\r\n  From customs                                            $214,706,496.93\r\n  From internal revenue                                    144,720,368.98\r\n  From

assays      4,460,205.17\r\n  From other sources                                        17,333,637.60\r\n                                                           ______________\r\n      Total

basis of existing laws, the Secretary is of the\r\nopinion that for that year the receipts will exceed by $60,000,000 the\r\nordinary expenditures including the amount devoted to the sinking fund.\r\n\r\nHitherto the surplus, as rapidly as it has accumulated, has been devoted\r\nto the reduction of the national debt.\r\n\r\nAs a result the only bonds now outstanding which are redeemable at the\r\npleasure of the Government are the 3 percents, amounting to about\r\n$305,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe 4-1/2 percents, amounting to $250,000,000, and the $737,000,000 4\r\npercents are not payable until 1891 and 1907, respectively.\r\n\r\nIf the surplus shall hereafter be as large as the Treasury estimates now\r\nindicate, the 3 per cent bonds may all be redeemed at least four years\r\nbefore any of the 4-1/2 percents can be called in. The latter at the\r\nsame rate of accumulation of surplus can be paid at maturity, and the\r\nmoneys requisite for the redemption of the 4 percents will be in the\r\nTreasury many years before those obligations become payable.\r\n\r\nThere are cogent reasons, however, why the national indebtedness should\r\nnot be thus rapidly extinguished. Chief among them is the fact that only\r\nby excessive taxation is such rapidity attainable.\r\n\r\nIn a communication to the Congress at its last session I recommended\r\nthat all excise taxes be abolished except those relating to distilled\r\nspirits and that substantial reductions be also made in the revenues\r\nfrom customs. A statute has since been enacted by which the annual tax\r\nand tariff receipts of the Government have been cut down to the extent\r\nof at least fifty or sixty millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nWhile I have no doubt that still further reductions may be wisely made,\r\nI do not advise the adoption at this session of any measures for large\r\ndiminution of the national revenues. The results of the legislation of\r\nthe last session of the Congress have not as yet become sufficiently\r\napparent to justify any radical revision or sweeping modifications of\r\nexisting law.\r\n\r\nIn the interval which must elapse before the effects of the act of March\r\n3, 1883, can be definitely ascertained a portion at least of the surplus\r\nrevenues may be wisely applied to the long-neglected duty of\r\nrehabilitating our Navy and providing coast defenses for the protection\r\nof our harbors. This is a matter to which I shall again advert.\r\n\r\nImmediately associated with the financial subject just discussed is the\r\nimportant question what legislation is needed regarding the national\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate amount of bonds now on deposit in the Treasury to support\r\nthe national-bank circulation is about $350,000,000. Nearly $200,000,000\r\nof this amount consists of 3 percents, which, as already stated, are\r\npayable at the pleasure of the Government and are likely to be called in\r\nwithin less than four years unless meantime the surplus revenues shall\r\nbe diminished.\r\n\r\nThe probable effect of such an extensive retirement of the securities\r\nwhich are the basis of the national-bank circulation would be such a\r\ncontraction of the volume of the currency as to produce grave commercial\r\nembarrassments.\r\n\r\nHow can this danger be obviated? The most effectual plan, and one whose\r\nadoption at the earliest practicable opportunity I shall heartily\r\napprove, has already been indicated.\r\n\r\nIf the revenues of the next four years shall be kept substantially\r\ncommensurate with the expenses, the volume of circulation will not be\r\nlikely to suffer any material disturbance; but if, on the other hand,\r\nthere shall be great delay in reducing taxation, it will become\r\nnecessary either to substitute some other form of currency in place of\r\nthe national-bank notes or to make important changes in the laws by\r\nwhich their circulation is now controlled.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the latter course is far preferable. I commend to your\r\nattention the very interesting and thoughtful suggestions upon this\r\nsubject which appear in the Secretary's report.\r\n\r\nThe objections which he urges against the acceptance of any other\r\nsecurities than the obligations of the Government itself as a foundation\r\nfor national-bank circulation seem to me insuperable.\r\n\r\nFor averting the threatened contraction two courses have been suggested,\r\neither of which is probably feasible. One is the issuance of new bonds,\r\nhaving many years to run, bearing a low rate of interest, and\r\nexchangeable upon specified terms for those now outstanding. The other\r\ncourse, which commends itself to my own judgment as the better, is the\r\nenactment of a law repealing the tax on circulation and permitting the\r\nbanks to issue notes for an amount equal to 90 per cent of the market\r\nvalue instead of, as now, the face value of their deposited bonds. I\r\nagree with the Secretary in the belief that the adoption of this plan\r\nwould afford the necessary relief.\r\n\r\nThe trade dollar was coined for the purpose of traffic in countries\r\nwhere silver passed at its value as ascertained by its weight and\r\nfineness. It never had a legal-tender quality. Large numbers of these\r\ncoins entered, however, into the volume of our currency. By common\r\nconsent their circulation in domestic trade has now ceased, and they\r\nhave thus become a disturbing element. They should not be longer\r\npermitted to embarrass our currency system. I recommend that provision\r\nbe made for their reception by the Treasury and the mints, as bullion,\r\nat a small percentage above the current market price of silver of like\r\nfineness.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury advises a consolidation of certain of the\r\ncustoms districts of the country, and suggests that the President be\r\nvested with such power in relation thereto as is now given him in\r\nrespect to collectors of internal revenue by section 3141 of the Revised\r\nStatutes. The statistics upon this subject which are contained in his\r\nreport furnish of themselves a strong argument in defense of his views.\r\n\r\nAt the adjournment of Congress the number of internal-revenue collection\r\ndistricts was 126. By Executive order dated June 25, 1883, I directed\r\nthat certain of these districts be consolidated. The result has been a\r\nreduction of one-third their number, which at present is but 83.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of War it will be seen that in only a\r\nsingle instance has there been any disturbance of the quiet condition of\r\nour Indian tribes. A raid from Mexico into Arizona was made in March\r\nlast by a small party of Indians, which was pursued by General Crook\r\ninto the mountain regions from which it had come. It is confidently\r\nhoped that serious outbreaks will not again occur and that the Indian\r\ntribes which have for so many years disturbed the West will hereafter\r\nremain in peaceable submission.\r\n\r\nI again call your attention to the present condition of our\r\nextended seacoast, upon which are so many large cities whose wealth and\r\nimportance to the country would in time of war invite attack from modern\r\narmored ships, against which our existing defensive works could give no\r\nadequate protection. Those works were built before the introduction of\r\nmodern heavy rifled guns into maritime warfare, and if they are not put\r\nin an efficient condition we may easily be subjected to humiliation\r\nby a hostile power greatly inferior to ourselves. As germane to this\r\nsubject, I call your attention to the importance of perfecting our\r\nsubmarine-torpedo defenses. The board authorized by the last Congress\r\nto report upon the method which should be adopted for the manufacture\r\nof heavy ordnance adapted to modern warfare has visited the principal\r\niron and steel works in this country and in Europe. It is hoped that\r\nits report will soon be made, and that Congress will thereupon be\r\ndisposed to provide suitable facilities and plant for the manufacture\r\nof such guns as are now imperatively needed.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions during the past year officers of the Army have at\r\nthe request of the State authorities visited their militia encampments\r\nfor inspection of the troops. From the reports of these officers\r\nI am induced to believe that the encouragement of the State militia\r\norganizations by the National Government would be followed by very\r\ngratifying results, and would afford it in sudden emergencies the aid\r\nof a large body of volunteers educated in the performance of military\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy reports that under the authority of the acts\r\nof August 5, 1882, and March 3, 1883, the work of strengthening our Navy\r\nby the construction of modern vessels has been auspiciously begun. Three\r\ncruisers are in process of construction--the _Chicago_, of 4,500\r\ntons displacement, and the _Boston_ and _Atlanta_, each of 2,500 tons.\r\nThey are to be built of steel, with the tensile strength and ductility\r\nprescribed by law, and in the combination of speed, endurance, and\r\narmament are expected to compare favorably with the best unarmored war\r\nvessels of other nations. A fourth vessel, the _Dolphin_, is to be\r\nconstructed of similar material, and is intended to serve as a fleet\r\ndispatch boat.\r\n\r\nThe double-turreted monitors _Puritan, Amphitrite,_ and _Terror_\r\nhave been launched on the Delaware River and a contract has been made\r\nfor the supply of their machinery. A similar monitor, the _Monadnock_,\r\nhas been launched in California.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Advisory Board and the Secretary recommend the completion\r\nof the monitors, the construction of four gunboats, and also of three\r\nadditional steel vessels like the _Chicago, Boston,_ and _Dolphin_.\r\n\r\nAs an important measure of national defense, the Secretary urges also\r\nthe immediate creation of an interior coast line of waterways across the\r\npeninsula of Florida, along the coast from Florida to Hampton Roads,\r\nbetween the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River, and through Cape Cod.\r\n\r\nI feel bound to impress upon the attention of Congress the necessity of\r\ncontinued progress in, the reconstruction of the Navy. The condition of\r\nthe public Treasury, as I have already intimated, makes the present an\r\nauspicious time for putting this branch of the service in a state of\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of our policy to create and maintain a Navy able to cope\r\nwith that of the other great powers of the world.\r\n\r\nWe have no wish for foreign conquest, and the peace which we have long\r\nenjoyed is in no seeming danger of interruption.\r\n\r\nBut that our naval strength should be made adequate for the defense\r\nof our harbors, the protection of our commercial interests, and the\r\nmaintenance of our national honor is a proposition from which no\r\npatriotic citizen can withhold his assent.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General contains a gratifying exhibit of\r\nthe condition and prospects of the interesting branch of the public\r\nservice committed to his care.\r\n\r\nIt appears that on June 30, 1883, the whole number of post-offices was\r\n47,863, of which 1,632 were established during the previous fiscal year.\r\nThe number of offices operating under the system of free delivery was\r\n154.\r\n\r\nAt these latter offices the postage on local matter amounted to\r\n$4,195,230.52, a sum exceeding by $1,021,894.01 the entire cost of the\r\ncarrier service of the country.\r\n\r\nThe rate of postage on drop letters passing through these offices is now\r\nfixed by law at 2 cents per half ounce or fraction thereof. In offices\r\nwhere the carrier system has not been established the rate is only half\r\nas large.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in 1863, when free delivery was first\r\nestablished by law, the uniform single-rate postage upon local letters\r\nwas 1 cent, and so it remained until 1872, when in those cities where\r\ncarrier service was established it was increased in order to defray the\r\nexpense of such service.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the old rate may now with propriety be restored, and\r\nthat, too, even at the risk of diminishing, for a time at least, the\r\nreceipts from postage upon local letters.\r\n\r\nI can see no reason why that particular class of mail matter should\r\nbe held accountable for the entire cost of not only its own collection\r\nand delivery, but the collection and delivery of all other classes;\r\nand I am confident, after full consideration of the subject, that the\r\nreduction of rate would be followed by such a growing accession of\r\nbusiness as to occasion but slight and temporary loss to the revenues\r\nof the Post-Office. The Postmaster-General devotes much of his report\r\nto the consideration in its various aspects of the relations of the\r\nGovernment to the telegraph. Such reflection as I have been able to give\r\nto this subject since my last annual message has not led me to change\r\nthe views which I there expressed in dissenting from the recommendation\r\nof the then Postmaster-General that the Government assume the same\r\ncontrol over the telegraph which it has always exercised over the mail.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that its authority in the premises is as ample as has ever\r\nbeen claimed for it, it would not, in my judgment, be a wise use of that\r\nauthority to purchase or assume the control of existing telegraph lines,\r\nor to construct others with a view of entering into general competition\r\nwith private enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe objections which may be justly urged against either of those\r\nprojects, and indeed against any system which would require an enormous\r\nincrease in the civil-service list, do not, however, apply to some of\r\nthe plans which have lately provoked public comment and discussion. It\r\nhas been claimed, for example, that Congress might wisely authorize the\r\nPostmaster-General to contract with some private persons or corporation\r\nfor the transmission of messages, or of a certain class of messages, at\r\nspecified rates and under Government supervision. Various such schemes,\r\nof the same general nature, but widely differing in their special\r\ncharacteristics, have been suggested in the public prints, and the\r\narguments by which they have been supported and opposed have doubtless\r\nattracted your attention.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that the whole subject will be considered by you at the\r\npresent session.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of things it involves so many questions of detail that\r\nyour deliberations would probably be aided slightly, if at all, by any\r\nparticular suggestions which I might now submit.\r\n\r\nI avow my belief, however, that the Government should be authorized by\r\nlaw to exercise some sort of supervision over interstate telegraphic\r\ncommunication, and I express the hope that for attaining that end some\r\nmeasure may be devised which will receive your approbation.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General criticises in his report the provisions of existing\r\nlaw fixing the fees of jurors and witnesses in the Federal courts. These\r\nprovisions are chiefly contained in the act of February 26, 1853, though\r\nsome of them were introduced into that act from statutes which had been\r\npassed many years previous. It is manifest that such compensation as\r\nmight when these laws were enacted have been just and reasonable would\r\nin many instances be justly regarded at the present day as inadequate.\r\nI concur with the Attorney-General in the belief that the statutes\r\nshould be revised by which these fees are regulated.\r\n\r\nSo, too, should the laws which regulate the compensation of district\r\nattorneys and marshals. They should be paid wholly by salaries instead\r\nof in part by fees, as is now the case.\r\n\r\nThe change would prove to be a measure of economy and would discourage\r\nthe institution of needless and oppressive legal proceedings, which it\r\nis to be feared have in some instances been conducted for the mere sake\r\nof personal gain.\r\n\r\nMuch interesting and varied information is contained in the report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nI particularly call your attention to his presentation of certain phases\r\nof the Indian question, to his recommendations for the repeal of the\r\npreemption and timber-culture acts, and for more stringent legislation\r\nto prevent frauds under the pension laws. The statutes which prescribe\r\nthe defnitions and punishments of crimes relating to pensions could\r\ndoubtless be mads more effective by certain amendments and additions\r\nwhich are pointed out in the Secretary's report.\r\n\r\nI have previously referred to the alarming state of illiteracy in\r\ncertain portions of the country, and again submit for the consideration\r\nof Congress whether some Federal aid should not be extended to public\r\nprimary education wherever adequate provision therefor has not already\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nThe Utah Commission has submitted to the Secretary of the Interior\r\nits second annual report. As a result of its labors in supervising the\r\nrecent election in that Territory, pursuant to the act of March 22,\r\n1882, it appears that persons by that act disqualified to the number of\r\nabout 12,000, were excluded from the polls. This fact, however, affords\r\nlittle cause for congratulation, and I fear that it is far from\r\nindicating any real and substantial progress toward the extirpation of\r\npolygamy. All the members elect of the legislature are Mormons. There\r\nis grave reason to believe that they are in sympathy with the practices\r\nthat this Government is seeking to suppress, and that its efforts in\r\nthat regard will be more likely to encounter their opposition than to\r\nreceive their encouragement and support. Even if this view should\r\nhappily be erroneous, the law under which the commissioners have been\r\nacting should be made more effective by the incorporation of some such\r\nstringent amendments as they recommend, and as were included in bill\r\nNo. 2238 on the Calendar of the Senate at its last session.\r\n\r\nI am convinced, however, that polygamy has become so strongly\r\nintrenched in the Territory of Utah that it is profitless to attack\r\nit with any but the stoutest weapons which constitutional legislation\r\ncan fashion. I favor, therefore, the repeal of the act upon which the\r\nexisting government depends, the assumption by the National Legislature\r\nof the entire political control of the Territory, and the establishment\r\nof a commission with such powers and duties as shall be delegated to it\r\nby law.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture is accomplishing much in the direction\r\nof the agricultural development of the country, and the report of the\r\nCommissioner giving the results of his investigations and experiments\r\nwill be found interesting and valuable.\r\n\r\nAt his instance a convention of those interested in the cattle\r\nindustry of the country was lately held at Chicago. The prevalence of\r\npleuro-pneumonia and other contagious diseases of animals was one of the\r\nchief topics of discussion. A committee of the convention will invite\r\nyour cooperation in investigating the causes of these diseases and\r\nproviding methods for their prevention and cure.\r\n\r\nI trust that Congress will not fail at its present session to put Alaska\r\nunder the protection of law. Its people have repeatedly remonstrated\r\nagainst our neglect to afford them the maintenance and protection\r\nexpressly guaranteed by the terms of the treaty whereby that Territory\r\nwas ceded to the United States. For sixteen years they have pleaded in\r\nvain for that which they should have received without the asking.\r\n\r\nThey have no law for the collection of debts, the support of education,\r\nthe conveyance of property, the administration of estates, or the\r\nenforcement of contracts; none, indeed, for the punishment of criminals,\r\nexcept such as offend against certain customs, commerce, and navigation\r\nacts.\r\n\r\nThe resources of Alaska, especially in fur, mines, and lumber, are\r\nconsiderable in extent and capable of large development, while its\r\ngeographical situation is one of political and commercial importance.\r\n\r\nThe promptings of interest, therefore, as well as considerations of\r\nhonor and good faith, demand the immediate establishment of civil\r\ngovernment in that Territory.\r\n\r\nComplaints have lately been numerous and urgent that certain\r\ncorporations, controlling in whole or in part the facilities for the\r\ninterstate carriage of persons and merchandise over the great railroads\r\nof the country, have resorted in their dealings with the public to\r\ndivers measures unjust and oppressive in their character.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the State governments have attacked and suppressed\r\nthese evils, but in others they have been unable to afford adequate\r\nrelief because of the jurisdictional limitations which are imposed upon\r\nthem by the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe question how far the National Government may lawfully interfere in\r\nthe premises, and what, if any, supervision or control it ought to\r\nexercise, is one which merits your careful consideration.\r\n\r\nWhile we can not fail to recognize the importance of the vast railway\r\nsystems of the country and their great and beneficent influences upon\r\nthe development of our material wealth, we should, on the other hand,\r\nremember that no individual and no corporation ought to be invested\r\nwith absolute power over the interest of any other citizen or class\r\nof citizens. The right of these railway corporations to a fair and\r\nprofitable return upon their investments and to reasonable freedom in\r\ntheir regulations must be recognized; but it seems only just that, so\r\nfar as its constitutional authority will permit, Congress should protect\r\nthe people at large in their interstate traffic against acts of\r\ninjustice which the State governments are powerless to prevent.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I called attention to the necessity of\r\nprotecting by suitable legislation the forests situated upon the public\r\ndomain. In many portions of the West the pursuit of general agriculture\r\nis only made practicable by resort to irrigation, while successful\r\nirrigation would itself be impossible without the aid afforded by\r\nforests in contributing to the regularity and constancy of the supply of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year severe suffering and great loss of property have\r\nbeen occasioned by profuse floods followed by periods of unusually low\r\nwater in many of the great rivers of the country.\r\n\r\nThese irregularities were in great measure caused by the removal from\r\nabout the sources of the streams in question of the timber by which the\r\nwater supply had been nourished and protected.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of such portions of the forests on the national domain\r\nas essentially contribute to the equable flow of important water courses\r\nis of the highest consequence.\r\n\r\nImportant tributaries of the Missouri, the Columbia, and the\r\nSaskatchewan rise in the mountain region of Montana, near the northern\r\nboundary of the United States, between the Blackfeet and Flathead Indian\r\nreservations. This region is unsuitable for settlement, but upon the\r\nrivers which flow from it depends the future agricultural development\r\nof a vast tract of country. The attention of Congress is called to the\r\nnecessity of withdrawing from public sale this part of the public domain\r\nand establishing there a forest preserve.\r\n\r\nThe industrial exhibitions which have been held in the United States\r\nduring the present year attracted attention in many foreign countries,\r\nwhere the announcement of those enterprises had been made public through\r\nthe foreign agencies of this Government. The Industrial Exhibition at\r\nBoston and the Southern Exposition at Louisville were largely attended\r\nby the exhibitors of foreign countries, notwithstanding the absence of\r\nany professed national character in those undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe Centennial Exposition to be held next year at New Orleans in\r\ncommemoration of the centenary of the first shipment of cotton from\r\na port of the United States bids fair to meet with like gratifying\r\nsuccess. Under the act of Congress of the 10th of February, 1883,\r\ndeclaring that exposition to be national and international in its\r\ncharacter, all foreign governments with which the United States\r\nmaintain relations have been invited to participate.\r\n\r\nThe promoters of this important undertaking have already received\r\nassurances of the lively interest which it has excited abroad.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia is herewith\r\ntransmitted. I ask for it your careful attention, especially for those\r\nportions which relate to assessments, arrears of taxes, and increase of\r\nwater supply.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners who were appointed under the act of January 16, 1883,\r\nentitled \"An act to regulate and improve the civil service of the United\r\nStates,\" entered promptly upon the discharge of their duties.\r\n\r\nA series of rules, framed in accordance with the spirit of the statute,\r\nwas approved and promulgated by the President.\r\n\r\nIn some particulars wherein they seemed defective those rules were\r\nsubsequently amended. It will be perceived that they discountenance any\r\npolitical or religious tests for admission to those offices of the\r\npublic service to which the statute relates.\r\n\r\nThe act is limited in its original application to the classified\r\nclerkships in the several Executive Departments at Washington\r\n(numbering about 5,600) and to similar positions in customs districts\r\nand post-offices where as many as fifty persons are employed.\r\nA classification of these positions analogous to that existing in\r\nthe Washington offices was duly made before the law went into effect.\r\nEleven customs districts and twenty-three post-offices were thus\r\nbrought under the immediate operation of the statute.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Civil Service Commission which will soon be\r\nsubmitted to Congress will doubtless afford the means of a more definite\r\njudgment than I am now prepared to express as to the merits of the new\r\nsystem. I am persuaded that its effects have thus far proved beneficial.\r\nIts practical methods appear to be adequate for the ends proposed, and\r\nthere has been no serious difficulty in carrying them into effect.\r\nSince the 16th of July last no person, so far as I am aware, has been\r\nappointed to the public service in the classified portions thereof\r\nat any of the Departments, or at any of the post-offices and customs\r\ndistricts above named, except those certified by the Commission to be\r\nthe most competent on the basis of the examinations held in conformity\r\nto the rules.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the present Executive entered upon his office his\r\ndeath, removal, resignation, or inability to discharge his duties would\r\nhave left the Government without a constitutional head.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, of course, that a similar contingency may again arise\r\nunless the wisdom of Congress shall provide against its recurrence.\r\n\r\nThe Senate at its last session, after full consideration, passed an act\r\nrelating to this subject, which will now, I trust, commend itself to the\r\napproval of both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe clause of the Constitution upon which must depend any law regulating\r\nthe Presidential succession presents also for solution other questions\r\nof paramount importance.\r\n\r\nThese questions relate to the proper interpretation of the phrase\r\n\"inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office,\" our\r\norganic law providing that when the President shall suffer from such\r\ninability the Presidential office shall devolve upon the Vice-President,\r\nwho must himself under like circumstances give place to such officer as\r\nCongress may by law appoint to act as President.\r\n\r\nI need not here set forth the numerous and interesting inquiries which\r\nare suggested by these words of the Constitution. They were fully stated\r\nin my first communication to Congress and have since been the subject of\r\nfrequent deliberations in that body.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be hoped that these momentous questions will find\r\nspeedy solution, lest emergencies may arise when longer delay will be\r\nimpossible and any determination, albeit the wisest, may furnish cause\r\nfor anxiety and alarm.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons fully stated in my last annual message I repeat my\r\nrecommendation that Congress propose an amendment to that provision of\r\nthe Constitution which prescribes the formalities for the enactment of\r\nlaws, whereby, in respect to bills for the appropriation of public\r\nmoneys, the Executive may be enabled, while giving his approval to\r\nparticular items, to interpose his veto as to such others as do not\r\ncommend themselves to his judgment.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth amendment of the Constitution confers the rights of\r\ncitizenship upon all persons born or naturalized in the United States\r\nand subject to the jurisdiction thereof. It was the special purpose of\r\nthis amendment to insure to members of the colored race the full\r\nenjoyment of civil and political rights. Certain statutory provisions\r\nintended to secure the enforcement of those rights have been recently\r\ndeclared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nAny legislation whereby Congress may lawfully supplement the guaranties\r\nwhich the Constitution affords for the equal enjoyment by all the\r\ncitizens of the United States of every right, privilege, and immunity\r\nof citizenship will receive my unhesitating approval.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 8, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI submit a communication from the governor of the State of Illinois,\r\nwith a copy of an act of the general assembly of that State tendering to\r\nthe United States the cession of the Illinois and Michigan Canal upon\r\ncondition that it shall be enlarged and maintained as a national\r\nwaterway for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed cession is an element of the subject which Congress had\r\nunder consideration in directing by the act of August 2, 1882, a survey\r\nfor a canal from a point on the Illinois River at or near the town of\r\nHennepin by the most practicable route to the Mississippi River at or\r\nabove the city of Rock Island, the canal to be not less than 70 feet\r\nwide at the water line and not less than 7 feet in depth of water, and\r\nwith capacity for vessels of at least 280 tons burden; and also a survey\r\nof the Illinois and Michigan Canal and an estimate of the cost of\r\nenlarging it to the dimensions of the proposed canal between Hennepin\r\nand the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nThe surveys ordered in the above act have been completed and the report\r\nupon them is included in the last annual report of the Secretary of War,\r\nand a copy is herewith submitted. It is estimated in the report that by\r\nthe enlargement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the construction\r\nof the proposed canal by the shortest route between Hennepin and the\r\nMississippi River a direct and convenient thoroughfare for vessels of\r\n280 tons burden may be opened from the Mississippi River to Lake\r\nMichigan at a cost of $8,110,286.65, and that the annual charge for\r\nmaintenance would be $138,600.\r\n\r\nIt appears from these papers that the estimated yield of corn, wheat,\r\nand oats for 1882 in the States of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota,\r\nKansas, and Nebraska was more than 1,000,000,000 bushels. It is claimed\r\nthat if the cheap water transportation route which is now continuous\r\nfrom the Atlantic Ocean to Chicago is extended to the Upper Mississippi\r\nby such a canal a great benefit in the reduction of freight charges\r\nwould result to the people of the Upper Mississippi Valley, whose\r\nproductions I have only partly noted, not only upon their own shipments,\r\nbut upon the articles of commerce used by them, which are now taken from\r\nthe Eastern States by water only as far as Chicago.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of great interest, especially to the citizens of that part\r\nof the country, I commend the general subject to your consideration.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 8, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 7th\r\ninstant, respecting the alleged distribution of circulars in some of the\r\nDepartments asking contributions for political purposes, I hereby\r\ntransmit the reply of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 8, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the House of Representatives a communication from\r\nthe Secretary of War, submitting the annual report of the Mississippi\r\nRiver Commission.\r\n\r\nI take this occasion to invite the early attention of Congress to the\r\ncontinuation of the work on the Mississippi River which is being carried\r\non under the plans of the commission. My sense of the importance of the\r\nimprovement of this river, not only to the people of the Northwest, but\r\nespecially to the inhabitants of the Lower Mississippi Valley, has\r\nalready been expressed in a special communication to the last Congress.\r\nThe harvests of grain and cotton produced in the region bordering upon\r\nthe Mississippi are so vast as to be of national importance, and the\r\nproject now being executed for their cheap transportation should be\r\nsufficiently provided for.\r\n\r\nThe commission report that the results due to the still uncompleted\r\nworks have been remarkable, and give the highest encouragement for\r\nexpecting the ultimate success of the improvement.\r\n\r\nThe act of August 2, 1882, appropriated $4,123,000 for the work on that\r\npart of the river below Cairo. The estimates of the commission already\r\ntransmitted to Congress call for $3,000,000 for the continuation of the\r\nwork below Cairo, and it appears from their report that all of the last\r\nappropriation available for active operations has been exhausted and\r\nthat there is urgently needed an immediate appropriation of $1,000,000\r\nto continue the work without loss of time, in view of the approach of\r\nthe flood season, with its attendant dangers.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend to Congress the early passage of a separate bill\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 9, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a letter from\r\nthe Secretary of War of the 7th instant, inclosing a copy of one from\r\nthe Quartermaster-General of the Army submitting plans and estimates\r\nfor the construction of walls, etc., at the Schuylkill Arsenal,\r\nPhiladelphia, Pa., rendered necessary by the opening of Peltz street,\r\nand recommending that an appropriation be made of the amount estimated\r\nto be requisite for the work referred to.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 16, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a copy of a\r\nletter from the secretary of state of the State of Pennsylvania, dated\r\nNovember 26, 1883, inclosing a duly authenticated copy of an act\r\nof the legislature of that State entitled \"An act to provide for the\r\npreservation, use, custody, and disposition of the marine hospital at\r\nErie, and making an appropriation for the repair of the same,\" approved\r\nJuly 5, 1883, and tendering to the United States Government, on behalf\r\nof the governor, in pursuance of the provisions of the act, the said\r\nmarine hospital for use as a soldiers' and sailors' home.\r\n\r\nThe papers having upon their receipt been referred by me to the\r\nSecretary of War, I inclose also a copy of his letter of the 12th\r\ninstant returning the same, together with a copy of the report of\r\nCaptain Edward Maguire, Corps of Engineers, dated the 10th ultimo,\r\ngiving a description of the property referred to and expressing his\r\nviews as to its adaptability for a soldiers and sailors' home.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 16, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of the Interior, dated\r\nthe 11th instant, suggesting further action by Congress in the matter of\r\ngranting leases of bath houses and bath-house sites at the Hot Springs\r\nReservation, Ark.\r\n\r\nThe subject is presented for the consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 17, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of Congress, a communication from the\r\nSecretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, on the subject of an\r\nexpedition for the relief of Lieutenant A.W. Greely and his party,\r\ncomposing what is known as the \"Lady Franklin Bay Expedition,\" which was\r\nsent to the arctic regions in 1881 under the provisions of the acts of\r\nCongress approved May 1, 1880, and March 3, 1881.\r\n\r\nIn the plans for the relief of this party, as arranged with Lieutenant\r\nGreely, it was contemplated that an effort would be made to communicate\r\nwith him and furnish him any needed assistance in 1882 and again in\r\n1883.\r\n\r\nSubsequently legislation was enacted which required the expedition of\r\n1883 to bring the party home. It was a part of the arrangement that\r\nif communication should not be made with him on or before the 1st of\r\nSeptember, 1883, he should, with his party, abandon his station at\r\nLady Franklin Bay not later than the above-mentioned date and proceed\r\nsouth-ward, and would find a well-supplied relief station at the\r\nentrance to Smiths Sound, a point where it would not be difficult\r\nto reach him during a part of each year. The expeditions of 1882 and\r\n1883 were sent, but neither one of them was able to communicate with\r\nLieutenant Greely; and the last one failed to accomplish any part of\r\nits object beyond leaving a very small quantity of stores in the\r\nneighborhood of the entrance to Smiths Sound.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Lieutenant Greely and his party under these\r\ncircumstances is one of great peril, and in presenting the preliminary\r\nviews of the board appointed by me to take into consideration an\r\nexpedition for their relief I urgently recommend prompt action by\r\nCongress to enable the recommendations of the Secretary of War and the\r\nSecretary of the Navy to be carried out without delay.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

The importance of the work is well known, and as it appears\r\nthat without a speedy appropriation a delay of a year must follow,\r\naccompanied by large expenses to protect from injury the work already\r\ndone, I commend the subject to the early and favorable consideration\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 21, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State of the 21st\r\ninstant, whereby your honorable body, and through you the people of the\r\nUnited States, may become apprised of the generous contribution made by\r\nHer Britannic Majesty's Government toward the efforts for the relief of\r\nLieutenant Greely's arctic exploring party by presenting to the United\r\nStates the arctic steamship _Alert_.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _Washington, February 21, 1884_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nIn the search for vessels suitable for the expedition now preparing to\r\nrelieve Lieutenant Greely and his party, attention was early directed to\r\nthe _Alert_, which is the property of the British Government, and\r\nwas the advance ship of the expedition under Sir George Nares. It was\r\ndesirable to secure this vessel, as she is peculiarly fitted for the\r\nintended service, and as the inspecting officers recommended her Mr.\r\nLowell was therefore instructed to ask whether she could be spared for\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nInformation of the wish of this Government having previously and\r\ninformally reached the British admiralty, a private intimation was\r\nconveyed to the United States minister to the effect that the British\r\nGovernment had not forgotten the very considerate conduct of this\r\nGovernment on the occasion of the recovery of the _Resolute_, and\r\nthat should any suggestion be made that the vessel would be of use to\r\nthe expedition she would be presented. The _Resolute_, a vessel, as\r\nthe President remembers, formerly belonging to Her Majesty's navy,\r\nhaving been abandoned in the arctic region, was discovered and brought\r\nto the United States by American seamen, and thereupon was purchased by\r\nthis Government of her sailors, repaired, and returned to Great Britain.\r\nOn her arrival in England the vessel was received by the Queen in\r\nperson, and the officers of the United States Navy who took the ship\r\nthither were treated with every official and personal courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Her Majesty has now given the _Alert_ to the\r\nUnited States unconditionally, with her anchors, chains, and such of her\r\nequipment as can be utilized.\r\n\r\nRecognizing this graceful and opportune act of courtesy on the part of\r\nHer Majesty's Government, the undersigned to-day instructed Mr. Lowell\r\nas follows, by telegraph:\r\n\r\n\"Her Majesty's Government having presented to the Government of the\r\nUnited States the ship _Alert_ to aid in the relief of Lieutenant\r\nGreely and his party, you will inform the secretary of state for foreign\r\naffairs that the spirit which prompts this act of generosity, and this\r\nevidence of sympathy with the object in view, receives the highest\r\nappreciation of the President, as it will that of the people of the\r\nUnited States. The President sends his cordial thanks for the opportune\r\ngift of this vessel, which he accepts in the name of the United States,\r\nand which will be used in the humane enterprise for which it is so\r\npeculiarly adapted.\"\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nFREDK. T. FRELINGHUYSEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 21, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a letter from\r\nthe Secretary of War, dated the 19th instant, submitting a letter from\r\nthe Chief Signal Officer of the Army, dated the 2d instant, and its\r\naccompanying plan of a proposed meteorological observatory at Fort Myer,\r\nVa., together with an estimate of the cost of the same in the sum of\r\n$4,000 and a statement giving various reasons why the said observatory\r\nshould be established.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 25, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to so much of the resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nof the 17th ultimo as calls for the correspondence with the Mexican\r\nGovernment respecting the payment of claims specified in the fifth\r\nsection of the act of Congress approved June 17, 1878, I transmit\r\nherewith the report of the Secretary of State and its accompanying\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 29, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of Congress approved January 16, 1883,\r\nentitled \"An act to regulate and improve the civil service of the United\r\nStates,\" the Civil Service Commission has made to the President its\r\nfirst annual report.\r\n\r\nThat report is herewith transmitted, together with communications from\r\nthe heads of the several Executive Departments of the Government\r\nrespecting the practical workings of the law under which the Commission\r\nhas been acting.\r\n\r\nUpon the good results which that law has already accomplished I\r\ncongratulate Congress and the people, and I avow my conviction that it\r\nwill henceforth prove to be of still more signal benefit to the public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nI heartily commend the zeal and fidelity of the Commissioners and their\r\nsuggestion for further legislation, and I advise the making of such an\r\nappropriation as shall be adequate for their needs.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 29, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a report of the\r\nSecretary of State, accompanying a report made by the commission lately\r\ndesignated by me to examine and report upon the asserted unhealthfulness\r\nof the swine products of this country. The views and conclusions of the\r\ncommission deserve the most careful consideration of Congress, to the\r\nend that if any path be legitimately open for removing the prohibition\r\nwhich closes important foreign markets to those products it may be\r\nfollowed and appropriate legislation devised.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend that Congress provide for reimbursing the expenses\r\nincurred by the commissioners in this praiseworthy service, and I should\r\nbe glad also if some remunerative recognition of their public-spirited\r\naction in accepting the onerous and responsible duties imposed on them\r\nwere to suggest itself to Congress. At all events, in view of the\r\nconflicting theories touching the origin and propagation of trichiniasis\r\nand the means of isolating and extirpating it among domestic swine, and\r\nconsidering the important bearing which precise knowledge on these\r\npoints would have on the commercial aspects of the matter, I recommend\r\nprovision for special research in this direction.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 20, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of War of the\r\n18th instant, submitting a letter from Colonel A.F. Rockwell, United\r\nStates Army, in charge of public buildings and grounds, embodying an\r\nestimate in the sum of $30,000 for a pedestal for the statue of General\r\nJames A. Garfield, to be erected in the city of Washington by the\r\nSociety of the Army of the Cumberland, together with a letter upon the\r\nsubject from General Anson G. McCook, on behalf of the Society of the\r\nArmy of the Cumberland, the object in view being the procurement of an\r\nappropriation by Congress of the amount of the accompanying estimate.\r\n\r\nI commend the subject to the favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 26, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn my annual message I impressed upon Congress the necessity of\r\ncontinued progress in the reconstruction of the Navy. The\r\nrecommendations in this direction of the Secretary of the Navy and of\r\nthe Naval Advisory Board were submitted by me unaccompanied by specific\r\nexpressions of approval. I now deem it my duty to advise that\r\nappropriations be made at the present session toward designing and\r\ncommencing the construction of at least the three additional steel\r\ncruisers and the four gunboats thus recommended, the cost of which,\r\nincluding their armament, will not exceed $4,283,000, of which sum\r\none-half should be appropriated for the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe _Chicago, Boston, Atlanta,_ and _Dolphin_ have been designed\r\nand are being built with care and skill, and there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that they will prove creditable and serviceable modern cruisers.\r\nTechnical questions concerning the details of these or of additional\r\nvessels can not wisely be settled except by experts, and the Naval\r\nAdvisory Board, organized by direction of Congress under the act of\r\nAugust 5, 1882, and consisting of three line officers, a naval\r\nconstructor, and a naval engineer, selected \"with reference only to\r\ncharacter, experience, knowledge, and skill,\" and a naval architect and\r\na marine engineer from civil life \"of established reputation and\r\nstanding as experts in naval or marine construction,\" is an appropriate\r\nauthority to decide finally all such questions. I am unwilling to see\r\nthe gradual reconstruction of our naval cruisers, now happily begun in\r\nconformity with modern requirements, delayed one full year for any\r\nunsubstantial reason.\r\n\r\nWhatever conditions Congress may see fit to impose in order to secure\r\njudicious designs and honest and economical construction will be\r\nacceptable to me, but to relinquish or postpone the policy already\r\ndeliberately declared will be, in my judgment, an act of national\r\nimprudence.\r\n\r\nAppropriations should also be made without delay for finishing the four\r\ndouble-turreted monitors, the _Puritan, Amphitrite, Terror,_ and\r\n_Monadnock_, and for procuring their armament and that of the\r\n_Miantonomoh_. Their hulls are built, and their machinery is under\r\ncontract and approaching completion, except that of the _Monadnock_,\r\non the Pacific coast. This should also be built, and the armor and heavy\r\nguns of all should be procured at the earliest practicable moment.\r\n\r\nThe total amount appropriated up to this time for the four vessels is\r\n$3,546,941.41. A sum not exceeding $3,838,769.62, including $866,725\r\nfor four powerful rifled cannon and for the remainder of the ordnance\r\noutfit, will complete and equip them for service. Of the sum required,\r\nonly two millions need be appropriated for the next fiscal year. It is\r\nnot expected that one of the monitors will be a match for the heaviest\r\nbroadside ironclads which certain other Governments have constructed at\r\na cost of four or five millions each, but they will be armored vessels\r\nof an approved and useful type, presenting limited surfaces for the shot\r\nof an enemy, and possessed of such seagoing capacity and offensive power\r\nas fully to answer our immediate necessities. Their completion having\r\nbeen determined upon in the recent legislation of Congress, no time\r\nshould be lost in accomplishing the necessary object.\r\n\r\nThe Gun Foundry Board, appointed by direction of Congress, consisting\r\nof three army and three navy officers, has submitted its report, duly\r\ntransmitted on the 20th day of February, 1884, recommending that the\r\nGovernment should promote the production at private steel works of the\r\nrequired material for heavy cannon, and that two Government factories,\r\none for the Army and one for the Navy, should be established for the\r\nfabrication of guns from such material. An early consideration of the\r\nreport is recommended, together with such action as will enable the\r\nGovernment to construct its ordnance upon its own territory and so to\r\nprovide the armaments demanded by considerations which concern the\r\nnational safety and honor.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 1, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn response to a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nJanuary 15, 1884, requesting the President to forward to the House\r\ninformation, including reports from consuls and others, concerning the\r\nundervaluation, false classification, and other irregular practices\r\nin the importation of foreign merchandise, and to recommend what\r\nlegislation, if any, is needed to prevent such frauds on the revenue,\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a letter of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury of the 28th ultimo, inclosing a draft of a bill on the subject,\r\ntogether with copies of reports taken from the files of the Treasury\r\nDepartment concerning the information desired.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 1, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State and accompanying\r\npapers, furnished in response to a resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of January 16, 1884, calling for information as to the\r\npayments made by Spain in accordance with the terms of its treaty with\r\nthe United States concluded February 17, 1834.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 2, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a communication from the Secretary of War,\r\nembodying the views of the president of the Mississippi River Commission\r\nupon a report from Major Stickney, of the Engineer Corps, in relation to\r\nthe protection of existing levees from destruction by the floods in the\r\nlower part of the Mississippi River. It appears that there is an urgent\r\nneed of an appropriation of $100,000 to be used for this purpose,\r\nand that an enormous destruction of property may be thereby averted.\r\nI recommend an immediate appropriation of the sum required for the\r\npurpose, to be expended under the direction of the Mississippi River\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 2, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the House of Representatives of 5th\r\nof February last, respecting the arrest and imprisonment of certain\r\nAmerican citizens by the authorities of Colombia, at Aspinwall,\r\nI transmit a report of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 11, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nThe condition of our seacoast defenses and their armament has been\r\nbrought to the attention of Congress in my annual messages, and I now\r\nsubmit a special estimate of the Chief of Ordnance, United States\r\nArmy, transmitted by the Secretary of War, for a permanent annual\r\nappropriation of $1,500,000 to provide the necessary armament for\r\nour fortifications.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is founded upon the report of the Gun Foundry Board\r\nrecently transmitted, to which I have heretofore invited the early\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn presenting this estimate I do not think it necessary to enumerate the\r\nconsiderations which make it of the highest importance that there should\r\nbe no unnecessary delay in entering upon the work, which must be\r\ncommensurate with the public interests to be guarded, and which will\r\ntake much time.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 14, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a communication\r\nfrom the Secretary of War of the 5th instant, submitting copies of\r\ncertain papers, consisting of a letter, dated February 16 last, from Mr.\r\nHaughwout Howe, of New York City, presenting a proposition for the sale\r\nto the Government for the sum of $5,500 of certain hospital and other\r\nrecords pertaining to an association founded in New York City in April,\r\n1862, for the purpose of extending relief to soldiers of the late war;\r\na report of an examination made of these records by a representative\r\nof the War Department, and a report of the Adjutant-General stating\r\nthat the records would prove of great value to the Department in the\r\nsettlement of claims of deserving soldiers, as well as in detecting\r\nfraudulent claims, as the books, etc., contain information not now\r\nof record in the War Department.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War, it will be observed, recommends that an\r\nappropriation be made by Congress of the necessary sum for the\r\npurchase of the records referred to.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 14, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States of America:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for its consideration with a view\r\nto ratification, a convention concluded between the United States of\r\nAmerica and France and the twenty-four other powers named in said\r\nconvention for the protection of submarine cables, concluded at Paris on\r\nthe 14th day of March, A.D. 1884.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, June 9, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a letter and\r\nits accompanying estimate, submitted by the board charged with preparing\r\na departmental exhibit for the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial\r\nExposition to be held at New Orleans, beginning December 1, 1884.\r\nThis board was appointed by Executive order of May 13, 1884,[17] and\r\nis composed of representatives of the several Executive Departments,\r\nthe Department of Agriculture, and the Smithsonian Institution. It is\r\ncharged with the important and responsible duty of making arrangements\r\nfor a complete and harmonious collection of the articles and materials\r\ndeemed desirable to place on exhibition, in illustration of the\r\nresources of the country, its methods of governmental administration,\r\nand its means of offense and defense.\r\n\r\nThe board submits an estimate calling for an appropriation of\r\n$588,000 to accomplish the desired end. That amount is distributed\r\namong the Departments as shown in the table. The War, Navy, and Interior\r\nDepartments call for the largest share, representing as they do the\r\nnational defenses by land and sea, the progress of naval architecture\r\nand ordnance, the geological survey and mineral wealth of the\r\nTerritories, the treatment of the Indians, and the education of the\r\nmasses, all of which admit of varied and instructive exhibits. The\r\nSmithsonian Institution, having under its general care the National\r\nMuseum and the Fish Commission, is prepared to make a display second\r\nin interest to none of modern days. The remaining Departments can\r\npresent instructive and interesting exhibits, which will attract popular\r\nattention and convey an idea of their extensively ramified duties and of\r\nthe many points where they beneficially affect the life of the people as\r\na nation and as individuals.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit of the Government at the Centennial Exhibition held at\r\nPhiladelphia in 1876 was admitted to be one of the most attractive\r\nfeatures of that great national undertaking and a valuable addition to\r\nit. From men of intelligence and scientific attainments, at home and\r\nabroad, it received the highest encomiums, showing the interest it\r\nawakened among those whose lives are given to the improvement of the\r\nsocial and material condition of the people.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction of such a display now on a more extensive plan is\r\nrendered possible by the advancement of science and invention during\r\nthe eight years that have passed since the Philadelphia exhibit was\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nThe importance, purposes, and benefits of the New Orleans Exhibition\r\nare continental in their scope. Standing at the threshold of the almost\r\nunopened markets of Spanish and Portuguese America, New Orleans is a\r\nnatural gateway to their trade, and the exhibition offers to the people\r\nof Mexico and Central and South America an adequate knowledge of our\r\nfarming implements, metal manufactures, cotton and woolen goods, and the\r\nlike necessities of existence, in respect to which those countries are\r\neither deficient or supplied to a limited extent. The breaking down of\r\nthe barriers which still separate us from the Republics of America whose\r\nproductions so entirely complement our own will aid greatly in removing\r\nthe disparity of commercial intercourse under which less than 10 per\r\ncent of our exports go to American countries.\r\n\r\nI trust that Congress will realize the urgency of this recommendation\r\nand make its appropriation immediately available, so that the board may\r\nlose no time in undertaking the extensive preparations necessary to\r\nspread a more intimate knowledge of our Government institutions and\r\nnational resources among the people of our country and of neighboring\r\nstates in a way to command the respect due it in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 2, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of the bill entitled \"An act for the relief\r\nof Fitz John Porter,\" I herewith return it with my objections to that\r\nHouse of Congress in which it originated. Its enacting clause is in\r\nterms following:\r\n\r\n  That the President be, and he is hereby, authorized to nominate and,\r\n  by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint Fitz John\r\n  Porter, late a major-general of the United States Volunteers and a\r\n  brevet brigadier-general and colonel of the Army, to the position of\r\n  colonel in the Army of the United States, of the same grade and rank\r\n  held by him at the time of his dismissal from the Army by sentence of\r\n  court-martial promulgated January 27, 1863. * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that should this bill become a law it will create\r\na new office which can be filled by the appointment of the particular\r\nindividual whom it specifies, and can not be filled otherwise; or it\r\nmay be said with perhaps greater precision of statement that it will\r\ncreate a new office upon condition that the particular person designated\r\nshall be chosen to fill it. Such an act, as it seems to me, is either\r\nunnecessary and ineffective or it involves an encroachment by the\r\nlegislative branch of the Government upon the authority of the\r\nExecutive. As the Congress has no power under the Constitution to\r\nnominate or appoint an officer and can not lawfully impose upon the\r\nPresident the duty of nominating or appointing to office any particular\r\nindividual of its own selection, this bill, if it can fairly be\r\nconstrued as requiring the President to make the nomination and, by and\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, the appointment which it\r\nauthorizes, is in manifest violation of the Constitution. If such be\r\nnot its just interpretation, it must be regarded as a mere enactment of\r\nadvice and counsel, which lacks in the very nature of things the force\r\nof positive law and can serve no useful purpose upon the statute books.\r\n\r\nThere are other causes that deter me from giving this bill the sanction\r\nof my approval. The judgment of the court-martial by which more than\r\ntwenty years since General Fitz John Porter was tried and convicted\r\nwas pronounced by a tribunal composed of nine general officers of\r\ndistinguished character and ability. Its investigation of the charges of\r\nwhich it found the accused guilty was thorough and conscientious, and\r\nits findings and sentence were in due course of law approved by Abraham\r\nLincoln, then President of the United States. Its legal competency, its\r\njurisdiction of the accused and of the subject of the accusation, and\r\nthe substantial regularity of all of its proceedings are matters which\r\nhave never been brought into question. Its judgment, therefore, is final\r\nand conclusive in its character.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has recently declared that a\r\ncourt-martial such as this was is the organism provided by law and\r\nclothed with the duty of administering justice in this class of cases.\r\nIts judgments, when approved, rest on the same basis and are surrounded\r\nby the same considerations which give conclusiveness to the judgments of\r\nother legal tribunals, including as well the lowest as the highest. It\r\nfollows, accordingly, that when a lawfully constituted court-martial has\r\nduly declared its findings and its sentence and the same have been duly\r\napproved neither the President nor the Congress has any power to set\r\nthem aside. The existence of such power is not openly asserted, nor\r\nperhaps is it necessarily implied, in the provisions of the bill which\r\nis before me, but when its enacting clauses are read in the light of the\r\nrecitations of its preamble it will be seen that it seeks in effect the\r\npractical annulment of the findings and the sentence of a competent\r\ncourt-martial.\r\n\r\nA conclusion at variance with these findings has been reached after\r\ninvestigation by a board consisting of three officers of the Army. This\r\nboard was not created in pursuance of any statutory authority and was\r\npowerless to compel the attendance of witnesses or to pronounce a\r\njudgment which could have been lawfully enforced. The officers who\r\nconstituted it, in their report to the Secretary of War, dated March\r\n19, 1879, state that in their opinion--\r\n\r\n  Justice requires * * * such action as may be necessary to annul and set\r\n  aside the findings and sentence of the court-martial in the case of\r\n  Major-General Fitz John Porter and to restore him to the positions of\r\n  which that sentence deprived him, such restoration to take effect from\r\n  the date of his dismissal from the service.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the bill now under consideration are avowedly based\r\non the assumption that the findings of the court-martial have been\r\ndiscovered to be erroneous; but it will be borne in mind that the\r\ninvestigation which is claimed to have resulted in this discovery was\r\nmade many years after the events to which that evidence related and\r\nunder circumstances that made it impossible to reproduce the evidence\r\non which they were based.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the proposed legislation would establish a dangerous\r\nprecedent, calculated to imperil in no small measure the binding force\r\nand effect of the judgments of the various tribunals established under\r\nour Constitution and laws.\r\n\r\nI have already, in the exercise of the pardoning power with which the\r\nPresident is vested by the Constitution, remitted the continuing penalty\r\nwhich had made it impossible for Fitz John Porter to hold any office of\r\ntrust or profit under the Government of the United States; but I am\r\nunwilling to give my sanction to any legislation which shall practically\r\nannul and set at naught the solemn and deliberate conclusions of the\r\ntribunal by which he was convicted and of the President by whom its\r\nfindings were examined and approved.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas both Houses of Congress did on the 20th instant request the\r\ncommemoration, on the 23d instant, of the one hundredth anniversary of\r\nthe surrender by George Washington, at Annapolis, of his commission as\r\nCommander in Chief of the patriot forces of America; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is fitting that this memorable act, which not only signalized\r\nthe termination of the heroic struggle of seven years for independence,\r\nbut also manifested Washington's devotion to the great principle that\r\nours is a civic government of and by the people, should be generally\r\nobserved throughout the United States:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Chester A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 1, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States:_\r\n\r\nSince the close of your last session the American people, in the\r\nexercise of their highest right of suffrage, have chosen their Chief\r\nMagistrate for the four years ensuing.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that at no period in the country's history has\r\nthe long political contest which customarily precedes the day of the\r\nnational election been waged with greater fervor and intensity, it is\r\na subject of general congratulation that after the controversy at the\r\npolls was over, and while the slight preponderance by which the issue\r\nhad been determined was as yet unascertained, the public peace suffered\r\nno disturbance, but the people everywhere patiently and quietly awaited\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nNothing could more strikingly illustrate the temper of the American\r\ncitizen, his love of order, and his loyalty to law. Nothing could more\r\nsignally demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our political\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nEight years have passed since a controversy concerning the result of\r\na national election sharply called the attention of the Congress to\r\nthe necessity of providing more precise and definite regulations for\r\ncounting the electoral vote.\r\n\r\nIt is of the gravest importance that this question be solved before\r\nconflicting claims to the Presidency shall again distract the country,\r\nand I am persuaded that by the people at large any of the measures of\r\nrelief thus far proposed would be preferred to continued inaction.\r\n\r\nOur relations with all foreign powers continue to be amicable.\r\n\r\nWith Belgium a convention has been signed whereby the scope of present\r\ntreaties has been so enlarged as to secure to citizens of either country\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the other equal rights and privileges in the\r\nacquisition and alienation of property. A trade-marks treaty has also\r\nbeen concluded.\r\n\r\nThe war between Chile an4 Peru is at an end. For the arbitration of the\r\nclaims of American citizens who during its continuance suffered through\r\nthe acts of the Chilean authorities a convention will soon be\r\nnegotiated.\r\n\r\nThe state of hostilities between France and China continues to be an\r\nembarrassing feature of our Eastern relations. The Chinese Government\r\nhas promptly adjusted and paid the claims of American citizens whose\r\nproperty was destroyed in the recent riots at Canton. I renew the\r\nrecommendation of my last annual message, that the Canton indemnity fund\r\nbe returned to China.\r\n\r\nThe true interpretation of the recent treaty with that country\r\npermitting the restriction of Chinese immigration is likely to be again\r\nthe subject of your deliberations. It may be seriously questioned\r\nwhether the statute passed at the last session does not violate the\r\ntreaty rights of certain Chinese who left this country with return\r\ncertificates valid under the old law, and who now seem to be debarred\r\nfrom relanding for lack of the certificates required by the new.\r\n\r\nThe recent purchase by citizens of the United States of a large trading\r\nfleet heretofore under the Chinese flag has considerably enhanced our\r\ncommercial importance in the East. In view of the large number of\r\nvessels built or purchased by American citizens in other countries and\r\nexclusively employed in legitimate traffic between foreign ports under\r\nthe recognized protection of our flag, it might be well to provide a\r\nuniform rule for their registration and documentation, so that the\r\n_bona fide_ property rights of our citizens therein shall be duly\r\nevidenced and properly guarded.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the advice of the Senate at the last session, I recognized\r\nthe flag of the International Association of the Kongo as that of a\r\nfriendly government, avoiding in so doing any prejudgment of conflicting\r\nterritorial claims in that region. Subsequently, in execution of the\r\nexpressed wish of the Congress, I appointed a commercial agent for the\r\nKongo basin.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the rich prospective trade of the Kongo Valley has led\r\nto the general conviction that it should be open to all nations upon\r\nequal terms. At an international conference for the consideration of\r\nthis subject called by the Emperor of Germany, and now in session at\r\nBerlin, delegates are in attendance on behalf of the United States.\r\nOf the results of the conference you will be duly advised.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Korea has generously aided the efforts of the United\r\nStates minister to secure suitable premises for the use of the legation.\r\nAs the conditions of diplomatic intercourse with Eastern nations demand\r\nthat the legation premises be owned by the represented power, I advise\r\nthat an appropriation be made for the acquisition of this property by\r\nthe Government. The United States already possess valuable premises at\r\nTangier as a gift from the Sultan of Morocco. As is stated hereafter,\r\nthey have lately received a similar gift from the Siamese Government.\r\nThe Government of Japan stands ready to present to us extensive grounds\r\nat Tokyo whereon to erect a suitable building for the legation,\r\ncourt-house, and jail, and similar privileges can probably be secured\r\nin China and Persia. The owning of such premises would not only effect\r\na large saving of the present rentals, but would permit of the due\r\nassertion of extraterritorial rights in those countries, and would the\r\nbetter serve to maintain the dignity of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Congress to make appropriation for our representation at\r\nthe autonomous court of the Khedive has proved a serious embarrassment\r\nin our intercourse with Egypt; and in view of the necessary intimacy of\r\ndiplomatic relationship due to the participation of this Government\r\nas one of the treaty powers in all matters of administration there\r\naffecting the rights of foreigners, I advise the restoration of the\r\nagency and consulate-general at Cairo on its former basis. I do not\r\nconceive it to be the wish of Congress that the United States should\r\nwithdraw altogether from the honorable position they have hitherto held\r\nwith respect to the Khedive, or that citizens of this Republic residing\r\nor sojourning in Egypt should hereafter be without the aid and\r\nprotection of a competent representative.\r\n\r\nWith France the traditional cordial relationship continues. The colossal\r\nstatue of Liberty Enlightening the World, the generous gift of the\r\npeople of France, is expected to reach New York in May next. I suggest\r\nthat Congressional action be taken in recognition of the spirit which\r\nhas prompted this gift and in aid of the timely completion of the\r\npedestal upon which it is to be placed.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Germany, a country which contributes to our own some\r\nof the best elements of citizenship, continue to be cordial. The United\r\nStates have extradition treaties with several of the German States, but\r\nby reason of the confederation of those States under the imperial rule\r\nthe application of such treaties is not as uniform and comprehensive as\r\nthe interests of the two countries require. I propose, therefore, to\r\nopen negotiations for a single convention of extradition to embrace all\r\nthe territory of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt affords me pleasure to say that our intercourse with Great Britain\r\ncontinues to be of a most friendly character.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Hawaii has indicated its willingness to continue for\r\nseven years the provisions of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such\r\ncontinuance, in view of the relations of that country to the American\r\nsystem of States, should, in my judgment, be favored.\r\n\r\nThe revolution in Hayti against the established Government has\r\nterminated. While it was in progress it became necessary to enforce our\r\nneutrality laws by instituting proceedings against individuals and\r\nvessels charged with their infringement. These prosecutions were in all\r\ncases successful.\r\n\r\nMuch anxiety has lately been displayed by various European Governments,\r\nand especially by the Government of Italy, for the abolition of our\r\nimport duties upon works of art. It is well to consider whether the\r\npresent discrimination in favor of the productions of American artists\r\nabroad is not likely to result, as they themselves seem very generally\r\nto believe it may, in the practical exclusion of our painters and\r\nsculptors from the rich fields for observation, study, and labor which\r\nthey have hitherto enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThere is prospect that the long-pending revision of the foreign treaties\r\nof Japan may be concluded at a new conference to be held at Tokyo. While\r\nthis Government fully recognizes the equal and independent station of\r\nJapan in the community of nations, it would not oppose the general\r\nadoption of such terms of compromise as Japan may be disposed to offer\r\nin furtherance of a uniform policy of intercourse with Western nations.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the increasing good will between our own Government\r\nand that of Mexico has been variously manifested. The treaty of\r\ncommercial reciprocity concluded January 20, 1883, has been ratified and\r\nawaits the necessary tariff legislation of Congress to become effective.\r\nThis legislation will, I doubt not, be among the first measures to claim\r\nyour attention.\r\n\r\nA full treaty of commerce, navigation, and consular rights is much to be\r\ndesired, and such a treaty I have reason to believe that the Mexican\r\nGovernment stands ready to conclude.\r\n\r\nSome embarrassment has been occasioned by the failure of Congress at its\r\nlast session to provide means for the due execution of the treaty of\r\nJuly 29, 1882, for the resurvey of the Mexican boundary and the\r\nrelocation of boundary monuments.\r\n\r\nWith the Republic of Nicaragua a treaty has been concluded which\r\nauthorizes the construction by the United States of a canal, railway,\r\nand telegraph line across the Nicaraguan territory.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of this treaty 60 miles of the river San Juan, as well as\r\nLake Nicaragua, an inland sea 40 miles in width, are to constitute a\r\npart of the projected enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis leaves for actual canal construction 17 miles on the Pacific side\r\nand 36 miles on the Atlantic. To the United States, whose rich territory\r\non the Pacific is for the ordinary purposes of commerce practically cut\r\noff from communication by water with the Atlantic ports, the political\r\nand commercial advantages of such a project can scarcely be\r\nover-estimated.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when the treaty is laid before you the justice and\r\nliberality of its provisions will command universal approval at home and\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nThe death of our representative at Russia while at his post at St.\r\nPetersburg afforded to the Imperial Government a renewed opportunity to\r\ntestify its sympathy in a manner befitting the intimate friendliness\r\nwhich has ever marked the intercourse of the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe course of this Government in raising its representation at Bangkok\r\nto the diplomatic rank has evoked from Siam evidences of warm friendship\r\nand augurs well for our enlarged intercourse. The Siamese Government has\r\npresented to the United States a commodious mansion and grounds for the\r\noccupancy of the legation, and I suggest that by joint resolution\r\nCongress attest its appreciation of this generous gift.\r\n\r\nThis Government has more than once been called upon of late to take\r\naction in fulfillment of its international obligations toward Spain.\r\nAgitation in the island of Cuba hostile to the Spanish Crown having been\r\nfomented by persons abusing the sacred rights of hospitality which our\r\nterritory affords, the officers of this Government have been instructed\r\nto exercise vigilance to prevent infractions of our neutrality laws at\r\nKey West and at other points near the Cuban coast. I am happy to say\r\nthat in the only instance where these precautionary measures were\r\nsuccessfully eluded the offenders, when found in our territory, were\r\nsubsequently tried and convicted.\r\n\r\nThe growing need of close relationship of intercourse and traffic\r\nbetween the Spanish Antilles and their natural market in the United\r\nStates led to the adoption in January last of a commercial agreement\r\nlooking to that end. This agreement has since been superseded by a more\r\ncarefully framed and comprehensive convention, which I shall submit to\r\nthe Senate for approval. It has been the aim of this negotiation to Open\r\nsuch a favored reciprocal exchange of productions carried under the flag\r\nof either country as to make the intercourse between Cuba and Puerto\r\nRico and ourselves scarcely less intimate than the commercial movement\r\nbetween our domestic ports, and to insure a removal of the burdens on\r\nshipping in the Spanish Indies, of which in the past our shipowners and\r\nshipmasters have so often had cause to complain.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of this convention has for a time postponed the\r\nprosecution of certain claims of our citizens which were declared to be\r\nwithout the jurisdiction of the late Spanish-American Claims Commission,\r\nand which are therefore remitted to diplomatic channels for adjustment.\r\nThe speedy settlement of these claims will now be urged by this\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for a treaty of commercial reciprocity with the Dominican\r\nRepublic have been successfully concluded, and the result will shortly\r\nbe laid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nCertain questions between the United States and the Ottoman Empire\r\nstill remain unsolved. Complaints on behalf of our citizens are not\r\nsatisfactorily adjusted. The Porte has sought to withhold from our\r\ncommerce the right of favored treatment to which we are entitled by\r\nexisting conventional stipulations, and the revision of the tariffs\r\nis unaccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe final disposition of pending questions with Venezuela has not as yet\r\nbeen reached, but I have good reason to expect an early settlement which\r\nwill provide the means of reexamining the Caracas awards in conformity\r\nwith the expressed desire of Congress, and which will recognize the\r\njustice of certain claims preferred against Venezuela.\r\n\r\nThe Central and South American Commission appointed by authority of the\r\nact of July 7, 1884, will soon proceed to Mexico. It has been furnished\r\nwith instructions which will be laid before you. They contain a\r\nstatement of the general policy of the Government for enlarging its\r\ncommercial intercourse with American States. The commissioners have been\r\nactively preparing for their responsible task by holding conferences in\r\nthe principal cities with merchants and others interested in Central and\r\nSouth American trade.\r\n\r\nThe International Meridian Conference lately convened in Washington upon\r\nthe invitation of the Government of the United States was composed of\r\nrepresentatives from twenty-five nations. The conference concluded its\r\nlabors on the 1st of November, having with substantial unanimity agreed\r\nupon the meridian of Greenwich as the starting point whence longitude is\r\nto be computed through 180 degrees eastward and westward, and upon the\r\nadoption, for all purposes for which it may be found convenient, of a\r\nuniversal day which shall begin at midnight on the initial meridian and\r\nwhose hours shall be counted from zero up to twenty-four.\r\n\r\nThe formal report of the transactions of this conference will be\r\nhereafter transmitted to the Congress.\r\n\r\nThis Government is in frequent receipt of invitations from foreign\r\nstates to participate in international exhibitions, often of great\r\ninterest and importance. Occupying, as we do, an advanced position in\r\nthe world's production, and aiming to secure a profitable share for our\r\nindustries in the general competitive markets, it is a matter of serious\r\nconcern that the want of means for participation in these exhibitions\r\nshould so often exclude our producers from advantages enjoyed by those\r\nof other countries. During the past year the attention of Congress\r\nwas drawn to the formal invitations in this regard tendered by the\r\nGovernments of England, Holland, Belgium, Germany, and Austria. The\r\nExecutive has in some instances appointed honorary commissioners. This\r\nis, however, a most unsatisfactory expedient, for without some provision\r\nto meet the necessary working expenses of a commission it can effect\r\nlittle or nothing in behalf of exhibitors. An International Inventions\r\nExhibition is to be held in London next May. This will cover a field of\r\nspecial importance, in which our country holds a foremost rank; but the\r\nExecutive is at present powerless to organize a proper representation of\r\nour vast national interests in this direction.\r\n\r\nI have in several previous messages referred to this subject. It seems to\r\nme that a statute giving to the Executive general discretionary authority\r\nto accept such invitations and to appoint honorary commissioners, without\r\nsalary, and placing at the disposal of the Secretary of State a small\r\nfund for defraying their reasonable expenses, would be of great public\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nThis Government has received official notice that the revised\r\ninternational regulations for preventing collisions at sea have been\r\nadopted by all the leading maritime powers except the United States, and\r\ncame into force on the 1st of September last. For the due protection of\r\nour shipping interests the provisions of our statutes should at once be\r\nbrought into conformity with these regulations.\r\n\r\nThe question of securing to authors, composers, and artists copyright\r\nprivileges in this country in return for reciprocal rights abroad is one\r\nthat may justly challenge your attention. It is true that conventions\r\nwill be necessary for fully accomplishing this result; but until\r\nCongress shall by statute fix the extent to which foreign holders of\r\ncopyright shall be here privileged it has been deemed inadvisable to\r\nnegotiate such conventions. For this reason the United States were not\r\nrepresented at the recent conference at Berne.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the scope of the neutrality laws of the United States\r\nbe so enlarged as to cover all patent acts of hostility committed in our\r\nterritory and aimed against the peace of a friendly nation. Existing\r\nstatutes prohibit the fitting out of armed expeditions and restrict the\r\nshipment of explosives, though the enactments in the latter respect were\r\nnot framed with regard to international obligations, but simply for the\r\nprotection of passenger travel. All these statutes were intended to meet\r\nspecial emergencies that had already arisen. Other emergencies have\r\narisen since, and modern ingenuity supplies means for the organization\r\nof hostilities without open resort to armed vessels or to filibustering\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nI see no reason why overt preparations in this country for the\r\ncommission of criminal acts such as are here under consideration should\r\nnot be alike punishable whether such acts are intended to be committed\r\nin our own country or in a foreign country with which we are at peace.\r\n\r\nThe prompt and thorough treatment of this question is one which\r\nintimately concerns the national honor.\r\n\r\nOur existing naturalization laws also need revision. Those sections\r\nrelating to persons residing within the limits of the United States\r\nin 1795 and 1798 have now only a historical interest. Section 2172,\r\nrecognizing the citizenship of the children of naturalized parents, is\r\nambiguous in its terms and partly obsolete. There are special provisions\r\nof law favoring the naturalization of those who serve in the Army or in\r\nmerchant vessels, while no similar privileges are granted those who\r\nserve in the Navy or the Marine Corps.\r\n\r\n\"An uniform rule of naturalization\" such as the Constitution\r\ncontemplates should, among other things, clearly define the status\r\nof persons born within the United States subject to a foreign power\r\n(section 1992) and of minor children of fathers who have declared\r\ntheir intention to become citizens but have failed to perfect their\r\nnaturalization. It might be wise to provide for a central bureau of\r\nregistry, wherein should be filed authenticated transcripts of every\r\nrecord of naturalization in the several Federal and State courts, and to\r\nmake provision also for the vacation or cancellation of such record in\r\ncases where fraud had been practiced upon the court by the applicant\r\nhimself or where he had renounced or forfeited his acquired citizenship.\r\nA just and uniform law in this respect would strengthen the hands of the\r\nGovernment in protecting its citizens abroad and would pave the way for\r\nthe conclusion of treaties of naturalization with foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the last session effected in the diplomatic and\r\nconsular service certain changes and reductions which have been\r\nproductive of embarrassment. The population and commercial activity of\r\nour country are steadily on the increase, and are giving rise to new,\r\nvarying, and often delicate relationships with other countries. Our\r\nforeign establishment now embraces nearly double the area of operations\r\nthat it occupied twenty years ago. The confinement of such a service\r\nwithin the limits of expenditure then established is not, it seems to\r\nme, in accordance with true economy. A community of 60,000,000 people\r\nshould be adequately represented in its intercourse with foreign\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nA project for the reorganization of the consular service and for\r\nrecasting the scheme of extraterritorial jurisdiction is now before\r\nyou. If the limits of a short session will not allow of its full\r\nconsideration, I trust that you will not fail to make suitable provision\r\nfor the present needs of the service.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to define in the appropriation acts the rank of\r\neach diplomatic office to which a salary is attached. I suggest that\r\nthis course be abandoned and that it be left to the President, with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, to fix from time to time the\r\ndiplomatic grade of the representatives of this Government abroad as may\r\nseem advisable, provision being definitely made, however, as now, for\r\nthe amount of salary attached to the respective stations.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our finances and the operations of the various branches\r\nof the public service which are connected with the Treasury Department\r\nare very fully discussed in the report of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the ordinary revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1884, were:\r\n\r\n\r\n  From customs                                            $195,067,489.76\r\n  From internal revenue                                    121,586,072.51\r\n  From all other sources                                    31,866,307.65\r\n                                                           ______________\r\n    Total ordinary revenues                                348,519,869.92\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures during the same period were:\r\n\r\n  For civil expenses                                       $22,312,907.71\r\n  For foreign intercourse                                    1,260,766.37\r\n  For Indians                                                6,475,999.29\r\n  For pensions                                              55,429,228.06\r\n  For the military establishment, including river and\r\n    harbor improvements and arsenals                        39,429,603.36\r\n  For the naval establishment, including vessels,\r\n    machinery, and improvements at navy-yards               17,292,601.44\r\n  For miscellaneous expenditures, including public\r\n    buildings, light-houses, and collecting the revenue     43,939,710.00\r\n  For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia    3,407,049.62\r\n  For interest on the public debt                           54,578,378.48\r\n  For the sinking fund                                      46,790,229.50\r\n                                                           ______________\r\n    Total ordinary expenditures                            290,916,473.83\r\n                                                           ==============\r\n    Leaving a surplus of                                    57,603,396.09\r\n\r\n\r\nAs compared with the preceding fiscal year, there was a net decrease of\r\nover $21,000,000 in the amount of expenditures. The aggregate receipts\r\nwere less than those of the year previous by about $54,000,000. The\r\nfalling off in revenue from customs made up nearly $20,000,000 of this\r\ndeficiency, and about $23,000,000 of the remainder was due to the\r\ndiminished receipts from internal taxation.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary estimates the total receipts for the fiscal year which\r\nwill end June 30, 1885, at $330,000,000 and the total expenditures at\r\n$290,620,201.16, in which sum are included the interest on the debt and\r\nthe amount payable to the sinking fund. This would leave a surplus for\r\nthe entire year of about $39,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe value of exports from the United States to foreign countries during\r\nthe year ending June 30, 1884, was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Domestic merchandise                                       $724,964,852\r\n  Foreign merchandise                                          15,548,757\r\n                                                              ___________\r\n    Total merchandise                                         740,513,609\r\n  Specie                                                       67,133,383\r\n                                                              ___________\r\n    Total exports of merchandise and specie                   807,646,992\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cotton and cotton manufactures included in this statement were\r\nvalued at $208,900,415; the breadstuffs at $162,544,715; the provisions\r\nat $114,416,547, and the mineral oils at $47,103,248.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period the imports were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Merchandise                                                $667,697,693\r\n  Gold and silver                                              37,426,262\r\n                                                              ___________\r\n    Total                                                     705,123,955\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than 63 per cent of the entire value of imported merchandise\r\nconsisted of the following articles:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sugar and molasses                                         $103,884,274\r\n  Wool and woolen manufactures                                 53,542,292\r\n  Silk and its manufactures                                    49,949,128\r\n  Coffee                                                       49,686,705\r\n  Iron and steel and manufactures thereof                      41,464,599\r\n  Chemicals                                                    38,464,965\r\n  Flax, hemp, jute, and like substances,\r\n    and manufactures thereof                                   33,463,398\r\n  Cotton and manufactures of cotton                            30,454,476\r\n  Hides and skins other than fur skins                         22,350,906\r\n\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending the\r\nimmediate suspension of the coinage of silver dollars and of the\r\nissuance of silver certificates. This is a matter to which in former\r\ncommunications I have more than once invoked the attention of the\r\nNational Legislature.\r\n\r\nIt appears that annually for the past six years there have been coined,\r\nin compliance with the requirements of the act of February 28, 1878,\r\nmore than 27,000,000 silver dollars.\r\n\r\nThe number now outstanding is reported by the Secretary to be nearly\r\n185,000,000, whereof but little more than 40,000,000, or less than 22\r\nper cent, are in actual circulation. The mere existence of this fact\r\nseems to me to furnish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal of\r\nthe statute which has made such fact possible.\r\n\r\nBut there are other and graver considerations that tend in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary avows his conviction that unless this coinage and the\r\nissuance of silver certificates be suspended silver is likely at no\r\ndistant day to become our sole metallic standard. The commercial\r\ndisturbance and the impairment of national credit that would be thus\r\noccasioned can scarcely be overestimated.\r\n\r\nI hope that the Secretary's suggestions respecting the withdrawal from\r\ncirculation of the $1 and $2 notes will receive your approval. It is\r\nlikely that a considerable portion of the silver now encumbering the\r\nvaults of the Treasury might thus find its way into the currency.\r\n\r\nWhile trade dollars have ceased, for the present at least, to be an\r\nelement of active disturbance in our currency system, some provision\r\nshould be made for their surrender to the Government. In view of the\r\ncircumstances under which they were coined and of the fact that they\r\nhave never had a legal-tender quality, there should be offered for them\r\nonly a slight advance over their bullion value.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary in the course of his report considers the propriety\r\nof beautifying the designs of our subsidiary silver coins and of so\r\nincreasing their weight that they may bear their due ratio of value\r\nto the standard dollar. His conclusions in this regard are cordially\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of 1882 I recommended the abolition of all excise\r\ntaxes except those relating to distilled spirits. This recommendation\r\nis now renewed. In case these taxes shall be abolished the revenues\r\nthat will still remain to the Government will, in my opinion, not only\r\nsuffice to meet its reasonable expenditures, but will afford a surplus\r\nlarge enough to permit such tariff reduction as may seem to be advisable\r\nwhen the results of recent revenue laws and commercial treaties shall\r\nhave shown in what quarters those reductions can be most judiciously\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nOne of the gravest of the problems which appeal to the wisdom of\r\nCongress for solution is the ascertainment of the most effective means\r\nfor increasing our foreign trade and thus relieving the depression under\r\nwhich our industries are now languishing. The Secretary of the Treasury\r\nadvises that the duty of investigating this subject be intrusted in the\r\nfirst instance to a competent commission. While fully recognizing the\r\nconsiderations that may be urged against this course, I am nevertheless\r\nof the opinion that upon the whole no other would be likely to effect\r\nspeedier or better results.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the Secretary's report which concerns the condition\r\nof our shipping interests can not fail to command your attention.\r\nHe emphatically recommends that as an incentive to the investment\r\nof American capital in American steamships the Government shall, by\r\nliberal payments for mail transportation or otherwise, lend its active\r\nassistance to individual enterprise, and declares his belief that unless\r\nthat course be pursued our foreign carrying trade must remain, as it is\r\nto-day, almost exclusively in the hands of foreigners.\r\n\r\nOne phase of this subject is now especially prominent in view of\r\nthe repeal by the act of June 26, 1884, of all statutory provisions\r\narbitrarily compelling American vessels to carry the mails to and from\r\nthe United States. As it is necessary to make provision to compensate\r\nthe owners of such vessels for performing that service after April,\r\n1885, it is hoped that the whole subject will receive early\r\nconsideration that will lead to the enactment of such measures for the\r\nrevival of our merchant marine as the wisdom of Congress may devise.\r\n\r\nThe 3 per cent bonds of the Government to the amount of more than\r\n$100,000,000 have since my last annual message been redeemed by the\r\nTreasury. The bonds of that issue still outstanding amount to little\r\nover $200,000,000, about one-fourth of which will be retired through the\r\noperations of the sinking fund during the coming year. As these bonds\r\nstill constitute the chief basis for the circulation of the national\r\nbanks, the question how to avert the contraction of the currency caused\r\nby their retirement is one of constantly increasing importance.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be generally conceded that the law governing this matter\r\nexacts from the banks excessive security, and that upon their present\r\nbond deposits a larger circulation than is now allowed may be granted\r\nwith safety. I hope that the bill which passed the Senate at the last\r\nsession, permitting the issue of notes equal to the face value of the\r\ndeposited bonds, will commend itself to the approval of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIn the expenses of the War Department the Secretary reports a decrease\r\nof more than $9,000,000. Of this reduction $5,600,000 was effected in\r\nthe expenditures for rivers and harbors and $2,700,000 in expenditures\r\nfor the Quartermaster's Department.\r\n\r\nOutside of that Department the annual expenses of all the Army bureaus\r\nproper (except possibly the Ordnance Bureau) are substantially fixed\r\ncharges, which can not be materially diminished without a change in the\r\nnumerical strength of the Army. The expenditures in the Quartermaster's\r\nDepartment can readily be subjected to administrative discretion, and it\r\nis reported by the Secretary of War that as a result of exercising such\r\ndiscretion in reducing the number of draft and pack animals in the Army\r\nthe annual cost of supplying and caring for such animals is now\r\n$1,108,085.90 less than it was in 1881.\r\n\r\nThe reports of military commanders show that the last year has been\r\nnotable for its entire freedom from Indian outbreaks.\r\n\r\nIn defiance of the President's proclamation of July 1, 1884,[20] certain\r\nintruders sought to make settlements in the Indian Territory. They were\r\npromptly removed by a detachment of troops.\r\n\r\nDuring the past session of Congress a bill to provide a suitable\r\nfireproof building for the Army Medical Museum and the library of the\r\nSurgeon-General's Office received the approval of the Senate. A similar\r\nbill, reported favorably to the House of Representatives by one of its\r\ncommittees, is still pending before that body. It is hoped that during\r\nthe coming session the measure may become a law, and that thereafter\r\nimmediate steps may be taken to secure a place of safe deposit for these\r\nvaluable collections, now in a state of insecurity.\r\n\r\nThe funds with which the works for the improvement of rivers and\r\nharbors were prosecuted during the past year were derived from the\r\nappropriations of the act of August 2, 1882, together with such few\r\nbalances as were on hand from previous appropriations. The balance in\r\nthe Treasury subject to requisition July 1, 1883, was $10,021,649.55.\r\nThe amount appropriated during the fiscal year 1884 was $1,319,634.62,\r\nand the amount drawn from the Treasury during the fiscal year was\r\n$8,228,703.54, leaving a balance of $3,112,580.63 in the Treasury\r\nsubject to requisition July 1, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War submits the report of the Chief of Engineers\r\nas to the practicability of protecting our important cities on the\r\nseaboard by fortifications and other defenses able to repel modern\r\nmethods of attack. The time has now come when such defenses can be\r\nprepared with confidence that they will not prove abortive, and when\r\nthe possible result of delay in making such preparation is seriously\r\nconsidered delay seems inexcusable. For the most important cities--those\r\nwhose destruction or capture would be a national humiliation--adequate\r\ndefenses, inclusive of guns, may be made by the gradual expenditure of\r\n$60,000,000--a sum much less than a victorious enemy could levy as a\r\ncontribution. An appropriation of about one-tenth of that amount is\r\nasked to begin the work, and I concur with the Secretary of War in\r\nurging that it be granted.\r\n\r\nThe War Department is proceeding with the conversion of 10-inch\r\nsmoothbore guns into 8-inch rifles by lining the former with tubes of\r\nforged steel or of coil wrought iron. Fifty guns will be thus converted\r\nwithin the year. This, however, does not obviate the necessity of\r\nproviding means for the construction of guns of the highest power both\r\nfor the purposes of coast defense and for the armament of war vessels.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Gun Foundry Board, appointed April 2, 1883, in\r\npursuance of the act of March 3, 1883, was transmitted to Congress in\r\na special message of February 18, 1884.[21] In my message of March 26,\r\n1884,[22] I called attention to the recommendation of the board that the\r\nGovernment should encourage the production at private steel works of the\r\nrequired material for heavy cannon, and that two Government factories,\r\none for the Army and one for the Navy, should be established for the\r\nfabrication of guns from such material. No action having been taken,\r\nthe board was subsequently reconverted to determine more fully the plans\r\nand estimates necessary for carrying out its recommendation. It has\r\nreceived information which indicates that there are responsible steel\r\nmanufacturers in this country who, although not provided at present\r\nwith the necessary plant, are willing to construct the same and to make\r\nbids for contracts with the Government for the supply of the requisite\r\nmaterial for the heaviest guns adapted to modern warfare if a guaranteed\r\norder of sufficient magnitude, accompanied by a positive appropriation\r\nextending over a series of years, shall be made by Congress. All doubts\r\nas to the feasibility of the plan being thus removed, I renew my\r\nrecommendation that such action be taken by Congress as will enable the\r\nGovernment to construct its own ordnance upon its own territory, and so\r\nto provide the armaments demanded by considerations of national safety\r\nand honor.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the progress which has\r\nbeen made on the new steel cruisers authorized by the acts of August 5,\r\n1882, and March 3, 1883. Of the four vessels under contract, one, the\r\n_Chicago_, of 4,500 tons, is more than half finished; the _Atlanta_,\r\nof 3,000 tons, has been successfully launched, and her machinery is now\r\nfitting; the _Boston_, also of 3,000 tons, is ready for launching, and\r\nthe _Dolphin_, a dispatch steamer of 1,500 tons, is ready for delivery.\r\n\r\nCertain adverse criticisms upon the designs of these cruisers are\r\ndiscussed by the Secretary, who insists that the correctness of the\r\nconclusions reached by the Advisory Board and by the Department has been\r\ndemonstrated by recent developments in shipbuilding abroad.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of the double-turreted monitors _Puritan, Terror,_\r\nand _Amphitrite_, contracted for under the act of March 3, 1883, is\r\nin process of construction. No work has been done during the past year\r\non their armor for lack of the necessary appropriations. A fourth\r\nmonitor, the _Monadnock_, still remains unfinished at the navy-yard\r\nin California. It is recommended that early steps be taken to complete\r\nthese vessels and to provide also an armament for the monitor\r\n_Miantonomoh_.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Naval Advisory Board, approved by the\r\nDepartment, comprise the construction of one steel cruiser of 4,500\r\ntons, one cruiser of 3,000 tons, two heavily armed gunboats, one light\r\ncruising gunboat, one dispatch vessel armed with Hotchkiss cannon, one\r\narmored ram, and three torpedo boats. The general designs, all of which\r\nare calculated to meet the existing wants of the service, are now well\r\nadvanced, and the construction of the vessels can be undertaken as soon\r\nas you shall grant the necessary authority.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress approved August 7, 1882, authorized the removal to\r\nthe United States of the bodies of Lieutenant-Commander George W. De\r\nLong and his companions of the _Jeannette_ expedition. This removal\r\nhas been successfully accomplished by Lieutenants Harber and Schuetze.\r\nThe remains were taken from their grave in the Lena Delta in March,\r\n1883, and were retained at Yakutsk until the following winter, the\r\nseason being too far advanced to admit of their immediate\r\ntransportation. They arrived at New York February 20, 1884, where they\r\nwere received with suitable honors.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the joint resolution of Congress approved February 13,\r\n1884, a naval expedition was fitted out for the relief of Lieutenant\r\nA.W. Greely, United States Army, and of the party who had been engaged\r\nunder his command in scientific observations at Lady Franklin Bay. The\r\nfleet consisted of the steam sealer _Thetis_, purchased in England;\r\n_Bear_, purchased at St. Johns, Newfoundland, and the _Alert_,\r\nwhich was generously provided by the British Government. Preparations\r\nfor the expedition were promptly made by the Secretary of the Navy, with\r\nthe active cooperation of the Secretary of War. Commander George W.\r\nCoffin was placed in command of the _Alert_ and Lieutenant William\r\nH. Emory in command of the _Bear_. The _Thetis_ was intrusted\r\nto Commander Winfield S. Schley, to whom also was assigned the\r\nsuperintendence of the entire expedition.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon its arrival at Upernavik the fleet began the\r\ndangerous navigation of Melville Bay, and in spite of every obstacle\r\nreached Littleton Island on June 22, a fortnight earlier than any vessel\r\nhad before attained that point. On the same day it crossed over to Cape\r\nSabine, where Lieutenant Greely and the other survivors of his party\r\nwere discovered. After taking on board the living and the bodies of the\r\ndead, the relief ships sailed for St. Johns, where they arrived on July\r\n17. They were appropriately received at Portsmouth, N.H., on August 1\r\nand at New York on August 8. One of the bodies was landed at the former\r\nplace. The others were put on shore at Governors Island, and, with\r\nthe exception of one, which was interred in the national cemetery,\r\nwere forwarded thence to the destinations indicated by friends.\r\nThe organization and conduct of this relief expedition reflects great\r\ncredit upon all who contributed to its success.\r\n\r\nIn this the last of the stated messages that I shall have the honor to\r\ntransmit to the Congress of the United States I can not too strongly\r\nurge upon its attention the duty of restoring our Navy as rapidly as\r\npossible to the high state of efficiency which formerly characterized\r\nit. As the long peace that has lulled us into a sense of fancied\r\nsecurity may at any time be disturbed, it is plain that the policy of\r\nstrengthening this arm of the service is dictated by considerations of\r\nwise economy, of just regard for our future tranquillity, and of true\r\nappreciation of the dignity and honor of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General acquaints you with the present\r\ncondition and needs of the postal service.\r\n\r\nIt discloses the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from the\r\nreduction in the rate of letter postage recommended in my message of\r\nDecember 4, 1882, and effected by the act of March 3, 1883, has been\r\nmuch less than was generally anticipated. My recommendation of this\r\nreduction was based upon the belief that the actual falling off in\r\nreceipts from letter postages for the year immediately succeeding the\r\nchange of rate would be $3,000,000. It has proved to be only $2,275,000.\r\n\r\nThis is a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restored\r\nto its former volume by the natural increase of sealed correspondence.\r\n\r\nI confidently repeat, therefore, the recommendation of my last annual\r\nmessage that the single-rate postage upon drop letters be reduced to\r\n1 cent wherever the payment of 2 cents is now required by law. The\r\ndouble rate is only exacted at offices where the carrier system is in\r\noperation, and it appears that at those offices the increase in the tax\r\nupon local letters defrays the cost not only of its own collection and\r\ndelivery, but of the collection and delivery of all other mail matter.\r\nThis is an inequality that ought no longer to exist.\r\n\r\nI approve the recommendation of the Postmaster-General that the unit of\r\nweight in the rating of first-class matter should be 1 ounce instead of\r\none-half ounce, as it now is. In view of the statistics furnished by the\r\nDepartment, it may well be doubted whether the change would result in\r\nany loss of revenue. That it would greatly promote the convenience of\r\nthe public is beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nThe free-delivery system has been lately applied to five cities, and\r\nthe total number of offices in which it is now in operation is 159.\r\nExperience shows that its adoption, under proper conditions, is equally\r\nan accommodation to the public and an advantage to the postal service.\r\nIt is more than self-sustaining, and for the reasons urged by the\r\nPostmaster-General may properly be extended.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of that officer it is important to provide means whereby\r\nexceptional dispatch in dealing with letters in free-delivery offices\r\nmay be secured by payment of extraordinary postage. This scheme might\r\nbe made effective by employment of a special stamp whose cost should\r\nbe commensurate with the expense of the extra service.\r\n\r\nIn some of the large cities private express companies have undertaken\r\nto outstrip the Government mail carriers by affording for the prompt\r\ntransmission of letters better facilities than have hitherto been at the\r\ncommand of the Post-Office.\r\n\r\nIt has always been the policy of the Government to discourage such\r\nenterprises, and in no better mode can that policy be maintained than in\r\nsupplying the public with the most efficient mail service that, with due\r\nregard to its own best interests, can be furnished for its\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General renews the recommendation contained in his report\r\nof last year touching the fees of witnesses and jurors.\r\n\r\nHe favors radical changes in the fee bill, the adoption of a system by\r\nwhich attorneys and marshals of the United States shall be compensated\r\nsolely by salaries, and the erection by the Government of a penitentiary\r\nfor the confinement of offenders against its laws.\r\n\r\nOf the varied governmental concerns in charge of the Interior Department\r\nthe report of its Secretary presents an interesting summary. Among the\r\ntopics deserving particular attention I refer you to his observations\r\nrespecting our Indian affairs, the preemption and timber-culture acts,\r\nthe failure of railroad companies to take title to lands granted by the\r\nGovernment, and the operations of the Pension Office, the Patent Office,\r\nthe Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Education.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made already to the circumstance that, both as between\r\nthe different Indian tribes and as between the Indians and the whites,\r\nthe past year has been one of unbroken peace.\r\n\r\nIn this circumstance the President is glad to find justification for the\r\npolicy of the Government in its dealing with the Indian question and\r\nconfirmation of the views which were fully expressed in his first\r\ncommunication to the Forty-seventh Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary urges anew the enactment of a statute for the punishment\r\nof crimes committed on the Indian reservations, and recommends the\r\npassage of the bill now pending in the House of Representatives for the\r\npurchase of a tract of 18,000 square miles from the Sioux Reservation.\r\nBoth these measures are worthy of approval.\r\n\r\nI concur with him also in advising the repeal of the preemption law, the\r\nenactment of statutes resolving the present legal complications touching\r\nlapsed grants to railroad companies, and the funding of the debt of the\r\nseveral Pacific railroads under such guaranty as shall effectually\r\nsecure its ultimate payment.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Utah Commission will be read with interest.\r\n\r\nIt discloses the results of recent legislation looking to the prevention\r\nand punishment of polygamy in that Territory. I still believe that if\r\nthat abominable practice can be suppressed by law it can only be by the\r\nmost radical legislation consistent with the restraints of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nI again recommend, therefore, that Congress assume absolute political\r\ncontrol of the Territory of Utah and provide for the appointment of\r\ncommissioners with such governmental powers as in its judgment may\r\njustly and wisely be put into their hands.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this communication reference has more than once been\r\nmade to the policy of this Government as regards the extension of our\r\nforeign trade. It seems proper to declare the general principles that\r\nshould, in my opinion, underlie our national efforts in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe main conditions of the problem may be thus stated:\r\n\r\nWe are a people apt in mechanical pursuits and fertile in invention.\r\nWe cover a vast extent of territory rich in agricultural products and\r\nin nearly all the raw materials necessary for successful manufacture.\r\nWe have a system of productive establishments more than sufficient to\r\nsupply our own demands. The wages of labor are nowhere else so great.\r\nThe scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure\r\ntheir personal comfort and the development of those higher moral and\r\nintellectual qualities that go to the making of good citizens. Our\r\nsystem of tax and tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in\r\nexcess of the present needs of the Government.\r\n\r\nThese are the elements from which it is sought to devise a scheme by\r\nwhich, without unfavorably changing the condition of the workingman, our\r\nmerchant marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new\r\nmarkets provided for the sale beyond our borders of the manifold fruits\r\nof our industrial enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe problem is complex and can be solved by no single measure of\r\ninnovation or reform.\r\n\r\nThe countries of the American continent and the adjacent islands are for\r\nthe United States the natural marts of supply and demand. It is from\r\nthem that we should obtain what we do not produce or do not produce in\r\nsufficiency, and it is to them that the surplus productions of our\r\nfields, our mills, and our workshops should flow, under conditions that\r\nwill equalize or favor them in comparison with foreign competition.\r\n\r\nFour paths of policy seem to point to this end:\r\n\r\nFirst. A series of reciprocal commercial treaties with the countries of\r\nAmerica which shall foster between us and them an unhampered movement of\r\ntrade. The conditions of these treaties should be the free admission of\r\nsuch merchandise as this country does not produce, in return for the\r\nadmission free or under a favored scheme of duties of our own products,\r\nthe benefits of such exchange to apply only to goods carried under the\r\nflag of the parties to the contract; the removal on both sides from the\r\nvessels so privileged of all tonnage dues and national imposts, so that\r\nthose vessels may ply unhindered between our ports and those of the\r\nother contracting parties, though without infringing on the reserved\r\nhome coasting trade; the removal or reduction of burdens on the exported\r\nproducts of those countries coming within the benefits of the treaties,\r\nand the avoidance of the technical restrictions and penalties by which\r\nour intercourse with those countries is at present hampered.\r\n\r\nSecondly. The establishment of the consular service of the United States\r\non a salaried footing, thus permitting the relinquishment of consular\r\nfees not only as respects vessels under the national flag, but also as\r\nrespects vessels of the treaty nations carrying goods entitled to the\r\nbenefits of the treaties.\r\n\r\nThirdly. The enactment of measures to favor the construction and\r\nmaintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nFourthly. The establishment of an uniform currency basis for the\r\ncountries of America, so that the coined products of our mines may\r\ncirculate on equal terms throughout the whole system of commonwealths.\r\nThis would require a monetary union of America, whereby the output of\r\nthe bullion-producing countries and the circulation of those which\r\nyield neither gold nor silver could be adjusted in conformity with\r\nthe population, wealth, and commercial needs of each. As many of the\r\ncountries furnish no bullion to the common stock, the surplus production\r\nof our mines and mints might thus be utilized and a step taken toward\r\nthe general remonetization of silver.\r\n\r\nTo the accomplishment of these ends, so far as they can be attained\r\nby separate treaties, the negotiations already concluded and now in\r\nprogress have been directed; and the favor which this enlarged policy\r\nhas thus far received warrants the belief that its operations will ere\r\nlong embrace all, or nearly all, the countries of this hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means desirable, however, that the policy under\r\nconsideration should be applied to these countries alone. The healthful\r\nenlargement of our trade with Europe, Asia, and Africa should be sought\r\nby reducing tariff burdens on such of their wares as neither we nor the\r\nother American States are fitted to produce, and thus enabling ourselves\r\nto obtain in return a better market for our supplies of food, of raw\r\nmaterials, and of the manufactures in which we excel.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that many of the embarrassing elements in the great\r\nnational conflict between protection and free trade may thus be turned\r\nto good account; that the revenue may be reduced so as no longer to\r\novertax the people; that protective duties may be retained without\r\nbecoming burdensome; that our shipping interests may be judiciously\r\nencouraged, the currency fixed on firm bases, and, above all, such an\r\nunity of interests established among the States of the American system\r\nas will be of great and ever-increasing advantage to them all.\r\n\r\nAll treaties in the line of this policy which have been negotiated\r\nor are in process of negotiation contain a provision deemed to be\r\nrequisite under the clause of the Constitution limiting to the House of\r\nRepresentatives the authority to originate bills for raising revenue.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of February last[23] I transmitted to the Congress the\r\nfirst annual report of the Civil Service Commission, together with\r\ncommunications from the heads of the several Executive Departments of\r\nthe Government respecting the practical workings of the law under which\r\nthe Commission had been acting. The good results therein foreshadowed\r\nhave been more than realized.\r\n\r\nThe system has fully answered the expectations of its friends in\r\nsecuring competent and faithful public servants and in protecting the\r\nappointing officers of the Government from the pressure of personal\r\nimportunity and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions\r\nof rival candidates for public employment.\r\n\r\nThe law has had the unqualified support of the President and of the\r\nheads of the several Departments, and the members of the Commission have\r\nperformed their duties with zeal and fidelity. Their report will shortly\r\nbe submitted, and will be accompanied by such recommendations for\r\nenlarging the scope of the existing statute as shall commend themselves\r\nto the Executive and the Commissioners charged with its administration.\r\n\r\nIn view of the general and persistent demand throughout the commercial\r\ncommunity for a national bankrupt law, I hope that the differences of\r\nsentiment which have hitherto prevented its enactment may not outlast\r\nthe present session.\r\n\r\nThe pestilence which for the past two years has been raging in the\r\ncountries of the East recently made its appearance in European ports\r\nwith which we are in constant communication.\r\n\r\nThe then Secretary of the Treasury, in pursuance of a proclamation of\r\nthe President,[24] issued certain regulations restricting and for a\r\ntime prohibiting the importation of rags and the admission of baggage\r\nof immigrants and of travelers arriving from infected quarters. Lest\r\nthis course may have been without strict warrant of law, I approve the\r\nrecommendation of the present Secretary that the Congress take action\r\nin the premises, and I also recommend the immediate adoption of such\r\nmeasures as will be likely to ward off the dreaded epidemic and to\r\nmitigate its severity in case it shall unhappily extend to our shores.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia\r\nreviews the operations of the several departments of its municipal\r\ngovernment. I ask your careful consideration of its suggestions in\r\nrespect to legislation, especially commending such as relate to a\r\nrevision of the civil and criminal code, the performance of labor by\r\npersons sentenced to imprisonment in the jail, the construction and\r\noccupation of wharves along the river front, and the erection of a\r\nsuitable building for District offices.\r\n\r\nI recommend that in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses\r\nS. Grant, late General of the armies of the United States and twice\r\nPresident of this nation, the Congress confer upon him a suitable\r\npension.\r\n\r\nCertain of the measures that seem to me necessary and expedient I have\r\nnow, in obedience to the Constitution, recommended for your adoption.\r\n\r\nAs respects others of no less importance I shall content myself with\r\nrenewing the recommendations already made to the Congress, without\r\nrestating the grounds upon which such recommendations were based.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of forests on the public domain, the granting of\r\nGovernment aid for popular education, the amendment of the Federal\r\nConstitution so as to make effective the disapproval by the President of\r\nparticular items in appropriation bills, the enactment of statutes in\r\nregard to the filling of vacancies in the Presidential office, and the\r\ndetermining of vexed questions respecting Presidential inability are\r\nmeasures which may justly receive your serious consideration.\r\n\r\nAs the time draws nigh when I am to retire from the public service,\r\nI can not refrain from expressing to the members of the National\r\nLegislature with whom I have been brought into personal and official\r\nintercourse my sincere appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and of\r\ntheir harmonious cooperation with the Executive in so many measures\r\ncalculated to promote the best interests of the nation.\r\n\r\nAnd to my fellow citizens generally I acknowledge a deep sense\r\nof obligation for the support which they have accorded me in my\r\nadministration of the executive department of this Government.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 10, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for consideration by the Senate with a view to\r\nadvising and consenting to its ratification, a convention for commercial\r\nreciprocity between the United States and Spain, providing for an\r\nintimate and favored exchange of products with the islands of Cuba and\r\nPuerto Rico, which convention was signed at Madrid on the 18th ultimo.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations for this convention have been in progress since April\r\nlast, in pursuance of the understanding reached by the two Governments\r\non the 2d of January, 1884, for the improvement of commercial relations\r\nbetween the United States and the Spanish Antilles, by the eighth\r\narticle of which both Governments engaged \"to begin at once negotiations\r\nfor a complete treaty of commerce and navigation between the United\r\nStates of America and the said Provinces of Cuba and Puerto Rico.\"\r\nAlthough this clause was by common consent omitted from the\r\nsubstitutionary agreement of February 13, 1884 (now in force until\r\nreplaced by this convention being carried into effect), the obligation\r\nto enter upon such a negotiation was deemed to continue. With the best\r\ndesire manifest on both sides to reach a common accord, the negotiation\r\nhas been necessarily protracted, owing to the complexity of the details\r\nto be incorporated in order that the convention might respond to the\r\nnational policy of intercourse with the neighboring communities of the\r\nAmerican system, which is outlined in my late annual message to the\r\nCongress in the following words:\r\n\r\n  The conditions of these treaties should be the free admission of\r\n  such merchandise as this country does not produce, in return for\r\n  the admission free, or under a favored scheme of duties, of our\r\n  own products, the benefits of such exchange to apply only to goods\r\n  carried under the flag of the parties to the contract; the removal\r\n  on both sides from the vessels so privileged of all tonnage dues and\r\n  national imposts, so that those vessels may ply unhindered between\r\n  our ports and those of the other contracting parties, though without\r\n  infringing on the reserved home coasting trade; the removal or\r\n  reduction of burdens on the exported products of those countries\r\n  coming within the benefits of the treaties, and the avoidance of\r\n  the technical restrictions and penalties by which our intercourse\r\n  with those countries is at present hampered.\r\n\r\n\r\nA perusal of the convention now submitted will suffice to show how fully\r\nit carries out the policy of intercourse thus announced. I commend it to\r\nyou in the confident expectation that it will receive your sanction.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem necessary to my present purpose to enter into detailed\r\nconsideration of the many immediate and prospective advantages which\r\nwill flow from this convention to our productions and our shipping\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 10, 1884_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty signed on the 1st of December with the Republic\r\nof Nicaragua, providing for the construction of an interoceanic canal\r\nacross the territory of that State.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of this treaty was entered upon under a conviction that\r\nit was imperatively demanded by the present and future political and\r\nmaterial interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of water communication between the Atlantic and\r\nPacific coasts of the Union is a necessity, the accomplishment of which,\r\nhowever, within the territory of the United States is a physical\r\nimpossibility. While the enterprise of our citizens has responded to the\r\nduty of creating means of speedy transit by rail between the two oceans,\r\nthese great achievements are inadequate to supply a most important\r\nrequisite of national union and prosperity.\r\n\r\nFor all maritime purposes the States upon the Pacific are more distant\r\nfrom those upon the Atlantic than if separated by either ocean alone.\r\nEurope and Africa are nearer to New York, and Asia nearer to California,\r\nthan are these two great States to each other by sea. Weeks of steam\r\nvoyage or months under sail are consumed in the passage around the Horn,\r\nwith the disadvantage of traversing tempestuous waters or risking the\r\nnavigation of the Straits of Magellan.\r\n\r\nA nation like ours can not rest satisfied with such a separation of its\r\nmutually dependent members. We possess an ocean border of considerably\r\nover 10,000 miles on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, and, including\r\nAlaska, of some 10,000 miles on the Pacific. Within a generation the\r\nwestern coast has developed into an empire, with a large and rapidly\r\ngrowing population, with vast, but partially developed, resources.\r\nAt the present rate of increase the end of the century will see us a\r\ncommonwealth of perhaps nearly 100,000,000 inhabitants, of which the\r\nWest should have a considerably larger and richer proportion than now.\r\nForming one nation in interests and aims, the East and the West are more\r\nwidely disjoined for all purposes of direct and economical intercourse\r\nby water and of national defense against maritime aggression than are\r\nmost of the colonies of other powers from their mother country.\r\n\r\nThe problem of establishing such water communication has long attracted\r\nattention. Many projects have been formed and surveys have been made of\r\nall possible available routes. As a knowledge of the true topical\r\nconditions of the Isthmus was gained, insuperable difficulties in one\r\ncase and another became evident, until by a process of elimination only\r\ntwo routes remained within range of profitable achievement, one by way\r\nof Panama and the other across Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nThe treaty now laid before you provides for such a waterway through the\r\nfriendly territory of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nI invite your special attention to the provisions of the convention\r\nitself as best evidencing its scope.\r\n\r\nFrom respect to the independent sovereignty of the Republic, through\r\nwhose cooperation the project can alone be realized, the stipulations of\r\nthe treaty look to the fullest recognition and protection of Nicaraguan\r\nrights in the premises. The United States have no motive or desire for\r\nterritorial acquisition or political control beyond the present borders,\r\nand none such is contemplated by this treaty. The two Governments unite\r\nin framing this scheme as the sole means by which the work, as\r\nindispensable to the one as to the other, can be accomplished under such\r\ncircumstances as to prevent alike the possibility of conflict between\r\nthem and of interference from without.\r\n\r\nThe canal is primarily a domestic means of water communication\r\nbetween the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the two countries which unite\r\nfor its construction, the one contributing the territory and the other\r\nfurnishing the money therefor. Recognizing the advantages which the\r\nworld's commerce must derive from the work, appreciating the benefit of\r\nenlarged use to the canal itself by contributing to its maintenance and\r\nby yielding an interest return on the capital invested therein, and\r\ninspired by the belief that any great enterprise which inures to the\r\ngeneral benefit of the world is in some sort a trust for the common\r\nadvancement of mankind, the two Governments have by this treaty provided\r\nfor its peaceable use by all nations on equal terms, while reserving to\r\nthe coasting trade of both countries (in which none but the contracting\r\nparties are interested) the privilege of favoring tolls.\r\n\r\nThe treaty provides for the construction of a railway and telegraph\r\nline, if deemed advisable, as accessories to the canal, as both may be\r\nnecessary for the economical construction of the work and probably in\r\nits operation when completed.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the treaty as to the protection of the canal, while\r\nscrupulously confirming the sovereignty of Nicaragua, amply secure that\r\nState and the work itself from possible contingencies of the future\r\nwhich it may not be within the sole power of Nicaragua to meet.\r\n\r\nFrom a purely commercial point of view the completion of such a waterway\r\nopens a most favorable prospect for the future of our country. The\r\nnations of the Pacific coast of South America will by its means be\r\nbrought into close connection with our Gulf States. The relation of\r\nthose American countries to the United States is that of a natural\r\nmarket, from which the want of direct communication has hitherto\r\npractically excluded us. By piercing the Isthmus the heretofore\r\ninsuperable obstacles of time and sea distance disappear, and our\r\nvessels and productions will enter upon the world's competitive field\r\nwith a decided advantage, of which they will avail themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen to this is joined the large coasting trade between the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific States, which must necessarily spring up, it is evident that\r\nthis canal affords, even alone, an efficient means of restoring our flag\r\nto its former place on the seas.\r\n\r\nSuch a domestic coasting trade would arise immediately, for even the\r\nfishing vessels of both seaboards, which now lie idle in the winter\r\nmonths, could then profitably carry goods between the Eastern and the\r\nWestern States.\r\n\r\nThe political effect of the canal will be to knit closer the States now\r\ndepending upon railway corporations for all commercial and personal\r\nintercourse, and it will not only cheapen the cost of transportation,\r\nbut will free individuals from the possibility of unjust\r\ndiscriminations.\r\n\r\nIt will bring the European grain markets of demand within easy distance\r\nof our Pacific States, and will give to the manufacturers on the\r\nAtlantic seaboard economical access to the cities of China, thus\r\nbreaking down the barrier which separates the principal manufacturing\r\ncenters of the United States from the markets of the vast population of\r\nAsia, and placing the Eastern States of the Union for all purposes of\r\ntrade midway between Europe and Asia. In point of time the gain for\r\nsailing vessels would be great, amounting from New York to San Francisco\r\nto a saving of seventy-five days; to Hongkong, of twenty-seven days;\r\nto Shanghai, of thirty-four days, and to Callao, of fifty-two days.\r\n\r\nLake Nicaragua is about 90 miles long and 40 miles in greatest width.\r\nThe water is fresh, and affords abundant depth for vessels of the\r\ndeepest draft. Several islands give facilities for establishing coaling\r\nstations, supply depots, harbors, and places for repairs. The advantage\r\nof this vast inland harbor is evident.\r\n\r\nThe lake is 110 feet above tide water. Six locks, or five intermediate\r\nlevels, are required for the Pacific end of the canal. On the Atlantic\r\nside but five locks, or four intermediate levels, are proposed. These\r\nlocks would in practice no more limit the number of vessels passing\r\nthrough the canal than would the single tide lock on the Pacific end,\r\nwhich is necessary to any even or sea-level route.\r\n\r\nSeventeen and a half miles of canal lie between the Pacific and the\r\nlake. The distance across the lake is 56 miles, and a dam at the mouth\r\nof the San Carlos (a tributary of the San Juan), raising the water level\r\n49 feet, practically extends the lake 63 miles to that point by a\r\nchannel from 600 to 1,200 feet wide, with an abundant depth of water.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the San Carlos (where the canal will leave the San\r\nJuan) to the harbor of Greytown the distance is 36 miles, which it is\r\nhoped may by new surveys be shortened 10 miles.\r\n\r\nThe total canal excavation would thus be from 43-1/2 to 53-1/2 miles,\r\nand the lake and river navigation, amounting to 119 miles by the present\r\nsurvey, would be somewhat increased if the new surveys are successful.\r\n\r\nFrom New York to San Francisco by this route for sailing vessels the\r\ntime is ten days shorter than by the Panama route.\r\n\r\nThe purely pecuniary prospects of the canal as an investment are\r\nsubordinate to the great national benefits to accrue from it; but it\r\nseems evident that the work, great as its cost may appear, will be a\r\nmeasure of prudent economy and foresight if undertaken simply to afford\r\nour own vessels a free waterway, for its far-reaching results will, even\r\nwithin a few years in the life of a nation, amply repay the expenditure\r\nby the increase of national prosperity. Further, the canal would\r\nunquestionably be immediately remunerative. It offers a shorter sea\r\nvoyage, with more continuously favoring winds, between the Atlantic\r\nports of America and Europe and the countries of the East than any other\r\npracticable route, and with lower tolls, by reason of its lesser cost,\r\nthe Nicaragua route must be the interoceanic highway for the bulk of the\r\nworld's trade between the Atlantic and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nSo strong is this consideration that it offers an abundant guaranty for\r\nthe investment to be made, as well as for the speedy payment of the loan\r\nof four millions which the treaty stipulates shall be made to Nicaragua\r\nfor the construction of internal improvements to serve as aids to the\r\nbusiness of the canal.\r\n\r\nI might suggest many other considerations in detail, but it seems\r\nunnecessary to do so. Enough has been said to more than justify the\r\npractical utility of the measure. I therefore commit it to the Congress\r\nin the confident expectation that it will receive approval, and that by\r\nappropriate legislation means may be provided for inaugurating the work\r\nwithout delay after the treaty shall have been ratified.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I urge the justice of recognizing the aid which has\r\nrecently been rendered in this matter by some of our citizens. The\r\nefforts of certain gentlemen connected with the American company which\r\nreceived the concession from Nicaragua (now terminated and replaced by\r\nthis international compact) accomplished much of the preliminary labors\r\nleading to the conclusion of the treaty.\r\n\r\nYou may have occasion to examine the matter of their services, when such\r\nfurther information as you may desire will be furnished you.\r\n\r\nI may add that the canal can be constructed by the able Engineer Corps\r\nof our Army, under their thorough system, cheaper and better than any\r\nwork of such magnitude can in any other way be built.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 27, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 22d instant, setting\r\nforth that--\r\n\r\n  Whereas the United States, in 1866, acquired from the Creek and\r\n  Seminole Indians by treaty certain lands situate in the Indian\r\n  Territory, a portion of which have remained unoccupied until the\r\n  present time; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas a widely extended belief exists that such unoccupied lands are\r\n  public lands of the United States, and as such subject to homestead and\r\n  preemption settlement, and pursuant to such belief a large number of\r\n  citizens of the United States have gone upon them claiming the right\r\n  to settle and acquire title thereto under the general land laws of the\r\n  United States; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas it is understood that the President of the United States does\r\n  not regard said lands as open to settlement and believes it to be his\r\n  duty to remove all persons who go upon the same claiming the right to\r\n  settle thereon, and for that purpose has directed the expulsion of the\r\n  persons now on said lands by the use of military force, and there seems\r\n  to be a probability of a conflict growing out of the attempt to expel\r\n  said persons so claiming right and attempting to settle: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President be requested to advise the Senate as\r\n  to the status of the lands in question as viewed by the Executive, the\r\n  action taken, if any, to expel persons seeking to settle thereon, and\r\n  the reasons for the same, together with any other information in his\r\n  possession bearing upon the existing controversy--\r\n\r\n\r\nI have the honor to state that the matter was referred to the\r\nSecretaries of War and the Interior and to transmit herewith their\r\nrespective reports thereon, dated the 26th instant.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs accompanying that\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior recites fully the provisions of the\r\ntreaties made with the Indian tribes ceding the lands in question to\r\nthe United States, showing the condition and purposes expressed in\r\nsaid treaties regarding said lands, as well as the action taken with\r\nreference thereto, from which it will be seen that they are not open\r\nto settlement under any laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows the action of the military\r\nauthorities at the request of the Interior Department under section 2147\r\nof the Revised Statutes.\r\n\r\nThe status of these lands was considered by my predecessor, President\r\nHayes, who on the 26th day of April, 1879, issued a proclamation[25]\r\nwarning all persons intending to go upon said lands without proper\r\npermission of the Interior Department that they would be speedily and\r\nimmediately removed therefrom according to the laws made and provided,\r\nand that if necessary the aid and assistance of the military forces of\r\nthe United States would be invoked to carry into proper execution the\r\nlaws of the United States referring thereto. A similar proclamation[26]\r\nwas issued by President Hayes on the 12th day of February, 1880. On the\r\n1st day of July, 1884, I considered it to be my duty to issue a\r\nproclamation[27] of like import.\r\n\r\nThese several proclamations were at the request of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by the report of the Secretary of War, the military\r\nforces of the United States have been repeatedly employed to remove\r\nintruders from the lands in question, and that notwithstanding such\r\nremovals and in disregard of law and the Executive proclamations a large\r\nbody of intruders is now within the territory in question, and that an\r\nadequate force of troops has been ordered to remove the intruders and is\r\nnow being concentrated for that purpose.\r\n\r\nNone of the land or general laws of the United States have been extended\r\nover these lands except as to the punishment for crimes and other\r\nprovisions contained in the intercourse act which relate to trade and\r\nthe introduction of spirituous liquors and arms among Indians, and do\r\nnot sanction settlement. It is clear that no authorized settlement can\r\nbe made by any person in the territory in question.\r\n\r\nUntil the existing status of these lands shall have been changed by\r\nagreement with the Indians interested, or in some other manner as may be\r\ndetermined by Congress, the treaties heretofore made with the Indians\r\nshould be maintained and the power of the Government to the extent\r\nnecessary should be exercised to keep off intruders and all unauthorized\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 30, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nWhen the expedition for the relief of Lieutenant Greely and his party\r\nwas being prepared, in the early part of the year 1884, and a search for\r\nsuitable vessels was being made, the _Alert_, then the property of\r\nGreat Britain, and which had been the advance ship of the expedition\r\nunder Sir George Nares, was found to be peculiarly fitted for the\r\nintended service, and this Government immediately offered to purchase\r\nthat vessel, upon which Her Majesty's Government generously presented\r\nher to the United States, refusing to accept any pay whatever for the\r\nvessel. The _Alert_ rendered important and timely service in the\r\nexpedition for the relief of Lieutenant Greely and party, which in its\r\nresults proved so satisfactory to the Government and people of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that the _Alert_ should now be returned to Her\r\nMajesty's Government, with suitable acknowledgments for its generous and\r\ngraceful acts of courtesy in so promptly putting the vessel at the\r\nservice of the United States, and I therefore recommend that authority\r\nbe given me by Congress to carry out this purpose.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 2, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the House of Representatives of January\r\n28, 1885, \"that the President be respectfully requested to transmit to\r\nthis House a copy of the recent appeal of Fitz John Porter, together\r\nwith the accompanying papers,\" I transmit herewith a copy of a\r\ncommunication from Fitz John Porter, addressed to the President from\r\nMorristown, N.J., under date of October 14, 1884, together with copies\r\nof the accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 3, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI take especial pleasure in laying before Congress the generous offer\r\nmade by Mrs. Grant to give to the Government, in perpetual trust, the\r\nswords and military (and civil) testimonials lately belonging to General\r\nGrant. A copy of the deed of trust and of a letter addressed to me by\r\nMr. William H. Vanderbilt, which I transmit herewith, will explain the\r\nnature and motives of this offer.\r\n\r\nAppreciation of General Grant's achievements and recognition of his just\r\nfame have in part taken the shape of numerous mementoes and gifts which,\r\nwhile dear to him, possess for the nation an exceptional interest.\r\n\r\nThese relics, of great historical value, have passed into the hands of\r\nanother, whose considerate action has restored the collection to Mrs.\r\nGrant as a life trust, on the condition that at the death of General\r\nGrant, or sooner, at Mrs. Grant's option, it should become the property\r\nof the Government, as set forth in the accompanying papers. In the\r\nexercise of the option thus given her Mrs. Grant elects that the trust\r\nshall forthwith determine, and asks that the Government designate a\r\nsuitable place of deposit and a responsible custodian for the\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this gift and the value of the relics which the generosity\r\nof a private citizen, joined to the high sense of public regard which\r\nanimates Mrs. Grant, have thus placed at the disposal of the Government,\r\ndemand full and signal recognition on behalf of the nation at the hands\r\nof its representatives. I therefore ask Congress to take suitable action\r\nto accept the trust and to provide for its secure custody, at the same\r\ntime recording the appreciative gratitude of the people of the United\r\nStates to the donors.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I may pertinently advert to the pending legislation\r\nof the Senate and House of Representatives looking to a national\r\nrecognition of General Grant's eminent services by providing the means\r\nfor his restoration to the Army on the retired list. That Congress, by\r\ntaking such action, will give expression to the almost universal desire\r\nof the people of this nation is evident, and I earnestly urge the\r\npassage of an act similar to Senate bill No. 2530, which, while not\r\ninterfering with the constitutional prerogative of appointment, will\r\nenable the President in his discretion to nominate General Grant as\r\ngeneral upon the retired list.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEED OF TRUST.\r\n\r\n  Whereas I, William H.

ARTHUR,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: I purchased the articles of historical interest belonging\r\nto General Grant and gave them to Mrs. Grant in trust to hold during\r\nthe lifetime of the General, and at his death, or sooner, at her\r\noption, they to become the property of the Government. They consist of\r\nhis swords, memorials of his victories from the United States, States,\r\nand cities, and tributes to his fame and achievements from governments\r\nall over the world. In their proper place at Washington they will\r\nalways be secure and will afford pleasure and instruction to succeeding\r\ngenerations. This trust has been accepted by Mrs. Grant, and the\r\ndisposition of the articles is in conformity to the wishes of the\r\nGeneral. I transmit to you herewith the deed of trust. Mrs. Grant\r\ninforms me that she prefers to close the trust at once and send the\r\nmemorials to Washington. May I ask, therefore, that you will designate\r\nsome official, representing the proper Department, to receive them, and\r\ndirect him to notify Mrs. Grant of the arrangements necessary to perfect\r\nthe transfer and deposit in such of the Government buildings as may be\r\nmost suitable?\r\n\r\nYours, respectfully,\r\n\r\nW.H. VANDERBILT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 5, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a communication from the Secretary of State,\r\nrelative to the Japanese Government's offer to donate a valuable piece\r\nof land to the United States in fee simple for legation purposes, and\r\nearnestly recommend that the Executive may be immediately authorized to\r\naccept the gift in the name of the United States and to tender to his\r\nImperial Japanese Majesty's Government a suitable expression of this\r\nGovernment's thanks for the generosity which prompted the presentation\r\nof so desirable a site of ground.\r\n\r\nI deem it unnecessary to enlarge upon the statement of the Secretary of\r\nState. I feel certain, however, that a perusal of his communication will\r\nat once commend itself to the favorable attention of Congress, and doubt\r\nnot that the necessary authorization of Congress will be immediately\r\ngiven for the acceptance of the gift, as well as insure early action\r\nlooking to the erection on the premises of suitable public buildings for\r\nthe use of the legation of the United States at Tokyo. This step can not\r\nbut be favorable to the United States in every honorable way, while the\r\ndisinterested motives of a friendly foreign government deserve from us\r\na proper and just recognition.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 11, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of Congress approved January 16, 1883,\r\nentitled \"An act to regulate and improve the civil service of the United\r\nStates,\" the Civil Service Commission has made to the President its\r\nsecond annual report.\r\n\r\nThat report is herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe Commission is in the second year of its existence. The President\r\ncongratulates the country upon the success of its labors, commends the\r\nsubject to the favorable consideration of Congress, and asks for an\r\nappropriation to continue the work.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 12, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a copy of the report of the board of management of\r\nthe World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition, dated February\r\n2, 1885, requesting an additional appropriation to extinguish a deficit\r\nin its accounts, and asking authority to reopen the exhibition during\r\nthe winter of 1885-86.\r\n\r\nA failure on the part of the management to carry out the original intent\r\nin regard to the exposition might reflect upon the honor of the United\r\nStates Government, since twenty-one foreign nations and forty-six States\r\nand Territories have joined in the enterprise through faith in the\r\nsanction of the Government. In view of this fact and in consideration\r\nof the value of the exposition to the cause of material progress and\r\ngeneral education, I respectfully submit the report mentioned for the\r\nfavorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.

In case any question should\r\n  arise between the Governments of the United States and of Her\r\n  Britannic Majesty as to the common right of fishing in places not thus\r\n  designated as reserved, it is agreed that a commission shall be\r\n  appointed to designate such places, and shall be constituted in the\r\n  same manner and have the same powers, duties, and authority as the\r\n  commission appointed under the said first article of the treaty of the\r\n  5th of June, 1854.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE XXI.\r\n\r\n  It is agreed that for the term of years mentioned in Article XXXIII of\r\n  this treaty fish oil and fish of all kinds (except fish of the inland\r\n  lakes and of the rivers falling into them, and except fish preserved\r\n  in oil), being the produce of the fisheries of the United States, or\r\n  of the Dominion of Canada, or of Prince Edwards Island, shall be\r\n  admitted into each country, respectively, free of duty.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE XXII.\r\n\r\n  Inasmuch as it is asserted by the Government of Her Britannic Majesty\r\n  that the privileges accorded to the citizens of the United States\r\n  under Article XVIII of this treaty are of greater value than those\r\n  accorded by Articles XIX and XXI of this treaty to the subjects of Her\r\n  Britannic Majesty, and this assertion is not admitted by the\r\n  Government of the United States, it is further agreed that\r\n  commissioners shall be appointed to determine, having regard to the\r\n  privileges accorded by the United States to the subjects of Her\r\n  Britannic Majesty, as stated in Articles XIX and XXI of this treaty,\r\n  the amount of any compensation which in their opinion ought to be paid\r\n  by the Government of the United States to the Government of Her\r\n  Britannic Majesty in return for the privileges accorded to the\r\n  citizens of the United States under Article XVIII of this treaty; and\r\n  that any sum of money which the said commissioners may so award shall\r\n  be paid by the United States Government, in a gross sum, within twelve\r\n  months after such award shall have been given.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE XXIII.\r\n\r\n  The commissioners referred to in the preceding article shall be\r\n  appointed in the following manner; that is to say: One commissioner\r\n  shall be named by the President of the United States, one by Her\r\n  Britannic Majesty, and a third by the President of the United States\r\n  and Her Britannic Majesty conjointly; and in case the third\r\n  commissioner shall not have been so named within a period of three\r\n  months from the date when this article shall take effect, then the\r\n  third commissioner shall be named by the representative at London of\r\n  His Majesty the Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary. In case of the\r\n  death, absence, or incapacity of any commissioner, or in the event of\r\n  any commissioner omitting or ceasing to act, the vacancy shall be\r\n  filled in the manner hereinbefore provided for making the original\r\n  appointment, the period of three months in case of such substitution\r\n  being calculated from the date of the happening of the vacancy.\r\n\r\n  The commissioners so named shall meet in the city of Halifax, in the\r\n  Province of Nova Scotia, at the earliest convenient period after they\r\n  have been respectively named, and shall before proceeding to any\r\n  business make and subscribe a solemn declaration that they will\r\n  impartially and carefully examine and decide the matters referred\r\n  to them to the best of their judgment and according to justice and\r\n  equity; and such declaration shall be entered on the record of their\r\n  proceedings.\r\n\r\n  Each of the high contracting parties shall also name one person to\r\n  attend the commission as its agent, to represent it generally in all\r\n  matters connected with the commission.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE XXIV.\r\n\r\n  The proceedings shall be conducted in such order as the commissioners\r\n  appointed under Articles XXII and XXIII of this treaty shall\r\n  determine. They shall be bound to receive such oral or written\r\n  testimony as either Government may present. If either party shall\r\n  offer oral testimony, the other party shall have the right of\r\n  cross-examination, under such rules as the commissioners shall\r\n  prescribe.\r\n\r\n  If in the case submitted to the commissioners either party shall have\r\n  specified or alluded to any report or document in its own exclusive\r\n  possession, without annexing a copy, such party shall be bound, if the\r\n  other party thinks proper to apply for it, to furnish that party with\r\n  a copy thereof; and either party may call upon the other, through the\r\n  commissioners, to produce the originals or certified copies of any\r\n  papers adduced as evidence, giving in each instance such reasonable\r\n  notice as the commissioners may require.\r\n\r\n  The case on either side shall be closed within a period of six\r\n  months from the date of the organization of the commission, and\r\n  the commissioners shall be requested to give their award as soon\r\n  as possible thereafter. The aforesaid period of six months may be\r\n  extended for three months in case of a vacancy occurring among the\r\n  commissioners under the circumstances contemplated in Article XXIII\r\n  of this treaty.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE XXV.\r\n\r\n  The commissioners shall keep an accurate record and correct minutes\r\n  or notes of all their proceedings, with the dates thereof, and may\r\n  appoint and employ a secretary and any other necessary officer or\r\n  officers to assist them in the transaction of the business which may\r\n  come before them.\r\n\r\n  Each of the high contracting parties shall pay its own commissioner\r\n  and agent or counsel; all other expenses shall be defrayed by the two\r\n  Governments in equal moieties.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE XXX.\r\n\r\n  It is agreed that for the term of years mentioned in Article XXXIII of\r\n  this treaty subjects of Her Britannic Majesty may carry in British\r\n  vessels, without payment of duty, goods, wares, or merchandise from\r\n  one port or place within the territory of the United States upon the\r\n  St. Lawrence, the Great Lakes, and the rivers connecting the same, to\r\n  another port or place within the territory of the United States as\r\n  aforesaid: _Provided_, That a portion of such transportation is\r\n  made through the Dominion of Canada by land carriage and in bond,\r\n  under such rules and regulations as may be agreed upon between the\r\n  Government of Her Britannic Majesty and the Government of the United\r\n  States.\r\n\r\n  Citizens of the United States may for the like period carry in United\r\n  States vessels, without payment of duty, goods, wares, or merchandise\r\n  from one port or place within the possessions of Her Britannic Majesty\r\n  in North America to another port or place within the said possessions:\r\n  _Provided_, That a portion of such transportation is made through\r\n  the territory of the United States by land carriage and in bond, under\r\n  such rules and regulations as may be agreed upon between the\r\n  Government of the United States and the Government of Her Britannic\r\n  Majesty.\r\n\r\n  The Government of the United States further engages not to impose\r\n  any export duties on goods, wares, or merchandise carried under this\r\n  article through the territory of the United States; and Her Majesty's\r\n  Government engages to urge the parliament of the Dominion of Canada\r\n  and the legislatures of the other colonies not to impose any export\r\n  duties on goods, wares, or merchandise carried under this article; and\r\n  the Government of the United States may, in case such export duties\r\n  are imposed by the Dominion of Canada, suspend during the period that\r\n  such duties are imposed the right of carrying granted under this\r\n  article in favor of the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty.\r\n\r\n  The Government of the United States may suspend the right of carrying\r\n  granted in favor of the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty under this\r\n  article in case the Dominion of Canada should at any time deprive the\r\n  citizens of the United States of the use of the canals in the said\r\n  Dominion on terms of equality with the inhabitants of the Dominion,\r\n  as provided in Article XXVII.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE XXXII.\r\n\r\n  It is further agreed that the provisions and stipulations of Articles\r\n  XVIII to XXV of this treaty, inclusive, shall extend to the colony\r\n  of Newfoundland, so far as they are applicable. But if the Imperial\r\n  Parliament, the legislature of Newfoundland, or the Congress of the\r\n  United States shall not embrace the colony of Newfoundland in their\r\n  laws enacted for carrying the foregoing articles into effect, then\r\n  this article shall be of no effect; but the omission to make provision\r\n  by law to give it effect by either of the legislative bodies aforesaid\r\n  shall not in any way impair any other articles of this treaty.\r\n\r\n  And whereas, pursuant to the provisions of Article XXXIII of said\r\n  treaty, due notice has been given to the Government of Her Britannic\r\n  Majesty of the intention of the Government of the United States of\r\n  America to terminate the above-recited articles of the treaty in\r\n  question on the 1st day of July, 1885; and\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas, pursuant to the terms of said treaty and of the notice given\r\nthereunder by the Government of the United States of America to that\r\nof Her Britannic Majesty, the above-recited articles of the treaty of\r\nWashington, concluded May 8, 1871, will expire and terminate on the\r\n1st day of July, 1885:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Chester A.

Those classified in the Departments at Washington shall be designated\r\n  \"The classified departmental service.\"\r\n\r\n  2. Those classified under any collector, naval officer, surveyor, or\r\n  appraiser in any customs district shall be designated \"The classified\r\n  customs service.\"\r\n\r\n  3. Those classified under any postmaster at any post-office, including\r\n  that at Washington, shall be designated \"The classified postal service.\"\r\n\r\n  4.

The Commission may also order examinations upon other subjects\r\n  of a technical or special character to test the capacity which may be\r\n  needed in any part of the classified service which requires peculiar\r\n  information or skill. Examinations hereunder may be competitive or\r\n  noncompetitive, and the maximum limitations of age contained in the\r\n  twelfth rule shall not apply to applicants for the same. The application\r\n  for and notice of these special examinations, the records thereof,\r\n  and the certification of those found competent shall be such as the\r\n  Commission may provide for. After consulting the head of any Department\r\n  or office the Commission may from time to time designate, subject to the\r\n  approval of the President, the positions therein for which applicants\r\n  may be required to pass the special examination.\r\n\r\n  RULE XI.\r\n\r\n  1.

No person under enlistment in the Army or Navy of the United States\r\n  shall be examined under these rules except for some place in the\r\n  Department under which he is enlisted requiring special qualifications,\r\n  and with the consent in writing of the head of such Department.\r\n\r\n  3. The Commission may by regulations, subject to change at any time\r\n  by the President, declare the kind and measure of ill health, physical\r\n  incapacity, misrepresentation, and bad faith which may properly exclude\r\n  any person from the right of examination, grading, or certification\r\n  under these rules. It may also provide for medical certificates of\r\n  physical capacity in the following cases, and for the appropriate\r\n  certification of persons so defective in sight, speech, hearing, or\r\n  otherwise as to be apparently disqualified for some of the duties of\r\n  the part of the service which they seek to enter.\r\n\r\n  RULE XVI.\r\n\r\n  1. Whenever any officer having the power of appointment or employment\r\n  shall so request, there shall be certified to him by the Commission or\r\n  the proper examining board four names for the vacancy specified, to be\r\n  taken from those graded highest on the proper register of those in his\r\n  branch of the service and remaining eligible, regard being had to any\r\n  right of preference and to the apportionment of appointments to States\r\n  and Territories; and from the said four a selection shall be made for\r\n  the vacancy. But if a person is on both a general and special register\r\n  he need be certified from the former only, at the discretion of the\r\n  Commission, until he has remained two months upon the latter.\r\n\r\n  2. These certifications for the service at Washington shall be made\r\n  in such order as to apportion, as nearly as may be practicable, the\r\n  original appointments thereto among the States and Territories and the\r\n  District of Columbia upon the basis of population as ascertained at the\r\n  last preceding census.\r\n\r\n  3. In case the request for any such certification or any law or\r\n  regulation shall call for those of either sex, persons of that sex shall\r\n  be certified; otherwise sex shall be disregarded in such certification.\r\n\r\n  4. No person upon any register shall be certified more than four times\r\n  to the same officer in the customs or postal service or more than twice\r\n  to any Department at Washington, unless upon request of the appointing\r\n  officer; nor shall anyone remain eligible more than one year upon any\r\n  register; but these restrictions shall not extend to examinations under\r\n  clause 5 of Rule VII. No person while remaining eligible on any register\r\n  shall be admitted to a new examination, and no person having failed upon\r\n  any examination shall within six months thereafter be admitted to\r\n  another examination without the consent of the Commission.\r\n\r\n  5. Any person appointed to or employed in any part of the classified\r\n  service, after due certification for the same under these rules, who\r\n  shall be dismissed or separated therefrom without cause or delinquency\r\n  on his part may be reappointed or reemployed in the same part or grade\r\n  of such service at the same office, within eight months next following\r\n  such dismissal or separation, without further examination.\r\n\r\n  RULE XVII.\r\n\r\n  1. Every original appointment or employment in said classified service\r\n  shall be for the probationary period of six months, at the end of which\r\n  time, if the conduct and capacity of the person appointed have been\r\n  found satisfactory, the probationer shall be absolutely appointed or\r\n  employed, but otherwise be deemed out of the service.\r\n\r\n  2. Every officer under whom any probationer shall serve during any part\r\n  of the probation provided for by these rules shall carefully observe the\r\n  quality and value of the service rendered by such probationer, and shall\r\n  report to the proper appointing officer, in writing, the facts observed\r\n  by him, showing the character and qualifications of such probationer and\r\n  of the service performed by him; and such report shall be preserved on\r\n  file.\r\n\r\n  3. Every false statement knowingly made by any person in his application\r\n  for examination, and every connivance by him at any false statement made\r\n  in any certificate which may accompany his application, and every\r\n  deception or fraud practiced by him or by any person in his behalf and\r\n  with his knowledge to influence his examination, certification, or\r\n  appointment, shall be regarded as good cause for the removal or\r\n  discharge of such person during his probation or thereafter.\r\n\r\n  RULE XXI.\r\n\r\n  1. No person, unless excepted under Rule XIX, shall be admitted into the\r\n  classified civil service from any place not within said service without\r\n  an examination and certification under the rules; nor shall any person\r\n  who has passed only a limited examination under clause 4 of Rule VII for\r\n  the lower classes or grades in the departmental or customs service be\r\n  appointed, or be promoted within two years after appointment, to any\r\n  position giving a salary of $1,000 or upward without first passing an\r\n  examination under clause I of said rule; and such examination shall not\r\n  be allowed within the first year after appointment.\r\n\r\n  2.

ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of the power vested in the President by the\r\nConstitution, and by virtue of the seventeen hundred and fifty-third\r\nsection of the Revised Statutes and of the civil-service act approved\r\nJanuary 16, 1883, the following rules for the regulation and improvement\r\nof the executive civil service are hereby amended and promulgated, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  RULE V.\r\n\r\n  There shall be three branches of the service classified under the\r\n  civil-service act (not including laborers or workmen or officers\r\n  required to be confirmed by the Senate), as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Those classified in the Departments at Washington shall be designated\r\n  \"The classified departmental service.\"\r\n\r\n  2. Those classified under any collector, naval officer, surveyor, or\r\n  appraiser in any customs district shall be designated \"The classified\r\n  customs service.\"\r\n\r\n  3. Those classified under any postmaster at any post-office, including\r\n  that at Washington, shall be designated \"The classified postal service.\"\r\n\r\n  4. The classified customs service shall embrace the several customs\r\n  districts where the officials are as many as fifty, now the following:\r\n  New York City, N.Y.; Boston, Mass.; Philadelphia, Pa.; San Francisco,\r\n  Cal.; Baltimore, Md.; New Orleans, La.; Chicago, Ill.; Burlington, Vt.;\r\n  Portland, Me.; Detroit, Mich.; Port Huron, Mich.\r\n\r\n  5. The classified postal service shall embrace the several post-offices\r\n  where the officials are as many as fifty, now the following: Albany,\r\n  N.Y.; Baltimore, Md.; Boston, Mass.; Brooklyn, N.Y.; Buffalo, N.Y.;\r\n  Chicago, Ill.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.;\r\n  Indianapolis, Ind.; Jersey City, N.J.; Kansas City, Mo.; Louisville,\r\n  Ky.; Milwaukee, Wis.; Minneapolis, Minn.; Newark, N.J.; New Haven,\r\n  Conn.; New Orleans, La.; New York City, N.Y.; Philadelphia, Pa.;\r\n  Pittsburg, Pa.; Providence, R.I.; Rochester, N.Y.; St. Louis, Mo.;\r\n  St. Paul, Minn.; San Francisco, Cal.; Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n  6. Whenever within the meaning of said act the clerks and persons\r\n  employed by the collector, naval officer, surveyor, and appraisers, or\r\n  either of them, in any customs district shall be as many as fifty, any\r\n  existing classification for the customs service shall apply thereto, and\r\n  when the number of clerks and persons employed at any post-office shall\r\n  be as many as fifty any existing classification of those in the postal\r\n  service shall apply thereto; and thereafter the Commission will provide\r\n  for examinations for filling the vacancies at said offices, and the\r\n  rules will be applicable thereto.\r\n\r\n  RULE XIII\r\n\r\n  1. The date of the reception of all regular applications for the\r\n  classified departmental service shall be entered of record by the\r\n  Commission, and of all other regular applications by the proper\r\n  examining boards of the district or office for which they are made; and\r\n  applicants, when in excess of the number that can be examined at a\r\n  single examination, shall, subject to the needs of apportionment, be\r\n  notified to appear in their order on the respective records. But any\r\n  applicants in the several States and Territories for appointment in the\r\n  classified departmental service may be notified to appear for\r\n  examination at any place at which an examination is to be held, whether\r\n  in any State or Territory or in Washington, which shall be deemed most\r\n  convenient for them.\r\n\r\n  2. The Commission is authorized, in aid of the apportionment among the\r\n  States and Territories, to hold examinations at places convenient for\r\n  applicants from different States and Territories, or for those\r\n  examination districts which it may designate and which the President\r\n  shall approve.\r\n\r\n  3. The Commission may by regulation provide for dropping from any record\r\n  the applicants whose names have remained thereon for six months or more\r\n  without having been reached in due course for notification to be\r\n  examined.\r\n\r\n  RULE XVI.\r\n\r\n  1. Whenever any officer having the power of appointment or employment\r\n  shall so request, there shall be certified to him by the Commission or\r\n  the proper examining board four names for the vacancy specified, to be\r\n  taken from those graded highest on the proper register of those in his\r\n  branch of the service and remaining eligible, regard being had to any\r\n  right of preference and to the apportionment of appointments to States\r\n  and Territories; and from the said four a selection shall be made for\r\n  the vacancy. But if a person is on both a general and a special register\r\n  he need be certified from the former only, at the discretion of the\r\n  Commission, until he has remained two months upon the latter.\r\n\r\n  2. These certifications for the service at Washington shall be made\r\n  in such order as to apportion, as nearly as may be practicable, the\r\n  original appointments thereto among the States and Territories and the\r\n  District of Columbia upon the basis of population as ascertained at\r\n  the last preceding census.\r\n\r\n  3. In case the request for any such certification or any law or\r\n  regulation shall call for those of either sex, persons of that sex shall\r\n  be certified; otherwise sex shall be disregarded in such certification.\r\n\r\n  4. No person upon any register shall be certified more than four times\r\n  to the same officer in the customs or postal service or more than three\r\n  times to any Department at Washington, unless upon request of the\r\n  appointing officer; nor shall anyone remain eligible more than one\r\n  year upon any register; but these restrictions shall not extend to\r\n  examinations under clause 5 of Rule VII. No person while remaining\r\n  eligible on any register shall be admitted to a new examination, and\r\n  no person having failed upon any examination shall within six months\r\n  thereafter be admitted to another examination without the consent of\r\n  the Commission.\r\n\r\n  5. Any person appointed to or employed in any part of the classified\r\n  service, after due certification for the same under these rules, who\r\n  shall be dismissed or separated therefrom without fault or delinquency\r\n  on his part, may be reappointed or reemployed in the same part or grade\r\n  of such service in the same Department or office within one year next\r\n  following such dismissal or separation, without further examination,\r\n  on such certification as the Commission may provide.\r\n\r\nApproved, January 24, 1885.\r\n\r\nCHESTER A.
