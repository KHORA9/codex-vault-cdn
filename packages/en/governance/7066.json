O'Higgins was in Denver, in the spring of 1910, working\r\nwith Judge Ben B. Lindsey on the manuscript of \"The Beast and the\r\nJungle,\" for Everybody's Magazine, he met the Hon. Frank J. Cannon,\r\nformerly United States Senator from Utah, and heard from him the story\r\nof the betrayal of Utah by the present leaders of the Mormon Church.\r\nThis story the editor of Everybody's Magazine commissioned Messrs.\r\nCannon and O'Higgins to write. They worked on it for a year, verifying\r\nevery detail of it from government reports, controversial pamphlets,\r\nMormon books of propaganda, and the newspaper files of current record.\r\nIt ran through nine numbers of the magazine, and not so much as a\r\nsuccessful contradiction was ever made of one of the innumerable\r\nincidents or accusations that it contains. It is here published in book\r\nform at somewhat greater length than the magazine could print it. It\r\nis a joint work, but the autobiographic \"I\" has been used throughout,\r\nbecause it is Mr. Cannon's personal narrative of his personal\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the story of what has been called \"the great American\r\ndespotism.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the story of the establishment of an absolute throne and dynasty\r\nby one American citizen over a half-million others.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the story of the amazing reign of this one man, Joseph F.\r\nSmith, the Mormon Prophet, a religious fanatic of bitter mind, who\r\nclaims that he has been divinely ordained to exercise the awful\r\nauthority of God on earth over all the affairs of all mankind, and who\r\nplays the anointed despot in Utah and the surrounding states as cruelly\r\nas a Sultan and more securely than any Czar.\r\n\r\nTo him the Mormon people pay a yearly tribute of more than two million\r\ndollars in tithes; and he uses that income, to his own ends, without an\r\naccounting. He is president of the Utah branch of the sugar trust, and\r\nof the local incorporation's of the salt trust; and he supports the\r\nexaction's of monopoly by his financial absolutism, while he defends\r\nthem from competition by his religious power of interdict and\r\nexcommunication. He is president of a system of \"company stores,\" from\r\nwhich the faithful buy their merchandise; of a wagon and machine company\r\nfrom which the Mormon farmers purchase their vehicles and implements; of\r\nlife-insurance and fire-insurance companies, of banking institutions,\r\nof a railroad, of a knitting company, of newspapers, which the Mormon\r\npeople are required by their Church to patronize, and through which they\r\nare exploited, commercially and financially, for the sole profit of the\r\nsovereign of Utah and his religious court.\r\n\r\nHe is the political Boss of the state, delivering the votes of his\r\npeople by revelation of the Will of God, practically appointing the\r\nUnited States Senators from Utah--as he practically appoints the\r\nmarshals, district attorneys, judges, legislators, officers and\r\nadministrators of law throughout his \"Kingdom of God on Earth\"--and\r\nruling the non-Mormons of Utah, as he rules his own people, by virtue\r\nof his political and financial partnership with the great \"business\r\ninterests\" that govern and exploit this nation, and his Kingdom, for\r\ntheir own gain, and his.\r\n\r\nHe lives, like the Grand Turk, openly with five wives, against the\r\ntemporal law of the state, against the spiritual law of his Kingdom, and\r\nin violation of his own solemn covenant to the country--which he gave in\r\n1890, in order to obtain amnesty for himself from criminal prosecution\r\nand to help Utah obtain the powers of statehood which he has since\r\nusurped. He secretly preaches a proscribed doctrine of polygamy as\r\nnecessary to salvation; he publicly denies his own teaching, so that he\r\nmay escape responsibility for the sufferings of the \"plural wives\" and\r\ntheir unfortunate children, who have been betrayed by the authority of\r\nhis dogma. And these women, by the hundreds, seduced into clandestine\r\nmarriage relations with polygamous elders of the Church, unable to claim\r\ntheir husbands--even in some cases disowning their children and\r\nteaching these children to deny their parents--are suffering a pitiful\r\nself-immolation as martyrs to the religious barbarism of his rule.\r\n\r\nDemanding unquestioning obedience in all things, as the \"mouthpiece\r\nof the Lord,\" and \"sole vice-regent of God on Earth,\" he enforces his\r\ndemands by his religious, political and financial control of the faith,\r\nthe votes and the property of his fellow-citizens. He is at once--as\r\nthe details of this story show--\"the modern 'money king,' the absolute\r\npolitical Czar, the social despot and the infallible Pope of his\r\nKingdom.\"\r\n\r\nEx-Senator Cannon not only exposes but accounts for and explains the\r\nconditions that have made the Church-controlled government of Utah less\r\nfree, less of a democracy, a greater tyranny and more of a disgrace to\r\nthe nation than ever the corporation rule of Colorado was in the darkest\r\nperiod of the Cripple Creek labor war. He shows the enemies of the\r\nrepublic encouraging and profiting by the shame of Utah as they\r\nsupported and made gain of Colorado's past disgrace. He shows the\r\npiratical \"Interests,\" at Washington, sustaining, and sustained by, the\r\nmisgovernment of Utah, in their campaign of national pillage. He shows\r\nthat the condition of Utah today is not merely a local problem; that it\r\naffects and concerns the people of the whole country; that it can only\r\nbe cured with their aid.\r\n\r\nThe outside world has waited many years to hear the truth about the\r\nMormons; here it is--told with sympathy, with affection, by a man who\r\nsteadfastly defended and fought for the Mormon people when their present\r\nleaders were keeping themselves carefully inconspicuous. The Mormon\r\nsystem of religious communism has long been known as one of the most\r\ninteresting social experiments of modern civilization; here is an\r\nintimate study of it, not only in its success but in the failure that\r\nhas come upon it from the selfish ambitions of its leaders. The power of\r\nthe Mormon hierarchy has been the theme of much imaginative fiction; but\r\nhere is a story of church tyranny and misgovernment in the name of God,\r\nthat outrages the credibilities of art. That such a story could come\r\nout of modern America--that such conditions could be possible in the\r\ndemocracy today--is an amazement that staggers belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Frank J. Cannon is the son of George Q. Cannon of Utah, who was\r\nFirst Councillor of the Mormon Church from 1880 to 1901. After the\r\ndeath of Brigham Young, George Q. Cannon's diplomacy saved the Mormon\r\ncommunism from destruction by the United States government. It was his\r\ninfluence that lifted the curse of polygamy from the Mormon faith. Under\r\nhis leadership Utah obtained the right of statehood; and his financial\r\npolicies were establishing the Mormon people in industrial prosperity\r\nwhen he died.\r\n\r\nIn all these achievements the son shared with his father, and in some of\r\nthem--notably in the obtaining of Utah's statehood--he had even a larger\r\npart than George Q. Cannon himself. When the Mormon communities, in\r\n1888, were being crushed by proscription and confiscation and the\r\nrighteous bigotries of Federal officials, Frank J. Cannon went to\r\nWashington, alone--almost from the doors of a Federal prison--and,\r\nby the eloquence of his plea for his people, obtained from President\r\nCleveland a mercy for the Mormons that all the diplomacies of the\r\nChurch's politicians had been unable to procure. Again, in 1890, when\r\nthe Mormons were threatened with a general disfranchisement by means of\r\na test oath, he returned to Washington and saved them, with the aid\r\nof James G. Blame, on the promise that the doctrine and practice of\r\npolygamy were to be abandoned by the Mormon Church; and he assisted in\r\nthe promulgation and acceptance of the famous \"manifesto\" of 1890,\r\nby which the Mormon Prophet, as the result of a \"divine revelation,\"\r\nwithdrew the doctrine of polygamy from the practice of the faith.\r\n\r\nHe organized the Republican party in Utah, and led it in the first\r\ncampaigns that divided the people of the territory on the lines of\r\nnational issues and freed them from the factions of a religious dispute.\r\nHe delivered to Washington the pledges of the Mormon leaders, by which\r\nthe emancipation of their people from hierarchical domination was\r\npromised and the right of statehood finally obtained. He was elected the\r\nfirst United States Senator from Utah, against the unwilling candidacy\r\nof his own father, when the intrigues of the Mormon priests pitted\r\nthe father against the son and violated the Church's promise of\r\nnon-interference in politics almost as soon as it had been given.\r\n\r\nIt was his voice, in the Senate, that helped to reawaken the national\r\nconscience to the crimes of Spanish rule in Cuba, when the \"financial\r\ninterests\" of this country were holding the government back from any\r\ninterference in Cuban affairs. He was one of the leaders in Washington\r\nof the first ill-fated \"Insurgent Republican\" movement against the\r\ncontrol of the Republican party by these same piratical \"interests;\" and\r\nhe was the only Republican Senator who stood to oppose them by voting\r\nagainst the iniquitous Dingley tariff bill of 1897. He delivered the\r\nspeech of defiance at the Republican national convention of 1896, when\r\nfour \"Silver Republican\" Senators led their delegations out of that\r\nconvention in revolt. And by all these acts of independence he put\r\nhimself in opposition to the politicians of the Mormon Church, who were\r\nallying themselves with Hanna and Aldrich, the sugar trust, the railroad\r\nlobby, and the whole financial and commercial Plunderbund in politics\r\nthat has since come to be called \"The System.\"\r\n\r\nHe returned to Utah to prevent the sale of a United States Senatorship\r\nby the Mormon Church; and, though he was himself defeated for\r\nre-election, he helped to hold the Utah legislature in a deadlock that\r\nprevented the selection of a successor to his seat. He fought to\r\ncompel the leaders of the Church to fulfill the pledges which they had\r\nauthorized him to give in Washington when statehood was being obtained.\r\nAfter his father's death, when these pledges began to be openly\r\nviolated, he directed his attack particularly against Joseph F. Smith,\r\nthe new President of the Church, who was principally responsible for the\r\nChurch's breach of public faith. Through the columns of the Salt Lake\r\nTribune he exposed the treasonable return to the practice of polygamy\r\nwhich Joseph F. Smith had secretly authorized and encouraged. He opposed\r\nthe election of Apostle Reed Smoot to the United States Senate, as\r\na violation of the statehood pledges. He criticized the financial\r\nabsolutism of the Mormon Prophet, which Smith was establishing in\r\npartnership with \"the Plunderbund.\" He was finally excommunicated and\r\nostracized, by his father's successors in power, for championing the\r\npolitical and social liberties of the Mormon people whom he had helped\r\nto save from destruction and whose statehood sovereignty he had so\r\nlargely obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen the partnership of the Church and \"the Interests\" prevented the\r\nexpulsion of Apostle Smoot from the Senate, Senator Cannon withdrew from\r\nUtah, convinced that nothing could be done for the Mormons so long as\r\nthe national administration sustained the sovereignty of the Mormon\r\nkingdom as a co-ordinate power in this Republic. For the last few years\r\nhe has been a newspaper editor in Denver, Colorado--on the Denver Times\r\nand the Rocky Mountain News--helping the reform movement in Colorado\r\nagainst the corporation control of that state, and waiting for the\r\nopportunity to renew his long fight for the Mormon people.\r\n\r\nIn the following narrative he returns to that fight. In fulfillment of\r\na promise made before he left Utah--and seeing now, in the new\r\n\"insurgency,\" the hope of freeing Utah from slavery to \"the System\"--he\r\nhere addresses himself to the task of exposing the treasons and\r\ntyrannies of the Mormon Prophet and the consequent miseries among his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his exposition, he gives a most remarkable picture\r\nof the Mormon people, patient, meek, and virtuous, \"as gentle as the\r\nQuakers, as staunch as the Jews.\" He introduces the world for the first\r\ntime to the conclaves of the Mormon ecclesiasts, explains the simplicity\r\nof some of them, the bitterness of others, the sincerity of almost\r\nall--illuminating the dark places of Church control with the\r\nunderstanding of a sympathetic experience, and bringing out the virtues\r\nof the Mormon system as impartially as he exposes its faults. He traces\r\nthe degradation of its communism, step by step and incident by incident,\r\nfrom its success as a sort of religious socialism administered for the\r\ncommon good to its present failure as a hierarchical capitalism governed\r\nfor the benefit of its modern \"Prophet of Mammon\" at the expense of the\r\nliberty, the happiness, and even the prosperity, of its victims.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the history of the Mormon Church, there has\r\narrived a man who has the knowledge and the inclination to explain it.\r\n\r\nHe does this fearlessly, as a duty, and without any apologies, as a\r\npublic right. \"He is not, and never has been an official member of the\r\nChurch, in any sense or form,\" Joseph F. Smith, as President of the\r\nChurch, testified concerning him, at Washington in 1904; and though this\r\nstatement is one of the inspired Prophet's characteristic perversions of\r\nthe truth, it covers the fact that Senator Cannon has always opposed the\r\nofficial tyrannies of the hierarchs. The present Mormon leaders accepted\r\nhis aid in freeing Utah, well aware of his independence. They profited\r\nby his success with a more or less doubtful gratitude. They betrayed him\r\npromptly--as they betrayed the nation and their own followers--as soon\r\nas they found themselves in a position safely to betray. In this book\r\nhe merely continues an independence which he has always maintained, and\r\nreplies to secret and personal treason with a public criticism, to which\r\nhe has never hesitated to resort.\r\n\r\nHe begins his story with the year 1888, and devotes the first chapters\r\nto a depiction of the miseries of the Mormon people in the unhappy\r\ndays of persecution. He continues with the private details of the\r\nconfidential negotiations in Washington and the secret conferences in\r\nSalt Lake City by which the Mormons were saved. He gives the truth about\r\nthe political intrigues that accompanied the grant of Utah's statehood,\r\nand he relates, pledge by pledge, the covenants then given by the Mormon\r\nleaders to the nation and since treasonably violated and repudiated\r\nby them. He explains the progress of this repudiation with an intimate\r\n\"inside\" knowledge of facts which the Mormon leaders now deny. And\r\nhe exposes the horror of conditions in Utah today as no other man in\r\nAmerica could expose them--for his life has been spent in combating the\r\ninfluences of which these conditions are the result; and he understands\r\nthe present situation as a doctor understands the last stages of a\r\ndisease which he has been for years vainly endeavoring to check.\r\n\r\nBut aside from all this--aside from his exposure of the Mormon\r\ndespotism, his study of the degradation of a modern community, or his\r\nsecret history of the Church's dark policies in \"sacred places\"--he\r\nrelates a story that is full of the most astonishing curiosities of\r\nhuman character and of dramatic situations that are almost mediaeval in\r\ntheir religious aspects. He goes from interviews with Cleveland or Blame\r\nto discuss American politics with men who believe themselves in direct\r\ncommunication with God--who talk and act like the patriarchs of the Old\r\nTestament--who accept their own thoughts as the inspiration of the Holy\r\nGhost, and deliver their personal decisions, reverently, as the Will\r\nof the Lord. He shows men and women ready to suffer any martyrdom in\r\ndefense of a doctrine of polygamy that is a continual unhappiness and\r\ncross upon them. He depicts the social life of the most peculiar sect\r\nthat has ever lived in a Western civilization. He writes--unconsciously,\r\nand for the first time that it has ever been written--the naive,\r\ncolossal drama of modern Mormonism.\r\n\r\nH. J. O'H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForward\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day of January, 1896, the territory of Utah was admitted\r\nto statehood, and the proscribed among its people were freed to the\r\nliberties of American citizenship, upon the solemn covenant of the\r\nleaders of the Mormon Church that they and their followers would live,\r\nthereafter, according to the laws and institutions of the nation of\r\nwhich they were allowed to become a part. And that gracious settlement\r\nof upwards of forty years of conflict was negotiated through responsible\r\nmediators, was endorsed by the good faith of the non-Mormons of Utah,\r\nand was sealed by a treaty convention in which the high contracting\r\nparties were the American Republic and the \"Kingdom of God on Earth.\"\r\n\r\nI propose, in this narrative, to show that the leaders of the Mormon\r\nChurch have broken their covenant to the nation; that they have abused\r\nthe confidence of the Gentiles of Utah and betrayed the trust of the\r\npeople under their power, by using that power to prevent the state of\r\nUtah from becoming what it had engaged to become. I propose to show\r\nthat the people of Utah, upraised to freedom by the magnanimity of the\r\nnation, are being made to appear traitorous to the generosity that\r\nsaved them; that the Mormons of Utah are being falsely misled into the\r\npeculiar dangers from which they thought they had forever escaped; that\r\nthe unity, the solidarity, the loyalty of these fervent people is being\r\nturned as a weapon of offense against the whole country, for the\r\ngreater profit of the leaders and the aggrandizement of their power. I\r\nundertake, in fact, in this narrative, to expose and to demonstrate what\r\nI do believe to be one of the most direful conspiracies of treachery in\r\nthe history of the United States.\r\n\r\nNot that I have anything in my heart against the Mormon people! Heaven\r\nforbid! I know them to be great in their virtues, wholesome in their\r\nrelations, capable of an heroic fortitude, living by the tenderest\r\nsentiments of fraternity, as gentle as the Quakers, as staunch as the\r\nJews. I think of them as a man among strangers thinks of the dearness of\r\nhis home. I am bound to them in affection by all the ties of life. The\r\nsmiles of neighborliness, the greetings of friends, all the familiar\r\ndevotion of brothers and sisters, the love of the parents who held me\r\nin their arms by these I know them as my own people, and by these I\r\nlove them as a good people, as a strong people, as a people worthy to be\r\nstrong and fit to be loved.\r\n\r\nBut it is even through their virtue and by their very strength that they\r\nare being betrayed. A human devotion--the like of which has rarely\r\nlived among the citizens of any modern state--is being directed as\r\nan instrument of subjugation against others and held as a means of\r\noppression upon the Mormons themselves. Noble when they were weak,\r\nthey are being led to ignoble purpose now that they have become strong.\r\nPraying for justice when they had no power, now that they have gained\r\npower it is being abused to ends of injustice. Their leaders, reaching\r\nfor the fleshpots for which these simple-hearted devotees have never\r\nsighed, have allied themselves with all the predaceous \"interests\" of\r\nthe country and now use the superhuman power of a religious tyranny to\r\nincrease the dividends of a national plunder.\r\n\r\nIn the long years of misery when the Mormons of Utah were proscribed and\r\nhunted, because they refused to abandon what was to them, at that, time,\r\na divine revelation and a confirmed article of faith, I sat many times\r\nin the gallery of the Senate in Washington, and heard discussed new\r\nmeasures of destruction against these victims of their own fidelity,\r\nand felt the dome above me impending like a brazen weight of national\r\nresentment upon all our heads. When, a few years later, I stood before\r\nthe President's desk in the Senate chamber, to take my oath of office\r\nas the representative of the freed people of Utah in the councils of the\r\nnation, I raised my eyes to my old seat of terror in the gallery,\r\nand pledged myself, in that remembrance, never to vote nor speak for\r\nanything but the largest measure of justice that my soul was big enough\r\nto comprehend. By such engagement I write now, bound in a double debt\r\nof obligation to the nation whose magnanimity then saved us and to the\r\npeople whom I humbly helped to save.\r\n\r\nFrank J. Cannon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER THE PROPHET IN UTAH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. In the Days of the Raid\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock one night in the spring of 1888, I set out secretly,\r\nfrom Salt Lake City, on a nine-mile drive to Bountiful, to meet my\r\nfather, who was concealed \"on the underground,\" among friends; and that\r\nnight drive, with its haste and its apprehension, was so of a piece with\r\nthe times, that I can hardly separate it from them in my memory. We were\r\nall being carried along in an uncontrollable sweep of tragic events. In\r\na sort of blindness, like the night, unable to see the nearest fork of\r\nthe road ahead of us, we were being driven to a future that held we knew\r\nnot what.\r\n\r\nI was with my brother Abraham (soon to become an apostle of the Mormon\r\nChurch), who had himself been in prison and was still in danger of\r\narrest. And there is something typical of those days in the recollection\r\nI have of him in the carriage: silent, self-contained, and--when he\r\ntalked--discussing trivialities in the most calm way in the world. The\r\nwhole district was picketed with deputy marshals; we did not know that\r\nwe were not being followed; we had always the sense of evading patrols\r\nin an enemy's country. But this feeling was so old with us that it had\r\nbecome a thing of no regard.\r\n\r\nThere was something even more typical in the personality of our\r\ndriver--a giant of a man named Charles Wilcken--a veteran of the German\r\narmy who had been decorated with the Iron Cross for bravery on the field\r\nof battle. He had come to Utah with General Johnston's forces in 1858,\r\nand had left the military service to attach himself to Brigham Young.\r\nAfter Young's death, my father had succeeded to the first place in his\r\naffections. He was an elder of the Church; he had been an aristocrat\r\nin his own country; but he forgot his every personal interest in his\r\nloyalty to his leaders, and he stood at all times ready to defend\r\nthem with his life--as a hundred thousand others did!--for, though the\r\nMormons did not resist the processes of law for themselves, except by\r\nevasion, they were prepared to protect their leaders, if necessary, by\r\nforce of arms.\r\n\r\nWith Wilcken holding the reins on a pair of fast horses at full speed,\r\nwe whirled past the old adobe wall (which the Mormons had built to\r\ndefend their city from the Indians) and came out into the purple night\r\nof Utah, with its frosty starlight and its black hills--a desert night,\r\na mountain night, a night so vast in its height of space and breadth\r\nof distance that it seemed natural it should inspire the people that\r\nbreathed it with freedom's ideals of freedom and all the sublimities of\r\nan eternal faith. And those people--!\r\n\r\nA more despairing situation than theirs, at that hour, has never been\r\nfaced by an American community. Practically every Mormon man of any\r\ndistinction was in prison, or had just served his term, or had escaped\r\ninto exile. Hundreds of Mormon women had left their homes and their\r\nchildren to flee from the officers of law; many had been behind prison\r\nbars for refusing to answer the questions put to them in court; more\r\nwere concealed, like outlaws, in the houses of friends. Husbands\r\nand wives, separated by the necessities of flight, had died apart,\r\nmiserably. Old men were coming out of prison, broken in health. A\r\nyoung plural wife whom I knew--a mere girl, of good breeding, of gentle\r\nlife--seeking refuge in the mountains to save her husband from a charge\r\nof \"unlawful cohabitation,\" had had her infant die in her arms on the\r\nroad; and she had been compelled to bury the child, wrapped in her\r\nshawl, under a rock, in a grave that she scratched in the soil with a\r\nstick. In our day! In a civilized state!\r\n\r\nBy Act of Congress, all the church property in excess of $50,000 had\r\nbeen seized by the United States marshal, and the community faced the\r\ntotal loss of its common fund. Because of some evasions that had been\r\nattempted by the Church authorities--and the suspicion of more such--the\r\nmarshal had taken everything that he could in any way assume to belong\r\nto the Church. Among the Mormons, there was an unconquerable spirit\r\nof sanctified lawlessness, and, among the non-Mormons, an equally\r\nindomitable determination to vindicate the law. Both were, for the most\r\npart, sincere. Both were resolute. And both were standing in fear of a\r\nfatal conflict, which any act of violence might begin.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Mormons were being slowly but surely deprived of all civil\r\nrights. All polygamists had been disfranchised by the bill of 1882, and\r\nall the women of Utah by the bill of 1887. The Governor of the territory\r\nwas appointed by Federal authority, so was the marshal, so were the\r\njudges, so were the United States Commissioners who had co-ordinate\r\njurisdiction with magistrates and justices of the peace, so were\r\nthe Election Commissioners. But the Mormons still controlled the\r\nlegislature, and though the Governor could veto all legislation he could\r\ninitiate none. For this reason it had been frequently proposed that the\r\nPresident should appoint a Legislative Council to take the place of\r\nthe elected legislature; and bills were being talked of in Congress\r\nto effect a complete disfranchisement of the whole body of the Mormon\r\npeople by means of a test oath.\r\n\r\nI did not then believe, and I do not now, that the practice of polygamy\r\nwas a thing which the American nation could condone. But I knew that our\r\npeople believed in it as a practice ordained, by a revelation from God,\r\nfor the salvation of the world. It was to them an article of faith as\r\nsacred as any for which the martyrs of any religion ever died; and it\r\nseemed that the nation, in its resolve to vindicate the supremacy of\r\ncivil government, was determined to put them to the point of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nIt was with this prospect before us that we drove, that night, up the\r\nSalt Lake valley, across a corner of the desert, to the little town of\r\nBountiful; and as soon as we arrived among the houses of the settlement,\r\na man stepped out into the road, from the shadows, and stopped us.\r\nWilcken spoke to him. He recognized us, and let us pass. As we turned\r\ninto the farm where my father was concealed, I saw men lurking here and\r\nthere, on guard, about the grounds. The house was an old-fashioned adobe\r\nfarm-house; the windows were all dark; we entered through the kitchen.\r\nAnd I entered, let me say, with the sense that I was about to come\r\nbefore one of the most able among men.\r\n\r\nTo those who knew George Q. Cannon I do not need to justify that\r\nfeeling. He was the man in the hands of whose sagacity the fate of the\r\nMormons at that moment lay. He was the First Councillor of the Church,\r\nand had been so for years. For ten years in Congress, he had fought and\r\ndefeated the proscriptive legislation that had been attempted against\r\nhis people; and Senator Hoar had said of him, \"No man in Congress\r\never served a territory more ably.\" He had been the intimate friend of\r\nRandall and Blame. As a missionary in England he had impressed Dickens,\r\nwho wrote of him in \"An Uncommercial Traveller.\" The Hon. James Bryce\r\nhad said of him: \"He was one of the ablest Americans I ever met.\"\r\n\r\nAn Englishman, well-educated, a linguist, an impressive orator, a\r\npersuasive writer, he had lived a life that was one long incredible\r\nadventure of romance and almost miraculous achievement. As a youth he\r\nhad been sent by the Mormon leaders to California to wash out gold for\r\nthe struggling community; and he had sent back to Utah all the proceeds\r\nof his labor, living himself upon the crudest necessaries of life. As\r\na young man he had gone as a Mormon missionary to the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nand finding himself unable to convert the whites he had gone among the\r\nnatives--starving, a ragged wanderer--and by simple force of personality\r\nhe had made himself a power among them; so that in later years Napella,\r\nthe famous native leader, journeyed to Utah to consult with him upon the\r\naffairs of that distressed state, and Queen Liluokalani, deposed and in\r\nexile, appealed to him for advice. He had edited and published a Mormon\r\nnewspaper in San Francisco; and he had long successfully directed the\r\naffairs of the publishing house in Salt Lake City which he owned. He\r\nwas a railroad builder, a banker, a developer of mines, a financier of\r\na score of interests. He combined the activities of a statesman, a\r\nmissionary, and a man of business, and seemed equally successful in all.\r\n\r\nBut none of these things--nor all of them--contained the total of the\r\nman himself. He was greater than his work. He achieved by the force of\r\na personality that was more impressive than its achievements. If he had\r\nbeen royalty, he could not have been surrounded with a greater deference\r\nthan he commanded among our people. A feeling of responsibility for\r\nthose dependent on him, such as a king might feel, added to a sense of\r\ndivine guidance that gave him the dignity of inspiration, had made him\r\nmajestical in his simple presence; and even among those who laughed at\r\ndivine inspiration and scorned Mormonism as the *Uitlander scorned the\r\nfaith of the Boer, his sagacity and his diplomacy and his power to read\r\nand handle men made him as fearfully admired as any Oom Paul in the\r\nTransvaal.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the low-ceilinged, lamplit room in which he sat, he rose\r\nto meet me, and all rose with him, like a court. He embraced me without\r\neffusion, looking at me silently with his wise blue eyes that always\r\nseemed to read in my face--and to check up in his valuation of\r\nme--whatever I had become in my absence from his regard.\r\n\r\nHe had a countenance that at no time bore any of the marks of the\r\npassions of men; and it showed, now, no shadow of the tribulations of\r\nthat troubled day. His forehead was unworried. His eyes betrayed none of\r\nthe anxieties with which his mind must have been busied. His expression\r\nwas one of resolute stern contentment with all things--carrying the\r\ncomposure of spirit which he wished his people to have. If I had been\r\nagitated by the urgency of his summons to me, and he had wished to allay\r\nmy anxiety at once, the sight of his face, as he looked at me, would\r\nhave been reassurance enough.\r\n\r\nAt a characteristic motion of the hand from him, the others left us.\r\nWe sat down in the \"horsehair\" chairs of a well-to-do farmer's\r\nparlor--furnished in black walnut, with the usual organ against one\r\nwall, and the usual marble-topped bureau against the other. I remember\r\nthe \"store\" carpet, the mortuary hair-wreaths on the walls, the\r\nwalnut-framed lithographs of the Church authorities and of the angel\r\nMoroni with \"the gold plates;\" and none of these seem ludicrous to me to\r\nremember. They express, to me, in the recollection, some of the homely\r\nand devout simplicity of the people whose community life this man was to\r\nsave.\r\n\r\nHe talked a few minutes, affectionately, about family matters, and\r\nthen--straightening his shoulders to the burden of more gravity--he\r\nsaid: \"I have sent for you, my son, to see if you cannot find some way\r\nto help us in our difficulties. I have made it a matter of prayer, and\r\nI have been led to urge you to activity. You have never performed a\r\nMission for the Church, and I have sometimes wondered if you cared\r\nanything about your religion. You have never obeyed the celestial\r\ncovenant, and you have kept yourself aloof from the duties of the\r\npriesthood, but it may have been a providential overruling. I have\r\ntalked with some of the brethren, and we feel that if relief does not\r\nsoon appear, our community will be scattered and the great work crushed.\r\nThe Lord can rescue us, but we must put forth our own efforts. Can you\r\nsee any light?\"\r\n\r\nI replied that I had already been in Washington twice, on my own\r\ninitiative, conferring with some of his Congressional friends. \"I am\r\nstill,\" I said, \"of the opinion I expressed to you and President Taylor\r\nfour years ago. Plural marriage must be abandoned or our friends in\r\nWashington will not defend us.\"\r\n\r\nFour years before, when I had offered that opinion, President Taylor\r\nhad cried out: \"No! Plural marriage is the will of God! It's apostasy to\r\nquestion it!\" And I paused now with the expectation that my father would\r\nsay something of this sort. But, as I was afterwards to observe, it was\r\npart of his diplomacy, in conference, to pass the obvious opportunity of\r\nreplying, and to remain silent when he was expected to speak, so that\r\nhe might not be in the position of following the lead of his opponent's\r\nargument, but rather, by waiting his own time, be able to direct the\r\nconversation to his own purposes. He listened to me, silently, his eyes\r\nfixed on my face.\r\n\r\n\"Senator Vest of Missouri,\" I went on, \"has always been a strong\r\nopponent of what he considered unconstitutional legislation against us,\r\nbut he tells me he'll no longer oppose proscription if we continue in\r\nan attitude of defiance. He says you're putting yourselves beyond\r\nassistance, by organized rebellion against the administration of the\r\nstatutes.\" And I continued with instances of others among his friends\r\nwho had spoken to the same purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done, he took what I had said with a gesture that at once\r\naccepted and for the moment dismissed it; and he proceeded to a larger\r\nconsideration of the situation, in words which I cannot pretend to\r\nrecall, but to an effect which I wish to outline--because it not only\r\naccounts for the preservation of the Mormon people from all their\r\ndangers, but contains a reason why the world might have wished to see\r\nthem preserved.\r\n\r\nThe Mormons at this time had never written a line on social\r\nreform--except as the so-called \"revelations\" established a new social\r\norder--but they had practiced whole volumes. Their community was founded\r\non the three principles of co-operation, contribution, and arbitration.\r\nBy co-operation of effort they had realized that dream of the\r\nSocialists, \"equality of opportunity\"--not equality of individual\r\ncapacity, which the accidents of nature prevent, but an equal\r\nopportunity for each individual to develop himself to the last reach of\r\nhis power. By contribution by requiring each man to give one-tenth of\r\nhis income to a common fund--they had attained the desired end of modern\r\ncivilization, the abolition of poverty, and had adjusted the straps of\r\nthe community burden to the strength of the individual to bear it. By\r\narbitration, they had effected the settlement of every dispute of every\r\nkind without litigation; for their High Councils decided all sorts\r\nof personal or neighborhood disputes without expense of money to the\r\ndisputants. The \"storehouse of the Lord\" had been kept open to fill\r\nevery need of the poor among \"God's people,\" and opportunities for self\r\nhelp had been created out of the common fund, so that neither unwilling\r\nidleness nor privation might mar the growth of the community or the\r\nprogress of the individual.\r\n\r\nBut Joseph Smith had gone further. Daring to believe himself the earthly\r\nrepresentative of Omnipotence, whose duty it was to see that all had the\r\nrights to which he thought them entitled, and assuming that a woman's\r\nchief right was that of wifehood and maternity, he had instituted the\r\npractice of plural marriage, as a \"Prophet of God,\" on the authority of\r\na direct revelation from the Almighty. It was upon this rock that the\r\nwhole enterprise, the whole experiment in religious communism, now\r\nthreatened to split. Not that polygamy was so large an incident in the\r\nlife of the community--for only a small proportion of the Mormons were\r\nliving in plural marriage. And not that this practice was the cardinal\r\nsin of Mormonism--for among intelligent men, then as now, the great\r\nobjection to the Church was its assumption of a divine authority to hold\r\nthe \"temporal power,\" to dictate in politics, to command action and\r\nto acquit of responsibility. But polygamy was the offense against\r\ncivilization which the opponents of Mormonism could always cite in\r\norder to direct against the Church the concentrated antagonism of the\r\ngovernments of the Western world. And my father, in authorizing me to\r\nproceed to Washington as a sort of ambassador of the Church, evidently\r\nwished to impress upon me the larger importance of the value of the\r\nsocial experiment which the Mormons had, to this time, so successfully\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\n\"It would be a cruel waste of human effort,\" he said, \"if, after having\r\nattained comfort in these valleys--established our schools of art and\r\nscience--developed our country and founded our industries--we should now\r\nbe destroyed as a community, and the value of our experience lost to the\r\nworld. We have a right to survive. We have a duty to survive. It would\r\nbe to the profit of the nation that we should survive.\"\r\n\r\nBut in order to survive, it was necessary to obtain some immediate\r\nmitigation of the enforcement of the laws against us. The manner in\r\nwhich they were being enforced was making compromise impossible, and\r\nthe men who administered them stood in the way of getting a favorable\r\nhearing from the powers of government that alone could authorize a\r\ncompromise. It was necessary to break this circle; and my father went\r\nover the names of the men in Washington who might help us. I could\r\nmarvel at his understanding of these men and their motives, but we came\r\nto no plan of action until I spoke of what had been with me a sort of\r\nforlorn hope that I might appeal to President Cleveland himself.\r\n\r\nMy father said thoughtfully: \"What influence could you, a Republican,\r\nhave with him? It's true that your youth may make an appeal--and the\r\nfact that you're pleading for your relatives, while not yourself a\r\npolygamist. But he would immediately ask us to abandon plural marriage,\r\nand that is established by a revelation from God which we cannot\r\ndisregard. Even if the Prophet directed us, as a revelation from God, to\r\nabandon polygamy, still the nation would have further cause for quarrel\r\nbecause of the Church's temporal rule. No. I can make no promise. I can\r\nauthorize no pledge. It must be for the Prophet of God to say what is\r\nthe will of the Lord. You must see President Woodruff, and after he has\r\nasked for the will of the Lord I shall be content with his instruction.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I do not wish to say--though I did then believe it--that the First\r\nCouncillor of the Mormon Church was prepared to have the doctrine of\r\nplural marriage abandoned in order to have the people saved. It is\r\nimpossible to predicate the thoughts of a man so diplomatic, so astute,\r\nand at the same time so deeply religious and so credulous of all the\r\nmiracles of faith. He did believe in Divine guidance. He was sincere\r\nin his submission to the \"revelations\" of the Prophet. But, in the\r\ncomplexity of the mind of man, even such a faith may be complicated with\r\nthe strategies of foresight, and the priest who bows devoutly to the\r\noracle may yet, even unconsciously, direct the oracle to the utterance\r\nof his desire. And if my father was--as I suspected--considering a\r\nrecession from plural marriage, he had as justification the basic\r\n\"revelation,\" given through \"Joseph the Prophet,\" commanding that the\r\npeople should hold themselves in subjection to the government under\r\nwhich they lived, \"until He shall come Whose right it is to rule.\"\r\n\r\nWe talked till midnight, in the quiet glow of the farmer's lamp-light,\r\ndiscussing possibilities, considering policies, weighing men; and then\r\nwe parted--he to betake himself to whatever secure place of hiding\r\nhe had found, and I to return to Ogden where I was then editing a\r\nnewspaper. I was only twenty-nine years old, and the responsibility\r\nof the undertaking that had been entrusted to me weighed on my mind. I\r\nwaited for a summons to confer with President Woodruff, but none came.\r\nInstead, my brother brought me word from the President that I must be\r\n\"guided by the spirit of the Lord;\" and, finally, my father sent me\r\norders to consult the Second Councillor, Joseph F. Smith.\r\n\r\nJoseph F. Smith! Since the death of the founder of the Mormon Church,\r\nthere have been three men pre-eminent in its history: Brigham Young,\r\nwho led the people across the desert into the Salt Lake Valley and\r\nestablished them in prosperity there; George Q. Cannon, who directed\r\ntheir policies and secured their national rights; and Joseph F. Smith,\r\nwho today rules over that prosperity and markets that political right,\r\nlike a Sultan. Of all these, Smith is, to the nation now, of most\r\nimportance--and sinisterly so.\r\n\r\nNo Mormon in those years, I think, had more hate than Smith for the\r\nUnited States government; and surely none had better reasons to give\r\nhimself for hate. He had the bitter recollection of the assassination\r\nof his father and his uncle in the jail of Carthage, Illinois; he could\r\nremember the journey that he had made with his widowed mother across the\r\nMississippi, across Iowa, across the Missouri, and across the unknown\r\nand desert West, in ox teams, half starved, unarmed, persecuted by\r\ncivilization and at the mercy of savages; he could remember all the\r\ntoils and hardships of pioneer days \"in the Valley;\" he had seen the\r\narmy of '58 arrive to complete, as he believed, the final destruction\r\nof our people; he had suffered from all the proscriptive legislation of\r\n\"the raid,\" been outlawed, been in exile, been in hiding, hunted like a\r\nthief. He had been taught, and he firmly believed, that the Smiths had\r\nbeen divinely appointed to rule, in the name of God, over all mankind.\r\nHe believed that he--ordained a ruler over this world before ever the\r\nworld was--had been persecuted by the hate and wickedness of men. He\r\nbelieved it literally; he preached it literally; he still believes and\r\nstill preaches it. I did not then sympathize with this point of view,\r\nany more than I do now; but I did sympathize with him in the hardships\r\nthat he had already endured and in the trials that he was still\r\nenduring--in common with the rest of us. The bond of community\r\npersecution intensified my loyalty. I felt for him almost as I felt for\r\nmy own father. I went to him with the young man's trust in age made wise\r\nby suffering.\r\n\r\nI had been directed to call on him in the President's offices, in Salt\r\nLake City, where he was concealed, for the moment, under the name of\r\n\"Mack\"--the name that he used \"on the underground\"--and I went with my\r\nbrother, late at night, to see him there. The President's offices were\r\nat that time in a little one-story plastered house that had been built\r\nby Brigham Young between two of his famous residences, the \"Beehive\r\nHouse\" and the \"Lion House\" (in which some twelve or fourteen of his\r\nwives had lived). The three houses were within the enclosure of a high\r\ncobblestone wall built by Brigham Young; and at night the great gate of\r\nthe wall was shut and locked. We hammered discreetly on its panels\r\nof mountain pine, until a guard answered our knocking, recognized our\r\nvoices and admitted us.\r\n\r\n\"He's in there,\" he said, pointing to the darkened windows of the\r\noffices--toward which he led us.\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the front door--having evidently locked it when he went to\r\nthe gate--and he explained to a waiting attendant: \"These brethren have\r\nan appointment. They wish to see Brother Mack.\"\r\n\r\nThe attendant led us down a dimly-lighted hall, through the public\r\noffices of the President into a rear room, a sort of retiring room,\r\ncarpeted, furnished with bookcases, chairs, a table. The window blinds\r\nhad all been carefully drawn.\r\n\r\nJoseph F. Smith was waiting for us--a tall, lean, long-bearded man of\r\na commanding figure standing as if our arrival had stopped him in some\r\nanxious pacing of the carpet. His overcoat and his hat had been thrown\r\non a chair. He greeted us with the air of one who is hurried, and sat\r\ndown tentatively; and as soon as we came to the question of my trip to\r\nWashington, he broke out:\r\n\r\n\"These scoundrels here must be removed--if there's any way to do it.\r\nThey're trying to repeat the persecutions of Missouri and Illinois. They\r\nwant to despoil us of our heritage--of our families. I'm sick of being\r\nhunted like a wild beast. I've done no harm to them or theirs. Why can't\r\nthey leave us alone to live our religion and obey the commandments of\r\nGod and build up Zion?\" He had begun to stride up and down the floor\r\nagain, in a sort of driven and angry helplessness. \"I thought Cleveland\r\nwould stop this damnable raid and make them leave us in peace--but he's\r\nas bad as the rest. Can't they see that these carpet baggers are only\r\ntrying to rob us? Make them see that. The hounds! Sometimes it seems to\r\nme that the Lord is letting these iniquities go on so that the nation\r\nmay perish in its sins all the sooner!\"\r\n\r\nHe sneered at John W. Young who had gone to Washington for the Church.\r\n(I had met Smith himself there, earlier in the year.) \"I thought\r\nhe'd accomplish something,\" he said, \"with his fashionable home and\r\nhis--[**missing text?**] He's using money enough! He's down there,\r\ntaking things easy, while the rest of us are driven from pillar to\r\npost.\" He attacked the Federal authorities, Governor West, the \"whole\r\ngang.\" He cried: \"I love my wives and my children--whom the Lord\r\ngave me. I love them more than my life--more than anything in the\r\nworld--except my religion! And here I am, fleeing from place to place,\r\nfrom the wrath of the wicked--and they're left in sorrow and suffering.\"\r\n\r\nHis face was pallid with emotion, and his voice came now hard with\r\nexasperation against his enemies and now husky with a passionate\r\naffection for his family--a man of fifty, graybearded, quivering in a\r\nnervous transport of excitement that jerked him up and down the room,\r\ngesticulating.\r\n\r\nWhen he had worn out his first anger of revolt, I brought the\r\nconversation round to the question of polygamy, by asking him about a\r\nprovisional constitution for statehood which the non-polygamous\r\nMormons had recently adopted. It contained a clause making polygamy a\r\nmisdemeanor. \"I would have seen them all damned,\" he said, \"before I\r\nwould have yielded it, but I'm willing to try the experiment, if any\r\ngood can come.\"\r\n\r\nHe had, I gathered, no aversion to \"deceiving the wicked,\" but he was\r\nopposed to leading his people away from their loyalty to the doctrine of\r\nplural marriage, by conceding anything that might weaken their faith in\r\nit. And yet this impression may misrepresent him. He was too agitated,\r\ntoo exasperated, for any serious reflection on the situation.\r\n\r\nMy brother had gone--to keep some other engagement--and I stayed late,\r\ntalking as long as Smith seemed to wish to talk. He rose at last and\r\n\"blessed\" me, his hands on my head, in a return to some larger trust in\r\nhis religious authority; and I left him--with very doubtful and mixed\r\nemotions. His natural violence and his lack of discipline had been\r\nmatters of common gossip among our people, and I had heard of them from\r\nchildhood; but I had supposed that tribulations would, by this time,\r\nhave matured him. There was something compelling in his unsoftened\r\nturbulence, but nothing encouraging for me as a messenger of\r\nconciliation. I felt that there would be no help come from him in my\r\ntask, and I dropped him from my reckoning.\r\n\r\nI had made up my mind to a plan that was almost as desperate as the\r\nconditions it sought to cure--a plan that was in some ways so absurd\r\nthat I felt like keeping it concealed for fear of ridicule--and I went\r\nabout my preparations for departure in a sort of hopeless hope. As the\r\ntrain drew out from Ogden, I looked back at the mountains from my car\r\nwindow, and saw again, in the spectacle of their power, the pathos of\r\nour people--as if it were the nation of my worship that bulked there\r\nso huge above the people of my love--and I, puny in my little efforts,\r\ngoing out to plot an intercession, to appeal for a truce! It was almost\r\nas if I were the son of a Confederate leader journeying to Washington,\r\non the eve of the Civil War, to attempt to stand between North and South\r\nand hold back their opposing armies, single-handed.\r\n\r\nThese are the things a man does when he is young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. On A Mission to Washington\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI went discredited, as an envoy, by an incident of personal conflict\r\nwith the Federal authorities; and I wish to relate that incident before\r\nI proceed any farther. I must relate it soon, because it came up for\r\nexplanation in one of my first interviews with President Cleveland; and\r\nI wish to relate it now, because it was so typical of the day and the\r\ncondition from which we had to save ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1885-6, the United States Marshals had been pursuing my\r\nfather from place to place with such determined persistence that it was\r\nevident his capture was only a matter of time. We believed that if\r\nhe were arrested and tried before Chief Justice Zane--with District\r\nAttorney Dickson and Assistant District Attorney Varian prosecuting--he\r\nwould be convicted on so many counts that he would be held in prison\r\nindefinitely--that he might, in fact, end his days there. There was\r\nthe rumor of a boast, to this effect, made by Federal officers; and we\r\nmisunderstood them and their motives, in those days, sufficiently to\r\naccept the unjust report as well-founded.\r\n\r\nMy father, as First Councillor of the Church, had proposed to President\r\nTaylor that every man who was living in plural marriage should surrender\r\nhimself voluntarily to the court and plead: \"I entered into this\r\ncovenant of celestial marriage with a personal conviction that it was an\r\norder revealed by our Father in Heaven for the salvation of mankind. I\r\nhave kept my covenant in purity. I believed that no constitutional law\r\nof the country could forbid this practice of a religious faith. As the\r\nlaws of Congress conflict with my sense of submission to the will of the\r\nLord, I now offer myself, here, for whatever judgment the courts of my\r\ncountry may impose.\" He believed that such a course would vindicate the\r\nsincerity of the men who had engaged in polygamy and defied the law\r\nin an assumption of religious immunity; and he believed that the world\r\nwould pause to reconsider its judgment upon us, if it saw thousands\r\nof men--the bankers, the farmers, the merchants, and all the religious\r\nleaders of a civilized community--marching in a mass to perform such an\r\nact of faith.\r\n\r\nBut President Taylor was not prepared for a movement that would have\r\nrecommended itself better to the daring genius of Brigham Young. Taylor\r\nhad given himself into the custody of the officers of the law once--in\r\nCarthage, Illinois--with Joseph Smith and his brother, Hyrum Smith; and\r\nTaylor had been wounded by the mob that broke into the jail and shot\r\nthe Smiths to death. This, perhaps, had cured him of any faith in the\r\nprotecting power of innocency. He decided against voluntary surrender;\r\nand now that my father's liberty was so seriously threatened, he ordered\r\nhim to go either to Mexico or to the Sandwich Islands--his old\r\nmission field--where he would be beyond the reach of the United States\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nMy father believed that if he left Utah, his recession might tend to\r\nplacate the government and soften the severity of the prosecutions of\r\nthe Mormons; and accordingly, on the night of February 12, 1886, he\r\nboarded a west-bound Central Pacific train at Willard. The Federal\r\nofficers in some way learned of it; he was arrested, on the train, at\r\nHumboldt Wells, Nevada, and brought back to Utah. Near Promontory he\r\nfell from the steps of the moving car, at night, in the midst of an\r\nalkali desert, and hurt himself seriously. He was recaptured and brought\r\nto Salt Lake City on a stretcher, in a special car, guarded by a squad\r\nof soldiers from Fort Douglas, with loaded muskets, and a captain with\r\na conspicuous sword. He was taken to Judge Zane's chambers and placed\r\nunder bonds of $25,000. Immediately two bench warrants were issued by a\r\nUnited States Commissioner, and these were served upon him while he lay\r\non a mattress on the floor of Zane's office. Two more bonds of $10,000\r\neach were given. He was then taken to his home.\r\n\r\nLater--(President Taylor still insisting that he must not stand\r\ntrial)--he disappeared again, \"on the underground,\" and his bonds\r\nwere declared forfeited. But in the meantime, while the grand jury was\r\nhearing testimony against him, one of the beloved women of his family\r\nwas called for examination, and District Attorney Dickson asked her\r\nsome questions that deeply wounded her. She returned home weeping. My\r\nbrothers and I felt that the questions had been needlessly offensive,\r\nand after an indignant discussion of the matter, I undertook to\r\nremonstrate personally with Mr. Dickson.\r\n\r\nIf I had been as wise, then, as I sometimes think I am now, I should\r\nhave realized that a meeting between us was dangerous; that the feeling,\r\non our side at least, was too warm for calm remonstrances. And I should\r\nnot have taken with me a younger brother, about sixteen years old, with\r\nall the hot-headedness of youth. Fortunately we did not go armed.\r\n\r\nWe sought Dickson in the evening, at the Continental Hotel--the old,\r\nadobe Continental with its wide porches and its lawn trees--and we found\r\nhim in the lobby. I asked him to step out on the porch, where I might\r\nspeak with him in private. He came without a moment's hesitation. He was\r\na big, handsome, black-bearded man in the prime of his strength.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely exchanged more than a few sentences formally, when my\r\nbrother drew back and struck him a smashing blow in the face. Dickson\r\ngrappled with me, a little blinded, and I called to the boy to\r\nrun--which he very wisely did. Dickson and I were at once surrounded,\r\nand I was arrested.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the incident would have been trivial enough, but in the\r\nalarmed state of the public mind it was magnified into an attempt on the\r\npart of George Q. Cannon's sons to take the life of the United States\r\nDistrict Attorney. Indictments were found against my brother and myself,\r\nand against a cousin who happened to be in another part of the hotel at\r\nthe time of the attack. Some weeks later, when the excitement had rather\r\ndied down, I went to the District Attorney's office and arranged with\r\nhis assistant, Mr. Varian, that the indictments against my brother (who\r\nhad escaped from Utah) and my cousin (who was wholly innocent) should\r\nbe quashed, and that I should plead guilty to a charge of assault and\r\nbattery. On this understanding, I appeared in court before Chief Justice\r\nZane.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Varian, having consulted with Mr. Dickson, had learned that I\r\nhad not struck the blow--though, as the elder brother, I was morally\r\nresponsible for it--and he suggested to the court that sentence be\r\nsuspended. This, Justice Zane seemed prepared to do, but I objected. I\r\nwas a newspaper writer (as I explained), and I felt that if I criticized\r\nthe court thereafter for what I believed to be a harshness that amounted\r\nto persecution, I could be silenced by the imposition of the suspended\r\nsentence; and if I failed to criticize, I should be false to what I\r\nconsidered my duty. I did not wish to be put in any such position; and I\r\nsaid so.\r\n\r\nJustice Zane had a respect for the constitution and the statutes that\r\namounted to a creed of infallibility. He was the most superbly rigid\r\npontiff of legal justice that I ever knew. A man of unspotted character,\r\na Puritan, of a sincerity that was afterwards accepted and admired\r\nfrom end to end of Utah, he was determined to vindicate the essential\r\nsupremacy of the civil law over the ecclesiastical domination in\r\nthe territory; and every act of insubordination against that law was\r\nresented and punished by him, unforgivingly. He promptly sentenced me to\r\nthree months in the County jail and a fine of $150.\r\n\r\nMy imprisonment was, of course, a farce. I was merely confined, most of\r\nthe time, in a room in the County Court House, where I lived and worked\r\nas if I were in my home. But the sentence remained on my record as a\r\nsufficient mark of my recalcitrance; and I knew that it would not aid me\r\nin my appeal to Washington, where I intended to argue--as the first wise\r\nconcession needed of the Federal authorities--that Chief Justice\r\nZane should no longer be retained on the bench in Utah, but should\r\nbe succeeded by a man more gentle. He was the great figure among our\r\nprosecutors; the others were District Attorney Dickson and the two\r\nassistants, Mr. Varian and Mr. Riles. The square had only seemed to\r\nbe broken by the recent retirement of Mr. Dickson; the strength of his\r\npurpose remained still in power, in the person of Judge Zane.\r\n\r\nAnd let me say that whatever my opinion was of these men, at that time,\r\nI recognize now that they were justified as officers of the law in\r\nenforcing the law. If it had not been for them, the Mormon Church\r\nwould never have been brought to the point of abating one jot of its\r\npretensions. All four men, as their records have since proved, were much\r\nsuperior to their positions as territorial officers. Utah's admiration\r\nfor Judge Zane was shown, upon the composition of our differences with\r\nthe nation, by the Mormon vote that placed him on the Supreme\r\nCourt bench. Indeed, it is one of the strange psychologies of this\r\nreconciliation, that, as soon as peace was made, the strongest men of\r\nboth parties came into the warmest friendship; our fear and hatred\r\nof our prosecutors changed to respect; and their opposition to our\r\nindissoluble solidarity changed to regard when they saw us devoting our\r\nstrength to purposes of which they could approve. But now, in the midst\r\nof our contentions, the aspect of splendor in their legal authority had\r\nsomething baleful in it, for us; and we saw our own defiance set with a\r\nhalo of martyrdom and illumined by the radiance of a Church oppressed!\r\n\r\nThere was more than a glimmer of that radiance in my thoughts as I made\r\nthe railroad journey from Utah to the East. The Union Pacific Railway,\r\non which I rode, followed the route that the Mormons had taken in their\r\nlong trek from the Missouri; and I could look from my car window and\r\nimagine them toiling across those endless plains--in their creaking\r\nwagons, drawn by their oxen and lean farm cows--choked with dust, burned\r\nby the sun of the prairies, their faces to the unknown dangers of an\r\nunknown wilderness, and behind them the cool-roomed houses, the moist\r\nfields, the tree-shaded streets, all the quiet and comfort of the\r\nsettled life of homekeeping happiness that they had left. My own mother\r\nhad come that road, a little girl of eight; and my mind was full of\r\npictures of her, at school in a wagon-box, singing hymns with her elders\r\naround the camp fires at night, or kneeling with the mourners beside the\r\ngrave of an infant relative buried by the roadside. Our train crossed\r\nthe Loup Fork of the Platte almost within sight of the place where my\r\nfather, a lad of twenty, had led across the river at nightfall, had been\r\nlost to his party, and had nearly perished, naked to the cold, before\r\nhe struggled back to the camp. I could see their little circle of wagons\r\ndrawn up at sunset against the menace of the Indians who snaked through\r\nthe long grass to kill. I could feel some of their despair, and my heart\r\nlifted to their heroism. Never had such a migration been made by any\r\npeople with fewer of the concomitants of their civilization. Their arms\r\nhad been taken from them at Nauvoo; they had bartered their goods for\r\nwagons and cattle to carry them; even the grain that they brought,\r\nfor food, had to be saved for seed. They felt themselves devoted to\r\ndestruction by the people with whose laws and institutions they had come\r\nin conflict, and they went forth bravely, trusting in the power of the\r\nGod whom they were determined to worship according to their despised\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nNow they had built themselves new homes and meeting-houses in the\r\nfertile \"Valley;\" and the civilization that they had left, having\r\ncovered the distance of their exile, was punishing them again for their\r\nlaw-breaking fidelity to their faith. Surely they had suffered enough!\r\nSurely it was evident that suffering only made them strong to resist!\r\nSurely there must be somebody in power in Washington who could be\r\npersuaded to see that, where force had always failed, there might be\r\nsome profit in employing gentleness!\r\n\r\nThis, at least, was the appeal which I had planned to make. And I had\r\ndecided to make it through Mr. Abraham S. Hewitt, then mayor of New\r\nYork City, who had been a friend of my father in Congress. He was not\r\nin favor with the administration at Washington. He was personally\r\nunfriendly to President Cleveland. I was a stranger to him. But I had\r\nseen enough of him to know that he had the heart to hear a plea\r\non behalf of the Mormons, and the brain to help me carry that plea\r\ndiplomatically to President Cleveland.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in New York I set about finding him without the aid of\r\nany common friend. I did not try to reach him at his home, being aware\r\nthat he might resent an intrusion of public matters upon his private\r\nleisure, and fearing to impair my own confidence by beginning with a\r\nrebuff. I decided to see him in his office hours.\r\n\r\nI cannot recall why I did not find him in the municipal buildings, but I\r\nwell remember going to and fro in the streets in search of him, feeling\r\nat every step the huge city's absorption in its own press and hurry of\r\naffairs, and seeing the troubles of Utah as distant as a foreign war.\r\nIt was with a very keen sense of discouragement that I took my place, at\r\nlast, in the long line of applicants waiting for a word with the man\r\nwho directed the municipal activities of this tremendous hive of eager\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nHe was in the old Stewart building, on Broadway, near Park Place; and\r\nhe had his desk in what was, I think, a temporary office--an empty shop\r\nused as an office--on the ground floor. There must have been fifty men\r\nahead of me, and they were the unemployed, as I remember it, besieging\r\nhim for work. They came to his desk, spoke, and passed with a rapidity\r\nthat was ominous. As I drew nearer, I watched him anxiously, and saw\r\nthe incessant, nervous, querulous activity of eyes, lips, hands, as\r\nhe dismissed each with a word or a scratch of the pen, and looked up\r\nsharply at the next one.\r\n\r\n\"Well, young man,\" he greeted me, \"what do you want?\"\r\n\r\nI replied: \"I want a half hour of your time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God,\" he said, in a sort of reproachful indignation, \"I couldn't\r\ngive it to the President of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nI felt the crowd of applicants pressing behind me. I knew the man's\r\nprodigious humanity. I knew that if I could only hold them back long\r\nenough--\"Mr. Hewitt,\" I said, \"it's more important even than that. It's\r\nto save a whole people from suffering--from destruction.\"\r\n\r\nHe may have thought me a maniac; or it may be that the desperation of\r\nthe moment sounded in my voice. He frowned intently up at me. \"Who are\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm the son of your old friend in Congress, George Q. Cannon of Utah,\"\r\nI said. \"My father's in exile. He and his people are threatened with\r\nendless proscriptions. I want time to tell you.\"\r\n\r\nHis impatience had vanished. His eyes were steadily kind and interested.\r\n\"Can you come to the Board of Health, in an hour? As soon as I open the\r\nmeeting, I'll retire and listen to you.\"\r\n\r\nI asked him for a card, to admit me to the meeting, having been\r\nstopped that morning at many doors. He gave it, nodded, and flashed his\r\nattention on the man behind me. I went out with the heady assurance that\r\nmy first move had succeeded; but I went, too, with the restrained pulse\r\nof realizing that I had yet to join issue with the decisive event and do\r\nit warily.\r\n\r\nI do not remember where I found the Board of Health in session. I recall\r\nonly the dark, official board-room, the members at the table,\r\nand--as the one small spot of light and interest to me--Mr. Hewitt's\r\nwhite-bearded face, as an attendant opened the door to me, and the\r\nMayor, looking up alertly, nodded across the room, and waved his hand to\r\na chair.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had opened the meeting, we withdrew together to a settee\r\nin some remote corner, and I began to tell him, as quickly as I could,\r\nthe desperateness of the Mormon situation. \"Yes,\" he said, \"but why\r\ncan't your people obey the law?\"\r\n\r\nI explained what I have been trying to explain in this narrative--that\r\nthese people, following a Church which they believed to be guided by\r\nGod, and regarding themselves as objects of a religious persecution,\r\ncould not be brought by means of force to obey a law against conscience.\r\nI explained that I was not pleading to save their pride but to spare\r\nthem useless suffering; their history showed that no proscription, short\r\nof extermination outright, could overcome their resistance; but what\r\nforce could not accomplish, a little sensible diplomacy might hope to\r\neffect. No first step could be made, by them, towards a composition of\r\ntheir differences with the law so long as the law was administered\r\nwith a hostility that provoked hostility. But if we could obtain some\r\nmitigation of the law's severity, the leaders of the Church were willing\r\nto surrender themselves to the court--such of them as had not already\r\ndied of their privations or served their terms of imprisonment--and a\r\nsense of gratitude for leniency would prepare the way for a recession\r\nfrom their present attitude of unconquerable antagonism.\r\n\r\nHe listened gravely, knowing the situation from his own experience\r\nin Congress, and checking off the items of my argument with a nod of\r\nacceptance that came, often, before I had completed what I had to say.\r\nHe asked: \"Do you know President Cleveland?\"\r\n\r\nI told him that I had seen the President several times but was not known\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I may be able to help you indirectly. I don't care\r\nfor Cleveland, and I wouldn't ask him for a favor if I were sinking.\r\nBut tell me what plan you have in your mind, and I'll see if I can't aid\r\nyou--through friends.\"\r\n\r\nI replied that I hoped to have some man appointed as Chief Justice in\r\nUtah who should adopt a less rigorous way of adjudicating upon the cases\r\nof polygamists; but that before he was selected--or at least before he\r\nknew of his appointment--I wished to talk with him and convert him to\r\nthe idea that he could begin the solution of \"the Mormon question\"\r\nby having the leaders of the community come into his court and accept\r\nsentences that should not be inconsistent with the sovereignty of the\r\nlaw but not unmerciful to the subjects of that sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\"The man you want,\" Mr. Hewitt said, \"is here in New York--Elliot F.\r\nSandford. He's a referee of the Supreme Court of this state--a fine man,\r\ngreat legal ability, courageous, of undoubted integrity. Come to me,\r\ntomorrow. I'll introduce you to him.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that I had even heard the name of Elliot F.\r\nSandford; and I had not the faintest notion of how best to approach him.\r\n\r\nI did not find him in Mr. Hewitt's office, on the morrow; but the Mayor\r\nhad communicated with him, and now gave me a letter of introduction to\r\nhim; and I went alone to present it.\r\n\r\nHe received me in his outer office, with a manner full of kindliness but\r\nnon-committal. He glanced through my letter of introduction, and I tried\r\nto read him while he did it. He was not on the surface. He was a tall,\r\ndignified man, his hair turning gray--thoughtful, judicial--evidently\r\na man who was not quick to decide. He led me into his private room, and\r\nsat down with the air of a lawyer who has been asked to take a case and\r\nwho wishes first to hear all the details of the action.\r\n\r\nI began by describing the Mormon situation as I saw it in those days:\r\nthat the Mormons were growing more desperately determined in their\r\nopposition, because they believed their prosecutors were persecuting\r\nthem; that the District Attorney and his assistants were harsh to the\r\npoint of heartlessness, and that Judge Zane (to us, then) acted like\r\na religious fanatic in his judicial office; that nearly every Federal\r\nofficial in Utah had taken a tone of bigoted opposition to the people;\r\nand that the law was detested and the government despised because of the\r\nactions of Federal \"carpet-baggers.\"\r\n\r\nI was prejudiced, no doubt, and partisan in my account of the state of\r\naffairs, but I did not exaggerate the facts as I saw them; I believed\r\nwhat I said.\r\n\r\nI did not really reach his sympathy until I spoke of the court system\r\nin Utah--the open venire, the employment of \"professional jurors\"--the\r\nlegal doctrine of \"segregation,\" under which a man might be separately\r\nindicted for every day of his living in plural marriage--and the result\r\nof all this: that the pursuit of defendants and the confiscation of\r\nproperty had become less an enforcement of law than a profitable legal\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours of argument and examination, I ended with an appeal to\r\nhim to accept the opportunity to undertake a merciful assuagement of\r\nour misery. After so many years of failure on the part of the Federal\r\nauthorities, he might have the distinction of calling into his court the\r\nMormon leaders who had been most long and vainly sought by the law;\r\nand by sentencing them to a supportable punishment, he could begin the\r\ncomposition of a conflict that had gone on for half a century.\r\n\r\nHe replied with reasons that expressed a kindly unwillingness to\r\nundertake the work. It would mean the sacrifice of his professional\r\ncareer in New York. He would be putting himself entirely outside the\r\nprogression of advancement. His friends, here, would never understand\r\nwhy he had done it. The affairs of Utah had little interest for them.\r\n\r\nI saw that he was not convinced. His wife had been waiting some minutes\r\nin the outer office; he proposed that he should bring her in; and I\r\ngathered from his manner, that he expected her to pronounce against his\r\naccepting my solicitation, and so terminate our interview pleasantly,\r\nwith the aid of the feminine social grace.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sandford, when she entered, certainly looked the very lady to\r\ndo the thing with gentle skill. She was handsome, with an animated\r\nexpression, dark-eyed, dark-haired, charming in her costume, a woman\r\nof the smiling world, but maturely sincere and unaffected. I took a\r\nsomewhat distracted impression of her greeting, and heard him begin to\r\nexplain my proposal to her, as one hears a \"silent partner\" formally\r\nconsulted by a man who has already made up his mind. But when I glanced\r\nat her, seated, her manner had changed. She was listening as if she were\r\nused to being consulted and knew the responsibilities of decision. She\r\nhad the abstracted eye of impersonal consideration--silent--with now and\r\nthen a slow, meditative glance at me.\r\n\r\nHer first question seemed merely femininely curious as to the domestic\r\naspects of polygamy. How did the women endure it?\r\n\r\nI repeated a conversation I had once had with Frances Willard, who had\r\nsaid: \"The woman's heart must ache in polygamy.\" To which I had made the\r\nobvious reply: \"Don't women's hearts ache all over the world? Is there\r\nany condition of society in which women do not bear more than an equal\r\nshare of the suffering?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Sandford asked me pointedly whether I was living in polygamy?\r\n\r\nNo, I was not.\r\n\r\nDid I believe in it?\r\n\r\nI believed that those did who practiced it.\r\n\r\nWhy didn't I practice it?\r\n\r\nThose who practiced it believed that it had been authorized by a divine\r\nrevelation. I had not received such a revelation. I did not expect to.\r\n\r\nOur talk warmed into a very intimate discussion of the lives of the\r\nMormon people, but I supposed that she was moved only by a curiosity\r\nto which I was accustomed--a curiosity that was not necessarily\r\nsympathetic--the curiosity one might have about the domestic life of\r\na Mohammedan. I took advantage of her curiosity to lead up to an\r\nexplanation of how the proscription of polygamy was driving young\r\nMormons into the practice, instead of frightening them from it. And so\r\nI arrived at another recountal of the miserable condition of persecution\r\nand suffering which I had come to ask her husband help us relieve; and\r\nI made my appeal again, to them both, with something of despair, because\r\nof my failure with him, and perhaps with greater effect because of my\r\ndespair. She listened thoughtfully, her hands clasped.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem that I had reached her--until she turned to him, and\r\nsaid unexpectedly \"It seems to me that this is an opportunity--a larger\r\nopportunity than any I see here--to do a great deal of good.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not appear as surprised as I was. He made some joking reference\r\nto his income and asked her if she would be willing to live on a salary\r\nof--How much was the salary of the Chief Justice of Utah?\r\n\r\nI thought it was about $3,000 a year.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred and fifty dollars a month,\" he said. \"How many bonnets will\r\nthat buy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she retorted, \"you can't put the blame on my millinery bill. If\r\nthat's been the cause of your hesitation, I'll agree to dress as becomes\r\nthe wife of a poor but upright judge.\"\r\n\r\nIn such a happy spirit of good-natured raillery, my petition was\r\nprovisionally entertained, till I could see the President; and it is\r\none of the curiosities of experience, as I look back upon it now, that\r\na decision so momentous in the history of Utah owed its induction to the\r\nwisdom of a woman and was confirmed with a domestic pleasantry.\r\n\r\nI left them after we had arrived at the tacit understanding that if\r\nPresident Cleveland should make the appointment, Mr. Sandford would\r\naccept it with the end in view that I had proposed. I went to report\r\nmy progress, in a cipher telegram, to Salt Lake City, and I recall the\r\npeculiarly mixed satisfaction with which I regarded my work, as I\r\nwalked the streets of New York after this interview. In all that city\r\nof millions, I knew, there were few if any men who were the equal of my\r\nfather in the essentials of manhood; and yet, before he could enjoy the\r\nliberties of which they were so lightly unconscious, he must endure the\r\nshame of a prison. I was rejoicing because I was succeeding in getting\r\nfor him a sentence that should not be ruinous! I was pleased because a\r\nprospective judge had been persuaded to be not too harsh to him!\r\n\r\nIt did not make me bitter. I realized that the peculiar faith which we\r\nhad accepted was responsible for our peculiar suffering. I saw that we\r\nwere working out our human destiny; and if that destiny was not of God,\r\nbut merely the issue of human impulsion, still our only prospect of\r\nsuccess would come of our bearing with experience patiently to make us\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nWhen I went back to Mr. Hewitt, to tell him of my success, I consulted\r\nwith him upon the best way of approaching Mr. Cleveland. And he was not\r\nencouraging. In his opinion of the President, he had, as I could see,\r\nthe impatient resentment which a quick-minded, nervous, small-bodied\r\nman has for the big, slow one whose mental operations are stubbornly\r\ndeliberate and leisurely. And he was obviously irritated by the\r\nPresident's continual assumption that he was better than his party.\r\n\"He's honest,\" he said, \"by right of original discovery of what honesty\r\nis. No one can question his honesty. But as soon as he discovers a\r\nbetter thing than he knew previously, he announces it as if it were\r\nthe discovery of a new planet. It may have been a commonplace for a\r\ngeneration. That doesn't signify. He announces it with such ponderosity\r\nthat the world believes it's as prodigious as his sentences!\"\r\n\r\nAs for my own mission: I would have to be persistent, patient,\r\nand--lucky. \"You'll have to be lucky, if you intend to persuade him to\r\nacquire any information. He's been so successful in instructing mankind\r\nthat it's hard to get him to see he doesn't know all he ought to know\r\nabout a public question. But he's honest and he's courageous. If you can\r\nconvince him that your view is right, he'll carry but the conviction\r\nin spite of everything. In fact he'll be all the better pleased if it\r\nrequires fearlessness and defiance of general sentimentality to carry it\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave me a letter to Mr. William C. Whitney, then Secretary of the\r\nNavy, explaining my purpose in coming to Washington, and asking him to\r\nobtain for me an interview with President Cleveland without using Mr.\r\nHewitt's name. Then he shook hands with me, and wished me success. \"I\r\nhave the faith,\" he said, \"that is without hope.\"\r\n\r\nThat expressed my own feeling. The faith that was without hope!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. Without A Country\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I came to Washington. So I entered the capital of the government that\r\ncommanded my allegiance and inspired my fear. I wonder whether another\r\nAmerican ever saw that city with such eyes of envy, of aspiration, of\r\nwistful pride, of daunted admiration. Here were all the consecrations\r\nof a nation's memories, and they thrilled me, even while they pierced me\r\nwith the sense that I was not, and might well despair of ever being,\r\na citizen of their glory. Here were the monuments of patriotism\r\nin Statuary Hall, erected to the men whose histories had been the\r\ninspiration of my boyhood; and I remember how I stood before them,\r\nconscious that I was now almost an outlaw from their communion of\r\nsplendor. I remember how I saw, with an indescribable conflict\r\nof feelings, the ranked graves of the soldiers in the cemetery at\r\nArlington, and recollected that this very ground had been taken from\r\nGeneral Lee, that heroic opponent of Federal authority--and read the\r\ntablet, \"How sleep the brave who sink to rest by all their country's\r\nwishes bless'd,\"--and bowed in spirit to the nation's benediction upon\r\nthe men who had upheld its power. I was awed by a prodigious sense\r\nof the majesty of that power. I saw with fear its immovability to the\r\nstruggles of our handful of people. And at night, walking under the\r\ntrees of Lafayette Park, with all the odors of the southern Spring\r\namong the leaves, I looked at the lighted front of the White House and\r\nrealized that behind the curtains of those quiet windows sat the\r\nruler who held the almost absolute right of life and death over our\r\ncommunity--as if it were the palace of a Czar that I must soon enter,\r\nwith a petition for clemency, which he might refuse to entertain!\r\n\r\nWhen I had been in Washington, four years before, as secretary to\r\nDelegate John T. Caine of Utah, I had felt a younger assurance that\r\nour resistance would slowly wear out the Federal authority and carry us\r\nthrough to statehood. Four years of disaster had starved out that hope.\r\nThe proposition had been established that Congress had supreme control\r\nover the territories; and there was no virtue either in our religious\r\nassumption of warrant to speak for God, or in our plea of inherent\r\nconstitutional right to manage our own affairs. Thirty years earlier, my\r\nfather had been elected Senator from the proposed state of Utah, and he\r\nhad been rejected. In thirty years so little progress had been made! The\r\nway that was yet to travel seemed very long and very dark.\r\n\r\nOut of this mood of despondence I had to lift myself by an act of will.\r\nThere, Washington itself helped me against itself. I made a pilgrimage\r\nof courage to its commemorations of courage, and drew an inspiration\r\nof hope from its monuments to the achievements of its past. And\r\nparticularly I went to the house in which my father had lived when he\r\nhad had his part in the statesman life of the capital, and animated my\r\nresolution with the thought that I must succeed in order that he might\r\nbe restored in public honor.\r\n\r\nI narrate all this personal incident of emotion in the hope that it may\r\nhelp to explain a success that might otherwise seem inexplicable.\r\nThe Mormon Church had, for years, employed every art of intrigue and\r\ndiplomacy to protect itself in Washington. I wish to make plain that\r\nit was not by any superior cunning of negotiation that my mission\r\nsucceeded. I undertook the task almost without instruction; I performed\r\nit without falsehood; I had nothing in my mind but an honest loyalty\r\nfor my own people, a desire to be a citizen of my native country, and a\r\nfilial devotion to the one man in the world, whom I most admired.\r\n\r\nWhen I delivered my letter of introduction from Mr. Hewitt to Mr.\r\nWilliam C. Whitney, Secretary of the Navy, I found him very busy with\r\nhis work in his department--carrying out the plans that established the\r\nmodern American navy and entitled him to be called the \"father\" of it.\r\nHe withdrew from the men who were discussing designs and figures at a\r\ntable in his room, and sat with me before a window that looked out upon\r\nthe White House and its grounds; and he listened to me, interestedly,\r\ngenially, but with a thought still (as I could see) for the affairs that\r\nmy arrival had interrupted. He struck me as a man who was used to having\r\nmany weighty matters together on his mind, without finding his attention\r\ncrowded by them all, and without being impatient in his consideration of\r\nany.\r\n\r\nI developed with him an idea which I had been considering: that the\r\nPresident might not only help the Mormons by taking up their case, but\r\nmight gain political prestige for the coming campaign for re-election,\r\nby adjusting the dissentions in Utah. He heard me with a twinkle. He\r\nthought an interview might be arranged. He made an appointment to see\r\nme in the afternoon and to have with him Colonel Daniel S. Lamont, the\r\nPresident's secretary, who was then Mr. Cleveland's political \"trainer.\"\r\n\r\nMy meeting with Colonel Lamont, in the afternoon, began jocularly.\r\n\"This,\" Mr. Whitney introduced me, \"is the young man who has a plan to\r\nuse that mooted--and booted--Mormon question to re-elect the President.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly that, Mr. Secretary,\" I said. \"I have a plan to help my father\r\nand his colleagues to regain their citizenship. If President Cleveland's\r\nre-election is essential to it, I suppose I must submit. You know I'm a\r\nRepublican.\"\r\n\r\nThey laughed. We sat down. And I found at once that Colonel Lamont\r\nunderstood the situation in Utah, thoroughly. He had often discussed\r\nit, he said, with the Church's agents in Washington. I went over the\r\nsituation with him, as I had gone over it with Mr. Sandford, in careful\r\ndetail. He seemed surprised at my assurance that my father and the other\r\nproscribed leaders of the Church would submit themselves to the courts\r\nif they could do so on the conditions that I proposed; I convinced\r\nhim of the possibility by referring him to Mr. Richards, the Church's\r\nattorney in Washington, for a confirmation of it. I pointed out that if\r\nthese leaders surrendered, President Cleveland could be made the direct\r\nbeneficiary, politically, of their composition with the law.\r\n\r\nColonel Lamont was a small, alert man with a conciseness of speech\r\nand manner that is associated in my memory with the bristle of his red\r\nmustache cut short and hard across a decisive mouth. He radiated nervous\r\nvitality; and I understood, as I studied him, how President Cleveland,\r\nwith his infinite patience for [** missing text?**] survived so well in\r\nthe multitudinous duties of his office--having as his secretary a man\r\nborn with the ability to cut away the non-essentials, and to pass on to\r\nMr. Cleveland only the affairs worthy of his careful deliberation.\r\n\r\nI was doubtful whether I should tell Colonel Lamont and Mr. Whitney of\r\nmy conversation with Mr. Sandford. I decided that their considerateness\r\nentitled them to my full confidence, and I told them all--begging them,\r\nif I was indiscreet or undiplomatic, to charge the offense to my lack of\r\nexperience rather than to debit it against my cause.\r\n\r\nThey passed it off with banter. It was understood that the President\r\nshould not be told--and that I should not tell him--of my talk with\r\nMr. Sandford. Colonel Lamont undertook to arrange an audience with Mr.\r\nCleveland for me. \"You had better wait,\" he said, \"until I can approach\r\nhim with the suggestion that there's a young man here, from Utah, whom\r\nhe ought to see.\"\r\n\r\nI knew, then, that I was at least well started on the open road to\r\nsuccess. I knew that if Colonel Lamont said he would help me, there\r\nwould be no difficulties in my way except those that were large in the\r\nperson of the President himself.\r\n\r\nTwo days later I received the expected word from Colonel Lamont, and I\r\nwent to the White House as a man might go to face his own trial. I\r\nmet the secretary in one of the eastern upstairs rooms of the official\r\napartments; and after the usual crowd had passed out, he led me into the\r\nPresident's office--which then overlooked the Washington monument, the\r\nPotomac and the Virginia shore. Mr. Cleveland was working at his desk.\r\nColonel Lamont introduced me by name, and added, \"the young man from\r\nUtah, of whom I spoke.\"\r\n\r\nThe President did not look up. He was signing some papers, bending\r\nheavily over his work. It took him a moment or two to finish; then he\r\ndropped his pen, pushed aside the papers, turned awkwardly in his swivel\r\nchair and held out his hand to me. It was a cool, firm hand, and its\r\ngrasp surprised me, as much as the expression of his eyes--the steady\r\neyes of complete self-control, composure, intentness.\r\n\r\nI had come with a prejudice against him; I was a partisan of Mr. Blame,\r\nwhom he had defeated for the Presidency; I believed Mr. Blame to be the\r\nabler man. But there was something in Mr. Cleveland's hand and eyes\r\nto warn me that however slow-moving and even dull he might appear, the\r\nenergy of a firm will compelled and controlled him. It stiffened me into\r\ninstant attention.\r\n\r\nHe made some remark to Colonel Lamont to indicate that our conversation\r\nwas to occupy about half an hour. He asked me to be seated in a chair at\r\nthe right-hand side of his desk. He said almost challengingly: \"You're\r\nthe young man they want I should talk to about the Utah question.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone was not exactly unkind, but it was not inviting. I said, \"Yes,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me, as a judge might eye the suspect of circumstantial\r\nevidence. \"You're the son of one of the Mormon leaders.\"\r\n\r\nI admitted it.\r\n\r\nAnd then he began.\r\n\r\nHe began with an account of what he had done to compose the differences\r\nin Utah. He explained and justified the appointments he had made\r\nthere--appointments that had been recommended by Southern senators and\r\nrepresentatives who, because they were Southerners, were opposed to the\r\nundue extension and arbitrary use of Federal power. He had made Caleb\r\nW. West of Kentucky governor of Utah on the recommendation of Senator\r\nBlackburn of Kentucky, my father's friend. He had made Frank H. Dyer,\r\noriginally of Mississippi, United States Marshal. He had appointed a\r\nDistrict Attorney in whom he had every confidence. He had a right to\r\nbelieve that these men, recommended by the statesmen of the South, would\r\nexecute and adjudicate the laws in Utah according to the most lenient\r\nSouthern construction of Federal rights. He dwelt upon Governor West's\r\ncharitable intentions towards the Mormon leaders, went over West's\r\nefforts at pacification in accurate detail, and told of West's chagrin\r\nat his failure--with an irritation that showed how disappointed he\r\nhimself was with the continued recurrence of the Mormon troubles.\r\n\r\nI had to tell him that the situation had not improved, and his face\r\nflushed with an anger that he made no attempt to conceal. He declared\r\nthat the fault must lie in our obstinate determination to hold ourselves\r\nsuperior to the law. He could not sympathize with our sufferings, he\r\nsaid, since they were self-inflicted. He admitted that he had once been\r\nopposed to the Edmunds-Tucker bill, but felt now that it was justified\r\nby the immovability of the Mormons. All palliatives had failed. The\r\npatience of Congress had been exhausted. There was no recourse, except\r\nto make statutes cutting enough to destroy the illegal practices and\r\nunlawful leadership in the Mormon community.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President,\" I pleaded, \"I've lived in Utah all my life. I know\r\nthese people from both points of view. You know of the situation only\r\nfrom Federal office holders who consider it solely with regard to their\r\nofficial responsibility to you and to the country. Why not learn what\r\nthe Mormons think?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied that it was not within the province of the President--his\r\npower or his duty--to consider the mental attitude of men who were\r\nopposing the enforcement of the law.\r\n\r\nIt was an inexcusable offense against the general welfare that one\r\ncommunity should be rising continually against the Federal authority\r\nand occupying the time and attention of Congress with a determined\r\nrecalcitrance.\r\n\r\nFor an hour, he continued, with vigor and dignity, to describe the\r\nsituation as he saw it; and he chilled me to the heart with his\r\ndetermination to concede nothing more to a community that had refused to\r\nbe placated by what he had already conceded. I listened without trying,\r\nwithout even wishing, to interrupt him; for I had been warned by Mr.\r\nWhitney and Colonel Lamont that it would be wise to let him deliver\r\nhimself of his opinion before attempting to influence him to a milder\r\none; and I could not contradict anything that he said, for he made no\r\nmisstatements of fact.\r\n\r\nColonel Lamont had entered once, and had withdrawn again when he saw\r\nthat Mr. Cleveland was still talking. At the end of about an hour, the\r\nPresident rose. \"Mr. Cannon,\" he said, \"I don't see what more I can do\r\nthan has already been done. Tell your people to obey the law, as all\r\nother citizens are required to obey it, and they'll find that their\r\nfellow-citizens of this country will do full justice to their heroism\r\nand their other good qualities. If the law seems harsh, tell them that\r\nthere's an easy way to avoid its cruelty by simply getting out from\r\nunder its condemnation.\"\r\n\r\nHis manner indicated that the conference was at an end. He reached out\r\nhis hand as if to drop the subject then and forever, as far as I was\r\nconcerned. \"Mr. President,\" I asked, with the composure of desperation,\r\n\"do you really want to settle the Mormon question?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with the first gleam of humor that had shown in his\r\neyes--and it was a humor of peculiar richness and unction. \"Young man,\"\r\nhe asked, \"what have I been saying to you all this time? What have I\r\nbeen working for, ever since I first took up the consideration of this\r\nsubject at the beginning of my term?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President,\" I replied, \"if you were traveling in the West, and came\r\nto an unbridged stream with your wagon train, and saw tracks leading\r\ndown into the water where you thought there was a ford, you would\r\nnaturally expect to cross there, assuming that others had done so before\r\nyou. But suppose that some man on the bank should say to you: 'I've\r\nwatched wagon trains go in here for more than twenty years, and I've\r\nnever yet seen one come out on the other side. Look over at that\r\nopposite bank. You see there are no wagon tracks there. Now, down the\r\nriver a piece, is a place where I think there's a ford. I've never got\r\nanybody to try it yet, but certainly it's as good a chance as this one!'\r\nMr. President, what would you do? Would you attempt a crossing where\r\nthere had been twenty years of failure, or would you try the other\r\nplace--on the chance that it might take you over?\"\r\n\r\nHe had been regarding me with slowly fading amusement that gave way to\r\nan expression of grave attention.\r\n\r\n\"I've been watching this situation for several years,\" I went on, \"and\r\nit seems to me that there's the possibility of a just, a humane, and\r\na final settlement of it, by getting the Mormon leaders to come\r\nvoluntarily into court--and it can be done!--with the assurance that the\r\nobject of the administration is to correct the community evil--not to\r\nexterminate the Mormon Church or to persecute its 'prophets,' but to\r\nsecure obedience to the law and respect for the law, and to lead Utah\r\ninto a worthy statehood.\"\r\n\r\nI paused. He thought a moment. Then he said: \"I can't talk any longer,\r\nnow. Make another appointment with Lamont. I want to hear what you have\r\nto say.\" And he dismissed me.\r\n\r\nColonel Lamont told me to come back on the following afternoon; and I\r\nwent away with the dubious relief of feeling that if I had not yet won\r\nmy case I had, at least, succeeded in having judgment reserved. I went\r\nto work to arrange my arguments for the morrow, to make them as concise\r\nas possible and to divide them into brief chapters in case I should have\r\nas little opportunity for extended explanations as the President had\r\nbeen giving me. I saw that the whole matter was gloomy and oppressive\r\nto him--that his responsibility was as dark on his mind as our\r\nsufferings--and I took the hint of his amused interest, in order to work\r\nout ways of brightening the subject with anecdote and illustration.\r\n\r\nI saw Colonel Lamont on the morrow, and he beamed a congratulation on\r\nme. \"You've aroused his curiosity,\" he said. \"You've interested him.\"\r\n\r\nHe had made an appointment some days ahead; and when I entered the\r\nPresident's office to keep that appointment, I found Mr. Cleveland at\r\nhis desk, as if he had not moved in the interval, laboriously reading\r\nand signing papers as before. It gave me an impression of immovability,\r\nof patient and methodical relentlessness that was disheartening.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as he turned to me, I found him another man. He was\r\ninterested, receptive, almost genial. He gave me an opportunity to cover\r\nthe whole ground of my case, and I went over it step by step. He showed\r\nno emotion when I recited some of the incidents of pathetic suffering\r\namong our people; and at first he seemed doubtful whether he should\r\nbe amused by the humorous episodes that I narrated. But I did not wish\r\nmerely to amuse him; I was trying to convey to his mind (without saying\r\nso) that so long as a people could suffer and laugh too, they could\r\nnever be overcome by the mere reduplication of their sufferings. He\r\nlooked squarely at me, with a most determined front, when I told him\r\nthat the Mormons would be ground to powder before they would yield.\r\n\"They can't yield,\" I warned him. \"They're like the passengers on a\r\ntrain going with a mad speed down a dangerous grade. For any of them to\r\nattempt to jump is simple destruction. They can only pray to Providence\r\nto help them. But if that train were to be brought to a stop at some\r\nstation where they could alight with anything like self-respect, there\r\nwould be many of them glad to get off--even though the train had not\r\narrived at its 'revealed' destination.\"\r\n\r\nI do not remember--and if I did, it would be tedious to relate--the\r\nexact sequence and progression of argument in this interview and the\r\ndozen others that succeeded it. Mr. Cleveland became more and more\r\ninterested in the Mormon people, their family life, their religion, and\r\ntheir politics. He was as painstaking in acquiring information about\r\nthem as he was in performing all the other duties of his office. I might\r\nhave been discouraged by the number and apparent ineffectiveness of\r\nmy interviews with him, had not Colonel Lamont kept me informed of the\r\ngrowth of the President's good feeling and of his genuinely paternal\r\ninterest in the people of Utah. It became more than a personal desire\r\nwith Mr. Cleveland to benefit politically by a settlement of the Mormon\r\ntroubles, if indeed he had ever had such a desire. His humanity was\r\nenlisted, his conscience appealed to.\r\n\r\nHe asked me, once, if I knew anything of Mr. Sandford, and I replied\r\nthat I knew him and believed in him. He told me, at last, that he\r\nwas going to appoint Mr. Sandford Chief Justice of Utah, and added\r\nsignificantly, \"I suppose he will get in touch with the situation.\" I\r\naccepted this remark as a permission to confer with Mr. Sandford, and\r\nI journeyed to New York to see him and to renew the understanding I had\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nHe was appointed Chief justice on the 9th day of July, 1888, and--as the\r\nMormon people expressed it--\"the backbone of the raid was broken.\"\r\nOn August 26, 1888, he arrived in Salt Lake City. On September 17, my\r\nfather came before him in court and pleaded guilty to two indictments\r\ncharging him with \"unlawful cohabitation.\" He was fined $450 and\r\nsentenced to the penitentiary for one hundred and seventy-five days. His\r\nexample was followed by a number of prominent Mormons, including Francis\r\nMarion Lyman, who is today the President of the Quorum of the twelve\r\nApostles and next in rank for the Presidency. It is true that not many\r\ncases, relatively speaking, came to Justice Sandford; but the leader\r\nwhom the authorities were most eager to subjugate under Federal power\r\nwas judged and sentenced; and the effect, both on the country and on the\r\nMormon people, was all that we had expected.\r\n\r\nThere are memories in a man's life that have a peculiar value. One\r\nsuch, to me, is the picture I have in mind of my father undergoing\r\nhis penitentiary sentence, wearing his prison clothes with an\r\nunconsciousness that makes me still feel a pride in the power of the\r\nhuman soul to rise superior to the deformities of circumstance. Charles\r\nWilcken (whom I have described driving us to Bountiful) was visiting\r\nhim one day in the prison office, when a guard entered with his hat on.\r\nWilcken snatched it from his head. \"Never enter his presence,\" he said,\r\n\"without taking it off.\" And the guard never did again.... I salute the\r\nmemory. I come to it with my head bare and my back stiffened. I see in\r\nthat calm face the possibilities of the human spirit. He was a man!\r\n\r\nHe spent his time, there, as he would have spent it elsewhere, writing,\r\nconferring with the agents of his authority, planning for his people. I\r\nsaw he was aware that he would emerge from his imprisonment a free man,\r\npersonally, but still enslaved by the conditions of the community; and\r\nI knew that he would use his freedom to free the others. I knew that he\r\nhad accepted his sentence with this end in view. In plain words, I knew\r\nnow--though he never said so--that he was looking toward the necessary\r\nrecession from the doctrine of polygamy, and that he may have counted\r\non the spectacle of his imprisonment to help prepare his people for a\r\ngeneral submission to the law.\r\n\r\nWith the entry of these leaders into prison, the Mormons felt for them\r\na warmer admiration, a deeper reverence; but it was mingled with a\r\ngratitude to the nation for the leniency of the court and an awed sense,\r\ntoo, of the power of the civil law. President Woodruff secretly and\r\ntentatively withdrew his necessary permission, as head of the Church,\r\nto the solemnization of any more plural marriages; and he ordered the\r\ndemolition of the Endowment House in which such marriages had been\r\nchiefly celebrated. Many of the non-Mormons, who had despaired of any\r\nsolution of the troubles in Utah, now began to hope. The country had\r\nbeen impoverished; the Mormons had been deprived of much of their\r\nsubstance and financial vigor; and reasons of business prudence among\r\nthe Gentiles weighed against a continuance of proscription. Some of\r\nthem distrusted the motives of their own leaders more than they did the\r\nMormon people. Some were weary of the quarrel. For humane reasons, for\r\nbusiness reasons, for the sake of young Utah, it was argued that the\r\npersecution should end.\r\n\r\nBut in the years 1888 and 1889, thousands of newcomers arrived in Utah\r\nwith a strong antagonism to the religion and the political authority\r\nof the Mormon Church; and, with the growth of Gentile population, there\r\ncame a natural determination on their part to obtain control of the\r\nlocal governments of cities and counties. In opposing this movement,\r\nthe power of the Church was again solidified. By 1889, the Gentiles\r\nhad taken the city governments of Ogden and Salt Lake City, had elected\r\nmembers of the legislature in Salt Lake County, and had carried the\r\npassage of a Public School Bill, against the timid and secret opposition\r\nof the Church. President Cleveland had been defeated and succeeded by\r\nPresident Harrison; and Chief Justice Sandford had been removed and\r\nChief Justice Zane reinstated. (He did not adjudicate with his previous\r\nrigor, however, because of the success of Justice Sandford's policy of\r\nleniency.) The Church made no move publicly to repudiate polygamy, and\r\nits silent attitude of defiance, in this regard, gave a battle cry to\r\nall its enemies.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was precipitated by a movement that had begun in the\r\nterritory of Idaho, where the Mormons had been disfranchised by means\r\nof a test oath--(a provision still remaining in the Idaho state\r\nconstitution, but now nullified by the political power of the Mormon\r\nleaders in Salt Lake City.) A bill, known as the Cullom-Struble bill,\r\nwas introduced at Washington, to do in Utah what had been done in Idaho.\r\n\r\nThe Church was then directed by President Woodruff and his two\r\nCouncillor's, George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith. But President\r\nWoodruff was as helpless in the political world as a nun. He was a\r\ngentle, earnest old man, patiently ingenuous and simple-minded, with a\r\nfaith in the guidance of Heaven that was only greater than my father's\r\nbecause it was unmixed with any earthly sagacity. He had the mind, and\r\nthe appearance, of a country preacher, and even when he was \"on the\r\nunderground\" he used to do his daily \"stint\" of farm labor, secretly,\r\neither at night or in the very early morning. He was a successful\r\nfarmer (born in Connecticut), of a Yankee shrewdness and industry. He\r\nrecognized that in order to get a crop of wheat, it was necessary to do\r\nsomething more than trust in the Lord. But in administering the affairs\r\nof the Church, he seemed to have no such sophistication.\r\n\r\nI can see him yet, at the meetings of the Presidency, opening his mild\r\nblue eyes in surprised horror at a report of some new danger threatening\r\nus. \"My conscience! My conscience!\" he would cry. \"Is that so, brother!\"\r\nWhen he was assured that it was so, he would say, resignedly: \"The Lord\r\nwill look after us!\" And then, after a silence, turning to his First\r\nCouncillor, he would ask: \"What do you think we ought to do, Brother\r\nGeorge Q.?\"\r\n\r\nThe Second Councillor, Joseph F. Smith, sat at these meetings, in a\r\nsaturnine reserve and silence, either nursing his concealed thought or\r\nhaving none. When a decision had been suggested, he was appealed to and\r\nadded his assent. It always seemed to me that he was sulkily sleepy;\r\nbut this impression may have come from the contrast of the First\r\nCouncillor's mental alertness and the bright cheerfulness of the\r\nPresident--who never, to my knowledge, showed the slightest bitterness\r\nagainst anybody. President Woodruff believed that all the persecutions\r\nof the Mormons were due to the Devil's envy of the Lord's power as it\r\nshowed itself in the establishment of the Mormon Church: and he assumed\r\nthat the Gentiles did the work they were tempted to do against us,\r\nbecause the Holy Spirit had not yet ousted the evil from their souls.\r\nHe had no fear of the ultimate triumph of the Church, because he had no\r\nfear of the ultimate triumph of God. Whenever he could escape for a day\r\nfrom the worldly duties of his office, he went fishing!\r\n\r\nWhen the progress of the Cullom-Struble bill began to make its\r\nthreatening advance, my father went secretly to Washington; and a short\r\ntime afterwards, word came to me in Ogden, through the Presidency, that\r\nhe wished me to arrange my business affairs for a long absence from\r\nUtah, and follow him to the capital.\r\n\r\nI found him there, in the office of Delegate John T. Caine of Utah--the\r\ncluttered office of a busy man--and he explained, composedly, why he had\r\nsent for me. The Cullom-Struble bill had been favorably considered by\r\nthe Senate Committee on Territories, and the disfranchisement of all the\r\nMormons of Utah seemed imminent. Every argument, political or legal,\r\nhad been used against the measure, in vain. Since I, a non-polygamous\r\nMormon, would be disfranchised if the bill became law, he thought I\r\nmight be a good advocate against it. He said: \"I have not appeared in\r\nthe matter. None of our friends know that I am here. If it were known,\r\nit might only increase our difficulties. Say nothing of it. We have been\r\nat a disadvantage with a Republican administration because most of our\r\nprominent men are Democrats. You were so effective with the Democrats,\r\nlet us see what you can do now with your own party friends.\"\r\n\r\nAfter taking his advice, I went to see Senator Henry M. Teller, of\r\nColorado, who was a friend of my father and of the Mormon people. He\r\nadmitted that the situation was desperate. He proposed that I should\r\nspeak before the committees of both houses; they might listen to me as\r\na Republican who had no official rank in the Church and no political\r\nauthority. He offered to introduce me to any of the Senators and members\r\nof Congress, but advised that I should rather go unintroduced, without\r\ninfluence, and make my appeal as a private citizen.\r\n\r\nThis sounded to me depressingly like the call to lead a \"forlorn hope.\"\r\nI reported to my father again, and was not altogether reassured by a\r\ntranquility which he seemed to be able to maintain in the face of any\r\ndesperation. Other agencies of the Church had reached the end of their\r\nresources. There was no help in sight. And I went, at last, to throw our\r\ncase upon the mercy of the Secretary of State, Mr. James G. Blaine,\r\nmy father's friend, the friend of our people, the statesman whom I--in\r\ncommon with millions of other Americans--regarded with a reverence that\r\napproached idolatry.\r\n\r\nHe received me in the long room of the Secretary's apartments, standing,\r\na striking figure in black, against the rich and heavy background of the\r\nofficial furnishing. He was very pale--unhealthily so--perhaps with the\r\nprogress of the disease of which he was to die in so short a time. In\r\ncontrast with his usual brilliancy of mind, he seemed to me, at first,\r\ndepressed and quiet--with a kindly serenity of manner, at once gracious,\r\nand intimate, but masterful.\r\n\r\nHe was instantly and deeply interested in what I had to say; he seated\r\nhimself--on a sofa, near the embrasure of a window--motioned me to bring\r\na chair to his side, and heard me in an erect attitude of thoughtful\r\nattention, re-assuring me now and then by reaching out to lay a hand\r\non my knee when he saw from my hesitancy that I feared I might be too\r\ncandid in my confidences; and the look of his eye and the touch of\r\nhis hand were as if he said: \"I'm your friend. Anything you may say is\r\nperfectly safe with me.\"\r\n\r\nI told him of my father's imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\"It is dreadful,\" he said. \"You shock me to the soul.\" He spoke of their\r\nfriendship, of his admiration for my father's work in Congress, of his\r\npersonal regard for the man himself. \"Of course,\" he said, \"I have no\r\nsympathy with your peculiar marriage system, and I'll never be able to\r\nunderstand how a man like your father could enter it.\" I reminded him\r\nthat my father believed it a system revealed and ordained by God. \"I\r\nknow,\" he replied. \"That is what they say. And I suppose they have\r\nscriptural warrant for polygamy. But it is a thing that would be 'more\r\nhonored in the breach than the observance.' Tell me, is the rule of the\r\nChurch absolute over you younger men?\"\r\n\r\nI told him that it was, in respect of political control; that the\r\nsituation in Utah had placed us where there was no possibility of\r\ncompromise; that we must be of, with, and for our own people, or against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe asked me whether I intended to address myself to the President. I\r\nreplied, \"Not yet\"--since the bills were still pending in Congress\r\nand were not being urged from the White House. He seemed pleased. As I\r\nafterwards learned, there was a strong rivalry between the President and\r\nthe Secretary of State; and though I knew that Mr. Blaine's interest\r\nin Utah was almost wholly one of responsible statesmanship, warmed by\r\na personal kindliness for our people, still it remains a fact that he\r\nexpected the support of the Utah Republican delegation in the convention\r\nof 1892, and that it had been promised him by national Republicans who\r\nwere now laboring at Washington in our behalf.\r\n\r\nHe encouraged me with an almost intimate emotion of pity and\r\nfriendliness; and I felt the largeness of the man as much in the warmth\r\nof his humanity as in the breadth of his view. He approved, of my\r\nappearing before the committees. \"Go and tell them your own story,\r\nyourself,\" he said. \"Make your plea independently of all the formal and\r\nofficial arguments that have been used. These have been exhausted.\r\nThey have been ineffective. We must use the personal and\"--he added it\r\nsignificantly--\"the political appeal. If you find difficulty, let me\r\nknow. I shall not be idle in your behalf. If you meet any insuperable\r\nobstacle, I'll see if I can't help you run over it.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose to terminate the interview. He looked at me with a smile. \"'The\r\nLord giveth,'\" he said, \"'and the Lord taketh away.' Wouldn't it be\r\npossible for your people to find some way--without disobedience to\r\nthe commands of God--to bring yourselves into harmony with the law and\r\ninstitutions of this country? Believe me, it's not possible for any\r\npeople as weak in numbers as yours, to set themselves up as superior\r\nto the majesty of a nation like this. We may succeed, this time, in\r\npreventing your disfranchisement; but nothing permanent can be done\r\nuntil you 'get into line.'\"\r\n\r\nHe accompanied me toward the door, giving me friendly messages of regard\r\nto deliver to my father. He put his arm around my shoulders, at last,\r\nand said: \"You may tell your father for me--as I tell you, young\r\nman--you shall not be harmed, this time.\"\r\n\r\nI parted from him with an almost speechless relief and gratitude, and\r\nhurried to my father with the news of hope. I had not told Mr. Blaine\r\nthat he was in Washington; for, without feeling that he saw himself\r\nmarked by his imprisonment, I was aware that his friends might pity him\r\nfor it, if they did not condemn him; and neither sentiment (I knew) was\r\nhe of the personal temper to encounter.\r\n\r\nI told him every detail of my talk with the Secretary of State; he heard\r\nme, silently, meditatively. When I concluded with Mr. Blaine's assurance\r\nthat we should not be harmed \"this time,\" but must \"get into line,\"\r\nhe looked up at me with a significant steadiness of eye. \"President\r\nWoodruff,\" he said, \"has been praying.... He thinks he sees some\r\nlight.... You are authorized to say that something will be done.\"\r\n\r\nI asked no question. His gaze conveyed assurance, but forbade inquiry. I\r\nhad to understand, without being told, that the Church was preparing to\r\nconcede a recession from the doctrine of polygamy.\r\n\r\nWith this assurance to aid me, I began the work of reaching the\r\ncommittees--warm work in a Washington summer, but hopeful in the new\r\nprospect of a lasting success. The bill for disfranchisement had been\r\nreported out by the committees and was on the calendar for passage. It\r\nwas necessary to have the question reopened before the committees\r\nfor argument. In soliciting the opportunity of a re-hearing, from\r\nthe Chairman of the Senate Committee, Senator Orville H. Platt, of\r\nConnecticut, I made my argument in a private conversation with him in\r\nhis rooms in the Arlington Hotel. When I had done, he chewed his cigar\r\na moment, looked at me quizzically, and asked: \"Do you know Abbot R.\r\nHeywood, of Ogden?\"--and, as he asked it, he drew a letter from his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nI replied that I knew Mr. Heywood well.\r\n\r\n\"I have a letter here from him, on this same subject,\" he said. \"Tell\r\nme. What kind of man is he? And to what extent do you think I ought to\r\ndepend on his views?\"\r\n\r\nI was never more tempted in my life to tell a lie. I knew Mr. Heywood\r\nto be a man of truth and high ideals; but he had been Chairman of the\r\nAnti-Church party in Weber County, and he had been one of the Gentile\r\nleaders for several years. I knew the intensity of his feelings against\r\nthe rule of the Church in politics and the Mormon attitude of defiance\r\nto the law. I was sure that he would be strong in his demand for the\r\npassage of the disfranchisement act.\r\n\r\nI hesitated a moment. Senator Platt was watching me. Then, with a\r\nresolve that our cause must stand or fall by the truth, I said: \"Mr.\r\nHeywood is a man of integrity. I think he would write exactly what he\r\nbelieved to be true. But you know, Senator, intense feeling in politics\r\nsometimes sways a man's judgment. In view of Mr. Heywood's long\r\ncontroversy, I hope that if he has taken a view adverse to mine, his\r\nantagonism may be mitigated in your mind by your own knowledge of human\r\nfeelings.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Platt held out the letter to me. \"You've won your motion for a\r\nre-hearing,\" he said. \"I think we may be able to get the truth out of\r\nyou. We have not always had it in this Utah question. Read that.\"\r\n\r\nI read it. It was Mr. Heywood's solemn protest, as an American\r\ncitizen--on behalf of himself and the other members of the\r\nperfunctory Republican Committee of his County--against the wholesale\r\ndisfranchisement of the Mormons, on the ground that it would only delay\r\na progressive American settlement of the territory!\r\n\r\nThen I went to the other members of the Senate committee privately,\r\nand told them that the Mormon Church was about to make a concession\r\nconcerning its doctrine of polygamy. I told them so in confidence,\r\npointing out the necessity of secrecy, since to make public the news\r\nof such a recession, in advance, would be to prevent the Church from\r\nauthorizing it. Not one of the Senators betrayed the trust. I was less\r\nconfidential with the members of the House Committee, because I realized\r\nthat nothing could be done against us unless the bill passed the Senate.\r\nBut I gave the news of the Church's reconsideration of its attitude\r\nto Colonel G. W. R. Dorsey, the member from Nebraska, and he used his\r\ninfluence to get me a rehearing from the House Committee. Finally I\r\nappeared once before each committee, and argued our case at length. The\r\nbills did not become law. Aided by Mr. Blaine's powerful friendship, we\r\nwere saved \"for the time.\"\r\n\r\nIt remained to make our safety permanent, and I took train for Utah, on\r\nmy father's counsel, to see President Woodruff. I had given my word that\r\n\"something was to be done.\" I went to plead that it should be done--and\r\ndone speedily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. The Manifesto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI found him in the office of the Presidency--in the little one-story\r\nhouse that I have described in my early interview with Joseph F\r\nSmith--and he received me with the gracious affectionateness of a\r\nfatherly old man. He asked me, almost at once: \"What are they going to\r\ndo to us in Washington?\"\r\n\r\n\"President Woodruff,\" I replied, \"we've been spared--temporarily. The\r\naxe will not fall for a few moments. It depends on ourselves, now,\r\nwhether it shall fall or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come into the other room,\" he said, under his voice, in an eager\r\nconfidentiality, like a child with a secret. And pattering along ahead\r\nof me, quick on his feet, he signed to me to follow him--with little\r\nnods and beckonings--into the retiring room where I had talked with\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nThere he sat down, on the edge of his chair, his elbows supported on the\r\nbroad arms, leaning forward, partly bowed with his age, and partly with\r\nan intentness of curiosity that glittered innocently in his guileless\r\neyes. A dear old character! Sweet in his sentiments, sweet in his\r\nlanguage, sweet in the expression of his face.\r\n\r\nI told him, in detail, of the events in Washington, and of the men who\r\nhad helped us in them--particularly of Mr. Blaine, who was apparently\r\na new character in his experience, and of Senator Orville H. Platt, in\r\nwhom he discovered an almost neighborly interest when I told him that\r\nthe Senator came from Connecticut, his native state. I warned him that\r\nthe passage of the measure of disfranchisement had been no more than\r\nretarded. I pointed out the fatal consequences for the community if the\r\nbill should ever become law--the fatal consequences for the leaders of\r\nthe Church if the non-polygamous Mormons, deprived of their votes, were\r\never left unable to control the administration of local government. I\r\nrepeated the promise that my father had authorized me to carry to the\r\nSenators and Congressmen who still had the Cullom-Struble bill in hand;\r\nand I emphasized the fact that because of this promise the bill had been\r\nheld back--with the certainty that it would never become law if we met\r\nthe nation half way.\r\n\r\nI was watching him to see if he sensed the point I wished him to get.\r\nWhen I touched the matter of my father's promise, his face became softly\r\nreverent; and when I had done--looking at me without a trace of cunning\r\nin his benignity, with an expression, rather, of exalted innocence\r\nand faith,--he said: \"Brother Frank, I have been making it a matter of\r\nprayer. I have wrestled mightily with the Lord. And I think I see some\r\nlight.\"\r\n\r\nIn order that there might be no misunderstanding, I put into plainer\r\nwords what I meant and what the prominent men in Washington had been led\r\nto look for: since, by a \"revelation\" of the Church we were ordered\r\nto give obedience to the government of the nation, and since we had\r\nexhausted all our legal defenses, it was hoped that the Prophet, Seer,\r\nand Revelator of the Church would find a way, under the guidance of God,\r\nto bring our people into conformity with the law.\r\n\r\nAs he accepted this calmly, I added: \"To be very plain with you,\r\nPresident Woodruff, our friends expect, and the country will insist,\r\nthat the Church shall yield the practice of plural marriage.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyelids quivered a little, but he showed no other sign of flinching.\r\nI saw that the counsels of his advisers and the comfort that he had\r\nderived from his prayers had prepared him for an immolation that was\r\nmore serious to him than any personal sacrifice that he could make. He\r\nsaid sadly: \"I had hoped we wouldn't have to meet this trouble this way.\r\nYou know what it means to our people. I had hoped that the Lord might\r\nopen the minds of the people of this nation to the truth, so that\r\nthey might be converted to the everlasting covenant. Our prophets have\r\nsuffered like those of old, and I thought that the persecutions of Zion\r\nwere enough--that they would bring some other reward than this.\" If I\r\nhad been the bearer of a new edict of proscription, I think he could not\r\nhave been more profoundly oppressed by the sense of his responsibility.\r\n\"Did your father tell you,\" he asked, \"that I had been seeking the mind\r\nof the Lord?\"\r\n\r\nI replied that he had.\r\n\r\nHe reflected silently. \"I shall talk with you again about it,\" he said,\r\nat last. \"I hope the Lord will make the way plain for his people.\"\r\n\r\nI do not wish to idealize the polygamous relation--but in monogamy a man\r\nis not persecuted for his marriage, and sometimes he does not appreciate\r\nthe tie. In polygamy, the men and women alike had been compelled to\r\nsuffer on its account by the grim trials of the life itself and by the\r\nhatred of all civilization arrayed against it. They had grown to value\r\ntheir marriage system by what it had cost them. They had been driven by\r\nthe contempt of the world to argue for its sanctity, to live up to their\r\ndeclarations, and to raise it in their esteem to what it professed to\r\nbe, the celestial order that prevailed in the Heavens! I knew, as well\r\nas President Woodruff did, the wrench it would give their hearts to have\r\nto abandon, at last, what they had so long suffered for.\r\n\r\nIn the days of anxious waiting that followed, I saw Joseph F. Smith and\r\nsounded him for any hint of progress. He said: \"I'm sure I don't know\r\nwhat can be done. Your father talked with President Woodruff and me\r\nbefore he went to Washington, but I'm sure I can't see how we can\r\ndo anything.\" When my father returned home, I went to him many\r\ntimes--without however learning anything definite. I knew that the men\r\nin Washington would demand some tangible evidence of our good faith\r\nbefore Congress should reconvene; and I repeatedly urged the necessity\r\nof action.\r\n\r\nAt length he sent me word, in Ogden, that President Woodruff wished to\r\nconfer with me, and he suggested that it would be permissible for me to\r\nspeak my opinions freely. I hastened to Salt Lake City, to the offices\r\nof the Presidency. President Woodruff took me into a private room and\r\nread me his \"manifesto.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the same that was issued on September 24, 1890, and ratified by a\r\nGeneral Conference of the Mormon Church on October 6, following. It\r\nwas the proclamation that freed the oppressed of Utah; for, by the\r\nsubsequent \"covenant\"--and its acceptance by the Federal government--the\r\nnation did but confirm their freedom and accord them their\r\nconstitutional rights. Here, shaking in the hand of age, was a sheet of\r\npaper by which the future of a half million people was to be directed;\r\nand that simple old man was to speak through it, to them, with the awful\r\nauthority of the voice of God.\r\n\r\nHe told me he had written it himself, and it certainly appeared to me\r\nto be in his handwriting. Its authorship has since been variously\r\nattributed. Some of the present-day polygamists say that it was I who\r\nwrote it. Chas. W. Penrose and George Reynolds have claimed that they\r\nedited it. I presume that as Mormons, \"in good standing,\" believing in\r\nthe inspiration of the Prophet, they appreciate the blasphemy of their\r\nclaim!\r\n\r\nI found it disappointingly mild. It denied that the Church had been\r\nsolemnizing any plural marriages of late, and advised the faithful\r\n\"to refrain from contracting any marriages forbidden by the law of the\r\nland.\" In spite of this mildness, President Woodruff asked me whether\r\nI thought the Mormons would support the revelation--whether they would\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\nI replied that there could be no proper anxiety on that point. The\r\nmajority of the Mormon people were ready for such a message. It might\r\nbe very much stronger without arousing resistance. With the exception\r\nof the comparatively few men and women who were living in polygamy, the\r\ncommunity would accept it gratefully. Rather, I made bold to say,\r\nmy anxiety was as to whether the nation would believe that such an\r\nequivocally-worded document meant an absolute recession from the\r\npractice of plural marriage.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that his advisers had not pointed out this danger to him.\r\nHe asked me how I thought the nation would take it.\r\n\r\nI asked him, point blank, whether it meant an absolute recession from\r\npolygamy.\r\n\r\nHe answered that it did.\r\n\r\nThen (I said) with such an interpretation of it, and a formal and public\r\nacceptance of it by the Church authorities, I did not doubt that we\r\ncould convince the nation of its sufficiency. I reminded him--as I am\r\nnow glad to remember--that the word of the Mormon people had passed\r\ncurrent in the political and commercial circles of the country; that\r\nI had several times been the bearer of messages from them to prominent\r\nmen; that we had been taken on faith and the faith had been\r\nalways vindicated. Finally, in order that I might carry away no\r\nmisapprehension, nor convey any, I asked him if it was the intention of\r\nthe manifesto to inhibit any further plural marriage living.\r\n\r\nHe answered, quaintly: \"Why, of course, Frank--because that's what\r\nthey've been persecuting us for.\" There was not even a shrewdness in his\r\nvoice when he added: \"You know they didn't get our brethren in prison\r\nfor polygamy, but for living with their plural wives.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps no other man in Utah could have said such a thing without\r\nsarcasm. The fact was that the United States authorities had been\r\npractically unable to prove a case of polygamy (which was a felony)\r\nbecause the marriage records were concealed by the Church; but they\r\ncould prove plural marriage living (a mere misdemeanor) by repute and\r\ncircumstance. It was part of President Woodruff's unworldliness that he\r\ndid not see the satire of his words; and I was the more convinced of his\r\ngood faith.\r\n\r\nI was convinced also, by several of his remarks, that he had consulted\r\nwith the Church's attorney, Mr. Franklin S. Richards; and while I\r\ntrusted the President's unworldly faith, I trusted more the sagacity\r\nof his more worldly advisers. I began to see, with a sure hope, the\r\nbeginning of the end of all our miseries.\r\n\r\nSome days later I was summoned to attend a meeting of the Church\r\nauthorities in the President's offices; and I knew that the test had\r\ncome. The Church was governed by the Presidency, composed of President\r\nWoodruff and his two Councillor's, with the Quorum of the Twelve\r\nApostles, the Presidents of Seventies, and the presiding Bishopric,\r\ncomposed of three members. These quorums aggregate twenty-five men; and\r\nto their number may be added the Chief Patriarch of the Church, making a\r\nbody of twenty-six general authorities--the Hierarchy. It was from these\r\nlatter men, polygamists and (I feared) parochial in their ignorance of\r\nthe nation and their trust in the protection of their followers--it was\r\nfrom them (and the other practicers of polygamy) that any opposition\r\nwould come to the acceptance and publication of the manifesto.\r\n\r\nThey met--something less than a score of them, with two or three of\r\ntheir most trusted advisers--in one of the general offices of the\r\nPresidency, sitting in leather chairs along its walls, with a sort of\r\ncentral skylight illuminating subduedly the anxiety of their silent\r\nfaces. President Woodruff and his two Councillor's entered to them;\r\nand this insignificant-looking apartment--of such tremendous community\r\nsignificance, because of the memories of its past--seemed to take on the\r\ngravity of another momentous crisis in the destiny of its people. The\r\nportraits in oils of the dead presidents, martyrs, and prophets of\r\nthe Church, looked down on us from the facade of a little gallery, and\r\ncaught my eyes almost hypnotically with the imperturbability of their\r\ngaze. No word from them! In the midst of the broken utterance of\r\nemotion--when the tears were wet on faces to whose manliness tears\r\nwere the very sweat of martyrdom--I saw those immovable countenances as\r\nplacid as the features of the dead.\r\n\r\nPresident Woodruff stood under them, so old and other-worldly, that he\r\nseemed already of their circle rather than ours; and he spoke in a\r\nvoice of feeling for us, but with a simple and courageous finality that\r\nsounded the very note of fate. He had called the brethren together (he\r\nsaid) to submit a decision to their consideration, and he desired from\r\nthem an expression of their willingness to accept and abide by it. He\r\nknew what a trial it would be to the \"whole household of Israel.\" \"We\r\nhave sought,\" he said, \"to live our religion--to harm no one--to perform\r\nour mission in this world for the salvation of the living and the dead.\r\nWe have obeyed the principle of celestial marriage because it came to us\r\nfrom God. We have suffered under the rage of the wicked; we were driven\r\nfrom our homes into the desert; our prophets have been slain, our holy\r\nones persecuted--and it did seem to me that we were entitled to\r\nthe constitutional protection of the courts in the practice of our\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nBut the courts had decided \"against us.\" The great men of the nation\r\nwere determined to show us no mercy. Legislation was impending that\r\nwould put us \"in the power of the wicked.\" Brother George Q. Cannon,\r\nBrother John T. Caine, and the other brethren who had been in\r\nWashington, had found that the situation of the Church was critical.\r\nBrother Franklin S. Richards had advised him that our last legal defense\r\nhad fallen. \"In broken and contrite spirit\" he had sought the will of\r\nthe Lord, and the Holy Spirit had revealed to him that it was necessary\r\nfor the Church to relinquish the practice of that principle for which\r\nthe brethren had been willing to lay down their lives.\r\n\r\nA sort of ghastly stillness accepted what he said as a confirmation\r\nof the worst fears of the men who had evidently come there with some\r\nknowledge of what they were to hear. I glanced at the faces of those\r\nopposite me. A set and staring pallor held them motionless. I was\r\nconscious of a chill of heart that seemed communicated to me from them.\r\nMy brother Abraham was sitting beside me; I knew his deep affection for\r\nhis family; I knew with what a clutch of misery this edict of separation\r\nwas crushing his hope; I felt myself growing as pale and tense as he.\r\n\r\nThe silence was broken by President Woodruff asking one of the brethren\r\nto read the manifesto. When it was concluded, he said: \"The matter is\r\nnow before you. I want you to speak as the Spirit moves you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply, except a sort of general gasp of low-voiced\r\ninterjections and a little buzz of whisperings that sounded like emotion\r\ntaking its breath. He called on my father to speak. The First Councillor\r\nrose to make a statesmanlike review of the crisis; and I understood that\r\nwith his usual diplomacy he was putting aside from him the authority of\r\nleadership until he could see whether an opposition was to develop that\r\nshould make it necessary for him to front it.\r\n\r\nThat opposition made a rustle of stirring in the pause that followed. I\r\nsaw it in the changed expressions of some of the faces. Several of the\r\nmen--including my brother Abraham, and Joseph F. Smith--asked whether\r\nthe manifesto meant a cessation of plural marriages: whether no more\r\nsuch marriages were to be allowed.\r\n\r\nPresident Woodruff answered that it did; that the Lord had taken back\r\nthe principle from the children of men and that we would have no power\r\nto restore it.\r\n\r\nThen they asked whether it meant a cessation of plural marriage\r\nliving--whether they would be required to separate from the wives whom\r\nthey had taken in the holy covenant.\r\n\r\nHe answered, firmly, that it did; that the brethren in Washington found\r\nit imperative; that it was the will of the Lord; that we must submit.\r\n\r\nI saw their faces flush and then slowly pale again--and the storm broke.\r\nOne after another they rose and protested, hoarsely, in the voice of\r\ntears, that they were willing to suffer \"persecution unto death\" rather\r\nthan to violate the covenants which they had made \"in holy places\"\r\nwith the women who had trusted them. One after another they offered\r\nthemselves for any sacrifice but this betrayal of the women and children\r\nto whom they owed an everlasting faith. And a manlier lot of men never\r\nspoke in a manlier way. Not a petty word was uttered. Their thought was\r\nnot for themselves. Their grief was not selfish. Their protests had a\r\ndignity in pathos that shook me in spite of myself.\r\n\r\nWhen they had done, my father rose again with a face that seemed to bear\r\nthe marks of their grief while it repressed his own. He dwelt anew on\r\nthe long efforts of our attorney and our friends in Congress to resist\r\nwhat we believed to be unconstitutional measures to repress our practice\r\nof a religious faith. But we were citizens of a nation. We were\r\nrequired to obey its laws. And when we found, by the highest judicial\r\ninterpretation of statute and constitution, that we were without grounds\r\nfor our plea of religious immunity, we had but the alternative either of\r\ndefying the power of the whole nation or of submitting ourselves to its\r\nauthority. For his part he was willing to do the will of the Lord. And\r\nsince the Prophet of God, after a long season of prayer, had submitted\r\nthis revelation as the will of the Lord, he was ready for the sacrifice.\r\nThe leaders of the Church had no right to think of themselves. They\r\nmust remember how loyally the people had sacrificed their substance and\r\nrisked their safety to guard their brethren who were living in plural\r\nmarriage. Those brethren must not be ungrateful now. They must not now\r\nrefuse to make their sacrifice, in answer to the sacrifices that had\r\nbeen made for them so often. The people had long protected them. Now\r\nthey must protect the people.\r\n\r\nUnder the commanding persuasion of his voice I saw the determination of\r\ntheir resistance begin to falter and relax. President Woodruff called on\r\nme to speak, and I felt that it was my duty to represent the needs,\r\nthe hopes, and the opportunities of the hundreds of thousands of the\r\nundistinguished mass who would make no decision for themselves, but\r\nwhose fate was trembling on the event. I rose to speak for them, with\r\nmy hand on my brother's shoulder, knowing that my every word would be a\r\nstab at his heart, and hoping that my grasp might be a touch of sympathy\r\nto him--knowing that I must urge these elders to sacrifice themselves\r\nand their families for a redemption of which I was to share the\r\nbenefits--but sustained by the remembrance of the solemn pledge which\r\nI had been authorized to give in Washington to honorable men who had\r\ntrusted in our honor--and strengthened by the thought of all those dear,\r\nto me, whose sufferings would be multiplied, with no hope of relief, if\r\nthe few would not now yield to save the many.\r\n\r\nI described the situation as I had seen it in Washington and as I knew\r\nit in Utah from a more intimate personal experience than these leaders\r\ncould have of the sufferings of the people. I told them how cheerfully\r\nand bravely the non-polygamists had borne the brunt of protecting them\r\nin the practice of their faith, and yet how patient a hope had been\r\nalways with us that the final demand might not be made upon us for the\r\nsacrifice of a citizenship which we valued more because it shielded them\r\nthan because it armed us.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the face of President Woodruff, I reminded them that the\r\nsorrow and the parting, at which they rebelled, could only be for a\r\nlittle breath of time, according to their faith; that by the celestial\r\ncovenant, into which they had entered, they were assured that they\r\nshould have their wives and children with them throughout the endless\r\nages of eternity. The people had given much to them. Surely they could\r\nyield the domestic happinesses of the little remaining day of life in\r\nthis world, in order to save and prosper those who were not to enjoy\r\ntheir supreme exaltation of beatitude in the world to come.\r\n\r\nI had felt my brother strong under my hand. He rose, when I concluded.\r\nAnd with a manful brevity he replied that he submitted because it was\r\nthe will of the Lord, and because he had no right to interpose his\r\nselfish love and yearnings between the people of God and their worldly\r\nopportunity. The others followed. Not one referred to the equivocal\r\nlanguage of the manifesto or questioned it. They accepted it--as it was\r\nthen and afterwards interpreted--as a revelation from God made through\r\nthe Prophet of the Church; and they subscribed to it as a solemn\r\ncovenant, before God, with the people of the nation.\r\n\r\nJoseph F. Smith was one of the last to speak. With a face like wax, his\r\nhands outstretched, in an intensity of passion that seemed as if it must\r\nsweep the assembly, he declared that he had covenanted, at the altar\r\nof God's house, in the presence of his Father, to cherish the wives and\r\nchildren whom the Lord had given him. They were more to him than life.\r\nThey were dearer to him than happiness. He would rather choose to stand,\r\nwith them, alone--persecuted--proscribed--outlawed--to wait until God in\r\nHis anger should break the nation with His avenging stroke. But--\r\n\r\nHe dropped his arms. He seemed to shrink in his commanding stature like\r\na man stricken with a paralysis of despair. The tears came to the pained\r\nconstriction of his eyelids.\r\n\r\n\"I have never disobeyed a revelation from God,\" he said. \"I cannot--I\r\ndare not--now.\"\r\n\r\nHe announced--with his head up, though his body swayed--that he would\r\naccept and abide by the revelation. When he sank in his chair and\r\ncovered his face with his hands, there was a gasp of sympathy and\r\nrelief, as if we had been hearing the pain of a man in agony. And my\r\nheart gave a great leap; for, in these supreme moments of feeling,\r\nthings come to us that are larger than our knowledge, more splendid than\r\nour hopes; and I saw, as if in the blinding glisten of the tears in my\r\neyes, a radiant vision of our future, an unselfish people freed from\r\na burden of persecution, a nation's forgiveness born, a grateful state\r\ncreated. I saw it--and I looked at Smith and loved him for it. I knew\r\nthen, as I know now, that he and those others were at this moment\r\nsincere. I knew that they had relinquished what was more dear to them\r\nthan the breath of life. I knew the appalling significance, to them,\r\nof the promise which they were making to the nation. And in all the\r\ndegraded after-years, when so many of them were guilty of breach of\r\ncovenant and base violation of trust, I tried never to forget that in\r\nthe hour of their greatest trial, they had sacrificed themselves for\r\ntheir people; they had suffered for the happiness of others; they had\r\nsaid, sincerely: \"Not my will, O Lord, but Thine, be done!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. On the Road to Freedom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any discussion of the public affairs that make the subject matter of\r\nthis narrative, a line of discrimination must be drawn at the year 1890.\r\nIn that year the Church began a progressive course of submission to\r\nthe civil law, and the nation received each act of surrender with\r\nforgiveness. The previous defiance's of the Mormon people ceased to give\r\ngrounds for a complaint against them. The old harshnesses of the Federal\r\ngovernment were canceled by the new generosity of a placated nation. And\r\nneither party to the present strife in Utah should go back, beyond the\r\nperiod of this composition, to dig up, from the past, its buried wrongs.\r\n\r\nIn relating, here, some of the events of 1888 and 1889, I have tried\r\nneither to justify the Mormons nor to defend their prosecutors. I have\r\nwished merely to make clear the situation in Utah, and to introduce to\r\nyou, in advance, some of the leaders of the distracted community, so\r\nthat you might understand the conditions from which the Mormons escaped\r\nby giving their covenant to the nation and be able to judge of the\r\nobligations and responsibilities of the men who gave it.\r\n\r\nI, have described the promulgation and acceptance of \"the manifesto\"\r\nwith such circumstance and detail, because of what has since occurred in\r\nUtah. Let me add that some two weeks later the General Conference of\r\nthe Church endorsed the President's pronouncement as \"authoritative and\r\nbinding.\" And let me point out that it was the first and only law of the\r\nMormon Church ever so sustained by triple sanctities--\"revealed\" as\r\na command from God, accepted by the prophets in solemn fraternity\r\nassembled, and ratified by the vote of the entire \"congregation of\r\nIsrael\" before it was declared to be binding upon men.\r\n\r\nAt first, because of the somewhat indefinite promise of the message\r\nitself, many of the non-Mormons of Utah remained suspicious and in\r\ndoubt of it. But it was recognized by Judge Zane, in court--on the\r\nday following the close of the Conference--as an official declaration,\r\n\"honest and sincere.\" The newspapers throughout the whole country so\r\nreceived it. The Church authorities sent assurances to Washington that\r\nconvinced the statesmen, there, of the completeness and finality of the\r\nsubmission. And the good faith of the covenant was at last admitted by\r\nthe non-Mormons of Utah and endorsed by their trust. I do not know\r\nof any change in human affairs dependent on human will--more speedy,\r\neffective and comprehensive than this recession. Within the space of a\r\nfew days a revolution was completed that had been sought by the power\r\nof our nation and of the civilized world, for a generation, with stripes\r\nand imprisonment, death, confiscation and the ostracism of the country's\r\npublic contempt. It had been obtained, I knew, chiefly by the sagacity\r\nof the First Councillor using the pressure of circumstances to enforce\r\nthe persuasions of diplomacy. I felt that a miracle of change had been\r\nbrought to pass. He had placed us on the road to freedom; and I trusted\r\nhis guidance to lead us to our goal.\r\n\r\nThat goal, to me personally, was the honor of American citizenship--an\r\nambition that had been an obsession with me from my earliest youth. I\r\nhad never heard a man on a railroad train talk of how he was going to\r\nvote in a national election, without feeling a pang of shamed envy;\r\nfor my lack of citizenship seemed a mark of inferiority. The patriotic\r\nreading of my boyhood had made the American republic, to me, the noblest\r\nadministration of freemen in the history of government and the exercise\r\nof its franchise literally the highest dignity of human privilege. I\r\nwould have been as proud--I was as proud when the day came--to vote for\r\nthe President of the United States as he could have been to take his\r\noath of office. I do not believe that any poor serf, escaped from the\r\ntyranny of Russia, ever saw the American shore with a more grateful eye\r\nthan I looked to the prospect of being admitted, with the citizens of\r\nUtah, into the enfranchisement of the Republic.\r\n\r\nBut it was evident that the Church's recession from polygamy would not\r\nbe enough to free us, so long as its control of politics remained. Its\r\nother practices had flourished and been sheltered under its political\r\npower; and now that the Church had ceased to be a lawbreaker, our\r\nfriends in Washington were properly expecting that it would cease to\r\ninterfere with its members in the exercise of their citizenship. For\r\nthis reason, when I was notified that I had been selected as a member of\r\nthe advisory committee of the People's Party (the Church party), I went\r\nat once to my father and told him that I would not take the place;\r\nthat I intended to work, personally, and through my newspaper, for the\r\npolitical division of Utah on the lines of the national parties. He held\r\nthat until Gentile solidarity was dissolved, it would be dangerous to\r\ndivide the allegiance of the Mormons; but he did not stand against\r\nmy protest; he contented himself--diplomatically--with sending me to\r\nconsult with President Woodruff and Joseph F. Smith.\r\n\r\nTo them, I argued that the political emancipation of the Mormon people\r\nfrom ecclesiastical direction was as necessary as the recession from\r\npolygamy had been. We must be set free to perform our duty to the\r\ncountry solely as citizens of the country, before we could expect to be\r\ngiven the right to perform it at all. And, for my part, the only action\r\nI would consent to take as a member of the advisory committee of the\r\nPeople's Party would be to vote for the dissolution of the party.\r\n\r\nPresident Woodruff referred me to my father, and advised me to be guided\r\nby him. Joseph F. Smith urged that a division of the Mormon people on\r\nnational party lines would enable the Liberal (the Gentile) party to\r\nmarch in between. I argued in reply that we must divide at some time,\r\nand the sooner the better, since every year was increasing the Gentile\r\npopulation. They would never split as long as we remained solid. And if\r\nwe were ever to be permitted to nationalize ourselves, it would not be\r\nuntil we had dissolved the party organizations whose very names were a\r\nproof of the continued rule of the Church in politics.\r\n\r\nWhen he had no more arguments to advance, he gave a reluctant assent to\r\nmine. I reported back to my father and he approved of my plans. He asked\r\nme humorously with whom I expected to affiliate, since he knew of no one\r\nwho was likely to go with me; but I could see that he was pleased with\r\nmy independence and hoped I might succeed in doing something to break\r\nthe deadlock-grapple of Mormon and Gentile that held Utah apart from the\r\nrest of the country in politics.\r\n\r\nHis humorous idea of my undertaking gave its color to my beginnings.\r\nIt was rather a spirited adventure, as I look back upon it now. When we\r\norganized a Republican Club at Ogden, my intimate friend, Ben E. Rich,\r\nand another friend named Joseph Belnap, were the only Mormons, so far\r\nas I know, who joined me in becoming members. Outside of us three, I did\r\nnot know of another Mormon Republican in the whole territory.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the status of the Mormon people, in their fancied relation to\r\nthe two great parties of the country, was almost identical with that of\r\nthe people of the South after the Civil War. Practically every Mormon\r\nbelieved himself to be a Democrat. Among the young men of the Church\r\nthere had been occasional attempts to form Democratic Clubs. Mr. John\r\nT. Caine, delegate in Congress from the territory, was a Democrat. My\r\nfather had sat on the Democratic side of the House. Almost all the men\r\nwho had braved the sentiments of their own states, to speak for us in\r\nCongress, had been Democrats. And, of course, the administration of the\r\nlaws that had been so cruel to the feelings of the Mormons had been in\r\nRepublican hands.\r\n\r\nTwo years earlier, in Ogden, I had spoken in a meeting of Republicans\r\nthat had been called to rejoice over the election of Benjamin Harrison\r\nto the Presidency; and I was still being taunted by my Mormon friends\r\nwith having clasped hands with \"the persecutors of the Prophets.\" When\r\nI came out, now, as an advocate of Republicanism, I was met everywhere\r\nwith this charge--that I had joined the enemies of the Church, that\r\nI was assisting the persecutors of my father. The fact that my father\r\napproved of what I was doing, relieved the seriousness of the situation\r\nfor me; and the humorous assistance of Ben Rich in our political\r\nevangelism gave a secret chuckle to many of the incidents of our\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nWe went from town to town, from district to district, up the\r\nmountain valleys, across the plains, into mining camps and farming\r\ncommunities--using the meeting-houses, the school-rooms, the town\r\nhalls--taking the afternoon to coax the tired workers of the fields or\r\nof the mines to come and hear us in the evening, and watching them fall\r\nasleep in the light of our borrowed kerosene lamps while we talked. They\r\ncame eagerly. Indeed, my own ambition for citizenship--for a right to\r\nparticipate in the affairs of the nation--was probably no keener than\r\ntheirs; and they had an innocent curiosity about the questions of\r\nnational politics, of which they had never before been invited to know\r\nanything. They listened almost devoutly.\r\n\r\n\"Brethren and sisters,\" a bishop exhorted them at a meeting in which one\r\nof our party was to speak, \"we have come to listen to this man, and I\r\nhope we will be guided in all our reflections by the Spirit of God\r\nand that we will do nothing to offend that Spirit. Let there be no\r\ncommotion, no whispering, and, above all, no hand clapping.\"\r\n\r\nIn a life that had as few diversions as theirs, a political meeting was\r\nan exciting event. The whole family came, and the mothers brought their\r\nbabies. Surely in no other American community did politics ever have\r\nsuch a homely and serious consideration. Certainly no other community\r\nwould have so quickly understood the theories of the two parties or\r\naccepted them so implicitly.\r\n\r\nBut it was all theory! I recognize, now, that I preached a Republicanism\r\nthat was an ideal of what it should be, rather than any modern faith\r\nof the \"practical politician.\" I had gathered it from my reading, from\r\nhearing the speeches in Congress, from sympathetic conferences with the\r\ngreat men who were responsible for the dogmas of the party; and every\r\nassurance of grace that their ability could give and my credulity\r\naccept, I proclaimed religiously as a political salvation to our people.\r\nI built up an ideal, and then judged the party thereafter according to\r\nthe measure of that ideal. When I found that some of the charges\r\nagainst the Republican party were true--charges which I had indignantly\r\nrepelled--I was as shocked as any pious worshipper who ever found that\r\nhis idol had feet of clay. Our people, having accepted the faith with as\r\nsimple a hope as it was offered, were as easily turned from it when they\r\nfound that it was false. The political moods of Utah, for its first\r\nfew years of statehood, were a puzzle to the \"practical\" leaders of the\r\nparties; but to us who understood the impulses of honesty that moved the\r\nchanges, things were as clear as they were encouraging.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous summer in Washington, I had met General James S.\r\nClarkson, then president of the National League of Republican Clubs;\r\nand now, on his invitation, in the Spring of 1891, Rich and I went\r\nto Louisville to speak before the national convention of the league.\r\nThrough the kindness of General Clarkson, I was given the official\r\nrecognition of a perfunctory place on the executive committee of the\r\nleague's national committee, and came into touch with many of the party\r\nleaders. It was about this time, I imagine, that they conceived the idea\r\nof using the gratitude of the Mormons in order to carry Utah and the\r\nsurrounding states in which the Mormon vote might constitute a balance\r\nof political power. I know that the idea was old and established when\r\nI came upon it, in 1894, during the campaign for statehood. As I also\r\nfound, still later, the Republican leaders and the business interests\r\nwith which they were in relation, had their eyes on a distant prospect\r\nof fabulous financial schemes in which the secret funds of the Church\r\nwere to help in the building of railroads and the promoting of other\r\nenterprises of associated capital. But at the time of which I am\r\nwriting, I had not had sufficient experience to suspect the motives of\r\nthe men who encouraged our work in Utah; and I accepted in good faith\r\ntheir public declarations that the sole aim of the party was to serve\r\nthe needs of the people of the United States--and therefore of the\r\npeople of Utah!\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that such a noble principle should win the support of\r\nMormon and Gentile alike, and it was on this principle that I appealed\r\nfor the support of both. I was so sure of winning with it that I\r\nresented and fought against the aid of the Church that came to us as our\r\ncampaign succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe People's Party (the Church Party) had been dissolved (June, 1891)\r\nby the formal action of the executive committee, under the direct\r\ninstruction of the leaders of the Church. The tendency was for its\r\nmembers to organize themselves immediately as a Democratic party.\r\nThey were led by such brilliant and trusted defenders of the Church as\r\nFranklin S. Richards, Chas. C. Richards, Wm. H. King, James H. Moyle,\r\nBrigham H. Roberts and Apostle Moses Thatcher; and a group of abler\r\nadvocates could not have been found in any state in the Union. It was\r\nagainst the sentiment of the Mormon people, vivified by such inspiring\r\nDemocracy as these men taught, that our little organization of\r\nRepublicans had to make headway; and an anxiety began to show\r\nitself among the Church authorities for a less unequal division, and\r\nconsequently a greater appearance of political independence, among the\r\nfaithful.\r\n\r\nApostle John Henry Smith came out as a Republican stump speaker in\r\nrivalry with Moses Thatcher, the Democratic Prophet. Joseph F. Smith\r\nannounced himself a Republican descendant of Whigs. Apostle Francis\r\nMarion Lyman, in his religious ministrations, counselled leading\r\nbrethren to withhold themselves from the Democratic party unless they\r\nhad gone too far to retreat. Men of ecclesiastical office in various\r\nparts of the territory--who were regarded as being safe in their wisdom\r\nand fidelity--were urged to hold themselves and their influence in\r\nreserve for such use on either side of politics as the future might\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nAgainst this ecclesiastical direction of the people's choice, I objected\r\nagain and again to the Presidency, and my objections seemed to meet with\r\nacquiescence. It required no prescience on my part to foresee that the\r\ngrowing dislike and distrust of Moses Thatcher at Church headquarters\r\nwould lead to a strife in the Church that might be carried into our\r\npolitics; and I knew how small would be the hope of preserving any\r\npolitical independence, if once it were involved in the intrigues of\r\npriests and their rivalries for a supremacy of influence among the\r\npeople. I was resolved that not even a Church, ruling by \"divine\r\nright,\" should interpose between my country and my franchise; and an\r\nencroachment that I would not permit upon my own freedom, I would not\r\nhelp to inflict upon others.\r\n\r\nThe men with whom I had been working proposed me as the candidate for\r\nCongress of the new Utah Republicans; and I was supported by a strong\r\ndelegation from my own country and from other parts of the territory;\r\nbut I found that I was not \"satisfactory\" to some of the Mormon leaders,\r\nand in the convention (1892) Apostle John Henry Smith and my cousin\r\nGeorge M. Cannon led in an attempt to nominate Judge Chas. Bennett, a\r\nGentile lawyer. After a bitter fight of two days and nights, we carried\r\nthe convention against them, and I was nominated.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats selected, as their candidate, one of the strongest\r\ncharacters in the territory, Joseph L. Rawlins. He was the son of a\r\nMormon bishop, but he had left the Church immediately upon reaching\r\nmanhood. He was a great lawyer, a staunch Democrat, and wonderfully\r\npopular. There followed one of the swiftest and most exciting campaigns\r\never seen in Utah. The whole people rose to it with enthusiasm. Our\r\nparty chairman, Chas. Crane, had a genius for organization; our speakers\r\ndrew crowded meetings; and though charges of Church influence were\r\nmade by both sides, the question of religion was no longer the one that\r\ndivided Utah.\r\n\r\nWe were getting on famously, when an incident occurred that was at once\r\ndisastrous and salutary. While I was away from headquarters, stumping\r\nthe districts, Chairman Crane (who was a Gentile), Ben Rich and Joseph\r\nF. Smith, issued a pamphlet in Republican behalf called \"Nuggets of\r\nTruth.\" It gave a picture of Joseph Smith, the original Prophet, on\r\nthe first page and a picture of me on the last one. (They issued also\r\na certificate, obtained by Joseph F. Smith and given out by him, that\r\nI was a Mormon \"in good standing.\") As soon as I heard of the matter,\r\nI wired Chairman Crane that unless the pamphlet were immediately\r\nwithdrawn, I should return to Salt Lake City and publicly denounce such\r\nmethods. It was withdrawn, but the damage was done, I was defeated, as\r\nI deserved to be--though I was the innocent victim of the atrocity--and\r\nMr. Rawlins was elected.\r\n\r\nThe campaign proved, however, that if the Church leaders would only\r\nkeep their hands off, there was ample strength in either party to make\r\na presentation of national issues of sufficient appeal to divide the\r\npeople on party lines; and it was evident that the people would choose\r\nthe party that made the best showing of principles and candidates.\r\n\"Nuggets of Truth\" left us with a nasty sense that at no hour were we\r\nassured of safety from ecclesiastical interference--or the nefarious\r\nattempt to make an appearance of such interference--in our political\r\naffairs. But the disaster that followed, in this instance, was so prompt\r\nthat we could hope it would prove a lesson.\r\n\r\nMost important of all, the campaign had made it evident that there\r\nwas now no political mission in Utah for the Liberal (the Gentile)\r\nparty--assuming that the retirement of the Mormon priests from politics\r\nwas sincere and permanent. Accordingly, the organization formally met\r\nsome months later, and formally dissolved; and, by that act, the\r\nlast great obstacle to united progress was removed from our road to\r\nstatehood, and the men who removed it acted with a generosity that\r\nmakes one of the noblest records of self-sacrifice in the history of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThey could foresee that their dissolution as a separate force meant\r\nstatehood for Utah--a sovereignty in itself that would leave the\r\nGentiles in the minority and without any appeal to the nation. Under\r\nterritorial conditions, although the non-Mormons were less than\r\none-third of the population, they had two-thirds of the political power.\r\nThey held all the Federal offices, including executive and judicial\r\npositions. They had the Governor, with an absolute veto over the acts\r\nof the Mormon legislature. They had the President and Congress who could\r\nannul any statute of the territory; and they had with them almost the\r\nentire sentiment of the nation. It was in their power to have protracted\r\nthe Mormon controversy, and to have withstood the appeal for statehood,\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nThey yielded everything; they accepted, in return, only the good faith\r\nof the Mormons. Was it within the capacity of any human mind to foresee\r\nthat in return for such generosity the Church would ever give over its\r\ntabernacles to teaching its people to hold in detestation the very,\r\nnames of these men who saved us? Was it to be suspected that the\r\npolitical power surrendered by them would ever be used as a persecution\r\nupon them?--that the liberty, given by them to us, would ever afterward\r\nbe denied them by us? It was inconceivable. Neither in the magnanimity\r\nof their minds nor in the gratitude of ours was there a suspicion of\r\nsuch a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nDuring 1891, President Woodruff's manifesto had been ratified in local\r\nChurch conferences in every \"stake of Zion;\" and a second General\r\nConference had endorsed it in October of that year. President Woodruff,\r\nCouncillor Joseph F. Smith and Apostle Lorenzo Snow went before the\r\nFederal Master in Chancery--in a proceeding to regain possession of\r\nescheated Church property--and swore that the manifesto had prohibited\r\nplural marriages, that it required a cessation of all plural marriage\r\nliving, and that it was being obeyed by the Mormon people. These facts\r\nwere recited in a petition for amnesty forwarded to President Harrison\r\nin December, 1891, accompanied by signed statements from Chief Justice\r\nZane, Governor Thomas and other non-Mormons who pledged themselves that\r\nthe petitioners were sincere and that if amnesty were granted good faith\r\nwould be kept. \"Our people are scattered,\" President Woodruff and his\r\napostles declared in their petition. \"Homes are made desolate. Many are\r\nstill imprisoned; others are banished and in hiding. Our hearts bleed\r\nfor these. In the past they followed our counsels, and while they are\r\nstill afflicted our souls are in sackcloth and ashes.... As shepherds\r\nof a patient and suffering people we ask amnesty for them and pledge our\r\nfaith and honor for their future.\"\r\n\r\nAt Washington, the Church's attorney, Mr. Franklin S. Richards, and\r\ndelegate John T. Caine supported the petition with their avowals of\r\nthe sincerity of the Church leaders, the genuineness of our political\r\ndivision, and the sanctity with which we regarded the promise to obey\r\nthe laws. The Utah Commission, a non-Mormon body, favored amnesty in an\r\nofficial report of September, 1892. And when I went to Washington, in\r\nthe winter of 1892-3, the changed attitude of the Federal authorities\r\ntoward us was strikingly evident.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison issued his amnesty proclamation, early in January,\r\n1893, to all persons liable to the penalties of the Edmunds-Tucker Act,\r\nbut \"on the express condition that they shall in the future faithfully\r\nobey the laws of the United States... and not otherwise.\" The\r\nproclamation concluded: \"Those who fail to avail themselves of the\r\nclemency hereby offered will be vigorously prosecuted.\" Not a polygamist\r\nin Utah, to my knowledge, declined to take advantage of the mercy, by\r\nrefusing the expressly implied pledge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the campaign had been continued for the return of the\r\nescheated Church property and for the passage of an Enabling Act that\r\nshould permit the territory to organize for statehood.\r\n\r\n[FOOTNOTE: Statehood seemed still very faraway. There was a\r\nTrans-Mississippi Congress held at Ogden in 1892, and though the\r\ndelegates--coming from all the states and territories \"west of the\r\nriver,\" were the guests of the people of Utah, so hopeless was our\r\nstatus in the consideration of mankind that the delegates from the\r\nterritories of New Mexico and Arizona would not let our names be joined\r\nto theirs in a resolution for statehood which we wished the committee\r\non resolutions to propose to the Congress. Governor Prince of New Mexico\r\nreplied, to our plea for a share in the resolution, that he did not\r\nintend to damn New Mexico by having her mixed up with Utah. We appealed\r\nto the Congress, and we were saved by a speech made by Thos. M.\r\nPatterson of Colorado, subsequently senator from Colorado, who carried\r\nthe day for us. At a recent Trans-Mississippi Congress held in Denver,\r\nI sat with ex-Senator Patterson to hear Mr. Prince still proposing\r\nresolutions in support of statehood for New Mexico. Twenty years later!]\r\nJoseph L. Rawlins, Democratic delegate from Utah, worked valiantly among\r\nthe Democrats, and he was assisted by the influence of Mr. Franklin S.\r\nRichards and John T. Caine and others among their old associates in that\r\nparty. But, in the very midst of the fight, we were advised that,\r\nunless the Republican leaders would let the Enabling Act go through, the\r\nDemocratic leaders would falter in our advocacy.\r\n\r\nI had been urged to go to Washington by the Presidency to do what I\r\nmight to allay Republican antagonism, and I found that a number of\r\nself-appointed lobbyists (who expected political preferment's and other\r\nrewards from the Church in the event of statehood) had been using the\r\nmost amazing arguments in our behalf. For example, they told some of\r\nthe \"financial Senators\" that the Church had fourteen million dollars in\r\nsecret funds with which to help build a railroad to the coast as soon\r\nas statehood should be granted. They cited the number of the Church's\r\nadherents in all the states and territories of the Pacific Coast and as\r\nfar east as Iowa and Missouri, and predicted that the gratitude of these\r\npeople to the Republicans who were helping to free Utah would enable the\r\nRepublican party to control a balance of political power in the several\r\nstates. They declared positively that plural marriages and plural\r\nmarriage living had utterly ceased among the Mormons for all time. And\r\nthey made such statements with great particularity to Senator Orville H.\r\nPlatt, of Connecticut, who was too wise a man to credit them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I returned to Washington, he summoned me to a private\r\nmeeting, in his parlor in the Arlington Hotel, and confronted me with\r\none of the Republican lobbyists who had been soliciting his personal\r\nfavor and his almost controlling influence. \"Now, Mr. Cannon,\" he said,\r\nin his dry way, \"have the Mormons stopped living with their plural\r\nwives? And will there never be another case of plural marriage among\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\nI remembered the lesson of my interview with him at the time of the\r\ncampaign against the disfranchisement bill, and I answered: \"No. Not\r\nall the men of the Church have complied fully with the law. So far as\r\nI know, all the general authorities of the Church--with two or three\r\nexceptions--are fulfilling the covenant they gave; and so far as I can\r\njudge there will never be another plural marriage ceremony with the\r\nconsent or connivance of the leaders of the Church. But human nature is\r\nvery much the same in Utah as it is in Connecticut. Here and there, no\r\ndoubt, a man feels that he's under an obligation to keep his covenant\r\nwith his plural wives in preference to the covenant of his accepted\r\namnesty; and there and here, possibly, in the future, some man will\r\nbreak the law and defy the orders of the Church and take a plural wife.\r\nBut the leaders of the Church do not countenance either proceeding, and\r\nany man who violates the law, in either respect, offends against the\r\nrevelations of the Church and, I believe, will be dealt with as an\r\napostate. I come direct from the Presidency of the Church, and I am\r\nauthorized to pledge their word of honor that they will themselves obey\r\nthe law and do all in their power as men and leaders to bring their\r\npeople into harmony with the institutions of this country as rapidly as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Platt had slowly unwrapped himself, rising from his chair to his\r\nfull height of more than six feet, in a lank and alarming indignation.\r\n\"There,\" he said, striding up and down the room. \"That's it! That's just\r\nit. These people have been telling us that you were obeying the law--all\r\nof you--in every instance--and would always obey it. And now you come\r\nhere and admit, openly, that some of you, to whom we have granted\r\namnesty, are breaking your word--and that 'possibly' others, in the\r\nfuture, will do the same thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Senator,\" I pleaded, \"what confidence could you have in me if I were to\r\ntell you the Mormons were so superhuman that in a single day they could\r\neliminate all their human characteristics? I'm asking you to recognize\r\nthat the tendency imparted to a whole community is more important\r\nthan any one man's breach of the law. Believe me, if you grant us our\r\nstatehood, there will never be any lawbreaking sanctioned or protected\r\nby the Church leaders, and just as speedily as possible the entire\r\nsystem will be brought into harmony with the institutions of the nation.\r\nI'm telling you the truth.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned on me to ask, abruptly, how the polygamists had adjusted their\r\nfamily affairs.\r\n\r\nI answered that in nearly all cases within my personal knowledge, the\r\npolygamist had relinquished conjugal relations with his plural wives\r\nwith the full acquiescence of them and their children. He supported\r\nthem, cared for the children, and in all other ways acted as the\r\nguardian and protector of the household. In a few cases men had gone,\r\nto an extreme. For instance, my uncle, Angus M. Cannon--president of the\r\nSalt Lake \"stake of Zion,\" a man of most decided character--had declared\r\nthat he had entered into his marriage relations with his wives under a\r\ncovenant that gave them equality in his regards; and in order that he\r\nmight not wound the sensibilities of any, he had separated himself from\r\nall.\r\n\r\nI reminded Senator Platt that with such examples on the part of the\r\nleaders, there could be no general law-breaking among the Mormons, and\r\nthat gradually the polygamous element would accommodate itself to the\r\ndemands of law and the commands of God.\r\n\r\nHe waved us away with a curt announcement that he would have to think\r\nthe matter over. If I had not known the essential justice and common\r\nsense under his dry and irascible exterior, I might have been alarmed.\r\nThe lobbyist's concern was almost comic. As soon as we were out of\r\nhearing of the Senator's apartment, shaking both fists frantically at\r\nme, he cried: \"You've ruined everything! We had him. We had him--all\r\nright--until you came down here and let the cat out of the bag! You knew\r\nwhat we'd been telling him. Why didn't you stick to it?\"\r\n\r\nI replied with equal warmth: \"You may lie all you please; but if we have\r\nto win Utah's statehood with lies I don't want it. Senator Platt has\r\nbeen generous to us in our time of need, and I don't intend to deceive\r\nhim--or any other man.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, this was not only common honesty; it was also the\r\nbest policy. Senator Platt was, from that time to the day of his death,\r\na good friend and wise counselor of the people of Utah. And I wish to\r\nlay particular stress upon this conversation with him, because it was\r\na type of many had with such men as he. Fred T. Dubois, delegate in\r\nCongress from the territory of Idaho and subsequently Senator from that\r\nstate, had been perhaps the strongest single opponent, in Washington, of\r\nthe Mormon Church; he took our promises of honor, as Senator Platt did,\r\nand he pacified Senator Cullom, Senator Pettigrew and many others among\r\nour antagonists, who afterwards told me that they had accepted the\r\npledges given by Senator Dubois in our behalf.\r\n\r\nThey recognized that the Church and the community ought not to be\r\nheld responsible for a few possible cases of individual resistance or\r\noffense, so long as there should be a strict adherence by the Church and\r\nits leaders to their personal and community covenant. I emphasize the\r\nnature of this generous appreciation of our difficulties, because\r\nthe present-day polygamists in Utah claim that there was a \"tacit\r\nunderstanding,\" between the statesmen in Washington and the agents\r\nof the Church, to the effect that the polygamists of that time might\r\ncontinue to live with their plural wives. This is not true. There never\r\nwas any such understanding, to my knowledge. And there could not have\r\nbeen one, in the circumstances, without my knowledge. For though I\r\ndid not know what delegate Rawlins, and former delegate Caine, and our\r\nattorney, Mr. Richards, were saying in their private interviews with\r\nsenators and congressmen, I know that in all the frequent conversations\r\nI had with them I never heard an intimation of any \"tacit understanding\"\r\nbeyond the one which I have defined.\r\n\r\nFor my part I was more than eager to have all our political disabilities\r\nremoved, the Church property restored, and the right of statehood\r\naccorded--believing implicitly in the sincerity of the Mormon leaders. I\r\nknew President Woodruff too well to doubt the pellacid character of his\r\nmind and purpose. I knew from my father's personal assurance--and from\r\nhis constant practice from that time to the day of his death--that he\r\nwas acting in good faith. I knew that the community was gladly following\r\nwhere these men led. I saw no slightest indication that any reactionary\r\npolicy was likely to be entered upon in Utah, or that our people would\r\naccept it if it were.\r\n\r\nThe Church's personal property was restored by an Act of Congress\r\napproved October 25, 1893, but it was stipulated in the Act that the\r\nmoney was not to be used for the support of any church buildings in\r\nwhich \"the rightfulness of the practice of polygamy\" should be taught.\r\nSimilarly, when the Enabling Act was approved, in July 16, 1894,\r\nit, too, provided that \"polygamous or plural marriage\" was forever\r\nprohibited. A constitutional convention was held at Salt Lake City under\r\nthe provisions of that act, and a constitution was adopted in which\r\nit was provided that \"polygamous or plural marriages\" were forever\r\nprohibited, that the territorial laws against polygamy were to be\r\ncontinued in force, that there should be \"no union of church and state,\"\r\nand that no church should \"dominate the state or interfere with its\r\nfunctions.\" Upon no other basis would the nation have granted us our\r\nstatehood; and we accepted the grant, knowing the expressed condition\r\ninvolved in that acceptance.\r\n\r\nBut there was one other gift that came to us from the nation--by\r\nCongressional enactment and later by Utah statute as a consequence of\r\nstatehood; and that gift was the legitimizing of every child born\r\nof plural marriage before January, 1896. The solemn benignity of the\r\nconcession touched me, as it must have touched many, to the very heart\r\nof gratitude. By it, ten thousand children were taken from the outer\r\ndarkness of this world's conventional exclusion and placed within\r\nthe honored relations of mankind. It was a tribute to the purity\r\nand sincerity of the Mormon women who had borne the cross of plural\r\nmarriage, believing that God had commanded their suffering. It\r\nrecognized the holy nature and honorable intent of the marriages\r\nof these women, by according their children every right of legal\r\ninheritance from their fathers. If all other covenants could be\r\nforgotten and their proof obliterated, this should remain as Utah's\r\npledge of honor--sacred for the sake of the Mormon mothers, holy in the\r\nname of the uplifted child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. The Goal--And After\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we were then (as I saw the situation) assured of our statehood,\r\nrid of polygamy, relieved of religious control in politics, and free to\r\ndevote our energies to the development of the land and the industries\r\nand the business of the community. The persecutions that our people had\r\nborne had schooled them to co-operation. They were ready, helping one\r\nanother, to advance together to a common prosperity. They were under\r\nthe leadership chiefly of the man who had guided them out of a most\r\ndesperate condition of oppression toward the freedom of sovereign\r\nself-government. In that progress he had saved everything that was\r\nworthy in the Mormon communism; he had discarded much that was a curse.\r\nI knew that he had no thought but for the welfare of the people; and\r\nwith such a man, leading such a following, we seemed certain of a future\r\nthat should be an example to the world.\r\n\r\nBut both the Church and the people had been involved in debt by\r\nconfiscation and proscription; and it was necessary now to free\r\nourselves financially. This work my father undertook in behalf of the\r\nPresidency--for the President of the Mormon Church is not only the\r\nProphet, Seer and Revelator of God to the faithful; he is also \"the\r\ntrustee in trust\" of all the Church's material property. He is the\r\ncontroller, almost the owner, of everything it owns. He is as sacred in\r\nhis financial as in his religious absolutism. He is accountable to no\r\none, The Church auditors, whom he appoints, concern themselves merely\r\nwith the details of bookkeeping. The millions of dollars that are paid\r\nto him, by the people in tithes, are used by him as he sees fit to use\r\nthem; and the annual contributors to this \"common fund\" would no more\r\nquestion his administration of it than they would question the ways of\r\ndivinity.\r\n\r\nIn the early days there had been a strongly animating idea that among\r\nthe divinely-authorized duties of leadership was the obligation to\r\ndevelop the natural resources of the country in order to meet the\r\npeople's needs. As the immigrants poured into Utah, these needs\r\nincreased; and the Church leaders used the Church funds to develop coal\r\nand iron mines, support salt gardens, build a railway, establish a sugar\r\nfactory (for which the people, through the legislature, voted a bounty),\r\nconduct a beach resort, and aid a hundred other enterprises that\r\npromised to be for the public good. These undertakings were not financed\r\nfor profit. They were semi-socialistic in their establishment and\r\nhalf-benevolent in their administration.\r\n\r\nBut during \"the days of the raid\" they were neglected, because the\r\nChurch was involved in debt. And now it became pressingly necessary to\r\nobtain money to restore the moribund industries and to meet the payments\r\nthat were continually falling due upon loans made to the Presidency.\r\nPresident Woodruff called on me to aid in the work. So I came into touch\r\nwith a development of events that did not seem to me, then, of any great\r\nimportance; yet it drew as its consequence a connection between the\r\nMormon Church and the great financial \"interests\" of the East--a\r\nconnection that is one of the strong determining causes of the\r\nperversion of government and denial of political liberty in Utah today.\r\n\r\nI wish, here, simply to foreshadow, this connection. It will reappear in\r\nthe story again and again; and it is necessary to have the significance\r\nof the recurrence understood in advance. But, at the time of which\r\nI write, there was no more than an innocent approach on our part to\r\nEastern financiers to obtain money for the Church and to concentrate our\r\ndebts in the hands of two or three New York banks.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Church had loaned to, or endorsed for, the Utah Sugar\r\nCompany to the amount of $325,000; and my father had personally endorsed\r\nthe general obligations for this and other sums, although he owned\r\nonly $5,000 of the company's stock. He supported the factory with his\r\npersonal credit and assumed the risk of loss (without any corresponding\r\npossibility of gain) in order to benefit the whole people by encouraging\r\nthe beet sugar industry. A vain attempt had been made to sell the bonds\r\nin New York. Finally, the Church bought all the bonds of the company\r\nfor $325,000 (of a face value of $400,000), and we sold them, for the\r\nChurch, to Mr. Joseph Bannigan, the \"rubber king,\" of Providence, Rhode\r\nIsland, for $360,000, with the guarantee of the First Presidency, the\r\ntrustee of the Church, and myself.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the First Presidency led in building an electric power plant\r\nin Ogden, after Chas. K. Bannister, a great engineer, and myself had\r\npersuaded the members of the Presidency that the work would benefit the\r\ncommunity. The bonds of this company, too, were bought by Mr. Bannigan,\r\nwith the guarantee of the trustee of the Church, the Presidency and\r\nmyself. Both the power plant and the sugar factory were financially\r\nsuccessful. They performed a large public service beneficently. The fact\r\nthat Mr. Bannigan held their bonds was no detriment to their work and\r\nwrought no injury to the people.\r\n\r\nI single out these two enterprises because Joseph F. Smith has since\r\nsold the power plant to the \"Harriman interests,\" and the control of the\r\nsugar factory to the sugar trust; and he has explained that in making\r\nthe sales he merely followed my father's example and mine in selling\r\nthe bonds to Mr. Bannigan. The power plant is now a part of the merger\r\ncalled the Utah Light and Railway Company, which has a monopoly right\r\nin all the streets of Salt Lake City and its suburbs, besides owning\r\nthe electric power and light plants of Salt Lake City and Ogden, the gas\r\nplants of both these cities, and the natural gas wells and pipe\r\nlines supplying them. The Mormon people whose tithes aided these\r\nproperties--whose good-will maintained them--whose leaders designed them\r\nas a community work for a community benefit--these people are now being\r\nmercilessly exploited by the Eastern \"interests\" to whom the Prophet\r\nof the Church has sold them bodily. The difference between selling\r\nthe bonds of the sugar company to Bannigan, in order to raise money to\r\nsupport the factory, and selling half the stock to the sugar trust, in\r\norder to make a monopoly profit out of the Mormon consumers of sugar,\r\nhas either not occurred to Smith or has been divinely waived by him.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is by the way and in advance of my story. In 1894 we had\r\nno more fear of the Eastern money power than we had of the return of\r\nthe Church to politics or to polygamy. Throughout 1893 and 1894 I was\r\nengaged in the work of re-establishing the Church's business affairs\r\nwith my father and a sort of finance committee of which the other two\r\nmembers were Colonel N. W. Clayton, of Salt Lake City, and Mr. James\r\nJack, the cashier of the Church. In the summer of 1894 I heard various\r\nrumors that when Utah should gain its statehood, my father would\r\nprobably be a candidate for the United States Senate. Since this would\r\nbe a palpable breach of the Church's agreement to keep out of politics,\r\nI took occasion--one day, on a railroad journey--to ask him if he\r\nintended to be a candidate.\r\n\r\nHe told me that he was being urged to stand for the Senatorship, but\r\nthat for his part he had no desire to do so; and he asked me what I\r\nthought about it. I replied that if I had felt it was right for him\r\nto take the office and he desired it, I would walk barefoot across the\r\ncontinent to aid him. But I reminded him of the pledges which he and I\r\nhad made repeatedly--on our own behalf, in the name of his associates in\r\nleadership, and on the honor of the Mormon people--to subdue thereafter\r\nthe causes of the controversy that had divided Mormon and Gentile in\r\nUtah. He replied with an emphatic assurance of his purpose to keep those\r\npledges, and dismissed the subject with a finality that left no doubt in\r\nmy mind.\r\n\r\nI know that he might have desired the Senatorship as a public\r\nvindication, since, in the old days of quarrel, he had been legislated\r\nout of his place in the House of Representatives; and, for the first\r\nand only time in my life, I undertook to philosophize some comfort for\r\nhim--out of the fact that to the position of authority which he held in\r\nUtah a Senatorship was a descent. He replied dryly: \"I understand, my\r\nson--perfectly.\" The fact was that he needed no comfort from me or any\r\nother human being. He seemed all--sufficient to himself, because of the\r\nabiding sense he had of the constant presence of God and his habit of\r\ncommuning with that Spirit, instead of seeking human intercourse or\r\nearthly counsel. He did not need my affection. He did not need, much\r\nless seek, the approbation of any man. In the events to which this\r\nconversation was a prelude, he acted without explaining himself to me or\r\nto anyone else, and apparently without caring in the slightest what my\r\nopinion or any other man's might be of his course or of the motives that\r\nprompted it.\r\n\r\nSome months later, in the office of the Presidency (at a business\r\nmeeting with him, Colonel Clayton and Joseph F. Smith), I excused myself\r\nfrom attending any further sittings of the committee for that day,\r\nbecause I had to go to Provo to receive the Republican nomination for\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nMy father said: \"I am sorry to hear it. I thought Judge Zane--or someone\r\nelse would be nominated. I wished you to be free to help with these\r\nbusiness matters. Why have you not consulted us?\"\r\n\r\nI reminded him that I had told him, some weeks before, that I expected\r\nto be nominated for Congress this year--and that I was practically\r\ncertain, if elected, of going to the Senate when we were granted\r\nstatehood. \"I talked with you, then, as my father,\" I said. \"But I'm\r\nsure you'll remember that I have not consulted you as a leader of the\r\nChurch, or any of your colleagues as leaders of the Church, on the\r\nsubject of partisan politics since the People's Party was dissolved.\"\r\n\r\nHe accepted this mild declaration of political independence without\r\nprotest, and I went to Provo, happily, a free man. The Republicans\r\nnominated me by acclamation, and the chairman of the committee that came\r\nto offer me the nomination was Colonel Wm. Nelson, then managing editor\r\nof the Salt Lake Tribune, a Gentile, a former leader of the Liberal\r\nParty, an opponent of Mormonism as practiced, who had fought the Church\r\nhierarchy for years. Here was a new evidence that we were now beyond\r\nthe old quarrels--a further guarantee that we were prepared to take\r\nour place among the states of the Union, free of parochialism and its\r\nsectarian enmities.\r\n\r\nThe campaign gave every proof of such political emancipation. The\r\npeople divided, on national party lines, as completely as any American\r\ncommunity in my experience. The Democrats, having nominated Joseph L.\r\nRawlins, had the prestige that he had gained in helping to pass the\r\nEnabling Act; a Democratic administration was in power in Washington;\r\nApostle Moses Thatcher, Brigham H. Roberts, and other members of the\r\nChurch inspired the old loyalty of the Mormons for the Democracy. But\r\nthe Republicans had been re-enforced by the dissolution of the Liberal\r\nParty, whose last preceding candidate (Mr. Clarence E. Allen) went\r\non the stump for us. The Smith jealousy of Moses Thatcher divided the\r\nChurch influence; and though charges of ecclesiastical interference were\r\nmade on both sides, such interference was personal rather than official.\r\nMr. Rawlins was defeated, and I was elected delegate in Congress from\r\nthe territory--with the United States Senatorship practically assured to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1895 the constitutional convention at Salt Lake City\r\nformulated a provisional constitution for the new Utah; and, in the Fall\r\nof the year, a general election was held to adopt this constitution and\r\nto elect officers who should enter upon their duties as soon as Utah\r\nbecame a state. The election was marked by a most significant and\r\nimportant incident.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, in their convention, nominated for Congress, Brigham H.\r\nRoberts, one of the first seven \"presidents of the seventy,\" and for\r\nthe United States Senate, Joseph L. Rawlins and Apostle Moses Thatcher.\r\nImmediately, at a priesthood meeting of the hierarchy, Joseph F. Smith\r\ndenounced the candidacies of Roberts and Thatcher; and the grounds for\r\nthe denunciation were subsequently stated in the \"political manifesto\"\r\nof April, 1896, in which the First Presidency announced, as a rule of\r\nthe Church, that no official of the Church should accept a political\r\nnomination until he had obtained the permission of the Church\r\nauthorities and had learned from them whether he could \"consistently\r\nwith the obligations already entered into with the Church, take upon\r\nhimself the added duties and labors and responsibilities of the new\r\nposition.\"\r\n\r\nThis action, I knew, was the result of the old jealousy of Thatcher\r\nwhich the Smiths had so long nursed. But it was also in line with\r\nthe Church's pledge, to keep its leaders out of politics. By it,\r\nthe hierarchy bound themselves and set the people free. The leaders,\r\nthereafter, according to their own \"manifesto,\" could not enter politics\r\nwithout the consent of their quorums; and, therefore, by any American\r\ndoctrine, they could not enter politics at all. Thatcher and Roberts\r\nrevolted against the inhibition as an infringement of their rights as\r\ncitizens, and it was so construed by the whole Democratic party; but\r\neveryone knew that a Mormon apostle had no rights as a citizen that were\r\nnot second to his Church allegiance, and the political manifesto\r\nsimply made public the fact of such subservience, authoritatively. We\r\nRepublicans welcomed it, with our eyes on the future freedom of politics\r\nin Utah; Thatcher and Roberts refused to accept the dictation of their\r\nquorums, and what was practically an \"edict of apostasy\" went out\r\nagainst them. They were defeated. The Republican candidates (Heber M.\r\nWells, as governor, and Clarence B. Allen, as member of Congress)\r\nwere elected. Thatcher, subsequently refusing to accept the \"political\r\nmanifesto,\" was deposed from his apostolic authority, and deprived of\r\nall priesthood in the Church. Roberts recanted and was reconciled with\r\nthe hierarchy.\r\n\r\n[FOOTNOTE: He was afterwards elected to the House of Representatives and\r\nwas refused his seat as a polygamist.]\r\n\r\nThe Republicans elected forty-three out of sixty-three members of the\r\nlegislature, and everyone of these had been pledged to support me, for\r\nthe United States Senate, either by his convention, or by letter to me,\r\nor by a promise conveyed to me by friends; and none of these pledges had\r\nI solicited.\r\n\r\nThe rumors of my father's candidacy now became more general--although\r\nhe was a Democrat, although the new \"political manifesto\" bound him,\r\nalthough it was doubtful whether the Senate would allow him to be\r\nseated. Two influences were urging his election. One was the desire\r\nof the Smith faction to have the First Councillor break the ice at\r\nWashington for Apostle John Henry Smith, who was ambitious to be a\r\nSenator and was disqualified by the fact that he was a Church leader and\r\na polygamist. The other was the desire of some Eastern capitalists to\r\nhave my father's vote in the Senate to aid them in the promotion of a\r\nrailroad from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. A preliminary agreement\r\nfor the construction of the road had already been signed by men who\r\nrepresented that they had close affiliations with large steel interests\r\nin the East, as one party, and my father as business representative of\r\na group of associates, including the Presidency of the Church. The\r\nChurch's interest in the project was communistic, and so was my\r\nfather's. But his vote and influence in the Senate would be valuable to\r\nthe promotion of the undertaking, and he had received written assurances\r\nfrom Republican leaders, senators and politicians, that if he were\r\nelected he would be allowed his seat.\r\n\r\nAs a result of our Republican success in the two political campaigns\r\nthat had just ended, I felt that I represented the independent votes\r\nof both Mormons and Gentiles; and I decided to confront the First\r\nPresidency (as such a representative) and try to make them declare\r\nthemselves in the matter of my father's candidacy. Not that I thought\r\nhis candidacy would be so vitally important for I did not then believe\r\nthe Church authorities had power to sway the legislature away from its\r\npledges. But every day, at home or abroad, I was being asked: \"Are you\r\nsure that the Church's retirement from politics is sincere?\" My friends\r\nwere accepting my word, and I wished to add certainty to assurance that\r\nthe Church leaders intended to fulfill the covenant of their personal\r\nhonor and respect the constitution of the state by keeping out of\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nWithout letting them know why I wished to see them, I procured an\r\nappointment for the interview. When we were all seated at the table I\r\nexplained: \"I'm going to Washington to attend to my duties as delegate\r\nin Congress. Before I return, Utah will be admitted to statehood, and\r\nthe legislature will have to elect two United States Senators. As you\r\nall know, I've been a candidate for one of these places. It has been\r\nassured to me by the probably unanimous vote of the Republican caucus\r\nwhen it shall convene.\" I laid my clenched hand on the table, knuckles\r\ndown, with a calculated abruptness. \"The first senatorship from Utah is\r\nthere,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"If it's to be disturbed by any ecclesiastical direction, I want to know\r\nit now, so that the men who are supporting me may be aware of what\r\nthey must encounter if they persist in their support. I ask you, as\r\nthe Presidency of the Church: what are you going to do about the\r\nSenatorship?\" And I opened my hand and left it lying open before them,\r\nfor their decision.\r\n\r\nIt was evident enough, from their expressions, that this was a degree of\r\nboldness to which they were unaccustomed. It was, evident also that\r\nthey were unprepared to reply to me. My father remained silent, with his\r\nusual placidity, waiting for the others to fail to take the initiative.\r\nPresident Woodruff blinked, somewhat bewildered, looking at my hand\r\nas if the sight of its emptiness and the assumption of what it held,\r\nconfused him. Joseph F. Smith, frowning, eyed it askance with a darting\r\nglance, apparently annoyed by the mute insolence of its demand for a\r\ndecision which he was not prepared to make.\r\n\r\nMy father, at length, looking at me imperturbably, asked: \"Are you\r\ninquiring of our personal view in this matter, Frank?\"\r\n\r\nThe question contained, of course, a tacit allusion to my refusal to\r\nconsult the Church leaders about politics. I answered: \"No, sir. I\r\nalready have your personal view. That is the only personal view I have\r\never asked concerning the Senatorship. And I have purposely refrained\r\nfrom any allusions to it of late, with you, because I wished to lay it\r\nbefore the Presidency, as a body, formally, in order that there might be\r\nno possible misunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" he said, \"the matter rests with President Woodruff.\"\r\n\r\nThe President, thus forced to an explanation, made a very characteristic\r\none. Several of the Church's friends in the East, he said, had urged\r\nfather's name for the Senatorship, but it was impossible to see how he\r\ncould be spared from the affairs of the priesthood. Zion needed him--and\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\nApparently, to President Woodruff, the question of the Senatorship was\r\nresolvable wholly upon Church considerations. His mind was so filled\r\nwith zealous hope for the advancement of \"the Kingdom of God on Earth,\"\r\nthat he seemed quite unaware of the political aspects of the case, the\r\nviolation of the Church's pledge, and the difficulties in the Senate\r\nthat would surely attend upon my father's election.\r\n\r\nIn the general discussion that ensued, both Joseph F. Smith and my\r\nfather spoke of the appeal that had been made to them on behalf of the\r\nbusiness interests of the community, with which the financial interests\r\nof the East were now eager to co-operate. But both followed the\r\nPresident's example in dismissing the possibility of the First\r\nCouncillor's candidacy as infringing upon his duties in the Church. I\r\npointed out to them that such a candidacy would be considered a breach\r\nof faith, that it would raise a storm of protest. They accepted the\r\nwarning without comment, as if, having decided against the candidacy,\r\nthey did not need to consider such aspects of it. I kept my hand open\r\nbefore them until my father said, with some trace of amusement: \"You'd\r\nbetter take up that senatorship, Frank. I think you're entitled to it.\"\r\n\r\nI took it up, satisfied that there would be no more Church interference\r\nin the matter. The decision seemed to me final and momentous. I\r\nfelt that the new Utah had faced the old and had been assured of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nAbout this same time (although I cannot place it accurately in my\r\nrecollection), President Woodruff, speaking from the pulpit, declared\r\nthat it was the right of the priesthood of God to rule in all things on\r\nearth, and that they had in no wise relinquished any of their authority.\r\nThe sermon raised a dangerous alarm in Salt Lake City, and I\r\nwas immediately summoned from Ogden (by a messenger from Church\r\nheadquarters) to see the proprietor and the editor of the Salt Lake\r\nTribune--which paper, it was feared, might oppose Utah's admission to\r\nstatehood, construing President Woodruff's remarks to mean that the\r\nChurch's political covenants were to be broken.\r\n\r\nI found Mr. P. H. Lannan, the proprietor of the paper, anxious,\r\nindignant and ready to denounce the Church and fight against the\r\nadmission to statehood. \"When I heard of that sermon,\" he said, \"my\r\nheart went into my boots. We Gentiles have trusted everything to the\r\npromises that have been made by the leaders of the Church. If the\r\nTribune had not supported the movement for statehood, the Gentiles would\r\nnever have taken the risk. I feel like a man who has sold his brethren\r\ninto slavery.\"\r\n\r\nI assured him (as I was authorized to do) that President Woodruff\r\nwas not speaking for our generation of the Mormon people nor for his\r\nassociates in the leadership of the Church. I pleaded that it was the\r\nprivilege of an old man (and President Woodruff was nearly ninety) to\r\ndream again the visions of his youth; his early life had been spent in\r\nthe belief that a Kingdom of God was to be set up in the valleys of\r\nthe mountains, governed by the priesthood and destined to rule all the\r\nnations of the earth; he had planted the first flag of the country over\r\nthe Salt Lake Valley; he was still living in days that had passed for\r\nall but him, and cherishing hopes that he alone had not abandoned. But\r\nif the Tribune and the Gentiles would be magnanimous in this matter,\r\nthey would add to the gratitude that already bound the younger\r\ngenerations of the Church to the fulfillment of its political promises.\r\n\r\nMr. Lannan responded instantly to the appeal to his generosity, and\r\nafter consultation with the editor-in-chief (Judge C. C. Goodwin) and\r\nthe managing editor (Colonel Wm. Nelson) the Tribune continued to trust\r\nin Mormon good faith.\r\n\r\nI reported the result of my conference to Church headquarters. The news\r\nwas received with relief and gratitude. And, in a long conversation\r\nwith the authorities, I was told that it would be incumbent on us of the\r\nyounger generation to see that all the Church's covenants to the nation\r\nshould be scrupulously observed.\r\n\r\nI accepted my part of the charge with a light heart, and late in\r\nNovember, 1895, I took train for Washington for convening of Congress.\r\nOf the incidents of my brief services as delegate I shall write nothing\r\nhere, since those incidents were merely introductory to matters which\r\nI shall have to consider later. But I was greeted with a great deal\r\nof cordiality by the Republicans who credited me with having brought\r\na state and its national representation into the Republican party, and\r\nthey assured me that my own political future would be as bright as that\r\nof my native state!\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland, on January 4, 1896, proclaimed Utah a sovereign\r\nstate of the Union, and its admission to statehood ended, of course, my\r\nservice as a territorial delegate. I stood beside his desk in the White\r\nHouse to see him sign the proclamation--the same desk at which he had\r\nreceived me, some eight years before, when I came beseeching him to be\r\nmerciful to the proscribed people whose freedom he was now announcing.\r\nPerhaps the manumission that he was granting, gave a benignity to his\r\nface. Perhaps the emotion in my own mind transfigured him to me. But\r\nI saw smiles and pathos in the ruggedness of his expression of\r\ncongratulation as he said a few words of hope that Utah would fulfill\r\nevery promise made, on her behalf, by her own people, and every happy\r\nexpectation that had been entertained for her by her friends. His\r\nenormous rigid bulk, a little bowed now by years of service, seemed\r\nsoftened, as his face was, to the graciousness of clement power. He gave\r\nme the pen with which he had signed the paper, and dismissed me to some\r\nof the happiest hours of my life.\r\n\r\nI walked out of the White House dispossessed of office, but now, at\r\nlast, a citizen of the Republic. I stood on the steps of the White\r\nHouse, to look at the city through whose streets I had so many times\r\nwandered in a worried despair, and I saw them with an emotion I would\r\nnot dare transcribe. I do not know that the sun was really shining, but\r\nin my memory the scene has taken on all the accumulated brightnesses of\r\nall the radiant days I ever knew in Washington. And I remember that\r\nI saw the Washington Monument and the Capitol with a sense of almost\r\naffectionate personal possession!\r\n\r\nIn an excited exultation I went to thank the men who had helped us\r\nin the House and the Senate--to wire jubilant messages home--to\r\nsend Governor Wells the pen with which the President had signed his\r\nproclamation, and to procure from friends in the War Department the\r\nfirst two flags that had been made with forty-five stars--the star of\r\nUtah the forty-fifth. Wherever I went, some sinister aspect seemed to\r\nhave gone out of things; and I remember that I enjoyed so much the sense\r\nof their new inhostility, that I planned to delay my return to Utah\r\nuntil I had made a pilgrimage to every spot in Washington where I had\r\ndespaired of our future.\r\n\r\nAll this may seem almost sentimental to you, who perhaps accept your\r\ncitizenship as an unregarded commonplace of natural right. But, for me,\r\nthe freeing of our people was an emancipation to be compared only to the\r\nenfranchisement of the Southern slaves and greater even than that,\r\nfor we had come from citizenship in the older states, and we could\r\nappreciate our deprivation, smart under our ostracism, and resent the\r\nrejection that set us apart from the rest of the nation as an inferior\r\npeople unfit for equal rights.\r\n\r\nI sat down to my dinner, that evening, with the appetite that comes\r\nfrom a day of fasting and emotional excitement; and I recall that I was\r\nplanning a visit of self-congratulation to Arlington, for the morrow,\r\nwhen one of the hotel bell-boys brought me a telegram. I opened it\r\neagerly--to enjoy the expected message of felicitation from home.\r\n\r\nIt was in cipher, and that fact gave me a pause of doubt, since the\r\ndays of political mysteries and their cipher telegrams were over for us,\r\nthank God! It was signed with President Woodruff's cipher name.\r\n\r\nI went to my room to translate it, and I did not return to my dinner.\r\nThe message read: \"It is the will of the Lord that your father shall be\r\nelected Senator from Utah.\"\r\n\r\nI do not need to explain all the treacherous implications of that\r\nannouncement. As soon as I had recovered my breath, I wired back, for\r\nsuch interpretation as they should choose to give: \"God bless Utah. I am\r\ncoming home,\"--and packed my trunk, for trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. The First Betrayals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I reached Utah, my friends, Ben Rich and James Devine, met me, on\r\nthe train. The news of President Woodruff's \"revelation\" had percolated\r\nthrough the whole community. The Gentiles were alarmed for themselves.\r\nMy friends were anxious for me. All the old enmities that had so long\r\ndivided Utah were arranging themselves for a new conflict. And Rich and\r\nDevine had come to urge me to remember my promise that I would hold to\r\nmy candidacy no matter who should appear in the field against me.\r\n\r\nOf my father's stand in the crisis Rich could give me only one\r\nindication: after a conference in the offices of the Presidency, Rich\r\nhad said to President Woodruff: \"Then I suppose I may as well close\r\nup Frank's rooms at the Templeton\"--the hotel in which my friends had\r\nopened political headquarters for me--and my father, accompanying him\r\nto an anteroom, had hinted significantly: \"I think you should not close\r\nFrank's rooms just yet. He may need them.\"\r\n\r\nRich brought me word, too, that the Church authorities were expecting\r\nto see me; and soon as I arrived in Salt Lake City, I hastened to the\r\nlittle plastered house in which the Presidency had its offices.\r\n\r\nPresident Woodruff, my father, and Joseph F. Smith were there, in\r\nthe large room of their official apartments. We withdrew, for private\r\nconference, into the small retiring room in which I had consulted with\r\n\"Brother Joseph Mack\" when he was on the underground--in 1888--and had\r\nconsulted with President Woodruff about his \"manifesto,\" in 1890. The\r\nchange in their circumstances, since those unhappy days, was in my mind\r\nas I sat down.\r\n\r\nPresident Woodruff sat at the head of a bare walnut table in a chair so\r\nlarge that it rather dwarfed him; and he sank down in it, to an attitude\r\nof nervous reluctance to speak, occupied with his hands. Smith took his\r\nplace at the opposite end of the board, with dropped eyes, his chair\r\ntilted back, silent, but (as I soon saw) unusually alert and attentive.\r\nMy father assumed his inevitable composure--firmly and almost unmovingly\r\nseated--and looked at me squarely with a not unkind premonition of a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nPresident Woodruff continued silent. Ordinarily, anything that came\r\nfrom the Lord was quite convincing to him and needed no argument (in his\r\nmind) to make it convincing to others. I could not suppose that the\r\nlook of determination on my face troubled him. It was more likely that\r\nsomething unusual in the mental attitudes of his councillors was the\r\ncause of his hesitation; and with this suspicion to arouse me I\r\nbecame increasingly aware (as the conference proceeded) of two rival\r\nwatchfulnesses upon me.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I said. \"What was it you wanted of me?\"\r\n\r\nSmith looked up at the President. And Smith had always, hitherto, seemed\r\nso unseeing of consequences, and, therefore, unappreciative of means,\r\nthat his betrayal of interest was indicative of purpose. I thought I\r\ncould detect, in the communication which his manner made, the plan of\r\nmy father's ecclesiastical rivals to remove him from the scene of his\r\nsupreme influence over the President, and the plan of ambitious church\r\npoliticians to remove me from their path by the invocation of God's word\r\nappointing father to the Senate.\r\n\r\n\"Frank,\" the President announced, \"it is the will of the Lord that your\r\nfather should go to the Senate from Utah.\"\r\n\r\nAs he hesitated, I said: \"Well, President Woodruff?\"\r\n\r\nHe added, with less decision: \"And we want you to tell us how to bring\r\nit about?\"\r\n\r\nIt was evident that getting the revelation was easy to his spiritualized\r\nmind, but that fulfilling it was difficult to his unworldliness.\r\n\r\n\"President Woodruff,\" I replied, \"you have received the revelation on\r\nthe wrong point. You do not need a voice from heaven to convince anyone\r\nthat my father is worthy to go to the Senate, but you will need a\r\nrevelation to tell how he is to get there.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to raise himself to the inspiration of divine authority. \"The\r\nonly difficulty that we have encountered,\" he said, \"is the fact that\r\nthe legislators are pledged to you. Will you not release them from their\r\npromises and tell them to vote for your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"And my father would not permit me to do it, even if I\r\ncould. He knows that I gave my word of honor to my supporters to stand\r\nas a candidate, no matter who might enter against me. He knows that he\r\nand I have given our pledges at Washington that political dictation in\r\nUtah by the heads of the Mormon Church shall cease. Of all men in Utah\r\nwe cannot be amenable to such dictation. If you can get my supporters\r\naway from me--very well. I shall have no personal regrets. But you\r\ncannot get me away from my supporters.\"\r\n\r\nThis inclusion of my father in my refusal evidently disconcerted\r\nPresident Woodruff; and, as evidently, it had its significance to Joseph\r\nF. Smith.\r\n\r\nI went on: \"Before I was elected to the House of Representatives, I\r\nasked my father if he intended to be a candidate for the Senate. I\r\nknew that some prominent Gentiles, desiring to curry favor at Church\r\nheadquarters had solicited his candidacy. I had been told that General\r\nClarkson and others had assured him by letter that his election would be\r\naccepted at Washington, and elsewhere. I discussed the matter with him\r\nfully. He agreed with me that his election would be a violation of the\r\nunderstanding had with the country; and he declared that he did not care\r\nto become again the storm center of strife to his people, nor did he\r\nfeel that he could honorably break our covenant to the country. With\r\nthis clear understanding between us, I made my pledges to men who, in\r\nsupporting me, cast aside equally advantageous relations which they\r\nmight have established with another. I can't withdraw now without\r\ndishonor.\"\r\n\r\nMy father said: \"Don't let us have any misunderstandings. As President\r\nWoodruff stated the matter to me, I understood that it would be pleasing\r\nto the Lord, if the people desired my election to the Senate and it\r\nwouldn't antagonize the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" the President put in. \"That's what I mean.\"\r\n\r\nSmith said, rather sourly: \"The people are always willing to do what the\r\nLord desires--if no one gives them bad counsel.\"\r\n\r\nBoth he and my father emphasized the fact that the business interests of\r\nthe East were making strong representations to the Presidency in support\r\nof my father's election; and I suspected (what I afterwards found to be\r\nthe case) that both Joseph F. Smith and Apostle John Henry Smith, were\r\nby this time, in close communication with Republican politicians. There\r\nwas a calm assumption, everywhere, that the Church had power to decide\r\nthe election, if it could be induced to act; and this assumption was\r\na deplorable evidence, to me, of the willingness of some of our former\r\nallies to drag us swiftly to the shame of a broken covenant, if only\r\nthey could profit in purse or politics by our dishonor. I would not be\r\nan agent in any such betrayal, but I had to refuse without offending\r\nmy father's trust in the divine inspiration of President Woodruff's\r\ndecision and without aiding the Smiths in their conspiracy.\r\n\r\nEither at this conference or one of the later ones, two or three\r\napostles came into the room; and among them was Apostle Brigham Young,\r\nson of the Prophet Brigham who had led the Mormons to the Salt Lake\r\nValley. When he understood my refusal to abandon my candidacy, he said\r\nangrily: \"This is a serious filial disrespect. I know my father never\r\nwould have brooked such treatment from me.\" And I retorted: \"I don't\r\nknow who invited you into this conference, but I deny your right to\r\ninstruct me in my filial duty. If my father doesn't understand that the\r\nsenatorship has lost its value for me--that it's a cross now--then my\r\nwhole lifetime of devotion to him has been in vain.\"\r\n\r\nMy father rose and put his arm around my shoulders. \"This boy,\" he\r\nsaid, \"is acting honorably. I want him to know--and you to know--that\r\nI respect the position he has taken. If he is elected, he shall have my\r\nblessing.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the only understanding I had with him--but it was enough. I\r\ncould know that I was not to lose his trust and affection by holding to\r\nour obligations of honor; and--an assurance almost as precious--I could\r\nknow that he would not consciously permit legislators to be crushed by\r\nthe vengeance of the Church if they refused to yield to its pressure.\r\n\r\nA few days after my arrival in Utah, and while this controversy was at\r\nits height, my father's birthday was celebrated (January 11, 1896),\r\nwith all the patriarchal pomp of a Mormon family gathering, in his big\r\ncountry house outside Salt Lake City. All his descendants and collateral\r\nrelatives were there, as well as the members of the Presidency and many\r\nfriends. After dinner, the usual exercises of the occasion were held in\r\nthe large reception hall of the house, with President Woodruff and my\r\nfather and two or three other Church leaders seated in semi-state at one\r\nend of the hall, and the others of the company deferentially withdrawn\r\nto face them. Towards the end of the program President Woodruff\r\nrose from his easy chair, and made a sort of informal address of\r\ncongratulation; and in the course of it, with his hand on my father's\r\nshoulder, he said benignly: \"Abraham was the friend of God. He had\r\nonly one son on whom all his hopes were set. But the voice of the Lord\r\ncommanded him to sacrifice Isaac upon an altar; and Abraham trusted the\r\nLord and laid his son upon the altar, in obedience to God's commands.\r\nNow here is another servant of the Most High and a friend of God. I\r\nrefer to President Cannon, whose birthday we are celebrating. He has\r\ntwenty-one sons; and if it shall be the will of the Lord that he must\r\nsacrifice one of them he ought to be as willing as Abraham was, for he\r\nwill have twenty left. And the son should be as willing as Isaac. We can\r\nall safely trust in the Lord. He will require no sacrifice at our hands\r\nwithout purpose.\"\r\n\r\nI remarked to a relative beside me that the altar was evidently ready\r\nfor me, but that I feared I should have to \"get out and rustle my own\r\nram in the thicket.\" I received no reply. I heard no word of comment\r\nfrom anyone upon the President's speech. It was accepted devoutly,\r\nwith no feeling that he had abused the privileges of a guest. Everyone\r\nunderstood (as I did) that President Woodruff was the gentlest of men;\r\nthat he had often professed and always shown a kindly affection for me;\r\nbut that the will of the Lord being now known, he thought I should be\r\nproud to be sacrificed to it!\r\n\r\nAmong the legislators pledged to me were Mormon Bishops and other\r\necclesiasts who had promised their constituents to vote for me and who\r\nnow stood between a betrayal of their people and a rebellion against the\r\npower of the hierarchy. I released one of them from his pledge, because\r\nof his pathetic fear that he would be eternally damned if he did not\r\nobey \"the will of the Lord.\" The others went to the Presidency to admit\r\nthat if they betrayed their people they would have to confess what\r\npressure had been put upon them to force them to the betrayal. I went to\r\nnotify my father (as I had notified the representatives of every\r\nother candidate) that we were going to call a caucus of the Republican\r\nmajority of the legislature, and later I was advised that President\r\nWoodruff and his Councillor's had appointed a committee to investigate\r\nand report to them how many members could be counted upon to support\r\nmy father's candidacy. The committee (composed of my uncle Angus, my\r\nbrother Abraham, and Apostle John Henry Smith) brought back word that\r\neven among the men who had professed a willingness to vote for my father\r\nthere was great reluctance and apprehension, and that in all probability\r\nhis election could not be carried. With President Woodruff's consent,\r\nmy father then announced that he was not a candidate. I was nominated by\r\nacclamation.\r\n\r\nWhen I called upon my father at the President's offices after the\r\nelection, he said to me before his colleagues: \"I wish to congratulate\r\nyou on having acted honorably and fearlessly. You have my blessing.\" He\r\nturned to the President. \"You see, President Woodruff,\" he added, \"it\r\nwas not the will of the Lord, after all, since the people did not desire\r\nmy election!\"\r\n\r\nI have dwelt so largely upon the religious aspects of this affair\r\nbecause they are as true of the Prophet in politics today as they were\r\nthen. At the time, the personal complication of the situation most\r\ndistressed me--the fact that I was opposing my father in order to\r\nfulfill the word of honor that we had given on behalf of the Mormon\r\nleaders. But there was another view of the matter; and it is the one\r\nthat is most important to the purposes of this narrative. In the course\r\nof the various discussions and conferences upon the Senatorship, I\r\nlearned that the inspiration of the whole attempted betrayal had come\r\nfrom certain Republican politicians and lobbyists (like Colonel Isaac\r\nTrumbo), who claimed to represent a political combination of business\r\ninterests in Washington. Joseph F. Smith admitted as much to me in more\r\nthan one conversation. (I had offended these interests by opposing a\r\nmonetary and a tariff bill during my service as delegate in Congress--a\r\nmatter which I have still to recount). They had chosen my father and\r\nColonel Trumbo as Utah's two Senators. I made it my particular business\r\nto see that Trumbo's name was not even mentioned in the caucus. The\r\nman selected as the other senator was Arthur Brown, a prominent Gentile\r\nlawyer who was known as a \"jack-Mormon\" (meaning a Gentile adherent to\r\nChurch power), although I then believed, and do now, that Judge Chas.\r\nC. Goodwin was the Gentile most entitled to the place, because of his\r\nability and the love of his people.\r\n\r\nI was, however, content with the victory we had won by resisting the\r\ninfluence of the business interests that had been willing to sell\r\nour honor for their profit, and I set out for Washington with a\r\ndetermination to continue the resistance. I was in a good position to\r\ncontinue it. The election of two Republican Senators from Utah had given\r\nthe Republicans a scant majority of the members of the Upper House,\r\nand the bills that I had fought in the Lower House were now before the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThese bills had been introduced in the House of Representatives,\r\nimmediately upon its convening in December, 1895, by the committee on\r\nrules, before Speaker Reed had even appointed the general committees.\r\nOne was a bill to authorize the issuance of interest-bearing securities\r\nof the United States at such times and in such sums as the Executive\r\nmight determine. The other was a general tariff bill that proposed\r\nincreases upon the then existing Wilson-Gorman bill. The first would\r\nput into the hands of the President a power that was not enjoyed by\r\nany ruler in Christendom; the second would add to the unfair and\r\ndiscriminatory tariff rates then in force, by making ad valorem\r\nincreases in them. Many new members of Congress had been elected on\r\nthe two issues thus created: the arbitrary increase of the bonded\r\nindebtedness by President Cleveland to maintain a gold reserve; and the\r\nunjust benefits afforded those industries that were least in need of\r\naid, by duties increased in exact proportion to the strength of the\r\nindustrial combination that was to be protected.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of the two bills by the Committee on Rules--with\r\na coacher to each proposing to prevent amendment and limit\r\ndiscussion--raised a revolt in the House. A caucus of the insurgent\r\nRepublican members was held at the Ebbitt Hotel, and I was elected\r\ntemporary chairman. We appointed a committee to demand from Speaker Reed\r\na division of the questions and time for opposition to be heard. We had\r\nseventy-five insurgents when our committee waited on. Reed; and most\r\nof us were new men, elected to oppose such measures as these bills\r\nadvocated. He received us with sarcasm, put us off with a promise to\r\nconsider our demands, and then set his lieutenants at work among\r\nus. Under the threat of the Speaker's displeasure if we continued to\r\n\"insurge\" and the promise of his favor if we \"got into line,\" forty-one\r\n(I think) of our seventy-five deserted us. We were gloriously beaten in\r\nthe House on both measures.\r\n\r\nSome of the older Republican members of the House came to ask me how\r\nI had been \"misled\"; and they received with the raised eyebrow and\r\nthe silent shrug my explanation that I had been merely following my\r\nconvictions and living up to the promises I had made my constituents.\r\nI had supposed that I was upholding an orthodox Republican doctrine\r\nin helping to defend the country from exploitation by the financial\r\ninterests, in the matter of the bond issue, and from the greed of the\r\nbusiness interests in the attempt to increase horizontally the tariff\r\nrates.\r\n\r\nI do not need, in this day of tariff reform agitation, to argue the\r\ninjustice of the latter measure. But the bond issue--looking back upon\r\nit now--seems the more cruelly absurd of the two. Here we were, in times\r\nof peace, with ample funds in the national treasury, proposing to permit\r\nthe unlimited issuance of interest-bearing government bonds in order\r\nto procure gold, for that national treasury, out of the hoards of the\r\nbanks, so that these same banks might be able to obtain the gold again\r\nfrom the treasury in return for paper money. The extent to which this\r\nsort of absurdity might be carried would depend solely upon the desire\r\nof the confederation of finance to have interest-bearing government\r\nbonds on which they might issue national bank notes, since the Executive\r\nwas apparently willing to yield interminably to their greed, in the\r\nbelief that he was protecting the public credit by encouraging the\r\nfinanciers to attack that credit with their raids on the government\r\ngold reserve. The whole difficulty had arisen, of course, out of the\r\nagitation upon the money question. The banks were drawing upon the\r\ngovernment gold reserve; and the government was issuing bonds to recover\r\nthe gold again from the banks.\r\n\r\nI had been, for some years, interested in the problem of our monetary\r\nsystem and had studied and discussed it among our Eastern bankers and\r\nabroad. The very fact that I was from a \"silver state\" had put me on my\r\nguard, lest a local influence should lead me, into economic error. I had\r\ngrown into the belief that our system was wrong. It seemed to me that\r\nsome remedy was imperative. I saw in bimetallism a part of the remedy,\r\nand I supported bimetallism not as a partisan of free coinage but as an\r\nadvocate of monetary reform.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Utah's two representatives in the Senate (January 27,\r\n1896) gave the bimetallists a majority, and when the bond-issue bill\r\ncame before us we made it into a bill to permit the free coinage of\r\nsilver. (February 1). A few days later, the Finance Committee turned\r\nthe tariff bill into a free-coinage bill also. On both measures, five\r\nRepublican Senators voted against their party--Henry M. Teller, of\r\nColorado; Fred T. Dubois, of Idaho; Thos. H. Carter, of Montana; Lee\r\nMantle, of Montana; and myself. We were subsequently joined by Richard\r\nF. Pettigrew of South Dakota. Within two weeks of my taking the oath\r\nin the Senate we were read out of the party by Republican leaders and\r\nRepublican organs.\r\n\r\nAll this happened so swiftly that there was no time for any\r\nremonstrances to come to me from Salt Lake City, even if the Church\r\nauthorities had wished to remonstrate. The fact was that the people of\r\nUtah were with us in our insurgency, and when the financial interests\r\nsubsequently appealed to the hierarchy, they found the Church powerless\r\nto aid them in support of a gold platform. But they obtained that aid,\r\nat last, in support of a tariff that was as unjust to the people as it\r\nwas favorable to the trusts, and my continued \"insurgency\" led me again\r\ninto a revolt against Church interference.\r\n\r\nThe thread of connection that ran through these incidents is clear\r\nenough to me now: they were all incidents in the progress of a\r\npartnership between the Church and the predatory business interests that\r\nhave since so successfully exploited the country. But, at the time,\r\nI saw no such connection clearly. I supposed that the partnership was\r\nmerely a political friendship between the Smith faction in the Church\r\nand the Republican politicians who wished to use the Church; and I had\r\nsufficient contempt for the political abilities of the Smiths to regard\r\ntheir conspiracy rather lightly.\r\n\r\nBelieving still in the good faith of the Mormon people and their real\r\nleaders in authority, I introduced a joint resolution in the Senate\r\nrestoring to the Church its escheated real estate, which was still in\r\nthe hands of a receiver, although its personal property had been\r\nalready restored. In conference with Senators Hoar and Allison,--of the\r\ncommittee to which the resolution was referred--I urged an unconditional\r\nrestoration of the property, arguing that to place conditions upon the\r\nrestoration would be to insult the people who had given so many proofs\r\nof their willingness to obey the law and keep their pledges. The\r\nproperty was restored without conditions by a joint resolution that\r\npassed the Senate on March 18, 1896, passed the House a week later, and\r\nwas approved by the President on March 26. The Church was now free of\r\nthe last measure of proscription. Its people were in the enjoyment of\r\nevery political liberty of American citizenship; and I joined in the\r\nPresidential campaign of 1896 with no thought of any danger threatening\r\nus that was not common to the other communities of the country.\r\n\r\nBut before I continue further with these political events, I must relate\r\na private incident in the secret betrayal of Utah--an incident that must\r\nbe related, if this narrative is to remain true to the ideals of public\r\nduty that have thus far assumed to inspire it--an incident of which a\r\nfalse account was given before a Senate Committee in Washington\r\nduring the Smoot investigation of 1904, accompanied by a denial of\r\nresponsibility by Joseph F. Smith, the man whose authority alone\r\nencouraged and accomplished the tragedy--for it was a tragedy, as\r\ndark in its import to the Mormon community as it was terrible in its\r\nimmediate consequences to all our family.\r\n\r\nBy his denial of responsibility and by secret whisper within the Church,\r\nSmith has placed the disgrace of the betrayal upon my father, who\r\nwas guiltless of it, and blackened the memory of my dead brother by a\r\nmisrepresentation of his motives. I feel that it is incumbent upon me,\r\ntherefore, at whatever pain to myself, to relate the whole unhappy truth\r\nof the affair, as much to defend the memory of the dead as to denounce\r\nthe betrayal of the living, to expose a public treason against the\r\ncommunity not less than to correct a private wrong done to the good name\r\nof those whom it is my right to defend.\r\n\r\nLate in July, 1896, when I was in New York on business for the\r\nPresidency, I received a telegram announcing the death of my brother,\r\nApostle Abraham H. Cannon. We had been companions all our lives; he had\r\nbeen the nearest to me of our family, the dearest of my friends but even\r\nin the first shock of my grief I realized that my father would have a\r\ngreater stroke of sorrow to bear than I; and in hurrying back to Salt\r\nLake City I nerved myself with the hope that I might console him.\r\n\r\nI found him and Joseph F. Smith in the office of the Presidency,\r\nsitting at their desks. My father turned as I entered, and his face was\r\nunusually pale in spite of its composure; but the moment he recognized\r\nme, his expression changed to a look of pain that alarmed me. He rose\r\nand put his hand on my shoulder with a tenderness that it was his habit\r\nto conceal. \"I know how you feel his loss,\" he said hoarsely, \"but when\r\nI think what he would have had to pass through if he had lived I cannot\r\nregret his death.\"\r\n\r\nThe almost agonized expression of his face, as much as the terrible\r\nimplication of his words, startled me with I cannot say what horrible\r\nfear about my brother. I asked, \"Why! Why--what has happened?\"\r\n\r\nWith a sweep of his hand toward Smith at his desk--a gesture and a\r\nlook the most unkind I ever saw him use--he answered: \"A few weeks ago,\r\nAbraham took a plural wife, Lillian Hamlin. It became known. He would\r\nhave had to face a prosecution in Court. His death has saved us from\r\na calamity that would have been dreadful for the Church--and for the\r\nstate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father!\" I cried. \"Has this thing come back again! And the ink hardly\r\ndry on the bill that restored your church property on the pledge of\r\nhonor that there would never be another case--\" I had caught the look on\r\nSmith's face, and it was a look of sullen defiance. \"How did it happen?\"\r\n\r\nMy father replied: \"I know--it's awful. I would have prevented it if\r\nI could. I was asked for my consent, and I refused it. President Smith\r\nobtained the acquiescence of President Woodruff, on the plea that it\r\nwasn't an ordinary case of polygamy but merely a fulfillment of the\r\nbiblical instruction that a man should take his dead brother's wife.\r\nLillian was betrothed to David, and had been sealed to him in eternity\r\nafter his death. I understand that President Woodruff told Abraham\r\nhe would leave the matter with them if he wished to take the\r\nresponsibility--and President Smith performed the ceremony.\"\r\n\r\nSmith could hear every word that was said. My father had included him\r\nin the conversation, and he was listening. He not only did not deny\r\nhis guilt; he accepted it in silence, with an expression of sulky\r\ndisrespect.\r\n\r\nHe did not deny it later, when the whole community had learned of it. He\r\nwent with Apostle John Henry Smith to see Mr. P. H. Lannan, proprietor\r\nof the Salt Lake Tribune, to ask him not to attack the Church for\r\nthis new and shocking violation of its covenant. Mr. Lannan had been\r\nintimately friendly with my brother, and he was distressed between his\r\nregard for his dead friend and his obligation to do his public duty.\r\nI do not know all that the Smiths said to him; but I know that the\r\nconversation assumed that Joseph F. Smith had performed the marriage\r\nceremony; I know that neither of the Smiths made any attempt to deny the\r\nassumption; and I know that Joseph F. Smith sought to placate Mr. Lannan\r\nby promising \"it shall not occur again.\" And this interview was sought\r\nby the Smiths, palpably because wherever the marriage of Abraham H.\r\nCannon and Lillian Hamlin was talked of, Joseph F. Smith was named as\r\nthe priest who had solemnized the offending relation. If it had not been\r\nfor Smith's consciousness of his own guilt and his knowledge that the\r\nwhole community was aware of that guilt, he would never have gone to the\r\nTribune office to make such a promise to Mr. Lannan.\r\n\r\nAll of which did not prevent Joseph F. Smith from testifying--in the\r\nSmoot investigation at Washington in 1904--that he did not marry Abraham\r\nCannon and Lillian Hamlin, that he did not have any conversation with my\r\nfather about the marriage, that he did not know Lillian Hamlin had been\r\nbetrothed to Abraham's dead brother, that the first time he heard of\r\nthe charge that he had married them was when he saw it printed in the\r\nnewspapers!\r\n\r\n[FOOTNOTE: See Proceedings before Senate Committee on Privileges and\r\nElections, 1904, Vol. 1, pages 110, 126, 177, etc.]\r\n\r\nIf this first polygamous marriage had been the last--if it were an\r\nisolated and peculiar incident as the Smiths then claimed it was and\r\npromised it should be--it might be forgiven as generously now as Mr.\r\nLannan then forgave it. But, about the same time there became public\r\nanother case--that of Apostle Teasdale--and as this narrative shall\r\nprove, here was the beginning of a policy of treachery which the\r\npresent Church leaders, under Joseph F. Smith, have since consistently\r\npracticed, in defiance of the laws of the state and the \"revelation\r\nof God,\" with lies and evasions, with perjury and its subornation, in\r\nviolation of the most solemn pledges to the country, and through the\r\nagency of a political tyranny that makes serious prosecution impossible\r\nand immunity a public boast.\r\n\r\nThe world understands that polygamy is an enslavement of women. The\r\necclesiastical authorities in Utah today have discovered that it is\r\nmore powerful as an enslaver of men. Once a man is bound in a polygamous\r\nrelation, there is no place for him in the civilized world outside of\r\na Mormon community. He must remain there, shielded by the Church,\r\nor suffer elsewhere social ostracism and the prosecution of bigamous\r\nrelations. Since 1890, the date of the manifesto (and it is to the\r\nperiod since 1890 that my criticism solely applies) the polygamist must\r\nbe abjectly subservient to the prophets who protect him; he must obey\r\ntheir orders and do their work, or endure the punishment which they can\r\ninflict upon him and his wives and his children. Inveigled into a plural\r\nmarriage by the authority of a clandestine religious dogma--encouraged\r\nby his elders, seduced by the prospect of their favor, and impelled\r\nperhaps by a daring impulse to take the covenant and bond that shall\r\nswear him into the dangerous fellowship of the lawlessly faithful--he\r\nfinds himself, at once, a law breaker who must pay the Church hierarchy\r\nfor his protection by yielding to them every political right, every\r\npersonal independence, every freedom of opinion, every liberty of act.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that Smith fully foresaw the policy which he has since\r\nundoubtedly pursued. I believe now, as I did then, that in betraying my\r\nbrother into polygamy Smith was actuated by his anger against my father\r\nfor having inspired the recession from the doctrine; that he desired\r\nto impair the success of the recession by having my brother dignify\r\nthe recrudescence of polygamy by the apostolic sanction of his\r\nparticipation; and that this participation was jealously designed by\r\nSmith to avenge himself upon the First Councillor by having the son be\r\none of the first to break the law, and violate the covenant. I saw that\r\nmy brother's death had thwarted the conspiracy. Smith was so obviously\r\nfrightened--despite his pretense of defiance--that I believed he had\r\nlearned his needed lesson. And I accepted the incident as a private\r\ntragedy on which the final curtain had now fallen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. The Church and the Interests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I had been taking part in the Presidential campaign of 1896,\r\nand I had been one of the four \"insurgent\" Republican Senators (Teller\r\nof Colorado, Dubois of Idaho, Pettigrew of South Dakota and myself)\r\nwho withdrew from the national Republican convention at St. Louis, in\r\nfulfillment of our obligations to our constituents, when we found\r\nthat the convention was dominated by that confederation of finance in\r\npolitics which has since come to be called \"the System.\" I was a member\r\nof the committee on resolutions, and our actions in the committee had\r\nindicated that we would probably withdraw from the convention if\r\nit adopted the single gold platform as dictated by Senator Lodge of\r\nMassachusetts acting for a group of Republican leaders headed by Platt\r\nof New York, and Aldrich of Rhode Island. At the most critical point of\r\nour controversy I received a message from Church headquarters warning me\r\nthat \"we\" had made powerful friends among the leading men of the nation\r\nand that we ought not to jeopardize their friendship by an inconsiderate\r\ninsurgency. Accordingly, in bolting the convention, I was guilty of\r\na new defiance of ecclesiastical authority and a new provocation of\r\necclesiastical vengeance.\r\n\r\nPresident Woodruff spoke to me of the matter after I returned to Utah,\r\nand I explained to him that I thought the Republican party, under the\r\nleadership of Mark Hanna and the flag of the \"interests,\" had forgotten\r\nits duty to the people of the nation. I argued, to the President, that\r\nof all people in the world we, who had suffered so much ourselves,\r\nwere most bound to bow to no unfairness ourselves and to oppose the\r\nimposition of unfairness upon others. And I talked in this strain to him\r\nnot because I wished his approval of my action but because I wished\r\nto fortify him against the approach of the emissaries of the new\r\nRepublicanism, who were sure to come to him to seek the support of the\r\nChurch in the campaign.\r\n\r\nSome days later, while I was talking with my father in the offices of\r\nthe Presidency, the secretary ushered in Senator Redfield Proctor of\r\nVermont. I withdrew, understanding that he wished to speak in private\r\nwith President Woodruff and his councillors. But I learned subsequently\r\nthat he had come to Salt Lake to persuade the leaders of the Church\r\nto use their power in favor of the Republican party throughout the\r\nintermountain states.\r\n\r\nSenator Proctor asked me personally what chance I thought the party\r\nhad in the West. I pointed out that the Republican platform of 1892\r\nhad reproached Grover Cleveland for his antagonism to bimetallism--\"a\r\ndoctrine favored by the American people from tradition and interest,\"\r\nto quote the language of that platform--and the Republicans of the\r\nintermountain states still held true to the doctrine. It had\r\nbeen repudiated by the St. Louis platform of June, 1896, and the\r\nintermountain states would probably refuse their electoral votes to the\r\nRepublican party because of the repudiation.\r\n\r\nSenator Proctor thought that the leaders of the Church were powerful\r\nenough to control the votes of their followers; and he argued that\r\ngratitude to the Republican party for freeing Utah ought to be stronger\r\nthan the opinions of the people in a merely economic question.\r\n\r\nI reminded him that one of our covenants had been that the Church was\r\nto refrain from dictating to its followers in politics; that we had been\r\nsteadily growing away from the absolutism of earlier times; and that\r\nfor the sake of the peace and progress of Utah I hoped that the leaders\r\nwould keep their hands off. I did not, of course, convince him. Nor was\r\nit necessary. I was sure that no power that the Church would dare to use\r\nwould be sufficient at this time to influence the people against their\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nJoseph F. Smith, soon afterward, notified me that there was to be a\r\nmeeting of the Church authorities in the Temple, and he asked me\r\nto attend it. Since I had never before been invited to one of these\r\nconferences in the \"holy of holies,\" I inquired the purposes of the\r\nconclave. He replied that they desired to consider the situation\r\nin which our people had been placed by my action in the St. Louis\r\nconvention, and to discuss the perceptible trend of public opinion\r\nin the state. I saw, then, that Senator Proctor's visit had not been\r\nwithout avail.\r\n\r\nOn the appointed afternoon, I went to the sacred inner room of the\r\ntemple, where the members of the Presidency and several of the apostles\r\nwere waiting. I shall not describe the room or any of the religious\r\nceremonies with which the conference was opened. I shall confine myself\r\nto the discussion--which was begun mildly by President Woodruff and\r\nLorenzo Snow, then president of the quorum of apostles.\r\n\r\nTo my great surprise, Joseph F. Smith made a violent Republican speech,\r\ndeclaring that I had humiliated the Church and alienated its political\r\nfriends by withdrawing from the St. Louis convention. He was followed by\r\nHeber J. Grant, an apostle, who had always posed as a Democrat; and\r\nhe was as Republican and denunciatory as Smith had been. He declaimed\r\nagainst our alienation of the great business interests of the country,\r\nwhose friendship he and other prominent Mormons had done so much\r\nto cultivate, and from whom we might now procure such advantageous\r\nco-operation if we stood by them in politics.\r\n\r\nPresident Woodruff tried to defend me by saying that he was sure I had\r\nacted conscientiously; but by this time I desired no intervention of\r\nprophetic mercy and no mitigation of judgment that might come of such\r\nintervention. As soon as the President announced that they were prepared\r\nto hear from me, I rose and walked to the farther side of the solemn\r\nchamber, withdrawn from the assembled prophets and confronting\r\nthem. Having first disavowed any recognition of their right as an\r\necclesiastical body to direct me in my political actions, I rehearsed\r\nthe events of the two campaigns in which I had been elected on pledges\r\nthat I had fulfilled by my course in Congress, in the Senate, and\r\nfinally in the St. Louis convention. That course had been approved by\r\nthe people. They had trusted me to carry out the policies on which they\r\nhad elected me to Congress. They had reiterated the trust by electing\r\nme to the Senate after I had revolted against the Republican bond and\r\ntariff measures in the lower House. I could not and would not violate\r\ntheir trust now. And there was no authority on earth which I would\r\nrecognize as empowered to come between the people's will and the\r\npeople's elected servants.\r\n\r\nThe prophets received this defiance in silence. Their expressions\r\nimplied condemnation, but none was spoken--at least not while I was\r\nthere. President Woodruff indicated that the conference was at an\r\nend, so far as I was concerned; and I withdrew. Some attempts were\r\nsubsequently made to influence the people during the campaign, but in a\r\nhalf-hearted way and vainly. The Democrats carried Utah overwhelmingly;\r\nonly three Republican members of the legislature were elected out of\r\nsixty-three.\r\n\r\nIt was this conference in the Temple which gave me my first realization\r\nthat most of the Prophets had not, and never would have, any feeling of\r\ncitizenship in state or nation; that they considered, and would continue\r\nto consider, every public issue solely in its possible effect upon the\r\nfortunes of their Church. My father alone seemed to have a larger view;\r\nbut he was a statesman of full worldly knowledge; and his experience in\r\nCongress, during a part of the \"reconstruction period,\" and throughout\r\nthe Tilden-Hayes controversy, had taught him how effectively the\r\nnational power could assert itself. The others, blind to such dangers,\r\nseemed to feel that under Utah's sovereignty the literal \"kingdom\r\nof God\" (as they regard their Church) was to exercise an undisputed\r\nauthority. Unable, myself, to take their viewpoint, I was conscious of\r\na sense of transgression against the orthodoxy of their religion. I was\r\naware, for the first time, that in gaining the fraternity of American\r\ncitizenship I had in some way lost the fraternity of the faith in which\r\nI had been reared. I accepted this as a necessary consequence of our\r\nnew freedom--a freedom that left us less close and unyielding in our\r\nreligious loyalty by withdrawing the pressure that had produced our\r\ncompactness. And I hoped that, in time, the Prophets themselves--or,\r\nat least, their successors--would grow into a more liberal sense of\r\ncitizenship as their people grew. I knew that our progress must be a\r\nprocess of evolution. I was content to wait upon the slow amendments of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMy hope carried me through the disheartening incidents of the Senatorial\r\ncampaign that followed upon the election of the legislature--a campaign\r\nin which the power of the hierarchy was used publicly to defeat the\r\ndeposed apostle, Moses Thatcher, in his second candidacy for the\r\nUnited States Senate. But the Church only succeeded in defeating him by\r\nthrowing its influence to Joseph L. Rawlins, whom the Prophets loved as\r\nlittle as they loved Thatcher; and I felt that in Rawlins' election the\r\nstate at least gained a representative who was worthy of it.\r\n\r\nWhat was quite as sinister a use of Church influence occurred among the\r\nMormons of Idaho, where I went to help Senator Fred. T. Dubois in his\r\ncampaign for re-election. He had aided us in obtaining Utah's statehood\r\nas much as any man in Washington. He had accepted all the promises of\r\nthe Mormon leaders in good faith--particularly their promise that no\r\nChurch influence should intrude upon the politics of Idaho. Yet in his\r\ncampaign I was followed through the Mormon settlements by Charles W.\r\nPenrose, a polygamist, since an apostle of the Church, and at that time\r\neditor of the Church's official organ, the Deseret News.\r\n\r\nI supposed that he was lying in his claim to represent the Presidency;\r\nand as soon as I returned to Salt Lake, I went to Church headquarters\r\nand asked whether Penrose had been authorized to say (as he had been\r\nsaying) that he was sent out to prevent my making any misrepresentations\r\nof the political attitude of the Presidency.\r\n\r\nJoseph F. Smith replied, \"Yes,\"--speaking for himself and apparently for\r\nPresident Woodruff.\r\n\r\n\"And when\"--I demanded--\"when did I ever claim to represent or\r\nmisrepresent you in politics? Haven't I always said that I don't\r\nrecognize you as politicians--and always denied that you have any right\r\nto dictate the politics of our people?\"\r\n\r\nPresident Woodruff interposed gently:\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know, Frank, we have no criticism to pass on you, but we\r\nwere advised that you might tell the voters of Idaho we were friendly\r\nto Senator Dubois, and so we sent Brother Penrose, at the request of\r\nPresident Budge\" (a Mormon stake president in Idaho) \"to counsel\r\nour people. And Brother Penrose says you attacked him in one of your\r\nmeetings, and said he was not a trustworthy political guide.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Woodruff's mildness was always irresistible. \"If that's all\r\nhe told you I said about him,\" I replied, \"he didn't do justice to my\r\nremarks.\" And I explained that I had described Penrose as \"a lying, oily\r\nhypocrite,\" come to advise the Idaho Mormons that the Presidency wished\r\nthem to vote a certain political ticket although the Presidency had no\r\ninterest in the question and although I myself had taken to Washington\r\nthe Presidency's covenant of honor that the Church would never attempt\r\nto interfere in Idaho's political affairs.\r\n\r\nSmith sprang to his feet angrily. \"I don't care what has been promised\r\nto Dubois or anyone else,\" he said. \"He was the bitterest enemy our\r\npeople had in the old days, and I'll never give my countenance to him in\r\npolitics while the world stands. He sent many a one of our brethren\r\nto prison when he was marshal of the territory, and I can't forget his\r\ndevilish persecutions--even if you can.\"\r\n\r\nI closed the conversation by remarking that not one among us would have\r\nhad a vote as a citizen either of Utah or of Idaho if Dubois and men\r\nof his kind had not accepted our pledges of honor; and if we were\r\ndetermined to remember the persecutions and not the mercy, we ought to\r\ngo back to the conditions from which mercy had rescued us.\r\n\r\nI left for Washington, soon after, with an unhappy apprehension that\r\nthere were evil influences at work in Utah which might prove powerful\r\nenough to involve the whole community in the worst miseries of reaction.\r\nI saw those influences embodied in Joseph F. Smith; and because he was\r\nexplosive where others were reflective, he had now more influence\r\nthan previously--there being no longer any set resistance to him. The\r\nreverence of the Mormon people for the name of Smith was (as it had\r\nalways been) his chief asset of popularity. He had a superlative\r\nphysical impressiveness and a passion that seemed to take the place of\r\nmagnetism in public address. But he never said anything memorable; he\r\nnever showed any compelling ability of mind; he had a personal cunning\r\nwithout any large intelligence, and he was so many removes from the\r\nFirst Presidency that it seemed unlikely he would soon attain to\r\nthat position of which the power is so great that it only makes the\r\nblundering more dangerous than the astute.\r\n\r\nI was going to Washington, before Congress reconvened, to confer with\r\nSenator Redfield Proctor. He wished to see me about the new protective\r\ntariff bill that was proposed by the Republican leaders. I wished to ask\r\nhim not to use his political influence in Idaho against Senator Fred.\r\nT. Dubois, who had been Senator Proctor's political protege. I knew that\r\nSenator Proctor had once been given a semi-official promise that the\r\nMormon Church leaders would not interfere in Idaho against Dubois. I\r\nwished to tell Proctor that this promise was not being kept, and to\r\nplead with him to give Dubois fair play--although I knew that Senator\r\nDubois' \"insurgency\" had offended Senator Proctor.\r\n\r\nHe received me, in his home in Washington, with an almost paternal\r\nkindliness that became sometimes more dictatorial than persuasive--as\r\nthe manner of an older Senator is so apt to be when he wishes to correct\r\nthe independence of a younger colleague. He explained that the House\r\nwas Republican by a considerable majority; a good protective tariff\r\nbill would come from that body; and a careful canvass of the Senate had\r\nproved that the bill would pass there, if I would vote for it. \"We\r\nhave within one vote of a majority,\" he said. \"As you're a devoted\r\nprotectionist in your views--as your state is for protection--as your\r\nfather and your people feel grateful to the Republican party for leading\r\nyou out of the wilderness--I have felt that it was proper to appeal to\r\nyou and learn your views definitely. If you'll pledge your support to\r\nthe bill, we shall not look elsewhere for a vote--but it's essential\r\nthat we should be secure of a majority.\"\r\n\r\nI replied that I could not promise to vote for the measure until\r\nI should see it. It was true that I had been a devoted advocate of\r\nprotection and still believed in the principle; but I had learned\r\nsomething of the way in which tariff bills were framed, and something of\r\nthe influences that controlled the party councils in support of them. I\r\ncould not be sure that the new measure would be any more just than the\r\noriginal Dingley bill, which I had helped to defeat in the Senate;\r\nand the way in which this bill had been driven through the House was a\r\nsufficient warning to me not to harness myself in a pledge that might be\r\nmisused in legislation.\r\n\r\nSenator Proctor did me the honor to say that he did not suppose any\r\nimproper suggestion of personal advantage could influence me, and he\r\nhoped I knew him too well to suppose that he would use such an argument;\r\n\"but,\" he added, \"anything that it's within the 'political' power of the\r\nparty to bestow, you may expect; I'm authorized to say that we will take\r\ncare of you.\"\r\n\r\nAs I still refused to bind myself blindly, he said, with regret: \"We had\r\ngreat hopes of you. It seems that we must look elsewhere. I will leave\r\nthe question open. If you conclude to assure us of your vote for\r\nthe bill, I shall see that you are restored to a place in Republican\r\ncouncils. If I do not hear anything from you, it will be necessary\r\nto address ourselves to one or two other Senators who are probably\r\navailable.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, a doctrine of present-day Republicanism that the will\r\nof the majority must rule within the party. An insurgent is therefore\r\nan apostate. The decision of the caucus is the infallible declaration of\r\nthe creed. In setting myself up as a judge of what it was right for me\r\nto do, as the sworn representative of the people who had elected me, I\r\nwas offending against party orthodoxy, as that orthodoxy was then, and\r\nis now, enforced in Washington.\r\n\r\nI was given an opportunity to return to conformity. I was sent a\r\nwritten invitation to attend the caucus of Republican Senators after the\r\nassembling of Congress; and, with the other \"insurgents,\" I ignored\r\nthe invitation. It was finally decided by the party leaders to let the\r\ntariff bill rest until after the inauguration of the President-elect,\r\nWilliam McKinley, with the understanding that he would call a special\r\nsession to consider it; and, in the interval, the Republican machine,\r\nunder Mark Hanna, was set to work to produce a Republican majority in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nHanna was elected Senator, at this time, to succeed John Sherman, who\r\nhad been removed to the office of Secretary of State, in order to make\r\na seat for Hanna. The Republican majority was produced. (Senator Dubois\r\nhad been defeated). And when the special session was called, in the\r\nspring of 1897, my vote was no longer so urgently needed. I was invited\r\nto a Republican caucus, but I was unwilling to return to political\r\naffiliations which I might have to renounce again; for I saw the power\r\nof the business interests in dictating the policy of the party and I did\r\nnot propose to bow to that dictation.\r\n\r\nWhen the tariff bill came before the Senate, I could not in conscience\r\nsupport it. The beneficiaries of the bill seemed to be dictating their\r\nown schedules, and this was notably the case with the sugar trust, which\r\nhad obtained a differential between raw and refined sugar several times\r\ngreater than the entire cost of refining. I denounced the injustice of\r\nthe sugar schedule particularly. A Mr. Oxnard came to remonstrate with\r\nme on behalf of the beet sugar industry of the West. \"You know,\" he\r\nsaid, \"what a hard time we're having with our sugar companies. Unless\r\nthis schedule's adopted I greatly fear for our future.\"\r\n\r\nI replied that I was not opposing any protection of the struggling\r\nindustries of the country, or of the sugar growers, but I was set\r\nagainst the extortionate differential that the sugar trust was\r\ndemanding. Everybody knew that the trust had built its tremendous\r\nindustrial power upon such criminally high protection as this\r\ndifferential afforded, and that its power now affected public councils,\r\nobtained improper favors, and terrorized the small competing beet\r\nsugar companies of the West. I argued that it was time to rally for the\r\nprotection of the people as well as of the beet sugar industry.\r\n\r\nHe predicted that if the differential was reduced the protection on beet\r\nsugar would fail. I laughed at him. \"You don't know the temper of\r\nthe Senate,\" I said. \"Why, even some of the Democrats are in favor\r\nof protecting the beet sugar industry. That part of the bill is safe,\r\nwhatever happens to the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Senator Cannon,\" he replied, with all the scorn of superior knowledge,\r\n\"you're somewhat new to this matter. Permit me to inform you that if\r\nwe don't do our part in supporting the sugar schedule, including the\r\ndifferential, the friends of the schedule in the Senate will prevent us\r\nfrom obtaining our protection.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" I retorted angrily, \"is equivalent to saying that the sugar\r\ntrust is writing the sugar schedule. I can't listen with patience to any\r\nsuch insult. The Senate of the United States cannot be dictated to, in\r\na matter of such importance, by the trust. I will not vote for the\r\ndifferential. I will continue to oppose it to the end. If you're\r\nright--if the trust has such power--better that our struggling sugar\r\nindustry should perish, so that we may arouse the people to the\r\niniquitous manipulation that destroyed it.\"\r\n\r\nI continued to oppose the schedule. Soon after, I received a message\r\nfrom the Church authorities asking me to go to New York to attend to\r\nsome of their financial affairs. I entered the lobby of the Plaza Hotel\r\non Fifth Avenue about nine o'clock at night; I was met, unexpectedly, by\r\nThomas R. Cutler, manager of the Utah Sugar Company, who was a Bishop of\r\nthe Mormon Church; and he asked, almost at once, how the tariff bill was\r\nprogressing at Washington.\r\n\r\nI had known Bishop Cutler for years. I knew that he had labored with\r\nextraordinary zeal and intelligence to establish the sugar industry in\r\nUtah. I understood that he had risked his own property, unselfishly,\r\nto save the enterprise when it was in peril. And I had every reason to\r\nexpect that he would be as indignant as I was, at the proposal to use\r\nthe support of the beet sugar states in behalf of their old tyrant.\r\n\r\nI told him of my conversation with Oxnard. \"I'm glad,\" I said, \"that\r\nwe're independent enough to refuse such an alliance with the men who are\r\nrobbing the country.\"\r\n\r\nA peculiar, pale smile curled Bishop Cutler's thin lips. \"Well, Frank,\"\r\nhe replied, \"that's just what I want to see you about. We\"--with the\r\nintonation that is used among prominent Mormons when the \"we\" are\r\nvoicing the conclusions of the hierarchy--\"wouldn't like to do anything\r\nto hurt the sugar interests of the country. I've looked into this\r\ndifferential, and I don't see that it is particularly exorbitant. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the American Sugar Refining Company is doing all it can\r\nto help us get our needed protection, and we have promised to do what we\r\ncan for it, in return. I hope you can see your way clear to vote for the\r\nbill. I know that the brethren\"--meaning the Church authorities--\"will\r\nnot approve of your opposition to it.\"\r\n\r\nI understand what his quiet warning meant, and when we had parted I\r\nwent to my room to face the situation. Already I had been told, by a\r\nrepresentative of the Union Pacific Railway, that the company intended\r\nto make Utah the legal home of the corporation, and to enter into a\r\nclose affiliation with the prominent men of the Church. I had been asked\r\nto participate, and I had refused because I did not feel free, as a\r\nSenator, to become interested in a company whose relations with the\r\ngovernment were of such a character. But I had not foreseen what this\r\naffiliation meant. Bishop Cutler's warning opened my eyes. The Church\r\nwas protecting itself, in its commercial undertakings, by an alliance\r\nwith the strongest and most unscrupulous of the national enemies.\r\n\r\nI saw that this was natural. The Mormon leaders had been for years\r\nstruggling to save their community from poverty. Proscribed by the\r\nFederal laws, their home industries suffering for want of finances,\r\nfighting against the allied influences of business in politics, these\r\nleaders had been taught to feel a fearful respect for the power that had\r\noppressed them. They were now being offered the aid and countenance of\r\ntheir old opponents. Our community, so long the object of the world's\r\ndisdain, was to advance to favor and prosperity along the easy road of\r\nassociation with the most influential interests of the country.\r\n\r\nI remembered the long hard struggle of our people. I remembered the days\r\nand nights of anxiety that I myself had known when we were friendless\r\nand proscribed. Here was an open door for us, now, to power and wealth\r\nand all the comfort and consideration that would come of these. Other\r\nmen better than I in personal character, more experienced in legislation\r\nthan I, and wiser by natural gift, were willing to vote for the bill;\r\nand Bishop Cutler, a man whom I had always esteemed, the representative\r\nof the men whom I most revered, had urged me, for them, to support the\r\nbill, under suggestion of their anger if I refused to be guided by their\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nI saw why the \"interests\" were eager to have our friendship; we could\r\ngive them more than any other community of our size in the whole\r\ncountry. In the final analysis, the laws of our state and the\r\nadministration of its government would be in the hands of the church\r\nauthorities. Moses Thatcher might lead a rebellion for a time, but it\r\nwould be brief. Brigham H. Roberts might avow his independence in some\r\nwonderful burst of campaign oratory, but he would be forced to fast and\r\npray and see visions until he yielded. I might rebel and be successful\r\nfor a moment, but the inexorable power of church control would crush me\r\nat last. Yet, if I surrendered in this matter of the tariff, I should\r\nbe doing exactly what I had criticized so many of my colleagues for\r\ndoing--for more than one man in the House and the Senate had given me\r\nthe specious excuse that it was necessary to go against his conscience,\r\nhere, in order to hold his influence and his power to do good in other\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nI did not sleep that night. On the day following, I transacted the\r\nfinancial affairs that I had been asked to undertake, and then I\r\nreturned to Washington. My wife met me at the railway station, and--if\r\nyou will bear with the intimacy of such psychology--the moment I saw\r\nher I knew how I would vote. I knew that neither the plea of community\r\nambition, nor the equally invalid argument of an industrial need at\r\nhome, nor the financial jeopardy of my friends who had invested in our\r\nhome industries, nor the fear of church antagonism, could justify me in\r\nwhat would be, for me, an act of perfidy. When I had taken my oath of\r\noffice I had pledged myself, in the memory of old days of injustice,\r\nnever to vote as a Senator for an act of injustice. The test had come.\r\nBy all the sanctities of that old suffering and the promise that I had\r\nmade in its spirit, I would keep the faith.\r\n\r\nWhen the tariff bill came to its final vote in the Senate, I had the\r\nunhappy distinction of being the only Republican Senator who voted\r\nagainst it. A useless sacrifice! And yet if it had been my one act of\r\npublic life, I should still be glad of it. The \"interests\" that forced\r\nthe passage of that bill are those that have since exploited the country\r\nso shamefully. It is their control of Republican party councils that has\r\nsince caused the loss of popular faith in Republicanism and the split in\r\nthe party which threatens to disrupt it. It is their control of politics\r\nin Utah that has destroyed the whole value of the Mormon experiment\r\nin communism and made the Mormon Church an instrument of political\r\noppression for commercial gain. They are the most dangerous domestic\r\nenemy that the nation has known since the close of the Civil War. My\r\nopposition was as doomed as such single independence must always be--but\r\nat least it was an opposition. There is a consolation in having been\r\nright, though you may have been futile!\r\n\r\nMy father, visiting Washington soon afterwards, took occasion to\r\ncriticize my vote publicly, in a newspaper interview; but he was\r\ncontent, by that criticism, to clear himself and his colleagues of\r\nany responsibility for my act. \"You made a great mistake,\" he told me\r\nprivately. \"You are alienating the friends who have done so much for\r\nus.\" He added as if casually--with an air of off-handedness that was\r\nsignificant to me--\"You lay yourself open to attack from your political\r\nenemies. When a man's head is high, it is easily hit.\" I was afterwards\r\nto understand how serious a danger he then foresaw and thus predicted.\r\n\r\nMany reports soon reached me of attacks that were being made upon me\r\nby the ecclesiastical authorities, particularly by Joseph F. Smith and\r\nApostle Heber J. Grant. The formal criticism passed upon me by my father\r\nwas magnified to make my tariff vote appear an inexcusable party and\r\ncommunity defection. A vigorous and determined opposition was raised\r\nagainst me. And in this, Smith and his followers were aided by\r\nthe perfect system of Church control in Utah--a system of complete\r\necclesiastical tyranny under the guise of democracy.\r\n\r\nPractically every Mormon man is in the priesthood. Nearly every Mormon\r\nman has some concrete authority to exercise in addition to holding his\r\nordination as an elder. Obedience to his superiors is essential to his\r\nambition to rise to higher dignity in the church; and obedience to his\r\nsuperiors is necessary in order to attract obedience to himself from his\r\nsubordinates. There can be no lay jealousy of priestly interference in\r\npolitics, because there are no laymen in the proper sense of the word.\r\nA man's worldly success in life is largely involved in his success as\r\na churchman, since the church commands the opportunities of enterprise,\r\nand the leaders of the Church are the state's most powerful men of\r\naffairs. It is not uncommon, in any of our American communities, for men\r\nto use their church membership to support their business; but in Utah\r\nthe Mormons practically must do so, and even the Gentiles find it wise\r\nto be subservient.\r\n\r\nAdd to this temporal power of the Church the fact that it was\r\nestablishing a policy of seeking material success for its people, and\r\nyou have the explanation of its eagerness to accept an alliance with the\r\n\"interests\" and of its hostility to anyone who opposed that alliance.\r\nThe Mormons, dispossessed of their means by the migration from Illinois,\r\nhad been taught the difficulty of obtaining wealth and the value of it\r\nwhen once obtained. They fancied themselves set apart, in the mountains,\r\nby the world's exclusion. They were ambitious to make themselves as\r\nfinancially powerful in proportion to their numbers as the Jews were;\r\nand it was a common argument among them that the world's respect had\r\nturned to the Jews because of the dependence of Christian governments\r\nupon the Jewish financiers.\r\n\r\nThe exploitation of this solid mass of industry and thrift could not\r\nlong be obscured from the eyes of the East. The honest desire of the\r\nMormon leaders to benefit their people by an alliance with financial\r\npower made them the easy victims of such an alliance. With the death\r\nof the older men of the hierarchy, the Church administration lost its\r\ntradition of religious leadership for the good of the community solely,\r\nand the new leaders became eager for financial aggrandizement for\r\nthe sake, of power. Like every other church that has added a temporal\r\nscepter to its spiritual authority, its pontiffs have become kings of a\r\ncivil government instead of primates of a religious faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. At the Crossways\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1897, the Church, freed of proscription, with its people enjoying the\r\nsovereignty of their state rights, had--as I have already said--only one\r\nfurther enfranchisement to desire: and that was its freedom from debt.\r\nThe informal \"finance committee\" of which I was a member, had succeeded\r\nin concentrating the bulk of the indebtedness in the East, on short term\r\nloans, and had brought a certain order out of the confusion of the\r\nolder methods of administration. But, in 1897, my father proposed a\r\ncomprehensive plan of Church finance that included the issuance of\r\nChurch bonds and the formation of responsible committees to regulate and\r\nmanage the business affairs of the Church, so that the bonds might be\r\nmade a normal investment for Eastern capital by having a normal business\r\nmethod of administration to back them. The idea was tentatively approved\r\nby the Presidency, and I was asked to draw up the plan in detail.\r\n\r\nTo this end there were placed in my hands sheets showing the assets,\r\nliabilities, revenues and disbursements of the Church. They gave a total\r\ncash indebtedness of $1,200,000, approximately. The revenues from\r\ntithes for the year 1897 were estimated at a trifle more than a million\r\ndollars--the total being low because of the financial depression\r\nfrom which the country was just recovering. The available property\r\nholdings--exclusive of premises used for religious worship, for\r\neducational and benevolent work, and such kindred purposes--were valued\r\nat several millions (from four to six), although there was no definite\r\nappraisal or means of obtaining appraisal, since the values would\r\nlargely attach only when the properties were brought into business use.\r\nI was advised that the incomes of the Church would probably increase\r\nat the rate of ten per cent per annum, but I do not know by what\r\ncalculations this ratio was reached.\r\n\r\nThe disbursements were chiefly for interest on debt, for the maintenance\r\nof the temples and tabernacles, for educational and charitable work,\r\nfor missionary headquarters in other countries, and for the return\r\nof released missionaries. The missionaries themselves received no\r\ncompensation; they were supposed to travel \"without purse or scrip;\"\r\ntheir expenses were defrayed by their relatives, and they had to pay\r\nout of their own pockets for the printed tracts which they distributed.\r\nNeither the President nor any of the general authorities received\r\nsalaries. There was an order that each apostle should be paid $2,000 a\r\nyear, but this rule had been suspended, except, perhaps, in the cases\r\nof men who had to give their whole time to religious work and who had\r\nno independent incomes. Some occasional appropriations had been made for\r\nmeeting houses in communities that had been unable to erect their own\r\nchapels of worship, but for the most part there were few calls made upon\r\nthe Church revenues to support its religious activities, its priests or\r\nits propaganda.\r\n\r\nOur proposed committees, therefore, were a committee on missionary work,\r\none on publication, one on colonization, one on political protective\r\nwork for the Mormons in foreign countries, and most important--a finance\r\ncommittee selected from the body of apostles, with the addition of some\r\nable men connected with financial institutions. As a basis for the work\r\nof the finance committee, we proposed the establishment of an interest\r\nfund, a sinking fund, and a scale of percentage disbursements for the\r\nvarious community purposes. These committees were to be appointed by the\r\nConferences of the people, and the committee reports were to be public.\r\nPresident Woodruff eagerly accepted the plan as relieving the Presidency\r\nof administrative cares that were becoming too great for the quorum to\r\ncarry. Joseph F. Smith did not at once awake to the real meaning of the\r\nproposal; but when the scheme was submitted in its matured details,\r\nhe spoke of the danger of allowing power to pass from the hands of the\r\n\"trustee in trust\" in business matters. His idea was sufficiently\r\nclear in its resistance to any diffusion of authority, but it was\r\ncorrespondingly void of any suggestion of substitute. For the time being\r\nhe was pacified by the assurance that the \"Kingdom of God\" and the\r\nrule of its prophets would not be endangered by the organization\r\nof committees and the submission of financial plans to the general\r\nknowledge, and even to the consent, of the people.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, evident to the First Councillor that this scheme\r\nof Church administration would give the Mormon people a measure of\r\nresponsible government, and the proposal was a part of his wisdom as a\r\ncommunity leader seeking the common welfare. While we had been a people\r\non whom the whole world seemed to be making war, a dictatorship had\r\nbeen necessary; but now that we had arrived at peace and liberty, a\r\nconcentration of irresponsible power would surely become dangerous to\r\nprogress. Without, therefore, impairing the religious authority of the\r\nProphet, the First Councillor was willing to divide the temporal power\r\nof the Church among its members.\r\n\r\nHe was as silent, about these aims, with me as with all others; but I\r\nhad learned to understand him in his silences; and, in joining with him\r\nin his work of reform, I was as sure of his purpose as I have since been\r\nsure of the disaster to the Mormon people that has come of the failure\r\nto effect the reform.\r\n\r\nWhen the Presidency had approved of the flotation of bonds, I went with\r\nmy father to New York to aid him in interesting Eastern capitalists\r\nin the investment. We interviewed Judge John F. Dillon and Mr. Winslow\r\nPierce, of the law firm of Dillon and Pierce, attorneys for some of the\r\nUnion Pacific interests; and through them we met Mr. Edward H. Harriman,\r\nMr. George J. Gould and members of the firm of Kuhn Loeb and Company. It\r\nwas interesting to watch the encounters between the Mormon prophet and\r\nsome of these astutest of the nation's financiers; for it was as if one\r\nof the ancient patriarchs had stepped down from the days of early Israel\r\nto discuss the financial problems of his people with a modern \"captain\r\nof industry.\" He described a condition of society that was, to Wall\r\nStreet, archaic. He spoke with a serene assurance that the order of\r\naffairs in Utah was constituted in the wisdom of the word of God. He\r\nwas listened to, with the interest of curiosity, as the chief living\r\nexponent of the Mormon movement, its processes and its aims; and I\r\nwas impressed by the fact that these men of the world had a large and\r\nsplendid sympathy for any wholesome social effort designed to abolish\r\npoverty and establish a quicker justice in the practical affairs of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIt was of the abolition of poverty and the justice of the social order\r\namong the Mormons, that the First Councillor chiefly spoke. \"Your\r\nclients,\" he said to Judge Dillon, \"make their investments frequently in\r\nrailroad stocks and bonds. What are the underlying bases of the values\r\nof railroad securities? Largely the industry and stability of the\r\ncommunities through which the railroad lines shall operate. Then, in\r\nreality, the security is valuable in proportion to the value of the\r\ncommunity in its steadfastness, its prosperity and the safety of its\r\nproductive labor. In your railroad investments you are obliged to take\r\nsuch considerations as a secondary security. In negotiating this Church\r\nloan with your clients, you can offer the same great values as a primary\r\nsecurity. Probably no where else in the world is there a people at once\r\nso industrious and so stable as ours.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the boast of the Mormons that there had not been an almshouse or\r\nan almstaker in any of their settlements, up to the time of the escheat\r\nproceedings by the Federal officials; and this was literally true. Every\r\nman had been helped to the employment for which he was best fitted. If\r\nan immigrant, in his former estate, had been a silk-weaver, efforts were\r\nmade to establish his industry and give it public support. If he had\r\nbeen a musician of talent, a little conservatory was founded, and\r\npatronage obtained for him. When the growth of population made it\r\nnecessary to open new valleys for agriculture, the Church, out of its\r\ncommunity fund, rendered the initial aid; in many instances the original\r\nirrigation enterprises of small settlements were thus financed; and the\r\ninvestments were repaid not only directly, by the return of the loan,\r\nbut indirectly, many times over, by the increased productiveness\r\nand larger contributions of the people. Co-operation, in mercantile,\r\nindustrial and stock-raising undertakings, assured the support and\r\npatronage of each community for its own particular enterprise, prevented\r\ndestructive competition and checked the greed of the individual--for the\r\nmore he toiled for himself, the larger the share of the general burden\r\nhe had to carry.\r\n\r\nIt was the First Councillor's theory that when people contributed to a\r\ncommon fund they became interested in one another's material welfare.\r\nThe man who paid less in tithes this year than last was counselled with\r\nas to why his business had been unsuccessful, and the wise men of his\r\nlittle circle aided him with advice and material help. The man who\r\ncontributed largely was glad of a prosperity from which he yielded a\r\npart--in recognition of what the community had done for him and in\r\na reverent gratitude to God for making him \"a steward of mighty\r\npossessions\"--but he was anxious that his neighbor also should be a\r\nlarger contributor each year.\r\n\r\nThe whole system of tithe-paying was built upon a series of purported\r\n\"revelations\" received by Joseph Smith, the original Prophet. It was\r\ndeclared to be the will of God that all men, as stewards of their\r\npossessions, should give of their increase annually into \"the storehouse\r\nof the Lord,\" which should always be open for the relief of the poor.\r\nInasmuch as the man who received help--or whose widow and children did\r\nso--had been a tithe-payer during all his productive years, there\r\nwas none of the feeling of personal humiliation on the part of the\r\nrecipient, nor any of the feeling of condescending charity on the part\r\nof the giver, in the distribution of funds to the needy. And it was\r\nastonishing how few the needy were--because of the abstemious lives, the\r\nindustry, and the thrift of the workers.\r\n\r\nThe Church tribunals heard and settled all disputes over property or\r\npersonal rights not involving the criminal law. Expensive litigation was\r\nthus avoided. Society was saved the cost of innumerable courts. There\r\nwere many counties in which no lawyer could be found; and everywhere,\r\namong the Mormons, it was considered an act of evil fellowship,\r\namounting almost to apostasy, for a man to bring suit against his\r\nbrother in the civil tribunals.\r\n\r\nIn short--as my father pointed out--Utah, at that time, expressed the\r\nonly full-bodied social proposition in the United States. There never\r\nhad been in America another community whose future, in the economic\r\naspects, offered so clear a solution of problems which still remain\r\ngenerally unsettled. It was as if a segment of the great circle of\r\nmodern humanity had been transported to another world, otherwise\r\nunpopulated, and there with the experience gained through centuries of\r\nhuman travail--had attempted the establishment of a just, beneficent and\r\nsatisfying social order.\r\n\r\nI am here repeating this argument--this exposition--because the\r\nfinancial absolutism of the Prophets of the Church has since ruined the\r\nwhole Mormon experiment in communism, put the Mormon paupers into the\r\npublic poor houses, used the tithes to support the large financial\r\nventures of the Prophet's favorites, and turned the Church's \"community\r\nenterprises\" into monopolistic exploitations of the Mormon people.\r\nAnd this change began even while our negotiations were pending in New\r\nYork--for they were prolonged, for various reasons, into the summer\r\nof 1898, and they were interrupted finally by the death of President\r\nWoodruff.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I received word of his illness I took train for Utah.\r\nThe news of his death met me on the journey home. Since I derived my\r\nauthority solely from him, upon my arrival in Salt Lake I went to the\r\nCashier of the Church, gave him the keys and the password to the safety\r\ndeposit box in New York, and withdrew from any further participation\r\nin the Church's financial affairs. When I came to the office of the\r\nPresidency I found that my father had removed his desk; and this was an\r\nindication to me of what was happening in the inner circles of Church\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\nThe president of the quorum of apostles invariably succeeds to the\r\nPresidency of the Church, although it is left to the apostles to decide,\r\nand their choice is supposed to be directed by inspiration. His\r\nelection is subsequently ratified by the General Conference; but this\r\nratification is a mere form, because the conference must either accept\r\nthe choice of the apostles or rebel against \"the revelation of God.\"\r\n\r\nApostle Lorenzo Snow was president of the quorum of apostles, and\r\ntherefore in line for the Presidency. But usually, after the death of\r\na President, a considerable period was allowed to elapse before the\r\nselection of his successor, with the government resting in the quorum\r\nof apostles meanwhile, even for a term of years. As soon as I arrived\r\nin Salt Lake, Apostle Snow asked me to a private interview (in the\r\nsame small back room of the President's offices), inquired about the\r\nfinancial negotiations that I had been conducting, and asked me whether\r\nit was not essential to the success of our business affairs that as soon\r\nas possible the Church should elect a President, empowered as \"trustee\r\nin trust.\" I replied that it was. He invited me to attend a conference\r\nof the apostles and give my views upon the situation to them.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to me an act of rather shallow cunning, for I knew I was\r\ntoo unimportant a person to be so consulted unless he thought my report\r\nwould aid his intrigue. Such intriguing was offensive to the religious\r\ntraditions of the Church; and it outraged my feeling for President\r\nWoodruff, who was hardly cold in death before this personal and worldly\r\nambition caught at the reins of his office. Snow had been a man of\r\nsmall weight in the government of the Church. He had known none of the\r\nresponsibilities of great leadership. He was eighty-four years old.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was impossible for us to maintain the Church's credit in\r\nthe East unless our community were represented by some choate authority,\r\nsince our credit rested on the belief that the Mormon people were ready\r\nto consecrate all their possessions at any time to the service of the\r\nChurch at the command of the President. I advised the apostles of this\r\nfact. Snow was elected President on September 13, 1898, eleven days\r\nafter Woodruff's death. He followed the usual precedent in choosing my\r\nfather and Joseph F. Smith as his Councillor's.\r\n\r\nBut he took possession of his new authority with the manner of an heir\r\nentering upon the ownership of a personal estate for which he had long\r\nwaited--and which he proposed to enjoy to the full for his remaining\r\nyears. In a most literal sense he held that all the property of the\r\npeople of the Church was subject to his direction, as chief earthly\r\nsteward of \"the Divine Monarch,\" and he proceeded to exercise his\r\nassumed prerogatives with an autocracy that made even Joseph F. Smith\r\ncomplain because the Councillor's were never asked for counsel. As\r\nresident apostle of Box Elder County and president of the Box Elder\r\n\"stake of Zion,\" Snow had already shown his ambition as a financier,\r\ndisastrously; and it was as the financial head of the Church that he was\r\nchiefly to rule during his term of absolutism.\r\n\r\nOf all the Church leaders whom I had known he was the only man who\r\nshowed none of the robustness of the Western experience. Tall, stately,\r\nwhite-bearded, elegant and courtly, he prided himself most obviously on\r\nhis manners and his culture. He rarely spoke in any but the most subdued\r\nand silken tones of suavity. He walked with a step that was almost\r\naffected in its gentility. If he had any passions, he held them in such\r\nsmooth concealment that the public credited him with neither force\r\nnor unkindness. He had been a great traveler (as a missionary); he had\r\nwritten his autobiography, somewhat egotistically; he was devoted to\r\nthe forms of his religion, like a mediaeval Prince of the Church and\r\nan elegante. But under all the artificialities of personal vanity and\r\nexterior grace, he proved to have a cold determination that seemed more\r\nselfishly ambitious than religiously zealous.\r\n\r\nAt once, upon his accession to power, he notified us that he did\r\nnot intend to carry out any such plan as we had suggested for the\r\nadministration of the Church's finances. It meant a diffusion of\r\nauthority; and he held that the best results had been obtained by\r\nkeeping all power in the hands of the Prophet, Seer and Revelator, and\r\nof those whom he might appoint to work with him. Joseph F. Smith, at\r\na meeting of the Presidency, was even more positive. No good, he said,\r\ncould come of publishing the affairs of the community to the people\r\nof it; those affairs were purely the concern of the Prophets; the Lord\r\nrevealed His will to the Prophets and they were responsible only to Him.\r\n\r\nMy father necessarily bowed to the President's decision. \"It is within\r\nthe authority of the Prophet of the Lord,\" he counselled me, \"to\r\ndetermine how he will conduct the business of the Church. President Snow\r\nhas his own ideas.\"\r\n\r\nBy that decision, as I see it now, an autocracy of financial power was\r\nconfirmed to the President of the Mormon Church at a time when a renewal\r\nof prosperity among its people was about to make such power fatal to\r\ntheir liberties. It was confirmed to a man who proved himself eager for\r\nit, ambitious to increase it and secretly unscrupulous in his use of\r\nit. He proceeded at once to preach the doctrine of contribution with\r\nunexampled zeal, but he administered the \"common fund,\" so collected,\r\nwith none of the old feeling of responsibility to the people who\r\ncontributed it He became the first of the new financial pontiffs of\r\nthe Church who have used the \"money power\" as an aid to hierarchical\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in his desire to fill the coffers of the Church, he engaged in\r\n\"practical politics\" and made a profit out of Church influence, both\r\nin business enterprises and in political campaigns. He proved himself\r\npeculiarly qualified by nature to construct and direct a secret\r\npolitical machine--a machine whose operations were never to be\r\nobservable except to the close student of Utah's ecclesiasticism--a\r\nmachine that was to be all the more effective because of its silent\r\ncertainty. As the succeeding chapters of this narrative will show,\r\nalthough he affected a fine superiority to unclean political work and\r\nalways publicly professed that the Church of Christ was holding itself\r\naloof from the strife of partisanship, there was no political event on\r\nwhich he did not fix the calculating eye of his ambitious clericalism\r\nand no candidacy that he did not reach with those slender but powerful\r\nfingers that controlled the destiny of a state and trifled with the\r\nhonor of a people.\r\n\r\nHis accession marked the change from the old to the new regime in Utah.\r\nLeadership was no longer a dangerous honor. Proscription no longer made\r\nthe authorities of the Church strong by persecution--hardy chiefs of a\r\npoverty-stricken people--leaders as sensible of the obligations of power\r\nas their followers were faithful in their allegiance of duty. Political\r\nfreedom and worldly prosperity made the office of President a luxurious\r\nsovereignty, easily tyrannical, fortified in its religious absolutism by\r\nits irresponsible power of finance, and protected in its social abuses,\r\nfrom the interference of the nation, by an alliance with the commercial\r\nrulers of the nation and by a duplicity that worldliness has learned to\r\ndignify with the respectability of material success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X. On the Downward Path\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last years of President Woodruff's life there had been a slow\r\ndecline of the feeling that it was necessary for self-protection that\r\nthe hierarchy should preserve a political control over the people. I\r\ncannot say that the feeling had wholly passed. It had continued to show\r\nitself, here and there, whenever a candidate was so pertinacious in\r\nhis independence that words of disfavor were sent out from Church\r\nheadquarters in one of those whispers that carry to the confines of the\r\nkingdom of the priests. But the progress was apparent. The tendency was\r\nclear. And in 1898 there was neither internal revolt nor external threat\r\nto provoke a renewal of the exercise of that force which is necessarily\r\ndespotic if it be used at all.\r\n\r\nYet, in September, 1898, President Snow, if he did not instigate, at\r\nleast authorized the candidacy of Brigham H. Roberts for Congress--a\r\npolygamist who had been threatened with excommunication for his\r\nopposition to the \"political manifesto\" of 1896 and who had recanted and\r\nmade his peace with the hierarchy. His election, now, would be a proof\r\nthat the Church could punish a brilliant orator and courageous citizen\r\nin the time of his independence and then reward him in the day of his\r\nsubmission; and the authorities would thus demonstrate to all the people\r\nthat the one way to political preferment lay through the annihilation of\r\nself-will and the submergence of national loyalty in priestly devotion.\r\nSuch a candidacy was a sufficient shame to the state; but there was\r\nalso a United States Senatorship to be bestowed; and it was deliberately\r\nbargained for, between the Church authorities and a man who deserved\r\nbetter than the alliance into which he entered.\r\n\r\nAlfred W. McCune was a citizen of Utah who had gone out from the\r\nterritory in the days of its poverty (and his own), had made a fortune\r\nin British Columbia and Montana, and had returned to his home state to\r\nenrich it with his generosities. He was not a Mormon, but he had wide\r\nMormon connections. He spent his millions in public enterprises and\r\nbenefactions; and the Church had benefited in the sum of many thousands\r\nby his subscriptions to its funds and institutions.\r\n\r\nApostle Heber J. Grant, a Republican by sentiment but a Democrat by\r\npretension, was selected by President Snow to barter the Senatorship to\r\nMcCune. There can be no doubt of it. Everyone immediately suspected\r\nit. Letters from Grant, published in the newspapers of January, 1899,\r\nsubsequently confirmed it. And President Snow's actions, toward the end\r\nof the campaign, proved it.\r\n\r\nThe other candidates were Judge O. W. Powers, a prominent Democrat;\r\nWilliam H. King, also a Democrat, a former member of Congress and at one\r\ntime a Federal judge; and myself as an independent Silver Republican.\r\nI had not allied myself with the Democrats after withdrawing from\r\nthe Republican convention of 1896, and the Republican machine in\r\nUtah (thanks to the power of the \"interests\") had repudiated me, in\r\nSeptember, 1898, by adopting a platform that refused to support as\r\nSenator any man who had opposed the Dingley Tariff Bill. But I had the\r\nvotes of my own county of Weber, and some other votes that had been\r\npledged to me before the election of members of the legislature; and\r\nthough my return to the Senate seemed plainly impossible, I went into\r\nthe fight in fulfillment of understandings which I had with progressive\r\nelements in Utah and with the \"insurgents,\" of that day, in Washington.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign to elect members of the Legislature, I supported the\r\nDemocratic State and Congressional ticket. Brigham H. Roberts had been\r\nnominated for Congress on this ticket despite the protests of my father\r\nand many others who foresaw the evil results of electing a polygamist. I\r\naccepted Roberts' nomination as proof that this question must be settled\r\nanew at Washington; and I contented myself with predicting, throughout\r\nthe campaign, that the House of Representatives would determine whether\r\nit would admit a polygamist and a member of the hierarchy as a lawmaker,\r\nand would so forever dispose of these ecclesiastical candidacies of\r\nwhich Utah refused to dispose for itself. (And it is a fact that since\r\nthe prompt exclusion of Roberts from the House of Representatives no\r\nknown polygamist has been elected to either House of Congress.)\r\n\r\nA Democratic legislature was elected, and A. W. McCune was put forward\r\nprominently as a candidate for the United States senatorship. He was\r\nassisted by his own newspaper, the Salt Lake Herald, by numberless\r\nbusiness interests, cleverly by the Deseret News (the organ of the\r\nhierarchy) flagrantly and for financial reasons by Apostle Heber J.\r\nGrant, and incidentally by the Smiths on behalf of the Church. Also\r\na Republican assistance was given him by my former colleague in the\r\nSenate, Arthur Brown, who specialized as an opponent to my candidacy.\r\n\r\nMy old campaign manager, Ben Rich, had been withdrawn from me by a\r\nChurch order appointing him in control of the Eastern missions. I\r\nwas without the support of either the Democratic or Republican\r\norganizations: my following was a personal one: and consequently the\r\nattack upon me chiefly took the form of stories of personal immorality,\r\nprivately circulated. These stories culminated in a motion before the\r\nWoman's Republican Club, demanding my withdrawal from the Senatorial\r\ncontest on the ground of \"gross misconduct\"--a motion introduced by a\r\nMrs. Anna M. Bradley, a woman politician (who was a stranger to me),\r\nwith the assistance of Mrs. Arthur Brown, wife of the former Senator.\r\n\r\nIf I ever had any resentment against these unfortunate women for\r\nallowing themselves to be used as the agents of slander, it passed\r\nin the miseries that overtook them later; for Mrs. Brown died of the\r\nscandal of her husband's intimacy with Mrs. Bradley, and Mrs. Bradley\r\nshot and killed ex-Senator Brown, in a Washington hotel, because he\r\nrefused to marry her and recognize her child after her divorce from her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nMy anger then, and since, was not against the women, but against the\r\nmen who hid behind them--against Apostle Heber J. Grant and Apostle John\r\nHenry Smith and their tool, ex-Senator Brown. In my anger I decided to\r\ntake an action that looked as desperate as it proved successful. I hired\r\nthe Salt Lake Theatre--for a night (February 9, 1899), and announced\r\nthat I would speak on \"Senatorial Candidates and Pharisees\"--intending\r\nto use the opportunity of self-defense in order to attack the \"financial\r\napostles\" who were selling Church influence.\r\n\r\nIn taking that step I understood, of course, that it meant the death for\r\nme of any political ambition in Utah. It meant offending my father, who\r\nbesought me not to raise my hand against \"the Lord's anointed,\" but to\r\nleave my enemies \"to God's justice\"--as he had always done with his. It\r\nmeant a breach with many of my friends in the Church who would blindly\r\nresent my criticism of the political apostles as an encouragement to the\r\nenemies of the faith. But the part that I had taken in helping Utah to\r\ngain its statehood made it impossible for me to stand aside, now, and\r\nsee all our pledges broken, all our promises betrayed. I had to offer\r\nmyself as a sacrifice to hierarchical resentment in the hope that my\r\ndestruction might give at least a momentary pause to the reactionaries\r\nin their career.\r\n\r\nIt is needless that I should relate all the incidents of that wild\r\nnight. The theatre was packed with people who joined me for the moment\r\nin a sympathetic protest against the disgrace of Utah. President Lorenzo\r\nSnow, his two councillors and several apostles were present, and I spoke\r\nwithout any reservations on account of personal relationship, my own\r\ncandidacy or the possible effect upon my own affairs. I appealed to the\r\npeople to prevent the sale of Utah's senatorship to McCune by Apostle\r\nGrant and the Church reactionaries; and by turning the light of\r\npublicity upon the methods that were being employed in the legislature,\r\nI made it impossible for the hierarchy to sway enough votes to elect\r\nMcCune. The men who had pledged themselves to the other candidates\r\ncould not be shaken from their support without a national scandal. The\r\nelection settled for the time into a deadlock, in which no candidate\r\ncould obtain enough votes to elect him.\r\n\r\nApostle Heber J. Grant started to write letters that should counteract\r\nthe effect of my speech, but President Snow forbade him to continue the\r\ncontroversy and sent word to me that he had forbidden Grant to continue\r\nit. I did not know why President Snow wished me to feel that he was\r\nfriendly to me, but I was soon to learn.\r\n\r\nThe deadlock in the legislature continued, in spite of all the efforts\r\nof the Church authorities to break it. Our political workers, summoned\r\none by one by messengers from Church headquarters, had gone to\r\ninterviews from which they did not return to us--until I had left only\r\nJudge Ed. F. Colborn (a famous character in Kansas, Colorado and Utah),\r\nand an old friend, Jesse W. Fox. One night, about a week after the\r\nmeeting in the theatre, we three were sitting alone in my rooms, when\r\nthe door opened and someone beckoned to Fox. He went out. Judge Colborn\r\nopened a window to see Fox getting into a carriage with a man from\r\nChurch headquarters--and we knew that our last worker was gone.\r\n\r\nHe returned only to tell me that President Snow wished to see me--that\r\nif I were willing, the President would like to have me call upon him, at\r\nhalf past nine the following evening, in his residence. And I understood\r\nthe significance of such an invitation for such an hour. I had been\r\ntoo often in contact with the power of the Prophets to doubt what was\r\nrequired of me. I was curious merely to know what form the ultimatum\r\nwould take.\r\n\r\nPresident Snow was then living with his youngest wife in a house a few\r\nblocks from the offices of the Presidency. I drove there in a carriage\r\nand ordered the driver to wait for me. President Snow opened the door\r\nto me himself, received me with his usual engaging smile, and ushered\r\nme into a reception room that was shut off, by portieres, from a larger\r\nparlor. There, when he had invited me to be seated, he said, winningly:\r\n\"I was not sure you would come in answer to my message.\"\r\n\r\nI assured him that I had not so far lost my regard for the men with whom\r\nmy father was associated. \"And besides,\" I said, \"if there were no other\r\nreason, it is my place, as the younger of the two, to attend on your\r\nconvenience.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know,\" he replied, \"but that you thought me one of the\r\n'Pharisees' of whom you spoke.\"\r\n\r\nI did not accept this invitation to reply that I did not consider him\r\none of the Pharisees. I explained merely that I had identified the\r\nPharisees in my speech by name and deed and accusation. \"Unless\r\nsomething there said is applicable to you, I have no charge to make\r\nagainst you.\"\r\n\r\nHe excused himself a moment to go to an infant whom we could hear crying\r\nin an inner room; and, when he returned, he had the child in his arms--a\r\nlittle girl, in a night gown. He sat down, petting her, stroking her\r\nhair with his supple lean hand, affectionately, and smiling with a sort\r\nof absentminded tenderness as he took up the conversation again.\r\n\r\nThis memory of him sticks in my mind as one of the most extraordinary\r\npictures of my experience. I knew that I had come there to hear my own\r\nor some other person's political death sentence. I knew that he would\r\nnot have invited me at such an hour, with such secrecy, unless the issue\r\nof our conference was to be something dark and fatal. And in the soft\r\nradiance of the lamp he sat smiling--fragile of build, almost spiritual,\r\nwhite-haired, delicately cultured--soothing the child who played with\r\nhis long silvery beard and blinked sleepily. He inquired whether my\r\ncarriage was waiting for me, and I replied that it was. He asked me to\r\ndismiss it. When I returned to the room, the little girl was resting\r\nquiet, and he excused himself to take her to her cot. I heard him\r\nclosing the doors behind him as he came back. \"We may now talk with\r\nperfect freedom,\" he announced. \"There's no one else in this part of the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down in his chair, composing himself with an air that might have\r\ndistinguished one of the ancient kings. \"I have sent for you to talk\r\nabout the Senatorial situation. May I speak plainly to you?\"\r\n\r\nI replied that he might. He was watching me, under his gray eyebrows,\r\nwith his soft eyes, in which there was a glitter of blackness but none\r\nof the rheum of old age.\r\n\r\n\"It would be most unfortunate,\" he said, \"for us, as a people, if we\r\nfailed to elect a Senator. I've had many business and other anxieties\r\nfor the Church, and I want this question settled. If we act wisely--with\r\nthe power and influence at our command--aid will come to me. I think you\r\nwould not willingly permit our situation to become more difficult.\"\r\n\r\nHe must have seen a change in my expression--a change that indicated\r\nhow well I understood the significance of this guarded introduction.\r\nSuddenly, his manner broke into animation, and holding out both hands\r\nto me, palms up, he said, smiling: \"You must know, Brother Frank, that\r\nI had nothing to do with Mr. McCune's candidacy for the Senate, do you\r\nnot? I was not responsible for what Brother Grant did. Before we go on,\r\nI want you to acquit me of responsibility for that project.\"\r\n\r\n\"President Snow,\" I replied, \"I can't admit so much. I, too, wish to\r\ntalk plainly--with your permission. Your responsibility is evident even\r\nto the casual observer--to say nothing of one reared as I've been.\r\nEvery man in this community knows that when you point your finger your\r\napostles go, and when you crook your finger your apostles return--and\r\nHeber J. Grant has only done what you permitted him to do with your full\r\nknowledge.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew himself up, coldly. \"What I have done,\" he retorted, \"has been\r\ndone with the knowledge of my Councillor's.\"\r\n\r\nThe thrust was obvious. I replied: \"If my father desires to discuss with\r\nme his responsibility for this indignity to the state, he knows I'm at\r\nhis command. And if I have any charge to make, involving his good faith\r\ntoward the country, I'll seek him alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he said, with a frigid suavity. \"We will leave that part of\r\nthe question.\" He paused. \"Last night,\" he continued, \"lying on my bed,\r\nI had a vision. I saw this work of God injured by the political strife\r\nof the brethren. And the voice of the Lord came to me, directing me to\r\nsee that your father was elected to the Senate.\" He studied me a moment\r\nbefore he added: \"What have you to say?\"\r\n\r\nI answered: \"It seems to me impossible. This legislature is strongly\r\nDemocratic. My father's a Republican. It seems to me not only\r\nimpracticable but very unwise--if it could be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that,\" he said. \"The Lord will take care of the event.\r\nI want you to withdraw from the race and throw your strength to your\r\nfather. It is the will of the Lord that you do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you a revelation to that effect also?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe answered, pontifically, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll publish it to the world, then, the same as other revelations?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied. \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll not obey it,\" I said, \"because if God is ashamed of it, I\r\nam.\"\r\n\r\nHis air of prophetic authority changed to one of combative resolution.\r\nHe explained that one of the other candidates, a strong Democrat, had\r\nagreed to accept the revelation if I would; that the two of us could\r\ngive our strength to the church candidate; that the Church would turn\r\nto my father the votes that it had already in command for McCune, and my\r\nfather's election would be carried.\r\n\r\nI felt that the thumb-screws were being put on me again. For the second\r\ntime I was being forced to the point of denying the Senatorship to my\r\nfather by refusing him my support. And there could not have been, for\r\nme, a more vivid and instantaneous illumination of the hidden depths in\r\nthis Church system--or in the individual Prophet of the cult--than was\r\nmade by Snow's determined insistence that I should break my word of\r\nhonor to the people of the state and of the nation, pledge that broken\r\nfaith to him, induce all my supporters in the legislature to violate\r\ntheir covenants--Mormon and Gentile alike!--and upon his mere assumption\r\nof divine authority, direct Mormon and Gentile to stultify and disgrace\r\nthemselves forever as men and public officials. There was something\r\nappalling in the calculating cruelty with which he proposed to devote us\r\nall to destruction and dishonor. There was something inhumanly malignant\r\nin the plan to use my known affection for my father in order to make\r\nme guilty of the very betrayal of the people which I had publicly\r\ndenounced. I looked at him--and heard him, now, placidly, confidently,\r\nwith a renewed suavity, urging me to do the thing.\r\n\r\n\"President Snow,\" I interrupted, \"does my father know of this?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered: \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad of it,\" I said. (And I was!) \"This is not the way to work out\r\neither the destiny of 'God's people' or the destiny of this state. It\r\nwould place my father in a most humiliating position to be elected--at\r\nthe orders of the Church--under the assumption that God Almighty had\r\ndirected men to break their solemn promises to their constituents. I\r\nhave as high an admiration for my father's wisdom and ability as you or\r\nthe Democratic candidate who has offered to withdraw at the will of the\r\nChurch, but I should be paying no honor to my father by dishonoring my\r\npledge to my constituents and asking other men to dishonor theirs.\"\r\n\r\nHe dismissed me with an air of benignant sorrow!\r\n\r\nThe deadlock in the legislature continued unbroken. Among my supporters\r\nwas Lewis W. Shurtliff, the President of the \"Stake of Zion\" in which I\r\nlived; he was one of the highest Church dignitaries in the legislature\r\nand was regarded as my foremost champion in the Senatorial contest.\r\nOn the last day of the legislative session, at President Snow's\r\ninstruction, my father, known as a Republican, was offered as a\r\nsenatorial candidate to this Democratic legislature, and all the power\r\nof the Church influence was thrown to him. President Shurtliff's wife\r\ncame to our headquarters, that night, and knelt, with a number of other\r\nladies, to pray that her husband might be spared the humiliation of\r\nbreaking his repeated promise not to desert me! We all knew that if he\r\nbroke his promise, it would cause him more mental anguish than\r\nanyone else; but we knew, too, that if the command came from Church\r\nheadquarters, he would have to obey it. Men broke their political\r\npledges to their people and outraged their own feelings of personal\r\nindependence or partisan loyalty, rather than offend against \"the will\r\nof the Lord.\" The forces of the other candidates went to pieces, and on\r\nthe last night of the session my father's vote reached twenty-three. (It\r\nrequired thirty-two votes to elect.)\r\n\r\nThe situation was saved by the action of a number of Democrats who\r\ngot together and obtained a recess; when the recess was ended, a final\r\nballot was taken, and, since no candidate had enough votes to elect him,\r\nthe presiding officer, by pre-concertment, declared the joint assembly\r\nadjourned sine die, by operation of law. No Senator was elected.\r\n\r\nBut it was the last time that the Church authorities were to be balked.\r\nSince that day, they have dictated the nominations and carried the\r\nelections of the United States Senators from Utah as if these were\r\ncandidates for a church office. The present Senator, Reed Smoot, is an\r\napostle of the Church; he obtained the Mormon President's \"permission\"\r\nto become a candidate, as he admitted to an investigating committee\r\nof the Senate; and when the recent tariff bill was being attacked by\r\ninsurgent Republicans and carried by Senator Aldrich, Senator Smoot\r\nacted as Aldrich's lieutenant in debate, and remained to watch the\r\ndefense of the \"interests\" when his chief was absent from the Senate\r\nchamber. (Not because Smoot was such an able defender of those\r\n\"interests\"! Not because his constituents would uphold his course! But\r\nbecause he has no constituents, and is responsible to no one but the\r\nhierarchical partners of those \"interests.\")\r\n\r\nEvery pledge of the Mormon leaders that the Church would not interfere\r\nin politics has been broken at every election in Utah since President\r\nSnow that night pleaded to me that he had had many business anxieties\r\nfor the Church and that if we elected the Church candidate \"aid\" would\r\ncome to him. The covenants by which Utah obtained its statehood have\r\nbeen violated again and again. The provisions of the state constitution\r\nhave been nullified. The trust of the Mormon people has been abused;\r\ntheir political liberties have been denied them; their Gentile brethren\r\nhave been betrayed. And all this has been done not for the protection\r\nof the people, who were threatened with no proscription--and not for\r\nthe advancement of the faith, which has been free to work out its\r\nown future. It has been done as a part of the alliance between the\r\n\"financial\" prophets of the Church and the financial \"interests\" of\r\nthe country--which have been exploiting the people of Utah as they\r\nhave exploited the whole nation with the aid of the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities in Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI. The Will of the Lord\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mormon leaders were now hurried down their chosen path of dishonor\r\nwith a fateful rapidity. A reform movement was demanding of Washington\r\nthe adoption of a constitutional amendment that should give Congress\r\npower to regulate the marriage and divorce laws of all the states in the\r\nUnion. And this proposed amendment--partly inspired by a growing\r\ndoubt of the good faith of the Mormon leaders--gave the politicians\r\nin Washington something to trade for Mormon votes, in the presidential\r\ncampaign of 1900.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans had lost the electoral votes of Utah and the surrounding\r\nstates, in 1896.\r\n\r\nUtah was now Democratic, and its one United States Senator (who was\r\nstill in office) was a Democrat. Senator Hanna's lieutenant, Perry S.\r\nHeath, came to Salt Lake City in the summer of 1900, to confer with\r\nthe heads of the Mormon Church. His authority (as representative of the\r\nruler of the Republican party) had been authenticated by correspondence;\r\nand he was received by President Snow as royalty receives the envoy of\r\nroyalty.\r\n\r\nHeath negotiated with his usual directness. In the phrase of the time,\r\n\"he laid down his cards on the table, face up, and asked Snow to play\r\nto that hand.\" If the Mormon Church would pledge its support to the\r\nRepublican party, the Republican leaders would avert the threatened\r\nconstitutional amendment that was to give Congress the power to\r\ninterfere in the domestic affairs of the Mormon people. But if the\r\nChurch denied its support to the Republican party, the constitutional\r\namendment would be carried, and the Mormons, in their marriage\r\nrelations, would be returned to the Federal jurisdiction from which they\r\nhad escaped when the territory was admitted to statehood.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of the country was known to be in favor of giving Congress\r\nsuch power. A strong body of reformers was urging the amendment, and\r\nthe Church leaders had sent Apostle John Henry Smith and Bishop H. B.\r\nClawson to lobby against it. After consulting with my father, I had\r\nwritten to President Snow pointing out the danger to the Mormons of\r\nhaving a lobby opposing such an amendment--for I was not then aware of\r\nthe secret return to the practice of polygamy, after 1896. President\r\nSnow replied to me (in a message of guarded prudence) that although\r\nthe Church inhibited plural marriage and did not intend to allow the\r\npractice, he was opposed to the interference of Congress in the domestic\r\nconcerns of the other states of the Union!\r\n\r\nHe made his \"deal\" with Perry Heath. Church messengers were sent out\r\nsecretly to the Mormons in Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, Montana,\r\nWashington, Oregon, California and the territories, with the whispered\r\nannouncement that it was \"the will of the Lord\" that the Republicans\r\nshould be aided. Utah went Republican; the Mormons in the surrounding\r\nstates either openly supported, or secretly voted for McKinley; and the\r\nconstitutional amendment was \"side tracked\" and forgotten.\r\n\r\nUtah elected a Republican legislature. Apostle Reed Smoot applied to\r\nPresident Snow for permission to become a candidate for the United\r\nStates Senatorship, and obtained a promise that if he stood aside, for\r\nthe time, he should receive his reward later. President Snow had decided\r\nthat Thomas Kearns, already an active candidate, was the man whom the\r\nChurch would support--since Mr. Kearns' ability, his wealth and his\r\nbusiness connection promised greater advantages for the state and (under\r\ncunning manipulation by the priests) greater advantages for the Church\r\nthan the election of any other candidate. And all this may be fairly\r\nsaid without assuming that there was any definite arrangement between he\r\nChurch and any friends of Mr. Kearns.\r\n\r\nKearns was associated with Senator Clark of Montana and R. C. Kerens of\r\nSt. Louis in building a railroad from Salt Lake to Los Angeles, and the\r\nChurch owned some fifteen miles of track that had been laid from Salt\r\nLake City, as the beginning of a Los Angeles line. It was apparently\r\nassumed by President Snow that Kearns' election to the Senate would\r\nfacilitate the sale of this Church railroad to the Clark-Kearns\r\nsyndicate. The Church had a direct interest in numerous iron and coal\r\nproperties in Southern Utah, and many members of the Church also had\r\nprivate properties there, which the Los Angeles line would develop.\r\nSome of Kearns' friends were negotiating for the purchase of Church\r\nproperties, and one of his partners was proposing to buy (and\r\nsubsequently bought) the Church's \"Amelia Palace,\" a useless and\r\nexpensive property which Brigham Young had built for his favorite wife,\r\nand which the Church had long been eager to sell.\r\n\r\nMy father had been in ill-health for some months and he was away from\r\nUtah a large part of the time. President Snow took counsel of his Second\r\nCouncillor, Joseph F. Smith, and of Apostle John Henry Smith; and to\r\nthe Smiths, he indicated Thos. Kearns as the one whose election to the\r\nUnited States Senate might do most to advance Snow's concealed purpose.\r\nBut the Smiths had other plans, that were equally advantageous to\r\nthe Church and more advantageous to the Smiths; they rebelled against\r\nPresident Snow's dictation, and he ordered them both away on temporary\r\n\"missions.\"\r\n\r\nAs Joseph F. Smith was leaving the President's offices, in a rage, he\r\nmet an old friend, Joseph Howell, who (at this writing) is a member of\r\nCongress from Utah, and was then a member of the Utah legislature. He\r\ntold Smith that President Snow had sent for him, and Smith, controlling\r\nhimself--without betraying any knowledge of the probable purpose of\r\nSnow's summons to Howell--said affectionately: \"Brother Howell, I want\r\nyou to make a promise to me on your honor as an elder in Israel. I want\r\nyou to pledge yourself never to vote in this legislature for Thomas\r\nKearns as Senator. I ask it as your friend, and as a Prophet to the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nHowell gave his promise, and proceeded to his interview with President\r\nSnow. There he received the announcement that it was \"the will of the\r\nLord\" that he should vote for Kearns, and he had to reply that he had\r\nalready received an inspired instruction, on this point, from a Prophet\r\nof the Lord, and had given his pledge against Kearns.\r\n\r\nThe incident became one of the jokes of the campaign, for Howell held to\r\nhis promise to Smith (and was subsequently rewarded by Smith with a seat\r\nin Congress), and President Snow was compelled to waive the question of\r\nconflicting \"revelations.\"\r\n\r\nKearns was elected. But he had had a powerful political machine of his\r\nown, and he had been supported by a strong Gentile vote. He immediately\r\nshowed his independence by refusing to take orders from the political\r\nChurch leaders. He declined, further, for himself and his financial\r\nconfreres, to engage with the Church in business affairs. Many charges\r\nwere made that he was breaking his agreement of cooperation with the\r\nauthorities, but there never has been produced any evidence of such an\r\nagreement, and I do not believe (from my knowledge of Senator Kearns)\r\nthat the agreement was ever made.\r\n\r\nThe railroad into Southern Utah was later built by the Harriman\r\ninterests in combination with Clark and Kearns; but there, too, Snow was\r\ndisappointed. The expected development of the Church properties proved\r\nfar less profitable than had been supposed, and the financial prophecies\r\nof the Seer and Revelator were not fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was abundantly evident that some of the Church leaders\r\nintended to rule their people in politics with an absolutism as supreme\r\nas any that Utah had ever known in the old days. And for these leaders\r\nto maintain their authority--despite the covenant of their amnesty, the\r\nterms of Utah's statehood and the provisions of the constitution--and to\r\nmaintain that authority against the robust American sentiment that would\r\nbe sure to assert itself--it was necessary that they should have the\r\nmost effective political protection afforded by any organization in the\r\nwhole country. The ideal arrangement of evil was offered to them by the\r\nmen then in temporary leadership of the Republican party. The Prophets\r\nwere able to make the Republican party a guilty partner of their perfidy\r\nby making it a recipient of the proceeds of that perfidy, and to assure\r\nthemselves protection in every religious tyranny so long as they did not\r\nrun counter to Republican purpose.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, the Church took more benefit from the partnership than\r\nit conferred. The result of the presidential elections of 1900 showed\r\nthat the Republicans could have elected their ticket without any help\r\nfrom the Prophets. But without the help of the dominant party the\r\nProphets could not have renewed the rule of the state by the Church\r\ncould not have prevented the passage of a constitutional amendment\r\npunishing polygamy by Federal statute--and could not have obtained such\r\nintimate relation and commanding influence with the great \"interests\" of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThroughout all these miserable incidents, I had a vague hope that\r\nthey would prove merely temporary and peculiar to the term of Snow's\r\npresidency. He was now in his eighty-sixth year. My father was next in\r\nsuccession for the Presidency, and he was seventy-three. He had remained\r\npersonally faithful to every pledge that he had made to the nation, and\r\nthough he had been powerless to prevent the breaches of covenant that\r\nhad followed the sovereignty of statehood, I knew that he had opposed\r\nsome of them and been a willing party to none. It is true that he had\r\nbecome a director of the Union Pacific Railway and was close to the\r\nleading financiers of the East; but his Union Pacific connection had\r\ncome from the fact that he had been one of the builders of the road\r\nthat had afterward merged in the Oregon Short Line; and his financial\r\nrelations had been those of a financier and not a politician. In all the\r\nyears that I had been working with him, I had never known him to have\r\nany purpose that was not communistic in its final aspect and designed\r\nfor the good of his people.\r\n\r\nUp to his seventieth year, he had shown no ill result of his early\r\nhardships. Living the abstemious life of the orthodox Mormon, to whom\r\nwine, tobacco and even tea and coffee are prohibited, he had seemed\r\ninexhaustibly robust and untiring. But almost from the day of\r\nPresident's Snow accession to office--deprived of the sustaining\r\nconsciousness of the responsibilities of leadership--his physical\r\nstrength gave signs of breaking. In the fall of 1900 he made a trip\r\nto the Sandwich Islands, to recuperate, and to assist at the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Mormon mission that he had founded there; but the\r\nUtah winter proved too rigorous for him on his return, and in March,\r\n1901, he was taken to California--to Monterey. In April the word came to\r\nme in New York that he was sinking.\r\n\r\nI found him in a cottage overlooking the beautiful Bay of Monterey and\r\nits wooded slope; and the doctors in attendance told me that he had been\r\nkept alive only by the determination to see me before he died. There\r\nwas no hope. He had still a clear mind, but with ominous lapses of\r\nunconsciousness that foreboded the end; and in these intervals of coma,\r\nas we wheeled him to and fro on the veranda in an invalid chair--in an\r\nattempt to refresh him with the motion of the sea air--he would swing\r\nhis right hand upward, with an old pulpit gesture, and say \"Priesthood!\r\nPriesthood!\" as if in that word he expressed the ruling thought of his\r\nlife, the inspiration that had sustained his power, the obligation that\r\nhad governed him in his direction of his people.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 11th of April, he was lying in a stupor on a\r\ncouch before an open window, with the sound of the surf in the quiet\r\nroom. One of the doctors entered, looked at him intently, and said\r\nto me: \"I can do nothing more here--and my patients need me in\r\nSan Francisco. He can't last long. He'll probably never recover\r\nconsciousness. If there's anything imperative--anything you must say to\r\nhim--any word you wish to have from him--you could perhaps rouse him\"--I\r\nsaid \"No.\" We had never intruded upon any mood of his silence during his\r\nmasterful life; and I felt a jealous rebellion against the idea that we\r\nshould intrude now upon this last, helpless silence of unconsciousness.\r\nThe doctor left us. I summoned the other members of the family from\r\nthe veranda to the bedside. He lay motionless and placid, scarcely\r\nbreathing, his eyes closed, his hands folded. In accordance with the\r\nrites of the Church, we laid our hands on his head, while my eldest\r\nbrother said the prayer of filial blessing that \"sealed\" the dying man\r\nto eternity.\r\n\r\nIn the silence that followed the last \"Amen\" of the prayer, he opened\r\nhis eyes, and said in a steady, strong voice: \"You thought I was passing\r\naway?\"\r\n\r\nWe replied that we had seen he was very weak.\r\n\r\nWith a glance at the door through which the physician had departed, he\r\nsaid resolutely: \"I shall go when my Father calls me--and not till then.\r\nI shall know the moment, and I will not struggle against His command.\r\nLift me up. Carry me out on the balcony I want to see the water once\r\nmore. And I want to talk with you.\"\r\n\r\nTo me, it was the last struggle of the unconquerable will that had\r\nsilently, composedly, cheerfully fought and overcome every obstacle that\r\nhad opposed the purposes of his manhood for half a century. He would\r\nnot yield even to death at the dictation of man. He would go when he was\r\nready--when his mind had accepted the inevitable as the decree of God.\r\n\r\nWe sat around his couch on the veranda, and for two hours he talked to\r\nus as clearly and as forcibly as ever. He spoke of the Church and of its\r\nmission in the world, with all the hope of a religious altruist. From\r\nthe humblest beginnings, it had grown to the greatest power. From the\r\ndepths of persecution, it had risen to win favor from the wisest among\r\nmen. It had abolished poverty for hundreds of thousands, by its sound\r\ncommunal system. In its religious solidarity, it had become a guardian\r\nand administrator of equal justice within all the sphere of its\r\ninfluence. It was full of the most splendid possibilities of good for\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nWith his eyes fixed on the sea--facing eternity as calmly as he faced\r\nthat great symbol of eternity--he voiced the sincerity of his life\r\nand the hope that had animated his statesmanship. In an exaltation of\r\nspirituality that made the moment one of the sublime experiences of my\r\nlife, he adjured us all to hold true to our covenants. I do not write of\r\nhis personal words of love and admonition to the members of his family.\r\nI wish to express only the aspects that may be of public interest,\r\nin his last aspirations--for these were the aspirations of the Mormon\r\nleaders of the older generation, whom he represented--and they are the\r\naspirations of all the wise among the Mormons today, whatever may be the\r\nfolly and the treachery of their Prophets.\r\n\r\nTen hours later, he was dead.\r\n\r\nI cannot pretend that I had any true apprehension, then, of what his\r\nloss meant to the community. I had no clearer vision of events than\r\nothers. I felt that I had no longer any tie to connect me closely with\r\nthe government of the Church, and I was willing to stand aside from its\r\naffairs, believing that the momentum of progress imparted to it would\r\ncarry it forward. The nation had cleared the path for it. Its faith, put\r\ninto practice as a social gospel, had been freed of the offensive\r\nthings that had antagonized the world. My father's last messages of hope\r\nremained with me as a cheering prophecy.\r\n\r\nAt his funeral in the great tabernacle, President Snow put forward\r\na favorite son, Leroy, to read an official statement in which the\r\nPresident took occasion to deny that my father had dictated the recent\r\npolicies of the Church: those policies, he said, had been solely the\r\nPresident's. (He is welcome to the credit of them!) Joseph F. Smith\r\nshowed more generosity of emotion, now that his path of succession\r\nwas clear of the superior in authority whom he had so long regarded\r\nenviously; and he spoke of my father, both privately and in public, in a\r\nway that won me to him.\r\n\r\nThe shock of grief had perhaps \"mellowed\" me. I felt more tolerant of\r\nthese men, since I was no longer necessarily engaged in opposing them.\r\nWhen President Snow died (October, 1901), I shared only the general\r\ninterest in the way Joseph F. Smith set about asserting his family's\r\ntitle to rulership of the \"Kingdom of God on Earth;\" for, in effect,\r\nhe notified the world that his branch of the Smith family had been\r\ndesignated by Divine revelation to rule in the affairs of all men, by an\r\nappointment that had never been revoked. He has since made his cousin,\r\nJohn Henry Smith, his First Councillor; and he has inducted his son\r\nHyrum into the apostolate by \"revelation.\" This latter act roused the\r\njealousy of the mother of his son Joseph F. Smith, Jr., and the amused\r\ngossip of the Mormons predicted another revelation that should give\r\nJoseph Jr. a similar promotion. The revelation came. So many others have\r\nalso come that the Smith family is today represented in the hierarchy\r\nby Joseph F. Smith, President, \"Prophet, Seer and Revelator to all the\r\nworld;\" John Smith (a brother) presiding Patriarch over the whole human\r\nrace; John Henry Smith (a cousin) Apostle and First Councillor to the\r\nPresident; Hyrum Smith and Joseph F. Smith (sons) Apostles; George A.\r\nSmith (son of John Henry) apostle; David S. Smith (son of Joseph\r\nF.) Councillor to the presiding Bishop of the Church and in line of\r\nsuccession to the bishopric; and Bathseba W. Smith, President of the\r\nRelief Societies[4]. [FOOTNOTE: She has died since this was written.]\r\n\r\nAs Joseph F. Smith has still thirty other sons--and at least four wives\r\nwho are not represented in the apostolate--there may yet be a quorum of\r\nSmiths to succeed endlessly to the Presidency and make the Smith family\r\na perpetual dynasty in Utah.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the fascinating contradictions of Mormonism that many of\r\nthe sincere people--who smilingly predicted the Divine interposition by\r\nwhich this family succession was founded--accept its rule devoutly. \"The\r\nLord,\" they will tell you, \"will look after the Church. If these men are\r\ngood enough for God, they are good enough for me. I do not have to save\r\nthe Kingdom.\" And they continue paying their devotion (and their tithes)\r\nto a family autocracy whose imposition would have provoked a rebellion\r\nin any other community in the civilized world!\r\n\r\nIt is \"the will of the Lord!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII. The Conspiracy Completed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Smiths were no sooner firm in power than rumors began to circulate\r\nof a recrudescence of plural marriage, and I heard reports of political\r\nplots by which the Prophets were to reestablish their autocracy in\r\nworldly affairs in the name of God. I sought to close my mind against\r\nsuch accusations, for I remembered how often my father had been\r\nmisjudged, and I felt that nothing but the most direct evidence should\r\nbe permitted to convince me of a recession by the Church authorities\r\nfrom the miraculous opportunity of progress that was now open to their\r\nleadership. Such direct evidence came, in part, in the state elections\r\nof 1902.\r\n\r\nThe Utah Democrats re-nominated Wm. H. King for Congress; Senator Joseph\r\nL. Rawlins was their candidate to succeed himself in the United States\r\nSenate. The Republicans nominated President Smith's friend, Joseph\r\nHowell, for Congress; and there began to spread a rumor that Apostle\r\nReed Smoot was to become a Republican candidate for the Senatorship\r\nunder an old promise given him by President Snow and now endorsed by\r\nPresident Smith. I had been made state chairman of the Democratic party;\r\nand with the growing report of Apostle Smoot's candidacy, I observed a\r\ngradual cessation of political activity on the part of those prominent\r\nDemocrats who were close to the Church leaders.\r\n\r\nNow, our party was not making war on the Church nor on any of its proper\r\nmissions in the world. Our candidates were capable and popular men\r\nagainst whom no just ecclesiastical antagonism could be raised. We were\r\nasking no favors from the Church. And we were determined to have no\r\nopposition from the Church without a protest and an understanding.\r\n\r\nFor this reason--after consulting confidentially with the leaders of our\r\nparty--undertook to make a personal visit to President Smith's office\r\nto demand that the Church authorities should keep their hands out of\r\npolitics. But even while I discussed the matter with our party leaders,\r\nI was afraid that some of them might betray our concerted purpose to\r\nChurch headquarters. And my fear was well grounded. When I went to the\r\noffices of the Presidency, the authorities--for the first, last and only\r\ntime--refused to see me; and the secretary betrayed a knowledge of my\r\nmission by telling me that I should hear from some one of the hierarchy,\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days afterward, Apostle M. F. Cowley came to me with word\r\nthat my call had been considered and that he had been deputed to talk\r\nwith me. We appointed a time for conference in my rooms at Democratic\r\nheadquarters, where we spent the large part of a day in consultation.\r\nAnd since the argument between us covered the whole ground of Apostle\r\nSmoot's candidacy, I wish to give an account of that interview, as a\r\nbrief exposition of some of the present-day aspects of the Church's\r\ninterference in politics.\r\n\r\nApostle Cowley and I had been boyhood friends. He had been one of the\r\nolder students at the school that I had attended as a child; and I knew\r\nthe integrity and directness of his character. He was a stocky, strong\r\nman, with a wholesome sort of face, brown with the sunburn of his\r\nmissionary travels in Canada and in Mexico. (He had been, in fact,\r\nsolemnizing plural marriages in these polygamous refuges--as we found\r\nout later.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was clearly understood between us that I represented the\r\nDemocratic state committee and he represented the Church authorities, I\r\nasked for an explanation of Apostle Smoot's candidacy.\r\n\r\nCowley began by admitting the candidacy, which President Smith had\r\nendorsed (he said) in spite of the opposition of some of the apostles.\r\nHe argued that Apostle Smoot was only exercising his right of American\r\ncitizenship in aspiring to the Senatorship; and he explained that the\r\nChurch authorities did not see why the Church should be drawn into the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nBut, as I pointed out to him, the Church had already drawn itself in.\r\nIt had held a solemn conclave of its hierarchy to authorize an apostle's\r\ncandidacy. The opponents of Church rule would circulate the fact; in\r\nany close campaign, the apostle's friends would use the fact upon the\r\nfaithful; and the Church would be compelled to support its apostle in an\r\nassumed necessity of defending itself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I was objectionably forceful in my reply to him. With his\r\ncharacteristic gentleness, he rebuked me by recalling that President\r\nWoodruff had once taken him into \"sacred places,\" assured him that\r\n\"Frank Cannon, like David, was a man after God's own heart,\" and asked\r\nhim to \"labor\" for me in politics. If it had been right for the Prophet\r\nof God to favor me, why was it not right for the Prophet now to favor\r\nsome one else?\r\n\r\nMy personal regard for Apostle Cowley kept me from showing the amusement\r\nI felt at finding myself in this new scriptural role remembering how\r\nPresident Woodruff had once devoted me to destruction like another Isaac\r\non the altar of Church control. I replied to Cowley, as soberly as\r\nI could, that I had never consciously received the aid of any Church\r\ninfluence; that I had always objected to its use, either for or against\r\neither party; that I could oppose it now with free hands.\r\n\r\nHe retreated upon the favorite argument of the ecclesiasts: that an\r\napostle did not relinquish his citizenship because of his Church rank;\r\nthat the very political freedom which we demanded, to be effective, must\r\napply to all men, in or out of the Church. He asked naively: \"What did\r\nwe get statehood for--and amnesty--and our political rights--if we're\r\nnot to enjoy them?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to that was obvious: The Mormon Church is so constructed\r\nthat the apostle carries with him the power of the Church wherever he\r\nappears. The whole people recognize in him the personified authority of\r\nthe Church; and if an apostle were allowed to make a political campaign\r\nwithout a denunciation from the other Church authorities, it would be\r\nknown that he had been selected for political office by \"the mouthpiece\r\nof the Almighty.\" I cited the case of Apostle Moses Thatcher as proof\r\nthat the Church did exercise power openly to negative an apostle's\r\nambition. If it failed now to rebuke Smoot, this very failure would be\r\nan affirmative use of its power in his behalf; all Mormons who did not\r\nwish to raise their hands \"against the Lord's anointed,\" would have\r\nto support Smoot's legislative ticket, regardless of their political\r\nconvictions; and all Gentiles and independent Mormons would have to\r\nfight the intrusion of the Church into open political activities.\r\n\r\nCowley replied that \"the brethren\"--meaning the hierarchy--believed that\r\na Mormon should have as many political rights, as a Catholic; and he\r\nasked me if I would object to seeing a Catholic in the Senate.\r\n\r\nOf course not. There are, and have been, many such. \"But suppose,\" I\r\nargued, \"that the Pope were to select one of his Italian cardinals to\r\ncome to this country and be naturalized in some state of this Union that\r\nwas under the sole rule of the Roman Catholic Church; and suppose that\r\nstill holding his princedom in the Catholic Church and exercising the\r\nplenary authority conferred on him by the Pope--suppose he were to\r\nappear before the Senate in his robes of office, with his credentials\r\nas a Senator from his Church-ruled state--all of this being a matter of\r\npublic knowledge--do you think the Senate would seat him? Certainly\r\nnot. Yet the cases are exactly analogous. We were but lately alien and\r\nproscribed. We were admitted into the Union on a covenant that forbade\r\nChurch interference in politics. It is the whole teaching of the Church\r\nthat a Prophet wears his prophetic authority constantly as a robe of\r\noffice. The case of Moses Thatcher is proof to the world that the Church\r\nappoints and disappoints at its pleasure. I don't believe that Smoot, if\r\nelected, will be allowed to hold his seat, and--if he is allowed to hold\r\nit--a greater trouble than his exclusion will surely follow. For, with\r\nthe princes of the Mormon Church holding high place in the national\r\ncouncils--and using the power of the Church to maintain themselves\r\nthere--we are assuring for ourselves an indefinite future of the most\r\nbitter controversy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Cowley had no more arguments to offer, he said: \"Well, the Prophet\r\nhas spoken. That's enough for me. I submit cheerfully when the will of\r\nthe Lord comes to me through his appointed servants. The matter has\r\nbeen decided, and it does not lie in your power--or anyone else's--to\r\nwithstand the purposes of the Almighty.\" He rose and put his hand on my\r\nshoulder, affectionately. \"Your father is gone, Frank. I loved him very\r\ndearly. I hope that you are not going to be found warring against the\r\nLord's anointed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mat,\" I replied, \"you have already pointed out that Apostle Smoot\r\nappears in politics only as an American citizen. For the purposes of\r\nthis fight--and to avoid the consequences that you fear I'll regard him\r\nas a politician merely, and fight him as such.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, you know, Frank,\" he remonstrated, \"he has been consecrated to the\r\napostleship, and I'm afraid that you'll overstep the bounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mat,\" I assured him, \"I'll watch carefully, and unless he makes his\r\nlightning changes too fast, I'll aim my shots only when he's in his\r\npolitical clothes. If the change is too indefinite, blame yourselves\r\nand not us. The whole teaching of the Church is that an apostle must be\r\nregarded as an apostle at all times; but the whole teaching of politics\r\nis that all men should appear upon equal terms--in this country. That's\r\nwhy we insist that no apostle should become a candidate for public\r\noffice.\"\r\n\r\nCowley took his departure with evident relief. He had discharged\r\nhis ambassadorial duty--and given me the warning which he had been\r\nauthorized to deliver--without a rupture of our personal friendship. And\r\nI saw him go, for my part, in a sorrowful certainty that the Church had\r\nthrown off all disguise and proposed to show the world, by the election\r\nof an apostle to the United States Senate, that the \"Kingdom of God\" was\r\nestablished in Utah to rule in all the affairs of men. I knew that if\r\nSmoot were excluded from the Senate, his exclusion would be argued\r\na proof that the wicked and unregenerate nation was still devilishly\r\npersecuting God's anointed servants, to its own destruction; and, if he\r\nwere permitted to take his seat, that this fact would be cited to the\r\nfaithful as proof that the Prophets had been called to save the nation\r\nfrom the destruction that threatened it!\r\n\r\nOf course, throughout the campaign that followed, the Church's\r\nnewspapers and many of its political workers kept protesting publicly\r\nthat the election of the Republican legislative ticket did not mean\r\nthe election of Apostle Smoot to the Senate. But by means of the\r\nauthoritative whisper of ecclesiasts--carried by visiting apostles to\r\nPresidents of Stakes, from them to the bishops, and from the bishops to\r\nthe presiding officers of subsidiary organizations--the inspired order\r\nwas given to the faithful that they must vote for the legislators who\r\ncould be relied upon to do the will of the Lord by voting for the Lord's\r\nanointed prophet, Apostle Reed Smoot. This message was delivered to the\r\nsacred Sunday prayer circles. Even Senator Rawlins' mother received it,\r\nfrom one of the ecclesiastical authorities of her ward, who instructed\r\nher to vote against the election of her own son; and it was \"at the\r\nperil of her immortal soul\" that she disobeyed the injunction. Long\r\nbefore election day, every Mormon knew that he had been called upon\r\nby the Almighty to sacrifice his individual conviction in politics to\r\nprotect his \"assailed Church.\"\r\n\r\nThe profound effectiveness of that appeal needs no further proof than\r\nthe issue of the election. King and Rawlins, the popular leaders of\r\nthe Democracy in a state that had but recently been overwhelmingly\r\nDemocratic--after a campaign in which they studiously avoided an\r\nattack upon the Church--were overwhelmingly defeated. The Republican\r\nlegislative ticket was carried. Apostle Smoot was elected to the United\r\nStates Senate; and on January 21, 1903, Governor Wells issued to him a\r\ncertificate of election.\r\n\r\nFive days later, a number of prominent citizens signed a protest, to\r\nPresident Roosevelt and the Senate, against allowing Apostle Smoot to\r\ntake his seat. And the grounds of the protest, briefly stated, were\r\nthese: The Mormon priesthood claimed supreme authority in politics,\r\nand such authority was exercised by the first presidency and the twelve\r\napostles, of whom Smoot was one. They had not only not abandoned the\r\npractice of political dictation, but they had not abandoned the belief\r\nin polygamy and polygamous cohabitation; they connived at and encouraged\r\nits practice, sought to pass laws that should nullify the statutes\r\nagainst the practice, and protected and honored the violators of\r\nthose statutes. And they had done all these things despite the public\r\nsentiment of the civilized world, in violation of the pledges given in\r\nprocuring amnesty and in obtaining the return of the escheated Church\r\nproperty, contrary to the promises given by the representatives of the\r\nChurch and of the territory in their plea for statehood, contrary to\r\nthe pledges required by the Enabling Act and given in the State\r\nconstitution, and contrary to the laws of the State itself.\r\n\r\nThese charges were supported by innumerable citations from the published\r\ndoctrines of the Church, and from the published speeches and sermons\r\nof the Prophets. Evidence was offered of the continuance of polygamous\r\ncohabitation (since 1890) by President Smith, all but three or four of\r\nthe apostles, the entire Presidency of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion,\r\nand many others. New polygamy was specifically charged against three\r\napostles, and against the son of a fourth. A second protest, signed by\r\nJohn L. Leilich, repeated these grounds of objection to Apostle Smoot,\r\nand charged further that Apostle Smoot was himself a polygamist; but no\r\nattempt was made to prove this latter charge.\r\n\r\nUpon the filing of the protest, there was a storm of anger at Church\r\nheadquarters; and the ecclesiastical newspapers railed with the\r\nbitterness of anxious apprehension. Throughout Utah it seemed to be the\r\npopular belief that Apostle Smoot would be excluded--on the issue of\r\nwhether a responsible representative of a Church that was protecting and\r\nencouraging law-breaking should be allowed a seat in the highest body of\r\nthe nation's law-makers. But the issue against him was not to be heard\r\nuntil twelve months after his election, and every agent and influence of\r\nthe Church was set to work at once to nullify the effect of the protest.\r\n\r\nEvery financial institution, East or West, to which the Church could\r\nappeal, was solicited to demand a favorable hearing of the Smoot case\r\nfrom the Senators of its state. Every political and business interest\r\nthat could be reached was moved to protect the threatened Apostle. The\r\nsugar trust magnates and their Senators were enlisted. The mercantile\r\ncorrespondents of the Church were urged to write letters to their\r\nCongressmen and to their Senators, and to use their power at home to\r\ncheck the anti-Mormon newspapers. The Utah representative of a powerful\r\nmercantile institution, that had vital business relations with the\r\nChurch, confessed to me that he had been called East to consult with the\r\nhead of his company, who had been asked to use his influence for Smoot.\r\n\"I could not advise our president,\" he said, \"to send the letter that\r\nwas demanded of him. And yet I couldn't take the responsibility of\r\ninjuring the company by advising him to refuse the Church request. You\r\nknow, if we had refused it, point-blank, they would have destroyed every\r\ninterest we had within the domain of their power. I should have been\r\nruined financially. All our stockholders would have suffered. They would\r\nnever have forgiven me.\"\r\n\r\nThe president of the company failed to send the letter. His failure\r\nbecame known, through Church espionage and the report of the Church's\r\nfriends in the Senate. Pressure was brought to bear upon him; and, with\r\nthe aid of his Utah representative, he compromised on a letter that did\r\npartial violence to his conscience and partially endangered his business\r\nrelations with the Church.\r\n\r\nBoth these men were aware that the Church had broken its covenants to\r\nthe country, and that Apostle Smoot could not be either a loyal citizen\r\nof the nation or a free representative of the people of his state.\r\n\"I did not like the compromise we made,\" my friend told me. \"I feel\r\nhumiliated whenever I think of it. But I tried to do the best I could\r\nunder the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of this pressure of political and business interests upon\r\nWashington showed gradually in the tone of the political newspapers\r\nthroughout the whole country. It showed in the growing confidence\r\nexpressed by the organs of the Church authorities in Utah. It showed in\r\nthe cheerful predictions of the Prophets that the Lord would overrule in\r\nApostle Smoot's behalf. It showed in Smoot's exercise of an autocratic\r\nleadership in the political affairs of the State.\r\n\r\nHe was allowed to take his oath of office as Senator on March 5, 1903;\r\nthe protests against him were referred to the Senate Committee on\r\nPrivileges and Elections for a hearing (January 27, 1904); and a contest\r\nbegan that lasted from January, 1904, to February, 1907. During those\r\nyears was completed the business and political conspiracy between\r\nfinancial \"privilege\" and religious absolutism, of which conspiracy this\r\nnarrative has described the beginning and the growth.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to expose the progression of incident by which\r\nthe end of that conspiracy was approached--since it was necessarily\r\napproached in the darkest secrecy. But several indications of the method\r\nand the progress did show, here and there, on the surface of events; and\r\nthese indications are powerfully significant.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1901 it had become known that Apostle Smoot was negotiating\r\na sale, to the sugar trust, of the Church's sugar holdings. On May\r\n13, 1902, the president of the trust reported to the trust's executive\r\ncommittee--\r\n\r\n[FOOTNOTE: See a synopsis of the minutes of the trust's executive\r\ncommittee, published in Hampton's Magazine, in January, 1910.]\r\n\r\nthat he had agreed to buy a one-half interest in the consolidation of\r\nthe Mormon factories of La Grande, Logan and Ogden. (The following day,\r\nMay 14, 1902, is given by Apostle Smoot as the day on which he obtained\r\nPresident Joseph F. Smith's permission to become a candidate for the\r\nSenatorship.) On June 24, 1902 the sugar trust's executive committee\r\nwas informed of the trust's purchase of one-half of the capital stock\r\nof these three Church-owned sugar companies. On July 5, 1902 the three\r\ncompanies were consolidated under the name of the Amalgamated Sugar\r\nCompany, with David Eccles, polygamist, trustee of Church bonds, and\r\nprotege of Joseph F. Smith, as President; and the sugar trust took half\r\nthe stock, in exchange for its holdings in the three original companies.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in this same year, the old Church-owned Utah Sugar Company\r\nincreased its stock in order to buy the Garland sugar factory, and the\r\nsugar trust, it is understood, was concerned in the purchase In 1903,\r\n1904 and 1905, the Idaho Sugar Company, the Freemont Sugar Company,\r\nand West Idaho Sugar Company were incorporated; and in 1906 all these\r\ncompanies were amalgamated in the present Utah-Idaho Sugar Company,\r\nof which Joseph F. Smith is president, T. R. Cutler, a Mormon, is\r\nvice-president, Horace G. Whitney, the general manager of the Church's\r\nDeseret News, is secretary and treasurer, and other Church officials are\r\ndirectors. Of the stock of this company the sugar trust holds fifty-one\r\nper cent. So that between 1902 and 1906 a partnership in the manufacture\r\nof beet sugar was effected between the Church and the trust; and Apostle\r\nSmoot became a Sugar trust Senator, and argued and voted as such.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it was at this same period that the Church sold the\r\nstreet railway of Salt Lake City and its electric power company to the\r\n\"Harriman interests\" under peculiar circumstances--a matter of which I\r\nhave written in an earlier chapter. The Church owners of this Utah Light\r\nand Railway Company, through the Church's control of the City Council,\r\nhad attempted to obtain a hundred-year franchise from the city on terms\r\nthat were outrageously unjust to the citizens; and finally, on June 5,\r\n1905, a franchise was obtained for fifty years, for the company of\r\nwhich Joseph F. Smith was the president. On August 3, 1905, another city\r\nordinance was passed, consolidating all former franchises, then held\r\nby the Utah Light and Power Company, but originally granted to D. F.\r\nWalker, the Salt Lake and Ogden Gas and Electric Light Company, the\r\nPioneer Power Company and the Utah Power Company; and this ordinance\r\nextended the franchises to July 1, 1955. The properties were bonded for\r\n$6,300,000, but it was understood that they were worth not more than\r\n$4,000,000. They were sold to \"the Harriman interests\" for $10,000,000.\r\nThe equipment of the Salt Lake City street railway was worse than\r\nvalueless, and the new company had to remove the rails and discard\r\nthe rolling stock. But the ten millions were well invested in this\r\npublic-utility trust, for the company had a monopoly of the street\r\nrailway service and electric power and gas supply of Salt Lake City; and\r\nits franchises left it free to extort whatever it could from the people\r\nof the whole country side, by virtue of a partnership with the Church\r\nauthorities whereby extortion was given the protection of \"God's\r\nanointed Prophets.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph F. Smith, of course, was already a director of Harriman's Union\r\nPacific Railroad, a position to which he had been elected after his\r\naccession to the First Presidency. And he was so elected not because of\r\nhis railroad holdings--for he came to the Presidency a poor man--and\r\nnot because of his ability or experience as a financier or a railroad\r\nbuilder, for he had not had any such experience and he had not shown\r\nany such ability. He was elected because of the partnership between the\r\nChurch leaders and the Union Pacific Railroad--a partnership that was\r\ndoubtlessly used in defense of Apostle Smoot's seat in the Senate, just\r\nas the power of the Sugar Trust was used and the influence of the whole\r\nfinancial confederation in politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII. The Smoot Exposure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust before the subpoenas were issued in the Smoot investigation, I met\r\nJohn R. Winder (then First Councillor to President Smith) on the street\r\nin Salt Lake City, and he expressed the hope that when I went \"to\r\nWashington on the Smoot case,\" I would not \"betray\" my \"brethren.\" I\r\nassured him that I was not going to Washington as a witness in the Smoot\r\ncase; that the men whom he should warn, were at Church headquarters. He\r\nreplied, with indignant alarm, \"I don't see what 'the brethren' have to\r\ndo with this!\"\r\n\r\nBut when the subpoenas arrived for Smith and the hierarchy, alarm and\r\nindignation assumed a new complexion. The authorities, for themselves,\r\nand through the mouths of such men as Brigham H. Roberts, began to boast\r\nof how they were about to \"carry the gospel to the benighted nation\" and\r\npreach it from the witness stand in Washington. The Mormon communities\r\nresounded with fervent praises to God that He had, through His servant,\r\nApostle Smoot, given the opportunity to His living oracles to speak to\r\nan unrighteous people! And when the Senators decided that they would\r\nnot summon polygamous wives and their children en bloc to Washington to\r\ntestify (because it was not desired to \"make war on women and children\")\r\nsome of Joseph F. Smith's several wives even complained feelingly that\r\nthey \"were not allowed to testify for Papa.\"\r\n\r\nThe first oracular disclosure made by the Prophets, on the witness\r\nstand, came as a shock even to Utah. They testified that they had\r\nresumed polygamous cohabitation to an extent unsuspected by either\r\nGentiles or Mormons. President Joseph F. Smith admitted that he had had\r\neleven children borne to him by his five wives, since pledging\r\nhimself to obey the \"revealed\" manifesto of 1890 forbidding polygamous\r\nrelations. Apostle Francis Marion Lyman, who was next in succession to\r\nthe Presidency, made a similar admission of guilt, though in a lesser\r\ndegree. So did John Henry Smith and Charles W. Penrose, apostles. So did\r\nBrigham H. Roberts and George Reynolds, Presidents of Seventies. So did\r\na score of others among the lesser authorities. And they confessed that\r\nthey were living in polygamy in violation of their pledges to the nation\r\nand the terms of their amnesty, against the laws and the constitution of\r\nthe state, and contrary to the \"revelation of God\" by which the doctrine\r\nof polygamy had been withdrawn from practice in the Church!\r\n\r\nPresident Joseph F. Smith admitted that he was violating the law of the\r\nState. He was asked: \"Is there not a revelation that you shall abide by\r\nthe law of the State and of the land?\" He answered, \"Yes, sir.\" He was\r\nasked: \"And if that is a revelation, are you not violating the laws\r\nof God?\" He answered: \"I have admitted that, Mr. Senator, a great many\r\ntimes here.\"\r\n\r\nApostle Francis Marion Lyman was asked: \"You say that you, an apostle\r\nof your Church, expecting to succeed (if you survive Mr. Smith) to\r\nthe office in which you will be the person to be the medium of Divine\r\nrevelations, are living, and are known to your people to live, in\r\ndisobedience of the law of the land and the law of God?\" Apostle Lyman\r\nanswered: \"Yes, sir.\" The others pleaded guilty to the same charge.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the worst. There had been new polygamous marriages.\r\nBishop Chas. E. Merrill, the son of an apostle, testified that his\r\nfather had married him to a plural wife in 1891, and that he had been\r\nliving with both wives ever since. A Mrs. Clara Kennedy testified that\r\nshe had been married to a polygamist in 1896, in Juarez, Mexico, by\r\nApostle Brigham Young, Jr., in the home of the president of the stake.\r\nThere was testimony to show that Apostle George Teasdale had taken a\r\nplural wife six years after the \"manifesto\" forbidding polygamy, and\r\nthat Benjamin Cluff, Jr., president of the Church university, had\r\ntaken a plural wife in 1899. Some ten other less notorious cases were\r\nexposed--including those of M. W. Merrill, an apostle, and J. M. Tanner,\r\nsuperintendent of Church schools. It was testified that Apostle John W.\r\nTaylor had taken two plural wives within four years, and that Apostle M.\r\nF. Cowley had taken one; and both these men had fled from the country in\r\norder to escape a summons to appear before the Senate committee.\r\n\r\nPresident Joseph F. Smith, in his attempts to justify his own polygamy,\r\ngave some very involved and contradictory testimony. He said that he\r\nadhered to both the divine revelation commanding polygamy and the\r\ndivine revelation \"suspending\" the command. He said he believed that the\r\nprinciple of plural marriage was still as \"correct a principle\" as when\r\nfirst revealed, but that the \"law commanding it\" had been suspended\r\nby President Woodruff's manifesto. He said that he accepted President\r\nWoodruff's manifesto as a revelation from God, but he objected to having\r\nit called \"a law of the Church;\" he insisted that it was only \"a rule\r\nof the Church.\" He admitted that the manifesto forbidding polygamy had\r\nnever been printed among the other revelations in the Church's book of\r\n\"Doctrine and Covenants,\" in which the original revelation commanding\r\npolygamy was still printed without note or qualification of any kind. He\r\nadmitted that this anti-polygamy manifesto was not printed in any of the\r\nother doctrinal works which the Mormon missionaries took with them\r\nwhen they were sent out to preach the Mormon faith. He claimed that the\r\nmanifesto was circulated in pamphlet form, but he subsequently admitted\r\nthat the pamphlet did not \"state in terms\" that the manifesto was a\r\n\"revelation.\" He finally pleaded that the manifesto had been omitted\r\nfrom the book of \"Doctrine and Covenants\" by an \"oversight,\" and he\r\npromised to have it included in the next edition!\r\n\r\n[FOOTNOTE: He did not keep his promise. The manifesto was not added\r\nto the book of revelations until some time later, after considerable\r\nprotest in Utah.]\r\n\r\nIn short, it was shown, by the testimony given and the evidence\r\nintroduced, not only that the Church authorities persisted in living in\r\npolygamy, not only that polygamous marriages were being contracted, but\r\nthat the Church still adhered to the doctrine of polygamy and taught it\r\nas a law of God.\r\n\r\nPresident Joseph F. Smith denied the right of Congress to regulate his\r\n\"private conduct\" as a polygamist. \"It is the law of my state to which\r\nI am amenable,\" he said, \"and if the officers of the law have not\r\ndone their duty toward me I can not blame them. I think they have some\r\nrespect for me.\"\r\n\r\nA mass of testimony showed why the officers of the law did not do their\r\nduty. During the anti-polygamy agitation of 1899 (which ended in the\r\nrefusal of Congress to seat Brigham H. Roberts) a number of prosecutions\r\nof polygamists had been attempted. In many instances the county\r\nattorney had refused to prosecute even upon sworn information. Wherever\r\nprosecutions were had, the fines imposed were nominal; these were in\r\nsome cases never paid, and in other cases paid by popular subscription.\r\nIt was testified that in Box Elder County subscription lists had been\r\ncirculated to collect money for the fines, but that the fines were never\r\npaid, though the subscriptions had been collected. All the prosecutions\r\nhad been dropped, at last. It was pleaded that there was a strong\r\nGentile sentiment against these prosecutions, because of the hope that\r\nno new polygamous marriages were being contracted; but it was shown\r\nalso, that the Church authorities controlled the enforcement of the law\r\nby their influence in the election of the agents of the law.\r\n\r\nThe Church controlled, too, the making of the law. For example,\r\ntestimony was given to show that in 1896 the Church authorities had\r\nappointed a committee of six elders to examine all bills introduced into\r\nthe Utah legislature and decide which were \"proper\" to be passed. In the\r\nneighboring state of Idaho, the legislature, in 1904, unanimously and\r\nwithout discussion passed a resolution for a new state constitution that\r\nshould omit the anti-polygamy test oath clauses objectionable to the\r\nMormons; and in this connection it was testified that the state chairman\r\nof both political parties in Idaho always went to Salt Lake City, before\r\na campaign, to consult with the Church authorities; that every request\r\nof the authorities made to the Idaho political leaders was granted; that\r\nsix of the twenty-one countries in Idaho were \"absolutely controlled\"\r\nby Mormons, and the \"balance of power\" in six counties more was held by\r\nMormons; and that it was \"impossible for any man or party to go against\r\nthe Mormon Church in Idaho.\" Apostle John Henry Smith testified that\r\none-third of the population of Idaho was Mormon and one-fourth of the\r\npopulation of Wyoming, and that there were large settlements in\r\nNevada, Colorado, California, Arizona and the surrounding states and\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nA striking example of the power of the Church as against the power of\r\nthe nation was given to the Senate committee by John Nicholson, chief\r\nrecorder of the temple in Salt Lake City. He had failed to produce some\r\nof the temple marriage records for which the committee had called. He\r\nwas asked whether he would bring the books, on the order of the Senate\r\nof the United States, if the First Presidency of the Church forbade him\r\nto bring them. He answered: \"I would not.\" He was asked: \"And if the\r\nSenate should send the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate and arrest you and\r\norder you to bring them\" (the records) \"with you, you would still refuse\r\nto bring them, unless the First Presidency asked you to?\" He answered,\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nIt was shown that classes of instruction in the Mormon religion had been\r\nforced upon teachers in a number of public schools in Utah by the orders\r\nof the First Presidency. (These orders were withdrawn after the exposure\r\nbefore the committee.) Church control had gone so far in Brigham City,\r\nBox Elder County, Utah, that in a dispute between the City Council and\r\nthe electric lighting company of the city, the local ecclesiastical\r\ncouncil interfered. In the same city, two young men built a dancing\r\npavilion that competed with the Church-owned Opera House; the\r\necclesiastical council \"counselled\" them to remove the pavilion and\r\ndispose of \"the material in its construction;\" they were threatened that\r\nthey would be \"dropped\" if they did not obey this \"counsel;\" and they\r\ncompromised by agreeing to pay twenty-five percent of the net earnings\r\nof their pavilion into the Church's \"stake treasury.\" In Monroe ward,\r\nSevier County, Utah, in 1901, a Mormon woman named Cora Birdsall had a\r\ndispute with a man named James E. Leavitt about a title to land. Leavitt\r\nwent into the bishop's court and got a decision against her. She wrote\r\nto President Joseph F. Smith for permission either to appeal the case\r\ndirect to him or \"to go to law\" in the matter; and Smith advised her\r\n\"to follow the order provided of the Lord to govern in your case.\" The\r\ndispute was taken through the ecclesiastical courts and decided against\r\nher. She refused to deed the land to Leavitt and she was excommunicated\r\nby order of the High Council of the Sevier Stake of Zion. She became\r\ninsane as a result of this punishment, and her mother appealed to the\r\nstake president to grant her some mitigation. He wrote, in reply: \"Her\r\nonly relief will be in complying with President Smith's wishes. You say\r\nshe has never broken a rule of the Church. You forget that she has done\r\nso by failing to abide by the decision of the mouthpiece of God.\" She\r\nfinally gave up a deed to the disputed land and was rebaptized in 1904.\r\n(Letters of the First Presidency were, however, introduced to show that\r\nit had been the policy of the presidency--particularly in President\r\nWoodruff's day--not to interfere in disputes involving titles to land.)\r\n\r\nIt was testified that a Mormon merchant was expelled from the\r\nChurch, ostensibly for apostasy, but really because he engaged in the\r\nmanufacture of salt \"against the interests of the President of the\r\nChurch and some of his associates;\" that a Mormon Church official was\r\ndeposed \"for distributing, at a school election, a ticket different from\r\nthat prescribed by the Church authorities\"--and so on, interminably.\r\n\r\nWitness after witness swore to the incidents of Church interference\r\nin politics which this narrative has already related in detail. But no\r\nattempt was made to show the Church's partnership with the \"interests;\"\r\nand the power of the Church in business circles was left to be inferred\r\nfrom President Smith's testimony that he was then president of the\r\nZion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution, the State Bank of Utah,\r\nthe Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, the Utah Sugar Company,\r\nthe Consolidated Wagon and Machine Company, the Utah Light and Power\r\nCompany, the Salt Lake and Los Angeles Railroad Company, the Saltair\r\nBeach Company, the Idaho Sugar Company, the Inland Crystal Salt Company,\r\nthe Salt Lake Knitting Company, and the Salt Lake Dramatic Association;\r\nand that he was a director of the Union Pacific Railway Company,\r\nvice-president of the Bullion-Beck and Champion Mining Company, and\r\neditor of the Improvement Era and the Juvenile Instructor.\r\n\r\nIt was shown that Utah had not been admitted to statehood until the\r\nFederal government had exacted, from the Church authorities and the\r\nrepresentatives of the people of Utah, every sort of pledge that\r\npolygamy had been forever abandoned and polygamous relations\r\ndiscontinued by \"revelation from God\"; that statehood had not been\r\ngranted until solemn promise had been given and provision made that\r\nthere should be \"no union of church and state,\" and no church should\r\n\"dominate the state or interfere with its functions;\" and that the\r\nChurch's escheated property had been restored upon condition that such\r\nproperty should be used only for the relief of the poor of the Church,\r\nfor the education of its children and for the building and repair\r\nof houses of worship \"in which the rightfulness of the practice of\r\npolygamy\" should not be \"inculcated.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore the testimony given before the Senate committee by these\r\nmembers of the Mormon hierarchy, showed that they had not only broken.\r\ntheir covenants and violated their oaths, but that they had been guilty\r\nof treason. What was the remedy? Jeremiah M. Wilson, a lawyer employed\r\nby the Church authorities in 1888 to argue, before a Congressional\r\ncommittee, in behalf of the admission of Utah to statehood, had pointed\r\nout the remedy in these words:\r\n\r\n\"It is idle to say that such a compact may be made, and then, when the\r\nconsiderations have been mutually received--statehood on the one side\r\nand the pledge not to do a particular thing on the other--either party\r\ncan violate it without remedy to the other. But you ask me what is\r\nthe remedy, and I answer that there are plenty of remedies in your own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they violate this compact; suppose that after they put this\r\ninto the constitution, and thereby induce you to grant them the high\r\nprivilege and political right of statehood, they should turn right\r\naround and exercise the bad faith which is attributed to them here--what\r\nwould you do? You could shut the doors of the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives against them; you could deny them a voice in the\r\ncouncils of this nation, because they have acted in bad faith and\r\nviolated their solemn agreement by which they succeeded in getting\r\nthemselves into the condition of statehood. You could deny them the\r\nFederal judiciary; you could deny them the right to use the mails--that\r\nindispensable thing in the matter of trade and commerce of this country.\r\nThere are many ways in which peaceably, but all powerfully, you could\r\ncompel the performance of that compact.\"\r\n\r\nThis argument by Mr. Wilson in 1888 was recalled by the counsel for the\r\nprotestants in the investigation. It was recalled with the qualification\r\nthat though Congress might not have the power to undo the sovereignty of\r\nthe state of Utah it could deal with Senator Smoot. And it was further\r\nargued: \"The chief charge against Senator Smoot is that he encourages,\r\ncountenances, and connives at the defiant violation of law. He is an\r\nintegral part of a hierarchy; he is an integral part of a quorum of\r\ntwelve, who constitute the backbone of the Church.... He, as one of that\r\nquorum of twelve apostles, encourages, connives at, and countenances\r\ndefiance of law.\"\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 1906, a majority of the committee made a report to the\r\nSenate recommending that Apostle Smoot was not entitled to his seat in\r\nthe Senate. They found that he was one of a \"self-perpetuating body of\r\nfifteen men, uniting in themselves authority in both Church and state,\"\r\nwho \"so exercise this authority as to encourage a belief in polygamy as\r\na divine institution, and by both precept and example encourage among\r\ntheir followers the practice of polygamy and polygamous cohabitation;\"\r\nthat the Church authorities had \"endeavored to suppress, and succeed\r\nin suppressing, a great deal of testimony by which the fact of plural\r\nmarriages contracted by those who were high in the councils of the\r\nChurch might have been established beyond the shadow of a doubt;\" and\r\nthat \"aside from this it was shown by the testimony that a majority\r\nof those who give law to the Mormon Church are now, and have been for\r\nyears, living in open, notorious and shameless polygamous cohabitation.\"\r\nConcerning President Woodruff's anti-polygamy manifesto of 1890, the\r\nmajority of the committee reported that \"this manifesto in no way\r\ndeclares the principle of polygamy to be wrong or abrogates it as a\r\ndoctrine of the Mormon Church, but simply suspends the practice of\r\npolygamy to be resumed at some more convenient season, either with\r\nor without another revelation.\" They found that Apostle Smoot was\r\nresponsible for the conduct of the organization to which he belonged;\r\nthat he had countenanced and encouraged polygamy \"by repeated acts\r\nand in a number of instances, as a member of the quorum of the twelve\r\napostles;\" and that he was \"no more entitled to a seat in the Senate\r\nthan he would be if he were associating in polygamous cohabitation with\r\na plurality of wives.\"\r\n\r\nThe report continued: \"The First Presidency and the twelve apostles\r\nexercise a controlling influence over the action of the members of\r\nthe Church in secular affairs as well as in spiritual matters;\" and\r\n\"contrary to the principles of the common law under which we live, and\r\nthe constitution of the State of Utah, the First Presidency and twelve\r\napostles dominate the affairs of the State and constantly interfere in\r\nthe performance of its functions.... But it is in political affairs that\r\nthe domination of the First Presidency and the twelve apostles is\r\nmost efficacious and most injurious to the interests of the State....\r\nNotwithstanding the plain provision of the constitution of Utah, the\r\nproof offered on the investigation demonstrates beyond the possibility\r\nof doubt that the hierarchy at the head of the Mormon Church has, for\r\nyears past, formed a perfect union between the Mormon Church and the\r\nState of Utah, and that the Church, through its head, dominates the\r\naffairs of the State in things both great and small.\" And the report\r\nconcluded: \"The said Reed Smoot comes here, not as the accredited\r\nrepresentative of the State of Utah in the Senate of the United States,\r\nbut as the choice of the hierarchy which controls the Church and has\r\nusurped the functions of the State in Utah. It follows, as a necessary\r\nconclusion from these facts, that Mr. Smoot is not entitled to a seat in\r\nthe Senate as a Senator from the State of Utah.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day a minority report was presented by Senators J. B.\r\nForaker, Albert J. Beveridge, Wm. P. Dillingbam, A. J. Hopkins and P.\r\nC. Knox. They found that Reed Smoot possessed \"all the qualifications\r\nprescribed by the Constitution to make him eligible to a seat in the\r\nSenate;\" that \"the regularity of his election\" by the Utah\r\nlegislature had not been questioned; that his private character was\r\n\"irreproachable;\" and that \"so far as mere belief and membership in\r\nthe Mormon Church are concerned, he is fully within his rights and\r\nprivileges under the guaranty of religious freedom given by the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\" Having thus summarily excluded all\r\nthe large and troublesome points of the investigation, these Senators\r\ndecided that there remained \"but two grounds on which the right or title\r\nof Reed Smoot to his seat in the Senate\" was contested. The first was\r\nwhether he had taken a certain \"endowment oath\" by which \"he obligated\r\nhimself to make his allegiance to the Church paramount to his allegiance\r\nto the United States;\" and the second was whether \"by reason of his\r\nofficial relation to the Church\" he was \"responsible for polygamous\r\ncohabitation\" among the Mormons.\r\n\r\nAs to the first charge, the minority found that the testimony upon the\r\npoint was \"limited in amount, vague and indefinite in character and\r\nutterly unreliable, because of the disreputable character of the\r\nwitnesses\"--oddly overlooking the fact that one of these witnesses had\r\nbeen called for Apostle Smoot; that no attempt had been made to impeach\r\nthe character of this witness; that the other witnesses had been\r\ndenounced, by a Mormon bishop, named Daniel Connolly, as \"traitors who\r\nhad broken their oaths to the Church\" by betraying the secrets of\r\nthe \"endowment oath;\" and that all the Smoot witnesses who denied the\r\nanti-patriotic obligation of the oath refused, suspiciously enough, to\r\ntell what obligation was imposed on those who took part in the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe charge that Smoot, as an apostle of the Church, had been responsible\r\nfor polygamous cohabitation was as easily disposed of, by the minority\r\nreport. He had himself, on oath, \"positively denied\" that he had \"ever\r\nadvised any person to violate the law either against polygamy or against\r\npolygamous cohabitation,\" and no witness had been produced to testify\r\nthat Apostle Smoot had ever given \"any such advice\" or defended \"such\r\nacts.\" True, it was admitted that he had \"silently acquiesced\" in the\r\ncontinuance of polygamous cohabitation by polygamists who had married\r\nbefore 1890; but it was contended that to understand this acquiescence\r\nit was \"necessary to recall some historical facts, among which are\r\nsome that indicate that the United States government is not free from\r\nresponsibility for these violations of the law.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, although Reed Smoot was one of a confessed band of\r\nlaw-breaking traitors, he was of \"irreproachable\" private character.\r\nAlthough the band had been guilty of every treachery, none of the band\r\nhad admitted that Smoot had encouraged them in their villainies. Smoot\r\nhad only \"silently acquiesced\"--and in this he had been no guiltier\r\nthan the intimidated bystanders and the gagged victims of the outrages.\r\nAlthough the gang had stolen the machinery of elections and used it to\r\nprint a Senatorial certificate for Smoot, there was nothing to show that\r\nthe form of the certificate was not correct. Moreover, the band operated\r\nin politics as a religious organization, and the constitution of the\r\nUnited States protects a man in his right of religious freedom!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV. Treason Triumphant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these disclosures of the Smoot investigation were shocking the\r\nsentiment of the whole nation, the Prophets carried on the conspiracy of\r\ntheir defense with all the boldness of defiant guilt. In Salt Lake City,\r\nthe office of the United States Marshal and even the post-office were\r\nwatched for the arrival of subpoenas from Washington; men were posted\r\nin the streets to give the alarm whenever the Marshal should attempt to\r\nserve papers; and before he entered the front door of a Mormon's house,\r\nthe Church sentry had entered by the back door to warn the inmates. If\r\nthe Federal power had been moving in a foreign land, it could not\r\nhave been more determinedly opposed by local authority. Notorious\r\npolygamists, wanted as witnesses before the Senate committee, made a\r\npublic flight through Utah, couriered, flanked and rear-guarded by the\r\npower of the hierarchy. One of these law-breakers (who, it was known,\r\nhad been subpoenaed) went from Salt Lake City to take secret employment\r\nin one of the Church's sugar factories in Idaho. When he was discovered\r\nthere and served with the Senate requisition, he gave his word that he\r\nwould appear at Washington, and then he fled with his new polygamous\r\nwife to a polygamous Mormon settlement in Alberta, Canada--a fugitive,\r\nhonored because he was a fugitive, and officially sustained as a ward of\r\nthe Church.\r\n\r\nApostles John W. Taylor and Mathias F. Cowley left the country, to\r\nescape a summons to Washington; and President Smith pleaded that he\r\nhad no control over their movements, and promised that he would, if\r\npossible, bring them back to comply with the Senate subpoenas. He knew,\r\nas every Mormon and every well-informed Gentile knew, that the slightest\r\nexpression of a wish from him would be the word of God to those two men.\r\nThey would have gloried in going to Washington to show the courage\r\nof their fanaticism. They would never have left the country without\r\ninstructions from their President. But they could not have married\r\nplural wives after the manifesto, and solemnized plural marriages\r\nfor other polygamists, without Smith's knowledge and consent; their\r\ntestimony would have placed the responsibility for these unlawful\r\npractices upon the Prophet; and the penalty would have fallen on the\r\nProphet's Senator.\r\n\r\nThey not only fled, but they allowed themselves in their absence to be\r\nmade the scapegoats of the hierarchy. They were proven guilty of \"new\r\npolygamy\" before the Senate committee; and, for the sake of the effect\r\nupon the country, they were ostensibly deposed from the apostolate\r\nby order of the President, who, by their dismissal from the quorum,\r\nadvanced his son Hyrum in seniority. But their apparent degradation\r\ninvolved none of the consequences that Moses Thatcher had suffered. They\r\ncontinued their ministrations in the Church. They remained high in favor\r\nwith the hierarchy. They claimed and received from the faithful the\r\nright to be regarded as holily \"the Lord's' anointed\" as they had\r\never been. They still held their Melchisedec priesthood. One of them\r\nafterward took a new plural wife. It seems to be well authenticated that\r\nthe other continued to perform plural marriages; and every Mormon\r\nlooked upon them both--and still looks upon them--as zealous priests who\r\nendured the appearance of shame in order to preserve the power of the\r\nProphet in governing the nation.\r\n\r\nAnother crucial point in President Smith's responsibility was his\r\nsolemnization of the plural marriage between Apostle Abraham H. Cannon\r\nand Lillian Hamlin, of which I have already written. One of the women\r\nof the dead apostle's family was subpoenaed to give her testimony in the\r\nmatter. She thrice telephoned to me that she wished to consult me; but\r\nshe was surrounded by such a system of espionage that again and again\r\nshe failed to keep her appointment. At last, late at night, she arrived\r\nat my office--the editorial office of the Salt Lake Tribune--having\r\nescaped, as she explained, in her maid's clothes. The agents of the\r\nhierarchy had been subtly and ingeniously suggesting to her that she\r\nwas perhaps mistaken in her recollection of the facts to which she would\r\nhave to testify, and she was distressed with the doubt and fear which\r\nthey had instilled into her mind. I could only adjure her to tell the\r\ntruth as she remembered it. But on her journey to Washington she was\r\nconstantly surrounded by Church \"advisers;\" and the effect of their\r\n\"advice\" showed in the testimony that she gave--a testimony that failed\r\nto prove the known guilt of the Prophet.\r\n\r\nFor the Gentiles, there had begun a sort of \"reign of terror,\" which\r\ncan be best summed up by an account of a private conference of twelve\r\nprominent non-Mormons held as late as 1905. That conference was called\r\nto consider the situation, and to devise means of acquainting the nation\r\nwith the desperate state of affairs in Utah. It was independent of the\r\npolitical movement that had already begun; it aimed rather to organize\r\na social rebellion, so that we might not be dependent for all our\r\nopposition upon the annual or semi-annual campaigns of politics.\r\n\r\nThe meeting first agreed upon the following statement of facts:\r\n\r\n\"Utah's statehood, as now administered, is but a protection of the\r\nMormon hierarchy in its establishment of a theocratic kingdom under\r\nthe flag of the republic. This hierarchy holds itself superior to the\r\nConstitution and to the law. It is spreading polygamy throughout the\r\nranks of its followers. Through its agents, it dominates the politics of\r\nthe state, and its power is spreading to other common-wealths. It\r\nexerts such sway over the officers of the law that the hierarchy and its\r\nfavorites cannot be reached by the hand of justice. It is master of the\r\nState Legislature and of the Governor.\r\n\r\n\"By means of its immense collection of tithes and its large investments\r\nin commercial and financial enterprises, it dominates every line\r\nof business in Utah except mines and railroads; and these latter it\r\ninfluences by means of its control over Mormon labor and by its control\r\nof legislation and franchises. It holds nearly every Gentile merchant\r\nand professional man at its vengeance, by its influence over the\r\npatronage which he must have in order to be successful. It corrupts\r\nevery Gentile who is affected by either fear or venality, and makes of\r\nhim a part of its power to play the autocrat in Utah and to deceive the\r\ncountry as to its purposes and its operations. Every Gentile who\r\nrefuses to testify at its request and in its behalf becomes a marked and\r\nendangered man. It rewards and it punishes according to its will; and\r\nthose Gentiles who have gone to Washington to testify for Smoot are well\r\naware of this fact. Unless the Gentiles of Utah shall soon be protected\r\nby the power of the United States they will suffer either ruin or exile\r\nat the hands of the hierarchy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this declaration had been accepted, by all present, as truly\r\nexpressing their views of the situation, it was decided that they should\r\nconfer with other leading Gentiles, hold a mass meeting, adopt a set of\r\nresolutions embodying the declaration on which they had agreed, and then\r\ndispatch the resolutions to the Senate committee, as a protest against\r\nthe testimony of some of the Gentiles in the Smoot case, and as an\r\nappeal to the nation for help.\r\n\r\nBut although all approved of the declaration and all approved of the\r\nmethod by which it was to be sent to the nation, no man there dared\r\nto stand out publicly in support of such a protest, to offer the\r\nresolutions, or to speak for them. The merchant knew that his trade\r\nwould vanish in a night, leaving him unable to meet his obligations\r\nand certain of financial destruction. The lawyer knew not only that the\r\nhierarchy would deprive him of all his Mormon clients, but that it would\r\nmake him so unpopular with courts and juries that no Gentile litigant\r\nwould dare employ him. The mining man knew that the hierarchy could\r\ndirect legislation against him, might possibly influence courts and\r\ncould assuredly influence jurors to destroy him. And so with all the\r\nothers at the conference.\r\n\r\nThey were not cowards. They had shown themselves, in the past, of more\r\nthan average human courage, loyalty and ability. All recognized that if\r\nthe power of the hierarchy were not soon met and broken it would grow\r\ntoo great to be resisted--that another generation would find itself\r\nhopelessly enslaved. Every father felt that the liberties of his\r\nchildren were at stake; that they would be bond or free by the issue\r\nof the conflict then in course at Washington. And yet not one dared to\r\nthrow down the gauntlet to tyranny--to devote himself to certain ruin.\r\nThey had to prefer simple slavery to beggary and slavery combined. They\r\nhad to hope silently that the power of the nation would intervene. They\r\ncould work only secretly for the fulfillment of that hope.\r\n\r\nAt first, in President Roosevelt they saw the promise of their\r\nsalvation. He had opposed the election of Apostle Smoot. When the report\r\nof the apostle's candidacy had first reached Washington, the President\r\nhad summoned to the White House Senator Thomas Kearns of Utah and\r\nSenator Mark Hanna, who was chairman of the National Republican\r\ncommittee; and to these two men he had declared his opposition to\r\nthe candidacy of a Mormon apostle as a Republican aspirant for a\r\nSenatorship. At his request Senator Hanna, as chairman of the party,\r\nsigned a letter of remonstrance to the party chiefs in Utah, and\r\nPresident Roosevelt, at a later conference, gave this letter to\r\nSenator Kearns to be communicated to the state leaders. Senator Kearns\r\ntransmitted the message, and by so doing he \"dug his political grave\" as\r\nthe Mormon stake president, Lewis W. Shurtliff, expressed it.\r\n\r\nColonel C. B. Loose of Provo went to Washington on behalf of the Church\r\nauthorities. He was a Gentile, a partner of Apostle Smoot and of some of\r\nthe other Mormon leaders in business undertakings, a wealthy mining man,\r\na prominent Republican. It was reported in Utah that his arguments for\r\nSmoot carried some weight in Washington. President Roosevelt was to be\r\na candidate for election; and the old guard of the Republican party,\r\ndistrustful of the Roosevelt progressive policies, was gathering for\r\na grim stand around Senator Mark Hanna. Both factions were playing for\r\nvotes in the approaching national convention. I have it on the authority\r\nof a Mormon ecclesiast, who was in the political confidence of the\r\nChurch leaders, that President Roosevelt was promised the votes of\r\nthe Utah delegation and such other convention votes as the Church\r\npoliticians could control. The death of Senator Hanna made this promise\r\nunnecessary, if there ever was an explicit promise. But this much is\r\ncertain. President Roosevelt's opposition to Apostle Smoot, for whatever\r\nreason, changed to favor.\r\n\r\nThe character and impulses of the President were of a sort to make him\r\npeculiarly susceptible to an appeal for help on the part of the Mormons.\r\nHe had lived in the West. He knew something of the hardships attendant\r\nupon conquering the waste places. He sympathized with those who dared,\r\nfor their own opinions, to oppose the opinions of the rest of the\r\nworld. He had received the most adulating assurances of support for\r\nhis candidacies and his policies. It would have required a man of the\r\ncalmest discrimination and coolest judgment to find the line between\r\nany just claim for mercy presented by the Mormon advocates of \"religious\r\nliberty\" and the willful offenses which they were committing against the\r\nnational integrity.\r\n\r\nI have received it personally, from the lips of more than one member\r\nof the Senate committee, that never in all their experience with public\r\nquestions was such executive pressure brought to bear upon them as was\r\nurged from the White House, at this time, for the protection of Apostle\r\nSmoot's seat in the Senate. The President's most intimate friends on the\r\ncommittee voted with the minority to seat Smoot. One of the President's\r\nclosest adherents, Senator Dolliver, after having signed a majority\r\nreport to exclude Smoot and having been re-elected, in the meantime,\r\nby his own State legislature, to another term in the Senate--afterwards\r\nspoke and voted against the report which he had signed. Senator A. J.\r\nHopkins of Illinois, who had supported Smoot consistently, found himself\r\nbitterly attacked, in his campaign for reelection, because of his\r\nrecord in the Smoot case, and he published in his defense a letter from\r\nPresident Roosevelt that read: \"Just a line to congratulate you upon the\r\nSmoot case. It is not my business, but it is a pleasure to see a public\r\nservant show, under trying circumstances, the courage, ability and sense\r\nof right that you have shown.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the outrageous exposures of the violations of law, the treason\r\nand the criminal indifference to human rights shown by the rulers of\r\nthe Church, if an early vote had been taken by the committee and by\r\nthe Senate itself, the antagonism of the nation would have forced the\r\nexclusion of the Apostle from the upper House. Delay was his salvation.\r\nMore to the President's influence than to any other cause is the delay\r\nattributable that prolonged the case through a term of three years.\r\nDuring that time the unfortunate Gentiles of Utah learned that, instead\r\nof receiving help from the President, they were to have only the most\r\ninsuperable opposition. They believed that the President was being\r\ngrossly misled; that it was, of course, impossible for him to read all\r\nthe testimony given before the Senate committee, and that the matters\r\nthat reached him were being tinged with other purpose than the\r\nvindication of truth and justice. But it was impossible to obtain the\r\nopportunity of setting him right. Even the women who were leading\r\nthe national protest against the polygamous teaching and practices of\r\nSmoot's fellow apostles were told that the President had made up his\r\nmind and could not be re-convinced.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon appeal to his generosity was not confined to Washington. On\r\nhis travels he met President Smith more than once--the Prophet being\r\naccompanied by a different wife each time--and naturally Smith made\r\nevery effort to impress President Roosevelt with his earnestness, the\r\npurity of his life, and the high motives that actuated the exercise\r\nof his authority. And at this sort of pretense the Lord's anointed are\r\nexpert. They themselves may be crude in ideas and coarse in method,\r\nbut their diplomacy is a growth of eighty years of applied devotion and\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nThe American people are used to meeting prominent Mormons who are models\r\nof demeanor who are hearty of manner; who carry a kindly light in their\r\neyes; who have a spontaneity that precludes hypocrisy or even deep\r\npurpose. These are not the men who make the Church diplomacy--they\r\nsimply obey it. It is part of that diplomacy to send out such men for\r\ncontact with the world. But the ablest minds of the Church, whether they\r\nare of the hierarchy or not, construct its policies. And given a system\r\nwhose human units move instantly and unquestioningly at command; given\r\na system whose worldly power is available at any point at any moment;\r\ngiven a system whose movement may be as secret as the grave until\r\nresult is attained--and the clumsiest of politicians or the crudest of\r\ndiplomats has a force to effect his ends that is as powerful for its\r\nsize as any that Christendom has ever known.\r\n\r\nAmong the emissaries of the Church who were deputed to \"reach\" President\r\nRoosevelt, was our old friend Ben Rich, the gay, the engaging, the\r\napparently irresponsible agent of hierarchical diplomacy. And I should\r\nlike to relate the story of his \"approach,\" as it is still related\r\nin the inner circle of Church confidences. Not that I expect it to\r\nbe wholly credited--not that I doubt but it will be denied on all\r\nsides--but because it is so characteristic of Church gossip and so\r\ntypical (even if it were untrue) of the humorous cynicism of Church\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\nWhen President Roosevelt was making his \"swing around the circle,\" Rich\r\nwas appointed to join him, found the opportunity to do so, and (so the\r\nstory is told) delighted the President by the spirit and candor of his\r\ngood fellowship. When they were about to part, the President is reported\r\nto have said, \"Why don't you run for Congress from your state? You're\r\njust the kind of man I'd like to have in the House to support my\r\npolicies.\" And here (as the Mormons are told) is the dialogue that\r\nensued:\r\n\r\nRich: \"I have no ambition that way, Mr. President. For many reasons\r\nit's out of the question although I'm grateful for the flattering\r\nsuggestion.\"\r\n\r\nThe President: \"Then let me appoint you to some good office. You're the\r\nkind of man I'd like to have in my official family.\"\r\n\r\nRich (impressively and in a low tone): \"Mr. President, I'd count it the\r\ngreatest honor of my life to have a commission from you to any office.\r\nI'd hand that commission down to my children as the most precious\r\nheritage. But--I love you too much, Mr. President, to put you in any\r\nsuch hole. I'm a polygamist. It would injure you before the whole\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe President (leaning forward eagerly): \"No! Are you a polygamist? Tell\r\nme all about it.\"\r\n\r\nRich. \"The Lord has bestowed that blessing on me. I wish you could go\r\ninto my home and see how my wives are living together like sisters--how\r\ntender they are to each other--how they bear each other's burdens and\r\nshare each other's sorrows--and how fond all my children are of Mother\r\nand Auntie.\"\r\n\r\nThe President: \"Well--but how can women agree to share a husband?\"\r\n\r\nRich: \"They do it in obedience to a revelation from the Lord--a\r\nrevelation that proclaimed the doctrine of the eternity and the\r\nplurality of the marriage covenant. We believe that men and women,\r\nsealed in this life under proper authority, are united in the conjugal\r\nrelation throughout eternity. We believe that the husband is tied to his\r\nwives, and they to him; that their children and all the generations\r\nof their children will belong to him hereafter. We believe in eternal\r\nprogression; that as man is, God was; and as God is, man shall be. We\r\nbelieve that by obedience to this revealed covenant, we will be exalted\r\nin the celestial realm of our Father, with power in ourselves to create\r\nand people worlds. It is a never ending and constantly increasing\r\nintelligence and labor. If I keep my covenants to my wives and they to\r\nme, in this world, all the powers and rights of our marriage relation\r\nwill be continued and amplified to us in the life to come; and we, in\r\nour turn, will be rulers over worlds and universes of worlds.\"\r\n\r\nThen--according to the unctuous gossip of the devout--President\r\nRoosevelt saw the true answer to his own desire to know what was to\r\nbecome of his mighty personality after this world should have fallen\r\naway from him! He saw, in this faith, a possible continuation throughout\r\neternity of the tremendous energies of his being! He was to continue to\r\nrule not merely a nation but a world, a system of worlds, a universe of\r\nworlds! And it is told--sometimes solemnly, sometimes with a grin--that,\r\nin the Temple at Salt Lake, a proxy has stood for him and he has been\r\nbaptized into the Mormon Church; that proxies have stood for the members\r\nof his family and that they have been sealed to him; and finally that\r\nproxies have stood for some of the great queens of the past (who had not\r\nalready been sealed to Mormon leaders) and that they have been sealed to\r\nthe President for eternity!\r\n\r\n[FOOTNOTE: It is a not uncommon practice in the Mormon Church thus to\r\n\"do a work\" for a Gentile who has befriended the people or otherwise won\r\nthe gratitude of the Church authorities.]\r\n\r\nThis may sound blasphemous toward Theodore Roosevelt--if not toward the\r\nAlmighty--but it is told, and it is believed, by hundreds and thousands\r\nof the faithful among the Mormon people. It is given to them as the\r\nsecret explanation of President Roosevelt's protection of the Mormon\r\ntyranny--a protection of which Apostle Hyrum Smith boasted in a sermon\r\nin the Salt Lake tabernacle (April 5, 1905) in these equivocal words:\r\n\"We believe--and I want to say this--that in President Roosevelt we\r\nhave a friend, and we believe that in the Latter-Day Saints President\r\nRoosevelt has the greatest friendship among them; and there are no\r\npeople in the world who are more friendly to him, and will remain\r\nfriendly unto him just so long as he remains true, as he has been, to\r\nthe cause of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Smiths have their own idea of what \"the cause of humanity\" is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV. The Struggle For Liberty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as 1903, before the Smoot investigation began, the Utah State\r\njournal (of which I became editor) was founded as a Democratic daily\r\nnewspaper, to attempt a restoration of political freedom in Utah and\r\nto remonstrate against the new polygamy, of which rumors were already\r\ninsistent. I was at once warned by Judge Henry H. Rolapp (a prominent\r\nDemocrat on the District bench, and secretary of the Amalgamated Sugar\r\nCompany) that we need not look for aid from the political or business\r\ninterests of the community, inasmuch as our avowed purpose had already\r\nantagonized the Church. He delivered this message in a friendly spirit\r\nfrom a number of Democrats whose support we had been expecting. And\r\nthe warning proved to be well-inspired. Although a number of courageous\r\nGentiles, like Colonel E. A. Wall of Salt Lake City, gave us material\r\naid--and although there was no other Democratic daily paper in\r\nUtah (unless it was the Salt Lake Herald, owned by Senator Clark of\r\nMontana)--the most powerful Church Democratic interests stood against\r\nus, and we found it impossible to make any effective headway with the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nAfter the Prophets began to give their awful testimony at Washington,\r\nthe Democratic National Convention of 1904 (which I attended as a\r\ndelegate from Utah) considered a resolution in opposition to polygamy\r\nand the Church's rule of the state. This resolution was as vigorously\r\nfought by some Utah Gentiles as by the Mormon delegates, on the grounds\r\nthat it would defeat the Democratic party in Utah. It carried in the\r\nconvention. Upon returning to Salt Lake City I called a meeting of the\r\nDemocratic state committee (of which I was chairman) and urged that we\r\nmake our state campaign on the issue of ecclesiastical domination, in\r\nconsonance with the party's national platform. Of the whole committee\r\nonly the secretary, Mr. P. J. Daly, supported the proposal. The others\r\nconsidered it \"an attempt to establish a quarantine against Democratic\r\nsuccess.\" Some of them had been promised by members of the hierarchy\r\nthat the party was to have \"a square deal this time.\" Others had\r\nfatuously accepted the assurances of ecclesiasts that \"it looked like\r\na Democratic year.\" In short, the Democratic party in Utah, like the\r\nRepublican party, proved to be then, as it is now, less a political\r\norganization than the tool of a Church cabal. We found that we could no\r\nmore hope to move the Democratic machine against the hierarchy than to\r\nmove the Smoot-Republican machine itself.\r\n\r\nBut when Joseph F. Smith, before the Senate committee, admitted that he\r\nwas violating \"the laws of God and man\" and tried to extenuate his\r\nguilt with the plea that the Gentiles of Utah condoned it, he issued a\r\nchallenge that no American citizen could ignore. The Gentiles of Utah\r\nhad been silent, theretofore, partly because they were ignorant of the\r\nextent of the polygamous offenses of the hierarchy, and partly because\r\nthey were hoping for better things. Smith's boast made their silence\r\nthe acquiescence of sympathy. A meeting was called in Salt Lake City, in\r\nMay, 1904, and under the direction of Colonel William Nelson, editor of\r\nthe Salt Lake Tribune, the principles of the present \"American party\"\r\nwere enunciated as a protest against the lawbreaking tyranny of the\r\nChurch leaders. Later, as it became clear that the opponents of the\r\nSmith misrule must organize their own party of progress, committees were\r\nformed and a convention was held (in September, 1904) at which a\r\nfull state and county ticket was put in the field, in the name of the\r\nAmerican Party of Utah.\r\n\r\nWe agreed that no war should be made on the Mormon religion as such;\r\nthat no war should be made on the Mormon people because of their being\r\nMormons; that we would draw a deadline at the year 1890, when the\r\nChurch had effected a composition of its differences with the national\r\ngovernment, and all the citizens of Utah, Mormon and Gentile alike, had\r\naccepted the conditions of settlement; that we would find our cause of\r\nquarrel in the hierarchy's violation of the statehood pledges; and that\r\nwhen we had corrected these evil practices we should dissolve, because\r\n(to quote the language used at the time) we did not wish \"to raise a\r\ntyrant merely to slay a tyrant.\"\r\n\r\nIn the idea that we would fight upon living issues--that we would not\r\nopen the graves of the past to dig up a dead quarrel and parade it in\r\nits cerements--the American party movement began. Its first enlistment\r\nincluded practically all the Gentiles in Salt Lake City who resented\r\nthe claim of the Prophet that they acquiesced in his crimes and his\r\ntreasons. But the most promising sign for the party was its attraction\r\nof hundreds of independent Mormons of the younger generation. As one\r\nMormon of that hopeful time expressed it: \"The flag represents the\r\npolitical power. The golden angel Moroni, at the top of the Temple,\r\nrepresents the ecclesiastical authority. I will not pay to either one a\r\ndeference which belongs to the other. I know how to keep them apart in\r\nmy personal devotion.\"\r\n\r\nThis was exactly what the Church authorities would not permit. It would\r\nhave destroyed all the special and selfish prerogatives of the Mormon\r\nhierarchs. It would have subverted their claim of absolute temporal\r\npower. It would have set up the nation and the state as the objects of\r\ncivic devotion--instead of the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nAlthough we of the American party disavowed and abstained from any\r\nattack upon the Mormon Church as such--and confined ourselves to a war\r\nupon the treasons, the violations of law, the breaches of covenant\r\nand the other offenses of the Church leaders, as the practices of\r\nindividuals--these leaders dragged the whole body of the Church as\r\na wall of defense around them, and in countless sermons and printed\r\narticles declared that the Church and its faith were the objects of our\r\nassault. In other words, though Smith claimed in Washington--and Smoot\r\ncontinues to claim before the nation--that the Church is not responsible\r\nfor the crimes of its Prophets, whenever a criticism or a prosecution is\r\ndirected against any of these men, they all unite in declaring that the\r\nChurch is being persecuted; and the members of the hierarchy rouse all\r\ntheir followers, and use all their agencies, in a successful resistance.\r\n\r\nThere was no blithesomeness in the campaign. It was not lightened by any\r\nhumor. It was a hopeless assault on the one side and a grim overpowering\r\nresistance on the other. The American party, being organized as a\r\nprotest, had at first little regard for offices. It sought to promulgate\r\nthe principles of its cause for the enlightenment of the citizens of\r\nUtah and for the preservation of their rights. Some of the Gentiles who\r\ndid not join us felt, perhaps, as strong an indignation as those who\r\ndid, but they were entangled in politics with the hierarchs, or had\r\nbusiness connections that would be destroyed. These men, in course of\r\ntime, became the most dangerous opponents of our progress. (The average\r\nMormon is obedient and supine enough in the presence of his Prophets,\r\nbut he is a man of personal independence compared with the sycophantic\r\nGentile who accepts political or commercial favors from the Church\r\nchiefs and yet continues to deny the existence of the very power to\r\nwhich he bends the knee.) Of the rebellious but discreet Mormons many\r\ncame to the leaders of our party to say: \"I think you're quite right. I,\r\nmyself, have suffered under these tyrannies. I have no sympathy with\r\nnew polygamy. But, as you know, I'm attorney for some of the Church\r\ninterests\"--or \"I'm in business with high ecclesiasts\"--or \"I'm heavily\r\nin debt to the Church bank\"--or \"I'm closely connected by marriage with\r\none of the Prophets\"--\"and I can do you more good by my quiet efforts\r\nthan by coming out into the open. I'd be treated as an apostate. All my\r\ninfluence would be gone.\" And in most cases he preserved his influence,\r\nand we lost him. The Church had effective ways of recovering his\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons the American party looked for its recruits chiefly\r\namong Republicans, the Democracy being almost entirely Mormon. And in\r\nthe first flush of enthusiasm some of our leaders laughed at the boast\r\nof the Republican state chairman that, for every Republican he lost, he\r\nwould get two Mormon Democrats to vote the Republican ticket. (This was\r\nHon. William Spry, a Mormon, since made Governor of Utah, for services\r\nrendered the hierarchy.) But the claim proved anything but laughable.\r\nHe got probably four Mormon Democrats for every Republican he lost. As\r\nusual the hierarchy \"delivered the goods\" to the national organization\r\nin power.\r\n\r\nAccording to our best calculations we got from fifteen hundred to\r\neighteen hundred Mormon votes. And, during this campaign and those that\r\nfollowed, I was approached by hundreds of Mormons who commended our work\r\nand gave private voice to the hope that we might succeed in freeing Utah\r\nso that they themselves might be free. After I joined the staff of the\r\nSalt Lake Tribune, as chief editor, these came to my office by stealth\r\nand in obvious fear. I could not blame them then, nor do I now. The cost\r\nof open defiance was too great.\r\n\r\nOne woman, the first wife of a prominent Mormon physician, came to me\r\nto enlist in the work of the party. (Her husband was living with a\r\nyoung plural wife.) We accepted her aid. Her husband cut off her monthly\r\nallowance, and she had to take employment as a book canvasser, so that\r\nshe might be able to earn her living. One Mormon who came out openly for\r\nus, was superintendent of a business owned by Gentiles. He was somewhat\r\nprominent as an ecclesiast, and he was a Sunday School worker in his\r\nward. He reconciled his wife and daughters to his revolt against the\r\nrecrudescence of polygamy and the tyranny of the Church's political\r\ncontrol. He carried with him the sympathy of his brother, who was a\r\nnewspaper editor. He won over some of his personal friends to pledge\r\ntheir support to our cause. He seemed too sturdy ever to retreat, too\r\nindependent in his circumstances to be driven, and with too clear a\r\nvision to be led astray by the threats, the power, or the persuasions\r\nof the hierarchy. Yet, before long he came to confess that he could not\r\ncontinue to help us openly. His employers--his Gentile employers--had\r\nnotified him that his work in the American party would be dangerously\r\ninjurious to their business. They were in hearty accord with his\r\nviews; they recognized his right as a citizen to act according to his\r\nconvictions; but--they dared not provoke a war of business reprisals\r\nwith the commercial and financial institutions of the Church. He must\r\neither cease his active opposition to the Church leaders, or lose his\r\nplace of employment.... He retired from the fight.\r\n\r\nAnother Mormon who joined us was Don. C. Musser, a son of one of the\r\nChurch historians. He had been a missionary in Germany and in Palestine.\r\nHe had been a soldier in the Philippines, and he had edited the first\r\nAmerican newspaper there. His contact with the world and his experience\r\nin the military service of the United States had given him a high ideal\r\nof his country; and a feeling of loyalty to the nation had superseded\r\nhis earlier devotion to the Prophets. His family was wealthy, but he was\r\nsupporting himself and his young wife by his own efforts in business.\r\nAs soon as he came out openly with the American party, his father's home\r\nwas closed against him. His business connections were withdrawn from\r\nhim. He found himself unable to provide for his wife, who was in\r\ndelicate health. After a losing struggle, he came to tell us that he\r\ncould no longer earn a living in Utah; that he had obtained means to\r\nemigrate; that he must say good-bye. And we lost him.\r\n\r\nTwo other young men--the son and the son-in-law of an apostle--came to\r\nme and asked helplessly for advice. They admitted that the practices\r\nof the hierarchy were, to them, a violation of the covenant with the\r\nnation, a transgression of the revelation from God given to Wilford\r\nWoodruff, and destructive of all the securities of community\r\nassociation. But would I advise them to sacrifice their influence in the\r\nChurch by joining the \"American movement\" publicly? Or had they better\r\nretain their influence and use it within the Church to correct the evils\r\nthat we were attacking?\r\n\r\nWith awful sincerity they spoke of conditions that had come under their\r\nown eyes, and related instances to show how mercilessly the polygamous\r\nfavorites of the Church were permitted to prey on the young women\r\nteachers in Church schools. They spoke of J. M. Tanner, who was at\r\nthat time head of the Church schools, a member of the general Board of\r\nEducation, and one of the Sunday School superintendents. According to\r\nthese young men--and according to general report--Tanner was marrying\r\nright and left.\r\n\r\nI knew of a young Mormon of Brigham City, who had been a suitor for the\r\nhand of L----, a teacher at the Logan College. He had been away from\r\nUtah for some time, and he had returned hoping to make her his wife.\r\nStopping over night in Salt Lake, on his way home, he saw Tanner and\r\nL---- enter the lobby of the hotel in which he sat. They registered as\r\nman and wife and went upstairs together. He followed--to walk the floor\r\nof his room all night, struggling against the impulse to break in, and\r\nkill Tanner, and damn his own soul by meddling with the man who had been\r\nordained by the Prophets to a wholesale polygamous prerogative.\r\n\r\nHe had kept his hands clean of blood, but he had been living ever since\r\nwith murder in his heart. Could these two sons of the Church do more to\r\nremedy such horrors by using their influence to have Tanner deposed, or\r\nby sacrificing that influence in an open revolt against the conditions\r\nthat made Tanner possible? I could only advise them to act according to\r\ntheir own best sense of what was right. They did use their influence to\r\nhelp force Tanner's deposition, but we lost the public example of their\r\nopposition to the crimes of the hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI relate these incidents as typical of the different kinds of pressure\r\nthat were brought to bear upon the independent Mormons who wished to\r\naid us, and of the local difficulties against which we had to contend.\r\nWashington, of course, gave us no recognition. And we did not succeed\r\nin reaching the ear of the nation. Here and there a newspaper noted our\r\neffort and paid some small heed to our protest, but the overwhelming\r\nsuccess of the Republican party--and the dumb-driven acquiescence of\r\nthe Democracy--in Utah and the neighboring Church-ruled states, left the\r\nagitation with little of political interest for the country at large.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the struggle went on. Animated by the spirit of the Salt Lake\r\nTribune, the leading newspaper of the community, the American party\r\nentered the city elections in the fall of 1905 and carried them against\r\nthe hierarchy's Democratic ticket, with the help of the independent\r\nMormons, under cover of the secret ballot. Emboldened by this success\r\nwe proposed to move on the state and county offices, with the hope of\r\ngaining some members of the legislature and some of the judicial and\r\nexecutive offices, through which to enforce the laws that the Church\r\nleaders were defying. But here we failed. Outside of Salt Lake the rule\r\nof the Prophets was still absolute and unquestioned. The people bowed\r\nreverently to Joseph F. Smith's dictum: \"When a man says 'You may direct\r\nme spiritually but not temporally,' he lies in the presence of God--that\r\nis, if he has got intelligence enough to know what he is talking about.\"\r\nThe state politicians knew that they would destroy themselves by joining\r\nan organization opposed by the all-powerful-Church; and sufficient\r\nwarning of this doom appeared to them in the fact that no member of the\r\nAmerican party could obtain any recognition in Federal appointments.\r\nThe Church had meanwhile dictated the election of another United States\r\nSenator (George Sutherland) to join Apostle Smoot, and Senator Kearns\r\nwas retired for his opposition to the hierarchy. [FOOTNOTE: When Senator\r\nAldrich was carrying the tariff bill of 1910 through the Senate, for\r\nthe greater profit of the \"Interests,\" Smoot and Sutherland did not once\r\nvote against him. Smoot supported him on every one of the one hundred\r\nand twenty-nine votes and missed none. Sutherland voted with him one\r\nhundred and seventeen times and was recorded as not voting on the\r\nremaining twelve. Only two other senators made anything like such a\r\ndespicable record.]\r\n\r\nIt began to be more and more apparent that whatever success we might\r\nachieve locally, the power of the financial and political allies of\r\nthe Prophets in Washington, aided by the executive \"Big Stick\" of the\r\nPresident, would beat us back from any attempt to rouse the state or the\r\nnation to our support.\r\n\r\nSmoot was in a happy position: all the senators who represented the\r\n\"Interests\" were for him, and all the senators who represented the\r\nsupposed progressive sentiment of Theodore Roosevelt were also for him.\r\nThe women of the nation had sent a protest with a million signatures to\r\nthe Senate; but they had not votes; they received, in reply, a public\r\nscolding. Long before the Senate voted on its committee's report, many\r\nof the notorious \"new\" polygamists of the Church returned from their\r\nexile in foreign missions and began to walk the streets of Salt Lake\r\nwith their old swagger of self-confident authority. We foresaw the end.\r\n\r\nEarly in December, 1906, Senator J. C. Burrows of Michigan, chairman\r\nof the committee that had investigated Smoot, called up the committee's\r\nreport and spoke upon it in a denunciation of Smoot. Senator Dubois\r\nof Idaho followed, two days later, with a supplementary attack, and\r\ncensured President Roosevelt for \"allowing his name and office\" to be\r\nused in defense of the Mormons. After an interval of a month, Senator\r\nAlbert J. Hopkins, of Illinois, undertook to reply with a defense\r\nof Smoot that reduced the Apostle's excuses to the absurd. Smoot, he\r\ndeclared, had opposed polygamy, \"even from his infancy;\" there was\r\n\"nothing in the constitution\" prohibiting \"a State from having an\r\nestablished Church;\" the old practices of Mormonism were dying out; and\r\nSmoot, as an exponent of the newer Mormonism, was largely responsible\r\nfor the improvement.\r\n\r\nThis bold falsehood was received with laughter by the members who had\r\nheard the testimony before the Senate committee or read the record of\r\nits sittings; but it was wired to all newspapers; and the contradictions\r\nthat followed it failed (for reasons) to get the same publicity. It\r\nwas repeated by Senator Sutherland (January 22, 1907); and he had the\r\naudacity to add that the Mormon Church, as well as Smoot, was opposed to\r\npolygamy; that the \"sporadic cases\" of new polygamy were \"reprehended\r\nby Mormon and Gentile alike;\" that polygamous marriages in Utah had been\r\nforbidden by the Enabling Act, but that polygamous cohabitation had\r\nbeen left to the state; and that the latter was rapidly dying out. And\r\nSutherland knew, as every public man in Utah knew, that almost every\r\nword of this statement was untrue.\r\n\r\nSenator Philander C. Knox, of Pennsylvania (February 14, 1907) took up\r\nthe lie that Smoot had been \"from his youth against polygamy,\" and he\r\nadded to it a legal argument that the Senate could only expel a member,\r\nby a two-thirds vote, if he were guilty of crime, offensive immorality,\r\ndisloyalty or gross impropriety during his term of service. Senator\r\nTillman (February 15) accused President Roosevelt of protecting Smoot\r\nin return for a pledge of Mormon support given previous to the last\r\ncampaign. Apostle Smoot (February 19) declared that cases of \"new\"\r\npolygamy were rare; that they were not sanctioned by the Church; that\r\nevery case since 1890 \"has the express condemnation of the Church;\"\r\nand that he himself had always opposed polygamy. On February 20,\r\nthe question was forced to a vote after a debate that repeated these\r\nfalsehoods, in spite of all disproof's of them. And Apostle Smoot was\r\nretained in his seat by a vote of fifty-one to thirty-seven, counting\r\npairs.\r\n\r\nAfter this event, no growth of organization was immediately possible to\r\nthe American party. Having gained political control of Salt Lake City\r\nand given it good municipal government, we were able to hold a local\r\nadherency; but hundreds of Mormons, who still vote the American city\r\nticket, vote for the Church in state elections, because, though they\r\nwant reform, they are not willing to risk the punishment of their\r\nrelatives and the leaders of the Church to attain that reform. And\r\nwhen the national government granted its patent of approval to the\r\nhierarchy--by holding the hierarchy's appointed representative in\r\nthe Senate as its prophetic monitor--nearly all the people of the\r\nintermountain country lost heart in the fight. Thousands of Gentiles,\r\nwho knew the truth and had fought for it for years, argued despairingly:\r\n\"If the nation likes this sort of thing--I guess it's the sort of thing\r\nit likes. I'm not going to ruin myself financially and politically by\r\nkeeping up a losing struggle with these neighbors of mine, and fight\r\nthe government at Washington besides. If the administration wants to be\r\nbossed by the Prophet, Seer and Revelator, I can stand it.\"\r\n\r\nThe nation, having accepted responsibility for past polygamy, now,\r\nby accepting Senator Smoot, gave its responsible approval to the new\r\npolygamy and to the commercial and political tyrannies of the Church.\r\nIn the old days the Mormons had claimed immunity for their practice\r\nof polygamy on the ground that the constitution of the United States\r\nprotected them in the exercises of their faith. The Supreme Court of the\r\ncountry determined that the free-religion clause of the constitution did\r\nnot cover violations of law; and the Church deliberately abandoned its\r\nclaim of religious immunity. But now a majority of the Senate, supported\r\nby President Roosevelt, took the old ground--which the Supreme Court had\r\nmade untenable and the Mormons themselves had vacated--and practically\r\ndeclared that violations of law were a part of the constitutional\r\nguaranty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI. The Price of Protest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of the Mormon hierarchy continually boast that they are\r\nsustained in their power--and in their abuses of that power--\"by the\r\nfree vote of the freest people under the sun.\" By an amazing self\r\ndeception the Mormon people assume that their government is one of\r\n\"common consent;\" and nothing angers them more than the expression of\r\nany suspicion that they are not the freest community in the world. They\r\nlive under an absolutism. They have no more right of judgment than a\r\ndead body. Yet the diffusion of authority is so clever that nearly every\r\nman seems to share in its operation upon some subordinate, and feels\r\nhimself in some degree a master without observing that he is also a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nThe male members of the ward--who would be called \"laymen\" in any other\r\nChurch--all hold the priesthood. Each is in possession of, or on the\r\nroad to, some priestly office; and yet all are under the absolutism\r\nof the bishop of the ward. Of the hundreds of bishops, with their\r\ncouncillors, each seems to be exercising some independent authority, but\r\nall are obedient to the presidents of stakes. The presidents apparently\r\ndirect the ecclesiastical destinies of their districts, but they are, in\r\nfact, supine and servile under the commands of the apostles; and these,\r\nin turn, render implicit obedience to the Prophet, Seer and Revelator.\r\nNo policy ever arises from the people. All direction, all command, comes\r\nfrom the man at the top. It is not a government by common consent, but\r\na government of common consent--of universal, absolute and unquestioning\r\nobedience--under penalty of eternal condemnation threatened and earthly\r\npunishment sure.\r\n\r\nTwice a year, with a fine show of democracy, the people assemble in the\r\nTabernacle at Salt Lake, and there vote for the general authorities\r\nwho are presented to them by the voice of revelation. If there were no\r\ntragedy, there would be farce in the solemnity with which this pretense\r\nof free government is staged and managed. Some ecclesiast rises in\r\nthe pulpit and reads from his list: \"It is moved and seconded that we\r\nsustain Joseph F. Smith as Prophet, Seer and Revelator to all the world.\r\nAll who favor this make it manifest by raising the right hand.\" No\r\nmotion has been made. No second has been offered. Very often, no adverse\r\nvote is asked. And, if it were, who would dare to offer it? These\r\nleaders represent the power of God to their people; and against them is\r\narrayed \"the power of the Devil and his cohorts among mankind.\" Three\r\ngenerations of tutelage and suppression restrain the members of the\r\nconference in a silent acquiescence. If there is any rebel among them,\r\nhe must stand alone; for he has scarcely dared to voice his objections,\r\nlest he be betrayed, and any attempt to raise a concerted revolt\r\nwould have been frustrated before this opportunity of concerted revolt\r\npresented itself. Being a member of the Church, he must combat the fear\r\nthat he may condemn himself eternally if he raise his voice against the\r\nwill of God. He must face the penalty of becoming an outcast or an\r\nexile from the people and the life that he has loved. He knows that\r\nthe religious zealots will feel that he has gone wilfully \"into outer\r\ndarkness\" through some deep and secret sin of his own; and that the\r\nprudent members of the community will tell him that he should have \"kept\r\nhis mouth shut.\" If there were a majority of the conference inclined\r\nto protest against the re-election of any of its rulers, the lack of\r\ncommunication, the pressure of training and the weight of fear would\r\nkeep them silent. And in this manner, from Prophet down to \"Choyer\r\nleader\" (choir leader) the names are offered and \"sustained by the free\r\nvote of the freest people under the sun.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the days just before the American party's political agitation, a\r\nyoung Mormon, named Samuel Russell, returned from a foreign mission for\r\nthe Church and found that the girl whom he had been courting when he\r\nwent away was married as a plural wife to Henry S. Tanner, brother of\r\nthe other notorious polygamist, J. M. Tanner. The discovery that his\r\nsweetheart was a member of the Tanner household drove Russell almost\r\nfrantic. She was the daughter of an eminent and wealthy family, of\r\nremarkable beauty, well-educated and rarely accomplished. Young Russell\r\nwas a college student--a youth of intellect and high mind--and he\r\nsuffered all the torments of a horrifying shock. Unless he should choose\r\nto commit an act of violence there was only one possible way for him to\r\nprotest. At the next conference, when the name of Henry S. Tanner was\r\nread from the list to be \"sustained\"--as a member of the general Sunday\r\nSchool Board--Russell rose and objected that Tanner was unworthy and a\r\n\"new\" polygamist. He was silenced by remonstrances from the pulpit and\r\nfrom the people. He was told to take his complaint to the President\r\nof his Stake. He was denied the opportunity to present it to the\r\nassemblage.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately afterward, Tanner, for the first time in his life,\r\nwas honored with a seat in the highest pulpit of the Church among the\r\ngeneral authorities. And Russell was pursued by the ridicule of the\r\nMormon community, the persecution of the Church that he had served, the\r\ncontempt of the man who had wronged him, and the anger of the woman whom\r\nhe had loved. One of the reporters of the Deseret News, the Church's\r\nnewspaper, subsequently stated that he had been detailed, with others,\r\nto pursue Russell day and night, soliciting interviews, plaguing\r\nhim with questions, and demanding the legal proofs of Tanner's\r\nmarriage--which, of course, it was known that Russell could not\r\ngive--until Russell's friends, fearing that he might be driven to\r\nviolence, persuaded him to leave the state. Tanner is now reputed to\r\nhave six plural wives (all married to him since the manifesto of 1890)\r\nof whom this young woman is one.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, at the General Conference of April, 1905, Don C. Musser (of\r\nwhom I have already written) attempted to protest against the sustaining\r\nof Apostles Taylor and Cowley; but Joseph F. Smith promptly called upon\r\nthe choir to sing, and Musser's voice was drowned in harmony. In more\r\nrecent years Charles J. Bowen rose at a General Conference to object to\r\nthe sustaining of some of the polygamous authorities, and he was hustled\r\nfrom the building by the ushers.\r\n\r\nBut the most notable case of individual revolt of this period was\r\nCharles A. Smurthwaite's. He had joined the Church, alone, when a boy in\r\nEngland, and the sufferings he had endured, for allying himself with\r\nan ostracized sect, had made him a very ardent Mormon. He had become\r\na \"teacher\" in his ward of Ogden City, had succeeded in business as a\r\ncommission merchant and was a great favorite with his bishop and his\r\npeople, because of his charities and a certain gentle tolerance of\r\ndisposition and kindly brightness of mind.\r\n\r\nSmurthwaite, in partnership with Richard J. Taylor (son of a former\r\nPresident of the Church, John Taylor) engaged in the manufacture of\r\nsalt, with the financial backing of a leading Church banker. Along the\r\nshores of Salt Lake, salt is obtained, by evaporation, at the cost of\r\nabout sixty cents a ton; its selling price, at the neighboring smelting\r\ncenters, ranges from three dollars to fourteen dollars a ton; and the\r\nindustry has always been one of the most profitable in the community.\r\nIn the early days, the Church (as I have already related) encouraged the\r\nestablishment of \"salt gardens,\" financed the companies, protected them\r\nin their leasehold rights along the lake shores, and finally, through\r\nthe Inland Crystal Salt Company, came to control a practical monopoly\r\nof the salt industry of the intermountain country. (This Inland Crystal\r\nCompany, with Joseph F. Smith as its president, is now a part of the\r\nnational salt trust.)\r\n\r\nAfter Smurthwaite and Taylor had invested heavily in the land and plant\r\nof their salt factory, the Church banker who had been helping them\r\nnotified them that they had better see President Smith before they went\r\nany further. They called on Smith in his office, and there--according to\r\nSmurthwaite's sworn testimony before the Senate committee--the Prophet\r\ngave them notice that they must not compete with his Inland Crystal\r\nSalt Company by manufacturing salt, and that if they tried to, he would\r\n\"ruin\" them. This proceeding convinced Smurthwaite that Smith had\r\n\"so violent a disregard and non-understanding of the rights of his\r\nfellow-man and his duty to God, as to render him morally unqualified for\r\nthe high office which he holds.\" For expressing such an opinion of Smith\r\nto elders and teachers--and adding that Smith was not fit to act as\r\nProphet, Seer and Revelator, since, according to his own confession\r\nto the Senate Committee he was \"living in sin\"--for expressing these\r\nopinions, charges were preferred against Smurthwaite by an elder named\r\nGoddard of Ogden City, and excommunication proceedings were begun\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nSmurthwaite replied by making a charge of polygamous cohabitation\r\nagainst Goddard; and after the April Conference of 1905, Don Musser and\r\nSmurthwaite joined in filing a complaint in the District Court of Salt\r\nLake City demanding an accounting from Joseph F. Smith of the tithes\r\nwhich the Church was collecting. Meanwhile Smurthwaite had been\r\n\"disfellowshipped\" at a secret session of the bishop's court, on March\r\n22, without an opportunity of appearing in his own defense or having\r\ncounsel or witnesses heard in support of his case; and on April 4, after\r\na similarly secret and ex-parte proceeding, he was excommunicated by the\r\nHigh Council of his Stake, for \"apostasy and un-Christianlike conduct.\"\r\nHis charges against Goddard were ignored, and his suit for an accounting\r\nof the tithes was dismissed for want of jurisdiction!\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of his first public protest against Smith, all\r\nSmurthwaite's former associates fell away from him, and by many of the\r\nmore devout he was shunned as if he were infected. Benevolent as he had\r\nbeen, he could find no further fellowship even among those whom he had\r\nbenefited by his service and his means. I know of no more blameless life\r\nthan his had been in his home community--and, to this, every one of\r\nhis acquaintances can bear testimony--yet after the brutally unjust\r\nproceedings of excommunication against him the Deseret News, the\r\nChurch's daily paper, referred to \"recent cases of apostasy and\r\nexcommunication\" as having been made necessary by the \"gross immorality\"\r\nof the victims. When a man like Chas. A. Smurthwaite could not\r\nremonstrate against the individual offenses of Joseph F. Smith, without\r\nbeing overwhelmed by financial disaster, and social ostracism, and\r\npersonal slander, it must be evident how impossible is such single\r\nrevolt to the average Mormon. Nothing can be accomplished by individual\r\nprotest except the ruin of the protestant and his family.\r\n\r\nIn the case of my own excommunication, the issues were perhaps less\r\nclearly defined than in Smurthwaite's. I had not been for many years a\r\nformal member of the Church; and yet in the sense that Mormonism is a\r\ncommunity system (as much as a religion) I had been an active and loyal\r\nmember of it. In my childhood--when I was seven or eight years of age--I\r\nbegan to doubt the faith of my people; and I used to go into the orchard\r\nalone and thrust sticks lightly into the soft mould and pray that God\r\nwould let them fall over if the Prophets had not been appointed by Him\r\nto do His work. And sometimes they fell and sometimes they stood! Later,\r\nwhen I was appalled by some of the things that had occurred in the early\r\nhistory of the Church, I silenced myself with the argument that one\r\nshould not judge any religion by the crudities and intolerance's of its\r\npast. I felt that if I were not hypocritical--if I were myself guided by\r\nthe truth as I saw it myself--and if I aided to the utmost of my power\r\nin advancing the community out of its errors, I should be doing all that\r\ncould be asked of me. In the days of Mormon misery and proscription,\r\nI chose to stand with my own people, suffering in their sufferings\r\nand rejoicing with them in their triumphs. Their tendency was plainly\r\nupward; and I felt that no matter what had been the origin of the\r\nChurch--whether in the egotism of a man or in an alleged revelation from\r\nGod--if the tendencies were toward higher things, toward a more even\r\njustice among men, toward a more zealous patriotism for the country, no\r\nman of the community could do better than abide with the community.\r\n\r\nThe Church authorities accepted my aid with that understanding of my\r\nposition toward the Mormon religion; and, though Joseph F. Smith, in\r\n1892, for his own political purposes, circulated a procured statement\r\nthat I was \"a Mormon in good standing,\" later, when he was on the\r\nwitness stand in the Smoot investigation, he testified concerning me:\r\n\"He is not and never has been an official member of the Church, in any\r\nsense or form.\" I made no pretenses and none were asked of me. I was\r\nglad to give my services to a people whom I loved, and trusted, and\r\nadmired; and the leaders were as eager to use me as I was eager to be\r\nused in the proper service of my fellows. (Even Joseph F. Smith, in\r\nthose days, was glad to give me his \"power of attorney\" and to trust me\r\nwith the care of the community's financial affairs.) But when all the\r\nhierarchy's covenants to the nation were being broken; when the tyranny\r\nof the Prophet's absolutism had been re-established with a fierceness\r\nthat I had never seen even in the days of Brigham Young; when polygamy\r\nhad been restored in its most offensive aspect, as a breach of the\r\nChurch's own revelation; when hopelessly outlawed children were being\r\nborn of cohabitation that was clandestine and criminal under the \"laws\r\nboth of God and of man\"--it was impossible for me to be silent either\r\nbefore the leaders of the Church or in the public places among the\r\npeople. I had spoken for the Mormons at a time when few spoke for\r\nthem--when many of the men who were now so valiantly loyal to the\r\nhierarchy had been discreetly silent. I had helped defend the Mormon\r\nreligion when it had few defenders. I did not propose to criticize it\r\nnow; for to me, any sincere belief of the human soul is too sacred to be\r\nso assailed--if not out of respect, surely in pity--and the Mormon faith\r\nwas the faith of my parents. But I was determined to make the strongest\r\nassault in my power on the treason and the tyranny which Smith and\r\nhis associates in guilt were trying to cover with the sanctities of\r\nreligion; and I had to make that assault, as a public man, for a public\r\npurpose, without any consideration of private consequences.\r\n\r\nAfter I began criticizing the Church leaders, in the editorial columns\r\nof the Salt Lake Tribune, my friend Ben Rich, then president of the\r\nSouthern States Missions, and J. Golden Kimball, one of the seven\r\npresidents of the seventies, came to me repeatedly to suggest that if\r\nI wished to attack the leaders of the Church I should formally withdraw\r\nfrom the Church. This I declined to do: because I was in no different\r\nposition toward the teachings of the Church than I had been in previous\r\nyears--because I was not criticizing the Church or its religious\r\nteachings, but attacking the civil offenses of its leaders as citizens\r\nguilty against the state--and because I saw that my attack had more\r\npower as coming from a man who stood within the community, even though\r\nhe had no standing in the Church. I continued as I had begun. After\r\nthe publication of an editorial (January 22, 1905), in which I charged\r\nPresident Smith with being all that the testimony then before the Senate\r\ncommittee had proven him to be, Ben Rich advised me that I must either\r\nwithdraw from the Church or Smith would proceed against me in the Church\r\ntribunals and make my family suffer. I replied that I would not withdraw\r\nand that I would fight all cases against me on the issue of free speech.\r\nOn February 1, 1905, I published, editorially, \"An address to the\r\nEarthly King of the Kingdom of God,\" in which I charged Smith with\r\nhaving violated the laws (revelations) of his predecessors; with having\r\nmade and violated treaties upon which the safety of his \"subjects\"\r\ndepended; with having taken the bodies of the daughters of his subjects\r\nand bestowed them upon his favorites; with having impoverished his\r\nsubjects by a system of elaborate exaction's (tithes) in order to enrich\r\n\"the crown\" and so forth. All of which, burlesquely written as if to a\r\nCzar by a constitutionalist, was accepted by the Mormon people as in no\r\nway absurd in its tone as coming from one American citizen to another!\r\n\r\nBecause of these two editorials I was charged (February 21, 1905)\r\nbefore a ward bishop's court in Ogden with \"un-Christianlike conduct\r\nand apostasy,\" after two minor Church officials had called upon me at my\r\nhome and received my acknowledgment of the authorship of the editorials,\r\nmy refusal to retract them, and my statement that I did not \"sustain\"\r\nJoseph F. Smith as head of the Church, since he was \"leaving the worship\r\nof God for the worship of Mammon and leading the people astray.\" On the\r\nnight of February 24, I appeared in my own defense before the bishop's\r\ncourt, at the hour appointed, without witnesses or counsel, because I\r\nhad been notified that no one would be permitted to attend with me. And,\r\nof course, the defense I made was that the articles were true and that I\r\nwas prepared to prove them true.\r\n\r\nSuch a court usually consists of a bishop and his two councillors, but\r\nin this case the place of the second councillor had been taken by a high\r\npriest named Elder George W. Larkin, a man reputed to be \"richly endowed\r\nwith the Spirit.\" I had a peculiar psychological experience with Larkin.\r\nAfter I had spoken at some length in my own defense, Larkin rose to work\r\nhimself up into one of the rhapsodies for which he was noted. \"Brother\r\nFrank,\" he began, \"I want to bear my testimony to you that this is the\r\nwork of God--and nothing can stay its progress--and all who\r\ninterfere will be swept away as chaff\"--rising to those transports of\r\nauto-hypnotic exaltation which such as he accept as the effect of the\r\nspirit of God speaking through them. \"You were born in the covenant,\r\nand the condemnation is more severe upon one who has the birthright\r\nthan upon one not of the faith who fights against the authority of\r\nGod's servants.\" I had concluded to try the effect of a resistant mental\r\nforce, and while I stared at him I was saying to myself: \"This is a mere\r\nvapor of words. You shall not continue in this tirade. Stop!\" He began\r\nto have difficulty in finding his phrases. The expected afflatus did not\r\nseem to have arrived to lift him. He faltered, hesitated, and finally,\r\nwith an explanation that he had not been feeling well, he resumed his\r\nseat, apologetically.\r\n\r\nThat left me free to \"bear testimony\" somewhat myself. I warned the\r\nmembers of the \"court\" that no work of righteousness could succeed\r\nexcept by keeping faith with the Almighty--which meant keeping faith\r\nwith his children upon earth. I reminded them of the dark days, which\r\nall of them could recall, when we had repeatedly covenanted to God and\r\nto the nation that if we could be relieved of what we deemed the world's\r\noppression we would fulfill every obligation of our promises. I pointed\r\nout to them that the Church was passing into the ways of the world;\r\nthat our people were being pauperized; that some of them were in the\r\npoorhouses in their old age after having paid tithes all their active\r\nlives; that by our practices we were bearing testimony against the\r\nrevelations which Mormons proclaimed to the world for the salvation of\r\nthe bodies and souls of men.\r\n\r\nThey listened to me with the same friendly spirit that had marked all\r\ntheir proceedings for these men had no animosity against me; they were\r\nmerely obeying the orders of their superiors. And when we arose to\r\ndisperse, the bishop put his hand on my shoulder and said, in the usual\r\nform of words: \"Brother Frank, we will consider your case, and if we\r\nfind you ought to do anything to make matters right, we will let you\r\nknow what it is.\"\r\n\r\nI returned to my home, where I had left my wife and children chatting at\r\nthe dinner table. They had known where I was going. They knew what the\r\nissue of my \"trial\" would be for them and for me. Yet when I came back\r\nto them, none asked me any questions and none seemed perturbed. And this\r\nis typical of the Mormon family. I think the experiences through which\r\nthe people have passed have given them a quality of cheerful patience.\r\nThey have been schooled to bear persecution with quiet fortitude.\r\nTragedy sweeps by them in the daily current of life. A young man goes\r\non a mission, and dies in a foreign land; and his parents accept their\r\nbereavement like Spartans, almost without mourning, sustained by the\r\nreligious belief that he has ended his career gloriously. Taught to\r\ndevote themselves and their children and their worldly goods to the\r\nservice of their Church, they accept even the impositions and injustices\r\nof the Church leaders with a powerful forbearance that is at once a\r\nstrength and a weakness.\r\n\r\nTwo days later I was met on the street by a young Dutch elder, who could\r\nscarcely speak English, and he gave me the official document from\r\nthe bishop's court notifying me that I had been \"disfellowshipped for\r\nun-Christianlike conduct and apostasy.\" I was then summoned to appear\r\nbefore the High Council of the Stake in excommunication proceedings, and\r\nafter filing a defense which it is unnecessary to give here--and after\r\nrefusing to appear before the Council for reasons that it is equally\r\nunnecessary to repeat I was excommunicated on March 14, 1905. No denial\r\nwas made by the Church authorities of any of the charges which I had\r\nmade against Smith. No trial was made of the truth of those charges. As\r\na free citizen of \"one of the freest communities under the sun,\" I was\r\nofficially ostracized by order of the religious despot of the community\r\nfor daring to utter what everyone knew to be the truth about him.\r\n\r\nFor myself, of course, no edict of excommunication had any terrors; but\r\nthe aim of the authorities was to make me suffer through the sufferings\r\nof my family; and, in that, they succeeded. I shall not write of it. It\r\nhas little place in such a public record as this, and I do not wish\r\nto present myself, in any record, as a martyr. It was not I who was\r\nostracized from the Mormon Church by my excommunication; it was the\r\nright of free speech. The Mormon Church deprived me of nothing; it\r\ndeprived itself of the helpful criticism of its members. No anathema of\r\nbigotry could take from me the affection of my family or the respect\r\nof any friends whose respect was worth the coveting. In that regard I\r\nsuffered only in my pity for those of my neighbors who were so blindly\r\nservile to the decrees of religious tyranny that they turned their backs\r\non the voice of their own liberty raised, in protest, for their own\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not by the individual protestants but by the entire community\r\nthat the heaviest price was paid in this whole conflict. It divided the\r\nstate again into the old factions and involved it in the old war from\r\nwhich it had been rescued. The Mormons instituted a determined boycott\r\nagainst all Gentiles, and \"Thou shalt not support God's enemies\" became\r\na renewed commandment of the Prophet. Wherever a Gentile was employed\r\nin any Mormon institution, he was discharged, almost without exception,\r\nwhether or not he had been an active member of the American party.\r\nTeachers in the Church would exclaim with horror if they heard that\r\na Mormon family was employing a Gentile physician; and more than one\r\nMormon litigant was advised that he not only \"sinned against the work of\r\nGod,\" but endangered the success of his law suit, by retaining a Gentile\r\nlawyer. Politicians were told that if they aided the American party,\r\nthey need never hope for advancement in this world, or expect anything\r\nbut eternal condemnation in the world to come; and though few of\r\nthem counted on the \"spoils\" of the hereafter, they understood and\r\nappreciated the power of the hierarchy to reward in the present day. The\r\nGentiles did not attempt any boycott in retaliation; they had not the\r\nsolidarity necessary to such an attempt; and many Gentile business men,\r\nin order to get any Mormon patronage whatever, were compelled to employ\r\nnone but Mormon clerks.\r\n\r\nThe Gentiles had been largely attracted to Utah by its mines; they were\r\nheavily interested in the smelting industry. Colonel B. A. Wall, one of\r\nthe strongest supporters of the American party, owned copper properties,\r\nwas an inventor of methods of reduction, and had large smelting\r\nindustries. Ex-Senator Thomas Kearns, and his partner David Keith,\r\nowners of the Salt Lake Tribune, and many of their associates, had their\r\nfortunes in mines and smelters; they were leaders of the American\r\nparty and they were attempting to enlist with them such men as W.\r\nS. McCornick, a Gentile banker and mine owner, and D. C. Jackling,\r\npresident of the Utah Copper Company, who is now one of the heads of the\r\nnational \"copper combine\" and one of the ablest men of the West.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, in the midst of the political crisis, the Church newspapers\r\nserved editorial notice on these men that, on account of the smelter\r\nfumes and their destructive effect upon the vegetation of the valley,\r\nthe smelters must go; and that if the present laws were not sufficient,\r\nnew laws would be enacted to drive them out. Men like Wall and Keith and\r\nKearns and Walker were not terrorized; but McCornick and Jackling and\r\nthe representatives of the American Smelting and Refining Company either\r\nsurrendered to a discreet silence or openly joined the Church in the\r\ncampaign. They were rewarded with the assurance that the Church would\r\nprotect them against any labor trouble and that no adverse legislation\r\nwould be attempted against them. Today Jackling, of the copper combine,\r\nis a newspaper partner of Apostle Smoot, and he is mentioned for\r\nthe United States Senate as the Church's selection to succeed George\r\nSutherland. The Church has large mining interests; Smoot and Smith\r\nare in close affiliation with the smelting trust; and this is another\r\npowerful partnership in Washington that protected Smoot in his seat and\r\nhas been rewarded by the Church's assistance in looting the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII. The New Polygamy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old days of Mormonism--and as late as the anti-polygamous\r\nmanifesto of 1890--the whole aim and effort of the Church was to exalt\r\nand sanctify and make pure the practice of plural marriage by means of\r\nthe community's respect and the reverences of religion. The doctrine of\r\npolygamy was taught as a revealed mystery of faith. It was accepted as\r\na sacrament ordained by God for the salvation of mankind. The most\r\nimportant families in the Church dignified it by their participation,\r\nand were in turn dignified by the Church's approval and by the wealth\r\nand power that followed approval. The inevitable mental sufferings\r\nof the plural wives were endured by them as part of an earthly\r\nself-immolation required by God, for which they should be rewarded in\r\neternity. The very necessities of their situation compelled them\r\nto exact and cherish a super reverence for the doctrine of plural\r\nmarriage--since the only way a mother could justify herself to her\r\nchildren was by teaching, as she believed, that she had been selected\r\nby God for the exaltation of this sacrifice, and by inculcating in her\r\nchildren a scrupulous respect for sexual purity. There was no pretense\r\nof denial of the polygamous relation. Plural wives held the place\r\nof honor in the community. Their marriages were considered the most\r\nsanctified. They and their progeny were called \"the wives and children\r\nof the holy covenant,\" and they were esteemed accordingly.\r\n\r\nBut as the history of the Church shows, plural marriage was always a\r\nheavy cross to the Mormon women; many had refused to bear it, in the\r\nface of the frequent pulpit scoldings of the Prophets; and few did not\r\nsometime weep under it in the secrecy of their family life. In the days\r\nimmediately preceding the manifesto of 1890, there was a general hope\r\nand longing among the Mormon mothers that God would permit a relief\r\nbefore their daughters and their sons should become of an age to be\r\ndrafted into the ranks of polygamy. The great majority of the young\r\nmen were monogamists. It required the strong persuasions of personal\r\naffection as well as the authority of Divine command to make the young\r\nwomen accept a polygamist in marriage. And when the Church received\r\nPresident Woodruff's anti-polygamous revelation, every profound human\r\nemotion of the people coincided with the promise to abstain.\r\n\r\nOnly among a few of the polygamous leaders themselves was there any\r\ninclination to break the Church's pledge--an inclination that was\r\nstrengthened by resentment against the Federal power that had compelled\r\nthe giving of the pledge. Almost immediately upon obtaining the\r\nfreedom of statehood, some of these leaders returned to the practice of\r\npolygamous cohabitation--although they had accepted the revelation,\r\nhad bound themselves by their covenant to the nation and had solemnly\r\nsubscribed to the terms of their amnesty. To justify themselves, they\r\nfound it necessary to teach that polygamy was still approved by the law\r\nof God--that the practice of plural marriage had only been abandoned\r\nbecause it was forbidden by the laws of man. Joseph F. Smith continued\r\nto live with his five wives and to rear children by all of them.\r\nThose of the apostles who were not assured of that attainment to the\r\nprincipality of Heaven which was promised the man of five wives and\r\nproportionate progeny, were naturally tempted (if, indeed, they were not\r\nactually encouraged) to take Joseph F. Smith as their examplar. It was\r\nscarcely worse to break the covenant by taking a new polygamous wife\r\nthan by continuing polygamous relations with former plural wives; and\r\nwhen an apostle took a new polygamous wife, his inevitable and necessary\r\ncourse was to justify himself by the authority of God. He could not then\r\ndeny the same authority to the minor ecclesiasts, even if he had wished\r\nto. And, finally, when the evil circle spread to the man on the fringe\r\nof the Church--who could not obtain even such poor authorization for his\r\nperfidy he found a way to perpetrate a pretended plural marriage with\r\nhis victim, and the Church authorities did not dare but protect him.\r\n\r\nThis was polygamy without the great saving grace that had previously\r\ndefended the Mormon women from the cruelties and abuses of the practice.\r\nIt was polygamy without honor--polygamy against an assumed revelation\r\nof God instead of by virtue of one--polygamy worse than that of the\r\nMohammedans, since it was necessarily clandestine, could claim no social\r\nrespect or acceptance, and was forbidden \"by the laws of God and man\"\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nThis is the \"new polygamy\" of Mormonism. The Church leaders dare not\r\nacknowledge it for fear of the national consequences. They dare not even\r\nsecretly issue certificates of plural marriage, lest the record should\r\nbe betrayed. They protect the polygamist by a conspiracy of falsehood\r\nthat is almost as shameful as the shame it seeks to cover; and the\r\ninfection of the duplicity spreads like a plague to corrupt the whole\r\nsocial life of the people. The wife of a new polygamist cannot claim\r\na husband; she has no social status; she cannot, even to her parents,\r\nprove the religious sanction for her marital relations. Her children\r\nare taught that they must not use a father's name. They are hopelessly\r\noutside the law--without the possibility that any further statutes\r\nof legitimization will be enacted for their relief. They are born in\r\nfalsehood and bred to the living of a lie. Their father cannot claim\r\nthe authority of the Church for their parentage, for he must protect his\r\nProphet. He cannot even publicly acknowledge them--any more than he can\r\npublicly acknowledge their mother.\r\n\r\nOut of these terrible conditions comes such an instance as the notorious\r\ncase of one of Henry S. Tanner's wives, who went on a visit to one\r\nof her relatives, with her children, and denied that they were her\r\nchildren, and denied that she was married--and was supported by her\r\nchildren's denial that she was their mother. Similarly, a plural wife of\r\na wealthy Mormon, whose fortune is estimated at $25,000,000--a partner\r\nof the sugar trust, a community leader, a favorite of the Church went\r\nbefore the Senate Committee in December, 1904, and swore that her first\r\nhusband had died thirteen years before, that she had had a child within\r\nsix years, and that she had no second husband. And by doing so she not\r\nonly marked the child as illegitimate beyond the relief of any future\r\nstatutes--legitimizing the offspring of polygamous marriages, but she\r\nleft herself and the child without any claim upon the estate of its\r\nfather and publicly swore herself a social outcast before a committee of\r\nthe United States Senate, and perjured herself--to the knowledge of all\r\nher friends and acquaintances in Utah--for the protection of her husband\r\nand her Church. What can one say of a man who will permit a woman to\r\ncommit such an act of social suicide for him--or of a Church that will\r\ncommand it?\r\n\r\nHere is a condition of society unparalleled anywhere else in\r\ncivilization--unparalleled even in barbarous countries, for wherever\r\nelse polygamy is practiced it at least has the sanction of local\r\nconvention. And the consequent suffering that falls upon the women and\r\nthe children is a heart-break to see. During the days when I was in the\r\neditorial office of the Salt Lake Tribune, scores of miserable cases\r\ncame to my knowledge by letter, by the report of friends, and by the\r\nvisits of the agonized wives themselves. I shall never forget one young\r\nwoman, in her twenties, who came to ask my help in forcing her husband\r\nto obtain a marriage certificate for her from the Church, so that her\r\nboy might have the right to claim a father. She wept, with her head\r\non my desk, sobbing out her story, and appealing to me for aid with a\r\nconvulsed and tear-drenched face.\r\n\r\nFour years earlier, she had become friendly with a man twice her age,\r\nwhom she admired and respected. He had taken two wives before the\r\nmanifesto of 1890, but that did not prevent him from coveting the youth\r\nand beauty of this young woman. He first approached her mother for\r\npermission to marry the girl, and when the mother-who was herself a\r\nplural wife replied that it was impossible under the law, he brought an\r\napostle to persuade her that the practice of plural marriage was\r\nstill as meet, just and available to salvation as it had been when she\r\nmarried. Then he went to the daughter.\r\n\r\n\"I was terrified,\" she said, \"when he proposed to me. And yet--he asked\r\nme if I thought my mother had done wrong when she married my father....\r\nThere was no one else I liked as much. He was good. He was rich. He\r\ntold me I'd never want for anything. He said I would be fulfilling the\r\ncommand of God against the wickedness of a persecuting world.... I don't\r\nknow what devil of fanaticism entered into me. I thought it would be\r\nsmart to defy the United States.\"\r\n\r\nLate one night, by appointment, he called for her with a carriage,\r\ndriven by a man unknown to her, and took her to a darkened house that\r\nhad a dim light only in the hallway. They entered alone and turned into\r\na parlor that was dark, except for the reflection from the hall. He led\r\nher up to the portieres that hung across an inner door, and through the\r\nopening between the curtains she saw the indistinct figure of a man.\r\nThey stood before him, hand in hand, while he mumbled over the words of\r\na ceremony that sounded to her like the ceremonies she had heard in\r\nthe Temple. She caught little of it clearly; she remembered practically\r\nnothing. She was not given anything to show that a ceremony had been\r\nperformed, and she did not ask for anything. The elderly bridegroom\r\nkissed her when the mumbling ceased, led her out to the carriage, took\r\nher back to her mother's house, and that night became her husband.\r\n\r\nShe bore him a son. No one except her mother, her father and a few\r\ntrusted friends knew that she was married. In the early months of 1905\r\nshe read in the Tribune the testimony given before the Senate committee\r\nby Professor James E. Talmage, for the Church, to the effect that since\r\nthe manifesto of 1890 neither the President of the Church nor anybody\r\nelse in the Church had power to authorize a plural marriage, and that\r\nany woman who had become a plural wife, since the manifesto, was \"no\r\nmore a wife by the law of the Church, than she is by the law of the\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nShe asked her husband about it. He replied that an apostle had married\r\nthem. \"I asked my husband,\" she said, \"to get a certificate of marriage\r\nfrom the apostle. He told me I needed none--that it was recorded in\r\nthe books here and recorded in heaven--that it would put the apostle in\r\ndanger if he were to sign such a paper. I said that that was nothing to\r\nme--that I wanted to protect my good name. Finally, he said it was not\r\nan apostle. Then we had a bitter scene. And he did not come back for a\r\nlong time. And he didn't write as long as he stayed away.\r\n\r\n\"When he came back he was more loving than ever. I was afraid of having\r\nmore children. I said to him: 'You cannot hold me as a wife any longer\r\nunless you write a paper certifying that I'm your wife and this boy is\r\nyour child. You may place that paper anywhere you like, so long as I\r\nknow I can get it in case you die. Suppose you were to die and all\r\nyour folks were to deny that I was your wife--say that I was an\r\nimposter--that I was trying to foist my boy on the estate of a dead\r\nman--in the name of God, then what could I do?' He went away; and he\r\nhasn't come back; and he hasn't written. I don't know who married us. I\r\ndon't even know the house where it happened. I don't know who the driver\r\nwas. I don't even know who the apostle was that told mother it would be\r\nall right. He made her promise under a covenant not to tell.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know where to go. A friend of mine told me you would advise me.\r\nHe said perhaps you could make them give me a certificate. I don't want\r\nto expose my husband. I only want something so that my boy, when he\r\ngrows up, won't be\"--\r\n\r\nWhat could I do? What could anyone do for this unfortunate girl, seduced\r\nin the name of religion, with the aid of a Church that repudiated her\r\nfor its own protection? She had to suffer, and see her boy suffer, the\r\npenalties of a social outcast.\r\n\r\nHer case was typical of many that came to my personal knowledge. At\r\nthe Sunday Schools, in the choirs, in the joint meetings of mutual\r\nimprovement associations, young girls--taught to believe that plural\r\nmarriage was sacred, and reverencing the polygamous prophets as the\r\nanointed of the Lord--were being seduced into clandestine marriage\r\nrelations with polygamous elders who persuaded their victims that the\r\nanti-polygamous manifesto had been given out to save a persecuted people\r\nfrom the cruelties of an unjust government; that it was never intended\r\nit should be obeyed; that all the celestial blessings promised by\r\nrevelation to the polygamist and his wives were still waiting for those\r\nwho would dare to enjoy them.\r\n\r\nIf the tempted girl turned to one of her women friends, and besought\r\nher to say, on her honor, whether she thought that plural marriage was\r\nright, the other was likely enough to answer: \"Yes, yes. Indeed it is.\r\nPromise me you won't tell a living soul. Tell me you'll die first....\r\nI'm married to Brother I,----, the leader of the ward choir.\"\r\n\r\nIf she asked her mother: \"Tell me. Is plural marriage wrong?\" the mother\r\ncould only reply: \"Oh--I don't know--I don't know. Your father said it\r\nwas right, and I accepted it--and we practiced it--and you have always\r\nloved your other brothers and sisters, and it seems to me it can't be\r\nwrong, since we have lived it. But--Oh, I don't know, daughter. I don't\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who is tempting her knows. He has the word of an apostle, the\r\nexample of the Prophet, the secret teaching of the Church. He courts\r\nher as any other religious young girl might be courted--with little\r\nattentions, at the meetings, over the music books--and he has, to aid\r\nhim, a religious exaltation in her, induced by his plea that she is to\r\nenter into the mystery of the holy covenant, to become one of the most\r\nfaithful of a persecuted Church, to defy the wicked laws of its enemies.\r\nShe is just as happy in her betrothal as any other innocent girl of\r\nher age. Even the secrecy is sweet to her. And then, some evening, they\r\nsaunter down a side street to a strange house--or even to a back\r\norchard where a man is waiting in a cowl under a tree (perhaps vulgarly\r\ndisguised as a woman with a veil over his face)--and they are married in\r\na mutter of which she hears nothing.\r\n\r\nSuch a case was related to me by a horrified mother who had discovered\r\nthat the marriage ceremony had been performed by an accomplice of the\r\nlibertine who had seduced her daughter and since confessed his crime.\r\nBut whether the ceremony be performed by a priest of the Church or by\r\na more unauthorized scoundrel, the girl is equally at the mercy of her\r\n\"husband\" and equally betrayed in the world. Even in this case of the\r\npretended marriage, the elders of the ward hushed up the threatened\r\nprosecution because the authorities of the Church objected to a\r\nproceeding that might expose other plural marriages more orthodox.\r\n\r\nHundreds of Mormon men and women personally thanked me by letter or in\r\ninterviews at the Tribune office, for our editorial attacks upon the\r\nhierarchy for encouraging these horrors. Strangers spoke to me on\r\nrailroad trains, thanking me and telling me of cases. Three Mormon\r\nphysicians, themselves priests of the Church, told me of innumerable\r\ninstances that had come to them in their practice, and said that they\r\ndid not know what was to become of the community. One Mormon woman wrote\r\nme from Mexico to say that she had exiled herself there with her\r\nhusband and his two plural wives, and that she felt she had worked out\r\nsufficient atonement for all her descendants; yet she saw girls of the\r\nfamily on the verge of entering into plural marriage--if they had not\r\nalready done so--and she begged us to continue our newspaper exposures,\r\nso that others might be saved from the bitter experiences of her life.\r\n\r\nPresident Winder met me on the street in 1905, towards the close of the\r\nyear, and said: \"Frank, you need not continue your fight against plural\r\nmarriage. President Smith has stopped it.\" \"Then,\" I replied, \"two\r\nthings are evident: I have been telling the truth when I said\r\nthat plural marriage had been renewed--in spite of the authorized\r\ndenials--and if President Smith has stopped it now, he has had authority\r\nover it all the time.\"\r\n\r\nTo me, or to any other well-informed citizen of Utah, President Winder's\r\nadmission was not necessary to prove Smith's responsibility. In the\r\nApril conference of 1904, Smith had read an \"official statement,\" signed\r\nby him, prohibiting plural marriages and threatening to excommunicate\r\nany officer or member of the Church who should solemnize one; and this\r\nofficial statement was carried to the Senate committee by Professor\r\nJames E. Talmage, and offered in proof that the Church was keeping its\r\ncovenant.\r\n\r\nFor us, in Utah, the declaration served merely to illuminate the dark\r\nplaces of ecclesiastical bad faith. We knew that from the year 1900\r\ndown, there had never been a sermon preached in any Mormon tabernacle,\r\nby any of the general authorities of the Church, against the practice\r\nof plural marriage, or against the propriety of the practice, or against\r\nthe sanctity of the doctrine. We knew, on the contrary, that upon\r\nnumerous occasions, at funerals and in public assemblages, Joseph F.\r\nSmith and John Henry Smith and others of the hierarchy, had proclaimed\r\nthe doctrine as sacred. We knew that it was still being taught in the\r\nsecret prayer meetings. Practically all the leading authorities of the\r\nChurch were living in plural marriage. Some of them had taken new wives\r\nsince the manifesto. None of them had been actually punished. All were\r\nin high favor. And though Joseph F. Smith denied his responsibility,\r\nevery one knew that none of these things could be, except with his\r\nactive approval.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, for a brief time, while Smoot's case was still before the\r\nSenate, some check was put upon the renewal of polygamy. But, even then,\r\nthere were undoubtedly, occasional marriages allowed, where the parties\r\nwere so situated as to make concealment perfect. And all checks were\r\nwithdrawn when Smoot's case was favorably disposed of, and the Church\r\nfound itself protected by the political power of the administration\r\nat Washington and by a political and financial alliance with \"the\r\nInterests.\"\r\n\r\nToday, in spite of the difficulty of discovering plural marriages,\r\nbecause of the concealments by which they are protected, the Salt Lake\r\nTribune is publishing a list of more than two hundred \"new\" polygamists\r\nwith the dates and circumstances of their marriages; and these are\r\nprobably not one tenth of all the cases. During President Taft's\r\nvisit to Salt Lake City, in 1909, Senator Thomas Kearns, one of the\r\nproprietors of the Tribune, offered to prove to one of the President's\r\nconfidants hundreds of cases of new polygamy, if the President would\r\ndesignate two secret service men to investigate. I believe, from my own\r\nobservation, that there are more plural wives among the Mormons today\r\nthan there were before 1890. Then the young men married early, and were\r\nchiefly monogamists. Now the change in economic conditions has raised\r\nthe age at which men marry; it has made more bachelors than there were\r\nwhen simpler modes of life prevailed. The young women have fewer offers\r\nof marriage, and more of these come from well-to-do polygamists. The\r\ngirls are still taught, as they have always been, that marriage is\r\nnecessary to salvation; and they are betrayed into plural marriage by\r\nnatural conditions as well as by the persuasions of the Church.\r\n\r\nA perfect \"underground\" system has been put in operation for the\r\nprotection of the lawbreakers. If they reside in Utah, they frequently\r\ngo to Canada or to Mexico to be married; and the whole polygamous\r\nparaphernalia can be transported with ease and comfort--the priest who\r\nperforms the ceremony, the husband, sometimes the legal wife to give her\r\nconsent so that she may not be damned, and the young woman whose soul is\r\nto be saved. And this \"underground\" is maintained against the reluctance\r\nof the Mormon people. They aid in it from a kindly feeling toward\r\ntheir fellow-believers--and with some faint thought that perhaps these\r\nwayfarers are being \"persecuted\" but all the time with no personal\r\nsympathy for polygamy. By one sincere word of reprehension from Joseph\r\nF. Smith every \"underground\" station could be abolished, the route could\r\nbe destroyed, and an end could be put to the protection that is, of\r\nitself, an encouragement to polygamous practice. He has never spoken\r\nthat word.\r\n\r\nRecently, the way in which the new polygamy is perpetrated in Utah has\r\nbeen almost officially revealed. A patriarch of the Church, resident\r\nin Davis County, less than fifteen miles from Salt Lake City, had been\r\nsolemnizing these unlawful unions at wholesale. The situation became so\r\nnotorious that the authorities of the Church felt themselves impelled\r\nabout September, 1910, to put restrictions upon his activity. In the\r\ncourse of their investigations they discovered that he did not know the\r\npersons whom he married. They would come to his house, in the evening,\r\nwearing handkerchiefs over their faces; he sat hidden behind a screen in\r\nhis parlor; and under these circumstances the two were declared man\r\nand wife, and were sealed up to everlasting bliss to rule over\r\nprincipalities and kingdoms, with power of endless increase and\r\nprogression. He refused to tell the hierarchy from which one of the\r\nauthorities he had received his endowment to perpetrate these crimes.\r\nHe refused to give the names of any of the victims, claiming that he did\r\nnot know them!\r\n\r\nIt is probable that for a long time plural marriage ceremonies were not\r\nsolemnized within the Salt Lake temple. Now, we know that there have\r\nlately been such marriages in it, and at Manti, and at Logan, and\r\nperhaps also in the temple at St. George. There are cases on record\r\nwhere a man has a wife on one side of the Utah-Colorado line and another\r\nwife across the border. No prosecutions are possible in Utah; for, as\r\nJoseph F. Smith told the Senate committee, the officers of the law\r\nhave too much \"respect\" for the ecclesiastical rulers of the state.\r\nSimilarly, in the surrounding states, the officers show exactly the\r\nsame sort of \"respect\" and for the same reason. They not only know\r\nthe Church's power in local politics, but they see the national\r\nadministration allowing the polygamists and priests of the Church\r\nto select the Federal officials, and they are not eager to rouse a\r\nresentment against themselves, at Washington as well as at home, by\r\nprosecuting polygamous Mormons.\r\n\r\nSome few years ago, Irving Sayford, then representing the Los Angeles\r\nTimes, asked Mr. P. H. Lannan, of the Salt Lake Tribune, why someone did\r\nnot swear out warrants against President Smith for his offenses against\r\nthe law. Mr. Lannan said: \"You mean why don't I do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Mr. Sayford explained, \"I don't mean you particularly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, you do,\" Mr. Lannan said. \"You mean me if you mean anybody. If\r\nit's not my duty, it's no one's duty.... Well, I'll tell you why.... I\r\ndon't make a complaint, because neither the district attorney nor the\r\nprosecuting attorney would entertain it. If he did entertain it and\r\nissued a warrant, the sheriff would refuse to serve the warrant. If the\r\nsheriff served the warrant, there would be no witnesses unless I got\r\nthem. If I could get the witnesses, they wouldn't testify to the facts\r\non the stand. If they did testify to the facts, the jury wouldn't bring\r\nin a verdict of guilty. If the jury did bring in a verdict of guilty,\r\nthe judge would suspend sentence. If the judge did not suspend sentence,\r\nhe would merely fine President Smith, three hundred dollars. And within\r\ntwenty-four hours there would be a procession of Mormons and Gentiles\r\ncrawling on their hands and knees to Church headquarters to offer to pay\r\nthat three hundred dollar fine at a dime apiece.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lannan's statement of the case was later substantiated by an action\r\nof the Salt Lake District Court. Upon the birth of the twelfth child\r\nthat has been borne to President Smith in plural marriage since the\r\nmanifesto of 1890, Charles Mostyn Owen made complaint in the District\r\nCourt at Salt Lake, charging Mr. Smith with a statutory offense. The\r\nDistrict Attorney reduced the charge to \"unlawful cohabitation\" (a\r\nmisdemeanor), without the complainant's consent or knowledge. All the\r\npreliminaries were then graciously arranged and President Smith appeared\r\nin the District Court by appointment. He pleaded guilty. The judge in\r\nsentencing him remarked that as this was the first time he had appeared\r\nbefore the court, he would be fined three hundred dollars, but that\r\nshould he again appear, the penalty might be different. Smith had\r\nalready testified in Washington, before the Senate Committee, to the\r\nbirth of eleven children in plural marriage since he had given his\r\ncovenant to the country to cease living in polygamy; he had practically\r\ndefied the Senate and the United States to punish him; he had said that\r\nhe would \"stand\" his \"chances\" before the law and courts of his own\r\nstate. All of this was well known to the judge who fined him three\r\nhundred dollars--a sum of money scarcely equal to the amount of Smith's\r\nofficial income for the time he was in court!\r\n\r\nA leader of the Church, not long ago, asked me, in private conference,\r\nwhat was the policy of the American party with regard to the new plural\r\nwives and their children. I replied that as far as I knew it, the policy\r\nwas to have the Church accept its responsibility in the matter and give\r\nthe wives and children whatever recognition could be given them by their\r\nreligion. The Church was guilty before God and man of having encouraged\r\nthe awful condition. It was unspeakably cowardly and unfair for the\r\nChurch leaders to put the whole burden of suffering on the helpless\r\nwomen and children; and, moreover, this course was a justification to\r\npolygamists in deserting their wives, on the ground that the Church had\r\nnever sanctioned the relation.\r\n\r\nThis Church leader, himself a new polygamist, answered miserably: \"The\r\nChurch will not let itself be put in such a light before the country.\r\nThat would be to admit that it has been responsible all the time.\"\r\n\r\nI asked: \"Has the Church not been responsible?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied--equivocating--: \"Well, not the Church. The Church has never\r\ntaken a vote on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" I said, \"answers why you have never got redress and never will\r\nget it because you are all liars, from top to bottom. You know you would\r\nnever have entered the polygamous relation--nor could you have induced\r\nyour wife to enter it--except with full knowledge that the Church did\r\nauthorize it. The Church is one man, and you know it. The whole theory\r\nof your theology collapses if you deny that.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head blankly. \"I don't know what is to become of us. I\r\ndon't see any way out.\"\r\n\r\nI could only advise him that he should join with other new polygamists\r\nin demanding that the Church authorities make all possible reparation to\r\nthe women and children who were being crushed under the penalties of the\r\nChurch's crime. But I knew that such advice was vain. He could not make\r\nsuch a demand, any more than any other slave could demand his freedom.\r\nAnd if the non-polygamists demanded it, the Prophets would deny that\r\npolygamy was being practiced. The children could not be legitimized--for\r\nthe Church cannot obtain legitimizing statutes without avowing its\r\nresponsibility for the need of them; and the Gentiles can not pass such\r\nstatutes without encouraging the continuance of polygamy by removing the\r\nsocial penalty against it.\r\n\r\nSo the burden of all this guilt, this shame, this deception, falls upon\r\nthe unfortunate plural wife and her innocent offspring. She is bound by\r\nthe most sacred obligations never to reveal the name of the officiating\r\npriest--even if she knew it--nor to disclose the circumstances of the\r\nceremony. She has justified her degradation by the assumption that God\r\nhas commanded it; that her husband has received a revelation authorizing\r\nhim to take her into his household; that her children will be legitimate\r\nin the sight of God, and that eventually the civilized world will come\r\nto a joyous acceptance of the practice of polygamy. When the trials of\r\nher life afflict her and she finds no relentment in the world's disdain,\r\nshe sees no avenue of retreat. To break the relation is to imply at once\r\nthat it was not ordained of God, and to cast a darker ignominy upon her\r\nunfortunate children. Her only hope lies in her continued submission\r\nto her husband and his Church, even after she has mentally and morally\r\nrejected the doctrine that betrayed her. A more pitiably helpless band\r\nof self-immolants than these Mormon women has never suffered martyrdom\r\nin the history of the world. Heaven help them. There is no help for them\r\non earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII. The Prophet of Mammon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an earlier day among the Mormons, the ecclesiastical authorities\r\ncollected one-tenth of the \"annual increase\" of the faithful into \"the\r\nstorehouse of the Lord;\" and this was practically the entire assessment\r\nmade by the Church; although, by the same law of tithing, every Mormon\r\nwas held obliged to consecrate all his earthly possessions to \"God's\r\nwork\" on the demand of the Prophet. The common fund was used, then, to\r\npromote community enterprises and to relieve the poor. The tithe-payer\r\nsaw the good result of the administration of the Church's moneys, and\r\nwas generally satisfied. He was promised eternal happiness if he paid\r\nan honest tithe, but he was also given an earthly reward--for the\r\nChurch admitted him to many opportunities and enterprises from which\r\nthe niggardly were adroitly excluded. He was spiritually elevated\r\nand enlarged by giving for a purpose that he considered worthy--the\r\nfulfillment of a commandment of God and the relief of his\r\nfellow-creatures--and the community benefited by having a part of its\r\nyearly surplus administered for the common good.\r\n\r\nBut by the time the Church had reached its third generation of\r\ntithe-payers, the \"financial Prophets\" had made a change. On the theory\r\nthat since the Mormons were paying the bulk of the taxes, they should\r\nshare in the distribution of the public relief funds, the Mormon poor\r\nwere denied assistance from \"the storehouse of the Lord,\" and were\r\ncompelled to enter the poorhouses, to seek shelter on the \"county\r\nfarms,\" or to take charity from their neighbors. The resulting\r\ndegradation of a sublime principle of human helpfulness is strikingly\r\nshown in the fact that in some cases, where the county relief funds are\r\ndistributed through a Mormon clerk of paupers for out-door relief, the\r\nMormon bishop even collects one-tenth of this money, from the wretched\r\nrecipients, as their contribution to God Almighty!\r\n\r\nNor is the greed of the present hierarchy satisfied with one-tenth of a\r\nMormon's income. Said Joseph F. Smith, at the April Conference of 1899\r\n(according to the Church's official report): \"If a farmer raises two\r\nthousand bushels of wheat, as the result of his year's labor, how\r\nmany bushels should he pay for tithing? Well, some go straightway to\r\ndickering with the Lord. They will say that they hired a man so and\r\nso, and his wages must be taken out; that they had to pay such and such\r\nexpenses, and this cost and that cost; and they reckon out all their\r\nexpenses and tithe the balance.\" To Smith's inspired financial genius\r\nthis was \"dickering with the Lord.\" He wished to collect ten per cent of\r\nthe farmer's entire yield--a tithe that would have bankrupted the farmer\r\nin three years!\r\n\r\nNor is the tithe any longer the only exaction demanded by the Prophet.\r\nA score of \"donations\" have been added. There is the Stake Tabernacle\r\nDonation, which is a fund collected from the Mormons of each \"Stake\"\r\n(corresponding usually to a county) for the building of a house in which\r\nto hold Stake Conferences. There is the Ward Meeting-House Donation,\r\nwhich is a fund collected from the Mormons of every \"ward\" for the\r\nerection of a local chapel. There is the Fast Day Donation, made up\r\nof contributions gathered on the afternoon of the first Sunday of each\r\nmonth, at what is called \"a fast meeting,\" for the support of the local\r\npoor; and this is supplemented by the Relief Society Donation, solicited\r\nby the members of the Ladies Relief Society, in a house-to-house\r\ncanvass, from Mormons and Gentiles alike. A Light and Heat Donation is\r\ncollected by the deacons of the ward, under direction of the bishop, to\r\npay for the lighting and heating of the ward meeting house; a Missionary\r\nDonation is collected at a \"Missionary benefit entertainment,\" to help\r\ndefray the expenses of a member of a ward sent on a mission; and since a\r\nmissionary must necessarily be an elder, a Quorum Missionary Donation is\r\nalso taken from his fellow members of the quorum, to assist him. So\r\nfar as the Church is concerned, he travels \"without purse or scrip,\" by\r\norder of \"revelation;\" but this inhibition does not extend to the use of\r\nhis own money--if he has any left after paying the other exaction's--nor\r\ndoes it prevent him either from receiving contributions from his\r\nimpoverished fellows or accepting charity from \"the enemies of God's\r\npeople,\" whom he labors to redeem. And on these terms about ninety per\r\ncent. of the adult male Mormons perform missionary services for the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nAll priesthood quorums have monthly Quorum Dues collected from their\r\nmembers. On one Sunday of each month, called Nickel Sunday, the Sunday\r\nSchool members pay in five cents each for the purchase of new books,\r\netc. On Dime Tuesday, once a month, the members of the Young Men's and\r\nthe Young Women's Mutual Improvement Associations pay in ten cents each\r\nfor the purchase of books, etc. On Nickel Friday, once a month, the\r\ninfant members of the Primary Association pay in five cents each to\r\nthe association. Religious Class Donations are paid once a month by the\r\nMormon public-school pupils for the support of the week-day religious\r\nclasses. Amusement Hall Donations are collected from the members of a\r\nward whose bishop finds them able to build a place of amusement. When a\r\ntemple is to be erected, Temple Donations are collected, continuously,\r\nuntil the work is finished and paid for; and when members of the Church\r\n\"go through the Temple,\" they are required to pay another form of Temple\r\nDonation in any sum that they can afford. Should a need arise, not\r\nprovided for by the specific donations given above, a Special Donation\r\nis collected to meet it. Yet in the face of all these exaction's of\r\ntithes and donations, the ecclesiast still boasts: \"We are not like the\r\n'preachers for hire and diviners for money.' We never pass the plate\r\nat our sacred services. Our clergy labor, without pay, to give free\r\nsalvation to a sinful world!\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to doing missionary service, paying tithes, and contributing\r\ndonations, the latter-day Mormon, if he be obedient to the counsel\r\nof the Church's anointed financiers, must support the commercial and\r\nfinancial undertakings of the hierarchy. These are officially designated\r\n\"the Church's institutions\" by the authorities; but they are in no\r\nway the property of the Church. They are advertised as community\r\nenterprises, but they are such only in the sense that the community is\r\ncommanded by \"the voice of God\" to sustain them. There is no voice of\r\nGod to command a distribution of their profits. And they are no longer\r\nconducted for the benefit of the community but to exploit it.\r\n\r\nThe good Mormon must purchase his sugar from \"the Church's\" sugar\r\ncompany (Joseph F. Smith, president), which is controlled by the\r\nnational sugar trust and charges trust prices. He must buy salt from\r\n\"the Church's\" salt monopoly (Joseph F. Smith, president), which is a\r\npart of, and pays dividends to, the national salt trust. He is taught to\r\ngo for his merchandise to the Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution\r\n(Joseph F. Smith, president), where even whiskey is sold under the\r\nsymbol of the All-seeing Eye and the words \"Holiness to the Lord\" in\r\ngilt letters; and Joseph F. Smith, at the April Conference, of 1898\r\n(according to the Church's official report), scolded those \"pretendedly\r\npious\" Mormons who \"were shocked and horrified\" to find \"liquid poison\"\r\nsold under these auspices--for, as Smith argued, with characteristic\r\ngreed, if the Mormon who wanted whiskey could not get it in the Church\r\nstore, \"he would not patronize Z.C.M.I. at all, but would go elsewhere\r\nto deal!\"\r\n\r\nThe farmers are \"counselled\" to buy their vehicles from \"the Church's\"\r\nfirm, the Consolidated Wagon and Machine Company (Joseph F. Smith,\r\npresident); to take out their fire insurance with the Church's \"Home\r\nFire Insurance Company\" (Joseph F. Smith, controller); and to insure\r\ntheir lives with the Church's \"Beneficial Life Insurance Company\"\r\n(Joseph F. Smith, president). The Salt Lake Knitting Company (of which\r\nJoseph F. Smith is president) makes, among other things, the sacred\r\nknitted garments that are prescribed for every Mormon who takes the\r\n\"Endowment Oaths,\" to be worn by him forever after as a shield \"against\r\nthe Adversary;\" and these garments bear the label: \"Approved by the\r\nPresidency. No knitted garment approved which does not bear this label.\"\r\nBy which ingenious bit of religious commercialism, the sacred marks\r\non the garments (accepted as a sort of passport to Heaven) have been\r\nincreased by the sacred Smith trademark that admits the wearer to the\r\nSmith Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Church's banking institutions, of which Joseph F. Smith is\r\npresident, are recommended as safer than others because the money goes\r\ninto the hands of \"the brethren.\" Church newspapers must be subscribed\r\nfor, because all others are \"unreliable\"--although the Church's Deseret\r\nNews (Joseph F. Smith, president) is one of the most dishonest, unjust\r\nand mendacious organs that ever poisoned the public mind. And so\r\non, through the whole list of business concerns by which the Church\r\nauthorities are to profit. The Mormons, having learned of old the value\r\nof a solid, community support for community enterprises established\r\nin the interests of the community, are still kept solidly supporting\r\necclesiastical enterprises administered for the benefit of the hierarchy\r\nor its favorites, at the community's expense!\r\n\r\nThe Utah Light and Railway Company (Joseph F. Smith, president), which\r\nwas supported by the tithes of the Mormon people, was charging $1.25 per\r\nthousand cubic feet for fuel gas and $1.75 for illuminating gas, just\r\nbefore the company was sold to the \"Harriman interests.\" (The Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States has fixed a rate of 80 cents a thousand as\r\na fair price for gas in New York City.) The Salt Lake Street Railway\r\n(operating under a fifty-year franchise, obtained from the City Council\r\nby, the power of the Church while Joseph F. Smith was president of the\r\ncompany) charges a five-cent fare, gives but one transfer, allows no\r\nhalf fares for children, and pays the city nothing for the use of its\r\nstreets. Before the transfer of the Church's sugar stocks to the trust,\r\nthe sugar factories paid the farmer $4.50 a ton for his beets and sold\r\nhim sugar for $4.50 a hundred pounds; today beets are bought for $4.50\r\na ton, and sugar sold at $6.00 a hundred. The price asked for salt in\r\nUtah, where it should be \"dirt cheap,\" is the same as everywhere under\r\nthe salt trust. And so on--through the rest of the list.\r\n\r\nTo maintain this system of sanctified gain Joseph F. Smith invokes all\r\nthe power of his \"divine\" authority as \"the mouthpiece of the Lord.\" He\r\nprotects the sugar trust by preventing the establishment of independent\r\nsugar factories (as for example in Sanpete and Sevier counties in 1905),\r\njust as he protects the salt trust by preventing the competition of\r\nindependent salt gardens (as in the case of Smurthwaite and Taylor.) He\r\nissues his edict of protection as \"the vicegerent of God on Earth\" to\r\nthe Mormons; and he excommunicates and ostracizes, in this world and the\r\nnext, the Mormon protestant who dares rebel against commercial monopoly.\r\n\r\nHe receives between two and three million dollars a year in tithes,\r\ngives no accounting of them, and has no responsibility for them, except\r\nto God and his own conscience. He is able to use this sum, in bulk,\r\nat any given point, with a weight of financial pressure that would\r\noverbalance any other such single power in the community. As \"trustee in\r\ntrust\" for the Church, he has the added income from stocks and previous\r\ninvestments; and he has practical control of the wealth of all the\r\nleading men of the Church to assist him, if he should call upon them\r\nfor assistance. He uses his financial dictatorship to support monopoly\r\nagainst the assault of Gentile opposition, and he compels the Gentile to\r\npay tribute as the Mormon does.\r\n\r\nHe backs his financial power with his control of legislation. He can not\r\nonly prevent the passage of any laws against his favored monopolies,\r\nbut (as in the case of the smelters) he can reduce independents to\r\nsubmission by threatening them with procured laws to penalize them. He\r\nlargely controls the \"labor troubles\" of the State by controlling the\r\nobedience of the Mormon laboring men. He can influence judges, officers\r\nof the law and all the agents of local government by his power\r\nas political \"Boss,\" and the same influence extends, through his\r\nrepresentatives at Washington, to the local activities of Federal\r\nauthority. He can check and govern public opinion among his subjects by\r\nannouncing \"the will of God\" to them through the officers of the Church\r\nin every department of religious administration. He is, therefore, at\r\nonce the modern \"money king,\" the absolute political Czar the social\r\ndespot and the infallible Pope of his \"Kingdom!\"\r\n\r\nJust as men fight for the retention of a throne and the maintenance of\r\na dynasty, so he and his courtiers defend his rule and maintain his\r\nautocracy with every weapon of absolutism. And just as royalty, while\r\npossessed of unlimited wealth, has never lacked mercenaries, press\r\nbureaus, and all the sycophantic defenders of a crown, so Smith is\r\nable to command an array of service as great as any ever brought to\r\nthe defense of a social system. This singular and enormous power stands\r\nsolidly against any movement of domestic reform; and, by its alliance\r\nwith the national rulers in finance and politics, it is saved from the\r\ndanger of \"foreign\" intervention. Like every other such absolutism, it\r\nis crushing out the life of its subjects; for, in spite of the industry,\r\nthe thrift, and the abstemiousness of the Mormon people, they are\r\nsinking under the burden of imposed exaction's. Although Utah became a\r\nterritory in 1853, and had its well-settled towns at that time, and was\r\norganized in a compact social body for the upbuilding of its material\r\nprosperity before any of the surrounding states had received an organic\r\nact as a territory, Utah has now lost its leadership, and the individual\r\ninitiative and enterprise of the typical Western community have been\r\nrelatively lost.\r\n\r\nIn this process of degeneration, one of the most promising modern\r\nexperiments in communism has been frustrated and brought to ruin. In the\r\nearly nineties, Dr. Josiah Strong, of New York City, viewed the Mormon\r\nsystem with an interested admiration. He saw that by contribution, and\r\nco-operation, and arbitration, the energies of the people were conserved\r\nand the products of their prosperity more equally distributed than under\r\nthe conditions of economic war then prevalent elsewhere. He thought he\r\nsaw in Utah a possible solution of some of the social problems of our\r\ncivilization. But, a few years ago, he confessed that the Mormon system\r\nwas no longer worthy of study. It had been destroyed by the greed of\r\nits rulers. Community contributions were being used for individual\r\ncommercialism and the aggrandizement of leaders. The aged and infirm\r\npoor, who had contributed through all the working period of their\r\nlives, were being thrust into poor houses. The ambition of the earlier\r\nProphets, to make the people great in their community prosperity and\r\nhappiness, has been lost in the new desire of the head of the Church\r\nto exhibit that greatness only in his own person. The Mormon people had\r\nbecome the working slaves of a financial and political and religious\r\nautocracy, and Mormonism was no longer anything but a hopeless failure\r\nas a social experiment.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say how much of this failure was due to the character\r\nof the present Prophet, and how much to the national conditions that\r\nare threatening the success of democracy in every state of the Union.\r\nIt would seem that the conditions were ideal for the production of\r\njust such a man as Smith, and that Smith was by nature fitted for the\r\ngreatest growth under just such conditions. He came to power with none\r\nof the feeling of responsibility to his people which the earlier leaders\r\nshowed. He considered that the people lived for him, not that he lived\r\nfor the people. He regarded the Mormon system as an establishment of his\r\nfamily, to which he had the family right of inheritance; and he waited\r\nwith a sulky impatience for the deaths of the men who stood between him\r\nand the control of his family's Church. It was as if he accepted his\r\npredecessors as exercising their powers, during an inter-regnum, by the\r\nconsent of the Mormon people, but saw himself acceding to the throne by\r\nfamily right and the order of divinity.\r\n\r\nHe had no financial ability; he had no considerable property when he\r\nbecame president of the Church at sixty-three. Nor did he need any\r\nsuch ability. The continuous inflow of money--to be used without\r\naccountability to anyone--and the wealth of opportunity offered by the\r\nmen who wished his aid in exploiting his people, made it unnecessary\r\nthat he should have any creative financial vision. He needed only to\r\nmove, with his opportunity, along the line of least resistance which was\r\nalso, with him, the line of choice.\r\n\r\nHe had, through all his years, shown an obvious envy of any member of\r\nthe Church whose circumstances were better than his own. It was apparent\r\nin his manner that he regarded such success in the community as an\r\nencroachment upon the Smith prerogatives. As soon as he came to power,\r\nhe accepted every opportunity of self-aggrandizement as a new Smith\r\nprerogative. And the system of modern capitalism appealed at once to\r\nhis ambition. By the older method of tithes and conscription's, he could\r\ncollect only from the devotees of the Church; by the larger exploitation\r\nhe could levy tribute upon the Gentiles too.\r\n\r\nAnd he was aided by the Mormons themselves. They had been brought\r\ntogether, in obedience to \"a command of God,\" in order that the\r\ncommunity, by avoiding the sins of the world, might be saved from the\r\nplagues that were to descend upon the world because of its injustice.\r\nThey were a credulous people, ignorant of the sins of modern finance,\r\nand prepared by industry and isolation to be exploited. Their previous\r\nleaders had observed, as a warning only, the modern aspiration for\r\nvast wealth obtained by economic injustice; but that aspiration made an\r\ninstant appeal to Smith's ambition; and it is the peculiar iniquity of\r\nconditions in Utah today that his ambition has betrayed his people to\r\nthe very evils which they were originally organized to escape.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier time it was the pride of the leader that the community in\r\nthe large was advancing and the average of conditions improving. Today\r\nthe leader assumes that as he grows richer the people are prospering and\r\n\"the revelations of God\" being vindicated in practice. He speaks with\r\npride of \"our\" growth and wealth under \"the benign authority of the\r\nAlmighty\" and His \"temporal revelations\"--because he himself has been\r\nenriched by the perversion of these same laws--very much as the \"captain\r\nof industry\" elsewhere boasts of the \"prosperity\" of the country,\r\nbecause the few are growing so rich at the expense of the many.\r\n\r\nAlong with this strain of commercial greed in Smith, there is an equally\r\nstrong strain of religious fanaticism that justifies the greed and\r\nsanctifies it, to itself. He believes (as Apostle Orson Pratt taught, by\r\nauthority of the Church): \"The Kingdom of God is an order of government\r\nestablished by divine authority. It is the only legal government that\r\ncan exist in any part of the universe. All other governments are illegal\r\nand unauthorized.... Any people attempting to govern themselves by laws\r\nof their own making, and by officers of their own appointment, are in\r\ndirect rebellion against the Kingdom of God.\" Smith believes that over\r\nthis Kingdom the Smiths have been, by Divine revelation, ordained to\r\nrule. He believes that his authority is the absolute and unquestionable\r\nauthority of God Himself. He believes that in all the affairs of life\r\nhe has the same right over his subjects that the Creator has over His\r\ncreatures. He believes that he has been appointed to use the Mormon\r\npeople as he in his inspired wisdom sees fit to use them, in order the\r\nmore firmly to establish God's Kingdom on Earth against the Powers of\r\nEvil.\r\n\r\nHe believes that the people of the American Republic, \"being governed by\r\nlaws of their own making and by officers of their own appointment,\" are\r\nin direct rebellion against \"his Kingdom of God.\" He believes that the\r\nnational government is destined to be broken in pieces by his power;\r\nthat it has only been preserved from destruction by the concessions\r\nrecently made by the Federal authorities; and that it can only continue\r\nto save itself so long as it shall recognize Smith's ambassadors at\r\nWashington--and so allow him to work out its destruction in the fullness\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nBut with all this insanity of pretension he has a sort of cowardly\r\nshrewdness, acquired in his days of hiding \"on the underground.\" On\r\nthe witness stand in Washington he denied that he had had any direct\r\ncommunication with God by revelation; and then he returned to Utah and\r\npleaded from the pulpit that on this point he had lied in Washington in\r\norder to escape saying what his \"inquisitors\" had wished him to say in\r\norder to \"get him into a trap.\" He preaches in Utah that to deny the\r\ndoctrine of polygamy is to reject the teaching of Jesus Christ; before\r\nthe Senate committee he was coward enough to put the blame of his\r\npolygamous cohabitation upon his five wives. In Washington he claimed\r\nthat the Gentiles of Utah condoned polygamous cohabitation and had a\r\nliberal sympathy for the Church; but at St. George, Utah, for example\r\n(in September, 1904), he was reported by a Church newspaper as saying:\r\n\"The Gentiles are coming among us to buy our homes and land. We should\r\nnot sell to them, as they are the enemies of the Kingdom of God.\" He is\r\nthat most perfect of all hypocrites--the fanatic who believes that he is\r\nlying in the service of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring of 1888, I was in Washington, where measures of\r\nproscription were then being prepared against our people; and, early in\r\nthe morning, as I walked up Massachusetts Avenue, I saw Joseph F. Smith\r\napproaching me. For several years he had been \"on the underground\" under\r\nthe name of \"Joseph Mack\"--now in the Hawaiian Islands with one wife;\r\nnow hidden, with another, among the faithful in some Mormon village; or\r\nagain with a third, in Washington (which was probably as safe a place as\r\nany) presiding secretly over the Church lobby. As he passed me, with\r\nhis head down, preoccupied, I said: \"Good morning, President Smith.\"\r\nHe jumped as if I had been a Deputy Marshal with such a sudden start of\r\nfear that his silk hat rolled on the pavement and his umbrella dropped\r\nfrom his hand. He drew back from me as if he were about to take to his\r\nheels. Then he recognized me, of course, and was quickly reassured; but\r\nhis embarrassment continued for some time, awkwardly.\r\n\r\nBut a short time ago the President of the United States stood in the\r\nSalt Lake Tabernacle (which is \"Joseph Mack's\" capitol and vatican) and\r\naddressed a multitude that had assembled not more to honor the Chief\r\nExecutive of the nation than to pay their almost idolatrous tribute\r\nof devotion to the head of their Church, who was reigning there in\r\nthe pulpit with President Taft. \"Joseph Mack\" no longer fears Deputy\r\nMarshals--he appoints them; and the present United States Marshal of\r\nUtah would refuse to serve a paper under the direction of the entire\r\npower of the United States government if \"Joseph Mack\" forbade the\r\nservice. He no longer fears the proscriptions of legislators at\r\nWashington; they come to him, through the leaders of their parties,\r\nand arrange with him for the support of the trans-Mississippi states in\r\nwhich the influence of his Church control is determinative. He no longer\r\nhides his wives, at the ends of the earth, and visits them by stealth;\r\nthey occupy a row of houses along one of the principal streets of Salt\r\nLake City, and the pilgrim and the tourist alike admire his magnificence\r\nas they go by. He is still a law-breaker. He stands even more in\r\ndefiance of the authority of the nation than he did in 1888, and he\r\nhates that authority as much as ever. But he is today not only the\r\nProphet of the Church; he is the Prophet of Mammon; and all the powers\r\nand principalities of Mammon now give him gloriously: \"All Hail!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX. The Subjects of the Kingdom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what of the Mormon people? How can such leaders, directing the\r\nChurch to purposes that have become so cruel, so selfish, so dangerous\r\nand so disloyal--how can they maintain their power over followers who\r\nare themselves neither criminal nor degraded? That is a question which\r\nhas given the pause of doubt to many criticisms of the Mormon communism\r\nof our day. That is the consideration which has obtained from the nation\r\nthe protection of tolerance under which the Prophets flourish. For not\r\nonly are the Mormon men and women obviously as worthy as any in the\r\nUnited States: there is plainly much of community value in their social\r\nlife; there is manifestly a great deal of efficiency for human good in\r\ntheir system and in the leadership by which it is directed; and this\r\ngood is so apparent that it appeals easily to the sympathetic conscience\r\nand uninformed mind of the country at large.\r\n\r\nLet me try, then, to exhibit and to analyze the causes that keep such a\r\nvirtuous and sturdy people loyally supporting the leadership of men so\r\nunworthy of them that if the people were as bad as the ends to which\r\nthey are being now directed, modern Mormonism would be destroyed by its\r\nown evils.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the average Mormon chief is sincere in his\r\npretensions and self-justified in his aims. Usually, he has been born,\r\nin the Church, to a family that sees itself set apart, in holiness, from\r\nthe rest of humanity, as the direct heirs of the ancient prophets or\r\neven as the lineal descendants of Christ. From his earliest age of\r\nunderstanding, he is taught the divine splendor of his birth and\r\nimpressed with the high duties of his family privilege in being\r\npermitted to bear a part in preparing the earth for the second coming\r\nof the Savior. He is taught that, though all the world may be saved and\r\nnearly all the people of this sphere will in some eternity work out\r\na measure of salvation, he and 143,999 others are to be a band of the\r\nelect who shall stand about the Savior, on Mount Zion, in the final day.\r\n\r\nHe is taught that, next to Christ, Joseph Smith, the founder of the\r\nfaith, has performed the largest mission for the salvation of the world;\r\nthat in the councils of the Gods, when the Creator measured off the\r\nages of the human race on this earth, to the Savior was apportioned \"the\r\nmeridian of time,\" and to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, was given the\r\n\"last dispensation,\" which is \"the fullness of times,\" in order that the\r\nworld, having apostatized from the atonement and the redemption, might\r\nbe saved to heaven by Joseph, \"the Choice Seer.\"\r\n\r\nHe is taught that the disciples of the Mormon Prophet are literally the\r\ndisciples of Jesus Christ; that the laws of right and wrong are within\r\nthe direction and subject to the authority of the Prophet, to be\r\nchanged, enlarged or even revoked by his commandment; that all human\r\nlaws are equally subject to his will, to be made or unmade at his order;\r\nthat he can condemn, by his excommunication, any man or any nation\r\nto the vengeance of the Almighty here and hereafter; and that he can\r\npronounce a blessing upon the head of any man, or the career of any\r\npeople, by virtue of which blessing power shall be held in this world\r\nrighteously and the man elevated to sit at the right hand of God in\r\nthe world to come. He is taught that the greatest sin which can be\r\ncommitted--next to the denial of Christ--is to raise hand or voice\r\nagainst \"the Lord's anointed,\" the Mormon prophets. And, for morality,\r\nhe is taught from his infancy, that he must scrupulously practice those\r\nspecial virtues of his cult, industry, thrift, purity (except as in\r\nlater life he shall be inducted into the practice of the new polygamy)\r\nhonesty in business, and charity toward his needy fellow-men.\r\n\r\nFormed in character by this teaching, as a steady inculcation throughout\r\nhis youth, he comes to manhood strong of body, determined of mind,\r\npracticing rigidly and intolerantly his petty virtues of abstinence from\r\nthe use of tobacco, tea and coffee, proclaiming with fanatical zeal the\r\ngospel as it has been proclaimed to him, and self-justified in all that\r\nhe says or does by the large measure of sincerity in his delusions.\r\n\r\nAnd that is, in some degree, the common training of all Mormons. Every\r\nMormon boy attends Sunday School as soon as he is old enough to lisp his\r\nsong of adoration to Joseph, the Kingly Prophet, and to the Savior with\r\nwhom Joseph is early associated in his childish mind. At six years of\r\nage, he enters the Primary Association; at twelve he is in the Young\r\nMen's Mutual Improvement Association; at fourteen or even earlier, he\r\nstands in the fast-day meeting and repeats like a creed: \"Brethren and\r\nSisters, I feel called upon to say a few words. I am not able to edify\r\nyou, but I can say that I know this is the Church and Kingdom of God,\r\nand I bear my testimony that Joseph Smith was a Prophet and that Brigham\r\nYoung was his lawful successor, and that the Prophet Joseph F. Smith is\r\nheir to all the authority which the Lord has conferred in these days\r\nfor the salvation of men. And I feel that if I live my religion and do\r\nnothing to offend the Holy Spirit I will be saved in the presence of my\r\nFather and His Son, Jesus Christ. With these few words I will give way.\r\nPraying the Lord to bless each and every one of us is my prayer in the\r\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nAt fourteen he becomes a Deacon of the Church. Between that age and\r\ntwenty, he becomes an Elder. Very soon thereafter he becomes \"a Seventy\"\r\nand perhaps a high priest. He takes upon himself \"covenants in holy\r\nplaces.\" He becomes \"a priest unto the Most High God\"--frequently before\r\nhis eighteenth year. Usually before he is twenty he is sent on a mission\r\nto proclaim his gospel--the only one he has ever heard in his life--to\r\n\"an unenlightened nation\" and \"a wicked world.\" For, in addition\r\nto being taught that the Mormons are the best, most virtuous, most\r\ntemperate, most industrious, and most God-fearing of all peoples--a\r\nthing that is dinned into his ears from the pulpit every Sunday in the\r\nyear--he has been convinced by equal iteration that the rest of the\r\nworld is a festering mass of corruption.\r\n\r\nOften he goes abroad, to some country whose language and customs he\r\nmust learn and upon the charity of whose toilers he must depend for his\r\nmaintenance. He goes with an implicit reliance upon God, strong in the\r\nsmall virtues that have been taught him from the time he knelt at his\r\nmother's knee. He sees, probably for the first time, the afflictions\r\nand the sins among mankind; and he keeps himself unspotted from them,\r\ncongratulating himself that these grossnesses are unknown to his\r\nsheltered home-life and to the religion which he holds as the ideal of\r\nhis soul. He proclaims his belief that God has spoken from the Heavens,\r\nthrough the Mormon Prophet, in this last day, to restore the gospel\r\nof Christ from which the peoples of the earth have wandered. He \"bears\r\ntestimony\" to the whole world, and he binds himself to the authority of\r\nhis Church by proclaiming his belief in it.\r\n\r\nWhen he returns home, after years of service, he is called to the stand\r\nin the tabernacle to give a report of his work. He finds waiting for him\r\na ready advancement in the offices of the Church, according as he may\r\nshow himself worthy of advancement or as the power of family or the\r\nfavor of ecclesiastical authority may obtain it for him. He marries a\r\ngirl who has had a training almost identical with his own. She, too, has\r\nborne her testimony before she reached years of responsibility. She has\r\ntaken her vows as a priestess at the age when he was dedicating himself\r\na priest. She may even have performed a foreign mission. They have both\r\nbeen promised that they shall become kings and queens in the eternal\r\nworld. They are bound by their covenants to obey their superior priests.\r\nThey cannot disregard their Church affiliations without recanting\r\ntheir vows. The only way they can adhere to their covenants with their\r\nAlmighty Father--the only way they can demonstrate their acceptance\r\nof the atoning power of the Redeemer's sacrifice--is by yielding such\r\nobedience to the Prophet as they would pay to the Father and the Son\r\nif They were on earth in Their proper persons. To deviate from this\r\nfaithfulness is to be marked as a Judas Iscariot by all the Latter-Day\r\nSaints.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Mormon becomes the head of a family--in addition to all\r\nthe testimonies and performances which he must give as proof of his\r\ncontinued adherence--he must submit himself and his household to the\r\nexamination and espionage of the ward teachers, who invade his home\r\nat least once a month. They enter absolutely as the proprietors of the\r\nhouse. If the husband is there, they ask him whether he performs\r\nhis duties in the Church; whether he holds family prayer morning and\r\nevening; whether he \"keeps the word of wisdom\"--that is, does he abstain\r\nfrom the use of alcohol, tobacco, tea and coffee--whether he pays a full\r\ntithe and all the prescribed donations to the Church; whether he has any\r\nhard feelings against any of his brethren and sisters; and finally,\r\ndoes he devoutly sustain the Prophet as the ruler of God's Kingdom upon\r\nearth. These questions, so far as they apply, are put to each member of\r\nthe family above the age of eight years. Should the husband be away, all\r\nthe inquiries concerning him are made of the wife. If both parents are\r\nabsent, the questions concerning them are put to their children!\r\n\r\nThis one branch of the ecclesiastical service is sufficient of itself\r\nto mark the Mormon Church as the most perfectly disciplined institution\r\namong mankind. The teachers' quorum in any neighborhood consists of some\r\ntried elders, usually of considerable ability and experience. With these\r\nare associated numerous young men, many of them returned missionaries.\r\nThe fact that they have countless other duties in the Church and many\r\nother and weightier responsibilities, is not permitted to excuse them\r\nfrom performing strictly this important labor. Perhaps a dozen or twenty\r\nfamilies are assigned to a couple of teachers. They are required to\r\nvisit each of these families once every month. And if they discover any\r\nlapse of fidelity, they report at once to the Bishop.\r\n\r\nNo one who has not seen them on their rounds will believe with what an\r\nair of divinely privileged authority they enter a home and force its\r\nsecrets of conscience--with what an imposing and arrogant zeal--with\r\nwhat a calm assumption of spiritual over-lordship and inquisitorial\r\nright. Some few years ago after my public criticisms of Joseph F. Smith\r\nhad been followed by my excommunication, two teachers, on their monthly\r\nrounds, came to my home in the evening and made their way calmly to the\r\nlibrary where I was sitting with some members of my family. I had just\r\nreturned from a long absence abroad, and the visit was an untimely\r\nintrusion at its best; but we observed the obligations of hospitality\r\nwith what courtesy we could, and merely evaded the familiar questions\r\nwhich they began to put to us. Finally, the elder of the two teachers,\r\na man of some local prominence in the Church, undertook to \"bear\r\ntestimony\" to the wickedness of anyone who opposed the divine rule of\r\nJoseph F. Smith; and when I cut him short with a request that he leave\r\nthe house, he was as shocked and surprised as if he had been Milton's\r\nArchangel Michael, after \"the fall,\" and I, a defiant Adam, showing him\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the visitations of the ward teachers, some members of the\r\nLadies Relief Society call upon every family usually once a month, not\r\nonly to gather donations for the poor, but to have a little quiet talk\r\nwith the wife and mother of the household. These women of the Relief\r\nSociety are genuine \"Sisters of Charity.\" In most cases they have\r\nthemselves plenty of household cares, yet they give much of their time\r\nto visiting the sick, supplying the wants of the needy or ministering\r\nto the miseries of the afflicted; and if it were not for them and their\r\nnoblework, the Mormon poor would fare ill in these days of Mormon Church\r\ngrandeur. Outside of their monthly visitations, they have definite\r\npreaching to do. At the meetings of their organization, they \"bear\r\ntestimony\" that Joseph was a Prophet--and so on. They have the quarterly\r\nstake conferences to attend. Their traveling missionaries go from Salt\r\nLake to the four quarters of the globe to institute and maintain the\r\ndiscipline of the organization and to teach the methods of its practical\r\nwork in Nursing Schools, mother's classes and the like. They make up one\r\nof the noblest bodies of women associated with any social movement of\r\nhumanity. And in their zeal and submissiveness they are so innocently\r\nmeek and \"biddable\" that they can listen with reverence to young Hyrum\r\nSmith publicly lecturing the grandmothers of the order for occasionally\r\npartaking of a cup of thin tea.\r\n\r\nUnder such a system of teaching, discipline and espionage, how can\r\nthe average Mormon man or woman develop any independence of thought\r\nor action? At what time of life can he assert himself? Before he has\r\nattained the age of reason he has declared his faith in public. If he\r\nshall then, in his teens, express any doubt, the priests are ready for\r\nhim. \"You have borne your testimony many times in the Church,\" they\r\nsay sternly. \"Were you lying then, or have you lost the Spirit of\r\nGod through your transgressions?\" If he reveals any doubt to the ward\r\nteachers, they will overwhelm him with argument, and either absolutely\r\nreconvert him or silence him with authority. The pressure of family\r\nlove and pride will be brought to bear upon him. The ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities will move against him. He knows that every one of his\r\nrelatives will be humiliated by his unfaithfulness. His \"sin\" will\r\nbecome known to the whole community, and he will be looked at askance by\r\nhis friends and his companions.\r\n\r\nAfter he has taken his vows as a priest, how shall he dare to violate\r\nthem? He knows that if he loses his faith on a mission--in other words,\r\nif he dares to make any inquiry into the authenticity of the mission\r\nwhich he is performing--he becomes a deserter from God in the very ranks\r\nof battle. He knows that he will be held forever in dishonor among his\r\npeople; that he will be looked upon as one worse than dead; that he will\r\nruin his own life and despoil his parents of all their eternal comfort\r\nand their hope in him.\r\n\r\nWhile I was editing the Salt Lake Tribune, a son of one of the famous\r\napostles came to me with some anxious inquiries, and said: \"Frank, I\r\nhave been working in the Church and teaching this gospel so assiduously\r\nfor nearly forty years that I have never had time to find out whether\r\nit's true or not!\"\r\n\r\nIf the Mormon, in his later years of manhood, dares to doubt, he must\r\neither reveal his disloyalty to the ward teachers or continue to deny\r\nit, from month to month, and remain a supine servant of authority. If\r\nhe reveals it, he knows that the news of his defection will permeate the\r\nentire circle with which he is associated in politics, in business and\r\nin religion. If his superstition does not hold him, his worldly prudence\r\nwill. He knows that all the aid of the community will be withdrawn from\r\nhim; every voice that has expressed affection for him will speak in\r\nhate; every hand that has clasped his in friendship will be turned\r\nagainst him. And into this very prudence there enters something of\r\na moral warning. For he has seen how many a man, deprived of the\r\nassociation and fraternity of the Church, feeling himself shunned in a\r\nlonely ostracism, has not been strong enough to endure in rectitude and\r\nhas fallen into dissipation. Every instance of the sort is rehearsed by\r\nthe faithful, with many exultant expressions of mourning, in the hearing\r\nof the doubter. And finally, it is the prediction of the priests that no\r\napostate can prosper; and though the Mormon people are charitable and\r\ndo not intend to be unjust, they inevitably tend to fulfill the prophecy\r\nand devote the apostate to material destruction.\r\n\r\nThe great doctrine of the Mormon faith is obedience; the one proof of\r\ngrace is conformity. So long as a man pays a full tithe, contributes all\r\nthe required donations, and yields unquestioningly to the orders of\r\nthe priests, he may even depart in a moral sense from any other of\r\nthe Church's laws and find himself excused. But any questioning of the\r\nrulership of the Prophets--the rightfulness of their authority or the\r\njustice of its exercise is apostasy, is a denial of the faith, is a sin\r\nagainst the Holy Ghost. The man who obeys in all things is promised that\r\nhe shall come forth in the morning of the first resurrection; the man\r\nwho disobeys, and by his disobedience apostatizes, is condemned to work\r\nout, through an eternity of suffering, his offense against the Holy\r\nSpirit. At the first sign of defection--almost inevitably discovered in\r\nits incipiency--the rebel is either disciplined into submission or at\r\nonce pushed over \"the battlements of Heaven!\"\r\n\r\nBy such perfect means, the leaders, chosen under a pretense of\r\nrevelation from God, maintain an unassailable sanctity in the eyes of\r\nthe people, who are themselves priests. These people implicitly believe\r\nthat the voice of the leader is the voice of God. They follow with a\r\npassionate devotion that is made up of a fanatical priestly faith and\r\nof a sympathy that sees their Prophets \"persecuted\" by an ungenerous,\r\nimpure and vindictive world. We love that for which we suffer; and it\r\nhas become the inheritance of the Mormons to love the priesthood, for\r\nwhose protection their parents and grandparents suffered, and under\r\nwhose oppressions they now suffer themselves.\r\n\r\nJoseph Smith, the original Prophet, was slain in the Carthage jail; to\r\nthe Mormon mind this is proof that he was the anointed of God and that\r\nhe sealed his testimony with his blood, as did the Savior. John Taylor,\r\nafterwards President of the Church, was not slain at Carthage, but only\r\nwounded; and this to the Mormons is proof that he was of the eternal\r\nkindred of the Prophets, because, under God's direction, he gave his\r\nblood to their defense. But Willard Richards, a companion of Smith and\r\nTaylor, was not even injured at Carthage; and this is accepted as proof\r\nthat God had charge of his holy ones, and would not permit wicked men\r\nto do them harm. When the people left Nauvoo and journeyed through Iowa,\r\nsome of the citizens of that state would not harbor them; and this is\r\nargued as evidence that the Mormon movement was God's work, since the\r\nhand of the wicked was against it; but in some localities of Iowa the\r\nemigrants were aided, and this also is proof that the Mormon movement\r\nwas God's work, since the hearts of the people were melted to assist\r\nit. When Johnston's army was sent to Utah, it was proof that the Mormon\r\nChurch was the true Church, hated and persecuted by a wicked nation;\r\nwhen Johnston's army withdrew without a battle, it was a new guarantee\r\nof the divinity of the work; and it is even believed among the Mormons\r\nthat the Civil War was ordained from the heavens, at the sudden command\r\nof God, to compel Johnston's withdrawal and save God's people.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the persecutions of \"the raid,\" and the cessation\r\nof those persecutions--the early trials of poverty and the present\r\nabundance of prosperity--the threat of the Smoot investigation and the\r\nabortive conclusion of that exposure--are all argued as proofs of the\r\ndivinity of a persecuted Church or given as instances of the miraculous\r\n\"overruling\" of God to prosper his chosen people. No matter what occurs,\r\nthe Prophets, by applying either one of these formulae, can translate\r\nthe incident into a new proof of grace; and their followers submissively\r\naccept the interpretation.\r\n\r\nOn the night of April 18, 1905, Joseph F. Smith and some eight of his\r\nsons sat in his official box at the Salt Lake theatre to watch a\r\nprize fight that lasted for twenty gory rounds. The Salt Lake Tribune\r\npublished the fact that the Prophet of God, and vicegerent of Christ,\r\nhad given the approval of his \"holy presence\" to this clumsy barbarity.\r\nA devout old lady, who had been with the Church since the days of\r\nNauvoo, rebuked us bitterly for publishing such a falsehood about\r\nPresident Smith. \"How dare you tell such wicked lies about God's\r\nservants?\" she scolded. \"President Smith wouldn't do such a wicked thing\r\nas attend a prize fight. And you know that no man with any sense of\r\ndecency would take his young sons to look at such a dreadful thing!\"\r\nSome time later, when the facts in the case had come to her, in her\r\nretirement, from her friends, the editor called upon her to quiz her\r\nabout the incident. She said: \"I'm sure I don't see what business it is\r\nof the outside world anyhow what President Smith does. He has a right\r\nto go to the theatre if he wants to. I don't believe they would have\r\nanything but what's good in the Salt Lake theatre. It was built by our\r\npeople and they own it. And if it wasn't good, President Smith wouldn't\r\nhave taken his boys there.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this was not merely the absurdity of an old woman. It is the logic\r\nof all the faithful. The leaders cannot do wrong--because it is not\r\nwrong, if they do it. No criticism of them can be effective. No act of\r\ntheirs can be proven an error. If they do not do a thing, it was right\r\nnot to do it; and it would have been a sin if it had been done. But if\r\nthey do that thing, then it was right to do it; and it would have been a\r\nsin if it had not been done.\r\n\r\nThis reliance upon the almighty power and prophetic infallibility of the\r\nleaders prevents the Mormon people from truly appreciating the dangers\r\nthat threaten them. It keeps them ignorant of outside sentiment. It\r\nmakes them despise even a national hostility. And it has left them\r\nwithout gratitude, too, for a national grace. Before these people can be\r\nroused to any independence of responsible thought, it will be necessary\r\nto break their trust in the ability of their leaders to make bargains of\r\nprotection with the world; and then it will still be necessary to\r\nforce the eyes of their self-complacency to turn from the satisfied\r\ncontemplation of their own virtues. \"You will never be able to reach the\r\nconscience of the Mormons,\" a man who knows them has declared. \"I\r\nhave had my experiences with both leaders and people. If you tell them\r\n'You're ninety-nine-and-one-half per cent. pure gold,' they will ask,\r\nsurprised and indignant: 'What? Why, what's the matter with the other\r\nhalf per cent?'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOf the men who could have written this narrative, some are dead; some\r\nare prudent; some are superstitious; and some are personally foresworn.\r\nIt appeared to me that the welfare of Utah and the common good of the\r\nwhole United States required the publication of the facts that I have\r\ntried to demonstrate. Since there was apparently no one else who felt\r\nthe duty and also had the information or the wish to write, it seemed\r\nmy place to undertake it. And I have done it gladly. For when I was\r\nsubscribing the word of the Mormon chiefs for the fulfillment of our\r\nstatehood pledges, I engaged my own honor too, and gave bond myself\r\nagainst the very treacheries that I have here recorded.\r\n\r\nWe promised that the Church had forever renounced the doctrine of\r\npolygamy and the practice of plural marriage living, by a \"revelation\r\nfrom God\" promulgated by the supreme Prophet of the Church and accepted\r\nby the vote of the whole congregation assembled in conference. We\r\npromised the retirement of the Mormon Prophets from the political\r\ndirection of their followers--the abrogation of the claim that the\r\nMormon Church was the \"Kingdom of God\" re-established upon earth to\r\nsupersede all civil government--the abandonment by the Church of any\r\nauthority to exercise a temporal power in competition with the civil\r\nlaw. We promised to make the teaching and practice of the Church conform\r\nto the institutions of a Republic in which all citizens are equal in\r\nliberty. We promised that the Church should cease to accumulate property\r\nfor the support of illegal practices and un-American government. And we\r\nmade a record in proof of our promises by the anti-polygamy manifesto\r\nof 1890 and its public ratification; by the petition for amnesty and\r\nthe acceptance of amnesty upon conditions; by the provisions of Utah's\r\nenabling act and of Utah's state constitution; by the acts of Congress\r\nand the judicial decisions restoring escheated Church property; by the\r\nproceedings of the Federal courts of Utah in re-opening citizenship\r\nto the alien members of the Mormon Church; by the acquiescence of the\r\nGentiles of Utah in the proceedings by which statehood was obtained;\r\nand finally, and most indisputably, by the admission of Utah into equal\r\nsovereignty in the Union--since that admission would never have been\r\ngranted, except upon the explicit understanding that the state was to\r\nuphold the laws and institutions of the American republic in accordance\r\nwith our covenants.\r\n\r\nOf all these promises the Church authorities have kept not one. The\r\ndoctrine and practice of polygamy have been restored by the Church, and\r\nplural marriage living is practiced by the ruler of the kingdom and his\r\nfavorites with all the show and circumstance of an oriental court. There\r\nare now being born in his domains thousands of unfortunate children\r\noutside the pale of law and convention, for whom there can be\r\nentertained no hope that any statute will ever give them a place within\r\nthe recognition of civilized society. The Prophet of the Church rules\r\nwith an absolute political power in Utah, with almost as much authority\r\nin Idaho and Wyoming, and with only a little less autocracy in parts\r\nof Colorado, Montana, Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona and New\r\nMexico. He names the Representatives and Senators in Congress from his\r\nown state, and influences decisively the selection of such \"deputies of\r\nthe people\" from many of the surrounding states. Through his ambassadors\r\nto the government of the United States, sitting in House and Senate, he\r\nchooses the Federal officials for Utah and influences the appointment of\r\nthose for the neighboring states and territories. He commands the making\r\nand unmaking of state law. He holds the courts and the prosecuting\r\nofficers to a strict accountability. He levies tribute upon the people\r\nof Utah and helps to loot the citizens of the whole nation by his\r\nalliance with the political and financial Plunderbund at Washington. He\r\nhas enslaved the subjects of his kingdom absolutely, and he looks to it\r\nas the destiny of his Church to destroy all the governments of the world\r\nand to substitute for them the theocracy--the \"government by God\" and\r\nadministration by oracle--of his successors.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even so, I could not have recorded the incidents of this\r\nbetrayal as mere matters of current history--and I would never have\r\nwritten them in vindication of myself--if I had not been certain that\r\nthere is a remedy for the evil conditions in Utah, and that such a\r\nnarrative as this will help to hasten the remedy and right the wrong.\r\nExcept for the aggressive aid given by the national administrations\r\nto the leaders of the Mormon Church, the people of Utah and the\r\nintermountain states would never have permitted the revival of a\r\npriestly tyranny in politics. Except for the protection of courts and\r\nthe enforced silence of politicians and journalists, polygamy could not\r\nhave been restored in the Mormon Church. Except for the interference\r\nof powerful influences at Washington to coerce the Associated Press and\r\naffect the newspapers of the country, the Mormon leaders would never\r\nhave dared to defy the sensibilities of our civilization. Except for\r\nthe greed of the predatory \"Interests\" of the nation, the commercial\r\nabsolutism of the Mormon hierarchy could never have been established.\r\nThe present conditions in the Mormon kingdom are due to national\r\ninfluences. The remedy for those conditions is the withdrawal of\r\nnational sympathy and support.\r\n\r\nBreak the power at Washington of Joseph F. Smith, ruler of the Kingdom\r\nof God, and every seeker after federal patronage in Utah will desert\r\nhim. Break his power as a political partner of the Republican party\r\nnow--and of the Democratic party should it succeed to office--and every\r\nambitious politician in the West will rebel against his throne. Break\r\nhis power to control the channels of public communication through\r\ninterested politicians and commercial agencies, and the sentiment of the\r\ncivilized world will join with the revolt of the \"American movement\" in\r\nUtah to overthrow his tyrannies. Break his connection with the illegal\r\ntrusts and combines of the United States, and his financial power will\r\ncease to be a terror and a menace to the industry and commerce of the\r\nintermountain country.\r\n\r\nThe nation owes Utah such a rectification, for the nation has been, in\r\nthis matter, a chief sinner and a strong encourager of sin. President\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, representing the majesty of the Republic, stayed us\r\nwhen we might have won our own liberties in the revolt that was provoked\r\nby the election of Senator Apostle Reed Smoot. Misled by political\r\nand personal advisers, the President procured delays in the Smoot\r\ninvestigation. He seduced senators from their convictions. He certified\r\nthe ambassador from the Kingdom of God as a qualified senator of the\r\nUnited States. He gave the hand of fellowship to Joseph, the tyrant of\r\nthe Kingdom. He rebuked our friends and his own, in their struggle\r\nfor our freedom, by warning them that they were raising the flag of a\r\nreligious warfare. He filled the Mormon priests with the belief that\r\nthey might proceed unrestrainedly to the sacrifice of women and children\r\nupon the polygamous altar, to the absolute rule of politics in the\r\nintermountain states, and to the commercial exploitation of their\r\ncommunity in partnership with the trusts. The one policy that President\r\nTaft seems to have accepted unimpaired from his predecessor is this\r\nsame respect for the power of the Mormon kingdom. In his placid but\r\nwholehearted way he has encouraged his co-ordinate ruler, the Mormon\r\nProphet, and extended the Executive license to the support and\r\ninevitable increase of these religious tyrannies of the Mormon hierarchs\r\nwhich now the people of Utah, unaided, are wholly unable to combat.\r\n\r\nAnd the nation owes such a rectification not only to Utah, but also to\r\nitself. The commercial and financial Plunderbund that is now preying\r\nupon the whole country is sustained at Washington by the agents of the\r\nMormon Church. The Prophet not only delivers his own subjects up to\r\npillage; he helps to deliver the people of the entire United States.\r\nHis senators are not representatives of a political party; they are the\r\ntools of \"the Interests\" that are his partners. The shameful conditions\r\nin Utah are not isolated and peculiar to that state; they are largely\r\nthe result of national conditions and they have a national effect. The\r\nProphet of Utah is not a local despot only: he is a national enemy; and\r\nthe nation must deal with him.\r\n\r\nI do not ask for a resumption of cruelty, for a return to proscription.\r\nI ask only that the nation shall rouse itself to a sense of its\r\nresponsibility. The Mormon Church has shown its ability to conform to\r\nthe demands of the republic--even by \"revelation from God\" if necessary.\r\nThe leaders of the Church are now defiant in their treasons only because\r\nthe nation has ceased to reprove and the national administrations have\r\npowerfully encouraged. As soon as the Mormon hierarchy discovers that\r\nthe people of this country, wearied of violated treaties and broken\r\ncovenants, are about to exclude the political agents of the Prophet from\r\nany participation in national affairs, the advisers of his inspiration\r\nwill quickly persuade him to make a concession to popular wrath. As soon\r\nas the \"Interests\" realize that the burden of shame in Utah is too large\r\nto be comfortable on their backs, they will throw it off. The President\r\nof the United States will be unable to gain votes by patronizing the\r\ncrucifiers of women and children. The national administrations will\r\nnot dare to stand against the efforts of the Gentiles and independent\r\nMormons of Utah to regain their liberty. And Utah, the Islam of the\r\nWest, will depose its old Sultan and rise free.\r\n\r\nWith this hope--in this conviction--I have written, in all candor,\r\nwhat no reasons of personal advantage or self-justification could\r\nhave induced me to write. I shall be accused of rancor, of religious\r\nantagonism, of political ambition, of egotistical pride. But no man\r\nwho knows the truth will say sincerely that I have lied. Whatever\r\nis attributed as my motive, my veracity in this book will not be\r\nsuccessfully impeached. In that confidence, I leave all the attacks that\r\nguilt and bigotry can make upon me, to the public to whom they will\r\nbe addressed. The truth, in its own time, will prevail, in spite of\r\ncunning. I am willing to await that time--for myself--and for the Mormon\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End",
