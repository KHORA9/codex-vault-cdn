LTD.\r\n\r\n36 ESSEX STREET W.C.\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst published in 1922\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{v}\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThe late convulsions in Greece and Turkey, and the consequent revival\r\nof all the mis-statements which, during the War, flowed from ignorance\r\nor malice, render the publication of this book particularly opportune.\r\n\r\nMr. Abbott deals with his subject in all its aspects, and presents for\r\nthe first time to the British public a complete and coherent view of\r\nthe complicated circumstances that made Greece, during the War, the\r\nbattle-ground of rival interests and intrigues, from which have grown\r\nthe present troubles.\r\n\r\nIn this book we get a clear account of the little-understood relations\r\nbetween the Greek and the Serb; of the attitude of Greece towards the\r\nCentral Powers and the Entente; of the dealings between Greece and the\r\nEntente and the complications that ensued therefrom.  Mr. Abbott traces\r\nthe evil to its source--the hidden pull of British versus French\r\ninterests in the Eastern Mediterranean, and the open antagonism between\r\nM. Venizelos and King Constantine.\r\n\r\nAll these subjects are of acute interest, and not the least interesting\r\nis the last.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of King Constantine by the Press of the Allied\r\ncountries, with some few good exceptions, has been one of the most\r\ntragic affairs since the Dreyfus case.  Its effect on the state of\r\nEurope during and since the War is remarkable.  If King Constantine's\r\nadvice had been followed, and the Greek plan for the taking of the\r\nDardanelles had been carried out, the war would probably have been\r\nshortened by a very considerable period, Bulgaria and Rumania could\r\nhave been kept out of the War, and probably the Russian Revolution and\r\ncollapse would not have taken place; for, instead of having Turkey to\r\nassist Bulgaria, the Allied forces would have been between and\r\nseparating these two countries.  {vi}\r\n\r\nIn this case King Constantine would not have been exiled from his\r\ncountry, and consequently he would not have permitted the Greek Army to\r\nbe sent to Asia Minor, which he always stated would ruin Greece, as the\r\ncountry was not rich enough or strong enough to maintain an overseas\r\ncolony next to an hereditary enemy like the Turk.\r\n\r\nIt is illuminating to remember that the Greek King's policy was fully\r\nendorsed by the only competent authorities who had a full knowledge of\r\nthe subject, which was a purely military one.  These were the late\r\nField-Marshal Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, the British Admiral at the\r\nhead of the Naval Mission in Greece, and Colonel Sir Thomas Cuninghame,\r\nBritish Military Attaché in Athens; but the advice tendered by these\r\nthree officers was disregarded in favour of that given by the\r\ncivilians, M. Venizelos and the Allied Ministers.\r\n\r\nMr. Abbott's book will do much to enlighten a misled public as to the\r\nhistory of Greece during the last nine years, and many documents which\r\nhave not hitherto been before the public are quoted by him from the\r\nofficial originals, to prove the case.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of truth and justice, which used to flourish in Great\r\nBritain, I hope that this book will be read by everyone who has the\r\nwelfare of the British Empire at heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARK KERR\r\n\r\n4 _October_, 1922\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{vii}\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\nAs this work goes to press, the British Empire finds itself forced to\r\nvindicate its position in the East: a position purchased at the cost of\r\nmuch blood and treasure during the war, to be jeopardized after the\r\nconclusion of peace by the defeat of Greece and the defection of France.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages the reader will find the sequence of events\r\nwhich have inevitably led up to this crisis: an account of transactions\r\nhitherto obscured and distorted by every species of misrepresentation\r\nand every known artifice for manipulating public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe volume is not a hasty essay produced to exploit an ephemeral\r\nsituation.  It embodies the fruit of investigations laboriously carried\r\non through six years.  A slight account of the earlier events appeared\r\nas far back as the winter of 1916 in a book entitled, _Turkey, Greece,\r\nand the Great Powers_: that was my first effort to place the subject in\r\nits true perspective.  The results were interesting.  I was honoured by\r\nthe reproaches of several private and by the reprobation of several\r\npublic critics; some correspondents favoured me with their anonymous\r\nscurrility, and some bigots relieved me of their acquaintance.  On the\r\nother hand, there were people who, in the midst of a maelstrom of\r\npassion, retained their respect for facts.\r\n\r\nI pursued the subject further in a weekly journal.  Two of my\r\ncontributions saw the light; the third was suppressed by the\r\nAuthorities.  Its suppression furnished material for a debate in\r\nParliament: \"This is a cleverly written article,\" said Mr. John Dillon,\r\n\"and I cannot find in it a single word which justifies suppression.\r\nAll that one can find in it is that it states certain facts which the\r\nGovernment do not like to be known, not that they injure the military\r\nsituation in the least, but that they show that the Government, in the\r\nopinion of the writer, made certain very bad blunders.\"  The Home\r\nSecretary's answer was {viii} typical of departmental dialectics: \"It\r\nis inconceivable to me,\" he declared, \"that the Government would\r\nventure to say to the Press, or indicate to it in any way, 'This is our\r\nview.  Publish it.  If you do not, you will suffer.'\"  What the\r\nGovernment did, in effect, say to the Editor of the _National Weekly_\r\nwas: \"This is not our view.  Publish it not.  If you do, you will\r\nsuffer.\"\r\n\r\nWith an innocence perhaps pardonable in one who was too intent on the\r\nevolution of the world drama to follow the daily development of\r\nwar-time prohibitions, I next essayed to present to the public through\r\nthe medium of a book the truth which had been banned from the columns\r\nof a magazine.  The manuscript of that work, much fingered by the\r\nprinter, now lies before me, and together with it a letter from the\r\npublisher stating that the Authorities had forbidden its publication on\r\npain of proceedings \"under 27 (b) of the Defence of the Realm\r\nRegulations.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that not until now has it been possible for the\r\nvoice of facts to refute the fables dictated by interest and accepted\r\nby credulity.  The delay had its advantages: it gave the story, through\r\nthe natural progress of events, a completeness which otherwise it would\r\nhave lacked, and enabled me to test its accuracy on every point by a\r\nfresh visit to Greece and by reference to sources previously\r\ninaccessible, such as the Greek State Papers and the self-revealing\r\npublications of persons directly concerned in the transactions here\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\nI venture to hope that so thorough an inquiry will convey some new\r\ninformation respecting these transactions even to those who are best\r\nacquainted with their general course.  If they find nothing attractive\r\nin the style of the book, they may find perhaps something useful,\r\nsomething that will deserve their serious reflection, in the matter of\r\nit.  For let it not be said that a story starting in 1914 is ancient\r\nhistory.  Unless one studies the record of Allied action in Greece from\r\nthe very beginning, he cannot approach with any clear understanding the\r\npresent crisis--a struggle between Greeks and Turks on the surface, but\r\nat bottom a conflict between French and British policies affecting the\r\nvital interests of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nG. F. A.\r\n\r\n5 _October_, 1922\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{ix}\r\n\r\n_Besides information acquired at first hand, my material is mainly\r\ndrawn from the following sources_:\r\n\r\nGreek State Papers now utilized for the first time.\r\n\r\n_White Book_, published by the Government of M. Venizelos under the\r\ntitle, \"_Diplomatika Engrapha_, 1913-1917,\" 2nd edition, Athens, 1920.\r\n\r\n_Orations_, delivered in the Greek Chamber in August, 1917, by M.\r\nVenizelos, his followers, MM. Repoulis, Politis, and Kafandaris, and\r\nhis opponents, MM. Stratos and Rallis.  The Greek text (\"_Agoreuseis,\r\netc._,\" Athens, 1917) and the English translation (\"_A Report of\r\nSpeeches, etc.,_\" London, 1918), give them all, though the speech of M.\r\nStratos only in summary.  The French translation (\"_Discours, etc.,\r\nTraduction de M. Léon Maccas, autorisée par le Gouvernement Grec,_\"\r\nParis, 1917) curiously omits both the Opposition speeches.\r\n\r\nSkouloudis's _Apantesis_, 1917; _Apologia_, 1919; _Semeioseis_, 1921.\r\nThe first of these publications is the ex-Premier's Reply to statements\r\nmade in the Greek Chamber by M. Venizelos and others in August, 1917;\r\nthe second is his Defence; the third is a collection of Notes\r\nconcerning transactions in which he took part.  All three are of the\r\nhighest value for the eventful period of the Skouloudis Administration\r\nfrom November, 1915, to June, 1916.\r\n\r\n_Journal Officiel_, 24-30 October, 1919, containing a full report of\r\nthe Secret Committee of the French Chamber which sat from 16 June to 22\r\nJune, 1916.\r\n\r\nNext in importance, though not inferior in historic interest, come some\r\npersonal narratives, of which I have also availed myself, by leading\r\nFrench actors in the drama:\r\n\r\n_Du Fournet_: \"Souvenirs de Guerre d'un Amiral, 1914-1916.\"  By\r\nVice-Admiral Dartige du Fournet, Paris, 1920.\r\n\r\n_Sarrail_: \"Mon Commandement en Orient, 1916-1918.\"  By General\r\nSarrail, Paris, 1920.\r\n\r\n_Regnault_:  \"La Conquête d'Athènes, Juin-Juillet, 1917.\"  By General\r\nRegnault, Paris, 1920.\r\n\r\n{x}\r\n\r\n_Deville_: \"L'Entente, la Grèce et la Bulgarie.  Notes d'histoire et\r\nsouvenirs.\"  By Gabriel Deville, Paris, 1919.  The author was French\r\nMinister at Athens till August, 1915, and the portions of his work\r\nwhich deal with his own experiences are worth consulting.\r\n\r\n_Jonnart_:  \"M. Jonnart en Grèce et l'abdication de Constantin.\"  By\r\nRaymond Recouly, Paris, 1918.  Though not written by the High\r\nCommissioner himself, this account may be regarded as a semi-official\r\nrecord of his mission.\r\n\r\nThe only English publications of equal value, though of much more\r\nlimited bearing upon the subject of this work, which have appeared so\r\nfar are:\r\n\r\nThe Dardanelles Commission _Reports_ (Cd. 8490; Cd. 8502; Cmd. 371),\r\nand the _Life of Lord Kitchener_, by Sir George Arthur, Vol. III,\r\nLondon, 1920.\r\n\r\nSome trustworthy contributions to the study of these events have also\r\nbeen made by several unofficial narratives, to which the reader is\r\nreferred for details on particular episodes.  The absence of reference\r\nto certain other narratives is deliberate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{xi}\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                             PAGE\r\n  INTRODUCTION      -    -    -    -    -       1\r\n  CHAPTER     I.    -    -    -    -    -       7\r\n  CHAPTER    II.    -    -    -    -    -      17\r\n  CHAPTER   III.    -    -    -    -    -      21\r\n  CHAPTER    IV.    -    -    -    -    -      33\r\n  CHAPTER     V.    -    -    -    -    -      50\r\n  CHAPTER    VI.    -    -    -    -    -      65\r\n  CHAPTER   VII.    -    -    -    -    -      76\r\n  CHAPTER  VIII.    -    -    -    -    -      85\r\n  CHAPTER    IX.    -    -    -    -    -      95\r\n  CHAPTER     X.    -    -    -    -    -     105\r\n  CHAPTER    XI.    -    -    -    -    -     114\r\n  CHAPTER   XII.    -    -    -    -    -     123\r\n  CHAPTER  XIII.    -    -    -    -    -     139\r\n  CHAPTER   XIV.    -    -    -    -    -     152\r\n  CHAPTER    XV.    -    -    -    -    -     162\r\n  CHAPTER   XVI.    -    -    -    -    -     172\r\n  CHAPTER  XVII.    -    -    -    -    -     177\r\n  CHAPTER XVIII.    -    -    -    -    -     186\r\n  CHAPTER   XIX.    -    -    -    -    -     200\r\n  CHAPTER    XX.    -    -    -    -    -     207\r\n  CHAPTER   XXI.    -    -    -    -    -     217\r\n  AFTERWORD    -    -    -    -    -    -     230\r\n  INDEX        -    -    -    -    -    -     239\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}\r\n\r\nGREECE AND THE ALLIES\r\n\r\n1914-1922\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIngenious scholars, surveying life from afar, are apt to interpret\r\nhistorical events as the outcome of impersonal forces which shape the\r\ncourse of nations unknown to themselves.  This is an impressive theory,\r\nbut it will not bear close scrutiny.  Human nature everywhere responds\r\nto the influence of personality.  In Greece this response is more\r\nmarked than anywhere else.  No people in the world has been so\r\ncompletely dominated by personal figures and suffered so grievously\r\nfrom their feuds, ever since the day when strife first parted Atreides,\r\nking of men, and god-like Achilles.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the European War found Greece under the sway of King\r\nConstantine and his Premier Eleutherios Venizelos; and her history\r\nduring that troubled era inevitably centres round these two\r\npersonalities.\r\n\r\nBy the triumphant conduct of the campaigns of 1912 and 1913, King\r\nConstantine had more than effaced the memory of his defeat in 1897.\r\nHis victories ministered to the national lust for power and formed an\r\nearnest of the glory that was yet to come to Greece.  Henceforth a halo\r\nof military romance--a thing especially dear to the hearts of\r\nmen--shone about the head of Constantine; and his grateful country\r\nbestowed upon him the title of {2} _Stratelates_.  In town mansions and\r\nvillage huts men's mouths were filled with his praise: one dwelt on his\r\ndauntless courage, another on his strategic genius, a third on his\r\nsympathetic recognition of the claims of the common soldier, whose\r\nhardships he shared, and for whose life he evinced a far greater\r\nsolicitude than for his own.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only as a leader of armies that King Constantine\r\nappealed to the hearts of his countrymen.  They loved to explain to\r\nstrangers the reason of the name _Koumbaros_ or \"Gossip,\" by which they\r\ncommonly called him.  It was not so much, they would say, that he had\r\nstood godfather to the children born to his soldiers during the\r\ncampaigns, but rather that his relations with the rank and file of the\r\npeople at large were marked by the intimate interest of a personal\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nIn peace, as in war, he seemed a prince born to lead a democratic\r\npeople.  With his tall, virile figure, and a handsome face in which\r\nstrength and dignity were happily blended with simplicity, he had a\r\nmanner of address which was very engaging: his words, few, simple,\r\nsoldier-like, produced a wonderful effect; they were the words of one\r\nwho meant and felt what he said: they went straight to the hearer's\r\nheart because they came straight from the speaker's.\r\n\r\nQualities of a very different sort had enabled M. Venizelos to impose\r\nhimself upon the mind of the Greek nation, and to make his name current\r\nin the Chancelleries of the world.\r\n\r\nHaving begun life as an obscure lawyer in Crete, he had risen through a\r\nseries of political convulsions to high notability in his native\r\nisland; and in 1909 a similar convulsion in Greece--brought about not\r\nwithout his collaboration--opened to him a wider sphere of activity.\r\nThe moment was singularly opportune.\r\n\r\nThe discontent of the Greek people at the chronic mismanagement of\r\ntheir affairs had been quickened by the Turkish Revolution into\r\nsomething like despair.  Bulgaria had exploited that upheaval by\r\nannexing Eastern Rumelia: Greece had failed to annex Crete, and ran the\r\nrisk, if the Young Turks' experiment succeeded, of seeing the {3}\r\nfulfilment of all her national aspirations frustrated for ever.  A\r\ngroup of military malcontents in touch with the Cretan leader\r\ntranslated the popular feeling into action: a revolt against the reign\r\nof venality and futility which had for so many years paralyzed every\r\neffort, which had sometimes sacrificed and always subordinated the\r\ninterests of the nation to the interests of faction, and now left\r\nGreece a prey to Bulgarian and Ottoman ambition.  The old politicians\r\nwho were the cause of the ill obviously could not effect a cure.  A new\r\nman was needed--a man free from the deadening influences of a corrupt\r\npast--a man daring enough to initiate a new course and tenacious enough\r\nto push on with inexorable purpose to the goal.\r\n\r\nDuring the first period of his career, M. Venizelos had been a capable\r\norganizer of administrative departments no less than a clever\r\nmanipulator of seditious movements.  But he had mainly distinguished\r\nhimself as a rebel against authority.  And it was in the temper of a\r\nrebel that he came to Athens.  Obstacles, however, external as well as\r\ninternal, made a subversive enterprise impossible.  With the quick\r\nadaptability of his nature, he turned into a guardian of established\r\ninstitutions: the foe of revolution and friend of reform.  Supported by\r\nthe Crown, he was able to lift his voice for a \"Revisionist\" above the\r\nangry sea of a multitude clamouring for a \"Constituent Assembly.\"\r\n\r\nAll that was healthy in the political world rallied to the new man; and\r\nthe new man did not disappoint the faith placed in him.  Through the\r\nnext two years he stood in every eye as the embodiment of constructive\r\nstatesmanship.  His Government had strength enough in the country to\r\ndispense with \"graft.\"  The result was a thorough overhauling of the\r\nState machinery.  Self-distrust founded on past failures vanished.\r\nGreece seemed like an invalid healed and ready to face the future.  It\r\nwas a miraculous change for a nation whose political life hitherto had\r\nexhibited two traits seldom found combined: the levity of childhood and\r\nthe indolence of age.\r\n\r\nFor this miracle the chief credit undoubtedly belonged {4} to M.\r\nVenizelos.  He had brought to the task a brain better endowed than any\r\nassociated with it.  His initiative was indefatigable; his decision\r\nquick.  Unlike most of his countrymen, he did not content himself with\r\nideas without works.  His subtlety in thinking did not serve him as a\r\nsubstitute for action.  To these talents he added an eloquence of the\r\nkind which, to a Greek multitude, is irresistible, and a certain gift\r\nwhich does not always go with high intelligence, but, when it does, is\r\nworth all the arts of the most profound politician and accomplished\r\norator put together.  He understood, as it were instinctively, the\r\ncharacter of every man he met, and dealt with him accordingly.  This\r\ntact, coupled with a smile full of sweetness and apparent frankness,\r\ngave to his vivid personality a charm which only those could appraise\r\nwho experienced it.\r\n\r\nAbroad the progress of M. Venizelos excited almost as much interest as\r\nit did in Greece.  The Greeks are extraordinarily sensitive to foreign\r\nopinion: a single good word in a Western newspaper raises a politician\r\nin public esteem more than a whole volume of home-made panegyric.  M.\r\nVenizelos had not neglected this branch of his business; and from the\r\noutset every foreign journalist and diplomatist who came his way was\r\nmade to feel his fascination: so that, even before leaving his native\r\nshores, the Cretan had become in the European firmament a star of the\r\nthird or fourth magnitude.  Reasons other than personal contributed to\r\nenlist Western opinion in his favour.  Owing to her geographical\r\nsituation, Greece depends for the fulfilment of her national\r\naspirations and for her very existence on the Powers which command the\r\nMediterranean.  A fact so patent had never escaped the perception of\r\nany Greek politician.  But no Greek politician had ever kept this fact\r\nmore steadily in view, or put this obvious truth into more vehement\r\nlanguage than M. Venizelos: \"To tie Greece to the apron-strings of the\r\nSea Powers,\" was his maxim.  And the times were such that those Powers\r\nneeded a Greek statesman whom they could trust to apply that maxim\r\nunflinchingly.\r\n\r\n{5}\r\n\r\nWith the recovery of Greece synchronized, not by chance, the doom of\r\nTurkey: a sentence in which all the members of the Entente, starting\r\nfrom different points and pursuing different objects, concurred.  The\r\nexecutioners were, naturally, the Balkan States.  Russia began the work\r\nby bringing about an agreement between Bulgaria and Servia; England\r\ncompleted it by bringing Greece into the League.  There ensued a local,\r\nwhich, in accordance with the old diplomatic prophecy, was soon to lead\r\nto the universal conflagration.  Organized as she was, Greece succeeded\r\nbetter than anyone expected; and the national gratitude--the exuberant\r\ngratitude of a Southern people--went out to the two men directly\r\nresponsible for that success: to King Constantine, whose brilliant\r\ngeneralship beat the enemy hosts; and to M. Venizelos, whose able\r\nstatesmanship had prepared the field.  Poets and pamphleteers vied with\r\neach other in expatiating on the wonders they had performed, to the\r\nhonour and advantage of their country.  In this ecstasy of popular\r\nadoration the spirit of the soldier and the spirit of the lawyer seemed\r\nto have met.\r\n\r\nBut the union was illusive and transient.  Between these two men, so\r\nstrangely flung together by destiny, there existed no link of sympathy;\r\nand propinquity only forced the growth of their mutual antagonism.  The\r\nseeds of discord had already borne fruit upon the common ground of\r\ntheir Balkan exploits.  Immediately after the defeat of Turkey a\r\nquarrel over the spoils arose among the victors.  King Constantine,\r\nbearing in mind Bulgaria's long-cherished dream of hegemony, and\r\npersuaded that no sacrifices made by Greece and Servia could do more\r\nthan defer a rupture, urged a Graeco-Servian alliance against their\r\ntruculent partner.  He looked at the matter from a purely Greek\r\nstandpoint and was anxious to secure the maximum of profit for his\r\ncountry.  M. Venizelos, on the other hand, aware that the Western\r\nPowers, and particularly England, wanted a permanent Balkan coalition\r\nas a barrier against Germany in the East, and anxious to retain those\r\nPowers' favour, was prepared to concede {6} much for the sake of\r\naverting a rupture.  Not until the Bulgars betrayed their intentions by\r\nactual aggressions in Macedonia did he withdraw his opposition to the\r\nalliance with Servia, which ushered in the Second Balkan War and led to\r\nthe Peace of Bucharest.  He yielded to the pressure of the\r\ncircumstances brought to bear upon him; but the encounter represented\r\nno more than the preliminary crossing of swords between two strong\r\nantagonists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{7}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when the rupture between Austria and Servia, in July,\r\n1914, came to disturb the peace, Greece deliberately adopted an\r\nattitude of neutrality, with the proviso that she would go to Servia's\r\nassistance in case of a Bulgarian attack upon the latter.  Such an\r\nattitude was considered to be in accordance with the Graeco-Servian\r\nAlliance.  For, although the Military Convention accompanying the\r\nTreaty contained a vague stipulation for mutual support in case of war\r\nbetween one of the allied States and \"a third Power,\" the Treaty itself\r\nhad as its sole object mutual defence against Bulgaria.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of M. Venizelos, her pact did not oblige Greece to go to\r\nServia's assistance against Austria, but at most to mobilize 40,000\r\nmen.[2]  Treaty obligations apart, neutrality was also imposed by\r\npractical considerations.  It was to the interest of Greece--a matter\r\nof self-preservation--not to tolerate a Bulgarian attack on Servia\r\ncalculated to upset the Balkan balance of power established by the\r\nPeace of Bucharest, and she was firmly determined, in concert with\r\nRumania, to oppose such an attack with all her might.  But as to\r\nAustria, M. Venizelos had to consider whether Greece could or could not\r\noffer her ally effective aid, and after consideration he decided that\r\nshe {8} should not proceed even to the mobilization of 40,000 men, for\r\nsuch a measure might provoke a Bulgarian mobilization and precipitate\r\ncomplications.  For the rest, the attitude of Greece in face of\r\nServia's war with Austria, M. Venizelos pointed out, corresponded\r\nabsolutely with the attitude which Servia had taken up in face of\r\nGreece's recent crisis with Turkey.[3]  On that occasion Greece had\r\nobtained from her ally merely moral support, the view taken being that\r\nthe _casus faederis_ would arise only in the event of Bulgarian\r\nintervention.[4]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when the Servian Government asked if it could count on\r\narmed assistance from Greece, M. Streit, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nunder M. Venizelos, answered that the Greek Government was convinced\r\nthat it fully performed its duty as a friend and ally by adopting,\r\nuntil Bulgaria moved, a policy of most benevolent neutrality.  The\r\nco-operation of Greece in the war with Austria, far from helping, would\r\nharm Servia; by becoming a belligerent Greece could only offer her ally\r\nforces negligible compared with the enemy's, while she would inevitably\r\nexpose Salonica, the only port through which Servia could obtain war\r\nmaterial, to an Austrian attack; and, moreover, she would weaken her\r\narmy which, in the common interest, ought to be kept intact as a check\r\non Bulgaria.[5]\r\n\r\nA similar communication, emphasizing the decision to keep out of the\r\nconflict, and to intervene in concert with Rumania only should Bulgaria\r\nby intervening against Servia jeopardize the _status quo_ established\r\nby the Bucharest Treaty--in which case the action of Greece would have\r\na purely Balkan character--was made to the Greek Ministers abroad after\r\na Council held in the Royal Palace under the presidency of the King.[6]\r\n\r\nThis policy brought King Constantine into sharp collision with one of\r\nthe Central Powers, whose conceptions in regard to the Balkans had not\r\nyet been harmonized.  Vienna readily acquiesced in the Greek\r\nGovernment's declaration that it could not permit Bulgaria to\r\ncompromise {9} the Bucharest Treaty, and since by an eventual action\r\nagainst Bulgaria Greece would not quarrel with Austria, the Austrian\r\nGovernment, on its part, promised to abstain from manifesting any\r\nsolidarity with Bulgaria in the event of a Graeco-Bulgarian war.[7]\r\nNot so Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe German Emperor egotistically presumed to dictate the course which\r\nGreece should pursue, and on 31 July he invited King Constantine to\r\njoin Germany, backing the invitation with every appeal to sentiment and\r\ninterest he could think of.  The memory of his father, who had been\r\nassassinated, made it impossible for Constantine to favour the Servian\r\nassassins; never would Greece have a better opportunity of emancipating\r\nherself, under the protection of the Central Powers, from the tutelage\r\nwhich Russia aimed at exercising over the Balkan Peninsula; if,\r\ncontrary to the Kaiser's expectations, Greece took the other side, she\r\nwould be exposed to a simultaneous attack from Italy, Bulgaria and\r\nTurkey, and by the same token all personal relations between him and\r\nConstantine would be broken for ever.  He ended with the words: \"I have\r\nspoken frankly, and I beg you to let me know your decision without\r\ndelay and with the same absolute frankness.\"\r\n\r\nHe had nothing to complain of on that score.  King Constantine on 2\r\nAugust replied that, while it was not the policy of Greece to take an\r\nactive part in the Austro-Servian conflict, it was equally impossible\r\nfor her \"to make common cause with the enemies of the Serbs and to fall\r\nupon them, since they are our allies.  It seems to me that the\r\ninterests of Greece demand an absolute neutrality and the maintenance\r\nof the _status quo_ in the Balkans such as it has been created by the\r\nTreaty of Bucharest.\"  He went on to add that Greece was determined, in\r\nconcert with Rumania, to prevent Bulgaria from aggrandizing herself at\r\nthe expense of Servia; if that happened, the balance in the Balkans\r\nwould be upset and it would bring about the very Russian tutelage which\r\nthe Kaiser feared.  \"This way of thinking,\" he concluded, \"is shared by\r\nthe whole of my people.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the Kaiser thought of these opinions was summed up in one word on\r\nthe margin, \"Rubbish.\"  This, however, was not meant for his\r\nbrother-in-law's ears.  To him he {10} used less terse language.  On 4\r\nAugust he informed King Constantine through the Greek Minister in\r\nBerlin that an alliance had that day been concluded between Germany and\r\nTurkey, that Bulgaria and Rumania were similarly ranging themselves on\r\nGermany's side, and that the German men-of-war in the Mediterranean\r\nwere going to join the Turkish fleet in order to act together.  Thus\r\nall the Balkan States were siding with Germany in the struggle against\r\nSlavism.  Would Greece alone stand out?  His Imperial Majesty appealed\r\nto King Constantine as a comrade, as a German Field Marshal of whom the\r\nGerman Army was proud, as a brother-in-law; he reminded him that it was\r\nthanks to his support that Greece was allowed to retain Cavalla; he\r\nbegged him to mobilize his army, place himself by the Kaiser's side and\r\nmarch hand in hand against the common enemy--Slavism.  He made this\r\nurgent appeal for the last time, convinced that the King of Greece\r\nwould respond to it.  If not, all would be over between the two\r\ncountries--this being a slightly attenuated version of another marginal\r\nnote: \"I will treat Greece as an enemy if she does not adhere at once.\"\r\n\r\nKing Constantine's answer was tactful but final: His personal\r\nsympathies and his political opinions, he said, were on the Kaiser's\r\nside.  But alas! that which the Kaiser asked him to do was completely\r\nout of the question.  Greece could not under any conceivable\r\ncircumstances side against the Entente: the Mediterranean was at the\r\nmercy of the united French and British fleets, which could destroy the\r\nGreek marine, both royal and mercantile, take the Greek islands, and\r\nwipe Greece off the map.  Things being so, neutrality, he declared, was\r\nthe only policy for Greece, and he ended up by meeting the Kaiser's\r\nthreat with a counter-threat, none the less pointed for being veiled\r\nunder the guise of an \"assurance not to touch his friends among my\r\nneighbours (i.e. Bulgaria and Turkey) as long as they do not touch our\r\nlocal Balkan interests.\" [8]\r\n\r\n{11}\r\n\r\nGermany did not immediately resign herself to this rebuff.  The\r\nKaiser's Government thought King Constantine's attachment to neutrality\r\nreasonable--for the present; but at the same time urged Greece to enter\r\nas soon as possible into a secret understanding with Bulgaria and\r\nTurkey for eventual action against Servia, describing the latter\r\ncountry as the bear's skin of which it would be a good stroke of\r\nbusiness for Greece to secure a share.  The German Minister at Athens,\r\nbetter acquainted with Greek views and feelings, took a less naïve\r\nline.  He did not want Greece to attack her ally, but was content to\r\nadvise that she should free herself from the ties that bound her to\r\nServia, and in the event of Bulgarian aggression just leave her ally in\r\nthe lurch.  But, if he went less far than his chief in one direction,\r\nhe went farther in another, threatening, should Greece move on Servia's\r\nbehalf, to ask for his passport.  This threat, like all the others,\r\nfailed to move the Athens Government;[9] and, unable to gain Greece as\r\nan ally, Germany was henceforth glad enough not to have her as an enemy.\r\n\r\nSo far all those responsible for the policy of Greece appeared to be\r\nunanimous in the decision not to be drawn prematurely into the European\r\ncataclysm, but to reserve her forces for the defence of the Balkan\r\nequilibrium.  Under this apparent unanimity, however, lay divergent\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\nKing Constantine, a practical soldier, estimated that the European War\r\nwould be of long duration and doubtful issue: in this battle of giants\r\nhe saw no profit for pygmies, but only perils.  At the same time, he\r\ndid not forget that Greece had in Bulgaria and Turkey two embittered\r\nenemies {12} who would most probably try to fish in the troubled\r\nwaters.  If they did so, he was prepared to fight; but to fight with a\r\ndefinite objective and on a definite military plan which took into\r\naccount the elements of time, place, and resources.\r\n\r\nThe King's standpoint was shared by most Greek statesmen and soldiers\r\nof note: they all, in varying degrees, stood for neutrality, with\r\npossible intervention on the side of the Entente at some favourable\r\nmoment.  But it did not commend itself to his Premier.  Caution was\r\nforeign to M. Venizelos's ambitious and adventurous temperament.\r\nMilitary considerations had little meaning for his civilian mind.\r\nTaking the speedy victory of the Entente as a foregone conclusion, and\r\nimbued with a sort of mystical faith in his own prophetic insight and\r\nstar, he looked upon the European War as an occasion for Imperialist\r\naggrandizement which he felt that Greece ought to grasp without an\r\ninstant's delay.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the underlying divergence came to the surface.\r\n\r\nIn the morning of 18 August, at a full Cabinet Meeting, M. Streit\r\nmentioned that the Russian Minister had privately referred to the\r\npossibility of Greece sending 150,000 men to fight with Servia against\r\nthe Austrians on the Danube--far away from the Greek Army's natural\r\nbase in Macedonia.  On hearing this M. Venizelos impulsively declared\r\nthat he was ready to place all the Greek forces at the disposal of the\r\nEntente Powers in accordance with their invitation.  M. Streit\r\nremonstrated that there had been no \"invitation,\" but at most a\r\nsounding from one of the Entente Ministers, which Greece should meet\r\nwith a counter-sounding, in order to learn to what extent the\r\nsuggestion was serious.  Further, he objected that, before Greece\r\ncommitted herself, it was necessary to find out where she would be\r\nexpected to fight, the conditions under which she would fight, and the\r\ncompensations which she would receive in the event of victory.  As a\r\nlast resort he proposed to adjourn the discussion until the afternoon.\r\nBut M. Venizelos answered that there was no time to lose: the War would\r\nbe over in three weeks.[10]  Whereupon {13} M. Streit resigned, and M.\r\nVenizelos offered to the Entente Ministers the adhesion of Greece\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nThe terms in which this offer was couched have never been divulged; but\r\nfrom the French Minister's descriptions of it as made \"_à titre\r\ngracieux_\" and \"_sans conditions,_\" [11] it seems to have been\r\nunconditional and unqualified.  On the other hand, M. Venizelos at a\r\nlater period explained that he had offered to place Greece at the\r\ndisposal of the Entente Powers, if Turkey went to war with them.[12]\r\nAnd it is not improbable that the primary objective in his mind was\r\nTurkey, who still refused to relinquish her claims to the islands\r\nconquered by the Greeks in 1912, and had just strengthened her navy\r\nwith two German units, the _Goeben_ and the _Breslau_.  However that\r\nmay be, King Constantine seconded the offer, expressing himself quite\r\nwilling to join the Entente there and then with the whole of his army,\r\nbut stipulating, on the advice of the General Staff, that the Greek\r\nforces should not be moved to any place where they could not, if need\r\narose, operate against Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe King of England telegraphed to the King of Greece, thanking him for\r\nthe proposal, which, he said, his Government would consider.  The\r\nFrench and Russian Governments expressed lively satisfaction, France,\r\nhowever, adding: \"For the moment we judge that Greece must use all her\r\nefforts to make Turkey observe her promised neutrality, and to avoid\r\nanything that might lead the Turkish Government to abandon its\r\nneutrality.\"  The British answer, when it came at last, was to the same\r\neffect: England wished by all means to avoid a collision with Turkey\r\nand advised that Greece also should avoid a collision.  She only\r\nsuggested for the present an understanding between the Staffs with a\r\nview to eventual action.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was apparently a concession to Mr. Winston Churchill,\r\nwho just then had formed the opinion that Turkey would join the Central\r\nPowers, and had arranged with Lord Kitchener that two officers of the\r\nAdmiralty should meet two officers of the War Office to work out a plan\r\nfor the seizure, by means of a Greek army, of the {14} Gallipoli\r\nPeninsula, with a view to admitting a British fleet to the Sea of\r\nMarmara.[13] But it no way affected the British Government's policy.\r\nThe utmost that England and France were prepared to do in order to meet\r\nthe offer of Greece, and that only if she were attacked, was to prevent\r\nthe Turkish fleet from coming out of the Dardanelles; France also\r\nholding out some hope of financial assistance, but none of war material\r\non an adequate scale.[14]\r\n\r\nSuch a reception of his advances was not very flattering to M.\r\nVenizelos--it made him look foolish in the eyes of those who had\r\npleaded against precipitancy; and he took the earliest opportunity to\r\nvent his ill-humour.  King Constantine, in a reply to the British\r\nAdmiralty drafted with Vice-Admiral Mark Kerr, stated that he would not\r\nfight Turkey unless attacked by her--a statement in strict consonance\r\nwith the wishes of the Entente Powers at the time.  But M. Venizelos\r\nobjected.  After his own declarations to the Entente Ministers, and\r\nafter the exchange of telegrams with the King of England, he told his\r\nsovereign he did not consider this reply possible.  Turkey was their\r\nenemy, and was it wise for them to reject a chance of fighting her with\r\nmany and powerful allies, so that they might eventually have to fight\r\nher single-handed?[15]\r\n\r\nThus M. Venizelos argued, in the face of express evidence that those\r\nallies did not desire the immediate participation of Greece in a war\r\nagainst Turkey--because, anxious above all things to establish close\r\ncontact with them, he wanted the offer to remain open: \"a promise that,\r\nshould at any time the Powers consider us useful in a war against\r\nTurkey . . . we would be at their disposal.\" [16]  And he professed\r\nhimself unable to understand how a course which appeared so clear to\r\nhim could possibly be obscure to others.  But he had a theory--a theory\r\nwhich served him henceforward as a stock explanation of every\r\ndifference of opinion, and in which the political was skilfully mixed\r\n{15} with the personal factor.  According to this theory, when face to\r\nface with M. Venizelos, the King seldom failed to be convinced; but as\r\nsoon as M. Venizelos withdrew, he changed his mind.  This happened not\r\nonce, but many times.[17]  We have here a question of psychology which\r\ncannot be casually dismissed.  M. Venizelos's persuasive powers are\r\nnotorious, and it is highly probable that King Constantine underwent\r\nthe fascination which this man had for others.  But behind it all,\r\naccording to the Venizelist theory, lurked another element:\r\n\r\n\"What, I think, confuses things and begets in the mind of your Majesty\r\nand of M. Streit tendencies opposed to those supported by me, is the\r\nwish not to displease Germany by undertaking a war against Turkey in\r\nco-operation with Powers hostile to her.\"  Although M. Streit had laid\r\ndown his portfolio, he continued to be consulted by the King, with the\r\nresult, M. Venizelos complained, that the difference of opinions\r\nbetween the ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs and himself was fast\r\ndeveloping into a divergence of courses between the Crown and the\r\nCabinet: such a state of things was obviously undesirable, and M.\r\nVenizelos, \"in order to facilitate the restoration of full harmony\r\nbetween the Crown and its responsible advisers,\" offered his\r\nresignation.[18]\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos did not resign after all.  But his letter marks an epoch\r\nnone the less.  At first, as we have seen, the avowed policy of the\r\nPremier, of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of the King was the\r\nsame.  The difference which now emerges is that M. Venizelos desired to\r\nthrow Greece into the War immediately, without conditions and without\r\nany invitation from the Entente, while the King and M. Streit were more\r\ncircumspect.  M. Venizelos chose to interpret their circumspection as\r\nprompted by regard for Germany, and did not hesitate to convey this\r\nview to Entente quarters.  It was, perhaps, a plausible insinuation,\r\nsince the King had a German wife and M. Streit was of German descent.\r\nBut, as a matter of fact, at the moment when it was made, King\r\nConstantine voluntarily presented to the British Admiralty through\r\nAdmiral Kerr the plans for the taking of the Dardanelles which his\r\nStaff had {16} elaborated, and for a long time afterwards continued to\r\nsupply the British Government, through the same channel, with\r\ninformation from his secret service.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Art. 1 of the Military Convention.  As this article originally\r\nstood, the promise of mutual support was expressly limited to the \"case\r\nof war between Greece and Bulgaria or between Servia and Bulgaria.\"  It\r\nwas altered at the eleventh hour at Servia's request, and not without\r\nobjections on the part of Greek military men, into a \"case of war\r\nbetween one of the allied States and a third Power breaking out under\r\nthe circumstances foreseen by the Graeco-Servian Treaty of Alliance.\"\r\nBut the only circumstances foreseen and provided for by that Treaty\r\nrelate to war with Bulgaria, and it is a question whether any other\r\ninterpretation would stand before a court of International Law, despite\r\nthe \"third Power\" phrase in the Military Convention.

As much\r\nacrimonious discussion has arisen over King Constantine's last\r\ndispatch, it is worth while noting the circumstances under which it was\r\nsent.  Vice-Admiral Mark Kerr, Chief of the British Naval Mission in\r\nGreece, relates how the King brought the Kaiser's telegram and read it\r\nto him: \"He was indignant at the interference in his country's affairs.\r\nHowever, to stop such telegrams coming in daily, he determined to send\r\non this occasion a sympathetic answer.\"  (See _The Times_, 9 Dec.,\r\n1920.)  The communication, therefore, was no secret from the British\r\nGovernment.  Nor was it from M. Venizelos; for the King's dispatch is\r\nbut a summary of an identical declaration made by M. Venizelos's\r\nGovernment itself to the German Government: Streit to Greek Legation,\r\nBerlin, 26 July/8 Aug., 1914.

One must know all the possible combinations on the\r\nBalkan chess-board before one can profitably study or estimate the real\r\nplace of the Greek pawn.\r\n\r\nBulgaria proclaimed her firm intention to remain neutral; but, to judge\r\nfrom the Greek diplomatic representatives' reports, there was every\r\nindication that she only awaited a favourable opportunity, such as some\r\nbrilliant military success of the Central Powers, in order to invade\r\nServia without risk.  Meanwhile, well-armed irregular bands, equipped by\r\nthe Bulgarian Government and commanded by Bulgarian officers \"on\r\nfurlough,\" made their appearance on the Servian frontier, and the\r\nBulgarian Press daily grew more hostile in its tone.[1]\r\n\r\nAlarmed by these symptoms, the Greek General Staff renewed the efforts\r\nwhich it had been making since the beginning of 1914, to concert plans\r\nwith the Servian military authorities for common action in accordance\r\nwith their alliance, and asked the Servian Minister of War if, in case\r\nBulgaria ordered a general mobilization, Servia would be disposed to\r\nbring part of her forces against her, so as to prevent the concentration\r\nof the Bulgarian army and give the Greek army time to mobilize.  The\r\nreply was that, if Bulgaria did order mobilization, the Serbs were\r\nobliged to turn against her with all their available forces.  Only, as\r\nAustria had just started an offensive, nobody could know how many forces\r\nthey would have available--perhaps they could face the situation with the\r\n25,000 or 30,000 men in the new provinces; but, in {18} any case, it did\r\nnot seem that Bulgaria meant to mobilize, or, if she did, it would be\r\nagainst Turkey.  A little later, in answer to another Greek step, M.\r\nPassitch, the Servian Premier, after a conference with the military\r\nchiefs, stated that, as long as there was no imminent danger from\r\nBulgaria, Servia could not draw troops from the Austrian frontier,\r\nbecause of her engagements towards the Entente, and that, should the\r\ndanger become imminent, Servia would have to consult first the\r\nEntente.[2]  By Entente, he meant especially Russia, for M.  Sazonow had\r\nalready told the Greek Minister at Petrograd that it was all-important\r\nthat the Servian army should be left free to devote its whole strength\r\nagainst the Austrians.[3]\r\n\r\nRumania, on whose co-operation Greece counted for restraining Bulgaria\r\nand preserving the balance established by the Treaty of Bucharest,\r\nmaintained an equivocal attitude: both belligerent groups courted her,\r\nand it was as yet uncertain which would prevail.[4]  For the present\r\nRumanian diplomacy was directed to the formation of a Balkan _bloc_ of\r\nneutrality--between Rumania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece--which might\r\nenable those four States to remain at peace with each other and the whole\r\nworld, exempt from outside interference.  The first step to the\r\nrealization of this idea, the Rumanian Government considered, was a\r\nsettlement of the differences between Greece and Turkey; and, in\r\ncompliance with its invitation, both States sent their plenipotentiaries\r\nto Bucharest.\r\n\r\nThe only result of this mission was to enlighten the Hellenic Government\r\non Turkey's real attitude.  At the very first sitting, the Turkish\r\ndelegate, Talaat Bey, in answer to a remark that the best thing for the\r\nBalkan States would be to keep out of the general conflagration, blurted\r\nout: \"But Turkey is no longer free as to her movements\"--an avowal of the\r\nGermano-Turkish alliance which the Greeks already knew from the Kaiser's\r\nown indiscretions.  After that meeting, in a conversation with the\r\nRumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, which that gentleman reported to\r\nthe Greeks, Talaat said that, in his opinion, Greece could ignore her\r\nServian alliance, for, {19} as things stood, she might find herself at\r\nwar, not only with Bulgaria, but also with Turkey--a contingency not\r\nforeseen when that alliance was made.  From these utterances the Greeks\r\nderived a clear impression that Talaat acted on a plan drawn up in\r\nBerlin.[5]  For the rest, the despatch of the _Goeben_ and the _Breslau_\r\nto Constantinople, followed by the continued arrival of German officers\r\nand sailors for the Ottoman Navy, spoke for themselves.  M. Sazonow\r\nshared the Greek conviction that Turkey had made up her mind, and that no\r\namount of concessions would avail: \"It is,\" he said to the Greek Minister\r\nat Petrograd, \"an abscess which must burst.\" [6]  The Greeks had even\r\nreason to suspect that Turkey was secretly negotiating an agreement with\r\nBulgaria, and on this point also the information of the Russian\r\nGovernment confirmed theirs.[7]\r\n\r\nIt was his intimate knowledge of the Balkan situation that had inspired\r\nKing Constantine's proposal to the Entente Powers in August for common\r\naction against Turkey, qualified with the stipulation of holding Bulgaria\r\nin check.  The proposal took cognizance of Balkan difficulties and might\r\nperhaps have solved them, had it been accepted: an advance of the Greek\r\narmy on Thrace, combined with a naval attack by the British Fleet, early\r\nin September, might have settled Turkey, secured Bulgaria's neutrality,\r\nif not indeed her co-operation, or forced her into a premature\r\ndeclaration of hostility, and decided Rumania to throw in her lot with us.\r\n\r\nBut the Entente Powers were not yet ripe for action against Turkey: they\r\nwere still playing--with what degree of seriousness is a delicate\r\nquestion--for the neutrality of Turkey, and for that Greek neutrality was\r\nnecessary.  As to Bulgaria, our diplomacy harboured a different project:\r\nthe reconstruction of the Balkan League of 1912 in our favour, on the\r\nbasis of territorial concessions to be made to Bulgaria by Servia and\r\nGreece, who were to be compensated by dividing Albania between them.\r\nGreece also had from England an alternative suggestion--expansion in Asia\r\nMinor: a vague and {20} unofficial hint, destined to assume imposing\r\ndimensions later on.  At this stage, however, the whole project lacked\r\nprecise outline.  One plan of the reconstructed League included\r\nRumania--who also was to make concessions to Bulgaria and to receive\r\ncompensations at the expense of Austria; and the League was to be brought\r\ninto the field on the side of the Entente.  Another plan had less\r\nambitious aims: Servia and Greece by conciliating Bulgaria were to\r\nprevent a combination of Rumania, Bulgaria, and Turkey, or of Bulgaria\r\nand Turkey, on the side of the Central Powers.  The more sanguine plan\r\nwas especially cherished by Great Britain; the other by Russia, who\r\nfeared a Rumano-Bulgaro-Turkish combination against her.  But the\r\nkey-stone in both was Bulgaria, whose co-operation, or at least\r\nneutrality, was to be purchased at the cost of Servia and Greece.[8]\r\nMeanwhile, the less serious the Entente Powers' hopes for Turkey's\r\nneutrality, the more lively their anxiety must have been about Bulgaria's\r\nattitude; and it is not improbable that in repelling King Constantine's\r\noffer, they were actuated not so much by the wish to avoid Turkish\r\nhostility--the reason given--as by the fear lest the stipulation which\r\naccompanied his offer, if accepted, should provoke Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nHighly speculative as this project was, it might have materialized if\r\nSerbs and Greeks were willing to pay the price.  But neither Serbs nor\r\nGreeks would think of such a thing.  At the mere report that they were\r\nabout to be asked to cede Cavalla, the Greeks went mad, and M.  Venizelos\r\nhimself, though he favoured the reconstruction of the Balkan League,\r\nloudly threatened, if the demand was formulated, to resign.  Whereupon,\r\nhis consternation having been transmitted to the Entente capitals, he\r\nreceived an assurance that no demand of the sort would be made[9]--for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Naoum, Sofia, 11, 20 Aug.

Both enterprises\r\nwere \"under consideration\"--which means that the Entente Cabinets were\r\nbusy discussing both and unable to decide on either.  Distracted by\r\nconflicting aims and hampered by inadequate resources, they could not act\r\nexcept tentatively and in an experimental fashion.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of November the representatives of France, England, and\r\nRussia at Athens collectively seconded a Servian appeal for assistance to\r\nM. Venizelos, which the Greek Premier met with a flat refusal.  He gave\r\nhis reasons: such action, he said, would infallibly expose Greece to\r\naggression from Bulgaria, and it was more than probable that an automatic\r\nagreement between Bulgaria and Turkey might engage the Greek army in a\r\nstruggle with the forces of three Powers at once.  Even if the attack\r\ncame from Bulgaria alone, he added, the Greek army needed three weeks to\r\nconcentrate at Salonica and another month to reach the theatre of the\r\nAustro-Servian conflict, and in that interval the Bulgarian army,\r\ninvading Servia, would render impossible all contact between the Greek\r\nand Servian armies.  The Entente Ministers endeavoured to overcome these\r\nobjections by assuring M. Venizelos that Bulgaria could not possibly\r\nrange herself against Russia, France, and England; and besides, they\r\nsaid, their Governments could ask Rumania to guarantee Bulgarian\r\nneutrality.  M. Venizelos replied that, if the co-operation of Bulgaria\r\nwith Rumania and Greece were secured, then the Greeks could safely assist\r\nServia in an effective manner; or the next best thing might be an\r\nundertaking by Rumania to guarantee the neutrality of Bulgaria; and he\r\nproceeded to ascertain the Rumanian Government's views on the subject.\r\nHe learnt that, in {22} answer to a question put to the Rumanian Premier\r\nby the Entente Ministers at Bucharest, \"whether he would undertake to\r\nguarantee the neutrality of Bulgaria towards Greece if the latter Power\r\nsent succour to the Serbs,\" M. Bratiano, while professing the greatest\r\ngoodwill towards Greece and the Entente, declined to give any such\r\nundertaking.[1]  Add another important fact to which the Greek Government\r\nhad its attention very earnestly drawn about this time--that not only\r\nServia, but even Belgium, experienced the greatest difficulty in\r\nprocuring from France the munitions and money necessary for continuing\r\nthe struggle.[2]\r\n\r\nIn the circumstances, there was no alternative for M. Venizelos but to\r\nadopt the prudent attitude which on other occasions he was pleased to\r\nstigmatize as \"pro-German.\"  True, his refusal to move in November was\r\nhardly consistent with his eagerness to do so in August; but, taking into\r\naccount his temperament, we must assume that he had made that rash _à\r\ntitre gracieux_ offer blindfold.  Events had not borne out his\r\npredictions of a speedy victory, and, though his faith in the ultimate\r\ntriumph of the Entente remained unshaken, he had come to realize that,\r\nfor the present at any rate, it behoved Hellas to walk warily.[3]\r\n\r\nSome ten weeks passed, and then (23 January, 1915) Sir Edward Grey again\r\nasked M. Venizelos for assistance to Servia in the common interest; as\r\nAustria and Germany seemed bent on crushing her, it was essential that\r\nall who could should lend her their support.  If Greece ranged herself by\r\nServia's side as her ally, the Entente Powers would willingly accord her\r\nvery important territorial concessions on the Asia Minor Coast.  The\r\nmatter was {23} urgent, for, were Servia crushed, though the ultimate\r\ndefeat of Austria and Germany would not be thereby affected, there would\r\nduring the War come about in the Balkans accomplished facts which would\r\nmake it difficult or even impossible for either Servia or Greece to\r\nobtain afterwards arrangements as favourable as those actually in view.\r\nConversely, the immediate participation of Greece and Rumania in the War\r\nwould, by bringing about the defeat of Austria, secure the realization of\r\nGreek, Rumanian and Servian aspirations.  To render such participation\r\neffective, it was desirable that Bulgaria should be assured that, if\r\nServian and Greek aspirations elsewhere were realized, she would obtain\r\nsatisfactory compensations in Macedonia, on condition that she came in or\r\nat least maintained a not malevolent neutrality.  But the question of\r\ncompensations affected chiefly Servia: all he asked of M. Venizelos on\r\nthat point was not to oppose any concessions that Servia might be\r\ninclined to make to Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nWhether this semi-official request amounted to a proposal or was merely\r\nin the nature of a suggestion is hard to determine.  But M. Venizelos\r\nseems to have understood it in the latter sense, for in speaking of it he\r\nmade use of the very informal adjective \"absurd.\"  No one, indeed, could\r\nseriously believe that Bulgaria would be induced to co-operate, or even\r\nto remain neutral, by the hypothetical and partial promises which Sir\r\nEdward Grey indicated; and with a potentially hostile Bulgaria in her\r\nflank Greece could not march to Servia's aid.  So M. Venizelos, under the\r\nimpulse of ambition, set his energetic brain to work, and within a few\r\nhours produced a scheme calculated to correct the \"absurdity\" of the\r\nBritish notion, to earn the gratitude of the Entente to himself, and an\r\nAsiatic Empire for his country.  It was nothing less than a complete\r\nreversal of his former attitude: that Greece should not only withdraw her\r\nopposition to concessions on the part of Servia, but should voluntarily\r\nsacrifice Cavalla to the Bulgars, provided they joined the Allies\r\nforthwith.  This scheme he embodied in a lengthy memorandum which he\r\nsubmitted to the King.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos recognized how painful a sacrifice the cession of Cavalla\r\nwould be, and therefore he had to use very strong arguments to commend it\r\nto his Majesty.  In the {24} first place, he emphasized the imperative\r\nneed of helping Servia, since, should Servia be crushed, the\r\nAustro-German armies might be tempted to advance on Salonica, or Bulgaria\r\nmight be invited to take possession of Servian Macedonia, in which case\r\nGreece would have either to let the Balkan balance of power go by the\r\nboard, or, in accordance with her Treaty, go to Servia's assistance under\r\nmuch more disadvantageous conditions.  In the second place, he argued\r\nthat the sacrifice of Cavalla was well worth making, since Greece would\r\neventually receive in Asia Minor compensations which would render her\r\ngreater and more powerful than the most sanguine Greek could even have\r\ndreamt a few years before; and in Macedonia itself the loss of Cavalla\r\ncould be partially compensated for by a rectification of frontiers\r\ninvolving the acquisition from Servia of the Doiran-Ghevgheli district.\r\n\r\nIn the event of Bulgaria accepting Cavalla and the Servian concessions as\r\nthe price of her alliance, M. Venizelos argued that the outcome would be\r\na reconstructed League of the Balkan States which would not only ensure\r\nthem against defeat, but would materially contribute to the victory of\r\nthe Entente Powers: even the ideal of a lasting Balkan Federation might\r\nbe realized by a racial readjustment through an interchange of\r\npopulations.  Should Bulgarian greed prove impervious, Greece must secure\r\nthe co-operation of Rumania, without which it would be too risky for her\r\nto move.[4]\r\n\r\nSacrifices of territory, in King Constantine's opinion, were out of the\r\nquestion; but he thought that, if Rumania agreed to co-operate, it might\r\nbe possible for Greece to go to Servia's assistance, as in that case\r\nBulgaria could perhaps be held in check by Rumanian and Greek forces left\r\nalong her northern and southern frontiers.  The Bucharest Government was\r\naccordingly sounded, and returned an answer too evasive to justify\r\nreliance on its co-operation.  So M. Venizelos fell back on the scheme of\r\nbuying Bulgarian co-operation by the cession of Cavalla, and submitted a\r\nsecond memorandum to the King.\r\n\r\nIf the first of these documents was remarkable for its optimism, the\r\nsecond might justly be described as a {25} masterpiece of faith pure and\r\nundefiled by any contact with sordid facts.  Its theme is the magnitude\r\nof the compensations which Greece might expect in return for her entry\r\ninto the War: \"I have a feeling,\" says the author, \"that the concessions\r\nin Asia Minor suggested by Sir Edward Grey can, especially if we submit\r\nto sacrifices to the Bulgars, assume such dimensions as to double the\r\nsize of Greece.  I believe that if we demanded\"--he specifies in detail a\r\nvast portion of Western Asia Minor--\"our demand would probably be\r\ngranted.\"  He calculated that the surface of this territory exceeds\r\n125,000 (the figure was soon raised to 140,000) square kilometres, while\r\nthe area to be ceded in Macedonia did not exceed 2,000 square kilometres,\r\nand that loss would be further halved by the acquisition from Servia of\r\nthe Doiran-Ghevgheli district, which covered some 1,000 square\r\nkilometres.  Thus, in point of territory, Greece would be giving up a\r\nhundred and fortieth part of what she would be getting.  In point of\r\npopulation also Greece would be receiving twenty-five times as much as\r\nshe would be sacrificing--an accretion of 800,000 as against a loss of\r\n30,000 souls; and that loss could be obviated by obliging Bulgaria to buy\r\nup the property of the Cavalla Greeks, who, he had no doubt, would gladly\r\nemigrate _en masse_ to Asia Minor, to reinforce the Greek element there.\r\nHow was it possible to hesitate about seizing such an opportunity--an\r\nopportunity for the creation of a Greece powerful on land and supreme in\r\nthe Aegean Sea--\"an opportunity verily presented to us by Divine\r\nProvidence for the realization of our most audacious national\r\nideals\"--presented to-day and never likely to occur again?\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos did not doubt but that a transaction which appeared so\r\ndesirable and feasible to him must appear equally desirable and feasible\r\nto others: and great was his surprise to find that such was by no means\r\nthe case.  The General Staff, he complained, \"seem, strangely, not\r\nattracted strongly by these views.\"  And the same might be said of\r\neveryone who judged, not by the glow of prophetic insight, but by a cold\r\nexamination of facts.  When Asia Minor was first mentioned to the Greek\r\nMinister in London, that shrewd diplomat answered:  \"Greece would not\r\ncommit such a folly, for the day she set foot in {26} Asia Minor she\r\nwould find herself up against Great Powers as well as against Turkey.\"\r\n[5]  At Athens to this objection were added others not less weighty.  The\r\nGeneral Staff pointed out that Greece had neither the men nor the money\r\nrequired for the permanent occupation and efficient administration of\r\nthat distant region.  They feared both the difficulties of defending\r\nthose Turkish territories in Asia and the danger of future attack from\r\nBulgaria in Europe.  In short, they held that Greece by embarking on what\r\nthey aptly termed a Colonial policy would be undertaking responsibilities\r\nwholly incommensurate with her resources.[6]\r\n\r\nDangers and difficulties! cried M. Venizelos: can you allow such things\r\nto stand in the way of national ideals?  And he proceeded to demolish the\r\nobstructions: the administrative success achieved in Macedonia proved\r\nthat the resources of Greece were equal to fresh responsibilities; the\r\nTurks of Asia Minor--after the total disappearance of the Ottoman Empire,\r\nwhich he deemed inevitable--would become contented and law-abiding Greek\r\nsubjects, and at all events the local Greek population would in a very\r\nshort space of time supply all the forces needed to maintain order in\r\nAsia, leaving the main Greek army free for the defence of the European\r\nfrontiers.  During that brief period of transition, he thought it easy to\r\nform an agreement with the Entente Powers for military assistance against\r\na Bulgarian attack, or, even without the Entente, \"should the Bulgars be\r\nso demented by the Lord as to attempt aggression, I have not the\r\nslightest doubt that Servia, moved by her treaty obligations, her\r\ninterests, and her gratitude for our present aid, would again co-operate\r\nwith us to humble Bulgarian insolence.\" [7]\r\n\r\nThus at a moment's notice M. Venizelos became an impassioned advocate of\r\nthe policy of which he had hitherto been an impassioned opponent, and he\r\nwould have us believe that the King, persuaded by his eloquence,\r\nauthorised him to carry out his new plan.  Be that as it may, M.\r\nVenizelos did not avail himself of this permission.  {27} For almost\r\nsimultaneously came the news of a Bulgarian loan contracted in the\r\nAustro-German market--an event which made him abandon all hopes of\r\nconciliating Bulgaria and profiting by the British overture.  During the\r\nmonths when the revival of the Balkan League was perhaps still\r\npracticable, he had combated the only expedient which might have given it\r\na chance of realization: by the time he became a convert, it was too late.\r\n\r\nThe Balkan situation remained as it was before Sir Edward Grey's\r\nsuggestion: so much so that, when a few days later the Entente Powers\r\nagain asked Greece to go to Servia's relief, offering her as security\r\nagainst the Bulgarian danger to transport to Macedonia a French and a\r\nBritish division, M. Venizelos, considering such security insufficient,\r\nagain refused;[8] a refusal which, justified though it was, gave great\r\numbrage.[9]\r\n\r\nWhile the Greek Premier was going through these mental evolutions, the\r\nscene of Entente activity shifted: and his flexible mind perforce veered\r\nin a new direction.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 3 November, the outer forts of the Dardanelles had been\r\nsubjected to a brief bombardment with the object of testing the range of\r\ntheir guns; and by 25 November the idea of a serious attack on the\r\nStraits had engaged the attention of the British War Council.  But no\r\ndecision was arrived at until January, when Russia, hard pressed by the\r\nTurks on the Caucasus, begged for a demonstration against them in some\r\nother quarter.  In compliance with this appeal, the British War Council\r\nthen decided to attempt to force the Dardanelles by means of the Navy\r\nalone.  After the failure of the naval attack of 19 February, however, it\r\nwas realized that the operations would have to be supplemented by\r\nmilitary action;[10] and as the magnitude of the enterprise became\r\nclearer and the troops at the disposal of England and France were very\r\nlimited, the need of securing Balkan allies became more obvious.\r\n\r\nFrom the first greater importance was attached to Bulgarian co-operation\r\nthan to Greek.  Even the grant of {28} a loan to Sofia by the Central\r\nPowers appears to have produced little or no impression upon those\r\nconcerned.  Long afterwards it was admitted as a self-evident proposition\r\nthat belligerents do not lend to neutrals without being satisfied that\r\ntheir money will not be used against themselves.  But at the time, after\r\na momentary shock, the Entente Governments were deluded, either by\r\nBulgarian diplomacy or by their own wishes, into the belief that\r\n\"Bulgaria would not commit the stupidity to refuse the advantages\r\noffered.\" [11]  Nor, in thus reckoning on enlightened bad faith, were\r\nthey alone.  M. Venizelos, who a moment before had declared that the loan\r\nhad opened his eyes to the fact \"that Bulgaria was definitely committed\r\nto the Central Powers,\" now felt quite sure that, \"notwithstanding the\r\nloan, Bulgaria was capable of betraying her then friends and turning\r\ntowards those who promised her greater profits.\" [12]  Anxious,\r\ntherefore, to forestall the Bulgars, and concerned by the thought that he\r\nhad been obliged on three occasions to decline requests from the Entente,\r\nhe spontaneously proposed, on 1 March, to offer three Greek divisions for\r\nthe Dardanelles expedition, stating that this proposal was made with King\r\nConstantine's assent.[13]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, neither the King nor his General Staff approved of\r\nM. Venizelos's strategy.  Having made a systematic study of the\r\nDardanelles problem, they judged that the Allies' enterprise, even under\r\nthe most skilful handling, presented but few chances, and those chances\r\nhad been discounted in advance by utter want of skilful handling: the\r\nbombardment of the Straits in the previous November had given the Turks\r\nwarning of the blow and ample time to prepare against it--and the Turks\r\nwere no longer the happy-go-lucky fellows upon whose inefficiency one\r\nmight formerly have counted; they now mounted guard over the gates of\r\ntheir capital equipped with German guns and commanded by German officers.\r\nThe enterprise was likely to become more hazardous still by arousing the\r\njealousy of the Bulgars.  If, therefore, Greece did join in, besides all\r\nthe other risks, she would expose herself to a {29} Bulgarian assault;\r\nand with a considerable portion of her forces engaged in Gallipoli, and\r\nno prospect either of Servian or of Rumanian assistance, how was she to\r\nface that assault?\r\n\r\nThe King's disapproval was known to no one better than to M. Venizelos\r\nhimself.  But, for all that, he felt entitled to tell the British\r\nMinister at Athens that he had the King's assent.  Here is his own\r\nexplanation: \"The King was opposed to the enterprise.  I sought another\r\ninterview in order to speak to him again on the subject, and took with me\r\na third memorandum\"--which has never been published, and cannot yet be\r\npublished.  \"I asked him to let me read it to him, for in it were set\r\nforth fully all the arguments which, in my opinion, imposed co-operation.\r\nI read it.  I saw that the King became agitated.  For--I must do him that\r\njustice--he rarely remained unconvinced when face to face with me.  So\r\nprofound was the emotion with which I spoke, so powerful were the\r\narguments which I used that the King, greatly moved, said to me: 'Well,\r\nthen, in the name of God.'  That is, he assented.\" [14]\r\n\r\nHowever, the General Staff remained unconvinced; and Colonel Metaxas, a\r\nbrilliant soldier, then Acting-Chief of the Staff, resigned as a protest\r\nagainst military proposals being made by a Greek minister to other\r\ncountries without previous consultation with the military experts of his\r\nown.  M. Venizelos, on his part, was indignant that mere soldiers should\r\npresume to meddle with the plans of statesmen; his view being that the\r\nStaff's business was simply to carry out the policy of the Government.\r\nNevertheless, impressed by this resignation, he suggested the meeting of\r\na Crown Council composed of all the ex-Premiers, that their opinions\r\nmight be heard.  The Council met on 3 March and again on 5 March.  At the\r\nfirst sitting M. Venizelos admitted that the objections of the military\r\nexperts, without altering his own convictions, might still inspire doubt\r\nas to which policy was preferable: neutrality or intervention.  Should\r\nthe policy of neutrality be adopted, it must be carried on by a new\r\nCabinet, to which he would accord his parliamentary support.  At the\r\nsecond sitting he endeavoured to remove the objections of the military\r\nexperts by reducing his proposed contribution to the {30} Gallipoli\r\nexpedition from three divisions to one, which should be replaced in the\r\nexisting cadres by a division of reserves, so as to leave the Greek Army\r\npractically intact against a possible attack from Bulgaria.  And having\r\nthus modified the conditions of intervention, he refused to entertain any\r\nother policy or to support a Cabinet pledged to neutrality.[15]\r\n\r\nMomentarily infected by the Cretan's enthusiasm, nearly all present urged\r\nupon the King the acceptance of his proposal; one of them, M. Rallis,\r\neven going so far as to say: \"Sire, pray consider that you have a\r\nGovernment clothed with the full confidence of the nation.  Let it carry\r\nout its policy.  Else, you will incur undue responsibility.\"  The King's\r\nanswer was: \"If you wish it, I will abdicate.\" [16]  He would rather give\r\nup his crown than assume the responsibility of sanctioning a policy which\r\nhis whole military training and experience told him was insane and\r\nsuicidal: how justly, the event soon showed.  The losses of men and ships\r\nwhich Gallipoli cost far exceeded the whole of Greece's military and\r\nnaval resources; and if that cost proved more than embarrassing to\r\nEngland and France, it would have literally ruined Greece.  M. Rallis and\r\nthe other ex-Premiers in less than a fortnight gratefully recognised the\r\njustness of the King's opposition to their views,[17] and thenceforth\r\nparted company with M. Venizelos.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile M. Venizelos hastened from the Palace to the British Legation,\r\nand, \"in order to save time till he could make an official _démarche_,\"\r\nhe made to the Entente Ministers there assembled a semi-official\r\ncommunication to this effect: \"Following the natural evolution of its\r\npolicy of solidarity with the Entente Powers, the Royal Government has\r\njudged that the Dardanelles operations afford it a favourable occasion to\r\ntranslate its sentiments into deeds by abandoning its neutrality and\r\noffering its co-operation in that enterprise with the whole of its Fleet\r\nand one division of its army.\"  All this, \"though the King {31} has not\r\nyet given his adhesion.\" [18]  His hurry arose from the belief that the\r\nAllies would reach Constantinople in a few days.\r\n\r\nBut the General Staff still remained unconvinced.  Yes, they said, one\r\ndivision to begin with; but what if the Allies get stuck in the Straits,\r\nas we believe they will be, and call upon us for more?  And, once we join\r\nthem, how can we refuse to supply their needs?  We shall be incurring\r\nunlimited liabilities.  So the King, who had full confidence in his\r\nmilitary advisers, and who could not bring himself to look upon the\r\nGallipoli adventure as a \"serious enterprise,\" [19] declined his adhesion\r\nto M. Venizelos's plan; and M. Venizelos resigned in wrath (6 March).\r\n\r\nThen came the Entente replies to his communication; from which it\r\nappeared that, as in August, 1914, so now the impetuous Cretan ran ahead\r\nof the Powers: that, whilst he was inveighing against everyone who would\r\nnot let Greece co-operate with them, they had not yet even agreed as to\r\nwhether they desired her co-operation.\r\n\r\nEngland regarded the communication as a merely preliminary and\r\npreparatory step, and waited for a definite proposal after the King's\r\ndecision, when she would consult with her allies.  France and Russia\r\ninsisted on the impossibility of Greece limiting her participation to a\r\nwar against Turkey alone: to be an effective partner of the Entente,\r\nGreece must be prepared to fight Austria and Germany also.  France added\r\nthat the question of the participation of Greece in the Dardanelles\r\nenterprise could not be a useful subject of discussion between the Allies\r\nuntil a definite decision by the Greek Government was taken.  Russia did\r\nnot even envisage the usefulness of such a discussion.  M. Sazonow\r\npointedly declared that he did not consider Greek co-operation in the\r\nDardanelles at all necessary, that the question of the Straits and of\r\nConstantinople ought to be settled by the Entente Powers alone without\r\nthe intervention of third parties, and that Russia did not desire the\r\nentry of a Greek army into Constantinople, though she had no objection to\r\nits operating against Smyrna or elsewhere.[20]\r\n\r\n{32}\r\n\r\nSome days later, it is true, M. Delcassé affirmed that he had overcome\r\nRussia's repugnance;[21] but, though it is probable that Russia, yielding\r\nto pressure, would have accepted the participation of Greek troops, she\r\nmade no secret of her satisfaction at not having had to do so: \"We\r\nheartily consent to your receiving large compensations in Asia Minor,\"\r\nsaid the Russian Minister at Athens, in the presence of his British\r\ncolleague, to a high official of the Greek Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\"But as to Constantinople, we prefer that you should not come there; it\r\nwould afterwards be painful for you and disagreeable for everybody to\r\nturn you out.\" [22]\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos knew these views perfectly well, and did not covet\r\nConstantinople: what he coveted, so far as material gains went, were the\r\nlarge compensations in Asia Minor.[23]  There lay the chief objective of\r\nhis strategy, and its net outcome was to widen the breach between him and\r\nthose elements in the country which still believed that the policy of\r\nGreece must be governed by the solid necessities of the Balkan situation,\r\nnot by nebulous visions of Imperialist expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Psycha to Venizelos, Bucharest, 23 Oct./6 Nov.; Venizelos to Greek\r\nLegations, London, Bordeaux, Petersburg, 24 Oct./7 Nov., 1914.\r\n\r\n[2] Romanos, Bordeaux, 19 Nov., 1914.\r\n\r\n[3] He explained, three years afterwards, that at the time of making his\r\noffer of 18 Aug., 1914, he bore in mind \"the impossibility of going to\r\nServia's assistance on account of the danger from Bulgaria.\"--_Orations_,\r\np. 93.  But precisely similar was the objection to going against Turkey\r\nwithout a guarantee of Bulgarian neutrality: only the Bulgars, in the one\r\ncase, would have been on Greece's left flank and in the other on the\r\nright.  The truth seems to be that the vision of M. Venizelos lacked the\r\npenetration which, in matters of this sort, can only come from long study\r\nand reflection.\r\n\r\n[4] First Memorandum, 11/24 Jan., in the _Nea Hellas_, 21 March (O.S.),\r\n1915.\r\n\r\n[5] Gennadius, London, 10 Aug.

Venizelos it was decided to\r\ndissolve the Chamber and to have General Elections, in which for the\r\nfirst time the territories conquered in 1912-13 would participate.\r\nMeanwhile, the King called upon M. Gounaris, a statesman of\r\nconsiderable ability, though with none of the versatility of mind and\r\naudacity of character which distinguished his predecessor, to carry on\r\nthe Government and to preside over the elections.  Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances these would have taken place at once.  But owing to the\r\nneed of preparing electoral lists for the new provinces, they were\r\ndelayed till 13 June, and owing to a serious illness of King\r\nConstantine which supervened--causing intense anxiety throughout the\r\nnation and bringing political life to a standstill--two more months\r\npassed before the new Parliament met.  The interval proved fruitful in\r\ndevelopments of far-reaching importance.\r\n\r\nOn its accession to power, the new Government issued a _communiqué_,\r\nannouncing that it would pursue the policy adopted at the beginning of\r\nthe War: a policy of neutrality qualified by a recognition of the\r\nobligations imposed by the Servian Alliance, and a determination to\r\nserve the interests of Greece without endangering her territorial\r\nintegrity.[1] And as the Entente representatives at Athens expressed a\r\ncertain disappointment at not finding in the _communiqué_ any allusion\r\nto the Entente Powers,[2] M. Zographos, Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nin order to remove all uneasiness on that score, instructed the Greek\r\nrepresentatives in London, Paris, and Petrograd to assure the\r\nrespective Governments categorically that the new Ministry did not\r\nintend to depart in any way from the pro-Entente attitude dictated by\r\nhereditary sentiments and interests alike.  The only {34} difference\r\nbetween the Venizelos and the Gounaris Cabinets--the difference which\r\nbrought about the recent crisis and the change of Government--was one\r\nregarding the danger of immediate action, but did not affect the basis\r\nof Greek policy.[3]\r\n\r\nThat, by all the evidence available, was the truth.  M. Gounaris\r\nthought as M. Venizelos thought, as King Constantine thought, as,\r\nindeed, every Greek capable of forming an opinion on international\r\naffairs thought--namely that, if Greece were to fight at all, interest\r\nand sentiment alike impelled her to fight on the side of the\r\nEntente.[4]  The only question was whether she should enter the field\r\nthen, and if so, on what conditions.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos persisted in declaring that the Dardanelles expedition\r\npresented \"a great, a unique opportunity,\" which he prayed, \"God grant\r\nthat Greece may not miss.\" [5]  His successors had no wish to miss the\r\nopportunity--if such it was.  But neither had they any wish to leap in\r\nthe dark.  M. Gounaris and his colleagues lacked the Cretan's infinite\r\ncapacity for taking chances.  Even in war, where chance plays so great\r\na part, little is gained except by calculation: the enterprise which is\r\nnot carefully meditated upon in all its details is rarely crowned with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nAnd so when, on 12 April, the representatives of the Entente signified\r\nto M. Gounaris their readiness to give Greece, in return for her\r\nco-operation against Turkey, the \"territorial acquisitions in the\r\nvilayet of Aidin,\" suggested {35} to his predecessor, M. Gounaris tried\r\nto ascertain exactly the form of the co-operation demanded and the\r\nextent of the \"territorial acquisitions in the vilayet of Aidin\"\r\noffered.  The British Minister replied as to the first point that,\r\nhaving no instructions, he was unable to give any details; and as for\r\nthe second, that it referred to the \"very important concessions on the\r\nAsia Minor coast\" mentioned in Sir Edward Grey's communication of\r\nJanuary.  On being further pressed, he said it meant \"Smyrna and a\r\nsubstantial portion of the hinterland\"--a definition with which his\r\nRussian and French colleagues were inclined to concur, though both said\r\nthat they had no instructions on the subject.  Then M. Gounaris asked\r\nwhether their Excellencies had transmitted to their respective\r\nGovernments M.  Venizelos's interpretation of Sir Edward Grey's offer\r\nregarding its geographical limits.  The British Minister replied that\r\nhe had no official knowledge of that interpretation; he had only heard\r\nof it semi-officially and had transmitted it to his Government, but had\r\nreceived no answer.  The Russian Minister replied that he had\r\ntransmitted nothing on the subject to his Government, as he had been\r\ninformed of it in but a vague way by the late Cabinet.  The French\r\nMinister stated that the subject had never been mentioned to him, and\r\nconsequently he had not been in a position to make any communication to\r\nhis Government.[6]  Thus the grandiose Asiatic dominion of which M.\r\nVenizelos spoke so eloquently dwindled to \"Smyrna and a substantial\r\nportion of the hinterland.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the King, the General Staff, and the Cabinet went on with\r\ntheir work, and were joined by Prince George, King Constantine's\r\nbrother, who had come from Paris to Athens for the express purpose of\r\ndiscussing with the Government the question of entering the war against\r\nTurkey on the basis of guarantees to be determined by negotiations of\r\nwhich Paris might be the centre.  In that order of ideas, they had\r\nalready indicated as the best guarantee the simultaneous entry of\r\nBulgaria, who, according to news from the Entente capitals, was on the\r\npoint of joining.  But this condition having proved {36}\r\nunrealisable--Bulgaria refusing to be bought except, if at all, at a\r\nprice of Greek territory which Greece would on no account pay--they\r\ndropped it and set about considering by what other combinations they\r\ncould come in without compromising their country's vital interests.\r\nThe upshot of their deliberations was a proposal, dated 14 April, to\r\nthe following effect:\r\n\r\nIf the Allies would give a formal undertaking to guarantee during the\r\nWar, and for a certain period after its termination, the integrity of\r\nher territories, Greece would join them with all her military and naval\r\nforces in a war against Turkey, the definite objective of which would\r\nbe the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire; for, unless the Ottoman\r\nEmpire disappeared, the Greek hold on Smyrna would not be very firm.\r\nIt was further stipulated that the Allies should define the territorial\r\ncompensations as well as the facilities regarding money and war\r\nmaterial which they would accord Greece in order to enable her to do\r\nher part of belligerent efficiently.  On these conditions Greece would\r\nassume the obligation to enter the field as soon as the Allies were\r\nready to combine their forces with hers.  All military details were to\r\nbe settled between the respective Staffs and embodied in a joint\r\nMilitary Convention, with this sole reservation that, if Bulgaria\r\ncontinued to stand out, the Greek Army's sphere of action could not be\r\nplaced outside European Turkey.  In an explanatory Note added a few\r\ndays later, at the instance of the General Staff, stress was laid upon\r\nthe ambiguous attitude of Bulgaria, on account of which the opinion was\r\nexpressed that the Allies should be prepared to contribute forces\r\nwhich, combined with the Greek, would equal the united Turkish and\r\nBulgarian forces, and that the sphere of Greek action should be limited\r\nto the west of the Gallipoli Peninsula; but it was agreed that, if the\r\nAllies wished it, they should have the military assistance of Greece on\r\nthe Gallipoli Peninsula too, provided that they landed their own troops\r\nfirst.[7]\r\n\r\nOf these proposals, which were not put forward as final, but rather as\r\na basis of discussion, the Entente Powers did not condescend to take\r\nany notice.  Only unofficially {37} the Greek Minister in Paris, on\r\napproaching M. Delcassé, was told that, since the Hellenic Government\r\nviewed the Dardanelles enterprise in a different light from them, an\r\nunderstanding seemed impossible and discussion useless; for the rest,\r\nthat enterprise, for which England had desired the co-operation of the\r\nGreeks, was now carried on without them, and the situation was no\r\nlonger the same as it was some days before.  Alarmed by this snub, and\r\nanxious to dissipate any misunderstandings and doubts as to its\r\ndispositions towards the Entente, the Hellenic Government assured M.\r\nDelcassé that it continued always animated by the same desire to\r\nco-operate and would like to make new proposals, but before doing so it\r\nwished to know what proposals would be acceptable.  M. Delcassé replied\r\nthat he could not even semi-officially say what proposals would be\r\nacceptable.[8]  But M.  Guillemin, his former collaborator and later\r\nFrench Minister at Athens, then on a flying visit there, advised M.\r\nZographos to abandon all conditions and take pot luck with the Allies.\r\n\r\nThis notion succeeded to the extent that Greece proposed to offer to\r\nenter the war against Turkey with her naval forces only, reserving her\r\narmy for her own protection against Bulgaria.[9]  The Entente Powers\r\nintimated through M. Delcassé that they would accept such an offer,\r\nprovided it was made without any conditions.[10]  Before deciding,\r\nGreece wanted to be assured that the integrity of her territory during\r\nthe War and in the treaty of peace would be respected, that all the\r\nnecessary money and material would be forthcoming, and that the\r\ncompensations in Asia Minor allotted to her would represent\r\napproximately the area indicated by M. Venizelos.  If it was found that\r\non these three points the Hellenic Government interpreted the\r\nintentions of the Entente Powers correctly, it would immediately submit\r\na Note in which the three points would be mentioned as going of their\r\nown accord, so that the official reply of the Entente might cover, not\r\nonly the offer, but also its interpretation thus formulated.[11] {38}\r\nM. Delcassé refused to listen to any points: Greece, he insisted\r\nirritably, should enter the alliance without conditions, coupling her\r\noffer simply with \"hopes to have the benefit of full solidarity with\r\nher allies, whence results a guarantee of her territorial integrity,\"\r\nand \"entrusting the full protection of her vital interests to the three\r\nEntente Powers.\"  The formula was not incompatible with the best\r\nconstruction which one chose to put upon it; and Prince George--who had\r\nreturned to Paris directly after the first offer and acted as a\r\npersonal representative of King Constantine, together with the official\r\nrepresentative of the Hellenic Government--warmly advocated its\r\nadoption, pleading that, if Greece did come in without delay and\r\nwithout conditions, she might safely trust the Allies.[12]\r\n\r\nWhether Prince George's plea sprang from blind faith or from\r\nfar-sighted fear, is a question upon which the sequel may throw some\r\nlight; for the present enough to state that it produced no effect.  In\r\na matter concerning the integrity of national territory acquired so\r\ndearly, King Constantine felt that he could not afford to allow any\r\nambiguity or uncertainty: he was willing to waive the other two points,\r\nbut not that.  He therefore begged his brother to see M. Poincaré and\r\nsolicit in his name the President's help to secure that indispensable\r\nassurance.  \"The essential thing,\" he said, \"is that the Entente Powers\r\nshould give us a solemn promise that they will respect and make others\r\nrespect, until the re-establishment of peace, our territorial\r\nintegrity, and that they will not permit any damage to it by the future\r\nPeace Treaty.  Remark to him that Greece has the right to be astonished\r\nthat friendly Powers ready to accept her as an ally decline to explain\r\nthemselves clearly with her.\" [13]  What was in the King's mind may be\r\nseen from the President's answer: The Powers did not wish to give a\r\nformal pledge in as many words lest the Bulgars should be stirred to\r\n{39} hostile action on realizing that Cavalla was lost to them.[14]\r\n\r\nPrince George, in reporting M. Poincaré's reply, added that the fear of\r\nany damage being inflicted on Greek territorial integrity by the future\r\nPeace Treaty was completely devoid of foundation; that, having himself\r\nexpressed this fear, he had been answered: \"How can you imagine that we\r\ncould dispose of any part whatever of the territory of an allied State\r\nwithout its consent?\" [15]\r\n\r\nThese fair words failed to reassure the Hellenic Government, which,\r\nafter mature reflection, concluded that the formula suggested by M.\r\nDelcassé did not sufficiently safeguard Greece against combinations\r\nlikely to affect her territorial integrity.  Its misgivings, which\r\nsprang in the first instance from the refusal of an explicit promise,\r\nwere strengthened by the reason given by M. Poincaré for that refusal.\r\nConsequently, it regretted that the Entente Powers did not see their\r\nway to come to an understanding for a collaboration which both sides\r\ndesired, and repeated the assurance of a most benevolent neutrality\r\ntowards them.[16]\r\n\r\nThe Greek position was plain: Greece made proposals which constituted a\r\nbreak with the policy pursued deliberately since the beginning of the\r\nWar--proposals for an active partnership, and in return put forward\r\nconditions which ultimately narrowed down to a mere pledge that she\r\nshould not, as the end of it all, find herself robbed of Cavalla.\r\nThere were certain things she could do and, therefore, wished to do.\r\nThere were certain things she could not do, and must be assured that\r\nshe would not be made to do them.  The Entente Powers, on the other\r\nhand, would bind themselves to nothing: which is preferable, they said\r\nin effect, the elaborate letter of a bargaining bond, or the spirit of\r\nspontaneous co-operation; a legal obligation or the natural union of\r\nhearts?  What Greece needs, rather than rigid clauses with a seal and a\r\nsignature, is the steady, unwavering sympathy of her friends.  If you\r\ncome with us in a courageous forward campaign for the {40} liberation\r\nof the world and righteousness, how could we fail to be with you in\r\nevery single question affecting compensations or the integrity of your\r\nterritories?  That's all very fine, said the Greeks.  But----\r\n\r\nThe mistrust of the Greeks was only too well founded.  Although\r\nBulgaria received arms from Austria and allowed the free passage of\r\nGerman munitions which enabled Turkey to carry on the defence of\r\nGallipoli, the Entente Powers, satisfied with her Premier's\r\nexplanations and professions of sympathy, would not give up the hope of\r\nseeing her on their side.  Indeed, they were more hopeful than ever; M.\r\nPoincaré told Prince George he would not be surprised to see that\r\nhappen \"in two or three days,\" [17] and the British Minister at Sofia,\r\nbeing less hopeful and giving proofs of perspicacity, was replaced.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time it came to the knowledge of the Entente Governments\r\nthat the Greek General Staff had resumed its efforts to induce the\r\nServian military authorities to concert measures for their mutual\r\nsafety, pointing out that, the moment Bulgarian troops crossed the\r\nServian frontier, it would be too late.  Whereupon both Servia and\r\nGreece were sternly warned against wounding Bulgarian\r\nsusceptibilities--and threatened with the displeasure of the Powers,\r\nwho wanted to maintain between the Balkan States good fellowship--by\r\nthe unhappy project which was once more to the fore.  And ere the end\r\nof May both States learnt that their territories were actually on offer\r\nto Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThey received the intelligence as might have been expected.  The\r\nServian Premier, after consulting with the King, the Crown Prince, the\r\nCabinet, and all prominent statesmen, informed the representatives of\r\nthe Entente that Servia, in spite of her desire to meet the wishes of\r\nher friends and allies, could not agree to put herself in their hands:\r\nthe Constitution forbade the cession of territory without the sanction\r\nof the National Assembly.  He asked them to understand that this\r\ndecision was final, and that no future Servian Government could be\r\ncounted upon to {41} give a different answer, seeing that the present\r\nGovernment embraced every political party.[18]\r\n\r\nNot less uncompromising was the attitude of Greece.  When the news\r\nreached Athens from Paris, the Hellenic Government could hardly believe\r\nit: \"It is so contrary to the principles of justice and liberty\r\nproclaimed by the Entente Powers--it seems to us absolutely impossible\r\nto despoil a neutral State, and one, too, whose friendly neutrality has\r\nbeen so consistently useful to the Allies, in order to buy with its\r\nterritories the help of a people which has hitherto done all it could\r\nto help the enemies of the Entente.  By what right, and on what ground\r\ncould they mutilate our country?  The opinions once expressed by M.\r\nVenizelos, and since abandoned even by their author, do not constitute\r\na sufficient ground for spoliation.  The whole thing is an unthinkable\r\noutrage: it shows that our fears were justified and our demand for a\r\nguarantee was absolutely indispensable.\" [19]\r\n\r\nFrance, through M. Delcassé, and England, through Lord Crewe, sought to\r\ndispel these fears by formally disclaiming any intention to press upon\r\nGreece a mutilation to which she objected, and explaining that the\r\neventual cession of Cavalla was only envisaged on condition that she\r\nshould consent of her own accord.  M. Zographos, however, who had done\r\nhis best to bring Greece in on reasonable terms, convinced of his\r\nfailure, resigned; and after his departure the Gounaris Government\r\nwould permit itself no further discussion upon the subject of\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nDuring the lull that ensued, the Greek General Staff once more, in\r\nJune, approached the Servian Government with detailed suggestions for a\r\ncommon plan against Bulgaria, dwelling on the necessity of a\r\npreliminary concentration of sufficient Servian troops along the\r\nGraeco-Serbo-Bulgarian frontier to counterbalance the Bulgarian\r\nadvantage in rapidity of mobilization.  These steps proved as barren as\r\nall the preceding: while Servia would not try to conjure the Bulgarian\r\nperil by the sacrifices which the Entente recommended, she could not\r\nprovide against it by entering into arrangements with Greece which the\r\nEntente disapproved.\r\n\r\n{42}\r\n\r\nMatters came to a head on 3 August, when the British Minister at Sofia\r\nmade to the Bulgarian Government a formal offer of Cavalla and an\r\nundefined portion of its hinterland, as well as of Servian territory in\r\nMacedonia, stating that Great Britain would bring pressure to bear on\r\nthose countries, and make the cession to them of any compensations\r\nelsewhere conditional on their consent to this transaction.\r\n\r\nThe shock lost nothing of its intensity by being long anticipated.  M.\r\nPassitch, the Servian Premier, in an interview with the Greek Minister\r\nat Nish, expressed his profound dismay at the corner into which Servia\r\nwas driven; much as she resented this proposal, the fact that she was\r\nentirely dependent on the Entente--whose high-handed methods he did not\r\nfail to criticize--forced her to give it consideration.\r\n\r\nIf Servia had been dismayed, Greece was enraged.  M. Gounaris addressed\r\na strongly-worded remonstrance to the British Minister at Athens,\r\nreminding him that in May his Government had protested against the\r\noffer of Greek territory to Bulgaria, and that both Lord Crewe and M.\r\nDelcassé had disavowed any intention to bring the least pressure to\r\nbear upon Greece, who had thus the right to count on her independence\r\nbeing respected.  The Entente Powers, he went on, thought they could\r\npromise Bulgaria an agreement in which their own will took the place of\r\nGreece's consent, with the idea of exacting her acceptance afterwards.\r\nBut they were greatly mistaken.  The Hellenic Government, voicing the\r\nunanimous sentiments of the people as well as its own judgment,\r\nrepelled with indignation the idea of making the national heritage an\r\nobject of a bargain; and while thanking the Entente Powers for the\r\ncourtesy which inspired their notification, it protested in the most\r\nenergetic and solemn manner against the injury which they proposed to\r\ninflict upon the independence and integrity of Greece in defiance of\r\ninternational law.\r\n\r\nIn reply, the British Government quietly informed the Hellenic\r\nGovernment that the Entente Powers still hoped that Greece would come\r\ninto line with their policy, and that, as soon as Bulgaria had accepted\r\ntheir offer, they would submit a concrete proposal dealing in detail\r\nwith {43} the surrender of Cavalla and defining precisely the Asiatic\r\nconcessions which Greece would receive in exchange.[20]\r\n\r\nThis brings the relations of the Entente Powers with M. Gounaris's\r\nGovernment to an end.  It is a strange record.  We have, to begin with,\r\nthe curious reception of his first offer--the whole Greek Army, the\r\nintervention of which might have turned the Gallipoli tragedy into a\r\nvictory.  Doubtless, there were reasons for declining so considerable a\r\nreinforcement.  We know that, although Russia had modified her\r\nobjection to Greek participation, she still regarded the presence of a\r\nlarge Greek force in European Turkey with disfavour; that the\r\ndismemberment of the Ottoman Empire was not agreeable to France; that\r\nthe Allies could not at that time afford the military contingents\r\nstipulated by the Greek General Staff.  There will be no disposition to\r\nunderrate the complexities of the situation, or want of sympathy for\r\nthose upon whom fell the task of finding a solution satisfactory to all\r\nthe Powers concerned.  But, though these complexities might be good\r\nreasons for not accepting the Gounaris offer, they were hardly reasons\r\nfor not acknowledging it, even in the interest of ordinary courtesy.\r\n\r\nThen came the sterile pourparlers through Paris.  Here, again,\r\npolitical difficulties explain without justifying the attitude of the\r\nEntente Powers.  Their refusal of the guarantee demanded by Greece as\r\nan essential condition of her entry into the war was, of course, a\r\nnatural result of their Bulgarian policy--a policy for which very\r\nlittle could be said.  Time perhaps was, at the beginning of the War,\r\nwhen Bulgaria might have been won; for it is not necessary to adopt the\r\nGraeco-Servian view that she had from the first decided to join the\r\nenemies of the Entente and that no amount of reasonable concessions\r\nwould have satisfied her ambition; the Bulgars are a practical people,\r\nand there was at Sofia a pro-Entente party which might have prevailed,\r\nif the Entente Powers had, without delay, defined the proposed\r\nconcessions and proceeded to press Greece and Servia to make them--to\r\nexpect from either {44} State a voluntary self-mutilation was to expect\r\na miracle.  By not doing so, by shilly-shallying at Athens, Nish, and\r\nSofia, they only lost the confidence of Greeks and Serbs without\r\ngaining the confidence of the Bulgars, who could hardly take seriously\r\nproposals so vague in their formulation and so uncertain of their\r\nfulfilment.  If, on the other hand, the Allies were unable to define\r\nthe concessions or afraid to shock public opinion by forcing them upon\r\nGreece and Servia, then they ought to have dropped their hopeless\r\nscheme, without wasting valuable time, and worked on the lines of\r\nGraeco-Servian co-operation against Bulgaria.  Instead, they squashed,\r\nas we saw, every attempt which the Greek General Staff made to that end.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the only aberration with which history will charge our\r\nstatesmen and diplomats.\r\n\r\nGreece was going through an internal crisis; and those who know Greece\r\nwill know what that means.  In private life no people is more\r\ntemperate, more moderate, than the Greek: a sense of measure always\r\nseasons its pleasures, and even the warmest passions of the heart seem\r\nto obey the cool reflections of the brain.  In public life, by way of\r\ncompensation, the opposite qualities prevail; and as citizens the\r\nGreeks display an astonishing lack of the very virtues which\r\ndistinguish them as men.  The spirit of party burns so hot in them that\r\nit needs but a breath to kindle a conflagration.  That spirit, whose\r\nexcesses had, several times in the past, brought the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Constitution into question, and the country itself to\r\nthe brink of ruin, was once again at work.  Former friends had become\r\ndeadly enemies: the community was rent with dissensions and poisoned\r\nwith suspicions.  Preposterous falsehoods were freely scattered and\r\nreadily snatched at on both sides: the side of M. Venizelos and the\r\nside of M. Gounaris.  Politicians who had been eclipsed by the Cretan's\r\nbrilliance, came forth now to regain their lustre at his expense.  For\r\nlike all men who have played leading parts on the world's stage, M.\r\nVenizelos had gathered about him as much animosity as admiration; and\r\nhate is more enterprising than love.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos and his partisans were at least as resourceful as their\r\nopponents.  The Cretan had never been able to bear contradiction.  If\r\nhis greatness had created him {45} many enemies, his pettiness had\r\ncreated him more.  His tone of prophetic and impeccable omniscience was\r\nvexatious at all times, but particularly galling at this agitated\r\nperiod.  It was now his constant cry that the situation called for the\r\nwork of a statesman and not of an international lawyer or strategist.\r\nThere were times when he declaimed this thesis in so violent a fashion\r\nthat no self-respecting man could work with him.  He had lost all the\r\nable collaborators of the great Reconstruction era, and nothing could\r\nmake him forgive these \"apostates.\"  Everybody who could not see eye to\r\neye with him was to M. Venizelos a traitor.  It was impossible for M.\r\nVenizelos to admit that others besides himself might be actuated by\r\npatriotic as well as by personal motives; that he did not possess an\r\nexclusive patent of sincerity any more than of vanity.  He found it\r\neasier to believe that the alpha and the omega of their policy was to\r\nundo him.  He would undo them--even at the cost of the cause he had at\r\nheart: to see Greece openly on the side of the Entente.  It is not that\r\nhe thought less of the cause, but he thought more of himself.  His\r\negoism was of that heroic stature which shrinks from nothing.  His\r\nnature impelled him to this labour; his privileged position as the\r\nparticular friend of the Entente supplied him with the means.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos had taken a long stride towards that end when he\r\ninsinuated that King Constantine's disagreement with him was due to\r\nGerman influence.  Henceforth this calumny became the cardinal article\r\nof his creed, and the \"Court Clique\" a society for the promotion of the\r\nKaiser's interests abroad and the adoption of the Kaiser's methods of\r\ngovernment at home.  M. Streit, though no longer a member of the\r\nCabinet, was represented as its mainspring: a secret counsellor who\r\nwielded the power, while he avoided the title, of Minister; M.\r\nGounaris, though in name a Prime Minister, was in reality a mere\r\ninstrument of the sovereign's personal policy--so were the members of\r\nthe General Staff--so was, in fact, everyone who held opinions at\r\nvariance with his own: they all were creatures of the Crown who tried\r\nto hide their pro-Germanism under the mask of anti-Venizelism.  Their\r\nobjections to his short-sighted and wrong-headed Asiatic\r\naspirations--objections the soundness of which has been amply {46}\r\ndemonstrated by experience--were dictated by regard for Germany, the\r\npatron of Turkey.  Their offers to fight for the dissolution of\r\nGermany's protégé were not genuine: the conditions which accompanied\r\nthem were only designed to make them unacceptable.  The Entente should\r\nbeware of their bad faith and learn that M. Venizelos was the only\r\nGreek statesman that could be trusted.[21]\r\n\r\nThe Powers who had long since adopted M. Venizelos found it convenient\r\nto adopt all his theories.  M. Delcassé, when called upon to explain\r\nwhy the Greek offer met with such scant ceremony, did so by saying that\r\nit came from M. Gounaris, who was the instrument of the personal policy\r\nof the sovereign, and who combated among the electors M. Venizelos, the\r\nchampion of rapprochement with the Entente; that the proposal for the\r\ndispatch of large contingents to the East, involving as it did a\r\ndepletion of the Western Front, was calculated to please the imperial\r\nbrother-in-law of King Constantine; that the territorial guarantee\r\ndemanded by Greece would have become known to Bulgaria, thrown her into\r\nthe arms of Germany, and precipitated her against Servia, whom King\r\nConstantine intended to leave to her fate; the trick was too gross to\r\ndeceive the Allies, and they gave it the reception it deserved.\r\nLikewise in squashing the Greek efforts to concert with Servia measures\r\nfor mutual safety against Bulgaria, while there was yet time, the\r\nAllies, said M. Delcassé, acted on the advice of M. Venizelos, who told\r\nthem that the Graeco-Servian Treaty was purely defensive: that it did\r\nnot provide for action unless Bulgaria attacked; and what a misfortune\r\nif Servia, by such measures, should appear to take an initiative which\r\nwould give Bulgaria an excuse for the aggression she meditated.\r\nTherefore, they bade Servia devote her whole attention to the security\r\nof her Austrian frontier and not play Bulgaria's game by furnishing her\r\nwith a pretext for attack.[22]\r\n\r\n{47}\r\n\r\nOn this side of the Channel the inventions of M. Venizelos, it would\r\nseem, were accepted as discoveries with equal solemnity.  During the\r\nParis pourparlers, according to the French Ambassador in London at all\r\nevents, England was much annoyed by the Greek Government's hesitations,\r\nwhich she attributed to King Constantine's opposition, and asked\r\nherself whether she could either then or in the future treat with a\r\ncountry governed autocratically.  She was persuaded that Greece lay\r\nunder the influence of Germany, and asked herself whether she could in\r\nfuture support a country which let itself be guided by Powers whose\r\ninterests were absolutely contrary to her own.[23]\r\n\r\nThe Entente Ministers at Athens, as was natural, had greater\r\nopportunities of displaying their solidarity with M. Venizelos.  They\r\nwould perhaps have been better advised had they followed the example of\r\ntheir colleagues at Rome.  It can hardly be questioned that the\r\ndiscreet and decorous aloofness of the Entente diplomats from the\r\nlong-protracted struggle between the Italian advocates of war and\r\nneutrality, assisted by Prince von Bülow's indiscreet and indecorous\r\nparticipation in that struggle, facilitated a decision in our favour:\r\nnothing does so much to alienate a high-spirited nation as an attempt\r\non the part of outsiders to direct its internal affairs.  In Greece the\r\nneed for discretion was even more imperative.  All controversy at such\r\na juncture was injudicious.  But if preference had to be shown, it\r\nwould have been better to have taken the King's side, for all that was\r\nvaluable to us from the military point of view rallied round him; and,\r\nin any case, since the hopes of the Venizelists for oversea expansion\r\ndepended on the goodwill of the Sea Powers, {48} they were tied to us\r\nsecurely enough: so if the land school represented by the General Staff\r\ncould have been satisfied, the country would have remained united and\r\non our side.  Instead of adopting this sane attitude, the local agents\r\nof the Entente ostentatiously associated themselves with the\r\nVenizelists and boycotted the others, thus gratuitously contributing to\r\na cleavage from which only our enemies could profit.\r\n\r\nAnd that was not all.  Having begun by endeavouring to influence the\r\nGreeks, they ended by being entirely influenced by them.  Forgetting\r\nthat no correct perception of facts or estimate of motives is possible\r\nwithout a certain mental detachment, they allowed themselves to be\r\nswallowed up, as it were, in the atmosphere of suspicion and slander\r\ngenerated by party friction: they ceased to have any eyes, ears, or\r\nminds of their own; they saw and heard just what M. Venizelos willed\r\nthem to see and hear, and thought just as M. Venizelos willed them to\r\nthink.  If the King refused to enter the War, his refusal was inspired\r\nby the desire to serve the Kaiser; if he offered to do so, his offers\r\nwere prompted by the desire to dish M. Venizelos.[24]\r\n\r\nHence, every proposal made to the Entente by M. Venizelos's successors\r\nwas rejected.  Greece was kept out of the Allies' camp, and Servia was\r\nsacrificed.  For it should be clearly understood that the fate of\r\nServia was decided in the months of June and July, 1915, not only by\r\nthe development of the Germano-Bulgarian plan, but also by the failure\r\nof all co-operative counter-measures on the part of the Serbs, Greeks,\r\nand Entente Powers while time was still available.  If only there had\r\nbeen anyone of sufficient authority and independence of view to\r\ncorrelate and compose the clashing interests of the moment, a gallant\r\nally might have been saved from destruction.  But those best qualified\r\nto judge of what was coming, and in a position to frame the\r\ncorresponding policy, had been driven into reserve by the storm of\r\ncalumny, whereby their motives were misconstrued, their counsels\r\nderided, and their authority undermined; so that in the general uproar\r\ntheir voices were scarcely heard.  And there were none--or {49} very\r\nfew--to act as intermediaries; for the personnel of the Entente\r\nLegations, \"wholly believing a lie,\" had withdrawn in a body from all\r\nintercourse with them, had nicknamed them \"Boches,\" and were accustomed\r\nto assess as concocted in Berlin every notion that emanated from them.\r\nEven the few members of those Legations who had the moral courage to\r\nwalk the streets without blinkers were subjected to every form of\r\nodious insinuation and attack.  Venizelos in office, out of office, on\r\nmatters technical or lay, to him and to him only would anyone listen,\r\nand as he knew rather less about the rudiments of the military art than\r\nmost people, and refrained from consulting those that did, the results\r\nwere not difficult to predict.\r\n\r\nYet, as late as June, the elements of a good plan were ready to hand in\r\nabundance.  The General Staff was, as stated, continuing its efforts\r\nfor co-operation with the Serbs.  The King, though too ill to conduct\r\nbusiness, would have assented to any military proposal put forward by\r\nthe General Staff.  The people would have followed the King as one man.\r\nAnd the enemy were not ready.  All that was necessary was to study with\r\nattention and sympathy the advice of the experts: to call the soldiers\r\nof the countries concerned to council, and to inaugurate a joint\r\ncampaign.  It was not done--and it is difficult to say now to whom the\r\nfailure proved most disastrous--to Servia, to Greece, or to the Entente\r\nPowers.  But for this failure a proportionate share of blame must be\r\nlaid upon those who, instead of striving to heal divisions in Greece,\r\ndid everything they could to foment them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _White Book_, No. 34.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Conversation with M.

It is both striking and illuminating\r\nthat, while in dealing with the attitude of Bulgaria, the author\r\nconsiders three alternatives: (1) Bulgaria in alliance with the\r\nEntente.  (2) Bulgaria as neutral.  (3) Bulgaria as an enemy of the\r\nEntente.  In dealing with the attitude of Greece he does not for a\r\nsingle moment contemplate more than two alternatives: (1) Greece as an\r\nally of the Entente.  (2) Greece as neutral.  Further, in the course of\r\nthe argument which follows, M. Streit discusses a possible\r\nunderstanding between Greece on the one part and Rumania and Bulgaria\r\non the other, with the object either of a common neutrality or, failing\r\nthat, of a simultaneous entry into war in favour of the Entente, \"on\r\nwhose side alone we can range ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n[5] See the _Nea Hellas_, 22 March (O.S.), 1915.\r\n\r\n[6] _Conversation entre le Président du Conseil et les Ministres des\r\nPuissances de la Triple Entente, 30 mars/12 avril, 1915_.\r\n\r\n[7] Zographos to Greek Minister, Paris, 1/14 April, with the Proposal\r\nof same date; _Orations_, pp. 67-9.\r\n\r\n[8] Romanos, Paris, 17/30 April, 1915.\r\n\r\n[9] Zographos to Greek Legations, Paris, London, Petrograd, 18 April/1\r\nMay, 1915.\r\n\r\n[10] Romanos, Paris, 4 May (N.S.), 1915.\r\n\r\n[11] Zographos to Greek Legation, Paris, 22 April/5 May, 1915.\r\n\r\n[12] Prince George to Zographos, Paris, 24 April/7 May, 1915.\r\n\r\n[13] King Constantine to Prince George, 27 April/10 May, 1915.

To appreciate the community of\r\nsentiments between M. Venizelos and M. Delcassé fully, one must compare\r\nthe above statement with that in _Orations_, pp. 68-9.  The differences\r\nare equally instructive.  The Venizelist orator, prudently suppresses\r\nfrom a Greek audience the fact that his Chief frustrated the General\r\nStaff's efforts to co-operate with Servia; he boldly surmises, on the\r\nother hand, that behind the General Staff's stipulations as to the\r\nsphere of Greek military action lurked the _arrière pensée_ to confront\r\nthe Allies with the risk of provoking Bulgaria, whom they still\r\nregarded as a potential friend: so the stipulations were, as they were\r\nintended to be, unacceptable.  Again, while M. Delcassé, addressing a\r\nFrench audience nervous about the Western Front, reckoned that the\r\nEntente contingents demanded by the Greek General Staff would amount to\r\nat least 600,000 or 800,000 men, M. Politis, less fantastically,\r\nestimates them at 450,000 men: this force, which Greece deemed\r\nnecessary for success, it will be seen, was not far removed from that\r\nwhich France and England eventually wasted in failure.\r\n\r\n[23]Prince George to King Constantine, Paris, 28 April/11 May, 1915.\r\n\r\n[24] See M. Poincaré's statement to the _Matin_, reproduced in the\r\n_Balkan Review_, Dec., 1920, p. 386; Deville, pp. 161, 168-9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{50}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOn 23 August, M. Venizelos returned to power as a result of the General\r\nElections held on June 13.  The outcome of those elections proved how\r\ngreat his popularity still was.  True, in 1910 he had obtained 146\r\nseats out of 182, and now only 185 out of 314.  But the majority,\r\nthough diminished, remained substantial enough to show that he still\r\nwas, for most people, the man who had cleansed Greece.  Nor did M.\r\nVenizelos imperil his popularity by revealing his differences with the\r\nKing.  On the contrary, in his own country, his attacks were carefully\r\nconfined to the statesmen and soldiers opposed to him: the King, M.\r\nVenizelos proclaimed, far from sharing their narrow, unpatriotic,\r\npro-German views, \"did not exclude exit from neutrality under given\r\nconditions, but accepted it in principle as imposed for the serving of\r\nthe national rights.\" [1]  By his organs, too, the King was described\r\nas \"a worthy successor of the Constantines who created the mighty\r\nByzantine Empire--imbued with a sense of his great national\r\nmission--Greek in heart and mind.\" [2]  So anxious, indeed, was M.\r\nVenizelos not to lose votes by any display of ill-feeling against the\r\npopular sovereign that he even took some pains to have himself\r\nphotographed calling at the Palace to inquire after the King's health.\r\n\r\nAs to policy, it is difficult to determine the part which it played in\r\nthe contest.  M. Venizelos refrained from publishing any sort of\r\nprogramme.  His opponents asserted that a vote for Venizelos meant a\r\nvote for war.  But his most prominent supporters declared that such was\r\nby no means the case: although, at a certain moment, he was ready to\r\nparticipate in the Gallipoli enterprise, circumstances had changed, and\r\nhis future course would depend on the situation which he would find on\r\nreturning to {51} power.  This vagueness, though not very helpful to\r\nthe voters, doubtless helped the voting; for there was hardly any\r\npro-war feeling among the masses.  The noble ideals emblazoned upon the\r\nEntente banners produced little impression on their minds.  The\r\nexperience of two thousand years has taught the Greeks that Governments\r\nnever fight for noble ideals, and, if they relieve a small nation from\r\na foreign yoke, it is, as often as not, in order to impose a new one.\r\nTo them the War was a struggle for power and plunder between two\r\nEuropean groups.  It was matter of common knowledge that Constantinople\r\nhad been allotted to the Russians, and the Greeks were not particularly\r\nkeen on shedding their blood in order to place a Tsar on the Byzantine\r\nthrone.  Nor did the Smyrna bait attract them greatly, since it\r\ninvolved parting with Cavalla.  At the same time, the lurid accounts of\r\nGerman frightfulness disseminated by the Entente propaganda, instead of\r\ninflaming, damped still further their enthusiasm.[3]  The Venizelist\r\ncandidates were, therefore, wise in repudiating the allegation that\r\ntheir victory would inevitably mean intervention in the conflict; and,\r\non the whole, the people who voted for the Cretan statesman seem to\r\nhave paid a tribute to his personality rather than to his policy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Servia, under pressure from the Entente, had decided to\r\npromise Bulgaria territorial concessions, and the communication of this\r\ndecision to the Hellenic Government formed the occasion of M.\r\nVenizelos's first official act.  Greece, he wrote in reply, not wishing\r\nto embarrass her friend and ally at a moment when imperative necessity\r\nforced the latter to submit to painful sacrifices, abandoned her\r\nobjections.  But she would be lacking in sincerity if she failed to\r\ntell Servia straightway that \"the _raison d'être_ of the\r\nAlliance--namely, the territorial equilibrium and the mutual guarantee\r\nof their respective possessions--being profoundly affected by the\r\ncontemplated changes, the reciprocal obligations of the Alliance could\r\nnot survive except by virtue of a renewal.\"  M. Passitch replied\r\nverbally that he thought like M. Venizelos.  But, as it happened, the\r\nquestion did not arise; Servia's promise was coupled with so many\r\nstipulations and reservations, that, in the opinion of the Entente\r\nPowers, {52} it amounted almost to a refusal;[4] and the thread of the\r\nnegotiations was very soon broken by events.  Destiny moved too fast\r\nfor diplomacy.\r\n\r\nHardly had these dispatches been exchanged, when Colonel Vlachopoulos,\r\nthe emissary of the Greek General Staff to Servia, arrived in Athens,\r\nbringing a report of the gravest nature.  After twelve months'\r\nevasions, the Servian Minister of War had at last mentioned to him the\r\nneed for an understanding between the two Staffs, and the Servian\r\nDirector of Military Operations stated that Servia, far from being able\r\nto contribute to a common struggle against Bulgaria the 150,000\r\ncombatants stipulated by the Graeco-Servian Convention, could not at\r\nthe moment transport to the northern parts of the Bulgarian frontier\r\nmore than one or two divisions, while as to the southern parts, which\r\nmost immediately concerned Greece, they would have to be left with the\r\neight regiments of 1915 conscripts--that is, raw recruits.\r\nSimultaneously, the fear which the Greek military authorities had\r\nexpressed to their Servian colleagues in the previous spring--that\r\ndelay might prove fatal--was being realized: from all sides came\r\nintelligence of the concentration of large Austro-German forces towards\r\nthe Danube.\r\n\r\nIn the circumstances, after studying Colonel Vlachopoulos's report, the\r\nGreek General Staff submitted to the Government (14 September) the\r\nopinion that for Greece to embark on a war against Bulgaria, so long as\r\nshe was not assured of the co-operation of adequate Servian forces, was\r\ntantamount to courting annihilation; and of such co-operation there was\r\nno prospect: the moment the Serbs found themselves faced by a superior\r\nAustro-German army, the Greeks would have to fight the Bulgars as well\r\nas, in all probability, the Turks alone.\r\n\r\nAs if in confirmation of this forecast, a week later (21 September),\r\nthe Hellenic Government received from Sofia the official announcement\r\nof the conclusion of a Turco-Bulgarian agreement and of Bulgarian\r\nmobilization; the latter measure being, according to the Bulgarian\r\nPremier, purely precautionary: as the Austro-German {53} armies had\r\njust begun an attack on Servia, and the theatre of war approached the\r\nBulgarian frontiers, his country was obliged to take up an attitude of\r\narmed neutrality.[5]\r\n\r\nThe news threw M. Venizelos into a fever of excitement.  He had,\r\nmeanwhile, become most solicitous about Greece-Servian co-operation,\r\nand had not permitted his mind to be impressed by Colonel\r\nVlachopoulos's report.  When Austria and Germany had their hands full\r\nelsewhere, Servia's peril had left him cold; it set him on fire now\r\nwhen they were ready to hurl their legions into the Balkan\r\nPeninsula--when it was no longer for Greece a question of fighting\r\nBulgaria only, but Bulgaria and Turkey and the Central Empires.  M.\r\nVenizelos was a statesman of broad ideas, a hater of dry facts, and an\r\nimpenitent believer in his own star.  For the matter of time he cared\r\nvery little; considerations of odds did not weigh with him unduly; and\r\nhe cherished a sovereign contempt for the cautious attitude of\r\nprofessional soldiers and other uninspired persons.  Never did these\r\nqualities appear more vividly than on this 21st of September.\r\n\r\nAt 5 p.m. M. Venizelos went to Tatoi, the King's country residence, to\r\nconfer with him, having previously arranged that a mobilization Order\r\nshould be drawn up and presented to his Majesty for signature at 6.30\r\np.m., by which time he expected to have finished his conversation.  The\r\nfollowing is a synopsis of that memorable interview based on a report\r\nfrom M. Venizelos's own lips.[6]\r\n\r\nThe King readily agreed to mobilize, but firmly resisted the proposal\r\nto enter the war, on the ground that the odds were too heavy.  M.\r\nVenizelos argued that, even if Germany had five million men available\r\non other fronts, she could not bring them to the Balkans, and\r\nconsequently there was no cause for fear: he spoke learnedly and at\r\nenormous length of geographical conditions and means of transport, of\r\nvictualling, of guns and bayonets, of _morale_--he had allowed himself\r\nan hour and a half.  How the King must have felt under this harangue,\r\nany expert who has had to listen to an amateur laying down the law to\r\nhim on his own subject may imagine.  On finding his military arguments\r\nfruitless, M. Venizelos shifted his ground; though, the military habit\r\nbeing too strong, he {54} could not get away from military phraseology:\r\n\"I was then obliged,\" he tells us, \"to bring forward my heavy\r\nartillery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Majesty,\" I said, \"I have not succeeded in persuading you.  I am very\r\nsorry; but it is my duty, as representing at this moment the\r\nSovereignty of the People, to tell you that you have no right to\r\ndisagree with me this time.  The people by the last elections has\r\napproved my policy and given me its confidence.  It knew that the basis\r\nof my policy was not to let Bulgaria, by crushing Servia, become too\r\nbig and crush us to-morrow.  You cannot therefore at this moment depart\r\nfrom this policy--unless you decide to set aside the Constitution; in\r\nwhich case you must say so clearly, abrogating the Constitution by a\r\nDecree and assuming the responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nThe King replied: \"You know I recognize that I am bound to obey the\r\npopular verdict when it is a question of the internal affairs of the\r\ncountry; but when it is a question of foreign affairs--the great\r\nnational questions--my view is that, so long as I consider a thing\r\nright or wrong, I must insist that it shall or shall not be done,\r\nbecause I feel responsible before God.\"\r\n\r\nAt this utterance, M. Venizelos narrates, \"I remember that a feeling of\r\ndistress came over me, and with clasped hands, I shook my head in a\r\nmelancholy manner, saying: 'Alas! we are before the theory of kingship\r\nby the grace of God: poor Greece!'\" [7]  After a little, he told the\r\nKing that, in the actual circumstances, he could not undertake a\r\nstruggle for the Constitution; he could only tender his resignation.\r\n\r\nThe King expostulated: \"How can you resign in the face of a Bulgarian\r\nmobilization?  In these circumstances, as you know, we must not delay\r\neven twenty-four hours.  After all, who assures us that Bulgaria will\r\nattack Servia?  It is possible that she may maintain an armed\r\nneutrality; in which case our disagreement vanishes, and you can stay\r\nin power and carry on your policy.\"  Whereupon M. Venizelos withdrew\r\nhis resignation.\r\n\r\nOf course, he was not deluded by the Sofia Government's {55}\r\nannouncement of \"armed neutrality,\" and he was determined to go for\r\nBulgaria at once.  But how?  In his own mind, as he had already\r\ndemonstrated to the King, no doubt existed that, if the Greeks attacked\r\nthe Bulgars, they had every chance of crushing them and even of taking\r\ntheir capital.  But there was that General Staff by whose opinions the\r\nKing set such store.  They objected Servia's inability to contribute,\r\nas she was bound by her Military Convention to do, 150,000 combatants.\r\nTherefore, in order to meet this objection, he said: \"Don't you think\r\nwe might ask the English and the French whether they could not furnish\r\n150,000 combatants of their own?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the King; \"but they must send Metropolitan\r\n(European) troops, not Colonials.\"\r\n\r\nBy his own account, M. Venizelos did not take this as meaning that the\r\nKing had agreed, if the English and the French supplied these\r\nreinforcements, to depart from neutrality.  He left Tatoi with a clear\r\nperception of the divergence between their respective points of view:\r\nwhile they both concurred in the need of instant mobilization, one was\r\nfor a defensive and the other for an offensive policy; but, as soon\r\nappeared, not without hopes of converting his sovereign by some means\r\nor other.\r\n\r\nA busy, ambitious child of fortune never lets the grass grow under his\r\nfeet:\r\n\r\n\"I returned to the Ministry at 7 p.m.,\" goes on the curious record,\r\n\"and telephoned to the Entente Ministers to come and see me quickly.\r\nWhen they came, I informed them that a mobilization Order was being\r\nsigned at that very moment and would be published that evening; but for\r\nour further course I needed to know if the Powers were disposed to make\r\ngood the 150,000 combatants whom Servia was obliged by our Treaty to\r\ncontribute for joint action against Bulgaria.  They promised to\r\ntelegraph, and immediately dispatched an extra urgent telegram, adding\r\nthat they would let me know the answer.  This happened at about 8 p.m.,\r\nand at 8.15 there arrived M. Mercati (the Marshal of the Court) with a\r\nmessage from the King, asking me not to make this _démarche_ to the\r\nEntente.  I replied that the _démarche_ had already been made.\" [8]\r\n\r\n{56}\r\n\r\nForty-eight hours later arrived the Entente Powers' answer, that they\r\nwould send to Salonica the 150,000 men asked for.  M. Venizelos, on\r\ncommunicating this answer to the King, was requested by him to tell the\r\nEntente Ministers that, so long as Bulgaria did not attack Servia, and\r\nconsequently the question of Greece going to Servia's assistance did\r\nnot arise, no troops should be sent, as their landing on Greek soil\r\nwould constitute a violation of Greek neutrality.  M. Venizelos tells\r\nus that he communicated the King's wish to the Entente Ministers, who\r\ntelegraphed it to their Governments.\r\n\r\nKing Constantine, it would seem, was left under the impression that the\r\naffair had ended; and the general belief was that the policy of\r\nneutrality still held good; when suddenly the report came that Allied\r\ntroops were on their way to Salonica and that Greece was expected to\r\nassist in their landing.\r\n\r\nThe news would have astonished the Greeks in any circumstances; but the\r\ncircumstances in which it reached them were of a nature to heighten\r\nastonishment into alarm.  Just then (28 September) Sir Edward Grey\r\nstated in the House of Commons, amid loud applause, \"Not only is there\r\nno hostility in this country to Bulgaria, but there is traditionally a\r\nwarm feeling of sympathy;\" and he reiterated the Balkan policy of the\r\nEntente--a Balkan {57} agreement on the basis of territorial\r\nconcessions.  The inference which the Greeks drew from this coincidence\r\nwas that the Entente Powers were sending troops to despoil them on\r\nbehalf of the Bulgars--that they intended to bid for Bulgaria's\r\nfriendship at the twelfth hour by forcibly seizing the parts of\r\nMacedonia which they had endeavoured in vain to persuade Greece to\r\nyield.[9]\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos himself carried the report to the King, inveighing, it is\r\nsaid, intemperately against the Allies: \"I will protest with the\r\ngreatest energy,\" he cried, trembling with anger.  \"I will protest\r\nagainst this unqualifiable violation of our soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the King, \"you must protest very energetically.\"\r\n[10]\r\n\r\n{58}\r\n\r\nAnd M. Venizelos hurried off to his office and drew up the following\r\ntelegram, which, now printed for the first time, reveals many things:\r\n\r\n\"A grave misunderstanding threatens to develop between Greece and the\r\nEntente Powers on the subject of the despatch of international troops\r\nthrough Salonica to Servia.  When I suggested the dispatch of 150,000\r\nmen destined to complete the Servian contingents in case of a common\r\nstruggle against Bulgaria, I did not ask this succour for Greece, but\r\nfor Servia in order to remove the objection raised against our\r\nAlliance, said to have become null by Servia's inability to fulfil her\r\nengagement.  By accepting in principle to proceed to such dispatch the\r\nPowers rendered above all a service to Servia and to their own cause in\r\nthe East.  Likewise, I had clearly specified that, so long as Greece\r\nwas neutral, the landing of international troops at Salonica could not\r\nhave our official adhesion.  Our neutrality imposed upon us to protest\r\nfor form's sake; after which matters would go on as at Moudros.\" [11]\r\n\r\n{59}\r\n\r\n\"It remained for us to take all the necessary measures for facilitating\r\nthe landing and the direct passage to Servia of the international\r\ntroops, combining these operations with the needs of our own\r\nmobilization.  The Minister of Communications was to go at once to\r\nSalonica with a number of engineers to arrange on the spot these\r\ntechnical matters, very complicated from the paucity of means of\r\ntransport in Macedonia.  It was understood that, before any dispatch of\r\ntroops to Salonica, we should have twenty-four hours' notice.\r\n\r\n\"Things were at this point, when the Military Governor of Salonica--on\r\nWednesday--received a visit from the French Consul, the Commander of a\r\nFrench man-of-war, and two French officers from the Dardanelles, who\r\ntold him that, in pursuance of a pretended understanding between the\r\nPremier and the French Minister, they were going to start\r\nreconnaissance work for the landing of French troops and the defence of\r\nSalonica against enemy submarines.  Furthermore, on Thursday there\r\narrived at Salonica General Hamilton with his Staff and notified the\r\nGovernor that the Allies were going to occupy part of the town and\r\nport, and put them in a state of defence with a view to a landing of\r\ntroops.  General Moschopoulos, very firmly though very politely,\r\ndeclared to them that, without orders from his Government, it would be\r\nhis painful duty to oppose any seizure of national territory.\r\n\r\n\"Such a misunderstanding inspires us with the liveliest alarm, for the\r\ncontemplated landing has not yet been definitely accepted, and after\r\nbeing accepted it cannot be carried out, (1) without a preliminary\r\nprotest for form's sake, which the British Government has informed us\r\nit does not want;[12] (2) without the absolute maintenance of the\r\npowers of our authorities, who alone would decide the measures for the\r\nuse of the port and railways in such a manner as not to compromise the\r\ntransport and concentration of our own armies.\"\r\n\r\n{60}\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, the great emotion caused in the public by the recent speech\r\nof Sir Edward Grey compels the Royal Government to demand from the\r\nEntente Powers certain preliminary assurances.  While people here\r\nexpected to see the Powers, after the Bulgarian mobilization, proceed\r\nto decisive acts, and at the very least to a declaration that the\r\nterritorial promises made to Bulgaria in August would be cancelled if\r\nwithin a very short time she did not agree to co-operate with the\r\nEntente, they were stupefied to see that to the most evident proof of\r\nBulgarian duplicity and disloyalty they replied by redoubling their\r\nsolicitude and goodwill.  Sir Edward Grey's speech, followed closely by\r\nthe visits made without notice at Salonica by the representatives of\r\nthe French and British Staffs, gives birth to the fear that certain\r\nEntente Powers may harbour the design of using the troops which would\r\nbe sent to Servia as the fittest instrument for giving practical effect\r\nto the territorial ambitions of the Bulgars in Macedonia.  Well or ill\r\nfounded, this fear exercises over people in Greece, and we have reason\r\nto believe in Servia also, a demoralizing effect and threatens to\r\ncompromise the success of our mobilization.\r\n\r\n\"The Royal Government finds itself confronted with a situation created\r\nmuch against its will, which imposes upon it the duty, in order to calm\r\nas soon as possible the alarms of the people now in arms, of asking the\r\nPowers to dispel the fears inspired by their attitude towards Bulgaria\r\nby declaring, if possible, that the offers made to her are henceforth\r\nnull, and that the eventual dispatch of international troops to Servia\r\nwould in no case be turned to the detriment of the territorial\r\nintegrity of Greece and Servia.  Only formal assurances in this sense\r\ncould justify in the eyes of Greek public opinion the Government which,\r\nwhile protesting for form's sake, would agree to facilitate the landing\r\nat Salonica and the passage across its territory of international\r\ntroops destined for Servia.\r\n\r\n\"Please speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the sense of this\r\ntelegram.\" [13]\r\n\r\nFrom the tenor of this interesting document we gather that, while fully\r\naware of the King's attitude, M. Venizelos {61} went on negotiating\r\nwith the Allies for immediate action; and that the Allies proceeded to\r\nact before any agreement had been reached.  To judge by its tone, M.\r\nVenizelos seems to have been annoyed at the Allies' haste as at an\r\nunwarrantable attempt to commit him irretrievably without heeding his\r\nconditions or waiting for his definite consent: so grave a breach of\r\npropriety could not but pain him.  But, however annoyed he might be on\r\nthe surface, at bottom he was doubtless pleased: the move supplied the\r\nbest means for the conversion of his Sovereign--no argument is so\r\npersuasive as an accomplished fact.  That was what really mattered--the\r\nmanner was a detail; and it is impossible to suppose that he meant to\r\nlet his annoyance stand in the way of his high purpose.[14]\r\nThemistocles, to whom the Cretan statesman bears some affinity, it will\r\nbe remembered, forced the Greeks to fight at Salamis by a similar\r\nstratagem.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, does not exculpate the Allies.  Their conduct merits\r\nat least the appellation of irregular.  But when foreign diplomats and\r\nnative politicians become fused into a happy family, it would be\r\nstrange, indeed, if irregularities did not occur.  The whole of the\r\nGreek story is so thoroughly permeated with the spirit of old-fashioned\r\nmelodrama that no incident, however startling, seems out of place.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is something of an anticlimax.  Next day, the French\r\nMinister--from this point onwards France takes the lead and England\r\nrecedes into the second place--had the honour to announce to his\r\nExcellency the Greek Premier the arrival at Salonica of a first\r\ndetachment of troops, declaring at the same time that the Entente\r\nPowers sent it to assist their ally Servia, and that they counted on\r\nGreece, who had already given them so many proofs of friendship, not to\r\noppose measures taken in the interest of a country to which she also\r\nwas allied.[15]\r\n\r\n{62}\r\n\r\nIn reply, the Greek Premier had the honour to declare to his Excellency\r\nthe French Minister that, being neutral, Greece could not authorize\r\nmeasures which violated her neutrality.  The Hellenic Government was\r\ntherefore obliged to protest against the passage of foreign troops\r\nthrough Greek territory.  The circumstance that those troops were\r\ndestined solely to the assistance of Servia, who was Greece's ally,\r\nnowise altered the case; for, before the _casus faederis_ was realized,\r\nthe neutrality of Greece could not be affected by the danger which\r\nmenaced Servia.[16]\r\n\r\nTo return from formalities to realities.  On the same day (2 Oct.), the\r\nBulgarian forces began to mass on the Servian frontier, while the\r\nAustro-German battalions were fighting their way across the Danube; and\r\non the 4th Russia launched her ultimatum on Bulgaria.  This rapid\r\nfulfilment of their own prognostications roused the Greeks to the\r\nhighest pitch of excitement.  But all faith in the Entente had not yet\r\nbeen extinguished.  On the very day on which the Petrograd Government\r\ndelivered its tardy and ineffectual ultimatum at Sofia, at Athens the\r\nChamber held a historic debate, in which M. Venizelos for the first\r\ntime proclaimed that the Graeco-Servian Treaty imposed an absolute\r\nobligation upon Greece to make war on Bulgaria and Turkey; adding--in\r\nanswer to a question, what he would do if on going to Servia's\r\nassistance he met the German and Austrian armies--that Germany and\r\nAustria must be fought as well, if necessary, and backing his thesis\r\nwith those appeals to honour which, whether pertinent or not, seldom\r\nfail to move a popular audience.  The debate lasted till four o'clock\r\nin the morning and ended with a vote of confidence in M. Venizelos's\r\nmilitary policy--a policy which M. Venizelos, a civilian, expounded to\r\nan assembly of civilians as a settled plan, without waiting for the\r\nconsent of the King and in defiance of the technical advice of the\r\nGeneral Staff.  In fairness to the Chamber, it should be added that the\r\nmotion was carried on the assumption that the King was in agreement.[17]\r\n\r\n{63}\r\n\r\nBut we know King Constantine's attitude; and if M. Venizelos hoped by\r\nthese tactics to force his hand, he was speedily undeceived.  No sooner\r\nwas the debate over than the King summoned his Prime Minister and asked\r\nhim to modify his policy or to resign.  Faced by such a dilemma, M.\r\nVenizelos did the only thing he could do--he resigned; and his country\r\nshrank back on to the solid ground of neutrality.\r\n\r\nIt was a narrow escape--how narrow became evident a few hours later.\r\nThe Allies had promised to send 150,000 combatants.  Even if this\r\npromise had been kept, the Allied force would not have been, in any\r\nstrategical sense, an adequate substitute for the Servian contingent.\r\nFor it was not in place for covering purposes or subsequent offensive\r\naction; it was not trained to Balkan fighting; it was not equipped for\r\nmountain warfare; and, coming to the same ports as the Greeks, it would\r\nhave delayed the process of concentration.  But, be that as it may, the\r\npromise was not kept.  What is more, it could not possibly have been\r\nkept.  Politicians casting about for arguments wherewith to back their\r\nviews may leave their hearers to imagine that Great Powers keep armies\r\nready to be planked down at any point at a moment's notice; but the\r\nfact is that an army, even if it can be spared from other tasks, is a\r\ncumbrous affair to move about, requiring all sorts of tiresome\r\nthings--food, arms, ammunition--the provision of which requires, in its\r\nturn, complicated processes, before the army is potentially effective\r\nfor the role assigned to it in the creative mind of an excited orator.\r\nSomething of the sort had, indeed, been intimated to the Hellenic\r\nGovernment by the Entente Powers themselves when they wished both\r\nGreeks and Serbs to avert Bulgarian hostility by territorial\r\nconcessions--namely, that, as after the commitment of troops to\r\nGallipoli, none remained to rescue Servia, there was nothing for it but\r\nto conciliate Bulgaria.  Of course, it may be asked, such being the\r\nfacts, what value had the promise of 150,000 men?  This {64} is a\r\nquestion which M. Venizelos would have done well to ponder, as King\r\nConstantine and his military advisers pondered it.  As it was, when\r\nthat afternoon the Allied forces turned up at Salonica, the Greek\r\npeople had the mortification to find that they amounted to 20,000.  Nor\r\ndid they approach the stipulated figure for months after.\r\n\r\nThe arguments which had prevailed with many some hours before were\r\nsuddenly exploded, and to the feeling of confidence which had prompted\r\nthe Chamber's vote immediately succeeded a feeling of panic.  What!\r\ncried everybody at Athens, are we to stake our liberty--our national\r\nexistence--on such a chance: 150,000 Greeks, _plus_ 200,000\r\nhalf-exhausted Serbs, _plus_ 20,000 Allies, against 200,000\r\nAustro-Germans, _plus_ 300,000 Bulgars, _plus_ 100,000 Turks?  Nay, if\r\nthe French and the English love gambling, we don't: we cannot afford\r\nthe luxury.  Venizelos has allowed himself to be duped, said some;\r\nothers, Venizelos has tried to dupe us.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances under which the Allies landed at Salonica.\r\nTheir action has been pronounced immoral and perfidious by some English\r\nand even by some French critics; and as it was attended with ill\r\nsuccess, it brought double shame upon the contrivers.[18]  Certainly,\r\nit will not bear investigation from the standpoint of political tact:\r\nit was the first of the many performances which little by little\r\nalienated a friendly nation from them and discredited M. Venizelos with\r\nhis countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] M. Venizelos in the _Nea Hellas_, 22 March (O.S.), 1915.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[3] Deville, p. 174.\r\n\r\n[4] Venizelos to Greek Legation, Nish, 18/31 Aug.; Alexandropoulos,\r\nNish, 19 Aug./1 Sept.; 20 Aug./2 Sept.; 22 Aug./4 Sept., 1915.\r\n\r\n[5] _White Book_, No. 41.\r\n\r\n[6] _Orations_, pp. 131-8.\r\n\r\n[7] This utterance, for the exactness of which we have to rely entirely\r\non M. Venizelos's memory, was the origin of the charge henceforth\r\nbrought against King Constantine that he claimed to reign by Divine\r\nRight.\r\n\r\n[8] According to another and ampler version of these events, it had\r\nbeen agreed between the King and M. Venizelos that, while the latter\r\nopened conversations with the British and French Ministers about the\r\npossibility of sending 150,000 combatants, the former should\r\nsimultaneously open conversations with the German Emperor relating the\r\nsteps taken in regard to the Entente, and asking what Germany would\r\ngive for Greek neutrality.  But when M. Venizelos returned to Athens,\r\nhe sent a letter to the King informing him that he had changed his mind\r\nand that, as a responsible Minister, he could not sanction the\r\nprojected negotiations with Germany.  Whereupon the King forwarded by\r\nM. Mercati a reply that, in such a case, he retracted the permission to\r\napproach the Entente with regard to reinforcements.  See the _Balkan\r\nReview_, Dec., 1920, pp. 387-8.  Yet another version supplies some\r\nadditional details: M. Venizelos assured M. Mercati that his _démarche_\r\nwas of a strictly personal character and did not commit the State in\r\nthe least; next day he repeated this assurance to the King himself and,\r\nat the King's instance, promised to cancel the _démarche_; and two days\r\nafterwards the French Minister, M. Guillemin, formally declared to the\r\nKing that M. Venizelos's _démarche_ was considered as null and\r\nvoid--_nulle et non avenue_.--See S. Cosmin's _Diplomatic et Presse\r\ndans l'Affaire Grecque_ (Paris, 1921), pp. 123-4.\r\n\r\n[9] The Greek Ministers abroad had for some time been informing their\r\nGovernment of a contemplated occupation by Allied troops of the\r\nterritories which were to be ceded to Bulgaria; and the suspicion that\r\na dispatch of Entente Forces to Salonica might have for its object\r\n\"really to occupy for Bulgaria, until the conclusion of peace, the\r\nterritories coveted by her,\" has been expressed even by a French\r\ndiplomat.--See Deville, p. 129, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[10] I venture to borrow this little scene from S. Cosmin, p. 125.  M.\r\nVenizelos at this stage of the proceedings is more eloquent than\r\ncoherent.  He tells us (_Orations_, p. 139), that on informing the King\r\nthat the Allied troops were on their way to Salonica, his Majesty said:\r\n\"That's all right.  Only please let your protest be in any case,\r\nemphatic,\" and that he replied: \"Emphatic--yes, but only up to a\r\ncertain point, considering what lies beneath.\"  Now, as on M.\r\nVenizelos's own showing, the King was no party to the Allies' step, it\r\nis not very easy to see how he could have spoken to him as if the King\r\nhad a secret understanding with them.  The episode is one on which more\r\nlight could be shed with advantage.  The same may be said of an\r\nallegation that King Constantine secretly informed Bulgaria that, even\r\nin the event of an attack on Servia, she would meet with no opposition\r\nfrom Greece.  This allegation is supported chiefly by a telegraphic\r\ndispatch from the Bulgarian Minister at Athens to Sofia (_White Book_,\r\nNo. 43), which somehow (it is not stated how) fell into the hands of M.\r\nVenizelos's friends and was produced by them in the Skouloudis Inquiry.\r\nThe authenticity of this document was publicly denied by its alleged\r\nauthor, and its portentous length (three large pages of close print),\r\nas well as its unusual style render it very suspicious: it begins:\r\n\"To-day, 9th instant,\" and it is dated \"23\"--as if the author did not\r\nknow that the difference between the Old and New Calendar was 13 days.\r\nIn face of these difficulties, strong evidence would be required to\r\nestablish its genuineness: the more because that Inquiry witnessed a\r\nnumber of similar curiosities--among them an alleged dispatch from the\r\nTurkish Minister at Athens to the Grand Vizier, regarding the\r\nconclusion of a secret Graeco-Turkish treaty.  When challenged, M.\r\nSkouloudis declared that such treaty never was even thought of and\r\ndenounced the dispatch as \"from beginning to end a forgery,\" whereupon\r\nnothing more was said.  (See Skouloudis's _Apologia_, pp. 85-8).  These\r\nmatters are of interest as illustrating the atmosphere of mistrust that\r\npoisoned Greek politics at this period, and particularly the relations\r\nbetween the King of Greece and her leading politician.\r\n\r\n[11] In pursuance of a decision taken by the War Council on 16 Feb., a\r\nBritish force was sent to Lemnos to support the naval attack on the\r\nDardanelles, landing at Moudros on 6 March.  Greece told the British\r\nGovernment that she considered the action irreconcilable with her\r\nposition as a neutral.  The British Government justified it by saying\r\nthat, as Turkey had not accepted the verdict of the Powers whereby\r\nLemnos and the other islands conquered in 1912 were assigned to Greece,\r\nEngland had the right to treat them as Turkish territory: at the same\r\ntime declaring that this did not entail any diminution of Greek\r\nsovereignty.  Thus, whilst Turkey was a friend, the British Government\r\nhad decided that these islands did not belong to her; it recognized her\r\nclaim to them when she became an enemy; but not altogether--only for\r\nthe duration of the War: it was merely a temporary expedient to meet a\r\ntemporary exigency.  By the same line of reasoning, England in the\r\nfollowing July justified the occupation of Mytilene.  The Greek answer\r\nwas that \"without consenting to the occupation of part of her territory\r\nor admitting the arguments put forward by the British Government to\r\njustify its action from the standpoint of International Law, Greece had\r\nto bow before an accomplished fact.\"--Elliot to Greek Premier, Athens,\r\n9 March, 25 July; Minister for Foreign Affairs to Greek Legations,\r\nLondon and Paris, 16/29 July, 1915.\r\n\r\n[12] Sir Edward Grey objected to a protest because it would enable\r\nGermany to say that we had violated Greek neutrality.--Gennadius,\r\nLondon, 29 Sept., 1915.\r\n\r\n[13] Venizelos to Greek Legations, London, Paris, Petrograd, Rome, 18\r\nSept./1 Oct. 1915.

Venizelos had insisted that the reports spread through the\r\nPress concerning the divergence of views between him and the Crown\r\nshould be contradicted, and, by telling the King that otherwise the\r\nmobilization would have no effect on Bulgaria, had obtained the King's\r\npermission to publish a _communiqué_ in which he stated that \"the Crown\r\nis in accord with the responsible Government not only as regards\r\nmobilization but also as regards future policy.\"--_Orations_, p. 136.\r\n\r\n[18] See House of Commons Debate, in _The Times_, 19 April, 1916;\r\nChambre des Deputés, secret debate of 20 June, 1916, in the _Journal\r\nOfficiel_, p. 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{65}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nM. Zaimis formed a Government pledged to the policy which Greece had\r\npursued since the beginning of the European War: her future course\r\nwould be guided by the course of events: meanwhile, she would seek to\r\nsafeguard her vital interests by remaining armed.[1]\r\n\r\nAs regards Servia, the new Premier had an opportunity of expressing his\r\nviews at length soon after his accession to office.  The Servian\r\nGovernment, judging that the imminent attack from Bulgaria realized the\r\n_casus faederis_, asked him if, in conformity with her alliance, Greece\r\nwould be ready to take the field.  M. Zaimis answered that the Hellenic\r\nGovernment was very sorry not to be able to comply with the Servian\r\ndemand so formulated.  It did not judge that in the present conjuncture\r\nthe _casus faederis_ came into play.  The Alliance, concluded in 1913,\r\nfor the purpose of establishing an equilibrium of forces between the\r\nBalkan States, had a purely Balkan character and nowise applied to a\r\ngeneral conflagration.  Both the Treaty and the Military Convention\r\naccompanying it showed that the contracting parties had in view only\r\nthe case of an isolated attack by Bulgaria against one of them.\r\nNowhere was there any allusion to a concerted attack by two or more\r\nPowers.  Nor could it be otherwise: it would have been an act of mad\r\npresumption for either of the contracting parties to offer the other\r\nthe manifestly powerless and ridiculous assistance of its armed forces\r\nin the case of a war with several States at once.  And such was the\r\npresent case.  If the Bulgarian attack apprehended by the Servian\r\nGovernment took place, it would be in concert with Germany, Austria,\r\nand Turkey: it would be combined with the attack already carried on by\r\nthe two Central Empires: it would be an episode of the European War.\r\n{66} The Servian Government itself had recognized this in advance by\r\nbreaking off diplomatic relations with Bulgaria in imitation of the\r\nEntente Powers, her European Allies, without a previous understanding\r\nwith Greece, her Balkan ally.  In these circumstances, the Hellenic\r\nGovernment was convinced that no obligation weighed upon it.\r\n\r\nFurther, Greece was persuaded that her armed assistance freely offered\r\nat such a moment would ill serve the common interest of the two\r\ncountries.  Greece had remained neutral in the European War, judging\r\nthat the best service she could render Servia was to hold in check\r\nBulgaria by keeping her forces intact and her communications open.  The\r\ncommon interest demanded that the Greek forces should continue in\r\nreserve for better use later on: that Greece should remain neutral and\r\narmed, watching the course of events carefully with the resolution to\r\nguard in the best possible way, not only her own vital interests, but\r\nalso those which she had in common with Servia.\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic Government, while deeply and sincerely regretting that it\r\nwas materially impossible for it to do at present more for Servia,\r\nwished to assure her that, faithful to their friendship, it would\r\ncontinue to accord her every assistance and facility consistent with\r\nits international position.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Entente Powers took no exception to this attitude; which is not to\r\nbe wondered at, seeing that they had hitherto uniformly ignored the\r\nGraeco-Servian Treaty, and, by their project of territorial concessions\r\nto Bulgaria, had laboured, as much as in them lay, to annul a pact made\r\nfor the defence of the territorial _status quo_ against Bulgaria: not\r\nuntil Bulgaria had been at open war with Servia for some days (14\r\nOct.), could they bring themselves to declare that the promises of\r\nServian and Greek territory which they had made to her no longer held.\r\nUnable, therefore, to tell Greece that she was under any obligation to\r\nenter the War on Servia's behalf, Sir Edward Grey attempted to induce\r\nher to do so for her own benefit by offering her the island of Cyprus.\r\nThis offer, made on 17 October, Greece felt compelled to decline: what\r\nwould it have profited her to gain Cyprus and lose Athens?  And what\r\ncould an acceptance have profited Servia either?  As {67} M. Zaimis\r\nsaid, by intervening at that moment Greece would perish without saving\r\nServia.\r\n\r\nServia could have been saved had an Anglo-French expedition on an\r\nadequate scale taken place at any of the times which the Greek General\r\nStaff proposed for Graeco-Servian co-operation--indeed, at any time\r\nexcept only the particular time chosen by the Entente.  When their\r\ntroops arrived at Salonica, the Servian army--what had been left of it\r\nafter fourteen months' fighting and typhus--was already falling back\r\nbefore the Austro-Germans, who swarmed across the Drina, the Save, and\r\nthe Danube, occupied Belgrade and pushed south (6-10 Oct.), while the\r\nBulgars pressed towards Nish (11-12 Oct.).  On the day on which the\r\nEnglish offer was made (17 Oct.), the Austro-Germans were fifteen miles\r\nsouth of Belgrade, and by the 2nd of November there was no longer any\r\nServia to save, the Bulgars having on that day entered Monastir.\r\n\r\nThe co-operation of Greece might still have been obtained if the Allies\r\ncould even then have sent to Salonica forces large enough to assure her\r\nthat the struggle would be waged on more equal terms.[3]  There had\r\nalways been an influential group among the principal military leaders\r\nat Athens who held that it was to the vital interest of their country\r\nthat Bulgaria should be attacked, and who, to secure the help of the\r\nEntente Powers against Bulgarian pretensions in the future, were\r\nprepared to run great immediate risks.  As it was, the dilatoriness of\r\nthe Allies imposed upon M. Zaimis a policy of inaction.\r\n\r\nThis policy, besides being imposed by circumstances, also accorded with\r\nthe new Premier's character.\r\n\r\nM. Zaimis stands out in the political world of Greece as a singular\r\nanomaly: a politician who never made speeches and never gave\r\ninterviews: a silent man in a country where every citizen is a born\r\norator: an unambitious man in a country where ambition is an endemic\r\ndisease.  To find a parallel to his position, one must go back to the\r\ndays when nations, in need of wise guidance, implored reluctant sages\r\nto undertake the task of guiding them.  This thankless task M. Zaimis\r\nperformed several times to everybody's temporary satisfaction.  On the\r\npresent, as on other occasions, he enjoyed the confidence of the\r\nEntente Powers, {68} as well as the confidence of the King and the\r\npeople of Greece.  Even the journals of M. Venizelos, and the\r\nAnglo-French Press which M. Venizelos inspired, paid the customary\r\ntribute to M. Zaimis's integrity and sagacity.  The homage was due to\r\nthe fact that M. Zaimis was neither a Venizelist nor an\r\nanti-Venizelist, but simply a Zaimist.  In domestic affairs he belonged\r\nto no party; in foreign affairs to no school: he neither sought nor\r\nshunned a change of course.\r\n\r\nThat explains why he succeeded in ruling Greece for four weeks, and\r\nalso why he failed to rule her longer.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos had not abandoned his standpoint.  Of M. Zaimis's person\r\nhe spoke with much respect; but of his policy he spoke just as one\r\nmight have expected M. Venizelos to speak: M. Zaimis had broken the\r\nServian Treaty and would go down to history as a man who had\r\ndishonoured the signature of Greece.  With regard to the Entente\r\nPowers, M. Venizelos thought that M. Zaimis meant honestly--the fact\r\nthat he was as well known to them as M. Venizelos himself, having\r\nserved as their High Commissioner in Crete for two years (1906-08),\r\nexempted him from the imputation of duplicity--and since the Entente\r\nPowers tolerated him, he would do likewise.  He only taunted the Zaimis\r\nGovernment in Parliament for not obtaining for its policy a price from\r\nthose whom that policy unintentionally helped: Greece, to be sure, did\r\nnot remain neutral to serve Germany's but her own interests,\r\nnevertheless, as Germany benefited by that neutrality, she should be\r\nasked to give a _quid pro quo_.[4]\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that M. Venizelos expressed this idea.  At\r\nthe Crown Council of 3 March he had suggested, if his own policy of\r\nintervention was not adopted, to ask from Germany compensations for the\r\ncontinuance of neutrality; and he urged that the King should personally\r\nbargain with the Kaiser's Minister.  Again on 21 September, when\r\nsounding the Entente Powers on the {69} possibility of sending troops\r\nto Salonica, he advised the King simultaneously to sound the German\r\nEmperor on the price of neutrality.[5]  King Constantine had always\r\nshrunk from entering into any understanding whatever with Germany.\r\nAnd, although the advice may have been given in good faith, it is easy\r\nto guess the use to which its acceptance might be turned by M.\r\nVenizelos, who, even as it was, did not hesitate to whisper of\r\n\"pledges\" given to Germany.  So M. Zaimis endured the taunt and avoided\r\nthe trap.\r\n\r\nThis state of truce lasted for a month.  Then strife broke out afresh.\r\nEarly in November a member of the Government insulted the Opposition.\r\nThe Opposition demanded his dismissal.  This was refused and matters\r\nwere pushed to a crisis--whether by the adversaries of M. Venizelos,\r\nanxious to get rid of a Chamber with a hostile majority, or by M.\r\nVenizelos himself, anxious to get rid of a Cabinet that had succeeded\r\nin establishing friendly relations with the Entente, it is impossible\r\nto say.  Both conjectures found favour at the time, and both seem\r\nprobable.[6]  In any case, M. Venizelos made of that incident an\r\noccasion for an attack on the Government's foreign policy, which,\r\nending in an adverse vote, led to the resignation of M. Zaimis and the\r\nformation of a new Ministry under M. Skouloudis (7 November).\r\n\r\nThere ensued a dissolution of the Chamber (11 November) and a fresh\r\nappeal to the people; the King, on the advice of M. Skouloudis,\r\ninviting M. Venizelos to the polls, as who should say: When you got\r\nyour majority in June, the nation was with you; many things of the\r\ngravest national concern have happened since; let us see if the nation\r\nis with you now.  M. Venizelos declined the invitation: \"The\r\nelections,\" he said, \"will be a farce.  All my supporters are detained\r\nvoteless under arms, and the only votes cast will be those of the older\r\nand more timid men.\"  How many supporters he had under arms the near\r\nfuture was to show.  Meanwhile, he and his partizans reinforced this\r\nreason for abstention from the polls with other arguments.\r\n\r\n{70} King Constantine, they alleged, was guilty of unconstitutional\r\nbehaviour.  He had twice disagreed with a Government supported by a\r\nmajority of the representatives of the people, and twice within a few\r\nmonths had dissolved a Parliament duly chosen by the people.  Was such\r\na thing ever heard in a constitutional State?  The Constitution had\r\nbeen violated: openly, insolently violated.\r\n\r\nIn Greece this cry has always been among the Opposition's common\r\nstock-in-trade: it is enough for a Minister to misapply fifty drachmas\r\nto acquire the title of a violator of the Constitution, and nobody ever\r\nis the wiser or the worse for it.  M. Venizelos himself had often been\r\naccused by his opponents of aiming at the subversion of Parliamentary\r\nGovernment.  But in this instance the cry was destined to have, as we\r\nshall see, epoch-making results, and for this reason it merits serious\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe King's supporters denied that any violation of the Constitution had\r\ntaken place.  The Constitution of Greece, they pointed out, gives the\r\nCrown explicitly the right to dismiss Ministers and to dissolve\r\nChambers.[7]  M. Venizelos himself had, no longer ago than 5 March, at\r\nthe second sitting of the Crown Council, declared himself an adversary\r\nof the doctrine that the Parliamentary majority is absolute, and\r\nrecognized the right of the Crown to choose another Government; \"On the\r\nother hand,\" he said, \"the necessary consequence of the formation of a\r\nCabinet not enjoying a majority in the Chamber is the dissolution of\r\nthe Chamber.\" [8]  It was in pursuance {71} of this advice that the\r\nKing, who, as M. Venizelos on that occasion emphatically stated, \"has\r\nalways absolutely respected the Constitution,\" [9] dissolved the\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\nThe only question, therefore, is about the dissolution of the Chamber\r\nelected on 13 June, 1915, which gave M. Venizelos a majority of 56.\r\nThis action, it was alleged, violated the spirit, though not the\r\nletter, of Constitutional Law, because the dissolved Chamber\r\nrepresented the will of the people.  But, the other side retorted, it\r\nwas precisely because there was ground for believing that the\r\nParliamentary majority had ceased to represent the will of the people\r\nthat the King proceeded to a dissolution; and in so doing he had\r\nexcellent precedent.  His father had dissolved several Chambers\r\n(specifically in 1902 and 1910) on the same ground, not only without\r\nincurring any censure, but earning much applause from the Venizelist\r\nParty.[10]  In fact, the last of those dissolutions had been carried\r\nout by M. Venizelos himself under the following circumstances: The\r\nGeneral Elections of August, 1910, had given a majority to the old\r\nparties: King George, however, in the belief that public opinion really\r\nfavoured M. Venizelos, called him to power, though he was only the\r\nleader of a Parliamentary minority.  M. Venizelos formed a Government,\r\nbut, as the majority in Parliament obstructed his policy, he persuaded\r\nthe Sovereign to dissolve it,[11] declaring in the House (11/24\r\nOctober, 1910): that \"it is impossible to limit the prerogative of the\r\nCrown to dissolve any Chamber.\"  Obviously, what was {72} lawful for\r\nKing George could not be unlawful for King Constantine; and the fact\r\nthat M. Venizelos's majority of 56 had since the recent elections\r\ndwindled to 16, was reason sufficient for the belief that he no longer\r\nrepresented the will of the people, even if it were conceded that the\r\nissue of war had been clearly put before the electors who had voted for\r\nhim in June, and that, at best, a majority of 56 in an assembly of 314\r\nwas an adequate expression of the will of the people on so grave an\r\nissue.  Events had moved so fast in those months and the situation\r\nchanged so abruptly that King Constantine would have been guilty of a\r\ndereliction of duty had he not, by exercising his indisputable\r\nprerogative, given the nation an opportunity to reconsider its opinion.\r\n\r\nSophisms suited to the fury of the times apart, the whole case of M.\r\nVenizelos against his Sovereign rested, avowedly, on the theory,\r\nimprovised for the nonce, that the Greek Constitution is a replica of\r\nthe British--a monarchical democracy in which the monarch is nothing\r\nmore than a passive instrument in the hands of a Government with a\r\nParliamentary majority.[12]  It is not so, and it was never meant to be\r\nso.  The Greek Constitution does invest the monarch with rights which\r\nour Constitution, or rather the manner in which we have for a long time\r\nchosen to interpret it, does not.  Among these is the right to make, or\r\nto refrain from making war.  That was why M. Venizelos in March, 1915,\r\ncould not offer the co-operation of Greece in the Dardanelles\r\nenterprise officially without the King's approval, and why the British\r\nGovernment declined to consider his semi-official communication until\r\nafter the King's decision.  Similarly M. Venizelos's proposals for the\r\ndispatch of Entente troops to Salonica in September, so far as that\r\ntransaction was carried on above-board, were made subject to the King's\r\nconsent.  Of course, if the King exercised this right without advice,\r\nhe would be playing the part of an autocrat; but King Constantine\r\nalways acted by the advice of the competent authority--namely, the\r\nChief of the General Staff.  In truth, if anyone tried to play the part\r\nof an autocrat, it was not the King, but M. Venizelos.  His argument\r\nseemed to be that the King should acquiesce in the view {73} which a\r\nlay Minister took of matters military and in decisions which he arrived\r\nat without or in defiance of technical advice.\r\n\r\nIn this again, M. Venizelos appears to have been inspired by British\r\nexample.  We saw during the War the responsibility for its conduct\r\nscattered over twenty-three civil and semi-civil individuals who\r\nconsulted the naval and military staffs more or less as and when they\r\nchoose, and the result of it in the Gallipoli tragedy.  We saw, too, as\r\na by-product of this system, experts holding back advice of immense\r\nimportance because they knew it would not be well received.  The\r\nReports of the Dardanelles Commission condemned this method.  But it is\r\nto a precisely similar method that the Greek General Staff objected\r\nwith such determination.  \"Venizelos,\" they said, \"does not know\r\nanything about war.  He approaches the King with proposals containing\r\nin them the seeds of national disaster without consulting us, or in\r\ndefiance of our advice.  Greece cannot afford to run the risk of\r\nmilitary annihilation; her resources are small, and, once exhausted,\r\ncannot be replaced.\"  The King, relying on the right unquestionably\r\ngiven to him under the terms of the Constitution, demanded from his\r\nchief military adviser such information as would enable him to judge\r\nwisely from the military point of view any proposal involving\r\nhostilities made by his Premier.  It was this attitude that saved\r\nGreece from the Gallipoli grave in March, and it was the same attitude\r\nthat saved her a second time at the present juncture.\r\n\r\nBut, in fact, at the present juncture the King acted not so much on his\r\nprerogative of deciding about war as on the extreme democratic\r\nprinciple that such decision belongs to the people, and, finding that\r\nthe Party which pushed the country towards war had only a weak\r\nmajority, he preferred to place the question before the electorate, to\r\ntest beyond the possibility of doubt the attitude of public opinion\r\ntowards this new departure.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever point of view we may examine Constantine's behaviour, we\r\nfind that nothing could be more unfair than the charge of\r\nunconstitutionalism brought against it.  M. Venizelos himself a little\r\nlater, by declaring that he aimed at the \"definite elucidation of the\r\nobligations and rights of the royal authority,\" through a \"new {74}\r\nConstitution,\" [13] unwittingly confessed that the actual Constitution\r\ncould not bear his interpretation.  As things stood, the charge might\r\nwith a better show of justice be brought against M. Venizelos, who, it\r\nwas pointed out, had violated the Constitution by inviting foreign\r\ntroops into Greek territory without the necessary Act of Parliament.[14]\r\n\r\nNor should it be forgotten that King Constantine had suffered\r\ngrievously both as a Greek and as a general from too punctilious an\r\nobservance of parliamentary etiquette by his father in 1897.  At that\r\ndate the policy of M. Delyannis was supported by the whole Chamber.  It\r\nwas a policy which the late Lord Salisbury very aptly summed up at the\r\ntime in the one word, \"strait-waistcoat.\"  But, for lack of a man at\r\nthe top strong enough and courageous enough to take the responsibility\r\nof opposing it, it was carried out: Greece rushed headlong into war\r\nwith a superior power and was smashed.  Upon King Constantine, then\r\nCrown Prince, had devolved the tragic duty of leading the Greek army to\r\nself-destruction, and it was upon his devoted head that afterwards the\r\nnation visited the criminal levity of M. Delyannis.  Was he to suffer\r\ncalmly a repetition of the same catastrophe on an infinitely larger\r\nscale--to see his country trampled under German and Bulgarian\r\nheels--for M. Venizelos's sake?\r\n\r\nThe practical wisdom and patriotism of the King's conduct cannot be\r\nquestioned; but we should guard ourselves against exaggerating its\r\nmoral courage.  King Constantine, in turning an inattentive ear to the\r\nwarlike outpourings of the People's Chosen, knew perfectly well that he\r\nran no risk of wounding the people's conscience--just {75} as in\r\noffering to lay the question before the tribunal of public opinion he\r\nknew that he ran no risk of finding it at variance with his own.  He\r\ncould afford to act as he did, because the country trusted him\r\nimplicitly.  Writing about the middle of November, an English observer\r\ndescribed the situation as follows: \"The people generally are afraid,\r\nwaiting and leaving everything to the King. . . .  No one now counts in\r\nGreece but the King.\" [15]  And the absence of any popular murmur at\r\nthe rejection of the offer of Cyprus, to anyone who knows how deeply\r\npopular feeling is committed to the ultimate union of that Greek island\r\nwith the mother country, speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that M. Venizelos had as yet lost caste altogether.\r\nOn that fateful 5th of October his reputation as a serious statesman\r\namong his countrymen had received a severe blow.  The idolatrous\r\nadmiration with which he had been surrounded until then gave way to\r\ndisenchantment, disenchantment to bewilderment, and bewilderment to\r\ndismay: the national prophet from whom fresh miracles had been\r\nexpected, was no prophet at all, but a mere mortal--and an uncommonly\r\nfallible mortal at that.  Nevertheless, while many Greeks found it hard\r\nto pardon the Cretan politician for the ruin into which he had so very\r\nnearly precipitated them, there were many others who still remained\r\nunder the spell of his personality.  Yet it may well be doubted\r\nwhether, had a plebiscite been taken at that moment, he would have got\r\nanything more than a substantial minority.  Fully conscious of the\r\nposition, M. Venizelos, in spite of advice from his Entente friends to\r\nstand his ground, boycotted the polls, and the new Parliament, returned\r\nby the elections of 19 December, was a Parliament without an\r\nOpposition.  M. Skouloudis remained at the helm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _White Book_, No. 45.\r\n\r\n[2] _White Book_, No. 46.\r\n\r\n[3] See _The Times_, 1 Nov., 1915.\r\n\r\n[4] _Orations_, pp. 143-50.  It would hardly be credited, did it not\r\ncome out of his own mouth, that the compensations and guarantees which\r\nM. Venizelos thought, or at least said, that Greece could obtain from\r\nGermany in return for her neutrality (a neutrality always benevolent\r\ntowards Germany's enemies) exceeded those which the Entente had refused\r\nto grant Greece for her active alliance!\r\n\r\n[5] _The Balkan Review_, Dec., 1920, pp. 384, 387; _Orations_, p. 266.\r\n\r\n[6] It may not be irrelevant to note that the end of the truce\r\ncoincided with the end of the Allies' uncertainty as to whether they\r\nwould persist in the Salonica enterprise or give it up.\r\n\r\n[7] Art. 31, 37.\r\n\r\n[8] Extracts from Minutes in _The Balkan Review_, Dec., 1920, p. 385.\r\nNot for the first time had M. Venizelos expounded that thesis.  Here is\r\na speech of his on 2/15 May, 1911.\r\n\r\n\"We are accused of seeking the destruction of Parliamentary Government,\r\nbecause we conceive that one of the foundations of the Government is\r\nthat those who represent the majority do everything, that it is enough\r\nfor them that they represent the majority to impose their will.  But\r\nwe, the Liberal Party, entertain an entirely opposite conception both\r\nof the State and the Laws and of the powers of majorities, because\r\nmodern progress has proved that humanity cannot prosper so long as the\r\naction of those in authority is not subjected to rules and restrictions\r\npreventing every transgression or violation of justice.  We shall make\r\nthe Greeks truly free citizens, enjoying not only the rights which\r\nemanate from the Constitutional ordinances, but also those which\r\nemanate from all the laws.  _We shall defend them against every\r\ntyrannical exercise of Government power derived from a majority._\"\r\n\r\nThis report is taken from a panegyric on the speaker: _Eleutherios\r\nVenizelos_, by K. K. Kosmides, D.Ph., Athens, 1915, pp. 56-7.  On p. 58\r\nof the same work, occurs another reply by M. Venizelos to a charge of\r\nanti-Parliamentarism, dated 14/27 Nov., 1913.\r\n\r\n[9] _The Balkan Review, loc. cit_.  Cp. _The New Europe_, 29 March,\r\n1917, where M. Venizelos expressly admits that \"in February, 1915, the\r\nKing's action might be regarded as constitutional.\"\r\n\r\n[10] _Orations_, pp. 17-8.  Cp. p. 217.\r\n\r\n[11] His opponents then acted as he did now: to avoid exposing their\r\nweakness, they pronounced the dissolution unconstitutional and\r\nboycotted the new elections.  For a full account of these events see\r\nanother panegyric: _E. Venizelos: his life--his work_.  By Costa\r\nKairophyla, Athens, 1915, pp. 73-82.\r\n\r\n[12] _Orations_, pp. 12-15.\r\n\r\n[13] _Eleutheros Typos_, 23 Oct./5 Nov., 1916; _Orations_, p. 102.\r\n\r\n[14] See Art. 90 of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt was in order to defend himself against this grave charge that M.\r\nVenizelos denied in the Chamber and out of it, that he had \"invited\"\r\nthe Allies to Salonica.  Just as it was in order to avoid the charge of\r\nviolating International Law that Sir Edward Grey in the House of\r\nCommons (18 April, 1916) and M. Briand in the Chamber of Deputies (20\r\nJune, 1916), affirmed that the Allies had been \"invited.\"  From the\r\naccount of that affair already given, the reader will easily see that,\r\nfor forensic purposes, both the denial and the affirmation rest on\r\nsufficient grounds.  The discrepancy might be removed by the\r\nsubstitution of \"instigated\" for \"invited.\"\r\n\r\n[15] J. M. N. Jefferies, in the _Daily Mail_, 23 Nov., 1915.  The\r\ntestimony is all the more notable because it comes from an avowed\r\npartisan of M. Venizelos: \"the only man in Greece with a policy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{76}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA momentous question--upon the answer to which depended, among other\r\nthings, the fate of Greece during the War--confronted the Allies as\r\nsoon as they realized that their Balkan campaign had come to an\r\nuntimely beginning.\r\n\r\nThe dispatch of troops to Macedonia originally was based on the\r\nagreement that M. Venizelos would get Greece to join.  Once M.\r\nVenizelos failed to do so, the plan fell to the ground.  Again, the\r\nobject of the expedition was to rescue Servia; and Servia being already\r\nconquered, the expedition had no longer any purpose.  Such were the\r\nviews of the British Government, and similar views were held in France\r\nby many, including M. Delcassé, who resigned when Bulgaria's\r\n\"defection\" sounded the knell of his Balkan policy.  But other French\r\nstatesmen, with M. Briand at their head, saw in Macedonia a field which\r\npromised great glory and gain, if only the noble British nation could\r\nbe brought to understand that there were interests and sentiments at\r\nstake higher than agreements.[1]\r\n\r\nThe process involved some talking: \"I have had my interview with Briand\r\nand Gallieni,\" wrote Lord Kitchener to the Prime Minister.  \"As regards\r\nSalonica it is very difficult to get in a word; they were both full of\r\nthe necessity of pushing in troops, and would not think of coming out.\r\nThey simply sweep all military difficulties and dangers aside, and go\r\non political lines--such as saving a remnant of Serbs, bringing Greece\r\nin, and inducing Rumania to join.\" [2]\r\n\r\nOther conferences followed, at all of which the French spoke so loudly\r\nthat the noble British nation could not possibly help hearing--_la\r\nnoble nation britannique n'est pas restée sourde_.  The truth is,\r\nFrance was set on what {77} M. Delcassé now called the _mirage\r\nbalkanique_, partly from considerations of a domestic nature, chiefly\r\nfor reasons connected with the future balance of power in the Near\r\nEast--and England could not leave her there alone.  So the \"_nous\r\nresterons_\" policy prevailed; and the continued presence of\r\nFranco-British forces on Greek soil led, as it was bound to do, to\r\nabnormal relations with the Greek Government.\r\n\r\nThe wish of the Allies was to obtain from Greece full licence for the\r\nsafe accommodation and the operations of their troops; while it was the\r\nearnest endeavour of Greece not to let her complaisance towards one\r\ngroup of belligerents compromise her in the eyes of the other.  The\r\nlittle kingdom found itself between two clashing forces: the one\r\ntriumphant on land, the other dominating the sea.  But of the two the\r\nGerman peril was the more imminent.  The Kaiser's legions were at\r\nMonastir--any act that might be construed as a breach of neutrality\r\nwould bring them in a month to Athens.\r\n\r\nM. Skouloudis--a stately octogenarian who, after refusing three times\r\nthe Premiership, had assumed power in this crisis at the King's\r\ninsistent desire because, as he said, he considered it his duty so to\r\ndo--took up the only attitude that could have been expected in the\r\ncircumstances: the attitude that was dictated by the instinct of\r\nself-preservation.\r\n\r\nUnlike M. Venizelos, whose mind revolved constantly about war at all\r\nhazards: unlike other statesmen who regarded war as an eventuality to\r\nbe accepted or declined according as conditions might be favourable or\r\nunfavourable, M. Skouloudis seemed resolutely to eliminate war from his\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nOn taking office he gave the Entente Powers \"most categorical\r\nassurances of a steady determination to carry on the policy of\r\nneutrality in the form of most sincere benevolence towards them.  The\r\nnew Ministry,\" he added, \"adopts M. Zaimis's repeated declarations of\r\nGreece's friendly attitude towards the Allied armies at Salonica, and\r\nis sufficiently sensible of her true interests and of her debt to them\r\nnot to deviate for the whole world from this course, and hopes that the\r\nfriendly sentiments of those Powers towards Greece will never be\r\ninfluenced by false {78} and malicious rumours deliberately put into\r\ncirculation with the object of cooling the good relations between\r\nthem.\"  To Servia also he expressed \"in the most categorical terms\r\nsentiments of sincere friendship and a steady determination to continue\r\naffording her every facility and support consistent with our vital\r\ninterests.\" [3]\r\n\r\nBut at the same time, when told by the Servian Minister that a Servian\r\narmy might probably, pressed by the enemy, enter Greek territory, he\r\nreplied that he wished and hoped such a thing would not happen--that\r\nGreece might not find herself under the very unpleasant necessity of\r\napplying the Hague Rules regarding the disarmament of a belligerent\r\ntaking refuge in neutral territory.  And he repeated this statement to\r\nthe French Minister, adding, in answer to a question.  What would\r\nGreece do if the Allied forces retired into Greek territory? that it\r\nwould be necessary to apply the Hague Rules, but that he hoped very\r\nmuch the contingency would not present itself.  On being reminded of\r\nthe assurances given by his predecessor that no material pressure would\r\never be exerted on the Allied forces, he replied that the Hellenic\r\nGovernment nowise proposed to go back on those assurances, and hoped\r\nthat the Powers, taking into consideration the irreproachable attitude\r\nof Greece, would be pleased to relieve her of complications and find a\r\nsolution safeguarding all interests concerned.[4]\r\n\r\nThe solution he hinted at was that the Allies should re-embark; in\r\nwhich case Greece was prepared to protect the parting guests \"even by\r\nher own forces, so as to afford them the most absolute security.\" [5]\r\n\r\nBut, as nothing was farther from their thoughts, his explanation did\r\nnot satisfy the Allies.  M. Skouloudis was therefore obliged to give\r\ntheir representatives again and again to understand that in no case\r\nwould the Hellenic Government think of exerting the least pressure, and\r\nthat, if he had alluded to the Rules regarding neutrality, he had done\r\nso because such ought to be the official language of a State which was\r\nand wished to remain neutral.  But from the very first he had clearly\r\nindicated that Greece did not mean to apply those Rules: she would\r\nconfine {79} herself to a mere reminder of international principles\r\nwithout in any way seeking to enforce respect for them.  Greece being\r\nand wishing to remain neutral, could not speak officially as if she\r\nwere not, nor trumpet abroad the assurances which she had not ceased\r\ngiving the Entente Powers.  Surely they must perceive the most delicate\r\nposition in which Greece stood between the two belligerent groups, and,\r\ngiven that they did not dispute, nor could dispute, her right to remain\r\nneutral, it was reasonable and just that they should accept the natural\r\nconsequences and not demand from her impossibilities.[6]\r\n\r\nThe Entente Powers could not, of course, deny the reasonableness of\r\nthis plea; but neither could they ignore the inconveniences to\r\nthemselves that would arise from its frank recognition.  Between their\r\nbase at Salonica and the troops which had advanced to Krivolak\r\ninterposed several Greek army corps; at Salonica also Greek camps lay\r\namong the Franco-British camps scattered round the town: these\r\nconditions impeded organized operations.  General Sarrail, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Allies, had nothing but praise for the\r\ncourtesy of the Greek authorities, both civil and military.  Yet not a\r\nday passed without incidents.  He complained that obstacles were placed\r\nin his action through a multitude of secondary details: the\r\nMunicipality claimed duties; the Railway Service did not assist as\r\nliberally as could be wished in the work of getting off the stores\r\nwhich arrived at the port.  It was necessary that the Greek troops\r\nshould be moved out of the Allies' way and leave them in full control:\r\nprivileges which no State could voluntarily grant and remain neutral;\r\nwhich no army could forgo and work efficiently.  So the General, while\r\nconfessing that \"we often place them in a difficult position by\r\ndemanding permissions which their virtual neutrality cannot allow them\r\nto give,\" impressed on the Entente Governments the need of taking\r\nstrong measures with the Greeks.[6]\r\n\r\nGermany would have proceeded to deeds without wasting words--beyond a\r\ncasual \"Necessity knows no law.\"  But nations fighting for noble ideals\r\ncould not imitate Germany's cynicism.  A case had to be made out to\r\n{80} justify coercion.  It was.  Greece did not really wish to remain\r\nneutral.  Misled by a Germanophile Court, she only waited for a chance\r\nof joining the enemy--of stabbing the Allies in the back.  When this\r\namazing theory--widely popularized by the French and English Press--was\r\nhinted to M. Rallis by \"Our Special Correspondent,\" on 18 November, the\r\nGreek Minister could hardly credit his collocutor's sanity: \"It is\r\nmad!\" he cried out.  \"It is senseless to imagine such a thing--when you\r\ncould have the guns of your fleet levelled on our cities!\"  The answer,\r\nhowever--an answer the conclusiveness of which a glance at the map is\r\nenough to demonstrate to the dimmest intelligence--fell upon\r\ndeliberately deaf ears.  The very journal which in one page recorded\r\nit, in another wrote: \"Bulgaria has gone; Greece is trembling in the\r\nbalance.  Only a display of overwhelming force on our part can hold her\r\nsteady and prevent the accession of another 500,000 men to the enemy's\r\nstrength.\"\r\n\r\nThat the publicists who argued thus and who, to give to their argument\r\ngreater cogency, generously added to the Greek army some 200,000 men,\r\nwere persuaded by their own reasoning, it is hard to believe without\r\nlibelling human sense.  Apart from the ocular refutation supplied by\r\nthe map, what had Greece to gain by siding with the enemies of the\r\nEntente?  That she would lose all her islands, have her coast towns\r\npulverized and her population starved, was certain.  What she could get\r\nin return, it needed a very robust imagination to suggest.  The only\r\ncountries at whose cost the Hellenic Kingdom could possibly compensate\r\nitself for these inevitable sacrifices were Turkey and Bulgaria; and\r\nthose countries were Germany's allies.  A moment's reflection raises a\r\nnumber of equally unanswerable questions: If the Greeks wanted to join\r\nGermany, why did they not do so when the Kaiser invited them at the\r\nvery beginning of the War?  Why did they not resist the landing of the\r\nAllies?  Why did they not attack them when they had them at their\r\nmercy: 60,000 French and British, with the Germans and the Bulgars in\r\nfront of them, and 150,000 Greeks between them and Salonica?[8]\r\n\r\n{81}\r\n\r\nIn this connexion the evidence of an eminent English soldier and an\r\neminent French statesman who visited Athens at that time to study the\r\nsituation on the spot may be cited.  To each King Constantine and M.\r\nSkouloudis, in the course of lengthy interviews, declared that the\r\nAllied forces had nothing to fear in Greece.  Each was convinced of\r\ntheir sincerity, and of the true motives of their attitude: \"They\r\nboth,\" reported Lord Kitchener, \"seem very determined to stick to their\r\nneutrality.\"  Likewise General Dousmanis, Chief of the General Staff,\r\nand Colonel Metaxas, who were represented to the Entente publics as\r\nGermanophile pedants, satisfied Lord Kitchener of their genuine concern\r\nabout the British sphere in the East, and startled him by pressing upon\r\nhim a plan of action \"almost exactly the same as detailed in my\r\ntelegrams, and based their conclusions on the same argument almost word\r\nfor word.  They emphatically stated that there was no other way of\r\npreventing the accomplishment of the German project.\" [9]  M. Denys\r\nCochin even went so far as to publish to the whole world that the\r\nsuspicions entertained against King Constantine had no other source\r\nthan party rancour.[10]\r\n\r\nFor the rest, a striking proof that the Entente Powers themselves did\r\nnot believe the story of the Greek Government's hostile intentions is\r\nafforded by the fact that, instead of demanding, they deprecated the\r\ndisbandment of the Greek army.  When Lord Kitchener saw M. Skouloudis,\r\nthe latter said that the Allies' mistrust might well force Greece to\r\nconsider whether it would not be better for her to demobilize, leaving\r\nto them all responsibility for the consequences.  Lord Kitchener, in\r\nthe presence of the British Minister, replied that, \"as to some partial\r\ndemobilization, it was for Greece to decide according to her interests,\r\nbut he did not think a general demobilization advisable.\"  And again, a\r\nlittle later on, when {82} M. Skouloudis, irritated by a fresh\r\nexhibition of mistrust, told the French Minister that, in face of such\r\na state of things, nothing was left for his unhappy country but to\r\norder at once a general demobilization, and let the Entente Powers do\r\nwhat they liked to her, M. Guillemin cried out, \"Ah, no.  I am\r\ndecidedly against demobilization.\"  Naturally: \"the Greek Army,\" said\r\nSir Thomas Cuninghame, the British Military Attaché, to General\r\nMoschopoulos.  Military Governor of Salonica, \"saves and secures the\r\nflanks and rear of the Allies.\" [11]\r\n\r\nHowever, the story served the purpose of supplying a pretext for\r\npressure.  All ships carrying foodstuffs and other commodities were\r\nheld up.  In addition, Milo--an island not far from Athens--was\r\noccupied, and the Allied Fleet was ordered to be ready, in case things\r\nshould be pushed to extremes, to open war on Greek commerce, to destroy\r\nthe Greek Fleet, and to bombard Athens, _en respectant les monuments\r\nanciens_.[12]\r\n\r\nFortunately, the occasion for extreme measures, by which even the\r\nancient ruins might have suffered, did not arise.  General Sarrail, who\r\nat first urged that the naval demonstration against Athens should be\r\nproceeded with immediately, on second thoughts, prompted by nervousness\r\nas to the safety of his troops, deprecated such action.  At the same\r\ntime, M. Skouloudis, alarmed by the blockade--Greece never has more\r\nthan a very limited food reserve--invited the Allies to state their\r\ndemands, saying that he would accede to them if it was possible to do\r\nso.[13]\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Allies, \"ever animated by the most benevolent intentions\r\ntowards Greece, and anxious that the equivocal situation in which\r\nevents had placed her towards them should come to an end and their\r\nrelations be re-established on a basis of mutual and lasting\r\nconfidence,\" demanded first of all a formal assurance that in no\r\ncircumstances would the Greek troops attempt to disarm or intern the\r\nretiring Allied troops, but that the policy of benevolent neutrality\r\npromised would be maintained with all its consequences.  They disavowed\r\nany wish or intention to compel the Hellenic Government to {83}\r\nparticipate in the European War from which it had declared that it\r\nmeant to hold aloof.  But it was a vital necessity for them not to let\r\nit in any way hinder the freedom of their movements on land or sea, or\r\ncompromise the security of their troops throughout the field of their\r\noperations.  They therefore must be assured that they will obtain,\r\naccording to the promise already given by M. Zaimis, all the facilities\r\nwhich they might require, notably in the port of Salonica and on the\r\nroads and railways.  It was understood that the Entente Powers would\r\nrestore in full at the end of the War all the parts of Greek territory\r\nwhich they might be obliged to occupy during the hostilities, and that\r\nthey would duly pay indemnities for all damage caused by the\r\noccupation.[14]\r\n\r\nM. Skouloudis, after thanking the Entente Powers for the benevolent\r\nintentions with which they declared themselves to be animated towards\r\nGreece, willingly repeated the assurances he had so many times already\r\ngiven, that the Greek troops would in no circumstances seek to disarm\r\nor intern the Allied troops, and that the Greek Government in its\r\nrelations with the Entente Powers would in everything hold fast to its\r\npolicy of benevolent neutrality.  He once more noted the reiterated\r\ndisavowal by the Allied Governments of any wish or intention to force\r\nGreece into the War, and on his part disavowed any wish or intention to\r\nhinder in any way the freedom of their movements on land or sea, or to\r\ncompromise in any way the security of their troops.  The Hellenic\r\nGovernment had always kept the promises made by M. Zaimis to the very\r\nutmost of its ability, and had no difficulty in renewing the assurance\r\nthat the Allied Governments would continue to receive all the\r\nfacilities their troops might require in the port of Salonica, and on\r\nthe roads and railways.[15]\r\n\r\nThese prefatory amenities led on 10 December to a detailed Agreement,\r\nthe Greek Government promising to move its troops out of the way and\r\n\"not to oppose by force the construction of defensive works or the\r\noccupation of fortified points,\" but reserving to itself the right to\r\nprotest {84} against such operations \"energetically and seriously, not\r\nas a mere form\"--a right which the Allies easily conceded[16]--and\r\nemphatically declaring that \"should the Allied troops by their\r\nmovements bring the war into Greek territory, the Greek troops would\r\nwithdraw so as to leave the field free to the two parties to settle\r\ntheir differences.\"\r\n\r\nThe Entente Ministers expressed their satisfaction, and M. Skouloudis\r\nexpressed the hope that their Governments, convinced at last of the\r\nGreek Government's sincerity, would not only drop coercion, but comply\r\nwith its request for financial and commercial facilities.  They\r\npromised that all difficulties would disappear as soon as the military\r\nauthorities on the spot had given effect to the agreement; and the\r\nFrench Minister repeated his Government's declaration that it would be\r\nhappy to accord Greece all financial and commercial facilities as soon\r\nas the situation cleared.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Journal Officiel_, pp. 61, 70, 75-8.\r\n\r\n[2] Sir George Arthur's _Life of Lord Kitchener_.

Of all diplomatic fictions\r\nthat of \"benevolence\" is perhaps the most incompatible with the grim\r\nrealities of war.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sarrail had from the outset been empowered to take any measures\r\nwhich he might judge necessary at his discretion.  But fear of the\r\nGreek army for a time compelled him to temper vigour with caution.\r\nThat fear decreased in proportion as the Allied contingents in\r\nMacedonia increased; and hence a series of acts which show how the\r\nGeneral used his discretion.\r\n\r\nFirst, he judged it necessary to blow up the bridge of Demir-Hissar.\r\nHe blew it up--thus completely cutting off the Greek forces in Eastern\r\nMacedonia, and, incidentally, letting the enemy know that no offensive\r\nacross the Struma was contemplated by the Allies.  Next, he judged it\r\nnecessary to seize the Fort of Kara-Burnu which commands the entrance\r\nto Salonica Harbour.  He seized it--despite a solemn engagement to the\r\ncontrary.[1]  Then he judged it necessary to occupy the town of\r\nFlorina.  He occupied it.  An appreciation of the efficacy or\r\nexpediency of these measures--beyond a passing allusion to the obvious\r\nblunder committed by the destruction of the Demir-Hissar bridge--would\r\nbe out of place here.  For our present purpose their interest lies in\r\nthe light they throw upon the conditions, apart from the purely\r\nmilitary difficulties, created by the intrusion of foreign troops on\r\nneutral soil.\r\n\r\nAfloat the Allies were not less vigorous than ashore.  They judged it\r\nnecessary to occupy Corfu, in order to accommodate the remnants of the\r\nServian army that had escaped across Albania.  They occupied Corfu.\r\nThey judged it necessary to occupy Castellorizo, an islet off the coast\r\nof Asia Minor.  They occupied Castellorizo.  They {86} judged it\r\nnecessary to occupy Suda Bay in Crete and Argostoli Bay in Cephalonia.\r\nThey occupied them.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the occupation of Castellorizo was prepared\r\nby a local revolt stirred up by the French Consular and Naval\r\nauthorities,[2] and that the occupation of Corfu constituted a flagrant\r\nviolation of international pacts (Treaties of London, 14 Nov., 1863,\r\nand 29 March, 1864) to which the Entente Powers were signatories, and\r\nby virtue of which the perpetual neutrality of the island was\r\nguaranteed as strictly as that of Belgium--a circumstance that afforded\r\nthe Central Powers an opportunity to protest against Anglo-French\r\ncontempt for the sanctity of treaties.[3]\r\n\r\nAmong other arbitrary proceedings may be mentioned numerous arrests and\r\ndeportations of enemy subjects and Consuls, and even the execution of\r\nsome Greek subjects, by the Allied military and naval authorities.[4]\r\n\r\nAgainst each of these encroachments upon its sovereignty the Greek\r\nGovernment protested with ever-deepening bitterness.  The Entente\r\nGovernments accepted its protests and disregarded them: International\r\nLaw is the will of the stronger.  Besides, says M. Briand, \"we were\r\nthere in a country where force is more effective than anywhere else.\"\r\n[5]  From this utterance, which was received by the French Chamber with\r\napplause, we get a glimpse into the workings of the official Entente\r\nmind, and more than a glimpse of the guiding principles of Entente\r\npolicy in Greece during that period.\r\n\r\nThe reason for that policy publicly alleged was, as we have seen, the\r\nAllies' need to do their own fighting in {87} peace and security.\r\nTheir real aim, M. Skouloudis believed, was to draw Greece gradually\r\ninto the War.  In so believing he interpreted correctly the French\r\nGovernment's views as the French Government itself had expounded them\r\nto the British Government: \"To bring Greece in.\" [6]  With that as one\r\nof its objects the Salonica expedition had been persisted in; and as\r\nGreece persisted in standing out, the question resolved itself into one\r\nof continuous pressure.\r\n\r\nM. Skouloudis was confirmed in his belief by the fact that the Allies\r\nwould not allow demobilization, and at the same time would not lend\r\nGreece the 150 million francs which had been promised: they knew,\r\nthrough the International Financial Commission, that the mobilized army\r\nswallowed up every available resource, and they calculated that, when\r\nthe strain reached the breaking point, Greece would fall at their feet\r\nand beg for relief at any price: the Ministry would have either to give\r\nway or make place for one which favoured war.  The Ministry, determined\r\nto do neither, cast about for some means of making ends meet, when\r\nGermany came forward with an offer to lend temporarily a portion of the\r\nsum promised by France.  This offer, though, of course, prompted by the\r\ndesire to enable Greece to maintain her neutrality, was free from any\r\npolitical conditions, and M. Skouloudis accepted it thankfully.\r\nNegotiations began on 20 November, 1915, and by 7 March, 1916, an\r\ninstalment of 40 million francs was actually paid.  For obvious reasons\r\nthe transaction was carried through without the knowledge of the\r\nAllies, from whom the Greek Premier still cherished some faint hopes of\r\nreceiving the 150 millions.[7]\r\n\r\nWhether he had any right to cherish such hopes, after accepting\r\nfinancial assistance from their enemies, is a very nice ethical point;\r\nbut a nicer point still is, whether the Allies had any right left to\r\nquestion the ethics of others.  M. Skouloudis doubtless could plead in\r\nself-justification that his remaining armed was admittedly a boon to\r\nthem, as much as his remaining neutral was a boon to their enemies; and\r\nthat both sides should therefore help to defray the cost.  He was\r\nimpartial.  However, his hopes were dashed to the ground.\r\n\r\n{88}\r\n\r\nOn 5 April the French and British Ministers called on the Premier and\r\ninformed him that the Servian army at Corfu, having sufficiently rested\r\nand recovered, the Entente proposed to transport it to Salonica through\r\nGreece, and they had no doubt that Greece would readily consent.  M.\r\nSkouloudis replied that Greece could not possibly consent.  The\r\ntransport of over 100,000 men across the country would mean\r\ninterruption of railway traffic and suspension of all economic life for\r\nat least two months; it would expose the population to the danger of\r\ninfection by the epidemic diseases from which the Serbs had been\r\nsuffering; above all, it would be regarded by the Central Powers as a\r\nbreach of neutrality and might force Greece into the War against her\r\nwill.  M. Skouloudis urged these reasons with all the firmness, and\r\nmore than all the plainness, that diplomacy allowed, ending up with an\r\nemphatic: \"No, gentlemen, such a thing we will not permit.  I declare\r\nthis to you officially.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our Governments,\" retorted the French Minister, \"have not instructed\r\nus to ask for your permission, but to notify to you their decision.\"\r\n\r\nM. Skouloudis was a proud old man, fiercely jealous of his country's\r\nindependence and inflexible in his defence of it.  Of his iron\r\ndetermination he had already given the Allies ample proof.  But\r\nhitherto he had kept his gathering indignation under control.  He could\r\ndo so no longer: the Frenchman's speech and, more than the speech, the\r\nmanner in which it had been delivered, were too much for his feelings.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" he repeated, \"declare to you that my Government's decision is\r\nnot to permit this overland passage--further, I declare to you that, in\r\nthe contrary event, I shall find myself under the necessity of blowing\r\nup the railway,\"--then, in a crescendo of rage, he went on: \"You have\r\nleft us nothing sound in this country--neither self-respect, nor\r\ndignity, nor liberty, nor the right to live as free men.  But do not\r\nforget that there is a limit to the most benevolent patience and to the\r\nmost willing compliance, that one last drop makes the cup\r\noverflow. . . .\"\r\n\r\nThe British Minister, seeing that the conversation with his colleague\r\ngrew every moment more tempestuous, interposed by asking if Greece\r\nwould equally object to a {89} sea-passage of the Serbs by the Canal of\r\nCorinth; and, the Cabinet having been consulted, a favourable answer\r\nwas given.  But meanwhile the demand for an overland passage was\r\npressed by the Servian Minister, and was supported by all the Entente\r\nrepresentatives.  Again M. Skouloudis gave a categorical refusal, and\r\nin a telegraphic circular to the Greek Ministers in London, Rome, and\r\nPetrograd--experience had taught him that it was worse than useless to\r\nargue with Paris--he reiterated the reasons why Greece could not\r\nconsent, laying special stress on the now inflamed state of public\r\nopinion, and pointing out that the dangers of the sea route were\r\ngreatly exaggerated since most of the journey would be through close\r\nwaters.  He added that, in view of the absence of any real military\r\nnecessity for an overland transport, and of the international\r\nconsequences which compliance involved, the whole civilized world would\r\njustify Greece in her refusal and condemn any coercion on the part of\r\nthe Entente as an outrage.  He concluded by requesting the Greek\r\nMinisters to place all these reasons before the respective Governments\r\nin order that, on realizing the iniquity of the project, they might use\r\nall their influence to dissuade the French Government from it.  England\r\nappreciated the force of M. Skouloudis's arguments and, thanks to her,\r\ndiplomatic pressure ceased.  But there remained another form of\r\npressure, from which France would not desist.\r\n\r\nM. Briand angrily declared that, under the circumstances, there could\r\nbe no talk of a loan.  M. Skouloudis pleaded that Greece had not asked\r\nthe loan as a price for the violation of her neutrality; she had asked\r\nit on the supposition that the Entente Powers could not see with\r\nindifference her military and economic paralysis.[8]\r\n\r\nThe plea made no impression; and, rebuffed by Paris, M. Skouloudis's\r\nGovernment once more turned to Berlin.  It received another credit of\r\nforty million marks; but, notwithstanding this supply, day by day it\r\nsaw its expenses increasing and its revenues diminishing.  Besides the\r\nmen under arms, there were crowds of destitute refugees from Turkey,\r\nBulgaria and Servia to be provided for, and the native population,\r\nowing to the rise in the cost of living {90} and to unemployment, also\r\nstood in urgent need of relief.  At the same time, customs and other\r\nreceipts became more and more precarious owing to the Allies' constant\r\ninterference with the freedom of commerce.[9]\r\n\r\nTruly, after the Allies' landing on her soil, the neutrality of Greece\r\nbecame something unique in the annals of international jurisprudence: a\r\ncase defying all known maxims, except Machiavelli's maxim, that, when\r\nplaced between two warring powers, it is better for a state to join\r\neven the losing side than try to remain neutral.  By trying to do so,\r\nGreece could not avoid, even with the utmost circumspection, exposing\r\nherself to insult and injury.\r\n\r\nOne more corollary of the Salonica Expedition deserves to be noted.\r\nSince the beginning of the War, Athens, like other neutral capitals,\r\nhad become the centre of international intrigue and espionage; each\r\nbelligerent group establishing, beside their officially accredited\r\ndiplomatic missions, secret services and propagandas.  In aim, both\r\nestablishments were alike.  But their opportunities were not equal.\r\nThe Germans had to rely for procuring information and influencing\r\npublic opinion on the usual methods.  The French and the British added\r\nto those methods others of a more unusual character.\r\n\r\nFrom the riffraff of the Levant they had recruited a large detective\r\nforce which operated under the sanctuary of their Legations.[10]  The\r\nprimary function of these gentry was to discover attempts at the\r\nfuelling and victualling of German submarines; and, stimulated by a\r\npermanent offer of a reward of 2,000 pounds from the British Minister,\r\nthey did their best to discharge this necessary function.  Hardly a day\r\npassed without their supplying information which, transmitted to the\r\nFleets, led to raids at all points of the Greek coasts and isles.  Let\r\none or two examples suffice for many.\r\n\r\n{91}\r\n\r\nThe French Intelligence Service reported that the Achilleion--the\r\nKaiser's summer palace at Corfu--was a thoroughly organized submarine\r\nbase, with a wharf, stores of petrol, and pipes for carrying it down to\r\nthe water's edge.  On investigation, the wharf turned out to be an\r\nordinary landing stage for the palace, the stores a few tins of petrol\r\nfor the imperial motor cars, and the pipes water-closet drains.[11]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of similar \"information received from a trustworthy\r\nsource\"--that a Greek steamer had by order of the Greek Government\r\ntransported to Gerakini and handed over to the Custom House authorities\r\nfor the use of German submarines a quantity of benzine--a French\r\ndetachment of marines landed, forced its way into the Custom House, and\r\nproceeded to a minute perquisition, even digging up the ground.  The\r\nresult was negative, and the officer commanding the detachment had to\r\napologize to the Chief of the Custom House.  Whereupon the Greek\r\nGovernment asked the French Minister for the source of the information,\r\nadding that it was time the Allies ceased from putting faith in the\r\nwords of unscrupulous agents and proceeding to acts both fruitless and\r\ninsulting.[12]\r\n\r\nWere the Allies in the mood to use ordinary intelligence, they would\r\nhave seen the truth themselves; for not one discovery, after the most\r\nrigorous search, was ever made anywhere to confirm the reports of the\r\nSecret Services.[13]  As it was, the spies were able to justify their\r\nexistence by continuing to create work for their employers; and the\r\n{92} lengths to which they were prepared to go are well illustrated by\r\na case that formed the subject of some questions in the House of\r\nCommons.  M. Callimassiotis, a well-known Greek Deputy, was denounced\r\nby the French Secret Service as directing an organization for the\r\nsupply of fuel and information about the movements of Allied shipping\r\nto German submarines.  A burglarious visit to his house at the Piraeus\r\nyielded a rich harvest of compromising documents.  The British Secret\r\nService joined in following up the clues, and two Mohammedan merchants\r\nof Canea were arrested and deported to Malta on unimpeachable evidence\r\nof complicity.  Closer investigation proved the whole affair from\r\nbeginning to end a web of forgery and fraud.  The hoax ended in the\r\nBritish Minister at Athens apologizing to the Greek Deputy, and in the\r\nMohammedan merchants being brought back home as guests aboard a British\r\ndestroyer.[14]\r\n\r\nThus a new field was opened up to those who wished to ruin business\r\ncompetitors, to revenge themselves on personal enemies, or, above all,\r\nto compromise political opponents.  From the words of Admiral Dartige:\r\n\"The revelations of the Venizelist Press concerning the revictualling\r\nof German submarines in Greece are a tissue of absurd legends,\" [15] we\r\nlearn the main source of these myths and also the principal motive.\r\nFor if M. Venizelos and his party had, by their voluntary abstention,\r\ndeprived themselves of a voice inside the Chamber, they more than made\r\namends by their agitation out of doors.  The coercion of Greece came as\r\ngrist to their mill.  The Liberal newspapers triumphantly pointed to it\r\nas concrete proof of the wisdom of their Leader's policy, and held up\r\nthe names of the men who had thwarted him to obloquy and scorn.  M.\r\nSkouloudis and his colleagues were abused for drawing down upon the\r\ncountry through their duplicity the wrath of the Powers which could\r\nbest help or harm it.  The \"revelations\" served a twofold purpose: to\r\nfoster the belief that they promoted secretly the interests of Germany,\r\nand to furnish the Allies with fresh excuses for coercion.  And in the\r\nFranco-British Intelligence organization the scheming brain of M.\r\nVenizelos found a {93} ready-fashioned tool: men willingly shut their\r\neyes to the most evident truths that hinder their designs, and readily\r\naccept any myth that furthers them.\r\n\r\nNor did that organization assist M. Venizelos merely by traducing his\r\nopponents' characters and wounding their _amour-propre_.  In March,\r\n1916, the Chief of the French Secret Service, at a conference of the\r\nAllied admirals, proposed that they should lay hands on the internal\r\naffairs of Greece: that they should stick at nothing--_qu' on devait\r\ntout oser_.  The motion was rejected with disgust by the honest\r\nsailors.  But the mover was in direct communication with political\r\nheadquarters in Paris; and his plan was only deferred.  Meanwhile he\r\nand his associates with the rogues in their pay made themselves useful\r\nby collaborating in the Venizelist agitation, mixing themselves up in\r\nparty disturbances, carrying out open perquisitions and clandestine\r\narrests, and preparing the ground for graver troubles in the future.[16]\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the Entente at Athens pursued these unedifying\r\ntactics in the firm conviction that the cause of M. Venizelos was their\r\ncause; which was true enough in the sense that on him alone they could\r\ncount to bring Greece into the War without conditions.  As to the\r\nEntente publics, M. Venizelos was their man in a less sober sense: he\r\nkept repeating to them that his opponents under the guise of neutrality\r\nfollowed a hostile policy, and that his own party's whole activity was\r\ndirected to preventing the King from ranging himself openly on the side\r\nof the Central Powers.  The Entente Governments, whatever they may have\r\nthought of these tactics and slanders, did not dream of forbidding the\r\none or of contradicting the other, since the former aided their client\r\nand the latter created an atmosphere which relieved them from all moral\r\nrestraints.\r\n\r\nThey only upbraided M. Venizelos gently for keeping out of Parliament.\r\nSo M. Venizelos, seeing that he had gained nothing by abstention and\r\nforgetting that he had {94} pronounced the Chamber unconstitutional,\r\nobeyed.  Early in May, two of his partisans carried two bye-elections\r\nin Eastern Macedonia, and the leader himself was returned by the island\r\nof Mytilene.  Three seats in Parliament could not overturn M.\r\nSkouloudis; and it cannot be said that his re-appearance on the scene\r\nenhanced the credit of M. Venizelos with the nation.  Ever since the\r\nlanding of the Allies, and largely through their own actions, his\r\nprestige in Greece declined progressively.  He was reproached more and\r\nmore bitterly for his \"invitation\" to them; and these reproaches grew\r\nthe louder, the closer he drew to the foreigners and the farther he\r\ndiverged from his own King.  In a letter from Athens, dated 24 May,\r\noccurs the following passage: \"Venizelos becomes every day more and\r\nmore of a red republican.  How that man has duped everybody!  We all\r\nthought him a genius, and he simply is an ambitious maniac.\"\r\n\r\nLater on M. Venizelos explained why he had not already revolted.  A\r\nrevolution there and then, no doubt, would have saved a lot of trouble;\r\n\"But before the idea of revolution matures in the mind and soul of a\r\nstatesman, there is need for some evolution, which cannot be\r\naccomplished in a few moments,\" he said.  Since October, this idea had\r\nhad time to evolve in his mind and soul.  But his hate of \"tyranny\" was\r\nnot blind.  It was peculiarly clear-sighted, and he judged the\r\ndifficulties with precision: \"Such a step would not have been favoured\r\nby the Entente Powers, whose support would have been indispensable for\r\nits success.\"  Then again: \"If before the Bulgarian invasion of\r\nMacedonia I had kindled a civil war, public opinion would have held me\r\nresponsible for the invasion, and that would certainly have arrested my\r\nmovement.\" [17]\r\n\r\nIt so chanced that, scarcely had a fortnight passed since his\r\nreappearance in the Chamber, when the Bulgars provided M. Venizelos and\r\nat least one of the Entente Powers with this requisite for their\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See the Agreement of 10 Dec., 1915 (Art. 5), _White Book_, No. 54;\r\nSarrail, pp. 94-6, 322-30.\r\n\r\n[2] Skouloudis to Greek Legation, Paris, 12, 14, 16 Dec.

Venizelos taunted M. Skouloudis with forgetting that he had\r\npromised the Allies \"not only simple neutrality, nor simply benevolent\r\nneutrality, but most sincerely benevolent neutrality,\" the aged Prime\r\nMinister, who apparently had a sense of humour, replied: \"I do not know\r\nhow there can be such a thing as benevolent neutrality.  A neutrality\r\nreally benevolent towards one of the belligerents is really malevolent\r\ntowards the other, consequently it is more or less undisguised\r\npartiality.  Between benevolence and malevolence there is no room for\r\nneutrality.\"  He only knew, he said, one kind of neutrality--the\r\nabsolute neutrality towards both belligerents.[1]  And he lived up to\r\nhis knowledge so conscientiously that he earned the gratitude of\r\nneither, but saw himself the sport of both.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Allies begun to fall back from Krivolak, than the\r\nGerman Military Attaché at Athens presented to King Constantine a\r\ntelegram from General von Falkenhayn, dated 29 November, 1915, in which\r\nthe Chief of the German General Staff intimated that, if Greece failed\r\nto disarm the retreating Entente forces or to obtain their immediate\r\nre-embarkation, the development of hostilities might very probably\r\ncompel the Germans and the Bulgars to cross her frontiers.  After a\r\nconsultation, the Skouloudis Cabinet replied through the King that\r\nGreece did not consent to a violation of her soil; but if the violation\r\nbore no hostile character towards herself, she would refrain from\r\nopposing it by force of arms on certain guarantees: that the Bulgars\r\nshould categorically renounce every claim to territories now in Greek\r\npossession, that simultaneously with their entry into Macedonia Greece\r\nshould be allowed to occupy Monastir as a pledge for their exit, that\r\nin no circumstance whatever should the King of Bulgaria or his sons\r\nenter Salonica, {96} that all commands should be exclusively in German\r\nhands, and so forth--altogether nineteen conditions, the principal\r\nobject of which was to ward off the danger of a permanent occupation,\r\nbut the effect of which would have been to hamper military operations\r\nmost seriously.\r\n\r\nThe German Government, perturbed by the extent and nature of the\r\nguarantees demanded, referred the matter to Falkenhayn, who would only\r\ngrant three comprehensive assurances: to respect the integrity of\r\nGreece, to restore the occupied territories at the end of the campaign,\r\nand to pay an indemnity for all damage caused.  On those terms, he\r\ninvited Greece to remove her army from Macedonia so as to avoid the\r\npossibility of an accidental collision.  The King refused, giving among\r\nother reasons that such a concession had been denied to the Entente.\r\nThereupon Falkenhayn asked, as an alternative to a total evacuation,\r\nthat Greece should pledge herself to resist Entente landings in the\r\nGulfs of Cavalla and Katerini.  Again Greece refused, on the ground\r\nthat this would involve the use of force against the Entente, whereas\r\nshe was determined not to abandon her neutrality as long as her\r\ninterests, in her own opinion, did not compel her so to do.[2]\r\n\r\nAfter this answer, given on 27 January, 1916, conversations on the\r\nsubject ceased for about six weeks.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that during the period when the Allies were, or\r\nprofessed to be, most nervous about the intentions of Greece, it was\r\nthe fear of Greek hostility, carefully nursed by Greek diplomacy, that\r\nchecked the Germans and the Bulgars from following up their advantage\r\nand sweeping the Franco-British troops into the sea.  It was the same\r\nattitude of Greece that made the enemy hesitate to break into Macedonia\r\nduring the following months, and gave the Allies time to fortify\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOn 14 March, Falkenhayn returned to the charge, and was once more met\r\nwith a list of exorbitant conditions.  This time the conversations\r\nassumed the character of recriminations; the Greek Government\r\ncomplaining of Bulgarian encroachments on the neutral zone fixed along\r\nthe frontier, Falkenhayn retorting that the provocative movements of\r\nthe Entente Forces obliged the Central Powers to fortify their\r\npositions and threatening a rupture {97} if the Greek soldiers\r\ncontinued to hinder the Bulgars.[3]  Then, after another interval, he\r\nannounced (7 May) that, owing to an English advance across the Struma,\r\nhe found it absolutely necessary to secure in self-defence the Rupel\r\nPass--key of the Struma Valley.[4]\r\n\r\nM. Skouloudis endeavoured to make the German Government dissuade the\r\nGeneral Staff from its project.  Falkenhayn, he said, was misinformed\r\nas to an English advance--only small mounted patrols had crossed the\r\nStruma.  He suspected that he was deceived and instigated by the\r\nBulgars who, under cover of military exigencies, sought to realize\r\ntheir well-known ambitions at the expense of Greece.  Their frequent\r\nmisdeeds had already irritated Greek public opinion to such a degree\r\nthat he could not answer for the consequences, should the project be\r\ncarried out.  The appearance of Bulgarian troops in Macedonia would\r\ncreate a national ferment of which Venizelos and the Entente Powers\r\nwould take advantage in order to overthrow the present Ministry and\r\nforce Greece into war.[5]\r\n\r\nImpressed by these arguments, the German Government did its utmost to\r\ninduce Falkenhayn to abandon his scheme; von Jagow even going so far as\r\nto draw up, with the assistance of the Greek Minister at Berlin, a\r\nremonstrance to the Chief of the General Staff.  But it was all to no\r\npurpose.  The political department had very little influence over the\r\nHigh Command.  Falkenhayn insisted on the accuracy of his information,\r\nand adhered to his own point of view.  He could not understand, he\r\nsaid, why a German move should cause any special excitement in Greece,\r\nseeing that it was directed against the French and the English, who\r\npaid no heed to Greek susceptibilities, and he irritably complained\r\nthat, while Greece allowed the Entente full liberty to improve its\r\nposition day by day, she raised the greatest obstacles to Germany's\r\nleast demand.[6]  In brief, from being more or less pliant, the Chief\r\nof the General Staff became rigid: he would no longer submit to rebuffs\r\nand denials.  Strategic reasons, perhaps, had brought about this\r\nchange; perhaps the Bulgars were the instigators.  It is impossible to\r\nsay, {98} and it does not much matter.  The essential fact is that the\r\nman had power and meant to use it.\r\n\r\nThere followed a formal communication from the German and Bulgarian\r\nMinisters at Athens to M. Skouloudis, stating that their troops were\r\ncompelled in self-defence to push into Greek territory, and assuring\r\nhim that neither the integrity and sovereignty of Greece nor the\r\npersons and property of the inhabitants would in any way suffer by this\r\ntemporary occupation.  M. Skouloudis took note of this decision without\r\nassenting to it, but also without protesting: he felt, he said, that a\r\npremature protest could only lose Greece the guarantees of restoration\r\nand reparation offered.  Sufficient unto the day the evil thereof:\r\nconfronted with powerful Empires in the height of their military\r\nstrength, he had done all that was humanly possible to ward off their\r\nadvance, and, though unsuccessful in the end, he had at least obtained\r\na solemn pledge of their ultimate retreat.  The protest came a few days\r\nlater, when the invasion actually took place.[7]\r\n\r\nOn 26 May, a Germano-Bulgarian force appeared at Rupel.  The garrison,\r\nin accordance with its instructions of 27 April (O.S.) to resist any\r\nadvance beyond 500 metres from the frontier line, fired upon the\r\ninvaders and drove them back.  But on fresh orders reaching it to\r\nfollow the instructions of 9 March (O.S.)--which prescribed that, in\r\nthe event of a foreign invasion, the Greek troops should withdraw--it\r\nsurrendered the fort.[8]\r\n\r\nIn Entente circles it had long been assumed that, let the King and his\r\nGovernment do what they liked, the instant a Bulgarian foot stepped\r\nover the border, soldiers and civilians would fly to arms.  Nothing of\r\nthe sort happened.  However painful to their feelings their orders\r\nmight be, the soldiers obeyed them.  Among the civilians also the\r\nshock, severe as it was, produced no demoralization.  The Greek people\r\ngenerally understood that the surrender of Rupel was an inevitable\r\nconsequence of the landing at Salonica.  Nevertheless, the fears of M.\r\nSkouloudis that {99} a Bulgarian invasion would place a powerful weapon\r\nin the hands of his opponents were abundantly fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBy representing the event as the result of a treacherous collusion\r\nbetween Athens and the Central Powers,[9] M. Venizelos roused the\r\nAllied nations to fury.  Their Governments, of course, knew better.\r\nEven in France official persons recognized that the occupation of Rupel\r\nwas a defensive operation which Greece could not oppose by force.  Yet\r\nthey had hoped that she would have averted it by diplomatic action.  As\r\nit was, they concluded that she must have received from the Central\r\nPowers very strong assurances that the occupied territories would be\r\nrestored to her.  In any case, they said, the Skouloudis Cabinet's\r\npassivity in face of a move calculated to prejudice the Allies'\r\nmilitary position contradicted its oft-repeated protestations of a\r\nbenevolent neutrality towards them.[10]\r\n\r\nM. Skouloudis hastened to vindicate his conduct.  He did not tell the\r\nEntente Powers, as he might have done, that he had by diplomatic action\r\nput off an invasion for six months, and thus enabled them to increase\r\ntheir forces and consolidate their position.  Neither did he tell them\r\nanother thing which in itself formed an ample refutation of the charge\r\nof collusion--that on 27 April (10 May) General Sarrail had occupied\r\nthe frontier fort Dova-tépé with the tacit consent of the Hellenic\r\nGovernment, which had deliberately excluded that fort from the\r\ninstructions of resistance issued that day to its troops, and that\r\nGreek officers urged him at the same time to occupy Rupel, dwelling on\r\nthe military importance of the fort for the defence of Eastern\r\nMacedonia; an advice which the French General had ignored on the ground\r\nthat Rupel lay altogether outside the Allies' zone of action, and he\r\ncould not spare the troops necessary for its occupation.[11]\r\n\r\n{100}\r\n\r\nThe Greek Premier simply said that his Government's passivity was in\r\nstrict accord with the explicit declarations of its policy and\r\nintentions, enunciated at the very outset, ratified by the Agreement of\r\n10 December, 1915, and reiterated _ad nauseam_ to the Entente\r\nMinisters--viz., that \"should the Allied troops by their movements\r\nbring the war into Greek territory, the Greek troops would withdraw so\r\nas to leave the field free to the two parties to settle their\r\ndifferences.\"  Far from changing his attitude, he once more, in reply\r\nto M. Briand's threat that, \"if the Bulgarian advance continued without\r\nresistance there might ensue the most serious consequences for the\r\nHellenic Government,\" emphatically declared: \"Resistance is only\r\npossible if we abandon our neutrality, and the demand that we should\r\nresist is therefore in flagrant contradiction to the oft-repeated\r\nprotestations of the Entente Powers that they have neither the wish nor\r\nthe intention to force us into the War.\"  Nor could he understand how\r\nthey could think of blaming Greece for receiving from the Central\r\nPowers the same assurances of eventual restoration as those given by\r\nthemselves.[11]\r\n\r\nM. Skouloudis spoke in vain.  Paris had made up its mind to treat the\r\nincident as indicating a new and malevolent orientation against which\r\nit behoved the Allies to protect themselves.  Accordingly, on 1 June,\r\nM. Briand authorized General Sarrail to proclaim a state of siege at\r\nSalonica.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sarrail, who had long sought to be freed from the trammels of\r\nGreek sovereignty--\"_et à être maître chez moi_\"--but had hitherto been\r\ndenied his wish by the British Government, jumped at the permission,\r\nand he improved upon it with a personal touch, trivial yet\r\ncharacteristic.  So far back as 27 April he had recommended that \"we\r\nmust strike at the head, attack frankly and squarely the one enemy--the\r\nKing.\"  Pending an opportunity to strike, he seized the occasion to\r\nslight.  He fixed the proclamation for 3 June, King Constantine's name\r\nday, which was to be celebrated at Salonica as in every other town of\r\nthe kingdom with a solemn _Te Deum_.  {101} The British General, Milne,\r\nwho had arranged to assist at the _Te Deum_, after vainly trying to\r\nobtain at least a postponement of the date out of respect for the King,\r\nfound himself obliged to yield.  And so on that festal morning martial\r\nlaw was proclaimed.  Allied detachments with machine guns occupied\r\nvarious strategic points, the public offices were taken possession of,\r\nthe chiefs of the Macedonian gendarmerie and police were expelled, and\r\nthe local press was placed under a French censor.  All this, without\r\nany preliminary notification to the Hellenic Government, which\r\nexpressed its indignation that a French General, forgetting the most\r\nelementary rules of courtesy and hospitality, thought fit to choose\r\nsuch a moment for inaugurating a state of things that formed at once a\r\ngratuitous affront to the sovereign of the country and a breach of the\r\nterms of the Agreement of 10 December.[13]\r\n\r\nBut this was only a prelude, followed on 6 June by a blockade of the\r\nGreek coasts, established in pursuance of orders from Paris and\r\nLondon--_pourpeser sur la Grèce et lui montrer qu'elle était à notre\r\nmerci_.[14]  Even this measure, however, did not seem to M. Briand\r\nsufficient.  He advocated intervention of a nature calculated to disarm\r\nour enemies and to encourage our friends.  His views did not meet with\r\napproval in London: Sir Edward Grey had \"_des scrupules honorables_,\"\r\nwhich M. Briand set himself to overcome by pen and tongue.  The Entente\r\nPowers, he argued, were protectors of Greece--guarantors of her\r\nexternal independence and internal liberty.  The Greek Government was\r\nbound to defend its territories with them against all invaders, and it\r\nhad broken that obligation.  Further, it had sinned by violating the\r\nConstitution.  On both counts the Entente Powers had not only the right\r\nbut the duty to intervene.  Thus only could they justify, in the eyes\r\nof the Greek people, the blockade by which the whole population\r\nsuffered, and which it would otherwise not understand.  There was no\r\ntime to lose: the dignity of France demanded swift and drastic action:\r\nthe Athenians had gone so far as to ridicule in a cinema the {102}\r\nuniform of the heroes of Verdun.  If England would not join her, she\r\nmust act alone.[15]\r\n\r\nThese arguments--particularly, one may surmise, the last--overcame Sir\r\nEdward Grey's honourable scruples; and on 16 June a squadron was\r\nordered to be ready to bombard Athens, while a brigade was embarked at\r\nSalonica for the same destination.  Before the guns opened fire,\r\nhydroplanes would drop bombs on the royal palace; then the troops would\r\nland, occupy the town, and proceed to arrest, among others, the royal\r\nfamily.  Such were the plans elaborated under the direction of the\r\nFrench Minister at Athens, much to the joy of General Sarrail, who had\r\nsaid and written again and again that \"nothing could be done unless the\r\nKing was put down.\" [16]\r\n\r\nAll arrangements for this \"demonstration\" completed, on 21 June the\r\nEntente Powers, \"ever animated by the most benevolent and amicable\r\nspirit towards Greece\"--it is wonderful to what acts these words often\r\nform the accompaniment--had the honour to deliver to her Government a\r\nNote by which they demanded:\r\n\r\n1. The immediate and total demobilization of the Army.\r\n\r\n2. The immediate replacement of the present Cabinet by a business\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n3. The immediate dissolution of the Chamber and fresh elections.\r\n\r\n4. The discharge of police officers obnoxious to them.\r\n\r\nThey admitted neither discussion nor delay, but left to the Hellenic\r\nGovernment the entire responsibility for the events that would ensue if\r\ntheir just demands were not complied with at once.\r\n\r\nAs M. Briand had anticipated, the sight of our warships' smoke\r\nquickened the Greek Government's sense of justice.  King Constantine\r\npromptly complied, the \"demonstration,\" to the intense disappointment\r\nof M. Guillemin and General Sarrail, was adjourned, and a Ministry of a\r\nnon-political character, under the leadership of M. Zaimis, was\r\nappointed to carry on the administration of the country until the\r\nelection of a new Chamber.[17]\r\n\r\nThe event marked a new phase in the relations between {103} Greece and\r\nthe Entente Powers.  Henceforth they appear not as trespassers on\r\nneutral territory, but as protectors installed there, according to M.\r\nBriand, by right--a right derived from treaties and confirmed by\r\nprecedents.[18]  Concerning the treaties all comment must be postponed\r\ntill the question comes up in a final form.  But as to the precedents,\r\nit may be observed that the most pertinent and helpful of all was one\r\nwhich M. Briand did not cite.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Crimean War, Greece, under King Otho, wanted to\r\nfight Turkey, and realize some of her national aspirations with the\r\nassistance of Russia.  But France and England, who were in alliance\r\nwith Turkey against Russia, would not allow such a thing.  Their\r\nMinisters at Athens told King Otho that strict neutrality was the only\r\npolicy consonant with the honour and the interest of Greece: while\r\nhostilities lasted her commerce, as a neutral nation, would flourish,\r\nand by earning their goodwill she could, at the conclusion of peace,\r\nhope not to be forgotten in the re-making of the map of Eastern Europe.\r\nFor refusing to listen to these admonitions King Otho was denounced as\r\na pro-Russian autocrat, and the Allies landed troops at the Piraeus to\r\ncompel obedience to their will.\r\n\r\nOnce more a Greek sovereign had drawn down upon himself the wrath of\r\nthe Protecting Powers, with the traditional charges of hostile\r\ntendencies in his foreign and autocratic tendencies in his domestic\r\nconduct, for daring to adopt an independent Greek policy.\r\n\r\nThis time the three Powers were united in a common cause, which\r\nnecessitated unity of action on all fronts.  But it would be an error\r\nto imagine that this unity of action rested everywhere upon a community\r\nof views or of ulterior aims.  Certainly such was not the case in\r\nGreece.  France had her own views and aims in that part of the world.\r\nM. Briand was bent on bringing Greece into the War, not because he\r\nthought her help could exercise a decisive influence over its course,\r\nbut because he wanted her to share in the spoils under French auspices:\r\nhe considered it France's interest to have in the Eastern Mediterranean\r\na strong Greece closely tied to her.[19]\r\n\r\n{104}\r\n\r\nThat programme France intended to carry through at all costs and by all\r\nmeans.  England and Russia, for the sake of the paramount object of the\r\nWar, acquiesced and co-operated.  But the acquiescence was compulsory\r\nand the co-operation reluctant.  The underlying disaccord between the\r\nthree Allies reflected itself in the demeanour of their representatives\r\nat Athens.\r\n\r\nM. Guillemin, the French Minister, stood before the Greek Government\r\nviolently belligerent.  Brute force, accentuated rather than concealed\r\nby a certain irritating finesse, seemed to be his one idea of\r\ndiplomacy, and he missed no conceivable opportunity for giving it\r\nexpression: so much so that after a time the King found it impossible\r\nto receive him.  Sir Francis Elliot, the British Minister, formed a\r\npleasing contrast to his French colleague: a scrupulous and courteous\r\ngentleman, he did not disguise his repugnance to a policy involving at\r\nevery step a fresh infringement of a neutral nation's rights.  As it\r\nwas, he endeavoured to moderate proceedings which he could neither\r\napprove nor prevent.  Prince Demidoff, a Russian diplomat of amiable\r\nmanners, seconded Sir Francis Elliot's counsels of moderation and\r\nyielded to M. Guillemin's clamours for coercion.[20]\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear this disaccord in mind in order to understand\r\nwhat went before and what comes hereafter: for, though for the most\r\npart latent, it was always present; and if it did not avert, it\r\nretarded the climax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Orations_, p. 155; Skouloudis's _Semeioseis_, p. 36.\r\n\r\n[2] _White Book_, Nos. 70-4, 79, 81, 84, 86-90.\r\n\r\n[3] _White Book_, Nos. 92, 93, 96-102.\r\n\r\n[4] _White Book_, No. 104.\r\n\r\n[5] _White Book_, Nos. 106, 111, 113.\r\n\r\n[6] _White Book_, Nos. 110, 112, 116.\r\n\r\n[7] _White Book_, Nos. 117-20, 134, 135; Skouloudis's _Apantesis_, pp.\r\n25-6.\r\n\r\n[8] _White Book_, Nos. 95, 105, 126, 130-33, 137.

One half of the preamble\r\nwas taken up by their grievances against the Skouloudis Government--its\r\ntoleration of foreign propagandists and its connivance at the entry of\r\nenemies, which formed a fresh menace for their armies.  The other half\r\nwas devoted to the violation of the Constitution by the dissolution of\r\ntwo Chambers within less than a year and the subjection of the country\r\nto a regime of tyranny.  Their aim, they said, was to safeguard the\r\nGreek people in the enjoyment of its rights and liberties.[1]\r\n\r\nThese generous sentiments left the Greek people strangely cold.\r\nIndeed, the absence of any manifestations of popular joy at the Allies'\r\nsuccess was as striking as had been the manifestations of resentment at\r\nthe means employed.  The only persons who did applaud the action were\r\nthe persons whose party interests it served.  The Venizelist Press\r\nhailed the triumph of violence as a victory for legality.  M. Venizelos\r\naddressed to M. Briand his felicitations, and gave public utterance to\r\nhis gratitude as follows: \"The Note solved a situation from which there\r\nwas no other issue.  The just severity of its tone, the sincerity of\r\nits motives, its expressly drawn distinction between the Greek people\r\nand the ex-Government, give it more than anything else a paternal\r\ncharacter towards the people of this country.  The Protecting Powers\r\nhave acted only like parents reclaiming a son's birthright.\" [2]\r\n\r\nPared down to realities, the aim of the Protecting Powers was to bring\r\ntheir protégé to power and Greece into the War.  The demobilization of\r\nthe army, which stood first on their list, was the first step to that\r\nend.  M. Venizelos {106} had been asserting that the people were still\r\nwith him, and, given a chance, would uphold his policy, but that chance\r\nwas denied them by the mobilization.  With a pardonable ignorance of\r\nthe people's feelings, and also, it must be owned, with a too naïve\r\nconfidence in the accuracy of the People's Chosen, the Allies had\r\ndecided to act on this assumption: an assumption on which M. Venizelos\r\nhimself was most reluctant to act.\r\n\r\nWe have it on his own evidence that he looked for a solution of his\r\ndifficulties, not to an election, but to a revolution.  Further, he has\r\ntold us that, eager as he might be for a revolutionary stroke, he could\r\nnot lose sight of the obstacles.  To those who held up French\r\nrevolutions as a model, he pointed out that the analogy was fallacious:\r\nin France \"long years of tyranny had exasperated the people to its very\r\ndepths.  In Greece the people had a king who, only two years earlier,\r\nhad headed his armies in two victorious campaigns.\" [3]  So he scouted\r\nthe idea of intervention at Athens, convinced that any attack on the\r\nCrown would spell destruction to himself.[4]  His project was to steal\r\nto Salonica and there, under General Sarrail's shield, to start a\r\nseparatist movement \"directed against the Bulgars, but not against the\r\nking,\" apparently hoping that the Greek troops in Macedonia, among whom\r\nhis apostles had been busy, fired by anti-Bulgar hate, would join him\r\nand drag king and country after them.  This project had been\r\ncommunicated by the French Minister at Athens to General Sarrail on 31\r\nMay:[5] but, as the British Government was not yet sufficiently\r\nadvanced to countenance sedition,[6] M. Venizelos and his French\r\nconfederate saw reason to abandon it for the present.\r\n\r\nThus all concerned were committed to a test of the real desires of the\r\nGreek people by a General Election, which they declared themselves\r\nanxious to bring off without delay--early in August.  This time there\r\nwould be no ambiguity about the issue: although the Allies in their\r\nNote, as was proper and politic, had again disclaimed any {107} wish or\r\nintention to make Greece depart from her neutrality, M. Venizelos\r\nproclaimed that he still adhered to his bellicose programme, and that\r\nhe was more confident of victory than ever[7]: had not the Reservists\r\nbeen set free to vote, and were not those ardent warriors his\r\nenthusiastic supporters?  With this cry--perhaps in this belief--he\r\nentered the arena.\r\n\r\nIt was a lively contest--rhetoric and corruption on both sides\r\nreinforced by terrorism, to which the Allies' military authorities in\r\nMacedonia, and their Secret Service at Athens, whose efficiency had\r\nbeen greatly increased by the dismissal of many policemen obnoxious to\r\nthem, and by other changes brought about through the Note of 21 June,\r\ncontributed of their best.\r\n\r\nBut even veteran politicians are liable to error.  The Reservists left\r\ntheir billets in Macedonia burning with anger and shame at the\r\nindignities and hardships which they had endured.  The Allies might\r\nhave had among those men as many friends as they pleased, and could\r\nhave no enemies unless they created them by treating them as such.  And\r\nthis is just what they did: from first to last, the spirit displayed by\r\nGeneral Sarrail towards the Greek army was a spirit of insulting\r\ndistrust and utterly unscrupulous callousness.\r\n\r\nUnable to revenge themselves on the foreign trespasser, the Reservists\r\nvowed to wreak their vengeance on his native abettor.  They travelled\r\nback to their villages shouting: \"A black vote for Venizelos!\" and\r\nimmediately formed leagues in the constituencies with a view to\r\ncombating his candidates.  The latter did all they could to exploit the\r\nnational hate for the Bulgars and the alarm caused by their invasion.\r\nBut fresh animosities had blunted the edge of old feelings: besides,\r\nhad not the Bulgarian invasion been provoked by the Allies' occupation,\r\nand who was responsible for that occupation?  For the rest, the\r\nquestion, as it presented itself to the masses, was no longer simply\r\none of neutrality or war.  Despite M. Venizelos's efforts, and thanks\r\nto the efforts of his adversaries, his breach with the King had become\r\npublic, and {108} the division of the nation had now attained to the\r\ndimensions of a schism--Royalists against Venizelists.  Nor could there\r\nbe any doubt as to the relative strength of the rival camps.\r\n\r\nThus, by a sort of irony, the action which was designed to clothe\r\nVenizelos with new power threatened to strip him of the last rags of\r\nprestige that still clung to his name.  Therefore, the elections\r\noriginally fixed for early in August were postponed by the Entente to\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nSuch was the internal situation, when external events brought the\r\nstruggle to a head.\r\n\r\nWith the accession of 120,000 Serbs, 23,000 Italians, and a Russian\r\nbrigade, the Allied army in Macedonia had reached a total of about\r\n350,000 men, of whom, owing to the summer heats and the Vardar marshes,\r\nsome 210,000 were down with malaria.[8]  Nevertheless, under pressure\r\nfrom home and against his own better judgment,[9] General Sarrail began\r\nan offensive (10 August).  As might have been foreseen, this display of\r\nenergy afforded the Bulgars an excuse, and the demobilization of the\r\nGreek forces an opportunity, for a fresh invasion.  M. Zaimis, in view\r\nof the contingency, imparted to General Sarrail his Government's\r\nintention to disarm the forts in Eastern Macedonia, so that he might\r\nforestall the Bulgars by occupying them.  But again, as in May, the\r\nFrenchman treated the friendly hint with scornful suspicion.[10]  There\r\nfollowed a formal notice from the German and Bulgarian Ministers at\r\nAthens to the Premier, stating that their troops were compelled, by\r\nmilitary exigencies, to push further into Greek territory, and\r\nrepeating the assurances given to his predecessor on the occupation of\r\nFort Rupel.[11]\r\n\r\nThe operation was conducted in a manner which belied these assurances.\r\nColonel Hatzopoulos, acting Commandant of the Fourth Army Corps,\r\nreported from his headquarters at Cavalla that the Bulgarian troops\r\nwere accompanied by irregular bands which indulged in murder {109} and\r\npillage; that the inhabitants of the Serres and Drama districts were\r\nfleeing panic-stricken; and that the object of the invaders clearly\r\nwas, after isolating the various Greek divisions, to occupy the whole\r\nof Eastern Macedonia.  He begged for permission to call up the\r\ndisbanded reservists, and for the immediate dispatch of the Greek\r\nFleet.  But the Athens Government vetoed all resistance, and the\r\ninvasion went on unopposed.[12]  By 24 August the Bulgars were on the\r\noutskirts of Cavalla.\r\n\r\nTruth to tell, the real authors of the invasion were the Allies and M.\r\nVenizelos, who, by forcing Greece to disarm before the assembled enemy,\r\npractically invited him.  But it was not to be expected that they\r\nshould see things in this light.  They, as usual, saw in them a new\r\n\"felony\"--yet another proof of King Constantine's desire to assist the\r\nKaiser and defeat M. Venizelos[13]--and acted accordingly.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos opened the proceedings with a meeting outside his house on\r\nSunday, 27 August, when he delivered from his balcony a direct\r\napostrophe to the King--an oration which may have lost some of its\r\ndramatic effect by being read out of a carefully prepared manuscript,\r\nbut which on that account possesses greater documentary value:\r\n\r\n\"Thou, O King, hast become the victim of conscienceless counsellors who\r\nhave tried to destroy the work accomplished by the Revolution of 1909,\r\nto bring back the previous maladministration, and to satisfy their\r\npassionate hate for the People's Chosen Leader.  Thou art the victim of\r\nmilitary advisers of limited perceptions and of oligarchic principles.\r\nThou hast become the victim of thy admiration for Germany, in whose\r\nvictory thou hast believed, hoping through that victory to elbow aside\r\nour {110} free Constitution and to centre in thy hands the whole\r\nauthority of the State.\"  After enumerating the disastrous results of\r\nthese errors--\"instead of expansion in Asia Minor, Thrace, and Cyprus,\r\na Bulgarian invasion in Macedonia and the loss of valuable war\r\nmaterial\"--the orator referred to the elections and warned the King\r\nthat persistence in his present attitude would involve danger to the\r\nthrone: \"The use of the august name of Your Majesty in the contest\r\nagainst the Liberal Party introduces the danger of an internal\r\nrevolution.\"  The discourse ended with another scarcely veiled menace\r\nto the King: \"If we are not listened to, then we shall take counsel as\r\nto what must be done to rescue all that can be rescued out of the\r\ncatastrophe which has overtaken us.\" [14]\r\n\r\nIt was not an empty threat.  The Chief spoke on Sunday, and on\r\nWednesday his followers at Salonica rose up in revolt and, supported by\r\nGeneral Sarrail, took possession of the public offices, set up a\r\nrevolutionary committee under a Cretan, and launched a war proclamation\r\nfor Macedonia on the side of the Entente.  The Royalist troops, after\r\nsome fighting, were besieged in their barracks, starved into surrender,\r\nand finally shipped off to the Piraeus, while many civil and\r\necclesiastical personages were thrown into prison.  The French General\r\nreceived notice that M. Venizelos himself would arrive on 9 September\r\nto take command of the movement.[15]\r\n\r\nConcurrently with this first product of the plot hatched between M.\r\nVenizelos and M. Guillemin in May, was carried on the more orthodox\r\nmode of action inaugurated by the Allied Governments in June.  At the\r\nnews of the Bulgarian invasion, the French Minister at Athens felt or\r\nfeigned unbounded fear--_tout était à redoubter_: even a raid by Uhlans\r\nto the very gates of the capital--and asked Paris for a squadron to be\r\nplaced at his disposal.  Paris did what it could.  On 26 August Admiral\r\nDartige du Fournet was ordered to form a special squadron and proceed\r\nagainst Athens according to the plans drawn up {111} in June.  He\r\nimmediately left Malta at the head of thirty-four ships, and on the\r\n28th arrived at Milo, where he found a British contingent of\r\nthirty-nine ships awaiting him.  The joint armada thus formed was\r\nbelieved to be strong enough to preclude all danger of resistance.  For\r\nall that, every precaution was taken to secure to it the advantage of a\r\nsurprise, though in vain: its size and the proximity of its objective\r\nrendered secrecy impossible.\r\n\r\nFour days were wasted in idleness--a delay due to England's scruples.\r\nBut at last all was ready; and on the morning of 1 September the Allied\r\nFleet stood out to sea: seventy-three units of every description, the\r\nbig ships in single file, flanked by torpedo-boats, steaming bravely at\r\nthe rate of fifteen knots, and leaving behind them a track of\r\nwhite-crested waves that stretched to the very edge of the horizon: _le\r\ncoup d'oeil est impressionant_.\r\n\r\nAll arrangements for battle had been made, and each contingent had its\r\nspecial role assigned to it: only the Intelligence Services, being\r\notherwise occupied, had failed to furnish any information about Greek\r\nmines and submarines.  It was therefore necessary to be more than ever\r\ncareful.  But the six hours' voyage was accomplished safely, and not\r\nuntil the armada cast anchor at the mouth of the Salamis Strait did it\r\nmeet with a tangible token of hostility.  The Greek Admiral commanding\r\nthe Royal Fleet before the arsenal of Salamis--a force composed of two\r\nironclads, one armoured cruiser, eighteen torpedo-boats and two\r\nsubmarines--failed to bid the Allies welcome: a breach of international\r\nrules which was duly resented and remedied.\r\n\r\nThe expedition had for its objects: (1) To seize a dozen enemy\r\nmerchantmen which had taken refuge since the beginning of the War in\r\nthe harbours of Eleusis and the Piraeus; (2) to obtain the control of\r\nGreek posts and telegraphs; (3) to procure the expulsion of enemy\r\npropagandists, and the prosecution of such Greek subjects as had\r\nrendered themselves guilty of complicity in corruption and espionage on\r\nthe wrong side.\r\n\r\nOf the first operation, which was conducted to a successful issue that\r\nsame evening \"with remarkable activity\" by one of Admiral Dartige's\r\nsubordinates, no justification was attempted: we needed tonnage and\r\ntook it.  The {112} pretext for the second was that the Allies had\r\nheard \"from a sure source\" that their enemies were furnished by the\r\nHellenic Government with military information.  So serious a charge, if\r\nmade in good faith, should have been supported by the clearest proofs.\r\nYet even Admiral Dartige, whose disagreeable duty it was to prefer it,\r\nbitterly complained that \"he never received from Paris a single proof\r\nwhich could enlighten him.\"  On the other hand, he did receive abundant\r\nenlightenment about the \"sure source\": the Russian Minister needed to\r\nsend a cipher message to the American Embassy at Constantinople which\r\nwas entrusted with Russian interests, and, the Hellenic Government\r\nreadily agreeing to transmit it through its Legation at Pera, Prince\r\nDemidoff, with the consent of his Entente colleagues, proceeded to make\r\nuse of the Athens wireless for that purpose.  Within forty-eight hours\r\nthe Admiral received from Paris an excited telegram asking him what\r\nmeasures he had taken to prevent the Hellenic Government from\r\n\"violating its engagements.\"  The rebuke, explains the Admiral, was the\r\nresult of a sensational report from the head of the French Secret\r\nIntelligence at Athens, denouncing the above transaction as an example\r\nof \"the bad faith of the Greeks.\"  On this pretext all the means by\r\nwhich the Hellenic Government could communicate with its\r\nrepresentatives abroad and reply to the attacks of its enemies passed\r\nunder the Allies' control.\r\n\r\nSomewhat less neat were the methods adopted to secure the third object\r\nof the expedition.  The Secret Services had compiled a voluminous\r\nregister of undesirable persons out of which they drew up a select list\r\nof candidates for expulsion and prosecution.  Unfortunately, despite\r\ntheir industry, it teemed with embarrassing errors: individuals put\r\ndown as Germans turned out to be Greeks; and the suspects of Greek\r\nnationality included high personages, such as M. Streit, ex-Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, General Dousmanis and Colonel Metaxas, ex-Chiefs\r\nof the General Staff, and so on.  At last an expurgated list was\r\napproved and carried out summarily.[16]  Some of the criminals escaped\r\npunishment by transferring their services from the German to the French\r\nand British propagandas; for, {113} while to intrigue with the former\r\nwas to commit a crime, to intrigue with the latter was to perform a\r\nmeritorious deed.\r\n\r\nThere the Allies and M. Venizelos stopped for the moment, hoping that\r\nRumania's entry into the War, which had just taken place, would induce\r\nGreece to do likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Journal Officiel_, p. 99.\r\n\r\n[2] The _Daily Mail_, 24 June, 1916.\r\n\r\n[3] _The New Europe_, 29 March, 1917.\r\n\r\n[4] Du Fournet, p. 91.\r\n\r\n[5] Sarrail, pp. 107, 354-5.\r\n\r\n[6] \"_L'Angleterre avait mis son veto._\"--Sarrail, p. 153.\r\n\r\n[7] See his statement to the Correspondent of the Paris _Journal_, in\r\nthe _Hesperia_, of London, 7 July, 1916.\r\n\r\n[8] Du Fournet, p. 99.\r\n\r\n[9] Caclamanos, Paris, 1/14 June, 1916.\r\n\r\n[10] M.

Two or three days before the\r\narrival of the Allied Fleet he had initiated conversations in that sense\r\nwith the Allied Ministers.[1]\r\n\r\nSimultaneously the question of a war Government came up for discussion;\r\nthe actual Cabinet being, by order of the Allies, a mere business\r\nMinistry charged only to carry on the administration until the election\r\nof a new Parliament.\r\n\r\nTwo alternatives were suggested.  The first, which found warm favour in\r\nEntente circles, was that M. Zaimis should lay down the cares of office\r\nand make place for M. Venizelos.  Constantine was advised to \"bend his\r\nstubborn will to the inevitable and remain King of the Hellenes\"--that\r\nis, to become an ornamental captain--by abandoning the ship of State to\r\nthe management of the wise Cretan.  \"It is now possible,\" the homily ran,\r\n\"that the precipitation of events will prevent the return of M.\r\nVenizelos by the voice of the electorate.\"  But that did not signify: \"M.\r\nVenizelos can count on the backing of nine-tenths of the nation, given a\r\nsemblance of Royal support.\" [1]  In less trenchant language, the British\r\nMinister at Athens expounded the same thesis.\r\n\r\nBut Constantine showed little inclination to perform this noble act of\r\nself-effacement.  On no account would {115} he have a dictator imposed\r\nupon him to shape the fortunes of Greece according to his caprice,\r\nunfettered by \"military advisers of limited perceptions.\"  If Greece was\r\nto have a dictator, the King had said long ago, he would rather be that\r\ndictator; though he had no objection to a Cabinet with a Venizelist\r\nadmixture.  In fact, he insisted on M. Venizelos accepting a share in the\r\nresponsibility of war, either by himself sitting in the Cabinet or by\r\npermitting three of his friends to represent him in it.  \"It will not\r\ndo,\" he said frankly, \"to have his crowd standing out, trying to break up\r\nthe army and making things difficult by criticizing the Government.\" [3]\r\n\r\nThe other alternative was that M. Zaimis should be invested with\r\npolitical functions; but for this the consent of the Allies and of their\r\nprotégé was needed.  The latter, in his oration of 27 August, had\r\nmagnanimously declared himself willing, provided his policy were adopted,\r\nto leave the execution of it in the hands of M. Zaimis, whose honesty and\r\nsincerity remained above all suspicion: \"the Liberal Party,\" he had said,\r\n\"are prepared to back this Cabinet of Affairs with their political\r\nauthority.\"  On being asked by M. Zaimis to explain precisely what he\r\nmeant, M. Venizelos broached the subject of elections.  As already seen,\r\nhe and the Allies had reason to regret and to elude the test which they\r\nhad exacted.  It was, therefore, not surprising that M. Venizelos should\r\nstipulate, with the concurrence of the Entente Ministers, that the\r\nelections now imminent be postponed to the Greek Kalends.[4]  By\r\naccepting this condition, M. Zaimis obtained a promise of support; and\r\nstraightway (2 Sept.) proceeded to sound London and Paris.\r\n\r\nBefore making any formal proposal, he wanted to know if the Western\r\nPowers would at least afford Greece the money and equipment which she\r\nrequired in order to prepare with a view to eventual action.  England\r\nwelcomed these overtures, convinced that thus all misunderstandings\r\nbetween Greece and the Allies would vanish; {116} but, before giving a\r\ndefinite reply, she had to communicate with France.  France manifested\r\nthe greatest satisfaction; but M. Briand urged that there was no time for\r\nnegotiations: the vital interests of Greece demanded immediate action:\r\nshe should hasten to make a formal declaration without delay; after which\r\nhe would do all that was necessary to provide her, as soon as possible,\r\nwith money and material.  M. Zaimis in his very first dispatch had said:\r\n\"Unfortunately the state of our finances and of our military organization\r\ndoes not permit us to think of immediate action: we need a certain delay\r\nfor preparation\"; and all the exhortations of M. Briand to leap first and\r\nlook afterwards failed to move him.  Besides the matter of equipment--a\r\nmatter in which the Entente Powers, owing to their own necessities, had\r\nbeen the reverse of liberal to their small allies, as Belgium and Servia\r\nhad already found, and Rumania was about to find to her cost--there was\r\nanother point Greek statesmen and strategists had to weigh very carefully\r\nbefore committing themselves: would Rumania co-ordinate her military\r\naction with theirs?  Unless she were inclined and able to divert enough\r\nforces from the Austro-Hungarian to the Bulgarian frontier, her entry\r\ninto the War could not be of any help to them.  So, after nine days'\r\ncorrespondence, we find M. Zaimis still writing: \"When the English answer\r\narrives, the Royal Government will take account of it in the examination\r\nin which it will engage before taking a definite decision--a decision\r\nwhich will be subordinated to its military preparations and to the course\r\nof war operations in the East.\" [5]\r\n\r\nDirectly afterwards (11 Sept.) M. Zaimis resigned \"for reasons of\r\nhealth.\"  These reasons convinced no one: everyone agreed in ascribing\r\nhis withdrawal to his discovery that he was the victim of duplicity; but\r\nas to whose duplicity, opinions differed.  According to M.  Venizelos,\r\nwhile the conversations about entering the War went on, King Constantine,\r\nin consequence of a telegram from the {117} Kaiser assuring him that\r\nwithin a month the Germans would have overrun Rumania and flung Sarrail's\r\narmy into the sea, and asking him to hold out, reverted to the policy of\r\nneutrality; and M. Zaimis, realizing that he was being fooled, refused to\r\nplay the King's game and resigned.[6]  For this statement we have M.\r\nVenizelos's authority; and against it that of M. Zaimis, who, on hearing\r\nfrom Paris that his resignation gave rise to the supposition that the old\r\npolicy had prevailed, replied: \"My impression is that the Cabinet which\r\nwill succeed me will not quit the line of policy which I have pursued.\"\r\n[7]\r\n\r\nAnother account connected the fall of the Cabinet with an incident which\r\noccurred at that critical moment and strained the situation to the\r\nutmost.  In the evening of 9 September, as the Entente Ministers held a\r\nconference in the French Legation, a score of scallywags rushed into the\r\ncourtyard, shouting \"Long live the King!  Down with France and England!\"\r\nfired a few revolver shots in the air, and bolted.  Immediately M. Zaimis\r\nhastened to the Legation and expressed his regrets.  But that did not\r\nsuffice to placate the outraged honour of the French Republic.  Despite\r\nthe objections of his colleagues, M.  Guillemin had a detachment of\r\nbluejackets landed to guard the Legation; and next day a Note was\r\npresented to the Greek Premier demanding that the perpetrators of this\r\ngrave breach of International Law should be discovered and punished, and\r\nthat all Reservists' leagues should instantly be broken up.  It was even\r\nproposed that the King should be asked to issue a Proclamation disavowing\r\nand condemning the demonstration.  Inquiry proved that the demonstration\r\nwas the work of _agents provocateurs_ in the pay of the French Secret\r\nService which acted in the interest of M. Venizelos.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, M. Zaimis, realizing that the negotiations he was trying to\r\nconduct could not be sincere on the part of the French, begged to be\r\nrelieved of his mandate.  The King was loth to let him go.  The British\r\nMinister was equally upset, and added his plea to that of the Sovereign.\r\nM. Zaimis said that, if M. Guillemin disavowed {118} the intrigue and\r\ndisplayed a willingness to continue the negotiations in a spirit of\r\ncandour, he would remain; but M. Guillemin could not bring himself to go\r\nso far.[8]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the truth in this matter--for, owing to lack of\r\ndocumentary evidence, it is impossible fully to ascertain the truth--the\r\nwhole position, for a man of M. Zaimis's character, was untenable: if\r\nsense of duty had prompted him to take up the burden, common-sense\r\ncounselled him to lay it down.  So he resigned; and the fat was once more\r\nin the fire--and the blaze and the stench were greater than ever; for his\r\nresignation synchronized with another untoward event.\r\n\r\nColonel Hatzopoulos with his own and the Serres Division had for some\r\ntime past been isolated at Cavalla--the Bulgars occupying the forts on\r\none side, while the British blockaded the harbour on the other.\r\nSuddenly, upon a false report that King Constantine had fled to Larissa\r\nand Venizelos was master at Athens, the demeanour of the Bulgars, which\r\nhad always been harsh, became thoroughly hostile.  They strengthened\r\ntheir outposts, cut off the food supplies that came from Drama and\r\nSerres, and, on 6 September, demanded that the heights immediately above\r\nthe town still held by the Greeks should be abandoned to them, on the\r\nplea that otherwise they would be unable to defend themselves in case of\r\nan Entente landing: refusal would be considered an unfriendly act.  As\r\nhis orders forbade resistance, Colonel Hatzopoulos had no choice but to\r\nyield.  Thus the Greeks were reduced to absolute helplessness; and their\r\nisolation was completed on 9 September, when British sailors landed and\r\ndestroyed the wireless station.\r\n\r\nThe worst was yet to come.  Next morning (10 Sept.) a German officer\r\nperemptorily notified Colonel Hatzopoulos on the part of Marshal von\r\nHindenburg that, as the Greek troops scattered over Eastern Macedonia\r\nobstructed the operations of the Bulgarian army, they should all be\r\nconcentrated at Drama.  Colonel Hatzopoulos, perceiving that compliance\r\nmeant captivity in the hands of the Bulgars, asked that, as his\r\ninstructions were that all the troops should concentrate at Cavalla, and\r\nas he could not act otherwise without orders from the King, he might be\r\n{119} allowed to send a messenger to Athens via Monastir.  This being\r\nrefused on the ground that the journey would take too long, he pleaded\r\nhis inability to decide about so grave a matter on his own initiative,\r\nbut must call a council of the principal officers.  Meanwhile, in order\r\nto avoid capture by the Bulgars, he asked if, should they decide to\r\nsurrender, Hindenburg would guarantee their transportation to Germany\r\nwith their arms.  The German promised to communicate with headquarters\r\nand to let him know the answer on the following morning.\r\n\r\nEvidently the invaders, who would formerly have been more than content\r\nwith the withdrawal of the Greek forces, were now--in violation of the\r\npledges given to Athens by the German and Bulgarian Governments--resolved\r\non making such withdrawal impossible.  It is not hard to account for this\r\nchange.  The pledges were given in the belief that Greece would continue\r\nneutral.  This belief had been shaken not only by the Venizelist\r\nmovement, but more severely still by M. Zaimis's soundings of the Entente\r\nPowders.  The Greek Premier had from the first insisted on secrecy,\r\nstating among the main reasons which rendered absolute discretion\r\nimperative, \"the presence in part of our territory of the eventual\r\nadversary,\" and \"the need to extricate two divisions and a large quantity\r\nof material\" from their grip.[9]  Nevertheless, the Entente Press gloried\r\nin the hope that the Allies would soon have the only non-belligerent\r\nBalkan State fighting on their side, and the principal Entente news\r\nagency trumpeted abroad M. Zaimis's confidential conversations.[10]\r\nHence the desire of the Germano-Bulgars to prevent the escape of men and\r\nmaterial that might at any moment be used against them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Greek officers' council decided {120} to try first\r\nevery means of escape, and only if that proved impossible to comply with\r\nthe German demand on condition that they should be taken to Germany and\r\nnot be left in the hands of the Bulgars.  Accordingly, Colonel\r\nHatzopoulos addressed a most earnest appeal to the British for vessels to\r\nget his men away to Volo or the Piraeus, and, having received a promise\r\nto that effect, he secretly arranged for flight.  In the night of 10\r\nSeptember all the men with their belongings gathered on the sea-front\r\nready to leave.  But they reckoned without the partisans of M. Venizelos\r\nin their midst.  One of them, the Commandant of the Serres Division, a\r\nmonth ago had informed General Sarrail that he would fight on the side of\r\nthe Allies,[11] and another on 5 September, in a nocturnal meeting on\r\nboard a British man-of-war, had proposed to kidnap Colonel Hatzopoulos,\r\narm volunteers, and attack the Bulgars with the aid of Allied detachments\r\nlanded at Cavalla.  His proposal having been rejected, it was agreed that\r\nall \"patriotic\" elements should be transported to Salonica.  In pursuance\r\nof this agreement, only those were allowed to embark who were willing to\r\nrebel.  Those who refused to break their oath of allegiance to their King\r\nwere turned adrift.  Some tried to gain the island of Thasos, but their\r\nboats were carried to the open sea and capsized, drowning many, the rest\r\ngot back to the shore in despair.\r\n\r\nAs a last hope of escape, Colonel Hatzopoulos begged the British naval\r\nauthorities, who controlled all means of communication between Cavalla\r\nand Athens, to transmit to his Government a message asking if he might\r\nsurrender to the British and be interned in the isle of Thasos.  The\r\nmessage was duly transmitted through the British Legation on 11\r\nSeptember, and in reply the Greek Minister of War, after an understanding\r\nwith the British authorities, ordered him through the same channel to\r\nembark at once with all his men and, if possible, material for Volo, on\r\nGreek ships by preference, but if such were not available, on any other\r\nships.  Whether these orders were never forwarded, or whether they\r\nreached their destination too late, is not quite clear.  It is certain,\r\nhowever, that during the critical hours when the fate of the unhappy\r\nsoldiers hung in the balance, the British Fleet did not permit\r\nembarkation {121} except to the few who joined the Rebellion.[12]  For\r\nthe loyal majority there was nothing left but the way to Drama.\r\n\r\nNor was any time allowed for vacillation.  When, in the morning of 11\r\nSeptember, Colonel Hatzopoulos met the German officer, the latter handed\r\nto him a telegram from Hindenburg, guaranteeing the transport of the\r\nGreeks to Germany with their arms, where they would be treated as guests.\r\nHe added that the departure from Cavalla would not be enforced for the\r\npresent.  But in the afternoon he intimated that this was due to a\r\nmisunderstanding, and that they should leave the same night.  Their\r\nefforts to escape had obviously become known to the Germans, who, taking\r\nno chances, imposed immediate departure under threat to cancel\r\nHindenburg's guarantee.  Thus, the two Greek divisions were under\r\ncompulsion huddled off to Drama, whence, joined by the division stationed\r\nthere, they were taken to Germany and interned at Goerlitz.[13]\r\n\r\nNothing that had hitherto happened served so well to blacken the rulers\r\nof Greece in the eyes of the Entente publics, and the mystery which\r\nenveloped the affair facilitated the propagation of fiction.  It was\r\nasserted that the surrendered troops amounted to 25,000--even to 40,000:\r\nfigures which were presently reduced to \"some 8,000: three divisions,\r\neach composed of three regiments of 800 men each.\"  The surrender was\r\nrepresented as made by order of the Athens Government: King Constantine,\r\nout of affection for Germany and Bulgaria, and hate of {122} France and\r\nEngland, had given up, not only rich territories he himself had\r\nconquered, but also the soldiers he had twice led to victory.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, as soon as the Athens Government heard of the\r\ncatastrophe--and it did not hear of it until after the arrival of the\r\nfirst detachment in Germany--it addressed to Berlin a remonstrance,\r\ndisavowing the step of Colonel Hatzopoulos as contrary to his orders, and\r\ndenying Germany's right to keep him as contrary to International Law:\r\n\"for Greece being in peaceful and friendly relations with Germany, the\r\nGreek troops can neither be treated as prisoners of war nor be interned,\r\ninternment being only possible in a neutral country, and only with regard\r\nto belligerent troops--not vice versa.\"  The dispatch ended with a\r\nrequest that \"our troops with their arms and baggage be transported to\r\nthe Swiss frontier, whence they may go to some Mediterranean port and\r\nreturn to Greece on ships which we shall send for the purpose.\" [14]\r\n\r\nBerlin answered that she \"was ready to meet the desire of the Greek\r\nGovernment, but actual and effective guarantees would have to be given\r\nthat the troops under German protection would not be prevented by the\r\nEntente Powers from returning to their fatherland, and would not be\r\npunished for their loyal and neutral feeling and action.\" [15]  This\r\nbecause the Entente press was angrily denouncing the step as a\r\n\"disgraceful desertion\" and asking \"with what ignominious penalty their\r\nWar Lord has visited so signal and so heinous an act of mutiny, perjury,\r\nand treason on the part of his soldiers\" [16]--the soldiers who went to\r\nGermany precisely in order to avoid committing an act of mutiny, perjury,\r\nand treason.  Truly, in time of war words change their meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See _Constantine I and the Greek People_.

Hatzopoulos to Marshal von Hindenburg, dated \"Goerlitz, 13/26\r\nOct., 1916,\" and another report drawn up at Athens in July, 1921, from\r\nthe records of the judicial investigation instituted by the Venizelos\r\nGovernment in 1919, including the evidence of the British Vice-Consul G.\r\nG. Knox.\r\n\r\n[14] _White Book_, No. 173.\r\n\r\n[15] Telegram from Berlin reported by Renter's Amsterdam Correspondent,\r\n23 Sept., 1916.  I find this confirmed by a dispatch from the Greek\r\nMinister at Berlin (Theotokis, Berlin, 18/31 Oct., 1916), in which he\r\ngives an account of his efforts to obtain from the German Government the\r\nreturn of the troops and restitution of the war material, as well as the\r\nGreek officers' protests to Hindenburg and Ludendorff against the\r\npressure under which they had been hurried from Cavalla.  It is to be\r\nregretted that M. Venizelos did not find room for this document and for\r\nCol. Hatzopoulos's illuminating Report in his _White Book_.\r\n\r\n[16] Leading article in _The Times_, 19 Sept., 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{123}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the unfortunate King of Greece was faced by a state of things\r\nwhich he himself describes with admirable lucidity in a dispatch to his\r\nbrother Andrew, then in London, labouring, vainly enough, to obtain a\r\nfair hearing for the Royalist side, while another brother, Prince\r\nNicholas, was engaged on a similar mission at Petrograd.  The document is\r\ndated 3/16 September, 1916, and runs thus:\r\n\r\n\"The resignation of the Cabinet of M. Zaimis, who enjoyed my absolute\r\nconfidence, as well as the unanimous confidence of the country, and whom\r\nthe Entente Governments declared to me that they surrounded with their\r\nentire sympathy, has rendered the situation very difficult.\r\n\r\n\"I charged M. Dimitracopoulos to form a new Cabinet.  He declared himself\r\nready to continue the conversations opened recently by M.  Zaimis in the\r\nhope of bringing them to a happy conclusion.  Before accepting\r\ndefinitely, he thought it necessary to sound the views of the Powers on\r\nimportant questions of an internal order, and went to the _doyen_ of the\r\nDiplomatic Corps, the British Minister, whence he carried away a very\r\nclear impression that, not only the coercive measures would not be raised\r\nbefore mobilization, but that they might be intensified, notably by\r\ndirect interference in personal domestic questions, and that, even after\r\nmobilization, the measures would be only relaxed.  As to the question of\r\nelections, after having demanded by the Note of 8 (21) June the\r\ndissolution of the Chamber and new elections, which we accepted, now they\r\ndemand that the elections shall not take place, without, at the same\r\ntime, allowing the existing Chamber to meet.  M. Dimitracopoulos has laid\r\ndown his mandate.\r\n\r\n\"Under these conditions the situation becomes inextricable.  The military\r\nand naval authorities of the Entente foment and encourage in the country\r\na revolution and armed sedition, and they favour by every means the {124}\r\nSalonica movement by continuing the vexatious measures and restricting\r\nall freedom of thought and action.  The Entente Ministers paralyze all\r\nGovernment.  Thus the country is pushed towards anarchy.\r\n\r\n\"Such conduct not only conflicts with the assurances which they have\r\ngiven us, but excludes all practical possibility of reconsidering our\r\npolicy freely to the end of taking a decision in a favourable direction.\r\nFor the rest, Greece divided would not be of any use as an ally.  It is\r\nnecessary that there should return in the country comparative calm and\r\nthe feeling of independence, indispensable for taking extreme\r\nresolutions.  It is necessary that confidence in the sympathy of the\r\nEntente should be restored.  A resolution to participate in the war taken\r\nunder present circumstances would run the risk of being attributed to\r\nviolence and of being received with mistrust.  More, that resolutions may\r\nbe taken without danger of disaster, there is need of circumspection and\r\ndiscretion, so as not to provoke an attack from the Germano-Bulgars who\r\nare in our territory, before we are ready to lend real assistance to the\r\nEntente.  A more definite declaration of principle, which would have to\r\nbe kept secret in the common interest, would be of no practical value.\r\n\r\n\"Under certain circumstances, rendering the participation of Greece\r\nuseful and conformable to our interests, I have already declared that I\r\nam ready to enter into the war on the side of the Entente.  I am ready to\r\nenvisage negotiations in this sense.  But, before all, I need, that I may\r\nbe able to occupy myself usefully and with a certain mental calmness with\r\nforeign questions, to see comparative quiet restored at home, and so to\r\nsave the appearances of liberty of action.  In this I ask, for the sake\r\nof the common interest, the Powers to give me their help.\r\n\r\n\"I have charged M. Calogeropoulos to form a Ministry: he is equally\r\nanimated by the best intentions towards the Entente.\"\r\n\r\nThe new Premier, who had already held office with distinction as Minister\r\nof the Interior and as Minister of Finance, possessed every qualification\r\nfor the delicate task entrusted to him.  On the day of his accession _The\r\nTimes_ Correspondent wrote of him: \"In the Chamber he is highly esteemed.\r\nAlthough he is a Theotokist, and {125} therefore anti-Venizelist, M.\r\nCalogeropoulos, who studied in France, declared to me that all his\r\npersonal sympathies are with the Entente.  He is likewise a member of the\r\nFranco-Greek League.\" [1]  In harmony with this character was his\r\nprogramme: \"The new Cabinet, inspired by the same policy as M. Zaimis, is\r\nresolved to pursue it with the sincere desire to tighten the bonds\r\nbetween Greece and the Entente Powers.\" This declaration, made in every\r\nAllied capital, was supplemented by a more intimate announcement in Paris\r\nand London: \"Sharing the views which inspired the negotiations opened by\r\nits predecessor, the Royal Government is resolved to pursue them in the\r\nsame spirit.\" [2]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had M. Calogeropoulos spoken than M. Venizelos set to work to\r\ncast doubts on his sincerity, with remarkable success: \"M. Venizelos does\r\nnot believe that the composition of the new Ministry permits of the hope\r\nthat a national policy will be adopted, since it springs from a party of\r\npro-German traditions,\" [3]--this ominous paragraph was added by the\r\n_Times_ Correspondent to his report the same day.  And next day the\r\nBritish Minister, in an interview with the editor of a Venizelist\r\njournal, said: \"The situation is certainly not an agreeable one.  I have\r\nread in the papers the declaration of the new Premier.  What has\r\nsurprised me is to find that M. Calogeropoulos characterized his Ministry\r\nas a political one, whereas in their last Note the Allies required that\r\nGreece should be governed by a business Cabinet.  This, as you see, makes\r\na distinct difference.\" [4]  Simultaneously, the Entente Press, under\r\nsimilar inspiration, reviled the new Cabinet as pro-German, clamoured for\r\nM. Venizelos, whom they still represented as the true exponent of the\r\nnational will, threatened King Constantine with the fate of King Otho,\r\nand his country with \"terrible and desperate things.\" [5]\r\n\r\n{126}\r\n\r\nIt was in such an atmosphere that M. Calogeropoulos and his colleagues\r\nattempted to resume the conversations which M. Zaimis had opened.  They\r\nrealized that, since elections and like legal methods no longer commended\r\nthemselves to the Allies, since they menaced the country with \"terrible\r\nand desperate things,\" Greece might drift into chaos at any moment.  They\r\nwere anxious to avoid chaos.  But how?  A blind acceptance of the\r\nVenizelist policy of an immediate rush into the War, without regard to\r\nways and means, might prove tantamount to burning one's blanket in order\r\nto get rid of the fleas: while saving Greece from the coercion of the\r\nFrench and the British, it might expose her to subjugation by the Germans\r\nand the Bulgars: the plight of Rumania afforded a fresh warning.  They\r\ntherefore adopted the only course open to sane men.\r\n\r\nOn 19 September Greece formally offered to the Entente Powers \"to come in\r\nas soon as by their help she had accomplished the repair of her military\r\nforces, within a period fixed by common accord.\"  But, \"as her armed\r\nintervention could not, obviously, be in the interest of anyone\r\nconcerned, unless it took place with chances of success, the Royal\r\nGovernment thinks that Greece should not be held to her engagement, if at\r\nthe time fixed the Balkan theatre of war presented, in the opinion of the\r\nAllies' General Staffs themselves, such a disequilibrium of forces as the\r\nmilitary weight of Greece would be insufficient to redress.\" [6]\r\n\r\nRussia received these advances with cordiality, her Premier declaring to\r\nthe Greek Minister at Petrograd that she would be happy to have Greece\r\nfor an ally, and that the Tsar had full confidence in the sentiments of\r\nKing Constantine.  He added that he would immediately communicate with\r\nParis and London.[7]  There was the rub.  French and British statesmen\r\naffected to regard the offer as a ruse for gaining time: they could not\r\ntrust a Cabinet three members of which they considered to be ill-disposed\r\ntowards the Entente: a \"national policy\" {127} should be carried out by a\r\n\"national Cabinet\"--that is, by M.  Venizelos.[8]\r\n\r\nWhile frustrating his country's efforts to find a way out of the pass\r\ninto which he had intrigued it, the Cretan and his partisans did not\r\nneglect other forms of activity.  We have seen that rebellion had already\r\nbroken out at Salonica.  In Athens itself the walls were pasted with\r\nVenizelist newspapers in the form of placards displaying headlines such\r\nas these: \"A LAST APPEAL TO THE KING!\"  \"DRAW THE SWORD, O KING, OR\r\nABDICATE!\"  It was no secret that arms and ammunition were stored in\r\nprivate houses, that the French Intelligence Service had a depot of\r\nexplosives in a ship moored at the Piraeus, and a magazine of rifles and\r\ngrenades in its headquarters at the French School of Athens.[9] The\r\nRoyalist journals threatened the Venizelists with condign punishment for\r\ntheir treasonable designs.  The Venizelist journals, far from denying the\r\ncharge, replied that they would be fully justified in arming themselves\r\nagainst the hostile Reservist Leagues.  In short, the capital swarmed\r\nwith conspirators, but the guardians of public order were powerless,\r\nowing to the proximity of the Allied naval guns, ready to enforce respect\r\nfor the Allied flags under whose protection the conspiracy was carried\r\non.  By this time the French and British detectives had usurped the\r\npowers and inverted the functions of the police organs;[10] and the\r\nFrench and {128} British agents, after fomenting those fatal differences\r\nwhich divide and degrade a people, had developed into directors of plots\r\nand organizers of sedition.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of such encouragement, the capital--or, indeed, any part of\r\nOld Greece--had never appealed to M. Venizelos as a starting-point of\r\nsedition.  He knew that only in the recently acquired and as yet\r\nimperfectly assimilated regions--regions under the direct influence of\r\nthe Allies--he could hope to rebel with safety.  His plan embraced,\r\nbesides Salonica, the islands conquered in 1912, particularly his native\r\nCrete.  In that home of immemorial turbulence his friends, seconded by\r\nBritish Secret Service and Naval officers, had found many retired bandits\r\neager to resume work.  Even there, it is true, public opinion was not\r\nstrikingly favourable to disloyalty; but the presence of the British\r\nFleet in Suda Bay had much of persuasion in it.[11]\r\n\r\nOur diplomacy did not openly commit itself.  Sir Francis Elliot still\r\nnursed the hope of effecting a reconciliation between the ex-Premier and\r\nhis King.  When, in August, a conference was secretly held at Athens\r\nbetween M. Venizelos and a number of Cretan conspirators, the latter\r\ncarried back the depressing intelligence that British official sympathy\r\nwith their project lacked the necessary degree of warmth.  And again, on\r\n11 September, when the British Consul of Canea went over to Athens with\r\nsome of those conspirators, he was ordered by the British Legation to\r\nstay there, so as to avoid any suspicion of complicity.  This attitude of\r\ncorrect reserve on the part of the British Foreign Office, however, did\r\nnot prevent the British naval authorities on the spot from working out,\r\nin concert with the insurgents, a plan of operations under which some\r\nchieftains were to invest the coast towns on the land side, while our\r\nmen-of-war patrolled the sea in their interest.[12]\r\n\r\n{129}\r\n\r\nFrance, on the other hand, made no distinction between diplomatic and\r\nnaval action.  On 18 September M. Guillemin informed Admiral Dartige du\r\nFournet that M. Venizelos was sailing for the islands, and orders were\r\ngiven for a French escort.  But at the last moment M. Venizelos did not\r\nsail.  He hesitated.  The French Secret Service urged the National Leader\r\nto lead, instead of being prodded from behind; but he resisted their\r\npressure and their plain speaking.[13]  When questioned by the Associated\r\nPress Correspondent if there was any truth in the reports that he was\r\ngoing to put himself at the head of the revolutionary forces, he replied:\r\n\"I cannot answer now.  I must wait a little while yet and see what the\r\nGovernment propose to do.\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this was the reason why M. Venizelos paused\r\nirresolute on the brink.  It is possible that he suffered, as the\r\ndisrespectful Frenchmen hinted, from one of those attacks of timidity to\r\nwhich he was subject in a crisis.  It is possible that the ambiguous\r\nattitude of England damped his martial spirit.  For the rest, to make a\r\nrevolution is a matter that may well give the strongest-minded pause.\r\nWhat wonder if, reckless, obstinate, and unscrupulous as he was, M.\r\nVenizelos, when faced with the irrevocable, felt the need to weigh his\r\nposition, to reconsider whether the momentous step he was taking was\r\nnecessary, was right, was prudent?\r\n\r\nHowever, events soon put an end to his hesitation.  The decisive\r\nevent--the hair which turned the scale--according to M. Venizelos\r\nhimself, was supplied, appropriately enough, by a barber.  One day,\r\nwhilst the Leader of the Liberals wrestled with his soul, a friend called\r\nand reported to him a talk he had just had with his hairdresser, \"a\r\nterrible Venizelist, who spoke thus: 'We here, simple folk, say that\r\nVenizelos bears a heavy responsibility: he tells us we are going to the\r\ndogs.  Eh, well then, why doesn't he stop us?'  This conversation shook\r\nme deeply.  My friend gone, I said to myself: 'Indeed, this barber speaks\r\nwisely, and my hesitations to discharge my duty to the end must vanish,\r\nbecause they may possibly spring from purely egotistical motives.  Sir, I\r\nsaid to myself, having laid up from many struggles and many successes\r\n{130} a capital above the average, you don't wish to risk it and think it\r\nbetter to sit quiet, choosing to enjoy the moral satisfaction of seeing\r\nthe fulfilment of your prophecies rather than make an effort to prevent\r\nit.'\" [14]  It is always interesting to trace mighty events to trifling\r\ncauses; and it would have been particularly pleasant to believe that the\r\ndestinies of Greece for once literally stood \"on a razor's edge.\" [15]\r\nBut we will do M. Venizelos the credit of believing him less childish\r\nthan he represents himself.  There were weightier things \"to shake\" him\r\ninto a decision.\r\n\r\nOn 20 September, when, according to plan, he was due in Crete, the train\r\nlaid there exploded.  His friends had come down from the hills thirsting\r\nfor the blood of Greek and Mohammedan victims: should the massacre they\r\nmeditated take place, M. Venizelos would never leave Athens alive.[16]\r\nThe news was of a nature to compel him at last to take the plunge; and in\r\nthe small hours of 25 September, the National Leader stole out of Greece\r\non a ship escorted by a French torpedo-boat.  His flight had been\r\norganized by the French Secret Service like a carnival masquerade, on the\r\npainful details of which, says Admiral Dartige, it would be better not to\r\ndwell.[17]\r\n\r\nHis advent in Crete had been so efficiently prepared by the British\r\nSecret Service and naval officers--without whom there would have been\r\nneither mutiny nor insurrection--that, on landing, M. Venizelos had\r\nnothing to do but instal himself in the best hotel at Canea and proclaim\r\nhimself with his confederate Admiral Coundouriotis the Provisional\r\nGovernment.[18]\r\n\r\nUnder the fostering care of the Allied men-of-war the movement spread to\r\nSamos, Mytilene, Chios, Lemnos, and Thasos, where the constitutional\r\noperations witnessed in Crete were duly repeated.  But all the other\r\nislands and the mainland--that is, the whole of the Hellenic Kingdom,\r\nwith the exception of the new territories--adhered {131} steadfastly to\r\nthe person and the policy of their King.  As for the armed forces of the\r\nCrown, Admiral Coundouriotis had hoped by his prestige, deservedly high\r\nsince the Balkan wars, to bring away with him the whole or a large part\r\nof the Fleet: he brought away only two torpedo-boats and another small\r\nunit, the desertion of which was effected by a trick, \"for which,\" says\r\nthe French Admiral, \"France would have cause to blush.\" [19]\r\n\r\nIn itself the Venizelist movement, as a disruptive force, was\r\nnegligible.[20]  But the co-operation of the French Republic and the\r\nBritish Empire invested it with an alarming significance.\r\n\r\nM. Calogeropoulos and his colleagues who watched this rising tempest\r\nanxiously did everything they could to conjure it.  Although to their\r\noffer no reply was given, on hearing informally that the Entente Powers\r\nwould not accept the proffered alliance unless Greece declared war on\r\nBulgaria at once, they signified their willingness so to do, if, content\r\nwith that, the Entente would accord Greece adequate military and\r\nfinancial assistance during the struggle and support her territorial\r\nclaims at the conclusion of peace; if, in addition, M.  Briand deemed the\r\nCabinet question of immediate importance, they were prepared to solve it\r\ndefinitely for the sake of restoring complete harmony between Greece and\r\nthe Entente Powers.[21]\r\n\r\nThe authors of this message were given to understand that the reply would\r\nbe handed to King Constantine himself, the Entente Governments declining\r\nto recognize the actual Cabinet; that it would be in the form of an\r\nultimatum, demanding that Greece should declare war on Bulgaria within\r\nforty-eight hours unconditionally, after which they promised to supply\r\nher with money and munitions during the struggle and at the conclusion of\r\npeace to take into account her territorial claims as far as {132}\r\ncircumstances would permit; meanwhile, they demanded the formation of a\r\nnew Ministry, and, failing compliance, they threatened \"most energetic\r\nmeasures.\"  M. Briand kindly added that he delayed the presentation of\r\nthis ultimatum in order to give His Majesty the advantage of making a\r\nspontaneous gesture without the appearance of compulsion.[22]\r\n\r\nWhereupon (3 Oct.) M. Venizelos at Canea was sounded whether, if the\r\nCalogeropoulos Cabinet made place for one ready to declare war on\r\nBulgaria, he would insist on presiding over such a Cabinet or would be\r\nsatisfied with being represented in it by some of his partisans.\r\n\r\nThese overtures may be regarded as a last attempt on the part of Athens\r\nto take the Cretan at his word.  For M. Venizelos had never tired of\r\nprofessing his willingness to support any Government which would adopt\r\nhis policy of prompt action: it was not personal power he hungered after,\r\nbut national prosperity.  Even at the moment of going to head a\r\nrebellion, he had not ceased to proclaim his patriotic unselfishness.[23]\r\nWe have seen to what extent hitherto his actions had accorded with his\r\nprofessions: how adroitly he had maintained abroad the reputation,\r\nwithout incurring the sacrifices, of magnanimity.  Once more he gave\r\nproof of the same adroitness:\r\n\r\n\"True to his previous declarations, M. Venizelos replied that he was\r\nready to give his support and that of his party to a Government which\r\nwould declare war on Bulgaria, and that he asked neither to preside over\r\nsuch a Government nor to be represented in it by his partisans.  As a\r\npatriot and a statesman, seeking only his country's welfare,\" etc., etc.,\r\netc.  But--\"the principal followers of M. Venizelos do not believe that\r\nthis new step taken by the authorities at Athens indicates a change in\r\nthe right direction in the councils of the Palace.  They maintain that\r\nthe idea behind this _démarche_ is simply to gain time.  I have pressed\r\nM. Venizelos on this, and, although he did not wish to appear to be as\r\nemphatic as his followers, he had to admit to me that he had no illusions\r\nand that he remained sceptical.  If King Constantine is really {133}\r\nsincere, he can give a proof which will allay all doubts.  Let him order\r\na mobilization at once . . . and call in M. Venizelos to form a new\r\nGovernment.\" [24]\r\n\r\nKing Constantine, instead of treating the Cretan as a rebel, still wished\r\nto treat him as a responsible citizen, and by his moderation to give him\r\nan opportunity of a decent return to legal order.  But he could not, even\r\nif he wished, call to power a man in open revolt: by so doing he would\r\nalienate the loyal majority without conciliating the disloyal minority.\r\n\r\nAfter thus burning the last boat that might have carried him back to\r\nlegality, M. Venizelos took the first boat that travelled in the opposite\r\ndirection.  He left Suda Bay on 5 October, amidst the cheers of the\r\nAllied squadrons, bound for Salonica by way of Samos and Mytilene.  At\r\nSamos he received a fresh token of the approval with which the Entente\r\nviewed his operations: the commander of a British man-of-war, acting on\r\ninstructions, officially called on him and paid his respects.[25]\r\n\r\nAnd so he reached Salonica, took up his abode at the royal residence, and\r\nwith Admiral Coundouriotis and General Danglis composed a Triumvirate\r\nwhich, having appointed a Ministry, began to levy taxes and troops, and\r\nto negotiate for a loan.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphosis of a Prime Minister into an insurgent chief, though a\r\nremarkable phenomenon, is no matter for surprise.  M. Venizelos sprang\r\nfrom people among whom insurrection formed the traditional method of\r\nasserting political opinions.  His father was a veteran of the Greek\r\nRevolution of 1821, and passed most of his life plotting.  His\r\ngrandfather is supposed to have been a refugee of the earlier Greek\r\nrevolt of 1770.[26]  He himself had grown up amidst vivid echoes of the\r\nCretan Rebellion of 1866.  While contact with the frock-coated world of\r\n{134} modern Europe during the latter period of his career had clothed\r\nhim with a statesman's proper external circumstance, it had not\r\neradicated the primitive instincts implanted in him by heredity and\r\nfostered by environment.  Sedition was in his blood, which perhaps\r\nexplains the _flair_--the almost uncanny _flair_--he had for the business.\r\n\r\nNor did he lack experience.  After sharing in one Cretan insurrection\r\nagainst the Sultan in 1896, he led another against Prince George in 1905.\r\nThis exploit--known as the Therisos Movement--deserves special notice,\r\nfor it bears a curious and most instructive analogy to the enterprise\r\nwith which we are now dealing.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 M. Venizelos became a member of the first Cretan Administration\r\nappointed by the High Commissioner, Prince George--King Constantine's\r\nbrother.  The status of the island was provisional, and the fulfilment of\r\nthe national desire for union with Greece depended partly on the policy\r\nof the Powers which had combined to act as its Protectors, partly on the\r\nprudence of the islanders themselves and of their continental kinsmen.\r\nSuch was the situation when, in 1901, M.  Venizelos suddenly conceived\r\nthe idea of turning Crete into an autonomous principality.  Prince George\r\nobjected to the proposal, arguing that neither in Crete nor in Greece\r\nwould public opinion approve it.  M. Venizelos sounded the Hellenic\r\nGovernment and the Opposition, and was told by both that, from the\r\nstandpoint of national interest and sentiment, his scheme was absolutely\r\nunacceptable.  Nevertheless, he persevered and succeeded in forming a\r\nparty to support his views.  It may be, as he affirmed, that his scheme\r\nwas a merely temporary expedient intended to pave the way to ultimate\r\nunion.  But the Greeks, interpreting it as a proposal for perpetual\r\nseparation, remained bitterly hostile, and the fact that autonomy was\r\nknown to be favoured in certain foreign quarters deepened their\r\nresentment.  M.  Venizelos was roundly denounced as a tool of foreign\r\nPowers, and Prince George was accused of complicity, and threatened with\r\nthe lot of a traitor unless he dismissed him.  The High Commissioner made\r\nuse of the right which the Constitution of the island gave him, and M.\r\nVenizelos was dismissed (March, 1901).\r\n\r\nA truceless war against the Administration and everyone {135} connected\r\nwith it ensued.  Prince George was attacked--not directly, but through\r\nhis entourage--as a born autocrat holding in scorn the rights of the\r\npeople, tyrannizing over the Press, persecuting all those who refused to\r\nbow to his will, aiming at the subversion of free institutions.  At first\r\nthis campaign met with more success abroad than at home.  The Cretan\r\npeople expressed its opinion by its vote: among the sixty-four deputies\r\nelected to the Chamber in 1903 there were only four Venizelists.\r\n\r\nHis defeat did not daunt M. Venizelos, who, after a brief repose, resumed\r\noperations.  He hesitated at no calumny, at no outrageous invention, to\r\nget even with his adversaries.  Charges of all kinds poured in upon the\r\nPrince.  Speeches which he had never made were attributed to him, and\r\nspeeches which he did make were systematically misreported and\r\nmisinterpreted.  At last, in 1904, when Prince George decided to visit\r\nthe Governments of the Protecting Powers in order to beg them to bring\r\nabout the union of Crete with Greece by stages, M.  Venizelos, dropping\r\nthe scheme which had lost him his popularity, rushed in with an\r\nuncompromising demand for immediate union, though he knew perfectly well\r\nthat such a solution was impracticable.  The Cretans knew it, too.  On\r\nfinding that they looked upon his change of creed with suspicion, he\r\nresolved to seize by violence what he could not gain by his eloquence.\r\nWith some 600 armed partisans (out of a population of 300,000) he took to\r\nthe hills (March, 1905), called for the convocation of a National\r\nAssembly to revise the Constitution, and meanwhile urged the people to\r\nboycott the impending elections.  Despite his speeches and his bravoes,\r\nonly 9,000 out of the 64,000 electors abstained from voting; and most of\r\nthem abstained for other reasons than the wish to show sympathy with the\r\ninsurgents.\r\n\r\nThe High Commissioner wrote to the Powers at the time: \"If M. Venizelos\r\nwas truly animated by the desire to defend constitutional institutions,\r\nhe would have come before the electors with his programme and, whatever\r\nthe result, he would certainly have earned more respect as a politician.\r\nBut, instead of choosing the legal road to power, he preferred to stir up\r\nan insurrection, disguising his motives under the mask of 'The National\r\nIdea,' but, {136} as is proved by his own declarations, really inspired\r\nby personal animus and party interest.  It mattered little to him how\r\ndisastrous an effect this upheaval might have on the national cause by\r\nplunging the country into civil war or into fresh anarchy.  Can anyone\r\nrecognize in this way of acting the conduct of a genuine and serious\r\npatriot?\"\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos repelled these imputations, protesting that his movement was\r\nno way directed against the Prince.  Yet it resulted in the departure of\r\nthe Prince: the Powers who went to Crete to restore order entered into\r\nrelations with the rebels; the manner in which these intimacies were\r\ncarried on and the decisions to which they led made the Prince's position\r\nuntenable, and he gave up his Commissionership in 1906.  Likewise M.\r\nVenizelos affirmed that he had not stirred up an insurrection, but only\r\nheaded a spontaneous outbreak of popular discontent.  Yet even after his\r\ntriumph he failed, in the elections of 1907, to obtain a majority.[27]\r\n\r\nThe Therisos performance in every point--plot and staging, methods and\r\nmotives--was a rehearsal for the Salonica performance.  Would the\r\ndenouement be the same?  This question taxed M. Venizelos's dialectical\r\ndexterity very severely.\r\n\r\nAt the outset he repudiated as a monstrous and malicious calumny the\r\ncommon view that his programme was to march on Athens and to dethrone the\r\nKing.  His movement was directed against the Bulgars, not against the\r\nKing or the Dynasty: \"We are neither anti-royalist nor anti-dynastic,\" he\r\ndeclared, \"we are simply patriots.\"  Only, after the liberation of Greece\r\nfrom the foreign invaders, her democratic freedom should be assured by a\r\nthorough elucidation of the duties and rights of the Crown--a revision of\r\nthe Constitution to be effected through a National Assembly.[28]\r\n\r\nSo spoke M. Venizelos at the outset, partly because the {137} Allies, who\r\ndid not want to have civil war in the rear of their armies, bade him to\r\nspeak so,[29] and partly because he wished to give his cause currency by\r\nstamping upon it the legend of loyalty.  He realized that for the present\r\nany suspicion that he wished to embark on a campaign against King\r\nConstantine would be fatal, and by declaring war only against the Bulgars\r\nhe hoped to entice patriotic citizens anxious to help their country\r\nwithout hurting their sovereign.  But when time proved the futility of\r\nthese tactics, the same M. Venizelos avowed that his programme was, first\r\nto consolidate his position in Macedonia by breaking down resistance\r\nwherever it might be encountered, and then, \"when we had gathered our\r\nforces, we meant to follow up our work, if need be by arms, on the\r\nremainder of Greek territory.\"  If he had not given an anti-dynastic\r\ncharacter to his enterprise, that, he naïvely explained, was \"because the\r\nEntente had been good enough to promise me their indispensable aid under\r\nthe express stipulation that the movement should _not_ be anti-dynastic.\"\r\nHowever, the error was not irreparable: \"After victory, grave internal\r\nquestions will have to be solved,\" he said.  \"King Constantine, who has\r\nstepped down from the throne of a constitutional king to become a mere\r\nparty chief, must accept the consequences of the defeat of his policy,\r\njust as every other defeated party chief.\" [30]\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Salonica sedition, though not solely revolutionary,\r\ninvolved a revolution within certain limits.  M. Venizelos was far too\r\nastute to countenance the republican chimeras cherished by some of his\r\nfollowers.  Republicanism, he knew well, found no favour in Greece and\r\ncould expect no support from England.  Therefore, with the monarchical\r\nprinciple he had no quarrel: his hostility was directed wholly against\r\nthe person of the reigning monarch.  A prince pliant to his hand would\r\nsuit M. Venizelos.  If he got the best of it, his avowed intention was to\r\ntreat King Constantine precisely as he had treated King Constantine's\r\nbrother in days gone by.\r\n\r\nWe now understand Prince George's earnestness in urging his brother, as\r\nlong ago as May, 1915, to run before {138} the gale: he spoke from bitter\r\nexperience of the Protecting Powers and their protégé.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that history repeats itself so accurately; and it is more\r\nseldom still that the historian has the means of tracing so surely a\r\nrebel's progress.  In most cases it is hard to decide whether the hero\r\nwas guided by events which he could not have foreseen, or whether he had\r\nfrom the first a clear and definite goal in view.  In the case of M.\r\nVenizelos this difficulty does not exist.  Each of his actions, as\r\nilluminated by his past, was a step to an end; and he has himself defined\r\nthat end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _The Times_, 18 Sept., 1916.\r\n\r\n[2] Carapanos to Greek Legations, Paris, London, Rome, Petrograd, 3/16\r\nSept., 1916.\r\n\r\n[3] _The Times, loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[4] Exchange Tel., Athens, 17 Sept., 1916.

Small wonder that the honest sailor's gorge rose\r\nat such proceedings: \"Could I associate myself with manoeuvres of this\r\nsort?\" he asks in disgust.  \"When German arms and bombs were seized in\r\nthe bag from Berlin to Christiania, when similar things were discovered\r\nat Bucharest, and were detected in the United States under Bernstorf's\r\nprotection, the Allies manifested their indignation.

Venizelos had unfurled the standard of rebellion in the true spirit\r\nof his temperament and traditions.  To him civil war had nothing\r\nrepulsive about it: it was a normal procedure--a ladder to power.\r\nNaturally, he persuaded others, and perhaps himself, that he acted\r\npurely with the patriotic intention of devoting to the public benefit\r\nthe power which, for that purpose only, it became his duty to usurp.\r\nMoved by the ambition to aggrandize Greece, he felt at liberty to use\r\nwhatever means might conduce to so desirable an end.  The sole question\r\nthat troubled him was, whether this old ladder would serve him as\r\nfaithfully as in the past.  And once again the answer depended on the\r\nattitude of the \"Protecting Powers.\"\r\n\r\nThose Powers had hitherto blundered in all their Balkan dealings with\r\ndepressing uniformity.  First came the mistake about Bulgaria.  The\r\nhate of the Greeks for the Bulgars was a psychological force which,\r\nproperly estimated and utilized, could without any difficulty have been\r\nmade to do our work for us.  But that force was never properly\r\nestimated by our diplomacy.  The Entente Governments, instead of\r\nenlisting it on their side, ranged it against them; thereby sacrificing\r\nServia and estranging Greece.  To that initial error was added a\r\nsecond.  Until the truth could no longer be ignored, the Allies\r\npersisted in the egregrious [Transcriber's note: egregious?] fallacy\r\nthat the popularity of King Constantine was as nothing compared with\r\nthe popularity of M. Venizelos--to our detriment.  \"Two years before,\"\r\nobserves Admiral Dartige du Fournet, \"all the Greeks were the friends\r\nof France; in October, 1916, two-thirds of them were her enemies.\"\r\nThat was the fact; and, according to the same witness--who described\r\nhimself, not without reason, as \"a Venizelist by profession\"--the cause\r\nwas this: \"The mass of the people of continental {140} Greece was\r\nhostile to the Chief of the Liberals.  When that mass saw that M.\r\nVenizelos started a sedition and that we supported him, it became\r\nplainly hostile to us.\" [1]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral mentions also German pressure, but he rightly regards it as\r\na subsidiary cause.  The Germans did little more than \"blow on the fire\r\nkindled by our own clumsiness and violences.\"  Baron Schenck, the\r\ndirector of the German propaganda at Athens, watched our coercion of\r\nKing Constantine with that apparent indignation and secret joy which\r\nthe faults of an enemy inspire, and when expelled by the Allies, said\r\nthat he did not mind going: the Allies could be trusted to carry on his\r\nmission.  They did.\r\n\r\nWhat their plan was will appear from their actions.  We cannot\r\npenetrate into the minds of men, and we cannot always believe their\r\nwords; but their actions are open to observation and speak more truly\r\nthan their lips.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he settled at Salonica, M. Venizelos applied to the Entente\r\nPowers for official recognition of his Provisional Government.  They\r\nrefused him this recognition: but instructed their Consuls to treat\r\nwith the Provisional Government \"on a _de facto_ footing\";[2] and,\r\nwhile pouring cold water upon him with one hand, with the other they\r\ngave him money.  This mode of action was the result of a compromise,\r\nachieved at the Boulogne Conference, between France and her partners.\r\nA feeble and inconsequent way of doing things, no doubt.  But to be\r\nconsequent and powerful, a partnership must be bottomed on some common\r\ninterest or sentiment; and such in the Greek question, as already\r\nexplained, did not exist.\r\n\r\nAt Athens the action of the Allies was less open to the criticism of\r\ntameness.\r\n\r\nAfter a life of three weeks passed in fruitless efforts to enter into\r\nrelations with the Entente Powers, even by proposing to discard the\r\nMinisters obnoxious to them, the Calogeropoulos Cabinet resigned (4\r\nOct.), and King Constantine, having exhausted his stock of politicians,\r\nsought a candidate for the Premiership in circles which, remote from\r\nparty intrigue, might have been thought immune from suspicion.\r\nProfessor Lambros, who accepted the {141} mandate (8 Oct.), was known\r\nas a grave savant, generally esteemed for his kindly nature as much as\r\nfor his intellectual eminence and administrative capacity.  But\r\nProfessor Lambros laboured under the universal disability of not being\r\na Venizelist.  Therefore, he was \"believed to be Germanophile,\" and it\r\nwas \"questionable whether his Cabinet will be recognized by the Entente\r\nPowers.\" [3]  However, in less than a week, he \"established contact\"\r\nwith their representatives.  It was \"contact\" in a sense of the term\r\nmore familiar to soldiers than to statesmen.\r\n\r\nOn 10 October Admiral Dartige de Fournet resumed his activities by\r\nlaunching on the Hellenic Government an Ultimatum.  Greece was\r\nsummoned, within twenty-four hours, to disarm her big ships, to hand\r\nover to him all her light ships intact, and to disarm all her coast\r\nbatteries, except three which were to be occupied by the Allies.  In\r\naddition, the port of the Piraeus, the railways, and the police were to\r\nbe placed under Allied control.\r\n\r\nThe demand for her Fleet, Greece was told, arose from uneasiness about\r\nthe safety of the Allied armada--a pretext that exposed itself: the\r\nGreek Fleet consisted of only five battleships dating from 1891-2,\r\nexcept one whose date was 1908; two cruisers, dating from 1911 and\r\n1914; and a microscopic light flotilla.  \"To see there a serious\r\ndanger, it would be puerile,\" says Admiral Dartige himself; and far\r\nfrom feeling elated at the success of the operation, he tells us that\r\nhe \"suffered at being constrained by events to use force against a\r\nneutral and weak nation.\"  But he had to do it: though not a matter to\r\nbe proud of, it was a precaution not altogether unjustifiable.  He\r\ncould, however, neither justify nor qualify the other measures.  They\r\ninvolved, he says, a high-handed encroachment on the internal affairs\r\nof the country--an abuse of power pure and simple: \"We admitted\r\nofficially the right of Greece to neutrality, and yet we laid hands\r\nupon part of her national life, even upon the secrets of the private\r\nlife of every Greek.  It was the execution of the plan which the\r\nadmirals assembled at Malta had repelled in March, 1916.  Well might\r\nthe Germanophiles point out that Germany did not act thus in Denmark,\r\nin Sweden, in Holland; that a victor would not have imposed {142}\r\nharder terms of armistice.\"  These measures were entirely the work of\r\nthe French Government: the French Admiral himself disapproved of them\r\nas much as did the Ministers of England and Russia.[4]\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic Government could not be deceived by pretexts which their\r\nvery authors despised.  But neither could it argue with persons\r\naccustomed to\r\n\r\n  \"Decide all controversies by\r\n  Infallible artillery,\r\n  And prove their doctrine orthodox\r\n  By apostolic blows and knocks.\"\r\n\r\nIt could only protest and submit.\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic people proved less discreet.  What could be the motive of\r\nsuch measures? they asked.  Were they intended to prevent or to provoke\r\ntroubles?  The answer lay under their very eyes.  From the moment when\r\nM. Venizelos left Athens, the Allies did everything they could to\r\nassist his partisans in following the Leader to Salonica.  Their\r\nwarships patrolled the coast picking up rebels, and giving them a free\r\npassage: even entertaining the more important among them as the\r\npersonal guests of the Commander-in-Chief on his flagship.  But now\r\nthey took the movement openly under their direction.  With an excess of\r\nzeal which the British Minister deplored and the French Admiral himself\r\ncondemned, the French Secret Service at Athens organized convoys of\r\ninsurgents which defiled through the streets of the capital escorted by\r\nFrench marines under French officers in uniform.[5]\r\n\r\nThe resentment of the Greeks was intense; but the consciousness of\r\nimpotence served as a curb on their emotions.  It is true that one day,\r\nas Allied aeroplanes flew over Athens, they were greeted with derisive\r\nshouts: \"Not here; to Berlin!\" another day, as a band of rebels were\r\nconvoyed through the principal streets by the French, the crowds gave\r\nvent to lively protests; and every day the newspapers told the\r\nchampions of Liberty and Justice what they thought of them so frankly\r\nthat the French Chief of the Police Control had to warn their editors\r\nto desist on pain of suspension.  But of active hostility, such as any\r\nwestern capital would have manifested in similar circumstances, there\r\nwas no sign at Athens.  The only impressive manifestations were\r\nmanifestations of {143} loyalty to the King, who set his subjects the\r\nexample of self-restraint.  At a review of the crews of the warships\r\ntaken by the French, he thanked them for their fidelity and expressed\r\nthe hope that they would soon be able to return to their vessels.\r\nAfter this quiet ceremony, bodies of citizens paraded the streets\r\ncarrying portraits of their sovereign.[6]\r\n\r\nHad there been no popular demonstrations at all, one can fancy M.\r\nVenizelos and the Allies pointing to that fact as proof of their\r\ncontention that the great majority of the people remained Venizelist.\r\nAs it was, they derived what profit they could from the opposite fact.\r\nThe various incidents were attributed by the Anglo-French and\r\nVenizelist journals to German intrigue.  The consolation which the King\r\nadministered to his sailors--men who had so brilliantly disappointed\r\nthe rebels' expectations by not deserting--was twisted into a defiance\r\nof the Entente.  The bodies of peaceful demonstrators were exaggerated\r\ninto crowds of rioters.  And so, \"in the interests of public order,\"\r\nAdmiral Dartige proceeded to land reinforcements for the police: 1,200\r\nbluejackets.  Some occupied the town hall at the Piraeus and the\r\nrailway stations; some went to the forts on the heights; others were\r\nposted about the harbour, or were told off to patrol the streets (16\r\nOct.), while a detachment was quartered at Athens itself, in the\r\nZappeion--a large exhibition building within a few hundred yards of the\r\nRoyal Palace.[7]\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances the diplomatic intercourse between the Entente\r\nand the new Greek Government went on.  M. Lambros declared that he\r\nintended to continue his predecessor's policy of friendly relations\r\nwith all the belligerents and of benevolent neutrality towards the\r\nAllies, dwelling on the fact that nearly everyone of his predecessors\r\nhad plainly stated Greece's willingness to co-operate with the Entente\r\non terms not contrary to her own interests, and recalling that the\r\nCalogeropoulos Ministry had set forth the conditions of co-operation,\r\nbut the Entente Governments had given no reply.  So the Premier spoke\r\nto the Entente representatives and asked that the coercive measures\r\nmight be brought to an end, {144} expressing the fear lest, should\r\nthese measures go beyond a certain limit, their acceptance by Greece\r\nmight become very difficult, and emphasizing the sorrow which the Greek\r\npeople felt at seeing its independence fettered.[8]\r\n\r\nEngland found this declaration satisfactory; but before answering it\r\ndefinitely, she must take counsel with her allies.[9]  France, by the\r\nmouth of M. Briand, pronounced the allusion to friendly relations with\r\nall the belligerents unfortunate: she was unable to understand how\r\nGreece could maintain friendly relations with Germany and even with\r\nBulgaria after the occupation of Eastern Macedonia.[10]  And so, having\r\ntaken counsel together, the Allies set forth their views in a tardy\r\nreply to King Constantine's last offer.  The gist of it was contained\r\nin this phrase: \"The Greek Government has several times since the\r\nbeginning of the War offered to come in on our side; but its offers,\r\nand particularly the last one, were accompanied by conditions which\r\nrendered them unacceptable.\"  The Entente Powers added that they did\r\nnot want Greece, unless she declared, on her own initiative, war\r\nagainst Bulgaria.  It was the only way to gain their confidence.[11]\r\n\r\nIn other words, Greece should take the field without any agreement, so\r\nthat she should have no claims either to adequate support during the\r\nwar or to compensations at the conclusion of peace: nay, it was even\r\nhoped in Paris and London that Bulgaria might yet be seduced from the\r\nCentral Powers, and in that case not only would Greece gain nothing in\r\nThrace, but might very likely lose a portion of Macedonia.[12]  It was\r\nthe old story--to which King Constantine could never listen.  He would\r\nsuffer anything rather than plunge his country into war without even an\r\nassurance of its territorial integrity.  When at this juncture a\r\nwell-intentioned adviser warned him that his policy might cost him his\r\nthrone, he answered promptly: \"I do not care about my throne.  I only\r\nthink of Greece.\" [13]\r\n\r\n{145}\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there was little he would not do to remove those\r\nfears and suspicions which were perpetually pleaded as reasons for\r\ncoercion.  The surrender of the Fleet had allayed once for all the\r\nAllies' uneasiness about their forces at sea.  There remained their\r\nuneasiness about their forces on land.  In spite of his repeated\r\ndeclarations that under no circumstances would Greece take up a hostile\r\nattitude, the King was credited with a treacherous design--to mass in\r\nThessaly 80,000 men, lay up munitions and provisions, wait until the\r\nAllied Army should march on Monastir, and then attack it from\r\nbehind.[14]  After reading M. Venizelos's own avowal of his intention\r\nto follow up the conversion of Macedonia with an attack on the rest of\r\nGreece, particularly Thessaly,[15] one hardly needs to be told at whom\r\nKing Constantine's precautions were aimed.\r\n\r\nYet, wishing to prove his good faith in a practical manner, the King\r\ncalled the British Minister and offered to reduce his army to less than\r\nhalf by disbanding about 35,000 men and to withdraw certain units from\r\nThessaly.  The British Minister, delighted by this spontaneous offer,\r\nthanked the King, expressing the hope that his action would be greatly\r\nappreciated, that all mistrust would vanish, and that the Powers would\r\nmoderate their coercions.  With a remark from the King, that the one\r\nthing he would not tolerate was a descent of rebels on Thessaly and the\r\nrest of Old Greece, and that he would attack them if they appeared, Sir\r\nFrancis Elliot fully concurred.\r\n\r\nInstead of the return which the King expected to this spontaneous proof\r\nof his sincerity, he received (20 October) an intimation that the\r\nPowers not only demanded what he had already granted, but in addition\r\nthings which he could not possibly grant--the internment of the small\r\nremnant of his army in the Peloponnesus and a surrender of arms and war\r\nmaterial equivalent to a complete disarmament.  These measures, while\r\nexceeding all requirements for the security of the Allies, put the\r\nsecurity of Greece in danger by leaving her a prey to revolutionary\r\nagitation.  The King, therefore, begged the Powers not {146} to insist\r\non concessions which neither could he make nor would his people let him\r\nmake.[16]\r\n\r\nNothing, indeed, was better calculated to excite to the highest degree\r\nthe passions fermenting against the Allies than an insistence on total\r\ndisarmament at a moment when M. Venizelos at Salonica and his partisans\r\nat Athens were arming.  Fortunately a mediator appeared in the person\r\nof M. Benazet, a French Deputy and Reporter of the War Budget, who was\r\npassing through Athens on his way to Salonica to inspect the sanitary\r\ncondition of the Army.  His connexions had brought him into touch with\r\nthe most influential leaders of both Greek parties; and with the\r\nsanction of M. Briand, procured through M. Guillemin, who, himself no\r\nlonger received at Court, saw an advantage in reaching it by proxy, he\r\nundertook to negotiate an amicable arrangement between King Constantine\r\nand the Entente.\r\n\r\nM. Benazet's idea was to obtain from the King not only tangible pledges\r\nwhich would eliminate all possibility of danger from the Allies' path,\r\nbut also positive reinforcements for them in arms and men; and as a\r\nprice he was prepared to guarantee to Old Greece her neutrality, her\r\nliberty in the management of her internal affairs, and her immunity\r\nfrom aggression on the part of M. Venizelos.  Young, eloquent, and\r\nrefined, the spokesman brought into an environment corrupted by\r\ndiplomatic chicanery a breath of candour.  His manner inspired and\r\nevoked confidence.  The King readily agreed, besides the reduction\r\nwhich he had already offered, to transfer the remainder of his army to\r\nthe Peloponnesus, to hand over to the Allies a considerable stock of\r\nguns, rifles, and other war material, and to allow all men who were\r\nreleased from their military obligations, and all officers who first\r\nresigned their commissions, to volunteer for service in Macedonia.  M.\r\nBenazet, on his part, made himself guarantor for the French Government\r\nas to the pledges which the King required in exchange.[17]\r\n\r\nThis agreement met, at least in appearance, with the approval of M.\r\nBriand, who sent a telegram of congratulations {127} to M. Benazet,[18]\r\nand with that of M. Guillemin, who was at last received by the King.\r\nBoth the French Premier and his representative at Athens expressed\r\nthemselves enchanted with the new turn of affairs, and even the\r\nfire-breathing Head of the French Secret Service declared that the\r\nresult of the negotiation surpassed all hopes.  As to Admiral Dartige,\r\nhe could not but rejoice at an arrangement so consonant with his own\r\nideas.[19]  Thus all outstanding differences seemed happily settled,\r\nand the removal of mutual misunderstandings was celebrated by inspired\r\npens in Paris and London.[20]\r\n\r\nThe only discordant note was struck by the Venizelist Press, which made\r\nno attempt to conceal its disappointment.  And suddenly, just as the\r\nwithdrawal of the royal troops from the north was about to begin, the\r\ntroops of the Provisional Government attacked Katerini on the southern\r\nfrontier of Macedonia.  M. Venizelos had dropped the pose that his\r\nmovement was directed solely against the Bulgars: he marched on Old\r\nGreece.  Did he by this move try to force the hand of the Allies, as\r\nformerly by bringing them to Salonica he had tried to force the hand of\r\nthe King?   And was he encouraged in this move by those who were\r\nsecretly opposed to an accommodation with the King?  Admiral Dartige\r\ndid not know.  What he did know was that this _coup de force_ was\r\ndesigned to compromise the arrangement with Athens; and as he could\r\nneither play nor appear to play a double game, he immediately\r\ntelegraphed to Salonica demanding the retreat of the Venizelists.  At\r\nthe same time the King informed the French and British Ministers that\r\nhe could not withdraw his troops from Thessaly until all danger was\r\nremoved, and asked them to do everything that depended on them to\r\nremedy this state of things.  Whereupon General Roques, the French\r\nMinister of War then at Salonica, disavowed the Venizelist action, and\r\nto prevent similar exploits in future decided to create a neutral zone\r\nunder French occupation and administration.  The Athens Government was\r\nnot pleased to see part of its territory passing into French hands;\r\nbut, after some demur, bowed to the decision.[21]\r\n\r\n{148}\r\n\r\nNot so the Salonica Government.  M. Venizelos keenly resented this\r\nbarrier to his impetuosity.  The neutral zone, he complained, by\r\nblocking off his access to Thessaly, forbade all extension of his\r\nmovement and prevented him from \"carrying with him three-fifths of\r\nGreece and levying important contingents such as would have made him\r\nthe absolute master of the country.\" [22]  But the Allies were no\r\nlonger to be deluded.  They had discovered that \"the mass of the people\r\nof continental Greece was hostile to the Chief of the Liberals.\"  An\r\nextension of his movement could only be effected by overwhelming force,\r\nand as M. Venizelos had neither the men nor the arms required for the\r\nenterprise, the Allies would have to provide both.  In other words,\r\ncivil war in the rear of their armies would not only jeopardise their\r\nsecurity but entangle them in a campaign for the conquest of Greece: a\r\nthing which they could not afford to do even to oblige M. Venizelos.\r\nThey preferred a subtler and safer, if slower, way to the success of\r\ntheir common cause.\r\n\r\nBaulked in his design on continental Greece, M. Venizelos demanded from\r\nAdmiral Dartige the light flotilla in order to promote his cause in the\r\nislands.  But here, also, he met with a check.  The Admiral had a\r\ndifferent use for those vessels in view.  Many months back he felt the\r\nwant of patrol and torpedo-boats to cope with the growing submarine\r\nperil, and had suggested asking Greece for the cession of her light\r\nflotilla.  The matter was postponed in the expectation that the vessels\r\nwould go over to the Allies spontaneously as a result of the Venizelist\r\nmovement, and on this expectation being disappointed they were, as we\r\nhave seen, sequestered under the pretence of security for the Allied\r\narmada.  Another excuse was needed for their appropriation; and it came\r\nin the nick of time: two Greek steamers at that moment struck mines,\r\npresumably sown by an enemy submarine, in the Gulf of Athens.  With the\r\npromptitude that comes of practice, Admiral Dartige announced to the\r\nHellenic Government his decision to employ, at a valuation, its light\r\nflotilla in the submarine {149} warfare, and to use the Salamis arsenal\r\nfor repairs (3 November.)[23]\r\n\r\nM. Lambros replied that compliance with the Admiral's request involved\r\na breach of International Law, which forbade the sale of naval units by\r\na neutral State to a belligerent, as well as a breach of a Greek law\r\nwhich forbade the alienation of ships possessing military value.\r\nBesides, public opinion would never endure to see the country stripped\r\nof its naval means of defence and exposed to possible aggression.  He\r\nwas, therefore, regretfully obliged to refuse the Hellenic Government's\r\nconsent.[24]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral could not let a refusal stand in his way: \"It would be\r\nunpardonable,\" he wrote in answer, \"to leave these vessels unutilized\r\nwhilst German submarines, heedless of the neutrality of Greece, came\r\nand sank her merchant ships in her waters, thus stopping maritime\r\ntraffic and seriously prejudicing the life of the country.\" [25]\r\n\r\nHaving got over these little formalities, he hoisted the French flag on\r\nthe vessels and seized the arsenal (7 November).  The Hellenic\r\nGovernment's protest against this fresh outrage,[26] naturally, had no\r\neffect.  Only the British Minister made it clear that the act was\r\nexclusively the work of France.[27]\r\n\r\nNothing done by one group of belligerents, needless to say, escaped the\r\nattention of the other; and the representatives of the enemy Powers,\r\nbesides fulminating against a step which, \"in flagrant contravention of\r\nthe principles of neutrality came to augment the armed forces of their\r\nadversaries,\" improved the occasion by reciting all the proofs of \"a\r\nbenevolent neutrality without parallel,\" which Greece had been giving\r\nthose adversaries since the beginning of the War: the free passage of\r\nmunitions and provisions for Servia; the facilities accorded to Entente\r\nshipping; the toleration of recruiting bureaux and wireless stations in\r\nGreek territory; the use of isles and ports as naval bases.  Then the\r\nlanding of the Allies in Macedonia {150} had inaugurated a period of\r\ncontinuous violations of neutrality and the establishment of a regime\r\nof terror towards them: their Consuls were arrested, members of their\r\nLegations were assaulted, great numbers of their nationals were led\r\ninto captivity or driven into exile, their merchant ships were seized,\r\nand the Ministers themselves were deprived of all means of\r\ncommunicating with their Governments.  Last of all came the\r\ninstallation of Allied troops in Athens itself and the sequestration of\r\nthe Greek navy, now transformed into a definite cession;  and,\r\naccording to trustworthy intelligence, the Entente Powers meant to\r\nexact shortly the disarmament of the Greek army also.  They ended with\r\na hint that the indulgence of their Governments might reach its\r\nlimit.[28]\r\n\r\nA more painful position for a free people and its rulers could not be\r\nimagined.  But King Constantine comforted himself with the thought that\r\nthe \"pledges of friendship\" exacted from him by the Allies would be\r\nfollowed by corresponding pledges from them.  His negotiation with M.\r\nBenazet had received its finishing touches in the evening of 7\r\nNovember: the Entente Powers would present to the Greek Government a\r\nNote setting forth their demands in the form of a \"Summons,\" the terms\r\nof which were, word for word, agreed upon between the two parties.  By\r\nthis document the Allies bound themselves \"to repeal the coercive\r\nmeasures taken up to now and never to tolerate that armed Greek bodies\r\nwhich had declared to have as their sole aim a struggle for the\r\nvindication of national ideas should turn aside from that aim in order\r\nto engage in acts of sedition.\" [29]\r\n\r\nThis clause formed the corner-stone of the whole pact.  \"It is clear,\"\r\ntelegraphs M. Benazet to Paris, \"that some sort of compensation is\r\nadmitted in principle,\"--for very good reasons: \"The King's sole\r\nfear--and a very intelligible one--is lest his own arms should be\r\nhanded over to Greeks who would use them to march on Athens and\r\noverthrow his dynasty.\"  Moreover, without such guarantees it will be\r\nimpossible for the King and his Premier \"to make disarmament acceptable\r\nby the Royalist Party, {151} which constitutes the great majority of\r\nthe nation.\"  He added that neither the King nor his Premier was\r\nunaware of the hostility with which these efforts for conciliation were\r\nviewed by certain personalities: but both were resolved to show the\r\ngreatest patience until the agreement had produced all its effects.\r\nThe negotiator himself, equally aware of the hostile forces at work,\r\nleft Athens with a heart full of misgivings.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Du Fournet, pp. 132, 171.\r\n\r\n[2] The _New Europe_, 29 March, 1917; _The Times_, 17 Oct., 1916.\r\n\r\n[3] _The Times_, dispatch from Athens, 8 Oct., 1916.\r\n\r\n[4] Du Fournet, pp. 138-9, 141-3.\r\n\r\n[5] Du Fournet, pp. 133-5, 146.\r\n\r\n[6] _The Times_, dispatch from Athens, 16 Oct., 1916.\r\n\r\n[7] Du Fournet, pp. 146-8.\r\n\r\n[8] Zalocostas to Greek Legations, Paris, London, Rome, Petrograd, 3/16\r\nOct., 1916.\r\n\r\n[9] Gennadius, London, 6/19 Oct., 1916.\r\n\r\n[10] Romanos, Paris, 7/20 Oct., 1916.\r\n\r\n[11] Gennadius, London, 10/23 Oct., 1916.\r\n\r\n[12] Romanos, Paris, 26 Aug./8 Sept., 1916; Cp.

The claim was presented\r\nas \"compensation\" for the war material abandoned to the Germano-Bulgars\r\nin Cavalla: about guarantees not a word.[1]\r\n\r\nThe King called the Admiral (19 November) and, with perfect courtesy, yet\r\nwith a visible change in his attitude, expressed his astonishment at so\r\nunexpected a version of the \"Summons\" agreed upon.  The Admiral had no\r\nexplanation to give to the King.  But to us he explains everything.  The\r\nFrench Minister at Athens was hostile to M. Benazet's amicable\r\narrangement, and repudiated his pledges, notably the one concerning the\r\nspread of sedition.  \"We are not made to defend kings against their\r\npeoples,\" he said.  The French Government likewise completely ignored the\r\nagreement, and the French Minister of War had dictated the lines on which\r\nthe claim was drafted.  Admiral Dartige's comments on this volte-face are\r\ninteresting: \"Without wanting to give the Greek Government the two\r\nguarantees which it demanded, they claimed from it the fulfilment of the\r\nengagements of which those guarantees were the counter-part.  It was a\r\ntruly draconian and unexpected pretension,\" he says, and to base that\r\npretension on the Cavalla affair was \"to misconstrue in part the reality\r\nof facts.\" [2]\r\n\r\nWhy, then, was M. Benazet encouraged to negotiate?  Probably there were\r\nin France moderate elements strong enough to make it necessary to throw a\r\nsop to them.  But the extremists were the stronger party; and when it\r\ncame {153} to a decision they carried the day.  However, be the motive of\r\nthe mission what it may, its repudiation meant that the old policy still\r\nheld the field.  It was an essential part of that policy not to allow\r\nGreece any attitude other than that of a belligerent.  So, while the\r\nEntente Cabinets continued disclaiming all desire to drag an unwilling\r\ncountry into war and declaring that the only thing they asked for was the\r\nobservance of a benevolent neutrality, the practical exponents of their\r\npolicy on the spot continued to take steps in which Greece could\r\nacquiesce only if she contemplated a rupture with the Central Powers.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day (19 November) Admiral Dartige, at the\r\ninstance of the Entente Ministers, ordered their German, Austrian,\r\nTurkish, and Bulgarian colleagues to quit the country in three days.[3]\r\nThe Hellenic Government, to whom the Admiral communicated his decree,\r\nprotested against this blow at the representatives of Powers with whom\r\nGreece, in virtue of her neutrality recognized by the Entente, was on\r\nterms of friendship and peace; pointing out that the step was a breach\r\nnot only of the inviolability assured to diplomats by International Law,\r\nbut also of a formal promise given by the French and British Ministers to\r\nPremier Zaimis when the Allied Fleet arrived at the Piraeus--viz. that\r\nthe missions of the Powers at war with the Entente had absolutely nothing\r\nto fear.  It asked that the decision might be revoked.[4]\r\n\r\nOur representatives experienced no difficulty in disposing of this\r\nprotest.  The promise given was merely \"an act of spontaneous\r\ncourtesy\"--it had not \"any character of a definite, irrevocable\r\nengagement\"--\"and could not, in any case, have for effect to guarantee\r\nthe Ministers of countries at war with the Entente against the\r\nconsequences of hostile acts foreign to their diplomatic functions and\r\ncontrary to the neutrality of Greece\"--acts of espionage and intrigue\r\nwhich, as a matter of fact, form an integral part of a diplomat's\r\nfunctions.  They did not, therefore, \"deem it possible to ask Admiral\r\nDartige du Fournet to revoke the decision taken by him in virtue of the\r\npowers with which he was invested.\" [5]\r\n\r\n{154}\r\n\r\nThus the Ministers of Germany, Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria were bundled\r\noff (22 November), protesting vigorously \"against the outrages committed\r\non four diplomatic representatives in neutral territory,\" characterising\r\nthe things which took place at Athens as \"beyond all comment,\" and\r\nwondering \"whether a firmer attitude would not have spared the country\r\nthese affronts on its sovereignty.\" [6]\r\n\r\nThis unprecedented measure added still further to the irritation of the\r\nGreeks, and the manner in which it was executed--without even a show of\r\nthe courtesies prescribed between diplomats by the tradition of\r\ncenturies--shocked the very man who acted as the executioner.  Not for\r\nthe first time had Admiral Dartige been made to serve ends which he did\r\nnot understand, by means which he did not approve, in association with\r\npersons whom he could not respect.  But the worst was yet to come.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Premier delivered his answer to the Admiral's claim on 22\r\nNovember.  In that answer M. Lambros showed that the Allies had already\r\n\"compensated themselves\" amply: the war material which they had\r\nappropriated--not to mention the light flotilla--being superior both in\r\nquantity and in quality to anything that had been abandoned to their\r\nenemies.  Then he went on to state that the surrender of any more\r\nmaterial would be equivalent to a departure from neutrality; and the\r\nCentral Powers, which had already protested against the light flotilla's\r\npassing into the hands of the Entente, would so regard it.  Lastly,\r\npublic opinion would never tolerate that Greece should so denude herself\r\nof arms as to be unable to defend herself in case of need.  For all these\r\nreasons, the Hellenic Government categorically refused the Admiral's\r\nclaim.[7]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral felt keenly the iniquity of compelling a neutral country to\r\ngive up, without conditions, the arms which constituted its safeguard at\r\nonce against invasion and against insurrection.  But what could he do?\r\nHe had his orders, and it was his duty to carry them out as soon as\r\npossible.[8]  So, making use of the plenary authority {155} thrust upon\r\nhim, he retorted (24 Nov.) with an Ultimatum: ten mountain batteries\r\nshould be handed over to him by 1 December at the latest, and the\r\nremainder by 15 December.  Failing obedience to his command, suitable\r\nsteps would be taken on 1 December to enforce it.  He declined to believe\r\nthat \"the public opinion of a country so enlightened as Greece could\r\nregard as intolerable the idea of handing over to Powers towards whom it\r\nprofessed a benevolent neutrality a stock of arms and munitions destined\r\nfor the liberation of territory saturated with the noblest Greek blood:\r\ntheir place was, not at the bottom of magazines, but at the front.\" [9]\r\n\r\nThere is always a limit beyond which human intelligence cannot be\r\ninsulted with success, or human patience tried with impunity.  France had\r\nlong since overstepped that limit.  Across all the self-contradictory\r\nsubtleties of her statesmen, the Greeks, thanks to the self-revealing\r\nacts of her soldiers, sailors, and agents, had discerned the real object\r\nof her diplomacy: to force upon them M.  Venizelos and to rule them\r\nthrough him: she had already helped M.  Venizelos to establish his sway\r\nover New Greece, and was now attempting to extend it over Old Greece.\r\nThe creation of a \"neutral zone\" did not blind them: they had only too\r\nmuch reason to know what neutrality meant in the vocabulary of the\r\nAllies: they had taken the King's ships: all that remained was to take\r\nhis arms and to hand them over to their protégé.  Such was the true\r\nsignificance of the fresh \"pledges of friendship\" claimed from them; and\r\nthe claim aroused unanimous indignation: we will not submit to any\r\nfurther robbery, they cried.  What have we gained by submission so far?\r\nOur conciliatory attitude towards the Allies and our efforts for a\r\nfriendly settlement of the questions daily raised by them are regarded as\r\nsigns of fear and rewarded accordingly: their arrogance increases with\r\nour compliance.  No more compliance.  The indignation was, naturally,\r\nmost pronounced in military circles, and the officers of the Athens\r\ngarrison took a vow to lay down their lives in defence of the King's and\r\ncountry's honour.\r\n\r\nBefore pushing matters to extremes, Admiral Dartige called on the King\r\n(27 Nov.) and tried to intimidate him {156} by telling him that the\r\nAllied armada had Greece at its mercy, and that by simply cutting off the\r\nsupplies of corn and coal it could break all resistance.  The King agreed\r\nthat the Allies possessed all-powerful means of persuasion, but did not\r\nseem as much impressed as was expected.  He reminded the Admiral that he\r\nhad done everything possible to prove his goodwill by spontaneously\r\nreducing his active army.  He could do no more: the people and the army\r\nwere so excited over this last demand that to make them accept it was\r\nbeyond his power.  The measure might be accepted, if the quantity claimed\r\nwas lessened: he would take steps in that sense with the French\r\nGovernment through his brother, Prince George.  It was clear that the\r\nKing's change of tone arose from the absence of the guarantees which he\r\nhad asked and hoped for: not having received those guarantees he\r\nconsidered himself released from the promises he had given.  The Admiral\r\nunderstood the position perfectly, and in his heart did not blame the\r\nKing for rejecting the \"draconian pretension\" that he should disarm while\r\nnot secure that his arms would not be used against himself.  But he had\r\nhis orders and could only say that he meant to carry them out: on Friday\r\nmorning, 1 December, he would impose the will of the Entente Governments.\r\nHe still thought that the King would not resist \"energetic pressure.\" [10]\r\n\r\nProportionate to their loyalty was the Athenians' animosity against the\r\nVenizelists in their midst, who had long been plotting and arming in\r\nconjunction with the French, and preparing for one of those _coups_ for\r\nwhich Paris had set the fashion during a hundred years.  Admiral Dartige\r\nhad expressed his concern for these unhappy patriots to the King at his\r\nlast interview, and on going from the Palace to the French Legation he\r\nfound there the British Minister greatly alarmed because several\r\nimportant Venizelists had prayed him to obtain for them the Admiral's\r\nprotection; but no sooner had the Admiral acted on their prayer, than the\r\npanic-stricken patriots implored him not to protect them, lest the\r\nmeasures taken for their safety should cause their destruction.[11]\r\nHowever, next day, the King assured the Admiral through his Marshal of\r\nthe Court, that neither the persons nor the {157} property of the\r\nVenizelists should suffer, on condition that neither the Entente Powers'\r\ndetectives nor the detachments he was going to land indulged in arrests,\r\ndeportations, or disappearances of Greek subjects, and that the\r\nVenizelists themselves abstained from acts calculated to provoke\r\nreprisals.[12]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things created by the Admiral's Ultimatum.  What\r\nwould happen when the time-limit expired?  The inhabitants of Athens\r\ndebated this question anxiously, and their anxiety was deepened by the\r\nsight of many disquieting symptoms: day after day Allied aeroplanes and\r\nautomobiles carried out reconnaissances over the capital, paying special\r\nattention to the Royal Palace, intensifying the irritation of civilians\r\nand soldiers, and stiffening their resolution to resist, come what might.\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic Government endeavoured to ward off the storm by\r\nremonstrating with the Governments of the Entente direct.  As the\r\nAdmiral's claim was presented exclusively in the name of France, it began\r\nwith Paris.  The answer was that King Constantine had promised to the\r\nFrench Government the war material demanded, and the French Government\r\nhad promised in exchange to relax the coercive measures: since the Greek\r\nGovernment declared that it could not fulfil this promise, it must suffer\r\nthe consequences.  Paris, in Admiral Dartige's words, \"wanted to reap the\r\nfruit of the Benazet negotiation without paying the price agreed to.\"\r\n[13]  Whatever London may have thought of this manoeuvre, it said that\r\nthe British Government was in full knowledge of the French Admiral's\r\nsteps and supported them.  Petrograd was equally cognizant of the affair,\r\nand, as it was a question of military measures with which Russia could\r\nnot interfere, advised Greece to comply, assuring her that \"what was done\r\nwas for her good.\" [14]\r\n\r\nAs a last resource, Greece appealed to neutral countries, describing the\r\ncondition in which she had long found herself, because she was not strong\r\nenough to impose respect for her neutrality, and protesting against this\r\nlatest demand as most injurious to her honour and {158} subversive of all\r\nher rights.[15]  The solicitation remained fruitless.  The great American\r\nRepublic was too intimately connected with France and England to\r\nintervene on behalf of Greece.  The small states knew too well from their\r\nown experience how frail are the foundations upon which rest the honour\r\nand the rights of weak neutrals in a world war.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, firm in the knowledge that he had the vast majority of the\r\nnation behind him, M. Lambros, on 30 November, by a final letter,\r\ndeclared to the French Admiral that his claim was utterly unacceptable.\r\n\"I do not wish to believe,\" he concluded, \"that, after examining in a\r\nspirit of goodwill and equity the reasons which render it impossible for\r\nthe Greek people and its Government to give you satisfaction, you will\r\nproceed to measures which would be incompatible with the traditional\r\nfriendship between France and Greece, and which the people would justly\r\nregard as hostile acts.\" [16]\r\n\r\nIn face of Greece's unequivocal determination not to yield, the Admiral\r\nwould have been well advised to insist with his Government on an amicable\r\naccommodation.  He had not the means of carrying out his threats.  It is\r\ntrue, his ships dominated the sea and their guns the capital; but, since\r\nthe Greeks were determined to stand another blockade and to risk the\r\nbombardment of their capital rather than surrender their arms, how could\r\nhe take them without an army?  The problem had not escaped the worthy\r\nsailor.  So grave a claim, he tells us, could not be enforced without\r\nwar; and the Entente Powers were not thinking of going to war with\r\nGreece.  Therefore, he had hit on the expedient of giving to his action\r\nthe name and, so far as the nature of the thing permitted, the character\r\nof a \"pacific demonstration.\"  Not one shot would be fired except in\r\nself-defence: the troops would not seek to seize the material by\r\nviolence: they would simply occupy certain points of vantage until they\r\nreceived satisfaction.  He admits that his confidence in the success of\r\nthese tactics, since his last interview with the King, had suffered some\r\ndiminution.  But he still {159} nourished a hope--based on the fact \"that\r\nthe Athens Government had always hitherto ended by bowing to our will.\"\r\n[17]  He overlooked the inflamed minds of the people.\r\n\r\nBefore break of day, on 1 December, a body of marines some 3,000 weak\r\nlanded at the Piraeus with machine-guns and marched on Athens in three\r\ncolumns, driving back the Greek patrols, which retired at their approach,\r\nand occupied some of the strategic positions aimed at without\r\nencountering any resistance.  So far the pacific demonstration lived up\r\nto its name.  Both sides conformed to their respective orders, which were\r\nto avoid all provocation, and on no account to fire first.  But for all\r\nthat the situation teemed with the elements of an explosion.  Admiral\r\nDartige, on landing, had noted the faces of the people: sullen and\r\ndefiant, they faithfully reflected the anger which seethed in their\r\nhearts.  And, about 11 o'clock, at one point the smouldering embers burst\r\ninto flame.  How, it is not known: as usually happens in such cases, each\r\nside accused the other of beginning.  Once begun, the fight spread along\r\nthe whole line to the French headquarters in the Zappeion.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of shots, King Constantine caused a telephone message to be\r\nsent through the French Legation to the French flagship, asking for\r\nAdmiral Dartige, to beg him to stop the bloodshed.  The officer at the\r\nother end of the wire hesitated to disclose the Admiral's whereabouts,\r\nfearing a trap; but at last he replied that his Chief had gone to the\r\nZappeion, where indeed he was found shut up.  A parley between that\r\nbuilding and the Palace led to an armistice, during which negotiations\r\nfor a peace were initiated by the Entente Ministers.  In the middle of\r\nthese, fighting broke out afresh; according to the Royalists, through the\r\naction of the Venizelists who, desirous to profit by the foreign invasion\r\nin order to promote a domestic revolution, opened rifle fire from the\r\nwindows, balconies, and roofs of certain houses upon the royal troops\r\npatrolling the streets: a statement more than probable, seeing that arms\r\nhad long been stored in Venizelist houses with a view to such an\r\nenterprise.  At the same time, Admiral Dartige, who seems to have\r\ncompletely lost his head, {160} considering the armistice at an end,\r\nordered the warships to start a bombardment.\r\n\r\nWhile shells fell upon the outlying quarters of the town, and even into\r\nthe courtyard of the Royal Palace itself, forcing the Queen to put her\r\nchildren in the cellar, the Entente Ministers arrived to conclude the\r\ntreaty:\r\n\r\n\"Are these your arguments, gentlemen?\" asked the King, as he received\r\nthem.  Amid the general consternation, he alone maintained his calmness.\r\n\r\nThe conference went on to the accompaniment of whistling and bursting\r\nshells, and at 7 o'clock ended in an agreement, whereby Admiral Dartige\r\nconsented to stop hostilities and accept the King's offer of six mountain\r\nbatteries, in lieu of the ten he had demanded; the Entente Ministers\r\nundertaking to recommend to their Governments the abandonment of his\r\nother demands.\r\n\r\nThere ensued an exchange of prisoners, and the retreat of the Allies to\r\ntheir ships during the night, followed next day by the detachment\r\nquartered at the Zappeion, and all the controllers of police, posts,\r\ntelegraphs, telephones, and railways.  Many of the ruffians in the pay of\r\nthe Franco-British Secret Services anticipated this evacuation by\r\nslipping out of the capital which they had terrorized for nearly a year.\r\n\r\nAnd so the pacific demonstration was over, having cost the Greeks 4\r\nofficers and 26 men killed, and 4 officers and 51 men wounded.  The\r\nAllied casualties were 60 killed, including 6 officers, and 167 wounded.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, no epithet was less applicable to the affair than that of\r\n\"Athenian Vespers,\" with which the Parisian press christened it.  Admiral\r\nDartige protests indignantly against the grotesque exaggerations of his\r\nimaginative compatriots.  Apart from the tragic features natural to a\r\npacific demonstration, he declares that the whole drama passed off as\r\npleasantly as a drama could.  Not a single Allied subject was\r\nill-treated.  Not one shot was fired on the Legations of the Entente\r\nPowers, whose Ministers and nationals, in the midst of it all, incurred\r\nonly such danger as came from their own shells--shells showered upon an\r\nopen town.  Even the French bluejackets, who had long been a thorn in the\r\nvery heart of Athens, were conducted back to their proper place under a\r\nGreek escort, ingloriously {161} but safely.  A like spirit, to a still\r\nhigher degree, marked the treatment in Greek hospitals of the Allies'\r\nwounded, whose rapid recovery, says the Admiral, testified to the care\r\nwhich they received.  \"We assisted in a civil war: the Royalists struck\r\nin our marines the protectors of their political enemies.\" [18]\r\n\r\nIt was upon those enemies that Royalist wrath satiated itself.  On 2\r\nDecember, veritable battles took place in many parts of Athens; suspect\r\nhouses, hotels, offices, and shops being assailed and defended with\r\nmurderous fury.  The house of M. Venizelos, as was fitting, formed the\r\ncentre of the conflict.  Twenty Cretan stalwarts had barricaded\r\nthemselves in it and held out until machine-guns persuaded them to\r\nsurrender.  Within was discovered a small arsenal of rifles, revolvers,\r\nhand-grenades, dynamite cartridges, fuses: among them a bundle of weapons\r\nstill wrapped in the French canvas in which it had arrived.  Tell-tale\r\narticles of a similar nature were discovered on the premises of other\r\nconspirators, who were led off to prison, pursued by crowds hooting,\r\ncursing, spitting at them, so that their escorts had the greatest\r\ndifficulty in saving them from being lynched.  Although not comparable to\r\nparallel scenes witnessed by many a Western city under analogous\r\ncircumstances, the event was an exhibition of human savagery sufficiently\r\nugly in itself: it did not require the legends of massacre and torture\r\nwith which it was embellished by pious journalists anxious to excite in\r\nthe Allied publics sympathy for persons whom the Allies' own advance had\r\ninstigated to violence and their precipitate retreat had exposed to a not\r\nunmerited vengeance.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Du Fournet, pp. 188-9.\r\n\r\n[2] Du Fournet, pp. 151, 179-80, 182-3, 190-1.\r\n\r\n[3] Du Fournet, pp. 195-7.\r\n\r\n[4] Zalocostas to the Entente Legations, Athens, 7/20 Nov, 1916.\r\n\r\n[5] Guillemin, Elliot, Bosdani, Demidoff, Athens, 8/21 Nov., 1916.\r\n\r\n[6] Mirbach, Szilassy, Passaroff, Ghalib Kemaly, Athens, 8/21 Nov., 1916.\r\n\r\n[7] Lambros to Dartige du Fournet, Athens, 9/22 Nov., 1916.

But echoes of the storm\r\ncontinued reverberating in Paris and London.  In Paris it was asserted,\r\nand in London repeated, that the French Admiral had fallen into a\r\ncunningly laid trap: King Constantine had promised to hand over his war\r\nmaterial; but when the Allies landed to receive it, he caused them to\r\nbe treacherously attacked and murdered.[1]  On the strength of this\r\nassertion, the Entente newspapers demanded punishment swift and\r\ndrastic: a prince who broke faith deserved no pity.  His offer of six\r\nbatteries was \"an atonement\" both cynical and inadequate for the\r\n\"ambush\" by which French and English blood had been spilt.  Similarly\r\nthe internecine strife of 2 December and the subsequent proceedings\r\nagainst the Venizelists were depicted as a wanton hunt of harmless and\r\nlaw-abiding citizens.  Day by day the stream of calumny, assiduously\r\nfed from the fountain-head at Salonica, grew in volume and virulence;\r\nand King Constantine was branded with every opprobrious epithet of\r\nliar, traitor, and assassin.\r\n\r\nThese were weapons against which the King of Greece and his Government\r\nhad nothing to oppose.  They tried to explain the true nature of the\r\nabortive Benazet negotiation, showing that, if there was any breach of\r\nfaith, it was not on their part; they denounced the falsehoods and the\r\nexaggerations relating to the suppression of the seditious outbreak;\r\nthey asked that a mixed Commission should be appointed to conduct an\r\nimpartial inquiry on the spot while the events were still fresh and\r\nevidence abundant.  The French and British Press Censors took care that\r\nnot a whisper of their defence should reach the French and British\r\npublics.[2]  Frenchmen and Englishmen {163} might hear of M.\r\nVenizelos's deeds through his friends.  They were allowed to hear of\r\nthe King's only through his enemies.  It was clear that the policy\r\nwhich had prompted the disastrous enterprise of 1 December had not yet\r\nworked itself out to its full issue.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dartige could not very well endorse the breach of faith legend.\r\nHe knew that the engagement about the delivery of arms was reciprocal,\r\nand that, as France had failed to ratify it on her part, King\r\nConstantine rightly considered himself free from all obligations on his\r\npart.  He also knew that, far from being lured into landing by false\r\nassurances of surrender, he had been emphatically warned against it by\r\ncategorical refusals and intimations of resistance.  Yet, human nature\r\nbeing what it is, the honest sailor, maddened by his discomfiture,\r\ncalled the inevitable collision a \"_guet-apens_\" and, even whilst\r\nnegotiating for release, he meditated revenge.\r\n\r\nTo him the peace arranged through the instrumentality of the Entente\r\nMinisters was but a \"_sorte d'armistice_.\"  He had agreed to it only in\r\norder to extricate himself from his present difficulties and to gain\r\ntime for resuming hostilities under more favourable conditions.  He and\r\nhis men, he tells us with an engaging candour, were at the mercy of the\r\nGreeks: had he not accepted the King's offer--outnumbered, surrounded,\r\nand without food or water for more than twenty-four hours--they would\r\nhave been ignominiously arrested.  Besides, the configuration of the\r\nground sheltered the Greek troops from the naval fire, while the\r\nLegations both of the Entente and of neutral Powers lay exposed to it.\r\nLastly, a continued bombardment might have driven the Greeks to\r\nexasperation and perhaps to a massacre of Entente Ministers and\r\nsubjects.  It was imperative to give the Allies and neutrals time for\r\nflight and himself for serious war preparations.  The delivery of the\r\nwhole stock of arms had been fixed by his Ultimatum for 15 December.\r\nIn that fortnight he proposed to obtain from his Government the forces\r\nnecessary {164} for a battle, and permission to bombard Athens in\r\nearnest--with or without notice to its inhabitants, but, of course,\r\nalways with due regard for its _monuments historiques_.\r\n\r\nSuch was his plan.  General Sarrail embraced it with ardour; the Paris\r\nGovernment sanctioned it; troops began to arrive and French and British\r\nresidents to flee (3-5 Dec.).  But very soon difficulties became\r\nmanifest.  The transports had brought men and mules, but no provisions\r\nfor either.  Greek volunteers and regulars mustered in defence of their\r\ncapital.  The British Admiral declined to take part in any war\r\noperations.  The French Minister dreaded open hostilities.  In the\r\ncircumstances, Admiral Dartige found it expedient to \"give proof of his\r\nspirit of self-denial,\" by renouncing his heroic dream of vengeance\r\n\"_immédiate, retentissante,_\" and by advising Paris not to set up a new\r\nfront at Athens: after all, the matter was not really worth a war.  He\r\nnow proposed, instead, a pacific blockade; and, Paris assenting, he\r\nproclaimed the blockade as from 8 December.[3]\r\n\r\nWith this act Admiral Dartige du Fournet's career came to a sudden end.\r\nA few days later the French Government deprived him of his command and\r\nplaced him on the retired list.  After a decent interval, the British\r\nGovernment decorated him with the Grand Cross of the Bath.[4]  Whether\r\nhis conduct entitled him to a decoration, his character should\r\ncertainly have saved him from disgrace; for of all the men engaged in\r\nthese transactions, he seems to have been the most respectable.  No\r\nimpartial reader of his book can fail to see that he blundered because\r\nhe moved in the dark: it was never explained to him what political\r\ndesigns lay beneath the pretended military necessities; and the\r\nconstant incongruity between the avowed aims of his employers and the\r\nsteps dictated by his instructions tended to bewilder a mind devoid of\r\nall aptitude or appetite for diplomacy.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dartige gone, the blockade was carried on by his successor,\r\nAdmiral Gauchet.  The Greeks took it as an accustomed evil.  \"This\r\nmeasure,\" wrote one of their {165} leading journals, \"cannot terrify a\r\npopulation which has faced with serenity and fortitude much greater\r\ndangers.  The Hellenic people did not hesitate, when the need arose, to\r\ncome into collision with four Great Powers in defence of its\r\nindependence and honour.  It did so without hate, without perturbation,\r\nbut calmly, as one performs an imposed and unavoidable duty.  It\r\ndeliberately chose to risk annihilation rather than see its fatherland\r\ndisarmed and enslaved.  It preferred a hopeless struggle to\r\ndegradation.  To-day it is threatened with the spectre of famine.  It\r\nwill face that spectre with serenity and fortitude.  The menace is\r\naimed at its stomach: very well, the people will tighten its belt.\" [5]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Paris, London, and Petrograd were vigorously\r\ndiscussing the demands which were to be enforced by the blockade; but,\r\nowing to the wide divergences of opinion existing between the various\r\nCabinets, decisions could only be reached by degrees and dealt out by\r\ndoses.  Not until 14 December did the Entente Governments deliver\r\nthemselves of the first-fruit of their travail: Greece was to keep the\r\narms of which she could not be despoiled, but she should remove them,\r\nas well as her army, from the northern regions bordering on Macedonia.\r\nThe Hellenic Government was given twenty-four hours in which to comply;\r\nrefusal would constitute an act of hostility, and the Allied Ministers\r\nwould forthwith leave Athens.[6]\r\n\r\nTo show that they were in earnest, the French and British Ministers\r\nembarked on two ships moored at the Piraeus, where they awaited the\r\nHellenic Government's reply; and, before the time-limit expired, the\r\nFrench Admiral, by a notice put up at the Piraeus town-hall, warned the\r\ninhabitants to close their shops and retire to their homes by 4 p.m. in\r\nview of an impending bombardment of Athens.\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic Government acceded to the contents of the Ultimatum, and\r\nimmediately gave orders for the removal of troops and war material.[7]\r\nThis prompt compliance was received by the people of Greece with {166}\r\nloud disapproval.  They criticized vehemently their rulers' readiness\r\nto yield as pusillanimous and injudicious.  The Government, they said,\r\ninstead of profiting by the events of 1 December to clear up the\r\nsituation, drifts back into the path of concessions which led to those\r\nfatal events: it encourages the Entente Powers to put forward\r\nincreasingly exorbitant pretensions, and, forgetting that it is for us\r\nto complain and claim better treatment, it creates the impression that\r\nthey are in the right and we in the wrong.  For some time past such had\r\nbeen the tone even of moderate critics; and upon this fresh submission\r\nthere was a general outcry of alarm.  It is true, the Allies in their\r\nNote averred that they demanded the removal of troops and guns simply\r\nand solely \"in order to secure their forces against an attack.\"  But\r\nthe Greeks were less inclined than ever to treat the alleged danger to\r\nthe Allied army in Macedonia as anything more than a pretext: the true\r\nobject, they maintained, was to secure M. Venizelos's return and the\r\nexpulsion of King Constantine.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Entente representatives hitherto had given only too\r\nmuch ground for such bitter suspicions, and the search of Venizelist\r\nhouses had recently produced concrete evidence, in the form of a letter\r\nfrom the Leader to one of his adherents stating, among other things,\r\nthat a definite agreement concluded between him and the representatives\r\nof the Entente Powers assured his speedy domination of Athens through\r\nthe whole strength of the Entente.  The publication of this document,\r\nwith a photographic facsimile,[8] had confirmed the apprehensions which\r\nhad long haunted the popular mind.  Nor did M. Venizelos's indignant\r\ndenial of its authenticity, or the Entente Ministers' emphatic\r\nprotestation that never, since the Cretan's departure from Athens, had\r\nthey done anything to facilitate his return, shake the conviction that\r\nthe big coup was planned for 1 December.\r\n\r\nIf any doubts as to the Allies' ulterior aims still lingered, they were\r\ndispelled by their Press, the most serious organs of which, on the eve\r\nof Admiral Dartige's landing, pointedly referred to the great error\r\ncommitted by the Powers in allowing King Constantine to dismiss M.\r\nVenizelos in September, 1915, and urged that the time had come to {167}\r\nremedy that error, informing their readers that England, France and\r\nRussia were not bound to guarantee the possession of the Greek throne\r\nto any individual sovereign, irrespective of his constitutional\r\nbehaviour.  The coup having failed, the same organs, in commenting on\r\nthe Allies' present Ultimatum, still declared that the true remedy for\r\nGreece was to place her under the control of M. Venizelos; but, as such\r\na course was not possible in the presence of a hostile King and an\r\nover-excited army, the first necessity was to eliminate the Greek\r\narmy.[9]\r\n\r\nHowever, the Greeks submitted to it all with sullen resignation: they\r\nhad learned that the wisest thing for the weak is to control themselves.\r\n\r\nThe next step remained with the Entente Governments, who were exhorted\r\nby their Press organs not to be deluded by King Constantine's\r\nconcessions.  For it was one of the ironies of the situation that,\r\nwhile his own subjects blamed the King for his conciliatory attitude,\r\nthat attitude was denounced by his enemies as a fresh instance of\r\nduplicity.  They affirmed--with what amount of accuracy will appear in\r\nthe sequel--that this great deceiver was making, in concert with the\r\nKaiser, stealthy preparations for war against the Allies, and that\r\nmeanwhile he intended by a semblance of submission to lull them into a\r\nfalse security.  Extreme measures were, therefore, needed, not only to\r\npunish him for his past crimes, but also to prevent Greece from\r\nbecoming a base of hostile operations in the near future.\r\n\r\nThus certain in advance of public support, the Allies, on 31 December,\r\nserved upon the Hellenic Government a series of demands divided into\r\nguarantees and reparations.  Under the first heading, Greece was\r\nrequired to transfer all her arms and munitions to the Peloponnesus,\r\nwhich, being practically an island, could be guarded by the Allied\r\nFleet; to forbid all Reservist meetings north of the Peloponnesus; to\r\nenforce rigorously the law prohibiting civilians from carrying arms; to\r\nadmit the re-establishment of the foreign controls over her police,\r\ntelegraphs, telephones, and railways.  Under the second, all persons\r\ndetained on charges of high-treason, conspiracy, and sedition, should\r\nbe immediately released, and those who {168} had suffered indemnified;\r\nthe General commanding the Athens garrison on 1 December should be\r\ncashiered; formal apologies should be tendered to the Allied Ministers\r\nand their flags publicly saluted in the presence of the assembled\r\ngarrison.  On their part, the Powers gave Greece a formal undertaking\r\nthat they would not allow the forces of the Salonica Government to take\r\nadvantage of the withdrawal of the Royal troops from Thessaly in order\r\nto cross the neutral zone.  They ended with the announcement that the\r\nblockade would be maintained until satisfaction had been accorded on\r\nall the above points, and that they reserved to themselves full liberty\r\nof further action should the attitude of the King's Government give\r\nthem fresh cause for complaint.[10]\r\n\r\nBefore returning a definite answer to this Note, the Hellenic\r\nGovernment submitted a Memorandum by which it promised forthwith the\r\nreparations demanded, except the wholesale release without trial of\r\npolitical prisoners; and accepted in principle the demand for\r\nguarantees on condition that the Powers, on their part, should give an\r\nabsolute and irrevocable guarantee against the extension of the\r\nrevolutionary movement, not only across the neutral zone, but over any\r\nterritories which had not been annexed by the Salonica Committee before\r\n1 December, pointing out that this was an indispensable requisite to\r\nreassure the nation and induce it to acquiesce in total disarmament.\r\nIn conclusion, the Hellenic Government expressed the hope that, as\r\ntotal disarmament would put Greece out of all possibility of hurting\r\nthe Allies, they would renounce the liberty of further action which\r\nthey had reserved to themselves, and that they would, in justice to the\r\npeople, raise the blockade.[11]\r\n\r\nIn reply, the Allies launched another Ultimatum: insisting upon the\r\ndefinite acceptance of their demands.  If such acceptance were not\r\nforthcoming within forty-eight hours, or if, after an undertaking was\r\ngiven, any obstacles were wilfully placed in its execution, they\r\nthreatened to have recourse to their military and naval weapons.  On\r\nthe other hand, they promised to respect Greece's resolution {169} to\r\nkeep out of the War, and pledged themselves not to allow the adherents\r\nof the Salonica Government to take advantage of the withdrawal of the\r\nGreek troops into the Peloponnesus in order to invade by land or by sea\r\nany part whatever of Greek territory thus left defenceless, or to\r\npermit the installation of Venizelist authorities in any territories\r\nactually in the possession of the Royal Government which they might see\r\nfit to occupy hereafter for military reasons.  Lastly, they signified\r\ntheir readiness to raise the blockade as soon as special delegates\r\nshould judge that the evacuation of troops and material had been partly\r\ncarried out, and that its completion was assured.[12]\r\n\r\nThese pledges, which had been the subject of acute discussion between\r\nthe Allies at the Rome Conference, and were carried in face of strong\r\nopposition from France, marked another victory of moderation over\r\nconsistency.  That they lessened the alarm of the Greek people may be\r\ndoubted; but the Greek people had by this time found that if it wanted,\r\nnot only to live at peace, but to exist at all, it had to accept the\r\nsituation on the Allies' own terms.\r\n\r\nAs to the rulers, they understood the popular feeling, sympathized with\r\nit, shared it.  But their powerlessness prevented them from refusing\r\nterms which their pride compelled them to resent.  They could not\r\nentertain seriously thoughts of active resistance, unless the Allies\r\nwere attacked by the Germans; but how little prospect of this there was\r\nhas been revealed by a number of messages exchanged at that period\r\nbetween Athens and Berlin.  From these documents it appears that on 6\r\nDecember the Queen, whose indignation at the long-sustained persecution\r\nhad been brought to a head by the bombardment of her home and the\r\nnarrow escape of her children, telegraphed to her brother, anxiously\r\ninquiring when the Germans would be ready for a decisive offensive in\r\nMacedonia.  On 16 December the Kaiser replied to his sister, condoling\r\nwith her on the ordeal she and her husband had gone through,\r\ncongratulating them on the courage they had displayed, pointing out\r\nthat the Entente had once more {170} shown clearly what its real aims\r\nwere, and expressing the opinion that no other course was left to King\r\nConstantine but \"to turn openly on his executioners: Tino's\r\nintervention with his main forces against Sarrail's left wing would be\r\ndecisive,\" he said.  The Queen answered, on 26 December, that the\r\nsolution the Kaiser advised would be possible only if Sarrail, attacked\r\nby the Germans, were forced to retire into the parts of Greece occupied\r\nby the Royalists: as it was, the distance which separated his left wing\r\nfrom them was too great and their lines of communication would be too\r\nmuch exposed: besides, their provisions and munitions were not\r\nsufficient for a prolonged struggle.  Under these conditions, she\r\nadded, only a speedy attack by the Germans could afford Greece the\r\nopportunity of fighting for deliverance from a frightful situation.\r\nBut Von Hindenburg did not see his way to promise an attack.\r\nMeanwhile, the pressure of the blockade increased.  By 2 January, the\r\nQueen, as her indignation cooled, prepared to resign herself to the\r\nsituation: \"We have bread only for a few days more, other provisions\r\nare also running short,\" she telegraphed, \"consequently war against the\r\nEntente is out of the question now.  I consider the game lost.\"  Her\r\nhusband concurred.[13]\r\n\r\nThe King and his Ministers also knew that, unless they accepted the\r\nAllies' terms, worse would be forced upon them by starvation.  Clearly,\r\nthe first thing to be done was to have the blockade raised.  So far the\r\nlittle ship had contended with the gale hardily--in fact,\r\nfoolhardily--coming out of the contest with scarce a sail.  Captain and\r\ncrew at last decided to give up the unequal struggle: the gale appeared\r\nto have almost spent itself: conversations for peace were at that\r\nmoment in progress between the belligerents: at the worst, things would\r\ngo on much as they had been going on, until the end of the War put an\r\nend to the sorry drama.  So, on 10 January, after an all-night sitting\r\nof the Crown Council, Greece made her {171} unconditional surrender:\r\nshe would drain the cup of humiliation to its bitterest dregs.[14]\r\n\r\nTo all seeming, the pledges given by both sides formed a solid basis\r\nfor a _modus vivendi_: the King gave guarantees thoroughly safeguarding\r\nthe Allies against any danger, real or imaginary; and the Allies gave\r\nguarantees equally safeguarding the King against seditious intrigues.\r\nAll that remained was that the Allies should exact from the King a\r\nfulfilment of his engagements, and fulfil their own.  They did not fail\r\nin the first part of the programme.  The transfer of troops and\r\narmaments to the Peloponnesus was scrupulously carried out under the\r\nsupervision of an Allied Military Commission, which counted and\r\nexamined every man, every gun, every rifle and cartridge both at the\r\npoint of departure and at the point of arrival.  The Reservists'\r\nleagues were dissolved, and the people, in so far as such a measure is\r\npossible, were compelled to give up the firearms, mostly obsolete, in\r\ntheir possession.  The foreign Controls, so far as the Hellenic\r\nGovernment was concerned, might be re-established at the Allies'\r\ndiscretion.  The Venizelist prisoners were set free, and a mixed\r\nCommission was in due course appointed to deal with the question of\r\nindemnities.  The General commanding the Athens garrison was cashiered.\r\nFormal apologies were tendered to the Allies' Ministers, and their\r\nflags were saluted with all the solemnities prescribed by themselves.\r\nIn brief, on the unanimous testimony of Entente diplomatists and\r\npublicists, Greece loyally fulfilled every one of her obligations,\r\nserious and frivolous.[15]  Yet, despite her Government's reiterated\r\nprayers that the blockade should in accordance with the promise given,\r\nbe raised, the blockade was not only continued, but, as the months\r\ndragged on, was intensified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See _Le Temps_ and _The Times_, 4 Dec., 1916.\r\n\r\n[2] Zalocostas to Greek Legations, Paris, London, Petrograd, Rome, 24\r\nNov./7 Dec.; 25 Nov./8 Dec.; 26 Nov./9 Dec. 28 Nov./11 Dec.; Metaxas,\r\nParis, 24 Nov./7 Dec; 2/15 Dec.

Hautefeuille--a countryman of the\r\ningenious Dr. Guillotin.  It denotes \"a blockade exercised by a great\r\nPower for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear on a weaker State,\r\nwithout actual war.  That it is an act of violence, and therefore in\r\nthe nature of war, is undeniable\";[1] but, besides its name, it\r\npossesses certain features which distinguish it advantageously from\r\nordinary war.\r\n\r\nFirst, instead of the barbarous effusion of blood and swift destruction\r\nwhich open hostilities entail, the pacific blockade achieves its ends\r\nby more refined and leisurely means: one is not shocked by the unseemly\r\nsights of a battlefield, and the wielder of the weapon has time to\r\nwatch its effects as they develop: he can see the victim going through\r\nthe successive stages of misery--debility, languor, exhaustion--until\r\nthe final point is reached; and as his scientific curiosity is\r\ngratified by the gradual manifestation of the various symptoms, so his\r\nmoral sense is fortified by the struggle between a proud spirit and an\r\nempty stomach--than which life can offer no more ennobling spectacle.\r\nThen, unlike crude war, the pacific blockade automatically strikes the\r\nnation at which it is aimed on its weakest side first: instead of\r\nhaving to begin with its manhood, one begins with its old men, its\r\nwomen, and its infants.  The merits of this form of attack are evident:\r\nmany a man who would boldly face starvation himself, may be reasonably\r\nexpected to flinch at the prospect of a starving mother, {173} wife, or\r\nchild.  Lastly, whilst in war the assailant must inevitably suffer as\r\nwell as inflict losses, the pacific blockade renders him absolutely\r\nexempt from all risk.  For \"it can only be employed as a measure of\r\ncoercion by maritime Powers able to bring into action such vastly\r\nsuperior forces to those the resisting State can dispose of, that\r\nresistance is out of the question.\" [2]\r\n\r\nIn brief, the pacific blockade is not war, but a kind of sport, as safe\r\nas coursing, and to the educated mind much more interesting.  The\r\ninterest largely depends on the duration of the blockade, and its\r\nduration on the victims' physical and moral resources.\r\n\r\nWhen the blockade was proclaimed on the 8th of December, Allied\r\njournalists predicted that its persuasive force would be felt very\r\nsoon.  The country, they reasoned, owing to the manifold restrictions\r\nimposed upon its overseas trade by the Anglo-French Fleet, had been on\r\nshort commons for some time past.  The total stoppage of maritime\r\ntraffic would bring it to the verge of famine within a week.  And, in\r\nfact, before the end of the month Greece was feeling the pinch.[3]  As\r\nmight have been expected, the first to feel it were the poor.  Both the\r\nauthorities and private societies did their utmost to protect them by\r\nkeeping prices down, and to relieve them by the free distribution of\r\nfood and other necessaries.[4]  But, although the achievement was\r\ngreat, it could not prove equal to the dimensions of the need.  The\r\nstoppage of all maritime traffic caused a cessation of industry and\r\nthrew out of employment thousands of working-people.  As the factories\r\ngrew empty of labourers, the streets grew full of beggars.  The\r\nnecessary adulteration of the flour produced epidemics of dysentery and\r\npoisoning, especially among children and old people, while numerous\r\ndeaths among infants were attributed by the doctors to want of milk in\r\ntheir mothers' breasts.  Presently bread, the staple food of the\r\nGreeks, disappeared, and all classes took {174} to carob-beans and\r\nherbs.[5]  On 23 February a lady of the highest Athenian society wrote\r\nto a friend in London: \"If we were in England, we should all be fined\r\nfor cruelty to animals.  As there is no flour, our tiny portions of\r\nbread are made of oats, and rather rotten ones, that had been reserved\r\nfor the cab-horses.  Now the poor things have nothing to eat and have\r\nbecome a collection of Apocalyptic beasts.  We go on foot as much as we\r\ncan, as they really could not carry us.\"\r\n\r\nNext to bread, the most prominent article of Greek diet is fish.  The\r\nFrench, who in their treatment of this neutral nation gave evidence of\r\na thoroughness and efficiency such as they did not always display in\r\ntheir operations against the enemy, saw to it that this source of\r\nsubsistence also should, within the measure of their ability, fail\r\ntheir victims.  French cruisers stopped the fishing-smacks and asked if\r\ntheir community had joined the Rebellion.  When the answer was in the\r\nnegative, they sank the vessel and confiscated the tackle, often\r\naccompanying the robbery of property with violence on the persons of\r\nthe owners and abuse of their sovereign.  To the wretched fishermen's\r\nprotests, the French commanders replied: \"If you want to be left alone,\r\nyou have only to drive out your King.\" [6]\r\n\r\nThese speeches confirmed the general suspicion that the ultimate object\r\nof the blockade was to propagate rebellion.  Other things spoke even\r\nmore eloquently.  The few cargoes of flour that arrived in Greece now\r\nand then were sequestered by the Allies and sent to the Salonica\r\nGovernment, which used them as a bait, inviting the King's subjects\r\nthrough its agents to sell their allegiance for a loaf of bread.\r\nGenerally the reply was: \"We prefer to die.\" [7]  Of this stubborn\r\nendurance, the women of modern Greece gave instances that recall the\r\ndays of ancient Sparta.  In a village near Eleusis, on the Sunday\r\npreceding Lent, the matrons and maidens set up a dance, and while\r\ndancing they improvised songs in praise of Hunger.  At the end, {175}\r\nthe men who stood round listening with tears in their eyes, burst into\r\nfrenetic cheers for the King.[8]\r\n\r\nNever, indeed, in the hour of his triumphs had King Constantine been so\r\nnear the hearts of his people as he was in this period of their common\r\naffliction.  Although the operation-wounds in his ribs were still open,\r\nhe met the emergency with dauntless fortitude, and never for a moment\r\nforgot his part, either as a prince or as a man.  \"The King is\r\nwonderful,\" wrote the correspondent already quoted.  \"He never\r\ncomplains, and gives us all courage.\"  Many a time, as the weary months\r\ndragged on, he went over his past course, asking himself: \"Could he\r\nhave been mistaken, after all?\"  No; the more he pondered, the more\r\nconvinced he felt that what he had done was the best for Greece.  Now,\r\nif the worst came to the worst, his sincerity at least could not be\r\nquestioned.  When his friends ventured to express their admiration of\r\nhis stoicism, he answered simply: \"I know that I am doing right.\"  The\r\ngreat source whence he derived consolation amidst all his calamities\r\nwas undoubtedly this consciousness of rectitude: a sense which in him\r\nseems to have been as free from arrogance as it was from rancour.\r\n\r\nThe people who had formerly admired their sovereign as a hero, now\r\nrevered him as a martyr; and the man upon whom they visited their anger\r\nwas he whom they regarded as the true cause of their misery.  After his\r\nflight to Salonica M. Venizelos was never mentioned except by the name\r\nof The Traitor; after the events of 1 December he was formally\r\nimpeached as one; and after the blockade had been in force for some\r\nweeks, he was solemnly anathematized: on 26 December, the Archbishop of\r\nAthens, from a cairn of stones in the midst of a great multitude,\r\npronounced the curse of the Church upon \"the traitor, Venizelos.\"  The\r\nGovernment had forbidden the demonstration, but that did not prevent\r\nmyriads of people from going to add their own stone to the monument.[9]\r\nOne old woman was heard, as she cast her contribution, crying: \"We made\r\nhim Premier; but he was not content.  He would make himself king.\r\nAnathema!\"  Subsequently, every village and hamlet repeated the\r\nceremony.  \"These {176} spontaneous ceremonies,\" observes an\r\neye-witness, \"were vastly more indicative than any elections could ever\r\nhave been of the place to which the great Cretan had fallen in the\r\nesteem of his countrymen.\" [10]\r\n\r\nAppeals from the Holy Synod of the Greek Church to the Pope and the\r\nheads of other Christian Churches availed as little as the appeals of\r\nthe Greek Government to Allied and neutral Governments.  Month after\r\nmonth the blockade went on, and each month produced its own tale of\r\nsuffering:  deaths due directly to starvation; diseases due to the\r\nindirect effects of inanition; a whole nation wasting for want of food;\r\nhorses starved to provide it; mothers praying to God for their daily\r\nbread with babes drooping at their desiccated bosoms.[11]  Yet of\r\nyielding there was no sign: \"Give in?\" said a woman outside a\r\nsoup-kitchen at the Piraeus, in March.  \"We will eat our children\r\nfirst!\"\r\n\r\nIn such a manner this ancient race, which has lived so long, done so\r\nmuch, and suffered so much, bore its martyrdom.  By such an exercise of\r\nself-discipline it defied the Powers of Civilisation to do their worst.\r\nIn spite of the licence given to brute force, in spite of the removal\r\nof the machinery of civil control, in spite of the internment of the\r\narmy and its arms, in spite of the ostentatiously paraded support to\r\nthe Rebel, in spite of actual famine and the threat of imminent ruin,\r\nthe people held to the institutions of their country, rallied to their\r\nKing; and expressed their scorn for the usurper of his authority by\r\ninscribing over the graves of their babies: \"Here lies my child,\r\nstarved to death by Venizelos.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See the article on \"Pacific Blockade\" in the _Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica_ (10th Ed.), Vol. XXXI, p. 401.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[3] _The Times_, 9, 19, 21, 30 Dec., 1916.\r\n\r\n[4] Among these charitable organizations the foremost place belongs to\r\nthe \"Patriotic League of Greek Women,\" which, under the competent\r\nmanagement of the Queen, was able to distribute 10,000 meals a day, as\r\nwell as clothes, blankets, medicine, milk for infants, etc.\r\n\r\n[5] Zalocostas to Greek Legations abroad, 25 Jan./7 Feb.; 3/16 Feb.;\r\n12/25 March, 1917.\r\n\r\n[6] Zalocostas to Greek Legations abroad, 3/16 Feb.; to French Minister\r\nat Athens, 16/29 March, 1917.\r\n\r\n[7] Zalocostas to Greek Legations abroad, 25 Jan./7 Feb.; 15/28 Feb.;\r\n12/25 March.\r\n\r\n[8] The _Nea Himera_, 15/28 Feb., 1917.\r\n\r\n[9] Zalocostas to Greek Legations abroad, 14/27 Dec., 1916.\r\n\r\n[10] Paxton Hibben, p. 522.\r\n\r\n[11] The Censorship succeeded in keeping these facts, as it kept many\r\nothers, from the British public; they were not suitable subjects for\r\nwar propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{177}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nIt seems now proper to return to M. Venizelos and to consider in some\r\ndetail the other measures which he and his patrons at this time adopted\r\nfor the purpose of consolidating and extending his dominion.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, shortly after the Cretan's installation at Salonica,\r\nthe Entente Powers, by a diplomatic fiction, decided to treat his\r\nCommittee as a _de facto_ Government.  It was not until his countrymen\r\nimpeached him as a traitor that the recognition assumed a _de jure_\r\ncharacter, by the appointment of duly accredited diplomatic agents to\r\nhis capital.  These steps were accompanied by other marks of sympathy.\r\nWhile the Allies negotiated with the King, their naval commanders\r\ncanvassed for M. Venizelos--sweeping islands under his sway: Syra was\r\nfirst shepherded into the fold, and a little later the rest of the\r\nCyclades.\r\n\r\nA brief suspension of operations supervened as a result of the solemn\r\npromise given to Athens that the Allies would neither by land nor by\r\nsea allow the extension of the revolutionary movement.  For an instant\r\nthe Entente respected its own pledges.  Just before the surrender of\r\nthe Lambros Cabinet, on 10 January, the Cretan had rushed to establish\r\nanother accomplished fact by liberating the island of Cerigo; but, on\r\nthe Government's protest, the Allies obliged him to undo his\r\naccomplishment; though, on the plea that the island would resent being\r\nreplaced under King Constantine's yoke, it was made temporarily\r\nautonomous.[1]\r\n\r\nSoon, however, these pledges went the way of all words.  Between\r\nFebruary and May, Cephalonia, Zante, and Corfu {178} were converted one\r\nby one: everywhere the apostles from Salonica preaching, \"Be our\r\nbrethren or die of hunger\"; and everywhere having behind them the guns\r\nof France and England to enforce respect for their gospel.  The\r\ninstance of Leucas, the last of the Ionian Isles to be gathered into\r\nthe fold, will suffice as an illustration.  In the middle of March a\r\nFrench vessel, carrying a consignment of maize, rice, and Venizelist\r\nmissionaries, called at the island and invited the inhabitants to come,\r\nbuy, and be saved: they answered that they would never touch food\r\nbrought by traitors.  Towards the end of May, the French Admiral\r\ncommanding the Ionian Reserve was able to announce that the Leucadian\r\npopulation had joined the National Movement.[2]\r\n\r\nTo secure his authority over these maritime possessions, the Cretan\r\nobtained from his patrons some of the warships of which they had robbed\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nA similar propaganda was simultaneously going on in the \"neutral zone\"\r\nand in the lands to the south of it--particularly Thessaly--whose\r\nimmunity from emancipation the Allies had also guaranteed.  Only, as\r\nthis region lay nearer to the base of the Franco-Venizelist Mission, it\r\nbenefited more severely from its influence.  General Sarrail's patrols\r\nraided the villages, harrying the peasants and sparing not even the\r\nhonour of their women.  Anyone who knows the Greek peasant's fierce\r\nviews on feminine chastity can imagine the indignation which such an\r\noutrage would have aroused in any case; but in this case their horror\r\nwas deepened by the circumstance that the assailants sometimes were\r\nAfrican semi-savages--the Senegalese whom France brought to Greece, as\r\nto other parts of Europe, oblivious of the most rudimentary dictates of\r\ndecency and sound policy.  On one occasion (22 Feb.) the coloured\r\nlibertines paid for their lust with their lives: a patrol of a dozen of\r\nthem was surprised and massacred.[3]\r\n\r\nSummary executions were among the methods of {179} military tyranny in\r\nwhich General Sarrail rejoiced without scruple and with a certain\r\nbrutal pride.  When once he found himself obliged to justify his\r\nconduct, he wrote: \"The six inhabitants of Dianitza, who were shot,\r\nwere _Comitadjis_.  There is no doubt in that respect.  Doubt still\r\nexists about eight others.  If they are proved to be in the same case\r\nas the former, they will be shot in the same way.  The two men shot at\r\nLourani were put to death because they were known to be _Comitadjis_.\r\nThe other two, whose houses were burnt down, are likewise _Comitadjis_:\r\nthey would have been shot, if they were not away: they shall be, if\r\nthey are caught.  If a church has been burnt down, it was because it\r\nhad been transformed into a magazine for arms.  If barley has been\r\ncarried away, it has been paid for or requisitioned.\"  After some more\r\nstatements of the same enlightening kind, the gallant soldier\r\nconcludes: \"To sum up, the Greek Government organizes bands and\r\nmaintains them.  The security of our Army in the Orient exacts their\r\nsuppression.  I have given orders to put to death all irregulars.\r\nThese orders have been carried out: they shall continue to be carried\r\nout.\" [4]\r\n\r\nIt was by precisely similar arguments that General von Bissing\r\njustified his severities in Belgium: with this difference, that in\r\nGreece the danger never existed.  Comitadjis--bands of irregulars--did\r\nexist; it would have been strange if the adherents of the King had not\r\ndone everything to counter the efforts of his enemies.  Long before\r\nthis period the French Secret Service, Admiral Dartige du Fournet tells\r\nus, had been busy equipping guerillas on the frontier.[5]  Further, in\r\nthe mainland, as in the islands, the Venizelist recruiting sergeants\r\nsought \"volunteers\" by force: \"How many villages had to be surrounded\r\nby constabulary. . . .  How much shooting had to be done to keep the\r\nmen of military age from escaping. . . .  How many deserters or those\r\nunwilling to serve had to be rounded up from hiding places!\" exclaims\r\nGeneral Sarrail.[6]  Some of the recruits thus enlisted snatched at the\r\nearliest opportunity of regaining {180} their freedom: they fell in\r\nduring the day, and at night they fled with their arms.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that these bands were organized and maintained by the\r\nGreek Government to harass the Allies and keep the line of\r\ncommunication with Albania open, with a view to an eventual junction\r\nbetween the forces of King Constantine and those of the German Emperor,\r\nrested on evidence which, for some obscure reason, was not produced.[7]\r\nBut it supplied pretexts for action the true objects of which were not\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\nDespite his press-gangs, in six months M. Venizelos had only succeeded\r\nin sending to the front some 10,000 men.  He explained to his Western\r\nfriends that he had failed to fulfil their expectations better because\r\nthe neutral zone barred the extension of his movement into Thessaly.[8]\r\nHe had respected that zone until now; but now that the Allies gave him\r\na free hand over the sea, he saw no longer any reason why they should\r\nrestrain him on land.  Therefore, while the agents from Macedonia\r\ngoaded the inhabitants to seek rest in apostacy and provoked incidents\r\nsupplying an excuse for intervention, the advocates of M. Venizelos in\r\nParis and London laboured to clear his way by publishing reports which\r\ntold how the people of Thessaly prayed for liberation from the yoke of\r\nKing Constantine,[9] and exhausted their ingenuity in endeavours to\r\nshow the Entente publics how to break faith with honour and decency, as\r\nwell as with advantage.\r\n\r\nThe victualling of the Allied army in Macedonia, always difficult, had\r\nbecome distressingly precarious with its own growth and the growth of\r\nthe enemy's submarine activity.  Were the Allies to go on transporting\r\nfood and fodder from distant lands across dangerous seas, with the rich\r\ncornfields of Thessaly within short and safe reach of their trenches?\r\nThe seizure of the Thessalian granary, besides {181} helping to keep\r\nthe Allies in plenty, would help to reduce the Royalists to despair by\r\nrobbing them of the harvest to which they looked forward with strained\r\neyes and tightened belts.  In this wise both military and political\r\nproblems could be solved by one masterly stroke.\r\n\r\nIn April, General Sarrail obtained from his Government the orders he\r\nhad been soliciting since January, to go to Thessaly and seize the\r\ncrops; only, as the offensive against the Bulgars deprived him of\r\nadequate means for the moment, he decided to put off the stroke until\r\nthe middle of May.[10]\r\n\r\nAlarmed by these sudden, though not wholly unexpected, developments,\r\nKing Constantine dismissed Professor Lambros, and had once more\r\nrecourse to M. Zaimis; hoping that this statesman, the only\r\nnon-Venizelist Greek whom the slander of Germanophilism had left\r\nuntouched, might prove able to placate the Allies.  M. Zaimis, as in\r\nall previous crises, so now obeyed the call and set himself to discover\r\nsome path out of the wood (2 May).  On the one hand, he opened\r\nnegotiations with the Entente Ministers; on the other, he tried to\r\nbring about a reconciliation with M. Venizelos--the King being\r\nunderstood to be willing to meet the Cretan half-way.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos, on his part, alarmed by the prospect of a _rapprochement_\r\nbetween Athens and the Entente Powers, set himself, as on all similar\r\noccasions, to impugn the Hellenic Government's sincerity.  At a signal\r\nfrom the Conductor, all the instruments of the orchestra broke into the\r\nfamiliar chorus.  The whole Press of France and England rang again with\r\ncalumny and fairy-tale.  Out they came again in regular sequence and\r\nwith unvarying monotony: plots and secret letters, weird stories of\r\nGerman intrigue, constant repetition of names compromised or\r\ncompromising; all ready, cut and dried, for burking any attempt at\r\naccommodation that did not include the return and domination of the\r\nGreat Cretan.\r\n\r\nIt was maintained that the formation of a Government under M. Zaimis\r\nwas but a new artifice of King Constantine, adopted at the Kaiser's\r\nsuggestion, to temporize by ostensibly throwing over a few of his\r\nGermanophile favourites.  During more than five months he had contrived\r\n{182} to checkmate the blockade by drawing on the reserves of food he\r\nhad laid up at his depots.  Now those reserves were exhausted: he\r\nneeded the Thessalian corn to replenish his magazines, to feed and\r\nincrease his army, so that in the fullness of time he might bring it\r\nout of the Peloponnesus against the Allies.[11]\r\n\r\nEven more sinister were the motives which prompted the King's advances\r\nto the Cretan.  While holding out the right hand to M. Venizelos,\r\nConstantine with the left aimed a dagger at his heart: a band of eleven\r\nassassins had just been arrested at Salonica on a charge of conspiring\r\nto murder him--to murder him in the very midst of his own and his\r\nallies' military forces, and under circumstances which made detection\r\ncertain and escape impossible.  Even thus: \"their plan was to arrange a\r\nbanquet to which M. Venizelos would have been invited.  _They are said_\r\nto have confessed that they were sent from Athens to kill the Head of\r\nthe National Government and were promised 4,000 pounds for the murder.\"\r\n[12]\r\n\r\nDay by day it became increasingly clear that the question of Thessaly\r\nformed only part of the larger question of Greece; that behind the\r\ncampaign for the crops lurked the conspiracy against the King.  A\r\n\"radical solution\" was demanded, on the ground that so long as he\r\nreigned at Athens we could not consider Greece a friendly neutral.  The\r\nGreek organ of M. Venizelos in London now openly described the Cretan\r\nas a man sent to heal Hellas of the \"dynastic canker,\" and expressed\r\nthe opinion that the healing could only be effected by \"Prussian\r\nmethods.\" [13]\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of May this concert of sophistry and calumny went on:\r\nnow sinking into low, deadly whispers; now swelling into an uproar that\r\nrolled like a mighty, muddy river in flood through every Allied\r\ncapital, ministering to the inarticulate craving of the public for\r\nfresh sensations, thrilling its nerves, and feeding its hate and fear\r\nof King Constantine.  At the end of the month the curtain went up, and\r\nM. Venizelos stepped forward to {188} make the declaration for which\r\nhis instrumental music had prepared our minds: \"I reject all idea of\r\nreconciliation firmly, flatly, and finally!\"\r\n\r\nHis confederates and subordinates, as usual, went further: Admiral\r\nCoundouriotis: \"Neither in this world nor in the next will I have\r\nanything to do with King Constantine or his dynasty.\"\r\n\r\nMinister Politis: \"No compromise is possible between Liberal Greece and\r\nthe reigning dynasty.\"\r\n\r\nMinister Averoff: \"The one and most important thing is that the dynasty\r\nof Constantine should, like the Turks, be turned bag and baggage out of\r\nGreece.\" [14]\r\n\r\nSo the Great Cretan and his company had given up at last pretending\r\nthat their plot was not directed against their King, or that they\r\nintended to postpone the settlement of their accounts with him till\r\nafter the War.  Their relief must have been proportionate to the\r\nstrain: it is not hypocrisy, but the need of consistency that harasses\r\na hypocrite.  But their outburst of candour was chiefly interesting as\r\nan index to the attitude of the Powers from whom they derived their\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nFrance had long since made up her mind on the deposition of\r\nConstantine, if not indeed on the subversion of the Greek throne.\r\nApart from the hold upon Greece which they would gain by placing her\r\nunder a ruler created by and consequently dependent on them, French\r\npoliticians did not lose sight of the popularity which the sacrifice of\r\na king--and that king, too, the Kaiser's brother-in-law--would earn\r\nthem among their own compatriots.  Further, a triumph of French policy\r\nover Greece was calculated to obscure in the eyes of the French public\r\nthe failure of French strategy against Bulgaria: \"For me the\r\ndestruction of Athens the Germanic came second to the struggle against\r\nSofia,\" wrote General Sarrail[15]; and there were those who believed\r\nthat his expedition had for its primary objective Athens rather than\r\nSofia.\r\n\r\nFor a time French politicians had flattered themselves that their aim\r\nwould be attained by an explosion from within.  But it was gradually\r\nborne in upon them that the National Movement represented but a small\r\nminority {184} of the nation.  That truth first became manifest in the\r\nsummer of 1916, when the demobilization set the Reservists loose--the\r\nReservists upon whom M. Venizelos had miscounted: their verdict was\r\nconclusive; for they were drawn from all districts and all classes of\r\nthe community: the tillers of the plains, the shepherds of the hills,\r\nthe fishermen who lived by the sea, the traders, the teachers, the\r\nlawyers--they represented, in one word, the whole population of\r\nmilitary age.  The disillusion was furthered by the swift suppression\r\nof the seditious attempt on 1 December, and was completed by the\r\nBlockade, which demonstrated the solidarity of the nation in a manner\r\nthat utterly upset the calculations and disconcerted the plans of its\r\nauthors.  Instead of a people ready, after a week or two of privation,\r\nto sue for mercy--to revolt against their sovereign and succumb to his\r\nrival--the French found in every bit of Old Greece--from Mount Pindus\r\nto Cape Malea--a nation nerved to the highest pitch of endurance:\r\nprepared to suffer hunger and disease without a murmur, and when the\r\nhour should come, to die as those die who possess things they value\r\nmore than life.  This was not what the inventors of the Pacific\r\nBlockade contemplated: this was not sport: this was strife--strife of\r\nstrength with strength.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left but force--the danger of creating a new front\r\nhad been eliminated by the internment of the army, and by the blockade\r\nwhich had succeeded, if not in breaking the spirit of the people, in\r\nreducing it to such a state of misery that it now offered a safe\r\nsubject for attack.  M. Ribot, who had replaced M. Briand as Premier\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs, adopted this \"radical solution.\"  He\r\nproposed to dispatch to Athens a plenipotentiary charged with the\r\nmission of deposing King Constantine, raising M. Venizelos to\r\ndictatorial power, and thus establishing the influence of France\r\nthroughout Greece.\r\n\r\nThere remained some difficulties of a diplomatic character.  Russia had\r\nnever viewed her ally's uncompromising hostility to King Constantine\r\nwith enthusiasm.  But the French thought that this attitude was due to\r\ndynastic ties and monarchic sympathies, and expected the downfall of\r\nthe Tsar to change it: they could hardly {185} imagine that the Russian\r\nRepublic would withdraw even that reluctant co-operation in the\r\ncoercion of Greece which the Russian Empire had accorded; and, at any\r\nrate, the voice of a country in the throes of internal disintegration\r\ncould have little effect upon the march of external events.\r\n\r\nThe decision really lay between France and England.  England's, like\r\nRussia's, co-operation hitherto had been but a concession to France.\r\nNeither the Foreign Office nor the War Office had ever taken the\r\nSalonica Expedition seriously; and both departments would gladly have\r\nwashed their hands of a business barren of profit and credit alike.\r\nBut the motives which had impelled London to keep Paris company so far\r\nwere as potent as ever, and English politicians had hitherto proved\r\nthemselves so pliant that, provided French pressure continued, the\r\nutmost which could be apprehended from them was a feeble show of\r\nresistance followed by abject acquiescence.  Notwithstanding the\r\nmoderation England had insisted upon at the Boulogne and Rome\r\nConferences, France had managed to lead her from violence to violence,\r\ntill this last iniquity, to the logical French mind, seemed inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Zalocostas to Greek Legations, Paris, London, Rome, Petrograd, 30\r\nDec./12 Jan.; to Entente Legations, Athens, 19 Jan./1 Feb.; 8/21 March,\r\n1917.

Ribot, accompanied by M. Painlevé, Minister of\r\nWar, came to London and laid before the British Government his\r\nsolution.  Again our allies found on this side of the Channel \"_des\r\nscrupules_\"; and again they set themselves to demonstrate that \"_des\r\nscrupules, si légitimes soient-ils_,\" weigh light against interests.\r\nEven when the principle was conceded, there still lingered some\r\ndisquietude regarding the practicability of bringing about the King's\r\ndethronement without bloodshed.  But the French did not share this\r\ndisquietude, and, after three days' hard talking, they converted the\r\nEnglish Ministers to their point of view.  It was agreed that the\r\noperation should be carried out without war.  The only measures of a\r\nmilitary nature to which the British Government consented were the\r\nestablishment in Thessaly of outposts for the control of the crops, and\r\nthe occupation of the Isthmus of Corinth, should King Constantine\r\nattempt to move his army out of the Peloponnesus: unless the King\r\ncommitted acts of hostility, no violence should be used.  Having thus\r\nsatisfied their conscience, the British Ministers abstained from any\r\ncloser scrutiny.[1]\r\n\r\nThe task was entrusted to M. Jonnart, a Senator of large African\r\nexperience, who, armed with the title of High Commissioner of the\r\nProtecting Powers of Greece, set out at once \"to re-establish the\r\nconstitutional verity\"--such was the formula.  \"His Majesty King\r\nConstantine, having manifestly violated, on his own initiative, the\r\nConstitution of which France, Great Britain, and Russia are the\r\nguarantors, has lost the confidence of the Protecting Powers, and they\r\nconsider themselves released from the obligations to him resulting from\r\ntheir rights of protection.\" [2]\r\n\r\nWith the violation of the Constitution by King Constantine we have\r\nalready dealt exhaustively.  We must here {187} deal as exhaustively\r\nwith the three Powers' claim to act as its \"guarantors\" and their\r\n\"rights of protection.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim rested on a phrase in the Treaty of 13 July, 1863, between\r\nthem and Denmark, concerning the accession to the Hellenic throne of\r\nthe late King: \"Greece, under the sovereignty of Prince William of\r\nDenmark and the guarantee of the three Courts, forms a monarchical,\r\nindependent, and constitutional State.\" [3]  That guarantee was no\r\ninnovation, and had no reference to the Constitution.  The Protocol of\r\nthe Conference held on 26 June, 1863, explains that \"as regards the\r\nguarantee of the political existence of the Kingdom of Greece, the\r\nthree Protecting Powers maintain simply the terms in which it is\r\nenunciated in Article IV of the Convention of 7 May, 1832,\" [4]--that\r\nis, the Convention between the three Powers and Bavaria concerning the\r\naccession to the Hellenic throne of her first King.  Turning to that\r\ndocument, we find Article IV running as follows: \"Greece, under the\r\nsovereignty of the Prince Otho of Bavaria, and under the guarantee of\r\nthe three Courts, shall form a monarchical and independent State,\r\naccording to the terms of the Protocol signed between the said Courts\r\non the 3rd of February, 1830, and accepted both by Greece and by the\r\nOttoman Porte.\"  And above it, in Article I, we read: \"The Courts of\r\nGreat Britain, France and Russia, duly authorized for the purpose by\r\nthe Greek Nation, offer the hereditary sovereignty of Greece to the\r\nPrince Frederick Otho of Bavaria.\" [5]  Nothing could be plainer than\r\nthat the guarantee referred to the \"political existence of Greece,\" not\r\nto her constitutional form of government, and that the three Powers in\r\ndisposing of her throne acted, not by their own authority, but by the\r\nauthority of the Greek Nation, which alone had the right to do so, and\r\nwhich exercised that right directly in choosing its last king.  But\r\nthis is not all.  Turning to the Protocol of the 3rd of February, 1830,\r\nwe read in its very first article: \"Greece shall form an independent\r\nState, and shall enjoy all the rights, political, administrative and\r\ncommercial, pertaining to complete independence.\" [6]\r\n\r\n{188}\r\n\r\nAs to the term \"protection\" occasionally employed by the three Powers,\r\nand by the Greeks themselves, its true sense can be shown beyond\r\nambiguity.  \"Greece,\" wrote the Duke of Wellington, \"once established\r\nand her boundaries guaranteed as proposed, she will have the same right\r\nto assistance and protection against foreign aggression as any other\r\nState in Europe, of which there are many, which exercise an independent\r\naction in all their concerns, external as well as internal.\"  Far from\r\nclaiming to limit her independence in any way, the British Foreign\r\nSecretary emphatically declared \"that the permanent policy of this\r\ncountry towards Greece must be friendly, if Greece should be really\r\nindependent and conduct herself as an independent Power.\" [7]\r\n\r\nLikewise, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, tracing the history\r\nof events and negotiations which culminated in the establishment of\r\nGreek freedom, dwelt on France's successful desire \"not only to\r\nliberate Greece from the Ottoman yoke, but to make of Greece a real\r\nState, a State independent in right and in fact, a State that should\r\nnot be put officially under the tutelage of anyone, a State that should\r\nnot need any perpetual semi-official intervention.\"  By thus making\r\nGreece \"free to choose her friends and allies,\" and \"not under anyone's\r\nprotection,\" the French expected that she would \"look towards France,\r\nwho can promise her, in need, her assistance without menacing her with\r\nher protection.\"  The Minister concluded by boasting that \"the success\r\nis complete.  Greece exists, she is independent.  All Europe recognizes\r\nher: she depends on no Power either as sovereign or as guarantor.\" [8]\r\n\r\nSince the date of these documents and statements, practice had\r\nconfirmed the principles enunciated in them.  As a completely\r\nindependent Power Greece had waged wars and concluded treaties with\r\nother Powers.  It is true that on certain occasions she was prevented\r\nfrom fighting by coercive measures; but these measures were not taken\r\nby the three Powers--sometimes they were {189} taken by two alone;\r\nsometimes by the whole Concert of Europe--nor were they taken in virtue\r\nof any right other than the right of the stronger.  Likewise, Greece\r\nhad framed and revised her Constitution, dethroned and enthroned Kings\r\nwithout asking anyone's permission or sanction.  It is true that in her\r\ndomestic revolutions the influence of the three Powers could be plainly\r\ndetected, but it was wholly in the nature of backstairs\r\nintrigue--carried on by each against the others--such as even the\r\ngreatest Empires experience on the part of interested outsiders.  In\r\nshort, since its birth until 1916, no one had dreamt of questioning the\r\nstatus of the Hellenic Kingdom as a completely independent Power, or\r\nattempted to give to \"the guarantee of the political existence of\r\nGreece,\" which aimed at securing her against external aggression, the\r\ninterpretation that it referred to her form of government and conferred\r\na right of interference in her internal affairs.\r\n\r\nThe present interference, clearly, had no more legal basis than all the\r\nother invasions to which Greece had submitted during the War under\r\nprotest.  Casuistry was merely called in to cloak the exigencies of\r\npolicy: King Constantine's dethronement was decreed, not because it was\r\nlawful, but because France required it, and England, for good reasons,\r\ncould not let France bring it about alone: what Russia thought of the\r\ntransaction, she soon let the whole world know with disconcerting\r\nbluntness.  Petrograd not only withdrew her troops from the\r\nperformance, but made short work of the \"guarantee\" and \"protection\"\r\nquibbles by roundly declaring that \"the choice of the form of\r\ngovernment in Greece, as well as its administrative organization,\r\nappertains exclusively to the Greek people.\" [9]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile M. Jonnart sped eastward, eager and determined to serve the\r\nImperialist ambitions of the French Republic in the Orient.  His\r\nmandate gave him unlimited choice of means, diplomatic and military,\r\nand he fully justified the trust placed in his tact.  On the maxim\r\nthat, the more prompt the display of force, the less likely the\r\noccasion to use it, he decided, contrary to the instructions he had\r\nreceived in London, not to wait and see whether {190} King Constantine\r\nmeditated hostile acts or not;  he arranged for the necessary naval\r\nmeasures with Admiral Gauchet, whom he met off Corfu, and, after a\r\nbrief stop in the Road of Salamis, he hastened to Salonica, where he\r\narranged with General Sarrail for the military measures: a simultaneous\r\ninvasion of Thessaly, occupation of the Isthmus of Corinth, and a\r\nlanding at Athens.  At the same time he conferred with M. Venizelos,\r\nwho pronounced all these arrangements excellent, and suggested that,\r\nafter the removal of the King, he must give the public mind time to\r\ncalm down before returning to Athens: in the interval M. Zaimis might\r\nbe left in power.  The period of transition should perhaps last several\r\nmonths: a prudent counsel with which M. Jonnart fully concurred: both\r\nhe and M. Ribot recognized the danger of hurrying the return of the\r\nCretan to a city which he had been describing as ready to embrace him.\r\nThe programme settled in all its details, M. Jonnart left Salonica with\r\nGeneral Regnault, who was put in command of the divisions told off for\r\nCorinth and Athens, and in the evening of 9 June arrived in the Road of\r\nSalamis, where he took up his abode on board the ironclad _Justice_.[19]\r\n\r\nHere the most delicate part of his mission, and the one in which he\r\ndisplayed most of his tact, commenced.  On the following evening (10\r\nJune) he met M. Zaimis on board the _Bruix_ at the Piraeus.  It was, as\r\nwe know, essential that M. Zaimis should be induced to remain in power\r\nfor a while, to bridge over the gap between the deposition of the King\r\nand the elevation of M. Venizelos.  But it was most unlikely that M.\r\nZaimis would consent to play the part assigned to him, if he knew what\r\nhe was doing.  Therefore, at this first interview M. Jonnart did not\r\nthink fit to demand anything more than the control of the Thessalian\r\ncrops and the occupation of the Isthmus of Corinth.  Agreeably\r\nsurprised at demands which fell so far short of the objects with which\r\nrumour had credited the High Commissioner, the Premier raised no\r\ndifficulties; and M. Jonnart, in order \"to gain his confidence,\" spoke\r\nto him with his usual \"accent of loyalty and frankness\" about the\r\nmagnificent future the Protecting Powers had in store for Greece.\r\nThen, under the pretence that he was awaiting {191} fresh instructions\r\nthat night, he made another appointment for the following morning.[11]\r\n\r\nThe Greek left, and next morning (11 June) returned to hear more.  At\r\nthis second interview M. Jonnart handed to him an Ultimatum with a\r\ntwenty-four hours' limit, demanding that the King should abdicate and\r\ngo, after naming as his successor, not the legitimate Heir, but his\r\nsecond son--a young man who, having no will of his own, was highly\r\nrecommended by M. Venizelos.  Thus the re-establishment of\r\nconstitutional verity was to begin with the violation of a fundamental\r\narticle of the Constitution--the succession by order of\r\nprimogeniture.[12]  M. Zaimis stood aghast--\"wrung with emotion.\"  M.\r\nJonnart spoke eloquently and urgently: the Powers only sought the unity\r\nand liberty of Greece--the greatness of Greece, now divided, partly\r\ndismembered, in a state of anarchy, on the eve of civil war.  The High\r\nCommissioner would do all that in him lay that the change of reign\r\nmight be accomplished in the most pacific manner.  He appealed warmly\r\nto the Premier's patriotism.[13]\r\n\r\nAccording to some accounts, he added two more instances of his \"loyalty\r\nand frankness\" by stating that, when the War was over, the Powers would\r\nhave no objection to the restoration of King Constantine, if such\r\nshould be the wish of the Greek people--a statement which he authorized\r\nM. Zaimis to publish;[14] and that they had no intention to bring M.\r\nVenizelos back: as soon as the unity of Greece was achieved, the\r\nSalonica Government would disappear; only later on M. Venizelos might\r\nreturn to office by the legal way and after new elections.  On the\r\nother hand, if the Ultimatum was not executed, he threatened the\r\ndownfall of the whole dynasty, the forcible establishment of a\r\nRepublic, and the immediate return of M. Venizelos.[15]\r\n\r\nThe interview ended with a grim declaration by M. Jonnart that, unless\r\nhis decree was obeyed to the letter, he would do to Athens what the\r\nGermans had done to his native Arras--reduce it to a heap of ruins.[16]\r\n\r\n{192}\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt that M. Jonnart meant business: he was an\r\nex-Governor of Algeria; his mentality and his methods had been formed\r\nin the African school of International Law.  Remonstrance was futile\r\nand resistance would be fatal: a column was already marching into\r\nThessaly; part of an army corps had landed at Corinth; a powerful\r\nsquadron rode off Salamis with its guns trained on Athens; troops were\r\nin the ports of Piraeus and Phaleron ready at a signal to land and\r\nmarch on the capital.  Confronted with the choice either to help in the\r\npacific liberation of his country or to witness its devastation, M.\r\nZaimis chose the lesser evil; and M. Jonnart was able to report, with\r\npardonable complacency: \"I persuaded him to continue in office, to take\r\nthe message demanding his abdication to the King, and to advise the\r\nKing to accept.\" [17]\r\n\r\nWith this message the Premier hurried off to Athens and straightway\r\ncommunicated it to his sovereign.  Immediately a Crown Council was\r\ncalled at the Palace.  Besides M. Zaimis, all the ex-Premiers and\r\nleaders of parties were present:  Rallis, Dragoumis, Skouloudis,\r\nGounaris, Lambros, Calogeropoulos, Dimitracopoulos, Stratos.  From the\r\nfirst the King announced that he had decided to accept the Ultimatum\r\nand leave Greece with the Crown Prince, in order to spare her greater\r\ncalamities, such as would result from a conflict with the Entente\r\nPowers.\r\n\r\nWhether Constantine would not have been better advised to have opposed\r\nthe landing of the Allies at Salonica; or interned their army when he\r\nhad it at his mercy; or arrested Admiral Dartige du Fournet and his\r\nmarines and held them, together with the Entente Ministers and\r\nsubjects, as hostages: whether by any of those acts he might not have\r\nescaped this final blow, was now of small account:  though the point\r\nprovides matter for very interesting speculation.  Now, with his troops\r\nand arms bottled up in the Peloponnesus and his people reduced by\r\nstarvation to helplessness, all chance of escape was cut off.  A\r\npitiful situation, no doubt, but more pitiful had he attempted\r\nresistance.  In such event, the Powers would immediately declare that a\r\nstate of war existed {193} and France might acquire a permanent footing\r\nby right of conquest.[18]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, two only of the statesmen assembled, M. Zaimis and M.\r\nStratos, pronounced in favour of submission.  The rest were against it.\r\nTrue, they argued, Greece completely disarmed could offer no effective\r\nresistance to the armies and fleets which hemmed her in on every side.\r\nYet it were better that the King should let violence be used against\r\nhim, better that he should be made the Powers' prisoner, than yield.\r\nHis hopes of sparing Greece greater calamities by his abnegation were\r\nvain.  No calamity could be greater than that which would be produced\r\nby an acceptance of M. Jonnart's Ultimatum.  They recalled all the\r\nencroachments upon her neutrality, all the infringements of her\r\nsovereignty, to which Greece had submitted unresistingly, trusting to\r\nthe Allies' solemn promises.  And how had they kept those promises?\r\nAfter the violation of so many pledges, how was it possible to put\r\nfaith in M. Jonnart's assurances?  If the French troops pursued their\r\nmarch into the country, imposed upon it Venizelos by force, dragged it\r\ninto the war, who could stop them?  Better perish without dishonour.\r\n\r\nSuch, in substance, were the arguments used.  The King remained\r\nunshaken.  \"We have no right to doubt the good faith of M. Jonnart,\" he\r\nsaid.  Despite past experience, the man who was perpetually accused of\r\nhaving no scruple about breaking his word, was still slow to believe\r\nthat others could break theirs.  He made all present promise that they\r\nwould use their utmost endeavours to have his decision accepted by the\r\npeople, so that no disturbance might aggravate a situation already\r\nsufficiently menacing.  They all left the Council Chamber in tears.[19]\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon a Cabinet meeting took place under the presidency of\r\nthe King, who, quite unmoved by the objections and entreaties of his\r\nMinisters, persisted in his resolution.  It was then decided that M.\r\nZaimis should draw up the reply, and that the draft, after receiving\r\nthe {194} King's approval, should be communicated to M. Jonnart.  This\r\nwas done, and M. Jonnart having declared himself satisfied, the\r\ndocument was handed to him next morning.  By that reply the Greek\r\nPremier, after noting the three Powers' demand for the abdication of\r\nKing Constantine and the designation of his successor, briefly stated\r\nthat \"His Majesty, solicitous as always only for the interest of\r\nGreece, has decided to quit the country\" (_not_ to abdicate) \"with the\r\nCrown Prince, and designates as his successor Prince Alexander.\" [10]\r\n\r\nThus far the High Commissioner's enterprise had prospered beyond the\r\nanticipations of the most sanguine.  And now his anxieties began.  From\r\nthe moment of his arrival the populace, which two years of contact with\r\nthe Allies had made suspicious, became very uneasy and excited.\r\nThroughout the night of 10 June rumours circulated that an ultimatum of\r\nan extreme nature had been presented to the Government.  Groups were\r\nformed in the streets and squares, discussing the situation,\r\ncriticizing the Government bitterly, and inveighing against M. Zaimis,\r\nwho, it was said, was ready to accept still more rigorous demands.  The\r\ncrowds grew in numbers and vehemence as the night advanced; and, in the\r\nmorning of the 11th, while M. Zaimis was still with M. Jonnart, the\r\nGovernment, to avert disturbances, issued a _communiqué_, stating that\r\nall the rumours of fresh demands were devoid of foundation.  The\r\nPremier in his first conversation with the representative of the three\r\nPowers had not detected any danger whatever either to the independence\r\nof the country or to the dynasty or to the regime.  On the contrary, M.\r\nJonnart had expressed the will of the Powers to see Greece great,\r\nstrong, and absolutely independent.  Consequently the Greek people\r\nought to remain quiet, certain that by its peaceful conduct it would\r\ncontribute to the success of the King's and the Government's\r\nefforts.[21]\r\n\r\nThis declaration had calmed the public for a few hours.  But after the\r\nreturn of M. Zaimis from his second interview with the High\r\nCommissioner, the object of M. Jonnart's mission began to leak out: the\r\nwhisper went round that the King's abdication was demanded.  The hasty\r\n{195} convocation of a Crown Council intensified the public uneasiness.\r\nThe special measures for the maintenance of order taken by the\r\nauthorities, the advice to keep calm whatever happened, which emanated\r\nfrom every influential quarter, the haggard faces of all those who came\r\nout of the Palace, left no doubt that something very serious was afoot.\r\nMore, it became known that during the night the Isthmus of Corinth had\r\nbeen occupied by large numbers of French troops which had taken up the\r\nrails of the line joining the Peloponnesus to the capital, that the\r\nFrench fleet in Salamis Strait had been reinforced, that the three\r\nPowers' Ministers had quitted their Legations and nobody knew where\r\nthey had slept.  Hour by hour the popular distress increased, until\r\nlate in the afternoon the news spread through the town that the King\r\nhad decided to go; and as it spread, the shops closed, the church bells\r\nbegan to toll as for a funeral, and masses of people rushed from every\r\nside towards the Palace, to prevent the King from going.  Soon all\r\napproaches to the Palace were blocked and the building itself was\r\ncompletely besieged by a crowd of agitated men and sobbing women, all\r\ndemanding to see their sovereign, and shouting: \"Don't go!  Don't go!\"\r\n\r\nNumerous deputations appeared before the King and implored him to\r\nchange his mind--in vain.  To one of them, sent by the officers of the\r\nAthens garrison, he spoke as follows: \"You know my decision.  The\r\ninterest of our country demands that all, be they civilians or\r\nsoldiers, should submit to discipline.  Keep calm and preserve your\r\nprudence.\"  To a delegation composed of the heads of the city guilds he\r\nreplied: \"In the interests of the State, gentlemen, I am obliged to\r\nleave the country.  The people must have confidence in my advisers.\r\nGod will always be with us, and Greece will become happy again.  I\r\nadjure you, gentlemen, in the name of the Almighty, to offer no\r\nopposition.  Any reaction would be in the highest degree dangerous to\r\nthe State.  If I, born and bred in Athens and Greek to the marrow of my\r\nbones, decide to go, I don't do so, you understand well, except in\r\norder to save my people and my country.  Pray go to your corporations\r\nand our fellow-citizens and tell them to cease from gathering: to be\r\ncalm and sensible, {196} because the King, at this moment, is\r\nperforming a sacred duty.\" [22]\r\n\r\nThe same delegation succeeded in reaching M. Zaimis, and on coming out\r\nit published through a special edition of a journal the result: \"The\r\nPremier, with tears in his eyes, and the other three Ministers present\r\nat the audience, after relating the sequence of political events which\r\nhave led to this cruel decision about our beloved King, begged us to\r\nadvise the people in his name to face the crisis with sang-froid, and\r\nto assure it that the abdication of the King is but temporary, since,\r\naccording to M. Jonnart's declaration, it rests with the people to call\r\nhim back after the War; that all resistance on the part of the people\r\nwill result in the abolition of the dynasty and the establishment of a\r\nRepublic under Venizelos; that the Allies would not recoil from a\r\nbombardment of the capital and a military occupation; but if the people\r\nkeep quiet, there will be no military occupation of Athens, only some\r\nsoldiers may land at the Piraeus to stretch their legs--and so on.\" [23]\r\n\r\nNothing, however, could allay the popular agony.  As darkness fell,\r\nAthens presented a strange sight--silent figures marching, one after\r\nanother, towards where King Constantine was spending his last night in\r\nhis capital.  They made their forlorn pilgrimage without the least\r\nnoise, and as they went they passed other groups returning with equal\r\nnoiselessness.  \"It was,\" says an eye-witness, \"as if the people of\r\nAthens were visiting a tomb or a lying-in-state.\" [24]\r\n\r\nA crowd remained on guard all night long.  About 4.30 a.m. a motor car\r\nwas seen drawing up at a side entrance of the Palace.  The crowd\r\nrecognized the King's chauffeur and guessed that he had come for the\r\nKing and the royal family, who presently appeared at the door.  The\r\nguardsmen threw themselves on the ground as much as to say that the\r\nvehicle must pass over their bodies.  The King and royal family\r\nwithdrew, and the car went away empty.  Two other attempts to leave the\r\nPalace proved equally unsuccessful.  The crowd would not let any door\r\nbe opened.  Compact and silent, it mounted guard.\r\n\r\n{197}\r\n\r\nSo passed the night; and the morning (12 June) dawned on the faithful\r\nmen and women who watched by the Palace.  The churches again began to\r\ntoll funeral peals, and again thousands began flowing in the same\r\ndirection: the whole town through all its streets--mournful groups,\r\nsoon waxing to mournful multitudes, and other multitudes, streamed on.\r\nFrom an early hour the Palace was again entirely surrounded:\r\n\r\n\"We will not let you go,\" they shouted.  \"We want our King!\"\r\n\r\nThis was the answer the people made to the farewell message which the\r\nKing had caused to be posted at the street corners: \"Obeying necessity,\r\nand performing my duty towards Greece, I am departing from my beloved\r\ncountry with my heir, leaving my son Alexander on the throne.  I beg\r\nyou to accept my decision with serenity, trusting to God, whose\r\nblessing I invoke on the nation.  And that this sacrifice may not be in\r\nvain, I adjure all of you, if you love God, if you love your country,\r\nif, lastly, you love me, not to make any disturbance, but to remain\r\nsubmissive.  The least disorder, even if prompted by a lofty sentiment,\r\nmay to-day lead to the most terrible disasters.  At this moment the\r\ngreatest solace for the Queen and myself lies in the affection and\r\ndevotion which you have always shown to us, in the happy days as in the\r\nunhappy.  May God protect Greece.--Constantine R.\" [25]  Motionless and\r\nsilent groups read this message; but the crowd outside the Palace went\r\non crying, monotonously: \"No!  No!\" and \"He mustn't go!\"\r\n\r\nThese things began to fill the emissary of the Protecting Powers with\r\nuneasiness.  He felt that a clear manifestation of the fact that the\r\nKing had been superseded must be given to the populace.[26]  A\r\nproclamation in King Alexander's name was accordingly issued.\r\nSimultaneously, a notice, the text of which, it is affirmed, had been\r\nsettled between the Government and M. Jonnart, was published.  It ran:\r\n\"To-day at noon, after the administration of the oath to King\r\nAlexander, M. Jonnart by a special messenger announced to the Greek\r\nGovernment that it could send at once authorities to Salonica, since\r\nthe Provisional {198} Government is henceforward dissolved.  It is\r\nequally well-known that M. Venizelos shall not by any means come to\r\nAthens, and that the Powers have no ulterior design to establish him in\r\npower.  Greece is nowise bound to pursue the policy of the Triumvirate,\r\nbut is free to adhere to her neutrality.\" [27]\r\n\r\nFor all that, the people continued restive.  The King's departure had\r\nbeen fixed for noon; but in face of the popular unwillingness to let\r\nhim go, the departure seemed impossible.  It became evident that the\r\nmethods of persuasion which sufficed for the Premier did not suffice\r\nfor the people.  Something more effective than the march into distant\r\nThessaly and the landing at remote Corinth was needed.  Accordingly,\r\nthe destroyers came into Phaleron Bay, and French troops began to\r\ndisembark.[28]  The Athenians, however, did not seem to be cowed even\r\nwhen they saw that the French troops advanced close to Athens.  What\r\nwas to be done?  Was M. Jonnart, after all, to succeed no better than\r\nAdmiral Dartige du Fournet?  The ex-Governor of Algeria, put on his\r\nmettle, acted promptly.  He sent word to M. Zaimis that the King's\r\ndeparture should not be any longer delayed: if the Greek police were\r\nunable to disperse the crowd, the High Commissioner was ready to send\r\nfrom the Piraeus some companies of machine-guns.[29]\r\n\r\nThen, at 5 p.m., a last attempt was made by the royal family to leave\r\nthe Palace.  It succeeded, thanks to a feint which decoyed the crowd to\r\na side door, while the fugitives escaped by the main entrance.\r\n\r\nThe day, in spite of all forebodings, ended without a disturbance.  The\r\nparade of overwhelming force by M. Jonnart and his unmistakable\r\ndetermination to use it mercilessly had, no doubt, convinced a populace\r\nquick to grasp a situation that opposition spelt suicide.  But it was\r\nmainly the example and exhortations of their King that compelled them\r\nto suppress their rage and resign themselves to the inevitable.\r\nFor--Greece is a land of paradoxes--no full-blooded Greek, whether\r\nstatesman or soldier, was ever clothed with the same amplitude of\r\nauthority over his countrymen as this simple, upright, {199} kindly son\r\nof a Danish father and a Russian mother, in whom the subtle Hellenes\r\nfound their ideal _Basileus_.\r\n\r\nAnd so the drama which had been staged for more than a year by French\r\ndiplomacy was satisfactorily wound up; and the curtain fell, amid the\r\napplause of the spectators.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Jonnart, pp. 60-67.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid_, pp. 109-10.\r\n\r\n[3] Nouveau Recueil Général des Traités.

The rest\r\natoned for their self-denial in narrative by proportionate\r\nself-indulgence in comment.  One of them described the _coup_ as \"a\r\ndistinct gain both to _our_ interests in the East and to our _moral_\r\nposition in the world.\"  British agents on the spot must have been\r\nstrangely blind to this aspect of the business; for General Sarrail\r\ncomplains that the _coup_ succeeded in spite of the obstacles raised\r\n\"by our allies, the English.  It was _à contre-coeur_ that 500 of their\r\nmen were furnished me for the descent on Thessaly.  The Chief of the\r\nBritish Staff, no doubt by order, sought to learn my plans that he\r\nmight telegraph them and ruin our action, etc.\"--Sarrail, p. 242.\r\nWithout for a moment accepting the French General's suggestions of\r\nBritish double-dealing, we have every reason to believe that he was\r\nright in the view that the disgraceful affair did not enjoy British\r\nofficial sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{200}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nM. Jonnart celebrated his triumph with yet another proclamation by\r\nwhich he assured the Greek people that the \"guaranteeing\" Powers were\r\nthere to restore Constitutional Verity and the regular working of\r\nconstitutional institutions; that all reprisals against Greeks, to\r\nwhatever party they might belong, would be ruthlessly repressed; that\r\nthe liberty of everybody would be safeguarded; that the \"protecting\"\r\nPowers, respectful of the people's sovereignty, had no intention of\r\nimposing a mobilization upon it.[1]\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of these professions was soon brought to the test.  While\r\npenning them, M. Jonnart had before him two lists of persons marked\r\ndown for reprisals.  The first contained thirty victims, foremost among\r\nthem M. Gounaris, General Dousmanis, and Colonel Metaxas--M. Streit had\r\nanticipated his doom by accompanying his sovereign into exile; these\r\nwere deported to Corsica.  The second list comprised one hundred and\r\nthirty persons--two ex-Premiers, MM. Skouloudis and Lambros, six\r\nex-Ministers of State, one General, one Admiral, other officers of high\r\nrank, lawyers, publicists--who were to be placed under surveillance.\r\nThe King's three brothers--Princes Nicholas, Andrew, and\r\nChristopher--were banished with their families to Switzerland.  In\r\naddition, certain individuals of lower class who had participated in\r\nthe events of 1 and 2 December, and whose culpability was vouched for\r\nby the French Secret Service, were to be arrested and brought to\r\nbook.[2]\r\n\r\nM. Jonnart, forbidden by his diplomatic art from meddling openly in the\r\ninternal affairs of the country, caused this _épuration_ to be carried\r\nout through M. Zaimis.  It was hard for the poor Premier to expel\r\nfellow-citizens {201} who had occupied eminent positions and with whom\r\nhe had been in close relations--not to mention the flagrant illegality\r\nof such a proceeding.[3]  But how could he hope to argue successfully\r\nagainst a man who, under the appearances of a scrupulous conscience,\r\nrecognized no law?  So it came that, after a long interview on board\r\nthe _Justice_ (16 June), M. Zaimis fell in with M. Jonnart's wish.[4]\r\n\r\nThis rapid fulfilment of the \"no reprisals\" pledge was declared\r\nnecessary to make Athens safe for the Allies.[5]  It certainly was\r\nindispensable to make it safe for M. Venizelos, whose immediate return,\r\nby a modification of the original plan, had been resolved upon.  The\r\nFrench, finding things composed into tranquility much sooner than they\r\nanticipated, saw no cause for delay.  Was it not a fact that whenever\r\nthe High Commissioner visited the capital, he met with nothing but\r\nrespect, sympathy, and cries of \"_Vive la France_\"?[6]  It was: in all\r\nages, from the time of the Roman Consul Flamininus onwards, there have\r\nbeen found Greeks loving liberators more than liberty.\r\n\r\nBut M. Venizelos knew better.  Whilst at Salonica, he used to assure\r\nhis Western friends that \"the great majority at Athens remained\r\nVenizelist.  If proof be desired, it is only necessary to organize a\r\nreferendum, subject, of course, to guarantees of impartiality.  Let the\r\nKing and his satellites be put aside for the moment, let controllers be\r\nappointed from all countries . . . and let the people be asked to vote\r\nfreely. . . .  I am sure of a great majority.  Let them take me at my\r\nword!\" [7]  When, however, the King and his satellites were about to be\r\nput aside, M. Venizelos, as we have seen, had stipulated for some\r\nmonths of delay; and now that they had been put aside, he still felt\r\nthat the partial _épuration_ did not suffice for his safety.  No doubt,\r\nthe bayonets which had pulled the King down were able to set him up.\r\nBut M. Venizelos, for reasons both personal and patriotic, shrank from\r\nleaning on foreign bayonets more than was unavoidable.  He had no\r\ndesire to justify the nickname, bestowed upon him months ago, {202} of\r\n\"Archisenegalesos\" (\"Chief of the Senegalese\")--an epithet conveying\r\nthe suggestion that he aimed at turning Greece into a dependency of\r\nFrance.  M. Jonnart seemed to share this laudable delicacy.[8]\r\n\r\nGeneral Sarrail, however, cared nothing for appearances, but itched to\r\nget M. Venizelos out of Salonica at the earliest possible moment.  His\r\nfirst favourable impression of the Cretan as \"somebody\" had not\r\nsurvived closer acquaintance.  He considered him wanting in courage.\r\nHe had no patience with his hesitations.  He felt, in short, no more\r\nrespect for him than men usually feel for their tools; and since he had\r\nnever learned to put any restraint on his tongue, he expressed his\r\nopinion of this \"ex-revolutionary transformed into a Government man\"\r\nfreely.  The Greek was too discreet to say what he thought of the\r\nFrenchman; but as he was not less vain and domineering, their\r\nintercourse at Salonica had been the reverse of harmonious.[9]  Thus\r\nthe Leader of the Liberals found himself prodded back to the city from\r\nwhich he had been prodded nine months before.\r\n\r\nHe arrived on board a French warship off the Piraeus on 21 June.  But\r\nhe gave out that he did not intend to come to Athens, or to call\r\nhimself to power.  An agreement, he said, had been reached between M.\r\nJonnart and M. Zaimis to the effect that a mixed Ministerial Commission\r\nshould be formed to negotiate the unification of the country.[10]  That\r\nwas true.  With his usual sense of propriety, the High Commissioner\r\nwould not dream of usurping the place of the acknowledged chiefs of the\r\nGreek people.  It was for them to take the initiative.  The\r\n\"guaranteeing\" Powers which he represented respected the national will\r\ntoo much to dictate the terms of the fusion between the two sections\r\ninto which Greece had been so unfortunately divided.  Therefore, he\r\ninvited the heads of the two Governments, M. Zaimis and M. Venizelos,\r\nto enter into direct conversations: he offering to act as a simple\r\n{203} adviser, mediator, at most arbitrator.  Both seized on the\r\ninvitation.[11]\r\n\r\nThe main question had already been settled between M. Jonnart and M.\r\nVenizelos: the latter should return to power at once.  But, legally he\r\ncould only return by a parliamentary election, and, as he could not\r\nhope for a majority, neither he nor M. Jonnart wanted an election.  It\r\nwas accordingly decided that, since no reliance could be placed on the\r\npopular will of the present, an appeal should be made to the popular\r\nwill of the past: the Chamber of 13 June, 1915, in which M. Venizelos\r\nhad a majority, should be recalled to life, on the ground that its\r\ndissolution, in their opinion, was illegal.  This decision--so well\r\ncalculated to preserve externals with all the reverence which\r\nexpediency permitted--was, on 24 June, formally conveyed by the High\r\nCommissioner to M. Zaimis, who, doing what was expected of him,\r\ntendered his resignation.  The High Commissioner thanked him and\r\npromptly obtained from King Alexander a declaration that he was ready\r\nto entrust the Government to M. Venizelos, who only asked for a delay\r\nof two days to fetch his Cabinet from Salonica.[12]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the news that M. Venizelos was coming had spread, and the\r\nreturn at that delicate moment of the yacht _Sphacteria_ which had\r\ncarried King Constantine away added fuel to the flame.  In the evening\r\n(24 June), the crew of the boat, joined by students and reservists,\r\nparaded the streets with a portrait of the King and cried \"Long live\r\nConstantine!\"  The column of demonstrators grew as it went along--the\r\npolice being unable or unwilling to check it.  Without a doubt, M.\r\nVenizelos was right: the _épuration_ of the capital had not gone far\r\nenough.  To prevent surprises, General Regnault, commander of the\r\nlanding forces, immediately took the measures which he had carefully\r\nplanned in advance.  By dawn of 25 June, French troops with artillery\r\nhad occupied all the heights round the town: they were to stay there as\r\nlong as M. Venizelos wanted them--and, perhaps, even longer.[13]\r\n\r\n{204}\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions the People's Chosen formed his Ministry (26\r\nJune), and nerved himself to face the people.  Every preparation for\r\nhis entry into the capital had been made.  Nothing remained but to fix\r\nthe hour.  But this he evaded doing in a manner which puzzled and\r\nexasperated the French General.  It was the goal towards which they had\r\nmoved steadily and methodically, step tracing step, through so many\r\nweary months--the crown of their joint adventure.  Why, then, did he\r\nnot seize it?  Why did he shrink from possession?  What did he mean by\r\nit?  The General did not know.  But he felt that it would not do.  \"M.\r\nle President,\" he said to him, incisively, \"Here you are in power; it\r\nis up to you to assume the responsibility.  I have the force in my\r\nhands, and it is my business to secure your installation in Athens.\r\nBut I must have your instructions.  Tell me what measures you want me\r\nto take.\"  The request was a command.  M. Venizelos thanked the General\r\neffusively, pressing his hands.  \"After all,\" he said, \"it is certain\r\nthat people will always say that I did not return to Athens but with\r\nthe support of the Allies.\"  Finally it was arranged that he should\r\nland in the forenoon of 27 June.  An ordeal which could not be avoided\r\nought not to be postponed.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour the French troops entered Athens with their\r\nmachine-guns and occupied the principal points along the route by which\r\nM. Venizelos was to proceed, while the vicinity of the Royal Palace\r\nwhere he was to take the oath of office and the interior of it were\r\nwatched by 400 Cretan gendarmes, his faithful bodyguard, come from\r\nSalonica.  Notwithstanding all these precautions, M. Venizelos and his\r\nMinisters, modestly averse from exposing themselves to the enthusiasm\r\nof their fellow-citizens, motored at top speed straight to the Palace,\r\neschewing the central thoroughfares, and thence to the Hotel Grande\r\nBretagne, in the corridors of which also Cretan stalwarts mounted\r\nguard.  Thanks to this vigilance, as General Regnault observes, the\r\nassassins whom the Premier and his friends feared to see rise from\r\nevery street corner, and even in the passages of the Palace and hotel,\r\nhad not materialized.  But M. Venizelos, where his own life was\r\nconcerned, took no chances: a Cretan regiment {205} from Salonica\r\nlanded that afternoon to replace the foreign battalions.[14]\r\n\r\nTowards evening a demonstration organized in the square before the\r\nhotel gave M. Venizelos an opportunity of appearing on the balcony and\r\nmaking an eloquent speech.  He reminded his hearers how the last\r\nwarning he had addressed to King Constantine from the balcony of his\r\nhouse ten months ago had been disregarded, and how, in consequence, the\r\npart of the nation still healthy had risen to save the rest.  The cure\r\nthus begun would go on until it had wrought out its accomplishment.  In\r\ndue time a Constituent Assembly would be elected to revise the\r\nConstitution so as to place beyond peradventure the sovereignty of the\r\npeople.  Meanwhile, the national system had been singularly enfeebled\r\nand corrupted by the late autocratic regime: the public services did\r\nnot do their work as they ought; impurities had crept into the blood;\r\nthe body politic needed purging.  He would put all this right.  He\r\nwould restore the system to vigorous activity.  Every impurity would be\r\ncleansed from it, and pure, refreshed blood would circulate all over\r\nthe body politic, giving health to every fibre of the State.  As to\r\nmatters external, he thought it needless to say that the place of\r\nGreece was by the side of the Powers who fought for democracy.[15]\r\n\r\nThe next two days saw this programme at work.\r\n\r\nA rupture of relations with the Central Empires, to be followed by a\r\nmobilization, marked the end of Greek neutrality.  King Alexander, as\r\nyet a novice in statecraft, expressed surprise at the inconsistency\r\nbetween these acts and the repeated assurances given to the Greek\r\npeople.  He was told that the accession of M. Venizelos could mean\r\nnothing else but war: his Majesty knew it: having accepted Venizelos,\r\nhe must accept his foreign policy.[16]\r\n\r\nNot less was the young king's shock at another act of the new\r\nGovernment--the suspension, by a Royal Decree, of the irremovability of\r\njudges which is expressly guaranteed by the Constitution.  \"They\r\naccused my father of {206} violating the Constitution,\" he said to M.\r\nJonnart, \"and the first thing they ask me to do is to violate it.\"  So\r\nacute an interpreter of Constitutional Law could have small difficulty\r\nin disposing of these scruples.  He explained to the young monarch that\r\nhe could sign the decree without any compunction: the Constituent\r\nAssembly which would be elected by and by to revise the Constitution\r\nwould legitimatize everything.  He went on to give him a little, simple\r\nlecture on the elements of Constitutional Verity, its theory and its\r\npractice: \"In a short time,\" he concluded suavely, \"Your Majesty will\r\nknow on this subject as much as any of your Ministers,\"--whenever he\r\nexperienced the need of further instruction, he only had to call the\r\nHigh Commissioner, who promised to come and solve his perplexities in a\r\ntrice.[17]\r\n\r\nThe soundness of the instruction might be questionable.  But the source\r\nfrom which it came gave it unquestionable weight.\r\n\r\nBy the time M. Jonnart left Athens (7 July), he had every reason to\r\nfeel gratified at the complete success of his efforts.  France's\r\nprotégé was installed at the head of the Hellenic Nation, ready to lead\r\nit forth by her side; the regular working of Constitutional\r\ninstitutions was assured; and the foundations of a democratic\r\ngovernment were well and truly laid.  In all history it would be\r\ndifficult to find a more signal instance of brute force and bad faith\r\ntriumphing in the name of Law and Verity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Reuter, Athens, 16 June, 1917; Jonnart, pp. 137-40.\r\n\r\n[2] Jonnart, pp. 147-51, 179-80.\r\n\r\n[3] See Art. 4 of the Greek Constitution.\r\n\r\n[4] Jonnart, p. 147.\r\n\r\n[5] _Ibid_, p. 160.\r\n\r\n[6] _Ibid_, p. 170.\r\n\r\n[7] The _New Europe_, 29 March, 1917, p. 327.\r\n\r\n[8] Jonnart, p. 159.\r\n\r\n[9] Sarrail, pp. 102, 153, 234-5.

I will, for once, flatter its authors by imitating their\r\nsummary methods.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos, hating monarchy, yet unable to dispense with it;\r\ndespising democracy, yet obliged to render it lip-homage; maintained\r\nhis own unlimited power by the same system of apparent liberty and real\r\nviolence by which he had attained it.  The semblance of a free\r\nConstitution was preserved in all its forms: Crown, Parliament, Press,\r\ncontinued to figure as heretofore.  But each only served to clothe the\r\nskeleton of a dictatorship as absolute as that of any Caesar.  King\r\nAlexander, without experience or character, weak, frivolous and\r\nplastic, obediently signed every decree presented to him.  When\r\nrecourse to the Legislature was thought necessary, the Chamber\r\nperfunctorily passed every Bill submitted to it.  The newspapers were\r\ntolerated as long as they refrained from touching on essentials.\r\n\r\nAt the very opening of Parliament, for so we must call this\r\nillegitimate assembly, the King, in a Speech from the Throne written by\r\nM. Venizelos, expounded his master's policy, external and internal.\r\nExternally, Greece had \"spontaneously offered her feeble forces to that\r\nbelligerent group whose war aims were to defend the rights of\r\nnationalities and the liberties of peoples.\" [1]  Internally, she would\r\nhave to be purified by the removal of the staunchest adherents of the\r\nold regime from positions of trust and influence.  But neither of these\r\noperations could be carried out save under the reign of terror known as\r\nmartial law.  Parliament, therefore, voted martial law;  and M.\r\nVenizelos, \"irritated by the arbitrary proceedings\" {208} of the\r\nOpposition, which protested against the restrictions on public opinion,\r\n\"emphasised the fact that the Government was determined to act with an\r\niron hand and to crush any attempt at reaction.\" [2]\r\n\r\nNever was promise more faithfully kept.  Within the Chamber it soon\r\nbecame a parliamentary custom to refute by main force.  Sometimes\r\nLiberal Deputies volunteered for this service; sometimes it was\r\nperformed by the Captain of the Premier's Cretan Guard, who of course\r\nhad no seat in the House, but who held a revolver in his hand.\r\n\r\nOut of Parliament the iron hand made itself felt through the length and\r\nbreadth of the country.\r\n\r\nWith a view to \"purging and uplifting the judiciary body\" and \"securing\r\nJustice from political interference,\" [3] all the courts were swept\r\nclean of Royalist magistrates, whose places were filled with members of\r\nthe Liberal Party.  In this way the pernicious connexion between the\r\njudicial and political powers, abolished in 1909--perhaps the most\r\nbeneficial achievement of the Reconstruction era--was re-established,\r\nand Venizelism became an indispensable qualification for going to law\r\nwith any chance of obtaining justice.\r\n\r\nAn equally violent passion for purity led at the same time, and by a\r\nprocess as unconstitutional as it was uncanonical, to ecclesiastical\r\nreforms, whereby the Holy Synod was deposed and an extraordinary\r\ndisciplinary court was erected to deal with the clerical enemies of the\r\nnew regime, especially with the prelates who took part in the\r\nanathematization of M. Venizelos.  Only five bishops were found in Old\r\nGreece competent or compliant enough to sit on this tribunal; the other\r\nseven came from Macedonia, Crete, and Mytilene, though those dioceses\r\nwere under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople, whose\r\nsanction was neither asked nor given.  With the exception of six, five\r\nof whom belonged to the disciplinary court, all the prelates of the\r\nKingdom were struck by it: some were degraded and turned out to subsist\r\nas they might, on charity or by the sale of their holy vestments;\r\nothers were sentenced to humiliating punishments; and {209} where no\r\nplausible excuse for a trial could be discovered, exile or confinement\r\nwas inflicted arbitrarily.  On the other hand, as many as repented\r\nreceived plenary absolution.  For instance, the Bishops of Demetrias\r\nand Gytheion were deprived for having cursed M. Venizelos; but on\r\npromising in future to preach the gospel according to him, they were\r\nnot only pardoned, but nominated members of the second disciplinary\r\ncourt created to continue the purification of the Church.  Even more\r\ninstructive was the case of the Metropolitan of Castoria who was tried,\r\nconvicted, and confined in a monastery, but after recanting his\r\npolitical heresies was retried, unanimously acquitted, and reinstated.\r\nAll this, in the words of the Speech from the Throne, \"to restore the\r\nprestige of the Church.\"\r\n\r\nSide by side went on the reform of every branch of the Administration.\r\nAll the Prefects, and many lesser functionaries, were discharged.\r\nSchoolmasters and schoolmistresses were dismissed by the hundred.  The\r\nNational University, the National Library, the National Museum, the\r\nNational Bank, underwent a careful disinfection.  In every Department\r\nthe worst traditions of the spoils system prevalent before 1909 were\r\nrevived and reinvigorated.  Other measures marked an improvement on\r\ntradition.  Some two thousand Army and Navy officers, from generals and\r\nadmirals downwards, were put on the retired list or under arrest.  And\r\nan almost hysterical desire manifested itself to strike terror into\r\nevery civilian whom his opinions rendered objectionable and his\r\nposition dangerous to the new order: tactics the full brutality of\r\nwhich was revealed in the treatment of M. Venizelos's principal\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\nM. Rufos, a former Cabinet Minister, languished in the Averoff gaol\r\nfrom 1917 until the spring of 1920, when the Athenian newspapers\r\nannounced his release.  About the same time M. Esslin, an ex-President\r\nof the Chamber, who had been imprisoned at the age of seventy-eight in\r\nthe Syngros gaol, was released by death.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the Skouloudis Cabinet, with the exception of\r\nAdmiral Coundouriotis, Minister of Marine who had afterwards proved his\r\npatriotism by enlisting under the Cretan's banner, were arraigned for\r\nhigh treason, {210} referring mainly to the surrender of Fort Rupel.\r\nThe preliminary examination dragged on from year to year and produced\r\nonly evidence which established the innocence of the accused.[4]  One\r\nof them, ex-Premier Rallis, in April 1920, after being for years\r\nlibelled as a traitor, suddenly found himself exempted by Royal Decree\r\nfrom further persecution, because at that time M. Venizelos conceived\r\nthe hope that this statesman might be induced to undertake the\r\nleadership of an Opposition accepting his regime.  The rest,\r\nparticularly M. Skouloudis and M. Dragoumis, one aged eighty-two and\r\nthe other seventy-seven, after a long confinement in the Evangelismos\r\nHospital, remained to the end under strict surveillance, with gendarmes\r\nguarding their houses and dogging their footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe Lambros Cabinet was similarly harassed, until one of its members\r\nturned Venizelist and three others died; among the latter M. Lambros\r\nhimself and his Minister for Foreign Affairs, M. Zalocostas.  Both\r\nthese gentlemen, though in poor health, had been confined on desolate\r\nislets of the Archipelago, where they were kept without proper medical\r\nattendance or any of the comforts which their condition required, and\r\nwere only brought home to expire.\r\n\r\nIn each case--as also in that of the soldiers responsible for the\r\nsurrender of the Cavalla garrison, whose \"treasonable\" conduct became\r\nlikewise the subject of judicial investigation--trial was sedulously\r\ndeferred by a variety of ingenious contrivances; nothing being more\r\nremote from the Government's mind than an intention to draw the truth\r\ninto the light.  The motive of these proceedings doubtless was one of\r\npolicy chiefly--to ruin the enemies of the regime in public esteem by\r\nbranding them as traitors, even if no conviction could be obtained.\r\nBut policy was not the only element.  To judge by the harshness\r\ndisplayed, there was the personal factor, too.  M. Venizelos had had a\r\nfeud with these men and had vanquished them.  They were men whom, all\r\nthings considered, it was more a shame to fight than an honour to\r\nvanquish--and they were humbled: they were in his power.  For a proud\r\nspirit that would have been enough; it was not enough for {211} M.\r\nVenizelos.  He acted as if he wanted to enjoy their humiliation, and\r\nbecause he had them down to profit by their helplessness.\r\n\r\nIdentical treatment could not be meted out to those in Corsica and\r\nSwitzerland, though some of them were sentenced to death by default for\r\nconspiring against M. Venizelos.  But all that could be done from a\r\ndistance to embitter their lot was done.  Whilst at home the blackest\r\ncalumnies were thrown upon them: in exile they were pursued by the same\r\nblight.  Special attention was directed to the \"arch-traitor.\"  He had\r\nbeen dethroned and expatriated; but this was not enough.  His pension\r\nwas cut off.  He and all the members of his family, with the exception\r\nof Prince George, who stayed in Paris, were forbidden to visit Entente\r\ncountries, even for the purpose of attending the death-bed of a\r\nrelative.  Entente subjects visiting Switzerland were forbidden to go\r\nnear them: lest any particle of the truth should percolate.  Until the\r\nend of the War they lived segregated, shunned, and spied upon like\r\nmalefactors.  During the Liberal regime in Greece, while Italian and\r\nSwiss hotels flourished all the year round on Royalist refugees,\r\nRoyalist exiles populated the semi-desert islands of the Archipelago:\r\nthey were gathered in batches and shipped off--persons of every degree,\r\nfrom general officers whose guilt was attachment to their King, down to\r\npoor people convicted of owning the King's portrait.  For the\r\npossession of a portrait of Constantine supplied one of the most common\r\nproofs of \"ill-will towards the established order\" (_dysmeneia kafa tou\r\nkathestotos_)--a new crime invented to meet a new constitutional\r\nsituation.  It extended to the utmost confines of the kingdom.  As the\r\nfarmers were at work in the fields, gendarmes raided and ransacked\r\ntheir cottages for such portraits; butchers and fishmongers were haled\r\nbefore courts-martial for like indications of ill-will; and--matter for\r\nlaughter and matter for tears are inseparable in modern Greek history\r\n(perhaps in all history)--one met a cabman beaten again and again for\r\ncalling his horse \"Cotso\" (diminutive of \"Constantine\"), or a woman\r\ndragged to the police-station because her parrot was heard whistling\r\nthe Constantine March.  Volumes would be needed to record the petty\r\npersecutions which arose from {212} the use of that popular name:\r\nsuffice it to say that prudent parents refrained from giving it to\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\nIf enemies had to be frightened by every exhibition of severity, it was\r\nnot less imperative to gratify friends by every mark of generosity.  As\r\nalready noted, a Mixed Commission had been appointed under the old\r\nregime to indemnify out of the public purse the Venizelists who\r\nsuffered during the Athens disturbances of 1 and 2 December, 1916.\r\nThis body, after the expulsion of the King, was remodelled by the\r\nsubstitution of a Venizelist for the Royalist Greek member; was\r\nauthorized to enlarge its purview so as to cover all losses occasioned,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, by Royalist resentment throughout the Kingdom\r\nthroughout the six months' blockade--including even the cases of\r\npersons who, compelled to flee the country, were torpedoed in the\r\ncourse of their voyage; and was invested with powers of deciding\r\nunfettered by any legislation or by any obligation to give reasons for\r\nits decisions.  Thanks to their unlimited scope and discretion, the\r\nCommissioners, after rejecting some 2,500 claims as fraudulent, were\r\nstill able to admit 3,350 claims and to allot damages representing a\r\ntotal sum of just under seven million drachmas.[5]\r\n\r\nThe number of old adherents confirmed in the faith through this\r\nexpedient, however, was as nothing to the legions of proselytes won by\r\nthe creation of new Government posts of every grade in every part of\r\nthe Kingdom, by the facilities afforded in the transaction of all\r\nbusiness over which the State had any control--which under existing\r\nconditions meant all important business--and by the favours of various\r\nsorts that were certain to reward devotion to the cause.  Beside the\r\nsteadily growing swarm of native parasites, profiteers, jobbers and\r\nadventurers who throve on the spoils of the public, marched a less\r\nnumerous, but not less ravenous, host of foreign financiers, concession\r\nand contract hunters, to whom the interests of the State were freely\r\nbartered for support to the party in the Entente capitals.\r\n\r\nThe economic exhaustion caused by this reckless waste of national\r\nwealth, in addition to the necessary war {213} expenditure, was\r\nconcealed at the time partly by credits furnished to M. Venizelos in\r\nParis and London, and partly by an artificial manipulation of the\r\nexchange for his sake.  It became apparent when these political\r\ninfluences ceased to interfere with the normal working of financial\r\nlaws.  Then the Greek exchange, which at the outbreak of the European\r\nWar stood at 26 or 27 drachmas to the pound sterling, and later was\r\nactually against London, dropped to 65, and by a rapid descent reached\r\nthe level of 155.  Thus in the domain of finance, as in every other,\r\nthe valuable reconstructive achievement of 1909--which had led to the\r\ntransformation of a deficit of from ten to twelve millions into a\r\nsurplus of fifteen millions and to the accumulation of deposits that\r\nenabled the Greek exchange to withstand the shock of several\r\nconflicts--was demolished by its own architect.\r\n\r\nThe illusion that M. Venizelos had the nation behind him was diligently\r\nkept up by periodical demonstrations organized on his behalf: joy bells\r\nannounced to the Athenians his home-comings from abroad, the destitute\r\nrefugees harboured at the Piraeus were given some pocket money and a\r\nfree ticket to attend him up to the capital, the cafés at the bidding\r\nof the police disgorged their loafers into the streets, and the army of\r\ngenuine partisans thus augmented with auxiliaries, accorded their Chief\r\na reception calculated to impress newspaper readers in France and\r\nEngland.  But observers on the spot knew that the \"national enthusiasm\"\r\nwas as hollow as a drum, which under the manipulation of an energetic\r\nminority could be made to emit a considerable amount of noise; that the\r\ndemonstrators to a large extent were a stage crowd which could be moved\r\nrapidly from place to place and round the same place repeatedly; that\r\nsince the schism the great Cretan had loomed small in his own country\r\nand that he had grown less by his elevation.\r\n\r\nSuch terrorism of opponents and favouritism of adherents; such\r\nencouragement of oppression and connivance at corruption; such a\r\nprostitution of justice; such a cynical indifference to all moral\r\nprinciple--unparalleled even in the history of Greece--could not but\r\nmake the Cretan's rule both odious and despicable.  What made it more\r\nhateful still in the eyes of the people was the fact {214} that it had\r\nbeen imposed upon them by foreign arms, and what made it more\r\ncontemptible still was the fact that it functioned under false\r\npretences.  As free men, the Greeks resented the violence done to their\r\nliberty; but as intelligent men they would have resented open violence\r\nless than a profanation of the name of liberty that added mockery to\r\ninjury and administered a daily affront to their intelligence.  There\r\nwas yet a spirit of resistance in the country which would not be\r\ncrushed, and a fund of good sense which could not be deceived.  If they\r\nformerly anathematized M. Venizelos as a traitor, the masses now\r\nexecrated him as a tyrant: a mean and crafty bully without bowels of\r\nmercy who gave licence to his followers to commit every species of\r\noppression and exploitation in the interest of party.\r\n\r\nSuch were the feelings with which the very name of Venizelos inspired\r\nthe mass of the people.  And that the mass of the people was in the\r\nmain right can scarcely be contested.  It would, of course, be absurd\r\nto hold M. Venizelos directly responsible for every individual act of\r\noppression and corruption, most of which occurred during his absences\r\nfrom the country and of which he was not cognizant.  But it was he who\r\nhad initiated both oppression and corruption.  M. Jonnart's\r\nprescriptive lists were really M. Venizelos's, who had long since made\r\nhis own enemies pass for enemies to the Entente.  The \"purification\" of\r\nthe public services, as well as the prosecutions, the imprisonments and\r\ndeportations of eminent personages, some of whom died of the hardships\r\nand privations they underwent, were his own doing.  The multiplication\r\nof offices and officials began with his creation, at the very outset,\r\nof two new Ministries; a measure to which even King Alexander demurred\r\nwhen the list of M. Venizelos's Cabinet was presented to him.[6]  Nor\r\nis there upon record a single case in which the Chief seriously\r\nattempted either to restrain or to punish his subordinates.  In truth,\r\nhe was not free to do so.  He was bound to the system he had brought\r\ninto being and was irretrievably committed to all its works.\r\n\r\nA man who gains supreme power against the wishes of {215} the majority,\r\nand only with the consent of a faction, cannot maintain himself in it\r\nexcept by force and bribery.  He must coerce and corrupt.  Moreover, to\r\nrule without a rival, he must surround himself with men vastly inferior\r\nto him both in talent and in virtue: men who, in return for their\r\nobsequious servility, must be humoured and satisfied.  Whenever such a\r\nusurpation occurs, all the maxims upon which the welfare and freedom of\r\na community normally rest are annihilated, and the reign of profligacy\r\nand of tyranny inevitably supervenes: a regime born in party passion\r\nmust live for purely party ends.\r\n\r\nWe may break or circumvent all laws, save the eternal and immutable law\r\nof cause and effect.[7]\r\n\r\nThe best of M. Venizelos's followers sincerely regretted the unceasing\r\npersecution of their adversaries: they saw that stability could not be\r\nattained without conciliation and co-operation; but they did not see\r\nhow clemency could be combined with safety.  The thousands of officers\r\nand officials who had been turned out of their posts, and the\r\npoliticians who were kept out of office found employment, and the\r\nprivate individuals who had suffered for their \"ill-will towards the\r\nestablished order\" relief in plotting and intriguing: there was so much\r\nunrest that the authorities had to use severe measures.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos himself wished to make his administration milder and\r\ncleaner and to broaden its basis--he was even credited with the one\r\njoke of his life in this connexion: \"I will yet head anti-Venizelism.\"\r\nBut the thing was beyond his power: he had not a sufficient following\r\nin the country to replace armed force; and he dared not trust the\r\nRoyalists with a share in the government for fear lest they should use\r\nit against him.  None, indeed, was more painfully conscious of the hate\r\nfor him which every month increased in the breasts of his countrymen\r\nthan M. Venizelos himself.  From the very beginning of the schism he\r\nhad assumed a prophylactic in the form of a cuirass;[8] and since his\r\ninstallation he neglected none of {216} the precautions requisite for\r\nhis personal security.  During his rare sojourns in Athens he always\r\nwent about escorted by his Cretan guards; while on the roof of a\r\nbuilding facing his house stood two machine-guns, \"for,\" as a witty\r\nAthenian informed an inquisitive stranger, \"the protection of\r\nminorities.\"\r\n\r\nIn general, it is true, the plotting and intriguing which permeated the\r\ncountry were too fatuous to be dangerous.  But every now and then they\r\ntook on formidable shape.  In November, 1919, a carefully organized\r\nmilitary conspiracy at Athens only miscarried through the indiscretion\r\nof a trusty but tipsy sergeant.  Among the letters intercepted and\r\nproduced at the trial was one from a Royalist exile in Italy to another\r\nat home.  The writer, a lady, reported her brother as wondering how\r\nanybody in Greece could fail to understand that there no longer existed\r\nsuch things as a Government and an Opposition, but only tyrants and\r\ntyrannized over, who worked, the former to maintain their arbitrary\r\nauthority, the latter to shake it off and recover their liberty.  The\r\nwork of neither could, in the nature of things, be carried on according\r\nto any constitutional rule or law.  He went on to argue that, under\r\nsuch conditions, deeds which would otherwise be crimes were justified\r\nand even glorified by history as unavoidable fulfilments of a patriotic\r\nduty: force must be met by force.[9]\r\n\r\nSo the national demoralization inaugurated by foreign pressure went on\r\nbeing promoted by domestic tyranny; and of cure there was no hope.\r\nGood men would not associate themselves with the Venizelist regime,\r\nbecause it was bad; and even men by no means notorious for goodness\r\nshunned it, not because it was bad, but because they were shrewd enough\r\nto perceive it was too bad to last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] For the full text of the Speech, see _The Hesperia_, 10 Aug., 1917.\r\n\r\n[2] The _Morning Post_, 9 Aug., 1917.\r\n\r\n[3] Speech from the Throne.\r\n\r\n[4] It also brought to light documents of real historic value, such as\r\nthe dispatches included in the _White Book_ (Nos. 70 foll.).\r\n\r\n[5] _Rapport officiel de la Commission mixte des indemnités_, Paris,\r\n1919.\r\n\r\n[6] Jonnart, p. 183: \"A clean sweep in Greece.\"--The _Daily Chronicle_,\r\n2 July, 1917--an outline of M. Venizelos's programme.\r\n\r\n[7] There have been usurpers, like Oliver Cromwell, who managed to\r\ntemper tyranny with probity; but their cases are exceptional and their\r\nsuccess only a matter of degree.\r\n\r\n[8] An article of this kind was found in his house after the fighting\r\nof 2 Dec., 1916.\r\n\r\n[9] _The Hestia_, 27 Dec. (O.S.), 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{217}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nThe Liberal regime, having few roots in the soil and those rotten, could\r\nnot but be ephemeral, unless the external force that had planted\r\ncontinued to uphold it: in which case M. Venizelos might have lived to\r\nweep over the triumph of his cause and the ruin of his country.  This\r\ncontingency, however, was eliminated in advance by the clashing ambitions\r\nof the Allies--the real guarantee of Greek independence.  Foreign\r\ninterference, made possible by the War, had to cease with it.  And that\r\nwas not all.  M. Ribot, on 16 July, 1917, had declared in the French\r\nSenate that the changes brought about in Greece would have to be ratified\r\nby a Greek National Assembly.  M. Venizelos also had, as we saw, stated\r\non his advent that the 1915 Chamber was but a temporary solution: that in\r\ndue time a Constituent Assembly would be elected to settle matters--a\r\nstatement which he repeated shortly afterwards in Parliament: \"The\r\nrepresentatives of the Nation,\" he said, \"watch with perfect calmness the\r\ninternal evolution of the political life of the country and wait for the\r\nremoval of the obstacles which do not permit the immediate convocation of\r\nthe National Assembly that will lay definitely the basis of the State.\"\r\n\r\nAfter nearly three years of \"internal evolution,\" the time for the\r\nredemption of these pledges seemed to the people overdue.  In vain did M.\r\nVenizelos endeavour to put off the day of trial by arguing that it was\r\nadvisable to avoid the agitation inseparable from an election whilst\r\nGreece was still at war with Turkey, and by promising that the elections\r\nwould follow close upon the signature of peace.  It was natural that he\r\nshould adopt this course: he could not but hope that the fruits of his\r\nforeign policy--fruits never even dreamt of a few years before--would\r\nreconcile the people to his domestic administration.  It was equally\r\nnatural that the people should be impatient: {218} Turkey may not sign\r\npeace for ages, they protested; meanwhile are we to go on living under\r\nmartial law?  They demanded the dissolution of the illegal and, at best,\r\nlong superannuated Chamber, and fresh elections.  The call for freedom\r\ngrew louder, more insistent, more imperious and dangerous, until M.\r\nVenizelos took a first tentative step towards a return to normality.\r\n\r\nOn 6 May, 1920--the day of the publication of the Turkish Peace terms\r\ngranted by the Allies at San Remo--a Royal Decree was issued at Athens\r\nabolishing martial law.  As at a signal, the Press turned its\r\nsearch-lights on the inroads made into the Constitution.  Abuses and\r\nexcesses hitherto held back by the Censorship gained publicity.\r\nPolitical groups started organizing themselves for the electoral contest,\r\nwith every grievance of the past as an incitement to action in the\r\nfuture.  Most disturbing manifestation of all--though one that might have\r\nbeen foretold--streets and taverns resounded again with the song in which\r\nKing Constantine was referred to as \"The Son of the Eagle\" leading his\r\narmy to glory.  Evidently the efforts to root up loyalism had not\r\nsucceeded: far from it.\r\n\r\nWhile M. Venizelos grew less by his elevation, King Constantine was\r\nraised by his humiliation to a condition, if not actually divine,\r\nhalf-way towards divinity.  In many a house his portrait stood among the\r\nholy icons, with a light burning before it, and the peasants worshipped\r\nit much as their pagan ancestors would have done.  It was but the\r\nculmination of a process long at work--a process in which the historical\r\nelement was strangely mingled with the mythical.[1]  Since the Balkan\r\nWars, King Constantine had been identified in the peasant mind with the\r\nlast Byzantine _Basileus_--his namesake, Constantine Palaeologus, slain\r\nby the Turks in 1453; who, according to a widely believed legend, lay in\r\nan enchanted sleep waiting for the hour when he should wake, break with\r\nhis sword the chains of slavery, and replant the cross {219} on the dome\r\nof Saint Sophia.  This singular fancy--whether a case of resurrection or\r\nof reincarnation, is not clear--was strengthened by the fact that his\r\nfall occurred on the very anniversary (29 May/11 June) of the day on\r\nwhich that unfortunate Emperor fell in the ramparts of Constantinople.\r\nThe coincidence completed the association between the monarch who\r\nsacrificed his life to save his people from subjection and the monarch\r\nwho, after leading his army in two victorious campaigns and doubling the\r\nextent of his country, did not hesitate to sacrifice his crown to save\r\nhis people from disaster.  Henceforth, even in minds not prone to\r\nsuperstition, the two events were linked by the same date, the mourning\r\nfor the one rekindled the memory of the other, and King Constantine\r\nacquired a new and imperishable title to the gratitude of the nation.  If\r\nall the efforts made in the past to blast his glory or to belittle his\r\nservices had only heightened his popularity, all the efforts made since\r\nto blot out his image could only engrave it still deeper on the hearts of\r\nthe people.  His very exile was interpreted, symbolically, as the\r\nenchanted sleep whence he would arise to fulfil the ancient prophecies.\r\n\r\nMysticism apart, during the sad period preceding his departure, the\r\naffection of the masses for their sovereign, intensified by compassion,\r\nhad assumed the quality of veneration.  Now that he was gone, they\r\nbrooded over the wrongs which had driven him, a lawful and popular king,\r\ninto exile: wrongs which suffered for their sakes enhanced his claims on\r\ntheir loyalty.  They remembered wistfully the splendour of his victories,\r\nhis manly courage, his saintly patience, and perhaps most of all his\r\nunfailing kindness to the humble and the weak.  This was the quality\r\nwhich drew men most strongly to Constantine, and the absence of which\r\nrepelled them most from M. Venizelos.[2]  The experience of the last\r\nthree years had helped to emphasize the contrast: when the Eagle's Son\r\nwas up above, there were few vultures in the land; now there were\r\nvultures only.  So the name of Constantine became a synonym for orderly\r\ngovernment, loyalty to his person was identified with the principle of\r\nliberty, and the people who had never regarded Alexander as anything more\r\nthan {220} a regent, who cried after the departing monarch from the shore\r\nat Oropus: \"You shall come back to us soon,\" hailed the return to\r\nnormality as presaging the return of the legitimate sovereign as well as\r\nof a legal Constitution.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was the very last thing the powers that were contemplated\r\neven as a remote potentiality.  For them the monarch in exile was dead;\r\nand the sooner his memory was buried the better.  Accordingly, a police\r\ncircular, issued on 26 May, prohibited conversations favourable to the\r\nex-king, pictures of the ex-king, songs in honour of the ex-king, cheers\r\nfor the ex-king.  And, these regulations having been found insufficient\r\nto curb royalist fervour, five days later M. Venizelos demanded and\r\nobtained from Parliament the re-establishment of martial law, on the\r\nground that \"talk about the return of the ex-king was calculated to\r\nexcite public feeling; and then the Opposition might have cause to blame\r\nthe Government for not respecting the freedom of elections.\"  The\r\nquestion of the ex-king, he argued, was utterly irrelevant to the\r\nforthcoming contest: the people would not be called upon to elect a\r\nConstituent, but merely a Revisionist Assembly: \"Who has said there is to\r\nbe a Constituent Assembly?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe answer, of course, was easy: he himself had said so, on his\r\ninstallation in 1917.  But lapses of memory are permissible to statesmen\r\nwho mean business.  M. Venizelos wanted a National Assembly which would\r\nhave powers to ratify the dethronement of the King, the suspension of the\r\nirremovability of judges, and all other revolutionary illegalities,\r\nbesides perhaps altering fundamental articles of the Constitution--such\r\nas the right of the Crown to appoint and dismiss Ministers and to\r\ndissolve Parliaments--powers which essentially belong to a Constituent\r\nAssembly.  But he wanted it to be merely Revisionist.  The paradox made\r\nhavoc of his logic; but it no way affected his purpose; which was that,\r\nwhile as Constituent in its nature the Assembly should effect any\r\nalterations in the government of the country that he desired, as\r\nRevisionist in name it would not be competent to discuss the restoration\r\nof the King, and, if it proved recalcitrant, would be subject to\r\ndissolution by the {221} executive.  Consistency and M. Venizelos had\r\nbeen divorced long ago, and the decree was now to be made absolute.\r\n\r\nWhile these eccentricities prevailed at home, abroad the gamester-spirit\r\nof the Cretan scored its crowning triumph.  By the Treaty of Sèvres (10\r\nAug., 1920), which embodied the territorial arrangements already made at\r\nSan Remo, Greece obtained practically the whole of Thrace outside the\r\nenclave of Constantinople, and a mandate over Smyrna and its hinterland.\r\nNo doubt, this enormous extension of the kingdom, though still largely\r\nproblematical, appealed to that compound of idealism and greed (mostly\r\ngreed) which constitutes Hellenic, as it does all other, Imperialism.\r\nBut it did not fully compensate for the suppression of popular liberties\r\nwithin its frontiers.  Except among the followers of M. Venizelos the\r\nnational aggrandisement evoked but little enthusiasm: \"What is a man\r\nprofited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" wrote\r\none of the Opposition leaders, voicing a widespread sentiment--a\r\nsentiment which, only two days after the publication of the Treaty (12\r\nAug.), found sinister expression.  As he was about to leave Paris, M.\r\nVenizelos was shot at and slightly wounded by two Greek ex-officers.  The\r\nassailants, on being arrested, declared that their object had been \"to\r\nfree Greece from its oppressor and to ensure freedom for their\r\nfellow-citizens.\" [3]\r\n\r\nThe Paris outrage had a sequel at Athens, as significant and more tragic.\r\nThe followers of M. Venizelos, like those of King Constantine, included a\r\nset of fanatics who preached that the salvation of the country demanded\r\nthe extirpation of their adversaries.  To these zealots the moment seemed\r\npropitious for putting their doctrine into practice.  \"Hellenes!\" cried\r\none of their journals, \"our great Chief, our great patriot, the man who\r\nhas made Greece great and prosperous, the man who has made us proud to be\r\ncalled Greeks, has been murdered by the instruments of the ex-King.\r\nHellenes, rise up all of you, and drive the murderers out of the\r\nfatherland.\"  The Hellenes in general remained unmoved.  But some gangs\r\nof hooligans did rise up (13 Aug.) and, under the eyes of the police and\r\nthe _gendarmerie_, wrecked a number of Royalist newspaper {222} offices,\r\nclubs, cafés, and sacked the houses of four prominent anti-Venizelist\r\nstatesmen.  The authorities, on their side, had a dozen leaders of\r\nOpposition groups thrown into prison and, pending their conviction, M.\r\nRepoulis, a Minister who in the absence of M. Venizelos acted as his\r\nDeputy, declared that the attempt on the Premier formed part of a plot\r\nlong-planned for the overthrow of the regime: it had failed, but the\r\nheads of the culprits would fall without fail.  In fact, one of the\r\nOpposition leaders--Ion Dragoumis, son of the ex-Premier of that\r\nname--was assassinated by the Cretan guards who had arrested him.  The\r\nothers, after being kept in solitary confinement for twenty-four days,\r\nhad to be released for want of any incriminating evidence.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos in Paris, when he heard of the riots, was reported as being\r\nbeside himself with righteous indignation; and he sent a strongly-worded\r\ntelegram to the Government, expressing the fear that part of the\r\nresponsibility for the disorders rested upon its organs, and assuring it\r\nthat he should exact full account from everyone concerned.[4]  But when\r\nhe returned home he publicly embraced M.  Repoulis, who explained in the\r\nChamber to the entire satisfaction of his Chief that the Government had\r\nbeen overawed and very nearly overthrown by the extremists in its own\r\nranks (8 Sept.).\r\n\r\nEverything that could be done--short of a massacre--to disorganize and to\r\nintimidate the Opposition having been done, martial law was suspended (7\r\nSept.), and the question of Elections began to engage M.  Venizelos's\r\nattention seriously.  It was a trial which involved his political life or\r\ndeath, and therefore required the utmost care and vigilance: one\r\nill-considered step, one omission on his part might send him to his doom.\r\n\r\nHe began with the enfranchisement of Thrace (9 Sept.).  This province,\r\nstill under military occupation and martial law, was to vote: further, a\r\npolitical frontier was erected between it and the rest of Greece, which\r\nonly those possessing a special pass could cross, whilst a rigorous\r\ncensorship kept all anti-Venizelist newspapers out of it; and, lastly, it\r\nwas enacted, for the benefit of an electorate alien in its majority and\r\nunable to read or write Greek, that the {223} Thracian votes, contrary to\r\nthe general rule, should be polled by ballot paper, instead of by a ball.\r\n\r\nAnother Bill enabled the army on active service, for the first time in\r\nthe history of Greece, to participate in elections, the assumption being\r\nthat among the soldiers Venizelist feeling predominated, or that, at all\r\nevents, they would be controlled by their officers.\r\n\r\nAs exceptional importance has always attached to the district and city of\r\nAthens--\"which,\" M. Venizelos said, \"symbolizes the very soul of the\r\ncountry,\" [5]--it was incumbent upon him to pay special attention to this\r\narea.  The difficulty was that the actual population was notoriously\r\nunsympathetic.  M. Venizelos hastened to overcome this difficulty by\r\nthree strokes of the pen: 18,000 refugees from all parts who lived on the\r\nMinistry of Public Relief were enrolled as Athenian citizens; to these\r\nwere added some 6,000 Cretan gendarmes and policemen; and, to make up the\r\ndeficiency, 15,000 natives of Smyrna, supposed to have earned Greek\r\ncitizenship by volunteering in the war, had their names inscribed on the\r\nelectoral lists of Attica.\r\n\r\nThere followed promises and warnings.  On the one hand, the people were\r\npromised fresh labour legislation, the conversion of the great landed\r\nestates into small holdings, and public works on a large scale.  On the\r\nother hand, they were warned that an adverse vote from them would have\r\ndisastrous consequences for the country: Greece had been aggrandized by\r\nthe Allies for the sake of M. Venizelos; if she discarded him, she would\r\nforfeit their goodwill and her territorial acquisitions.  But M.\r\nVenizelos and his partisans did not trust altogether to the practical\r\nsense and the Imperialist sensibilities of the people.\r\n\r\nFor months past the extremists among his followers openly threatened\r\nthat, if by any mishap Venizelos did not win the day after all, they\r\nwould make a _coup d'état_ and strike terror into the hearts of their\r\nadversaries.  This threat, which primarily presented itself as an\r\nextravagance of irresponsible fanaticism, was on 7 September officially\r\nespoused by M. Venizelos, who declared in Parliament that, should\r\nperchance his adversaries obtain a majority in the new Assembly, and\r\nshould that Assembly decide {224} to convoke a Constituent Assembly, and\r\nshould this Constituent Assembly invite King Constantine back, the\r\n\"Reaction\" would find itself confronted with the hostility of a large\r\npolitical party which had become the mortal enemy of the ex-king; and he\r\nwent on to foreshadow a fresh schism in the army: that is, civil war.\r\nEncouraged by so solemn a sanction, Venizelist candidates--notably at\r\nTyrnavo in Thessaly and Dervenion in Argolis--told their constituents\r\nwithout any circumlocution that, in the event of a defeat at the polls,\r\nthe Government would not surrender its power, but would maintain it\r\nthrough the Army of National Defence, which was pledged to a new\r\nRevolution: the Parliamentary system would cease to function even in\r\nname, and many a malignant would swing.\r\n\r\nThese appeals to the sovereign people, published in the Royalist and not\r\ncontradicted by the Venizelist Press, will doubtless seem startling for a\r\nGovernment whose mission was to establish democratic liberties.  But they\r\nwere justified by necessity.  M. Venizelos and his partisans could not\r\nafford to be very fastidious: their political existence was at stake:\r\nthey must make every effort, and summon every resource at their command.\r\nAnyone who was in Athens at that time and saw the Cretan guards, often\r\nwith the Premier's photograph pinned on their breasts, assault such\r\ncitizens as displayed the olive-twig (emblem of the Opposition), or saw\r\nthe gendarmes, who patrolled the streets with fixed bayonets, protect the\r\nexcesses of Venizelist bravoes, would appreciate how far the Government\r\nwas prepared to stoop in order to survive.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these electoral activities, King Alexander died--of blood\r\npoisoning caused by the bite of a pet monkey.  Alive he had neither\r\nexercised nor been wanted to exercise any influence over the destinies of\r\nhis country: he had simply played the part required by the cast in which\r\na whimsical fortune had placed him.  His death proved of more importance,\r\ninasmuch as it forced the question of the throne upon M. Venizelos\r\nirresistibly: the vacancy had to be filled.  Anxious to perpetuate the\r\ncomedy, M. Venizelos sought a successor in a still younger and\r\nless-experienced scion of the dynasty: Prince Paul, a lad in his teens,\r\nwho refused the offer on the ground that, until his father and his eldest\r\nbrother renounced their rights, {225} he could not lawfully ascend the\r\nthrone.  After threatening to change the dynasty rather than admit any\r\ndiscussion on the restoration of King Constantine, M. Venizelos, by one\r\nof those swift turns characteristic of him, suddenly made that\r\nrestoration the main issue of the Elections.  He challenged the\r\nOpposition to this test of the real wishes of the Greek people.  The\r\nGreek people, he said, should be given the chance of deciding whether it\r\nwill have Constantine back; and if it so decided, he himself would go.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition, which consisted of no fewer than sixteen different groups\r\nunited only by a common desire to get rid of the Cretan Dictator, would\r\nfain decline the challenge.  Some of the leaders were ardent Royalists;\r\nothers were very lukewarm ones; and others still could hardly be\r\ndescribed as Royalists at all.  Generally speaking, the politicians out\r\nof office had found in the cause of Constantine a national badge for a\r\nparty feud.  Moreover, they realized that the question of Constantine\r\npossessed an international as well as a national aspect, and they did not\r\nwish to compromise the future of Greece and their own; which would have\r\nbeen nothing else than stepping into the very pit M. Venizelos had dug\r\nfor them.  But neither could they repudiate Constantine without losing\r\npopular support: to the Greek people the main issue of the fight was\r\nindeed what M. Venizelos made it.\r\n\r\nAt length the day of trial arrived: a Sunday (14 Nov.)--a day of leisure\r\nin a land of universal suffrage.  From an early hour people of all\r\nclasses thronged the polling-stations quietly.  They had clamoured for a\r\nchance of expressing their sentiments; yet now that the chance had come,\r\nthey took it with an extraordinary composure.  Even to the most expert\r\neye the electors' demeanour gave no indication of their sentiments: the\r\nolive-twig had very curiously withered out of sight.  Nor did the\r\nbehaviour of the voters in the last three years afford any clue to the\r\nuse they would make of their present opportunity.  Greeks are past\r\nmasters of simulation and dissimulation.  Openly some might have\r\npretended friendship to the Venizelist regime from hopes of favour,\r\nothers again dissembled hostility through fear; but the voting was secret.\r\n\r\nBoth Government and Opposition shared the suspense, {226} though the\r\nGovernment anticipated an overwhelming majority;[6] which was natural\r\nenough, since all the advantage seemed on its side.\r\n\r\nPresently the votes were counted--and \"it was officially announced that\r\nthe Government had been mistaken in its anticipations.\"  The magnitude of\r\nthe mistake appeared on the publication of the figures: 250 seats to 118:\r\nthe Royalists had swept the polls, to the astonishment of all parties,\r\nincluding their own.[7]  The very men who had fought at the bidding of M.\r\nVenizelos had pronounced themselves against him: having fulfilled their\r\nduty as soldiers, they vindicated their right to live as free citizens.\r\nHis own constituency had rejected him.  And would the rout stop there?\r\nAmong the millions who had submitted to his rule with sullen irritation\r\nthere were many whose hearts swelled with rage, in whom old wounds\r\nrankled and festered: might not these men now have recourse to other\r\nweapons than the vote in order to get even with the bully?\r\n\r\nFor a moment M. Venizelos felt stupefied: the edifice that had seemed so\r\nsolid was collapsing about him, and he was in danger of being buried\r\nunder the ruins.  Then he wisely stole out of the country he had done his\r\nbest to aggrandize and to disintegrate.[8]\r\n\r\nThe result of the elections was virtually an invitation to King\r\nConstantine to return and resume his crown.  But the King, not content\r\nwith an indirect verdict, wanted an explicit plebiscite _ad hoc_, clear\r\nof all other issues.  The Allies, after a conference in London,\r\ntelegraphed (2 Dec.) {227} to M. Rallis, the new Greek Premier, that they\r\n\"had no wish to interfere in the internal affairs of Greece, but they\r\nfelt bound to declare publicly that the restoration of the throne to a\r\nking whose disloyal attitude and conduct towards the Allies during the\r\nWar caused them great embarrassment and loss could only be regarded by\r\nthem as a ratification by Greece of his hostile acts.\" [9]  This\r\nmessage--yet another fruit of Franco-British compromise--was followed up\r\n(6 Dec.) by a second Note, enumerating the consequences, political and\r\nfinancial, of the Powers' displeasure.  But it produced little effect:\r\nout of the 1,013,724 electors who took part in the plebiscite (7 Dec.),\r\nonly 10,383 voted against the King.[10]  M. Rallis, in acquainting him\r\nwith the result, stated that he considered it tantamount to a formal\r\nrequest from the country to the Sovereign to come into his own again, and\r\ninvited him to respond to the clearly expressed wish of the nation.\r\nWhich King Constantine did, nothing loth.\r\n\r\nFew of those who witnessed the event will ever forget it.  On the eve of\r\nthe King's return (18 Dec.) Athens could scarcely contain her emotion.\r\nAll day long her beflagged streets rang with the cry: \"_Erchetai!\r\nErchetai!_\" (\"He is coming!  He is coming!\")--hardly anybody failed to\r\nutter it, and nobody dared to say \"_Then erchetai_\" (\"He is not coming\"),\r\neven if referring to an unpunctual friend.  At night the song in which\r\nConstantine was alluded to as \"The Son of the Eagle\" echoed from one end\r\nof the illuminated city to the other.  But this was only a preparation\r\nfor next morning's welcome.\r\n\r\nOwing to stress of weather the cruiser carrying the King and Queen of the\r\nHellenes was compelled to put in at Corinth, where the exiles landed.\r\nFrom that point to the capital their journey was a triumphal progress.\r\nThe train moved slowly between lines of peasants who, their hands linked,\r\naccompanied it, shouting: \"We have wanted him!  We have brought him\r\nback!\" [3]  When {228} the King stepped out at the station, officers\r\nfought a way to the carriage with blue and silver dressed postillions\r\nwhich waited for him and the Queen.  He had to keep tossing from one hand\r\nto the other his baton, as men and women pressed upon him for a\r\nhandshake.  The carriage struggled forward, men and women clinging to its\r\nsteps and running with it, trying to kiss the hands and feet of the royal\r\npair, and baulked of this, kissing even the horses and the carriage\r\nitself.  All the way dense masses of people pressed round the carriage,\r\nshouting: \"He has come!\" or singing the chorus, \"Again our King will draw\r\nthe sword.\"  An eye-witness had a vision of a soldier who, amid cries of\r\n\"We will die for you, Godfather!\" clambered into the carriage head first\r\nand fell to kissing the knees of the King and Queen, while around people\r\nfainted and stretchers pressed through the crowd.[12]\r\n\r\nAnd so the fight for the soul of Greece ended in a victory for\r\nConstantine.\r\n\r\nThe character of this prince has been painted in the most opposite\r\ncolours, as must always be the case when a man becomes the object of\r\nfervent worship and bitter enmity.  But the bare record of what he did\r\nand endured reveals him sufficiently.  His qualities speak through his\r\nactions, so that he who runs may read.  His most conspicuous defect was a\r\nwant of suppleness--a certain rigidity of spirit which, when he\r\nsucceeded, was called firmness, and when he failed, obstinacy.  Yet the\r\ncharge so often brought against him, that he allowed himself to be misled\r\nby evil counsellors, shows that this persistence in his own opinion did\r\nnot spring from egoism nor was incompatible with deference to the\r\nopinions of others.  It arose from a deep sense of responsibility: he\r\nstubbornly refused to deviate from his course when he believed that his\r\nduty to his country forbade deviation, and he readily laid down his crown\r\nwhen duty to his country dictated renunciation.  For the rest, a man who\r\nnever posed to his contemporaries may confidently leave his character to\r\nthe judgment of posterity.\r\n\r\nAs for M. Venizelos, history will probably say of him {229} what it has\r\nsaid of Themistocles: Though he sincerely aimed at the aggrandizement of\r\nhis country, and proved on some most critical occasions of great value to\r\nit, yet on the whole his intelligence was higher than his morality--a man\r\nof many talents and few principles, ready to employ the most tortuous and\r\nunscrupulous means, sometimes indeed for ends in themselves patriotic,\r\nbut often merely for aggrandizing himself.  By nature he was more fitted\r\nto rule in a despotic than to lead in a constitutional State.  Had he\r\nbeen born an emperor, his fertile genius might, unless betrayed by his\r\nrestless ambition, have rendered his reign prosperous and his memory\r\nprecious.  As it is, in his career, with all its brilliance, posterity\r\nwill find not so much a pattern to imitate as an example to deter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] There is always so much of mystery surrounding the peasant mind, that\r\nits workings must often be accepted rather than understood.  But those\r\nwho wish to understand somewhat the psychological process which led in\r\nantiquity to the deification of kings during their life-time could not do\r\nbetter than study the cult of Constantine among the modern Greek\r\npeasantry.\r\n\r\n[2] See Vice-Admiral Mark Kerr, in the _Morning Post_, 13 Dec., 1920.\r\n\r\n[3] The _Daily Mail_, Aug. 13, 1920.\r\n\r\n[4] _Eleutheros Typos_, 5/18 Aug., 1920.\r\n\r\n[5] The _New Europe_, 29 March, 1917, p. 327.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Even if the Opposition sweeps the Peloponnese and gains a majority\r\nin Acarnania and Corfu, it is still doubtful whether it will have 120\r\nseats in the new Chamber, which will contain 369 Deputies; and the\r\nVenizelists anticipate that their opponents will emerge from the struggle\r\nwith less than 100 Deputies.\"--_The Times_, 15 Nov., 1920.\r\n\r\n[7] The _Daily Mail_; The _Evening News_, 16 Nov, 1920; Reuter, Athens,\r\n15 Nov.: \"Not a single Venizelist was returned for Macedonia and Old\r\nGreece, except in Epirus and Aegean Islands.\"\r\n\r\n[8] We learn that his followers \"urged upon him the advisability of a\r\n_coup d'état_.

International morality, strange as the\r\njuxtaposition of the two words may seem, exists no less than the law of\r\ngravity; and a statesman who offends against the one must expect much\r\nthe same catastrophe as an engineer who ignores the other.  But it is\r\nnot often that this law of retribution asserts itself so swiftly as it\r\nhas done in the drama for which Greece supplied the stage to French\r\nstatesmen during the last few years; for it is not often that a\r\nGovernment in the pursuit of practical interests overlooks so\r\ncompletely moral principles, flouts so openly national sentiments, and,\r\nwhile priding itself on realism, shuts its eyes so consistently to\r\nrealities.\r\n\r\nThe logic of French action is as above reproach, as its motives are\r\nbeyond dispute.\r\n\r\nNine decades ago the Duc de Broglie clearly explained that the aim of\r\nFrance in assisting to liberate Greece from the Turkish yoke was to\r\nhave in the Eastern Mediterranean an instrument of her own ambition: \"a\r\nState disposed to turn her eyes constantly towards that Power who has\r\nmade her free--to watch for us over the ports of the Levant, to guard\r\nwith us the mouth of the Black Sea and the keys of the Bosphorus\r\n[Transcriber's note: Bosporus?]\";--it followed that the greater the\r\nclient, the better for the patron's purpose.  After undergoing many\r\nfluctuations and modifications, this idea was revived at the time of\r\nthe Balkan wars, when France, together with Germany, supported the\r\nGreek claim to Cavalla, and it was fostered to an unhealthy growth\r\nduring the European War.  Hence the identification of France with M.\r\nVenizelos, who stood for a policy of expansion at all hazards, and her\r\nhostility to King Constantine who, preferring safety to hazardous\r\nventures, stood for Greece's right to shape her course without\r\ndictation from Paris any more than from Berlin.\r\n\r\n{231}\r\n\r\nBy the methods which she employed, France succeeded in gaining Greece\r\nand losing the Greeks.  Nothing else could have been expected: friends\r\nare sometimes to be won by good offices; sometimes by the promise of\r\ngood offices; and sometimes by good words.  They are seldom won by\r\ninjuries, and by insults never.  It is curious that so elementary a\r\nlesson in human nature should have been unknown to the able men who\r\nguided the policy and diplomacy of France during the War, who raised\r\nher military prestige and re-established her position in the first rank\r\nof the European Powers.  Yet it is a fact--a fact which can be easily\r\nverified by a reference to their utterances: they are upon record.\r\nBrute force, and brute force, and again brute force: such is the burden\r\nthat runs through them all; and it embodies a doctrine: the Greeks are\r\nOrientals and must be wooed with terror: on the notion, enunciated by\r\nan English humorist as a paradox, and adopted by French statesmen as an\r\naxiom, that terror sown in the Oriental heart will yield a harvest of\r\nesteem--even of affection.  With this mad dogma nailed to her mast,\r\nFrance set out upon her voyage for the conquest of the Hellenic heart.\r\nIt was the first of her mistakes--and it was accompanied by another.\r\n\r\nEven if Greece were willing to play the part of a French satellite, she\r\ncould not do so; for her geographical situation exposes her to the\r\ninfluence of more than one Power.  Italy, who has her own ambitions in\r\nthe Eastern Mediterranean, opposed during the War a policy the object\r\nof which was Greek expansion over territories coveted by herself and a\r\nreadjustment of the balance of forces in favour of France; and it was\r\npartly in order not to alienate Italy during the War that French\r\nstatesmen wanted Greece to come in without any specified conditions,\r\nleaving the matter of territorial compensations for the time of\r\nsettlement.  Russia showed herself not less suspicious of French\r\ndiplomacy for similar reasons.  But it was with England chiefly that\r\nFrance had to reckon.  In the past the rivalry between France and\r\nEngland in the Eastern Mediterranean, though often overshadowed by\r\ntheir common antagonism, first to Russia and subsequently to Germany,\r\nwas a perennial cause of discord which kept Greece oscillating between\r\nthe two Powers.\r\n\r\n{232}\r\n\r\nDuring the War England, of necessity, lent France her acquiescence and\r\neven assistance in a work which she would rather not have seen done.\r\nBut, once done, she endeavoured to secure such profit as was to be\r\nderived therefrom.  The Greeks in Asia Minor--it was thought--could\r\nserve to check the Turks from troubling us in Mesopotamia and other\r\nparts of the Near and Middle East.  Hence the Treaty of Sèvres, which\r\nprovided for the aggrandizement of Greece at the expense of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire in Asia as well as in Europe, to the seeming satisfaction of\r\nboth French and British interests.  But the adjustment--even if it had\r\nbeen forced upon Turkey--could, by the nature of things, be only\r\ntemporary.  Owing to her geographical situation, Greece must inevitably\r\nmove within the orbit of the Power who dominates the sea.\r\n\r\nPsychology accelerated a movement imposed by geography.  While France\r\nbased her action upon an English humorist's paradox, England based hers\r\nupon a French thinker's maxim:  _Lorsqu'on veut redoubler de force, il\r\nfaut redoubles de grâce_.  Although her diplomatic, military, and naval\r\nrepresentatives did participate in every measure of coercion and\r\nintimidation as a matter of policy, they (if we except the Secret\r\nService gentry) never forgot the dictates of decency: they never,\r\nfiguratively, kicked the person whom they deemed it necessary to knock\r\ndown.  The ordinary British soldiers, too, for all the relaxation of\r\nmoral rules natural in war, maintained throughout the campaign a\r\nstandard of behaviour which contrasted so favourably with their\r\ncomrades' that it earned them among the inhabitants of Macedonia the\r\nhonourable nickname of \"the maids.\"  It was particularly noted during\r\nthe fire which devastated Salonica that, while others took advantage of\r\nthe turmoil to loot, the British soldier devoted himself wholly to\r\nrescuing.  Some of these things were perhaps resented by our allies as\r\nweak, and some were ridiculed as naïve; but they must be judged by\r\ntheir effect.  At the end of the War one nation was respected by the\r\nGreeks as much as the other was hated and despised.  British prestige\r\nrose exactly in proportion as French prestige sank.  And the object\r\nwhich France elected to seek, and sought in vain, by {233} means of\r\nviolence and terror, England attained by a conduct which, if not more\r\nlawful, was much more graceful.\r\n\r\nStill, French statesmen counted on M. Venizelos--\"_l'homme politique\r\nqui incarne l'idée de la solidarité des intérêts français et\r\ngrecs_\"--to keep his country on their side.  And as in the first\r\ninstance they had made the alliance conditional on his being placed in\r\ncontrol, so now they made the benefits accruing from it to Greece\r\ndependent on his remaining in control.  That M. Venizelos could not\r\nalways remain in control does not seem to have occurred to them.  Nor\r\nthat he might not always be content to be a mere puppet in their hands.\r\nMurmurs at his pro-British leanings were indeed heard occasionally.\r\nBut on the whole the Cretan possessed in an adequate measure the\r\nfaculty of adapting himself to rival points of view, of making each\r\nPower feel that her interests were supreme in his regard, and of using\r\nthe ambitions of both to promote his own.  As long as he remained in\r\ncontrol, France, with whatever reservations, felt sure of her share of\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of M. Venizelos and the demand of the Greek people for\r\nKing Constantine's return, came to French statesmen as a painful\r\nsurprise.  That they had for several years been laboriously building on\r\nillusions could not be disguised, and being made to look absurd before\r\nthose of their own compatriots who had all along advocated a policy\r\nbased on the preservation and exploitation of Turkey, rendered the\r\nsituation doubly awkward.  Unable to rise above personal pique, they\r\nwould fain veto the return of a prince whom they hated and whom they\r\nhad wronged beyond hope of conciliation.  England, however, free from\r\npetty animosities, and sensible that, under whatever ruler, Greece\r\nwould be with her, refused to sanction lawlessness in the midst of\r\npeace; and her view that, if the Greeks wanted Constantine, it was\r\ntheir business and not ours, prevailed.  But, on the other hand, by way\r\nof compromise, France obtained that he should return to an empty\r\ntreasury, with foreign credits cut off, and the loans made by the\r\nAllies to the Venizelist Government, to facilitate the waging of a\r\ncommon war against Turkey, revoked.\r\n\r\nIt was an impossible position which King Constantine was called upon to\r\nface: a position none of his own making, {234} yet one from which there\r\nwas no retreat.  The Greek people's imperialism had been roused.  The\r\nleaders who once criticized M. Venizelos's Asiatic policy as a\r\ndangerous dream, opposed to economic, strategic, and ethnic realities,\r\nmight still hold those views and mutter in secret that Smyrna would\r\nprove the grave of Greece; but they no longer dared express them, out\r\nof deference to public opinion.  To the masses M. Venizelos's wild game\r\nof chance seemed vindicated by its results, and while they rejected the\r\nman they clung to his work.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Government had no choice but to carry on the conflict under\r\nenormous disadvantages.  As France anticipated, with foreign credits\r\ncut off and a progressive fall in the exchange, the expense of\r\nmaintaining a large army on a war footing proved too heavy for the\r\nNational Exchequer.  And that was not the worst.  France, who since the\r\nArmistice had betrayed a keen jealousy of England's place in a part of\r\nthe world in which she claims special rights, presently concluded a\r\nseparate agreement with Turkey--an example in which she was followed by\r\nItaly--and gave the Turks her moral and material support in their\r\nstruggle with the Greeks; while England, though refusing to reverse her\r\npolicy in favour of their enemies, contented herself with giving the\r\nGreeks only a platonic encouragement, which they were unwise enough to\r\ntake for more than it was worth.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows the melancholy sequel: our unhappy \"allies,\" left to\r\ntheir own exhausted resources, were driven from the Asiatic territories\r\nwhich in common prudence they should never have entered; and the\r\noverseas Empire which M. Venizelos had conjured up vanished in smoke.\r\n\r\nThe rout in Asia Minor had its repercussion in Greece.  For nearly two\r\nyears the people, though war-worn and on the edge of bankruptcy, bore\r\nthe financial as they had borne the famine blockade, trusting that\r\nEngland would at any moment come forth to counter the vindictiveness of\r\nFrance, and sturdily resisted all the efforts of the Venizelist party\r\nto shake the stability of the Royalist regime: Constantine again\r\nappeared in their eyes as a victim of the Cretan's intrigues.  But the\r\nloss of Ionia and the danger of the loss of Thrace; the horror and\r\n{235} despair arising from the sack of Smyrna, whence shiploads of\r\nbroken refugees fled to the Greek ports; all this, reinforced by an\r\nidea that the maintenance of the King on the throne prevented the\r\neffective expression of British friendship and his fall would remove\r\nFrench hostility, created conditions before which questions of\r\npersonalities for once faded into insignificance, and put into the\r\nhands of M. Venizelos's partisans an irresistible lever.\r\n\r\nOn 26 September an army of 15,000 insurgent soldiers landed near Athens\r\nand demanded the abdication of the King.  The loyal troops were ready\r\nto meet force by force.  But the King, in order to avert a fratricidal\r\nstruggle which would have dealt Greece the finishing stroke, forbade\r\nopposition and immediately abdicated, \"happy,\" as he said, \"that\r\nanother opportunity has been given me to sacrifice myself once more for\r\nGreece.\"  In fact, once more Constantine was made the scape-goat for\r\ndisasters for which he was in no way responsible--disasters from which\r\nhe would undoubtedly have saved his country, had he been allowed to\r\npursue his own sober course.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos would not go back to Athens until the excitement subsided,\r\nlest people should think, he said, that he had had any part in the\r\nrevolution: but undertook the defence of the national interests in the\r\nEntente capitals.  His mission was to obtain such support as would\r\nenable him to save Greece something out of the ruin which his insane\r\nimperialism had brought upon her, so that he might be in a position to\r\npoint out to his countrymen that he alone, after the disastrous failure\r\nof Constantine, had been able to secure their partial rehabilitation.\r\nThat accomplished, he might then hope to become a perpetual Prime\r\nMinister or President.\r\n\r\nFrance made it quite clear that no changes in Greece could alter her\r\npolicy: however satisfied she might be at the second disappearance of\r\nthe antipathetic monarch, it should not be supposed that, even were a\r\nRepublic to be set up, presided over by the Great Cretan, her attitude\r\non territorial questions would be transformed: Thrace, after Ionia,\r\nmust revert to Turkey.  French statesmen longed for the complete\r\ndemolition of their own handiwork.  M. Poincaré, in 1922, was proud to\r\ndo what the Duc de Broglie ninety years before scoffed at as an {236}\r\nunthinkable folly: \"_Abandonner la Grèce aujourd'hui, détruire de nos\r\npropres mains l'ouvrage que nos propres mains ont presque achevé!_\"\r\n\r\nEngland's expressed attitude was not characterized by a like precision.\r\nIt is true that after the Greek debacle she dispatched ships and troops\r\nto prevent the Straits from falling into the hands of the Turks; but in\r\nthe matter of Thrace she had already yielded to France: and how the\r\nrestoration of Turkish rule in Europe can be reconciled with the\r\nfreedom of the Straits remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nWhat the future may have in store for Greece and Turkey is a matter of\r\ncomparatively small account.  What is of great and permanent importance\r\nis the divergence between the paths of France and England revealed by\r\nthe preceding analysis of events.\r\n\r\nFrom this analysis have been carefully excluded such superficial\r\ndissensions as always arise between allies after a war, and were\r\nespecially to be expected after a war in which every national\r\nsusceptibility was quickened to a morbid degree: they belong to a\r\ndifferent category from the profound antagonisms under consideration.\r\nThese--whatever the philosopher may think of a struggle for\r\ndomination--present a problem which British statesmen must face\r\nfrankly.  It is not a new problem; but it now appears under a new form\r\nand in a more acute phase than it has ever possessed in the\r\npast--thanks to the success of the \"knock-out blow\" policy which\r\ngoverned the latter stages of the War.\r\n\r\nWith the German power replaced by the French, the Russian for the\r\nmoment in abeyance, French and Italian influences competing in Turkey,\r\nFrench and British aims clashing in the Arab regions wrested from\r\nTurkey--while indignation at Occidental interference surges in the\r\nminds of all the peoples of the Orient--the Eastern Mediterranean\r\noffers a situation which tempts one to ask whether the authors of that\r\npolicy have not succeeded too well?  Whether in pursuing the success of\r\nthe day--to which their personal reputations were attached--they did\r\nnot lose sight of the morrow?  Whether they have not scattered the seed\r\nwithout sufficiently heeding the crop?  However that may be, unless\r\nthis situation was clearly foreseen by its creators and provided for--a\r\nhypothesis {237} which, with the utmost goodwill towards them, does not\r\nappear very probable--they have an anxious task--a task that, under\r\nthese conditions, demands from British statesmanship more thinking\r\nabout the Near Eastern question and the Greek factor in it than was\r\nnecessary before 1914.\r\n\r\nAs a first aid to an appreciation of the problem by the public--which\r\nthe present crisis found utterly unprepared--it would have been well if\r\nthe fundamental differences between the respective attitudes of France\r\nand England towards each other and towards the peoples concerned had\r\nbeen candidly acknowledged, and all pretence of Franco-British\r\nco-operation in the Near East abandoned.  Lasting co-operation cannot\r\nbe where there is neither community of interests nor consonance of\r\nideas: where the loss of one party is welcomed as gain by the other,\r\nand the wisdom of the one in the eyes of the other is folly.  Pious\r\ntalk of a common Allied mission in the Near East has only served to\r\nobscure issues and to render confusion in the public mind worse\r\nconfounded.  It was idle to make a mystery of the support given by\r\nFrance to the Turks and of her insistence on the revision of the Sèvres\r\nTreaty--preliminary steps to her demand for the evacuation of Chanak\r\nand the consequent elimination of British sea-power.  The object of\r\nthese tactics was evident to every serious student of history: France\r\npursues now the plan laid down by Louis XIV, continued by Napoleon,\r\nfitfully carried on throughout the nineteenth century, and facilitated\r\nby her installation in Syria--the equivalent of the German _Drang nach\r\nOsten_: a plan incompatible with the safety of the British Empire in\r\nthe East.  This is the truth of the matter, and nothing has been gained\r\nby hiding it.\r\n\r\nThe people who fought a ruinous war without quite knowing the ends\r\naimed at, had a right to know at least the results obtained; and after\r\nFrance's separate agreement with Turkey, the denial to them of any part\r\nof that knowledge could not be justified on any principle of honour or\r\nplea of expediency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{239}\r\n\r\n  INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Achilleion, 92\r\n  Albania, Suggested partition of, 19\r\n  Alexander, King, 197, 203, 205-7, 219, 224\r\n  Andrew, Prince, 123, 200\r\n  Asia Minor, Concessions to Greece in, 19, 22-26, 32, 34, 35, 37,\r\n    221, 232.\r\n  ---- ----, Greeks driven from, 234\r\n  Athens, Naval demonstrations against, 82, 102, 110, 111\r\n  ----, Fighting at, 159-161\r\n  ----, Bombardment of, 160\r\n  ----, Occupation of, 204\r\n  ----, Conspiracy at, 216\r\n  ----, Riots at, 221, 222\r\n  ---- electorate, 223\r\n  Austria and Greece, 9\r\n  ---- and Servia, 7, 17, 22\r\n  Averoff, M., 183\r\n  ---- gaol, 209\r\n\r\n  Balkan League, 4, 19, 20, 24, 27\r\n  Benazet, M., Negotiation of, 146, 147, 150-152\r\n  Blockades, 82, 101, 164, 172-176, 184\r\n  Boulogne, Conference at, 140, 185\r\n  Bratiano, M., 22\r\n  Briand, M., 76, 86, 89, 100-103, 105, 116, 131, 132, 146\r\n  Broglie, Due de, 188, 230, 235\r\n  Bucharest Treaty, 7-9, 18\r\n  ----, Conference at, 18\r\n  Bulgaria and Greece, 7, 8, 21, 23, 67\r\n  ---- ---- Servia, 7, 17, 21, 62\r\n  ---- ---- Turkey, 21, 52\r\n  ---- ---- Central Powers, 27, 40\r\n  ---- ---- Entente, 21, 28, 38, 40, 43, 57, 60, 66, 144\r\n  Bülow, Prince von, 47\r\n\r\n  Callimassiotis, M., 92\r\n  Calogeropoulos, M., Premier, 124-132, 140, 192\r\n  Canea, 92, 128, 130, 132\r\n  Castellorizo, 85, 86\r\n  Castoria, Metropolitan of, 209\r\n  Cavalla allotted to Greece, 10, 230\r\n  ----, Proposed cession of, to   Bulgaria.  20, 23-25, 39, 41-42\r\n  ---- surrendered to Germano-Bulgars, 118-21\r\n  Cephalonia, 86, 177\r\n  Cerigo, 177\r\n  Chanak, 237\r\n  Chios, 130\r\n  Church, Greek, 175, 176, 208, 209\r\n  Churchill, Mr. Winston, 13\r\n  Cochin, M.
