The world has\r\nsympathized with us; the world abroad has given aid and comfort to our\r\nrefugees; the world, at times, even admired us; yet the world has not\r\nknown us. Friends of freedom in Europe and America were keenly anxious\r\nto see the victory of our cause; they watched our successes and our\r\ndefeats with breathless interest; yet they were concerned with material\r\nresults. Our views, our party affiliations, our factional divisions, our\r\ntheoretical gropings, our ideological constructions, to us the leading\r\nlights in our revolutionary struggles, were foreign to the world. All\r\nthis was supposed to be an internal Russian affair.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution has now ceased to be an internal Russian affair. It has\r\nbecome of world-wide import. It has started to influence governments and\r\npeoples. What was not long ago a theoretical dispute between two\r\n\"underground\" revolutionary circles, has grown into a concrete\r\nhistorical power determining the fate of nations. What was the\r\nindividual conception of individual revolutionary leaders is now ruling\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThe world is now vitally interested in understanding Russia, in learning\r\nthe history of our Revolution which is the history of the great Russian\r\nnation for the last fifty years. This involves, however, knowing not\r\nonly events, but also the development of thoughts, of aims, of ideas\r\nthat underlie and direct events; gaining an insight into the immense\r\nvolume of intellectual work which recent decades have accumulated in\r\nrevolutionary Russia.\r\n\r\nWe have selected Leon Trotzky's contribution to revolutionary thought,\r\nnot because he is now in the limelight of history, but because his\r\nconceptions represent a very definite, a clear-cut and intrinsically\r\nconsistent trend of revolutionary thought, quite apart from that of\r\nother leaders. We do not agree with many of Trotzky's ideas and\r\npolicies, yet we cannot overlook the fact that these ideas have become\r\npredominant in the present phase of the Russian Revolution and that they\r\nare bound to give their stamp to Russian democracy in the years to come,\r\nwhether the present government remains in power or not.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see that Trotzky's views as applied in Bolsheviki ruled\r\nRussia are not of recent origin. They were formed in the course of the\r\nFirst Russian Revolution of 1905, in which Trotzky was one of the\r\nleaders. They were developed and strengthened in the following years of\r\nreaction, when many a progressive group went to seek compromises with\r\nthe absolutist forces. They became particularly firm through the world\r\nwar and the circumstances that led to the establishment of a republican\r\norder in Russia. Perhaps many a grievous misunderstanding and\r\nmisinterpretation would have been avoided had thinking America known\r\nthat those conceptions of Trotzky were not created on the spur of the\r\nmoment, but were the result of a life-long work in the service of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nTrotzky's writings, besides their theoretical and political value,\r\nrepresent a vigor of style and a clarity of expression unique in Russian\r\nrevolutionary literature.\r\n\r\nM.J.

He is tall, strong, angular; his\r\nappearance as well as his speech give the impression of boldness and\r\nvigor. His voice is a high tenor ringing with metal. And even in his\r\nquiet moments he resembles a compressed spring.\r\n\r\nHe is always aggressive. He is full of passion,--that white-hot,\r\nvibrating mental passion that characterizes the intellectual Jew. On the\r\nplatform, as well as in private life, he bears an air of peculiar\r\nimportance, an indefinable something that says very distinctly: \"Here is\r\na man who knows his value and feels himself chosen for superior aims.\"\r\nYet Trotzky is not imposing. He is almost modest. He is detached. In the\r\ndepths of his eyes there is a lingering sadness.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural that he, a gifted college youth with a strong\r\navidity for theoretical thinking, should have exchanged, some twenty\r\nyears ago, the somber class-rooms of the University of Odessa for the\r\nfresh breezes of revolutionary activity. That was the way of most gifted\r\nRussian youths. That especially was the way of educated young Jews whose\r\npeople were being crushed under the steam-roller of the Russian\r\nbureaucracy.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of the nineteenth century there was hardly enough\r\nopportunity to display unusual energy in revolutionary work. Small\r\ncircles of picked workingmen, assembling weekly under great secrecy\r\nsomewhere in a backyard cabin in a suburb, to take a course in sociology\r\nor history or economics; now and then a \"mass\" meeting of a few score\r\nlaborers gathered in the woods; revolutionary appeals and pamphlets\r\nprinted on a secret press and circulated both among the educated classes\r\nand among the people; on rare occasions, an open manifestation of\r\nrevolutionary intellectuals, such as a meeting of students within the\r\nwalls of the University--this was practically all that could be done in\r\nthose early days of Russian revolution. Into this work of preparation,\r\nTrotzky threw himself with all his energy. Here he came into the closest\r\ncontact with the masses of labor. Here he acquainted himself with the\r\npsychology and aspirations of working and suffering Russia. This was the\r\nrich soil of practical experience that ever since has fed his\r\nrevolutionary ardor.\r\n\r\nHis first period of work was short. In 1900 we find him already in\r\nsolitary confinement in the prisons of Odessa, devouring book after book\r\nto satisfy his mental hunger. No true revolutionist was ever made\r\ndownhearted by prison, least of all Trotzky, who knew it was a brief\r\ninterval of enforced idleness between periods of activity. After two and\r\na half years of prison \"vacation\" (as the confinement was called in\r\nrevolutionary jargon) Trotzky was exiled to Eastern Siberia, to Ust-Kut,\r\non the Lena River, where he arrived early in 1902, only to seize the\r\nfirst opportunity to escape.\r\n\r\nAgain he resumed his work, dividing his time between the revolutionary\r\ncommittees in Russia and the revolutionary colonies abroad. 1902 and\r\n1903 were years of growth for the labor movement and of\r\nSocial-Democratic influence over the working masses. Trotzky, an\r\nuncompromising Marxist, an outspoken adherent of the theory that only\r\nthe revolutionary workingmen would be able to establish democracy in\r\nRussia, devoted much of his energy to the task of uniting the various\r\nSocial-Democratic circles and groups in the various cities of Russia\r\ninto one strong Social-Democratic Party, with a clear program and\r\nwell-defined tactics. This required a series of activities both among\r\nthe local committees and in the Social-Democratic literature which was\r\nconveniently published abroad.\r\n\r\nIt was in connection with this work that Trotzky's first pamphlet was\r\npublished and widely read. It was entitled: _The Second Convention of\r\nThe Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party_ (Geneva, 1903), and dealt\r\nwith the controversies between the two factions of Russian\r\nSocial-Democracy which later became known as the Bolsheviki and the\r\nMensheviki. Trotzky's contribution was an attempt at reconciliation\r\nbetween the two warring camps which professed the same Marxian theory\r\nand pursued the same revolutionary aim. The attempt failed, as did many\r\nothers, yet Trotzky never gave up hope of uniting the alienated\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Revolution of 1905, Trotzky was already a\r\nrevolutionary journalist of high repute. We admired the vigor of his\r\nstyle, the lucidity of his thought and the straightness of his\r\nexpression. Articles bearing the pseudonym \"N. Trotzky\" were an\r\nintellectual treat, and invariably aroused heated discussions. It may\r\nnot be out of place to say a few words about this pseudonym. Many an\r\namazing comment has been made in the American press on the Jew Bronstein\r\n\"camouflaging\" under a Russian name, Trotzky. It seems to be little\r\nknown in this country that to assume a pen name is a practice widely\r\nfollowed in Russia, not only among revolutionary writers. Thus \"Gorki\"\r\nis a pseudonym; \"Shchedrin\" (Saltykov) is a pseudonym. \"Fyodor Sologub\"\r\nis a pseudonym. As to revolutionary writers, the very character of their\r\nwork has compelled them to hide their names to escape the secret police.\r\nUlyanov, therefore, became \"Lenin,\" and Bronstein became \"Trotzky.\" As\r\nto his \"camouflaging\" as a Russian, this assertion is based on sheer\r\nignorance. Trotzky is not a genuine Russian name--no more so than\r\nOstrovski or Levine. True, there was a Russian playwright Ostrovski, and\r\nTolstoi gave his main figure in _Anna Karenin_ the name of Levine. Yet\r\nOstrovski and Levine are well known in Russia as Jewish names, and so is\r\nTrotzky. I have never heard of a Gentile bearing the name Trotzky.\r\nTrotzky has never concealed his Jewish nationality. He was too proud to\r\ndissimulate. Pride is, perhaps, one of the dominant traits of his\r\npowerful personality.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary Russia did not question the race or nationality of a\r\nwriter or leader. One admired Trotzky's power over emotion, the depth of\r\nhis convictions, the vehemence of his attacks on the opponents of the\r\nRevolution. As early as 1904, one line of his revolutionary conceptions\r\nbecame quite conspicuous: _his opposition to the liberal movement in\r\nRussia_. In a series of essays in the Social-Democratic _Iskra_\r\n(_Spark_), in a collection of his essays published in Geneva under the\r\ntitle _Before January Ninth_, he unremittingly branded the Liberals for\r\nlack of revolutionary spirit, for cowardice in face of a hateful\r\nautocracy, for failure to frame and to defend a thoroughly democratic\r\nprogram, for readiness to compromise with the rulers on minor\r\nconcessions and thus to betray the cause of the Revolution. No one else\r\nwas as eloquent, as incisive in pointing out the timidity and meekness\r\nof the Zemstvo opposition (Zemstvo were the local representative bodies\r\nfor the care of local affairs, and the Liberal land owners constituted\r\nthe leading party in those bodies) as the young revolutionary agitator,\r\nTrotzky. Trotzky's fury against the wavering policy of the well-to-do\r\nLiberals was only a manifestation of another trait of his character:\r\n_his desire for clarity in political affairs_. Trotzky could not\r\nconceive of half-way measures, of \"diplomatic\" silence over vital\r\ntopics, of cunning moves and concealed designs in political struggles.\r\nThe attitude of a Milukov, criticizing the government and yet willing to\r\nacquiesce in a monarchy of a Prussian brand, criticizing the\r\nrevolutionists and yet secretly pleased with the horror they inflicted\r\nupon Romanoff and his satellites, was simply incompatible with Trotzky's\r\nvery nature and aroused his impassioned contempt. To him, black was\r\nalways black, and white was white, and political conceptions ought to be\r\nso clear as to find adequate expression in a few simple phrases.\r\n\r\nTrotzky's own political line was the Revolution--a violent uprising of\r\nthe masses, headed by organized labor, forcibly to overthrow bureaucracy\r\nand establish democratic freedom. With what an outburst of blazing joy\r\nhe greeted the upheaval of January 9, 1905--the first great\r\nmass-movement in Russia with clear political aims: \"The Revolution has\r\ncome!\" he shouted in an ecstatic essay completed on January 20th. \"The\r\nRevolution has come. One move of hers has lifted the people over scores\r\nof steps, up which in times of peace we would have had to drag ourselves\r\nwith hardships and fatigue. The Revolution has come and destroyed the\r\nplans of so many politicians who had dared to make their little\r\npolitical calculations with no regard for the master, the revolutionary\r\npeople. The Revolution has come and destroyed scores of superstitions,\r\nand has manifested the power of the program which is founded on the\r\nrevolutionary logic of the development of the masses.... The Revolution\r\nhas come and the period of our infancy has passed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Revolution filled the entire year of 1905 with the battle cries of\r\never-increasing revolutionary masses. The political strike became a\r\npowerful weapon. The village revolts spread like wild-fire. The\r\ngovernment became frightened. It was under the sign of this great\r\nconflagration that Trotzky framed his theory of _immediate transition\r\nfrom absolutism to a Socialist order_. His line of argument was very\r\nsimple. The working class, he wrote, was the only real revolutionary\r\npower. The bourgeoisie was weak and incapable of adroit resistance. The\r\nintellectual groups were of no account. The peasantry was politically\r\nprimitive, yet it had an overwhelming desire for land. \"Once the\r\nRevolution is victorious, political power necessarily passes into the\r\nhands of the class that has played a leading role in the struggle, and\r\nthat is the working class.\" To secure permanent power, the working class\r\nwould have to win over the millions of peasants. This would be possible\r\nby recognizing all the agrarian changes completed by the peasants in\r\ntime of the revolution and by a radical agrarian legislation. \"Once in\r\npower, the proletariat will appear before the peasantry as its\r\nliberator.\" On the other hand, having secured its class rule over\r\nRussia, why should the proletariat help to establish parliamentary rule,\r\nwhich is the rule of the bourgeois classes over the people? \"To imagine\r\nthat Social-Democracy participates in the Provisional Government,\r\nplaying a leading role in the period of revolutionary democratic\r\nreconstruction, insisting on the most radical reforms and all the time\r\nenjoying the aid and support of the organized proletariat,--only to step\r\naside when the democratic program is put into operation, to leave the\r\ncompleted building at the disposal of the bourgeois parties and thus to\r\nopen an era of parliamentary politics where Social-Democracy forms only\r\na party of opposition,--to imagine this would mean to compromise the\r\nvery idea of a labor government.\" Moreover, \"once the representatives of\r\nthe proletariat enter the government, not as powerless hostages, but as\r\na leading force, the divide between the minimum-program and the\r\nmaximum-program automatically disappears, collectivism becomes the order\r\nof the day,\" since \"political supremacy of the proletariat is\r\nincompatible with its economic slavery.\" It was precisely the same\r\nprogram which Trotzky is at present attempting to put into operation.\r\nThis program has been his guiding star for the last twelve years.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1905 it looked as if Trotzky's hope was near its\r\nrealization. The October strike brought autocracy to its knees. A\r\nConstitution was promised. A Soviet (Council of Workmen's Deputies) was\r\nformed in Petersburg to conduct the Revolution. Trotzky became one of\r\nthe strongest leaders of the Council. It was in those months that we\r\nbecame fully aware of two qualities of Trotzky's which helped him to\r\nmaster men: his power as a speaker, and his ability to write short,\r\nstirring articles comprehensible to the masses. In the latter ability\r\nnobody equals him among Russian Socialists. The leaders of Russian\r\nSocial-Democracy were wont to address themselves to the intellectual\r\nreaders. Socialist writers of the early period of the Revolution were\r\nseldom confronted with the necessity of writing for plain people.\r\nTrotzky was the best among the few who, in the stormy months of the 1905\r\nrevolution, were able to appeal to the masses in brief, strong, yet\r\ndignified articles full of thought, vision, and emotion.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet was struggling in a desperate situation. Autocracy had\r\npromised freedom, yet military rule was becoming ever more atrocious.\r\nThe sluices of popular revolutionary movement were open, yet\r\nrevolutionary energy was being gradually exhausted. The Soviet acted as\r\na true revolutionary government, ignoring the government of the\r\nRomanoffs, giving orders to the workingmen of the country, keeping a\r\nwatchful eye on political events; yet the government of the old regime\r\nwas regaining its self-confidence and preparing for a final blow. The\r\nair was full of bad omens.\r\n\r\nIt required an unusual degree of revolutionary faith and vigor to\r\nconduct the affairs of the Soviet. Trotzky was the man of the hour.\r\nFirst a member of the Executive Committee, then the chairman of the\r\nSoviet, he was practically in the very vortex of the Revolution. He\r\naddressed meetings, he ordered strikes, he provided the vanguard of the\r\nworkingmen with firearms; he held conferences with representatives of\r\nlabor unions throughout the country, and--the irony of history--he\r\nrepeatedly appeared before the Ministers of the old regime as a\r\nrepresentative of labor democracy to demand from them the release of a\r\nprisoner or the abolition of some measures obnoxious to labor. It was in\r\nthis school of the Soviet that Trotzky learned to see events in a\r\nnational aspect, and it was the very existence of the Soviet which\r\nconfirmed his belief in the possibility of a revolutionary proletarian\r\ndictatorship. Looking backward at the activities of the Soviet, he thus\r\ncharacterized that prototype of the present revolutionary government in\r\nRussia. \"The Soviet,\" he wrote, \"was the organized authority of the\r\nmasses themselves over their separate members. This was a true,\r\nunadulterated democracy, without a two-chamber system, without a\r\nprofessional bureaucracy, with the right of the voters to recall their\r\nrepresentative at will and to substitute another.\" In short, it was the\r\nsame type of democracy Trotzky and Lenin are trying to make permanent in\r\npresent-day Russia.\r\n\r\nThe black storm soon broke loose. Trotzky was arrested with the other\r\nmembers of the \"revolutionary government,\" after the Soviet had existed\r\nfor about a month and a half. Trotzky went to prison, not in despair,\r\nbut as a leader of an invincible army which though it had suffered\r\ntemporary defeat, was bound to win. Trotzky had to wait twelve years for\r\nthe moment of triumph, yet the moment came.\r\n\r\nIn prison Trotzky was very active, reading, writing, trying to sum up\r\nhis experience of the revolutionary year. After twelve months of\r\nsolitary confinement he was tried and sentenced to life exile in\r\nSiberia: the government of the enemies of the people was wreaking\r\nvengeance on the first true representatives of the people. On January 3,\r\n1907, Trotzky started his trip for Obdorsk, in Northern Siberia on the\r\nArctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nHe was under unusual rigid surveillance even for Russian prisons. Each\r\nmovement of his and of his comrades was carefully guarded. No\r\ncommunication with the outer world was permitted. The very journey was\r\nsurrounded by great secrecy. Yet such was the fame of the Soviet, that\r\ncrowds gathered at every station to greet the prisoners' train, and even\r\nthe soldiers showed extraordinary respect for the imprisoned\r\n\"workingmen's deputies\" as they called them. \"We are surrounded by\r\nfriends on every side,\" Trotzky wrote in his note book.\r\n\r\nIn Tiumen the prisoners had to leave the railway train for sleighs\r\ndrawn by horses. The journey became very tedious and slow. The monotony\r\nwas broken only by little villages, where revolutionary exiles were\r\ndetained. Here and there the exiles would gather to welcome the leaders\r\nof the revolution. Red flags gave touches of color to the blinding white\r\nof the Siberian snow. \"Long live the Revolution!\" was printed with huge\r\nletters on the surface of the northern snow, along the road. This was\r\nbeautiful, but it gave little consolation. The country became ever more\r\ndesolate. \"Every day we move down one step into the kingdom of cold and\r\nwilderness,\" Trotzky remarked in his notes.\r\n\r\nIt was a gloomy prospect, to spend years and years in this God forsaken\r\ncountry. Trotzky was not the man to submit. In defiance of difficulties,\r\nhe managed to escape before he reached the town of his destination. As\r\nthere was only one road along which travelers could move, and as there\r\nwas danger that authorities, notified by wire of his escape, could stop\r\nhim at any moment, he left the road and on a sleigh drawn by reindeer he\r\ncrossed an unbroken wilderness of 800 versts, over 500 miles. This\r\nrequired great courage and physical endurance. The picturesque journey\r\nis described by Trotzky in a beautiful little book, _My Round Trip_.\r\n\r\nIt was in this Ostiak sleigh, in the midst of a bleak desert, that he\r\ncelebrated the 20th of February, the day of the opening of the Second\r\nDuma. It was a mockery at Russia: here, the representatives of the\r\npeople, assembled in the quasi-Parliament of Russia; there, a\r\nrepresentative of the Revolution that created the Duma, hiding like a\r\ncriminal in a bleak wilderness. Did he dream in those long hours of his\r\njourney, that some day the wave of the Revolution would bring him to the\r\nvery top?\r\n\r\nEarly in spring he arrived abroad. He established his home in Vienna\r\nwhere he lived till the outbreak of the great war. His time and energy\r\nwere devoted to the internal affairs of the Social-Democratic Party and\r\nto editing a popular revolutionary magazine which was being smuggled\r\ninto Russia. He earned a meager living by contributing to Russian\r\n\"legal\" magazines and dailies.\r\n\r\nI met him first in 1907, in Stuttgart. He seemed to be deeply steeped in\r\nthe revolutionary factional squabbles. Again I met him in Copenhagen in\r\n1910. He was the target of bitter criticism for his press-comment on one\r\nof the Social-Democratic factions. He seemed to be dead to anything but\r\nthe problem of reconciling the Bolsheviki with the Mensheviki and the\r\nother minor divisions. Yet that air of importance which distinguished\r\nhim even from the famous old leaders had, in 1910, become more apparent.\r\nBy this time he was already a well-known and respected figure in the\r\nranks of International Socialism.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1912 he went into the Balkans as a war correspondent.\r\nThere he learned to know the Balkan situation from authentic sources.\r\nHis revelations of the atrocities committed on both sides attracted wide\r\nattention. When he came back to Vienna in 1913 he was a stronger\r\ninternationalist and a stronger anti-militarist than ever.\r\n\r\nHis house in Vienna was a poor man's house, poorer than that of an\r\nordinary American workingman earning eighteen dollars a week. Trotzky\r\nhas been poor all his life. His three rooms in a Vienna working-class\r\nsuburb contained less furniture than was necessary for comfort. His\r\nclothes were too cheap to make him appear \"decent\" in the eyes of a\r\nmiddle-class Viennese. When I visited his house I found Mrs. Trotzky\r\nengaged in housework, while the two light-haired lovely boys were\r\nlending not inconsiderable assistance. The only thing that cheered the\r\nhouse were loads of books in every corner, and, perhaps, great though\r\nhidden hopes.\r\n\r\nOn August 3, 1914, the Trotzkys, as enemy aliens, had to leave Vienna\r\nfor Zurich, Switzerland. Trotzky's attitude towards the war was a very\r\ndefinite one from the very beginning. He accused German Social-Democracy\r\nfor having voted the war credits and thus endorsed the war. He accused\r\nthe Socialist parties of all the belligerent countries for having\r\nconcluded a truce with their governments which in his opinion was\r\nequivalent to supporting militarism. He bitterly deplored the collapse\r\nof Internationalism as a great calamity for the emancipation of the\r\nworld. Yet, even in those times of distress, he did not remain inactive.\r\nHe wrote a pamphlet to the German workingmen entitled _The War and\r\nInternationalism_ (recently translated into English and published in\r\nthis country under the title _The Bolsheviki and World Peace_) which was\r\nillegally transported into Germany and Austria by aid of Swiss\r\nSocialists. For this attempt to enlighten the workingmen, one of the\r\nGerman courts tried him in a state of contumacy and sentenced him to\r\nimprisonment. He also contributed to a Russian Socialist daily of\r\nInternationalist aspirations which was being published by Russian\r\nexiles in Paris. Later he moved to Paris to be in closer contact with\r\nthat paper. Due to his radical views on the war, however, he was\r\ncompelled to leave France. He went to Spain, but the Spanish government,\r\nthough not at war, did not allow him to stay in that country. He was\r\nhimself convinced that the hand of the Russian Foreign Ministry was in\r\nall his hardships.\r\n\r\nSo it happened that in the winter 1916-1917, he came to the United\r\nStates. When I met him here, he looked haggard; he had grown older, and\r\nthere was fatigue in his expression. His conversation hinged around the\r\ncollapse of International Socialism. He thought it shameful and\r\nhumiliating that the Socialist majorities of the belligerent countries\r\nhad turned \"Social-Patriots.\" \"If not for the minorities of the\r\nSocialist parties, the true Socialists, it would not be worth while\r\nliving,\" he said once with deep sadness. Still, he strongly believed in\r\nthe internationalizing spirit of the war itself, and expected humanity\r\nto become more democratic and more sound after cessation of hostilities.\r\nHis belief in an impending Russian Revolution was unshaken. Similarly\r\nunshaken was his mistrust of the Russian non-Socialist parties. On\r\nJanuary 20, 1917, less than two months before the overthrow of the\r\nRomanoffs, he wrote in a local Russian paper: \"Whoever thinks critically\r\nover the experience of 1905, whoever draws a line from that year to the\r\npresent day, must conceive how utterly lifeless and ridiculous are the\r\nhopes of our Social-Patriots for a revolutionary cooeperation between the\r\nproletariat and the Liberal bourgeoisie in Russia.\"\r\n\r\nHis demand for _clarity_ in political affairs had become more pronounced\r\nduring the war and through the distressing experiences of the war.\r\n\"There are times,\" he wrote on February 7, 1917, \"when diplomatic\r\nevasiveness, casting glances with one eye to the right, with the other\r\nto the left, is considered wisdom. Such times are now vanishing before\r\nour eyes, and their heroes are losing credit. War, as revolution, puts\r\nproblems in their clearest form. For war or against war? For national\r\ndefense or for revolutionary struggle? The fierce times we are living\r\nnow demand in equal measure both fearlessness of thought and bravery of\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Russian Revolution broke out, it was no surprise for Trotzky.\r\nHe had anticipated it. He had scented it over the thousands of miles\r\nthat separated him from his country. He did not allow his joy to\r\novermaster him. The March revolution in his opinion was only a\r\nbeginning. It was only an introduction to a long drawn fight which would\r\nend in the establishment of Socialism.\r\n\r\nHistory seemed to him to have fulfilled what he had predicted in 1905\r\nand 1906. The working class was the leading power in the Revolution. The\r\nSoviets became even more powerful than the Provisional Government.\r\nTrotzky preached that it was the task of the Soviets to become _the_\r\ngovernment of Russia. It was his task to go to Russia and fight for a\r\nlabor government, for Internationalism, for world peace, for a world\r\nrevolution. \"If the first Russian revolution of 1905,\" he wrote on March\r\n20th, \"brought about revolutions in Asia,--in Persia, Turkey,\r\nChina,--the second Russian revolution will be the beginning of a\r\nmomentous Social-revolutionary struggle in Europe. Only this struggle\r\nwill bring real peace to the blood-drenched world.\"\r\n\r\nWith these hopes he went to Russia,--to forge a Socialist Russia in the\r\nfire of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be our opinion of the merits of his policies, the man has\r\nremained true to himself. His line has been straight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROLETARIAT AND THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n     The essay _The Proletariat and the Revolution_ was published at the\r\n     close of 1904, nearly one year after the beginning of the war with\r\n     Japan. This was a crucial year for the autocratic rulers of Russia.\r\n     It started with patriotic demonstrations, it ended with a series of\r\n     humiliating defeats on the battlefields and with an unprecedented\r\n     revival of political activities on the part of the well-to-do\r\n     classes. The Zemstvos (local elective bodies for the care of local\r\n     affairs) headed by liberal landowners, conducted a vigorous\r\n     political campaign in favor of a constitutional order. Other\r\n     liberal groups, organizations of professionals (referred to in\r\n     Trotzky's essay as \"democrats\" and \"democratic elements\") joined in\r\n     the movement. The Zemstvo leaders called an open convention in\r\n     Petersburg (November 6th), which demanded civic freedom and a\r\n     Constitution. The \"democratic elements\" organized public gatherings\r\n     of a political character under the disguise of private banquets.\r\n     The liberal press became bolder in its attack on the\r\n     administration. The government tolerated the movement. Prince\r\n     Svyatopolk-Mirski, who had succeeded Von Plehve, the reactionary\r\n     dictator assassinated in July, 1904, by a revolutionist, had\r\n     promised \"cordial relations\" between government and society. In the\r\n     political jargon, this period of tolerance, lasting from August to\r\n     the end of the year, was known as the era of \"Spring.\"\r\n\r\n     It was a thrilling time, full of political hopes and expectation.\r\n     Yet, strange enough, the working class was silent. The working\r\n     class had shown great dissatisfaction in 1902 and especially in\r\n     summer, 1903, when scores of thousands in the southwest and in the\r\n     South went on a political strike. During the whole of 1904,\r\n     however, there were almost no mass-manifestations on the part of\r\n     the workingmen. This gave an occasion to many a liberal to scoff at\r\n     the representatives of the revolutionary parties who built all\r\n     their tactics on the expectation of a national revolution.\r\n\r\n     To answer those skeptics and to encourage the active members of the\r\n     Social-Democratic party, Trotzky wrote his essay. Its main value,\r\n     which lends it historic significance, is the clear diagnosis of the\r\n     political situation. Though living abroad, Trotzky keenly felt the\r\n     pulse of the masses, the \"pent up revolutionary energy\" which was\r\n     seeking for an outlet. His description of the course of a national\r\n     revolution, the role he attributes to the workingmen, the\r\n     non-proletarian population of the cities, the educated groups, and\r\n     the army; his estimation of the influence of the war on the minds\r\n     of the raw masses; finally, the slogans he puts before the\r\n     revolution,--all this corresponds exactly to what happened during\r\n     the stormy year of 1905. Reading _The Proletariat and the\r\n     Revolution_, the student of Russian political life has a feeling\r\n     as if the essay had been written _after_ the Revolution, so closely\r\n     it follows the course of events. Yet, it appeared before January\r\n     9th, 1905, i.e., before the first great onslaught of the Petersburg\r\n     proletariat.\r\n\r\n     Trotzky's belief in the revolutionary initiative of the working\r\n     class could not be expressed in a more lucid manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proletariat must not only conduct a revolutionary propaganda. The\r\nproletariat itself must move towards a revolution.\r\n\r\nTo move towards a revolution does not necessarily mean to fix a date for\r\nan insurrection and to prepare for that day. You never can fix a day and\r\nan hour for a revolution. The people have never made a revolution by\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nWhat _can_ be done is, in view of the fatally impending catastrophe, to\r\nchoose the most appropriate positions, to arm and inspire the masses\r\nwith a revolutionary slogan, to lead simultaneously all the reserves\r\ninto the field of battle, to make them practice in the art of fighting,\r\nto keep them ready under arms,--and to send an alarm all over the lines\r\nwhen the time has arrived.\r\n\r\nWould that mean a series of exercises only, and not a decisive combat\r\nwith the enemy forces? Would that be mere manoeuvers, and not a street\r\nrevolution?\r\n\r\nYes, that would be mere manoeuvers. There is a difference, however,\r\nbetween revolutionary and military manoeuvers. Our preparations can\r\nturn, at any time and independent of our will, into a real battle which\r\nwould decide the long drawn revolutionary war. Not only can it be so, it\r\n_must_ be. This is vouched for by the acuteness of the present political\r\nsituation which holds in its depths a tremendous amount of revolutionary\r\nexplosives.\r\n\r\nAt what time mere manoeuvers would turn into a real battle, depends\r\nupon the volume and the revolutionary compactness of the masses, upon\r\nthe atmosphere of popular sympathy which surrounds them and upon the\r\nattitude of the troops which the government moves against the people.\r\n\r\nThose three elements of success must determine our work of preparation.\r\nRevolutionary proletarian masses _are_ in existence. We ought to be able\r\nto call them into the streets, at a given time, all over the country; we\r\nought to be able to unite them by a general slogan.\r\n\r\nAll classes and groups of the people are permeated with hatred towards\r\nabsolutism, and that means with sympathy for the struggle for freedom.\r\nWe ought to be able to concentrate this sympathy on the proletariat as a\r\nrevolutionary power which alone can be the vanguard of the people in\r\ntheir fight to save the future of Russia. As to the mood of the army, it\r\nhardly kindles the heart of the government with great hopes. There has\r\nbeen many an alarming symptom for the last few years; the army is\r\nmorose, the army grumbles, there are ferments of dissatisfaction in the\r\narmy. We ought to do all at our command to make the army detach itself\r\nfrom absolutism at the time of a decisive onslaught of the masses.\r\n\r\nLet us first survey the last two conditions, which determine the course\r\nand the outcome of the campaign.\r\n\r\nWe have just gone through the period of \"political renovation\" opened\r\nunder the blare of trumpets and closed under the hiss of knouts,--the\r\nera of Svyatopolk-Mirski--the result of which is hatred towards\r\nabsolutism aroused among all the thinking elements of society to an\r\nunusual pitch. The coming days will reap the fruit of stirred popular\r\nhopes and unfulfilled government's pledges. Political interest has\r\nlately taken more definite shape; dissatisfaction has grown deeper and\r\nis founded on a more outspoken theoretical basis. Popular thinking,\r\nyesterday utterly primitive, now greedily takes to the work of political\r\nanalysis. All manifestations of evil and arbitrary power are being\r\nspeedily traced back to the principal cause. Revolutionary slogans no\r\nmore frighten the people; on the contrary, they arouse a thousandfold\r\necho, they pass into proverbs. The popular consciousness absorbs each\r\nword of negation, condemnation or curse addressed towards absolutism, as\r\na sponge absorbs fluid substance. No step of the administration remains\r\nunpunished. Each of its blunders is carefully taken account of. Its\r\nadvances are met with ridicule, its threats breed hatred. The vast\r\napparatus of the liberal press circulates daily thousands of facts,\r\nstirring, exciting, inflaming popular emotion.\r\n\r\nThe pent up feelings are seeking an outlet. Thought strives to turn into\r\naction. The vociferous liberal press, however, while feeding popular\r\nunrest, tends to divert its current into a small channel; it spreads\r\nsuperstitious reverence for \"public opinion,\" helpless, unorganized\r\n\"public opinion,\" which does not discharge itself into action; it brands\r\nthe revolutionary method of national emancipation; it upholds the\r\nillusion of legality; it centers all the attention and all the hopes of\r\nthe embittered groups around the Zemstvo campaign, thus systematically\r\npreparing a great debacle for the popular movement. Acute\r\ndissatisfaction, finding no outlet, discouraged by the inevitable\r\nfailure of the legal Zemstvo campaign which has no traditions of\r\nrevolutionary struggle in the past and no clear prospects in the future,\r\nmust necessarily manifest itself in an outbreak of desperate terrorism,\r\nleaving radical intellectuals in the role of helpless, passive, though\r\nsympathetic onlookers, leaving liberals to choke in a fit of platonic\r\nenthusiasm while lending doubtful assistance.\r\n\r\nThis ought not to take place. We ought to take hold of the current of\r\npopular excitement; we ought to turn the attention of numerous\r\ndissatisfied social groups to one colossal undertaking headed by the\r\nproletariat,--to the _National Revolution_.\r\n\r\nThe vanguard of the Revolution ought to wake from indolence all other\r\nelements of the people; to appear here and there and everywhere; to put\r\nthe questions of political struggle in the boldest possible fashion; to\r\ncall, to castigate, to unmask hypocritical democracy; to make democrats\r\nand Zemstvo liberals clash against each other; to wake again and again,\r\nto call, to castigate, to demand a clear answer to the question, _What\r\nare you going to do?_ to allow no retreat; to compel the legal liberals\r\nto admit their own weakness; to alienate from them the democratic\r\nelements and help the latter along the way of the revolution. To do this\r\nwork means to draw the threads of sympathy of all the democratic\r\nopposition towards the revolutionary campaign of the proletariat.\r\n\r\nWe ought to do all in our power to draw the attention and gain the\r\nsympathy of the poor non-proletarian city population. During the last\r\nmass actions of the proletariat, as in the general strikes of 1903 in\r\nthe South, nothing was done in this respect, and this was the weakest\r\npoint of the preparatory work. According to press correspondents, the\r\nqueerest rumors often circulated among the population as to the\r\nintentions of the strikers. The city inhabitants expected attacks on\r\ntheir houses, the store keepers were afraid of being looted, the Jews\r\nwere in a dread of pogroms. This ought to be avoided. _A political\r\nstrike, as a single combat of the city proletariat with the police and\r\nthe army, the remaining population being hostile or even indifferent, is\r\ndoomed to failure._\r\n\r\nThe indifference of the population would tell primarily on the morale of\r\nthe proletariat itself, and then on the attitude of the soldiers. Under\r\nsuch conditions, the stand of the administration must necessarily be\r\nmore determined. The generals would remind the officers, and the\r\nofficers would pass to the soldiers the words of Dragomirov: \"Rifles are\r\ngiven for sharp shooting, and nobody is permitted to squander cartridges\r\nfor nothing.\"\r\n\r\n_A political strike of the proletariat ought to turn into a political\r\ndemonstration of the population_, this is the first prerequisite of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe second important prerequisite is the mood of the army. A\r\ndissatisfaction among the soldiers, a vague sympathy for the\r\n\"revoluters,\" is an established fact. Only part of this sympathy may\r\nrightly be attributed to our direct propaganda among the soldiers. The\r\nmajor part is done by the practical clashes between army units and\r\nprotesting masses. Only hopeless idiots or avowed scoundrels dare to\r\nshoot at a living target. An overwhelming majority of the soldiers are\r\nloathe to serve as executioners; this is unanimously admitted by all\r\ncorrespondents describing the battles of the army with unarmed people.\r\nThe average soldier aims above the heads of the crowd. It would be\r\nunnatural if the reverse were the case. When the Bessarabian regiment\r\nreceived orders to quell the Kiev general strike, the commander declared\r\nhe could not vouch for the attitude of his soldiers. The order, then,\r\nwas sent to the Cherson regiment, but there was not one half-company in\r\nthe entire regiment which would live up to the expectations of their\r\nsuperiors.\r\n\r\nKiev was no exception. The conditions of the army must now be more\r\nfavorable for the revolution than they were in 1903. We have gone\r\nthrough a year of war. It is hardly possible to measure the influence of\r\nthe past year on the minds of the army. The influence, however, must be\r\nenormous. War draws not only the attention of the people, it arouses\r\nalso the professional interest of the army. Our ships are slow, our guns\r\nhave a short range, our soldiers are uneducated, our sergeants have\r\nneither compass nor map, our soldiers are bare-footed, hungry, and\r\nfreezing, our Red Cross is stealing, our commissariat is\r\nstealing,--rumors and facts of this kind leak down to the army and are\r\nbeing eagerly absorbed. Each rumor, as strong acid, dissolves the rust\r\nof mental drill. Years of peaceful propaganda could hardly equal in\r\ntheir results one day of warfare. The mere mechanism of discipline\r\nremains, the faith, however, the conviction that it is right to carry\r\nout orders, the belief that the present conditions can be continued,\r\nare rapidly dwindling. The less faith the army has in absolutism, the\r\nmore faith it has in its foes.\r\n\r\nWe ought to make use of this situation. We ought to explain to the\r\nsoldiers the meaning of the workingmen's action which is being prepared\r\nby the Party. We ought to make profuse use of the slogan which is bound\r\nto unite the army with the revolutionary people, _Away with the War!_ We\r\nought to create a situation where the officers would not be able to\r\ntrust their soldiers at the crucial moment. This would reflect on the\r\nattitude of the officers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe rest will be done by the street. It will dissolve the remnants of\r\nthe barrack-hypnosis in the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people.\r\n\r\nThe main factor, however, remain the revolutionary masses. True it is\r\nthat during the war the most advanced elements of the masses, the\r\nthinking proletariat, have not stepped openly to the front with that\r\ndegree of determination which was required by the critical historic\r\nmoment. Yet it would manifest a lack of political backbone and a\r\ndeplorable superficiality, should one draw from this fact any kind of\r\npessimistic conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe war has fallen upon our public life with all its colossal weight.\r\nThe dreadful monster, breathing blood and fire, loomed up on the\r\npolitical horizon, shutting out everything, sinking its steel clutches\r\ninto the body of the people, inflicting wound upon wound, causing mortal\r\npain, which for a moment makes it even impossible to ask for the causes\r\nof the pain. The war, as every great disaster, accompanied by crisis,\r\nunemployment, mobilization, hunger and death, stunned the people, caused\r\ndespair, but not protest. This is, however, only a beginning. Raw masses\r\nof the people, silent social strata, which yesterday had no connection\r\nwith the revolutionary elements, were knocked by sheer mechanical power\r\nof facts to face the central event of present-day Russia, the war. They\r\nwere horrified, they could not catch their breaths. The revolutionary\r\nelements, who prior to the war had ignored the passive masses, were\r\naffected by the atmosphere of despair and concentrated horror. This\r\natmosphere enveloped them, it pressed with a leaden weight on their\r\nminds. The voice of determined protest could hardly be raised in the\r\nmidst of elemental suffering. The revolutionary proletariat which had\r\nnot yet recovered from the wounds received in July, 1903, was powerless\r\nto oppose the \"call of the primitive.\"\r\n\r\nThe year of war, however, passed not without results. Masses, yesterday\r\nprimitive, to-day are confronted with the most tremendous events. They\r\nmust seek to understand them. The very duration of the war has produced\r\na desire for reasoning, for questioning as to the meaning of it all.\r\nThus the war, while hampering for a period of time the revolutionary\r\ninitiative of thousands, has awakened to life the political thought of\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThe year of war passed not without results, not a single day passed\r\nwithout results. In the lower strata of the people, in the very depths\r\nof the masses, a work was going on, a movement of molecules,\r\nimperceptible, yet irresistible, incessant, a work of accumulating\r\nindignation, bitterness, revolutionary energy. The atmosphere our\r\nstreets are breathing now is no longer an atmosphere of blank despair,\r\nit is an atmosphere of concentrated indignation which seeks for means\r\nand ways for revolutionary action. Each expedient action of the vanguard\r\nof our working masses would now carry away with it not only all our\r\nrevolutionary reserves, but also thousands and hundreds of thousands of\r\nrevolutionary recruits. This mobilization, unlike the mobilization of\r\nthe government, would be carried out in the presence of general\r\nsympathy and active assistance of an overwhelming majority of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of strong sympathies of the masses, in the presence of\r\nactive assistance on the part of the democratic elements of the people;\r\nfacing a government commonly hated, unsuccessful both in big and in\r\nsmall undertakings, a government defeated on the seas, defeated in the\r\nfields of battle, despised, discouraged, with no faith in the coming\r\nday, a government vainly struggling, currying favor, provoking and\r\nretreating, lying and suffering exposure, insolent and frightened;\r\nfacing an army whose morale has been shattered by the entire course of\r\nthe war, whose valor, energy, enthusiasm and heroism have met an\r\ninsurmountable wall in the form of administrative anarchy, an army which\r\nhas lost faith in the unshakable security of a regime it is called to\r\nserve, a dissatisfied, grumbling army which more than once has torn\r\nitself free from the clutches of discipline during the last year and\r\nwhich is eagerly listening to the roar of revolutionary voices,--such\r\nwill be the conditions under which the revolutionary proletariat will\r\nwalk out into the streets. It seems to us that no better conditions\r\ncould have been created by history for a final attack. History has done\r\neverything it was allowed by elemental wisdom. The thinking\r\nrevolutionary forces of the country have to do the rest.\r\n\r\nA tremendous amount of revolutionary energy has been accumulated. It\r\nshould not vanish with no avail, it should not be dissipated in\r\nscattered engagements and clashes, with no coherence and no definite\r\nplan. All efforts ought to be made to concentrate the bitterness, the\r\nanger, the protest, the rage, the hatred of the masses, to give those\r\nemotions a common language, a common goal, to unite, to solidify all the\r\nparticles of the masses, to make them feel and understand that they are\r\nnot isolated, that simultaneously, with the same slogan on the banner,\r\nwith the same goal in mind, innumerable particles are rising everywhere.\r\nIf this understanding is achieved, half of the revolution is done.\r\n\r\nWe have got to summon all revolutionary forces to simultaneous action.\r\nHow can we do it?\r\n\r\nFirst of all we ought to remember that the main scene of revolutionary\r\nevents is bound to be the city. Nobody is likely to deny this. It is\r\nevident, further, that street demonstrations can turn into a popular\r\nrevolution only when they are a manifestation of _masses_, i.e., when\r\nthey embrace, in the first place, the workers of factories and plants.\r\nTo make the workers quit their machines and stands; to make them walk\r\nout of the factory premises into the street; to lead them to the\r\nneighboring plant; to proclaim there a cessation of work; to make new\r\nmasses walk out into the street; to go thus from factory to factory,\r\nfrom plant to plant, incessantly growing in numbers, sweeping police\r\nbarriers, absorbing new masses that happened to come across, crowding\r\nthe streets, taking possession of buildings suitable for popular\r\nmeetings, fortifying those buildings, holding continuous revolutionary\r\nmeetings with audiences coming and going, bringing order into the\r\nmovements of the masses, arousing their spirit, explaining to them the\r\naim and the meaning of what is going on; to turn, finally, the entire\r\ncity into one revolutionary camp, this is, broadly speaking, the plan of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe starting point ought to be the factories and plants. That means that\r\nstreet manifestations of a serious character, fraught with decisive\r\nevents, ought to begin with _political strikes of the masses_.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to fix a date for a strike, than for a demonstration of\r\nthe people, just as it is easier to move masses ready for action than to\r\norganize new masses.\r\n\r\nA political strike, however, not a _local, but a general political\r\nstrike all over Russia_,--ought to have a general political slogan. This\r\nslogan is: _to stop the war and to call a National Constituent\r\nAssembly_.\r\n\r\nThis demand ought to become nation-wide, and herein lies the task for\r\nour propaganda preceding the all-Russian general strike. We ought to use\r\nall possible occasions to make the idea of a National Constituent\r\nAssembly popular among the people. Without losing one moment, we ought\r\nto put into operation all the technical means and all the powers of\r\npropaganda at our disposal. Proclamations and speeches, educational\r\ncircles and mass-meetings ought to carry broadcast, to propound and to\r\nexplain the demand of a Constituent Assembly. There ought to be not one\r\nman in a city who should not know that his demand is: a National\r\nConstituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe peasants ought to be called to assemble on the day of the political\r\nstrike and to pass resolutions demanding the calling of a Constituent\r\nAssembly. The suburban peasants ought to be called into the cities to\r\nparticipate in the street movements of the masses gathered under the\r\nbanner of a Constituent Assembly. All societies and organizations,\r\nprofessional and learned bodies, organs of self-government and organs of\r\nthe opposition press ought to be notified in advance by the workingmen\r\nthat they are preparing for an all-Russian political strike, fixed for a\r\ncertain date, to bring about the calling of a Constituent Assembly. The\r\nworkingmen ought to demand from all societies and corporations that, on\r\nthe day appointed for the mass-manifestation, they should join in the\r\ndemand of a National Constituent Assembly. The workingmen ought to\r\ndemand from the opposition press that it should popularize their slogan\r\nand that on the eve of the demonstration it should print an appeal to\r\nthe population to join the proletarian manifestation under the banner of\r\na National Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nWe ought to carry on the most intensive propaganda in the army in order\r\nthat on the day of the strike each soldier, sent to curb the \"rebels,\"\r\nshould know that he is facing the people who are demanding a National\r\nConstituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATORY NOTES\r\n\r\n     \"_The hiss of the knout_\" which ended the era of \"cordial\r\n     relations\" was a statement issued by the government on December 12,\r\n     1904, declaring that \"all disturbances of peace and order and all\r\n     gatherings of an anti-governmental character must and will be\r\n     stopped by all legal means in command of the authorities.\" The\r\n     Zemstvo and municipal bodies were advised to keep from political\r\n     utterings. As to the Socialist parties, and to labor movement in\r\n     general, they were prosecuted under Svyatopolk-Mirski as severely\r\n     as under Von Plehve.\r\n\r\n     \"_The vast apparatus of the liberal press_\" was the only way to\r\n     reach millions. The revolutionary \"underground\" press, which\r\n     assumed towards 1905 unusual proportions, could, after all, reach\r\n     only a limited number of readers. In times of political unrest, the\r\n     public became used to read between the lines of the legal press all\r\n     it needed to feed its hatred of oppression.\r\n\r\n     By \"_legal_\" _press_, \"_legal_\" _liberals_ are meant the open\r\n     public press and those liberals who were trying to comply with the\r\n     legal requirements of absolutism even in their work of condemning\r\n     the absolutist order. The term \"legal\" is opposed by the term\r\n     \"revolutionary\" which is applied to political actions in defiance\r\n     of law.\r\n\r\n     _Dragomirov_ was for many years Commander of the Kiev Military\r\n     region and known by his epigrammatic style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVENTS IN PETERSBURG\r\n\r\n     This is an essay of triumph. Written on January 20, 1905, eleven\r\n     days after the \"bloody Sunday,\" it gave vent to the enthusiastic\r\n     feelings of every true revolutionist aroused by unmistakable signs\r\n     of an approaching storm. The march of tens of thousands of\r\n     workingmen to the Winter Palace to submit to the \"Little Father\" a\r\n     petition asking for \"bread and freedom,\" was on the surface a\r\n     peaceful and loyal undertaking. Yet it breathed indignation and\r\n     revolt. The slaughter of peaceful marchers (of whom over 5,000 were\r\n     killed or wounded) and the following wave of hatred and\r\n     revolutionary determination among the masses, marked the beginning\r\n     of broad revolutionary uprisings.\r\n\r\n     For Trotzky, the awakening of the masses to political activity was\r\n     not only a good revolutionary omen, but also a defeat of liberal\r\n     ideology and liberal tactics. Those tactics had been planned under\r\n     the assumption that the Russian people were not ripe for a\r\n     revolution. Trotzky, a thorough revolutionist, _saw_ in the liberal\r\n     movement a manifestation of political superstitions. To him, the\r\n     _only_ way to overthrow absolutism was the way of a violent\r\n     revolution. Yet, when the liberals proudly asserted that the\r\n     revolutionary masses of Russia were only a creation of the\r\n     overheated phantasy of the revolutionists, while the movement of\r\n     the well-to-do intelligent elements was a flagrant fact, the\r\n     Social-Democrats had no material proofs to the contrary, except\r\n     sporadic outbursts of unrest among the workingmen and, of course,\r\n     the conviction of those revolutionists who were in touch with the\r\n     masses. It is, therefore, easy to understand the triumph of a\r\n     Trotzky or any other Socialist after January 9th. In Trotzky's\r\n     opinion, the 9th of January had put liberalism into the archives.\r\n     \"We are done with it for the entire period of the revolution,\" he\r\n     exclaims. The most remarkable part of this essay, as far as\r\n     political vision is concerned, is Trotzky's prediction that the\r\n     left wing of the \"Osvoboshdenie\" liberals (later organized as the\r\n     Constitutional Democratic Party) would attempt to become leaders of\r\n     the revolutionary masses and to \"tame\" them. The Liberals did not\r\n     fail to make the attempt in 1905 and 1906, but with no success\r\n     whatever. Neither did Social-Democracy, however, completely succeed\r\n     in leading the masses all through the revolution, in the manner\r\n     outlined by Trotzky in this essay. True, the Social-Democrats were\r\n     the party that gained the greatest influence over the workingmen in\r\n     the stormy year of 1905; their slogans were universally accepted by\r\n     the masses; their members were everywhere among the first ranks of\r\n     revolutionary forces; yet events developed too rapidly and\r\n     spontaneously to make the leadership of a political organization\r\n     possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow invincibly eloquent are facts! How utterly powerless are words!\r\n\r\nThe masses have made themselves heard! They have kindled revolutionary\r\nflames on Caucasian hill-tops; they have clashed, breast against breast,\r\nwith the guards' regiments and the cossacks on that unforgettable day of\r\nJanuary Ninth; they have filled the streets and squares of industrial\r\ncities with the noise and clatter of their fights....\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary masses are no more a theory, they are a fact. For the\r\nSocial-Democratic Party there is nothing new in this fact. We had\r\npredicted it long ago. We had seen its coming at a time when the noisy\r\nliberal banquets seemed to form a striking contrast with the political\r\nsilence of the people. _The revolutionary masses are a fact_, was our\r\nassertion. The clever liberals shrugged their shoulders in contempt.\r\nThose gentlemen think themselves sober realists solely because they are\r\nunable to grasp the consequences of great causes, because they make it\r\ntheir business to be humble servants of each ephemeral political fact.\r\nThey think themselves sober statesmen in spite of the fact that history\r\nmocks at their wisdom, tearing to pieces their school books, making to\r\nnaught their designs, and magnificently laughing at their pompous\r\npredictions.\r\n\r\n\"_There are no revolutionary people in Russia as yet._\" \"_The Russian\r\nworkingman is backward in culture, in self-respect, and (we refer\r\nprimarily to the workingmen of Petersburg and Moscow) he is not yet\r\nprepared for organized social and political struggle._\"\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Struve wrote in his _Osvoboshdenie_. He wrote it on January\r\n7th, 1905. Two days later the proletariat of Petersburg arose.\r\n\r\n\"_There are no revolutionary people in Russia as yet._\" These words\r\nought to have been engraved on the forehead of Mr. Struve were it not\r\nthat Mr. Struve's forehead already resembles a tombstone under which so\r\nmany plans, slogans, and ideas have been buried,--Socialist, liberal,\r\n\"patriotic,\" revolutionary, monarchic, democratic and other ideas, all\r\nof them calculated not to run too far ahead and all of them hopelessly\r\ndragging behind.\r\n\r\n\"_There are no revolutionary people in Russia as yet_,\" so it was\r\ndeclared through the mouth of _Osvoboshdenie_ by Russian liberalism\r\nwhich in the course of three months had succeeded in convincing itself\r\nthat liberalism was the main figure on the political stage and that its\r\nprogram and tactics would determine the future of Russia. Before this\r\ndeclaration had reached its readers, the wires carried into the remotest\r\ncorners of the world the great message of the beginning of a National\r\nRevolution in Russia.\r\n\r\nYes, the Revolution has begun. We had hoped for it, we had had no doubt\r\nabout it. For long years, however, it had been to us a mere deduction\r\nfrom our \"doctrine,\" which all nonentities of all political\r\ndenominations had mocked at. They never believed in the revolutionary\r\nrole of the proletariat, yet they believed in the power of Zemstvo\r\npetitions, in Witte, in \"blocs\" combining naughts with naughts, in\r\nSvyatopolk-Mirski, in a stick of dynamite.... There was no political\r\nsuperstition they did not believe in. Only the belief in the proletariat\r\nto them was a superstition.\r\n\r\nHistory, however, does not question political oracles, and the\r\nrevolutionary people do not need a passport from political eunuchs.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution has come. One move of hers has lifted the people over\r\nscores of steps, up which in times of peace we would have had to drag\r\nourselves with hardships and fatigue. The Revolution has come and\r\ndestroyed the plans of so many politicians who had dared to make their\r\nlittle political calculations with no regard for the master, the\r\nrevolutionary people. The Revolution has come and destroyed scores of\r\nsuperstitions, and has manifested the power of the program which is\r\nfounded on the revolutionary logic of the development of the masses.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution has come, and the period of our political infancy has\r\npassed. Down to the archives went our traditional liberalism whose only\r\nresource was the belief in a lucky change of administrative figures. Its\r\nperiod of bloom was the stupid reign of Svyatopolk-Mirski. Its ripest\r\nfruit was the Ukase of December 12th. But now, January Ninth has come\r\nand effaced the \"Spring,\" and has put military dictatorship in its\r\nplace, and has promoted to the rank of Governor-General of Petersburg\r\nthe same Trepov, who just before had been pulled down from the post of\r\nMoscow Chief of Police by the same liberal opposition.\r\n\r\nThat liberalism which did not care to know about the revolution, which\r\nhatched plots behind the scenes, which ignored the masses, which\r\ncounted only on its diplomatic genius, has been swept away. _We are done\r\nwith it for the entire period of the revolution._\r\n\r\nThe liberals of the left wing will now follow the people. They will soon\r\nattempt to take the people into their own hands. The people are a power.\r\nOne must _master_ them. But they are, too, a _revolutionary_ power. One,\r\ntherefore, must _tame_ them. This is, evidently, the future tactics of\r\nthe _Osvoboshdenie_ group. Our fight for a revolution, our preparatory\r\nwork for the revolution must also be our merciless fight against\r\nliberalism for influence over the masses, for a leading role in the\r\nrevolution. In this fight we shall be supported by a great power, the\r\nvery logic of the revolution!\r\n\r\nThe Revolution has come.\r\n\r\nThe _forms_ taken by the uprising of January 9th could not have been\r\nforeseen. A revolutionary priest, in perplexing manner placed by history\r\nat the head of the working masses for several days, lent the events the\r\nstamp of his personality, his conceptions, his rank. This form may\r\nmislead many an observer as to the real substance of the events. The\r\nactual meaning of the events, however, is just that which\r\nSocial-Democracy foresaw. The central figure is the Proletariat. The\r\nworkingmen start a strike, they unite, they formulate political demands,\r\nthey walk out into the streets, they win the enthusiastic sympathy of\r\nthe entire population, they engage in battles with the army.... The\r\nhero, Gapon, has not created the revolutionary energy of the Petersburg\r\nworkingmen, he only unloosed it. He found thousands of thinking\r\nworkingmen and tens of thousands of others in a state of political\r\nagitation. He formed a plan which united all those masses--for the\r\nperiod of one day. The masses went to speak to the Tzar. They were faced\r\nby Ulans, cossacks, guards. Gapon's plan had not prepared the workingmen\r\nfor that. What was the result? They seized arms wherever they could,\r\nthey built barricades.... They fought, though, apparently, they went to\r\nbeg for mercy. This shows that they went _not to beg, but to demand_.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat of Petersburg manifested a degree of political alertness\r\nand revolutionary energy far exceeding the limits of the plan laid out\r\nby a casual leader. Gapon's plan contained many elements of\r\nrevolutionary romanticism. On January 9th, the plan collapsed. Yet the\r\nrevolutionary proletariat of Petersburg is no romanticism, it is a\r\nliving reality. So is the proletariat of other cities. An enormous wave\r\nis rolling over Russia. It has not yet quieted down. One shock, and the\r\nproletarian crater will begin to erupt torrents of revolutionary lava.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat has arisen. It has chosen an incidental pretext and a\r\ncasual leader--a self-sacrificing priest. That seemed enough to start\r\nwith. It was not enough to _win_.\r\n\r\n_Victory_ demands not a romantic method based on an illusory plan, but\r\nrevolutionary tactics. _A simultaneous action of the proletariat of all\r\nRussia must be prepared._ This is the first condition. No local\r\ndemonstration has a serious political significance any longer. After the\r\nPetersburg uprising, only an all-Russian uprising should take place.\r\nScattered outbursts would only consume the precious revolutionary energy\r\nwith no results. Wherever spontaneous outbursts occur, as a late echo of\r\nthe Petersburg uprising, _they must be made use of to revolutionize and\r\nto solidify the masses, to popularize among them the idea of an\r\nall-Russian uprising_ as a task of the approaching months, perhaps only\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to discuss the technique of a popular uprising.\r\nThe questions of revolutionary technique can be solved only in a\r\npractical way, under the live pressure of struggle and under constant\r\ncommunication with the active members of the Party. There is no doubt,\r\nhowever, that the technical problems of organizing a popular uprising\r\nassume at present tremendous importance. Those problems demand the\r\ncollective attention of the Party.\r\n\r\n    [Trotzky then proceeds to discuss the question of armament,\r\n    arsenals, clashes with army units, barricades, etc. Then he\r\n    continues:]\r\n\r\nAs stated before, these questions ought to be solved by local\r\norganizations. Of course, this is only a minor task as compared with the\r\npolitical leadership of the masses. Yet, this task is most essential for\r\nthe political leadership itself. The organization of the revolution\r\nbecomes at present the axis of the political leadership of revolting\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nWhat are the requirements for this leadership? A few very simple things:\r\nfreedom from routine in matters of organization; freedom from miserable\r\ntraditions of underground conspiracy; a broad view; courageous\r\ninitiative; ability to gauge situations; courageous initiative once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe events of January 9th have given us a revolutionary beginning. We\r\nmust never fall below this. We must make this our starting point in\r\nmoving the revolution forward. We must imbue our work of propaganda and\r\norganization with the political ideas and revolutionary aspirations of\r\nthe uprising of the Petersburg workers.\r\n\r\nThe Russian revolution has approached its climax--a national uprising.\r\nThe organization of this uprising, which would determine the fate of the\r\nentire revolution, becomes the day's task for our Party.\r\n\r\nNo one can accomplish it, but we. Priest Gapon could appear only once.\r\nHe cherished extraordinary illusions, that is why he could do what he\r\nhas done. Yet he could remain at the head of the masses for a brief\r\nperiod only. The memory of George Gapon will always be dear to the\r\nrevolutionary proletariat. Yet his memory will be that of a hero who\r\nopened the sluices of the revolutionary torrent. Should a new figure\r\nstep to the front now, equal to Gapon in energy, revolutionary\r\nenthusiasm and power of political illusions, his arrival would be too\r\nlate. What was great in George Gapon may now look ridiculous. There is\r\nno room for a second George Gapon, as the thing now needed is not an\r\nillusion, but clear revolutionary thinking, a decisive plan of action, a\r\nflexible revolutionary organization which would be able to give the\r\nmasses a slogan, to lead them into the field of battle, to launch an\r\nattack all along the line and bring the revolution to a victorious\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nSuch an organization can be the work of Social-Democracy only. No other\r\nparty is able to create it. No other party can give the masses a\r\nrevolutionary slogan, as no one outside our Party has freed himself from\r\nall considerations not pertaining to the interests of the revolution. No\r\nother party, but Social-Democracy, is able to organize the action of the\r\nmasses, as no one but our Party is closely connected with the masses.\r\n\r\nOur Party has committed many errors, blunders, almost crimes. It\r\nwavered, evaded, hesitated, it showed inertia and lack of pluck. At\r\ntimes it hampered the revolutionary movement.\r\n\r\n_However, there is no revolutionary party but the Social-Democratic\r\nParty!_\r\n\r\nOur organizations are imperfect. Our connections with the masses are\r\ninsufficient. Our technique is primitive.\r\n\r\n_Yet, there is no party connected with the masses but the\r\nSocial-Democratic Party!_\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Revolution is the Proletariat. At the head of the\r\nProletariat is Social-Democracy!\r\n\r\nLet us exert all our power, comrades! Let us put all our energy and all\r\nour passion into this. Let us not forget for a moment the great\r\nresponsibility vested in our Party: a responsibility before the Russian\r\nRevolution and in the sight of International Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat of the entire world looks to us with expectation. Broad\r\nvistas are being opened for humanity by a victorious Russian revolution.\r\nComrades, let us do our duty!\r\n\r\nLet us close our ranks, comrades! Let us unite, and unite the masses!\r\nLet us prepare, and prepare the masses for the day of decisive actions!\r\nLet us overlook nothing. Let us leave no power unused for the Cause.\r\n\r\nBrave, honest, harmoniously united, we shall march forward, linked by\r\nunbreakable bonds, brothers in the Revolution!\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATORY NOTES\r\n\r\n     _Osvoboshdenie_ (_Emancipation_) was the name of a liberal magazine\r\n     published in Stuttgart, Germany, and smuggled into Russia to be\r\n     distributed among the Zemstvo-liberals and other progressive\r\n     elements grouped about the Zemstvo-organization. The\r\n     _Osvoboshdenie_ advocated a constitutional monarchy; it was,\r\n     however, opposed to revolutionary methods.\r\n\r\n     _Peter Struve_, first a Socialist, then a Liberal, was the editor\r\n     of the _Osvoboshdenie_. Struve is an economist and one of the\r\n     leading liberal journalists in Russia.\r\n\r\n     _Zemstvo-petitions_, accepted in form of resolutions at the\r\n     meetings of the liberal Zemstvo bodies and forwarded to the central\r\n     government, were one of the means the liberals used in their\r\n     struggle for a Constitution. The petitions, worded in a very\r\n     moderate language, demanded the abolition of \"lawlessness\" on the\r\n     part of the administration and the introduction of a \"legal order,\"\r\n     i.e., a Constitution.\r\n\r\n     _Sergius Witte_, Minister of Finance in the closing years of the\r\n     19th Century and up to the revolution of 1905, was known as a\r\n     bureaucrat of a liberal brand.\r\n\r\n     _The Ukase of December 12th, 1905_, was an answer of the government\r\n     to the persistent political demands of the \"Spring\" time. The Ukase\r\n     promised a number of insignificant bureaucratic reforms, not even\r\n     mentioning a popular representation and threatening increased\r\n     punishments for \"disturbances of peace and order.\"\r\n\r\n     _Trepov_ was one of the most hated bureaucrats, a devoted pupil of\r\n     Von Plehve's in the work of drowning revolutionary movements in\r\n     blood.\r\n\r\n     _George Gapon_ was the priest who organized the march of January\r\n     9th. Trotzky's admiration for the heroism of Gapon was originally\r\n     shared by many revolutionists. Later it became known that Gapon\r\n     played a dubious role as a friend of labor, and an agent of the\r\n     government.\r\n\r\n     _The_ \"_Political illusions_\" of George Gapon, referred to in this\r\n     essay, was his assumption that the Tzar was a loving father to his\r\n     people. Gapon hoped to reach the Emperor of all the Russias and to\r\n     make him \"receive the workingmen's petition from hand to hand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPECTS OF A LABOR DICTATORSHIP\r\n\r\n     This is, perhaps, the most remarkable piece of political writing\r\n     the Revolution has produced. Written early in 1906, after the great\r\n     upheavals of the fall of 1905, at a time when the Russian\r\n     revolution was obviously going down hill, and autocracy, after a\r\n     moment of relaxation, was increasing its deadly grip over the\r\n     country, the essays under the name _Sum Total and Prospectives_\r\n     (which we have here changed into a more comprehensible name,\r\n     _Prospects of Labor Dictatorship_) aroused more amazement than\r\n     admiration. They seemed so entirely out of place. They ignored the\r\n     liberal parties as quite negligible quantities. They ignored the\r\n     creation of the Duma to which the Constitutional Democrats attached\r\n     so much importance as a place where democracy would fight the\r\n     battles of the people and win. They ignored the very fact that the\r\n     vanguard of the revolution, the industrial proletariat, was beaten,\r\n     disorganized, downhearted, tired out.\r\n\r\n     The essays met with opposition on the part of leading\r\n     Social-Democratic thinkers of both the Bolsheviki and Mensheviki\r\n     factions. The essays seemed to be more an expression of Trotzky's\r\n     revolutionary ardor, of his unshakable faith in the future of the\r\n     Russian revolution, than a reflection of political realities. It\r\n     was known that he wrote them within prison walls. Should not the\r\n     very fact of his imprisonment have convinced him that in drawing a\r\n     picture of labor dictatorship he was only dreaming?\r\n\r\n     History has shown that it was not a dream. Whatever our attitude\r\n     towards the course of events in the 1917 revolution may be, we must\r\n     admit that, in the main, this course has taken the direction\r\n     predicted in Trotzky's essays. There is a labor dictatorship now in\r\n     Russia. It is a _labor_ dictatorship, not a \"dictatorship of the\r\n     proletariat and the peasants.\" The liberal and radical parties have\r\n     lost influence. The labor government has put collective ownership\r\n     and collective management of industries on the order of the day.\r\n     The labor government has not hesitated in declaring Russia to be\r\n     ready for a Socialist revolution. It was compelled to do so under\r\n     the pressure of revolutionary proletarian masses. The Russian army\r\n     has been dissolved in the armed people. The Russian revolution has\r\n     called the workingmen of the world to make a social revolution.\r\n\r\n     All this had been outlined by Trotzky twelve years ago. When one\r\n     reads this series of essays, one has the feeling that they were\r\n     written not in the course of the first Russian upheaval (the essays\r\n     appeared in 1906 as part of a book by Trotzky, entitled _Our\r\n     Revolution_, Petersburg, N. Glagoleff, publisher) but as if they\r\n     were discussing problems of the present situation. This, more than\r\n     anything else, shows the _continuity_ of the revolution. The great\r\n     overthrow of 1917 was completed by the same political and social\r\n     forces that had met and learned to know each other in the storms of\r\n     1905 and 1906. The ideology of the various groups and parties had\r\n     hardly changed. Even the leaders of the major parties were, in the\r\n     main, the same persons. Of course, the international situation was\r\n     different. But even the possibility of a European war and its\r\n     consequences had been foreseen by Trotzky in his essays.\r\n\r\n     Twelve years ago those essays seemed to picture an imaginary world.\r\n     To-day they seem to tell the history of the Russian revolution. We\r\n     may agree or disagree with Trotzky, the leader, nobody can deny the\r\n     power and clarity of his political vision.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In the _first_ chapter, entitled \"Peculiarities of Our Historic\r\n     Development,\" the author gives a broad outline of the growth of\r\n     absolutism in Russia. Development of social forms in Russia, he\r\n     says, was slow and primitive. Our social life was constructed on an\r\n     archaic and meager economic foundation. Yet, Russia did not lead an\r\n     isolated life. Russia was under constant pressure of higher\r\n     politico-economical organisms,--the neighboring Western states. The\r\n     Russian state, in its struggle for existence, outgrew its economic\r\n     basis. Historic development in Russia, therefore, was taking place\r\n     under a terrific straining of national economic forces. The state\r\n     absorbed the major part of the national economic surplus and also\r\n     part of the product necessary for the maintenance of the people.\r\n     The state thus undermined its own foundation. On the other hand, to\r\n     secure the means indispensable for its growth, the state forced\r\n     economic development by bureaucratic measures. Ever since the end\r\n     of the seventeenth century, the state was most anxious to develop\r\n     industries in Russia. \"New trades, machines, factories, production\r\n     on a large scale, capital, appear from a certain angle to be an\r\n     artificial graft on the original economic trunk of the people.\r\n     Similarly, Russian science may appear from the same angle to be an\r\n     artificial graft on the natural trunk of national ignorance.\" This,\r\n     however, is a wrong conception. The Russian state could not have\r\n     created something out of nothing. State action only accelerated the\r\n     processes of natural evolution of economic life. State measures\r\n     that were in contradiction to those processes were doomed to\r\n     failure. Still, the role of the state in economic life was\r\n     enormous. When social development reached the stage where the\r\n     bourgeoisie classes began to experience a desire for political\r\n     institutions of a Western type, Russian autocracy was fully\r\n     equipped with all the material power of a modern European state. It\r\n     had at its command a centralized bureaucratic machinery, incapable\r\n     of regulating modern relations, yet strong enough to do the work of\r\n     oppression. It was in a position to overcome distance by means of\r\n     the telegraph and railroads,--a thing unknown to the\r\n     pre-revolutionary autocracies in Europe. It had a colossal army,\r\n     incompetent in wars with foreign enemies, yet strong enough to\r\n     maintain the authority of the state in internal affairs.\r\n\r\n     Based on its military and fiscal apparatus, absorbing the major\r\n     part of the country's resources, the government increased its\r\n     annual budget to an enormous amount of two billions of rubles, it\r\n     made the stock-exchange of Europe its treasury and the Russian\r\n     tax-payer a slave to European high finance. Gradually, the Russian\r\n     state became an end in itself. It evolved into a power independent\r\n     of society. It left unsatisfied the most elementary wants of the\r\n     people. It was unable even to defend the safety of the country\r\n     against foreign foes. Yet, it seemed strong, powerful, invincible.\r\n     It inspired awe.\r\n\r\n     It became evident that the Russian state would never grant reforms\r\n     of its own free will. As years passed, the conflict between\r\n     absolutism and the requirements of economic and cultural progress\r\n     became ever more acute. There was only one way to solve the\r\n     problem: \"to accumulate enough steam inside the iron kettle of\r\n     absolutism to burst the kettle.\" This was the way outlined by the\r\n     Marxists long ago. Marxism was the only doctrine that had correctly\r\n     predicted the course of development in Russia.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In the _second_ chapter, \"City and Capital,\" Trotzky attempts a\r\n     theoretical explanation to the weakness of the middle-class in\r\n     Russia. Russia of the eighteenth, and even of the major part of the\r\n     nineteenth, century, he writes, was marked by an absence of cities\r\n     as industrial centers. Our big cities were administrative rather\r\n     than industrial centers. Our primitive industries were scattered in\r\n     the villages, auxiliary occupations of the peasant farmers. Even\r\n     the population of our so called \"cities,\" in former generations\r\n     maintained itself largely by agriculture. Russian cities never\r\n     contained a prosperous, efficient and self-assured class of\r\n     artisans--that real foundation of the European middle class which\r\n     in the course of revolutions against absolutism identified itself\r\n     with the \"people.\" When modern capitalism, aided by absolutism,\r\n     appeared on the scene of Russia and turned large villages into\r\n     modern industrial centers almost over night, it had no middle-class\r\n     to build on. In Russian cities, therefore, the influence of the\r\n     bourgeoisie is far less than in western Europe. Russian cities\r\n     practically contain great numbers of workingmen and small groups of\r\n     capitalists. Moreover, the specific political weight of the Russian\r\n     proletariat is larger than that of the capital employed in Russia,\r\n     because the latter is to a great extent _imported_ capital. Thus,\r\n     while a large proportion of the capital operating in Russia exerts\r\n     its political influence in the parliaments of Belgium or France,\r\n     the working class employed by the same capital exert their entire\r\n     influence in the political life of Russia. As a result of these\r\n     peculiar historic developments, the Russian proletariat, recruited\r\n     from the pauperized peasant and ruined rural artisans, has\r\n     accumulated in the new cities in very great numbers, \"and nothing\r\n     stood between the workingmen and absolutism but a small class of\r\n     capitalists, separated from the 'people' (i.e., the middle-class in\r\n     the European sense of the word), half foreign in its derivation,\r\n     devoid of historic traditions, animated solely by a hunger for\r\n     profits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n1789-1848-1905\r\n\r\nHistory does not repeat itself. You are free to compare the Russian\r\nrevolution with the Great French Revolution, yet this would not make the\r\nformer resemble the latter. The nineteenth century passed not in vain.\r\n\r\nAlready the year of 1848 is widely different from 1789. As compared with\r\nthe Great Revolution, the revolutions in Prussia or Austria appear\r\namazingly small. From one viewpoint, the revolutions of 1848 came too\r\nearly; from another, too late. That gigantic exertion of power which is\r\nnecessary for the bourgeois society to get completely square with the\r\nmasters of the past, can be achieved either through powerful _unity_ of\r\nan entire nation arousing against feudal despotism, or through a\r\npowerful development of _class struggle_ within a nation striving for\r\nfreedom. In the first case--of which a classic example are the years\r\n1789-1793,--the national energy, compressed by the terrific resistance\r\nof the old regime, was spent entirely in the struggle against reaction.\r\nIn the second case--which has never appeared in history as yet, and\r\nwhich is treated here as hypothetical--the actual energy necessary for a\r\nvictory over the black forces of history is being developed within the\r\nbourgeois nation through \"civil war\" between classes. Fierce internal\r\nfriction characterizes the latter case. It absorbs enormous quantities\r\nof energy, prevents the bourgeoisie from playing a leading role, pushes\r\nits antagonist, the proletariat, to the front, gives the workingman\r\ndecades' experience in a month, makes them the central figures in\r\npolitical struggles, and puts very tight reins into their hands. Strong,\r\ndetermined, knowing no doubts, the proletariat gives events a powerful\r\ntwist.\r\n\r\nThus, it is either--or. Either a nation gathered into one compact whole,\r\nas a lion ready to leap; or a nation completely divided in the process\r\nof internal struggles, a nation that has released her best part for a\r\ntask which the whole was unable to complete. Such are the two polar\r\ntypes, whose purest forms, however, can be found only in logical\r\ncontraposition.\r\n\r\nHere, as in many other cases, the middle road is the worst. This was the\r\ncase in 1848.\r\n\r\nIn the French Revolution we see an active, enlightened bourgeoisie, not\r\nyet aware of the contradictions of its situation; entrusted by history\r\nwith the task of leadership in the struggle for a new order; fighting\r\nnot only against the archaic institutions of France, but also against\r\nthe forces of reaction throughout Europe. The bourgeoisie consciously,\r\nin the person of its various factions, assumes the leadership of the\r\nnation, it lures the masses into struggle, it coins slogans, it dictates\r\nrevolutionary tactics. Democracy unites the nation in one political\r\nideology. The people--small artisans, petty merchants, peasants, and\r\nworkingmen--elect bourgeois as their representatives; the mandates of\r\nthe communities are framed in the language of the bourgeoisie which\r\nbecomes aware of its Messianic role. Antagonisms do not fail to reveal\r\nthemselves in the course of the revolution, yet the powerful momentum of\r\nthe revolution removes one by one the most unresponsive elements of the\r\nbourgeoisie. Each stratum is torn off, but not before it has given over\r\nall its energy to the following one. The nation as a whole continues to\r\nfight with ever increasing persistence and determination. When the upper\r\nstratum of the bourgeoisie tears itself away from the main body of the\r\nnation to form an alliance with Louis XVI, the democratic demands of the\r\nnation turn _against_ this part of the bourgeoisie, leading to universal\r\nsuffrage and a republican government as logically consequent forms of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe Great French Revolution is a true national revolution. It is more\r\nthan that. It is a classic manifestation, on a national scale, of the\r\nworld-wide struggle of the bourgeois order for supremacy, for power, for\r\nunmitigated triumph. In 1848, the bourgeoisie was no more capable of a\r\nsimilar role. It did not want, it did not dare take the responsibility\r\nfor a revolutionary liquidation of a political order that stood in its\r\nway. The reason is clear. The task of the bourgeoisie--of which it was\r\nfully aware--was not to secure its _own_ political supremacy, but to\r\nsecure for itself _a share_ in the political power of the old regime.\r\nThe bourgeoisie of 1848, niggardly wise with the experience of the\r\nFrench bourgeoisie, was vitiated by its treachery, frightened by its\r\nfailures. It did not lead the masses to storm the citadels of the\r\nabsolutist order. On the contrary, with its back against the absolutist\r\norder, it resisted the onslaught of the masses that were pushing it\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe French bourgeoisie made its revolution great. Its consciousness was\r\nthe consciousness of the people, and no idea found its expression in\r\ninstitutions without having gone through its consciousness as an end, as\r\na task of political construction. It often resorted to theatrical poses\r\nto conceal from itself the limitations of its bourgeois world,--yet it\r\nmarched forward.\r\n\r\nThe German bourgeoisie, on the contrary, was not doing the revolutionary\r\nwork; it was \"doing away\" with the revolution from the very start. Its\r\nconsciousness revolted against the objective conditions of its\r\nsupremacy. The revolution could be completed not by the bourgeoisie, but\r\nagainst it. Democratic institutions seemed to the mind of the German\r\nbourgeois not an aim for his struggle, but a menace to his security.\r\n\r\nAnother class was required in 1848, a class capable of conducting the\r\nrevolution beside the bourgeoisie and in spite of it, a class not only\r\nready and able to push the bourgeoisie forward, but also to step over\r\nits political corpse, should events so demand. None of the other\r\nclasses, however, was ready for the job.\r\n\r\n_The petty middle class_ were hostile not only to the past, but also to\r\nthe future. They were still entangled in the meshes of medieval\r\nrelations, and they were unable to withstand the oncoming \"free\"\r\nindustry; they were still giving the cities their stamp, and they were\r\nalready giving way to the influences of big capital. Steeped in\r\nprejudices, stunned by the clatter of events, exploiting and being\r\nexploited, greedy and helpless in their greed, they could not become\r\nleaders in matters of world-wide importance. Still less were the\r\n_peasants_ capable of political initiative. Scattered over the country,\r\nfar from the nervous centers of politics and culture, limited in their\r\nviews, the peasants could have no great part in the struggles for a new\r\norder. The _democratic intellectuals_ possessed no social weight; they\r\neither dragged along behind their elder sister, the liberal bourgeoisie,\r\nas its political tail, or they separated themselves from the bourgeoisie\r\nin critical moments only to show their weakness.\r\n\r\n_The industrial workingmen_ were too weak, unorganized, devoid of\r\nexperience and knowledge. The capitalist development had gone far enough\r\nto make the abolition of old feudal relations imperative, yet it had not\r\ngone far enough to make the working class, the product of new economic\r\nrelations, a decisive political factor. Antagonism between bourgeoisie\r\nand proletariat, even within the national boundaries of Germany, was\r\nsharp enough to prevent the bourgeoisie from stepping to the front to\r\nassume national hegemony in the revolution, yet it was not sharp enough\r\nto allow the proletariat to become a national leader. True, the internal\r\nfrictions of the revolution had prepared the workingmen for political\r\nindependence, yet they weakened the energy and the unity of the\r\nrevolution and they caused a great waste of power. The result was that,\r\nafter the first successes, the revolution began to plod about in painful\r\nuncertainty, and under the first blows of the reaction it started\r\nbackwards. Austria gave the clearest and most tragic example of\r\nunfinished and unsettled relations in a revolutionary period. It was\r\nthis situation that gave Lassalle occasion to assert that henceforward\r\nrevolutions could find their support only in the class struggle of the\r\nproletariat. In a letter to Marx, dated October 24, 1849 he writes: \"The\r\nexperiences of Austria, Hungary and Germany in 1848 and 1849 have led me\r\nto the firm conclusion that no struggle in Europe can be successful\r\nunless it is proclaimed from the very beginning as purely Socialistic.\r\nNo struggle can succeed in which social problems appear as nebulous\r\nelements kept in the background, while on the surface the fight is\r\nbeing conducted under the slogan of national revival of bourgeois\r\nrepublicanism.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to criticize this bold conclusion. One thing is\r\nevident, namely that already at the middle of the nineteenth century the\r\nnational task of political emancipation could not be completed by a\r\nunanimous concerted onslaught of the entire nation. Only the independent\r\ntactics of the proletariat deriving its strength from no other source\r\nbut its class position, could have secured a victory of the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Russian working class of 1906 differs entirely from the Vienna\r\nworking class of 1848. The best proof of it is the all-Russian practice\r\nof the Councils of Workmen's Deputies (Soviets). Those are no\r\norganizations of conspirators prepared beforehand to step forward in\r\ntimes of unrest and to seize command over the working class. They are\r\norgans consciously created by the masses themselves to cooerdinate their\r\nrevolutionary struggle. The Soviets, elected by and responsible to the\r\nmasses, are thoroughly democratic institutions following the most\r\ndetermined class policy in the spirit of revolutionary Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the social composition of the Russian revolution are\r\nclearly shown in the question of arming the people.\r\n\r\n_Militia_ (national guard) was the first slogan and the first\r\nachievement of the revolutions of 1789 and 1848 in Paris, in all the\r\nItalian states and in Vienna and Berlin. In 1846, the demand for a\r\nnational guard (i.e., the armament of the propertied classes and the\r\n\"intellectuals\") was put forth by the entire bourgeois opposition,\r\nincluding the most moderate factions. In Russia, the demand for a\r\nnational guard finds no favor with the bourgeois parties. This is not\r\nbecause the liberals do not understand the importance of arming the\r\npeople: absolutism has given them in this respect more than one object\r\nlesson. The reason why liberals do not like the idea of a national guard\r\nis because they fully realize the impossibility of creating in Russia an\r\narmed revolutionary force outside of the proletariat and against the\r\nproletariat. They are ready to give up this demand, as they give up many\r\nothers, just as the French bourgeoisie headed by Thiers preferred to\r\ngive up Paris and France to Bismarck rather than to arm the working\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe problem of an armed revolution in Russia becomes essentially a\r\nproblem of the proletariat. National militia, this classic demand of\r\nthe bourgeoisie of 1848, appears in Russia from the very beginning as a\r\ndemand for arming the people, primarily the working class. Herein the\r\nfate of the Russian revolution manifests itself most clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION AND THE PROLETARIAT\r\n\r\nA revolution is an open contest of social forces in their struggle for\r\npolitical power.\r\n\r\nThe state is not an end in itself. It is only a working machine in the\r\nhands of the social force in power. As every machine, the state has its\r\nmotor, transmission, and its operator. Its motive power is the class\r\ninterest; its motor are propaganda, the press, influences of school and\r\nchurch, political parties, open air meetings, petitions, insurrections;\r\nits transmission is made up of legislative bodies actuated by the\r\ninterest of a caste, a dynasty, a guild or a class appearing under the\r\nguise of Divine or national will (absolutism or parliamentarism); its\r\noperator is the administration, with its police, judiciary, jails, and\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nThe state is not an end in itself. It is, however, the greatest means\r\nfor organizing, disorganizing and reorganizing social relations.\r\n\r\nAccording to who is directing the machinery of the State, it can be an\r\ninstrument of profoundest transformations, or a means of organized\r\nstagnation.\r\n\r\nEach political party worthy of its name strives to get hold of political\r\npower and thus to make the state serve the interests of the class\r\nrepresented by the party. Social-Democracy, as the party of the\r\nproletariat, naturally strives at political supremacy of the working\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat grows and gains strength with the growth of capitalism.\r\nFrom this viewpoint, the development of capitalism is the development of\r\nthe proletariat for dictatorship. The day and the hour, however, when\r\npolitical power should pass into the hands of the working class, is\r\ndetermined not directly by the degree of capitalistic development of\r\neconomic forces, but by the relations of class struggle, by the\r\ninternational situation, by a number of subjective elements, such as\r\ntradition, initiative, readiness to fight....\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not excluded that in a backward country with a lesser\r\ndegree of capitalistic development, the proletariat should sooner reach\r\npolitical supremacy than in a highly developed capitalist state. Thus,\r\nin middle-class Paris, the proletariat consciously took into its hands\r\nthe administration of public affairs in 1871. True it is, that the reign\r\nof the proletariat lasted only for two months, it is remarkable,\r\nhowever, that in far more advanced capitalist centers of England and the\r\nUnited States, the proletariat never was in power even for the duration\r\nof one day. To imagine that there is an automatic dependence between a\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat and the technical and productive\r\nresources of a country, is to understand economic determinism in a very\r\nprimitive way. Such a conception would have nothing to do with Marxism.\r\n\r\nIt is our opinion that the Russian revolution creates conditions whereby\r\npolitical power can (and, in case of a victorious revolution, _must_)\r\npass into the hands of the proletariat before the politicians of the\r\nliberal bourgeoisie would have occasion to give their political genius\r\nfull swing.\r\n\r\nSumming up the results of the revolution and counter-revolution in 1848\r\nand 1849, Marx wrote in his correspondences to the New York _Tribune_:\r\n\"The working class in Germany is, in its social and political\r\ndevelopment, as far behind that of England and France as the German\r\nbourgeoisie is behind the bourgeoisie of those countries. Like master,\r\nlike man. The evolution of the conditions of existence for a numerous,\r\nstrong, concentrated, and intelligent proletariat goes hand in hand\r\nwith the development of the conditions of existence for a numerous,\r\nwealthy, concentrated and powerful middle class. The working class\r\nmovement itself never is independent, never is of an exclusively\r\nproletarian character until all the different factions of the middle\r\nclass, and particularly its most progressive faction, the large\r\nmanufacturers, have conquered political power, and remodeled the State\r\naccording to their wants. It is then that the inevitable conflict\r\nbetween employer and the employed becomes imminent, and cannot be\r\nadjourned any longer.\"[1] This quotation must be familiar to the reader,\r\nas it has lately been very much abused by scholastic Marxists. It has\r\nbeen used as an iron-clad argument against the idea of a labor\r\ngovernment in Russia. If the Russian capitalistic bourgeoisie is not\r\nstrong enough to take governmental power into its hands, how is it\r\npossible to think of an industrial democracy, i.e., a political\r\nsupremacy of the proletariat, was the question.\r\n\r\n     [1] Karl Marx, _Germany in 1848_. (English edition, pp. 22-23.)\r\n\r\nLet us give this objection closer consideration.\r\n\r\nMarxism is primarily a method of analysis,--not the analysis of texts,\r\nbut the analysis of social relations. Applied to Russia, is it true\r\nthat the weakness of capitalistic liberalism means the weakness of the\r\nworking class? Is it true, not in the abstract, but in relation to\r\nRussia, that an independent proletarian movement is impossible before\r\nthe bourgeoisie assume political power? It is enough to formulate these\r\nquestions in order to understand what hopeless logical formalism there\r\nis hidden behind the attempt to turn Marx's historically relative remark\r\ninto a super-historic maxim.\r\n\r\nOur industrial development, though marked in times of prosperity by\r\nleaps and bounds of an \"American\" character, is in reality miserably\r\nsmall in comparison with the industry of the United States. Five million\r\npersons, forming 16.6 per cent. of the population engaged in economic\r\npursuits, are employed in the industries of Russia; six millions and\r\n22.2 per cent. are the corresponding figures for the United States. To\r\nhave a clear idea as to the real dimensions of industry in both\r\ncountries, we must remember that the population of Russia is twice as\r\nlarge as the population of the United States, and that the output of\r\nAmerican industries in 1900 amounted to 25 billions of rubles whereas\r\nthe output of Russian industries for the same year hardly reached 2.5\r\nbillions.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the number of the proletariat, the degree of its\r\nconcentration, its cultural level, and its political importance depend\r\nupon the degree of industrial development in each country.\r\n\r\nThis dependence, however, is not a direct one. Between the productive\r\nforces of a country on one side and the political strength of its social\r\nclasses on the other, there is at any given moment a current and cross\r\ncurrent of various socio-political factors of a national and\r\ninternational character which modify and sometimes completely reverse\r\nthe political expression of economic relations. The industry of the\r\nUnited States is far more advanced than the industry of Russia, while\r\nthe political role of the Russian workingmen, their influence on the\r\npolitical life of their country, the possibilities of their influence on\r\nworld politics in the near future, are incomparably greater than those\r\nof the American proletariat.\r\n\r\nIn his recent work on the American workingman, Kautsky arrives at the\r\nconclusion that there is no immediate and direct dependence between the\r\npolitical strength of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat of a country\r\non one hand and its industrial development on the other. \"Here are two\r\ncountries,\" he writes, \"diametrically opposed to each other: in one of\r\nthem, one of the elements of modern industry is developed out of\r\nproportion, i.e., out of keeping with the stage of capitalistic\r\ndevelopment; in the other, another; in America it is the class of\r\ncapitalists; in Russia, the class of labor. In America there is more\r\nground than elsewhere to speak of the dictatorship of capital, while\r\nnowhere has labor gained as much influence as in Russia, and this\r\ninfluence is bound to grow, as Russia has only recently entered the\r\nperiod of modern class struggle.\" Kautsky then proceeds to state that\r\nGermany can, to a certain degree, study her future from the present\r\nconditions in Russia, then he continues: \"It is strange to think that it\r\nis the Russian proletariat which shows us our future as far as, not the\r\norganization of capital, but the protest of the working class is\r\nconcerned. Russia is the most backward of all the great states of the\r\ncapitalist world. This may seem to be in contradiction with the economic\r\ninterpretation of history which considers economic strength the basis of\r\npolitical development. This is, however, not true. It contradicts only\r\nthat kind of economic interpretation of history which is being painted\r\nby our opponents and critics who see in it not a _method of analysis_,\r\nbut a _ready pattern_.\"[2] These lines ought to be recommended to those\r\nof our native Marxians who substitute for an independent analysis of\r\nsocial relations a deduction from texts selected for all emergencies of\r\nlife. No one can compromise Marxism as shamefully as these bureaucrats\r\nof Marxism do.\r\n\r\n     [2] K. Kautsky, _The American and the Russian Workingman_.\r\n\r\nIn Kautsky's estimation, Russia is characterized, economically, by a\r\ncomparatively low level of capitalistic development; politically, by a\r\nweakness of the capitalistic bourgeoisie and by a great strength of the\r\nworking class. This results in the fact, that \"the struggle for the\r\ninterests of Russia as a whole has become the task of _the only powerful\r\nclass in Russia_, industrial labor. This is the reason why labor has\r\ngained such a tremendous political importance. This is the reason why\r\nthe struggle of Russia against the polyp of absolutism which is\r\nstrangling the country, turned out to be a single combat of absolutism\r\nagainst industrial labor, a combat where the peasantry can lend\r\nconsiderable assistance without, however, being able to play a leading\r\nrole.[3]\r\n\r\n     [3] D. Mendeleyer, _Russian Realities_, 1906, p. 10.\r\n\r\nAre we not warranted in our conclusion that the \"man\" will sooner gain\r\npolitical supremacy in Russia than his \"master\"?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are two sorts of political optimism. One overestimates the\r\nadvantages and the strength of the revolution and strives towards ends\r\nunattainable under given conditions. The other consciously limits the\r\ntask of the revolution, drawing a line which the very logic of the\r\nsituation will compel him to overstep.\r\n\r\nYou can draw limits to all the problems of the revolution by asserting\r\nthat this is a bourgeois revolution in its objective aims and inevitable\r\nresults, and you can close your eyes to the fact that the main figure in\r\nthis revolution is the working class which is being moved towards\r\npolitical supremacy by the very course of events.\r\n\r\nYou can reassure yourself by saying that in the course of a bourgeois\r\nrevolution the political supremacy of the working class can be only a\r\npassing episode, and you can forget that, once in power, the working\r\nclass will offer desperate resistance, refusing to yield unless\r\ncompelled to do so by armed force.\r\n\r\nYou can reassure yourself by saying that social conditions in Russia are\r\nnot yet ripe for a Socialist order, and you can overlook the fact that,\r\nonce master of the situation, the working class would be compelled by\r\nthe very logic of its situation to organize national economy under the\r\nmanagement of the state.\r\n\r\nThe term _bourgeois revolution_, a general sociological definition,\r\ngives no solution to the numerous political and tactical problems,\r\ncontradictions and difficulties which are being created by the mechanism\r\nof a _given_ bourgeois revolution.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of a bourgeois revolution at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, whose objective was the political supremacy of capital, the\r\ndictatorship of the _Sans-Culottes_ turned out to be a fact. This\r\ndictatorship was not a passing episode, it gave its stamp to a whole\r\ncentury that followed the revolution, though it was soon crushed by the\r\nlimitations of the revolution.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of a revolution at the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury, which is also a bourgeois revolution in its immediate objective\r\naims, there looms up a prospect of an inevitable, or at least possible,\r\nsupremacy of the working class in the near future. That this supremacy\r\nshould not turn out to be a passing episode, as many a realistic\r\nPhilistine may hope, is a task which the working class will have at\r\nheart. It is, then, legitimate to ask: is it inevitable that the\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat should clash against the limitations of\r\na bourgeois revolution and collapse, or is it not possible that under\r\ngiven _international conditions_ it may open a way for an ultimate\r\nvictory by crushing those very limitations? Hence a tactical problem:\r\nshould we consciously strive toward a labor government as the\r\ndevelopment of the revolution will bring us nearer to that stage, or\r\nshould we look upon political power as upon a calamity which the\r\nbourgeois revolution is ready to inflict upon the workingmen, and which\r\nit is best to avoid?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PROLETARIAT IN POWER AND THE PEASANTRY\r\n\r\nIn case of a victorious revolution, political power passes into the\r\nhands of the class that has played in it a dominant role, in other\r\nwords, it passes into the hands of the working class. Of course,\r\nrevolutionary representatives of non-proletarian social groups may not\r\nbe excluded from the government; sound politics demands that the\r\nproletariat should call into the government influential leaders of the\r\nlower middle class, the intelligentzia and the peasants. The problem is,\r\n_Who will give substance to the politics of the government, who will\r\nform in it a homogeneous majority?_ It is one thing when the government\r\ncontains a labor majority, which representatives of other democratic\r\ngroups of the people are allowed to join; it is another, when the\r\ngovernment has an outspoken bourgeois-democratic character where labor\r\nrepresentatives are allowed to participate in the capacity of more or\r\nless honorable hostages.\r\n\r\nThe policies of the liberal capitalist bourgeoisie, notwithstanding all\r\ntheir vacillations, retreats and treacheries, are of a definite\r\ncharacter. The policies of the proletariat are of a still more definite,\r\noutspoken character. The policies of the intelligentzia, however, a\r\nresult of intermediate social position and political flexibility of this\r\ngroup; the politics of the peasants, a result of the social\r\nheterogeneity, intermediate position, and primitiveness of this class;\r\nthe politics of the lower middle class, a result of muddle-headedness,\r\nintermediate position and complete want of political traditions,--can\r\nnever be clear, determined, and firm. It must necessarily be subject to\r\nunexpected turns, to uncertainties and surprises.\r\n\r\nTo imagine a revolutionary democratic government without representatives\r\nof labor is to see the absurdity of such a situation. A refusal of labor\r\nto participate in a revolutionary government would make the very\r\nexistence of that government impossible, and would be tantamount to a\r\nbetrayal of the cause of the revolution. A participation of labor in a\r\nrevolutionary government, however, is admissible, both from the\r\nviewpoint of objective probability and subjective desirability, _only\r\nin the role of a leading dominant power_. Of course, you can call such a\r\ngovernment \"dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry,\"\r\n\"dictatorship of the proletariat, the peasantry, and the\r\nintelligentzia,\" or \"a revolutionary government of the workingmen and\r\nthe lower middle class.\" This question will still remain: Who has the\r\nhegemony in the government and through it in the country? _When we speak\r\nof a labor government we mean that the hegemony belongs to the working\r\nclass._\r\n\r\nThe proletariat will be able to hold this position under one condition:\r\nif it broadens the basis of the revolution.\r\n\r\nMany elements of the working masses, especially among the rural\r\npopulation, will be drawn into the revolution and receive their\r\npolitical organization only after the first victories of the revolution,\r\nwhen the revolutionary vanguard, the city proletariat, shall have seized\r\ngovernmental power. Under such conditions, the work of propaganda and\r\norganization will be conducted through state agencies. Legislative work\r\nitself will become a powerful means of revolutionizing the masses. The\r\nburden thrust upon the shoulders of the working class by the\r\npeculiarities of our social and historical development, the burden of\r\ncompleting a bourgeois revolution by means of labor struggle, will thus\r\nconfront the proletariat with difficulties of enormous magnitude; on the\r\nother hand, however, it will offer the working class, at least in the\r\nfirst period, unusual opportunities. This will be seen in the relations\r\nbetween the proletariat and the peasants.\r\n\r\nIn the revolutions of 1789-93, and 1848, governmental power passed from\r\nabsolutism into the hands of the moderate bourgeois elements which\r\nemancipated the peasants before revolutionary democracy succeeded or\r\neven attempted to get into power. The emancipated peasantry then lost\r\ninterest in the political ventures of the \"city-gentlemen,\" i.e., in the\r\nfurther course of the revolution; it formed the dead ballast of \"order,\"\r\nthe foundation of all social \"stability,\" betraying the revolution,\r\nsupporting a Cesarian or ultra-absolutist reaction.\r\n\r\nThe Russian revolution is opposed to a bourgeois constitutional order\r\nwhich would be able to solve the most primitive problems of democracy.\r\nThe Russian revolution will be against it for a long period to come.\r\nReformers of a bureaucratic brand, such as Witte and Stolypin, can do\r\nnothing for the peasants, as their \"enlightened\" efforts are continually\r\nnullified by their own struggle for existence. The fate of the most\r\nelementary interests of the peasantry--the entire peasantry as a\r\nclass--is, therefore, closely connected with the fate of the revolution,\r\ni.e., with the fate of the proletariat.\r\n\r\n_Once in power, the proletariat will appear before the peasantry as its\r\nliberator._\r\n\r\nProletarian rule will mean not only democratic equality, free\r\nself-government, shifting the burden of taxation on the propertied\r\nclasses, dissolution of the army among the revolutionary people,\r\nabolition of compulsory payments for the Church, but also recognition of\r\nall revolutionary changes made by the peasants in agrarian relations\r\n(seizures of land). These changes will be taken by the proletariat as a\r\nstarting point for further legislative measures in agriculture. Under\r\nsuch conditions, the Russian peasantry will be interested in upholding\r\nthe proletarian rule (\"labor democracy\"), at least in the first, most\r\ndifficult period, not less so than were the French peasants interested\r\nin upholding the military rule of Napoleon Bonaparte who by force\r\nguaranteed to the new owners the integrity of their land shares.\r\n\r\nBut is it not possible that the peasants will remove the workingmen\r\nfrom their positions and take their place? No, this can never happen.\r\nThis would be in contradiction to all historical experiences. History\r\nhas convincingly shown that the peasantry is incapable of an independent\r\npolitical role.\r\n\r\nThe history of capitalism is the history of subordination of the village\r\nby the city. Industrial development had made the continuation of feudal\r\nrelations in agriculture impossible. Yet the peasantry had not produced\r\na class which could live up to the revolutionary task of destroying\r\nfeudalism. It was the city which made rural population dependent on\r\ncapital, and which produced revolutionary forces to assume political\r\nhegemony over the village, there to complete revolutionary changes in\r\ncivic and political relations. In the course of further development, the\r\nvillage becomes completely enslaved by capital, and the villagers by\r\ncapitalistic political parties, which revive feudalism in parliamentary\r\npolitics, making the peasantry their political domain, the ground for\r\ntheir preelection huntings. Modern peasantry is driven by the fiscal and\r\nmilitaristic system of the state into the clutches of usurers' capital,\r\nwhile state-clergy, state-schools and barrack depravity drive it into\r\nthe clutches of usurers' politics.\r\n\r\nThe Russian bourgeoisie yielded all revolutionary positions to the\r\nRussian proletariat. It will have to yield also the revolutionary\r\nhegemony over the peasants. Once the proletariat becomes master of the\r\nsituation, conditions will impel the peasants to uphold the policies of\r\na labor democracy. They may do it with no more political understanding\r\nthan they uphold a bourgeois regime. The difference is that while each\r\nbourgeois party in possession of the peasants' vote uses its power to\r\nrob the peasants, to betray their confidence and to leave their\r\nexpectations unfulfilled, in the worst case to give way to another\r\ncapitalist party, the working class, backed by the peasantry, will put\r\nall forces into operation to raise the cultural level of the village and\r\nto broaden the political understanding of the peasants.\r\n\r\nOur attitude towards the idea of a \"dictatorship of the proletariat and\r\nthe peasantry\" is now quite clear. It is not a question whether we think\r\nit \"admissible\" or not, whether we \"wish\" or we \"do not wish\" this form\r\nof political cooeperation. In our opinion, it simply cannot be realized,\r\nat least in its direct meaning. Such a cooeperation presupposes that\r\neither the peasantry has identified itself with one of the existing\r\nbourgeois parties, or it has formed a powerful party of its own. Neither\r\nis possible, as we have tried to point out.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPROLETARIAN RULE\r\n\r\nThe proletariat can get into power only at a moment of national\r\nupheaval, of sweeping national enthusiasm. The proletariat assumes power\r\nas a revolutionary representative of the people, as a recognized leader\r\nin the fight against absolutism and barbaric feudalism. Having assumed\r\npower, however, the proletariat will open a new era, an era of positive\r\nlegislation, of revolutionary politics, and this is the point where its\r\npolitical supremacy as an avowed spokesman of the nation may become\r\nendangered.\r\n\r\nThe first measures of the proletariat--the cleansing of the Augean\r\nstables of the old regime and the driving away of their\r\ninhabitants--will find active support of the entire nation whatever the\r\nliberal castraters may tell us of the power of some prejudices among the\r\nmasses. The work of political cleansing will be accompanied by\r\ndemocratic reorganization of all social and political relations. The\r\nlabor government, impelled by immediate needs and requirements, will\r\nhave to look into all kinds of relations and activities among the\r\npeople. It will have to throw out of the army and the administration all\r\nthose who had stained their hands with the blood of the people; it will\r\nhave to disband all the regiments that had polluted themselves with\r\ncrimes against the people. This work will have to be done immediately,\r\nlong before the establishment of an elective responsible administration\r\nand before the organization of a popular militia. This, however, will be\r\nonly a beginning. Labor democracy will soon be confronted by the\r\nproblems of a normal workday, the agrarian relations and unemployment.\r\nThe legislative solution of those problems will show the _class\r\ncharacter_ of the labor government. It will tend to weaken the\r\nrevolutionary bond between the proletariat and the nation; it will give\r\nthe economic differentiation among the peasants a political expression.\r\nAntagonism between the component parts of the nation will grow step by\r\nstep as the policies of the labor government become more outspoken, lose\r\ntheir general democratic character and become _class policies_.\r\n\r\nThe lack of individualistic bourgeois traditions and anti-proletarian\r\nprejudices among the peasants and the intelligentzia will help the\r\nproletariat assume power. It must not be forgotten, however, that this\r\nlack of prejudices is based not on political understanding, but on\r\npolitical barbarism, on social shapelessness, primitiveness, and lack of\r\ncharacter. These are all qualities which can hardly guarantee support\r\nfor an active, consistent proletarian rule.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of the remnants of feudalism in agrarian relations will be\r\nsupported by all the peasants who are now oppressed by the landlords. A\r\nprogressive income tax will be supported by an overwhelming majority of\r\nthe peasants. Yet, legislative measures in defense of the rural\r\nproletariat (farm hands) will find no active support among the majority,\r\nand will meet with active opposition on the part of a minority of the\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat will be compelled to introduce class struggle into the\r\nvillage and thus to destroy that slight community of interests which\r\nundoubtedly unites the peasants as a whole. In its next steps, the\r\nproletariat will have to seek for support by helping the poor villagers\r\nagainst the rich, the rural proletariat against the agrarian\r\nbourgeoisie. This will alienate the majority of the peasants from labor\r\ndemocracy. Relations between village and city will become strained. The\r\npeasantry as a whole will become politically indifferent. The peasant\r\nminority will actively oppose proletarian rule. This will influence part\r\nof the intellectuals and the lower middle class of the cities.\r\n\r\nTwo features of proletarian politics are bound particularly to meet with\r\nthe opposition of labor's allies: _Collectivism_ and _Internationalism_.\r\nThe strong adherence of the peasants to private ownership, the\r\nprimitiveness of their political conceptions, the limitations of the\r\nvillage horizon, its distance from world-wide political connections and\r\ninterdependences, are terrific obstacles in the way of revolutionary\r\nproletarian rule.\r\n\r\nTo imagine that Social-Democracy participates in the provisional\r\ngovernment, playing a leading role in the period of revolutionary\r\ndemocratic reconstruction, insisting on the most radical reforms\r\nand all the time enjoying the aid and support of the organized\r\nproletariat,--only to step aside when the democratic program is put into\r\noperation, to leave the completed building at the disposal of the\r\nbourgeois parties and thus to open an era of parliamentary politics\r\nwhere Social-Democracy forms only a party of opposition,--to imagine\r\nthis would mean to compromise the very idea of a labor government. It is\r\nimpossible to imagine anything of the kind, not because it is \"against\r\nprinciples\"--such abstract reasoning is devoid of any substance--but\r\nbecause it is _not real_, it is the worst kind of Utopianism, it is the\r\nrevolutionary Utopianism of Philistines.\r\n\r\nOur distinction between a minimum and maximum program has a great and\r\nprofound meaning only under bourgeois rule. The very fact of bourgeois\r\nrule eliminates from our minimum program all demands incompatible with\r\nprivate ownership of the means of production. Those demands form the\r\nsubstance of a Socialist revolution, and they presuppose a dictatorship\r\nof the proletariat. The moment, however, a revolutionary government is\r\ndominated by a Socialist majority, the distinction between minimum and\r\nmaximum programs loses its meaning both as a question of principle and\r\nas a practical policy. _Under no condition will a proletarian government\r\nbe able to keep within the limits of this distinction._\r\n\r\nLet us take the case of an eight hour workday. It is a well established\r\nfact that an eight hour workday does not contradict the capitalist\r\norder; it is, therefore, well within the limits of the Social-Democratic\r\nminimum program. Imagine, however, its realization in a revolutionary\r\nperiod, when all social passions are at the boiling point. An eight hour\r\nworkday law would necessarily meet with stubborn and organized\r\nopposition on the part of the capitalists--let us say in the form of a\r\nlock-out and closing down of factories and plants. Hundreds of thousands\r\nof workingmen would be thrown into the streets. What ought the\r\nrevolutionary government to do? A bourgeois government, however radical,\r\nwould never allow matters to go as far as that. It would be powerless\r\nagainst the closing of factories and plants. It would be compelled to\r\nmake concessions. The eight hour workday would not be put into\r\noperation; the revolts of the workingmen would be put down by force of\r\narms....\r\n\r\nUnder the political domination of the proletariat, the introduction of\r\nan eight hour workday must have totally different consequences. The\r\nclosing down of factories and plants cannot be the reason for increasing\r\nlabor hours by a government which represents not capital, but labor, and\r\nwhich refuses to act as an \"impartial\" mediator, the way bourgeois\r\ndemocracy does. A labor government would have only one way out--to\r\nexpropriate the closed factories and plants and to organize their work\r\non a public basis.\r\n\r\nOr let us take another example. A proletarian government must\r\nnecessarily take decisive steps to solve the problem of unemployment.\r\nRepresentatives of labor in a revolutionary government can by no means\r\nmeet the demands of the unemployed by saying that this is a bourgeois\r\nrevolution. Once, however, the state ventures to eliminate\r\nunemployment--no matter how--a tremendous gain in the economic power of\r\nthe proletariat is accomplished. The capitalists whose pressure on the\r\nworking class was based on the existence of a reserve army of labor,\r\nwill soon realize that they are powerless _economically_. It will be the\r\ntask of the government to doom them also to _political_ oblivion.\r\n\r\nMeasures against unemployment mean also measures to secure means of\r\nsubsistence for strikers. The government will have to undertake them, if\r\nit is anxious not to undermine the very foundation of its existence.\r\nNothing will remain for the capitalists but to declare a lock-out, to\r\nclose down factories and plants. Since capitalists can wait longer than\r\nlabor in case of interrupted production, nothing will remain for a labor\r\ngovernment but to meet a general lock-out by expropriating the factories\r\nand plants and by introducing in the biggest of them state or communal\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nIn agriculture, similar problems will present themselves through the\r\nvery fact of land-expropriation. We cannot imagine a proletarian\r\ngovernment expropriating large private estates with agricultural\r\nproduction on a large scale, cutting them into pieces and selling them\r\nto small owners. For it the only open way is to organize in such estates\r\ncooeperative production under communal or state management. This,\r\nhowever, _is the way of Socialism_.\r\n\r\nSocial-Democracy can never assume power under a double obligation: to\r\nput the _entire_ minimum program into operation for the sake of the\r\nproletariat, and to keep strictly _within the limits_ of this program,\r\nfor the sake of the bourgeoisie. Such a double obligation could never be\r\nfulfilled. Participating in the government, not as powerless hostages,\r\nbut as a leading force, the representatives of labor _eo ipso_ break the\r\nline between the minimum and maximum program. _Collectivism becomes the\r\norder of the day._ At which point the proletariat will be stopped on\r\nits march in this direction, depends upon the constellation of forces,\r\nnot upon the original purpose of the proletarian Party.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, absurd to speak of a _specific_ character of\r\nproletarian dictatorship (or a dictatorship of the proletariat _and_ the\r\npeasantry) within a bourgeois revolution, viz., a _purely democratic_\r\ndictatorship. The working class can never secure the democratic\r\ncharacter of its dictatorship without overstepping the limits of its\r\ndemocratic program. Illusions to the contrary may become a handicap.\r\nThey would compromise Social-Democracy from the start.\r\n\r\nOnce the proletariat assumes power, it will fight for it to the end. One\r\nof the means to secure and solidify its power will be propaganda and\r\norganization, particularly in the village; another means will be a\r\n_policy of Collectivism_. Collectivism is not only dictated by the very\r\nposition of the Social-Democratic Party as the party in power, but it\r\nbecomes imperative as a means to secure this position through the active\r\nsupport of the working class.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen our Socialist press first formulated the idea of a _Permanent\r\nRevolution_ which should lead from the liquidation of absolutism and\r\ncivic bondage to a Socialist order through a series of ever growing\r\nsocial conflicts, uprisings of ever new masses, unremitting attacks of\r\nthe proletariat on the political and economic privileges of the\r\ngoverning classes, our \"progressive\" press started a unanimous indignant\r\nuproar. Oh, they had suffered enough, those gentlemen of the\r\n\"progressive\" press; this nuisance, however, was too much. Revolution,\r\nthey said, is not a thing that can be made \"legal!\" Extraordinary\r\nmeasures are allowable only on extraordinary occasions. The aim of the\r\nrevolutionary movement, they asserted, was not to make the revolution go\r\non forever, but to bring it as soon as possible into the channels of\r\n_law_, etc., etc. The more radical representatives of the same\r\ndemocratic bourgeoisie do not attempt to oppose the revolution from the\r\nstandpoint of completed constitutional \"achievements\": tame as they are,\r\nthey understand how hopeless it is to fight the proletariat revolution\r\nwith the weapon of parliamentary cretinism _in advance_ of the\r\nestablishment of parliamentarism itself. They, therefore, choose another\r\nway. They forsake the standpoint of law, but take the standpoint of what\r\nthey deem to be facts,--the standpoint of historic \"possibilities,\" the\r\nstandpoint of political \"realism,\"--even ... even the standpoint of\r\n\"Marxism.\" It was Antonio, the pious Venetian bourgeois, who made the\r\nstriking observation:\r\n\r\n        Mark you this, Bassanio,\r\n    The devil can cite scriptures for his purpose.\r\n\r\nThose gentlemen not only consider the idea of labor government in Russia\r\nfantastic, but they repudiate the very probability of a Social\r\nrevolution in Europe in the near historic epoch. The necessary\r\n\"prerequisites\" are not yet in existence, is their assertion.\r\n\r\nIs it so? It is, of course, not our purpose to set a time for a Social\r\nrevolution. What we attempt here is to put the Social revolution into a\r\nproper historic perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPREREQUISITES TO SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nMarxism turned Socialism into a science. This does not prevent some\r\n\"Marxians\" from turning Marxism into a Utopia.\r\n\r\n    [Trotzky then proceeds to find logical flaws in the arguments of N.\r\n    Roshkov, a Russian Marxist, who had made the assertion that Russia\r\n    was not yet ripe for Socialism, as her level of industrial technique\r\n    and the class-consciousness of her working masses were not yet high\r\n    enough to make Socialist production and distribution possible. Then\r\n    he goes back to what he calls \"prerequisites to Socialism,\" which in\r\n    his opinion are: (1) development of industrial technique; (2)\r\n    concentration of production; (3) social consciousness of the masses.\r\n    In order that Socialism become possible, he says, it is not\r\n    necessary that each of these prerequisites be developed to its\r\n    logically conceivable limit.]\r\n\r\nAll those processes (development of technique, concentration of\r\nproduction, growth of mass-consciousness) go on simultaneously, and not\r\nonly do they help and stimulate each other, but they also _hamper and\r\nlimit_ each other's development. Each of the processes of a higher order\r\npresupposes the development of another process of a lower order, yet the\r\nfull development of any of them is incompatible with the full\r\ndevelopment of the others.\r\n\r\nThe logical limit of technical development is undoubtedly a perfect\r\nautomatic mechanism which takes in raw materials from natural resources\r\nand lays them down at the feet of men as ready objects of consumption.\r\nWere not capitalism limited by relations between classes and by the\r\nconsequences of those relations, the class struggle, one would be\r\nwarranted in his assumption that industrial technique, having approached\r\nthe ideal of one great automatic mechanism within the limits of\r\ncapitalistic economy, _eo ipso_ dismisses capitalism.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of production which is an outgrowth of economic\r\ncompetition has an inherent tendency to throw the entire population into\r\nthe working class. Taking this tendency apart from all the others, one\r\nwould be warranted in his assumption that capitalism would ultimately\r\nturn the majority of the people into a reserve army of paupers, lodged\r\nin prisons. This process, however, is being checked by revolutionary\r\nchanges which are inevitable under a certain relationship between social\r\nforces. It will be checked long before it has reached its logical limit.\r\n\r\nAnd the same thing is true in relation to social mass-consciousness.\r\nThis consciousness undoubtedly grows with the experiences of every day\r\nstruggle and through the conscious efforts of Socialist parties.\r\nIsolating this process from all others, we can imagine it reaching a\r\nstage where the overwhelming majority of the people are encompassed by\r\nprofessional and political organizations, united in a feeling of\r\nsolidarity and in identity of purpose. Were this process allowed to grow\r\nquantitatively without changing in quality, Socialism might be\r\nestablished peacefully, through a unanimous compact of the citizens of\r\nthe twenty-first or twenty-second Century. The historic prerequisites to\r\nSocialism, however, do not develop in isolation from each other; _they\r\nlimit each other_; reaching a certain stage, which is determined by many\r\ncircumstances, but which is very far from their mathematical limits,\r\nthey undergo a qualitative change, and in their complex combination they\r\nproduce what we call a Social revolution.\r\n\r\nLet us take the last mentioned process, the growth of social\r\nmass-consciousness. This growth takes place not in academies, but in the\r\nvery life of modern capitalistic society, on the basis of incessant\r\nclass struggle. The growth of proletarian class consciousness makes\r\nclass struggles undergo a transformation; it deepens them; it puts a\r\nfoundation of principle under them, thus provoking a corresponding\r\nreaction on the part of the governing classes. The struggle between\r\nproletariat and bourgeoisie has its own logic; it must become more and\r\nmore acute and bring things to a climax long before the time when\r\nconcentration of production has become predominant in economic life. It\r\nis evident, further, that the growth of the political consciousness of\r\nthe proletariat is closely related with its numerical strength;\r\nproletarian dictatorship presupposes great numbers of workingmen, strong\r\nenough to overcome the resistance of the bourgeois counter-revolution.\r\nThis, however, does not imply that the overwhelming majority of the\r\npeople must consist of proletarians, or that the overwhelming majority\r\nof proletarians must consist of convinced Socialists. Of course, the\r\nfighting revolutionary army of the proletariat must by all means be\r\nstronger than the fighting counter-revolutionary army of capital; yet\r\nbetween those two camps there may be a great number of doubtful or\r\nindifferent elements who are not actively helping the revolution, but\r\nare rather inclined to desire its ultimate victory. The proletarian\r\npolicy must take all this into account.\r\n\r\nThis is possible only where there is a hegemony of industry over\r\nagriculture, and a hegemony of the city over the village.\r\n\r\nLet us review the prerequisites to Socialism in the order of their\r\ndiminishing generality and increasing complexity.\r\n\r\n1. Socialism is not only a problem of equal distribution, but also a\r\nproblem of well organized production. Socialistic, i.e., cooeperative\r\nproduction on a large scale is possible only where economic progress has\r\ngone so far as to make a large undertaking more productive than a small\r\none. The greater the advantages of a large undertaking over a small one,\r\ni.e., the higher the industrial technique, the greater must be the\r\neconomic advantages of socialized production, the higher, consequently,\r\nmust be the cultural level of the people to enable them to enjoy equal\r\ndistribution based on well organized production.\r\n\r\nThis first prerequisite of Socialism has been in existence for many\r\nyears. Ever since division of labor has been established in\r\nmanufactories; ever since manufactories have been superseded by\r\nfactories employing a system of machines,--large undertakings become\r\nmore and more profitable, and consequently their socialization would\r\nmake the people more prosperous. There would have been no gain in making\r\nall the artisans' shops common property of the artisans; whereas the\r\nseizure of a manufactory by its workers, or the seizure of a factory by\r\nits hired employees, or the seizure of all means of modern production by\r\nthe people must necessarily improve their economic conditions,--the more\r\nso, the further the process of economic concentration has advanced.\r\n\r\nAt present, social division of labor on one hand, machine production on\r\nthe other have reached a stage where the only cooeperative organization\r\nthat can make adequate use of the advantages of collectivist economy, is\r\nthe State. It is hardly conceivable that Socialist production would\r\ncontent itself with the area of the state. Economic and political\r\nmotives would necessarily impel it to overstep the boundaries of\r\nindividual states.\r\n\r\nThe world has been in possession of technical equipment for collective\r\nproduction--in one or another form--for the last hundred or two hundred\r\nyears. _Technically_, Socialism is profitable not only on a national,\r\nbut also to a large extent on an international scale. Why then have all\r\nattempts at organizing Socialist communities failed? Why has\r\nconcentration of production manifested its advantages all through the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries not in Socialistic, but in\r\ncapitalistic forms? The reason is that there was no social force ready\r\nand able to introduce Socialism.\r\n\r\n2. Here we pass from the prerequisite of industrial technique to the\r\n_socio-economic_ prerequisite, which is less general, but more complex.\r\nWere our society not an antagonistic society composed of classes, but a\r\nhomogeneous partnership of men consciously selecting the best economic\r\nsystem, a mere calculation as to the advantages of Socialism would\r\nsuffice to make people start Socialistic reconstruction. Our society,\r\nhowever, harbors in itself opposing interests. What is good for one\r\nclass, is bad for another. Class selfishness clashes against class\r\nselfishness; class selfishness impairs the interests of the whole. To\r\nmake Socialism possible, a social power has to arise in the midst of the\r\nantagonistic classes of capitalist society, a power objectively placed\r\nin a position to be interested in the establishment of Socialism, at\r\nthe same time strong enough to overcome all opposing interests and\r\nhostile resistance. It is one of the principal merits of scientific\r\nSocialism to have discovered such a social power in the person of the\r\nproletariat, and to have shown that this class, growing with the growth\r\nof capitalism, can find its salvation only in Socialism; that it is\r\nbeing moved towards Socialism by its very position, and that the\r\ndoctrine of Socialism in the presence of a capitalist society must\r\nnecessarily become the ideology of the proletariat.\r\n\r\nHow far, then, must the social differentiation have gone to warrant the\r\nassertion that the second prerequisite is an accomplished fact? In other\r\nwords, what must be the numerical strength of the proletariat? Must it\r\nbe one-half, two-thirds, or nine-tenths of the people? It is utterly\r\nfutile to try and formulate this second prerequisite of Socialism\r\narithmetically. An attempt to express the strength of the proletariat in\r\nmere numbers, besides being schematic, would imply a series of\r\ndifficulties. Whom should we consider a proletarian? Is the\r\nhalf-paupered peasant a proletarian? Should we count with the\r\nproletariat those hosts of the city reserve who, on one hand, fall into\r\nthe ranks of the parasitic proletariat of beggars and thieves, and, on\r\nthe other hand, fill the streets in the capacity of peddlers, i.e., of\r\nparasites on the economic body as a whole? It is not easy to answer\r\nthese questions.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the proletariat is based not only on its numbers, but\r\nprimarily on its role in industry. The political supremacy of the\r\nbourgeoisie is founded on economic power. Before it manages to take over\r\nthe authority of the state, it concentrates in its hands the national\r\nmeans of production; hence its specific weight. The proletariat will\r\npossess no means of production of its own before the Social revolution.\r\nIts social power depends upon the circumstance that the means of\r\nproduction in possession of the bourgeoisie can be put into motion only\r\nby the hands of the proletariat. From the bourgeois viewpoint, the\r\nproletariat is also one of the means of production, forming, in\r\ncombination with the others, a unified mechanism. Yet the proletariat is\r\nthe only non-automatic part of this mechanism, and can never be made\r\nautomatic, notwithstanding all efforts. This puts the proletariat into a\r\nposition to be able to stop the functioning of the national economic\r\nbody, partially or wholly--through the medium of partial or general\r\nstrikes.\r\n\r\nHence it is evident that, the numerical strength of the proletariat\r\nbeing equal, its importance is proportional to the mass of the means of\r\nproduction it puts into motion: the proletarian of a big industrial\r\nconcern represents--other conditions being equal--a greater social unit\r\nthan an artisan's employee; a city workingman represents a greater unit\r\nthan a proletarian of the village. In other words, the political role of\r\nthe proletariat is greater in proportion as large industries predominate\r\nover small industries, industry predominates over agriculture, and the\r\ncity over the village.\r\n\r\nAt a period in the history of Germany or England when the proletariats\r\nof those countries formed the same percentage to the total population as\r\nthe proletariat in present day Russia, they did not possess the same\r\nsocial weight as the Russian proletariat of to-day. They could not\r\npossess it, because their objective importance in economic life was\r\ncomparatively smaller. The social weight of the cities represents the\r\nsame phenomenon. At a time when the city population of Germany formed\r\nonly 15 per cent. of the total nation, as is the case in present-day\r\nRussia, the German cities were far from equaling our cities in economic\r\nand political importance. The concentration of big industries and\r\ncommercial enterprises in the cities, and the establishment of closer\r\nrelations between city and country through a system of railways, has\r\ngiven the modern cities an importance far exceeding the mere volume of\r\ntheir population. Moreover, the growth of their importance runs ahead of\r\nthe growth of their population, and the growth of the latter runs ahead\r\nof the natural increase of the entire population of the country. In\r\n1848, the number of artisans, masters and their employees, in Italy was\r\n15 per cent. of the population, the same as the percentage of the\r\nproletariat, including artisans, in Russia of to-day. Their importance,\r\nhowever, was far less than that of the Russian industrial proletariat.\r\n\r\nThe question is not, how strong the proletariat is numerically, but what\r\nis its position in the general economy of a country.\r\n\r\n    [The author then quotes figures showing the numbers of wage-earners\r\n    and industrial proletarians in Germany, Belgium and England: in\r\n    Germany, in 1895, 12.5 millions proletarians; in Belgium 1.8\r\n    millions, or 60 per cent. of all the persons who make a living\r\n    independently; in England 12.5 millions.]\r\n\r\nIn the leading European countries, city population numerically\r\npredominates over the rural population. Infinitely greater is its\r\npredominance through the aggregate of means of production represented by\r\nit, and through the qualities of its human material. The city attracts\r\nthe most energetic, able and intelligent elements of the country.\r\n\r\nThus we arrive at the conclusion that economic evolution--the growth of\r\nindustry, the growth of large enterprises, the growth of cities, the\r\ngrowth of the proletariat, especially the growth of the industrial\r\nproletariat--have already prepared the arena not only for the _struggle_\r\nof the proletariat for political power, but also for the _conquest_ of\r\nthat power.\r\n\r\n3. Here we approach the third prerequisite to Socialism, the\r\n_dictatorship of the proletariat_.\r\n\r\nPolitics is the plane where objective prerequisites intersect with\r\nsubjective. On the basis of certain technical and socio-economic\r\nconditions, a class puts before itself a definite task--to seize power.\r\nIn pursuing this task, it unites its forces, it gauges the forces of the\r\nenemy, it weighs the circumstances. Yet, not even here is the\r\nproletariat absolutely free: besides subjective moments, such as\r\nunderstanding, readiness, initiative which have a logic of their own,\r\nthere are a number of objective moments interfering with the policies of\r\nthe proletariat, such are the policies of the governing classes, state\r\ninstitutions (the army, the class-school, the state-church),\r\ninternational relations, etc.\r\n\r\nLet us first turn our attention to the subjective moment; let us ask,\r\n_Is the proletariat ready for a Socialist change?_ It is not enough that\r\ndevelopment of technique should make Socialist economy profitable from\r\nthe viewpoint of the productivity of national labor; it is not enough\r\nthat social differentiation, based on technical progress, should create\r\nthe proletariat, as a class objectively interested in Socialism. It is\r\nof prime importance that this class should _understand_ its objective\r\ninterests. It is necessary that this class should _see_ in Socialism the\r\nonly way of its emancipation. It is necessary that it should unite into\r\nan army powerful enough to seize governmental power in open combat.\r\n\r\nIt would be a folly to deny the necessity for the preparation of the\r\nproletariat. Only the old Blanquists could stake their hopes in the\r\nsalutary initiative of an organization of conspirators formed\r\nindependently of the masses. Only their antipodes, the anarchists, could\r\nbuild their system on a spontaneous elemental outburst of the masses\r\nwhose results nobody can foresee. When Social-Democracy speaks of\r\nseizing power, it thinks of _a deliberate action of a revolutionary\r\nclass_.\r\n\r\nThere are Socialists-ideologists (ideologists in the wrong sense of the\r\nword, those who turn all things upside down) who speak of preparing the\r\nproletariat for Socialism as a problem of moral regeneration. The\r\nproletariat, they say, and even \"humanity\" in general, must first free\r\nitself from its old selfish nature; altruistic motives must first become\r\npredominant in social life. As we are still very far from this ideal,\r\nthey contend, and as human nature changes very slowly, Socialism appears\r\nto be a problem of remote centuries. This view seems to be very\r\nrealistic, evolutionistic, etc. It is in reality a conglomeration of\r\nhackneyed moralistic considerations.\r\n\r\nThose \"ideologists\" imagine that a Socialist psychology can be acquired\r\nbefore the establishment of Socialism; that in a world ruled by\r\ncapitalism the masses can be imbued with a Socialist psychology.\r\nSocialist psychology as here conceived should not be identified with\r\nSocialist aspirations. The former presupposes the absence of selfish\r\nmotives in economic relations, while the latter are an outcome of the\r\nclass psychology of the proletariat. Class psychology, and Socialist\r\npsychology in a society not split into classes, may have many common\r\nfeatures, yet they differ widely.\r\n\r\nCooeperation in the struggle of the proletariat against exploitation has\r\ndeveloped in the soul of the workingmen beautiful sprouts of idealism,\r\nbrotherly solidarity, a spirit of self-sacrifice. Yet those sprouts\r\ncannot grow and blossom freely within capitalist society: individual\r\nstruggle for existence, the yawning abyss of poverty, differentiations\r\namong the workingmen themselves, the corrupting influence of the\r\nbourgeois parties,--all this interferes with the growth of idealism\r\namong the masses.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is a fact that, while remaining selfish as any of the lower\r\nmiddle class, while not exceeding the average representative of the\r\nbourgeois classes by the \"human\" value of his personality, the average\r\nworkingman learns in the school of life's experience that _his most\r\nprimitive desires and most natural wants can be satisfied only on the\r\ndebris of the capitalist order_.\r\n\r\nIf Socialism should attempt to create a new human nature within the\r\nlimits of the old world, it would be only a new edition of the old\r\nmoralistic Utopias. The task of Socialism is not to create a Socialist\r\npsychology as a prerequisite to Socialism, but to create Socialist\r\nconditions of human life as a prerequisite to a Socialist psychology.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA LABOR GOVERNMENT IN RUSSIA AND SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nThe objective prerequisites of a Social revolution, as we have shown\r\nabove, have been already created by the economic progress of advanced\r\ncapitalist countries. But how about Russia? Is it possible to think that\r\nthe seizure of power by the Russian proletariat would be the beginning\r\nof a Socialist reconstruction of our national economy?\r\n\r\nA year ago we thus answered this question in an article which was\r\nmercilessly bombarded by the organs of both our factions. We wrote:\r\n\r\n\"The workingmen of Paris, says Marx, had not expected miracles from the\r\nCommune. We cannot expect miracles from a proletarian dictatorship now.\r\nGovernmental power is not almighty. It is folly to think that once the\r\nproletariat has seized power, it would abolish capitalism and introduce\r\nsocialism by a number of decrees. The economic system is not a product\r\nof state activity. What the proletariat will be able to do is to\r\nshorten economic evolution towards Collectivism through a series of\r\nenergetic state measures.\r\n\r\n\"The starting point will be the reforms enumerated in our so-called\r\nminimum program. The very situation of the proletariat, however, will\r\ncompel it to move along the way of collectivist practice.\r\n\r\n\"It will be comparatively easy to introduce the eight hour workday and\r\nprogressive taxation, though even here the center of gravity is not the\r\nissuance of a 'decree,' but the organization of its practical\r\napplication. It will be difficult, however,--and here we pass to\r\nCollectivism--to organize production under state management in such\r\nfactories and plants as would be closed down by their owners in protest\r\nagainst the new law.\r\n\r\n\"It will be comparatively simple to issue a law abolishing the right of\r\ninheritance, and to put it into operation. Inheritances in the form of\r\nmoney capital will not embarrass the proletariat and not interfere with\r\nits economy. To be, however, the inheritor of capital invested in land\r\nand industry, would mean for a labor government to organize economic\r\nlife on a public basis.\r\n\r\n\"The same phenomenon, on a vastly larger scale, is represented by the\r\nquestion of expropriation (of land), with or without compensation.\r\nExpropriation with compensation has political advantages, but it is\r\nfinancially difficult; expropriation without compensation has financial\r\nadvantages, but it is difficult politically. Greater than all the other\r\ndifficulties, however, will be those of an economic nature, the\r\ndifficulties of organization.\r\n\r\n\"To repeat: a labor government does not mean a government of miracles.\r\n\r\n\"Public management will begin in those branches where the difficulties\r\nare smallest. Publicly managed enterprises will originally represent\r\nkind of oases linked with private enterprises by the laws of exchange of\r\ncommodities. The wider the field of publicly managed economy will grow,\r\nthe more flagrant its advantages will become, the firmer will become the\r\nposition of the new political regime, and the more determined will be\r\nthe further economic measures of the proletariat. Its measures it will\r\nbase not only on the national productive forces, but also on\r\ninternational technique, in the same way as it bases its revolutionary\r\npolicies not only on the experience of national class relations but also\r\non the entire historic experience of the international proletariat.\"\r\n\r\n_Political supremacy of the proletariat is incompatible with its\r\neconomic slavery._ Whatever may be the banner under which the\r\nproletariat will find itself in possession of power, it will be\r\ncompelled to enter the road of Socialism. It is the greatest Utopia to\r\nthink that the proletariat, brought to the top by the mechanics of a\r\nbourgeois revolution, would be able, even if it wanted, to limit its\r\nmission by creating a republican democratic environment for the social\r\nsupremacy of the bourgeoisie. Political dominance of the proletariat,\r\neven if it were temporary, would extremely weaken the resistance of\r\ncapital which is always in need of state aid, and would give momentous\r\nopportunities to the economic struggle of the proletariat.\r\n\r\nA proletarian regime will immediately take up the agrarian question with\r\nwhich the fate of vast millions of the Russian people is connected. In\r\nsolving this, as many another question, the proletariat will have in\r\nmind the main tendency of its economic policy: to get hold of a widest\r\npossible field for the organization of a Socialist economy. The forms\r\nand the tempo of this policy in the agrarian question will be\r\ndetermined both by the material resources that the proletariat will\r\nbe able to get hold of, and by the necessity to cooerdinate its\r\nactions so as not to drive possible allies into the ranks of the\r\ncounter-revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the _agrarian_ question, i.e., the question of rural\r\neconomy and its social relations, is not covered by the _land_ question\r\nwhich is the question of the forms of land ownership. It is perfectly\r\nclear, however, that the solution of the land question, even if it does\r\nnot determine the future of the agrarian evolution, would undoubtedly\r\ndetermine the future agrarian policy of the proletariat. In other words,\r\nthe use the proletariat will make of the land must be in accord with its\r\ngeneral attitude towards the course and requirements of the agrarian\r\nevolution. The land question will, therefore, be one of the first to\r\ninterest the labor government.\r\n\r\nOne of the solutions, made popular by the Socialist-Revolutionists, is\r\nthe _socialization of the land_. Freed from its European make-up, it\r\nmeans simply \"equal distribution\" of land. This program demands an\r\nexpropriation of all the land, whether it is in possession of landlords,\r\nof peasants on the basis of private property, or it is owned by village\r\ncommunities. It is evident that such expropriation, being one of the\r\nfirst measures of the new government and being started at a time when\r\ncapitalist exchange is still in full swing, would lead the peasants to\r\nbelieve that they are \"victims of the reform.\" One must not forget that\r\nthe peasants have for decades made redemption payments in order to turn\r\ntheir land into private property; many prosperous peasants have made\r\ngreat sacrifices to secure a large portion of land as their private\r\npossession. Should all this land become state property, the most bitter\r\nresistance would be offered by the members of the communities and by\r\nprivate owners. Starting out with a reform of this kind, the government\r\nwould make itself most unpopular among the peasants.\r\n\r\nAnd why should one confiscate the land of the communities and the land\r\nof small private owners? According to the Socialist-Revolutionary\r\nprogram, the only use to be made of the land by the state is to turn it\r\nover to all the peasants and agricultural laborers on the basis of equal\r\ndistribution. This would mean that the confiscated land of the\r\ncommunities and small owners would anyway return to individuals for\r\nprivate cultivation. Consequently, there would be _no economic gain_ in\r\nsuch a confiscation and redistribution. _Politically_, it would be a\r\ngreat blunder on the part of the labor government as it would make the\r\nmasses of peasants hostile to the proletarian leadership of the\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with this program is the question of hired\r\nagricultural labor. Equal distribution presupposes the prohibition of\r\nusing hired labor on farms. This, however, can be only a _consequence_\r\nof economic reforms, it cannot be decreed by a law. It is not enough to\r\nforbid an agricultural capitalist to hire laborers; one must first\r\nsecure agricultural laborers a fair existence; furthermore, this\r\nexistence must be profitable from the viewpoint of social economy. To\r\ndeclare equal distribution of land and to forbid hired labor, would mean\r\nto compel agricultural proletarians to settle on small lots, and to put\r\nthe state under obligation to provide them with implements for their\r\nsocially unprofitable production.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the intervention of the proletariat in the organization\r\nof agriculture ought to express itself not in settling individual\r\nlaborers on individual lots, but in organizing _state or communal\r\nmanagement of large estates_. Later, when socialized production will\r\nhave established itself firmly, a further step will be made towards\r\nsocialization by forbidding hired labor. This will eliminate small\r\ncapitalistic enterprises in agriculture; it will, however, leave\r\nunmolested those private owners who work their land wholly or to a great\r\nextent by the labor of their families. To expropriate such owners can by\r\nno means be a desire of the Socialistic proletariat.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat can never indorse a program of \"equal distribution\"\r\nwhich on one hand demands a useless, purely formal expropriation of\r\nsmall owners, and on the other hand it demands a very real parceling of\r\nlarge estates into small lots. This would be a wasteful undertaking, a\r\npursuance of a reactionary and Utopian plan, and a political harm for\r\nthe revolutionary party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow far, however, can the Socialist policy of the working class advance\r\nin the economic environment of Russia? One thing we can say with perfect\r\nassurance: it will meet political obstacles long before it will be\r\nchecked by the technical backwardness of the country. _Without direct\r\npolitical aid from the European proletariat the working class of Russia\r\nwill not be able to retain its power and to turn its temporary supremacy\r\ninto a permanent Socialist dictatorship._ We cannot doubt this for a\r\nmoment. On the other hand, there is no doubt that a _Socialist\r\nrevolution in the West would allow us to turn the temporary supremacy of\r\nthe working class directly into a Socialist dictatorship_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nEUROPE AND THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nIn June, 1905, we wrote:\r\n\r\n\"More than half a century passed since 1848. Half a century of\r\nunprecedented victories of capitalism all over the world. Half a century\r\nof \"organic\" mutual adaptation of the forces of the bourgeois and the\r\nforces of feudal reaction. Half a century in which the bourgeoisie has\r\nmanifested its mad appetite for power and its readiness to fight for it\r\nmadly!\r\n\r\n\"As a self-taught mechanic, in his search for perpetual motion, meets\r\never new obstacles and piles mechanism over mechanism to overcome them,\r\nso the bourgeoisie has changed and reconstructed the apparatus of its\r\nsupremacy avoiding 'supra-legal' conflicts with hostile powers. And as\r\nthe self-taught mechanic finally clashes against the ultimate\r\ninsurmountable obstacle,--the law of conservation of energy,--so the\r\nbourgeoisie had to clash against the ultimate implacable barrier,--class\r\nantagonism, fraught with inevitable conflict.\r\n\r\n\"Capitalism, forcing its economic system and social relations on each\r\nand every country, has turned the entire world into one economic and\r\npolitical organism. As the effect of the modern credit system, with the\r\ninvisible bonds it draws between thousands of enterprises, with the\r\namazing mobility it lends to capital, has been to eliminate local and\r\npartial crises, but to give unusual momentum to general economic\r\nconvulsions, so the entire economic and political work of capitalism,\r\nwith its world commerce, with its system of monstrous foreign debts,\r\nwith its political groupings of states, which have drawn all reactionary\r\nforces into one world-wide co-partnership, has prevented local political\r\ncrises, but it has prepared a basis for a social crisis of unheard of\r\nmagnitude. Driving unhealthy processes inside, evading difficulties,\r\nstaving off the deep problems of national and international politics,\r\nglossing over all contradictions, the bourgeoisie has postponed the\r\nclimax, yet it has prepared a radical world-wide liquidation of its\r\npower. It has clung to all reactionary forces no matter what their\r\norigin. It has made the Sultan not the last of its friends. It has not\r\ntied itself on the Chinese ruler only because he had no power: it was\r\nmore profitable to rob his possessions than to keep him in the office\r\nof a world gendarme and to pay him from the treasury of the bourgeoisie.\r\nThus the bourgeoisie made the stability of its political system wholly\r\ndependent upon the stability of the pre-capitalistic pillars of\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n\"This gives events an international character and opens a magnificent\r\nperspective; political emancipation, headed by the working class of\r\nRussia, will elevate its leader to a height unparalleled in history, it\r\nwill give Russian proletariat colossal power and make it the initiator\r\nof world-wide liquidation of capitalism, to which the objective\r\nprerequisites have been created by history.\"\r\n\r\nIt is futile to guess how the Russian revolution will find its way to\r\nold capitalistic Europe. This way may be a total surprise. To illustrate\r\nour thought rather than to predict events, we shall mention Poland as\r\nthe possible connecting link between the revolutionary East and the\r\nrevolutionary West.\r\n\r\n    [The author pictures the consequences of a revolution in Poland. A\r\n    revolution in Poland would necessarily follow the victory of the\r\n    revolution in Russia. This, however, would throw revolutionary\r\n    sparks into the Polish provinces of Germany and Austria. A\r\n    revolution in Posen and Galicia would move the Hohenzollerns and\r\n    Hapsburgs to invade Poland. This would be a sign for the proletariat\r\n    of Germany to get into a sharp conflict with their governments. A\r\n    revolution becomes inevitable.]\r\n\r\nA revolutionary Poland, however, is not the only possible starting point\r\nfor a European revolution. The system of armed peace which became\r\npredominant in Europe after the Franco-Prussian war, was based on a\r\nsystem of European equilibrium. This equilibrium took for granted not\r\nonly the integrity of Turkey, the dismemberment of Poland, the\r\npreservation of Austria, that ethnographic harlequin's robe, but also\r\nthe existence of Russian despotism in the role of a gendarme of the\r\nEuropean reaction, armed to his teeth. The Russo-Japanese war has given\r\na mortal blow to this artificial system in which absolutism was the\r\ndominant figure. For an indefinite period Russia is out of the race as a\r\nfirst-class power. The equilibrium has been destroyed. On the other\r\nhand, the successes of Japan have incensed the conquest instincts of the\r\ncapitalistic bourgeoisie, especially the Stock Exchange, which plays a\r\ncolossal role in modern politics. _The possibilities of a war on\r\nEuropean territory have grown enormously._ Conflicts are ripening here\r\nand there; so far they have been settled in a diplomatic way, but\r\nnothing can guarantee the near future. _A European war, however, means a\r\nEuropean revolution._\r\n\r\nEven without the pressure of such events as war or bankruptcy, a\r\nrevolution may take place in the near future in one of the European\r\ncountries as a result of acute class struggles. We shall not make\r\ncomputations as to which country would be first to take the path of\r\nrevolution; it is obvious, however, that class antagonisms have for the\r\nlast years reached a high degree of intensity in all the European\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Russian revolution on the proletariat of Europe is\r\nimmense. Not only does it destroy the Petersburg absolutism, that main\r\npower of European reaction; it also imbues the minds and the souls of\r\nthe European proletariat with revolutionary daring.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of every Socialist party to revolutionize the minds of\r\nthe working class in the same way as development of capitalism has\r\nrevolutionized social relations. The work of propaganda and organization\r\namong the proletariat, however, has its own intrinsic inertia. The\r\nSocialist parties of Europe--in the first place the most powerful of\r\nthem, the German Socialist party--have developed a conservatism of their\r\nown, which grows in proportion as Socialism embraces ever larger masses\r\nand organization and discipline increase. Social-Democracy, personifying\r\nthe political experience of the proletariat, can, therefore, at a\r\ncertain juncture, become an immediate obstacle on the way of an open\r\nproletarian conflict with the bourgeois reaction. In other words, the\r\npropaganda-conservatism of a proletarian party can, at a certain moment,\r\nimpede the direct struggle of the proletariat for power. The colossal\r\ninfluence of the Russian revolution manifests itself in killing party\r\nroutine, in destroying Socialist conservatism, in making a clean contest\r\nof proletarian forces against capitalist reaction a question of the day.\r\nThe struggle for universal suffrage in Austria, Saxony and Prussia has\r\nbecome more determined under the direct influence of the October strike\r\nin Russia. An Eastern revolution imbues the Western proletariat with\r\nrevolutionary idealism and stimulates its desire to speak \"Russian\" to\r\nits foes.\r\n\r\nThe Russian proletariat in power, even if this were only the result of a\r\npassing combination of forces in the Russian bourgeois revolution,\r\nwould meet organized opposition on the part of the world's reaction, and\r\nreadiness for organized support on the part of the world's proletariat.\r\nLeft to its own resources, the Russian working class must necessarily be\r\ncrushed the moment it loses the aid of the peasants. Nothing remains for\r\nit but to link the fate of its political supremacy and the fate of the\r\nRussian revolution with the fate of a Socialist revolution in Europe.\r\nAll that momentous authority and political power which is given to the\r\nproletariat by a combination of forces in the Russian bourgeois\r\nrevolution, it will thrust on the scale of class struggle in the entire\r\ncapitalistic world. Equipped with governmental power, having a\r\ncounter-revolution behind his back, having the European reaction in\r\nfront of him, the Russian workingman will issue to all his brothers the\r\nworld over his old battle-cry which will now become the call for the\r\nlast attack: _Proletarians of all the world, unite!_\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATORY NOTES\r\n\r\n     The first _Council of Workmen's Deputies_ was formed in Petersburg,\r\n     on October 13th, 1905, in the course of the great general October\r\n     strike that compelled Nicholas Romanoff to promise a Constitution.\r\n     It represented individual factories, labor unions, and included\r\n     also delegates from the Socialist parties. It looked upon itself as\r\n     the center of the revolution and a nucleus of a revolutionary labor\r\n     government. Similar Councils sprung up in many other industrial\r\n     centers. It was arrested on December 3d, having existed for fifty\r\n     days. Its members were tried and sent to Siberia.\r\n\r\n     _Intelligentzia_ is a term applied in Russia to an indefinite,\r\n     heterogeneous group of \"intellectuals,\" who are not actively and\r\n     directly involved in the industrial machinery of capitalism, and at\r\n     the same time are not members of the working class. It is customary\r\n     to count among the _Intelligentzia_ students, teachers, writers,\r\n     lawyers, physicians, college professors, etc. However, the term\r\n     _Intelligentzia_ implies also a certain degree of idealism and\r\n     radical aspirations.\r\n\r\n     _Witte_ was the first prime-minister under the quasi-constitution\r\n     granted on October 17th, 1905. _Stolypin_ was appointed prime\r\n     minister after the dissolution of the first Duma in July, 1906.\r\n\r\n     Under the _minimum program_ the Social-Democrats understand all\r\n     that range of reforms which can be obtained under the existing\r\n     capitalist system of \"private ownership of the means of\r\n     production,\" such as an eight hour workday, social insurance,\r\n     universal suffrage, a republican order. The _maximum program_\r\n     demands the abolition of private property and public management of\r\n     industries, i.e., Socialism.\r\n\r\n     \"_Some prejudices among the masses_\" referred to in this essay is\r\n     the alleged love of the primitive masses for their Tzar. This was\r\n     an argument usually put forth by the liberals against republican\r\n     aspirations.\r\n\r\n     _Lower-Middle-Class_ is the only term half-way covering the Russian\r\n     \"Mieshchanstvo\" used by Trotzky. \"Mieshchanstvo\" has a\r\n     socio-economic meaning, and a flavor of moral disapproval. Socially\r\n     and economically it means those numerous inhabitants of modern\r\n     cities who are engaged in independent economic pursuits, as\r\n     artisans (masters), shopkeepers, small manufacturers, petty\r\n     merchants, etc., who have not capital enough to rank with the\r\n     bourgeoisie. Morally \"Mieshchanstvo\" presupposes a limited horizon,\r\n     lack of definite revolutionary or political ideas, and lack of\r\n     political courage.\r\n\r\n     The _Village community_ is a remnant of old times in Russia. Up to\r\n     1906 the members of the village were not allowed to divide the land\r\n     of the community among the individual peasants on the basis of\r\n     private property. The land legally belonged to the entire community\r\n     which allotted it to its members. Since 1906 the compulsory\r\n     character of communal land-ownership was abandoned, yet in very\r\n     great areas of Russia it still remained the prevailing system of\r\n     land-ownership.\r\n\r\n     Besides having a share in the community-land, the individual\r\n     peasant could acquire a piece of land out of his private means (the\r\n     seller being usually the landlord) and thus become a _small private\r\n     owner_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOVIET AND THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n(Fifty Days)\r\n\r\n     About two years after the arrest of the Soviet of 1905, a number of\r\n     former leaders of that organization, among them Chrustalyov Nossar,\r\n     the first chairman, and Trotzky, the second chairman, met abroad\r\n     after having escaped from Siberian exile. They decided to sum up\r\n     their Soviet experiences in a book which they called _The History\r\n     of the Council of Workingmen's Deputies_. The book appeared in 1908\r\n     in Petersburg, and was immediately suppressed. One of the essays of\r\n     this book is here reprinted.\r\n\r\n     In his estimation of the role of the Soviet Trotzky undoubtedly\r\n     exaggerates. Only by a flight of imagination can one see in the\r\n     activities of the Soviet regarding the postal, telegraph and\r\n     railroad strikers the beginnings of a Soviet control over\r\n     post-office, telegraph and railroads. It is also a serious question\r\n     whether the Soviet was really a leading body, or whether it was led\r\n     by the current of revolutionary events which it was unable to\r\n     control. What makes this essay interesting and significant is\r\n     Trotzky's assertion that \"the first new wave of the revolution will\r\n     lead to the creation of Soviets all over the country.\" This has\r\n     actually happened. His predictions of the formation of an\r\n     all-Russian Soviet, and of the program the Soviets would follow,\r\n     have also been realized in the course of the present revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe history of the Soviet is a history of fifty days. The Soviet was\r\nconstituted on October 13th; its session was interrupted by a military\r\ndetachment of the government on December 3rd. Between those two dates\r\nthe Soviet lived and struggled.\r\n\r\nWhat was the substance of this institution? What enabled it in this\r\nshort period to take an honorable place in the history of the Russian\r\nproletariat, in the history of the Russian Revolution?\r\n\r\nThe Soviet organized the masses, conducted political strikes, led\r\npolitical demonstrations, tried to arm the workingmen. But other\r\nrevolutionary organizations did the same things. The substance of the\r\nSoviet was its effort to become _an organ of public authority_. The\r\nproletariat on one hand, the reactionary press on the other, have called\r\nthe Soviet \"a labor government\"; this only reflects the fact that the\r\nSoviet was in reality _an embryo of a revolutionary government_. In so\r\nfar as the Soviet was in actual possession of authoritative power, it\r\nmade use of it; in so far as the power was in the hands of the military\r\nand bureaucratic monarchy, the Soviet fought to obtain it. Prior to the\r\nSoviet, there had been revolutionary organizations among the industrial\r\nworkingmen, mostly of a Social-Democratic nature. But those were\r\norganizations _among_ the proletariat; their immediate aim was to\r\n_influence the masses_. The Soviet is an organization _of_ the\r\nproletariat; its aim is to fight for _revolutionary power_.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the Soviet was _an organized expression of the will of\r\nthe proletariat as a class_. In its fight for power the Soviet applied\r\nsuch methods as were naturally determined by the character of the\r\nproletariat as a class: its part in production; its numerical strength;\r\nits social homogeneity. In its fight for power the Soviet has combined\r\nthe direction of all the social activities of the working class,\r\nincluding decisions as to conflicts between individual representatives\r\nof capital and labor. This combination was by no means an artificial\r\ntactical attempt: it was a natural consequence of the situation of a\r\nclass which, consciously developing and broadening its fight for its\r\nimmediate interests, had been compelled by the logic of events to assume\r\na leading position in the revolutionary struggle for power.\r\n\r\nThe main weapon of the Soviet was a political strike of the masses. The\r\npower of the strike lies in disorganizing the power of the government.\r\nThe greater the \"anarchy\" created by a strike, the nearer its victory.\r\nThis is true only where \"anarchy\" is not being created by anarchic\r\nactions. The class that puts into motion, day in and day out, the\r\nindustrial apparatus and the governmental apparatus; the class that is\r\nable, by a sudden stoppage of work, to paralyze both industry and\r\ngovernment, must be organized enough not to fall the first victim of the\r\nvery \"anarchy\" it has created. The more effective the disorganization of\r\ngovernment caused by a strike, the more the strike organization is\r\ncompelled to assume governmental functions.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Workmen's Delegates introduces a free press. It organizes\r\nstreet patrols to secure the safety of the citizens. It takes over, to a\r\ngreater or less extent, the post office, the telegraph, and the\r\nrailroads. It makes an effort to introduce the eight hour workday.\r\nParalyzing the autocratic government by a strike, it brings its own\r\ndemocratic order into the life of the working city population.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nAfter January 9th the revolution had shown its power over the minds of\r\nthe working masses. On June 14th, through the revolt of the Potyomkin\r\nTavritchesky it had shown that it was able to become a material force.\r\nIn the October strike it had shown that it could disorganize the enemy,\r\nparalyze his will and utterly humiliate him. By organizing Councils of\r\nWorkmen's Deputies all over the country, _it showed that it was able to\r\ncreate authoritative power_. Revolutionary authority can be based only\r\non active revolutionary force. Whatever our view on the further\r\ndevelopment of the Russian revolution, it is a fact that so far no\r\nsocial class besides the proletariat has manifested readiness to uphold\r\na revolutionary authoritative power. The first act of the revolution was\r\nan encounter in the streets of the _proletariat_ with the monarchy; the\r\nfirst serious victory of the revolution was achieved through the\r\n_class-weapon of the proletariat_, the political strike; the first\r\nnucleus of a revolutionary government was _a proletarian\r\nrepresentation_. The Soviet is the first democratic power in modern\r\nRussian history. The Soviet is the organized power of the masses\r\nthemselves over their component parts. This is a true, unadulterated\r\ndemocracy, without a two-chamber system, without a professional\r\nbureaucracy, with the right of the voters to recall their deputy any\r\nmoment and to substitute another for him. Through its members, through\r\ndeputies elected by the workingmen, the Soviet directs all the social\r\nactivities of the proletariat as a whole and of its various parts; it\r\noutlines the steps to be taken by the proletariat, it gives them a\r\nslogan and a banner. This art of directing the activities of the masses\r\non the basis of organized self-government, is here applied for the first\r\ntime on Russian soil. Absolutism ruled the masses, but it did not direct\r\nthem. It put mechanical barriers against the living creative forces of\r\nthe masses, and within those barriers it kept the restless elements of\r\nthe nation in an iron bond of oppression. The only mass absolutism ever\r\ndirected was the army. But that was not directing, it was merely\r\ncommanding. In recent years, even the directing of this atomized and\r\nhypnotized military mass has been slipping out of the hands of\r\nabsolutism. Liberalism never had power enough to command the masses, or\r\ninitiative enough to direct them. Its attitude towards mass-movements,\r\neven if they helped liberalism directly, was the same as towards\r\nawe-inspiring natural phenomena--earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. The\r\nproletariat appeared on the battlefield of the revolution as a\r\nself-reliant aggregate, totally independent from bourgeois liberalism.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet was a _class-organization_, this was the source of its\r\nfighting power. It was crushed in the first period of its existence not\r\nby lack of confidence on the part of the masses in the cities, but by\r\nthe limitations of a purely urban revolution, by the relatively passive\r\nattitude of the village, by the backwardness of the peasant element of\r\nthe army. The Soviet's position among the city population was as strong\r\nas could be.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet was not an official representative of the entire half million\r\nof the working population in the capital; its organization embraced\r\nabout two hundred thousand, chiefly industrial workers; and though its\r\ndirect and indirect political influence was of a much wider range, there\r\nwere thousands and thousands of proletarians (in the building trade,\r\namong domestic servants, day laborers, drivers) who were hardly, if at\r\nall, influenced by the Soviet. There is no doubt, however, that the\r\nSoviet represented the interests of _all_ these proletarian masses.\r\nThere were but few adherents of the Black Hundred in the factories, and\r\ntheir number dwindled hour by hour. The proletarian masses of Petersburg\r\nwere solidly behind the Soviet. Among the numerous intellectuals of\r\nPetersburg the Soviet had more friends than enemies. Thousands of\r\nstudents recognized the political leadership of the Soviet and ardently\r\nsupported it in its decisions. Professional Petersburg was entirely on\r\nthe side of the Soviet. The support by the Soviet of the postal and\r\ntelegraph strike won it the sympathy of the lower governmental\r\nofficials. All the oppressed, all the unfortunate, all honest elements\r\nof the city, all those who were striving towards a better life, were\r\ninstinctively or consciously on the side of the Soviet. The Soviet was\r\nactually or potentially a representative of an overwhelming majority of\r\nthe population. Its enemies in the capital would not have been dangerous\r\nhad they not been protected by absolutism, which based its power on the\r\nmost backward elements of an army recruited from peasants. The weakness\r\nof the Soviet was not its own weakness, it was the weakness of a purely\r\nurban revolution.\r\n\r\nThe fifty day period was the period of the greatest power of the\r\nrevolution. _The Soviet was its organ in the fight for public\r\nauthority._ The class character of the Soviet was determined by the\r\nclass differentiation of the city population and by the political\r\nantagonism between the proletariat and the capitalistic bourgeoisie.\r\nThis antagonism manifested itself even in the historically limited field\r\nof a struggle against absolutism. After the October strike, the\r\ncapitalistic bourgeoisie consciously blocked the progress of the\r\nrevolution, the petty middle class turned out to be a nonentity,\r\nincapable of playing an independent role. The real leader of the urban\r\nrevolution was the proletariat. Its class-organization was the organ of\r\nthe revolution in its struggle for power.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe struggle for power, for public authority--this is the central aim of\r\nthe revolution. The fifty days of the Soviet's life and its bloody\r\nfinale have shown that urban Russia is too narrow a basis for such a\r\nstruggle, and that even within the limits of the urban revolution, a\r\nlocal organization cannot be the central leading body. For a national\r\ntask the proletariat required an organization on a national scale. The\r\nPetersburg Soviet was a local organization, yet the need of a central\r\norganization was so great that it had to assume leadership on a national\r\nscale. It did what it could, still it remained primarily the\r\n_Petersburg_ Council of Workmen's Deputies. The urgency of an\r\nall-Russian labor congress which undoubtedly would have had authority to\r\nform a central leading organ, was emphasized even at the time of the\r\nfirst Soviet. The December collapse made its realization impossible. The\r\nidea remained, an inheritance of the Fifty Days.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a Soviet has become ingrained in the consciousness of the\r\nworkingmen as the first prerequisite to revolutionary action of the\r\nmasses. Experience has shown that a Soviet is not possible or desirable\r\nunder all circumstances. The objective meaning of the Soviet\r\norganization is to create conditions for disorganizing the government,\r\nfor \"anarchy,\" in other words for a revolutionary conflict. The present\r\nlull in the revolutionary movement, the mad triumph of reaction, make\r\nthe existence of an open, elective, authoritative organization of the\r\nmasses impossible. There is no doubt, however, that _the first new wave\r\nof the revolution will lead to the creation of Soviets all over the\r\ncountry_. An All-Russian Soviet, organized by an All-Russian Labor\r\nCongress, will assume leadership of the local elective organizations of\r\nthe proletariat. Names, of course, are of no importance; so are details\r\nof organization; the main thing is: a centralized democratic leadership\r\nin the struggle of the proletariat for a popular government. History\r\ndoes not repeat itself, and the new Soviet will not have again to go\r\nthrough the experience of the Fifty Days. These, however, will furnish\r\nit a complete program of action.\r\n\r\nThis program is perfectly clear.\r\n\r\nTo establish revolutionary cooeperation with the army, the peasantry, and\r\nthe plebeian lower strata of the urban bourgeoisie. To abolish\r\nabsolutism. To destroy the material organization of absolutism by\r\nreconstructing and partly dismissing the army. To break up the entire\r\nbureaucratic apparatus. To introduce an eight hour workday. To arm the\r\npopulation, starting with the proletariat. To turn the Soviets into\r\norgans of revolutionary self-government in the cities. To create\r\nCouncils of Peasants' Delegates (Peasants' Committees) as local organs\r\nof the agrarian revolution. To organize elections to the Constituent\r\nAssembly and to conduct a preelection campaign for a definite program on\r\nthe part of the representatives of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to formulate such a program than to carry it through. If,\r\nhowever, the revolution will ever win, the proletariat cannot choose\r\nanother. The proletariat will unfold revolutionary accomplishment such\r\nas the world has never seen. The history of Fifty Days will be only a\r\npoor page in the great book of the proletariat's struggle and ultimate\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO _MY ROUND TRIP_\r\n\r\n     Trotzky was never personal. The emotional side of life seldom\r\n     appears in his writings. His is the realm of social activities,\r\n     social and political struggles. His writings breathe logic, not\r\n     sentiment, facts, not poetry. The following preface to his _Round\r\n     Trip_ is, perhaps, the only exception. It speaks of the man Trotzky\r\n     and his beliefs. Note his confession of faith: \"History is a\r\n     tremendous mechanism serving our ideals.\" ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Stockholm Convention of the Social-Democratic Party, some curious\r\nstatistical data was circulated, showing the conditions under which the\r\nparty of the proletariat was working:\r\n\r\nThe Convention as a whole, in the person of its 140 members, had spent\r\nin prison one hundred and thirty-eight years and three and a half\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe Convention had been in exile one hundred and forty-eight years and\r\nsix and a half months.\r\n\r\nEscaped from prison: Once, eighteen members of the Convention; twice,\r\nfour members.\r\n\r\nEscaped from exile: Once, twenty-three; twice, five; three times, one\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nThe length of time the Convention as a whole had been active in\r\nSocial-Democratic work, was 942 years. It follows that the time spent in\r\nprison and exile is about one-third of the time a Social-Democrat is\r\nactive. But these figures are too optimistic. \"The Convention has been\r\nactive in Social-Democratic work for 942 years\"--this means merely that\r\nthe activities of those persons had been spread over so many years.\r\nTheir actual period of work must have been much shorter. Possibly all\r\nthese persons had worked, actually and directly, only one-sixth or\r\none-tenth of the above time. Such are conditions of underground\r\nactivity. On the other hand, the time spent in prison and exile is real\r\ntime: the Convention had spent over fifty thousand days and nights\r\nbehind iron bars, and more than that in barbarous corners of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may give, in addition to these figures, some facts about\r\nmyself. The author of these lines was arrested for the first time in\r\nJanuary, 1898, after working for ten months in the workmen's circles of\r\nNikolayev. He spent two and a half years in prison, and escaped from\r\nSiberia after living there two years of his four years' exile. He was\r\narrested the second time on December 3rd, 1905, as a member of the\r\nPetersburg Council of Workmen's Deputies. The Council had existed for\r\nfifty days. The arrested members of the Soviet each spent 400 days in\r\nprison, then they were sent to Obdorsk \"forever.\" ... Each Russian\r\nSocial-Democrat who has worked in his Party for ten years could give\r\nsimilar statistics about himself.\r\n\r\nThe political helter-skelter which exists in Russia since October 17th\r\nand which the Gotha Almanach has characterized with unconscious humor as\r\n\"_A Constitutional Monarchy under an absolute Tzar_,\" has changed\r\nnothing in our situation. This political order cannot reconcile itself\r\nwith us, not even temporarily, as it is organically incapable of\r\nadmitting any free activity of the masses. The simpletons and hypocrites\r\nwho urge us to \"keep within legal limits\" remind one of Marie Antoinette\r\nwho recommended the starving peasants to eat cake! One would think we\r\nsuffer from an organic aversion for cake, a kind of incurable disease!\r\nOne would think our lungs infected with an irresistible desire to\r\nbreathe the atmosphere of the solitary dungeons in the Fortress of Peter\r\nand Paul! One would think we have no other use for those endless hours\r\npulled out of our lives by the jailers.\r\n\r\nWe love our underground just as little as a drowning person loves the\r\nbottom of the sea. Yet, we have as little choice, as, let us say\r\ndirectly, the absolutist order. Being fully aware of this we can afford\r\nto be optimists even at a time when the underground tightens its grip\r\naround our necks with unrelenting grimness. It will not choke us, we\r\nknow it! We shall survive! When the bones of all the great deeds which\r\nare being performed now by the princes of the earth, their servants and\r\nthe servants of their servants will have turned to dust, when nobody\r\nwill know the graves of many present parties with all their\r\nexploits--the Cause we are serving will rule the world, and our Party,\r\nnow choking underground, will dissolve itself into humanity, for the\r\nfirst time its own master.\r\n\r\nHistory is a tremendous mechanism serving our ideals. Its work is slow,\r\nbarbarously slow, implacably cruel, yet the work goes on. We believe in\r\nit. Only at moments, when this voracious monster drinks the living blood\r\nof our hearts to serve it as food, we wish to shout with all our might:\r\n\r\n_What thou dost, do quickly!_\r\n\r\nParis, April 8/21, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LESSONS OF THE GREAT YEAR\r\n\r\n     This essay was published in a New York Russian newspaper on January\r\n     20th, 1917, less than two months before the Second Russian\r\n     Revolution. Trotzky then lived in New York. The essay shows how his\r\n     contempt, even hatred, for the liberal parties in Russia had grown\r\n     since 1905-6.\r\n\r\n\r\n(January 9th, 1905--January 9th, 1917)\r\n\r\nRevolutionary anniversaries are not only days for reminiscence, they are\r\ndays for summing up revolutionary experiences, especially for us\r\nRussians. Our history has not been rich. Our so-called \"national\r\noriginality\" consisted in being poor, ignorant, uncouth. It was the\r\nrevolution of 1905 that first opened before us the great highway of\r\npolitical progress. On January 9th the workingman of Petersburg knocked\r\nat the gate of the Winter Palace. On January 9th the entire Russian\r\npeople knocked at the gate of history.\r\n\r\nThe crowned janitor did not respond to the knock. Nine months later,\r\nhowever, on October 17th, he was compelled to open the heavy gate of\r\nabsolutism. Notwithstanding all the efforts of bureaucracy, a little\r\nslit stayed open--forever.\r\n\r\nThe revolution was defeated. The same old forces and almost the same\r\nfigures now rule Russia that ruled her twelve years ago. Yet the\r\nrevolution has changed Russia beyond recognition. The kingdom of\r\nstagnation, servitude, vodka and humbleness has become a kingdom of\r\nfermentation, criticism, fight. Where once there was a shapeless\r\ndough--the impersonal, formless people, \"Holy Russia,\"--now social\r\nclasses consciously oppose each other, political parties have sprung\r\ninto existence, each with its program and methods of struggle.\r\n\r\nJanuary 9th opens _a new Russian history_. It is a line marked by the\r\nblood of the people. There is no way back from this line to Asiatic\r\nRussia, to the cursed practices of former generations. There is no way\r\nback. There will never be.\r\n\r\nNot the liberal bourgeoisie, not the democratic groups of the lower\r\nbourgeoisie, not the radical intellectuals, not the millions of Russian\r\npeasants, but the _Russian proletariat_ has by its struggle started the\r\nnew era in Russian history. This is basic. On the foundation of this\r\nfact we, Social-Democrats, have built our conceptions and our tactics.\r\n\r\nOn January 9th it was the priest Gapon who happened to be at the head of\r\nthe Petersburg workers,--a fantastic figure, a combination of\r\nadventurer, hysterical enthusiast and impostor. His priest's robe was\r\nthe last link that then connected the workingmen with the past, with\r\n\"Holy Russia.\" Nine months later, in the course of the October strike,\r\nthe greatest political strike history has ever seen, there was at the\r\nhead of the Petersburg workingmen their own elective self-governing\r\norganization--the Council of Workmen's Deputies. It contained many a\r\nworkingman who had been on Gapon's staff,--nine months of revolution had\r\nmade those men grow, as they made grow the entire working class which\r\nthe Soviet represented.\r\n\r\nIn the first period of the revolution, the activities of the proletariat\r\nwere met with sympathy, even with support from liberal society. The\r\nMilukovs hoped the proletariat would punch absolutism and make it more\r\ninclined to compromise with the bourgeoisie. Yet absolutism, for\r\ncenturies the only ruler of the people, was in no haste to share its\r\npower with the liberal parties. In October, 1905, the bourgeoisie\r\nlearned that it could not obtain power before the back-bone of Tzarism\r\nwas broken. This blessed thing could, evidently, be accomplished only by\r\na victorious revolution. But the revolution put the working class in the\r\nforeground, it united it and solidified it not only in its struggle\r\nagainst Tzarism, but also in its struggle against capital. The result\r\nwas that each new revolutionary step of the proletariat in October,\r\nNovember and December, the time of the Soviet, moved the liberals more\r\nand more in the direction of the monarchy. The hopes for revolutionary\r\ncooeperation between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat turned out a\r\nhopeless Utopia. Those who had not seen it then and had not understood\r\nit later, those who still dream of a \"national\" uprising against\r\nTzarism, do not understand the revolution. For them class struggle is a\r\nsealed book.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1905 the question became acute. The monarchy had learned\r\nby experience that the bourgeoisie would not support the proletariat in\r\na decisive battle. The monarchy then decided to move against the\r\nproletariat with all its forces. The bloody days of December followed.\r\nThe Council of Workmen's Deputies was arrested by the Ismailovski\r\nregiment which remained loyal to Tzarism. The answer of the proletariat\r\nwas momentous: the strike in Petersburg, the insurrection in Moscow, the\r\nstorm of revolutionary movements in all industrial centers, the\r\ninsurrection on the Caucasus and in the Lettish provinces.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary movement was crushed. Many a poor \"Socialist\" readily\r\nconcluded from our December defeats that a revolution in Russia was\r\nimpossible without the support of the bourgeoisie. If this be true, it\r\nwould only mean that a revolution in Russia is impossible.\r\n\r\nOur _upper industrial bourgeoisie_, the only class possessing actual\r\npower, is separated from the proletariat by an insurmountable barrier of\r\nclass hatred, and it needs the monarchy as a pillar of order. The\r\nGutchkovs, Krestovnikovs and Ryabushinskys cannot fail to see in the\r\nproletariat their mortal foe.\r\n\r\nOur _middle and lower industrial and commercial bourgeoisie_ occupies a\r\nvery insignificant place in the economic life of the country, and is all\r\nentangled in the net of capital. The Milukovs, the leaders of the lower\r\nmiddle class, are successful only in so far as they represent the\r\ninterests of the upper bourgeoisie. This is why the Cadet leader called\r\nthe revolutionary banner a \"red rag\"; this is why he declared, after the\r\nbeginning of the war, that if a revolution were necessary to secure\r\nvictory over Germany, he would prefer no victory at all.\r\n\r\nOur _peasantry_ occupies a tremendous place in Russian life. In 1905 it\r\nwas shaken to its deepest foundations. The peasants were driving out\r\ntheir masters, setting estates on fire, seizing the land from the\r\nlandlords. Yes, the curse of the peasantry is that it is scattered,\r\ndisjointed, backward. Moreover, the interests of the various peasant\r\ngroups do not coincide. The peasants arose and fought adroitly against\r\ntheir local slave-holders, yet they stopped in reverence before the\r\nall-Russian slave-holder. The sons of the peasants in the army did not\r\nunderstand that the workingmen were shedding their blood not only for\r\ntheir own sake, but also for the sake of the peasants. The army was an\r\nobedient tool in the hands of Tzarism. It crushed the labor revolution\r\nin December, 1905.\r\n\r\nWhoever thinks about the experiences of 1905, whoever draws a line from\r\nthat year to the present time, must see how utterly lifeless and pitiful\r\nare the hopes of our Social-Patriots for revolutionary cooeperation\r\nbetween the proletariat and the liberal bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twelve years big capital has made great conquests in\r\nRussia. The middle and lower bourgeoisie has become still more dependent\r\nupon the banks and trusts. The working class, which had grown in numbers\r\nsince 1905, is now separated from the bourgeoisie by a deeper abyss than\r\nbefore. If a \"national\" revolution was a failure twelve years ago,\r\nthere is still less hope for it at present.\r\n\r\nIt is true in the last years that the cultural and political level of\r\nthe peasantry has become higher. However, there is less hope now for a\r\nrevolutionary uprising of the peasantry as a whole than there was twelve\r\nyears ago. The only ally of the urban proletariat may be the proletarian\r\nand half-proletarian strata of the village.\r\n\r\nBut, a skeptic may ask, is there then any hope for a victorious\r\nrevolution in Russia under these circumstances?\r\n\r\nOne thing is clear--if a revolution comes, it will not be a result of\r\ncooeperation between capital and labor. The experiences of 1905 show that\r\nthis is a miserable Utopia. To acquaint himself with those experiences,\r\nto study them is the duty of every thinking workingman who is anxious to\r\navoid tragic mistakes. It is in this sense that we have said that\r\nrevolutionary anniversaries are not only days for reminiscences, but\r\nalso days for summing up revolutionary experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Gutchkov_, _Ryabushinsky_ and _Krestovnikov_ are representatives\r\n     of big capital in Russia. Gutchkov is the leader of the moderately\r\n     liberal party of Octobrists. He was War Minister in the first\r\n     Cabinet after the overthrow of the Romanoffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE EVE OF A REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n     This essay was written on March 13th, 1917, when the first news of\r\n     unrest in Petrograd had reached New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe streets of Petrograd again speak the language of 1905. As in the\r\ntime of the Russo-Japanese war, the masses demand bread, peace, and\r\nfreedom. As in 1905, street cars are not running and newspapers do not\r\nappear. The workingmen let the steam out of the boilers, they quit their\r\nbenches and walk out into the streets. The government mobilizes its\r\nCossacks. And as was in 1905, only those two powers are facing each\r\nother in the streets--the revolutionary workingmen and the army of the\r\nTzar.\r\n\r\nThe movement was provoked by lack of bread. This, of course, is not an\r\naccidental cause. In all the belligerent countries the lack of bread is\r\nthe most immediate, the most acute reason for dissatisfaction and\r\nindignation among the masses. All the insanity of the war is revealed to\r\nthem from this angle: it is impossible to produce necessities of life\r\nbecause one has to produce instruments of death.\r\n\r\nHowever, the attempts of the Anglo-Russian semi-official news agencies\r\nto explain the movement by a temporary shortage in food, or to snow\r\nstorms that have delayed transportation, are one of the most ludicrous\r\napplications of the policy of the ostrich. The workingmen would not stop\r\nthe factories, the street cars, the print shops and walk into the\r\nstreets to meet Tzarism face to face on account of snow storms which\r\ntemporarily hamper the arrival of foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nPeople have a short memory. Many of our own ranks have forgotten that\r\nthe war found Russia in a state of potent revolutionary ferment. After\r\nthe heavy stupor of 1908-1911, the proletariat gradually healed its\r\nwounds in the following years of industrial prosperity; the slaughter of\r\nstrikers on the Lena River in April, 1912, awakened the revolutionary\r\nenergy of the proletarian masses. A series of strikes followed. In the\r\nyear preceding the world war, the wave of economic and political strikes\r\nresembled that of 1905. When Poincare, the President of the French\r\nRepublic, came to Petersburg in the summer of 1904 (evidently to talk\r\nover with the Tzar how to free the small and weak nations) the Russian\r\nproletariat was in a stage of extraordinary revolutionary tension, and\r\nthe President of the French Republic could see with his own eyes in the\r\ncapital of his friend, the Tzar, how the first barricades of the Second\r\nRussian Revolution were being constructed.\r\n\r\nThe war checked the rising revolutionary tide. We have witnessed a\r\nrepetition of what happened ten years before, in the Russo-Japanese war.\r\nAfter the stormy strikes of 1903, there had followed a year of almost\r\nunbroken political silence--1904--the first year of the war. It took the\r\nworkingmen of Petersburg twelve months to orientate themselves in the\r\nwar and to walk out into the streets with their demands and protests.\r\nJanuary 9th, 1905, was, so to speak, the official beginning of our First\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThe present war is vaster than was the Russo-Japanese war. Millions of\r\nsoldiers have been mobilized by the government for the \"defense of the\r\nFatherland.\" The ranks of the proletariat have thus been disorganized.\r\nOn the other hand, the more advanced elements of the proletariat had to\r\nface and weigh in their minds a number of questions of unheard of\r\nmagnitude. What is the cause of the war? Shall the proletariat agree\r\nwith the conception of \"the defense of the Fatherland\"? What ought to\r\nbe the tactics of the working-class in war time?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Tzarism and its allies, the upper groups of the\r\nnobility and the bourgeoisie, had during the war completely exposed\r\ntheir true nature,--the nature of criminal plunderers, blinded by\r\nlimitless greed and paralyzed by want of talent. The appetites for\r\nconquest of the governing clique grew in proportion as the people began\r\nto realize its complete inability to cope with the most elementary\r\nproblems of warfare, of industry and supplies in war time.\r\nSimultaneously, the misery of the people grew, deepened, became more and\r\nmore acute,--a natural result of the war multiplied by the criminal\r\nanarchy of the Rasputin Tzarism.\r\n\r\nIn the depths of the great masses, among people who may have never been\r\nreached by a word of propaganda, a profound bitterness accumulated under\r\nthe stress of events. Meantime the foremost ranks of the proletariat\r\nwere finishing digesting the new events. The Socialist proletariat of\r\nRussia came to after the shock of the nationalist fall of the most\r\ninfluential part of the International, and decided that new times call\r\nus not to let up, but to increase our revolutionary struggle.\r\n\r\nThe present events in Petrograd and Moscow are a result of this internal\r\npreparatory work.\r\n\r\nA disorganized, compromised, disjointed government on top. An utterly\r\ndemoralized army. Dissatisfaction, uncertainty and fear among the\r\npropertied classes. At the bottom, among the masses, a deep bitterness.\r\nA proletariat numerically stronger than ever, hardened in the fire of\r\nevents. All this warrants the statement that we are witnessing the\r\nbeginning of the Second Russian Revolution. Let us hope that many of us\r\nwill be its participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO FACES\r\n\r\n\r\n(Internal Forces of the Russian Revolution)\r\n\r\nLet us examine more closely what is going on.\r\n\r\nNicholas has been dethroned, and according to some information, is under\r\narrest. The most conspicuous Black Hundred leaders have been arrested.\r\nSome of the most hated have been killed. A new Ministry has been formed\r\nconsisting of Octobrists, Liberals and the Radical Kerensky. A general\r\namnesty has been proclaimed.\r\n\r\nAll these are facts, big facts. These are the facts that strike the\r\nouter world most. Changes in the higher government give the bourgeoisie\r\nof Europe and America an occasion to say that the revolution has won and\r\nis now completed.\r\n\r\nThe Tzar and his Black Hundred fought for their power, for this alone.\r\nThe war, the imperialistic plans of the Russian bourgeoisie, the\r\ninterests of the Allies, were of minor importance to the Tzar and his\r\nclique. They were ready at any moment to conclude peace with the\r\nHohenzollerns and Hapsburgs, to free their most loyal regiment for war\r\nagainst their own people.\r\n\r\nThe Progressive Bloc of the Duma mistrusted the Tzar and his Ministers.\r\nThis Bloc consisted of various parties of the Russian bourgeoisie. The\r\nBloc had two aims: one, to conduct the war to a victorious end; another,\r\nto secure internal reforms: more order, control, accounting. A victory\r\nis necessary for the Russian bourgeoisie to conquer markets, to increase\r\ntheir territories, to get rich. Reforms are necessary primarily to\r\nenable the Russian bourgeoisie to win the war.\r\n\r\nThe progressive imperialistic Bloc wanted _peaceful_ reforms. The\r\nliberals intended to exert a Duma pressure on the monarchy and to keep\r\nit in check with the aid of the governments of Great Britain and France.\r\nThey did not want a revolution. They knew that a revolution, bringing\r\nthe working masses to the front, would be a menace to their domination,\r\nand primarily a menace to their imperialistic plans. The laboring\r\nmasses, in the cities and in the villages, and even in the army itself,\r\nwant peace. The liberals know it. This is why they have been enemies of\r\nthe revolution all these years. A few months ago Milukov declared in\r\nthe Duma: \"If a revolution were necessary for victory, I would prefer no\r\nvictory at all.\"\r\n\r\nYet the liberals are now in power--through the Revolution. The bourgeois\r\nnewspaper men see nothing but this fact. Milukov, already in his\r\ncapacity as a Minister of Foreign Affairs, has declared that the\r\nrevolution has been conducted in the name of a victory over the enemy,\r\nand that the new government has taken upon itself to continue the war to\r\na victorious end. The New York Stock Exchange interpreted the Revolution\r\nin this specific sense. There are clever people both on the Stock\r\nExchange and among the bourgeois newspaper men. Yet they are all\r\namazingly stupid when they come to deal with mass-movements. They think\r\nthat Milukov manages the revolution, in the same sense as they manage\r\ntheir banks or news offices. They see only the liberal governmental\r\nreflection of the unfolding events, they notice only the foam on the\r\nsurface of the historical torrent.\r\n\r\nThe long pent-up dissatisfaction of the masses has burst forth so late,\r\nin the thirty-second month of the war, not because the masses were held\r\nby police barriers--those barriers had been badly shattered during the\r\nwar--but because all liberal institutions and organs, together with\r\ntheir Social-Patriotic shadows, were exerting an enormous influence over\r\nthe least enlightened elements of the workingmen, urging them to keep\r\norder and discipline in the name of \"patriotism.\" Hungry women were\r\nalready walking out into the streets, and the workingmen were getting\r\nready to uphold them by a general strike, while the liberal bourgeoisie,\r\naccording to news reports, still issued proclamations and delivered\r\nspeeches to check the movement,--resembling that famous heroine of\r\nDickens who tried to stem the tide of the ocean with a broom.\r\n\r\nThe movement, however, took its course, from below, from the\r\nworkingmen's quarters. After hours and days of uncertainty, of shooting,\r\nof skirmishes, the army joined in the revolution, from below, from the\r\nbest of the soldier masses. The old government was powerless, paralyzed,\r\nannihilated. The Tzar fled from the capital \"to the front.\" The Black\r\nHundred bureaucrats crept, like cockroaches, each into his corner.\r\n\r\nThen, and only then, came the Duma's turn to act. The Tzar had attempted\r\nin the last minute to dissolve it. And the Duma would have obeyed,\r\n\"following the example of former years,\" had it been free to adjourn.\r\nThe capitals, however, were already dominated by the revolutionary\r\npeople, the same people that had walked out into the streets despite the\r\nwishes of the liberal bourgeoisie. The army was with the people. Had not\r\nthe bourgeoisie attempted to organize its own government, a\r\nrevolutionary government would have emerged from the revolutionary\r\nworking masses. The Duma of June 3rd would never have dared to seize the\r\npower from the hands of Tzarism. But it did not want to miss the chance\r\noffered by interregnum: the monarchy had disappeared, while a\r\nrevolutionary government was not yet formed. Contrary to all their part,\r\ncontrary to their own policies and against their will, the liberals\r\nfound themselves in possession of power.\r\n\r\nMilukov now declares Russia will continue the war \"to the end.\" It is\r\nnot easy for him so to speak: he knows that his words are apt to arouse\r\nthe indignation of the masses against the new government. Yet he had to\r\nspeak to them--for the sake of the London, Paris and American Stock\r\nExchanges. It is quite possible that he cabled his declaration for\r\nforeign consumption only, and that he concealed it from his own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMilukov knows very well that _under given conditions he cannot continue\r\nthe war, crush Germany, dismember Austria, occupy Constantinople and\r\nPoland_.\r\n\r\nThe masses have revolted, demanding bread and peace. The appearance of a\r\nfew liberals at the head of the government has not fed the hungry, has\r\nnot healed the wounds of the people. To satisfy the most urgent, the\r\nmost acute needs of the people, _peace_ must be restored. The liberal\r\nimperialistic Bloc does not dare to speak of peace. They do not do it,\r\nfirst, on account of the Allies. They do not do it, further, because the\r\nliberal bourgeoisie is to a great extent responsible before the people\r\nfor the present war. The Milukovs and Gutchkovs, not less than the\r\nRomanoff camarilla, have thrown the country into this monstrous\r\nimperialistic adventure. To stop the war, to return to the ante-bellum\r\nmisery would mean that they have to account to the people for this\r\nundertaking. The Milukovs and Gutchkovs are afraid of the liquidation of\r\nthe war not less than they were afraid of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThis is their aspect in their new capacity, as the government of\r\nRussia. They are compelled to continue the war, and they can have no\r\nhope of victory; they are afraid of the people, and people do not trust\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis is how Karl Marx characterized a similar situation:\r\n\r\n\"From the very beginning ready to betray the people and to compromise\r\nwith the crowned representatives of the old regime, because the\r\nbourgeoisie itself belongs to the old world; ... keeping a place at the\r\nsteering wheel of the revolution not because the people were back of\r\nthem, but because the people pushed them forward; ... having no faith in\r\nthemselves, no faith in the people; grumbling against those above,\r\ntrembling before those below; selfish towards both fronts and aware of\r\ntheir selfishness; revolutionary in the face of conservatives, and\r\nconservative in the face of revolutionists, with no confidence in their\r\nown slogans and with phrases instead of ideas; frightened by the world's\r\nstorm and exploiting the world's storm,--vulgar through lack of\r\noriginality, and original only in vulgarity; making profitable business\r\nout of their own desires, with no initiative, with no vocation for\r\nworld-wide historic work ... a cursed senile creature condemned to\r\ndirect and abuse in his own senile interests the first youthful\r\nmovements of a powerful people,--a creature with no eyes, with no ears,\r\nwith no teeth, with nothing whatever,--this is how the Prussian\r\nbourgeoisie stood at the steering wheel of the Prussian state after the\r\nMarch revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThese words of the great master give a perfect picture of the Russian\r\nliberal bourgeoisie, as it stands at the steering wheel of the\r\ngovernment after _our_ March revolution. \"With no faith in themselves,\r\nwith no faith in the people, with no eyes, with no teeth.\" ... This is\r\ntheir political face.\r\n\r\nLuckily for Russia and Europe, there is another face to the Russian\r\nRevolution, a genuine face: the cables have brought the news that the\r\nProvisional Government is opposed by a Workmen's Committee which has\r\nalready raised a voice of protest against the liberal attempt to rob the\r\nRevolution and to deliver the people to the monarchy.\r\n\r\nShould the Russian Revolution stop to-day as the representatives of\r\nliberalism advocate, to-morrow the reaction of the Tzar, the nobility\r\nand the bureaucracy would gather power and drive Milukov and Gutchkov\r\nfrom their insecure ministerial trenches, as did the Prussian reaction\r\nyears ago with the representatives of Prussian liberalism. But the\r\nRussian Revolution will not stop. Time will come, and the Revolution\r\nwill make a clean sweep of the bourgeois liberals blocking its way, as\r\nit is now making a clean sweep of the Tzarism reaction.\r\n\r\n(Published in New York on March 17, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     _June Third_, 1907, was the day on which, after the dissolution of\r\n     the First and Second Dumas, the Tzar's government, in defiance of\r\n     the Constitution, promulgated a new electoral law which eliminated\r\n     from the Russian quasi-Parliament large groups of democratic\r\n     voters, thus securing a \"tame\" majority obedient to the command of\r\n     the government. To say \"The Duma of June Third\" is equivalent to\r\n     saying: \"a Duma dominated by representatives of rich land-owners\r\n     and big business,\" generally working hand in hand with autocracy,\r\n     though pretending to be representatives of the people. In the Duma\r\n     of June Third, the Octobrists and all parties to the right of them\r\n     were with the government, the Constitutional Democrats (Cadets) and\r\n     all parties to the left of them were in the opposition.\r\n\r\n     The _Progressive Bloc_ was formed in the Duma in 1915. It included\r\n     a number of liberal and conservative factions, together with the\r\n     Cadets, and was opposed to the government. Its program was a\r\n     Cabinet responsible to the Duma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROWING CONFLICT\r\n\r\n\r\nAn open conflict between the forces of the Revolution, headed by the\r\ncity proletariat and the anti-revolutionary liberal bourgeoisie\r\ntemporarily at the head of the government, is more and more impending.\r\nIt cannot be avoided. Of course, the liberal bourgeoisie and the\r\nquasi-Socialists of the vulgar type will find a collection of very\r\ntouching slogans as to \"national unity\" against class divisions; yet no\r\none has ever succeeded in removing social contrasts by conjuring with\r\nwords or in checking the natural progress of revolutionary struggle.\r\n\r\nThe internal history of unfolding events is known to us only in\r\nfragments, through casual remarks in the official telegrams. But even\r\nnow it is apparent that on two points the revolutionary proletariat is\r\nbound to oppose the liberal bourgeoisie with ever-growing determination.\r\n\r\nThe first conflict has already arisen around the question of the form of\r\ngovernment. The Russian bourgeoisie needs a monarchy. In all the\r\ncountries pursuing an imperialistic policy, we observe an unusual\r\nincrease of personal power. The policy of world usurpations, secret\r\ntreaties and open treachery requires independence from Parliamentary\r\ncontrol and a guarantee against changes in policies caused by the change\r\nof Cabinets. Moreover, for the propertied classes the monarchy is the\r\nmost secure ally in its struggle against the revolutionary onslaught of\r\nthe proletariat.\r\n\r\nIn Russia both these causes are more effective than elsewhere. The\r\nRussian bourgeoisie finds it impossible to deny the people universal\r\nsuffrage, well aware that this would arouse opposition against the\r\nProvisional Government among the masses, and give prevalence to the\r\nleft, the more determined wing of the proletariat in the Revolution.\r\nEven that monarch of the reserve, Michael Alexandrovitch, understands\r\nthat he cannot reach the throne without having promised \"universal,\r\nequal, direct and secret suffrage.\" It is the more essential for the\r\nbourgeoisie to create right now a monarchic counterbalance against the\r\ndeepest social-revolutionary demands of the working masses. _Formally_,\r\nin words, the bourgeoisie has agreed to leave the question of a form of\r\ngovernment to the discretion of the Constituent Assembly. Practically,\r\nhowever, the Octobrist-Cadet Provisional Government will turn all the\r\npreparatory work for the Constituent Assembly into a campaign in favor\r\nof a monarchy against a Republic. The character of the Constituent\r\nAssembly will largely depend upon the character of those who convoke it.\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that right now the revolutionary proletariat\r\nwill have _to set up its own organs, the Councils of Workingmen's\r\nSoldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, against the executive organs of the\r\nProvisional Government_. In this struggle the proletariat ought to unite\r\nabout itself the rising masses of the people, with one aim in view--_to\r\nseize governmental power_. Only a Revolutionary Labor Government will\r\nhave the desire and ability to give the country a thorough democratic\r\ncleansing during the work preparatory to the Constituent Assembly, to\r\nreconstruct the army from top to bottom, to turn it into _a\r\nrevolutionary militia_ and to show the poorer peasants in practice that\r\ntheir only salvation is in a support of a revolutionary labor regime. A\r\nConstituent Assembly convoked after such preparatory work will truly\r\nreflect the revolutionary, creative forces of the country and become a\r\npowerful factor in the further development of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe second question that is bound to bring the internationally inclined\r\nSocialist proletariat in opposition to the imperialistic liberal\r\nbourgeoisie, is _the question of war and peace_.\r\n\r\n(Published in New York, March 19, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR OR PEACE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of chief interest, now, to the governments and the peoples\r\nof the world is, What will be the influence of the Russian Revolution on\r\nthe War? Will it bring peace nearer? Or will the revolutionary\r\nenthusiasm of the people swing towards a more vigorous prosecution of\r\nthe war?\r\n\r\nThis is a great question. On its solution depends not only the outcome\r\nof the war, but the fate of the Revolution itself.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, Milukov, the present militant Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\ncalled the Russo-Japanese war an adventure and demanded its immediate\r\ncessation. This was also the spirit of the liberal and radical press.\r\nThe strongest industrial organizations favored immediate peace in spite\r\nof unequaled disasters. Why was it so? Because they expected internal\r\nreforms. The establishment of a Constitutional system, a parliamentary\r\ncontrol over the budget and the state finances, a better school system\r\nand, especially, an increase in the land possessions of the peasants,\r\nwould, they hoped, increase the prosperity of the population and create\r\na _vast internal market_ for Russian industry. It is true that even\r\nthen, twelve years ago, the Russian bourgeoisie was ready to usurp land\r\nbelonging to others. It hoped, however, that abolition of feudal\r\nrelations in the village would create a more powerful market than the\r\nannexation of Manchuria or Corea.\r\n\r\nThe democratization of the country and liberation of the peasants,\r\nhowever, turned out to be a slow process. Neither the Tzar, nor the\r\nnobility, nor the bureaucracy were willing to yield any of their\r\nprerogatives. Liberal exhortations were not enough to make them give up\r\nthe machinery of the state and their land possessions. A revolutionary\r\nonslaught of the masses was required. This the bourgeoisie did not want.\r\nThe agrarian revolts of the peasants, the ever growing struggle of the\r\nproletariat and the spread of insurrections in the army caused the\r\nliberal bourgeoisie to fall back into the camp of the Tzarist\r\nbureaucracy and reactionary nobility. Their alliance was sealed by the\r\n_coup d'etat_ of June 3rd, 1907. Out of this _coup d'etat_ emerged the\r\nThird and the Fourth Dumas.\r\n\r\nThe peasants received no land. The administrative system changed only in\r\nname, not in substance. The development of an internal market consisting\r\nof prosperous farmers, after the American fashion, did not take place.\r\nThe capitalist classes, reconciled with the regime of June 3rd, turned\r\ntheir attention to the usurpation of foreign markets. A new era of\r\nRussian imperialism ensues, an imperialism accompanied by a disorderly\r\nfinancial and military system and by insatiable appetites. Gutchkov, the\r\npresent War Minister, was formerly a member of the Committee on National\r\nDefense, helping to make the army and the navy complete. Milukov, the\r\npresent Minister of Foreign Affairs, worked out a program of world\r\nconquests which he advocated on his trips to Europe. Russian imperialism\r\nand his Octobrist and Cadet representatives bear a great part of the\r\nresponsibility for the present war.\r\n\r\nBy the grace of the Revolution which they had not wanted and which they\r\nhad fought, Gutchkov and Milukov are now in power. For the continuation\r\nof the war, for victory? Of course! They are the same persons who had\r\ndragged the country into the war for the sake of the interests of\r\ncapital. All their opposition to Tzarism had its source in their\r\nunsatisfied imperialistic appetites. So long as the clique of Nicholas\r\nII. was in power, the interests of the dynasty and of the reactionary\r\nnobility were prevailing in Russian foreign affairs. This is why Berlin\r\nand Vienna had hoped to conclude a separate peace with Russia. Now,\r\npurely imperialistic interests have superseded the Tzarism interests;\r\npure imperialism is written on the banner of the Provisional Government.\r\n\"The government of the Tzar is gone,\" the Milukovs and Gutchkovs say to\r\nthe people, \"now you must shed your blood for the common interests of\r\nthe entire nation.\" Those interests the imperialists understand as the\r\nreincorporation of Poland, the conquest of Galicia, Constantinople,\r\nArmenia, Persia.\r\n\r\nThis transition from an imperialism of the dynasty and the nobility to\r\nan imperialism of a purely bourgeois character, can never reconcile the\r\nRussian proletariat to the war. An international struggle against the\r\nworld slaughter and imperialism are now our task more than ever. The\r\nlast despatches which tell of an anti-militaristic propaganda in the\r\nstreets of Petrograd show that our comrades are bravely doing their\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n_The imperialistic boasts of Milukov to crush Germany, Austria and\r\nTurkey are the most effective and most timely aid for the Hohenzollerns\r\nand Hapsburgs...._ Milukov will now serve as a scare-crow in their\r\nhands. The liberal imperialistic government of Russia has not yet\r\nstarted reform in its own army, yet it is already helping the\r\nHohenzollerns to raise the patriotic spirit and to mend the shattered\r\n\"national unity\" of the German people. Should the German proletariat be\r\ngiven a right to think that all the Russian people and the main force of\r\nthe Russian Revolution, the proletariat, are behind the bourgeois\r\ngovernment of Russia, it would be a terrific blow to the men of our\r\ntrend of mind, the revolutionary Socialists of Germany. To turn the\r\nRussian proletariat into patriotic cannon food in the service of the\r\nRussian liberal bourgeoisie would mean _to throw the German working\r\nmasses into the camp of the chauvinists and for a long time to halt the\r\nprogress of a revolution in Germany_.\r\n\r\nThe prime duty of the revolutionary proletariat in Russia is to show\r\nthat there is _no power_ behind the evil imperialistic will of the\r\nliberal bourgeoisie. The Russian Revolution has to show the entire world\r\nits real face.\r\n\r\n_The further progress of the revolutionary struggle in Russia and the\r\ncreation of a Revolutionary Labor Government supported by the people\r\nwill be a mortal blow to the Hohenzollerns because it will give a\r\npowerful stimulus to the revolutionary movement of the German\r\nproletariat and of the labor masses of all the other countries._ If the\r\nfirst Russian Revolution of 1905 brought about revolutions in Asia--in\r\nPersia, Turkey, China--the Second Russian Revolution will be the\r\nbeginning of a powerful social-revolutionary struggle in Europe. Only\r\nthis struggle will bring real peace to the blood-drenched world.\r\n\r\nNo, the Russian proletariat will not allow itself to be harnessed to the\r\nchariot of Milukov imperialism. The banner of Russian Social-Democracy\r\nis now, more than ever before, glowing with bright slogans of inflexible\r\nInternationalism:\r\n\r\nAway with imperialistic robbers!\r\n\r\nLong live a Revolutionary Labor Government!\r\n\r\nLong live Peace and the Brotherhood of Nations!\r\n\r\n(Published in New York, March 20, 1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTROTZKY ON THE PLATFORM IN PETROGRAD\r\n\r\n\r\n(From a Russian paper)\r\n\r\nTrotzky, always Trotzky.\r\n\r\nSince I had seen him the last time, he has been advanced in rank: he has\r\nbecome the chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. He has succeeded\r\nTchcheidze, the wise, sober leader who has lost the confidence of the\r\nrevolutionary masses. He holds the place of Lenin, the recognized leader\r\nof the left wing of Social-Democracy, whose absence from the capital is\r\ndue to external, accidental causes.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Trotzky has become more nervous, more gloomy, and\r\nmore restrained. Something like a freezing chill emanates from his deep\r\nand restless eyes; a cool, determined, ironical smile plays around his\r\nmobile Jewish lips, and there is a chill in his well-balanced, clear-cut\r\nwords which he throws into his audience with a peculiar calmness.\r\n\r\nHe seems almost lonesome on the platform. Only a small group of\r\nfollowers applaud. The others protest against his words or cast angry,\r\nrestless glances at him. He is in a hostile gathering. He is a stranger.\r\nIs he not also a stranger to those who applaud him and in whose name he\r\nspeaks from this platform?\r\n\r\nCalm and composed he looks at his adversaries, and you feel it is a\r\npeculiar joy for him to see the rage, the fear, the excitement his words\r\nprovoke. He is a Mephisto who throws words like bombs to create a war of\r\nbrothers at the bedside of their sick mother.\r\n\r\nHe knows in advance which words will have the greatest effect, which\r\nwould provoke the most bitter resentment. And the more extreme, the more\r\npainful his words are, the firmer and stronger is his voice, the slower\r\nhis speech, the more challenging his tone. He speaks a sentence, then he\r\nstops to wait till the storm is over, then he repeats his assertion,\r\nwith sharper intonation and with more disdain in his tone. Only his eyes\r\nbecome more nervous, and a peculiar disquieting fire is blazing in them.\r\n\r\nThis time he does not speak; he reads a written declaration. He reads it\r\nwith pauses, sometimes accentuating the words, sometimes passing over\r\nthem quickly, but all the time he is aware of the effect and waits for a\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nHis voice is the voice of a prophet, a preacher:\r\n\r\n\"Petrograd is in danger! The Revolution is in danger! The people are in\r\ndanger!\" ...\r\n\r\nHe is a stranger on the platform, and yet--electric currents flow from\r\nhim to his surroundings, creating sincere though primitive enthusiasm on\r\none side, on the other anger and spite.
