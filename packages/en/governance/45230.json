GEORGE FRISBIE HOAR, LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speeches of Charles Sumner have many titles to endure in the memory\r\nof mankind. They contain the reasons on which the American people\r\nacted in taking the successive steps in the revolution which overthrew\r\nslavery, and made of a race of slaves, freemen, citizens, voters. They\r\nhave a high place in literature. They are not only full of historical\r\nlearning, set forth in an attractive way, but each of the more\r\nimportant of them was itself an historical event. They afford a picture\r\nof a noble public character. They are an example of the application of\r\nthe loftiest morality to the conduct of the State. They are an arsenal\r\nof weapons ready for the friends of Freedom in all the great battles\r\nwhen she may be in peril hereafter. They will not be forgotten unless\r\nthe world shall attain to such height of virtue that no stimulant\r\nto virtue shall be needed, or to a depth of baseness from which no\r\nstimulant can arouse it.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner held the office of Justice of the Peace, and that of\r\nCommissioner of the Circuit Court, to which he was appointed by his\r\nfriend and teacher, Judge Story. He was a member of the convention\r\nheld in 1853 to revise the Constitution of the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts. With these exceptions, his only official service was as\r\nSenator in Congress from Massachusetts, from the 4th of March, 1851,\r\nwhen he was just past forty years of age, until his death, March 9,\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nIf his career could have been predicted in his earliest childhood, he\r\ncould have had no better training for his great duties than that he\r\nin fact received. He was one of the best scholars in the public Latin\r\nSchool in Boston. He received the Franklin medal from the hands of\r\nDaniel Webster, who told him that \"the state had a pledge of him.\"\r\nHis school life was followed by four years in Harvard College, and a\r\ncourse at the Harvard Law School, where he was the favorite pupil of\r\nJudge Story. He was an eager student of the Greek and Roman classics.\r\nBut his special delight was in history and international law. After his\r\nadmission to the bar he was reporter of the decisions of his beloved\r\nmaster, and edited twenty volumes of the equity reports of Vesey, Jr.,\r\nwhich he enriched with copious and learned notes. A little later, when\r\nhe was twenty-six years old, he spent a month in Washington, tarrying\r\na short time in New York on his way. In that brief period he made\r\nlife-long friendships with some famous men, including Chancellor Kent,\r\nJudge Marshall, and Francis Lieber. He had a rare gift for making\r\nfriendships with men, especially with great men, and with women. With\r\nhim in those days an acquaintance with any person worth knowing soon\r\nripened into an indissoluble friendship.\r\n\r\nA few years later he spent a little more than two years in Europe,\r\ncoming home when he was just past twenty-nine years old. That time\r\nwas spent in attending courts, lectures of eminent professors, and\r\nin society. No house which he desired to enter seems to have been\r\nclosed to him. Statesmen, judges, scholars, beautiful women, leaders\r\nof fashionable society, welcomed to the closest intimacy this young\r\nAmerican of humble birth, with no passport other than his own\r\ncharacter and attainment. It is hardly too much to say that the youth\r\nof twenty-nine had a larger and more brilliant circle of friendship\r\nthan any other man on either continent. The list of his friends and\r\ncorrespondents would fill many pages. He says in a letter to Judge\r\nStory, what would seem like boasting in other men, but with him was\r\nmodest and far within the truth:--\r\n\r\n\"I have a thousand things to say to you about the law, circuit life,\r\nand the English judges. I have seen more of all than probably ever fell\r\nto the lot of a foreigner. I have had the friendship and confidence\r\nof judges, and of the leaders of the bar. Not a day passes without\r\nmy being five or six hours in company with men of this stamp. My\r\ntour is no vulgar holiday affair, merely to spend money and to get\r\nthe fashions. It is to see men, institutions, and laws; and, if it\r\nwould not seem vain in me, I would venture to say that I have not\r\ndiscredited my country. I have called the attention of the judges and\r\nthe profession to the state of the law in our country, and have shown\r\nthem, by my conversation (I will say this), that I understand their\r\njurisprudence.\"\r\n\r\nHe returned from Europe bringing his sheaves with him. He resolved to\r\ndevote himself to the study and practice of jurisprudence, to avoid\r\npolitical strife and political office, hoping that he might, perhaps,\r\nat some future time, succeed to the chair of Judge Story at Harvard.\r\nHe kept up his habit of incessant labor. He contributed to the reviews\r\nand newspapers a few essays on literature and jurisprudence, and some\r\nobituary notices of deceased friends. He became interested in prison\r\ndiscipline and in the cause of peace. In January, 1846, he engaged in\r\nan earnest debate in the Prison Discipline Society, in which he favored\r\nthe system of separate imprisonment for criminals, and maintained\r\nhis side with great power. July 4, 1845, he delivered in Boston the\r\noration printed in these volumes entitled, \"The True Grandeur of\r\nNations,\" which was declared by Richard Cobden to be the most powerful\r\ncontribution to the cause of peace made by any modern writer. August\r\n27, 1846, he delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa Society, at Harvard,\r\nhis oration entitled, \"The Scholar, The Jurist, The Artist, The\r\nPhilanthropist,\" in which, in the form of eulogies of his four friends,\r\nPickering, Story, Allston, and Channing, he set forth with masterly\r\neloquence the beauties of the virtues of which they were shining\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nBut he could not remain an indifferent spectator of the great contest\r\nthen going on between freedom and slavery for the possession of the\r\nvast territory between the Mississippi and the Pacific. His first\r\npublic speech against slavery, printed in these volumes, was delivered\r\nNovember 4, 1845. June 28, 1848, he was present at the meeting in\r\nWorcester, where the Free Soil party, afterward the Republican party,\r\nwas founded, and from that time was recognized in Massachusetts, and\r\nvery largely throughout the country, as the most eloquent leader and\r\nchampion of the political movement against slavery. He was elected to\r\nthe seat of Daniel Webster, in the Senate of the United States, April\r\n24, 1851, and took the oath of office December 1, 1851. The history of\r\nhis career from that time to his death, the history of the great party\r\nhe helped to found, the history of liberty in the United States, are\r\nalmost identical.\r\n\r\n  \"The record of the cause he loved\r\n  Is the best record of its friend.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Charles Sumner to keep aloof from the great\r\ncontest for which he was the best equipped champion alive, or to\r\ndecline to obey the voice of the beloved commonwealth commanding him\r\nto take his place in the front and heat of the battle. He had every\r\nquality of soul and intellect, every accomplishment, every equipment,\r\nneeded to fit him for that lofty leadership. Emerson said of him that\r\nhe had the whitest soul he ever knew. In such warfare no armor of proof\r\nis like the defence of absolute integrity, no temper of the sword is\r\nlike that of perfect purity.\r\n\r\n  \"My good sword cleaves the casques of men,\r\n  My tough lance thrusteth sure,\r\n  My strength is as the strength of ten,\r\n  Because my heart is pure.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a man of absolute singleness of purpose and directness of aim. He\r\nwent straight to his mark. His public life was devoted to one object,\r\nwhich absorbed his whole soul; that was to make righteousness and\r\nfreedom controlling forces in the government of the country. He had no\r\nother ambition. He desired public office only as he could make it an\r\ninstrument to that end. He cared for history only as its lessons were\r\nlessons of justice and freedom. He cared for literature only as he\r\ncould draw from it persuasion, argument, or illustration which would\r\nadvance that lofty purpose. He cared for art only when it taught a\r\nmoral lesson.\r\n\r\nHe had a marvellous capacity for work. From the beginning to the end,\r\nhis life was a life of incessant labor. He had no idle moments. Even\r\nconversation, in which he delighted, was an intellectual exercise. In\r\ncollege, the lonely light shone out from his study window, where he\r\n\r\n  \"outwatched the Bear\"\r\n\r\nlong after the gayest of youthful revellers had gone to bed. Even in\r\nthe heat of summer, in Washington, his life was crowded with hard\r\nwork. I have known him more than once to fix the hour of midnight for\r\na meeting with delegations with whom he could find no time in the busy\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe results of this incessant toil were retained in a memory from which\r\nnothing seemed to escape. As it was impossible for him to be idle, so\r\nit seemed impossible for him to forget. His mind was an encyclopædia\r\nof the literature and history of constitutional liberty.\r\n\r\nHe had an indomitable courage. He never flinched or hesitated. He was\r\nnever troubled with doubts. He saw everything clearly, and could never\r\nunderstand the state of mind of a man who could not see things as he\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nHis was the most hopeful nature it was ever my fortune to know. The\r\ngreat virtue of hope, the central figure in the mighty group which\r\nthe apostle tells us are forever to abide, possessed the very depths\r\nof his soul. He came into public life when slavery controlled every\r\ndepartment of the government; legislated through Congress; administered\r\nthe law through the Executive; sat on the bench of the Supreme Court.\r\nThe first years of his public service were years of signal victories of\r\nthe slaveholding power. To common men the day seemed constantly growing\r\ndarker and darker, and the cause of freedom more and more hopeless.\r\nSumner never abated one jot or tittle of his sublime confidence. The\r\nclose of some of his speeches in those days is a trumpet note of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nWhen he was stricken down in the Senate-chamber by the bludgeon of an\r\nassassin, his first conscious utterance as he recovered from the stupor\r\ncaused by the terrible blows upon his head was that he would renew the\r\nconflict with slavery in the Senate as soon as he could return there.\r\nIn his first public speech, a few weeks afterward, he said: \"You have\r\nalready made allusion to the suffering which I have undergone. This is\r\nnot small, but it has been incurred in the performance of duty; and\r\nhow small is it compared with that tale of woe which is perpetually\r\ncoming to us from the house of bondage! With you I hail the omens of\r\nfinal triumph. I ask no prophet to confirm this assurance. The future\r\nis not less secure than the past.\"\r\n\r\nHe prefixed to his own edition of his works the motto from Leibnitz:--\r\n\r\n  \"Veniet fortasse aliud tempus, dignius nostro,\r\n  Quo, debellatis odiis, veritas triumphabit.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no \"fortasse\" about it, to his confident and triumphant\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nHe had a gentle, affectionate, and magnanimous nature, incapable of\r\nhatred or revenge. In spite of his severity of speech, his differences\r\nwith men were differences of principle, never personal. There is no\r\nnobler sentence in political history than that with which he begins his\r\nfirst speech after his injury, when he got back from Europe and took\r\nhis place again in the Senate:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President: Undertaking now, after a silence of more than\r\n    four years, to address the Senate on this important subject, I\r\n    should suppress the emotions natural to such an occasion, if I did\r\n    not declare on the threshold my gratitude to that Supreme Being\r\n    through whose benign care I am enabled, after much suffering and\r\n    many changes, once again to resume my duties here, and to speak\r\n    for the cause so near my heart. To the honored commonwealth whose\r\n    representative I am, and also to my immediate associates in this\r\n    body, with whom I enjoy the fellowship which is found _in thinking\r\n    alike concerning the Republic_, I owe thanks, which I seize the\r\n    moment to express, for indulgence extended to me throughout the\r\n    protracted seclusion enjoined on me by medical skill; and I trust\r\n    it will not be thought unbecoming in me to put on record here, as\r\n    an apology for leaving my seat so long vacant, without making way,\r\n    by resignation, for a successor, that I acted under the illusion of\r\n    an invalid, whose hopes for restoration to natural health continued\r\n    against oft recurring disappointment.\r\n\r\n    \"When last I entered into this debate, it became my duty to\r\n    expose the crime against Kansas, and to insist upon the immediate\r\n    admission of that territory as a state of this Union, with a\r\n    constitution forbidding slavery. Time has passed, but the question\r\n    remains. Resuming the discussion precisely where I left it, I\r\n    am happy to avow that rule of moderation which, it is said, may\r\n    venture to fix the boundaries of wisdom itself. I have no personal\r\n    griefs to utter; only a vulgar egotism could intrude such into this\r\n    chamber. I have no personal wrongs to avenge; only a brutish nature\r\n    could attempt to wield that vengeance which belongs to the Lord.\r\n    The years that have intervened and the tombs that have opened since\r\n    I spoke[1] have their voices, too, which I cannot fail to hear.\r\n    Besides, what am I, what is any man among the living or among the\r\n    dead, compared with the question before us? It is this alone which\r\n    I shall discuss, and I begin the argument with that easy victory\r\n    which is found in charity.\"\r\n\r\n    [1] Preston S. Brooks and Senator Butler had both died in the\r\n    interval.\r\n\r\nHe was proud that he was an American, proud of his State, proud of his\r\nbirthplace, proud of his office. To his mind the most exalted position\r\non earth was the position of a Senator of the United States. And if he\r\nthought that to be a Massachusetts Senator was a prouder title still,\r\nwho shall blame him? From the beginning he had Massachusetts behind\r\nhim; when he spoke from his seat, it was the voice, not of a man, but\r\nof a commonwealth.\r\n\r\nIt seemed sometimes as if he thought everything that had been\r\naccomplished for freedom was accomplished in the Senate; that even the\r\nwar was but a tumult which had disturbed the debates, somewhat. He kept\r\nhis senatorial robe unstained. He seemed never to lay it aside. There\r\nwas no place in his life for jesting or trifling. He had no sense of\r\nhumor. The pledge which he took upon his lips when he entered upon his\r\ngreat office he kept religiously to the end. \"To vindicate freedom\r\nand oppose slavery is the object near my heart. Others may become\r\nindifferent to these principles, bartering them for political success,\r\nvain and short-lived, or forgetting the visions of youth in the dreams\r\nof age. Whenever I forget them, whenever I become indifferent to them,\r\nwhenever I cease to be constant in maintaining them through good report\r\nand evil report, then may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, may\r\nmy right hand forget its cunning.\"\r\n\r\nHis political creed, his political Bible, his Ten Commandments, his\r\nGolden Rule, were the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution\r\nof the United States penetrated, illuminated, interpreted by the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. There was not a syllable in that august\r\ndocument to be omitted or qualified. It was to him a permanent,\r\nperfect, universal law of national life.\r\n\r\nOn many of the great questions with which the American people had to\r\ndeal for the last thirty years of his life,--from 1844 to 1874--he\r\nwas the leader and guide. His speeches on these subjects, contained\r\nin these volumes, were the speeches which attracted widest public\r\nattention at the time. They contained the arguments which convinced the\r\npublic mind. They are probably, in most cases, the only ones remembered\r\nnow. Toward the close of his life he gave much study to the questions\r\nof finance and currency. If his life had been spared he doubtless would\r\nhave been foremost in conducting the country in the path of financial\r\nsafety and integrity. The titles of the following speeches, to which\r\nmany others might be added, suggest the principal subjects with which\r\nhe dealt.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The True Grandeur of Nations.

He had to reconcile a people smarting under the\r\nsting of English disdain and dislike to meet an insolent demand to\r\ngive up men we had taken from an English ship, when every man in the\r\nUnited States believed England would have taken them from us in a like\r\ncase; and to do this not only without dishonor, but so as to turn an\r\napparent defeat into victory. The English cabinet, as is often the case\r\nwith men who act arrogantly, acted hastily. They put their demand and\r\ntheir menace of war on grounds which justified us and put them in the\r\nwrong on the great contention which had existed from the beginning of\r\nour government. The United States had been, till the outbreak of the\r\ncivil war, and hoped to be forever after that war was over, a great\r\nneutral power. She was concerned to establish the immunity of the decks\r\nof her ships. Sumner saw and seized our opportunity. Great as was\r\nthe influence of President Lincoln, it seems unlikely that even his\r\nauthority would have reconciled the American people to the surrender\r\nof Mason and Slidell without the support of Sumner. It would certainly\r\nhave been a terrible strain upon his administration.\r\n\r\nNone of these speeches bears the marks of haste. In general no\r\nimportant consideration is overlooked and no important authority fails\r\nto be cited. Several of them were addressed to the Senate at a time\r\nwhen in the beginning he was able to convince scarcely anybody but\r\nhimself. But in the end Senate and people came to his opinion.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat what I said in reviewing Mr. Pierce's admirable\r\nbiography:--\r\n\r\n    \"Let us hope that these volumes will always be a text-book for\r\n    Americans. Let successive generations be brought up on the story of\r\n    the noble life of Charles Sumner. Let the American youth think of\r\n    these things. They are things true, honest, just, lovely, and of\r\n    good report. There is virtue in them and praise, if there be any\r\n    virtue, and if there be any praise. They do not belong to fiction,\r\n    but to history. It is no Grecian, or Roman, or English heroism\r\n    that the youth is invited to study. Charles Sumner belongs to us.\r\n    His youth was spent under a humble American roof. His training\r\n    was in an American school and college. He sleeps in American\r\n    soil. He is ours, wholly and altogether. His figure will abide in\r\n    history like that of St. Michael in art, an emblem of celestial\r\n    purity, of celestial zeal, of celestial courage. It will go down\r\n    to immortality with its foot upon the dragon of slavery, and with\r\n    the sword of the spirit in its hand, but with a tender light in its\r\n    eye, and a human love in its smile. Guido and Raphael conceived\r\n    their 'inviolable saint,'\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"'Invulnerable, impenetrably armed;\r\n      Such high advantages his innocence\r\n      Gave him above his foe; not to have sinned,\r\n      Not to have disobeyed; in fight he stood\r\n      Unwearied, unobnoxious, to be pained\r\n      By wounds.'\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Michael of the painters, as a critic of genius akin to\r\n    their own has pointed out, rests upon his prostrate foe light\r\n    as a morning cloud, no muscle strained, with unhacked sword and\r\n    unruffled wings, his bright tunic and shining armor without a\r\n    rent or stain. Not so with our human champion. He had to bear the\r\n    bitterness and agony of a long and doubtful struggle, with common\r\n    weapons and against terrible odds. He came out of it with soiled\r\n    garments, and with a mortal wound, but without a regret and without\r\n    a memory of hate.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner will always be a foremost figure in our history. His\r\nname will be a name to conjure with. Whenever freedom is in peril;\r\nwhenever justice is menaced, whenever the race, whose right he\r\nvindicated, shall be trodden under foot, those lips of stone, from\r\nthe stately antechamber of the Senate, will again utter their high\r\ncommands. The noble form of Charles Sumner, to the vision of the lovers\r\nof liberty, will seem to take its place again in the front of the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Pass thou first, thou dauntless heart,\r\n    As thou wert wont of yore.\"\r\n\r\n  WORCESTER,\r\n  December, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE TRUE GRANDEUR OF NATIONS.\r\n\r\nAN ORATION BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES OF THE CITY OF BOSTON, JULY 4, 1845.\r\n\r\n    O, yet a nobler task awaits thy hand,\r\n    (For what can war but endless war still breed?)\r\n    Till truth and right from violence be freed.\r\n\r\n                        MILTON, _Sonnet to Fairfax_.\r\n\r\n    Pax optima rerum\r\n    Quas homini novisse datum est; pax una triumphis\r\n    Innumeris potior; pax custodire salutem\r\n    Et cives æquare potens.\r\n\r\n                SILIUS ITALICUS, _Punica_, Lib.

This irreconcilable incongruity between the symbol\r\n    of universal peace and the horrors of war, in my judgment, is\r\n    conclusive against the miraculous or supernatural character of the\r\n    transaction [the vision of Constantine].--I was agreeably surprised\r\n    to find that Mosheim concurred in these sentiments, for which I\r\n    will readily encounter the charge of Quakerism.--MILMAN, _History\r\n    of Christianity_, Book III. chap. 1.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When you see fighting, be peaceable; for a peaceable disposition\r\n    shuts the door of contention.

Et si les loups en faisaient de\r\n    même, quels hurlements! quelle boucherie! Et si les uns ou les\r\n    autres vous disaient _qu'ils aiment la gloire_, ... ne ririez-vous\r\n    pas de tout votre coeur de l'ingénuité de ces pauvres bêtes?--LA\r\n    BRUYÈRE, _Les Caractères: Des Jugements_.\r\n\r\n    He was disposed to dissent from the maxim, which had of late years\r\n    received very general assent, that the best security for the\r\n    continuance of peace was to be prepared for war. That was a maxim\r\n    which might have been applied to the nations of antiquity, and to\r\n    society in a comparatively barbarous and uncivilized state.... Men,\r\n    when they adopted such a maxim, and made large preparations in\r\n    time of peace that would be sufficient in time of war, were apt to\r\n    be influenced by the desire to put their efficiency to the test,\r\n    that all their great preparations and the result of their toil and\r\n    expense might not be thrown away.--EARL OF ABERDEEN, _Hansard's\r\n    Parliamentary Debates_, July 20, 1849.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Bellum para, si pacem velis_, was a maxim regarded by many as\r\n    containing an incontestable truth. It was one, in his opinion,\r\n    to be received with great caution, and admitting of much\r\n    qualification.... We should best consult the true interests of\r\n    the country by husbanding our resources in a time of peace, and,\r\n    instead of a lavish expenditure on all the means of defence, by\r\n    placing some trust in the latent and dormant energies of the\r\n    nation.--SIR ROBERT PEEL, _Hansard's Parliamentary Debates_, March\r\n    12, 1850.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Let us terminate this disastrous system of rival expenditure,\r\n    and mutually agree, with no hypocrisy, but in a manner and under\r\n    circumstances which can admit of no doubt,--by a reduction of\r\n    armaments,--that peace is really our policy.--MR. D'ISRAELI,\r\n    _Hansard's Parliamentary Debates_, July 21, 1859.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    All high titles of honor come hitherto from fighting. Your _Herzog_\r\n    (Duke, _Dux_) is Leader of Armies; your Earl (_Jarl_) is Strong\r\n    Man; your Marshal, Cavalry Horseshoer. A Millennium, or Reign of\r\n    Peace and Wisdom, having from of old been prophesied, and becoming\r\n    now daily more and more indubitable, may it not be apprehended that\r\n    such fighting titles will cease to be palatable, and new and higher\r\n    need to be devised?--CARLYLE, _Sartor Resartus_, Book III. chap. 7.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    After the memorable conflict of June, 1848, in which, as _Chef\r\n    de Bataillon_, he [Ary Scheffer] had shown a capacity for\r\n    military conduct not less remarked than his cool courage, General\r\n    Changarnier, then commanding the National Guard of Paris, tendered\r\n    to Scheffer's acceptance the cross of _Commandeur_. He replied,\r\n    \"Had this honorable distinction been offered to me in my quality\r\n    of Artist, and as a recognition of the merit of my works, I should\r\n    receive it with deference and satisfaction. But to carry about\r\n    me a decoration reminding me only of the horrors of civil war is\r\n    what I cannot consent to do.\"--ARY SCHEFFER, _Life by Mrs. Grote_,\r\n    Appendix.\r\n\r\n    Additional examples and illustrations have been introduced into\r\n    this Oration since its publication, but the argument and substance\r\n    remain the same. It was at the time the occasion of considerable\r\n    controversy, and many were disturbed by what Mr. Sumner called his\r\n    _Declaration of War against War_. This showed itself at the dinner\r\n    in Faneuil Hall immediately after the delivery. There was friendly\r\n    dissent also, as appears from the letters of Judge Story and Mr.\r\n    Prescott, which will be found in the biographies of those eminent\r\n    persons. A letter from John A. Andrew, afterwards the distinguished\r\n    Governor of Massachusetts, shows the completeness of his sympathy.\r\n    \"You will allow me to say, I hope,\" he writes, \"that I have read\r\n    the Oration with a satisfaction only equalled by that with which I\r\n    heard you on the 4th July. And while I thank you a thousand times\r\n    for the choice you made of a topic, as well as for the fidelity\r\n    and brilliant ability which you brought to its illustration,\r\n    (both, to my mind, defying the most carping criticism,) I cannot\r\n    help expressing also my gratitude to Providence, that here, in our\r\n    city of Boston, one has at last stepped forward to consecrate to\r\n    celestial hopes the day--the great day--which Americans have at\r\n    best heretofore held sacred only to memory.\"\r\n\r\n    The Oration was noticed extensively at home and abroad. Two\r\n    or more editions were printed by the City Government, one by\r\n    the booksellers, Messrs. W.D. Ticknor & Co., and several by the\r\n    American Peace Society, which has recently issued another, making\r\n    a small volume. Another edition appeared in London. Portions have\r\n    been printed and circulated as tracts. There was also an abridgment\r\n    in Philadelphia, edited by Professor Charles D. Cleveland, and\r\n    another in Liverpool, by Mr. Richard Rathbone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with uninterrupted usage, on this Sabbath of the Nation,\r\nwe have put aside our daily cares, and seized a respite from the\r\nnever-ending toils of life, to meet in gladness and congratulation,\r\nmindful of the blessings transmitted from the Past, mindful also, I\r\ntrust, of our duties to the Present and the Future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll hearts turn first to the Fathers of the Republic. Their venerable\r\nforms rise before us, in the procession of successive generations.\r\nThey come from the frozen rock of Plymouth, from the wasted bands of\r\nRaleigh, from the heavenly companionship of Penn, from the anxious\r\ncouncils of the Revolution,--from all those fields of sacrifice, where,\r\nin obedience to the spirit of their age, they sealed their devotion\r\nto duty with their blood. They say to us, their children, \"Cease to\r\nvaunt what you do, and what has been done for you. Learn to walk meekly\r\nand to think humbly. Cultivate habits of self-sacrifice. Never aim at\r\nwhat is not RIGHT, persuaded that without this every possession and\r\nall knowledge will become an evil and a shame. And may these words of\r\nours be ever in your minds! Strive to increase the inheritance we have\r\nbequeathed to you,--bearing in mind always, that, if we excel you in\r\nvirtue, such a victory will be to us a mortification, while defeat\r\nwill bring happiness. In this way you may conquer us. Nothing is more\r\nshameful for a man than a claim to esteem, not on his own merits, but\r\non the fame of his ancestors. The glory of the fathers is doubtless\r\nto their children a most precious treasure; but to enjoy it without\r\ntransmission to the next generation, and without addition, is the\r\nextreme of ignominy. Following these counsels, when your days on earth\r\nare finished, you will come to join us, and we shall receive you as\r\nfriend receives friend; but if you neglect our words, expect no happy\r\ngreeting from us.\"[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] This is borrowed almost literally from the words attributed by\r\nPlato to the Fathers of Athens, in the beautiful funeral discourse of\r\nthe Menexenus.\r\n\r\nHonor to the memory of our fathers! May the turf lie lightly on their\r\nsacred graves! Not in words only, but in deeds also, let us testify\r\nour reverence for their name, imitating what in them was lofty, pure,\r\nand good, learning from them to bear hardship and privation. May we,\r\nwho now reap in strength what they sowed in weakness, augment the\r\ninheritance we have received! To this end, we must not fold our hands\r\nin slumber, nor abide content with the past. To each generation is\r\nappointed its peculiar task; nor does the heart which responds to the\r\ncall of duty find rest except in the grave.\r\n\r\nBe ours the task now in the order of Providence cast upon us. And\r\nwhat is this duty? What can we do to make our coming welcome to our\r\nfathers in the skies, and draw to our memory hereafter the homage of\r\na grateful posterity? How add to the inheritance received? The answer\r\nmust interest all, particularly on this festival, when we celebrate\r\nthe Nativity of the Republic. It well becomes the patriot citizen, on\r\nthis anniversary, to consider the national character, and how it may be\r\nadvanced,--as the good man dedicates his birthday to meditation on his\r\nlife, and to resolutions of improvement. Avoiding, then, all exultation\r\nin the abounding prosperity of the land, and in that freedom whose\r\ninfluence is widening to the uttermost circles of the earth, I would\r\nturn attention to the character of our country, and humbly endeavor to\r\nlearn what must be done that the Republic may best secure the welfare\r\nof the people committed to its care,--that it may perform its part in\r\nthe world's history,--that it may fulfil the aspirations of generous\r\nhearts,--and, practising that righteousness which exalteth a nation,\r\nattain to the elevation of True Grandeur.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith this aim, and believing that I can in no other way so fitly fulfil\r\nthe trust reposed in me to-day, I purpose to consider _what, in our\r\nage, are the true objects of national ambition,--what is truly National\r\nHonor, National Glory_,--WHAT IS THE TRUE GRANDEUR OF NATIONS. I would\r\nnot depart from the modesty that becomes me, yet I am not without hope\r\nthat I may do something to rescue these terms, now so powerful over the\r\nminds of men, from mistaken objects, especially from deeds of war, and\r\nthe extension of empire, that they may be applied to works of justice\r\nand beneficence, which are better than war or empire.\r\n\r\nThe subject may be novel, on an occasion like the present; but it is\r\ncomprehensive, and of transcendent importance. It raises us to the\r\ncontemplation of things not temporary or local, but belonging to all\r\nages and countries,--things lofty as Truth, universal as Humanity.\r\nNay, more; it practically concerns the general welfare, not only of\r\nour own cherished Republic, but of the whole Federation of Nations. It\r\nhas an urgent interest from transactions in which we are now unhappily\r\ninvolved. By an act of unjust legislation, extending our power over\r\nTexas, peace with Mexico is endangered,--while, by petulant assertion\r\nof a disputed claim to a remote territory beyond the Rocky Mountains,\r\nancient fires of hostile strife are kindled anew on the hearth of\r\nour mother country. Mexico and England both avow the determination\r\nto vindicate what is called the _National Honor_; and our Government\r\ncalmly contemplates the dread Arbitrament of War, provided it cannot\r\nobtain what is called an honorable peace.\r\n\r\nFar from our nation and our age be the sin and shame of contests\r\nhateful in the sight of God and all good men, having their origin in no\r\nrighteous sentiment, no true love of country, no generous thirst for\r\nfame, \"that last infirmity of noble mind,\" but springing manifestly\r\nfrom an ignorant and ignoble passion for new territory, strengthened,\r\nin our case, in a republic whose star is Liberty, by unnatural desire\r\nto add new links in chains destined yet to fall from the limbs of the\r\nunhappy slave! In such contests God has no attribute which can join\r\nwith us. Who believes that the national honor would be promoted by a\r\nwar with Mexico or a war with England? What just man would sacrifice\r\na single human life to bring under our rule both Texas and Oregon?\r\nAn ancient Roman, ignorant of Christian truth, touched only by the\r\nrelation of fellow-countryman, and not of fellow-man, said, as he\r\nturned aside from a career of Asiatic conquest, that he would rather\r\nsave the life of a single citizen than win to his power all the\r\ndominions of Mithridates.[3]\r\n\r\n    [3] Plutarch, _Lucullus_, Cap. VIII.\r\n\r\nA war with Mexico would be mean and cowardly; with England it would be\r\nbold at least, though parricidal. The heart sickens at the murderous\r\nattack upon an enemy distracted by civil feud, weak at home, impotent\r\nabroad; but it recoils in horror from the deadly shock between children\r\nof a common ancestry, speaking the same language, soothed in infancy\r\nby the same words of love and tenderness, and hardened into vigorous\r\nmanhood under the bracing influence of institutions instinct with the\r\nsame vital breath of freedom. The Roman historian has aptly pictured\r\nthis unnatural combat. Rarely do words of the past so justly describe\r\nthe present. _Curam acuebat, quod adversus Latinos bellandum erat,\r\nlingua, moribus, armorum genere, institutis ante omnia militaribus\r\ncongruentes: milites militibus, centurionibus centuriones, tribuni\r\ntribunis compares collegæque, iisdem præsidiis, sæpe iisdem manipulis\r\npermixti fuerant._[4]\r\n\r\n    [4] Livy, Hist., Lib. VIII. c. 6.\r\n\r\nCan there be in our age any peace that is not honorable, any war that\r\nis not dishonorable? The true honor of a nation is conspicuous only\r\nin deeds of justice and beneficence, securing and advancing human\r\nhappiness. In the clear eye of that Christian judgment which must yet\r\nprevail, vain are the victories of War, infamous its spoils. He is the\r\nbenefactor, and worthy of honor, who carries comfort to wretchedness,\r\ndries the tear of sorrow, relieves the unfortunate, feeds the hungry,\r\nclothes the naked, does justice, enlightens the ignorant, unfastens\r\nthe fetters of the slave, and finally, by virtuous genius, in art,\r\nliterature, science, enlivens and exalts the hours of life, or,\r\nby generous example, inspires a love for God and man. This is the\r\nChristian hero; this is the man of honor in a Christian land. He is no\r\nbenefactor, nor worthy of honor, whatever his worldly renown, whose\r\nlife is absorbed in feats of brute force, who renounces the great law\r\nof Christian brotherhood, whose vocation is blood. Well may the modern\r\npoet exclaim, \"The world knows nothing of its greatest men!\"--for thus\r\nfar it has chiefly honored the violent brood of Battle, armed men\r\nspringing up from the dragon's teeth sown by Hate, and cared little\r\nfor the truly good men, children of Love, guiltless of their country's\r\nblood, whose steps on earth are noiseless as an angel's wing.\r\n\r\nIt will not be disguised that this standard differs from that of the\r\nworld even in our day. The voice of man is yet given to martial praise,\r\nand the honors of victory are chanted even by the lips of woman. The\r\nmother, rocking the infant on her knee, stamps the images of War upon\r\nhis tender mind, at that age more impressible than wax; she nurses his\r\nslumber with its music, pleases his waking hours with its stories, and\r\nselects for his playthings the plume and the sword. From the child is\r\nformed the man; and who can weigh the influence of a mother's spirit\r\non the opinions of his life? The mind which trains the child is like\r\na hand at the end of a long lever; a gentle effort suffices to heave\r\nthe enormous weight of succeeding years. As the boy advances to youth,\r\nhe is fed like Achilles, not on honey and milk only, but on bears'\r\nmarrow and lions' hearts. He draws the nutriment of his soul from a\r\nliterature whose beautiful fields are moistened by human blood. Fain\r\nwould I offer my tribute to the Father of Poetry, standing with harp\r\nof immortal melody on the misty mountain-top of distant Antiquity,--to\r\nthose stories of courage and sacrifice which emblazon the annals of\r\nGreece and Rome,--to the fulminations of Demosthenes and the splendors\r\nof Tully,--to the sweet verse of Virgil and the poetic prose of Livy;\r\nfain would I offer my tribute to the new literature, which shot up\r\nin modern times as a vigorous forest from the burnt site of ancient\r\nwoods,--to the passionate song of the Troubadour in France and the\r\nMinnesinger in Germany,--to the thrilling ballad of Spain and the\r\ndelicate music of the Italian lyre: but from all these has breathed\r\nthe breath of War, that has swept the heart-strings of men in all the\r\nthronging generations.\r\n\r\nAnd when the youth becomes a man, his country invites his service\r\nin war, and holds before his bewildered imagination the prizes of\r\nworldly honor. For him the pen of the historian and the verse of the\r\npoet. His soul is taught to swell at the thought that he, too, is a\r\nsoldier,--that his name shall be entered on the list of those who have\r\nborne arms for their country; and perhaps he dreams that he, too, may\r\nsleep, like the Great Captain of Spain, with a hundred trophies over\r\nhis grave. The law of the land throws its sanction over this frenzy.\r\nThe contagion spreads beyond those subject to positive obligation.\r\nPeaceful citizens volunteer to appear as soldiers, and affect, in\r\ndress, arms, and deportment, what is called the \"pride, pomp, and\r\ncircumstance of glorious war.\" The ear-piercing fife has to-day filled\r\nour streets, and we have come to this church, on this National Sabbath,\r\nby the thump of drum and with the parade of bristling bayonets.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange, then, that the Spirit of War still finds a home\r\namong us, nor that its honors continue to be regarded. All this may\r\nseem to illustrate the bitter philosophy of Hobbes, declaring that the\r\nnatural state of mankind is War, and to sustain the exulting language\r\nof the soldier in our own day, when he wrote, \"War is the condition of\r\nthis world. From man to the smallest insect, all are at strife; and\r\nthe glory of arms, which cannot be obtained without the exercise of\r\nhonor, fortitude, courage, obedience, modesty, and temperance, excites\r\nthe brave man's patriotism, and is a chastening corrective for the\r\nrich man's pride.\"[5] This is broad and bold. In madder mood, another\r\nBritish general is reported as saying, \"Why, man, do you know that a\r\ngrenadier is the _greatest character_ in this world,\"--and after a\r\nmoment's pause, with the added emphasis of an oath, \"and, I believe,\r\nin the next, too.\"[6] All these spoke in harmony. If one is true, all\r\nare true. A French voice has struck another note, chanting nothing less\r\nthan the divinity of war, hailing it as \"divine\" in itself,--\"divine\"\r\nin its consequences,--\"divine\" in mysterious glory and seductive\r\nattraction,--\"divine\" in the manner of its declaration,--\"divine\" in\r\nthe results obtained,--\"divine\" in the undefinable force by which its\r\ntriumph is determined;[7] and the whole earth, continually imbibing\r\nblood, is nothing but an immense altar, where life is immolated without\r\nend, without measure, without respite. But this oracle is not saved\r\nfrom rejection even by the magistral style in which it is delivered.\r\n\r\n    [5] Napier, Peninsular War, Book XXIV. ch. 6, Vol. VI. p. 688.\r\n\r\n    [6] Southey, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society, Coll.\r\nVIII., Vol. I. p. 211.\r\n\r\n    [7] Joseph de Maistre, Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg, Tom. II. pp. 27,\r\n32-35.\r\n\r\nAlas! in the existing attitude of nations, the infidel philosopher\r\nand the rhetorical soldier, to say nothing of the giddy general and\r\nthe French priest of Mars, find too much support for a theory which\r\ndegrades human nature and insults the goodness of God. It is true\r\nthat in us are impulses unhappily tending to strife. Propensities\r\npossessed in common with the beast, if not subordinated to what in\r\nman is human, almost divine, will break forth in outrage. This is\r\nthe predominance of the animal. Hence wars and fightings, with the\r\nfalse glory which crowns such barbarism. But the true civilization of\r\nnations, as of individuals, is determined by the extent to which these\r\nevil dispositions are restrained. Nor does the teacher ever more truly\r\nperform his high office than when, recognizing the supremacy of the\r\nmoral and intellectual, he calls upon nations, as upon individuals,\r\nto declare independence of the bestial, to abandon practices founded\r\non this part of our nature, and in every way to beat down that brutal\r\nspirit which is the Genius of War. In making this appeal, he will be\r\nstartled as he learns, that, while the municipal law of each Christian\r\nnation, discarding the Arbitrament of Force, provides a judicial\r\ntribunal for the determination of controversies between individuals,\r\nInternational Law expressly _establishes_ the Arbitrament of War for\r\nthe determination of controversies between nations.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in unfolding the True Grandeur of Nations, we encounter\r\na practice, or _custom_, sanctioned by the Law of Nations, and\r\nconstituting a part of that law, which exists in defiance of principles\r\nsuch as no individuals can disown. If it is wrong and inglorious when\r\nindividuals _consent and agree_ to determine their petty controversies\r\nby combat, it must be equally wrong and inglorious when nations\r\n_consent and agree_ to determine their vaster controversies by\r\ncombat. Here is a positive, precise, and specific evil, of gigantic\r\nproportions, inconsistent with what is truly honorable, making within\r\nthe sphere of its influence all true grandeur impossible, which,\r\ninstead of proceeding from some uncontrollable impulse of our nature,\r\nis _expressly established and organized by law_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs all citizens are parties to Municipal Law, and responsible for its\r\ninstitutions, so are all the Christian nations parties to International\r\nLaw, and responsible for its provisions. By recognizing these\r\nprovisions, nations _consent and agree_ beforehand to the Arbitrament\r\nof War, precisely as citizens, by recognizing Trial by Jury, _consent\r\nand agree_ beforehand to the latter tribunal. As, to comprehend the\r\ntrue nature of Trial by Jury, we first repair to the Municipal Law\r\nby which it is established, so, to comprehend the true nature of the\r\nArbitrament of War, we must first repair to the Law of Nations.\r\n\r\nWriters of genius and learning have defined this arbitrament, and laid\r\ndown the rules by which it is governed, constituting a complex code,\r\nwith innumerable subtile provisions regulating the resort to it and\r\nthe manner in which it must be conducted, called the _Laws of War_. In\r\nthese quarters we catch our first authentic glimpses of its folly and\r\nwickedness. According to Lord Bacon, whose authority is always great,\r\n\"Wars are no massacres and confusions, but they are the highest _Trials\r\nof Right_, when princes and states, that acknowledge no superior upon\r\nearth, shall put themselves upon the justice of God _for the deciding\r\nof their_ _controversies_ by such success as it shall please him to\r\ngive on either side.\"[8] This definition of the English philosopher is\r\nadopted by the American jurist, Chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries on\r\nAmerican Law.[9] The Swiss publicist, Vattel, whose work is accepted\r\nas an important repository of the Law of Nations, defines War as \"that\r\nstate in which a nation _prosecutes its right by force_.\"[10] In this\r\nhe very nearly follows the eminent Dutch authority, Bynkershoek,\r\nwho says, \"Bellum est eorum, qui suæ potestatis sunt, _juris sui\r\npersequendi ergo_, concertatio per vim vel dolum.\"[11] Mr. Whewell, who\r\nhas done so much to illustrate philosophy in all its departments, says,\r\nin his recent work on the Elements of Morality and Polity, \"Though war\r\nis appealed to, because there is no other ULTIMATE TRIBUNAL to which\r\nstates can have recourse, _it is appealed to for justice_.\"[12] And\r\nin our country, Dr. Lieber says, in a work of learning and sagacious\r\nthought, that war is undertaken \"in order to obtain right,\"[13]--a\r\ndefinition which hardly differs in form from those of Vattel and\r\nBynkershoek.\r\n\r\n    [8] Observations upon a Libel, etc., Works, Vol. III. p. 40.\r\n\r\n    [9] Lecture III., Vol. I. p. 45.\r\n\r\n    [10] Book III. ch. 1, sec. 1.\r\n\r\n    [11] Quæst. Jur. Pub., Lib. I. cap. 1.\r\n\r\n    [12] Book VI. ch. 2. art. 1146.\r\n\r\n    [13] Political Ethics, Book VII. sec. 19, Vol. II. p. 643.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these texts, I would now define the evil which I\r\narraign. _War is a public armed contest between nations, under the\r\nsanction of International Law, to establish_ JUSTICE _between them_:\r\nas, for instance, to determine a disputed boundary, the title to\r\nterritory, or a claim for damages.\r\n\r\nThis definition is confined to contests between nations. It is\r\nrestricted to International War, carefully excluding the question,\r\noften agitated, concerning the right of revolution, and that other\r\nquestion, on which friends of peace sometimes differ, the right\r\nof personal self-defence. It does not in any way throw doubt on\r\nthe employment of force in the administration of justice or the\r\nconservation of domestic quiet.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the term _defensive_ is always applied to wars in\r\nour day. And it is creditable to the moral sense that nations are\r\nconstrained to allege this seeming excuse, although its absurdity\r\nis apparent in the equal pretensions of the two belligerents, each\r\nclaiming to act on the defensive. It is unreasonable to suppose that\r\nwar can arise in the present age, under the sanctions of International\r\nLaw, except to determine an _asserted right_. Whatever its character\r\nin periods of barbarism, or when invoked to repel an incursion of\r\nrobbers or pirates, \"enemies of the human race,\" war becomes in our\r\nday, _among all the nations parties to existing International Law_,\r\nsimply a mode of litigation, or of deciding a _lis pendens_. It is\r\na mere TRIAL OF RIGHT, an appeal for justice to force. The wars now\r\nlowering from Mexico and England are of this character. On the one\r\nside, we assert a _title_ to Texas, _which is disputed_; on the other,\r\nwe assert a _title_ to Oregon, _which is disputed_. Only according to\r\n\"martial logic,\" or the \"flash language\" of a dishonest patriotism,\r\ncan the Ordeal by Battle be regarded in these causes, on either side,\r\nas _Defensive War_. Nor did the threatened war with France in 1834\r\npromise to assume any different character. Its professed object was\r\nto obtain the payment of five million dollars,--in other words, to\r\ndetermine by this _Ultimate_ _Tribunal_ a simple question of justice.\r\nAnd going back still farther in our history, the avowed purpose of the\r\nwar against Great Britain in 1812 was to obtain from the latter power\r\nan abandonment of the claim to search American vessels. Unrighteous as\r\nwas this claim, it is plain that war here was invoked only as a _Trial\r\nof Right_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt forms no part of my purpose to consider individual wars in the past,\r\nexcept so far as necessary by way of example. My aim is higher. I wish\r\nto expose an irrational, cruel, and impious _custom_, sanctioned by the\r\nLaw of Nations. On this account I resort to that supreme law for the\r\ndefinition on which I plant myself in the effort I now make.\r\n\r\nAfter considering, in succession, _first_, the character of war,\r\n_secondly_, the miseries it produces, and, _thirdly_, its utter and\r\npitiful insufficiency, as a mode of determining justice, we shall\r\nbe able to decide, strictly and logically, whether it must not be\r\nranked as crime, from which no true honor can spring to individuals or\r\nnations. To appreciate this evil, and the necessity for its overthrow,\r\nit will be our duty, _fourthly_, to consider in succession the various\r\nprejudices by which it is sustained, ending with that prejudice, so\r\ngigantic and all-embracing, at whose command uncounted sums are madly\r\ndiverted from purposes of peace to preparations for war. The whole\r\nsubject is infinitely practical, while the concluding division shows\r\nhow the public treasury may be relieved, and new means secured for\r\nhuman advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the essential character and root of war, or that part of\r\nour nature whence it proceeds. Listen to the voice from the ancient\r\npoet of Boeotian Ascra:--\r\n\r\n    \"This is the law for mortals, ordained by the Ruler of Heaven:\r\n    Fishes and beasts and birds of the air devour each other;\r\n    JUSTICE _dwells not among them: only to_ MAN _has he given_\r\n    JUSTICE _the Highest and Best_.\"[14]\r\n\r\n    [14] Hesiod, Works and Days, vv. 276-279. Cicero also says, \"Neque ulla\r\nre longius absumus a natura ferarum, in quibus inesse fortitudinem sæpe\r\ndicimus, ut in equis, in leonibus; justitiam, æquitatem, bonitatem non\r\ndicimus.\"--De Offic., Lib. I. cap. 16.\r\n\r\nThese words of old Hesiod exhibit the distinction between man and\r\nbeast; but this very distinction belongs to the present discussion.\r\nThe idea rises to the mind at once, that war is a resort to brute\r\nforce, where nations strive to overpower each other. Reason, and the\r\ndivine part of our nature, where alone we differ from the beast, where\r\nalone we approach the Divinity, where alone are the elements of that\r\n_justice_ which is the professed object of war, are rudely dethroned.\r\nFor the time men adopt the nature of beasts, emulating their ferocity,\r\nlike them rejoicing in blood, and with lion's paw clutching an asserted\r\nright. Though in more recent days this character is somewhat disguised\r\nby the skill and knowledge employed, war is still the same, only\r\nmore destructive from the genius and intellect which have become its\r\nservants. The primitive poets, in the unconscious simplicity of the\r\nworld's childhood, make this boldly apparent. The heroes of Homer\r\nare likened to animals in ungovernable fury, or to things devoid of\r\nreason or affection. Menelaus presses his way through the crowd \"like\r\na wild beast.\" Sarpedon is aroused against the Argives, \"as a lion\r\nagainst the crooked-horned oxen,\" and afterwards rushes forward \"like\r\na lion nurtured on the mountains, for a long time famished for want of\r\nflesh, but whose courage impels him to attack even the well-guarded\r\nsheep-fold.\" In one and the same passage, the great Telamonian Ajax is\r\n\"wild beast,\" \"tawny lion,\" and \"dull ass\"; and all the Greek chiefs,\r\nthe flower of the camp, are ranged about Diomed, \"like raw-eating\r\nlions, or wild-boars, whose strength is irresistible.\" Even Hector,\r\nthe model hero, with all the virtues of war, is praised as \"tamer of\r\nhorses\"; and one of his renowned feats in battle, indicating brute\r\nstrength only, is where he takes up and hurls a stone which two of\r\nour strongest men could not easily lift into a wagon; and he drives\r\nover dead bodies and shields, while the axle is defiled by gore, and\r\nthe guard about the seat is sprinkled from the horses' hoofs and the\r\ntires of the wheels;[15] and in that most admired passage of ancient\r\nliterature, before returning his child, the young Astyanax, to the arms\r\nof the wife he is about to leave, this hero of war invokes the gods for\r\na single blessing on the boy's head,--\"that he may excel his father,\r\nand bring home _bloody spoils_, his enemy being slain, and _so make\r\nglad the heart of his mother_!\"\r\n\r\n    [15] Little better than Trojan Hector was the \"great\" Condé ranging\r\nover the field and exulting in the blood of the enemy, which defiled\r\nhis sword-arm to the elbow.--Mahon, Essai sur la Vie du Grand Condé, p.\r\n60.\r\n\r\nFrom early fields of modern literature, as from those of antiquity,\r\nmight be gathered similar illustrations, showing the unconscious\r\ndegradation of the soldier, in vain pursuit of _justice_, renouncing\r\nthe human character, to assume that of brute. Bayard, the exemplar of\r\nchivalry, with a name always on the lips of its votaries, was described\r\nby the qualities of beasts, being, according to his admirers, _ram in\r\nattack, wild-boar in defence, and wolf in flight_. Henry the Fifth, as\r\nrepresented by our own Shakespeare, in the spirit-stirring appeal to\r\nhis troops exclaims,--\r\n\r\n        \"When the blast of war blows in our ears,\r\n    _Then imitate the action of the tiger_.\"\r\n\r\nThis is plain and frank, revealing the true character of war.\r\n\r\nI need not dwell on the moral debasement that must ensue. Passions,\r\nlike so many bloodhounds, are unleashed and suffered to rage. Crimes\r\nfilling our prisons stalk abroad in the soldier's garb, unwhipped of\r\njustice. Murder, robbery, rape, arson, are the sports of this fiendish\r\nSaturnalia, when\r\n\r\n    \"The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,\r\n     And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart,\r\n     In liberty of bloody hand shall range\r\n    _With conscience wide as hell_.\"\r\n\r\nBy a bold, but truthful touch, Shakespeare thus pictures the foul\r\ndisfigurement which war produces in man, whose native capacities he\r\ndescribes in those beautiful words: \"How noble in reason! how infinite\r\nin faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action\r\nhow like an angel! in apprehension how like a god!\" And yet this\r\nnobility of reason, this infinitude of faculties, this marvel of form\r\nand motion, this nature so angelic, so godlike, are all, under the\r\ntransforming power of War, lost in the action of the beast, or the\r\nlicense of the fleshed soldier with bloody hand and conscience wide as\r\nhell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of war is to sever all relations of friendship and\r\ncommerce between the belligerent nations, and every individual thereof,\r\nimpressing upon each citizen or subject the character of enemy.\r\nImagine this instant change between England and the United States. The\r\ninnumerable ships of the two countries, the white doves of commerce,\r\nbearing the olive of peace, are driven from the sea, or turned from\r\npeaceful purposes to be ministers of destruction; the threads of social\r\nand business intercourse, so carefully woven into a thick web, are\r\nsuddenly snapped asunder; friend can no longer communicate with friend;\r\nthe twenty thousand letters speeded each fortnight from this port alone\r\nare arrested, and the human affections, of which they are the precious\r\nexpression, seek in vain for utterance. Tell me, you with friends\r\nand kindred abroad, or you bound to other lands only by relations of\r\ncommerce, are you ready for this rude separation?\r\n\r\nThis is little compared with what must follow. It is but the first\r\nportentous shadow of disastrous eclipse, twilight usher of thick\r\ndarkness, covering the whole heavens with a pall, broken only by the\r\nlightnings of battle and siege.\r\n\r\nSuch horrors redden the historic page, while, to the scandal of\r\nhumanity, they never want historians with feelings kindred to those by\r\nwhich they are inspired. The demon that draws the sword also guides the\r\npen. The favorite chronicler of modern Europe, Froissart, discovers\r\nhis sympathies in his Prologue, where, with something of apostleship,\r\nhe announces his purpose, \"that the honorable enterprises and noble\r\nadventures and feats of arms which happened in the wars of France and\r\nEngland be notably registered and put in perpetual memory,\" and then\r\nproceeds to bestow his equal admiration upon bravery and cunning, upon\r\nthe courtesy which pardoned as upon the rage which caused the flow\r\nof blood in torrents, dwelling with especial delight on \"beautiful\r\nincursions, beautiful rescues, beautiful feats of arms, and beautiful\r\nprowesses\"; and wantoning in pictures of cities assaulted, \"which,\r\nbeing soon gained by force, were robbed, and men and women and children\r\nput to the sword without mercy, while the churches were burnt and\r\nviolated.\"[16] This was in a barbarous age. But popular writers in\r\nour own day, dazzled by false ideas of greatness, at which reason and\r\nhumanity blush, do not hesitate to dwell on similar scenes even with\r\nrapture and eulogy. The humane soul of Wilberforce, which sighed that\r\nEngland's \"bloody laws sent many unprepared into another world,\" could\r\nhail the slaughter of Waterloo, by which thousands were hurried into\r\neternity on the Sabbath he held so holy, as a \"splendid victory.\"[17]\r\n\r\n    [16] Froissart, Les Chroniques, Ch. 177, 179, Collection de Buchon,\r\nTom.

At Tarragona, above six thousand\r\nhuman beings, almost all defenceless, men and women, gray hairs and\r\ninfant innocence, attractive youth and wrinkled age, were butchered\r\nby the infuriate troops in one night, and the morning sun rose upon a\r\ncity whose streets and houses were inundated with blood: and yet this\r\nis called a \"glorious exploit.\"[18] Here was a conquest by the French.\r\nAt a later day, Ciudad Rodrigo was stormed by the British, when, in\r\nthe license of victory, there ensued a savage scene of plunder and\r\nviolence, while shouts and screams on all sides mingled fearfully with\r\nthe groans of the wounded. Churches were desecrated, cellars of wine\r\nand spirits were pillaged, fire was wantonly applied to the city, and\r\nbrutal intoxication spread in every direction. Only when the drunken\r\ndropped from excess, or fell asleep, was any degree of order restored:\r\nand yet the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo is pronounced \"one of the most\r\nbrilliant exploits of the British army.\"[19] This \"beautiful feat of\r\narms\" was followed by the storming of Badajoz, where the same scenes\r\nwere enacted again, with accumulated atrocities. The story shall\r\nbe told in the words of a partial historian, who himself saw what\r\nhe eloquently describes. \"Shameless rapacity, brutal intemperance,\r\nsavage lust, cruelty, and murder, shrieks and piteous lamentations,\r\ngroans, shouts, imprecations, the hissing of fires bursting from the\r\nhouses, the crashing of doors and windows, and the reports of muskets\r\nused in violence, resounded for two days and nights in the streets of\r\nBadajoz. On the third, when the city was sacked, when the soldiers\r\nwere exhausted by their own excesses, the tumult rather subsided than\r\nwas quelled. The wounded men were then looked to, the dead disposed\r\nof.\"[20] All this is in the nature of confession, for the historian is\r\na partisan of battle.\r\n\r\n    [18] Alison, Hist. of Europe, Ch. 61, Vol. VIII. p. 237.\r\n\r\n    [19] Ibid., Ch. 64, Vol. VIII. p. 482.\r\n\r\n    [20] Napier, Hist. Peninsular War, Book XVI. ch. 5, Vol. IV. p. 431.\r\n\r\nThe same terrible war affords another instance of atrocities at a siege\r\ncrying to Heaven. For weeks before the surrender of Saragossa, the\r\ndeaths daily were from four to five hundred; and as the living could\r\nnot bury the increasing mass, thousands of carcasses, scattered in\r\nstreets and court-yards, or piled in heaps at the doors of churches,\r\nwere left to dissolve in their own corruption, or be licked up by\r\nthe flames of burning houses. The city was shaken to its foundations\r\nby sixteen thousand shells, and the explosion of forty-five thousand\r\npounds of powder in the mines,--while the bones of forty thousand\r\nvictims, of every age and both sexes, bore dreadful testimony to the\r\nunutterable cruelty of War.[21]\r\n\r\n    [21] Napier, Book V. ch. 3, Vol. II. p. 46.\r\n\r\nThese might seem pictures from the life of Alaric, who led the Goths\r\nto Rome, or of Attila, general of the Huns, called the Scourge of God,\r\nand who boasted that the grass did not grow where his horse had set\r\nhis foot; but no! they belong to our own times. They are portions of\r\nthe wonderful, but wicked, career of him who stands forth the foremost\r\nrepresentative of worldly grandeur. The heart aches, as we follow him\r\nand his marshals from field to field of Satanic glory,[22] finding\r\neverywhere, from Spain to Russia, the same carnival of woe. The picture\r\nis various, yet the same. Suffering, wounds, and death, in every form,\r\nfill the terrible canvas. What scene more dismal than that of Albuera,\r\nwith its horrid piles of corpses, while all night the rain pours down,\r\nand river, hill, and forest, on each side, resound with the cries\r\nand groans of the dying?[23] What scene more awfully monumental than\r\nSalamanca, where, long after the great battle, the ground, strewn with\r\nfragments of casques and cuirasses, was still white with the skeletons\r\nof those who fell?[24] What catalogue of horrors more complete than the\r\nRussian campaign? At every step is war, and this is enough: soldiers\r\nblack with powder; bayonets bent with the violence of the encounter;\r\nthe earth ploughed with cannon-shot; trees torn and mutilated; the dead\r\nand dying; wounds and agony; fields covered with broken carriages,\r\noutstretched horses, and mangled bodies; while disease, sad attendant\r\non military suffering, sweeps thousands from the great hospitals, and\r\nthe multitude of amputated limbs, which there is no time to destroy,\r\naccumulate in bloody heaps, filling the air with corruption. What\r\ntongue, what pen, can describe the bloody havoc at Borodino, where,\r\nbetween rise and set of a single sun, one hundred thousand of our\r\nfellow-men, equalling in number the whole population of this city, sank\r\nto earth, dead or wounded?[25] Fifty days after the battle, no less\r\nthan thirty thousand are found stretched where their last convulsions\r\nended, and the whole plain is strewn with half-buried carcasses of\r\nmen and horses, intermingled with garments dyed in blood, and bones\r\ngnawed by dogs and vultures.[26] Who can follow the French army in\r\ndismal retreat, avoiding the spear of the pursuing Cossack only to\r\nsink beneath the sharper frost and ice, in a temperature below zero,\r\non foot, without shelter for the body, famishing on horse-flesh and\r\na miserable compound of rye and snow-water? With a fresh array, the\r\nwar is upheld against new forces under the walls of Dresden; and as\r\nthe Emperor rides over the field of battle--after indulging the night\r\nbefore in royal supper with the Saxon king--he sees ghastly new-made\r\ngraves, with hands and arms projecting, stark and stiff, above the\r\nground; and shortly afterwards, when shelter is needed for the troops,\r\nthe order to occupy the Hospitals for the Insane is given, with the\r\nwords, \"Turn out the mad.\"[27]\r\n\r\n[22] A living poet of Italy, who will be placed by his prose among the\r\ngreat names of his country's literature, in a remarkable ode which he\r\nhas thrown on the urn of Napoleon invites posterity to judge whether\r\nhis career of battle was True Glory.\r\n\r\n\"Fu vera gloria?

But there is one other picture\r\nof the atrocious, though natural, consequences of war, occurring\r\nalmost within our own day, that I would not omit. Let me bring to your\r\nmind Genoa, called the Superb, City of Palaces, dear to the memory of\r\nAmerican childhood as the birthplace of Christopher Columbus, and one\r\nof the spots first enlightened by the morning beams of civilization,\r\nwhose merchants were princes, and whose rich argosies, in those early\r\ndays, introduced to Europe the choicest products of the East, the\r\nlinen of Egypt, the spices of Arabia, and the silks of Samarcand.\r\nShe still sits in queenly pride, as she sat then,--her mural crown\r\nstudded with towers,--her churches rich with marble floors and rarest\r\npictures,--her palaces of ancient doges and admirals yet spared by\r\nthe hand of Time,--her close streets thronged by a hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants,--at the foot of the Apennines, as they approach the blue\r\nand tideless waters of the Mediterranean Sea,--leaning her back\r\nagainst their strong mountain-sides, overshadowed by the foliage\r\nof the fig-tree and the olive, while the orange and the lemon with\r\npleasant perfume scent the air where reigns perpetual spring. Who can\r\ncontemplate such a city without delight? Who can listen to the story of\r\nher sorrows without a pang?\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the present century, the armies of the French\r\nRepublic, after dominating over Italy, were driven from their\r\nconquests, and compelled, with shrunken forces, to find shelter under\r\nMassena, within the walls of Genoa. Various efforts were made by the\r\nAustrian general, aided by bombardment from the British fleet, to\r\nforce the strong defences by assault. At length the city was invested\r\nby a strict blockade. All communication with the country was cut off,\r\nwhile the harbor was closed by the ever-wakeful British watch-dogs of\r\nwar. Besides the French troops, within the beleaguered and unfortunate\r\ncity are the peaceful, unoffending inhabitants. Provisions soon become\r\nscarce; scarcity sharpens into want, till fell Famine, bringing\r\nblindness and madness in her train, rages like an Erinnys. Picture\r\nto yourselves this large population, not pouring out their lives in\r\nthe exulting rush of battle, but wasting at noonday, daughter by the\r\nside of mother, husband by the side of wife. When grain and rice fail,\r\nflaxseed, millet, cocoa, and almonds are ground by hand-mills into\r\nflour, and even bran, baked with honey, is eaten, less to satisfy than\r\nto deaden hunger. Before the last extremities, a pound of horse-flesh\r\nis sold for thirty-two cents, a pound of bran for thirty cents, a pound\r\nof flour for one dollar and seventy-five cents. A single bean is soon\r\nsold for two cents, and a biscuit of three ounces for two dollars and\r\na quarter, till finally none can be had at any price. The wretched\r\nsoldiers, after devouring the horses, are reduced to the degradation\r\nof feeding on dogs, cats, rats, and worms, which are eagerly hunted in\r\ncellars and sewers. \"Happy were now,\" exclaims an Italian historian,\r\n\"not those who lived, but those who died!\" The day is dreary from\r\nhunger,--the night more dreary still, from hunger with delirious\r\nfancies. They now turn to herbs,--dock, sorrel, mallows, wild succory.\r\nPeople of every condition, with women of noble birth and beauty, seek\r\nupon the slope of the mountain within the defences those aliments which\r\nNature designed solely for beasts. Scanty vegetables, with a scrap of\r\ncheese, are all that can be afforded to the sick and wounded, those\r\nsacred stipendiaries of human charity. In the last anguish of despair,\r\nmen and women fill the air with groans and shrieks, some in spasms,\r\nconvulsions, and contortions, yielding their expiring breath on the\r\nunpitying stones of the street,--alas! not more unpitying than man.\r\nChildren, whom a dead mother's arms had ceased to protect, orphans of\r\nan hour, with piercing cries, supplicate in vain the compassion of the\r\npassing stranger: none pity or aid. The sweet fountains of sympathy\r\nare all closed by the selfishness of individual distress. In the\r\ngeneral agony, some precipitate themselves into the sea, while the more\r\nimpetuous rush from the gates, and impale their bodies on the Austrian\r\nbayonets. Others still are driven to devour their shoes and the leather\r\nof their pouches; and the horror of human flesh so far abates, that\r\nnumbers feed like cannibals on the corpses about them.[28]\r\n\r\n    [28] This account is drawn from the animated sketches of Botta (Storia\r\nd' Italia dal 1789 al 1814, Tom. III. Lib. 19), Alison (History of\r\nEurope, Vol. IV. ch. 30), and Arnold (Modern History, Lect. IV.). The\r\nhumanity of the last is particularly aroused to condemn this most\r\natrocious murder of innocent people, and, as a sufficient remedy, he\r\nsuggests a modification of the Laws of War, permitting non-combatants\r\nto withdraw from a blockaded town! In this way, indeed, they may\r\nbe spared a languishing death by starvation; but they must desert\r\nfiresides, pursuits, all that makes life dear, and become homeless\r\nexiles,--a fate little better than the former. It is strange that\r\nArnold's pure soul and clear judgment did not recognize the truth,\r\nthat the whole custom of war is unrighteous and unlawful, and that\r\nthe horrors of this siege are its natural consequence. Laws of War!\r\nLaws in what is lawless! rules of wrong! There can be only _one Law of\r\nWar_,--that is, the great law which pronounces it unwise, unjust, and\r\nunchristian.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the French general capitulated, claiming and receiving\r\nwhat are called \"the honors of war,\"--but not before twenty thousand\r\ninnocent persons, old and young, women and children, having no part\r\nor interest in the contest, had died the most horrible of deaths. The\r\nAustrian flag floated over captured Genoa but a brief span of time; for\r\nBonaparte had already descended like an eagle from the Alps, and in\r\nnine days afterwards, on the plains of Marengo, shattered the Austrian\r\nempire in Italy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut wasted lands, famished cities, and slaughtered armies are not all\r\nthat is contained in \"the purple testament of bleeding war.\" Every\r\nsoldier is connected with others, as all of you, by dear ties of\r\nkindred, love, and friendship. He has been sternly summoned from the\r\nembrace of family. To him there is perhaps an aged mother, who fondly\r\nhoped to lean her bending years on his more youthful form; perhaps a\r\nwife, whose life is just entwined inseparably with his, now condemned\r\nto wasting despair; perhaps sisters, brothers. As he falls on the field\r\nof war, must not all these rush with his blood? But who can measure the\r\ndistress that radiates as from a bloody sun, penetrating innumerable\r\nhomes? Who can give the gauge and dimensions of this infinite sorrow?\r\nTell me, ye who feel the bitterness of parting with dear friends and\r\nkindred, whom you watch tenderly till the last golden sands are run\r\nout and the great hour-glass is turned, what is the measure of your\r\nanguish? Your friend departs, soothed by kindness and in the arms of\r\nLove: the soldier gasps out his life with no friend near, while the\r\nscowl of Hate darkens all that he beholds, darkens his own departing\r\nsoul. Who can forget the anguish that fills the bosom and crazes the\r\nbrain of Lenore, in the matchless ballad of Bürger, when seeking in\r\nvain among returning squadrons for her lover left dead on Prague's\r\nensanguined plain? But every field of blood has many Lenores. All war\r\nis full of desolate homes, as is vividly pictured by a master poet of\r\nantiquity, whose verse is an argument.\r\n\r\n    \"But through the bounds of Grecia's land,\r\n     Who sent her sons for Troy to part,\r\n     See mourning, with much suffering heart,\r\n     On each man's threshold stand,\r\n     On each sad hearth in Grecia's land.\r\n     Well may her soul with grief be rent;\r\n     She well remembers whom she sent,\r\n     She sees them not return:\r\n     Instead of men, to each man's home\r\n     Urns and ashes only come,\r\n     And the armor which they wore,--\r\n     Sad relics to their native shore.\r\n     For Mars, the barterer of the lifeless clay,\r\n     Who sells for gold the slain,\r\n     _And holds the scale, in battle's doubtful day,\r\n     High balanced o'er the plain_,\r\n     From Ilium's walls for men returns\r\n     Ashes and sepulchral urns,--\r\n     Ashes wet with many a tear,\r\n     Sad relics of the fiery bier.\r\n     Round the full urns the general groan\r\n     Goes, as each their kindred own:\r\n     And one that 'mid the armed throng\r\n     He sunk in glory's slaughtering tide,\r\n     And for another's consort died.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Others they mourn whose monuments stand\r\n     By Ilium's walls on foreign strand;\r\n     Where they fell in beauty's bloom,\r\n     There they lie in hated tomb,\r\n     Sunk beneath the massy mound,\r\n     In eternal chambers bound.\"[29]\r\n\r\n    [29] Agamemnon of Æschylus: _Chorus_. This is from the beautiful\r\ntranslation by John Symmons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\nBut all these miseries are to no purpose. War is utterly ineffectual\r\nto secure or advance its professed object. The wretchedness it entails\r\ncontributes to no end, helps to establish no right, and therefore in no\r\nrespect determines _justice_ between the contending nations.\r\n\r\nThe fruitlessness and vanity of war appear in the great conflicts by\r\nwhich the world has been lacerated. After long struggle, where each\r\nnation inflicts and receives incalculable injury, peace is gladly\r\nobtained on the basis of the condition before the war, known as the\r\n_status ante bellum_. I cannot illustrate this futility better than\r\nby the familiar example--humiliating to both countries--of our last\r\nwar with Great Britain, where the professed object was to obtain a\r\nrenunciation of the British claim, so defiantly asserted, to impress\r\nour seamen. To overturn this injustice the Arbitrament of War was\r\ninvoked, and for nearly three years the whole country was under\r\nits terrible ban. American commerce was driven from the seas; the\r\nresources of the land were drained by taxation; villages on the\r\nCanadian frontier were laid in ashes; the metropolis of the Republic\r\nwas captured; while distress was everywhere within our borders. Weary\r\nat last with this rude trial, the National Government appointed\r\ncommissioners to treat for peace, with these specific instructions:\r\n\"Your first duty will be to conclude a peace with Great Britain; and\r\nyou are authorized to do it, _in case_ you obtain a satisfactory\r\nstipulation against impressment, one which shall secure under our\r\nflag protection to the crew.... If this encroachment of Great Britain\r\nis not provided against, _the United States have appealed to arms in\r\nvain_.\"[30] Afterwards, finding small chance of extorting from Great\r\nBritain a relinquishment of the unrighteous claim, and foreseeing\r\nfrom the inveterate prosecution of the war only an accumulation of\r\ncalamities, the National Government directed the negotiators, in\r\nconcluding a treaty, to \"_omit any stipulation on the subject of\r\nimpressment_.\"[31] These instructions were obeyed, and the treaty that\r\nrestored to us once more the blessings of peace, so rashly cast away,\r\nbut now hailed with intoxication of joy, contained no allusion to\r\nimpressment, nor did it provide for the surrender of a single American\r\nsailor detained in the British navy. Thus, by the confession of our own\r\nGovernment, \"the United States _had appealed to arms_ IN VAIN.\"[32]\r\nThese important words are not mine; they are words of the country.\r\n\r\n    [30] Mr. Monroe to Commissioners, April 15, 1813: American State\r\nPapers, Vol. VIII. pp. 577, 578.\r\n\r\n    [31] Mr. Monroe to Commissioners, June 27, 1814: Ibid., Vol. VIII. p.\r\n593.\r\n\r\n    [32] Mr. Jefferson, in more than one letter, declares the peace\r\n_an armistice only_, \"because no security is provided against the\r\nimpressment of our seamen.\"--Letter to Crawford, Feb. 11, 1815; to\r\nLafayette, Feb. 14, 1815: Works, Vol. VI. pp. 420, 427.\r\n\r\nAll this is the natural result of an appeal to war for the\r\ndetermination of _justice_. Justice implies the exercise of the\r\njudgment. Now war not only supersedes the judgment, but delivers over\r\nthe pending question to superiority of _force_, or to _chance_.\r\n\r\nSuperior force may end in conquest; this is the natural consequence;\r\nbut it cannot adjudicate any right. We expose the absurdity of its\r\narbitrament, when, by a familiar phrase of sarcasm, we deride _the\r\nright of the strongest_,--excluding, of course, all idea of right,\r\nexcept that of the lion as he springs upon a weaker beast, of the wolf\r\nas he tears in pieces the lamb, of the vulture as he devours the dove.\r\nThe grossest spirits must admit that this is not justice.\r\n\r\nBut the battle is not always to the strong. Superiority of force is\r\noften checked by the proverbial contingencies of war. Especially are\r\nsuch contingencies revealed in rankest absurdity, where nations, as is\r\nthe acknowledged _custom_, without regard to their respective forces,\r\nwhether weaker or stronger, voluntarily appeal to this mad umpirage.\r\nWho beforehand can measure the currents of the heady fight? In common\r\nlanguage, we confess the \"chances\" of battle; and soldiers devoted to\r\nthis harsh vocation yet call it a \"game.\" The Great Captain of our\r\nage, who seemed to drag victory at his chariot-wheels, in a formal\r\naddress to his officers, on entering Russia, says, \"In war, _fortune_\r\nhas an equal share with ability in success.\"[33] The famous victory of\r\nMarengo, accident of an accident, wrested unexpectedly at close of day\r\nfrom a foe at an earlier hour successful, taught him the uncertainty of\r\nwar. Afterwards, in bitterness of spirit, when his immense forces were\r\nshivered, and his triumphant eagles driven back with broken wing, he\r\nexclaimed, in that remarkable conversation recorded by his secretary,\r\nFain,--\"Well, this is War! High in the morning,--low enough at night!\r\nFrom a triumph to a fall is often but a step.\"[34] The same sentiment\r\nis repeated by the military historian of the Peninsular campaigns, when\r\nhe says, \"_Fortune_ always asserts her supremacy in war; and often from\r\na slight mistake such disastrous consequences flow, that, in every age\r\nand every nation, the _uncertainty_ of arms has been proverbial.\"[35]\r\nAnd again, in another place, considering the conduct of Wellington, the\r\nsame military historian, who is an unquestionable authority, confesses,\r\n\"A few hours' delay, an accident, a turn of fortune, and he would have\r\nbeen foiled. Ay! but this is War, _always dangerous and uncertain_, an\r\never-rolling wheel, and armed with scythes.\"[36] And will intelligent\r\nman look for justice to an ever-rolling wheel armed with scythes?\r\n\r\n    [33] Alison, Ch. 67, Vol. VIII. p. 815.\r\n\r\n    [34] Alison, Ch. 72, Vol. IX. p. 497.\r\n\r\n    [35] Napier, Book XXIV. ch. 6, Vol. VI. p. 687.\r\n\r\n    [36] Ibid., Book XVI. ch. 7, Vol. IV. p. 476.\r\n\r\nChance is written on every battle-field. Discerned less in the conflict\r\nof large masses than in that of individuals, it is equally present in\r\nboth. How capriciously the wheel turned when the fortunes of Rome were\r\nstaked on the combat between the Horatii and Curiatii!--and who, at one\r\ntime, augured that the single Horatius, with two slain brothers on the\r\nfield, would overpower the three living enemies? But this is not alone.\r\nIn all the combats of history, involving the fate of individuals or\r\nnations, we learn to revolt at the frenzy which carries questions of\r\nproperty, freedom, or life to a judgment so uncertain and senseless.\r\nThe humorous poet fitly exposes its hazards, when he says,--\r\n\r\n    \"that a turnstile is more certain\r\n     Than, in events of war, Dame Fortune.\"[37]\r\n\r\n    [37] Hudibras, Part I. Canto 3, vv. 23, 24.\r\n\r\nDuring the early modern centuries, and especially in the moral night of\r\nthe Dark Ages, the practice prevailed extensively throughout Europe of\r\ninvoking this adjudication for controversies, whether of individuals\r\nor communities. I do not dwell on the custom of Private War, though it\r\naptly illustrates the subject, stopping merely to echo that joy which,\r\nin a time of ignorance, before this arbitrament yielded gradually to\r\nthe ordinances of monarchs and an advancing civilization, hailed its\r\ntemporary suspension as _The Truce of God_. But this beautiful term,\r\nmost suggestive, and historically important, cannot pass without the\r\nattention which belongs to it. Such a truce is still an example, and\r\nalso an argument; but it is for nations. Here is something to be\r\nimitated; and here also is an appeal to the reason. If individuals\r\nor communities once recognized the Truce of God, why not again? And\r\nwhy may not its benediction descend upon nations also? Its origin\r\ngoes back to the darkest night. It was in 1032 that the Bishop of\r\nAquitaine announced the appearance of an angel with a message from\r\nHeaven, engaging men to cease from war and be reconciled. The people,\r\nalready softened by calamity and disposed to supernatural impressions,\r\nhearkened to the sublime message, and consented. From sunset Thursday\r\nto sunrise Monday each week, also during Advent and Lent, and at the\r\ngreat festivals, all effusion of blood was interdicted, and no man\r\ncould molest his adversary. Women, children, travellers, merchants,\r\nlaborers, were assured perpetual peace. Every church was made an\r\nasylum, and, by happy association, the plough also sheltered from\r\nperil all who came to it. This respite, justly regarded as marvellous,\r\nwas hailed as the Truce of God. Beginning in one neighborhood, it was\r\npiously extended until it embraced the whole kingdom, and then, by the\r\nauthority of the Pope, became coextensive with Christendom, while those\r\nwho violated it were put under solemn ban. As these things passed,\r\nbishops lifted their crosses, and the people in their gladness cried,\r\n_Peace! Peace!_[38] Originally too limited in operation and too short\r\nin duration, the Truce of God must again be proclaimed for all places\r\nand all times,--proclaimed to all mankind and all nations, without\r\ndistinction of person or calling, on all days of the week, without\r\ndistinction of sacred days or festivals, and with one universal asylum,\r\nnot merely the church and the plough, but every place and thing.\r\n\r\n    [38] Robertson, Hist. of Charles V., Vol. I. note 21. Semichon, La Paix\r\net la Trève de Dieu, Tom. II. pp. 35, 53.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Private Wars, whose best lesson is the Truce of God, by which for\r\na time they were hushed, I come to the _Judicial Combat_, or Trial by\r\nBattle, where, as in a mirror, we behold the barbarism of War, without\r\ntruce of any kind. Trial by Battle was a formal and legitimate mode of\r\ndeciding controversies, principally between individuals. Like other\r\nordeals, by walking barefoot and blindfold among burning ploughshares,\r\nby holding hot iron, by dipping the hand in hot water or hot oil,\r\nand like the great Ordeal of War, it was a presumptuous appeal to\r\nProvidence, under the apprehension and hope that Heaven would give the\r\nvictory to him who had the right. Its object was the very object of\r\nWar,--_the determination of Justice_. It was sanctioned by Municipal\r\nLaw as an arbitrament for individuals, as War, to the scandal of\r\ncivilization is still sanctioned by International Law as an arbitrament\r\nfor nations. \"Men,\" says the brilliant Frenchman, Montesquieu, \"subject\r\neven their prejudices to rules\"; and Trial by Battle, which he does\r\nnot hesitate to denounce as a \"monstrous usage,\" was surrounded\r\nby artificial regulations of multifarious detail, constituting an\r\nextensive system, determining how and when it should be waged, as War\r\nis surrounded by a complex code, known as the Laws of War. \"Nothing,\"\r\nsays Montesquieu again, \"could be more contrary to good sense, but,\r\nonce established, it was executed with a certain prudence,\"--which\r\nis equally true of War. No battle-field for an army is selected with\r\nmore care than was the field for Trial by Battle. An open space in the\r\nneighborhood of a church was often reserved for this purpose. At the\r\nfamous Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in Paris, there was a tribune\r\nfor the judges, overlooking the adjoining meadow, which served for the\r\nfield.[39] The combat was inaugurated by a solemn mass, according to a\r\nform still preserved, _Missa pro Duello_, so that, in ceremonial and\r\nsanction, as in the field, the Church was constantly present. Champions\r\nwere hired, as soldiers now.[40]\r\n\r\n    [39] Sismondi, Hist. des Français, Part. V. ch. 9, Tom. X. p. 514.\r\n\r\n    [40] The pivotal character of Trial by Battle, as an illustration of\r\nWar, will justify a reference to the modern authorities, among which\r\nare Robertson, who treats it with perspicuity and fulness (History of\r\nCharles V., Vol. I. note 22),--Hallam, always instructive (Middle Ages,\r\nVol. I. Chap. II. pt. 2),--Blackstone, always clear (Commentaries,\r\nBook III. ch. 22, sec. 5, and Book IV. ch. 27, sec. 3),--Montesquieu,\r\nwho casts upon it a flood of light (Esprit des Lois, Liv. XXVIII. ch.\r\n18-33),--Sismondi, humane and interesting (Histoire des Français, Part.\r\nIV. ch. 11, Tom. VIII. pp. 72-78),--Guizot, in a work of remarkable\r\nhistoric beauty, more grave than Montesquieu, and enlightened by\r\na better philosophy (Histoire de la Civilisation en France depuis\r\nla Chute de l'Empire Romain, Tom. IV. pp. 89, 149-166),--Wheaton,\r\nour learned countryman (History of the Northmen, Chap. III. and\r\nXII.),--also the two volumes of Millingen's History of Duelling, if so\r\nloose a compend deserves a place in this list. All these, describing\r\nTrial by Battle, testify against War. I cannot conceal that so great an\r\nauthority as Selden, a most enlightened jurist of the Long Parliament,\r\nargues the lawfulness of the Duel from the lawfulness of War. After\r\nsetting forth that \"a duel may be granted in some cases by the law of\r\nEngland,\" he asks, \"But whether is this lawful?\" and then answers,\r\n\"_If you grant any war lawful_, I make no doubt but to convince it.\"\r\n(Table-Talk: _Duel_.) But if the Duel be unlawful, how then with War?\r\n\r\nNo question was too sacred, grave, or recondite for this tribunal. In\r\nFrance, the title of an Abbey to a neighboring church was decided by\r\nit; and an Emperor of Germany, according to a faithful ecclesiastic,\r\n\"desirous of dealing _honorably_ with his people and nobles\" (mark here\r\nthe standard of honor!), waived the judgment of the court on a grave\r\nquestion of law concerning the descent of property, and referred it to\r\nchampions. Human folly did not stop here. In Spain, a subtile point\r\nof theology was submitted to the same determination.[41] But Trial by\r\nBattle was not confined to particular countries or to rare occasions.\r\nIt prevailed everywhere in Europe, superseding in many places all other\r\nordeals, and even _Trials by Proofs_, while it extended not only to\r\ncriminal matters, but to questions of property. In Orléans it had an\r\nexceptional limitation, being denied in civil matters where the amount\r\ndid not exceed five sous.[42]\r\n\r\n    [41] Robertson, Hist. Charles V., Vol. I. note 22.\r\n\r\n    [42] Montesquieu, Esprit des Lois, Liv. XXVIII. ch. 19.\r\n\r\nLike War in our day, its justice and fitness as an arbitrament were\r\nearly doubted or condemned. Liutprand, a king of the Lombards, during\r\nthat middle period neither ancient nor modern, in a law bearing date\r\nA.D. 724, declares his distrust of it as a mode of determining\r\njustice; but the monarch is compelled to add, that, considering the\r\n_custom_ of his Lombard people, he cannot forbid the _impious law_.\r\nHis words deserve emphatic mention: \"_Propter consuetudinem gentis\r\nnostræ Langobardorum_ LEGEM IMPIAM _vetare non possumus_ ...\"[43]\r\nThe appropriate epithet by which he branded Trial by Battle is the\r\nimportant bequest of the royal Lombard to a distant posterity. For this\r\nthe lawgiver will be cherished with grateful regard in the annals of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n    [43] Liutprandi Leges, Lib. VI. cap. 65: Muratori, Rerum Italic.\r\nScript., Tom. I. pars 2, p. 74.\r\n\r\nThis custom received another blow from Rome. In the latter part of the\r\nthirteenth century, Don Pedro of Aragon, after exchanging letters of\r\ndefiance with Charles of Anjou, proposed a personal combat, which was\r\naccepted, on condition that Sicily should be the prize of success.\r\nEach called down upon himself all the vengeance of Heaven, and the\r\nlast dishonor, if, at the appointed time, he failed to appear before\r\nthe Seneschal of Aquitaine, or, in case of defeat, refused to consign\r\nSicily undisturbed to the victor. While they were preparing for the\r\nlists, the Pope, Martin the Fourth, protested with all his might\r\nagainst this new Trial by Battle, which staked the sovereignty of a\r\nkingdom, a feudatory of the Holy See, on a wild stroke of chance. By\r\na papal bull, dated at Civita Vecchia, April 5th, 1283, he threatened\r\nexcommunication to either of the princes who should proceed to a combat\r\nwhich he pronounced _criminal_ and _abominable_. By a letter of the\r\nsame date, the Pope announced to Edward the First of England, Duke of\r\nAquitaine, the agreement of the two princes, which he most earnestly\r\ndeclared to be full of indecency and rashness, hostile to the concord\r\nof Christendom, and reckless of Christian blood; and he urged upon the\r\nEnglish monarch all possible effort to prevent the combat,--menacing\r\nhim with excommunication, and his territories with interdict, if it\r\nshould take place. Edward refusing to guaranty the safety of the\r\ncombatants in Aquitaine, the parties retired without consummating\r\ntheir duel.[44] The judgment of the Holy See, which thus accomplished\r\nits immediate object, though not in terms directed to the suppression\r\nof the _custom_, remains, nevertheless, from its peculiar energy, a\r\nperpetual testimony against Trial by Battle.\r\n\r\n    [44] Sismondi, Hist. des Français, Part. IV. ch. 15, Tom. VIII. pp.\r\n338-347.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo a monarch of France belongs the honor of first interposing the royal\r\nauthority for the entire suppression within his jurisdiction of this\r\n_impious custom_, so universally adopted, so dear to the nobility, and\r\nso profoundly rooted in the institutions of the Feudal Age. And here\r\nlet me pause with reverence as I pronounce the name of St. Louis, a\r\nprince whose unenlightened errors may find easy condemnation in an age\r\nof larger toleration and wider knowledge, but whose firm and upright\r\nsoul, exalted sense of justice, fatherly regard for the happiness\r\nof his people, respect for the rights of others, conscience void of\r\noffence toward God or man, make him foremost among Christian rulers,\r\nand the highest example for Christian prince or Christian people,--in\r\none word, a model of True Greatness. He was of angelic conscience,\r\nsubjecting whatever he did to the single and exclusive test of moral\r\nrectitude, disregarding every consideration of worldly advantage, all\r\nfear of worldly consequences.\r\n\r\nHis soul, thus tremblingly sensitive to right, was shocked at the\r\njudicial combat. It was a sin, in his sight, thus to _tempt God_, by\r\ndemanding of him a miracle, whenever judgment was pronounced. From\r\nthese intimate convictions sprang a royal ordinance, promulgated\r\nfirst at a Parliament assembled in 1260: \"_We forbid to all persons\r\nthroughout our dominions the_ TRIAL BY BATTLE; ... _and instead of\r\nbattles, we establish proofs by witnesses_.... AND THESE BATTLES WE\r\nABOLISH IN OUR DOMINIONS FOREVER.\"[45]\r\n\r\n    [45] Guizot, Hist. de la Civilisation en France, Leçon 14, Vol. IV. pp.\r\n162-164.\r\n\r\nSuch were the restraints on the royal authority, that this beneficent\r\nordinance was confined in operation to the demesnes of the king, not\r\nembracing those of the barons and feudatories. But where the power of\r\nthe sovereign did not reach, there he labored by example, influence,\r\nand express intercession,--treating with the great vassals, and\r\ninducing many to renounce this unnatural usage. Though for years later\r\nit continued to vex parts of France, its overthrow commenced with the\r\nOrdinance of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nHonor and blessings attend this truly Christian king, who submitted\r\nall his actions to the Heaven-descended sentiment of Duty,--who began\r\na long and illustrious reign by renouncing and restoring conquests\r\nof his predecessor, saying to those about him, whose souls did not\r\nascend to his heights, \"I know that the predecessors of the King of\r\nEngland lost altogether by right the conquest which I hold; and the\r\nland which I give him I do not give because I am bound to him or his\r\nheirs, _but to put love between my children and his children, who are\r\ncousins-german_; and it seems to me that what I thus give I employ\r\nto good purpose.\"[46] Honor to him who never by force or cunning\r\ngrasped what was not his own,--who sought no advantage from the turmoil\r\nand dissension of his neighbors,--who, first of Christian princes,\r\nrebuked the Spirit of War, saying to those who would have him profit\r\nby the strifes of others, \"Blessed are the peacemakers,\"[47]--who,\r\nby an immortal ordinance, abolished Trial by Battle throughout his\r\ndominions,--who extended equal justice to all, whether his own people\r\nor his neighbors, and in the extremity of his last illness, before the\r\nwalls of Tunis, under a burning African sun, among the bequests of his\r\nspirit, enjoined on his son and successor, \"in maintaining justice, to\r\nbe inflexible and loyal, turning neither to the right hand nor to the\r\nleft.\"[48]\r\n\r\n    [46] Guizot, Hist. de la Civilisation en France, Leçon 14, Vol. IV. p.\r\n151.\r\n\r\n    [47] \"_Benoist soient tuit li apaiseur._\"--Joinville, p. 143.\r\n\r\n    [48] Sismondi, Hist. des Français, Part. IV. ch. 12, Tom. VIII. p. 196.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo condemn Trial by Battle no longer requires the sagacity above his\r\nage of the Lombard monarch, or the intrepid judgment of the Sovereign\r\nPontiff, or the ecstatic soul of St. Louis. An incident of history,\r\nas curious as it is authentic, illustrates this point, and shows the\r\ncertain progress of opinion; and this brings me to England, where this\r\ntrial was an undoubted part of the early Common Law, with peculiar\r\nceremonies sanctioned by the judges robed in scarlet. The learned\r\nSelden, not content with tracing its origin, and exhibiting its forms,\r\nwith the oath of the duellist, \"As God me help, and his saints of\r\nParadise,\" shows also the copartnership of the Church through its\r\nliturgy appointing prayers for the occasion.[49] For some time it\r\nwas the only mode of trying a writ of right, by which the title to\r\nreal property was determined, and the fines from the numerous cases\r\nformed no inconsiderable portion of the King's revenue.[50] It was\r\npartially restrained by Henry the Second, under the advice of his\r\nchief justiciary, the ancient law-writer, Glanville, substituting the\r\nGrand Assize as an alternative, on the trial of a writ of right; and\r\nthe reason assigned for this substitution was the uncertainty of the\r\nDuel, so that after many and long delays justice was scarcely obtained,\r\nin contrast with the other trial, which was more convenient and\r\nswift.[51] At a later day, Trial by Battle was rebuked by Elizabeth,\r\nwho interposed to compel the parties to a composition,--although, for\r\nthe sake of their _honor_, as it was called, the lists were marked\r\nout and all the preliminary forms observed with much ceremony.[52] It\r\nwas awarded under Charles the First, and the proceeding went so far\r\nthat a day was proclaimed for the combatants to appear with spear,\r\nlong sword, short sword, and dagger, when the duel was adjourned from\r\ntime to time, and at last the king compelled an accommodation without\r\nbloodshed.[53] Though fallen into desuetude, quietly overruled by the\r\nenlightened sense of successive generations, yet, to the disgrace of\r\nEnglish jurisprudence, it was not legislatively abolished till near\r\nour own day,--as late as 1819,--the right to it having been openly\r\nclaimed in Westminster Hall only two years previous. An ignorant man,\r\ncharged with murder,--whose name, Abraham Thornton, is necessarily\r\nconnected with the history of this monstrous usage,--being proceeded\r\nagainst by the ancient process of appeal, pleaded, when brought into\r\ncourt, as follows: \"Not guilty; and I am ready to defend the same by\r\nmy body\": and thereupon taking off his glove, he threw it upon the\r\nfloor. The appellant, not choosing to accept this challenge, abandoned\r\nhis proceedings. The bench, the bar, and the whole kingdom were\r\nstartled by the infamy; and at the next session of Parliament Trial\r\nby Battle was abolished in England. In the debate on this subject,\r\nthe Attorney-General remarked, in appropriate terms, that, \"if the\r\nappellant had persevered in the Trial by Battle, he had no doubt\r\nthe legislature would have felt it their imperious duty at once to\r\ninterfere, and pass _an ex post facto law to prevent so degrading a\r\nspectacle from taking place_.\"[54]\r\n\r\n    [49] Selden, The Duello, or Single Combat, from Antiquity derived into\r\nthis Kingdom of England; also, Table Talk, _Duel_: Works, Vol. III.\r\ncol. 49-84, 2027.\r\n\r\n    [50] Madox, Hist. of Exchequer, Vol. I. p. 349.\r\n\r\n    [51] \"Est autem magna Assisa regale quoddam beneficium, ... quo vitæ\r\nhominum et status integritati tam salubriter consulitur, ut in jure\r\nquod quis in libero soli tenemento possidet retinendo, duelli casum\r\ndeclinare possunt homines ambiguum.... Jus enim, _quod post mullas et\r\nlongas dilationes vix evincitur per duellum_, per beneficium istius\r\nconstitutionis commodius et acceleratius expeditur.\" (Glanville,\r\nTractatus de Legibus et Consuetudinibus Regni Angliæ, Lib. II. cap. 7.)\r\nThese pointed words are precisely applicable to our Arbitrament of War,\r\nwith its many and long delays, so little productive of justice.\r\n\r\n    [52] Robertson, Hist. Charles V., Vol. I. note 22.\r\n\r\n    [53] Proceedings in the Court of Chivalry, on an Appeal of High\r\nTreason by Donald Lord Rea against Mr. David Ramsay, 7 Cha.

Blackstone, Com., III. 337:\r\nChitty's note.\r\n\r\nThese words evince the disgust which Trial by Battle excites in our\r\nday. Its folly and wickedness are conspicuous to all. Reverting to\r\nthat early period in which it prevailed, our minds are impressed by\r\nthe general barbarism; we recoil with horror from the awful subjection\r\nof justice to brute force,--from the impious profanation of God in\r\ndeeming him present at these outrages,--from the moral degradation\r\nout of which they sprang, and which they perpetuated; we enrobe\r\nourselves in self-complacent virtue, and thank God that we are not as\r\nthese men,--that ours is an age of light, while theirs was an age of\r\ndarkness!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut remember, fellow-citizens, that this criminal and impious custom,\r\nwhich all condemn in the case of individuals, is openly avowed by our\r\nown country, and by other countries of the great Christian Federation,\r\nnay, that it is expressly _established_ by International Law, as the\r\nproper mode of determining _justice_ between nations,--while the feats\r\nof hardihood by which it is waged, and the triumphs of its fields, are\r\nexalted beyond all other labors, whether of learning, industry, or\r\nbenevolence, as the well-spring of Glory. Alas! upon our own heads be\r\nthe judgment of barbarism which we pronounce upon those that have gone\r\nbefore! At this moment, in this period of light, while to the contented\r\nsouls of many the noonday sun of civilization seems to be standing\r\nstill in the heavens, as upon Gideon, the dealings between nations\r\nare still governed by the odious rules of brute violence which once\r\npredominated between individuals. The Dark Ages have not passed away;\r\nErebus and black Night, born of Chaos, still brood over the earth; nor\r\ncan we hail the clear day, until the hearts of nations are touched, as\r\nthe hearts of individual men, and all acknowledge _one and the same Law\r\nof Right_.\r\n\r\nWhat has taught you, O man! thus to find glory in an act, performed by\r\na nation, which you condemn as a crime or a barbarism, when committed\r\nby an individual? In what vain conceit of wisdom and virtue do you\r\nfind this incongruous morality? Where is it declared that God, who\r\nis no respecter of persons, is a respecter of multitudes? Whence do\r\nyou draw these partial laws of an impartial God? Man is immortal;\r\nbut Nations are mortal. Man has a higher destiny than Nations. Can\r\nNations be less amenable to the supreme moral law? Each individual is\r\nan atom of the mass. Must not the mass, in its conscience, be like\r\nthe individuals of which it is composed? Shall the mass, in relations\r\nwith other masses, do what individuals in relations with each other\r\nmay not do? As in the physical creation, so in the moral, there is but\r\none rule for the individual and the mass. It was the lofty discovery\r\nof Newton, that the simple law which determines the fall of an apple\r\nprevails everywhere throughout the Universe,--ruling each particle in\r\nreference to every other particle, large or small,--reaching from earth\r\nto heaven, and controlling the infinite motions of the spheres. So,\r\nwith equal scope, another simple law, _the Law of Right_, which binds\r\nthe individual, binds also two or three when gathered together,--binds\r\nconventions and congregations of men,--binds villages, towns, and\r\ncities,--binds states, nations, and races,--clasps the whole human\r\nfamily in its sevenfold embrace; nay, more, beyond\r\n\r\n    \"the flaming bounds of place and time,\r\n     The living throne, the sapphire blaze,\"\r\n\r\nit binds the angels of Heaven, Cherubim, full of knowledge, Seraphim,\r\nfull of love; above all, it binds, in self-imposed bonds, a just and\r\nomnipotent God. This is the law of which the ancient poet sings, as\r\n_Queen alike of mortals and immortals_. It is of this, and not of any\r\nearthly law, that Hooker speaks in that magnificent period which\r\nsounds like an anthem: \"Of Law there can be no less acknowledged\r\nthan that her seat is the bosom of God, her voice the harmony of the\r\nworld: all things in heaven and earth do her homage, the very least as\r\nfeeling her care, and the greatest as not exempted from her power: both\r\nangels and men, and creatures of what condition soever, though each\r\nin different sort and manner, yet all with uniform consent, admiring\r\nher as the mother of their peace and joy.\" Often quoted, and justly\r\nadmired, sometimes as the finest sentence of our English speech, this\r\ngrand declaration cannot be more fitly invoked than to condemn the\r\npretence of one law for the individual and another for the nation.\r\n\r\nStripped of all delusive apology, and tried by that comprehensive\r\nlaw under which nations are set to the bar like common men, War\r\nfalls from glory into barbarous guilt, taking its place among bloody\r\ntransgressions, while its flaming honors are turned into shame.\r\nPainful to existing prejudice as this may be, we must learn to abhor\r\nit, as we abhor similar transgressions by vulgar offender. Every word\r\nof reprobation which the enlightened conscience now fastens upon the\r\nsavage combatant in Trial by Battle, or which it applies to the unhappy\r\nbeing who in murderous duel takes the life of his fellow-man, belongs\r\nalso to the nation that appeals to War. Amidst the thunders of Sinai\r\nGod declared, \"Thou shalt not kill\"; and the voice of these thunders,\r\nwith this commandment, is prolonged to our own day in the echoes of\r\nChristian churches. What mortal shall restrict the application of these\r\nwords? Who on earth is empowered to vary or abridge the commandments of\r\nGod? Who shall presume to declare that this injunction was directed,\r\nnot to nations, but to individuals only,--not to many, but to one\r\nonly,--that one man shall not kill, but that many may,--that one man\r\nshall not slay in Duel, but that a nation may slay a multitude in the\r\nduel of War,--that each individual is forbidden to destroy the life\r\nof a single human being, but that a nation is not forbidden to cut\r\noff by the sword a whole people? We are struck with horror, and our\r\nhair stands on end, at the report of a single murder; we think of the\r\nsoul hurried to final account; we hunt the murderer; and Government\r\nputs forth its energies to secure his punishment. Viewed in the\r\nunclouded light of Truth, what is War but organized murder,--murder\r\nof malice aforethought,--in cold blood,--under sanctions of _impious\r\nlaw_,--through the operation of an extensive machinery of crime,--with\r\ninnumerable hands,--at incalculable cost of money,--by subtle\r\ncontrivances of cunning and skill,--or amidst the fiendish atrocities\r\nof the savage, brutal assault?\r\n\r\nBy another commandment, not less solemn, it is declared, \"Thou shalt\r\nnot steal\"; and then again there is another forbidding to covet what\r\nbelongs to others: but all this is done by War, which is stealing and\r\ncovetousness organized by International Law. The Scythian, undisturbed\r\nby the illusion of military glory, snatched a phrase of justice from an\r\nacknowledged criminal, when he called Alexander \"the greatest robber\r\nin the world.\" And the Roman satirist, filled with similar truth, in\r\npungent words touched to the quick that flagrant, unblushing injustice\r\nwhich dooms to condign punishment the very guilt that in another sphere\r\nand on a grander scale is hailed with acclamation:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ille crucem sceleris pretium tulit, his diadema.\"[55]\r\n\r\n    [55] Juvenal, Sat. XIII. 105. The same judgment is pronounced by\r\nFénelon in his counsels to royalty, entitled, _Examen de Conscience\r\nsur les Devoirs de la Royauté_.\r\n\r\nWhile condemning the ordinary malefactor, mankind, blind to the real\r\ncharacter of War, may yet a little longer crown the giant actor with\r\nglory; a generous posterity may pardon to unconscious barbarism the\r\natrocities which have been waged; but the _custom_, as organized\r\nby existing law, cannot escape the unerring judgment of reason and\r\nreligion. The outrages, which, under most solemn sanctions, it permits\r\nand invokes for professed purposes of justice, cannot be authorized by\r\nany human power; and they must rise in overwhelming judgment, not only\r\nagainst those who wield the weapons of Battle, but more still against\r\nall who uphold its monstrous Arbitrament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen, O, when shall the St. Louis of the Nations arise,--Christian\r\nruler or Christian people,--who, in the Spirit of True Greatness,\r\nshall proclaim, that hence-forward forever the great Trial by Battle\r\nshall cease,--that \"these battles\" shall be _abolished_ throughout\r\nthe Commonwealth of Civilization,--that _a spectacle so degrading_\r\nshall never be allowed again to take place,--and that it is the duty\r\nof nations, involving the highest and wisest policy, to establish\r\nlove between each other, and, in all respects, at all times, with all\r\npersons, whether their own people or the people of other lands, to be\r\ngoverned by the sacred _Law of Right_, as between man and man?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\nI am now brought to review the obstacles encountered by those who,\r\naccording to the injunction of St. Augustine, would _make war on War_,\r\nand slay it with the word. To some of these obstacles I alluded at the\r\nbeginning, especially the warlike literature, by which the character is\r\nformed. The world has supped so full with battles, that its modes of\r\nthought and many of its rules of conduct are incarnadined with blood,\r\nas the bones of swine, feeding on madder, are said to become red. Not\r\nto be tempted by this theme, I hasten on to expose in succession those\r\nvarious PREJUDICES so powerful still in keeping alive the _custom_ of\r\nWar, including that greatest prejudice, mighty parent of an infinite\r\nbrood, at whose unreasoning behest untold sums are absorbed in\r\nPreparations for War.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1. One of the most important is the prejudice from _belief in its\r\nnecessity_. When War is called a necessity, it is meant, of course,\r\nthat its object can be attained in no other way. Now I think it has\r\nalready appeared, with distinctness approaching demonstration, that\r\nthe professed object of War, which is justice between nations, is in\r\nno respect promoted by War,--that force is not justice, nor in any\r\nway conducive to justice,--that the eagles of victory are the emblems\r\nof successful force only, and not of established right. Justice is\r\nobtained solely by the exercise of reason and judgment; but these\r\nare silent in the din of arms. Justice is without passion; but War\r\nlets loose all the worst passions, while \"Chance, high arbiter, more\r\nembroils the fray.\" The age is gone when a nation within the enchanted\r\ncircle of civilization could make war upon its neighbors for any\r\ndeclared purpose of booty or vengeance. It does \"nought in hate, but\r\nall in _honor_.\" Such is the present rule. Professions of tenderness\r\nmingle with the first mutterings of strife. As if conscience-struck\r\nat the criminal abyss into which they are plunging, each of the\r\ngreat litigants seeks to fix upon the other some charge of hostile\r\naggression, or to set up the excuse of defending some asserted right,\r\nsome Texas, some Oregon. Each, like Pontius Pilate, vainly washes its\r\nhands of innocent blood, and straightway allows a crime at which the\r\nwhole heavens are darkened, and two kindred countries are severed, as\r\nthe vail of the Temple was rent in twain.\r\n\r\nProper modes for the determination of international disputes are\r\nNegotiation, Mediation, Arbitration, and a Congress of Nations,--all\r\npracticable, and calculated to secure peaceful justice. Under existing\r\nLaw of Nations these may be employed at any time. _But the very law\r\nsanctioning War may be changed_, as regards two or more nations by\r\ntreaty between them, and as regards the body of nations by general\r\nconsent. If nations can agree in solemn provisions of International Law\r\nto establish War as Arbiter of Justice, they can also agree to abolish\r\nthis arbitrament, and to establish peaceful substitutes,--precisely\r\nas similar substitutes are established by Municipal Law to determine\r\ncontroversies among individuals. A system of Arbitration may be\r\ninstituted, or a Congress of Nations, charged with the high duty of\r\norganizing an _Ultimate Tribunal_, instead of \"these battles.\" To do\r\nthis, the will only is required.\r\n\r\nLet it not be said, then, that war is a _necessity_; and may our\r\ncountry aspire to the glory of taking the lead in disowning the\r\nbarbarous system of LYNCH LAW among nations, while it proclaims\r\npeaceful _substitutes_! Such a glory, unlike the earthly fame of\r\nbattle, will be immortal as the stars, dropping perpetual light upon\r\nthe souls of men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2. Another prejudice is founded on _the practice of nations_, past and\r\npresent. There is no crime or enormity in morals which may not find\r\nthe support of human example, often on an extended scale. But it will\r\nnot be urged in our day that we are to look for a standard of duty\r\nin the conduct of vain, fallible, mistaken man. Not by any subtile\r\nalchemy can man transmute Wrong into Right. Because War is according\r\nto the practice of the world, it does not follow that it is right.\r\nFor ages the world worshipped false gods,--not less false because all\r\nbowed before them. At this moment the prevailing numbers of mankind\r\nare heathen; but heathenism is not therefore true. Once it was the\r\npractice of nations to slaughter prisoners of war; but the Spirit of\r\nWar recoils now from this bloody sacrifice. By a perverse morality\r\nin Sparta, theft, instead of being a crime, was, like War, dignified\r\ninto an art and accomplishment; like War, it was admitted into the\r\nsystem of youthful education; and, like War, it was illustrated by an\r\ninstance of unconquerable firmness, barbaric counterfeit of virtue. The\r\nSpartan youth, with the stolen fox beneath his robe eating into his\r\nbowels, is an example of fortitude not unlike that so often admired\r\nin the soldier. Other illustrations crowd upon the mind; but I will\r\nnot dwell upon them. We turn with disgust from Spartan cruelty and\r\nthe wolves of Taygetus,--from the awful cannibalism of the Feejee\r\nIslands,--from the profane rites of innumerable savages,--from the\r\ncrushing Juggernaut,--from the Hindoo widow on her funeral pyre,--from\r\nthe Indian dancing at the stake; but had not all these, like War, the\r\nsanction of established usage?\r\n\r\nOften is it said that we need not be wiser than our fathers. Rather\r\nstrive to excel our fathers. What in them was good imitate; but do not\r\nbind ourselves, as in chains of Fate, by their imperfect example. In\r\nall modesty be it said, we have lived to little purpose, if we are not\r\nwiser than the generations that have gone before. It is the exalted\r\ndistinction of man that he is progressive,--that his reason is not\r\nmerely the reason of a single human being, but that of the whole human\r\nrace, in all ages from which knowledge has descended, in all lands\r\nfrom which it has been borne away. We are the heirs to an inheritance\r\ngrandly accumulating from generation to generation, with the superadded\r\nproducts of other lands. The child at his mother's knee is now taught\r\nthe orbits of the heavenly bodies,\r\n\r\n    \"Where worlds on worlds compose one Universe,\"\r\n\r\nthe nature of this globe, the character of the tribes by which it is\r\ncovered, and the geography of countries, to an extent far beyond the\r\nken of the most learned in other days. It is true, therefore, that\r\nantiquity is the real infancy of man. Then is he immature, ignorant,\r\nwayward, selfish, childish, finding his chief happiness in lowest\r\npleasures, unconscious of the higher. The animal reigns supreme, and\r\nhe seeks contest, war, blood. Already he has lived through infancy and\r\nchildhood. Reason and the kindlier virtues, repudiating and abhorring\r\nforce, now bear sway. The time has come for temperance, moderation,\r\npeace. We are the true ancients. The single lock on the battered\r\nforehead of old Time is thinner now than when our fathers attempted\r\nto grasp it; the hour-glass has been turned often since; the scythe is\r\nheavier laden with the work of death.\r\n\r\nLet us not, then, take for a lamp to our feet the feeble taper that\r\nglimmers from the sepulchre of the Past. Rather hail that ever-burning\r\nlight above, in whose beams is the brightness of noonday.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n3. There is a topic which I approach with diffidence, but in the\r\nspirit of frankness. It is the influence which War, though condemned\r\nby Christ, has derived from the _Christian Church_. When Constantine,\r\non one of his marches, at the head of his army, beheld the luminous\r\ntrophy of the cross in the sky, right above the meridian sun, inscribed\r\nwith the words, _By this conquer_, had his soul been penetrated by the\r\ntrue spirit of Him whose precious symbol it was, he would have found\r\nno inspiration to the spear and the sword. He would have received the\r\nlesson of self-sacrifice as from the lips of the Saviour, and learned\r\nthat by no earthly weapon of battle can true victory be won. The pride\r\nof conquest would have been rebuked, and the bawble sceptre have fallen\r\nfrom his hands. _By this conquer_: by patience, suffering, forgiveness\r\nof evil, by all those virtues of which the cross is the affecting\r\ntoken, _conquer_, and the victory shall be greater than any in the\r\nannals of Roman conquest; it may not yet find a place in the records of\r\nman, but it will appear in the register of everlasting life.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Church, after the early centuries, failed to discern the\r\npeculiar spiritual beauty of the faith it professed. Like Constantine,\r\nit found new incentive to War in the religion of Peace; and such is its\r\ncharacter, even in our own day. The Pope of Rome, the asserted head of\r\nthe Church, Vicegerent of Christ upon earth, whose seal is a fisherman,\r\non whose banner is a Lamb before the Holy Cross, assumed the command\r\nof armies, mingling the thunders of Battle with the thunders of the\r\nVatican. The dagger projecting from the sacred vestments of De Retz,\r\nwhile still an archbishop, was justly derided by the Parisian crowd as\r\n\"the Archbishop's breviary.\" We read of mitred prelates in armor of\r\nproof, and seem still to catch the clink of the golden spurs of bishops\r\nin the streets of Cologne. The sword of knighthood was consecrated by\r\nthe Church, and priests were expert masters in military exercises. I\r\nhave seen at the gates of the Papal Palace in Rome a constant guard\r\nof Swiss soldiers; I have seen, too, in our own streets, a show as\r\nincongruous and inconsistent,--the pastor of a Christian church\r\nswelling the pomp of a military parade. And some have heard, within a\r\nfew short weeks, in a Christian pulpit, from the lips of an eminent\r\nChristian divine, a sermon, where we are encouraged to _serve the God\r\nof Battles, and, as citizen soldiers, fight for Peace_:[56] a sentiment\r\nin unhappy harmony with the profane language of the British peer, who,\r\nin addressing the House of Lords, said, \"_The best road to Peace,\r\nmy Lords, is War_, and that in the manner we are taught to worship\r\nour Creator, namely, by carrying it on with all our souls, with all\r\nour minds, with all our hearts, and with all our strength,\"[57]--but\r\nfinding small support in a religion that expressly enjoins, when one\r\ncheek is smitten, to turn the other, and which we hear with pain from\r\na minister of Christian truth,--alas! thus made inferior to that of the\r\nheathen who _preferred the unjustest peace to the justest war_.[58]\r\n\r\n    [56] Discourse before the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, by\r\nA.H. Vinton.\r\n\r\n    [57] Earl of Abingdon, May 30, 1794: Hansard, Parl. Hist., XXXI. 680.\r\n\r\n    [58] \"_Vel iniquissimam pacem justissimo bello anteferrem_\" are the\r\nwords of Cicero. (Epist. A. Cæcinæ: Epp. ad Diversos, VI. 6.) Only\r\neight days after Franklin had placed his name to the treaty of peace\r\nwhich acknowledged the independence of his country, he wrote to a\r\nfriend, \"May we never see another war! for, in my opinion, there never\r\nwas a good war or a bad peace.\" (Letter to Josiah Quincy: Works, ed.\r\nSparks, Vol. X. p. 11.) It is with sincere regret that I seem, by a\r\nparticular allusion, to depart for a moment from so great a theme; but\r\nthe person and the theme here become united. I cannot refrain from\r\nthe effort to tear this iron branch of War from the golden tree of\r\nChristian Truth, even though a voice come forth from the breaking bough.\r\n\r\nWell may we marvel that now, in an age of civilization, the God of\r\nBattles should be invoked. \"_Deo imperante_, QUEM ADESSE BELLANTIBUS\r\nCREDUNT,\" are the appropriate words of surprise in which Tacitus\r\ndescribes a similar delusion of the ancient Germans.[59] The polite\r\nRoman did not think God present with fighting men. This ancient\r\nsuperstition must have lost something of its hold even in Germany;\r\nfor, at a recent period, her most renowned captain,--whose false glory\r\nprocured for him the title of Great,--Frederick of Prussia, declared,\r\nwith commendable frankness, that he always found the God of Battles on\r\nthe side of the strongest regiments; and when it was proposed to place\r\non his banner, soon to flout the sky of Silesia, the inscription, _For_\r\nGOD _and Country_, he rejected the first word, declaring it not proper\r\nto introduce the name of the Deity in the quarrels of men. By this\r\nelevated sentiment the warrior monarch may be remembered, when his fame\r\nof battle has passed away.\r\n\r\n    [59] De Moribus German., Cap. 7.\r\n\r\nThe French priest of Mars, who proclaimed the \"divinity\" of War,\r\nrivals the ancient Germans in faith that God is the tutelary guardian\r\nof battle, and he finds a new title, which he says \"shines\" on all the\r\npages of Scripture, being none other than _God of Armies_.[60] Never\r\nwas greater mistake. No theology, no theodicy, has ever attributed\r\nto God this title. God is God of Heaven, God of Hosts, the Living\r\nGod, and he is God of Peace,--so called by St. Paul, saying, \"Now\r\nthe God of Peace be with you all,\"[61] and again, \"The God of Peace\r\nshall bruise Satan shortly,\"[62]--but God of Armies he is not, as he\r\nis not God of Battles.[63] The title, whether of Armies or of Hosts,\r\nthus invoked for War, has an opposite import, even angelic,--the\r\narmies named being simply, according to authorities Ecclesiastical\r\nand Rabbinical, the hosts of angels standing about the throne. Who,\r\nthen, is God of Battles? It is Mars,--man-slaying, blood-polluted,\r\ncity-smiting Mars![64] It is not He who binds the sweet influences of\r\nthe Pleiades and looses the bands of Orion, who causes the sun to shine\r\non the evil and the good, who distils the oil of gladness upon every\r\nupright heart, who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,--the Fountain of\r\nMercy and Goodness, the God of Justice and Love. Mars is not the God\r\nof Christians; he is not Our Father in Heaven; to him can ascend no\r\nprayers of Christian thanksgiving, no words of Christian worship, no\r\npealing anthem to swell the note of praise.\r\n\r\n    [60] Joseph de Maistre, Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg, Tom. II. p. 27.\r\n\r\n    [61] Romans, xv. 33.\r\n\r\n    [62] Ibid., xvi. 20.\r\n\r\n    [63] A volume so common as Cruden's Concordance shows the audacity of\r\nthe martial claim.\r\n\r\n    [64] Iliad, V. 31.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Christ and Mars are still brought into fellowship, even\r\ninterchanging pulpits. What a picture of contrasts! A national ship of\r\nthe line now floats in this harbor. Many of you have pressed its deck,\r\nand observed with admiration the completeness which prevails in all\r\nits parts,--its lithe masts and complex network of ropes,--its thick\r\nwooden walls, within which are more than the soldiers of Ulysses,--its\r\nstrong defences, and its numerous dread and rude-throated engines of\r\nWar. There, each Sabbath, amidst this armament of blood, while the\r\nwave comes gently plashing against the frowning sides, from a pulpit\r\nsupported by a cannon, in repose now, but ready to awake its dormant\r\nthunder charged with death, a Christian preacher addresses officers and\r\ncrew. May his instructions carry strength and succor to their souls!\r\nBut, in such a place, those highest words of the Master he professes,\r\n\"Blessed are the peacemakers,\" \"Love your enemies,\" \"Resist not evil,\"\r\nmust, like Macbeth's \"Amen,\" stick in the throat.\r\n\r\nIt will not be doubted that this strange and unblessed conjunction of\r\nthe Church with War has no little influence in blinding the world to\r\nthe truth, too slowly recognized, that the whole custom of war _is\r\ncontrary to Christianity_.\r\n\r\nIndividual interests mingle with prevailing errors, and are so far\r\nconcerned in maintaining them that military men yield reluctantly\r\nto this truth. Like lawyers, as described by Voltaire, they are\r\n\"conservators of ancient barbarous usages.\" But that these usages\r\nshould obtain countenance in the Church is one of those anomalies\r\nwhich make us feel the weakness of our nature, if not the elevation\r\nof Christian truth. To uphold the Arbitrament of War requires no more\r\nthan to uphold the Trial by Battle; for the two are identical, except\r\nin proportion. One is a giant, the other a pygmy. Long ago the Church\r\ncondemned the pygmy, and this Christian judgment now awaits extension\r\nto the giant. Meanwhile it is perpetual testimony; nor should it be\r\nforgotten, that, for some time after the Apostles, when the message\r\nof peace and good-will was first received, many yielded to it so\r\ncompletely as to reject arms of all kinds. Such was the voice of\r\nJustin Martyr, Irenæus, Tertullian, and Origen, while Augustine pleads\r\nalways for Peace. Gibbon coldly recounts, how Maximilian, a youthful\r\nrecruit from Africa, refused to serve, insisting that his conscience\r\nwould not permit him to embrace the profession of soldier, and then\r\nhow Marcellus the Centurion, on the day of a public festival, threw\r\naway his belt, his arms, and the ensigns of command, exclaiming with\r\na loud voice, that he would obey none but Jesus Christ, the Eternal\r\nKing.[65] Martyrdom ensued, and the Church has inscribed their names\r\non its everlasting rolls, thus forever commemorating their testimony.\r\nThese are early examples, not without successors. But Mars, so potent,\r\nespecially in Rome, was not easily dislodged, and down to this day\r\nholds his place at Christian altars.\r\n\r\n    \"Thee to defend the Moloch priest prefers\r\n     The prayer of hate, and bellows to the herd,\r\n     That Deity, accomplice Deity,\r\n     In the fierce jealousy of wakened wrath,\r\n     Will go forth with our armies and our fleets\r\n     To scatter the red ruin on their foes!\r\n     O, blasphemy! to mingle fiendish deeds\r\n     With blessedness!\"[66]\r\n\r\n    [65] Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chap. XVI. Vol. I.\r\np. 680.\r\n\r\n    [66] Coleridge, Religious Musings, written Christmas Eve, 1794.\r\n\r\nOne of the beautiful pictures adorning the dome of a church in Home,\r\nby that master of Art, whose immortal colors speak as with the voice\r\nof a poet, the Divine Raphael, represents Mars in the attitude of War,\r\nwith a drawn sword uplifted and ready to strike, while an unarmed angel\r\nfrom behind, with gentle, but irresistible force, arrests and holds the\r\ndescending hand. Such is the true image of Christian duty; nor can I\r\nreadily perceive any difference in principle between those ministers of\r\nthe Gospel who themselves gird on the sword, as in the olden time, and\r\nthose others, unarmed, and in customary suit of solemn black, who lend\r\nthe sanction of their presence to the martial array, or to any form of\r\npreparation for War. The drummer, who pleaded that he did not fight,\r\nwas held more responsible for the battle than the soldier,--as it was\r\nthe sound of his drum that inflamed the flagging courage of the troops.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n4. From prejudices engendered by the Church I pass to prejudices\r\nengendered by the army itself, having their immediate origin in\r\nmilitary life, but unfortunately diffusing themselves throughout the\r\ncommunity, in widening, though less apparent circles. I allude directly\r\nto what is called _the Point of Honor_, early child of Chivalry, living\r\nrepresentative of its barbarism.[67] It is difficult to define what\r\nis so evanescent, so impalpable, so chimerical, so unreal, and yet\r\nwhich exercises such fiendish power over many men, and controls the\r\nintercourse of nations. As a little water, fallen into the crevice\r\nof a rock, under the congelation of winter, swells till it bursts\r\nthe thick and stony fibres, so a word or slender act, dropping into\r\nthe heart of man, under the hardening influence of this pernicious\r\nsentiment, dilates till it rends in pieces the sacred depository of\r\nhuman affection, and the demons Hate and Strife are left to rage. The\r\nmusing Hamlet saw this sentiment in its strange and unnatural potency,\r\nwhen his soul pictured to his contemplations an\r\n\r\n    \"army of such mass and charge,\r\n     Led by a delicate and tender prince,...\r\n     Exposing what is mortal and unsure\r\n     To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\r\n    _Even for an egg-shell_\";\r\n\r\nand when, again, giving to the sentiment its strongest and most popular\r\nexpression, he exclaims,--\r\n\r\n    \"Rightly to be great\r\n     Is not to stir without great argument,\r\n    _But greatly to find quarrel in a straw,\r\n     When honor's at the stake_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    [67] The _Point of Honor_ has a literature of its own, illustrated by\r\nmany volumes, some idea of which may be obtained in Brunet, \"Manuel du\r\nLibraire,\" Tom. VI. col. 1636-1638, under the head of _Chevalerie au\r\nMoyen Age, comprenant les Tournois, les Combats Singuliers_, etc. One\r\nof these has a title much in advance of the age in which it appeared:\r\n\"Chrestienne Confutation du Point d'Honneur sur lequel la Noblesse\r\nfonde aujourd'hui ses Querelles et Monomachies,\" par Christ. de\r\nChiffontaine, Paris, 1579.\r\n\r\nAnd when is honor at stake? This inquiry opens again the argument with\r\nwhich I commenced, and with which I hope to close. Honor can be at\r\nstake only where justice and beneficence are at stake; it can never\r\ndepend on egg-shell or straw; it can never depend on any hasty word of\r\nanger or folly, not even if followed by vulgar violence. True honor\r\nappears in the dignity of the human soul, in that highest moral and\r\nintellectual excellence which is the nearest approach to qualities we\r\nreverence as attributes of God. Our community frowns with indignation\r\nupon the profaneness of the duel, having its rise in this irrational\r\n_point of_ _honor_. Are you aware that you indulge the same sentiment\r\non a gigantic scale, when you recognize this very point of honor as\r\na proper apology for War? We have already seen that justice is in no\r\nrespect promoted by War. Is True Honor promoted where justice is not?\r\n\r\nThe very word Honor, as used by the world, fails to express any\r\nelevated sentiment. How immeasurably below the sentiment of Duty!\r\nIt is a word of easy virtue, that has been prostituted to the most\r\nopposite characters and transactions. From the field of Pavia, where\r\nFrance suffered one of the worst reverses in her annals, the defeated\r\nking writes to his mother, \"All is lost, except _honor_.\" At a later\r\nday, the renowned French cook, Vatel, in a paroxysm of grief and\r\nmortification at the failure of two dishes for the table, exclaims, \"I\r\nhave lost my _honor_!\" and stabs himself to the heart.[68] Montesquieu,\r\nwhose writings are constellations of epigrams, calls honor a prejudice\r\nonly, which he places in direct contrast with virtue,--the former being\r\nthe animating principle of monarchy, and the latter the animating\r\nprinciple of a republic; but he reveals the inferiority of honor, as\r\na principle, when he adds, that, in a well-governed monarchy, almost\r\neverybody is a good citizen, while it is rare to meet a really good\r\nman.[69] The man of honor is not the man of virtue. By an instinct\r\npointing to the truth, we do not apply this term to the high columnar\r\nqualities which sustain and decorate life,--parental affection,\r\njustice, benevolence, the attributes of God. He would seem to borrow\r\na feebler phrase, showing a slight appreciation of the distinctive\r\ncharacter to whom reverence is accorded, who should speak of father,\r\nmother, judge, angel, or finally of God, as _persons of honor_. In such\r\nsacred connections, we feel, beyond the force of any argument, the\r\nmundane character of the sentiment which plays such a part in history\r\nand even in common life.\r\n\r\n    [68] The death of the culinary martyr is described by Madame de Sévigné\r\nwith the accustomed coldness and brilliancy of her fashionable pen\r\n(Lettres L. and LI., Tom. I. pp. 164, 165). It was attributed, she\r\nsays, _to the high sense of honor he had after his own way_. Tributes\r\nmultiply. A French vaudeville associates his name with that of this\r\nbrilliant writer, saying, \"Madame de Sévigné and Vatel are the people\r\nwho _honored_ the age of Louis XIV.\" The _Almanach des Gourmands_,\r\nin the Epistle Dedicatory of its concluding volume, addresses the\r\nvenerable shade of the heroic cook: \"You have proved that the\r\n_fanaticism of honor_ can exist in the kitchen as well as the camp.\"\r\nBerchoux commemorates the dying exclamation in _La Gastronomie_, Chant\r\nIII.:--\r\n\r\n\"_Je suis perdu d'honneur_, deux rôtis ont manqué.\"\r\n\r\n    [69] Esprit des Lois, Liv. III. ch. 3-7.\r\n\r\nThe rule of honor is founded in the imagined necessity of resenting by\r\nforce a supposed injury, whether of word or act.[70] Admit the injury\r\nreceived, seeming to sully the character; is it wiped away by any\r\nforce, and descent to the brutal level of its author? \"Could I wipe\r\nyour blood from my conscience as easily as this insult from my face,\"\r\nsaid a Marshal of France, greater on this occasion than on any field of\r\nfame, \"I would lay you dead at my feet.\" Plato, reporting the angelic\r\nwisdom of Socrates, declares, in one of those beautiful dialogues\r\nshining with stellar light across the ages, that _to do a wrong is\r\nmore shameful than to receive a wrong_.[71] And this benign sentiment\r\ncommends itself alike to the Christian, who is bid to render good for\r\nevil, and to the enlightened soul of man. But who confessing its truth\r\nwill resort to force on any point of _honor_?\r\n\r\n    [70] This is well exposed in a comedy of Molière.\r\n\r\n\"_Don Pedre._ Souhaitez-vous quelque chose de moi?\r\n\r\n\"_Hali._ Oui, un conseil sur _un fait d'honneur_. Je sais qu'en ces\r\nmatières il est mal-aisé de trouver un cavalier plus consommé que\r\nvous....\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, _j'ai reçu un soufflet_. Vous savez ce qu'est un soufflet,\r\nlorsqu'il se donne à main ouverte sur le beau milieu de la joue. _J'ai\r\nce soufflet fort sur le coeur; et je suis dans l'incertitude, si,\r\npour me venger de l'affront, je dois me battre avec mon homme, ou bien\r\nle faire assassiner._\r\n\r\n\"_Don Pedre._ Assassiner, c'est le plus sûr et le plus court chemin.\"\r\n\r\n _Le Sicilien_, Sc. XIII.\r\n\r\n    [71] This proposition is enforced by Socrates, with unanswerable\r\nreasoning and illustration, throughout the _Gorgias_, which Cicero read\r\ndiligently while studying at Athens (De Oratore, I. 11).\r\n\r\nIn ancient Athens, as in unchristianized Christian lands, there were\r\nsophists who urged that _to suffer_ was unbecoming a man, and would\r\ndraw down incalculable evil. The following passage, which I translate\r\nwith scrupulous literalness, will show the manner in which the moral\r\ncowardice of these persons of little faith was rebuked by him whom the\r\ngods of Greece pronounced Wisest of Men.\r\n\r\n\"These things being so, let us inquire what it is you reproach me\r\nwith: whether it is well said, or not, that I, forsooth, am not able\r\nto assist either myself or any of my friends or my relations, or to\r\nsave myself from the greatest dangers, but that, like the infamous, I\r\nam at the mercy of any one who may choose to smite me on the face (for\r\nthis was your juvenile expression), or take away my property, or drive\r\nme out of the city, or (the extreme case) kill me, and that to be so\r\nsituated is, as you say, the most shameful of all things. But my view\r\nis,--a view many times expressed already, but there is no objection\r\nto its being stated again,--_my view, I say, is, O Callicles, that to\r\nbe struck on the face unjustly is not most shameful, nor to have my\r\nbody mutilated, nor my purse cut; but that to strike and cut me and\r\nmine unjustly is more shameful and worse--and stealing, too,_ _and\r\nenslaving, and housebreaking, and, in general, doing any wrong whatever\r\nto me and mine, is more shameful and worse--for him who does the wrong\r\nthan for me who suffer it_. These things, which thus appeared to us in\r\nthe former part of this discussion, are secured and bound (even if the\r\nexpression be somewhat rustical) with iron and adamantine arguments, as\r\nindeed they would seem to be; and unless you, or some one stronger than\r\nyou, can break them, it is impossible for any one, saying otherwise\r\nthan as I now say, to speak correctly: since, for my part, _I always\r\nhave the same thing to say,--that I know not how these things are, but\r\nthat, of all whom I have ever discoursed with as now, no one is able to\r\nsay otherwise without being ridiculous_.\"[72]\r\n\r\n    [72] Gorgias, Cap. LXIV.\r\n\r\n    Such is the wisdom of Socrates, as reported by Plato; and it has\r\n    found beautiful expression in the verse of an English poet, who\r\n    says,--\r\n\r\n    \"Dear as freedom is, and in my heart's Just estimation prized above\r\n    all price, _I had much rather be myself the slave And wear the\r\n    bonds than fasten them on him_.\"[73]\r\n\r\n    [73] Cowper, The Task, Book II. vv. 33-36.\r\n\r\nThe modern _point of honor_ did not obtain a place in warlike\r\nantiquity. Themistocles at Salamis, when threatened with a blow, did\r\nnot send a cartel to the Spartan commander. \"Strike, but hear,\" was the\r\nresponse of that firm nature, which felt that true honor is gained only\r\nin the performance of duty. It was in the depths of modern barbarism,\r\nin the age of chivalry, that this sentiment shot up into wildest and\r\nrankest fancies. Not a step was taken without it. No act without\r\nreference to the \"bewitching duel.\" And every stage in the combat, from\r\nthe ceremonial at its beginning to its deadly close, was measured\r\nby this fantastic law. Nobody forgets _As You Like It_, with its\r\nhumorous picture of a quarrel in progress to a duel, through the seven\r\ndegrees of Touchstone. Nothing more ridiculous, as nothing can be more\r\ndisgusting, than the degradation in which this whole fantasy of honor\r\nhad its origin, as fully appears from an authentic incident in the life\r\nof its most brilliant representative. The Chevalier Bayard, cynosure\r\nof chivalry, the good knight without fear and without reproach,\r\nbattling with the Spaniard Señor Don Alonso de Soto Mayor, succeeded\r\nby a feint in striking him such a blow, that the weapon, despite the\r\ngorget, penetrated the throat four fingers deep. The wounded Spaniard\r\ngrappled with his antagonist until they both rolled on the ground, when\r\nBayard, drawing his dagger, and thrusting the point directly into the\r\nnostrils of his foe, exclaimed, \"Señor Don Alonso, surrender, or you\r\nare a dead man!\"--a speech which appeared superfluous, as the second\r\nof the Spaniard cried out, \"Señor Bayard, he is dead already; you\r\nhave conquered.\" The French knight \"would gladly have given a hundred\r\nthousand crowns, if he had had them, to have vanquished him alive,\"\r\nsays the Chronicle; but now falling upon his knees, he kissed the\r\nearth three times, then rose and drew his dead enemy from the field,\r\nsaying to the second, \"Señor Don Diego, have I done enough?\" To which\r\nthe other piteously replied, \"Too much, Señor Bayard, for the _honor_\r\nof Spain!\" when the latter very generously presented him with the\r\ncorpse, it being his right, by the Law of Honor, to dispose of it as\r\nhe thought proper: an act highly commended by the chivalrous Brantôme,\r\nwho thinks it difficult to say which did most _honor_ to the faultless\r\nknight,--not dragging the dead body by a leg ignominiously from the\r\nfield, like the carcass of a dog, or condescending to fight while\r\nsuffering under an ague![74]\r\n\r\n    [74] La Tresjoyeuse, Plaisante et Recreative Hystoire, composée par\r\nle Loyal Serviteur, des Faiz, Gestes, Triumphes et Prouesses du Bon\r\nChevalier sans Paour et sans Reprouche, le Gentil Seigneur de Bayart,\r\nChap. XXII.: Petitot, Collection Complète des Mémoires relatifs à\r\nl'Histoire de France, Tom. XV. pp. 238-244. Brantôme, Discours sur les\r\nDuels: OEuvres, Tom. VIII. pp. 34, 35.\r\n\r\nIn such a transaction, conferring honor upon the brightest son of\r\nchivalry, we learn the real character of an age whose departure has\r\nbeen lamented with such touching, but inappropriate eloquence. Thank\r\nGod! the age of chivalry is gone; but it cannot be allowed to prolong\r\nits fanaticism of honor into our day. This must remain with the lances,\r\nswords, and daggers by which it was guarded, or appear, if it insists,\r\nonly with its inseparable American companions, bowie-knife, pistol, and\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nA true standard of conduct is found only in the highest civilization,\r\nwith those two inspirations, justice and benevolence,--never in\r\nany barbarism, though affecting the semblance of sensibility and\r\nrefinement. But this standard, while governing the relations of the\r\nindividual, must be recognized by nations also. Alas! alas! how long?\r\nWe still wait that happy day, now beginning to dawn, harbinger of\r\ninfinite happiness beyond, when nations, like men, shall confess that\r\nit is better to receive a wrong than do a wrong.\r\n\r\n5. There is still another influence stimulating War, and interfering\r\nwith the natural attractions of Peace: I refer to a selfish and\r\nexaggerated _prejudice of country_, leading to physical aggrandizement\r\nand political exaltation at the expense of other countries, and in\r\ndisregard of justice. Nursed by the literature of antiquity, we imbibe\r\nthe sentiment of heathen patriotism. Exclusive love for the land of\r\nbirth belonged to the religion of Greece and Rome. This sentiment was\r\nmaterial as well as exclusive. The Oracle directed the returning Roman\r\nto kiss his mother, and he kissed Mother Earth. Agamemnon, according\r\nto Æschylus, on regaining his home, after perilous separation for more\r\nthan ten years at the siege of Troy, before addressing family, friend,\r\nor countryman, salutes Argos:--\r\n\r\n    \"By your leave, lords, first Argos I salute.\"\r\n\r\nThe schoolboy does not forget the victim of Verres, with the memorable\r\ncry which was to stay the descending fasces of the lictor, \"I am a\r\nRoman citizen,\"--nor those other words echoing through the dark Past,\r\n\"How sweet and becoming to die for country!\" Of little avail the\r\nnobler cry, \"I am a man,\" or the Christian ejaculation, swelling the\r\nsoul, \"How sweet and becoming to die for duty!\" The beautiful genius\r\nof Cicero, instinct at times with truth almost divine, did not ascend\r\nto that heaven where it is taught that all mankind are neighbors and\r\nkindred. To the love of universal man may be applied those words by\r\nwhich the great Roman elevated his selfish patriotism to virtue, when\r\nhe said that _country alone embraced all the charities of all_.[75]\r\nAttach this admired phrase to the single idea of country, and you see\r\nhow contracted are its charities, compared with that world-wide circle\r\nwhere our neighbor is the suffering man, though at the farthest pole.\r\nSuch a sentiment would dry up those precious fountains now diffusing\r\nthemselves in distant unenlightened lands, from the icy mountains of\r\nGreenland to the coral islands of the Pacific Sea.\r\n\r\n    [75] \"Cari sunt parentes, cari liberi, propinqui, familiares; sed\r\n_omnes omnium caritates patria una complexa est_.\" (De Offic., Lib.\r\nI. cap. 17.) It is curious to observe how Cicero puts aside that\r\nexpression of true humanity which fell from Terence, \"_Humani nihil\r\na me alienum puto._\" He says, \"_Est enim difficilis cura rerum\r\nalienarum._\" Ibid., Lib. I. cap. 9.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of rulers to encourage this exclusive patriotism, and\r\nhere they are aided by the examples of antiquity. I do not know that\r\nany one nation is permitted to reproach another with this selfishness.\r\nAll are selfish. Men are taught to live, not for mankind, but only for\r\na small portion of mankind. The pride, vanity, ambition, brutality\r\neven, which all rebuke in the individual, are accounted virtues, if\r\ndisplayed in the name of country. Among us the sentiment is active,\r\nwhile it derives new force from the point with which it has been\r\nexpressed. An officer of our navy, one of the heroes nurtured by War,\r\nwhose name has been praised in churches, going beyond all Greek,\r\nall Roman example, exclaimed, \"Our country, _right or wrong_,\"--a\r\nsentiment dethroning God and enthroning the Devil, whose flagitious\r\ncharacter must be rebuked by every honest heart. How different was\r\nvirtuous Andrew Fletcher, whose heroical uprightness, amidst the\r\ntrials of his time, has become immortal in the saying, that he \"would\r\nreadily lose his life to _serve_ his country, but would not do a base\r\nthing to _save_ it.\"[76] Better words, or more truly patriotic, were\r\nnever uttered. \"Our country, our whole country, and _nothing but our\r\ncountry_,\" are other delusive sounds, which, first falling from the\r\nlips of an eminent American orator, are often painted on banners,\r\nand echoed by innumerable multitudes. Cold and dreary, narrow and\r\nselfish would be this life, if _nothing but our country_ occupied the\r\nsoul,--if the thoughts that wander through eternity, if the infinite\r\naffections of our nature, were restrained to that place where we find\r\nourselves by the accident of birth.\r\n\r\n    [76] Character, prefixed to Political Works, p. viii.\r\n\r\nBy a natural sentiment we incline to the spot where we were born, to\r\nthe fields that witnessed the sports of childhood, to the seat of\r\nyouthful studies, and to the institutions under which we have been\r\ntrained. The finger of God writes all these things indelibly upon the\r\nheart of man, so that even in death he reverts with fondness to early\r\nassociations, and longs for a draught of cold water from the bucket in\r\nhis father's well. This sentiment is independent of reflection: for it\r\nbegins before reflection, grows with our growth, and strengthens with\r\nour strength. It is the same in all countries having the same degree\r\nof enlightenment, differing only according to enlightenment, under\r\nwhose genial influence it softens and refines. It is the strongest with\r\nthose least enlightened. The wretched Hottentot never travels away\r\nfrom his melting sun; the wretched Esquimau never travels away from\r\nhis freezing cold; nor does either know or care for other lands. This\r\nis his patriotism. The same instinct belongs to animals. There is no\r\nbeast not instinctively a patriot, cherishing his own country with all\r\nits traditions, which he guards instinctively against all comers. Thus\r\nagain, in considering the origin of War, do we encounter the animal\r\nin man. But as human nature is elevated, as the animal is subdued,\r\nthat patriotism which is without reason shares the generous change and\r\ngradually loses its barbarous egotism. To the enlarged vision a new\r\nworld is disclosed, and we begin to discern the distant mountain-peaks,\r\nall gilded by the beams of morning, revealing that God has not placed\r\nus alone on this earth, but that others, equally with ourselves, are\r\nchildren of his care.\r\n\r\nThe curious spirit goes further, and, while recognizing an inborn\r\nattachment to the place of birth, searches into the nature of the\r\nallegiance required. According to the old idea, still too prevalent,\r\nman is made for the State, not the State for man. Far otherwise is\r\nthe truth. The State is an artificial body, for the security of the\r\npeople. How constantly do we find in human history that the people\r\nare sacrificed for the State,--to build the Roman name, to secure for\r\nEngland the trident of the sea, to carry abroad the conquering eagles\r\nof France! This is to barter the greater for the less,--to sacrifice\r\nhumanity, embracing more even than country _all the charities of all_,\r\nfor the sake of a mistaken grandeur.\r\n\r\nNot that I love country less, but Humanity more, do I now and here\r\nplead the cause of a higher and truer patriotism. I cannot forget that\r\nwe are men by a more sacred bond than we are citizens,--that we are\r\nchildren of a common Father more than we are Americans.\r\n\r\nThus do seeming diversities of nations--separated by accident of\r\nlanguage, mountain, river, or sea--all disappear, and the multitudinous\r\ntribes of the globe stand forth as members of one vast Human Family,\r\nwhere strife is treason to Heaven, and all war is nothing else than\r\n_civil_ war. In vain restrict this odious term, importing so much of\r\nhorror, to the dissensions of a single community. It belongs also to\r\nfeuds between nations. The soul trembles aghast in the contemplation of\r\nfields drenched with fraternal gore, where the happiness of homes is\r\nshivered by neighbors, and kinsman sinks beneath the steel nerved by a\r\nkinsman's hand. This is civil war, accursed forever in the calendar\r\nof Time. In the faithful record of the future, recognizing the True\r\nGrandeur of Nations, the Muse of History, inspired by a loftier justice\r\nand touched to finer sensibilities, will extend to Universal Man the\r\nsympathy now confined to country, and no war will be waged without\r\narousing everlasting judgment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n6. I might here pause, feeling that those who have accompanied me to\r\nthis stage will be ready to join in condemnation of War, and to hail\r\nPeace as the only condition becoming the dignity of human nature,\r\nwhile it opens vistas of all kinds abundant with the most fruitful\r\npromises. But there is one other consideration, yielding to none in\r\nimportance,--perhaps more important than all, being at once cause and\r\neffect,--the cause of strong prejudice in favor of War, and the effect\r\nof this prejudice. I refer to _Preparations for War_ in time of Peace.\r\nHere is an immense practical evil, requiring remedy. In exposing its\r\ncharacter too much care cannot be taken.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall not dwell upon the fearful cost of War itself. That is present\r\nin the mountainous accumulations of debt, piled like Ossa upon Pelion,\r\nwith which civilization is pressed to earth. According to the most\r\nrecent tables, the public debt of European nations, so far as known,\r\namounts to the terrific sum of $7,777,521,840,--all the growth of War!\r\nIt is said that there are throughout these nations 17,000,000 paupers,\r\nor persons subsisting at the public expense, without contributing to\r\nits resources. If these millions of public debt, forming only a part of\r\nwhat has been wasted in War, could be apportioned among these poor, it\r\nwould give to each $450,--a sum placing all above want, and about equal\r\nto the average wealth of an inhabitant of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe public debt of Great Britain in 1842 reached to $3,827,833,102, the\r\ngrowth of War since 1688. This amount is equal to two thirds of all\r\nthe harvest of gold and silver yielded by Spanish America, including\r\nMexico and Peru, from the discovery of our hemisphere by Christopher\r\nColumbus to the beginning of the present century, as calculated by\r\nHumboldt.[77] It is much larger than the mass of all the precious\r\nmetals constituting at this moment the circulating medium of the\r\nworld. Sometimes it is rashly said, by those who have given little\r\nattention to the subject, that all this expenditure has been widely\r\ndistributed, and therefore beneficial to the people; but this apology\r\nforgets that it has not been bestowed on any productive industry or\r\nuseful object. The magnitude of this waste appears by contrast. For\r\ninstance, the aggregate capital of all the joint-stock companies in\r\nEngland of which there was any known record in 1842, embracing canals,\r\ndocks, bridges, insurance, banks, gas-lights, water, mines, railways,\r\nand other miscellaneous objects, was about $800,000,000,--all devoted\r\nto the welfare of the people, but how much less in amount than the\r\nWar Debt! For the six years preceding 1842, the average payment for\r\ninterest on this debt was $141,645,157 annually. If we add to this\r\nsum the further annual outlay of $66,780,817 for the army, navy, and\r\nordnance, we shall have $208,425,974 as the annual tax of the English\r\npeople, to pay for former wars and prepare for new. During this same\r\nperiod, an annual appropriation of $24,858,442 was sufficient for the\r\nentire civil service. Thus War consumed ninety cents of every dollar\r\npressed by heavy taxation from the English people. What fabulous\r\nmonster, what chimæra dire, ever raged with a maw so ravenous? The\r\nremaining ten cents sufficed to maintain the splendor of the throne,\r\nthe administration of justice, and diplomatic relations with foreign\r\npowers,--in short, all the more legitimate objects of a nation.[78]\r\n\r\n    [77] New Spain, Vol. III. p. 431.\r\n\r\n    [78] Here and in subsequent pages I have relied upon the Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica, the Annual Register, McCulloch's Commercial Dictionary,\r\nLaurie's Universal Geography, founded on the works of Malte-Brun and\r\nBalbi, and the calculations of Hon. William Jay, in War and Peace, p.\r\n16, and in his Address before the Peace Society, pp. 28, 29.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus much for the general cost of War. Let us now look exclusively at\r\nthe _Preparations for War in time of Peace_. It is one of the miseries\r\nof War, that even in Peace its evils continue to be felt beyond any\r\nother by which suffering humanity is oppressed. If Bellona withdraws\r\nfrom the field, we only lose sight of her flaming torches; the baying\r\nof her dogs is heard on the mountains, and civilized man thinks to\r\nfind protection from their sudden fury only by inclosing himself in\r\nthe barbarous armor of battle. At this moment, the Christian nations,\r\nworshipping a symbol of common brotherhood, occupy intrenched camps,\r\nwith armed watch, to prevent surprise from each other. Recognizing War\r\nas Arbiter of Justice, they hold themselves perpetually ready for the\r\nbloody umpirage.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to arrive at any exact estimate of\r\nthese Preparations, ranging under four different heads,--Standing Army,\r\nNavy, Fortifications, and Militia, or irregular troops.\r\n\r\nThe number of soldiers now affecting to keep the peace of European\r\nChristendom, as a _Standing Army_, without counting the Navy, is\r\nupwards of two millions: some estimates place it as high as three\r\nmillions. The army of Great Britain, including the forces in India,\r\nexceeds 300,000 men; that of France, 350,000; that of Russia, 730,000,\r\nand is reckoned by some as high as 1,000,000; that of Austria, 275,000;\r\nthat of Prussia, 150,000. Taking the smaller number, and supposing\r\nthese two millions to require for their support an average annual sum\r\nof only $150 each, the result would be $300,000,000 for sustenance\r\nalone; and reckoning one officer to ten soldiers, and allowing to each\r\nof the latter an English shilling a day, or $88.33 a year, for wages,\r\nand to the former an average annual salary of $500, we have for the\r\npay of the whole no less than $258,994,000, or an appalling sum-total,\r\nfor both sustenance and pay, of $558,994,000 a year. If the same\r\ncalculation be made, supposing the force three millions, the sum-total\r\nwill be $838,491,000! But to this enormous sum must be added another\r\nstill more enormous, on account of loss sustained by the withdrawal\r\nof these hardy, healthy millions, in the bloom of life, from useful,\r\nproductive labor. It is supposed that it costs an average sum of $500\r\nto rear a soldier, and that the value of his labor, if devoted to\r\nuseful objects, would be $150 a year. Therefore, in setting apart two\r\nmillions of men as soldiers, the Christian powers sustain a loss of\r\n$1,000,000,000 on account of training, and $300,000,000 on account of\r\nlabor, in addition to the millions annually expended for sustenance\r\nand pay. So much for the Standing Army of Christian Europe in time of\r\nPeace.\r\n\r\nGlance now at the _Navy_. The Royal Navy of Great Britain consists\r\nat present of 557 ships; but deducting such as are used for convict\r\nships, floating chapels, and coal depots, the efficient Navy comprises\r\n88 ships of the line, 109 frigates, 190 small frigates, corvettes,\r\nbrigs, and cutters, including packets, 65 steamers of various sizes, 3\r\ntroop-ships and yachts: in all, 455 ships. Of these, in 1839, 190 were\r\nin commission, carrying in all 4,202 guns, with crews numbering 34,465\r\nmen. The Navy of France, though not comparable with that of England, is\r\nof vast force. By royal ordinance of 1st January, 1837, it was fixed\r\nin time of peace at 40 ships of the line, 50 frigates, 40 steamers,\r\nand 19 smaller vessels, with crews numbering, in 1839, 20,317 men.\r\nThe Russian Navy is composed of two large fleets,--one in the Gulf of\r\nFinland, and the other in the Black Sea; but the exact amount of their\r\nforce is a subject of dispute among naval men and publicists. Some idea\r\nof the Navy may be derived from the number of hands. The crews of the\r\nBaltic amounted, in 1837, to not less than 30,800 men, and those of\r\nthe Black Sea to 19,800, or altogether 50,600,--being nearly equal to\r\nthose of England and France combined. The Austrian Navy comprised, in\r\n1837, 8 ships of the line, 8 frigates, 4 sloops, 6 brigs, 7 schooners\r\nor galleys, and smaller vessels: the number of men in its service, in\r\n1839, was 4,547. The Navy of Denmark comprised, at the close of 1837,\r\n7 ships of the line, 7 frigates, 5 sloops, 6 brigs, 3 schooners, 5\r\ncutters, 58 gunboats, 6 gun-rafts, and 3 bomb-vessels, requiring about\r\n6,500 men. The Navy of Sweden and Norway consisted recently of 238\r\ngunboats, 11 ships of the line, 8 frigates, 4 corvettes, and 6 brigs,\r\nwith several smaller vessels. The Navy of Greece has 32 ships of\r\nwar, carrying 190 guns, with 2,400 men. The Navy of Holland, in 1839,\r\nhad 8 ships of the line, 21 frigates, 15 corvettes, 21 brigs, and 95\r\ngunboats. Of the untold cost absorbed in these mighty Preparations it\r\nis impossible to form an accurate idea. But we may lament that means\r\nso gigantic are applied by Christian Europe, in time of Peace, to the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of such superfluous wooden walls.\r\n\r\nIn the _Fortifications and Arsenals_ of Europe, crowning every height,\r\ncommanding every valley, frowning over every plain and every sea,\r\nwealth beyond calculation has been sunk. Who can tell the immense\r\nsums expended in hollowing out the living rock of Gibraltar? Who can\r\ncalculate the cost of all the Preparations at Woolwich, its 27,000\r\ncannon, and its small arms counted by hundreds of thousands? France\r\nalone contains more than one hundred and twenty fortified places; and\r\nit is supposed that the yet unfinished fortifications of Paris have\r\ncost upward of _fifty millions of dollars_.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the _Militia_, or irregular troops, the Yeomanry of\r\nEngland, the National Guard of Paris, and the _Landwehr_ and\r\n_Landsturm_ of Prussia, must add other incalculable sums to these\r\nenormous amounts.\r\n\r\nTurn now to the United States, separated by a broad ocean from\r\nimmediate contact with the Great Powers of Christendom, bound by\r\ntreaties of amity and commerce with all the nations of the earth,\r\nconnected with all by strong ties of mutual interest, and professing a\r\ndevotion to the principles of Peace. Are Treaties of Amity mere words?\r\nAre relations of Commerce and mutual interest mere things of a day? Are\r\nprofessions of Peace vain? Else why not repose in quiet, unvexed by\r\nPreparations for War?\r\n\r\nColossal as are European expenditures for these purposes, they are\r\nstill greater among us in proportion to other expenses of the National\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the average _annual_ expenses of the National\r\nGovernment, for the six years ending 1840, exclusive of payments\r\non account of debt, were $26,474,892. Of this sum, the average\r\nappropriation each year for military and naval purposes amounted\r\nto $21,328,903, being eighty per cent. Yes,--of all the annual\r\nappropriations by the National Government, eighty cents in every\r\ndollar were applied in this unproductive manner. The remaining twenty\r\ncents sufficed to maintain the Government in all its branches,\r\nExecutive, Legislative, and Judicial,--the administration of justice,\r\nour relations with foreign nations, the post-office, and all the\r\nlight-houses, which, in happy, useful contrast with the forts, shed\r\ntheir cheerful signals over the rough waves beating upon our long and\r\nindented coast, from the Bay of Fundy to the mouth of the Mississippi.\r\nThe relative expenditures of nations for Military Preparations in time\r\nof Peace, exclusive of payments on account of debts, when accurately\r\nunderstood, must surprise the advocates of economy in our country.\r\nIn proportion to the whole expenditure of Government, they are, in\r\nAustria, as 33 per cent; in France, as 38 per cent; in Prussia, as 44\r\nper cent; in Great Britain, as 74 per cent; in the UNITED STATES, as 80\r\nper cent![79]\r\n\r\n    [79] I have verified these results, but do little more than follow\r\nJudge Jay, who has illustrated this important point with his accustomed\r\naccuracy.--_Address before the American Peace Society_, p. 30.\r\n\r\nTo this stupendous waste may be added the still larger and equally\r\nsuperfluous expenses of the Militia throughout the country, placed\r\nrecently by a candid and able writer at $50,000,000 a year![80]\r\n\r\n    [80] Jay, War and Peace, p. 13.\r\n\r\nBy a table of the National expenditures,[81] exclusive of payments on\r\naccount of the Public Debt, it appears, that, _in fifty-four years\r\nfrom the formation of our present Government_, that is, from 1789 down\r\nto 1843, $155,282,217 were expended for civil purposes, comprehending\r\nthe executive, the legislative, the judiciary, the post-office,\r\nlight-houses, and intercourse with foreign governments. During this\r\nsame period, $370,981,521 were devoted to the Military establishment,\r\nand $169,707,214 to the Naval establishment,--the two forming an\r\naggregate of $540,688,735. Deducting from this amount appropriations\r\nduring three years of War, and we find that more than _four hundred\r\nand sixty millions_ were absorbed by vain Preparations for War in time\r\nof Peace. Add to this amount a moderate sum for the expenses of the\r\nMilitia during the same period, which, as we have seen, are placed\r\nat $50,000,000 a year,--for the past years we may take an average of\r\n$25,000,000,--and we have the enormous sum-total of $1,350,000,000\r\npiled upon the $460,000,000, the whole amounting to _eighteen hundred\r\nand ten millions_ of dollars, a sum not easily conceived by the human\r\nfaculties, sunk, under the sanction of the National Government, in mere\r\n_peaceful Preparations for War_: almost _twelve times_ as much as was\r\ndedicated by the National Government, during the same period, to all\r\nother purposes whatsoever.\r\n\r\n    [81] Executive Document No. 15, Twenty-Eighth Congress, First Session,\r\npp. 1018-19.\r\n\r\nFrom this serried array of figures the mind instinctively recoils.\r\nIf we examine them from a nearer point of view, and, selecting some\r\nparticular item, compare it with the figures representing other\r\ninterests in the community, they will present a front still more dread.\r\n\r\nWithin cannon-range of this city stands an institution of\r\nlearning which was one of the earliest cares of our forefathers,\r\nthe conscientious Puritans.

There\r\nnow swings idly at her moorings in this harbor a ship of the line,\r\nthe Ohio, carrying ninety guns, finished as late as 1836 at an\r\nexpense of $547,888,--repaired only two years afterwards, in 1838,\r\nfor $233,012,--with an armament which has cost $53,945,--making an\r\naggregate of $834,845, as the actual outlay at this moment for that\r\nsingle ship,[83]--more than $100,000 beyond all the available wealth of\r\nthe richest and most ancient seat of learning in the land! Choose ye,\r\nmy fellow-citizens of a Christian state, between the two caskets,--that\r\nwherein is the loveliness of truth, or that which contains the carrion\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n    [83] Executive Document No. 132, Twenty-Seventh Congress, Third\r\n    Session.\r\n\r\nI refer to the Ohio because this ship happens to be in our waters; but\r\nI do not take the strongest case afforded by our Navy. Other ships have\r\nabsorbed larger sums. The expense of the Delaware, in 1842, had reached\r\n$1,051,000.\r\n\r\nPursue the comparison still further. The expenditures of the University\r\nduring the last year, for the general purposes of the College, the\r\ninstruction of the Undergraduates, and for the Schools of Law and\r\nDivinity, amounted to $47,935. The cost of the Ohio for one year of\r\nservice, in salaries, wages, and provisions, is $220,000,--being\r\n$172,000 above the annual expenditures of the University, and more than\r\n_four times_ as much as those expenditures. In other words, for the\r\nannual sum lavished on a single ship of the line, _four_ institutions\r\nlike Harvard University might be supported.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the pay of the Captain of a ship like the Ohio is $4,500,\r\nwhen in service,--$3,500, when on leave of absence, or off duty. The\r\nsalary of the President of Harvard University is $2,235, without leave\r\nof absence, and never off duty.\r\n\r\nIf the large endowments of Harvard University are dwarfed by comparison\r\nwith a single ship of the line, how must it be with other institutions\r\nof learning and beneficence, less favored by the bounty of many\r\ngenerations? The average cost of a sloop of war is $315,000,--more,\r\nprobably, than all the endowments of those twin stars of learning\r\nin the Western part of Massachusetts, the Colleges at Williamstown\r\nand Amherst, and of that single star in the East, the guide to many\r\ningenuous youth, the Seminary at Andover. The yearly expense of a sloop\r\nof war in service is about $50,000,--more than the annual expenditures\r\nof these three institutions combined.\r\n\r\nI might press the comparison with other institutions of\r\nbeneficence,--with our annual appropriations for the Blind, that noble\r\nand successful charity which sheds true lustre upon the Commonwealth,\r\namounting to $12,000, and for the Insane, another charity dear to\r\nhumanity, amounting to $27,844.\r\n\r\nTake all the institutions of Learning and Beneficence, the crown jewels\r\nof the Commonwealth, schools, colleges, hospitals, asylums, and the\r\nsums by which they have been purchased and preserved are trivial and\r\nbeggarly, compared with the treasures squandered within the borders\r\nof Massachusetts in vain Preparations for War,--upon the Navy Yard\r\nat Charlestown, with its stores on hand, costing $4,741,000,--the\r\nfortifications in the harbors of Massachusetts, where untold sums are\r\nalready sunk, and it is now proposed to sink $3,875,000 more,[84]--and\r\nthe Arsenal at Springfield, containing, in 1842, 175,118 muskets,\r\nvalued at $2,099,998,[85] and maintained by an annual appropriation\r\nof $200,000, whose highest value will ever be, in the judgment of\r\nall lovers of truth, that it inspired a poem which in influence\r\nwill be mightier than a battle, and will endure when arsenals and\r\nfortifications have crumbled to earth. Some of the verses of this Psalm\r\nof Peace may relieve the detail of statistics, while they happily blend\r\nwith my argument.\r\n\r\n    \"Were half the power that fills the world with terror,\r\n    Were half the wealth bestowed on camps and courts,\r\n    Given to redeem the human mind from error,\r\n    There were no need of arsenals or forts:\r\n\r\n    \"The warrior's name would be a name abhorred,\r\n    And every nation that should lift again\r\n    Its hand against a brother on its forehead\r\n    Would wear forevermore the curse of Cain.\"[86]\r\n\r\n    [84] Report of Secretary of War, Senate Document No. 2, Twenty-Seventh\r\nCongress, Second Session,--where we are asked to invest in a general\r\nsystem of land defences $51,677,929.\r\n\r\n    [85] Executive Document No. 3, Twenty-Seventh Congress, Third Session.\r\n\r\n    [86] Longfellow, The Arsenal at Springfield.\r\n\r\nTurn now to a high and peculiar interest of the nation, the\r\nadministration of justice. Perhaps no part of our system is regarded\r\nwith more pride and confidence, especially by the enlightened sense of\r\nthe country. To this, indeed, all other concerns of Government, with\r\nall its complications of machinery, are in a manner subordinate, since\r\nit is for the sake of justice that men come together in communities\r\nand establish laws. What part of the Government can compare in\r\nimportance with the National Judiciary, that great balance-wheel of the\r\nConstitution, controlling the relations of the several States to each\r\nother, the legislation of Congress and of the States, besides private\r\ninterests to an incalculable amount? Nor can the citizen who discerns\r\nthe true glory of his country fail to recognize in the immortal\r\njudgments of MARSHALL, now departed, and of STORY, who is still spared\r\nto us--_serus in coelum redeat!_--a higher claim to admiration and\r\ngratitude than can be found in any triumph of battle. The expenses of\r\nthis great department under the National Government, in 1842, embracing\r\nthe cost of court-houses, the salaries of judges, the pay of juries,\r\nand of all the law officers throughout the United States, in short,\r\nall the outlay by which justice, according to the requirement of Magna\r\nCharta, is carried to every man's door, amounted to $560,990,--a\r\nlarger sum than is usually appropriated for this purpose, but how\r\ninsignificant, compared with the cormorant demands of Army and Navy!\r\n\r\nLet me allude to one more curiosity of waste. By a calculation founded\r\non the expenses of the Navy it appears that the average cost of each\r\ngun carried over the ocean for one year amounts to about fifteen\r\nthousand dollars,--a sum sufficient to maintain ten or even twenty\r\nprofessors of Colleges, and equal to the salaries of all the Judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court of Massachusetts and the Governor combined!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are illustrations of that tax which nations constituting the great\r\nFederation of Civilization, including our own country, impose on the\r\npeople, in time of profound peace, for no permanent productive work,\r\nfor no institution of learning, for no gentle charity, for no purpose\r\nof good. Wearily climbing from expenditure to expenditure, from waste\r\nto waste, we seem to pass beyond the region of ordinary measurement;\r\nAlps on Alps arise, on whose crowning heights of everlasting cold, far\r\nabove the habitations of man, where no green thing lives, where no\r\ncreature draws breath, we behold the sharp, icy, flashing glacier of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nIn the contemplation of this spectacle the soul swells with alternate\r\ndespair and hope: with despair, at the thought of such wealth, capable\r\nof such service to Humanity, not merely wasted, but bestowed to\r\nperpetuate Hate; with hope, as the blessed vision arises of all these\r\nincalculable means secured to purposes of Peace. The whole world labors\r\nwith poverty and distress; and the painful question occurs in Europe\r\nmore than here, What shall become of the poor,--the increasing Standing\r\nArmy of the poor? Could the voice that now addresses you penetrate\r\nthose distant councils, or councils nearer home, it would say, Disband\r\nyour Standing Armies of soldiers, employ your Navies in peaceful and\r\nenriching commerce, abandon Fortifications and Arsenals, or dedicate\r\nthem to works of Beneficence, as the statue of Jupiter Capitolinus was\r\nchanged to the image of a Christian saint; in fine, utterly renounce\r\nthe present incongruous system of _Armed Peace_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat I may not seem to accept this conclusion too hastily, at least as\r\nregards our own country, I shall consider the asserted usefulness of\r\nthe national armaments,--and then expose the fallacy, at least in the\r\npresent age and among Christian nations, of the maxim, that in time of\r\nPeace we must prepare for War.\r\n\r\n_For what use is the Standing Army of the United States?_ For many\r\ngenerations it has been a principle of freedom to avoid a standing\r\narmy; and one of the complaints in the Declaration of Independence\r\nwas, that George the Third had quartered large bodies of troops in\r\nthe Colonies. For the first years after the adoption of the National\r\nConstitution, during our period of weakness, before our power was\r\nassured, before our name had become respected in the family of nations,\r\nunder the administration of Washington, a small sum was ample for the\r\nmilitary establishment of the United States. It was at a later day that\r\nthe country, touched by martial insanity, abandoned the true economy of\r\na Republic, and, in imitation of monarchical powers, lavished means,\r\ngrudged to Peace, in vain preparation for War. It may now be said\r\nof our Army, as Dunning said of the influence of the Crown, it has\r\nincreased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished. At this moment\r\nthere are in the country more than sixty military posts. For any of\r\nthese it would be difficult to present a reasonable apology,--unless,\r\nperhaps, on some distant Indian frontier. Of what use is the\r\ndetachment of the Second Artillery at the quiet town of New London, in\r\nConnecticut? Of what use is the detachment of the First Artillery in\r\nthat pleasant resort of fashion, Newport? By exhilarating music and\r\nshowy parade they may amuse an idle hour; but is it not equally true\r\nthat emotions of a different character will be aroused in thoughtful\r\nbosoms? He must have lost something of sensibility to the dignity of\r\nhuman nature who can observe, without at least a passing regret, all\r\nthe details of discipline--drill, marching, countermarching--which\r\nfill the life of the soldier, and prepare him to become the rude,\r\ninanimate part of that _machine_ to which an army is likened by the\r\ngreat living master of the Art of War.[87] And this sensibility may be\r\nmore disturbed by the spectacle of ingenuous youth, in chosen numbers,\r\nunder the auspices of the Government, amidst the bewitching scenery of\r\nWest Point, painfully trained to these same exercises,--at a cost to\r\nthe country, since the establishment of this Academy, of above four\r\nmillions of dollars.\r\n\r\n    [87] The Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Standing Armies are supposed to be needed in support of\r\nGovernment; but this excuse cannot prevail here. The monarchs of the\r\nOld World, like the chiefs of the ancient German tribes, are upborne\r\non the shields of the soldiery. Happily, with us, Government needs no\r\njanizaries. The hearts of the people are a sufficient support.\r\n\r\nI hear a voice from some defender of this abuse, some upholder of this\r\n\"rotten borough,\" crying, The Army is needed for defence! As well might\r\nyou say that the shadow is needed for defence. For what is the Army of\r\nthe United States, but the feeble shadow of the American people? _In\r\nplacing the Army on its present footing, so small in numbers, compared\r\nwith the forces of great_ _European States, our Government tacitly\r\nadmits its superfluousness for defence._ It only remains to declare\r\nthat the country will repose in the consciousness of right, without the\r\nextravagance of soldiers, unproductive consumers of the fruits of the\r\nearth, who might do the country good service in the various departments\r\nof useful industry.\r\n\r\n_For what use is the Navy of the United States?_ The annual expense\r\nof our Navy, during recent years, has been upwards of six millions of\r\ndollars. For what purpose? Not for the apprehension of pirates, since\r\nfrigates and ships of the line are of too great bulk for this service.\r\nNot for the suppression of the Slave Trade; for, under the stipulations\r\nwith Great Britain, we employ only eighty guns in this holy alliance.\r\nNot to protect our coasts; for all agree that our few ships would\r\nform an unavailing defence against any serious attack. Not for these\r\npurposes, you admit; _but for the protection of our Navigation_. This\r\nis not the occasion for minute estimates. Suffice it to say, that\r\nan intelligent merchant, extensively engaged in commerce for the\r\nlast twenty years, and who speaks, therefore, with the authority of\r\nknowledge, has demonstrated, in a tract of perfect clearness,[88] that\r\nthe annual profits of the whole mercantile marine of the country do\r\nnot equal the annual expenditure of our Navy. Admitting the profit of\r\na merchant ship to be four thousand dollars a year, which is a large\r\nallowance, it will take the earnings of one hundred ships to build and\r\nemploy for one year a single sloop of war, of one hundred and fifty\r\nships to build and employ a frigate, and of nearly three hundred ships\r\nto build and employ a ship of the line. Thus more than five hundred\r\nships must do a profitable business to earn a sufficient sum for the\r\nsupport of this little fleet. Still further, taking a received estimate\r\nputting the mercantile marine of the United States at forty millions\r\nof dollars, we find that it is only a little more than six times the\r\nannual cost of the Navy; so that this interest is protected at a charge\r\nof more than _fifteen per cent_ of its whole value! Protection at such\r\nprice is not less ruinous than one of Pyrrhus's victories.\r\n\r\n    [88] I refer to the pamphlet of S.E. Coues, \"United States Navy: What\r\nis its Use?\"\r\n\r\nIt is to the Navy as an unnecessary arm of national defence, and part\r\nof the War establishment, that I confine my objection. So far as it is\r\nrequired for science, or for the _police_ of the seas,--to scour them\r\nof pirates, and, above all, to defeat the hateful traffic in human\r\nflesh,--it is a fit engine of Government, and cannot be obnoxious as\r\na portion of the machinery of War. But, surely, a most costly navy to\r\nprotect navigation in time of Peace against assaults from civilized\r\nnations is absurdly superfluous. The free cities of Hamburg and Bremen,\r\nsurvivors of the powerful Hanseatic League, with a commerce whitening\r\nthe most distant seas, are without a single ship of war. Following\r\nthis prudent example, the United States might be willing to abandon an\r\ninstitution already become a vain and expensive toy.\r\n\r\n_For what use are the Fortifications of the United States?_ We have\r\nalready seen the enormous sums locked in the odious mortmain of\r\ntheir everlasting masonry. Like the Pyramids, they seem by mass and\r\nsolidity to defy Time. Nor can I doubt that hereafter, like these\r\nsame monuments, they will be looked upon with wonder, as the types\r\nof an extinct superstition, not less degrading than that of Ancient\r\nEgypt. Under the pretence of saving the country from conquest and\r\nbloodshed they are reared. But whence the danger? On what side?\r\nWhat people to fear? No civilized nation threatens our borders\r\nwith rapine or trespass. None will. Nor, in the existing state of\r\ncivilization, and under existing International Law, is it possible to\r\nsuppose any war with such a nation, unless, renouncing the peaceful\r\nTribunal of Arbitration, we voluntarily appeal to Trial by Battle.\r\nThe fortifications might be of service then. But perhaps they would\r\ninvite the attack they might be inadequate to defeat. According to\r\na modern rule, illustrated with admirable ability in the diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence of Mr. Webster, non-combatants and their property on\r\nland are not molested. So firmly did the Duke of Wellington act upon\r\nthis rule, that, throughout the revengeful campaigns of Spain, and\r\nafterwards entering France, flushed with the victory of Waterloo,\r\nhe directed his army to pay for all provisions, even the forage of\r\ntheir horses. War is carried on against _public_ property,--against\r\n_fortifications, navy-yards, and arsenals_. If these do not exist,\r\nwhere is its aliment, where the fuel for the flame? Paradoxical as it\r\nseems, and disparaging to the whole trade of War, it may be proper to\r\ninquire, whether, according to acknowledged laws, now governing this\r\nbloody arbitrament, every new fortification and every additional gun\r\nin our harbor is not less a safeguard than a danger. Do they not draw\r\nthe lightning of battle upon our homes, without, alas! any conductor to\r\nhurry its terrors innocently beneath the concealing bosom of the earth?\r\n\r\n_For what use is the Militia of the United States?_ This immense\r\nsystem spreads, with innumerable suckers, over the whole country,\r\ndraining its best life-blood, the unbought energies of our youth. The\r\nsame painful discipline which we observe in the soldier absorbs their\r\ntime, though to a less degree than in the Regular Army. Theirs also is\r\nthe savage pomp of War. We read with astonishment of the painted flesh\r\nand uncouth vestments of our progenitors, the ancient Britons. But the\r\ngeneration will come, that must regard with equal wonder the pictures\r\nof their ancestors closely dressed in padded and well-buttoned coats\r\nof blue \"besmeared with gold,\" surmounted by a huge mountain-cap of\r\nshaggy bear-skin, and with a barbarous device, typical of brute force,\r\n_a tiger_, painted on oil-skin tied with leather to their backs! In the\r\nstreets of Pisa the galley-slaves are compelled to wear dresses stamped\r\nwith the name of the crime for which they are suffering punishment,--as\r\ntheft, robbery, murder. Is it not a little strange that Christians,\r\nliving in a land \"where bells have tolled to church,\" should\r\nvoluntarily adopt devices which, if they have any meaning, recognize\r\nthe example of beasts as worthy of imitation by man?\r\n\r\nThe general considerations belonging to Preparations for War illustrate\r\nthe inanity of the Militia for purposes of _national defence_. I do\r\nnot know, indeed, that it is now strongly urged on this ground. It\r\nis oftener approved as an important part of the _police_. I would\r\nnot undervalue the advantage of an active, efficient, ever-wakeful\r\npolice; and I believe that such a police has been long required. But\r\nthe Militia, where youth and character are without the strength of\r\nexperience, is inadequate for this purpose. No person who has seen this\r\narm of the police in an actual riot can hesitate in this judgment. A\r\nvery small portion of the means absorbed by the Militia would provide\r\na substantial police, competent to all the domestic emergencies\r\nof disorder and violence. The city of Boston has discarded a Fire\r\nDepartment composed of _accidental volunteers_. Why not do the same\r\nwith the police, and set another example to the country?\r\n\r\nI am well aware that efforts to reduce the Militia are encountered\r\nby some of the dearest prejudices of the common mind,--not only by\r\nthe War Spirit, but by that other, which first animates childhood,\r\nand, at a later day, \"children of a larger growth,\" inviting to\r\nfinery of dress and parade,--the same which fantastically bedecks\r\nthe dusky feather-cinctured chief of the soft regions warmed by the\r\ntropical sun,--which inserts a ring in the nose of the North American\r\nIndian,--which slits the ears of the Australian savage, and tattoos the\r\nNew Zealand cannibal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are the national armaments, in their true character and value.\r\nThus far I have regarded them in the plainest light of ordinary worldly\r\neconomy, without reference to those higher considerations, drawn from\r\nthe nature and history of man and the truths of Christianity, which\r\npronounce them vain. It is grateful to know, that, though having yet\r\nthe support of what Jeremy Taylor calls \"popular noises,\" the other\r\nmore economical, more humane, more wise, more Christian system is daily\r\ncommending itself to good people. On its side are all the virtues\r\nthat truly elevate a state. Economy, sick of pygmy efforts to stanch\r\nthe smallest fountain and rill of exuberant expenditure, pleads that\r\nhere is a measureless, fathomless, endless river, an Amazon of waste,\r\nrolling its prodigal waters turbidly, ruinously, hatefully, to the\r\nsea. It chides us with unnatural inconsistency, when we strain at a\r\nlittle twine and paper, and swallow the monstrous cables and armaments\r\nof War. Humanity pleads for the surpassing interests of Knowledge\r\nand Benevolence, from which such mighty means are withdrawn. Wisdom\r\nfrowns on these Preparations, as nursing sentiments inconsistent with\r\nPeace; Christianity calmly rebukes the spirit in which they have their\r\norigin, as of little faith, and treacherous to her high behests; while\r\nHistory, exhibiting the sure, though gradual, Progress of Man, points\r\nwith unerring finger to that destiny of True Grandeur, when nations,\r\nlike individuals, disowning War as a proper Arbiter of Justice, shall\r\nabandon the oppressive apparatus of Armies, Navies, and Fortifications,\r\nby which it is waged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore considering the familiar injunction, _In time of Peace prepare\r\nfor War_, I hope I shall not seem to descend from the proper sphere\r\nof this discussion, if I refer to the parade of _barbarous mottoes_,\r\nand of _emblems from beasts_, as another impediment to the proper\r\nappreciation of these Preparations. These mottoes and emblems,\r\nprompting to War, are obtruded on the very ensigns of power and\r\nhonor, and, careless of their discreditable import, men learn to\r\nregard them with patriotic pride. In the armorial bearings of nations\r\nand individuals, beasts and birds of prey are the exemplars of True\r\nGrandeur. The lion appears on the flag of England; the leopard on\r\nthe flag of Scotland; a double-headed eagle spreads its wings on the\r\nimperial standard of Austria, and again on that of Russia; while a\r\nsingle-headed eagle was adopted on the Napoleonic seal, and thus\r\nfar the same single-headed bird is enough for Prussia. The pennons\r\nof knights, after exhausting the known kingdom of Nature, were\r\ndisfigured by imaginary and impossible monsters, griffins, hippogriffs,\r\nunicorns, all intended to represent the exaggeration of brute force.\r\nThe people of Massachusetts unconsciously adopt this early standard.\r\nThe escutcheon used as the seal of the State has an unfortunate\r\ncombination, to which I refer briefly by way of example. On that part\r\nin the language of heraldry termed the _shield_ stands an Indian with\r\na bow in his hand,--certainly no agreeable memento, except to those\r\nwho find honor in the disgraceful wars where our fathers robbed and\r\nmurdered King Philip of Pokanoket, and his tribe, rightful possessors\r\nof the soil. The _crest_ is a raised arm _holding a drawn sabre in a\r\nthreatening attitude_,--being precisely the emblem once borne on the\r\nflag of Algiers. The _scroll_, or legend, is the latter of two favorite\r\nverses, in modern Latin, which are not traced to any origin more remote\r\nthan Algernon Sidney, by whom they were inscribed in an album at\r\nCopenhagen:-\r\n\r\n    \"Manus hæc inimica tyrannnis\r\n    _Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem_.\"[89]\r\n\r\n    [89] The Earl of Leicester, father of Sidney, in an anxious letter,\r\nAugust 30, 1660, writes his son: \"It is said that the University\r\nof Copenhagen brought their Album unto you, desiring you to write\r\nsomething therein, and that your did _scribere in Albo_ these words\r\n[setting forth the verses], and put your name to it\"; and then he\r\nadds, \"This cannot but be publicly known, if it be true.... Either you\r\nmust live in exile or very privately here, and perhaps not safely.\"\r\nThe restoration of Charles the Second had just taken place. (Meadley,\r\nMemoirs of Algernon Sidney, pp. 84, 323-325.) Lord Molesworth, in a\r\nwork which first appeared in 1694, mentions the verses as written by\r\nSidney in \"the Book of Mottoes in the King's Library,\" and then tells\r\nthe story, that the French Ambassador, who did not know a word of\r\nLatin, on learning their meaning, tore them from the book, as a libel\r\non the French government, and its influence in Denmark. (Molesworth,\r\nAccount of Denmark, Preface.) The inference from this narrative would\r\nseem to be that the verses were by Sidney himself.\r\n\r\nWith singular unanimity, the Legislature of Massachusetts has expressed\r\nan earnest desire for the establishment of a High Court of Nations\r\nto adjudge international controversies, and thus supersede the\r\nArbitrament of War. It would be an act of moral dignity consistent\r\nwith these professions, and becoming the character it vaunts before\r\nthe world, if it abandoned the bellicose escutcheon,--at least, that\r\n_Algerine_ emblem, fit only for corsairs, if not also the Latin motto\r\nwith its menace of the sword. If a Latin substitute for the latter\r\nbe needed, it might be those words of Virgil, \"_Pacisque_ imponere\r\nmorem,\"[90] or that sentence of noble truth from Cicero, \"Sine SUMMA\r\nJUSTITIA rempublicam geri nullo modo posse\":[91] the first a homage to\r\nPeace, and the second a consecration to Justice. Where such a spirit\r\nprevailed, there would be little occasion to consider the question of\r\nWar Preparations.\r\n\r\n    [90] Æneid, VI. 852.\r\n\r\n    [91] De Republica, Lib. II. cap. 43.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts is not alone in the bellicose anachronism of her banner.\r\nThe nation is in the same category. Our fathers would have hesitated\r\nlong before accepting the eagle for the national escutcheon, had they\r\nrecalled the pungent words of Erasmus on this most unrepublican bird.\r\n\"Let any physiognomist, not a blunderer in his trade,\" says this most\r\nlearned scholar, \"consider the look and features of an eagle, those\r\nrapacious and wicked eyes, that menacing curve of the beak, those\r\ncruel cheeks, that stern front,--will he not at once recognize _the\r\nimage of a king_, a magnificent and majestic king? Add to these a\r\ndark, ill-omened color, an unpleasing, dreadful, appalling voice,\r\nand that threatening scream at which every kind of animal trembles.\"\r\nProceeding with his indictment, he describes the eagle in old age as\r\nsatisfied with nothing but blood, with which he prolongs his hateful\r\nlife, the upper mandible growing so that he cannot feed on flesh, while\r\nthe natural rapacity continues,--all of which typifies the wicked\r\nprince. But the scholar becomes orator, when, after mentioning that\r\nthere are innumerable species of birds, some admirable for richness\r\nof plumage, some remarkable for snowy whiteness, some shining with\r\nbefitting blackness, some pre-eminent in bodily stature, some notable\r\nfor fecundity, some grateful at the rich banquet, some pleasant\r\nfrom loquacity, some captivating in song, some distinguished for\r\ncourage, some created for the entertainment of man,--he proceeds to\r\nsay: \"Of all birds, the eagle alone has seemed to wise men _the apt\r\ntype of royalty_: not beautiful, not musical, not fit for food,--but\r\ncarnivorous, ravenous, plundering, destroying, fighting, solitary,\r\nhateful to all, the curse of all, and though able to do the greatest\r\nharm, yet wishing to do more than he can.\"[92] Erasmus, who says this\r\nand much more, is no mean authority. Brightest and best among the\r\nscholars who illustrated the modern revival of letters, loving peace,\r\nand detesting kings, he acquired a contemporary power and fame such\r\nas letters never bestowed before, if since,--at least until Voltaire,\r\nkindred in versatile genius, mounted the throne. In all the homage\r\nprofusely offered to the latter there was nothing stronger than that\r\nof Luther to Erasmus, when the great Reformer asked, \"Who is the man\r\nwhose soul Erasmus does not occupy, whom Erasmus does not instruct,\r\nover whom Erasmus does not reign?\" His face is still familiar from the\r\ndevotion of two great artists, Albert Dürer and Hans Holbein, each of\r\nwhom has left to us his portrait,--while he is commemorated by a bronze\r\nstatue in Rotterdam, his birthplace, and by a monument in the ancient\r\ncathedral at Basel, where he died. It is this renowned scholar who\r\ncastigates our eagle. Doubtless for fighting qualities this royal bird\r\nwas transferred to the coin and seal of a Republic. His presence there\r\nshows the spirit which unconsciously prevailed; and this same presence,\r\nbeyond all question, exercises a certain influence, especially with the\r\nyoung, nursing a pride in that beak and those pounces which are the\r\nmenace of War.\r\n\r\n    [92] Erasmi Adagia, Chil. III. Cent. VII. Prov. 1: _Scarabæus aquilam\r\nquærit._ Hallam, Literature of Europe, Part I. ch. 4. sec. 43, 44.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe maxim, _In time of Peace prepare for War_,[93] is transmitted from\r\ndistant ages, when brute force was the general law. It is the terrible\r\ninheritance which painfully reminds present generations of their\r\nconnection with the Past. It belongs to the dogmas of barbarism. It is\r\nthe companion of harsh, tyrannical rules by which the happiness of the\r\nmany is offered up to the few. It is the child of suspicion, and the\r\nforerunner of violence. Having in its favor almost uninterrupted usage,\r\nit possesses a hold on popular opinion not easily unloosed. And yet\r\nno conscientious man can fail, on careful observation, to detect its\r\nmischievous fallacy,--_at least among Christian nations in the present\r\nage_,--a fallacy the most costly the world has witnessed, dooming\r\nnations to annual tribute in comparison with which the extortions of\r\nconquest are as the widow's mite. So true is what Rousseau said, and\r\nGuizot has since repeated, that \"a bad principle is far worse than a\r\nbad fact\"; for the operations of the latter are finite, while those of\r\nthe former are infinite.\r\n\r\n    [93] If countenance were needed in thus exposing a pernicious maxim, I\r\nmight find it in the German philosopher Kant, whose work on Perpetual\r\nPeace treats it with very little respect. (Kant, Sämmtliche Werke,\r\nBand VII., _Zum Ewigen Frieden_, § 1.) Since this Oration, Sir Robert\r\nPeel and the Earl of Aberdeen, each Prime Minister of England, and\r\npractically conversant with the question, have given their valuable\r\ntestimony in the same direction. Life has its surprises; and I confess\r\none in my own, when the latter, in conversation on this maxim, most\r\nkindly thanked me for what I had said against it.\r\n\r\nI speak of this principle with earnestness; for I believe it erroneous\r\nand false, founded in ignorance and wrong, unworthy of civilization,\r\nand disgraceful to Christians. I call it a principle; but it is a mere\r\n_prejudice_,--sustained by vulgar example only, and not by enlightened\r\ntruth,--obeying which, we imitate the early mariners, who, steering\r\nfrom headland to headland, hugged the shore, unwilling to venture upon\r\nthe broad ocean, with the luminaries of heaven for their guide. If not\r\nyet discerned in its true character, it is because the clear light of\r\ntruth is discolored and refracted by an atmosphere where the cloud of\r\nWar covers all.\r\n\r\nDismissing the actual usage on the one side, and considerations of\r\neconomy on the other, I would regard these Preparations in the simple\r\nlight of reason, in a just appreciation of the nature of man, and in\r\nthe injunctions of the highest truth. Our conclusion will be very\r\neasy. They are twice pernicious, and whoso would vindicate them must\r\nsatisfactorily answer these two objections: _first_, that they inflame\r\nthe people, exciting to deeds of violence, otherwise alien to the\r\nmind; and, _secondly_, that, having their origin in the low motives of\r\ndistrust and hate, inevitably, by a sure law of the human mind, they\r\nexcite to corresponding action in other nations. Thus, in fact, are\r\nthey _promoters of War_, rather than _preservers of Peace_.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the _first_ objection, it will occur at once to\r\nevery inquirer that the possession of power is in itself dangerous,\r\ntempting the purest and highest, and too rarely enjoyed without\r\nabuse. Nor is the power to employ force in War an exception. Nations\r\npossessing the greatest armaments are the most belligerent. It is the\r\nfeebler powers which enjoy eras of Peace. Throughout more than seven\r\nhundred years of Roman history resounds the din of War, with only two\r\nshort lulls of Peace; and in modern times this din has been echoed from\r\nFrance. But Switzerland has had no din. Less prepared, this Republic\r\nhad less incentive to War. Not only in nations do we find this law. It\r\napplies to individuals also. The same din which resounded in Rome and\r\nwas echoed from France has filled common life, and from the same cause.\r\nThe _wearing of arms_ has been a provocative, too often exciting, as it\r\nfurnished the weapon of strife. The odious system of private quarrels,\r\nwith altercation and hostile meetings even in the street, disgracing\r\nthe social life of modern Europe, continued with this habit. This was\r\nits origin. But who can measure the extent of its influence? Dead\r\nbodies stretched on the pavements, and vacant chairs at home, were the\r\ncontemporary witnesses. If death was hasty and unpremeditated, it was\r\nonly according to the law of such encounter. Poets and authors, wearing\r\narms, were exposed to the rude chances. The dramatist Marlowe, in some\r\nrespects almost Shakespearian, \"renowned for his rare art and wit,\"\r\nperished ignominiously under the weapon of a vulgar adversary; and\r\nSavage, whose genius and misfortune inspired the friendship and praise\r\nof Samuel Johnson, was tried at the Old Bailey for murder committed in\r\na sudden broil. Nothing of this could have occurred without the habit\r\nof wearing arms, which was a fashion. Out of this came the _Dance of\r\nDeath_.\r\n\r\nThis pernicious influence is illustrated by Judge Jay with admirable\r\nplainness. He shows the individual as an example to nations. Listen, a\r\nmoment, to what he says so well. \"The expert swordsman, the practised\r\nmarksman, is ever more ready to engage in personal combats than the man\r\nwho is unaccustomed to the use of deadly weapons. In those portions of\r\nour country where it is supposed essential to personal safety to go\r\narmed with pistols and bowie-knives mortal affrays are so frequent as\r\nto excite but little attention, and to secure, with exceedingly rare\r\nexceptions, perfect impunity to the murderer; whereas at the North\r\nand East, where we are unprovided with such facilities for taking\r\nlife, comparatively few murders of the kind are perpetrated. We might,\r\nindeed, safely submit the decision of the principle we are discussing\r\nto the calculations of pecuniary interest. Let two men, equal in age\r\nand health, apply for an insurance on their lives,--one known to be\r\never armed to defend his honor and his life against every assailant,\r\nand the other a meek, unresisting Quaker: can we doubt for a moment\r\nwhich of these men would be deemed by an Insurance Company most likely\r\nto reach a good old age?\"[94]\r\n\r\n    [94] Address before the American Peace Society, pp. 23, 24.\r\n\r\nWith this practical statement and its strong sense I leave this\r\nobjection to War Preparations, adding a single supplementary\r\nremark,--What is good for the individual is good for nations.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ objection, though different in character, is not less\r\noperative. It is founded on that law of human nature according to\r\nwhich the very hate or distrust to which these Preparations testify\r\nexcites in others a corresponding sentiment. This law is general and\r\nfundamental. Though rarely recognized by nations as a rule of conduct,\r\nit was never without its influence on individuals. Indeed, it is little\r\nmore than a practical illustration of the Horatian adage, _Si vis me\r\nflere, dolendum est primum ipsi tibi_: If you wish me to weep, you must\r\nyourself first grieve. Nobody questions its truth or applicability. But\r\ndoes it not proclaim that War Preparations in a period of professed\r\nPeace must naturally prompt adverse Preparations, and everywhere within\r\nthe circle of their influence quicken the Spirit of War? So are we all\r\nknit together that the feelings in our own bosoms awaken corresponding\r\nfeelings in the bosoms of others,--as harp answers to harp in its\r\nsoftest vibration, as deep responds to deep in the might of its power.\r\nWhat in us is good invites the good in our brother; generosity begets\r\ngenerosity; love wins love; Peace secures Peace;--while all in us that\r\nis bad challenges the bad in our brother; distrust engenders distrust;\r\nhate provokes hate; War arouses War. Therefore are we admonished to\r\navoid such appeal, and this is the voice of Nature itself.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful law is everywhere. The wretched maniac, in whose\r\nmind the common principles of conduct are overthrown, confesses its\r\noverruling power; and the vacant stare of madness is illumined by a\r\nword of love. The wild beasts confess it: and what is the story of\r\nOrpheus, whose music drew in listening rapture the lions and panthers\r\nof the forest, or of St. Jerome, whose kindness soothed the lion to lie\r\ndown at his feet, but expressions of its prevailing power?[95]\r\n\r\n[95] Scholars will remember the incident recorded by Homer in the\r\nOdyssey (XIV. 30, 31), where Ulysses, on reaching his loved Ithaca, is\r\nbeset by dogs, described as wild beasts in ferocity, who rush towards\r\nhim barking; but he, with _craft_ (that is the word of Homer), seats\r\nhimself upon the ground _and lets his staff fall from his hand_. A\r\nsimilar incident is noticed by Mr. Mure, in his entertaining travels in\r\nGreece, and also by Mr. Borrow, in his \"Bible in Spain.\" Pliny remarks,\r\nthat all dogs may be appeased in the same way: \"_Impetus eorum et\r\nsævitia mitigatur ab homine considente humi._\" Nat. Hist., Lib. VIII.\r\ncap. 40.\r\n\r\nEven a fable may testify. I would not be tempted too far, but, at the\r\nrisk of protracting this discussion, I cannot forget illustrations\r\nwhich show how poetry at least, if not history, has interpreted the\r\nheart of man.\r\n\r\nLooking back to the historic dawn, one of the most touching scenes\r\nillumined by that auroral light is the peaceful visit of the aged\r\nPriam to the tent of Achilles, entreating the body of his son. The\r\nfierce combat ended in the death of Hector, whose unhonored corse the\r\nbloody Greek has trailed behind his chariot. After twelve days of\r\ngrief, the venerable father is moved to seek the remains of the son\r\nhe has so dearly loved. He leaves his lofty cedarn chamber, and with\r\na single aged attendant, unarmed, repairs to the Grecian camp beside\r\nthe distant sounding sea. Entering alone, he finds Achilles in his\r\ntent, with two of his chiefs. Grasping his knees, the father kisses\r\nthose terrible homicidal hands which had taken the life of his son.\r\nTouched by the sight which he beholds, the heart of the inflamed, the\r\nangry, the inflexible Achilles responds to the feelings of Priam.\r\nHe takes the suppliant by the hand, seats him by his side, consoles\r\nhis grief, refreshes his weary body, and concedes to the prayers of\r\na weak, unarmed old man what all Troy in arms could not win. In this\r\nscene, which fills a large space in the Iliad,[96] the master poet,\r\nwith unconscious power, has presented a picture of the omnipotence of\r\nthat law, making all mankind of kin, in obedience to which no word of\r\nkindness, no act of confidence, falls idly to the earth.\r\n\r\n    [96] Book XXIV.\r\n\r\nAmong the early passages of Roman history, perhaps none makes a deeper\r\nimpression than that scene, after the Roman youth were consumed at\r\nthe Allia, and the invading Gauls under Brennus had entered the city,\r\nwhere in a temple were seated the venerable Senators of the Republic,\r\ntoo old to flee, and careless of surviving the Roman name, each on\r\nhis curule chair, unarmed, looking, as Livy says, more august than\r\nmortal, and with the majesty of the gods. The Gauls gaze as upon sacred\r\nimages; and the hand of slaughter, which had raged through the streets\r\nof Rome, is stayed by the sight of an unarmed assembly. This continued\r\nuntil one of the invaders standing nearest reached his hand to stroke\r\ngently the silver beard of a Senator, who, indignant at the license,\r\nsmote the barbarian with his ivory staff, which was the signal for\r\ngeneral vengeance. Think you that a band of savages could have slain\r\nthese Senators, if the _appeal to Force_ had not been made first by one\r\nof their own number? This story, though recounted by Livy, and also\r\nby Plutarch,[97] is repudiated by Niebuhr; but it is none the less\r\ninteresting as a legend, attesting the law by which hostile feelings\r\nare aroused or subdued.\r\n\r\n    [97] Liv., Lib. V. cap. 41. Plutarch, Life of Camillus.\r\n\r\nThis great scene, in its essential parts, has been repeated in another\r\nage and country. The theatre was an African wilderness, with Christian\r\nconverts for Roman Senators. The little band, with their pastor, who\r\nwas a local chief, assembled on a Sabbath morning for prayer, when\r\nsuddenly robbers came upon them, as the Gauls upon Rome, and demanded\r\ncattle. The pastor, asking his people to sit still, calmly pointed to\r\nthe cattle, and then turned back to unite with the rest in prayer. The\r\nrobbers, like the Gauls, looked on in silence, awed into forbearance,\r\nuntil they quietly withdrew, injuring nobody and touching nothing. Such\r\nan instance, which is derived from the report of missionaries,[98]\r\ntestifies again to the might of meekness, and proves that the Roman\r\nstory, though reduced to the condition of a legend, is in harmony with\r\nactual life.\r\n\r\n    [98] Moffat, Missionary Labors and Scenes in Southern Africa, Ch. 32.\r\n\r\nAn admired picture by Virgil, in his melodious epic, furnishes similar\r\ntestimony. The Trojan fleet, beaten by tempest on the raging waves,\r\nis about to succumb, when the God of the Sea, suddenly appearing in\r\ntranquil power, stills the hostile elements, as a man venerable for\r\npiety and deserts by a gentle word assuages a furious populace just\r\nbreaking into sedition and outrage.[99] The sea and the populace were\r\nequally appeased. Alike in the god and the man was the same peaceful\r\npresence. Elsewhere is this same influence. Guizot, illustrates\r\nthis same influence, when, describing the development of mediæval\r\ncivilization, he exhibits an angry multitude subdued by an unarmed\r\nman, employing the _word_ instead of the _sword_.[100] And surely no\r\nreader of that noble historical romance, the _Promessi Sposi_, can\r\nforget that finest scene, where Frà Cristoforo, in an age of violence,\r\nafter slaying his comrade in a broil, presents himself unarmed and\r\npenitent before the family and retainers of his victim, and by\r\ndignified gentleness awakens the admiration of men raging against him.\r\nBoth hemispheres are at this moment occupied with the popular romance,\r\n_Le Juif Errant_, by Eugène Sue, where is an interesting picture of\r\nChristian courage superior to the trained violence of the soldier.\r\nAnother example, made familiar by recent translations of _Frithiof's\r\nSaga_, the Swedish epic,[101] is more emphatic. The scene is a battle.\r\nFrithiof is in deadly combat with Atlé, when the falchion of the latter\r\nbreaks. Throwing away his own weapon, Frithiof says,--\r\n\r\n    \"_Swordless foeman's life\r\n     Ne'er dyed this gallant blade._\"\r\n\r\n    [99] \"Ille regit dictis animos et pectora mulcet.\"\r\n\r\n_Æneid_, I. 146-154.\r\n\r\n    [100] Guizot, Histoire de la Civilisation en France, Tom. II. p. 36.\r\n\r\n    [101] Longfellow, Poets and Poetry of Europe, p. 161: Tegnér.\r\n\r\nThe two champions now close in mutual clutch; they hug like bears, says\r\nthe poet.\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis o'er; for Frithiof's matchless strength\r\n     Has felled his ponderous size,\r\n     And 'neath that knee, a giant length,\r\n     Supine the Viking lies.\r\n     'But fails my sword, thou Berserk swart,'\r\n     The voice rang far and wide,\r\n     'Its point should pierce thy inmost heart,\r\n     Its hilt should drink the tide.'\r\n     'Be free to lift the weaponed hand,'\r\n     Undaunted Atlé spoke;\r\n     Hence, fearless, quest thy distant brand:\r\n     Thus I abide the stroke.'\"\r\n\r\nFrithiof regains his sword, intent to close the dread debate, while his\r\nadversary awaits the stroke; but his heart responds to the generous\r\ncourage of his foe; he cannot injure one who has shown such confidence\r\nin him.\r\n\r\n    \"_This quelled his ire, this checked his arm,\r\n     Outstretched the hand of peace._\"\r\n\r\nI cannot leave these illustrations without alluding again to the\r\ntreatment of the insane, teaching, by conclusive example, how strong\r\nin Nature must be the responsive principle. On proposing to remove\r\nthe heavy chains from the raving maniacs of the Paris hospitals,\r\nthe benevolent Pinel was regarded as one who saw visions or dreamed\r\ndreams. At last his wishes were gratified. The change in the patients\r\nwas immediate; the wrinkled front of warring passion was smoothed\r\ninto the serene countenance of Peace. The treatment by Force is now\r\nuniversally abandoned; the law of kindness takes its place; and these\r\nunfortunates mingle together, unvexed by restraints implying suspicion,\r\nand therefore arousing opposition. What an example to nations, who are\r\nlittle better than insane! The ancient hospitals, with their violent\r\nmadness, making confusion and strife, are a dark, but feeble, type of\r\nthe Christian nations, obliged to wear the intolerable chains of War,\r\nassimilating the world to one great mad-house; while the peace and\r\ngood-will now abounding in these retreats are the happy emblems of what\r\nawaits mankind when at last we practically recognize the supremacy of\r\nthose higher sentiments which are at once a strength and a charm,--\r\n\r\n    \"making their future might\r\n     Magnetic o'er the fixed, untrembling heart.\"\r\n\r\nI might dwell also on recent experience, so full of delightful wisdom,\r\nin the treatment of the distant, degraded convict of New South Wales,\r\nshowing how confidence and kindness on the part of overseers awaken a\r\ncorresponding sentiment even in outcasts, from whose souls virtue seems\r\nblotted out.\r\n\r\nThus, from all quarters and sources--the far-off Past, the far-away\r\nPacific, the verse of the poet, the legend of history, the cell of the\r\nmad-house, the congregation of transported criminals, the experience of\r\ndaily life, the universal heart of man--ascends spontaneous tribute to\r\nthat law according to which we respond to the sentiments by which we\r\nare addressed, whether of love or hate, of confidence or distrust.\r\n\r\nIf it be urged that these instances are exceptional, I reply at once,\r\nthat it is not so. They are indubitable evidence of the real man,\r\nrevealing the divinity of Humanity, out of which goodness, happiness,\r\ntrue greatness can alone proceed. They disclose susceptibilities\r\nconfined to no particular race, no special period of time, no narrow\r\ncircle of knowledge or refinement, but present wherever two or more\r\nhuman beings come together, and strong in proportion to their virtue\r\nand intelligence. Therefore on the nature of man, as impregnable\r\nground, do I place the fallacy of this most costly and pernicious\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\nNor is Human Nature the only witness: Christianity testifies in\r\nfamiliar texts, and then again by holiest lips. Augustine, in one of\r\nhis persuasive letters, protests, with proverbial heart of flame,\r\n_against turning Peace into a Preparation for War_, and then tells the\r\nsoldier whom he addresses to be _pacific even in war_.[102] From the\r\nreligion of his Master the great Christian saint had learned that Love\r\nis more puissant than Force. To the reflecting mind, the Omnipotence\r\nof God himself is less discernible in earthquake and storm than in\r\nthe gentle, but quickening, rays of the sun, and the sweet descending\r\ndews. He is a careless observer who does not recognize the superiority\r\nof gentleness and kindness in exercising influence or securing rights\r\namong men. As the storms of violence beat upon us, we hug mantles\r\ngladly thrown aside under the warmth of a genial sun.\r\n\r\n    [102] \"Non enim pax quæritur ut bellum excitetur.... Esto ergo etiam\r\nbellando pacificus.\"--Augustini Epistola CCV., ad Bonifacium Comitem:\r\nOpera, Tom. II. p. 318.\r\n\r\nChristianity not only teaches the superiority of Love to Force, it\r\npositively enjoins the practice of the former, as a constant, primal\r\nduty. It says, \"Love your neighbors\"; but it does not say, \"In time\r\nof Peace rear the massive fortification, build the man-of-war, enlist\r\nstanding armies, train militia, and accumulate military stores, to\r\noverawe and menace your neighbor.\" It directs that we should do to\r\nothers as we would have them do to us,--a golden rule for all; but how\r\ninconsistent is that distrust in obedience to which nations professing\r\npeace sleep like soldiers on their arms! Nor is this all. Its precepts\r\ninculcate patience, forbearance, forgiveness of evil, even the duty\r\nof benefiting a destroyer, \"as the sandal-wood, in the instant of its\r\noverthrow, sheds perfume on the axe which fells it.\" Can a people in\r\nwhom this faith is more than an idle word authorize such enormous\r\nsacrifices to pamper the Spirit of War? Thus far nations have drawn\r\ntheir weapons from earthly armories, unmindful that there are others of\r\ncelestial temper.\r\n\r\nThe injunction, \"Love one another,\" is as applicable to nations as to\r\nindividuals. It is one of the great laws of Heaven. And nations, like\r\nindividuals, may well measure their nearness to God and to his glory by\r\nthe conformity of their conduct to this duty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn response to arguments founded on economy, the true nature of man,\r\nand Christianity, I hear the skeptical note of some advocate of the\r\ntransmitted order of things, some one among the \"fire-worshippers\" of\r\nWar, saying, All this is beautiful, but visionary; it is in advance\r\nof the age, which is not yet prepared for the great change. To such\r\nI answer: Nothing can be beautiful that is not true; but all this is\r\ntrue, and the time has come for its acceptance. Now is the dawning day,\r\nand now the fitting hour.\r\n\r\nThe name of Washington is invoked as authority for a prejudice which\r\nEconomy, Human Nature, and Christianity repudiate. Mighty and reverend\r\nas is his name, more mighty and more reverend is Truth. The words\r\nof counsel which he gave were in accordance with the spirit of his\r\nage,--which was not shocked by the slave-trade. But his great soul,\r\nwhich loved virtue and inculcated justice and benevolence, frowns upon\r\nthose who would use his authority as an incentive to War. God forbid\r\nthat his sacred character should be profanely stretched, like the skin\r\nof John Ziska, on a militia-drum, to arouse the martial ardor of the\r\nAmerican people!\r\n\r\nThe practice of Washington, during the eight years of his\r\nadministration, compared with that of the last eight years for which we\r\nhave the returns, may explain his real opinions. His condemnation of\r\nthe present wasteful system speaks to us from the following table.[103]\r\n\r\n    [103] Executive Document No. 15, Twenty-eighth Congress, First Session.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+----------------+---------------+\r\n  |         Years.       |   Military     |     Naval     |\r\n  |                      | Establishment. | Establishment.|\r\n  +----------------------+----------------+---------------+\r\n  |         1789-91      |     $835,618   |         $570  |\r\n  |         1792         |    1,223,594   |           53! |\r\n  |         1793         |    1,237,620   |               |\r\n  |         1794         |    2,733,539   |       61,409  |\r\n  |         1795         |    2,573,059   |      410,562  |\r\n  |         1796         |    1,474,672   |      274,784  |\r\n  | Total, during eight  |}  -----------  |     --------  |\r\n  | years of Washington, |}  $10,078,102  |     $747,378  |\r\n  |                      |                |               |\r\n  |         1835         |    $9,420,313  |   $3,864,939  |\r\n  |         1836         |    19,667,166  |    5,807,718  |\r\n  |         1837         |    20,702,929  |    6,646,915  |\r\n  |         1838         |    20,557,473  |    6,131,581  |\r\n  |         1839         |    14,588,664  |    6,182,294  |\r\n  |         1840         |    12,030,624  |    6,113,897  |\r\n  |         1841         |    13,704,882  |    6,001,077  |\r\n  |         1842         |     9,188,469  |    8,397,243  |\r\n  |                      |                |               |\r\n  | Total, during eight  |} ------------  |  -----------  |\r\n  |   recent years,      |} $119,860,520  |  $49,145,664  |\r\n  +----------------------+----------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nThus the expenditures for the national armaments under the sanction\r\nof Washington were less than _eleven million_ dollars, while during\r\na recent similar period of eight years they amounted to upwards of\r\n_one hundred and sixty-nine millions_,--an increase of nearly _fifteen\r\nhundred per cent_! To him who quotes the precept of Washington I\r\ncommend the example. He must be strongly possessed by the martial mania\r\nwho will not confess, that, in this age, when the whole world is at\r\npeace, and our national power is assured, _there is less need_ of these\r\nPreparations than in an age convulsed with War, when our national power\r\nwas little respected. The only semblance of argument in their favor\r\nis the increased wealth of the country; but the capacity to endure\r\ntaxation is no criterion of its justice, or even of its expediency.\r\n\r\nAnother fallacy is also invoked, that _whatever is is right_. A\r\nbarbarous practice is elevated above all those authorities by which\r\nthese Preparations are condemned. We are made to count principles\r\nas nothing, because not yet recognized by nations. But they are\r\npractically applied in the relations of individuals, towns, counties,\r\nand states in our Union. _All these have disarmed._ It remains only\r\nthat they should be extended to the grander sphere of nations. Be it\r\nour duty to proclaim the principles, whatever the practice. Through us\r\nlet Truth speak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the past and the present auspicious omens cheer us for the future.\r\nThe terrible wars of the French Revolution were the violent rending of\r\nthe body preceding the exorcism of the fiend. Since the morning stars\r\nfirst sang together, the world has not witnessed a peace so harmonious\r\nand enduring as that which now blesses the Christian nations. Great\r\nquestions, fraught with strife, and in another age heralds of War, are\r\nnow determined by Mediation or Arbitration. Great political movements,\r\nwhich a few short years ago must have led to bloody encounter, are\r\nnow conducted by peaceful discussion. Literature, the press, and\r\ninnumerable societies, all join in the work of inculcating good-will\r\nto man. The Spirit of Humanity pervades the best writings, whether the\r\nelevated philosophical inquiries of the \"Vestiges of the Creation,\" the\r\ningenious, but melancholy, moralizings of the \"Story of a Feather,\" or\r\nthe overflowing raillery of \"Punch.\" Nor can the breathing thought and\r\nburning word of poet or orator have a higher inspiration. Genius is\r\nnever so Promethean as when it bears the heavenly fire to the hearths\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nIn the last age, Dr. Johnson uttered the detestable sentiment, that\r\nhe liked \"a good Hater.\" The man of this age will say that he likes\r\n\"a good Lover.\" Thus reversing the objects of regard, he follows a\r\nhigher wisdom and a purer religion than the renowned moralist knew.\r\nHe recognizes that peculiar Heaven-born sentiment, the Brotherhood of\r\nMan, soon to become the decisive touchstone of human institutions. He\r\nconfesses the power of Love, destined to enter more and more into the\r\nconcerns of life. And as Love is more heavenly than Hate, so must its\r\ninfluence redound more to the true glory of man and the approval of\r\nGod. A Christian poet--whose few verses bear him with unflagging wing\r\nin immortal flight--has joined this sentiment with Prayer. Thus he\r\nspeaks, in words of uncommon pathos and power:--\r\n\r\n    \"He prayeth well who loveth well\r\n     Both man and bird and beast.\r\n\r\n     \"He prayeth best who loveth best\r\n     All things, both great and small;\r\n     For the dear God who loveth us,\r\n     He made and loveth all.\"[104]\r\n\r\n    [104] Coleridge, Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Part VII.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Law of Hate is yielding to the Law of Love. It is seen in\r\nmanifold labors of philanthropy and in missions of charity. It is seen\r\nin institutions for the insane, the blind, the deaf, the dumb, the\r\npoor, the outcast,--in generous efforts to relieve those who are in\r\nprison,--in public schools, opening the gates of knowledge to all the\r\nchildren of the land. It is seen in the diffusive amenities of social\r\nlife, and in the increasing fellowship of nations; also in the rising\r\nopposition to Slavery and to War.\r\n\r\nThere are yet other special auguries of this great change,\r\nauspicating, in the natural progress of man, the abandonment of all\r\ninternational Preparations for War. To these I allude briefly, but with\r\na deep conviction of their significance.\r\n\r\nLook at the Past, and see how War itself is changed, so that its\r\noldest \"fire-worshipper\" would hardly know it. At first nothing but\r\nsavagery, with disgusting rites, whether in the North American Indian\r\nwith Powhatan as chief, or the earlier Assyrian with Nebuchadnezzar as\r\nking, but yielding gradually to the influence of civilization. With the\r\nGreeks it was less savage, but always barbarous,--also with Rome always\r\nbarbarous. Too slowly Christianity exerted a humanizing power. Rabelais\r\nrelates how the friar Jean des Entommeures clubbed twelve thousand\r\nand more enemies, \"without mentioning women and children, which is\r\nunderstood always.\" But this was War, as seen by that great genius in\r\nhis day. This can be no longer. Women and children are safe now. The\r\ndivine metamorphosis has begun.\r\n\r\nLook again at the Past, and observe the _change in dress_. Down to a\r\nperiod quite recent the sword was the indispensable companion of the\r\ngentleman, wherever he appeared, whether in street or society; but he\r\nwould be deemed madman or bully who should wear it now. At an earlier\r\nperiod the armor of complete steel was the habiliment of the knight.\r\nFrom the picturesque sketch by Sir Walter Scott, in the \"Lay of the\r\nLast Minstrel,\" we learn the barbarous constraint of this custom.\r\n\r\n    \"Ten of them were sheathed in steel,\r\n     With belted sword, and spur on heel;\r\n     They quitted not their harness bright,\r\n     Neither by day nor yet by night:\r\n\r\n     They lay down to rest\r\n     With corslet laced,\r\n     Pillowed on buckler cold and hard;\r\n     They carved at the meal\r\n     With gloves of steel,\r\n     And they drank the red wine through the helmet barred.\"\r\n\r\nBut all this is changed now.\r\n\r\nObserve the _change in architecture and in domestic life_. Places\r\nonce chosen for castles or houses were savage, inaccessible retreats,\r\nwhere the massive structure was reared to repel attack and to enclose\r\nits inhabitants. Even monasteries and churches were fortified,\r\nand girdled by towers, ramparts, and ditches,--while a child was\r\nstationed as watchman, to observe what passed at a distance, and\r\nannounce the approach of an enemy. Homes of peaceful citizens in\r\ntowns were castellated, often without so much as an aperture for\r\nlight near the ground, but with loopholes through which the shafts\r\nof the crossbow were aimed. The colored plates now so common, from\r\nmediæval illustrations, especially of Froissart, exhibit these\r\n_belligerent armaments_, always so burdensome. From a letter of\r\nMargaret Paston, in the time of Henry the Sixth, of England, I draw\r\nsupplementary testimony. Addressing in dutiful phrase her \"right\r\nworshipful husband,\" she asks him to procure for her \"some crossbows,\r\nand wyndacs [grappling-irons] to bind them with, and quarrels [arrows\r\nwith square heads],\" also \"two or three short pole-axes to keep within\r\ndoors\"; and she tells her absent lord of apparent preparations by a\r\nneighbor,--\"great ordnance within the house,\" \"bars to bar the door\r\ncrosswise,\" and \"wickets on every quarter of the house to shoot out at,\r\nboth with bows and with hand-guns.\"[105] Savages could hardly live in\r\ngreater distrust. Let now the Poet of Chivalry describe another scene:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ten squires, ten yeomen, mail-clad men,\r\n     Waited the beck of the warders ten;\r\n     Thirty steeds, both fleet and wight,\r\n     Stood saddled in stable day and night,\r\n     Barbed with frontlet of steel, I trow,\r\n     And with Jedwood axe at saddle-bow;\r\n     A hundred more fed free in stall:\r\n     Such was the custom of Branksome Hall.\"\r\n\r\n    [105] Paston Letters, CXIII. (LXXVII. Vol. III. p. 315.)\r\n\r\nThis also is all changed now.\r\n\r\nThe principles causing this change are not only active still, but\r\nincreasing in activity; nor can they be confined to individuals.\r\nNations must soon declare them, and, abandoning martial habiliments and\r\nfortifications, enter upon peaceful, _unarmed life_. With shame let it\r\nbe said, that they continue to live in the very relations of distrust\r\ntowards neighbors which shock us in the knights of Branksome Hall, and\r\nin the house of Margaret Paston. They pillow themselves on \"buckler\r\ncold and hard,\" while their highest anxiety and largest expenditure\r\nare for the accumulation of new munitions of War. The barbarism which\r\nindividuals have renounced nations still cherish. So doing, they take\r\ncounsel of the wild-boar in the fable, who whetted his tusks on a tree\r\nof the forest when no enemy was near, saying, that in time of Peace he\r\nmust prepare for War. Has not the time come, when man, whom God created\r\nin his own image, and to whom he gave the Heaven-directed countenance,\r\nshall cease to look down to the beast for an example of conduct? Nay,\r\nlet me not dishonor the beasts by the comparison. The superior animals,\r\nat least, prey not, like men, upon their own species. The kingly lion\r\nturns from his brother lion; the ferocious tiger will not raven upon\r\nhis kindred tiger; the wild-boar of the forest does not glut his\r\nsharpened tusks upon a kindred boar.\r\n\r\n    \"Sed jam serpentum major concordia: parcit\r\n     Cognatis maculis similis fera: quando leoni\r\n     Fortior eripuit vitam leo? quo nemore unquam\r\n     Exspiravit aper majoris dentibus apri?\r\n     Indica tigris agit rabida cum tigride _pacem\r\n     Perpetuam_.\"[106]\r\n\r\n    [106] Juvenal, Sat. XV. 159-164.\r\n\r\nTo an early monarch of France just homage has been offered for effort\r\nin the cause of Peace, particularly in abolishing the Trial by Battle.\r\nTo another monarch of France, in our own day, descendant of St. Louis,\r\nand lover of Peace worthy of the illustrious lineage, Louis Philippe,\r\nbelongs the honest fame of first from the throne publishing the truth\r\nthat Peace is endangered by Preparations for War. \"The sentiment, or\r\nrather the principle,\" he says, in reply to an address from the London\r\nPeace Convention in 1843, \"that in Peace you must prepare for War,\r\n_is one of difficulty and danger; for while we keep armies on land to\r\npreserve peace, they are at the same time incentives and instruments\r\nof war_. He rejoiced in all efforts to preserve peace, for that was\r\nwhat all needed. He thought the time was coming when we should get\r\nrid entirely of war in all civilized countries.\" This time has been\r\nhailed by a generous voice from the Army itself, by a Marshal of\r\nFrance,--Bugeaud, the Governor of Algiers,--who, at a public dinner\r\nin Paris, gave as a toast these words of salutation to a new and\r\napproaching era of happiness: \"To the pacific union of the great human\r\nfamily, by the association of individuals, nations, and races! To the\r\nannihilation of War! To the transformation of destructive armies into\r\ncorps of industrious laborers, who will consecrate their lives to\r\nthe cultivation and embellishment of the world!\" Be it our duty to\r\nspeed this consummation! And may other soldiers emulate the pacific\r\naspiration of this veteran chief, until _the trade of War_ ceases from\r\nthe earth![107]\r\n\r\n    [107] There was a moment when the aspiration of the French marshal\r\nseemed fulfilled even in France, if we may credit the early Madame de\r\nLafayette, who, in the first sentence of her Memoirs, announces perfect\r\ntranquillity, where \"no other arms were known than instruments for the\r\ncultivation of the earth and for building, and the troops were employed\r\non these things.\" Part of their work was to divert the waters of the\r\nEure, so that the fountains at Versailles should have a perpetual\r\nsupply: but this was better than War.--MADAME DE LAFAYETTE, _Mémoires\r\nde la Cour de France pour les Années 1688 et 1689_, p. 1.\r\n\r\nTo William Penn belongs the distinction, destined to brighten as men\r\nadvance in virtue, of first in human history establishing the _Law\r\nof Love_ as a rule of conduct in the intercourse of nations. While\r\nrecognizing the duty \"to support power in reverence with the people,\r\nand to secure the people from the abuse of power,\"[108] as a great\r\nend of government, he declined the superfluous protection of arms\r\nagainst foreign force, and aimed to \"reduce the savage nations by just\r\nand gentle manners to the love of civil society and the Christian\r\nreligion.\" His serene countenance, as he stands with his followers in\r\nwhat he called the sweet and clear air of Pennsylvania, all unarmed,\r\nbeneath the spreading elm, forming the great treaty of friendship with\r\nthe untutored Indians,--whose savage display fills the surrounding\r\nforest as far as the eye can reach,--not to wrest their lands by\r\nviolence, but to obtain them by peaceful purchase,--is to my mind the\r\nproudest picture in the history of our country. \"The great God,\" said\r\nthe illustrious Quaker, in words of sincerity and truth addressed to\r\nthe Sachems, \"hath written his law in our hearts, by which we are\r\ntaught and commanded to love and help and do good to one another. It\r\nis not our custom to use hostile weapons against our fellow-creatures,\r\nfor which reason we come unarmed. Our object is not to do injury, but\r\nto do good. We are now met on the broad pathway of good faith and good\r\nwill, so that no advantage is to be taken on either side, but all is\r\nto be openness, brotherhood, and love, while all are to be treated as\r\nof the same flesh and blood.\"[109] These are words of True Greatness.\r\n\"Without any carnal weapons,\" says one of his companions, \"we entered\r\nthe land, and inhabited therein, as safe as if there had been thousands\r\nof garrisons.\" What a sublime attestation! \"This little State,\" says\r\nOldmixon, \"subsisted in the midst of six Indian nations without so\r\nmuch as a militia for its defence.\" A great man worthy of the mantle\r\nof Penn, the venerable philanthropist, Clarkson, in his life of the\r\nfounder, pictures the people of Pennsylvania as armed, though without\r\narms,--strong, though without strength,--safe, without the ordinary\r\nmeans of safety. According to him, the constable's staff was the only\r\ninstrument of authority for the greater part of a century; and never,\r\nduring the administration of Penn, or that of his proper successors,\r\nwas there a quarrel or a war.[110]\r\n\r\n    [108] Preface to Penn's Frame of Government of the Province of\r\nPennsylvania: Hazard's Register of Pennsylvania, Vol. I. p. 338. See\r\nalso Clarkson's Memoirs of Penn, Vol. I. p. 238, Philadelphia, 1814.\r\n\r\n    [109] Clarkson's Memoirs of Penn, Vol. I. Ch. 18.\r\n\r\n    [110] Ibid., Vol. II. Ch. 23.\r\n\r\nGreater than the divinity that doth hedge a king is the divinity that\r\nencompasses the righteous man and the righteous people. The flowers of\r\nprosperity smiled in the footprints of William Penn. His people were\r\nunmolested and happy, while (sad, but true contrast!) other colonies,\r\nacting upon the policy of the world, building forts, and showing\r\nthemselves in arms, were harassed by perpetual alarm, and pierced by\r\nthe sharp arrows of savage war.\r\n\r\nThis pattern of a Christian commonwealth never fails to arrest the\r\nadmiration of all who contemplate its beauties. It drew an epigram of\r\neulogy from the caustic pen of Voltaire, and has been fondly painted by\r\nsympathetic historians. Every ingenuous soul in our day offers willing\r\ntribute to those graces of justice and humanity, by the side of which\r\ncontemporary life on this continent seems coarse and earthy.\r\n\r\nNot to barren words can we confine ourselves in recognition of virtue.\r\nWhile we see the right, and approve it too, we must dare to pursue it.\r\nNow, in this age of civilization, surrounded by Christian nations, it\r\nis easy to follow the successful example of William Penn encompassed\r\nby savages. Recognizing those two transcendent ordinances of God, the\r\n_Law of Right_ and the _Law of Love_,--twin suns which illumine the\r\nmoral universe,--why not aspire to the true glory, and, what is higher\r\nthan glory, the great good, of taking the lead in _the disarming of the\r\nnations_? Let us abandon the system of Preparations for War in time\r\nof Peace, as irrational, unchristian, vainly prodigal of expense, and\r\nhaving a direct tendency to excite the evil against which it professes\r\nto guard. Let the enormous means thus released from iron hands be\r\ndevoted to labors of beneficence. Our battlements shall be schools,\r\nhospitals, colleges, and churches; our arsenals shall be libraries; our\r\nnavy shall be peaceful ships, on errands of perpetual commerce; our\r\narmy shall be the teachers of youth and the ministers of religion. This\r\nis the cheap defence of nations. In such intrenchments what Christian\r\nsoul can be touched with fear? Angels of the Lord will throw over the\r\nland an invisible, but impenetrable panoply:--\r\n\r\n    \"Or if Virtue feeble were,\r\n     Heaven itself would stoop to her.\"[111]\r\n\r\n    [111] These are the concluding words of that most exquisite creation\r\nof early genius, the \"Comus.\" Beyond their intrinsic value, they have\r\nauthority from the circumstance that they were adopted by Milton as a\r\nmotto, and inscribed by him in an album at Geneva, while on his foreign\r\ntravels. This album is now in my hands. The truth thus embalmed by the\r\ngrandest poet of modern times is also illustrated in familiar words by\r\nthe most graceful poet of antiquity:--\r\n\r\n\"Integer vitæ scelerisque purus Non eget Mauris jaculis, neque arcu,\r\nNec venenatis gravida sagittis, Fusce, pharetra.\"\r\n\r\nHOR., _Carm._ I. xxii. 1-4.\r\n\r\nDryden pictures the same in some of his most magical lines:--\r\n\r\n\"A milk-white hind, immortal and unchanged, Fed on the lawns, and in\r\nthe forest ranged; Without unspotted, innocent within, _She feared no\r\ndanger, for she knew no sin_.\"\r\n\r\n_The Hind and the Panther_, Part I. 1-4.\r\n\r\nAt the thought of such a change, the imagination loses itself in\r\nvain effort to follow the multitudinous streams of happiness which\r\ngush forth from a thousand hills. Then shall the naked be clothed\r\nand the hungry fed; institutions of science and learning shall crown\r\nevery hill-top; hospitals for the sick, and other retreats for the\r\nunfortunate children of the world, for all who suffer in any way, in\r\nmind, body, or estate, shall nestle in every valley; while the spires\r\nof new churches leap exulting to the skies. The whole land shall\r\ntestify to the change. Art shall confess it in the new inspiration of\r\nthe canvas and the marble. The harp of the poet shall proclaim it in\r\na loftier rhyme. Above all, the heart of man shall bear witness to it,\r\nin the elevation of his sentiments, in the expansion of his affections,\r\nin his devotion to the highest truth, in his appreciation of true\r\ngreatness. The eagle of our country, without the terror of his beak,\r\nand dropping the forceful thunderbolt from his pounces, shall soar,\r\nwith the olive of Peace, into untried realms of ether, nearer to the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI pause to review the field over which we have passed. We have beheld\r\nWar, sanctioned by International Law as a mode of determining _justice_\r\nbetween nations, elevated into an _established custom_, defined and\r\nguarded by a complex code known as the Laws of War; we have detected\r\nits origin in an appeal, not to the moral and intellectual part of\r\nman's nature, in which alone is Justice, but to that low part which\r\nhe has in common with the beast; we have contemplated its infinite\r\nmiseries to the human race; we have weighed its sufficiency as a\r\nmode of determining justice between nations, and found that it is\r\na rude invocation to force, or a gigantic game of chance, in which\r\nGod's children are profanely treated as a pack of cards, while, in\r\nunnatural wickedness, it is justly likened to the monstrous and impious\r\ncustom of Trial by Battle, which disgraced the Dark Ages,--thus\r\nshowing, that, in this day of boastful civilization, justice between\r\nnations is determined by the same rules of barbarous, brutal\r\nviolence which once controlled the relations between individuals.\r\nWe have next considered the various prejudices by which War is\r\nsustained, founded on a false belief in its necessity,--the practice\r\nof nations, past and present,--the infidelity of the Christian\r\nChurch,--a mistaken sentiment of honor,--an exaggerated idea of the\r\nduties of patriotism,--and finally, that monster prejudice which\r\ndraws its vampire life from the vast Preparations for War in time\r\nof Peace;--especially dwelling, at this stage, upon the thriftless,\r\nirrational, and unchristian character of these Preparations,--hailing\r\nalso the auguries of their overthrow,--and catching a vision of the\r\nsurpassing good that will be achieved, when the boundless means thus\r\nbarbarously employed are dedicated to works of Peace, opening the\r\nserene path to that righteousness which exalteth a nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now, if it be asked why, in considering the TRUE GRANDEUR OF\r\nNATIONS, I dwell thus singly and exclusively on War, it is because War\r\nis utterly and irreconcilably inconsistent with True Greatness. Thus\r\nfar, man has worshipped in Military Glory a phantom idol, compared with\r\nwhich the colossal images of ancient Babylon or modern Hindostan are\r\nbut toys; and we, in this favored land of freedom, in this blessed day\r\nof light, are among the idolaters. The Heaven-descended injunction,\r\n_Know thyself_, still speaks to an unheeding world from the far-off\r\nletters of gold at Delphi: _Know thyself; know that the moral is the\r\nnoblest part of man_, transcending far that which is the seat of\r\npassion, strife, and War,--nobler than the intellect itself. And the\r\nhuman heart, in its untutored, spontaneous homage to the virtues of\r\nPeace, declares the same truth,--admonishing the military idolater that\r\nit is not the bloody combats, even of bravest chiefs, even of gods\r\nthemselves, as they echo from the resounding lines of the great Poet\r\nof War, which receive the warmest admiration, but those two scenes\r\nwhere are painted the gentle, unwarlike affections of our nature, the\r\nParting of Hector from Andromache, and the Supplication of Priam. In\r\nthe definitive election of these peaceful pictures, the soul of man,\r\ninspired by a better wisdom than that of books, and drawn unconsciously\r\nby the heavenly attraction of what is truly great, acknowledges, in\r\ntouching instances, the vanity of Military Glory. The Beatitudes\r\nof Christ, which shrink from saying, \"Blessed are the War-makers,\"\r\ninculcate the same lesson. Reason affirms and repeats what the heart\r\nhas prompted and Christianity proclaimed. Suppose War decided by\r\n_Force_, where is the glory? Suppose it decided by _Chance_, where\r\nis the glory? Surely, in other ways True Greatness lies. Nor is it\r\ndifficult to tell where.\r\n\r\nTrue Greatness consists in imitating, as nearly as possible for finite\r\nman, the perfections of an Infinite Creator,--above all, in cultivating\r\nthose highest perfections, Justice and Love: Justice, which, like that\r\nof St. Louis, does not swerve to the right hand or to the left; Love,\r\nwhich, like that of William Penn, regards all mankind as of kin. \"God\r\nis angry,\" says Plato, \"when any one censures a man like Himself, _or\r\npraises a man of an opposite character_: and the godlike man is the\r\ngood man.\"[112] Again, in another of those lovely dialogues precious\r\nwith immortal truth: \"Nothing resembles God more than that man among\r\nus who has attained to the highest degree of justice.\"[113] The True\r\nGreatness of Nations is in those qualities which constitute the\r\ntrue greatness of the individual. It is not in extent of territory,\r\nor vastness of population, or accumulation of wealth,--not in\r\nfortifications, or armies, or navies,--not in the sulphurous blaze\r\nof battle,--not in Golgothas, though covered by monuments that kiss\r\nthe clouds; for all these are creatures and representatives of those\r\nqualities in our nature which are unlike anything in God's nature. Nor\r\nis it in triumphs of the intellect alone,--in literature, learning,\r\nscience, or art. The polished Greeks, our masters in the delights of\r\nart, and the commanding Romans, overawing the earth with their power,\r\nwere little more than splendid savages. And the age of Louis the\r\nFourteenth, of France, spanning so long a period of ordinary worldly\r\nmagnificence, thronged by marshals bending under military laurels,\r\nenlivened by the unsurpassed comedy of Molière, dignified by the\r\ntragic genius of Corneille, illumined by the splendors of Bossuet, is\r\ndegraded by immoralities that cannot be mentioned without a blush, by a\r\nheartlessness in comparison with which the ice of Nova Zembla is warm,\r\nand by a succession of deeds of injustice not to be washed out by the\r\ntears of all the recording angels of Heaven.\r\n\r\n    [112] Minos, § 12.\r\n\r\n    [113] Theætetus, § 85.\r\n\r\nThe True Greatness of a Nation cannot be in triumphs of the intellect\r\nalone. Literature and art may enlarge the sphere of its influence; they\r\nmay adorn it; but in their nature they are but accessaries. _The True\r\nGrandeur of Humanity is in moral elevation, sustained, enlightened, and\r\ndecorated by the intellect of man._ The surest tokens of this grandeur\r\nin a nation are that Christian Beneficence which diffuses the greatest\r\nhappiness among all, and that passionless, godlike Justice which\r\ncontrols the relations of the nation to other nations, and to all the\r\npeople committed to its charge.\r\n\r\nBut War crushes with bloody heel all beneficence, all happiness, all\r\njustice, all that is godlike in man,--suspending every commandment of\r\nthe Decalogue, setting at naught every principle of the Gospel, and\r\nsilencing all law, human as well as divine, except only that impious\r\ncode of its own, the _Laws of War_. If in its dismal annals there\r\nis any cheerful passage, be assured it is not inspired by a martial\r\nFury. Let it not be forgotten, let it be ever borne in mind, as you\r\nponder this theme, that the virtues which shed their charm over its\r\nhorrors are all borrowed of Peace,--that they are emanations from\r\nthe Spirit of Love, which is so strong in the heart of man that it\r\nsurvives the rudest assault. The flowers of gentleness, kindliness,\r\nfidelity, humanity, which flourish unregarded in the rich meadows of\r\nPeace, receive unwonted admiration when we discern them in War,--like\r\nviolets shedding their perfume on the perilous edge of the precipice,\r\nbeyond the smiling borders of civilization. God be praised for all the\r\nexamples of magnanimous virtue which he has vouchsafed to mankind!\r\nGod be praised, that the Roman Emperor, about to start on a distant\r\nexpedition of War, encompassed by squadrons of cavalry, and by golden\r\neagles swaying in the wind, stooped from his saddle to hear the prayer\r\nof a humble widow, demanding justice for the death of her son![114]\r\nGod be praised, that Sidney, on the field of battle, gave with dying\r\nhand the cup of cold water to the dying soldier! That single act of\r\nself-forgetful sacrifice has consecrated the deadly field of Zutphen,\r\nfar, oh, far beyond its battle; it has consecrated thy name, gallant\r\nSidney, beyond any feat of thy sword, beyond any triumph of thy pen!\r\nBut there are lowly suppliants in other places than the camp; there\r\nare hands outstretched elsewhere than on fields of blood. Everywhere\r\nis opportunity for deeds of like charity. Know well that these are not\r\nthe product of War. They do not spring from enmity, hatred, and strife,\r\nbut from those benign sentiments whose natural and ripened fruit of joy\r\nand blessing are found only in Peace. If at any time they appear in the\r\nsoldier, it is less _because_ than _notwithstanding_ he is the hireling\r\nof battle. Let me not be told, then, of the virtues of War. Let not the\r\nacts of generosity and sacrifice sometimes blossoming on its fields\r\nbe invoked in its defence. From such a giant root of bitterness no\r\ntrue good can spring. The poisonous tree, in Oriental imagery, though\r\nwatered by nectar and covered with roses, produces only the fruit of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n    [114] According to the legends of the Catholic Church, this most\r\nadmired instance of justice opened to Trajan, although a heathen, the\r\ngates of salvation. Dante found the scene and the \"visible speech\"\r\nof the widow and Emperor storied on the walls of Purgatory, and has\r\ntransmitted them in a passage which commends itself hardly less than\r\nany in the divine poem.--See _Purgatorio_, Canto X.\r\n\r\nCasting our eyes over the history of nations, with horror we discern\r\nthe succession of murderous slaughters by which their progress is\r\nmarked. Even as the hunter follows the wild beast to his lair by\r\nthe drops of blood on the ground, so we follow Man, faint, weary,\r\nstaggering with wounds, through the Black Forest of the Past, which he\r\nhas reddened with his gore. Oh, let it not be in the future ages as in\r\nthose we now contemplate! Let the grandeur of man be discerned, not\r\nin bloody victory or ravenous conquest, but in the blessings he has\r\nsecured, in the good he has accomplished, in the triumphs of Justice\r\nand Beneficence, in the establishment of Perpetual Peace!\r\n\r\nAs ocean washes every shore, and with all-embracing arms clasps every\r\nland, while on its heaving bosom it bears the products of various\r\nclimes, so Peace surrounds, protects, and upholds all other blessings.\r\nWithout it, commerce is vain, the ardor of industry is restrained,\r\njustice is arrested, happiness is blasted, virtue sickens and dies.\r\n\r\nPeace, too, has its own peculiar victories, in comparison with which\r\nMarathon and Bannockburn and Bunker Hill, fields sacred in the history\r\nof human freedom, lose their lustre. Our own Washington rises to a\r\ntruly heavenly stature, not when we follow him through the ice of the\r\nDelaware to the capture of Trenton, not when we behold him victorious\r\nover Cornwallis at Yorktown, but when we regard him, in noble deference\r\nto Justice, refusing the kingly crown which a faithless soldiery\r\nproffered, and at a later day upholding the peaceful neutrality of the\r\ncountry, while he met unmoved the clamor of the people wickedly crying\r\nfor War. What glory of battle in England's annals will not fade by the\r\nside of that great act of justice, when her Parliament, at a cost of\r\none hundred million dollars, gave freedom to eight hundred thousand\r\nslaves? And when the day shall come (may these eyes be gladdened by\r\nits beams!) that shall witness an act of larger justice still,--the\r\npeaceful emancipation of three million fellow-men \"guilty of a skin\r\nnot colored as our own,\" now, in this land of jubilant freedom, bound\r\nin gloomy bondage,--then will there be a victory by the side of which\r\nthat of Bunker Hill will be as the farthing candle held up to the\r\nsun. That victory will need no monument of stone. It will be written\r\non the grateful hearts of countless multitudes that shall proclaim it\r\nto the latest generation. It will be one of the famed landmarks of\r\ncivilization,--or, better still, a link in the golden chain by which\r\nHumanity connects itself with the throne of God.\r\n\r\nAs man is higher than the beasts of the field, as the angels are higher\r\nthan man, as Christ is higher than Mars, as he that ruleth his spirit\r\nis higher than he that taketh a city,--so are the victories of Peace\r\nhigher than the victories of War.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFar be from us, fellow-citizens, on this festival, the pride of\r\nnational victory, and the illusion of national freedom, in which we\r\nare too prone to indulge! None of you make rude boast of individual\r\nprosperity or prowess. And here I end as I began. Our country cannot do\r\nwhat an individual cannot do. Therefore it must not vaunt or be puffed\r\nup. Rather bend to unperformed duties. Independence is not all. We have\r\nbut half done, when we have made ourselves free. The scornful taunt\r\nwrung from bitter experience of the great Revolution in France must\r\nnot be levelled at us: \"They wish to be _free_, but know not how to be\r\n_just_.\"[115] Nor is priceless Freedom an end in itself, but rather the\r\nmeans of Justice and Beneficence, where alone is enduring concord, with\r\nthat attendant happiness which is the final end and aim of Nations, as\r\nof every human heart. It is not enough to be free. There must be Peace\r\nwhich cannot fail, and other nations must share the great possession.\r\nFor this good must we labor, bearing ever in mind two special objects,\r\ncomplements of each other: first, the Arbitrament of War must end; and,\r\nsecondly, Disarmament must begin. With this ending and this beginning\r\nthe great gates of the Future will be opened, and the guardian virtues\r\nwill assert a new empire. Alas! until this is done, National Honor and\r\nNational Glory will yet longer flaunt in blood, and there can be no\r\nTrue Grandeur of Nations.\r\n\r\n    [115] \"_Ils veulent être libres, et ne savent pas être justes_,\" was\r\nthe famous exclamation of Sieyès.\r\n\r\nTo this great work let me summon you. That Future, which filled the\r\nlofty vision of sages and bards in Greece and Rome, which was foretold\r\nby Prophets and heralded by Evangelists, when man, in Happy Isles,\r\nor in a new Paradise, shall confess the loveliness of Peace, may you\r\nsecure, if not for yourselves, at least for your children! _Believe_\r\nthat you can do it, and you _can_ do it. The true Golden Age is before,\r\nnot behind. If man has once been driven from Paradise, while an angel\r\nwith flaming sword forbade his return, there is another Paradise,\r\neven on earth, which he may make for himself, by the cultivation\r\nof knowledge, religion, and the kindly virtues of life,--where the\r\nconfusion of tongues shall be dissolved in the union of hearts, and\r\njoyous Nature, borrowing prolific charms from prevailing Harmony, shall\r\nspread her lap with unimagined bounty, and there shall be perpetual\r\njocund Spring, and sweet strains borne on \"the odoriferous wing of\r\ngentle gales,\" through valleys of delight more pleasant than the Vale\r\nof Tempe, richer than the Garden of the Hesperides, with no dragon to\r\nguard its golden fruit.\r\n\r\nIs it said that the age does not demand this work? The robber conqueror\r\nof the Past, from fiery sepulchre, demands it; the precious blood of\r\nmillions unjustly shed in War, crying from the ground, demands it;\r\nthe heart of the good man demands it; the conscience, even of the\r\nsoldier, whispers, \"Peace!\" There are considerations springing from\r\nour situation and condition which fervently invite us to take the\r\nlead. Here should join the patriotic ardor of the land, the ambition\r\nof the statesman, the effort of the scholar, the pervasive influence\r\nof the press, the mild persuasion of the sanctuary, the early teaching\r\nof the school. Here, in ampler ether and diviner air, are untried\r\nfields for exalted triumph, more truly worthy the American name than\r\nany snatched from rivers of blood. War is known as the _Last Reason\r\nof Kings_. Let it be no reason of our Republic. Let us renounce and\r\nthrow off forever the yoke of a tyranny most oppressive of all in the\r\nworld's annals. As those standing on the mountain-top first discern the\r\ncoming beams of morning, so may we, from the vantage-ground of liberal\r\ninstitutions, first recognize the ascending sun of a new era! Lift high\r\nthe gates, and let the King of Glory in,--the King of True Glory,--of\r\nPeace! I catch the last words of music from the lips of innocence and\r\nbeauty,[116]--\r\n\r\n    \"And let the whole earth be filled with His Glory!\"\r\n\r\n    [116] The services of the choir on this occasion were performed by the\r\nyouthful daughters of the public schools of Boston.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful picture in Grecian story, that there was at least one\r\nspot, the small island of Delos, dedicated to the gods, and kept at all\r\ntimes sacred from War. No hostile foot ever pressed this kindly soil,\r\nand citizens of all countries met here, in common worship, beneath\r\nthe ægis of inviolable Peace. So let us dedicate our beloved country;\r\nand may the blessed consecration be felt in all its parts, everywhere\r\nthroughout its ample domain! The Temple of Honor shall be enclosed\r\nby the Temple of Concord, that it may never more be entered through\r\nany portal of War; the horn of Abundance shall overflow at its gates;\r\nthe angel of Religion shall be the guide over its steps of flashing\r\nadamant; while within its happy courts, purged of Violence and Wrong,\r\nJUSTICE, returned to the earth from long exile in the skies, with equal\r\nscales for nations as for men, shall rear her serene and majestic\r\nfront; and by her side, greatest of all, CHARITY, sublime in meekness,\r\nhoping all and enduring all, shall divinely temper every righteous\r\ndecree, and with words of infinite cheer inspire to those deeds that\r\ncannot vanish away. And the future chief of the Republic, destined to\r\nuphold the glories of a new era, unspotted by human blood, shall be\r\nfirst in Peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nWhile seeking these fruitful glories for ourselves, let us strive for\r\ntheir extension to other lands. Let the bugles sound the _Truce of God_\r\nto the whole world forever. Not to one people, but to every people,\r\nlet the glad tidings go. The selfish boast of the Spartan women, that\r\nthey never saw the smoke of an enemy's camp, must become the universal\r\nchorus of mankind, while the iron belt of War, now encompassing the\r\nglobe, is exchanged for the golden cestus of Peace, clothing all\r\nwith celestial beauty. History dwells with fondness on the reverent\r\nhomage bestowed by massacring soldiers upon the spot occupied by the\r\nsepulchre of the Lord. Vain man! why confine regard to a few feet of\r\nsacred mould? The whole earth is the sepulchre of the Lord; nor can\r\nany righteous man profane any part thereof. Confessing this truth, let\r\nus now, on this Sabbath of the Nation, lay a new and living stone in\r\nthe grand Temple of Universal Peace, whose dome shall be lofty as the\r\nfirmament of heaven, broad and comprehensive as earth itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TRIBUTE OF FRIENDSHIP:\r\n\r\n                        THE LATE JOSEPH STORY.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE FROM THE BOSTON DAILY ADVERTISER, SEPTEMBER 16, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just returned from the funeral of this great and good man. Under\r\nthat roof where I have so often seen him in health, buoyant with life,\r\nexuberant in kindness, happy in family and friends, I stood by his\r\nmortal remains sunk in eternal rest, and gazed upon those well-loved\r\nfeatures from which even the icy touch of death had not effaced all the\r\nliving beauty. The eye was quenched, and the glow of life extinguished;\r\nbut the noble brow seemed still to shelter, as under a marble dome, the\r\nspirit that had fled. And is he dead, I asked myself,--whose face was\r\nnever turned to me, except in affection,--who has filled the civilized\r\nworld with his name, and drawn to his country the homage of foreign\r\nnations,--who was of activity and labor that knew no rest,--who was\r\nconnected with so many circles by duties of such various kinds, by\r\nofficial ties, by sympathy, by friendship and love,--who, according\r\nto the beautiful expression of Wilberforce, \"touched life at so many\r\npoints,\"--has he, indeed, passed away? Upon the small plate on the\r\ncoffin was inscribed, JOSEPH STORY, _died September 10th, 1845, aged 66\r\nyears_. These few words might apply to the lowly citizen, as to the\r\nillustrious Judge. Thus is the coffin-plate a register of the equality\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nAt his well-known house we joined in religious worship. The Rev. Dr.\r\nWalker, present head of the University, in earnest prayer, commended\r\nhis soul to God who gave it, and invoked upon family and friends a\r\nconsecration of their afflictive bereavement. From this service we\r\nfollowed, in mournful procession, to the resting-place which he had\r\nselected for himself and his family, amidst the beautiful groves of\r\nMount Auburn. As the procession filed into the cemetery I was moved\r\nby the sight of the numerous pupils of the Law School, with uncovered\r\nheads and countenances of sorrow, ranged on each side of the road\r\nwithin the gate, testifying by silent and unexpected homage their last\r\nreverence to their departed teacher. Around the grave, as he was laid\r\nin the embrace of the mother earth, were gathered all in our community\r\nmost distinguished in law, learning, literature, station,--Judges of\r\nour Courts, Professors of the University, surviving classmates, and\r\na thick cluster of friends. He was placed among the children taken\r\nfrom him in early life. _Of such is the kingdom of heaven_ were the\r\nwords he had inscribed over their names on the simple marble which now\r\ncommemorates alike the children and their father. Nor is there a child\r\nin heaven of more childlike innocence and purity than he, who, full of\r\nyears and honors, has gone to mingle with these children.\r\n\r\nThere is another sentence, inscribed by him on this family stone,\r\nwhich speaks to us now with a voice of consolation. _Sorrow not as\r\nthose without hope_ were the words which brought solace to him in his\r\nbereavements. From his bed beneath he seems to whisper thus among\r\nhis mourning family and friends,--most especially to her, the chosen\r\npartner of his life, from whom so much of human comfort is apparently\r\nremoved. He is indeed gone; but we shall see him once more forever.\r\nWith this blessed trust, we may find happiness in dwelling upon his\r\nvirtues and fame on earth, till the great consoler, Time, shall come\r\nwith healing in his wings.\r\n\r\nFrom the grave of the Judge I walked a few short steps to that of his\r\nclassmate and friend, the beloved Channing, who died less than three\r\nyears ago, aged sixty-two. Thus these companions in early studies--each\r\nafterwards foremost in important duties, pursuing divergent paths,\r\nyet always drawn towards each other by the attractions of mutual\r\nfriendship--again meet and lie down together in the same sweet earth,\r\nin the shadow of kindred trees, through which the same birds sing a\r\nperpetual requiem.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was of unusual brilliancy, and the full-orbed sun gilded\r\nwith mellow light the funereal stones through which I wound my way,\r\nas I sought the grave of another friend, the first colleague of the\r\ndeparted Judge in the duties of the Law School,--Professor Ashmun.\r\nAfter a life crowded with usefulness, he laid down the burden of\r\ndisease which he had long borne, at the early age of thirty-three.\r\nI remember listening, in 1833, to the flowing discourse which Story\r\npronounced, in the College Chapel, over the departed; nor can I forget\r\nhis deep emotion, as we stood together at the foot of the grave, while\r\nthe earth fell, dust to dust, upon the coffin of his friend.\r\n\r\nWandering through this silent city of the dead, I called to mind those\r\nwords of Beaumont on the Tombs in Westminster Abbey:--\r\n\r\n    \"Here's an acre sown indeed\r\n     With the richest, royal'st seed\r\n     That the earth did e'er suck in\r\n     Since the first man died for sin;\r\n     Here are sands, ignoble things\r\n     Dropt from the ruined sides of kings.\"\r\n\r\nA richer royalty is sown at Mount Auburn. The kings that slumber there\r\nwere anointed by more than earthly hand.\r\n\r\nTurning again to the newest grave, I found no one but the humble\r\ngardeners, smoothing the sod over the fresh earth. It was late in the\r\nafternoon, and the upper branches of the stately trees that wave over\r\nthe sacred spot, after glistening for a while in the golden rays of the\r\nsetting sun, were left in the gloom which had already settled on the\r\ngrass beneath. Hurrying away, I reached the gate as the porter's curfew\r\nwas tolling to forgetful musers like myself the warning to leave.\r\n\r\nMoving away from the consecrated field, I thought of the pilgrims\r\nthat would come from afar, through successions of generations, to\r\nlook upon the last home of the great Jurist. From all parts of our\r\nown country, from all the lands where law is taught as a science, and\r\nwhere justice prevails, they will come to seek the grave of their\r\nmaster. Let us guard, then, this precious dust. Let us be happy, that,\r\nthough his works and his example belong to the world, his remains are\r\nplaced in our peculiar care. To us, also, who saw him face to face,\r\nin the performance of his various duties, and who sustain a loss so\r\nirreparable, is the melancholy pleasure of dwelling with household\r\naffection upon his surpassing excellences.\r\n\r\nHis death makes a chasm which I shrink from contemplating. He was the\r\nsenior Judge of the highest Court of the country, an active Professor\r\nof Law, and a Fellow in the Corporation of Harvard University. He was\r\nin himself a whole triumvirate; and these three distinguished posts,\r\nnow vacant, will be filled, in all probability, each by a distinct\r\nsuccessor. It is, however, as the Jurist that he is to take his place\r\nin the history of the world, high in the same firmament where beam\r\nthe mild glories of Tribonian, Cujas, Hale, and Mansfield. It was his\r\nfortune, unlike that of many cultivating the law with signal success\r\non the European continent, to be called as a judge practically to\r\nadminister and apply it in the business of life. It thus became to\r\nhim not merely a science, whose depths and intricacies he explored\r\nin his closet, but a great and godlike instrument, to be employed in\r\nthat grandest of earthly functions, the determination of justice among\r\nmen. While the duties of the magistrate were thus illumined by the\r\nstudies of the jurist, the latter were tempered to a finer edge by the\r\nexperience of the bench.\r\n\r\nIn the attempt to estimate his character as a Jurist, he may be\r\nregarded in _three_ different aspects,--as Judge, Author, and Teacher\r\nof Jurisprudence, exercising in each a peculiar influence. His lot is\r\nrare who achieves fame in any single department of human action; rarer\r\nstill is his who becomes foremost in many. The first impression is of\r\nastonishment, that a single mind, in a single life, should accomplish\r\nso much. Omitting the incalculable labors, of which there is no trace,\r\nexcept in the knowledge, happiness, and justice they helped to secure,\r\nthe bare amount of his written and printed works is enormous beyond\r\nprecedent in the annals of the Common Law. His written judgments on his\r\ncircuit, and his various commentaries, occupy _twenty-seven_ volumes,\r\nwhile his judgments in the Supreme Court of the United States form an\r\nimportant part of no less than _thirty-four_ volumes more. The vast\r\nprofessional labors of Coke and Eldon, which seem to clothe the walls\r\nof our libraries, must yield to his in extent. He is the Lope de Vega,\r\nor the Walter Scott, of the Common Law.\r\n\r\nWe are struck next by the universality of his juridical attainments.\r\nIt was said by Dryden of a great lawyer in English history,--Heneage\r\nFinch,--\r\n\r\n    \"Our laws, that did a boundless ocean seem,\r\n     Were coasted all and fathomed all by him.\"\r\n\r\nBut the boundless ocean of that age was a \"closed sea,\" compared with\r\nthat on which the adventurer embarks to-day. In Howell's Familiar\r\nLetters there is a saying of only a few short years before, that\r\nthe books of the Common Law might all be carried in a wheelbarrow.\r\nTo coast such an ocean were a less task than a moiety of his labors\r\nwhom we now mourn. Called to administer all the different branches of\r\nlaw, kept separate in England, he showed a mastery of all. His was\r\nUniversal Empire; and wherever he set his foot, in the various realms\r\nof jurisprudence, it was as a sovereign,--whether in the ancient\r\nand subtile learning of Real Law,--the Criminal Law,--the niceties\r\nof Special Pleading,--the more refined doctrines of Contracts,--the\r\nmore rational system of Commercial and Maritime Law,--the peculiar\r\nand interesting principles and practice of Admiralty and Prize,--the\r\nimmense range of Chancery,--the modern, but important, jurisdiction\r\nover Patents,--or that higher region, the great themes of Public and\r\nConstitutional Law. In each of these branches there are judgments\r\nby him which will not yield in value to those of any other judge in\r\nEngland or the United States, even though his studies and duties may\r\nhave been directed to only one particular department.\r\n\r\nHis judgments are remarkable for exhaustive treatment. The Common\r\nLaw, as every student knows to his cost, is found only in innumerable\r\n\"sand-grains\" of authority. In his learned expositions not one of these\r\nis overlooked, while all are combined with care, and the golden cord of\r\nreason is woven across the ample tissue. There is in them, besides, a\r\nclearness which flings over the subject a perfect day,--a severe logic,\r\nwhich, by its closeness and precision, makes us feel the truth of the\r\nsaying of Leibnitz, that nothing approaches so near the certainty of\r\ngeometry as the reasoning of the law,--a careful attention to the\r\ndiscussions at the bar, that nothing should be lost,--with a copious\r\nand persuasive eloquence investing the whole. Many of his judgments\r\nwill be landmarks in the law: I know of no single judge who has set up\r\nso many. I think it may be said, without fear of question, that the\r\nReports show a larger number of judicial opinions from Story, which\r\nposterity will not willingly let die, than from any other judge in the\r\nhistory of English or American law.\r\n\r\nThere is much of his character as a Judge which cannot be preserved,\r\nexcept in the faithful memory of those whose happiness it was to enjoy\r\nhis judicial presence. I refer particularly to his mode of conducting\r\nbusiness. Even the passing stranger bore witness to his suavity of\r\nmanner on the bench, while all practitioners in the courts where\r\nhe presided so long attest the marvellous quickness with which he\r\nseized habitually the points of a case, often anticipating the slower\r\nmovements of counsel, and leaping, or, I might almost say, flying, to\r\nthe proper conclusion. Napoleon's perception, at the head of an army,\r\nwas not more rapid. Nor can I forget the scrupulous care with which he\r\nassigned reasons for every portion of his opinions, showing that it was\r\nnot _he_ who spoke with the voice of authority, but the _law_, whose\r\norgan he was.\r\n\r\nIn the history of the English bench there are but two names with\r\ncombined eminence as Judge and Author,--Coke and Hale,--unless, indeed,\r\nthe \"Ordinances in Chancery,\" from the Verulamian pen, should entitle\r\nLord Bacon to this distinction, and the judgments of Lord Brougham\r\nshould vindicate the same for him. Blackstone's character as judge is\r\nlost in the fame of the Commentaries. To Story belongs this double\r\nglory. Early in life he compiled an important professional work; but\r\nit was only at a comparatively recent period, after his mind had\r\nbeen disciplined by the labors of the bench, that he prepared those\r\nelaborate Commentaries which have made his name a familiar word in\r\nforeign countries. They who knew him best observed the lively interest\r\nwhich he took in this extension of his renown. And most justly; for\r\nthe voice of distant foreign nations comes as from a living posterity.\r\nHis works have been reviewed with praise in the journals of England,\r\nScotland, Ireland, France, and Germany. They are cited as authorities\r\nin all the Courts of Westminster Hall; and one of the ablest and most\r\nlearned jurists of the age, whose honorable career at the bar has\r\nopened to him the peerage,--Lord Campbell,--in the course of debate in\r\nthe House of Lords, accorded to their author an exalted place, saying\r\nthat he \"had a greater reputation as a legal writer than any author\r\nEngland could boast since the days of Blackstone.\"[117]\r\n\r\n    [117] Hansard, LXVIII. 667.\r\n\r\nTo complete this hasty survey, I should allude to his excellences\r\nas a Teacher of law, that other relation which he sustained to\r\njurisprudence. The numerous pupils reared at his feet, and now\r\nscattered throughout the country, diffusing, in their different\r\ncircles, the light obtained at Cambridge, as they hear that their\r\nbeloved master has fallen, will each feel that he has lost a friend.\r\nHe had the faculty, rare as it is exquisite, of interesting the\r\nyoung, and winning their affections. I have often seen him surrounded\r\nby a group of youths,--the ancient Romans might have aptly called\r\nit a _corona_,--all intent upon his earnest conversation, and\r\nfreely interrogating him on matters of interest. In his lectures,\r\nand other forms of instruction, he was prodigal of explanation and\r\nillustration; his manner, according to the classical image of Zeno,\r\nwas like the open palm, never like the clenched fist. His learning\r\nwas always overflowing, as from the horn of abundance. He was earnest\r\nand unrelaxing in effort, patient and gentle, while he listened with\r\ninspiring attention to all that the pupil said. Like Chaucer's Clerk,\r\n\r\n      \"And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.\"\r\n\r\nAbove all, he was a living example of love for the law,--supposed by\r\nmany to be unlovely and repulsive,--which seemed to grow warmer under\r\nthe snows of accumulating winters; and such an example could not fail,\r\nwith magnetic power, to touch the hearts of the young. Nor should I\r\nforget the lofty standard of professional morals which he inculcated,\r\nfilling his discourse with the charm of goodness. Under such auspices,\r\nand those of his learned associate, Professor Greenleaf, large classes\r\nof students, larger than any other in America, or in England, were\r\nannually gathered in Cambridge. The Law School became the glory of the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nHe was proud of his character as Professor. In his earlier works he is\r\ncalled on the title-page \"Dane Professor of Law.\" It was only on the\r\nsuggestion of the English publisher that he was induced to append the\r\nother title, \"One of the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.\" He looked forward with peculiar satisfaction to the time which\r\nseemed at hand, when he should lay down the honors and cares of the\r\nbench, and devote himself singly to the duties of his chair.\r\n\r\nI have merely glanced at him in his three several relations to\r\njurisprudence. Great in each, it is on this unprecedented combination\r\nthat his peculiar fame will be reared, as upon an immortal tripod. In\r\nwhat I have written, I do not think I am biased by partialities of\r\nprivate friendship. I have endeavored to regard him as posterity will\r\nregard him, as all must regard him now who fully know him in his works.\r\nImagine for one moment the irreparable loss, if all that he has done\r\nwere blotted out forever. As I think of the incalculable facilities\r\nafforded by his labors, I cannot but say with Racine, when speaking of\r\nDescartes, \"_Nous courons; mais, sans lui, nous ne marcherions pas._\"\r\nBesides, it is he who has inspired in many foreign bosoms, reluctant\r\nto perceive good in our country, a sincere homage to the American\r\nname. He has turned the stream refluent upon the ancient fountains\r\nof Westminster Hall, and, stranger still, has forced the waters\r\nabove their sources, up the unaccustomed heights of countries alien\r\nto the Common Law. It is he also who has directed, from the copious\r\nwell-springs of Roman Law, and from the fresher currents of modern\r\nContinental Law, a pure and grateful stream to enrich and fertilize our\r\ndomestic jurisprudence. In his judgments, his books, and his teachings,\r\nhe drew always from other systems to illustrate the Common Law.\r\n\r\nThe mind naturally seeks to compare him with eminent jurists, servants\r\nof Themis, who share with him the wide spaces of fame. In genius for\r\nthe law, in the exceeding usefulness of his career, in the blended\r\ncharacter of Judge and Author, he cannot yield to our time-honored\r\nmaster, Lord Coke; in suavity of manner, and in silver-tongued\r\neloquence, he may compare with Lord Mansfield, while in depth,\r\naccuracy, and variety of juridical learning he surpassed him far; if\r\nhe yields to Lord Stowell in elegance of diction, he exceeds even\r\nhis excellence in curious exploration of the foundations of that\r\njurisdiction which they administered in common, and in the development\r\nof those great principles of public law whose just determination helps\r\nto preserve the peace of nations; and even in the peculiar field\r\nillustrated by the long career of Eldon, we find him a familiar worker,\r\nwith Eldon's profusion of learning, and without the perplexity of his\r\ndoubts. There are many who regard the judicial character of the late\r\nChief Justice Marshall as unapproachable. I revere his name, and have\r\nread his judgments, which seem like \"pure reason,\" with admiration and\r\ngratitude; but I cannot disguise that even these noble memorials must\r\nyield in juridical character, learning, acuteness, fervor, variety of\r\ntopics, as they are far inferior in amount, to those of our friend.\r\nThere is still spared to us a renowned judge, at this moment the\r\nunquestioned living head of American jurisprudence, with no rival\r\nnear the throne,--Chancellor Kent,--whose judgments and works always\r\ninspired the warmest eulogy of the departed, and whose character as a\r\njurist furnishes the fittest parallel to his own in the annals of our\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIt seems idle to weave further these vain comparisons, particularly\r\nto invoke the living. But busy fancy revives the past, and persons\r\nand scenes renew themselves in my memory. I call to mind the recent\r\nChancellor of England, the model of a clear, grave, learned, and\r\nconscientious magistrate,--Lord Cottenham. I see again the ornaments of\r\nWestminster Hall, on the bench and at the bar, where sits Denman, in\r\nmanner, conduct, and character \"every inch\" the judge,--where pleaded\r\nthe consummate lawyer, Follett, whose voice is now hushed in the grave;\r\ntheir judgments, their arguments, their conversation I cannot forget;\r\nbut thinking of these, I feel new pride in the great Magistrate, the\r\njust Judge, the consummate Lawyer whom we lament.\r\n\r\nIt has been my fortune to know the chief jurists of our time, in the\r\nclassical countries of jurisprudence, France and Germany. I remember\r\nwell the pointed and effective style of Dupin, in one of his masterly\r\narguments before the highest court of France; I recall the pleasant\r\nconverse of Pardessus--to whom commercial and maritime law is under a\r\nlarger debt, perhaps, than to any other mind--while he descanted on\r\nhis favorite theme; I wander in fancy to the gentle presence of him\r\nwith flowing silver locks who was so dear to Germany,--Thibaut, the\r\nexpounder of Roman law, and the earnest and successful advocate of a\r\njust scheme for the reduction of the unwritten law to the certainty\r\nof a written text; from Heidelberg I pass to Berlin, where I listen\r\nto the grave lecture and mingle in the social circle of Savigny, so\r\nstately in person and peculiar in countenance, whom all the continent\r\nof Europe delights to honor; but my heart and my judgment, untravelled,\r\nfondly turn with new love and admiration to my Cambridge teacher and\r\nfriend. Jurisprudence has many arrows in her quiver, but where is one\r\nto compare with that which is now spent in the earth?\r\n\r\nThe fame of the Jurist is enhanced by various attainments superinduced\r\nupon learning in the law. His \"Miscellaneous Writings\" show a\r\nthoughtful mind, imbued with elegant literature, warm with kindly\r\nsentiments, commanding a style of rich and varied eloquence. Many\r\npassages from these have become commonplaces of our schools. In early\r\nlife he yielded to the fascinations of the poetic muse; and here the\r\ngreat lawyer may find companionship with Selden, who is introduced by\r\nSuckling into the \"Session of the Poets\" as \"hard by the chair,\"--with\r\nBlackstone, whose \"Farewell to his Muse\" shows his fondness for poetic\r\npastures, even while his eye was directed to the heights of the\r\nlaw,--and also with Mansfield, whom Pope has lamented in familiar words,\r\n\r\n    \"How sweet an Ovid Murray! was our boast.\"\r\n\r\nI have now before me, in his own handwriting, some verses written by\r\nhim in 1833, entitled, \"Advice to a Young Lawyer.\" As they cannot fail\r\nto be read with interest, I introduce them here.\r\n\r\n      \"Whene'er you speak, remember every cause\r\n    Stands not on eloquence, but stands on laws;\r\n    Pregnant in matter, in expression brief,\r\n    Let every sentence stand with bold relief;\r\n    On trifling points nor time nor talents waste,\r\n    A sad offence to learning and to taste;\r\n    Nor deal with pompous phrase, nor e'er suppose\r\n    Poetic flights belong to reasoning prose.\r\n    Loose declamation may deceive the crowd,\r\n    And seem more striking as it grows more loud;\r\n    But sober sense rejects it with disdain,\r\n    As naught but empty noise, and weak as vain.\r\n    The froth of words, the schoolboy's vain parade\r\n    Of books and cases (all his stock in trade).\r\n    The pert conceits, the cunning tricks and play\r\n    Of low attorneys, strung in long array,\r\n    The unseemly jest, the petulant reply,\r\n    That chatters on, and cares not how nor why,\r\n    Studious, avoid: unworthy themes to scan,\r\n    They sink the speaker and disgrace the man;\r\n    Like the false lights by flying shadows cast,\r\n    Scarce seen when present, and forgot when past.\r\n\r\n      \"Begin with dignity; expound with grace\r\n    Each ground of reasoning in its time and place;\r\n    Let order reign throughout; each topic touch,\r\n    Nor urge its power too little or too much;\r\n    Give each strong thought its most attractive view,\r\n    In diction clear, and yet severely true;\r\n    And as the arguments in splendor grow,\r\n    Let each reflect its light on all below.\r\n    When to the close arrived, make no delays\r\n    By petty flourishes or verbal plays,\r\n    But sum the whole in one deep, solemn strain,\r\n    Like a strong current hastening to the main.\"\r\n\r\nBut the jurist, rich with the spoils of time, the exalted magistrate,\r\nthe orator, the writer, all vanish when I think of the friend. Much\r\nas the world may admire his memory, all who knew him will love it\r\nmore. Who can forget his bounding step, his contagious laugh, his\r\nexhilarating voice, his beaming smile, his countenance that shone like\r\na benediction? What pen can describe these? What canvas or marble can\r\nportray them? He was always the friend of the young, who never tired\r\nin listening to his mellifluous discourse. Nor did they ever leave\r\nhis presence without a warmer glow of virtue, a more inspiring love\r\nof knowledge, and more generous impulses of action. I remember him\r\nin my childhood; but I first knew him after he came to Cambridge as\r\nProfessor, while I was yet an undergraduate, and now recall freshly, as\r\nif the words were of yesterday, the eloquence and animation with which\r\nat that time he enforced upon a youthful circle the beautiful truth,\r\n_that no man stands in the way of another_. The world is wide enough\r\nfor all, he said, and no success which may crown our neighbor can\r\naffect our own career. In this spirit he ran his race on earth, without\r\njealousy, without envy,--nay, more, overflowing with appreciation and\r\npraise of labors which compared humbly with his own. In conversation\r\nhe dwelt with fervor upon all the topics which interest man,--not only\r\nupon law, but upon literature, history, human character, the affairs\r\nof every day,--above all, upon the great duties of life, the relations\r\nof men to each other, to country, to God. High in his mind, above all\r\nhuman opinions and practices, were the everlasting rules of _Right_;\r\nnor did he ever rise to truer eloquence than when condemning, as I have\r\nmore than once heard him recently, that evil sentiment, \"Our country,\r\n_right or wrong_\" which, in whatsoever form of language it may disguise\r\nitself, assails the very foundations of justice and virtue.\r\n\r\nHe was happy in life, happy also in death. It was his hope, expressed\r\nin health, that he should not be allowed to linger superfluous on the\r\nstage, nor waste under the slow progress of disease. He was always\r\nready to meet his God. His wishes were answered. Two days before his\r\nlast illness he was in court, and delivered an elaborate judgment on a\r\ncomplicated case in equity. Since his death another judgment in a case\r\nalready argued before him has been found among his papers, ready to be\r\npronounced.\r\n\r\nI saw him for a single moment on the evening preceding his illness.\r\nIt was an accidental meeting away from his own house,--the last time\r\nthat the open air fanned his cheeks. His words of familiar, household\r\ngreeting still linger in my ears, like an enchanted melody. The morning\r\nsun saw him on the bed from which he never rose.\r\n\r\nThus closed, after an illness of eight days, in the bosom of his\r\nfamily, without pain, surrounded by friends, a life which, through\r\nvarious vicissitudes of disease, had been spared beyond the grand\r\nclimacteric, that Cape of Storms in the sea of human existence.\r\n\r\n    \"Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit,\r\n     Nulli flebilior quam mihi.\"\r\n\r\nHe is gone, and we shall see him no more on earth, except in his works,\r\nand the memory of his virtues. The scales of justice, which he so long\r\nheld, have fallen from his hand. The untiring pen of the Author rests\r\nat last. The voice of the Teacher is mute. The fountain, which was\r\never flowing and ever full, is stopped. The lips, on which the bees of\r\nHybla might have rested, will no more distil their honeyed sweets. The\r\nmanly form, warm with all the affections of life, with love for family\r\nand friends, for truth and virtue, is now cold in death. The justice\r\nof nations is eclipsed; the life of the law is suspended. But let us\r\nlisten to the words which, though dead, he utters from the grave:\r\n\"Sorrow not as those without hope.\" The righteous judge, the wise\r\nteacher, the faithful friend, the loving father, has ascended to his\r\nJudge, his Teacher, his Friend, his Father in Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE WRONG OF SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n    SPEECH AT A PUBLIC MEETING IN FANEUIL HALL, BOSTON, AGAINST THE\r\n        ADMISSION OF TEXAS AS A SLAVE STATE, NOVEMBER 4, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The officers of this meeting were Hon. Charles Francis Adams,\r\n    President; James M. Whiton, Charles G. Hovey, and William I.\r\n    Bowditch, Secretaries. The President made a speech on taking the\r\n    chair. He was followed by Hon. John G. Palfrey, Charles Sumner,\r\n    Wendell Phillips, Henry B. Stanton, George S. Hillard, Rev. William\r\n    H. Channing, and William Lloyd Garrison. The meeting was thus\r\n    sympathetically described by the _Liberator_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Faneuil Hall next had a meeting, more worthy of its fame than\r\n    the one which was held in it on Tuesday evening last, to set the\r\n    ball in motion for another grand rally of the freemen of the North\r\n    against the admission of Texas into the Union as a Slave State.\r\n    The weather was extremely unpropitious,--the rain pouring down\r\n    violently, the thunder roaring, and the lightning blazing vividly\r\n    at intervals,--emblematic of the present moral and political\r\n    aspects of the country.\"\r\n\r\n    The _Daily Times_, a democratic paper of Boston, in its account of\r\n    the meeting made the severe storm play an important part. Here is\r\n    something of what it said:--\r\n\r\n    \"The elements seemed determined not to sanction any such\r\n    traitor-like movement, and interposed every obstacle to its\r\n    success. It was proper that such a foul project should have foul\r\n    weather as an accompaniment. The night was dark, and so were the\r\n    designs contemplated.\" To oppose the extension of slavery was\r\n    traitor-like, foul, and dark.\r\n\r\n    The Resolutions adopted at the meeting were drawn by Mr. Sumner,\r\n    although introduced by another. They were the first political\r\n    resolutions ever drawn by him, as the speech which follows was\r\n    the first political speech ever made by him. The Resolutions,\r\n    while condemning slavery and denouncing the plan to secure\r\n    its predominance in the National Government, start with the\r\n    annunciation of _Equal Rights and the_ _Brotherhood of all\r\n    Men_, as set forth in the Declaration of Independence, which Mr.\r\n    Sumner always, from beginning to end, made the foundation of his\r\n    arguments, appeals, and aspirations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"_Whereas_ the Government and Independence of the United States\r\n    are founded on the adamantine truth of _Equal Rights and the\r\n    Brotherhood of all Men_, declared on the 4th of July, 1776, a truth\r\n    receiving new and constant recognition in the progress of time, and\r\n    which is the great lesson from our country to the world, in support\r\n    of which the founders toiled and bled, and on account of which we,\r\n    their children, bless their memory,--\r\n\r\n    \"_And whereas_ it is essential to our self-respect as a nation, and\r\n    to our fame in history, that this truth, declared by our fathers,\r\n    should not be impeached or violated by any fresh act of their\r\n    children,--\r\n\r\n    \"_And whereas_ the scheme for the annexation of Texas as a Slave\r\n    State, begun in stealth and fraud, and carried on to confirm\r\n    Slavery and extend its bounds, in violation of the fundamental\r\n    principle of our institutions, is not consummated, and may yet\r\n    be arrested by the zealous and hearty co-operation of all who\r\n    sincerely love their country and the liberty of mankind,--\r\n\r\n    \"_And whereas_ this scheme, if successful, involves the whole\r\n    country, Free States as well as slave-owners, in one of the two\r\n    greatest crimes a nation can commit, and threatens to involve them\r\n    in the other,--namely, Slavery and unjust War,--Slavery of the most\r\n    revolting character, and War to sustain Slavery,--\r\n\r\n    \"_And whereas_ the State Constitution of Texas, which will soon\r\n    be submitted to Congress for adoption or rejection, expressly\r\n    prohibits the Legislature, except under conditions rendering\r\n    the exception practically void, from enacting any law for the\r\n    emancipation of slaves, and for the abolition of the slave-trade\r\n    between Texas and the United States, thereby reversing entirely the\r\n    natural and just tendency of our institutions towards Freedom,--\r\n\r\n    \"_And whereas_ the slaveholders seek annexation for the purpose\r\n    of increasing the market of human flesh, and for extending and\r\n    perpetuating Slavery,--\r\n\r\n    \"_And whereas_, by the triumph of this scheme, and by creating new\r\n    Slave States within the limits of Texas, the slaveholders seek to\r\n    control the political power of the majority of freemen represented\r\n    in the Congress of the Union:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Therefore be it resolved_, in the name of God, of Christ, and\r\n    of Humanity, that we, belonging to all political parties, and\r\n    reserving all other reasons of objection, unite in protest against\r\n    the admission of Texas into this Union as a Slave State.\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That the people of Massachusetts will continue to\r\n    resist the consummation of this wicked purpose, which will cover\r\n    the country with disgrace, and make us responsible for crimes of\r\n    gigantic magnitude.\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That we have the fullest confidence that the Senators\r\n    and Representatives of Massachusetts in Congress will never consent\r\n    to the admission of Texas as a Slave State, but by voice and vote\r\n    will resist this fatal measure to the utmost at every stage.\r\n\r\n    \"_And furthermore, whereas_ the Congress of the United States, by\r\n    assuming to connect this country with a foreign state, have already\r\n    involved the people of the Free States in great expenditure for the\r\n    protection of the usurped territory by force of arms on sea and\r\n    land,--\r\n\r\n    \"_And whereas_ a still greater outlay may hereafter be incurred to\r\n    maintain by violence what is held by wrong:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That we protest against the policy of enlisting the\r\n    strength of a free people to sustain by physical force a measure\r\n    urged with the criminal purpose of perpetuating a system of slavery\r\n    at war with the fundamental principle of our institutions.\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That a committee be appointed by the chair to present\r\n    copies of these Resolutions to the Senators and Representatives\r\n    from Massachusetts, and also to send them to every Senator and\r\n    Representative in Congress from the Free States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman,--I could not listen to the appropriate remarks of my\r\nfriend, the Secretary of the Commonwealth,[118] without recalling an\r\nimportant act in his life, and feeling anew what all must feel, the\r\nbeauty of his example in the fraternal treatment of slaves descended\r\nto him by inheritance, manumitting them as he has done, and conducting\r\nthem far away from Slavery into these more cheerful precincts of\r\nFreedom. In offering him this humble tribute, I am sure that I awaken\r\na response in every heart that has not ceased to throb at the recital\r\nof an act of self-sacrifice and humanity. He has done as a citizen what\r\nMassachusetts is now called to do as a State. He has divested himself\r\nof all responsibility for any accession of slave property, and the\r\nState must do likewise.\r\n\r\n    [118] Hon. John G. Palfrey.\r\n\r\nThere are occasions, in the progress of affairs, when persons, though\r\nordinarily opposed to each other, come together, and even the lukewarm,\r\nthe listless, the indifferent unite heartily in a common object.\r\nSuch is the case in great calamities, when the efforts of all are\r\nneeded to avert a fatal blow. If the fire-bell startles us from our\r\nslumbers, we do not ask of what faith in politics or religion is the\r\nunfortunate brother whose house is exposed to conflagration; it is\r\nenough that there is misfortune to be averted. In this spirit we have\r\nassembled on this inclement evening,--putting aside all distinctions of\r\nparty,--forgetting all disagreements of opinion, to remember one thing\r\nonly, on which all are agreed,--renouncing all discords, to stand firm\r\non one ground only, where we all meet in concord: I mean opposition to\r\nTexas as a Slave State.\r\n\r\nThe scheme for the annexation of Texas, begun in stealth and fraud,\r\nin order to extend and strengthen Slavery, has not yet received the\r\nfinal sanction of Congress. According to the course proposed by\r\nthese machinators, it is necessary that Texas should be formally\r\nadmitted into the family of States by a vote of Congress, and that\r\nher Constitution should be approved by Congress. The question will be\r\npresented this winter, and we would, if we could, strengthen the hearts\r\nand words of those by whom the measure will be opposed.\r\n\r\nOurs is no factious or irregular course. It has the sanction of the\r\nbest examples on a kindred occasion. The very question before us\r\noccurred in 1819, on the admission of Missouri as a Slave State. I need\r\nnot remind you of the ardor and constancy with which this was opposed\r\nat the North, by men of all parties, with scarcely a dissenting voice.\r\nOne universal chorus of protest thundered from the North against the\r\nformation of what was called another _black State_. Meetings were\r\nconvened in all the considerable towns,--Philadelphia, Trenton, New\r\nYork, New Haven, and everywhere throughout Massachusetts,--to make this\r\nopposition audible on the floor of Congress. At Boston, December the\r\n3d, 1819, a meeting without distinction of party, and embracing the\r\nleaders of both sides, was held in the State-House. That meeting, in\r\nits object, was precisely like the present. A numerous committee to\r\nprepare resolutions was appointed, of which William Eustis, afterwards\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts, was chairman. With him were associated John\r\nPhillips, at that time President of the Senate of Massachusetts,--a\r\nname dear to every friend of the slave, as father of him to whose\r\neloquent voice we hope to listen to-night,[119]--Timothy Bigelow,\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, William Gray, Henry Dearborn,\r\nJosiah Quincy, Daniel Webster, William Ward, William Prescott, Thomas\r\nH. Perkins, Stephen White, Benjamin Pickman, William Sullivan, George\r\nBlake, David Cummins, James Savage, John Gallison, James T. Austin, and\r\nHenry Orne. No committee could have been appointed better fitted to\r\ninspire the confidence of all sides. Numerous as were its members, they\r\nwere all men of mark and consideration in our community. This committee\r\nreported the following resolutions, which were adopted by the meeting.\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, as the opinion of this meeting, that the Congress\r\n    of the United States possesses the constitutional power, upon\r\n    the admission of any new State created beyond the limits of the\r\n    original territory of the United States, to make the prohibition of\r\n    the further extension of slavery or involuntary servitude in such\r\n    new State a condition of its admission.\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That, in the opinion of this meeting, it is just and\r\n    expedient that this power should be exercised by Congress upon the\r\n    admission of all new States created beyond the original limits of\r\n    the United States.\"\r\n\r\n    [119] Wendell Phillips Esq.\r\n\r\nThe meeting in Boston was followed by another in Salem, called,\r\naccording to the terms of the notice, to consider \"whether the immense\r\nregion of country extending from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean\r\nis destined to be the abode of happiness, independence, and freedom,\r\n_or the wide prison of misery and slavery_.\" Resolutions were passed\r\nagainst the admission of any Slave State, being supported by Benjamin\r\nT. Pickman, Andrew Dunlap, and Joseph Story, a name of authority\r\nwherever found. In the meeting at Worcester, Solomon Strong and\r\nLevi Lincoln took a prominent part. Resolutions were adopted here,\r\n\"earnestly requesting their representatives in Congress to use their\r\nunremitted exertions to prevent the sanction of that honorable body to\r\nany further introduction of slavery within the extending limits of the\r\nUnited States.\" By these assemblies the Commonwealth was aroused. To\r\nSlavery it presented an unbroken front.\r\n\r\nSince these efforts in the cause of Freedom twenty-five years have\r\npassed. Some of the partakers in them are still spared to us,--I\r\nneed not add, full of years and honors. The larger part have been\r\ncalled from the duty of opposing slavery on earth. The same question\r\nwhich aroused their energies presents itself to us. Shall we be less\r\nfaithful than they? Will Massachusetts oppose a less unbroken front\r\nnow than then? In the lapse of these few years has the love of freedom\r\ndiminished? Has sensibility to human suffering lost any of the keenness\r\nof its edge?\r\n\r\nLet us regard the question more closely. Congress is asked to\r\nsanction the Constitution of Texas, which not only supports slavery,\r\nbut contains a clause prohibiting the Legislature of the State from\r\nabolishing slavery. In doing this, it will give a fresh stamp of\r\nlegislative approbation to an unrighteous system; it will assume a\r\nnew and active responsibility for the system; it will again become\r\na dealer in human flesh, and on a gigantic scale. At this moment,\r\nwhen the conscience of mankind is at last aroused to the enormity of\r\nholding a fellow-man in bondage, when, throughout the civilized world,\r\na slave-dealer is a by-word and a reproach, we as a nation are about\r\nto become proprietors of a large population of slaves. Such an act, at\r\nthis time, is removed from the reach of that palliation often extended\r\nto slavery. Slavery, we are speciously told by those who defend it,\r\nis not our original sin. It was entailed upon us by our ancestors, so\r\nwe are instructed; and the responsibility is often, with exultation,\r\nthrown upon the mother country. Now, without stopping to inquire into\r\nthe truth of this allegation, it is sufficient for the present purpose\r\nto know that by welcoming Texas as a Slave State we make slavery our\r\nown original sin. Here is a new case of actual transgression, which we\r\ncannot cast upon the shoulders of any progenitors, nor upon any mother\r\ncountry, distant in time or place. The Congress of the United States,\r\nthe people of the United States, at this day, in this vaunted period of\r\nlight, will be responsible for it; so that it will be said hereafter,\r\nso long as the dreadful history of Slavery is read, that in the present\r\nyear of Christ a new and deliberate act was passed to confirm and\r\nextend it.\r\n\r\nBy the present movement we propose no measure of change. We do not\r\noffer to interfere with any institution of the Southern States,\r\nnor to modify any law on the subject of Slavery anywhere under\r\nthe Constitution. Our movement is conservative. It is to preserve\r\nexisting supports of Freedom; it is to prevent the violation of free\r\ninstitutions in their vital principles.\r\n\r\nSuch a movement should unite in its support all but those few in\r\nwhose distorted or unnatural vision slavery seems to be a great good.\r\nMost clearly should it unite the freemen of the North, by all the\r\nconsiderations of self-interest, and by those higher considerations\r\nfounded on the rights of man. I cannot dwell now upon the controlling\r\npolitical influence in the councils of the country which the annexation\r\nof Texas will secure to slaveholders. This topic is of importance;\r\nbut it yields to the supreme requirements of religion, morals, and\r\nhumanity. I cannot banish from my view the great shame and wrong of\r\nslavery. Judges of our courts have declared it contrary to the Law of\r\nNature, finding its support only in positive enactments of men. Its\r\nhorrors who can tell? Language utterly fails to depict them.\r\n\r\nBy the proposed measure, we not only become parties to the acquisition\r\nof a large population of slaves, with all the crime of slavery, but we\r\nopen a new market for the slaves of Virginia and the Carolinas, and\r\n_legalize a new slave-trade_. A new slave-trade! Consider this well.\r\nYou cannot forget the horrors of that too famous \"middle passage,\"\r\nwhere crowds of human beings, stolen, and borne by sea far from their\r\nwarm African homes, are pressed on shipboard into spaces of smaller\r\ndimensions for each than a coffin. And yet the deadly consequences\r\nof this middle passage are believed to fall short of those sometimes\r\nundergone by the wretched coffles driven from the exhausted lands\r\nof the Northern Slave States to the sugar plantations nearer the\r\nsun of the South. One quarter part are said often to perish in\r\nthese removals. I see them, in imagination, on their fatal journey,\r\nchained in bands, and driven like cattle, leaving behind what has\r\nbecome to them a home and a country, (alas! what a home, and what a\r\ncountry!)--husband torn from wife, and parent from child, to be sold\r\nanew into more direful captivity. Can this take place with our consent,\r\nnay, without our most determined opposition? If the slave-trade is to\r\nreceive new adoption from our country, let us have no part or lot in\r\nit. Let us wash our hands of this great guilt. As we read its horrors,\r\nmay each of us be able to exclaim, with conscience void of offence,\r\n\"Thou canst not say I did it.\" God forbid that the votes and voices of\r\nNorthern freemen should help to bind anew the fetters of the slave!\r\nGod forbid that the lash of the slave-dealer should descend by any\r\nsanction from New England! God forbid that the blood which spurts from\r\nthe lacerated, quivering flesh of the slave should soil the hem of the\r\nwhite garments of Massachusetts!\r\n\r\nVoices of discouragement reach us from other parts of the country, and\r\neven from our own friends in this bracing air. We are told that all\r\nexertion will be vain, and that the admission of a new Slave State is\r\n\"a foregone conclusion.\" But this is no reason why we should shrink\r\nfrom duty. \"I will try,\" was the response of an American officer on\r\nthe field of battle. \"England expects every man to do his duty,\" was\r\nthe signal of the British admiral. Ours is a contest holier than those\r\nwhich aroused these stirring words. Let _us_ try. Let every man among\r\n_us_ do his duty.\r\n\r\nAnd suppose New England stands alone in these efforts; suppose\r\nMassachusetts stands alone: is it not a noble isolation? Is it not\r\nthe post of honor? Is it not the position where she will find\r\ncompanionship with all that is great and generous in the past,--with\r\nall the disciples of truth, of right, of liberty? It has not been her\r\nwont on former occasions to inquire whether she should stand alone.\r\nYour honored ancestor, Mr. Chairman, who from these walls regards our\r\nproceedings to-night, did not ask whether Massachusetts would be alone,\r\nwhen she commenced that opposition which ended in the independence of\r\nthe Thirteen Colonies.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot fail to accomplish great good. It is in obedience\r\nto a prevailing law of Providence, that no act of self-sacrifice,\r\nof devotion to duty, of humanity can fail. It stands forever as a\r\nlandmark, from which at least to make a new effort. Future champions of\r\nequal rights and human brotherhood will derive new strength from these\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nLet Massachusetts, then, be aroused. Let all her children be summoned\r\nto this holy cause. There are questions of ordinary politics in which\r\nmen may remain neutral; but neutrality now is treason to liberty, to\r\nhumanity, and to the fundamental principles of free institutions. Let\r\nher united voice, with the accumulated echoes of freedom that fill\r\nthis ancient hall, go forth with comfort and cheer to all who labor in\r\nthe same cause everywhere throughout the land. Let it help to confirm\r\nthe wavering, and to reclaim those who have erred from the right\r\npath. Especially may it exert a proper influence in Congress upon the\r\nrepresentatives of the Free States. May it serve to make them as firm\r\nin the defence of Freedom as their opponents are pertinacious in the\r\ncause of Slavery.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts must continue foremost in the cause of Freedom; nor can\r\nher children yield to deadly dalliance with Slavery. They must resist\r\nat all times, and be forearmed against the fatal influence. There is a\r\nstory of the magnetic mountain which drew out the iron bolts of a ship,\r\nthough at a great distance. Slavery is such a mountain, and too often\r\ndraws out the iron bolts of representatives. There is another story of\r\nthe Norwegian maelström, which, after sucking a ship into its vortex,\r\nwhirls the victim round and round until it is dashed in pieces. Slavery\r\nis such a maelström. Representatives must continue safe and firm,\r\nnotwithstanding magnetic mountain or maelström. But this can be only by\r\nfollowing those principles for which Massachusetts is renowned.\r\n\r\nA precious incident in the life of one whom our country has delighted\r\nto honor furnishes an example for imitation. When Napoleon, already\r\nat the pinnacle of military honor, but lusting for perpetuity of\r\npower, caused a vote to be taken on the question, whether he should\r\nbe First Consul for life, Lafayette, at that time in retirement, and\r\nonly recently, by his intervention, liberated from the dungeons of\r\nOlmütz, deliberately registered his _No_. Afterwards revisiting our\r\nshores, the scene of his youthful devotion to freedom, and receiving\r\non all sides that beautiful homage of thanksgiving which is of itself\r\nan all-sufficient answer to the sarcasm that republics are ungrateful,\r\nhere in Boston, this illustrious Frenchman listened with especial pride\r\nto the felicitation addressed to him as \"the man who knew so well how\r\nto say _No_.\" Be this the example for Massachusetts; and may it be\r\namong her praises hereafter, that on this occasion she knew so well how\r\nto say NO!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   EQUAL RIGHTS IN THE LECTURE-ROOM.\r\n\r\n LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE OF THE NEW BEDFORD LYCEUM, NOVEMBER 29, 1845.\r\n\r\n    After accepting an invitation to lecture before the Lyceum at New\r\n    Bedford, Mr. Sumner, learning that colored persons were denied\r\n    membership and equal opportunities with white persons, refused to\r\n    lecture, as appears in the following Letter, which was published in\r\n    the papers of the time.\r\n\r\n    Shortly afterwards the obnoxious rule was rescinded, and Mr. Sumner\r\n    lectured.\r\n\r\n                                 BOSTON, November 29, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n    My Dear Sir,--I have received your favor of November 24, asking me\r\n    to appoint an evening in February or March to lecture before the\r\n    New Bedford Lyceum, in pursuance of my promise.\r\n\r\n    On receiving the invitation of your Lyceum, I felt flattered, and,\r\n    in undertaking to deliver a lecture at some time, to be appointed\r\n    afterwards, I promised myself peculiar pleasure in an occasion\r\n    of visiting a town which I had never seen, but whose refined\r\n    hospitality and liberal spirit, as described to me, awakened my\r\n    warmest interest.\r\n\r\n    Since then I have read in the public prints a protest, purporting\r\n    to be by gentlemen well known to me by reputation, who are members\r\n    of the Lyceum, and some of them part of its government, from\r\n    which it appears that in former years tickets of admission were\r\n    freely sold to colored persons, as to white persons, and that no\r\n    objection was made to them as members, but that at the present\r\n    time tickets are refused to colored persons, and membership is also\r\n    refused practically, though, by special vote recently adopted, they\r\n    are allowed to attend the lectures without expense, provided they\r\n    will sit in the north gallery.\r\n\r\n    From these facts it appears that the New Bedford Lyceum has\r\n    undertaken within its jurisdiction to establish a distinction of\r\n    _Caste_ not recognized before.\r\n\r\n    One of the cardinal truths of religion and freedom is the _Equality\r\n    and Brotherhood of Man_. In the sight of God and of all just\r\n    institutions the white man can claim no precedence or exclusive\r\n    privilege from his color. It is the accident of an accident\r\n    that places a human soul beneath the dark shelter of an African\r\n    countenance, rather than beneath our colder complexion. Nor can I\r\n    conceive any application of the divine injunction, Do unto others\r\n    as you would have them do unto you, more pertinent than to the man\r\n    who founds a discrimination between his fellow-men on difference of\r\n    skin.\r\n\r\n    It is well known that the prejudice of color, which is akin to\r\n    the stern and selfish spirit that holds a fellow-man in slavery,\r\n    is peculiar to our country. It does not exist in other civilized\r\n    countries. In France colored youths at college have gained the\r\n    highest honors, and been welcomed as if they were white. At the Law\r\n    School there I have sat with them on the same benches. In Italy\r\n    I have seen an Abyssinian mingling with monks, and there was no\r\n    apparent suspicion on either side of anything open to question. All\r\n    this was Christian: so it seemed to me.\r\n\r\n    In lecturing before a Lyceum which has introduced the prejudice of\r\n    color among its laws, and thus formally reversed an injunction of\r\n    highest morals and politics, I might seem to sanction what is most\r\n    alien to my soul, and join in disobedience to that command which\r\n    teaches that the children of earth are all of one blood. I cannot\r\n    do this.\r\n\r\n    I beg, therefore, to be excused at present from appointing a day\r\n    to lecture before your Lyceum; and I pray you to lay this letter\r\n    before the Lyceum, that the ground may be understood on which I\r\n    deem it my duty to decline the honor of appearing before them.\r\n\r\n    I hope you will pardon the frankness of this communication, and\r\n    believe me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\n                                      Very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  _To the Chairman of the Committee  }\r\n      of the New Bedford Lyceum._    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PRISONS AND PRISON DISCIPLINE.[120]\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE FROM THE CHRISTIAN EXAMINER, JANUARY, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with a feeling of deference that we welcome Miss Dix's \"Remarks\r\non Prisons and Prison Discipline.\" Her peculiar labors for humanity,\r\nand her renunciation of the refined repose which has such attractions\r\nfor her sex, to go about doing good, enduring the hardships of travel,\r\nthe vicissitudes of the changing season, and, more trying still, the\r\ncoldness of the world, awaken towards her a sense of gratitude, and\r\ninvest her name with an interest which must attach to anything from her\r\npen.\r\n\r\n    [120] 1. _Remarks on Prisons and Prison Discipline in the United\r\nStates._ By D.L.

Rarely is she able to mingle with effect in the\r\nactive labors which influence mankind. With incredulity we admire the\r\nfeminine expounder of the Roman law, illustrating by her lectures the\r\nUniversities of Padua and Bologna,--and the charities of St. Elizabeth\r\nof Hungary are legendary in the dim distance; though, in our own day,\r\nthe classical productions of the widow of Wyttenbach, crowned Doctor\r\nof Philosophy by the University of Marburg, and most especially the\r\nbeautiful labors of Mrs. Fry, recently closed by death, are examples\r\nof the sway exerted by the gentler sex beyond the charmed circle of\r\ndomestic life. Among these Miss Dix will receive a place which her\r\nmodesty would forbid her to claim. Her name will be enrolled among\r\nbenefactors. It will be pronounced with gratitude, when heroes in the\r\nstrifes of politics and of war are disregarded or forgotten.\r\n\r\n    \"Can we forget the generous few\r\n     Who, touched with human woe, redressive sought\r\n     Into the horrors of the gloomy jail,\r\n     Unpitied and unheard, where misery moans,\r\n     Where sickness pines?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Dix's labors embrace penitentiaries, jails, alms-houses,\r\npoor-houses, and asylums for the insane, throughout the Northern\r\nand Middle States,--all of which she has visited, turning a face of\r\ngentleness towards crime, comforting the unfortunate, softening a hard\r\nlot, sweetening a bitter cup, while she obtained information of their\r\ncondition calculated to awaken the attention of the public. This labor\r\nof love she has pursued earnestly, devotedly, sparing neither time\r\nnor strength, neglecting no person, abject or lowly, frequenting the\r\ncells of all, and by word and deed seeking to strengthen their hearts.\r\nThe melody of her voice still sounds in our ears, as, standing in the\r\nlong corridor of the Philadelphia Penitentiary, she read a Psalm of\r\nconsolation; nor will that scene be effaced quickly from the memory\r\nof any then present. Her Memorials, addressed to the Legislatures of\r\ndifferent States, have divulged a mass of facts, derived from personal\r\nand most minute observation, particularly with regard to the treatment\r\nof the insane, which must arouse the sensibilities of a humane people.\r\nIn herself alone she is a whole Prison Discipline Society. To her\r\nvarious efforts may be applied, without exaggeration, those magical\r\nwords in which Burke commemorated the kindred charity of Howard, when\r\nhe says that he travelled, \"not to survey the sumptuousness of palaces\r\nor the stateliness of temples, not to make accurate measurements of\r\nthe remains of ancient grandeur nor to form a scale of the curiosity\r\nof modern art, not to collect medals or collate manuscripts, but to\r\ndive into the depths of dungeons, to plunge into the infection of\r\nhospitals, to survey the mansions of sorrow and pain, to take the gauge\r\nand dimensions of misery, depression, and contempt, to remember the\r\nforgotten, to attend to the neglected, to visit the forsaken, and to\r\ncompare and collate the distresses of all men.\"\r\n\r\nHer \"Remarks\" contain general results on different points connected\r\nwith the discipline of prisons: as, the duration of sentences;\r\npardons and the pardoning power; diet of prisoners; water; clothing;\r\nventilation; heat; health; visitors' fees; dimensions of lodging-cells\r\nin the State penitentiaries; moral, religious, and general instruction\r\nin prisons; reformation of prisoners; penitentiary systems of the\r\nUnited States; and houses of refuge for juvenile offenders. It would\r\nbe interesting and instructive to examine the conclusions on all these\r\nimportant topics having the sanction of her disinterested experience;\r\nbut our limits restrict us, on the present occasion, to a single topic.\r\n\r\nWe are disposed to take advantage of the interest Miss Dix's\r\npublication may excite, and also of her name, which is an authority, to\r\nsay a few words on a question much agitated, and already the subject of\r\nmany books,--the comparative merits of what are called the Pennsylvania\r\nand Auburn Penitentiary Systems. This question is, perhaps, the most\r\nimportant of all that grow out of Prisons; for it affects, in a\r\nmeasure, all others. It involves both the construction of the prison,\r\nand its administration.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Prison Discipline, and particularly the question between\r\nthe two systems, has of late years occupied the attention of jurists\r\nand philanthropists in no ordinary degree. The discussion has been\r\nconducted in all the languages of Europe, to such an extent that the\r\ntitles alone of the works would occupy considerable space in a volume\r\nof Bibliography. We have before us, for instance, a list of no less\r\nthan eleven in Italian. But we must go back to the last century, if we\r\nwould trace the origin of the controversy.\r\n\r\nTo Howard, a man of true greatness, whose name will stand high on\r\nthe roll of the world's benefactors, belongs the signal honor of\r\nfirst awakening the sympathies of the English people in this work\r\nof benevolence. By his travels and labors he became familiar with\r\nthe actual character of prisons, and was enabled to spread before\r\nthe public an accumulation of details which fill the reader with\r\nhorror and disgust. The condition of prisons at that time in England\r\nwas appalling. Of course there was no system; nor was there any\r\ncivilization in the treatment of prisoners. Everything was bad. As\r\nthere was no care, so there was no cleanliness, on which so much\r\ndepends, and there was no classification or separation of any kind.\r\nAll commingled, so that the uncleanness of one befouled all, and the\r\nwickedness of one contaminated all. While this continued, all hope of\r\nreform was vain. Therefore, with especial warmth, Howard pleaded for\r\nthe _separation_ of prisoners, especially at night, \"wishing to have so\r\nmany small rooms or cabins that each criminal may sleep alone,\"[121]\r\nand called attention to the fact he had observed in Holland, that \"in\r\nmost of the prisons for criminals there are so many rooms that each\r\nprisoner is kept separate.\"[122]\r\n\r\n    [121] Howard, State of the Prisons, p. 22.\r\n\r\n    [122] Ibid. p. 45.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the principle of separation was first recognized\r\nat Rome, as long ago as 1703, by Clement XI., in the foundation\r\nof the Hospital of St. Michael, or the House of Refuge, where a\r\nseparate dormitory was provided for each prisoner. Over the portal\r\nof this asylum, in letters of gold, were inscribed the words of\r\nwisdom which Howard adopted as the motto of his labors, and which\r\nindicate the spirit that should preside over the administration of all\r\nprisons: _Parum est improbos coercere poena, nisi probos efficias\r\ndisciplina_,--It is of small consequence to coerce the wicked by\r\npunishment, unless you make them good by discipline. The first and\r\nmost important step in this discipline is to remove prisoners from all\r\nevil influence,--which can be done only by separation from each other,\r\nand by filling their time with labor.\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of this principle, and that he might reduce it to\r\npractice, Howard, in conjunction with Sir William Blackstone, as early\r\nas 1779, drew an Act of Parliament, the preamble to the fifth section\r\nof which is an enunciation of the cardinal truth at the foundation of\r\nall effective prison discipline.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas,\" says the Act, \"if many offenders, convicted of crimes\r\nfor which transportation hath been usually inflicted, _were ordered\r\nto solitary imprisonment, accompanied by well-regulated labor and\r\nreligious instruction_, it might be the means, under Providence, not\r\nonly of deterring others from the commission of the like crimes,\r\n_but also of reforming the individuals_,\" etc. Noble words! Here,\r\nfor the first time in English legislation, the reformation of\r\nthe prisoner is proposed as a distinct object. This Act, though\r\npassed, was unfortunately never carried into execution, through the\r\nperverseness, it is said, of one of the persons associated with Howard\r\nas commissioner for erecting a suitable prison.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1790 a law was passed in Pennsylvania, which is of\r\nimportance in the history of this subject, showing appreciation of the\r\nprinciple of seclusion with labor. In the preamble it is declared, that\r\nprevious laws for the punishment of criminals had failed of success,\r\n\"from the _communication_ with each other not being sufficiently\r\nrestrained within the places of confinement, and it is hoped _that the\r\naddition of unremitted solitude to laborious employment_, as far as\r\nit can be effected, will contribute as much to reform as to deter\",\r\nand the Act further provides, that certain persons shall be \"_kept\r\nseparate and apart from each other_, as much as the convenience of the\r\nbuilding will admit.\" The principle of separation, when first announced\r\nby Howard, and practically attempted in Pennsylvania, was imperfectly\r\nunderstood. It was easy to see the importance of separation; but how\r\nshould it be applied? In Pennsylvania it was attempted at first with\r\nsuch rigor as to justify its designation as the _Solitary System_. But\r\nas the new penitentiary in Philadelphia was about to be occupied, a\r\nlaw was passed providing that after July 1st, 1829, convicts should,\r\n\"instead of the penitentiary punishments heretofore prescribed, be\r\nsentenced to suffer punishment by _separate_ or solitary confinement at\r\n_labor_\"; and there is further provision for \"visits to the prisoners.\"\r\nHere were the two elements,--first, of labor, and, secondly, of\r\nvisits. In pursuance of this Act, that penitentiary was organized at\r\nPhiladelphia which afforded the first example on an extended scale of\r\nthe absolute separation of convicts from each other, combined with\r\nlabor. And this penitentiary has given its name to the class of prisons\r\nfounded on this principle.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that this system is distinguishable from\r\none of _solitary_ confinement with labor,--much more from one of mere\r\nsolitary confinement without labor. An intemperate opponent, too rash\r\nor prejudiced to recognize all the truth, has often characterized the\r\npresent Pennsylvania system as the _Solitary System_, and by this term\r\nnot unfrequently aroused a feeling against it which must disappear\r\nbefore a candid inquiry. It is easy to condemn any system of absolute\r\nsolitude without solace of labor or society. The examples of history\r\nrise in judgment against such. Who can forget the Bastile? We have the\r\ntestimony of Lafayette, whose own further experience at Olmütz should\r\nnot be neglected, as to its effect. \"I repaired to the scene,\" he says,\r\n\"on the second day of the demolition, and found that all the prisoners\r\nhad been deranged by their solitary confinement, except one. He had\r\nbeen a prisoner twenty-five years, and was led forth during the height\r\nof the tumultuous riot of the people, whilst engaged in tearing down\r\nthe building. He looked around with amazement, for he had seen nobody\r\nfor that space of time, and before night he was so much affected that\r\nhe became a confirmed maniac.\" But the Bastile is not the only prison\r\nwhose stones, could they speak, would tell this fearful tale; nor is\r\nLafayette the only reporter.\r\n\r\nNames often have the importance of things; and it cannot be doubted\r\nthat the ignorant or dishonest application of the term _solitary_ to\r\nthe Pennsylvania system is a strong reason for the opposition it has\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nThe _Separate System_ has but one essential condition,--the absolute\r\nseparation of prisoners from intercourse of any kind with each other.\r\nOn this may be engrafted labor, instruction, and even constant society\r\nwith officers of the prison, or with virtuous persons. In fact, these\r\nhave become, in greater or less degree, component parts of the system.\r\nIn constant employment the prisoner finds peace, and in the society\r\nwith which he is indulged innocent relaxation and healthy influence.\r\nThis is the Pennsylvania system.\r\n\r\nThere is another and rival system, first established in the _Maison de\r\nForce_ at Ghent, but borrowing its name from the Auburn Penitentiary\r\nof New York, where it was first introduced in 1816, by a remarkable\r\ndisciplinarian, Elam Lynds. Here the prisoners are separated only at\r\nnight, each sleeping in a small cell or dormitory by himself. During\r\nthe day they labor together in shops, or in the open air, according to\r\nthe nature of the work,--being prohibited from speaking to each other,\r\nunder pain of punishment. From the latter feature this is often called\r\nthe _Silent System_. As its chief peculiarity, in contradistinction\r\nto the _Separate System_, is the working of prisoners in assemblies,\r\nwhere all see and are seen, it may be more properly designated the\r\n_Congregate System_.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, are these two systems, which, it will be observed,\r\nboth aim at the same object, _the separation of prisoners so that\r\nthey can have no intercourse with each other_. In the one this end is\r\nattained by their physical separation from each other both night and\r\nday; in the other, by such separation at night, with untiring watch by\r\nday to prevent intercourse. Of course, separation by the Congregate\r\nsystem is less complete than by the other. Conversation by words\r\nmay be restrained; though it is now admitted that no guardian can\r\nbe sufficiently watchful to intercept on all occasions those winged\r\nmessengers. The extensive unspoken, unwritten language of signs, the\r\nexpression of the countenance, the movements of the body, may telegraph\r\nfrom convict to convict thoughts of stubbornness, hatred, or revenge.\r\n\r\nIf separation be desirable, should it not be complete? Should not the\r\nconducting wires be broken, so that no electrical spark may propagate\r\nits disturbing force? But the very pains taken in the Congregate system\r\nto insure silence by day and separation by night answer this question.\r\nThus, by strange inconsistency, the advocates of the _Congregate_\r\nsystem seek to enforce _separation_. Wedded to an imperfect practice,\r\nthey recognize the correct principle.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding farther with this comparison it is proper to glance\r\nat the real objects of prison discipline, that we may be better enabled\r\nto determine which system is best calculated to answer these objects.\r\n\r\nThree things are proposed by every enlightened system: first, to deter\r\nothers from crime; secondly, to prevent the offender from preying\r\nagain upon society; thirdly, discipline and care, so far as possible\r\nto promote reformation. There are grounds for belief that the first\r\ntwo purposes are best attained by the Separate system; but without\r\nconsidering these particularly, let us pass to the question, Which is\r\nbest calculated to perform that truly heavenly function of reforming\r\nthe offender?\r\n\r\nIs not the answer prompt and decisive in favor of that system which\r\nmost completely protects the prisoner from the pernicious influence of\r\nbrethren in guilt? It is a venerable proverb, that a man is known by\r\nthe company he keeps; and this is a homely expression of the truth,\r\nthat the character of a man is naturally in harmony with those about\r\nhim. If the society about him is virtuous, his own virtues will be\r\nconfirmed and expanded; on the other hand, if it be wicked, then will\r\nthe demon of his nature be aroused. Bad qualities, as well as good,\r\nare quickened and strengthened under the influence of society. Every\r\nassociation of prisoners must pervert, in greater or less degree, but\r\ncan never reform, those of whom it is composed. The obdurate offender,\r\nperpetually brooding on evil, even though he utter no audible word,\r\nwill impart to the congregation something of his own hardness of\r\nheart. Are we not told by the poet, that sheep and swine take contagion\r\nfrom one of their number, and even a grape is spoiled by another grape?\r\n\r\n    \"Dedit hanc contagio labem,\r\n     Et dabit in plures; sicut grex totus in agris\r\n     Unius scabie cadit, et porrigine porci,\r\n    _Uvaque conspecta livorem ducit ab uva_.\"[123]\r\n\r\n    [123] Juv., Sat. II. 78-81.\r\n\r\nFrom the inherent nature of things, this contagion must be propagated\r\nby the Congregate system, while the Separate system does all that man\r\ncan do to restrain it. By the latter, as successfully administered,\r\nthe prisoner is, in the first place, withdrawn, so far as possible by\r\nhuman means, from all bad influences, while, in the second place, he is\r\nbrought under the operation of good influences. The mind is naturally\r\ndiverted from thick-coming schemes of crime, and turned to thoughts\r\nof virtue. What in it is bad, if not entirely subdued, is weakened by\r\ninactivity, while the good is prompted to constant exercise.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be questioned, then, on grounds of reason, independent of\r\nexperience, that the Separate system is better calculated to promote\r\nthat great object of Prison Discipline, the reformation of the\r\noffender. With this recommendation alone it would be entitled to the\r\nregard of all who feel that the return of a single sinner is blessed.\r\n\r\nBut a further object is secured. As the prisoners never see one\r\nanother, they leave the penitentiary, at the expiration of their\r\npunishment, literally unknowing and unknown. In illustration of\r\nthis fact, the delightful incident is mentioned, that the keeper of\r\nthe Philadelphia Penitentiary once recognized three persons at the\r\nsame place, engaged in honest labor, who had been in his custody as\r\nconvicts, though neither knew the career of the other two. Discharged\r\nprisoners are thus enabled to slide back into the community, without\r\nthe chilling fear of untimely recognition by those with whom they\r\ncongregated in the penitentiary. They cannot escape the memory of the\r\npunishment they have endured; but the brand is not upon the forehead.\r\nThey are encouraged to honest exertion by the hope of retrieving, on a\r\ndistant spot and under a new name, the fair character they have lost;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, if evil-minded, they have no associations of\r\nthe prison to renew, or to stimulate to conspiracy against society.\r\n\r\nA system of Prison Discipline with these benign features must long ago\r\nhave commended itself to general acceptance, if it had not been opposed\r\nwith exceptional ardor on grounds which, though in reality little\r\ntenable, are calculated to exercise influence over the ignorance and\r\nprejudice of men.\r\n\r\nThe first objection is, that it is productive of insanity, from an\r\nunnatural deprivation of society. However just this may be when\r\ndirected against the Solitary system, it is inapplicable to what is\r\ncalled the Separate system, which does not exclude the idea of society,\r\nand, as practically administered at Philadelphia and elsewhere,\r\nsupplies both society and labor in ample measure. If the prisoner is\r\nnot indulged with society enough, it is a fault in the administration\r\nof the system, and not in the system itself. In the publications of the\r\nBoston Prison Discipline Society, elaborate tables have been arranged\r\nshowing a tendency to insanity in the Penitentiary at Philadelphia;\r\nbut careful and candid inquiry will demonstrate that these are founded\r\nin misapprehension, and will exonerate that institution from such\r\nimputation. The highest authorities in medicine have distinctly\r\ndeclared, that the Separate system, if properly administered, with\r\nlabor and conversation, does not affect the reason. The names of\r\nEsquirol and Louis give to this opinion the strongest sanction of\r\nscience throughout the civilized world. The same conclusion was\r\naffirmed with precision and fervor by Lélut, in an elaborate memoir\r\nbefore the Institute of France, and also by the Scientific Congress\r\nassembled at Padua in 1843, and at Lucca in 1844.\r\n\r\nThe second objection charges the Separate system with being unfavorable\r\nto health, as compared with the Congregate system. In reply we merely\r\nsay, that the great names in medicine to which we have already referred\r\nexpressly deny that it has any influence in shortening life; while\r\na statistical comparison of several penitentiaries conducted on the\r\nCongregate system with the Philadelphia Penitentiary attests the\r\nsuperiority of the latter in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe third and last objection is founded on the increased expense of the\r\nSeparate system. The Congregate system is recommended by suggestions of\r\neconomy and clamors of cupidity. It is said to be put into operation at\r\nless cost, and afterwards to support itself, and even to bring profit\r\nto the State. We are sorry to believe that this consideration has had\r\nan extensive influence. It is humiliating to suppose that Government\r\nwould hesitate to adopt a system founded on enlightened humanity\r\nbecause another might be had for less money,--counting the unworthy\r\ngain or the petty economy as of higher consequence than the reformation\r\nof an offender. Such a course were unworthy of our civilization.\r\nThe State has sacred duties to the unfortunate men it takes into its\r\ncustody. It must see not only that they receive no harm, but that they\r\nenjoy all means of improvement consistent with their condition,--that,\r\nwhile their bodies are clothed and fed, their souls are not left naked\r\nand hungry. It assumes the place of parent, and owes a parent's care\r\nand kindness; or rather, when we consider that the State itself is\r\nchild of the people, may we not say that it should emulate that famous\r\nRoman charity, so often illustrated by Art, which descended into the\r\ndarkness of a dungeon, to afford an exuberant, health-giving bosom to\r\nthe exhausted being from whom it drew its own life.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the uncompromising hostility the Separate system has\r\nencountered, it wins constant favor. Many prisons are built on this\r\nplan, and experience comes to confirm the suggestions of humanity and\r\nscience. The Penitentiary at Philadelphia, which first proved its\r\nsuperiority, was followed in 1833 by one at Pittsburg and by a County\r\nPrison at Alleghany, and in 1841 by another County Prison, on the same\r\nsystem, at Harrisburg. In 1834 New Jersey followed the example of\r\nher neighbor State, and established a penitentiary on this system at\r\nTrenton.\r\n\r\nCommissions from foreign governments, after visiting the different\r\nprisons of the United States, have all reported _emphatically_ in favor\r\nof the Separate system: as, that of Beaumont and De Tocqueville to the\r\nFrench Government, in 1831; of Mr. Crawford to the English, in 1834; of\r\nDr. Julius to the Prussian, in 1836, after a most careful perambulation\r\nof all the prisons of the country; of Demetz and Blouet to the French,\r\nin 1837,--being the second Commission from the same Government; and of\r\nNeilson and Mondelet to the Canadian Government, in 1836.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these recommendations, numerous prisons have been\r\nbuilt or are now building in Europe. In England a model prison has\r\nbeen constructed at Pentonville, which is perhaps the best prison in\r\nthe world. In the late Report of the Surveyor-General of Prisons, laid\r\non the table of Parliament during its last session, it was expressly\r\ndeclared, from the experience gained in the Pentonville prison, \"that\r\nthe separation of one prisoner from another is indispensable as the\r\nbasis of any sound system.\" As long ago as 1843, no less than seventeen\r\nprisons on this principle were built or building in different counties\r\nof England, and several in Scotland. In France the whole subject has\r\nundergone most thorough discussion by the press, and also in debate\r\nby the Chamber of Deputies. Among the works now before us is a volume\r\nof more than six hundred pages, filled by a report of this debate,\r\nwith notes, which ended in the passage of a law during the last summer\r\nappropriating ninety millions of francs for the building of thirty\r\nprisons on the Separate system. Such is the testimony of France and\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nSimilar testimony comes from other quarters: from Prussia, where five\r\nprisons on this system have been built; from Denmark, where ten are\r\nnow building; from Sweden, where eight are building under the auspices\r\nof the monarch, who, when Prince Oscar, wrote ably in advocacy of\r\nthe Separate system; from Norway, where one is now building in the\r\nneighborhood of Christiania; from Poland, where one has long been in\r\nexistence, and three others are nearly completed; from Hungary, where\r\na project has been submitted to the Diet for the erection of ten on the\r\nSeparate system; from Holland, where one is about to be erected on the\r\nplan of Pentonville; from Belgium, which has yielded to the Separate\r\nsystem, and has even engrafted it upon the famous _Maison de Force_ at\r\nGhent, the model of our Auburn Prison; from the Duchy of Nassau; from\r\nthe Grand Duchy of Baden; from Frankfort-on-the-Main; from Hamburg;\r\nfrom Geneva, in Switzerland: in all of which prisons on this system are\r\nbuilt or are building. From poor, distracted Spain proceeds the same\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nTo this array of authorities and examples may be added two names\r\nof commanding weight in all matters of Prison Discipline,--Edward\r\nLivingston and Miss Dix. The first, whose high fortune it was to refine\r\njurisprudence by his philanthropy, as he had illumined it by his genius\r\nand strengthened it by his learning, in his Introductory Report to the\r\nCode of Prison Discipline, as long ago as 1827, urged with classical\r\neloquence a system of \"seclusion, accompanied by moral, religious,\r\nand scientific instruction, and useful manual labor.\" Miss Dix, after\r\nattentive survey of different systems throughout our country, fervently\r\nenforces, as well in the publication now before us as in her Memorials,\r\nthe merits of the Separate system, and of its administration in\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIt might be said that the voices of civilized nations, by a rare\r\nharmony, concurred in sanctioning the Separate system, if the Boston\r\nPrison Discipline Society had not raised a persistent note of discord,\r\nwhich has gone on with a most unmusical _crescendo_. As the solitary\r\nchampion of an imperfect system which the world is renouncing, it\r\nhas contended with earnestness, which has often become prejudice,\r\nand with insensibility to accumulating facts, which was injustice.\r\nWith frankness, as with sorrow, we allude to the sinister influence\r\nit has exercised over this question, particularly throughout the\r\nNorthern States. But the truth which has been proclaimed abroad need\r\nnot be delicately minced at home. We do not join with the recent\r\nEnglish writer, who, among many harsher suggestions, speaks of the\r\n\"misrepresentation,\" the \"trickery,\" the \"imposture\"[124] of the\r\nSociety or its agent,--nor with Moreau-Christophe, who says, \"_La\r\nSociété des Prisons à Boston a juré haine à mort au système de\r\nPhiladelphie_\";[125] for we know well the honesty and sincere interest\r\nin the welfare of prisoners which animate its Secretary, and we feel\r\npersuaded that he will gladly abandon the deadly war which he wages\r\nagainst the Separate system, when he sees it as it is now regarded by\r\nthe science and humanity of the civilized world. But we feel that his\r\nexertions, which in some departments of Prison Discipline have been\r\nproductive of incalculable good, for which his memory will be blessed,\r\non this important question have done harm. In his Reports he has never\r\nfailed to present all the evil of the Separate system, particularly\r\nas administered in Philadelphia, sometimes even drawing upon his\r\nimagination for facts, while he has carefully withheld the testimony in\r\nits favor. This beneficent system and its meritorious supporters are\r\nheld up to obloquy, and the wide circle that confided implicitly in his\r\nReports are consigned to darkness with regard to its true character and\r\nits general reception abroad.\r\n\r\n    [124] Adshead, pp. 127, 129.\r\n\r\n    [125] Revue Pénitentiaire, Tom. II. p. 589.\r\n\r\nOne of the most strenuous advocates of the Separate system at the\r\npresent moment, whose work of elaborate argument and detail now lies\r\nbefore us, is Suringar, called sometimes the Howard of Holland, who\r\nhad signalized himself by previous opposition to it. He says, \"I am\r\nnow completely emancipated from my former error. This error I do not\r\nblush to confess openly. The same change has been wrought in the\r\nopinions of Julius in Prussia, of Crawford in England, of Bérenger\r\nand Demetz in France, and of all men of good faith, who are moved, in\r\ntheir researches, only by the suggestions of conscience, unswayed by\r\nprejudice or pride of opinion.\" Perhaps in these changes of opinion the\r\nSecretary of the Boston Prison Discipline Society may find an example\r\nwhich he will not be unwilling to follow; and it may be for us to\r\nwelcome him as a cordial fellow-laborer in the conscientious support of\r\nwhat he has for a long period most conscientiously attacked.\r\n\r\nFrom this rapid survey it will be seen that our convictions and\r\nsympathies are with the Separate system. Nothing in Prison Discipline\r\nseems clearer than the general duty of removing prisoners from the\r\ncorrupting influence of association, even though silent. But we are not\r\ninsensible to the encouragement and succor which prisoners might derive\r\nfrom companionship with those struggling like themselves. It was a wise\r\nremark of the English Professor, that \"students are the best professors\r\nto each other\"; and the experience of Mrs. Farnham, the matron of\r\nthe female convicts at Sing-Sing, shows that this same principle is\r\nnot without its effect even among classes of convicts. Perhaps the\r\nSeparate system might be modified, so as to admit instruction and labor\r\ntogether, in a small class, selected after a probationary period of\r\nseparation, as specially worthy of this indulgence and confidence. Such\r\na modification was contemplated and recommended by Mr. Livingston, and\r\nwould seem to find favor with Von Raumer in his recent work on America.\r\nThis privilege can be imparted to those only who have shown themselves\r\nso exemplary that their society seems to be uncontaminating. But it\r\nremains to be seen whether there is any subtile alchemy by which their\r\npurity may be determined, so as to justify a departure from the general\r\nrule of separation.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would commend this subject to the attention of all. In\r\nthe language of Sir Michael Foster, a judge of eminence in the last\r\ncentury, \"No rank or condition of life, no uprightness of heart, no\r\nprudence or circumspection of conduct, should teach any man to conclude\r\nthat he may not one day be deeply interested in these researches.\"\r\nThere are considerations of self-interest which may move those who\r\ndo not incline to labor for others, unless with ultimate advantage\r\nto themselves. But all of true benevolence, and justly appreciating\r\nthe duties of the State, will join in effort for the poor prisoner,\r\nderiving from his inferior condition new motives to action, that it may\r\nbe true of the State, as of law, that the very least feels its care,\r\nas the greatest is not exempt from its power. In the progress of an\r\nenlightened Prison Discipline, it may be hoped that our penitentiaries\r\nwill become in reality, if not in name, Houses of Reformation, and that\r\nconvicts will be treated with scrupulous regard for their well-being,\r\nphysical, moral, and intellectual, to the end, that, when they are\r\nallowed to mingle again with society, they may feel sympathy with\r\nvirtue and detestation of vice, and, when wiser, may be better men.\r\n\r\nIn the promotion of this cause, the city of Boston at this moment\r\noccupies a position of signal advantage. It has determined to erect a\r\nnew county jail, and the plans are still under consideration. It is\r\neasy to perceive that the plan it adopts and the system of discipline\r\nit recognizes will become an example. No narrow prejudice and no\r\nunworthy economy should prevent the example from being such as becomes\r\na city of the wealth, refinement, and humanity of Boston. It is a\r\ncommon boast, that her schools and various institutions of beneficence\r\nare the best in the world. The prison about to be erected should share\r\nthis boast. _Let it be the best in the world._ Let it be the model\r\nprison, not only to our own country, but to other countries. The rule\r\nof separation, considered of such importance among the ripe convicts of\r\nthe penitentiary, is of greater necessity still in a prison which will\r\nreceive before trial both innocent and guilty. From the first moment he\r\nis touched by the hand of the law, the prisoner should be cut off from\r\nall association, by word or sight, with fellow-prisoners. The State,\r\nas his temporary guardian, mindful of his weakness, owes him this\r\nprotection and this means of reformation.\r\n\r\nThe _absolute separation_ of prisoners, so that they can neither see,\r\nhear, nor touch each other, is the pole-star of Prison Discipline. It\r\nis the Alpha, or beginning, as the reformation of the offender is the\r\nOmega, or the end. It is this principle, when properly administered,\r\nwhich irradiates with heavenly light even the darkness of the\r\ndungeon, driving far away the intrusive legion of unclean thoughts,\r\nand introducing in their vacant place the purity of religion, the\r\nteachings of virtue, the solace of society, and the comfort of hope.\r\nIn this spirit let us build our prisons. The jail will no longer be a\r\ncharnel-house of living men; the cell will cease to be the tomb where\r\nis buried what is more precious than the body,--a human soul. From\r\ntheir iron gates let us erase that doom of despair,\r\n\r\n    \"All hope abandon, ye who enter in,\"\r\n\r\nand inscribe words of gentleness, encouragement, love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE EMPLOYMENT OF TIME.\r\n\r\n   LECTURE BEFORE THE BOSTON LYCEUM, DELIVERED IN THE FEDERAL STREET\r\n                      THEATRE, FEBRUARY 18, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have lost a day,\" was the exclamation of the virtuous Roman\r\nEmperor,--\"for on this day I have done no good thing.\" The Arch of\r\nTitus still stands midway between the Forum and the Colosseum, and the\r\ncurious traveller discerns the golden candlesticks of conquered Judæa\r\nsculptured on its marble sides; but this monument of triumph, and the\r\nmemory it perpetuates of the veteran legions of Rome and the twenty\r\ncohorts of allies before whose swords the sacred city yielded its life\r\nin terrible fire and blood, give not to the conqueror such true glory\r\nas springs from these words,--destined to endure long after the arch\r\nhas crumbled to dust, and when the triumph it seeks to perpetuate has\r\npassed from the minds of men. That day was not lost. On no day wast\r\nthou so great or beneficent as when thou gavest this eternal lesson\r\nto man. Across the ages it still reaches innumerable hearts, even as\r\nit penetrated the friendly bosoms that throbbed beneath its first\r\nutterance. The child learns it, and receives a new impulse to labor and\r\ngoodness. There are few, whether old or young, who do not recognize it\r\nas more than a victory.\r\n\r\nIf I undertake to dwell on the suggestions of this theme, it is because\r\nit seems to me especially appropriate to the young, at whose request\r\nI have the honor of appearing before you. My subject is the Value of\r\nTime, and the way in which it may be best employed. I shall attempt\r\nnothing elaborate, but simply gather together illustrations and\r\nexamples, which, though trite and familiar, will at least be practical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe value of time is one of our earliest lessons, taught at the\r\nmother's knee, even with the alphabet,--\"_S_ is a sluggard,\"--confirmed\r\nby the maxims of Poor Richard, printed at the end of almanacs, and\r\nstamped on handkerchiefs,--further enforced by the examples of the\r\ncopy-book, as the young fingers first learn to join words together\r\nby the magical art of writing. Fable comes in aid of precept, and\r\nthe venerable figure of Time is depicted to the receptive, almost\r\nbelieving, imagination of childhood, as winged, and also bald on the\r\ntop and back of the head, with a single tuft of hair on the forehead,\r\nsignifying that whoso would detain it must seize it by the forelock.\r\nWith such lessons and pictures the child is trained. Moralist,\r\npreacher, and poet also enforce these teachings; and the improvement of\r\ntime, the importance of industry, and the excellence of labor become\r\ncommonplaces of exhortation.\r\n\r\nThe value of time has passed into a proverb,--\"Time is money.\" It is so\r\nbecause its employment brings money. But it is more. It is knowledge.\r\nStill more, it is virtue. Nor is it creditable to the character of\r\nthe world that the proverb has taken this material and mercenary\r\ncomplexion, as if money were the highest good and the strongest\r\nrecommendation. Time is more than money. It brings what money cannot\r\npurchase. It has in its lap all the learning of the Past, the spoils\r\nof Antiquity, the priceless treasures of knowledge. Who would barter\r\nthese for gold or silver? But knowledge is a means only, and not an\r\nend. It is valuable because it promotes the welfare, the development,\r\nand the progress of man. And the highest value of time is not even in\r\nknowledge, but in the opportunity of doing good.\r\n\r\nTime is opportunity. Little or much, it may be the occasion of\r\nusefulness. It is the point desired by the philosopher where to plant\r\nthe lever that shall move the world. It is the napkin in which are\r\nwrapped, not only the talent of silver, but the treasures of knowledge\r\nand the fruits of virtue. Saving time, we save all these. Employing\r\ntime to the best advantage, we exercise a true thrift. Here is a wise\r\nparsimony; here is a sacred avarice. To each of us the passing day is\r\nof the same dimensions, nor can any one by taking thought add a moment\r\nto its hours. But though unable to extend their duration, he may swell\r\nthem with works.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to say, \"Take care of the small sums, and the large\r\nwill take care of themselves.\" With equal wisdom and more necessity\r\nmay it be said, \"Watch the minutes, and the hours and days will be\r\nsafe.\" The moments are precious; they are gold filings, to be carefully\r\npreserved and melted into the rich ingot.\r\n\r\nTime is the measure of life on earth. Its enjoyment is life itself.\r\nIts divisions, its days, its hours, its minutes, are fractions of this\r\nheavenly gift. Every moment that flies over our heads takes from the\r\nfuture and gives to the irrevocable past, shortening by so much the\r\nmeasure of our days, abridging by so much the means of usefulness\r\ncommitted to our hands. Before the voice which now addresses you shall\r\ndie away in the air, another hour will have passed, and we shall all\r\nhave advanced by another stage towards the final goal on earth. Waste\r\nor sacrifice of time is, then, waste or sacrifice of life itself: it is\r\npartial suicide.\r\n\r\nThe moments lost in listlessness or squandered in unprofitable\r\ndissipation, gathered into aggregates, are hours, days, weeks, months,\r\nyears. The daily sacrifice of a single hour during a year comes at its\r\nend to thirty-six working days, allowing ten hours to the day,--an\r\namount of time, if devoted exclusively to one object, ample for the\r\nacquisition of important knowledge, and for the accomplishment of\r\ninconceivable good. Imagine, if you please, a solid month dedicated,\r\nwithout interruption, to a single purpose,--to the study of a new\r\nlanguage, an untried science, an unexplored field of history, a fresh\r\ndepartment of philosophy, or to some new sphere of action, some labor\r\nof humanity, some godlike charity,--and what visions must not rise of\r\nuntold accumulations of knowledge, of unnumbered deeds of goodness! Who\r\nof us does not each day, in manifold ways, sacrifice these precious\r\nmoments, these golden hours?\r\n\r\nThere is a legend of Mohammed which teaches how much may be crowded\r\ninto a moment. It is said that he was suddenly taken up by an angel,\r\nand borne beyond the naming bounds of space, where he beheld the\r\nwonders of Heaven and Hell, the bliss of the faithful and the torments\r\nof the damned in measureless variety, and was then returned to the spot\r\nof earth from which he had been lifted,--all in so short a time that\r\nthe water had not entirely run out of the pitcher which he let fall\r\nfrom his hands when he was borne upwards. But actual life furnishes\r\nillustrations of greater point. It is related of a celebrated French\r\njurist, one of the ornaments of the magistracy, that he composed a\r\nlearned and important work in the quarter hours that draggled between\r\ndinner ordered and dinner served. Napoleon directed one of his generals\r\nto move on a battery of the enemy, although reinforcements were in\r\nsight, saying, \"It will take them fifteen minutes to reach the point;\r\nI have always observed that these _fifteen minutes_ decide great\r\nbattles.\" In the currents of common life they are often as decisive as\r\nin the heady fight.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy, from literary and political history, from the lives\r\nof all who have excelled in any way, to accumulate illustrations of the\r\npower of industry. Among those who have achieved what the world calls\r\ngreatness, the list might be extended from Julius Cæsar to Napoleon,\r\nwhose feats of labor are among the marvels of history. Nor should\r\nwe forget Alfred, the father of English civilization, whose better\r\nfame testifies also to the wise employment of time. Our own country,\r\nthis very town, furnishes a renowned example in Benjamin Franklin.\r\nHere I pronounce a name which has its own familiar echoes. His early\r\nstudies, when a printer's boy,--his singular experience of life in its\r\nextremes,--sounding in childhood all the humilities, as in maturer\r\nyears he reached all that was exalted in place,--the truant boy become\r\na teacher to the nations, and pouring light upon the highest schools of\r\nscience and philosophy, touching the throne with hands once blackened\r\nby types and ink,--all this must be present to you. His first and\r\nconstant talisman was industry. The autobiography in which he has\r\nrecorded his progress in knowledge is a remarkable composition, where\r\nthe style flows like a brook of transparent water, without a ripple on\r\nits smooth surface. Perhaps no single book has had greater influence\r\nin quickening labor and the rigid economy of time, overcoming all\r\nobstacles, among those whose early life has been chilled by penury or\r\ndarkened by neglect. But we must qualify our praise. It cannot fail\r\nto be regretted that the lessons taught by Franklin are so little\r\nspiritual in their character,--that they are so material, so mundane,\r\nso full of pounds, shillings, and pence. \"The Almighty Dollar,\" now\r\nruling here with sovereign sway and masterdom, was placed on the throne\r\nby Poor Richard. When shall it be dethroned? When shall the thoughts,\r\nthe aspirations, the politics of the land be lifted from the mere greed\r\nof gain, with an appetite that grows by what it feeds on, into the\r\nserene region of inflexible justice and universal benevolence? Could\r\nwe imagine the thrift, the worldly wisdom, the practical sense, the\r\ninventive genius of Franklin, softened, exalted, illumined, inspired\r\nby the imagination, the grace, the sensibility, the heavenly spirit\r\nof Channing, we should behold a character under whose influence our\r\ncountry would advance at once in all spiritual as well as material\r\nprosperity,--where money should not be the \"main chance,\" but truth,\r\njustice, righteousness, drawing in their train all the goods of earth,\r\nand reflecting all the blessings of heaven. Then would time be the best\r\nally of man, and no day would pass without some good thing done.\r\n\r\nAmong the contemporaries of Franklin in England, unlike in the\r\npatrician circumstances of his birth, education, and life, most unlike\r\nin his topics of thought and study, but resembling him in the diligence\r\nand constancy of labor marking his career, was Edward Gibbon, author of\r\nthe History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. He also has\r\nleft behind an autobiography,--in style and tone how unlike the simple\r\nnarrative of Franklin!--where in living colors are depicted the labors\r\nand delights of a scholar's life. This book has always seemed to me,\r\nmore than any other in the English language, calculated to enkindle the\r\nlove of learning, and to train the student for its pursuit. Here he\r\nwill find an example and guide in the various fields of scholarship,\r\nwho will challenge his admiration in proportion as he shares the same\r\ngenerous aspiration. The autobiographies of Gibbon and Franklin are\r\ncomplements of each other. They teach the same lesson of labor and\r\nstudy in different spheres of life and to different classes of minds.\r\nBoth have rare excellence as compositions, and constitute important\r\ncontributions to that literature which illustrates the employment of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThere is another character, of our own age, whose example is, perhaps,\r\nmore direct and practical, especially as described by himself: I mean\r\nWilliam Cobbett. To appreciate this example, you must know something of\r\nhis long life, from early and inauspicious youth to venerable years,\r\nfilled always with labors various, incessant, and Herculean, under\r\nwhich his elastic nature seemed to rise with renewed strength. He\r\ndied in 1835, supposed to be seventy-three years of age, although the\r\nexact date of his birth was never known, and such was the position he\r\nhad acquired that he was characterized at that time, even by hostile\r\npens, as one of the most remarkable men whom England, fertile in\r\nintellectual excellence, ever produced. The lapse of little more than\r\nten years has begun to obscure his memory. It will be for posterity to\r\ndetermine whether he has connected his name with those great causes\r\nof human improvement which send their influence to future ages, and\r\nare destined to be the only consideration on which fame hereafter will\r\nbe awarded or preserved. But the memory of his labors, and the voice\r\nof encouragement to the poor and lowly which sounds throughout his\r\nwritings, must always be refreshing to those whose hopes of future\r\nusefulness are clouded by discouragement and poverty. There can be none\r\nso humble as not to derive succor from his example. He was conscious\r\neven to vanity of his own large powers, and at the close of his long\r\ncareer surveyed his succession of labors--the hundred volumes from his\r\nsleepless pen, and the wide influence they had exercised--with the\r\nself-gratulation of the miser in counting his stores of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThe son of a poor farmer, at the age of twenty he ran away from\r\nthe paternal acres, and became for a short time copying-clerk to a\r\nlawyer, but, tiring soon of these duties, he enlisted in the army and\r\nfound himself private in a regiment at Chatham, which was ordered to\r\nAmerica. His merit soon raised him to the rank of corporal, and then\r\nof sergeant-major. At this time he saw his future wife and the mother\r\nof his children. The circumstances of this meeting, as described by\r\nhimself in his own peculiar style, belong to this picture, while\r\nthey illustrate the subject. \"When I first saw my wife,\" he writes,\r\n\"she was thirteen years old, and I was within a month of twenty-one.\r\nShe was the daughter of a sergeant-major of artillery, and I was the\r\nsergeant-major of a regiment of foot, both stationed in forts near the\r\ncity of St. John, in the province of New Brunswick. I sat in the same\r\nroom with her for about an hour, in company with others, and I made up\r\nmy mind that she was the very girl for me. That I thought her beautiful\r\nis certain, for that I had always said should be an indispensable\r\nqualification; but I saw in her what I deemed marks of that sobriety\r\nof conduct of which I have said so much, and which has been by far the\r\ngreatest blessing of my life. It was now dead of winter, and of course\r\nthe snow several feet deep on the ground, and the weather piercing\r\ncold. It was my habit, when I had done my morning's writing, to go\r\nout at break of day to take a walk on a hill at the foot of which our\r\nbarracks lay. In about three mornings after I had first seen her, I\r\nhad, by an invitation to breakfast with me, got up two young men to\r\njoin me in my walk, and our road lay by the house of her father and\r\nmother. It was hardly light, but she was out on the snow, scrubbing\r\nout a washing-tub. 'That's the girl for me!' said I, when we had got\r\nout of her hearing.\"[126] To her he plighted faith. After eight years\r\nof service in the army, and his return to England, he obtained his\r\ndischarge and married her.\r\n\r\n    [126] Life, pp. 44, 45.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 Cobbett came to the United States, living in Philadelphia,\r\nwhere he was bookseller, publisher, author, and libeller by profession.\r\nAs \"Peter Porcupine\" he is well known. He shot his sharp and malicious\r\nquills at the most estimable characters,--Franklin, Jefferson,\r\nGallatin, Priestley, and even the sacred name of Washington. A heavy\r\njudgment for libel hanging suspended over him, he fled from America,\r\nand from the justice he had aroused, to commence in England a fresh\r\ncareer of unquestioned talents, unaccountable inconsistency, and\r\ninexhaustible malignity.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in England Cobbett attached himself warmly to the\r\ninterests of Mr. Pitt, in whose behalf he wielded for a while his\r\nuntiring pen. At the same time he commenced business as bookseller, in\r\nwhich he soon failed. In politics he showed himself more Tory than the\r\nmost Tory. Mr. Windham, in the House of Commons, made the remarkable\r\ndeclaration, that \"he merited a statue of gold.\"[127] His Letters on\r\nthe Treaty of Amiens produced a sensation throughout Europe.[128] The\r\ncelebrated Swiss historian, Von Müller, pronounced them more eloquent\r\nthan anything since Demosthenes. How transitory is fame! These Letters,\r\nonce so much admired, which, with profane force, helped to burst open\r\nthe Temple of Janus, happily closed by peace, are now forgotten. I do\r\nnot know that they are to be found in any library in this part of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n    [127] Speech, August 5, 1803: Hansard, XXXVI. 1679.\r\n\r\n    [128] Letters to the Right Honorable Lord Hawkesbury and to the Right\r\nHonorable Henry Addington, on the Peace with Buonaparté; to which is\r\nadded an Appendix. London, 1802.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that he commenced his \"Weekly Political\r\nRegister,\" which for more than thirty years was the vehicle of his\r\nopinions and feelings. But the pungent Toryism with which he began his\r\ncareer was changed into a more pungent Liberalism; from the oil of\r\nConservatism he passed to the vinegar of Dissent. He saw all things\r\nin a new light, and with unsparing criticism pursued the men he had\r\nrecently extolled. His Ishmael pen was turned against every man. He\r\nwrote with the hardihood of a pirate and the ardor of a patriot. At\r\nlength he was convicted of libel, and sentenced to pay a fine of a\r\nthousand pounds and to be imprisoned for two years. This severe\r\nincarceration he never forgave or forgot. With thoughts of vengeance\r\nhe emerged from his prison to unaccustomed popularity. His \"Register,\"\r\ninto which, as into a seething caldron, he weekly poured the venom of\r\nhis pen, reached the unprecedented circulation of one hundred thousand,\r\nan audience greater than was ever before addressed by saint or sinner.\r\nThe soul swells in the contemplation of the good that might have been\r\nwrought by a spirit elevated to the high purpose, having access to so\r\nmany human hearts. His pen waxing in inveteracy, and himself becoming\r\ndaily more obnoxious to the Government, in 1817, by timely flight, he\r\nwithdrew from the threatening storm, and sought shelter in the United\r\nStates, where he lingered, principally on Long Island, till 1819, when\r\nhe wandered back to England, there to renew his strifes and ruffle\r\nagain the waters of political controversy. As late as 1831, he was, for\r\nthe eighth time in his life, brought into court on a charge of libel.\r\nThe veteran libeller, then seventy years of age, defended himself in a\r\nspeech which occupied six hours. The jury did not agree,--six being for\r\nconviction and six for acquittal.\r\n\r\nAt the general election for the Reform Parliament in 1832, Cobbett was\r\nchosen member for the borough of Oldham, which seat he held until June\r\n18, 1835, when his long, active, and disturbed career was closed by\r\ndeath, leaving her whom he had loved at the wash-tub, amid the snows of\r\nNew Brunswick, his honored widow.\r\n\r\nHis character was unique. He was the most emphatic of writers, perhaps\r\nthe most voluminous. He was foremost in the crew of haters; he was the\r\nparagon of turncoats. Sentiments uttered at one period were denied at\r\nanother. At one time he wrote of Paine as follows: \"He has done all the\r\nmischief he can in the world, and whether his carcass is at last to\r\nbe suffered to rot on the earth or to be dried in the air is of very\r\nlittle consequence. Whenever or wherever he breathes his last, he will\r\nexcite neither sorrow nor compassion; no friendly hand will close his\r\neyes.\"[129] Later in life, on his second visit to America, he exhumed\r\nthe bones of the man he had thus reviled, and bore them in idolatrous\r\ncustody to the land of his birth.\r\n\r\n    [129] Life of Thomas Paine: Political Censor, No. V., Sept., 1796:\r\nPorcupine's Works, Vol. IV. pp. 112, 113.\r\n\r\nBesides his multitudinous political writings, which in number remind\r\nus of the cloud of \"locusts warping on the eastern wind,\" he produced\r\nseveral works of great and deserved popularity,--a Grammar of the\r\nFrench Language, written while he rocked the cradle of his first\r\nchild,--a Grammar of the English Language,--a little volume, \"Advice to\r\nYoung Men,\"--and a series of sketches entitled \"Rural Rides,\" in which\r\nhe gave unmixed pleasure to friend and foe.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt thus long upon the life and character of Cobbett, as\r\na proper introduction to the picture of his marvellous industry,\r\nwhich I am able to present in his own language. The labor which he\r\naccomplished testifies; but in his writings he often refers to it with\r\npeculiar pride. He tells us how he learned grammar. Writing a fair\r\nhand, he was employed as copyist by the commandant of the garrison\r\nwhere he first enlisted. In his autobiography he says: \"Being totally\r\nignorant of the rules of grammar, I necessarily made many mistakes.\r\nThe Colonel saw my deficiency, and strongly recommended study. I\r\nprocured me a Lowth's Grammar, and applied myself to the study of it\r\nwith unceasing assiduity. The pains I took cannot be described. I\r\nwrote the whole Grammar out two or three times; I got it by heart;\r\nI repeated it every morning and every evening; and when on guard, I\r\nimposed on myself the task of saying it all over once, every time I was\r\nposted sentinel.\"[130] Would that all posted as sentinels were as well\r\nemployed as saying over to themselves the English grammar! If every\r\ncommon soldier could do this, there would be little fear of war. The\r\nevil spirits were supposed to be driven away by an Ave Maria or a word\r\nof prayer. The grammar would be as potent. \"Terrible as an army with\r\ngrammars\" would be more than \"Terrible as an army with banners.\"\r\n\r\n    [130] Life, p. 38.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Advice to Young Men\" Cobbett says: \"For my part, I can truly\r\nsay that I owe more of my great labors to my strict adherence to the\r\nprecepts that I have here given you than to all the natural abilities\r\nwith which I have been endowed; for these, whatever may have been their\r\namount, would have been of comparatively little use, even aided by\r\ngreat sobriety and abstinence, if I had not in early life contracted\r\nthe blessed habit of husbanding well my time. To this, more than to any\r\nother thing, I owed my very extraordinary promotion in the army. I was\r\n_always ready_. If I had to mount guard at ten, I was ready at nine;\r\nnever did any man or any thing wait one moment for me.... My custom was\r\nthis: to get up in summer at daylight, and in winter at four o'clock;\r\nshave, dress, even to the putting of my sword-belt over my shoulder,\r\nand having my sword lying on the table before me, ready to hang by my\r\nside. Then I ate a bit of cheese or pork and bread. Then I prepared my\r\nreport, which was filled up as fast as the companies brought me in the\r\nmaterials. After this I had an hour or two to read before the time came\r\nfor any duty out of doors.\"[131]\r\n\r\n    [131] Advice to Young Men, pp. 35, 36.\r\n\r\nAt a later period of life, when his condition was entirely changed,\r\nand his name as a writer was in all men's mouths, he thus describes\r\nhis habits. \"I hardly ever eat more than twice a day,--when at home,\r\nnever,--and I never, if I can well avoid it, eat any meat later than\r\none or two o'clock in the day. I drink a little tea or milk-and-water\r\nat the usual tea-time (about seven o'clock). I go to bed at eight, if I\r\ncan. I write or read from about four to about eight, and then, hungry\r\nas a hunter, I go to breakfast.\"[132]\r\n\r\n    [132] Life, p. 137.\r\n\r\nIn another place he recounts with especial satisfaction a conversation\r\nat which he was present, one of the parties to which was Sir John\r\nSinclair, the famous agriculturist and correspondent of Washington. \"I\r\nonce heard Sir John Sinclair,\" he says, \"ask Mr. Cochrane Johnstone\r\nwhether he meant to have a son of his, then a little boy, taught Latin.\r\n'No,' said Mr. Johnstone, 'but I mean to do something a great deal\r\nbetter for him.' 'What is that?' said Sir John. 'Why,' said the other,\r\n'teach him to shave with cold water and without a glass.'\"[133]\r\n\r\n    [133] Advice to Young Men, p. 34.\r\n\r\nWith this pertinacious devotion to labor, and this unparalleled sense\r\nof the value of time, Cobbett surrendered himself to the blandishments\r\nof domestic life. The hundred-armed giant of the press, he always had\r\nan arm for his child. \"For my own part,\" he says, \"how many days, how\r\nmany months, all put together, have I spent with babies in my arms! My\r\ntime, when at home, and when babies were going on, was chiefly divided\r\nbetween the pen and the baby. I have fed them and put them to sleep\r\nhundreds of times, though there were servants to whom the task might\r\nhave been transferred. Yet I have not been effeminate; I have not been\r\nidle; I have not been a waster of time.\" \"Many a score of papers have I\r\nwritten amidst the noise of children, and in my whole life never bade\r\nthem be still. When they grew up to be big enough to gallop about the\r\nhouse, I have, in wet weather, when they could not go out, written the\r\nwhole day amidst noise that would have made some authors half mad. It\r\nnever annoyed me at all.\"[134]\r\n\r\n    [134] Advice to Young Men, pp. 142, 194.\r\n\r\nThese passages are like windows in his life, through which we discern\r\nhis character, where the domestic affections seem to vie with the sense\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nNo person can become familiar with the career of Cobbett without\r\nrecognizing regular habits of industry as the potent means of producing\r\nimportant results. Did the hour permit, it would be pleasant and\r\ninstructive to review the career of another distinguished character,\r\nwhose writings have added much to the happiness of his age, and whose\r\nrare feats of labor illustrate the same truth: I mean the author of\r\n\"Waverley.\" There are points of comparison or contrast between Cobbett\r\nand Scott which might be presented at length. They were strictly\r\ncontemporaries, spanning with their lives almost the same long tract\r\nof time. They were the most voluminous authors of their age, perhaps\r\nthe most voluminous couple of any age. Since the days of Ariosto\r\nno writers had been read by so many persons as was the fortune of\r\neach. The marvellous fecundity of Scott was more than matched by the\r\nprolific energy of Cobbett. The fame of the Scotsman was equalled by\r\nthe notoriety of the Englishman. If one awakened our delight, we could\r\nnot withhold from the other our astonishment. With Scott life was a\r\ngala and a festival, with beauty, wit, and bravery. With Cobbett it was\r\na stern reality, perpetually crying out, like the witch in Macbeth,\r\n\"I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.\" And yet Scott was hardly less careful\r\nof time than his indefatigable contemporary. His life is a lesson of\r\nindustry, and the student may derive instruction from his example.\r\nBoth sought in early rising the propitious hours of labor; but the\r\nmorning brought its rich incense to the one, and its vigor to the\r\nother. They departed this life within a short period of each other,\r\ncasting and leaving behind their voluminous folds of authorship. The\r\nfuture historian will note and study these; but the world, which has\r\nalready dismissed Cobbett from its presence, will hardly cherish with\r\nenduring affection the writings of Scott. He lived in the Past, and,\r\nwith ill-directed genius, sought to gild the force, the injustice, the\r\ninhumanity of the early ages. Cobbett lived intensely in the Present,\r\nand drew his inspiration from its short-lived controversies. For\r\nneither had Hope scattered from her \"pictured urn\" the delights of an\r\nunborn period, when the dignity of Humanity shall stand confessed.\r\nA greater fame than is awarded to either will be his who hereafter,\r\nwith the imagination of the one and the energy of the other, without\r\nthe spirit of Hate that animated Cobbett, without the spirit of Caste\r\nthat prevailed in Scott, regarding life neither as a festival nor as\r\na battle, forgetting Cavalier and Roundhead alike, and remembering\r\nonly Universal Man, shall dedicate the labors of a long life, not to\r\nthe Past, not to the Present only, but also to the Future, striving to\r\nbring its blessings nearer to all.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the examples by which we learn the constant lesson of\r\nthe value of time. For them genius did much, but industry went hand in\r\nhand with this celestial guide.\r\n\r\nHere the student may ask by what rule time is to be arranged and\r\napportioned so as to accomplish the greatest results. If we interrogate\r\nthe lives of our masters in this regard, we shall find no uniform rule\r\nas to the employment of the day, or even the hours of repose. The great\r\nlawyer, Lord Coke, whose rare learning and professional fame cannot\r\nrender us insensible to his brutality of character, has preserved for\r\nthe benefit of the young student some Latin verses setting forth the\r\nproper division of the day, allowing six hours for sleep, six for\r\nthe law, four for prayers, two for meals, while all the rest, being\r\nsix hours more, is to be lavished on the sacred muses.[135] These\r\ndirections are imperfectly reproduced in two English rhymes:--\r\n\r\n    Six hours in sleep; in law's grave study six;\r\n    Four spend in prayer; the rest on Nature fix.\"\r\n\r\n    [135]\r\n\r\n\"Sex horas somno, totidem des legibus æquis, Quatuor orabis, des\r\nepulisque duas; Quod superest ultro sacris largire camoenis.\"\r\n\r\nCO. LITT. 64.\r\n\r\nA more estimable character than Lord Coke, in whose life clustered\r\nliterary as well as professional honors, Sir William Jones, himself a\r\nmodel of the industry he inculcated, has said in a well-known distich:--\r\n\r\n    \"Six hours to law, to soothing slumber seven,\r\n     Ten to the world allot, and all to Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe one hour here unappropriated is absorbed in the \"all to Heaven.\"\r\nSir Matthew Hale, another eminent name in jurisprudence, studied\r\nsixteen hours a day for the first two years after he commenced the law,\r\nbut almost brought himself to the grave thereby, though of a strong\r\nconstitution, and he afterwards came down to eight hours; but he would\r\nnot advise anybody to so much,--believing that six hours a day, with\r\nconstancy and attention, were sufficient, and adding, that \"a man must\r\nuse his body as he would his horse and his stomach, not tire him at\r\nonce, but rise with an appetite.\"[136] Here is at once example and\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\n    [136] Roscoe, Lives of Eminent British Lawyers: Notes, pp. 413, 414.\r\n\r\nSleep is the most exacting of masters; it must be obeyed. Couriers\r\nslumber on their horses; soldiers drop asleep on the field of battle,\r\neven amidst the din of war. In that famous retreat of Sir John Moore,\r\nEnglish soldiers are said to have slept while still moving. Ambition\r\nand the pride of victory yield to sleep. Alexander slept on the field\r\nof Arbela, and Napoleon on the field of Austerlitz. Bereavement and\r\napproaching death are forgotten in sleep. The convict sleeps in the\r\nfew hours before his execution. According to Homer, sleep overcomes\r\neven the gods, excepting Jupiter alone. Its beneficence is equal to its\r\npower; nor has this ever been pictured more wonderfully than in those\r\nagonized words of Macbeth, where he says,--\r\n\r\n    \"Macbeth does murther sleep, the innocent sleep,--\r\n     Sleep, that knits up the ravelled sleave of care,\r\n     The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,\r\n     Balm of hurt minds, great Nature's second course,\r\n     Chief nourisher in life's feast.\"\r\n\r\nThe rule of sleep is not the same for all. There are some with whom its\r\nrequirements are gentle: a few hours will suffice. But such cases are\r\nexceptional. The Jesuits have done much for education, but on this\r\nquestion they seem to have failed. In settling the system for their\r\ncollege at Clermont, they followed their physicians in a rigid rule.\r\nThe latter reported that five hours were sufficient, six abundant, and\r\nseven as much as a youthful constitution could bear without injury. On\r\nthe other hand, Cobbett, whose experience of life was as thorough as\r\nhis diligence, says expressly: \"Young people require more sleep than\r\nthose that are grown up: there must be the number of hours, and that\r\nnumber cannot well be on an average less than eight; and if it be more\r\nin winter-time, it is all the better.\"[137] George the Third thought\r\notherwise, at least for men. A tradesman, whom he had asked to call on\r\nhim at eight o'clock in the morning, arriving behind the hour, the King\r\nsaid, \"Oh! the great Mr. B.! What sleep do you take, Mr. B.?\" \"Why,\r\nplease your Majesty, I am a man of regular habits; I usually take eight\r\nhours.\" \"Eight hours!\" said the King; \"that's too much, too much. Six\r\nhours' sleep is enough for a man, seven for a woman, and eight for a\r\nfool,--Mr. B., eight for a fool.\" The opinions of physiologists would\r\nprobably incline with Mr. B., the tradesman, contrary to this royal\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n    [137] Advice to Young Men, p. 33.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to lay down any universal rule with regard to the\r\nproper portion of time for sleep. Each constitution of body has its\r\nown habits; nor can any rule be drawn from the lives of the most\r\nindustrious, except of economy of time, according to the capacity\r\nof each person. The great German scholar Heyne, who has shed such\r\nlustre on classical learning, in the order of his early studies\r\nallowed himself, for six months, only two nights' sleep in a week. The\r\neccentric Robert Hill, of England, who passed his life as a tailor,\r\nbut by persevering labor made rare attainments in Latin, Greek, and\r\nHebrew, was accustomed to sit up very late into the night, or else\r\nto rise by two or three o'clock in the morning, that he might find\r\ntime for reading without prejudice to his trade, and although of a\r\nweakly constitution, he accustomed himself to do very well with only\r\ntwo or three hours of sleep in the twenty-four, and he lived to be\r\nseventy-eight. But this is a curiosity rather than an example. Such\r\nalso is the story of the Roman Emperor Caligula, who slept only three\r\nhours. In the list of men sleeping only four hours is Frederick\r\nof Prussia, John Hunter, the surgeon, Napoleon, and Alexander von\r\nHumboldt. That gallant cavalier and accomplished historian, renowned\r\nfor genius and misfortune, Sir Walter Raleigh, was accustomed, even\r\nunder the pressure of his arduous career, to devote four hours daily\r\nto reading and study, while he allowed only five for sleep. Probably\r\nall of us, in our own personal experience, have known men of study and\r\nlabor who, in the ardor of their pursuit, have foregone what is thought\r\nthe ordinary sleep, being late to bed and early to rise, reducing the\r\nnight to a narrow isthmus of time. Others there are with a vivacity\r\nof industry which acts with intensity and rapidity, requiring long\r\nperiods of repose. I cannot forget that Judge Story, the person who\r\nhas accomplished more than any one within the circle of my individual\r\nobservation, whose life--now, alas! closed by death--was thickly\r\nstudded with various labors as judge, professor, and author, is a high\r\nexample of what may be wrought by wakeful diligence, without denying\r\nthe body any refreshment of repose. His habit, during the years of his\r\ngreatest intellectual activity, was to retire always at ten o'clock\r\nand to rise at seven,--allowing nine hours for sleep. The tradesman\r\nof George the Third might have sought shelter with him from the royal\r\nraillery.\r\n\r\nPursuing these inquiries as to the arrangement of the day, we find the\r\nprecept, if not the example, uniform with regard to early rising as\r\npropitious to health and intellectual exertion. The old saw, \"Early to\r\nbed and early to rise,\" imprints the lesson upon the mind of childhood.\r\nThe magnificent period of Milton sounds in our ears: \"My morning haunts\r\nare where they should be, at home,--not sleeping, or concocting the\r\nsurfeits of an irregular feast, but up and stirring,--in winter often\r\nere the sound of any bell awake men to labor or to devotion,--in summer\r\nas oft with the bird that first rouses, or not much tardier, to read\r\ngood authors or cause them to be read, till the attention be weary or\r\nmemory have its full fraught,--then with useful and generous labors\r\npreserving the body's health and hardiness, to render lightsome, clear,\r\nand not lumpish obedience to the mind, to the cause of religion, and\r\nour country's liberty.\"[138] Sir Walter Scott is less stately in his\r\ntribute to the morning, but he agrees with Milton: \"The half-hour\r\nbetween waking and rising has all my life proved propitious to any\r\ntask which was exercising my invention. When I got over any knotty\r\ndifficulty in a story, or have had in former times to fill up a passage\r\nin a poem, it was always when I first opened my eyes that the desired\r\nideas thronged upon me. This is so much the case, that I am in the\r\nhabit of relying upon it, and saying to myself, when I am at a loss,\r\n'Never mind, we shall have it at seven o'clock to-morrow morning.' If I\r\nhave forgot a circumstance, or a name, or a copy of verses, it is the\r\nsame thing.\"[139] In this equal dedication to the morning Milton and\r\nScott are alike, but how unlike in all else! Milton's testimony is like\r\nan anthem; Scott's like an affidavit.\r\n\r\n    [138] Apology for Smectymnuus: Prose Works, Vol. I. p. 220.\r\n\r\n    [139] Diary: Lockhart's Life of Scott, Chap. VII. Vol. VI. p. 227.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these great examples and the prevailing precept, it\r\nmay be doubted if the student can be weaned from those habits which\r\nlead him to continue his vigils far into the watches of the night. From\r\ntime immemorial he has been said to \"consume the midnight oil,\" and\r\nproductions marked by peculiar care are proverbially reputed to \"smell\r\nof the lamp,\" never to breathe the odor of the morning. An ingenious\r\ninquirer might be inclined to trace in different writers, particularly\r\nin poets, the distinctive influence of the hours they devoted to\r\nlabor, and, perhaps, to find in Milton and Scott the freshness and\r\nvivid colors of the rosy-fingered dawn, and in Schiller and Byron the\r\nsombre shade and sickly glare of the lamp. Whatever the result of\r\nsuch speculations, which might be moralized by example, the midnight\r\nlamp will ever be regarded as the symbol of labor. In the wonders it\r\nhas wrought it yields only to the far-famed lamp of Aladdin. They who\r\nconfess themselves among \"the slaves of the lamp\" say that there is\r\nan excitement in study, increasing as the work proceeds, which flames\r\nforth with new brightness at the close of the day and in the stillness\r\nof those hours when the world is wrapped in sleep and the student is\r\nthe sole watcher. The heavy clock seems to toll the midnight hour\r\nin the church-belfry for him alone, and, as he catches its distant\r\nvibrations, he thinks that he hears the iron hoof of Time come sounding\r\nby. All interruptions are ended, and he is in closer companionship\r\nwith his books and studies. He holds converse face to face with the\r\nspirits of the mighty dead, while the learned page and glowing verse\r\nbecome vocal with inspiring thought. The poet speaks to him with richer\r\nmelodies, and the soul responds in new and more generous resolves.\r\n\r\nIt is not for me on this occasion to interpose any judgment on a\r\nquestion which comes within the precincts of physiology. My present\r\npurpose is accomplished, if I teach the husbandry of time. To this\r\nend I have adduced authority and example. But there are other\r\nconsiderations which enforce the lesson with persuasive power.\r\n\r\nIn the employment of time will be found the sure means of happiness.\r\nThe laborer living by the sweat of his brow, and the youth toiling\r\nin perplexities of business or study, sighs for repose, and repines\r\nat the law which ordains the seeming hardship of his lot. He seeks\r\nhappiness as the end and aim of life, but he does not open his mind to\r\nthe important truth that occupation is indispensable to happiness. He\r\nshuns work, but he does not know the precious jewel hidden beneath its\r\nrude attire. Others there are who wander over half the globe in pursuit\r\nof what is found under the humblest roof of virtuous industry, in the\r\nshadow of every tree planted by one's own hand. The poet has said,--\r\n\r\n    \"The best and sweetest far are toil-created gains.\"\r\n\r\nBut this does not disclose the whole truth. There is in useful labor\r\nits own exceeding great reward, without regard to gain.\r\n\r\nThe happiness found in occupation is the frequent theme of the\r\nmoralist, but nobody has illustrated it with more power than Luther\r\nin his Table-Talk, where he presents an image of the human mind which\r\nhas always seemed to me one of the most striking in the whole range of\r\nliterature. Let me give it in the strong and fibrous diction of the\r\nancient translation from the original Latin.\r\n\r\n\"The heart of an humane creature is like a mill-stone in a mill: when\r\ncorn is shaked thereupon, it runneth about, rubbeth and grindeth it to\r\nmeal; but if no corn bee present (the stone nevertheless running still\r\nabout), then it rubbeth and grindeth it self thinner, and becometh less\r\nand smaller: even so the heart of an humane creature will bee occupied;\r\nif it hath not the works of its vocation in hand to bee busied therein,\r\nthen cometh the Divel and shooteth thereinto tribulations, heavie\r\ncogitations and vexations, as then the heart consumeth it self with\r\nmelancholie, insomuch that it must starv and famish.\"[140] That it may\r\nnot starve and famish, it must be supplied with something to do; and\r\nits happiness will be in proportion to the completeness with which all\r\nits faculties are brought into activity.\r\n\r\n    [140] Dr. Martin Luther's Divine Discourses at his Table, etc.,\r\ntranslated out of the High Germane into the English Tongue by Capt.\r\nHenrie Bell, London, 1652: Chap. XXXVII., _Of Tribulation and\r\nTemptation_, p. 397.\r\n\r\nIt is according to God's Providence that there should be pleasure in\r\nthe exercise of all the powers with which we are blessed. There is\r\npleasure in seeing the sights and catching the sounds of Nature. There\r\nis pleasure in the exercise of the limbs, even in extending an arm\r\nor moving a muscle. Higher degrees of pleasure are allotted to the\r\nexercise of the higher faculties. There is pleasure in the acquisition\r\nof knowledge,--pleasure in the performance of duty,--pleasure in all\r\nthe labors by which we promote our own progress,--pleasure higher still\r\nin those by which we promote the progress of others.\r\n\r\nIf this be so,--and surely it will not be doubted,--then is it our\r\nduty to regulate our habits so as to cultivate all the faculties, to\r\nthe end that Time shall yield its choicest fruits. When I speak of\r\nall the faculties, I mean all those which enter into and form the\r\ncharacter created in the image of God, not merely those which minister\r\nto the selfish ends of life. There are faculties for business; there\r\nare others which open to us the avenues of knowledge,--others which\r\nconnect us by chains soft as silk, but strong as iron, to the social\r\nand domestic circle,--others still which reveal to us, in vistas of\r\ninfinite variety and inconceivable extension, our duties to God and\r\nman. Nor can any one reasonably persuade himself that he has done\r\nhis whole duty, and employed his time to the best purpose, who has\r\nneglected any of these, although he may have sacrificed much to the\r\nothers. Success in business will not compensate for neglect of general\r\nculture; nor will attendance on \"the stated preaching of the gospel\"\r\natone for a want of interest in the great charities of life, in the\r\neducation of the people, in the sufferings of the poor, in the sorrows\r\nof the slave.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency to absorption by one pursuit or one idea, against\r\nwhich we must especially guard. The mere man of business is \"a man of\r\none idea,\"[141] and his solitary idea has its root in no generous\r\nor humane desires, but in selfishness. He lives for himself alone.\r\nHe may send his freights to the most distant quarters of the earth,\r\nand receive therefrom returning argosies, but his real horizon is\r\nrestricted to the narrow circle of his own personal interests; nor does\r\nhis worldly nature, elated by the profits of cent per cent, see with\r\neye of sympathy, in cotton sold or sugar bought, the drops of blood\r\nfalling from the unhappy slaves out of whose labor they were wrung. In\r\nthe mere man of business the individual is lost in the profession or\r\ncalling, thinking only of that, and caring little for other things of\r\nlife. He is known by the character that business impresses upon him.\r\nHe is untiring in its pursuit, but with no true progress, for each day\r\nrenews its predecessor. Benevolence calls, but he is deaf, or satisfies\r\nhis conscience by a dole of money. Literature exhibits her charms, but\r\nhe is insensible. And innocent recreation makes her pleasant appeal,\r\nbut he will not listen. He is absorbed, engrossed, filled in every\r\nvein by the \"one idea\" of business with new methods of adding to his\r\nincreasing gains, as the mouth of the money-seeking Crassus was filled\r\nby the Parthians with molten gold.\r\n\r\n    [141] At the date of this Lecture the Abolitionist was constantly\r\ntaunted, especially by business men, as \"the man of one idea.\"\r\n\r\nWe learn to deride the pedant who sacrifices everything to the\r\naccumulation of empty learning, which he displays at all times, as a\r\npeddler his wares. The image of Dominie Sampson, in Scott's novel of\r\n\"Guy Mannering,\" is a happy scarecrow to frighten us from his \"one\r\nidea.\" But the merchant whose only talk is of markets, the farmer\r\nwhose only talk is of bullocks, and the lawyer whose only talk is\r\nof his cases, are all Dominie Sampsons in their way. They have all\r\nmissed that completeness and harmony of development essential to the\r\nbalance of the faculties and to the best usefulness. They have become\r\nricher in this world's goods; but they have sacrificed what money\r\ncannot supply,--a general intelligence, an independence of calling or\r\nposition, and a catholic, liberal spirit. In the prejudices engendered\r\nby exclusive devotion to a single pursuit, they have lost one of the\r\nmost important attributes of man,--the power to receive and appreciate\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nIt is a common saying, handed down with reverence in my own profession,\r\nwhere it is attested at once by Bacon and by Coke, that \"every man\r\nowes a debt to his profession.\" If by this is meant that every man\r\nshould seek to elevate his profession, and to increase its usefulness,\r\nthe saying is a truism, although valuable as at least one remove\r\nfrom individual selfishness. But is it not too often construed so as\r\nto exclude exertion in any other walk, or to serve as a cloak for\r\nindifference to other things? Important as this debt may be,--and\r\nI will not disparage it,--not for this alone are we sent into the\r\nworld. There are other debts which must not be postponed. Man was\r\nnot thus fearfully and wonderfully made,--the cunningest pattern of\r\nexcelling Nature,--endowed with infinite faculties,--traversing with\r\nthe angels the blue floor of Heaven,--ranging with light from system\r\nto system of the Universe,--descending to the earth and receiving\r\nin bountiful largess all its hoarded treasures,--girdling the globe\r\nwith the peaceful embrace of commerce,--imposing chains even upon the\r\nlawless sea,--making the winds and elements do his bidding,--summoning\r\nto his company all that is and all that has been the good and great\r\nof all times, exemplars of truth, liberty, and virtue, all the grand\r\nprocession of history,--formed to throb at every deed of generosity\r\nand self-sacrifice, and to send forth his sympathies wider and sweeter\r\nthan any south-wind blowing over beds of violets, until they reach the\r\nmost distant sufferer,--formed for the acquisition of knowledge and of\r\nscience,--gifted to enjoy the various feast of letters and art, the\r\nbreathing canvas and marble, the infinite many-choired voices of all\r\nthe sons of genius who have written or spoken, the beauty of mountain,\r\nfield, and river, the dazzling drapery of the winter snow, the glory\r\nof sunset, the blushing of the rose,--man was not made with all these\r\ncapacities, looking before and after, spanning the vast outstretched\r\nPast, penetrating the vaster unfathomable Future, with all its images\r\nof beauty, merely to follow a profession or a trade, merely to be a\r\nmerchant, a lawyer, a mechanic, a soldier.\r\n\r\n\"So God created man in his own image; in the image of God created he\r\nhim.\" The image of God is in the soul, and the young must take heed\r\nthat it is not effaced by the neglect of any of the trusts they have\r\nreceived. They must bear in mind that there are debts other than to\r\ntheir profession or business, which, like gratitude, it will ever be\r\ntheir pleasure, \"still paying, still to owe,\"--which can be properly\r\ndischarged only by the best employment of all the faculties with which\r\nthey are blessed,--so that life shall be improved by culture and filled\r\nwith works for the good of man.\r\n\r\nIn no respect would I weaken any just attachment to the business of\r\none's choice. Goethe advised every one to read daily a short poem;\r\nand in the same spirit would I refine and elevate business by the\r\nchastening influence of other pursuits, by enlarging the intelligence,\r\nby widening the sphere of observation and interest, by awakening new\r\nsympathies.\r\n\r\nIn the faithful husbandry of time, in the aggregation of all its\r\nparticles of golden sand, is the first stage of individual progress.\r\nWith the living spirit of industry, the student will find his way easy.\r\nDifficulties cannot permanently obstruct his resolute career. He will\r\nremember \"rare Ben Jonson,\" one of England's admired and most learned\r\nbards, working as a bricklayer with a trowel in his hand and a book in\r\nhis pocket,--Burns, wooing his muse as he followed the plough on the\r\nmountain-side,--the beloved German Jean Paul, composing his earliest\r\nworks by the music of the simmering kettles in his mother's humble\r\nkitchen,--and Franklin, while a printer's boy, straitened by small\r\nmeans, beginning those studies and labors which make him an example to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nSeek, then, occupation; seek labor; seek to employ all the faculties,\r\nwhether in study or conduct,--not in words only, but in deeds also,\r\nmindful that \"words are the daughters of Earth, but deeds are the\r\nsons of Heaven.\" So shall you eat of that fabled fruit growing on the\r\nbanks of the river of Delight, whereby men gain a blessed course of\r\nlife without one moment of sadness. So shall your days be filled with\r\nusefulness,--\r\n\r\n    \"And when old Time shall lead you to your end,\r\n     Goodness and you fill up one monument.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a legend of Friar Roger Bacon, so conspicuous in what may be\r\ncalled the mythology of modern science, which enforces the importance\r\nof seizing the present moment; nor could I hope to close this appeal\r\nwith anything better calculated to impress upon all the lesson I have\r\nsought to teach. With wizard skill he had succeeded in constructing a\r\nbrazen head, which, by unimaginable contrivance, after unknown lapse\r\nof time, was to speak and declare important knowledge. Weary with\r\nwatching for the auspicious moment, which had been prolonged through\r\nsuccessive weeks, he had sought the refreshment of sleep, leaving\r\nhis man Miles to observe the head, and to awaken him at once, if it\r\nshould speak, that he might not fail to interrogate it. Shortly after\r\nhe had sunk to rest, the head spake these words, _Time is_. But the\r\nfoolish guardian heeded them not, nor the commands of his master, whom\r\nhe allowed to slumber unconscious of the auspicious moment. Another\r\nhalf-hour passed and the head spake the words, _Time was_, which\r\nMiles still heeded not. Another half-hour passed, and the head spake\r\nyet other words, _Time is past_, and straightway fell to the earth,\r\nshivered in pieces, with a terrible crash and strange flashes of fire,\r\nso that Miles was half dead with fear; and his master awoke to behold\r\nthe workmanship of his cunning hand and the hopes he had builded\r\nthereupon shattered, while the voice from the brazen throat still\r\nsounded in his ears, TIME IS PAST!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THE LATE JOHN PICKERING.\r\n\r\n              ARTICLE IN THE LAW REPORTER OF JUNE, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a remark of Lord Brougham, illustrated by his own crowded life,\r\nthat the complete performance of all the duties of an active member\r\nof the British Parliament might be joined to a full practice at the\r\nbar. The career of the late Mr. Pickering illustrates a more grateful\r\ntruth: that the mastery of the law as a science and the constant\r\nperformance of all the duties of a practitioner are not incompatible\r\nwith the studies of the most various scholarship,--that the lawyer\r\nand the scholar may be _one_. He dignified the law by the successful\r\ncultivation of letters, and strengthened the influence of these elegant\r\npursuits by becoming their representative in the concerns of daily life\r\nand in the labors of his profession. And now that this living example\r\nof excellence is withdrawn, we feel a sorrow which words can only\r\nfaintly express. We would devote a few moments to the contemplation of\r\nwhat he did and what he was. The language of exaggeration is forbidden\r\nby the modesty of his nature, as it is rendered unnecessary by the\r\nmultitude of his virtues.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN PICKERING, whose recent death we deplore, was born in Salem,\r\nFebruary 7, 1777, at the darkest and most despondent period of the\r\nRevolution. His father, Colonel Pickering, was a man of distinguished\r\ncharacter and an eminent actor in public affairs, whose name belongs to\r\nthe history of our country. Of his large family of ten children John\r\nwas the eldest.[142] His diligence at school was a source of early\r\ngratification to his family, and gave augury of future accomplishments.\r\nAn authentic token of this character, beyond any tradition of partial\r\nfriends, is afforded by a little book entitled \"Letters to a Student in\r\nthe University of Cambridge, Massachusetts, by John Clarke, Minister\r\nof a Church in Boston,\" printed in 1796, and in reality addressed to\r\nhim. The first letter begins with an honorable allusion to his early\r\nimprovement. \"Your superior qualifications for admission into the\r\nUniversity give you singular advantages for the prosecution of your\r\nstudies.... You are now placed in a situation to become, what you have\r\noften assured me is your ambition, _a youth of learning and virtue_.\"\r\nThe last letter of the volume concludes with benedictions, which did\r\nnot fall as barren words upon the heart of the youthful pupil. \"May\r\nyou,\" says Dr. Clarke, \"be one of those sons who do honor to their\r\nliterary parent. The union of _virtue_ and _science_ will give you\r\ndistinction at the present age, and will tend to give celebrity to the\r\nname of Harvard. You will not disappoint the friends who anticipate\r\nyour improvements.\" They who remember his college days still dwell with\r\nfondness upon his exemplary character and his remarkable scholarship.\r\nHe received his degree of Bachelor of Arts at Cambridge in 1796.\r\n\r\n    [142] The reporter, Octavius Pickering, was so named from his being the\r\n_eighth_ child.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the University he went to Philadelphia, at that time the\r\nseat of government, his father being Secretary of State. Here he\r\ncommenced the study of the law under Mr. Tilghman, afterwards the\r\ndistinguished Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, and one of the lights of\r\nAmerican jurisprudence. But his professional lucubrations were soon\r\nsuspended by his appointment, in 1797, as Secretary of Legation to\r\nPortugal. In this capacity he resided at Lisbon for two years, during\r\nwhich time he became familiar with the language and literature of the\r\ncountry. Later in life, when his extensive knowledge of foreign tongues\r\nopened to him the literature of the world, he recurred with peculiar\r\npleasure to the language of Camoens and Pombal.\r\n\r\nFrom Lisbon he passed to London, where, at the close of the last\r\ncentury, he became, for about two years, the private secretary of our\r\nMinister, Mr. King, residing in the family and enjoying the society and\r\nfriendship of this distinguished representative of his country. Here he\r\nwas happy in meeting with his classmate and attached friend, Dr. James\r\nJackson, of Boston, then in London, pursuing those medical studies\r\nwhose ripened autumnal fruits of usefulness and eminence he still lives\r\nto enjoy. In pleasant companionship they perambulated the thoroughfares\r\nof the great metropolis, enjoying together its shows and attractions;\r\nin pleasant companionship they continued ever afterwards, till death\r\nsevered the ties of long life.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickering's youth and inexperience in the profession to which he\r\nafterwards devoted his days prevented his taking any special interest,\r\nat this period, in the courts or in Parliament. But there were several\r\nof the judges who made a strong impression on his mind; nor did he\r\never cease to remember the vivacious eloquence of Erskine or the\r\ncommanding oratory of Pitt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, his father, being no longer in the public service, had\r\nreturned to Salem; and thither the son followed, in 1801, resuming\r\nthe study of the law, under the direction of Mr. Putnam, afterwards a\r\nlearned and beloved Judge of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, whose\r\nrare fortune it has been to rear two pupils whose fame will be among\r\nthe choicest possessions of our country,--Story and Pickering. In due\r\ntime he was admitted to the bar, and commenced the practice of the law\r\nin Salem.\r\n\r\nHere begins the long, unbroken series of his labors in literature and\r\nphilology, running side by side with the daily, untiring business\r\nof his profession. It is easy to believe, that, notwithstanding his\r\nundissembled predilection for jurisprudence as a _science_, he was\r\ndrawn towards its _practice_ by the compulsion of duty rather than by\r\nany attraction it possessed for him. Not removed by fortune from the\r\nnecessity, to which Dr. Johnson so pathetically alludes, of providing\r\nfor the day that was passing over him, he could indulge his taste\r\nfor study only in hours secured by diligence from the inroads of\r\nbusiness or refused to the seductions of pleasure. Since the oration\r\nfor Archias, perhaps no lawyer ever lived who could have uttered with\r\ngreater truth the inspiring words with which, in that remarkable\r\nproduction, the Roman orator confessed and vindicated the cultivation\r\nof letters: \"Me autem quid pudeat, qui tot annos ita vivo, judices, ut\r\nab nullius unquam me tempore aut commodo aut otium meum abstraxerit,\r\naut voluptas avocârit, aut denique somnus retardârit? Quare quis tandem\r\nme reprehendat, aut quis mihi jure succenseat, si, quantum cæteris ad\r\nsuas res obeundas, quantum ad festos dies ludorum celebrandos, quantum\r\nad alias voluptates, et ad ipsam requiem animi et corporis conceditur\r\ntemporum, quantum alii tribuunt tempestivis conviviis, quantum denique\r\naleæ, quantum pilæ, tantum mihi egomet ad hæc studia recolenda\r\nsumpsero?\"[143]\r\n\r\n    [143] Pro Archia, c. 6.\r\n\r\nIn his life may be seen two streams flowing side by side, as through a\r\nlong tract of country: one fed by the fresh fountains high up in the\r\nmountain-tops, whose waters leap with delight on their journey to the\r\nsea; while the other, having its sources low down in the valleys, among\r\nthe haunts of men, moves with reluctant, though steady, current onward.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering's days were passed in the performance of all the duties\r\nof a wide and various practice, first at Salem, and afterwards at\r\nBoston. He resided at the former place till 1827, when he removed to\r\nthe metropolis, where two years afterwards he became City Solicitor,\r\nan office whose arduous labors he continued to discharge until within\r\na few months of his death. There is little worthy of notice in the\r\nordinary incidents of professional life. What Blackstone aptly calls\r\n\"the pert dispute\" renews itself in infinitely varying form. Some\r\nnew turn of litigation calls forth some new effort of learning or\r\nskill, calculated to serve its temporary purpose, and, like the manna\r\nwhich fell in the desert, perishing on the day that beholds it. The\r\nunambitious labors of which the world knows nothing, the advice to\r\nclients, the drawing of contracts, the perplexities of conveyancing\r\nfurnish still less of interest than ephemeral displays of the\r\ncourt-room.\r\n\r\nThe cares of his profession and the cultivation of letters left\r\nbut little time for the concerns of politics. And yet, at different\r\nperiods, he filled offices in the Legislature of Massachusetts. He was\r\nthree times Representative from Salem, twice Senator from Essex, once\r\nSenator from Suffolk, and once a member of the Executive Council. In\r\nall these places he commended himself by the same diligence, honesty,\r\nlearning, and ability which marked his course at the bar. The careful\r\nstudent of our legislative history will not fail to perceive his\r\nobligations to Mr. Pickering, as the author of important reports and\r\nbills. The first bill for the separation of Maine from Massachusetts\r\nwas reported to the Senate by him in 1816, and though the object failed\r\nfor the time with the people of Maine, the bill is characterized by the\r\nhistorian of that State as \"drawn with great ability and skill.\"[144]\r\nThe report and accompanying bill on the jurisdiction and proceedings\r\nof the Courts of Probate, discussing and remodelling the whole system,\r\nwere from his hand.\r\n\r\n    [144] Williamson, History of Maine, Vol. II. p. 663.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 he was appointed to the vacancy, occasioned by the death of\r\nProfessor Ashmun, in the commission for revising and arranging the\r\nstatutes of Massachusetts, being associated in this important work with\r\nthose eminent lawyers, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Stearns. The first part,\r\nor that entitled _Of the Internal Administration of the Government_,\r\ncorresponding substantially with Blackstone's division _Of the Rights\r\nof Persons_, was executed by him. This alone entitles him to be\r\ngratefully remembered, not only by those having occasion to consult\r\nthe legislation of Massachusetts, but by all who feel an interest in\r\nscientific jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nHis contributions to what may be called the literature of his\r\nprofession were frequent. The American Jurist was often enriched by\r\narticles from his pen. Among these is a review of the valuable work of\r\nWilliams on the Law of Executors, and of Curtis's Admiralty Digest,\r\nwhere he examined the interesting history of this jurisdiction; also an\r\narticle on the Study of the Roman Law, where, within a short compass,\r\nhe presented a lucid history of this system, and the growth in Germany\r\nof the historical and didactic schools, \"rival houses,\" as they may\r\nbe called, in jurisprudence, whose long and unpleasant feud has only\r\nrecently subsided.\r\n\r\nIn the Law Reporter for September, 1841, he published an article of\r\nsingular merit, on National Rights and State Rights, being a review\r\nof the case of Alexander McLeod, recently determined in the Supreme\r\nCourt of New York. This was afterwards republished in a pamphlet, and\r\nextensively circulated. It is marked by uncommon learning, clearness,\r\nand power. The course of the courts of New York is handled with\r\nfreedom, and the supremacy of the Government vindicated. Of all the\r\ndiscussions elicited by that interesting question, on which, for a\r\nwhile, seemed to hang the portentous issues of peace and war between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain, that of Mr. Pickering will be\r\nadmitted to take the lead, whether we consider its character as\r\nan elegant composition, or as a searching review of the juridical\r\nquestions involved. In dealing with the opinion of Mr. Justice Cowen,\r\nrenowned for black-letter and the bibliography of the law, he shows\r\nhimself more than a match for this learned Judge, even in these\r\nunfrequented fields, while the spirit of the publicist and jurist gives\r\na refined temper to the whole article, which we vainly seek in the\r\nother production.\r\n\r\nIn the North American Review for October, 1840, is an article by him,\r\nillustrative of Conveyancing in Ancient Egypt, being an explanation of\r\nan Egyptian deed of a piece of land in hundred-gated Thebes, written\r\non papyrus, more than a century before the Christian era, with the\r\nimpression of a seal or stamp attached, and a certificate of registry\r\nin the margin, in as regular a manner as the keeper of the registry in\r\nthe County of Suffolk would certify to a deed of land in the City of\r\nBoston at this day. Jurisprudence is here adorned by scholarship.\r\n\r\nThere is another production which, like the preceding, belongs to the\r\ndepartment of literature as well as of jurisprudence: his Lecture on\r\nthe Alleged Uncertainty of the Law, delivered before the Boston Society\r\nfor the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Though written originally for\r\nthe general mind, which it is calculated to interest and instruct in\r\nno common degree, it will be read with equal advantage by the profound\r\nlawyer. It is not easy to mention any popular discussion of a juridical\r\ncharacter, in our language, deserving of higher regard. It was first\r\npublished in the American Jurist, at the solicitation of the writer of\r\nthis sketch, who has never referred to it without fresh admiration of\r\nthe happy illustrations and quiet reasoning by which it vindicates the\r\nscience of the law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn considering what Mr. Pickering accomplished out of his profession,\r\nwe are led over wide and various fields of learning, where we can\r\nonly hope to indicate his footprints, without presuming to examine or\r\ndescribe the ground.\r\n\r\nOne of his earliest cares was to elevate the character of classical\r\nstudies in our country. In this respect his own example did much.\r\nFrom the time he left the University, he was always regarded as an\r\nauthority on topics of scholarship. But his labors were devoted\r\nespecially to this cause. As early as 1805, in conjunction with his\r\nfriend, the present Judge White, of Salem, he published an edition of\r\nthe Histories of Sallust with Latin notes and a copious index. This is\r\none of the first examples, in our country, of a classic edited with\r\nscholarly skill. The same spirit led him, later in life, to publish in\r\nthe North American Review, and afterwards in a pamphlet, \"Observations\r\non the Importance of Greek Literature, and the Best Method of Studying\r\nthe Classics,\" translated from the Latin of Professor Wyttenbach. In\r\nthe course of the remarks with which he introduces the translation,\r\nhe urges with conclusive force the importance of raising the standard\r\nof education in our country. \"We are too apt,\" he says, \"to consider\r\nourselves as an insulated people, as not belonging to the great\r\ncommunity of Europe; but we are, in truth, just as much members of it,\r\nby means of a common public law, commercial intercourse, literature,\r\na kindred language and habits, as Englishmen or Frenchmen themselves\r\nare; and we must procure for ourselves the qualifications necessary\r\nto maintain that rank which we shall claim as equal members of such a\r\ncommunity.\"\r\n\r\nHis Remarks on Greek Grammars, which appeared in the American Journal\r\nof Education in 1825, belongs to the same field of labor, as does\r\nalso his admirable paper, published in 1818, in the Memoirs of the\r\nAmerican Academy, on the Proper Pronunciation of the Ancient Greek\r\nLanguage.[145] He maintained that it should be pronounced, as far\r\nas possible, according to the Romaic or modern Greek, and learnedly\r\nexposed the vicious usage introduced by Erasmus. His conclusions,\r\nthough controverted when first presented, are now substantially adopted\r\nby scholars. We well remember his honest pleasure in a communication\r\nreceived within a few years from President Moore, of Columbia College,\r\nin which that gentleman, who had once opposed his views, announced his\r\nchange, and, with the candor that becomes his honorable scholarship,\r\nvolunteered to them the sanction of his approbation.\r\n\r\n    [145] \"Observations upon the Greek Accent\" is the title of an essay\r\nin the Royal Irish Transactions, Vol. VII., by Dr. Browne, suggested,\r\nlike Mr. Pickering's, by conversation with some modern Greeks, and\r\ntouching upon similar topics. Dr. Browne is the author of the learned\r\nand somewhat antediluvian book on the Civil and Admiralty Law.\r\n\r\nThe Greek and English Lexicon is his work of greatest labor in the\r\ndepartment of classical learning. This alone would entitle him to\r\npraise from all who love liberal studies. With the well-thumbed copy of\r\nthis book, used in college days, now before us, we feel how much we are\r\ndebtor to his learned toil. Planned early in Mr. Pickering's life, it\r\nwas begun in 1814. The interruptions of his profession induced him to\r\nengage the assistance of the late Dr. Daniel Oliver, Professor of Moral\r\nand Intellectual Philosophy at Dartmouth College. The work, proceeding\r\nslowly, was not announced by a prospectus until 1820, and not finally\r\npublished until 1826. It was mainly founded on the well-known Lexicon\r\nof Schrevelius, which had received the emphatic commendation of\r\nVicesimus Knox, and was generally regarded as preferable to any other\r\nfor the use of schools. When Mr. Pickering commenced his labors there\r\nwas no Greek Lexicon with definitions in our own tongue. The English\r\nstudent obtained his knowledge of Greek through the intervention of\r\nLatin. And it is supposed by many, who have not sufficiently regarded\r\nother relations of the subject, as we are inclined to believe, that\r\nthis circuitous and awkward practice is a principal reason why Greek is\r\nso much less familiar to us than Latin. In honorable efforts to remove\r\nthis difficulty our countryman took the lead. Shortly before the last\r\nsheets of his Lexicon were printed, a copy of a London translation\r\nof Schrevelius reached this country, which proved, however to be\r\n\"a hurried performance, upon which it would not have been safe to\r\nrely.\"[146]\r\n\r\n    [146] Preface to Pickering's Lexicon.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of his Lexicon, several others in Greek and\r\nEnglish have appeared in England. The example of Germany and the\r\nlearning of her scholars have contributed to these works. It were\r\nto be wished that all of them were free from the imputation of an\r\nunhandsome appropriation of labors performed by others. The Lexicon\r\nof Dr. Dunbar, Professor of Greek in the University of Edinburgh,\r\npublished in 1840, contains whole pages taken bodily--\"convey, the wise\r\nit call\"--from that of Mr. Pickering, while the Preface is content\r\nwith an acknowledgment, in very general terms, of obligation to the\r\nwork which is copied. This is bad enough. But the second edition,\r\npublished in 1844, omits acknowledgment altogether; and the Lexicon\r\nis welcomed by an elaborate article in the Quarterly Review,[147] as\r\nthe triumphant labor of Dr. Dunbar, \"well known among our Northern\r\nclassics as a clever man and an acute scholar. _In almost every page_,\"\r\ncontinues the reviewer, \"_we meet with something which bespeaks the\r\npen of a scholar_; and we every now and then stumble on explanations\r\nof words and passages, occasionally fanciful, but always sensible,\r\nand sometimes ingenious, which amply repay us for the search.... _They\r\nprove, moreover, that the Professor is possessed of one quality which\r\nwe could wish to see more general: he does not see with the eyes of\r\nothers_; he thinks for himself, and he seems well qualified to do so.\"\r\nDid he not see with the eyes of others? The reviewer hardly supposed\r\nthat his commendation would reach the production of an American\r\nlexicographer.\r\n\r\n    [147] Vol. LXXV. p. 299.\r\n\r\nIn the general department of Languages and Philology his labors were\r\nvarious. Some of the publications already mentioned might be ranged\r\nunder this head. There are others which remain to be noticed. The\r\nearliest is the work generally called _The Vocabulary of Americanisms_,\r\nbeing a collection of words and phrases supposed to be peculiar to\r\nthe United States, with an Essay on the State of the English Language\r\nin this country. This originally appeared in the Memoirs of the\r\nAmerican Academy, in 1815, and republished in a separate volume, with\r\ncorrections and additions, in 1816. It was the author's intention, had\r\nhis life been spared, to print another edition, with the important\r\ngleanings of subsequent observation and study. Undoubtedly this work\r\nhas exerted a beneficial influence upon the purity of our language. It\r\nhas promoted careful habits of composition, and, in a certain degree,\r\nhelped to guard the \"well of English undefiled.\" Some of the words\r\nfound in this Vocabulary may be traced to ancient sources of authority;\r\nbut there are many which are beyond question provincial and barbarous,\r\nalthough much used in our common speech,--\"_fæx quoque quotidiani\r\nsermonis, foeda ac pudenda vitia_.\"[148]\r\n\r\n    [148] De Oratoribus Dialogus, c. 32,--sometimes attributed to Tacitus.\r\n\r\nIn the Memoirs of the American Academy for 1818 appeared his Essay on\r\na Uniform Orthography for the Indian Languages of North America. The\r\nuncertainty of their orthography arose from the circumstance that the\r\nwords were collected and reduced to writing by scholars of different\r\nnations, who often attached different values to the same letter,\r\nand represented the same sound by different letters; so that it was\r\nimpossible to determine the sound of a written word, without first\r\nknowing through what alembic of speech it had passed. Thus the words\r\nof the same language or dialect, written by a German, a Frenchman, or\r\nan Englishman, would seem to belong to languages as widely different\r\nas those of these different people. With the hope of removing from\r\nthe path of others the perplexities that had beset his own, Mr.\r\nPickering recommended the adoption of a common orthography, which\r\nwould enable foreigners to use our books without difficulty, and, on\r\nthe other hand, make theirs easy for us. To this end, he devised an\r\nalphabet for the Indian languages, which contained the common letters\r\nof our alphabet, so far as practicable, a class of nasals, also of\r\ndiphthongs, and, lastly, a number of compound characters, which it\r\nwas supposed would be of more or less frequent use in different\r\ndialects. With regard to this Essay, Mr. Du Ponceau said, at an\r\nearly day, \"If, as there is great reason to expect, Mr. Pickering's\r\northography gets into general use among us, America will have had\r\nthe honor of taking the lead in procuring an important auxiliary to\r\nphilological science.\"[149] Perhaps no single paper on language,\r\nsince the legendary labors of Cadmus, has exercised a more important\r\ninfluence than this communication. Though originally composed with a\r\nview to the Indian languages of North America, it has been successfully\r\nfollowed by the missionaries in the Polynesian Islands. In harmony with\r\nthe principles of this Essay, the unwritten dialect of the Sandwich\r\nIslands, possessing, it is said, a more than Italian softness, was\r\nreduced to writing according to a systematic orthography prepared by\r\nMr. Pickering, and is now employed in two newspapers published by\r\nnatives. Thus he may be regarded as one of the contributors to that\r\ncivilization, under whose gentle influence those islands, set like\r\nrichest gems in the bosom of the sea, will yet glow with the effulgence\r\nof Christian truth.\r\n\r\n    [149] Notes on Eliot's Indian Grammar, Mass. Hist. Coll., Second\r\nSeries, Vol. IX. p. xi. I cannot forbear adding, that in the\r\ncorrespondence of Leibnitz there is a proposition for a new alphabet of\r\nthe Arabic, Æthiopic, Syriac, and similar languages, which may remind\r\nthe reader of that of Mr. Pickering. Leibnitz, Opera (ed. Dutens), Vol.\r\nVI. p. 88.\r\n\r\nHis early studies in this branch are attested by an article in the\r\nNorth American Review for June, 1819, on Du Ponceau's Report on the\r\nLanguages of the American Indians, and another article in the same\r\nReview, for July, 1820, on Dr. Jarvis's Discourse on the Religion of\r\nthe Indian Tribes of North America. The latter attracted the particular\r\nattention of William von Humboldt.\r\n\r\nThe Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society contain several\r\nimportant communications from him on the Indian languages: in 1822\r\n(Vol. IX. Second Series) an edition of the Indian Grammar of Eliot,\r\nthe St. Augustin of New England, with Introductory Observations on the\r\nMassachusetts Language by the editor, and Notes by Mr. Du Ponceau,\r\ninscribed to his \"learned friend, Mr. Pickering, as a just tribute of\r\nfriendship and respect\";--in 1823 (Vol. X. Second Series) an edition\r\nof Jonathan Edwards's Observations on the Mohegan Language, with an\r\nAdvertisement and Copious Notes on the Indian Languages by the editor,\r\nand a Comparative Vocabulary of Various Dialects of the Lenape or\r\nDelaware Stock of North American Languages, together with a Specimen\r\nof the Winnebago Language;--in 1830 (Vol. II. Third Series) an edition\r\nof Cotton's Vocabulary of the Massachusetts Language. He also prepared\r\nRoger Williams's Vocabulary of the Narragansett Indians for the Rhode\r\nIsland Historical Society. These labors were calculated, in no ordinary\r\ndegree, to promote a knowledge of our aboriginal idioms, and to shed\r\nlight on that important and newly attempted branch of knowledge, the\r\nscience of Comparative Language.\r\n\r\nAmong the Memoirs of the American Academy, published in 1833, (Vol. I.\r\nNew Series) is the Dictionary of the Abnaki Language, in North America,\r\nby Father Sebastian Rasles, with an Introductory Memoir and Notes by\r\nMr. Pickering. The original manuscript of this copious Dictionary,\r\ncommenced by the good and indefatigable Jesuit in 1691, during his\r\nsolitary residence with the Indians, was found among his papers after\r\nthe massacre at Norridgewock, in which he was killed, and, passing\r\nthrough several hands, at last came into the possession of Harvard\r\nUniversity. It is considered one of the most interesting and authentic\r\ndocuments in the history of the North American languages. In the Memoir\r\naccompanying the Dictionary, Mr. Pickering, with the modesty which\r\nmarked all his labors, says that he made inquiries for memorials of\r\nthese languages, \"hoping that he might render some small service by\r\ncollecting and preserving these valuable materials for the use of those\r\npersons whose leisure and ability would enable them to employ them\r\nmore advantageously than it was in his power to do, for the benefit of\r\nphilological science.\"\r\n\r\nThe elaborate article on the Indian Languages of America in the\r\nEncyclopædia Americana is from his pen. The subject was considered so\r\ninteresting, in regard to general and comparative philology, while\r\nso little was known respecting it, that a space was allowed to this\r\narticle beyond that of other philological articles in the Encyclopædia.\r\nThe forthcoming volume of Memoirs of the American Academy contains\r\nan interesting paper of a kindred character, one of his latest\r\nproductions, on the Language and Inhabitants of Lord North's Island, in\r\nthe Indian Archipelago, with a Vocabulary.\r\n\r\nThe Address before the American Oriental Society, delivered and\r\npublished in 1843, as the first number of the Journal of that body, is\r\nan admirable contribution to the history of languages, presenting a\r\nsurvey of the peculiar field of labor to which the Society is devoted,\r\nin a style which attracts alike the scholar and the less critical\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nAmong his other productions in philology may be mentioned an\r\ninteresting article on the Chinese Language, which first appeared\r\nin the North American Review for January, 1839, and was afterwards\r\n_dishonestly reprinted, as an original article_, in the London Monthly\r\nReview for December, 1840; also an article on the Cochin-Chinese\r\nLanguage, published in the North American Review for April, 1841;\r\nanother on Adelung's \"Survey of Languages,\" in the same journal, in\r\n1822; a review of Johnson's Dictionary, in the American Quarterly\r\nReview for September, 1828; and two articles in the New York Review\r\nfor 1826, being a caustic examination of General Cass's article in the\r\nNorth American Review respecting the Indians of North America. These\r\ntwo papers were not acknowledged by their author at the time they were\r\nwritten. They purport to be by KASS-_ti-ga-tor-skee_, or _The Feathered\r\nArrow_, a fictitious name from the Latin CAS-_tigator_ and an Indian\r\ntermination _skee_ or _ski_.\r\n\r\nEven this enumeration does not close the catalogue of Mr. Pickering's\r\nproductions. There are others--to which, however, we refer by their\r\ntitles only--that may be classed with contributions to _general\r\nliterature_. Among these is an Oration delivered at Salem on the Fourth\r\nof July, 1804; an article in the Encyclopædia Americana, in 1829, on\r\nthe Agrarian Laws of Rome; an article in the North American Review\r\nfor April, 1829, on Elementary Instruction; an Introductory Essay\r\nto Newhall's Letters on Junius, in 1831; a Lecture on Telegraphic\r\nLanguage, before the Boston Marine Society, in 1833; an article on\r\nPeirce's History of Harvard University, in the North American Review\r\nfor April, 1834; an article on the South Sea Islands, in the American\r\nQuarterly Review for September, 1836; an article on Prescott's History\r\nof the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, in the New York Review for\r\nApril, 1838; the noble Eulogy on Dr. Bowditch, delivered before the\r\nAmerican Academy, May 29, 1838; and Obituary Notices of Mr. Peirce, the\r\nLibrarian of Harvard College, of Dr. Spurzheim, of Dr. Bowditch, and of\r\nhis valued friend and correspondent, the partner of his philological\r\nlabors, Mr. Du Ponceau; also an interesting Lecture, still unpublished,\r\non the Origin of the Population of America, and two others on Languages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reader will be astonished at these various contributions to\r\nlearning and literature, thus hastily reviewed, particularly when he\r\nregards them as the diversions of a life filled in amplest measure by\r\nother pursuits. Charles Lamb said that his _real works_ were not his\r\npublished writings, but the ponderous folios copied by his hand in\r\nthe India House. In the same spirit, Mr. Pickering might point to the\r\nmultitudinous transactions of his long professional life, cases argued\r\nin court, conferences with clients, and deeds, contracts, and other\r\npapers, in that clear, legible autograph which is a fit emblem of his\r\ntransparent character.\r\n\r\nHis professional life first invites attention. Here it should be\r\nobserved that he was a thorough, hard-working lawyer, for the greater\r\npart of his days in _full practice_, constant at his office, attentive\r\nto all the concerns of business, and to what may be called the\r\nhumilities of the profession. He was faithful, conscientious, and\r\ncareful; nor did his zeal for the interests committed to his care ever\r\nbetray him beyond the golden mean of duty. The law, in his hands, was a\r\nshield for defence, and never a sword to thrust at his adversary. His\r\npreparations for arguments in court were marked by peculiar care; his\r\nbrief was elaborate. On questions of law he was learned and profound;\r\nbut his manner in court was excelled by his matter. The experience of a\r\nlong life never enabled him to overcome the native childlike diffidence\r\nwhich made him shrink from public display. He developed his views with\r\nclearness and an invariable regard to their logical sequence,--but he\r\ndid not press them home by energy of manner, or any of the arts of\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nHis mind was rather judicial than forensic in cast. He was better able\r\nto discern the right than to make the wrong appear the better reason.\r\nHe was not a legal athlete, snuffing new vigor in the atmosphere of\r\nthe bar, and regarding success alone,--but a faithful counsellor,\r\nsolicitous for his client, and for justice too.\r\n\r\nIt was this character that led him to contemplate the law as a science,\r\nand to study its improvement and elevation. He could not look upon it\r\nmerely as the means of earning money. He gave much of his time to its\r\ngenerous culture. From the walks of practice he ascended to the heights\r\nof jurisprudence, embracing within his observation the systems of other\r\ncountries. His contributions to this department illustrate the turn and\r\nextent of his inquiries. It was his hope to accomplish some careful\r\nwork on the law, more elaborate than the memorials he has left. The\r\nsubject of the _Practice and Procedure of Courts_, or what is called\r\nby the civilians _Stylus Curiæ_, occupied his mind, and he intended to\r\ntreat it in the light of foreign authorities, particularly German and\r\nFrench, with the view of determining the general principles, or natural\r\nlaw, common to all systems, by which it is governed. Such a work,\r\nexecuted with the fine juridical spirit in which it was conceived,\r\nwould have been welcomed wherever the law is studied as a science.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, not only as lawyer, practising in courts, but as jurist,\r\nto whom the light of jurisprudence shone gladsome, that we are to\r\nesteem our departed friend. As such, his example will command attention\r\nand exert an influence long after the paper dockets in blue covers,\r\nchronicling the stages of litigation in his cases, are consigned to the\r\noblivion of dark closets and cobwebbed pigeon-holes.\r\n\r\nBut he has left a place vacant, not only in the halls of jurisprudence,\r\nbut also in the circle of scholars throughout the world, and, it may\r\nbe said, in the Pantheon of universal learning. Contemplating the\r\nvariety, the universality of his attainments, the mind, borrowing\r\nan epithet once applied to another, involuntarily exclaims, \"The\r\nadmirable Pickering!\" He seems, indeed, to have run the whole round of\r\nknowledge. His studies in ancient learning had been profound; nor can\r\nwe sufficiently admire the facility with which, amidst other cares, he\r\nassumed the task of lexicographer. Unless some memorandum should be\r\nfound among his papers, as was the case with Sir William Jones,[150]\r\nspecifying the languages to which he had been devoted, it might be\r\ndifficult to frame a list with entire accuracy. It is certain that\r\nhe was familiar with at least _nine_,--English, French, Portuguese,\r\nItalian, Spanish, German, Romaic, Greek, and Latin, of which he spoke\r\nthe first five. He was less familiar, though well acquainted, with\r\nDutch, Swedish, Danish, and Hebrew,--and had explored, with various\r\ndegrees of care, the Arabic, Turkish, Syriac, Persian, Coptic,\r\nSanscrit, Chinese, Cochin-Chinese, Russian, Egyptian hieroglyphics, the\r\nMalay in several dialects, and particularly the Indian languages of\r\nAmerica and the Polynesian Islands.\r\n\r\n    [150] Sir William Jones had studied eight languages\r\ncritically,--English, Latin, French, Italian, Greek, Arabic,\r\nPersian, Sanscrit; eight less perfectly, but all intelligible with\r\na dictionary,--Spanish, Portuguese, German, Runic, Hebrew, Bengali,\r\nHindi, Turkish; twelve least perfectly, but all attainable,--Tibetian,\r\nPâli, Phalavi, Deri, Russian, Syriac, Æthiopic, Coptic, Welsh, Swedish,\r\nDutch, Chinese: in all twenty-eight languages.--TEIGNMOUTH, _Life of\r\nJones_, p. 376, note.\r\n\r\nThe sarcasm of Hudibras on the \"barren ground\" supposed congenial to\r\n\"Hebrew roots\" is refuted by the richness of his accomplishments.\r\nHis style is that of a scholar and man of taste. It is simple,\r\nunpretending like its author, clear, accurate, and flows in an\r\neven tenor of elegance, which rises at times to a suavity almost\r\nXenophontian. Though little adorned by flowers of rhetoric, it shows\r\nthe sensibility and refinement of an ear attuned to the harmonies of\r\nlanguage. He had cultivated music as a science, and in his younger\r\ndays performed on the flute with Grecian fondness. Some of the airs\r\nhe had learned in Portugal were sung to him by his daughter shortly\r\nbefore his death, bringing with them, doubtless, the pleasant memories\r\nof early travel and the \"incense-breathing morn\" of life. A lover of\r\nmusic, he was naturally inclined to the other fine arts, but always had\r\nparticular pleasure in works of sculpture.\r\n\r\nNor were those other studies which are sometimes regarded as of a more\r\npractical character foreign to his mind. In college days he was noticed\r\nfor his attainments in mathematics; and later in life he perused\r\nwith intelligent care the great work of his friend, Dr. Bowditch,\r\nthe translation of the _Mécanique Celeste_. He was chairman of the\r\ncommittee which recommended the purchase of a first-class telescope for\r\nthe neighborhood of Boston, and was the author of their interesting\r\nreport on the use and importance of such an instrument. He was partial\r\nto natural history, particularly botany, which he taught to some of his\r\nfamily. In addition to all this, he possessed a natural aptitude for\r\nthe mechanic arts, which was improved by observation and care. Early\r\nin life he learned to use the turning-lathe, and, as he declared in an\r\nunpublished lecture before the Mechanics' Institute of Boston, _made\r\ntoys which he bartered among his school-mates_.\r\n\r\nThis last circumstance gives singular point to the parallel, already\r\nstriking in other respects, between him and the Greek orator, the\r\nboast of whose various knowledge is preserved by Cicero: \"Nihil esse\r\nulla in arte rerum omnium, quod ipse nesciret: nec solum has artes,\r\nquibus liberales doctrinæ atque ingenuæ continerentur, geometriam,\r\nmusicam, literarum cognitionem et poetarum, atque illa, quæ de naturis\r\nrerum, quæ de hominum moribus, quæ de rebuspublicis dicerentur; _sed\r\nannulum, quem haberet, se sua manu confecisse_.\"[151] The Greek,\r\nbesides knowing everything, made the ring which he wore, as our friend\r\nmade toys.\r\n\r\n    [151] De Oratore, Lib. III. cap. 32.\r\n\r\nAs the champion of classical studies, and a student of language,\r\nor philologist, he is entitled to be specially remembered. It is\r\nimpossible to measure the influence he has exerted upon the scholarship\r\nof the country. His writings and his example, from early youth, pleaded\r\nits cause, and will plead it ever, although his living voice is hushed\r\nin the grave. His genius for languages was profound. He saw, with\r\nintuitive perception, their structure and affinities, and delighted\r\nin the detection of their hidden resemblances and relations. To their\r\nhistory and character he devoted his attention, more than to their\r\nliterature. It is not possible for this humble pen to determine the\r\nplace which will be allotted to him in the science of philology; but\r\nthe writer cannot forbear recording the authoritative testimony to\r\nthe rare merits of Mr. Pickering in this department, which it was his\r\nfortune to hear from the lips of Alexander von Humboldt. With the\r\nbrother, William von Humboldt, that great light of modern philology, he\r\nmaintained a long correspondence, particularly on the Indian languages;\r\nand his letters will be found preserved in the Royal Library at Berlin.\r\nWithout rashly undertaking to indicate any scale of pre-eminence or\r\nprecedence among the cultivators of this department, at home or abroad,\r\nit may not be improper to refer to his labors in those words of Dr.\r\nJohnson with regard to his own, as evidence \"that we may no longer\r\nyield the palm of philology, without a contest, to the nations of the\r\nContinent.\"[152]\r\n\r\n    [152] Preface to Dictionary.\r\n\r\nIf it should be asked by what magic Mr. Pickering was able to\r\naccomplish these remarkable results, it must be answered, By the\r\ncareful husbandry of time. His talisman was industry. He delighted in\r\nreferring to those rude inhabitants of Tartary who placed idleness\r\namong the torments of the world to come, and often remembered the\r\nbeautiful proverb in his Oriental studies, that by labor the leaf of\r\nthe mulberry is turned into silk. His life is a perpetual commentary on\r\nthose words of untranslatable beauty in the great Italian poet:--\r\n\r\n    \"Seggendo in piuma,\r\n     In fama non si vien, nè sotto coltre:\r\n     Sanza la qual, chi sua vita consuma,\r\n     Cotal vestigio in terra di se lascia,\r\n     Qual fumo in aere od in acqua la schiuma.\"[153]\r\n\r\n    [153] Divina Commedia, _Inferno_, Canto XXIV. vv. 47-51.\r\n\r\nWith a mind thus deeply imbued with learning, it will be felt that\r\nhe was formed less for the contentions of the forum than for the\r\nexercises of the academy. And yet it is understood that he declined\r\nseveral opportunities of entering its learned retreats. In 1806 he was\r\nelected Hancock Professor of Hebrew and other Oriental Languages in\r\nHarvard University; and at a later day he was invited to the chair of\r\nGreek Literature in the same institution. On the death of Professor\r\nAshmun, many eyes were turned towards him, as fitted to occupy the\r\nprofessorship of law in Cambridge, since so ably filled by Mr.\r\nGreenleaf; and on two different occasions his name was echoed by the\r\npublic prints as about to receive the dignity of President of the\r\nUniversity. But he continued in the practice of the law to the last.\r\n\r\nHe should be claimed by the bar with peculiar pride. If it be true, as\r\nhas been said, that Serjeant Talfourd has reflected more honor upon his\r\nprofession by the successful cultivation of letters than any of his\r\ncontemporaries by their forensic triumphs, then should the American\r\nbar acknowledge their obligations to the fame of Mr. Pickering. He was\r\none of us. He was a _regular_ in our ranks; in other service, only a\r\n_volunteer_.\r\n\r\nThe mind is led instinctively to a parallel between him and that\r\nillustrious scholar and jurist, ornament of the English law, and\r\npioneer of Oriental studies in England, Sir William Jones, to whom I\r\nhave already referred. Both confessed, in early life, the attractions\r\nof classical studies; both were trained in the discipline of the law;\r\nboth, though engaged in its practice, always delighted to contemplate\r\nit as a science; both surrendered themselves with irrepressible ardor\r\nto the study of languages, while the one broke into the unexplored\r\nfields of Eastern philology, and the other devoted himself more\r\nespecially to the native tongues of his own Western continent. Their\r\nnames are, perhaps, equally conspicuous for the number of languages\r\nwhich occupied their attention. As we approach them in private life,\r\nthe parallel still continues. In both there were the same truth,\r\ngenerosity, and gentleness, a cluster of noble virtues,--while the\r\nintenser earnestness of the one is compensated by the greater modesty\r\nof the other. To our American jurist-scholar, also, may be applied\r\nthose words of the Greek couplet, borrowed from Aristophanes, and\r\nfirst appropriated to his English prototype: \"The Graces, seeking a\r\nshrine that would not decay, found the soul of Jones.\"\r\n\r\nWhile dwelling with admiration upon his triumphs of intellect and the\r\nfame he has won, we must not forget the virtues, higher than intellect\r\nor fame, by which his life was adorned. In the jurist and the scholar\r\nwe must not lose sight of the _man_. So far as is allotted to a mortal,\r\nhe was a spotless character. The murky tides of this world seemed to\r\nflow by without soiling his garments. He was pure in thought, word,\r\nand deed; a lover of truth, goodness, and humanity; the friend of the\r\nyoung, encouraging them in their studies, and aiding them by wise\r\ncounsels; ever kind, considerate, and gentle to all; towards children,\r\nand the unfortunate, full of tenderness. He was of charming modesty.\r\nWith learning to which all bowed with reverence, he walked humbly\r\nbefore God and man. His pleasures were simple. In the retirement of\r\nhis study, and the blandishments of his music-loving family, he found\r\nrest from the fatigues of the bar. He never spoke in anger, nor did any\r\nhate find a seat in his bosom. His placid life was, like law in the\r\ndefinition of Aristotle, \"mind without passion.\"\r\n\r\nThrough his long and industrious career he was blessed with unbroken\r\nhealth. He walked on earth with an unailing body and a serene mind;\r\nand at last, in the fulness of time, when the garner was overflowing\r\nwith the harvests of a well-spent life, in the bosom of his family, the\r\nsilver cord was gently loosed. He died at Boston, May 5, 1846, in the\r\nseventieth year of his age,--only a few days after he had prepared for\r\nthe press the last sheets of a new and enlarged edition of his Greek\r\nLexicon. His wife, to whom he was married in 1805, and three children,\r\nsurvive to mourn their irreparable loss.\r\n\r\nThe number of societies, both at home and abroad, of which he was an\r\nhonored member, attests the widespread recognition of his merits. He\r\nwas President of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; President\r\nof the American Oriental Society; Foreign Secretary of the American\r\nAntiquarian Society; Fellow of the Massachusetts Historical Society,\r\nthe American Ethnological Society, the American Philosophical Society;\r\nHonorary Member of the Historical Societies of New Hampshire, Rhode\r\nIsland, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, and Georgia;\r\nHonorary Member of the National Institution for the Promotion of\r\nScience, the American Statistical Association, the Northern Academy of\r\nArts and Sciences, Hanover, N.H., and the Society for the Promotion\r\nof Legal Knowledge, Philadelphia; Corresponding Member of the Academy\r\nof Sciences at Berlin, the Oriental Society of Paris, the Academy of\r\nSciences and Letters at Palermo, the Antiquarian Society at Athens,\r\nand the Royal Northern Antiquarian Society at Copenhagen; and Titular\r\nMember of the French Society of Universal Statistics.\r\n\r\nFor many years he maintained a copious correspondence, on matters of\r\njurisprudence, science, and learning, with distinguished names at home\r\nand abroad: especially with Mr. Du Ponceau, at Philadelphia,--with\r\nWilliam von Humboldt, at Berlin,--with Mittermaier, the jurist, at\r\nHeidelberg,--with Dr. Prichard, author of the Physical History of\r\nMankind, at Bristol,--and with Lepsius, the hierologist, who wrote to\r\nhim from the foot of the Pyramids, in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe death of one thus variously connected is no common sorrow. Beyond\r\nthe immediate circle of family and friends, he will be mourned by the\r\nbar, among whom his daily life was passed,--by the municipality of\r\nBoston, whose legal adviser he was,--by clients, who depended upon his\r\ncounsels,--by good citizens, who were charmed by the abounding virtues\r\nof his private life,--by his country, who will cherish his name more\r\nthan gold or silver,--by the distant islands of the Pacific, who will\r\nbless his labors in the words they read,--finally, by the company of\r\njurists and scholars throughout the world. His fame and his works will\r\nbe fitly commemorated, on formal occasions, hereafter. Meanwhile, one\r\nwho knew him at the bar and in private life, and who loves his memory,\r\nlays this early tribute upon his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       THE SCHOLAR, THE JURIST, THE ARTIST, THE PHILANTHROPIST.\r\n\r\nAN ORATION BEFORE THE PHI BETA KAPPA SOCIETY OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY, AT\r\n                  THEIR ANNIVERSARY, AUGUST 27, 1846.\r\n\r\n    Then I would say to the young disciple of Truth and Beauty, who\r\n    would know how to satisfy the noble impulse of his heart, through\r\n    every opposition of the century,--I would say, Give the world\r\n    beneath your influence a _direction_ towards the good, and the\r\n    tranquil rhythm of time will bring its development.--SCHILLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In this Oration, as in that of the 4th of July, Mr. Sumner took\r\n    advantage of the occasion to express himself freely, especially\r\n    on the two great questions of Slavery and War. In the sensitive\r\n    condition of public sentiment at that time, such an effort would\r\n    have found small indulgence, if he had not placed himself behind\r\n    four such names. While commemorating the dead, he was able to\r\n    uphold living truth.\r\n\r\n    The acceptance of this Oration at the time is attested by the toast\r\n    of John Quincy Adams at the dinner of the Society:--\r\n\r\n    \"The memory of the Scholar, the Jurist, the Artist, the\r\n    Philanthropist; and not the memory, but the long life of the\r\n    kindred spirit who has this day embalmed them all.\"\r\n\r\n    This was followed by a letter from Mr. Adams to Mr. Sumner, dated\r\n    at Quincy, August 29, 1846, containing the following passage:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is a gratification to me to have the opportunity to repeat the\r\n    thanks which I so cordially gave you at the close of your oration\r\n    of last Thursday, and of which the sentiment offered by me at the\r\n    dinner-table was but an additional pulsation from the same heart.\r\n    I trust I may now congratulate you on the felicity, first of your\r\n    selection of your subject, and secondly of its consummation in the\r\n    delivery.... The pleasure with which I listened to your discourse\r\n    was inspired far less by the success and _all but_ universal\r\n    acceptance and applause of the present moment than by the vista of\r\n    the future which is opened to my view. Casting my eyes backward no\r\n    farther than the 4th of July of last year, when you set all the\r\n    vipers of Alecto a-hissing by proclaiming the Christian law of\r\n    universal peace and love, and then casting them forward, perhaps\r\n    not much farther, but beyond my own allotted time, I see you have\r\n    a mission to perform. I look from Pisgah to the Promised Land; you\r\n    must enter upon it.... To the motto on my seal [_Alteri sæculo_]\r\n    add _Delenda est servitus_.\"\r\n\r\n    Similar testimony was offered by Edward Everett in a letter dated\r\n    at Cambridge, September 5, 1846, where he thanks Mr. Sumner for\r\n    his \"most magnificent address,--an effort certainly of unsurpassed\r\n    felicity and power,\"--then in another letter dated at Cambridge,\r\n    September 25th, where he writes: \"I read it last evening with a\r\n    renewal of the delight with which I heard it. Should you never\r\n    do anything else, you have done enough for fame; but you are, as\r\n    far as these public efforts are concerned, at the commencement\r\n    of a career, destined, I trust, to last for long years, of\r\n    ever-increasing usefulness and honor.\"\r\n\r\n    Mr. Prescott, under date of October 2d, writes:--\r\n\r\n    \"The most happy conception has been carried out admirably, as\r\n    if it were the most natural order of things, without the least\r\n    constraint or violence. I don't know which of your sketches I like\r\n    the best. I am inclined to think the Judge; for there you are on\r\n    your own heather, and it is the tribute of a favorite pupil to his\r\n    well-loved master, gushing warm from the heart. Yet they are all\r\n    managed well; and the vivid touches of character and the richness\r\n    of the illustration will repay the study, I should imagine, of any\r\n    one familiar with the particular science you discuss.\"\r\n\r\n    Chancellor Kent, of New York, under date of October 6th, expresses\r\n    himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"I had the pleasure to receive your Phi Beta Kappa Address, and I\r\n    think it to be one of the most splendid productions in point of\r\n    diction and eloquence that I have ever read. You brought a most\r\n    fervent mind to the task, glowing with images of transcendent\r\n    worth, and embellished with classical and literary allusions drawn\r\n    from your memory and guided by your taste, with extraordinary\r\n    force.... You have raised a noble monument to the four great men\r\n    who have adorned your State, and I feel deeply humbled with a sense\r\n    of my own miserable inferiority when I contemplate such exalted\r\n    models.\"\r\n\r\n    These contemporary tokens of friendship and sympathy seem a proper\r\n    part of this record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day is the festival of our fraternity, sacred to learning, to\r\nfriendship, and to truth. From many places, remote and near, we have\r\ncome together beneath the benediction of Alma Mater. We have walked\r\nin the grateful shelter of her rich embowering trees. Friend has\r\nmet friend, classmate has pressed the hand of classmate, while the\r\nruddy memories of youth and early study have risen upon the soul. And\r\nnow we have come up to this church, a company of brothers, in long,\r\nwell-ordered procession, commencing with the silver locks of reverend\r\nage, and closing with the fresh faces that glow with the golden blood\r\nof youth.\r\n\r\nWith hearts of gratitude, we greet among our number those whose\r\nlives are crowned by desert,--especially him who, returning from\r\nconspicuous cares in a foreign land, now graces our chief seat of\r\nlearning,[154]--and not less him who, closing, in the high service\r\nof the University, a life-long career of probity and honor, now\r\nvoluntarily withdraws to a scholar's repose.[155] We salute at once\r\nthe successor and the predecessor, the rising and the setting sun.\r\nAnd ingenuous youth, in whose bosom are infolded the germs of untold\r\nexcellence, whose ardent soul sees visions closed to others by the\r\nhand of Time, commands our reverence not less than age rich in\r\nexperience and honor. The Present and the Past, with all their works,\r\nwe know and measure; but the triumphs of the Future are unknown and\r\nimmeasurable;--therefore is there in the yet untried powers of youth a\r\nvastness of promise to quicken the regard. Welcome, then, not less the\r\nyoung than the old! and may this our holiday brighten with harmony and\r\njoy!\r\n\r\n    [154] Hon. Edward Everett, President of Harvard University.\r\n\r\n    [155] Hon. Josiah Quincy, late President of Harvard University.\r\n\r\nAs the eye wanders around our circle, Mr. President, in vain it seeks\r\na beloved form, for many years so welcome in the seat you now fill.\r\nI might have looked to behold him on this occasion. But death, since\r\nwe last met together, has borne him away. The love of friends, the\r\ndevotion of pupils, the prayers of the nation, the concern of the\r\nworld, could not shield him from the inexorable shaft. Borrowing for\r\nhim those words of genius and friendship which gushed from Clarendon\r\nat the name of Falkland, that he was \"a person of prodigious parts\r\nof learning and knowledge, of inimitable sweetness and delight in\r\nconversation, of flowing and obliging humanity and goodness to mankind,\r\nand of primitive simplicity and integrity of life,\"[156] I need not add\r\nthe name of STORY. To dwell on his character, and all that he has done,\r\nwere a worthy theme. But his is not the only well-loved countenance\r\nwhich returns no answering smile.\r\n\r\n    [156] History of the Rebellion, Book VII.\r\n\r\nThis year our Society, according to custom, publishes the catalogue of\r\nits members, marking by a star the insatiate archery of Death during\r\nthe brief space of four years. In no period of its history, equally\r\nshort, have such shining marks been found.\r\n\r\n    \"Now kindred Merit fills the sable bier,\r\n     Now lacerated Friendship claims a tear;\r\n     Year chases year, decay pursues decay,\r\n     Still drops some joy from withering life away.\"[157]\r\n\r\n    [157] Johnson, Vanity of Human Wishes, vv. 303-306.\r\n\r\nScholarship, Jurisprudence, Art, Humanity, each is called to mourn a\r\nchosen champion. Pickering the Scholar, Story the Jurist, Allston the\r\nArtist, Channing the Philanthropist, are gone. When our last catalogue\r\nwas published they were all living, each in his field of fame. Our\r\ncatalogue of this year gathers them with the peaceful dead. Sweet and\r\nexalted companionship! They were joined in life, in renown, and in\r\ndeath. They were brethren of our fraternity, sons of Alma Mater. Story\r\nand Channing were classmates; Pickering preceded them by two years\r\nonly, Allston followed them by two years. Casting our eyes upon the\r\nclosing lustre of the last century, we discern this brilliant group\r\nwhose mortal light is now obscured. After the toils of his long life,\r\nPickering sleeps serenely in the place of his birth, near the honored\r\ndust of his father. Channing, Story, and Allston have been laid to\r\nrest in Cambridge, where they first tasted together the tree of life:\r\nAllston in the adjoining church-yard, within sound of the voice that\r\nnow addresses you; Channing and Story in the pleasant, grassy bed\r\nof Mount Auburn, under the shadow of beautiful trees, whose falling\r\nautumnal leaves are fit emblem of the generations of men.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in ancient Rome, on solemn occasions, to bring\r\nforward the images of departed friends, arrayed in robes of office,\r\nand carefully adorned, while some one recounted what they had done,\r\nin the hope of refreshing the memory of their deeds, and of inspiring\r\nthe living with new impulse to virtue. \"For who,\" says the ancient\r\nhistorian, \"can behold without emotion the forms of so many illustrious\r\nmen, thus living, as it were, and breathing together in his presence?\r\nor what spectacle can be conceived more great and striking?\"[158]\r\nThe images of our departed brothers are present here to-day, not in\r\nsculptured marble, but graven on our hearts. We behold them again, as\r\nin life. They mingle in our festival, and cheer us by their presence.\r\nIt were well to catch the opportunity of observing together their\r\nwell-known lineaments, and of dwelling anew, with warmth of living\r\naffection, upon the virtues by which they are commended. Devoting the\r\nhour to their memory, we may seek also to comprehend and reverence\r\nthe great interests which they lived to promote. Pickering, Story,\r\nAllston, Channing! Their names alone, without addition, awaken a\r\nresponse, which, like the far-famed echo of Dodona, will prolong\r\nitself through the live-long day. But, great as they are, we feel\r\ntheir insignificance by the side of those great causes to which their\r\ndays were consecrated,--_Knowledge_, _Justice_, _Beauty_, _Love_, the\r\ncomprehensive attributes of God. Illustrious on earth, they were but\r\nlowly and mortal ministers of lofty and immortal truth. It is, then,\r\nTHE SCHOLAR, THE JURIST, THE ARTIST, THE PHILANTHROPIST, whom we\r\ncelebrate to-day, and whose pursuits will be the theme of my discourse.\r\n\r\n    [158] Hampton's Polybius, Book VI. Ext. II. ch. 2.\r\n\r\nHere, on this threshold, let me say, what is implied in the very\r\nstatement of my subject, that, in offering these tributes, I seek no\r\noccasion for personal eulogy or biographical detail. My aim is to\r\ncommemorate the men, but more to advance the objects which they so\r\nsuccessfully served. Reversing the order in which they left us, I shall\r\ntake the last first.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN PICKERING, THE SCHOLAR, died in the month of May, 1846, aged\r\nsixty-nine, within a short distance of that extreme goal which is the\r\nallotted limit of human life. By Scholar I mean a cultivator of liberal\r\nstudies, a student of knowledge in its largest sense,--not merely\r\nclassical, not excluding what in our day is exclusively called science,\r\nbut which was unknown when the title of scholar first prevailed; for\r\nthough Cicero dealt a sarcasm at Archimedes, he spoke with higher\r\ntruth when he beautifully recognized the common bond between all\r\ndepartments of knowledge. The brother whom we mourn was a scholar, a\r\nstudent, as long as he lived. His place was not merely among those\r\ncalled by courtesy _Educated Men_, with most of whom education is\r\npast and gone,--men who have studied; he studied always. Life to him\r\nwas an unbroken lesson, pleasant with the charm of knowledge and the\r\nconsciousness of improvement.\r\n\r\nThe world knows and reveres his learning; they only who partook\r\nsomewhat of his daily life fully know the modesty of his character. His\r\nknowledge was such that he seemed to be ignorant of nothing, while,\r\nin the perfection of his humility, he might seem to know nothing. By\r\nlearning conspicuous before the world, his native diffidence withdrew\r\nhim from its personal observation. Surely, learning so great, which\r\nclaimed so little, will not be forgotten. The modesty which detained\r\nhim in retirement during life introduces him now that he is dead.\r\nStrange reward! Merit which shrank from the living gaze is now observed\r\nof all men. The voice once so soft is returned in echoes from the tomb.\r\n\r\nI place in the front his modesty and his learning, two attributes by\r\nwhich he will be always remembered. I might enlarge on his sweetness of\r\ntemper, his simplicity of life, his kindness to the young, his sympathy\r\nwith studies of all kinds, his sensibility to beauty, his conscientious\r\ncharacter, his passionless mind. Could he speak to us of himself, he\r\nmight adopt words of self-painting from the candid pen of his eminent\r\npredecessor in the cultivation of Grecian literature, leader of its\r\nrevival in Europe, as Pickering was leader in America,--the urbane\r\nand learned Erasmus. \"For my own part,\" says the early scholar to\r\nhis English friend, John Colet, \"I best know my own failings, and\r\ntherefore shall presume to give a character of myself. You have in me\r\na man of little or no fortune,--a stranger to ambition,--of a strong\r\npropensity to loving-kindness and friendship,--without any boast of\r\nlearning, but a great admirer of it,--one who has a profound veneration\r\nfor any excellence in others, however he may feel the want of it in\r\nhimself,--who can readily yield to others in learning, but to none in\r\nintegrity,--a man sincere, open, and free,--a hater of falsehood and\r\ndissimulation,--of a mind lowly and upright,--of few words, and who\r\nboasts of nothing but an honest heart.\"[159]\r\n\r\n    [159] Erasmi Epist., Lib. V. Ep. 4.\r\n\r\nI have called him Scholar; for it is in this character that he leaves\r\nso excellent an example. But the triumphs of his life are enhanced by\r\nthe variety of his labors, and especially by his long career at the\r\nbar. He was a lawyer, whose days were spent in the faithful practice\r\nof his profession, busy with clients, careful of their concerns in\r\ncourt and out of court. Each day witnessed his untiring exertion in\r\nscenes little attractive to his gentle and studious nature. He was\r\nformed to be a seeker of truth rather than a defender of wrong; and\r\nhe found less satisfaction in the strifes of the bar than in the\r\nconversation of books. To him litigation was a sorry feast, and a\r\nwell-filled docket of cases not unlike the curious and now untasted\r\ndish of \"nettles,\" in the first course of a Roman banquet. He knew that\r\nthe duties of the profession were important, but felt that even their\r\nsuccessful performance, when unattended by juridical culture, gave\r\nsmall title to regard, while they were less pleasant and ennobling than\r\nthe disinterested pursuit of learning. He would have said, at least as\r\nregards his own profession, with the Lord Archon of the _Oceana_, \"I\r\nwill stand no more to the judgment of lawyers and divines than to that\r\nof _so many other tradesmen_.\"[160]\r\n\r\n    [160] Harrington's Oceana, p. 134.\r\n\r\nIt was the law as a _trade_ that he pursued reluctantly, while he had\r\ntrue happiness in the science of jurisprudence, to which he devoted\r\nmany hours rescued from other cares. By example, and contributions\r\nof the pen, he elevated the study, and invested it with the charm of\r\nliberal pursuits. By marvellous assiduity he was able to lead two\r\nlives,--one producing the fruits of earth, the other of immortality.\r\nIn him was the union, rare as it is grateful, of lawyer and scholar.\r\nHe has taught how much may be done for jurisprudence and learning even\r\namidst the toils of professional life; while the enduring lustre of his\r\nname contrasts with the fugitive reputation which is the lot of the\r\n_mere lawyer_, although clients beat at his gates from cock-crow at the\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nTo describe his labors of scholarship would be impossible on this\r\noccasion. Although important contributions to the sum of knowledge,\r\nthey were of a character only slightly appreciated by the world at\r\nlarge. They were chiefly directed to two subjects,--classical studies\r\nand general philology, if these two may be regarded separately.\r\n\r\nHis early life was marked by a particular interest in _classical\r\nstudies_. At a time when, in our country, accurate and extensive\r\nscholarship was rare, he aspired to possess it. By daily and nightly\r\ntoil he mastered the great exemplars of antiquity, and found delight\r\nin their beauties. His example was persuasive. And he added earnest\r\neffort to promote their study in the learned seminaries of our country.\r\nWith unanswerable force he urged among us a standard of education\r\ncommensurate, in every substantial respect, with that of Europe. He\r\ndesired for the American youth on his native soil, under the influence\r\nof free institutions, a course of instruction rendering foreign aid\r\nsuperfluous. He had a just pride of country, and longed for its good\r\nname through accomplished representatives, well knowing that the\r\nAmerican scholar, wherever he wanders in foreign lands, is a living\r\nrecommendation of the institutions under which he was reared.\r\n\r\nHe knew that scholarship of all kinds would gild the life of its\r\npossessor, enlarge the resources of the bar, enrich the voice of the\r\npulpit, and strengthen the learning of medicine. He knew that it would\r\nafford a soothing companionship in hours of relaxation from labor,\r\nin periods of sadness, and in the evening of life; that, when once\r\nembraced, it was more constant than friendship,--attending its votary,\r\nas an invisible spirit, in the toils of the day, the watches of the\r\nnight, the changes of travel, and the alternations of fortune or health.\r\n\r\nIn commending classical studies it would be difficult to say that he\r\nattached to them undue importance. By his own example he showed that\r\nhe bore them no exclusive love. He regarded them as an essential part\r\nof liberal education, opening the way to other realms of knowledge,\r\nwhile they mature the taste and invigorate the understanding. Here\r\nprobably all will concur. It may be questioned, whether, in our hurried\r\nAmerican life, it is possible, with proper regard for other studies,\r\nto introduce into ordinary classical education the exquisite skill\r\nwhich is the pride of English scholarship, reminding us of the minute\r\nfinish in Chinese art,--or the ponderous and elaborate learning which\r\nis the wonder of Germany, reminding us of the unnatural perspective in\r\na Chinese picture. But much will be done, if we establish those habits\r\nof accuracy, acquired only through early and careful training, which\r\nenable us at least to appreciate the severe beauty of antiquity, while\r\nthey become an invaluable standard and measure of attainment in other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe classics possess a peculiar charm, as models, I might say masters,\r\nof composition and form. In the contemplation of these august teachers\r\nwe are filled with conflicting emotions. They are the early voice of\r\nthe world, better remembered and more cherished than any intermediate\r\nvoice,--as the language of childhood still haunts us, when the\r\nutterances of later years are effaced from the mind. But they show the\r\nrudeness of the world's childhood, before passion yielded to the sway\r\nof reason and the affections. They want purity, righteousness, and\r\nthat highest charm which is found in love to God and man. Not in the\r\nfrigid philosophy of the Porch and the Academy are we to seek these;\r\nnot in the marvellous teachings of Socrates, as they come mended by the\r\nmellifluous words of Plato; not in the resounding line of Homer, on\r\nwhose inspiring tale of blood Alexander pillowed his head; not in the\r\nanimated strain of Pindar, where virtue is pictured in the successful\r\nstrife of an athlete at the Olympian games; not in the torrent of\r\nDemosthenes, dark with self-love and the spirit of vengeance; not in\r\nthe fitful philosophy and boastful eloquence of Tully; not in the\r\ngenial libertinism of Horace, or the stately atheism of Lucretius. To\r\nthese we give admiration; but they cannot be our highest teachers. In\r\nnone of these is the way of life. For eighteen hundred years the spirit\r\nof these classics has been in constant contention with the Sermon on\r\nthe Mount, and with those two sublime commandments on which \"hang all\r\nthe law and the prophets.\"[161] The strife is still pending, and who\r\nshall say when it will end? Heathenism, which possessed itself of\r\nsuch Siren forms, is not yet exorcised. Even now it exerts a powerful\r\nsway, imbuing youth, coloring the thought of manhood, and haunting the\r\nmeditation of age. Widening still in sphere, it embraces nations as\r\nwell as individuals, until it seems to sit supreme.\r\n\r\n    [161] Terence, taught, perhaps, by his own bitter experience as slave,\r\nhas given expression to truth almost Christian, when he says,--\r\n\r\n\"Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto.\"\r\n\r\n_Heauton._, Act I. Sc. 1.\r\n\r\nAnd in the _Andria_,--\r\n\r\n\"Facile omnes perferre ac pati, Cum quibus erat cunque una: iis sese\r\ndedere: Eorum obsequi studiis: advorsus nemini: Nunquam præponens se\r\nillis.\" Act I. Sc. 1.\r\n\r\nOur own productions, though yielding to the ancient in arrangement,\r\nmethod, beauty of form, and freshness of illustration, are superior\r\nin truth, delicacy, and elevation of sentiment,--above all, in the\r\nrecognition of that peculiar revelation, the Brotherhood of Man. Vain\r\nare eloquence and poetry, compared with this heaven-descended truth.\r\nPut in one scale that simple utterance, and in the other all the lore\r\nof antiquity, with its accumulating glosses and commentaries, and the\r\nlatter will be light in the balance. Greek poetry has been likened to\r\nthe song of the nightingale, as she sits in the rich, symmetrical crown\r\nof the palm-tree, trilling her thick-warbled notes; but these notes\r\nwill not compare in sweetness with those teachings of charity which\r\nbelong to our Christian inheritance.\r\n\r\nThese things cannot be forgotten by the scholar. From the Past he may\r\ndraw all it can contribute to the great end of life, human progress\r\nand happiness,--progress, without which happiness is vain. But he must\r\nclose his soul to the hardening influence of that spirit, which is more\r\nto be dreaded, as it is enshrined in compositions of such commanding\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n    \"Sunk in Homer's mine,\r\n     I lose my precious years, now soon to fail,\r\n     Handling his gold; which, howsoe'er it shine,\r\n     Proves dross, when balanced in the Christian scale.\"[162]\r\n\r\n    [162] Cowper, Sonnet to John Johnson: Minor Poems.\r\n\r\nIn the department of _philology_, kindred to that of the classics,\r\nour Scholar labored with similar success. Unlike Sir William Jones\r\nin genius, he was like this English scholar in the multitude of\r\nlanguages he embraced. Distance of time and space was forgotten, as\r\nhe explored the far-off primeval Sanscrit,--the hieroglyphics of\r\nEgypt, now awakening from the mute repose of centuries,--the polite\r\nand learned tongues of ancient and modern Europe,--the languages of\r\nMohammedanism,--the various dialects in the forests of North America,\r\nand in the sandal-groves of the Pacific,--only closing with a _lingua\r\nfranca_ from an unlettered tribe on the coast of Africa, to which his\r\nattention was called during the illness which ended in death.\r\n\r\nThis recital exhibits the variety and extent of his studies in a\r\ndepartment which is supposed inaccessible, except to peculiar and\r\nHerculean labors. He had a natural and intuitive perception of\r\naffinities in language, and of its hidden relations. His researches\r\nhave thrown important light on the general principles of this science,\r\nas also on the history and character of individual languages. In\r\ndevising an alphabet of the Indian tongues in North America, since\r\nadopted in the Polynesian Islands, he rendered a brilliant service to\r\ncivilization. It is pleasant to contemplate the Scholar sending forth\r\nfrom his seclusion this priceless instrument of improvement. On the\r\ndistant islands once moistened by the blood of Cook newspapers and\r\nbooks are printed in a native language, which was reduced to a written\r\ncharacter by the care and genius of Pickering. The Vocabulary of\r\nAmericanisms and the Greek and English Lexicon attest still further the\r\nvariety and value of his philological labors; nor can we sufficiently\r\nadmire the facility with which, amidst the duties of an arduous\r\nprofession and the temptations of scholarship, he assumed the appalling\r\ntask of the lexicographer, which Scaliger compares to the labors of the\r\nanvil and the mine.\r\n\r\nThere are critics, ignorant, hasty, or supercilious, who are too apt\r\nto disparage the toils of the philologist, treating them sometimes\r\nas curious only, sometimes as trivial, or, when they enter into\r\nlexicography, as those of a harmless drudge. It might be sufficient\r\nto reply, that all exercise of the intellect promoting forgetfulness\r\nof self and the love of science ministers essentially to human\r\nimprovement. But philology may claim other suffrages. It is its\r\nprovince to aid in determining the character of words, their extraction\r\nand signification, and in other ways to guide and explain the use\r\nof language; nor is it generous, while enjoying eloquence, poetry,\r\nscience, and the many charms of literature, to withhold our gratitude\r\nfrom silent and sometimes obscure labors in illustration of that great\r\ninstrument without which all the rest is nothing.\r\n\r\nThe science of Comparative Philology, which our Scholar has\r\nillustrated, may rank with shining pursuits. It challenges a place\r\nby the side of that science which received such development from\r\nthe genius of Cuvier. The study of Comparative Anatomy has thrown\r\nunexpected light on the physical history of the animate creation; but\r\nit cannot be less interesting or important to explore the unwritten\r\nhistory of the human race in languages that have been spoken, to trace\r\ntheir pedigree, to detect their affinities,--seeking the prevailing law\r\nby which they are governed. As we comprehend these things, confusion\r\nand discord retreat, the Fraternity of Man stands confessed, and the\r\nphilologist becomes a minister at the altar of universal philanthropy.\r\nIn the study of the Past, he learns to anticipate the Future; and in\r\nsublime vision he sees, with Leibnitz, that Unity of the Human Race\r\nwhich, in the succession of ages, will find its expression in an\r\ninstrument more marvellous than the infinite Calculus,--a universal\r\nlanguage, with an alphabet of human thoughts.[163]\r\n\r\n    [163] Fontenelle, Éloge de Leibnitz: OEuvres, Tom. V. p. 493.\r\nLeibnitz, Opera, ed. Dutens, Vol. V. p. 7.\r\n\r\nAs the sun draws moisture from rill, stream, lake, and ocean, to be\r\nreturned in fertilizing shower upon the earth, so did our Scholar\r\nderive knowledge from all sources, to be diffused in beneficent\r\ninfluence upon the world. He sought it not in study only, but in\r\nconverse with men, and in experience of life. His curious essay on the\r\nPronunciation of the Ancient Greek Language was suggested by listening\r\nto Greek sailors, whom the temptations of commerce had conducted to our\r\nshores from their historic sea.\r\n\r\nSuch a character--devoted to works of wide and enduring interest, not\r\nrestricted to international lines--awakened respect and honor wherever\r\nlearning was cultivated. His name was associated with illustrious\r\nfraternities of science in foreign nations, while scholars who could\r\nnot know him face to face, by an amiable commerce of letters sought the\r\naid and sympathy of his learning. His death has broken these living\r\nlinks of fellowship; but his name, that cannot die, will continue to\r\nbind all who love knowledge and virtue to the land which was blessed by\r\nhis presence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the Scholar I pass to THE JURIST. JOSEPH STORY died in the month\r\nof September, 1845, aged sixty-six. His countenance, familiar in this\r\npresence, was always so beaming with goodness and kindness that its\r\nwithdrawal seems to lessen sensibly the brightness of the scene.\r\nWe are assembled near the seat of his favorite pursuits, among the\r\nneighbors intimate with his private virtues, close by the home hallowed\r\nby his domestic altar. These paths he often trod; and all that our eyes\r\nhere look upon seems to reflect his genial smile. His twofold official\r\nrelations with the University, his high judicial station, his higher\r\ncharacter as Jurist, invest his name with a peculiar interest, while\r\nthe unconscious kindness which he showed to all, especially the young,\r\ntouches the heart, making us rise up and call him blessed. How fondly\r\nwould the youth nurtured in jurisprudence at his feet--were such an\r\noffering, Alcestis-like, within the allotments of Providence--have\r\nprolonged their beloved master's days at the expense of their own!\r\n\r\nThe University, by the voice of his learned associate, has already\r\nrendered tribute to his name. The tribunals of justice throughout the\r\ncountry have given utterance to their solemn grief, and the funeral\r\ntorch has passed across the sea into foreign lands.\r\n\r\nHe has been heard to confess that literature was his earliest passion,\r\nwhich yielded only to a sterner summons beckoning to professional\r\nlife; and they who knew him best cannot forget that he continued to\r\nthe last fond of poetry and polite letters, and would often turn from\r\nThemis to the Muses. Nor can it be doubted that this feature, which\r\nmarks the resemblance to Selden, Somers, Mansfield, and Blackstone, in\r\nEngland, and to L'Hôpital and D'Aguesseau, in France, has added to the\r\nbrilliancy and perfection of his character as a jurist. In the history\r\nof jurisprudence it would not be easy to mention a single person\r\nwinning its highest palm who was not a scholar also.\r\n\r\nThe first hardships incident to study of the law, which perplexed\r\nthe youthful spirit of the learned Spelman, beset our Jurist with\r\ndisheartening force. Let the young remember his trial and his triumph,\r\nand be of good cheer. According to the custom of his day, while\r\nyet a student in the town of Marblehead, he undertook to read Coke\r\non Littleton, in the large folio edition, thatched over with those\r\nmanifold annotations which cause the best-trained lawyer to \"gasp and\r\nstare.\" Striving to force his way through the black-letter page, he was\r\nfilled with despair. It was but a moment. The tears poured from his\r\neyes upon the open book. Those tears were his precious baptism into the\r\nlearning of the law. From that time forth he persevered, with ardor and\r\nconfidence, from triumph to triumph.\r\n\r\nHe was elevated to the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nby the side of Marshall, at the early age of thirty-two. At the same\r\nearly age Buller--reputed the ablest judge of Westminster Hall, in the\r\nlist of those who never arrived at the honors of Chief Justice--was\r\ninduced to renounce an income larger than the salary of a judge, to\r\ntake a seat by the side of Mansfield. The parallel continues. During\r\nthe remainder of Mansfield's career on the bench, Buller was the\r\nfriend and associate upon whom he chiefly leaned; and history records\r\nthe darling desire of the venerable Chief Justice that his faithful\r\nassistant should succeed to his seat and chain of office; but these\r\nwishes, the hopes of the profession, and his own continued labors\r\nwere disregarded by a minister who seldom rewarded any but political\r\nservices,--I mean Mr. Pitt. Our brother, like Buller, was the friend\r\nand associate of a venerable chief justice, by whose side he sat for\r\nmany years; nor do I state any fact which I should not for the sake of\r\nhistory, when I add, that it was the long-cherished desire of Marshall\r\nthat Story should be his successor. It was ordered otherwise; and he\r\ncontinued a judge of the Supreme Court for the space of thirty-four\r\nyears,--a judicial life of almost unexampled length in the history of\r\nthe Common Law, and of precisely the same duration with the illustrious\r\nmagistracy of D'Aguesseau in France.\r\n\r\nAs judge, he was called to administer a most extensive jurisdiction,\r\nembracing matters which in England are so variously distributed that\r\nthey never come before any one court; and in each department he has\r\nshown himself second to none other, unless we unite with him in\r\ndeferring to Marshall as the greatest expounder of a branch peculiar\r\nto ourselves, Constitutional Law. Nor will it be easy to mention any\r\nother judge who has left behind so large a number of judgments which\r\nbelong to the first class in the literature of the law. Some excel in\r\na special branch, to which their learning and labor are directed. He\r\nexcelled in all. At home in the feudal niceties of Real Law, with its\r\ndependencies of descents, remainders, and executory devises,--also in\r\nthe ancient hair-splitting technicalities of Special Pleading,--both\r\ncreatures of an illiterate age, gloomy with black-letter and verbal\r\nsubtilties,--he was most skilful in using and expounding the rules\r\nof Evidence, the product of a more refined period of juridical\r\nhistory,--was master of the common law of Contracts, and of Commercial\r\nLaw in its wide expanse, embracing so large a part of those topics\r\nwhich concern the business of our age,--was familiar with Criminal Law,\r\nwhich he administered with the learning of a judge and the tenderness\r\nof a parent,--had compassed the whole circle of Chancery in its\r\njurisdiction and its pleadings, touching all the interests of life, and\r\nsubtilely adapting the Common Law to our own age; and he ascended with\r\nease to those less trodden heights where are extended the rich demesnes\r\nof Admiralty, the Law of Prize, and that comprehensive theme, embracing\r\nall that history, philosophy, learning, literature, human experience,\r\nand Christianity have testified,--the Law of Nations.\r\n\r\nIt was not as judge only that he served. He sought other means of\r\nillustrating the science of the law which he loved so well, and\r\nto the cares of judicial life superadded the labors of author and\r\nteacher. To this he was moved by passion for the law, by desire to\r\naid its elucidation, and by the irrepressible instinct of his nature,\r\nwhich found in incessant activity the truest repose. His was that\r\nconstitution of mind where occupation is the normal state. He was\r\npossessed by a genius for labor. Others may moil in law as constantly,\r\nbut without his loving, successful study. What he undertook he always\r\ndid with heart, soul, and mind,--not with reluctant, vain compliance,\r\nbut with his entire nature bent to the task. As in social life, so was\r\nhe in study: his heart embraced labor, as his hand grasped the hand of\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nAs teacher, he should be gratefully remembered here. He was Dane\r\nProfessor of Law in the University. By the attraction of his name\r\nstudents were drawn from remote parts of the Union, and the Law School,\r\nwhich had been a sickly branch, became the golden mistletoe of our\r\nancient oak.[164] Besides learning unsurpassed in his profession, he\r\nbrought other qualities not less important in a teacher,--goodness,\r\nbenevolence, and a willingness to teach. Only a good man can be a\r\nteacher, only a benevolent man, only a man willing to teach. He was\r\nfilled with a desire to teach. He sought to mingle his mind with\r\nthat of his pupil. To pour into the souls of the young, as into\r\ncelestial urns, the fruitful waters of knowledge, was to him a blessed\r\noffice. The kindly enthusiasm of his nature found a response. Law,\r\nsometimes supposed to be harsh and crabbed, became inviting under\r\nhis instructions. Its great principles, drawn from experience and\r\nreflection, from the rules of right and wrong, from the unsounded\r\ndepths of Christian truth, illustrated by the learning of sages and\r\nthe judgments of courts, he unfolded so as to inspire a love for their\r\nstudy,--well knowing that the knowledge we impart is trivial, compared\r\nwith that awakening of the soul under the influence of which the\r\npupil himself becomes teacher. All of knowledge we can communicate is\r\nfinite; a few pages, a few chapters, a few volumes, will embrace it;\r\nbut such an influence is of incalculable power. It is the breath of a\r\nnew life; it is another soul. Story taught as priest of the law seeking\r\nto consecrate other priests. In him the spirit spake, not with the\r\nvoice of earthly calling, but with the gentleness and self-forgetful\r\nearnestness of one pleading in behalf of justice, knowledge, happiness.\r\nHis well-loved pupils hung upon his lips, and, as they left his\r\npresence, confessed new reverence for virtue, and warmer love of\r\nknowledge for its own sake.\r\n\r\n    [164]\r\n\r\n\"Talis erat species auri frondentis opaca Ilice.\"\r\n\r\n_Æneis_, VI. 208.\r\n\r\nThe spirit which glowed in his teachings filled his life. He was, in\r\nthe truest sense, Jurist,--student and expounder of jurisprudence as\r\na science,--not merely lawyer or judge, pursuing it as an art. This\r\ndistinction, though readily perceived, is not always regarded.\r\n\r\nMembers of the profession, whether on the bench or at the bar, seldom\r\nsend their regard beyond the case directly before them. The lawyer is\r\ngenerally content with the applause of the court-house, the approbation\r\nof clients, \"fat contentions, and flowing fees.\" Infrequently does he\r\nrender voluntary service felt beyond the limited circle in which he\r\nmoves, or helping forward the landmarks of justice. The judge, in the\r\ndischarge of his duty, applies the law to the case before him. He may\r\ndo this discreetly, honorably, justly, benignly, in such wise that the\r\ncommunity who looked to him for justice shall pronounce his name with\r\ngratitude,--\r\n\r\n    \"That his bones,\r\n     When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,\r\n     May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on 'em.\"\r\n\r\nBut the function of lawyer or judge, both _practising_ law, is unlike\r\nthat of the jurist, who, whether judge or lawyer, examines every\r\nprinciple in the light of science, and, while doing justice, seeks\r\nto widen and confirm the means of justice hereafter. All ages have\r\nabounded in lawyers and judges; there is no church-yard that does not\r\ncontain their forgotten dust. But the jurist is rare. The judge passes\r\nthe sentence of the law upon the prisoner at the bar face to face; but\r\nthe jurist, invisible to mortal sight, yet speaks, as was said of the\r\nRoman Law, swaying by the reason, when he has ceased to govern by the\r\nliving voice. Such a character does not live for the present only,\r\nwhether in time or place. Ascending above its temptations, yielding\r\nneither to the love of gain nor to the seduction of ephemeral praise,\r\nhe perseveres in those serene labors which help to build the mighty\r\ndome of justice, beneath which all men are to seek shelter and peace.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to hear the complaint of lawyers and judges, as they\r\nliken themselves, in short-lived fame, to the well-graced actor, of\r\nwhom only uncertain traces remain when his voice has ceased to charm.\r\nBut they labor for the present only. How can they hope to be remembered\r\nbeyond the present? They are instruments of a temporary and perishable\r\npurpose. How can they hope for more than they render? They do nothing\r\nfor all. How can they think to be remembered beyond the operation\r\nof their labors? So far forth, in time or place, as any beneficent\r\ninfluence is felt, so far will its author be gratefully commemorated.\r\nHappy may he be, if he has done aught to connect his name with the\r\nenduring principles of justice!\r\n\r\nIn the world's history, lawgivers are among the greatest and most\r\ngodlike characters. They are reformers of nations. They are builders\r\nof human society. They are fit companions of the master poets who fill\r\nit with their melody. Man will never forget Homer, Virgil, Dante,\r\nShakespeare, Milton, Goethe,--nor those other names of creative force,\r\nMinos, Solon, Lycurgus, Numa, Justinian, St. Louis, Napoleon the\r\nlegislator. Each is too closely linked with human progress not to be\r\nalways remembered.\r\n\r\nIn their train follow the company of jurists, whose labors have the\r\nvalue without the form of legislation, and whose recorded opinions,\r\nuttered from the chair of a professor, the bench of a judge, or, it may\r\nbe, from the seclusion of private life, continue to rule the nations.\r\nHere are Papinian, Tribonian, Paulus, Gaius, ancient, time-honored\r\nmasters of the Roman Law,--Cujas, its most illustrious expounder in\r\nmodern times, of whom D'Aguesseau said, \"Cujas has spoken the language\r\nof the law better than any modern, and perhaps as well as any ancient,\"\r\nand whose renown during life, in the golden age of jurisprudence,\r\nwas such that in the public schools of Germany, when his name was\r\nmentioned, all took off their hats,--Dumoulin, kinsman of our English\r\nQueen Elizabeth, and most illustrious expounder of municipal law, one\r\nof whose books was said to have accomplished what thirty thousand\r\nsoldiers of his monarch failed to do,--Hugo Grotius, filled with all\r\nknowledge and loving all truth, author of that marvellous work, at\r\ntimes divine, at other times, alas! too much of this earth, the \"Laws\r\nof War and Peace,\"--John Selden, who against Grotius vindicated for\r\nhis country the dominion of the sea, supped with Ben Jonson at the\r\nMermaid, and became, according to contemporary judgment, the great\r\ndictator of learning to the English nation,--D'Aguesseau, who brought\r\nscholarship to jurisprudence throughout a long life elevated by justice\r\nand refined by all that character and study could bestow, awakening\r\nadmiration even at the outset, so that a retiring magistrate declared\r\nthat he should be glad to end as the young man began,--Pothier, whose\r\nprofessor's chair was kissed in reverence by pilgrims from afar, while\r\nfrom his recluse life he sent forth those treatises which enter so\r\nlargely into the invaluable codes of France,--Coke, the indefatigable,\r\npedantic, but truly learned author and judge, Mansfield, the Chrysostom\r\nof the bench, and Blackstone, the elegant commentator, who are among\r\nthe few exemplars within the boast of the English Common Law,--and,\r\ndescending to our own day, Pardessus, of France, to whom commercial\r\nand maritime law is under a larger debt, perhaps, than to any single\r\nmind,--Thibaut, of Germany, earnest and successful advocate of a just\r\nscheme for the reduction of the unwritten law to the certainty of a\r\nwritten text,--Savigny, also of Germany, renowned illustrator of the\r\nRoman Law, who is yet spared to his favorite science,--and in our own\r\ncountry one now happily among us to-day by his son,[165] James Kent,\r\nthe unquestioned living head of American jurisprudence. These are among\r\njurists. Let them not be confounded with the lawyer, bustling with\r\nforensic success, although, like Dunning, arbiter of Westminster Hall,\r\nor, like Pinkney, acknowledged chief of the American bar. The jurist\r\nis higher than the lawyer,--as Watt, who invented the steam-engine, is\r\nhigher than the journeyman who feeds its fires and pours oil upon its\r\nirritated machinery,--as Washington is more exalted than the Swiss,\r\nwho, indifferent to the cause, barters for money the vigor of his arm\r\nand the sharpness of his spear.\r\n\r\n    [165] Hon. William Kent, recently appointed Royall Professor of Law in\r\nHarvard University.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer is the honored artisan of the law. Tokens of worldly success\r\nsurround him; but his labors are on the things of to-day. His name is\r\nwritten on the sandy margin of the sounding sea, soon to be washed\r\naway by the embossed foam of the tyrannous wave. Not so is the name of\r\nthe jurist. This is inscribed on the immortal tablets of the law. The\r\nceaseless flow of ages does not wear off their indestructible front;\r\nthe hour-glass of Time refuses to measure the period of their duration.\r\n\r\nInto the company of Jurists Story has now passed, taking place, not\r\nonly in the immediate history of his country, but in the grander\r\nhistory of civilization. It was a saying of his, often uttered in the\r\nconfidence of friendship, that a man may be measured by the horizon of\r\nhis mind, whether it embraces the village, town, county, or state in\r\nwhich he lives, or the whole broad country,--ay, the world itself. In\r\nthis spirit he lived and wrought, elevating himself above the present,\r\nand always finding in jurisprudence an absorbing interest. Only a few\r\ndays before the illness ending in death, it was suggested to him, that,\r\nas he was about to retire from the bench, there were many who would\r\nbe glad to see him President. He replied at once, spontaneously, and\r\nwithout hesitation, \"that the office of President of the United States\r\nwould not tempt him from his professor's chair and from the law.\" So\r\nspoke the Jurist. As lawyer, judge, professor, he was always Jurist.\r\nWhile administering justice between parties, he sought to extract from\r\ntheir cause the elements of future justice, and to advance the science\r\nof the law. Thus his judgments have a value stamped upon them which\r\nis not restricted to the occasions when they were pronounced. Like\r\nthe gold coin of the Republic, they bear the image and superscription\r\nof sovereignty, which is recognized wherever they go, even in foreign\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nMany years ago his judgments in matters of Admiralty and Prize arrested\r\nthe attention of that famous judge and jurist, Lord Stowell; and Sir\r\nJames Mackintosh, a name emblazoned by literature and jurisprudence,\r\nsaid of them, that they were \"justly admired by all cultivators of\r\nthe Law of Nations.\"[166] He has often been cited as authority in\r\nWestminster Hall,--an English tribute to a foreign jurist almost\r\nunprecedented, as all familiar with English law will know; and the\r\nChief Justice of England made the remarkable declaration, with regard\r\nto a point on which Story differed from the Queen's Bench, that his\r\nopinion would \"at least neutralize the effect of the English decision,\r\nand induce any of their courts to consider the question as an open\r\none.\"[167] In the House of Lords, Lord Campbell characterized him\r\nas \"one of the greatest ornaments of the United States, who had a\r\ngreater reputation as a legal writer than any author England could\r\nboast since the days of Blackstone\";[168] and, in a letter to our\r\ndeparted brother, the same distinguished magistrate said: \"I survey\r\nwith increased astonishment your extensive, minute, exact, and familiar\r\nknowledge of English legal writers in every department of the law. A\r\nsimilar testimony to your juridical learning, I make no doubt, would be\r\noffered by the lawyers of France and Germany, as well as of America,\r\nand we should all concur in placing you at the head of the jurists of\r\nthe present age.\"[169] His authority was acknowledged in France and\r\nGermany, the classic lands of jurisprudence; nor is it too much to say,\r\nthat at the moment of his death he enjoyed a renown such as had never\r\nbefore been achieved, during life, by any jurist of the Common Law.\r\n\r\n    [166] Letter of Sir James Mackintosh to Hon. Edward Everett, dated June\r\n3, 1824: Life and Letters of Story, Vol. I. p. 435.\r\n\r\n    [167] Letter of Lord Denman to Charles Sumner, Esq., dated September\r\n29, 1840: Life and Letters of Story, Vol. II. p. 379. The case to which\r\nLord Denman referred was that of _Peters_ v. _The Warren Insurance\r\nCompany_, 3 Sumner's Rep. 389, where Mr. Justice Story dissented from\r\nthe case of _De Vaux_ v. _Salvador_, 4 Adolph. & Ellis, 420.\r\n\r\n    [168] Hansard, Parl. Deb., LXVIII. 667.\r\n\r\n    [169] Life and Letters of Story, Vol. II. p. 429.\r\n\r\nIn this recital I state simply facts, without intending to assert\r\npresumptuously for our brother any precedence in the scale of eminence.\r\nThe extent of his fame is a fact. It will not be forgotten, as a proper\r\ncontrast to his fame, which was not confined to his own country or to\r\nEngland, that the cultivators of the Common Law have hitherto enjoyed\r\nlittle more than an insular reputation, and that even its great master\r\nreceived on the Continent no higher designation than _quidam Cocus_,\r\n\"one Coke.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Common Law was the spirit of liberty; in that of the Continent\r\nthe spirit of science. The Common Law has given to the world trial by\r\njury, _habeas corpus_, parliamentary representation, the rules and\r\norders of debate, and that benign principle which pronounces that\r\nits air is too pure for a slave to breathe,--perhaps the five most\r\nimportant political establishments of modern times. From the Continent\r\nproceeded the important impulse to the systematic study, arrangement,\r\nand development of the law,--also the example of Law Schools and of\r\nCodes.\r\n\r\nStory was bred in the Common Law; but while admiring its vital\r\nprinciples of freedom, he felt how much it would gain from science,\r\nand from other systems of jurisprudence. In his later labors he never\r\nforgot this object; and under his hands we behold the development of a\r\nstudy until him little known or regarded,--the science of _Comparative\r\nJurisprudence_, kindred to those other departments of knowledge which\r\nexhibit the relations of the human family, and showing that amidst\r\ndiversity there is unity.\r\n\r\nI need not add that he emulated the law schools of the Continent,--as\r\n\"ever witness for him\" this seat of learning.\r\n\r\nOn more than one occasion, he urged, with conclusive force, the\r\nimportance of reducing the unwritten law to the certainty of a code,\r\ncompiling and bringing into one body fragments now scattered in all\r\ndirections, through the pages of many thousand volumes.[170] His views\r\non this subject, while differing from those of John Locke and Jeremy\r\nBentham,--both of whom supposed themselves able to clothe a people in\r\na new code, as in fresh garments,--are in substantial harmony with\r\nthe conclusions now adopted by the jurists of Continental Europe,\r\nand not unlike those of an earlier age having the authority of Bacon\r\nand Leibnitz, the two greatest intellects ever applied to topics of\r\njurisprudence in modern times.[171]\r\n\r\n    [170] Encyclopædia Americana, article _Law, Legislation, Codes_,\r\nAppendix to Vol. VII. pp. 576-592.

He loved the law\r\nwith a lover's fondness, but not with a lover's blindness. He could\r\nnot join with those devotees of the Common Law by whom it is entitled\r\n\"the perfection of reason,\"--an anachronism great as the assumed\r\ninfallibility of the Pope: as if perfection or infallibility existed\r\nin this world! He was led, in becoming temper, to contemplate its\r\namendment; and here is revealed the Jurist,--not content with the\r\npresent, but thoughtful of the future. In a letter published since\r\nhis death, he refers with sorrow to \"what is but too common in\r\nour profession,--a disposition to resist innovation, even when it\r\nis improvement.\" It is an elevated mind that, having mastered the\r\nsubtilties of the law, is willing to reform them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now farewell to thee, Jurist, Master, Benefactor, Friend! May thy\r\nspirit continue to inspire a love for the science of the law! May thy\r\nexample be ever fresh in the minds of the young, beaming, as in life,\r\nwith encouragement, kindness, and joy!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the grave of the Jurist, at Mount Auburn, let us walk to that\r\nof THE ARTIST, who sleeps beneath the protecting arms of those trees\r\nwhich cast their shadow into this church. WASHINGTON ALLSTON died in\r\nthe month of July, 1843, aged sixty-three, having reached the grand\r\nclimacteric, that famous mile-stone on the road of life. It was\r\nSaturday night; the cares of the week were over; the pencil and brush\r\nwere laid in repose; the great canvas, on which for many years he had\r\nsought to perpetuate the image of Daniel confronting the soothsayers\r\nof Belshazzar, was left, with fresh chalk lines designating the labor\r\nto be resumed after the repose of the Sabbath; the evening was passed\r\nin the converse of family and friends; words of benediction had fallen\r\nfrom his lips upon a beloved relative; all had retired for the night,\r\nleaving him alone, in health, to receive the visitation of Death,\r\nsudden, but not unprepared for. Happy lot, thus to be borne away\r\nwith blessings on the lips,--not through the long valley of disease,\r\namidst the sharpness of pain, and the darkness that clouds the slowly\r\ndeparting spirit, but straight upward, through realms of light,\r\nswiftly, yet gently, as on the wings of a dove!\r\n\r\nThe early shades of evening began to prevail before the body of the\r\nArtist reached its last resting-place; and the solemn service of\r\nthe church was read in the open air, by the flickering flame of a\r\ntorch,--fit image of life. In the group of mourners who bore a last\r\ntribute to what was mortal in him of whom so much was immortal stood\r\nour Jurist. Overflowing with tenderness and appreciation of merit in\r\nall its forms, his soul was touched by the scene. In vivid words, as\r\nhe slowly left the church-yard, he poured forth his admiration and his\r\ngrief. Never was such an Artist mourned by such a Jurist.\r\n\r\nOf Allston may we repeat the words in which Burke commemorated his\r\nfriend Sir Joshua Reynolds, when he says, \"He was the first who\r\nadded the praise of the elegant arts to the other glories of his\r\ncountry.\"[172] An ingenious English writer, who sees Art with the eye\r\nof taste and humanity, and whom I quote with sympathy, if not with\r\nentire assent, has said, in a recent publication on our Artist, \"It\r\nseemed to me that in him America had lost her third great man. What\r\nWashington was as a statesman, Channing as a moralist, _that_ was\r\nAllston as an artist.\"[173]\r\n\r\n    [172] Prior, Life of Burke, Vol. II. p. 190.\r\n\r\n    [173] Mrs. Jameson, Memoirs and Essays: _Washington Allston_, p. 126.\r\n(New York, 1846.)\r\n\r\nHere again is discerned the inseparable union between character\r\nand works. Allston was a good man, with a soul refined by purity,\r\nexalted by religion, softened by love. In manner he was simple, yet\r\ncourtly,--quiet, though anxious to please,--kindly to all alike, the\r\npoor and lowly not less than the rich and great. As he spoke, in that\r\nvoice of gentlest utterance, all were charmed to listen; and the\r\nairy-footed hours often tripped on far towards the gates of morning,\r\nbefore his friends could break from his spell. His character is\r\ntransfigured in his works. The Artist is always inspired by the man.\r\n\r\nHis life was consecrated to Art. He lived to diffuse Beauty, as\r\nwriter, poet, painter. As an expounder of principles in his art, he\r\nwill take a place with Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Dürer, Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds, and Fuseli. His theory of painting, as developed in his still\r\nunpublished discourses, and in that tale of beauty, \"Monaldi,\" is an\r\ninstructive memorial of conscientious study. In the small group of\r\npainter-poets--poets by the double title of pencil and pen--he holds an\r\nhonored place. His ode \"America to Great Britain,\" which is among the\r\nchoice lyrics of the language, is superior to the satirical verse of\r\nSalvator Rosa, and may claim companionship with the remarkable sonnets\r\nof Michel Angelo. It was this which made no less a judge than Southey\r\nplace him among the first poets of the age.\r\n\r\nIn youth, while yet a pupil at the University, his busy fingers\r\nfound pleasure in drawing; and a pen-and-ink sketch from his hand at\r\nthat time is still preserved in the records of a college society.\r\nShortly after leaving Cambridge he repaired to Europe, in the pursuit\r\nof Art. At Paris were then collected the masterpieces of painting\r\nand sculpture, the spoils of unholy war, robbed from their native\r\ngalleries and churches to swell the pomp of the Imperial capital.\r\nThere our Artist devoted his days to diligent study of his profession,\r\nparticularly to drawing, so important to accurate art. At a later\r\nday, alluding to these thorough labors, he said he \"worked like a\r\nmechanic.\" To these, perhaps, may be referred his singular excellence\r\nin that necessary, but neglected branch, which is to Art what grammar\r\nis to language. Grammar and Design are treated by Aristotle on a level.\r\n\r\nTurning his back upon Paris and the greatness of the Empire, he\r\ndirected his steps towards Italy, the enchanted ground of literature,\r\nhistory, and art,--strown with richest memorials of the Past,--filled\r\nwith scenes memorable in the Progress of Man,--teaching by the\r\npages of philosophers and historians,--vocal with the melody of\r\npoets,--ringing with the music which St. Cecilia protects,--glowing\r\nwith the living marble and canvas,--beneath a sky of heavenly purity\r\nand brightness,--with the sunsets which Claude has painted,--parted\r\nby the Apennines, early witnesses of the unrecorded Etruscan\r\ncivilization,--surrounded by the snow-capped Alps, and the blue,\r\nclassic waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The deluge of war submerging\r\nEurope had subsided here, and our Artist took up his peaceful abode in\r\nRome, the modern home of Art. Strange vicissitude of condition! Rome,\r\nsole surviving city of Antiquity, once disdaining all that could be\r\nwrought by the cunning hand of sculpture,--\r\n\r\n    \"Excudent alii spirantia mollius æra,\r\n     Credo equidem: vivos ducent de marmore vultus,\"--\r\n\r\nwho has commanded the world by her arms, her jurisprudence, her\r\nchurch,--now sways it further by her arts. Pilgrims from afar, where\r\nher eagles, her prætors, her interdicts never reached, become willing\r\nsubjects of this new empire; and the Vatican, stored with the priceless\r\nremains of Antiquity, and the touching creations of modern art, has\r\nsucceeded to the Vatican whose thunders intermingled with the strifes\r\nof modern Europe.\r\n\r\nAt Rome he was happy in the friendship of Coleridge, and in long walks\r\ncheered by his companionship. We can well imagine that the author\r\nof \"Genevieve\" and \"The Ancient Mariner\" would find sympathy with\r\nAllston. It is easy to recall these two natures, tremblingly alive\r\nto beauty of all kinds, looking together upon those majestic ruins,\r\nupon the manifold accumulations of Time, upon the marble which almost\r\nspeaks, and upon the warmer canvas,--listening together to the flow\r\nof perpetual fountains, fed by ancient aqueducts,--musing together in\r\nthe Forum on the mighty footprints of History,--and entering together,\r\nwith sympathetic awe, that grand Christian church whose dome rises a\r\nmajestic symbol of the comprehensive Christianity which is the promise\r\nof the Future. \"Never judge a work of art by its defects,\" was a\r\nlesson of Coleridge to his companion, which, when extended, by natural\r\nexpansion, to the other things of life, is a sentiment of justice and\r\ncharity, more precious than a statue of Praxiteles or a picture of\r\nRaphael.\r\n\r\nIn England, where our Artist afterwards passed several years, his\r\nintercourse with Coleridge was renewed, and he became the friend and\r\ncompanion of Lamb and Wordsworth also. Returning to his own country,\r\nhe spoke of them with fondness, and often dwelt upon their genius and\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nIn considering his character as an Artist, we may regard him in three\r\ndifferent respects,--drawing, color, and expression or sentiment. It\r\nhas already been seen that he devoted himself with uncommon zeal to\r\ndrawing. His works bear witness to this excellence. There are chalk\r\noutlines by him, sketched on canvas, which are clear and definite as\r\nanything from the classic touch of Flaxman.\r\n\r\nHis excellence in color was remarkable. This seeming mystery,\r\nwhich is a distinguishing characteristic of artists in different\r\nschools, periods, and countries, is not unlike that of language in\r\nliterature. Color is to the painter what words are to the author;\r\nand as the writers of one age or place arrive at a peculiar mastery\r\nin language, so do artists excel in color. It would be difficult to\r\naccount satisfactorily for the rich idiom suddenly assumed by our\r\nEnglish tongue in the contemporaneous prose of Sidney, Hooker, and\r\nBacon, and in the unapproached affluence of Shakespeare. It might be\r\nas difficult to account for the unequalled tints which shone on the\r\ncanvas of Tintoretto, Paul Veronese, and Titian, masters of what is\r\ncalled the Venetian School. Ignorance has sometimes referred these\r\nglories to concealed or lost artistic rules in combinations of color,\r\nnot thinking that they can be traced only to a native talent for\r\ncolor, prompted into activity by circumstances difficult at this late\r\nperiod to determine. As some possess a peculiar, untaught felicity and\r\ncopiousness of words without accurate knowledge of grammar, so there\r\nare artists excelling in rich and splendid color, but ignorant of\r\ndrawing, and, on the other hand, accurate drawing is sometimes coldly\r\nclad in unsatisfactory color.\r\n\r\nAllston was largely endowed by Nature with the talent for color, which\r\nwas strongly developed under the influence of Italian art. While in\r\nRome, he was remarked for his excellence in this respect, and received\r\nfrom German painters there the flattering title of \"American Titian.\"\r\nCritics of authority have said that the clearness and vigor of his\r\ncolor approached that of the elder masters.[174] Rich and harmonious\r\nas the verses of the \"Faëry Queen,\" it was uniformly soft, mellow, and\r\nappropriate, without the garish brilliancy of the modern French School,\r\ncalling to mind the saying of the blind man, that red resembles the\r\nnotes of a trumpet.\r\n\r\n    [174] Bunsen, Beschreibung der Stadt Rom, Band I. p. 588. Article on\r\n_Modern Art_, by K. Platner.\r\n\r\nHe affected no secret or mystery in the preparation of colors. What\r\nhe knew he was ready to impart: his genius he could not impart. With\r\nsimple pigments, accessible to all alike, he reproduced, with glowing\r\nbrush, the tints of Nature. All that his eyes looked upon furnished\r\na lesson. The flowers of the field, the foliage of the forest, the\r\nsunset glories of our western horizon, the transparent azure above,\r\nthe blackness of the storm, the soft gray of twilight, the haze of an\r\nIndian summer, the human countenance animate with thought, and that\r\nfinest color in Nature, according to the ancient Greek, the blush of\r\ningenuous youth,--these were the sources from which he drew. With a\r\ndiscerning spirit he mixed them on his palette, and with the eye of\r\nsympathy saw them again on his canvas.\r\n\r\nBut richness of color superadded to accuracy of drawing cannot secure\r\nthe highest place in Art; and here I approach a more harmonious\r\ntopic. Expression, or, in other words, the sentiment, the thought,\r\nthe soul, which inspires the work, is not less important than that\r\nwhich animates the printed page or beams from the human countenance.\r\nThe mere imitation of inanimate Nature belongs to the humbler schools\r\nof Art. The skill of Zeuxis, which drew birds to peck at the grapes\r\non his canvas, and the triumph of Parrhasius, who deceived his rival\r\nby a painted curtain, cannot compare with those pictures which seem\r\narticulate with the voices of humanity. The highest form of Art is that\r\nwhich represents man in the highest scenes and under the influence\r\nof the highest sentiments. And that quality or characteristic called\r\n_expression_ is the highest element of Art. It is this which gives to\r\nRaphael, who yields to Titian in color, such acknowledged eminence. His\r\nsoul was brimming with sympathies, which his cunning hand kept alive\r\nin immortal pictures. Eye, mouth, countenance, the whole composition,\r\nhas life,--not the life of mere imitation, copied from common Nature,\r\nbut elevated, softened, refined, idealized. Beholding his works, we\r\nforget the colors in which they are robed; we gaze at living forms, and\r\nlook behind the painted screen of flesh into living souls. A genius so\r\nlargely endowed with the Promethean fire has been not unaptly called\r\nDivine.\r\n\r\nIt was said by Plato that nothing is beautiful which is not morally\r\ngood. But this is not a faultless proposition. Beauty is of all kinds\r\nand degrees; and it exists everywhere beneath the celestial canopy, in\r\nus and about us. It is that completeness or finish which gives pleasure\r\nto the mind. It is found in the color of a flower, and the accuracy of\r\ngeometry,--in an act of self-sacrifice, and the rhythm of a poem,--in\r\nthe virtues of humanity, and the marvels of the visible world,--in the\r\nmeditations of a solitary soul, and the stupendous mechanism of civil\r\nsociety. There is beauty where there is neither life nor morality; but\r\nthe highest form of beauty is in the perfection of the moral nature.\r\n\r\nThe highest beauty of expression is a grace of Christian art. It\r\nflows from sensibilities, affections, and struggles peculiar to\r\nthe Christian character. It breathes purity, gentleness, meekness,\r\npatience, tenderness, peace. It abhors pride, vain-glory, selfishness,\r\nintemperance, lust, war. How celestial, compared with that which dwells\r\nin perfection of form or color only! The beauty of ancient art found\r\ncongenial expression in the faultless form of Aphrodite rising from\r\nthe sea,[175] and in the majestic mien of Juno, with snow-white arms,\r\nand royal robes, seated on a throne of gold,[176]--not in the soul-lit\r\ncountenance of her who watched the infant in his manger-cradle, and\r\nthrobbed with a mother's heart beneath the agonies of the cross.\r\n\r\n    [175] Ovid, Tristia, Lib. II. 527.\r\n\r\n    [176] Martial, Epig., Lib. X. 89.\r\n\r\nAllston was a Christian artist; and the beauty of expression\r\nlends uncommon charm to his colors. All that he did shows purity,\r\nsensibility, refinement, delicacy, feeling, rather than force. His\r\ngenius was almost feminine. As he advanced in years, this was more\r\nremarked. His pictures became more and more instinct with those\r\nsentiments which form the true glory of Art. Early in life he had a\r\npartiality for pieces representing _banditti_; but this taste does not\r\nappear in his later works. And when asked if he would undertake to\r\nfill the vacant panels in the rotunda of the Capitol at Washington,\r\nshould Congress determine to order such a work, he is reported to have\r\nsaid, in memorable words, \"I will paint only one subject, and choose\r\nmy own: _No battle-piece!_\"[177] This incident, so honorable to the\r\nArtist, is questioned; but it is certain that on more than one occasion\r\nhe avowed a disinclination to paint _battle-pieces_. I am not aware\r\nif he assigned any reason. Is it too much to suppose that his refined\r\nartistic sense, recognizing expression as the highest beauty of Art,\r\nunconsciously judged the picture? The ancient Greek epigram, describing\r\nthe Philoctetes of Parrhasius, an image of hopeless wretchedness and\r\nconsuming grief, rises to a like sentiment, when it says, with mild\r\nrebuke,--\r\n\r\n    \"We blame thee, painter, though thy skill commend;\r\n    'Twas time his sufferings with himself should end.\"[178]\r\n\r\n    [177] Dunlap's History of the Arts of Design, Vol. II. p. 188. Mrs.\r\nJameson's Memoirs and Essays: _Washington Allston_, p. 114.\r\n\r\n    [178] Anthol. Lib. IV. Tit. viii. Ep. 26.\r\n\r\nIn another tone, and with cold indifference to human suffering,\r\nLucretius sings, in often-quoted verse, that it is pleasant, when\r\nbeyond the reach of danger, to behold the shock of contending armies:--\r\n\r\n    \"Suave etiam belli certamina magna tueri.\"[179]\r\n\r\n    [179] Lucretius, De Rerum Natura, Lib. II. 6.\r\n\r\nIn like heathen spirit, it may be pleasant to behold a _battle-piece_\r\nin Art. But this is wrong. Admitting the calamitous necessity of\r\nwar, it can never be with pleasure--it cannot be without sadness\r\nunspeakable--that we survey its fiendish encounter. The artist of\r\npurest aim, sensitive to these emotions, withdraws naturally from the\r\nfield of blood, confessing that no scene of battle finds a place in\r\nthe highest Art,--that man, created in the image of God, can never be\r\npictured degrading, profaning, violating that sacred image.\r\n\r\nWere this sentiment adopted in literature as in Art, war would be shorn\r\nof its false glory. Poet, historian, orator, all should join with the\r\nArtist in saying, _No battle-piece!_ Let them cease to dwell, except\r\nwith pain and reprobation, upon those dismal exhibitions of human\r\npassion where the life of friends is devoted to procure the death\r\nof enemies. No pen, no tongue, no pencil, by praise or picture, can\r\ndignify scenes from which God averts His eye. It is true, man has slain\r\nhis fellow-man, armies have rushed in deadly shock against armies,\r\nthe blood of brothers has been spilled. These are tragedies which\r\nHistory enters sorrowfully, tearfully, in her faithful record; but\r\nthis generous Muse with too attractive colors must not perpetuate the\r\npassions from which they sprang or the griefs they caused. Be it her\r\nduty to dwell with eulogy and pride on all that is magnanimous, lovely,\r\nbeneficent; let this be preserved by votive canvas and marble also. But\r\n_No battle-piece!_\r\n\r\nIn the progress of truth, the animal passions degrading our nature are\r\nby degrees checked and subdued. The license of lust and the brutality\r\nof intemperance, marking a civilization inferior to our own, are at\r\nlast driven from public display. Faithful Art reflects the character\r\nof the age. To its honor, libertinism and intemperance no longer\r\nintrude their obscene faces into its pictures. The time is at hand\r\nwhen religion, humanity, and taste will concur in rejecting any image\r\nof human strife. Laïs and Phryne have fled; Bacchus and Silenus are\r\ndriven reeling from the scene. Mars will soon follow, howling, as with\r\nthat wound from the Grecian spear before Troy. The Hall of Battles,\r\nat Versailles, where Louis Philippe, the inconsistent conservator of\r\npeace, has arrayed, on acres of canvas, the bloody contests in the\r\nlong history of France, will be shut by a generation appreciating true\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nIn the mission of teaching to nations and to individuals wherein is\r\ntrue greatness, Art has a noble office. If not herald, she is at least\r\nhandmaid of Truth. Her lessons may not train the intellect, but they\r\ncannot fail to touch the heart. Who can measure the influence from\r\nan image of beauty, affection, and truth? The Christus Consolator of\r\nScheffer, without a word, wins the soul. Such a work awakens lasting\r\nhomage to the artist, and to the spirit from which it proceeds, while\r\nit takes its place with things that never die. Other works, springing\r\nfrom the lower passions, are no better than gaudy, perishing flowers of\r\nearth; but here is perennial, amaranthine bloom.\r\n\r\nAllston loved excellence for its own sake. He looked down upon the\r\ncommon strife for worldly consideration. With impressive beauty\r\nof truth and expression, he said, \"Fame is the eternal shadow of\r\nexcellence, from which it can never be separated.\"[180] Here is a\r\nvolume, prompting to noble thought and action, not for the sake of\r\nglory, but for advance in knowledge, virtue, excellence. Our Artist\r\ngives renewed utterance to that sentiment which is the highest grace in\r\nthe life of the great magistrate, Lord Mansfield, when, confessing the\r\nattractions of \"popularity,\" he said it was that which followed, not\r\nwhich was followed after.\r\n\r\n    [180] Mrs. Jameson, Memoirs and Essays: _Washington Allston_, p. 118.\r\n\r\nAs we contemplate the life and works of Allston, we are inexpressibly\r\ngrateful that he lived. His example is one of our best possessions. And\r\nyet, while rejoicing that he has done much, we seem to hear a whisper\r\nthat he might have done more. His productions suggest a higher genius\r\nthan they display; and we are disposed sometimes to praise the master\r\nrather than the work. Like a beloved character in English literature,\r\nSir James Mackintosh, he finally closed a career of beautiful, but\r\nfragmentary labors, leaving much undone which all had hoped he would\r\ndo. The great painting which haunted so many years of his life, and\r\nwhich his friends and country awaited with anxious interest, remained\r\nunfinished at last. His Virgilian sensibility and modesty would\r\ndoubtless have ordered its destruction, had death arrested him less\r\nsuddenly. Titian died, leaving incomplete, like Allston, an important\r\npicture, on which his hand was busy down to the time of his death. A\r\npious and distinguished pupil, the younger Palma, took up the labor\r\nof his master, and, on its completion, placed it in the church for\r\nwhich it was destined, with this inscription: \"That which Titian left\r\nunfinished Palma reverently completed, and dedicated to God.\" Where is\r\nthe Palma who can complete what our Titian has left unfinished?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us now devoutly approach the grave of the brother whom, in order\r\nof time, we were first called to mourn. WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING, THE\r\nPHILANTHROPIST, died in the month of October, 1842, aged sixty-two.\r\nBy an easy transition we pass from Allston to Channing. They were\r\nfriends and connections. The monumental stone which marks the last\r\nresting-place of the Philanthropist was designed by the Artist. In\r\nphysical organization they were not unlike, each possessing a fineness\r\nof fibre hardly belonging to the Anglo-Saxon stock. In both we observe\r\nsimilar sensibility, delicacy, refinement, and truth, with highest\r\naims; and the color of Allston finds a parallel in the Venetian\r\nrichness which marks the style of Channing.\r\n\r\nI do not speak of him as Theologian, although his labors have earned\r\nthis title also. It is probable that no single mind, in our age, has\r\nexerted a greater influence over theological opinions. But I pass all\r\nthis by, without presuming to indicate its character. Far better dwell\r\non those labors which should not fail to find favor in all churches,\r\nwhether at Rome, Geneva, Canterbury, or Boston.\r\n\r\nHis influence is widely felt and acknowledged. His words have been\r\nheard and read by thousands, in all conditions of life, and in various\r\nlands, whose hearts now throb with gratitude towards the meek and\r\neloquent upholder of divine truth. An American traveller, at a small\r\nvillage nestling on a terrace of the Tyrolese Alps, encountered a\r\nGerman, who, hearing that his companion was from Boston, inquired\r\nearnestly after Channing,--saying that the difficulty of learning\r\nthe English language was adequately repaid by the charm of his\r\nwritings. A distinguished stranger, when about to visit our country,\r\nwas told by a relative not less lovely in character than elevated in\r\ncondition, that she envied him his journey \"for the sake of Niagara and\r\nChanning.\" We have already observed that a critic of Art places him in\r\nan American triumvirate with Allston and Washington. More frequently\r\nhe is associated with Washington and Franklin. Unlike Washington, he\r\nwas never general or president; unlike Franklin, he never held high\r\noffice. But it would be difficult to say that since them any American\r\nhas exerted greater sway over his fellow-men. And yet, if it be asked\r\nwhat single measure he carried to a successful close, I could not\r\nanswer. It is on _character_ that he has wrought and is still producing\r\nincalculable change. So extensive is this influence, that multitudes\r\nnow feel it, although strangers to his spoken or even his written word.\r\nThe whole country and age feel it.\r\n\r\nI have called him Philanthropist, lover of man,--the title of highest\r\nhonor on earth. \"I take goodness in this sense,\" says Lord Bacon, in\r\nhis Essays, \"_the affecting of the weal of men_, which is that the\r\nGrecians call _Philanthropia_.... This of all virtues and dignities\r\nof the mind is the greatest, being the character of the Deity; and\r\nwithout it man is a busy, mischievous, wretched thing, no better than\r\na kind of vermin.\" Lord Bacon was right. Confessing the attractions of\r\nscholarship, awed by the majesty of the law, fascinated by the beauty\r\nof Art, the soul bends with involuntary reverence before the angelic\r\nnature that seeks the good of his fellow-man. Through him God speaks.\r\nOn him has descended in especial measure the Divine Spirit. God is\r\nLove; and man, when most active in good works, most nearly resembles\r\nHim. In heaven, we are told, the first place or degree is given to the\r\nangels of love, who are termed Seraphim,--the second to the angels of\r\nlight, who are termed Cherubim.\r\n\r\nSorrowfully it must be confessed that the time has not come when even\r\nhis exalted labors find equal acceptance with all men. And now, as\r\nI undertake to speak of them in this presence, I seem to tread on\r\nhalf-buried cinders. I shall tread fearlessly, loyal ever, I hope, to\r\nthe occasion, to my subject, and to myself. In the language of my own\r\nprofession, I shall not travel out of the record; but I must be true\r\nto the record. It is fit that his name should be commemorated here.\r\nHe was one of us. He was a son of the University, enrolled also among\r\nits teachers, and for many years a Fellow of the Corporation. To him,\r\nmore, perhaps, than to any other person, is she indebted for her most\r\ndistinctive opinions. His fame is indissolubly connected with hers:--\r\n\r\n    \"And when thy ruins shall disclaim\r\n     To be the treasurer of his name,\r\n     His name, that cannot die, shall be\r\n     An everlasting monument to thee.\"[181]\r\n\r\n    [181] Ben Jonson's inscription for the \"pious marble\" in honor of\r\nDrayton.\r\n\r\nI have called him Philanthropist: he may also be called Moralist, for\r\nhe was the expounder of human duties; but his exposition of duties\r\nwas another service to humanity. His morality, elevated by Christian\r\nlove, fortified by Christian righteousness, was frankly applied to the\r\npeople and affairs of his own country and age. He saw full well, that,\r\nin contest with wrong, more was needed than a declaration of simple\r\nprinciples. A general morality is too vague for action. Tamerlane\r\nand Napoleon both might join in general praise of peace, and entitle\r\nthemselves to be enrolled, with Alexander of Russia, as members of a\r\nPeace Society. Many satisfy the conscience by such generalities. This\r\nwas not the case with our Philanthropist. He brought his morality\r\nto bear distinctly upon the world. Nor was he disturbed by another\r\nsuggestion, which the moralist often encounters, that his views\r\nwere sound in theory, but not practical. He well knew that what is\r\nunsound in theory must be vicious in practice. Undisturbed by hostile\r\ncriticism, he did not hesitate to arraign the wrong he discerned, and\r\nfasten upon it the mark of Cain. His philanthropy was morality in\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAs a moralist, he knew that the truest happiness is reached only\r\nby following the Right; and as a lover of man, he sought on all\r\noccasions to inculcate this supreme duty, which he addressed to nations\r\nand individuals alike. In this attempt to open the gates of a new\r\ncivilization, he encountered prejudice and error. The principles of\r\nmorality, first possessing the individual, slowly pervade the body\r\npolitic; and we are often told, in extenuation of war and conquest,\r\nthat the nation and the individual are governed by separate laws,--that\r\nthe nation may do what an individual may not do. In combating this\r\npernicious fallacy, Channing was a benefactor. He helped to bring\r\ngovernment within the Christian circle, and taught the statesman\r\nthat there is one comprehensive rule, binding on the conscience in\r\npublic affairs, as in private affairs. This truth cannot be too often\r\nproclaimed. Pulpit, press, school, college, all should render it\r\nfamiliar to the ear, and pour it into the soul. Beneficent Nature\r\njoins with the moralist in declaring the universality of God's law;\r\nthe flowers of the field, the rays of the sun, the morning and evening\r\ndews, the descending showers, the waves of the sea, the breezes\r\nthat fan our cheeks and bear rich argosies from shore to shore, the\r\ncareering storm, all on this earth,--nay, more, the system of which\r\nthis earth is a part, and the infinitude of the Universe, in which our\r\nsystem dwindles to a grain of sand, all declare one prevailing law,\r\nknowing no distinction of person, number, mass, or extent.\r\n\r\nWhile Channing commended this truth, he fervently recognized the\r\nRights of Man. He saw in our institutions, as established in 1776, the\r\nanimating idea of Human Rights, distinguishing us from other countries.\r\nIt was this idea, which, first appearing at our nativity as a nation,\r\nshone on the path of our fathers, as the unaccustomed star in the west\r\nwhich twinkled over Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nKindred to the idea of Human Rights was that other, which appears\r\nso often in his writings as to inspire his whole philanthropy,\r\nthe importance of the Individual Man. No human soul so abject in\r\ncondition as not to find sympathy and reverence from him. He confessed\r\nbrotherhood with all God's children, although separated from them by\r\nrivers, mountains, and seas,--although a torrid sun had left upon\r\nthem an unchangeable Ethiopian skin. Filled with this thought, he was\r\nuntiring in effort to promote their elevation and happiness. He yearned\r\nto do good, to be a spring of life and light to his fellow-men. \"I\r\nsee nothing worth living for,\" he said, \"but the divine virtue which\r\nendures and surrenders all things for truth, duty, and mankind.\" In\r\nthis spirit, so long as he lived, he was the constant champion of\r\nHumanity.\r\n\r\nIn the cause of education and of temperance he was earnest. He saw how\r\nessential to a people governing themselves was knowledge,--that without\r\nit the right of voting would be a dangerous privilege, and that with\r\nit the nation would be elevated with new means of happiness and power.\r\nHis vivid imagination saw the blight of intemperance, and exposed it\r\nin glowing colors. In these efforts he was sustained by the kindly\r\nsympathy of those among whom he lived.\r\n\r\nThere were two other causes in which, more than any other, his soul was\r\nenlisted, especially toward the close of life, and with which his name\r\nwill be inseparably associated,--I mean the efforts for the abolition\r\nof those two terrible scourges, Slavery and War.\r\n\r\nAll will see that I cannot pass these by on this occasion; for not\r\nto speak of them would be to present a portrait in which the most\r\ndistinctive features were wanting.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, as to Slavery. To this his attention was particularly\r\ndrawn by early residence in Virginia, and a season subsequently in one\r\nof the West India Islands. His soul was moved by its injustice and\r\ninhumanity. He saw in it an infraction of God's great laws of Right\r\nand Love, and of the Christian precept, \"Whatsoever ye would that men\r\nshould do to you, do ye even so to them.\" Regarding it contrary to the\r\nlaw of Nature, the Philanthropist unconsciously adopted the conclusions\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States, speaking by the mouth of\r\nChief Justice Marshall,[182] and of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts,\r\nat a later day, speaking by the mouth of Chief Justice Shaw. A solemn\r\ndecision, now belonging to the jurisprudence of this Commonwealth,\r\ndeclares that \"slavery is contrary to natural right, to the principles\r\nof justice, humanity, and sound policy.\"[183]\r\n\r\n    [182] The Antelope, 10 Wheaton's Rep. 211.\r\n\r\n    [183] Commonwealth _v._ Aves, 18 Pick. 211.\r\n\r\nWith these convictions, his duty as Moralist and Philanthropist did not\r\nadmit of question. He saw before him a giant wrong. Almost alone he\r\nwent forth to the contest. On his return from the West Indies, he first\r\ndeclared himself from the pulpit. At a later day, he published a book\r\nentitled \"Slavery,\" the most considerable treatise from his pen. His\r\nobject, as he testifies, was \"to oppose slavery on principles which, if\r\nadmitted, would inspire resistance to all the wrongs and reverence for\r\nall the rights of human nature.\"[184] Other publications followed down\r\nto the close of his life, among which was a prophetic letter, addressed\r\nto Henry Clay, against the annexation of Texas, on the ground that\r\nit would entail war with Mexico and the extension of slavery. It is\r\ninteresting to know that this letter, before its publication, was read\r\nto his classmate Story, who listened to it with admiration and assent;\r\nso that the Jurist and the Philanthropist joined in this cause.\r\n\r\n    [184] Letter to Blanco White, July 29, 1836: Life of White, Vol. II. p.\r\n251.\r\n\r\nIn his defence of African liberty he invoked always the unanswerable\r\nconsiderations of justice and humanity. The argument of economy, deemed\r\nby some to contain all that is pertinent, never presented itself to\r\nhim. The question of profit and loss was absorbed in the question\r\nof right and wrong. His maxim was,--Anything but slavery; poverty\r\nsooner than slavery. But while exhibiting this institution in blackest\r\ncolors, as inhuman, unjust, unchristian, unworthy of an enlightened\r\nage and of a republic professing freedom, his gentle nature found no\r\nword of harshness for those whom birth, education, and custom bred\r\nto its support. Implacable towards wrong, he used mild words towards\r\nwrong-doers. He looked forward to the day when they too, encompassed by\r\na _moral blockade_, invisible to the eye, but more potent than navies,\r\nand under the influence of increasing light, diffused from all the\r\nnations, must acknowledge the wrong, and set the captive free.\r\n\r\nHe urged the _duty_--such was his unequivocal language--incumbent on\r\nthe Northern States to free themselves from all support of slavery. To\r\nthis conclusion he was driven irresistibly by the ethical principle,\r\nthat _what is wrong for the individual is wrong for the state_. No son\r\nof the Pilgrims can hold a fellow-man in bondage. Conscience forbids.\r\nNo son of the Pilgrims can, through Government, hold a fellow-man\r\nin bondage. Conscience equally forbids. We have among us to-day a\r\nbrother who, reducing to practice the teachings of Channing and the\r\nsuggestions of his own soul, has liberated the slaves which fell to\r\nhim by inheritance. Our homage to this act attests the obligation upon\r\nourselves. In asking the Free States to disconnect themselves from all\r\nsupport of slavery, Channing called them to do as _States_ what PALFREY\r\nhas done as _man_. At the same time he dwelt with affectionate care\r\nupon the Union. He sought to reform, not to destroy,--to eradicate,\r\nnot to overturn; and he cherished the Union as mother of peace,\r\nplenteousness, and joy.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of his labors for liberty. The mind instinctively\r\nrecalls the parallel exertions of John Milton. He, too, was a defender\r\nof liberty. His \"Defence of the People of England\" drew to him, living,\r\na larger fame than his sublime epic. But Channing's labors were of\r\na higher order, more instinct with Christian sentiment, more truly\r\nworthy of renown. Milton's _Defensio pro Populo Anglicano_ was for the\r\n_political_ freedom of the English people, supposed at that time to\r\nnumber four and a half millions. It was written after the \"bawble\" of\r\nroyalty had been removed, and in the confidence that the good cause was\r\ntriumphantly established, beneath the protecting genius of Cromwell.\r\nChanning's _Defensio pro Populo Africano_ was for the _personal_\r\nfreedom of three million fellow-men in abject bondage, none of whom\r\nknew that his eloquent pen was pleading their cause. The efforts of\r\nMilton produced his blindness; those of Channing exposed him to obloquy\r\nand calumny. How justly might the Philanthropist have borrowed the\r\nexalted words of the Sonnet to Cyriac Skinner!--\r\n\r\n        \"What supports me, dost thou ask?\r\n    The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied\r\n   _In liberty's defence, my noble task,\r\n    Of which all Europe rings from side to side_.\"\r\n\r\nThe same spirit of justice and humanity animating him in defence of\r\nliberty inspired his exertions for the abolition of the barbarous\r\ncustom or institution of War. When I call war an institution, I mean\r\ninternational war, sanctioned, explained, and defined by the Law of\r\nNations, as a mode of determining questions of right. I mean war, the\r\narbiter and umpire, the Ordeal by Battle, deliberately continued in an\r\nage of civilization, as the means of justice between nations. Slavery\r\nis an institution sustained by municipal law. War is an institution\r\nsustained by the Law of Nations. Both are relics of the early ages, and\r\nare rooted in violence and wrong.\r\n\r\nThe principle, already considered, that nations and individuals are\r\nbound by one and the same rule, applies here with unmistakable force.\r\nThe Trial by Battle, to which individuals once appealed for justice, is\r\nbranded by our civilization as _monstrous_ and _impious_; nor can we\r\nrecognize honor in the successful combatant. Christianity turns from\r\nthese scenes, as abhorrent to her best injunctions. And is it right in\r\nnations to prolong a usage, monstrous and impious in individuals? There\r\ncan be but one answer.\r\n\r\nThis definition leaves undisturbed that question of Christian ethics,\r\nwhether the right of self-defence is consistent with the example\r\nand teaching of Christ. Channing thought it was. It is sufficient\r\nthat war, when regarded as a judicial combat, sanctioned by the Law\r\nof Nations as an _institution_ to determine justice, raises no such\r\nquestion, involves no such right. When, in our age, two nations,\r\nparties to existing international law, after mutual preparations,\r\ncontinued perhaps through years, appeal to war and invoke the God\r\nof Battles, they _voluntarily_ adopt this unchristian umpirage; nor\r\ncan either side plead that overruling _necessity_ on which alone the\r\nright of self-defence is founded. They are governed at every step by\r\nthe Laws of War. But self-defence is independent of law; it knows no\r\nlaw, but springs from sudden tempestuous urgency, which brooks neither\r\ncircumscription nor delay. Define it, give it laws, circumscribe it by\r\na code, invest it with form, refine it by punctilio, and it becomes\r\n_the Duel_. And modern war, with its definitions, laws, limitations,\r\nforms, and refinements, is _the Duel of Nations_.\r\n\r\nThese nations are communities of Christian brothers. War is, therefore,\r\na duel between brothers; and here its impiety finds apt illustration in\r\nthe past. Far away in the early period of time, where uncertain hues\r\nof Poetry blend with the clearer light of History, our eyes discern\r\nthe fatal contest between those two brothers, Eteocles and Polynices.\r\nNo scene stirs deeper aversion; we do not inquire which was right.\r\nThe soul cries out, in bitterness and sorrow, _Both were wrong_, and\r\nrefuses to discriminate between them. A just and enlightened opinion,\r\ncontemplating the feuds and wars of mankind, will condemn both sides as\r\nwrong, pronouncing all war fratricidal, and every battle-field a scene\r\nfrom which to avert the countenance, as from that dismal duel beneath\r\nthe walls of Grecian Thebes.\r\n\r\nTo hasten this judgment our Philanthropist labored. \"Follow my white\r\nplume,\" said the chivalrous monarch of France. \"Follow the Right,\" more\r\nresplendent than plume or oriflamme, was the watchword of Channing.\r\nWith a soul kindling intensely at every story of magnanimous virtue, at\r\nevery deed of self-sacrifice in a righteous cause, his clear Christian\r\njudgment saw the mockery of what is called military glory, whether in\r\nancient thunderbolts of war or in the career of modern conquest. He\r\nsaw that the fairest flowers cannot bloom in soil moistened by human\r\nblood,--that to overcome evil by bullets and bayonets is less great and\r\nglorious than to overcome it by good,--that the courage of the camp is\r\ninferior to this Christian fortitude found in patience, resignation,\r\nand forgiveness of evil, as the spirit which scourged and crucified\r\nthe Saviour was less divine than that which murmured, \"Father, forgive\r\nthem, for they know not what they do.\"\r\n\r\nWith fearless pen he arraigned that giant criminal, Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\nWitnesses flocked from all his scenes of blood; and the pyramids of\r\nEgypt, the coast of Palestine, the plains of Italy, the snows of\r\nRussia, the fields of Austria, Prussia, Spain, all Europe, sent forth\r\nuncoffined hosts to bear testimony against the glory of their chief.\r\nNever before, in the name of humanity and freedom, was grand offender\r\narraigned by such a voice. The sentence of degradation which Channing\r\nhas passed, confirmed by coming generations, will darken the name of\r\nthe warrior more than any defeat of his arms or compelled abdication of\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\nThese causes Channing upheld and commended with admirable eloquence,\r\nboth of tongue and pen. Though abounding in beauty of thought and\r\nexpression, he will be judged less by single passages, sentences,\r\nor phrases, than by the continuous and harmonious treatment of his\r\nsubject. And yet everywhere the same spirit is discerned. What he said\r\nwas an effluence rather than a composition. His style was not formal\r\nor architectural in shape or proportion, but natural and flowing.\r\nOthers seem to construct, to build; he bears us forward on an unbroken\r\nstream. If we seek a parallel for him as writer, we must turn our backs\r\nupon England, and repair to France. Meditating on the glowing thought\r\nof Pascal, the persuasive sweetness of Fénelon, the constant and\r\ncomprehensive benevolence of the Abbé Saint Pierre, we may be reminded\r\nof Channing.\r\n\r\nWith few of the physical attributes belonging to the orator, he was\r\nan orator of surpassing grace. His soul tabernacled in a body that\r\nwas little more than a filament of clay. He was small in stature; but\r\nwhen he spoke, his person seemed to dilate with the majesty of his\r\nthoughts,--as the Hercules of Lysippus, a marvel of ancient art, though\r\nnot more than a foot in height, revived in the mind the superhuman\r\nstrength which overcame the Nemean lion:--\r\n\r\n    \"Deus ille, Deus; seseque videndum\r\n     Indulsit, Lysippe, tibi, _parvusque videri\r\n     Sentirique ingens_.\"[185]\r\n\r\n    [185] Statius, Silv., Lib. IV. Carm. 6.\r\n\r\nHis voice was soft and musical, not loud or full in tone; and yet, like\r\nconscience, it made itself heard in the inmost chambers of the soul.\r\nHis eloquence was gentleness and persuasion, reasoning for religion,\r\nhumanity, and justice. He did not thunder or lighten. The rude\r\nelemental forces furnish no proper image of his power. Like sunshine,\r\nhis words descended upon the souls of his hearers, and under their\r\ngenial influence the hard in heart were softened, while the closely\r\nhugged mantle of prejudice and error dropped to the earth.\r\n\r\nHis eloquence had not the character and fashion of forensic effort\r\nor parliamentary debate. It mounted above these, into an atmosphere\r\nunattempted by the applauded orators of the world. Whenever he spoke\r\nor wrote, it was with loftiest purpose, as his works attest,--not\r\nfor public display, not to advance himself, not on any question of\r\npecuniary interest, not under any worldly temptation, but to promote\r\nthe love of God and man. Here are untried founts of truest inspiration.\r\nEloquence has been called _action_; but it is something more. It\r\nis that divine and ceaseless energy which saves and helps mankind.\r\nIt cannot assume its highest form in personal pursuit of dishonest\r\nguardians, or selfish contention for a crown,--not in defence of a\r\nmurderer, or invective hurled at a conspirator. I would not over-step\r\nthe proper modesty of this discussion, nor would I disparage the genius\r\nof the great masters; but all must join in admitting that no rhetorical\r\nskill or oratorical power can elevate these lower, earthly things\r\nto the natural heights on which Channing stood, when he pleaded for\r\nFreedom and Peace.\r\n\r\nSuch was our Philanthropist. Advancing in life, his enthusiasm seemed\r\nto brighten, his soul put forth fresh blossoms of hope, his mind\r\nopened to new truths. Age brings experience; but, except in a few\r\nconstitutions of rare felicity, it renders the mind indifferent to\r\nwhat is new, particularly in moral truth. His last months were passed\r\namid the heights of Berkshire, with a people to whom may be applied\r\nwhat Bentivoglio said of Switzerland,--\"Their mountains become them,\r\nand they become their mountains.\" To them, on the 1st of August, 1842,\r\nhe volunteered an Anniversary Address, in commemoration of that great\r\nEnglish victory,--the peaceful emancipation of eight hundred thousand\r\nslaves. These were the last public words from his lips. His final\r\nbenediction descended on the slave. His spirit, taking flight, seemed\r\nto say,--nay, still says, _Remember the Slave_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus have I attempted, humbly and affectionately, to bring before you\r\nthe images of our departed brothers, while I dwelt on the great causes\r\nin which their lives were revealed. Servants of Knowledge, Justice,\r\nBeauty, Love, they have ascended to the great Source of Knowledge,\r\nJustice, Beauty, Love. Though dead, they yet speak, informing the\r\nunderstanding, strengthening the sense of justice, refining the tastes,\r\nenlarging the sympathies. The body dies; but the page of the Scholar,\r\nthe interpretation of the Jurist, the creation of the Artist, the\r\nbeneficence of the Philanthropist cannot die.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt upon their lives and characters, less in grief for what we\r\nhave lost than in gratitude for what we possessed so long, and still\r\nretain, in their precious example. Proudly recollecting her departed\r\nchildren, Alma Mater may well exclaim, in those touching words of\r\nparental grief, that she would not give her dead sons for any living\r\nsons in Christendom. Pickering, Story, Allston, Channing! A grand\r\nQuaternion! Each, in his peculiar sphere, was foremost in his country.\r\nEach might have said, what the modesty of Demosthenes did not forbid\r\nhim to boast, that, through him, his country had been crowned abroad.\r\nTheir labors were wide as Scholarship, Jurisprudence, Art, Humanity,\r\nand have found acceptance wherever these are recognized.\r\n\r\nTheir lives, which overflow with instruction, teach one persuasive\r\nlesson to all alike of every calling and pursuit,--_not to live for\r\nourselves alone_. They lived for Knowledge, Justice, Beauty, Love.\r\nTurning from the strifes of the world, the allurements of office,\r\nand the rage for gain, they consecrated themselves to the pursuit of\r\nexcellence, and each, in his own sphere, to beneficent labor. They were\r\nall philanthropists; for the labors of all were directed to the welfare\r\nand happiness of man.\r\n\r\nIn their presence, how truly do we feel the insignificance of\r\noffice and wealth, which men so hotly pursue! What is office? and\r\nwhat is wealth? Expressions and representatives of what is present\r\nand fleeting only, investing the possessor with a brief and local\r\nregard. Let this not be exaggerated; it must not be confounded\r\nwith the serene fame which is the reflection of generous labors in\r\ngreat causes. The street lights, within the circle of their nightly\r\nglimmer, seem to outshine the distant stars, observed of men in all\r\nlands and times; but gas-lamps are not to be mistaken for celestial\r\nluminaries. They who live for wealth, and the things of this world,\r\nfollow shadows, neglecting realities eternal on earth and in heaven.\r\nAfter the perturbations of life, all its accumulated possessions must\r\nbe resigned, except those only which have been devoted to God and\r\nmankind. What we do for _ourselves_ perishes with this mortal dust;\r\nwhat we do for _others_ lives coeval with the benefaction. Worms may\r\ndestroy the body, but they will not consume such a fame.\r\n\r\nStruggles of the selfish crowd, clamors of a false patriotism,\r\nsuggestions of a sordid ambition, cannot obscure that commanding duty\r\nwhich enjoins perpetual labor for the welfare of the whole human\r\nfamily, without distinction of country, color, or race. In this work,\r\nKnowledge, Jurisprudence, Art, Humanity, all are blessed ministers.\r\nMore puissant than the sword, they will lead mankind from the bondage\r\nof error into that service which alone is freedom:--\r\n\r\n    \"Hæ tibi erunt artes, _pacisque imponere morem_.\"[186]\r\n\r\n    [186] Æneid, VI. 852.--Dryden, translating this passage, gives\r\ndistinctness to a duty beyond the language of Virgil:--\r\n\r\n\"_The fettered slave to free_, These are imperial arts, and worthy\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\nThe brothers we commemorate join in summons to this gladsome obedience.\r\nTheir examples have voice. Go forth into the many mansions of the house\r\nof life. Scholar! store them with learning. Jurist! strengthen them\r\nwith justice. Artist! adorn them with beauty. Philanthropist! fill\r\nthem with love. Be servants of truth, each in his vocation,--sincere,\r\npure, earnest, enthusiastic. A virtuous enthusiasm is self-forgetful\r\nand noble. It is the grand inspiration yet vouchsafed to man. Like\r\nPickering, blend humility with learning. Like Story, ascend above the\r\npresent, in place and time. Like Allston, regard fame only as the\r\neternal shadow of excellence. Like Channing, plead for the good of\r\nman. Cultivate alike the wisdom of experience and the wisdom of hope.\r\nMindful of the future, do not neglect the past; awed by the majesty of\r\nantiquity, turn not with indifference from the new. True wisdom looks\r\nto the ages before, as well as behind. Like the Janus of the Capitol,\r\none front regards the past, rich with experience, with memories, with\r\npriceless traditions of virtue; the other is directed to the All\r\nHail Hereafter, richer still with transcendent hopes and unfulfilled\r\nprophecies.\r\n\r\nWe stand on the threshold of a new age, which is preparing to recognize\r\nnew influences. The ancient divinities of Violence and Wrong are\r\nretreating before the light of a better day. The sun is entering a new\r\necliptic, no longer deformed by those images of animal rage, Taurus,\r\nLeo, Scorpio, Sagittarius, but beaming with the mild radiance of those\r\nheavenly signs, Faith, Hope, and Charity.\r\n\r\n    \"There's a fount about to stream,\r\n     There's a light about to beam,\r\n     There's a warmth about to glow,\r\n     There's a flower about to blow,\r\n     There's a midnight blackness changing\r\n     Into gray:\r\n     Men of thought, and men of action,\r\n     _Clear the way!_\r\n\r\n    \"Aid the dawning, tongue and pen!\r\n     Aid it, hopes of honest men!\r\n     Aid it, paper! aid it, type!\r\n     Aid it, for the hour is ripe,\r\n     And our earnest must not slacken\r\n     Into play:\r\n     Men of thought, and men of action,\r\n     _Clear the way!_\"\r\n\r\nThe age of Chivalry is gone. An age of Humanity has come. The Horse,\r\nwhose importance, more than human, gave its name to that early period\r\nof gallantry and war, now yields the foremost place to Man. In serving\r\nhim, in studying his elevation, in helping his welfare, in doing him\r\ngood, are fields of bloodless triumph, nobler far than any in which\r\nBayard or Du Guesclin conquered. Here are spaces of labor, wide as the\r\nworld, lofty as heaven. Let me say, then, in the benison once bestowed\r\nupon the youthful knight,--Scholar! Jurist! Artist! Philanthropist!\r\nhero of a Christian age, companion of a celestial knighthood, \"Go\r\nforth, be brave, loyal, and successful!\"\r\n\r\nAnd may it be our office to light a fresh beacon-fire on the\r\nvenerable walls of Harvard, sacred to Truth, to Christ, and to the\r\nChurch,[187]--to Truth Immortal, to Christ the Comforter, to the Holy\r\nChurch Universal. Let the flame pass from steeple to steeple, from hill\r\nto hill, from island to island, from continent to continent, till the\r\nlong lineage of fires illumine all the nations of the earth, animating\r\nthem to the holy contests of KNOWLEDGE, JUSTICE, BEAUTY, LOVE!\r\n\r\n    [187] The legend on the early seal of Harvard University was _Veritas_.\r\nThe present legend is _Christo et Ecclesiæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 ANTISLAVERY DUTIES OF THE WHIG PARTY.\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT THE WHIG STATE CONVENTION OF MASSACHUSETTS, IN FANEUIL HALL,\r\n                      BOSTON, SEPTEMBER 23, 1846.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was organized by the appointment of Hon. Charles Hudson,\r\nof Westminster, President,--Nathan Appleton, of Boston, Stephen C.\r\nPhillips, of Salem, Amos Abbott, of Andover, Samuel Hoar, of Concord,\r\nThomas Kinnicutt, of Worcester, Isaac King, of Palmer, E.R. Coit, of\r\nPittsfield, A. Richards, of Dedham, Artemas Hale, of Bridgewater, and\r\nAaron Mitchell, of Nantucket, Vice-Presidents,--and F.W. Lincoln,\r\nJr., of Boston, William S. Robinson, of Lowell, George Marston, of\r\nBarnstable, and E.G. Bowdoin, of South Hadley, Secretaries.\r\n\r\nAfter the appointment of a committee to report resolutions, and its\r\nwithdrawal for this purpose, there was a call for Mr. Sumner, who\r\ncame forward and spoke. This incident was described by the _Daily\r\nAdvertiser_, in its account of the proceedings, as follows.\r\n\r\n\"After this committee had gone out, Charles Sumner, Esq., of this\r\ncity, in response to a general call, took the stand and made a very\r\neloquent speech, which was received with sympathy and repeated bursts\r\nof applause.... An allusion which he made to Daniel Webster in terms\r\nof the highest admiration, and an appeal to him to add to his title\r\nof _Defender of the Constitution_ that of _Defender of Freedom_\r\n[_Humanity_], was received with great applause.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Winthrop, at the call of the Convention, spoke immediately after\r\nMr. Sumner.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Sumner stepped from the platform, Mr. Appleton, one of the\r\nVice-Presidents, said to him, \"A good speech for Virginia, but out of\r\nplace here\"; to which Mr. Sumner replied, \"If good for Virginia, it is\r\ngood for Boston, as we have our responsibilities for Slavery.\" This\r\nincident is mentioned as opening briefly the practical issue made by\r\nmany with regard to the discussion of Slavery at the North.\r\n\r\n    MR. PRESIDENT AND FELLOW-CITIZENS, WHIGS OF MASSACHUSETTS:--\r\n\r\n    Grateful for the honor done me in this early call to address the\r\n    Convention, I shall endeavor to speak with sincerity and frankness\r\n    on the duties of the Whig party. It is of Duties that I shall speak.\r\n\r\n    On the first notice that our meeting was to be in Boston, many\r\n    were disposed to regret that the country was not selected instead,\r\n    believing that the opinions of the country, free as its bracing\r\n    air, more than those of Boston, were in harmony with the tone\r\n    becoming us at the present crisis. In the country is the spirit\r\n    of freedom, in the city the spirit of commerce; and though these\r\n    two spirits may at times act in admirable conjunction and with\r\n    irresistible strength, yet it sometimes occurs that the generous\r\n    and unselfish impulses of the one are checked and controlled by the\r\n    careful calculations of the other. Even Right and Liberty are, in\r\n    some minds, of less significance than dividends and dollars.\r\n\r\n    But I am happy that the Convention is convoked in Faneuil Hall,--a\r\n    place vocal with inspiring accents; and though on other occasions\r\n    words have been uttered here which the lover of morals, of freedom,\r\n    and humanity must regret, these walls, faithful only to Freedom,\r\n    refuse to echo them. Whigs of Massachusetts, in Faneuil Hall\r\n    assembled, must be true to this early scene of patriot struggles;\r\n    they must be true to their own name, which has descended from the\r\n    brave men who took part in those struggles.\r\n\r\n    We are a Convention of Whigs. And who are the Whigs? Some may say\r\n    they are supporters of the Tariff; others, that they are advocates\r\n    of Internal Improvements, of measures to restrict the Veto Power,\r\n    or it may be of a Bank. All these are now, or have been, prominent\r\n    articles of the party. But this enumeration does not do justice to\r\n    the Whig character.\r\n\r\n    The Whigs, as their name imports, are, or ought to be, the party\r\n    of Freedom. They seek, or should seek, on all occasions, to carry\r\n    out fully and practically the principles of our institutions. Those\r\n    principles which our fathers declared, and sealed with their blood,\r\n    their Whig children should seek to manifest in acts. The Whigs,\r\n    therefore, reverence the Declaration of Independence, as embodying\r\n    the vital truths of Freedom, especially that great truth, \"that\r\n    all men are created equal.\" They reverence the Constitution of the\r\n    United States, and seek to guard it against infractions, believing\r\n    that under the Constitution Freedom can be best preserved. They\r\n    reverence the Union, believing that the peace, happiness, and\r\n    welfare of all depend upon this blessed bond. They reverence the\r\n    public faith, and require that it shall be punctiliously kept in\r\n    all laws, charters, and obligations. They reverence the principles\r\n    of morality, truth, justice, right. They seek to advance their\r\n    country rather than individuals, and to promote the welfare of the\r\n    people rather than of leaders. A member of such an association,\r\n    founded on the highest moral sentiments, recognizing conscience and\r\n    benevolence as animating ideas, is not open to the accusation that\r\n    he \"to party gave up what was meant for mankind,\"--since all the\r\n    interests of the party must be coincident and commensurate with the\r\n    manifold interests of humanity.\r\n\r\n    Such is, as I trust, the Whig party of Massachusetts. It refuses\r\n    to identify itself exclusively with those measures of transient\r\n    policy which, like the Bank, may become \"obsolete ideas,\" but\r\n    connects itself with everlasting principles which can never fade or\r\n    decay. Doing this, it does not neglect other things, as the Tariff,\r\n    or Internal Improvements; but it treats them as subordinate. Far\r\n    less does it show indifference to the Constitution or the Union;\r\n    for it seeks to render these guardians and representatives of the\r\n    principles to which we are attached.\r\n\r\n    The Whigs have been called by you, Mr. President, _conservatives_.\r\n    In a just sense, they should be conservatives,--not of forms only,\r\n    but of substance,--not of the letter only, but of the living\r\n    spirit. The Whigs should be conservators of the ancestral spirit,\r\n    conservators of the animating ideas in which our institutions were\r\n    born. They should profess that truest and highest conservatism\r\n    which watches, guards, and preserves the great principles of Truth,\r\n    Right, Freedom, and Humanity. Such a conservatism is not narrow and\r\n    exclusive, but broad and expansive. It is not trivial and bigoted,\r\n    but manly and generous. It is the conservatism of '76.\r\n\r\n    Let me say, then, that the Whigs of Massachusetts are--I hope it\r\n    is not my wish only that is father to the thought--the party which\r\n    seeks the establishment of Truth, Freedom, Right, and Humanity,\r\n    under the Constitution of the United States, and by the Union of\r\n    the States. They are Unionists, Constitutionalists, Friends of the\r\n    Right.\r\n\r\n    The question here arises, How shall this party, inspired by these\r\n    principles, now act? The answer is easy. In strict accordance with\r\n    their principles. It must utter them with distinctness, and act\r\n    upon them with energy.\r\n\r\n    The party will naturally express opposition to the present\r\n    Administration for its treacherous course on the tariff, and\r\n    for its interference by veto with internal improvements; but it\r\n    will be more alive to evils of greater magnitude,--the unjust and\r\n    unchristian war with Mexico, which is not less absurd than wicked,\r\n    and, beyond this, the institution of Slavery.\r\n\r\n    The time, I believe, has gone by, when the question is asked,\r\n    _What has the North to do with Slavery?_ It might almost be\r\n    answered, that, politically, it has little to do with anything\r\n    else,--so are all the acts of our Government connected, directly\r\n    or indirectly, with this institution. Slavery is everywhere.\r\n    Appealing to the Constitution, it enters the Halls of Congress, in\r\n    the disproportionate representation of the Slave States. It holds\r\n    its disgusting mart at Washington, in the shadow of the Capitol,\r\n    under the legislative jurisdiction of the Nation,--of the North as\r\n    well as the South. It sends its miserable victims over the high\r\n    seas, from the ports of Virginia to the ports of Louisiana, beneath\r\n    the protecting flag of the Republic. It presumes to follow into\r\n    the Free States those fugitives who, filled with the inspiration\r\n    of Freedom, seek our altars for safety; nay, more, with profane\r\n    hands it seizes those who have never known the name of slave,\r\n    freemen of the North, and dooms them to irremediable bondage. It\r\n    insults and expels from its jurisdiction honored representatives\r\n    of Massachusetts, seeking to secure for her colored citizens\r\n    the peaceful safeguard of the Union. It assumes at pleasure to\r\n    build up new slaveholding States, striving perpetually to widen\r\n    its area, while professing to extend the area of Freedom. It\r\n    has brought upon the country war with Mexico, with its enormous\r\n    expenditures and more enormous guilt. By the spirit of union among\r\n    its supporters, it controls the affairs of Government,--interferes\r\n    with the cherished interests of the North, enforcing and then\r\n    refusing protection to her manufactures,--makes and unmakes\r\n    Presidents,--usurps to itself the larger portion of all offices\r\n    of honor and profit, both in the army and navy, and also in the\r\n    civil department,--and stamps upon our whole country the character,\r\n    before the world, of that monstrous anomaly and mockery, _a\r\n    slaveholding republic_, with the living truths of Freedom on its\r\n    lips and the dark mark of Slavery on its brow.\r\n\r\n    In opposition to Slavery, Massachusetts has already, to a certain\r\n    extent, done what becomes her character as a free Commonwealth.\r\n    By successive resolutions of her Legislature, she has called for\r\n    the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and for the\r\n    abolition of the slave-trade between the States; and she has also\r\n    proposed an amendment of the Constitution, putting the South upon\r\n    an equality with the North in Congressional representation. More\r\n    than this, her judiciary, always pure, fearless, and upright, has\r\n    inflicted upon Slavery the brand of reprobation. I but recall a\r\n    familiar fact, when I refer to the opinion of the Supreme Court\r\n    of Massachusetts, where it is expressly declared that \"slavery is\r\n    contrary to natural right, to the principles of justice, humanity,\r\n    and sound policy.\"[188] This is the law of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n    [188] 18 Pick. Rep. 215.\r\n\r\n    And shall this Commonwealth continue in any way to sustain an\r\n    institution which its laws declare to be contrary to natural right,\r\n    justice, humanity, and sound policy? Shall Whigs support what is\r\n    contrary to the fundamental principles of the party? Here the\r\n    consciences of good men respond to the judgment of the Court.\r\n    If it be wrong to hold a single slave, it must be wrong to hold\r\n    many. If it be wrong for an individual to hold a slave, it must be\r\n    wrong for a State. If it be wrong for a State in its individual\r\n    capacity, it must be wrong also in association with other States.\r\n    Massachusetts does not allow any of her citizens within her borders\r\n    to hold slaves. Let her be consistent, and call for the abolition\r\n    of slavery wherever she is any way responsible for it, not only\r\n    where she is a party to it, but wherever it may be reached by her\r\n    influence,--that is, everywhere beneath the Constitution and laws\r\n    of the National Government. \"If any practices exist,\" said Mr.\r\n    Webster, in one of those earlier efforts which commended him to our\r\n    admiration, his Discourse at Plymouth in 1820,--\"if any practices\r\n    exist contrary to the principles of justice and humanity, within\r\n    the reach of our laws or our influence, _we are inexcusable, if we\r\n    do not exert ourselves to restrain and abolish them_.\"[189] This\r\n    is correct, worthy of its author, and of Massachusetts. It points\r\n    directly to Massachusetts as inexcusable for not doing her best to\r\n    restrain and abolish slavery everywhere within the reach of her\r\n    laws or her influence.\r\n\r\n    [189] Works, Vol. I. p. 45.\r\n\r\n    Certainly, to labor in this cause is far higher and nobler than to\r\n    strive for _repeal of the Tariff_, once the tocsin to rally the\r\n    Whigs. REPEAL OF SLAVERY UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF THE\r\n    NATIONAL GOVERNMENT is a watchword more Christian and more potent,\r\n    because it embodies a higher sentiment and a more commanding duty.\r\n\r\n    The time has passed when this can be opposed on constitutional\r\n    grounds. It will not be questioned by any competent authority, that\r\n    Congress may, by express legislation, abolish slavery: first, in\r\n    the District of Columbia; secondly, in the Territories, if there\r\n    should be any; thirdly, that it may abolish the slave-trade on the\r\n    high seas between the States; fourthly, that it may refuse to admit\r\n    new States with a constitution sanctioning slavery. Nor can it be\r\n    questioned that the people of the United States may, in the manner\r\n    pointed out by the Constitution, proceed to its amendment. It is,\r\n    then, by constitutional legislation, and even by amendment of the\r\n    Constitution, that slavery may be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here the question arises, Is there any _compromise_ in the\r\n    Constitution of such a character as to prevent action? This word\r\n    is invoked by many honest minds as the excuse for not joining in\r\n    this cause. Let me meet this question frankly and fairly. The\r\n    Constitution, it is said, was the result of compromise between the\r\n    Free States and the Slave States, which good faith will not allow\r\n    us to break. To this it may be replied, that the Slave States, by\r\n    their many violations of the Constitution, have already overturned\r\n    all the original compromises, if any there were of perpetual\r\n    character. But I do not content myself with this answer. I wish\r\n    to say, distinctly, that there is no compromise on slavery not to\r\n    be reached _legally and constitutionally_, which is the only way\r\n    in which I propose to reach it. Wherever powers and jurisdiction\r\n    are secured to Congress, they may unquestionably be exercised in\r\n    conformity with the Constitution; even in matters beyond existing\r\n    powers and jurisdiction there is a constitutional method of action.\r\n    The Constitution contains an article pointing out how, at any time,\r\n    amendments may be made. This is an important element, giving to\r\n    the Constitution a _progressive_ character, and allowing it to be\r\n    moulded according to new exigencies and conditions of feeling.\r\n    The wise framers of this instrument did not treat the country as a\r\n    Chinese foot,--never to grow after its infancy,--but anticipated\r\n    the changes incident to its advance. \"_Provided_, that no amendment\r\n    which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred\r\n    and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses\r\n    in the ninth section of the first article, and that no State,\r\n    without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the\r\n    Senate.\" These are the words of the Constitution. They expressly\r\n    designate what shall be sacred from amendment,--what compromise\r\n    shall be perpetual,--and so doing, according to a familiar rule\r\n    of law and of logic, virtually declare that the remainder of the\r\n    Constitution may be amended. Already, since its adoption, twelve\r\n    amendments have been made, and every year produces new projects.\r\n    There has been a pressure on the floor of Congress to abrogate the\r\n    veto, and also to limit the tenure of the Presidential office.\r\n    Let it be distinctly understood, then,--and this is my answer to\r\n    the pretension of binding compromise,--that, in conferring upon\r\n    Congress certain specified powers and jurisdiction, and also in\r\n    providing for the amendment of the Constitution, its framers\r\n    expressly established the means for setting aside what are vaguely\r\n    called compromises of the Constitution. They openly declare,\r\n    \"Legislate as you please, in conformity with the Constitution;\r\n    and even make amendments rendered proper by change of opinion or\r\n    circumstances, following always the manner prescribed.\"\r\n\r\n    Nor can we dishonor the revered authors of the Constitution by\r\n    supposing that they set their hands to it, believing that under\r\n    it slavery was to be _perpetual_,--that the Republic, which they\r\n    had reared to its giant stature, snatched from heaven the sacred\r\n    fire of Freedom, only to be bound, like another Prometheus, in\r\n    adamantine chains of Fate, while Slavery, like another vulture,\r\n    preyed upon its vitals. Let Franklin speak for them. He was\r\n    President of the earliest Abolition Society in the United States,\r\n    and in 1790, only two years after the adoption of the Constitution,\r\n    addressed a petition to Congress, calling upon them to \"step to\r\n    the very verge of the power vested in them for discouraging every\r\n    species of traffic in the persons of our fellow-men.\"[190] Let\r\n    Jefferson speak for them. His desire for the abolition of slavery\r\n    was often expressed with philanthropic warmth and emphasis, and is\r\n    too familiar to be quoted. Let Washington speak for them. \"It is\r\n    among my first wishes,\" he said, in a letter to John F. Mercer,\r\n    \"to see some plan adopted by which slavery in this country _may\r\n    be abolished by law_.\"[191] And in his will, penned with his own\r\n    hand, during the last year of his life, he bore his testimony\r\n    again, by providing for the emancipation of all his slaves. It is\r\n    thus that Washington speaks, not only by words, but by actions\r\n    more significant \"Give freedom to your slaves.\" The Father of his\r\n    Country requires, as a token of the filial piety which all profess,\r\n    that his example shall be followed. I am not insensible to the many\r\n    glories of his character; but I cannot contemplate this act without\r\n    a fresh feeling of admiration and gratitude. The martial scene\r\n    depicted on that votive canvas may fade from the memory of men; but\r\n    this act of justice and benevolence can never perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"Ergo postque magisque viri nunc gloria claret.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    [190] Annals of Congress, First Congress, Second Session, col. 1198.\r\n\r\n    [191] Sparks's Writings of Washington, Vol. IX. p. 159, note.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I assume, then, that it is the duty of Whigs professing the\r\n    principles of the fathers to express themselves openly,\r\n    distinctly, and solemnly against slavery,--_not only against its\r\n    further extension, but against its longer continuance under the\r\n    Constitution and Laws of the Union_. But while it is their duty\r\n    to enter upon this holy warfare, it should be their aim to temper\r\n    it with moderation, with gentleness, with tenderness, towards\r\n    slave-owners. These should be won, if possible, rather than driven,\r\n    to the duties of emancipation. But emancipation should always be\r\n    presented as the cardinal object of our national policy.\r\n\r\n    It is for the Whigs of Massachusetts now to say whether the\r\n    republican edifice shall indeed be one where all the Christian\r\n    virtues will be fellow-workers with them. The resolutions which\r\n    they adopt, the platform of principles which they establish, must\r\n    be the imperishable foundation of a true glory.\r\n\r\n    But it will not be sufficient to pass _resolutions_ opposing\r\n    slavery; we must choose _men_ who will devote themselves earnestly,\r\n    heartily, to the work,--who will enter upon it with awakened\r\n    conscience, and with that valiant faith before which all obstacles\r\n    disappear,--who will be ever loyal to Truth, Freedom, Right,\r\n    Humanity,--who will not look for rules of conduct down to earth,\r\n    in the mire of expediency, but with heaven-directed countenance\r\n    seek those great \"primal duties\" which \"shine aloft like stars,\"\r\n    to illumine alike the path of individuals and of nations. They\r\n    must be true to the principles of Massachusetts. They must not\r\n    be Northern men with Southern principles, nor Northern men under\r\n    Southern influences. They must be courageous and willing on all\r\n    occasions to stand alone, provided Right be with them. \"Were there\r\n    as many devils in Worms as there are tiles upon the roofs,\" said\r\n    Martin Luther, \"yet would I enter.\" Such a spirit is needed now\r\n    by the advocates of Right. They must not be ashamed of the name\r\n    which belongs to Franklin, Jefferson, and Washington,--expressing\r\n    the idea which should be theirs,--Abolitionist. They must be\r\n    thorough, uncompromising advocates of the repeal of slavery,--of\r\n    its abolition under the laws and Constitution of the United States.\r\n    They must be Repealers, Abolitionists.\r\n\r\n    There are a few such now in Congress. Massachusetts has a\r\n    venerable Representative,[192] whose aged bosom still glows with\r\n    inextinguishable fires, like the central heats of the monarch\r\n    mountain of the Andes beneath its canopy of snow. To this cause\r\n    he dedicates the closing energies of a long and illustrious life.\r\n    Would that all might join him!\r\n\r\n    [192] John Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n    There is a Senator of Massachusetts we had hoped to welcome here\r\n    to-day, whose position is of commanding influence. Let me address\r\n    him with the respectful frankness of a constituent and friend.\r\n    Already, Sir, by various labors, you have acquired an honorable\r\n    place in the history of our country. By the vigor, argumentation,\r\n    and eloquence with which you upheld the Union, and that\r\n    interpretation of the Constitution which makes us a Nation, you\r\n    have justly earned the title of _Defender of the Constitution_. By\r\n    masterly and successful negotiation, and by efforts to compose the\r\n    strife concerning Oregon, you have earned another title,--_Defender\r\n    of Peace_. Pardon me, if I add, that there are yet other duties\r\n    claiming your care, whose performance will be the crown of a long\r\n    life in the public service. Do not forget them. Dedicate, Sir, the\r\n    years happily in store for you, with all that precious experience\r\n    which is yours, to grand endeavor, in the name of Human Freedom,\r\n    for the overthrow of that terrible evil which now afflicts our\r\n    country. In this cause are inspirations to eloquence higher than\r\n    any you have yet confessed.\r\n\r\n      \"To heavenly themes sublimer strains belong.\"\r\n\r\n    Do not shrink from the task. With the marvellous powers that are\r\n    yours, under the auspicious influences of an awakened public\r\n    sentiment, and under God, who smiles always upon conscientious\r\n    labor for the welfare of man, we may hope for beneficent results.\r\n    Assume, then, these unperformed duties. The aged shall bear witness\r\n    to you; the young shall kindle with rapture, as they repeat the\r\n    name of Webster; the large company of the ransomed shall teach\r\n    their children and their children's children, to the latest\r\n    generation, to call you blessed; and you shall have yet another\r\n    title, never to be forgotten on earth or in heaven,--_Defender\r\n    of Humanity_,--by the side of which that earlier title will fade\r\n    into insignificance, as the Constitution, which is the work of\r\n    mortal hands, dwindles by the side of Man, created in the image of\r\n    God.[193]\r\n\r\n    [193] How Mr. Webster regarded this appeal will be seen in a letter\r\nfrom him at the end of the Speech.\r\n\r\n    To my mind it is clear that the time has arrived when the Whigs\r\n    of Massachusetts, the party of Freedom, owe it to their declared\r\n    principles, to their character before the world, and to conscience,\r\n    that they should place themselves firmly on this honest ground.\r\n    They need not fear to stand alone. They need not fear separation\r\n    from brethren with whom they have acted in concert. Better be\r\n    separated even from them than from the Right. Massachusetts can\r\n    stand alone, if need be. The Whigs of Massachusetts can stand\r\n    alone. Their motto should not be, \"Our party, _howsoever bounded_,\"\r\n    but \"Our party, bounded always by the Right.\" They must recognize\r\n    the dominion of Right, or there will be none who will recognize\r\n    the dominion of the party. Let us, then, in Faneuil Hall, beneath\r\n    the images of our fathers, vow perpetual allegiance to the Right,\r\n    and perpetual hostility to Slavery. Ours is a noble cause, nobler\r\n    even than that of our fathers, inasmuch as it is more exalted to\r\n    struggle for the freedom of _others_ than for _our own_. The love\r\n    of Right, which is the animating impulse of our movement, is higher\r\n    even than the love of Freedom. But Right, Freedom, and Humanity all\r\n    concur in demanding the Abolition of Slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 LETTER OF MR. WEBSTER TO MR. SUMNER.\r\n\r\n                                         MARSHFIELD, October 5, 1846.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,--I had the pleasure to receive yours of September\r\n    25th, and thank you for the kind and friendly sentiments which you\r\n    express. These sentiments are reciprocal. I have ever cherished\r\n    high respect for your character and talents, and seen with pleasure\r\n    the promise of your future and greater eminence and usefulness.\r\n\r\n    In political affairs we happen to entertain, at the present moment,\r\n    a difference of opinion respecting the relative importance of some\r\n    of the political questions of the time, and take a different view\r\n    of the line of duty most fit to be pursued in endeavors to obtain\r\n    all the good which can be obtained in connection with certain\r\n    important subjects. These differences I much regret, but shall not\r\n    allow them to interfere with personal regard, or my continued good\r\n    wishes for your prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\n                              Yours truly,\r\n                                                     DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n    MR. SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              WRONGFUL DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST MEXICO.\r\n\r\n  LETTER TO HON. ROBERT C. WINTHROP, REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM\r\n                       BOSTON, OCTOBER 25, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sir,--Newspapers, and some among your friends, complain of the\r\n    manner in which many of your constituents are obliged to regard\r\n    your vote on the Mexican War Bill. This vote is defended with an\r\n    ardor such as even Truth, Freedom, and Right do not always find in\r\n    their behalf,--while honest strictures are attributed to personal\r\n    motives, sometimes to a selfish desire for the place you now hold,\r\n    sometimes even to a wanton purpose to injure you.\r\n\r\n    All this may be the natural and inevitable incident of political\r\n    controversy; but it must be regretted that personal feelings\r\n    and imputations of personal selfishness should intrude into the\r\n    discussion of an important question of public duty,--I might say,\r\n    of public morals. As a Whig, never failing to vote for you when I\r\n    had an opportunity, I have felt it proper on other occasions to\r\n    review your course, and to express the sorrow it caused. For this\r\n    I am arraigned; and the question of public morals is forgotten\r\n    in personal feeling. This is my excuse for recalling attention\r\n    now to the true issue. Conscious of no feeling to yourself\r\n    personally, except of good-will, mingled with the recollection\r\n    of pleasant social intercourse, I refer with pain to your vote,\r\n    and the apologies for it which have been set up. As one of your\r\n    constituents, I single you, who are the representative of Boston,\r\n    among the majority with whom you acted. I am not a politician;\r\n    and you will pardon me, therefore, if I do not bring your conduct\r\n    to any test of party or of numbers, to any sliding scale of\r\n    expediency, to any standard except the rule of Right and Wrong.\r\n\r\n    To understand your course, it will be necessary to consider the\r\n    action of Congress in declaring war against Mexico. I shall state\r\n    the facts and conclusions briefly as possible.\r\n\r\n    By virtue of an unconstitutional Act of Congress, in conjunction\r\n    with the _de facto_ government of Texas, the latter was annexed\r\n    to the United States some time in the month of December, 1845.\r\n    If we regard Texas as a province of Mexico, its boundaries must\r\n    be sought in the geography of that republic. If we regard it as\r\n    an independent State, they must be determined by the extent of\r\n    jurisdiction which the State was able to maintain. Now it seems\r\n    clear that the river Nueces was always recognized by Mexico as\r\n    the western boundary; and it is undisputed that the State of\r\n    Texas, since its Declaration of Independence, never exercised any\r\n    jurisdiction beyond the Nueces. The Act of Annexation could not,\r\n    therefore, transfer to the United States any title to the region\r\n    between the Nueces and the Rio Grande. That region belonged to\r\n    Mexico. _Certainly_ it did not belong to the United States.\r\n\r\n    In the month of January, 1846, the President of the United States\r\n    directed the troops under General Taylor, called the Army of\r\n    Occupation, to take possession of this region. Here was an act of\r\n    aggression. As might have been expected, it produced collision.\r\n    The Mexicans, aroused in self-defence, sought to repel the invaders\r\n    from their hearths and churches. Unexpected tidings reached\r\n    Washington that the American forces were in danger. The President,\r\n    in a message to Congress, called for succors.\r\n\r\n    Here the question occurs, What was the duty of Congress in this\r\n    emergency? Clearly to withhold all sanction to unjust war,--to\r\n    aggression upon a neighboring Republic,--to spoliation of\r\n    fellow-men. Our troops were in danger only because upon foreign\r\n    soil, forcibly displacing the jurisdiction and laws of the rightful\r\n    government. In this condition of things, the way of safety, just\r\n    and honorable, was by instant withdrawal from the Rio Grande to the\r\n    Nueces. Congress should have spoken like Washington, when General\r\n    Braddock, staggered by the peril of the moment, asked the youthful\r\n    soldier, \"What shall I do, Colonel Washington?\" \"RETREAT, Sir!\r\n    RETREAT, Sir!\" was the earnest reply. The American forces should\r\n    have been directed to _retreat_,--not from any human force, but\r\n    from _wrong-doing_; and this would have been a true victory.\r\n\r\n    Alas! this was not the mood of Congress. With wicked speed a\r\n    bill was introduced, furnishing large and unusual supplies of\r\n    men and money. In any just sense, such provision was wasteful\r\n    and unnecessary; but it would hardly be worthy of criticism, if\r\n    confined in its object to the safety of the troops. When made,\r\n    it must have been known that the fate of the troops was already\r\n    decided, while the magnitude of the appropriations and the number\r\n    of volunteers called for showed that measures were contemplated\r\n    _beyond self-defence_. Self-defence is easy and cheap. Aggression\r\n    and injustice are difficult and costly.\r\n\r\n    The bill, in its earliest guise, provided money and volunteers\r\n    only. Suddenly an amendment is introduced, in the nature of a\r\n    preamble, which gives to it _another character_, in harmony with\r\n    the covert design of the large appropriation. This was adopted by\r\n    a vote of 123 to 67; and the bill then leaped forth, fully armed,\r\n    as a measure of open and active hostility against Mexico. As such,\r\n    it was passed by a vote of 174 to 14. This was on the 11th of May,\r\n    1846, destined to be among the dark days of our history.\r\n\r\n    The amendment, in the nature of a preamble, and the important part\r\n    of the bill, are as follows.\r\n\r\n    \"_Whereas, by the act of the Republic of Mexico, a state of war exists\r\n    between that Government and the United States,_--\r\n\r\n    \"Be it enacted, &c., _That, for the purpose of enabling the Government\r\n    of the United States to prosecute said war to a speedy and successful\r\n    termination_, the President be, and he is hereby, authorized to employ\r\n    the militia, naval, and military forces of the United States, and to\r\n    call for and accept the services of any number of volunteers, not\r\n    exceeding fifty thousand, and that the sum of ten millions of dollars\r\n    be, and the same is hereby, appropriated for the purpose.\"\r\n\r\n    This Act cannot be regarded merely as provision for the safety of\r\n    General Taylor; nor, indeed can this be considered the principal\r\n    end proposed. It has other and ulterior objects, broader and more\r\n    general, in view of which his safety, important as it might be, is\r\n    of comparative insignificance; as it would be less mournful to lose\r\n    a whole army than lend the solemn sanction of legislation to an\r\n    unjust war.\r\n\r\n    This Act may be considered in six different aspects. It is six\r\n    times wrong. Six different and unanswerable reasons should have\r\n    urged its rejection. Six different appeals should have touched\r\n    every heart. I shall consider them separately.\r\n\r\n    _First._ It is practically a DECLARATION OF WAR against a sister\r\n    Republic. By the Constitution of the United States, the power of\r\n    declaring war is vested in Congress. Before this Act was passed,\r\n    the Mexican War had no legislative sanction. Without this Act it\r\n    could have no legislative sanction. _By virtue of this Act_ the\r\n    present war is waged. _By virtue of this Act_, an American fleet,\r\n    at immense cost of money, and without any gain of character, is\r\n    now disturbing the commerce of Mexico, and of the civilized world,\r\n    by the blockade of Vera Cruz. _By virtue of this Act_, a distant\r\n    expedition, with pilfering rapacity, has seized the defenceless\r\n    province of California. _By virtue of this Act_ General Kearney has\r\n    marched upon and captured Santa Fe. _By virtue of this Act_ General\r\n    Taylor has perpetrated the massacre at Monterey. _By virtue of this\r\n    Act_ desolation has been carried into a thousand homes, while the\r\n    uncoffined bodies of sons, brothers, and husbands are consigned\r\n    to premature graves. Lastly, it is _by virtue of this Act_ that\r\n    the army of the United States has been converted into a _legalized\r\n    band_ of brigands, marauders, and banditti, against the sanctions\r\n    of civilization, justice, and humanity. American soldiers, who have\r\n    fallen wretchedly in the streets of a foreign city, in the attack\r\n    upon a _Bishop's_ palace, in contest with Christian fellow-men\r\n    defending firesides and altars, may claim the epitaph of Simonides:\r\n    \"Go, tell the Lacedæmonians that we lie here in obedience to their\r\n    commands.\" It was in obedience to this Act of Congress that they\r\n    laid down their lives.\r\n\r\n    _Secondly._ This Act gives the sanction of Congress to an _unjust_\r\n    war. War is barbarous and brutal; but this is unjust. It grows\r\n    out of aggression on our part, and is continued by aggression. The\r\n    statement of facts already made is sufficient on this head.\r\n\r\n    _Thirdly._ It declares that war exists \"_by the act of the Republic\r\n    of Mexico_.\" This statement of brazen falsehood is inserted in the\r\n    front of the Act. But it is now admitted by most, if not all, of\r\n    the Whigs who unhappily voted for it, that it is not founded in\r\n    fact. It is a national lie.\r\n\r\n            \"Whose tongue soe'er speaks false\r\n     Not truly speaks; _who speaks not truly_ LIES.\"\r\n\r\n    _Fourthly._ It provides for the prosecution of the war \"_to a\r\n    speedy and successful termination_,\"--that is, for the speedy and\r\n    successful prosecution of _unjust_ war. Surely no rule can be\r\n    better founded in morals than that we should seek the establishment\r\n    of _right_. How, then, can we strive to hasten the triumph of wrong?\r\n\r\n    _Fifthly._ The war has its origin in a series of measures to extend\r\n    and perpetuate slavery. A wise and humane legislator should have\r\n    discerned its source, and found fresh impulses to oppose it.\r\n\r\n    _Sixthly._ The war is dishonorable and cowardly, as the attack of\r\n    a rich, powerful, numerous, and united republic upon a weak and\r\n    defenceless neighbor, distracted by civil feud. Every consideration\r\n    of honor, manliness, and Christian duty prompted gentleness and\r\n    forbearance towards our unfortunate sister.\r\n\r\n    Such, Sir, is the Act of Congress which received your sanction.\r\n    Hardly does it yield in importance to any measure of our Government\r\n    since the adoption of the National Constitution. It is the most\r\n    wicked in our history, as it is one of the most wicked in all\r\n    history. The recording Muse will drop a tear over its turpitude\r\n    and injustice, while it is gibbeted for the disgust and\r\n    reprobation of mankind.\r\n\r\n    Such, Sir, is the Act of Congress to which by your affirmative vote\r\n    the people of Boston are made parties. Through _you_ they are made\r\n    to _declare unjust and cowardly war, with superadded falsehood, in\r\n    the cause of Slavery_. Through _you_ they are made partakers in\r\n    the blockade of Vera Cruz, the seizure of California, the capture\r\n    of Santa Fe, the bloodshed of Monterey. It were idle to suppose\r\n    that the soldier or officer only is stained by this guilt. It\r\n    reaches far back, and incarnadines the Halls of Congress; nay,\r\n    more, through you, it reddens the hands of your constituents in\r\n    Boston. Pardon this language. Strong as it may seem, it is weak to\r\n    express the aggravation of this Act. Rather than lend your hand to\r\n    this wickedness, you should have suffered the army of the United\r\n    States to pass submissively through the Caudine Forks of Mexican\r\n    power,--to perish, it might be, like the legions of Varus. Their\r\n    bleached bones, in the distant valleys where they were waging\r\n    unjust war, would not tell to posterity such a tale of ignominy as\r\n    this lying Act of Congress.\r\n\r\n    Passing from the character and consequences of your vote, I proceed\r\n    to examine the grounds on which it is vindicated: for it is\r\n    vindicated, by yourself, and by some of your friends!\r\n\r\n    The first vindication, apology, or extenuation appears in your\r\n    speech on the Tariff, delivered in the House of Representatives,\r\n    June 25th. This was a deliberate effort, more than six weeks\r\n    subsequent to the vote, and after all the disturbing influences of\r\n    haste and surprise had passed. It may be considered, therefore,\r\n    to express your own view of the ground on which it is to be\r\n    sustained. And here, while you declare, with commendable\r\n    frankness, that you \"would by no means be understood to vindicate\r\n    the justice\" (why not say the _truth_?) \"of the declaration\r\n    that war exists by the act of Mexico,\" yet you adhere to your\r\n    vote, and animadvert upon the conduct of Mexico, in refusing to\r\n    receive a minister instead of a commissioner, as if that were a\r\n    vindication, apology, or extenuation! Do we live in a Christian\r\n    land? Is this the nineteenth century? Does an American statesman\r\n    venture any such suggestion in vindication, apology, or extenuation\r\n    of war? On this point I join issue. By the Law of Nations as\r\n    now enlightened by civilization, by the law of common sense, by\r\n    the higher law of Christian duty, the fact presented in your\r\n    vindication can form no ground of war. This attempt has given pain\r\n    to many of your constituents hardly less than the original vote.\r\n    It shows insensibility to the true character of war, and perverse\r\n    adherence to the fatal act of wrong. It were possible to suppose a\r\n    representative, not over-tenacious of moral purpose, shaken from\r\n    his firm resolve by the ardors of a tyrannical majority ordaining\r\n    wicked things; but it is less easy to imagine a deliberate\r\n    vindication of the hasty wrong, when the pressure of the majority\r\n    is removed, and time affords opportunity for the recovery of that\r\n    sense of Right which was for a while overturned.\r\n\r\n    Another apology, in which you and your defenders participate, is\r\n    founded on the alleged duty of voting succors to our troops, and\r\n    the impossibility of doing this without voting also for the bill,\r\n    after it was converted into a Declaration of Falsehood and of War.\r\n    It is said that patriotism required this vote. Is not that name\r\n    profaned by this apology? One of your honored predecessors, Sir,\r\n    a Representative of Boston on the floor of Congress, Mr. Quincy,\r\n    replied to such apology, when, on an occasion of trial not unlike\r\n    that through which you have just passed, he gave utterance to these\r\n    noble words:--\r\n\r\n    \"But it is said that this resolution must be taken as 'a test of\r\n    Patriotism.' To this I have but one answer. If Patriotism ask me\r\n    to assert a falsehood, I have no hesitation in telling Patriotism,\r\n    'I am not prepared to make that sacrifice.' The duty we owe to our\r\n    country is, indeed, among the most solemn and impressive of all\r\n    obligations; yet, high as it may be, it is nevertheless subordinate\r\n    to that which we owe to that Being with whose name and character\r\n    _truth_ is identified. In this respect I deem myself acting upon\r\n    this resolution under a higher responsibility than either to this\r\n    House or to this people.\"[194]\r\n\r\n    [194] Speech on the Resolution concerning the Conduct of the British\r\nMinister, Dec. 28, 1809: Annals of Congress, Eleventh Congress, Second\r\nSession, col. 958.\r\n\r\n    These words were worthy of Boston. May her Representatives never\r\n    more fail to feel their inspiration! \"But,\" say the too swift\r\n    defenders, \"Mr. Winthrop voted against the falsehood _once_.\"\r\n    Certainly no reason for not voting against it _always_. But the\r\n    excuse is still pressed, \"Succors to General Taylor should have\r\n    been voted.\" The result shows that even these were unnecessary.\r\n    Before the passage of this disastrous Act of Congress, his troops\r\n    had already achieved a success to which may be applied the words of\r\n    Milton:--\r\n\r\n              \"That _dishonest_ victory\r\n          At Chæronea, _fatal to liberty_.\"\r\n\r\n    But it would have been less wrong to leave him without succors,\r\n    even if needful to his safety, than to vote falsehood and unjust\r\n    war. In seeing that the republic received no detriment, you should\r\n    not have regarded the army only; _your highest care should have\r\n    been that its good name, its moral and Christian character,\r\n    received no detriment_. You might have said, in the spirit of\r\n    virtuous Andrew Fletcher, that \"you would lose your life to\r\n    _serve_ your country, but would not do a base thing to _save_\r\n    it.\" You might have adopted the words of Sheridan, in the British\r\n    Parliament, during our Revolution, that you \"could not assent to\r\n    a vote that seemed to imply a recognition or approbation of the\r\n    war.\"[195]\r\n\r\n    [195] Speech, Nov. 27, 1780: Hansard, Parl. Hist., XXI. 905.\r\n\r\n    Another apology is, that the _majority_ of the Whig party joined\r\n    with you,--or, as it has been expressed, that \"Mr. Winthrop voted\r\n    with all the rest of the weight of moral character in Congress,\r\n    from the Free States, belonging to the Whig party, _not included\r\n    in the Massachusetts delegation_\"; and suggestions are made in\r\n    disparagement of the _fourteen_ who remained unshaken in loyalty\r\n    to Truth and Peace. In the question of Right or Wrong, it is of\r\n    little importance that a few fallible men, constituting what\r\n    is called a majority, are all of one mind. Supple or insane\r\n    majorities are found in every age to sanction injustice. It was\r\n    a majority which passed the Stamp Act and Tea Tax,--which smiled\r\n    upon the persecution of Galileo,--which stood about the stake of\r\n    Servetus,--which administered the hemlock to Socrates,--which\r\n    called for the crucifixion of our Lord. These majorities cannot\r\n    make us hesitate to condemn such acts and their authors. Aloft on\r\n    the throne of God, and not below in the footprints of a trampling\r\n    multitude, are the sacred rules of Right, which no majorities can\r\n    displace or overturn. And the question recurs, Was it _right_ to\r\n    declare unjust and cowardly war, with superadded falsehood, in the\r\n    cause of Slavery?\r\n\r\n    Thus do I set forth the character of your act, and the apologies\r\n    by which it is shielded. I hoped that you would see the wrong, and\r\n    with true magnanimity repair it. I hoped that your friends would\r\n    all join in assisting you to recover the attitude of uprightness\r\n    which becomes a Representative from Boston. But I am disappointed.\r\n\r\n    I add, that your course in other respects has been in disagreeable\r\n    harmony with the vote on the Mexican War Bill. I cannot forget--for\r\n    I sat by your side at the time--that on the Fourth of July, 1845,\r\n    in Faneuil Hall, you extended the hand of fellowship to Texas,\r\n    although this slaveholding community was not yet received among the\r\n    States of the Union. I cannot forget the toast,[196] on the same\r\n    occasion, by which you were willing to connect your name with an\r\n    epigram of dishonest patriotism. I cannot forget your apathy at a\r\n    later day, when many of your constituents engaged in constitutional\r\n    efforts to oppose the admission of Texas _with a slaveholding\r\n    constitution_,--so strangely inconsistent with your recent avowal\r\n    of \"uncompromising hostility to all measures for introducing new\r\n    Slave States and new Slave Territories into our Union.\"[197] Nor\r\n    can I forget the ardor with which you devoted yourself to the less\r\n    important question of the Tariff,--indicating the relative value of\r\n    the two in your mind. The vote on the Mexican War Bill seems to be\r\n    the dark consummation of your course.\r\n\r\n    [196] \"Our country,--however bounded, still our country, to be defended\r\nby all our hands.\"\r\n\r\n    [197] Speech at the Whig Convention in Faneuil Hall, Sept. 23, 1846.\r\n\r\n    Pardon me, if I ask you, on resuming your seat in Congress, to\r\n    testify _at once_, without hesitation or delay, against the further\r\n    prosecution of this war. Forget for a while Sub-Treasury, Veto,\r\n    even Tariff, and remember this wicked war. With the eloquence\r\n    which you command so easily, and which is your pride, call for the\r\n    instant cessation of hostilities. Let your cry be that of Falkland\r\n    in the Civil Wars: \"Peace! Peace!\" Think not of what you call\r\n    in your speeches \"an _honorable_ peace.\" There can be no peace\r\n    with Mexico which will not be more honorable than this war. Every\r\n    fresh victory is a fresh dishonor. \"Unquestionably,\" you have\r\n    strangely said, \"we are not to forget that Mexico must be willing\r\n    to negotiate.\"[198] No! no! Mr. Winthrop! We are not to wait for\r\n    Mexico. Her consent is not needed; nor is it to be asked, while our\r\n    armies are defiling her soil by their aggressive footsteps. She\r\n    is _passive_. We alone are _active_. Stop the war. Withdraw our\r\n    forces. In the words of Colonel Washington, RETREAT! RETREAT! So\r\n    doing, we shall cease from further wrong, and peace will ensue.\r\n\r\n    [198] Speech at the Whig Convention, Sept. 23, 1846.\r\n\r\n    Let me ask you to remember in your public course the rules of Right\r\n    which you obey in private life. The principles of morals are the\r\n    same for nations as for individuals. Pardon me, if I suggest that\r\n    you have not acted invariably according to this truth. You would\r\n    not in your private capacity set your name to a falsehood; but you\r\n    have done so as Representative in Congress. You would not in your\r\n    private capacity countenance wrong, even in friend or child; but\r\n    as Representative you have pledged yourself \"not to withhold your\r\n    vote from any reasonable supplies which may be called for\"[199]\r\n    in the prosecution of a wicked war. Do by your country as by\r\n    friend or child. To neither of these would you furnish means of\r\n    offence against a neighbor; do not furnish to your country any such\r\n    means. Again, you would not hold slaves. I doubt not you would\r\n    join with Mr. Palfrey in emancipating any who should become yours\r\n    by inheritance or otherwise. But I do not hear of your effort or\r\n    sympathy with those who seek to carry into our institutions that\r\n    practical conscience which declares it to be as wrong in States as\r\n    in individuals to sanction slavery.\r\n\r\n    [199] Speech on the Tariff, June 25, 1846: Congressional Globe,\r\n    Twenty-ninth Congress, First Session, p. 970.\r\n\r\n    Let me ask you still further--and you will know if there is reason\r\n    for this request--to bear testimony against the Mexican War, and\r\n    all supplies for its prosecution, regardless of the minority in\r\n    which you are placed. Think, Sir, of the cause, and not of your\r\n    associates. Forget for a while the tactics of party, and all its\r\n    subtle combinations. Emancipate yourself from its close-woven web,\r\n    spun as from a spider's belly, and move in the pathway of Right.\r\n    Remember that you represent the conscience of Boston, the churches\r\n    of the Puritans, the city of Channing.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile a fresh election is at hand, and you are again a\r\n    candidate for the suffrages of your fellow-citizens. I shall\r\n    not anticipate their verdict. Your blameless private life and\r\n    well-known attainments will receive the approbation of all; but\r\n    more than one of your neighbors will be obliged to say,--\r\n\r\n                              \"Cassio, I love thee,\r\n                  But nevermore be officer of mine!\"\r\n\r\n                          I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                  CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n      OCTOBER 26, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                REFUSAL TO BE A CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n            NOTICE IN THE BOSTON PAPERS, OCTOBER 31, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n    After the appearance of Mr. Sumner's letter to Mr. Winthrop, there\r\n    was a disposition with certain persons feeling strongly on Slavery\r\n    and the Mexican War to seek a candidate against the latter. Mr.\r\n    Sumner again and again refused to accept a nomination. Besides\r\n    his constant unwillingness to enter into public life, he would\r\n    not consent that his criticism of Mr. Winthrop should be weakened\r\n    by the imputation of an unworthy desire for his place. In his\r\n    absence from Boston, lecturing before Lyceums in Maine, a meeting\r\n    of citizens was convened at the Tremont Temple on the evening\r\n    of October 29, 1846, to make what was called an \"independent\r\n    nomination for Congress.\" The meeting was called to order by Dr.\r\n    S.G. Howe, and organized by the choice of the following officers:\r\n    Hon. Charles F. Adams, President,--J.P. Blanchard, Samuel May,\r\n    George Merrill, Dr. Walter Channing, Dr. Henry I. Bowditch, and R.\r\n    I. Attwill, Vice-Presidents,--Charles G. Davis and J.H. Frevert,\r\n    Secretaries. A committee was appointed to draft resolutions and\r\n    nominate a candidate. This committee, by its chairman, John A.\r\n    Andrew, afterwards Governor of Massachusetts, reported an elaborate\r\n    series of resolutions, setting forth reasons for a separate\r\n    nomination, and concluding with a resolution in the following terms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That we recommend to the citizens of this District\r\n    as a candidate for Representative in the National Congress a man\r\n    raised by his pure character above reproach, whose firmness,\r\n    intelligence, distinguished ability, rational patriotism, manly\r\n    independence, and glowing love of liberty and truth entitle him to\r\n    the unbought confidence of his fellow-citizens,--CHARLES SUMNER, of\r\n    Boston,--fitted to adorn any station, always found on the side of\r\n    the Right, and especially worthy at the present crisis to represent\r\n    the interests of the city and the cardinal principles of Truth,\r\n    Justice, Liberty, and Peace, which have not yet died out from the\r\n    hearts of her citizens.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Mr. Andrew followed the reading of the resolutions with a speech,\r\n    in which he vindicated the position of Mr. Sumner as follows.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President, I shall have done no adequate justice to the views\r\n    of the committee, to this meeting, to the distinguished friend of\r\n    Peace and Liberty to whose nomination this crowded assembly has\r\n    with such gratifying and enthusiastic heartiness so unequivocally\r\n    responded, nor, indeed, to my own feelings, until I shall have made\r\n    a single statement of fact in regard to the attitude of Mr. Sumner\r\n    himself towards the act we have just felt it our duty to perform.\r\n\r\n    \"This nomination, grateful as it may be to his feelings, considered\r\n    as an evidence of personal attachment and respect on the part of\r\n    so many of his friends and fellow-citizens, will find him wholly\r\n    unprepared for its reception; more than that, as I myself do know,\r\n    he will hear of it with surprise and regret. Though I am unaware\r\n    that any member of the committee, other than myself, has had any\r\n    immediate personal knowledge of the views likely to be entertained\r\n    by him in this regard, I say, what no living man can truly dispute\r\n    or honestly question, that this nomination has been made upon the\r\n    entire responsibility and sense of duty of this committee,--not\r\n    only without the knowledge, approbation, or consent of Mr. Sumner,\r\n    but in the face of his constant, repeated, and determined refusal,\r\n    at all times, to allow his name, even for a moment, to be held at\r\n    the disposal of friends for such a purpose.\r\n\r\n    \"A delicate and sensitive appreciation of his attitude, as one of\r\n    the earliest, strongest, and most open of those opposed to the\r\n    dealings of our present member of Congress with the matter of the\r\n    Mexican War, determined Mr. Sumner, although looked to by--may I\r\n    not say every individual who sympathizes in this present movement\r\n    of opposition, as the man to bear our standard on the field of\r\n    controversy?--determined him to resist every effort to draw him\r\n    forth from the humblest station in our ranks.\r\n\r\n    \"He would think, write, and speak as his own mind and heart were\r\n    moved; but he would do nothing, he would permit nothing to be done,\r\n    for himself, for his own personal promotion.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Mr. Andrew then proceeded to mention what induced the committee to\r\n    disregard Mr. Sumner's known wishes.\r\n\r\n    The resolutions were adopted unanimously. A committee of vigilance\r\n    was appointed. Mr. Sumner's letter to Mr. Winthrop, with the report\r\n    of this meeting, signed by the President and Secretaries, was\r\n    printed on a broad-side.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile Mr. Sumner returned from Maine, when, on learning what\r\n    had passed, he at once withdrew his name in the following notice.\r\n\r\nLate last evening, on my return from Bangor, where I had been in\r\npursuance of an engagement made last August, I was surprised to find\r\nmyself nominated as candidate for Congress.\r\n\r\nI have never on any occasion sought or desired public office of any\r\nkind. I do not now. My tastes are alien to official life; and I have\r\nlong been accustomed to look to other fields of usefulness.\r\n\r\nMy name has been brought forward, in my absence, without any\r\nknowledge or suspicion on my part of such a purpose, and contrary to\r\nexpress declarations, repeatedly made, that I would not, under any\r\ncircumstances, consent to be a candidate.\r\n\r\nGrateful for the kindness of friends who have thought me worthy of\r\npolitical confidence, and regretting much that it is not bestowed\r\nupon some one else, who would fitly represent the idea of opposition\r\nto the longer continuance of the unjust war with Mexico, I beg leave\r\nrespectfully, but explicitly, to withdraw my name from the canvass.\r\n\r\n                                      CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n      SATURDAY, OCTOBER 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SLAVERY AND THE MEXICAN WAR.\r\n\r\n SPEECH AT A PUBLIC MEETING IN THE TREMONT TEMPLE, BOSTON, NOVEMBER 5,\r\n                                 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sentiment against Slavery and the Mexican War found expression\r\n    in the independent nomination of Dr. S.G. Howe as Representative to\r\n    Congress. At a meeting of citizens to support this nomination, John\r\n    A. Andrew, Esq., was called to the chair. The following resolution\r\n    was reported from the District Committee by John S. Eldridge, Esq.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That in the determination of our candidate, Dr.\r\n    SAMUEL G. HOWE, 'to stand and be shot at,' we recognize the spirit\r\n    of a man distinguished by a life of service in various fields\r\n    of humanity; and, confidently trusting in the triumph of sound\r\n    principles, we heartily pledge ourselves to make, with untiring\r\n    zeal, every honorable effort to secure the election of a candidate\r\n    who has boldly identified himself with the cause of Truth, Peace,\r\n    Justice, the Liberties of the North, and the Rights of Man.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    On this resolution Mr. Sumner made the speech given below. He was\r\n    followed by Hon. C.F. Adams, who reviewed the Anti-Slavery policy\r\n    pursued for several years by the Massachusetts Legislature, and the\r\n    obstacles they encountered.\r\n\r\n    At the election, which took place on Monday, November 9th, the vote\r\n    was as follows: Winthrop (Whig), 5,980; Howe (Anti-Slavery), 1,334;\r\n    Homer (Democrat), 1,688; Whiton (Independent), 331.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman,--When, in the month of July, 1830, the people of Paris\r\nrose against the arbitrary ordinances of Charles the Tenth, and, after\r\nthree days of bloody contest, succeeded in that Revolution which gave\r\nthe dynasty of Orléans to the throne of France, Lafayette, votary\r\nof Liberty in two hemispheres, placing himself at the head of the\r\nmovement, made his way on foot to the City Hall, through streets\r\nimpassable to carriages, filled with barricades, and strewn with wrecks\r\nof war. Moving along with a thin attendance, he was unexpectedly joined\r\nby a gallant Bostonian, who, though young in life, was already eminent\r\nby seven years of disinterested service in the struggle for Grecian\r\nindependence against the Turks, who had listened to the whizzing of\r\nbullets, and narrowly escaped the descending scimitar. Lafayette,\r\nconsiderate as brave, turned to his faithful friend, and said, \"Do not\r\njoin me; this is a danger for Frenchmen only; reserve yourself for your\r\nown country, where you will be needed.\" Our fellow-citizen heeded him\r\nnot, but continued by his side, sharing his perils. That Bostonian was\r\nDr. Howe. And now the words of Lafayette are verified. He is needed by\r\nhis country. At the present crisis, in our Revolution of \"Three Days,\"\r\nhe comes forward to the post of danger.\r\n\r\nI do not disguise the satisfaction I shall feel in voting for him,\r\nbeyond even the gratification of personal friendship, because he is\r\nnot a politician. His life is thickly studded with labors in the best\r\nof all causes, the good of man. He is the friend of the poor, the\r\nblind, the prisoner, the slave. Wherever there is suffering, there his\r\nfriendship is manifest. Generosity, disinterestedness, self-sacrifice,\r\nand courage have been his inspiring sentiments, directed by rare\r\nsagacity and intelligence; and now, wherever Humanity is regarded,\r\nwherever bosoms beat responsive to philanthropic effort, his name is\r\ncherished. Such a character reflects lustre upon the place of his\r\nbirth, far more than if he had excelled only in the strife of politics\r\nor the servitude of party.\r\n\r\nHe has qualities which especially commend him at this time. He is\r\nfirm, ever true, honest, determined, a lover of the Right. With a\r\ncourage that charms opposition, he would not fear to stand alone\r\nagainst a fervid majority. Knowing war by fearful familiarity, he is an\r\nearnest defender of peace. With a singular experience of life in other\r\ncountries, he now brings the stores he has garnered up, and his noble\r\nspirit, to the service of his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nBut we are assembled to-night less to consider his praises--grateful\r\nas these would be to me, who claim him as friend--than to examine the\r\nprinciples now in issue. Not names, but principles, are now in issue.\r\nProud as we may be of our candidate, we feel, and he too feels, that\r\nhis principles on the grave questions now pending are his truest\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nIn examining these questions, I shall regard those only which are put\r\nin issue by the Whigs. It is with the Whigs that I have heretofore\r\nacted, and may hereafter act,--always confessing loyalty to principles\r\nabove any party.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions of the recent Whig State Convention present five\r\ndifferent questions, with the opinions of the party thereupon. These\r\nare the Veto of the President, the Sub-Treasury, the Tariff, _Slavery_,\r\nand _the Mexican War_. Now, of these five questions, it will not be\r\ndisguised that the last two are the most important. Slavery is a\r\nwrong which justice and humanity alike condemn. The Mexican War is an\r\nenormity born of Slavery. Viewed as a question of dollars and cents,\r\nit overshadows the others; while the blackness of its guilt compels\r\nthem to the darkness of a total eclipse. Base in object, atrocious in\r\nbeginning, immoral in all its influences, vainly prodigal of treasure\r\nand life; it is a war of infamy, which must blot the pages of our\r\nhistory. No success, no bravery, no victory can change its character.\r\nVainly will our flag wave in triumph over twenty fields. Shame, and\r\nnot glory, will attend our footsteps, while, in the spirit of a bully,\r\nwe employ superior resources of wealth and numbers in carrying death\r\nand devastation to a poor, distracted, long afflicted sister republic.\r\nWithout disparaging the other questions, every just and humane person\r\nwill recognize Slavery and the Mexican War as paramount to all\r\nelse,--so much so, that whoever is wrong on these must be so entirely\r\nwrong as not to deserve the votes of Massachusetts men.\r\n\r\nThe Whig Convention has furnished a rule or measure of opinion. It has\r\nexpressly pledged the Whigs \"to promote all constitutional measures\r\nfor the overthrow of Slavery, and to oppose at all times, with\r\nuncompromising zeal and firmness, any further addition of slaveholding\r\nStates to this Union, out of whatever territory formed.\" The Mexican\r\nWar it has denounced as having its origin in _an invasion of Mexico by\r\nour troops_.\r\n\r\nNow on these subjects Dr. Howe's opinions are clear and explicit. He\r\nis an earnest, hearty, conscientious opponent of Slavery, and in his\r\nspeech at your former meeting he denounced the injustice of the Mexican\r\nWar, and, as a natural consequence, demanded the instant _retreat_ of\r\nGeneral Taylor's troops to the Nueces.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me to Mr. Winthrop. Here let me carefully disclaim\r\nany sentiment except of kindness towards him as a citizen. It is of\r\nMr. Winthrop the politician that I speak, and not of Mr. Winthrop the\r\nhonorable gentleman.\r\n\r\nAnd, _first_, what may we expect from him against _Slavery_? Will he\r\npromote all constitutional measures for its overthrow? Clearly one of\r\nthese is the Abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia. This\r\nis within the constitutional powers of Congress, and has been called\r\nfor expressly by our State. It has sometimes occurred to me that\r\nSlavery in our country is like the image in Nebuchadnezzar's dream,\r\nwhose feet of clay are in the District of Columbia, where they may\r\nbe shivered by Congressional legislation, directed by an enlightened\r\nNorthern sentiment, so that the whole image shall tumble to the earth.\r\nOther measures against Slavery are sanctioned by the Massachusetts\r\nWhigs, and by the Legislature of our State, in formal resolutions,\r\nduly transmitted to Washington. I have never heard of Mr. Winthrop's\r\nvoice for any of these,--nor, judging by the past, have I any reason to\r\nbelieve that he will support them earnestly. On these important points\r\nhe fails, if tried by Whig standards.\r\n\r\nWill he oppose, at all times, without compromise, any further addition\r\nof slaveholding States? Here again, if we judge him by the past, he is\r\nwanting. None can forget that in 1845, on the Fourth of July, a day\r\never sacred to memories of Freedom, in a speech at Faneuil Hall, he\r\nvolunteered, in advance of any other Northern Whig, to receive Texas\r\nwith a welcome into the family of States, although on that very day\r\nshe was preparing a Constitution placing Slavery beyond the reach of\r\nlegislative change.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is irresistible, that Mr. Winthrop cannot fitly\r\nrepresent the feeling palpitating in Massachusetts bosoms, and so often\r\nexpressed by our Legislature, with regard to Slavery.\r\n\r\nWhat may we expect from him as to the _Mexican War_? This brings me to\r\na melancholy inquiry, on which I am the less disposed to dwell because\r\nit has already been so fully considered. Will he ascend to the heights\r\nof a true civilization, and, while branding the war as unjust, call\r\nat once for its cessation, and the withdrawal of our forces? There is\r\nno reason to believe that he will. He voted for the Act of Congress\r\nunder which it is now waged, and by that disastrous vote made his\r\nconstituents partakers in a wicked and bloody war. At a later day,\r\nin an elaborate speech,[200] he vindicated his action, and promised\r\n\"not to withhold his vote from any reasonable supplies which may be\r\ncalled for\" in the prosecution of the war,--adding, that he should\r\nvote for them \"to enable the President to achieve that _honorable\r\npeace_ which he has solemnly promised to bring about at the earliest\r\npossible moment\" _by the sword_. And, pray, what is Mr. Winthrop's idea\r\nof an \"honorable peace\"? Is it peace imposed upon a weak neighbor by\r\nbrute force, the successful consummation of unrighteous war? Is it the\r\ntriumph of wrong? Is it the Saturnalia of Slavery? Is it the fruit of\r\nsin? Is it a baptism of blood unjustly shed? In the same speech, with\r\ngrievous insensibility to the sordid character of the suggestion, he\r\npleads for the maintenance of the old Tariff, as necessary to meet \"the\r\nexigencies\" of the Mexican War. \"In a time of war, like the present,\r\nmore especially,\" he says, \"_an ample revenue should be the primary\r\naim and end of all our custom-house duties_.\" Perish manufactures, let\r\nme rather say, if the duties by which they seem to be protected are\r\nswollen to feed \"the exigencies\" of unjust war! Afterwards, at Faneuil\r\nHall, before the Whig Convention, he shows a similar insensibility.\r\nNowhere does he sound the word _Duty_. Nowhere does he tell his country\r\nto begin by doing right. Nowhere does he give assurance of aid by\r\ncalling for the instant stay of the war.\r\n\r\n    [200] Speech on the Tariff, June 25, 1846.\r\n\r\nThere are those who, admitting that his vote was a mistake, say that\r\nwe are not to judge him on this account. Can we afford to send a\r\nrepresentative who can make such a mistake? But it is a mistake never\r\nby him acknowledged as such. It is still persisted in, and hugged.\r\nAmong the last words of warning from the lips of Chatham, as he fell at\r\nhis post in the British Senate, almost his dying words, were \"against\r\nco-operation with men who still persist in unretracted error.\"\r\n\r\nIn his vote for the Mexican War Mr. Winthrop was not a Whig. He then\r\nleft the party: for surely the party is not where numbers prevail, but\r\nwhere its principles are recognized. The true Whigs are the valiant\r\nminority of _fourteen_. Once in Roman history, the vestal fire, the\r\narchives, the sacred volumes of the Republic, were in the custody of a\r\nsingle individual, in a humble vehicle, fleeing from the burning city.\r\nWith him was the life of the Republic. So in that small minority was\r\nthe life of the Whig party, with its principles and its sacred fire.\r\n\r\nThe true Whig ground, the only ground consistent with professed loyalty\r\nto the sentiment of duty, is uncompromising opposition to the war,\r\nwheresoever and howsoever opposition may be made. Expecting right from\r\nMexico, we must begin by doing right. We are aggressors, and must cease\r\nto be so.\r\n\r\nThis is the proper course, having its foundations in immutable\r\nlaws. Let me repeat, that our country must do as an individual in\r\nlike circumstances. For, though politicians may disown it, there\r\nis but one rule for nations and for individuals. If any one of\r\nyou, fellow-citizens, finding yourself in dispute with a neighbor,\r\nhad unfortunately felled him to earth, but, with returning reason,\r\ndiscovered that you were wrong, what would you do? Of course, cease\r\ninstantly from _wrong-doing_. You would help your neighbor to his feet,\r\nand with awakened benevolence soothe his wounded nature. Precisely so\r\nmust our country do now. This can be only by the withdrawal of our\r\nforces. Peace would then follow. The very response sent to the Roman\r\nSenate by a province of Italy might be repeated by the Mexicans: \"The\r\nRomans, having preferred _justice_ to _conquest_, have taught us to be\r\nsatisfied with submission instead of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThat I may not found these conclusions upon general principles only, I\r\nwould invoke the example of English Whigs, Chatham, Camden, Burke, Fox,\r\nand Sheridan, in opposition to the war of our Revolution,--denouncing\r\nit at the outset as unjust, and ever, during its whole progress,\r\ndeclaring their condemnation of it,--voting against supplies for its\r\nprosecution, and against thanks for the military services by which it\r\nwas waged. Holding their example as of the highest practical authority\r\non the present question, and as particularly fit to be regarded by all\r\nprofessing to be Whigs in America, I make no apology for introducing\r\nthe authentic evidence which places it beyond doubt. This is to be\r\nfound in the volumes of the Parliamentary Debates. I am not aware that\r\nit has ever before been applied to the present discussion, although it\r\nis in every word especially applicable.\r\n\r\nI begin with that famous instance where two officers--one the son\r\nof Lord Chatham, and the other the Earl of Effingham--flung up their\r\ncommissions rather than fight against constitutional liberty as upheld\r\nby our fathers. In the case of the latter especially the sacrifice\r\nwas great; for he was bred to arms, and enjoyed the service. From his\r\nplace in the House of Lords, May 18, 1775, he vindicated his act in the\r\nfollowing terms.\r\n\r\n    \"Ever since I was of an age to have any ambition at all, my highest\r\n    has been to serve my country in a military capacity. If there was\r\n    on earth an event I dreaded, it was to see this country so situated\r\n    as to make that profession incompatible with my duty as a citizen.\r\n    That period is in my opinion arrived.... When the duties of a\r\n    soldier and a citizen become inconsistent, I shall always think\r\n    myself obliged to sink the character of the soldier in that of the\r\n    citizen, till such time as those duties shall again, by the malice\r\n    of our real enemies, become united.\"\r\n\r\nThese generous words found an echo at the time. A note in the\r\nParliamentary History says, \"The Twenty-second Regiment of Foot, in\r\nwhich he held a captain's commission, being ordered to America, he\r\nresolved, though not possessed of an ample patrimony, to resign a\r\ndarling profession, and all hopes of advancement, rather than bear\r\narms in a cause he did not approve\"; and the record proceeds to say\r\nthat \"the cities of London and Dublin voted him their thanks for this\r\nconduct.\"[201] If a soldier could bear testimony against an unjust war,\r\nit was easy for others not under the constraint of martial prejudice to\r\ndo so. The sequel shows how the example prevailed.\r\n\r\n    [201] Vol. XVIII., col. 688. See also Annual Register for 1776,\r\n    Vol. XIX. p. 42\r\n\r\nFirst came the famous Duke of Grafton, who, in the House of Lords,\r\non the Address of Thanks, October 26, 1775, after the Battles of\r\nLexington and Bunker Hill, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I pledge myself to your Lordships and my country, that, if\r\n    necessity should require it, and my health not otherwise permit it,\r\n    I mean to come down to this House in a litter, in order to express\r\n    my full and hearty disapprobation of the measures now pursuing,\r\n    and, as I understand from the noble Lords in office, meant to be\r\n    pursued. I do protest to your Lordships, that, if my brother or\r\n    my dearest friend were to be affected by the vote I mean to give\r\n    this evening, I could not possibly resist the faithful discharge\r\n    of my conscience and my duty. Were I to lose my fortune and every\r\n    other thing I esteem, were I to be reduced to beggary itself, the\r\n    strong conviction and compulsion at once operating on my mind\r\n    and conscience would not permit me to take any other part on the\r\n    present occasion than that I now mean to adopt.\"\r\n\r\nA protest at the close of this debate was signed by several peers,\r\ncontaining the following emphatic clause:--\r\n\r\n    \"Because we cannot, as Englishmen, as Christians, or as men of\r\n    common humanity, consent to the prosecution of a cruel civil war,\r\n    so little supported by justice, and so very fatal in its necessary\r\n    consequences, as that which is now waging against our brethren and\r\n    fellow-subjects in America.\"\r\n\r\nThis was echoed in the House of Commons, where, on the same Address,\r\nMr. Wilkes said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I call the war with our brethren in America an unjust, felonious\r\n    war.... I assert that it is a murderous war, because it is an\r\n    effort to deprive men of their lives for standing up in the just\r\n    cause of the defence of their property and their clear rights.\r\n    It becomes no less a murderous war with respect to many of our\r\n    fellow-subjects of this island; for every man, either of the navy\r\n    or army, who has been sent by Government to America, and fallen a\r\n    victim in this unnatural and unjust contest, has in my opinion been\r\n    murdered by Administration, and his blood lies at their door. Such\r\n    a war, I fear, Sir, will draw down the vengeance of Heaven upon\r\n    this devoted kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fox expressed himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"_He could not consent to the bloody consequences of so silly a\r\n    contest_ about so silly an object, conducted in the silliest manner\r\n    that history or observation had ever furnished an instance of, and\r\n    from which we were likely to derive nothing but poverty, misery,\r\n    disgrace, defeat, and ruin.\"\r\n\r\nHe was followed by the eminent lawyer, Serjeant Adair:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am against the present war, because I think it unjust in its\r\n    commencement, injurious to both countries in its prosecution, and\r\n    ruinous in its event.... I think, from the bottom of my soul, that\r\n    the Colonies are engaged in a noble and glorious struggle.... Sir,\r\n    I could not be easy in my own mind without entering the strongest\r\n    and most public protestations against measures which appear to me\r\n    to be fraught with the destruction of this mighty empire. _I wash\r\n    my hands of the blood of my fellow-subjects_, and shall at least\r\n    have this satisfaction, amidst the impending calamities of the\r\n    public, not only to think that I have not contributed to, but that\r\n    I have done all in my power to oppose and avert, the ruin of my\r\n    country.\"\r\n\r\nDuring another debate in the Lords, November 15, 1775, that strenuous\r\nfriend of freedom and upholder of Whig principles, Lord Camden,\r\ndeclared himself thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Peace is still within our power; nay, we may command it. A\r\n    suspension of arms on our part, if adopted in time, will secure\r\n    it for us, and, I may add, on our own terms. _From which it is\r\n    plain, as we have been the original aggressors in this business,\r\n    if we obstinately persist, we are fairly answerable for all the\r\n    consequences._ I again repeat, what I often urged before, that I\r\n    was against this unnatural war from the beginning. I was equally\r\n    against every measure, from the instant the first tax was proposed\r\n    to this minute. When, therefore, it is insisted that we aim only\r\n    to defend and enforce our own rights, I positively deny it. I\r\n    contend that America has been driven by cruel necessity to defend\r\n    her rights from the united attacks of violence, oppression,\r\n    and injustice. I contend that America has been indisputably\r\n    aggrieved.... I must still think, and shall uniformly continue to\r\n    assert, that Great Britain was the aggressor, that most, if not\r\n    all, the acts were founded in oppression, and that, if I were an\r\n    American, I should resist to the last such manifest exertion of\r\n    tyranny, violence, and injustice.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, in the Commons, December 8, 1775, Mr. Fox\r\nexpressed himself thus sententiously:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have always said that the war carrying on against the Americans\r\n    is unjust.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in the Lords, March 5, 1776, the Earl of Effingham said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I never can stand up in your Lordships' presence without throwing\r\n    in a few words on the justice of this unnatural war.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Commons, March 11, 1776, Colonel Barré, Mr. Burke, Mr. Fox, all\r\nvied in eulogy of General Montgomery, the account of whose death before\r\nQuebec had arrived a few days before.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit was constantly manifest. In the Commons, April 24,\r\n1776, in the debate on the Budget, embodying taxes to carry on the\r\nwar against America, Mr. Fox laid down the constitutional rule of\r\nopposition to an unjust war.\r\n\r\n    \"To the resolutions he should give his flat negative, and that\r\n    not because of any particular objections to the taxes proposed\r\n    (although there might be a sufficient ground for urging many),\r\n    _but because he could not conscientiously agree to grant any money\r\n    for so destructive, so ignoble a purpose as the carrying on a war\r\n    commenced unjustly, and supported with no other view than to the\r\n    extirpation of freedom_ and the violation of every social compact.\r\n    THIS HE CONCEIVED TO BE THE STRICT LINE OF CONDUCT TO BE OBSERVED\r\n    BY A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT.... He then painted the quarrel with\r\n    America as unjust, and the pursuance of the war as blood-thirsty\r\n    and oppressive.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Barré followed, and adopted the phrase of Mr. Fox, \"giving his\r\nflat negative to the resolutions, _as they were calculated to tax the\r\nsubject for an unjust purpose_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Grafton, in the Lords, October 31, 1776, repeated the\r\nsentiments he had avowed at an earlier day.\r\n\r\n    \"He pledged himself to the House, and to the public, that, while he\r\n    had a leg to stand on, he would come down day after day to express\r\n    the most marked abhorrence of the measures hitherto pursued, and\r\n    meant to be adhered to, in respect to America.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same night, in the Commons, Mr. Fox exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n    \"The noble Lord who moved the amendment said that we were in the\r\n    dilemma of _conquering or abandoning America. If we are reduced to\r\n    that, I am for abandoning America._\"\r\n\r\nIn the Commons, November 6, 1776, Mr. Burke likened England to a \"cruel\r\nconqueror.\"\r\n\r\n    \"You simply tell the Colonists to lay down their arms, and then\r\n    you will do just as you please. Could the most cruel conqueror say\r\n    less? Had you conquered the Devil himself in Hell, could you be\r\n    less liberal?\"\r\n\r\nColonel Barré, in the Commons, February 10, 1777, insisted:--\r\n\r\n    \"America must be reclaimed, _not conquered or subdued_.\r\n    Conciliation or concession are the only sure means of either\r\n    gaining or retaining America.\"\r\n\r\nThe Budget came up again in the Commons, May 14, 1777, when Mr. Burke\r\nspoke nobly:--\r\n\r\n    \"He was, and ever would be, ready to support a just war, whether\r\n    against subjects or alien enemies; but where justice, or a color of\r\n    justice, was wanting, he should ever be the first to oppose it.\"\r\n\r\nAll these declarations were crowned by Lord Chatham's motion in the\r\nLords, May 30, 1777, to put a stop to American hostilities, when he\r\nspoke so wisely and bravely.\r\n\r\n    \"We have tried for unconditional submission: _try what can be\r\n    gained by unconditional redress_.... We are the aggressors. We have\r\n    invaded them. We have invaded them as much as the Spanish Armada\r\n    invaded England.... In the sportsman's phrase, when you have found\r\n    yourselves at fault, _you must try back_.... I shall no doubt\r\n    hear it objected, 'Why should we submit or concede? Has America\r\n    done anything, on her part, to induce us to agree to so large a\r\n    ground of concession?' I will tell you, my Lords, why I think\r\n    you should. _You have been the aggressors from the beginning....\r\n    If, then, we are the aggressors, it is your Lordships' business\r\n    to make the first overture._ I say again, this country has been\r\n    the aggressor. You have made descents upon their coasts; you have\r\n    burnt their towns, plundered their country, made war upon the\r\n    inhabitants, confiscated their property, proscribed and imprisoned\r\n    their persons. _I do therefore affirm, that, instead of exacting\r\n    unconditional submission from the Colonies, we should grant them\r\n    unconditional redress._ We have injured them; we have endeavored\r\n    to enslave and oppress them. Upon this clear ground, instead of\r\n    chastisement, they are entitled to redress.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Lord Chatham broke out, November 18, 1777, in words most\r\napplicable to the present occasion.\r\n\r\n    \"I would sell my shirt off my back to assist in proper measures,\r\n    properly and wisely conducted; _but I would not part with a single\r\n    shilling to the present ministers_. Their plans are founded\r\n    in destruction and disgrace. It is, my Lords, a ruinous and\r\n    destructive war; it is full of danger; it teems with disgrace, and\r\n    must end in ruin.... If I were an American, as I am an Englishman,\r\n    while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I never would lay\r\n    down my arms!--never!--never!--never!\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Richmond, in the Lords, on the same occasion, returned to\r\nthe charge in a similar spirit.\r\n\r\n    \"Can we too soon put a stop to such a scene of carnage? My Lords, I\r\n    know that what I am going to say is not fashionable language; but\r\n    a time will come when every one of us must account to God for his\r\n    actions, and how can we justify causing so many innocent lives to\r\n    be lost?\"\r\n\r\nIn the Commons, December 5, 1777, Mr. Hartley, the constant friend of\r\nAmerica, brought forward a motion:--\r\n\r\n    \"That it is unbecoming the wisdom and prudence of Parliament to\r\n    proceed any farther in the support of this fruitless, expensive,\r\n    and destructive war, more especially without any specific terms of\r\n    accommodation declared.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Rockingham, in the Lords, February 16, 1778, exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n    \"He was determined to serve his country _by making peace at any\r\n    rate_.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, in the Lords, March 23, 1778, the Duke of Richmond brought\r\nforward a motion for the withdrawal of the forces from America.\r\n\r\nThe same question was presented again in the Commons, November 27,\r\n1780, on a motion to thank General Clinton and others for their\r\nmilitary services in America, when Mr. Wilkes laid down the true rule.\r\n\r\n    \"I think it my duty to oppose this motion, because in my idea\r\n    every part of it conveys an approbation of the American War,--a\r\n    war unfounded in principle, and fatal in its consequences to this\r\n    country.... _Sir, I will not thank for victories which only tend\r\n    to protract a destructive war...._ As I reprobate the want of\r\n    principle in the origin of the American War, I the more lament all\r\n    the spirited exertions of valor and the wisdom of conduct which in\r\n    a good cause I should warmly applaud. Thinking as I do, I see more\r\n    matter of grief than of triumph, of bewailing than thanksgiving, in\r\n    this civil contest, and the deluge of blood which has overflowed\r\n    America.... I deeply lament that the lustre of such splendid\r\n    victories is obscured and darkened by the want of a good cause,\r\n    without which no war, in the eye of truth and reason, before God or\r\n    man, can be justified.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fox followed in similar strain.\r\n\r\n    \"He allowed the merits of the officers now in question, but he made\r\n    a distinction between thanks and praise. He might, admire their\r\n    valor, but he could not separate the intention from the action;\r\n    they were united in his mind; there they formed one whole, and he\r\n    would not attempt to divide them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan joined in these declarations.\r\n\r\n    \"There were in that House different descriptions of men _who\r\n    could not assent to a vote that seemed to imply a recognition or\r\n    approbation of the American War_.\"\r\n\r\nAll these words are memorable from the occasion of their utterance,\r\nfrom the statesmen who uttered them, and from the sentiments avowed.\r\nThe occasion was the war of Great Britain upon our fathers. The\r\nstatesmen were the greatest masters of political wisdom and eloquence\r\nthat England has given to the world. The sentiments were all in harmony\r\nwith what I have urged on the present occasion. Orators contended with\r\neach other in the strength of their language. Lord Camden averred that\r\n\"Great Britain was the aggressor.\" The Duke of Grafton declared, that,\r\n\"while he had a leg to stand on,\" he would express his \"abhorrence\" of\r\nthe war. Chatham gave utterance to the same sentiment in one of his\r\nmost magnificent orations. And Wilkes, Sheridan, Fox, and Burke echoed\r\nthis strain, all insisting that the war was unjust, and must therefore\r\nbe stopped.\r\n\r\nThus far I have quoted testimony from Parliamentary debates on our own\r\nRevolution; but going farther back, we find similar authority. When\r\nCharles the First sent assistance to the French against the Huguenots\r\nin Rochelle, the officers and men did more than murmur; and here our\r\nauthority is Hume. The commander of one of the ships \"declared that he\r\nwould rather be hanged in England for disobedience than fight against\r\nhis brother Protestants in France.\"[202]\r\n\r\n    [202] Hume, History of England, Chap. L.\r\n\r\nThey went back to the Downs. Having received new orders, they sailed\r\nagain for France.\r\n\r\n    \"When they arrived at Dieppe, they found that they had been\r\n    deceived. Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who commanded one of the vessels,\r\n    broke through and returned to England. All the officers and sailors\r\n    of all the other ships, notwithstanding great offers made them by\r\n    the French, immediately deserted. One gunner alone preferred duty\r\n    towards his king to the cause of religion, and he was afterwards\r\n    killed in charging a cannon before Rochelle.\"[203]\r\n\r\n    [203] Hume, History of England, Chap. L.\r\n\r\nThe same sentiment prevailed also in the war upon Spain by Cromwell,\r\nwhen several naval officers, having scruples of conscience with regard\r\nto the justice of the war, threw up their commissions and retired. Here\r\nagain Hume is our authority.\r\n\r\n    \"No commands, they thought, of their superiors could justify a war\r\n    which was contrary to the principles of natural equity, and which\r\n    the civil magistrate had no right to order. Individuals, they\r\n    maintained, in resigning to the public their natural liberty, could\r\n    bestow on it only what they themselves were possessed of, a right\r\n    of performing lawful actions, and could invest it with no authority\r\n    of commanding what is contrary to the decrees of Heaven.\"[204]\r\n\r\n    [204] Ibid., Chap. LXI.\r\n\r\nHere again it is soldiers who refuse to fight in unjust war.\r\n\r\nSuch is the doctrine of morals sanctioned by English examples. Such\r\nshould be the doctrine of an American statesman. If we apply it to\r\nthe existing exigency, or try the candidates by this standard, we\r\nfind, that, as Dr. Howe is unquestionably right, so Mr. Winthrop is\r\ntoo certainly wrong. Exalting our own candidate, I would not unduly\r\ndisparage another. It is for the sake of the cause in which we are\r\nengaged, by the side of which individuals dwindle into insignificance,\r\nthat we now oppose Mr. Winthrop, bearing our testimony against Slavery\r\nand the longer continuance of the Mexican War, demanding the retreat of\r\nGeneral Taylor and the instant withdrawal of the American forces. Even\r\nif we seem to fail in this election, we shall not fail in reality. The\r\ninfluence of this effort will help to awaken and organize that powerful\r\npublic opinion by which this war will at last be arrested.\r\n\r\nHang out, fellow-citizens, the white banner of Peace; let the\r\ncitizens of Boston rally about it; and may it be borne forward by an\r\nenlightened, conscientious people, aroused to condemnation of this\r\nmurderous war, until Mexico, now wet with blood unjustly shed, shall\r\nrepose undisturbed beneath its folds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       INVALIDITY OF ENLISTMENTS\r\n\r\n   IN THE MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT OF VOLUNTEERS FOR THE MEXICAN WAR.\r\n\r\n  ARGUMENT BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS, JANUARY, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n    By the Mexican War Bill (approved May 13, 1846) the President was\r\n    authorized \"to call for and accept the services of any number\r\n    of volunteers, not exceeding fifty thousand,\" and provision was\r\n    made for their organization. The Governor of Massachusetts, by\r\n    proclamation, called for a Regiment in this Commonwealth, which\r\n    was organized under the Act of Congress. Before it had left the\r\n    Commonwealth, applications for discharge were made to the Supreme\r\n    Court of Massachusetts in behalf of several persons repenting\r\n    their too hasty enlistment. At the hearing, the proceedings by\r\n    which the Regiment had been organized were called in question.\r\n    Their validity was denied on the ground that the Act of Congress,\r\n    in some of its essential provisions concerning volunteers, was\r\n    unconstitutional,--that the enlistments were not in conformity\r\n    with the Act,--and also that the militia laws of Massachusetts had\r\n    been fraudulently used in forming the regiment. These points, and\r\n    the further question, whether a minor is bound by his contract of\r\n    enlistment under the Act, were argued by Mr. Sumner, who appeared\r\n    as counsel for one of the petitioners. The Court sustained the\r\n    validity of the proceedings, but discharged the minors.--See _In\r\n    Re_ Kimball, Murray, and Stone, 9 Law Reporter, 500, where the case\r\n    is reported.\r\n\r\n  MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONORS,\r\n\r\nThis cause has a strong claim upon the careful consideration of the\r\nCourt. It comes with a _trinoda necessitas_, a triple cord, to bind its\r\njudgment. It is important as respects the parties, the public, and the\r\nprinciples involved.\r\n\r\nTo the _parties_, it is one of the highest questions known to the\r\nlaw, being a question of _human freedom_. It is proposed to hold the\r\npetitioner in the servitude of the army for an indefinite space of\r\ntime, namely, \"for the duration of the war with Mexico.\" During all\r\nthis period, he will be subject to martial law, and to the Articles of\r\nWar, with the terrible penalties of desertion. He will be under the\r\ncommand of officers, at whose word he must move from place to place\r\nbeyond the confines of the country, and perform unwelcome duties,\r\ninvolving his own life and the lives of others.\r\n\r\nTo the _public_, it is important, as it is surely of especial\r\nconsequence, in whose hands is placed the power of life and death. The\r\nsoldier is vested with extraordinary attributes. He is at times more\r\nthan marshal or sheriff. He is also surrounded by the law with certain\r\nimmunities, one of which is exemption from imprisonment for debt.\r\n\r\nIt is important from the _principles_ involved. These are the\r\ndistinctions between the different kinds of military force under the\r\nConstitution of the United States, the constitutionality of the Act\r\nof Congress of May, 1846, and the legality of the enlistments under\r\nit. The determination of these questions will establish or annul the\r\nimmense and complex Volunteer System now set in motion.\r\n\r\nIn a case of such magnitude, I shall be pardoned for dwelling carefully\r\nupon the different questions. In the course of my argument I hope to\r\nestablish the following propositions.\r\n\r\n_First._ That the forces contemplated by the Act of May, 1846, are a\r\npart of the \"army\" of the United States, or its general military force,\r\nand not of the \"militia.\"\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ That the part of the Act of Congress of 1846 providing\r\nfor the officering of the companies is unconstitutional, and the\r\nproceedings thereunder are void.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ That the present contract is illegal, inasmuch as it is not\r\naccording to the terms of the Statute, which prescribes that it shall\r\nbe for \"twelve months or the war,\" whereas it is \"for the war\" only.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly._ That it is illegal, being entered into by an improper use\r\nof the militia laws of Massachusetts, so as to be a _fraud_ on those\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly._ That minors cannot be held by contract of enlistment under\r\nthe present Act.\r\n\r\nI shall now consider these different propositions.\r\n\r\n_First._ The force contemplated by the Act of May, 1846, is a part of\r\nthe _army_ of the United States, or of its general military force, and\r\nnot of the _militia_.\r\n\r\nIt is called \"volunteers\"; but on inquiry it will appear that it\r\nhas elements _inconsistent_ with militia, while it wants elements\r\n_essential_ to militia.\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to consider what these elements are, it will be\r\nproper, first, to consider the powers of Congress over the land forces.\r\nCongress is not omnipotent, like the British Parliament. It can do only\r\nwhat is permitted by the Constitution of the United States, and _in the\r\nmanner permitted_. We are, then, to search the Constitution.\r\n\r\nHere we find two different species of land forces, and only two. These\r\nare \"armies\" and \"militia.\" There is between the two no hybrid or\r\nheteroclite,--no _tertium quid_.\r\n\r\nThese forces are referred to and sanctioned by the following clauses,\r\nand by no others: \"The Congress shall have power _to raise and support\r\narmies_; to provide for calling forth _the militia_ to execute the\r\nlaws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions; to\r\nprovide for organizing arming, and disciplining _the militia_, and for\r\ngoverning such part of them as may be employed in the service of the\r\nUnited States, _reserving to the States, respectively, the appointment\r\nof the officers_, and the authority of training the militia, according\r\nto the discipline prescribed by Congress.\" (Art. I. § 8.) And again:\r\n\"The President shall be commander-in-chief of the _army_ and navy of\r\nthe United States, and of _the militia of the several States, when\r\ncalled into the actual service of the United States_.\" (Art. II. § 2.)\r\n\r\nIt has been ably argued by Mr. Lanier, in the Virginia Assembly,\r\nthat the distinction between _army_ and _militia_ is, that the first\r\nstands on _contract_ or _voluntary enlistment_, and the second on _the\r\nlaw compelling parties to serve_; that this simple test determines\r\nthe character of the service, Did the party enter _voluntarily_ or\r\nby _operation of law_? If voluntarily, then he is in the \"army\"; if\r\ncompulsorily, or by operation of law, then he is in the \"militia.\"\r\nThis distinction is palpable, and is true, I think, beyond question,\r\nwith regard to the \"army\" and \"militia\" under existing laws. I am\r\nnot prepared to say that Congress, under the clause authorizing it\r\n\"to raise and support armies,\" may not, following the example of\r\nother countries, enforce a conscription, or levy, which shall act\r\ncompulsorily throughout the country, being in this respect like the\r\n_militia_, although unlike it in other respects. Such a plan was\r\nrecommended by Mr. Monroe, when Secretary of War, October 17, 1814, who\r\nspeaks of it as follows.\r\n\r\n    \"The limited power which the United States have in organizing the\r\n    militia may be urged as an argument against their right to raise\r\n    _regular troops in the mode proposed_. If any argument could be\r\n    drawn from that circumstance, I should suppose that it would be in\r\n    favor of an opposite conclusion. The power of the United States\r\n    over the militia has been limited, and that for raising regular\r\n    armies granted without limitation. There was, doubtless, some\r\n    object in this arrangement. The fair inference seems to be, that it\r\n    was made on great consideration,--that the limitation in the first\r\n    instance was intentional, the consequence of the unqualified grant\r\n    of the second.\r\n\r\n    \"But it is said, that by drawing the men from the militia service\r\n    into the regular army and putting them under regular officers you\r\n    violate a principle of the Constitution _which provides that the\r\n    militia shall be commanded by their own officers_. If this was the\r\n    fact, the conclusion would follow. But it is not the fact. The men\r\n    are not drawn from the militia, but from the population of the\r\n    country. _When they enlist voluntarily, it is not as militia-men\r\n    that they act, but as citizens._ If they are drafted, it must be in\r\n    the same sense. In both instances they are enrolled in the militia\r\n    corps; but that, as is presumed, cannot prevent the voluntary\r\n    act in one instance or the compulsive in the other. The whole\r\n    population of the United States, within certain ages, belong to\r\n    these corps. If the United States could not form regular armies\r\n    from them, they could raise none.\"[205]\r\n\r\n    [205] Niles's Register, Vol. VII. p. 139: November 5, 1814.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Monroe's views are sound, the \"army\" of the United States,\r\nas well as the \"militia,\" may be raised by draft. It may consist of\r\n_regulars_ and _irregulars_.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be the powers of Congress on this subject, it is\r\ncertain that there is no legislation now in force, providing for the\r\n\"army,\" except by means of _voluntary enlistment_. The whole army\r\nof the United States is, at present, an army of _volunteers_; and\r\nall persons who are _volunteers_ are of the _army_, and not of the\r\n_militia_. To call them _volunteers_ does not take them out of the\r\ncategory of the _army_, or general military force of the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the _militia_, when in the service of the United\r\nStates _as militia_, are not _volunteers_. They come by draft or\r\nconscription. This distinction is derived from England, to whom we\r\nare indebted for so much of our jurisprudence, and so many principles\r\nof constitutional law. We find from Blackstone (Vol. I. p. 412), that\r\nthe English militia consists of \"the inhabitants of the county, chosen\r\nby lot for three years.\" They are called \"the constitutional security\r\nwhich the laws have provided for the public peace and for protecting\r\nthe realm against foreign or domestic violence\"; and \"they are _not\r\ncompellable to march out of their counties, unless in case of invasion\r\nor actual rebellion within the realm, nor in any case compellable to\r\nmarch out of the kingdom_.\" They are \"officered by the lord-lieutenant,\r\nthe deputy-lieutenants, and other principal landholders, under a\r\ncommission from the crown.\" It will be observed, from this description,\r\nthat there are four distinct elements in the English militia. 1.\r\nIt is in its nature a draft or conscription. 2. It is local in its\r\ncharacter. 3. It is officered by persons in the county. 4. It can be\r\ncalled out only on peculiar exigencies, expressly designated. In all\r\nthese respects it is distinguishable from what is called the _army_ of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke somewhere says that nearly half of the early editions of\r\nBlackstone's Commentaries found their way to America. The framers of\r\nour Constitution were familiar with this work, and they have reproduced\r\nall these four features of the English militia, substituting \"State\"\r\nfor \"county,\" and adopting even the peculiar exigencies when they are\r\ncompellable to march \"out of the State.\" Thus following Blackstone,\r\nthey have recognized an \"_army_\" and a \"_militia_,\" without any third\r\nor intermediate military body.\r\n\r\nThis same distinction between the militia and army was recognized by\r\nMr. Charles Turner, in the British Parliament, in a speech on the Bill\r\nfor embodying the Militia, November 2, 1775. \"The proper men,\" he says,\r\n\"_to recruit and supply your troops_ are the scum and outcast of cities\r\nand manufactories: fellows who _voluntarily submit to be slaves_ by an\r\napprenticeship of seven years are the proper persons to be military\r\nones. But to take the honest, sober, industrious fellow from the plough\r\nis doing an essential mischief to the community, and laying a double\r\ntax.\"[206]\r\n\r\n    [206] Hansard, Parl. Hist., Vol. XVIII. col. 846.\r\n\r\nLet us now apply these general considerations to the present case.\r\n\r\nThe Act of May, 1846, recognizes a clear distinction between _militia_\r\nand _volunteers_. It authorizes the President \"to employ the _militia_,\r\nnaval, and military forces of the United States, and to call for and\r\naccept the services of any number of _volunteers_, not exceeding fifty\r\nthousand, ... to serve twelve months after they shall have arrived\r\nat the place of rendezvous, or to the end of the war, unless sooner\r\ndischarged.\" The next section (§ 2) provides that \"the _militia_, when\r\ncalled into the service of the United States by virtue of this Act or\r\nany other Act, may, if in the opinion of the President of the United\r\nStates the public interest requires it, be compelled to serve _for a\r\nterm not exceeding six months_ after their arrival at the place of\r\nrendezvous.\" The ninth section speaks of \"militia or volunteers,\"\r\nreferring to the two distinct classes.\r\n\r\nNow on the face of this Act there are at least two distinct\r\nrecognitions that \"volunteers\" are not of the _militia_: 1st, in\r\nproviding for the employment of _volunteers_ and also of _militia_,\r\ntreating the two as distinct; and, 2d, in providing that the service\r\nfor volunteers shall be \"twelve months or the war,\" while that of the\r\nmilitia is \"six months\" only.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons. 1st, The volunteers do not come by draft, but\r\nby contract. 2d, Then, again, the President is expressly empowered to\r\napportion the staff, field, and general officers among the respective\r\nStates and Territories from which the volunteers shall tender their\r\nservices, while, in the supplementary Act of June 26, major-generals\r\nand brigadier-generals are to be appointed by the President by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, all of which, notwithstanding\r\nthe sop to the States in the apportionment provision, is inconsistent\r\nwith the character of _militia_. 3d, Another reason why these cannot\r\nbe _militia_ is, that no such exigency has occurred as authorizes the\r\nPresident to call for the militia,--as, for instance, \"to execute the\r\nlaws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.\"\r\n\r\nThus far I have sought to bring the proposed body of volunteers to the\r\ntouchstone of the Constitution and laws of the United States. Let us\r\nnow see how they conform to the Constitution and laws of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n1. By the Constitution of Massachusetts, the Governor is\r\ncommander-in-chief of the militia; but he cannot command these\r\nvolunteers.\r\n\r\n2. By our State laws (Chap. 92, March 24, 1840) volunteers in the\r\nmilitia are \"to do duty for five years\", while volunteers under the Act\r\nin question are for \"twelve months or the war.\"\r\n\r\n3. \"A uniform such as the commander-in-chief shall prescribe\" is\r\nappointed for the volunteer militia, while volunteers under the Act are\r\nsubject to no such regulation.\r\n\r\n4. The statute of 1846, chap. 218, § 10, provides that each company\r\nshall have \"one first, one second, one third, and one fourth\r\nlieutenant.\" Mr. Secretary Marcy's requisition (p. 30 of Mr. Cushing's\r\nReport[207]) allows to each company \"one first lieutenant and two\r\nsecond lieutenants.\"\r\n\r\n    [207] Mass. House Doc. 1847, No. 7.\r\n\r\nBy provisions like these Massachusetts has marked her militia that\r\nshe may know them. She tells them how they shall be apparelled and\r\nofficered. But the body now called out is so apparelled and officered\r\nthat the Commonwealth cannot recognize it as her militia.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear, that, in the light of the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States, and also of the Constitution and laws of Massachusetts,\r\nthis body cannot be a part of the _militia_.\r\n\r\nBut it is suggested on the other side that the companies now raised may\r\nbe regarded as companies of militia who _volunteer as companies_ into\r\nthe army of the United States; and it is urged that the requisitions\r\nof the Constitution are complied with, inasmuch as the officers of\r\nthe regiment are commissioned by the Governor. To this it may be\r\nreplied, that the militia of the Commonwealth have certain specific\r\nduties detailed in the statute on the subject (Chap. 92, 1840). For\r\ninstance (§ 23), three parades in each year, and inspection on the\r\nlast Wednesday of May; (§ 24) an inspection and review in each year;\r\n(§ 27) and particularly to aid the _posse comitatus_ in case of riot.\r\nThese all contemplate that they shall remain _at home_. Now it is not\r\nto be questioned, that, in any of the _exigencies_ mentioned by the\r\nConstitution, they may be ordered from home, _in the manner prescribed\r\nby the Constitution and laws_; but it certainly cannot be allowable\r\nfor a company of militia to VOLUNTEER _as a company_ into a service\r\n_inconsistent with the duties prescribed by the laws under which it is\r\nestablished_. Adopting Mr. Monroe's distinction, the individuals can\r\nvolunteer _as citizens_, but not _as a company_.\r\n\r\nLet us try this point by an analogy. The Commonwealth by its\r\nlegislation (Rev. Stat., chap. 18) establishes companies of engine-men,\r\nwho are to be appointed by the selectmen of towns, to protect from\r\nfires. Is it supposed that these companies can volunteer, _as\r\ncompanies_, to enter the army of the United States, and go far away\r\nfrom the scene of the duties for which they were established? But\r\nthe companies of militia are hardly less local and home-abiding in\r\ncharacter than the companies of engine-men. It is impossible to suppose\r\nthat they can volunteer as companies into the \"army\" of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBut suppose, for the sake of argument, that companies of militia, as\r\nsuch, may volunteer into the service of the United States, under the\r\nAct of May, 1846,--do they continue to be _militia_? Clearly not. They\r\nare in no wise subject to the laws of Massachusetts. Her Governor,\r\nwho was so unfortunately prompt to put them in motion, cannot recall\r\nthem, although he is commander-in-chief of her militia. They have not\r\nher uniform. Their officers are not her officers, but officers of the\r\nUnited States. The corps has become part of the _army_ of the United\r\nStates, or of its general military force.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the legal character of the present Massachusetts Regiment,\r\nif it have any _legal character_.\r\n\r\n  \"If shape it may be called, that shape has none\r\n  Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb,\r\n  Or substance may be called that shadow seems.\"\r\n\r\nIt is part of the \"army\" of the United States, and not of the \"militia.\"\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ It being established that it is not of the _militia_, but\r\nof the _army_, the way is prepared for the consideration of the other\r\nquestions. The first of these relates to the _constitutionality_ of\r\npart of the Act under which the regiment is raised. Looking at Captain\r\nWebster's return in the present case, it will be perceived that he\r\nclaims to hold the petitioner \"because the said Samuel A. Stone has\r\nbeen duly enrolled and enlisted as a member of Company A of the First\r\nRegiment of Massachusetts Infantry, whereof the said Edward Webster\r\nhas been duly commissioned Captain by his Excellency the Governor\r\nof this Commonwealth.\" On this return we have a question of double\r\naspect. 1. Has Edward Webster a right to detain the petitioner? 2. Is\r\nthe petitioner liable to be detained by anybody? It is possible that\r\nthe petitioner may be liable, although Edward Webster has no right to\r\ndetain him. In other words, he may be legally enlisted as a soldier\r\nin the \"army\" of the United States, although Webster is not a legal\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, is Edward Webster legally commissioned as \"an officer of\r\nthe United States\"? This is an important question, which concerns the\r\nvalidity of his acts. He should be anxious to know if he is a legal\r\nofficer, that he may not bear the sword in vain. The attributes of a\r\nmilitary officer are of a high order. He has power over human life and\r\nproperty to an extraordinary degree. He has power at once executive\r\nand judicial; he is sheriff and judge. In these peculiar powers he\r\nis distinguishable from common citizens. Such powers the Government\r\ncan impart,--but only in certain ways _precisely prescribed_ by the\r\nConstitution and laws,--only constitutionally, legally, and rightfully.\r\nAnd the question recurs, Have these powers been imparted in such wise\r\nto Edward Webster?\r\n\r\nThis is determined by the Constitution of the United States. That\r\ninstrument provides explicitly the manner of appointing \"officers\r\nof the United States.\" It says (Art. 2, § 2), \"The President shall\r\nnominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall\r\nappoint, ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court, _and all other officers of the United States_ whose\r\nappointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be\r\nestablished by law; but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of\r\nsuch _inferior officers_ as they think proper in the President alone,\r\nin the courts of law, or in the in the heads of departments.\" In the\r\nnext clause it declares, that \"the President shall have power to fill\r\nup all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, _by\r\ngranting commissions_ which shall expire at the end of their next\r\nsession.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these clauses it appears that all \"officers of the United States\"\r\nare nominated, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\r\nare appointed, by the President; and it is inferred that they are\r\n\"commissioned\" by the President.\r\n\r\nNow two questions arise: whether an officer in the \"army\" of the\r\nUnited States is an \"officer of the United States\" in the sense of the\r\nConstitution, and whether he is an \"inferior officer.\"\r\n\r\nHe is not an \"inferior officer\" in the sense of the Constitution; for\r\nhis appointment has never been vested \"in the President alone, in the\r\ncourts of law, or in the heads of departments.\"\r\n\r\nHe is an \"officer of the United States.\" In support of this is\r\nuniversal custom, which has always treated him as such, the express\r\naction of President Monroe and Congress in 1821 with regard to the\r\noffice of Adjutant-General (3 Story, Com. on Const. § 1531, note), and\r\nsundry precedents.\r\n\r\nI conclude, therefore, that Edward Webster, assuming to be an \"officer\r\nof the United States,\" but not having been \"nominated by the President,\r\nand by and with the advice and consent of the Senate appointed,\" nor\r\nbeing \"commissioned\" by the President, is not constitutionally an\r\nofficer of the \"army\" of the United States, nor entitled to detain the\r\npetitioner. He is commissioned by the Governor of Massachusetts, who\r\ncannot give any power in the \"army\" of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe question next arises, whether any person is authorized to detain\r\nthe petitioner. Webster is not. Who is?\r\n\r\nThe petitioner has been mustered into the service of the United States,\r\nnot as an individual citizen, but _as a member of the company of which\r\nWebster assumes to be captain_. If the company has no legal existence\r\nas a company, all the proceedings are void. But the company becomes\r\nsuch only through its officers. Until its officers are chosen, it is\r\nan embryo, not a legal body. But its officers never have been chosen\r\nin any constitutional way. The company is, therefore, still unborn. Or\r\nrather, to adopt the illustration of the Roman Tribune, the \"belly\"\r\nis produced, but the \"head and hands\" are wanting; so that it is\r\nimpossible to present a complete body.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is, that the petitioner is not liable to be\r\nheld in the service of the United States. This stands upon the\r\n_unconstitutionality_ of that part of the law of Congress relating to\r\nthe peculiar organization of this corps.\r\n\r\nThis same error Congress has committed before. The Act of February 24,\r\n1807 (Statutes at Large, Vol. II. p. 419), provides for volunteers\r\nin companies, \"whose commissioned officers shall be appointed in the\r\nmanner prescribed by law in the several States and Territories to which\r\nsuch companies shall respectively belong.\" In the Act of February 6,\r\n1812 (Statutes at Large, Vol. II. p. 676), these words are repeated.\r\nBut at a later day it seems the mistake was discovered. By the Act\r\nof January 27, 1815, it is provided (§ 4) \"that the officers of the\r\nsaid volunteers shall be commissioned by the President of the United\r\nStates\"; and also (§ 8) \"that the appointment of the officers of the\r\nsaid volunteers, if received into the service of the United States for\r\nthe term of twelve months, or for a longer term, shall be submitted to\r\nthe Senate, for their advice and consent, at their next session after\r\ncommissions for the same shall have been issued.\" This bill was much\r\nconsidered in Congress.[208] Notwithstanding all this, the same error\r\nis repeated in the Act of May, 1846.\r\n\r\n    [208] See Niles's Register, Vol. VII. pp. 313, 333, 352.\r\n\r\nI submit, that it will be the duty of the Court to declare the Act of\r\nMay, so far as it relates to the organization of the _volunteers_,\r\nunconstitutional, and all the proceedings under it a nullity.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ But if the law should be regarded as constitutional, it is\r\nfurther submitted that the proceedings under it in Massachusetts have\r\nbeen _illegal_ in two respects: _first_, by the action of the National\r\nGovernment; and, _secondly_, by the action of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAt present we will consider the illegality on the part of the National\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Act of May provides for volunteers \"to serve twelve months after\r\nthey shall have arrived at the place of rendezvous, or to the end of\r\nthe war, unless sooner discharged.\" But by the requisition of Mr.\r\nSecretary Marcy they are to serve \"during the war with Mexico, unless\r\nsooner discharged,\" which is a different term from that in the law.\r\n\r\nThe right to enlist soldiers is determined by the laws. Its exact\r\nextent is measured there. It is not dependent upon the judgment or\r\nconscience of any Secretary,--as if his foot were the standard of\r\nphysical measure. The law expressly says, that the enlistment is to be\r\nfor \"twelve months or the war.\" Now it cannot have been the intention\r\nof Congress to obtain enlistments for the indefinite period of the\r\nwar,--for ten years, like the Trojan War, or thirty years, like that\r\nof Wallenstein, in Germany. They wished to hold volunteers for twelve\r\nmonths, or even for a shorter time, if the war should be ended sooner;\r\nand at the time of this untoward Act it was supposed that it would be\r\nended sooner. The militia, in this Act, are called out for \"six months\"\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of February 24, 1807 (Statutes at Large, Vol. II. p. 419),\r\nthe volunteers are \"for the term of twelve months after they shall\r\nhave arrived at the place of rendezvous, unless sooner discharged\";\r\nand for the same term by the Act of February 6, 1812 (Vol. II. p.\r\n676). But by the Act of February 24, 1814 (Vol. III. p. 98), the term\r\nwas \"five years, or during the war.\" By the Act of January 27, 1815\r\n(Vol. III. p. 193), the term was \"not less than twelve months.\" By\r\nthe Act of January 27, 1814 (Vol. III. p. 94), the term of soldiers\r\nin the regular army was \"five years, or during the war.\" I mention\r\nthese precedents, to show that this question may have arisen before,\r\nalthough we have no reports of it from any judicial tribunal. But\r\nwe have the express opinion of the late Mr. Justice Johnson, of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, in a note to his elaborate Life of\r\nGeneral Greene, written not long after the Acts of Congress to which\r\nI have referred. It was printed in 1822. He says: \"The point on which\r\nthe Pennsylvania line really grounded their revolt was the same which\r\nhas been more recently much agitated between the American Government\r\nand its army. The soldiers were enlisted for a certain number of years,\r\n_or the war_. At the expiration of the term of years they demanded\r\ntheir discharge; and after resisting this just claim, and sustaining\r\nall the terrors and real dangers of a revolt, ... the Government was\r\nobliged to acquiesce. _For so many years or the war_ certainly meant\r\nfor that time, if the war should so long last. Else why specify a term\r\nof years?--as enlistments for the war would have expressed the sense of\r\nthe contracting parties.\" (Vol. II. p. 53, note.)\r\n\r\nOn the authority of Mr. Justice Johnson, the question seems to be\r\nclear. But if there be any doubt, the inclination must be against the\r\nGovernment. They are the powerful and intelligent party; the soldier\r\nis powerless and ignorant. The Government are the inviting, offering,\r\npromising party. To them applies the rule, _Verba fortius accipiuntur\r\ncontra proferentem._[209]\r\n\r\n    [209] Bacon, Maxims of the Law, Reg. III.\r\n\r\nBut it is said on the other side, that the \"twelve months\" have not yet\r\nexpired; and it does not follow that the volunteers will be detained\r\nbeyond that period. But the case now is to be judged on the _contract_.\r\nIs the contract legal or illegal, under the Act of Congress? It is\r\nsubmitted that it is illegal.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly._ I submit that the proceedings in Massachusetts under the\r\nAct of March are _illegal_, inasmuch as they are a _fraud_ upon the\r\nmilitia laws of the Commonwealth. This brings me to a part of the case\r\nhumiliating to Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen the purpose of these laws, contemplating the\r\nperformance of duties _at home_,--as, in preserving the peace, and\r\naiding the _posse comitatus_. These purposes are distinctly declared\r\nby the Legislature. (Chap. 92, 1840.) But by the agency of State\r\nofficers these laws have been employed--I would say, prostituted--to\r\na purpose widely different: not to help preserve the peace at home,\r\nbut to destroy peace abroad. It appears from the communication of the\r\nAdjutant-General, that he resorted to the device or invention of using\r\nthe militia laws of the State in order to enlist soldiers to make war\r\non Mexico. The following is the form of an application to be organized\r\nas a company of the Massachusetts militia,--the applicant expressly\r\nsetting forth objects inconsistent with the duties of the militia.\r\n\r\n                                         \"CHARLESTOWN, January 4, 1847.\r\n\r\n    \"_To His Excellency, George N. Briggs, Governor and\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts._\r\n\r\n    \"SIR,--The undersigned, in behalf of himself and his associates,\r\n    whose names are duly enrolled therefor, respectfully requests that\r\n    they may be duly organized as a company, to be annexed to the First\r\n    Regiment of Massachusetts Infantry: _it being understood, that,\r\n    when so organized, they desire and assent to be placed at the\r\n    disposal of the President of the United States, to serve during the\r\n    existing war with Mexico_. And as in duty bound will ever pray.\r\n\r\n                          (Signed,)      \"JOHN S. BARKER.\"\r\n\r\nThus the Executive of the Commonwealth placed all the apparatus and\r\nenergy of the Adjutant-General, and of the militia laws, at the\r\nservice of certain petitioners, well knowing that these persons were\r\nnot to enlist _bona fide_ in the honest militia of Massachusetts, but\r\nwith the distinct understanding that they should be placed at the\r\ndisposal of the President of the United States, to serve during the\r\nexisting war with Mexico. I do not complain that the Governor or the\r\nAdjutant-General lent himself officially or personally to this purpose,\r\nthough I have my regrets on this score; but I do complain that _the\r\nlaws of Massachusetts_ are prostituted to this purpose.\r\n\r\nIt has been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, in\r\n_Prigg_ v. _Pennsylvania_, (16 Peters, 539), that State officers are\r\nnot obliged to enforce United States laws. The Nation must execute\r\nits laws by its own officers. Under the lead of this decision, the\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts passed a law making it penal for State\r\nofficers to arrest or detain in public buildings any person for the\r\nreason that he is claimed as a fugitive slave (Act of 1843, Chap.\r\n69), although the Act of Congress of 1793 contemplates the action of\r\nState officers. By this legislation Massachusetts has clearly shown\r\nher determination to take advantage of the principle in Prigg's case.\r\nThe Governor and the Adjutant-General, not heeding the spirit of our\r\nCommonwealth, made themselves _recruiting officers_ of the United\r\nStates, as much as if they had enlisted sailors for the ship-of-war\r\nOhio, now lying in our harbor.\r\n\r\nHow much soever this may be deplored, it forms no ground for any\r\nlegal questioning of their acts. What they did, under the directions\r\nof an Act of Congress, as _agents_ of the United States, would be\r\nlegal, provided it was not forbidden by the laws of the State. But\r\nalthough they might volunteer as _agents_ of the United States in\r\nraising troops for the Mexican War, acting under the law of Congress,\r\n_they cannot employ the State laws for this purpose_. They cannot\r\nbe justified in _diverting_ the laws of the State to purposes not\r\noriginally contemplated by these laws, and _inconsistent with their\r\nwhole design and character_. Such was the employment of the militia\r\nlaws of Massachusetts. These laws have been made by the Executive the\r\ninstruments, the \"decoy-ducks,\" to get together the Falstaff regiment\r\nwhose existence is now drawn in question. The whole proceeding is a\r\n_fraud_ on those laws.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of this Court, as conservators of the laws of the\r\nCommonwealth, bound to see that they receive no detriment, to guard\r\nthem from such a perversion from their true and original purpose. This\r\ncan be done only by annulling the proceedings that have taken place\r\nunder them.\r\n\r\nSuch are the objections to the legal character of the Massachusetts\r\nRegiment. If either of these should prevail, then the whole regiment\r\nis virtually dissolved. It becomes a mere name. _Stat nominis umbra._\r\nOr it is left a mere voluntary association, without that quickening\r\nprinciple which is necessary to a military organization under the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States. It is like the monster\r\nFrankenstein, the creation of audacious human hands, endowed with a\r\nhuman form, but wanting a soul.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly._ But suppose the Court should hesitate to pronounce the\r\nnullity of these proceedings, and should recognize the legal existence\r\nof the regiment, it then becomes important to determine whether there\r\nare any special circumstances in the case of the petitioner which will\r\njustify his discharge. The party that I represent is a _minor_, and\r\nas such entitled to his discharge. The question on this point I have\r\nreserved to the last, because I wished to consider it after the inquiry\r\nwhether the regiment was a part of the \"army\" or the \"militia,\" in\r\norder to disembarrass it of considerations that might arise from the\r\ncircumstance that the militia laws embrace minors. I assume now that\r\nthe regiment, if it have any legal existence, is a part of the \"army.\"\r\n\r\nThe jurisprudence of all countries wisely provides a certain period of\r\nmajority, at which persons are supposed to be able to make contracts.\r\nThis by the Common Law is the age of twenty-one.\r\n\r\nNow enlistment in the army of the United States is a _contract_. The\r\nparties are volunteers, and the term implies contract. And the question\r\narises, whether this contract is governed by the Common Law, so as\r\nto be voidable when made by a minor. Is the circumstance that the\r\ncontract is made with the Government any ground of exception? If an\r\ninfant were to contract with the Government to sell a piece of land,\r\nhe would not be bound by it any more than if the contract were with a\r\nprivate person. Is the circumstance that the contract is _military_ any\r\nground of exception? If an infant were to contract to furnish military\r\nsupplies to Government, he could not be held more than by any private\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThe rule of the Common Law as to the incapacity of infants is specific.\r\nAn exception to it must be established by express legislation,--as,\r\nin the case of capacity to make a will, to marry, or to serve in the\r\nmilitia. Congress has recognized this principle by expressly declaring,\r\non several occasions, that persons between the ages of eighteen and\r\ntwenty-one may be enlisted. The argument from this is clear, that\r\nwithout _express provision_ such enlistments would not be binding. The\r\nActs of January 11, 1812 (Statutes at Large, Vol. II. p. 671), and\r\nDecember 10, 1814 (Ibid., Vol. III. p. 146), contain such provisions.\r\nAnd we are able from contemporary history to ascertain what was\r\nthe understanding concerning them. I refer particularly to Niles's\r\nRegister, Vol. III. p. 207, and the discussion there on the first of\r\nthese Acts; also to Vol. VII. p. 308, where will be found an important\r\ndocument making this legislation of Congress a special subject of\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nIt is argued, however, that the United States have no Common Law,\r\nand cannot, therefore, be governed by the rules of majority therein\r\nestablished. Although it may be decided that the United States have no\r\nCommon Law as a source of jurisdiction, yet it cannot be questioned\r\nthat they have a Common Law so far as may be necessary in determining\r\nthe signification of words and the capacity of persons. Idiots and\r\nfemes-coverts would not be held as _volunteers_ in the army of the\r\nUnited States; but their capacity is determined by the Common Law, and\r\nnot by any special legislation.\r\n\r\nI conclude, therefore, that the contract of enlistment in this regiment\r\nmay be avoided by a minor.\r\n\r\nIt may be in the power of the Court to discharge the petitioner without\r\npassing upon all the grave questions which I have now presented. But I\r\nconfidently submit, that, if these proceedings are unconstitutional and\r\nillegal, as I have urged, if the regiment is a nullity, as I believe,\r\nthe truth should be declared. The regiment is soon to embark for\r\nforeign war, when its members will be beyond the kindly protection of\r\nthis Court. It will be for the Court to determine whether it may not,\r\nby a just judgment, vindicate the injured laws of Massachusetts, and\r\ndischarge many fellow-citizens from obligations imposed in violation of\r\nthe Constitution and laws of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICAN TROOPS FROM MEXICO.\r\n\r\n SPEECH AT A PUBLIC MEETING IN FANEUIL HALL, BOSTON, FEBRUARY 4, 1847.\r\n\r\n    Hon. Samuel Greele presided at this meeting. The other speakers,\r\n    besides Mr. Sumner, were Rev. James Freeman Clarke, Hon. John M.\r\n    Williams, Rev. Theodore Parker, Elizur Wright, and Dr. Walter\r\n    Channing. There was interruption at times from lawless persons\r\n    trying to drown the voice of the speaker. One of the papers\r\n    remarks, that \"a number of the volunteers were among the most\r\n    active.\"\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,--\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1775, five years after what was called the \"massacre\"\r\nin King Street, now State Street, a few months only before the Battles\r\nof Lexington and Bunker Hill, Boston was occupied by a British army\r\nunder General Gage,--as Mexican Monterey, a town not far from the size\r\nof Boston in those days, is now occupied by American troops under\r\nGeneral Taylor. The people of Boston felt keenly all the grievance of\r\nthis garrison, holding the control of Massachusetts Bay with iron hand.\r\nWith earnest voice they called for its withdrawal, as the beginning of\r\nreconciliation and peace. Their remonstrances found unexpected echo in\r\nthe House of Lords, when Lord Chatham, on the 20th of January, brought\r\nforward his memorable motion for the withdrawal of the troops from\r\nBoston. Josiah Quincy, Jr., dear to Bostonians for his own services,\r\nand for the services of his descendants in two generations, was present\r\non this occasion, and has preserved an interesting and authentic\r\nsketch of Lord Chatham's speech. From his report I take the following\r\nimportant words.\r\n\r\n    \"There ought to be no delay in entering upon this matter. We ought\r\n    to proceed to it immediately. We ought to seize the first moment\r\n    to open the door of reconciliation. The Americans will never be in\r\n    a temper or state to be reconciled,--they ought not to be,--till\r\n    the troops are withdrawn. The troops are a perpetual irritation\r\n    to these people; they are a bar to all confidence and all cordial\r\n    reconcilement. I, therefore, my Lords, move, 'That an humble\r\n    address be presented to His Majesty, most humbly to advise and\r\n    beseech His Majesty, that, in order to open the way towards an\r\n    happy settlement of the dangerous troubles in America, by beginning\r\n    to allay ferments and soften animosities there, and above all for\r\n    preventing in the mean time any sudden and fatal catastrophe at\r\n    Boston, now suffering under the daily irritation of an army before\r\n    their eyes, posted in their town, it may graciously please His\r\n    Majesty _that immediate orders may be despatched to General Gage\r\n    for removing His Majesty's forces from the town of Boston_, as soon\r\n    as the rigor of the season, and other circumstances indispensable\r\n    to the safety and accommodation of the said troops, may render the\r\n    same practicable.'\"[210]\r\n\r\n    [210] Life of Josiah Quincy, Jr., p. 320.\r\n\r\nIt is to promote a similar measure of justice and reconciliation\r\nthat we are now assembled. Adopting the language of Chatham, we ask\r\nthe cessation of this unjust war, and the withdrawal of the American\r\nforces from Mexico, \"as soon as the rigor of the season, and other\r\ncircumstances indispensable to the safety and accommodation of the said\r\ntroops, may render the same practicable.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this movement will extend throughout the country,\r\nbut it is proper that it should begin here. Boston herself in former\r\ntimes suffered. The war-horse was stalled in one of her most venerable\r\nchurches. Her streets echoed to the tread of hostile troops. Her\r\ninhabitants were waked by the morning drum-beat of oppressors. On their\r\nown narrow peninsula they have seen the smoke of an enemy's camp.\r\nThough these things are beyond the memory of any in this multitude, yet\r\nfaithful History has entered them on her record, so that they can never\r\nbe forgotten. It is proper, then, that Boston, mindful of the past and\r\nof her own trials, mindful of her own pleadings for the withdrawal of\r\nthe British troops, as the beginning of reconciliation, should now\r\ncome forward and ask for _others_ what she once so earnestly asked for\r\n_herself_. It is proper that Boston should confess her obligations to\r\nthe generous eloquence of Chatham, by vindicating his arguments of\r\npolicy, humanity, and justice, in their application to the citizens\r\nof a sister Republic. Franklin, in dispensing a charity, said to the\r\nreceiver, \"When you are able, return this,--not to me, but to some one\r\nin need, like yourself now.\" In the same spirit, Boston should now\r\nrepay her debt by insisting on the withdrawal of the American troops\r\nfrom Mexico.\r\n\r\nOther considerations call upon her to take the lead. Boston has always\r\nled the generous actions of our history. Boston led the cause of the\r\nRevolution. Here commenced that discussion, pregnant with independence,\r\nwhich, at first occupying a few warm, but true spirits only, finally\r\nabsorbed all the best energies of the continent, the eloquence of\r\nAdams, the patriotism of Jefferson, the wisdom of Washington. Boston is\r\nthe home of noble charities, the nurse of true learning, the city of\r\nchurches. By all these tokens she stands conspicuous; and other parts\r\nof the country are not unwilling to follow her example. Athens was\r\ncalled \"the eye of Greece.\" Boston may be called \"the eye of America\";\r\nand the influence which she exerts proceeds not from size,--for\r\nthere are other cities larger far,--but from moral and intellectual\r\ncharacter. It is only just, then, that a town foremost in the struggles\r\nof the Revolution, foremost in all the humane and enlightened labors of\r\nour country, should take the lead now.\r\n\r\nThe war in which the United States are engaged has been from this\r\nplatform pronounced unconstitutional. Such was the judgment of him who\r\nhas earned the title of _Defender of the Constitution_. Would that,\r\ninstead of innocuous threat to impeach its alleged author, he had\r\nspoken in the spirit of another time, when, branding an appropriation\r\nas unconstitutional, he boldly said he would not vote for it, if the\r\nenemy were thundering at the gates of the Capitol!\r\n\r\nAssuming that the war commenced in violation of the Constitution, we\r\nhave ample reason for its arrest on this account alone. Of course the\r\ntroops should be withdrawn to where they were, when, in defiance of the\r\nConstitution, they moved upon disputed territory.\r\n\r\nBut the war is not only unconstitutional, it is unjust, and it is vile\r\nin object and character. It had its origin in a well-known series of\r\nmeasures to extend and perpetuate Slavery. It is a war which must ever\r\nbe odious in history, beyond the outrages of brutality which disgrace\r\nother nations and times. It is a slave-driving war. In principle it is\r\nonly a little above those miserable conflicts between barbarian chiefs\r\nof Central Africa to obtain slaves for the inhuman markets of Brazil.\r\nSuch a war must be accursed in the sight of God. Why is it not accursed\r\nin the sight of man?\r\n\r\nWe are told that the country is engaged in the war, and therefore\r\nit must be maintained, or, as it is sometimes expressed, vigorously\r\nprosecuted. In other words, the violation of the Constitution and the\r\noutrage upon justice sink out of sight, and we are urged to these same\r\nacts again. By what necromancy do these pass from wrong to right?\r\nIn what book of morals is it written, that what is bad before it is\r\nundertaken becomes righteous merely from the circumstance that it is\r\ncommenced? Who on earth is authorized to transmute wrong into right?\r\nWhoso admits the unconstitutionality and injustice of the war, and yet\r\nsanctions its prosecution, must approve the Heaven-defying sentiment,\r\n\"Our country, right or wrong.\" Can this be the sentiment of Boston? If\r\nso, in vain are her children nurtured in the churches of the Pilgrims,\r\nin vain fed from the common table of knowledge bountifully supplied by\r\nour common schools. Who would profess allegiance to wrong? Who would\r\ndeny allegiance to right? Right is one of the attributes of God, or\r\nrather it is part of his Divinity, immortal as himself. The mortal\r\ncannot be higher than the immortal. Had this sentiment been received\r\nby our English defenders in the war of the Revolution, no fiery tongue\r\nof Chatham, Burke, Fox, or Camden would have been heard in our behalf.\r\nTheir great testimony would have failed. All would have been silenced,\r\nwhile crying that the country, right or wrong, must be carried through\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nHere is a gross confusion of opposite duties in cases of _defence_ and\r\nof _offence_. When a country is invaded, its soil pressed by hostile\r\nfootsteps, its churches desecrated, its inhabitants despoiled of\r\nhomes, its national life assailed, then the indignant spirit of a free\r\npeople rises to repel the aggressor. Such an occasion challenges all\r\nthe energies of _self-defence_. It has about it all that dismal glory\r\nwhich can be earned in scenes of human strife. But if it be right to\r\npersevere in _defence_, it must be wrong to persevere in _offence_. If\r\nthe Mexicans are right in defending their homes, we certainly are wrong\r\nin invading them.\r\n\r\nThe present war is _offensive_ in essence. As such it loses all shadow\r\nof title to support. The acts of courage and hardihood which in a just\r\ncause might excite regard, when performed in an unrighteous cause, have\r\nno quality that can commend them to virtuous sympathy. The victories of\r\naggression and injustice are a grief and shame. Blood wrongfully shed\r\ncries from the ground drenched with the fraternal tide.\r\n\r\nThe enormous expenditures lavished upon this war, now extending to\r\nfifty millions of dollars,--we have been told recently on the floor\r\nof the Senate that they were near one hundred millions,--are another\r\nreason for its cessation. The soul sickens at the contemplation of this\r\nincalculable sum diverted from purposes of usefulness and beneficence,\r\nfrom railroads, colleges, hospitals, schools, and churches, under whose\r\ngenial influences the country would blossom as a rose, and desecrated\r\nto the wicked purposes of unjust war. In any righteous self-defence\r\neven these expenditures would be readily incurred. The saying of an\r\nearly father of the Republic, which roused its enthusiasm to unwonted\r\npitch, was, \"Millions for Defence, not a cent for Tribute.\" Another\r\nsentiment more pertinent to our times would be, \"Not a cent for\r\nOFFENCE.\"\r\n\r\nAnd why is this war to be maintained? According to the jargon of the\r\nday, \"to conquer a peace.\" But if we ask for peace in the spirit of\r\npeace, we must begin by doing justice to Mexico. We are the aggressors.\r\nWe are now in the wrong. We must do all in our power to set ourselves\r\nright. This surely is not by brutal effort to conquer Mexico. Our\r\nmilitary force is so far greater than hers, that even conquest must be\r\nwithout the wretched glory which men covet, while honor is impossible\r\nfrom successful adherence to original acts of wrong. \"To conquer a\r\npeace\" may have a sensible signification, when a nation is acting in\r\n_self-defence_; but it is base, unjust, and atrocious, when the war\r\nis of _offence_. Peace in such a war, if founded on conquest, must be\r\nthe triumph of injustice, the consummation of wrong. It is unlike that\r\ntrue peace won by justice or forbearance. It cannot be sanctioned by\r\nthe God of Christians. To the better divinities of heathenism it would\r\nbe offensive. It is of such a peace that the Roman historian, whose\r\npen is as keen as a sword's sharp point, says, \"_Auferre, trucidare,\r\nrapere, falsis nominibus_, IMPERIUM; _atque, ubi solitudinem faciunt_,\r\nPACEM _appellant_\": With lying names, they call spoliation, murder,\r\nand rapine, _Empire_; and when they have produced the desolation of\r\nsolitude, they call it _Peace_.[211]\r\n\r\n    [211] Tacitus, Agricola, c. 30.\r\n\r\nThe present course of our country, I have said, is opposed to those\r\nprinciples which govern men in private life. Few, if any, of the\r\nconspicuous advocates for the maintenance of this war would hesitate,\r\nif found wrong in any private transaction, to _retreat_ at once. With\r\nproper apology they would repair their error, while they recoiled from\r\nthe very suspicion of perseverance. Such should be the conduct of\r\nthe Nation; for it cannot be said too often, that the general rules\r\nof morals are the same for individuals and states. \"A commonwealth,\"\r\nsays Milton, \"ought to be but as one huge Christian personage, one\r\nmighty growth and stature of an honest man, as big and compact in\r\nvirtue as in body. For look what the grounds and causes are of single\r\nhappiness to one man, the same ye shall find them to a whole state; by\r\nconsequence, therefore, that which is good and agreeable to the state\r\nwill appear soonest to be so by being good and agreeable to the true\r\nwelfare of every Christian, and that which can be justly proved hurtful\r\nand offensive to every true Christian will be evinced to be alike\r\nhurtful to the state.\"[212]\r\n\r\n    [212] Of Reformation in England, Book II.: Prose Works, Vol. I. p.\r\n    29.\r\n\r\nI adopt the sentiments of Milton, and ask, Is not perseverance\r\nin wrong-doing hurtful and offensive to every Christian? Is not\r\nperseverance in wrong-doing hurtful and offensive to every Christian\r\ncommonwealth? And is it not doubly so, when the opposite party is weak\r\nand the offender strong?\r\n\r\nThere are other considerations, arising from our fellowship with\r\nMexico, which plead for her. She is our neighbor and sister republic,\r\nwho caught her first impulse to independence from our example,\r\nrejecting the ensigns of royalty to follow simpler, purer forms. She\r\nhas erred often, and suffered much, under the rule of selfish and bad\r\nmen. But she is our neighbor and sister still, entitled to the rights\r\nof neighborhood and sisterhood. Many of her citizens are well known in\r\nour country, where they established relations of respect and amity.\r\nOne of them, General Almonte, her recent minister at Washington, was a\r\nfavored guest in the social circles of the capital. He is personally\r\nknown to many who voted the supplies for this cruel war upon his\r\ncountry. The representative from Boston refers to him in terms of\r\npersonal regard. Addressing any of these friends, how justly might this\r\nMexican adopt the words of Franklin, in his remarkable letter to Mr.\r\nStrahan, of the British Parliament!\r\n\r\n                                          \"PHILADELPHIA, 5 July, 1775.\r\n\r\n    \"MR. STRAHAN,--You are a member of Parliament, and one of that\r\n    majority which doomed my country to destruction. You have begun to\r\n    burn our towns and murder our people. _Look upon your hands: they\r\n    are stained with the blood of your relations!_ You and I were long\r\n    friends: you are now my enemy, and I am yours,\r\n\r\n                                              \"B. FRANKLIN.\"[213]\r\n\r\n    [213] Works, ed. Sparks, Vol. VIII. p. 155.\r\n\r\nThe struggle in Mexico against the United States, and that of our\r\nfathers against England, have their points of resemblance. Prominent\r\namong these is the aggressive character of the proceedings, in the\r\nhope of crushing a weaker people. But the parallel fails as yet in\r\nan important particular. The injustice of England roused her most\r\ndistinguished sons, in her own Parliament, to call for the cessation\r\nof the war. It inspired the eloquence of Chatham to those strains of\r\nundying fame. In the Senate of the United States there is a favorite\r\nson of Massachusetts, to whom has been accorded powers unsurpassed\r\nby those of any English orator. He has now before him the cause of\r\nChatham. His country is engaged in unrighteous war. Join now in asking\r\nhim to raise his eloquent voice in behalf of justice, and of peace\r\nfounded on justice; and may the spirit of Chatham descend upon him!\r\n\r\nLet us call upon the whole country to rally in this cause. And may\r\na voice go forth from Faneuil Hall to-night, awakening fresh echoes\r\nthroughout the valleys of New England,--swelling as it proceeds, and\r\ngathering new reverberations in its ample volume,--traversing the whole\r\nland, and still receiving other voices, till it reaches our rulers at\r\nWashington, and, in tones of thunder, demands the cessation of this\r\nunjust war!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes.\r\n    The punctuation and spelling are as in the original publication\r\n    with the exception of the following:\r\n\r\n    line 7271 enfore is now enforce.\r\n    line 2611 Gibeon is now Gideon.\r\n\r\n    Page 242 was a numbered blank page.\r\n\r\n    The oe ligature has been expanded.",
