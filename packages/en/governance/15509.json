FIFTEEN YEARS OF PREMIERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURIER: A STUDY IN CANADIAN POLITICS\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMB TO POWER.\r\n\r\nTHE life story of Laurier by Oscar D. Skelton is the official\r\nbiography of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Official biographies of public men\r\nhave their uses; they supply material for the definitive biography\r\nwhich in the case of a great man is not likely to be written by one\r\nwho knew him in the flesh. An English public man, who was also a\r\nnovelist and poet, wrote:\r\n\r\n \"Ne'er of the living can the living judge,\r\n Too blind the affection or too fresh the grudge.\"\r\n\r\nThe limitation is equally true in the case of one like Sir Wilfrid\r\nLaurier who, though dead, will be a factor of moment in our politics\r\nfor at least another generation. Professor Skelton's book is\r\ninteresting and valuable, but not conclusive. The first volume is a\r\npolitical history of Canada from the sixties until 1896, with\r\nLaurier in the setting at first inconspicuously but growing to\r\ngreatness and leadership. For the fifteen years of premiership the\r\nbiographer is concerned lest Sir Wilfrid should not get the fullest\r\ncredit for whatever was achieved; while in dealing with the period\r\nafter 1911, constituting the anti-climax of Laurier's career, Mr.\r\nSkelton is avowedly the alert and eager partisan, bound to find his\r\nhero right and all those who disagreed with him wrong. Sir Wilfrid\r\nLaurier is described in the preface as \"the finest and simplest\r\ngentleman, the noblest and most unselfish man it has ever been my\r\ngood fortune to know;\" and the work is faithfully devoted to the\r\nelucidation of this theme. Men may fail to be heroes to their valets\r\nbut they are more successful with their biographers. The final\r\nappraisement of Sir Wilfrid, to be written perhaps fifty years hence\r\nby some tolerant and impartial historian, will probably not be an\r\necho of Prof. Skelton's judgment. It will perhaps put Sir Wilfrid\r\nhigher than Prof. Skelton does and yet not quite so high; an abler\r\nman but one not quite so preternaturally good; a man who had\r\naffinities with Macchiavelli as well as with Sir Galahad.\r\n\r\nThe Laurier of the first volume is an appealing, engaging and most\r\nattractive personality. There was about his earlier career something\r\nromantic and compelling. In almost one rush he passed from the\r\ncomparative obscurity of a new member in 1874 to the leadership of\r\nthe French Liberals  in 1877; and then he suffered a decline which\r\nseemed to mark him as one of those political shooting stars which\r\nblaze in the firmament for a season and then go black; like Felix\r\nGeoffrion who, though saluted by Laurier in 1874 as the coming\r\nleader, never made any impress upon his times. A political accident,\r\nfortunate for him, opened the gates again to a career; and he set\r\nhis foot upon a road which took him very far.\r\n\r\nThe writer made acquaintance with Laurier in the Dominion session of\r\n1884. He was then in his forty-third year; but in the judgment of\r\nmany his career was over. His interest in politics was, apparently,\r\nof the slightest. He was deskmate to Blake, who carried on a\r\ntremendous campaign that session against the government's C. P. R.\r\nproposals. Laurier's political activities consisted chiefly of being\r\nan acting secretary of sorts to the Liberal leader. He kept his\r\nreferences in order; handed him Hansards and blue-books in turn;\r\nsummoned the pages to clear away the impedimenta and to keep the\r\nglass of water replenished--little services which it was clear he\r\nwas glad to do for one who engaged his ardent affection and\r\nadmiration. There were memories in the house of Laurier's eloquence;\r\nbut memories only. During this session he was almost silent. The\r\ntall, courtly figure was a familiar sight in the chamber and in the\r\nlibrary--particularly in the library, where he could be found every\r\nday ensconced in some congenial alcove; but the golden voice was\r\nsilent. It was known that his friends were concerned about his\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nLAURIER AND THE RIEL AGITATION\r\n\r\nThe \"accident\" which restored Laurier to public life and opened up\r\nfor him an extraordinary career was the Riel rebellion of 1885. In\r\nthe session of 1885, the rebellion being then in progress, he was\r\nheard from to some purpose on the subject of the ill treatment of\r\nthe Saskatchewan half-breeds by the Dominion government. The\r\nexecution of Riel in the following November changed the whole course\r\nof Canadian politics. It pulled the foundations from under the\r\nConservative party by destroying the position of supremacy which it\r\nhad held for a generation in the most Conservative of provinces and\r\ncondemned it to a slow decline to the ruin of to-day; and it\r\nprofoundly affected the Liberal party, giving it a new orientation\r\nand producing the leader who was to make it the dominating force in\r\nCanadian politics. These things were not realized at the time, but\r\nthey are clear enough in retrospect. Party policy, party discipline,\r\nparty philosophy are all determined by the way the constituent\r\nelements of the party combine; and the shifting from the Conservative\r\nto the Liberal party of the political weight of Quebec, not as the\r\nresult of any profound change of conviction but under the influence\r\nof a powerful racial emotion, was bound to register itself in time\r\nin the party outlook and morale. The current of the older tradition\r\nran strong for some time, but within the space of about twenty years\r\nthe party was pretty thoroughly transformed. The Liberal party of\r\nto-day with its complete dependence upon the solid support it gets\r\nin Quebec is the ultimate result of the forces which came into play\r\nas the result of the hanging of Riel.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of so many years there is no need for lack of candor\r\nin discussing the events of 1885. To put it plainly Riel's fate\r\nturned almost entirely upon political considerations. Which was the\r\nless dangerous course,--to reprieve him or let him hang? The issue\r\nwas canvassed back and forth by the distracted ministry up to the\r\nday before that fixed for the execution when a decision was reached\r\nto let the law take its course. The feeling in Quebec in support of\r\nthe commutation was so intense and overwhelming that it was accepted\r\nas a matter of course that Riel would be reprieved; and the news of\r\nthe contrary decision was to them, as Professor Skelton says,\r\n\"unbelievable.\" The actual announcement of the hanging was a match\r\nto a powder magazine. That night there were mobs on the streets of\r\nMontreal and Sir John Macdonald was burned in effigy in Dominion\r\nsquare. On the following Sunday forty thousand people swarmed around\r\nthe hustings on Champ de Mars and heard the government denounced in\r\nevery conceivable term of verbal violence by speakers of every tinge\r\nof political belief. This outpouring of a common indignation with\r\nits obliteration of all the usual lines of demarcation was the\r\nresult of the \"wounding of the national self-esteem\" by the flouting\r\nof the demand for leniency, as it was put by La Minerve. Mercier put\r\nit still more strongly when he declared that \"the murder of Riel\r\nwas a declaration of war upon French Canadian influence in\r\nConfederation.\" A binding cement for this union of elements\r\nordinarily at war was sought for in the creation of the \"parti\r\nnational\" which a year later captured the provincial Conservative\r\ncitadel at Quebec and turned it over to Honore Mercier. This violent\r\nracial movement raged unchecked in the provincial arena, but in the\r\nfederal field it was held in leash by Laurier. That he saw the\r\npossibilities of the situation is not to be doubted. He took part in\r\nthe demonstration on Champ de Mars and in his speech 'made a\r\ndeclaration--\"Had I been born on the banks of the Saskatchewan I\r\nmyself would have shouldered a musket\"--which riveted nation-wide\r\nattention upon him. Laurier followed this by his impassioned apology\r\nfor the halfbreeds and their leader in the House of Commons, of\r\nwhich deliverance Thomas White, of the assailed ministry, justly\r\nsaid: \"It was the finest parliamentary speech ever pronounced in the\r\nparliament of Canada since Confederation.\" In the debate on the\r\nexecution of Riel all the orators of parliament took part. It was\r\nthe occasion for one of Blake's greatest efforts. Sir John Thompson,\r\nin his reply to Blake, revealed himself to parliament and the\r\ncountry as one worthy of crossing swords with the great Liberal\r\ntribune. But they and all the other \"big guns\" of the Commons were\r\nthrown into complete eclipse by Laurier's performance. It is easy to\r\nrecall after the lapse of thirty-six years the extraordinary\r\nimpression which that speech made upon the great audience which\r\nheard it--a crowded House of Commons and the public galleries packed\r\nto the roof.\r\n\r\nIn the early winter of 1886-7 Laurier went boldly into Ontario\r\nwhere, addressing great audiences in Toronto, London and other\r\npoints, he defended his position and preferred his indictment\r\nagainst the government. This was Laurier's first introduction to\r\nOntario, under circumstances which, while actually threatening, were\r\nin reality auspicious. It was at once an exhibition of moral and\r\nphysical courage and a manifestation of Laurier's remarkable\r\nqualities as a public speaker. Within a few months Laurier passed\r\nfrom the comparative obscurity to which he had condemned himself by\r\nhis apparent indifference to politics to a position in public life\r\nwhere he divided public attention and interest with Edward Blake and\r\nSir John Macdonald. When a few months later Blake, in a rare fit of\r\nthe sulks, retired to his tent, refusing to play any longer with\r\npeople who did not appreciate his abilities, Laurier succeeded to\r\nthe leadership--apparently upon the nomination of Blake, actually at\r\nthe imperious call of those inescapable forces and interests which\r\nmen call Destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEADERSHIP AND THE ROAD TO IT.\r\n\r\nLaurier, then in his 46th year, became leader of the Liberal party\r\nin June, 1887. It was supposedly a tentative experimental choice;\r\nbut the leadership thus begun ended only with his death in February,\r\n1919, nearly thirty-two years later. Laurier was a French Canadian\r\nof the ninth generation. His first Canadian ancestor, Augustin\r\nHebert, was one of the little band of soldier colonists who, under\r\nthe leadership of Maisonneuve founded Montreal in 1641. Hebert's\r\ngranddaughter married a soldier of the regiment Carignan-Salieres,\r\nFrancois Cotineau dit Champlaurier. The Heberts were from Normandy,\r\nCotineau from Savoy. From this merging of northern and southern\r\nFrench strains the Canadian family of Laurier resulted; this name\r\nwas first assumed by the grandson of the soldier ancestor. The\r\nrecord of the first thirty years of Wilfrid Laurier's life was\r\nindistinguishable from that of scores of other French-Canadian\r\nprofessional men. Born in the country (St. Lin, Nov. 20, 1841) of\r\nparents in moderate circumstances; educated at one of the numerous\r\nlittle country colleges; a student at law in Montreal; a young and\r\nstruggling lawyer, interested in politics and addicted upon occasion\r\nto political journalism.--French-Canadians by the hundreds have\r\ntravelled that road. A fortunate combination of circumstances took\r\nhim out of the struggle for a place at the Montreal bar and gave\r\nhim a practice in the country combined with the editorship of a\r\nLiberal weekly, a position which made him at once a figure of some\r\nlocal prominence. Laurier's personal charm and obvious capacity for\r\npolitics marked him at once for local leadership. At the age of 30\r\nhe was sent to the Quebec legislature as representative of the\r\nconstituency of Drummond and Arthabaska; and three years later he\r\nwent to Ottawa. The rapid retirement of the Rouge leaders, Dorion\r\nand Fournier to the bench and Letellier to the lieutenant-governorship\r\nof Quebec, opened the way for early promotion, and in 1877\r\nhe entered the cabinet of Alex. Mackenzie and assumed at the\r\nsame time the leadership of the French Liberals. Defeated in\r\nDrummond-Arthabaska upon seeking re-election he was taken to its\r\nheart by Quebec East and continued to represent that constituency\r\nfor an unbroken period of forty years. He went out of office with\r\nMackenzie in 1878, and thereafter his career which had begun so\r\npromisingly dwindled almost to extinction until the events already\r\nnoted called him back to the lists and opened for him the doors of\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nWhen Wilfrid Laurier went to Montreal in 1861 he began the study of\r\nlaw in the office of Rodolphe Laflamme, a leading figure in the\r\nRouge political group; and he joined L'Institut Canadien already far\r\nadvanced in the struggle with the church which was later to result\r\nin open warfare. Those two acts revealed his political affiliations\r\nand fixed the environment in which he was to move during the plastic\r\ntwenties. Ten years had passed since a group of ardent young men,\r\ninfected with the principles and enthusiasm of 1848, of which\r\nPapineau returning from exile in Paris was the apostle, had stormed\r\nthe constituencies of Lower Canada and had appeared in the\r\nparliament of Canada as a radical, free-thinking, ultra-Democratic\r\nparty, bearing proudly the badge of \"Rouge\"; and the passage of time\r\nwas beginning to temper their views with a tinge of sobriety. The\r\nchurch, however, had them all in her black books and Bishop Bourget,\r\nthat incomparable zealot and bigot, was determined to destroy them\r\npolitically and spiritually, to whip them into submission. The\r\nstruggle raged chiefly in the sixties about L'Institut Canadien,\r\nfrowned upon by the church because it had books in its library which\r\nwere banned by the Index and because it afforded a free forum for\r\ndiscussion. When Confederation cut the legislative connection\r\nbetween Upper and Lower Canada the church felt itself free to\r\nproceed to extremes in the Catholic province of Quebec and embarked\r\nupon that campaign of political proscription which ultimately\r\nreached a point where even the Rome of Pius IX. felt it necessary to\r\nintervene.\r\n\r\nIn this great battle for political and intellectual freedom the\r\nyoung Laurier played his part manfully. He boldly joined L'Institut\r\nCanadien, though it lay under the shadow of Bishop Bourget's\r\nminatory pastoral; and became an active member and officer. He was\r\none of a committee which tried unavailingly to effect an\r\nunderstanding with Bishop Bourget. When he left Montreal in 1866 he\r\nwas first vice-president of the Institute. His native caution and\r\nprudence and his natural bent towards moderation and accommodation\r\nenabled him to play a great and growing, though non-spectacular,\r\npart in the struggle against the church's pretensions. As his\r\nauthority grew in the party he discouraged the excesses in theory\r\nand speech which invited the Episcopal thunders; even in his\r\nearliest days his radicalism was of a decidedly Whiggish type and\r\nhis political color was several shades milder than the fiery red of\r\nPapineau, Dorion and Laflamme. Under his guidance the Rouge party\r\nwas to be transformed in outlook, mentality and convictions into\r\nsomething very different indeed; but this was still far in the\r\nfuture. But towards the church's pretensions to control the\r\npolitical convictions of its adherents he presented an unyielding\r\nfront. On the eve of his assumption of the leadership of the French\r\nLiberals he discussed at Quebec, June 1877, the question of the\r\npolitical relations between church and state and the rights of the\r\nindividual in one of his most notable addresses. In this he\r\nvindicated, with eloquence and courage, the right of the individual\r\nto be both Catholic and Liberal, and challenged the policy of\r\nclerical intimidation which had made the leaders of the church\r\nnothing but the tools and chore-boys of Hector Langevin, the Tory\r\nleader in the province. It may rightly be assumed that it was\r\nsomething more than a coincidence that not long after the delivery\r\nof this speech, Rome put a bit in the mouth of the champing Quebec\r\necclesiastics. This remained Laurier's most solid achievement up to\r\nthe time when he was called to the leadership of the Dominion\r\nLiberal party.\r\n\r\nDOUBTS AND HESITATIONS\r\n\r\nLaurier's accession to leadership caused doubt and heart-burnings\r\namong the leaders of Ontario Liberalism. Still under the influence\r\nof the Geo. Brown tradition of suspicion of Quebec they felt uneasy\r\nat the transfer of the sceptre to Laurier, French by inheritance,\r\nCatholic in religion, with a political experience derived from\r\ndealing with the feelings, ambitions and prejudices of a province\r\nwhich was to them an unknown world. Part of the doubt arose from\r\nmisconception of the qualities of Laurier. As a hard-bitten, time-worn\r\nparty fighter, with an experience going back to pre-confederation\r\ndays, said to the writer: \"Laurier will never make a leader; he has\r\nnot enough of the devil in him.\" This meant, in the brisk terminology\r\nof to-day, that he could not deliver the rough stuff. This doubter\r\nand his fellows had yet to learn that the flashing rapier in the\r\nhands of the swordsman makes a completer and far less messy job than\r\nthe bludgeon; and that there is in politics room for the delicate\r\nart of jiu-jitsu. Further, the Ontario mind was under the sway of\r\nthat singular misconception, so common to Britishers, that a\r\nFrenchman by temperament is gay, romantic, inconsequent, with few\r\nreserves of will and perseverance. Whereas the good French mind is\r\nabout the coolest, clearest, least emotional instrument of the kind\r\nthat there is. The courtesy, grace, charm, literary and artistic\r\nability that go with it are merely accessories; they are the\r\nfeathers on the arrow that help it in its flight from the twanging\r\nbow-cord to the bull's-eye. Laurier's mind was typically French with\r\nsomething also Italianate about it, an inheritance perhaps from the\r\nlong-dead Savoyard ancestor who brought the name to this continent.\r\nLater when Laurier had proved his quality and held firmly in his\r\nhands the reins of power, the fatuous Ontario Liberal explained him\r\nas that phenomenon, a man of pure French ancestry who was\r\nspiritually an Englishman--this conclusion being drawn from the fact\r\nthat upon occasion the names of Charles James Fox and Gladstone came\r\ntrippingly from his tongue. The new relationship between the\r\nLiberals and Laurier was entered upon with obvious hesitation on the\r\npart of many of the former and by apparent diffidence by the latter.\r\nIt may be that the conditional acceptance and the proffered\r\nresignation at call were tactical movements really intended by\r\nLaurier to buttress his position as leader, as most assuredly his\r\nfrequent suggestions of a readiness or intention to retire during\r\nthe last few years of his leadership were. But, whatever the\r\nuncertainties of the moment, they soon passed. Laurier at once\r\nshowed capacities which the Liberals had never before known in a\r\nleader. The long story of Liberal sterility and ineffectiveness from\r\nthe middle of the last century to almost its close is the story of\r\nthe political incapacity of its successive leaders, a demonstration\r\nof the unfitness of men with the emotional equipment of the\r\npamphleteer, crusader and agitator for the difficult business of\r\nparty management. The party sensed almost immediately the difference\r\nin the quality of the new leadership; and liked it. Laurier's powers\r\nof personal charm completed the \"consolidation of his position,\" and\r\nby the early nineties the Presbyterian Grits of Ontario were\r\nswearing by him. When Blake, after two or three years of nursing his\r\nwounds in retirement, began to think it was time to resume the\r\nbusiness of leading the Liberals, he found everywhere invisible\r\nbarriers blocking his return. Laurier was, he found, a different\r\nproposition from Mackenzie; and there was nothing for it but to\r\nreturn to his tent and take farewell of his constituents in that\r\ntale of lamentations, the West Durham letter. The new regime, the\r\nnew leadership, did not bring results at once. The party experienced\r\na succession of unexpected and unforeseen misfortunes that almost\r\nmade Laurier superstitious. \"Tell me,\" he wrote to his friend Henri\r\nBeaugrand, in August, 1891, \"whether there is not some fatality\r\npursuing our party.\" In the election of 1891 not even the\r\ntheatricality of Sir John Macdonald's last appeal nor the untrue\r\nclaim by the government that it was about, itself, to secure a\r\nreciprocal trade arrangement with Washington, could have robbed the\r\nLiberals of a triumph which seemed certain; it was the opportune\r\nrevelation, through the stealing of proofs from a printing office,\r\nthat Edward Farrer, one of the Globe editors, favored political\r\nunion with the United States, that gave victory into the hands of\r\nthe Conservatives. But their relatively narrow majority would not\r\nhave kept them in office a year in view of the death of Sir John A.\r\nMacdonald in June, 1891, and the stunning blows given the government\r\nby the \"scandal session\" of 1891, had it not been for two disasters\r\nwhich overtook the Liberals: The publication of Blake's letter and\r\nthe revelation of the rascalities of the Mercier regime. Perhaps of\r\nthe two blows, that delivered by Blake was the more disastrous. The\r\nletter was the message of an oracle. It required an interpretation\r\nwhich the oracle refused to supply; and in its absence the people\r\nregarded it as implying a belief by Blake that annexation was the\r\nlogical sequel to the Liberal policy of unrestricted reciprocity.\r\nThe result was seen in the by-election campaign of 1892 when the\r\nLiberals lost seat after seat in Ontario, and the government\r\nmajority mounted to figures which suggested that the party, despite\r\nthe loss of Sir John, was as strong as ever. The Tories were in the\r\nseventh heaven of delight. With the Liberals broken, humiliated and\r\ndiscouraged, and a young and vigorous pilot, in the person of Sir\r\nJohn Thompson, at the helm, they saw a long and happy voyage before\r\nthem. Never were appearances more illusory, for the cloud was\r\nalready in the sky from which were to come storm, tempest and\r\nruinous over-throw.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TACTICS OF VICTORY\r\n\r\nThe story of the Manitoba school question and the political struggle\r\nwhich centred around it, as told by Prof. Skelton, is bald and\r\ncolorless; it gives little sense of the atmosphere of one of the\r\nmost electrical periods in our history. The sequelae of the Riel\r\nagitation, with its stirring up of race feeling, included the Jesuit\r\nEstates controversy in parliament, the Equal Rights movement in\r\nOntario, the attack upon the use of the French language in the\r\nlegislature of the Northwest Territories and the establishment of a\r\nsystem of National schools in Manitoba through the repeal of the\r\nexisting school law, which had been modelled upon the Quebec law and\r\nwas intended to perpetuate the double-barrelled system in vogue in\r\nthat province. The issue created by the Manitoba legislation\r\nprojected itself at once into the federal field to the evident\r\nconsternation of the Dominion government. It parried the demand for\r\ndisallowance of the provincial statute by an engagement to defray\r\nthe cost of litigation challenging the validity of the law. When the\r\nPrivy Council, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court, found\r\nthat the law was valid because it did not prejudicially affect\r\nrights held prior to or at the time of union, the government was\r\nfaced with a demand that it intervene by virtue of the provisions in\r\nthe British North America act, which gave the Dominion parliament\r\nthe power to enact remedial educational legislation overriding\r\nprovincial enactments in certain circumstances. Again it took refuge\r\nin the courts. The Supreme Court of Canada held that under the\r\ncircumstances the power to intervene did not exist; and the\r\ngovernment breathed easier. Again the Privy Council reversed the\r\njudgment of the Supreme Court and held that because the Manitoba law\r\nprejudicially affected educational privileges enjoyed by the\r\nminority after union there was a right of intervention. The last\r\ndefence of the Dominion government against being forced to make a\r\ndecision was broken down; in the language of to-day, it was up\r\nagainst it. And the man who might have saved the party by inducing\r\nthe bishops of the Catholic church to moderate their demands was\r\ngone, for Sir John Thompson died in Windsor Castle in December,\r\n1894, one month before the Privy Council handed down its fateful\r\ndecision. Sir John was a faithful son of the church, with an immense\r\ninfluence with the clerical authorities; he was succeeded in the\r\npremiership by Sir Mackenzie Bowell, ex-grand master of the Orange\r\nOrder. The bishops moved on Ottawa and demanded action.\r\n\r\nThere ensued a duel in tactics between the two parties, intensely\r\ninteresting in character and in its results surprising, at least for\r\nsome people. The parties to the struggle which now proceeded to\r\nconvulse Canada were the government of Manitoba, the author of the\r\nlaw in question, the Roman Catholic hierarchy in their capacity of\r\nguardians and champions of the Manitoba minority, and the two\r\nDominion political parties. The bishops were in deadly earnest in\r\nattack; so was the Manitoba government in defence; but with the\r\nothers the interest was purely tactical. How best to set the sails\r\nto catch the veering winds and blustering gusts to win the race, the\r\nprize for which was the government of Canada? The Conservatives had\r\nthe right of initiative--did it give them the advantage? They\r\nthought so; and so did most of the Liberal generals who were mostly\r\nin a blue funk during the year 1895 in anticipation of the hole into\r\nwhich the government was going to place them. But there was at least\r\none Liberal tactician who knew better.\r\n\r\nThe Conservatives decided upon a line of action which seemed to them\r\nto have the maximum of advantage. They would go in for remedial\r\nlegislation. In the English provinces they would say that they did\r\nthis reluctantly as good, loyal, law-abiding citizens obeying the\r\norder of the Queen delivered through the Privy Council. From their\r\nexperiences with the electors they had good reason to believe that\r\nthis buncombe would go down. But in Quebec they would pose as the\r\ndefenders of the oppressed, loyal co-operators with the bishops in\r\nrebuking, subduing and chaining the Manitoba tyrants. Obviously they\r\nwould carry the province; if Laurier opposed their legislation they\r\nwould sweep the province and he would be left without a shred of the\r\nparticular support which was supposed to be his special contribution\r\nto a Liberal victory. The calculation looked good to the\r\nConservatives; also to most of the Liberals. As one Liberal veteran\r\nput it in 1895: \"If we vote against remedial legislation we shall be\r\nlost, hook, line and sinker.\" But there was one Liberal who thought\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis name was J. Israel Tarte. Tarte was in office an impossibility;\r\npower went to his head like strong wine and destroyed him. But he\r\nwas the man whose mind conceived, and whose will executed, the\r\nNapoleonic stroke of tactics which crumpled up the Conservative army\r\nin 1896 and put it in the hole which had been dug for the Liberals.\r\nOn the day in March, 1895, when the Dominion government issued its\r\ntruculent and imperious remedial order, Tarte said to the present\r\nwriter: \"The government is in the den of lions; if only Greenway\r\nwill now shut the door.\" At that early day he saw with a clearness\r\nof vision that was never afterwards clouded, the tactics that meant\r\nvictory: \"Make the party policy suit the campaign in the other\r\nprovinces; leave Quebec to Laurier and me.\" He foresaw that the\r\nissue in Quebec would not be made by the government nor by the\r\nbishops; it would be whether the French-Canadians, whose imagination\r\nand affections had already been captured by Laurier, would or would\r\nnot vote to put their great man in the chair of the prime minister\r\nof Canada. All through the winter and spring of 1895 Tarte was\r\nsinking test wells in Quebec public opinion with one uniform result.\r\nThe issue was Laurier. So the policy was formulated of marking time\r\nuntil the government was irretrievably committed to remedial\r\nlegislation; then the Liberals as a solid body were to throw\r\nthemselves against it. So Laurier and the Liberal party retired\r\nwithin the lines of Torres Vedras and bided their time.\r\n\r\nBut Tarte had no end of trouble in keeping the party to the path\r\nmarked out. The fainthearts of the other provinces could not keep\r\nfrom their minds the haunting fear that the road they were marching\r\nalong led to a morass. They wanted a go-as-you please policy by\r\nwhich each section of the party could make its own appeal to local\r\nfeeling. Laurier was never more indecisive than in the war councils\r\nin which these questions of party policy were fought over. And with\r\ngood reason. His sympathy and his judgment were with Tarte but he\r\nfeared to declare himself too pronouncedly. The foundation stone of\r\nTarte's policy was a belief in the overwhelming potency of Laurier's\r\nname in Quebec; Laurier was naturally somewhat reluctant to put his\r\nown stock so high. He had not yet come to believe implicitly in his\r\nstar. Within forty-eight hours of the time when Laurier made his\r\nspeech moving the six months' hoist to the Remedial bill, a group of\r\nLiberal sub-chiefs from the English provinces made a resolute\r\nattempt to vary the policy determined upon. Their bright idea was\r\nthat Clarke Wallace, the seceding cabinet minister and Orange\r\nleader, should move the six months' hoist; this would enable the\r\nLiberals to divide, some voting for it and some against it. But the\r\nbold idea won. With Laurier's speech of March 3, 1896, the death-blow\r\nwas given to the Conservative administration and the door to\r\noffice and power opened to the Liberals.\r\n\r\nThe campaign absolutely vindicated the tactical foresight of Tarte.\r\nA good deal might be said about that campaign if space were\r\navailable. But one or two features of it may be noted. In the\r\nEnglish provinces great play was made with Father Lacombe's minatory\r\nletter to Laurier, sent while the issue was trembling in the balance\r\nin parliament: \"If the government . . is beaten . . I inform you\r\nwith regret that the episcopacy, like one man, united with the\r\nclergy, will rise to support those who may have fallen in defending\r\nus.\" In his Reminiscences, Sir John Willison speculates as to how\r\nthis letter, so detrimental to the government in Ontario, got itself\r\npublished. Professor Skelton says boldly that it was \"made public\r\nthrough ecclesiastical channels.\" It would be interesting to know\r\nhis authority for this statement. The writer of this article says it\r\nwas published as the result of a calculated indiscretion by the\r\nLiberal board of strategy. As it was through his agency that\r\npublication of the letter was sought and secured, it will be agreed\r\nthat he speaks with knowledge. It does not, of course, follow that\r\nLaurier was a party to its publication.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1896 was on both sides lively, violent and\r\nunscrupulous. The Conservatives had two sets of arguments; and so\r\nhad the Liberals. Those of us who watched the campaign in Quebec at\r\nclose range know that not much was said there by the Liberals about\r\nthe high crime of coercing a province. Instead, stress was laid upon\r\nthe futility and inadequacy of the proposed remedial legislation;\r\nupon the high probability that more could be got for the minority by\r\nnegotiation; upon the suggestion that, negotiation failing, remedial\r\nlegislation that would really accomplish something could still be\r\ninvoked. This argument, plus the magic of Laurier's personality and\r\nTarte's organizing genius, did the business. Futile the sniping of\r\nthe curés; vain the broadsides of the bishops; empty the thunders of\r\nthe church! Quebec went to the polls and voted for Laurier.\r\nElsewhere the government just about held its own despite the burden\r\nof its remedial policy; but it was buried under the Quebec\r\navalanche. The Liberals took office sustained by the 33 majority\r\nfrom the province which had once been the citadel of political\r\nConservatism.\r\n\r\n \"Now is the winter of our discontent\r\n Made glorious summer by this sun of York;\r\n And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house\r\n In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\r\n Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\r\n Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;\r\n Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings;\r\n Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO. LAURIER AND EMPIRE RELATIONSHIPS\r\n\r\nWILFRID Laurier was Prime Minister of Canada from July 9, 1896, to\r\nOctober 6, 1911, fifteen years and three months, which, for the\r\nDominion, is a record. Sir John Macdonald was Premier of the\r\nDominion of Canada for over nineteen years, but this covered two\r\nterms separated by five years of Liberal rule.\r\n\r\nThe theory of government by party is that the two parties are\r\ncomplementary instruments of government; by periodic interchanges of\r\nposition they keep the administration of the country efficient and\r\nprogressive. The complete acceptance of this view would imply a\r\nreadiness upon the part of a party growing stale to facilitate the\r\nincoming of the required alternative administration, but no such\r\nphenomenon in politics has ever been observed. Parties, in reality,\r\nare organized states within the state. They have their own dynasties\r\nand hierarchies; and their reason for existence is to clothe\r\nthemselves with the powers, functions and glory of the state which\r\nthey control. Their desire is for absolute and continuing control to\r\nwhich they come to think they have a prescriptive right; and they\r\nnever leave office without a sense of outrage. There never yet was a\r\nparty ejected from office which did not feel pretty much as the\r\nStuarts did when they lost the throne of England; the incoming\r\nadministration is invariably regarded by them in the light of\r\nusurpers. This was very much the case with the Conservatives after\r\n1896; and the Liberals had the same feeling after 1911, that they\r\nhad been robbed, as they deemed, of their rightful heritage. Parties\r\nare not, as their philosophers claim, servants of the state\r\nco-operating in its service; their real desire is the mastery of the\r\nstate and the brooking of no opposition or rivalship. Nevertheless\r\nthe people by a sure instinct compel a change in administration\r\nevery now and then; but they move so slowly that a government well\r\nentrenched in office can usually outstay its welcome by one term of\r\noffice. The Laurier administration covering a full period of fifteen\r\nyears illustrates the operation of this political tendency. The\r\ngovernment came in with the good wishes of the people and for nearly\r\nten years went on from strength to strength, carrying out an\r\nextensive and well-considered domestic programme; then its strength\r\nbegan to wane and its vigor to relax. Its last few years were given\r\nup to a struggle against the inevitable fate that was visibly rising\r\nlike a tide; and the great stroke of reciprocity which was attempted\r\nin 1911 was not nearly so much a belated attempt to give effect to a\r\nparty principle as it was a desperate expedient by an ageing\r\nadministration to stave off dissolution. The Laurier government died\r\nin 1911, not so much from the assaults of its enemies as from\r\nhardening of its arteries and from old age. Its hour had struck in\r\nkeeping with the law of political change. Upon any reasonable survey\r\nof the circumstances it would be held that Laurier was fortunate\r\nbeyond most party leaders in his premiership--in its length, in the\r\nmeasure of public confidence which he held over so long a period, in\r\nthe affection which he inspired in his immediate following, and for\r\nthe opportunities it gave him for putting his policies into\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nViewed in retrospect most of the domestic occurrences of the Laurier\r\nregime lose their importance as the years recede; it will owe its\r\nplace in Canadian political history to one or two achievements of\r\nnote. Laurier's chief claim to an enduring personal fame will rest\r\nless upon his domestic performances than upon the contribution he\r\nmade towards the solution of the problem of imperial relations. The\r\nexamination of his record as a party leader in the prime minister's\r\nchair can be postponed while consideration is given to the great\r\nservices he rendered the cause of imperial and international\r\nLiberalism as Canada's spokesman in the series of imperial\r\nconferences held during his premiership.\r\n\r\nLaurier, up to the moment of his accession to the Liberal\r\nleadership, had probably given little thought to the question of\r\nCanada's relationship to the empire. Blake knew something about the\r\nintricacies of the question. His Aurora speech showed that as early\r\nas 1874 he was beginning to regard critically our status of\r\ncolonialism as something which could not last; and while he was\r\nminister of justice in the Mackenzie ministration he won two notable\r\nvictories over the centralizing tendencies of the colonial office.\r\nBut Laurier had never been brought into touch with the issue; and\r\nwhen, after assuming the Liberal leadership, he found it necessary\r\nto deal with it, he spoke what was probably the belief latent in\r\nmost of the minds of his compatriots: acceptance of colonial status\r\nwith the theoretical belief that some time, so far distant as not to\r\nbe a matter of political concern, this status would give way to one\r\nof independence. \"The day is coming,\" he said in Montreal in 1890,\r\n\"when this country will have to take its place among the nations of\r\nthe earth. ... I want my country's independence to be reached\r\nthrough the normal and regular progress of all the elements of its\r\npopulations toward the realization of a common aspiration.\" Looking\r\nforward to the issues about which it would be necessary for him to\r\nhave policies, it is not probable that he put the question of\r\nimperial relationships very high. Certainly he had no idea that it\r\nwould be in dealing with this matter that he would reveal his\r\nqualities at their highest and lay the surest foundation for his\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Laurier, as we have seen, believed the Canadian future was\r\nto be that of colonialism for an indefinite period and then\r\nindependence. In 1911, the year he left office, in a letter to a\r\nfriend he said: \"We are making for a harbor which was not the harbor\r\nI foresaw twenty-five years ago, but it is a good harbor. It will\r\nnot be the end. Exactly what the course will be I cannot tell, but I\r\nthink I know the general bearing and I am content.\" The change in\r\nview indicated by these words is thus expounded by Professor\r\nSkelton: \"The conception of Canada's status which Sir Wilfrid\r\ndeveloped in his later years of office was that of a nation within\r\nthe empire.\" But between the two quoted declarations there lay\r\ntwenty-one years of time, fifteen years of prime ministership and\r\nthe experiences derived from attendance at four imperial conferences\r\nin succession--another record set by Laurier not likely ever to be\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIALIST DRIVE\r\n\r\nLaurier's imperial policies were forged in the fire. He took to\r\nLondon upon the occasion of each conference a fairly just\r\nappreciation of what was politically achievable and what was not,\r\nand there he was put to the test of refusing to be stampeded into\r\npracticable courses. Professor Skelton records two enlightening\r\nconversations with Laurier dealing with the difficulties in which\r\nthe colonial representatives in attendance at these gatherings found\r\nthemselves. Said Sir Wilfrid:\r\n\r\n\"One felt the incessant and unrelenting organization of an\r\nimperialist campaign. We were looked upon, not so much as individual\r\nmen, but abstractly as colonial statesmen, to be impressed and\r\nhobbled. The Englishman is as businesslike in his politics,\r\nparticularly his external politics, as in business, even if he\r\ncovers his purposefulness with an air of polite indifference. Once\r\nconvinced that the colonies were worth keeping, he bent to the work\r\nof drawing them closer within the orbit of London with marvelous\r\nskill and persistence. In this campaign, which no one could\r\nappreciate until he had been in the thick of it, social pressure is\r\nthe subtlest and most effective force. In 1897 and 1902 it was Mr.\r\nChamberlain's personal insistence that was strongest, but in 1907\r\nand after, society pressure was the chief force. It is hard to stand\r\nup against the flattery of a gracious duchess. Weak men's heads are\r\nturned in an evening, and there are few who can resist long. We were\r\ndined and wined by royalty and aristocracy and plutocracy and always\r\nthe talk was of empire, empire, empire. I said to Deakin in 1907\r\nthat this was one reason why we could not have a parliament or\r\ncouncil in London; we can talk cabinet to cabinet, but cannot send\r\nCanadians or Australians as permanent residents to London, to debate\r\nand act on their own discretion.\"\r\n\r\nStill more enlightening is this observation:\r\n\r\n\"Sir Joseph Ward was given prominence in 1911 through the exigencies\r\nof imperialist politics. At each imperial conference some colonial\r\nleader was put forward by the imperialists to champion their cause.\r\nIn 1897 it was obvious that they looked to me to act the bell-wether,\r\nbut I fear they were disappointed. In 1902 it was Seddon; in 1907,\r\nDeakin; in 1911, Ward. He had not Deakin's ability or Seddon's\r\nforce. His London friends stuffed him for his conference speeches;\r\nhe came each day with a carefully typewritten speech, but when once\r\noff that, he was at sea.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was the intention of this \"unrelenting imperialist campaign\"?\r\nIt took many forms, wore many disguises, but in its secret purposes\r\nit was unchangeable and unwearying. It was a conscious, determined\r\nattempt to recover what Disraeli lamented that Great Britain had\r\nthrown away. Twenty years after Disraeli had referred to the\r\ncolonies as \"wretched millstones hung about our neck,\" he changed\r\nhis mind and in 1872 he made an address as to the proper relations\r\nbetween the Mother Land and the colonies which is the very\r\ncorner-stone of imperialistic doctrine. His declaration was in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Self-government, in my opinion, when it was conceded, ought to have\r\nbeen conceded as part of a great policy of imperial consolidation.\r\nIt ought to have been accompanied by an imperial tariff; by\r\nsecurities for the people of England for the enjoyment of the\r\nunappropriated lands which belonged to the sovereign as their\r\ntrustee; and by a military code which should have precisely defined\r\nthe means, and the responsibilities, by which the colonies should be\r\ndefended, and by which, if necessary, this country should call for\r\naid from the colonies themselves. It ought, further, to have been\r\naccompanied by the institution of some representative council in the\r\nmetropolis, which would have brought the colonies into constant and\r\ncontinuous relations with the home government.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the day Disraeli uttered these words down to this present time\r\nthere has been a persistent, continuous, well-financed and\r\nresourceful movement looking towards the establishment in London of\r\nsome kind of a central governing body--parliament, council, cabinet,\r\ncall it what you will--which will determine the foreign policies of\r\nthe British Empire and command in their support the military and\r\nnaval potentialities of all the dominions and dependencies. It fell\r\nto Laurier to hold the pass against this movement; and this he did\r\nfor fifteen years with patience, sagacity and imperturbable firmness\r\nagainst the enraged and embattled imperialists, both of England and\r\nCanada. Laurier, in the comment quoted above, said that in 1897 the\r\nimperialists had looked to him to act as the bell-wether. They had\r\ngood reason to be hopeful about his usefulness to them. The imperial\r\npreference just enacted by the Canadian parliament had been hailed\r\nboth in Canada and Great Britain as a great concession to\r\nimperialistic sentiment, whereas it was in reality an exceedingly\r\nastute stroke of domestic politics by which the government lowered\r\nthe tariff and at the same time spiked the guns of the high\r\nprotectionists. In 1897, when Laurier first went to England, the\r\nimperial movement was at its crescent, synchronous with the great\r\nwelling up of sentiment and reverence called forth by the Diamond\r\nJubilee of Queen Victoria. Strachey has a penetrating word about the\r\nstrength which Queen Victoria's \"final years of apotheosis\" brought\r\nto the imperialistic movement:\r\n\r\n\"The imperialist temper of the nation invested her office with a new\r\nsignificance exactly harmonizing with her own inmost proclivities.\r\nThe English policy was in the main a common-sense structure; but\r\nthere was always a corner in it where common-sense could not enter.\r\n. . . Naturally it was in the crown that the mysticism of the\r\nEnglish polity was concentrated--the crown with its venerable\r\nantiquity, its sacred associations, its imposing spectacular array.\r\nBut, for nearly two centuries, common-sense had been predominant in\r\nthe great building and the little, unexplored, inexplicable corner\r\nhad attracted small attention. Then with the rise of imperialism\r\nthere was a change. For imperialism is a faith as well as a\r\nbusiness; as it grew the mysticism in English public life grew with\r\nit and simultaneously a new importance began to attach to the crown.\r\nThe need for a symbol--a symbol of England's might, of England's\r\nworth, of England's extraordinary mystical destiny--became felt more\r\nurgently than before. The crown was the symbol and the crown rested\r\nupon the head of Victoria.\"\r\n\r\nTo be translated from the humdrum life of Ottawa to a foremost place\r\nin the vast pageantry of the Diamond Jubilee, there to be showered\r\nwith a wealth of tactful and complimentary personal attentions was\r\nrather too much for Laurier. The oratorical possibilities of the\r\noccasion took him into camp; and in a succession of speeches he gave\r\nit as his view that the most entrancing future for Canada was one in\r\nwhich she should be represented in the imperial parliament sitting\r\nin Westminster. \"It would be,\" he told the National Liberal club,\r\n\"the proudest moment of my life if I could see a Canadian of French\r\ndescent affirming the principles of freedom in the parliament of\r\nGreat Britain.\" This, of course, was nothing but the abandonment of\r\nthe orator to the rhetorical possibilities of the situation. Under\r\nthe impulse of these emotions he fell an easy victim to the\r\nconspiracy of Lord Aberdeen and Lord Strathcona (of which he later\r\nmade complaint) by which the \"democrat to the hilt\" (as Laurier had\r\nproclaimed himself but a short time earlier when he had been given\r\nprematurely the knightly title at a public function) was transmuted\r\ninto Sir Wilfrid Laurier. It was, therefore, not without apparent\r\nreason that the imperialists thought that they had captured for\r\ntheir own this new romantic and appealing figure from the premier\r\nBritish dominion. But when the imperial conference met, Mr.\r\nChamberlain, as colonial secretary, encountered not the orator\r\nintent on captivating his audience, but the cool, cautious statesman\r\nthinking of the folks at home. When the proposition for the\r\nestablishment of an imperial council was made by Mr. Chamberlain it\r\nwas deftly shelved by a declaration which stated that in the view of\r\nthe colonial prime ministers \"the present political relations are\r\ngenerally satisfactory under existing conditions.\" The wording is\r\nsuggestive of Laurier, though it is not known that he drafted the\r\nstatement. The skilful suspension of the issue without meeting it\r\nwas certainly the tactics with which he met and blocked, in\r\nsucceeding conferences, all attempts by the imperialists to give\r\npractical effect to their doctrine.\r\n\r\nFIFTEEN YEARS OF SAYING \"NO\"\r\n\r\nThe role which Laurier had to play in the successive conferences was\r\nnot one agreeable to his temperament. It gave no opening for his\r\ntalent. It supplied no opportunities for the making of the kind of\r\nspeeches at which he was a master. It kept him from the centre of\r\nthe stage, a position which Sir Wilfrid Laurier had no objection to\r\noccupying. It obliged him to courses which, in the setting in which\r\nhe found himself, must at times have seemed ungracious, and this\r\nmust have been a trial to a nature so courtly and considerate. To\r\nthe successive proposals that came before the conference, togged out\r\nin all the gorgeous garb of Imperialism, he was unable to offer\r\nconstructive alternatives; for his political sense warned him that\r\nit was twenty years too soon to suggest propositions embodying his\r\nconception of the true relations of the British nations to one\r\nanother. There was nothing to do but to block all suggestions of\r\norganic change designed to strengthen the centralizing of power and\r\nto await the development of a national spirit in Canada to the point\r\nwhere it would afford backing for a movement in the opposite\r\ndirection. So Laurier had to look pleasant and keep on saying no. To\r\nMr. Chamberlain's proposal in 1897 \"to create a great council of the\r\nEmpire,\" No. To the proposal made at the same time for a Canadian\r\nmoney contribution to the navy, No. To these propositions and others\r\nof like tenor urged in 1902 by Mr. Chamberlain with all his\r\npersuasive masterfulness, No. No naval subsidy because it \"would\r\nentail an important departure from the principle of Colonial\r\nself-government.\" No special military force in the Dominion\r\navailable for service overseas because it \"derogated from the powers\r\nof self-government.\" To the Pollock-Lyttleton suggestion of a\r\nCouncil of advice or a permanent \"secretariat\" for an \"Imperial\r\nCouncil,\" No, because it \"might eventually come to be regarded as an\r\nencroachment upon the full measure of autonomous, legislative and\r\nadministrative power now enjoyed by all the self-governing powers.\"\r\n\r\nSir Wilfrid's policy was not, however, wholly negative, for he was\r\nmainly responsible for the formal change in 1907 in the character of\r\nthe periodical conferences. The earlier conferences were between the\r\nsecretary of state and representatives of \"the self-governing\r\ncolonies.\" They were colonial conferences in fact and in name--a\r\nfact egregiously pictured to the eye in the famous photograph of the\r\nconference of 1897, revealing Mr. Chamberlain complacently seated,\r\nwith 15 colonial representatives grouped about him in standing\r\npostures. In 1907 the conference became one between governments\r\nunder the formal title of imperial conference, with the prime\r\nminister the official chairman, as primus inter pares. It was the\r\nfirst exemplification of the new theory of equality.\r\n\r\nThe change of government in Great Britain in 1905 must have brought\r\nto Sir Wilfrid a profound sense of relief; it was no longer\r\nnecessary to rest upon his armor night and day. Not that the\r\nImperialist drive ceased but it no longer found its starting point\r\nand rallying place in the Colonial office. The centralists operated\r\nfrom without, looking about for someone to put forward their ideas,\r\nas in 1911 when they took possession of Sir Joseph Ward, New\r\nZealand's vain and ambitious Prime Minister, and induced him to\r\nintroduce their half-baked schemes into the Conference. He and they\r\nwere suppressed by universal consent, Sir Wilfrid simply lending a\r\nhand. Sir Wilfrid's refusal at this conference to join Australia and\r\nother Dominions in a demand that they be consulted by the British\r\ngovernment in matters of foreign policy seemed to many out of\r\nharmony with the Imperial policies which he had been pursuing. Mr.\r\nAsquith at this conference declared that Great Britain could not\r\nshare foreign policy with the Dominions; and Sir Wilfrid declared\r\nthat Canada did not want to share this responsibility with the\r\nBritish government. Seemingly Sir Wilfrid thus accepted, despite his\r\nrepeated claim that Canada was a nation, a subordinate relation to\r\nGreat Britain in the field of foreign relations which is the real\r\ntest of nationhood. In fact, however, this was the crowning\r\nmanifestation of his wariness and far-sightedness. He realized in\r\n1911 what is only now beginning to be understood by public men who\r\nsucceeded to his high office, that a method of consultation\r\nobviously defective and carrying with it in reality no suspensory or\r\nveto power, involves by indirection the adoption of that very\r\ncentralizing system which it had been his purpose to block. If, Sir\r\nWilfrid said, Dominions gave advice they must be prepared to back it\r\nwith all their strength; yet \"we have taken the position in Canada\r\nthat we do not think we are bound to take part in every war.\" He saw\r\nin 1911 as clearly as Lloyd George did in 1921 (as witness the\r\nlatter's statement to the House of Commons in that year on the Irish\r\ntreaty) that the policy of consultation gave the Dominions a shadowy\r\nand unreal power; but imposed upon them a responsibility, serious\r\nand inescapable. He thus felt himself obliged to discourage the\r\nprocedure suggested by Premier Fisher of Australia, even though, to\r\nthe superficial observer, this involved him in the contradiction of,\r\nat the same time, exalting and depreciating the status of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURIER'S VIEW OF CANADA'S FUTURE\r\n\r\nWhat conception was there in Laurier's mind as to the right future\r\nfor Canada? He revealed it pretty clearly on several occasions;\r\nnotably in 1908 in a tercentenary address at Quebec in the presence\r\nof the present King, when he said: \"We are reaching the day when our\r\nparliament will claim co-equal rights with the British parliament\r\nand when the only ties binding us together will be a common flag and\r\na common crown.\" He was equally explicit two years later when,\r\naddressing the Ontario club in Toronto, he said: \"We are under the\r\nsuzerainty of the King of England. We are his loyal subjects. We bow\r\nthe knee to him. But the King of England has no more rights over us\r\nthan are allowed him by our own Canadian parliament. If this is not\r\na nation, what then is a nation?\" Laurier looked forward to the\r\ncomplete enfranchisement of Canada as a nation under the British\r\nCrown, with a status of complete equality with Great Britain in the\r\nBritish family. A keen-witted member of the Imperial Conference of\r\n1911, Sir John G. Findlay, Attorney-General for New Zealand, saw the\r\nreality behind the anomalous position which Sir Wilfrid held. \"I\r\nrecognized,\" he says, \"that Canadian nationalism is beginning to\r\nresent even the appearance--the constitutional forms--of a\r\nsub-ordination to the Mother country.\" \"And,\" he added, revealing\r\nthe clarity of his understanding, \"this is not a desire for\r\nseparation.\" But it was not in London that the question of Imperial\r\nrelationships presented its most thorny aspect. Laurier could\r\nmaintain there a stand-pat, blocking attitude with no more\r\ndisagreeable consequences than perhaps a little social chilliness,\r\nthe symbolical \"gracious duchess\" showing a touch of hauteur and\r\ndisappointment. It was in the reactions of the issue upon Canadian\r\npolitics that Laurier met with his real difficulties. He could not,\r\nby tactics of procrastination or evasion, keep the question out\r\nof the domestic field; the era of abject, passive and unthinking\r\ncolonialism was beginning to pass; and the spirit of nationalism was\r\nstirring the sluggish waters of Canadian politics. Sir Wilfrid had\r\nto face the issue and make the best of it. He handled the question\r\nwith consummate adroitness and judgment; but ultimately its\r\ncomplexities baffled him and the Imperialists who wanted everything\r\ndone for the Empire and the so-called \"Nationalists\" of Quebec, who\r\nwanted nothing done, joined forces against him.\r\n\r\nTHE CANADIAN IMPERIALISTS\r\n\r\nIt was the Imperialists in the old country and in Canada who gave\r\nthe issue no rest; they believed, apparently with good reason, that\r\na little urgency was all that was needed to make Canada the very\r\nforefront of the drive for the consolidation of the Empire. The\r\nEnglish-speaking Canadians were traditionally and aggressively\r\nBritish. The basic population in the English provinces was United\r\nEmpire Loyalist, which absorbed and colored all later accretions\r\nfrom the Motherland--an immigration which in its earlier stages was\r\nalso largely militarist following the reduction of the army\r\nestablishment upon the conclusion of the Napoleonic wars. It was\r\ninspired with a traditional hostility to the American republic. The\r\nhereditary devotion to the British Crown, of which Victoria to the\r\npassing generations appeared to be the permanent and unchanging\r\npersonification, threw into eclipse the corresponding sentiment in\r\nEngland. English-speaking Canadians were more British than the\r\nBritish; they were more loyal than the Queen. One can get an\r\nadmirable idea of the state of Ontario feeling in the addresses at\r\nthe various U.E. L. celebrations in the year 1884; in both its\r\nresentments and its affections there was something childish and\r\nconfiding.\r\n\r\nImperialism, on its sentimental side, was a glorification of the\r\nBritish race; it was a foreshadowing of the happy time when this\r\ngoverning and triumphant people would give the world the blessing of\r\nthe pax Britannica. \"We are not yet,\" said Ruskin in his inaugural\r\naddress, \"dissolute in temper but still have the firmness to govern\r\nand the grace to obey.\" In this address he preached that if England\r\nwas not to perish, \"she must found colonies as fast and far as she\r\nis able,\" while for the residents of these colonies \"their chief\r\nvirtue is to be fidelity to their country (i.e. England) and their\r\nfirst aim is to be to advance the power of England by land and sea.\"\r\nSeely got rid of all problems of relationship and of status by\r\nexpanding England to take in all the colonies; the British Empire\r\nwas to become a single great state on the model of the United\r\nStates. \"Here, too,\" he said, \"is a great homogeneous people, one\r\nin blood, language, religion and laws, but dispersed over a\r\nboundless space.\" Such a conception was vastly agreeable to the more\r\naggressive and assertive among the English Canadians. It kindled\r\ntheir imagination; from being colonists of no account in the\r\nbackwash of the world's affairs, they became integrally a part of a\r\ngreat Imperial world-wide movement of expansion and domination; were\r\nthey not of what Chamberlain called \"that proud, persistent,\r\nself-asserting and resolute stock which is infallibly destined to be\r\nthe predominating force in the future history and civilization of\r\nthe world\"? Moreover, it gave them a sense of their special\r\nimportance here in Canada where the population was not \"homogeneous\r\nin blood, language and religion;\" it was for them, they felt, to\r\ndirect policy and to control events; to take charge and see that\r\ndevelopments were in keeping with suggestions from headquarters\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\nWhat these Canadian parties to the great Imperial drive thought of\r\nSir Wilfrid's dilatory, evasive and blocking tactics is not a matter\r\nof surmise. Upon this point they did not practise the fine art of\r\nreticence; and their angry expostulations are to be found in the\r\npages of Hansard, in the editorial pages of the Conservative press,\r\nin the political literature of the time, in heavy condemnatory\r\narticles which found publication through various mediums. Thus Sir\r\nGeorge Foster could see in Laurier's statements to the Ontario club\r\nnothing but \"foolish, even mischievous talk.\" \"If,\" he added, \"they\r\nare merely for the sake of rhetorical adornment they are but\r\nfoolish. If, however, they are studied and serious they are\r\nrevolutionary.\" And to the extent that they could they made trouble\r\nfor Sir Wilfrid, in which labor of love they were energetically\r\nassisted, upon occasion, by high officials from the other side of\r\nthe Atlantic. Laurier had five years of more or less continuous\r\nstruggle with Lord Minto, a combination of country squire and heavy\r\ndragoon, who was sent to Canada as governor-general in 1898 to\r\nforward by every means in his power the Chamberlain policies. He\r\nbusied himself at once and persistently in trying to induce the\r\nCanadian government to commit itself formally to the policy of\r\nsupplying Canadian troops for Imperial wars. In the spring of 1899\r\nhe wanted an assurance which would justify the war office in\r\n\"reckoning officially\" upon Canadian troops \"in case of war with a\r\nEuropean power;\" in July he urged an offer of troops in the event of\r\nwar in South Africa which \"would be a proof that the component parts\r\nof the Empire are prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder to support\r\nImperial interests.\" With the outbreak of the South African war,\r\nLord Minto regarded himself less as Governor-General than as\r\nImperial commissioner charged with the vague and shadowy powers\r\nwhich go with that office; and Sir Wilfrid had, in consequence, to\r\ninstruct him on more than one occasion that Canada was still a\r\nself-governing country and not a military satrapy. Professor Skelton\r\ndoes nothing more than barely allude to these troubles; the story,\r\nwhich would be most interesting and suggestive, will perhaps never\r\nbe told. But some idea of what was afoot can be drawn from the fact\r\nthat at a public gathering in Montreal in the month of November,\r\n1899, Lord Minto was advised and instructed by an active politician\r\nand leading lawyer that under his powers as the representative of\r\nImperial authority he could order the Canadian militia to South\r\nAfrica without reference to the Canadian parliament!\r\n\r\nAssociated with Lord Minto in the applying of Imperial pressure to\r\nthe Canadian government was General Hutton, commander of the\r\nCanadian forces. In those days this position was always filled by an\r\nImperial officer who was given leave of absence in order that he\r\nmight fill the position. He was thus a Canadian official, paid out\r\nof the Canadian treasury and subject to the Canadian government; but\r\nfew of the occupants of the office were capable of appreciating this\r\nfact. They regarded themselves as representatives of the war office\r\nwith large but undefined powers in the exercise of which they\r\nfrequently found themselves in conflict with the Canadian\r\ngovernment. General Hutton's interfering activities were so\r\nobjectionable that he was got rid of by a face-saving expedient; but\r\nfour years later a successor to his office, Lord Dundonald, was\r\nformally dismissed by order-in-council for his \"unpardonable\r\nindiscretion\" in publicly criticizing the acting minister of\r\nmilitia. Lord Minto, unofficially advised by military officers and\r\nopposition politicians, resisted signing the order-in-council until\r\nit was made clear to him that the alternative would be a general\r\nelection in which the issue would be his refusal. The incident was\r\nconclusive as to the necessity of having a Canadian at the head of\r\nthe Canadian forces--a change which was subsequently effected.\r\n\r\nThese controversies and conflicts of opinion became factors in\r\nCanadian politics. The Conservatives sought in the general elections\r\nof 1900 to make an issue out of the government's hesitation in\r\ntaking part in the South African war in advance of the meeting of\r\nparliament; this, plus injudicious and provocative speeches by the\r\nincalculable Mr. Tarte and the general indictment of Laurier as\r\nlukewarm towards the cause of a \"united Empire\" weakened the\r\nLiberals in Ontario; but this loss was easily off-set by gains\r\nelsewhere. Again in 1904 the Dundonald issue was effective only in\r\nOntario which, in keeping with what appears to be an instinctive\r\npolitical process, was beginning to consolidate itself as a\r\nmake-weight against the overwhelming predominance of Liberalism in\r\nQuebec. In the 1908 elections the Imperial question was almost\r\nquiescent in the English provinces; but it was beginning to emerge\r\nin a different guise and with aspects distinctly threatening to\r\nLaurier in his own province.\r\n\r\n\"COLONIALISM INGRAINED AND IMMITIGABLE\"\r\n\r\nLaurier in resisting the Chamberlain push knew that even English-Canada,\r\nlong somnolent under a colonial regime, was not in the mood\r\nto accept the radical innovations that were being planned in\r\nWhitehall; and he knew, still better, that his own people would be\r\nagainst the programme to a man. The colonialism of the French-Canadians\r\nwas immitigable and ingrained. They had secured from the\r\nBritish parliament in 1774 special immunities and privileges as the\r\nresult of Sir Guy Carleton's hallucination that given these the\r\nFrench-Canadian habitant would assist the British authorities in\r\nchastising the rebellious American colonists into submission. These\r\nprivileges, continued and embodied in the act of confederation, were\r\nenjoyed by the French-Canadians--as they believed--by virtue of\r\nImperial guarantees; they held that they were safe in their\r\nenjoyment only While there was in the last analysis British control\r\nover Canada and while the final judgment on Canadian laws was passed\r\nby British courts. But their colonialism, unlike that of the\r\nEnglish-Canadians, was of a quality that could never be transmuted into\r\nImperialism. The racial mysticism of that movement repelled them;\r\nand still more they were deterred by the cost and dangers of\r\nImperialistic adventure. It was for England, in return for their\r\nwhole-hearted acceptance of colonial subordination, to protect them\r\ninternally against any courses by the English-Canadians which they\r\nmight choose to regard as an infringement of their privileged\r\nposition and externally against all danger of invasion or conquest.\r\n\r\nIf Sir Wilfrid had been called upon to choose only between these two\r\ncamps he could perhaps have made a choice which would not have been\r\nultimately a political liability. But the situation was not so\r\nsimple. There was a third factor which, alike by inclination and\r\npolitical necessity, Sir Wilfrid had to take into account. This was\r\nCanadian nationalism, in contrast with the racial nationalism of\r\nwhich Mr. Bourassa was the apostle. The backing upon which Sir\r\nWilfrid relied at first to resist the military and naval policies of\r\nthe Imperialists was the timidity and reluctances of colonialism;\r\nbut he knew that this was at best a temporary expedient. To urgings\r\nthat Canada should assist in the upkeep of the Imperial navy by\r\nmoney contributions and should also maintain special militia forces\r\navailable for service in Imperial wars overseas, Sir Wilfrid felt\r\nthat some more plausible reply than a brusque refusal was necessary;\r\nand he met them with the contention that Canada must create military\r\nand naval forces for her own defence which would be available for\r\nthe wars of the Empire at the discretion of the Canadian parliament.\r\nThese views put forward almost tentatively in 1902 ultimately bore\r\nfruit in definite policies of national defence. Thus the answer to\r\ndemand for naval contribution, to which policy all the other\r\nDominions had subscribed, was to declare that Canada should have her\r\nown navy; and this took form, after numerous skirmishes with\r\nadmiralty opinion, which was scandalized at the suggestion, in the\r\nNaval Service Bill of 1910.\r\n\r\nThis course, which was thus urged upon Sir Wilfrid by events, earned\r\nhim the displeasure of both the Imperialists and the Little\r\nCanadians. To the former Laurier's policy seemed little short of\r\ntreasonable, particularly his insistence that while Canada was at\r\nwar when England was at war the extent, if any, of Canada's\r\nparticipation in such war must be determined solely by the Canadian\r\nparliament. His own countrymen on the other hand viewed with\r\ndisquietude these first halting steps along the road of national\r\npreparedness; might it not lead by easy gradations to that \"vortex\r\nof militarism\" against which Sir Wilfrid had voiced an eloquent\r\nwarning? Where there is opinion capable of being exploited against a\r\ngovernment the exploiter soon appears. In Quebec, Monk,\r\nConservative, and the Nationalist, Bourassa, who entering Parliament\r\nas a follower of Laurier had developed a strong antipathy to him,\r\nwere indefatigable in alarming the habitant by interpreting to him\r\nthe secret purposes of the naval service bill. It was nothing, they\r\nclaimed, but an Imperialistic device by which the Canadian youth\r\nwould be dragged from his peaceful fireside to become cannon fodder\r\nin the Empire's wars. Meanwhile in the English provinces, the\r\ngovernment's policy was fiercely attacked as inadequate and verging\r\nupon disloyalty by the Imperialists. The Conservative opposition,\r\nafter one virtuous interlude in 1909 when they showed a fleeting\r\ndesire to take a non-political and national view of this matter of\r\ndefence, could not resist the temptation to profit by the campaign\r\nagainst the government's policy; and they joined shrilly in the\r\nderisive cry of \"tin pot navy.\" These onslaughts from opposite camps\r\nwere a factor in the elections of 1911; especially in Quebec where\r\ntwenty-seven constituencies (against eleven in 1908) elected\r\nopponents of Laurier.\r\n\r\nPOLICIES THAT ENDURE\r\n\r\nSir Wilfrid fell; but his Imperial policies lived. During the\r\ncampaign the old country Imperialists had been very busy from\r\nRudyard Kipling down--or up--in lending aid to the forces fighting\r\nthe Liberal government; and its defeat was the occasion for much\r\nrejoicing among them. Mr. A. Bonar Law, M. P., doubtless voiced\r\ntheir views when he predicted under the incoming regime, \"a real\r\nadvance towards the organic union of the Empire.\" All these hopes,\r\nlike many which preceded them, were short-lived; for Sir Robert\r\nBorden, once he got his bearings, took over the Laurier policies and\r\nwidened them. In that significant fact the clue to these policies is\r\nfound. They were not personal to Laurier, owing their coolness\r\ntowards perfervid Chamberlainism to his lack of English blood as his\r\ncritics held; they were in fact national policies dictated by the\r\nnecessities of the times. To the casual student of the development\r\nof Imperial relations for the decade following 1896, it might seem\r\nthat the Liberal conception of an Empire evolving steadily into a\r\nleague of free nations was only saved from destruction by the\r\nfortunate circumstance that Sir Wilfrid Laurier was during those\r\nyears the representative of Canada at successive Imperial\r\nconferences; but this would be, perhaps, to put his services too\r\nhigh. Canada's public men have never failed her in the critical\r\ntimes in her history when attempts were made through ignorance or\r\ndesign to turn her aside from the high road to national sovereignty;\r\nas witness Gait in 1859, Blake in his long duel with Lord Carnarvon,\r\nSir John A. Macdonald in 1885, when he resisted the premature demand\r\nfor a Canadian contingent for service in the Soudan, Tupper in the\r\nearly nineties when his vigorous resistance to the proposal that\r\nCanada should pay tribute for protection had something to do with\r\nthe demise of the Imperial Federation League. Any man fit to be\r\npremier of Canada would have taken pretty much the position that Sir\r\nWilfrid did. This does not in the least detract from the credit due\r\nLaurier. The task was his and he discharged it with tact, ability,\r\npatience and courage. For his services in holding their future open\r\nfor them every British Dominion owes the memory of Laurier a statue\r\nin its parliament square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE. FIFTEEN YEARS OF PREMIERSHIP\r\n\r\nThere have been prime ministers of Canada casually thrown up by the\r\ntide of events and as casually re-engulfed; but Wilfrid Laurier was\r\nnot one of them. There may have been something accidental in his\r\nrise to leadership, but his capture of the premiership was a solid\r\npolitical achievement. The victory of June 23, 1896, crowned with\r\ntriumph the daring strategy of the campaign. But popular opinion\r\nregarded the victory as a gift of the gods. The wheel of fortune\r\nspinning from the hands of fate had thrown into the high office of\r\nthe premiership one about whose qualifications there was doubt even\r\nin the secret minds of many of his supporters. He was a man of\r\ncharming manners and of gracious personality. His carriage on the\r\nplatform and the grace and finish of his speaking had fascinated the\r\npublic imagination. But what likelihood was there that these\r\nqualities would enable him to deal adequately with the harsh\r\nrealities, the stubborn problems which he must face as premier? Most\r\nunlikely, it was generally agreed. The Conservatives, though\r\nprofoundly chagrined at the trick fate had played upon them, looked\r\nforward with pleasurable expectation to the revenge that would be\r\ntheirs when Laurier, political dilettante and amateur, took up the\r\nburden that had been too great for their own Ulysses. They foresaw a\r\nLaurier regime which for futility and brevity would take its place\r\nin history with the ill-starred prime ministership of Mackenzie. The\r\naverage Liberal felt that the government, which would get its\r\ndriving force and executive power from someone else--identity not\r\nyet revealed--would have in Laurier a most attractive and genial\r\nfigurehead. These illusions long persisted, though there was little\r\nexcuse for them on election night and still less a month later when\r\nthe Laurier cabinet was in being.\r\n\r\nTo be a Rouge and to be in Montreal during the three weeks following\r\nthe glorious 23rd of June was the height of felicity. After nearly\r\n50 years of proscription and impotence in their own province, they\r\nwere triumphant and dominant. Moreover, since they had supplied the\r\nmajority which made possible the taking of office by the Liberals,\r\nthey would be triumphant and dominant as well in the Dominion field.\r\nAmong the election occurrences which they regarded as specially\r\nprovidential was the defeat of Tarte in Beauharnois. If he had been\r\nelected it might have been necessary for Laurier to do something for\r\nhim, but now that he had fallen upon the glacis of the impregnable\r\nfortress he had elected to assail, who were they to repine over the\r\ndoings of fate? \"The Moor has done his work; the Moor can go!\"\r\nMoreover, had he not been for long an inveterate Bleu? Had he not\r\nactually been the organizer of Bleu victory when Laurier experienced\r\nhis memorable defeat in Drummond-Arthabaska in 1877? His defeat made\r\nit possible to have a simon-pure Rouge contingent from Quebec.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus indulging in roseate day-dreams the actual\r\nbusiness of cabinetmaking was going forward, with Tarte at Laurier's\r\nright hand as chief adviser from Quebec. The writer has a very clear\r\nrecollection of a long conversation which he had at that time with\r\nTarte. Much of it was given up to picturesque and forthright\r\ndenunciation by Tarte of the means by which he had been defeated in\r\nBeauharnois. The mill-owners at Valleyfield, he said, had lined up\r\ntheir operatives and had given them the option of voting for\r\nBergeron or getting out. The worth to a country of an industrial\r\nsystem which makes political serfs of its workmen was vigorously\r\nchallenged in language which had little resemblance to the harangues\r\nwhich led to Tarte's undoing six years later. From this he went on\r\nto speak of Laurier's qualities and the amazing ignorance of them\r\nshown even by his intimates of his own race. There had been much\r\nspeculation in Montreal as to who should be the new high\r\ncommissioner for Canada in London. Sir Donald A. Smith, who had been\r\nappointed in the last weeks of Conservative rule, would be, it was\r\nassumed, dismissed. Tarte scouted the idea that Smith would be\r\ndisturbed. Laurier was not that kind of a man. He would not dismiss\r\nSmith; he would make friends with him. Sir Donald was a man of\r\naffairs, and so was Laurier; they would co-operate with one another.\r\n\"These people do not understand Laurier; he has a governing mind; he\r\nwants to do things; he has plans; he will walk the great way of life\r\nwith anyone of good intention who will join him.\" With much more to\r\nthe same effect. To Tarte, who was his intimate, Laurier at this\r\nmoment did not appear as one overcome with his destiny and drifting\r\nwith the tide, but as the resolute captain of the ship, who knew\r\nwhere he wanted to go, had a fairly clear idea as to how to get\r\nthere, and also knew whom he wanted with him on the voyage. Later on\r\nTarte forgot about this.\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThere was verification of Tarte's estimate in the job of cabinet-making\r\nturned out by Laurier in July. In building the government the\r\nlines of least resistance were not followed. A dozen men who deemed\r\nthemselves sure of cabinet rank found themselves overlooked; five of\r\nfifteen portfolios went to men imported from provincial arenas\r\nwithout Dominion parliamentary experience. Laurier knew the kind of\r\ngovernment he wanted and he provided himself with such a government\r\nby the direct method of getting the colleagues he desired wherever\r\nhe could find them. No doubt he found plenty of employment for his\r\nsunny ways in placating his disappointed colleagues. In time there\r\nwere consolation prizes for all, for this one a judgeship, for that\r\none a lieutenant-governorship, for the next a life seat in the\r\nsenate; the phalanx of fighting second-raters who had done valuable\r\nwork in opposition, reinforcing and buttressing the work of the\r\nfront benches disappeared gradually from parliament. And with those\r\nhe chose he too had his way, as witness the side-tracking of Sir\r\nRichard Cartwright to the dignified but at the time relatively\r\nunimportant department of trade and commerce. Between Sir Richard\r\nand the Canadian manufacturers there was a blood feud. It was not\r\nSir Wilfrid's intention to make the feud his own or even to agree to\r\nit being carried on by Sir Richard. He took for minister of finance,\r\nW. S. Fielding, who justified his choice by successfully steering\r\nthe budget bark between Scylla and Charybdis for fourteen years in\r\nsuccession before the whirlpool finally sucked him down. Where\r\nLaurier went outside his following for colleagues he had equally\r\ndefinite ends to serve.\r\n\r\nThe care with which Laurier chose his colleagues, and his\r\nindifference to personal appeal, should have been proof sufficient\r\nto the public that he was a prime minister who looked forward and\r\nplanned for the future. And the plan? Why to stay in power for the\r\nlongest possible period of time. It is as natural for a government\r\nto want to stay in power as it is for a man to want to live; nor is\r\nthere in this anything discreditable. A prime minister is sure that\r\nhe desires to retain power in order that he may serve the country as\r\nno rival could conceivably serve it; and even if the desire fades\r\nand is replaced by a lively appreciation of the personal\r\nsatisfactions which can be served by the office, no real prime\r\nminister notices the transformation. The ego and the country soon\r\nbecome interblended in his mind. A prime minister under the party\r\nsystem as we have had it in Canada is of necessity an egotist and\r\nautocrat. If he comes to office without these characteristics his\r\nenvironment equips him with them as surely as a diet of royal jelly\r\ntransforms a worker into a queen bee.\r\n\r\nLaurier saw that an efficient government, harmonious in its policies\r\nand ably led, would afford a contrast to the preceding\r\nadministration that must forcibly impress the Canadian people. He,\r\ntherefore created a government of all the talents. Anxious for\r\ndiscreet handling of the difficult fiscal problem he turned to Nova\r\nScotia for W. S. Fielding. Foreseeing the possibility of grave\r\nconstitutional problems arising he put the portfolio of justice into\r\nthe hands of the wisest and most venerable of Liberals, Sir Oliver\r\nMowat. Recognizing that a backward and stagnant west meant failure\r\nfor his administration he placed the department of interior, which\r\nhad become a veritable circumlocution office, under the direction of\r\nthe ablest and most aggressive of western Liberal public men,\r\nClifford Sifton. The time was to come when other values were to hold\r\nin relation to cabinet appointments; but in the beginning efficiency\r\nwas the test, at least in intention. It was thus Laurier proposed in\r\npart to build foundations under his house that it might endure. And\r\nto insure that virtue should not lack its reward he proceeded to\r\nbuttress the edifice by a second line of support.\r\n\r\nIn the general election of 1896 the Liberal strategy had been to\r\ngive the party managers in the English provinces an apparent choice\r\nof the best weapons, but with all these advantages the results\r\nshowed that they had barely held their own. The majority came from\r\nQuebec where Laurier had apparently to face the heaviest odds. The\r\nnatural inference was not lost upon Laurier. If he was to remain in\r\npower he must look to Quebec for his majority. A majority was\r\nnecessary and he must get it where it was to be had. This decision\r\nwas at first probably purely political. The consequences were not\r\nfully foreseen, that to get this support a price would have to be\r\npaid--by the Liberals of the other provinces. Still less was it\r\nforeseen that the overwhelming support of his own people would\r\nbecome not only politically essential to Laurier but a moral\r\nnecessity as well--something which in time he felt, by an imperious\r\ndemand of the spirit, that he must hold even though this allegiance\r\nbecame not a political asset but a liability. Gradually, perhaps\r\ninsensibly at first, in opposition possibly to his judgment,\r\ncertainly to his public professions oft repeated, he came to regard\r\nit as necessary to so shape party policy as always to command the\r\napproval of French-Canadian public opinion. Sir Wilfrid lived to\r\nsee, as the culmination of 20 years of this policy, the French and\r\nthe English-Canadians more sharply divided than they had been for 80\r\nyears. Such is the capacity of the human mind for self-deception\r\nthat he could see in this divergence nothing but the proof that his\r\nlife's work had been destroyed by envious and designing men.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATION STONE OF POLICY\r\n\r\nQuebec in turning Laurierite did not turn Liberal. This was the\r\nfactor hidden from the public eye that governed the future. The\r\nLaurier sweep of Quebec in 1896 was the result of a combination of\r\nthe Bleu and Rouge elements. The old dominant French-Canadian party\r\nhad been made up of Bleus and Castors--factions bitterly divided by\r\ndifferences of temperament, of outlook and belief, and still more by\r\ndesperate personal feuds between the leaders. When the coming of\r\nresponsible government broke up the solidarity of the French-Canadians\r\nthey separated into three groups, the controlling factor in each\r\ncase being religious belief. The Castors were ultra-clerical\r\nand ultramontane; the Bleus inherited the tradition of Gallicanism;\r\nthe Rouges imported and adapted the anti-clericalism of European\r\nLiberals. Various influences--the brilliance and resourcefulness of\r\nCartier's leadership and antipathy to Rouge extremism among them--kept\r\nBleu and Castor in an uneasy alliance. This alliance began to\r\ndisintegrate when Laurier rose to the command of the Liberals. There\r\nwas a steady drift from the Bleu to the Liberal camp--by this time\r\nthe old definition of \"Rouge\" was under taboo; and in 1896 the Bleus\r\nmoved over almost in a body. This was not an altogether instinctive\r\nand voluntary movement; it was suggested, inspired, successfully\r\nshepherded and safely delivered.\r\n\r\nTarte's confidence that Laurier could win Quebec was not based\r\nwholly upon faith in the power of Laurier's personal appeal. He was\r\nhimself a Bleu leader brought into accidental relations with the\r\nLiberals. His breach with the Conservatives began as one of the\r\nunending Castor-Bleu feuds. His knowledge of the McGreevy-Connolly\r\nfrauds gave him the power, as he thought, to blow the Castor chief,\r\nSir Hector Langevin--a cold, selfish, greedy, domineering, rather\r\nstupid man--into thinnest air, thus opening the road to the\r\nleadership of the French-Conservatives to his friend and leader, the\r\nbrilliant, unscrupulous and ambitious Chapleau. He over-estimated\r\nhis power. The whole strength of the government at Ottawa was at\r\nonce concentrated in keeping the lid on that smouldering cauldron of\r\nstench and rottenness, the system of practical politics of that day.\r\nThe Conservative chiefs tried to suppress Tarte and he refused to be\r\nsuppressed--there was not a drop of coward's blood in his veins.\r\nThen they set to work to destroy him. He sought a refuge and he\r\nfound it--in parliament, to which he was elected in 1891 as an\r\nIndependent as the result of an arrangement with Laurier. As he used\r\nto say, it was a case of parliament or jail for him.\r\n\r\nInevitably, in following up his charges in parliament, Tarte was\r\nthrown into more and more intimate relations with the Liberal\r\nleaders. He knew that for him there was no Conservative forgiveness;\r\nas he was wont to say: \"I have spoiled the soup for too many.\" It\r\nwas not long before Sir John Thompson could congratulate Laurier, in\r\none of the sharpest sayings parliament ever heard, upon having among\r\nhis lieutenants--\"the black Tarte and the yellow Martin.\" For ten\r\nyears he remained Laurier's chief lieutenant in Quebec, but he never\r\nin any sense of the word became a Liberal, though in 1902, just\r\nbefore he was thrown from the battlements, he busied himself in\r\nreading lifelong Liberals out of the party. Chapleau, who was\r\nTarte's confidant and ally, though he was also a member of the\r\nDominion government, became Lieutenant-governor of Quebec and\r\nretired to Spencer Wood, but not to forget politics among its\r\nshades. When the peculiar developments of the Dominion campaign of\r\n1896 made it evident that Conservative victory in Quebec under the\r\nvirtual leadership of the bishops meant the permanent domination of\r\nthe Castors, the whole Bleu influence was thrown to the Liberals.\r\n\r\nProfessor Skelton's life of Laurier does not take us much behind the\r\nscenes. It is in the main a record of political events, with\r\ncomments upon Laurier's relations to them. Laurier's letters, mostly\r\nto unnamed correspondents, are of slight interest, but to this there\r\nare a few notable exceptions. There are letters between Laurier,\r\nTarte and Chapleau of the greatest political value. They make clear\r\nto a demonstration, what shrewd political observers of that day\r\nsurmised, that there was a definite political understanding between\r\nthese three men. This explains the composition of the Quebec\r\ndelegation in the Laurier government. Apart from Laurier there was\r\nin it no representative of French Catholic Liberalism, unless the\r\npurely nominal honor of minister without portfolio given to C. A.\r\nGeoffrion is to be taken as giving this representation. C. A. did\r\nnot put the honor very high. \"I am,\" he said, \"the mat before the\r\ndoor.\" Tarte, a Quebecker and a Bleu, became Montreal's\r\nrepresentative at Ottawa. Disappointment among the Liberals led\r\nfirst to rage and then to rage plus fear as Tarte with the magic\r\nwand of the patronage and power of the public works department,\r\nbegan to make over the party organization in the province. Open\r\nrebellion under François Langelier broke out in December: \"A\r\ncoalition with Chapleau,\" Langelier informed the public, \"is under\r\nway.\" But the rebellion died away. The Laurier influence was too\r\nstrong. Langelier was quite right in his statement. The coalition\r\nmovement at that time was far advanced. The letter from Chapleau to\r\nLaurier, bearing date February 21, 1897, quoted by Professor\r\nSkelton, was that of one political intimate to another. Take this\r\nparagraph as an illustration: \"The Castors in the battle of June\r\n23rd lost their head and their tail; their teeth and claws are worn\r\ndown; even breath is failing for their cries and their movements and\r\nI hope that before the date of the Queen's jubilee we shall be able\r\nto say that this race of rodents is extinct and figures only in\r\ncatalogues of extinct species.\" The reference to the coming\r\nextinction of the Castors had relation to the then pending\r\nprovincial elections as to which he made certain references to\r\npolitical strokes which \"I am preparing.\" Associated with this\r\nLaurier-Tarte-Chapleau triumvirate was a fourth, C. A. Dansereau,\r\nnominally postmaster of Montreal, actually the most restless\r\npolitical intriguer in the province of Quebec. Dansereau had been\r\nthe brains of the old Senecal-Chapleau combination which had\r\ndominated Quebec in the eighties. Just what Laurier thought of the\r\ncompany he was now keeping was a matter of record for he had set it\r\nforth in a famous article in L'Electeur in 1882 entitled \"The Den of\r\nThieves,\" which led to L. A. Senecal, the Bleu \"boss,\" prosecuting\r\nhim for criminal libel. Laurier stood his trial in Montreal, pleaded\r\njustification, and after a hard fought battle won a virtual triumph\r\nthrough a disagreement of the jury with ten of the jurymen favorable\r\nto acquittal.\r\n\r\nLAST ROUND WITH THE BISHOPS\r\n\r\nLittle wonder that Francois Langelier, his brother Charles, and\r\nother associates of Laurier in the lean years of proscription were\r\nconsumed with indignation that Laurier should pass them by to\r\nassociate with his former enemies. They did not realize the\r\npolitical necessity that controlled Laurier's course. Laurier had\r\ngreat need to hold his new allies for his position in Quebec for the\r\nfirst year or so of office was precarious. The Manitoba school\r\nquestion had still to be settled. Laurier was political realist\r\nenough to know that he would have to take what he could get and this\r\nhe would have to dress up and present to the public as his own\r\nchild. He knew that the bishops, chagrined, humiliated, enraged by\r\ntheir election experience, were only waiting for the announcement of\r\nsettlement to open war on him. It would then depend upon whether or\r\nnot they were more successful than in June in commanding the support\r\nof their people. In Laurier's own words: \"They will not pardon us\r\nfor their check of last summer; they want revenge at all costs.\"\r\n\r\nThe real fight, it was recognized, would be in Rome. Thither there\r\nwent within two months of the Liberals taking office, two emissaries\r\nof the French Liberals, the parish priest of St. Lin, a lifelong,\r\npersonal and political friend of Laurier, and Chevalier Drolet, one\r\nof the Canadian papal Zouaves, who had rallied to the defence of the\r\nHoly City twenty-six years before. There followed swiftly two more\r\ndistinguished intermediaries, Charles Fitzpatrick, solicitor-general\r\nof Canada, and Charles Russell, of London, son of Lord Russell of\r\nKillowen. Backing them up was a petition to the pope signed by\r\nLaurier and forty-four members of parliament, protesting against the\r\npolitical actions of the Canadian episcopate. Nor did the Canadian\r\nhierarchy lack representation in Rome. While this conflict of\r\ninfluence was in progress at Rome, the terms of the Manitoba school\r\nsettlement were made public in November, 1896. The settlement\r\nembodied substantial concessions in fact, but Archbishop Langevin\r\nand his fellow clerics at once fell upon it. Langevin denounced it\r\nas a farce. To Cardinal Begin it appeared an \"indefensible\r\nabandonment of the best established, most sacred rights of the\r\nCatholic minority.\" A regime of religious proscription was\r\ninaugurated. Public men were subjected to intimidation; Liberal\r\nnewspapers were banned, among them L'Electeur, the chief organ of\r\nthe party. The bishops destroyed themselves by their violence. Rome\r\ndoes not lightly quarrel with governments and prime ministers. By\r\nMarch Mgr. Merry Del Val was in Canada as apostolic delegate; and\r\nthough care was taken to save the faces of the bishops, their\r\nconcerted assaults upon the government ceased. Laurier had never\r\nagain to face the embattled bishops, which is not the same thing as\r\nsaying that they ceased to take a hand in politics. As Professor\r\nSkelton truly remarks: \"The Archbishop of Montreal, Monseigneur Paul\r\nBruchesi, who kept in close touch with Wilfrid Laurier, soon proved\r\nthat sunny ways and personal pressure would go further than the\r\nstorms and thunderbolts of the doughty old warrior of Three Rivers.\"\r\nWith the bishops silenced, Laurier's foes in Quebec found the issue\r\nvalueless to them. Their political associates from other provinces,\r\nafter the disappointment of 1896, would not consent to a revival of\r\nthe question. One of the party leaders declared he would not touch\r\nit with a forty-foot pole. Tupper formally erased it from the party\r\ncalendar. The question remained quiescent; but Laurier always\r\nremained in fear of its re-emergence; and with cause. The\r\nresentments it left went underground and later had a revival in the\r\npassionate zeal with which the Quebec clergy embraced the faith of\r\nnationalism as preached by Bourassa. In one respect the school\r\nquestion and its settlement proved useful. It was the exhibit\r\nunfailingly displayed to prove upon needed occasions that the charge\r\nwas quite untrue that in directing party policy Laurier was unduly\r\nsensitive to Quebec sentiment. In effect it was said: \"Laurier made\r\nQuebec swallow in 1896; now it is your turn\"--a formula which\r\nfinally became tedious through repetition.\r\n\r\nSUPREME IN QUEBEC\r\n\r\nThe second issue which appeared for a moment to put Laurier's grip\r\non Quebec in peril was the South African war. Looking back\r\ntwenty-three years it is pretty clear that Laurier's position at the\r\noutbreak of the war, that the Canadian parliament should be\r\nconsulted as to the sending of a contingent, was wholly reasonable.\r\nThose were the days of heady Imperialism in the English provinces;\r\nand, vigorously stirred up by Laurier's party foes for political\r\npurposes, it struck out with a violence which threatened to bring\r\nserious political consequences in its train. Tarte was credited with\r\nhaving declared publicly in the Russell House rotunda: \"Not a man\r\nnor a cent for South Africa,\" which did not help matters. The storm\r\nwas so instant and threatening that Laurier and his colleagues bowed\r\nbefore it. By order-in-council Canada authorized the sending of a\r\ncontingent. Other contingents followed, and Canada took part in the\r\nwar on terms of limited liability which were agreeable to both the\r\nBritish and Canadian governments.\r\n\r\nThe South African war was most unpopular with the French-Canadians,\r\nbut the unpopularity did not extend to Laurier. They agreed in\r\ntheory with Bourassa but they recognized that Laurier had yielded to\r\nforce majeure. Indeed the very violence with which Laurier was\r\nassailed in Ontario strengthened his hold in Quebec. It is not easy\r\nfor a proud people to stomach insults such as, for instance, the\r\nremark in the Toronto News, that the English-Canadians would find\r\nsome way of \"emancipating themselves from the dominance of an\r\ninferior people whom peculiar circumstances had placed in authority\r\nin the Dominion.\" The election of 1900 gave Laurier fifty-eight\r\nsupporters in the province of Quebec out of a total of sixty-five\r\nseats. The Rouge-Bleu coalition had not come off officially,\r\nChapleau's death in 1898 having removed the necessity of formally\r\nrecognizing his services, but the coalition of Bleu and Rouge\r\nelements had taken place; and it held so firmly that when some of\r\nthe architects of the fusion tried later to undo their work they\r\nfound this could not be done. Dansereau was the first to go. Mr.\r\nMulock, the postmaster-general, entirely oblivious of the fact that\r\nDansereau was one of the main wheels in the Quebec machine and\r\nseeing in him only an entirely incapable postmaster, fired him in\r\n1899 with as little hesitation as a section boss would show in\r\nbouncing an incompetent navvy. Tarte and Laurier tried to patch up\r\nthe quarrel, but Dansereau preferred to return to journalism as\r\neditor of an independent journal whose traditions were Conservative.\r\nHe was to be, five years later, one of the leaders in that curious\r\nconspiracy, the MacKenzie-Mann-Berthiaume-La Presse deal--the details\r\nof which as told by Professor Skelton read like a detective yarn--which\r\nwas turned into opera bouffe by Laurier's decisive and timely\r\ninterference. In 1902, Tarte, in Laurier's absence and in the belief\r\nthat he could not resume the premiership on account of illness,\r\nattempted to seize the successorship by pre-emption, and was\r\npromptly dismissed from office by Laurier. Tarte and Dansereau tried\r\nto rally the Bleu forces against Laurier, but these were no longer\r\ndistinguishable from the Liberal hosts into which they had merged.\r\nTheir day was over and their power gone. Laurier reigned supreme.\r\n\r\nThese commitments and considerations furnished the background to the\r\ndrama of Laurier's premiership. Much that took place on the fore-stage\r\nis only intelligible by taking a long vision of the whole setting.\r\nThere was nothing of assertiveness or truculence in this\r\nsteady movement by which Liberal policy and outlook was given a new\r\norientation, Quebec replacing Ontario as the determinant. Students\r\nof politics can trace the changing influence through the fifteen\r\nyears of Liberal rule, in legislation, in appointments and in\r\nadministrative policies. One or two illustrations might be noted.\r\n\r\nA CHALLENGE AND A CHECK\r\n\r\nDuring the crisis of 1905 over the school provisions in the Autonomy\r\nbills erecting Alberta and Saskatchewan into provinces, Walter\r\nScott, M.P., in a letter quoted by Professor Skelton, refers to the\r\n\"almost unpardonable bungling\" which had brought the crisis about.\r\nBut Sir Wilfrid did not step into this difficulty by mischance. He\r\nknew precisely what he was doing though he did not foresee the\r\nconsequences of his action because with all his experience and\r\nsagacity he never could foretell how political developments would\r\nreact upon the English-Canadian mind. The educational provisions of\r\nthe autonomy bill were designed to remove the still lingering\r\nresentment of Quebec over the settlement of the Manitoba school\r\nquestion and to further this purpose Sir Wilfrid indulged in his\r\nspeech introducing these bills in that entirely gratuitous laudation\r\nof separate schools which had on Ontario and western Canadian\r\nopinion the enlivening effect of a match thrown into a powder\r\nbarrel. This incident revealed not only the tendency of Laurier's\r\npolicy but illustrated the tactics which he had developed for\r\nachieving his ends in the face of opposition within the party. Upon\r\noccasions of this kind he was addicted to confronting his associates\r\nand followers with an accomplished fact, leaving no alternative to\r\nsubmission but a palace rebellion which he felt confident no one\r\nwould attempt. By such methods he had already rounded several\r\ndangerous corners, as for instance his committing Canada to submit\r\nher case in the matter of the Alaska boundaries to a tribunal\r\nwithout an umpire--though it was the clearly understood policy of\r\nthe Canadian government and the Canadian parliament to insist upon\r\nan umpire; and he resorted again to a stroke of this character in\r\n1905. Professor Skelton's story of the crisis is the official\r\nversion, but there is another version which happens to be more\r\nauthentic.\r\n\r\nFollowing the general election of 1904, the government decided to\r\ndeal without further delay with the matter of setting up the new\r\nprovinces. It was known that there was danger of revival of the\r\nschool question, for during the election campaign a Toronto\r\nnewspaper had sought to make this an issue, contending that the\r\ndelay in giving the provinces constitutions was due to the demand of\r\nthe Roman Catholic church that they should include a provision for\r\nseparate schools. The policy agreed upon by the government was to\r\ncontinue in the provincial constitutions the precise rights enjoyed\r\nby the minority under the territorial school ordinances of 1901.\r\nThere was a vigorous controversy in parliament as to whether the\r\nautonomy bills in their original form kept faith with this\r\nunderstanding. Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Mr. Fitzpatrick, minister of\r\njustice, contended vehemently that they did. Clifford Sifton, who\r\nwas the western representative in the cabinet and the party most\r\ndirectly interested, held that they did not. Mr. Sifton was absent\r\nin the Southern States when the bill was drafted. He reached Ottawa\r\non his return the day after Sir Wilfrid had introduced the bills to\r\nparliament. He at once resigned. Fielding, who had also been absent,\r\nwas credited with sharing to a considerable extent Sifton's view\r\nthat the bill introduced did not embody the policy agreed upon. The\r\nresulting crisis put the government in jeopardy. A considerable\r\nnumber of members associated themselves with Mr. Sifton and the\r\ngovernment was advised that their support for the measure could only\r\nbe secured if clauses were substituted for the provisions in the act\r\nto which objection was taken. To make sure that there would be no\r\nmistake that the substituted provisions should merely continue the\r\nterritorial law as it stood, they insisted upon drafting the\r\nalternative clauses themselves. Sir Wilfrid, acutely conscious that\r\nthis constituted a challenge to his prestige and authority, used\r\nevery artifice and expedient at his command to induce the insurgents\r\neither to accept the original clause or alternatives drafted by Mr.\r\nFitzpatrick; for the first time the tactical suggestion that\r\nresignation would follow noncompliance was put forward. The\r\ndissentient members stood to their guns; Sir Wilfrid yielded and the\r\nmeasure thus amended commanded the vote of the entire party with one\r\nOntario dissentient.\r\n\r\nThe storm blew over but the wreckage remained. The episode did\r\nLaurier harm in the English provinces. It predisposed the public\r\nmind to suspicion and thus made possible the ne temere and Eucharist\r\ncongress agitations which were later factors in solidifying Ontario\r\nagainst him. In Quebec it gave Mr. Bourassa, whose hostility to\r\nLaurier was beginning to take an active form, an opportunity to\r\nrepresent Laurier as the betrayer of French Catholic interests and\r\nto put himself forward as their true champion. \"Our friend,\r\nBourassa,\" wrote Sir Wilfrid to a friend in April, 1905, \"has begun\r\nin Quebec a campaign that may well cause us trouble.\" From this\r\nmoment the Nationalist movement grew apace until six years later it\r\nlooked as though Bourassa was destined to displace Laurier as the\r\naccepted leader of the French Canadians. It was only the\r\ndevelopments of the war that restored Laurier to his position of\r\nunchallenged supremacy.\r\n\r\nIn Manitoba also there were evidences of Sir Wilfrid's preoccupation\r\nwith the business of never getting himself out of touch with Quebec\r\npublic opinion. For years he sought by private and semi-public\r\nnegotiations to get the Winnipeg school board to come to a modus\r\nvivendi with the church by which Catholic children would be\r\nsegregated in their own schools within the orbit of the public\r\nschool system, but failed, partly owing to the non possumus attitude\r\nof Archbishop Langevin, who was not prepared to be deprived of a\r\ngrievance which enabled him to mix in Quebec and Manitoba politics.\r\nThe Liberal policy of accepting provincial electoral lists for\r\nDominion purposes resulted in the Manitoba lists being compiled\r\nunder conditions to which the Liberals of this province strongly\r\nobjected, and they fought for years to secure a right to final\r\nrevision under Dominion auspices. Twice they pressed their case with\r\nsuch vigor that the government undertook to pass the requested\r\nlegislation but on both occasions resistance in the house by the\r\nConservatives led to the prompt withdrawal of the measure by Sir\r\nWilfrid. In both cases Manitoba Liberals knew quite well that the\r\ndifficulty was not the opposition of the Conservatives but the\r\nopposition of Laurier. They were advised that Laurier was\r\napprehensive of the effect of the proposed legislation upon public\r\nopinion in Quebec. He feared the criticism by his opponents that\r\nwhile Laurier would not interfere with Manitoba when it was a matter\r\nof the educational rights of the minority he was willing to\r\ninterfere when it was a matter of obliging his political friends.\r\nThere was something too in the charge that the delay in dealing with\r\nthe matter of the extension of the Manitoba boundaries arose from\r\nthe same feeling. To transfer the Northwest territories, where the\r\nminority had certain constitutional rights in matters of education,\r\nto Manitoba where the minority had none would be to put one more\r\nweapon into the hands of Mr. Bourassa. The extension of Manitoba's\r\nboundaries had to await a change in administration.\r\n\r\nTHE TALE OF FIFTEEN YEARS.\r\n\r\nThere is always a temptation to the biographer of a prime minister\r\nto relate his hero to the events of his period as first cause and\r\ncontrolling spirit--the god of the storm; whereas prime ministers,\r\nlike individuals, are the sports of destiny; things happen and they\r\nhave to make the best of them. The performances of the Laurier\r\ngovernment may be divided into two classes, those due to its own\r\ninitiative and those which were imposed by circumstances. The ratio\r\nbetween the two classes changed steadily as the administration grew\r\nin age. After the impetus born of the reforming zeal of opposition\r\nand the natural and creditable desire to fulfil express engagements\r\ndies away, the inclination of a government is not to invite trouble\r\nby looking around for difficult tasks to do. \"Those who govern,\r\nhaving much business on their hands,\" says Benjamin Franklin, \"do\r\nnot like to take the trouble to consider and carry into execution\r\nnew projects.\" This is a political law to which all governments\r\nconform. Even the great reforming administration of Gladstone which\r\ntook office in 1868, had earned five years later the famous jest of\r\nDisraeli: \"The ministers remind me of one of those marine landscapes\r\nnot very unusual off the coast of South America; you behold a range\r\nof extinct volcanoes; not a flame flickers upon a single pallid\r\ncrest.\"\r\n\r\nFifteen years of Liberal rule in Canada furnish a complete field for\r\nthe study of the party system under our system. In 1896 a party\r\nstale in spirit, corrupt and inefficient, went out of office and was\r\nreplaced by a government which had been bred to virtue by eighteen\r\nyears of political penury. It entered upon its tasks with vigor,\r\nability and enthusiasm. It had its policies well defined and it set\r\nbriskly about carrying them out. A deft, shrewd modification of the\r\ntariff helped to loosen the stream of commerce which after years of\r\nconstriction began again to flow freely. There was a courageous and\r\nconsidered increase in expenditures for productive objects. A\r\nconstructive, vigorously executed immigration policy brought an ever\r\nexpanding volume of suitable settlers to Western Canada which in\r\nturn fed the springs of national prosperity. This impulse lasted\r\nthrough the first parliamentary term and largely through the second,\r\nthough by then disruptive tendencies were appearing. By its third\r\nterm the government was mainly an office-holding administration on\r\nthe defensive against an opposition of growing effectiveness. And\r\nthen in the fourth term there was an attempt at a rally before the\r\ncrash. The treatment of the tariff question, always a governing\r\nfactor in Canadian politics even when apparently not in play, is an\r\nillustration of the government's progress towards stagnation. The\r\n1897 tariff revision \"could not,\" says Professor Skelton, \"have been\r\nbettered as a first preliminary step toward free trade.\"\r\n\"Unfortunately,\" he adds, \"it proved to be the last step save for\r\nthe 1911 attempt to secure reciprocity.\" After 1897 Laurier's policy\r\nwas to discourage the revival of the tariff question. Tarte's\r\noffence was partly that he did not realize that sleeping dogs should\r\nbe allowed to lie. \"It is not good politics to try to force the hand\r\nof the government,\" wrote Laurier to Tarte. And he added: \"The\r\nquestion of the tariff is in good shape if no one seeks to force the\r\nissue.\" With Tarte's ejection there followed nearly eight years\r\nduring which real tariff discussion was taboo. Then under the\r\npressure of the rising western resentment against the tariff\r\nburdens, the government turned to reciprocity as a means by which\r\nthey could placate the farmers without disturbing or alarming the\r\nmanufacturers. By what seemed extraordinary good luck the United\r\nStates president, Republican in politics, was by reason of domestic\r\npolitical developments, in favor of a reciprocal trade agreement. It\r\nseemed as though the Laurier government as by a miracle would renew\r\nits youth and vigor; but the situation, temporarily favorable, was\r\nso fumbled that it ended not in triumph but in defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disasters of the Laurier railway policy--or rather lack of\r\npolicy--must always weigh heavily against the undoubted achievements\r\nof the Laurier regime. A period of marked national expansion gave\r\nrise to all manner of railway ambitions and schemes, and Laurier\r\nlacked the practical capacity, foresight and determination to fit\r\nthem into a general, well-thought-out, practicable scheme of\r\ndevelopment. Again it was a case of letting the pressure of events\r\ndetermine policy, in place of policy controlling events. He could\r\nnot deny the Grand Trunk's ambitions, but he obliged it to submit to\r\nmodifications demanded by political pressure which turned its\r\nproject, perhaps practicable in its original form, into a huge,\r\nill-thought-out transcontinental enterprise. Equally he could not hold\r\nthe ambitions of Mann and McKenzie in check. The advisability of a\r\nmerger of these rival railway groups was obvious at the time, but\r\nLaurier let them each have their head, dividing government\r\nassistance between them, with resulting ruin to both and bequeathing\r\nto his successors a problem for which no solution has yet been found.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nDuring the years of his premiership Laurier rose steadily in\r\npersonal power and in prestige. It is in keeping with the genius of\r\nour party system that the leader who begins as the chosen chief of\r\nhis associates proceeds by stages, if he has the necessary\r\nqualities, to a position of dominance; the republic is transformed\r\ninto an absolute monarchy. In the government of 1896 Laurier was\r\nonly primus inter pares; his associates were in the main\r\ncontemporary with him in point of years and public service. Their\r\nplaces had been won by party recognition of their services and\r\nabilities. In the government of 1911 Laurier was the veteran\r\ncommander of a company which he had himself recruited. Of his 1896\r\ncolleagues but few remained, and of these only Mr. Fielding had kept\r\nhis relative rank in the party hierarchy. All his remaining\r\ncolleagues had entered public life long subsequent to his accession\r\nthe Liberal leadership. Not one had been in parliament prior to\r\n1896. Their entrance into public life, their steps in promotion,\r\ntheir admittance to the government were all subject to his approval,\r\nwhere they were not actually due to his will. To Laurier's authority\r\nthey yielded unquestioning obedience, and with it went a deep\r\naffection inspired and made sure by the personal consideration and\r\nkindliness that marked his relations with them. Under these\r\nconditions, men of strong, individual views and ambitions, with\r\nreforming temperaments and a desire to force issues, did not find\r\nthe road to the Privy Council open to them; different qualities held\r\nthe password.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 Sir Wilfrid, when a discerning electorate had deprived him\r\nof a colleague whose political incapacity had been completely\r\ndemonstrated, became a party to a deal by which he re-entered\r\nparliament. An old friend took the liberty of asking Sir Wilfrid why\r\nhe wanted this associate back in the cabinet, only to be told that\r\n\"So-and-So never made any trouble for me.\" At least twice in the last\r\nfour years of his regime Sir Wilfrid, conscious of the waning\r\nenergies of his party, took advice outside of his immediate circle\r\nas to what should be done; on both occasions he rejected advice\r\ntendered to him because this involved the inclusion in the cabinet\r\nof personalities that might have disturbed the charmed serenity of\r\nthat circle. Sir Wilfrid preferred to have things as they were,\r\nperhaps because his sense of reality warned him that, so far as the\r\nduration of time during which he would hold office was concerned,\r\nthere probably would not be any great difference between a\r\ngovernment wholly agreeable to him and one reconstituted to meet the\r\ndemand of the younger and more vigorous elements in the party. In\r\n1909, in a letter to a supporter who had lost the party nomination\r\nfor his constituency, he gave premonition of his own fate: \"What has\r\nhappened to you in your county will happen to me before long in\r\nCanada. Let us submit with good grace to the inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nThe inevitable end in the ordinary course of events would have been\r\nthe going on of the party until it died of dry rot and decay, as the\r\nLiberals had already died in Ontario; but fortunately, both for the\r\nparty and for Laurier's subsequent fame--though it may not have\r\nseemed so at the time--emergence of the reciprocity question gave\r\nit an opportunity to fall on an issue which seemed to link up the\r\nend of the regime with its heroic beginnings and to reinvest the\r\nparty with some of its lost glamor.\r\n\r\nLAURIER: DEFEAT AND ANTI-CLIMAX\r\n\r\nTHE defeat of the Liberals in September, 1911, raised sharply the\r\nquestion of the party's future and the leadership under which it\r\nwould face that future. Speaking at St. Jerome toward the close of\r\nthe campaign Sir Wilfrid had stated positively that if defeated he\r\nwould retire. This declaration of intention--no doubt at the moment\r\nsincerely made--was designed to check the falling away from\r\nLaurier's leadership in Quebec, which was becoming more noticeable\r\nas election day drew near. But the appeal was ineffective.. The\r\neffective opposition to Laurier in Quebec came not from Borden or\r\nfrom Monk, the official leader of the French Conservatives, but from\r\nBourassa. Laurier and his lieutenants fought desperately, but in\r\nvain, to break the strengthening hold of the younger man on the\r\nsympathies of the French electors. In Quebec the custom of the joint\r\nopen air political meeting is still popular, and at such a concourse\r\nin St. Hyacinthe, an old Liberal stronghold, Sir Wilfrid's\r\ncolleagues, Lemieux and Beland, met a notable defeat at the hands of\r\nBourassa--an incident which clearly revealed how the winds were\r\nblowing. Bourassa, fanatically \"nationalist\" in his convictions and\r\nfree from any political necessity to consider the reactions\r\nelsewhere of his doctrines, was outbidding Sir Wilfrid in the\r\nlatter's own field. Laurier received the news of the electoral\r\nresult in a hall in Quebec East, surrounded by the electors of the\r\nconstituency which had been faithful to him for 40 years. He\r\naccepted the blow with the tranquil fortitude which was his most\r\nnotable personal characteristic; but the feature in the disaster\r\nwhich must have made the greatest demand upon his stoicism was this\r\nindication that his old surbordinate and one time friend\r\nwas--apparently--about to supplant him in the leadership of his own\r\npeople. The election figures showed that whereas Laurier had carried\r\n49 seats in Quebec in 1896, 58 in 1900, 54 in 1904 and again in\r\n1908, he had been successful in only 38 constituencies against 27\r\nfor the Conservatives and Nationalists combined. Laurier, at the\r\nmoment of his defeat, was within two months of entering upon his\r\n70th year. He had been 40 years in public life; for 24 years leader\r\nof his party; for 15 years prime minister. He had had a long and\r\ndistinguished career; and he had gone out of office upon an issue\r\nwhich, with confidence, he counted upon time to vindicate. He had\r\nlong cherished a purpose to write a history of his times. The moment\r\nwas, therefore, opportune for retirement; and it must be assumed\r\nthat he gave some thought to the advisability or otherwise of living\r\nup to his St. Jerome pledge. But neither his own inclination nor the\r\ndesire of his followers pointed to retirement; and the next session\r\nof parliament found him in the seat he had occupied twenty years\r\nbefore as leader of the opposition. The party demand for his\r\ncontinuance in the leadership was virtually unanimous. There was\r\nonly one possible successor to Sir Wilfrid--Mr. Fielding. But he was\r\nnot in parliament. Also he was in disfavour as the general whose\r\ndefensive plan of campaign had ended in disaster. His name suggested\r\n\"Reciprocity\"--a word the Liberals were quite willing, for the time\r\nbeing, to forget. He was left to lie where he had fallen. For some\r\nyears he lived in political obscurity, and it was only the emergence\r\nof the Unionist movement which made possible his re-entrance to\r\npublic life and his later career.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF LIBERAL HOPES\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Wilfrid resumed the leadership after the formality of\r\ntendering his resignation to the party caucus it meant, in fact,\r\nthat he intended to die in the saddle. Thereafter Sir Wilfrid talked\r\nmuch about the inexpediency of continuing in the leadership, and\r\noften used language foreshadowing his resignation--indeed the\r\nletters quoted by Professor Skelton in the latter chapters of his\r\nbook abound in these intimations--but these came to be regarded by\r\nthose in the know as portents: implying an intention to insist upon\r\npolicies to which objections were likely to develop within the party.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the severity of their defeat--they were in a\r\nminority of 45 in the House--the Liberals in opposition showed a\r\ngood fighting front, and ere long hope revived. The Borden\r\ngovernment found itself in difficulties from the moment of taking\r\noffice--largely by reason of the tactics by which Laurier's\r\nsupremacy in Quebec had been undermined. The Nationalist chiefs\r\ndeclined an invitation to enter the government, but they controlled\r\nthe Quebec appointments to the cabinet, and thus assumed a\r\nquasi-responsibility for the new government's policy. The result was\r\ndisastrous to them; for the Borden government, subject to the\r\ninfluences that had enabled it to sweep Ontario, could not concern\r\nitself with the preservation of Bourassa's fortunes. The extension\r\nof the Manitoba boundaries was a blow to the Nationalists; they\r\nfailed in their efforts to preserve the educational rights of the\r\nminority in the added territory. Laurier had evaded this issue;\r\nBorden could not evade it, and by its settlement Bourassa was\r\ndamaged. Still more disastrous to the Nationalist cause was the\r\nnaval policy which Mr. Borden submitted to Parliament in the session\r\nof 1912-1913. There was in its presentation an ingenious attempt to\r\nreconcile the irreconcilable which deceived nobody. The contribution\r\nof the three largest dreadnoughts that could be built was to satisfy\r\nthe Conservatives; the Nationalists were expected to be placated by\r\nthe assurance that this contribution was merely to meet an\r\nemergency, leaving over for later consideration the question of a\r\npermanent naval policy. But all the circumstances attending the\r\nsetting out of the policy--the report of the admiralty, the letters\r\nof Mr. Churchill, the speeches by which it was supported with their\r\ninsistence upon the need for common naval and foreign policies--made\r\nit only too clear that it marked the abandonment of the Canadian\r\nnaval policy which had been entered upon only four years before with\r\nthe consent of all parties and the acceptance in principle of the\r\nRound Table view of the Imperial problem. Laurier challenged the\r\nproposition whole-heartedly. Here was familiar fighting ground. From\r\nthe moment they joined battle with the government the Liberals found\r\ntheir strength growing. They were indubitably on firm ground. They\r\nwere helped mightily by Mr. Churchill's attempted intervention in\r\nwhich he belittled Canadian capacity in a manner worthy of Downing\r\nstreet in its palmiest days. Mr. Churchill had the bright idea of\r\ncoming to Canada to take a hand personally in the controversy. A\r\nCanadian-born member of the British House of Commons sounded out\r\nvarious Canadians as to the nature of the reception Mr. Churchill\r\nwould receive. Mr. Churchill did not come--fortunately for the\r\ngovernment. The Liberals fought the proposition so furiously in the\r\nCommons that the government had to introduce closure to secure its\r\npassage through the commons, whereupon the Liberal majority in the\r\nSenate threw it out. The Liberal policy was to challenge the\r\ngovernment to submit the issue to the people in a general election.\r\nThat within eighteen months from the date of their disastrous defeat\r\nthe Liberals should invite a second trial of strength spoke of\r\nrapidly reviving confidence. The government ignored the challenge,\r\nfor very good reasons. In the sequel Laurier, as with all his\r\npolicies having to deal with Imperial questions, was amply\r\njustified. The policy of Dominion navies was never again seriously\r\nquestioned in Canada; when admiralty officials, true to form,\r\nchallenged it in 1918 it was Sir Robert Borden who defended it, to\r\nsome purpose.\r\n\r\nThese developments were fatal to Quebec Nationalism as a distinct\r\npolitical force under the direction of Mr. Bourassa. The ideas that\r\ninspired it did not lapse. Nor did Mr. Bourassa, as apostle of these\r\nideas, lose his personal eminence. But the electors in sympathy with\r\nthese ideals began to develop views of their own as to the political\r\naction required by the times. Their alliance with the Conservatives\r\nhad brought them no satisfaction. They had ejected the most eminent\r\nliving French-Canadian from the premiership to the very evident\r\ninjury of Quebec's influence in Confederation--that about\r\nrepresented the sum of their achievements. The thought that they had\r\nbeen on the wrong track began to grow in their minds. The conditions\r\nmaking for the creation of the Quebec bloc were developing. The\r\ndisposition was to get together under a common leadership. It was\r\nstill a question as to whether, in the long run, that leader should\r\nbe Laurier or Bourassa; but all the conditions favored Laurier. For\r\none thing, he could command a large body of support outside of his\r\nown province which it was quite beyond the power of Bourassa to\r\nduplicate. The swing to Laurier was so marked that by 1914 the\r\nconfident prediction was made by good political judges that if there\r\nwere an election Laurier would carry 60 out of the 65 seats in\r\nQuebec. Such a vote meant victory. Sir Wilfrid was slow in coming to\r\nbelieve that an early reversal of the decision of 1911 was possible;\r\nbut finally found himself infected with the hopefulness of his\r\nfollowing. Hard times became a powerful ally of the Liberals and the\r\ngovernment suffered from the first shock of the impending railway\r\ncollapse. The course of the party lay clear before it; it was to see\r\nthat the conditions in Quebec remained favorable and to await, with\r\npatience, the coming of an election which would reopen the doors to\r\noffice. But not too much patience, for the years were slipping past.\r\nLaurier was in his 73rd year.\r\n\r\nTHE PARTIES AND THE WAR\r\n\r\nSuch were the political conditions: a government in a position of\r\ngrowing doubtfulness and a combative and confident opposition--when\r\nCanada found herself plunged over night into the Great War. Under\r\nthe high emotion of this venture into the unknown politics vanished\r\nfor a brief moment from the land. If that moment could have been\r\nseized for a sacred union of hearts dedicated to the great task of\r\ncarrying on the war how different would the whole future of Canada\r\nhave been! In the fires of war our sectional and racial intractibilities\r\nmight have been fused into an enduring alliance. But Canadian\r\nstatesmanship was not equal to the opportunity. For this\r\nSir Wilfrid has no accountability. There is no question of the\r\ncorrectness and generosity of his attitude as revealed in the war\r\nsession of August, 1914. From a speech in the next session it might\r\nbe inferred that he would have gone farther than he did if overtures\r\nhad been made to him.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, as elsewhere, the war spelt opportunity for more than the\r\npatriot and the hero. The schemer, resolute to make the war serve\r\nhis ends, appeared everywhere. From the morrow of those first days\r\nof high exaltation the two currents ran side by side in Canada: the\r\nclear tide of valor and self-sacrifice, the muddy stream of\r\ncowardice and self-seeking. There was an influential element in the\r\ndominant party which was determined to exploit the war to the limit\r\nfor political and personal interests. The war meant patronage; it\r\nmust be placed where it would do the most party good. It meant an\r\nopportunity for artificial and perfectly safe distinction; this must\r\nbe employed for increasing the political availability of friends.\r\nPolitical colonels began to adorn the landscape. It meant a corking\r\ngood issue upon which an election could be won; why not take\r\nadvantage of it? While the government officially was leading a\r\nunited people into action, these scheming political profiteers were\r\nperfecting their plans for appealing to the people on the ground\r\nthat the government--a party government which had not invited any\r\nmeasure of close co-operation from the opposition--must have a\r\nmandate to carry on the war. There is a quite authentic story of a\r\nleading Canadian being cheered up on a train journey by assurances\r\nfrom a travelling companion, a friend holding high office, that\r\nevents were shaping for certain victory; until he learned that the\r\nenemy about to be defeated was the \"damn Grits.\" The battle of Ypres\r\nin April, 1915, saved Canada from an ignoble general election on the\r\nmeanest of issues. Though some of the conspirators still pressed for\r\nan election, it soon became apparent that the proposal was abhorrent\r\nto public opinion. Canadians could not bring themselves to the point\r\nof fighting one another while their sons and brothers were dying\r\nside by side in the mud of Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe danger of a profound division of the Canadian people in war-time\r\npassed; but irretrievable damage had been done to the cause of\r\nnational unity. In considering subsequent events these unhappy\r\ndevelopments of the first year of the war cannot be overlooked.\r\nParty feeling among the Liberals had been held in leash with\r\ndifficulty; now it was running free again. The attitude of the party\r\ntowards the government was in effect: \"You have tried to play\r\npolitics with the war; very well, you will find that this is a game\r\nthat two can play at.\" The strategy looking to a future trial of\r\nstrength was skilfully planned. There was no challenge to the\r\ngovernment plans. It was given full liberty of action upon the\r\nunderstanding that it would accept full responsibility and be\r\nprepared to render an account in due time to parliament and people.\r\nThe tactics were those of paying out the rope as the government\r\ncalled for it. The attitude of the Liberal leaders towards the war\r\nwas unexceptionable. Sir Wilfrid's recruiting speeches--and he made\r\nmany of them--were admirable; and he did not hesitate to point the\r\nway of duty to the young men of his own province. Upon things done\r\nor not done the attitude of the parliamentary Liberals was\r\nincreasingly critical; and the government, it must be said, with its\r\nscandals over supplies, its favoritism in recruiting, its beloved\r\nRoss rifle, gave plenty of opportunity to opposition critics. With\r\nevery month that passed the political advantage that had come to the\r\ngovernment, because it was charged with the task of making war,\r\nwaned.\r\n\r\nGeneral elections were due in the autumn of 1916. It became a\r\nserious question of Liberal policy to decide between agreeing to an\r\nextension of the life of parliament, which the government intended\r\nto request, and the forcing of an election. Two lieutenants of Sir\r\nWilfrid toured Western Canada sounding Liberal opinion; their\r\ndisappointment was obvious when, in a conference with a group of\r\nLiberals in Winnipeg, they found opinion solidly adverse to an\r\nelection. Their reasons for an election were plainly stated--in\r\nbrief they were that on the details of its war management the\r\ngovernment could be, and, in their judgement, should be, beaten. But\r\nSir Wilfrid, with his hand on the country's pulse, could not be\r\nstampeded. He saw, more clearly than his lieutenants, the danger to\r\nthe party of refusing an extension at that time. A twelve months was\r\nadded to the life of parliament with a reservation in the minds of\r\nthe Liberals that the first extension would be the last. This meant\r\nan election in 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONALISTS AND ONTARIO\r\n\r\nMr. Bourassa was acutely conscious of the development of opinion in\r\nQuebec favorable to the Liberals, and he sought to retain his hold\r\nupon his following by the tactics which in the first place had given\r\nhim his following--by going to extremes and outbidding Laurier. The\r\nchief article in the Nationalist creed was that Canada was\r\neverywhere a bilingual country, French being on an equality with\r\nEnglish in all the provinces. This contention rested upon a\r\nconglomeration of arguments, assertions, assumptions, inferences,\r\nand it was backed by thinly disguised threats of political action.\r\nThe opposing contention that bilingualism had a legal basis only in\r\nQuebec and in the Dominion parliament with its services and courts\r\nwas interpreted as an insult. Mr. Lavergne, the chief lieutenant of\r\nMr. Bourassa, was wont to wax furiously indignant over the\r\nsuggestion, as he put it, that he must \"stay on the reservation\" if\r\nhe was to enjoy the privileges that he held to be equally his in\r\nwhatever part of Canada he might find himself.\r\n\r\nEvents in Ontario put the test of reality to the Nationalist\r\ntheories. A feud broke out between the English-speaking and the\r\nFrench-speaking Catholics over the language used for instruction in\r\nseparate schools where both languages were represented; and\r\nresulting investigation revealed a state of affairs suggesting\r\nsomething very like a conspiracy to minimize or even abolish the use\r\nof English in all school areas where the French were in control.\r\nResulting regulations and legislation intended to put a stop to\r\nthese conditions gave French a definitely subordinate status. This\r\nfired the heather, and later somewhat similar action by Manitoba\r\nadded fuel to the flames. The Nationalist agitation was resumed with\r\nincreased vehemence in Quebec; and the Ontario minority were\r\nencouraged to defy the regulations by assurances that means would be\r\nfound to bring Ontario to time. In addition to legal action (which\r\nbrought in the end a finding by the Privy Council completely\r\ndestroying the Nationalist claim that bilingualism was implied in\r\nthe scheme of Confederation) various ingenious attempts were made to\r\napply pressure to Ontario. The most daring, and in results the most\r\ndisastrous, was the threat that if Ontario did not remove the\r\n\"grievances of the minority\" the people of Quebec would go on strike\r\nagainst further participation in the war. That dangerous doctrine\r\noperating upon a popular mind impregnated with suspicion of the\r\nmotives and intentions behind Canada's war activities, produced the\r\nsituation which made inevitable the developments of 1917. The\r\nmovement against Ontario was Nationalist in its spirit, its\r\ninspiration and its direction. Side by side with it went a\r\nNationalist agitation of ever-increasing boldness against the war.\r\nAmmunition for this campaign was readily found in the imputations,\r\ninnuendoes, charges, mendacities of the Labor and pacifist\r\nextremists of Great Britain and France; they lost none of their\r\nmalignancy in the retelling. Bourassa included Laurier in the scope\r\nof his denunciations. Laurier's loyal support of the war and his\r\ncandid admonitions to the young men of his own race made him the\r\ntarget for Bourassa's shafts. Something more than a difference of\r\nview was reflected in Bourassa's harangues; there was in them a\r\ndistillation of venom, indicating deep personal feeling. \"Laurier,\"\r\nhe once declared in a public meeting, \"is the most nefarious man in\r\nthe whole of Canada.\" Bourassa hated Laurier. Laurier had too\r\nmagnanimous a mind to cherish hate; but he feared Bourassa with a\r\nfear which in the end became an obsession. He feared him because, if\r\nhe only retained his position in Quebec, Liberal victory in the\r\ncoming Dominion elections would not be possible. Laurier feared him\r\nstill more because if Bourassa increased his hold upon the people,\r\nwhich was the obvious purpose of the raging, tearing Nationalist\r\npropaganda, he would be displaced from his proud position as the\r\nfirst and greatest of French-Canadians. Far more than a temporary\r\nterm of power was at stake. It was a struggle for a niche in the\r\ntemple of fame. It was a battle not only for the affection of the\r\nliving generation, but for place in the historic memories of the\r\nrace. Laurier, putting aside the weight of 75 years and donning his\r\narmor for his last fight, had two definite purposes: to win back, if\r\nhe could, the prime ministership of Canada; but in any event to\r\nestablish his position forever as the unquestioned, unchallenged\r\nleader of his own people. In this campaign--which covered the two\r\nyears from the moment he consented to one year's extension of the\r\nlife of parliament until election day in 1917--he had repeatedly to\r\nmake a choice between his two purposes; and he invariably preferred\r\nthe second. In the sequel he missed the premiership; but he very\r\ndefinitely accomplished his second desire. He died the unquestioned\r\nleader, the idol of his people; and it may well be that as the\r\ncenturies pass he will become the legendary embodiment of the\r\nrace--like King Arthur of the English awaiting in the Isle of Avalon the\r\nsummons of posterity. As for Bourassa, he may live in Canadian\r\nhistory as Douglas lives in the history of the United States--by\r\nreason of his relations with the man he fought.\r\n\r\nTHE BILINGUAL EPISODE\r\n\r\nThe Canadian house of commons was the vantage point from which Sir\r\nWilfrid carried on the operations by which he unhorsed Bourassa.\r\nHere we find the explanation of much that appears inexplicable in\r\nthe political events of 1916 and 1917. Laurier was out to\r\ndemonstrate that he was the true champion of Quebec's views and\r\ninterests, because he could rally to her cause the support of a\r\ngreat national party. Hence the remarkable projection of the\r\nbilingual issue into the proceeding of parliament in May, 1916. The\r\nquestion as an Ontario one could only be dealt with by the Ontario\r\nauthorities once it was admitted--Sir Wilfrid being in agreement--that\r\ndisallowance was not possible. Yet Sir Wilfrid brought the\r\nissue into the Dominion parliament. If he had done this merely for\r\nthe purpose of making his own attitude of sympathy with his\r\ncompatriots in Ontario clear, the course would have been of doubtful\r\npolitical wisdom, in view of his responsibilities to the party he\r\nled. But he insisted upon a formal resolution being submitted.\r\nProfessor Skelton, in the passages dealing with this episode, shows\r\nhim whipping up a reluctant party and compelling it, by every\r\ninfluence he could command, to follow him. The writer, arriving in\r\nOttawa when this situation was developing, was informed by a\r\nleading Liberal member of parliament that the \"old man\" had thought\r\nout a wonderful stroke of tactics by which he was going to\r\nstrengthen himself in Quebec and at the same time do no harm in\r\nOntario--a feat beside which squaring the circle would be child's\r\nplay. Very brief enquiry revealed the situation. Sir Wilfrid was\r\ndetermined to have a resolution and a vote. The western Liberals\r\nwere in revolt; the Ontario Liberals were reluctant but were\r\nprepared to be coerced; most of the maritime province Liberals were\r\nobedient, but there was a minority strongly opposed. Theoretically\r\nthe formula that there was to be no coercion, each member voting as\r\nhis conscience directed, was honored; but Sir Wilfrid had found it\r\nnecessary to indicate that if in the outcome it should be found that\r\nany considerable number of his supporters were not in agreement with\r\nhim, he would be obliged to interpret this as indicating that the\r\nparty no longer had confidence in him. Professor Skelton supplies\r\nthe evidence that Sir Wilfrid pressed the threat to resign almost to\r\nthe breaking point. He actually wrote out something which was\r\nsupposed to be a resignation before the Ontario Liberals\r\ncapitulated. The western Liberals were of sterner stuff; they stood\r\nto their guns. No resignation followed. \"The defection of the\r\nwestern Liberals,\" says Professor Skelton, \"forced from Sir Wilfrid\r\na rare outbreak of anger.\" The use of the word \"defection\" is\r\nenlightening, as showing Professor Skelton's attitude towards the\r\nLiberals who in those trying times adhered to their convictions\r\nagainst the party whip. He is a thorough-going partisan, which, in\r\nan official biographer, is perhaps the right thing.\r\n\r\nThe writer's activities in encouraging opposition to these party\r\ntactics led to a long interview with Sir Wilfrid, in which there was\r\nconsiderable frank language used on both sides. Sir Wilfrid gave\r\nevery indication that he was profoundly moved by what he called \"the\r\nplight of the French-Canadians of Ontario.\" They were, he said,\r\npolitically powerless and leaderless; the provincial Liberal\r\nleaders, who should have been their champions, had abandoned them;\r\nthe obligation rested upon him to come to their rescue. The\r\nsuggestion that, while he might be within his rights in thus\r\nexpressing his individual views, he should not seek to make it a\r\nparty matter in view of the strong differences of opinion within the\r\nparty, was rather impatiently brushed aside. Still less respect was\r\nshown the observation that it was not desirable that the Liberal\r\nparty should identify itself with a resolution the carrying of which\r\nmeant a general election in the height of the war upon a race and\r\nreligious issue. Sir Wilfrid, in the course of the conversation,\r\ntouched quite frankly upon the necessities of the Quebec political\r\nsituation. He advanced the argument, which was put forward so\r\npersistently a year later, that it must be made possible for him to\r\nkeep control of Quebec province, since the only alternative was the\r\ntriumph of Bourassa extremism, which might involve the whole\r\nDominion in conflict and ruin.\r\n\r\nThe episode passed apparently without disruptive results; but\r\nsurface indications were misleading. In reality a heavy blow had\r\nbeen struck at the unity of the Liberal party; there began to be\r\nquestionings in unexpected quarters of the Laurier leadership. What\r\nhad happened was only too clear, to those who looked at the\r\nsituation steadily. Party policy had been shaped with a single eye\r\nto Quebec necessities; and party feeling, party discipline, the\r\npersonal authority of Laurier has been drawn on heavily to secure\r\nacceptance of this policy by Liberals who did not favor it. But\r\nthere is in politics, as in economics, a law of diminishing returns.\r\nA year later the same tactics applied to a situation of greater\r\ngravity ended in disaster. The split which came in 1917 followed\r\npretty exactly the split that would have come in 1916 over\r\nbilingualism, had the Liberal members not been constrained by their\r\ndevotion to party regularity to vote against their convictions.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVEMENT FOR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe movement for national government long antedated the emergence of\r\nthe issue of conscription; it was, in its origin, Liberal. Its most\r\npersistent advocates in the later months of 1916 and the opening\r\nmonths of 1917 were Liberal newspapers, among them the Manitoba Free\r\nPress; and there was an answer from the public which showed that the\r\nappeal for a union of all Canadians who were concerned with \"getting\r\non with the war\" made a deep appeal to popular feeling. The most\r\ndetermined resistance came from the Conservatives. The ministerial\r\npress could see nothing in it but a Grit scheme to break up the\r\nBorden government, which they lauded as being in itself a \"national\r\ngovernment\" of incomparable merit. But that movement was equally\r\ndisconcerting to the Liberal strategists since it threatened to\r\ninterfere with their plans for a battle, to end, as they confidently\r\nbelieved, in a Liberal victory. In January, 1917, Sir Wilfrid could\r\nsee nothing in the movement but an attempt to prevent a French-Canadian\r\nfrom succeeding to the premiership, and wrote in those terms\r\nto N. W. Rowell.\r\n\r\nAn offer by Sir Robert Borden to Sir Wilfrid Laurier to join him in a\r\nnational government would have been unwelcome at any time excepting\r\nperhaps in the first months in the war; but in the form in which it\r\nfinally came, in May, 1918, it was trebly unacceptable. Sir Wilfrid\r\nwas asked to help in the formation of a national government to put\r\ninto effect a policy of conscription, already determined upon.\r\nAlthough history will no doubt confirm the bona fides of Sir\r\nRobert's offer, it cannot but be lenient to Sir Wilfrid's\r\ninterpretation of it as a political stroke intended to disrupt the\r\nLiberal party and rob him of the premiership. From his viewpoint it\r\nmust have had exactly that appearance. Laurier's position in Quebec\r\nhad been undermined in the years preceding the war by the\r\nNationalist charge that his naval and military policies implied\r\nunlimited participation, by means of conscription, in future\r\nImperial wars. He had always denied this; and when Canada entered\r\nthe great war he, to keep his record clear, was careful to declare\r\nover and over again that Canadian participation by the people\r\ncollectively, and by the individual, was and would remain voluntary.\r\nAs the strain of the war increased the feeling in Quebec in its\r\nfavor, never very strong, grew less. There began to be echoes of\r\nBourassa's open anti-war crusade in the Liberal party and press. Sir\r\nWilfrid, watching with alert patience the development of Quebec\r\nopinion, began cautiously to replace his earlier whole-hearted\r\nrecognition of the supreme need of defeating Germany at all costs by\r\na cooler survey of the situation in which considerations of prudent\r\nnational self-interest were deftly suggested. The \"We-have-done-enough\"\r\nview was beginning to prevail; and Laurier, intent upon the\r\ncomplete capture of Quebec at the impending elections, while he did\r\nnot subscribe to it, found it discreet to hint that it might be\r\ndesirable to begin to think about the wisdom of not too greatly\r\ndepleting our reserves of national labor. To Laurier, thus engaged\r\nin formulating a cautious war policy against the day of voting, came\r\nthe invitation from Borden to join him in a movement to keep the\r\narmies of Canada in the field up to strength by the enforcement of\r\nconscription. Every aspect of the proposition was objectionable to\r\nLaurier. It meant handing back to Bourassa the legions he had won\r\nfrom him, and with them many of his own followers. No one was\r\njustified in believing that Laurier with all his prestige and power\r\ncould commend conscription to more than a minority of his\r\ncompatriots. Sir Robert Borden's proposal meant the foregoing of the\r\nanticipated party victory at the polls, the renouncement of the\r\npremiership, and the loss, certainly for the immediate future and\r\nprobably for all time, of the affection and regard of his own people\r\nas a body. The proposition doubtless looked to him weird and\r\nimpossible, and not a little impudent. The argument that the\r\nproposed government could better serve the general interests of the\r\npublic, or even the cause of the war, than a purely Liberal\r\ngovernment, of which he would be the head, probably struck him as\r\npresumptuous. Three days before Sir Robert Borden made his\r\nannouncement of an intention to introduce conscription, Sir Wilfrid,\r\nanticipating the announcement, wrote to Sir Allan Aylesworth his\r\nunalterable opposition to the policy. This being the case, there\r\nnever was a chance that Laurier would entertain Borden's offer to\r\njoin him in a national government.\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERAL DISRUPTION\r\n\r\nSir Wilfrid, rejecting Borden's offer, adhered to his plan of an\r\nelection on party lines; but he knew that conditions had been\r\npowerfully affected by these developments. His position in Quebec\r\nwas now secure and unchallenged--even Bourassa, recognizing the\r\nlogic of the situation, commended Laurier's leadership to his\r\nfollowers. If he could hold his following in the English provinces\r\nsubstantially intact the result was beyond question. He set himself\r\nresolutely to the task. Thereafter the situation developed with all\r\nthe inevitableness of a Greek tragedy to the final catastrophe. Sir\r\nWilfrid surveyed the field with the wisdom and experience of the\r\nveteran commander, and from the disposition of his forces and the\r\nlay of the land he foresaw victory. But he overlooked the\r\nimponderables. Forces were abroad which he did not understand and\r\nwhich, when he met them, he could not control. He counted upon the\r\nstrength of party feeling, upon his extraordinary position of moral\r\nauthority in the party, upon his personal hold upon thousands of\r\ninfluential Liberals in every section of Canada, upon the lure of a\r\nvictory which seemed inevitable, upon the widespread and justified\r\nresentment among the Liberals against the government for things done\r\nand undone to keep the party intact through the ardors of an\r\nelection. One thing he would not do; he would not deviate by an inch\r\nfrom the course he had marked out. Repeated and unavailing efforts\r\nwere made to find some formula by which a disruption of the party\r\nmight be avoided. One such proposition was that the life of the\r\nparliament should be extended. This would enable the government,\r\nwith its majority and the support it would get from conscriptionist\r\nLiberals, to carry out its programme accepting full responsibility\r\ntherefor. Sir Wilfrid rejected this; an election there must be. This\r\nwas probably the only expedient which held any prospects of avoiding\r\nparty disruption; but after its rejection Liberals in disagreement\r\nwith Laurier still sought for an accommodation. There was a\r\ncontinuous conference going on for weeks in which all manner of\r\nsuggestions were made. They all broke down before Laurier's\r\ncourteous but unyielding firmness. There was the suggestion that the\r\nLiberals should accept the second reading of the Military Service\r\nAct and then on the third reading demand a referendum; rejected on\r\nthe ground that this would imply a conditional acceptance of the\r\nprinciple of compulsion. There was the proposal that Laurier should\r\nengage, if returned to power, to resort to conscription if voluntary\r\nrecruiting did not reach a stipulated level--not acceptable. Scores\r\nof men had the experience of the writer; going into Laurier's room\r\non the third floor of the improvised parliamentary offices in the\r\nNational History Museum, spending an hour or so in fruitless\r\ndiscussion and coming out with the feeling that there was no choice\r\nbetween unquestioning acceptance of Laurier's policy or breaking\r\naway from allegiance to him. Not that Laurier ever proposed this\r\nchoice to his visitors. He had a theory--which not even he with all\r\nhis lucidity could make intelligible--that a man could support both\r\nhim and conscription at the same time. There is an attempt at\r\ndefining this policy in a curious letter to Wm. Martin, then premier\r\nof Saskatchewan, which is quoted by Skelton. Sir Wilfrid in these\r\nconversations--as in his letters of that period, many of which\r\nappear in Skelton's Life--never failed to stress conditions in Quebec\r\nas compelling the course which he followed; the alternative was to\r\nthrow Quebec to the extremists, with a resulting division that might\r\nbe fatal. There was, too, the mournful and repeated assertion--which\r\nabounds also in his letters--that these developments showed that it\r\nwas a mistake for a member of the minority to be the leader of the\r\nparty. At the close of the session, when it became increasingly\r\nevident that a party split was impending, there were reports that\r\nLaurier proposed to make way for a successor upon some basis which\r\nmight make an accommodation between the two wings of the party\r\npossible; and there was an attempt by a small group of Liberal\r\nM.P.'s to bring this about. The treatment of this incident in\r\nProfessor Skelton's volume is obscure. In any case it had no\r\nsignificance and it came to nothing. Laurier alike by choice and\r\nnecessity retained the leadership.\r\n\r\nSir Wilfrid misjudged, all through the piece, the temper and purpose\r\nof the Liberals who dissented from his policy. For his own courses\r\nand actions there was a political reason; he looked for the\r\npolitical reasons behind the actions of those in disagreement with\r\nhim. He found what he looked for, not in the actual facts of the\r\nsituation but in his imagination. He saw conversion to the Round\r\nTable view of the Imperial problem and the acceptance of dictation\r\nfrom London--a very wild shot this! He saw political ambition. He\r\nsaw unworthy desires to forward personal and business ends. But he\r\ndid not see what was plain to view--that the whole movement was\r\nderived from an intense conviction on the part of growing numbers of\r\nLiberals that united national action was necessary if Canada was to\r\nmake the maximum contribution to the war. There was very little\r\nfeeling against Sir Wilfrid--rather a sympathetic understanding of\r\nthe position in which he found himself; but they were wholly out of\r\nagreement with his view that Canada was in the war on a limited\r\nliability basis. In the very height of the controversy Sir Wilfrid\r\ncould not be got to go beyond saying that Canada should make\r\nenquiries as to how many men she could afford to spare from her\r\nindustries and these she should send if they could be induced\r\nvoluntarily to enlist. This was wholly unsatisfactory to those who\r\nheld that Canada was a principal in the war, and must shrink from no\r\nsacrifices to make victory possible. Still less satisfactory was the\r\nprofessed attitude of the Liberal candidates in Quebec; with few\r\nexceptions they embraced the anti-war Nationalist programme. It\r\nbecame only too evident that a Liberal victory would mean a\r\ngovernment dependent upon and controlled by a Quebec bloc pretty\r\nthoroughly committed to the view that Canada had \"done enough.\" For\r\nthose committed to the prosecution of the war to the limit,\r\nconscription became a test and a symbol; and ultimately the pressure\r\nforced reluctant politicians to come together in the Union\r\ngovernment. There followed the general election and the Unionist\r\nsweep. Laurier returned to parliament with a following of eighty-two\r\nin a house of 235. Of these 62 came from Quebec; and nine from the\r\nMaritime provinces. From the whole vast expanse from the Ottawa\r\nriver to the Pacific Ocean ten lone Liberals were elected; of these\r\nonly two represented the west, that part of Canada where Liberal\r\nideas grow most naturally and freely. The policy of shaping national\r\nprogrammes to meet sectional predilections, relying upon party\r\ndiscipline and the cultivation of personal loyalties to serve as\r\nsubstitutes elsewhere had run its full course--and this was the\r\nharvest!\r\n\r\nTHE LAST YEAR\r\n\r\nThe events of 1917 were both an end and a beginning in Canada's\r\npolitical development. They brought to a definite close what might\r\nbe called the era of the Great Parties. Viscount Bryce, in a work\r\nbased upon pre-war observations, in dealing with Canadian political\r\nconditions, said:\r\n\r\n\"Party (in Canada) seems to exist for its own sake. In Canada ideas\r\nare not needed to make parties, for these can live by heredity, and,\r\nlike the Guelfs and Ghibellines of mediaeval Italy, by memories of\r\npast combats; attachment to leaders of such striking gifts and long\r\ncareers as were Sir John Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, created\r\na personal loyalty which exposed a man to reproach as a deserter\r\nwhen he voted against his party.\"\r\n\r\nFor these conditions there were reasons in our history. Our parties\r\nonce expressed deep divergencies of view upon issues of vital\r\nimport; and each had experienced an individual leadership that had\r\ncalled forth and had stereotyped feelings of unbounded personal\r\ndevotion. The chiefships of Laurier and Macdonald overlapped by only\r\nfour years, but they were of the same political generation and they\r\nadhered to the same tradition. The resemblances in their careers,\r\noften commented upon, arose from a common attitude towards the\r\nbusiness of political management. They conceived their parties as\r\nstates within the state. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say\r\nthey conceived them as co-ordinate with the state. Of these\r\nprincipalities they were the chieftains, chosen in the first place\r\nby election--as kings often were in the old times; but thereafter\r\nholding their positions by virtue of personal right and having the\r\npower in the last analysis by their own acts to determine party\r\npolicy and to enforce discipline. Their personalities made these\r\nassumptions of power appear not only inevitable, but proper.\r\nPersonal charm, human qualities of sympathy and understanding; an\r\ninflexible will which, except in crises, worked by indirection; the\r\nprestige of office and the glamor of victory; and the accretions of\r\npower which came from the passage of time--half their followers\r\ntowards the end of their careers could not remember when other suns\r\nshone in the firmament; all these influences helped to transform\r\nparty feeling into that blind worship which drew from Viscount Bryce\r\nhis mordant comment.\r\n\r\nThis venerable but archaic political system did not survive the war.\r\nBeside the loyalties inspired by the war tribal devotion to a party\r\nchief seemed a trivial concern. Canadians, who gave first place to\r\nthe need of getting on with the war, viewed with consternation the\r\nreadiness of elements in both parties to put their political\r\ninterests above the safety and honor of the commonwealth. The\r\nmovement for national political unity was born of their concern and\r\nindignation. This development was almost as displeasing to the\r\nConservative partisans as to the Liberal \"legitimists,\" who upheld\r\nthe right, under all circumstances, of Laurier to regain the\r\npremiership; and it was their inveterate and unthinking opposition\r\nthat had much to do with the ultimate disruption of the union. They\r\ndid not realize, until they got into the elections of 1921, that\r\ntheir party had disintegrated under the stresses of war.\r\n\r\nA study of the origin, achievements, failures, downfall and\r\nconsequences of Union government might be of interest, but it does\r\nnot come into a survey of the life of Laurier. These matters are\r\nrelated to the influences that are now making over Canadian\r\npolitics; they concern the leaders of to-day, all minor figures in\r\nthe 1917 drama. Because the Union government passed without leaving\r\nbehind it tangible and visible manifestations of its power, there\r\nare those who regard it as a mere futility--a sword-cut in the\r\nwater, as the French say. But of the Union movement it might well be\r\nsaid: Si monumentum requiris circumspice. The spirit behind the\r\nmovement passed with the war, but it left the old traditional party\r\nsystem in ruins. The readjustments that are going on to-day, the\r\nefforts at the realignment of parties, the attempt to newly appraise\r\npolitical values, and to redefine political relationships--all these\r\nthings are testimony to the dissolving, penetrating power of the\r\nimpulses of 1917.\r\n\r\nBut the task of attempting political reconstruction in a new world\r\nwas not imposed upon Laurier. The signing of the armistice was the\r\nsignal for the release of new forces; it was a great turning point\r\nin the world's history. But for Laurier the tale of his years was\r\ntold. There was something fitting in the departure of the veteran\r\nwith the turning of the tide. He had been a mere survival on the\r\nscene following the elections of 1917 which put into the hands of\r\nthe Union government a mandate to \"carry on\" for the remainder of\r\nthe war--which at that time gave promise of stretching out\r\ninterminably. That election set bounds to his ambitions, wrote finis\r\nto his political career. \"Unarm; the long day's work is o'er.\" He\r\ncontinued to hold his rank in a party which waited upon events,\r\nknowing that the task of rebuilding and reconstruction must fall to\r\nyounger hands. The serenity of mind which had sustained him in all\r\nthe changes of a long and varied life did not desert him; and he\r\nlooked forward with fortitude to the end now approaching. He had\r\ncome a long way from the humble beginnings in St. Lin, 77 years\r\nbefore. Childhood; happy, carefree boyhood; a youth of gallant\r\ncomradeship with the young swordsmen of a fighting political army;\r\nthe ardors of a career in the making full of delights of battle with\r\nhis peers; the call to the command; the conquest of the premiership;\r\nthe long, crowded, brilliant years of office with their deep\r\nanxieties, crushing responsibilities, great satisfactions,\r\nsubstantial achievements; the bitterness of unexpected defeat; the\r\ngallant fight to win back to power ending by a stroke of fate in\r\ndisaster; the final disruption of his party and the loss of old\r\nfriends who had followed him in victory or defeat; these\r\nrecollections must have been much in his mind during this year of\r\nafterglow. The end was fitting in its swiftness and dignity. No\r\nlingering, painful illness, but a swift stroke and a happy release.\r\n\"Nothing is here for tears; nothing to wail.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End",
