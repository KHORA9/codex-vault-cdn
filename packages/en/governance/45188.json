I was prompted to do so by the desire to\r\ncontribute my humble part in the realization of world peace. China, a\r\ncountry possessing a territory of 4,289,000 square miles, a population\r\nof 400,000,000 people, and the richest mineral and agricultural\r\nresources in the world, is now a prey of militaristic and capitalistic\r\npowers--a greater bone of contention than the Balkan Peninsula. Unless\r\nthe Chinese question can be settled peacefully, another world war\r\ngreater and more terrible than the one just past will be inevitable.\r\nIn order to solve the Chinese question, I suggest that the vast\r\nresources of China be developed internationally under a socialistic\r\nscheme, for the good of the world in general and the Chinese people in\r\nparticular. It is my hope that as a result of this, the present spheres\r\nof influence can be abolished; the international commercial war can be\r\ndone away with; the internecine capitalistic competition can be got rid\r\nof, and last, but not least, the class struggle between capital and\r\nlabor can be avoided. Thus the root of war will be forever exterminated\r\nso far as China is concerned.\r\n\r\nEach part of the different programs in this International Scheme, is\r\nbut a rough sketch or a general policy produced from a layman's thought\r\nwith very limited materials at his disposal. So alterations and changes\r\nwill have to be made after scientific investigation and detailed\r\nsurvey. For instance, in regard to the projected Great Northern Port,\r\nwhich is to be situated between the mouths of the Tsingho and the\r\nLwanho, the writer thought that the entrance of the harbor should be\r\nat the eastern side of the port but from actual survey by technical\r\nengineers, it is found that the entrance of the harbor should be at the\r\nwestern side of the port instead. So I crave great indulgence on the\r\npart of experts and specialists.\r\n\r\nI wish to thank Dr. Monlin Chiang, Mr. David Yui, Dr. Y. Y. Tsu, Mr.\r\nT. Z. Koo, and Dr. John Y. Lee, who have given me great assistance in\r\nreading over the manuscripts with me.\r\n\r\n            SUN YAT-SEN.\r\n\r\nCANTON, April 25, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                PAGE\r\n    THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA         1\r\n\r\n    PROGRAM I                                     11\r\n\r\n    PROGRAM II                                    30\r\n\r\n    PROGRAM III                                   77\r\n\r\n    PROGRAM IV                                   129\r\n\r\n    PROGRAM V                                    197\r\n\r\n    PROGRAM VI                                   222\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION                                   231\r\n\r\n    APPENDIX I                                   239\r\n\r\n    APPENDIX II                                  251\r\n\r\n    APPENDIX III                                 257\r\n\r\n    APPENDIX IV                                  259\r\n\r\n    APPENDIX V                                   260\r\n\r\n    APPENDIX VI                                  262\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              FACING\r\n                                                PAGE\r\n    FIGURE 1                                      16\r\n\r\n    FIGURE 2                                      17\r\n\r\n    MAP I                                         18\r\n\r\n    MAP II                                        19\r\n\r\n    MAP III                                       32\r\n\r\n    MAP IV                                        33\r\n\r\n    MAP V                                         44\r\n\r\n    MAP VI                                        45\r\n\r\n    MAP VII                                       48\r\n\r\n    MAP VIII                                      49\r\n\r\n    MAP IX                                        54\r\n\r\n    MAP X                                         55\r\n\r\n    MAP XI                                        82\r\n\r\n    MAP XII                                       83\r\n\r\n    MAP XIII                                      86\r\n\r\n    MAP XIV                                       87\r\n\r\n    MAP XV                                        90\r\n\r\n    MAP XVI                                       91\r\n\r\n    MAP AT END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe International Development of China\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA\r\n\r\nA PROJECT TO ASSIST THE READJUSTMENT OF POST-BELLUM INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that during the last year of the World War the daily\r\nexpenses of the various fighting nations amounted to two hundred\r\nand forty millions of dollars gold. It is accepted by even the most\r\nconservative, that only one half of this sum was spent on munitions and\r\nother direct war supplies, that is, one hundred and twenty millions\r\nof dollars gold. Let us consider these war supplies from a commercial\r\npoint of view. The battlefield is the market for these new industries,\r\nthe consumers of which are the soldiers. Various industries had to\r\nbe enlisted and many new ones created for the supplies. In order to\r\nincrease the production of these war commodities day by day, people\r\nof the warring countries and even those of the neutral states had to\r\nbe content with the barest necessities of life and had to give up all\r\nformer comforts and luxuries.\r\n\r\nNow the war is ended and the sole market of these war supplies has\r\nclosed, let us hope, forever, for the good of humanity. So, from now\r\non we are concerned with the problem as to how a readjustment may be\r\nbrought about. What must be considered first is the reconstruction of\r\nthe various countries, and next the supply of comforts and luxuries\r\nthat will have to be resumed. We remember that one hundred and twenty\r\nmillion dollars were spent every day on direct war supplies. Let us\r\nthen suppose that the two items mentioned will take up one half of this\r\nsum, that is, sixty millions of dollars a day which will still leave us\r\na balance of sixty million dollars a day. Besides, the many millions\r\nof soldiers who were once consumers will from now on become producers\r\nagain. Furthermore, the unification and nationalization of all the\r\nindustries, which I might call the Second Industrial Revolution, will\r\nbe more far-reaching than that of the first one in which Manual Labor\r\nwas displaced by Machinery. This second industrial revolution will\r\nincrease the productive power of man many times more than the first\r\none. Consequently, this unification and nationalization of industries\r\non account of the World War will further complicate the readjustment of\r\nthe post-war industries. Just imagine sixty million dollars a day or\r\ntwenty-one billions and nine hundred millions of dollars a year of new\r\ntrade created by the war suddenly have to stop when peace is concluded!\r\nWhere in this world can Europe and America look for a market to consume\r\nthis enormous saving from the war?\r\n\r\nIf the billions of dollars worth of war industries can find no place\r\nin the post-bellum readjustment, then they will be a pure economic\r\nwaste. The result will not only disturb the economic condition of the\r\nproducing countries, but will also be a great loss to the world at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nAll the commercial nations are looking to China as the only \"dumping\r\nground\" for their over-production. The pre-war condition of trade was\r\nunfavorable to China. The balance of imports over exports was something\r\nover one hundred million dollars gold annually. The market of China\r\nunder this condition could not expand much for soon after there will\r\nbe no more money or commodities left for exchanging goods with foreign\r\ncountries. Fortunately, the natural resources of China are great and\r\ntheir proper development would create an unlimited market for the whole\r\nworld and would utilize the greater part, if not all of the billions of\r\ndollars worth of war industries soon to be turned into peace industries.\r\n\r\nChina is the land that still employs manual labor for production and\r\nhas not yet entered the first stage of industrial evolution, while in\r\nEurope and America the second stage is already reached. So China has\r\nto begin the two stages of industrial evolution at once by adopting\r\nthe machinery as well as the nationalization of production. In this\r\ncase China will require machinery for her vast agriculture, machinery\r\nfor her rich mines, machinery for the building of her innumerable\r\nfactories, machinery for her extensive transportation systems and\r\nmachinery for all her public utilities. Let us see how this new demand\r\nfor machinery will help in the readjustment of war industries. The\r\nworkshops that turn out cannon can easily be made to turn out steam\r\nrollers for the construction of roads in China. The workshops that turn\r\nout tanks can be made to turn out trucks for the transportation of the\r\nraw materials that are lying everywhere in China. And all sorts of\r\nwarring machinery can be converted into peaceful tools for the general\r\ndevelopment of China's latent wealth. The Chinese people will welcome\r\nthe development of our country's resources provided that it can be kept\r\nout of Mandarin corruption and ensure the mutual benefit of China and\r\nof the countries coöperating with us.\r\n\r\nIt might be feared by some people in Europe and America that the\r\ndevelopment of China by war machinery, war organization and technical\r\nexperts might create unfavorable competition to foreign industries. I,\r\ntherefore, propose a scheme to develop a new market in China big enough\r\nboth for her own products and for products from foreign countries. The\r\nscheme will be along the following lines:\r\n\r\n     I. The Development of a Communications System.\r\n\r\n        (a) 100,000 miles of Railways.\r\n\r\n        (b) 1,000,000 miles of Macadam Roads.\r\n\r\n        (c) Improvement of Existing Canals.\r\n\r\n            (1) Hangchow-Tientsin Canals.\r\n\r\n            (2) Sikiang-Yangtze Canals.\r\n\r\n        (d) Construction of New Canals.\r\n\r\n            (1) Liaoho-Sunghwakiang Canal.\r\n\r\n            (2) Others to be projected.\r\n\r\n        (e) River Conservancy.\r\n\r\n            (1) To regulate the Embankments and Channel of the Yangtze\r\n                River from Hankow to the Sea thus facilitating\r\n                Ocean-going Ships to reach that port at all seasons.\r\n\r\n            (2) To regulate the Hoangho Embankments and Channel to\r\n                prevent floods.\r\n\r\n            (3) To regulate the Sikiang.\r\n\r\n            (4) To regulate the Hwaiho.\r\n\r\n            (5) To regulate various other rivers.\r\n\r\n        (f) The Construction of more Telegraph Lines and Telephone and\r\n            Wireless Systems all over the Country.\r\n\r\n    II. The Development of Commercial Harbors.\r\n\r\n        (a) Three largest Ocean Ports with future capacity equalling\r\n            New York Harbor to be constructed in North, Central and\r\n            South China.\r\n\r\n        (b) Various small Commercial and Fishing Harbors to be\r\n            constructed along the Coast.\r\n\r\n        (c) Commercial Docks to be constructed along all navigable\r\n            rivers.\r\n\r\n   III. Modern Cities with public utilities to be constructed in all\r\n        Railway Centers, Termini and alongside Harbors.\r\n\r\n    IV. Water Power Development.\r\n\r\n     V. Iron and Steel Works and Cement Works on the largest scale in\r\n        order to supply the above needs.\r\n\r\n    VI. Mineral Development.\r\n\r\n   VII. Agricultural Development.\r\n\r\n  VIII. Irrigational Work on the largest scale in Mongolia and\r\n        Sinkiang.\r\n\r\n    IX. Reforestation in Central and North China.\r\n\r\n     X. Colonization in Manchuria, Mongolia, Sinkiang, Kokonor, and\r\n        Thibaut.\r\n\r\nIf the above program could be carried out gradually, China will not\r\nonly be the \"Dumping Ground\" for foreign goods but actually will be\r\nthe \"Economic Ocean\" capable of absorbing all the surplus capital as\r\nquickly as the Industrial Nations can possibly produce by the coming\r\nIndustrial Revolution of Nationalized Productive Machinery. Then there\r\nwill be no more competition and commercial struggles in China as well\r\nas in the world.\r\n\r\nThe recent World War has proved to Mankind that war is ruinous to both\r\nthe Conqueror and the Conquered, and worse for the Aggressor. What is\r\ntrue in military warfare is more so in trade warfare. Since President\r\nWilson has proposed a League of Nations to end military war in the\r\nfuture, I desire to propose to end the trade war by coöperation and\r\nmutual help in the Development of China. This will root out probably\r\nthe greatest cause of future wars.\r\n\r\nThe world has been greatly benefited by the development of America as\r\nan industrial and a commercial Nation. So a developed China with her\r\nfour hundred millions of population, will be another New World in the\r\neconomic sense. The nations which will take part in this development\r\nwill reap immense advantages. Furthermore, international coöperation\r\nof this kind cannot but help to strengthen the Brotherhood of Man.\r\nUltimately, I am sure, this will culminate to be the keystone in the\r\narch of the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out this project successfully I suggest that three\r\nnecessary steps must be taken: First, that the various Governments of\r\nthe Capital-supplying Powers must agree to joint action and a unified\r\npolicy to form an International Organization with their war work\r\norganizers, administrators and experts of various lines to formulate\r\nplans and to standardize materials in order to prevent waste and to\r\nfacilitate work. Second, the confidence of the Chinese people must be\r\nsecured in order to gain their coöperation and enthusiastic support.\r\nIf the above two steps are accomplished, then the third step is to\r\nopen formal negotiation for the final contract of the project with the\r\nChinese Government. For which I suggest that it be on the same basis\r\nas the contract I once concluded with the Pauling Company of London,\r\nfor the construction of the Canton-Chungking Railway, since it was\r\nthe fairest to both parties and the one most welcomed by the Chinese\r\npeople, of all contracts that were ever made between China and the\r\nforeign countries.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, a warning must be given that mistakes such as\r\nthe notorious Sheng Shun Hwai's nationalized Railway Scheme in 1911\r\nmust not be committed again. In those days foreign bankers entirely\r\ndisregarded the will of the Chinese people, and thought that they\r\ncould do everything with the Chinese Government alone. But to their\r\nregret, they found that the contracts which they had concluded with the\r\nGovernment, by heavy bribery, were only to be blocked by the people\r\nlater on. Had the foreign bankers gone in the right way of first\r\nsecuring the confidence of the Chinese people, and then approaching the\r\nGovernment for a contract, many things might have been accomplished\r\nwithout a hitch. Therefore, in this International Project we must pay\r\nmore attention to the people's will than ever before.\r\n\r\nIf my proposition is acceptable to the Capital-supplying Powers, I will\r\nfurnish further details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe industrial development of China should be carried out along two\r\nlines: (1) by private enterprise and (2) by national undertaking. All\r\nmatters that can be and are better carried out by private enterprise\r\nshould be left to private hands which should be encouraged and fully\r\nprotected by liberal laws. And in order to facilitate the industrial\r\ndevelopment by private enterprise in China, the hitherto suicidal\r\ninternal taxes must be abolished, the cumbersome currency must be\r\nreformed, the various kinds of official obstacles must be removed, and\r\ntransportation facilities must be provided. All matters that cannot\r\nbe taken up by private concerns and those that possess monopolistic\r\ncharacter should be taken up as national undertakings. It is for\r\nthis latter line of development that we are here endeavoring to\r\ndeal with. In this national undertaking, foreign capital have to be\r\ninvited, foreign experts and organizers have to be enlisted, and\r\ngigantic methods have to be adopted. The property thus created will be\r\nstate owned and will be managed for the benefit of the whole nation.\r\nDuring the construction and the operation of each of these national\r\nundertakings, before its capital and interest are fully repaid, it\r\nwill be managed and supervised by foreign experts under Chinese\r\nemployment. As one of their obligations, these foreign experts have\r\nto undertake the training of Chinese assistants to take their places\r\nin the future. When the capital and interest of each undertaking are\r\npaid off, the Chinese Government will have the option to employ either\r\nforeigners or Chinese to manage the concern as it thinks fit.\r\n\r\nBefore entering into the details of this International development\r\nscheme, four principles have to be considered:\r\n\r\n    (1) The most remunerative field must be selected in order to\r\n        attract foreign capital.\r\n\r\n    (2) The most urgent needs of the nation must be met.\r\n\r\n    (3) The lines of least resistance must be followed.\r\n\r\n    (4) The most suitable positions must be chosen.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the above principles, I formulate PROGRAM I as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      I. The construction of a great Northern Port on the Gulf of\r\n         Pechili.\r\n\r\n     II. The building of a system of railways from the Great\r\n         Northern Port to the Northwestern extremity of China.\r\n\r\n    III. The Colonization of Mongolia and Sinkiang (Chinese\r\n         Turkestan).\r\n\r\n     IV. The construction of canals to connect the inland waterway\r\n         systems of North and Central China with the Great Northern\r\n         Port.\r\n\r\n      V. The development of the Iron and Coal fields in Shansi and\r\n         the construction of an Iron and Steel Works.\r\n\r\nThese five projects will be worked out as one program, for each of them\r\nwill assist and accelerate the development of the others. The Great\r\nNorthern Port will serve as a base of operation of this International\r\nDevelopment Scheme, as well as a connecting link of transportation\r\nand communication between China and the outer world. The other four\r\nprojects will be centered around it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nThe Great Northern Port\r\n\r\nI propose that a great deep water and ice free port be constructed on\r\nthe Gulf of Pechili. The need of such a port in that part of China has\r\nbeen keenly felt for a long time. Several projects have been proposed\r\nsuch as the deepening of the Taku Bar, the construction of a harbor\r\nin the Chiho estuary, the Chinwangtao Harbor which has actually been\r\ncarried out on a small scale and the Hulutao Harbor which is on the\r\npoint of being constructed. But the site of my projected port is in\r\nnone of these places for the first two are too far from the deep water\r\nline and too near to fresh water which freezes in winter. So it is\r\nimpossible to make them into deep water and ice free ports, while\r\nthe last two are too far away from the center of population and are\r\nunprofitable as commercial ports. The locality of my projected port is\r\njust at midway between Taku and Chinwangtao and at a point between the\r\nmouths of the Tsingho and Lwanho, on the cape of the coast line between\r\nTaku and Chinwangtao. This is one of the points nearest to deep water\r\nin this Gulf. With the fresh water of the Tsingho and Lwanho diverted\r\naway, it can be made a deep water and ice free port without much\r\ndifficulty. Its distance to Tientsin is about seventy or eighty miles\r\nless than that of Chinwangtao to Tientsin. Moreover, this port can be\r\nconnected with the inland waterway systems of North and Central China\r\nby canal, whereas in the case of Chinwangtao and Hulutao this could\r\nnot be done. So this port is far superior as a commercial harbor than\r\nHulutao or Chinwangtao which at present is the only ice free port in\r\nthe Gulf of Pechili.\r\n\r\nFrom a commercial standpoint this port will be a paying proposition\r\nfrom the very beginning of its construction, owing to the fact\r\nthat it is situated at the center of the greatest salt industry in\r\nChina. The cheapest salt is produced here by sun evaporation only.\r\nIf modern methods could be added, also utilizing the cheap coal near\r\nby, the production could increase many times more and the cost could\r\nthus be made cheaper. Then it can supply the whole of China with\r\nmuch cheaper salt. By this industry alone it is quite sufficient to\r\nsupport a moderate sized harbor which must be the first step of this\r\ngreat project. Besides, there is in the immediate neighborhood the\r\ngreatest coal mine that has yet been developed in China, the Kailan\r\nMining Company. The output of its colliery is about four million tons\r\na year. At present the company uses its own harbor, Chinwangtao,\r\nfor shipping its exports. But our projected port is much nearer to\r\nits colliery than Chinwangtao. It can be connected with the mine by\r\ncanal thus providing it with a much cheaper carriage than by rail to\r\nChinwangtao. Furthermore, our projected port will in future consume\r\nmuch of the Kailan coal. Thus eventually the Company must use our port\r\nas a shipping stage for its exports. Tientsin, the largest commercial\r\ncenter in North China, has no deep harbor and is ice bound several\r\nmonths a year in winter, and so has to use our projected port entirely\r\nas an outlet for its world trade. This is the local need only but for\r\nthis alone it is quite sufficient to make our projected port a paying\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nBut my idea is to develop this port as large as New York in a\r\nreasonable limit of time. Now, let us survey the hinterland to see\r\nwhether the possibility justifies my ideal or not. To the southwest\r\nare the provinces of Chili and Shansi, and the Hoangho valley with\r\na population of nearly a hundred millions. To the northwest are the\r\nundeveloped Jehol district and the vast Mongolian Prairie with their\r\nvirgin soil waiting for development, Chili with its dense population\r\nand Shansi with its rich mineral resources have to depend upon this\r\nport as their only outlet to the sea. And if the future Dolon Nor and\r\nUrga Railway is completed with connection to the Siberian line then\r\nCentral Siberia will also have to use this as its nearest seaport. Thus\r\nits contributing or rather distributing area will be larger than that\r\nof New York. Finally, this port will become the true terminus of the\r\nfuture Eurasian Railway System, which will connect the two continents.\r\nThe land which we select to be the site of our projected port is now\r\nalmost worth next to nothing. Let us say two or three hundred square\r\nmiles be taken up as national property absolutely for our future city\r\nbuilding. If within forty years we could develop a city as large\r\nas Philadelphia, not to say New York, the land value alone will be\r\nsufficient to pay off the capital invested in its development.\r\n\r\nThe need of such a port in this part of China goes without saying.\r\nFor the provinces of Chili, Shansi, Western Shantung, Northern Honan,\r\na part of Fengtien and the greater part of Shensi and Kansu with a\r\npopulation of about 100 millions are lacking of a seaport of this kind.\r\nMongolia and Sinkiang as well as the rich coal and iron fields of\r\nShansi will also have to depend on the Chili coast as their only outlet\r\nto the sea. And the millions of congested population of the coast and\r\nthe Yangtze valley need an entrance to the virgin soil of the Mongolian\r\nPrairie and the Tienshan Valley. The port will be the shortest doorway\r\nand the cheapest passage to these regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1]\r\n\r\nThe locality of our projected port is nearest to deep water line,\r\nand far away from any large river which might carry silt to fill up\r\nthe approach of the harbor like those of the Hoangho entrance and the\r\nYangtze estuary which cause great trouble to conservancy work. So it\r\nhas no great natural obstacle to be overcome. Moreover, it is situated\r\nin an arid plain with few people living on it, so it has no artificial\r\nhindrance to be overcome. We can do whatever we please in the process\r\nof construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2]\r\n\r\nAs regards the planning and estimation of the work of the harbor\r\nconstruction and city building, I must leave them to experts who have\r\nto make extensive surveys and soundings before detailed plan and proper\r\nestimation could be made. Whereas for rough reference see Map I, and\r\nfigures 1 and 2.[A]\r\n\r\n      [A] As soon as this first program reached the American\r\n          Legation in Peking, the former Minister, Dr. Paul S.\r\n          Reinsch, immediately sent an expert to survey the site\r\n          which the writer indicated, and found that it is really\r\n          the best site on the Chili Coast for a world harbor,\r\n          excepting that the entrance of the port should be at\r\n          the west side instead of the east side as the writer\r\n          proposed. Detailed plans have been made as figures 1\r\n          and 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nThe Northwestern Railway System\r\n\r\nOur projected Railway will start at the Great Northern Port and follow\r\nthe Lwan Valley to the prairie city of Dolon Nor, a distance of three\r\nhundred miles. This railway should be built in double tracks at the\r\ncommencement. As our projected Port is a starting point to the sea, so\r\nDolon Nor is a gate to the vast prairie which our projected Railway\r\nSystem is going to tap. It is from Dolon Nor our Northwestern Railway\r\nSystem is going to radiate. First, a line N. N. E. will run parallel\r\nto the Khingan Range to Khailar, and thence to Moho, the gold district\r\non the right bank of the Amur River. This line is about eight hundred\r\nmiles in length. Second, a line N. N. W. to Kurelun, and thence to the\r\nfrontier to join the Siberian line near Chita. This line has a distance\r\nof about six hundred miles. Third, a trunk line northwest, west, and\r\nsouthwest, skirting off the northern edge of the desert proper, to\r\nUrumochi at the western end of China, a distance of about one thousand\r\nsix hundred miles all on level land. Fourth, a line from Urumochi\r\nwestward to Ili, a distance of about four hundred miles. Fifth, a line\r\nfrom Urumochi southeast across the Tienshan gap into the Darim basin,\r\nthen turning southwest running along the fertile zone between the\r\nsouthern watershed of the Tienshan and the northern edge of the Darim\r\nDesert, to Kashgar, and thence turning southeast to another fertile\r\nzone between the eastern watershed of the Pamir, the northern watershed\r\nof the Kuenlum Mountain and the southern edge of the Darim Desert, to\r\nthe city of Iden or Keria, a distance of about one thousand two hundred\r\nmiles all on level land. Sixth, a branch from the Dolon Nor Urumochi\r\nTrunk Line, which I shall call Junction A, to Urga and thence to the\r\nfrontier city Kiakata, a distance of about three hundred and fifty\r\nmiles. Seventh, a branch from Junction B to Uliassutai and beyond N. N.\r\nW. up to the frontier, a distance of about six hundred miles. And\r\neighth, a branch from Junction C northwest to the frontier, a distance\r\nof about four hundred and fifty miles. See Map II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP I]\r\n\r\nRegarded from the principle of \"following the line of least resistance\"\r\nour projected railways in this program is the most ideal one. For\r\nmost of the seven thousand miles of lines under this project are on\r\nperfectly level land. For instance, the Trunk Line from Dolon Nor to\r\nKashgar and beyond, about a distance of three thousand miles right\r\nalong is on the most fertile plain and encounters no natural obstacles,\r\nneither high mountains nor great rivers.\r\n\r\nRegarded from the principle of \"the most suitable position,\" our\r\nprojected railways will command the most dominating position of world\r\nimportance. It will form a part of the trunk line of the Eurasian\r\nsystem which will connect the two populous centers, Europe and China,\r\ntogether. It will be the shortest line from the Pacific Coast to\r\nEurope. Its branch from Ili will connect with the future Indo-European\r\nline, and through Bagdad, Damascus and Cairo, will link up also with\r\nthe future African system. Then there will be a through route from our\r\nprojected port to Capetown. There is no existing railway commanding\r\nsuch a world important position as this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP II]\r\n\r\nRegarded from the principle of the \"most urgent need of the Nation,\"\r\nthis railway system becomes the first in importance, for the\r\nterritories traversed by it are larger than the eighteen provinces\r\nof China Proper. Owing to the lack of means of transportation and\r\ncommunication at present these rich territories are left undeveloped\r\nand millions of laborers in the congested provinces along the Coast\r\nand in the Yangtze Valley are without work. What a great waste of\r\nnatural and human energies. If there is a railway connecting these vast\r\nterritories, the waste labor of the congested provinces can go and\r\ndevelop these rich soils for the good not only of China but also of the\r\nwhole commercial world. So a system of railways to the northwestern\r\npart of the country is the most urgent need both politically and\r\neconomically for China to-day.\r\n\r\nI have intentionally left out the first principle--\"the most\r\nremunerative field must be selected\"--not because I want to neglect\r\nit but because I mean to call more attention to it and treat it more\r\nfully. It is commonly known to financiers and railway men that a\r\nrailway in a densely populated country from end to end is the best\r\npaying proposition, and a railway in a thinly settled country from end\r\nto end is the least paying one. And a railway in an almost unpopulated\r\ncountry like our projected lines will take a long time to make it a\r\npaying business. That is why the United States Government had to grant\r\nlarge tracts of public lands to railway corporations to induce them to\r\nbuild the Transcontinental lines to the Pacific Coast, half a century\r\nago. Whenever I talked with foreign railway men and financiers about\r\nthe construction of railways to Mongolia and Sinkiang, they generally\r\ngot very shy of the proposition. Undoubtedly they thought that it\r\nis for political and military reasons only that such a line as the\r\nSiberian Railway was built, which traversed through a thinly populated\r\nland. But they could not grasp the fact which might be entirely new\r\nto them, that a railway between a densely populated country and a\r\nsparsely settled country will pay far better than one that runs\r\nfrom end to end in a densely populated land. The reason is that in\r\neconomic conditions the two ends of a well populated country are not\r\nso different as that between a thickly populated country and a newly\r\nopened country. At the two ends of a well populated country, in many\r\nrespects, the local people are self-supplying, excepting a few special\r\narticles which they depend upon the other end of the road to supply.\r\nSo the demand and supply between the two places are not very great,\r\nthus the trade between the two ends of the railway could not be very\r\nlucrative. While the difference of the economic condition between a\r\nwell populated country and an unpopulated country is very great. The\r\nworkers of the new land have to depend upon the supplies of the thickly\r\npopulated country almost in everything excepting foodstuffs and raw\r\nmaterials which they have in abundance and for disposal of which they\r\nhave to depend upon the demand of the well populated district. Thus the\r\ntrade between the two ends of the line will be extraordinarily great.\r\nFurthermore, a railway in a thickly populated place will not affect\r\nmuch the masses which consist of the majority of the population. It\r\nis only the few well-to-do and the merchants and tradesmen that make\r\nuse of it. While with a railway between a thickly populated country\r\nand a sparsely settled or unsettled country, as soon as it is opened\r\nto traffic for each mile, the masses of the congested country will use\r\nit and rush into the new land in a wholesale manner. Thus the railway\r\nwill be employed to its utmost capacity in passenger traffic from the\r\nbeginning. The comparison between the Peking-Hankow Railway and the\r\nPeking-Mukden Railway in China is a convincing proof.\r\n\r\nThe Peking-Hankow Railway is a line of over eight hundred miles running\r\nfrom the capital of the country to the commercial center in the heart\r\nof China right along in an extraordinarily densely settled country\r\nfrom end to end. While the Peking-Mukden line is barely six hundred\r\nmiles in length running from a thickly populated country to thinly\r\npopulated Manchuria. The former is a well paying line but the latter\r\npays far better. The net profit of the shorter Peking-Mukden Line is\r\nsometimes three to four millions more yearly than that of the longer\r\nPeking-Hankow line.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is logically clear that a railway in a thickly populated\r\ncountry is much better than one that is in a thinly populated country\r\nin remuneration. But a railway between a very thickly populated and\r\na very thinly populated or unpopulated country is the best paying\r\nproposition. This is a law in Railway Economics which hitherto had not\r\nbeen discovered by railway men and financiers.\r\n\r\nAccording to this new railway economic law, our projected railway\r\nwill be the best remunerative project of its kind. For at the one\r\nend, we have our projected port which acts as a connecting link with\r\nthe thickly populated coast of China and the Yangtze Valley and also\r\nthe two existing lines, the Kingham and the Tsinpu, as feeders to the\r\nprojected port and the Dolon Nor line. And at the other end, we have\r\na vast and rich territory, larger than China Proper, to be developed.\r\nThere is no such vast fertile field so near to a center of a population\r\nof four hundred millions to be found in any other part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nThe Colonization of Mongolia and Sinkiang\r\n\r\nThe Colonization of Mongolia and Sinkiang is a complement of the\r\nRailway scheme. Each is dependent upon the other for its prosperity.\r\nThe colonization scheme, besides benefitting the railway, is in itself\r\na greatly profitable undertaking. The results of the United States,\r\nCanada, Australia, and Argentina are ample proofs of this. In the\r\ncase of our project, it is simply a matter of applying waste Chinese\r\nlabor and foreign machinery to a fertile land for production for which\r\nits remuneration is sure. The present Colonization of Manchuria,\r\nnotwithstanding its topsy turvy way which caused great waste of land\r\nand human energy, has been wonderfully prosperous. If we would adopt\r\nscientific methods in our colonization project we could certainly\r\nobtain better results than all the others. Therefore, I propose\r\nthat the whole movement be directed in a systematic way by state\r\norganization with the help of foreign experts and war organizers, for\r\nthe good of the colonists particularly and the nation generally.\r\n\r\nThe land should be bought up by the state in order to prevent the\r\nspeculators from creating the dog-in-the-manger system, to the\r\ndetriment of the public. The land should be prepared and divided into\r\nfarmsteads, then leased to colonists on perpetual term. The initial\r\ncapital, seeds, implements and houses should be furnished by the state\r\nat cost price on cash or on the instalment plan. For these services,\r\nbig organizations should be formed and war work measures should be\r\nadopted in order to transport, to feed, to clothe and to house every\r\ncolonist on credit in his first year.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a sufficient number of colonists is settled in a district,\r\nfranchise should be given for self-government and the colonists should\r\nbe trained to manage their own local affairs with perfect democratic\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nIf within ten years we can transport, let us say, ten millions of the\r\npeople, from the congested provinces of China, to the Northwestern\r\nterritory to develop its natural resources, the benefit to the\r\ncommercial world at large will be enormous. No matter how big a capital\r\nthat shall have been invested in the project it could be repaid within\r\na very short time. So in regard to its bearing to \"the principle of\r\nremuneration\" there is no question about it.\r\n\r\nRegarded from \"the principle of the need of the Nation\" colonization\r\nis the most urgent need of the first magnitude. At present China\r\nhas more than a million soldiers to be disbanded. Besides, the dense\r\npopulation will need elbow room to move in. This Colonization project\r\nis the best thing for both purposes. The soldiers have to be disbanded\r\nat great expense and hundreds of millions of dollars may be needed\r\nfor disbandment alone, in paying them off with a few months' pay. If\r\nnothing more could be done for these soldiers' welfare, they will\r\neither be left to starve or to rob for a living. Then the consequences\r\nwill be unimaginable. This calamity must be prevented and prevented\r\neffectively. The best way for this is the colonization scheme. I hope\r\nthat the friendly foreign financiers, who have the welfare of China at\r\nheart, when requested to float a reorganization loan for the Chinese\r\nGovernment in the future, will persist on the point--that the money\r\nfurnished must first be used to carry out the colonization scheme for\r\nthe disbanded soldiers. Otherwise, their money will only work disasters\r\nto China.\r\n\r\nFor the million or more of the soldiers to be disbanded, the district\r\nbetween our projected port and Dolon Nor is quite enough to accommodate\r\nthem. This district is quite rich in mineral resources and is very\r\nsparsely settled. If a railway is to start at once from the projected\r\nport to Dolon Nor these soldiers could be utilized as a pioneer party\r\nfor the work of the port, of the railway, of the developing of the\r\nadjacent land beyond the Great Wall, and of preparing Dolon Nor as\r\na jumping ground for further colonization development of the great\r\nnorthern plain.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nThe Construction of Canals to connect the Inland Waterway Systems of\r\nNorth and Central China with the Great Northern Port\r\n\r\nThis scheme will include the regulation of the Hoangho and its\r\nbranches, the Weiho in Shensi, and the Fenho in Shansi and connecting\r\ncanals. The Hoangho should be deepened at its mouth in order to give a\r\ngood drawing to clear its bed of silt and carry the same to the sea.\r\nFor this purpose, jetties should be built far out to the deep sea, as\r\nthose at the mouths of the Mississippi in America. Its embankments\r\nshould be parallel in order to make the width of the channel equal\r\nright along, so as to give equal velocity to the current which will\r\nprevent the deposit of silt at the bottom. By dams and locks, it could\r\nbe made navigable right up to Lanchow, in the province of Kansu, and at\r\nthe same time water power could be developed. The Weiho and the Fenho\r\ncan also be treated in the same manner so as to make them navigable\r\nto a great extent in the provinces of Shensi and Shansi. Thus the\r\nprovinces of Kansu, Shensi, and Shansi can be connected by waterway\r\nwith our projected port on the Gulf of Pechili, so that cheap carriage\r\ncan be provided for the rich mineral and other products from these\r\nthree hitherto secluded provinces.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of regulating the Hoangho may be very great. As a paying\r\nproject, it may not be very attractive but as a flood preventive\r\nmeasure, it is the most important task to the whole nation. This river\r\nhas been known as \"China's Sorrow\" for thousands of years. By its\r\noccasional overflow and bursting of its embankments, millions of lives\r\nand billions of money have been destroyed. It is a constant source of\r\nanxiety in the minds of all China's statesmen from time immemorial.\r\nA permanent safeguard must be effected, once for all, despite the\r\nexpenses that will be incurred. The whole nation must bear the burden\r\nof its expenses. To deepen its mouth, to regulate its embankments and\r\nto build extra dykes are only half of the work to prevent flood. The\r\nentire reforestation of its watershed to prevent the washing off of\r\nloess is another half of the work in the prevention of flood.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canal, the former Great Waterway of China between the North\r\nand the South for centuries, and now being reconstructed in certain\r\nsections, should be wholly reconstructed from end to end, in order to\r\nrestore the inland waterway traffic from the Yangtze Valley to the\r\nNorth. The reconstruction of this canal will be a great remunerative\r\nconcern for it runs right along from Tientsin to Hangchow in an\r\nextremely rich and populous country.\r\n\r\nAnother new canal should be constructed from our projected port to\r\nTientsin to link up all the inland waterway systems to the new port.\r\nThis new canal should be built extra wide and deep, let us say, similar\r\nto the present size of the Peiho, for the use of the coasting and\r\nshallow-draft vessels which the Peiho now accommodates for other than\r\nthe winter seasons. The banks of this canal should be prepared for\r\nfactory sites so as to enable it to pay not only by its traffic but\r\nalso from the land on both sides of its banks.\r\n\r\nAs for planning and estimating these river and canal works, the\r\nassistance of technical experts must be solicited.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nThe Development of the Iron and Coal Fields in Chili and Shansi, and\r\nthe Construction of Iron and Steel Works\r\n\r\nSince we have in hand in this program the work of the construction\r\nof the Great Northern Port, the work of the building of a system of\r\nrailways from the Great Northern Port to the North Western Extremity\r\nof China, the work of the Colonization of Mongolia and Sinkiang, and\r\nthe work of the construction of canals and improvement of rivers to\r\nconnect with the Great Northern Port, the demand for materials will be\r\nvery great. As the iron and coal resources of every industrial country\r\nare decreasing rapidly every year, and as all of them are contemplating\r\nthe conservation of their natural resources for the use of future\r\ngenerations, if all the materials for the great development of China\r\nwere to be drawn from them, the draining of the natural resources of\r\nthose countries will be detrimental for their future generations.\r\nBesides, the present need of the post-bellum reconstruction of Europe\r\nhas already absorbed all the iron and coal that the industrial world\r\ncould supply. Therefore, new resources must be opened up to meet the\r\nextraordinary demand of the development of China.\r\n\r\nThe unlimited iron and coal fields of Shansi and Chili should be\r\ndeveloped on a large scale. Let us say a capital of from five\r\nhundred to a thousand million dollars Mex. should be invested in\r\nthis project. For as soon as the general development of China is\r\nstarted we would have created a vast market for iron and steel which\r\nthe present industrial world will be unable to supply. Think of our\r\nrailway construction, city building, harbor works, and various kinds\r\nof machineries and implements that will be needed! In fact, the\r\ndevelopment of China means the creation of a new need of various kinds\r\nof goods, for which, we must undertake to create the supply also, by\r\nutilizing the raw materials near by. Thus a great iron and steel works\r\nis an urgent necessity as well as a greatly profitable project.\r\n\r\nIn this FIRST PROGRAM, we have followed the four principles set forth\r\nat the outset pretty closely. As needs create new needs and profits\r\npromote more profits, so our first program will be the forerunner of\r\nthe other great developments, which we will deal with shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM II\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Great Northern Port is the center of our first program, so the\r\nGreat Eastern Port will be the center of our second program. I shall\r\nformulate this program as follows:\r\n\r\n      I. The Great Eastern Port.\r\n\r\n     II. The regulating of the Yangtze Channel and embankments.\r\n\r\n    III. The Construction of River Ports.\r\n\r\n     IV. The Improvement of Existing Waterways and Canals in\r\n         connection with the Yangtze.\r\n\r\n      V. The Establishment of large Cement Works.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nThe Great Eastern Port\r\n\r\nAlthough Shanghai is already the largest port in all China, as it\r\nstands it will not meet the future needs and demands of a world harbor.\r\nTherefore there is a movement at present among the foreign merchants\r\nin China to construct a world port in Shanghai. Several plans have\r\nbeen proposed such as to improve the existing arrangement, to build a\r\nwet dock by closing the Whangpoo, to construct a closed harbor on the\r\nright bank of the Yangtze outside of Whangpoo, and to excavate a new\r\nbasin just east of Shanghai with a shipping canal to Hangchow Bay. It\r\nis estimated that a cost of over one hundred million dollars Mex. must\r\nbe spent before Shanghai can be made a first-class port.\r\n\r\nAccording to the four principles I set forth in Program I, Shanghai\r\nas a world port for Eastern China is not in an ideal position. The\r\nbest position for a port of that kind is at a point just south of\r\nChapu on the Hangchow Bay. This locality is far superior to Shanghai\r\nas an eastern port for China from the standpoint of our four\r\nprinciples as set forth in our first program. Henceforth, in our\r\ncourse of discussion, we shall call this the \"Projected Port\" so as to\r\ndistinguish it from Shanghai, the existing port of Eastern China.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Projected Port\r\n\r\nThe \"Projected Port\" will be on the Bay which lies between the Chapu\r\nand the Kanpu promontories, a distance of about fifteen miles. A new\r\nsea wall should be built from one promontory to the other and a gap\r\nshould be left at the Chapu end, a few hundred feet from the hill as\r\nan entrance to the harbor. The sea wall should be divided into five\r\nsections of three miles each. For the present, one section of three\r\nmiles in length and one and a half miles in width should be built and\r\na harbor of three or more square miles so formed would be sufficient.\r\nWith the growth of commerce one section after another could be added\r\nto meet the needs. The front sea wall should be built of stone or\r\nconcrete, while the transverse wall between the sea wall and the land\r\nside should be built of sand and bush mattress as a temporary structure\r\nto be removed in case of the extension of the harbor. Once a harbor\r\nis formed there need be no trouble regarding the future conservancy\r\nwork, for there is no silt-carrying water in the vicinity by which the\r\nharbor and its approaches may be silted up afterwards. The entrance of\r\nour harbor is in the deepest part of the Hangchow Bay, and from the\r\nentrance to the open sea there is an average depth of six to seven\r\nfathoms at low water. The largest ocean liner could therefore come into\r\nport at any hour. Thus as a first-class seaport in Central China our\r\nProjected Port is superior to Shanghai. See Map III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP III]\r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of the principle of the line of least resistance,\r\nour Projected Port will be on new land which will offer absolute\r\nfreedom for city planning and industrial development. All public\r\nutilities and transportation plants can be constructed according to the\r\nmost up-to-date methods. This point alone is an important factor for a\r\nfuture city like ours which in time is bound to grow as large as New\r\nYork City. If one hundred years ago human foresight could have foreseen\r\nthe present size and population of New York, much of the labor and\r\nmoney spent could have been saved and blunders due to shortsightedness\r\navoided in meeting conditions of the ever growing population and\r\ncommerce of that city. With this in view a great Eastern Port in China\r\nshould be started on new ground to insure room for growth proportionate\r\nto its needs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP IV]\r\n\r\nMoreover, all the natural advantages which Shanghai possesses as a\r\ncentral mart and Yangtze Port in Eastern China are also possessed by\r\nour Projected Port. Furthermore, our Projected Port in comparison\r\nwith Shanghai is of shorter distance, by rail communication, to all\r\nthe large cities south of the Yangtze. And if the existing waterway\r\nbetween this part of the country and Wuhu were improved then the water\r\ncommunication with the upper Yangtze would also be shorter from our\r\nProjected Port than from Shanghai. And all the artificial advantages\r\npossessed by Shanghai as a large city and a commercial center in this\r\npart of China can be easily attained by our Projected Port within a\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\nComparing Shanghai with our Projected Port from a remunerative point of\r\nview in our development scheme, the former is much inferior in position\r\nto the latter, for valuable lands have to be bought and costly plants\r\nand existing arrangements have to be scrapped the cost of which alone\r\nis enough to construct a fine harbor on our projected site. Therefore,\r\nit is highly advisable to construct another first-class port for\r\nEastern China like the one I here propose, leaving Shanghai to be an\r\ninland mart and manufacturing center as Manchester is in relation to\r\nLiverpool, Osaka to Kobe, and Tokyo to Yokohama.\r\n\r\nOur Projected Port will be a highly remunerative proposition for the\r\ncost of construction will be many times cheaper than Shanghai and the\r\nwork simpler. The land between Chapu and Kanpu and farther on will not\r\ncost more than fifty to one hundred dollars a mow. The State should\r\ntake up a few hundred square miles of land in this neighborhood for the\r\nscheme of our future city development. Let us say two hundred square\r\nmiles of land at the price of one hundred dollars a mow be taken up.\r\nAs six mows make an acre and six hundred and forty acres a square\r\nmile, two hundred square miles would cost 76,000,000 dollars Mex. An\r\nenormous sum for a project indeed! But the land could be fixed at the\r\npresent price and the State could buy only that part of land which will\r\nimmediately be taken up and used. The other part of the land would\r\nremain as State land unpaid for and left to the original owners' use\r\nwithout the right to sell. Thus the State only takes up as much land as\r\nit could use in the development scheme at a fixed price which remains\r\npermanent. The payment then would be gradual. The State could pay for\r\nthe land from its unearned increment afterwards. So that only the first\r\nallotment of land has to be paid for from the capital fund; the rest\r\nwill be paid for by its own future value. After the first section of\r\nthe harbor is completed and the port developed, the price of land then\r\nwould be bound to rise rapidly, and within ten years the land value\r\nwithin the city limits would rise to various grades from a thousand\r\nto a hundred thousand dollars per mow. Thus the land itself would be\r\na source of profit. Besides there would also be the profit from the\r\nscheme itself, i.e., the harbor and the city. Because of its commanding\r\nposition, the harbor has every possibility of becoming a city equal\r\nto New York. It would probably be the only deep-water seaport for the\r\nYangtze Valley and beyond, an area peopled by two hundred million\r\ninhabitants, twice the population of the whole United States. The rate\r\nof growth of such a city would be in proportion to the rate of progress\r\nof the working out of the development scheme. If war work methods, that\r\nis, gigantic planning and efficient organization, were applied to the\r\nconstruction of the harbor and city, then an Oriental New York City\r\nwould spring up in a very short time.\r\n\r\n\r\nShanghai as the Great Eastern Port\r\n\r\nIf only to provide a deep-water harbor for the future commerce in this\r\npart of China is our object then there is no question about the choice\r\nbetween Shanghai and our Projected Port. From every point of view\r\nShanghai is doomed. However, in our scheme of development of China,\r\nShanghai has certain claims for our consideration which may prove its\r\nsalvation as an important city. The curse of Shanghai as a world port\r\nfor future commerce is the silt of the Yangtze which fills up all its\r\napproaches rapidly every year. This silt, according to the estimation\r\nof Mr. Von Heidenstam, Engineer-in-chief of the Whangpoo Conservancy\r\nBoard, is a hundred million tons a year and is sufficient to cover an\r\narea of forty square miles ten feet deep. So before Shanghai can be\r\nconsidered ever likely to become a world port this silt problem must\r\nfirst be solved. Fortunately, in our program, we have the regulation of\r\nthe Yangtze Channels and Embankments, which will coöperate in solving\r\nthe problem of Shanghai. Thus with this scheme in mind we might just as\r\nwell consider that the silt question of Shanghai has been solved and\r\nlet us go ahead, while leaving the regulation of the Yangtze Estuary to\r\nthe next part, to deal with the improvement of the Shanghai Harbor.\r\n\r\nThere are many plans proposed by experts for improving the Shanghai\r\nHarbor as stated before, and some of them will necessitate the\r\nscrapping of all the work which has been done by the Whangpoo\r\nConservancy Board for the last twelve years, at the cost of eleven\r\nmillion taels. Here I wish to present a layman's plan for the\r\nconsideration of specialists and the public.\r\n\r\nMy project for the construction of a world harbor in Shanghai is to\r\nleave the existing arrangement intact from the mouth of the Whangpoo\r\nto the junction of Kao Chiao Creek above Gough Island. Thus all the\r\nwork hitherto done by the Whangpoo Conservancy Board for the last\r\ntwelve years will be saved. The plan is to cut a new canal from the\r\njunction of Kao Chiao Creek right into Pootung to prolong that part\r\nof the channel which has been completed by the Conservancy Work, and\r\nto enlarge the curve along the right side of the Whangpoo River and\r\njoin it again, at the second turn above Lunghwa Railway Junction, so\r\nas to make the river from that point to a point opposite Yangtzepoo\r\nPoint almost in a straight line and thence a gentle curve to Woosung.\r\nThis new canal would encircle nearly thirty square miles of land which\r\nwould form the civic center and the New Bund of our future Shanghai.\r\nOf course the present crooked Whangpoo right in front of Shanghai\r\nwould have to be filled up to form boulevards and business lots. It\r\ngoes without saying that the reclaimed lots from the Whangpoo would\r\nbecome State property and the land between this and the new river and\r\nbeyond should be taken up by the State and put at the disposal of\r\nthe International Development Organization. Thus it may be possible\r\nfor Shanghai to compete with our Projected Port economically in\r\nits construction and therefore to attract foreign capital, to the\r\nimprovement of Shanghai as a future world port. See Map IV.\r\n\r\nBelow Yangtzepoo Point I propose to build a wet dock. This dock should\r\nbe laid between the left bank of the present Whangpoo, from Yangtzepoo\r\nPoint to the turn above Gough Island and the left bank of the new\r\nriver. The space of the dock should be about six square miles. A lock\r\nentrance is to be constructed at the point above Gough Island. The wet\r\ndock should be forty feet deep and the new river can also be made the\r\nsame depth by flushing with the water, not as proposed by experts, from\r\na lock canal between the Yangtze and the Taihu, at Kiangyin, but from\r\nour improved waterway between this part of the country and Wuhu so\r\nthat a much stronger current could be obtained.\r\n\r\nAs we see that the present Whangpoo has to be reclaimed from the second\r\nturn above Lunghwa Railway Junction to Yangtzepoo Point for city\r\nplanning, then the question of how to dispose of the Soochow Creek must\r\nbe answered. I propose that this stream should be led alongside the\r\nright bank of the future defunct river and straight on to the upper end\r\nof the wet dock, thence joining the new canal. At the point of contact\r\nof the Creek and the wet dock a lock entrance may be provided in order\r\nto facilitate water traffic from Soochow as well as the inland water\r\nsystem directly with the wet dock.\r\n\r\nAs the first principle in our program was remuneration, all our\r\nplans must strictly follow this principle. To create Pootung Point,\r\ntherefore, as a civic center and to build a new Bund farther on along\r\nthe left bank of the new canal in order to increase the value of the\r\nnew land which would result from this scheme must be kept in mind.\r\nOnly by so doing would the construction of Shanghai as a deep harbor\r\nbe worth while. And only by creating some new and valuable property\r\nin this fore-doomed port could Shanghai be saved from the competition\r\nof our Projected Port. After all, the most important factor for\r\nthe salvation of Shanghai is the solution of the silt question of\r\nthe Yangtze Estuaries. Now let us see what effect and bearing the\r\nregulating of the Yangtze Channel and Embankments have upon the\r\nquestion, and this we are going to deal with in the next part.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nThe Regulating of the Yangtze River\r\n\r\nThe regulating of the Yangtze River may be divided as follows:\r\n\r\n  a. From the deep-water line of the sea to Whangpoo Junction.\r\n  b. From Whangpoo Junction to Kiangyin.\r\n  c. From Kiangyin to Wuhu.\r\n  d. From Wuhu to Tungliu.\r\n  e. From Tungliu to Wusueh.\r\n  f. From Wusueh to Hankow.\r\n\r\n\r\na. Regulating of the Estuary from Deep-water Line Up to the Junction of\r\nWhangpoo\r\n\r\nIt is a natural law that the obstruction to navigation in all rivers\r\nis begun at their mouths, therefore the improvement of any river\r\nfor navigation must start from the estuary. The Yangtze River is no\r\nexception to this rule, therefore to regulate the Yangtze, we must\r\nbegin by dealing with its estuaries.\r\n\r\nThe Yangtze has three estuaries, namely: The North Branch lying between\r\nthe left bank and the Island of Tsungming, the North Channel lying\r\nbetween the Tsungming Island and the Tungsha Banks and the South\r\nChannel lying between the Tungsha Banks and the right bank. Henceforth\r\nfor the sake of convenience I shall call them the North, Middle, and\r\nSouth Channels.\r\n\r\nThe silting up of a river's mouth is due to the loss of velocity in its\r\ncurrent when the water gets into the wide opening at its junction with\r\nthe sea and causes the silt to deposit there. The remedy is to maintain\r\nthe velocity of the current by narrowing the mouth of the river so that\r\nit equals that of the upper part. In this way the silt is suspended in\r\nthe water moving on into the deep sea. The narrowing process may be\r\naccomplished by walls or training jetties. And thus the silt may be\r\ncarried by the water into the deepest part of the open sea and before\r\nit settles down upon the bottom a returning tide will carry it from the\r\napproach into the shallow parts on both sides of the river's mouth. The\r\nmouth of a river can be kept clear from deposit of silt by the action\r\nand reaction of the ebb and flow tide. The conservancy of an estuary of\r\nany river is accomplished by utilizing these natural forces.\r\n\r\nIn order to regulate the estuary of the Yangtze we have to study the\r\nthree channels which form its mouth and to find out which of these\r\nchannels is to be selected as the regulated entrance into the sea. In\r\nMr. Von Heidenstam's proposal for the improvement of the approach of\r\nShanghai Harbor, he recommends two alternatives, viz., either to block\r\nup the North and Middle Channels and to leave the South Channel only\r\nfor the mouth of the Yangtze, or to train the South Channel only and\r\nleave the other two alone. For the present, he thinks, perhaps for the\r\nsake of economy, the latter scheme would be enough. But the training\r\nof the South Channel alone as the approach to Shanghai would leave it\r\nin a state of perpetual anxiety as has been apprehended by Mr. Von\r\nHeidenstam and other experts, for the main volume of the water of the\r\nYangtze may be diverted into either of the other two channels and leave\r\nthe Southern one to be silted up at any time. Therefore to make the\r\napproach of Shanghai once for all safe and permanent, it is necessary\r\nto block up two of the three channels, leaving only one as an approach\r\nto the port. This is also the only feasible way of regulating the\r\nestuary of the Yangtze.\r\n\r\nIn our scheme of regulating the Yangtze Estuary I should recommend\r\nusing the North Channel only and to block the other two. Because the\r\nNorth Channel is the shortest way to the deep-sea line and by using\r\nit as the only mouth of the Yangtze, we have on both sides of it more\r\nshallow banks to be reclaimed by its silt. Thus the expenditure would\r\nbe less and the results greater. But this would leave Shanghai in\r\nthe lurch. Therefore in a coöperative scheme like this I would apply\r\nthe theory of killing two birds with one stone by using the Middle\r\nChannel, since it would suit both of our purposes. The reason for this\r\nis because the regulating of the Yangtze Estuary and the securing of a\r\nShanghai approach have different purposes, hence we must consider them\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\nIn my project of regulating the Yangtze Estuary I have two aims,\r\nnamely, to secure a deep channel to the open sea and to save as much\r\nsilt as possible for the purpose of reclamation of land. The Middle\r\nChannel provides three ready receptacles for the deposit of the silt\r\nfor the formation of new land: the Haimen, the Tsungming, and the\r\nTungsha Banks. Besides these banks there are many hundreds of square\r\nmiles of shallow bottom which in the course of ten or twenty years will\r\nalso form land. As remuneration is our first principle we must consider\r\nit in every step of our progress. The reclamation of about a thousand\r\nsquare miles of land even in forty not to say twenty years would be\r\nample profit. At the lowest estimate the reclaimed land would be worth\r\ntwenty dollars per mow. If after ten years five hundred square miles\r\nwould be ready for cultivation purposes then we would gain a profit of\r\n38,000,000 dollars. Whereas to make an approach by the South Channel\r\nthe receptacle ground will be on one side only, that is, the Tungsha\r\nBanks, while on the right of the approach is the deep Hangchow Bay\r\nwhich would take hundreds of years to fill up, and in the meanwhile\r\nhalf of the silt would be wasted. To Shanghai as a seaport the silt is\r\na curse but to the shallow banks the silt would be a blessing.\r\n\r\nSince it is a profitable undertaking to reclaim the above mentioned\r\nbanks and the neighboring shallows, we can quite well afford to build\r\na double stone wall from the shore end of the Yangtze right out into\r\nthe deep sea far beyond Shaweishan Island which is a distance of about\r\nforty miles. A stone wall from one fathom to five fathoms in height\r\nat low-water level would likely not exceed an average cost of two\r\nhundred thousand dollars a mile as cheap stone can easily be obtained\r\nfrom the granite islands nearby, in the Chusan Archipelago. A wall of\r\nforty miles on each side that is eighty miles in all will cost sixteen\r\nmillion dollars or thereabouts. And considering that 200 or 300 square\r\nmiles of Haimen, Tsungming, and the Tungsha banks could be converted\r\ninto arable land within a short time, the expense of building the wall\r\nis well justified. Furthermore, the construction of this wall means\r\nthat there will be a safe and permanent approach for a world port in\r\nShanghai as well as a deep outlet for the Yangtze. See Map V.\r\n\r\nThe regulating wall on the right side should be built from the junction\r\nof the Whangpoo by prolongation of its right jetty describing a\r\ngentle curve into the depths of the South Channel and turning toward\r\nthe opposite side and cutting through the Blockhouse Island into the\r\nMiddle Channel, then running eastward right into the five-fathom line\r\nsoutheast of Shaweishan Island. The left wall would be a continuation\r\nfrom that of Tsungming at Tsungpaosha Island parallel with the right\r\nwall by a distance of about two miles. This wall should curve to a\r\npoint at or near Drinkwater Point at Tsungming Island, then project\r\ninto the five-fathom line at the open sea passing by just at the south\r\nside of the Shaweishan Island. A glance at the map here attached would\r\nbe sufficient to show how the future outlet of the Yangtze as well\r\nas the future approach of Shanghai should be. The two regulating\r\nsubmerged walls on both sides would be as high as low-water level so as\r\nto give a free passage of the water over the top at flood tide. This\r\nwill serve the purpose of carrying back the silt from the sea when\r\nthe tide comes in, thus to reclaim the shallow spaces inclosed behind\r\nthe walls on both sides of the river more quickly than otherwise. The\r\nnew channel formed by these two parallel walls would likely be deeper\r\nthan the present South Channel outside the Whangpoo, which is forty to\r\nfifty feet deep because the velocity of the current will be greater\r\nthan the present one, due to the concentration of three channels into\r\none. Furthermore, the depth would be more uniform and stable than at\r\npresent. Although the regulating walls end at the five-fathom line, the\r\nmomentum of the current would continue beyond that point, and so would\r\ncut into the deep water outside. This would serve the double purpose of\r\ndraining the Yangtze Estuary as well as keeping open the approach to\r\nShanghai.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP V]\r\n\r\n\r\nb. From Whangpoo Junction to Kiangyin\r\n\r\nThis part of the channel of the Yangtze River is most irregular and\r\nchangeable. The widest part is over ten miles while the Kiangyin Narrow\r\nis only but three-quarters of a mile. The depth of the channel at the\r\nopen part is from five to ten fathoms while that of Kiangyin Narrow\r\nis twenty fathoms. Judging by the depth of the water at this point a\r\nwidth of one and a half miles must be provided for the channel in order\r\nto slow down the current and to give a uniform velocity right along\r\nthe river. So the two-mile wide channel at Whangpoo Junction has to be\r\ntabulated into one mile and a half at Kiangyin. See Map VI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP VI]\r\n\r\nThe north or left embankment commencing at Tsungpao Sha continues with\r\nthe sea wall and makes a convex curve up to Tsungming Island at a point\r\nabout six miles northwest from Tsungming city. Then it follows along\r\nthe shore of Tsungming right up to Mason Point and transversing across\r\nthe north channel parallel to the north shore at a distance of three or\r\nfour miles right up to Kinshan Point, thence it cuts across the deep\r\nchannel which was formed in recent years and curves southwestward to\r\njoin the shore northeast of Tsingkiang and follows the shore line for\r\na distance of about seven or eight miles, then cuts into the land side\r\nto give this part of the river a width of one and a half miles from\r\nthe fort at the Kiangyin side. This embankment from Tsungpao Sha to\r\nTsingkiang Point opposite Kiangyin fort is about one hundred miles in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nSouth of Tsungming Island a part of this embankment and a part of the\r\nwall that projects into the sea together inclose a shallow space of\r\nabout 160 square miles good for reclamation purposes. The other part of\r\nthe embankment, which runs from Mason Point at the head of Tsungming\r\nIsland to Tsingkiang shore, incloses another space of about 130 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe right embankment starts at the end of the left jetty of Whangpoo\r\nJunction and, skirting along the Paoshan shore and passing the Blonde\r\nShoal into the deep, crosses the Confucius Channel on into Actaon\r\nShoal and follows the right side of Harvey Channel on to Plover Point.\r\nThen it turns northwest across the deep channel into Langshan Flats,\r\nthence recrosses the deep channel at Langshan crossing into Johnson\r\nFlats, then joins the Pitman King Island, and thence skirts along\r\nthe shore right into the foot of the hills at Kiangyin forts. This\r\nembankment incloses two shallow spaces: one above and the other below\r\nPlover Point, together about 160 square miles. Alongside of both of\r\nthese embankments there are shallow spaces amounting to about 450\r\nsquare miles, a great part of which having already formed land and a\r\npart already appearing in low water. When these spaces are cut off\r\nfrom the moving current the process of reclamation would be made to\r\nwork more rapidly so it is not extravagant to hope that within the\r\ncourse of twenty years the whole of these 450 square miles would be\r\ncompletely reclaimed and ready for cultivation. The profits from the\r\nnew lands thus reclaimed would amount to about $29,760,000 if only\r\ntaken at $20 per mow. The profits from the new lands would be netted\r\nfrom the beginning of the work and would increase every year up to the\r\ncompletion of the reclamation process.\r\n\r\nWith a profit of $30,000,000 in the course of twenty years before\r\nus, it is a worth-while proposition to take up. Now let us see what\r\namount of capital should be invested before the whole project of our\r\nreclamation work could be completed. In order to reclaim this 450\r\nsquare miles of land two hundred miles of embankments have to be built.\r\nPart of these projected embankments will be along the shore line, a\r\ngreater part will be in midstream, and a small part in deep channel.\r\nThose along the shore line need not be bothered with except that the\r\nconcave surface must be protected with stone or concrete work. Those\r\nin midstream should be filled up with stone ten feet or less below\r\nlow-water level just enough to give a resistance to the undercurrent in\r\norder to prevent it from running sideward. Thus the main current would\r\nfollow the line of least resistance and cut the channel, as directed by\r\nthe rudimental embankment, by its own force. This rudimental embankment\r\nwould cost less than the sea wall which I estimated at $200,000 per\r\nmile. Except at one point, that is, the junction of the North Channel\r\nat Mason Point, which has to be blocked up entirely, the cost for\r\nwhich, as has been estimated by experts, would amount to over a million\r\ndollars for a distance of two or three miles. Thus the profits accruing\r\nfrom the reclaimed lands would be quite sufficient to pay for the\r\nembankments. So far we see that the regulating of the Yangtze from the\r\nsea to Kiangyin is a self-paying proposition from the reclamation of\r\nland alone, aside from the improvement of the navigation of the Yangtze\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. From Kiangyin to Wuhu\r\n\r\nThis part of the river is quite different in nature from that below\r\nKiangyin. Its channel is more stable and only in a few places sharp\r\ncurves occur and the water has cut into the concave sides of the land,\r\nthus occasionally making new channels along the sides of the two\r\nshores. This section of the river is about 180 miles in length. See Map\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThe regulating works here would be more complicated than those below\r\nKiangyin. For besides the dilated parts which have to be reclaimed in\r\nthe same manner as those of the lower part of the river, the sharp\r\ncurves have to be straightened and side channels have to be blocked,\r\nand midstream islands have to be removed, and narrows have to be\r\nwidened to give uniform width to the river. However, most of the\r\nexisting embankments in this part could be left as they are except\r\nsome of the concave surfaces of the shores have to be protected by\r\neither stone or concrete work. The regulating works of the channel and\r\nthe embankments can be done by artificial means as well as by natural\r\nprocesses so as to economize as much as possible. The cost of the whole\r\nworks of this part of the river cannot be accurately estimated until\r\na detail survey is made; but in a rough guess $400,000 per mile may\r\nnot be very far from the mark. Thus 180 miles will cost $72,000,000\r\nexclusive of the expenses for the widening of the point between Nanking\r\nand Pukow, in which case valuable properties will have to be removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP VII]\r\n\r\nThe Kwachow cut is to straighten the three sharp curves in front of\r\nand above Chinkiang by converting them into one. Two and a half miles\r\nof the land in the northern shore opposite Chinkiang will have to\r\nbe cut into in order to form a new channel of a mile or more in width.\r\nThe part of the river in front of, and above and below Chinkiang has to\r\nbe reclaimed. The new land thus reclaimed would form the water front\r\nof Chinkiang city, the value of which may be sufficient to defray the\r\ncost of the work and compensate for the land taken away on the northern\r\nshore, to form the new channel. So the works of this part will be at\r\nleast a self-paying proposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP VIII]\r\n\r\nThe narrow between Pukow and Hsiakwan from pier to pier is barely six\r\ncables wide. The depth of the water in this narrow from the shallowest\r\nto the deepest is six to twenty-two fathoms. The land of the Hsiakwan\r\nside had occasionally sunk away on account of the too rapid current and\r\nthe depth of the water. This indicates that this part is too narrow\r\nfor the volume of the Yangtze water to pass. Therefore a wider passage\r\nmust be provided for. In order to do so, the whole town of Hsiakwan\r\nmust be sacrificed as the river must be widened right up to the foot\r\nof the Lion Hill, so as to provide a passage of a mile wide at this\r\npoint. What the cost for the compensation of this valuable property of\r\nHsiakwan will be will have to be submitted to the experts for a careful\r\ninvestigation before it can be determined. This will be the most\r\ncostly part of the whole project for the regulating of the Yangtze.\r\nBut undoubtedly some equally valuable property can be created along\r\nthe riverside near by in place of Hsiakwan, so that a balance may be\r\nrealized by the work itself.\r\n\r\nThe channel below the Nanking Pukow Narrow will follow the short\r\npassage alongside of the foot of the Mofushan to Wulungshan. The loop\r\naround the island north of Nanking will have to be blocked up in order\r\nto straighten the course of the river.\r\n\r\nThe section of the river from Nanking to Wuhu is almost in a straight\r\nline with three dilatations along its course one just above Nanking the\r\nother two just above and below the East and West pillars. To regulate\r\nthe first dilatation the channel above Me-tse-chow should be blocked up\r\nand the island outside of it should be partly cut to widen the proper\r\nchannel. To regulate the other two dilatations the river should be made\r\nto curve toward Taiping Fu to follow the deep channel on the right\r\nbank. The left channel should be blocked up. The islands along this\r\ncurve should be partly or wholly removed. To regulate the dilatation\r\nabove the Pillars, the Friends Channel should be blocked up and Friends\r\nIsland be partly cut away. And the left bank below Wuhu should also be\r\ncut to give the channel a uniform width.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. From Wuhu to Tungliu\r\n\r\nThis part of the river is about 130 miles in length. Along its course\r\nthere are six dilatations, the most prominent of which is the one that\r\nlies immediately below Tungling, which extends over ten miles from\r\nside to side. In each of these dilatations there are usually two or\r\nthree channels with newly formed islands between them. The deep passage\r\noften changes from one side to the other, and it is not uncommon that\r\nall of the channels are filled up at the same time, thus stopping\r\nnavigation altogether for a considerable period. See Map VIII.\r\n\r\nIn regulating the part of the river from ten miles above Wuhu to\r\nten miles below Tatung, I propose to cut a new channel through the\r\nmidstream islands formed by the three dilatations and the sharp corners\r\nof the shore, in order to straighten as well as to shorten the river,\r\nas marked by the dotted lines in the map attached here. The cost of the\r\ncut could not be estimated until a detail survey is made. But as soon\r\nas the embankments are laid out the natural force of the river's own\r\ncurrent will do a great part of the dredging work, so that the expenses\r\nof the cutting for the new channel will be much less than usual. Above\r\nTatung there are two sharp turns of the left shore to be cut. One is on\r\nthe left shore at the point where the beacon now stands about twelve\r\nmiles from Tatung. In this place a few miles of the left shore will\r\nhave to be cut away. The other cut is just below the city of Anking\r\nhence to Kianglung beacon, a distance of about six miles. By this cut\r\nwe do away with the sharp turns of the river at Chuan Kiang Kau. These\r\ncuttings would cost much more than the piling of stone at the lower\r\nreach of the river. It is quite certain that the reclamation of the\r\nside channels of this part will not cover the cost of the cuttings.\r\nTherefore this part of the regulating work will not be self-paying, but\r\nthe navigation of the Yangtze, the protection it gives to both sides\r\nof the land, and the prevention of floods in the future will amply\r\ncompensate for such work.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. From Tungliu to Wusueh\r\n\r\nThis part of the river is about eighty miles in length. The land\r\nalong the right bank is generally hilly while that along the left is\r\nlow. Along its course there are four dilatations. In three of these\r\ndilatations the current has cut into the left or northern bank of the\r\nriver and then turns back into its main course again almost at right\r\nangles. At such points the bank is very unstable. Between the channels\r\nof these dilatations islands are being formed. See Map IX.\r\n\r\nThe regulating works of this part are much easier to construct than\r\nthose of the lower part. The three diverting semicircular channels\r\nhave to be blocked up at the upper ends, and the lower openings left\r\nopen for silt to go into at flood seasons in order to reclaim them\r\nby the natural process. The other dilatations should be narrowed in\r\nfrom both sides by jetties. A few places will have to be cut, the most\r\nimportant being the Pigeon Island and the turn above Siau Ku Shan. Some\r\nof the midstream islands will have to be removed, and a few wide places\r\nfilled up in order to make the channel uniform, so as to give a regular\r\nminimum depth of six fathoms right along the whole course.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. From Wusueh to Hankow\r\n\r\nThis part of the river is about one hundred miles long. Above Wusueh we\r\nenter into the hilly country on both sides. The river here is generally\r\nabout half a mile wide, with a depth of from five to twelve fathoms or\r\nsometimes more in certain places. See Map X.\r\n\r\nTo regulate this part of the river a few wide spaces have to be\r\nreclaimed to give a uniform channel, and the side channels at three or\r\nfour places closed up. Then we can make a channel with a uniform depth\r\nof from six to eight fathoms at all seasons. At Collison Island section\r\nof the river the Ayres Channel has to be closed up, leaving the winter\r\nchannel alone so as to give a gentle curve above and below this island.\r\nAt Willes Island and Gravenor Island point the Round Channel and the\r\nchannel between these two islands must be blocked up. The river must be\r\nmade to cut through Willes Island to make a shorter curve. At Bouncer\r\nIsland the South channel must be blocked up and above this the Low\r\nPoint turn must be cut away to form a gentler curve. From this point to\r\nHankow the river should be made narrower first by reclaiming the right\r\nside as far as the meeting of the southwest curve with the right bank\r\nthen the reclamation should start at the opposite side of the left bank\r\nand right up along the front of Hankow Settlement until the Han River\r\nMouth is reached. Thus a depth of six to eight fathoms can be secured\r\nright up to the Bund of Hankow.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the whole length of the regulating course of the river from\r\nthe deep sea to Hankow is about 630 miles. The embankments will be\r\ntwice this length; that is, 1,260 miles. I have estimated that the sea\r\nwall at the mouth of the river could be built at $200,000 a mile, thus\r\nfor both sides $400,000 a mile will be sufficient for the 140 miles\r\nfrom the deep sea to Kiangyin. For, in this part we have only the two\r\nembankments to deal with, which merely requires the tumbling of stones\r\ninto the water until the pile is strong enough to hold the current to\r\na directed course. As soon as these stone ridges on both sides of the\r\nriver are formed, nature will do the rest to make the channel deep. The\r\nwork for this part, therefore, is simple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP IX]\r\n\r\nBut the work for certain sections of the upper part of the river is\r\nmore complicated as about fifty or sixty miles of solid land of from\r\nten to twenty feet above water level and thirty to forty feet below\r\nhave to be cut in order to straighten the river's course. Of this\r\ncutting and removing work, how much will have to be done artificially\r\nand how much can be done by nature, I leave to the experts to estimate.\r\nExcepting this, the other parts of this work, I think, cannot cost\r\nmuch more than $400,000 a mile. So that the whole work from the sea to\r\nHankow, a distance of 630 miles will cost about $252,000,000, or let\r\nus say, including the unknown part, $300,000,000 for the completion of\r\nthe entire project for the regulating of the Yangtze River. By this\r\nregulating of the Yangtze River, we secure an approach of 600 miles\r\ninland for ocean-going vessels into the very center of a continent\r\nof two hundred millions of people of which half or one hundred million\r\nis located immediately along 600 miles of the great water highway. As\r\nregards remuneration for the work, this project will be more profitable\r\nthan either the Suez or Panama Canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP X]\r\n\r\nAlthough we could not find means whereby the works above Kiangyin may\r\nbe made self-paying as those of the sections below by the reclamation\r\nof land, profit from city building along the course of the river can be\r\nrealized after the regulating work is completed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I must say that the figures given concerning the harbor\r\nworks and the Yangtze regulation are merely rough estimates which\r\nmust be in the nature of the case. As regards the costs of building\r\nthe rudimental dikes at the estuary of the Yangtze as well as along\r\nthe dilating parts of the river, the estimation may seem too low. But\r\nthe data on which I base my estimate are as follows: First, my own\r\nobservation of the private enterprise of reclamation by building dikes\r\nat the Canton delta around my native village; second, the cheap stone\r\nthat can be obtained at the Chusan Archipelago; third, the estimation\r\nof Mr. Tyler, Coast Inspector of the Maritime Customs for the blocking\r\nup of the North Channel at the upper end of Tsungming Island, where the\r\nnarrowest part is about three miles. He says that a million taels or\r\nmore is necessary for the work. Or, let us say, in round figures, five\r\nhundred thousand dollars (Mex.) a mile. This is two and a half times\r\nmy estimate. Now, let us compare the difference. The three-mile channel\r\nat the upper end of Tsungming has an average depth of twenty feet of\r\nwater, while in my project the sea wall or dikes will be built in water\r\nhaving an average of less than two thirds of this depth. Moreover, the\r\nwork of blocking up the North Channel entirely at a right angle is many\r\ntimes more costly than that of building a rudimental dike of the same\r\nlength in a parallel line with the current. Since five hundred thousand\r\ndollars are enough to block up cross-wise a mile of river twenty feet\r\ndeep, two fifths of that sum should be quite sufficient to finance\r\nthe work that I have projected. While writing this, I came across an\r\narticle in the _Chicago Railway Review_, May 17, 1919, dealing with the\r\nsame subject, which states that steel skeleton is a better and cheaper\r\nsubstitute for stone or other materials for building dikes and jetties\r\nin a muddy river like ours. Thus, by this new method, we may be able\r\nto construct embankments, with cheaper material than I have hitherto\r\nknown. So, although the estimate which I have made may be somewhat low,\r\nyet it is not so far from correct as it seems at first sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nThe Construction of River Ports\r\n\r\nThe construction of river ports along the Yangtze between Hankow and\r\nthe sea will be one of the most remunerative propositions in our\r\ndevelopment scheme. For this part of the Yangtze Valley is richest\r\nin agricultural and mineral products in China and is very densely\r\npopulated. With the cheap water transportation provided by the\r\ncompletion of the regulating work both sides of this water highway\r\nwill surely become industrial beehives. And with cheap labor near by,\r\nit will not be a surprise if in the near future both banks will become\r\ntwo continuous cities, as it were, right along the whole extent of the\r\nriver from Hankow to the sea. In the meantime a few suitable spots\r\nshould be chosen for profitable city development. For this purpose I\r\nwill start from the lower part of the river as follows:\r\n\r\n  a. Chinkiang and North Side.\r\n  b. Nanking and Pukow.\r\n  c. Wuhu.\r\n  d. Anking and South Side.\r\n  e. Poyang Port.\r\n  f. Wuhan.\r\n\r\n\r\na. Chinkiang and North Side\r\n\r\nChinkiang is situated at the junction of the Grand Canal and the\r\nYangtze. It was an important center of inland water traffic between the\r\nnorth and the south before the steam age. But it will resume its former\r\ngrandeur and become more important when the old inland waterway is\r\nimproved, and new ones are constructed. For it is the gateway between\r\nthe Hoangho and Yangtze valleys. Besides, by the southern portion of\r\nthe Grand Canal, Chinkiang is connected with the Tsientang valley--the\r\nrichest part of China. Thus, this city is bound to grow into a great\r\ncommercial center in the near future.\r\n\r\nIn our regulation work of the Yangtze, we shall add a piece of new\r\nland, over six square miles, in front of Chinkiang. This land on the\r\nsouth side of the river will be utilized for city-planning for our\r\nnew Chinkiang. On the north side, land should also be taken up by the\r\nstate to build another city. The north side will be bound to outgrow\r\nthat of the south for the whole of Hoangho Valley could only emerge\r\ninto the Yangtze by waterway through this point. Docks should be\r\nbuilt between here and Yangchow for accommodation of inland vessels,\r\nand modern facilities should be provided for transhipment between\r\ninland vessels and ocean-going steamers. This port should be made as\r\na distributing center as well as a collecting center for the salt of\r\nthe eastern coast. This, with the help of modern methods, will reduce\r\ntransportation expenses. Stone or concrete bunds or quays should be\r\nbuilt on both sides of the river and tidal jetties should be provided\r\nfor train ferries. In time, when commerce grows, tunnels or bridges may\r\nbe added to facilitate traffic of the two sides. The streets should be\r\nwide so as to meet modern demands. The water front and its neighborhood\r\nshould be planned for industrial and commercial uses and the land\r\nbeyond should be planned for residential purpose. Every modern public\r\nutility should be provided. In regard to the details of planning the\r\ncity, I must leave them to the expert.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. Nanking and Pukow\r\n\r\nNanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated\r\nin a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a\r\nvast level plain--a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It\r\nalso lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the\r\nlower Yangtze. At present, although ruined and desolate, it still has\r\na population of over a quarter of a million. Once it was the home of\r\nmany industries especially silk and now the finest satin and velvet are\r\nstill produced here. Nanking has yet a greater future before her when\r\nthe resources of the lower Yangtze Valley are properly developed.\r\n\r\nIn the regulation of the Yangtze I propose to cut away the town of\r\nHsiakwan, so that the wharf of Nanking could be removed into the deep\r\nchannel between Metsechow and the outskirt of Nanking. This channel\r\nshould be blocked up, thereby a wet dock could be formed to accommodate\r\nall ocean-going vessels. This point is much nearer the inhabited parts\r\nof the city than Hsiakwan. And the land between this projected wet\r\ndock and the city could form a new commercial and industrial quarter\r\nwhich would be many times larger than Hsiakwan. Metsechow in time,\r\nwhen commerce grows, may also be developed into city lots and business\r\nquarters. For the future development of Nanking the land within and\r\nwithout the city should be taken up at the present price under the\r\nsame principle which I have proposed for the Projected Port at Chapu.\r\n\r\nPukow, opposite Nanking, on the other side of the river, will be the\r\ngreat terminus of all the railways of the great northern plain to the\r\nYangtze. It will be the nearest river port for the rich coal and iron\r\nfields of Shansi and Honan, giving access to the lower Yangtze district\r\nand hence to the sea. As the great transcontinental trunk line to the\r\nsea whether terminating at Shanghai or at our Projected Port, would\r\npass through this point, the construction of a tunnel under the Yangtze\r\nto connect Nanking and Pukow by rail at the same time when the cities\r\nare being constructed, will not be at all premature. This will at once\r\nmake possible a through train journey from Shanghai to Peking.\r\n\r\nConcrete or stone embankment should be built along the shore above and\r\nbelow the present Pukow point many miles in each direction. Modern\r\nstreets should be laid out on the land within the embankment so as to\r\nbe ready for various building purposes. The land on the north side\r\nof the river should be taken up by the state for public uses of this\r\ninternational development scheme on the same basis as at our Projected\r\nPorts.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. Wuhu\r\n\r\nWuhu is a town of 120,000 inhabitants and is the center of the rice\r\ntrade in the lower part of the Yangtze. It is at this point that I\r\npropose to make an intake of the water which will go to flush the\r\nWhangpoo River at Shanghai, and which will form the upper end of a\r\ncanal to the sea at Chapu. In the regulating work of the Yangtze the\r\nconcave part above the junction of the Yangki Ho has to be filled\r\nup and the convex part of the opposite side has to be cut away. The\r\njunction of the projected canal and the river will be at about a\r\nmile or so below the Lukiang junction. The projected canal will run\r\nnortheast to a point between the southeast corner of Wuhu city and\r\nthe foot of the hill. There it joins the Yangki Ho and, following\r\nthe course as far as Paichiatien, branches off in the northeastern\r\ndirection. This gives Wuhu a southeast waterfront along the left side\r\nof the canal. New bunds should be built along both sides of the canal\r\nas well as alongside the Yangtze and at the junction of the canal\r\ndocks for inland vessels should be constructed with modern plants for\r\ntranshipment of goods. Wide streets should be laid out from the Bund\r\nof the Yangtze far into the inland following the direction of the\r\ncanal. The bund alongside the Yangtze should be reserved for commercial\r\npurposes and those alongside the canal for factories. Wuhu is in the\r\nmidst of a rich iron and coal field, so it will surely become an\r\nindustrial center when this iron and coal field is properly developed.\r\nCheap materials, cheap labor, and cheap foodstuffs are abundant at the\r\nspot waiting for modern science and machinery to turn them into greater\r\nwealth for the benefit of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. Anking and South Side\r\n\r\nAnking, the capital of Anhwei, was once a very important city but since\r\nits destruction by the Taiping war it has never recovered its former\r\ngreatness. Its present population is about 40,000 only. Its immediate\r\nneighborhood is very rich in mineral and agricultural products. The\r\ngreat tea district of Liu-an and the rich mineral district in the\r\nsoutheastern corner of Honan province will have to make Anking their\r\nshipping port when railways are developed. In the Yangtze Conservancy\r\nwork, the concave turn of the river in front and west of the city has\r\nto be filled up. This reclaimed land should be for the extension of a\r\nnew city, where modern transportation plants should be built.\r\n\r\nEagle Point, on the south side opposite Anking should be cut away to\r\nmake the river curve more gently and to give the channel a uniform\r\nwidth. A new city should be laid out at this point, for from here we\r\ncommand the vast tea districts of southern Anhwei and western Chekiang.\r\nThe rich inland city of Hweichow, with the highly productive country\r\naround it, will have to make this port its shipping station. As Wuhu\r\nis the center of the rice trade these twin cities of Anking will be\r\nthe centers of the tea trade. Like Wuhu, these twin cities are also\r\nsituated in the midst of rich iron and coal fields which will assist\r\nthem to become important industrial centers in the near future. So to\r\nbuild twin cities at this point of the river will be a very profitable\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. The Poyang Port\r\n\r\nI propose to construct a port at a point between the Poyang Lake and\r\nthe Yangtze River. This will be the sole port of the Kiangsi province.\r\nEvery city of this province is connected by natural waterways which,\r\nif improved, will become a splendid water transportation system. The\r\nprovince of Kiangsi has a population of 30,000,000 and is extremely\r\nrich in mineral resources. A modern port acting as a commercial and\r\nindustrial center for the development of this resourceful province\r\nwould be a most remunerative proposition in our project.\r\n\r\nThe site of the port will be on the west side of the entrance to the\r\nPoyang Lake and the right bank of the Yangtze. It will be an entirely\r\nnew city built on new ground, part of which will be reclaimed from\r\nthe shallow side of the lake. In the regulating work of the Poyang\r\nChannel, a training wall should be built from the foot of the Taku\r\nTang Hill to Swain Point opposite to Stone Bell Hill of Hukow. A\r\nclosed dock should be constructed within this training wall for the\r\naccommodation of inland water vessels. The city should be laid out\r\non the triangular space formed by the right bank of the Yangtze, the\r\nleft side of the Poyang Lake and the foot hill of the Lushan Mountain.\r\nThis triangle is about 10 miles on each side, excellent for city\r\ndevelopment. The porcelain industry should be established here instead\r\nof at Kingteh Chen, for great damages often occur owing to the lack\r\nof transportation facilities, and to the necessity of transhipment\r\nfor the export of the finished articles from the latter place. Modern\r\nplants on a large scale should be adopted for the manufacturing of\r\ncheap wares as well as fine articles in our projected Poyang Port,\r\nfor here we shall have the greater advantage of collecting raw\r\nmaterials than at Kingteh Chen. Thus the concentrating of the various\r\nmanufactures in an advantageous center will result in quickening the\r\ngrowth of our new city. This Poyang Port is bound to grow into one\r\nof the great commercial and manufacturing centers in China, judging\r\nfrom the possibilities of Kiangsi alone. It will not only be a great\r\nshipping port of the Yangtze but will also be a railway center between\r\nNorth and South China. Thus to develop this port on a large scale is\r\nquite justifiable from an economic point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. Wuhan\r\n\r\nWuhan signifies the three cities of Wuchang, Hankow, and Hanyang. This\r\npoint is the headwater of our projected ocean passage, the pivot of\r\nthe railway system of China Proper, and will become the most important\r\ncommercial metropolis in the country. The population of these three\r\ncities is over a million and could be easily doubled or trebled if\r\nimprovements would be made. At present, Hanyang possesses the largest\r\niron works in China, and Hankow, many modern industries, while Wuchang\r\nis becoming a great cotton manufacturing city. Besides, Hankow is the\r\ntrade center of Central and West China, and the greatest tea market\r\nwe have. The provinces of Hupeh, Hunan, Szechuen, and Kweichow and a\r\npart of Honan, Shensi, and Kansu all depend upon Hankow as their only\r\nport in the outside world. When railways are developed in China, Wuhan\r\nwill be still more important and will surely become one of the greatest\r\ncities in the world. So in planning the future city of Wuhan we must\r\nadopt for its development a scale as large as that of New York or\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIn the regulation of the Yangtze embankments, we have to reclaim the\r\nfront of Hankow from the jetty of Lungwangmiao at the junction of the\r\nHan River right along the left bank to the point where the Yangtze\r\nturns eastward. This reclaimed space will be at an average of about\r\n500 to 600 yards wide. This will narrow down the river at this part\r\nto give a uniform channel of 5 to 6 cables in width and to give the\r\nHankow settlement a strip of valuable land along its waterfront. This\r\nwill also help to pay a part of the expenses for city construction. The\r\nsharp bend of the Han River just before it joins the Yangtze should\r\nbe straightened so as to make a gentler curve around Lungwangmiao\r\nPoint and thus enable the currents of both rivers to flow in the same\r\ndirection at their junction. The Hanyang embankment will follow pretty\r\nclosely the present shore line but not beyond the iron works jetty.\r\nThe wide space of the river above Wuchang city should be walled in to\r\nmake a closed dock for inland water as well as ocean going vessels.\r\nBelow Wuchang, an embankment parallel to that of the left side should\r\nbe built so as to make the future city extend far below the present\r\none. A tunnel should be constructed to connect both embankments at a\r\npoint where the Kinghan railway makes its first turn when it comes to\r\nthe Yangtze River. And another tunnel or bridge should be constructed\r\nbetween Hankow and Hanyang on one side and Wuchang on the other at\r\nthe junction of the Han River and the Yangtze. Additional tunnels or\r\nbridges may be constructed at different points when the city grows\r\nlarger in the future. All the outlying land of these trio-cities should\r\nbe taken up on the same basis as at our projected seaports, so that\r\nprivate monopoly and speculation in land may be prevented, and that\r\nthe unearned increment will go to the State to help the payment of\r\ncapital and interest on the foreign loans which are to be made in this\r\ninternational development scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nThe Improvement of the Existing Waterways and Canals\r\n\r\nThe existing waterways and canals in connection with the Yangtze may be\r\nenumerated as follows:\r\n\r\n  a. The Grand Canal.\r\n  b. The Hweiho.\r\n  c. The Kiangnan Waterway System.\r\n  d. The Poyang Waterway System.\r\n  e. The Han River.\r\n  f. The Tungting System.\r\n  g. The Upper Yangtze.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Grand Canal\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canal connects with the Yangtze at a point opposite Chinkiang\r\nand runs northward right up to Tientsin, a distance of over 600 miles.\r\nWe understand that a detailed survey of the Kiangpeh part of the canal\r\nhas begun and the work of improving it will commence soon. In our\r\nproject, I propose to substitute the Kiangpeh portion of the Grand\r\nCanal by the Yangtze outlet of the Hweiho.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Hweiho\r\n\r\nThe Hweiho rises in the northwest corner of Honan and runs southeast\r\nand east to the north of Anhwei and Kiangsu. Its outlets have been\r\nsealed up in recent years so its water has accumulated in the Hungtse\r\nLake and it depends upon evaporation as its only means of disposing\r\nthe water. Thus in the heavy rainy season, it floods a vast extent of\r\nthe country surrounding the lake and causes great misery to millions\r\nof people. So the conservancy of the Hweiho is a very urgent question\r\nof China to-day. Recently many investigations have been made and many\r\nplans proposed. Mr. Jameson, chief engineer for the American Red Cross\r\nSociety, has proposed two outlets for the Hweiho: one following the\r\nold course of the Yellow River to the sea and another through Paoying\r\nand Kao-yu Lakes to the Yangtze. In this project I propose to follow\r\nMr. Jameson's plan for the sea outlet only as far as the old Yellow\r\nRiver and for the Yangtze outlet only as far as Yangchow. When the sea\r\noutlet or north branch reaches the old Yellow River I will lead it\r\nacross into the Yenho and follow the Yenho to its northern turn. From\r\nthere, we cut across the narrow strip of land into the Kuanho which\r\nenters the sea at the nearest deep water line. This saves a great deal\r\nof work of excavating the old course of the Hoangho. When the southern\r\nbranch reaches Yangchow, I propose to make the canal pass east of that\r\ncity instead of west as Mr. Jameson proposed, so that its current will\r\njoin the Yangtze in the same direction at the new curve below Chinkiang\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nBoth of these outlets or branches of the Hweiho should be made at least\r\ntwenty feet deep right along, so that coastal vessels from the north\r\nto the Yangtze could use them as passage instead of going round the\r\nYangtze estuary, thus shortening the distance by about 300 miles. And\r\nwith twenty feet depth for both outlets, the Hweiho and the Hungtse\r\nLake would be well drained and the present bottom of the lake, which is\r\nsixteen feet above sea level would be converted into agricultural land\r\nat once. Thus 6,000,000 mow of land could be reclaimed according to the\r\nestimate of Mr. Jameson, from the Hungtse and the neighboring lakes.\r\nIf twenty dollars a mow be taken for its value, a sum of $120,000,000\r\ncould be netted. Besides this direct profit to the Government, there\r\nis an area of some 17,000 square miles of occasionally flooded land\r\nwhich would be made flood-proof so that normally we shall have two\r\ncrops a year instead of two only in five years. That is to say, the\r\n17,000 square miles or 10,880,000 acres will be made to produce five\r\ntimes more than at present. For instance, if the value of the gross\r\nproduction be estimated at fifty dollars an acre, then the total value\r\nwould be $544,000,000 Mex. and five times this sum would amount to\r\n$2,720,000,000 Mex. What an enormous profit to the country!\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The Kiangnan Waterway System\r\n\r\nThis system comprises the South Grand Canal, the Whangpoo, the Taihu,\r\nand its connections. The most important improvement I intend to make\r\nhere is to widen and deepen the Wuhu-Ihsing Waterway between the\r\nYangtze and the Taihu, and from there to dredge a deep channel right\r\nthrough the Taihu to a point midway of the Grand Canal between Suchow\r\nand Kashing. At Kashing, divide it into two branches:--one following\r\nthe Kashing Sunkiang Canal to Whangpoo, and the other, to the Projected\r\nPort at Chapu. This waterway between the Yangtze and the Whangpoo,\r\nbefore it reaches Shanghai, should be made as wide and deep as possible\r\nso as to make it carry sufficient water to flush the Shanghai harbor\r\nas well as to provide a shorter passage for inland water vessels\r\nbetween the Yangtze and the seaports. This waterway will act as silt\r\ncarrier by which the Taihu and the various lakes alongside of it may\r\nbe reclaimed in the future. Besides the main object for which this\r\ncanal is assigned, the reclamation scheme and the local traffic would\r\nalso add profit to it. This makes its remuneration doubly sure. As no\r\naccurate surveys of the shallow Taihu and other lakes and swamps could\r\nbe obtained, the exact number of mow to be reclaimed could not be given\r\nhere. But in a rough estimate I should say that the reclaimed space\r\nof the Kiangnan Lakes would be about the same in extent as those of\r\nKiangpeh (the North of the Yangtze).\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The Poyang Waterway System\r\n\r\nThis system drains the entire area of Kiangzi province. Every hsien,\r\ncity, and important town is reached by waterway. Waterways are the only\r\nmeans of communication in this province as well as in all the provinces\r\nof Southeastern China, before the advent of railways. The lower part of\r\nthe Kiangsi waterway system suffers the same irregularities as those\r\nof the lower Yangtze as both are on low land. So, to regulate it, a\r\nsimilar work as that for the Yangtze should be applied. The Poyang Lake\r\nshould be divided by deep channels from the junction of each river,\r\nand these should join together to form larger channels and finally\r\nunite into one main channel at a point near Chuki and, running through\r\nthe narrow part of the lake, join the Yangtze at Hukow. The sides of\r\nthe deep channels should be lined with submerged stone ridges as high\r\nas the shallow part of the lake, whereby the channels would serve the\r\npurpose of draining as well as of navigation.\r\n\r\nThe shallow space beside those channels will be reclaimed into arable\r\nland in due time. So the work of regulating the Poyang channels will be\r\nwell paid by reclamation.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. The Han River\r\n\r\nThis river is navigable for small crafts through its main body up to\r\nHanchung in the southwest corner of Shensi; and through its branches\r\nup to Nanyang and Shekichen in the southwest corner of Honan. This\r\nnavigable stream commands quite a large area of watershed. The upper\r\npart, that is above Siangyang, is in mountainous country. From\r\nSiangyang to Shayang it is in a wide, open valley and below Shayang it\r\nruns into the Hupeh swamp.\r\n\r\nTo improve this river dams should be built above Siangyang in order\r\nto utilize water power as well as to make locks for larger crafts to\r\nascend to the navigable point now navigable only for small crafts.\r\nBelow Siangyang, where the river is very wide and shallow, rudimental\r\ndikes should be constructed of stones or piles in order to restrict\r\nits channel and to reclaim the shallow space on both sides by natural\r\nprocess. In the swamp, the river should be straightened and deepened.\r\nA new canal between the Han and the Yangtze at Shasi should be\r\nconstructed to provide a shorter passage between Hankow and Shasi and\r\nbeyond. This canal in the swamp should be open to the lakes along its\r\ncourse so as to let the silt-carrying water enter into them in the\r\nflood season, thus filling them up quicker.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. The Tungting System\r\n\r\nThis system of waterway drains the whole province of Hunan and beyond.\r\nThe most important branches are the Siangkiang and the Yuankiang. The\r\nformer runs through Hunan into the northeast corner of Kwangsi province\r\nand connects with the Sikiang system by a canal near Kweilin. The\r\nlatter runs across the west border of Hunan into the eastern part of\r\nKweichow province. Both could be improved for the navigation of large\r\ncrafts. The canal between the Yangtze and the Sikiang watersheds should\r\nbe reconstructed and modern locks should be provided in it as well as\r\nalong the two waterways. Thus, vessels of ten feet draught may freely\r\npass between the Yangtze and the Sikiang. The Tungting Lake should be\r\ndrained by deep channels in the same manner as the Poyang Lake, and its\r\nshallow space reclaimed by natural process.\r\n\r\n\r\ng. The Upper Yangtze\r\n\r\nI include the part from Hankow to Ichang also in the Upper Yangtze,\r\nbecause it is at Hankow that the ocean navigation ends, and the inland\r\nwater communication begins. So, in dealing with the improvement of the\r\nUpper Yangtze, I will begin at Hankow. At present the Upper Yangtze is\r\nnavigable for shallow draught steamers up to Kiating, a point about\r\n1,100 miles above Hankow by river. If improvement be made farther on,\r\nthan shallow draught steamers could navigate right up to Chengtu, the\r\ncapital of Szechuen province, and the center of the richest plain in\r\nWest China, about sixty miles up the Min River.\r\n\r\nTo improve the Upper Yangtze from Hankow to Yochow, the work is much\r\nsimilar to that of the lower part. The channel should be regulated\r\nby rudimental dikes. The concave embankments in sharp bends should\r\nbe protected by stone or concrete; obstacles in midstream should be\r\nremoved. The great loop, called the Farmer Bend, above Kinkow, should\r\nbe cut through at the neck of Paichow, and the sharp point of Hanchin\r\nKwang should be cut away to make the curve of the river more gentle.\r\n\r\nThe tortuous part of the Yangtze, north of the Tungting Lake, between\r\nKinho Kow and Skipper Point, should be blocked up altogether and a\r\nnew channel made through Tungting Lake, returning to the Yangtze by\r\nthe Yochow Channel. This avoids the crooked passage and shortens the\r\nriver course considerably. From Skipper Point to Ichang the dilatations\r\nshould be restricted by dikes of stone or piling, and some sharp points\r\nof the shores should be cut away to make the curves more gentle.\r\n\r\nThe Yangtze River above Ichang enters the Gorges which run about a\r\nhundred miles up to the Szechuen depression, known as the Red Basin.\r\nThis part of the river from Ichang right along to its source is\r\nconfined by rocky banks, very narrow and deep, having an average depth\r\nof six fathoms and at some particular points even thirty fathoms. Many\r\nrapids and obstructions occur along its course.\r\n\r\nTo improve the Upper Yangtze, the rapids should be dammed up to form\r\nlocks to enable crafts to ascend the river as well as to generate water\r\npower. Obstructions should be blasted and boulders removed. Thus, a\r\nten-foot channel right along from Hankow to Chungking could be obtained\r\nso that through inland water transportation could be established\r\nfrom Chungking to Peking in the north and to Canton in the south, as\r\nwell as to all navigable points in China Proper all the year round.\r\nIn this way, transportation expenses to the richest emporium in West\r\nChina could be reduced hundredfold. The benefit to the people will be\r\nenormous and the encouragement to commerce will indeed be great.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nThe Establishment of Large Cement Works\r\n\r\nSteel and cement are the basis of modern construction, and the most\r\nimportant factors of the material civilization of the present age. In\r\nthe various projects of our development scheme, the demand for steel\r\nand cement will be so enormous that all manufacturing countries\r\ncombined will not be able to supply the needs. Therefore, in our first\r\nprogram, I have proposed to establish large steel works in the rich\r\niron and coal fields in the provinces of Shansi and Chili; so in this\r\nsecond program I propose to establish large cement works along the\r\nshores of the Yangtze River. The Yangtze Valley is exceptionally rich\r\nin materials for cement,--limestone and coal lying side by side at the\r\nwater edge along the navigable channel from Chinkiang upward. Thus,\r\nlocal supplies could be created for local needs.\r\n\r\nAt present, there is one cement works at Shihuiyau near Hoangshikang\r\nat the upper reach. It is situated between a deep water wharf and a\r\nlimestone hill. The limestone is so near by that it can be cut and\r\nshoveled into the kilns immediately. Between Hankow and Kiukiang there\r\nare many places possessing the same advantage. Below Kiukiang, there\r\nare also many such advantageous positions as Matang, Wushiki and many\r\nothers between Kiukiang and Anking. Between Anking and Nanking there\r\nare exceptionally good locations for putting up cement works such\r\nas Tatung, Tikang, and Tsaishisze, all these places being provided\r\nabundantly with limestone and coal and iron, lying side by side.\r\n\r\nWith the huge harbor works, city building, and embankment construction,\r\nthe market for cement will be so great that a capital of one to two\r\nhundred million dollars should be invested for the supply. This work\r\nshould be started gradually in accord with the acceleration of the\r\nother works of the general development so that one project will further\r\nthe other, and over-production and waste of capital individually in any\r\nof the parts of the general scheme will be guarded against. This will\r\nhelp make each of them a profitable business by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main feature of the third program will be the construction\r\nof a great southern port which will complete the plan for three\r\nfirst-class seaports in China as proposed in the preliminary part of\r\nthis International Development Scheme. Our Great Southern Port will\r\nnaturally be Canton, which is not only the center of commerce in South\r\nChina but also the largest city in all China. Until recent times it\r\nwas the largest city on the coasts of the Pacific, and the center of\r\ncommerce of Asia. With the development of China, Canton will surely\r\nresume its former importance. Around this southern metropolis I\r\nformulate the third program as follows:\r\n\r\n      I. The Improvement of Canton as a World Port.\r\n\r\n     II. The Improvement of the Waterway System of Canton.\r\n\r\n    III. The Construction of the Southwestern Railway System of\r\n         China.\r\n\r\n     IV. The Construction of Coast Ports and Fishing Harbors.\r\n\r\n      V. The Establishment of Shipbuilding Yards.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nThe Improvement of Canton as a World Port\r\n\r\nCanton's position as a seaport has been taken away by Hongkong since\r\nits cession to England after the Opium War. But as a commercial center\r\nof South China, Canton still holds its own, despite the advantages of\r\ndeep-water harbor, the artificial improvements of Hongkong, and the\r\npolitical dominance of England. The loss of its position as a seaport\r\nis entirely due to the ignorance of the Chinese people who never made\r\nany combined effort to improve the welfare of the country, and also\r\nto the corrupt government and officials of the Manchu dynasty. Since\r\nthe establishment of the Republic, the people have begun to awake\r\nvery rapidly and many schemes have been suggested to make Canton a\r\nseaport. This awakening of the millions of Chinese has caused much\r\napprehension to the Hongkong Government. The authorities of that colony\r\nhave been doing their utmost to hinder every move to restore Canton\r\nas a seaport and try to nip every scheme in the bud. Of course, if\r\nCanton is improved and made into a world port, then all the services\r\nthat Hongkong performs for her as a shipping stage would be dispensed\r\nwith altogether. But a developed Canton and a prosperous China will\r\nrecompense Hongkong in various ways a hundred times more than its\r\npresent position as the monopolized ocean port of a backward and poor\r\nChina. Just look at the port of Victoria in British Columbia, which\r\nwas once the only seaport of West Canada as well as the Northwestern\r\nregion of the United States, but it prospered very little then with an\r\nundeveloped hinterland despite its monopolistic character. Whereas as\r\nsoon as the rival ports arose, Vancouver on its own side, and Seattle\r\nand Tacoma on the American side, all within the same distance as\r\nHongkong is to Canton, all of them because of a developed hinterland\r\nprospered wonderfully, despite the keen competition between them as\r\nseaports. Thus, we see that competitive seaports like Vancouver,\r\nSeattle, and Tacoma instead of killing Victoria, as was once supposed\r\nby shortsighted people, have made it more prosperous than ever. Then,\r\nwhy doubt that a prosperous Canton and a developed China would not give\r\nthe same result to Hongkong? This is but a natural outcome. Therefore,\r\nthere should be no fear that a prosperous Canton and a developed\r\nChina would be harmful to Hongkong as a free port. So, instead of\r\ndoing the utmost as hitherto to hinder the development of Canton as a\r\nseaport, the Hongkong authorities should do their utmost to encourage\r\nsuch a project. Besides, the development of Canton and South China\r\nwill benefit the English as a whole commercially a hundred times more\r\nthan Hongkong can do at present. Although the local authorities of\r\nthat crown colony do not see far enough to realize it, however, I\r\nbelieve that the great statesmen and captains of industries in the now\r\nmightiest empire of the world would surely see it. With this belief\r\nin my mind I feel quite safe in giving publicity to the scheme of my\r\ninternational development of Canton as a world port in South China.\r\n\r\nCanton is situated at the head of the Canton Delta, which is formed by\r\nthe junction of three rivers--the Sikiang or West River, the Peikiang\r\nor North River, and the Tungkiang or East River. The area of this\r\ndelta is about 3,000 square miles and it has the most fertile alluvial\r\nsoil known in China. The land yields three crops a year--two crops of\r\nrice and one crop of other products such as potatoes or beets. In silk\r\nculture, it gives eight crops every year. The most delicious fruits of\r\nmany varieties are produced in this delta. This is the most thickly\r\npopulated district of all China. Within this delta and its immediate\r\nneighborhood, more than half of the population of Kwangtung province is\r\nfound. This is the reason why, despite the great productivity of this\r\nfertile delta, large quantities of foods have to be supplied by the\r\nsurrounding country as well as by foreign imports. Before the age of\r\nmachinery Canton for centuries was well known as an industrial center\r\nof Eastern Asia. The workmanship and handicraft of its people are still\r\nunequaled in many parts of the world. If machinery will be introduced\r\nin its industries under our international development scheme, Canton\r\nwill soon recover its former grandeur as a great manufacturing center.\r\n\r\nAs a world port, Canton is in a most advantageous position. Being\r\nsituated at the junction of three navigable rivers and at the head of\r\nthe ocean navigation it is a pivot of inland water as well as ocean\r\ncommunication in South China. If the Southwestern railway system is\r\ncompleted, then Canton will be equal in importance to the two great\r\nports in North and East China, in regard to transportation facilities.\r\nThe ocean approach of Canton is generally deep excepting at two points\r\nwhich can be easily trained and dredged to enable modern liners to\r\npass in and out at any hour. The deep water line of the ocean reaches\r\nup to Lingting Island, where the depth is from 8 to 10 fathoms. Above\r\nLingting, the channel gets shallower (about 3 or 4 fathoms) and runs\r\nabout 15 miles up to the Fumen Entrance. From this point the water\r\nbecomes deep again (between 6 and 10 fathoms) right up to the Second\r\nBar--a distance of 20 miles. At the Second Bar, the water is about 18\r\nto 20 feet deep for only a few hundred yards. After crossing the Second\r\nBar, the water becomes deep again for a distance of 10 miles averaging\r\nabout 30 feet deep up to the First Bar which will be the city limit of\r\nour future Canton.\r\n\r\nTo improve the Approach to Canton, I suggest that two submerged\r\ntraining walls be built at the left side of Canton Estuary above\r\nLingting Island--one from the shore to the head of the Kongsu Bank, and\r\nanother from the end of the same bank to the head of the Lingting Bank.\r\nThe first training wall will be 3 to 4 feet under water just at the\r\nsame level of the bank. The second wall will be from 4 feet at one end\r\nto 16 feet at the other, which are the levels of the respective banks\r\nwhich it connects. (See (1) (3) Map XI.) It will cross a channel of 24\r\nfeet deep between them. These two walls together with the four-foot\r\nKongsu Bank will act as one continuous wall and will direct the\r\nundercurrent which now runs between the left shore and Lingting Bank,\r\ninto the middle part of the estuary, thus cutting a channel between the\r\nbar and the bank of the same name to meet the deep water on the west\r\nside of Lingting Island. On the right side of the Canton Estuary, a\r\ntraining wall should be built from the lower part of Fraser Bank in a\r\nsoutheasterly direction across the 24-foot channel into the Lingting\r\nBar ending at the east edge of that bar. (See (2) Map XI.) Thus,\r\nwith these submerged walls on both sides of the estuary to confine\r\nthe undercurrent in the middle, a very deep channel can be formed to\r\nconnect with the Fumen Entrance at one end and the Lingting trough at\r\nthe other both of which are about 50 feet deep so that a thoroughfare\r\nfrom deep sea right up to the Second Bar of the Pearl River will be\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nThese submerged sea walls taken together are about 8 miles in length\r\nand will be built only 6 to 12 feet from the bottom of the sea. The\r\nexpenses will not be much while the acceleration of the natural\r\nreclamation process will be very great. Thus, the lands that will\r\nbe formed on both sides by these walls will far more than repay the\r\nexpenses of the work of building these walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP XI]\r\n\r\nTo regulate the Approach of Canton, in that part of the Pearl River\r\nfrom the Fumen Entrance to Whampoa, I suggest that the East River\r\nEstuaries be concentrated in a single outlet by using the uppermost\r\nchannel which joins the Pearl River at the lower point of Davids\r\nIsland. The other outlets of the East River, which joins the Pearl\r\nRiver below the Second Bar, should be closed up by dams built to the\r\nheight of the normal water level so as to permit them to serve as flood\r\nchannels in the rainy season. By concentrating the whole volume of\r\nwater of the East River above the Second Bar, a stronger current could\r\nbe obtained to flush the upper part of this section of the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP XII]\r\n\r\nIn the training works of this section, I propose that several jetties\r\nshould be built as follows: First, a jetty from Elliot Island at point\r\n(A) to the farther side of Calcutta Shoal opposite the lower point of\r\nParker Island. This will block the current between Elliot Island and\r\nCalcutta Shoal and divert it into the present 36-foot channel thus\r\nmaking it deeper by its natural force. Second, another jetty from\r\nBolton Island, at point (B) to midstream terminating at the lower side\r\nof the Second Bar, on the right side of the river. Third, a jetty from\r\nthe lower point of Pattinger Island at (C) to midstream terminating\r\nat the lower side of the same bar on the left side of the river. Thus\r\nthe Second Bar would be flushed by the concentrated current created\r\nby these two jetties. The shallow bottom above these jetties should\r\nbe dredged to the required depth. If a rocky bottom is found at this\r\nbar it should be blasted and removed, so as to give a uniform depth to\r\nthe whole approach. Fourth, the channel between the right bank of the\r\nriver and Bolton Island should be blocked up at (D). Fifth, a jetty\r\nfrom Pattinger Island at (E) to the head of the Second Bar Bank in\r\nmidstream so as to cut off the current at the left side of the river\r\nand to increase the velocity in the middle channel. Sixth, a jetty\r\nfrom the right shore at (F) about midway between Danes Island and the\r\nSecond Bar, should be built to the head of the Midstream Shoal so as\r\nto cut off the current at the right side of the river. And seventh,\r\nanother jetty from the lower point of Davids Island at (G) to midstream\r\nopposite to the end of jetty (F). Jetties (G) and (F) will concentrate\r\nthe current of the upper Pearl River while at the same time jetty (G)\r\nwill also turn the East River current into the same direction as that\r\nof the Pearl River. (See Map XII.)\r\n\r\nBy these seven jetties, the current between Whampoa and Fumen could be\r\ncontrolled and the bottom of the river flushed to a depth of 40 feet or\r\nmore, thus creating a thoroughfare for ocean-going steamers from the\r\nopen sea right up to the city of Canton. These jetties taken together\r\nwill be not more than 5 miles in length and mostly in very shallow\r\nwater. After the building of these jetties, land will be rapidly formed\r\nbetween jetties along both sides of the channel by natural process.\r\nThe reclaimed land alone will be quite enough to pay the expenses of\r\nconstructing these jetties, aside from the fact that the main object\r\nof regulating the river and opening up a deep channel for ocean\r\ntransportation will have been realized.\r\n\r\nHaving dealt with the approach to Canton, we may now take up the\r\nimprovement of Canton City itself as a world port. The harbor limit of\r\nCanton will be at the First Bar. From there, the harbor will follow the\r\ndeep water of Cambridge Reach and the water between Whampoa and Danes\r\nIsland into American Reach. At this point it will cut through Actaeon\r\nIsland to the south of Honam Island and follow the Elliot Passage to\r\nMariners Island. From Mariners Island following the Fatshan Creek, a\r\nstraight channel should be cut in a southwesterly direction to the\r\nTamchow Channel. Thus, a new waterway will be made from the First Bar\r\nto Tamchow Channel, a distance of about 25 miles. This waterway will be\r\nthe main outlet of the North River as well as a thoroughfare for the\r\nWest River, and will also serve as the harbor of Canton. By conveying\r\nall the water of the North River and a part of that of the West River\r\nthrough this waterway, the current will be strong enough to flush the\r\nharbor to a depth of 40 feet or more. (See Map XIII.)\r\n\r\nThe new city of Canton will be extended from Whampoa to Fatshan,\r\nseparated by the Macao Fort and Shameen Reaches. The section that lies\r\neast of this water should be developed into commercial quarters and\r\nthat west of it into factory quarters. The factory section should be\r\ntransected by canals connecting with the Fati and Fatshan creeks so\r\nas to give cheap transportation facilities to every factory. In the\r\ncommercial section, tidal wharves with modern plants and warehouses\r\nshould be provided. A bund should be built from the First Bar Island\r\nalong the north side of the new waterway, the west side of Honam to\r\nconnect with the bund of Shameen, and the northwestern side of Canton\r\ncity. Another bund should be built from above Fati along the east side\r\nof Fati Island to Mariners Island thence turning southwest along the\r\nleft bank of the new waterway. The Front Reach, that is, the river\r\nbetween the present Canton city and Honam Island should be filled up\r\nfrom the upper point of Honam to Whampoa for city building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP XIII]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the question of remuneration, the development of Canton\r\nas a world port will be the most profitable undertaking of the kind in\r\nthe International Development Scheme. Because, besides its commanding\r\nposition as a commercial metropolis and its possession of advantageous\r\nfacilities as a manufacturing center of South China, a modern\r\nresidential city is in great demand in this part of the country. The\r\nwell-to-do people and merchants of this rich delta as well as those\r\nretired Chinese merchants and millionaires abroad all over the world\r\nare very eager to spend their remaining days at home. But owing to the\r\nlack of modern conveniences and comforts they reluctantly remain in\r\nforeign countries. Thus to build a new city with modern equipments for\r\nresidential purposes alone, in Canton, would pay splendidly. The land\r\noutside of Canton is at present about 200 dollars a mow. If the land\r\nmarked off for the future city of Canton should be taken up by the\r\nState on the same basis as elsewhere in this International Development\r\nScheme, immediately after the streets are laid out and improvements\r\nmade, the price of land would rise from ten to fifty times its original\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP XIV]\r\n\r\nThe landscape of the environment of Canton is exceptionally beautiful\r\nand charming. It is an ideal place for planning a garden city with\r\nattractive parks. The location of the city of Canton resembles that\r\nof Nanking but is of greater magnitude and beauty. It possesses three\r\nnatural elements--deep water, high mountains, and vast extent of level\r\nland which furnish facilities for an industrial and commercial center\r\nand provide as well natural scenery for the enjoyment of man. The\r\nbeautiful valleys and hills of the northern shore of the Pearl River\r\ncould be laid out for ideal winter resorts and the high mountain tops\r\ncould be utilized for summer resorts.\r\n\r\nWithin the city limits at the northwest corner, a rich coal field has\r\nbeen found. When the coal is mined and modern plants for generating\r\nelectricity and producing gas are provided, then cheap electricity and\r\ngas could be had for transportation, for manufacturing, for lighting,\r\nheating, and cooking purposes. And so the present wasteful methods of\r\ntransportation, and expensive fuels for manufacturing and cooking for\r\nthe populous city of Canton can be done away with entirely. Thus great\r\neconomic wonders could be wrought by such improvements. The present\r\npopulation of Canton is over a million and if our development plan is\r\ncarried out, this city would grow in leaps and bounds within a very\r\nshort time. The population will become greater than any other city and\r\nthe profit of our undertaking will become correspondingly large.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nThe Improvement of the Waterway System of Canton\r\n\r\nThe most important waterway system in South China is the Canton system.\r\nBesides this the others are not of much importance and will be dealt\r\nwith elsewhere with their ports. In dealing with the Canton system of\r\nwaterways, I have to divide it as follows:\r\n\r\n  a. The Canton Delta.\r\n  b. The West River.\r\n  c. The North River.\r\n  d. The East River.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Canton Delta\r\n\r\nTo improve the Canton Delta we have to consider the proposition from\r\nthree points of view: First, the problem of flood prevention; second,\r\nthe problem of navigation; and third, the problem of reclamation. Each\r\nof these problems affects the others so the solution of one will help\r\nthat of the others.\r\n\r\nFirst, the problem of flood prevention. The frequent repetition of\r\nfloods in recent years has wrought great disasters to the people in the\r\nneighborhood of Canton. It has destroyed lives by the thousands and\r\nproperty by the millions. The part which suffers most is the country\r\nbetween Canton and Lupao, lying just immediately north of the Canton\r\nDelta. This fatal spot is, I think, created by the silting up of the\r\nmain outlet of the North River immediately below Sainam. On account of\r\nthis, the North River has to find its outlets through the West River\r\nby the short canal at Samshui and through two small streams one from\r\nSainam, and another from Lupao. The former runs in a northeasterly\r\ndirection and the latter in a southeasterly direction and they join\r\nat Kuanyao. From this point, the river takes a northeasterly course\r\nas far as Kumli, thence, turning southeast, passes the west suburb of\r\nCanton. Since the North River is silted up below Sainam, its channel\r\nabove that spot is also getting shallower every year. At present the\r\nriver above Samshui city is only about four or five feet deep. When the\r\nNorth River rises its water generally finds its way into the West River\r\nthrough the Kongkun Canal. But if the West River should rise at the\r\nsame time, then there would be no outlet for the North River and its\r\nwater would accumulate until it overflowed its dikes above and below\r\nLupao. This would naturally cause the dikes to break at some point and\r\nallow the water to rush out and flood the whole country that is meant\r\nto be protected by these dikes. The remedy for the North River is to\r\nreopen the main outlet below Sainam and have the whole channel dredged\r\ndeep from Tsingyuen to the sea. Fortunately, in our improvement of the\r\nnavigation of the Canton Delta, we have to do the same thing; so this\r\none work will serve two purposes.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for the West River is that the shallow part just at its\r\njunction with the sea between Wangkum and Sanchoo Islands should be\r\ntrained by walls on both sides--a long one on the left, and a short\r\none on the right--so as to concentrate the current to cut the river\r\nbed here to a depth of twenty feet or more. In this way, a uniform\r\ndepth is secured, for after passing the Moto Entrance the West River\r\nhas an average depth of 20 to 30 feet right along its whole course\r\nthrough this delta. With a uniform depth all the way to the sea, the\r\nundercurrent will run quickly and drain off the flood water more\r\nrapidly. Besides the deepening process, both shores should be regulated\r\nso as to give a uniform width to the channel. Midstream shoals and\r\nislands should be removed.\r\n\r\nThe East River Valley does not suffer so severely from floods as those\r\nof the other two rivers, the West and the North, and its remedy will be\r\nprovided in the regulation of the river for navigation. This will be\r\ndealt with in that connection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP XV]\r\n\r\nSecond, the problem of navigation in the Canton Delta in connection\r\nwith the three rivers. In dealing with this question we commence with\r\nthe West River. In former days the traffic between the West River\r\nValley and Canton always passed through Fatshan and Samshui, a distance\r\nof about 35 miles. But since the silting up of the Fatshan Channel\r\nbelow Sainam, the traffic has to take a great detour by descending\r\nthe Pearl River southeastward as far as Fumen, then turn northwest\r\ninto the Shawan Channel, then southeast into the Tamchow Channel,\r\nand then west into the Tailiang Channel and south into the Junction\r\nChannel and Maning Reach. Here it enters into the West River and runs\r\na northwesterly direction up to Samshui Junction on this river. The\r\nwhole journey covers a distance of about 95 miles, which compared with\r\nthe old route is longer by 60 miles. The traffic between Canton and the\r\nWest River Valley is very great. At present there are many thousands of\r\nsteam launches plying between Canton City and the outlying districts,\r\nand more than half of that number are carrying traffic to and fro on\r\nthe West River. Every boat has to run 95 miles on each trip whereas if\r\nthe channel between Samshui and Canton is improved, the distance would\r\nbe only 35 miles. What a great saving it will be!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP XVI]\r\n\r\nIn our project to improve the Canton Approach and Harbor, I suggested\r\nthe draining of a deep channel from the sea to Whampoa and from Whampoa\r\nto Tamchow Channel. We now have to prolong this channel from its\r\nTamchow Junction up to Samshui Junction on the West River. This Channel\r\nshould be made at least 20 feet deep so as to join the deeper water of\r\nthe West River above the Samshui Junction. And the same depth should be\r\nmaintained in the North River itself some distance above Samshui, so as\r\nto give facility for the navigation of larger vessels up the river when\r\nthe whole waterway is improved.\r\n\r\nTo improve the East River for navigation in the Canton Delta we should\r\nconcentrate the current of its estuaries into one single outlet by\r\nusing the right channel which joins the Pearl River at Davids Island,\r\nthus deepening the channel as well as shortening the distance between\r\nCanton and the East River districts when the upper part of the river is\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement in the Canton Delta for navigation is the opening\r\nof a straight canal between Canton City and Kongmoon so as to shorten\r\nthe passage of the heavy traffic between this metropolis and the Szeyap\r\ndistricts. This canal should begin by straightening the Chanchun Creek\r\nsouth of Canton as far as Tsznai. Then crossing the Tamchow Channel it\r\nshould enter into the Shuntuck Creek and follow this creek to its end\r\nemerging into the Shuntuck Branch at right angles. From there, a new\r\ncanal must be cut straight to the turn of the Tailiang Channel near\r\nYungki, then the canal should follow this channel through Yellow Reach\r\nas far as the Junction Bend. Here another new canal must be cut through\r\nto the Hoichow Creek, then it should follow Kuchan Channel to the main\r\nchannel of the West River, and crossing it enter into the Kongmoon\r\nBranch. Thus, a straight canal can be formed between Canton and\r\nKongmoon. In order to understand the improvement of the Canton Delta\r\nmore clearly see Maps XIV and XV.\r\n\r\nThird, the problem of reclamation. A very profitable undertaking in\r\nthe Canton Delta is the reclamation of new land. This process has\r\nbeen going on for centuries. Many thousands of acres of new land are\r\nthus being added to cultivation from year to year. But hitherto all\r\nthe reclamation has been effected by private enterprise only, and\r\nthere are no regulations for it. So sometimes this private enterprise\r\ncauses great detriment to public welfare such as blocking up navigable\r\nchannels and causing floods. A glaring case is the reclamation work\r\njust above the Moto Islands, which blocks more than half of the Main\r\nChannel of the West River. In the regulation of the West River, I\r\npropose to cut this new land away. In order to protect the public\r\nwelfare, the reclamation work in this Delta must be taken up by the\r\nState and the profits must go to defray the expenses of improving\r\nthis waterway system for navigation, as well as for the prevention of\r\nfloods. At present, the area that can be gradually reclaimed is large\r\nin extent. On the left side of the Canton Estuary, the available area\r\nis about 40 square miles, and on the right side, about 140 square\r\nmiles. On the estuaries of the West River from Macao to Tongkwa Island,\r\nthere is an available area of about 200 square miles. Of the 380 square\r\nmiles, about one fourth would be ready for reclamation within the next\r\nten years. That is to say about 95 square miles could be reclaimed and\r\nput to cultivation within a decade. As one square mile contains 640\r\nacres and one acre six mow, so 95 square miles will be equal to 364,800\r\nmow. As cultivated land in this part of China generally costs more than\r\nfifty dollars a mow, so, if fifty dollars be taken as the average rate,\r\nthe value of these 364,800 mow would amount to $18,240,000. This will\r\nhelp a great deal to defray the expenses of improving the waterway for\r\nnavigation and for preventing floods in this Delta.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The West River\r\n\r\nThe West River is at present navigable for comparatively large river\r\nsteamers up to Wuchow, a distance of 220 miles by water from Canton,\r\nand for small steamers up to Nanning, a distance of 500 miles from\r\nCanton, at all seasons. As for small crafts, the West River is\r\nnavigable in most of its branches, west to the Yunnan frontier, north\r\nto Kweichow, northeast to Hunan and the Yangtze Valley by the Shingan\r\nCanal.\r\n\r\nIn improving the West River for navigation I shall divide the work into\r\nsubsections as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) From Samshui to Wuchow.\r\n\r\n    (2) From Wuchow to the junction of the Liukiang.\r\n\r\n    (3) Kweikiang or the North Branch of the West River from Wuchow\r\n        to Kweilin and beyond.\r\n\r\n    (4) The South Branch from Shunchow to Nanning.\r\n\r\n(1) From Samshui to Wuchow. This part of the West River is generally\r\ndeep and does not need much improvement for vessels up to ten-foot\r\ndraught excepting at a few points. The midstream rocks should be\r\nblasted and removed and sand banks and dilating parts should be\r\nregulated by submerged dikes to secure a uniform channel and to make\r\nthe velocity of the current even, so that a stable fairway could be\r\nmaintained all the year round. The traffic of this river would be\r\nsufficiently great to pay for all the improvements which we propose to\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n(2) From Wuchow to the Junction of the Liukiang. At this junction, a\r\nriver port should be built to connect the deep navigation from the sea\r\nand the shallow navigation of Hungshui Kiang and the Liukiang which\r\npenetrate the rich mineral districts of Northwest Kwangsi and Southwest\r\nKweichow. This port will be about fifty miles from Shunchow which is\r\nthe junction of the Nanning branch of the river. So here, we have\r\nonly to improve a distance of fifty miles, for the improvement of the\r\nriver between Shunchow and Wuchow will be included in the plan for the\r\nNanning Port. Dams and locks would be necessary to make this part of\r\nthe river navigable for ten-foot draught vessels. But these dams at the\r\nsame time would serve the purpose of producing water power.\r\n\r\n(3) Kweikiang or the North Branch of the West River from Wuchow to\r\nKweilin and beyond. As Kweikiang is smaller, shallower and has more\r\nrapids along its course, so its improvement will be more difficult\r\nthan that of the other parts of the waterway. But this will be a\r\nvery profitable proposition in this Southern waterway project, for\r\nthis river not only serves the purpose of transportation in this\r\nrich territory but will also serve as a passage for through traffic\r\nbetween the Yangtze and the West River valleys. The improvement should\r\ncommence from the junction at Wuchow up to Kweilin, and thence upward\r\nto the Shingan Canal, then downward to the Siang River, and thereby\r\nconnecting with the Yangtze River. A series of dams and locks should be\r\nbuilt for vessels to ascend to the inter-watershed canal and another\r\nseries should descend on the other side. The expenses of building these\r\ntwo series of dams and locks could not be estimated until accurate\r\nsurveys are made. But I am sure this project will be a paying one.\r\n\r\n(4) From Shunchow to Nanning. This portion of the Yuhkiang is navigable\r\nfor small steamers up to Nanning, the center of commerce in South\r\nKwangsi. From Nanning small crafts can navigate through the Yuhkiang as\r\nfar as the east border of Yunnan, and through Tsokiang as far as the\r\nnorth border of Tongking. If this waterway be improved up to Nanning,\r\nthen it would be the nearest deep river port for the rich mineral\r\ndistricts of the whole southwest corner of China, which includes the\r\nwhole province of Yunnan, a greater part of Kweichow and half of\r\nKwangsi. The immediate neighborhood of Nanning is also very rich in\r\nminerals, such as antimony, tin, iron, coal and also in agricultural\r\nproducts. So to make Nanning the head of a deep water communication\r\nsystem will be a paying proposition. To improve the waterway up to\r\nNanning, a few dams and locks along its course will have to be built\r\nfor vessels of ten-foot draught to go up as well as for water power.\r\nThe expense for this work cannot be estimated without detailed surveys\r\nbut it would probably be much less than the improvement of Kweikiang\r\nfrom Wuchow to the Shingan Canal.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The North River\r\n\r\nThe North River from Samshui to Shiuchow is about 140 miles long. The\r\ngreater part of its course is confined in the hilly districts, but\r\nafter it emerges from the Tsingyuen Gorge it comes into a wide, open\r\ncountry, which connects with the plain of Canton. Here the dangerous\r\nfloods occur most often. Since the silting up of its proper outlet\r\nbelow Sainam, the North River from that point up to the gorge has\r\nbecome shallower every year, so the dikes at the left side, that is,\r\non the side of the plain, often break thus causing the inundation of\r\nthe whole plain above Canton. Thus the regulation of the river at this\r\npart has two aspects to be considered: First, the prevention of floods\r\nand second, the improvement for navigation. In dealing with the first\r\naspect nothing could be better than deepening the river by dredging.\r\nIn the improvement of the Canton Approach and Harbor and also of the\r\nCanton Delta, we have to cut a deep channel right from the deep sea up\r\nto Sainam. In the improvement of the lower part of the North River, we\r\nhave simply to continue the cutting process higher up until we have a\r\ndeep channel, say 15 to 20 feet as far as the Tsingyuen Gorge, either\r\nby artificial or natural means. By this deepening of the bottom of the\r\nriver, the present height of the dikes will be quite enough to protect\r\nthe plains from being flooded.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the second aspect, as we have already deepened the part\r\nof the river from Sainam to the Tsingyuen Gorge for flood prevention,\r\nwe have at the same time solved the navigation question. It has now\r\nonly the upper part to be dealt with. I propose to make this river\r\nnavigable up to Shiuchow, the center of commerce as well as the center\r\nof the coal and iron fields of Northern Kwangtung. To improve the part\r\nabove the gorge for navigation, dams and locks should be built in one\r\nor two places before a ten-foot draught vessel can ascend up to that\r\npoint. Although this river is parallel with the Hankow-Canton Railway,\r\nyet if the coal and iron fields of Shiuchow are properly developed, a\r\ndeep waterway will still be needed for cheap transportation of such\r\nheavy freight as iron and coal to the coast. So to build dams for\r\nwater power and to construct locks for navigation in this river will\r\nbe a profitable undertaking as well as a necessary condition for the\r\ndevelopment of this part of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The East River\r\n\r\nThe East River is navigable for shallow crafts up to Laolung Sze, a\r\ndistance of about 170 miles from the estuary at the lower point of\r\nDavids Island near Whampoa. Along its upper course, rich iron and coal\r\ndeposits are found. Iron has been mined here since time immemorial. At\r\npresent most of the utensils used in this province are manufactured\r\nfrom the iron mined. So to make a deep navigable waterway up to these\r\niron and coal fields will be most remunerative.\r\n\r\nTo improve the East River for navigation as well as for flood\r\nprevention, I propose to start the work at the lower point of Davids\r\nIsland as stated in the improvement of the Canton Approach. From here,\r\na deep channel should be dredged up to Suntang, and a mile above that\r\npoint a new channel should be opened in the direction of Tungkun city,\r\nby connecting the various arms of water between these two places and\r\njoining the left branch of the East River immediately above Tungkun\r\ncity. All other channels leading from this new channel to the Pearl\r\nRiver should be closed up to normal water level so as to make these\r\nclosed-up channels serve as flood outlets in rainy seasons. Thus by\r\nblocking up the rest of the estuaries of the East River, all the water\r\nwould form one strong current which would dredge the river bottom\r\ndeeper, and maintain the depth permanently. The body of the river\r\nshould be trained to a uniform width right along its course up to tidal\r\npoint, and above this point, the river should be narrowed in proportion\r\nto its volume of water. Thus the whole river would dredge itself deep\r\nfar up above Waichow city. The railway bridge at the south side of\r\nShelung should be made a turning bridge so as to permit large steamers\r\nto pass through it. Some sharp turns of the river should be reduced to\r\ngentle curves and midstream obstacles should be removed. The portion of\r\nthe river above Waichow should be provided with dams and locks so as\r\nto enable ten-foot draught vessels to ascend as near as possible to the\r\niron and coal fields in the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nThe Construction of the Southwestern Railway System of China\r\n\r\nThe southwestern part of China comprises Szechwan, the largest and\r\nrichest province of China Proper, Yunnan, the second largest province,\r\nKwangsi and Kweichow which are rich in mineral resources, and a part\r\nof Hunan and Kwangtung. It has an area of 600,000 square miles, and a\r\npopulation of over 100,000,000. This large and populous part of China\r\nis almost untouched by railways, except a French line of narrow gauge\r\nfrom Laokay to Yunnanfu, covering a distance of 290 miles.\r\n\r\nThere are great possibilities for railway development in this part of\r\nthe country. A network of lines should radiate fan-like from Canton\r\nas pivot to connect every important city and rich mineral field with\r\nthe Great Southern Port. The construction of railways in this part\r\nof China is not only needed for the development of Canton but also\r\nis essential for the prosperity of all the southwestern provinces.\r\nWith the construction of railways rich mines of various kinds could\r\nbe developed and cities and towns could be built along the lines.\r\nDeveloped lands are still very cheap and undeveloped lands and those\r\nwith mining possibilities cost almost next to nothing even though\r\nnot state owned. So if all the future city sites and mining lands be\r\ntaken up by the government before railway construction is started, the\r\nprofit would be enormous. Thus no matter how large a sum is invested in\r\nrailway construction, the payment of its interest and principal will be\r\nassured. Besides, the development of Canton as a world port is entirely\r\ndependent upon this system of railways. If there be no such network of\r\nrailway traversing the length and breadth of the southwestern section\r\nof China, Canton could not be developed up to our expectations.\r\n\r\nThe southwestern section of China is very mountainous, except the\r\nCanton and Chengtu plains, which have an area of from 3,000 to 4,000\r\nsquare miles each. The rest of the country is made up almost entirely\r\nof hills and valleys with more or less open space here and there.\r\nThe mountains in the eastern part of this section are seldom over\r\n3,000 feet high but those near the Tibetan frontier generally have\r\nan altitude of 10,000 feet or more. The engineering difficulties in\r\nbuilding these railways are much greater than those of the northwestern\r\nplain. Many tunnels and loops will have to be constructed and so the\r\nconstruction costs of the railway per mile will be greater than in\r\nother parts of China.\r\n\r\nWith Canton as the terminus of this system of railroads, I propose that\r\nthe following lines be constructed:\r\n\r\n    a. The Canton-Chungking line via Hunan.\r\n\r\n    b. The Canton-Chungking line via Hunan and Kweichow.\r\n\r\n    c. The Canton-Chengtu line via Kweilin and Luchow.\r\n\r\n    d. The Canton-Chengtu line via Wuchow and Suifu.\r\n\r\n    e. The Canton-Yunnanfu-Tali-Tengyueh line ending at the Burma\r\n       border.\r\n\r\n    f. The Canton-Szemao line.\r\n\r\n    g. The Canton-Yamchow line ending at Tunghing, on the Annam\r\n       border.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Canton-Chungking Line via Hunan\r\n\r\nThis line will start from Canton and follow the same direction as the\r\nCanton-Hankow line as far as the junction of the Linkiang with the\r\nNorth River. From that point the railroad turns into the valley of\r\nLinkiang, and follows the course of the river upward above the city\r\nof Linchow. There it crosses the watershed between the Linkiang and\r\nthe Taokiang and proceeds to Taochow, Hunan. Thence it follows the\r\nTaokiang to Yungchow, Paoking, Sinhwa, and Shenchow, and up to Peiho\r\nacross the boundary of Hunan into Szechwan by Yuyang. From Yuyang the\r\nline proceeds across the mountain to Nanchuen, thence to Chungking\r\nafter crossing the Yangtze. This railway which has a total length of\r\nabout 900 miles passes through a rich mineral and agricultural country.\r\nIn the Linchow district north of Kwangtung, rich coal, antimony, and\r\nwolfram deposits are found; in southwestern Hunan, tin, antimony, coal,\r\niron, copper and silver; and at Yuyang, east of Szechwan, antimony and\r\nquicksilver. Among agricultural products found along this line we may\r\nmention sugar, groundnuts, hemp, tung oil, tea, cotton, tobacco, silk,\r\ngrains, etc. There is also an abundance of timber, bamboo and various\r\nkinds of forest products.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Canton-Chungking Line via Hunan and Kweichow\r\n\r\nThis line is about 800 miles in length, but as it runs in the same\r\ntrack with line (a) from Canton to Taochow, a distance of about 250\r\nmiles, it leaves only 550 miles to be accounted for. This line,\r\ntherefore, actually begins at Taochow, Hunan, and goes through the\r\nnortheastern corner of Kwangsi passing by Chuanchow, and then through\r\nthe southwestern corner of Hunan passing by Chengpu and Tsingchow.\r\nThence it enters into Kweichow by Sankiang and Tsingkiang and crosses\r\na range of hill to Chengyuan. From Chengyuan this line has to cross\r\nthe watershed between Yuan Kiang and Wukiang to Tsunyi. From Tsunyi it\r\nwill follow the trade route which leads to Kikiang and then crosses the\r\nYangtze by the same bridge as line (a) to Chungking. This railway will\r\nalso pass through rich mineral and timber districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The Canton-Chengtu Line via Kweilin and Luchow\r\n\r\nThis line is about 1,000 miles long. It runs from Canton directly west\r\nto Samshui, where it crosses the North River to the mouth of Suikong.\r\nThen, it ascends the valley of the same name to Szewui and Kwongning.\r\nNext, it enters into Kwangsi at Waisap, thence to Hohsien and Pinglo.\r\nFrom there it follows the course of the Kweikiang up to Kweilin. Thus\r\nthe rich iron and coal fields that lie between these two provincial\r\ncapitals, Canton and Kweilin, will be tapped. From Kweilin the road\r\nturns west to Yungning and then proceeds to follow the Liukiang valley\r\ninto Kweichow province at Kuchow. From Kuchow it goes to Tukiang and\r\nPachai and following the same valley it crosses a range of hills into\r\nPingyueh, thence it goes across the Yuankiang watershed into the\r\nWukiang valley at Wengan and Yosejen. From Yosejen it follows the\r\ntrade route through Luipien hills to Jenhwai, Chishui, and Nachi. Then\r\nit crosses the Yangtzekiang to Luchow. From Luchow, it runs through\r\nLungchang, Neikiang, Tzechow, Tseyang and Kienchow to Chengtu. The last\r\npart of the line traverses very rich and populous districts of the\r\nfamous Red Basin of Szechwan province. The middle portion of this line\r\nbetween Kweilin and Luchow lies in a very rich mineral country which\r\npossesses great possibilities for further development. This line will\r\nopen up a thinly populated part for the crowded districts at both ends\r\nof the line.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The Canton-Chengtu Line via Wuchow and Suifu\r\n\r\nThis line is about 1,200 miles in distance. It commences at the west\r\nend of the Samshui bridge which crosses the North River at that point\r\nfor line (c), and following the left bank of the West River enters the\r\nShiuhing Gorge to the Shiuhing city. It passes Takhing, Wuchow, and\r\nTahwang along the same bank. While the river here turns southwestwards\r\nthe line turns northwestwards to Siangchow and then crosses Liukiang\r\nto Liuchow and Kingyuan. Then it goes to Szegenhsien and across the\r\nKwangsi and Kweichow border to Tushan and Tuyun. From Tuyun the line\r\nturns more westerly to Kweiyang, the capital of Kweichow Province.\r\nNext, it proceeds to Kiensi and Tating and then leaving the Kweichow\r\nborder at Pichieh it enters Yunnan at Chenhiung. Turning northward to\r\nLohsintu and crossing the Szechwan border at that point, it proceeds to\r\nSuifu. From Suifu the road follows the course of the Minkiang, passes\r\nby Kiating and enters the Chengtu plain to Chengtu, the capital of\r\nSzechwan. This line runs from one densely populated district to another\r\nand passes through a wide strip of thinly populated and undeveloped\r\ncountry in the middle. Along its course many rich iron and coal fields,\r\nsilver, tin, antimony, and other valuable metal deposits are found.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. The Canton-Yunnanfu-Tali-Tengyueh Line\r\n\r\nThis line is about 1,300 miles in length from Canton to the Burma\r\nborder at Tengyueh. The first 300 miles of the line from Canton to\r\nTahwang will be the same as line (d). From the Tahwang junction this\r\nline branches off to Wusuan and following in a general way the course\r\nof the Hungshui Kiang passes through Tsienkiang and Tunglan. Then it\r\ncuts across the southwestern corner of Kweichow province passing by\r\nSinyihsien and thence enters Yunnan province at Loping and by way\r\nof Luliang to Yunnanfu, the capital of the province. From Yunnanfu\r\nthis line runs through Tsuyung to Tali, then turns southwestwards to\r\nYungchang and Tengyueh ending at the Burma border.\r\n\r\nAt Tunglan, near the Kweichow border in Kwangsi, a branch line of about\r\n400 miles should be projected. This line should follow the Pepan Kiang\r\nvalley, up to Kotuho, and Weining. Thence it enters Yunnan at Chaotung,\r\nand crosses the Yangtze River at Hokeow, where it enters Szechwan.\r\nCrossing the Taliang mountain, it goes to Ningyuan. This branch line\r\ntaps the famous copper field between Chaotung and Ningyuan, the richest\r\nof its kind in China.\r\n\r\nThe main line running through the length of Kwangsi and Yunnan from\r\neast to west, will be of international importance, for at the frontier\r\nit will join the Rangoon Bhamo line of the Burmese Railway System. It\r\nwill be the shortest road from India to China. It will bring the two\r\npopulous countries nearer to each other than now. By the new way the\r\njourney can be made in a few days, whereas by the present sea-route it\r\ntakes as many weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. The Canton-Szemao Line\r\n\r\nThis line to the border of Burma is about 1,100 miles long. It starts\r\nfrom south of Canton, passes Fatshan, Kunshan, and crosses the West\r\nRiver from Taipinghü to Samchowhü. Thence it proceeds to Koming,\r\nSinhing, and Loting. After passing Loting it crosses the Kwangsi border\r\nat Pingho, and proceeds to Junghsien and then westward, crossing the\r\nYukiang branch of the West River, to Kweihsien. Thence it runs north\r\nof Yukiang to Nanning. At Nanning a branch line of 120 miles should be\r\nprojected. Following the course of the Tsokiang it goes to Lungchow\r\nwhere it turns southward to Chennankwan on the Tongking border to join\r\nthe French line at that point. The main line from Nanning proceeds in\r\nthe same course as the upper Yukiang to Poseh. Then it crosses the\r\nborder into Yunnan at Poyai, and by way of Pamen, Koukan, Tungtu and\r\nPutsitang to Amichow, where it crosses the French Laokay-Yunnan line.\r\nFrom Amichow it proceeds to Linanfu, Shihping and Yuankiang where it\r\ncrosses the river of the same name. Thence it passes through Talang,\r\nPuerhfu and Szemao and finally ends at the border of Burma near the\r\nMekong River. This line taps the rich tin, silver, and antimony\r\ndeposits of south Yunnan and Kwangsi, while rich iron and coal fields\r\nare found right along the whole line. Gold, copper, mercury, and lead\r\nare also found in many places. As regards agricultural products, rice\r\nand groundnuts are found in great abundance, also camphor, cassia,\r\nsugar, tobacco, and various kinds of fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\ng. The Canton-Yamchow Line\r\n\r\nThis line is about 400 miles long measuring from the west end of the\r\nSikiang bridge. Starting from Canton it runs on the tracks of line (f)\r\nas far as the farther side of the bridge over the West River. Thence\r\nit branches off to the southwest to Hoiping and Yanping, and by way of\r\nYeungchun to Kochow and Fachow. At Fachow, a branch line of 100 miles\r\nshould be projected to Suikai, Luichow and Haian on the Hainan Straits\r\nwhere, by means of a ferry, it connects with Hainan Island. The main\r\nline continues from Fachow westward to Sheshing, Limchow, Yamchow and\r\nends on the Annam border at Tunghing, where it may connect with a\r\nFrench line to Haiphong. This line is entirely within the Kwangtung\r\nprovince. It passes through a very populous and productive country.\r\nCoal and iron are found along the whole line, while gold and antimony,\r\nin some parts. Agricultural products, as sugar, silk, camphor, ramie,\r\nindigo, groundnuts, and various kinds of fruits are raised here.\r\n\r\nThe total length of this system as outlined above is about 6,700 miles.\r\nIn addition there will be two connecting lines between Chengtu and\r\nChungking; another from east of Tsunyi on line (b) southward to Wengan\r\non line (c); another from Pingyueh on line (c) to Tuyun on line (d);\r\nanother from the border of Kweichow on line (d) through Nantan and\r\nNoti to Tunglan on line (e), thence through Szecheng to Poseh on line\r\n(f). These connecting lines total about 600 miles. So the grand total\r\nwill be about 7,300 miles.\r\n\r\nThis system will be intersected by three lines. First, the existing\r\nFrench line from Laokay to Yunnanfu with a projected line from Yunnanfu\r\nto Chungking crosses line (f) at Amichow, line (e) at Weining, line (d)\r\nat Suifu, line (c) at Luchow, and meets lines (a) and (b) at Chungking.\r\nSecond, the projected British line from Shasi to Sinyi crosses line (a)\r\nat Shenchow, line (b) at Chenyuen, line (c) at Pingyueh, line (d) at\r\nKweiyang and a branch of line (e) at a point west of Yungning. Third,\r\nthe projected American line from Chuchow to Yamchow crosses line (a)\r\nat Yungchow, line (b) at Chuanchow, line (c) at Kweilin, line (d) at\r\nLiuchow, line (e) at Tsienkiang, line (f) at Nanning, and meets line\r\n(g) at Yamchow. Thus, if this system and the three projected French,\r\nBritish, and American lines are completed, Southwestern China would be\r\nwell provided with railway communications.\r\n\r\nAll these lines will run through the length and breadth of a vast\r\nmineral country, in which most of the essential and valuable metals of\r\nthe world are found. There is no place in the world which possesses as\r\nhere so many varieties of rare metals, such as wolfram, tin, antimony,\r\nsilver, gold, and platinum and at the same time so richly provided\r\nwith the common but essential metals, such as copper, lead, and iron.\r\nFurthermore, almost every district in this region is abundantly\r\nprovided with coal, so much so that there is a common saying: \"Mu mei\r\npu lih cheng,\" that is, \"Nobody would build a city where there is no\r\ncoal underneath.\" The idea was that in case of a siege those within the\r\ncity might obtain fuel from under the ground. In Szechwan, petroleum\r\nand natural gas are also found in abundance.\r\n\r\nThus, we see that this Southwestern Railway System for the development\r\nof mineral resources in the mountainous regions of Southwestern China\r\nis just as important as the Northwestern Railway System is for the\r\ndevelopment of agricultural resources in the vast prairies of Mongolia\r\nand Turkestan. These railway systems are a necessity to the Chinese\r\npeople and a very profitable undertaking to foreign capitalists.\r\nThey are of about equal length, viz.--about 7,000 miles. The cost\r\nper mile of the Southwestern System will be at least twice that of\r\nthe Northwestern System, but the remuneration from the development\r\nof mineral resources will be many times that from the development of\r\nagricultural resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nThe Construction of Coast Ports and Fishing Harbors\r\n\r\nAfter planning the three world ports on the coast of China, it is time\r\nfor me to go on and deal with the development of second-and third-class\r\nseaports and fishing harbors along the whole coast in order to\r\ncomplete a system of seaports for China. Recently, my projected plan of\r\nthe Great Northern Port was so enthusiastically received by the people\r\nof Chili Province that the Provincial Assembly has approved the project\r\nand decided to carry it out at once as a provincial undertaking.\r\nFor this object, a loan of $40,000,000 has been voted. This is an\r\nencouraging sign and doubtless the other projects will be taken up\r\nsooner or later by either the provinces or the Central Government,\r\nwhen the people begin to realize their necessity. I propose that four\r\nsecond-class seaports and nine third-class seaports and numerous\r\nfishing harbors should be constructed.\r\n\r\nThe four second-class seaports will be arranged so as to be placed in\r\nthe following manner: one on the extreme north, one on the extreme\r\nsouth, and the other two midway between the three great world ports.\r\n\r\nI shall deal with them according to the order of their future\r\nimportance as follows:\r\n\r\n  a. Yingkow.\r\n  b. Haichow.\r\n  c. Foochow.\r\n  d. Yamchow.\r\n\r\n\r\na. Yingkow\r\n\r\nYingkow is situated at the head of the Liaotung Gulf and was once\r\nthe only seaport of Manchuria. Since the improvement of Talien as a\r\nseaport, the trade of Yingkow has dwindled and lost half of its former\r\nbusiness. As a seaport, Yingkow has two disadvantages, first, the\r\nshallowness of its approach from the sea and second, the blocking up\r\nby ice for several months in winter. Its only advantages over Talien\r\nis that it is situated at the mouth of the Liaoho and has inland\r\nwater communication throughout the Liao valley in south Manchuria.\r\nThe half of the former trade that it still holds at present against\r\nTalien is entirely due to the inland water facility. To make Yingkow\r\noutmatch Talien again in the future and become first in importance\r\nafter the three great world ports, we must improve its inland water\r\ncommunication, as well as deepen its approach from the sea. In regard\r\nto the improvement of the approach work similar to the improvement of\r\nthe Canton Approach should be adopted. Besides the construction of a\r\ndeep channel, about twenty feet in depth, reclamation work should be\r\ncarried out at the same time. For, the shallow and extensive swamp\r\nat the head of the Liaotung Gulf could be turned into rice-producing\r\nland from which great profit could be derived. Regarding the inland\r\nwater communication, not only the water system in the Liao valley but\r\nalso the Sungari and the Amur Systems have to be improved. The most\r\nimportant work is the construction of a canal to connect these systems\r\nand this I shall now discuss in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Liaoho-Sungari Canal is the most important factor in the future\r\nprosperity of Yingkow. It is by this canal only that this port can\r\nbe made the most important of the second-class seaports in China and\r\nfurther the vast forest lands, the virgin soil and the rich mineral\r\nresources of North Manchuria can be connected by water communication\r\nwith Yingkow. So this canal is all important for Yingkow, without which\r\nYingkow as a seaport could at most hold her present position, a town\r\nof 60,000 to 70,000 inhabitants and an annual trade of $30,000,000\r\nto $40,000,000 only and could never gain a place as the first of the\r\nsecond-class seaports in China. This canal can be cut either south of\r\nHwaiteh in a line parallel to the South Manchurian Railway between\r\nFan Kia Tun and Sze Tung Shan, a distance of less than ten miles, or\r\nnorth of Hwaiteh in a line between Tsing-shan-pao and Kaw-shan-tun,\r\na distance of about fifteen miles. In the former case the canal is\r\nshorter but it makes the waterway as a whole longer, while in the\r\nlatter case, the canal is about twice as long but it makes the waterway\r\nas a whole shorter between the two systems. In either line, there are\r\nno impassable physical obstacles. Both lines are on the plain but the\r\nelevation of the one may be higher than that of the other, which is the\r\nonly factor that will determine the choice between the two. If this\r\ncanal is constructed, then the rich provinces of Kirin and Heilungkiang\r\nand a portion of Outer Mongolia will be brought within direct water\r\ncommunication with China Proper. At present, all water traffic has to\r\ngo by way of the Russian Lower Amur, then round a great detour of the\r\nJapan Sea before reaching China Proper. This canal will not only be\r\na great necessity to Yingkow as a seaport, but will also have a great\r\nbearing on the whole Chinese nation economically and politically. With\r\nthe Liaoho-Sungari Canal completed Yingkow will be the grand terminus\r\nof the inland waterway system of all Manchuria and Northeastern\r\nMongolia; and with the approach from the sea deepened it will also be a\r\nseaport next in importance only to the three first-class world ports.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. Haichow\r\n\r\nHaichow is situated on the eastern edge of the central plain of China.\r\nThis plain is one of the most extensive and fertile areas on earth. As\r\na seaport, Haichow is midway between the two great world ports along\r\nthe coast line, namely the Great Northern and the Great Eastern Ports.\r\nIt has been made as the terminus of the Hailan railway, the trunk line\r\nof central China from east to west. Haichow also possesses the facility\r\nof inland water communication. If the Grand Canal and the other\r\nwaterway systems are improved, it will be connected with the Hoangho\r\nValley in North China, the Yangtze Valley in Central China, and the\r\nSikiang Valley in South China. Its deep sea approach is comparatively\r\ngood, being the only spot along the 250 miles of the North Kiangsu\r\ncoast that could be reached by ocean steamers to within a few miles\r\nof the shore. To make Haichow a seaport for 20 feet draught vessels,\r\nthe approach has to be dredged for many miles from the mouth of the\r\nriver before the four fathom line could be reached. Although possessing\r\nbetter advantages than Yingkow, in being ice free, Haichow, as a\r\nsecond-class seaport, has to be content to take a second place after\r\nYingkow, because she does not have as vast a hinterland as Yingkow, nor\r\nsuch a monopolistic position in regard to inland water communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. Foochow\r\n\r\nFoochow, the capital of Fukien Province, ranks third among our\r\nsecond-class seaports. Foochow is already a very large city, its\r\ninhabitants being nearly a million. It is situated at the lower reach\r\nof the Min River, about 30 miles from the sea. The hinterland of\r\nthis port is confined to the Min Valley with an area of about 30,000\r\nsquare miles. The territory beyond this valley will be commanded by\r\nother coast or river ports, so the area commanded by this port is much\r\nsmaller than that by Haichow. Consequently, it could be given only\r\nthe third place in the category of second-class seaports. The Foochow\r\napproach from the Outer Bar to Kinpei Entrance is very shallow. After\r\nthis Entrance is passed, the river is confined on both sides by high\r\nhills and becomes narrow and deep right up to Pagoda Anchorage.\r\n\r\nI propose that a new port should be constructed at the lower part of\r\nNantai Island. For here land is cheap and there will be plenty of\r\nroom for modern improvement. A locked basin for shipping could be\r\nconstructed at the lower point of Nantai Island, just above Pagoda\r\nAnchorage. The left branch of the Min River above Foochow City should\r\nbe blocked up so as to concentrate the current to flush the harbor at\r\nthe south side of Nantai. The blocked-up channel on the north side of\r\nthat island should be left to be reclaimed by natural process or may\r\nbe used as a tidal basin to flush the channel below Pagoda Anchorage,\r\nif it is found necessary. The upper Min River must be improved as far\r\nas possible for inland water traffic. Its lower reach from Pagoda\r\nAnchorage to the sea must be trained and regulated to secure a through\r\nchannel of 30 feet or more to the open sea. Thus Foochow could also be\r\nmade a calling port for ocean liners that ply between the world ports.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. Yamchow\r\n\r\nYamchow is situated at the head of Tongking Gulf in the extreme south\r\nof the China Coast. This city is about 400 miles west of Canton--the\r\nGreat Southern Port. All the districts lying west of Yamchow will\r\nfind their way to the sea by this port 400 miles shorter than by\r\nCanton. As sea transportation is commonly known to be twenty times\r\ncheaper than rail transportation, the shortening of a distance of 400\r\nmiles to the sea means a great deal economically to the provinces of\r\nSzechuan, Yunnan, Kweichow, and a part of Kwangsi. Although Nanning, an\r\ninland water port, lying northwest of Yamchow, is much nearer to the\r\nhinterland than Yamchow, yet it could not serve this hinterland as a\r\nseaport. So all the direct import and export trade will find Yamchow\r\nthe cheapest shipping stage.\r\n\r\nTo improve Yamchow as a seaport the Lungmen River should be regulated\r\nin order to secure a deep channel to the city, and the estuary should\r\nbe deepened by dredging and training to provide a good approach to\r\nthe port. This port has been selected as the terminus of the Chuchow\r\nYamchow Railway (Chu-Kin line) which will run from Hunan through\r\nKwangsi into Kwangtung. Although the hinterland of this port is\r\nmuch larger than that of Foochow, yet I still rank it after that\r\ncity because the area commanded by it is also commanded by Canton,\r\nthe southern world port, and by Nanning, the river port, and so\r\nall internal as well as indirect import and export trade must go\r\nto the other two ports. It is only the direct foreign trade that\r\nwill use Yamchow. Thus, in spite of its extensive hinterland it is\r\nvery improbable that it could outmatch Foochow in the future as a\r\nsecond-class port.\r\n\r\nBesides the three great world ports, and the four second-class ports, I\r\npropose to construct nine third-class ports along the China coast, from\r\nnorth to south, as follows:\r\n\r\n  a. Hulutao.\r\n  b. Hoangho Port.\r\n  c. Chefoo.\r\n  d. Ningpo.\r\n  e. Wenchow.\r\n  f. Amoy.\r\n  g. Swatow.\r\n  h. Tienpak.\r\n  i. Hoihou.\r\n\r\n\r\na. Hulutao\r\n\r\nHulutao is an ice-free and deep-water port, situated on the west side\r\nof the head of Liaotung Gulf, about 60 miles from Yingkow. As a winter\r\nport for Manchuria, it is in a more advantageous position than Talien\r\nfor it is about 200 miles shorter by rail to the sea than the latter\r\nand is on the edge of a rich coal field. When this coal field and the\r\nsurrounding mineral resources are developed, Hulutao will become the\r\nfirst of the third-class ports and a good outlet for Jehol and Eastern\r\nMongolia. This port may be projected as an alternative to Yingkow,\r\nas the sole port of Manchuria and Eastern Mongolia, if a canal could\r\nbe constructed to connect it with the Liaoho. It is only by inland\r\nwater communication that Yingkow could be made the important port of\r\nManchuria in the future and it will be the same in the case of Hulutao.\r\nSo if inland water communication could be secured for Hulutao it will\r\nentirely displace Yingkow. If it is found to be economically cheaper\r\nin the long run to construct a Hulutao-Liaoho Canal than to construct\r\na deep harbor at Yingkow, the Hulutao harbor will have to be placed\r\non the northwest side of the peninsula instead of on the southwest as\r\nat present projected. For the present site has not enough room for\r\nanchorage without building an extensive breakwater into the deep sea,\r\nwhich will be a very expensive work. Furthermore, there would not be\r\nroom enough for city planning on the narrow peninsula, whereas on the\r\nother side, the city could be built on the mainland with unlimited\r\nspace for its development.\r\n\r\nI suggest that a sea wall be built from the northern point of\r\nLienshanwan to the northern point of Hulutao to close up the Lienshan\r\nBay and make it into a closed harbor, and an entrance be opened in\r\nthe neck of Hulutao to the south side where deep water is found. This\r\nclosed harbor will be over 10 square miles in extent but only some\r\nparts need to be dredged to the required depth at present. On the north\r\nside of the harbor, another entrance into the neighboring bay should be\r\nleft open between the sea wall and the shore, and another breakwater\r\nshould be built across the next bay. From there, a canal should be\r\nconstructed either by cutting into the shore or by building a wall\r\nparallel with the coast line until it reaches the lowland from where\r\na canal should be cut to connect with the Liaoho. If a canal is thus\r\nconstructed for Hulutao, then it will at once take the place of Yingkow\r\nand become the first of the second-class ports.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Hoangho Port\r\n\r\nThe Hoangho Port will be situated at the estuary of the Hoangho on the\r\nsouthern side of the Gulf of Pechihli, about 80 miles from our Great\r\nNorthern Port. When the Hoangho regulation is completed its estuary\r\nwill be approachable by ocean steamers, and a seaport will naturally\r\nspring up there. As it commands a considerable part of the northern\r\nplain in the provinces of Shantung, Chili, and Honan and possesses the\r\nfacility of inland water communication, this port is bound to become an\r\nimportant third-class port.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. Chefoo\r\n\r\nChefoo is an old treaty port situated on the northern side of the\r\nShantung Peninsula. Once it was the only ice-free port in the whole\r\nof North China. Since the development of Talien in the north and\r\nthe development of Tsingtau in the south its trade has dwindled\r\nconsiderably. As a seaport, it will undoubtedly hold its own when the\r\nrailroads in the Shantung Peninsula are developed, and the artificial\r\nharbor is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. Ningpo\r\n\r\nNingpo is also an old treaty port, situated on a small river, the\r\nYungkiang, in the eastern part of Chekiang province. It has a good\r\napproach, deep water reaching right up to the estuary of the river. The\r\nharbor can be easily improved by simply training and straightening two\r\nbends along its course up to the city. Ningpo commands a very small\r\nbut rich hinterland. Its people are very enterprising, and are famed\r\nfor their workmanship and handicrafts second only to those of Canton.\r\nThus Ningpo is bound to become a manufacturing city when China is\r\nindustrially developed. But owing to the proximity of the Great Eastern\r\nPort, Ningpo will not likely have much import and export trade directly\r\nwith foreign countries. Most of its trade will be carried on with the\r\nGreat Eastern Port. So a moderate harbor for local and coast-wise\r\ntraffic will be quite sufficient for Ningpo.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. Wenchow\r\n\r\nWenchow is situated near the mouth of the Wukiang in south Chekiang.\r\nThis seaport has a wider hinterland than Ningpo, its surrounding\r\ndistricts being very productive. If railroads are developed it will\r\nundoubtedly command considerable local trade. At present the harbor is\r\nvery shallow, unapproachable by even moderate-sized coastal steamers.\r\nI suggest that a new harbor at Panshiwei, north of Wenchow Island be\r\nconstructed. For this purpose, a dike should be built between the\r\nnorthern bank and the head of Wenchow Island to block up the river\r\nentirely on the northern side of that island leaving only a lock\r\nentrance. The Wukiang should be led through the channel on the south\r\nside of the island for the purpose of reclaiming the vast expanse of\r\nthe near-by shallows as well as for draining the upper stream. The\r\napproach from the southern side of Hutau Island to the port should be\r\ndredged. On the right side of the approach, a wall should be built in\r\nthe shallow between Wenchow Island and Miau Island and in the shallows\r\nbetween Miau Island and Sanpam Island so as to form a continuous wall\r\nto prevent the silt of Wukiang from entering into the approach. Thus a\r\npermanent deep channel will be secured for the new port of Wenchow.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. Amoy\r\n\r\nAmoy, an old treaty port, is situated on the island of Siming. It has\r\na great, deep, and fine harbor, commanding a considerable hinterland\r\nin southern Fukien and Kiangsi, very rich in coal and iron deposits.\r\nThis port carries on a busy trade with the Malay Archipelago and the\r\nSoutheastern Asian Peninsula. Most of the Chinese residents in the\r\nsouthern islands, Annam, Burma, Siam, and the Malay States are from the\r\nneighborhood of Amoy. So the passenger traffic between Amoy and the\r\nsouthern colonies is very great. If railways are developed to tap the\r\nrich iron and coal fields in the hinterland, Amoy is bound to develop\r\ninto a much larger seaport than it is at present. I suggest that a\r\nmodern port be constructed on the west side of the harbor to act as an\r\noutlet for the rich mineral fields of southern Fukien and Kiangsi. This\r\nport should be equipped with modern plants in order to connect land and\r\nsea transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\ng. Swatow\r\n\r\nSwatow is situated at the mouth of the Hankiang at the extreme east\r\nof Kwangtung. In relation to emigration, Swatow is much similar to\r\nAmoy, for it also supplies a great number of colonists to southeastern\r\nAsia and the Malay Archipelago. So its passenger traffic with the\r\nsouth is just as busy as Amoy. As a seaport Swatow is far inferior\r\nto Amoy, on account of its shallow approach. But in regard to inland\r\nwater communication, Swatow is in a better position as the Hankiang\r\nis navigable for many hundreds of miles inland by shallow crafts. The\r\ncountry around Swatow is very productive agriculturally, being second\r\nonly to the Canton Delta along the Southern seaboard. In the upper\r\nreaches of the Hankiang there are very rich iron and coal deposits.\r\nThe approach to the port of Swatow can be improved easily by a little\r\ntraining and dredging, thus making it a fine local port.\r\n\r\n\r\nh. Tienpak\r\n\r\nTienpak is situated at a point in the coast of Kwangtung province\r\nbetween the estuary of the West River and the island of Hainan. Its\r\nsurrounding districts are rich in agricultural products and mineral\r\ndeposits. So a shipping port in this part is quite necessary. Tienpak\r\ncan be made into a fine harbor by entirely walling in the bay from its\r\nwest side and by opening a new entrance into the deep water in the neck\r\nof the peninsula southeast of the bay. Thus a good approach could be\r\nsecured. The harbor is very wide but only a part need be dredged for\r\nlarge vessels and the rest of the space could be used by fishing boats\r\nand other shallow crafts.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. Hoihou\r\n\r\nHoihou is situated on the north side of Hainan Island on the strait\r\nof the same name, opposite Haian on the Luichow Peninsula. Hoihou is\r\na treaty port, similar to Amoy and Swatow, supplying a great number\r\nof colonists to the south; Hainan is a very rich but undeveloped\r\nisland. Only the land along the coast is cultivated, the central part\r\nbeing still covered by thick forests and inhabited by aborigines, and\r\nit is very rich in mineral deposits. When the whole island is fully\r\ndeveloped, the port of Hoihou will be a busy harbor for export and\r\nimport traffic. The harbor of Hoihou is very shallow, and so even small\r\nvessels have to anchor miles away in the roadstead outside. This is\r\nvery inconvenient for passengers and cargoes, so the improvement of the\r\nHoihou harbor is a necessity. Furthermore this harbor will be the ferry\r\npoint between this island and the mainland for railway traffic when the\r\nrailway systems of the mainland and the island are completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFishing Harbors\r\n\r\nAs regards fishing harbors all our first-, second-, and third-class\r\nports must also furnish facilities and accommodations for fishery.\r\nThus all of these, i.e., three first-class ports, four second-class\r\nports, and nine third-class ports, will be fishing harbors as well. But\r\nbesides these sixteen ports there is still room and need to construct\r\nmore fishing harbors along the coast of China. I propose, therefore,\r\nthat five fishing harbors be constructed along the northern coast, that\r\nis, along the coast of Fengtien, Chihli, and Shantung, as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Antung, on Yalu River, on the border of Korea.\r\n\r\n(2) Haiyangtao, on the Yalu Bay, south of Liaotung Peninsula.\r\n\r\n(3) Chinwangtao, on the coast of Chihli, between the Liaotung and\r\nPechihli gulfs, the present ice-free port of Chihli province.\r\n\r\n(4) Lungkau, on the northwestern side of Shantung Peninsula.\r\n\r\n(5) Shitauwan, at the southeastern point of the Shantung Peninsula.\r\n\r\nSix fishing harbors should be constructed along the eastern coast, that\r\nis, along the coasts of Kiangsu, Chekiang, and Fukien, as follows:\r\n\r\n(6) Shinyangkang, on the eastern coast of Kiangsu, south of the old\r\nmouth of the Hoangho.\r\n\r\n(7) Luszekang, at the northern point of the Yangtze Estuary.\r\n\r\n(8) Changtukang, in the midst of Chusan Archipelago.\r\n\r\n(9) Shipu, north of Sammen Bay, east of Chekiang.\r\n\r\n(10) Funing, between Foochow and Wenchow, east of Fukien.\r\n\r\n(11) Meichow Harbor, north of Meichow Island, between Foochow and Amoy.\r\n\r\nFour fishing harbors should be constructed on the southern coast, that\r\nis, along the seaboard of Kwangtung and Hainan Island, as follows.\r\n\r\n(12) Sanmei, on the eastern coast of Kwangtung, between Hongkong and\r\nSwatow.\r\n\r\n(13) Sikiang Mouth. This harbor should be on the northern side of\r\nWangkum Island. When the Sikiang Mouth is regulated, the Wangkum\r\nIsland will be connected with the mainland by a sea wall, so a good\r\nharbor site could thus be provided.\r\n\r\n(14) Haian, situated at the end of the Luichow Peninsula opposite to\r\nHoihou, on the other side of Hainan Strait.\r\n\r\n(15) Yulinkang a fine natural harbor at the extreme south of the Hainan\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThese fifteen fishing harbors with the greater ports, numbering 31\r\nin all, will link up the whole coast line of China from Antung, on\r\nthe Korean border to Yamchow, near the Annam border, providing, on an\r\naverage, a port for every 100 miles of coast line. This completes my\r\nproject of seaports and fishing harbors for China.\r\n\r\nAt first sight objections might be raised that too many seaports and\r\nfishing harbors are provided for one country. But I must remind my\r\nreaders that this one country, China, is as big as Europe and has a\r\npopulation larger than that of Europe. If we take a similar length\r\nof the coast line of western Europe we would see that there are many\r\nmore ports in Europe than in China. Besides, the coast line of Europe\r\nis many times longer than that of China, and in every hundred miles\r\nof the European coast line there are more than one considerable-sized\r\nport. Take Holland, for instance. Its whole area is not larger than the\r\nhinterland of Swatow, one of our third-class seaports, yet it possesses\r\ntwo first-class ports, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and numerous small\r\nfishing ports. Let us also compare our country with the United States\r\nof America in regard to seaports. America has only one fourth the\r\npopulation of China yet the number of ports on her Atlantic coast alone\r\nis many times more than the number provided in my plan. Thus, this\r\nnumber of ports for China for the future is but a bare necessity. And\r\nI have considered only those that will pay from the beginning so as to\r\nadhere strictly to the principle of remuneration that was laid down at\r\nthe outset of my first program. See Map XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nThe Establishment of Shipbuilding Yards\r\n\r\nWhen China is well developed according to my programs, the possession\r\nof an oversea mercantile fleet, of ships for coastal and inland\r\nwater transportation, and of a large fishing fleet will be an urgent\r\nnecessity. Before the outbreak of the late World War, the world's\r\nseagoing tonnage was 45,000,000 tons. If China is equally developed\r\nindustrially, according to the proportion of her population, she would\r\nneed at least 10,000,000 tons of oversea and coastal shipping for her\r\ntransportation service. The building of this tonnage must be a part of\r\nour industrial development scheme; for cheap materials and labor can\r\nbe obtained in the country, and so we could build ships for ourselves\r\nmuch cheaper than any foreign country could do for us. And besides the\r\nbuilding of a seagoing fleet, we have to build our inland water crafts\r\nand fishing fleets. Foreign shipping yards could not do this service\r\nfor us on account of the impracticability of transporting such numerous\r\nsmall crafts across the ocean. Thus, in any case, China has to put up\r\nher own yards to build her inland water crafts and fishing fleets. So\r\nthe establishment of ship building yards is a necessary as well as a\r\nprofitable undertaking from the beginning. The shipping yards should\r\nbe established at such river and coastal ports that have the facility\r\nof supplying materials and labor. All the yards should be under one\r\ncentral management. Large capital should be invested in the project so\r\nas to procure a yearly output of 2,000,000 tons of various kinds of\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nAll types of vessels should be standardized both in design and\r\nequipment. The old and wasteful types of inland water crafts and\r\nfishing boats should be replaced by modern efficient designs. The\r\ninland water crafts should be designed on the basis of certain standard\r\ndraughts such as the 2-foot, 5-foot, and 10-foot classes. The fishing\r\ntrawlers should be standardized into the one-day, the five-day, and the\r\nten-day service class. The coastal transports should be standardized\r\ninto the 2,000-, the 4,000-, and the 6,000-ton class, and for oversea\r\ntransports we should have standardized ships of 12,000-, 24,000-, and\r\n36,000-ton classes. Thus, the many thousands of inland water crafts and\r\nfishing junks that now ply the rivers, lakes, and coasts of China may\r\nbe displaced by new and cheaper crafts of a few standard types which\r\ncould perform better services at less expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my first and third programs, I have described my plans for the\r\nNorthwestern Railway System and the Southwestern Railway System. The\r\nformer is for the purpose of relieving the congestion of population\r\nin the coast districts and the Yangtze Valley by opening up for\r\ncolonization the vast unpopulated territory in Mongolia and Sinkiang,\r\nas well as of developing the Great Northern Port. The latter is for the\r\npurpose of exploiting the mineral resources of Southwestern China, as\r\nwell as of developing the Great Southern Port--Canton. More railroads\r\nwill be needed for the adequate development of the whole country. So in\r\nthis fourth program, I shall deal entirely with railroads which will\r\ncomplete the 100,000 miles proposed in my introductory part of this\r\nInternational Development Scheme. The program will be as follows:\r\n\r\n    I. The Central Railway System.\r\n   II. The Southeastern Railway System.\r\n  III. The Northeastern Railway System.\r\n   IV. The Extension of the Northwestern Railway System.\r\n    V. The Highland Railway System.\r\n   VI. The Establishment of Locomotive and Car Factories.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nThe Central Railway System\r\n\r\nThis will be the most important railway system in China. The area which\r\nit serves comprises all of China Proper north of the Yangtze and a part\r\nof Mongolia and Sinkiang. The economic nature of this vast region is\r\nthat the southeastern part is densely populated while the northwestern\r\npart is thinly populated, and that the southeastern part possesses\r\ngreat mineral wealth while the northwestern part possesses great\r\npotential agricultural resources. So every line of this system will\r\nsurely pay as the Peking-Mukden line has proved.\r\n\r\nWith the Great Eastern Port and the Great Northern Port as termini of\r\nthis system of railroads, I propose that, besides the existing and\r\nprojected lines in this region, the following be constructed, all of\r\nwhich shall constitute the Central Railway System.\r\n\r\n  a. The Great Eastern Port-Tarbogotai line.\r\n  b. The Great Eastern Port-Urga line.\r\n  c. The Great Eastern Port-Uliassutai line.\r\n  d. The Nanking-Loyang line.\r\n  e. The Nanking-Hankow line.\r\n  f. The Sian-Tatung line.\r\n  g. The Sian-Ninghsia line.\r\n  h. The Sian-Hankow line.\r\n  i. The Sian-Chungking line.\r\n  j. The Lanchow-Chungking line.\r\n  k. The Ansichow-Iden line.\r\n  l. The Chochiang-Koria line.\r\n  m. The Great Northern Port-Hami line.\r\n  n. The Great Northern Port-Sian line.\r\n  o. The Great Northern Port-Hankow line.\r\n  p. The Hoangho Port-Hankow line.\r\n  q. The Chefoo-Hankow line.\r\n  r. The Haichow-Tsinan line.\r\n  s. The Haichow-Hankow line.\r\n  t. The Haichow-Nanking line.\r\n  u. The Sinyangkang-Hankow line.\r\n  v. The Luszekang-Nanking line.\r\n  w. The Coast line.\r\n  x. The Hwoshan-Kashing line.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Great Eastern Port-Tarbogotai Line\r\n\r\nThis line begins at the Great Eastern Port on the seaboard, and runs\r\nin a northwesterly direction to Tarbogotai on the Russian frontier,\r\ncovering a distance of about 3,000 miles. If Shanghai be the Great\r\nEastern Port, the Shanghai-Nanking Railway will form its first section.\r\nBut if Chapu be chosen, then this line should skirt the Taihu Lake on\r\nthe southwest through the cities of Huchow, Changhing, and Liyang to\r\nNanking, then crossing the Yangtze at a point south of Nanking, to\r\nChiantsiao and Tingyuen. Thence, the line turns westward to Showchow\r\nand Yingshang, and enters Honan province at Sintsai. After crossing\r\nthe Peking-Hankow line at Kioshan, and passing Piyang, Tanghsien,\r\nand Tengchow, it turns northwestward to Sichwan and Kingtsekwan,\r\nand enters the province of Shensi. Ascending the Tan Kiang Valley,\r\nit passes through Lungkucha and Shangchow, and crosses the Tsinling\r\nPass to Lantien and Sian, the capital of Shensi, formerly the capital\r\nof China. From Sian, it goes westward, following the valley of the\r\nWeiho. It passes through Chowchih, Meihsien, and Paoki and enters the\r\nprovince of Kansu at Sancha, thence proceeding to Tsinchow, Kungchang,\r\nTitao, and Lanchow, the capital of Kansu. From Lanchow it follows the\r\nold highway which leads into Liangchow, Kanchow, Suchow, Yumen, and\r\nAnsichow. Thence it crosses the desert in a northwesterly direction to\r\nHami, where it turns westward to Turfan. At Turfan this line meets the\r\nNorthwestern Railway System and runs on the latter's track to Urumochi\r\nand Manass where it leaves that track and proceeds northwesterly to\r\nTarbogotai on the frontier, crossing the Shair Mountain on the way.\r\nThis line runs from one end of the country to the other encountering\r\nin its entire length of 3,000 miles only four mountain passes, all of\r\nwhich are not impassable for they have been used from time immemorial,\r\nas trade highways of Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Great Eastern Port-Urga Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from the Great Eastern Port and uses the same track\r\nas line (a) as far as Tingyuen, the second city after crossing the\r\nYangtze River at Nanking. From Tingyuen, its own track begins and\r\nthe line proceeds in a northwesterly direction to Hwaiyuan, on the\r\nHwai River, thence to Mongcheng, Kwoyang, and Pochow. Turning more\r\nnorthward, it crosses the Anhwei border into Honan, and passing through\r\nKweiteh it crosses the Honan border into Shantung. After passing\r\nthrough Tsaohsien, Tingtao, and Tsaochow, it crosses the Hoangho and\r\nenters Chihli province. Passing through Kaichow it re-enters Honan to\r\nChangteh, thence it follows the Tsingchangho valley, in a northwesterly\r\ndirection, across the Honan border into Shansi. Here the line enters\r\nthe northeastern corner of the vast iron and coal field of Shansi.\r\nAfter entering Shansi, the line follows the river valley to Liaochow\r\nand Yicheng, and crosses the watershed into the Tungkwoshui Valley to\r\nYutse and Taiyuan. From Taiyuan, it proceeds northwestward through\r\nanother rich iron and coal field of Shansi to Kolan. Thence, it turns\r\nwestward to Poate, where it crosses the Hoangho to Fuku, in the\r\nnortheastern corner of Shensi. From Fuku, the line proceeds northward,\r\ncuts through the Great Wall into the Suiyuan District and crosses the\r\nHoangho to Saratsi. From Saratsi, the line runs in a northwesterly\r\ndirection across the vast prairie to Junction A of the Northwestern\r\nTrunk Line, where it joins the common track of the Dolon Nor-Urga line\r\nto Urga. This line runs from a thickly populated country at one end\r\nin Central China to the vast thinly populated but fertile regions of\r\nCentral Mongolia, having a distance of about 1,300 miles from Tingyuen\r\nto Junction A.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The Great Eastern Port-Uliassutai Line\r\n\r\nStarting from the Great Eastern Port, this line follows line (a) as far\r\nas Tingyuen, and line (b) as far as Pochow. At Pochow, it branches off\r\non its own track and proceeds westward across the border to Luye, in\r\nHonan. Thence it turns northwestward to Taikang, Tungsu, and Chungmow\r\nwhere it meets the Hailan line and runs in the same direction with\r\nit to Chengchow, Jungyang, and Szeshui. From Szeshui it crosses the\r\nHoangho to Wenhsien, thence to Hwaiking and over the Honan border into\r\nShansi. It now passes through Yangcheng, Chinshui, and Fowshan to\r\nPingyang where it crosses the Fen River and proceeds to Puhsien and\r\nTaning, then westward to the border where it crosses the Hoangho into\r\nShensi. Thence it proceeds to Yenchang, and follows the Yenshui Valley\r\nto Yenan, Siaokwan, and Tsingpien. Then running along the south side of\r\nthe Great Wall, it enters Kansu, and crosses the Hoangho to Ninghsia.\r\nFrom Ninghsia, it proceeds northwestward across the Alashan Mountain\r\nto Tingyuanying at the edge of the desert. Thence it proceeds in a\r\nstraight line northwestward to Junction B of the Northwestern Railway\r\nSystem, where it joins that system and runs to Uliassutai. This part\r\nof the line passes through desert and grassland both of which could\r\nbe improved by irrigation. The distance of this line from Pochow to\r\nJunction B is 1,800 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The Nanking-Loyang Line\r\n\r\nThis line runs between two former capitals of China, passes through a\r\nvery populous and fertile country, and taps a very rich coal field at\r\nthe Loyang end. It starts from Nanking, running on the common track\r\nof lines (a) and (b) and branches off at Hwaiyuan westward to Taiho.\r\nAfter passing Taiho, it crosses the Anhwei border into Honan. Thence\r\nit runs alongside the left bank of the Tashaho to Chowkiakow, a large\r\ncommercial town. From Chowkiakow, it proceeds to Linying where it\r\ncrosses the Peking-Hankow line thence to Hiangcheng and Yuchow where\r\nthe rich coal field of Honan lies. After Yuchow it crosses the Sungshan\r\nwatershed to Loyang where it meets the Hailan line running from east to\r\nwest. This line is about 300 miles from Hwaiyuan to Loyang.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. The Nanking-Hankow Line\r\n\r\nThis line will run alongside the left bank of the Yangtzekiang,\r\nconnecting with Kiukiang by a branch line. It starts on the opposite\r\nside of Nanking and goes southwest to Hochow, Wuweichow and Anking,\r\nthe capital of Anwei province. After Anking, it continues in the same\r\ndirection to Susung and Hwangmei, where a branch should be projected\r\nto Siaochikow, thence across the Yangtze River to Kiukiang. After\r\nHwangmei, the line turns westward to Kwangchi, then northwestward to\r\nKishui, and finally westward to Hankow. It covers a distance of about\r\n350 miles through a comparatively level country.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. The Sian-Tatung Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Sian and runs northward to Sanyuan, Yaochow,\r\nTungkwan, Yichun, Chungpu, Foochow, Kanchuan, and Yenan, where it\r\nmeets the Great Eastern Port-Uliassutai line. From Yenan, it turns\r\nnortheastward to Suiteh, Michih, and Kiachow on the right bank of\r\nthe Hoangho. Thence it runs along the same bank to the junction of\r\nthe Weifen River with the Hoangho (on the opposite side), where it\r\ncrosses the Hoangho to the Weifen Valley and proceeds to Singhsien and\r\nKolan, there crossing the Great Eastern Port-Urga line. From Kolan,\r\nit proceeds to Wuchai and Yangfang, where it crosses the Great Wall\r\nto Sochow and then Tatung there meeting the Peking-Suiyuan line. This\r\nline is about 600 miles long. It passes through the famous oil field in\r\nShensi, and the northern border of the northwestern Shansi coal field.\r\nAt Tatung, where it ends, it joins the Peking-Suiyuan line and through\r\nthe section from Tatung to Kalgan it will connect with the future\r\nNorthwestern System which will link Kalgan and Dolon Nor together.\r\n\r\n\r\ng. The Sian-Ninghsia Line\r\n\r\nThis line will start from Sian in a northwesterly direction to\r\nKingyanghsien, Shunhwa, and Sanshui. After Sanshui, it crosses the\r\nShensi border into Kansu at Chengning and then turns west to Ningchow.\r\nFrom Ningchow, it follows the Hwan Valley along the left bank of the\r\nriver up to Kingyangfu and Hwanhsien, where it leaves the bank and\r\nproceeds to Tsingping and Pingyuan, where it meets the Hwan River\r\nagain and follows that valley up to the watershed. After crossing\r\nthe watershed, it proceeds to Lingchow, then across the Hoangho to\r\nNinghsia. This line covers a distance of about 400 miles and passes\r\nthrough a rich mineral and petroleum country.\r\n\r\n\r\nh. The Sian-Hankow Line\r\n\r\nThis is a very important line connecting the richest portion of the\r\nHoangho Valley with the richest portion of the central section of the\r\nYangtze Valley. It starts from Sian on the track of line (a), crosses\r\nthe Tsingling and descends the Tankiang Valley as far as Sichwan. At\r\nthis point, it branches off southward across the border into Hupeh, and\r\nfollowing the left bank of the Han River, passes Laohokow to Fencheng,\r\nopposite Siangyang. After Fencheng, it follows continuously the same\r\nbank of the Han River to Anlu, thence proceeding in a direct line\r\nsoutheastward to Hanchwan and Hankow. This line is about 300 miles long.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. The Sian-Chungking Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Sian almost directly southward, crosses the\r\nTsingling Mountain into the Han Valley, passes through Ningshen,\r\nShihchuan, and Tzeyang, ascends the Jenho Valley across the southern\r\nborder of Shensi into the province of Szechwan at Tachuho. Then\r\ncrossing the watershed of the Tapashan into the Tapingho Valley, it\r\nfollows that valley down to Suiting and Chuhsien. Thence it turns to\r\nthe left side of the valley to Linshui and follows the trade road to\r\nKiangpeh and Chungking. The entire distance of this line is about 450\r\nmiles through a very productive region and rich timber land.\r\n\r\n\r\nj. The Lanchow-Chungking Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Lanchow southwestward and follows the same route\r\nas line (a) as far as Titao. Thence, it branches off and ascends the\r\nTaoho Valley across the Minshan watershed into the Heishui Valley\r\nfollowing it down to Kiaichow and Pikow. After Pikow, it crosses the\r\nKansu border into Szechwan and proceeds to Chaohwa, where the Heishuiho\r\njoins the Kialing. From Chaohwa, it follows the course of the Kialing\r\nRiver down to Paoning, Shunking, Hochow, and Chungking. The line is\r\nabout 600 miles long, running through a very productive and rich\r\nmineral land.\r\n\r\n\r\nk. The Ansichow-Iden line\r\n\r\nThis line passes through the fertile belt of land between the Gobi\r\nDesert and the Altyntagh Mountain. Although this strip of land is\r\nwell watered by numerous mountain streams yet it is very sparsely\r\npopulated, owing to the lack of means of communication. When this line\r\nis completed, this strip of land will be most valuable to Chinese\r\ncolonists. The line starts from Ansichow westward to Tunhwang, and\r\nskirts the southern edge of the Lobnor Swamp to Chochiang. From\r\nChochiang, it proceeds in the same direction via Cherchen to Iden where\r\nit connects with the terminus of the Northwestern System. With this\r\nSystem, it forms a continuous and direct line from the Great Eastern\r\nPort to Kashgar at the extreme west end of China. This line from\r\nAnsichow to Iden is about 800 miles in length.\r\n\r\n\r\nl. The Chochiang-Koria Line\r\n\r\nThis line runs across the desert alongside the lower part of the Tarim\r\nRiver. The land on both sides of the line is well watered and will be\r\nvaluable for colonization as soon as the railroad is completed. This\r\nline is about 250 miles in length and connects with the line that\r\nruns along the northern edge of the desert. It is a short cut between\r\nfertile lands on the two sides of the desert.\r\n\r\n\r\nm. The Great Northern Port-Hami Line\r\n\r\nThis line runs from the Great Northern Port in a northwesterly\r\ndirection by way of Paoti and Siangho to Peking. From Peking it\r\nruns on the same track with the Peking-Kalgan Railway to Kalgan,\r\nwhere it ascends the Mongolian Plateau. Then it follows the caravan\r\nroad northwestward to Chintai, Bolutai, Sessy, and Tolibulyk. From\r\nTolibulyk, it takes a straight line westward crossing the prairie and\r\ndesert of both the Inner and Outer Mongolia to Hami where it connects\r\nwith the Great Eastern Port-Tarbogotai line which runs almost directly\r\nwest to Urumochi, the capital of Sinkiang. Thus, it will be the direct\r\nline from Urumochi to Peking and the Great Northern Port. This line is\r\nabout 1,500 miles in length, the greater part of which will run through\r\narable land and so when it is completed it will form one of the most\r\nvaluable railways for colonization.\r\n\r\n\r\nn. The Great Northern Port-Sian Line\r\n\r\nThis line will run westward from the Great Northern Port to Tientsin.\r\nFrom here it runs southwestward to Hokien, passing through Tsinghai\r\nand Tachen. From Hokien, it runs more westerly to Shentseh, Wuki, and\r\nChengting where it joins the Chengtai line as well as crosses the\r\nKinhan line. From Chengting it takes the same road as the narrow gauge\r\nChengtai line which has to be reconstructed into standard gauge so as\r\nto facilitate through trains to Taiyuan and farther on. From Taiyuan\r\nit runs southwestward to Kiaocheng, Wenshui, Fenchow, Sichow, and\r\nTaning. After Taning it turns westward and crossing the Hoangho, it\r\nturns southwestward to Yichwan, Lochwan, and Chungpu where it joins the\r\nSian-Tatung line and runs on the same tracks to Sian. Its length is\r\nabout 700 miles over very rich and extensive iron, coal, and petroleum\r\nfields, as well as productive agricultural lands.\r\n\r\n\r\no. The Great Northern Port-Hankow Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from the Great Northern Port skirting the coast to\r\nPetang, Taku, and Chikow, thence to Yenshan and crosses the Chili\r\nborder into Shantung at Loling. From Loling, it goes to Tehping,\r\nLinyi and Yucheng where it crosses the Tientsin-Pukow line, proceeds\r\nto Tungchang and Fanhsien, and then crosses the Hoangho to Tsaochow.\r\nAfter Tsaochow it passes the Shantung border into Honan, crossing the\r\nHailan line to Suichow. From Suichow it proceeds to Taikang where it\r\ncrosses line (c), then to Chenchow and Chowkiakow where it crosses line\r\n(d) and thence to Siangcheng, Sintsai, Kwangchow, and Kwangshan. After\r\nKwangshan it crosses the boundary mountain into Hupeh, passing through\r\nHwangan to Hankow. This line is about 700 miles long, running from the\r\nGreat Northern Port to the commercial center of central China.\r\n\r\n\r\np. The Hoangho Port-Hankow Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from the Hoangho Port in a southwesterly direction to\r\nPohsing, Sincheng, and Changshan, then across the Kiauchow-Tsinan line\r\nto Poshan. Thence it ascends the watershed into the Wen Valley to Taian\r\nwhere it crosses the Tientsin-Pukow line to Ningyang and Tsining.\r\nFrom Tsining it proceeds in a straight line southwestward to Pochow in\r\nAnhwei, and Sintsai in Honan. At Sintsai it joins the Great Northern\r\nPort-Hankow line to Hankow. The distance of this line from the Hoangho\r\nPort to Sintsai is about 400 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nq. The Chefoo-Hankow Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts at Chefoo on the northern side of the Shantung\r\nPeninsula and crosses that Peninsula to Tsimo, on the southern side,\r\nvia Laiyang and Kinkiakow. From Tsimo it proceeds southwestward across\r\nthe shallow mud flat at the head of Kiauchow Bay in a straight line\r\nto Chucheng. After Chucheng it crosses the watershed into the Shuho\r\nValley to Chuchow and Ichow, then proceeds to Hsuchow where it meets\r\nthe Tientsin-Pukow line and the Hailan line. From Hsuchow it runs on\r\nthe same track with the Tientsin-Pukow line as far as Suchow in Anhwei,\r\nthen branches off to Mongcheng and Yinchow, and crosses the border into\r\nHonan at Kwangchow, where it meets the Great Northern Port-Hankow line\r\nand proceeds together to Hankow. This line from Chefoo to Kwangchow is\r\nabout 550 miles in length.\r\n\r\n\r\nr. The Haichow-Tsinan Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Haichow following the Linhung River to Kwantunpu,\r\nthen turns westward to Ichow. From Ichow it turns first northward then\r\nnorthwestward, passing by Mongyin and Sintai to Tai-an. At Tai-an it\r\njoins the Tsinpu line and proceeds in the same track to Tsinan. This\r\nline covers a distance, from Haichow to Tai-an, of about 110 miles,\r\ntapping the coal and iron fields of southern Shantung.\r\n\r\n\r\ns. The Haichow-Hankow Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts at Haichow in a southwesterly direction, goes to\r\nShuyang and Sutsien, probably in the same route as the projected\r\nHailan line. From Sutsien it proceeds to Szechow and Hwaiyuan, where\r\nit crosses the Great Eastern Port Urga and Uliassutai lines. After\r\nHwaiyuan it goes to Showchow and Chenyangkwan, thence continuing in\r\nthe same direction across the southeastern corner of Honan and the\r\nboundary mountain into Hupeh, proceeds to Macheng and Hankow, covering\r\na distance of about 400 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nt. The Haichow-Nanking Line\r\n\r\nThis line goes from Haichow southward to Antung then inclining a little\r\nsouth to Hwaian. After Hwaian it crosses the Paoying Lake (which will\r\nbe reclaimed according to the regulation of the Hwaiho in Part IV,\r\nProgram II) to Tienchang and Luho, thence to Nanking. Distance, about\r\n180 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nu. The Sinyangkang-Hankow Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Sinyangkang to Yencheng, then crossing the\r\nTasung Lake (which will be reclaimed) to Hwaian. From Hwaian it turns\r\nsouthwestward passing over the southeastern corner of the Hungtse\r\nLake (which will also be reclaimed) to Suyi, in Anhwei. After Suyi,\r\nit crosses the Tientsin-Pukow line near Mingkwang, to Tingyuen, where\r\nit meets lines (b) and (c). After Tingyuen, it proceeds to Lu-an and\r\nHwoshan, then crosses the boundary mountain into Hupeh passing through\r\nLotien to Hankow, a distance of about 420 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nv. The Luszekang-Nanking Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts at Luszekang, a fishing harbor to be constructed\r\nat the extremity of the northern point of the Yangtze Estuary. From\r\nLuszekang it proceeds westward to Tungchow where it turns northwestward\r\nto Jukao, and then westward to Taichow, Yangchow, Luho, and Nanking.\r\nThis line is about 200 miles long.\r\n\r\n\r\nw. The Coast Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts at the Great Northern Port, and follows the Great\r\nNorthern Port-Hankow line as far as Chikow, where it begins its own\r\nline. Keeping along the coast, it crosses the Chili border to the\r\nHoangho Port, in Shantung, then proceeds to Laichow where it takes\r\na straight cut away from the coast to Chaoyuan and Chefoo, thus\r\navoiding the projected Chefoo-Weihsien line. From Chefoo it proceeds\r\nsoutheastward through Ninghai to Wenteng, where one branch runs to\r\nJungcheng and another to Shihtao. The main line turns southwestward\r\nto Haiyang and Kinkiakow, where it joins the Chefoo-Hankow line, and\r\nfollows it as far as the western side of Kiauchow Bay, thence southward\r\nto Lingshanwei. From Lingshanwei the line proceeds southwestward along\r\nthe coast to Jichao, and crosses the Shantung border into Kiangsu,\r\npassing Kanyu to Haichow. Thence it proceeds southeastward to Yencheng,\r\nTungtai, Tungchow, Haimen, and Tsungming Island which will be connected\r\nwith the mainland by the regulation works of Yangtze embankment. From\r\nTsungming trains can be ferried over to Shanghai. This line from Chikow\r\nto Tsungming is about 1,000 miles in length.\r\n\r\n\r\nx. The Hwoshan-Wuhu-Soochow-Kashing Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Hwoshan to Shucheng and Wuwei, then across the\r\nYangtze River to Wuhu. After Wuhu it goes to Kaoshun, Liyang, and\r\nIhing, then crosses over the northern end of Taihu (which will be\r\nreclaimed) to Soochow, where it meets the Shanghai-Nanking line. From\r\nSoochow it turns southward to Kashing on the Shanghai-Hangchow line.\r\nThis line runs over very populous and rich districts of Anhwei and\r\nKiangsu provinces, covering a distance of about 300 miles, which will\r\nform the greater part of the shortest line from Shanghai to Hankow.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nThe Southeastern Railway System\r\n\r\nThis system covers the irregular triangle which is formed by the Coast\r\nline between the Great Eastern and the Great Southern Ports, as the\r\nbase, by the Yangtze River from Chungking to Shanghai, as one side,\r\nand by line (a) of the Canton-Chungking Railway as the other side,\r\nwith Chungking as the apex. This triangle comprises the provinces of\r\nChekiang, Fukien, and Kiangsi, and a part respectively of Kiangsu,\r\nAnhwei, Hupeh, Hunan, and Kwangtung. This region is very rich in\r\nmineral and agricultural products, especially iron and coal deposits\r\nwhich are found everywhere. And the whole region is thickly populated.\r\nSo railway construction will be very remunerative.\r\n\r\nWith the Great Eastern Port and the Great Southern Port and the\r\nsecond-and third-class ports that lie between the two as termini\r\nof this system of railroads, I propose that the following lines be\r\nconstructed:\r\n\r\n  a. The Great Eastern Port-Chungking Line.\r\n  b. The Great Eastern Port-Canton Line.\r\n  c. The Foochow-Chinkiang Line.\r\n  d. The Foochow-Wuchang Line.\r\n  e. The Foochow-Kweilin Line.\r\n  f. The Wenchow-Shenchow Line.\r\n  g. The Amoy-Kienchang Line.\r\n  h. The Amoy-Canton Line.\r\n  i. The Swatow-Changteh Line.\r\n  j. The Nanking-Siuchow Line.\r\n  k. The Nanking-Kaying Line.\r\n  l. The Coast Line between the Great Eastern and Great Southern Ports.\r\n  m. The Kienchang-Yuanchow Line.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Great Eastern Port-Chungking Line\r\n\r\nThis line connects the commercial center of western\r\nChina--Chungking--with the Great Eastern Port in almost a straight\r\nroute south of the Yangtze River. It starts from the Great Eastern\r\nPort and goes to Hangchow, then through Linan, Ghanghwa, to Hweichow,\r\nin Anhwei. From Hweichow it proceeds to Siuning and Kimen, then\r\ncrosses the border into Kiangsi and passing Hukow reaches Kiukiang.\r\nFrom Kiukiang it follows the right bank of the Yangtze, crosses\r\nthe Hupeh border to Hingkwochow and then proceeds to Tungshan and\r\nTsungyang, where it passes over the border to Yochow in Hunan. From\r\nYochow it takes a straight line across the Tungting Lake (which will\r\nbe reclaimed) to Changteh. From Changteh it proceeds up the Liu Shui\r\nValley, passing through Tzeli, and crossing the Hunan border to Hofeng,\r\nin Hupeh and then to Shinan and Lichwan. At Shinan a branch should be\r\nprojected northeastward to Ichang, and at Lichwan another branch should\r\nbe projected northwestward to Wanhsien, both on the left side of the\r\nYangtze River. After Lichwan it crosses the Hupeh border into Szechwan,\r\npassing Shihchu to Foochow, then passes the Wukiang and proceeds along\r\nthe right side of the Yangtze River as far as lines (a) and (b) of the\r\nCanton-Chungking Railway and then crosses together on the same bridge\r\nto Chungking on the other side of the river. The length of this line\r\nincluding branches, is about 1,200 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Great Eastern Port-Canton Line\r\n\r\nThis is a straight line from one first-class seaport to another.\r\nIt starts from the Great Eastern Port and goes to Hangchow, then\r\nturning southwestward, follows the left bank of the Tsien Tang River\r\nthrough Fuyang, Tunglu to Yenchow and Chuchow. Then it proceeds\r\nacross the Chekiang-Kiangsi border to Kwangsin. From Kwangsin it goes\r\nthrough Shangtsing and Kinki to Kienchang, then proceeds to Nanfeng,\r\nKwangchang, and Ningtu. After Ningtu it proceeds to Yutu, Sinfeng,\r\nLungnan, and crossing the boundary mountain of Kiangsi and Kwangtung,\r\nto Changning. Thence via Tsungfa it goes to Canton, covering a distance\r\nof about 900 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The Foochow-Chinkiang Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Foochow, goes by way of Loyuan and Ningteh to\r\nFuan, and then proceeds across the Fukien-Chekiang border to Taishun,\r\nKingning, Yunho, and Chuchow. Thence it proceeds to Wuyi, Yiwu, Chukih,\r\nand Hangchow. After Hangchow it goes to Tehtsing and Huchow and then\r\ncrosses the Chekiang border into Kiangsu. Then it proceeds by way of\r\nIhing, Kintan, and Tanyang to Chinkiang. This line is about 550 miles\r\nin length.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The Foochow-Wuchang Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Foochow and following the left bank of the Min\r\nRiver and passing Shuikow and Yenping reaches Shaowu. After Shaowu, it\r\nproceeds across the Fukien border into Kiangsi and then passes through\r\nKienchang and Fuchow to Nanchang, the capital of Kiangsi. From Nanchang\r\nit proceeds to Hingkwo, in Hupeh, and passes on to Wuchang, the capital\r\nof Hupeh. It covers a distance of about 550 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. The Foochow-Kweilin Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Foochow, crosses the Min River and proceeds by\r\nway of Yungfu, Tatien, Ningyang, and Liencheng to Tingchow. Thence it\r\ncrosses the Fukien-Kiangsi border to Shuikin. From Shuikin it proceeds\r\nto Yutu and Kanchow and then to Shangyiu and Chungyi. After Chungyi it\r\ncrosses the Kiangsi-Hunan border to Kweiyanghsien and Chenchow, where\r\nit crosses the Canton-Hankow line to Kweiyangchow. Thence it continues\r\nto Sintien, Ningyuan, and Taochow, where it meets lines (a) and (b)\r\nof the Canton-Chungking Railway. After Taochow it turns southward\r\nfollowing the Taoho Valley to the Kwangsi border and then crossing it,\r\nproceeds to Kweilin. This line covers a distance of about 750 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. The Wenchow-Shenchow Line\r\n\r\nThis line begins from the new Wenchow Port and follows the left bank\r\nof the Wukiang as far as Tsingtien. From Tsingtien it proceeds to\r\nChuchow and Suenping and turns westward across the Chekiang border\r\nto Yushan in Kiangsi. After Yushan it goes to Tehsing, Loping, and\r\nthen skirting the southern shore of Poyang Lake goes through Yukan to\r\nNanchang, the capital of Kiangsi. From Nanchang it proceeds to Juichow,\r\nShangkao, and Wantsai, then crosses the Kiangsi border to Liuyang in\r\nHunan, and Changsha, the capital of Hunan. After Changsha it goes to\r\nNingsiang, Anhwa, and Shenchow where it connects with line (a) of the\r\nCanton-Chungking Railway, and with the Shasi-Singyi line. This line\r\ncovers a distance of about 850 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\ng. The Amoy-Kienchang Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from the new port of Amoy and goes to Changtai, then\r\nfollowing the Kiulungkiang to Changping, Ningyang, Tsingliu, and\r\nKienning. After Kienning it proceeds across the Kiangsi border to\r\nKienchang, where it connects with the Great Eastern Port-Canton line,\r\nthe Foochow-Wuchang line, and the Kienchang-Yuanchow line. This line\r\ncovers a distance of about 250 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nh. The Amoy-Canton Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts at the new port of Amoy, and proceeds to Changchow,\r\nNantsing, and Siayang, where it crosses the Fukien border to Tapu, in\r\nKwangtung. From Tapu it goes to Tsungkow, Kaying, Hinning, and Wuhwa.\r\nAfter Wuhwa it crosses the watershed between the Hankiang and the\r\nTungkiang rivers to Lungchan, then following the Tungkiang down to\r\nHoyun, it crosses another watershed to Lungmoon, Tsengshin and Canton.\r\nThis line covers a distance of about 400 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. The Swatow-Changteh Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Swatow, proceeds to Chaochow, Kaying, and then\r\ncrosses the Kwangtung border to Changning in Kiangsi. From Changning\r\nit crosses the watershed into Kungkiang Valley and follows that river\r\ndown to Hweichang and Kanchow. From Kanchow it proceeds to Lungchuan,\r\nYungning, and Lienhwa, where it crosses the Kiangsi border into Hunan.\r\nAfter that, it proceeds to Chuchow and Changsha, the capital of Hunan.\r\nFrom Changsha it goes to Ningsiang, Yiyang, and Changteh where it\r\nends, connecting with the Great Eastern Port-Chungking line, and the\r\nShasia-Singyi line. This line covers a distance of about 650 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nj. The Nanking-Siuchow Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Nanking and runs along the right bank of the\r\nYangtze to Taiping, Wuhu, Tungling, Chichow, and Tungliu. After\r\nTungliu it passes over the Anhwei border into Kiangsi, at Pengtseh,\r\nand goes to Hukow. At Hukow it meets the Great Eastern Port-Chungking\r\nline and crosses the bridge together with that line to the projected\r\nPoyang Port. From the Poyang Port it runs along the west shore of\r\nthe Poyang Lake through Nanking and Wucheng to Nanchang, where it\r\nmeets the Wenchow-Shenchow and Foochow-Wuchang lines. From Nanchang\r\nit proceeds up the Kan Kiang Valley, via Linkiang to Kian, where it\r\ncrosses the projected Kienchang-Yuanchow line. After Kian, it proceeds\r\nto Kanchow where it crosses the Foochow-Kweilin line. Thence it goes to\r\nNankanghsien and Nanan. After Nanan it crosses the boundary mountain,\r\nTayuling, into Kwangtung at Nanyung, thence passes through Chihing to\r\nSiuchow, where it meets the Canton-Hankow line. This line covers a\r\ndistance of about 800 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nk. The Nanking-Kaying Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Nanking, proceeds to Lishui and Kaoshun and then\r\ncrosses the Kiangsu border into Anhwei at Suencheng. From Suencheng it\r\nproceeds to Ningkwo and Hweichow. After Hweichow it crosses the Anhwei\r\nborder into Chekiang, passing through Kaihwa, Changshan, and Kiangshan,\r\nand leaving Chekiang enters Fukien at Pucheng. From Pucheng it proceeds\r\nvia Kienningfu to Yenping where it crosses the Foochow-Wuchang line and\r\nthen goes through Shahsien and Yungan to Ningyang, where it meets the\r\nFoochow-Kweilin and Amoy-Kienchang lines. From Ningyang it proceeds to\r\nLungyen and Yungting, then joining the Amoy-Canton line at Tsungkow\r\nproceeds together to Kaying, its terminus. This line runs over a\r\ndistance of about 750 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nl. The Coast Line Between the Great Eastern and the Great Southern Ports\r\n\r\nThis line starts from the Great Southern Port--Canton--proceeds in\r\nthe same direction as the Canton-Kowloon line as far as Shelung and\r\nthen goes its own way following the course of the Tungkiang River to\r\nWaichow. From Waichow it proceeds to Samtochuck, Haifung, and Lukfung,\r\nthen turning northeastward goes to Kityang and Chaochow. After Chaochow\r\nit goes to Jaoping, then crossing the Kwangtung-Fukien border to\r\nChaoan. Thence it proceeds to Yunsiao, Changpu, Changchow, and Amoy.\r\nFrom Amoy it proceeds to Chuanchow, Hinghwa, and Foochow, the capital\r\nof Fukien. After Foochow it proceeds in the same direction as the\r\nFoochow-Chinkiang line, as far as Fuan, then turns eastward to Funing,\r\nand northward to Futing. After Futing it crosses the Fukien border\r\ninto Chekiang and proceeds through Pingyang to Wenchow. At Wenchow it\r\ncrosses the Wukiang and proceeds to Lotsing, Hwangyen, and Taichow.\r\nThence, it proceeds through Ninghai to Ningpo, its own terminus, where\r\nit connects with the Ningpo-Hangchow line, thus linking it up with\r\nthe Great Eastern Port via Hangchow. This line covers a distance from\r\nCanton to Ningpo of about 1,100 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nm. The Kienchang-Yuanchow Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Kienchang and runs through Yihwang, Loan,\r\nYungfeng, and Kishui to Kian, where it crosses the Nanking-Siuchow\r\nline. After Kian it proceeds to Yungsin and Lienhwa where it meets\r\nthe Swatow-Changteh line. Thence it crosses the Kiangsi border into\r\nHunan, at Chaling, then through Anjen to Hengchow where it crosses the\r\nCanton-Hankow line. From Hengchow the line proceeds to Paoking where\r\nit crosses line (a) of the Canton-Chungking Railway then westward to\r\nYuanchow, its terminus, where it joins with the Shasi-Singyi line. This\r\nline covers a distance of about 550 miles. The total length of this\r\nSoutheastern Railway System is about 9,000 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nThe Northeastern Railway System\r\n\r\nThis system will cover the whole of Manchuria, a part of Mongolia, and\r\na part of Chihli province--an area of nearly 500,000 square miles, with\r\na population of 25,000,000. This region is surrounded by mountains\r\non three sides and opens on the south to the Liaotung Gulf. Amidst\r\nthese three mountain ranges lies a vast and fertile plain drained by\r\nthree rivers--the Nonni on the north, the Sungari on the northeast,\r\nand the Liaoho on the south. This part of China was once regarded as a\r\ndesert, but since the completion of the Chinese Eastern Railway it has\r\nbeen found to be the most productive soil in China. It supplies the\r\nwhole of Japan and a part of China with nitrogenous food in the form\r\nof soya bean. This bean, the wonderful properties of which were early\r\ndiscovered by the Chinese, contains the richest nitrogenous substance\r\namong vegetables and has been used as a meat substitute for many\r\nthousand years. Vegetable milk is extracted from this bean, and from\r\nthis milk various kinds of preparations are made. The extraction from\r\nthis bean has been proved by modern chemists to be richer than any kind\r\nof meat. The Chinese and the Japanese have used this kind of artificial\r\nmeat and milk from time immemorial. Recently food administrators in\r\nEurope and America have paid great attention to this meat substitute,\r\nwhile the export of soya bean to Europe and America has steadily\r\nincreased. This Manchu-Mongolian plain is destined to be the source of\r\nthe world's supply of soya bean. Besides soya bean, this plain also\r\nproduces a great quantity of various kinds of grains, and supplies\r\nthe entire Eastern Siberia with wheat. The Manchurian mountains are\r\nexceedingly rich in timber and minerals--gold being especially found in\r\ngreat quantities in many localities.\r\n\r\nRailway construction in this region has proved to be a most profitable\r\nundertaking. At present there are already three railway systems\r\ntapping this rich country, viz., the Peking-Mukden line, the best\r\npaying railroad in China, the Japanese South-Manchurian Railway, also\r\na very remunerative line, and the Chinese Eastern Railway, the best\r\npaying portion of the whole Siberian system. Besides these, there are\r\nmany lines projected by the Japanese. In order to develop this rich\r\nregion properly a network of railways should be projected.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with the separate lines of this network of railways, I\r\nshould like to propose a center for them, just as the spider's nest is\r\nto a cobweb. I shall name this central city \"Tungchin,\" the Eastern\r\nMart, which should be situated at a point southwest of the junction\r\nof the Sungari and Nonni rivers, about 110 miles west by south from\r\nHarbin, and will be in a more advantageous position than the latter.\r\nThis new city will be the center not only of the railway system but\r\nalso of the inland water communication when the Liaoho-Sungari Canal is\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nWith the projected city of Tungchin as a center, I propose the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n  a. The Tungchin-Hulutao line.\r\n  b. The Tungchin-Great Northern Port line.\r\n  c. The Tungchin-Dolon Nor line.\r\n  d. The Tungchin-Kerulen line\r\n  e. The Tungchin-Moho line.\r\n  f. The Tungchin-Korfen line.\r\n  g. The Tungchin-Yaoho line.\r\n  h. The Tungchin-Yenchi line.\r\n  i. The Tungchin-Changpeh line.\r\n  j. The Hulutao-Jehol-Peking line.\r\n  k. The Hulutao-Kerulen line.\r\n  l. The Hulutao-Hailar line.\r\n  m. The Hulutao-Antung line.\r\n  n. The Moho-Suiyuan line.\r\n  o. The Huma-Chilalin or Shihwei line.\r\n  p. The Ussuri-Tumen-Yalu-Coast line.\r\n  q. The Linkiang-Dolon Nor line.\r\n  r. The Chikatobo-Sansing or Ilan line.\r\n  s. The Sansing or Ilan-Kirin line.\r\n  t. The Kirin-Dolon Nor line.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Tungchin-Hulutao Line\r\n\r\nThis is the first line that radiates from this projected Manchurian\r\nrailway center, and is the shorter of the two direct lines that lead\r\nto the ice-free ports on the Liaotung-Chihli Gulf. It runs almost\r\nparallel to the South Manchurian Railway, the distance between the\r\ntwo lines being about 80 miles at the northern end, converging to 40\r\nmiles at Sinmin, and diverging again after that point. According to\r\nthe original agreement with the former Russian Government, no parallel\r\nline within 100 miles was allowed to be built. But such restriction\r\nmust be abolished under this new International Development Scheme for\r\nthe benefit of all concerned. This line starts from Tungchin, and\r\nproceeds southward across the vast Manchurian plain by Changling,\r\nShuangshan, Liaoyuan, and Kangping, to Sinmin in a straight line\r\ncovering a distance of about 270 miles. After Sinmin, the line joins\r\nthe Peking-Mukden Railway and runs on the same track for a distance of\r\nabout 130 miles to Hulutao.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Tungchin-Great Northern Port Line\r\n\r\nThis line is the second that radiates from this railway center direct\r\nto a deep water ice-free seaport. It starts from Tungchin, proceeding\r\nin a southwesterly direction, passes Kwangan, midway between Tungchin\r\nand the West Liaoho, and many other small settlements before it crosses\r\nthe Liaoho. After crossing the Liaoho, it enters the mountainous\r\nregions of the Jehol district by a valley to Fowsin, a hsien city, and\r\ncrosses the watershed into the Talingho Valley. After passing through\r\nthe Talingho Valley, the line crosses another watershed into the Luan\r\nValley by a branch of the same river. Then it penetrates the Great Wall\r\nand proceeds to the Great Northern Port by way of Yungping and Loting.\r\nThe whole length of this line is about 550 miles, the first half of\r\nwhich is on level land and the second half in mountainous country.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The Tungchin-Dolon Nor Line\r\n\r\nThis is the third line that radiates from the railway center and\r\nproceeds nearly in a westerly direction across the plain to Taonan\r\nwhere it crosses the projected Aigun-Jehol line (Japanese), and also\r\nmeets the termini of two other projected lines, the Changchun-Taonan\r\nand the Tsengkiatun-Taonan (Japanese). After Taonan, the line turns\r\nmore southward by skirting along the foothills of the southeastern side\r\nof the Great Khingan range where vast virgin forests and rich minerals\r\nare found. Then it passes through the upper Liaoho Valley formed by\r\nthe Great Khingan Mountain on the north, and the Jehol Mountain on the\r\nsouth and through the towns of Linsi and Kingpang to Dolon Nor, where\r\nit meets the trunk line of the Northwestern Railway system. This line\r\ncovers a distance of about 480 miles, a greater part of which is on\r\nlevel land.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The Tungchin-Kerulen Line\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth line that radiates from the Tungchin Railway\r\ncenter. It runs in a northwesterly direction almost parallel with the\r\nHarbin-Manchuli line of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the distance\r\nbetween the two lines varying from 100 to 130 miles. The line starts\r\nfrom Tungchin on the north side of the junction of the Nonni and\r\nSungari rivers and proceeds westward across the Nonni River to Talai,\r\nand then turns northwestward across the plain into the valley of the\r\nnorth branch of the Guileli River. After entering the valley, it\r\nfollows the stream up to its source, then crosses the Great Khingan\r\nMountain watershed into the Mongolian Plain by the Khalka River, and\r\nfollows the right bank of this river to the north end of Bor Nor Lake.\r\nThence it turns directly westward to the Kerulen River, and follows\r\nthe south bank of the river to Kerulen. This line covers a distance of\r\nabout 630 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. The Tungchin-Moho Line\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth line that radiates from this railway center. It\r\nstarts from the north side of the junction of the Nonni and Sungari\r\nrivers, and proceeds northwestward across the northern end of the Great\r\nManchurian Plain to Tsitsiha. At Tsitsiha, it joins the projected\r\nKinchow-Aigun line and proceeds together northwestward alongside the\r\nleft bank of the Nonni River as far as Nunkiang where it separates from\r\nthe other. Thence it resumes the northwesterly direction and proceeds\r\ninto the upper Nonni Valley until the headwater is reached. Then it\r\ncrosses the northern extremity of the Great Khingan Range to Moho,\r\nwhere it joins the terminus of the Dolon Nor-Moho line. This line is\r\nabout 600 miles long. About a quarter of this length runs on the plain,\r\nthe second quarter runs along the lower Nonni Valley, the third along\r\nthe Upper Valley, and the fourth runs in mountainous but gold-bearing\r\nregions, where only physical difficulties are to be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. The Tungchin-Korfen Line\r\n\r\nThis is the sixth line from the railway center. It also starts on the\r\nnorthern side of the Nonni-Sungari junction, and proceeds across the\r\nplain by the cities Chaotung and Tsingkang. After Tsingkang it crosses\r\nthe Tungkun River, proceeds to Hailun, and then, ascending the Tungkun\r\nValley, crosses the watershed of the Little Khingan Mountain. Thence it\r\ndescends into the Korfen Valley and proceeds by Chelu to Korfen on the\r\nright bank of the Amur River. This line covers a distance of 350 miles,\r\ntwo thirds of which run on comparatively level land and one third in\r\nmountainous district. This is the shortest line from Tungchin to the\r\nAmur River and the Russian territory on yonder side.\r\n\r\n\r\ng. The Tungchin-Yaoho Line\r\n\r\nThis is the seventh line that radiates from this railway center.\r\nIt starts from the northern side of the Nonni-Sungari junction and\r\ntraverses the plain on the left of the Sungari River by Chaochow, then\r\ncrosses the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the Hulan River to Hulan.\r\nAfter Hulan, it proceeds to Payen, Mulan, and Tungho, then crosses the\r\nSungari River to Sansing, now called Ilan. Thence it proceeds into the\r\nWokan Valley and crosses the watershed by Chihsingshitse and Takokai\r\ninto the Noloho Valley and passing by various villages and towns along\r\nthis river to Yaohohsien, ends at the junction of the Noloho and the\r\nUssuri River. This line covers a distance of 500 miles in very fertile\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nh. The Tungchin-Yenchi Line\r\n\r\nThis is the eighth line that radiates from this railway center. It\r\nstarts from the eastern side of the Nonni-Sungari junction and proceeds\r\nin a southeasterly direction on the right side of the Sungari River to\r\nFuyu or Petunai and various towns along the road on the same side of\r\nthe river until it comes across the Harbin-Talien Railway, then turns\r\naway from the road and proceeds eastward to Yushu and Wuchang. After\r\nWuchang, the line turning more southward, proceeds to Fengtechang and\r\nthen follows the same direction to Omu. At Omu, it crosses the Mutan\r\nRiver, then proceeds to Liangshuichuan and Shehtauho, where it joins\r\nthe Japanese Hweining-Kirin line and proceeds together to Yenchi. This\r\nline covers a length of about 330 miles through very rich agricultural\r\nand mineral country.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. The Tungchin-Changpeh Line\r\n\r\nThis is the ninth line that radiates from the Tungchin railway center.\r\nIt starts from the south side of the Nonni-Sungari junction and\r\nproceeds in a southeasterly direction across the plain to Nungan.\r\nAfter Nungan, it crosses the Itung River and proceeds continuously\r\nin the same direction across several branches of the same river to\r\nKiudaichan, where it joins the Changchun-Kirin line and proceeds\r\ntogether as far as Kirin. After Kirin, it goes its own way following\r\nthe right bank of the Sungari River in a southeasterly direction to\r\nthe junction of Lafaho River and turns southward along the same bank of\r\nthe Sungari to Huatien. After Huatien, it continues in the same course\r\nup to Toutaokiang, as far as Fusung, then turns southeastward into the\r\nSunghsiangho Valley and proceeds upward to the Changpeh Shan watershed\r\nby skirting the south side of the Celestial Lake, then turns southward\r\nfollowing the Aikiang River to Changpeh on the Korean frontier. This\r\nline covers a distance of about 330 miles. Some great difficulties are\r\nto be overcome in the last portion of the line where it crosses the\r\nChangpeh watershed.\r\n\r\n\r\nj. The Hulutao-Jehol-Peking Line\r\n\r\nWith this line I shall begin to deal with a new group of the\r\nNortheastern Railway System which will make Hulutao, the ice-free port\r\non the Liaotung Gulf as their center and terminus. This, the first\r\nline, starts from Hulutao and proceeds westward up the Shaho Valley\r\nto Sintaipienmen. Thence it crosses the mountainous district through\r\nHaiting, Mangniuyingtse, and Sanshihkiatse to Pingchuan, and continues\r\nin the same direction to Jehol or Chengteh. After Jehol, it proceeds\r\nby the old imperial highway to Lwanping, then turns southwestward to\r\nKupehkow where it penetrates the Great Wall. Thence it follows the same\r\nhighway through Miyun and Shunyi to Peking. This line covers a distance\r\nof about 270 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nk. The Hulutao-Kerulen Line\r\n\r\nThis is the second line of the Hulutao radiation. It starts from this\r\nseaport and proceeds northward through the mountainous region of\r\nJehol by Kienping and Chihfeng. Thence, the line follows the highway\r\nacross the Upper Valley of Liaoho to Chianchang, Sitoo, Takinkou, and\r\nLinsi. After Linsi, it proceeds up the Lukiako Valley and crosses the\r\nwatershed at the southern extremity of the Great Khingan Mountain,\r\nthrough Kanchumiao and Yufuchih. Then it proceeds to Payenbolak,\r\nUniket, and Khombukure where it joins with the Dolon Nor-Kerulen line\r\nand proceeds together to Kerulen. This line up to Khombukure covers a\r\ndistance of about 450 miles, tapping a very rich mineral, timber, and\r\nagricultural country.\r\n\r\n\r\nl. The Hulutao-Hailar Line\r\n\r\nThis, the third line, starts from Hulutao and proceeds by way of\r\nChinchow along the west side on the Talingho River to Yichow, where\r\nit crosses the Talingho to Chinghopienmen and Fowsin. After Fowsin,\r\nthe line goes northward to Suitung, thence, crossing the Siliaoho to\r\nKailu, it proceeds between the Great and Little Fish Lakes to Kinpan\r\nand Tachuan. Then it proceeds across the Great Khingan Mountain into\r\nthe Oman Valley and follows the same river to Hailar. This line\r\ncovers a distance of about 600 miles passing through rich mineral and\r\nagricultural land and virgin forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nm. The Hulutao-Antung Line\r\n\r\nThis, the fourth line, starts from Hulutao and proceeding\r\nnortheastward, follows the course of the projected Liaoho-Hulutao\r\nCanal, and then goes eastward to Newchwang and Haicheng. From there it\r\nproceeds southeastward to Sinmuchen, where it joins the Antung-Mukden\r\nline and proceeds together to Antung on the Korean border. This\r\nline covers a distance of about 220 miles. This together with the\r\nHulutao-Jehol-Peking line will make the shortest line from Antung and\r\nbeyond, i.e., Korea, to Peking.\r\n\r\n\r\nn. The Moho-Suiyuan Line\r\n\r\nWith this as the first I am going to deal with another group of lines\r\nin this system. These will be the circumferential lines which link up\r\nthe radii from the Tungchin center in two semicircles, the outer and\r\nthe inner. This Moho-Suiyuan line starts from Moho and proceeds along\r\nthe right bank of the Amur River to Ussuri, Omurh, Panga, Kaikukang,\r\nAnlo, and Woshimen. After this point, the river bends more southward\r\nand the line follows the same bend to Ankan, Chahayen, Wanghata, and\r\nHuma. From Huma, it proceeds to Sierhkenchi, Chila, Manchutun, Heiho,\r\nand Aigun where it meets the terminus of the Chinchow-Aigun line.\r\nAfter Aigun, the line turns more eastward to Homolerhchin, Chilirh,\r\nand Korfen where it meets the terminus of the Tungchin-Korfen line.\r\nThence it proceeds to Wuyun, Foshan, and Lopeh. After Lopeh, it goes to\r\nHokang at the junction of the Amur and Sungari. At this point, the line\r\ncrosses the Sungari River to Tungkiang and proceeds to Kaitsingkow,\r\nOtu, and Suiyuan where it ends. This line covers a distance of 900\r\nmiles running all its way through the gold-producing region.\r\n\r\n\r\no. The Huma-Chilalin or Shihwei Line\r\n\r\nThis is merely a branch of the Moho-Suiyuan line. It starts from Huma\r\nand follows the Kumara River passing by the Taleitse Gold Mine and\r\nWapalakow Gold Mine. Then it proceeds up the Kumara River in a westerly\r\nand southwesterly direction to its southern source and there it crosses\r\nthe watershed into the Halarh Valley, thence descending the valley to\r\nChilalin or Shihwei. This line covers a distance of about 320 miles\r\nrunning in an extremely rich gold district.\r\n\r\n\r\np. The Ussuri-Tumen-Yalu-Coast Line\r\n\r\nThis, the second line of the outer semicircle, starts by continuing the\r\nfirst line at Suiyuan, and proceeds along the left bank of the Ussuri\r\nRiver, passing Kaulan, Fuyeu, and Minkang, to Yaoho, where it meets\r\nthe terminus of the Tungchin-Yaoho line. From Yaoho, it runs parallel\r\nto the Russian Ussuri Railway on the east side of the river as far as\r\nFulin. After Fulin, it parts from the Russian line by turning westward\r\nfollowing the Mulingho River to Mishan on the northwestern corner of\r\nthe Hanka Lake. Thence it goes to Pinganchin, turns southward alongside\r\nthe boundary line and crosses the Harbin-Vladivostok line at Siusuifen\r\nStation to Tungning. After Tungning, it continues the same southward\r\ncourse alongside the boundary line to a point between Szetaukow and\r\nWutaukow, then turns westward to Hunchun, and northwestward to Yenchi\r\nwhere it meets the projected Japanese Hweining-Kirin line. From Yenchi,\r\nit follows the Japanese line to Holung, and proceeds southwestward by\r\nthe left side of the Tumen River across the watershed into the Yalu\r\nValley, where it meets the Tungchin-Changpeh line. After Changpeh it\r\nturns westward and northwestward following the right bank of the Yalu\r\nto Linkiang, thence southwestward, still following the right bank of\r\nthe Yalu, to Tsianhsien and then continues in the same direction, along\r\nthe Yalu bank, to Antung, where it meets the Antung-Mukden Railway.\r\nAfter Antung, it proceeds to Tatungkow at the mouth of the Yalu, thence\r\nalong the coast to Takushan and Chwangho, then westward through Situn\r\nand Pingfangtien to join the South Manchurian Railway at Wukiatun. This\r\nline covers a distance of 1,100 miles, which runs from end to end right\r\nalong the southeastern boundary of Manchuria.\r\n\r\n\r\nq. The Linkiang-Dolon Nor Line\r\n\r\nThis is the third line of the outer semicircle of the Tungchin railway\r\ncenter, and connects the radiating lines south of the center. It\r\nstarts from Linkiang at the southwestward turn of the Yalu River, and\r\nproceeds across the mountainous region passing by Tunghwa, Hingking,\r\nand Fushun, to Mukden, where it crosses the South Manchurian Railway.\r\nFrom Mukden, it goes together with the Peking-Mukden line as far\r\nas Sinmin, where it crosses the Tungchin-Hulutao line and proceeds\r\nnorthwestward through Sinlihtun to Fowsin. After Fowsin the line\r\nenters the hilly district of the upper Liaoho Valley, and proceeds to\r\nChihfeng, after passing through numerous small villages and camping\r\nplaces in this vast pasture. After Chihfeng the line proceeds through\r\nthe Yinho Valley by Sanchotien, Kungchuling, and Tachientse, to Famuku,\r\nthence follows the Tulakanho to Dolon Nor, covering a distance of about\r\n500 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nr. The Chikatobo-Sansing or Ilan Line\r\n\r\nThis is the first line of the inner semicircle which connects the\r\nradiating lines from the Tungchin railway center on the northeast. It\r\nstarts from Chikatobo on the upper reach of the Amur, and proceeds\r\neastward and southeastward through many valleys and mountains of the\r\nGreat Khingan Range to Nunkiang. After Nunkiang, it goes in a more\r\nsoutherly direction to Keshan, thence to Hailun, and then crosses the\r\nSungari to Sansing or Ilan. This line covers a distance of about 700\r\nmiles, passing through an agricultural and gold-producing country.\r\n\r\n\r\ns. The Sansing or Ilan-Kirin Line\r\n\r\nThis is the second line of the inner semicircle. It starts from Sansing\r\nand proceeds southwestward along the right bank of the Mutan River\r\nthrough Tauchan, Erchan, Sanchan, and Szuchan, to Chengtse where\r\nit crosses the Harbin-Vladivostok line. Then it goes to Ninguta,\r\nafter crossing over the Mutan River from right to the left bank.\r\nAfter Ninguta it proceeds southwestward passing through Wungcheng,\r\nLanchichan, Talachan, and Fungwangtien, to Omu. From Omu it joins the\r\nJapanese Hweining-Kirin line and proceeds westward to Kirin. This line\r\ncovers a distance of about 200 miles, along the fertile Mutan Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nt. The Kirin-Dolon Nor Line\r\n\r\nThis is the third line of the inner semicircle in the Tungchin\r\nsystem. It starts from Kirin and follows the old highway westward\r\nto Changchun where it meets the termini of the Chinese Eastern\r\nRailway from the north and the Japanese South Manchurian Railway\r\nfrom the south. After Changchun, it proceeds across the plain to\r\nShuangshan where it meets the Tungchin-Hulutao line and the Japanese\r\nSzupingkai-Chengkiatun-Taonan line. From Shuangshan, it crosses the\r\nLiao River to Liaoyuan, thence it traverses the vast plain, crossing\r\nthe Tungchin-Great Northern Port line and goes to Suitung where it\r\nmeets the Hulutao-Hailar line. After Suitung, it proceeds up the Liao\r\nValley where it comes across the Hulutao-Kerulen line and then crosses\r\nthe watershed to Dolon Nor where it ends. This line covers a distance\r\nof 500 miles. This completes the cobweb system of the projected\r\nNorth-Eastern Railway. The total length of this entire system is about\r\n9,000 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nThe Extension of the Northwestern Railway System\r\n\r\nThe Northwestern Railway System covers the region of Mongolia,\r\nSinkiang, and a part of Kansu, an area of 1,700,000 square miles. This\r\nterritory exceeds the area of the Argentine Republic by 600,000 square\r\nmiles. Argentina is now the greatest source of the world's meat supply,\r\nwhile the Mongolian pasture is not yet developed, owing to the lack\r\nof transportation facilities. As Argentina has superseded the United\r\nStates in supplying the world with meat, so the Mongolian pasture will\r\nsome day take the place of Argentina, when railways are developed and\r\ncattle raising is scientifically improved. Thus the construction of\r\nrailroads in this vast food-producing region is an urgent necessity\r\nas a means of relieving the world from food shortage. In the first\r\nprogram of this International Development Scheme, I proposed 7,000\r\nmiles of railways for this vast and fertile region, for the purpose\r\nof developing the Great Northern Port, and relieving the congested\r\npopulation of southeastern China. But this 7,000 miles of railways\r\nform merely a pioneer line. In order to develop this virgin continent\r\nproperly, more railways have to be constructed. Therefore in this plan,\r\nnamely, the Extension of the Northwestern Railway System, I propose the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n  a. The Dolon Nor-Kiakata line.\r\n  b. The Kalgan-Urga-Tannu Ola line.\r\n  c. The Suiyuan-Uliassutai-Kobdo line.\r\n  d. The Tsingpien-Tannu Ola line.\r\n  e. The Suchow-Kobdo line.\r\n  f. The Northwestern Frontier line.\r\n  g. The Tihwa or Urumochi-Ulankom line.\r\n  h. The Gaskhiun-Tannu Ola line.\r\n  i. The Uliassutai-Kiakata line.\r\n  j. The Chensi or Barkul-Urga line.\r\n  k. The Suchow-Urga line.\r\n  l. The Desert Junction-Kerulen line.\r\n  m. The Khobor-Kerulen-Chikatobo line.\r\n  n. The Wuyuan-Taonan line.\r\n  o. The Wuyuan-Dolon Nor line.\r\n  p. The Yenki-Ili line.\r\n  q. The Ili-Hotien line.\r\n  r. The Chensi-Kashgar line and its branches.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Dolon Nor-Kiakata Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Dolon Nor and proceeds in a northwesterly\r\ndirection, following the caravan road across the vast pasture to\r\nKhorkho, Kuoto, and Suliehto. After Suliehto, it crosses the boundary\r\nline into Outer Mongolia by the same road to Khoshentun, Lukuchelu,\r\nand Yangto. Thence it crosses the Kerulen River to Otukunkholato, and\r\nenters the hilly region where it crosses the Kerulen watershed and\r\nthe Chikoi watershed. The water from the Kerulen watershed flows into\r\nthe Amur, and thence into the Pacific Ocean, while the water from the\r\nChikoi watershed flows into Lake Baikal, and thence to the Arctic\r\nOcean. After crossing the Chikoi watershed, it follows a branch of the\r\nChikoi River to Kiakata. This line covers a distance of about 800 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Kalgan-Urga-Tannu Ola Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Kalgan at the Great Wall, and proceeds\r\nnorthwestward up the plateau, crosses a range of hills into the\r\nMongolian prairie, and goes to Mingan, Boroldshi, Ude, and Khobor,\r\nwhere it crosses the Dolon Nor-Urumochi trunk line. After Khobor, it\r\nproceeds across the vast and rich pasture of Mubulan, then proceeds in\r\na straight line through Mukata and Nalaiha to Urga. From Urga, it goes\r\ninto the hilly district crossing Selenga Valley to a point opposite\r\nthe southern end of Lake Kos Gol, and then turns northward across a\r\nrange of mountains to Khatkhyl on the southern shore of Kos Gol. After\r\nKhatkhyl, it skirts Kos Gol Lake along the western shore for some\r\ndistance, then turns northwestward and westward, following the course\r\nof the Khua Kem River to a point near its exit at the frontier line,\r\nthen turns southwestward up the Kemtshik Valley to its headwater,\r\npasses through Pakuoshwo, and ends at the boundary line between the\r\nRussian and Chinese territories. This line covers a distance of about\r\n1,700 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The Suiyuan-Uliassutai-Kobdo Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Suiyuan in the northwestern corner of Shansi,\r\nand proceeds in a northwesterly direction across the hilly country\r\ninto the Mongolian pasture to Tolibulyk, where it crosses the Great\r\nNorthern Port-Hami line, and the Great Eastern Port-Urga line. After\r\nTolibulyk, it proceeds in a straight line in the same direction passing\r\nthrough Barunsudshi to the capital of Tuchetu. Thence it continues\r\nin the same straight line northwestward to Gorida. After Gorida, it\r\nfollows the caravan road to Kolitikolik where it crosses the Great\r\nNorthern Port-Urumochi trunk line. From Kolitikolik, the line turns\r\nnorthwestward, then westward and proceeds across many streams and\r\nvalleys and passes by many small towns to Uliassutai. At Uliassutai,\r\nit crosses the B. Junction-Frontier branch of the Great Eastern\r\nPort-Urumochi line. After Uliassutai, the line proceeds westward\r\nfollowing the trade road, passes through Khuduku, Bogu, Durganor, and\r\nSakhibuluk to Kobdo. Thence the line turns northwestward to Khonga,\r\nUkha, and Clegei, then westward to Beleu and ends at the frontier. This\r\nline is about 1,500 miles long.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The Tsingpien-Tannu Ola Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Tsingpien at the Great Wall, on the northern\r\nborder of Shensi, proceeds through the Ordos country by Bonobalgasun,\r\nOrto, and Shinchao, and then crosses the Hoangho to Santaoho. From\r\nSantaoho, it proceeds across Charanarinula Mountain into Mongolian\r\nprairie in a northwesterly direction to Kurbansihata where it crosses\r\nthe Peking-Hami line, then it goes to Unikuto and Enkin, where it\r\ncrosses the Great Northern Port-Urumochi line. After Enkin, the\r\nline enters into a valley and watered district, proceeds northward\r\nto Karakorum, and then turns northwestward across various streams\r\nand valleys of the tributary of the Selenga River by Sabokatai and\r\nTsulimiau. After Tsulimiau, it proceeds in the same direction across\r\nthe Selenga River, follows its branch, the Telgir Morin River, up\r\nto its source and crosses the watershed into Lake Teri Nor. Then it\r\nfollows the outlet of the Teri Nor to the Khua Kem River, where it ends\r\nby joining the Kalgan Urga-Tannu Ola line. This line covers a distance\r\nof about 1,200 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. The Suchow-Kobdo Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Suchow in a northwesterly direction penetrating\r\nthe Great Wall at Chiennew, and proceeds to the coal field, about 150\r\nmiles from Suchow. Then it goes to Habirhaubuluk and Ilatoli. A short\r\nway from this place the line comes across the Peking-Hami line and\r\nthen proceeds to Balaktai. After this the line passes a bit of pure\r\ndesert to Timenchi. After entering the hilly and watered country it\r\nproceeds to Gaskhiu where it crosses the Great Northern Port-Urumochi\r\ntrunk line. After Gaskhiun, it proceeds to Wolanhutok, Tabateng, and\r\nTabutu where it joins the Kucheng and Kobdo highway and following it,\r\nproceeds to Kobdo, through Batokuntai and Sutai. Here the line ends,\r\ncovering a distance of about 700 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. The Northwestern Frontier Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Ili following the Urumochi-Ili line to Santai,\r\non the eastern side of Zairam Lake, then proceeds northeastward by\r\nitself to Tuszusai on the west side of Ebi Lake. After Tuszusai it\r\nproceeds to Toli where it crosses the Central Trunk line, that is,\r\nthe Great Eastern Port-Tarbogotai line. Thence it goes to Namukotai\r\nand Stolokaitai by passing through a vast forest and a rich coal\r\nfield. From Stolokaitai, the line follows the highway and proceeds\r\nto Chenghwaszu, the capital of Altai province. Thence it crosses a\r\nmountain range by the Urmocaitu Pass into the Kobdo Valley, and follows\r\nthe course of the Kobdo River to Beleu where it joins the Suiyuan-Kobdo\r\nline and proceeds to Clegei. From Clegei, it proceeds by itself to\r\nTabtu via Usungola and Ulamkom. At Tabtu, it joins the other line again\r\nand proceeds together to the Khua Kem River in the Tannu Ola district.\r\nIt then turns eastward ascending the river to the junction of the Bei\r\nKem and Khua Kem rivers, then starts again on its own course, following\r\nthe former river and proceeds up to its source in a northeasterly\r\ndirection ending at the frontier. This line covers a distance of about\r\n900 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\ng. The Tihwa or Urumochi-Ulankom Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Tihwa following the Dolon Nor trunk line to\r\nFowkang, then proceeds by its own route almost northward through\r\nChipichuan to Khorchute. From Khorchute, it turns northeastward and\r\nproceeds across a hilly district to Kaiche, then to Turhuta, where\r\nit crosses a branch line from Junction C. of the Great Northern\r\nPort-Urumochi line. After Turhuta, it turns northward, proceeds up the\r\nPakaningale Valley to Zehoshita, and then crosses the Tilikta Pass.\r\nThence it turns northeastward proceeding across the newly cultivated\r\ncountry to Kobdo. After Kobdo, it proceeds through a fertile plateau,\r\nby crossing many rivers and skirting many lakes to Ulankom, where it\r\nends by joining the Northwestern Frontier line. It covers a distance of\r\nabout 550 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nh. The Gaskhiun-Tannu Ola Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Gaskhiun and proceeds northeastward across a\r\nhilly and watered country through Hatonhutuk and Talangjoleu, to\r\nPornulu. After Pornulu, the line proceeds across the Sapkhyn Valley\r\nby Huchirtu and Porkho to Uliassutai where it meets the Suiyuan-Kobdo,\r\nand the Great Eastern Port-Uliassutai lines. After Uliassutai, the\r\nline proceeds northward to a quite new country by first crossing the\r\nheadwaters of Selenga, then the headwaters of the Tess River. In the\r\nTess Valley the line crosses a vast virgin forest. After emerging\r\nfrom this forest it proceeds northwestward across the watershed into\r\nthe Khua Kem Valley in Tannu Ola and ends by joining the Northwestern\r\nFrontier line. This line covers a distance of about 650 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. The Uliassutai-Kiakata Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Uliassutai and runs on the track of the\r\nGaskhiun-Tannu Ola line, until it reaches the Eder River, a branch of\r\nthe Selenga. Then, turning off eastward, it begins its own course and\r\nproceeds downward following the course of the Eder River, crossing\r\nthe Tsingpien-Tannu Ola line, to the junction of this river with the\r\nSelenga. There it joins the Kalgan-Urga-Tannu Ola line and proceeds\r\ntogether eastward in the common track for some distance until the other\r\nline turns southeastward, when this line turns northeastward following\r\nthe Selenga down to Kiakata. This line covers a distance of about 550\r\nmiles, running through a fertile valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nj. The Chensi or Barkul-Urga Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Chensi or Barkul and proceeds northeastward\r\nacross a cultivated region through Tutaku to Urkesiat. After Urkesiat,\r\nit crosses the Suchow-Kobdo line, then traverses the vast pasture on\r\nthe north side of the Gobi Desert to Suchi and Dalantura. Thence it\r\nturns more northward across the Great Eastern Port-Uliassutai line, and\r\nthe Dolon Nor-Urumochi line to Tashunhutuk. After this point the line\r\ncrosses the Suiyuan-Uliassutai line at Ologai and proceeds over the\r\nwatershed into the Selenga Valley where it crosses the Tsingpien-Tannu\r\nOla line at Sabokatai. From here it turns eastward across a hilly and\r\nwatered region to Urga. This line covers a distance of about 800 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nk. The Suchow-Urga Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Suchow and proceeds by Kinta to Maumu, and then\r\nfollows the Taoho or Edsina River, which waters this strip of oasis,\r\nto the lakes. Thence it crosses the Gobi Desert, where it meets the\r\ncrossing lines of the Peking-Hami and the Great Eastern Port-Uliassutai\r\nrailways and with them forms a common junction. From this junction it\r\nproceeds across desert and pasture lands to another railway crossing\r\nwhich is formed by the Suiyuan-Kobdo and Tsingpien-Tannu Ola lines,\r\nalso forming a common junction together. Thence it proceeds into\r\npasture land through Hatengtu and Tolik to Sanintalai, where it crosses\r\nthe Dolon Nor-Urumochi line. After Sanintalai, the line proceeds\r\nthrough Ulanhoshih and many other small towns and encampments to Urga.\r\nThis line covers a distance of about 700 miles. One third of this\r\nlength is through the desert and the other two thirds through watered\r\npasture land.\r\n\r\n\r\nl. The Desert Junction-Kerulen Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from the Desert Junction, proceeds northeastward to\r\nthe postural land and crosses the Tsingpien-Tannu Ola line south of\r\nUlan Nor Lake. Thence it proceeds to the Tuchetu Capital where it\r\ncrosses the Suiyuan-Kobdo line. After the Tuchetu Capital it goes\r\nacross a pasture to Junction A. From Junction A. it proceeds to\r\nUlanhutuk and Chientingche, then crosses the Kalgan-Tannu Ola line to\r\nZesenkhana. From Zesenkhana, the line follows the course of the Kerulen\r\nRiver down in a northeasterly direction to the city of Kerulen, where\r\nit crosses the Dolon Nor-Kerulen line, and meets the Kerulen-Tungchin\r\nline. This line covers a distance of about 800 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nm. The Khobor-Kerulen-Chikatobo Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Khobor, the crossing junction of the Dolon\r\nNor-Urumochi, and the Kalgan-Urga-Tannu Ola lines, and proceeds\r\nnortheastward across a vast pasture to Khoshentun, where it crosses\r\nthe Dolon Nor-Kiakata line. After Khoshentun, it proceeds in the same\r\ndirection across a similar pasture to Kerulen, where it crosses the\r\nDolon Nor-Kerulen line. Then it proceeds first along the right bank of\r\nthe Kerulen River, then crosses to the left side, and passes along the\r\nnorthwestern side of Hulan Lake. After Hulan Lake, the line crosses the\r\nChinese Eastern Railway, and the Arguna River, then proceeds along the\r\nright bank of the river to Chikatobo, where the line ends by joining\r\nthe Dolon Nor-Moho and the Chikatobo-Sansing lines. This line covers a\r\ndistance of about 600 miles. The first half of it runs on dry land and\r\nthe second half on watered land.\r\n\r\n\r\nn. The Wuyuan-Taonan Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Wuyuan at the northwest bend of the Hoangho\r\nand proceeds northeastward across the Sheiten Ula Mountain and\r\npasture to Tolibulyk, where it meets the crossing junction of three\r\nlines--the Peking-Hami line, the Suiyuan-Kobdo line, and the Great\r\nEastern Port-Urga line. From Tolibulyk the line proceeds continuously\r\nin the same direction across a pasture to Khobor where it meets the\r\ncrossing junction of the Dolon Nor-Urumochi and the Peking-Urga lines,\r\nand also the terminus of the Khobor-Kerulen line. After Khobor the\r\nline turns more eastward and runs across the Dolon Nor-Kiakata line\r\nmidway to Khombukure, where it crosses the Dolon Nor-Kerulen and the\r\nHulutao-Kerulen lines. From Khombukure the line proceeds to Dakmusuma,\r\nwhere it crosses the Dolon Nor-Moho line. Thence it goes eastward\r\nacross the Great Khingan Mountain to Tuchuan, then turns southeastward\r\nto Taonan, where it ends. This line covers a distance of about 900\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\no. The Wuyuan-Dolon Nor Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Wuyuan and proceeds northeastward across the\r\nSheiten Ula Mountain to Maomingan, where it crosses the Great Eastern\r\nPort-Urga line. Then it proceeds across the vast pasture and the\r\nSuiyuan-Kobdo line to Bombotu, where it passes over the Peking-Hami\r\nline. After Bombotu, the line turns eastward and proceeds across the\r\nKalgan-Urga-Tannu Ola line, then goes to Dolon Nor, where it ends by\r\njoining the Dolon Nor-Mukden-Linkiang line, which forms a direct route\r\nfrom the upper Hoangho Valley to the rich Liaoho Valley. This line\r\ncovers a distance of about 500 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\np. The Yenki-Ili Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Yenki or Karashar, and proceeds northwestward\r\nacross the mountain pass into the Ili Valley. It then follows the\r\nKunges River downward, in a westerly direction, traversing a most\r\nfertile valley, to Ining and Kuldja or Ili, the principal city of the\r\nIli district near the Russian border, where it joins the Ili-Urumochi\r\nline. This line covers a distance of about 400 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nq. The Ili-Hotien Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Ili or Kuldja, proceeds southward across\r\nthe Ili River, then eastward along the left side of the river and\r\nthen southeastward and southward to Bordai. From here it turns\r\nsouthwestward into Tekes Valley and proceeding upward crosses the\r\nTekes River to Tienchiao and then ascends the mountain pass. After\r\nthe mountain pass the line turns southeastward, traverses a vast coal\r\nfield and then turns southwestward to Shamudai, where it crosses the\r\nTurfan-Kashgar line. From Shamudai it turns southward across the\r\nfertile zone of the north side of the Tarim Valley, to Bastutakelak.\r\nThen it proceeds southwestward to Hotien passing by on the way many\r\nsmall settlements in the fertile zone of the Hotien River which flows\r\nacross the desert. At Hotien the line meets the Kashgar-Iden line.\r\nAfter Hotien the line proceeds upward to the highland south of the city\r\nand ends at the frontier. This line covers a distance of about 700\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nr. The Chensi-Kashgar Line and Its Branches\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Chensi and proceeds southwestward along the\r\nTienshan pasture through Yenanpoa, Shihkialoong, and Taolaitse\r\nto Chikoching, then along the Tienshan forest through Wutungkwo,\r\nTungyenchi, Siyenchi, and Olong to Sensien, where it crosses the\r\nCentral Trunk line. After Sensien it proceeds along the northern edge\r\nof the Tarim Desert through Lakesun City and Shehchuan to Hora, where\r\nit crosses the Cherchen-Koria line. From Hora the line proceeds along\r\nthe course of the Tarim River, passing by many new settlements, fertile\r\nregions, and virgin forests, to Bastutakelak, where it crosses the\r\nIli-Hotien line. Thence it goes through Pachu to Kashgar where it meets\r\nthe Urumochi-Iden line. After Kashgar it proceeds northwestward to\r\nthe frontier where it ends. Attached to this line are two branches.\r\nThe first branch proceeds from Hora southwestward through many oases\r\nto Cherchen. The second proceeds from Pachu southwestward along the\r\nYarkand River to Sache and then westward to Puli near the frontier.\r\nThis line including the branches covers a distance of about 1,600\r\nmiles. The total length of this entire system is about 16,000 miles.\r\nSee general map.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nThe Highland Railway System\r\n\r\nThis, the last part of my railway program, is the most difficult and\r\nmost expensive undertaking of its kind; consequently, it must be the\r\nleast remunerative of all the railway enterprises in China. So no\r\nwork should be attempted in this part until all the other parts are\r\nfully developed. But when all the other parts are well equipped with\r\nrailways then railway construction in this highland region will also be\r\nremunerative, despite the difficulties and the highly expensive work in\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe highland region consists of Tibet, Kokonor, and a part of\r\nSinkiang, Kansu, Szechwan, and Yunnan, an area of about 1,000,000\r\nsquare miles. Tibet is known to be the richest country in the world\r\nfor gold deposits. Furthermore the adjacent territories possess rich\r\nagricultural and pastural lands. This vast region is little known to\r\nthe outside world. The Chinese call Tibet \"the Western Treasury,\"\r\nfor, besides gold, there are other kinds of metals especially copper,\r\nin great quantities. Indeed the name of the Western Treasury is most\r\nappropriately applied to this unknown region. When the world's supply\r\nof precious metals are exhausted, we have to resort to this vast\r\nmineral bearing region for supply. So railways will be necessary at\r\nleast for mining purposes. I therefore propose the following lines:\r\n\r\n  a. The Lhasa-Lanchow line.\r\n  b. The Lhasa-Chengtu line.\r\n  c. The Lhasa-Tali-Cheli line.\r\n  d. The Lhasa-Taklongshong line.\r\n  e. The Lhasa-Yatung line.\r\n  f. The Lhasa-Laichiyaling line.\r\n  g. The Lhasa-Nohho line.\r\n  h. The Lhasa-Iden line.\r\n  i. The Lanchow-Chochiang line.\r\n  j. The Chengtu-Dzunsasak line.\r\n  k. The Ningyuan-Cherchen line.\r\n  l. The Chengtu-Menkong line.\r\n  m. The Chengtu-Yuankiang line.\r\n  n. The Suifu-Tali line.\r\n  o. The Suifu-Mengting line.\r\n  p. The Iden-Gortok line.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Lhasa-Lanchow Line\r\n\r\nThis is the most important line of this system for it connects the\r\ncapital city of Tibet--a vast secluded region with several millions of\r\npeople--with the central trunk line of the country. The route which\r\nit passes through is inhabitable and is already slightly inhabited\r\nin the region between the ends of the proposed line. So it will\r\nprobably be a paying line from the beginning. This line starts from\r\nLhasa, following the old imperial highway in a northward direction and\r\nproceeds by Talong to Yarh, which lies on the southeastern side of\r\nTengri Nor Lake. After Yarh, the line turns more eastward and proceeds\r\nacross the watershed from the Sanpo Valley to the Lukiang Valley by the\r\nShuangtsu Pass. Thence turning more eastward the line proceeds across\r\nthe headwater of the Lukiang to that of the Yangtze by passing many\r\nvalleys, streams, and mountain passes. Then it crosses the main body\r\nof the Upper Yangtze, which is here known as the Kinshakiang, over the\r\nHuhusair Bridge. After crossing the bridge, it turns southeastward,\r\nthen eastward across the Yangtze Valley into the Hoangho Valley, where\r\nit passes through many small towns and encampments into the Starry Sea\r\nregion. At the Starry Sea, the line passes between the lakes of Oring\r\nNor and Tsaring Nor. Thence it turns northeastward across the southeast\r\nvalley of the Zaidam region, and returns into the Hoangho Valley again.\r\nThen it proceeds through Katolapo and various towns to Dangar, now\r\ncalled Hwangyuan, situated near the border between Kansu and Kokonor.\r\nAfter Dangar, the line turns southeastward following the course of the\r\nSining River, proceeds downward through a very rich valley and passes\r\nthrough Sining, Nienpai, and hundreds of small towns and villages to\r\nLanchow. This line covers a distance of 1,100 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Lhasa-Chengtu Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Lhasa and proceeds northeastward on the former\r\nimperial highway by Teking and Nanmo to Motsukungchia. Thence it turns\r\nsoutheastward and northeastward to Giamda. From Giamda, the line turns\r\nnorthward, then northeastward where it proceeds through the Tolala Pass\r\nto Lhari. After Lhari the line goes in an easterly direction and passes\r\nPianpa, Shihtuh, and many small towns to Lolongchong. Thence it crosses\r\nthe Lukiang by the Kayu Bridge and then turns northeastward to Kinda\r\nand Chiamdo. After Chiamdo, the line instead of following the imperial\r\nhighway southeastward to Batang, turns northeastward, following another\r\ntrade route, and proceeds to Payung at the northwestern corner of\r\nSzechwan. From Payung, it proceeds across the Kinshakiang over the\r\nbridge near Sawusantusze. The line then turns southeastward, enters the\r\nIchu Valley and proceeds downward to Kantzu on the Yalung River. Thence\r\nit proceeds to Chango and Yinker, to Badi on the Great Golden River,\r\nand Mongan on the Little Golden River. After Mongan, the line goes\r\nthrough the Balan Pass to Kwanhsien, and entering the Chengtu Plain,\r\nreaches Chengtu by Pihsien. This line covers a distance of about 1,000\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The Lhasa-Tali-Cheli Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Lhasa by the same track as the Lhasa-Chengtu\r\nline as far as Giamda. From Giamda, it proceeds by its own track\r\nsoutheastward, following a branch of the Sanpo River to Yulu, where\r\nthis branch joins its main stream. After Yulu, it follows the left\r\nbank of the Sanpo River passing by Kongposaga to Timchao. From\r\nTimchao, the line turns away from the Sanpo River and proceeds in an\r\neastward direction to Timchong city, Ikung, Kuba, and Shuachong. After\r\nShuachong, the line proceeds southeastward to Lima, thence eastward\r\nto Menkong on the Lukiang. From Menkong, the line turns southward and\r\ngoes along the right bank of the Lukiang passing Samotung to Tantau.\r\nThen crossing the Lukiang, it proceeds across the watershed through\r\nGaiwa village to the Lantsang (or Mekong) River, and to Hsiaoweisi\r\nbeyond it. After Hsiaoweisi, it follows the river bank to the Chenghsin\r\nCopper Mine, thence it turns away from the river and proceeds by Hosi,\r\nErhyuan, Tengchow, and Shangkwang to Tali. From Tali, the line proceeds\r\nto Hsiakwang, Fengyi, Menghwa, and then meets the Lantsang River again\r\nat Paotien. Thence it follows the left bank southward right through to\r\nCheli, where it ends. This line covers a distance of 900 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The Lhasa-Taklongshong Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Lhasa and proceeds southward by way of Teking\r\nto the Sanpo River where turning eastward it follows the left bank of\r\nthe river to Sakorshong. After crossing the Sanpo River to Chetang,\r\nit proceeds southward by Chikablung, Menchona, Tawang, Dhirangjong\r\nto Taklongshong and continues farther on until it reaches the Assam\r\nfrontier. This line covers a distance of 200 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. The Lhasa-Yatung Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Lhasa and proceeds southwestward by Chashih\r\nfollowing the former imperial highway by Yitang and Kiangli to Chushui.\r\nAt Chushui, it crosses to Sanpo River over the Mulih Bridge to Chakamo\r\non the south side, thence to Tamalung, Paiti, Tabolung, and Nagartse.\r\nAfter Nagartse, the line turns westward to Jungku, Lhaling, and\r\nShachia. At Shachia, the line leaves the former imperial highway and\r\nturns southwestward again and proceeds via Kula to Yatung at the Sikkim\r\nborder. This line covers a distance of 250 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. The Lhasa-Laichiyaling Line and Branches\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Lhasa and proceeds northwestward by Chashih\r\nfollowing the former imperial road to Little Taking, and westward to\r\nYangpachin and Sangtolohai. Thence turning southwestward, it proceeds\r\nto Namaling and Tangto, and crosses the Sanpo River at Lhaku. After\r\nLhaku, the line turns westward to Shigatse, the second important city\r\nin Tibet whence it proceeds in the same direction to Chashihkang,\r\nPangcholing, and Lhatse all on the right side of the Sanpo River. From\r\nLhatse, a branch line starts southwestward via Chayakor and Dingri\r\nto Niehlamuh on the Nepal border. The main line, however, crosses to\r\nthe left side of the Sanpo River and proceeds on the same highway via\r\nNabringtaka to Tadum where another branch line proceeds southwestward\r\nto the Nepal border. The main line continues northwestward via\r\nTamusa and Choshan to Gartok, thence turning westward it proceeds to\r\nLaichiyaling on the Sutlej River and ends on the Indian border. This\r\nline, including the two branches, covers a distance of 850 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\ng. The Lhasa-Nohho Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Lhasa and runs in the same track as line (f) to\r\nSangtolohai where it proceeds by its own line northwestward to Teching,\r\nSangchashong, and Taktung. Thence, it enters into the richest gold\r\nfield in Tibet and through Wengpo, Tulakpa, Kwangkwei, and Ikar reaches\r\nNohho, where the line ends. It covers a distance of 700 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nh. The Lhasa-Iden Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Lhasa, following the common track of lines (f)\r\nand (g) to the southwestern corner of Tengri Lake, whence it proceeds\r\nby its own track northwestward by Lungmajing, Tipoktolo and four or\r\nfive other small places to Sari. After Sari, the line penetrates a vast\r\ntract of uninhabited land to Pakar and Suketi. Thence crossing the\r\nmountain passes and descending from the highland to the Tarim Basin\r\nthrough Sorkek to Yasulakun, the line joins the Cherchen-Iden railway\r\nof the Northwestern System and proceeds on the same track to Iden. This\r\nline covers a distance of 700 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. The Lanchow-Chochiang Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Lanchow, on the same track of the Lhasa-Lanchow\r\nline as far as the southeastern corner of the Lake Kokonor. Thence\r\nit proceeds on its own track by skirting along the southern shore of\r\nLake Kokonor to Dulankit, where it turns southwestward to Dzunsasak.\r\nFrom Dzunsasak, the line proceeds in a westerly course along the\r\nsouthern side of the Zaidam Swamp, and passes Tunyueh, Halori, and\r\nGolmot to Hatikair. After Hatikair, the line turns northwestward\r\nby Baipa, Nolinjoha, to Orsinte. Thence turning more northward, it\r\nproceeds across the mountain range by Tsesinvitusuik and Tuntunomik to\r\nChochiang, where it ends by joining the Ansi-Iden and Chochiang-Koria\r\nlines, covering a distance of 700 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nj. The Chengtu-Dzunsasak Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Chengtu and proceeds to Kwanhsien on the track\r\nof the Lhasa-Chengtu line, thence northward on its own track by\r\nWenchuan, to Mauchow. Then, it proceeds northwestward following the\r\ncourse of the Minkiang to Sungpan. After Sungpan, it ascends the Min\r\nValley passing Tungpi to Shangleyao, where it crosses the watershed\r\nfrom the Yangtze River side to that of the Hoangho. Thence the line\r\nproceeds to Orguseri, and following a branch of the Hoangho to the\r\nnorthwestern turn of its main stream, it proceeds along its right\r\nbank via Chahuntsin to Peilelachabu. There it crosses the Hoangho\r\nto the northwest turn of the old imperial road, where it joins the\r\nLhasa-Lanchow line and proceeds as far as Lanipar. Then turning\r\nnorthwestward, it proceeds by its own line to Dzunsasak, where it ends\r\nby joining the Lanchow-Chochiang line. This line covers a distance of\r\n650 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nk. The Ningyuan-Cherchen Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Ningyuan and proceeds in a northwestward\r\ndirection via Hwaiyuanchen to the Yalungkiang. Then it ascends along\r\nthe left side of that river to Yakiang, and crossing to the right side\r\nof that river it proceeds by the old post road to Siolo, where it\r\nturns away from the river and follows the same post road to Litang.\r\nFrom Litang it proceeds in the same direction but follows another\r\nroad to Kangtu, on the left side of the Kinshakiang. Following the\r\nsame side of the river, it proceeds to Sawusantusze, where it crosses\r\nthe Lhasa-Chengtu line. After Sawusantusze, the line continues in\r\nthe same direction and follows the same side of the Kinshakiang via\r\nTashigompa, to the Huhusair Bridge, where it crosses the Lhasa-Lanchow\r\nline. Then following a northern branch of the Kinshakiang to its\r\nsource and crossing the watershed, it proceeds along the caravan road\r\nby Hsinszukiang and Olokung to Cherchen, where it ends, covering a\r\ndistance of about 1,350 miles. This is the longest line of this system.\r\n\r\n\r\nl. The Chengtu-Menkong Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Chengtu and proceeds southwestward by Shuangliu,\r\nHsintsin, Mingshan, to Yachow. From Yachow, it turns northwestward\r\nand proceeds to Tienchuan, then westward to Tatsienlu, Tunyolo, and\r\nLitang. After Litang, the line proceeds southwestward through Batang\r\nand Yakalo, to Menkong, covering a distance of about 400 miles of very\r\nmountainous country.\r\n\r\n\r\nm. The Chengtu-Yuankiang Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Chengtu on the same track of the Chengtu-Menkong\r\nline, proceeds to Yachow and thence by its own track in the same\r\ndirection via Jungching, to Tsingliu. After Tsingliu, the line proceeds\r\nsouthward through Yuehsi to Ningyuan, where it meets the head of the\r\nNingyuan-Cherchen line. After Ningyuan, it goes to Kwaili, then crosses\r\nthe Kinshakiang to Yunnanfu where it crosses the Canton-Tali line.\r\nFrom Yunnanfu, it proceeds along the west side of the Kunming Lake to\r\nKunyang, and through Hsinshing, Hsingo, to Yuankiang, where the line\r\nends by joining the Canton-Szemo line. It covers a distance of about\r\n600 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nn. The Suifu-Tali Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Suifu and proceeds along the left bank of the\r\nYangtze River to Pingshan and Lupo. After Lupo, it turns away from the\r\nriver in a southwesterly direction and scales the Taliangshan Mountains\r\nto Ningyuan, where it crosses the Chengtu-Yuankiang line and meets the\r\ntermini of the Canton-Ningyuan line and the Ningyuan-Cherchen line.\r\nThence continuing in the same direction, it crosses the Yalungkiang\r\nto Yenyuan and Yungpeh. After Yungpeh, the line turns more southward,\r\nacross the Kinshakiang to Sincheng and thence to Tali, where it ends\r\nby meeting the Canton-Tali line and the Lhasa-Tali line. It covers a\r\ndistance of about 400 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\no. The Suifu-Mengting Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Suifu on the same track as the Suifu-Tali\r\nline as far as Lupo. From Lupo, it goes on its own track across the\r\nYangtze River here known as the Kinshakiang, and follows the right\r\nside of that river upward to its southward bend where it crosses the\r\nChengtu-Yuankiang line, to Yuanmow. From Yuanmow, it proceeds to\r\nTsuyung, where it crosses the Canton-Tali line, thence to Kingtung.\r\nAfter Kingtung, it proceeds southwestward across the Lantsangkiang or\r\nMekong River, to Yunchow, thence turning southwestward, it follows a\r\nbranch of the Lukiang River to Mengting and ends on the frontier. This\r\nline covers a distance of about 500 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\np. The Iden-Gartok Line\r\n\r\nThis line starts from Iden, and proceeds southward along the Keriya\r\nRiver to Polu, thence following the caravan road up the highland to\r\nKuluk. From Kuluk, it proceeds southwestward via Alasa and Tunglong\r\nto Nohho, where it meets the terminus of the Lhasa-Nohho line. After\r\nNohho, it skirts around the eastern end of the Noh-tso-Lake to Rudok\r\nand proceeds southwestward to Demchok, on the Indus River. From\r\nDemchok, it proceeds southeastward following the Indus River up to\r\nGartok, where it ends by joining the Lhasa-Laichiyaling line. This line\r\ncovers a distance of about 500 miles. This highland system totals about\r\n11,000 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nThe Establishment of Locomotive and Car Factories\r\n\r\nThe railways projected in the Fourth Program will total about 62,000\r\nmiles; and those in the First and the Third Programs about 14,000\r\nmiles. Besides these, there will be double tracks in the various trunk\r\nlines, which will make up a grand total of no less than 100,000 miles,\r\nas stated in the preliminary part of these programs. With this 100,000\r\nmiles of railways to be constructed in the coming ten years, the\r\ndemands for locomotives and cars will be tremendous. The factories of\r\nthe world will be unable to supply them, especially at this juncture\r\nof reconstruction after the great world war. So the establishment\r\nof locomotive and car factories in China to supply our own demands\r\nof railway equipment will be a necessary as well as a profitable\r\nundertaking. China possesses unlimited supplies of raw materials and\r\ncheap labor. What we need for establishing such factories is foreign\r\ncapital and experts. What amount of capital should be invested in this\r\nproject, I have to leave to experts to decide.\r\n\r\nI suggest that four large factories should be started simultaneously at\r\nthe beginning--two on the coast and two on the Yangtze. Of those on the\r\ncoast, one should be at the Great Northern Port, and the other at the\r\nGreat Southern Port--Canton. Of those on the Yangtze, one should be at\r\nNanking and the other at Hankow. All four are in centers of both land\r\nand water communication, where skilled labor can easily be obtained.\r\nThey are also near our iron and coal fields. Besides these four great\r\nfactories, others should be established at suitable centers of iron and\r\ncoal fields when our railways will be more developed.\r\n\r\nAll the factories should be under one central control. The locomotives\r\nand cars of our future railways should be standardized so as to make\r\npossible the interchange of parts of machinery and equipment. We should\r\nalso adopt the standard gauge, that is, the 4 feet 8½ inch gauge which\r\nhas been adopted by most of the railways of the world. In fact, almost\r\nall the railways hitherto built in China are of this gauge. The purpose\r\nof the proposed standardization is to secure the highest efficiency as\r\nwell as the greatest economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM V\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding four programs, I dealt exclusively with the\r\ndevelopment of the key and basic industries. In this one, I am going to\r\ndeal with the development of the _main_ group of industries which need\r\nforeign help. By the main group of industries, I mean those industries\r\nwhich provide every individual and family with the necessaries and\r\ncomforts of life. Of course, when the key and basic industries are\r\ndeveloped, the various other industries will spontaneously spring up\r\nall over the country, in a very short time. This had been the case in\r\nEurope and America after the industrial revolution. The development of\r\nthe key and the basic industries will give plenty of work to the people\r\nand will raise their wages as well as their standard of living. When\r\nwages are high, the price for necessaries and comforts of life will\r\nalso be increased. So the rise in wages will be accompanied by the rise\r\nin the cost of living. Therefore, the aim of the development of some of\r\nthe main group of industries is to help reduce the high cost of living\r\nwhen China is in the process of international development, by giving\r\nto the majority of the people plenty of the essentials and comforts of\r\nlife as well as higher wages.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly thought that China is the cheapest country to live\r\nin. This is a misconception owing to the common notion of measuring\r\neverything by the value of money. If we measure the cost of living\r\nby the value of labor then it will be found that China is the most\r\nexpensive country for a common worker to live in. A Chinese coolie, a\r\nmuscular worker, has to work 14 to 16 hours a day in order to earn a\r\nbare subsistence. A clerk in a shop, or a teacher in a village school\r\ncannot earn more than a hundred dollars a year. And the farmers after\r\npaying their rents and exchanging for a few articles of need with\r\ntheir produce have to live from hand to mouth. Labor is very cheap\r\nand plentiful but food and commodities of life are just enough to go\r\nround for the great multitude of the four hundred millions in China in\r\nan ordinary good year. In a bad year, a great number succumb to want\r\nand starvation. This miserable condition among the Chinese proletariat\r\nis due to the non-development of the country, the crude methods of\r\nproduction and the wastefulness of labor. The radical cure for all\r\nthis is industrial development by foreign capital and experts for the\r\nbenefit of the whole nation. Europe and America are a hundred years\r\nahead of us in industrial development; so in order to catch up in a\r\nvery short time we have to use their capital, mainly their machinery.\r\nIf foreign capital cannot be gotten, we will have to get at least their\r\nexperts and inventors to make for us our own machinery. In any case,\r\nwe must use machinery to assist our enormous man-power to develop our\r\nunlimited resources.\r\n\r\nIn modern civilization, the material essentials of life are five,\r\nnamely: food, clothing, shelter, means of locomotion, and the printed\r\npage. Accordingly I will formulate this program as follows:\r\n\r\n    I. The Food Industry.\r\n   II. The Clothing Industry.\r\n  III. The Housing Industry.\r\n   IV. The Motoring Industry.\r\n    V. The Printing Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nThe Food Industry\r\n\r\nThe food industry should be treated under the following headings:\r\n\r\n  a. The Production of Food.\r\n  b. The Storage and Transportation of Food.\r\n  c. The Preparation and Preservation of Food.\r\n  d. The Distribution and Exportation of Food.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Production of Food\r\n\r\nHuman foods are derived from three sources: the land, the sea and the\r\nair. By far the most important and greatest in quantity consumed is\r\naerial food of which oxygen is the most vital element. But this aerial\r\nfood is abundantly provided by nature, and no human labor is needed for\r\nits production except that which is occasionally needed for the airman\r\nand the submariner. So this food is free to all. It is not necessary\r\nfor us to discuss it here. The production of food from the sea which I\r\nhave already touched upon when I dealt with the construction of fishing\r\nharbors and the building of fishing crafts, will also be left out here.\r\nIt is the specific industries in the production of food from land,\r\nwhich need foreign help that are to be discussed here.\r\n\r\nChina is an agricultural country. About four-fifths of its population\r\nis occupied in the work of producing food. The Chinese farmer is very\r\nskillful in intensive cultivation. He can make the land yield to its\r\nutmost capacity. But vast tracts of arable lands are lying waste in\r\nthickly populated districts for one cause or other. Some are due to\r\nlack of water, some to too much of it and some to the \"dog in the\r\nmanger\" system,--the holding up of arable land by speculators and land\r\nsharks for higher rents and prices.\r\n\r\nThe land of the eighteen provinces alone is at present supporting\r\na population of four hundred millions. Yet there is still room for\r\ndevelopment which can make this same area of land yield more food if\r\nthe waste land be brought under cultivation, and the already cultivated\r\nland be improved by modern machinery and scientific methods. The\r\nfarmers must be protected and encouraged by liberal land laws by which\r\nthey can duly reap the fruits of their own labor.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the production of food in our international development\r\nscheme, two necessary undertakings should be carried out which will be\r\nprofitable at the same time.\r\n\r\n    (1) A scientific survey of the land.\r\n\r\n    (2) The establishment of factories for manufacturing\r\n        agricultural machinery and implements.\r\n\r\n(1) A scientific survey of the land. China has never been\r\nscientifically surveyed and mapped out. The administration of land\r\nis in the most chaotic state and the taxation of land is in great\r\nconfusion, thus causing great hardships on the poor peasants and\r\nfarmers. So, under any circumstance, the survey of land is the first\r\nduty of the government to execute. But this could not be done without\r\nforeign help, owing to lack of funds and experts. Therefore, I suggest\r\nthat this work be taken up by an international organization. This\r\norganization should provide the expenses of the work by a loan, and\r\nshould carry out the work with the required number of experts and\r\nequipment. How much will be the expenses for the survey and what is the\r\namount of time required and how large an organization is sufficient to\r\ncarry on the work, and whether aerial survey by aeroplanes be practical\r\nfor this work are questions which I shall leave to experts to decide.\r\n\r\nWhen the topographical survey is going on a geological survey may\r\nbe carried out at the same time so as to economize expenses. When\r\nthe survey work is done and the land of each province is minutely\r\nmapped out, we shall be able to readjust the taxation of the already\r\ncultivated and improved land. As regards the waste and uncultivated\r\nlands we shall be able to determine whether they are suitable for\r\nagriculture, for pasture, for forestry, or for mining. In this way, we\r\ncan estimate their value and lease them out to the users for whatever\r\nproduction that is most suitable. The surplus tax of the cultivated\r\nland and the proceeds of waste land will be for the payment of the\r\ninterest and principal of the foreign loan. Besides the eighteen\r\nprovinces, we have a vast extent of agricultural and pastural lands\r\nin Manchuria, Mongolia, and Sinkiang, and a vast extent of pastural\r\nland in Tibet and Kokonor. They will have to be developed by extensive\r\ncultivation under the colonization scheme, which is alluded to in the\r\nfirst program.\r\n\r\n(2) The establishment of factories for manufacturing agricultural\r\nmachinery and implements. When the waste land is reclaimed, cultivated\r\nland improved and waste labor set to work on the land, the demands for\r\nagricultural machinery and implements will be very great. As we have\r\ncheap labor and plenty of iron and coal, it is better and cheaper for\r\nus to manufacture than to import the implements and machinery. For\r\nthis purpose, much capital should be invested, and factories should be\r\nput up in industrial centers or in the neighborhood of iron and coal\r\nfields, where labor and material could be easily found.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Storage and Transportation of Food\r\n\r\nThe most important foodstuff to be stored and transported is grain.\r\nUnder the present Chinese method, the storage of grain is most\r\nwasteful for if kept in large quantities it is often destroyed by\r\ninsects or damaged by weather. It is only in small quantities and by\r\ngreat and constant care that grains can be preserved for a certain\r\nperiod of time. And the transportation of grains is also most expensive\r\nfor the work is mostly done on man's shoulders. When the grains reach\r\nthe waterway it is carried in a most makeshift way, without the least\r\nsemblance of system. If the method of storing and transporting of grain\r\nbe improved, a great economic saving could be accomplished. I propose\r\nthat a chain of grain elevators be built all over the country and a\r\nspecial transport fleet be equipped all along the waterways by this\r\nInternational Development Organization. What will be the capital for\r\nthis project and where the elevators should be situated have yet to be\r\ninvestigated by experts.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The Preparation and Preservation of Food\r\n\r\nHitherto the preparation of food is entirely by hand with a few\r\nprimitive implements. The preservation of food is either by salt or sun\r\nheat. Mills and cannery method are scarcely known. I suggest that a\r\nsystem of rice mills should be constructed in all the large cities and\r\ntowns in the Yangtze Valley and South China where rice is the staple\r\nfood. Flour mills should be put up in all large cities and towns north\r\nof the Yangtze Valley, where wheat, oats, and cereals other than rice\r\nare the staple food. All these mills should be under one central\r\nmanagement so as to produce the best economic results. What amount of\r\ncapital should be invested in this mill system by this international\r\ndevelopment scheme should be subjected to detailed investigation.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the preservation of food, fruits, meats and fishes should\r\nbe preserved by canning or by refrigeration. If the canning industry\r\nis developed there will be created a great demand for tinplates.\r\nTherefore the establishment of tinplate factories will be necessary and\r\nalso profitable. Such factories should be situated near the iron and\r\ntin fields. There are many localities in South China where tin, iron,\r\nand coal are situated near each other, thus providing ready materials\r\nfor the factories. The tinplate factories and the canneries should be\r\ncombined into one enterprise so as to secure best economic results.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The Distribution and Exportation of Food\r\n\r\nIn ordinary good years, China never lacks food. There is a common\r\nsaying in China that \"One year's tilling will provide three years'\r\nwants.\" In the richer sections of the country, the people generally\r\nreserve three or four years' food supply in order to combat a bad\r\nyear. But when China is developed and organized as an economic whole,\r\none year's food reserve should be kept in the country for the use of\r\nthe local people and the surplus should be sent out to the industrial\r\ncenters. As the storage and transportation of food will be under a\r\ncentral management so the distribution and exportation of food should\r\nbe under the same charge. All surplus grains of a country district\r\nshould be sent to the nearest town for storage and each town or city\r\nshould store one year's food. All the staple food should be sold only\r\nat cost price to the inhabitants according to their number, by the\r\ndistributing department. And the surplus food should be exported to\r\nforeign countries where it is wanted and where the highest price can be\r\nobtained by the export department under the central management. Thus\r\nthe surplus food will not be wasted as hitherto under the prohibition\r\nlaw. The proceeds of this export will surely amount to a huge sum\r\nwhich will be used in the payment of the interest and principal of the\r\nforeign loan invested in this undertaking.\r\n\r\nWe cannot complete this part of the food industry without giving\r\nspecial consideration to the Tea and Soya industries. The former, as a\r\nbeverage, is well known throughout and used by the civilized world and\r\nthe latter is just beginning to be realized as an important foodstuff\r\nby the scientists and food administrators. Tea, the most healthy and\r\ndelicious beverage of mankind, is produced in China. Its cultivation\r\nand preparation form one of the most important industries of the\r\ncountry. Once China was the only country that supplied the world with\r\ntea. Now, China's tea trade has been wrested away from her by India\r\nand Japan. But the quality of the Chinese tea is still unequalled.\r\nThe Indian tea contains too much tannic acid, and the Japanese tea\r\nlacks the flavor which the Chinese tea possesses. The best tea is only\r\nobtainable in China--the native land of tea. China lost her tea trade\r\nowing to the high cost of its production. The high cost of production\r\nis caused by the inland tax as well as the export duty and by the old\r\nmethods of cultivation and preparation. If the tax and duty are done\r\naway with and new methods introduced, China can recover her former\r\nposition in this trade easily. In this International Development\r\nScheme, I suggest that a system of modern factories for the preparation\r\nof tea should be established in all the tea districts, so that the tea\r\nshould be prepared by machinery instead of, as hitherto, by hand. Thus\r\nthe cost of production can be greatly reduced and the quality improved.\r\nAs the world's demand for tea is daily increasing and will be more so\r\nby a dry United States of America, a project to supply cheaper and\r\nbetter tea will surely be a profitable one.\r\n\r\nSoya bean as a meat substitute was discovered by the Chinese and used\r\nby the Chinese and the Japanese as a staple food for many thousands of\r\nyears. As meat shortage has been keenly felt in carnivorous countries\r\nat present, a solution must be found to relieve it. For this reason\r\nI suggest that in this International Development Scheme we should\r\nintroduce this artificial meat, milk, butter and cheese to Europe and\r\nAmerica, by establishing a system of soya bean factories in all the\r\nlarge cities of those countries, so as to provide cheap nitrogenous\r\nfood to the western people. Modern factories should also be established\r\nin China to replace those old and expensive methods of production by\r\nhand, so as to procure better economic results as well as to produce\r\nbetter commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nThe Clothing Industry\r\n\r\nThe principal materials for clothes are silk, linen, cotton, wool and\r\nanimal skins. I shall accordingly deal with them under the following\r\nheadings:\r\n\r\n  a. The Silk Industry.\r\n  b. The Linen Industry.\r\n  c. The Cotton Industry.\r\n  d. The Woolen Industry.\r\n  e. The Leather Industry.\r\n  f. The Manufacturing of Clothing Machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Silk Industry\r\n\r\nSilk is a Chinese discovery and was used as a material for clothes for\r\nmany thousands of years before the Christian Era. It is one of the\r\nimportant national industries of China. Up to recent times, China was\r\nthe only country that supplied silk to the world. But now this dominant\r\ntrade has been taken away from China by Japan, Italy and France,\r\nbecause those countries have adopted scientific methods for silk\r\nculture and manufacture, while China still uses the same old methods of\r\nmany thousand years ago. As the world's demand for silk is increasing\r\ndaily, the improvement of the culture and manufacture of silk will\r\nbe a very profitable undertaking. In this International Development\r\nScheme, I suggest first that scientific bureaus be established in every\r\nsilk district to give directions to the farmers and to provide healthy\r\nsilk-worm eggs. These bureaus should be under central control. At the\r\nsame time, they will act as collecting stations for cocoons so as to\r\nsecure a fair price for the farmers. Secondly, silk filiatures with\r\nup-to-date machinery should be established in suitable districts to\r\nreel the silk for home as well as for foreign consumption. And lastly,\r\nmodern factories should be put up for manufacturing silk for both home\r\nand foreign markets. All silk filiatures and factories should be under\r\na single national control and will be financed with foreign capital\r\nand supervised by experts to secure the best economic results and to\r\nproduce better and cheaper commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Linen Industry\r\n\r\nThis is an old Chinese industry. In southern China there is produced\r\na kind of very fine linen in the form of ramie, known as China-grass.\r\nThis fiber if treated by modern methods and machinery becomes almost as\r\nfine and glossy as silk. But in China, so far as I know, there is not\r\nyet such new method and machinery for the manufacturing of this linen.\r\nThe famous Chinese grass-cloth is manufactured by the old method of\r\nhand-looms. I propose that new methods and machinery be introduced into\r\nChina by this International Development Organization to manufacture\r\nthis linen. A system of modern factories should be established all over\r\nthe ramie-producing districts in South China where raw materials and\r\nlabor are obtainable.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The Cotton Industry\r\n\r\nCotton is a foreign product which was introduced into China centuries\r\nago. It became a very important Chinese industry during the hand-loom\r\nage. But after the import of foreign cotton goods into China, this\r\nnative handicraft industry was gradually killed by the foreign trade.\r\nSo, great quantities of raw cotton are exported and finished cotton\r\ngoods are imported in large quantities into China. What an anomaly\r\nwhen we consider the enormous, cheap labor in China. However a few\r\ncotton mills have been started recently in treaty ports which have made\r\nenormous profits. It is reported that during the last two or three\r\nyears most of the Shanghai cotton mills declared a dividend of 100 per\r\ncent and some even 200 per cent! The demand for cotton goods in China\r\nis very great but the supply falls short. It is necessary to put up\r\nmore mills in China for cotton manufacturing. Therefore, I suggest\r\nin this International Development Scheme to put up a system of large\r\ncotton mills all over the cotton-producing districts under one central\r\nnational control. Thus the best economic results will be obtained and\r\ncotton goods can be supplied to the people at a lower cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The Woolen Industry\r\n\r\nAlthough the whole of Northwestern China--about two-thirds of the\r\nentire country is a pastural land yet the woolen industry has never\r\nbeen developed. Every year, plenty of raw materials are exported from\r\nChina on the one hand and plenty of finished woolen goods imported on\r\nthe other. Judging by the import and export of the woolen trade the\r\ndevelopment of woolen industry in China will surely be a profitable\r\nbusiness. I suggest that scientific methods be applied to the raising\r\nof sheep and to the treatment of wool so as to improve the quality\r\nand increase the quantity. Modern factories should be established\r\nall over northwestern China for manufacturing all kinds of finished\r\nwoolen goods. Here we have the raw materials, cheap labor and unlimited\r\nmarket. What we want for the development of this industry is foreign\r\ncapital and experts. This will be one of the most remunerative projects\r\nin our International Development Scheme, for the industry will be a new\r\none and there will be no private competitors on the field.\r\n\r\n\r\ne. The Leather Industry\r\n\r\nThis will also be a new industry in China, despite the fact that there\r\nare a few tanneries in the treaty ports. The export of hides from and\r\nthe import of leather goods into China are increasing every year. So,\r\nto establish a system of tanneries and factories for leather goods and\r\nfoot-gear will be a lucrative undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nf. The Manufacturing of Clothing Machinery\r\n\r\nThe machinery for the manufacturing of various kinds of clothing\r\nmaterials is in great demand in China. It is reported that the orders\r\nfor cotton mill machinery have been filled up for the next three\r\nyears from manufacturers in Europe and America. If China is developed\r\naccording to my programs, the demand for machinery will be many\r\ntimes greater than at present and the supply in Europe and America\r\nwill be too short to meet it. Therefore to establish factories for\r\nthe manufacturing of clothing machinery is a necessary as well as a\r\nprofitable undertaking. Such factories should be established in the\r\nneighborhood of iron and steel factories, so as to save expenses for\r\ntransportation of heavy materials. What will be the capital for this\r\nundertaking should be decided by experts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nThe Housing Industry\r\n\r\nAmong the four hundred millions in China the poor still live in huts\r\nand hovels, and in caves in the loess region of north China while\r\nthe middle and the rich classes live in temples. All the so-called\r\nhouses in China, excepting a few after western style and those in\r\ntreaty ports are built after the model of a temple. When a Chinese\r\nbuilds a house he has more regard for the dead than for the living.\r\nThe first consideration of the owner is his ancestral shrine. This\r\nmust be placed at the center of the house, and all the other parts\r\nmust be complement and secondary to it. The house is planned not for\r\ncomfort but for ceremonies, that is, for \"the red and white affairs,\"\r\nas they are called in China. The \"red affair\" is the marriage or other\r\nfelicitous celebrations of any member of the family, and the \"white\r\naffair\" is the funeral ceremonies. Besides the ancestral shrine there\r\nare the shrines of the various household gods. All these are of more\r\nimportance than man and must be considered before him. There is not\r\na home in old China that is planned for the comfort and convenience\r\nof man alone. So now when we plan the housing industry in China in\r\nour International Development Scheme, we must take the houses of the\r\nentire population of China into consideration. \"To build houses for\r\nfour hundred millions, it is impossible!\" some may exclaim. This is\r\nthe largest job ever conceived by man. But if China is going to give\r\nup her foolish traditions and useless habits and customs of the last\r\nthree thousand years and begin to adopt modern civilization, as our\r\nindustrial development scheme is going to introduce, the remodelling\r\nof all the houses according to modern comforts and conveniences is\r\nbound to come, either unconsciously by social evolution or consciously\r\nby artificial construction. The modern civilization so far attained\r\nby western nations is entirely an unconscious progress, for social\r\nand economic sciences are but recent discoveries. But henceforth\r\nall human progress will be more or less based upon knowledge, that\r\nis upon scientific planning. As we can foresee now, within half a\r\ncentury under our industrial development, the houses of all China\r\nwill be renewed according to modern comfort and convenience. Is it\r\nnot far better and cheaper to rebuild the houses of all China by a\r\npreconceived scientific plan than by none? I have no doubt that if\r\nwe plan to build a thousand houses at one time it would be ten times\r\ncheaper than to plan and build one at a time, and the more we build the\r\ncheaper terms we would get. This is a positive economic law. The only\r\ndanger in this is over-production. That is the only obstacle for all\r\nproduction on a large scale. Since the industrial revolution in Europe\r\nand America, every financial panic before the world war was caused by\r\nover-production. In the case of our housing industry in China, there\r\nare four hundred million customers. At least fifty million houses will\r\nbe needed in the coming fifty years. Thus a million houses a year will\r\nbe the normal demand of the country.\r\n\r\nHouses are a great factor in civilization. They give men more enjoyment\r\nand happiness than food and clothes. More than half of the human\r\nindustries are contributing to household needs. The housing industry\r\nwill be the greatest undertaking of our International Development\r\nScheme, and also will be the most profitable part of it. My object of\r\nthe development of the housing industry is to provide cheap houses to\r\nthe masses. A ten thousand dollar house now built in the treaty port\r\ncan be produced for less than a thousand dollars and yet a high margin\r\nof profit can be made. In order to accomplish this we have to produce\r\ntransport, and distribute the materials for construction. After the\r\nhouse is finished, all household equipment must be furnished. Both of\r\nthese will be comprised in the housing industry which I shall formulate\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  a. The Production and Transportation of Building Materials.\r\n  b. The Construction of Houses.\r\n  c. The Manufacturing of Furniture.\r\n  d. The Supply of Household Utilities.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The Production and Transportation of Building Materials\r\n\r\nThe building materials are bricks, tiles, timber, skeleton iron, stone,\r\ncement and mortar. Each of these materials must be manufactured or\r\ncut out from raw materials. So kilns for the manufacture of tiles and\r\nbricks must be put up. Mills for timbers must be established, also\r\nfactories for skeleton irons. Quarries must be opened and factories for\r\ncement and mortar must be started. All these establishments must be\r\nput up at suitable districts where materials and markets are near one\r\nanother. All should be under one central control so as to regulate the\r\noutput of each of these materials in proportion to the demand. After\r\nthe materials are ready they must be transported to the places where\r\nthey are wanted by special bottoms on waterways, and by special cars on\r\nrailways so as to reduce the cost as low as possible. For this purpose\r\nspecial boats and cars must be built by the shipbuilding department and\r\nthe car factory.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Construction of Houses\r\n\r\nThe houses to be built in China will comprise public buildings and\r\nprivate residences. As the public buildings are to be built with public\r\nfunds for public uses which will not be a profitable undertaking, a\r\nspecial Government Department should therefore be created to take\r\ncharge. The houses that are to be built under this International\r\nDevelopment Scheme will be private residences only with the object to\r\nprovide cheap houses for the people, as well as to make profit for this\r\nInternational concern. The houses will be built on standardized types.\r\nIn cities and towns the houses should be constructed on two lines: the\r\nsingle family and the group family houses. The former should again be\r\nsub-divided into eight-roomed, ten-roomed and twelve-roomed houses, and\r\nthe latter into ten-family, hundred-family and thousand-family houses,\r\nwith four or six rooms for each family. In the country districts the\r\nhouses should be classified according to the occupation of the people,\r\nand special annexes such as barns and dairies should be provided for\r\nthe farmers. All houses should be designed and built according to the\r\nneeds and comfort of man; so a special architectural department should\r\nbe established to study the habits, occupations and needs of different\r\npeople and make improvements from time to time. The construction should\r\nbe performed as much as possible by labor-saving machinery so as to\r\naccelerate work and save expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. The Manufacturing of Furniture\r\n\r\nAs all houses in China should be remodelled all furniture should be\r\nreplaced by up-to-date ones, which are made for the comforts and needs\r\nof man. Furniture of the following kinds should be manufactured: the\r\nlibrary, the parlor, the bedroom, the kitchen, the bathroom and the\r\ntoilet. Each kind should be manufactured in a special factory under the\r\nmanagement of the International Development Organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. The Supply of Household Utilities\r\n\r\nThe household utilities are water, light, heat, fuel and telephones.\r\nExcept in treaty ports, there is no water-supply system in any of the\r\ncities and towns of China. Even many treaty ports possess none as yet.\r\nIn all the large cities, the people obtain their water from rivers\r\nwhich at the same time act as sewage. The water supply of the large\r\ncities and towns in China is most unsanitary, (1) It is an urgent\r\nnecessity that water supply systems should be installed in all cities\r\nand towns in China without delay. Therefore special factories for\r\nequipping the water system should be established in order to meet the\r\nneeds. (2) Lighting plants should be installed in all the cities and\r\ntowns in China. So factories for the manufacture of the machinery\r\nlighting plants should be established. (3) Modern heating plants\r\nshould be installed in every household, using either electricity, gas,\r\nor steam. So the manufacturing of heating equipment is a necessity.\r\nFactories should be established for this purpose. (4) Cooking fuel is\r\none of the most costly items in the daily needs of the Chinese people.\r\nIn the country the people generally devote ten per pent of their\r\nworking time to gathering firewoods. In town the people spend about\r\ntwenty per cent of their living expenses for firewood alone. Thus this\r\nfirewood question accumulates into a great national waste. The firewood\r\nand grass as a cooking fuel must be substituted by coal in the country\r\ndistricts, and by gas or electricity in towns and cities. In order to\r\nuse coal gas and electricity, proper equipment must be provided. So\r\nfactories for the manufacturing of coal gas, and electricity, stoves\r\nfor every family must be established by this International Development\r\nOrganization. (5) Telephones must also be supplied to every family in\r\nthe cities as well as in the country. So factories for manufacturing\r\nthe equipment must be put up in China, in order to render them as cheap\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nThe Motoring Industry\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are a stagnant race. From time immemorial a man is praised\r\nfor staying at home and caring for his immediate surroundings only.\r\nLaotse--a contemporary of Confucius--says: \"The good people are those\r\nwho live in countries so near to each other that they can hear each\r\nother's cock crow and dog bark and yet they never have had intercourse\r\nwith each other during their lifetime.\" This is often quoted as the\r\nGolden Age of the Chinese people. But in modern civilization the\r\ncondition is entirely changed. Moving about occupies a great part of\r\na man's life time. It is the movement of man that makes civilization\r\nprogress. China, in order to catch up with modern civilization, must\r\nmove. And the movement of the individual forms an important part of the\r\nnational activity. A man must move whenever and wherever he pleases\r\nwith ease and rapidity. However, China, at present, lacks the means\r\nof facility for individual movement, for all the old great highways\r\nwere ruined and have disappeared, and the automobile has not yet been\r\nintroduced into the interior of the country. The motor car, a recent\r\ninvention, is a necessity for rapid movement. If we wish to move\r\nquickly and do more work, we must adopt the motor car as a vehicle. But\r\nbefore we can use the motor car, we have to build our roads. In the\r\npreliminary part of this International Development Scheme, I proposed\r\nto construct one million miles of roads. These should be apportioned\r\naccording to the ratio of population in each district for construction.\r\nIn the eighteen provinces of China Proper, there are nearly 2,000\r\nhsiens. If all parts of China are to adopt the hsien administration,\r\nthere will be nearly 4,000 hsiens in all. Thus the construction of\r\nroads for each hsien will be on an average of 250 miles. But some\r\nof the hsiens have more people and some have less. If we divide the\r\nmillion miles of roads by the four hundred million people, we shall\r\nhave one mile to every four hundred. For four hundred people to build\r\none mile of road is not a very difficult task to accomplish. If my\r\nscheme of making road-building as a condition for granting local\r\nautonomy is adopted by the nation, we shall see one million miles of\r\nroad built in a very short time as if by a magic wand.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the people of China decide to build roads, this\r\nInternational Development Organization can begin to put up factories\r\nfor manufacturing motor cars. First start on a small scale and\r\ngradually expand the plants to build more and more until they are\r\nsufficient to supply the needs of the four hundred million people. The\r\ncars should be manufactured to suit different purposes, such as the\r\nfarmer's car, the artisan's car, the business man's car, the tourist's\r\ncar, the truck car, etc. All these cars, if turned out on a large\r\nscale, can be made much cheaper than at present, so that everybody who\r\nwishes it, may have one.\r\n\r\nBesides supplying cheap cars, we must also supply cheap fuel, otherwise\r\nthe people will still be unable to use them. So the development of the\r\noil fields in China should follow the motor car industry. This will be\r\ndealt with in more detail under the mining industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nThe Printing Industry\r\n\r\nThis industry provides man with intellectual food. It is a necessity\r\nof modern society, without which mankind cannot progress. All human\r\nactivities are recorded, and all human knowledge is stored in printing.\r\nIt is a great factor of civilization. The progress and civilization of\r\ndifferent nations of the world are measured largely by the quantity of\r\nprinted matter they turned out annually. China, though the nation that\r\ninvented printing, is very backward in the development of its printing\r\nindustry. In our International Development Scheme, the printing\r\nindustry must also be given a place. If China is developed industrially\r\naccording to the lines which I suggested, the demand for printed matter\r\nby the four hundred millions will be exceedingly great. In order to\r\nmeet this demand efficiently, a system of large printing houses must be\r\nestablished in all large cities in the country, to undertake printing\r\nof all kinds from newspapers to encyclopædia. The best modern books\r\non various subjects in different countries should be translated into\r\nChinese and published in cheap edition form for the general public in\r\nChina. All the publishing houses should be organized under one common\r\nmanagement, so as to secure the best economic results.\r\n\r\nIn order to make printed matter cheap, other subsidiary industries must\r\nbe developed at the same time. The most important of these is the\r\npaper industry. At present all the paper used by newspapers in China\r\nis imported. And the demand for paper is increasing every day. China\r\nhas plenty of raw materials for making paper, such as the vast virgin\r\nforests of the northwestern part of the country, and the wild reeds of\r\nthe Yangtze and its neighboring swamps which would furnish the best\r\npulps. So, large plants for manufacturing papers should be put up in\r\nsuitable locations. Besides the paper factories, ink factories, type\r\nfoundries, printing machine factories, etc., should be established\r\nunder a central management to produce everything that is needed in the\r\nprinting industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM VI\r\n\r\nThe Mining Industry\r\n\r\n\r\nMining and farming are the two most important means of producing raw\r\nmaterials for industries. As farming is to produce food for man, so\r\nmining is to produce food for machinery. Machinery is the tree of\r\nmodern industries, and the mining industry is the root of machinery.\r\nThus, without the mining industry there would be no machinery, and\r\nwithout machinery there would be no modern industries which have\r\nrevolutionized the economic conditions of mankind. The mining industry,\r\nafter all, is the greatest factor of material civilization and economic\r\nprogress. Although in the fifth part of the first program I suggested\r\nthe development of the iron and coal fields in Chili and Shansi as\r\nan auxiliary project for the development of the Great Northern Port,\r\nstill, a special program should be devoted to mining in general. The\r\nmineral lands of China belong to the state, and mining in China is\r\nstill in its infancy. So to develop the mining industry from the outset\r\nas a state enterprise would be a sound economic measure. But mining in\r\ngeneral is very risky and to enlist foreign capital in its development\r\nin a wholesale manner is unadvisable. Therefore, only such mining\r\nprojects which are sure to be profitable will be brought under the\r\nInternational Development Scheme. I shall formulate this mining program\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    I. The Mining of Iron.\r\n   II. The Mining of Coal.\r\n  III. The Mining of Oil.\r\n   IV. The Mining of Copper.\r\n    V. The Working of Some Particular Mines.\r\n   VI. The Manufacture of Mining Machinery.\r\n  VII. The Establishment of Smelting Plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nThe Mining of Iron\r\n\r\nIron is the most important element in modern industries. Its deposits\r\nare found in great quantities in certain areas and can be easily mined.\r\nThe iron mines should be worked absolutely as a state property. Besides\r\nthe Chili and Shansi iron mines, the other iron fields must also be\r\ndeveloped. There are very rich deposits in the southwestern provinces,\r\nthe Yangtze Valley and the northwestern provinces in China Proper.\r\nSinkiang, Mongolia, Manchuria, Kokonor, and Tibet also possess large\r\ndeposits of iron. We have the Han Yeh Ping Iron and Steel Works in\r\nthe Yangtze Valley and the Pen Chi Hu Iron and Steel Works in South\r\nManchuria, both of which are largely capitalized by Japan and are\r\nworking very profitably lately. There should be similar works in the\r\nvicinity of Canton, the Great Southern Port, and also in Szechuen, and\r\nYunnan, where iron and coal are found side by side. The iron deposits\r\nin Sinkiang, Kansu, Mongolia, etc., must also be developed one after\r\nthe other, according to the needs of the locality. Iron and Steel Works\r\nmust be put up in each of these regions to supply the local demand\r\nfor manufactured iron. What amount of capital should be invested in\r\nthese additional iron and steel works must be thoroughly investigated\r\nby experts. But I should say that a sum equal to or double the amount\r\nto be invested in the Chili and Shansi iron and steel works will not\r\nbe too much, because of the great demand which will result in the\r\ndevelopment of China.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nThe Mining of Coal\r\n\r\nChina is known to be the country most rich in coal deposits, yet her\r\ncoal fields are scarcely scratched. The output of coal in the United\r\nStates is about six hundred million tons a year. If China is equally\r\ndeveloped she should, according to the proportion of her population,\r\nhave an output of four times as much coal as the United States. This\r\nwill be the possibility of coal mining in China which the International\r\nDevelopment Organization is to undertake. As coal deposits are found\r\nin great quantities in certain areas so its output can be estimated\r\nquite accurately beforehand. Thus, the risk is of no consideration and\r\nthe profit is sure. But as coal is a necessity of civilized community\r\nand the sinews of modern industries, the principal object for mining\r\nshould not be for profit alone, but for supplying the needs of mankind.\r\nAfter the payment of interest and capital of the foreign loans for\r\nits development, and the securing of high wages for the miners, the\r\nprice of coal should be reduced as low as possible so as to meet the\r\ndemands of the public as well as to give impetus to the development of\r\nvarious industries. I suggest that besides the mining of coal for the\r\niron and steel works, a plan for producing two hundred million tons\r\nof coal a year for other uses should be formed at the start. Mines\r\nshould be opened along the seaboard and navigable rivers. As Europe is\r\nnow seeking coal from China this amount will not be over-production\r\nfrom the beginning. A few years later when the industries of China\r\nwill be more developed more coal will be needed. How much capital will\r\nbe required and what mines are to be worked, have to be submitted to\r\nscientific investigation under expert direction.\r\n\r\nBesides coal mining, the coal products industry must be developed under\r\nthe same management. This is a new industry without any competition and\r\nhas an unlimited market in China. Great profits will be assured on the\r\ncapital invested.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nThe Mining of Oil\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that the richest company in the world is the Standard\r\nOil Company of New York, and that the richest man in the world\r\nis Rockefeller, organizer of this company. This proves that oil\r\nmining is a most profitable business. China is known to be a very\r\nrich oil-bearing country. Oil springs are found in the provinces of\r\nSzechuen, Kansu, Sinkiang, and Shensi. How vast is the underground\r\nreservoir of oil in China is not yet known. But the already known oil\r\nsprings have never been worked and made use of, while the import of\r\nkerosene, gasoline, and crude oil from abroad is increasing every year.\r\nWhen China is developed as a motoring country, the use of gasoline will\r\nbe increased a thousand-fold, then the supply from the foreign fields\r\nwill not be able to meet the demands, as shortage of oil is already\r\nfelt in Europe and America. The mining of oil in China will soon become\r\na necessity. This enterprise should be taken up by the International\r\nDevelopment Organization for the state. Production on a large scale\r\nshould be started at once. Pipe line systems should be installed\r\nbetween oil districts and populous and industrial centers in the\r\ninterior and also river and sea ports. What amount of capital should be\r\ninvested in the project will have to be investigated by experts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nThe Mining of Copper\r\n\r\nThe copper deposits, like iron ores, are found in great quantities\r\nin different places. So the quantity of ores in each mine can be\r\naccurately estimated before it is opened and its working generally\r\nruns no risk. Thus, the mining of copper should be taken up as a\r\ngovernment enterprise, as was always the case in China, and financed\r\nand worked by the International Development Organization. The richest\r\ncopper deposits in China are found along the border of Szechuen and\r\nYunnan on the Yangtze River. The government copper mine in Chaotung,\r\nin the northeastern corner of Yunnan, has been working for many\r\ncenturies. Cash, the standard currency of China, was made mostly\r\nof the copper from Yunnan province. The currency still absorbs an\r\nenormous quantity of copper. Owing to the difficulty of transporting\r\nthe Yunnan copper, most of the metal for currency is being imported\r\nfrom foreign countries. Besides currency, copper is very commonly used\r\nfor many other purposes and when the industries in China are developed\r\nthe demand will increase a hundred times. So the demand for this\r\nmetal will be very great in the market of China alone. I suggest that\r\nproduction on a large scale should be adopted and modern plants should\r\nbe installed in copper mines. How much capital to be invested in this\r\nenterprise should be decided by experts after careful investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nThe Working of Some Particular Mines\r\n\r\nIn regard to the mining of various kinds of metal, some particular\r\nmines should be taken up by the International Development Organization.\r\nThere are many famous mines in China which have been worked for many\r\ncenturies by hand, such as the Kochui tin mine in Yunnan, the Moho gold\r\nmine in Heilungkiang, and the Khotan jade mine in Sinkiang. All these\r\nmines are known to have very rich deposits,--the deeper the richer.\r\nHitherto only the surface parts of those mines have been worked and\r\nthe larger deposits are still untouched, owing to the lack of means of\r\ngetting rid of the water. Some of the mines are still in the hands of\r\nthe Government, while others have been given up to private concerns. If\r\nmodern machinery is adopted the mines should revert to the Government\r\nso as to secure economy in working. Many discarded mines of this kind\r\nshould be thoroughly investigated, and if found profitable, work should\r\nbe resumed under the International Development Scheme. All future\r\nmining, other than government enterprise, should be leased to private\r\nconcerns on contract, and when the term is up, the government has the\r\noption to take them over, if found profitable as a state property. Thus\r\nall profitable mines will be socialized in time and the profit will be\r\nequally shared by all the people in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nThe Manufacture of Mining Machinery\r\n\r\nMost of the metal deposits of the earth are in small quantities\r\nand scattered far and wide in various places. Most of the mining\r\nenterprises resemble farming in that it is more profitable to work by\r\nindividuals and small parties. As such is the case, most of the mining\r\nenterprises have to be worked out by private concerns. In order to\r\naccelerate the development of mining, more liberal laws should be\r\nadopted; education and information should be given freely by experts\r\nemployed by the state; and encouragement and financial assistance\r\nshould be given by the state and private banks. The part that the\r\nInternational Development Organization should take in general mining\r\nenterprises is to manufacture all kinds of mining tools and machinery,\r\nand to supply them to the miners at low cost, either on cash or on\r\ncredit. By distributing tools and machinery to the surplus workers in\r\nChina, the mining industry would be developed by leaps and bounds.\r\nAnd the more the mining industry is developed the more will be the\r\ndemand for tools and machinery. Thus the profits for the manufacturing\r\nconcerns would be limitless, so to speak. Of course, the factories\r\nshould be started on a small scale and be extended gradually according\r\nto the ratio of the development of the mining industry. I suggest that\r\nthe first factory of this kind should be established at Canton, the\r\nseaport of the southwestern mining region, where raw materials and\r\nskilled labor can be easily obtained. The other factories should be\r\nestablished in Hankow and the Great Northern Port afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VII\r\n\r\nThe Establishment of Smelting Plants\r\n\r\nSmelting plants for various kinds of metals should be put up in all\r\nmining districts to turn ore into metals. These smelting plants should\r\nbe conducted under the coöperative system. At first, a reasonable price\r\nshould be paid to the miner when the ore is collected. Afterwards, when\r\nthe metal is sold, either at home or in foreign markets, the smelting\r\nworks will take a share of the profit to cover the expenses, the\r\ninterest, the sinking fund, etc. The surplus profit should be divided\r\namong the workers according to their wages, and among the capitalists\r\naccording to the proportion of ore they contribute to the furnace. In\r\nthis way we can encourage private mining enterprise which forms the\r\nroot of other industries. All smelting works should be put up according\r\nto local needs and their scale should be determined by experts and\r\nmanaged under a central control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this International Development Scheme, I venture to present a\r\npractical solution for the three great world questions which are the\r\nInternational War, the Commercial War and the Class War. As it has been\r\ndiscovered by post-Darwin philosophers that the primary force of human\r\nevolution is coöperation and not struggle as that of the animal world,\r\nso the fighting nature, a residue of the animal instinct in man, must\r\nbe eliminated from man, the sooner the better.\r\n\r\nInternational war is nothing more than pure and simple organized\r\nrobbery on a grand scale, which all right-minded people deplore. When\r\nthe United States of America turned the recent European conflict into a\r\nworld war by taking part in it, the American people to a man determined\r\nto make this war end war forever. And the hope of the peace-loving\r\nnations in the world was raised so high that we Chinese thought that\r\nthe \"Tatung\" or the Great Harmony Age was at hand. But unfortunately,\r\nthe United States has completely failed in peace, in spite of her great\r\nsuccess in war. Thus, the world has been thrown back to the pre-war\r\ncondition again. The scrambling for territories, the struggle for\r\nfood, and the fighting for raw materials will begin anew. So instead\r\nof disarmament there is going to be a greater increase in the armies\r\nand navies of the once allied powers for the next war. China, the most\r\nrich and populous country in the world, will be the prize. Some years\r\nago there was great inclination among the Powers to divide China and\r\nImperial Russia actually took steps to colonize Manchuria. But the then\r\nchivalrous Japan went to war with Russia and thus saved China from\r\npartition. Now the militaristic policy of Japan is to swallow China\r\nalone. So long as China is left to the tender mercy of the militaristic\r\npowers she must either succumb to partition by several powers or be\r\nswallowed up by one power.\r\n\r\nHowever, the tide of the world seems to be turning. After centuries of\r\nsound slumber, the Chinese people at last are waking up and realizing\r\nthat we must get up and follow in the world's progress. Now we are at\r\nthe parting of the ways. Shall we organize for war or shall we organize\r\nfor peace? Our militarists and reactionaries desire the former, and\r\nthey are going to Japanize China, so that when the time comes they will\r\nstart another Boxer Movement once more to defy the civilized world. But\r\nas the founder of the Chung Hwa Min Kuo--the Chinese Republic--I desire\r\nto have China organized for peace. I, therefore, begin to utilize\r\nmy pen, which I hope will prove even mightier than the sword that I\r\nused to destroy the Manchu Dynasty, to write out these programs for\r\norganizing China for peace.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of my writing, these programs have been published\r\nin various magazines and newspapers time after time and are being\r\nspread all over China. They are welcomed everywhere and by everyone\r\nin the country. So far there is not a word expressed in disfavor of\r\nmy proposition. The only anxiety ever expressed regarding my scheme\r\nis where can we obtain such huge sums of money to carry out even a\r\nsmall part of this comprehensive project. Fortunately, however, soon\r\nafter the preliminary part of my programs had been sent out to the\r\ndifferent governments and the Peace Conference, a new Consortium was\r\nformed in Paris for the purpose of assisting China in developing her\r\nnatural resources. This was initiated by the American Government. Thus\r\nwe need not fear the lack of capital to start work in our industrial\r\ndevelopment. If the Powers are sincere in their motive to coöperate for\r\nmutual benefit, then the military struggle for material gain in China\r\ncould eventually be averted. For by coöperation, they can secure more\r\nbenefits and advantages than by struggle. The Japanese militarists\r\nstill think that war is the most profitable national pursuit, and\r\ntheir General Staff keeps on planning a war once in a decade. This\r\nJapanese illusion was encouraged and strengthened by the campaign of\r\n1894 against China, a cheap and short one but rich in remuneration for\r\nJapan; also by the campaign of 1904 against Russia which was a great\r\nsuccess to the Japanese, and its fruit of victory was no less in value;\r\nfinally by the campaign of 1914 against Germany which formed her part\r\nin the world war Japan took. Although Japan took the smallest part in\r\nthe world war and expended the least in men and money, yet the fruit\r\nof her victory was Shantung, a territory as large as Roumania before\r\nthe war, with a population as numerous as that of France. With such\r\ncrowning results in every war during the last thirty years no wonder\r\nthe Japanese militarists think that the most profitable business in\r\nthis world is War.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the last war in Europe proves, however, just the\r\ncontrary. An aggressive Germany lost entirely her capital and\r\ninterests, plus something more, while victorious France gained\r\npractically nothing. Since China is awake now, the next aggression from\r\nJapan will surely be met by a resolute resistance from the Chinese\r\npeople. Even granted that Japan could conquer China, it would be an\r\nimpossibility for Japan to govern China profitably for any period of\r\ntime. The Japanese financiers possess better foresight than their\r\nmilitarists as was proved during the dispute of the Manchurian and\r\nthe Mongolian reservations when the former prevailed over the latter\r\nthus causing the Japanese Government to give up her monopoly of these\r\nterritories to the new Consortium, in order to coöperate with the other\r\npowers. We, the Chinese people, who desire to organize China for peace\r\nwill welcome heartily this new Consortium provided it will carry out\r\nthe principles which are outlined in these programs. Thus, coöperation\r\nof various nations can be secured and the military struggle for\r\nindividual and national gain will cease forever.\r\n\r\nCommercial war, or competition, is a struggle between the capitalists\r\nthemselves. This war has no national distinction. It is fought just\r\nas furiously and mercilessly between countries as well as within\r\nthe country. The method of fighting is to undersell each other, in\r\norder to exhaust the weaker rivals so that the victor may control the\r\nmarket alone and dictate terms to the consuming public as long as\r\npossible. The result of the commercial war is no less harmful and cruel\r\nto the vanquished foes than an armed conflict. This war has become\r\nmore and more furious every day since the adoption of machinery for\r\nproduction. It was once thought by the economists of the Adam Smith\r\nschool that competition was a beneficent factor and a sound economic\r\nsystem, but modern economists discovered that it is a very wasteful\r\nand ruinous system. As a matter of fact, modern economic tendencies\r\nwork in a contrary direction, that is, towards concentration instead\r\nof competition. That is the reason why the trusts in America flourish\r\nin spite of the anti-trust law and the public opinion which aim at\r\nsuppressing them. For trusts, by eliminating waste and cutting down\r\nexpenses can produce much cheaper than individual producers. Whenever\r\na trust enters into a certain field of industry, it always sweeps that\r\nfield clean of rivals, by supplying cheap articles to the public. This\r\nwould prove a blessing to the public but for the unfortunate fact that\r\nthe trust is a private concern, and its object is to make as much\r\nprofit as possible. As soon as all rivals are swept dean from the field\r\nof competition, the trust would raise the price of its articles as\r\nhigh as possible. Thus the public is oppressed by it. The trust is a\r\nresult of economic evolution, therefore it is out of human power to\r\nsuppress it. The proper remedy is to have it owned by all the people\r\nof the country. In my International Development Scheme, I intend to\r\nmake all the national industries of China into a Great Trust owned by\r\nthe Chinese people, and financed with international capital for mutual\r\nbenefit. Thus once for all, commercial war will be done away with in\r\nthe largest market of the world.\r\n\r\nClass war is a struggle between labor and capital. The war is at\r\npresent raging at its full height in all the highly developed\r\nindustrial countries. Labor feels sure of its final victory while\r\ncapitalists are determined to resist to the bitter end. When will it\r\nend and what will be the decision no one dares to predict. China,\r\nhowever, owing to the backwardness of her industrial development,\r\nwhich is a blessing in disguise, in this respect, has not yet entered\r\ninto the class war. Our laboring class, commonly known as coolies,\r\nare living from hand to mouth and will therefore only be too glad to\r\nwelcome any capitalist who would even put up a sweat shop to exploit\r\nthem. The capitalist is a rare specimen in China and is only beginning\r\nto make his appearance in the treaty ports.\r\n\r\nHowever, China must develop her industries by all means. Shall we\r\nfollow the old path of western civilization? This old path resembles\r\nthe sea route of Columbus' first trip to America. He set out from\r\nEurope by a southwesterly direction through the Canary Islands to San\r\nSalvador, in the Bahama Group. But nowadays navigators take a different\r\ndirection to America and find that the destination can be reached by a\r\ndistance many times shorter. The path of western civilization was an\r\nunknown one and those who went before groped in the dark as Columbus\r\ndid on his first voyage to America. As a late comer, China can greatly\r\nprofit in covering the space by following the direction already charted\r\nby western pioneers. Thus we can foresee that the final goal of the\r\nwestward-ho in the Atlantic is not India but the New World. So is the\r\ncase in the economic ocean. The goal of material civilization is not\r\nprivate profit but public profit. And the shortest route to it is not\r\ncompetition but coöperation. In my International Development Scheme,\r\nI propose that the profits of this industrial development should go\r\nfirst to pay the interest and principal of foreign capital invested in\r\nit; second to give high wages to labor; and third to improve or extend\r\nthe machinery of production. Besides these provisions the rest of the\r\nprofit I should go to the public in the form of reduced prices in all\r\ncommodities and public services. Thus, all will enjoy, in the same\r\ndegree, the fruits of modern civilization. This industrial development\r\nscheme which is roughly sketched in the above six programs is a part\r\nof my general plan for constructing a New China. In a nutshell, it is\r\nmy idea to make capitalism create socialism in China so that these two\r\neconomic forces of human evolution will work side by side in future\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR THE FINANCING AND CONSTRUCTION OF\r\nTHE RAILWAY FROM CANTON TO CHUNGKING WITH EXTENSION TO LANCHOW\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is made at Shanghai on the fourth day of the seventh\r\nmonth of the second year of the Republic of China being the fourth\r\nday of July, 1913, and the contracting parties are: The Chinese\r\nNational Railway Corporation (hereinafter termed \"the Corporation\")\r\nduly authorized in virtue of the Presidential Mandate of the ninth\r\nday of the ninth month of the Republic of China being the ninth day\r\nof September, 1912, and in virtue of the Charter of the Corporation\r\nduly promulgated by a Presidential Mandate of the thirty-first day of\r\nthe third month of the second year of the Republic of China being the\r\nthirty-first day of March, 1913, on the one part and Messrs. Pauling\r\nand Company, Limited, of 26 Victoria Street, London, S. W. (hereinafter\r\ntermed \"the Contractors\") on the other part.\r\n\r\nNOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between the parties hereto as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE I\r\n\r\nThe Contractors, or their Assigns, agree to issue on behalf of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of China a sterling Loan, bearing interest\r\nat the rate of five per cent per annum, (hereinafter referred to as\r\n\"the Loan\") for such an amount as may be mutually estimated to be\r\nnecessary for the completion of the Railway from Canton to Chungking.\r\n\r\nThe Loan shall be of the date on which the first series of Bonds are\r\nissued and shall be called \"The Chinese National Railways Government\r\nfive per cent Gold Loan of 1912 for the Canton Chungking Railway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE II\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of the Loan are designed for the construction and\r\nequipment of the Railway from Canton to Chungking (hereinafter called\r\n\"the Railway\") and for all necessary expenditure appertaining thereto\r\nas may be arranged in the Detailed Agreement, referred to in Article 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE III\r\n\r\nThe payment of the interest and the redemption of the Capital of the\r\nLoan are guaranteed by the Government of the Republic of China and by a\r\nspecial lien upon the Canton Chungking Railway.\r\n\r\nThis special lien constitutes a first mortgage in favour of the\r\nContractors, acting on behalf of the Bondholders, upon the Railway\r\nitself, as and when constructed, and on the revenue of all\r\ndescriptions derivable therefrom, and upon all materials, rolling stock\r\nand buildings of every description purchased or to be purchased for the\r\nRailway.\r\n\r\nShould there be default in payments on the dates fixed of all or part\r\nof the half yearly interest or amortization payments, the Contractors\r\nshall have the right to exercise on behalf of the Bondholders all the\r\nrights of action which accrue to them from the special mortgage.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV\r\n\r\nDuring the time of construction of the Railway the interest on the\r\nBonds and on any advances made by the Contractors shall be paid from\r\nthe proceeds of the Loan. The accruing interest from any proceeds of\r\nthe Loan not used during the period of construction, and the earnings\r\nderived by the Corporation from the working of any sections of the\r\nRailway as they are built, are to be used to make up the amount\r\nrequired for the payment of the said interest, and if any deficiency\r\nremains it is to be met from the proceeds of the Loan.\r\n\r\nWhen the construction of the Railway is wholly completed, the interest\r\non the Bonds is to be paid from the income or earnings of the Railway\r\nreceived by the Corporation, in such manner and on such dates as may be\r\nprovided for in the Detailed Agreement provided for in Article 17 of\r\nthis Agreement.\r\n\r\nIf, at any time, the earnings of the Railway, together with the\r\nfunds available from the proceeds of the Loan, are not sufficient\r\nto meet the interest on the Bonds and the repayment of the capital\r\nin accordance with the Amortization Schedule to be attached to the\r\nDetailed Agreement, the Government of the Republic of China, in\r\napproving of this Agreement, unconditionally undertakes and promises to\r\npay the principal of the Loan and the interest of the Loan on the due\r\ndates to be fixed therefor in the Detailed Agreement provided for in\r\nArticle 17 of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE V\r\n\r\nThe bonds shall be Bonds of the Government of the Republic of China.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VI\r\n\r\nThe Loan shall be issued to the public in two or more series of Bonds,\r\nthe first issue to be made to the amount of from one to two million\r\npounds sterling as soon as possible after the signature of the Detailed\r\nAgreement referred to in Article 17 of this Agreement. The issue price\r\nof the Bonds shall be fixed by the Corporation and the Contractors\r\nsometime before the issue, taking the last price of similar Bonds as a\r\nbasis for fixing the market price. The price payable to the Corporation\r\nshall be the actual rate of issue to the public less a sufficient\r\namount to cover the cost of stamps on the Bonds in the various\r\ncountries of issue, provided always that at least fifty per cent of the\r\nBonds shall be issued in England, plus floatation charges of four per\r\ncent retainable by the Contractors (that is to say, a charge of four\r\npounds for every one hundred pound Bond issued).\r\n\r\nAfter the Detailed Agreement referred to in Article 17 is settled, and\r\npending the issue of the Loan, the Contractors shall deposit the sum\r\nof fifty thousand pounds with the issuing Bank to the Canton Chungking\r\nRailway account, and this amount can be drawn on by the Corporation for\r\nsurvey and other necessary expenses authorized by the Managing Director\r\nagainst certificates signed by the Chief Accountant and Chief Engineer.\r\nThis sum of fifty thousand pounds shall bear interest at the rate of\r\nfive per cent per annum and shall be refunded out of the proceeds of\r\nthe Loan.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of the Loan shall be deposited with the issuing Bank,\r\nto be nominated and guaranteed by the Contractors, to the credit of\r\na Canton Chungking Railway Account on such terms as may be mutually\r\narranged in the Detailed Agreement referred to in Article 17.\r\n\r\nWhen the work of construction is ready to begin a sum equal to the\r\nestimated expenditure in China for six months shall be transferred to\r\na Bank in China to be mutually agreed upon and there placed to the\r\ncredit of a Canton Chungking Railway Account to be operated upon by the\r\nCorporation under certificates signed by the Chief Accountant and the\r\nChief Engineer. This amount of estimated expenditure for six months\r\nshall be maintained by subsequent monthly transfers so that, as far\r\nas possible, there shall always be six months estimated expenditure in\r\nChina on deposit in a Bank in China to be mutually agreed upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VIII\r\n\r\nImmediately after the signing of the Detailed Agreement, the\r\nCorporation will establish a Head Office at Canton for the Canton\r\nChungking Railway. This Office will be under the direction of a\r\nChinese Managing Director to be appointed by the Corporation, with\r\nwhom will be associated a British Engineer-in-Chief and a British Firm\r\nof Public Accountants, of recognized standing, whose representative\r\nshall be Chief Accountant (hereinafter called \"the Chief Accountant\").\r\nThese British Employes shall be nominated by the Corporation and the\r\nContractors, jointly, and shall be appointed by the Corporation.

The\r\nsalaries and other terms of Agreement of the Engineer-in-chief and the\r\nChief Accountant shall be arranged between the Corporation and the\r\nContractors; and the amount of their salaries, etc., shall be paid out\r\nof the general accounts of the Railway.\r\n\r\nFor all important technical appointments for the operation of the\r\nRailway, Europeans of experience and ability shall be engaged and\r\nwherever competent Chinese are available, they shall be employed.\r\nAll such appointments shall be made, and their functions defined,\r\nby the Managing Director and the Engineer-in-Chief in consultation,\r\nand shall be submitted for the approval of the Corporation; similar\r\nprocedure shall be followed in the case of Europeans employed in the\r\nChief Accountant's department. In the event of the misconduct, or\r\nthe incompetency of these European employes, their services may be\r\ndispensed with by the Managing Director, after consultation with the\r\nEngineer-in-Chief, and subject to the sanction of the Corporation. The\r\nform of Agreements made with these European Employes shall conform to\r\nthe usual practice.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the receipts and the disbursements of the Railway's\r\nconstruction and operation, shall be in Chinese and English in the\r\ndepartment of the Chief Accountant, whose duty it shall be to organize\r\nand supervise the same, and to report thereon for the information of\r\nthe Corporation through the Managing Director, and of the Contractors\r\nas representing the Bondholders.

SUN:\r\n\r\nI have read with great interest your sketch project for the\r\ninternational development of China as embodied in your letter\r\nof February first to me. I congratulate you upon the broad and\r\nstatesmanlike attitude with which you treat this very important\r\nsubject. Your suggestion of united international participation in the\r\ndevelopment of China's resources deserves the support of all friends\r\nof China. It would be unfortunate indeed if the old régime of spheres\r\nof influence, struggles for concessions and activities flavoring of\r\nselfish exploitation should not, with the conclusion of the war, be\r\nrelegated to the past. You are right in recognizing the necessity of\r\na substitute for the old order and your proposal of a unified policy\r\nunder international organization with Chinese participation for the\r\nlarger development in China, naturally assuming that the inalienable\r\nrights of the Chinese people are to be amply safeguarded, meets this\r\ndemand admirably.\r\n\r\nWe are hopeful that conditions in China may become such that the\r\nChinese people themselves may be encouraged to put their money into\r\nproductive enterprise and participate in the larger developments. We\r\nare hopeful that the day is not far distant when the Chinese Government\r\nmay be able actively to interest itself in the encouragement of native\r\nindustry to the end that native capital of which there is a very\r\nconsiderable quantity, may be induced to lend itself to productive\r\nenterprises, because of a Confidence in constructive policy on the part\r\nof the government.\r\n\r\nIf you will permit a suggestion, I would be inclined to reduce your\r\nadmirable program to one which would be in closer keeping with the\r\nlimits of the present world's resources in capital. As we all know\r\ndevastated Europe is calling for capital for rehabilitation and\r\nother nations want capital for development programs of considerable\r\nproportions. Thus it would seem that China's program of development\r\nmust of necessity take cognizance of her most immediate and most\r\npressing needs. We are all united in that transportation occupies a\r\nprominent place in such a program. 50,000 miles of railway and 100,000\r\nmiles of good roads would seem to be sufficient to engage our attention\r\nfor any plans for the immediate future. This would allow ample\r\nopportunity to penetrate the great rich unoccupied regions in the\r\nNorth and West, which should be opened to colonization and development\r\nas soon as possible in order to relieve the economic pressure of over\r\npopulation in sections along the coasts and waterways, and to accord\r\nopportunities to bring the rich regions of West China into contact with\r\nthe trade of the rest of China and the world at large.\r\n\r\nAlong with transportation, China needs to develop its resources in\r\niron and coal, the two great essentials to modern industrialism.\r\nArrangements should be made whereby foreign capital can come to China's\r\nassistance in these two important industries, but care should be\r\nexercised so as to preserve to China the iron and coal necessary for\r\nits own uses, and prevent China's steel industry being mortgaged to\r\nforeign interests, in a way so as to jeopardize China's future in this\r\nimportant industry.\r\n\r\nThe reform of the currency and reforms in internal tax administrations\r\nare questions of immediate importance to China's economic and\r\nindustrial development.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest fields of potentiality in the immediate demands\r\nof the New China, is agriculture. The country depends in its final\r\nanalysis upon the prosperity of its agriculture. At present probably\r\nas much as 80% of China's population is agricultural. China's\r\ngreatest problem is the proper feeding and clothing of its vast\r\npopulation. Improved conditions in agriculture, opening of new lands\r\nto cultivation, irrigation and conservancy works, the encouragement\r\nof the cattle and sheep industries, the development of the cotton\r\nindustry and the improvement of tea, silk and the seed crops of China,\r\nare timely subjects in any program of developments. There is a vast\r\nwork to be done in agriculture in China, which will lead to prosperity\r\ngenerally, and make possible developments with native capital in other\r\nfields of activity, whereas if agricultural improvements are neglected,\r\nit will be difficult to insure prosperity in other directions.\r\n\r\nThus for the present, I hope the main thought may be centered on\r\nimprovements in transportation, in currency and tax administrations, in\r\nthe development of coal and iron industries, and in agriculture. Many\r\nof the suggested activities included in your very extensive program\r\nwill follow as a corollary to the above.\r\n\r\nIn thinking of all these developments, I believe that we should always\r\ngive thought to the fact that we are not dealing with a new country\r\nbut with one in which social arrangements are exceedingly intricate\r\nand in which a long-tested system of agricultural and industrial\r\norganization exists. It is to my mind most important that the\r\ntransition to new methods of industry and labor should not be sudden\r\nbut that the old abilities and values should be gradually transmuted.\r\nIt is important that the artistic ability existing in the silk and\r\nporcelain manufacture, etc. should be maintained and fostered, and not\r\nsuperseded by cheaper processes. It is also highly important that no\r\nexport of food should be permitted, except as to clearly ascertained\r\nsurpluses of production. It would produce enormous suffering were the\r\nfood prices in China suddenly to be raised to the world market level.\r\nThe one factor in modern organization which the Chinese must learn\r\nbetter to understand is the corporation, and the fiduciary relationship\r\nwhich the officers of the corporation ought to occupy with respect to\r\nthe stockholders. If the Chinese cannot learn to use the corporation\r\nproperly, the organization of the national credit cannot be effected.\r\nHere, too, it is necessary that the capital of personal honesty which\r\nwas accumulated under the old system should not be lost but transferred\r\nto the new methods of doing business. So at every point where we\r\nare planning for a better and more efficient organization, it seems\r\nnecessary to hold on to the values created in the past and not to\r\ndisturb the entire balance of society by too sudden changes.\r\n\r\nI wish again to congratulate you upon the statesmanlike view with which\r\nyou consider the whole question of the development of your country,\r\nand the very timely suggestions you have to make in regard to a united\r\npolicy of international participation in these developments. I am\r\nglad to note that the minds of the leaders among the Chinese people\r\ntoday are being centered more and more upon the constructive needs of\r\nthe country and efforts are being made to meet these needs, in full\r\nappreciation of China's relations with the people of other nations, to\r\nthe end that China's developments in the future may work in harmony\r\nwith the world developments generally.\r\n\r\nI should be glad to hear from you further and more in detail concerning\r\ndevelopment plans.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, with the highest regard,\r\n\r\n Sincerely yours,\r\n         (Signed)\r\n     PAUL S.

Sun Yat Sen,\r\n 29 Rue Molière,\r\n Shanghai, China.\r\n\r\n YOUR EXCELLENCY:\r\n\r\nI have read with the greatest interest the project for the\r\nInternational Development of China enclosed in your letter of March\r\n17th, and agree with you that the economic development of China would\r\nbe of the greatest advantage, not only to China, but to the whole of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe plans you propose, however, are so complex and extensive that it\r\nwill take many years to work them out in detail. You doubtless are\r\nfully aware that it would take billions of dollars to carry out even\r\na small portion of your proposals and that most of them would not be\r\nable to pay interest charges and expenses of operation for some years.\r\nThe first question to be decided, therefore, is how the interest\r\ncharges on the necessary loans could be met. The revenues of the\r\nChinese Republic are already too heavily burdened with the interest\r\ncharges on existing Government loans to warrant further charges, and\r\nhence it would seem necessary for the present to limit the projects for\r\ndevelopment to those which seem sufficiently remunerative to attract\r\nprivate capital. The government of the United States has consistently\r\nendeavored to manifest its disinterested friendship for the people of\r\nChina and will undoubtedly coöperate in every proper way in proposals\r\nto advance their best interests.\r\n\r\nPlease accept my thanks for your kindness in submitting your proposals.\r\n\r\n Respectfully,\r\n         (Signed)\r\n   WILLIAM C. REDFIELD,\r\n       _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV\r\n\r\n\r\n            Il Ministro Delia Guerra\r\n\r\n            Rome, 17 Maggio, 1919.\r\n\r\n Most Honorable\r\n Sun Yat Sen,\r\n 29 Rue Molière,\r\n Shanghai, China.\r\n\r\n HONORABLE SIR:\r\n\r\nI thank you for having so kindly communicated to me the interesting\r\nproject regarding how to employ through an International Organization\r\nthe exuberant industrial activities created by the war, in order to\r\nexploit the great hidden riches of China.\r\n\r\nThough aware of the practical difficulties which present themselves\r\nin the accomplishment of this project, it meets with my utmost\r\nappreciation, I assure you, for the modern spirit by which it is\r\nanimated and for the depth of its conception.\r\n\r\nAccept my best wishes for complete success, in the advantage of your\r\nnoble country and for the interest of humanity.\r\n\r\n Believe Me,\r\n     Faithfully yours,\r\n       (Signed)\r\n         GENERAL CAVIGLIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX V\r\n\r\n\r\n            Peking, June 17, 1919.\r\n\r\n Hon. Sun Yat Sen,\r\n Shanghai.\r\n\r\n DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nPermit me as a professional railway man to express my pleasure with\r\nyour article appearing in the Far Eastern Review for June.\r\n\r\nI will not at this time express approval or disapproval of the route\r\nwhich you have chosen but the idea of a line to connect up the great\r\nagricultural interior with the densely populated coast appeals to me\r\nstrongly. I feel that you are making a definite contribution to railway\r\neconomic theory in this respect, whereas the line itself would relieve\r\ncongestion, open up a production area which would lower food costs,\r\nfurnish employment to large numbers of soldiers to be disbanded, and\r\nput in circulation a large amount of hard money which would go far to\r\ncorrect the currency situation.\r\n\r\nI am especially pleased to have your article appear at this time for\r\nI had already written one at the request of the publishers of the\r\nforthcoming \"Trans-Pacific\" magazine in which I touched upon the same\r\nline of thought. This will not appear until July and your opinions\r\nwill have done much to prepare the minds of sceptics upon the subject\r\nby that time.\r\n\r\nI trust that this intrusion of an entire stranger may be pardoned, and\r\nthat you will continue to support the thought which you have so ably\r\npresented.\r\n\r\n Very truly yours,\r\n           (Signed)\r\n             J. E. BAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VI\r\n\r\n\r\n            3, Piazza Del Popolo\r\n            Roma\r\n\r\n            August 30, 1919.\r\n\r\n Dr. Sun Yat Sen,\r\n 29 Rue Molière,\r\n Shanghai, China.\r\n\r\n MY DEAR DR. SUN YAT SEN:\r\n\r\nI thank you for your very kind letter of June 19th which has just\r\nbeen forwarded to me from my office in Rome, also for your kindness\r\nin sending me your splendid project \"To assist the Re-adjustment\r\nof Post-bellum Industries,\" and the program for \"The International\r\nDevelopment of China.\"\r\n\r\nI assure you I read your proposals and studied the maps in connection\r\nwith your able and logical argument with the deepest interest. And I\r\nbeg you to accept my hearty congratulations.\r\n\r\nI am entirely convinced that your noble _ideals will be_ realised, not\r\nonly for the benefit of China and the welfare of your own people, but\r\nfor the benefit and prosperity of the whole human race.\r\n\r\nThe Nations cannot continue to deny in the future as they have in the\r\npast, the unlimited natural resources of your rich fertile country, in\r\nfoods, minerals, coal and iron, etc.; and your plans for development\r\nand activity, as well as your methods of communication for expanding\r\nand cultivating almost untouched miles of virgin soil, and bringing\r\nthese products to the doors of the \"World Market\" by a practical and\r\neconomic plan, scientifically studied out, places you at once among\r\nthe very rare few unselfish humanitarian benefactors, and reveals so\r\nclearly your profound international sympathies.\r\n\r\nThe development of China's natural resources will give a new impetus\r\nand vitality to industry and commerce in your country and will not only\r\nbe of incalculable benefit to your own people, but offer undeniable\r\nand unlimited advantages to all people in all nations. Therefore\r\nGovernments and foreign financiers should not hesitate in giving your\r\nplans their most careful consideration and support, and come to your\r\nassistance in the realisation of your grand humanitarian project.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a great \"Northern Port\" on the Gulf of Pechili,\r\nand the building of a system of railways from this great Northern Port\r\nto the northwestern extremity of China, as well as the construction of\r\ncanals to connect the inland waterways systems of North and Central\r\nChina with the great \"Northern Port,\" and the development of coal and\r\niron fields in Shansi which would necessitate the construction of iron\r\nand steel works would not only offer employment to millions of your\r\ncountry people, but would open wider, and advantageously, the doors of\r\nthousands of well organised industries in many nations.\r\n\r\nIt is very encouraging to me, dear Dr. Sun Yat Sen, to know that you\r\nlook upon my plans of an \"International World Centre of Communication\"\r\nwith favor, and that you will further the idea among your countrymen by\r\nwriting about it in your magazine \"The Construction.\"\r\n\r\nThis city, erected upon neutral grounds would offer at once the\r\npractical framework for the essential needs of a League of Nations\r\nand could become its dignified \"Administrative Centre\" crowned by an\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nI have presented the plans and proposals of this World Centre to the\r\nRulers and governments of all nations, and hope to be able to go to\r\nWashington in October to exhibit the large original drawings and\r\npersonally explain the project from a practical and economic point\r\nof view before the foreign delegates who may meet there to assist in\r\nthe formation of a League of Nations, and I have written to President\r\nWilson, who after receiving the volumes containing the proposals and\r\nplans, wrote that \"he valued them very highly.\"\r\n\r\nI hope that in the very near future this International World Centre of\r\ncommunication may become a reality. It would be the means of clearly\r\ndefining and bringing into focus the highest natural products as well\r\nas the most important industrial achievements of all countries. This\r\naccomplishment would be one of the first definite steps toward more\r\nfriendly social and economic relations, and the practicability of\r\nestablishing such coöperation cannot be disputed.\r\n\r\nThis City of Peace should rise and stand as an International Monument,\r\nerected by international contribution to commemorate the heroic\r\nstruggle and noble sacrifice of millions who gave their lives on the\r\nbattle fields, in the air and on the sea, that justice should triumph\r\nand open the ways for humanity to progress in peace, and free from\r\ntyranny in the future.\r\n\r\nWith the assurance, dear Dr. Sun Yat Sen, of my most profound\r\nsympathies for your noble project, and with my deep gratitude for your\r\nkeen interest in my plans,\r\n\r\nI beg to remain, with high esteem\r\n\r\n Faithfully yours,\r\n     (Signed)\r\n   HENDRICK CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscribers' Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\nPossibly inconsistent spellings of names and place-names have been\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nInconsistent hyphenation and ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines\r\nwere retained.\r\n\r\n\"The Chochiang-Koria Line\" is spelled that way throughout the book.\r\n\r\nPage 195: \"Great Southern Port\" was printed as \"Greatern\"; changed here.\r\n\r\nPage 247: \"mileage\" was printed as \"milage\"; changed here.",
