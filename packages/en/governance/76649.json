This part of the state is made up of a\r\nseries of narrow valleys and high hills, some of which rank as mountains\r\nthat must reach an elevation of at least twenty-five hundred feet.\r\n\r\nIts westerly boundary is along the summit of the main range to where it\r\nfalls off into the watershed of Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver. At one point a little rill comes down a mountain until it strikes\r\na rock, where it divides, part running north into the Ottauquechee and\r\npart south into the Black River, both of which later turn easterly to\r\nreach the Connecticut.\r\n\r\nIn its natural state this territory was all covered with evergreen and\r\nhardwood trees. It had large deposits of limestone, occasionally mixed\r\nwith marble, and some granite. There were sporadic outcroppings of iron\r\nore, and the sands of some of the streams showed considerable traces of\r\ngold. The soil was hard and rocky, but when cultivated supported a good\r\ngrowth of vegetation.\r\n\r\nDuring colonial times this region lay in an unbroken wilderness, until\r\nthe coming of the French and Indian War, when a military road was cut\r\nthrough under the direction of General Amherst, running from\r\nCharlestown, New Hampshire, to Fort Ticonderoga, New York. This line of\r\nmarch lay through the south part of the town, crossing the Black River\r\nat the head of the two beautiful lakes and running over the hill towards\r\nthe valley of the Otter Creek.\r\n\r\nWhen settlers began to come in around the time of the Revolution, the\r\ngrandfather of my grandfather, Captain John Coolidge, located a farm\r\nnear the height of land westward from the river along this military\r\nroad, where he settled in about 1780.\r\n\r\nHe had served in the Revolutionary army and may have learned of this\r\nregion from some of his comrades who had known it in the old French\r\nwars, or who had passed over it in the campaign against Burgoyne, which\r\nculminated at Saratoga.\r\n\r\nHe had five children and acquired five farms, so that each of his\r\ndescendants was provided with a homestead. His oldest son Calvin came\r\ninto possession of the one which I now own, where it is said that\r\nCaptain John spent his declining years. He lies buried beside his wife\r\nin the little neighborhood cemetery not far distant.\r\n\r\nThe early settlers of Plymouth appear to have come mostly from\r\nMassachusetts, though some of them had stopped on the way in New\r\nHampshire. They were English Puritan stock, and their choice of a\r\nhabitation stamps them with a courageous pioneering spirit.\r\n\r\nTheir first buildings were log houses, the remains of which were visible\r\nin some places in my early boyhood, though they had long since been\r\ngiven over to the sheltering of domestic animals. The town must have\r\nsettled up with considerable rapidity, for as early as 1840 it had about\r\nfourteen hundred inhabitants scattered about the valleys and on the\r\nsides of the hills, which the mountains divided into a considerable\r\nnumber of different neighborhoods, each with a well-developed local\r\ncommunity spirit.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, much land was cleared of forest, very substantial\r\nbuildings of wood construction were erected, saw mills and grist mills\r\nwere located along the streams, and the sale of lumber and lime, farm\r\nproducts and domestic animals, brought considerable money into the town,\r\nwhich was laid out for improvements or found its way into the country\r\nstore. It was a hard but wholesome life, under which the people suffered\r\nmany privations and enjoyed many advantages, without any clear\r\nrealization of the existence of either one of them.\r\n\r\nThey were a hardy self-contained people. Most of them are gone now and\r\ntheir old homesteads are reverting to the wilderness. They went forth to\r\nconquer where the trees were thicker, the fields larger, and the\r\nproblems more difficult. I have seen their descendants scattered all\r\nover the country, especially in the middle west, and as far south as the\r\nGulf of Mexico and westward to the Pacific slope.\r\n\r\nIt was into this community that I was born on the 4th day of July, 1872.\r\nMy parents then lived in a five room, story and a half cottage attached\r\nto the post office and general store, of which my father was the\r\nproprietor. While they intended to name me for my father, they always\r\ncalled me Calvin, so the John became discarded.\r\n\r\nOur house was well shaded with maple trees and had a yard in front\r\nenclosed with a picket fence, in which grew a mountain ash, a plum tree,\r\nand the customary purple lilac bushes. In the summertime my mother\r\nplanted her flower bed there.\r\n\r\nHer parents, who were prosperous farmers, lived in the large house\r\nacross the road, which had been built for a hotel and still has the old\r\nhall in it where public dances were held in former days and a spacious\r\ncorner on the front side known as the bar room, indicating what had been\r\nsold there before my grandfather Moor bought the premises. On an\r\nadjoining farm, about sixty-five rods distant, lived my grandfather and\r\ngrandmother Coolidge. Within view were two more collections of farm\r\nbuildings, three dwelling houses with their barns, a church, a school\r\nhouse and a blacksmith shop. A little out of sight dwelt the local\r\nbutter tub maker and beyond him the shoemaker.\r\n\r\nThis locality was known as The Notch, being situated at the head of a\r\nvalley in an irregular bowl of hills. The scene was one of much natural\r\nbeauty, of which I think the inhabitants had little realization, though\r\nthey all loved it because it was their home and were always ready to\r\ncontend that it surpassed all the surrounding communities and compared\r\nfavorably with any other place on earth.\r\n\r\nMy sister Abbie was born in the same house in April, 1875. We lived\r\nthere until 1876, when the place was bought across the road, which had\r\nabout two acres of land with a house and a number of barns and a\r\nblacksmith shop. About it were a considerable number of good apple\r\ntrees. I think the price paid was $375. Almost at once the principal\r\nbarn was sold for $100, to be moved away. My father was a good trader.\r\n\r\nSome repairs were made on the inside, and black walnut furniture was\r\nbrought from Boston to furnish the parlor and sitting room. It was a\r\nplain square-sided house with a long ell, to which the horse barn was\r\nsoon added. The outside has since been remodeled and the piazza built. A\r\nyoung woman was always employed to do the house work. Whatever was\r\nneeded never failed to be provided.\r\n\r\nWhile in theory I was always urged to work and to save, in practice I\r\nwas permitted to do my share of playing and wasting. My playthings often\r\nlay in the road to be run over, and my ball game often interfered with\r\nmy filling the wood box. I have been taken out of bed to do penance for\r\nsuch derelictions.\r\n\r\nMy father, John Calvin Coolidge, ran the country store. He was\r\nsuccessful. The annual rent of the whole place was $40. I have heard him\r\nsay that his merchandise bills were about $10,000 yearly. He had no\r\nother expenses. His profits were about $100 per month on the average, so\r\nhe must have sold on a very close margin.\r\n\r\nHe trusted nearly everybody, but lost a surprisingly small amount.\r\nSometimes people he had not seen for years would return and pay him the\r\nwhole bill.\r\n\r\nHe went to Boston in the spring and fall to buy goods. He took the\r\nmidnight train from Ludlow when they did not have sleeping cars,\r\narriving in the city early in the morning, which saved him his hotel\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nHe was a good business man, a very hard worker, and did not like to see\r\nthings wasted. He kept the store about thirteen years and sold it to my\r\nmother’s brother, who became a prosperous merchant.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his business ability my father was very skillful with his\r\nhands. He worked with a carriage maker for a short time when he was\r\nyoung, and the best buggy he had for twenty years was one he made\r\nhimself. He had a complete set of tools, ample to do all kinds of\r\nbuilding and carpenter work. He knew how to lay bricks and was an\r\nexcellent stone mason.\r\n\r\nFollowing his sale of the store about the time my grandfather died,\r\nbesides running the farm, he opened the old blacksmith shop which stood\r\nupon the place across the road to which we had moved. He hired a\r\nblacksmith at $1 per day, who was a large-framed powerful man with a\r\nblack beard, said to be sometimes quarrelsome.\r\n\r\nI have seen him unaided throw a refractory horse to the ground when it\r\nobjected to being shod. But he was always kind to me, letting me fuss\r\naround the shop, leaving his own row to do three or four hills for me so\r\nthat I could more easily keep up with the rest of the men in hoeing\r\ntime, or favoring me in some way in the hay field as he helped on the\r\nfarm in busy times.\r\n\r\nHe always pitched the hay on to the ox cart and I raked after. If I was\r\ngetting behind he slowed up a little. He was a big-hearted man. I wish I\r\ncould see that blacksmith again. The iron work for farm wagons and sleds\r\nwas fashioned and put on in the shop, oxen and horses brought there for\r\nshoeing, and metal parts of farm implements often repaired. My father\r\nseemed to like to work in the shop, but did not go there much except\r\nwhen a difficult piece of work was required, like welding a broken steel\r\nsection rod of a mowing machine, which had to be done with great\r\nprecision or it would break again.\r\n\r\nHe kept tools for mending shoes and harnesses and repairing water pipes\r\nand tinware. He knew how to perform all kinds of delicate operations on\r\ndomestic animals. The lines he laid out were true and straight, and the\r\ncurves regular. The work he did endured.\r\n\r\nIf there was any physical requirement of country life which he could not\r\nperform, I do not know what it was. From watching him and assisting him,\r\nI gained an intimate knowledge of all this kind of work.\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible that any man could adequately describe his mother. I\r\ncan not describe mine.\r\n\r\nOn the side of her father, Hiram Dunlap Moor, she was Scotch with a\r\nmixture of Welsh and English. Her mother, Abigail (Franklin) Moor, was\r\nchiefly of the old New England stock. She bore the name of two\r\nEmpresses, Victoria Josephine. She was of a very light and fair\r\ncomplexion with a rich growth of brown hair that had a glint of gold in\r\nit. Her hands and features were regular and finely modeled. The older\r\npeople always told me how beautiful she was in her youth.\r\n\r\nShe was practically an invalid ever after I could remember her, but used\r\nwhat strength she had in lavish care upon me and my sister, who was\r\nthree years younger. There was a touch of mysticism and poetry in her\r\nnature which made her love to gaze at the purple sunsets and watch the\r\nevening stars.\r\n\r\nWhatever was grand and beautiful in form and color attracted her. It\r\nseemed as though the rich green tints of the foliage and the blossoms of\r\nthe flowers came for her in the springtime, and in the autumn it was for\r\nher that the mountain sides were struck with crimson and with gold.\r\n\r\nWhen she knew that her end was near she called us children to her\r\nbedside, where we knelt down to receive her final parting blessing.\r\n\r\nIn an hour she was gone. It was her thirty-ninth birthday. I was twelve\r\nyears old. We laid her away in the blustering snows of March. The\r\ngreatest grief that can come to a boy came to me. Life was never to seem\r\nthe same again.\r\n\r\nFive years and forty-one years later almost to a day my sister and my\r\nfather followed her. It always seemed to me that the boy I lost was her\r\nimage. They all rest together on the sheltered hillside among five\r\ngenerations of the Coolidge family.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, Calvin Galusha Coolidge, died when I was six years old.\r\nHe was a spare man over six feet tall, of a nature which caused people\r\nto confide in him, and of a character which made him a constant choice\r\nfor public office. His mother and her family showed a marked trace of\r\nIndian blood. I never saw her, but he took me one time to see her\r\nsister, his very aged aunt, whom we found sitting in the chimney corner\r\nsmoking a clay pipe.\r\n\r\nThis was so uncommon that I always remembered it. I thought tobacco was\r\nonly for men, though I had seen old ladies outside our neighborhood buy\r\nsnuff at the store.\r\n\r\nHe was an expert horseman and loved to raise colts and puppies. He kept\r\npeacocks and other gay-colored fowl and had a yard and garden filled\r\nwith scarlet flowers. But he never cared to hunt or fish. He found great\r\namusement in practical jokes and could entice a man into a nest of bees\r\nand make him think he went there of his own accord.\r\n\r\nHe and my grandmother brought up as their own children the boy and girl\r\nof his only sister, whose parents died when they were less than two\r\nyears old. He made them no charge, but managed their inheritance and\r\nturned it all over to them with the income, besides giving the boy $800\r\nof his own money when he was eighteen years old, the same as he did my\r\nfather. He was fond of riding horseback and taught me to ride standing\r\nup behind him. Some of the horses he bred and sold became famous. In his\r\nmind, the only real, respectable way to get a living was from tilling\r\nthe soil. He therefore did not exactly approve having his son go into\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIn order to tie me to the land, in his last sickness he executed a deed\r\nto me for life of forty acres, called the Lime Kiln lot, on the west\r\npart of his farm, with the remainder to my lineal descendants, thinking\r\nthat as I could not sell it, and my creditors could not get it, it would\r\nbe necessary for me to cultivate it. He also gave me a mare colt and a\r\nheifer calf, which came of stock that had belonged to his grandfather.\r\n\r\nTwo days after I was two months old, my father was elected to the state\r\nlegislature. By a curious coincidence, when my son was the same age I\r\nwas elected to the same office in Massachusetts. He was reelected twice,\r\nthe term being two years, and, while he was serving, my grandfather\r\ntook my mother and me to visit him at Montpelier.\r\n\r\nI think I was three years and four months old, but I always remembered\r\nthe experience. Grandfather carried me to the State House and sat me in\r\nthe Governor’s chair, which did not impress me so much as a stuffed\r\ncatamount that was in the capital museum. That was the first of the\r\ngreat many journeys which I have since made to legislative halls.\r\n\r\nDuring his last illness he would have me read to him the first chapter\r\nof the Gospel of John, which he had read to his grandfather. I could do\r\nvery well until I came to the word “comprehended,” with which I always\r\nhad difficulty. On taking the oath as President in 1925, I placed my\r\nhand on that Book of the Bible in memory of my first reading it.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, neither he nor any other members of my family ever\r\nentertained any ambitions in my behalf. He evidently wished me to stay\r\non the land. My own wish was to keep store, as my father had done.\r\n\r\nThey all taught me to be faithful over a few things. If they had any\r\nidea that such a training might some day make me a ruler over many\r\nthings, it was not disclosed to me. It was my father in later years who\r\nwished me to enter the law, but when I finally left home for that\r\npurpose the parting was very hard for him to bear.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood around The Notch was made up of people of exemplary\r\nhabits. Their speech was clean and their lives were above reproach. They\r\nhad no mortgages on their farms. If any debts were contracted they were\r\npromptly paid. Credit was good and there was money in the savings bank.\r\n\r\nThe break of day saw them stirring. Their industry continued until\r\ntwilight. They kept up no church organization, and as there was little\r\nregular preaching the outward manifestation of religion through public\r\nprofession had little opportunity, but they were without exception a\r\npeople of faith and charity and of good works. They cherished the\r\nteachings of the Bible and sought to live in accordance with its\r\nprecepts.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the young people was modest and respectful. For most of\r\nthe time during my boyhood regular Sunday school classes were held in\r\nthe church which my grandmother Coolidge superintended until in her\r\nadvanced years she was superseded by my father. She was a constant\r\nreader of the Bible and a devoted member of the church, who daily sought\r\nfor divine guidance in prayer.\r\n\r\nI stayed with her at the farm much of the time and she had much to do\r\nwith shaping the thought of my early years. She had a benign influence\r\nover all who came in contact with her. The Puritan severity of her\r\nconvictions was tempered by the sweetness of a womanly charity. There\r\nwere none whom she ever knew that had not in some way benefited by her\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nHer maiden name was Sarah Almeda Brewer. When she married my grandfather\r\nshe was twenty and he was twenty-eight years old. She was accustomed to\r\ntell me that from his experience and observations he had come to have\r\ngreat faith in good blood, and that he chose her for his wife not only\r\nbecause he loved her, but because her family, which he had seen for\r\nthree generations, were people of ability and character.\r\n\r\nWhile he would have looked upon rank as only pretense, he looked upon\r\nmerit with great respect. His judgment was vindicated by the fact that\r\nmore of her kin folks than he could have realized had been and were to\r\nbecome people of merited distinction.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing dress in our neighborhood was that of the countryside.\r\nWhile my father wore a business suit with a white shirt, collar and\r\ncuffs, which he always kept clean, the men generally had colored shirts\r\nand outer garments of brown or blue drilling. But they all had good\r\nclothes for any important occasions.\r\n\r\nI was clad in a gingham shirt with overalls in the summer, when I liked\r\nto go barefooted. In the winter these were changed for heavy wool\r\ngarments and thick cowhide boots, which lasted a year.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother Coolidge spun woolen yarn, from which she knitted us\r\nstockings and mittens. I have seen her weave cloth, and when I was ten\r\nyears old I had a frock which came from her loom. We had linen sheets\r\nand table cloths and woolen bed blankets, which she had spun and woven\r\nin earlier days. I have some of them now. My grandfather Coolidge wore\r\na blue woolen frock much of the time, which is a most convenient garment\r\nfor that region. It is cut like a shirt, going on over the head, with\r\nflaps that reach to the knees.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to visit the old home in later years I liked to wear the one\r\nhe left, with some fine calfskin boots about two sizes too large for me,\r\nwhich were made for him when he went to the Vermont legislature about\r\n1858. When news pictures began to be taken of me there, I found that\r\namong the public this was generally supposed to be a makeup costume,\r\nwhich it was not, so I have since been obliged to forego the comfort of\r\nwearing it. In public life it is sometimes necessary in order to appear\r\nreally natural to be actually artificial.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some glimpse of these pictures may have caused an English writer\r\nto refer to me as a Vermont backwoodsman. I wonder if he describes his\r\nKing as a Scotchman when he sees him in kilts.\r\n\r\nTo those of his country who remember that Burgoyne sent home a dispatch\r\nsaying that the Green Mountains were the abode of the most warlike race\r\non the continent, who hung like a thunder cloud on his left--which was\r\nfully borne out by what they helped to do to him at Bennington and\r\nSaratoga--I presume the term of Vermont backwoodsman still carries the\r\nimplication of reproach. But in this country it is an appellation which\r\nfrom General Ethan Allen to Admiral George Dewey has not been without\r\nsome distinction.\r\n\r\nWhile the form of government under which the Plymouth people lived was\r\nthat of a republic, it had a strong democratic trend. The smallest unit\r\nwas then the school district. Early in my boyhood the women were given a\r\nvote on school questions in both the district and town meetings.\r\n\r\nThe district meeting was held in the evening at the school house each\r\nyear. The officers were chosen and the rate of the school tax was fixed\r\nby popular vote. The board and room of the teacher for two-week periods\r\nwas then assigned to the lowest bidders. The rates ran from about fifty\r\ncents each week in the summer to as high as $1.25 in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe town officers were chosen annually at the March meeting. Here again\r\nthe rate of taxes was fixed by popular vote. The bonded debt was rather\r\nlarge, coming down, as I was told, from expenses during the war and the\r\ncosts of reconstructing roads and bridges after the disastrous freshet\r\nof 1869.\r\n\r\nThe more substantial farmers wanted to raise a large tax to reduce the\r\ndebt. I noticed my father did not vote on this subject and I inquired\r\nhis reason. He said that while he could afford to pay a high rate, he\r\ndid not wish to place so large a burden on those who were less able, and\r\nso was leaving them to make their own decision.\r\n\r\nIn those days there were about two hundred and fifty qualified voters,\r\nnot over twenty-five of which were Democrats, and the rest Republicans.\r\nThey had their spirited contests in their elections, but not along party\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nOne of the patriarchs of the town, who was a Democrat, served many years\r\nas Moderator by unanimous choice. He was a man of sound common sense and\r\nan excellent presiding officer, but without much book learning.\r\n\r\nWhen he read that part of the call for the meeting which recited that it\r\nwas to act “on the following questions, _viz._,” he always read it “to\r\nact upon the following questions, _vizley_.” This caused him to be\r\nreferred to at times by the irreverent as Old Vizley.\r\n\r\nI was accustomed to carry apples and popcorn balls to the town meetings\r\nto sell, mainly because my grandmother said my father had done so when\r\nhe was a boy, and I was exceedingly anxious to grow up to be like him.\r\n\r\nOn the even years in September came the Freemen’s meeting. This was a\r\nstate election, at which the town representative to the legislature was\r\nchosen. They also voted for county and state officers and for a\r\nRepresentative to the Congress, and on each fourth year for Presidential\r\nelectors. I attended all of these meetings until I left home and\r\nfollowed them with interest for many of the succeeding years.\r\n\r\nCareful provision was made for the administration of justice through\r\nlocal authorities. Those charged with petty crimes and misdemeanors were\r\nbrought before one of the five Justices of the Peace, who had power to\r\ntry and sentence with or without calling a jury. He also had a like\r\njurisdiction in civil matters of a small amount.\r\n\r\nThe more important cases, criminal and civil, went to the County Court\r\nwhich sat in the neighboring town of Woodstock in May and December. My\r\nfather was nearly all his life a Constable or a Deputy Sheriff, and\r\nsometimes both, with power to serve civil and criminal process, so that\r\nhe arrested those charged with crime and brought them before the Justice\r\nfor trial.\r\n\r\nUnless it would keep me out of school, he would take me with him when\r\nattending before the local justices or when he went to the opening\r\nsession of the County Court. Before him my grandfather had held the same\r\npositions, so that together they were the peace officers most of the\r\ntime in our town for nearly seventy-five years.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this they often settled the estates of deceased persons\r\nand acted as guardian of minors. This business was transacted in the\r\nProbate Court, where I often went.\r\n\r\nMy father was at times a Justice of the Peace and always had a\r\ncommission as notary public. This enabled him to take the acknowledgment\r\nof deeds, which he knew how to draw, and administer oaths necessary to\r\npension papers which he filled out for old soldiers usually without\r\ncharge, or to take affidavits required on any other instruments.\r\n\r\nIn my youth he was also always engaged in the transaction of all kinds\r\nof town business, being constantly elected for that purpose. He was\r\npainstaking, precise and very accurate, and had such wide experience\r\nthat the lawyers of the region knew they could rely on him to serve\r\npapers in difficult cases and make returns that would be upheld by the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nThis work gave him such a broad knowledge of the practical side of the\r\nlaw that people of the neighborhood were constantly seeking his advice,\r\nto which I always listened with great interest. He always counseled them\r\nto resist injustice and avoid unfair dealing, but to keep their\r\nagreements, meet their obligations and observe strict obedience to the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nBy reason of what I saw and heard in my early life, I came to have a\r\ngood working knowledge of the practical side of government. I understood\r\nthat it consisted of restraints which the people had imposed upon\r\nthemselves in order to promote the common welfare.\r\n\r\nAs I went about with my father when he collected taxes, I knew that when\r\ntaxes were laid some one had to work to earn the money to pay them. I\r\nsaw that a public debt was a burden on all the people in a community,\r\nand while it was necessary to meet the needs of a disaster it cost much\r\nin interest and ought to be retired as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAfter the winter work of laying in a supply of wood had been done, the\r\nfarm year began about the first of April with the opening of the\r\nmaple-sugar season. This was the most interesting of all the farm\r\noperations to me.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the first warm days we broke a road through the deep\r\nsnow into the sugar lot, tapped the trees, set the buckets, and brought\r\nthe sap to the sugar house, where in a heater and pans it was boiled\r\ndown into syrup to be taken to the house for sugaring off. We made eight\r\nhundred to two thousand pounds, according to the season.\r\n\r\nAfter that the fences had to be repaired where they had been broken down\r\nby the snow, the cattle turned out to pasture, and the spring planting\r\ndone. Then came sheep-shearing time, which was followed by getting in\r\nthe hay, harvesting and threshing of the grain, cutting and husking the\r\ncorn, digging the potatoes and picking the apples. Just before\r\nThanksgiving the poultry had to be dressed for market, and a little\r\nlater the fattened hogs were butchered and the meat salted down. Early\r\nin the winter a beef creature was slaughtered.\r\n\r\nThe work of the farm was done by the oxen, except running the mowing\r\nmachine and horse rake. I early learned to drive oxen and used to plow\r\nwith them alone when I was twelve years old. Of course, there was the\r\nconstant care of the domestic animals, the milking of the cows, and\r\ntaking them to and from pasture, which was especially my responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe had husking bees, apple-paring bees and singing schools in the\r\nwinter. There were parties for the young folks and an occasional\r\ndramatic exhibition by local talent. Not far away there were some public\r\ndances, which I was never permitted to attend.\r\n\r\nSome time during the summer we usually went to the circus, often rising\r\nby three o’clock so as to get there early. In the autumn we visited the\r\ncounty fair. The holidays were all celebrated in some fashion.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Fourth of July meant a great deal to me, because it was\r\nmy birthday. The first one I can remember was when I was four years old.\r\nMy father took me fishing in the meadow brook in the morning. I recall\r\nthat I fell in the water, after which we had a heavy thundershower, so\r\nthat we both came home very wet. Usually there was a picnic celebration\r\non that day.\r\n\r\nThanksgiving was a feast day for family reunions at the home of the\r\ngrandparents. Christmas was a sacrament observed with the exchange of\r\ngifts, when the stockings were hung, and the spruce tree was lighted in\r\nthe symbol of Christian faith and love. While there was plenty of hard\r\nwork, there was no lack of pleasurable diversion.\r\n\r\nWhen the work was done for the day, it was customary to drop into the\r\nstore to get the evening mail and exchange views on topics of interest.\r\nA few times I saw there Attorney General John G. Sargent with his\r\nfather, who was a much respected man.\r\n\r\nA number of those who came had followed Sheridan, been with Meade at\r\nGettysburg, and served under Grant, but they seldom volunteered any\r\ninformation about it. They were not talkative and took their military\r\nservice in a matter of fact way, not as anything to brag about but\r\nmerely as something they did because it ought to be done.\r\n\r\nThey drew no class distinctions except towards those who assumed\r\nsuperior airs. Those they held in contempt. They held strongly to the\r\ndoctrine of equality. Whenever the hired man or the hired girl wanted to\r\ngo anywhere they were always understood to be entitled to my place in\r\nthe wagon, in which case I remained at home. This gave me a very early\r\ntraining in democratic ideas and impressed upon me very forcibly the\r\ndignity and power, if not the superiority of labor.\r\n\r\nIt was all a fine atmosphere in which to raise a boy. As I look back on\r\nit I constantly think how clean it was. There was little about it that\r\nwas artificial. It was all close to nature and in accordance with the\r\nways of nature. The streams ran clear. The roads, the woods, the fields,\r\nthe people--all were clean. Even when I try to divest it of the halo\r\nwhich I know always surrounds the past, I am unable to create any other\r\nimpression than that it was fresh and clean.\r\n\r\nWe had some books, but not many. Mother liked poetry and read some\r\nnovels. Father had no taste for books, but always took and read a daily\r\npaper. My grandfather Moor read books and papers, so that he was a\r\nwell-informed man.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother Coolidge liked books and besides a daily Chapter in the\r\nBible read aloud to me “The Rangers or the Tory’s Daughter” and “The\r\nGreen Mountain Boys,” which were both stories of the early settlers of\r\nVermont during the Revolutionary period. She also had two volumes\r\nentitled “Washington and His Generals,” and other biographies which I\r\nread myself at an early age with a great deal of interest.\r\n\r\nAt home there were numerous law books. In this way I grew up with a\r\nworking knowledge of the foundations of my state and nation and a taste\r\nfor history.\r\n\r\nMy education began with a set of blocks which had on them the Roman\r\nnumerals and the letters of the alphabet. It is not yet finished. As I\r\nplayed with\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nAllison Spence\r\n\r\nVICTORIA JOSEPHINE (MOOR) COOLIDGE\r\n\r\n_Mother of Calvin Coolidge, about the time of her marriage_]\r\n\r\nthem and asked my mother what they were, I came to know them all when I\r\nwas three years old. I started to school when I was five.\r\n\r\nThe little stone school house which had unpainted benches and desks wide\r\nenough to seat two was attended by about twenty-five scholars. Few, if\r\nany, of my teachers reached the standard now required by all public\r\nschools. They qualified by examination before the town superintendent. I\r\nfirst took this examination and passed it at the age of thirteen and my\r\nsister Abbie passed it and taught a term of school in a neighboring town\r\nwhen she was twelve years old.\r\n\r\nMy teachers were young women from neighboring communities, except\r\nsometimes when a man was employed for the winter term. They were all\r\nintelligent, of good character, and interested in their work. I do not\r\nfeel that the quality of their instruction was in any way inferior. The\r\ncommon school subjects were taught, with grammar and United States\r\nhistory, so that when I was thirteen I had mastered them all and went to\r\nBlack River Academy, at Ludlow.\r\n\r\nThat was one of the greatest events of my life. The packing and\r\npreparation for it required more time and attention than collecting my\r\nbelongings in preparation for leaving the White House. I counted the\r\nhours until it was time to go.\r\n\r\nMy whole outfit went easily into two small handbags, which lay on the\r\nstraw in the back of the traverse sleigh beside the fatted calf that was\r\nstarting to market. The winter snow lay on the ground. The weather was\r\nwell below freezing. But in my eagerness these counted for nothing.\r\n\r\nI was going where I would be mostly my own master. I was casting off\r\nwhat I thought was the drudgery of farm life, symbolized by the cowhide\r\nboots and every-day clothing which I was leaving behind, not realizing\r\nwhat a relief it would be to return to them in future years. I had on my\r\nbest clothes and wore shoes with rubbers, because the village had\r\nsidewalks.\r\n\r\nI did not know that there were mental and moral atmospheres more\r\nmonotonous and more contaminating than anything in the physical\r\natmosphere of country life. No one could have made me believe that I\r\nshould never be so innocent or so happy again.\r\n\r\nAs we rounded the brow of the hill the first rays of the morning sun\r\nstreamed over our backs and lighted up the glistening snow ahead. I was\r\nperfectly certain that I was traveling out of the darkness into the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWe have much speculation over whether the city or the country is the\r\nbetter place to bring up boys. I am prejudiced in behalf of the country,\r\nbut I should have to admit that much depends on the parents and the\r\nsurrounding neighborhood. We felt the cold in winter and had many\r\ninconveniences, but we did not mind them because we supposed they were\r\nthe inevitable burdens of existence.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to imagine better surroundings for the development of a\r\nboy than those which I had. While a wider breadth of training and\r\nknowledge could have been presented to me, there was a daily contact\r\nwith many new ideas, and the mind was given sufficient opportunity\r\nthoroughly to digest all that came to it.\r\n\r\nCountry life does not always have breadth, but it has depth. It is\r\nneither artificial nor superficial, but is kept close to the realities.\r\n\r\nWhile I can think of many pleasures we did not have, and many niceties\r\nof culture with which we were unfamiliar, yet if I had the power to\r\norder my life anew I would not dare to change that period of it. If it\r\ndid not afford me the best that there was, it abundantly provided the\r\nbest that there was for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEKING AN EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\nSEEKING AN EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the sages of New England is reported to have declared that the\r\neducation of a child should begin several generations before it is born.\r\nNo doubt it does begin at a much earlier period and we enter life with a\r\nheritage that reaches back through the ages. But we do not choose our\r\nancestors. When we come into the world the gate of gifts is closed\r\nbehind us. We can do nothing about it. So far as each individual is\r\nconcerned all he can do is to take the abilities he has and make the\r\nmost of them. His power over the past is gone. His power over the future\r\ndepends on what he does with himself in the present. If he wishes to\r\nlive and progress he must work.\r\n\r\nDuring early childhood the inspiration for anything like mental\r\ndiscipline comes almost entirely from the outside. It is supplied by the\r\nparents and teachers. It was not until I left home in February of 1886\r\nthat I could say I had much thought of my own about getting an\r\neducation. Thereafter I began to be more dependent on myself and assume\r\nmore and more self-direction. What I studied was the result of my own\r\nchoice. Instead of seeking to direct me, my father left me to decide.\r\nBut when I had selected a course he was always solicitous to see that I\r\ndiligently applied myself to it.\r\n\r\nGoing away to school was my first great adventure in life. I shall never\r\nforget the impression it made on me. It was so deep and remains so vivid\r\nthat whenever I have started out on a new enterprise a like feeling\r\nalways returns to me. It was the same when I went to college, when I\r\nleft home to enter the law, when I began a public career in Boston, when\r\nI started for Washington to become Vice-President and finally when I was\r\ncalled to the White House. Going to the Academy meant a complete break\r\nwith the past and entering a new and untried field, larger and more\r\nalluring than the past, among unknown scenes and unknown people.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1886 Black River Academy had just celebrated its\r\nfiftieth anniversary. While it had some distinguished alumni, the great\r\nbody of its former students were the hard-working, every-day people,\r\nthat made the strength of rural New England. My father and mother and\r\ngrandmother Coolidge had been there a few terms. While it had a charter\r\nof its own, and was independent of the public authorities, it was\r\nnevertheless part village high school. At its head was a principal, who\r\nhad under him two women assistants. A red brick structure, built like a\r\nchurch, with an assembly room and a few recitation rooms made up its\r\nentire equipment, so that those who did not live at home boarded in\r\nprivate families about the town of Ludlow. The spring term began in\r\nmidwinter in order that the girls could be out by the first Monday in\r\nMay to teach a summer district school and the boys could get home for\r\nthe season’s work on the farm.\r\n\r\nFor the very few who were preparing for college a classical course was\r\noffered in Latin, Greek, history and mathematics, but most of the pupils\r\nkept to the Latin Scientific, and the English courses. The student body\r\nwas about one hundred and twenty-five in number. During my first term I\r\nbegan algebra and finished grammar. For some reason I was attracted to\r\ncivil government and took that. This was my first introduction to the\r\nConstitution of the United States. Although I was but thirteen years old\r\nthe subject interested me exceedingly. The study of it which I then\r\nbegan has never ceased, and the more I study it the more I have come to\r\nadmire it, realizing that no other document devised by the hand of man\r\never brought so much progress and happiness to humanity. The good it has\r\nwrought can never be measured.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone the school with its teachers, its students and courses\r\nof study that interested me, but also the village and its people. It all\r\nlay in a beautiful valley along the Black River supported on either side\r\nby high hills. The tradespeople all knew my father well and he had an\r\nintimate acquaintance with the lawyers. Very soon I too knew them all.\r\nThe chief industry of the town was a woolen mill that always remained a\r\nmystery to me. But the lesser activity of the village was a cab shop. I\r\nworked there some on Saturdays, so I came to know how toys and baby\r\nwagons were made. It was my first acquaintance with the factory system,\r\nand my approach to it was that of a wage earner. As I was employed at\r\npiece work my wages depended on my own ability, skill and industry. It\r\nwas a good training. I was beginning to find out what existence meant.\r\n\r\nMy real academy course began the next fall term when I started to study\r\nLatin. In a few weeks I broke my right arm but it did not keep me out of\r\nschool more than two days. Latin was not difficult for me to translate,\r\nbut I never became proficient in its composition. Although I continued\r\nit until my sophomore year at college the only part of all the course\r\nthat I found of much interest was the orations of Cicero. These held my\r\nattention to such a degree that I translated some of them in later life.\r\n\r\nWhen Greek was begun the next year I found it difficult. It is a\r\nlanguage that requires real attention and close application. Among its\r\nrewards are the moving poetry of Homer, the marvelous orations of\r\nDemosthenes, and in after life an increased power of observation.\r\n\r\nBesides the classics we had a course in rhetoric, some ancient history,\r\nand a little American literature. Plane geometry completed our\r\nmathematics. In the modern languages there was only French.\r\n\r\nIn some subjects I began with the class when it started to review and so\r\ndid the work of a term in two weeks. I joined the French class in mid\r\nyear and made up the work by starting my study at about three o’clock in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nDuring the long vacations from May until September I went home and\r\nworked on the farm. We had a number of horses so that I was able to\r\nindulge my pleasure in riding. As no one else in the neighborhood cared\r\nfor this diversion I had to ride alone. But a horse is much company, and\r\nriding over the fields and along the country roads by himself, where\r\nnothing interrupts his seeing and thinking, is a good occupation for a\r\nboy. The silences of Nature have a discipline all their own.\r\n\r\nOf course our school life was not free from pranks. The property of the\r\ntownspeople was moved to strange places in the night. One morning as the\r\njanitor was starting the furnace he heard a loud bray from one of the\r\nclass rooms. His investigation disclosed the presence there of a\r\ndomestic animal noted for his long ears and discordant voice. In some\r\nway during the night he had been stabled on the second floor. About as\r\nfar as I deem it prudent to discuss my own connection with these\r\nescapades is to record that I was never convicted of any of them and so\r\nmust be presumed innocent.\r\n\r\nThe expenses at the Academy were very moderate. The tuition was about\r\nseven dollars for each term, and board and room for each week not over\r\nthree dollars. Oftentimes students hired a room for about fifty cents\r\nper week and boarded themselves. In my own case the cost for a school\r\nyear averaged about one hundred and fifty dollars, which was all paid by\r\nmy father. Any money I earned he had me put in the savings bank, because\r\nhe wished me to be informed of the value of money at interest. He\r\nthought money invested in that way led to a self-respecting independence\r\nthat was one of the foundations of good character.\r\n\r\nIt was about twelve miles from Ludlow to Plymouth. Sometimes I walked\r\nhome Friday afternoon, but usually my father came for me and brought me\r\nback Sunday evening or Monday morning. When this was not done I often\r\nstaid with the elder sister of my mother, Mrs. Don C. Pollard, who lived\r\nabout three miles down the river at Proctorsville. This was my Aunt\r\nSarah who is still living. She was wonderfully kind to me and did all\r\nshe could to take the place of my own mother in affection for me and\r\ngood influence over me while I was at the Academy and ever after. The\r\nsweetness of her nature was a benediction to all who came in contact\r\nwith her. What men owe to the love and help of good women can never be\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nThe Academy had no athletics in those days, as the boys from the farms\r\ndid not feel the need of such activity. A few games of baseball were\r\nplayed, but no football or track athletics were possible. Games did not\r\ninterest me much though I had some skill with a bat. I was rather\r\nslender and not so tall as many boys of my age.\r\n\r\nThose who attended the school from out of town were all there with a\r\nreal purpose of improving themselves, so that while there was no lack of\r\nfun and play they all worked as best they could, for their coming had\r\nmeant too much sacrifice at home not to be taken seriously. They had\r\ncome seeking to better their condition in life through what they might\r\nlearn and the self-discipline they might secure.\r\n\r\nThe school had much to be desired in organization and equipment, but it\r\npossessed a sturdy spirit and a wholesome regard for truth. Of course\r\nthe student body came from the country and had country ways, but the\r\nboys were inspired with a purpose, and the girls with a sweet sincerity\r\nwhich becomes superior to all the affectations of the drawing-room. In\r\nthem the native capacity for making real men and women remained all\r\nunspoiled.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential election of 1888 created considerable interest among\r\nthe students. Most of them favored the Republican candidate Benjamin\r\nHarrison against the then President Grover Cleveland. When Harrison was\r\nelected, two nights were spent parading the streets with drums and\r\ntrumpets, celebrating the victory.\r\n\r\nDuring most of my course George Sherman was the principal and Miss M.\r\nBelle Chellis was the first assistant. I owe much to the inspiration and\r\nscholarly direction which they gave to my undergraduate days. They both\r\nlived to see me President and sent me letters at the time, though they\r\nleft the school long ago. It was under their teaching that I first\r\nlearned of the glory and grandeur of the ancient civilization that grew\r\nup around the Mediterranean and in Mesopotamia. Under their guidance I\r\nbeheld the marvels of old Babylon, I marched with the Ten Thousand of\r\nXenophon, I witnessed the conflict around beleaguered Troy which doomed\r\nthat proud city to pillage and to flames, I heard the tramp of the\r\ninvincible legions of Rome, I saw the victorious galleys of the Eternal\r\nCity carrying destruction to the Carthaginian shore, and I listened to\r\nthe lofty eloquence of Cicero and the matchless imagery of Homer. They\r\ngave me a vision of the world when it was young and showed me how it\r\ngrew. It seems to me that it is almost impossible for those who have not\r\ntraveled that road to reach a very clear conception of what the world\r\nnow means.\r\n\r\nIt was in this period that I learned something of the thread of events\r\nthat ran from the Euphrates and the Nile through Athens to the Tiber and\r\nthence stretched on to the Seine and the Thames to be carried overseas\r\nto the James, the Charles and the Hudson. I found that the English\r\nlanguage was generously compounded with Greek and Latin, which it was\r\nnecessary to know if I was to understand my native tongue. I discovered\r\nthat our ideas of democracy came from the agora of Greece, and our ideas\r\nof liberty came from the forum of Rome. Something of the sequence of\r\nhistory was revealed to me, so that I began to understand the\r\nsignificance of our own times and our own country.\r\n\r\nIn March of my senior year my sister Abbie died. She was three years my\r\njunior but so proficient in her studies that she was but two classes\r\nbelow me in school. She was ill scarcely a week. Several doctors were in\r\nattendance but could not save her. Thirty years later one of them told\r\nme he was convinced she had appendicitis, which was a disease not well\r\nunderstood in 1890. I went home when her condition became critical and\r\nstaid beside her until she passed to join our mother. The memory of the\r\ncharm of her presence and her dignified devotion to the right will\r\nalways abide with me.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1890 came my graduation. The class had five boys and\r\nfour girls. With so small a number it was possible for all of us to take\r\npart in the final exercises with orations and essays. The subject that I\r\nundertook to discuss was “Oratory in History,” in which I dealt briefly\r\nwith the effect of the spoken word in determining human action.\r\n\r\nIt had been my thought, as I was but seventeen, to spend a year in some\r\nof the larger preparatory schools and then enter a university. But it\r\nwas suddenly decided that a smaller college would be preferable, so I\r\nwent to Amherst. On my way there I contracted a heavy cold, which grew\r\nworse, interfering with my examinations, and finally sent me home where\r\nI was ill for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nBut by early winter I was recovered, so that I did a good deal of work\r\nhelping repair and paint the inside of the store building which my\r\nfather still owned and rented. There was time for much reading and I\r\ngave great attention to the poems of Sir Walter Scott. After a few weeks\r\nin the late winter at my old school I went to St. Johnsbury Academy for\r\nthe spring term. Its principal was Dr. Putney, who was a fine\r\ndrill-master, a very exact scholar, and\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nAllison Spence\r\n\r\nCOLONEL JOHN C. COOLIDGE\r\n\r\n_While in the Vermont Senate_]\r\n\r\nan excellent disciplinarian. He readily gave me a certificate entitling\r\nme to enter Amherst without further examination, which he would never\r\nhave done if he had not been convinced I was a proficient student. His\r\nindorsement of the work I had already done, after having me in his own\r\nclasses for a term, showed that Black River Academy was not without some\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer vacation my father and I went to the dedication of the\r\nBennington Battle Monument. It was a most elaborate ceremony with much\r\noratory followed by a dinner and more speaking, with many bands of music\r\nand a long military parade. The public officials of Vermont and many\r\nfrom New York were there. I heard President Harrison, who was the first\r\nPresident I had ever seen, make an address. As I looked on him and\r\nrealized that he personally represented the glory and dignity of the\r\nUnited States I wondered how it felt to bear so much responsibility and\r\nlittle thought I should ever know.\r\n\r\nThe fall of 1891 found me back at Amherst taking up my college course in\r\nearnest. Much of its social life centered around the fraternities, and\r\nalthough they did not leave me without an invitation to join them it was\r\nnot until senior year that an opportunity came to belong to one that I\r\nwished to accept. It has been my observation in life that, if one will\r\nonly exercise the patience to wait, his wants are likely to be filled.\r\n\r\nMy class was rather small, not numbering more than eighty-five in a\r\nstudent body of about four hundred. President Julius H. Seelye, who had\r\nled the college for about twenty years with great success as an educator\r\nand inspirer of young men, had just retired. He had been succeeded by\r\nPresident Merrill E. Gates, a man of brilliant intellect and fascinating\r\npersonality though not the equal of his predecessor in directing college\r\npolicy. But the faculty as a whole was excellent, having many strong\r\nmen, and some who were preeminent in the educational field.\r\n\r\nThe college of that day had a very laudable desire to get students, and\r\nhaving admitted them, it was equally alert in striving to keep them and\r\nhelp them get an education, with the result that very few left of their\r\nown volition and almost none were dropped for failure in their work.\r\nThere was no marked exodus at the first examination period, which was\r\ndue not only to the attitude of the college but to the attitude of the\r\nstudents, who did not go there because they wished to experiment for a\r\nfew months with college life and be able to say thereafter they had been\r\nin college, but went because they felt they had need of an education,\r\nand expected to work hard for that purpose until the course was\r\nfinished. There were few triflers.\r\n\r\nA small number became what we called sports, but they were not looked on\r\nwith favor, and they have not survived. While the class has lost many\r\nexcellent men besides, yet it seems to be true that unless men live\r\nright they die. Things are so ordered in this world that those who\r\nviolate its law cannot escape the penalty. Nature is inexorable. If men\r\ndo not follow the truth they cannot live.\r\n\r\nMy absence from home during my freshman year was more easy for me to\r\nbear because I was no longer leaving my father alone. Just before the\r\nopening of college he had married Miss Carrie A. Brown, who was one of\r\nthe finest women of our neighborhood. I had known her all my life. After\r\nbeing without a mother nearly seven years I was greatly pleased to find\r\nin her all the motherly devotion that she could have given me if I had\r\nbeen her own son. She was a graduate of Kimball Union Academy and had\r\ntaught school for some years. Loving books and music she was not only a\r\nmother to me but a teacher. For thirty years she watched over me and\r\nloved me, welcoming me when I went home, writing me often when I was\r\naway, and encouraging me in all my efforts. When at last she sank to\r\nrest she had seen me made Governor of Massachusetts and knew I was being\r\nconsidered for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though good influences had always been coming into my life.\r\nPerhaps I have been more fortunate in that respect than others. But\r\nwhile I am not disposed to minimize the amount of evil in the world I am\r\nconvinced that the good predominates and that it is constantly all about\r\nus, ready for our service if only we will accept it.\r\n\r\nIn the Amherst College of my day a freshman was not regarded as\r\ndifferent from the other classes. He wore no distinctive garb, or\r\nemblem, and suffered no special indignities. It would not have been\r\njudicious for him to appear on the campus with a silk hat and cane, but\r\nas none of the other students resorted to that practice this single\r\nrestriction was not a severe hardship. A cane rush always took place\r\nbetween the two lower classes very early in the fall term, but it was\r\nconfined within the limits of good-natured sport, where little damage\r\nwas done beyond a few torn clothes. If we had undertaken to have a class\r\nbanquet where the sophomores could reach us, it undoubtedly would have\r\nbrought on a collision, but when the time came for one we tactfully and\r\nsilently departed for Westfield, under cover of a winter evening, where\r\nwe were not found or molested.\r\n\r\nIt had long been the practice at Amherst to give careful attention to\r\nphysical culture. It had, I believe, the first college gymnasium in this\r\ncountry. Each student on entering was given a thorough examination,\r\nfurnished with a chart showing any bodily deficiencies and given\r\npersonal direction for their removal. The attendance of the whole class\r\nwas required at the gymnasium drill for four periods each week, and\r\nvoluntary work on the floor was always encouraged. We heard a great deal\r\nabout a sound mind in a sound body.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my entrance the two college dormitories were so badly out\r\nof repair that they were little used. Later they were completely\r\nremodeled and became fully occupied. About ten fraternity houses\r\nfurnished lodgings for most of the upper class men, but the lower class\r\nmen roomed at private houses. All the students took their meals in\r\nprivate houses, so that there was a general comingling of all classes\r\nand all fraternities around the table, which broke up exclusive circles\r\nand increased college democracy.\r\n\r\nThe places of general assembly were for religious worship, which\r\nconsisted of the chapel exercises at the first morning period each week\r\nday, and church service in the morning, with vespers in the late\r\nafternoon, on Sundays. Regular attendance at all of these was required.\r\nOf course we did not like to go and talked learnedly about the right of\r\nfreedom of worship, and the bad mental and moral reactions from which\r\nwe were likely to suffer as a result of being forced to hear scriptural\r\nreadings, psalm singings, prayers and sermons. We were told that our\r\nchoice of a college was optional, but that Amherst had been founded by\r\npious men with the chief object of training students to overcome the\r\nunbelief which was then thought to be prevalent, that religious\r\ninstruction was a part of the prescribed course, and that those who\r\nchose to remain would have to take it. If attendance on these religious\r\nservices ever harmed any of the men of my time I have never been\r\ninformed of it. The good it did I believe was infinite. Not the least of\r\nit was the discipline that resulted from having constantly to give some\r\nthought to things that young men would often prefer not to consider. If\r\nwe did not have the privilege of doing what we wanted to do, we had the\r\nmuch greater benefit of doing what we ought to do. It broke down our\r\nselfishness, it conquered our resistance, it supplanted impulse, and\r\nfinally it enthroned reason.\r\n\r\nIn intercollegiate athletics Amherst stood well. It won its share of\r\ntrophies on the diamond, the gridiron and the track, but it did not\r\nengage in any of the water sports. The games with Williams and\r\nDartmouth aroused the keenest interest, and honors were then about even.\r\nBut these outside activities were kept well within bounds and were not\r\npermitted to interfere with the real work of the college. Pratt Field\r\nhad just been completed and was well equipped for outdoor sports, while\r\nPratt Gymnasium had every facility for indoor training. These places\r\nwere well named, for the Pratt boys were very active in athletics. One\r\nof them was usually captain of the football team. I remember that in\r\n1892 George D. Pratt, afterwards Conservation Commissioner of the State\r\nof New York, led his team to victory against Dartmouth, thirty to two,\r\nand a week later kicked ten straight goals in a gale of wind at the\r\nchampionship game with Williams, leaving the score sixty to nothing in\r\nfavor of Amherst. But both these colleges have since retaliated with a\r\ngreat deal of success.\r\n\r\nIn these field events I was only an observer, contenting myself with\r\ngetting exercise by faithful attendance at the class drills in the\r\ngymnasium. In these the entire class worked together with dumbbells for\r\nmost of the time, but they involved sufficient marching about the floor\r\nto give a military flavor which I found very useful in later life when I\r\ncame in contact with military affairs during my public career.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential election of 1892 came in my sophomore year. I favored\r\nthe renomination of Harrison and joined the Republican Club of the\r\ncollege, which participated in a torch-light parade, but the\r\nunsatisfactory business condition of the country carried the victory to\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nFor nearly two years I continued my studies of Latin and Greek. Ours was\r\nthe last class that read Demosthenes on the Crown with Professor William\r\nS. Tyler, the head of the Greek department, who had been with the\r\ncollege about sixty years. He was a patriarch in appearance with a long\r\nbeard and flowing white hair.\r\n\r\nHis reverence for the ancient Greeks approached a religion. It was\r\nillustrated by a story, perhaps apocryphal, that one of his sons was\r\nsent to a theological school, and not wishing to engage in the ministry,\r\nwrote his father that the faculty of the school held that Socrates was\r\nin hell. Such a reflection on the Greek philosopher so outraged the old\r\nman’s loyalty that he wrote his son that the school was no place for him\r\nand directed him to come home at once.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his eighty-odd years he put the fire of youth into the\r\ntranslation of those glowing periods of the master orator, which were\r\nsuch eloquent appeals to the patriotism of the Greeks and such\r\ntremendous efforts to rouse them to the defense of their country. Those\r\npassages of the marvelous oration he said he had loved to read during\r\nthe Civil War.\r\n\r\nMy studies of the ancient languages I supplemented with short courses in\r\nFrench, German and Italian.\r\n\r\nBut I never became very proficient in the languages. I was more\r\nsuccessful at mathematics, which I pursued far enough to take calculus.\r\nThis course was mostly under George D. Olds, who came to teach when we\r\nentered to study, which later caused us to adopt him as an honorary\r\nmember of our class. In time he became President of the College. He had\r\na peculiar power to make figures interesting and knew how to hold the\r\nattention and affection of his students. It was under him that we\r\nlearned of the universal application of the laws of mathematics. We saw\r\nthe discoveries of Kepler, Descartes, Newton and their associates\r\nbringing the entire universe under one law, so that the most distant\r\npoint of light revealed by the largest reflector marches in harmony with\r\nour own planet. We discovered, too, that the same force that rounds a\r\ntear-drop holds all the myriad worlds of the universe in a balanced\r\nposition. We found that we dwelt in the midst of a Unity which was all\r\nsubject to the same rules of action. My education was making some\r\nheadway.\r\n\r\nIn the development of every boy who is going to amount to anything there\r\ncomes a time when he emerges from his immature ways and by the greater\r\nprecision of his thought and action realizes that he has begun to find\r\nhimself. Such a transition finally came to me. It was not accidental but\r\nthe result of hard work. If I had permitted my failures, or what seemed\r\nto me at the time a lack of success, to discourage me I cannot see any\r\nway in which I would ever have made progress. If we keep our faith in\r\nourselves, and what is even more important, keep our faith in regular\r\nand persistent application to hard work, we need not worry about the\r\noutcome.\r\n\r\nDuring my first two years at Amherst I studied hard but my marks were\r\nonly fair. It needed some encouragement from my father for me to\r\ncontinue. In junior year, however, my powers began to increase and my\r\nwork began to improve. My studies became more interesting. I found the\r\ncourse in history under Professor Anson D. Morse was very absorbing. His\r\nlectures on medieval and modern Europe were inspiring, seeking to give\r\nhis students not only the facts of past human experience but also their\r\nmeaning. He was very strong on the political side of history, bringing\r\nbefore us the great figures from Charlemagne to Napoleon with remarkable\r\ndistinctness, and showing us the influence of the Great Gregory and\r\nInnocent III. The work of Abélard and Erasmus was considered, and the\r\nimportant era of Luther and Calvin thoroughly explored.\r\n\r\nIn due time we crossed the Channel with William the Conqueror and\r\nlearned how he subdued and solidified the Kingdom of England. The\r\nsignificance of the long struggle with the Crown before the Parliament\r\nfinally reached a position of independence was disclosed, and the slow\r\ngrowth of a system of liberty under the law, until at last it was firmly\r\nestablished, was carefully explained. We saw the British Empire rise\r\nuntil it ruled the seas. The brilliance of the statesmanship of the\r\ndifferent periods, the rugged character of the patriotic leaders, of\r\nAnselm and Simon de Montfort, of Cromwell and the Puritans, who dared to\r\noppose the tyranny of the kings, the growth of learning, the development\r\nof commerce, the administration of justice--all these and more were\r\npresented for our consideration. Whatever was essential to a general\r\ncomprehension of European history we had.\r\n\r\nBut it was when he turned to the United States that Professor Morse\r\nbecame most impressive. He placed particular emphasis on the era when\r\nour institutions had their beginning. Washington was treated with the\r\ngreatest reverence, and a high estimate was placed on the statesmanlike\r\nqualities and financial capacity of Hamilton, but Jefferson was not\r\nneglected. In spite of his many vagaries it was shown that in saving\r\nthe nation from the danger of falling under the domination of an\r\noligarchy, and in establishing a firm rule of the people which was\r\nforever to remain, he vindicated the soundness of our political\r\ninstitutions. The whole course was a thesis on good citizenship and good\r\ngovernment. Those who took it came to a clearer comprehension not only\r\nof their rights and liberties but of their duties and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe department of public speaking was under Professor Henry A. Frink. He\r\nhad a strong hold on his students. His work went along with the other\r\nwork, practically through the four years, beginning with composition and\r\nrecitation and passing to the preparation and delivery of orations and\r\nparticipation in public debates. The allied subject of rhetoric I took\r\nunder Professor John F. Genung, a scholarly man who was held in high\r\nrespect. The courses in biology, chemistry, economics and geology I was\r\nnot able to pursue, though they all interested me and were taught by\r\nexcellent men.\r\n\r\nNot the least in the educational values of Amherst was its beautiful\r\nphysical surroundings. While the college buildings of the early\r\nnineties were not impressive, the town with its spacious common and fine\r\nelm trees was very attractive. It was located on the arch of a slight\r\nridge flanked on the north by Mount Warner and on the south by the\r\nHolyoke Range. The east rose over wooded slopes to the horizon, and the\r\nwest looked out across the meadows of the Connecticut to the spires of\r\nNorthampton and the Hampshire Hills beyond. Henry Ward Beecher has dwelt\r\nwith great admiration and affection on the beauties of this region,\r\nwhere he was a student. Each autumn, when the foliage had put on its\r\nrichest tints, the College set aside Mountain Day to be devoted to the\r\ncontemplation of the scenery so wonderfully displayed in forest, hill,\r\nand dale, before the frosts of winter laid them bare.\r\n\r\nIt always seemed to me that all our other studies were in the nature of\r\na preparation for the course in philosophy. The head of this department\r\nwas Charles E. Garman, who was one of the most remarkable men with whom\r\nI ever came in contact. He used numerous text books, which he furnished,\r\nand many pamphlets that he not only had written but had printed himself\r\non a hand press in his home. These he pledged us to show to no one\r\noutside the class, because, being fragmentary, and disclosing but one\r\nline of argument which might be entirely demolished in succeeding\r\nlessons, they might involve him in some needless controversy. It is\r\ndifficult to imagine his superior as an educator. Truly he drew men out.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the spring of junior year his course extended through four\r\nterms. The first part was devoted to psychology, in order to find out\r\nthe capacity and the limits of the human mind. It was here that we\r\nlearned the nature of habits and the great advantage of making them our\r\nallies instead of our enemies.\r\n\r\nMuch stress was placed on a thorough mastery and careful analysis of all\r\nthe arguments presented by the writers on any subject under\r\nconsideration. Then when it was certain that they were fully understood\r\nthey were criticized, so that what was unsound was rejected and what was\r\ntrue accepted. We were thoroughly drilled in the necessity of\r\ndistinguishing between the accidental and the essential. The proper\r\nmethod of presenting a subject and an argument was discussed. We were\r\nnot only learning about the human mind but learning how to use it,\r\nlearning how to think. A problem would often be stated and the class\r\nleft to attempt to find the solution unaided by the teacher. Above all\r\nwe were taught to follow the truth whithersoever it might lead. We were\r\nwarned that this would oftentimes be very difficult and result in much\r\nopposition, for there would be many who were not going that way, but if\r\nwe pressed on steadfastly it was sure to yield the peaceable fruits of\r\nthe mind. It does.\r\n\r\nOur investigation revealed that man is endowed with reason, that the\r\nhuman mind has the power to weigh evidence, to distinguish between right\r\nand wrong and to know the truth. I should call this the central theme of\r\nhis philosophy. While the quantity of the truth we know may be small it\r\nis the quality that is important. If we really know one truth the\r\nquality of our knowledge could not be surpassed by the Infinite.\r\n\r\nWe looked upon Garman as a man who walked with God. His course was a\r\ndemonstration of the existence of a personal God, of our power to know\r\nHim, of the Divine immanence, and of the complete dependence of all the\r\nuniverse on Him as the Creator and Father “in whom we live and move and\r\nhave our being.” Every reaction in the universe is a manifestation of\r\nHis presence. Man was revealed as His son, and nature as the hem of His\r\ngarment, while through a common Fatherhood we are all embraced in a\r\ncommon brotherhood. The spiritual appeal of music, sculpture, painting\r\nand all other art lies in the revelation it affords of the Divine\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions which followed from this position were logical and\r\ninescapable. It sets man off in a separate kingdom from all the other\r\ncreatures in the universe, and makes him a true son of God and a\r\npartaker of the Divine nature. This is the warrant for his freedom and\r\nthe demonstration of his equality. It does not assume all are equal in\r\ndegree but all are equal in kind. On that precept rests a foundation for\r\ndemocracy that cannot be shaken. It justifies faith in the people.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there are those who think they can demonstrate that this\r\nteaching was not correct. With\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nUnderwood & Underwood\r\n\r\nCALVIN COOLIDGE\r\n\r\n_At the age of three_]\r\n\r\nthem I have no argument. I know that in experience it has worked. In\r\ntime of crisis my belief that people can know the truth, that when it is\r\npresented to them they must accept it, has saved me from many of the\r\ncounsels of expediency. The spiritual nature of men has a power of its\r\nown that is manifest in every great emergency from Runnymede to Marston\r\nMoor, from the Declaration of Independence to the abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\nIn ethics he taught us that there is a standard of righteousness, that\r\nmight does not make right, that the end does not justify the means and\r\nthat expediency as a working principle is bound to fail. The only hope\r\nof perfecting human relationship is in accordance with the law of\r\nservice under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get\r\nas they are about what they shall give. Yet people are entitled to the\r\nrewards of their industry. What they earn is theirs, no matter how small\r\nor how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to\r\nuse it in a larger service. For a man not to recognize the truth, not to\r\nbe obedient to law, not to render allegiance to the State, is for him to\r\nbe at war with his own nature, to commit suicide. That is why “the\r\nwages of sin is death.” Unless we live rationally we perish, physically,\r\nmentally, spiritually.\r\n\r\nA great deal of emphasis was placed on the necessity and dignity of\r\nwork. Our talents are given us in order that we may serve ourselves and\r\nour fellow men. Work is the expression of intelligent action for a\r\nspecified end. It is not industry, but idleness, that is degrading. All\r\nkinds of work from the most menial service to the most exalted station\r\nare alike honorable. One of the earliest mandates laid on the human race\r\nwas to subdue the earth. That meant work.\r\n\r\nIf he was not in accord with some of the current teachings about\r\nreligion, he gave to his class a foundation for the firmest religious\r\nconvictions. He presented no mysteries or dogmas and never asked us to\r\ntake a theory on faith, but supported every position by facts and logic.\r\nHe believed in the Bible and constantly quoted it to illustrate his\r\nposition. He divested religion and science of any conflict with each\r\nother, and showed that each rested on the common basis of our ability to\r\nknow the truth.\r\n\r\nTo Garman was given a power which took his class up into a high\r\nmountain of spiritual life and left them alone with God.\r\n\r\nIn him was no pride of opinion, no atom of selfishness. He was a\r\nfollower of the truth, a disciple of the Cross, who bore the infirmities\r\nof us all. Those who finished his course in the last term of senior year\r\nfound in their graduating exercises a real commencement, when they would\r\nbegin their efforts to serve their fellow men in the practical affairs\r\nof life. Of course it was not possible for us to accept immediately the\r\nresults of his teachings or live altogether in accordance with them. I\r\ndo not think he expected it. He was constantly reminding us that the\r\nspirit was willing but the flesh was _strong_, but that nevertheless, if\r\nwe would continue steadfastly to think on these things we would be\r\nchanged from glory to glory through increasing intellectual and moral\r\npower. He was right.\r\n\r\nTo many my report of his course will seem incomplete and crude. I am not\r\nwriting a treatise but trying to tell what I secured from his teaching,\r\nand relating what has seemed important in it to me, from the memory I\r\nhave retained of it, since I began it thirty-five years ago. He\r\nexpected it to be supplemented. He was fond of referring to it as a\r\nmansion not made with hands, incomplete, but sufficient for our\r\nspiritual habitation. What he revealed to us of the nature of God and\r\nman will stand. Against it “the gates of hell shall not prevail.”\r\n\r\nAs I look back upon the college I am more and more impressed with the\r\nstrength of its faculty, with their power for good. Perhaps it has men\r\nnow with a broader preliminary training, though they then were profound\r\nscholars, perhaps it has men of keener intellects though they then were\r\nvery exact in their reasoning, but the great distinguishing mark of all\r\nof them was that they were men of character. Their words carried\r\nconviction because we were compelled to believe in the men who uttered\r\nthem. They had the power not merely to advise but literally to instruct\r\ntheir students.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with custom our class chose three of its members by\r\npopular vote to speak at the commencement. To me was assigned the grove\r\noration, which according to immemorial practice deals with the record of\r\nthe class in a witty and humorous way. While my effort was not without\r\nsome success I very soon learned that making fun of people in a public\r\nway was not a good method to secure friends, or likely to lead to much\r\nadvancement, and I have scrupulously avoided it.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of my course my scholarship had improved, so that I\r\nwas graduated _cum laude_.\r\n\r\nAfter my course was done I went home to do a summer’s work on the farm,\r\nwhich was to be my last. I had decided to enter the law and expected to\r\nattend a law school, but one of my classmates wrote me late in the\r\nsummer that there was an opportunity to go into the office of Hammond\r\nand Field at Northampton, so I applied to them and was accepted. After I\r\nhad been there a few days a most courteous letter came from the\r\nHonorable William P. Dillingham requesting me to call on him at\r\nMontpelier and indicating he would take me into his office. He recalled\r\nthe circumstance when I found him in the Senate after I became Vice\r\nPresident. But I had already reverted to Massachusetts, where my family\r\nhad lived for one hundred and fifty years before their advent into\r\nVermont. Had his letter reached me sooner probably it would have\r\nchanged the whole course of my life.\r\n\r\nNorthampton was the county seat and a quiet but substantial town, with\r\npleasant surroundings and fine old traditions reaching back beyond\r\nJonathan Edwards. It was just recovering from the depression of 1893,\r\npreparing to eliminate its grade crossings and starting some new\r\nindustries that would add to the business it secured from Smith College,\r\nwhich was a growing institution with many hundreds of students.\r\n\r\nThe senior member of the law firm was John C. Hammond, who was\r\nconsidered the leader of the Hampshire Bar. He was a lawyer of great\r\nlearning and wide business experience, with a remarkable ability in the\r\npreparation of pleadings and an insight that soon brought him to the\r\ncrucial point of a case. He was massive and strong rather than elegant,\r\nand placed great stress on accuracy. He presented a cause in court with\r\nability and skill. The junior member was Henry P. Field, an able lawyer\r\nand a man of engaging personality and polish, who I found was an\r\nAlderman. That appeared to me at the time to be close to the Almighty\r\nin importance. I shall always remember with a great deal of gratitude\r\nthe kindness of these two men to me.\r\n\r\nThat I was now engaged in the serious enterprise of life I so fully\r\nrealized that I went to the barber shop and divested myself of the\r\ncollege fashion of long hair. Office hours were from eight to about six\r\no’clock, during which I spent my time in reading Kent’s Commentaries and\r\nin helping prepare writs, deeds, wills, and other documents. My evenings\r\nI gave to some of the masters of English composition. I read the\r\nspeeches of Lord Erskine, of Webster, and Choate. The essays of Macaulay\r\ninterested me much, and the writings of Carlyle and John Fiske I found\r\nvery stimulating. Some of the orations of Cicero I translated, being\r\nespecially attached to the defense of his friend the poet Archias,\r\nbecause in it he dwelt on the value and consolation of good literature.\r\nI read much in Milton and Shakespeare and found delight in the shorter\r\npoems of Kipling, Field and Riley.\r\n\r\nMy first Christmas was made more merry by getting notice that the Sons\r\nof the American Revolution had awarded me the prize of a gold medal\r\nworth about one hundred and fifty dollars for writing the best essay on\r\n“The Principles Fought for in the American Revolution,” in a competition\r\nopen to the seniors of all the colleges of the nation. The notice came\r\none day, and it was announced in the next morning papers, where Judge\r\nField saw it before I had a chance to tell him. So when he came to the\r\noffice he asked me about it. I had not had time to send the news home.\r\nAnd then I had a little vanity in wishing my father to learn of it first\r\nfrom the press, which he did. He had questioned some whether I was\r\nreally making anything of my education, in pretense I now think, not\r\nbecause he doubted it but because he wished to impress me with the\r\ndesirability of demonstrating it.\r\n\r\nBut my main effort in those days was to learn the law. The Superior\r\nCourt had three civil and two criminal terms each year in Northampton.\r\nWhenever it was sitting I spent all my time in the court room. In this\r\nway I became familiar with the practical side of trial work. I soon came\r\nto see that the counsel who knew the law were the ones who held the\r\nattention of the Judge, took the jury with them, and won their cases.\r\nThey were prepared. The office where I was had a very large general\r\npractice which covered every field and took them into all the Courts of\r\nthe Commonwealth but little into the Federal Courts. I assisted in the\r\npreparation of cases and went to court with the members of the firm to\r\nwatch all their trial work and help keep a record of testimony for use\r\nin the arguments. It was all a work of absorbing interest to me.\r\n\r\nThe books in the office soon appeared too ponderous for my study, so I\r\nbought a supply of students’ text books and law cases on the principal\r\nsubjects necessary for my preparation for the bar. These enabled me to\r\ngain a more rapid acquaintance with the main legal principles, because I\r\ndid not have to read through so much unimportant detail as was contained\r\nin the usual treatise prepared for a lawyer’s library, which was usually\r\na collection of all the authorities, while what I wanted was the main\r\nelements of the law. I was soon conversant with contracts, torts,\r\nevidence, and real property, with some knowledge of Massachusetts\r\npleading, and had a considerable acquaintance with the practical side\r\nof statute law.\r\n\r\nI do not feel that any one ever really masters the law, but it is not\r\ndifficult to master the approaches to the law, so that given a certain\r\nstate of facts it is possible to know how to marshal practically all the\r\nlegal decisions which apply to them. I think counsel are mistaken in the\r\nfacts of their case about as often as they are mistaken in the law.\r\n\r\nAll my waking hours were so fully employed that I found little time for\r\nplay. My college was but eight miles distant, yet I did not have any\r\ndesire to go back to the intercollegiate games, though I was accustomed\r\nto attend the alumni dinner at commencement. There was a canoe club\r\nwhich I joined, on the Connecticut, about a mile over the meadow from\r\nthe town where I often went on Sunday afternoons. I was full of the joy\r\nof doing something in the world. Another reason why I discarded all\r\noutside enterprises and kept strictly to my work and my books was\r\nbecause I was keeping my monthly expenditures within thirty dollars\r\nwhich was furnished me by my father. He would gladly have provided me\r\nmore had I needed it, but I thought that was enough and was determined\r\nto live within it, which I did. Not much was left for any unnecessary\r\npleasantries of life.\r\n\r\nSoon after I entered the office Mr. Hammond was elected District\r\nAttorney and Mr. Field became Mayor of the city, so that I saw something\r\nof the working of the city government and the administration of the\r\ncriminal law.\r\n\r\nThe first summer I was in Northampton came the famous free silver\r\ncampaign of 1896. When Mr. Bryan was nominated he had the support of\r\nmost of the local Democrats of the city, but he lost much of it before\r\nNovember. One of them sent a long communication to a county paper\r\nindorsing him. This I answered in one of the city papers. When I was\r\nhome that summer I took part in a small neighborhood debate in which I\r\nsupported the gold standard. The study I put on this subject well repaid\r\nme. Of course Northampton went handsomely for McKinley.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a week or two at home in the summer of 1896 I kept\r\non in this way with my work from September, 1895, to June, 1897. I then\r\nfelt sufficiently versed in the law to warrant my taking the examination\r\nfor admission to the Bar. It was conducted by a County Committee of\r\nwhich Mr. Hammond was a member, but as I was his student he left the\r\nother two, Judge William G. Bassett and Judge William P. Strickland, to\r\nact on my petition. I was pronounced qualified by them and just before\r\nJuly 4, 1897, I was duly admitted to practice before the Courts of\r\nMassachusetts. My preparation had taken about twenty months. Only after\r\nI was finally in possession of my certificate did I notify my father. He\r\nhad expected that my studies would take another year, and I wanted to\r\nsurprise him if I succeeded and not disappoint him if I failed. I did\r\nnot fail. I was just twenty-five years old and very happy.\r\n\r\nIt was a little over eleven years from the time I left home for the\r\nAcademy in the late winter of 1886 until I was admitted to the Bar in\r\nthe early summer of 1897. They had been years full of experience for me,\r\nin which I had advanced from a child to a man. Wherever I went I found\r\ngood people, men and women, and young folks of my own age, who had won\r\nmy respect and affection. From the hearthstone of my father’s fireside\r\nto the court room at Northampton they had all been kind and helpful to\r\nme. Their memory will always be one of my most cherished possessions.\r\n\r\nMy formal period of education was passed, though my studies are still\r\npursued. I was devoted to the law, its reasonableness appealed to my\r\nmind as the best method of securing justice between man and man. I fully\r\nexpected to become the kind of country lawyer I saw all about me,\r\nspending my life in the profession, with perhaps a final place on the\r\nBench. But it was decreed to be otherwise. Some Power that I little\r\nsuspected in my student days took me in charge and carried me on from\r\nthe obscure neighborhood at Plymouth Notch to the occupancy of the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW AND POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\nTHE LAW AND POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to know how to get admitted to the Bar but quite another\r\nthing to know how to practice law. Those who attend a law school know\r\nhow to pass the examinations, while those who study in an office know\r\nhow to apply their knowledge to actual practice. It seems to me that the\r\nbest course is to go to a school and then go into an office where the\r\npractice is general. In that way the best preparation is secured for a\r\nthorough comprehension of the great basic principles of the profession\r\nand for their application to existing facts. Still, one who has had a\r\ngood college training can do very well by starting in an office. But in\r\nany case he should not go into the law because it appears to be merely a\r\nmeans of making a living, but because he has a real and sincere love for\r\nthe profession, which will enable him to make the sacrifices it\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nWhen I decided to enter the law it was only natural, therefore, that I\r\nshould consider it the highest of the professions. If I had not held\r\nthat opinion it would have been a measure of intellectual dishonesty for\r\nme to take it for a life work. Others may be hampered by circumstances\r\nin making their choice, but I was free, and I went where I felt the\r\nduties would be congenial and the opportunities for service large. Those\r\nwho follow other vocations ought to feel the same about them, and I hope\r\nthey do.\r\n\r\nMy opinion had been formed by the high estimation in which the Bench and\r\nBar were held by the people in my boyhood home in Vermont. It was\r\nconfirmed by my more intimate intercourse with the members of the\r\nprofession with whom I soon came in contact in Massachusetts after I\r\nwent there to study law in the autumn of 1895. When I was admitted to\r\npractice two years later the law still occupied the high position of a\r\nprofession. It had not then assumed any of its later aspects of a trade.\r\n\r\nThe ethics of the Northampton Bar were high. It was made up of men who\r\nhad, and were entitled to have, the confidence and respect of their\r\nneighbors who knew them best. They put the interests of their clients\r\nabove their own, and the public interests above them both. They were\r\ncourteous and tolerant toward each other and respectful to the Court.\r\nThis attitude was fostered by the appreciation of the uprightness and\r\nlearning of the Judges.\r\n\r\nBecause of the short time I had spent in preparation I remained in the\r\noffice of Hammond and Field about seven months after I was admitted to\r\nthe Bar. I was looking about for a place to locate but found none that\r\nseemed better than Northampton. A new block called the Masonic Building\r\nwas under construction on lower Main Street, and when it was ready for\r\noccupancy I opened an office there February 1, 1898. I had two rooms,\r\nwhere I was to continue to practice law for twenty-one years, until I\r\nbecame Governor of Massachusetts in 1919. For my office furniture and a\r\ngood working library I paid about $800 from some money I had saved and\r\ninherited from my grandfather Moor. My rent was $200 per year. I began\r\nto be self-sustaining except as to the cost of my table board, which was\r\npaid by my father until September, but thereafter all my expenses I\r\npaid from the fees I received.\r\n\r\nI was alone. While I had many acquaintances that I might call friends I\r\nhad no influential supporters who were desirous to see me advanced and\r\nwere sending business to me. I was dependent on the general public; what\r\nI had, came from them. My earnings for the first year were a little over\r\n$500.\r\n\r\nMy interest in public affairs had already caused me to become a member\r\nof the Republican City Committee, and in December, 1898, I was elected\r\none of the three members of the Common Council from Ward Two. The office\r\nwas without salary and not important, but the contacts were helpful.\r\nWhen the local military company returned that summer from the Cuban\r\nCampaign I did my best to get an armory built for them. I was not\r\nsuccessful at that time but my proposal was adopted a little later. This\r\nwas the beginning of an interest in military preparation which I have\r\nnever relinquished.\r\n\r\nDuring 1899 I began to get more business. The Nonotuck Savings Bank was\r\nstarted early that year, and I became its counsel. Its growth was slow\r\nbut steady. In later years I was its President, a purely honorary place\r\nwithout salary but no small honor. There was legal work about the county\r\nwhich came to my office, so that my fees rose to $1,400 for the second\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nI did not seek reelection to the City Council, as I knew the City\r\nSolicitor was to retire and I wanted that place. The salary was $600,\r\nwhich was not unimportant to me. But my whole thought was on my\r\nprofession. I wanted to be City Solicitor because I believed it would\r\nmake me a better lawyer. I was elected and held the office until March,\r\n1902. It gave me a start in the law which I was ever after able to hold.\r\n\r\nThe office was not burdensome and went along with my private practice.\r\nIt took me into Court some. In a jury trial I lost two trifling cases in\r\nan action of damages against the city for taking a small strip of land\r\nto widen a highway. I felt I should have won these cases on the claim\r\nthat the land in question already belonged to the highway. But I\r\nprevailed in an unimportant case in the Supreme Court against my old\r\npreceptor Mr. Hammond. It is unnecessary to say that usually my cases\r\nwith him were decided in his favor. The training in this office gave me\r\na good grasp of municipal law, that later brought some important cases\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the mortgage and title work of the Savings Bank, I\r\nmanaged some real estate, and had considerable practice in the\r\nsettlement of estates. Through a collection business I also had some\r\ninsolvency practice. I recall an estate in Amherst and one in\r\nBelchertown, both much involved in litigation, which I settled. In each\r\ncase Stephen S. Taft of Springfield was the opposing counsel. Perhaps\r\nthere is no such thing as a best lawyer, any more than there is a best\r\nbook, or a best picture, but to me Mr. Taft was the best lawyer I ever\r\nsaw. If he was trying a case before a jury he was always the thirteenth\r\njuryman, and if the trial was before the court he was always advising\r\nthe Judge. But he did not win these cases. He became one of my best\r\nfriends, and we were on the same side in several cases in later years.\r\nOne time he said to me: “Young man, when you can settle a case within\r\nreason you settle it. You will not make so large a fee out of some one\r\ncase in that way, but at the end of the year you will have more money\r\nand your clients will be much better satisfied.” This was sound advice\r\nand I heeded it. People began to feel that they could consult me with\r\nsome safety and without the danger of being involved needlessly in long\r\nand costly litigation in court. Very few of my clients ever had to pay a\r\nbill of costs. I suppose they were more reasonable than other clients,\r\nfor they usually settled their differences out of court. This course did\r\nnot give me much experience in the trial of cases, so I never became\r\nvery proficient in that art, but it brought me a very satisfactory\r\npractice and a fair income.\r\n\r\nI worked hard during this early period. The matters on which I was\r\nengaged were numerous but did not involve large amounts of money and the\r\nfees were small. For three years I did not take the time to visit my old\r\nhome in Vermont, but when I did go I was City Solicitor. My father began\r\nto see his hopes realized and felt that his efforts to give me an\r\neducation were beginning to be rewarded.\r\n\r\nWhat I always felt was the greatest compliment ever paid to my\r\nprofessional ability came in 1903. In the late spring of that year\r\nWilliam H. Clapp, who had been for many years the Clerk of the Courts\r\nfor Hampshire County died. His ability, learning and painstaking\r\nindustry made him rank very high as a lawyer. The position he held was\r\nof the first importance, for it involved keeping all the civil and\r\ncriminal records of the Superior Court and the Supreme Judicial Court\r\nfor the County. The Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court appointed me\r\nto fill the vacancy. I always felt this was a judgment by the highest\r\nCourt in the Commonwealth on my professional qualifications. Had I been\r\nwilling to accept the place permanently I should have been elected to it\r\nin the following November. The salary was then $2,300, and the position\r\nwas one of great dignity, but I preferred to remain at the Bar, which\r\nmight be more precarious, but also had more possibilities. Later events\r\nnow known enable any one to pass judgment on my decision. Had I decided\r\notherwise I could have had much more peace of mind in the last\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\nAs the Clerk of the Courts I learned much relating to Massachusetts\r\npractice, so that ever after I\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     Underwood & Underwood\r\n\r\nCALVIN COOLIDGE\r\n\r\n_At the age of seven_]\r\n\r\nknew what to do with all the documents in a trial, which would have been\r\nof much value to me if I had not been called on to give so much time to\r\npolitical affairs. These took up a large amount of my attention in 1904\r\nafter I went back to my office, so that my income diminished during that\r\nyear. I had been chosen Chairman of the Republican City Committee. It\r\nwas a time of perpetual motion in Massachusetts politics. The state\r\nelections came yearly in November, and the city elections followed in\r\nDecember. This was presidential year. While I elected the\r\nRepresentatives to the General Court by a comfortable margin at the\r\nstate election I was not so successful in the city campaign. Our Mayor\r\nhad served three terms, which had always been the extreme limit in\r\nNorthampton, but he was nominated for a fourth time. He was defeated by\r\nabout eighty votes. We made the mistake of talking too much about the\r\ndeficiencies of our opponents and not enough about the merits of our own\r\ncandidates. I have never again fallen into that error. Feeling one year\r\nwas all I could give to the chairmanship I did not accept a reelection\r\nbut still remained on the committee.\r\n\r\nMy earnings had been such that I was able to make some small savings. My\r\nprospects appeared to be good. I had many friends and few enemies. There\r\nwas a little more time for me to give to the amenities of life. I took\r\nmy meals at Rahar’s Inn where there was much agreeable company\r\nconsisting of professional and business men of the town and some of the\r\nprofessors of Smith College. I had my rooms on Round Hill with the\r\nsteward of the Clarke School for the Deaf. While these relations were\r\nmost agreeable and entertaining I suppose I began to want a home of my\r\nown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter she had finished her course at the University of Vermont Miss\r\nGrace Goodhue went to the Clarke School to take the training to enable\r\nher to teach the deaf. When she had been there a year or so I met her\r\nand often took her to places of entertainment.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 Northampton celebrated its two hundred and fiftieth anniversary.\r\nOne evening was devoted to a reception for the Governor and his Council,\r\ngiven by the Daughters of the American Revolution. Miss Goodhue\r\naccompanied me to the City Hall where the reception was held, and after\r\nstrolling around for a time we sat down in two comfortable vacant\r\nchairs. Soon a charming lady approached us and said that those chairs\r\nwere reserved for the Governor and Mrs. Bates and that we should have to\r\nrelinquish them, which we did. Fourteen years later when we had received\r\nsufficient of the election returns to show that I had been chosen\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts I turned to her and said, “The Daughters of\r\nthe American Revolution cannot put us out of the Governor’s chair now.”\r\n\r\nFrom our being together we seemed naturally to come to care for each\r\nother. We became engaged in the early summer of 1905 and were married at\r\nher home in Burlington, Vermont, on October fourth of that year. I have\r\nseen so much fiction written on this subject that I may be pardoned for\r\nrelating the plain facts. We thought we were made for each other. For\r\nalmost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities, and I\r\nhave rejoiced in her graces.\r\n\r\nAfter our return from a trip to Montreal we staid a short time at the\r\nNorwood Hotel but soon started housekeeping. We rented a very\r\ncomfortable house that needed but one maid to help Mrs. Coolidge do her\r\nwork. Of course my expenses increased, and I had to plan very carefully\r\nfor a time to live within my income. I know very well what it means to\r\nawake in the night and realize that the rent is coming due, wondering\r\nwhere the money is coming from with which to pay it. The only way I know\r\nof escape from that constant tragedy is to keep running expenses low\r\nenough so that something may be saved to meet the day when earnings may\r\nbe small.\r\n\r\nWhen the city election was approaching in December I was asked to be a\r\ncandidate for School Committee. It was a purely honorary office, which\r\nhad no attraction for me, but I consented and was nominated. To my\r\nsurprise another Republican took out nomination papers, which split the\r\nparty and elected a Democrat. The open compliment was that I had no\r\nchildren in the schools, but the real reason was that I was a\r\npolitician. That reputation I had acquired by long service on the party\r\ncommittee helping elect our candidates. The man they elected gave a\r\nuseful service for several years and left me free to turn to avenues\r\nwhich were to be much more useful to me in ways for public service. I\r\nwas also better off attending to my law practice and my new home.\r\n\r\nThe days passed quietly with us until the next autumn, when we moved\r\ninto the house in Massasoit Street that was to be our home for so long.\r\nI attended to the furnishing of it myself, and when it was ready Mrs.\r\nCoolidge and I walked over to it. In about two weeks our first boy came\r\non the evening of September seventh. The fragrance of the clematis which\r\ncovered the bay window filled the room like a benediction, where the\r\nmother lay with her baby. We called him John in honor of my father. It\r\nwas all very wonderful to us.\r\n\r\nWe liked the house where our children came to us and the neighbors who\r\nwere so kind. When we could have had a more pretentious home we still\r\nclung to it. So long as I lived there, I could be independent and serve\r\nthe public without ever thinking that I could not maintain my position\r\nif I lost my office. I always made my living practicing law up to the\r\ntime I became Governor, without being dependent on any official salary.\r\nThis left me free to make my own decisions in accordance with what I\r\nthought was the public good. We lived where we did that I might better\r\nserve the people.\r\n\r\nMy main thought in those days was to improve myself in my profession. I\r\nwas still studying law and literature. Because I thought the experience\r\nwould contribute to this end I became a candidate for the Massachusetts\r\nHouse of Representatives. In a campaign in which I secured a large\r\nnumber of Democratic votes, many of which never thereafter deserted me,\r\nI was elected by a margin of about two hundred and sixty.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker assigned me to the Committees on Constitutional Amendments\r\nand Mercantile Affairs. During the session I helped draft, and the\r\nCommittee reported, a bill to prevent large concerns from selling at a\r\nlower price in one locality than they did in others, for the purpose of\r\ninjuring their competitor. This seemed to me an unfair trade practice\r\nthat should be abolished. We secured the passage of the bill in the\r\nHouse, but the Senate rewrote it in such a way that it finally failed.\r\nI also supported a resolution favoring the direct election of United\r\nStates Senators and another providing for woman suffrage. These measures\r\ndid not have the approbation of the conservative element of my party,\r\nbut I had all the assurance of youth and ignorance in supporting them,\r\nand later I saw them all become the law.\r\n\r\nThe next year I was reelected, but in running against a man who had a\r\nstrong hold on some of the Republican Wards, my vote was cut down.\r\nServing on the Judiciary Committee, which I wanted because I felt it\r\nwould assist me in my profession, I became much interested in modifying\r\nthe law so that an injunction could not be issued in a labor dispute to\r\nprevent one person seeking by argument to induce another to leave his\r\nemployer. This bill failed. While I think it had merit, in later years I\r\ncame to see that what was of real importance to the wage earners was not\r\nhow they might conduct a quarrel with their employers, but how the\r\nbusiness of the country might be so organized as to insure steady\r\nemployment at a fair rate of pay. If that were done there would be no\r\noccasion for a quarrel, and if it were not done a quarrel would do no\r\none any good.\r\n\r\nThe work in the General Court was fascinating, both from its nature and\r\nfrom the companionship with able and interesting men, but it took five\r\ndays each week for nearly six months, so that I thought I had secured\r\nabout all the benefit I could by serving two terms and declined again to\r\nbe a candidate. Another boy had been given into our keeping April 13 who\r\nwas named Calvin, so I had all the more reason for staying at home.\r\n\r\nMy law office took all my attention. I never had a retainer from any\r\none, so my income always seemed precarious, but a practice which was\r\ngeneral in its nature kept coming to me. In June of 1909 I went to\r\nPhoenix, Arizona, to hold a corporation meeting. It was the first I had\r\nseen of the West. The great possibilities of the region were apparent,\r\nand the enthusiasm of the people was inspiring. It told me that our\r\ncountry was sure to be a success.\r\n\r\nFor two years Northampton had elected a Democrat to be Mayor. He was a\r\nvery substantial business man, who has since been my landlord for a\r\nlong period. He was to retire, and the Republicans were anxious to\r\nelect his successor. At a party conference it was determined to ask me\r\nto run and I accepted the opportunity, thinking the honor would be one\r\nthat would please my father, advance me in my profession, and enable me\r\nto be of some public service. It was a local office, not requiring\r\nenough time to interfere seriously with my own work.\r\n\r\nWithout in any way being conscious of what I was doing I then became\r\ncommitted to a course that was to make me the President of the Senate of\r\nMassachusetts and of the Senate of the United States, the second officer\r\nof the Commonwealth and the country, and the chief executive of a city,\r\na state and a nation. I did not plan for it but it came. I tried to\r\ntreat people as they treated me, which was much better than my deserts,\r\nin accordance with the precept of the master poet. By my studies and my\r\ncourse of life I meant to be ready to take advantage of opportunities. I\r\nwas ready, from the time the Justices named me the Clerk of the Courts\r\nuntil my party nominated me for President.\r\n\r\nEver since I was in Amherst College I have remembered how Garman told\r\nhis class in philosophy that if they would go along with events and have\r\nthe courage and industry to hold to the main stream, without being\r\nwashed ashore by the immaterial cross currents, they would some day be\r\nmen of power. He meant that we should try to guide ourselves by general\r\nprinciples and not get lost in particulars. That may sound like\r\nmysticism, but it is only the mysticism that envelopes every great\r\ntruth. One of the greatest mysteries in the world is the success that\r\nlies in conscientious work.\r\n\r\nMy first campaign for Mayor was very intense. My opponent was a popular\r\nmerchant, a personal friend of mine who years later was to be Mayor, so\r\nthat at the outset he was the favorite. The only issue was our general\r\nqualifications to conduct the business of the city. I called on many of\r\nthe voters personally, sent out many letters, spoke at many ward rallies\r\nand kept my poise. In the end most of my old Democratic friends voted\r\nfor me, and I won by about one hundred and sixty-five votes.\r\n\r\nOn the first Monday of January, 1910, I began a public career that was\r\nto continue until the first Monday of March, 1929, when it was to end\r\nby my own volition.\r\n\r\nOur city had always been fairly well governed and had no great problems.\r\nTaxes had been increasing. I was able to reduce them some and pay part\r\nof the debt, so that I left the net obligations chargeable to taxes at\r\nabout $100,000. The salaries of teachers were increased. My work\r\ncommended itself to the people, so that running against the same\r\nopponent for reelection my majority was much increased. I celebrated\r\nthis event by taking my family to Montpelier where my father was serving\r\nin the Vermont Senate. Of all the honors that have come to me I still\r\ncherish in a very high place the confidence of my friends and neighbors\r\nin making me their Mayor.\r\n\r\nRemaining in one office long did not appeal to me, for I was not seeking\r\na public career. My heart was in the law. I thought a couple of terms in\r\nthe Massachusetts Senate would be helpful to me, so when our Senator\r\nretired I sought his place in the fall of 1911 and was elected.\r\n\r\nThe winter in Boston I did not find very satisfactory. I was lonesome.\r\nMy old friends in the House were gone. The Western Massachusetts Club\r\nthat had its headquarters at the Adams House, where most of us lived\r\nthat came from beyond the Connecticut, was inactive. The Committees I\r\nhad, except the Chairmanship of Agriculture, did not interest me\r\ngreatly, and to crown my discontent a Democratic Governor sent in a\r\nveto, which the Senate sustained, to a bill authorizing the New Haven\r\nRailroad to construct a trolley system in Western Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBut as chairman of a special committee I had helped settle the Lawrence\r\nstrike, secured the appointment of a commission that resulted in the\r\npassage of a mothers’ aid or maternity bill at the next session, and I\r\nwas made chairman of a recess committee to secure better transportation\r\nfor rural communities in the western part of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer we did a large amount of work on that committee and\r\nmade a very full and constructive report at the opening of the General\r\nCourt in 1913. This was the period that the Republican party was divided\r\nbetween Taft and Roosevelt, so that Massachusetts easily went for\r\nWilson. But in the three-cornered contest I was reelected to the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nIt was in my second term in the Senate that I began to be a force in the\r\nMassachusetts Legislature. President Greenwood made me chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Railroads, which I very much wanted, because of my desire\r\nbetter to understand business affairs, and also put me on the important\r\nCommittee on Rules. I made progress because I studied subjects\r\nsufficiently to know a little more about them than any one else on the\r\nfloor. I did not often speak but talked much with the Senators\r\npersonally and came in contact with many of the business men of the\r\nstate. The Boston Democrats came to be my friends and were a great help\r\nto me in later times.\r\n\r\nMy committee reported a bill transforming the Railroad Commission into a\r\nPublic Service Commission, with a provision intending to define and\r\nlimit the borrowing powers of railroads which we passed after a long\r\nstruggle and debate. The Democratic Governor vetoed the bill, but it was\r\npassed over his veto almost unanimously. The bill came out for our\r\ntrolley roads in Western Massachusetts and was adopted. He vetoed this,\r\nand his veto was overridden by a large majority. It was altogether the\r\nmost enjoyable session I ever spent with any legislative body.\r\n\r\nIt had been my intention to retire at the end of my second term, but the\r\nPresident of the Senate was reported as being a candidate for\r\nLieutenant-Governor, and as it seemed that I could succeed him I\r\nannounced that I wished for another election. When it was too late for\r\nme to withdraw gracefully President Greenwood decided to remain in the\r\nSenate. I wanted to be President of the Senate, because it was a chance\r\nto emerge from being a purely local figure to a place of state-wide\r\ndistinction and authority. I knew where the votes in the Senate lay from\r\nthe hard legislative contests I had conducted, and I had them fairly\r\nwell organized when I found the President was not to retire.\r\n\r\nIn this year of 1913 the division in the Republican party in\r\nMassachusetts was most pronounced. Our candidate for Governor fell to\r\nthird place at the election, and another Democrat was made chief\r\nexecutive, carrying with him for the first time in a generation the\r\nwhole state ticket. But my district returned me. When I reached my\r\noffice the next morning I found President Greenwood had been defeated.\r\nAgain I was ready. By three o’clock that Wednesday afternoon I was in\r\nBoston, and by Monday I had enough written pledges from the Republican\r\nSenators to insure my nomination for President of the Senate at the\r\nparty caucus. It had been a real contest, but all opposition subsided\r\nand I was unanimously nominated.\r\n\r\nThe Senate showed the effects of the division in our party. It had\r\ntwenty-one Republicans, seventeen Democrats and two Progressives. When\r\nthe vote was cast for President on the opening day of the General Court,\r\nSenator Cox the Progressive had two votes, Senator Horgan the Democrat\r\nhad seven votes, and I had thirty-one votes. I had not only become an\r\nofficer of the whole Commonwealth, but I had come into possession of an\r\ninfluence reaching beyond the confines of my own party which I was to\r\nretain so long as I remained in public life.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had arrived at the important position of President of the\r\nMassachusetts Senate in January of 1914, I had not been transported on\r\na bed of roses. It was the result of many hard struggles in which I had\r\nmade many mistakes, was to keep on making them up to the present hour,\r\nand expect to continue to make them as long as I live. We are all\r\nfallible, but experience ought to teach us not to repeat our errors.\r\n\r\nMy progress had been slow and toilsome, with little about it that was\r\nbrilliant, or spectacular, the result of persistent and painstaking\r\nwork, which gave it a foundation that was solid. I trust that in making\r\nthis record of my own thoughts and feeling in relation to it, which\r\nnecessarily bristles with the first personal pronoun, I shall not seem\r\nto be overestimating myself, but simply relating experiences which I\r\nhope may prove to be an encouragement to others in their struggles to\r\nimprove their place in the world.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me in January, 1914, that a spirit of radicalism\r\nprevailed which unless checked was likely to prove very destructive. It\r\nhad been encouraged by the opposition and by a large faction of my own\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of the claim in general that in some way the government was\r\nto be blamed because everybody was not prosperous, because it was\r\nnecessary to work for a living, and because our written constitutions,\r\nthe legislatures, and the courts protected the rights of private owners\r\nespecially in relation to large aggregations of property.\r\n\r\nThe previous session had been overwhelmed with a record number of bills\r\nintroduced, many of them in an attempt to help the employee by impairing\r\nthe property of the employer. Though anxious to improve the condition of\r\nour wage earners, I believed this doctrine would soon destroy business\r\nand deprive them of a livelihood. What was needed was a restoration of\r\nconfidence in our institutions and in each other, on which economic\r\nprogress might rest.\r\n\r\nIn taking the chair as President of the Senate I therefore made a short\r\naddress, which I had carefully prepared, appealing to the conservative\r\nspirit of the people. I argued that the government could not relieve us\r\nfrom toil, that large concerns are necessary for the progress in which\r\ncapital and labor all have a common interest, and I defended\r\nrepresentative government and the integrity of the courts. The address\r\nhas since been known as “Have Faith in Massachusetts.” Many people in\r\nthe Commonwealth had been waiting for such a word, and the effect was\r\nbeyond my expectation. Confusion of thought began to disappear, and\r\nunsound legislative proposals to diminish.\r\n\r\nThe office of President of the Senate is one of great dignity and power.\r\nAll the committees of the Senate are appointed by him. He has the chief\r\nplace in directing legislation when the Governor is of the opposite\r\nparty, as was the case in 1914. At the inauguration he presides over the\r\njoint convention of the General Court and administers the oaths of\r\noffice to the Governor and Council in accordance with a formal ritual\r\nthat has come from colonial days, and is much more ceremonious than the\r\nswearing-in of a President at Washington.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem to me desirable to pursue a course of partisan\r\nopposition to the Governor, and I did not do so, but rather cooperated\r\nwith him in securing legislation which appeared to be for the public\r\ninterest. The general lack of confidence in the country and the\r\ndepression of business caused by the reduction of the tariff rates in\r\nthe fall of 1913 made it necessary to grant large appropriations for the\r\nrelief of unemployment during the winter. But I could see the steady\r\ndecrease of the radical sentiment among the people.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the following summer the World War enveloped Europe. It\r\nhad a distinctly sobering effect upon the whole people of our country.\r\nIt was very apparent in Massachusetts, where they at once began to\r\nabandon their wanderings and seek their old landmarks for guidance. The\r\ndivision in our party was giving way to reunion. Confidence was\r\nreturning.\r\n\r\nThe Republican State Committee chose me to be chairman of the committee\r\non resolutions at the state convention which met at Worcester, largely\r\nbecause of the impression made by my speech at the opening of the\r\nSenate. I drew a conservative platform, pitched in the same key,\r\npointing out the great mass of legislation our party had placed on the\r\nstatute books for the benefit of the wage earners and the welfare of the\r\npeople, but declaring for the strict and unimpaired maintenance of our\r\npresent social, economic and political institutions. While I did not\r\ndeliver it well, in print it made an effective campaign document. After\r\nstarting in the contest with little confidence, our strength increased,\r\nso that our candidate, Samuel W. McCall, received 198,627 votes and was\r\ndefeated by only 11,815 plurality. All the rest of our state ticket was\r\nvictorious. The political complexion of the Senate was completely\r\nchanged. From a bare majority of twenty-one the Republican strength rose\r\nto thirty-three, and the opposition was reduced to seven Democrats.\r\n\r\nMy district returned me for the fourth time and I was again made\r\nPresident of the Senate by a unanimous vote. My opening address\r\nconsisted of forty-two words, thanking the Senators for the honor and\r\nurging them in their conduct of business to be brief.\r\n\r\nAs a presiding officer it has constantly been my policy to dispatch\r\nbusiness. It always took a long time to get all the Committees of the\r\nGeneral Court to make their reports, but I was able to keep the daily\r\nsessions of the Senate short. I also wanted to cut down the volume of\r\nlegislation. In this some progress was made. The Blue Book of Acts and\r\nResolves for 1913 had 1,763 pages, for 1914 it had 1,423, and for 1915\r\nonly 1,230, which was a very wholesome reduction of more than thirty per\r\ncent. People were coming to see that they must depend on themselves\r\nrather than on legislation for success.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was beginning to suffer from a great complication of laws\r\nand restrictive regulations, from a multiplicity of Boards and\r\nCommissions, which had reached about one hundred, and from a large\r\nincrease in the number of people on the public pay rolls, all of which\r\nwas necessarily accompanied with a much larger cost of state government\r\nthat had to be met by collecting more revenue from the taxpayers. The\r\npeople began to realize that something was wrong and began to wonder\r\nwhether more laws, more regulations, and more taxes, were really any\r\nbenefit to them. They were becoming tired of agitation, criticism and\r\ndestructive policies and wished to return to constructive methods.\r\n\r\nWhen I went home at the end of the 1915 session it was with the\r\nintention of remaining in private life and giving all my attention to\r\nthe law. During the winter the Lieutenant-Governor had announced that\r\nhe would seek the nomination for Governor which caused some mention of\r\nme as his successor, but I was President of the Senate and did not\r\npropose to impair my usefulness in that position by involving it in an\r\neffort to secure some other office, so I gave the matter no attention. A\r\nvery estimable man who had done much party service and was a brilliant\r\nplatform speaker had already become a candidate, but although my record\r\nin the General Court was that of a liberal, the business interests\r\nturned to me. In this they were not alone as the event disclosed. To the\r\npeople I seemed, in some way that I cannot explain, to represent\r\nconfidence. When the situation became apparent to me I went to Boston\r\nand made the simple statement in the press that I was a candidate for\r\nLieutenant-Governor, without any reasons or any elaboration.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that my intimate acquaintance began with Mr. Frank\r\nW. Stearns. I had met him in a casual way for a year or two but only\r\noccasionally. In the spring he had suggested that he would like to\r\nsupport me for Lieutenant-Governor. He was a merchant of high character\r\nand very much respected by all who knew him, but entirely without\r\nexperience in politics. He came as an entirely fresh force in public\r\naffairs, unhampered by any of the animosities that usually attach to a\r\nveteran politician. It was a great compliment to me to attract the\r\ninterest of such a man, and his influence later became of large value to\r\nthe party in the Commonwealth and nation. I always felt considerable\r\npride of accomplishment in getting the active support of men like him.\r\nWhile Mr. Stearns always overestimated me, he nevertheless was a great\r\nhelp to me. He never obtruded or sought any favor for himself or any\r\nother person, but his whole effort was always disinterested and entirely\r\ndevoted to assisting me when I indicated I wished him to do so. It is\r\ndoubtful if any other public man ever had so valuable and unselfish a\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nMy activities were such that I began to see more of the Honorable W.\r\nMurray Crane. When he came to Boston he was accustomed to have me at\r\nbreakfast in his rooms at the hotel. Although he had large interests\r\nabout which there was constant legislation he never mentioned the\r\nsubject to me or made any suggestion about any of my official actions.\r\nHad I sought his advice he would have told me to consult my own judgment\r\nand vote for what the public interest required, without any thought of\r\nhim. He confirmed my opinion as to the value of a silence which avoids\r\ncreating a situation where one would otherwise not exist, and the bad\r\ntaste and the danger of arousing animosities and advertising an opponent\r\nby making any attack on him. In all political affairs he had a wonderful\r\nwisdom, and in everything he was preeminently a man of judgment, who was\r\nthe most disinterested public servant I ever saw and the greatest\r\ninfluence for good government with which I ever came in contact. What\r\nwould I not have given to have had him by my side when I was President!\r\nHis end came just before the election of 1920.\r\n\r\nThese men were additional examples of good influences coming into my\r\nlife, to which I referred in relating the experience of some of my\r\nyounger days. I cannot see that I sought them but they came. Perhaps it\r\nwas because I was ready to receive them.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1915 politics became very active in Massachusetts.\r\nThere was a sharp campaign for the nomination for Governor, my own\r\neffort to secure the Lieutenant-Governorship, and many minor contests. I\r\nshall always remember that Augustus P. Gardner, then in Congress,\r\nhonored me by becoming one of the committee of five who conducted my\r\ncampaign. Many local meetings were held, calling for much speaking. In\r\nthe end Samuel W. McCall was renominated for Governor. I was named as\r\ncandidate for Lieutenant-Governor by a vote of about 75,000 to 50,000.\r\nThe news reached my father on the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth\r\nof his father. My campaign was carried on in careful compliance with the\r\nlaw, and the expense was within the allowed limit of $1,500, which was\r\ncontributed by numerous people. I was thus under no especial obligation\r\nto any one for raising money for me.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign for election I toured the state with Mr. McCall, making\r\nopen-air speeches from automobiles during the day, and finishing with an\r\nindoor rally in the evening. It was the hardest kind of work but most\r\nfascinating. I remember that Warren G. Harding and Nicholas Longworth\r\ncame into the state to promote our election and spoke with us at a large\r\nmeeting one night at Lowell.\r\n\r\nI did not refer to my own candidacy, but spent all my time advocating\r\nthe election of Mr. McCall. He was a character that fitted into the\r\nsituation most admirably. He was liberal without being visionary and\r\nconservative without being reactionary. The twenty-five years he had\r\nspent in public life gave him a remarkable equipment for discussing the\r\nissues of a campaign. Whatever information was needed concerning the\r\nstate government I was in a position to supply. Much emphasis was placed\r\nby me on the urgent necessity of preventing further increases in state\r\nand national expense and of a drastic reduction wherever possible. The\r\nstate was ready for that kind of a message.\r\n\r\nWhen the election of 1915 came, Mr. McCall won by 6,313 votes and my\r\nplurality was 52,204. After having been held five years by Democrats,\r\nthe Governorship of Massachusetts was restored to the Republican party,\r\nwhere it was to remain for the next fifteen years and probably much\r\nlonger. The extended struggle in which the Republicans had been engaged\r\nto restore the people of Massachusetts to their allegiance to sound\r\ngovernment under a reunited party had at last been successful. With that\r\nprolonged effort I had been intimately associated.\r\n\r\nThe office of Lieutenant-Governor of Massachusetts differs from that of\r\nmost states. As already disclosed he does not preside over the Senate.\r\nThe constitution of our Commonwealth is older than the Federal\r\nConstitution and so followed the old colonial system, while most of the\r\nstates have followed the Federal system. I was _ex officio_ a member of\r\nthe Governor’s Council and chairman of the Finance and Pardon\r\ncommittees. As the Council met but one day each week I was pleased with\r\nthe renewed opportunity I expected to have to practice law. But it soon\r\ndeveloped that I must be away so much that I asked Ralph W. Hemenway to\r\nbecome associated with me, and he has since carried on my law office so\r\nsuccessfully that it has become his law office rather than mine.\r\n\r\nIt has become the custom in our country to expect all Chief Executives,\r\nfrom the President down, to conduct activities analogous to an\r\nentertainment bureau. No occasion is too trivial for its promoters to\r\ninvite them to attend and deliver an address. It appeared to be the\r\npractice of Governor McCall to accept all these invitations and when the\r\ntime came, to attend what he could of them, and parcel the rest out\r\namong his subordinates. In this way I became very much engaged. It was\r\nan honor to represent the Governor, and a part of my duties according to\r\nour practice. Some days I went to several meetings for that purpose,\r\nranging well into the night, so I was obliged to stay in Boston most of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period that I wrote nearly all of the speeches\r\nafterwards published in “Have Faith in Massachusetts.” They were short\r\nand mostly committed to memory for delivery. This forced me to be a\r\nconstant student of public questions.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem best for me to take a very active part in the\r\nPresidential primaries of 1916, but I quietly supported the regular\r\nticket for delegates, which was elected. We had at least three\r\ncandidates for President in Massachusetts, with all of whom I was on\r\nfriendly terms, as I had never allied myself with any faction of the\r\nparty, but I felt the convention did the wise thing in turning to the\r\ngreat statesman Charles Evans Hughes, and I supported him actively in\r\nthe campaign for election. He carried Massachusetts by a small vote. My\r\nrenomination came without opposition, as did that of the Governor, who\r\nhad a plurality of 46,240 at the election. My own was 84,930.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer I had been chairman of a special commission to\r\nconsider the financial condition of the Boston Elevated Street Railway,\r\nand helped make a report recommending that the Governor be authorized to\r\nappoint a Board of Trustees who should have the control of this property\r\nand be vested with authority to fix a rate of fare sufficient to pay the\r\ncosts of operation and a fair return to the stockholders. This was\r\nadopted by the General Court and solved the pressing problem of street\r\nrailway transportation, which became so acute on account of the\r\nincreasing costs of operation. Later the plan was applied to the other\r\nlarge company in the eastern part of the state. It was not perfect, but\r\nsaved the properties from destruction and gave a fair means of travel\r\nat cost, which was to be ascertained by public authority.\r\n\r\nIt was in the ensuing year that the United States entered the World War.\r\nWhile this took most of our thoughts off local affairs it did not\r\nprevent opposition to the renomination of Governor McCall. Had it been\r\nsuccessful it would have deferred any chance for me to run for Governor\r\nfor two or three years and probably indefinitely. Under the\r\ncircumstances most of my friends supported the Governor, and he was\r\nrenominated by a wide margin. I had no opposition. But interest in the\r\nelection was not great, so that the vote was light. Nevertheless the\r\nGovernor ran 90,479 votes ahead of his nearest competitor. In my own\r\ncontest my opponent secured the Democratic, the Progressive and the\r\nProhibition nomination. I did not think the combination would prove\r\nhelpful to him, and it did not. He fell off 77,000 from the vote of his\r\npredecessor, and I won by 101,731.\r\n\r\nWhile the United States had been engaged in the World War every public\r\nman, and I among them, had been constantly employed in its many\r\nactivities. It increased every function of government from the\r\nadministration in Washington down to the smallest town office. The whole\r\nnation seemed to be endowed with a new spirit, unified and solidified\r\nand willing to make any sacrifice for the cause of liberty. I was\r\nconstantly before public gatherings explaining the needs of the time for\r\nmen, money and supplies. Sometimes I was urging subscriptions for war\r\nloans, sometimes contributions to the great charities, or again speaking\r\nto the workmen engaged in construction or the manufacture of munitions.\r\nThe response which the people made and the organizing power of the\r\ncountry were all manifestations that it was wonderful to contemplate.\r\nThe entire nation awoke to a new life.\r\n\r\nIt was no secret that I desired to be Governor. Under the custom of\r\npromotion in Massachusetts a man who did not expect to be advanced would\r\nscarcely be willing to be Lieutenant-Governor. But I did nothing in the\r\nway of organizing my friends to secure the nomination. It is much better\r\nnot to press a candidacy too much, but to let it develop on its own\r\nmerits without artificial stimulation. If the people want a man they\r\nwill nominate him, if they do not want him he had best let the\r\nnomination go to another.\r\n\r\nThe Governor very much desired to be United States Senator, but made no\r\nstatement indicating he would seek that honor which would cause him to\r\nretire from his present office. Neither I nor my friends approached him\r\nor sought to influence him. Finally he called me aside and told me to\r\nannounce that I would run for Governor, which I did. As no one knew what\r\nhe had told me, some supposed I would run against him, which I would not\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nI had a strong liking for this veteran public servant, and so I felt\r\nsure he liked me. He was away on many occasions, which under the\r\nconstitution left me as Acting Governor, but at such times I was always\r\ncareful not to encroach upon his domain. While I may have differed with\r\nmy subordinates I have always supported loyally my superiors. They have\r\nnever found me organizing a camp in opposition to them. Finally the\r\nGovernor sought the Senatorship, but before his campaign was under way\r\nhe very manfully announced that as the country was at war he was\r\nentirely unwilling to divert public attention from the national defense\r\nto promote his political fortune and therefore withdrew. My nomination\r\nwas again unanimous.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was difficult. The really great qualities of my principal\r\ncolleague, Senator John W. Weeks, had been displayed mostly in\r\nWashington and were not appreciated by his home people. A violent\r\nepidemic of influenza prevented us from having a State Convention, or\r\nholding the usual meetings, and the party organization was not very\r\neffective. In spite of my protest and the fact that we were engaged in a\r\ntremendous war, criticism was too often made of President Wilson and his\r\nadministration. My own efforts were spent in urging that the people and\r\ngovernment of Massachusetts should all join in their support of the\r\nnational government in prosecuting the war. While I was elected by only\r\n16,773, Senator Weeks to my lasting regret was defeated, so the state\r\nand nation lost for a time the benefit of his valuable public service.\r\nLater he was in the Cabinet where he remained until, during my term, he\r\nretired due to ill health, and did not long survive.\r\n\r\nAgain I supposed I had reached the summit of any possible political\r\npreferment and was quite content to finish my public career as Governor\r\nof Massachusetts--an office that has always been held in the highest\r\nhonor by the people of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nTo get a few days’ rest I went to Maine the next Friday after the\r\nelection. It was there that I was awakened in the middle of Sunday night\r\nto be told that the Armistice had been signed. I returned to Boston the\r\nfollowing day to take part in the celebration. What the end of the four\r\nyears of carnage meant those who remember it will never forget and those\r\nwho do not can never be told. The universal joy, the enormous relief,\r\nfound expression from all the people in a spontaneous outburst of\r\nthanksgiving.\r\n\r\nWhile the war was done, its problems were to confront the state and\r\nnation for many years. I was to meet them as Governor and President.\r\nThey will remain with us for two generations. Such is the curse of war.\r\n\r\nIn my inaugural address I dwelt on the need of promoting the public\r\nhealth, education, and the opportunity, for employment at fair wages in\r\naccordance with the right of the people to be well born, well reared,\r\nwell educated, well employed and well paid. I also stressed the\r\nnecessity of keeping government expenses as low as possible, assisting\r\nin every possible way the reestablishing of the returning veterans, and\r\nreorganizing the numerous departments in accordance with a recent change\r\nof the constitution which limited their number to twenty.\r\n\r\nThere being no Executive Mansion the Governor has no especial social\r\nduties, so I kept my quarters at the Adams House, as I had always lived\r\nthere when in Boston, where Mrs. Coolidge came sometimes; but as our\r\nboys needed her she staid for the most part in Northampton. She never\r\nhad taken any part in my political life, but had given her attention to\r\nour home. It was not until we went to Washington that she came into\r\npublic prominence and favor.\r\n\r\nIn February, President Wilson landed at Boston on his return from France\r\nand spoke at a large meeting, where I made a short address of welcome,\r\npledging him my support in helping settle the remaining war problems. I\r\nthen began a friendly personal relation with him and Mrs. Wilson which\r\nhas always continued. Our service men were constantly returning and had\r\nto be aided in getting back into private employment. About $20,000,000\r\nwas paid them out of the state treasury.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion attending the end of the war the work of legislation\r\ndragged on well into the summer. While I did not veto many of the bills\r\nwhich were passed, I did reject a measure to increase the salaries of\r\nmembers of the General Court from $1,000 to $1,500, but my objection was\r\nnot sustained.\r\n\r\nIn the great upward movement of wages that had taken place those paid by\r\nstreet railways had not been proportionately increased. It is very\r\ndifficult to raise fares, so sufficient money for this purpose had not\r\nbeen available, though some advances had been made. Because of this\r\nsituation a strike occurred in midsummer on the Boston Elevated that\r\ntied up nearly all the street transportation in the city district for\r\nthree or four days. Finally I helped negotiate an agreement to send the\r\nmatter to arbitration, so that work was resumed. The men secured a very\r\nmaterial raise in wages, which I feel later conditions fully justified.\r\n\r\nIn August I went to Vermont. On my return I found that difficulties in\r\nthe Police Department of Boston were growing serious and made a\r\nstatement to the reporters at the State House that I should support\r\nCommissioner Edwin U. Curtis in his decisions concerning their\r\nadjustment. I felt he was entitled to every confidence.\r\n\r\nThe trouble arose over the proposal of the policemen, who had long been\r\npermitted to maintain a local organization of their own, to form a union\r\nand affiliate with the American Federation of Labor. That was contrary\r\nto a long-established rule of the Department, which was agreed to by\r\neach member when he went on the force and had the effect of law.\r\n\r\nWhen the policemen’s union persisted in its course I was urged by a\r\ncommittee appointed by the Mayor to interfere and attempt to make\r\nCommissioner Curtis settle the dispute by arbitration. The Governor\r\nappoints the Commissioner and probably could remove him, but he has no\r\nmore jurisdiction over his acts than he has over the Judges of the\r\nCourts; besides, I did not see how it was possible to arbitrate the\r\nquestion of the authority of the law, or of the necessity of obedience\r\nto the rules of the Department and the orders of the Commissioner. These\r\nprinciples were the heart of the whole controversy and the only\r\nimportant questions at issue. It can readily be seen how important they\r\nwere and what the effect might have been if they had not been\r\nmaintained. I decided to support them whatever the consequences might\r\nbe. I fully expected it would result in my defeat in the coming campaign\r\nfor reelection as Governor.\r\n\r\nWhile I had no direct responsibility for the conduct of police matters\r\nin Boston, yet as the Chief Executive it was my general duty to require\r\nthe laws to be enforced, so I remained in Boston and kept carefully\r\ninformed of conditions. I knew I might be called on to act at any time.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, September seventh, I went to Northampton by motor and\r\nremained overnight as I had an engagement to speak before a state\r\nconvention of the American Federation of Labor at Greenfield Monday\r\nmorning, which I fulfilled. I left that town at once for Boston,\r\nstopping at Fitchburg to call my office to learn if there were any new\r\ndevelopments. I reached Boston after four o’clock that afternoon, and\r\nhad a conference with some of the representatives of the city. I did not\r\nleave Boston again for a long time.\r\n\r\nWhen it became perfectly apparent that the policemen’s union was acting\r\nin violation of the rules of the Department the leaders were brought\r\nbefore the Commissioner on charges, tried and removed from office,\r\nwhereat about three-quarters of the force left the Department in a body\r\nat about five o’clock on the afternoon of Tuesday, September ninth. This\r\nnumber was much larger than had been expected.\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Police of more than one hundred, and the State Police\r\nof thirty or forty men, had been kept in readiness and were at once put\r\non duty, the Motor Corps of the State Guard was held at the armory, and\r\nthat night I kept the Attorney General, the Adjutant General and my\r\nSecretary at my hotel to be ready to respond to any call for help. As\r\neverything was quiet the Motor Corps went home. Around midnight bands of\r\nmen appeared on the street, who broke many shop windows and carried away\r\nquantities of the goods which were on display. Many arrests were made,\r\nbut the remaining police and their reinforcements were not sufficient to\r\nprevent the disorder. I knew nothing of this until morning.\r\n\r\nThe disorder of Tuesday night was most reprehensible, but it was only an\r\nincident. It had little relation to the real issues. I have always felt\r\nthat I should have called out the State Guard as soon as the police left\r\ntheir posts. The Commissioner did not feel this was necessary. The\r\nMayor, who was a man of high character, and a personal friend, but of\r\nthe opposite party, had conferred with me. He had the same authority as\r\nthe Governor to call out all the Guard in the City of Boston. It would\r\nbe very unusual for a Governor to act except on the request of the\r\nlocal authorities. No disorder existed, and it would have been rather a\r\nviolent assumption that it was threatened, but it could have been made.\r\nSuch action probably would have saved some property, but would have\r\ndecided no issue. In fact it would have made it more difficult to\r\nmaintain the position Mr. Curtis had taken, and which I was supporting,\r\nbecause the issue was not understood, and the disorder focused public\r\nattention on it, and showed just what it meant to have a police force\r\nthat did not obey orders.\r\n\r\nOn reaching my office in the morning it was reported to me that the\r\nMayor was calling out the State Guard of Boston to report about five\r\no’clock that afternoon. He also requested me to furnish more troops. I\r\nsupplemented his action by calling substantially the entire State Guard\r\nto report at once. They gathered at their armories and were patrolling\r\nthe streets in a few hours. When they came with their muskets in their\r\nhands with bayonets fixed there was little more trouble from disorder.\r\n\r\nIt was soon reported to me that the Mayor, acting under a special law,\r\nhad taken charge of the police force of the city, and by putting a\r\nGuard officer in command had virtually displaced the Commissioner, who\r\ncame to me in great distress. If he was to be superseded I thought the\r\nmen that he had discharged might be taken back and the cause lost.\r\nCertainly they and the rest of the policemen’s union must have rejoiced\r\nat his discomfort. Thinking I knew what to do, I consulted the law as is\r\nmy custom. I found a general statute that gives the Governor authority\r\nto call on any police officer in the state to assist him. I showed this\r\nto the Attorney General and to Ex-Attorney General Herbert Parker, who\r\nwas advising Mr. Curtis. They thought I was right and consulted a\r\nprofound judge of law, Ex-Attorney General Albert E. Pillsbury, who\r\nconfirmed their opinions. The strike occurred Tuesday night, the Guard\r\nwere called Wednesday, and Thursday I issued a General Order restoring\r\nMr. Curtis to his place as Commissioner in control of the police, and\r\nmade a proclamation calling on all citizens to assist me in preserving\r\norder, and especially directing all police officers in Boston to obey\r\nthe orders of Mr. Curtis.\r\n\r\nThis was the important contribution I made to the tactics of the\r\nsituation, which has never been fully realized. To Mr. Curtis should go\r\nthe credit for raising the issue and enforcing the principle that police\r\nshould not affiliate with any outside body, whether of wage earners or\r\nof wage payers, but should remain unattached, impartial officers of the\r\nlaw, with sole allegiance to the public. In this I supported him.\r\n\r\nWhen rumors started of a strike at the power house which furnished\r\nelectricity for all Boston, a naval vessel was run up to the station\r\nwith plenty of electricians on board ready to go over the side and keep\r\nthe plant in operation. A wagon train of supplies, arms, and ammunition\r\nwas brought in from Camp Devens and all the State Guard mobilized. A\r\nstatement was made by President Wilson strongly condemning the defection\r\nof the police. Volunteer police began to come in, and over half a\r\nmillion dollars was raised by popular subscription to meet necessary\r\nexpenses in caring for dependents of the Guard and even for helping the\r\nfamilies of some of the police who left their posts. Later I helped\r\nthese men in securing other employment, but refused to allow them again\r\nto be policemen. Public feeling became very much aroused. While offers\r\nof support came from every quarter the opposition was very active.\r\n\r\nSoon, Samuel Gompers began to telegraph me asking the removal of Mr.\r\nCurtis and the reinstatement of the union policemen. This required me to\r\nmake a reply in which I stated among other things that “There is no\r\nright to strike against the public safety by any body, any time, any\r\nwhere.” This phrase caught the attention of the nation. It was beginning\r\nto be clear that if voluntary associations were to be permitted to\r\nsubstitute their will for the authority of public officials the end of\r\nour government was at hand. The issue was nothing less than whether the\r\nlaw which the people had made through their duly authorized agencies\r\nshould be supreme.\r\n\r\nThis issue I took to the people in my campaign for reelection as\r\nGovernor. Though I was hampered by an attack of influenza and spoke but\r\nthree or four times, I was able to make the issue plain even beyond the\r\nconfines of Massachusetts. Many of the wage earners both organized and\r\nunorganized, who knew I had always treated them fairly, must have\r\nsupported me, for I won by 125,101 votes. The people decided in favor\r\nof the integrity of their own government. President Wilson sent me a\r\ntelegram of congratulations.\r\n\r\nI felt at the time that the speeches I made and the statements I issued\r\nhad a clearness of thought and revealed a power I had not before been\r\nable to express, which confirmed my belief that, when a duty comes to\r\nus, with it a power comes to enable us to perform it. I was not thinking\r\nso much of the Governorship, which I already had, as of the grave danger\r\nto the country if the voters did not decide correctly. My faith that the\r\npeople would respond to the truth was justified.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the situation as it developed seem clear and plain\r\nnow, and easy to decide, but as they arose they were very complicated\r\nand involved in many immaterial issues. The right thing to do never\r\nrequires any subterfuges, it is always simple and direct. That is the\r\nreason that intrigue usually falls of its own weight.\r\n\r\nAfter the election I had the work of making the appointments in order to\r\nreduce the entire state administration to the limit of twenty\r\nDepartments and a special session of the General Court to deal with some\r\nstreet railway problems, so I had little time to think of politics. But\r\nI soon learned that many people in the country were thinking of me.\r\n\r\nThe two years that I served as Governor were a time of transition from\r\nwar to peace. New problems constantly arose, great confusion prevailed,\r\nnothing was settled and it was possible only to feel my way from day to\r\nday. But they were years of progress if partly in a negative way. The\r\nnew position of the wage earners was perfected and solidified. A\r\nforty-eight-hour week for women and minors was established by a bill\r\npassed by the General Court, which I signed. The budget system went\r\nfully into effect the first year I was Governor and helped keep the\r\nstate finances in good condition. The departments were reorganized, and\r\nthe street railways given relief. In my second year a bill was passed\r\nallowing the sale of beer with a 2.75 per cent alcoholic content, which\r\nI vetoed because I thought it was in violation of the Constitution which\r\nI had sworn to defend. The veto was sustained. A constant struggle\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nWide World Photos\r\n\r\nCALVIN COOLIDGE\r\n\r\n_At Amherst College_]\r\n\r\nwas going on to keep the costs of living down and the rate of wages up.\r\nA State Commission was held in office with increased powers to resist\r\nprofiteering in the necessaries of life. In the depression of 1920 some\r\nof our banks and manufacturers found themselves in difficulties. All of\r\nthese things reached the Governor in one form or another. But, in\r\ngeneral, conditions were such that the entire efforts of the people were\r\nengaged in easing themselves down. There was little opportunity to\r\ndirect their attention towards constructive action. They were clearing\r\naway the refuse from the great conflagration preparatory to rebuilding\r\non a grander and more pretentious scale. Nothing was natural, everything\r\nwas artificial. So much energy had to be expended in keeping the ship of\r\nstate on a straight course that there was little left to carry it ahead.\r\nBut when I finished my two terms in January, 1921, the demobilization of\r\nthe country was practically complete, people had found themselves again,\r\nand were ready to undertake the great work of reconstruction in which\r\nthey have since been so successfully engaged. In that work we have seen\r\nthe people of America create a new heaven and a new earth. The old\r\nthings have passed away, giving place to a glory never before\r\nexperienced by any people of our world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN NATIONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER FOUR_\r\n\r\nIN NATIONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nNo doubt it was the police strike of Boston that brought me into\r\nnational prominence. That furnished the occasion and I took advantage of\r\nthe opportunity. I was ready to meet the emergency. Just what lay behind\r\nthat event I was never able to learn. Sometimes I have mistrusted that\r\nit was a design to injure me politically; if so it was only to recoil\r\nupon the perpetrators, for it increased my political power many fold.\r\nStill there was a day or two when the event hung in the balance, when\r\nthe Police Commissioner of Boston, Edwin U. Curtis, was apparently cast\r\naside discredited, and my efforts to give him any support indicated my\r\nown undoing. But I soon had him reinstated, and there was a strong\r\nexpression of public opinion in our favor.\r\n\r\nThe year 1919 had not produced much on the positive side of our\r\npolitical life. President Wilson had returned from the peace conference\r\nat Paris determined to have the United States join the League of Nations\r\nas established in the final Treaty of Versailles. He found opposition in\r\nthe Senate both within and without his own party. In attempting to gain\r\nthe approval of the country he had made his trip across the continent\r\nand returned a broken man never to regain his strength. For eight years\r\nhe had so dominated his party that it had not produced any one else with\r\na marked ability for leadership. During these months the contest was\r\nraging in the Senate over the peace treaty, but as a result it had put\r\nthe leadership of our party in a negative position, which never appeals\r\nto the popular imagination, and besides in the country many Republicans\r\nfavored a ratification of the treaty with adequate reservations. Many of\r\nthe Senators on our side cast their vote for that proposal, which would\r\nhave prevailed but for the opposition of the regular administration\r\nDemocrats. In this confusion no dominant popular figure emerged in the\r\nCongress, but many ambitions became apparent.\r\n\r\nFollowing my decisive victory in November there very soon came to be\r\nmention of me as a Presidential candidate. About Thanksgiving time\r\nSenator Lodge came to me and voluntarily requested that he should\r\npresent my name to the national Republican convention. He wished to go\r\nas a delegate with that understanding. Of course I told him I could not\r\nmake any decision in relation to being a candidate, but I would try to\r\narrange matters so that he could be a delegate at large. When he left\r\nfor Washington he gave out an interview saying that Massachusetts should\r\nsupport me.\r\n\r\nVery soon a movement of considerable dimensions started both in my home\r\nstate and in other sections of the country to secure delegates who would\r\nsupport me. An old friend and long time Secretary of the Republican\r\nNational Committee, James B. Reynolds, was placed in charge of the\r\nmovement, and I was gaining considerable strength. Senator Crane in his\r\nown quiet but highly efficient way became very interested and let it be\r\nknown that I had his support, as did Speaker Gillett, who is now our\r\nSenator, but then represented my home district in Congress. They both\r\nwent as delegates pledged to me.\r\n\r\nAlready several candidates were making a very active campaign. The two\r\nmost conspicuous were Major General Leonard Wood and Governor Frank O.\r\nLowden. Senator Hiram Johnson had considerable support, and in a more\r\nmodest way Senator Warren G. Harding was in the field. In addition to\r\nthese, several of the states had favorite sons. It soon began to be\r\nreported that very large sums of money were being used in the primaries.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to give the matter serious attention, and comprehended more\r\nfully what would be involved in a contest of this kind, I realized that\r\nI was not in a position to become engaged in it. I was Governor of\r\nMassachusetts, and my first duty was to that office. It would not be\r\npossible for me, with the legislature in session, to be going about the\r\ncountry actively participating in an effort to secure delegates, and I\r\nwas totally unwilling to have a large sum of money raised and spent in\r\nmy behalf.\r\n\r\nI soon became convinced also that I was in danger of creating a\r\nsituation in which some people in Massachusetts could permit it to be\r\nreported in the press that they were for me when they were not at heart\r\nfor me and would give me little support in the convention. It would,\r\nhowever, prevent their having to make a public choice as between other\r\ncandidates and would help them in getting elected as delegates. There\r\nwas nothing unusual in this situation. It was simply a condition that\r\nalways has to be met in politics. Of course the strategy of the other\r\ncandidates was to prevent me from having a solid Massachusetts\r\ndelegation. Moreover, I did not wish to use the office of Governor in an\r\nattempt to prosecute a campaign for nomination for some other office. I\r\ntherefore made a public statement announcing that I was unwilling to\r\nappear as a candidate and would not enter my name in any contest at the\r\nprimaries. This left me in a position where I ran no risk of\r\nembarrassing the great office of Governor of Massachusetts. That was my\r\nanswer to the situation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless a considerable activity was kept up in my behalf, and some\r\nmoney expended, mostly in circulating a book of my speeches. In the\r\nMassachusetts primaries six or seven delegates were chosen who were for\r\nGeneral Wood, and while the rest were nominally for me several of them\r\nwere really more favorable to some other candidate, partly because they\r\nsupposed a Massachusetts man could never be nominated, and if the choice\r\nwas going outside the state, they had strong preferences as between the\r\nother possibilities.\r\n\r\nAt a state convention in South Dakota held very early to express a\r\npreference for national candidates I had been declared their choice for\r\nVice-President. Some people in Oregon desired to accord me a like honor.\r\nAs I did not wish my name to appear in any contest and did not care to\r\nbe Vice-President I declined to be considered for that office. In my\r\nnative state of Vermont it was proposed to enter my name in the primary\r\nas candidate for President, which I could not permit. Nevertheless it\r\nwas written on the ballot by many of the voters at the polls.\r\n\r\nWhen the Republican National Convention met at Chicago, Senator Lodge,\r\nwho was elected its chairman, had indicated that he did not wish to\r\npresent my name, so it was arranged that Speaker Gillett should make the\r\nnominating speech. Massachusetts had thirty-five delegates. On the\r\nfirst ballot I received twenty-eight of their votes and six others from\r\nscattering states, making my total thirty-four. As the balloting\r\nproceeded a considerable number of the Massachusetts delegates, feeling\r\nI had no chance, voted for other candidates, but a majority remained\r\nwith me until the final ballot when all but one went elsewhere, and\r\nSenator Warren G. Harding was nominated. My friends in the convention\r\ndid all they could for me, and several states were at times ready to\r\ncome to me if the entire Massachusetts delegation would lead the way,\r\nbut some of them refused to vote for me, so the support of other states\r\ncould not be secured.\r\n\r\nWhile I do not think it was so intended I have always been of the\r\nopinion that this turned out to be much the best for me. I had no\r\nnational experience. What I have ever been able to do has been the\r\nresult of first learning how to do it. I am not gifted with intuition. I\r\nneed not only hard work but experience to be ready to solve problems.\r\nThe Presidents who have gone to Washington without first having held\r\nsome national office have been at great disadvantage. It takes them a\r\nlong time to become acquainted with the Federal officeholders and the\r\nFederal Government. Meanwhile they have had difficulty in dealing with\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1920 was largely under the domination of a coterie of\r\nUnited States Senators. They maneuvered it into adopting a platform and\r\nnominating a President in ways that were not satisfactory to a majority\r\nof the delegates. When the same forces undertook for a third time to\r\ndictate the action of the convention in naming a Vice-President, the\r\ndelegates broke away from them and literally stampeded to me.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts did not present my name, because my friends knew I did not\r\nwish to be Vice-President, but Judge Wallace McCamant of Oregon placed\r\nme in nomination and was quickly seconded by North Dakota and some other\r\nstates. I received about three-quarters of all the votes cast. When this\r\nhonor came to me I was pleased to accept, and it was especially\r\nagreeable to be associated with Senator Harding, whom I knew well and\r\nliked.\r\n\r\nWhen our campaign opened, the situation was complex. Many Republicans\r\ndid not like the somewhat uncertain tone of the platform concerning the\r\nLeague of Nations. Though it was generally conceded that the\r\nbitter-enders had dictated the platform there were some who felt it was\r\nnot explicit enough in denouncing the League with all its works and\r\neverything foreign, and a much larger body of Republicans were much\r\ndisappointed that it did not declare in favor of ratifying the treaty\r\nwith reservations.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Republican State Convention in the fall of 1919 had\r\nadopted a plank favoring immediate ratification with suitable\r\nreservations which would safeguard American interests. While later the\r\ntreaty had been rejected by the Senate it was still necessary to make a\r\nformal agreement of peace with the Central Powers, and for that purpose\r\nsome treaty would be necessary. Many Republicans favored our entry into\r\nthe League as a method of closing up the war period and helping\r\nstabilize world conditions. Senator Crane had taken that position in\r\nMassachusetts and repeated it again at Chicago.\r\n\r\nSince that time the situation has changed. The war period has closed\r\nand a separate treaty has been made and ratified. The more I have seen\r\nof the conduct of our foreign relations the more I am convinced that we\r\nare better off out of the League. Our government is not organized in a\r\nway that would enable us adequately to deal with it. Nominally our\r\nforeign affairs are in the hands of the President. Actually the Senate\r\nis always attempting to interfere, too often in a partisan way and many\r\ntimes in opposition to the President. Our country is not racially\r\nhomogeneous. While the several nationalities represented here are loyal\r\nto the United States, yet when differences arise between European\r\ncountries, each group is naturally in sympathy with the nation of its\r\norigin. Our actions in the League would constantly be embarrassed by\r\nthis situation at home. The votes of our delegates there would all the\r\ntime disturb our domestic tranquillity here. We have come to realize\r\nthis situation very completely now, but in 1920 it was not so clear.\r\n\r\nAt that time we were close to the war. Our sympathies were very much\r\nwith our allies and a great body of sentiment in our country, which may\r\nbe called the missionary spirit, was strongly in favor of helping\r\nEurope. To them the League meant an instrument for that end. That was a\r\npraiseworthy spirit and had to be reckoned with in dealing with the\r\npeople in a political campaign. This sentiment was very marked in the\r\nEast where it had a strong hold on a very substantial element of the\r\nRepublican party.\r\n\r\nWhile I was taking a short vacation in Vermont several thousand people\r\ncame to my father’s home to greet me. I spent most of my time, however,\r\nin preparing my speech of acceptance. The notification ceremonies were\r\nheld on a pleasant afternoon in midsummer at Northampton in Allen Field,\r\nwhich was part of the college grounds, and its former President, the\r\nvenerable Dr. L. Clark Seelye, presided. The chairman of the\r\nnotification committee was Governor Morrow of Kentucky. A great throng\r\nrepresenting many different states was in attendance to hear my address.\r\nI was careful to reassure those who feared we were not proposing to\r\ncontinue our cooperation with Europe in attempting to solve the war\r\nproblems in a way that would provide for a permanent peace of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nNot being the head of the ticket, of course, it was not my place to\r\nraise issues or create policies, but I had the privilege of discussing\r\nthose already declared in the platform or stated in the addresses of\r\nSenator Harding. This I undertook to do in a speech I made at Portland,\r\nMaine, where I again pointed out the wish of our party to have our\r\ncountry associated with other countries in advancing human welfare.\r\nLater in the campaign I reiterated this position at New York.\r\n\r\nThis was not intended as a subterfuge to win votes, but as a candid\r\nstatement of party principles. It was later to be put into practical\r\neffect by President Harding, in the important treaty dealing with our\r\ninternational relations in the Pacific Ocean, in the agreement for the\r\nlimitation of naval armaments, in the proposal to enter the World Court,\r\nand finally by me in the World Peace Treaty. All that I said and more in\r\njustification of support of the Republican ticket by those interested in\r\npromoting peace, without committing our country to interfere where we\r\nhad little interest, has been abundantly borne out by the events.\r\n\r\nShortly before election I made a tour of eight days, going from\r\nPhiladelphia by special train west to Tennessee and Kentucky and south\r\nas far as North Carolina. We had a most encouraging reception on this\r\ntrip, speaking out-of-doors, mostly from the rear platform during the\r\nday, with an indoor meeting at night. During the campaign I spoke in\r\nabout a dozen states.\r\n\r\nThe country was already feeling acutely the results of deflation.\r\nBusiness was depressed. For months following the Armistice we had\r\npersisted in a course of much extravagance and reckless buying. Wages\r\nhad been paid that were not earned. The whole country, from the national\r\ngovernment down, had been living on borrowed money. Pay day had come,\r\nand it was found our capital had been much impaired. In an address at\r\nPhiladelphia I contended that the only sure method of relieving this\r\ndistress was for the country to follow the advice of Benjamin Franklin\r\nand begin to work and save. Our productive capacity is sufficient to\r\nmaintain us all in a state of prosperity if we give sufficient attention\r\nto thrift and industry. Within a year the country had adopted that\r\ncourse, which has brought an era of great plenty.\r\n\r\nWhen the election came it appeared that we had held practically the\r\nentire Republican vote and had gained enormously from all those groups\r\nwho have been in this country so short a time that they still retain a\r\nmarked race consciousness. Many of them had left Europe to escape from\r\nthe prevailing conditions there. While they were loyal to the United\r\nStates they did not wish to become involved in any old world disputes,\r\nwere greatly relieved that the war was finished, and generally opposed\r\nto the League of Nations. Such a combination gave us an overwhelming\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nAfter election it was necessary for me to attend a good many\r\ncelebrations. My home town of Northampton had a large mass meeting at\r\nwhich several speeches were made. In Boston a series of dinners and\r\nlunches were given in my honor. Shortly before Christmas Mrs. Coolidge\r\nand I paid a brief visit to Mr. and Mrs. Harding at their home in\r\nMarion, Ohio. They received us in the most gracious manner. It was no\r\nsecret to us why their friends had so much affection for them.\r\n\r\nWe discussed at length the plans for his administration. The members of\r\nhis Cabinet were considered and he renewed the invitation to me, already\r\npublicly expressed, to sit with them. The policies he wished to adopt\r\nfor restoring the prosperity of the country by reducing taxes and\r\nrevising the tariff were referred to more casually. He was sincerely\r\ndevoted to the public welfare and desirous of improving the condition of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nWhen at last another Governor was inaugurated to take my place and the\r\nguns on Boston Common were giving him their first salute, Mrs. Coolidge\r\nand I were leaving for home from the North Station on the afternoon\r\ntrain which I had used so much before I was Governor. It had only day\r\ncoaches and no parlor car, but we were accustomed to travel that way and\r\nonly anxious to go home. For nine years I had been in public life in\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the winter I made an address before the Vermont Historical\r\nSociety at Montpelier and spoke later at the Town Hall in New York for a\r\ngroup of ladies who were restoring the birthplace of Theodore\r\nRoosevelt.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief stay at Northampton, Mrs. Coolidge and I went to Atlanta\r\nwhere I spoke before the Southern Tariff Association. A great deal of\r\nhospitality was lavished upon us by the state officials and the people\r\nin the city. In a few days we went to Asheville, North Carolina, where\r\nwe remained about two weeks. The Grove Park Inn entertained us with\r\neverything that could be wished, and the region was delightful.\r\n\r\nWhen the Massachusetts electors met, Judge Henry P. Field of the firm\r\nwhere I read law, who had moved my admission to the Bar, now had the\r\nexperience of nominating me for Vice-President. Twenty-four years had\r\nintervened between these two services which he performed for me.\r\n\r\nThe time soon came for us to go to Washington. A large crowd of our\r\nfriends was at the station to bid us goodbye although the hour was very\r\nearly. We went a few days before March 4 in order to have a little time\r\nto get settled. The Vice-President and Mrs. Marshall met us and gave us\r\nevery attention and courtesy. When Mr. and Mrs. Harding arrived, we went\r\nto the station to meet them and they took us back with them to the New\r\nWillard--where we too were staying--in the White House car President\r\nWilson sent for them.\r\n\r\nAbout ten-thirty the next morning a committee of the Congress came to\r\nescort us to the White House where the President and Mrs. Wilson joined\r\nus and we went to the Capitol. Soon President Wilson sent for me and\r\nsaid his health was such it would not be wise for him to remain for the\r\ninauguration and bade me goodbye. I never saw him again except at a\r\ndistance, but he sent me a most sympathetic letter when I became\r\nPresident. Such was the passing of a great world figure.\r\n\r\nAs I had already taken a leading part in seven inaugurations and\r\nwitnessed four others in Massachusetts, the experience was not new to\r\nme, but I was struck by the lack of order and formality that prevailed.\r\nA part of the ceremony takes place in the Senate Chamber and a part on\r\nthe east portico, which destroys all semblance of unity and continuity.\r\nI was sworn in before the Senate and made a very brief address dwelling\r\non the great value of a deliberative body as a safeguard of our\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nIt was a clear but crisp spring day out-of-doors where the oath was\r\nadministered to the President by Chief Justice White. The inaugural\r\naddress was able and well received. President Harding had an impressive\r\ndelivery, which never failed to interest and hold his audience. I was to\r\nhear him many times in the next two years, but whether on formal\r\noccasions or in the freedom of Gridiron dinners, his charm and\r\neffectiveness never failed.\r\n\r\nWhen the inauguration was over I realized that the same thing for which\r\nI had worked in Massachusetts had been accomplished in the nation. The\r\nradicalism which had tinged our whole political and economic life from\r\nsoon after 1900 to the World War period was passed. There were still\r\nechoes of it, and some of its votaries remained, but its power was gone.\r\nThe country had little interest in mere destructive criticism. It wanted\r\nthe progress that alone comes from constructive policies.\r\n\r\nIt had been our intention to take a house in Washington, but we found\r\nnone to our liking. They were too small or too large. It was necessary\r\nfor me to live within my income, which was little more than my salary\r\nand was charged with the cost of sending my boys to school. We therefore\r\ntook two bedrooms with a dining room, and large reception room at the\r\nNew Willard where we had every convenience.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive a person finding himself in a situation\r\nwhich calls on him to maintain a position he cannot pay for. Any other\r\ncourse for me would have been cut short by the barnyard philosophy of my\r\nfather, who would have contemptuously referred to such action as the\r\nsenseless imitation of a fowl which was attempting to light higher than\r\nit could roost. There is no dignity quite so impressive, and no\r\nindependence quite so important, as living within your means. In our\r\ncountry a small income is usually less embarrassing than the possession\r\nof a large one.\r\n\r\nBut my experience has convinced me that an official residence with\r\nsuitable maintenance should be provided for the Vice-President. Under\r\nthe present system he is not lacking in dignity but he has no fixed\r\nposition. The great office should have a settled and permanent\r\nhabitation and a place, irrespective of the financial ability of its\r\ntemporary occupant. While I was glad to be relieved of the\r\nresponsibility of a public establishment, nevertheless, it is a duty the\r\nsecond officer of the nation should assume. It would be much more in\r\nharmony with our theory of equality if each Vice-President held the same\r\nposition in the Capital City.\r\n\r\nVery much is said and written concerning the amount of dining out that\r\nthe Vice-President does. As the President is not available for social\r\ndinners of course the next officer in rank is much sought after for such\r\noccasions. But like everything else that is sent out of Washington for\r\npublic consumption the reports are exaggerated. Probably the average of\r\nthese dinners during the season does not exceed three a week, and as the\r\nSenate is in session after twelve o’clock each week day, there is no\r\nopportunity for lunches or teas.\r\n\r\nWhen we first went to Washington Mrs. Coolidge and I quite enjoyed the\r\nsocial dinners. As we were always the ranking guests we had the\r\nprivilege of arriving last and leaving first, so that we were usually\r\nhome by ten o’clock. It will be seen that this was far from burdensome.\r\nWe found it a most enjoyable opportunity for getting acquainted and\r\ncould scarcely comprehend how anyone who had the privilege of sitting at\r\na table surrounded by representatives of the Cabinet, the Congress, the\r\nDiplomatic Corps and the Army and Navy would not find it interesting.\r\n\r\nPresiding over the Senate was fascinating to me. That branch of the\r\nCongress has its own methods and traditions which may strike the\r\noutsider as peculiar, but more familiarity with them would disclose that\r\nthey are only what long experience has demonstrated to be the best\r\nmethods of conducting its business. It may seem that debate is endless,\r\nbut there is scarcely a time when it is not informing, and, after all,\r\nthe power to compel due consideration is the distinguishing mark of a\r\ndeliberative body. If the Senate is anything it is a great deliberative\r\nbody and if it is to remain a safeguard of liberty it must remain a\r\ndeliberative body. I was entertained and instructed by the debates.\r\nHowever it may appear in the country, no one can become familiar with\r\nthe inside workings of the Senate without gaining a great respect for\r\nit. The country is safe in its hands.\r\n\r\nAt first I intended to become a student of the Senate rules and I did\r\nlearn much about them, but I soon found that the Senate had but one\r\nfixed rule, subject to exceptions of course, which was to the effect\r\nthat the Senate would do anything it wanted to do whenever it wanted to\r\ndo it. When I had learned that, I did not waste much time on the other\r\nrules, because they were so seldom applied. The assistant to the\r\nSecretary of the Senate could be relied on to keep me informed on other\r\nparliamentary questions. But the President of the Senate can and does\r\nexercise a good deal of influence over its deliberations. The\r\nConstitution gives him the power to preside, which is the power to\r\nrecognize whom he will. That often means that he decides what business\r\nis to be taken up and who is to have the floor for debate at any\r\nspecific time.\r\n\r\nNor is the impression that it is a dilatory body never arriving at\r\ndecisions correct. In addition to acting on the thousands of\r\nnominations, and the numerous treaties, it passes much more legislation\r\nthan the House. But it is true that unanimous consent is often required\r\nto close debate, and because of the great power each Senator is\r\ntherefore permitted to exercise--which is often a veto power, making one\r\nSenator a majority of the ninety-six Senators--great care should be\r\nexercised by the states in their choice of Senators. Nothing is more\r\ndangerous to good government than great power in improper hands. If the\r\nSenate has any weakness it is because the people have sent to that body\r\nmen lacking the necessary ability and character to perform the proper\r\nfunctions. But this is not the fault of the Senate. It cannot choose its\r\nown members but has to work with what is sent to it. The fault lies back\r\nin the citizenship of the states. If the Senate does not function\r\nproperly the blame is chiefly on them.\r\n\r\nIf the Vice-President is a man of discretion and character, so that he\r\ncan be relied upon to act as a subordinate in such position, he should\r\nbe invited to sit with the Cabinet, although some of the Senators,\r\nwishing to be the only advisers of the President, do not look on that\r\nproposal with favor. He may not help much in its deliberations, and only\r\non rare occasions would he be a useful contact with the Congress,\r\nalthough his advice on the sentiment of the Senate is of much value,\r\nbut he should be in the Cabinet because he might become President and\r\nought to be informed on the policies of the administration. He will not\r\nlearn of all of them. Much went on in the departments under President\r\nHarding, as it did under me, of which the Cabinet had no knowledge. But\r\nhe will hear much and learn how to find out more if it ever becomes\r\nnecessary. My experience in the Cabinet was of supreme value to me when\r\nI became President.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention when I became Vice-President to remain in\r\nWashington, avoid speaking and attend to the work of my office. But the\r\npressure to speak is constant and intolerable. However, I resisted most\r\nof it. I was honored by the President by his request to make the\r\ndedicatory address at the unveiling of a bust of him in the McKinley\r\nMemorial at Niles, Ohio. I also delivered the address at the dedication\r\nof the Grant statue in Washington.\r\n\r\nDuring these two years I spoke some and lectured some. This took me\r\nabout the country in travels that reached from Maine to California, from\r\nthe Twin Cities to Charleston. I was getting acquainted. Aside from\r\nspeeches I did little writing, but I read a great deal and listened\r\nmuch. While I little realized it at the time it was for me a period of\r\nmost important preparation. It enabled me to be ready in August, 1923.\r\n\r\nAn extra session of the Congress began in April of 1921, which was\r\nalmost continuous until March 4, 1923. While an enormous amount of work\r\nwas done it soon became apparent that the country expected too much from\r\nthe change in administration. The government could and did stop the\r\nwaste of the people’s savings, but it could not restore them. That had\r\nto be done by the hard work and thrift of the people themselves. This\r\nwould take time.\r\n\r\nWhile the country was improving it was still depressed. There was some\r\nunemployment and a good deal of distress in agriculture because of the\r\nvery low prices of farm produce and the shrinkage in land values. When I\r\nbegan to make political speeches in the campaign of 1922 I soon realized\r\nthat the country had large sections that were disappointed because a\r\nreturn of prosperity had not been instantaneous. Moreover the people had\r\nlittle knowledge of the great mass of legislation already accomplished,\r\nwhich was to prove so beneficial to them within a few months in the\r\nfuture. After I had related some of the record of the relief measures\r\nadopted they would come to me to say they had never heard of it and\r\nthought nothing had been done. While my party still held both the House\r\nand Senate it lost many seats in the election, which made the closing\r\nsession of Congress full of complaints tinged with bitterness against an\r\nadministration under which many of them had been defeated. That being\r\nthe natural reaction it is useless to discuss its propriety.\r\n\r\nWhile these years in Washington had been full of interest they were not\r\nwithout some difficulties. Its official circles never accept any one\r\ngladly. There is always a certain unexpressed sentiment that a new\r\narrival is appropriating the power that should rightfully belong to\r\nthem. He is always regarded as in the nature of a usurper. But I think I\r\nmet less of this sentiment than is usual, for I was careful not to be\r\nobtrusive. Nevertheless I could not escape being looked on as one who\r\nmight be given something that others wished to have. But as it soon\r\nbecame apparent that I was wholly engaged in promoting the work of the\r\nSenate and the success of the administration, rather than my own\r\ninterests, I was more cordially accepted.\r\n\r\nIn these two years I witnessed the gigantic task of demobilizing a war\r\ngovernment and restoring it to a peace-time basis. I also came in\r\ncontact with many of the important people of the United States and\r\nforeign countries. All talent eventually arrives at Washington. Most of\r\nthe world figures were there at the Conference on Limitation of\r\nArmaments. Other meetings brought people only a little less\r\ndistinguished. While I had little official connection with these events\r\nthe delegates called on me and I often met them on social occasions.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of President Harding to restore the country became familiar\r\nto me. I saw the steady increase of the wise leadership of Mr. Hughes\r\nand Mr. Mellon in the administration of the government and the passing\r\nof some of the veteran figures of the Senate. Chief among these was\r\nSenator Knox of Pennsylvania. He was a great power and had a control of\r\nthe conduct of the business of the Senate, which he exercised in behalf\r\nof our party policies, that no one else approached during my service in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1923 President Harding was far from well. At his\r\nrequest I took his place in delivering the address at the Budget\r\nMeeting. While he was out again in a few days he never recovered. As\r\nMrs. Coolidge and I were leaving for the long recess on the fourth of\r\nMarch I bade him goodbye. We went to Virginia Hot Springs for a few days\r\nand then returned to Massachusetts, where we remained while I filled\r\nsome speaking engagements, and in July went to Vermont. We left the\r\nPresident and Mrs. Harding in Washington. I do not know what had\r\nimpaired his health. I do know that the weight of the Presidency is very\r\nheavy. Later it was disclosed that he had discovered that some whom he\r\nhad trusted had betrayed him and he had been forced to call them to\r\naccount. It is known that this discovery was a very heavy grief to him,\r\nperhaps more than he could bear. I never saw him again. In June he\r\nstarted for Alaska and--eternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON ENTERING AND LEAVING THE PRESIDENCY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER FIVE_\r\n\r\nON ENTERING AND LEAVING THE PRESIDENCY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a very old saying that you never can tell what you can do until\r\nyou try. The more I see of life the more I am convinced of the wisdom of\r\nthat observation.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly few men are lacking in capacity, but they fail because they\r\nare lacking in application. Either they never learn how to work, or,\r\nhaving learned, they are too indolent to apply themselves with the\r\nseriousness and the attention that is necessary to solve important\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nAny reward that is worth having only comes to the industrious. The\r\nsuccess which is made in any walk of life is measured almost exactly by\r\nthe amount of hard work that is put into it.\r\n\r\nIt has undoubtedly been the lot of every native boy of the United States\r\nto be told that he will some day be President. Nearly every young man\r\nwho happens to be elected a member of his state legislature is pointed\r\nto by his friends and his local newspaper as on the way to the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMy own experience in this respect did not differ from that of others.\r\nBut I never took such suggestions seriously, as I was convinced in my\r\nown mind that I was not qualified to fill the exalted office of\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nI had not changed this opinion after the November elections of 1919,\r\nwhen I was chosen Governor of Massachusetts for a second term by a\r\nmajority which had only been exceeded in 1896.\r\n\r\nWhen I began to be seriously mentioned by some of my friends at that\r\ntime as the Republican candidate for President, it became apparent that\r\nthere were many others who shared the same opinion as to my fitness\r\nwhich I had so long entertained.\r\n\r\nBut the coming national convention, acting in accordance with an\r\nunchangeable determination, took my destiny into its own hands and\r\nnominated me for Vice-President.\r\n\r\nHad I been chosen for the first place, I could have accepted it only\r\nwith a great deal of trepidation, but when the events of August, 1923,\r\nbestowed upon me the Presidential office, I felt at once that power had\r\nbeen given me to administer it. This was not any feeling of\r\nexclusiveness. While I felt qualified to serve, I was also well aware\r\nthat there were many others who were better qualified. It would be my\r\nprovince to get the benefit of their opinions and advice. It is a great\r\nadvantage to a President, and a major source of safety to the country,\r\nfor him to know that he is not a great man. When a man begins to feel\r\nthat he is the only one who can lead in this republic, he is guilty of\r\ntreason to the spirit of our institutions.\r\n\r\nAfter President Harding was seriously stricken, although I noticed that\r\nsome of the newspapers at once sent representatives to be near me at the\r\nhome of my father in Plymouth, Vermont, the official reports which I\r\nreceived from his bedside soon became so reassuring that I believed all\r\ndanger past.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 2, 1923, I was awakened by my father coming up\r\nthe stairs calling my name. I noticed that his voice trembled. As the\r\nonly times I had ever observed that before were when death had visited\r\nour family, I knew that something of the gravest nature had occurred.\r\n\r\nHis emotion was partly due to the knowledge that a man whom he had met\r\nand liked was gone, partly to the feeling that must possess all of our\r\ncitizens when the life of their President is taken from them.\r\n\r\nBut he must have been moved also by the thought of the many sacrifices\r\nhe had made to place me where I was, the twenty-five-mile drives in\r\nstorms and in zero weather over our mountain roads to carry me to the\r\nacademy and all the tenderness and care he had lavished upon me in the\r\nthirty-eight years since the death of my mother in the hope that I might\r\nsometime rise to a position of importance, which he now saw realized.\r\n\r\nHe had been the first to address me as President of the United States.\r\nIt was the culmination of the lifelong desire of a father for the\r\nsuccess of his son.\r\n\r\nHe placed in my hands an official report and told me that President\r\nHarding had just passed away. My wife and I at once dressed.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the room I knelt down and, with the same prayer with\r\nwhich I have since approached the altar of the church, asked God to\r\nbless the American people and give me power to serve them.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was to express my sympathy for those who had been\r\nbereaved and after that was done to attempt to reassure the country with\r\nthe knowledge that I proposed no sweeping displacement of the men then\r\nin office and that there were to be no violent changes in the\r\nadministration of affairs. As soon as I had dispatched a telegram to\r\nMrs. Harding, I therefore issued a short public statement declaratory of\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nMeantime, I had been examining the Constitution to determine what might\r\nbe necessary for qualifying by taking the oath of office. It is not\r\nclear that any additional oath is required beyond what is taken by the\r\nVice-President when he is sworn into office. It is the same form as that\r\ntaken by the President.\r\n\r\nHaving found this form in the Constitution I had it set up on the\r\ntypewriter and the oath was administered by my father in his capacity as\r\na notary public, an office he had held for a great many years.\r\n\r\nThe oath was taken in what we always called the sitting room by the\r\nlight of the kerosene lamp, which was the most modern form of lighting\r\nthat had then reached the neighborhood. The Bible which had belonged to\r\nmy mother lay on the table at my hand. It was not officially used, as it\r\nis not the practice in Vermont or Massachusetts to use a Bible in\r\nconnection with the administration of an oath.\r\n\r\nBesides my father and myself, there were present my wife, Senator Dale,\r\nwho happened to be stopping a few miles away, my stenographer, and my\r\nchauffeur.\r\n\r\nThe picture of this scene has been painted with historical accuracy by\r\nan artist named Keller, who went to Plymouth for that purpose. Although\r\nthe likenesses are not good, everything in relation to the painting is\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nWhere succession to the highest office in the land is by inheritance or\r\nappointment, no doubt there have been kings who have participated in the\r\ninduction of their sons into their office, but in republics where the\r\nsuccession comes by an election I do not know of any other case in\r\nhistory where a father has administered to his son the qualifying oath\r\nof office which made him the chief magistrate of a nation. It seemed a\r\nsimple and natural thing to do at the time, but I can now realize\r\nsomething of the dramatic force of the event.\r\n\r\nThis room was one which was already filled with sacred memories for me.\r\nIn it my sister and my stepmother passed their last hours. It was\r\nassociated with my boyhood recollections of my own mother, who sat and\r\nreclined there during her long invalid years, though she passed away in\r\nan adjoining room where my father was to follow her within three years\r\nfrom this eventful night.\r\n\r\nWhen I started for Washington that morning I turned aside from the main\r\nroad to make a short devotional visit to the grave of my mother. It had\r\nbeen a comfort to me during my boyhood when I was troubled to be near\r\nher last resting place, even in the dead of night. Some way, that\r\nmorning, she seemed very near to me.\r\n\r\nA telegram was sent to my pastor, Dr. Jason Noble Pierce, to meet me on\r\nmy arrival at Washington that evening, which he did.\r\n\r\nI found the Cabinet mostly scattered. Some members had been with the\r\nlate President and some were in Europe. The Secretary of State, Mr.\r\nHughes, and myself, at once began the preparation of plans for the\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nI issued the usual proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe Washington services were held in the rotunda of the Capitol,\r\nfollowed by a simple service and interment at Marion, Ohio, which I\r\nattended with the Cabinet and a large number of officers of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe nation was grief-stricken. Especially noticeable was the deep\r\nsympathy every one felt for Mrs. Harding. Through all this distressing\r\nperiod her bearing won universal commendation. Her attitude of sympathy\r\nand affection towards Mrs. Coolidge and myself was an especial\r\nconsolation to us.\r\n\r\nThe first Sunday after reaching Washington we attended services, as we\r\nwere accustomed to do, at the First Congregational Church. Although I\r\nhad been rather constant in my attendance, I had never joined the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nWhile there had been religious services, there was no organized church\r\nsociety near my boyhood home. Among other things, I had some fear as to\r\nmy ability to set that example which I always felt ought to denote the\r\nlife of a church member. I am inclined to think now that this was a\r\ncounsel of darkness.\r\n\r\nThis first service happened to come on communion day. Our pastor, Dr.\r\nPierce, occupied the pulpit, and, as he can under the practice of the\r\nCongregational Church, and always does, because of his own very tolerant\r\nattitude, he invited all those who believed in the Christian faith,\r\nwhether church members or not, to join in partaking of the communion.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I accepted this invitation, which I later learned he\r\nhad observed, and in a few days without any intimation to me that it was\r\nto be done, considering this to be a sufficient public profession of my\r\nfaith, the church voted me into its membership.\r\n\r\nThis declaration of their belief in me was a great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHad I been approached in the usual way to join the church after I became\r\nPresident, I should have feared that such action might appear to be a\r\npose, and should have hesitated to accept. From what might have been a\r\nmisguided conception I was thus saved by some influence which I had not\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nBut if I had not voluntarily gone to church and partaken of communion,\r\nthis blessing would not have come to me.\r\n\r\nFate bestows its rewards on those who put themselves in the proper\r\nattitude to receive them.\r\n\r\nDuring my service in Washington I had seen a large amount of government\r\nbusiness. Peace had been made with the Central Powers, the tariff\r\nrevised, the budget system adopted, taxation reduced, large payments\r\nmade on the national debt, the Veterans’ Bureau organized, important\r\nfarm legislation passed, public expenditures greatly decreased, the\r\ndifferences with Colombia of twenty years’ standing composed, and the\r\nWashington Conference had reached an epoch-making agreement for the\r\npractical limitation of naval armaments.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find two years of peace-time history in all the\r\nrecord of our republic that were marked with more important and\r\nfar-reaching accomplishments. From my position as President of the\r\nSenate, and in my attendance upon the sessions of the Cabinet, I thus\r\ncame into possession of a very wide knowledge of the details of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the remarkable record which had already been made, much\r\nremained to be done. While anything that relates to the functions of the\r\ngovernment is of enormous interest to me, its economic relations have\r\nalways had a peculiar fascination for me.\r\n\r\nThough these are necessarily predicated on order and peace, yet our\r\npeople are so thoroughly law-abiding and our foreign relations are so\r\nhappy that the problem of government action which is to carry its\r\nbenefits into the homes of all the people becomes almost entirely\r\nconfined to the realm of economics.\r\n\r\nMy personal experience with business had been such as comes to a country\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\nMy official experience with government business had been of a wide\r\nrange. As Mayor, I had charge of the financial affairs of the City of\r\nNorthampton. As Lieutenant-Governor, I was Chairman of the Committee on\r\nFinance of the Governor’s Council, which had to authorize every cent of\r\nthe expenditures of the Commonwealth before they could be made. As\r\nGovernor, I was chargeable with responsibility both for appropriations\r\nand for expenditures.\r\n\r\nMy fundamental idea of both private and public business came first from\r\nmy father. He had the strong New England trait of great repugnance at\r\nseeing anything wasted. He was a generous and charitable man, but he\r\nregarded waste as a moral wrong.\r\n\r\nWealth comes from industry and from the hard experience of human toil.\r\nTo dissipate it in waste and extravagance is disloyalty to humanity.\r\nThis is by no means a doctrine of parsimony. Both men and nations should\r\nlive in accordance with their means and devote their substance not only\r\nto productive industry, but to the creation of the various forms of\r\nbeauty and the pursuit of culture which give adornments to the art of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhen I became President it was perfectly apparent that the key by which\r\nthe way could be opened to national progress was constructive economy.\r\nOnly by the use of that policy could the high rates of taxation, which\r\nwere retarding our development and prosperity, be diminished, and the\r\nenormous burden of our public debt be reduced.\r\n\r\nWithout impairing the efficient operation of all the functions of the\r\ngovernment, I have steadily and without ceasing pressed on in that\r\ndirection. This policy has encouraged enterprise, made possible the\r\nhighest rate of wages which has ever existed, returned large profits,\r\nbrought to the homes of the people the greatest economic benefits they\r\never enjoyed, and given to the country as a whole an unexampled era of\r\nprosperity. This well-being of my country has given me the chief\r\nsatisfaction of my administration.\r\n\r\nOne of my most pleasant memories will be the friendly relations which I\r\nhave always had with the representatives of the press in Washington. I\r\nshall always remember that at the conclusion of the first regular\r\nconference I held with them at the White House office they broke into\r\nhearty applause.\r\n\r\nI suppose that in answering their questions I had been fortunate enough\r\nto tell them what they wanted to know in such a way that they could make\r\nuse of it.\r\n\r\nWhile there have been newspapers which supported me, of course there\r\nhave been others which opposed me, but they have usually been fair. I\r\nshall always consider it the highest tribute to my administration that\r\nthe opposition have based so little of their criticism on what I have\r\nreally said and done.\r\n\r\nI have often said that there was no cause for feeling disturbed at being\r\nmisrepresented in the press. It would be only when they began to say\r\nthings detrimental to me which were true that I should feel alarm.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the reasons I have been a target for so little abuse is\r\nbecause I have tried to refrain from abusing other people.\r\n\r\nThe words of the President have an enormous weight and ought not to be\r\nused indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nIt would be exceedingly easy to set the country all by the ears and\r\nfoment hatreds and jealousies, which, by destroying faith and\r\nconfidence, would help nobody and harm everybody. The end would be the\r\ndestruction of all progress.\r\n\r\nWhile every one knows that evils exist, there is yet sufficient good in\r\nthe people to supply material for most of the comment that needs to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe only way I know to drive out evil from the country is by the\r\nconstructive method of filling it with good. The country is better off\r\ntranquilly considering its blessings and merits, and earnestly striving\r\nto secure more of them, than it would be in nursing hostile bitterness\r\nabout its deficiencies and faults.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the broad general knowledge which I had of the\r\ngovernment, when I reached Washington I found it necessary to make an\r\nextensive survey of the various Departments to acquaint myself with\r\ndetails. This work had to be done intensively from the first of August\r\nto the middle of November, in order to have the background and knowledge\r\nwhich would enable me to discuss the state of the Union in my first\r\nMessage to the Congress.\r\n\r\nAlthough meantime I was pressed with invitations to make speeches, I did\r\nnot accept any of them. The country was in mourning and I felt it more\r\nappropriate to make my first declaration in my Message to the Congress.\r\nOf course, I opened the Red Cross Convention in October, which was an\r\nofficial function for me as its President.\r\n\r\nI was especially fortunate in securing C. Bascom Slemp as my Secretary,\r\nwho had been a member of the House for many years and had a wide\r\nacquaintance with public men and the workings of legislative machinery.\r\nHis advice was most helpful. I had already served with all the members\r\nof the Cabinet, which perhaps was one reason I found them so\r\nsympathetic.\r\n\r\nAmong its membership were men of great ability who have served their\r\ncountry with a capacity which I do not believe was ever exceeded by any\r\nformer Cabinet officers.\r\n\r\nA large amount was learned from George Harvey, Ambassador to England,\r\nconcerning the European situation. He not only had a special aptitude\r\nfor gathering and digesting information of that nature, but had been\r\nlocated at London for two years, where most of it centered.\r\n\r\nI called in a great many people from all the different walks of life\r\nover the country. Among the first to come voluntarily were the veteran\r\nPresident and the Secretary of the American Federation of Labor, Mr.\r\nGompers and Mr. Morrison. They brought a formal resolution expressive of\r\npersonal regard for me and assurance of loyal support for the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nFarm organizations and business men, publishers, educators, and many\r\nothers--all had to be consulted.\r\n\r\nIt has been my policy to seek information and advice wherever I could\r\nfind it. I have never relied on any particular person to be my\r\nunofficial adviser. I have let the merits of each case and the soundness\r\nof all advice speak for themselves. My counselors have been those\r\nprovided by the Constitution and the law.\r\n\r\nDue largely to this careful preparation, my Message was well received.\r\nNo other public utterance of mine had been given greater approbation.\r\n\r\nMost of the praise was sincere. But there were some quarters in the\r\nopposing party where it was thought it would be good strategy to\r\nencourage my party to nominate me, thinking that it would be easy to\r\naccomplish my defeat. I do not know whether their judgment was wrong or\r\nwhether they overdid the operation, so that when they stopped speaking\r\nin my praise they found they could not change the opinion of the people\r\nwhich they had helped to create.\r\n\r\nI have seen a great many attempts at political strategy in my day and\r\nelaborate plans made to encompass the destruction of this or that public\r\nman. I cannot now think of any that did not react with overwhelming\r\nforce upon the perpetrators, sometimes destroying them and sometimes\r\ngiving their proposed victim an opportunity to demonstrate his courage,\r\nstrength and soundness, which increased his standing with the people and\r\nraised him to higher office.\r\n\r\nThere is only one form of political strategy in which I have any\r\nconfidence, and that is to try to do the right thing and sometimes be\r\nable to succeed.\r\n\r\nMany people at once began to speak about nominating me to lead my party\r\nin the next campaign. I did not take any position in relation to their\r\nefforts. Unless the nomination came to me in a natural way, rather than\r\nas the result of an artificial campaign, I did not feel it would be of\r\nany value.\r\n\r\nThe people ought to make their choice on a great question of that kind\r\nwithout the influence that could be exerted by a President in office.\r\n\r\nAfter the favorable reception which was given to my Message, I stated\r\nat the Gridiron Dinner that I should be willing to be a candidate. The\r\nconvention nominated me the next June by a vote which was practically\r\nunanimous.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the occasion of my notification, I did not attend\r\nany partisan meetings or make any purely political speeches during the\r\ncampaign. I spoke several times at the dedication of a monument, the\r\nobservance of the anniversary of an historic event, at a meeting of some\r\ncommercial body, or before some religious gathering. The campaign was\r\nmagnificently managed by William M. Butler and as it progressed the\r\nfinal result became more and more apparent.\r\n\r\nMy own participation was delayed by the death of my son Calvin, which\r\noccurred on the seventh of July. He was a boy of much promise,\r\nproficient in his studies, with a scholarly mind, who had just turned\r\nsixteen.\r\n\r\nHe had a remarkable insight into things.\r\n\r\nThe day I became President he had just started to work in a tobacco\r\nfield. When one of his fellow laborers said to him, “If my father was\r\nPresident I would not work in a tobacco field,” Calvin replied, “If my\r\nfather were your father, you would.”\r\n\r\nAfter he was gone some one sent us a letter he had written about the\r\nsame time to a young man who had congratulated him on being the first\r\nboy in the land. To this he had replied that he had done nothing, and so\r\ndid not merit the title, which should go to “some boy who had\r\ndistinguished himself through his own actions.”\r\n\r\nWe do not know what might have happened to him under other\r\ncircumstances, but if I had not been President he would not have raised\r\na blister on his toe, which resulted in blood poisoning, playing lawn\r\ntennis in the South Grounds.\r\n\r\nIn his suffering he was asking me to make him well. I could not.\r\n\r\nWhen he went the power and the glory of the Presidency went with him.\r\n\r\nThe ways of Providence are often beyond our understanding. It seemed to\r\nme that the world had need of the work that it was probable he could do.\r\n\r\nI do not know why such a price was exacted for occupying the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRACE GOODHUE\r\n\r\n_Before her marriage to Calvin Coolidge_]\r\n\r\nSustained by the great outpouring of sympathy from all over the nation,\r\nmy wife and I bowed to the Supreme Will and with such courage as we had\r\nwent on in the discharge of our duties.\r\n\r\nIn less than two years my father followed him.\r\n\r\nAt his advanced age he had overtaxed his strength receiving the\r\nthousands of visitors who went to my old home at Plymouth. It was all a\r\ngreat satisfaction to him and he would not have had it otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen I was there and visitors were kept from the house for a short\r\nperiod, he would be really distressed in the thought that they could not\r\nsee all they wished and he would go out where they were himself and\r\nmingle among them.\r\n\r\nI knew for some weeks that he was passing his last days. I sent to bring\r\nhim to Washington, but he clung to his old home.\r\n\r\nIt was a sore trial not to be able to be with him, but I had to leave\r\nhim where he most wished to be. When his doctors advised me that he\r\ncould survive only a short time I started to visit him, but he sank to\r\nrest while I was on my way.\r\n\r\nFor my personal contact with him during his last months I had to resort\r\nto the poor substitute of the telephone. When I reached home he was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nIt costs a great deal to be President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OF THE DUTIES OF\r\nTHE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER SIX_\r\n\r\nSOME OF THE DUTIES OF THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I recall the mounting events of the years I spent in Washington, I\r\nappreciate how impossible it is to convey an adequate realization of the\r\noffice of President. A few short paragraphs in the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States describe all his fundamental duties. Various laws passed\r\nover a period of nearly a century and a half have supplemented his\r\nauthority. All of his actions can be analyzed. All of his goings and\r\ncomings can be recited. The details of his daily life can be made known.\r\nThe effect of his policies on his own country and on the world at large\r\ncan be estimated. His methods of work, his associates, his place of\r\nabode, can all be described. But the relationship created by all these\r\nand more, which constitutes the magnitude of the office, does not yield\r\nto definition. Like the glory of a morning sunrise, it can only be\r\nexperienced--it can not be told.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of the duties of the office there is one rule of action\r\nmore important than all others. It consists in never doing anything that\r\nsome one else can do for you. Like many other good rules, it is proven\r\nby its exceptions. But it indicates a course that should be very\r\nstrictly followed in order to prevent being so entirely devoted to\r\ntrifling details that there will be little opportunity to give the\r\nnecessary consideration to policies of larger importance.\r\n\r\nLike some other rules, this one has an important corollary which must be\r\ncarefully observed in order to secure success. It is not sufficient to\r\nentrust details to some one else. They must be entrusted to some one who\r\nis competent. The Presidency is primarily an executive office. It is\r\nplaced at the apex of our system of government. It is a place of last\r\nresort to which all questions are brought that others have not been able\r\nto answer. The ideal way for it to function is to assign to the various\r\npositions men of sufficient ability so that they can solve all the\r\nproblems that arise under their jurisdiction. If there is a troublesome\r\nsituation in Nicaragua, a General McCoy can manage it. If we have\r\ndifferences with Mexico, a Morrow can compose them. If there is unrest\r\nin the Philippines, a Stimson can quiet them. About a dozen able,\r\ncourageous, reliable and experienced men in the House and the Senate can\r\nreduce the problem of legislation almost to a vanishing point.\r\n\r\nWhile it is wise for the President to get all the competent advice\r\npossible, final judgments are necessarily his own. No one can share with\r\nhim the responsibility for them. No one can make his decisions for him.\r\nHe stands at the center of things where no one else can stand. If others\r\nmake mistakes, they can be relieved, and oftentimes a remedy can be\r\nprovided. But he can not retire. His decisions are final and usually\r\nirreparable. This constitutes the appalling burden of his office. Not\r\nonly the welfare of 120,000,000 of his countrymen, but oftentimes the\r\npeaceful relations of the world are entrusted to his keeping. At the\r\nturn of his hand the guns of an enormous fleet would go into action\r\nanywhere in the world, carrying the iron might of death and destruction.\r\nHis appointment confers the power to administer justice, inflict\r\ncriminal penalties, declare acts of state legislatures and of the\r\nCongress void, and sit in judgment over the very life of the nation.\r\nPractically all the civil and military authorities of the government,\r\nexcept the Congress and the courts, hold their office at his discretion.\r\nHe appoints, and he can remove. The billions of dollars of government\r\nrevenue are collected and expended under his direction. The Congress\r\nmakes the laws, but it is the President who causes them to be executed.\r\nA power so vast in its implications has never been conferred upon any\r\nruling sovereign.\r\n\r\nYet the President exercises his authority in accordance with the\r\nConstitution and the law. He is truly the agent of the people,\r\nperforming such functions as they have entrusted to him. The\r\nConstitution specifically vests him with the executive power. Some\r\nPresidents have seemed to interpret that as an authorization to take any\r\naction which the Constitution, or perhaps the law, does not specifically\r\nprohibit. Others have considered that their powers extended only to such\r\nacts as were specifically authorized by the Constitution and the\r\nstatutes. This has always seemed to me to be a hypothetical question,\r\nwhich it would be idle to attempt to determine in advance. It would\r\nappear to be the better practice to wait to decide each question on its\r\nmerits as it arises. Jefferson is said to have entertained the opinion\r\nthat there was no constitutional warrant for enlarging the territory of\r\nthe United States, but when the actual facts confronted him he did not\r\nhesitate to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase. For all ordinary occasions\r\nthe specific powers assigned to the President will be found sufficient\r\nto provide for the welfare of the country. That is all he needs.\r\n\r\nAll situations that arise are likely to be simplified, and many of them\r\ncompletely solved, by an application of the Constitution and the law. If\r\nwhat they require to be done, is done, there is no opportunity for\r\ncriticism, and it would be seldom that anything better could be devised.\r\nA Commission once came to me with a proposal for adopting rules to\r\nregulate the conduct of its members. As they were evenly divided, each\r\nside wished me to decide against the other. They did this because, while\r\nit is always the nature of a Commissioner to claim that he is entirely\r\nindependent of the President, he would usually welcome Presidential\r\ninterference with any other Commissioner who does not agree with him.\r\nIn this case it occurred to me that the Department of Justice should\r\nascertain what the statute setting up this Commission required under the\r\ncircumstances. A reference to the law disclosed that the Congress had\r\nspecified the qualifications of the members of the Commission and that\r\nthey could not by rule either enlarge or diminish the power of their\r\nindividual members. So their problem was solved like many others by\r\nsimply finding out what the law required.\r\n\r\nEvery day of the Presidential life is crowded with activities. When\r\npeople not accustomed to Washington came to the office, or when I met\r\nthem on some special occasion, they often remarked that it seemed to be\r\nmy busy day, to which my stock reply came to be that all days were busy\r\nand there was little difference among them. It was my custom to be out\r\nof bed about six-thirty, except in the darkest mornings of winter. One\r\nof the doormen at the White House was an excellent barber, but I always\r\npreferred to shave myself with old-fashioned razors, which I knew how to\r\nkeep in good condition. It was my intention to take a short walk before\r\nbreakfast, which Mrs. Coolidge and I ate together in our rooms. For me\r\nthere was fruit and about one-half cup of coffee, with a home-made\r\ncereal made from boiling together two parts of unground wheat with one\r\npart of rye. To this was added a roll and a strip of bacon, which went\r\nmostly to our dogs.\r\n\r\nSoon after eight found me dictating in the White House library in\r\npreparation for some public utterance. This would go on for more than an\r\nhour, after which I began to receive callers at the office. Most of\r\nthese came by appointment, but in addition to the average of six to\r\neight who were listed there would be as many more from my Cabinet and\r\nthe Congress, to whom I was always accessible. Each one came to me with\r\na different problem requiring my decision, which was usually made at\r\nonce. About twelve-fifteen those began to be brought in who were to be\r\nsomewhat formally presented. At twelve-thirty the doors were opened, and\r\na long line passed by who wished merely to shake hands with the\r\nPresident. On one occasion I shook hands with nineteen hundred in\r\nthirty-four minutes, which is probably my record. Instead of a burden,\r\nit was a pleasure and a relief to meet people in that way and listen to\r\ntheir greeting, which was often a benediction. It was at this same hour\r\nthat the numerous groups assembled in the South Grounds, where I joined\r\nthem for the photographs used for news purposes and permanent mementoes\r\nof their White House visit.\r\n\r\nLunch came at one o’clock, at which we usually had guests. It made an\r\nopportunity for giving our friends a little more attention than could be\r\nextended through a mere handshake. About an hour was devoted to rest\r\nbefore returning to the office, where the afternoon was reserved for\r\nattention to the immense number of documents which pass over the desk of\r\nthe President. These were all cleaned up each day. Before dinner another\r\nwalk was in order, followed by exercises on some of the vibrating\r\nmachines kept in my room. We gathered at the dinner table at seven\r\no’clock and within three-quarters of an hour work would be resumed with\r\nmy stenographer to continue until about ten o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe White House offices are under the direction of the Secretary to the\r\nPresident. They are the center of activities which are world-wide.\r\nReports come in daily from heads of departments, from distant\r\npossessions, and from foreign diplomats and consular agents scattered\r\nall over the earth. A mass of correspondence, from the Congress, the\r\nofficials of the states, and the general public, is constantly being\r\nreceived. All of this often reaches two thousand pieces in a day. Very\r\nmuch of it is sent at once to the Department to which it refers, from\r\nwhich an answer is sent direct to the writer. Other parts are sent to\r\ndifferent members of the office staff; and some is laid before the\r\nPresident. While I signed many letters, I did not dictate many. After\r\nindicating the nature of the reply, it was usually put into form by some\r\nof the secretaries. A great many photographs were sent in to be\r\ninscribed, and a constant stream of autographs went to all who wrote for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt ten-thirty on Tuesdays and Fridays the Cabinet meetings were held.\r\nThese were always very informal. Each member was asked if he had any\r\nproblem he wished to lay before the President. When I first attended\r\nwith President Harding at the beginning of a new administration these\r\nwere rather numerous. Later, they decreased, as each member felt better\r\nable to solve his own problems. After entire freedom of discussion, but\r\nalways without a vote of any kind, I was accustomed to announce what the\r\ndecision should be. There never ought to be and never were marked\r\ndifferences of opinion in my Cabinet. As their duties were not to advise\r\neach other, but to advise the President, they could not disagree among\r\nthemselves. I rarely failed to accept their recommendations. Sometimes\r\nthey wished for larger appropriations than the state of the Treasury\r\nwarranted, but they all cooperated most sincerely in the policy of\r\neconomy and were content with such funds as I could assign to them.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State is the agency through which the President\r\nexercises his constitutional authority to deal with foreign relations.\r\nAs this subject is a matter of constant interchange, he makes no annual\r\nreport upon it. Other Cabinet officers make annual reports to the\r\nPresident on the whole conduct of their departments, which he transmits\r\nto the Congress. All the intercourse with foreign governments is carried\r\non through the Secretary of State, and a national of a foreign country\r\ncan not be received by the President unless the accredited diplomatic\r\nrepresentative of his government has made an appointment for him through\r\nthe State Department.\r\n\r\nAll foreign approaches to the President are through this Department.\r\nWhen an Ambassador or Minister is to present his credentials, the\r\nUndersecretary of State brings him to the White House and escorts him to\r\nthe Green Room. After the President has taken his position standing in\r\nthe Blue Room accompanied by his aides, the diplomat is then brought\r\nbefore him. He presents his letters with a short formal statement, to\r\nwhich the President responds in kind. When the mutual expressions of\r\nfriendly interest and good will have been exchanged, the accompanying\r\nstaff of the diplomat is brought in for presentation, after which he\r\nretires. Except when foreign officials are presented for an audience in\r\nthis way, the etiquette of the White House requires that those who are\r\npresent should remain until the President and the Mistress of the White\r\nHouse retire from the room.\r\n\r\nA competent man is assigned from the State Department to have the\r\nmanagement of the White House official social function. He has under\r\nhim a considerable staff located in one of the basement rooms, known as\r\nthe Social Bureau. They keep a careful list of all those who leave cards\r\nand of the officials who should be invited to receptions, which is\r\nconstantly revised to meet changing conditions. While the President has\r\nsupervision over all these functions, the most effective way to deal\r\nwith them is to provide a capable Mistress of the White House. I have\r\noften been complimented on the choice which I made nearly twenty-five\r\nyears ago. These functions were so much in the hands of Mrs. Coolidge\r\nthat oftentimes I did not know what guests were to be present until I\r\nmet them in the Blue Room just before going in to dinner.\r\n\r\nThese social functions are almost as much a part of the life of official\r\nWashington as a session of the Congress or a term of the Supreme Court.\r\nThe season opens with the Cabinet dinner. Following this come the\r\nDiplomatic reception, the Diplomatic dinner, then the Judicial\r\nreception, the Supreme Court dinner, then the Congressional reception\r\nand the Speaker’s dinner, with the last reception of the year tendered\r\nto the Army and Navy. About fifty guests assemble at the dinners, except\r\nthat given to the diplomats, when the presence of the Ambassadors or\r\nMinisters, with their wives, of all countries represented in Washington\r\nbrings the number up to about ninety. The Marine Band is in attendance\r\non all these occasions. Following the dinners a short musical recital by\r\nfamous artists is given in the East Room, to which many additional\r\nguests are invited.\r\n\r\nA reception is a particularly colorful event. About thirty-five hundred\r\ninvitations are issued. When the guests are assembled the President and\r\nhis wife, preceded by his aides and followed by the Cabinet and his\r\nSecretary and their wives, go down the main staircase, pausing for a\r\nmoment to receive the military salute of the band, and then pass to the\r\nBlue Room where the receptions are always held. When the foreign\r\ndiplomats are present in their official dress, the scene is very\r\nbrilliant. After all the presentations have been made, the President and\r\nhis retinue return to the second floor. Immediately after this there is\r\ndancing in the East Room to furnish entertainment while the long line\r\nof cars comes up to take the guests home.\r\n\r\nWhenever the prominent officials of foreign governments visit\r\nWashington, it is customary to receive them at a luncheon or dinner at\r\nthe White House. When the Prince of Wales was here in 1924 we were in\r\nmourning, due to the loss of our son, so that he lunched with us\r\ninformally without any other invited guests. When the Queen of Rumania\r\ncame to Washington she was entertained at dinner. There have also been\r\nPrinces of the reigning house of Japan and of Sweden, the Premier of\r\nFrance, the Governor General of Canada, the Presidents of the Irish Free\r\nState, of Cuba, and of Mexico, who have been received and entertained in\r\nsome manner. Whenever an official gathering of foreigners, like the\r\nPanama Conference, convenes in Washington, the President and the\r\nMistress of the White House tender them a reception and a dinner.\r\n\r\nBesides these formal social gatherings, there were various afternoon\r\nteas and musicales, which I sometimes neglected, and usually one or two\r\ngarden parties held in the South Grounds, one of which was for the\r\ndisabled veterans who were patients in Washington hospitals. These\r\nparties were accompanied with band music and light refreshments, which\r\nalways seemed to be appreciated by the veterans.\r\n\r\nMy personal social functions consisted of the White House breakfasts,\r\nwhich were attended by fifteen to twenty-five members of the House and\r\nSenate and others, who gathered around my table at eight-thirty o’clock\r\nin the morning to partake of a meal which ended with wheat cakes and\r\nVermont maple syrup. During the last session of the Congress I invited\r\nall the members of the Senate, all the chairmen and ranking Democratic\r\nmembers of the committees of the House, and finally had breakfast with\r\nthe officers of both houses of the Congress. Although we did not\r\nundertake to discuss matters of public business at these breakfasts,\r\nthey were productive of a spirit of good fellowship which was no doubt a\r\nhelpful influence to the transaction of public business.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these White House events, the President and his wife go\r\nout to twelve official dinners. They begin with the Vice-President, go\r\non among the ten members of the Cabinet, and close with the Speaker of\r\nthe House. Aside from these, it is not customary for the President to\r\naccept the hospitality of any individuals. This is not from any desire\r\non his part to be exclusive, but rather arises from an application of\r\nthe principle of equality. The number of days in his term of office is\r\nlimited. If he gave up all the time when he is not otherwise necessarily\r\nengaged, it is doubtful if he could find fifty evenings in a year when\r\nhe could accept invitations. At once he would be confronted with the\r\nnecessity of deciding which to accept and which to reject. If he served\r\neight years, he could only touch the fringe of official Washington, even\r\nif he chose to disregard all the balance of the country. The only escape\r\nfrom an otherwise impossible situation is to observe the rule of\r\nrefusing all social invitations.\r\n\r\nThe President stands at the head of all official and social rank in the\r\nnation. As he is Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, all their\r\nofficers are his subordinates. As he is the head of the government, he\r\noutranks all other public officials. As the first citizen, he is placed\r\nat the top of the social scale. Wherever he goes, whenever he appears,\r\nhe must be assigned the place of honor. It follows from this that he can\r\nnot consistently attend a dinner or any other function given by some one\r\nelse in honor of any other person. He can have ceremonies of his own at\r\nthe White House, or outside, in which he recognizes the merit of others\r\nand bestows upon them appropriate honors. But his participation in any\r\nother occasion of such a nature is confined to sending an appropriate\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nIt would make great confusion in all White House relations unless the\r\nrules of procedure were observed. If this were not done, the most\r\nambitious and intruding would seize the place of honor, or it would be\r\nbestowed by favor. In both cases all official position would be ignored.\r\nIn its working out, therefore, the adoption of rules which take no\r\naccount of persons, but simply apply to places, is the only method which\r\nis in harmony with our spirit of equality. In its application it gives\r\nus more completely a government of laws and not of men.\r\n\r\nAs he is head of the government, charged with making appointments, and\r\nclothed with the executive power, the President has a certain\r\nresponsibility for the conduct of all departments, commissions and\r\nindependent bureaus. While I was willing to advise with any of these\r\nofficers and give them any assistance in my power, I always felt they\r\nshould make their own decisions and rarely volunteered any advice. Many\r\napplications are made requesting the President to seek to influence\r\nthese bodies, and such applications were usually transmitted to them for\r\ntheir information without comment. Wherever they exercise judicial\r\nfunctions, I always felt that some impropriety might attach to any\r\nsuggestions from me. The parties before them are entitled to a fair\r\ntrial on the merits of their case and to have judgment rendered by those\r\nto whom both sides have presented their evidence. If some one on the\r\noutside undertook to interfere, even if grave injustice was not done,\r\nthe integrity of a commission which comes from a knowledge that it can\r\nbe relied on to exercise its own independent judgment would be very much\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nI never hesitated to ask commissions to speed up their work and get\r\ntheir business done, but if they were not doing it correctly my remedy\r\nwould be to supplant them with those who I thought would do better. At\r\none time the Shipping Board adopted a resolution declaring their\r\nindependence of the President and claiming they were responsible solely\r\nto the Congress. As I always considered they had a rather impossible\r\ntask, I doubted whether any one could be very successful in its\r\nperformance. If they wished to try to relieve me of its responsibility,\r\nI had no personal objection and would probably be saved from\r\nconsiderable criticism. But they found they could not carry on their\r\nwork without the support of the President, so that some of them resigned\r\nand the remainder reestablished their contact with the White House,\r\nwhich was always open to them.\r\n\r\nThe practice which I followed in my relations with commissions and in\r\nthe recognition of rank has been long established. President Jefferson\r\nseems to have entertained the opinion that even the Supreme Court should\r\nbe influenced by his wishes and that failing in this a recalcitrant\r\njudge should be impeached by a complaisant Congress. This brought him\r\ninto a sharp conflict with John Marshall, who resisted any encroachment\r\nupon the independence of the Court. In this controversy the position of\r\nMarshall has been vindicated. It is also said that at some of his\r\nofficial dinners President Jefferson left all his guests to the\r\nconfusion of taking whatever seat they could find at his table. But this\r\nmethod did not survive the test of history. In spite of all his\r\ngreatness, any one who had as many ideas as Jefferson was bound to find\r\nthat some of them would not work. But this does not detract from the\r\nwisdom of his faith in the people and his constant insistence that they\r\nbe left to manage their own affairs. His opposition to bureaucracy will\r\nbear careful analysis, and the country could stand a great deal more of\r\nits application. The trouble with us is that we talk about Jefferson but\r\ndo not follow him. In his theory that the people should manage their\r\ngovernment, and not be managed by it, he was everlastingly right.\r\n\r\nTradition and custom, it will be seen, are oftentimes determining\r\nfactors in the Presidential office, as they are in all other walks of\r\nlife. This is not because they are arbitrary or artificial, but because\r\nlong experience has demonstrated that they are the best methods of\r\ndealing with human affairs. Things are done in a certain way after many\r\nrepetitions show that way causes the least friction and is most likely\r\nto bring the desired result. While there are times when the people might\r\nenjoy the spectacular, in the end they will only be satisfied with\r\naccomplishments. The President gets the best advice he can find, uses\r\nthe best judgment at his command, and leaves the event in the hands of\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\nEverything that the President does potentially at least is of such great\r\nimportance that he must be constantly on guard. This applies not only to\r\nhimself, but to everybody about him. Not only in all his official\r\nactions, but in all his social intercourse, and even in his recreation\r\nand repose, he is constantly watched by a multitude of eyes to determine\r\nif there is anything unusual, extraordinary, or irregular, which can be\r\nset down in praise or in blame. Oftentimes trifling incidents, some\r\ninsignificant action, an unfortunate phrase in an address, an\r\ninjudicious letter, a lack of patience towards some one who presents an\r\nimpossible proposition, too much attention to one person, or too little\r\ncourtesy towards another, become magnified into the sensation of the\r\nhour. While such events finally sink into their proper place in history\r\nas too small for consideration, if they occur frequently they create an\r\natmosphere of distraction that might seriously interfere with the\r\nconduct of public business which is really important.\r\n\r\nIt was my desire to maintain about the White House as far as possible an\r\nattitude of simplicity and not engage in anything that had an air of\r\npretentious display. That was my conception of the great office. It\r\ncarries sufficient power within itself, so that it does not require any\r\nof the outward trappings of pomp and splendor for the purpose of\r\ncreating an impression. It has a dignity of its own which makes it\r\nself-sufficient. Of course, there should be proper formality, and\r\npersonal relations should be conducted at all times with decorum and\r\ndignity, and in accordance with the best traditions of polite society.\r\nBut there is no need of theatricals.\r\n\r\nBut, however much he may deplore it, the President ceases to be an\r\nordinary citizen. In order to function at all he has to be surrounded\r\nwith many safeguards. If these were removed for only a short time, he\r\nwould be overwhelmed by the people who would surge in upon him. In\r\ntraveling it would be agreeable to me to use the regular trains which\r\nare open to the public. I have done so once or twice. But I found it\r\nmade great difficulty for the railroads. They reported that it was\r\nunsafe, because they could not take the necessary precautions. It\r\ntherefore seemed best to run a second section, following a regular\r\ntrain, for the exclusive use of the President and his party. While the\r\nfacilities of a private car have always been offered, I think they have\r\nonly been used once, when one was needed for the better comfort of Mrs.\r\nCoolidge during her illness. Although I have not been given to much\r\ntravel during my term of office, it has been sufficient, so that I am\r\nconvinced the government should own a private car for the use of the\r\nPresident when he leaves Washington. The pressure on him is so great,\r\nthe responsibilities are so heavy, that it is wise public policy in\r\norder to secure his best services to provide him with such ample\r\nfacilities that he will be relieved as far as possible from all physical\r\ninconveniences.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally understood how much detail is involved in any\r\njourney of the President. One or two secret service men must go to the\r\ndestination several days in advance. His line of travel and every street\r\nand location which he is to visit are carefully examined. The order of\r\nceremonies has to be submitted for approval. Oftentimes the local police\r\nare inadequate, so that it is necessary to use some of the military or\r\nnaval forces to assist them. Not only his aides and his personal\r\nphysician, but also secret service men, some of his office force, and\r\nhouse servants, have to be in attendance. Quarters must also be provided\r\nfor a large retinue of newspaper reporters and camera men who follow him\r\nupon all occasions. Every switch that he goes over is spiked down. Every\r\nfreight train that he passes is stopped and every passenger train slowed\r\ndown to ten miles per hour. While all of this proceeds smoothly, it\r\nrequires careful attention to a great variety of details.\r\n\r\nIt has never been my practice to speak from rear platforms. The\r\nconfusion is so great that few people could hear and it does not seem to\r\nme very dignified. When the President speaks it ought to be an event.\r\nThe excuse for such appearances which formerly existed has been\r\neliminated by the coming of the radio. It is so often that the President\r\nis on the air that almost any one who wishes has ample opportunity to\r\nhear his voice. It has seemed more appropriate for Mrs. Coolidge and me\r\nto appear at the rear of the train where the people could see us. About\r\nthe only time that I have spoken was at Bennington in September of 1928,\r\nwhere I expressed my affection and respect for the people of the state\r\nof Vermont, as I was passing through that town on my way back to\r\nWashington. I found that the love I had for the hills where I was born\r\ntouched a responsive chord in the heart of the whole nation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most appalling trials which confront a President is the\r\nperpetual clamor for public utterances. Invitations are constant and\r\npressing. They come by wire, by mail, and by delegations. No event of\r\nimportance is celebrated anywhere in the United States without inviting\r\nhim to come to deliver an oration. When others are enjoying a holiday,\r\nhe is expected to make a public appearance in order to entertain and\r\ninstruct by a formal address. There are a few public statements that he\r\ndoes not deliver in person, like proclamations, and messages, which go\r\nto the Congress, either reporting his views on the state of the Union in\r\nhis Annual Message or giving his reasons for rejecting legislation in a\r\nveto. These productions vary in length. My Annual Message would be about\r\ntwelve thousand words. My speeches would average a little over three\r\nthousand words. In the course of a year the entire number reaches about\r\ntwenty, which probably represents an output of at least seventy-five\r\nthousand words.\r\n\r\nThis kind of work is very exacting. It requires the most laborious and\r\nextended research and study, and the most careful and painstaking\r\nthought. Each word has to be weighed in the realization that it is a\r\nPresidential utterance which will be dissected at home and abroad to\r\ndiscover its outward meaning and any possible hidden implications.\r\nBefore it is finished it is thoroughly examined by one or two of my\r\nstaff, and oftentimes by a member of the Cabinet. It is not difficult\r\nfor me to deliver an address. The difficulty lies in its preparation.\r\nThis is an important part of the work of a President which he can not\r\nescape. It is inherent in the office.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALVIN COOLIDGE AND HIS FAMILY\r\n\r\n_The day he became Governor of Massachusetts_]\r\n\r\nA great many presents come to the White House, which are all cherished,\r\nnot so much for their intrinsic value as because they are tokens of\r\nesteem and affection. Almost everything that can be eaten comes. We\r\nalways know what to do with that. But some of the pets that are offered\r\nus are more of a problem. I have a beautiful black-haired bear that was\r\nbrought all the way from Mexico in a truck, and a pair of live lion cubs\r\nnow grown up, and a small species of hippopotamus which came from South\r\nAfrica. These and other animals and birds have been placed in the\r\nzoological quarters in Rock Creek Park. We always had more dogs than we\r\ncould take care of. My favorites were the white collies, which became so\r\nmuch associated with me that they are enshrined in my bookplate, where\r\nthey will live as long as our country endures. One of them, Prudence\r\nPrim, was especially attached to Mrs. Coolidge. We lost her in the Black\r\nHills. She lies out there in the shadow of Bear Butte where the Indians\r\ntold me the Great Spirit came to commune with his children. One was my\r\ncompanion, Rob Roy. He was a stately gentleman of great courage and\r\nfidelity. He loved to bark from the second-story windows and around the\r\nSouth Grounds. Nights he remained in my room and afternoons went with me\r\nto the office. His especial delight was to ride with me in the boats\r\nwhen I went fishing. So although I know he would bark for joy as the\r\ngrim boatman ferried him across the dark waters of the Styx, yet his\r\ngoing left me lonely on the hither shore.\r\n\r\nAs I left office I realized that the more I had seen of the workings of\r\nthe Federal government the more respect I came to have for it. It is\r\ncarried on by hundreds of thousands of people. Some prove incompetent. A\r\nvery few are tempted to become disloyal to their trust. But the great\r\nrank and file of them are of good ability, conscientious, and faithful\r\npublic servants. While some are paid more than they would earn in\r\nprivate life, there are great throngs who are serving at a distinct\r\npersonal sacrifice. Among the higher officials this is almost always\r\ntrue. The service they perform entitles them to approbation and honor.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has sometimes been a sore trial to Presidents. I did not\r\nfind it so in my case. Among them were men of wonderful ability and\r\nveteran experience. I think they made their decisions with an honest\r\npurpose to serve their country. The membership of the Senate changed\r\nvery much by reason of those who sacrificed themselves for public duty.\r\nOf all public officials with whom I have ever been acquainted, the work\r\nof a Senator of the United States is by far the most laborious. About\r\ntwenty of them died during the eight years I was in Washington.\r\n\r\nSometimes it would seem for a day that either the House or the Senate\r\nhad taken some unwise action, but if it was not corrected on the floor\r\nwhere it occurred it was usually remedied in the other chamber. I always\r\nfound the members of both parties willing to confer with me and disposed\r\nto treat my recommendations fairly. Most of the differences could be\r\nadjusted by personal discussion. Sometimes I made an appeal direct to\r\nthe country by stating my position at the newspaper conferences. I\r\nadopted that course in relation to the Mississippi Flood Control Bill.\r\nAs it passed the Senate it appeared to be much too extravagant in its\r\nrule of damages and its proposed remedy. The press began a vigorous\r\ndiscussion of the subject, which caused the House greatly to modify the\r\nbill, and in conference a measure that was entirely fair and moderate\r\nwas adopted. On other occasions I appealed to the country more\r\nprivately, enlisting the influence of labor and trade organizations upon\r\nthe Congress in behalf of some measures in which I was interested. That\r\nwas done in the case of the tax bill of 1928. As it passed the House,\r\nthe reductions were so large that the revenue necessary to meet the\r\npublic expenses would not have been furnished. By quietly making this\r\nknown to the Senate, and enlisting support for that position among their\r\nconstituents, it was possible to secure such modification of the measure\r\nthat it could be adopted without greatly endangering the revenue.\r\n\r\nBut a President cannot, with success, constantly appeal to the country.\r\nAfter a time he will get no response. The people have their own affairs\r\nto look after and can not give much attention to what the Congress is\r\ndoing. If he takes a position, and stands by it, ultimately it will be\r\nadopted. Most of the policies set out in my first Annual Message have\r\nbecome law, but it took several years to get action on some of them.\r\n\r\nOne of the most perplexing and at the same time most important functions\r\nof the President is the making of appointments. In some few cases he\r\nacts alone, but usually they are made with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate. It is the practice to consult Senators of his own party before\r\nmaking an appointment from their state. In choosing persons for service\r\nover the whole or any considerable portion of a single state, it is\r\ncustomary to rely almost entirely on the party Senators from that state\r\nfor recommendations. It is not possible to find men who are perfect.\r\nSelection always has to be limited to human beings, whatever choice is\r\nmade. It is therefore always possible to point out defects. The\r\nsupposition that no one should be appointed who has had experience in\r\nthe field which he is to supervise is extremely detrimental to the\r\npublic service. An Interstate Commerce Commissioner is much better\r\nqualified, if he knows something about transportation. A Federal Trade\r\nCommissioner can render much better service if he has had a legal\r\npractice which extended into large business transactions. The assertion\r\nof those who contend that persons accepting a government appointment\r\nwould betray their trust in favor of former associates can be understood\r\nonly on the supposition that those who make it feel that their own\r\ntenure of public office is for the purpose of benefiting themselves and\r\ntheir friends.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that where the treasure is, there will the heart be\r\nalso. When a man has invested his personal interest and reputation in\r\nthe conduct of a public office, if he goes wrong it will not be because\r\nof former relations, but because he is a bad man. The same interests\r\nthat reached him would reach any bad man, irrespective of former life\r\nhistory. What we need in appointive positions is men of knowledge and\r\nexperience who have sufficient character to resist temptations. If that\r\nstandard is maintained, we need not be concerned about their former\r\nactivities. If it is not maintained, all the restrictions on their past\r\nemployment that can be conceived will be of no avail.\r\n\r\nThe more experience I have had in making appointments, the more I am\r\nconvinced that attempts to put limitations on the appointing power are\r\na mistake. It should be possible to choose a well qualified person\r\nwherever he can be found. When restrictions are placed on residence,\r\noccupation, or profession, it almost always happens that some one is\r\nfound who is universally admitted to be the best qualified, but who is\r\neliminated by the artificial specifications. So long as the Senate has\r\nthe power to reject nominations, there is little danger that a President\r\nwould abuse his authority if he were given the largest possible freedom\r\nin his choices. The public service would be improved if all vacancies\r\nwere filled by simply appointing the best ability and character that can\r\nbe found. That is what is done in private business. The adoption of any\r\nother course handicaps the government in all its operations.\r\n\r\nIn determining upon all his actions, however, the President has to\r\nremember that he is dealing with two different minds. One is the mind of\r\nthe country, largely intent upon its own personal affairs, and, while\r\nnot greatly interested in the government, yet desirous of seeing it\r\nconducted in an orderly and dignified manner for the advancement of the\r\npublic welfare. Those who compose this mind wish to have the country\r\nprosperous and are opposed to unjust taxation and public extravagance.\r\nAt the same time they have a patriotic pride which moves them with so\r\ngreat a desire to see things well done that they are willing to pay for\r\nit. They gladly contribute their money to place the United States in the\r\nlead. In general, they represent the public opinion of the land.\r\n\r\nBut they are unorganized, formless, and inarticulate. Against a compact\r\nand well drilled minority they do not appear to be very effective. They\r\nare nevertheless the great power in our government. I have constantly\r\nappealed to them and have seldom failed in enlisting their support. They\r\nare the court of last resort and their decisions are final.\r\n\r\nThey are, however, the indirect rather than the direct power. The\r\nimmediate authority with which the President has to deal is vested in\r\nthe political mind. In order to get things done he has to work through\r\nthat agency. Some of our Presidents have appeared to lack comprehension\r\nof the political mind. Although I have been associated with it for many\r\nyears, I always found difficulty in understanding it. It is a strange\r\nmixture of vanity and timidity, of an obsequious attitude at one time\r\nand a delusion of grandeur at another time, of the most selfish\r\npreferment combined with the most sacrificing patriotism. The political\r\nmind is the product of men in public life who have been twice spoiled.\r\nThey have been spoiled with praise and they have been spoiled with\r\nabuse. With them nothing is natural, everything is artificial. A few\r\nrare souls escape these influences and maintain a vision and a judgment\r\nthat are unimpaired. They are a great comfort to every President and a\r\ngreat service to their country. But they are not sufficient in number so\r\nthat the public business can be transacted like a private business.\r\n\r\nIt is because in their hours of timidity the Congress becomes\r\nsubservient to the importunities of organized minorities that the\r\nPresident comes more and more to stand as the champion of the rights of\r\nthe whole country. Organizing such minorities has come to be a\r\nwell-recognized industry at Washington. They are oftentimes led by\r\npersons of great ability, who display much skill in bringing their\r\ninfluences to bear on the Congress. They have ways of securing\r\nnewspaper publicity, deluging Senators and Representatives with\r\npetitions and overwhelming them with imprecations that are oftentimes\r\ndecisive in securing the passage of bills. While much of this\r\nlegislation is not entirely bad, almost all of it is excessively\r\nexpensive. If it were not for the rules of the House and the veto power\r\nof the President, within two years these activities would double the\r\ncost of the government.\r\n\r\nUnder our system the President is not only the head of the government,\r\nbut is also the head of his party. The last twenty years have witnessed\r\na decline in party spirit and a distinct weakening in party loyalty.\r\nWhile an independent attitude on the part of the citizen is not without\r\na certain public advantage, yet it is necessary under our form of\r\ngovernment to have political parties. Unless some one is a partisan, no\r\none can be an independent. The Congress is organized entirely in\r\naccordance with party policy. The parties appeal to the voters in behalf\r\nof their platforms. The people make their choice on those issues. Unless\r\nthose who are elected on the same party platform associate themselves\r\ntogether to carry out its provisions, the election becomes a mockery.\r\nThe independent voter who has joined with others in placing a party\r\nnominee in office finds his efforts were all in vain, if the person he\r\nhelps elect refuses or neglects to keep the platform pledges of his\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nMany occasions arise in the Congress when party lines are very properly\r\ndisregarded, but if there is to be a reasonable government proceeding in\r\naccordance with the express mandate of the people, and not merely at the\r\nwhim of those who happen to be victorious at the polls, on all the\r\nlarger and important issues there must be party solidarity. It is the\r\nbusiness of the President as party leader to do the best he can to see\r\nthat the declared party platform purposes are translated into\r\nlegislative and administrative action. Oftentimes I secured support from\r\nthose without my party and had opposition from those within my party, in\r\nattempting to keep my platform pledges.\r\n\r\nSuch a condition is entirely anomalous. It leaves the President as the\r\nsole repository of party responsibility. But it is one of the reasons\r\nthat the Presidential office has grown in popular estimation and favor,\r\nwhile the Congress has declined. The country feels that the President is\r\nwilling to assume responsibility, while his party in the Congress is\r\nnot. I have never felt it was my duty to attempt to coerce Senators or\r\nRepresentatives, or to take reprisals. The people sent them to\r\nWashington. I felt I had discharged my duty when I had done the best I\r\ncould with them. In this way I avoided almost entirely a personal\r\nopposition, which I think was of more value to the country than to\r\nattempt to prevail through arousing personal fear.\r\n\r\nUnder our system it ought to be remembered that the power to initiate\r\npolicies has to be centralized somewhere. Unless the party leaders\r\nexercising it can depend on loyalty and organization support, the party\r\nin which it is reposed will become entirely ineffective. A party which\r\nis ineffective will soon be discarded. If a party is to endure as a\r\nserviceable instrument of government for the country, it must possess\r\nand display a healthy spirit of party loyalty. Such a manifestation in\r\nthe Congress would do more than anything else to rehabilitate it in the\r\nesteem and confidence of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is natural for man to seek power. It was because of this trait of\r\nhuman nature that the founders of our institutions provided a system of\r\nchecks and balances. They placed all their public officers under\r\nconstitutional limitations. They had little fear of the courts and were\r\ninclined to regard legislative bodies as the natural champions of their\r\nliberties. They were very apprehensive that the executive might seek to\r\nexercise arbitrary powers. Under our Constitution such fears seldom have\r\nbeen well founded. The President has tended to become the champion of\r\nthe people because he is held solely responsible for his acts, while in\r\nthe Congress where responsibility is divided it has developed that there\r\nis much greater danger of arbitrary action.\r\n\r\nIt has therefore become increasingly imperative that the President\r\nshould resist any encroachment upon his constitutional powers. One of\r\nthe most important of these is the power of appointment. The\r\nConstitution provides that he shall nominate, and by and with the advice\r\nand consent of the Senate appoint. A constant pressure is exerted by the\r\nSenators to make their own nominations and the Congress is constantly\r\nproposing laws which undertake to deprive the President of the\r\nappointive power. Different departments and bureaus are frequently\r\nsupporting measures that would make them self-perpetuating bodies to\r\nwhich no appointments could be made that they did not originate. While I\r\nhave always sought cooperation and advice, I have likewise resisted\r\nthese efforts, sometimes by refusing to adopt recommendations and\r\nsometimes by the exercise of the veto power. One of the farm relief\r\nbills, and later a public health measure, had these clearly\r\nunconstitutional limitations on the power of appointment. In the defense\r\nof the rights and liberties of the people it is necessary for the\r\nPresident to resist all encroachments upon his lawful authority.\r\n\r\nAll of these trials and encouragements come to each President. It is\r\nimpossible to explain them. Even after passing through the Presidential\r\noffice, it still remains a great mystery. Why one person is selected for\r\nit and many others are rejected can not be told. Why people respond as\r\nthey do to its influence seems to be beyond inquiry. Any man who has\r\nbeen placed in the White House can not feel that it is the result of\r\nhis own exertions or his own merit. Some power outside and beyond him\r\nbecomes manifest through him. As he contemplates the workings of his\r\noffice, he comes to realize with an increasing sense of humility that he\r\nis but an instrument in the hands of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY I DID NOT CHOOSE TO RUN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER SEVEN_\r\n\r\nWHY I DID NOT CHOOSE TO RUN\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have already indicated some of the reasons why I did not\r\ndesire to be a candidate to succeed myself.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and\r\nthose who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be\r\nspent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we\r\nfeel is beyond our strength to accomplish.\r\n\r\nI had never wished to run in 1928 and had determined to make a public\r\nannouncement at a sufficiently early date so that the party would have\r\nample time to choose some one else. An appropriate occasion for that\r\nannouncement seemed to be the fourth anniversary of my taking office.\r\nThe reasons I can give may not appear very convincing, but I am\r\nconfident my decision was correct.\r\n\r\nMy personal and official relations have all been peculiarly pleasant.\r\nThe Congress has not always done all that I wished, but it has done very\r\nlittle that I did not approve. So far as I can judge, I have been\r\nespecially fortunate in having the approbation of the country.\r\n\r\nBut irrespective of the third-term policy, the Presidential office is of\r\nsuch a nature that it is difficult to conceive how one man can\r\nsuccessfully serve the country for a term of more than eight years.\r\n\r\nWhile I am in favor of continuing the long-established custom of the\r\ncountry in relation to a third term for a President, yet I do not think\r\nthat the practice applies to one who has succeeded to part of a term as\r\nVice-President. Others might argue that it does, but I doubt if the\r\ncountry would so consider it.\r\n\r\nAlthough my own health has been practically perfect, yet the duties are\r\nvery great and ten years would be a very heavy strain. It would be\r\nespecially long for the Mistress of the White House. Mrs. Coolidge has\r\nbeen in more than usual good health, but I doubt if she could have\r\nstayed there for ten years without some danger of impairment of her\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nA President should not only not be selfish, but he ought to avoid the\r\nappearance of selfishness. The people would not have confidence in a man\r\nthat appeared to be grasping for office.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for men in high office to avoid the malady of\r\nself-delusion. They are always surrounded by worshipers. They are\r\nconstantly, and for the most part sincerely, assured of their greatness.\r\n\r\nThey live in an artificial atmosphere of adulation and exaltation which\r\nsooner or later impairs their judgment. They are in grave danger of\r\nbecoming careless and arrogant.\r\n\r\nThe chances of having wise and faithful public service are increased by\r\na change in the Presidential office after a moderate length of time.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for the head of the nation to differ with many people\r\nwho are honest in their opinions. As his term progresses, the number who\r\nare disappointed accumulates. Finally, there is so large a body who have\r\nlost confidence in him that he meets a rising opposition which makes his\r\nefforts less effective.\r\n\r\nIn the higher ranges of public service men appear to come forward to\r\nperform a certain duty. When it is performed their work is done. They\r\nusually find it impossible to readjust themselves in the thought of the\r\npeople so as to pass on successfully to the solution of new public\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the records of those Presidents who have served eight\r\nyears will disclose that in almost every instance the latter part of\r\ntheir term has shown very little in the way of constructive\r\naccomplishment. They have often been clouded with grave disappointments.\r\n\r\nWhile I had a desire to be relieved of the pretensions and delusions of\r\npublic life, it was not because of any attraction of pleasure or\r\nidleness.\r\n\r\nWe draw our Presidents from the people. It is a wholesome thing for them\r\nto return to the people. I came from them. I wish to be one of them\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAlthough all our Presidents have had back of them a good heritage of\r\nblood, very few have been born to the purple. Fortunately, they are not\r\nsupported at public expense after leaving office, so they are not\r\nexpected to set an example encouraging to a leisure class.\r\n\r\nThey have only the same title to nobility that belongs to all our\r\ncitizens, which is the one based on achievement and character, so they\r\nneed not assume superiority. It is becoming for them to engage in some\r\ndignified employment where they can be of service as others are.\r\n\r\nOur country does not believe in idleness. It honors hard work. I wanted\r\nto serve the country again as a private citizen.\r\n\r\nIn making my public statement I was careful in the use of words. There\r\nwere some who reported that they were mystified as to my meaning when I\r\nsaid, “I do not choose to run.”\r\n\r\nAlthough I did not know it at the time, months later I found that\r\nWashington said practically the same thing. Certainly he said no more in\r\nhis Farewell Address, where he announced that “choice and prudence”\r\ninvited him to retire.\r\n\r\nThere were others who constantly demanded that I should state that if\r\nnominated I would refuse to accept. Such a statement would not be in\r\naccordance with my conception of the requirements of the Presidential\r\noffice. I never stated or formulated in my own mind what I should do\r\nunder such circumstances, but I was determined not to have that\r\ncontingency arise.\r\n\r\nI therefore sent the Secretary to the President, Everett Sanders, a man\r\nof great ability and discretion, to Kansas City with instructions to\r\nnotify several of the leaders of state delegations not to vote for me.\r\nHad I not done so, I am told, I should have been nominated.\r\n\r\nThe report that he had talked with me on the telephone after his\r\narrival, and I had told him I would not accept if nominated, was pure\r\nfabrication. I had no communication with him of any kind after he left\r\nWashington and did not give him any such instruction or message at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI thought if I could prevent being nominated, which I was able to do, it\r\nwould never be necessary for me to decide the other question. But in\r\norder to be perfectly free, I sent this notice, so that if I declined no\r\none could say I had misled him into supposing that I was willing to\r\nreceive his vote.\r\n\r\nI felt sure that the party and the country were in so strong a position\r\nthat they could easily nominate and elect some other candidate. The\r\nevents have confirmed my judgment.\r\n\r\nIn the primary campaign I was careful to make it known that I was not\r\npresenting any candidate. The friends of several of them no doubt\r\nrepresented that their candidate was satisfactory to me, which was true\r\nas far as it went.\r\n\r\nI can conceive a situation in which a President might be warranted in\r\nexercising the influence of his office in selecting his successor. That\r\ncondition did not exist in the last primary. The party had plenty of\r\nmaterial, which was available, and the candidate really should be the\r\nchoice of the people themselves. This is especially so now that so many\r\nof the states have laws for the direct expression of the choice of the\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\nA President in office can do very much about the nomination of his\r\nsuccessor, because of his influence with the convention, but the feeling\r\nthat he had forced a choice would place the nominee under a heavy\r\nhandicap.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention assembles it is almost certain that it will look\r\nabout to see what candidate has made the largest popular showing, and\r\nunless some peculiar disqualification develops it will nominate him.\r\n\r\nThat was what happened in the last convention, although no one had a\r\nmajority when the convention assembled.\r\n\r\nA strong group of the party in and outside of the Senate made the\r\nmistake of undertaking to oppose Mr. Hoover with a large number of local\r\ncandidates, which finally resulted in their not developing enough\r\nstrength for any particular candidate to make a showing sufficient to\r\nimpress the convention.\r\n\r\nAlthough I did not intimate in any way that I would not accept the\r\nnomination, when I sent word to the heads of certain unpledged state\r\ndelegations not to vote for me, they very naturally turned to Mr.\r\nHoover, which brought about his nomination on the first ballot.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential office differs from everything else. Much of it cannot\r\nbe described, it can only be felt. After I had considered the reasons\r\nfor my being a candidate on the one side and on the other, I could not\r\nsay that any of them moved me with compelling force.\r\n\r\nMy election seemed assured. Nevertheless, I felt it was not best for the\r\ncountry that I should succeed myself. A new impulse is more likely to be\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore my privilege, after seeing my administration so\r\nstrongly indorsed by the country, to retire voluntarily from the\r\ngreatest experience that can come to mortal man. In that way, I believed\r\nI could best serve the people who have honored me and the country which\r\nI love.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
