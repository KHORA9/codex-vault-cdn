The steamers of the North German Lloyd Company, which sail\r\nfrom Genoa and Naples, through the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus,\r\nare best, but they visit only the ports on the northern coast. The\r\nAustrian Lloyd steamers, which come from Trieste, are second best,\r\nand we were fortunate in obtaining cabins on the _Euterpe_, which is\r\nold-fashioned, but comfortable. The captain is an Italian of Trieste,\r\nwho speaks English well, as do two of the under officers; the steward\r\nis thoughtful and attentive and the cook is beyond criticism.\r\n\r\nThe passengers were a perfect babel, representing all the races and\r\nspeaking all the tongues of the East, with several Europeans mixed in,\r\neach wearing his own peculiar costume. There were Turks of all kinds\r\nand all classes and all ages wearing fezzes of red felt; there were\r\nPersians, wearing fezzes of black lamb’s-wool; Albanians with fezzes\r\nof white felt, and Jews with turbans and long robes, such as they used\r\nto wear in the days of the Scriptures. We had several Turkish army\r\nofficers to amuse us, and one big, blue-eyed general, who looked like\r\na philanthropist, but is said to be a fiend of a fighter. There were\r\nEnglish, German, and French tourists and rug buyers on their way to\r\nPersia and Turkestan; a very fat Austrian woman who was going to visit\r\nher son, consul at Batoum, and several Russians who had been visiting\r\nParis and the Riviera and were on their way back to their homes in the\r\nCaucasus.\r\n\r\nWe had five different kinds of clergymen--Mohammedan mullahs, wearing\r\nlong robes and red fezzes with white turbans wound around them,\r\nGreek and Armenian priests, who are difficult to distinguish, and\r\nthree Capuchin monks. One of them was a venerable old gentleman with\r\na patriarchal beard, and one was a mere boy who smoked cigarettes\r\nincessantly--and a cigarette does not fit in well with the hood and\r\nrobe of a monk. The Capuchins have several monasteries in Asia Minor,\r\nand maintain schools and do parish work in several of the cities along\r\nthe coast, where there are communities of Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nThere were several Armenians in frock suits of broadcloth, low-cut\r\nvests, and snowy shirt bosoms, like those affected by lawyers in\r\nMississippi and Arkansas, and one howling dervish. He did not look\r\na bit as you would expect, but was a jaunty fellow in a fancy shirt\r\nof black cotton with white spots, without a collar, and an ordinary\r\nsack suit of gray European clothes over which he wore his distinctive\r\ncoat of camel’s hair with wide sleeves and facings and trimmings of\r\nbroad black braid, and on his shaven head a fez of gray wool with a\r\nwide band of black around it. He carried a dainty cane and whirled it\r\naround in his fingers like a dandy when he promenaded the deck. He\r\nwas a presumptuous young dervish, for he endeavoured to enjoy the\r\nprivileges of first-class passengers on a third-class ticket, which\r\nthe deck steward would not permit. And when he did not go back to his\r\nproper place, after being told to do so, he was rudely elbowed down the\r\nstairs. It was not a respectful way to treat a saint in embryo, which\r\nhowling dervishes are supposed to be, but I suppose the deck steward\r\nhad his orders, and perhaps he was accustomed to dealing with such men.\r\n\r\nMost of the Turks in the first-class cabin did not come to the table,\r\nbecause they will not eat Christian food for fear that lard or some\r\nother extract of the despised pig was used in its preparation. They\r\ntook their meals in their state-rooms, with their wives and children,\r\nwhere they made their own coffee over spirit lamps and drank water from\r\nred earthen jugs which they had filled at the sacred fountains before\r\nleaving Constantinople. The women did not leave their cabins until they\r\nreached their destination, when they climbed blindly down the gangways\r\ninto the row-boats, with veils drawn closely over their faces and their\r\nbodies enveloped in large shawls.\r\n\r\nSeveral Persians in the first cabin came to their meals regularly, and\r\nbrought their appetites with them. The Koran applies to them the same\r\nas it does to the Turks, but those gentlemen were not so pious as they\r\nshould be. And I noticed that none of the Mohammedan passengers, except\r\nthe mullahs and one general, said their prayers when the time came. The\r\ngeneral was very devout. He wore a long, light-gray overcoat, reaching\r\nto his heels, which he kept so closely buttoned that we wondered if he\r\nhad anything under it, and, like all military men over here, Russians,\r\nAustrians, and Turks, he never put aside his sword, not even when he\r\nspread his prayer rug on the deck and turned his face toward Mecca to\r\npray.\r\n\r\nThe other first-class Mohammedan passengers paid no attention whatever\r\nto the hours for devotions, which gave me a disagreeable shock, because\r\nI have always understood that a Moslem is so conscientious that he will\r\nsay his prayers five times a day at the proper moment, no matter what\r\nhe happens to be doing or where he happens to be.\r\n\r\nMany of the third-class passengers, who are compelled to sleep on the\r\nopen deck, performed their duties regularly. They spread their prayer\r\nrugs carefully down in the first open place they could find, and,\r\nturning their eyes toward Mecca, went through with the genuflections\r\nwhich are a part of the Mohammedan ritual, and cried in loud voices\r\nthat there is no God but Allah. Several of the private soldiers, and we\r\nhad a large number on board, said their prayers regularly, regardless\r\nof their surroundings, but the majority of them did not and probably\r\nnot more than one out of five of the Moslem passengers paid any\r\nattention to the hours of prayer.\r\n\r\nTwo of the mullahs in the first-class end of the ship had handsomely\r\nbound books from which they read aloud, as is their custom. Turkish\r\nstudents always study aloud. When you are riding along through country\r\nvillages in the East you can locate the school-houses by the murmur\r\nof the voices of the pupils learning their lessons. If you go into a\r\nmosque that is used for educational purposes you can always find groups\r\nof students squatting on the floor, rocking their bodies back and forth\r\nwith a motion as regular as that of a rocking chair, and repeating the\r\nlines of their lessons in loud voices.\r\n\r\nI once asked a Mohammedan teacher in a Syrian mosque why this is done.\r\nHe explained that people understand that which they learn through\r\ntheir ears better than that which they learn through their eyes. In\r\nthe second place, he said, when a person studies aloud the mind is\r\nkept upon the subject intently and is not so apt to wander; thirdly, a\r\nperson who is studying aloud is not so apt to go to sleep as when he\r\nreads to himself--and the danger of falling asleep is the reason for\r\nthe rocking motion of the body which all students practise when they\r\nare at their books.\r\n\r\nOn the forward deck, where the anchor winch is, was camped a group\r\nof Persians. Some of them were merchants of Constantinople and other\r\ncities on their way to their native country to buy rugs and other\r\ngoods; others were faithful Mohammedans returning from pilgrimages\r\nto Mecca. They were dignified, thoughtful persons with dreamy eyes\r\nand intensely black beards, and two or three old men had made\r\nthemselves supremely ridiculous by the use of henna, which gives hair\r\na bright scarlet hue. It reminded me of What’s-His-Name in “Alice in\r\nWonderland,” who suggested that it would be awfully funny if everybody\r\nwould dye his whiskers green.\r\n\r\n     “And hide our heads behind our fans\r\n      So they cannot be seen.”\r\n\r\nOthers had their finger nails stained scarlet with the same stuff,\r\nwhich gives a startling effect.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the deck from the Armenians was a nest of\r\ntheir hereditary enemies, Kurds--tall, robust, brown fellows, with\r\nsnub noses, small, fierce eyes and garments that are indescribable\r\nbecause of the variety of cut and colour. They lay around smoking\r\ncigarettes in the most indolent manner, each having what looked like an\r\nold-fashioned quilted comfortable for a mattress and an embroidered bag\r\nfor a pillow.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of all were the Lazis, from Lazistan, short,\r\nbroad-shouldered, muscular chaps, most of whom brought their wives and\r\nchildren with them and camped amidship on the open deck like a lot of\r\ngypsies. The women were entirely concealed in shawls of cotton or silk\r\nthat cover the head as well as the body, and they squatted in groups\r\nin the same place all day long, scarcely moving a muscle except when\r\ntheir husbands were hungry, and then they would dig down into a bag and\r\nproduce a loaf of bread, a dried fish, a few onions, and other simple\r\nforms of food.\r\n\r\nThere were several babies scattered about promiscuously in\r\nbright-coloured wrappings, and a number of children under ten years\r\nold. Some of them had dainty features and lovely eyes, and a better\r\nbehaved lot of children you never saw. We did not hear one of them\r\ncry during the entire voyage. They lay in their clumsy, queer-looking\r\ncradles, made by rude carpenters, without the slightest attention, as\r\nself-satisfied as if they had been millionaires smothered in luxury.\r\n\r\nOne night the peasants from Lazistan gave an interesting performance.\r\nThe music was furnished by an ordinary bagpipe with three stops, which\r\nemitted a mournful and monotonous refrain, but with perfect time, and\r\nthe dancers kept step to it very much after the manner of the North\r\nAmerican Indian. They placed a child in the centre, a dozen or so of\r\nthem clasped hands in a circle, alternately spreading out as far as\r\ntheir arms would reach and then coming together in a bunch, and in the\r\nmeantime stamping their feet, bowing the knees, and bending the upper\r\npart of the body forward. Sometimes they would stoop to a squatting\r\nposture and hop along on one side and then on the other; then they\r\nwould raise their arms as high as they could reach, revolving all the\r\ntime to the left. It was a graceful movement and rather fascinating,\r\nand they seemed to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe third-class passengers who occupy the open deck, make themselves\r\nas comfortable as possible with big bundles of rugs and blankets and\r\npillows, which they spread out wherever the boatswain will let them.\r\nThey gave us a continuous performance abounding in life and a gorgeous\r\nriot of colour, entirely unconscious of their odd ways, their artistic\r\nposes, and the entertainment they were furnishing to the foreigners\r\nwho could look down upon them from the afterdeck. The captain told me\r\nthat there were doubtless thirty different races among the passengers\r\nupon that ship--Turks, Tartars, Mongols, Arabs, Armenians, Albanians,\r\nCircassians, Georgians, Greeks, Jews, Kurds, Lazis, Slavs, Syrians,\r\nTurkomans, Bokharoits, Wallachs, and Persians of various clans, which\r\ncan be detected one from another by experts, because of the way they\r\nwear their clothes. Everybody except the women wore brilliant colours,\r\nand they were shut off from observation as much as possible by blankets\r\npinned to the canvas awning so as to make screens.\r\n\r\nTurks are very democratic. Islam recognizes no caste; there is no\r\naristocracy or nobility or any divisions among the Turks except on an\r\nofficial basis and the inferiors show great respect to those who are\r\nabove them. The ordinary Turkish peasant is good-natured, honest,\r\nsober, patient, frugal, industrious, and capable of great endurance.\r\nHe is not fanatical, but is kindly disposed toward everybody. His\r\nhospitality is unbounded and the exercise of charity is one of his\r\ngreatest pleasures. Two ragged fellows came up to the first-class deck\r\none day, bringing a wash basin of graniteware painted a bright blue,\r\nwhich they passed around, asking contributions for the benefit of a\r\nsick man with five children who was lying helpless on the open deck and\r\nought to be given shelter below in the second-class cabin, which he had\r\nno money to pay for. I noticed that everybody chipped in something,\r\nfrom the glittering general to the tatterdemalions who lay sprawled\r\nupon their blankets in the shady places.\r\n\r\nEvery third-class passenger had a basket of provisions and a jug of\r\nwater, and an old man fixed himself a place in the corner, where he set\r\nup a samovar and made coffee to sell. He did a good business, too. His\r\nlittle brass pot was always in motion, because Turks are inveterate\r\ncoffee drinkers and want a cup of that beverage every few minutes. The\r\nold coffee seller was a picture--a Turk from Samsoun, a good-natured\r\nold fellow with a wrinkled face, a curly beard, a white turban, and a\r\nsmile like that of our President, which won’t come off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coffee peddler on our steamer]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Turk of Trebizard]\r\n\r\nThe beauties of the Bosphorus have often been described, and probably\r\nno sheet of water of corresponding length is so highly decorated by\r\nnature and by man. There are a dozen splendid palaces, some of the\r\nmost imposing residences in all the world, sitting on the very edge of\r\nthe water at the foot of the hills which enclose the Bosphorus. The\r\nDolma Bactche Palace, now occupied by the sultan, is perhaps the\r\nfinest, and near it is another equally famous, the Cherigan Palace,\r\nwhich was occupied by the Turkish Parliament until it was burned in\r\nFebruary, 1910. The roofless walls, stained with smoke, and the hollow\r\nwindows now stand mute, unable to testify in their own defence and\r\nsolve the mystery whether the calamity was due to arson or accident.\r\nIt is generally assumed that the fire was started by incendiaries, for\r\nit seemed to break out in several places at the same time, and burned\r\nso fiercely as to suggest inflammables. However, there is no definite\r\nknowledge on the subject. It occurred in the night, the watchmen were\r\nasleep or absent, there were no police in the neighbourhood, and one\r\nof the most exquisite gems of architecture in existence was a hideous\r\nskeleton of marble before an attempt to save it could be organized.\r\n\r\nThe possible motive of an incendiary was to destroy a mass of documents\r\ndiscovered in the Yildiz Kiosk after the forcible evacuation of Abdul\r\nHamid. His archives, official and personal, filled fifty carts and were\r\nhauled away to some unknown place, where they were being sorted over\r\nby a parliamentary commission, and already extraordinary discoveries\r\nhad been made concerning the treachery and hypocrisy of prominent\r\nmen. There has been and still is a determination on the part of\r\ncertain personages, whose reputations will be ruined, to prevent the\r\npublication of these papers, and there have been several stormy debates\r\nin the Chamber of Deputies on the subject. Lacking other explanations,\r\nit has been assumed that the Cherigan Palace was set on fire for the\r\npurpose of destroying these private papers of the ex-sultan, although\r\nit was a useless sacrifice. The documents were not there. Few people\r\nknew where they were, except the commission which was engaged in\r\nclassifying them.\r\n\r\nCherigan Palace stood on the shore of the Bosphorus about two miles\r\nfrom the bridge which connects Galata and Stamboul, and it was the most\r\nattractive and artistic of all the many buildings which give that water\r\ncourse its fame. It was built about sixty years ago by Abdul Aziz, who\r\nwas sultan from 1861 to 1876, and was the best ruler Turkey has known\r\nfor centuries. He intended it for his own residence, lived there for\r\ntwelve years, and died there in a most tragic manner, June 17, 1876.\r\nThere his son, Murad V, was allowed to reign for a few months, until\r\nhe was deposed by a conspiracy which placed Abdul Hamid, the late\r\nsultan, in power, and the latter kept his elder brother a prisoner\r\nwithin its beautiful walls for several years, until he, too, was taken\r\noff in a mysterious way--some believe by suicide and some by violence.\r\nHowever, no prison was ever more artistic in design or expensive in\r\nconstruction. It was entirely of marble, inside and out, and the\r\ninterior was remarkable for the richness of the carvings and of the\r\nhangings and upholstery and for the beauty of the mural decorations.\r\nWhen the Parliament was organized, Cherigan Palace seemed to be the\r\nmost convenient building for its sessions. The Senate sat in the state\r\ndining-room, and the Chamber of Deputies in the ballroom, which were\r\neasily fitted up for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThere are several hotels on the Bosphorus, which are occupied during\r\nthe summer, and all of the great nations, except the United States,\r\nhave handsome residences for their embassies in a water suburb known\r\nas Therapia. The Russian embassy is the last and looks directly up\r\nthe narrow throat which leads from the Bosphorus into the Black Sea.\r\nBoth sides of this passage are guarded by heavy earthworks against a\r\nRussian invasion. Turkey fears no other nation and Russia cannot reach\r\nher southern coast by sea without going through Turkish waters. This\r\nsituation has exasperated every Russian since Peter the Great, who is\r\nsupposed to have left a will in which he admonished his successors\r\nnever to rest until they have added the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn\r\nto the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\nRobert College, an American institution which has turned out some of\r\nthe best men in the East, and an old Byzantine castle which dates\r\nback many centuries, are the most conspicuous objects on the European\r\nside, and near them is a sightly location where Dr. Mary Patrick has\r\nerected new buildings for the American College for Girls, with funds\r\ncontributed by friends in the United States. Her former buildings in\r\nScutari were not half big enough, since the constitution was adopted,\r\nto accommodate the young Turkish women who want an education.\r\n\r\nThe first town of importance, sailing eastward from Constantinople\r\nalong the southern coast of the Black Sea, is the ancient City of\r\nSamsoun, founded by the Greeks more than two thousand five hundred\r\nyears ago, and always of consequence commercially. It has a splendid\r\nlocation, sloping gradually upward from the sea, but like many people,\r\nas well as towns, does not fulfil the expectations excited by its\r\nappearance from a distance. There is a big hospital for soldiers upon\r\na slight eminence back of the town; several minarets show where the\r\nmosques are; the five domes of a Greek church glisten in the sun;\r\nseveral imposing business blocks and residences line up well along\r\nthe seashore and give a brave appearance to the place: but when you\r\nland, you are disappointed to find the streets narrow and dirty, with a\r\nmixture of smells arising from unknown sources, wretched pavements, and\r\nmangy dogs lying around in the sun scratching themselves in a way that\r\nis more suggestive than comfortable. Scratching is sometimes contagious.\r\n\r\nBut the narrow streets are interesting, and the market place,\r\nwith a circular fountain and an ancient mosque, offers one of the\r\nquaintest and most picturesque Oriental scenes you could imagine. In\r\nthe foreground a butter dealer in an indescribable costume of more\r\ncolours than Joseph could possibly have had in his coat, was ladling\r\ngreasy-looking stuff from a great tub with a wooden spoon and, on\r\nhis scales, he used stones for weights. The vegetables and oranges\r\nwere fine. Onions and garlic could be felt in the air, both in the\r\nraw material and in the finished form of odours. Turks are largely\r\nvegetarians. Vegetables, fruits, and soups made of grain are the chief\r\narticles of their diet. We were told that Samsoun is a great place\r\nfor apples, so much so that the bears come down in droves from the\r\nmountains back of the town when the fruit is ripe and rob the orchards.\r\nWe tried some of the apples which the peasants sell by weight in the\r\nmarket place, and found them dry and tasteless, but I don’t think they\r\nwere to blame. No apples are good in May.\r\n\r\nThere is a café every few yards on every street, where it seemed as if\r\nthe entire male population were sipping coffee and smoking cigarettes.\r\nWe saw a few nargiles--those long-tubed water pipes which are generally\r\nassociated with cross-legged Turks--in Constantinople, but did not\r\nfind one anywhere else. I suppose they are out of style, for all the\r\nTurks that we met were smoking cigarettes instead.\r\n\r\nQuantities of licorice root are shipped from Samsoun. It grows wild in\r\nthe mountains. The quality, as well as the value, might be improved\r\nby cultivation, but such a thing has never been attempted on a large\r\nscale. The sheep upon the mountain sides furnish cargoes of wool, and\r\nthe cattle we saw grazing in large herds add many hides, but tobacco\r\nis the chief article of export from Samsoun, and a boy who voluntarily\r\nattached himself to our party and followed us along, chattering as he\r\nwent, told us that a large establishment surrounded by a high wall\r\nbelonged to Americans.\r\n\r\nHow a Turkish lad, who presumably had never been out of his native\r\nplace, could have identified us as Americans is remarkable, for\r\nin Oriental countries, even in China and Japan, the natives are\r\nseldom able to distinguish between Uncle Sam and John Bull; but,\r\nnevertheless, we acted on the welcome information and soon found three\r\nfellow-countrymen representing the American Tobacco Company purely for\r\nthe purpose of buying cigarette material, and, in 1909, they shipped\r\n$397,000 in tobacco from that port alone. There are several other\r\nbuyers for the American market, but they come and go with the season.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco produced around Samsoun is light of colour, and of fine\r\nflavour, especially suited for cigarettes. There is a great difference\r\nin the quality according to the care and cultivation, and the Americans\r\nhave persuaded a few of the farmers to improve their methods and\r\nimplements. They told me that twice the present crop might be produced\r\nfrom the same area if half the care and skill were expended upon it\r\nthat the Cuban planters give to their tobacco. Samsoun expects to be\r\nthe northern terminus of one of the railways which have been authorized\r\nby the Turkish Parliament.\r\n\r\nIf you will look on your map you will notice that Asia Minor is that\r\npart of Turkey which projects into the Mediterranean on the Asiatic\r\nside, an almost square peninsula about three hundred miles each way.\r\nIt is bounded on the north by the Black Sea, on the east by Armenia\r\nand Kurdistan, on the south by Syria and the Mediterranean and on the\r\nwest by the Ægean Sea. The western portion of Asia Minor is called\r\nAnatolia. It is densely settled by Turkish farmers who cultivate the\r\nground in a primitive, awkward way, but do not realize more than half\r\nthe value of their labour; first, because of their primitive tools and\r\ninstruments and their imperfect cultivation, and, second, because there\r\nare no transportation facilities by which they can send their produce\r\nto market. There are two railways running into the interior from the\r\nMediterranean coast, furnishing communication for about 10 per cent. of\r\nthe population. Throughout 90 per cent. of Asia Minor the only way of\r\ntravelling is on the back of a horse or a donkey and the only facility\r\nfor moving freight is by caravans of camels, which are slow and very\r\nexpensive. For these reasons the inhabitants depend to a great extent\r\nupon their own resources. They make everything they wear except cotton\r\nfabrics and have very little to ship away.\r\n\r\nAlmost directly south of Samsoun, about a hundred miles, is the\r\nMarsovan station of the American Board, first occupied in 1852, and\r\nfor fifty-eight years the headquarters of missionary work, not only\r\nfor that important city, but for a wide reach of country, including\r\nSamsoun, Amasia, and other important towns. The work has naturally been\r\nbuilt up by a process of growth. Little day schools, teaching reading,\r\nwriting, and spelling in the vernacular, have developed into two great\r\ninstitutions: Anatolia College, with its extensive buildings devoted to\r\nthe collegiate training of young men, and the Girls’ High and Boarding\r\nSchool, an institution quite by itself, giving nearly the same complete\r\ncourse of study that is given to the young men.\r\n\r\nThese two schools have ample grounds and are both adding gradually to\r\ntheir large plants. The college for young men will soon have $30,000\r\nworth of new buildings, which amount will erect about eight times\r\nas much as in the United States. The girls’ school has completely\r\noutgrown its large plant, completed only a few years ago, and is adding\r\nsubstantial new buildings.\r\n\r\nThe college for boys has in a peculiar way taken hold upon southern\r\nRussia. Three or four years ago Russian students began to come across\r\nthe Black Sea, and have doubled in number every year since. It was\r\nfeared at first that they might be unruly and disorderly, or perhaps\r\nrevolutionary in their tendencies, but, quite contrary to expectations,\r\nthey have proved to be among the most steady, earnest, able students\r\nthe college has had. Like Robert College, at Constantinople, Anatolia\r\nhas Greek, Mohammedan, and Armenian students. Greeks are not found in\r\ncolleges east of Marsovan, to any extent.\r\n\r\nThe college has also, as a part of its organization, a large medical\r\ndepartment with extensive hospitals and a nurses’ training school\r\nunder the direction of two efficient American physicians, Dr. Jesse\r\nK. Marden and Dr. Alden R. Hoover, assisted by a large native medical\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\nPatients come to the hospital at Marsovan from a wide area of country\r\nand it is reaching not only the Armenians but the Mohammedan classes.\r\nThe medical service has an unmeasured influence upon the people of the\r\ncountry and makes an impression which no other form of missionary work\r\ncan possibly do. The people know when they are ill and want medicines,\r\nbut they are not often aware when they are ignorant and need educating\r\nor are morally in need of spiritual uplift. When they meet with severe\r\naccidents, as so frequently occurs in that country, or when they are\r\nracked by disease, they quickly learn that relief can be found at\r\nthe mission hospital at Marsovan, and some means of reaching there\r\nis devised. They often go on a rude cart, sometimes upon the back\r\nof some animal, or, if they live upon a possible road, in a Turkish\r\naraba or hooded “carry-all.” They find their way to the hospital and\r\nthere receive the kind treatment which belongs to every hospital, but\r\nespecially to the missionary hospital in a non-Christian land. After\r\ntreatment, they return to their homes full of enthusiasm and gratitude\r\nfor what they have seen and received.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the institutions already mentioned, which have separate\r\nbuildings, there is a theological school for training native college\r\ngraduates for direct evangelistic work among their countrymen. This\r\nschool will soon have a separate building, having hitherto been\r\nconsidered a part of the college to which it was attached. The\r\nimportance of this work has now reached a stage where it demands a\r\nseparate home and possibly separate management.\r\n\r\nIndustrial work is an important adjunct to the college. It was started\r\nas a means of self-help, to enable students who could not pay their\r\ntuition or board to earn a part of it by manual labour, and American\r\nmachinery and tools were introduced for cabinet work according to\r\nmodern methods. This has proved so popular that it was necessary to\r\nmake a rule that no boy should take the mechanical courses alone,\r\nwithout taking some of the regular courses in the college or the\r\npreparatory school. Many fathers were so anxious to have their sons\r\nlearn to use tools and machinery and to make things, that they\r\nbrought them to the college and asked that they be admitted simply\r\nfor mechanical instruction. While the school has not been wholly\r\nself-supporting, the students have been able to earn a large part of\r\nthe cost of their education and have received instruction that could\r\nnot have been given them in any other way.\r\n\r\nThis kind of training is especially important in Turkey, where the\r\nidea has prevailed, and still prevails to no small extent, that when a\r\nman is educated he must not do anything that looks like manual labour.\r\nUnfortunately this delusion is not confined to Turkey. The mechanical\r\ndepartment is calculated to take that fallacy out of the minds of young\r\nmen, making them see that manual labour is no disgrace and that even\r\na scholar may do things with his hands. Turkey must come to the idea\r\nthat a scholar of the highest type may be a civil engineer, who will be\r\nrequired to do outdoor work. The industrial school at Marsovan is but a\r\npreparatory step to the larger comprehensions of the dignity of labour,\r\nwhile at the same time, it trains the students who come within its\r\ninfluence in mechanical exactness. There is much of value, missionaries\r\nhave learned, as well as educators in America, in training a boy to do\r\nsomething that is worth while in a mechanical way.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the medical work, it has been necessary for the American\r\nmissionaries to establish dispensaries where cases can be treated\r\ntemporarily, and especially where medicines can be provided for outside\r\npatients. It is so difficult to get pure drugs at regular Turkish\r\ndrug stores that it has been necessary for all the American hospitals\r\nin the country to establish and maintain their own dispensaries.\r\nTheir supplies, bought at wholesale, are sent out from the mission\r\nheadquarters in Boston, and, therefore, are reliable in every way. Many\r\nnative pharmacists are being properly trained. These dispensaries often\r\nprove almost as valuable for the lives and health of the people as the\r\nhospitals, and are regarded as a necessary adjunct of every hospital.\r\n\r\nAt Marsovan, to carry on this work in all departments, there are\r\nnineteen Americans: four ordained missionaries and their wives, three\r\nlaymen, two physicians, and six single women, all college graduates,\r\nand nearly all having taken from three to five years of post-graduate\r\nwork. Connected with them, and working with them in every way, are\r\nat least twenty-five times this number of trained native Christian\r\nleaders, many of whom are graduates of the college or other American\r\ninstitutions. Some have studied in Europe after taking a course in\r\nthe college at Marsovan. Upon the American staff, with the native\r\nassociates, also rests the responsibility of supervising native\r\nevangelistic work in a wide field. Tours of inspection are taken by the\r\nmissionaries from time to time, thus keeping them familiar with what is\r\ngoing on, so that they may devote their energies at the centre to the\r\ndemands of the work outside.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the way in which educational institutions grow,\r\nAnatolia College is an admirable example. The germ which produced\r\nthis great institution, now with more than three hundred students and\r\nseveral departments, was a little school in the corner of a stable in\r\nthe city of Marsovan in charge of Dr. C. C. Tracy. The stable filled\r\nthe greater part of the building, and in one of the corners, on a\r\nplatform of earth raised a foot or so above the common level of the\r\nmud floor, and protected by a light rail, was the school. Less than\r\na dozen children there took their first lessons in learning to read.\r\nAt the start, in common intelligence, they were but little in advance\r\nof the animals that occupied the rest of the room. No one could have\r\ndetected in that humble beginning the germ of an institution that now\r\ncovers several acres in buildings and campus just outside the large and\r\nflourishing city of Marsovan, filled with bright young men from all\r\nparts of Anatolia, from along the entire southern shore of the Black\r\nSea, and even from Russia, on the northern coast--studying for academic\r\ndegrees in preparation for positions of influence and leadership in the\r\nnew Turkish Empire.\r\n\r\nThis little stable school became a high school in 1886, and a\r\nfull-grown college a few years later. It now has a faculty of\r\ntwenty-three professors, fourteen of whom are natives of the country\r\nand eight have taken post-graduate courses to prepare themselves for\r\ntheir work. They have degrees from the New College at Edinburgh, the\r\nUniversity of Berlin, the University of Athens, the Imperial Law School\r\nat Constantinople, the Royal Conservatory of Music at Stuttgart and the\r\nAcademy at Paris.\r\n\r\nAnatolia College has sent out 224 graduates, of whom 207 are now\r\nliving. Fifty-two are engaged in teaching, forty-eight are practising\r\nmedicine, and eighty-six are in business. In addition to these\r\ngraduates, several thousand other young men have for a time studied in\r\nthe institution and for various reasons have been compelled to leave\r\nwithout completing the course. These have, however, gone out armed\r\nwith a new power which this college has given them, and many are doing\r\nsignal service within and without the Turkish Empire. Not long since,\r\nin a mixed gathering of Turks and Christians in Marsovan, profound\r\nthanks were expressed by Mohammedan leaders for this institution and\r\nwhat it has done to disseminate ideas of liberty, for the emancipation\r\nof women, and for the general welfare.\r\n\r\nAmong the students in the college, who come from about half of the\r\ntwenty-nine provinces of the Ottoman Empire, are also found natives of\r\nGreece, Albania, Egypt, and, as has already been stated, Russia. The\r\ncourses of study are similar to the usual college courses in the United\r\nStates, with the exception that more emphasis is put upon the living\r\nlanguages than upon the dead.\r\n\r\nCoasting along the south shore of the Black Sea, we were sailing\r\nthrough a land of fable, and our steamer touched at some scene of\r\nGreek mythology two or three times every day. At every port where we\r\nstopped to discharge or take on cargo we were surrounded by fleets\r\nof queer-looking boats with high-pointed prows and sterns, like the\r\ngondolas of Venice and the ancient galleys of the Greeks. There is\r\nalways an exciting scramble when the gangway is lowered, and the\r\nbarefooted boatmen climb over each other to get on board to solicit\r\nthe patronage of the passengers. Their costumes, their cries, their\r\ngesticulations, and the confusion they create make it hard to believe\r\nthat they are the descendants of gods and demi-gods, the heroes of the\r\npoems and the fables and legends we read in Greek mythology. The coast\r\nis bordered with a continuous range of magnificent mountains, rising\r\ngradually from the sea, clothed with forests on the upper heights and\r\nusually a strip of cultivated land along the coast. The successive\r\nranges, rising one above the other, culminate in snow-capped peaks in\r\nthe far background. The lower slopes and the coast line are dotted with\r\nvillages embowered in oak, chestnut, beech, walnut, and hazel trees and\r\nmasses of lilac, rhododendrons, azaleas, myrtles, orange groves, and\r\norchards of quince and cherry trees, which are all in blossom in April\r\nand May and make a charming picture.\r\n\r\nThe steamer stops usually from one to five hours, which is long\r\nenough to see everything that is interesting and gave us a good\r\nidea of northern Turkey, which, by the way, is very different from\r\nwhat I expected in many respects. Indeed it is necessary for every\r\none who goes there to revise his preconceived ideas of Turkish life\r\nand character; but the way we had to fight with the boatmen and the\r\nhackmen, who refused in almost every case to accept the fares agreed\r\nupon before starting, shows that the successors of Castor and Pollux,\r\nTheseus, Diana, and the other demi-gods have degenerated from the\r\nclassic days. It seemed almost incredible that we were actually\r\nvisiting the playgrounds of the gods. The imagination of the ancient\r\nGreeks peopled that beautiful coast with supernatural beings, who were\r\nthe heroes of their fables and their songs, and there was a mixture of\r\nhistory in them all.\r\n\r\nThe Argonauts, you will remember, sailed from Thessaly to Colchis under\r\ncommand of Jason, to fetch a golden fleece, which was suspended from an\r\noak tree in a grove, guarded day and night by a ferocious dragon. Jason\r\nbuilt a ship of fifty oars, called the _Argo_, after the name of the\r\ndesigner, who was instructed by the goddess Minerva.\r\n\r\nJason was accompanied upon this expedition by several of the greatest\r\nheroes of Greek fable, including Hercules, Castor and Pollux, Theseus,\r\nand others, who were called the Argonauts, after the name of the ship.\r\nThey met with surprising adventures, and when they arrived at their\r\ndestination the king of Colchis promised to give up the golden fleece\r\nprovided Jason would yoke together two fire-breathing oxen and sow\r\nthe teeth of the dragon which had not been used by Cadmus at Thebes.\r\nMeantime Medea, the daughter of the king, fell in love with the captain\r\nof the Argonauts, and, when he promised to marry her, showed him how\r\nto put to sleep the dragon that guarded the golden fleece, and how to\r\nprotect himself against the flames that came from the nostrils of those\r\nterrible steers. Jason did the stunt, to use a classic phrase, married\r\nthe girl, and sailed away with the treasure. After wandering about the\r\ncoast of the Black Sea and threading the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles,\r\nthe Argonauts at length arrived at Thessaly and told the story of their\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the fable of the Argonauts was founded upon a\r\ncommercial expedition which wealthy merchants of Thessaly sent out to\r\nexplore the coast of the Black Sea, twelve or fifteen hundred years\r\nbefore the Christian era, and the remains of the colonies they founded\r\nmay still be found along the shores of Asia Minor. This expedition\r\nwas followed by many Greeks from Miletus and other places who built a\r\nfringe of cities and towns on every bay and island along the coast.\r\nAnd their fleets carried on a commerce quite as important as that of\r\nto-day. All historic interest in the Black Sea centres around those\r\ncolonies, which brought with them the culture that distinguished the\r\nGreek from the barbarian of those days. Situated on carefully selected\r\nsites, which the traveller can still identify, these colonies became\r\nthe profitable markets where the products of Asia and those of Europe\r\nchanged hands.\r\n\r\nBut the Argonauts were not the only characters of mythology that may\r\nbe met with up there. The city of Eregli, the first port at which the\r\nsteamer touches after leaving the Bosphorus and entering the Black\r\nSea, stands on the site of Heraclea, a famous town founded by Hercules\r\nin prehistoric days; and in a garden north of the town is the cavern\r\ncalled Acherusia, through which he is supposed to have descended to\r\nthe infernal regions to encounter Cerberus, according to the story.\r\nNear this cave are the ruins of a Roman aqueduct and of two temples\r\nwhich have been converted into churches, and on the mountain side are\r\ncoal mines that were worked by the ancient Greek colonists before the\r\ndawn of history. Fuel was obtained from them, also, for the European\r\nbattleships during the Crimean war. These mines are said to contain an\r\nexcellent quality of steam and gas coal, but have never been developed\r\nbecause the Turkish government, for some reason or another, has not\r\npermitted it.\r\n\r\nA poisonous honey made in the neighbourhood of Heraclea, according\r\nto Pliny the historian, is supposed to have been derived from yellow\r\nazaleas and purple rhododendrons, which abound on the hillsides in\r\nthat neighbourhood. Even now the farmers cannot keep bees, because the\r\nhoney they produce invariably makes people ill.\r\n\r\nA little farther up the coast, the village of Bartan, known in ancient\r\ntimes as Parthenius, according to Greek fables was the home of Artemis,\r\nor the goddess Diana, as she is better known, who hunted deer and more\r\nharmful creatures among the forests upon the mountain sides and bathed\r\nin the waters of the river that comes bubbling down into the sea. Those\r\nwho do not believe this story can find proof in nearly every picture\r\ngallery of Europe, for acres of canvas have been covered with paintings\r\nof Diana, the divine huntress, and her achievements in forest and field.\r\n\r\nThe next village, Amastris, was the birthplace of the wife of Darius,\r\nthe great Persian king, and Dionysius, the Roman tyrant, and in a\r\ngossippy letter to the emperor Trajan Pliny describes Amastris as “a\r\nhandsome city.” It continued to be a port of importance as late as the\r\nninth century. The Venetians and the Genoese occupied it in turn in the\r\nMiddle Ages several times. The site of the ancient city is now occupied\r\nby an insignificant village, and the only reminder of the power and\r\nprosperity associated with its past are the ruins of a citadel, an\r\naqueduct, and fortifications.\r\n\r\nThe port of Sinub is the ancient Sinope, the mother colony founded by\r\nAutolycus, a companion of Hercules, and the most important of all the\r\nGreek colonies on the Euxine or Black Sea. Here the cynic philosopher,\r\nDiogenes, was born. It was also the birthplace of Mithridates the\r\nGreat, who ruled Asia Minor and all the country surrounding it several\r\nhundred years before Christ. During the time of Pericles, Sinope was\r\nthe strongest and most important of all the colonies of Greece, having\r\nthe only safe harbour on the southern coast. It was the terminus of the\r\nroyal road which extended from the Persian Gulf through Mesopotamia,\r\nfollowing the valley of the Euphrates to the shores of the Black Sea.\r\nSinub is surrounded by high-wooded mountains which were occupied by the\r\nfabled Amazons, and upon the island called Adasi, there was a temple to\r\nMars erected by and presided over by two Amazonian queens.\r\n\r\nOne of the stories connected with Sinub, which, however, I do not\r\nvouch for, is that Mithridates, the Greek emperor, put his wives and\r\nsisters to death with his own hands in the palace whose ruins we saw\r\none morning to prevent their falling into the hands of Lucullus and his\r\nRoman invaders.\r\n\r\nThere is much to see in all these little towns in the way of ruins, but\r\nthe difficulty is that nobody can tell you anything about them. They\r\nare not esteemed by the people and no archæologist has ever undertaken\r\nto investigate them. They represent successive civilizations, first\r\nGreek, then Roman, then Persian and Venetian, and, finally, the\r\nByzantine periods of occupation and culture, each of which was founded\r\nupon the fragments of those which preceded it. No country has had so\r\nmuch history, but it is impossible to fix dates or circumstances. Asia\r\nMinor and that coast have been in the midst of the current of events\r\nfrom the beginning of things. Every great conqueror has occupied\r\nthat country in turn, down to the final invasion of the Turks, whose\r\nsupremacy was established in the fifteenth century and has been\r\nmaintained ever since.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to adjust ourselves to the realization that the little\r\ntowns where we went ashore as the steamer stopped are the same that\r\nwere occupied by Alexander the Great, by Cyrus, Darius and Timour the\r\nTartar, and it is asserted that there are traces of every one of them\r\nthere. But those communities have seen many changes since. That coast\r\nhas been a thoroughfare for conquerors, because of its geographical\r\nposition--a battle field for many, but the abiding place of none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT CITY OF TREBIZOND\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember, when a boy, seeing one of Offenbach’s comic operas entitled\r\n“The Princess of Trebizond,” the plot of which, I supposed, was pure\r\nfiction; but, since looking into things, it seems entirely probable\r\nthat the main incidents actually occurred when Trebizond was an empire\r\nand a despot known as the “Grand Comnenus” ruled over that quaint,\r\nlittle, old town and the country that surrounds it. The ruins of the\r\npalaces the rulers occupied and the fortifications which they built\r\nto defend their capital still remain, and it is difficult to conceive\r\nanything more picturesque than the ancient walls and towers covered\r\nwith ivy and other creeping vines. The Turks have utilized a good part\r\nof them, and from the deck of the ship we saw the ugly mouths of cannon\r\nyawning at us from the top of a castle that is at least one thousand,\r\nand perhaps fifteen hundred years old. The central part of the little\r\ncity, where the Moslem population lives, is still partly enclosed by\r\nthe old wall, while the Christian population live outside.\r\n\r\nTrebizond is older than Rome. It was founded by a colony of Greeks from\r\nthe neighbouring town of Sinope in the year 756 B.C., while Rome was\r\nnot founded until three years later, in 753. But even the good people\r\nof Trebizond will admit that Rome is a little ahead of their own town\r\nat present. After the Romans drove out the Greeks the emperor Trajan\r\nmade Trebizond the capital of the province of Cappadocia, and Hadrian\r\nbuilt the harbour, which wasn’t a very good job, for the anchorage\r\nis so unsafe that in stormy weather the ships have to pull up anchor\r\nand run to Platena, seven miles westward, for safety. There is an\r\nunfinished pier and custom house, which our captain said had been\r\nbuilding a hundred years and would not be finished for another hundred,\r\naccording to the way the Turks do things. Just now passengers and cargo\r\nare handled at a small iron pier extending beyond the breakers, and it\r\nis a nasty place for people to land.\r\n\r\nThe Roman emperor, Justinian, built the original castle and gave the\r\ncity its water supply, but most of the ruins date from the empire\r\nwhich was founded in 1204 by Alexius I, grandson of the Byzantine\r\nemperor, Andronicus I, who assumed the title of “Grand Comnenus.”\r\nAlexius had twenty successors and the empire lasted until 1461. In\r\nthe meantime Trebizond, according to the historians, “was famed for\r\nits magnificence, the court for its luxury and elaborate ceremonials,\r\nwhile at the same time it was frequently a hotbed of intrigue and\r\nimmorality.” The imperial family were renowned for their beauty,\r\nand the princesses were sought as brides not only by the Byzantine\r\nemperors, but by the Moslem rulers of Persia and the chiefs of\r\nthe Mongols and Turkomans. The Grand Comneni were patrons of art\r\nand learning; the library of the palace was filled with valuable\r\nmanuscripts; and the city was adorned with splendid buildings. The\r\nwriters of that time speak with enthusiasm of its lofty towers, of\r\nthe churches and monasteries in its suburbs, and especially of the\r\ngardens, orchards, and olive groves.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe all this, but the ruins are there, and the\r\nmute walls of crumbling stone would probably confirm the statements if\r\nthey could speak. There is an enormous monastery in ruins at the top of\r\na hill, which is said to have played an important part in the history\r\nof the city and was the scene of a crisis which ended the empire. There\r\nis an old church in the suburbs which dates back nearly a thousand\r\nyears and contains the tombs of several of the emperors of Trebizond\r\nand a monument to Solomon, one of the early kings of the neighbouring\r\nstate of Georgia, now a Russian province.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles west of the town is the Church of St. Sophia, which\r\nwas built eight hundred years ago, and must have been a magnificent\r\nstructure, judging from what remains. It has been a mosque for several\r\ncenturies, but is seldom used these days. The pavement of many-coloured\r\nmarble is very beautiful, and the walls are decorated with pictures in\r\nmosaic, like those in the mosques of Salonika, although the vandals\r\nhave covered them with whitewash because they represent Christian\r\nsaints and martyrs. In the vestibule, until 1843, was a fine fresco\r\nrepresenting the emperor Alexius, his mother, the dowager Irene, and\r\nhis wife, the empress Theodora, all clad in their imperial robes, but\r\nit mysteriously disappeared while the church was being repaired and has\r\nnever been recovered. There are other relics of ancient times which one\r\nwould like to know more about, but there was no one to tell us, and the\r\narchæologists have neglected this part of the world.\r\n\r\nTo a historical student, perhaps, the most interesting fact about\r\nTrebizond is that it was the end of the masterly retreat of the famous\r\n“Ten Thousand” under command of Xenophon, a newspaper man, whose story\r\nis told in the Anabasis. Every school-boy who has ever studied Greek\r\nknows more or less about it.\r\n\r\nDarius, the great king of Persia, had two sons, Artaxerxes and Cyrus.\r\nThe latter was not satisfied with the division of the kingdom and 400\r\nB.C. organized an army in Greece and marched against his brother at\r\nBabylon. Xenophon accompanied the expedition as a war correspondent.\r\nWhen Cyrus was killed, his barbaric troops scattered, leaving ten\r\nthousand Greek mercenaries who had accompanied him to look after\r\nthemselves in a desert between the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers.\r\nTheir commanders became rattled and lay down, whereupon Xenophon showed\r\nwhat newspaper men are capable of doing when responsibility falls upon\r\nthem, by assuming command, reorganizing the force, and leading it back\r\nthrough an unknown country with marvellous skill. He had never served\r\nas a soldier, but like every other newspaper man was a master of the\r\nscience of war.\r\n\r\nThe retreat of the “Ten Thousand” is one of the greatest military\r\nachievements in history, for, although he had no supplies and was\r\ncompelled to forage on the people, and no knowledge of the geography\r\nor topography of the country, Xenophon conducted the “Ten Thousand”\r\nacross Armenia and over the mountains to Trebizond, where the settlers\r\nreceived him with generous hospitality and assisted him to obtain boats\r\nto carry his soldiers back to Greece.\r\n\r\nThe American consul at Trebizond has a beautiful house with a terrace,\r\nand a view that is worth a fortune, and our government ought to buy it\r\nwhile it is possible, because there are very few houses suitable for\r\na consulate in Trebizond and they are in great demand. Other nations\r\nown the houses that their consuls occupy and the United States ought\r\nto be equally prudent. The present consul is Dr. Milo A. Jewett, who\r\nwas born in Turkey, the son of an American missionary, but was educated\r\nand practised medicine in Massachusetts until he came into the consular\r\nservice many years ago.\r\n\r\nThere is an American school there also, in charge of Dr. L. S. Crawford\r\nof North Adams, Mass., who is doing great work under the direction of\r\nthe American Board of Foreign Missions by educating young Trebizonians.\r\nAll the students obtain a good knowledge of English, and their advanced\r\ncourses are taken through the medium of that language.\r\n\r\nTrebizond was the first mission station occupied east of Constantinople\r\non the Black Sea. Thomas P. Johnson, the first American missionary,\r\ntook up his residence there in 1835. The nearest mission station is\r\nat Erzroom, six days’ journey to the south, over extensive ranges of\r\nmountains and on one of the upper branches of the Euphrates River. The\r\nterritory directly connected with this important city has a population\r\nof about 800,000 Mohammedans, 120,000 Greeks, and 32,000 Armenians.\r\nThe city itself has a population of only 56,000, being now nearly four\r\ntimes as large as it was seventy-five years ago.\r\n\r\nNo large educational institution or important medical work has been\r\nbuilt up in Trebizond, not because of the want of need or opportunity,\r\nbut because it has not been possible to find a force sufficient for\r\nthe other missions. The work carried on by Doctor and Mrs. Crawford,\r\nin the city itself, has been largely among the Armenians, while\r\nOrdoun, a large city on the Black Sea, west of Trebizond, has been\r\nthe headquarters of a mission for the Greeks. As Trebizond is so near\r\nthe Russian border and so accessible by water for all that part of\r\nRussia, there has been a most urgent call during the last few years for\r\ninstitutions there to meet the demands of the Russian young men who are\r\nseeking a modern education, but have no facilities for it in their own\r\ncountry. Many Russians go to the mission high school in Trebizond and\r\nit is evident that if a strong educational institution could be started\r\nthere, it would have a wide patronage from the Russian coast of the\r\nBlack Sea and from the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nThe city of Erzroom is situated on a high plateau six days inland\r\nfrom Trebizond. It stands at an elevation of some six thousand feet\r\nabove the sea, and at the same time is surrounded by mountains rising\r\na thousand or more feet above the plain. The most northerly branch\r\nof the Euphrates River rises to the eastward and flows down through\r\nthe plain a little below the city. In times of drought this is only a\r\ntrickling stream, but in the wet season it becomes a river of no small\r\nproportions. The city is one of the most important in the Turkish\r\nEmpire, in that it is only about twelve hours’ journey from the\r\nRussian border. At the time of the Russo-Turkish war in 1878, it was\r\noccupied by the Russians for some time, until, through the pressure\r\nof the Powers, they were compelled to withdraw, and to their great\r\ndisappointment the line between the two countries was established to\r\nthe eastward and left it still a part of Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe mountains about the city are fortified by the Turks, and the city\r\nitself is enclosed in earthworks, the entrances being through guarded\r\npassage ways and heavy gates, to be shut in times of attack. Because of\r\nthe strategic importance of the post, the Turkish governor is usually a\r\nman of large military experience. It is believed that should war break\r\nout between Turkey and Russia, and it may happen at any time, Erzroom\r\nwould be the first point of attack. For the same reason the great\r\nEuropean Powers maintain in Trebizond consuls of unusual ability, and\r\nnot infrequently these consuls have had extensive military experience.\r\n\r\nErzroom, like most of the large cities of interior Turkey, is the\r\ncentre of a great number of smaller cities and villages scattered\r\nover the far-stretching plain and into the ravines of the mountains.\r\nThere is a large Kurdish population to the south and east of Erzroom,\r\nwhich presents in itself a considerable problem. Erzroom itself has\r\nfor many years been the headquarters of an army corps of the Turkish\r\nEmpire, maintained there particularly to keep order among the various\r\nantagonistic races, especially the Kurds, and particularly to guard the\r\nfrontier against undue aggression on the part of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe people of Erzroom and vicinity, like mountain people generally, are\r\nunusually hardy and vigorous, with a large degree of independence. The\r\ncity itself, so far as wealth is concerned, is hardly surpassed by any\r\nof the interior cities of Turkey. Its merchants go all over the empire,\r\nand as a centre of trade with Persia as well as with Europe Erzroom\r\nholds a unique place.\r\n\r\nSince the city was occupied as a mission station in 1840, many\r\ndistracting events have occurred, such as the war of 1877–78, when\r\nit was taken by the Russians and, following the siege, was sorely\r\nafflicted by the plague. One of the American missionaries, Rev. Royal\r\nM. Cole, D.D., then in Erzroom, went to the front with the army to care\r\nfor the wounded and the suffering, and gave himself wholly to this\r\nwork so long as the war lasted, devoting himself to the sick after the\r\nRussian troops had withdrawn. Two of his own children died from the\r\nplague at that time. Again in 1895 Erzroom came within the massacre\r\nbelt and suffered greatly from the attacks upon the Christians by the\r\nTurks and Kurds.\r\n\r\nBeside the evangelistic activity, two lines of work have been developed\r\nat Erzroom that have had great influence and won the approbation of\r\nTurkish officials: namely, education and medical relief for both men\r\nand women. An American nurse, left in charge of the missionary hospital\r\nin the absence of the missionary physician who went home on furlough,\r\nwas invited by the military authorities to take charge of the military\r\nhospital, which she did, and was there brought into direct contact\r\nwith Turkish soldiers. This is the first time, to my knowledge, that\r\na Christian missionary nurse, at the invitation of army officials,\r\nwas ever identified with the staff of a Mohammedan hospital or given\r\nunhampered freedom in contact with Mohammedans. Her ministrations were\r\nmost gratefully received and by her example she removed from the minds\r\nof many Moslems deep-seated prejudices against Christianity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dr. Stapleton, a trained lady physician of unusual skill and tact,\r\nhas had access during many years to the homes of the high Turkish\r\nofficials, where she meets with a cordial welcome. She has no hospital,\r\nbut does her medical work almost wholly by visitation in the homes,\r\nand largely the homes of the officials. It takes time to break down\r\nthe prejudices of honest Mohammedan believers, many of whom have a\r\nconviction that Christianity is an inferior religion and that those who\r\nprofess it lack the moral virtues. These opinions cannot be changed by\r\nargument or by preaching, and only by that close personal contact that\r\na physician may have with his patients in their homes during periods\r\nof protracted illness. This, of all the methods of missionary work, is\r\nmost effective. It does not show results that can be tabulated; but\r\nnevertheless is far-reaching in its influence and power, and ultimately\r\nwill accomplish much by changing the attitude of those who have\r\nbelieved that there is nothing good in Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe school work in Erzroom does not differ from that at Sivas and\r\nTrebizond. There are boarding-schools for both young men and young\r\nwomen, always separate, as they must be in the Turkish Empire. The\r\nimportance of the boarding-school as a missionary force can hardly\r\nbe over-estimated. Into these schools young men and young women are\r\nbrought, often from rude homes and not infrequently from homes that\r\nexert a demoralizing and harmful influence upon the children. The\r\nboarding-school is so arranged that it becomes a new home to the\r\npupils. They are surrounded by wholesome influences. Their minds are\r\nconstantly stimulated to activity and they are led unconsciously to\r\nadopt American methods and helpful ideas. Children coming from a\r\ndistance often remain the entire year under these influences before\r\nreturning to their homes. Sometimes employment is given them during the\r\nvacation months so that they stay longer. One can readily imagine the\r\nchange that takes place in a young man or young woman who has never\r\nbefore been out of one of the rude villages after a year or two of this\r\nrefining experience and inspiring instruction.\r\n\r\nWhen these young people return to their homes the change that has taken\r\nplace in them makes a profound impression upon the entire village. The\r\nvalue of education is promptly recognized, and often one pupil from a\r\ndistrict in the interior of the country will be the means of bringing\r\ndozens of others to the school, sent by parents who, ambitious for\r\ntheir children, wish for them the same kind of education and to see in\r\nthem the same advance that has appeared in the child of a neighbour.\r\nOne does not need to use his imagination to see how the entire villages\r\nand communities are elevated through a single pupil who has spent,\r\nit may be, no more than a couple of years in an American mission\r\nboarding-school in some remote city and who, upon his return, not only\r\nexercises a silent influence for education and morals, but may at once\r\nopen a school for the children of his own village.\r\n\r\nThis represents, in a simple way, something of the influence and\r\npower of the missionary boarding-school upon the region in which it\r\nis located. While time is required for the full exercise of this\r\ninfluence, and while the lines can only in the remotest degree ever be\r\ntraced, it is found that they are far-reaching and fundamental. These\r\nschools also prepare students for college. The graduates of the two\r\nhigh schools at Erzroom have gone chiefly to the colleges at Harpoot,\r\nMarsovan, and Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe city of Sivas, in Asia Minor, was occupied by the Americans as\r\na mission station in 1851. It is located on the old caravan road\r\nextending from Samsoun, through Tokat and Amasia, an eight days’\r\njourney by camel, but now covered easily in six days by the Turkish\r\nArabs. It is on the route of the proposed American railroad now under\r\ndiscussion, which is expected to extend eastward into Mamurettaul-Aziz,\r\nin the vilayet of Harpoot, and so on southward.\r\n\r\nSivas is noted among archæologists for its ruins of the Seljuko, an\r\nancient Persian dynasty, some of which reveal in their fragments the\r\nsplendour of the structure of which they formed a part. The city is in\r\nthe midst of a large and fertile plain, and is the central market for a\r\nwide area. It was selected as a location for missionary work because of\r\nits strategic position on the caravan road, and its large and thrifty\r\npopulation, which is composed of Turks, Kurds, Greeks, and Armenians.\r\n\r\nOne of the first missionaries sent into that country was a physician,\r\nDoctor West, who, by his successful practice, and, to them, astounding\r\nsurgical operations, won a reputation which stands to-day unsurpassed\r\neven so far as the remote villages of the mountains of that district.\r\nThe natives still tell of the miracles which Doctor West performed with\r\nhis surgical instruments, and one can rest assured that these stories\r\nhave lost nothing as they have passed on into the second generation and\r\nare still doing service in support of scientific medicine. They made it\r\ndifficult for a modern physician to live up to the reputation of the\r\nfirst missionary doctor seen in that region. As might be expected, this\r\nwork, at once recognized as of such importance, has been maintained\r\nand an American physician is now located at Sivas with a hospital and\r\ndispensary.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Doctor West there were no missionary hospitals, and the\r\ndispensary usually consisted of a cupboard in a corner of the doctor’s\r\noffice, or more frequently of saddle bags from which he drew according\r\nto his needs on his journeys up and down the country. The first\r\nmissionary physicians were itinerants with no office hours, but ready\r\nwhenever and wherever called to render relief to the sick and suffering\r\nto the limit of their power. Under the changes that have taken place\r\nsince those days, the physician naturally and rightfully demands a\r\nplace in which he can care for patients who are seriously ill or after\r\nsurgical operations, until danger is passed.\r\n\r\nThere was no hospital in Sivas until six years ago, when a small\r\nhouse was hired with four beds in it. After passing through various\r\nchanges, it is now equipped with twenty beds, with a royal permit from\r\nConstantinople which puts it upon a legal and recognized basis. The\r\nphysician in charge, Charles E. Clark, M.D., has a trained nurse as an\r\nassistant. The patients who avail themselves of their services range\r\nall the way from the beggar on the street to the wealthy government\r\nofficial. Turkish Moslems, Circassian soldiers, Kurds, Armenians, all\r\ncome to the American doctor and the American dispensary and hospital,\r\nwhen suffering. The hospital is crowded to such extent that it must be\r\nenlarged to accommodate not only the hospital patients, but the clinics\r\nin the dispensary. The demands which press upon the physician cannot\r\nbe met with the present equipment. Over five thousand patients were\r\ntreated in the year 1910.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the colleges administered by American missionaries in Turkey\r\nhave passed out of the first period of their history, that of laying\r\nfoundations, and have entered on a period of expansion. One hundred\r\nand thirteen high schools and boarding-schools which are the feeders\r\nfor the colleges, have hitherto lacked the attention and the money\r\nnecessary for their best development, but now that they are firmly\r\nestablished more attention is being given to the lower schools, without\r\nwhich the colleges cannot do their best work. Several of these high\r\nschools are the educational centres of territory larger in extent and\r\ncontaining a greater population than some of our American states.\r\n\r\nThe Sivas Normal School, located in the heart of Sivas, a city of\r\n65,000 people, and the capital of the ancient Seljuks, is a good\r\nexample, and until recently was unique in Turkey in the attention it\r\ngives to training teachers for the common schools.\r\n\r\nMore than twenty-five years ago, the American missionaries, because\r\nof the increasing need of more and better prepared teachers, decided\r\nto strengthen a common school which was being carried on under their\r\ndirection and to raise the standard to that of a high school. The\r\nname Sivas Normal School was given to it at that time to represent\r\nthe consciousness of the need and the purpose. Those who laid the\r\nfoundations were Rev. Henry T. Perry, who is still connected with the\r\nschool, and Rev. Albert W. Hubbard. Whatever has been accomplished\r\nsince in making the school a more effective and wider agency for\r\nChristian education has been built on the foundation which they laid.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen years ago, when a striking increase of interest in\r\neducation began to appear in the Sivas field, two men of exceptional\r\nability as teachers became associated in its management. Mr. Baliosian,\r\na graduate of the normal school, returned after completing his course\r\nof study in Central Turkey College, and soon Mr. Kabakjian came from\r\nAnatolia College to join him. Many good ideas and influences from these\r\ntwo strong colleges were thus introduced into the normal school and it\r\nwas due in no small degree to the coöperation of these two men that it\r\nbegan to progress rapidly. The number of students grew in a few years\r\nfrom twenty-five to one hundred and thirty, greatly overcrowding the\r\nbuilding which had been enlarged to its fullest possible capacity.\r\n\r\nThe educational system which has been developed by the missionaries in\r\nSivas now includes about four thousand pupils, of whom nine hundred\r\nare in the city under their direct care; two thirds are in the lower\r\ngrades; four hundred and thirty are boys, of whom about one hundred are\r\nin the normal school.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish officials are making strenuous efforts to establish a\r\nthorough compulsory educational system for all classes of Ottoman\r\nsubjects. They are having the same difficulty that China experienced\r\na few years ago when that government set about to build up a\r\ncomprehensive system of education for her people and could not find\r\nteachers competent to do the work required. There has been a great\r\nreaction in China for that reason, and New Turkey is now facing exactly\r\nthe same problem. The minister of public instruction and his associates\r\nare convinced that there must be a system of general education in\r\nTurkey in order to make constitutional and representative government\r\nsafe and stable. And how are they to secure teachers with proper\r\ntraining to make them competent for the work? The Turkish schools\r\nhitherto have not provided them, and the American colleges, although\r\nfilled with students for the last twenty years, have not been able\r\nto turn out more than a fraction of the number required to supply the\r\nTurkish national schools, to say nothing of the demands of private\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nTo aid in meeting these demands a normal school has been established\r\nat Sivas and is preparing to give a thorough modern training to young\r\nmen who are fitting themselves for the profession of teacher. For all\r\nsuch there is a future full of promise. The American Board purchased\r\na fine site just outside the city and is now endeavouring to secure\r\nfunds to complete a commodious and attractive building to accommodate\r\nthe number of ambitious students knocking at its doors. If this school\r\nwere equipped to train a thousand young men and to send out annually\r\ntwo hundred graduates with the most complete normal training that could\r\nbe given them in a course of five years, it would not begin to meet the\r\ndemand that New Turkey is placing upon it at the present time.\r\n\r\nYou must not forget that a large proportion of the people of Turkey\r\nare villagers, uneducated and unambitious, but full of possibilities\r\nif properly trained. It is to meet the needs of this intelligent but\r\nuntrained village population that the normal school exists. It is\r\nexpected that the government schools will take all the graduates and\r\nset them to work as rapidly as they can be prepared for it. Wherever\r\nthese teachers are sent in the villages of Turkey, they will be the\r\nbest educated men of the entire region, and their influence will be\r\ntremendous for peace, order, progress, education, and for the building\r\nup of a new society on the basis of Western Christian civilization.\r\nSchool committees in these villages, priests and bishops of the old\r\nchurches, are clamouring for teachers. The success of constitutional\r\ngovernment depends upon raising the general level of thought and\r\ncharacter, and all this depends upon the supply of proper teachers.\r\n\r\nThe studies provided are the ordinary American course for normal\r\ntraining, including the theory and practice of teaching and school\r\nmanagement, lectures on the common branches by speakers of experience,\r\nand a considerable amount of practice teaching under proper\r\nsupervision. A year’s course in pedagogy is also given.\r\n\r\nAmerican missionaries tell me that the education of women has been\r\na critical subject of discussion among the inhabitants of Sivas and\r\nthat part of Turkey. In the interior provinces it has been the common\r\nbelief that women cannot learn to read under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances; in intellectual ability it was customary to class them\r\nwith animals. Not infrequently in conversation with men of the last\r\ngeneration the statement would be made that a girl could no more\r\nlearn to read than a donkey, and at any rate, of what possible use\r\nin the world could a reading woman be? It was often asserted that,\r\nif women learned to read, the whole fabric of Turkish society would\r\nbe overturned, since they would become independent, would be liable\r\nto talk back when beaten by their husbands, and make trouble for the\r\nfamily and the community. It was the general opinion that it was safer\r\nto leave women in ignorance, even if the point should be conceded\r\nthat they were capable of learning anything under the most favourable\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe first missionaries who went into the country fought these theories\r\ndown, largely by hiring girls to attend school in order to demonstrate\r\nthe fact that they can learn to read. The girls of Turkey are as bright\r\nas those of any country, and generally the languages of Turkey are\r\neasier to learn than English, so that in every case the missionary won.\r\nHe was careful to select bright girls for the tests, and in no instance\r\nwas there a failure. They demonstrated that it was possible for a girl\r\nto learn to read and that in very quick time. A little group of ten\r\ngirls was gathered into a school in Sivas away back in 1864, and from\r\nthat time to this the education of this sex has not been neglected.\r\nIn two years that little school had thirty-two pupils. It became so\r\npopular that the Armenian bishop twice anathematized the school and its\r\nteachers, but that only tended to advertise it and the number of pupils\r\nrapidly increased.\r\n\r\nThe present High School for Girls, which had only four pupils in\r\n1874 and was located in an old native house, has attained extensive\r\ninfluence and power, not only through the pupils themselves, but\r\nthrough the five hundred and sixty girls in various other schools in\r\nthe city, all of which are affiliated with this high school, and those\r\nin other cities, like Gurum, Tokat, Divrik, Endires, Zara, etc., where\r\nall the teachers are its graduates. What is perhaps of equal importance\r\nis that the Gregorian priests have founded and are now carrying on\r\nsimilar schools for girls in many of the centres of population in the\r\nvilayet, in which the American methods have been adopted, American\r\ncourses are taught, and American ideas about the education of women are\r\naccepted and are in practical operation. This recognition of missionary\r\nmethods is as sincere as it is general; an imitation is the most\r\ngenuine endorsement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the medical and educational work it has been necessary\r\nfor the American missionaries, especially in the interior towns of\r\nTurkey, during the last fifteen years, to open orphanages for the\r\naccommodation of the great number of children that have been left\r\nwholly destitute by the frequent massacres. This began in 1895, at the\r\ntime of the great massacres which swept over so much of the Turkish\r\nEmpire, when more than three hundred children were gathered into\r\nan orphanage in Sivas. Our missionaries were aided by helpers sent\r\nout from Switzerland under a Swiss committee, so that the work has\r\nbecome international in its character. These children have been given\r\ncomfortable Christian homes and a modern education. It became necessary\r\nto introduce many forms of industry for them that they might not be\r\nidle and to enable them to bear at least a part of the expense of their\r\nsupport and schooling. Later this work was enlarged somewhat to include\r\nrelief for widows.\r\n\r\nAs missionary enterprises, all these lines of work are connected with\r\ngeneral Christian instruction in no way hostile to the belief and\r\nthoughts of the people. The instruction given has been constructive and\r\nhelpful rather than destructive and combative.\r\n\r\nTrebizond is the terminus of the northern caravan route from Persia,\r\nand about 30 per cent. of the commerce of the city is carried back and\r\nforth on camels. The road over which the caravans travel is the same\r\nthat Xenophon followed in the retreat of the “Ten Thousand,” and it has\r\nbeen kept in fairly good condition all these centuries, although it is\r\nscarcely fit for vehicles. In former years about twenty thousand camels\r\narrived annually at Trebizond, each carrying from four hundred to five\r\nhundred pounds. So much of the trade has been diverted through the\r\nCaucasus by the new Russian road from Teheran to Rescht and the railway\r\nthrough the Caucasus, that not more than eight thousand to ten thousand\r\ncamels are employed at present.\r\n\r\nThe distances between the principal points along the caravan route are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n                                                  Miles\r\n  From Trebizond to Erzroom                         198\r\n  Erzroom to the Persian frontier                   156\r\n  Persian frontier to Tabriz                        162\r\n  Tabriz to Teheran                                 344\r\n                                                    ---\r\n        Total distance from Trebizond to Teheran    860\r\n\r\nThe caravans usually take sixty days for the journey each way,\r\ntwenty-four days from Trebizond to the frontier and thirty-six days\r\nfrom the frontier to Teheran.\r\n\r\nFormerly travellers for Teheran used to go that way and made the\r\njourney upon swift-moving camels in about twenty days. The route to\r\nPersia via the steamers on the Black Sea to Batoum, the railway across\r\nthe Caucasus, and steamers on the Caspian Sea is quicker, shorter, and\r\ncheaper, and hence the trade goes that way.\r\n\r\nThe caravans stop at a khan (as the old-fashioned hotels are called\r\nwhere entertainment is given to both man and beast), just outside of\r\nTrebizond, and we went down there to see the camels and their drivers.\r\nTwo hundred camels had just arrived from Persia after a journey of\r\nthirty days, bringing twelve hundred bags of rice. I talked with the\r\nboss driver, a gigantic Persian with a broad, cheerful face, who told\r\nme that he had never been anywhere but along the same route between\r\nTabriz and Trebizond, and had travelled that regularly two or three\r\ntimes a year for more than twenty years. Caravans often went to Tibet\r\nand as far as China, he said, but he had never been that far.\r\n\r\nThe camels used on this line are a common species of dromedary with\r\nonly one hump, and cost all the way from $50 to $150 each, according\r\nto age and condition. There is no regular system of camel-breeding\r\nin Asia Minor, although that animal is the only beast of burden and\r\nis absolutely indispensable. Most of the animals used here come from\r\nArabia, where they are bred by the Bedouins, and at the age of three\r\nyears are broken to load. The strength of a camel begins to decline at\r\ntwenty years, and after he reaches twenty-five he is not worth much. An\r\nordinary caravan is made up of groups of seven camels in charge of one\r\nman, who leads them, feeds them, and cares for them from the time he\r\nis twenty years old until they all die together. A camel driver has no\r\nhome. He is a nomad. He never has anything but the clothes he wears. He\r\nsleeps with one of his camels for a pillow, and it might be said that\r\nhe eats the same food, which consists of straw and beans. A caravan is\r\nusually led by a little donkey, for camels, as well as human beings,\r\nwill follow donkeys wherever they may go, in a most mysterious manner.\r\n\r\nA camel is never relieved of its load from the beginning to the end of\r\na journey. It eats, sleeps, and travels under its burden, often for\r\nweeks at a time, and will carry six hundred pounds without a murmur.\r\nWhen the load is off, the driver rides, but when the load is on he\r\nwalks by the side of his charge.\r\n\r\nCamels are used for all kinds of purposes, the same as horses. They\r\nare broken to saddle and to wagon. They are hitched to plows and haul\r\nsaw logs out of the forests. They can go for ten days over a desert\r\nwithout water. Their stomachs are divided into compartments and the\r\ncontents are digested in order, one after the other, as the system\r\nneeds nourishment. And it is often said that a “fifth stomach” is kept\r\nas a reserve for an emergency.\r\n\r\nOur word caravansary comes from the Turkish term caravanseria, which\r\nmeans literally a bower for caravans, or a resting place where the\r\nanimals are fed and the camel driver eats his bread and drinks his\r\nwine. He gets nothing and pays for nothing except space, shelter, and\r\nprotection against robbers and thieves. These caravanserias are found\r\nin every town along the caravan roads. They are distinguished from\r\nkhans--which are usually square enclosures or court-yards paved with\r\nstone, with rooms opening upon them, where travellers can store their\r\ngoods, and often a gallery and a second floor, where the better class\r\ncan obtain lodgings. These khans may be found in Constantinople and\r\nin every other Eastern city, and in the day-time are busy places, the\r\nfreighters loading and unloading and merchants showing their goods to\r\ncustomers. At sunset the gates are closed, the donkeys and the animals\r\nlie down to sleep, and their drivers lie down beside them.\r\n\r\nThere is a long range of snow-clad mountains along the southern coast\r\nof the Black Sea reaching almost the entire distance from Trebizond\r\nto Rizeh, the next stopping place, and between them and the water\r\nside are low foothills covered with farms. The new wheat was a vivid\r\ngreen that lights up a lovely picture. There is no more beautiful sea\r\ncoast. Indeed, there is nothing to surpass that landscape in the Alps,\r\nor the Pyrenees, or the Andes, or the Rocky Mountains, or anywhere\r\nelse, owing to the great variety of scenery that lies between the\r\nwater and the snow-capped crags. In May, when we were there, nature is\r\nall smiles. Both the woods and the fields are alive with glory. The\r\nfoliage is perfect; rhododendrons and azaleas hide the scars in the\r\nrocks and creepers drape the rugged cliffs with a profusion of garlands\r\nthat artificial decorations cannot compare with. Here and there the\r\nfarming land is broken by a lofty precipice rising a thousand feet or\r\nmore directly out of luxuriant vegetation, just as an artist would put\r\nsome bold figure into a picture to offer a contrast to the peaceful,\r\ncultivated slope. And the lofty mountain peaks look bolder and sterner\r\nbecause they rise so near the wheat fields, the gentle valleys dotted\r\nwith white villages, and the sombre forests that are so thick and so\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nWe were told that the finest oranges, cherries, and other fruits in the\r\nworld come from the slopes that line the shore of the Black Sea. We\r\nwere told, too, that cherries got their name from the town of Kerasun,\r\nwhich was called Cherryson by the Greeks. We were too early, of course,\r\nfor all the fruits except oranges, but the captain said that in the\r\nsummer and fall cherries, grapes, plums, peaches, pears, and melons,\r\nfiner than can be found in Paris, “can be bought for almost nothing.”\r\n\r\nThe people of the villages on that part of the coast, and particularly\r\nthose of the town of Rizeh, are sailors and fishermen. They are wild,\r\nreckless, handsome fellows, wearing short open jackets of scarlet or\r\nblue, with zouave trousers, purple or yellow sashes bound around their\r\nwaists, and a knotted black turban with the tasselled ends hanging down\r\nover their shoulders. Most of the seamen on the Turkish cruisers and\r\ngunboats come from that town and the neighbouring villages.\r\n\r\n“Rizeh is the most beautiful place on the Black Sea,” said the captain\r\nwith a shrug, “but everybody carries a knife, and would not hesitate to\r\nkill a stranger for his hat or his handkerchief.”\r\n\r\nAnd we learned afterward that there were two hundred murderers serving\r\nsentences of from fifteen years to life in the prison that day. We\r\nsaw several of the short-sentence men at the windows as we passed the\r\nprison, and somebody was standing on a tomb in the cemetery under the\r\nwindows talking to them in a loud tone. The people on the street did\r\nnot appear to pay any attention to him, although he was very much in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\nNear by was a more interesting crowd. Our steamer brought the mail from\r\nConstantinople and fifty or sixty citizens of Rizeh were gathered in a\r\ncompact body around the steps of the post-office, while some gentleman\r\nread the news aloud to them. We were told it was a regular practice\r\nevery time a mail came in. Most of the population are illiterate,\r\nbut they are intensely patriotic and partisan, and keep close tab on\r\npolitical events at Constantinople and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThey must be very superstitious, also, judging by the precautions they\r\nadopt to protect their houses and fields from the evil eye and other\r\nuncanny influences. The skull of a goat or a sheep, with a bunch of red\r\npeppers attached to it, was hanging from the corner of the eaves of\r\nalmost every dwelling. We saw similar amulets in the gardens, orchards,\r\nand fields to protect the fruit and the crops. An old shoe and a bunch\r\nof garlic are equally efficacious, we are told, if you haven’t the\r\nskull of a sheep. The peasants in the country believe in miraculous\r\ncures, in witchcraft, and all such things, and often sacrifice animals\r\nat the shrines of saints to fulfil vows they have made in times of\r\ndanger or distress. On a certain day in summer they splash water over\r\neach other; in the spring every woman releases a pigeon she has kept\r\nduring the winter, and in some places the women go out to welcome the\r\nstorks which fly in here at a certain time of the year. A new baby is\r\nalways passed over a flame and young girls leap through fire to insure\r\ngood husbands.\r\n\r\nThe patriarchal system prevails very generally among the farmer\r\npeasants, and the father, or after his death the eldest son, is the\r\nhead and dictator of the family. A newly married couple always go to\r\nlive in the house of the groom’s father, and the bride is condemned to\r\nperpetual silence in the presence of the family until her first child\r\nis born or until another marriage takes place in the same house. A\r\nyoung wife is not permitted to speak to any one save her own husband,\r\nand to him only when they are alone. But after her first baby is born\r\nshe is considered worthy of sufficient respect to be recognized as a\r\nmember of the household.\r\n\r\nAlthough this practice doubtless would not be encouraged by the\r\nDaughters of the Revolution or the suffragettes, nevertheless, every\r\none will admit that it has its advantages. I have read the wise\r\ncomments of a certain Baron Haxthausen, a learned German who spent\r\nsome time in that country forty or fifty years ago and saw many things\r\nto approve. The herr professor must have had some painful matrimonial\r\nexperience, for he commended this custom as tending to increase the\r\npeace of a family as well as conjugal devotion. He is very positive\r\nthat its adoption in other countries would reduce the business of the\r\ndivorce courts and promote the peace and happiness of mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group of Lazis, Armenia, ready for a dance]\r\n\r\n“Imagine five or six women living together in the same house,” he\r\nsays, “and a new member added to the company with the pride and vanity\r\nwhich are usually felt by a bride. Should we not anticipate continued\r\ndissension which the authority in the head of the family is unable to\r\nprevent? Much unhappiness and quarrelling arise from the use of women’s\r\ntongues, and what is so certain a cure as silence? It is only in the\r\nrarest cases that a bride submits gracefully to the opinion and the\r\nauthority of her mother-in-law. She usually enters the family with a\r\ndisposition to assert her independence, and if her freedom of speech is\r\nrestrained, this cannot be done to an extent that will be offensive.\r\nIndeed, I cannot imagine a more wholesome custom than that which\r\nrestrains the conversational powers of a young woman entering a new\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\nIt must be distinctly understood that the above opinions are in\r\nquotation marks, and those who do not agree with them are not\r\ncompelled to act upon the recommendations. And, notwithstanding these\r\nprecautions, you will remember that the prison at Rizeh is full of\r\nmurderers. How many of them are women and how many are brides is not\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nThese people are called Lazis, and this part of Armenia is known as\r\nLazistan. They belong to the Georgian race and came there from Georgia,\r\nwhich lies a little farther along, west of the Caucasus Mountains, in\r\norder to escape persecution from their neighbours because they accepted\r\nthe Mohammedan faith. It sounds refreshing to hear that a Mohammedan\r\nhas been persecuted on religious grounds. It is the first case of the\r\nkind I have ever known, and the Lazis showed their good sense by coming\r\nover into a Mohammedan country after accepting that religion. And they\r\nare said to be very fanatical about it, as converts often are, and will\r\nstab a man for a difference of opinion on theology, as soon as cut\r\nhis throat for his purse. At the same time, they are the most highly\r\nskilled gardeners in all the Ottoman Empire and are conspicuous, under\r\nordinary circumstances, for their quiet, orderly behaviour, for their\r\nindustry, honesty, and fair dealing. We can testify to the last fact,\r\nbecause we always made a bargain with the boatmen who took us ashore\r\nfrom the steamer at every port we stopped, and those at Rizeh are the\r\nonly ones that did not demand more money than they had agreed to accept.\r\n\r\nWith all these virtues, they have been known to dodge their religious\r\nobligations. During the Mohammedan Lent, which is called Ramazan, every\r\nfaithful member of that faith is bound to abstain from all kinds of\r\nnourishment, stimulants, and pleasures between sunrise and sunset; but\r\nthe Lazis continue to smoke all day long on the pretext that tobacco\r\nwas unknown to the prophet Mohammed, and therefore its use could not\r\nhave been forbidden by him.\r\n\r\nAnd so far as persecution is concerned, they have proven very handy\r\nwhen a massacre has been ordered, and no pious Moslem ever cut the\r\nthroat of a Christian or burned his home with so much zeal as they have\r\nshown on several occasions. Nearly all of the Armenian population has\r\nbeen driven back into the country by the fanatical outbreaks of the\r\nLazis, and the Greeks, who were the original settlers and civilizers of\r\nthat coast, have been driven across to the Russian side of the Black\r\nSea, where they can worship in their own way without being interfered\r\nwith. But the whole world will be glad to learn that it is believed\r\nthat religious persecution is at an end in Armenia. No people have ever\r\nsuffered so much or have ever shown greater loyalty and tenacity to the\r\nfaith which they profess.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirteenth, fourteenth, and part of the fifteenth centuries\r\nthe Venetians controlled this coast, and their rivals in the Genoese\r\nRepublic continually attempted to drive them out. Every port was\r\nprotected by a formidable castle and every town was surrounded by\r\na high wall. The Venetian castle at Rizeh has been almost entirely\r\nobliterated, although its site is marked by a pile of débris, and one\r\ncan trace the foundations upon the summit overlooking the bay. The\r\ncity wall is quite perfect in places and can be followed for half a\r\nmile or more on one side of the town. The Venetian influence appears\r\nin a striking manner in the architecture. There are several distinctly\r\nVenetian houses that contribute to the charming picture which this\r\nlittle city embowered in foliage presents from the deck of a ship. And\r\nthe cottages are unique in their designs and methods of construction,\r\nsuggesting the familiar Elizabethan school so common in English\r\nvillages. The walls are made of cross pieces of wood with the spaces\r\nbetween them filled in with masonry, broad roofs, overhanging eaves,\r\nnarrow windows, and loggias.\r\n\r\nEverybody seems to be fond of brilliant colours, which makes the place\r\nlook gay, although the women keep their faces hid and envelop their\r\nbodies in large cotton shawls. They select the gayest patterns they can\r\nfind, which, of course, makes them all the more conspicuous. The guide\r\nbook says that Rizeh is a great place for linen and other fabrics,\r\nand that the women weave their own shawls, but the fashion must have\r\nchanged since the book was written, because we inquired at several of\r\nthe shops and found that all of the dry-goods offered for sale were\r\nmade in Germany, in imitation of the old home-made patterns.\r\n\r\nBatoum, the Colchis of the ancients, where Jason and the Argonauts\r\ncaptured the golden fleece, is the only seaport of the Russian province\r\nof the Caucasus and the only outlet for the trade of that vast and\r\nproductive area. It is the terminus of nearly all the lines of steamers\r\non the Black Sea, and, therefore, a place of great importance. There is\r\na railway across the Caucasus between the Black and the Caspian Seas,\r\na pipe line for conveying oil from Baku and special docks for loading\r\ntank steamers with that kind of freight.\r\n\r\nBatoum was a part of Turkey until the year 1878, and was awarded to\r\nRussia by the Treaty of Berlin, in which the European Powers all\r\nparticipated, as part of the price which Turkey was compelled to pay\r\nfor peace. Since the cession the place has been strongly fortified\r\nby the Russians, notwithstanding a stipulation in that convention\r\nagainst it. There is a population of about thirty thousand, very\r\ncosmopolitan. All the Turkish clans are represented and there are about\r\nsix thousand Greeks. There is an old and a new town. The former is a\r\nduplication of one hundred small Turkish cities with bazaars, mosques,\r\ncafés, and khans, where travellers and caravans find accommodations\r\nfor themselves, their animals, and their merchandise. All of the\r\nlabour is done by Armenians, Georgians, Greeks, Turks, and Circassians\r\nand representatives of a dozen other races, each of which adheres\r\ntenaciously to its native costume as well as its native customs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The city of Batoum]\r\n\r\nThe new town is distinctly Russian, with wide streets, good sidewalks,\r\nand shade trees everywhere. There are two well-kept parks, a boulevard\r\nand promenade along the seashore which is very attractive and must be\r\na great comfort to the population during the long, hot summer months.\r\nThere is a good deal of bathing _au naturel_, the women undressing and\r\ngoing into the water “in the altogether” at one end of the promenade,\r\nand the men at the other, without the formality of bathing-houses,\r\nalthough they might be built at a very slight expense in the interest\r\nof common decency as well as convenience. No other necessity is\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nIt was decidedly pleasant to see the unveiled faces of women again,\r\nafter several weeks in Mohammedan towns; and one never admires blonde\r\nhair and blue eyes, particularly when worn by an American girl, as\r\nhe does after spending some time among Orientals. It was pleasant to\r\nescape the musty smells which are attached to every Turkish town and to\r\nsee healthy, clean dogs that could be touched without contamination.\r\n\r\nBatoum has a splendid cathedral of the solid and ornate Russian\r\nstyle of architecture, with the five domes required by Byzantine\r\ntraditions. It was erected as a memorial several years ago. Somebody,\r\nunfortunately, furnished the cathedral with a peal of heavy, deep-toned\r\nbells, which are ringing nearly all the time and cause a suspension of\r\nbusiness, because nobody can talk or hear or even think in the eruption\r\nof sound they produce. There are good shops, well filled with modern\r\nmerchandise, and a hotel that is quite comfortable, but is kept by a\r\nman whose name might be Barabbas, for he is a robber.\r\n\r\nThe streets and cafés are full of Russian officers and soldiers,\r\nincluding many stately Cossacks wearing tall chimney-pot hats of white\r\nPersian lamb and the many other accoutrements that pertain to that\r\nrace of professional warriors. A Cossack, as perhaps you know, comes\r\nfrom the valley of the river Don, in eastern Russia, where soldiers\r\nare bred, and they go into the Russian army for life, furnishing their\r\nown uniforms, their own horses, and their own arms, as well as their\r\nown rations and supplies, for which they receive a lump sum per month.\r\nThey are doubtless the finest cavalry in the world and are absolutely\r\nloyal to their employers. It is a matter of principle and not a\r\nmatter of partisanship. In all the Russian revolutions, in all the\r\nconspiracies against the czar and the government, no Cossack has ever\r\nbeen corrupted. On the other hand, they are absolutely merciless. They\r\nseem to be entirely without the ordinary feelings of humanity, knowing\r\nneither sympathy nor sorrow, regret nor remorse. They will shoot an\r\ninfant as readily as an armed foe.\r\n\r\nThe Russian drosky, the little baby victoria, so familiar to the\r\nczar’s possessions, which may be found in every town between Riga and\r\nVladivostock, is here at the convenience of the tourist as well as the\r\nresidents. We saw a few of the splendid black stallions, with long\r\ntails and manes, that were introduced into Russia during the reign of\r\nCatherine II by Prince Orloff, whose descendants now own the largest\r\nand most celebrated stock farm in the world, although I believe it was\r\nbadly used by the revolutionists several years ago. The ishvostchik, as\r\na drosky driver is called, is another distinctively Russian institution\r\nand we were very glad to see him again.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Russia hasn’t made any difference with the\r\nvigilance of the police, and it seemed as if the passengers of the\r\ngood ship _Euterpe_ were subjected to more than ordinary scrutiny by\r\nthe police before they would allow us to land. The captain made the\r\ndock at daylight, which at that time of year is about five o’clock in\r\nthe morning, and shortly before six o’clock all the passengers were\r\nawakened and invited to the salon. There we found a police officer\r\nwith a couple of clerks examining passports. After we had presented\r\nours and had explained our motives in visiting Russia, we were gruffly\r\ndismissed, but it was after nine o’clock before they would allow us\r\nto land. In the meantime they examined our luggage with great care\r\nin order, as were advised, to make sure that we were not importing\r\narms or anarchistic literature to corrupt the Caucasians. When the\r\nexamination was about half finished, I showed the chief inquisitor a\r\ngeneral letter of introduction given me by the Russian ambassador at\r\nWashington, certifying to my respectability and innocence. He read it\r\nthrough carefully, scowled fiercely, shook his head, and then began to\r\nsearch more energetically than before, regardless of ambassadors or\r\nother outside influences who have nothing to do with the case. But we\r\nare taught that there is good in everything, and contact with Russian\r\npolice officials certainly cultivates patience if nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRAILWAY CONCESSIONS IN TURKEY\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the overthrow of the despotism in Turkey, the new\r\ngovernment formulated a comprehensive scheme of public improvements\r\nintended to promote the material development of the Ottoman Empire,\r\nwhich was forbidden for a third of a century by Abdul Hamid, the\r\nlate sultan. He seemed to think that progress and prosperity were\r\ninconsistent with the welfare of a nation, or at least a menace to\r\nthe authority of an autocrat, and as long as he kept his subjects in\r\npoverty and ignorance, his sceptre was safe in his hands. He adhered\r\nstrictly to that policy. He forbade the development of mines or any\r\nother of the natural resources, and reluctantly consented to the\r\nconstruction of a few lines of railway, which were demanded by foreign\r\ncommerce and were built by foreign capital. The Germans always had\r\nthe preference in such matters, but there are also English and French\r\nrailway lines in Turkey. The sultan would never permit a telephone or\r\nan electric light or a trolley car or any other modern necessity of\r\ncommerce and social life, and his subjects were forbidden to travel\r\nfrom one place to another, even in their own province, without the\r\npermission of the police.\r\n\r\nWhen the present government invited proposals for the construction\r\nof railways through the interior of Turkey in Asia, one of the most\r\nimportant plans was submitted by Admiral C. M. Chester of the United\r\nStates Navy (retired) and his associates, who are organized under the\r\ntitle of “The Ottoman-American Development Company.” Their proposition\r\nwas thoroughly investigated by the Turkish government, approved by the\r\ndepartment of public works and the council of state and only required\r\nthe ratification of the Turkish Parliament to be complete. This would\r\nhave been done at the session of the Parliament in 1910 but for the\r\nintervention of Baron von Bieberstein, the German ambassador, who\r\nprotested on the ground that the concession interfered with the mining\r\nrights of some German subjects and was in violation of a treaty made\r\nbetween his government and the late sultan guaranteeing that no further\r\nmining concessions would be granted in Turkey without the consent of\r\nthe German government.\r\n\r\nBaron von Bieberstein’s purpose seems to have been to secure command of\r\nthe situation and to obtain additional favours for a company which was\r\nformed several years ago to extend one of the existing railway lines\r\nfrom its present terminus in the province of Anatolia to the Persian\r\nGulf. It is suspected also that certain German and Belgian capitalists\r\nwould be glad to secure a share of the Chester concession, which is\r\nvery comprehensive and involves a variety of interests.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Turkish ministry was exceedingly anxious to close the\r\narrangement and obtain the credit of promoting such an extensive\r\nscheme of internal improvements, they were afraid of Germany--first,\r\non account of the controversy with Greece over Crete, and, second, for\r\nfear the kaiser would object to a proposed increase in the Turkish\r\ntariff. This situation was complicated by the fact that the kaiser’s\r\nsister is the wife of the crown prince and the future king of Greece,\r\nand the Turkish administration cannot raise the necessary revenue by\r\nadvancing duties on imported goods 5 per cent., as is now proposed,\r\nwithout the consent of the five European Powers.\r\n\r\nThe concession involves the construction of about fifteen hundred miles\r\nof track through Armenia, Kurdistan, and Mesopotamia, and the vilayets\r\nof Trebizond, Sivas, Van, Diarbekir and Mossoul. The road begins at\r\nthe port of Snedis, on the Mediterranean, at the mouth of the Orontes\r\nRiver, about sixty miles south of Alexandretta, and about thirty miles\r\nfrom the ancient town of Antioch. From there it runs eastward through\r\nAleppo, Urfa, Diarbekir, Bitlis, and other populous cities to Lake\r\nVan and encircles that lake, which is the most important of all the\r\ninterior bodies of water in Turkey. From Diarbekir, which is to be a\r\njunction, one branch of the road will run northwest to the city of\r\nSivas and another southwest to the Persian boundary at Suleimanieh,\r\ncrossing the valleys of the Euphrates and the Tigris Rivers and\r\nbisecting the province of Mesopotamia, which it is proposed to reclaim\r\nto agriculture by the reconstruction of the vast systems of irrigation\r\nwhich were used by the ancients, and for some mysterious reason have\r\nbeen allowed to go to waste.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish government is contemplating the construction of a railroad\r\nfrom Sivas northward to Samsoun and Trebizond, on the Black Sea,\r\nand intends to extend the existing railroad from Constantinople to\r\nAngora to connect with the tracks of the Chester syndicate at Sivas.\r\nThe Russian government is determined to control all of the railway\r\nlines that touch the Black Sea, and has a treaty with Turkey which\r\nprevents any concession being granted to the Chester syndicate or any\r\nother except a Russian or Turkish corporation for a railroad into that\r\nterritory. It is entirely probable, however, that some arrangement\r\nmight be made for the construction of one and perhaps two lines between\r\nSivas and the Black Sea by the Turkish government.\r\n\r\nThe Chester concession is for ninety-nine years, the government\r\nreserving the right to purchase the whole or any part of the property\r\nafter a period of sixty years, on the basis of the average gross\r\nreceipts for the previous five years. The syndicate agrees to complete\r\nthe first third in five years, the second third in six years, and\r\nthe entire system in ten years, the total cost being estimated at\r\n$100,000,000. The government reserves the right to regulate charges\r\nfor freight and passengers, and the company agrees to transport\r\nmails, soldiers, and military supplies at a certain reduction from\r\nthe regular rates. The property is to be exempt from taxation for a\r\ncertain period. All materials are to be admitted free of duty, but the\r\ncompany must employ subjects of Turkey in the operation of the road\r\nas far as possible, and “they must wear the fez and such uniforms as\r\nthe government shall direct.” The company is under obligations to give\r\npreference to the government in transportation of troops and supplies\r\nin time of war, or whenever necessary. The funds for paying the cost\r\nof construction are to be raised by an issue of bonds and at least one\r\nhalf of the total must be offered publicly to Turkish subscribers for a\r\nperiod of thirty-one days.\r\n\r\nThere is no subsidy or guarantee of interest or principal, and no\r\nfinancial obligation whatever on the part of the government, but the\r\ndevelopment company, which is organized under the laws of New Jersey,\r\nwith the right to form subordinate companies, will have the exclusive\r\nright for ninety-nine years to exploit and work directly, or by leases\r\nto others, all mineral and petroleum deposits, all quarries, mineral\r\nwater springs, known or unknown, within an area of twenty kilometres\r\non both sides of the tracks for the entire distance, a total of\r\nabout fifteen hundred miles through the heart of Turkey. It has the\r\nexclusive right to all water-power within twenty kilometres of the\r\ntrack on both sides for electricity or manufacturing purposes; it is\r\nauthorized to furnish light and power to all towns and cities within\r\na zone of one hundred kilometres on both sides of the track; it has\r\nthe exclusive right to operate boats on Lake Van and build and operate\r\nsmelters, furnaces, elevators, warehouses, wharves, machine-shops and a\r\nvariety of other industries. One of the most important features of the\r\nconcession is the right to establish stores to sell such merchandise\r\nas it may deem proper or useful to the public and to its own employés.\r\nThe company is authorized to construct and operate telegraph lines for\r\nits own use, but it cannot do a commercial business, because that would\r\ninterfere with the government telegraph, which is a part of its postal\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise being of public utility, all property belonging to\r\nindividuals can be appropriated whenever necessary for carrying out\r\nthe provisions of the concession, and all concessions previously\r\ngranted which may interfere with the conditions of the contract are to\r\nbe terminated as speedily as possible. The government undertakes to\r\nindemnify the owners.\r\n\r\nThe resources of Turkey have never been developed. Nothing has ever\r\nbeen done by the government and very little by individuals, because,\r\nwhenever a Turk discovered anything of value or acquired any wealth, he\r\nwas robbed, blackmailed, and persecuted, and the government confiscated\r\nwhatever it could reach. Abdul Hamid had a personal title to much\r\nvaluable property, such as mineral deposits, petroleum wells, stone\r\nquarries, forests, and placed others in the names of his confidential\r\nmen. The new government has confiscated all of these properties and the\r\ntitles are now in the state. All such property lying along the line of\r\nthe proposed road becomes subject to the concession.\r\n\r\nThe Chester syndicate thus obtains the exclusive right to work certain\r\ncoal deposits that have been operated more or less by the government.\r\nThey are of unlimited extent, and the quality of the coal is said to be\r\nas fine as that of Cardiff. There is a deposit of copper at Arghana,\r\nwhich has been worked in a rude way for several thousand years and is\r\nbelieved to be one of the most valuable in the world. It belongs to the\r\nTurkish government and has been producing about $750,000 worth of ore\r\na month for the benefit of the sovereign. Several syndicates have been\r\norganized from time to time to get hold of it, but the sultan would\r\nnever let it go.\r\n\r\nOther extensive copper deposits are known to exist, but they have never\r\nbeen developed or even explored. There is a very large oil territory in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Mosul, in the valley of the Tigris, which has been\r\nknown for centuries. So long ago as the reign of Alexander the Great\r\nthe people used the seepage for lubricating purposes, for liniments,\r\nand for fuel. There is oil in other localities along the line, and no\r\nend of lead, zinc, and other minerals of greater or less value. The\r\nmountains through which the railway will pass have been the source\r\nof silver supply of the Armenians and the Kurds for twenty or thirty\r\ncenturies, but the mines have never been worked by modern processes.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the mineral deposits alone represent hundreds\r\nof millions of dollars in the territory covered by the concession,\r\nwithout regard to other interests of value. The development company,\r\nwhich will own the concession, proposes to divide and separate these\r\ninterests among several subordinate companies--one to build and\r\noperate the railway, another to operate the coal mines, another to\r\noperate the copper mines, another to develop the oil deposits, and\r\nothers to undertake the development of the various other interests.\r\nNumerous propositions have already been received from syndicates and\r\nindividuals, who are aware of valuable mineral, timber, and other\r\nresources along the proposed line, and have been trying in vain to\r\nobtain concessions from the Turkish government to develop them.\r\n\r\nMr. W. W. Masterson, American consul at Harpoot, who has served in this\r\npart of the world for many years and knows Turkey thoroughly, made a\r\nhorseback journey of 800 miles over the proposed routes of railways\r\nand reported to the secretary of state that he found no serious\r\ndifficulties of construction. The chief line proposed, he says, would\r\nfollow the Euphrates River almost its entire length without a heavier\r\ngrade than one foot to the mile, and there are no great engineering\r\ndifficulties to the other lines.\r\n\r\n“The valleys of the Euphrates and the Tigris, and the coves bordering\r\non Lake Van, are cultivated to a degree,” Mr. Masterson says, “and\r\nenough is raised with their primitive farming implements to feed\r\nthe people in that region. But little is exported because of the\r\ndifficulties and cost of transportation. With an outlet to market,\r\nproper methods of cultivation, and modern farming implements, the\r\nland is capable of producing many times more than is now raised. For\r\nexample, take the Mush Plain, through which the Euphrates winds its\r\nsluggish course. While the plain is wonderfully productive and well\r\nfitted in soil and climate for raising crops of all kinds, and every\r\nacre is fit for cultivation, yet not more than one third is cultivated.\r\nThe land is so abundant that a field is cultivated one year, and the\r\nnext year, possibly for several years, it is left fallow. The method\r\nused for breaking up new ground is slow, laborious, and unsatisfactory.\r\nA wooden plow on wheels is used, to which often eight or ten yoke of\r\noxen or buffalo are hitched, with a man sitting on the yoke of each\r\nteam, and a man behind to guide the plow. Each furrow is turned so\r\nslowly that the amount plowed each day would not equal a few hours’\r\nwork with an up-to-date plow and a strong team of horses, while the\r\nfurrows are never over six inches deep.\r\n\r\n“In the neighbourhood of many of the villages around the shores of Lake\r\nVan is a considerable quantity of Circassian walnut timber, some of\r\nthe trunks being of enormous size, upon which are knotty growths that\r\nwould make them of great value if they could be shipped to market. Some\r\nlittle business is done in this line with Marseilles, but in the most\r\nunsatisfactory and wasteful manner, so that the returns are small.\r\n\r\n“Lake Van is an unusually beautiful body of water,” continued Mr.\r\nMasterson, “about sixty miles long and thirty miles wide. The water is\r\nimpregnated with a potash of some kind and has a soft, soapy feeling.\r\nThe natives use it for washing their clothing without soap. Around\r\nthe lake is much tilled land of great richness, and many villages, in\r\naddition to the thriving city of Van, are located upon its shores.\r\nThere are a number of sailing boats, but they are so unwieldly that\r\nthey can only go before the wind and frequently are compelled to wait\r\na week or ten days for favourable weather. A boat run by steam power\r\nwould be a paying investment, and some years ago the local government\r\nordered a forty horse-power motor-boat from the United States through\r\nan American missionary, but it was delayed in the custom-house of\r\nTrebizond for more than a year and a half, and only reached Van last\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n“It is the mineral wealth of the country, however,” continued Mr.\r\nMasterson, “that is destined to make it prosperous. While I could not\r\ninvestigate for myself, I was told by thoroughly reliable persons of\r\nrich deposits of coal, iron, and copper, which have been worked more or\r\nless at long intervals for many centuries, but only for local supply.\r\nAn Armenian bishop told me of a vein of coal eight feet in thickness,\r\nwhich juts out of a mountain; a German told me that he knew of a bed\r\nof iron ore of such richness and purity that the blacksmiths of the\r\nvillages in that neighbourhood have been using it for years in their\r\nwork without having it smelted. There are beds of coal of excellent\r\nquality near the city of Van and every indication of petroleum. During\r\nthe insurrection two years ago the revolutionists secured all their\r\nbullets from some wonderfully rich lead deposits in the neighbourhood\r\nof Van. While I was at Bitlas the governor-general showed me some fine\r\nspecimens that looked like American anthracite and he told me of a\r\nsulphur mine near that city. Two days out from Bitlas I came across\r\nimmense deposits of marble jutting out of the mountain, not only white,\r\nbut dark red, green, and black.\r\n\r\n“There is an extensive deposit of copper half way between Diarbekir\r\nand Harpoot that is being worked to some extent in three places, one\r\nby private individuals and two by the government. A smelter near the\r\nmine is operated with wood fuel, which is a very scarce and expensive\r\ncommodity in this country, although the western branch of the Tigris\r\nRiver, a mountain torrent with a tremendous fall, passes only a few\r\nfeet from the smelter and might easily develop enough electrical energy\r\nfor all that country.\r\n\r\n“The copper ore is very rich. There is a spring of water at the\r\noutcropping which is so strongly impregnated that a French prospector\r\noffered the government $25,000 a year for the privilege of converting\r\nthe solution into solid copper, but the offer was refused and the\r\noverflow of that spring is still carrying its load of mineral into the\r\nTigris River.”\r\n\r\nRussia has already acquired about one third of Armenia by conquest, and\r\nhas been pushing its southern boundary line farther and farther into\r\nTurkey and Persia every time there is a war. And now Turkey has given\r\nthe Russians the exclusive right to construct railway lines from the\r\nports of Asia Minor and Armenia on the Black Sea. Several short lines\r\nwill doubtless be built. They will belong to the Russian government,\r\nand the next time an excuse is offered for hostilities the cars will\r\nbe loaded with Russian troops and arms and ammunition, brought across\r\nthe Black Sea from Sebastopol on Russian ships. The Turks have thus\r\nfurnished their most dangerous and aggressive enemy the facilities for\r\nan easy and irresistible invasion of their own territory. In addition\r\nto its military importance, the Russians have obtained a commercial\r\nadvantage of the greatest value. The country along the southern coast\r\nof the Black Sea is very rich and produces abundant crops, but the\r\npeople of the interior have no means except camel caravans of getting\r\ntheir produce to market. The Russians are to furnish them the necessary\r\nfacilities and will have the benefit of the results.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the mountains which skirt the coast are rich in minerals,\r\nbut have never been developed or even explored, because the sultan of\r\nTurkey has always forbidden it. A French company has a concession for\r\nworking a coal mine near the city of Kastamuni (you can find it on the\r\nmap about thirty miles inland from the coast of the Black Sea), but\r\nthey have no harbour and no railway and it costs as much to get the\r\ncoal over that thirty miles to the coast as it does to bring it from\r\nEngland. If a railway could be built and a harbour provided, the mines\r\nwould be a very profitable source of revenue. The coal is of excellent\r\nquality. It is easily worked and the nearest competition is Cardiff and\r\nNewcastle in England. The sultan has always opposed the development\r\nof these resources, but the new government is favourable. Russia and\r\nFrance are allies in all that concerns the East and it may be assumed\r\nthat the Russians will not only encourage but assist the French\r\nconcessionaires for this coal industry.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Chester concession had been approved and signed by every\r\nauthority of the executive branch of the government whose signature was\r\nnecessary, and had been formally approved by a unanimous vote of the\r\ncouncil of state, the grand vizier refused to submit it to the Chamber\r\nof Deputies whose ratification was necessary to make it complete. When\r\npressed to do so by the American ambassador, he explained that it\r\nwould first be necessary to make some modifications in the treaty of\r\namity and commerce which has been standing for nearly a hundred years,\r\nin order that the officials and employés of the proposed railroad,\r\nand the adventurers it would attract to the country, might be placed\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the Turkish courts. At present, as in all\r\nsemi-civilized countries, citizens of the United States residing in\r\nTurkey are tried before the American consul on the theory that they\r\ncannot secure justice in the local courts. This is called the doctrine\r\nof extra-territoriality, and is also adhered to by European Powers.\r\nWhile there has been considerable improvement in the judiciary of\r\nTurkey, the government is not yet sufficiently secure and the laws have\r\nnot yet been sufficiently modernized to justify the United States or\r\nthe European governments in submitting the personal and property rights\r\nof their subjects in Turkey to such jurisdiction, and neither the\r\nmerchants nor the missionaries now in the Ottoman Empire would consider\r\nthemselves safe under such an arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe grand vizier also raised the objection suggested by the German\r\nambassador, that the Chester concession interfered with the mining\r\nrights of a certain German subject, and with an agreement with the late\r\nsultan that no mining concessions would be granted in Turkey without\r\nthe consent of the German government. But the real reason for the\r\nrefusal to submit the concession for the ratification of the Chamber\r\nof Deputies appeared in January, 1911, when a secret arrangement\r\nentered into between Russia and Germany as to the future policy to be\r\npursued by those two governments in Persia and Turkey became known.\r\nThis agreement practically apportions the Turkish provinces in Asia and\r\nthe northern provinces of Persia between those two governments, so far\r\nas transportation facilities are concerned, without even consulting the\r\ngovernments of Turkey or Persia. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n“Article I.--The Imperial Russian government declares its willingness\r\nnot to oppose the realization of the Bagdad Railway project, and agrees\r\nnot to oppose any obstacle to the participation of foreign capitalists\r\nin this enterprise, it being understood that no sacrifice of a monetary\r\nor economic nature will be asked from Russia.\r\n\r\n“Article II.--In order to meet the wishes of the German government to\r\nconnect the Bagdad Railway with the system of railways to be built\r\nin Persia at a future date, the Russian government agrees, when this\r\nsystem has been constructed, to proceed with the building of a line\r\nto join, on the Turco-Persian frontier, the railway from Sadje to\r\nKhanikin, when this branch of the Bagdad Railway, together with the\r\nline from Koniah to Bagdad, shall have been completed. The Russian\r\ngovernment reserves the right to determine, at a time to suit itself,\r\nthe definite route of the line, which is to join up at Khanikin. Both\r\ngovernments will facilitate the international traffic on the Khanikin\r\nline, and will avoid all measures that might tend to hinder it; for\r\ninstance, the establishment of a transit time or the application of\r\ndifferential treatment.\r\n\r\n“Article III.--The German government agrees not to construct any\r\nrailway lines in any other zone than that of the Bagdad line and the\r\nTurco-Persian frontier to the north of Khanikin, and not to lend its\r\nmaterial or diplomatic support to any undertakings of this nature in\r\nthe said zone.\r\n\r\n“Article IV.--The German government once more declares that it has no\r\npolitical interests in Persia, and that it is only pursuing commercial\r\naims there. It recognizes, on the other hand, that Russia has special\r\ninterests in northern Persia, from a political, strategic, and\r\neconomical point of view.\r\n\r\n“The German government also declares that it has no intention of\r\nseeking, for its own profit, or of supporting in any way, either for\r\nits own subjects or for those of other nations, any concessions for\r\nrailways, roads, steamship routes, telegraphs, or other concessions of\r\na territorial nature to the north of the line beginning at Kasrihin,\r\ncrossing Ispahan, Jezd, and Khakh, and ending at the Afghan frontier\r\nat the latitude of Ghasik. If the German government seeks such\r\nconcessions, it must first of all come to an agreement with the Russian\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, the Russian government will consent to recognize,\r\nwith regard to German trade in Persia, the principle of absolute\r\nequality of treatment.”\r\n\r\nThe publication of this agreement naturally created a decided sensation\r\nin Turkey and Persia, and the grand vizier was questioned about it on\r\nthe floor of the Chamber of Deputies at Constantinople. He had very\r\nlittle to say and was evidently very much embarrassed. He explained\r\nthat the arrangement was made without preliminary conferences with his\r\ngovernment, but assurances had been received from both Germany and\r\nRussia that the interests of Turkey would be completely protected.\r\nAs the plans for transportation lines disclosed by this arrangement\r\ninterfere directly with the rights granted to the Chester syndicate,\r\nit will be necessary for the government of the United States to take\r\npart in whatever negotiations may follow, or withdraw entirely from\r\nparticipation in the development of the material resources of Turkey.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the Bagdad Railway is one of the greatest projects\r\ndecided upon by the Turkish government. The concession has already\r\nbeen granted. The work of construction has already begun; two hundred\r\nkilometres of track have been laid from Konia toward Adana, and the\r\ncompany has received $80,000 a mile for what has cost it less than\r\n$50,000. Now that the expensive part of the line has been reached,\r\nthrough the Anti-Taurus Mountains, the managers are holding up and\r\nmaking excuses for not continuing work. They want to change the route.\r\nThey have already made between $5,000,000 and $6,000,000 profit, which\r\nhas been divided among the concessionaires, and have thus gotten into\r\nbad habits. They are reluctant to undertake work that will cost every\r\ndollar they will get for it, and perhaps more, although the concession\r\nwas accepted as a whole and not in parts. Instead of crossing the\r\nmountains where the road is needed they have asked the government to\r\npermit them to follow the coast line, where there will be little or no\r\ngrade and where the track can be laid for less than one half of the\r\nguarantee per mile. If you will take a map of the Turkish Empire you\r\ncan easily see the situation.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the Anatolian Railway begins at Haidar-Pasha, on\r\nthe Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, opposite Constantinople, and runs\r\neastward, following a sort of zigzag course, to the city of Angora, in\r\nAsia Minor. A branch runs down to Murad, where it connects with a line\r\nfrom Smyrna, and a little farther south, at Alshehr, it connects with\r\na line from Aidin. Both Smyrna and Aidin are on the Ægean Sea and are\r\nvery important ports.\r\n\r\nThe railways I have described have been in operation for several years.\r\nThey owe their existence to British enterprise and were built with\r\nBritish capital, but have passed into the control of the International\r\nSyndicate, which holds the concession for the Bagdad Railway, and are\r\nto be a part of that system. In other words, the present Anatolian\r\nRailway is to be extended through Asia Minor and Mesopotamia via Bagdad\r\nto the Persian Gulf, and there connect with a projected line across\r\nPersia and Afghanistan to join the railway system of India at Quetta\r\nor some other convenient place. This will connect the Mediterranean\r\nand the Black Seas with the Persian Gulf, and, in the growing railway\r\ntransportation system of Asia, will correspond to the Sunset line of\r\nthe Southern Pacific in the United States, in the same way as the\r\nGreat Siberian road corresponds to the Northern Pacific and the Great\r\nNorthern, and the Central Asia Railway to the Union and Central Pacific\r\nroute. Already 640 kilometres, or about four hundred and fifty miles,\r\nhave been completed and about one thousand miles remain to be built.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty in carrying out the scheme has been politics.\r\nThe financial aspects are clear, but the political interests at\r\nstake are widespread and complicated. Five of the great Powers of\r\nEurope are involved in the undertaking. Great Britain acquiesced\r\nonly upon the condition that it should be allowed to control that\r\nportion of the route between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. The\r\ncompany is incorporated in Switzerland. The incorporators represent\r\nthe Anatolian Railway Company of Constantinople, which, as I have\r\nalready explained, is the first link in the line; the Deutsche Bank\r\nof Berlin, the Credit-Mobilier of Paris, the Imperial Ottoman Bank of\r\nConstantinople, the Weiner Bank Verein of Vienna, the Banca Commerciale\r\nItaliana of Milan, the Swiss Creditanstadt, and several British and\r\nBelgian interests. The Deutsche Bank of Berlin, through its branch\r\nat Constantinople, has immediate management, and by manipulation has\r\nobtained practically absolute control, so that, with the exception of\r\nthe unbuilt but proposed section from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf, which\r\nmay not be constructed for years, it is practically a German enterprise.\r\n\r\nAlthough the other powers are involved, as I have explained, their\r\nrepresentatives have taken no active participation in the work and\r\nhave simply been content to have their names appear in the articles\r\nof incorporation, and to encourage their capitalists to invest in the\r\nstocks and bonds. With the exception of the Germans, therefore, the\r\ninternational representation which has been insisted upon from the\r\nbeginning by Turkey, and by the Powers also, is merely theoretical.\r\nIn case of war or any aggressive demonstration on the part of Turkey,\r\nit is likely to assume a practical character, however, and therefore,\r\nAustria, Italy, and especially England are contented to allow the\r\nGermans to do the work so long as they have a voice in controlling the\r\npolitics of the road.\r\n\r\nAs you will see by looking at the map, the city of Adana, Turkey,\r\nis some distance in the interior; but it is connected with the\r\nMediterranean by a short line of railway to the port of Mersina on\r\nthe southern coast of Asia Minor. At present, Mersina is only an open\r\nroadstead and offers no shelter to vessels, but the situation is such\r\nthat a harbour will not cost a large sum of money and the engineering\r\nfeatures are not difficult. The railway from Mersina to Adana was\r\nconstructed by a British company in 1886, but has since passed under\r\nthe control of the Germans and is doing a good business. The country\r\nback of Adana, known as the Cilician Plain, is very favourable to\r\ncotton culture, and a considerable quantity of that staple is already\r\nproduced there. Under the encouragement of the new government the\r\nindustry will doubtless develop rapidly, but so long as Abdul Hamid\r\nwas in control of affairs it was scarcely worth while for anybody to\r\ndevelop profitable enterprises, because they would invariably tempt the\r\ncormorants who surrounded the sultan to spoliation.\r\n\r\nThe Bagdad Railway has now reached the town of Bulgurlu, beyond Eregli,\r\nin the foothills of the Anti-Taurus Mountains, and about fifty miles\r\nfrom Adana; but, as I have said, it is the most expensive piece of\r\nconstruction on the road and the German managers hesitate to undertake\r\nit. After they reach Adana there is another stretch of a hundred\r\nmiles or more which is also very heavy and expensive work, requiring\r\nmany cuts, embankments, rockwork, and tunnels. The managers have put\r\nin an application for a change of route along the coast by way of\r\nAlexandretta and Antioch and from there approach the valley of the\r\nEuphrates by way of Aleppo. This route would be a great advantage as\r\na measure of economy, but as the Turkish military authorities have\r\npointed out, it exposes the railway to any foreign fleet that may\r\nenter the Gulf of Iskanderoon, on which Alexandretta is located. If\r\nthe track lay back in the mountains, it would be more difficult to\r\ninterfere with traffic in time of war.\r\n\r\nThe Bagdad Railway is expected to follow the valley of the Euphrates\r\nor that of the Tigris, the two great historic rivers which encircle\r\nthat mysterious country known as Mesopotamia, where, according to the\r\nScriptures, was the cradle of mankind, and the first inhabited section\r\nof the earth’s surface. Mesopotamia was formerly dotted with prosperous\r\ncities and supported a large population, but it is now practically\r\nuninhabited. The cities are in ruins, the population has perished,\r\nand the entire area has become a desert because of the destruction of\r\nirrigation systems which were built before the birth of Abraham. The\r\ngovernment has already undertaken a scheme of reclamation at a cost of\r\n$10,000,000. Sir William Willcocks, who built the Assouan dam on the\r\nNile, made the survey and furnished the estimates. He declares that\r\nthere is no difficulty in the reclamation of the entire area between\r\nthe Euphrates and the Tigris that money cannot remove.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1911, Nazim Pasha, governor-general of Bagdad, on behalf\r\nof the Turkish government, signed a contract with Sir John Jackson,\r\nof Westminster, London, for the erection of a dam at the head of the\r\nHindia branch of the Euphrates, as the first step in carrying out these\r\nrecommendations, and the work is to be pushed forward as rapidly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nMesopotamia is that portion of Turkey lying between the Euphrates and\r\nthe Tigris Rivers--an area about three hundred miles long and varying\r\nfrom fifty to two hundred miles in width. Within the oval, according to\r\nthe estimates of the engineers, are about 12,000,000 acres, of which\r\n9,000,000 is desert and 2,500,000 fresh-water swamp, and they estimate\r\nthat 6,000,000 acres can be reclaimed. There are several large, shallow\r\nlakes fed by the annual overflow of the Euphrates and Tigris. Both are\r\nlarge rivers having their sources in the lakes and mountains of Armenia\r\nand emptying into the Persian Gulf about fifty miles below the town of\r\nKurna, where they join their waters and become one.\r\n\r\nBetween those rivers are the oldest habitations of men; the birthplace\r\nof the human race; the supposed site of the Garden of Eden, and\r\nthe ruins of the capitals and commercial cities of a dozen extinct\r\ncivilizations. It is the most interesting field for archæologists on\r\nthe earth’s surface and exploring parties from American, British,\r\nGerman, and French universities and scientific societies have been\r\nconstantly at work for half a century or more uncovering the remains\r\nof the imperial magnificence of Babylon, Nineveh, Palmyra, and other\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nSir William Willcocks has contributed some interesting theories in\r\nconnection with Biblical history and archæology, in addition to his\r\nrecommendations for an irrigation system. He locates the Garden of Eden\r\nat Hairlah, a lovely and flourishing oasis in a delta of the Euphrates,\r\nabout two hundred miles northwest of the city of Bagdad. At this point\r\nthe four rivers of Eden mentioned in the book of Genesis have been\r\nidentified by him, and other topographical features which he believes\r\nto be indisputable.\r\n\r\nSir William also gives us an interesting theory concerning the deluge,\r\nwhich he believes was merely the flooding of the plain between the\r\nEuphrates and the Tigris by the overflow of those rivers, which is\r\ncaused by the sudden melting of the snows and the heavy rainfalls in\r\nthe latter part of March and the first of April. These floods occur\r\nannually, and on the particular occasion referred to in the book of\r\nGenesis, Sir William believes an unusual volume of water came down\r\nbecause of a sudden “spell” of hot weather and an unusually heavy\r\nrainfall.\r\n\r\nSir William thinks Noah was inspired to build the ark in anticipation\r\nof such a flood, and floated around in it until he ran aground, not on\r\nthe mountain of Ararat, but near the town of Ur of the Chaldees, in the\r\nprovince of Ararat and a part of Armenia. He believes that a careful\r\nreading of the Scripture story of the flood will justify this theory,\r\nwhich, indeed, is not new. Many Biblical scholars reject the tradition\r\nthat the ark landed on a mountain and hold that the word “Ararat” in\r\nthe book of Genesis refers to the province and not to the peaks of that\r\nname.\r\n\r\nHe declares that if Noah had been a hydraulic engineer he would have\r\ndone much better by cutting a channel for the escape of the waters\r\nthrough the bed of the river Pison, for he might thus have saved the\r\nentire population. The Pison is one of the four rivers of Eden, the\r\nGihon, Hiddekel, and Euphrates being the others. All of them are really\r\nbranches of the Euphrates and form a delta in which the Garden of Eden\r\nis believed to have been situated.\r\n\r\nNearly the entire area of Mesopotamia was once under irrigation, and\r\nthe first known dams and canals were built by Nimrod of the Bible, who\r\nis identified as the Hammurabi of the inscriptions that are frequently\r\nfound among the ruins. Cyrus the Great and Alexander the Great saw\r\nMesopotamia in its greatest prosperity. The decay of the country began\r\nwith the invasion of Genghis Khan and his Mongol horde and Timour\r\nthe Tartar, who destroyed the dams and the ditches and plundered the\r\npeople of all their wealth so that they had no means to restore the\r\nirrigation system. Hundreds of miles of the ancient canals can be\r\neasily identified, and Sir William testifies to the remarkable degree\r\nof genius shown by the engineers who designed and constructed them. In\r\nhis report to the Turkish government he recommends that the old canals\r\nbe restored as far as possible, which can be done at half the cost of\r\nconstructing new ones.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonians, Medes, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Saracens, and\r\nCaliphs added to the number of reservoirs and extended the canals\r\nthat were built by the patriarchs of the Scriptures. The fabulous\r\nwealth of Babylon, Nineveh, Palmyra, Nippur, Kufa, and other great\r\ncities of ancient times was largely derived from agriculture, in a\r\nterritory that is now a desert; from the cultivation of soil which for\r\nthousands of years has been celebrated for its extreme fertility. Sir\r\nWilliam Willcocks declares that the greater part of the valleys of the\r\nEuphrates and the Tigris and of the area between these rivers is as\r\nrich as the valley of the Nile. In his report he says:\r\n\r\n“Of all the regions of the earth none is more favoured by nature for\r\nthe production of cereals than the valley of the Tigris. Cotton,\r\nsugar-cane, Indian corn, and all the summer cereals, leguminous plants,\r\nEgyptian clover, opium, and tobacco will find themselves at home as\r\nthey do in Egypt.”\r\n\r\nThere is a passage in Herodotus, written more than 2,000 years\r\nprevious, about this same country, which sounds very much like the\r\nWillcocks report:\r\n\r\n“This is of all lands with which we are acquainted, by far the best\r\nfor the growth of corn. It is so fruitful in the produce of corn that\r\nit yields continually two hundred-fold, and when it produces its best\r\nit yields even three hundred-fold. The blades of wheat and barley grow\r\nthere to full four fingers in breadth, and though I well know to what a\r\nheight millet and sesame grow, I shall not mention it.”\r\n\r\nThe proposed reclamation, according to the Willcocks report, can\r\nbe completed for $40,000,000, and bring under irrigation more\r\nthan 3,000,000 acres, which he estimates would be worth at least\r\n$100,000,000, or $30 an acre. The Assouan dam system, which he has\r\nrecently completed, cost the Egyptian government $25,000,000, and only\r\nabout half the area was reclaimed.\r\n\r\nSir William proposes, by dams and canals, to store the floods that are\r\nbrought down from the mountains in the spring, in enormous reservoirs\r\nfor use during the summer, and has indicated locations for at least\r\nfive, which will, he believes, answer every purpose. At least two of\r\nthese locations were used as reservoirs by the Babylonians and probably\r\nby previous civilizations, and Sir William will adapt to modern use\r\nthe same canals that were then used to distribute the water over the\r\nplains. Several dry river beds can also be made available and thus\r\neconomize the cost.\r\n\r\nAfter the 3,000,000 acres that will be first reclaimed have been sold\r\nand settled, the area available for agriculture can be doubled by the\r\nexpenditure of $15,000,000 additional, and ultimately the gain would\r\nbe 6,000,000 acres capable of producing annually, according to his\r\nestimates, 2,000,000 tons of wheat, 4,000,000 hundred-weight of cotton\r\nand fabulous quantities of other exportable products, in addition to\r\nwhatever food will be necessary to support a population of a million\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the agricultural products, he promises pasturage for\r\nmillions of sheep and goats and hundreds of thousands of cattle in\r\nthe delta, and he would build a railway from Bagdad to Damascus with\r\nbranches here and there to tap the harvest fields. The total length of\r\nthis road would be about five hundred and fifty miles and, according\r\nto his estimates, it could be constructed for between ten and eleven\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\nThe high price of cotton has caused the manufacturers of Manchester\r\nand other mill districts of England to seek new sources of supply. The\r\nattempts to extend the volume of the products of Egypt have not been\r\nsuccessful, notwithstanding the investment of $25,000,000 in irrigation\r\nplants. The trouble is chiefly the lack of labour, and the indifference\r\nand indolence of the fellahs or peasant farmers in the valley of the\r\nNile. Nor can the product of Egypt be increased to any considerable\r\ndegree without the importation of labour. Several planters have tried\r\nAmerican negroes but they wilt under the climate of Egypt and soon\r\nacquire the habits of the peasants around them.\r\n\r\nThe experimental plantations on the west coast of Africa have also\r\nbeen a disappointment for similar reasons. In the British possessions\r\non both coasts of Africa are millions of available acres for planting\r\ncotton, but they lie idle because there are no hands to cultivate them.\r\nThe native African will not work. He and his ancestors have managed to\r\nsurvive until the present day without labour, and it is difficult to\r\npersuade him that the curse pronounced upon our common father applies\r\nto him as it does to other human beings. Nature has supplied him with\r\nsufficient food thus far and he cannot be induced to go into the cotton\r\nfields to earn money that he has no use for.\r\n\r\nThese facts, which have given the manufacturers of Manchester great\r\nconcern, are the reasons for the interest they are taking in the\r\ndevelopment of Mesopotamia, and several schemes have been proposed\r\nfor colonizing there the excess of human life in Italy that has been\r\ngoing to the United States and the Argentine Republic. It has also been\r\nsuggested that the Jews, who are not wanted in Russia and Roumania,\r\nmight also be induced to settle in Mesopotamia. These plans, however,\r\nwill not be realized for the present. The members of the Turkish\r\ncabinet are so timid about granting concessions for more necessary\r\npublic works that it seems scarcely worth while to seek their approval\r\nof such a comprehensive plan as Sir William Willcocks has offered. So\r\nlong as they cannot be induced to give concessions for telephones,\r\nelectric lights, electric cars, and other public conveniences in their\r\nown capital, it is not likely that they would authorize the expenditure\r\nof $40,000,000 in reclaiming an uninhabited desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CAUCASUS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you will glance at the map, you will notice a mountain chain\r\nextending diagonally across what looks like a narrow strip of land\r\nbetween the Black and Caspian Seas, but it is not as narrow as it\r\nlooks. It is more than five hundred miles between the two seas.\r\nThe Caucasus range is one of the most remarkable of all geological\r\nphenomena. It is the boundary between Europe and Asia, and an almost\r\nimpenetrable wall which can be crossed by vehicles or horsemen in only\r\ntwo places, known as the Dariel and the Manisson Passes.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of history until the Middle Ages it was the boundary\r\nof the world. Beyond, all was mystery and fable, and for that reason\r\nthe ancients made the Caucasus the scene of much mythological activity\r\nand the home of many marvels. They called the country Colchis, and\r\nit was there that Jason and the Argonauts found the Golden Fleece.\r\nPrometheus was chained to one of the peaks by the gods to punish him\r\nfor giving fire to the mortals. Within the Caucasus dwelt man-hating\r\nAmazons of whom scandalous stories were told, with treasures of gold\r\nand silver and precious stones unlimited but unattainable, because they\r\nwere guarded by griffins and one-eyed monsters called Arimaspians.\r\n\r\nThe Cæsars led their legions as far as the foot of the mountains;\r\nPompey fought a battle under the shadow of the highest peak; Alexander\r\nthe Great reconnoitred through the foothills seeking a passage to\r\nthe unknown regions beyond, but did not find it until he reached the\r\nCaspian Sea. All the great invaders of the prehistoric period smote the\r\nCaucasus with their impotent swords, but never passed beyond; and the\r\nfirst Europeans to find their way through the rocky labyrinths were\r\nGreek and Genoese traders, who crawled through the cañons on foot in\r\nthe Middle Ages in search of customers. Much was risked for gold and\r\nglory in man’s struggle with nature that lasted many centuries here,\r\nand it was not until the territory was added to the Russian Empire\r\nearly in the nineteenth century that the Caucasus became passable. For\r\nmilitary purposes the Russians have built wagon roads through the two\r\ncañons at a cost of many hundred thousand rubles, over which its armies\r\nand their supplies have since passed into the hinterland.\r\n\r\nShakespeare shared the awe of the ancient Greeks, and was also inspired\r\nby the romance attached to these impassable barriers. He frequently\r\nalluded to them in his plays.\r\n\r\n     “For who can hold a coal of fire in his hands\r\n      While thinking of the frosty Caucasus.”\r\n\r\nPrometheus was one of the Titans, a gigantic race which inhabited the\r\nearth before the creation of men. To him and his brother Epimetheus\r\nwas entrusted the duty of providing man and all other animals with the\r\nfaculties necessary for their comfort and preservation. Epimetheus\r\nproceeded to bestow upon the animals gifts of strength, intelligence,\r\ncourage, and swiftness. He gave wings to one class, claws to another,\r\nhorns to a third, and fur to those that were to inhabit the colder\r\nparts of the earth; but when man came to be provided for, Epimetheus\r\nhad been so generous in giving away his treasures that he had nothing\r\nleft to bestow upon him. In his perplexity he appealed to his brother\r\nPrometheus, who, with the aid of Minerva, went up to heaven, lighted\r\na torch from the sun, and brought down to man the gift of fire which\r\nmade him superior to all other animals. It enabled him to make weapons\r\nwherewith to subdue them, tools with which to cultivate the earth,\r\nmaterial for the arts and trades and commerce, and heat to warm his\r\ndwelling and cook his food.\r\n\r\nJupiter, seeing this state of things, burned with anger and summoned\r\nthe gods to council. They obeyed the call and started for the palace\r\nof heaven along a road which any one may see on a clear night. It\r\nstretches across the face of the sky, and is called the Milky Way.\r\nHaving considered his offence, Prometheus was declared an enemy of the\r\ngods and Jupiter had him chained to a rock at the summit of Mt. Kazbek\r\nin the Caucasus, where a vulture preyed forever upon his liver, which\r\nwas renewed as fast as devoured. This state of torment might have been\r\nterminated at any time by Prometheus if he had been willing to submit\r\nto Jupiter, but he disdained to do so. He was a friend of mankind, who\r\nhad interposed in their behalf when the gods were incensed against\r\nthem, and had taught them civilization and the arts. He has therefore\r\nbeen used as a symbol of magnanimous endurance, of unmerited suffering,\r\nand strength of will to resist oppression.\r\n\r\nThe range is about seven hundred miles long, although the distance\r\nlooks much shorter on the map, and it bisects the Russian province of\r\nthe Caucasus northwest and southeast, dipping so low as it approaches\r\nthe Caspian Sea that for thirty miles the coast is only a few feet\r\nabove tide-water.\r\n\r\nThe territory north of the mountains is known officially as the\r\nCaucasus, and that south of it as the trans-Caucasus. Both belong to\r\nRussia. Formerly, and the names can be found on all of the old maps,\r\nthe territory north was divided into independent states--Circassia,\r\nDaghestan, Astrakan, and the steppe of the Kalmucks--but they have lost\r\ntheir identity, and the thrones of their former rulers may be found in\r\nthat marvellous collection of trophies of conquest in the Kremlin at\r\nMoscow. South of the Caucasus is the ancient kingdom of Georgia, and\r\nbeyond that Armenia, Kurdistan, and the Azerbaijan province of Persia.\r\n\r\nThe geological interest in the Caucasus Mountains is due to the fact\r\nthat they rise abruptly from two flat plains, similar to our western\r\nprairies, known as steppes, and are unique because of the simplicity\r\nof their structure, the regularity of their outlines, the steepness\r\nof the declivities, and the narrowness of the range. It is not split\r\nup, as other great mountain chains are, into secondary and parallel\r\nranges, and has no buttresses running at right angles, nor outlying\r\npeaks. The greatest width of the range is only about 120 miles; all the\r\nloftiest summits are on the single watershed, which for several hundred\r\nmiles does not sink below seven thousand feet. Elburz, the highest\r\npeak, rises 18,493 feet above the Black Sea and overtops all others\r\nin Europe. Kazbek, to which Prometheus was chained, according to the\r\nlegend, is 16,523 feet. There are seven other peaks exceeding 15,000\r\nfeet and nine peaks exceeding 14,000 feet, which make the Caucasus by\r\nfar the highest mountains in Europe. The gorges are more savage, the\r\ncañons are deeper, the peaks are steeper and sharper and more difficult\r\nof ascent than those of any other range in the world. The Caucasus\r\nMountains are not as beautiful as the Alps, but are more imposing and\r\nmajestic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Georgian Prince and his sons]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Georgian beauty]\r\n\r\nThere is supposed to be great mineral wealth in the Caucasus, and the\r\nnatives in ancient times, on both sides of the range, possessed much\r\ngold and an abundance of rough jewels. The crowns and sceptres of the\r\nGeorgian and Circassian kings in the Kremlin at Moscow are richly\r\ndecorated with jewels, some uncut and others rudely cut. The nobles\r\nand warriors of both countries loaded themselves with silver and gold\r\nornaments. Their guns and pistols and their swords and daggers had\r\nhandles of gold and silver set in precious stones. The vessels they\r\nused in their households, the ornaments in their churches, the gifts\r\nthey presented to their friends, and the loot that was taken away by\r\nthe Persians, Russians, and other invaders, testify that there must\r\nhave been much profitable mining in ancient times: and the story\r\nof the Golden Fleece is not a mere legend, because even to-day the\r\nmountaineers are in the habit of anchoring fleeces of wool from their\r\nsheep in the streams, as traps to catch the grains of gold that float\r\ndown in the water.\r\n\r\nThe Caucasians have always been famous as goldsmiths and silversmiths,\r\nand in every museum of Europe you can find examples of their skill\r\nand taste. Even to-day in the bazaars of old Tiflis, long streets are\r\noccupied exclusively by cunning artificers making cups and flagons,\r\nhandles for swords and knives, pistols and guns, ornaments for the\r\nbody and the household, bowls and dishes for the table, and all sorts\r\nof decorative and useful objects of the precious metals. They are\r\nespecially skilful in combining iron and silver, and iron and gold,\r\nalthough this art has never reached the same perfection there that is\r\nfound in similar products in Toledo, Spain.\r\n\r\nThere are rumours of coal mines, and they probably exist, but the\r\nabundance of timber has not encouraged the people to work them. Iron\r\nand copper are found frequently, from which the ancients always had\r\nan abundant supply. About twenty-five miles up the railway from\r\nBatoum is an extensive operation by the Caucasus Copper Company, an\r\nAmerican-English syndicate. They are getting out a good deal of copper,\r\nan average of 120 tons a month, which is shipped to Moscow and St.\r\nPetersburg for local use. About eight hundred hands are employed in the\r\nmines and in the smelters.\r\n\r\nPetroleum has been known in the foothills and along the sea coast at\r\nthe eastern extremity of the Caucasus Mountains from the earliest times.\r\n\r\nThere is a railway on each side of the Caucasus Mountains. That on the\r\nnorthern side runs from Baku, the oil centre, to the city of Rostov, at\r\nthe mouth of the river Don and the head of the Sea of Azov. That on the\r\nsouth runs from Batoum to Baku, and is the principal thoroughfare for\r\nthe shipment of oil to other parts of Europe than Russia. The annual\r\nshipments of refined petroleum from Batoum to the rest of the world\r\nhave averaged about four million barrels, but the Russian refiners\r\ncannot compete with the Standard Oil Company, either in the quality or\r\nthe price of their product. Russian oil has practically been driven\r\nout of all the European countries except Turkey, Roumania, Hungary, and\r\nRussia, and the Standard Oil Company is now “the Light of Asia” without\r\na rival flame.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the revolution in Russia in 1905, the employés of both\r\noil companies at Batoum struck. Fifteen hundred men on the Nobel dock,\r\nand a thousand more who were working for the other companies, quit work\r\nbecause the new constitution of Russia, as they construed it, granted\r\nthem liberty to do as they pleased. The oil companies, assuming that\r\nthey possessed similar rights, closed their warehouses and have never\r\nresumed business. After the strikers had enjoyed all of the liberty of\r\nthis kind they desired, they asked to be taken back, but the operators\r\nshook their heads and said there would be no more work for them. Hence\r\nthe population of Batoum has been reduced by several thousand since\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 the Russian government built a broad highway, with a gentle\r\ngrade, from Tiflis, the capital of the Caucasus, through the\r\nsouthernmost of the only two passes by which the Caucasus Mountains\r\ncan be crossed. It is called Dariel Pass, and it crosses the grand\r\ndivide between Europe and Asia at an altitude of 7,698 feet. The other\r\npass, about eighty miles farther north, is called Manisson and crosses\r\nthe divide at 8,400 feet. On the European side of the Caucasus, at\r\nthe northern end of the pass, is the city of Vladicaucasus, sometimes\r\nspelled Vladikowkaz, and in various other ways--a Russian word which\r\nmeans “the master of the Caucasus,” and from a military sense it\r\nanswers that definition.\r\n\r\nMount Elburz, 18,493 feet high, the highest peak in Europe, is on the\r\nnorthern side of the grand divide, but cannot be seen from either\r\nTiflis or Vladicaucasus. Kazbek, 16,523 feet, the second peak in\r\nheight, 112 miles almost directly north of Tiflis, can often be seen\r\nfrom that city, and at one point of the military road, for a few rods,\r\na splendid vista can be had of the monster when its snow-clad summit is\r\nnot hidden in the clouds.\r\n\r\nThe pass is crossed daily by an automobile omnibus similar to those\r\nwhich run between hotels and railway stations in our cities. The\r\npassengers occupy slippery longitudinal seats inside, and their luggage\r\nis carried on top. It is a most inappropriate vehicle for pleasure\r\nriding and those who are unfortunate enough to cross that way see a\r\nlittle of the scenery on one side of the road. It is much better to\r\ntake an open carriage, a “tsetvioria,” as they call it, a sort of\r\nlandeau drawn by four horses hitched abreast. That is open to all that\r\nmay be seen above or below, and has a cover that can be drawn over it\r\nin case of rain. The journey across the pass by carriage requires two\r\ndays, being 135 miles, but you have to start at daylight both mornings.\r\nThere are rest houses on the way where one can eat and sleep if he can\r\nput up with a good deal of dirt and discomfort, but the best way is to\r\nmake an excursion down from Vladicaucasus to the village of Kazbek at\r\nthe foot of that mountain, which will permit one to see the finest part\r\nof the scenery and return the same night.\r\n\r\nA railway has been planned and surveyed, and will doubtless be built,\r\nthrough the pass. Indeed, we understand that construction has already\r\nbeen begun by the Russian war department. It will not be a difficult\r\nor very expensive task, because the cañon is wide, except in a few\r\nplaces, and the engineering problem is nowhere nearly as difficult as\r\nmany that have been encountered in other parts of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe scenery will attract many tourists, although the Russian government\r\ncares little about that. There is nothing in Europe grander or more\r\nsavage than the cañons and gorges and mountain peaks of the Dariel;\r\nthey equal, if they do not surpass, the boldest forms of nature in the\r\nAlps. One cañon is 4,000 feet deep, with almost perpendicular walls,\r\nand for seventy-five miles or more the cliffs and crags on both sides\r\nrise to a height of 1,500 and 1,800 feet. From the time the cañon is\r\nentered at the north until the traveller emerges from it at the south\r\nthe distance is about seventy-five miles, and there is not one mile\r\nwithout peculiar interest and attraction. The Terek River, which finds\r\nits source among the everlasting snows of Kazbek, dashes northward in\r\na tawny torrent and the carriage road follows its bed. On the southern\r\nslope the river Kur, born in the glaciers of Kazbek, is followed to the\r\ncity of Tiflis. For three fourths of the distance the cañon is wide\r\nenough to admit half a dozen railway tracks without trenching upon the\r\nriver or having to blast a roadway out of the rocky mountain side, but\r\nin two or three of the narrower places some heavy stonework will be\r\nnecessary. The scenery will remind you of the fiords of Norway more\r\nthan anything you have ever seen in Switzerland or the United States,\r\nand its greatest attraction is due to the forests and underbrush, with\r\nwhich every mountain side is clothed up to the snow line.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven miles from Vladicaucasus, going south, the road suddenly\r\nturns a sharp corner around a point of rocks and the traveller finds\r\nhimself face to face with Kazbek, a steep, glittering dome of snow\r\nrising 16,523 feet above the sea. There is a little village of the same\r\nname at the snow line, which is about 9,000 feet, in the most savage\r\npart of the range, and the Russian government keeps a rest house there\r\nfor the shelter of those who wish to make the ascent.\r\n\r\nAccording to local tradition, Prometheus was chained to a certain\r\nprecipice on the slopes of Kazbek. The guides will show you the exact\r\nspot, just as visitors to the Chateau d’If in the harbour of Marseilles\r\nare shown the exact dungeon in which the hero of Alexander Dumas’s\r\nfamous novel, “Monte Cristo,” was imprisoned. They forget that both\r\nwere heroes of fiction, and Æschylus, in writing his tragedy, evidently\r\ndid not know the geography of the Caucasus, for he describes the rock\r\nas overhanging the sea, which is more than three hundred miles distant.\r\nThere are several magnificent glaciers in sight of the roadway, those\r\nof Dievdorak being among the largest in the world and altogether the\r\nmost extensive in Europe. There are none in Switzerland that will\r\ncompare with them.\r\n\r\nThis road was built by the Russian government for purely military\r\npurposes, in order that troops, artillery, and supplies may be hurried\r\nacross into Turkey or Persia or wherever else they may be needed, and\r\nManisson is the only other route by which the highest range in Europe\r\ncan be crossed. Otherwise, it would be necessary to go as far east as\r\nthe shores of the Caspian or as far west as the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The native costume of Georgia]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Head-dress of a Georgian lady]\r\n\r\nThe road is fortified from end to end. There are half a dozen garrisons\r\nstationed at different points and a stronger military defence\r\ncan scarcely be imagined. A few rapid-fire guns could hold back an\r\narmy of millions. Nobody has ever tried to force the pass and nobody\r\never will. The Russians usually allude to it as “the famous Georgian\r\nmilitary road,” and it is better known to military students than\r\ngeographers, and to strategists than to the public. The grand divide,\r\ncalled “Krestovaia Gora” (the Crest of the Cross), is forty-one miles\r\nfrom Vladicaucasus, and upon a ledge above it, at an altitude of 8,015\r\nfeet, is an obelisk surmounted by a cross attributed to Queen Tamara,\r\nwho ruled Georgia in the Middle Ages: and there, it is said, when that\r\namiable lady became tired of a lover, she would have him thrown over\r\nthe precipice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the road in Dariel Pass]\r\n\r\nGoing north from Tiflis the first place of interest is Mtskheta, the\r\nancient capital of the Georgian kings, which is now a humble and\r\nuninteresting village of two or three hundred people with the ruins\r\nof a large castle, two ancient Greek churches, and other evidences\r\nof former greatness. The place is fourteen miles from Tiflis on the\r\nrailway to Batoum, and people who care to do so can shorten their\r\njourney by taking a carriage there, although there is no decent place\r\nto stop. The surrounding country was inhabited by a prehistoric race\r\nof cave dwellers, even before the European invasion. Chambers have\r\nbeen chiselled out of the limestone cliffs of the foothills similar to\r\nthose in the cliffs of Arizona and were evidently inhabited by a large\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe Georgians claim to be the oldest of races and Mtskheta is one\r\nof the oldest cities in the world. It was founded, according to the\r\ntradition, by Karthlos, who was the son of Thargamos, who was the son\r\nof Gomar, who was the son of Japhet, who was the son of Noah, and came\r\nup here from Ararat after the flood to settle down in that lovely\r\ncountry. (See Genesis x. 3.) From him the royal line of Georgia sprang\r\nand Mtskheta was their capital. The city is described by Ptolemy, the\r\nEgyptian; by Strabo, the Greek; and by Pliny, the Roman geographer;\r\nand its wealth and power and influence in his land caused it to be\r\ncalled Dedakhalakhy which being translated into English means “the\r\nMother City.” Christianity was introduced among the Georgians by St.\r\nNina during the reign of King Meriam, in the year 322–324 A.D., and she\r\npersuaded them to tear down their pagan altars, to abandon their human\r\nsacrifices, and to accept the gospel of peace and love, although they\r\nhave not always lived up to it very closely. Of all the peoples in the\r\nworld, the Georgians have been the most consistent sinners.\r\n\r\nKing Meriam after his conversion built a church wherein to deposit “the\r\nseamless garment” of our Saviour, which was bought at the crucifixion\r\nby a Jew named Elioz. He purchased it of a soldier who won it by lot at\r\nthe foot of the cross. It was kept in that church for many centuries,\r\nand in 1656 was presented by the king of Georgia to the czar Boris\r\nGodunof of Russia, who placed it in the Cathedral of the Assumption in\r\nthe Kremlin at Moscow, where it may be seen to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the sanctuary where this precious relic was formerly kept, is a\r\npillar called the Samyrone (a Georgian word meaning “whence issues\r\nsacred oil”) which possesses the miraculous power of supplying the\r\nHoly Chrism with blood that oozes through its pores. This miracle\r\noccurs every year or two, and, although the Georgians are not noted\r\nfor their piety, thousands come every year to worship and to touch the\r\npillar with their fingers. In that way, they believe, they can cleanse\r\nthemselves from all diseases of the body and the soul.\r\n\r\nThis old church was the burial place of the kings of Georgia for\r\ncenturies, and although the tombs are not well kept and are neglected\r\nin a shameful manner, many of them are still splendid specimens of\r\nthe art of carving. In front of the tabernacle, where the robe of the\r\nSaviour was kept, is a reliquary containing what is believed to be a\r\nmonk’s habit worn by the prophet Elias. Tradition claims that he was a\r\nnative of Mtskheta, although there is no documentary evidence of that\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe dust of the last king of Georgia lies in a beautiful marble\r\nsarcophagus bearing the following inscription:\r\n\r\n“Here rests the Tzar George; born in 1750; ascended the throne of\r\nGeorgia in 1798. Desiring the welfare of his subjects and to secure\r\nthem forever in peace he ceded Georgia to the Russian Empire and died\r\nin 1801.\r\n\r\n“For the purpose of preserving to future generations the memory of the\r\nlast of the Georgian tzars, the Marquis Paolucci, commander-in-chief of\r\nthe Russian army, caused this monument to be erected in the name of His\r\nMajesty the Emperor Alexander I in the year 1812.”\r\n\r\nThe renunciation of the crown and the cession of the territory of\r\nGeorgia to Russia, as described above, were not approved by his family\r\nor his subjects. His queen accused him of cowardice and denounced him\r\nto the people. When the Russians attempted to take her to Moscow to\r\nprevent her from raising a rebellion, she drew a dagger from her breast\r\nand drove it into the heart of Gen. Ivan Petrovitch Lazareff, who\r\nexpired immediately.\r\n\r\nWhile she was being conveyed to Russia by General Toulthkoff an\r\nattempt to rescue her was made in the Dariel Pass and nearly every one\r\nof her escort were killed in the fight.\r\n\r\nAmong the other tombs is one bearing the following touching inscription:\r\n\r\n“I, Miriam, daughter of Davian, and Queen of Georgia, have taken\r\npossession of this little tomb. You who look upon it, remember me in\r\ncharity and pray for me, for the love of Jesus Christ.”\r\n\r\nOne of the early Christian kings of Georgia, named Ivane, who in 1123\r\ndelivered his country out of the hands of the Moslems, is identified\r\nas the mysterious Prester John who attracted a great deal of attention\r\nduring the Crusades and was the subject of much speculation and\r\nfrequent discussion. He was first brought to the notice of Europe by\r\nPope Eugene III as having been the saviour and defender of Christianity\r\nin this part of the world, but from the indefinite information it was\r\nimpossible to identify the original among several petty sovereigns in\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nSir John Mandeville, knight, in his “Narrative of Marvells,” written in\r\n1332, tells us more about this mysterious character than we have from\r\nany other source. He says:\r\n\r\n“The Emperor Prester John has been christened and a great part of his\r\nland also. They believe well in the Father, the Son, and the Holy\r\nGhost. The Emperor Prester John, when he goeth to battle, hath no\r\nbanner born before him, but he hath born before him three crosses of\r\nfine gold, large and great, and thickly set with precious stones. And\r\nwhen he hath no battle, but rideth to take the air, then hath he born\r\nbefore him a cross made of a tree.”\r\n\r\nIn all their history there seems to have been only one of their\r\nsovereigns of whom the Georgians are proud, and that was Queen Tamara,\r\nwho ruled all the territory between the Black and Caspian Seas, south\r\nof the Caucasus Mountains, from 1184 to 1212. That was the golden age\r\nof Georgia. Tamara seems to have been a mixture of masculine energy and\r\ncourage and feminine loveliness and grace, a Cleopatra and a Joan of\r\nArc in the same woman, combining the virtues of Queen Elizabeth and the\r\nvices of Catherine II. Her portraits are found in every household, she\r\nis credited with founding every monastery and every church of age, and\r\nseems to have had a castle in every corner of the country. Her throne\r\nmay be seen in the Kremlin at Moscow.\r\n\r\nPrince Aragva, the present representative of the Georgian dynasty,\r\na great-great-grandson of George XIII, who renounced his authority\r\nin favour of the Russian emperor in 1799, lives at Donchet, at the\r\nsouthern entrance to the Dariel Pass, an agricultural town of about\r\n3,500 inhabitants. He has large estates and an abundance of money and\r\nthe Russian authorities treat him with distinction. He spends most\r\nof his time in St. Petersburg and Paris, but cultivates, through his\r\nagents, a large and productive estate. He is said to have no ambition\r\nbut pleasure and realizes a good deal of that.\r\n\r\nThe railway across the Caucasus from Batoum, the port on the Black\r\nSea, to Baku, on the Caspian, is 558 miles long, although from the map\r\nthe strip of territory between those two bodies of water does not seem\r\nhalf so wide. The track follows the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains\r\nthrough the ancient state of Georgia on the southern and Asiatic side,\r\nand snow-capped peaks are in sight from the car windows nearly every\r\nday in the year during half the journey. The highest point reached\r\nby the train is 3,027 feet, where it passes through a long tunnel.\r\nThe railway was built by the Russian government for military purposes\r\nabout forty years ago, and is still under military control and managed\r\nby military methods. All the material and rolling stock came from the\r\ngovernment shops at Moscow; the engines burn oil for fuel and the\r\ntracks are five feet gauge.\r\n\r\nA squad of soldiers accompanies every train and occupies a car\r\nimmediately back of the locomotive, to guard the mails and the express\r\ncar, which often contains treasure and always many valuable packages.\r\nThis guard has been maintained ever since the revolution. The functions\r\nof the civil governor-general have been practically suspended for\r\nyears; the military commander exercises autocratic authority, and\r\nmartial law is enforced according to his judgment. That is, all crimes\r\nwhich he construes as being political are tried by military courts\r\nand punished by the military authorities, who have practically filled\r\nthe prisons with political offenders. Other crimes against person and\r\nproperty, which, in the judgment of the military authorities, have no\r\npolitical significance, are committed to the jurisdiction of the civil\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nNo part of Russia suffered so much from fire and sword during the\r\nrevolution of 1905–6 as the Caucasus, and many revolting stories are\r\ntold of the barbarities and horrors committed on both sides. But there\r\nis no use in reviving those disagreeable things. The terrible prison in\r\nthe citadel that crowns a hill overlooking the city of Tiflis is still\r\ncrowded with patriots whose zeal outran their judgment, and whose ideas\r\nof civil liberty are somewhat broader and more radical than we are\r\naccustomed to concede.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Georgian Peasant]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Georgian gentleman and wife]\r\n\r\nRussian anarchists who throw bombs at their rulers and blow up\r\nbarracks filled with sleeping soldiers in the name of God and liberty\r\nare not quite sane and are entitled to no sympathy. That is the most\r\ncharitable way to regard the awful crimes that have been committed in\r\nthe name of patriotism and liberty. The leaders of the insurrection\r\nhere look upon the French revolution as sacred history, and the\r\nprovince of the Caucasus has been the scene of many similar occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe land troubles in Ireland have not been a circumstance to those\r\nthat have occurred there, and the same fanatical spirit has been\r\ncarried into education and religion as well as into business. The\r\nGeorgian church is a branch of the orthodox Greek, with some minor and\r\ntechnical differences in theology and ritual. I have never been able\r\nto learn just what they are, and, indeed, no one seems to know, but\r\nthe Georgians refuse to commune with the Russians and would burn the\r\nRussian churches and massacre their priests if they could accomplish\r\nanything thereby. They are ultra fanatical in racial prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe Russians are not altogether blameless for this terrible situation,\r\nbecause they have attempted to force the Russian ritual and Russian\r\npriests upon unwilling parishes in many places, and have insisted that\r\nthe Russian language instead of the Georgian language shall be used in\r\nthe schools. Therefore the children are growing up in ignorance. No\r\nGeorgian parent will allow his children to attend a school where the\r\nRussian language is taught. He would probably suffer ostracism, if not\r\na worse punishment, if he did.\r\n\r\nThe railway from the Black Sea enters the mountains about 150 miles\r\nfrom Batoum and climbs up very slowly with two locomotives over a solid\r\ntrack between timber-crowned hills. There are forests of locust trees\r\nwhite with blossoms, whose perfume fills the air. The locust seems to\r\nbe popular and is not only planted around every station on the railway\r\nbut around all the dwelling houses, farm houses and the cottages in the\r\nvillages along the way. The farm houses look like timber claims in our\r\nWestern states, and all the trees are locusts. There are a good many\r\norchards and the quince and apple trees were in bloom when we made our\r\njourney. They seem to be well trimmed and cared for. The rocks along\r\nthe cañons are decorated with rhododendrons and yellow honeysuckles,\r\nwhich are in blossom in April, and you can fancy how beautiful a\r\nrailway right of way can be where the walls are covered with such\r\nfoliage on both sides. But the scenery is not so wild as I expected\r\nfrom the printed descriptions I had read.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the divide through a long tunnel at an elevation of 3,027\r\nfeet and dropped down rapidly into a lovely, wide, level valley, every\r\nacre of which is covered to-day with a carpet of living green. The city\r\nof Tiflis is 1,355 feet above the sea, about the same latitude as Rome,\r\nand has an annual rainfall of nineteen inches, which is sufficient to\r\nraise all kinds of staples of the temperate zone without irrigation.\r\nNotwithstanding the restless and turbulent disposition of the Georgian\r\nand other races who make up the population, the farming element seem\r\nto be industrious and prosperous, and although their houses and the\r\nmanner in which they live, their tools and implements would not be\r\ntolerated by an American farmer, their standards of comfort and luxury\r\nare not high; they would be, no doubt, contented if they had political\r\nliberty and were not so constantly reminded that they are the subjects\r\nno longer of a Georgian king, but of a Russian czar. If the government\r\nwould do something for them to promote their material interests they\r\nmight be more contented, but the Russian official regards the Georgians\r\nas an undisciplined and rebellious race, and as long as such relations\r\ncontinue there cannot be much improvement.\r\n\r\nLong trains of tank cars stood on the sidetracks at almost every\r\nstation, either loaded with oil for Batoum or empties on their way back\r\nto Baku to be refilled. One of the most important oil companies built\r\nits own pipe lines following the railway across the entire Caucasus\r\nfrom Baku to Batoum, but the weaker and less wealthy operators use the\r\nrailway. There is an odour of petroleum almost the entire distance,\r\nchiefly because the locomotives burn that kind of fuel, but also owing\r\nto the continual leakage of the tank cars along the track. The track\r\nbetween the rails is black with oil almost the entire distance between\r\nthe Caspian and the Black Seas, which keeps down the dust, although it\r\nis an accidental and not an intentional device.\r\n\r\nThe passenger cars are large, the seats are wide, low, and comfortable,\r\nand in the first-class coaches are arranged so that they can be made up\r\ninto beds at night like those in the ordinary European sleeping car,\r\nalthough every passenger who desires to utilize them in that way must\r\nbring his own sheets, blankets and pillow. The cars are divided into\r\ncompartments, and the only objection is that there is but one small,\r\nhigh window in each compartment, so that it is impossible to see the\r\ncountry you are passing through unless you stand up or go out into the\r\ncorridor, which is lighted in a similar way. The first-class passengers\r\nexcept ourselves were military officers and their families, and they\r\nall wore their uniforms and swords, high-topped boots and heavy\r\novercoats, notwithstanding the hot weather.\r\n\r\nThe first third of the distance from Batoum to Tiflis is a level plain,\r\ncalled a steppe in Russia, which is thoroughly cultivated, but the\r\nfarm homes are wretched wooden hovels. We saw the women working in the\r\nfields--which they have to do to keep the pot boiling, for the men are\r\nin the army, drawing no wages and producing nothing.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of timber, and we saw several droves of\r\nscraggy-looking cattle on the hillsides. Most of the cultivated land\r\nis planted to wheat and other grains. At every stopping place a\r\nportion of the platform at the end of the station house is surrendered\r\nto vegetable sellers, usually old women, who have onions, lettuce,\r\nradishes, and other garden truck piled up on little trays around\r\nthem and seemed to be doing a good business. Boys peddled baskets of\r\nstrawberries under the windows of the cars--and they were swindles,\r\nof course. When we had eaten off a couple of layers we found nothing\r\nbut leaves. They offered us cherries in attractive form, the stems of\r\nthe fruit ingeniously inserted through slits in a stick, making long\r\nred wands, some of them three feet long. There are refreshment stands\r\nat every station, at which tea, sausages, sandwiches, bread, cheese,\r\nand other edibles are offered, and the train makes long stops so that\r\nthe passengers have time to drink a cup of tea or a glass of vodka and\r\nto exercise on the platform. At every station tanks of cold water and\r\nsamovars of hot water are provided free for third-class passengers, who\r\ncan help themselves and make their own tea, as most of them do.\r\n\r\nThe running time was very slow with the long stops, and it took us\r\nthirteen hours to make 228 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CITY OF TIFLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable James Bryce, British Ambassador to Washington,\r\nwho visited Tiflis thirty-five years ago or more, on his way to climb\r\nMount Ararat, described that city as “a human melting pot, a city of\r\ncontrasts and mixtures, into which elements have been poured from half\r\nEurope and Asia and in which they as yet show no signs of combining.\r\nThe most interesting thing about it,” he said, “is the city itself,\r\nthe strange mixture of so many races, tongues, religions, customs. Its\r\ncharacter lies in the fact that it has no character, but ever so many\r\ndifferent ones. Here all these people live side by side, buying and\r\nselling and working for hire, yet never coming into any closer union,\r\nremaining indifferent to one another, with neither love nor hate nor\r\nambition, peaceably obeying a government of strangers who conquered\r\nthem without resistance and retains them without effort, and held\r\ntogether by no bond but its existence. Of national life or numerical\r\nlife there is not the first faint glimmer; indeed, the aboriginal\r\npeople of the country seem scarcely less strangers in its streets than\r\ndo all the other races that tread them.”\r\n\r\nThere are said to be seventy different languages spoken on the streets\r\nof Tiflis, or at least so many dialects of the various races of Europe\r\nand Asia who have been attracted there by business and other interests\r\nand in search of employment. Many of the dialects belong to the same\r\nparent language; many of the races sprang from the same stock, but\r\neach has acquired a certain individuality by reason of its environment\r\nand the conditions under which it has been living. As Mr. Bryce says:\r\n“Probably nowhere else in all the world can so great a variety of\r\nstocks, languages, and religions be found huddled together in so narrow\r\nan area. All these races live together, not merely within the limits\r\nof the same country, a country politically and physically one, but to\r\na great extent actually on the same soil, mixed up with and crossing\r\none another. In one part Georgians, in another Armenians, in a third\r\nTartars, predominate, but there are large districts where Armenians\r\nand Georgians; or Armenians, Georgians, and Tartars; or Tartars\r\nand Persians; or Persians, Tartars, and Armenians, are so equally\r\nrepresented in point of numbers that it is difficult to say which\r\nelement predominates. This phenomenon is strange to one who knows only\r\nthe homogeneous population of west European countries, or of a country\r\nlike America, where all sorts of elements are day by day being flung\r\ninto their melting pot and lose their identity almost at once.”\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Bryce wrote thirty-five years ago of Tiflis is equally true\r\nto-day. Perhaps it is even more true than it was then because of the\r\nincrease of population. Tiflis is twice as large by the census of 1905\r\nas it was in 1875, when he was here. Tiflis already has two hundred\r\nthousand population, and is growing rapidly. A bird’s-eye view of this\r\ncurious old town can be obtained by taking a funicular, or inclined\r\nplane, railway to the top of a bluff, where there are a restaurant, tea\r\nhouses, a merry-go-round, and other simple amusements which are much\r\npatronized by the working classes. Standing upon a platform, you can\r\ntake in the whole panorama. The different sections of the town can be\r\npointed out to you--the Russian, German, Georgian, Persian, Armenian,\r\nand Tartar quarters, with the brown river dividing them and the roofs\r\npainted in different colours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Principal Club at Tiflis]\r\n\r\nWherever you see a group of dark crimson roofs you may know that\r\nthey cover Russian soldiers, for that is the colour of their\r\nbarracks, selected, a cynical friend remarked, by accident and not by\r\ndesign--although it is very appropriate to the business upon which the\r\ngarrisons are engaged. The Armenians paint their roofs a copper green\r\nor silver gilt, similar to the steeples on their churches, which are\r\nugly-looking cylinders with tin caps shaped like a cartridge, although\r\nthe cross that springs from the top of each sanctifies it. They are\r\nin striking contrast with the Byzantine domes of the orthodox Greek\r\nchurch. There are two sects, the Russian and the Georgian, who disagree\r\nmore from racial than from theological incompatibility. The Greek domes\r\nare of the shape of an inverted turnip and are painted blue, which adds\r\nto the picturesqueness of the scene.\r\n\r\nYou can see several mosques patronized by the Persian Mohammedans,\r\nbut they are shabby, dirty places, without the slightest attractive\r\nfeature, and very poor places for any respectable person to pray in.\r\nJudging from their houses of worship, the Persians have not much\r\nrespect for their own religion, although they look thoughtful and\r\nearnest and sincere, and pray aloud like the Pharisees of the Bible,\r\nregardless of others, and the sounds from a mosque are often like a\r\nhubbub.\r\n\r\nWe went into a mosque in the tailors’ quarter one morning and saw\r\nan old Persian priest with whiskers dyed a vivid scarlet. I asked\r\nNaskidoff, our dragoman, why the old man made himself look so\r\nridiculous, and he explained that it is the fashion--that is all. As\r\nthe priest is the only man in Tiflis I had seen so decorated, he must\r\nbe introducing the style and is not receiving much encouragement.\r\n\r\nThere are several other cities in the Caucasus, but none of any\r\nimportance, and Tiflis, being the political capital, with a viceroy;\r\nthe military headquarters, with a force of 135,000 men; and the centre\r\nof ecclesiastical jurisdiction, there is much beside commercial\r\nbusiness and agriculture to draw the people there. The city is divided\r\nalmost equally by the river Kur, a swift, muddy stream about the colour\r\nof strong coffee, which is confined to a narrow cañon, with steep walls\r\nof stone, where it dashes through the town. There is a great waste of\r\nmanufacturing power, which might be profitably utilized, but, with\r\nthe exception of some curious floating flour mills, I did not see any\r\nmechanical industries.\r\n\r\nThese flour mills are built of wood, and at first glance look like bath\r\nhouses. Each of them has a big water wheel, which turns the stones.\r\nThe houses are supported on the water by a sort of catamaran, a wide\r\nfloat being underneath the mill and a narrow one on the other side of\r\nthe power wheel. They are anchored near the banks, and their position\r\ncan be shifted according to the will of the owner. Usually each of\r\nthem has a little warehouse barge attached, where the raw material and\r\nthe finished product are stored, and if you will watch you can see men\r\ngoing back and forth between the sawmill ship and the shore carrying\r\nbags upon their backs.\r\n\r\nAt the eastern end of the town is a narrow pass between two rocky\r\nhills, which seems to have been cut by the water. The walls are\r\nprecipitous--one hundred feet or more above the river. On one side\r\nthe bluff is crowned by a citadel strongly fortified. It commands\r\nthe entire city. A few shells from one of the guns could utterly\r\ndestroy both the business and the residence sections. Within these\r\nfortifications is a repulsive looking prison, said to be crowded with\r\npolitical offenders. Strangers are not invited to visit the place, and\r\nthey are likely to make themselves unpopular by discussing it.\r\n\r\nThe Russian section is new and modern, with wide, clean streets, good\r\nsidewalks, an opera house, a theatre, a club, and a military museum\r\nor “Temple of Glory,” as they call it. There trophies won by Russian\r\narms, battle flags, portraits and relics of military heroes and other\r\ninteresting mementoes, have been collected, with several battle\r\npictures and other representations of war. One of the pictures, painted\r\non a mammoth canvas, represents the entrance of the Russian army into\r\nTiflis in 1808, when the king of Georgia asked Alexander I to come down\r\nand protect him against the Persians; another represents a treaty being\r\nnegotiated in a forest between a native chief and a Russian general;\r\nbut the most interesting of all is a relief map of the Caucasus which\r\nshows you at a glance the extraordinary configuration of this part of\r\nthe earth. Bronze tablets inscribed with records of all the battles\r\nfought by the Russian soldiers in the Caucasus from 1567 to 1878 have\r\nbeen embedded in panels in the outer walls of the museum, which are\r\nof great historical value. They give the number of men engaged and the\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\nThe principal street of the town is called Golovinski Prospekt, in\r\nimitation of the Nevsky Prospekt of St. Petersburg, and it is a\r\nfashionable promenade.\r\n\r\nTo the east of this clean Russian town is the Persian quarter, as\r\ngenuine as any city of Persia, with narrow, crooked streets and mud\r\nhouses of only one or two stories, which were built when the Persians\r\noccupied this country. On both sides of the street are little shops,\r\nlike closets, set back into the walls, not more than six or eight feet\r\nsquare, with no light or ventilation except that which comes through\r\nthe door. Each line of business has a street or a covered arcade to\r\nitself. The rug dealers are all in one street, the silversmiths and\r\ngoldsmiths in another; the hat makers, the dry-goods dealers, the\r\nhardware men, the butchers, the bakers, and even the bath houses and\r\nthe barbers are segregated like the tailors and the dealers in kitchen\r\nutensils, which is a great convenience.\r\n\r\nOne whole street is given up to barbers, who do a big business, for the\r\nPersians shave their heads instead of their faces. All the bath houses\r\nare on one street, which seems to be well patronized also. Naskidoff,\r\nwho knows everything, says the Persians wait until they are very dirty\r\nand then go and take a long, hot bath.\r\n\r\nMany of the merchants make their own goods and work at their own trade\r\nin their shops where their customers can see them. The Persians are\r\npetty merchants; the Georgians manufacture arms and are gold and silver\r\nsmiths. Their handiwork is rude but artistic; that is, they show more\r\ntaste than skill. They run to belts, daggers, revolver handles,\r\ncups, flagons, filigree buttons, and saddle ornaments, which the\r\nGeorgians covet more than virtue. They do some very clever work by\r\ninlaying steel with silver and gold, but it is not so fine or so\r\nartistic as the cloisonné of Japan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Floating Flour Mill, Tiflis]\r\n\r\nThe Armenians are the big dealers, the bankers, the money lenders,\r\nand, like most prosperous people, are the object of jealousy and\r\nresentment. I was told that when an Armenian loans money he expects to\r\nhave it repaid. His business reputation is fine, but the people who owe\r\nhim money hate him. All the Armenians are thrifty, industrious, and\r\ntemperate, and do not waste their substance in riotous living.\r\n\r\nThe Tartars, who have their own section of the town, hate the Armenians\r\nmore than the Persians do, not only because of a difference of\r\ntemperament and habits of life, but because the Tartars and Persians\r\nare Mohammedans and the Armenians are Christians. The Tartars are the\r\ntoughest of the lot. They are kindly and loyal but hot-headed, with a\r\nfondness for a fight and strong drink, notwithstanding the prohibition\r\nof the Koran. When a Tartar lets himself go, other people are wise to\r\ngive him the right of way, particularly when he wears a knife at his\r\nbelt and “totes” a couple of guns. He abominates the Armenians, who are\r\na constant moral reproach to him, and makes no effort to conceal his\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nUpon the summit of a mighty rock, upon a promontory projecting from\r\na ridge rising several hundred feet above the river that bathes its\r\nbase, is an old citadel built in the twelfth century by Georgian kings\r\nto defend Tiflis against Persian invasion. It is a mighty mass of\r\nbrick masonry but was abandoned a hundred years ago. The ruins are\r\nwell cared for and the government has made a botanical garden which is\r\nvery creditable in the old moat and the approaches that surround the\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\nI noticed a number of American trees tagged in English with the\r\nbotanical and the common names and acknowledgments to the Agricultural\r\nDepartment at Washington, from which they came.\r\n\r\nAcross the gulch which surrounds the garden is a gloomy old cemetery\r\nfilled with Tartar tombs. They spell the name “Tatar” now, and say\r\nthat it is the only proper way, but you must admit that it isn’t\r\nso forcible. “Timour the Tartar” could only have been a bold and\r\nbelligerent Oriental chieftain, with a dozen wives and a stable of\r\nArabian chargers with manes and tails like thunderclouds and hoofs shod\r\nwith fire. “Timour the Tatar” might just as well have been a cook.\r\n\r\nAnd what would become of the old saying, more familiar to England\r\nthan to us, if they adopt the new way of spelling? How would it sound\r\nto say: “Scratch a Russian and you find a Tatar?” They pronounce it\r\n“Tottaar-r-r” in a most savage way, putting all the r’s on the end\r\ninstead of leaving one for the first syllable.\r\n\r\nThe Tartars are as careless and indifferent about money matters as the\r\nArmenians are keen and cunning, and are always in debt to the latter,\r\nwhich makes hatred, of course. No man loves his creditors. The Tartars,\r\nwho are Mohammedans, abominate the Armenians as much as the Kurds do,\r\nfirst, because they are Christians; second, because they are money\r\nmakers, economical, frugal, and thrifty; and, finally, because they\r\nwon’t fight. The Tartars care nothing for money nor for property of any\r\nkind, except that they love their horses and their wives and children\r\nalike and are extremely jealous of all three. The family attachment and\r\ndevotion of this rough and turbulent race is said to be an example for\r\nall the rest of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe Tartars have been the terror of Asia for centuries. You have\r\nread, of course, about the invasions of the Tartar hordes from time\r\nto time that have overrun the eastern part of Europe. They are always\r\nfierce, always restless, and do not thrive under the restraints of\r\ncivilization. A Tartar will fight his weight in wildcats on any\r\nprovocation, but an Armenian is a man of peace.\r\n\r\nNot long ago there was an international row here between these two\r\nraces, whose settlements adjoin on the east side of the river. I cannot\r\nfind out how it began but it was over some trifle that everybody has\r\nforgotten. It waxed more serious daily, and when the Armenians, who\r\nhave been butchered mercilessly for ages in Turkey as well as in the\r\nCaucasus, saw the bloodthirsty Tartars sharpening their knives, they\r\nsent a committee to the viceroy to plead for protection. The viceroy,\r\nwho is a humane man, understood the situation, but naturally did not\r\ncare to butt in for fear of exciting animosity against the government.\r\nHence he instructed the leaders of both races to appoint committees of\r\nrepresentative men to discuss the troubles with him.\r\n\r\nThe delegates were selected and came to the palace; they went over the\r\nhistory of the feud from its primal causes to the present moment, and\r\nthen each side submitted arguments. The viceroy, having heard them\r\nthrough, dodged the issue, and told them that it was not a matter for\r\nthe government to meddle with, but one which they must settle among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“You are all rational, sensible, business men of intelligence and\r\nexperience,” he said, “and it is absurd that you should quarrel over\r\nsuch trifles as you bring here for me to settle. The government does\r\nnot propose to take any part in your controversy; it is too trivial to\r\nwaste our time about, and now I simply ask you to sit down together\r\nlike sensible men and settle it among yourselves,” and with that he\r\ndismissed the delegation.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Armenian committee received a challenge from the\r\nTartar committee demanding that it select one or two hundred men, or as\r\nmany as it pleased, of the best fighting Armenians in Tiflis, to go out\r\ninto the country and fight to the death with an equal number of Tartars.\r\n\r\nThe Armenians returned a scornful reply. They are better at writing\r\nthan at fighting. With great dignity and decorum they rebuked the\r\nTartars for suggesting such a barbarous method of settling a quarrel in\r\nthe twentieth century of human civilization.\r\n\r\nThe Tartars reported that the Armenians were cowards and offered to\r\ngive them odds of two to one, but the Armenians refused to discuss the\r\nsubject any further, and kept inside their doors as closely as possible\r\nuntil the excitement died down.\r\n\r\nThere is no unity among the seventy races of Tiflis, there is no common\r\nnational feeling; there is nothing upon which patriotism could be\r\nbased. No two of the many races represented here are on amicable terms,\r\nexcept the Germans, who mind their own business and are friendly to\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Georgian Cavalier]\r\n\r\nThere is no loyalty to the czar and nothing to inspire it. The\r\nadministration of the Caucasus is purely military. The first thought\r\nin the Russian mind is conquest. After that there is no other thought\r\nbut to retain possession. Instead of planting trees and encouraging\r\nthe people to improve their methods of agriculture, the Russians build\r\nfortresses, and instead of building school-houses they build barracks.\r\nThe railway across the province and that which runs down to the\r\nPersian border were primarily for the movement of troops, and military\r\nsupplies are given preference over all other freight. The famous road\r\nthrough the Caucasus Mountains is for military purposes rather than for\r\ncommerce. At least one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers are kept on\r\na war footing in this province alone. That number of men are not only\r\nwithdrawn from the fields and factories, and the number of producers\r\nthus reduced, but the peasants who work the farms, the shopkeepers and\r\nother peaceful members of the population, are taxed to pay for their\r\nsupport, which is a continual grievance that cannot be removed. If the\r\nmoney that is spent upon military purposes could be devoted to material\r\ndevelopment and the education of the people the army would not be\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nAll the influential and lucrative offices are held by imported\r\nRussians, although clerkships and other minor positions are given to\r\nnatives. The province of the Caucasus, which is north of the mountain\r\nrange, and that of the trans-Caucasus, which is south, are governed by\r\nautocrats who are directly responsible to the czar, and to him alone.\r\nSeveral members of the imperial family have occupied the posts which\r\nwere considered desirable until the revolution.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it should be explained that the Russians are there by\r\ninvitation. More than a hundred years ago the Georgian king voluntarily\r\nappealed for the protection of Alexander I, against the aggressiveness\r\nof Aga Mohammed Khan, a Persian invader, and in 1801 he signed a treaty\r\nof practical annexation to Russia with Alexander I. There is a fine\r\nlarge historical picture by a Georgian artist in the military museum\r\nhere representing the enthusiasm manifested by the people when the\r\nRussian troops entered the city of Tiflis and the Russian governor\r\nassumed authority.\r\n\r\nThe political situation here is practically the same as that in\r\nPoland. Georgia is a conquered province. It was added to the Russian\r\nEmpire without the consent of the people. They are Russian subjects by\r\ncompulsion and they do not like it. Their former king appealed to the\r\nRussians for protection against the Persians more than a century ago;\r\nthe Russians responded to the appeal and have “assimilated” the kingdom\r\nof Georgia as they did the kingdom of Poland.\r\n\r\nAll the big buildings are barracks. The garrison of Tiflis is\r\nthirty-five thousand soldiers, and that does not seem to be sufficient\r\nto keep the people in order. There are soldiers everywhere. Every other\r\nman you meet on the street wears a uniform; almost every guest at\r\nthe hotel is a general or a colonel, and every first-class passenger\r\non the railway trains is an officer of rank. They are a fine-looking\r\nlot of men, and their uniforms are very conspicuous, being of a light\r\nbluish gray, with an abundance of gold braid. A Russian officer is\r\nnever out of uniform and never parts from his sword. In the railway\r\ntrains, in the restaurants, even at church, he is heavily armed, and\r\nevery officer seems to wear his winter overcoat in this hot weather\r\nwhich is difficult to understand. There may be a regulation requiring\r\nofficers to wear overcoats twelve months in the year, regardless of the\r\ntemperature, and that is the only way we can explain it.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at St. Petersburg, as a matter\r\nof convenience for the transaction of business, has an annex here,\r\nand a sub-secretary of foreign affairs who deals with Persia, the\r\nemir of Bokhara, and other Asiatic princes under Russian protection.\r\nHe receives his instructions from St. Petersburg, but is allowed a\r\ngood deal of discretion in dealing with matters of official business.\r\nThe present incumbent of that office is a very agreeable gentleman,\r\nLoukainow Stanislavovitchou Kokhanowskiomou, to whom I had a letter\r\nof introduction, but fortunately I was not compelled to pronounce his\r\nname. I could properly address him as “Excellency.” He occupies a\r\ncommodious house not far from the viceroy’s palace, comporting with the\r\ndignity and importance of his office, and has a collection of rugs and\r\nOriental embroideries that a connoisseur would covet.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency has handled the Persian question with a great deal\r\nof diplomatic skill and keeps the British government in a perpetual\r\nfidget, but the policy of Russia can never be mistaken. The czar\r\nproposes to control Asia, regardless of the opposition of Great Britain\r\nand all whom it may concern. Because of the stupendous folly of her own\r\nagents Russia lost her hold on China and all that she had gained during\r\nthe last thirty years in her advance toward the East. All this will\r\nhave to be done over again, but the preparations have begun and the\r\nwork is under way.\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs here may be judged by the manner in which\r\nthe mail is carried through the streets between the railway station\r\nand the post-office. There is a military guard on every train, always\r\noccupying the car next to the locomotive, and at every station when the\r\ntrain stops the soldiers are the first to alight and assume defensive\r\npositions. This is in addition to the local police, who are also in\r\nevidence in every direction. When a train comes into Tiflis the guard\r\nalights and takes a position around the mail and express car, where\r\nit remains until all the passengers have disembarked and gone their\r\nway. Then when the mail car is opened, the bags and express packages\r\nof value are placed in steel safes, which are lifted upon light wagons\r\ndrawn by three horses. When the transfer is made the horses start on a\r\ndead run for the post-office, led by a drosky containing two heavily\r\narmed men and entirely surrounded by a squad of Cossacks, the famous\r\nRough Riders, every one of them with a cocked rifle across the pommel\r\nof his saddle. These precautions are said to be necessary because on\r\nseveral occasions mail has been held up and destroyed and valuable\r\nexpress packages have been stolen by gangs of men representing the\r\nsocial revolutionary party.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory section of Tiflis is called by everybody “the\r\nColony.” It is a settlement of between four and five thousand Germans\r\nfrom Wurtemberg, who came to southern Russia early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury by invitation of Catherine the Great. She gave them lands,\r\nguaranteed them the free exercise of their religious beliefs, and\r\nexemption from military service forever. The latter pledge was violated\r\nduring the war between Russia and Turkey in 1877, and since that time\r\nthe Germans have been compelled to serve their five years in the\r\narmy with all other Russian subjects, although they take no part in\r\npolitics and have no social relations with the Russians, but are very\r\nexclusive and tenacious in their adherence to the customs and habits of\r\nthe fatherland.\r\n\r\nThere are fifty thousand Wurtembergers in the Caucasus and they are\r\npretty well scattered, but always in colonies, this one at Tiflis being\r\nthe largest. They left their native country because the government\r\nattempted to compel them to sing from a new hymn book which they did\r\nnot consider orthodox, and rather than submit they abandoned the homes\r\nof their fathers and sought new ones in a far country where they could\r\nworship God in their own way.\r\n\r\nCatherine II was a great colonizer, and they have been valuable\r\ncolonists. They are the best mechanics and the best farmers in the\r\ncountry. They have minded their own business, maintained their own\r\nschools, built Lutheran churches, accumulated property, sung the dear\r\nold hymns, increased in numbers, and flourished in a phlegmatic sort of\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe members of “the Colony,” as it is always called, have never\r\nattempted to proselyte the Russians or other neighbours, but are\r\nfanatical in their Protestantism, which prevents them from marrying\r\nor even mixing with believers in other faiths. They have a wholesome\r\nProtestant contempt for Mohammedans and also for the Armenians. They\r\nregard the former as worse than heathens and the latter as treacherous,\r\ndeceitful, and insincere in their professions of the Christian creed.\r\nThey speak nothing but German among themselves, although they are\r\ncompelled to use Russian in their business transactions. “The Colony”\r\nwas originally a distinct town, but when the railway was built into\r\nTiflis the station was located on the farther edge of the settlement,\r\nand since that time the gap has been filled and the Germans have\r\nbecome surrounded with Russians, Persians, Armenians, Tartars, and\r\nrepresentatives of the numerous other races which form the population\r\nhere. But they have maintained their exclusiveness just the same. They\r\nhave their own beer gardens and places of entertainment, as well as\r\ntheir own church and schools, and they confine their trade to their own\r\nrace so far as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Lutheran church is a large, fine building, and attached to it,\r\nunder the direction of Pastor Mayer, is a school for the education of\r\nteachers, missionaries, ministers, and other religious workers for\r\nthe many German colonists throughout the Caucasus. Four miles in the\r\ncountry is a German farming settlement, resembling an agricultural\r\nvillage in the fatherland, as closely as it is possible here, with big\r\nstables, cattle-yards, and pigstyes, and evidences of German thrift on\r\nevery side. Their orchard fruits, their strawberries and garden truck,\r\nare always the first and the best in the market and bring the highest\r\nprices, and they furnish a valuable object lesson for the Russian and\r\nGeorgian farmers which, however, is not imitated so closely as it might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Palace of the Viceroy, Tiflis]\r\n\r\nThe viceroy’s palace is a miniature copy of the winter palace at St.\r\nPetersburg, of the same architectural design and painted the same\r\nterra-cotta colour, although it is not more than one tenth the size.\r\nIt stands upon the principal street, with a large garden in the rear,\r\nand across the street are the barracks of the guards, which seem to be\r\nneeded. Wooden barriers have been placed upon the sidewalk to prevent\r\nunauthorized persons from approaching near enough to the building\r\nto do any harm, as some of the people down there have a nasty way\r\nof throwing bombs about, and the posts and railing are painted in\r\nstripes like barbers’ poles. The viceroy’s guards wear the Georgian\r\nuniform, with red coats. They are striking-looking fellows, who are\r\noften mistaken for Cossacks, and the sentinels add a touch of colour\r\nto the picture. There is usually a drosky, drawn by a beautiful black\r\nstallion, awaiting orders at the entrance, and the isvostchik, as the\r\ndriver is called, is well worth looking at.\r\n\r\nPrince Woronzoff Dashoff, the viceroy, has been there many years and\r\nis popular with the people, who regard him as a just and humane man,\r\nbut they complain that his authority has been limited to such a degree\r\nthat he is practically a figurehead representing the emperor, while the\r\nmilitary commander rules the country. I wouldn’t wonder if there was a\r\ngood deal of truth in the complaint, but the Georgians are in a state\r\nof chronic rebellion and martial law prevails throughout the province.\r\nThere has been no peace but that of the sword and the torch since the\r\n1905–6 revolution and the granting of a constitution several years ago,\r\nand there will be no peace until the government gives the Georgians a\r\nshow by recognizing their racial individuality and permitting them to\r\nuse their ancestral language and enjoy a liberal measure of home rule.\r\n\r\nThe more we saw of both the men and women of Georgia the better we\r\nappreciate the reputation they have among the beauties of the world.\r\nYou could not find a finer looking lot of men in any city in the world\r\nthan you meet on the streets of Tiflis, and the women have all the\r\ncharms they have been credited with, although it is said that they\r\nbecome fat early in life from indolence and sweetmeats. Perhaps dress\r\nhas a good deal to do with setting off the shape and the features of\r\nthe men. I have heard that fine feathers make fine birds. No national\r\ncostume is more stately or adds more to the stature and the pose of a\r\nwearer. Perhaps the high-stepping heroes of romance and tragedy whom\r\nwe were constantly meeting on the sidewalk would not look so well in\r\nan ordinary suit of store clothes, but one can at least give them the\r\ncredit of wearing their ancestral garments with stunning effect.\r\n\r\nA certain Georgian dandy patronized the Hotel de Londres, where we were\r\nstopping, to excess. It was remarked that so long as he continues to\r\nspend his money so freely there, the bustling little German lady who\r\nkeeps the house will never fail to make an annual profit. He is said\r\nto be very rich, and is a prince, of course. The gossips reported that\r\nhe had a quarrel with his brother, and as the two were partners he was\r\nspending the money of the firm more freely than was prudent. But that\r\nis neither here nor there. We only asked the privilege of admiring his\r\nclothes and his poses. We were not responsible for his moral behaviour\r\nand would continue to admire him even if his reputation was twice as\r\nbad as it is.\r\n\r\nHe wore a different coat and a different dagger and a different shako\r\nevery day, and they always matched. He had coats of white, blue, red,\r\ngray, brown, and a mixed colour like Irish homespun. The tunic that he\r\nwore under them was always of a colour to make a striking contrast.\r\nWhen his overcoat was red, it would be white, and when his overcoat\r\nwas white, the tunic would be red. He must have had a large armoury of\r\ndaggers and pistols, for he seldom wore the same ones, and we liked\r\nthose with plain ivory handles the best. He was a moving picture unlike\r\nanything you can see outside of Georgia.\r\n\r\nAnd then we had another prince with a good reputation, one of the best\r\nmen in the province, a man of great wealth and eminent respectability,\r\nwho was stopping at the hotel with his two little sons. The boys wore\r\nthe national dress, like their father, and with the same dignity and\r\ngrace. And we must not forget the Paderewski hair, which is quite\r\nfashionable among gentlemen of literary and musical taste. I do not\r\nknow how they make it stick out as they do, but I have seen heads that\r\na bushel basket would not cover. It is fine hair, too, not coarse and\r\nrough and vulgar. You see such bushy heads upon real, live, ordinary\r\nmen frequently upon the streets, with the hair bulging out below shakos\r\nof lamb’s-skin like the curls of the Circassian beauty in the sideshow\r\nof a circus.\r\n\r\nOne would never tire of the fantastic costumes that are to be seen at\r\nevery railway station. The men wear tall chimney-pot hats of Persian\r\nlamb-skin, which look very heavy and very hot, and you wonder how they\r\ncan endure them in the summer weather. The hats must weigh several\r\npounds, but if you ask the wearers they will tell you that the weight\r\nis nothing; and that, like the Irishman’s sheepskin coat, the fur keeps\r\nthe heat out in summer as it keeps the cold out in winter.\r\n\r\nTheir long coats of homespun are of varied colours. We are accustomed\r\nto see the Cossacks at Buffalo Bill’s great moral show in dark gray\r\ncoats, but the Georgians, whose costume is precisely similar in every\r\nparticular, affect bright colours--reds and blues of various shades,\r\ngrays, and browns, as well as whites and blacks, according to their\r\ntaste, and some of them have their shakos of Persian lamb dyed the same\r\nshade as their coats. Many Georgian gentlemen wear beautiful cloaks of\r\nheavy cloth as thick as a board, with a pile heavier than that of plush\r\nand curled like Astrakhan wool. We were told that this material is\r\nhomespun too, and it makes a stunning garment.\r\n\r\nEvery gentleman wears high top boots outside of his trousers, which are\r\nvery loose and hang over his boot tops like the knickerbockers of an\r\nEnglish school-boy. Sometimes the boots are embroidered in colours over\r\nthe shin and down the calf of the leg. And every gentleman wears an\r\narsenal in his girdle, consisting of richly mounted knives and pistols,\r\nwhich look very formidable, but I am told are seldom used.\r\n\r\nA Georgian dandy is a great sight, and you see them everywhere in the\r\nCaucasus. The most perfect costume and the most becoming to their dark\r\ncomplexions, intensely black hair and beards, and their glowing black\r\neyes is, I think, a pure white coat and a shako of white lamb’s-wool.\r\nAnd with that colour the Georgian gentleman usually wears a long\r\ndagger with an ivory handle and an ivory sheath and a revolver mounted\r\nto match; although other people might fancy a gentleman done up in\r\nscarlet, who is also worth looking at.\r\n\r\nThe costumes of the women are not so fancy as those of the men, and\r\nare mostly head dress and veil. They do not wear bright colours like\r\ntheir husbands and brothers, but chiefly black. The head dress is\r\na little skull cap about an inch high made of black velvet, with\r\nthe top embroidered in silver or gold braid. It is worn low on the\r\nforehead and over it a square of lace or chiffon hanging down over the\r\nshoulders to the waist, either embroidered or trimmed with edging all\r\naround. There is as much difference in the quality of the veil as there\r\nis in the incomes of the wearers. But it is the principal feature of\r\nthe costume, and the effect is studied accordingly. Some of the veils\r\nare of Venetian point, others of Brussels lace, and you often see very\r\nfine examples, but most of them are from the local lacemakers or made\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nThe hair is dressed in four curls, two hanging down in front of the\r\nears upon the breast and two down the back. As the glory of a Georgian\r\nwoman is her hair, her curls are usually conspicuous and kept with\r\ngreat neatness. Sometimes they reach below the waist.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the costume is a jacket, either sleeveless or with slashed\r\nsleeves, a frill of lace or a silk handkerchief embroidered in bright\r\ncolours around the neck and crossed upon the breast as a Quakeress\r\nwould wear it, and from the waist in front hang two broad ribbons or\r\nstrips of silk edged with a different colour, like an apron.\r\n\r\nThe costume varies as to the quality of the material and the amount\r\nof embroidery according to the means of the wearer. The entire dress\r\nis notable for its refinement. Although we saw few of the dazzling\r\nbeauties for which Georgia has always been famous, it is probably\r\nour own fault, or rather our misfortune. The best-looking women in\r\nany country are not in the habit of going to the railway stations or\r\npromenading in the parks. We noticed several ladies with beautiful and\r\nrefined faces in the shops, and often passed them driving--sufficient\r\nto justify a confirmation of the stories we have heard about the clear\r\nolive complexions, the regular features, the Egyptian eyes, and the\r\nmidnight hair, which are the gifts of the women of the Georgian race.\r\n\r\nIt’s a joke among the Russians that every Georgian is a nobleman and\r\nthat your porter or drosky driver is certain to be a baron or perhaps\r\na count. It is undoubtedly true that titles were once bestowed with\r\nlavish generosity by the Georgian kings, who paid their debts as\r\nwell as rewarded merit by conferring rank promiscuously. A gentleman\r\nremarked the other day, however, that the only title worth taking off\r\nyour hat to is that of a prince. Every large land owner is a prince.\r\nI do not know that it is necessary for him to have any given area.\r\nAs a rule, a Georgian nobleman looks and dresses the part much more\r\nnaturally than Russian or other European dukes and princes.\r\n\r\nThe national pride is equally amusing--pride of ancestry, pride of\r\nrace, pride of costume, pride of children; and, as John G. Saxe\r\nwrote of a similar case, they are proud of their pride. To this\r\ncharacteristic we are indebted for much pleasure. It induces them to\r\ncling to their national costumes and even to the gilded daggers at\r\ntheir belts.\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of this is found in a Georgian shrine opposite\r\nthe Hotel de Londres, at the principal gateway to a pretty little park\r\nin Tiflis. There you can see a mosaic icon, representing a full-length\r\nfigure of the Saviour in the most gorgeous variety of the Georgian\r\ncostume. He is dressed in a long bowrka, or overcoat, faced or lined\r\nwith ermine; under this a scarlet tunic and loose blue trousers, tucked\r\ninto high-topped leather boots. He wears a green girdle into which a\r\nrevolver and a dagger with beautifully enamelled handles are thrust;\r\nupon His breast are silver kilebi, the cases where cartridges are\r\nusually carried, and on His head is a tall nabadi, or stove-pipe\r\nhat, of black Persian lamb’s-wool--Jesus of Nazareth in the raiment of\r\na Georgian dandy!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Georgian Prince]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Patriarch of the Georgian Church, Tiflis]\r\n\r\nThe peasants seem to approve of it, notwithstanding the incongruity,\r\nand we loved to watch them from our windows, thousands every day, for\r\nthe park is much frequented by workingmen at the noon and evening hours\r\nof rest. Every one who passes invariably kneels, crosses himself, and\r\nmurmurs a prayer, and many kiss the glass that covers the feet of\r\nthis Christ, who is clad according to the peasants’ dream of what the\r\nRedeemer should be.\r\n\r\nThe Georgian priests are fine looking, and the archbishop, or\r\npatriarch, who presides at Tiflis is as handsome and venerable an\r\necclesiastic as can be imagined. Some of the priests make themselves\r\nup to look like the Saviour, wearing their hair long and their beards\r\ntrimmed as He is represented to look in the pictures. They are said\r\nto be rather illiterate, however. No educational qualifications are\r\nrequired for ordination. It is a popular saying that only lazy men go\r\ninto the priesthood, but I do not think that all of them are lazy. I\r\nhave seen many who look like men of energy and brains and devotion.\r\n\r\nAlmost every store has three or four signs in different\r\nlanguages--Russian, Armenian, Georgian, Persian, Tartar, and German\r\nalso over in “the Colony,” which makes the sign boards look very odd.\r\nArmenian and Georgian lettering is different from Russian, but each is\r\nquite similar to the other.\r\n\r\nThe shops are unattractive. There are one or two large department\r\nstores filled with modern goods, but in the bazaars and native shops\r\nthere is little worth buying. The native goods are rudely made,\r\nalthough sometimes of artistic design. Rug shops are innumerable and\r\nsome of them in the Persian quarter have a large variety of stock, but\r\nthe quality is inferior and prices are high. Friends explained that\r\nwe must be patient and wait for the dealers to come down; because a\r\nPersian, like all Orientals, never expects the buyer to pay his first\r\nprice; but life is too short to haggle over such bargains, particularly\r\nas we can get better goods of the same kind in the shops of Chicago and\r\nWashington at prices quite as low as are charged here. I doubt if there\r\nis a single thing in Tiflis that any American would want which cannot\r\nbe purchased to equal advantage at home. But, as I have said, there is\r\nvery little that any American would want. The merchants select their\r\nstock to suit the tastes of their local customers, as everywhere. At a\r\ncurio shop we picked up some curious old pieces of silver, but they are\r\nvaluable only because they are unique.\r\n\r\nThere are many fine buildings in Tiflis and several handsome\r\nresidences. Some of the Armenian merchants are said to be very rich and\r\nthey live in costly houses, which are said to be handsomely furnished,\r\nbut the Russian officials have the most attractive homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMOUNT ARARAT AND THE OLDEST TOWN IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can go to the foot of Mount Ararat by railway nowadays, and\r\nalthough you cannot see the ark, you will be able to meet many\r\nvenerable Armenians who will remind you of Noah, for they look exactly\r\nas that old mariner must have looked. And you can visit what is\r\nclaimed to be the oldest town in the world, the Armenian village of\r\nNakhikheban--an Armenian word which means “he descended first”--which,\r\naccording to local tradition, was founded by Noah when he landed after\r\nhis memorable experience with the flood and doves. This railroad is due\r\nto the military enterprise of the Russian government. It is intended\r\nfor strategic purposes, in anticipation of another war with Turkey, and\r\nmust not be attributed to any benevolent disposition toward tourists.\r\nAs a matter of fact the Russian government does not encourage tourists,\r\nand every stranger who comes within range is an object of espionage so\r\nlong as he remains, which is often disagreeable.\r\n\r\nIf you will take your map of Turkey in Asia and the Caucasus you can\r\nsee for yourself where Ararat is situated, just across the boundary\r\nof Turkish Armenia and very near the corner where the territories\r\nof Russia, Turkey, and Persia meet. North and east of Ararat is the\r\nRussian province of Georgia with the river Aidaraaras, which is\r\nthe Araxes of the Bible, separating it from the Persian province of\r\nAzerbaijan. The famous river flows into the Caspian Sea about sixty\r\nmiles south of Baku, the centre of the Russian petroleum interest.\r\nSouth of Armenia is Kurdistan, a Turkish province, whose inhabitants,\r\nnomadic and half civilized, claim to be descended from the concubines\r\nof Solomon. Beyond Ararat, to the southeast, is the city of Bayazid,\r\nand still further is Lake Van, a very interesting body of water, with\r\ntwo cities called Van and Bitlis upon its banks, both of which are\r\nimportant commercial centres of Armenia. Lake Van is 5,907 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea and is one of the sources of the famous Tigris\r\nRiver. Another source of the Tigris is Lake Urmi, in Persia, which is\r\n4,100 feet above the sea, and near it is Tabriz, the most important\r\ncity in northern Persia.\r\n\r\nSouth of Kurdistan is the Turkish province of Mesopotamia, lying\r\nbetween the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which was once the centre of\r\nthe world and as important to mankind as London or New York is to-day.\r\nSomewhere there the Garden of Eden is supposed to have been located,\r\nalthough it is very far away from anything like a paradise now. It\r\nis a sandy waste, producing very little vegetation, supporting a few\r\ngoats, sheep, and camels and practically uninhabited except by roving\r\ntribes of half-savage Kurds. It is confidently believed, however, that\r\nMesopotamia can be reclaimed, and Sir William Willcocks, an English\r\nengineer, who built the Assouan dam in Egypt, has laid before the new\r\nTurkish government a plan for the irrigation of that historic province.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount Ararat]\r\n\r\nThe railway to Mount Ararat begins at Tiflis and creeps around\r\nthrough the mountains for a distance of 278 miles, climbing as high\r\nas 4,200 feet and making the journey in seventeen hours, which seems\r\ntoo long for the distance, but trains go very slowly and stop a long\r\ntime at every station. The first-class cars are luxurious. They are\r\ndivided into compartments for the accommodation of two and four people,\r\nwith the seats running from side to side, and are arranged so that the\r\nback, which is upholstered, can be lifted to a horizontal position like\r\nan upper berth in one of our Pullman cars. Thus a day coach may be\r\ntransformed into a sleeper without extra charge, although passengers,\r\nif they would be comfortable, must carry their own sheets, pillows,\r\nblankets, and towels and make up their own beds. Therefore practically\r\nevery traveller carries a roll of bedding with him, as is done in\r\nIndia, although the Russian cars are infinitely more comfortable in\r\nevery respect. The second-class passengers all over Russia are taken\r\ncare of much better than the first-class on the India railways.\r\nTheir accommodations are almost as good as those in the first-class\r\ncarriages. The only reason for taking the latter is to avoid the crowd\r\nand be a little more exclusive. No seats or compartments are reserved,\r\nhence there is a rush for the vacant places whenever the train stops\r\nat a station, and if you happen to get into one of the four-berth\r\ncompartments you cannot choose your company. But these petty annoyances\r\nare forgotten a few hours after the journey is over.\r\n\r\nThe scenery along the line is sublime. Every now and then you can catch\r\na glimpse of a snow-clad peak with noble outlines. The mountain sides\r\nare covered with forests, notwithstanding the fact that this is the\r\noldest part of the world, and you can scarcely realize that some of\r\nthe towns at which the train stops have been standing since the flood.\r\nMost of the people at the stations are farmers, who make a good living\r\ncultivating the soil and raising sheep and goats, and the women of\r\ntheir households work up the wool with old-fashioned looms into rugs\r\nand felt.\r\n\r\nSince the Romanoffs brought their expansion policy down that way so\r\nfar as to include a part of the ancient kingdom of Armenia, they\r\nhave rebuilt the Turkish town of Gumri and have re-christened it\r\nAlexandropol in honour of one of their emperors. It is a purely modern\r\nmilitary station at a strategic point, with barracks for four thousand\r\ntroops, arsenals, armouries, large warehouses filled with military\r\nsupplies, and everything necessary to equip an army at short notice.\r\nSuch posts have been located all along the southern borders of the\r\nRussian empire overlooking Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, India, China,\r\nand other Asiatic neighbours.\r\n\r\nAll Russian towns are built on the same model, with wide, well-shaded\r\nstreets, substantial residences, good shops, electric lights, and,\r\nif the patronage will justify it, a line of street cars. There is\r\nalways an imposing church, under the care of a group of priests who\r\nare doing secular missionary work laid out for them by the holy synod\r\nat St. Petersburg--Russofying the natives, if that word may be used;\r\nconducting a political rather than an evangelical propaganda. Their\r\npolicy is never to interfere with the religions or the customs of the\r\npeople they conquer, but to assimilate them quietly and gradually by\r\neducating the children in Russian schools, teaching them the language\r\nfirst and then lessons in patriotism and loyalty.\r\n\r\nThe population of Alexandropol was almost exclusively Armenian until\r\nthe Russians came. Now it is about half and half. The Armenians have\r\na handsome church, dedicated to St. Gregory “the Enlightener”; they\r\nkeep the shops and do the mechanical work and are infinitely better off\r\nsince Russian occupation than they ever were before. Russian Armenia\r\nis peaceful and prosperous and in a degree progressive--much more so\r\nthan any other section of the ancient Armenian kingdom at any period of\r\nits history. The construction of the railway has given the farmers an\r\noutlet for their produce; the large expenditures for maintaining troops\r\nhave brought much money into communities that scarcely ever knew what\r\nmoney was during Turkish domination, and have provided a permanent and\r\nprofitable market for everything the people produce. The construction\r\nof barracks, fortifications, roads, and other such public works has\r\nfurnished employment for thousands and has provided a permanent and\r\nsteady income for the labouring classes.\r\n\r\nAlexandropol is 4,850 feet above the sea and almost surrounded by\r\nsnow-covered peaks. The highest is Alaghez, 15,000 feet; and Ararat,\r\n17,260 feet high, may often be seen in the distance.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of Alaghez is a wonderful lake called Goktcha,\r\noccupying the crater of a volcano 6,337 feet above the sea. The lake\r\nis forty-three miles long and an average of twenty miles wide and\r\nreceives the drainage of a very large area. The mountains that encircle\r\nit rise like a wall between 4,000 and 5,000 feet and most of them are\r\nentirely covered with timber. The water is very deep, clear, and cold,\r\nand abounds with fish, which furnish employment for many people. They\r\nship their catch daily by train to Tiflis, which is a limited but a\r\nprofitable market. The choicest fish is a salmon trout similar to that\r\nfound in the streams and lakes of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, if we are to believe the legends, the fish in Lake\r\nGoktcha were never seen between Christmas Day and Lent, but on Ash\r\nWednesday used to come to the surface in large schools and permit\r\nthemselves to be caught daily until Easter Sunday. This practice, as\r\nI understand, has become obsolete, and they behave like other fish in\r\nthese degenerate days.\r\n\r\nOn an island in the lake is a picturesque Armenian monastery called\r\nafter St. Sevan, alleged to have been founded by Tiridates, the most\r\nfamous of all the kings of Armenia, only three hundred years after the\r\ncrucifixion.\r\n\r\nBelow Alexandropol, a branch of the railway runs up to the city of\r\nKars, another point of great strategic importance in case Russia and\r\nTurkey should ever come to blows again, as they have so many times in\r\nthe past, for it commands all northern Armenia. The Russians intend\r\nto annex the rest of Armenia to their dominions sooner or later, and\r\nthen they will have Persia practically surrounded. This is the second\r\ntime they have occupied Kars. They captured it during the Crimean war,\r\nbut were compelled to give it up. In 1877 they took it again, and the\r\nfollowing year it was definitely assigned to them by the Powers of\r\nEurope in the treaty of Berlin. The improvements since that time have\r\nbeen purely military, like everything else that Russia does down there.\r\nThe old town remains just as it was in Turkish times, and the new town\r\nis like Alexandropol and other places I have described.\r\n\r\nNot far south of Alexandropol, the railway passes through the\r\nextensive ruins of Ani, from the beginning of things down to the\r\neleventh century the capital of the Armenians. In 1046 the king\r\nrelinquished his authority in favour of the Byzantine emperor at\r\nConstantinople, and from that date up to 1877 that territory has been\r\na part of Turkey. There are evidences of considerable splendour. The\r\nwalls which surrounded the city are only partly destroyed, and a\r\nconsiderable section still remains forty and fifty feet high, with\r\nnumerous round towers and battlements built of yellow stone and\r\nembellished with courses and crosses and other ornaments in black\r\nbasalt. The gateways were imposing. The churches must have been large.\r\nThe walls of several remain and portions of beautifully arched roofs.\r\nHere and there are decorations of rich carving, mosaic, and tiles,\r\nwhich, however, are rapidly peeling away and crumbling from neglect.\r\nUpon the edge of a ravine are the ruins of an extensive building with\r\na monumental gateway which is supposed to have been the palace of the\r\nking, although there is no description of such a building in Armenian\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Russian Armenia is thoroughly Russian in spots, but the\r\ngreater part of it is thoroughly Oriental, and the bazaars, where most\r\nof the trade is conducted, are as interesting as any in the East. The\r\nname of the town is pronounced “Yer-ri-van,” with the accent on the\r\nlast syllable, and the word means “at the foot,” referring of course\r\nto Mount Ararat, the most famous of all mountains, perhaps, as well as\r\none of the most interesting. The two peaks that compose the mountain,\r\nthe greater 17,260 feet and the lesser 13,000 feet high, are always\r\nwithin view, barring the weather, and there is a decided difference of\r\nopinion as to the number of clear days in that climate. People who\r\nwant to “knock the town” insist that the peak of Great Ararat cannot be\r\nseen more than once a week, but the more loyal inhabitants will assure\r\nyou that it is in plain sight every hour, morning, noon, and night, and\r\nevery day in the year.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Erivan are wide, the houses are of one story, built very\r\nmuch after the Spanish or Moorish plan, around a patio, and without\r\nwindows on the street. There are a few good shops filled with modern\r\nmerchandise in the Russian quarter, with restaurants, cafés, and other\r\nmodern improvements. There are two hotels which are simply tolerable\r\nand no more--the kind that you would not patronize unless you had to.\r\nThe bazaars, however, are very busy, because a large population come\r\nhere for trade, and Erivan is practically the terminus of the railway,\r\nwhich brings vast quantities of freight that must be carried farther\r\non by camel caravans. These caravans meet and receive and discharge\r\ntheir cargoes at a large open square, surrounded by khans, the Oriental\r\nsubstitute for hotels, and such places are always fascinating to people\r\nfrom other parts of the world. Most of the goods that are carried\r\ninto the interior come from Moscow, for the Russian government always\r\nprotects its manufacturers and promotes their trade where it can be\r\ndone without interfering with military affairs. Most of the goods that\r\nare shipped out are rugs, wool, hides, and skins from various parts of\r\nPersia and Turkish-Armenia, which are sent in bulk by rail and boat and\r\nsteamer to Constantinople and there distributed.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to buy; nothing that any American would want. Although\r\nthe bazaars contain a complex assortment of merchandise of sufficient\r\nvariety to suit Oriental comers, they are not our kind of goods.\r\nThe bazaars are made up of little boxes not more than six or eight\r\nfeet square, lined with shelves filled with goods, and the proprietor\r\nsits in the midst of them, “squatting like a Turk,” or stretched out\r\ncomfortably upon a rug smoking cigarettes. You seldom see the narghile,\r\nor Turkish water pipe with a long tube. The bazaars cover many acres,\r\nwhich are cut up into narrow, winding streets sheltered from the sun\r\nby roofs of masonry or awnings of matting, and, as usual, the trade is\r\nclassified for the convenience of the public. The vegetable dealers,\r\nthe butchers, the candlestick makers, the hardware and iron mongers,\r\nthe leather mongers and print dealers, all have their own streets,\r\nand the shops are so close together that rival merchants can chatter\r\ntogether while waiting for customers.\r\n\r\nThere is an old fortress built by the Persians while they occupied the\r\ncountry, and an ancient palace within its walls, several of the rooms\r\nbeing handsomely decorated with tiles and fantastic designs in coloured\r\nglass. Most of the space, however, is occupied by barracks for the\r\nsoldiers, who are as numerous as they are in all other frontier Russian\r\ntowns; but at the same time they bring in a great deal of business\r\nand contribute to the prosperity of the farmers and merchants and\r\neverybody. And I do not know what the hotels would do if it were not\r\nfor the officers of the Russian army.\r\n\r\nThe population of Erivan is very much mixed, but the larger number\r\nare Armenian Christians, who control the financial and commercial\r\naffairs, as they do everywhere else in this section, and have displayed\r\nthat remarkable aptitude for commerce and accumulation that is\r\ncharacteristic of the race. There are many Turks, more Persians, and\r\nstill more Kurds, who do the teaming, drive the cabs, and load the\r\ncamels. The heavy labour is done by Kurds and Tartars, and the trading\r\nby Persians and Armenians, as it is elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are many monasteries in Armenia and all of them are very old.\r\nEtchmiadzin is undoubtedly the oldest monastic establishment in the\r\nworld, and is not only interesting for that reason, but also because it\r\nwas the cradle of the Christian faith in that region, and the residence\r\nof the much venerated St. Gregory, the Enlightener. He is so called\r\nbecause he converted King Tiridates. There are many relics of this most\r\nfamous Armenian saint. Any one who will take the trouble to drive eight\r\nor ten miles to the village of Khorvirab may see a well in which St.\r\nGregory is said to have been confined by his persecutors for fourteen\r\nyears, having his food and drink lowered down to him by a rope all this\r\ntime. In one of the chapels of the monastery is the slab of marble he\r\nused to cover a cave into which he drove all the devils that pestered\r\nArmenia in his day. A picturesque shrine now occupies the spot. But\r\nSt. Gregory does not seem to have been as successful as St. Patrick\r\nwas with the snakes in Ireland. Some of the devils must have been\r\noverlooked, because he was not only bitterly persecuted himself, but\r\nhis followers in Armenia have suffered more than the believers in any\r\nreligion in any other part of the world.\r\n\r\nThe monastery is very large and is surrounded by a massive wall which\r\nhas sustained many a siege and repelled frequent attacks by Kurds,\r\nTurks, Tartars, Persians, and Saracens. There are several buildings,\r\nthe most conspicuous containing the apartments of the patriarch and\r\nthe several archbishops, bishops, and clerks who assist him in the\r\nperformance of his duties. There is a hospice for the entertainment\r\nof visiting clergy who go there in large numbers on business and to\r\nseek inspiration; another less pretentious is for the entertainment of\r\npilgrims, and near by is a bazaar, or market, where they can purchase\r\nfood and other supplies. A theological seminary with forty or fifty\r\nstudents who are studying for the Armenian ministry is maintained also,\r\nand the privilege of attending it is quite as highly prized as that\r\nenjoyed by the students of the famous Roman Catholic colleges at Rome.\r\nAs a rule, the Armenian clergy are not highly educated. The reason\r\nis that their parishioners are not able to pay for the services of\r\neducated men; but many brilliant young theologians have gone out from\r\nthat school to Armenian colonies in different parts of the world to\r\ndefend the faith with zeal and eloquence.\r\n\r\nThe library of the institution, however, does not convey an impression\r\nof scholarship. The number of books upon its shelves is very small,\r\nthey are all very old, and most of them are obsolete. There does not\r\nappear to be a demand for a supply of literature, theological or\r\notherwise, in the Armenian language. Very few of the books are of any\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThere has been a delusion among Oriental scholars that the library at\r\nEtchmiadzin is filled with ancient manuscripts of great interest and\r\nvalue, but that is not the case. There are no attractions there for\r\nstudents, and the Armenian clergy seem to take much deeper interest\r\nin certain superstitions and the traditions attached to the highly\r\nvenerated relics in their sanctuary than in the contents of their book\r\nshelves.\r\n\r\nThe treasury of the monastery contains a third “holy lance”--the\r\nweapon of the soldier which pierced the side of the Saviour as He hung\r\nupon the cross. There is a duplicate at the palace of the emperor\r\nof Austria, which was brought from Jerusalem by St. Helena and once\r\nbelonged to Constantine the Great, then to Charlemagne, by whom it was\r\npassed down to his successors as the head of the Holy Roman Empire.\r\nThere is still another in St. Peter’s at Rome, which was brought from\r\nthe Holy Land by the Crusaders, who discovered it through a miracle at\r\nAntioch. The “holy lance” here is said to have been brought to Armenia\r\nby Thaddeus, the disciple, when he came at the invitation of the king\r\nto convert the nation.\r\n\r\nA still more interesting relic is a fragment of Noah’s ark--a ragged\r\nand rotten piece of a plank, about four feet long, eighteen inches\r\nwide, and two inches thick, which is alleged to have been taken from\r\nthe hull of that venerated vessel. There are no written guarantees, and\r\ntherefore it is impossible to establish identity, but as it is equally\r\nimpossible to disprove the statement, it is easier to accept the faith\r\nof those good people without question.\r\n\r\nWhat is probably more genuine is a beautifully chased silver reliquary\r\nin the shape of a forearm and hand, which is said to contain the actual\r\nright hand and arm of St. Gregory, and it is used in an impressive\r\nceremony at the consecration of the patriarch of the Armenian church.\r\nAt the benediction this silver reliquary containing the hand of the\r\nfounder of the Armenian church is solemnly placed upon the forehead of\r\nthe candidate by the officiating bishop.\r\n\r\nThere are many other relics of saints and martyrs of the Armenian faith\r\nwhose names and history are unknown to us. Indeed, one has to go there\r\nto realize how little the people of the United States know about one of\r\nthe greatest branches of the Christian church.\r\n\r\nThe monastery proper is an ancient building with cells for thirty-four\r\nmonks, who spend most of their time looking after the business\r\nmanagement of the institution and, as you can well understand, are\r\nproud of their vocation and highly prize the privileges they enjoy.\r\nThey are assisted in the cultivation of a farm and in caring for large\r\nflocks of sheep and goats by a village of peasants, who increase the\r\ndependents of the institution to several thousand persons.\r\n\r\nThe architectural attractions are not great--the buildings are not\r\nimposing and the chapel, a portion of which dates back to the fourth\r\nand the rest to the seventh century, is a small, dark, cruciform\r\nbuilding without beauty of design or decoration. Still it is\r\ninteresting because it is undoubtedly one of the oldest houses of\r\nworship in all the world. There are two patriarchal thrones, one on\r\neach side of the apse. That on the left is occupied on occasions of\r\nceremony by the patriarch. That on the right is reserved for the use of\r\nthe Saviour in case the second advent should occur without warning.\r\n\r\nThere are no portraits or paintings of interest, but one is struck\r\nby the simple, primitive, earnest dignity of the place, and the\r\nunostentatious manner in which the inmates live and conduct their\r\naffairs. All of them take their meals in one of two refectories, both\r\nlow, long rooms, with a single narrow table running down the centre\r\nbetween rude benches. At the end of the larger refectory is a throne\r\nunder a canopy which the patriarch may occupy if he pleases, although\r\nhe usually dines alone, and at the other end is a pulpit from which\r\nsomebody always reads aloud from the Bible or from some volume of\r\nreligious literature while the meals are being served. The same\r\npractice is followed in many Roman Catholic monasteries and seminaries\r\nand is intended to keep the minds of the listeners upon serious things\r\nand make their meals as solemn as possible. There is no disposition to\r\nremain at the table longer than is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the refectories assigned to the clergy and the students is\r\nalways open to visitors, and lodgings are afforded to all comers in the\r\nold monastic style, with a cordial welcome, without money and without\r\nprice, although a guest is expected to drop a contribution in a poor\r\nbox, which is conveniently placed for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIf that entertaining old story teller, called Tradition, can be relied\r\nupon, Nakhikheban, Armenia, is the oldest town in existence; the\r\nfirst human settlement founded after the deluge--and there began the\r\nrenaissance by Noah of a world that had been washed clean of sin and\r\niniquity after a thorough soaking of forty days. Nakhikheban is where\r\nNoah and his family settled when they came out of the ark, and he made\r\nhis home here, according to the legends, until his death. We do not\r\nknow exactly where he lived before the deluge or where the ark was\r\nbuilt, but at any rate he did not go back there, and from this place\r\nthe family scattered to obey the divine command to replenish the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nakhikheban, founded by Noah on the slope of Ararat. The\r\noldest town in the world]\r\n\r\nThere are various ways of spelling the name of the town, which is the\r\ncase with nearly all the towns in that part of the world. The Russians\r\nhave it Nakhitchevan, but the map makers generally accept the Armenian\r\nversion, for it is an Armenian word, and it means “he descended\r\nhere”--referring, of course, to the landing from the ark. It is\r\nworth the trip from Erivan, and even from Tiflis, if only to say that\r\nyou have been there. It is a distinction to have visited the oldest\r\ncommunity on the entire globe, and Noah would feel very much set up if\r\nhe could know that people came all the way from America to accord his\r\ntown such an honour. Unfortunately, there are no records back of the\r\npretensions of the sleepy little place; there is no history of those\r\neventful days; the oldest inhabitants are dead; and the only foundation\r\nfor the tradition is a few vague words in the Bible.\r\n\r\nNoah is buried near Damascus, where his grave is forty-five feet long,\r\nand the people there will tell you that he was a very tall man. His\r\nwife is buried at the village of Marand, at the base of Ararat, where\r\nshe died a few years after the landing. The poor woman was not allowed\r\nto live to see the glory of her descendants. The local traditions also\r\nplace the Garden of Eden in that vicinity, in the valley of the Araxes,\r\nat the base of Ararat, through which runs the great highway from Erivan\r\ninto Persia, which has been travelled for six thousand years in peace\r\nand in war, and has been the channel of commerce since human beings\r\nbegan to trade with one another. It has also been the scene of untold\r\nslaughter and misery, and forty battles have been fought to control\r\nit. This road has been trodden by the mighty hosts of Cyrus, Darius,\r\nXerxes, and Alexander the Great, and Hannibal led his legions along\r\nthis way to conquer the Caucasus. The Russians control that highway now\r\nand they bought it by the sacrifice of many lives.\r\n\r\nAll that remains of a memorable epoch in the world’s history, in which\r\nNoah was the leading actor, is Mt. Ararat itself, and many wise men\r\nare of the opinion that there has been a universal misapprehension\r\nconcerning that. The Right Honourable James Bryce, British Ambassador\r\nto Washington, who wrote a book about that country thirty-five years\r\nago, may be accepted as the most reliable authority, and with his\r\npermission I may quote him on this subject. He says:\r\n\r\n“The only topographical reference in the Scripture narrative of the\r\nflood is to be found in the words, Genesis viii, 4--‘In the seventh\r\nmonth, on the 17th day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains\r\nof Ararat,’ which may be taken as equivalent to ‘on a mountain of (or\r\nin) Ararat.’\r\n\r\n“The word Ararat is used in three, or rather in two, other places in\r\nthe Scriptures. One is in II Kings xix, 38, where it is said of the\r\nsons of Sennacherib, who had just murdered their father, that they\r\nescaped into the land of Ararat, rendered in our version, and in the\r\nSeptuagint, ‘Armenia.’ The other is in Jeremiah li., 27 ‘Call together:\r\nagainst her (i. e., Babylon) the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and\r\nAschenaz.’ The question then is what does this Ararat denote? Clearly,\r\nthe Alexandrian translators took it for Armenia; so does the Vulgate\r\nwhen it renders in Genesis viii, 4, the words which we translate On\r\nthe mountains of Ararat’ by ‘super montes Armeniæ.’ This narrows it\r\na little, and St. Jerome himself helps us to narrow it still further\r\nwhen, in his commentary on Isaiah xxxvii, 38, he says that ‘Ararat\r\nmeans the plain of the middle Araxes, which lies at the foot of the\r\ngreat mountain Taurus.’\r\n\r\n“The identification, therefore, is natural enough; what is of more\r\nconsequence is to determine how early it took place; for as there is\r\nlittle or no trace of an independent local tradition of the flood,\r\nwe may assume the identification to rest entirely on the use of the\r\nname Ararat in the Hebrew narrative. Josephus (Ant. Jud., bk i, ch.\r\niii) says that the Armenians called the place where Noah descended\r\nthe ‘disembarking place, for the ark being saved in that place, its\r\nremains are shown there by the inhabitants to this day’ and also quotes\r\nNicolas of Damascus, who writes that: ‘In Armenia, above Minyas, there\r\nis a great mountain called Baras, upon which it is said that many who\r\nescaped at the time of the flood were saved, and that one who was\r\ncarried in an ark came ashore on top of it, and that the remains of the\r\nwood were preserved for a long while. This might be the man about whom\r\nMoses, the law-giver of the Jews, wrote.’\r\n\r\n“Marco Polo, whose route does not seem to have led him near it, says\r\nonly, in speaking of Armenia: ‘Here is an exceeding great mountain,\r\non which, it is said, the ark of Noah rested, and for this cause it\r\nis called the Mountain of the Ark of Noah. The circuit of its base\r\ncannot be traversed in less than two days; and the ascent is rendered\r\nimpossible by the snow on its summit, which never dissolves, but is\r\nincreased by each successive fall. On the lower declivities the melted\r\nsnows cause an abundant vegetation, and afford rich pastures for\r\nthe cattle which in summer resort thither from all the surrounding\r\ncountries.’”\r\n\r\nFor centuries it was conceded that the top of Ararat could not be\r\nreached, and even to-day the highest Armenian ecclesiastics insist\r\nthat God has made it impossible for human feet to climb it. They\r\ninsist that no one has ever reached the top and that no one ever\r\nwill, but the ascent has been made by at least fourteen or fifteen\r\nexperienced mountaineers. Mr. Bryce himself not only made the quickest\r\nascent on record in 1877, but went up entirely alone. The Russian\r\ngovernor-general at Erivan furnished him with a body-guard of Cossacks\r\nand several Kurd porters, who, when they reached a height of twelve\r\nthousand feet, refused to go any farther, and, at one o’clock in the\r\nmorning, Mr. Bryce started on alone, reaching the summit, about two the\r\nfollowing afternoon, and returning to camp the same night.\r\n\r\nIt had been his ambition from childhood to ascend Ararat, which was\r\ndue to Scriptural associations and to reading when a boy a thrilling\r\naccount of an ascent by Doctor Parrot, the first human being, so far as\r\nknown, to reach the summit.\r\n\r\nThere are two peaks, called Greater and Lesser Ararat, about seven\r\nmiles apart. Greater Ararat rises to a height of 17,323 feet from\r\nthe plain of the Araxes, being the second mountain in height west of\r\nthe Himalayas, Elburz, in the Caucasus, alone exceeding it, with a\r\nheight of 18,493 feet. Lesser Ararat rises 13,300 feet, and is almost\r\nidentical in shape with its greater companion. Both are slumbering\r\nvolcanoes, and although there has been no eruption within the memory\r\nof men, earthquakes have frequently occurred and have caused much\r\ndamage. The line of perpetual snow is thirteen thousand feet, and the\r\nsummit of the Greater Ararat is always covered, an almost perfect dome\r\nof spotless white rising against an azure sky. It is one of the most\r\nbeautiful of mountains. At an elevation of about 5,600 feet on the\r\nslopes of Greater Ararat formerly stood an Armenian village called\r\nArghuri, an Armenian name meaning “he planted the vine.” According to\r\ntradition an Armenian church dating from the eighth century occupied\r\nthe spot where Noah built his altar and offered his first sacrifice\r\nafter leaving the ark and making a safe descent of the mountain with\r\nhis family and the living creatures that were saved with him. At\r\nArghuri “he planted the vine” and raised grapes, made wine, drank to\r\nexcess, and got caught in the scrape narrated in Genesis ix, 20. Until\r\n1840, when the village was destroyed by an earthquake, the actual vine\r\nreferred to, planted by the hands of the patriarch, was still pointed\r\nout by the people.\r\n\r\nThe Persian rulers of this country used to have a summer residence near\r\nthe village, but it was destroyed with the rest and has never been\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nNear the site of Arghuri, the monastery of St. Jacob marked the spot\r\nwhere a saintly monk of that name, a contemporary of St. Gregory,\r\nfounder of the Armenian church, received divine evidence that the\r\ntraditions connecting Noah and the ark with Ararat are true. For years\r\nhe lived a hermit upon the mountain side praying for light. At length\r\nGod sent an angel, who appeared to him in his sleep and deposited upon\r\nhis breast a fragment of the ark as a reward for his faith and zeal and\r\npiety. That is the fragment of a plank which may now be seen in the\r\ntreasury of the monastery at Etchmiadzin.\r\n\r\nVan is an ancient city, appearing in early Persian and Assyrian\r\nannals. Above the city on the face of a cliff are inscriptions said\r\nto have been written by Darius the Great when he was at the height of\r\nhis power. From Castle Rock, on a clear day, Mount Ararat with its\r\nperpetually snow-capped peak can be seen. Eastward from Van, less than\r\na three days’ journey, are the borders of Persia, and on the south lie\r\nthe mountains occupied by the Nestorians and the Kurds. Even up to the\r\npresent time, these southern regions are not brought wholly under\r\ngovernmental control, although order is gradually being established.\r\n\r\nThe city is upon a high plateau six thousand feet above the sea and on\r\nthe border of a great salt lake. Around this lake many a bloody war\r\nhas been waged, during a period of from three to four thousand years.\r\nHistory shows that from 1000 to 600 B.C. Van was the capital of a\r\nstrong kingdom. Its kings often went forth with armies to battle and\r\nfrequently left records upon the rocks recounting their victories. Such\r\ninscriptions are found as far west as Harpoot where a record is made\r\nthat in 700 B.C., the king of Van waged war against the Hittite king of\r\nValetia. There are two records of conflict between these two rulers,\r\nand it is a significant fact that in both instances the king of Van did\r\nnot halt to write the inscription telling of his great success until\r\nafter he had put a considerable distance between himself and the enemy\r\nwhom he claims to have vanquished.\r\n\r\nVan was the capital of Armenia for centuries, and even to-day is\r\nregarded by many Armenians as their capital city. The Armenians,\r\nin large numbers there, are unusually strong intellectually and\r\ncommercially. They outnumber the Turks and control trade. Van has been\r\na centre and hotbed of Armenian revolutionists for many years, which\r\nhas been the cause of no little anxiety to the Turkish officials. Being\r\nso near the Russian border on the north and the Persian border on the\r\neast, it has been possible for the revolutionists to escape punishment\r\nby fleeing across the line. The Turks complain that Russia and Persia\r\nhave allowed their territory to be made places of refuge for outlaws\r\nsought by Turkey.\r\n\r\nVan is one of the latest mission stations opened by the American\r\nBoard in Turkey. It was not occupied until 1872. This district, being\r\nthe headquarters of one of the divisions of the Armenian church (the\r\nmonastery in which the Vartebad resides is located upon an island in\r\nthe lake of Van), mission work made progress very slowly at first.\r\nThe people were suspicious of the strangers who had come. One of the\r\nfirst missionaries sent in was a physician, Dr. G. C. Raynolds, of\r\nLong-meadow, Mass., and it was largely through his influence that the\r\nearly prejudice was overcome. Within the last ten years the medical\r\nwork has made rapid advance until there is now a well established and\r\nequipped American hospital with an American trained nurse. Something\r\nlike ten or twelve thousand patients are treated every year, including\r\nKurds, Turks, and Armenians of all classes and all grades of society.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Armenian massacres in 1895, seven or eight thousand\r\nrefugees were admitted into the mission compound and were there fed for\r\nseveral days until the excitement had passed. There was a feeling among\r\nthe Armenians that safety could only be found in the American premises.\r\nFollowing the universal custom of our missionaries in such cases, arms\r\nwere not allowed to be brought in, and only those who were willing to\r\ngive up their guns at the gate were admitted. Because of this attitude\r\nthe government was ready, when asked, to send soldiers to guard the\r\npremises, so that no one who reached the missionary grounds was injured.\r\n\r\nThere was such destitution after the massacres, owing to the death\r\nof so many of the wage earners and the loss of crops, that it became\r\nnecessary to make the Van mission a relief and supply station for\r\nthat entire section. Money was sent from Europe and America in large\r\namounts. Seed was bought for the farmer that he might sow his ground\r\nwhen the time for sowing came. As most of the cattle had been driven\r\noff, oxen were brought from remote districts and loaned to the farmers\r\nthat they might plough their land; and many agricultural implements\r\nwere bought for them. In the city, bakeries were started and a variety\r\nof industries organized, so that for a year or two the mission became\r\na hive of industry, giving more time and strength to ministering to\r\nthe physical needs of the people than to preaching and teaching, to\r\ndemonstrate to the people the fundamental principles of Christianity.\r\n\r\nEducational work has made rapid advances. The prejudices of the people\r\nagainst the Americans have been largely broken down, and for the last\r\nfew years the mission schools have been crowded beyond their capacity.\r\nAt the present writing (1910), the American schools in Van alone have\r\nover one thousand pupils in attendance. The High School for Boys, which\r\nhas been unusually prosperous, has reached a point where the people\r\nare urging that it be erected into a college. A tract of land has\r\nrecently been purchased which is suitable to meet the needs of such a\r\ncollege for at least a quarter of a century. Some funds have already\r\nbeen subscribed for this purpose, and it is expected that, in the near\r\nfuture, there will be an American college in Van to supply the demand\r\nfor higher education among the large population occupying the eastern\r\npart of the Turkish Empire. Such a college will undoubtedly attract\r\nmany students from Russia as well as from Persia. There can be little\r\ndoubt as to its success, or as to the widespread influence that such an\r\ninstitution would exert. Graduates of the high school now in America\r\nare taking courses of study with a view to returning to their country\r\nto take part in its establishment, and undoubtedly many Armenians of\r\nwealth will contribute liberally toward the buildings and endowment.\r\n\r\nDoctor Raynolds, already referred to, who began mission work in 1872,\r\nhas faced many trying circumstances. At times the revolutionists have\r\nbeen so hostile to him that they have threatened his life. On the other\r\nhand, he has been accused by the Turkish government of connection\r\nwith the revolutionists, and has often been kept under surveillance\r\nby them. Nevertheless, through all emergencies, the doctor has held\r\nsteadily to an attitude of strict neutrality. A few years ago, the\r\nrevolutionists, having secured arms from outside, barricaded a part of\r\nthe city and defied the Turkish governor and his army. The governor\r\nmade preparations to attack. It was well known to Doctor Raynolds and\r\nother missionaries, that, if the attack began, hundreds of lives would\r\nbe sacrificed, the innocent with the guilty, and the spirit of murder\r\nand looting would be let loose. The missionary went to the governor\r\nand asked him to delay the attack until he could go in person to the\r\nrevolutionists to see if something could not be done to heal the open\r\nbreach between them and the government. The governor seemed to feel\r\nthat it was useless; that nothing remained for him but to crush the\r\nspirit of revolution out of the Armenians of the city, which in itself\r\nmeant a general massacre. At Doctor Raynolds’s solicitation, however,\r\nan armistice was declared, and at midnight, without an attendant and\r\nunarmed, he went into the camp of the revolutionists. Their guards\r\nseized him as soon as he approached. He was taken before the leaders\r\nand urged them, for the sake of the innocent people who would suffer\r\nmost severely in case an attack was made, to come to some agreement\r\nwith the governor, or else withdraw from the city.\r\n\r\nHe returned from the revolutionists to the governor, and from the\r\ngovernor went back to the revolutionists, until finally an agreement\r\nwas reached. The leaders of the insurrection were allowed to escape\r\nfrom the country unmolested; and order was restored without the\r\nloss of a single life. This is only one of many instances in which\r\nthis missionary doctor has been instrumental in preventing a bloody\r\ncollision between conflicting forces. While critical persons might say\r\nthat this is not one of the duties of a missionary yet no one would\r\nsuggest that it was not worthy of an advocate of the Gospel of Peace.\r\n\r\nIf one starts from Constantinople and travels eastward across Asia\r\nMinor, Armenia, and Kurdistan, and keeps on in that direction until he\r\narrives at the foot of snow-capped Ararat; if he then turns northward\r\nto the Black Sea coast and from there strikes south over the Taurus\r\nand the Anti-Taurus Mountains, crossing the great populous plains of\r\nthe upper waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, the Araxes and the Halys\r\nRivers, holding still to the south across northern Mesopotamia into\r\nSyria--in traversing all that vast region he will find almost nothing\r\nof modern medicine or surgery or hospital facilities except those which\r\nbelong to the American missionary or have sprung from his work.\r\n\r\nIn great centres of trade and population like Cæsarea, Marsovan,\r\nSivas, Harpoot, Erzeroom, Van, Diarbekir, Mardin, and Aintab, one will\r\nfind medical missionaries of the American Board carrying on the most\r\nbenevolent and soul-winning lines of work God gives His children to\r\nperform on earth. With them are associated an increasing company of\r\nnative doctors. Some of them were trained by the missionaries alone,\r\nwhile not a few have received their professional preparation either in\r\nthe medical school at the Syrian Protestant Medical College at Beirut,\r\nor in some foreign country.\r\n\r\nWere it possible to separate and set aside by themselves all the\r\ncivilizing forces, all the facilities for betterment in society, that\r\nhave entered Turkey through missionary agencies, it would surprise\r\nthe commercial world. The sum total of American textile manufactures,\r\nAmerican sewing machines, ploughs, and other farming implements,\r\ncabinet organs, bells, books, cabinet-makers’ tools, drugs and\r\nmedicines, and numberless other commodities they have brought in would\r\nfoot up to an astonishing figure. And this is but the beginning. There\r\nare movements of great significance on foot, resulting from the same\r\ninfluence, and likely to develop into a greater expansion of American\r\ncommerce in that country.\r\n\r\nThe other part, the all-pervasive influence of their work, the change\r\nin ideas and ideals, the enlightenment of the people of all grades\r\nand classes, the change in the condition of women, the betterment of\r\nthe family, the fading out of superstitious notions, the widespread\r\nlonging for reform in matters social and secular, and for advancement\r\nin civilization--all these are results of the greatest moment, which\r\ncannot be shown in figures, for they are greater than figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE ARMENIANS AND THEIR PERSECUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nArmenia is perhaps the oldest of all the Christian countries in the\r\nworld. It was a powerful nation at the advent of Christ, although at\r\ndifferent periods in its history it was occupied by the Persians under\r\nCyrus, the Macedonians under Alexander the Great, and the Romans under\r\nthe Cæsars. One of the kings of Armenia, Tigranes II, made a treaty\r\nwith Pompey under which he submitted to a protectorate from Rome, but\r\nafter his death his son and successor, Artavasdes III, rebelled, was\r\nseverely chastised by Marc Antony, and taken prisoner to Alexandria,\r\nwhere he was beheaded in the year 30 B.C. by order of Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nThere is a legend that one of the immediate successors of Tigranes,\r\nhaving heard of the teachings of Jesus and His persecution by the Jews,\r\nsent Him a letter by a distinguished envoy offering Him the hospitality\r\nof Armenia and the widest freedom in carrying on His work. Jesus, the\r\ntradition continues, replied that His duty lay among His own people,\r\nbut sent a representative in the person of His disciple, Thaddeus,\r\nwho was warmly received and preached the new Gospel throughout the\r\nkingdom until the entire population accepted the Christian faith. Some\r\nclever fabricator several years ago pretended to discover the original\r\nmanuscript of this correspondence among the archives of one of the\r\nancient Armenian monasteries, and the announcement created a decided\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance to the monastery of Etchmiadzin, Armenia]\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret that this legend cannot be sustained, but it\r\nis an actual fact that Tiridates, king of Armenia, was converted to\r\nChristianity in the year 259 A.D. by St. Gregory, “the Enlightener,”\r\nand was therefore the first sovereign in the world to accept the new\r\nfaith and to adopt it as the religion of his nation. The Emperor\r\nConstantine did not accept Christianity until thirty years or more\r\nafterward. Armenia is therefore the oldest of Christian countries, and\r\nthe monastery of Etchmiadzin, twelve miles from Erivan, is still, as it\r\nhas been from the third century, the ecclesiastical headquarters of the\r\nArmenian church. The word in English means “the only begotten.”\r\n\r\nBut the Armenians have had a stormy time in defence of their religion\r\never since. Theological controversies began early among them, and\r\npersecution has been relentless. The Armenian clergy refused to accept\r\nthe decree of the council of Chalcedon, and in 491 A.D. seceded from\r\nthe Church of Rome. Later they separated from the orthodox Greeks, and\r\nalthough frequent attempts have been made to bring about a reunion\r\nwith the Church of Russia, which is a branch of the Greek Church, the\r\nArmenians have remained an independent ecclesiastical body, with a pope\r\nor patriarch called a _katholikos_ as its administrative head, with the\r\nmonastery of Etchmiadzin as his metropolis. He is elected for life by\r\ndelegates from the various Armenian communities throughout the world,\r\nwho come there for that purpose when a vacancy occurs, and he is the\r\nspiritual head of believers in the Armenian creed in America, Europe,\r\nAsia, and Africa. The authority of the Armenian _katholikos_ does not\r\nextend to theological questions. The creed of that faith cannot be\r\naltered except by a vote of the house of bishops, and he does not claim\r\nto be infallible. His jurisdiction is executive and judicial, and he is\r\nprotected by the czar of Russia, who enforces his edicts.\r\n\r\nNo people have suffered so much for their religion, not even the\r\nchildren of Israel, as the Armenians, and the atrocities committed\r\nupon them during the thirty years of the reign of Abdul Hamid, the\r\nlate sultan of Turkey, were the most barbarous that modern history has\r\never recorded. I do not remember that ever before, at least in modern\r\ntimes, the sovereign of a country deliberately set about to exterminate\r\nby massacre the subjects of his authority. There is no longer any\r\nquestion that “The great assassin, the unspeakable Turk,” as Mr.\r\nGladstone called him, gave the instructions that led to the slaughter\r\nof nearly 100,000 innocent inhabitants of his province of Armenia, the\r\ndestruction of their homes, the plundering of their property, and the\r\nviolation of their wives and daughters. Even if there had been any\r\nprevious doubt of his guilt, documents found in the Yildiz Kiosk after\r\nhe was deposed, established the fact that he had a deliberate intention\r\nto depopulate Armenia by the torch and the sword in a systematic and\r\nthorough manner.\r\n\r\nIt has long been conceded that a Mohammedan cannot govern believers\r\nin other religions with justice, but how far Abdul Hamid was actuated\r\nby fanaticism, how far he applied religious prejudices for political\r\npurposes, or whether he was afraid that the Armenians would ultimately\r\nsucceed in throwing off his yoke, are conjectures upon which students\r\nof Turkish affairs will never agree. He knew from the events of the\r\npast that he could never convert the Christian inhabitants of his\r\nempire to Islam by the sword, because the persecution which the\r\nArmenians had suffered for centuries only strengthened their faith,\r\nbut no sultan since Selim the Inflexible ever did more to stimulate\r\nreligious intolerance and encourage his Mussulman subjects to persecute\r\nhis Christian subjects, than Abdul Hamid in Bulgaria and other parts of\r\nhis empire as well as Armenia.\r\n\r\nThe Armenians who inhabit the northern part of Asia Minor along the\r\nsouthern coast of the Black Sea are a simple, quiet, primitive people\r\nof agricultural and pastoral pursuits. They live in small villages,\r\nand are devoted to their families and their religion. For centuries\r\nthey have suffered from the depredations of the Kurds, migratory,\r\nhalf-civilized tribes who haunt the mountains during the summer but\r\nin winter come down to the plains and either quarter themselves upon\r\nthe Armenian peasants or plunder them. Some villages pay regular\r\nblackmail, as the Scottish farmers used to do to protect themselves\r\nfrom troublesome Highland clans. Sometimes the Armenians defended\r\nthemselves, but while they have not lacked courage, as their records\r\nshow, very few had arms and those who did purchase guns and ammunition\r\nwere in constant peril of arrest for conspiracy. Occasionally when\r\nthey resisted the invasions of the Kurds, their villages were entirely\r\ndestroyed and the inhabitants put to the sword, men, women, and\r\nchildren alike, with a ferocious brutality in which Turkish soldiers\r\ninvariably joined with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWhile a large majority of the Armenian population lived pastoral\r\nlives, caring nothing for the rest of the world, without any ideas\r\nof constitutional freedom or national independence, many of the young\r\nmen drifted to the cities, where they prospered and became prominent\r\nand influential. They are thrifty and shrewd in trade. It is a common\r\nsaying that it takes two Jews to cheat one Greek, and two Greeks to\r\ncheat one Armenian; but as a rule the members of that race have a high\r\nreputation for integrity as well as sagacity, and the late sultan,\r\nhimself their bitterest enemy, trusted his finances to Armenians, as he\r\ntrusted his life to Albanians in preference to Turks.\r\n\r\nGradually the mercantile affairs, the manufacturing, the banking, and\r\nother lines of business in the principal cities of Turkey have become\r\nabsorbed by Armenians, Greeks, and Jews, for the Turk is no trader, and\r\nthe Armenians are the most enterprising and successful of all.\r\n\r\nThere was no act of disloyalty until they recognized the significance\r\nof the persecution of their people at home. They accepted their long\r\nyears of agony and despair as the penalty of their religion, but when\r\nAmerican missionaries planted schools and colleges in Turkey and\r\nbegan to educate the young people, a new spirit of national pride\r\nand hope gradually developed. Thousands of Armenians, and among them\r\nsome of the ablest leaders and most influential thinkers, received\r\ntheir first impulses and aspirations for civil and religious liberty\r\nat Robert College, an American institution on the Bosphorus, and in\r\nother colleges of the American Board of Foreign Missions in different\r\nparts of Asia Minor. This racial pride and spirit first found its\r\nexpression in attempts to improve the intellectual condition of their\r\nown families, in the emancipation of their women, in a revival of the\r\nuse of the Armenian language, which had been very largely superseded\r\nby the Turkish, and the enlightenment of the common people as to the\r\nrights and privileges to which all human beings are entitled.\r\n\r\nHaving the example of Bosnia and Bulgaria always in mind, the sultan\r\nundoubtedly suspected that the Armenians were preparing for a struggle\r\nfor freedom and determined to check it by extermination if necessary.\r\nHis intentions soon became known. When an Armenian was murdered or\r\nrobbed, his assailant was rewarded, and the more Christians the Kurdish\r\nchiefs could kill the more rapid was their promotion. The prisons\r\nwere filled with innocent men, the schools were closed, the Armenian\r\nlanguage was forbidden, Armenian books were seized and burned, and\r\nAmerican missionaries were prohibited from teaching anything that\r\nsuggested freedom. Their text-books and newspapers were censored and\r\nsuppressed if they were found to contain a sentence or even a word that\r\ncould be construed to reflect upon political conditions. One newspaper\r\nwas suppressed because it mentioned the dog star in a scientific\r\narticle on astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis was considered an insult to the sultan because Yildiz, the name of\r\nhis palace, is the word for star. Everything that related to Armenia,\r\nMacedonia, and other Christian provinces was stricken out; hymn books\r\nand even Bibles were censored; two professors in the missionary college\r\nat Marsovan were accused of teaching treason and condemned to death,\r\nbut were rescued by the British government at the very steps of the\r\nscaffold. All reference to the assassination of President McKinley was\r\nforbidden, lest it might suggest a similar fate for the sultan.\r\n\r\nArmenians in other parts of the world organized revolutionary\r\nsocieties, published revolutionary documents, and held conventions\r\nto consider revolutionary expedients. This defiance of his\r\nauthority exasperated the sultan and furnished the pretext for more\r\nviolent persecutions and more slaughter. Being unable to reach the\r\nrevolutionary organizers in other countries, he punished their\r\nrelatives, friends, and former townsmen by imprisonment and death, and,\r\nfinally, after many years of atrocious and barbarous treatment, he\r\nconceived a fiendish scheme of general massacre which was carried out\r\nby his officials with fanatical zeal under his directions. One of his\r\nministers remarked to an European diplomatist in Constantinople that,\r\n“according to his majesty’s notion, the best way to get rid of the\r\nArmenian question is to get rid of the Armenians.”\r\n\r\nIn order that they might do their work more thoroughly the half-savage,\r\nnomadic bands of Kurds were organized into companies by Turkish\r\nofficers, equipped with modern weapons, and turned loose with orders\r\nto provoke the Armenians to resistance, and thus furnish an excuse for\r\na general slaughter. Self-defence was always treated as rebellion. The\r\nbutchers who hunted helpless men and women like wild beasts and killed\r\nthem on the roadside or in the brush where they had taken refuge, who\r\nlooted and burned their homes and butchered their wives and children,\r\nwere promptly rewarded, and no one was ever punished. A succession of\r\nmassacres occurred all over Armenia, in almost every case begun with a\r\nsignal by a trumpet from military headquarters. The soldiers not only\r\nparticipated in the slaughter, but burned the homes of their victims\r\nafter plundering them, and both civil and official representatives of\r\nthe government directed the work of the mob. In many cases these\r\nmen were afterward called to Constantinople and decorated by their\r\nsovereign for the energetic manner in which the work was done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kibitkas of the Nomadic tribes]\r\n\r\nProminent men were offered their lives if they would renounce their\r\nreligion, and some of them did so, but very few. The great mass of the\r\nArmenians who died in those massacres were martyrs to their faith.\r\nSpecial efforts were made to force priests to apostasy. An official\r\ninvestigation showed that 170 Armenian clergymen in a single province\r\nwere tortured to death because they would not deny their Christ. In\r\nthe province of Kars is a group of sixty towns and villages in which\r\nno Christian church was left standing and no Christian priest was left\r\nalive. Investigation showed that 568 churches were destroyed and 282\r\nwere transformed into mosques. No one will ever know the extent of the\r\nmassacres, but, as accurately as can be ascertained, nearly 100,000\r\nArmenian Christians suffered martyrdom during the reign of Abdul Hamid\r\nby his orders, and it is believed that as many more who fled to the\r\nmountains perished from exposure and starvation.\r\n\r\nThe massacres of Armenians in October, 1895, which horrified the world,\r\nbegan in Trebizond, and I asked Doctor Crawford, an American who has\r\nspent thirty years in that country, his opinion of the causes and\r\nmotives.\r\n\r\n“For centuries the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire have\r\nsuffered continuous cruelties and persecutions,” said Doctor Crawford.\r\n“They have suffered from heavy taxation and unjust ways of collecting;\r\nthere has been no safety for their property, no protection for their\r\ncrops which were often stolen or destroyed, and their wives and\r\ndaughters were never safe. Most of this persecution was due to the\r\nKurds, their semi-civilized neighbours in Kurdistan, the adjoining\r\nprovince to Armenia on the east. Certain Kurdish chiefs levied\r\nblackmail upon Armenian villages for their protection. That is, they\r\nassessed tribute upon the inhabitants, in exchange for which they\r\nprotected them against other Kurds. Those who paid this tribute were\r\nsafe, those who did not were never secure, either in life or property\r\nor in their families.\r\n\r\n“Fifty or sixty years ago the Armenians began to emigrate; thousands\r\nhave gone to Constantinople and other cities; others to Europe and\r\nAmerica; and there are many thousands in the United States. Those who\r\nhad seen the world naturally realized the unfortunate situation in\r\nwhich their fellow countrymen were living, even more so than the latter\r\nthemselves, and began to devise means for their relief. They organized\r\nsocieties; they collected funds; they published newspapers, denounced\r\nthe iniquities of and conspired against the Turkish government.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the government learned of this movement, instead of\r\nrelieving the oppression, it bore down on the Armenians more heavily\r\nthan before. The situation was very much aggravated because the Turks\r\nhad discovered a pretext for their cruelty in the patriotic movements.\r\nAll mail matter was opened; everything that related to Armenia was\r\nsuppressed and destroyed; even the Bible was mutilated by tearing out\r\nthe leaves that bore the name of Macedonia, and every geography and\r\natlas had the name Armenia obliterated”--and Doctor Crawford showed\r\nme a copy of an English classical dictionary in which the text under\r\nthe word Armenia had been cut out. “It was proclaimed that the Turkish\r\ngovernment intended to wipe Armenia from the map of the world. The\r\nvery name was accursed to the Turks,” he continued.\r\n\r\n“But the innocent people at home were compelled to suffer for the\r\noffences of the Armenians abroad. Whenever any man received a letter or\r\na newspaper containing sentiments unfriendly to the Turkish government\r\nhe was cast into prison and often his property was confiscated.\r\n\r\n“This was going on for many years until on September 7 1895, a society\r\nof young Armenians of Constantinople marched in procession to the\r\nSublime Porte--which, you know, is the seat of government in that\r\ncity--and presented a petition begging for justice and protection\r\nfor their people at home. The Turkish government chose to interpret\r\nthis exercise of the right of petition as insurrection. The soldiers\r\nattacked the procession. Several Armenians were killed, many were\r\nwounded, others were thrown into prison, and every one who could be\r\nseized was maltreated. This incident was followed by many murders and\r\nraids in Armenian towns and villages and hundreds of innocent people\r\nwere slaughtered on the pretext that they were involved in a conspiracy\r\nagainst the government.\r\n\r\n“About thirty days later a government official who had been notorious\r\nfor his cruelties was shot at near Erzeroom, and, of course, the\r\nArmenians were charged with the responsibility. Retaliation was ordered\r\nand the governor of Trebizond received instructions from Constantinople\r\nto turn the rabble loose upon the Armenian population of that city. At\r\n11 o’clock on the morning of Oct. 8, 1895, a bugle was blown at the\r\nbarracks. This was the signal for slaughter, and every Armenian that\r\ncould be reached was murdered in cold blood. Six hundred bodies were\r\ncarried off in garbage carts and buried in a ditch outside this city.\r\nAt 3 o’clock that afternoon the bugle blew again, and at that signal\r\nthe mob began to loot the houses and shops of Armenians and did not\r\nstop until dark.\r\n\r\n“This massacre was repeated in all the towns and villages of Armenia,\r\nand it is estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 men, women, and\r\nchildren were slaughtered simply because they were Christians, and\r\nbecause some of their fellow countrymen had attempted to organize a\r\nconspiracy against the government with the hope of relieving their\r\ndistress and protecting them from persecution. There is no way of\r\ntelling how many were killed, but we know that 40,000 children were\r\nleft orphans. More than 6,000 fatherless and motherless little ones\r\nwere gathered into our own American orphanages. Altogether, $1,000,000\r\nfrom England and America was distributed for the relief of the\r\nsufferers.”\r\n\r\n“Is the hatred of the Turk for the Armenians due exclusively to\r\nreligious fanaticism?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“By no means,” said Doctor Crawford. “The Armenian is a very keen\r\nbusiness man, and the Turk is not. The Armenian is thrifty and gets\r\nahead, or at least he would do so if the government would permit him.\r\nHe is charged with usury. When he loans money he collects his interest\r\nand his principal and is usually very strict about it, which makes him\r\nunpopular. Baron Rothschild once said that if all the Jews and all\r\nthe Armenians were put upon a desert island together, the Armenians\r\nwould have all the money of both before they were rescued. But they\r\nare equally successful in the professions, and are eminent as doctors,\r\nlawyers, engineers, and especially gifted in oratory. Successful men\r\nare often compelled to suffer from the jealousy of those who are\r\nunsuccessful, and that is one of the chief causes of the persecution of\r\nthe Armenians in Turkey, as it has been of the persecution of the Jews\r\nin Russia.”\r\n\r\n“What is the present situation?”\r\n\r\n“Comparatively speaking, it is very favourable. There has been a great\r\nimprovement in the character and the conduct of the Turkish officials\r\nsince the adoption of the constitution; there is comparatively little\r\noppression; there is less corruption and blackmail; the lives and\r\nproperty of all citizens are comparatively safe; and there have been\r\nseveral cases of justice being granted to Armenians in the courts\r\nagainst their Turkish oppressors, something that was never dreamed of\r\nuntil within the last two years. A few Armenians have been appointed to\r\noffice, which is another extraordinary thing; all political prisoners\r\nhave been released; the spy system has been practically abolished; and\r\npeople are no longer afraid to express their opinions. There are many\r\nnewspapers and they are printed with the greatest freedom, but as a\r\nrule the social and moral conditions are worse than they were under the\r\ndespotism. What they call liberty we call license, because they do not\r\nknow any better. They construe the word liberty to mean the privilege\r\nof doing whatever they please, and many who have suffered horribly from\r\noppression are now retaliating because in a way there is no means of\r\npreventing it. There is more drunkenness, more disorder, more crime,\r\nmore stealing, more begging than ever before. People seem to lose\r\ntheir self-respect as well as their self-control when the restraint is\r\nwithdrawn. One of our Armenian pastors said in apology:\r\n\r\n“‘We must not expect fruit from a tree that has just been set out.’\r\n\r\n“What they need here more than anything else is good men, and that is\r\nthe work which the American schools are doing.\r\n\r\n“Formerly every man professing the Christian faith, from the date of\r\nhis birth to the date of his death, had to pay $2.50 tax a year in\r\nlieu of military service, because none but Moslems were admitted to\r\nthe army. That rule has been abolished and members of all religious\r\nfaiths, Jews and Gentiles, are now eligible for military service and\r\nare compelled to serve three years in the army when they become of\r\nage. Hence the increased emigration, which is becoming very large.\r\nSome of our most promising young men among the Armenians and Greeks\r\nare going to America. Three of our own native teachers left recently,\r\namong others, to work in shirt and collar factories of Troy, N. Y.\r\nOthers have gone to the shoe factories of Massachusetts, to work in\r\nrestaurants, and to engage in other business in the United States where\r\ntheir friends have gone before them and have found positions for them.\r\nDuring the last few months sixty promising young men from our little\r\nProtestant congregation have left for the United States, and thus our\r\nschools and churches are educating future American citizens.\r\n\r\n“This emigration is not entirely due to a desire to avoid military\r\nservice, but very largely to improve their condition. If there was a\r\ncommon foe, if Turkey was at war with some foreign power, the Christian\r\nyoung men would be perfectly willing to go into the army, but they are\r\nafraid of being sent to Arabia to suppress uprisings of Mohammedans, a\r\nduty from which no soldier ever returns, or to Macedonia to put down\r\ninsurrections of their co-religionists in that province.\r\n\r\n“The Turkish government is trying to make the military service more\r\nattractive for Christian young men and has commissioned several of the\r\nmost intelligent young fellows as officers. It is providing military\r\nschools for the education of Christian as well as Turkish cadets, and\r\nas soon as they are competent gives them posts in the gendarmes.\r\n\r\n“The cost of living in Armenia has been increasing gradually for\r\nseveral years,” continued Doctor Crawford, “which is a serious matter\r\nfor teachers as well as for the pastors of the Greek and Armenian\r\nchurches, who are very poorly paid and receive barely enough to buy\r\ntheir food. The pastor of our Protestant church is being urged by\r\nfriends to go to Dakota, where there are several prosperous Armenian\r\ncolonies. We have a neat little Protestant church here. Services in the\r\nArmenian language are held Sunday morning, in the Greek language in the\r\nafternoon, and in Turkish in the evening. Many Turks attend our evening\r\nservice--some from curiosity and some from interest. A thoughtful Turk\r\nis usually fair-minded. He is willing to hear what you have to say,\r\nalthough he is not easily convinced. Indeed, there is a great deal that\r\nis good in a Turk. He is charitable and hospitable; he is industrious\r\nand reasonably honest; and we can get along with him very easily\r\nif his religious prejudices are not excited and he is given a good\r\ngovernment.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MASSACRES OF 1909\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April, 1909, there was an organized uprising of fanatical Moslems at\r\nAdana, Kessab, and other towns in eastern Turkey, in which more than\r\n25,000 native Christians were massacred and four times as many lost all\r\nof their belongings by the burning of their homes. At Tarsus several\r\nhundred Armenian houses were destroyed, and at least four thousand\r\nrefugees were protected from massacre in the grounds and buildings of\r\nthe American College. At Antioch, forty miles south of Alexandretta,\r\nan Armenian population of 7,000 was nearly annihilated. Ruthless\r\ngangs of Kurds, Arabs, and Circassians attacked the small Armenian\r\nvillages, pillaging and burning the houses, and carrying the women\r\ninto captivity. Kessab, a thrifty Armenian town of 8,000 inhabitants,\r\nwas entirely destroyed and a large portion of the population was put\r\nto death. The Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, the residences\r\nof the American missionaries, an American high school for girls and\r\ngrammar school for boys were all destroyed. At Adana, Tarsus, and\r\nMersina the atrocities were beyond description, and the survivors of\r\nthe massacres were reduced to poverty and despair. All the Armenian\r\nvillages throughout that section were looted and burned, and the crops\r\nof the people were destroyed so that 50,000 helpless, innocent peasants\r\nfled to the mountains, where only starvation remained for them. It\r\nis estimated that not less than 25,000 people were massacred and more\r\nthan 100,000 were made homeless--the victims of a fiendish conspiracy\r\nfor which Abdul Hamid, the former sultan of Turkey, was directly or\r\nindirectly responsible. Appeals for help and protection came down to\r\nthe cities on the coast from scores of interior towns and villages,\r\nbut the local officials as a rule, knowing the reason and recognizing\r\nthe significance of the outbreak, dared not interfere, even had they\r\ndesired to do so. The consuls of foreign governments cabled information\r\nas promptly as possible. American physicians and teachers organized\r\nrelief forces, and Mr. Kennedy, an American missionary at Alexandretta,\r\neven persuaded a battalion of 450 Turkish soldiers to follow him to the\r\nrelief of Deurtyul, an Armenian city of 10,000 inhabitants, which was\r\nbesieged by a horde of Kurds and Circassians.\r\n\r\nThe officials of the American Red Cross at Washington, learning of\r\nthese horrors through the newspapers, appealed to the Department of\r\nState for information and got reports from all our consuls in this part\r\nof the world. The Honourable G. Bie Ravndal, American consul-general at\r\nBeirut, E. G. Freyer of the Presbyterian mission, and George E. Post of\r\nthe Syrian Protestant College had already organized a relief committee\r\nwhich was promptly equipped with the authority as well as the supplies\r\nof the American Cross.\r\n\r\nThe sum of $30,500 was sent immediately through the secretary of\r\nstate and the American ambassador at Constantinople and was liberally\r\nexpended in feeding the hungry, nursing the wounded, and providing\r\nfor the orphan children of the families that had been put to death.\r\nTemporary hospitals for the sick and wounded and barracks and tents\r\nfor the homeless were erected, provisions and clothing of all kinds\r\nwere supplied, and as soon as the actual suffering was relieved, seeds\r\nand implements were provided for the farmers so that they might be able\r\nto replant the crops that had been destroyed.\r\n\r\nMr. Ravndal, who had charge of the disbursements, says in his report:\r\n“In every instance we availed ourselves of the services of American,\r\nBritish, and German missionaries in the field, individually known and\r\nfully trusted by your committee, as distributing agents. Most of them\r\n‘went through’ the massacre of 1895, and thus acquired experience in\r\nrelief work. Among such field agents we would especially mention Rev.\r\nMr. Chambers at Adana, Rev. Mr. Dodds at Mersina, Rev. Mr. Kennedy at\r\nAlexandretta, Dr. Balph at Latakia, Rev. Mr. Maccullum at Marsh, and\r\nRev. Mr. Trowbridge at large, as having rendered valuable assistance.”\r\n\r\nSeveral heroes were developed and in every case the American\r\nmissionaries, both men and women, showed coolness and capability,\r\ncourage and influence, and demonstrated the respect and confidence with\r\nwhich they are regarded by the public. Nesbit Chambers, representative\r\nof the Y. M. C. A. at Adana, and Major C. H. M. Doughty-Wylie, British\r\nconsul at Mersina, and Mrs. Doughty-Wylie distinguished themselves\r\nespecially by their personal bravery, their presence of mind during the\r\nmassacres, and their devotion and self-sacrifice in relief work.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention of the United States to claim indemnity for\r\nthe murder of Rev. D. Miner Rogers and Rev. Mr. Maurer, Christian\r\nmissionaries at Adana, Turkey, during the massacres of April,\r\n1909, nor for the destruction of the schools, churches, and other\r\nproperty belonging to the American missions. In the first place, the\r\nmissionaries do not ask for damages. They do not wish to convert the\r\ndeath of two martyrs into money, but want to convert it into greater\r\nsecurity for their lives and their property in the future, and into the\r\nadvancement of the cause they represent. If the Turkish government will\r\ngive them greater freedom and broader privileges in their educational,\r\nmedical, and evangelical work, they will consider that Mr. Rogers and\r\nMr. Maurer did not die in vain.\r\n\r\nSome of the privileges desired have already been granted. Mr. Straus\r\nsecured for them firmins which give every American school and mission\r\nin Turkey rights and privileges that are not enjoyed even by Turkish\r\ninstitutions, and the title to every one of the 161 different property\r\nholdings of the American Board of Foreign Missions can now rest in\r\nthat organization instead of in the name of some individual, which was\r\nformerly necessary because the Turkish government would not recognize\r\nits corporate existence.\r\n\r\nThe government of the United States does not wish to claim indemnity\r\nfor the loss of American lives and property during the massacre,\r\nbecause the present government was in no sense responsible. On the\r\ncontrary, the massacres were a part of an unsuccessful conspiracy to\r\noverthrow it, and to punish the present administration for the hostile\r\nacts of its enemies would not only be unjust, but would weaken its\r\nstanding with the people. The Turkish government needs and deserves the\r\nsupport of the foreign powers, and has all the trouble it can attend to\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nThere is no longer any doubt that Abdul Hamid, the late sultan, planned\r\nand ordered a general massacre of Christians in Constantinople and\r\nother parts of the empire for Friday, the 14th of April, in order to\r\nforce the European Powers to seize and occupy the city. In that way he\r\nhoped to save his throne. This has been repeatedly admitted by those\r\nwho were in his confidence at the time. It was the last struggle of\r\ndespair, but Shevket Pasha, the commander of the troops that were\r\nloyal to the young Turks, received notice and pushed on so that he was\r\nable to attack Constantinople on the day previous, and thus prevent\r\nthe sacrifice of Christian lives and property at the Turkish capital,\r\nsimilar to that which took place at Adana, Marash, Tarsus, Aintab, and\r\nother places in central Turkey.\r\n\r\nIn every instance an officer of the sultan’s body-guard appeared at\r\nthe places where the massacres took place several days previous,\r\nbringing instructions to the officials and the police, and several\r\nlocal officials have since confessed that they were simply carrying out\r\norders received from Constantinople, and therefore are not responsible\r\nfor anything that happened. In certain places Moslem priests appeared\r\nand preached in the mosques, calling upon the people to make a holy war\r\nand kill all the Christians, beginning on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe mutiny of the regular army in Constantinople on the 13th of April,\r\n1909, was a part of the conspiracy, and on the 14th, after the regular\r\nsalamlik, or worship of the sultan at his mosque, they were expecting\r\nthe signal to be given for a general slaughter of Armenians, Greeks,\r\nand other Christians, as well as Europeans, similar to that which\r\noccurred years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is now an open secret that Tchelebi Effendi, the superior of the\r\nwhirling dervishes, and one of the most highly respected of the Moslem\r\nclergy, is the man who sent the warning to Shevket Pasha and the other\r\nyoung Turk leaders. I understand that he does not deny but claims the\r\ncredit of averting the proposed horrors.\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous outbreak in Constantinople and in various other parts\r\nof the empire is something more than a coincidence. That was the\r\nuniversal conclusion at the time, and now that Abdul Hamid is no longer\r\nable to punish those who interested themselves to save the lives of the\r\nChristians and the good name of Turkey, some of those who knew of his\r\nintentions are willing to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of lives and property in the interior of Asia Minor was\r\nappalling, but very little damage was done in Constantinople, because\r\nthe timely appearance of the Young Turk army from Macedonia prevented\r\nthe plan from being carried out.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the history of Turkey there are Christian\r\nsoldiers, Greeks, and Armenians in the regular army. Hitherto none\r\nbut Mohammedans have been considered worthy to wear the uniform,\r\nand Christian young men, instead of serving three or five years in\r\nthe ranks, were compelled to commute their service in cash, for an\r\nexemption they did not desire. The same applied to the Jews, who are\r\nalso found in the ranks for the first time. In Austria, which, as you\r\nknow, is a Christian country, Mohammedan soldiers from Bosnia and other\r\nprovinces are organized in separate companies, have their own barracks,\r\nofficers of their own faith, and cooks who are accustomed to preparing\r\nMohammedan food. They are regularly excused from duty on Friday, the\r\nMoslem Sabbath, and have mullahs for chaplains.\r\n\r\nThe Christian soldiers in the Turkish army are allowed to live apart\r\nfrom the Mohammedans; they are relieved from duty on Sunday, and are\r\ngiven leave to attend service in the Christian church. The Armenian and\r\nGreek patriarchs and the Jewish rabbis agree that they have no reason\r\nto find fault with the treatment of their co-religionists in the army,\r\nexcept that there are no Christian officers. This is due to the fact\r\nthat there has been no time to educate them and the government has\r\ngiven assurances that whenever it is possible to find the men, it will\r\ncommission Christian officers in proportion to the number of privates,\r\nand provide Christian chaplains. It is not considered desirable to\r\norganize exclusively Christian regiments, and thus far the Mohammedan\r\ntroops have made no complaint about having Christians quartered with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe greatest trouble in the army has been the retirement and dismissal\r\nof useless officers. Under the old régime, a cook or a hostler could\r\nsecure a commission and rapid promotion if he made charges against one\r\nof his superiors, or any person who was offensive to the government,\r\nand promotion was often earned that way. Abdul Hamid was very\r\ngenerous in rewarding treachery and the cheapest method was by giving\r\nmilitary rank. There were thirty-five marshals in the Turkish army\r\nwhen he abdicated, 250 full generals, 600 major-generals and enough\r\nbrigadier-generals to make a brigade.\r\n\r\nAll restrictions against the Jewish population of the Ottoman Empire\r\nhave been removed. Jews can come and go as they please, without\r\npermission and without passports, and the Haham Bashi, the recognized\r\nspiritual head of the Jews in Turkey, has been promised that the\r\ngovernment will confer full citizenship upon the Jewish population.\r\nIt is also disposed to encourage Jewish immigration, which has been\r\ntheoretically prohibited until now. It is understood that a movement\r\nis on foot to divert the movement of Russian Jews from the United\r\nStates into Turkey. Turkey has always been more favourable to Jewish\r\ncolonization than any other country in the East, and an enormous area\r\nof territory in Asia Minor and Mesopotamia which was formerly densely\r\ninhabited, will one day be capable of colonization by the construction\r\nof an irrigation system.\r\n\r\nThere should be no surprise at the attitude of the Mohammedans toward\r\nChristian soldiers, however, because the Sheikh-ul-Islam, who is\r\nthe head of that church, occupies a seat in the cabinet of the new\r\ngovernment with Jews and Christians, and has an active part in the work\r\nof reform. Shortly after the adoption of the constitution, he issued\r\na circular and caused it to be published throughout the Mohammedan\r\nworld, asserting the right of members of that faith to associate with\r\npersons of other faiths in conducting the affairs of the government.\r\nHe declared that nothing in the Koran conflicted with constitutional\r\ngovernment and that there was no reason why believers in other creeds\r\nshould not be recognized as having equal rights. He argued that the\r\nobject of all governments being the welfare and prosperity of the\r\npeople, it is clear that the claims of all should be considered as of\r\nequal strength and that the supreme authority should lie in the people\r\ninstead of in the king. In ancient times the king was the ruler, the\r\npeople were the servants, and everything was ordered to suit the\r\nking’s pleasure. But the Koran does not justify any such system. The\r\nking is not the ruler, but the servant of the people, and his highest\r\nduty is to find out the wishes of the people and to obey them.\r\n\r\nIn the same circular he explained that the Mohammedan population of\r\nTurkey was labouring under several delusions because they do not\r\nunderstand the Koran, which is written in Arabic, and has never been\r\ntranslated into Turkish. He promised that a translation should be made\r\nat once, because, if the people of Turkey cannot read the Koran, they\r\nwill naturally be ignorant concerning the sacred law, and are likely\r\nto fall into mistakes because of a lack of knowledge of the truth. The\r\nArab language is no more sacred than the Turkish language, and the only\r\nreason why the Koran was written in Arabic is that Mohammed was the son\r\nof an Arab, and knew that language better than any other. Inspiration\r\nis not a question of language.\r\n\r\nThroughout the interior of the country there has been no trouble\r\nbetween members of the different religious faiths; there have been\r\nno persecutions, no complaints of ill treatment from Christians on\r\nthe part of the Mohammedans, and even the Kurds, who are a barbarous,\r\nbrutal horde, living on the borders of Armenia, have made no raids and\r\ncommitted no robberies, but are showing the most friendly disposition\r\ntoward their Christian neighbours.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time for generations that the different religious\r\ndenominations in Turkey have been in such a friendly mood toward each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOne would not be apt to look for co-educational institutions in Turkey,\r\nbut a very prosperous one is Euphrates College at Harpoot in Armenia,\r\non the banks of the great river for which is was named. It is one\r\nof the largest and most influential of all the American colleges in\r\nTurkey, and was founded in 1876 by Dr. Crosby H. Wheeler, a human\r\ndynamo from the state of Maine. The first class graduated from the\r\nmen’s department in 1880 and from the women’s department in 1883, and\r\na good class has been turned out annually ever since. In looking up\r\nthe record of the graduates I find that the largest number of both\r\nsexes are teachers. Nearly all the unmarried alumnæ are at the head of\r\nschools and the married ones are the wives of teachers, ministers and\r\ncollege professors. Of the men graduates the second largest number are\r\nin business, the third are ministers, the fourth doctors, and the rest\r\nare scattered among the different professions, government officials,\r\ndruggists, lawyers, farmers, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe latest catalogue for 1910 shows 1,045 students in the various\r\ndepartments--540 men and boys and 505 women and girls--and the\r\nfinancial report shows that last year the institution came within\r\n$2,800 of being self-supporting. Its success is the more remarkable\r\nfrom the fact that it is co-educational in the face of traditions and\r\nthe prejudice of ages.\r\n\r\nDr. Wheeler was a man of tremendous energy and strength of character,\r\nand he left his impress upon the institution, but it has had other\r\nimportant men connected with it since his time. Dr. Caleb F. Gates of\r\nChicago, now at the head of Robert College, was president of Euphrates\r\nfrom 1898 to 1903. Dr. Henry Biggs has since directed its destinies\r\nwith great ability.\r\n\r\nHarpoot is the capital of one of the largest and most important\r\ninterior provinces of the Turkish empire, called Mamuretta-ul-Aziz. It\r\nis a city of some 20,000 inhabitants, situated on the top of a small\r\nmountain which rises abruptly from the plain a thousand feet below.\r\nThe plain stretches away to the Euphrates River and is one of the most\r\nfertile and densely populated sections of Turkey. The residence of\r\nthe governor is at the end of the mountain in a city called Mezereh,\r\nwhich in the last ten years has increased rapidly in population, while\r\nHarpoot has been practically at a standstill. There are other large\r\ncities like Malatea, two days to the west on the Euphrates River,\r\nDiarbekir, two days to the northwest, and Egin, still farther north,\r\nwithin the province.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that this centre of wealth and population should have\r\nbeen chosen by the American Board fifty years and more ago as a centre\r\nfrom which to carry on mission work for that district. The people were\r\nfound to be unusually intelligent and enterprising. They responded\r\nquickly to Western ideas which the missionaries brought into the\r\ncountry. It was from that province that the first emigrants to America\r\ncame in large numbers, and to-day there are probably more Armenians\r\nand Turks in the United States from Mamuretta-ul-Aziz than from any\r\nother single province in the empire, notwithstanding the fact that from\r\nHarpoot to the Black Sea is a journey of from four to five hundred\r\nmiles, and it is nearly the same distance to the Mediterranean on the\r\nsouthwest.\r\n\r\nThe people responded promptly to the suggestion of modern education.\r\nThis natural impulse was greatly fostered by the young men who came\r\nto the United States and reported the great value of an education in\r\nEnglish. It was but natural for the schools, started at the very\r\nbeginning of the missionary enterprise, to pass through a stage of\r\nrapid development until a college resulted, which was at first called\r\n“Armenia College,” because Harpoot is really in the heart of ancient\r\nArmenia, and also because the students were mostly Armenians. When the\r\nTurkish government became suspicious of everything Armenian, it was\r\nnecessary to change the name of the college and accordingly it has\r\nsince been called “Euphrates College.”\r\n\r\nUnlike other American colleges in the Turkish Empire, it has been\r\nco-educational from the first, in that it has departments for both\r\nwomen and men. They are under the same administration, although, of\r\ncourse, it is impossible for the two sexes to mingle in the same school\r\nrooms and only in a few cases in later years have they been able\r\nto recite together. From the first, however, teachers in the boys’\r\ndepartment have also had classes in the girls’ department, and the\r\ninstitution has been under a single president. The girls’ department\r\nhas had a separate head, holding the title of dean.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning the college has been overcrowded with students.\r\nThe Armenians, instinctively eager for advancement, with unusually\r\nalert minds, saw at once the commercial value of modern education for\r\ntheir sons. At the same time, not a few of them realized the value\r\nof education for their daughters. We cannot be sure what advantages\r\nwere uppermost in their thoughts in discussing this matter among\r\nthemselves, but perhaps a statement made by a widowed mother who, at\r\ngreat sacrifice, put her daughter into the school, may show one side of\r\nthe question. “I am perfectly willing to make the sacrifice,” she said,\r\n“because I know in the end I shall get the money all back, and more.\r\nIf my daughter marries, with her present ignorance, she will have to\r\nmarry a farmer or a common labourer. If, however, I can give her a full\r\ncollege education, she will marry a preacher or a teacher or some other\r\nprofessional man who will have a much larger income and hold a position\r\nof greater honour.”\r\n\r\nAs a result of the general sentiment in favour of the education of\r\nwomen which prevails in the entire province, the girls’ college has\r\nbeen prosperous from the beginning. A large proportion of the expenses\r\nwere met by the parents, they were so eager to have their girls\r\neducated. The latest catalogue shows 74 girls in the college, 60 in\r\nthe high school and 247 in the lower departments, making 381 in all.\r\nSome of the graduates who have had post-graduate courses in other\r\ninstitutions are employed as teachers. As a result of its influence\r\nand the desire of the people for a more liberal education for their\r\ndaughters, flourishing girls’ schools have sprung up in various parts\r\nof the province, some of them reaching the high school grade. These\r\nare, for the most part, supported by the people themselves, but the\r\nteachers are provided from the American College.\r\n\r\nThe boys’ college has followed practically the same course as other\r\nAmerican colleges in the Turkish Empire, except that the number of\r\nstudents has been unusually large and almost wholly from the Armenian\r\nrace. There have been a few Syrian students, and some other races are\r\nrepresented, but a great majority are Armenians.\r\n\r\nThe total number of students in the institution has sometimes passed\r\none thousand, and the average attendance in the college department\r\nalone has usually stood at about two hundred. A majority of the one\r\nthousand have been in grades below the high school, but all under the\r\ngeneral administration of the college. Seven years ago 34 per cent.\r\nof the students in the college came from within a radius of fifteen\r\nmiles, immediately adjacent to Harpoot. But since then 56 per cent.\r\nhave come from outside that radius. In the meantime the increased\r\ninterest in education has caused other important schools to grow up in\r\nthe vicinity, which have relieved the local pressure upon the college,\r\nallowing it to take more students from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe college is recognized as a strong force in that part of Turkey.\r\nIt is the only institution of its grade for a population of three or\r\nfour millions of people. Eastward to Persia, southward into Mesopotamia\r\nand northward to the Black Sea, it has the entire field to itself for\r\nthe higher education of both men and women. It is the model upon which\r\ngovernment institutions are now being established, and the faculty are\r\noften called upon to aid the officials in organizing and conducting\r\nthem. It has had close relations with the government for at least\r\ntwenty years, being recognized officially as an American college, with\r\na charter from the Imperial Turkish government, and its commanding\r\nposition at the head of the educational work of all that part of Turkey\r\nis acknowledged by all classes.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the massacres of 1895, the college, which then\r\nhad practically its entire plant burned out, took a prominent part in\r\nlooking after the thousands of orphans that were left in the district.\r\nIt was a leading force for some years in relief work; thousands of\r\ndollars of relief funds passed through the hands of its treasurer and\r\nwere distributed under the direction of the then president, Caleb F.\r\nGates, D.D., LL.D., now president of Robert College at Constantinople.\r\nThe industrial enterprises started then to give employment to the\r\ndestitute have been maintained, including weaving, lacemaking,\r\ntailoring, and other trades which are taught to the students, and\r\nthrough which they are able to earn at least a part of their tuition.\r\n\r\nThe teaching force of the college numbers forty-five, including six\r\nAmericans, all the rest being natives with the exception of one Swiss\r\nteacher. Two of the native teachers have taken graduate courses in\r\nEurope, one is now taking a post-graduate course in America; three or\r\nfour who were formerly teachers in the college are now studying in\r\nAmerica at their own expense, with the expectation of returning later\r\nto resume their work.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the college there has been for fifty years a\r\ntheological seminary for training young men for the Christian ministry.\r\nIt was at first a part of the college itself, but when the college was\r\nput under an independent board of trustees in America, it was separated\r\nfrom the rest of the institution, and has remained a part of the\r\nmission plant.\r\n\r\nIn the early days the college had a printing establishment and\r\npublished a monthly paper in English which circulated among the\r\nEnglish-speaking people of the country, especially among the friends of\r\nthe college in America. When the Turkish government became suspicious\r\nand the censors began their work of suppression, this printing press\r\nwas stopped and the government seal was put on it to prevent its being\r\nused in the future. The college was even fined fifty dollars for having\r\nrun a press without official sanction. For twenty-five years the press\r\nwas silent, but as soon as the constitution was proclaimed, one of the\r\nfundamental principles of which is a free press, the college printing\r\noffice at Harpoot was again started and has met with no government\r\ninterference up to the present time. New furniture has been secured and\r\nthe work goes on satisfactorily. Before the press was stopped, a large\r\nnumber of text-books for the use of the college and lower schools had\r\nbeen published. Fearing that the work might be interfered with, the\r\nRev. Crosby H. Wheeler, D.D., founder and at that time president of the\r\ncollege, ran the press to its full capacity up to the very moment the\r\npolice appeared. In this way a supply of text-books was produced which\r\nstood the educational work well in hand during the period of silence.\r\n\r\nOne cannot speak of this large station of the American Board without\r\nreferring to the medical work. Dr. West, the first medical missionary\r\nat Sivas, had for one of his students and assistants a bright young\r\nArmenian who later took up practice himself at Harpoot. Because of his\r\nthorough training he was able to supply in large measure the medical\r\nneeds at that city. For years he attended the missionaries and their\r\nchildren. Later there was a loud call for an American physician, so\r\nthat ten years ago it was decided to begin medical work. A commodious\r\nhospital was erected at the foot of the hill on the plain below\r\nHarpoot, which was formally opened only in the fall of 1910, with the\r\ngovernor and higher officials present, all speaking in high terms\r\nof approbation of the missionary doctors and their benefits to that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs a branch of this station, medical work has been established in\r\nDiarbekir, nearly one hundred miles to the south, with funds left in\r\na legacy by an Armenian formerly connected with the mission school in\r\nthat place and afterward a prosperous merchant in the United States.\r\nHe was so much interested in missionary work, especially in his native\r\ncity, that he gave $10,000 for the construction of a hospital and\r\n$20,000 as an endowment for its continuous support.\r\n\r\nHospitals and dispensaries in Turkey are far more nearly\r\nself-supporting than similar institutions in Europe and America.\r\nThe people are always ready to pay for medical attendance and for\r\nmedicines. Some of the mission hospitals are wholly self-supporting;\r\nmany are partly so. Men of wealth who have received substantial help\r\nfrom Christian hospitals often give liberally for the up-keep of those\r\ninstitutions in order that those who cannot pay for what they receive\r\nmay be treated free.\r\n\r\nIn Harpoot are two large Protestant churches, with smaller churches in\r\nall of the centres of population, and in the villages of the field.\r\nProtestant principles have become widely disseminated and the relations\r\nbetween Christians and Mohammedans are cordial and friendly. Conditions\r\nare very different now from what they were a few years ago in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE RESULTS OF AMERICAN MISSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere in all the world, not even in China or Japan, are the results\r\nof the labours and influence of American missionaries more conspicuous\r\nor more generally recognized than in the Ottoman Empire. They have\r\nnot confined themselves to making converts to Christianity, but their\r\nintelligence and enterprise have been felt even more extensively and\r\neffectively in the material than in the spiritual improvement of the\r\npeople. The first electric telegraph instrument in Turkey was set up\r\nby missionaries. They introduced the first sewing machine, the first\r\nprinting press, and the first modern agricultural implements. They\r\nbrought the tomato and the potato and the other valuable vegetables\r\nand fruits that are now staples; they built the first hospitals; they\r\nstarted the first dispensary and the first modern schools. Before they\r\ncame, not one of the several races in Turkey had the Bible in its own\r\nlanguage. To-day, thanks to the American missionaries, every subject of\r\nthe Turkish sultan can read the Bible in his own language, if he can\r\nread at all.\r\n\r\nBut a large volume would be necessary to tell what I would like to say\r\non this subject. Mr. Bryce, the British ambassador to Washington, in\r\none of his books, says: “I cannot mention the American missionaries\r\nwithout a tribute to the admirable work they have done. They have been\r\nthe only good influence that has worked from abroad upon the Turkish\r\nEmpire.” Sir William Ramsey, the famous British scientist, who has\r\nspent much time in Turkey, is quite as enthusiastic, and I could quote\r\na dozen other equally competent authorities as to the character of the\r\nmen and the results they have accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn the division of territory the Presbyterians have Syria, the\r\nUnited Presbyterians Egypt, while European Turkey and Asia Minor are\r\noccupied by the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions,\r\naffiliated with the Congregational Church, with headquarters at\r\nBoston. There are several Church of England missions, but no central\r\norganization. The Swedish, German, and Swiss Lutherans have schools,\r\nchurches, and orphanages. The French Roman Catholics have schools and\r\nhospitals in Asia Minor in charge of Capuchin and Franciscan monks,\r\nbut the chief missionary work in Turkey--educational, benevolent, and\r\nevangelical--has been done by agents of the American Board since 1820,\r\nwhen two pioneers, Pliny Fisk and Levi Parsons, landed at Smyrna and\r\nbegan to prepare themselves for preaching and teaching, by learning the\r\nnative languages.\r\n\r\nThe actual number of central stations of the American Board of Foreign\r\nMissions in Turkey in 1910 is seventeen, at which 159 American born\r\nmissionaries are engaged. There are 263 out-stations, with 1,032 native\r\nProtestant pastors and labourers, and 46,131 adherents; and 444 schools\r\nand colleges with an average attendance of 23,846 students. This is the\r\nsummary of returns for the year 1910.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters from which the campaign of evangelization is\r\ndirected is called the Bible House in Stamboul, the native section\r\nof Constantinople, which was built in 1871 and is to-day the most\r\nfar-reaching lighthouse in all the East. Its rays penetrate to every\r\ncorner of the Ottoman Empire. Here are the offices of administration,\r\nthe depository of the Bible Society, the printing plant and publication\r\nhouse, the treasury, the library, the information bureaus, and other\r\nbranches of the work. If you ever want to know anything about missions\r\nor missionaries in the near East, individually or collectively, their\r\npersonnel, their purposes, or the results they have accomplished, or\r\nanything about American education and charitable work in Turkey, write\r\nto the Bible House, Stamboul, Constantinople, and if you have any money\r\nto contribute toward the expenses of the great work that is going on,\r\nsend it there to Dr. Peet.\r\n\r\nThe most far-reaching work of the American missionaries is educational,\r\nwhich comprehends all races, all religions, and all languages. They\r\nare educating representatives of every one of the many different\r\nraces of which the Turkish Empire is composed, regardless of\r\nreligious faith--Turks, Arabs, Egyptians, Armenians, Kurds, Persians,\r\nMacedonians, Bulgars, Druses, Nestorians, Greeks, Russians, Georgians,\r\nCircassians, and others too numerous to mention. Their influence is\r\nthus extended to every community, because no student leaves an American\r\ninstitution without carrying with him the germs of progress which must\r\naffect the family and the neighbourhood and all of the inhabitants\r\nwith whom he may thereafter come in contact. This influence has been\r\nworking for half a century or more and has been preparing the minds\r\nof the people for the great change that has recently come over them.\r\nThe missionaries do not teach revolution; they do not encourage\r\nrevolutionary methods, but they have always preached and taught\r\nliberty, equality, fraternity, and the rights of man.\r\n\r\nThe congregations of the American churches, and especially the pupils\r\nof the missionary schools, are usually reduced from 25 to 30 per cent.\r\never year by immigration to the United States. Having learned from\r\ntheir teachers of the advantages and the opportunities that exist\r\nacross the water, having acquired the English language, and being able\r\nto get good advice as to location and often letters of introduction,\r\nthey have decided advantages over ordinary emigrants and for the same\r\nreason they make the best sort of citizens when they reach their new\r\nhomes. It had been very difficult for an emigrant to leave Turkey until\r\ntwo years ago, but somehow or another, there has been a constant stream\r\nrunning that way for a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nA dozen missionaries have told me that the brightest and most\r\npromising young men and women in their districts, and especially the\r\nbest teachers in their schools, have emigrated. Many of them go to\r\nMassachusetts, Chicago has thousands, and there is a large colony\r\nin Troy working in the shirt and collar factories. For example, the\r\nchurches at Harpoot had 3,107 members one year and 2,413 the next. The\r\nbalance had gone to America. One fourth of the congregation of the\r\nmission church at Bitlis emigrated, almost in a body, last year. It\r\nwould be a great deal better for Turkey if these people would stay at\r\nhome and use the knowledge and the principles they have gained in the\r\nregeneration of their country, but it cannot be denied that they are\r\namong the most valuable immigrants of all the aliens that go to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMost of the mission churches are small, like those in the villages of\r\nthe United States, with congregations of only twenty-five or thirty\r\nor fifty members. Those in the cities are larger, several having more\r\nthan a thousand members. They are organized just like the Protestant\r\nchurches in the United States with native pastors and native church\r\nofficers. They have Sunday schools, prayer meetings, Christian Endeavor\r\nsocieties and other organizations, and they study the same Sunday\r\nschool lessons as the Protestant children in the United States.\r\n\r\nMost of them are self-supporting. Sometimes the newly organized\r\ncongregations get a little help from the United States at the start,\r\nbut the great majority of native converts pay more for their religion\r\nand make greater sacrifices than the Christians of the United States.\r\nFor example, thirteen out of twenty-seven churches in the Central\r\nTurkish mission are not only entirely self-supporting but contribute\r\nsubstantial aid to weaker churches in their neighbourhood. In the\r\nentire Turkish Empire last year the native churches paid five sixths of\r\nall the expenses of education, worship, and charity.\r\n\r\nThe board pays the salaries of the missionaries, but the effort is to\r\nbring the native churches to a condition of pecuniary independence\r\nfor the reason that it stimulates their pride and their ambition; it\r\ngives them confidence and self-respect, which, as everybody knows,\r\nare the strongest elements in the formation of national as well as\r\nindividual character. Notwithstanding the extension of the work, the\r\namount of money contributed by the United States for the support of\r\nnative churches has been growing smaller every year. Whereas the board\r\ncontributed $54,585 to assist native churches twenty years ago, in\r\n1910 it gave less than $20,000.\r\n\r\nThe most significant feature of the statistical reports of American\r\nmissions in Turkey is the column which gives the contributions of the\r\nnatives for the support of their churches. In 1910, the total was\r\n$119,987, an increase from $92,937 for the year 1903.\r\n\r\nThis is very remarkable, and means ten times as much as the same\r\namount would mean in America, because of the poverty of the people\r\nand the fact that the earnings of the great mass of native Christians\r\ndo not often exceed thirty or forty cents a day. This money is given\r\nvoluntarily for the erection and support of houses of worship, for the\r\nsalaries of their native pastors, and for the circulation of religious\r\nliterature. It may safely be said that no Christian community in the\r\nworld, unless it be the Roman Catholics of Ireland, contributes so\r\nlarge a portion of its income for religious purposes as the native\r\nProtestants of Turkey. Because of the liberality of the people in this\r\nrespect the Protestant church in Turkey has been able to enjoy the\r\nministration of educated pastors. This accounts also for the large\r\nattendance of natives upon the American schools, which derive a larger\r\nproportion of their income from tuition fees probably than any other\r\nschools of their class in the world. This is particularly true of the\r\nAmerican colleges. No college these days pretends to live, and few\r\ncould survive without, endowments, but the American colleges in Turkey\r\nare more dependent upon their tuition fees and less dependent upon\r\nendowments for support than any similar institutions in existence.\r\n\r\nIn making a comparison of the American and Turkish schools, Dr.\r\nCrawford, a veteran missionary teacher at Trebizond, said:\r\n\r\n“Although the Department of Public Instruction at Constantinople is\r\nmaking noble efforts to improve the schools of Turkey, they still are\r\nlimited in quantity and poor in quality. The Mohammedan schools are\r\ntaught by priests, who are themselves, with few exceptions, illiterate.\r\nThe pupils sit on the floor of a mosque swaying back and forth,\r\nstudying about the three ‘R’s’--reading, writing and ’rithmetic--and\r\nthe Koran, of course. They pay more attention to that than to anything\r\nelse, and, indeed, some of the mullahs are so illiterate that they\r\nwould not be able to read anything else. Of late the Turkish officials\r\nhave begun to recognize the usefulness of Christian schools and not\r\nonly tolerate them, but are introducing their methods to a degree\r\ninto the mosque schools. With a liberal and intelligent minister of\r\neducation there ought to be a decided improvement in the Turkish\r\nsystem of instruction, but there will be great difficulty in securing\r\nteachers. Of course, women teachers cannot be utilized and men who have\r\neducation enough to qualify them to teach properly can get positions\r\nunder the government or elsewhere that pay much better salaries than\r\nteaching school.\r\n\r\n“The Greeks have excellent schools and their people show a craving for\r\nknowledge which is characteristic of the race. The Roman Catholics have\r\nFrench and Italian schools for the colonies of those nations under\r\nthe instruction of Jesuits and Capuchin monks, and they are usually\r\nvery good. But the lack of education throughout the Turkish Empire is\r\ndeplorable, and if the American schools have done nothing else than\r\nstimulate a rivalry on the part of the other religious denominations\r\nand the government, the money that has been contributed to support them\r\nhas been well invested.\r\n\r\n“As a rule, both the Greek and the Armenian clergy are uneducated.\r\nMost of them are very little higher intellectually than the Turkish\r\nmullahs. Some of them can merely read the service, and no more. There\r\nis no inducement for educated men to go into the priesthood because the\r\npay is so small; altogether too small to enable them to live decently\r\nand to give their families the ordinary comforts of life. Educated\r\nmen cannot afford to become priests, and as education is not required\r\nin either the Greek or Armenian Churches, when a priest dies the\r\ncongregation select one of their own number who happens to be able to\r\nread and make him their priest. A bishop of the Armenian Church in this\r\nvicinity recently resigned to accept a government office, and gave as\r\nhis reason for doing so that his salary was not sufficient to support\r\nhis family and to educate his children.\r\n\r\n“Agricultural and industrial education is needed more than anything\r\nelse in order to enable the people to get the best profit from their\r\nlabour and to teach them to use modern labour-saving implements and\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n“It is the policy of the missionaries to make the natives do everything\r\nfor themselves so far as practicable, and native pastors relieve them\r\nof much of their labour except supervision. But at the same time the\r\nmissionary must drive new stakes and plough new ground and plant new\r\nseeds all the time to extend his sphere of influence. And he travels\r\nabout for this reason, holding religious services in the native\r\nlanguages and drawing believers together until he gets enough material\r\nto start a church. I know a man who preaches three times every\r\nSunday in three different languages in different places to different\r\ncongregations--Turkish, Armenian and Greek. And they have all kinds of\r\nschools to look after, from kindergartens to theological seminaries.\r\nThe latter are especially important because they furnish pastors for\r\nthe native churches. The faculties in the American colleges are nearly\r\nall natives, but the presidents, the deans, and the treasurers are\r\nalways Americans, and the boards of trustees are mixed.”\r\n\r\nIf you would attend a gathering of native pastors in Turkey you\r\nwould find that they compare favourably in appearance and manners\r\nand intelligence and education with the members of any conference or\r\npresbytery or ministerial association in the United States, and that is\r\none of the reasons why their work has been so successful. The Moslem\r\npriests and the clergy of the orthodox Greek and Armenian churches are\r\nalmost universally uncouth and illiterate men and the public in Turkey\r\nis prompt and keen in detecting the difference.\r\n\r\nPresident Angell, of the University of Michigan, who was United States\r\nminister to Turkey for several years, once said: “So far as Americans\r\nare concerned the missionary work in European Turkey and Asia Minor\r\nis and long has been almost exclusively in the hands of the American\r\nBoard. In no part of the world has that board or any board had abler\r\nor more devoted representatives to preach the gospel, to conduct\r\nschools and colleges or to establish and administer hospitals. Wherever\r\nan American mission is established, there is a centre of alert,\r\nenterprising American life, whose influence in a hundred ways is felt\r\neven by the lethargic Oriental life.”\r\n\r\nThe vital need, however, is chapels. Every congregation ought to have a\r\nhome and its own place of worship. It is not necessary to explain the\r\nadvantages. They are obvious. It is just ten times as important for a\r\nnative congregation in Turkey to have its own house of worship as it\r\nis for a congregation in the United States, and for the same reason.\r\nAnd, as a rule, the congregation in the United States has ten times the\r\nfinancial ability to provide its own house of worship as the little\r\ncircle of native believers in Turkey.\r\n\r\nEach of the one hundred and fifty-nine American missionaries in Turkey\r\nto-day has a district like the diocese of an Episcopal bishop, with\r\na dozen or twenty churches under his care. He visits them regularly,\r\nadvises with their pastors, superintends their schools, and exercises a\r\npaternal authority over the people. They consult him concerning their\r\ntemporal as well as their spiritual welfare, not only the members of\r\nhis congregation, but men of every class. No class of people in all\r\nTurkey are so trusted by the officials and the public and by every\r\nrace as the American missionaries. All classes accept the word of a\r\nmissionary without question. Money is intrusted to him for safe-keeping\r\nor for transmission to other hands without asking for a receipt, and\r\nit is a common thing for officials of high rank to seek counsel of\r\nmissionaries when they are in doubt or in danger. As a well-known\r\nwriter has said:\r\n\r\n“They know that in times of trouble the missionary is their best\r\nfriend, no matter how much they may have abused him in times of\r\nprosperity. They know that he will always do what he believes to be\r\nfor their best good, even though there may be a difference of judgment\r\nas to what is the best thing. In the midst of Oriental duplicity the\r\nmissionaries have established a reputation for speaking the truth. At\r\nfirst this was one of the severest puzzles to the Turks in the dealings\r\nof the missionaries with the government. They could conceive of no\r\nreason for telling the truth under such circumstances, so they were\r\ncompletely misled.”\r\n\r\nUnder the new régime, the missionaries are having their own way. They\r\nare being sought instead of seeking. Not only are they free to come\r\nand go and introduce American ideas and knowledge, but the government\r\nis taking away their best native teachers and is using them for the\r\neducation of more young men and young women who are needed to take\r\ncharge of the public schools.\r\n\r\nUntil the constitution was proclaimed missionary education and medical\r\nwork was seriously hampered throughout the Levant by the government\r\nauthorities, and the remarkable results that have been accomplished by\r\nthe American missionaries have been obtained in the face of all kinds\r\nof obstacles and embarrassments. Travelling permits were refused by\r\nthe police and neither the missionaries nor their native helpers were\r\nallowed to go freely from place to place. The missionaries, when buying\r\nreal estate, often have been required to give pledges that it would\r\nnot be used for religious or educational purposes. Twenty-nine years\r\nago the Protestants of Constantinople purchased a site for a house of\r\nworship, and the American ambassador has not yet been able to obtain\r\npermission for them to erect a building. Places of worship and schools\r\nhave frequently been closed by order of the officials. The residences\r\nand the school-houses of American missionaries have often been searched\r\nand books and manuscripts--even ordinary text books--have been seized\r\nand destroyed. Schools have been burned by local fanatics and several\r\nAmerican missionaries have suffered martyrdom.\r\n\r\nNo Moslem can be released from his religious obligations, and when\r\nhe renounces his faith and professes any other religion the only\r\npunishment is death. Hitherto the only safety for a convert was to\r\nflee from his country before his conversion became known. This is not\r\nstrange when it is considered that Islam is the political as well as\r\nthe religious system of the country; the judges of the courts are\r\ntheologians; the shariat, or code of laws, is based upon the Koran, and\r\nboth are grounded upon divine authority as set forth in the teachings\r\nof the Prophet.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this question with the late Rev. Herbert M. Allen, editor\r\nand founder of _The Orient_, the enterprising American missionary\r\nnewspaper, at Constantinople, whose death in 1910 was a sad loss to the\r\ncause of civilization in Turkey, he said:\r\n\r\n“The most imperative need of Turkey in an educational way at present is\r\na high-class theological seminary, such as you have in Chicago and New\r\nYork. Here we are in the land of the Bible. Nearly all the religions\r\nof the world originated in this section. Here the gospel was first\r\npreached. Turkey is occupied to-day with the same races that lived\r\nhere then, all of them preserving their memorials. I believe that a\r\nnon-sectarian theological seminary established here for the purpose\r\nof teaching Biblical history and comparative theology in a broad way\r\nwould appeal to every one of these races. The schools of theology\r\nthat we have to-day appeal only to those who intend to enter the\r\nProtestant missionary service, but a seminary on a university basis,\r\nlike that at Chicago, would draw ambitious young men from all races\r\nand denominations, and would undoubtedly receive sufficient patronage\r\nto become self supporting with the aid of the endowments that such an\r\ninstitution should command.\r\n\r\n“The weakness of the Greek and the Armenian Churches has been the\r\nabsence of an educated clergy. Their lack of influence among the\r\npeople; their lack of progress, and the diminishing respect that is\r\nshown to the profession is due to this cause. Such a seminary would\r\neducate leaders in thought and progress in the social and political, as\r\nwell as the religious, life of the country. And what this country needs\r\nmore than anything else is educated leaders.\r\n\r\n“The several races that make up the population of the Turkish Empire\r\nare all represented in the Armenian schools,” continued Mr. Allen,\r\n“but vary according to localities. In Armenia most of the students are\r\nArmenians; in the colleges nearer the coast and the commercial cities\r\nthe larger number are Greeks. As for Mohammedans, they are scattered\r\nand have been comparatively few in number until recently, but now the\r\neagerness for education is so great that a Moslem father will send his\r\nson to a Christian college without the slightest hesitation. They have\r\nno fear that their children will be proselyted by Christian teachers,\r\nand they know they will get a good education; that their morals will be\r\nprotected; that their health will be looked after, and that they will\r\nbe given a broad view of things. There is no difficulty in mixing the\r\ndifferent creeds. They all worship together and sit together in the\r\ndining-room and mingle in the playgrounds, as well as in the classroom.\r\nAnd they submit without the slightest hesitation to all the rules\r\nconcerning prayers and divine worship and the study of the Bible.\r\n\r\n“Outside of Constantinople, the American colleges have no competition.\r\nThere are some French schools and the Greeks have contributed plenty\r\nof money for the education of their own race, but they do not seem\r\nto know how to spend it. Not long ago I visited a Greek college near\r\nCesarea, endowed by a wealthy merchant in Constantinople. I found fine\r\nbuildings, well equipped, but everybody told me the schools scarcely\r\namounted to anything. The reason is that they have incompetent teachers\r\nand poor management and what is still worse, the lack of an ideal. The\r\nsuccess of the American schools and their popularity is due to the\r\nhigh American ideal that is maintained by the faculties. It combines\r\ndiscipline, punctuality, truth, honour, self-control, self-respect,\r\nand other virtues that are not always found in the Oriental, but which\r\nare just as essential for good citizens and well-rounded characters\r\nhere as anywhere else. We aim to make our students full men; to elevate\r\nthem to the highest standard of manhood, and that is the reason of the\r\ninfluence and the success of the American schools. We have practically\r\nno competition in that line of education.\r\n\r\n“Very often the same families who send pupils to us will first send\r\nthem to a French school to study French, but they afterward send them\r\nto us to get what they call the American training; that standard of\r\nmanhood and sterling character which most of our graduates have taken\r\naway with their diplomas.\r\n\r\n“There is an English school in Constantinople for the benefit of\r\nEnglish children, although other nationalities are admitted, and there\r\nare various other schools, but the American is the only nationality or\r\nreligious denomination that has ever attempted general educational work\r\nin Turkey.\r\n\r\n“What race is most responsive and appreciative of the opportunities\r\nfurnished by the American schools?\r\n\r\n“The Armenians by all means. From the beginning they have filled our\r\nschools. They are the most progressive element in the empire and they\r\nappreciate the value of education more highly than any other race.\r\nSeveral years ago, before Abdul Hamid showed his hostility to them,\r\nthe Armenians started what was called ‘The Union Educational Society,’\r\nwhich established primary schools in various parts of Armenia. When\r\nthe sultan began to persecute the Armenians the schools were closed\r\nand the society was converted into a political organization, but since\r\nthe revolution it has been re organized under an excellent board of\r\nmanagers and is doing good work, establishing schools in different\r\nparts of that province.\r\n\r\n“They already have opened sixty to my knowledge and the number is\r\nincreasing so fast that it is difficult to keep track of them. Mr.\r\nMinassian, a graduate of Yale, who took a post-graduate course in\r\npedagogy and applied sciences at Harvard, is the superintendent\r\nof these schools--and a very competent man. He could have been an\r\nassistant professor at Yale if he had been willing to stay there,\r\nbut he came over here to assist in the regeneration of his native\r\ncountry and is doing splendid work. He is making a special feature of\r\nagriculture and is teaching the young men, and the old men, also, how\r\nto get better results from the soil.\r\n\r\n“The missionaries in Armenia are considering the question of placing\r\ntheir common schools under his direction, and I think within a few\r\nyears it will be an accomplished fact, provided they can come to some\r\nsatisfactory understanding concerning the regulations. Armenia will be\r\nthe most progressive and prosperous part of the Ottoman Empire before\r\nmany years. The ambition of the people is unbounded; their national\r\npride is stronger and their industry is greater than that of any other\r\nrace. No people have suffered so much, but none has gained more than\r\nthe Armenians.”\r\n\r\n“Has there been any change in the policy of the government toward\r\neducation?”\r\n\r\n“Decidedly. The new government seems to be working very hard to\r\norganize an educational system throughout the empire and is copying\r\nEuropean methods. It is sending boys to foreign countries to be\r\neducated for teachers, and is also placing students in almost every one\r\nof the American colleges and high schools. Five government students\r\nhave matriculated at Robert College and five young women entered\r\nthe American College for Girls last winter to be educated at the\r\ngovernment’s expense as instructors in the national schools. When the\r\nAmerican College for Girls moves to its new location next year, the\r\nimperial government will start a school in their old building, with\r\nthe American college as its model. Normal schools and high schools are\r\nbeing opened as fast as competent instructors can be found, but the\r\ngreat obstacle to the extension of the school system is the lack of\r\nteachers and the inability to pay such salaries as will tempt educated\r\nmen to undertake the work.\r\n\r\n“The most significant and satisfactory feature of the new régime is\r\nthe recognition of Christian schools on the same basis as Moslem\r\nschools by the Department of Education. In the allotment of the\r\nfunds appropriated for education the American missionary schools are\r\nreceiving the same assistance as those recently organized by the\r\ngovernment.”\r\n\r\nIn the work of the American missionaries in Turkey, as in other parts\r\nof the world, printing presses are of importance. Without them little\r\ncould have been accomplished; slow progress would have been made.\r\nThere are two great publication houses in the near East, one under the\r\ndirection of the Presbyterian board at Beirut, and the other under the\r\nCongregational church in Constantinople. They are the most complete\r\nand modern printing plants in that part of the world, representing an\r\ninvestment of many thousands of dollars and equal to any of their size\r\nin the United States. The presses are going all the time, turning out\r\nan average of fifty million pages each a year in not less than ten\r\nlanguages. The output, since the presses were established in 1833, has\r\nundoubtedly been as large as that of any other printing house in the\r\nworld, and indeed there are few of longer or greater age or better\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nThe entire plan of missionary work in Turkey at the beginning was based\r\nupon the use of these presses, and within three years after the first\r\nmissionaries arrived in that field, a plant was set up on the island of\r\nMalta to furnish literature for Palestine and Turkey. It was considered\r\nunsafe to attempt at that time to do any printing on Turkish soil, and\r\nMalta, being under the British flag, was the nearest locality where\r\nthe presses could run without interruption. In 1833, the political\r\natmosphere having cleared, the Arabic outfit was transferred to Beirut\r\nin Syria, while the Greek, Turkish, and Armenian branches were set up\r\nin Smyrna. During the ten years at Malta, more than twenty-one million\r\npages were printed for the benefit of Greeks, Armenians and Turks. This\r\nincluded text-books for the elementary schools, which were chiefly\r\ntranslations of standard American editions. Then came the Bible, which\r\nhas since been translated and published entire in four different\r\nlanguages, and partially in several more, and distributed by millions\r\nof copies throughout the East.\r\n\r\nThe Bible was translated into Turkish and published at Smyrna in 1836.\r\nDr. Elias Riggs’s translation into Armenian was published in 1852, and\r\nhis translation into Bulgarian in 1871. The Arabic Bible, translated by\r\nSmith and Van Dyck, has since been issued from the Beirut press, and\r\nmore than 1,500,000 copies have been circulated.\r\n\r\nIn a single year the American press at Beirut issued 152,500 volumes of\r\ndistinctively Biblical literature, with a total of 47,278,000 pages, in\r\naddition to nearly 9,000,000 pages of text-books and other literature,\r\nmaking a total of 56,000,000 pages from that one plant.\r\n\r\nThis other literature consists of hymn books, school books of all\r\nkinds and of all grades, from kindergarten material to theological\r\nand medical works; picture books for children, Christmas cards,\r\nSunday-school lessons, story books, translations of standard works, and\r\nseveral original works by both native and American authors.\r\n\r\nThe work of Bible publication has since continued under the patronage\r\nof the American Bible Society and the British and Foreign Bible\r\nSocieties, until the entire Scriptures are now available for all\r\nTurkish, Arabic, Syrian, Persian, Armenian, Bulgarian, and Greek\r\nspeaking peoples, and the New Testament, the Psalms and other parts\r\nare available for Kurds and Albanians. It is bound in cheap form and\r\nconvenient size and sold at cost. Very few copies are given away.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Armenian claims to be the oldest branch of the Christian\r\nchurch, yet when the American missionaries came, they had only a few\r\nmanuscript copies of the Bible, kept in monasteries or in the larger\r\nchurches, carefully guarded by priests who were themselves unable to\r\nread the text, while the people were permitted only to kiss the covers\r\nwhich were often of solid silver. To-day, thanks to Dr. Elias Riggs,\r\none of the veteran American missionaries, every Armenian can have his\r\ncopy of the Scriptures in his own language at a nominal price. It is a\r\nsignificant fact that the editions are disposed of as rapidly as they\r\nare turned off the press, and it is asserted by competent authority\r\nthat this book has done more to unify and simplify the modern Armenian\r\nlanguage than all other influences combined.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the Bulgarian language. There was no Bulgarian\r\nliterature until American missionaries began to write it, and the\r\nmissionary presses began to publish it. Of the first one hundred books\r\nin the Bulgarian language seventy were issued by the missionary press\r\nat Smyrna and Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Kurds, a powerful and populous element of the Turkish Empire, had\r\nno written language and no literature of any kind until the American\r\nmissionaries created one for them and translated the New Testament into\r\nthe local dialect written with Armenian characters.\r\n\r\nThe Albanians had no literature when the Americans came, and it would\r\nnot be far from the truth to say that they have none now except what\r\nthe missionaries have given them.\r\n\r\nAlthough every Turk is a Mohammedan and the sultan of Turkey is the\r\nrecognized head of that faith, the Koran, the Moslem Bible, written by\r\nthe prophet Mohammed, has never been printed in the Turkish language,\r\nbut remains exclusively in the Arabic tongue, in which it is written,\r\nbut the Bible has been printed in Turkish for nearly seventy-five\r\nyears, and may be read to-day in his own dialect by every one of the\r\nmany races which constitute the Mohammedan world.\r\n\r\nWhen the Americans first began to issue literature in Arabic the\r\nscholars of that race criticised the type, which had been made in\r\nEurope and was about as perfect as English type would be if it were\r\nmade by an Arab. Rev. Eli Smith, who was in charge at that time,\r\nrealized that half the value of the American publications would be\r\nlost unless their typographical appearance met with the approval of\r\nthe artistic taste of Mohammedan scholars. The type did not exist and\r\nit was his duty to create it. He made models of the letters of the\r\nalphabet by copying them from choice Arabic manuscripts, and in 1836\r\nhe took them to Germany to be cast. The voyage ended in a shipwreck\r\nand all his work was lost in the waters of the Mediterranean. Dr.\r\nSmith, however, was a patient and persistent man. He began again at\r\nthe beginning and did it all over with the greatest care and fonts of\r\ntype were cast in the Tauchnitz establishment at Leipzig under his\r\nsupervision. After five years of patient labour, the first book was\r\nissued from the mission press at Beirut in 1841, and it was not only a\r\nmodel of the “art preservative,” but was undoubtedly the most perfect\r\nand beautiful specimen of Arabic printing ever seen.\r\n\r\nThen the work of printing the Bible was decided upon and Dr. Smith\r\nwas detailed to superintend it. It was the labour of his life, and\r\nno literary task was ever conducted with such conscientious care. As\r\nsoon as he had completed one of the books it was put into type, and\r\na hundred proofs were struck off and sent to educated Syrians and\r\nArabs and British, American and German scholars, whose criticisms were\r\ncarefully considered, and, after twenty-eight years of hard work by Dr.\r\nSmith and his successor, Dr. Van Dyck, the American press at Beirut\r\nissued a translation which has received the approval of all the real\r\nArabic scholars of the day.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to electrotype the pages and secure duplicate plates\r\nthat would insure its preservation forever, and that long and costly\r\nlabour, which involved probably the hardest task of proof-reading ever\r\nundertaken, has recently been completed by Dr. Franklin P. Hoskins of\r\nBeirut.\r\n\r\nThe mission press of Beirut, under Dr. Hoskins’s direction, had\r\nalready issued 1,535,266 copies of the Arabic Bible up to December\r\n31, 1909, which have been distributed among the Mohammedan races from\r\nthe Adriatic to the Yellow Seas. Thousands of copies have gone to our\r\nMohammedan wards in the Philippines. They are to be found in Yucatan,\r\nin Brazil, in the Argentine Republic, and at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nThere is a regular demand from every section of Asia and Africa, where\r\nmost of the followers of Mohammed live. They generally accept the Old\r\nTestament as history and claim the patriarchs and the prophets as their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the publication of the Bible, has been the work\r\nof producing text-books for the schools in the East. Like the general\r\nliterature, they are mostly reprints and translations of American\r\neditions, but they have to be adapted in a measure to local conditions.\r\nThe courses in the American colleges in Turkey are conducted in\r\nEnglish, but French, German, Turkish, and other languages are taught.\r\nFor these American text-books are used, the same as in our own\r\ncolleges, but for the common schools of the Turkish Empire an entire\r\nset of school books had to be created by the American missionaries,\r\nwhich have since been adopted by the government for local use.\r\n\r\nNo geography, or history, or arithmetic, or anything else in Turkish\r\nor the other ten languages in common use in that empire existed when\r\nthe Americans undertook their campaign of education seventy-five years\r\nago. They had to be prepared and printed with the sultan’s stupid and\r\nmalicious censors looking over the shoulders of the writers and the\r\nprinters and the proof-readers to prevent the publication of anything\r\nthat might reflect upon the benign policy of “the great assassin,” as\r\nMr. Gladstone called him, or suggest to the people ideas inconsistent\r\nwith their poverty and retrogression. Many amusing stories are told\r\nof the ridiculous rules and corrections made by these censors. Even\r\nthe text of the Bible had to be changed and certain passages omitted\r\nbecause they taught the doctrine of human rights and referred to\r\npenalties visited upon unjust rulers by God and man. The word Armenia,\r\nthe name of one of the largest provinces of the Ottoman Empire, was\r\nforbidden, and the name of Macedonia, another, was also placed upon the\r\nlist of terms that could not be used. The same rules that were applied\r\nby the censors to daily newspapers were applied to the Bible and all\r\nother books, but nevertheless the presses have never been stopped and\r\nthe influence of the literature they have issued is incalculable.\r\n\r\nFor two generations the two publishing houses of the American missions\r\nhave issued newspapers in Armenian, Greek, Bulgarian, Arabic, and other\r\nlanguages used in the Turkish Empire, which have had a wide circulation\r\nand a permanent influence among all classes. These papers contain\r\nreviews of current events, religious intelligence, stories and poetry,\r\nmiscellaneous information, and have been the only newspapers that have\r\nbeen allowed to circulate in certain portions of the empire.\r\n\r\n_The Orient_, a weekly founded by Herbert Allen and published by the\r\nBible House in Constantinople, for example, contains items of interest\r\nto the native Christian communities all over the empire. Among other\r\nthings I have found in it the best reports of the proceedings of the\r\nTurkish Parliament I have seen anywhere.\r\n\r\nMonthly magazines containing religious and general literature are\r\nissued regularly and have a large circulation. Theological and\r\nscientific discussions and the news of the scientific world are\r\npublished for the benefit of professional readers. In other words, the\r\nmissionary presses have been putting out for circulation throughout the\r\nTurkish Empire the same sort of literature that is expected from our\r\nown first-class publishing houses in the United States, to supply the\r\nneeds of people whose intellects are gradually awakening, to develop\r\nnative writers, and to create a demand for their writings, so that they\r\nmay live by their pens.\r\n\r\nThere have been many eminent and remarkable men among the American\r\nmissionaries in Turkey, and several of them have had remarkable\r\nexperiences. The career of the Rev. Dr. Elias Riggs stands unique in\r\nmissionary annals. For sixty-nine years he laboured in the Turkish\r\nEmpire, with only one visit to the United States. On that occasion,\r\nhe was invited to accept a professorship at Yale University, which he\r\npromptly declined in order to continue his missionary work. Doctor\r\nRiggs was a genius in languages. He was one of the most learned men\r\nof his time. He was the King of Translators. He translated the Bible\r\nand other books into all the languages of Turkey and Bulgaria. He\r\ntranslated many hymns into those languages, and many of his own verses\r\nare still sung in the Christian churches of the East. His entire life\r\nwas devoted to the labour of bringing Christian literature within\r\nreach of the numerous races which composed the Ottoman Empire, for no\r\nforeigner has ever known their complex dialects so well as he.\r\n\r\nAt one time there was a very stormy meeting of missionaries at\r\nConstantinople. Good men often differ in opinion and sometimes do not\r\nhesitate to criticise the opinions of others. If everybody thought\r\nalike this world would not make much progress. We all know that\r\nfriction makes the wheels go round. It was one of those occasions when\r\ngood men of strong character differ as to the proper course that should\r\nbe adopted, and the discussion was long and earnest, and sometimes\r\nso earnest that some of the wise and good men lost their tempers. A\r\nnew-comer, who was deeply interested in the debate and sat through the\r\nsessions for several days, asked one of his colleagues the name of “a\r\nlittle old man who has been present from the beginning and has never\r\nsaid a word.” The reply was:\r\n\r\n“That is Dr. Elias Riggs, and he is able to keep silent in seventeen\r\ndifferent languages.”\r\n\r\nAt the dedication of a new church in Smyrna, several years ago, the\r\nprogramme of exercises was made up so that every community in that\r\npolyglot city should be represented, and Dr. Riggs, who presided,\r\nintroduced each speaker in the language he was to use.\r\n\r\nDr. Cyrus Hamlin, founder of Robert College at Constantinople, was a\r\nmaster of colloquial conversation, which he picked up by contact with\r\nhis fellow men rather than from books, and, while he was not always\r\ncorrect in his moods and tenses, he never failed to make himself\r\nunderstood. He used to tell a good story on himself to illustrate the\r\ndifference between his own linguistic accomplishments and those of Dr.\r\nRiggs. He said that a learned Armenian, complimenting him upon the\r\nfreedom with which he spoke that language, remarked:\r\n\r\n“Dr. Riggs, he speaks the Armenian grammatic; but you speak Armenian\r\nidiotic.”\r\n\r\nDr. Riggs was never detected in a grammatical error in the use of\r\nthe seventeen languages with which he was familiar. Whether he was\r\nspeaking, writing, or translating, he used each language “grammatic.”\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Riggs was in the prime of his usefulness, a committee\r\npreviously appointed, finished a translation of the New Testament in\r\nthe Komanji language, which is spoken by a barbaric klan of Kurds\r\nin the mountains of northern Mesopotamia and the eastern section of\r\nTurkey. When the committee brought their manuscript to the printing\r\noffice at the Bible House in Constantinople, they were asked if they\r\nhad submitted it to Dr. Riggs. They replied promptly:\r\n\r\n“Dr. Riggs has never been in the Kurdistan mountains; he knows nothing\r\nof the Komanji language, and, therefore, we have never thought of\r\nconsulting him.”\r\n\r\nAnd they were very much annoyed at the pressure brought upon them by\r\npeople at the Bible House who insisted that the manuscript ought to\r\nbe submitted to the criticism of the greatest translator in the world\r\nbefore subjecting the board to the expense of putting it in type.\r\nThe committee was finally compelled to yield, and asked Dr. Riggs\r\nif he would spare them a few hours to listen to a reading of their\r\ntranslation. He readily consented, and came into the conference with\r\nhis well-worn old copy of the Greek Testament under his arm. As one of\r\nthe committee read the Komanji version of the Gospel of St. Matthew\r\naloud, Dr. Riggs followed him in his Greek text, and, in the middle\r\nof the second chapter, asked why they had translated a certain phrase\r\ndifferently from that given in the first chapter. The translators made\r\na note of the criticism and said they would look it up. They made a\r\nsimilar note of another criticism a short time later, and then several\r\nmore, and before they had finished the Gospel of St. Matthew, they\r\nturned the whole manuscript over for Dr. Riggs to review and were\r\nfinally compelled to put it through another thorough revision in which\r\nthey were guided by his advice.\r\n\r\nWhen he was quite a young man and shortly after he entered the field,\r\nDr. Riggs was thrown in with a party of Albanians for several weeks\r\nwhile travelling in that province. Twenty-five years later at a\r\nmeeting of the American missionaries in European Turkey, a committee\r\nwas appointed to arrange for the preparation and publication of an\r\nAlbanian grammar. During the discussion, Dr. Riggs said nothing, but\r\nafter a decision had been reached and a committee had been appointed,\r\nhe remarked quietly to the chairman that several years before, while\r\nin Albania, he had taken a few notes concerning the language and would\r\nbe glad to put them into the hands of the committee, who might find\r\nthem of some aid in their work. The chairman took the manuscripts and\r\nthanked him. When the committee met and came to examine the “few notes”\r\nof Dr. Riggs, they were astonished to find that they comprised an\r\nalmost complete grammar of the Albanian language, the fullest that had\r\never been undertaken, and it was the foundation of the text-book that\r\nwas shortly afterward published.\r\n\r\nThe value of the services rendered by Dr. Riggs to the people of\r\nthe various races which compose the Ottoman Empire can never be\r\noverestimated. He not only gave them translations of the Bible\r\nand other Christian literature, but furnished them the means of\r\nrecording their spoken languages. By his translations of the Bible\r\nhe accomplished for the Armenians, the Bulgarians, and other Turkish\r\nraces, what the King James Version of the Holy Scriptures accomplished\r\nfor the English language and the English-speaking people, and what the\r\ntranslations and dictionary of Dr. Hepburn did for Japan. He made the\r\nliterature of these races accessible to other scholars.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable linguist among the American missionaries in Turkey\r\nwas the Rev. Dr. William Gottlieb Schauffler, a native of Stuttgart,\r\nGermany, and a graduate of Andover. He was a very versatile man,\r\nbeing not only a great scholar and linguist, but a powerful preacher,\r\na skilful musician, a fascinating conversationalist, and a man of\r\nbrilliant social attainments. He translated the Old Testament into\r\nSpanish, and his work was published in Vienna. He also translated the\r\nentire Bible into the Osmanli-Turkish. His son, Rev. Dr. Henry Albert\r\nSchauffler, who was born at Constantinople, and educated at Williams\r\nCollege and Andover Seminary, was engaged among the Slavic population\r\nof Cleveland, Ohio, during the later years of his life.\r\n\r\nRev. Dr. Edwin Elijah Bliss, a graduate of Amherst College and Andover\r\nSeminary, went to Trebizond in 1843, and spent his life in missionary\r\nwork there and at Erzeroom, Marsovan, and Constantinople, where he died\r\nat a ripe old age in 1892. His principal and widely influential service\r\nwas the preparation and publication of books for other missionaries to\r\nuse among the natives; and he edited the mission periodical called the\r\nAvedaper for many years.\r\n\r\nThere was another famous missionary of the same name, Dr. Isaac Grout\r\nBliss, also a graduate of Amherst and Andover, who represented the\r\nAmerican Bible Society at Constantinople for many years. He raised\r\nthe funds and built the Bible House at Constantinople, which is the\r\nheadquarters of American missionary and educational work in Turkey.\r\n\r\nDr. Wilson Amos Fornsworth, a graduate of Middlebury College and\r\nAndover Seminary, and his wife, Caroline Elizabeth Palmer Fornsworth,\r\nwere, perhaps, next to Dr. Riggs, the longest in the service. They\r\nwere at Cæsarea from 1852 to 1903, a period of fifty-one years. During\r\nthis time, he travelled 75,000 miles in his missionary work, including\r\n30,000 miles on horseback.\r\n\r\nHarrison Grey Otis Dwight, D.D., who was one of the earliest\r\nmissionaries in the field, was a graduate of Hamilton College and\r\nAndover Seminary, and went out to Turkey in 1830, where he remained\r\nuntil his death in 1862. Doctor Dwight’s explorations in Asiatic\r\nTurkey and in Persia in 1831–32, led to the establishment of the\r\nAmerican missions in Armenia and Nestoria. He was a man of remarkable\r\ntalent, judgment, and discernment, and an intrepid explorer and pioneer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Mosque of Baku]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Persian quarter, Baku]\r\n\r\nThe late Justice Brewer of the United States Supreme Court, was the son\r\nof Rev. Josiah Brewer, one of the earliest American missionaries in\r\nTurkey, and was born at Smyrna in 1837. His mother was a member of the\r\nfamous Field family of Stockbridge, Mass., a sister of David Dudley,\r\nCyrus, Henry, and Stephen J. Field.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer of the education of women in Turkey was Eliza Fritcher,\r\na native of Millport, N. Y., and a graduate of Mt. Holyoke Seminary.\r\nShe set in operation and for more than thirty years managed a\r\nboarding-school for girls at Marsovan, which is now a large and\r\ninfluential institution.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Elizabeth Ely, and her sister, Mary Anne Ely, both graduates\r\nof Mt. Holyoke, also did very important work in the education of girls.\r\n\r\nMaria Abigail West, another pioneer, spent her life in strenuous\r\nservice among the women and children of Armenia. And there were many\r\nothers equally earnest and equally useful in the early days. It is a\r\nremarkable fact that no American missionary in Turkey has ever retired\r\nfrom that field because of a lack of interest or encouragement in the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE CASPIAN OIL FIELDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe railway across the Caucasus from Batoum on the Black Sea to Baku on\r\nthe Caspian Sea is 558 miles long, the distance from Batoum to Tiflis,\r\nthe capital of the Caucasus, being 218 miles, and from Tiflis to Baku\r\n340 miles. The latter route is almost a straight line, following the\r\nbroad valley of the river Kur, a swift and turbulent stream of water\r\nabout the same colour as our own Mississippi. For three fourths of the\r\ndistance the track runs at the base of the foothills of the Caucasus\r\nMountains, which are always in sight from the left hand windows of the\r\ncars going east. On the right hand is a broad prairie stretching out\r\nto the horizon, and with the exception of much low and swampy land the\r\ngreater part of it is closely cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe farmers do not live upon their farms, however, but stay in the\r\nvillages for mutual protection, which was necessary in ancient days,\r\nalthough they might be safe enough in these times if they lived in\r\nisolated places as our farmers do. It is very largely the custom all\r\nover Europe for the farmers to live in villages and go back and forth\r\nto their fields in the morning and at night. Scattered among the\r\ncultivated fields in the Caucasus are little huts of brush and sod,\r\nused as summer residences by the farmers, who bring out two or three\r\ndays’ rations with them, and after working in the soil all day crawl\r\ninto these miserable little shacks to sleep for the night.\r\n\r\nThere are many cattle and sheep upon the hillsides, and every herd\r\nand flock is attended by a shepherd, sometimes a man and sometimes a\r\nwoman, and often a child. Even the geese have to be attended as they\r\nmeander. No animal of value is ever left alone, and such attention is\r\nnecessary to keep them from straying into the cultivated fields, for\r\nthere are no fences. The property is divided by landmarks of stone;\r\nthere are no other boundary marks, and you wonder if the farmers do\r\nnot sometimes get into the wrong harvest field or plough up a piece of\r\ntheir neighbour’s land by mistakes.\r\n\r\nThere are a good many orchards of cherries, apricots, peaches, and\r\nother fruit, and a few vineyards, which belong to Germans. Wherever you\r\nsee a vineyard down in that country, you may rely upon it that a German\r\neither owns it, or has set out the vines on rented land. The Germans\r\nare altogether the best farmers and make the most money, because of\r\ntheir economical methods, their intelligent industry, and their thrifty\r\nhabits. About half way between Tiflis and Baku is a German colony that\r\nlooks like an oasis in the desert. It is surrounded by mile after mile\r\nof vineyards.\r\n\r\nWomen work in the fields on equal terms with the men without any\r\ndistinction of labour, and sometimes one is tempted to think that\r\nthey carry the heavier ends of the load. You see young girls ten and\r\ntwelve years old with hoe and spade when they ought to be in school or\r\nlearning to sew and bake in the kitchen. But the czar needs so many men\r\nin his army that their mothers and sisters are required to go into\r\nthe fields. You will notice, too, that women are switchmen and flagmen\r\nall along the railway lines, and if you will keep looking out of the\r\ncar window you will see at every crossing a woman with a flag in her\r\nhand standing at attention, like a soldier on guard duty, as the train\r\nrushes by.\r\n\r\nThe government owns and operates the railway, and, although the running\r\ntime is very slow, not more than fifteen or eighteen miles an hour,\r\nthe management is admirable, and there are some excellent features\r\nwhich might be imitated with profit by the railway companies in the\r\nUnited States. For example, at every railway station on the platform,\r\nis a big wooden tank of cool water with plenty of dippers. Beside it\r\nis a similar tank of hot water, so that the passengers, who expect it,\r\nbring their teapots along with them. When the train stops, those in\r\nthe third-class cars rush out for hot water and then go back to their\r\nplaces and enjoy a cup of home-made tea.\r\n\r\nTrains of tank cars stand on every side track, and we seemed to pass\r\none every few minutes, which is natural, because crude and refined\r\npetroleum is the principal freight hauled over the Caucasus from the\r\noil wells at Baku to Batoum, the principal shipping port on the Black\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nSleeping cars are free--at least every first-class railway carriage is\r\narranged in compartments, so that the back of the seat can be lifted to\r\nmake an upper berth, which is quite as comfortable as those in American\r\nPullmans, but passengers have to carry bedding with them, sheets and\r\npillows and blankets, and make up their own bunks when it comes time to\r\nretire. There is either a dining-car or a buffet on every train, from\r\nwhich coffee, tea, eggs, cold meats, bread and butter are served, so\r\nthat a journey is made very comfortable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Temple of the Fire Worshippers near Baku]\r\n\r\nWhen we went to bed, a few hours after leaving Tiflis, we were passing\r\nthrough a beautiful and highly cultivated agricultural country. When\r\nwe awoke in the morning, we were in a desert and everything smelled\r\nof oil. The first thing I saw, looking out of the car window, was a\r\nlong caravan of camels loaded with cans of refined petroleum, plodding\r\nthrough the sands on the shores of the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nThe surroundings are forbidding. The Caspian Sea is not an attractive\r\nbody of water. Its shores are as barren as a granite bowlder. There\r\nis no fresh water either above or below the surface of the ground\r\nanywhere around the coast, and the inhabitants are required to bring\r\ntheir supply in pipes for a long distance or else condense sea water.\r\nAt every port is a floating condenser, some worn out steamer or sailing\r\nvessel which has served its time carrying cargoes and is now anchored\r\nat a convenient place off the shore and filled with machinery for\r\ntransforming salt water into fresh. Sometimes the product is carried\r\nashore by pipes, but usually in large tank barges, and then peddled\r\naround the streets like milk in our cities, from house to house.\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of Baku remind me of the nitrate towns on the coast\r\nof Chile, which are also waterless; but it is much larger and more\r\nfinely built than any of them. There is already a population of 130,000\r\nor more at Baku, and the boosters are boasting of an expected 200,000\r\nat the end of this decade. There is no doubt that Baku is growing\r\nvery fast in people and in wealth, although the oil industry is not\r\nprosperous. The Standard Oil Company of the United States is driving\r\nRussian oil out of every country except Russia and its provinces.\r\nThere are many evidences of wealth in Baku; many fine business blocks\r\nand residences, churches and school-houses, shops and restaurants,\r\nand, indeed, it is quite as up-to-date as any city in the East. The\r\nlarge wholesale houses indicate an extensive trade, and its merchants\r\npractically control the markets of Central Asia.\r\n\r\nThe activity upon the docks indicates that there must be a large\r\ncommerce on the Caspian. The quays along the seashore in front of the\r\ncity for a mile or more are occupied by steamers and sailing vessels\r\ndischarging and receiving cargoes, which lie in great stacks upon the\r\nwharves. Long processions of carts and wagons are constantly coming\r\nand going between the docks and the railway stations. Nearly all the\r\ncommerce of Central Asia is handled there and it is brought or carried\r\naway by the two railways, one running to Batoum and the other to Odessa\r\nand Moscow.\r\n\r\nBaku is an ancient Persian city and belongs to Russia by conquest. A\r\nmajority of the inhabitants are still Persians, who furnish the manual\r\nlabor; the next largest racial division are Armenians, who keep the\r\nsmall shops, and many of the larger ones, for that matter, and compose\r\nthe mercantile class. And then come the Tartars, who are third in\r\nnumbers and there, as everywhere else, are the disorderly element.\r\n\r\nThe old city is a typical Persian town, half surrounded by a wall built\r\nin the twelfth century, with monumental towers and gates, several of\r\nwhich have been preserved. The followers of Zoroaster came here in\r\nearly times, attracted by the burning springs of naphtha, and built\r\ntemples for fire worship at intervals along the coast. The Parsees of\r\nBombay, descendants of fire worshippers who were driven from Persia\r\nby Mohammedan mobs, formerly kept up a perpetual fire upon an altar\r\nnear the city, but it was extinguished several years ago, and an oil\r\nrefinery now stands upon the spot.\r\n\r\nWe had rather an exciting experience trying to find one of the old\r\ntemples of the fire worshippers. We hunted around the old Persian\r\ntown until we discovered a man who knew where it was, and he sent two\r\nsmall boys to show us the way. Following them through a labyrinth\r\nof narrow streets, we came to a small block of land enclosed with a\r\nhigh stone wall and guarded by soldiers, who drove us off. When we\r\ntried to look through the cracks in the gates to get a glimpse of the\r\nbuildings inside, they pointed their rifles at us and were dangerously\r\ndemonstrative. We did not imagine that we were doing anything wrong.\r\nOur motives were as innocent as those of a Sunday-school teacher, but\r\nthe guard evidently suspected that we were up to some kind of mischief,\r\nand finally threatened us with instant death unless we left the place.\r\n\r\nAt that critical moment a polite citizen came along, who remonstrated\r\nwith the belligerent guard. He explained to us that the ancient temple\r\nwas now used as a magazine for ammunition and had to be closely guarded\r\nbecause of the energy of anarchists and revolutionists in the city.\r\n\r\nThere is a Byzantine fortress 800 years old, and an imposing tower\r\n180 feet high and 84 feet in diameter. It is circular in form, with\r\nan oblong extension, and built of regular courses of cut stone,\r\nalternating out and in about four inches. There are four doors at the\r\nbase, but they are all sealed up except one. They call it the Kiskala,\r\nwhich in Persian means the Tower of the Virgin, and several romantic\r\nstories are told about its origin, but we finally discovered that it\r\nwas built for a prison by the early Persians and is now used by the\r\nRussians for the storage of military supplies.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, for thousands of years--no one knows how long--the\r\nPersians used to come up to the shore of the Caspian Sea, where the\r\ncity of Baku now stands, and scrape from the ground the seepage from\r\nthe springs of oil that were found near the water. They used these\r\nscrapings for lubricating purposes, for fuel, for light, for healing\r\nwounds, and for various other useful purposes, and exercised much\r\ningenuity in cleansing and applying them.\r\n\r\nAt some remote date--it may have been as far back as the time of Daniel\r\nthe Prophet--the fire worshippers, the followers of Zoroaster, found\r\nhere several oil springs on fire. The naphtha must have caught fire by\r\naccident, but they considered it a miracle, and through many centuries\r\nmade pilgrimages to worship and adore the flames. Ultimately they built\r\na temple, a square structure of brick with a dome and four chimneys,\r\nthrough which, in some ingenious manner, they conducted the natural gas\r\nwhich exhales from the naphtha springs, and thus were able to maintain\r\nfour bright flames. The temple was in the centre of a large courtyard,\r\ninclosed by a high wall, in which were rooms for the accommodation of\r\npilgrims. The gateway was monumental and above it rose a square tower\r\nabout fifty feet in height, at the four corners of which were chimneys\r\nthrough which the gas was conducted in the same manner as at the temple\r\nwithin the inclosure, and the light could be seen for many miles in\r\nevery direction. They called it “The Shrine of Grace.”\r\n\r\nZoroaster, founder of the fire worshippers, lived in Persia before the\r\ntime of Cyrus the Great, and about six hundred years before Christ. He\r\ntaught the existence of a Supreme Being who created two other mighty\r\nbeings and imparted to them as much of his own nature as seemed good\r\nto him. One of them, Ormuzd, remained faithful and was regarded as\r\nthe source of all good, while Ahriman rebelled, and became the author\r\nof all the evil upon the earth. The religious rites of the fire\r\nworshippers were exceedingly simple. They adored fire, light, and the\r\nsun as the emblems of Ormuzd, the source of all light and purity,\r\nand performed their worship on the tops of mountains, having neither\r\ntemples, nor altars, nor images. Their priests were called Magi, whose\r\nlearning was so celebrated that their name has been applied since to\r\nastrologers, prophets, necromancers, and all orders of magicians and\r\nenchanters.\r\n\r\nThe religion of Zoroaster continued to flourish after the introduction\r\nof Christianity and in the third century was the dominant faith in\r\nthe East until the conquest of Persia by the Mohammedans in the\r\nseventh century compelled the greater number of the fire worshippers\r\nto renounce their faith. Those who refused fled to India, where they\r\nstill exist under the name of Parsees, which is derived from Pars, an\r\nancient name for Persia. At Bombay the Parsees are an enterprising,\r\nintelligent, and wealthy class of the population, and are distinguished\r\nfor their integrity and business ability. They have numerous temples in\r\nwhich they worship fire as the symbol of divinity.\r\n\r\nThis temple stood at the village of Sourakhany, about ten miles\r\nfrom Baku. The site is now owned by the Kokovev Oil Company. It was\r\nabandoned about 1880. For a century or two before that date pilgrims\r\ncame all the way from India, and the Parsee merchants of Bombay, famous\r\nfor their riches and enterprise, furnished the money to maintain the\r\nfire and entertain the pilgrims.\r\n\r\nWhy the temple was abandoned and the lights were allowed to go out\r\nI have not been able to ascertain. The only reasonable explanation\r\nis that after that part of the world was wrested from Persia by the\r\nRussians something must have happened, or some regulation may have\r\nbeen introduced, which made it difficult or impossible to continue\r\nthe ceremonials and maintain the pilgrimages. However that may have\r\nbeen, the form of worship and the nationality of the worshippers were\r\ngradually changed, until now Russians and Armenians adore the oil for\r\nthe money it brings instead of for its symbolic significance.\r\n\r\nThe development of the petroleum industry was very slow and began\r\nlate. The inhabitants of the old Persian city of Baku utilized the oil\r\nfor light and fuel gas undisturbed until 1856, when a Russian named\r\nKokreff and an Armenian named Mirsoeff obtained a concession from the\r\nRussian government to operate wells and refine the product. They had\r\na monopoly for twenty years, but did a very small business, producing\r\nan insignificant quantity and a poor quality of burning fluid compared\r\nwith the product of the present day.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the concession was revoked and there was a rush of prospectors\r\nand speculators to this territory. Everybody who could raise enough\r\nmoney to drive a well did so, until to-day, within a radius of ten\r\nmiles from the city of Baku, are 736 wells, producing more or less oil\r\nand belonging to almost as many people. The largest number are on a\r\npeninsula extending into the Caspian Sea, called Apocheron, between six\r\nand eight miles north of the city, with about one third as many at a\r\nplace called Bibbi-Eybat, about three miles south.\r\n\r\nThere are over a hundred independent companies, but only twenty-five\r\nare doing a refining business, and of these only eight have sufficient\r\ncapital to conduct their operations upon a paying basis. The large\r\ndistribution of the interests is, however, very demoralizing. It has\r\nbeen a bad thing for the town and the industry and for everybody\r\nconcerned, because whenever any large enterprise was undertaken,\r\ncut-throat competition has been used to interrupt and embarrass it.\r\nAs one gentleman expressed it, it would have been to the advantage of\r\neverybody concerned if half the oil that has been produced at Baku had\r\nbeen allowed to run into the sea.\r\n\r\nThere are three large companies, the largest one belonging to the\r\nfamily of the late Alfred Nobel, the Swedish philanthropist, who\r\nfounded the Nobel Institute at Stockholm and endowed it with funds from\r\nwhich the prizes for the promotion of peace, science, and literature\r\nare annually paid. Colonel Roosevelt, you will remember, went to\r\nChristiania in May, 1910, to receive the Nobel prize for peace which\r\nwas awarded him because of his success in conciliating Russia and Japan\r\nand putting an end to the recent war.\r\n\r\nAlfred Nobel, himself, was largely interested in the development of\r\nthe Baku oil industry at the beginning, but, about the year 1877, he\r\nwithdrew, and his brothers, Ludwig and Robert Nobel, continued the\r\nwork. They turned their holdings over to a stock company many years\r\nago, and Emmanuel Nobel, a son of Ludwig, now holds the controlling\r\ninterest in the company. He is the Rockefeller of Russian petroleum and\r\nis estimated to be worth $60,000,000. Although a Swede by birth and\r\nancestry, he is a Russian subject, maintains a splendid palace in St.\r\nPetersburg and has a villa with a large park in the Crimea, where he\r\ngoes for the summer.\r\n\r\nThe next richest man is an Armenian named Mantashoff, who still lives\r\nin Baku and looks after his interests. There is also a Tartar gentleman\r\nwho has made millions in the oil fields and is spending a part of his\r\nincome in the erection of a splendid building for a college in the city\r\nof Baku. The institution will be provided with an endowment sufficient\r\nto maintain a competent faculty and pay for the free education of a\r\ncertain number of young men of Tartar families forever. It will be\r\naltogether the most imposing building in Baku when it is finished, and\r\nit stands upon the principal street.\r\n\r\nThe second largest company is controlled by a French syndicate\r\norganized by the Rothschilds twenty-two years ago, and the third\r\nin importance is owned by local Armenians. These three companies\r\npractically control the refining industry, which is very large,\r\nconsidering the area of the oil fields, much larger than in any part of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nBaku produces more oil than any other single field. Last year (1909),\r\nits total product was 55,863,504 barrels, and Groznyi, the neighbouring\r\ndistrict, produced 6,249,627 barrels, making the total from the Caspian\r\n62,113,131 barrels, as compared with 179,562,479 barrels produced in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Domes of the Persian section of Baku]\r\n\r\nAustria is the second producer of the countries in Europe and\r\nreports 12,612,295 barrels for 1908; Roumania comes next, with\r\n8,252,157 barrels, and Germany, 1,009,278 barrels.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures, you will see that the industry at Baku is very\r\nimportant, and the Russian government derives a revenue of between\r\n$60,000,000 and $75,000,000 a year by taxing it. There is a direct\r\ntax upon the producers, an additional tax of thirty cents upon every\r\npood, which is eight gallons, produced, beside the income from the\r\nsale of stamps required on contracts, bills of lading, and all other\r\ncommercial paper. The little city of Baku, with 130,000 inhabitants,\r\nand they mostly Persians, Armenians, and Tartars, is the fourth source\r\nof revenue for the Russian treasury.\r\n\r\nMost of the refineries, especially those of the Nobel and French\r\ncompanies, are located at what is called in Russian, Tchorny Gorod,\r\nor the “Dark City,” which is connected with Baku by street car lines.\r\nThe Nobel Company has provided homes for its officers and employés at\r\nthe “White City,” a mile or two away--Biely Gorod, as it is called in\r\nRussian.\r\n\r\nThe Dark City consists of a large number of refineries, surrounded by\r\nhigh railway tracks, mostly covered with tank cars, and the gutters\r\non both sides are filled with a network of pipes tapping a myriad of\r\ntanks and conducting the oil between the wells and the refineries\r\nand the reservoirs where it is stored for shipment. The Dark City is\r\nlocated upon the shore of the Caspian Sea, where extensive docks have\r\nbeen built and pumps provided for filling tank boats, which carry oil\r\nup the Volga River into the interior of Russia as far as Moscow, via\r\nAstrakhan, where it flows into the Caspian.\r\n\r\nMr. Norman, an English engineer, who formerly lived in Chicago, and\r\nspent several years in the employ of the Standard Oil Company, showed\r\nme around the Nobel refineries and told me an interesting story of the\r\ndevelopment of the industry here.\r\n\r\n“Naphtha Springs, as they were called, have been known here for ages,”\r\nsaid Mr. Norman. “The fire worshippers came a thousand miles for\r\nthousands of years to worship them until the Russians conquered the\r\nterritory. In the ’50s a steamship company on the Caspian Sea undertook\r\nto collect oil by scraping the surface of the ground, and they carried\r\nit to other ports. It was also shipped into the interior by camel\r\ncaravans. Then two gentlemen, a Russian and an Armenian, obtained a\r\nconcession to work the deposit, and had a monopoly until 1876, when the\r\nNobel Brothers of Sweden--Alfred, Ludwig, and Robert--came down, put\r\ntheir brains to work, built refineries, and have been here ever since.\r\nThey now practically control the industry, employing about 10,000\r\npeople and have refineries and machine shops covering an area of one\r\nand a half square miles.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Arthur Lessner, also a Swede, is general manager. The company is\r\na stock concern, organized under the Russian laws, and its shares are\r\ndealt regularly in on all the stock exchanges of Europe.\r\n\r\n“The specific gravity of the Baku oil is much higher than that of the\r\nAmerican oil,” continued Mr. Norman. “It has a naphtha basis, while\r\nthe American oil has a paraffine basis. This oil is more like that of\r\nCalifornia. It is better for fuel than for illuminating purposes and is\r\nused for steaming on the railways and steamships in this part of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n“The distinctive feature of the Nobel refineries is a continuous\r\nsystem of distillation; that is, a series of stills from which the\r\nvarious properties of the oil are extracted as the crude raw material\r\nis passed from one to another, each having a higher temperature than\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n“There are eighteen pipe lines between the wells and the works,” said\r\nMr. Norman, “which were built by the Nobels about thirty years ago.\r\nUntil then the oil was carried on the backs of camels and in carts.\r\nThe common labour is performed by Persians, who are paid from thirty\r\nto thirty-five cents a day (American money), and the skilled labour is\r\nArmenian, which is paid from sixty to seventy-five cents a day. The\r\nNobel Company has provided neat and comfortable tenement houses for its\r\nemployés at the White City, with clubhouses, hospitals and other humane\r\nprovisions.”\r\n\r\nMr. Norman says the industry is not prosperous; that the Standard Oil\r\nCompany is driving the Baku product out of Europe and that Russia is\r\nnow practically the only market the Baku manufacturers are able to\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nA new oil field has been found within the last year or so near the\r\ntown of Maikop, in the northern foothills of the Caucasus range of\r\nmountains, and there has been a good deal of excitement in consequence.\r\nVery little is known about conditions there, however, and the condition\r\nof the market, because of the aggressive policy of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany, is not encouraging for its developement. The Standard Company,\r\neverybody admits, can produce a better quality of refined petroleum as\r\nwell as lubricating oil and other by-products, and sell them at a less\r\nprice in every market in the world, except the Russian Empire, which is\r\nprotected by a prohibitory tariff, than the Baku refiners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDAGHESTAN, AND ITS ANCIENT PEOPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nDaghestan is a province of Russia which lies immediately north of the\r\nCaucasus Mountains, and for 300 miles or more along the west shore of\r\nthe Caspian Sea. It is the tip end of Europe. The Caucasus range is the\r\nboundary between the two continents, and beyond it is the hinterland.\r\nIt is the wall of separation between the Christian and the Mohammedan\r\nworlds. Daghestan is also the limit of the region of natural moisture.\r\nIt is a well-watered country, with hundreds of rivers and creeks, which\r\nrise in the snow-clad mountains and flow into the Caspian. Beyond\r\nDaghestan it is necessary to irrigate the soil by artificial means\r\nto raise any kind of crops. West of Daghestan are forests, fields of\r\nclover and grain, and pastures that are always green. East of its\r\nboundaries lies a desert which stretches for thousands of miles across\r\nthe parched areas of Asia. There is no green thing of natural growth\r\nuntil the borders of China are reached.\r\n\r\nDaghestan has always been the prey of rival powers. It has been\r\nplundered and ravaged in turn by all the Asiatic hordes. Its soil has\r\nbeen fertilized by the blood of Persians, Greeks, Romans, Goths, Huns,\r\nAvars, Slavs, Mongols, Tartars, Turks. The “Golden Horde” swept over it\r\nonce and again in the great tidal wave of war that lit up the two\r\ncontinents during the Middle Ages. It has been a battle-ground for\r\ntwenty centuries, and the war-chargers of fifty armies have fattened\r\nupon its pastures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prince Schamyl “The Lion of Daghestan,” and his sons]\r\n\r\nThe most important river in Daghestan is the Terek, which is fed by a\r\nglacier on the slopes of that mystic mountain called Kasbek--16,546\r\nfeet in height--to which Prometheus was chained. None of the rivers in\r\nDaghestan are navigable, but an almost incredible amount of water power\r\nis going to waste for the lack of mechanical interest and ingenuity.\r\nThe inhabitants are farmers and herdsmen; they plow their fields and\r\nreap their harvests and follow their flocks and herds with skill and\r\ndiligence, but a Tartar never learns a trade. Agriculture is too\r\nprofitable and permits too much leisure for enjoyment, to be exchanged\r\nfor any other occupation by those pleasure-loving people. They work\r\non their farms and in their orchards from the first of May to the\r\nfirst of September. During that period the custom of centuries forbids\r\nfestivities, but after the crops are in, and the cattle and sheep\r\nhave been brought down from the mountains into the plains, the Tartar\r\npopulation give themselves up to their native diversions for the rest\r\nof the year. They are a hospitable people, and whoever breaks bread\r\nor eats salt with them is protected and defended with their lives. A\r\nTartar farmhouse is a hotel for travellers--a free house of call for\r\nthe homeless. No hungry man was ever sent from a Tartar threshold, the\r\nexercise of hospitality being the most important article in their creed.\r\n\r\nThe women spend their lives at the looms and work up the wool from\r\nthe flocks into marketable products--rugs, saddle-bags, blankets, and\r\nother coarse fabrics, which are admired for their design and finish.\r\nThe rugs of Daghestan are found on the floors of every city in the\r\nworld, and, while they do not compare with those from Persia or Bokhara\r\nand are graded as medium in value, they last forever. The people were\r\nformerly all Mohammedans, and all the Tartars are still--but the\r\nshifting tides of humanity have left adherents of all creeds, and a\r\nmajority of the present inhabitants profess the faith of the orthodox\r\nGreek church and are under the spiritual jurisdiction of the patriarch\r\nat St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThere is a railway from Baku to Moscow, and through sleeping cars. The\r\ntrack hugs the shore of the Caspian Sea for more than a hundred miles,\r\npassing first through a flat, desolate desert, broken by many rocks\r\nof slate and mounds of sun-burned clay. But after several streams are\r\ncrossed, mountains appear in the distance and the soil, as well as\r\nthe climate, improves. The dryness of the desert is moistened by damp\r\nbreezes that blow down from the Caucasus and bring life to the earth.\r\nIt was a relief to see green meadows and pastures and verdure-covered\r\nhills, after our long sojourn among the barren wastes of Turkestan. The\r\nmeadows were gay in their summer raiment. Wild flowers were fashionable\r\nthat year, and the steppes of Daghestan were strewn with them, an\r\nalmost infinite variety of colours.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the steppes of Daghestan resembles the steppes of\r\nNorth Dakota after harvest time. The surface of the earth undulates\r\nin great waves and ridges. Americans would call it a rolling prairie.\r\nThe slopes that face the sun are yellow with the stubble of the grain\r\nthat has been harvested. Vast herds of cattle and sheep are grazing\r\non the northern slopes of the hills, and the absence of fences makes\r\nnecessary the employment of shepherds, who wear long, greasy looking\r\ncoats of sheepskin, with the wool inside. Their heads are covered with\r\nbig shakos that look very heavy and very hot.\r\n\r\nAt night the sheep are herded in folds made of braided saplings which\r\nare planted and grown for that express purpose. A grove of elms or\r\nhickory or other flexible saplings can be planted at a slight expense,\r\nand when they are two or three years old they can be cut and braided\r\nlike basket work. The herdsmen make litters eight or ten feet long and\r\nfour or five feet wide, which, when supported by light posts, make a\r\nstrong and “hog-tight” fence. Every ranchman has one, and moves it from\r\npasture to pasture, following his flocks, and turns the sheep and lambs\r\ninto this movable corral every night.\r\n\r\nThe men we saw around the railway stations are Tartars, whose love of\r\nsociety and excitement brings upon them the contempt of the phlegmatic\r\nGermans and Russians, who scorn such diversions. Their love of dress\r\nalso excites the derision of their neighbours. They cling to the\r\nancient Georgian costume and will not give it up. They wear the\r\nkalak--a long coat with a plaited skirt--and a hood of white woolen\r\ncloth, called a kabula, over their heads, with a long end and tassels\r\nhanging down their back. It is much more graceful than the fez but is\r\nnot so dignified as the turban.\r\n\r\nThe Russian government is diverting immigrants to that section of the\r\nCaucasus from other parts of the empire. Although one of the oldest\r\ncommunities in the universe, it is still thinly settled. The revolution\r\nof the land-hungry peasants of European Russia in 1905 was followed\r\nby legislation in the duma similar to that of the British Parliament\r\nconcerning Ireland, and the great estates are being purchased by the\r\ngovernment, broken up into small farms and sold to the peasants on long\r\ntime at a low rate of interest. This movement was hastened and the land\r\nowners were persuaded to sell by arguments similar to those used by\r\nthe tenantry in Ireland. The landlords who still refuse to yield are\r\nhaving a hard time of it. Their barns are set on fire, their cattle are\r\nmutilated, their wheat fields are burned, and various other penalties\r\nare imposed upon them. There is now a law authorizing the compulsory\r\nexpropriation of large estates, and the lands belonging to the crown\r\nand the church are being divided and disposed of slowly among peasant\r\nfarmers imported from the more densely populated sections of central\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThere are many sturdy Germans there, descendants of immigrants who were\r\ninduced to go into the Caucasus by Catherine the Great one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five years ago. She gave them large grants of land and relieved\r\nthem from taxation and military service, as an inducement to develop\r\nthe natural wealth of her empire. By minding their own business they\r\nhave managed to get along with the fiery-hearted and hot-tempered\r\nTartars. The Germans make the best farmers and are the richest portion\r\nof the population. Armenians, Persians, and Greeks are the tradesmen\r\nand the same races furnish the mechanics and labourers. Representatives\r\nof all the races of central Asia are to be found there, and many of\r\nEuropean stock, Latins and Greeks, Huns, Iberians, and Italians,\r\nbecause when the tidal waves of humanity, to which I have already\r\nreferred, receded, a good deal of driftwood was always left behind.\r\n\r\nDaghestan has been known to history for three thousand years. Josephus\r\ntells us of a race called the Alans, who dwelt upon the coast of the\r\nCaspian Sea and along the northern slopes of the Caucasus, whence,\r\npassing through “Iron Gates,” they fell upon the Medes and nearly\r\nexterminated them. They invaded Armenia, eight hundred or nine hundred\r\nyears before Christ, and laid everything waste behind them. They\r\ncrossed over into Persia and made themselves at home in that country\r\nuntil they were driven out by Cyrus the Great. The “Iron Gates,” so\r\ncalled, were a part of a great wall, like that of the Chinese, which,\r\nin prehistoric times, extended from the present city of Derbent on\r\nthe shore of the Caspian Sea, to the mountain of Koushan-Dagh near\r\nthe western limits of Daghestan. This wall is believed by several\r\nauthorities to have been built a thousand years before the Christian\r\nera during the reign of a monarch called Nashrevan the Just, for the\r\nprotection of his people, who lived north of the Caucasus, against\r\nthe wild tribes of Asia. It was eighteen or twenty feet high and so\r\nthick that a squadron of cavalry could gallop along its top. Remnants\r\nare still preserved and the ruins of forty-three castles along its\r\nfoundation have been counted between the mountains and the sea. There\r\nwas only one passage, through the “Iron Gates” which remained in\r\nperfect preservation until the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nArabian writers in the early part of the Christian era refer to it\r\nfrequently as a gigantic work, and describe fortifications that were\r\nfilled with soldiers, and impregnable to attack. The total length of\r\nthe wall was two hundred and sixty-six miles so that the castles must\r\nhave been about six miles apart. You will remember that the Romans\r\nbuilt a similar wall across the north of England between Carlisle and\r\nNewcastle to keep the Highlanders out of Briton, and other defences of\r\nthe kind have been known elsewhere. Oriental writers say that the hour\r\nof prayer used to be communicated along this wall by the sentinels five\r\ntimes a day.\r\n\r\nOther writers attribute the construction of the wall and the gate to\r\nIskander, or Alexander the Great, who conquered this country and took\r\npossession of it. It was a very important part of his empire, and from\r\nthe mountains of Daghestan he drew the bravest and most efficient\r\nhorsemen in his armies. He called the people Khozars, and they were\r\npagans.\r\n\r\nProfessor A. V. Williams Jackson, of the chair of archæology of\r\nColumbia University, New York, has been engaged for several years in\r\nthe fascinating and important task of locating the trail traversed by\r\nAlexander the Great in his conquest of the world between 334 and 323\r\nB.C. He has been able to identify with reasonable certainty nearly all\r\nof the stages made by the great Macedonian in his pursuit of Darius\r\nIII, the last of the Achæmenian kings, the places at which he stopped\r\nduring his march, and the battle-fields upon which he fought. He is\r\nespecially gratified that he has been able to fix with certainty the\r\nlocation of the famous “Caspian Gates” beyond the city of Rai, which\r\nis ancient Rappa, where the mother of Zoroaster, the founder of the\r\nfire worshippers, was born, between five hundred and four hundred years\r\nbefore Christ.\r\n\r\nPhilip of Macedonia, as you will remember, fell by the hand of an\r\nassassin in the midst of his preparations for an invasion of the\r\nPersian empire in the year 336 B.C., and was succeeded by his son,\r\nAlexander, then a mere boy, twenty years old. He had not been on the\r\nthrone a year, notwithstanding his youth, before he was recognized as\r\na greater warrior and a more powerful sovereign than his father and\r\ncommanded the universal awe and admiration of the Greeks. At the head\r\nof an army of forty thousand cavalry, infantry, and archers, he started\r\neastward, on his world-conquering campaign, and fought his first great\r\nbattle, B.C. 334, in Asia Minor. He crossed the Taurus Mountains and\r\nsubdued Mesopotamia. Thence he marched southward and captured Damascus;\r\nbesieged Tyre successfully, passed through Jerusalem, paused to\r\noverthrow the fortress at Gaza, conquered Egypt, founded the city of\r\nAlexandria, which he called by his own name, and there made his first\r\nclaim to divinity. Having added all this territory to his empire, he\r\nreturned to Mesopotamia and occupied, one after the other, the capitals\r\nof Assyria, Persia, and Media, which were full of wealth and splendour.\r\nThe actual amount of gold and silver seized by him in these capitals is\r\nestimated at one hundred and fifty million dollars and the loot made\r\nevery soldier in his army rich.\r\n\r\nDarius the Great fled before him, and Alexander’s pursuit from\r\nEcbatana, the capital of Media, through the Parthian passes, is\r\nconsidered one of the most remarkable of all military campaigns. He\r\novertook the flying Persian as the latter was dying of wounds dealt\r\nhim by a traitor, Bessus, his satrap in Bacoria, in what is now called\r\nTurkestan. Bessus placed the wounded monarch in a covered chariot\r\nand set out to meet Alexander. But Darius refused to follow a band of\r\ntraitors, whereupon the conspirators, roused to fury, transfixed him\r\nwith their javelins and left him weltering in his blood. Alexander,\r\nwho came up only a few moments after Darius had expired, ordered the\r\nbody to be embalmed and buried with the honours of an emperor. He\r\ncaptured and executed Bessus, the regicide, and married the daughter\r\nof Darius, who had no other heir. Thus he assumed, so far as possible,\r\nthe character of Darius’s legitimate successor and proclaimed himself\r\nemperor of the East.\r\n\r\nHe then returned westward to subdue the Caucasus, and marched northward\r\nalong the western shore of the Caspian Sea to what was then considered\r\nthe limits of the world.\r\n\r\nProfessor Jackson believes that he then built the wall from the shores\r\nof the Caspian to the crags of the Caucasus Mountains, like the great\r\nwall of China, to hold back the wild tribes of Asia that roamed upon\r\nthe northern steppes, and the iron gates near the present city of\r\nDerbent.\r\n\r\nAfter reducing the Caucasus, Alexander invaded the Trans-Caspian\r\ncountry and marched east and south through Afghanistan, where he\r\nfounded a city said to be the modern Kandahar. Then he turned northward\r\nacross the Hindu-Kush Mountains and founded another colony, at what is\r\nnow Kabul. Then he kept on northward to Bokhara and Samarkand, where\r\nhe spent a year or more and built a splendid city which he called\r\nMarakanda.\r\n\r\nFrom there he set out to conquer India and conquered the desert on the\r\nway. In the spring of the year 323 B.C. he returned to Babylon, where\r\nhe was met by embassies from all the rulers of the civilized world.\r\nFresh troops had arrived from Greece for the campaign against India\r\nand the expedition was on the point of starting when Alexander was\r\nseized with fever and died in June, 323 B.C., at the age of thirty-two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of maps in ancient times and the frequent changes in\r\nnomenclature in the countries of the East has caused interminable\r\ncontroversies as to the route of the great Macedonian, and the identity\r\nof many of the places which are associated with his achievements. Dr.\r\nJackson, who has devoted his life to the study of Persian and Indian\r\nhistory, undertook to set things straight some years ago and has made\r\nseveral visits to Asia for that purpose. He is perhaps the highest\r\nauthority in America on Persian affairs and has recently published a\r\nbook of absorbing interest called “Persia, Past and Present.” A second\r\nbook will treat of the Trans-Caspian country and other scenes of the\r\nachievements of Alexander in that part of the world.\r\n\r\nDr. Jackson tells me that he feels confident that he has established\r\nthe fact that Alexander built the wall between the Caspian Sea and\r\nthe Caucasus Mountains. He has been convinced of this by certain\r\ninscriptions upon tablets attached to the wall, which attribute its\r\ncreation to the first world conqueror. And they confirm a belief which\r\nis always cherished. But in his investigations in Baku, the Caspian oil\r\ndistrict, he met with a surprise from which it is difficult to recover,\r\nconcerning the age of the ruins of a temple of the fire worshippers\r\na few miles from that city. It is supposed to have been erected in\r\nvery ancient times by pilgrims who were attracted to the banks of the\r\nCaspian because of the naphtha springs that were burning along its\r\nwestern coast. It is one of the most striking and interesting of all\r\nthe ruins in that country. Later comers supposed that these fires\r\nwere natural and were worshipped from the earliest times. They built\r\nan imposing temple around them and with great ingenuity conducted the\r\ngas through pipes of cane sheathed with clay to the tops of towers\r\nerected over the gates and at the corners of the enclosure. These fires\r\nwere kept up by Parsees from Bombay, descendants of the ancient fire\r\nworshippers of Persia, until early in the ’80s, when the owners of\r\na concession from the Russian government to develop the oil deposit\r\nseized the place and built a refinery.\r\n\r\nDr. Jackson says: “I always supposed that this fire temple was built\r\nby Zoroaster or some of his followers, and was very much shocked when\r\nI discovered that it is a modern institution; although I still cling\r\nto the belief that it may have been a place of worship for the Persian\r\nfire worshippers from the earliest times.\r\n\r\n“In a careful examination of the ruins of the temple at Surakhany,\r\nnear Baku, I found seventeen inscriptions, some of them in excellent\r\ncondition, and was able to make photographs of them all. Six of them\r\nare on the outside and fifteen on the inside of the walls, and they\r\nare all dated in the eighteenth century A.D., instead of the sixth or\r\neighth century B.C., as I have always supposed. There is no question\r\nabout it. The temple is not only modern, but it was built by Hindoo\r\nfire worshippers--Brahmins from the Punjab--survivors of the old\r\nVedic worship. They were probably Hindoo merchants at Baku and were\r\nreminded of the faith and the forms of worship of their ancestors by\r\nfinding these flaming springs. Furthermore, some of the inscriptions\r\ncorrespond very closely with those I have seen at Kanzra, in northern\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n“It has always been a mystery why there is no mention of this temple\r\nin ancient Greek and Roman accounts of the Caucasus and the Caspian\r\ncountry, which have frequent references to the burning springs of\r\nnaphtha. Nor do any of the early Mohammedan writers mention the temple.\r\nThe first we hear of it is about the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury in a narrative of a London merchant named Hanmay, who went\r\nover to that country on a trading expedition and wrote a book about\r\nthe Caspian Sea and the surrounding country. He describes the temple\r\nand the fires and gives some interesting information concerning both.\r\nGibbon in his history describes the temple and says it was destroyed by\r\nHeraclius, the Christian emperor of Byzantium, in the seventh century,\r\nbut that is not true.\r\n\r\n“I have been able to locate most of the places identified with the\r\ncampaigns of Alexander of Macedonia,” continued Professor Jackson, “and\r\nit has been an exceedingly interesting task.\r\n\r\n“I have been able to trace back the history of the city of Derbent for\r\nseveral hundred years before Christ. Notwithstanding its location on\r\nthe shores of the Caspian Sea, so far from what we generally assumed to\r\nhave been the scenes of human activity at that period, it has had an\r\nimportant and busy place in history, and is frequently referred to by\r\nwriters in ancient days. For example, Tacitus tells us that Alexander\r\nquartered his invalid soldiers there in 330 B.C.\r\n\r\n“I have not been able to decipher the inscriptions upon the tablets I\r\nfound in the temple of the fire worshippers at Surakhany. I cannot\r\nread the language in which they are written, and I don’t know anything\r\nabout them, but one of these days we hope to make them clear.”\r\n\r\nSeñor Don Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo, “chamberlain of the most high and\r\npuissant Lord Don Henry, third of that name, King of Castile and Leon,”\r\nwho visited the court of the great Tamerlane, the emperor of Asia,\r\nat Samarkand as an ambassador in 1403, refers to the iron gates in\r\nthe wall at Derbent. He speaks also of others in the mountains which\r\nseparate China and Turkestan, where, he says: “There is a pass leading\r\nup by a ravine which looks as if it had been artificially cut, and the\r\nhills rise to a great height on either side, and the pass is smooth\r\nand very deep. In the centre of the pass there is a village, and the\r\nmountain rises to a great height behind. This pass is called ‘the gates\r\nof iron,’ and in all the mountain range there is no other pass, so\r\nthat it guards the land of Samarkand in the direction of India. These\r\n‘gates of iron’ produce a large revenue to the lord Timour Beg, for all\r\nmerchants who come from India pass this way.\r\n\r\n“Timour Beg is also lord of the other ‘gates of iron,’ which are near\r\nDerbent, leading to the province of Tartary, in the city of Caffa,\r\nwhich are also in very lofty mountains, between Tartary and the land\r\nof Derbent, facing the Sea of Bakou, and the people of Tartary are\r\nobliged to use that pass when they go to Persia. The distance from the\r\n‘gates of iron’ at Derbent to those in the land of Samarkand is fifteen\r\nhundred leagues.\r\n\r\n“Say if a great lord, who is master of these ‘gates of iron,’ and of\r\nall the land that is between them, such as Timour Beg, is not a mighty\r\nprince! Derbent is a very large city, with a large territory. They\r\ncall the ‘gates of iron’ by the names of Derbent and Termit. At this\r\nhouse they made the ambassadors a present of a horse, and the horses of\r\nthis country are much praised for their great spirit. These mountains\r\nof the ‘gates of iron’ are without woods, and in former times they say\r\nthat there were gates covered with iron placed across the pass, so that\r\nno one could pass without an order.”\r\n\r\nDaghestan was the most costly province ever added to the Russian\r\nEmpire. It cost thirty-five years of war and the sacrifice of 200,000\r\nsoldiers to subdue the fierce mountain warriors, the Lesghians, the\r\nTeherkess and the other tribes, who were the fiercest fighters in\r\nEurope, and are said to be the descendants of the Hittites of the Old\r\nTestament. They were pagans until Mohammed appeared. Since then they\r\nhave been fanatical in their adherence to Islam. They were taught\r\nthe art of war by the savage Scythians in prehistoric times, and the\r\naboriginal tribes were amalgamated in the Middle Ages with the Golden\r\nHorde of Kirghiz from the desert of Khiva, which swept through eastern\r\nEurope like a cyclone. Many of those desert warriors settled here,\r\nand from them descended the hardy, fearless, uncompromising race who\r\ncontinued to fight for their independence long after Georgia and the\r\nCircassians had acknowledged the sovereignty of the czar. Fifty years\r\nago Daghestan was called “the graveyard of the Russian army.”\r\n\r\nThrough the gorges of the Caucasus for more than a generation the\r\nablest generals in Russian history, including three czars--Nicholas,\r\nthe iron czar, and the Alexanders I and II--fought in vain to subdue\r\nthose fearless people, who, with one man to their forty, defeated\r\nthem often in open fights as well as in ambush among the impregnable\r\nfortresses of nature. Not until the resources of the country were\r\nexhausted and nearly all the towns and cities were laid waste and the\r\npopulation of fighting men was almost exterminated did they yield.\r\nFinally, when further resistance was impossible, Prince Schamyl,\r\nprophet, priest, astrologer, and necromancer, the hereditary sultan\r\nof those Tartar tribes, laid his gory scimitar at the feet of General\r\nBaryantinsky and took an oath of allegiance to Alexander II. The lord\r\nof the Caucasus, the lion of Daghestan, as the old warrior was called,\r\nwas permitted to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he died of a broken\r\nheart beside the tomb of the Prophet and was buried in the sacred city.\r\nAfter the surrender his warriors settled down on farms and ranches and\r\nhave been blessed with great prosperity, although they are restless\r\nof disposition and have made an occasional display of temper and\r\ndissatisfaction that has called for discipline.\r\n\r\nThe men of Daghestan are irrepressible fighters. They inherited their\r\nwarlike habits, and are never so happy and never so contented as when\r\nthey are engaged in a desperate campaign. During the war of 1877–8\r\nbetween Turkey and Russia many of the more fanatical Mohammedans\r\ncrossed over into Asia Minor and joined the army of the sultan because\r\nthey recognized him as the Padishah of Islam and the lineal successor\r\nof the Prophet. But after peace was arranged most of them came back\r\nto their homes, and Gen. Loris Melikoff, one of the few Armenians who\r\nhave risen to military distinction and received honours in the Russian\r\nservice, became their governor.\r\n\r\nMelikoff is a remarkable man. He conducted the campaign against Turkey\r\neast of the Black Sea under the nominal supervision of the Grand Duke\r\nMichael, brother of the czar, was made an aide-de-camp to the emperor,\r\nand at nine and twenty was commander-in-chief of the Caucasus. As a\r\nrule, Armenians do not make good soldiers. They are merchants instead\r\nof military men, but Melikoff ranks as one of the most brilliant and\r\nsuccessful commanders of the Russian army.\r\n\r\nThe first and only important city on the railroad between Baku and\r\nVladikavkas is Derbent, a market for the produce of a large area of\r\nwell cultivated fields, for the wool of a thousand flocks, and the\r\nhides of a thousand herds. A good deal of timber from the forests of\r\nthe Caucasus is shipped across the Caspian from there also and goes to\r\nTurkestan. Most of the freight is loaded upon barges, towed over to\r\nAstrakhan, and thence up the Volga River to Moscow, Kavan, and other\r\nmanufacturing centres.\r\n\r\nDerbent is one of the most ancient cities in Europe. It is situated\r\non the western coast of the Caspian, and has about forty thousand\r\ninhabitants, who are a mixture of all bloods and races and clans. It\r\nis supposed to have been founded in prehistoric times by a race known\r\nas the Aylans, from which the German people sprang. It was besieged\r\nby Alexander of Macedon, by Cyrus the Great, emperor of the Medes\r\nand Persians. All of the great warriors of ancient history have sat\r\nbefore its walls, recognizing the strategic value of its position and\r\nthe importance of placing a shield before the approaches to Persia,\r\nArmenia, and Kurdistan, which have been the prey of every ambitious\r\nempire-builder since the time of Christ.\r\n\r\nAnother city of lesser importance is Petrosky, comparatively modern,\r\nwithout much history, but, nevertheless, a busy shipping port for\r\ngrain. The small steamers that ply the Caspian are continually going in\r\nand coming out as they find their way between Petrosky and the other\r\nCaspian ports. Much grain is grown upon the steppes of Daghestan, and\r\nthe larger part of it is transported to Astrakhan, to be ground into\r\nflour to feed the people of Moscow and Petersburg. At Astrakhan, the\r\nmouth of the Volga, all freight brought by steamer is transferred to\r\nbarges, which ply that great river far to the northward.\r\n\r\nWhen the train leaves Petrosky it starts directly westward toward\r\nthe mountains, and is welcomed by a row of glorious peaks which rise\r\nsnow-clad toward the heavens. The highest peak in the southern part\r\nof the range is called Bazar-Duez, and measures 14,723 feet; the\r\nnext highest are Shah-Dagh, 13,951 feet; Kourousch, 13,750 feet;\r\nDoulty-Dagh, 13,425 feet; Kontana-Dagh, 11,425 feet; Goudour-Dagh,\r\n11,075 feet; and a dozen more of ten thousand feet and less. They are\r\nfull of romance as well as history. Daghestan has been the scene of\r\nvery important events, but during the last four or five centuries,\r\nsince America was discovered and the development of European\r\ncivilization has required so much attention, it has been overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe original of the tragedy of Mazeppa, Byron’s hero, was Ivan\r\nStephanovich, the son of a Tcherkess prince, and was born in 1644.\r\nWhile a page at the court of one of the petty principalities of Russia,\r\na nobleman discovered that his wife was in love with the handsome\r\nyoung mountaineer, and with the cruelty characteristic of the Tartar\r\nrace, caused the boy to be stripped naked and bound upon the back of\r\na wild horse, which was turned loose upon the steppes. After days of\r\nwandering without food Ivan was carried unconscious into a Cossack\r\ncamp and after a time became secretary to the hetman or chief. His\r\ninfluence grew until, in 1687, he was elected chieftain. He won the\r\nadmiration of Peter the Great, who bestowed upon him the title of\r\nPrince of the Ukrain, but a few years after, when Peter revoked some\r\nof the ancient privileges and liberties of the Cossacks, he organized\r\na rebellion against his patron. Before he had a chance to make a\r\npublic demonstration the conspiracy was discovered, and Mazeppa fled\r\nfor protection to the court of Charles XII of Sweden. Being unable to\r\ncapture the rebel, Peter the Great ordered his effigy to be hanged upon\r\na gallows before the palace, and his capital, Baturin, was sacked and\r\nburned and razed to the ground. Mazeppa’s romantic career furnished the\r\nplot for several novels and dramatic works in addition to Byron’s poem,\r\nand suggested a theme for several famous paintings.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be something in the atmosphere of the Caucasus to\r\naddle religious ideas and inspire queer interpretations of the Bible.\r\nA majority of the population were formerly Mohammedans, but large\r\nnumbers have been converted to the Russian church, although an active\r\npropaganda is not permitted by the government. There are about 500,000\r\nProtestants from Wurtemberg and other German states, who were induced\r\nto settle there during the reign of Catherine II. They hold fast to\r\ntheir faith, and have built a Lutheran church in almost every town,\r\nwhere the herr pastor supplements his scanty salary by farming or fruit\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\nOne of the queerest sects of dissenters, which has sloughed off\r\nthe orthodox Greek organization, is called “Sgrannyky,” which means\r\n“wanderers.” They have no homes nor houses of worship; no priests\r\nor organizations. Their preachers are elected from among the most\r\nintelligent members of the community, who preach, baptize, perform\r\nfuneral obsequies, expound the Scriptures to inquirers, and often teach\r\nin the parochial schools.\r\n\r\nThe “wanderers” claim to be the only true and literal followers of\r\nChrist. They have “given up everything,” as He commanded. They denounce\r\nthe Russian Church for having corrupted the simplicity of the original\r\nfaith. They condemn the splendid ritual and ostentatious forms of\r\nworship in temples which cost millions of rubles for unnecessary\r\narchitecture and ornaments and vestments, which should be sold and the\r\nproceeds given to the poor.\r\n\r\nThe “wanderers” hold their services in the open air, like the Druids,\r\nand the “Bush-Baptists” of our own Southern states, because Christ\r\nnever preached under a roof or in a temple made with human hands. They\r\nabstain from the exercise of the privileges and rights of citizenship;\r\nthey refuse to pay taxes because a portion of the revenue of the\r\nRussian government is devoted to the support of the church; they avoid\r\nbeing counted in the census, because they do not acknowledge the\r\nsovereignty of the czar; and refuse to sign or accept written contracts\r\nor agreements of any kind, because they regard writing as an invention\r\nof the devil.\r\n\r\nAnother queer sect are called Hlistys or “People of God,” who practice\r\na life of absolute chastity, mutilate their bodies, inflict torture\r\nupon themselves, refuse to accept any compensation but food for their\r\nlabour, renounce all luxuries and comforts, and believe that by so\r\ndoing they purify their spirits and become perfect in holiness.\r\n\r\nAnother and similar sect style themselves the Stundists, or “Brethren\r\nin Friendship with God.” They adhere to a strict interpretation of the\r\nBible, live simple lives, renounce wealth, give all they have to the\r\npoor, condemn the institutions and ceremonies of the Russian church,\r\nand are intolerant toward people who do not agree with them.\r\n\r\nThe “Old Believers,” or Douhobortsy sect, many of whom have emigrated\r\nto Canada, are quite numerous down there, and are among the most\r\nprosperous and successful of the farmers. They were banished from\r\nnorthern Russia to the Caucasus during the reign of Alexander I, and\r\nforcibly deported by the government at the instigation of the holy\r\nsynod. They are, however, honest, industrious, law-abiding farmers,\r\nwho educate their children with great care, practise all the virtues\r\nwe commend, and are at fault only in some odd practices and queer\r\nmanifestations of spirituality which are not conventional.\r\n\r\nWe awakened in the morning in the midst of a wide prairie which\r\nreminded us more than ever of North Dakota, and we saw what looked like\r\nAmerican reapers in the fields and heard their music above the noise\r\nof the train. Much of the harvest work was being done by women, which\r\nisn’t the Dakota way, but the men are in the army and somebody must\r\nreap the grain. Another thing equally unlike North Dakota is that the\r\nconductor and porter of the train wear big revolvers at their belts,\r\none on either side, which look like business, and suspended from their\r\nbelts behind them are round leather scabbards, like cylinders, into\r\nwhich something is thrust that looks like a policeman’s club. We\r\ndiscovered afterward that they are signal flags, tightly rolled and\r\nalways within reach.\r\n\r\nThe train turned westward later in the day to run for many miles along\r\nthe foot of the mountains, and at a handsome stone station that might\r\neasily be mistaken for an armoury, we changed to a branch line for the\r\ncity of Vladikavkas and the famous Dariel Pass, one of the only two\r\npathways through the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nVladikavkas is a typical Russian city, founded in 1775 by Prince\r\nPotemkin by direction of Catherine the Great, upon the site of a native\r\nvillage called Kapoukaya, which means “the gate of the gorge.” At that\r\ntime it was of considerable importance to the Russians as a post of\r\ndefence against the rebellious mountain tribes, and it has grown into\r\na busy, bustling, commercial city, with a rich agricultural territory\r\nto support it, and is a depot of military supplies for the entire\r\nCaucasus. The name is spelled several ways--Valdicaucasus, Viadicaukus,\r\nand otherwise, according to the nationality of the speller--but each\r\nof the versions has the same meaning, and that is “the master of the\r\nCaucasus,” for its garrisons command and protect the Dariel Pass and\r\nthe military road which was built through its gorges to Tiflis by the\r\nRussians half a century ago. Considered from a military standpoint,\r\nthere is no more important highway in the world, and when the next war\r\nbetween Russia and Turkey occurs within the next ten years, a continual\r\nprocession of troops and wagons loaded with ammunition and military\r\nsupplies will be passing down to Armenia and Asia Minor through its\r\nnarrow defiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: City Hall of Vladicaucasus]\r\n\r\nVladikavkas has fine, broad streets, which, however, are either very\r\ndusty or very muddy at all times. They are laid out at right angles\r\nand planted with poplars; and the main street, which is a hundred and\r\nsixty feet wide, has a promenade in the centre for the entire distance,\r\nshaded by two rows of trees on both sides and watered by dashing\r\nstreams that flow through the gutters. Booths for the sale of tea and\r\nbeer, catch-penny shows, seats for the weary, band stands and kiosks\r\noccur at frequent intervals, and in the long twilight of the summer\r\nevenings all the people of the town come out to promenade up and down\r\nthis pleasant way, to listen to the military bands, to greet each other\r\nand gossip, and to learn what is going on in their little world.\r\n\r\nAn electric car line reaches every corner of the city, which is a great\r\nconvenience because, like all provincial towns in Russia, Vladikavkas\r\ncovers an enormous area. The houses are chiefly of a single story,\r\nbuilt of stone around a courtyard, and occupy large spaces. The shops\r\nare filled with attractive stocks of merchandise, and there are several\r\nlarge warehouses in which all kinds of agricultural machinery is\r\noffered for sale. Nearly all of it comes from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe official residence of the governor-general, a city hall of\r\nfantastic Oriental architecture, and a Russian cathedral with five\r\ngreen domes, are the most conspicuous buildings except the barracks\r\nand military hospital. Just outside of the city is an immense military\r\nschool, accommodating five hundred cadets, and a hospital for sick\r\nsoldiers, almost as large. Nearly every other man you meet on the\r\nstreet wears a military uniform, and the dining-room at the hotel\r\nlooks like an officers’ mess at headquarters, for most of the tables\r\nare occupied by colonels and generals and favoured gentlemen of the\r\nstaff. These signs illustrate the importance of Vladikavkas to the\r\nRussian government, and, although the czar is on friendly terms with\r\neverybody just at present, his preparations for war do not seem to be\r\nsuspended. In addition to commanding the approaches to the Dariel Pass,\r\nVladikavkas is also the northern terminus of the Manisson Pass, the\r\nonly other highway over the Caucasus, and is connected with the ancient\r\ncity of Kutias over what is known as the Ossetian Road. The distance is\r\nlonger and the grades are heavier than those of the Dariel Pass, but it\r\nis the shortest route to Batoum and the Black Sea, and for that reason\r\nis of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\nBoth of these passes are heavily fortified and numerous monuments have\r\nbeen erected along the way to mark spots of historic importance and\r\nto inspire the army with a heroic and patriotic feeling. One of these\r\nmonuments is in honour of a private soldier.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, during an uprising of the Circassians, the Mihailovosky fort,\r\nabout half way through the pass, was garrisoned by a detachment of\r\nthe Seventy-seventh regiment of Russian infantry, under command of\r\nCaptain Liko. Being besieged by the rebels and short of provisions and\r\nammunition, he decided to blow up the place at the next assault. The\r\nremaining powder was converted into a mine and placed under the only\r\napproach to the fort, and a private named Arhippe Ossipoff volunteered\r\nto apply the match. When the besieging force had broken down the gates\r\nand were surging through the archway, Ossipoff fired the mine. Nearly\r\nevery man in the Russian garrison and all of the enemy perished, and\r\nthe few survivors crawled down the road to tell the news.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard the story the emperor issued a general order commanding\r\nthat the name of Arhippe Ossipoff should remain forever upon the muster\r\nroll of the Seventy-seventh regiment. Every morning at dress parade it\r\nis called with the rest, when the first sergeant replies:\r\n\r\n“Arhippe Ossipoff died for his country and for the glory of Russia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCASSIANS AND THE COSSACKS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is seventy-two hours by the fastest train from Vladikavkas to\r\nOdessa, which is a practical realization of the size of the Russian\r\nEmpire, but the fastest trains are very slow when measured by the\r\nAmerican standard. The government, which owns and operates all the\r\nrailways in Russia, charges for extra speed on express trains, and then\r\nruns them at twenty miles an hour, with long waits at every station.\r\nIt seemed unnecessary and unreasonable to delay a train for ten or\r\nfifteen minutes every time it stopped, but I thought there must be some\r\nreason for it, and I tried to gratify my curiosity by an investigation.\r\nInquiry disclosed the caution of the railway managers. When a train\r\narrives at a station the conductor notifies the man in charge of the\r\nstation ahead, and also the chief despatcher wherever he may be. He\r\nthen waits for orders. The telegraph operator at the next station\r\nreports to the train despatcher that the track is clear, and the latter\r\nthen, and not until then, gives orders for the waiting train to move.\r\nThey take no chances. On a single track road one train only is given\r\nthe right of way, regardless of side tracks, and everything else is\r\nheld up until it is reported at the next station.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Type of the old fashioned Circassian]\r\n\r\nThe track traverses the great granary of Russia, which corresponds\r\nto Minnesota and the Dakotas in the United States. The land is held\r\nin large estates, partly cultivated by tenant farmers, and also\r\nby a well organized system under the direction of administrators or\r\nstewards, as they call them. Absentee landlordism is the curse of\r\nthis country, as it was in Ireland, and the profits of the crops are\r\nwasted in St. Petersburg and Paris, in gambling and high living, and in\r\nall possible forms of extravagance. Very little of the money is left\r\nin the country; very little is used to improve the property or the\r\nconditions of the tenants, although there are commendable exceptions.\r\nEvery village is an index to the character of the man who owns it.\r\nThe peasant farmers and the employés of an estate dwell and govern\r\nthemselves in communes or mirs, as they are called, and each has a\r\nlittle tract of land for his own use, which he can cultivate at odd\r\ntimes when his services are not needed on the farm. The landlord is\r\nsupposed to keep the houses of his tenants and employés in order, and\r\nis expected to contribute to the support of the poor and afflicted,\r\nto build a church and keep it in order, and to exercise a patriarchal\r\nprotection over everybody who lives on his estates, but this is only\r\ntheoretical in too many cases. The practice of a majority of the\r\nlandlords is to squeeze every cent they can get out of their tenants\r\nand squander it in pleasure and dissipation.\r\n\r\nThe Russians are inveterate and reckless gamblers, and in the play of a\r\nsingle night often lose enough money to make their tenants comfortable\r\nfor a generation. We were told of a Russian landlord of Daghestan who\r\nlost $400,000 in a game at the Jockey Club in Vienna in one night.\r\n\r\nThese big estates, however, are being broken up, under a law passed\r\nsince Russia has a constitution, and are being divided into small\r\nfarms among the families who actually till them.\r\n\r\nLarge towns are few and far between, but the villages are numerous.\r\nThere are three or four cities of 25,000 or 30,000 inhabitants, markets\r\nfor the grain and other produce of the country, in a thousand miles,\r\nbut people there are accustomed to long distances. Rostov is the scene\r\nof the commercial transactions of the population for 300 miles or more\r\non both sides of it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prosperous towns is called Ekaterinodar, which means\r\n“Catherine’s Gift,” and there is a story connected with it. The site\r\nwas presented to a colony of Cossacks by Catherine the Great as a\r\nreward for their loyalty in 1792, and, with the reckless generosity\r\nthat characterized all the acts of that extraordinary woman, she built\r\ntheir houses and shops and churches for them. It is now a thriving city\r\nof 60,000 inhabitants, with a large trade in horses, cattle, sheep, and\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nAt Piatigorski one can get the best view of Elburz, the highest\r\nmountain in Europe, which lifts its proud head 18,526 feet above\r\nthe sea and looks even loftier than it actually is because it rises\r\nalmost directly from the plains. It is buttressed with other peaks\r\n10,000 feet or more in height, but rises above the rest of the range\r\nfully 7,000 feet like a block of Parian marble, pure and spotless and\r\nwithout a flaw, one of the noblest pieces of sculpture ever carved by\r\nthe Creator’s hands. The native poets have called it the “Snow King’s\r\nCitadel,” and it is the abode of Osching Padishah, “Emperor of the\r\nAir.” His diadem of snow is eternal. Dikhtau, 16,924 feet in height,\r\nIkhara, 17,278 feet, Koshantan, 17,196 feet, and Kasbek, 16,546, make\r\nthe finest and grandest group of mountains this side of the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nOn a tablet imbedded in the walls of the public library at Piatigorski\r\nis inscribed a record of the various attempts to ascend Elburz, and\r\na Circassian named Killar is credited as being the first to reach\r\nthe summit. Killar’s achievement is disputed, however, and the first\r\nauthentic ascent was made by two Englishmen, D. W. Freshfield of\r\nBirmingham and a companion, with Swiss alpine guides, in 1868. These\r\ngentlemen climbed Kasbek the same summer, and were probably the first\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nThe Circassians are a superstitious and a poetic people, and like\r\nthe North American Indians, have a legend attached to every freak of\r\nnature and a story to explain every mystery. Their imaginations are as\r\nfertile and as full of poetic conceits as the “Children of the Mist”\r\non the coast of Ireland. It is unfortunate that somebody has not taken\r\nthe trouble to translate their traditions and folk-lore into English.\r\nThe Circassians really have no literature, although their poets have\r\nwritten many charming lines and there are two or three local histories\r\nof merit.\r\n\r\nThey call Kasbek by many names, the “Ice Mountain,” the “Mountain\r\nof Christ,” and the “Mountain of Bethlehem,” and among the ignorant\r\nOssets--one of the largest of the Circassian tribes--the belief exists\r\nthat the tent of Abraham and the manger in which Jesus was born are\r\npreserved in a cavern under the eternal snow.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred years ago an aged priest organized an expedition to\r\nascend the mountain for the recovery of the sacred relics, but the old\r\nman died from fatigue and the rest of the party were driven back by\r\nstorms. Several were so badly frozen that they were crippled for life.\r\nTheir sufferings and their failure were accepted as a decree of fate\r\nand the sacred relics still lie in the cavern concealed by the snow.\r\n\r\nAll the territory west of Vladikavkas to the end of the mountain range\r\nis known as Circassia. The inhabitants are divided into several tribes\r\nof the same race but of distinct organization. They are descended\r\nfrom the ancient Iranians and have occupied their country for about\r\n2,600 years, so far as known. The Circassians are the most reckless,\r\nirresponsible, and superstitious of all the people in that part of the\r\nworld. They are proverbially handsome, of perfect physical proportions,\r\nactive, brave, and temperate in their habits, but heartless, cruel,\r\nrelentless, and always unreliable. Few of them are industrious or\r\nthrifty, or saving, they have no morals and for centuries have sold\r\ntheir daughters to replenish the harems of wealthy Turks.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the name Caucasian was adopted for one of the main\r\nethnological divisions of the human race because Professor Blumenbach\r\nfound the most perfect types of skulls in Circassia.\r\n\r\nThe physical perfection of the women, and their vivacity, their\r\ncheerfulness, their affectionate dispositions, and their adaptability\r\nto any conditions in which they may be placed, made “Circassian\r\nBeauties” the most desirable recruits for the harems, and the low\r\nesteem in which the feminine sex is held by the Circassians made it\r\neasy for them to sell their daughters into slavery. In ancient times\r\nno Turk of any prominence or pride was without at least one Circassian\r\nhouri in his harem. The mother of Abdul Hamid, the late sultan of\r\nTurkey, was a Circassian. But the sale and export of this class of\r\nproduce has been stopped by the Russian authorities, and the changing\r\nconditions in Turkey have diminished the demand for Circassian beauties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Type of the Circassian beauty]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Circassian gentleman]\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless seen them in the side shows of circuses, and in\r\nthe dime museums throughout the world are hundreds of Circassian\r\ngirls leased by their parents for exhibition purposes. While they\r\nare among the proudest of human beings, and, as I have already said,\r\nare celebrated for their affectionate and generous disposition, the\r\nCircassians are the only people in modern times who have ever sold\r\ntheir daughters into slavery.\r\n\r\nAmong other national characteristics, which, however, is confined to\r\nthe Lhesian tribe, is bushy hair, similar to that worn by Paderewski,\r\nthe pianist. It is not universal. It is a tribal fad, and is cultivated\r\nfor the same reason that the German emperor has spent so much time in\r\nthe training of his moustache. Long hair is usually associated with\r\ncranks, artists, and musicians, but in Circassia business men and even\r\nfarmers train their kinky locks to stand out from their skulls until\r\nthey have heads as big as a bushel basket. We see them on the street,\r\nat the railway stations, and other public places.\r\n\r\nThe Circassians are almost always in rebellion against the Russian\r\ngovernment. They are not susceptible to discipline; they will not obey\r\nthe laws and they dislike to pay taxes. Although they profess the\r\nmost intense love of country, in 1858 nearly one half the population\r\nof Circassia emigrated to Asia Minor, Bulgaria, and other provinces\r\nof Turkey, carrying with them their insubordinate dispositions and\r\nreckless habits rather than submit to a code of regulations introduced\r\nby the Russian authorities.\r\n\r\nOne of the tribes, known as the Swannys, still practise the Mosaic\r\ndoctrine of atonement. When an injury is suffered or an offence is\r\ncommitted they do not appeal to the courts, but impose the penalty in\r\nperson upon the cattle or the horses, or the crops or other property,\r\nor upon the person of the offender. It is called “the Code of Blood,”\r\nand the present code was prepared by Prince Royal Vakhtang in 1703. In\r\nthis code the life of a noble, an archbishop or a general is estimated\r\nat 15,000 rubles ($7,500), and each social grade has its value, down to\r\nthe peasant, whose life is estimated at 6,000 rubles. If the offender\r\nhas no cash there is a clause authorizing that “cattle may be given in\r\nlieu of coin.” A horse is estimated at sixty rubles and a bullock at\r\ntwenty in such settlements. If the offender refuses to settle for money\r\nthe price is paid in blood.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years ago a Circassian of wealth and influence, of education\r\nand refinement, told a friend of mine in Odessa that he intended to\r\nkill one of his neighbours at the first opportunity because the man\r\nwas odious to him and was making love to his daughter. He was afraid\r\nthe girl would yield to his blandishments and therefore thought it\r\njudicious to kill him. He had come to Odessa in advance of committing\r\nthe crime for the purpose of borrowing funds to pay the blood money.\r\n\r\nRostov-on-the-Don, the capital of the Cossacks, is a live city, with\r\nan enterprising and prosperous population of 160,000 or more; wide\r\nstreets, fine business blocks, handsome homes, attractive parks,\r\nsplendid churches, and all the modern improvements. It is one of the\r\ngreatest grain shipping ports in the world, being favourably situated\r\nat the mouth of the river Don, and at the head of the Sea of Azov,\r\nbut that body of water is so shallow that most of the grain barges\r\nthat come down the river are towed on to Taganrog, the next port,\r\nabout thirty miles below, where there is enough water to accommodate\r\na 2,500-ton steamer. The channel at Rostov is only twelve feet. The\r\nSea of Azov is very shallow over its entire area, and has flat, sandy\r\nshores, which slope so gently that a bather can wade two or three miles\r\ninto the water without wetting his ears. The Russian government has\r\npromised to dredge a deeper channel and probably will do so one of\r\nthese days.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Don is a famous wheat field, stretching back for\r\na hundred miles or more on both sides of its banks, and producing\r\nlarge crops. The land is mostly owned by the Cossacks. They are very\r\nprogressive and seek the most efficient means of multiplying their\r\nlabour. Hence Rostov has an enormous trade in agricultural machinery\r\nand implements. Several American companies have agencies there. The\r\nCossacks buy a great deal of machinery and implements, mostly Russian\r\nploughs, American harvesters, hay rakes, spreaders, etc., and English\r\nthreshing machines.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Don is owned by the Cossacks. The entire province\r\nbelongs to the tribe collectively and is allotted in parcels of various\r\nsizes to the different families, who occupy and cultivate it generation\r\nafter generation, although the title remains in the tribe. The\r\nfisheries in the river and the Sea of Azov, the timber on the slopes\r\nof the mountains, and everything else in the way of real property\r\nbelongs to the tribe in common. Some of the Cossacks have individual\r\nwealth, none are poor. Those who save money and let it accumulate by\r\nfortunate investments, however, are comparatively few. The majority are\r\nspendthrifts. They know they will be taken care of by their tribe,\r\nand that takes away the incentive to economy. The individual wealth\r\nconsists of horses, cattle, securities, household furniture, ornaments,\r\nand investments of various sorts. Every Cossack, therefore, when he is\r\nborn is immediately a land owner.\r\n\r\nThe name Cossack was originally spelled “Kasak,” and is a Tartar word\r\nmeaning vagabond. This indicates the origin of this famous clan.\r\nThe original Cossacks were adventurers and outlaws from Circassia,\r\nDaghestan, Georgia, and other parts of the Caucasus, whose restless\r\ndisposition drove them away from the homes of their fathers. They\r\njoined the Russians living along the banks of the river and made up\r\nthat portion of the czar’s subjects known as the “Cossacks of the Don.”\r\n\r\nAlthough they consider themselves the most essential part of the\r\nRussian Empire, the Cossacks have always insisted upon maintaining\r\ntheir independence and are actually a state within a state. They\r\nwere always wild and irresponsible and made guerrilla raids upon the\r\nadjoining provinces. In 1770 they supported a pretender to the Russian\r\nthrone, who gave himself the title of Peter III. His followers ravaged\r\nthe valley of the Volga and threatened Moscow, but in 1775 were beaten\r\nin battle with terrible loss. Pugatcheff, the pretender, was captured\r\nand executed. After a time the Cossacks were granted amnesty and made\r\na treaty with the government of Catherine II, under which they were\r\ngiven a vast tract of land on both sides of the river Don, and were\r\nmade practically independent. In return for these privileges they\r\nagreed to furnish the czar a certain number of soldiers for his army,\r\nwithout pay. That is the reason the Cossacks, the most important corps\r\nin the Russian service, receive no compensation or rations or other\r\nsupplies. They provide their own horses and uniforms, their own guns\r\nand ammunition, their own camp equipage, and receive no money whatever\r\nfrom the public treasury.\r\n\r\nEvery Cossack is a soldier for life, subject to instant orders, and\r\nalways keeps a horse saddled and a rifle loaded ready for service.\r\nA certain number are always in the army. Every Cossack is expected\r\nto serve fifteen years consecutively and be ready to answer every\r\ncall that is made. The only exemption is made in favour of the sons\r\nof dependent mothers, bread winners of families dependent upon them,\r\nfathers who already have three sons in the service, priests and\r\nteachers, and one out of four brothers. A rich Cossack can hire a\r\nsubstitute if he pleases, and many of them do so.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Cossacks are Tartars and come from Mohammedan stock, most\r\nof them belong to what is known as the “Old Believers,” a sect of the\r\nRussian Greek Church which condemns the splendour and extravagance\r\ndisplayed in the houses of worship, the ritual, and in the ceremonies\r\nof the Church, and advocates a return to the simple forms of worship\r\npractised by the Saviour and His disciples. A small number of the\r\nCossacks still remain Mohammedans.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful black horses which the Cossacks ride and which are\r\nadmired by every one who visits Russia come chiefly from the province\r\nof Tamboff, southeast of Moscow, northeast of Odessa, northwest of\r\nRostov and adjoining the Cossack province. This stock was introduced\r\nfrom Arabia by Prince Orloff, the famous favourite of the Empress\r\nCatherine II, and were scattered by him among the stock growers in\r\ndifferent parts of European Russia. Tamboff became the centre of the\r\nbreeding business because conditions are most favourable there. It may\r\nbe called the Kentucky of Russia. Nearly all the farmers have breeding\r\nstuds. There are several estates with thousands of mares that drop a\r\ncolt each annually. They are all dead black, without a blemish, with\r\nlong tails, beautiful thick manes, gentle dispositions, great speed\r\nand endurance. The breeder never sells a mare; you never see a mare\r\nworking in harness--always a stallion, and they cost on the farm from\r\ntwo hundred and fifty dollars up.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of southern Russia are quite contented with present\r\nconditions. They have always been loyal to the czar, but they\r\napplauded the constitution and unanimously approve of the legislative\r\ngovernment. They are also very generally in favour of the platform\r\nof the constitutional democrats, which advocates making the ministry\r\nresponsible to the duma, instead of the czar, and thus having a\r\nparliamentary party like that of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe government has established a string of land banks in order to loan\r\nmoney to the farmers to buy land and to improve their holdings. When a\r\nlarge estate is offered for sale the land is divided into small farms\r\nby government appraisers, who fix the value and make out the deeds to\r\nthe purchasers. The land bank advances the money and takes a mortgage\r\non the property for thirty-five years at 3¼ per cent., 2½ per cent.\r\nbeing considered as interest and ¼ per cent. being placed in a sinking\r\nfund to redeem the bonds that are issued to raise the purchase money.\r\n\r\nThe farmer pays his annual interest into the bank in four quarterly\r\ninstalments. I was told that the sale of the lands belonging to\r\nthe crown and to the church is practically a humbug. A large area\r\nbelonging to both has been sold, but it was of comparatively little\r\nvalue. The best quality and the largest proportion of both church and\r\ncrown lands have been reserved and will not be sold until some future\r\nrevolution compels the government to dispose of them.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of 1906 is practically forgotten. As soon as the farmers\r\nof southern Russia got a law passed allowing them to buy farms of their\r\nown they accepted the situation in good faith and have relied upon\r\nthe government to carry out its part of the agreement honestly. As\r\nsoon as they have land that they can call their own they are perfectly\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\nMost of these peasant farmers are descended from serfs, who were\r\nemancipated by Alexander II and they continue to live upon the soil\r\nwhich their fathers worked as slaves, and they recognize the sons of\r\nthe men who owned their ancestors as their “patrons.”\r\n\r\nThe average Russian peasant is honest and industrious; he pays his\r\ntaxes and gives one fifth of all his income to the church, but he has\r\na terrible appetite for strong drink, and vodka, the Russian brandy,\r\nmade of potatoes, is his curse. The government, however, has done a\r\ngreat deal to promote temperance. It has a monopoly of the liquor\r\nbusiness, both in manufacture and sale, and its policy to prohibit\r\nthe sale of liquor in agricultural villages has been strictly applied\r\nto a considerable section in southern Russia, where no strong drink\r\nof any kind can be obtained. Some of the country districts, generally\r\nspeaking, are strictly prohibition, but the sale of liquor as a\r\nbeverage is still permitted in the cities and the larger towns, and at\r\nfirst-class restaurants, hotels, and eating houses.\r\n\r\nA benevolent society, of which the duke of Orenburg, a brother-in-law\r\nof the czar, is president, is doing a great deal of good in supplying\r\nsubstitutes for saloons--temperance resorts and loafing places, where\r\nthe peasants can spend the long winter evenings amusing themselves,\r\nwithout getting drunk. Non-alcoholic drinks are sold at these places,\r\nwith a sufficient profit to maintain them, and they are now found in\r\nalmost every village.\r\n\r\nThe greatest drawback among the peasant class in southern Russia is the\r\nlack of schools. If the church would spend less money for gilded domes\r\nand resplendent decorations in its houses of worship, and more for\r\nschool-houses, it would be a great benefit to the people. But whenever\r\nyou criticise the absence of school-houses, the loyal Russian always\r\nattributes it to the lack of teachers. If you discuss the subject with\r\nschool boards and other educational authorities, they will tell you\r\nthat it is impossible to obtain competent teachers. The chief reason\r\nis the low wages offered by the government. The peasants have been\r\nmaking money for several years. They are saving it, and many of them\r\nare using every means within their reach, except education, to improve\r\ntheir condition. They have better homes and furniture than they ever\r\nhad before; they are breeding up their horses, sheep and cattle; they\r\nare buying labour-saving machinery and the best seed in the market, and\r\nstill have money in the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE CRIMEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crimea, the loveliest gem in the crown of the czar, is a trophy\r\ncaptured by Catherine the Great in one of the numerous wars of conquest\r\nthat have been brought by the Russians against Turkey. These wars have\r\nbeen going on at intervals for centuries, and will continue to occur\r\nuntil the patriarch of the Greek orthodox church presides again at St.\r\nSophia, the most famous of all Mohammedan mosques--once a Christian\r\ntemple. The Turks let the sign of the cross remain upon the pediment\r\nover the entrance that faces toward Mecca as a reminder and a taunt to\r\nthe Christian world.\r\n\r\nAfter Catherine captured the Crimea she attempted to realize the dream\r\nof Peter the Great by chasing the Turks from Europe. She proclaimed\r\nher supremacy over all the northern shore of the Black Sea and\r\nmade preparations to erect her throne in Constantinople. It was a\r\nmagnificent scheme of conquest, and it might have been carried out but\r\nfor the outbreak of the French Revolution and a national uprising under\r\nKosciusko in Poland. Her attention was thus diverted from the south,\r\nand it was left for Nicholas, the “iron czar,” to subdue the Caucasus\r\nand extend the limits of Russia to the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 Catherine made a triumphal journey to visit her new\r\npossessions. She rode in a chariot covered with gold leaf and bearing\r\nher monogram in diamonds upon the doors. The axles of the wheels were\r\nstudded with costly gems and never was such a splendid equipage used by\r\nmortal. It outshone the chariots of the fairies, and you may see it,\r\nif you wish, preserved with other relics of the most luxurious of all\r\nqueens, in the Kremlin at Moscow.\r\n\r\nThe empress was received everywhere with great enthusiasm by the\r\ncommunities her soldiers had conquered. Festivals and illuminations\r\nwere prepared to impress her with the loyalty of her new subjects and\r\nPrince Potemkin, her viceroy, built a road 200 miles long through the\r\nwilderness in order that her journey might be more comfortable. She was\r\nconvinced of the glory and prosperity of her dominions and over the\r\ngate through which she passed into the city of Kherson, thirty miles\r\nnorth of Odessa, was this inscription:\r\n\r\n“This is the way to Byzantium”--the Russian name for Constantinople.\r\n\r\nBy the same war Russia got Odessa and the north shore of the Black Sea.\r\nAlexander I renewed the struggle in 1855, for the purpose of taking the\r\nsouth coast and the northern provinces of Asia Minor from the sultan,\r\nwhen the intervention of England, France, and Sardinia provoked the\r\nCrimean war. It was not until 1877 that the conquest was resumed by\r\nAlexander II, and Russia then gained Batoum, and the eastern shore of\r\nthe Black Sea, and a portion of Armenia; deprived the Great Turk of\r\nBulgaria, Bosnia, and Herzegovina, and established the independence\r\nof Montenegro under the protection of the Powers. And the end is not\r\nyet. The advance of the Russian boundaries toward the Mediterranean and\r\nthe winning of a port upon the Pacific as an outlet for the products\r\nof Siberia are the fixed policy of the Romanoffs and they will\r\nfight until they get it. The late war with Japan set back the pointer\r\nupon the dial of Russian conquest, and the results which had been\r\naccomplished by diplomacy in Manchuria were lost. That will all have to\r\nbe done over again, and the task will be ten-fold more difficult, but\r\nit will nevertheless be attempted, sooner or later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gateway to Aloupka Palace, The Crimea]\r\n\r\nBy the next war Russia expects to gain the south coast of the Black\r\nSea, and the northern provinces of Asia Minor. In anticipation of\r\nearly possession, Nicholas Cherikoff, the czar’s ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, has succeeded in concluding a treaty under which the\r\nTurkish government is pledged not to permit the subjects of any other\r\nnation but Russia to build railways, to buy mines, to secure control\r\nof any form of property, or engage in any form of enterprise in that\r\nterritory. When an American syndicate was seeking a railway concession\r\nin Asia Minor not long ago its representatives were notified by the\r\nTurkish minister of public works that it could not build its tracks\r\nnorth of Sivas; that Russia claimed exclusive rights in the belt\r\nof provinces lying along the southern coast of the Black Sea. This\r\nhumiliating confession is loaded with significance. It illustrates\r\nthe foresight and the determination with which the Russian policy of\r\nconquest is conducted.\r\n\r\nThe Crimea is one of the loveliest spots on earth--“A Little Paradise,”\r\nthe Tartar inhabitants call it, as fertile as it is beautiful, with a\r\nclimate as attractive as its scenery, and every physical condition that\r\nis favourable to health, happiness, and prosperity. That is one of the\r\nreasons why the peninsula has been fought over so fiercely through all\r\nthe ages by the dominating nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula, which extends from the southern coast of Russia into\r\nthe Black Sea, is almost circular in form, and measures 225 miles\r\neast and west and 155 miles north and south at its widest points. The\r\ntotal area is about ten thousand English square miles. The delightful\r\nclimate and the scenic attractions have made the Crimea the playground\r\nof Russia, and the southern coast is lined with splendid villas\r\nbelonging to rich nobles, merchants, and manufacturers, and hotels of\r\nall descriptions, villages of boarding-houses, and popular resorts for\r\nthe accommodation of the ten thousand. The hotels are open the year\r\naround, the thermometer runs up to ninety degrees in midsummer, but the\r\nheat is tempered by cool breezes that play upon the Black Sea, and in\r\nwinter the climate is ideal. The best months for comfort are May, June,\r\nOctober, and November, and the imperial family of Russia usually spend\r\nthem here at a villa called Livadia, where the late Alexander III died\r\nseveral years ago.\r\n\r\nA range of mountains called the Yallis runs parallel with the southern\r\nand eastern coast, culminating in Tohadyr-Dagh, a peak which rises\r\n4,800 feet above the waters of the Black Sea, and is surrounded by\r\nother peaks between three thousand and four thousand feet in height.\r\nThe southern coast is very abrupt and picturesque. The cliffs rise\r\nabruptly from the water to the height of 2,000, 3,000 and even 4,000\r\nfeet, and are crowned with domes, pyramids, pinnacles, and spires\r\nof rock as fantastic as the architecture of a dream. The cliffs are\r\nhoneycombed with caverns caused by the decomposition of the limestone\r\nand are the delight of geologists, because of their stalactites and\r\nstalagmite formations. Other phenomena are abundant. Hot springs\r\nand mud volcanoes bubble up, spout steam, and indulge in other\r\nfrightful manifestations, which made the Crimea uncanny and mysterious\r\nto the ancients, but in these prosaic days the hot mud is used to\r\ncure rheumatism and skin diseases, and the hot water to restore the\r\ndigestive apparatus of Russian gluttons.\r\n\r\nThese caverns were once inhabited by a mysterious race called the\r\nCimmerians and Troglodytes, who were supposed to live in darkness and\r\nworshipped a virgin goddess named Iphigenia. When a stranger landed\r\non their shores they robbed him and sacrificed him on her altars. In\r\nmodern times the hotel landlords carry on a similar business on a cash\r\nbasis. They allow strangers to depart with their lives, but without\r\ntheir money.\r\n\r\nThe mountains of the Crimea are covered with dense forests and wild\r\nflowers grow there more abundantly than in any other part of Europe.\r\nThe woods and meadows are carpeted with white and purple violets. The\r\ntulip, the veronica, the lily of the valley, the geranium, sweet peas,\r\nand other flowering plants reach perfection in a wild state, and are so\r\nplentiful that nobody thinks of cultivating them. In the northern part\r\nof the Crimea are salt lakes from which a hundred million pounds of\r\nsalt are harvested annually by evaporation, and distributed throughout\r\nRussia, bringing much profit to the operators, and a large revenue to\r\nthe government. The coast abounds in a great variety of fish, which\r\nfurnish another profitable occupation for the people, and are shipped\r\nby train loads into the interior of Russia every day.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the Crimea produced vast quantities of corn, which\r\nwas exported to Greece and Rome and other Mediterranean countries,\r\nbut agriculture has been supplanted by horticulture, and the sunny\r\nslopes of the peninsula are covered with orchards and vineyards and\r\ntruck gardens. The Crimea is famous for wines, although they are\r\ntoo sweet and heavy for the American taste. Fruits of every kind,\r\npeaches, apples, pears, plums, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries,\r\nand currants, walnuts, almonds, chestnuts, hazel nuts, melons, and\r\nvegetables of every variety are produced in enormous quantities\r\nand shipped to northern Russia. The Crimea is the hothouse, the\r\nconservatory of the empire, and supplies early vegetables to the tables\r\nof the rich residents of St. Petersburg and Moscow, as the truck forms\r\nof Florida provide for those of our northern cities.\r\n\r\nThe largest part of the population of the Crimea are\r\nTartars--Crim-Tartars they are called, to distinguish them from other\r\nrepresentatives of that race--Crim being the Russian form of the word\r\nCrimea. They are Mohammedans and have a streak of the savage left\r\nin them. No Tartar was ever thoroughly civilized. They resemble the\r\nSicilians in character and habits--in their passionate natures, their\r\njealous dispositions, their vendetta and love of revenge, but they are\r\na sober, industrious, generous-hearted people, whose most sacred fetich\r\nis hospitality. They never turn a stranger, even a tramp, from the\r\ndoor. They are always courteous, always deferential and expect their\r\nkindness to be returned in good faith.\r\n\r\nThe Crim-Tartars have a genius for gardening. They love plants and\r\ntrees and flowers. Whatever they sow brings forth a thousand-fold. They\r\ntend the orchards and the gardens of the peninsula, raise the fruit and\r\nmake the wines, carry on the fisheries, furnish household servants\r\nfor the hotels, boarding-houses and villas, and leave shop-keeping\r\nand trading to the Armenians and the Jews, who are numerous there\r\nas everywhere else in southern Russia, and control financial and\r\nmercantile affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Crimea is a fascinating field for historians and archæologists,\r\nfor its original inhabitants furnished much material for mythology,\r\nand their remains abound in various parts of the little peninsula. The\r\nCimmerians, the first inhabitants referred to in history, were known\r\nto Homer and Herodotus, and their gloomy situation is described in the\r\n“Odyssey” xi, 15:\r\n\r\n     “There in a lonely land and gloomy cells\r\n      The dusky nation of Cimmeria dwells;\r\n      Unhappy race! Whom endless night invades,\r\n      Clouds the dull air and wraps them round in shades.”\r\n\r\nThe Scythians, an Asiatic tribe, drove the Cimmerians out of the\r\nCrimea in 680 B.C. The latter crossed the Black Sea and settled along\r\nthe coast of Asia Minor. Thence they spread over Europe and were the\r\nfounders of three races--the Welsh, the Milesians, and the Goths. Welsh\r\nnames abound throughout the Crimea, and in the mountains of Wales the\r\nold families are known as Cymry.\r\n\r\nThe Strait of Kertch, which connects the Sea of Azov with the Euxine,\r\nor Black Sea, is labelled the “Cimmerian Bosphorus” on all the early\r\nmaps. The word Bosphorus means, literally, “the passage of an ox,” and\r\nis an ancient designation of all streams and water-courses which will\r\npermit an ox to cross them by wading or swimming.\r\n\r\nThe port of Theodosia, the first important town on the Black Sea south\r\nof Kertch, dates back a thousand years before the Christian era and was\r\nknown to Ptolemy, Strabo, Pliny, and the historians and geographers of\r\nthe Romans, Greeks, and the Egyptians under the name Caffa; afterward\r\nas Ardava, which means “the city of the seven gods.” This was the\r\ncapital of the Milesians in the seventh century before Christ, and it\r\nwas a place of great importance. Scattered throughout the country are\r\ntumuli, which are believed to be the graves of kings, and several of\r\nthem have already been explored with surprising success. Herodotus,\r\nthe Greek historian, who must have visited Crimea about 375 or 400\r\nB.C., describes the peninsula in considerable detail, and tells about\r\nthe burial ceremonies of Scythian chieftains. The same customs were\r\nfollowed by the Milesians in Ireland centuries afterward.\r\n\r\nHe relates that when a king died his body was embalmed and laid in\r\na tomb surrounded by at least one of his wives and several of his\r\nservants and his horse, who were strangled for that purpose. His\r\nweapons, golden cups, and other articles of daily use were placed\r\nbeside him in the sepulchre, in order that he might be properly\r\nequipped in the next world. Earth was then piled upon the tomb until it\r\nformed a miniature mountain. Several of these tumuli have been opened;\r\none, in which Parisades I, who was king of Crimea in the fifth century\r\nB.C., was buried, contained the skeletons of his queen, of several\r\nattendants, a horse with helmet and greaves, various arms and utensils\r\nfor eating and drinking, and the bones of a sheep.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Kertch are extensive catacombs similar to those\r\nbuilt by the early Christians in Rome. Excavations conducted under the\r\ndirection of the Russian authorities several years ago disclosed rich\r\nornaments of gold and silver, quaint arms and utensils of exquisite\r\nworkmanship, which are now in the Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg.\r\nThe walls of the catacombs are plastered over and covered with\r\ncryptographs and paintings, containing the history of prominent people\r\nwho are buried near by. They are similar to the inscriptions on the\r\nEgyptian tombs, and represent combats, hunting scenes, court ceremonies\r\nand various other human activities, with accurate pictures of horses,\r\noxen, dogs, and other animals. The men are usually represented in\r\nshirts of mail, wearing trousers supported by belts and conical\r\ncaps similar to the Turkish fez. These catacombs date back at least\r\ntwenty-five hundred years, and in several cases the occupants can be\r\nidentified as the early sovereigns of the Cimmerians and the Milesians.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth century B.C., a Greek colony from Ionia settled near\r\nKertch and dedicated their city to the god Pan, calling it Panticapæum.\r\nCoins bearing the effigy of that divinity have been dug up in the\r\nneighbourhood. In the same century the Scythians sent a force of men\r\ninto Asia Minor to assist in repelling the invasion of Darius. In the\r\nyear 480 B.C. the king of the Crimea was Archæanax. His successor was\r\nSpartacus, who died 438 B.C. The people of the peninsula preserved\r\ntheir independence until 115 B.C., when Parisades, the last native\r\nking, surrendered to Mithridates, who was the sovereign of twenty-two\r\nnations, and able to converse with the inhabitants of all of them\r\nwithout an interpreter.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on the Crimea was the scene of continual struggles. The\r\nGreeks, the Persians, the Romans, the Goths, the Huns, the Genoese,\r\nthe Venetians, the Byzantines, and other races succeeded one another in\r\ncontrol at intervals of a century or two. The Golden Horde of Tartars\r\nin the fourteenth century drove out the Genoese and retained control,\r\nalthough compelled to pay tribute to the Turks, until in 1771, when\r\nthe Tartar khan, Sahym Ghyrey, surrendered to Prince Potemkin and the\r\nCrimea became a part of the Russian empire.\r\n\r\nOne of the early rulers, Pharnaces, son of Mithridates, A.D. 63, was\r\nin command of the forces that were whipped by Cæsar so easily at the\r\nbattle of Zelah as to cause him to send his famous despatch to the\r\nRoman senate: “Veni! Vidi! Vici!”\r\n\r\nAnother of the kings of the Crimea, Polemo II, a pagan, married the\r\ndaughter of King Agrippa of Bible fame and adopted the Jewish faith,\r\nwhich he afterward renounced when his wife deserted him.\r\n\r\nThe Tartar khanate, which dates from 1380, had its capital at\r\nBaghtchasarai, about thirty miles northeast of Sevastopol and the same\r\ndistance northwest of Yalta. The Khan Sarai, or palace, was restored\r\nand refurnished according to the original style by Prince Potemkin\r\nfor the reception of Catherine the Great when she visited the Crimea\r\nin 1787. It is a fantastic building of barbaric splendour, and it is\r\nsaid to be described in the famous poem “Lallah Rookh.” The Russian\r\npoet Pushkin rhapsodizes over its beauties in some pretty verses\r\nof description. It is by no means as beautiful or as extensive as\r\nthe Alhambra in Spain, but resembles it in the arrangement and the\r\ndecoration of the apartments.\r\n\r\nThere are several well-preserved tombs of the khans who reigned\r\nbetween 1380 and 1786, including a graceful mausoleum, similar to those\r\nat Delhi outside the walls, in which repose the mortal remains of\r\nDeliarah Bikeh, the beautiful Georgian wife of Khan Shahim Gherai. Her\r\noriginal name was Maria Potorzka. She was the daughter of a Georgian\r\nchieftain, a Christian by birth and training, and refused to change\r\nher religion. In one of the apartments of the palace is a fountain\r\nwhich her husband, Shahim Gherai, erected in her memory as a symbol of\r\nthe tears he shed after her death. It is called “the flood of tears.”\r\nOutside the walls, in an octagonal mausoleum with a dome, she is\r\nburied, and over the door is written in Tartar characters:\r\n\r\n“This is the tomb of Deliarah Bikeh, beloved wife of Shahim Gherai,\r\ndied 1746 A.D. She was a Christian.”\r\n\r\nThe fountain bears the same date.\r\n\r\nAbout four miles from the town, upon the crest of a lofty crag called\r\nChufut Kaleh (“Jewish rock”) is another stately tomb. It is regarded\r\nas one of the finest specimens of Tartar architecture in existence,\r\nand was erected in 1437 in honour of a Jewess, Nene Kejeh, queen of\r\nToktamysh, khan of the Golden Horde.\r\n\r\nThere are many Jews in this part of the Crimea, whose ancestors came\r\nthere eight centuries before the Christian era. They are of the Karaim\r\nsect and follow the Mosaic laws strictly. They are supposed to have\r\nmany old manuscripts of priceless value, but the Russian government\r\nhas never been able to secure any of them for the Imperial Library\r\nat St. Petersburg, although repeated attempts have been made. The\r\nmuseums at St. Petersburg have collections of great value and interest\r\nillustrating the arts, industries, habits, and customs of the early\r\noccupants of the Crimean peninsula. There are also many interesting\r\nethnological and archæological examples in a pretty little museum at\r\nOdessa; but only a few of the ruins of ancient cities have ever been\r\nexcavated and many tumuli remain unexplored. It is a popular impression\r\nthat the manuscripts carried from Jerusalem at the time of the\r\ncaptivity and brought to the Crimea shortly after, are numerous and of\r\nthe greatest value, but the rabbis pretend to know nothing of them.\r\n\r\nThe Karaims in the Crimea have enjoyed full rights and privileges\r\nas citizens of Russia since 1802 and have never suffered from the\r\nrestrictions and persecutions of their race elsewhere. They live in a\r\nsuburb of Baghtchasarai, from choice and not from compulsion. The name\r\nmeans “the stronghold of Israel,” and it has been the headquarters\r\nof the community for 2,500 years. From this stronghold the sons of\r\nKaraim have scattered over the peninsula and along the northern coast\r\nof the Black Sea in pursuit of trade, and like most of their brethren,\r\nthey are industrious, energetic, and successful competitors in every\r\nbusiness in which they engage.\r\n\r\nTheir synagogue stands upon a hill called Mount Zion, their cemetery is\r\nin the valley of Jehoshaphat, where thousands of tombstones bear Hebrew\r\ninscriptions. The most ancient epitaph that can be deciphered commends\r\nthe virtues and piety of a rabbi, Moses Levi, who died “in the year 726\r\nafter the exile,” which is the same as the year 30 A.D. Another marks\r\nthe grave of “Zadok, son of Moses the Levite, who died 4,000 years\r\nafter the creation, and 785 years after the exile,” which was 89 A.D.\r\n\r\nThere are many Karaims in southern Russia, and more in Egypt and\r\nTurkey. They are found in larger or smaller numbers everywhere along\r\nthe coast of the Mediterranean. They adapt themselves very readily to\r\ntheir surroundings. In the Crimea they speak the Tartar language; in\r\nOdessa they speak Russian; in Athens they speak Greek, and in Egypt\r\ntheir language is the Arabic.\r\n\r\nThe market place of Baghtchasarai is one of the most interesting places\r\nin the Crimea. The display of fruits and vegetables makes the observer\r\nhungry. It also gives an unusually good opportunity to study ethnology,\r\nfor representatives of the most ancient races in the world, which have\r\nexhausted themselves or have been exterminated elsewhere, may be found\r\nengaged in ordinary avocations, unconscious of the fact that, counting\r\ngenerations of ancestors, they are entitled to the distinction of being\r\nthe aristocracy of the earth. The Jews, the Cimmerians, the Milesians,\r\nthe Scythians, the Tauri, families in the Crimea, have pedigrees that\r\nrun back farther than human history.\r\n\r\nThe habitations of European seashore resorts are very much alike, and\r\nconsist of solid rows of masonry packed as closely as possible, with\r\nlarge windows fronting the water. The ground floors are always occupied\r\nby a series of gayly decorated show windows, with small shops behind\r\nthem, restaurants, cafés, flower stalls, and confectioners. On the\r\nopposite side of the street there is always a sea wall, with a heavy\r\nstone balustrade, protecting a cement promenade, from which piers\r\nat intervals extend over the water and to the bath houses that are\r\nclustered on the beach. All the life and all the ardour of those who\r\ncome for health or pleasure are expended upon this thoroughfare, which\r\nis crowded from ten to eleven o’clock in the morning until midnight,\r\nand the restaurants, tea pavilions and cafés are always filled with\r\npeople eating and drinking and having what they consider a good time.\r\n\r\nYalta, which is considered the Newport of Russia, the most fashionable\r\nresort for both winter and summer in that great empire, resembles,\r\nin the way I have described, those of France and Spain, Italy and\r\nEngland, but here nature has also offered irresistible inducements for\r\nthe rich people to build villas upon the slopes of the mountains that\r\nrise in the background, leaving a belt of about a mile wide to be thus\r\noccupied. There is a Greek church, with five gilded domes, numerous\r\nhotels and handsome residences belonging to grand dukes, princes and\r\nother dignitaries; rich merchants and manufacturers. They are mostly of\r\nvery ornate architecture, built of rough brick or stone, covered with\r\nwhite stucco and embellished with elaborate mouldings over the windows\r\nand doors and along the cornices and the balconies. Some of them are\r\npainted, and, in two or three cases, the owners have their coats of\r\narms displayed in brilliant colours on the walls.\r\n\r\nOne of the most attractive villas is that of the emir of Bokhara, a\r\npolitical protegé of the Russian government. He goes there every winter\r\nand sometimes in the summer, also, for he is glad to get away from home\r\nas often as the Russian government will permit him. His villa is a fine\r\nspecimen of Saracenic architecture. He has a farm back in the hills,\r\nalso, but seldom goes there.\r\n\r\nThe hotels are very comfortable, large rooms well furnished, good meals\r\nwell served, and, during the summer months, the tables are placed on\r\nthe lawn, a practice which the managers of the hotels at our summer\r\nresorts at home might adopt to the comfort of their patrons, instead\r\nof feeding them in hot, close dining-rooms, blazing with light. In the\r\nheat of midsummer a dinner will be relished a great deal more if it is\r\nserved on a lawn under the shade of a tree in the soft twilight, than\r\nin a superheated dining-room. The charges are high, quite as high as\r\nthey are at any of our fashionable resorts, but that is to be expected.\r\nEuropean hotel people have discovered to their profit that tourists\r\nwill pay whatever is asked, and there are no more ten-franc-a-day\r\nstopping places on the continent.\r\n\r\nThe bath houses are not so large nor so good as in America, and\r\ncomparatively few people bathe. The women are afraid of spoiling their\r\ncomplexions and the men find more sport in other diversions.\r\n\r\nThere are lovely drives in every direction from Yalta, and waterfalls,\r\ngorges, highly decorated gardens, dense groves, observation towers,\r\nrestaurants and all sorts of attractions scattered along the slopes of\r\nthe mountains, which rise 2,500 or 3,000 feet behind the town. I am\r\ntold that there is an average of about 7,500 visitors at Yalta daily\r\nthe year around, for in that climate, like that of Monterey and Santa\r\nBarbara, California, one month is as pleasant as another. Hence, people\r\nfrom the north of Russia come in the winter and people from the south\r\nof Russia in the summer, and the hotels are always filled.\r\n\r\nThere is no railway, although they are talking of one to connect with\r\nthe trunk lines that run between Sevastopol and Moscow. Everybody\r\nhas to come on the steamers from Sevastopol, Odessa, Nicholaief,\r\nRostov, Batoum, and other ports on the Black Sea. The visitors from\r\nSt. Petersburg, Moscow and other northern points take a train to\r\nSevastopol and then come around by steamer in four hours, or by\r\ncarriage over a wonderful mountain road, a ten-hour ride. The steamers\r\nare not very comfortable because the state-rooms are all below the\r\nwater line, so that the port holes cannot be opened, and there is no\r\nventilation; but the voyage between Yalta and Sevastopol is made both\r\nways in the day-time, in order to give passengers an opportunity to\r\nenjoy the magnificent mountain scenery along the coast, and they keep\r\nwell in toward the shore for that purpose. I do not know of any other\r\nsea voyage that will equal it for scenery.\r\n\r\nThere is a roadway around to Sevastopol from Yalta cut out of the side\r\nof the cliff, on a level averaging 300 or 400 feet above the water,\r\nand often running as high as a thousand feet on the slopes of the\r\nprecipices, which was built by the late Prince Woronzoff. It is one of\r\nthe most delightful and picturesque drives you can imagine. You leave\r\nSevastopol at nine o’clock in the morning, lunch at the Gate of Baidar,\r\nwhich is the water shed, spend the night at Aloupka, and drive over to\r\nYalta in time for luncheon the next morning. There is a procession of\r\ncarriages loaded with tourists going both ways daily.\r\n\r\nFor nearly the entire distance a wall of rock rises from 1,000 to 4,000\r\nfeet almost abruptly from the Black Sea, being broken at intervals by\r\ngorges and narrow valleys which run back into the fertile fields in the\r\ninterior of the Crimea. Wherever there is room for a handful of soil it\r\nis cultivated. There are Tartar villages every few miles, and between\r\nthem orchards, vineyards, gardens, and truck farms, from which fruit\r\nand vegetables are shipped to St. Petersburg and Moscow. The tables of\r\nthe rich people of those cities and other parts of Russia are supplied\r\nwith early vegetables and fruit from this source.\r\n\r\nBelow the roadway and between it and the water many beautiful villas\r\nare located among the rocks and the trees. Hotels and sanitariums occur\r\nevery few miles. The hard, smooth roads are kept in perfect order and\r\ndecorated on both sides with sweetbriar roses, which continue to bloom\r\nthrough the entire summer. There are myriads of wild flowers also, for\r\nwhich the Crimea is famous, and it is said to have a larger variety\r\nthan any other place in the world.\r\n\r\nThis coast is much more beautiful than that of Dalmatia, although it\r\nlacks the life and colour that is given the latter by the costumes\r\nof the women and the men. It is more like the drive from Cork to the\r\nLakes of Killarney than any other place I know. The French Riviera is\r\nmore finished and polished and complete, the villas are finer; the\r\nhotels are more imposing and the architects and landscape gardeners\r\nhave embellished nature to a greater extent, but there is more natural\r\nbeauty on the Crimean coast.\r\n\r\nYou cross the highest point, 2,200 feet, at Baidar Gate which occupies\r\nthe site of an ancient fortification intended to protect the tax\r\ncollector and to prevent hostile armies from passing along this coast,\r\nand there you eat your luncheon upon a balcony from which you can look\r\ndown more than 2,000 feet upon the turquoise waters of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nNear by, upon a promontory projecting out from the precipice, a\r\nbeautiful Byzantine church has been erected as a memorial to a tea\r\nmerchant of Moscow named Kouzedneff, who had a winter villa on the\r\ncoast immediately below. The interior of the church is extravagantly\r\ndecorated and with much taste, and among the paintings is the\r\nChristmas scene in the manger at Bethlehem. A beautiful babe lies on\r\na pile of straw in a stable, emitting a halo of light from its entire\r\nbody, like a block of phosphorus or radium, while a girl and a young\r\nman in the costumes of Russian peasants look down in adoration upon\r\ntheir child.\r\n\r\nAloupka is not so fashionable as Yalta, but is more beautiful. The\r\nlocation is more picturesque and the surroundings are more attractive.\r\nIt is an assortment of hotels, boarding-houses, and sanitariums\r\ncollected around one of the most unique and fascinating country seats\r\nI have ever seen--the palace of the Woronzoff family, built in 1839\r\nby a governor of the Crimea of that name. He was one of the most\r\nfamous fighters in Russian history and one of the ablest executives,\r\nand contributed more to the glory of Catherine the Great than almost\r\nany other of her servants. He was viceroy of the Crimea and afterward\r\nof the Caucasus, and his grandson, Prince Woronzoff Dashkoff, is\r\ngovernor-general of the Caucasus to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Woronzoff palace occupies a terrace one hundred and fifty feet or\r\nso above the Black Sea, and a stately stairway, fit for any palace,\r\nextends from the threshold of the main entrance to the edge of the\r\nwater, being guarded on both sides by marble lions, some of them\r\nasleep, some of them awake, some of them yawning and others in a\r\nplayful mood. The façade was copied from one of the palaces of the\r\nAlhambra, which critics have pronounced very much out of place on\r\na Tudor castle. Four Byzantine towers at the corners of the walls\r\nhave also been objected to as untasteful intrusions. The rest of the\r\narchitecture is in harmony and resembles that of an English castle\r\nof the period of Henry VIII. It was built by Sir Matthew Blore, an\r\nEnglish architect.\r\n\r\nThere is a monumental hall and dining-room with wainscoting and ceiling\r\nof heavy carved oak; a drawing-room done in Wedgwood tiles of blue and\r\nwhite; a second drawing-room in empire style, a library that would\r\nnot be out of place in one of the Oxford colleges, and other rooms of\r\ndignity and perfect order. There is a large courtyard upon which the\r\noffices of the estate and the stables open. The latter are now occupied\r\nby a battalion of troops, which have been considered necessary to\r\nprotect the place since the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe grounds, which are unique, are always open to the public and\r\nattract many visitors to the town. They include a dense artificial\r\nforest of thirty acres at the foot of a precipice 4,000 feet high,\r\nfilled with enormous bowlders that during the ages have fallen from the\r\ncliffs in odd shapes and lodged in positions which the landscape artist\r\nhas utilized in an ingenious and artistic manner. There are said to be\r\n1,140,000 plants. Every tree was planted by hand and 127 varieties are\r\nrepresented. Every plant and flowering shrub that will grow in that\r\nclimate may be found upon the grounds, and we were told that some of\r\nthe varieties cannot be found elsewhere in the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\nEverything seems to be unique. For example, a large bowlder shaped like\r\nan irregular pyramid, with the narrow end upward, has been converted\r\ninto a fountain. A hole has been drilled through it and a pipe has been\r\nlaid which throws a stream of water an inch in diameter to the height\r\nof fifty feet, but strangest of all is the tomb of a pet dog, whose\r\nprecious bones occupy a marble sarcophagus large enough for a child,\r\nplaced in the centre of a cave formed by two enormous bowlders which\r\nlean against each other. Chiseled upon the rock at the side of the\r\nentrance is this epitaph:\r\n\r\n                              CHEMLEK\r\n                   Born in Brussa, May 20, 1861.\r\n                   Died Aloupka, Nov. 24, 1874.\r\n\r\nNear by is a grotto fitted up as a chapel, with an altar and the\r\nstations of the cross, where, the old bearded Tartar who showed us\r\naround said, the Princess Woronzoff-Dashkoff used to pray for the soul\r\nof her dog.\r\n\r\nThe owners seldom visit this beautiful estate. The prince has been\r\nviceroy of the Caucasus at Tiflis for many years and affairs there have\r\nbeen so troublesome as to require all of his attention.\r\n\r\nIn front of the park at Sevastopol is a monumental sea-gate called the\r\n“Grafskaya Pristan,” or “landing place of the nobility.” A stairway of\r\nwhite marble fifty feet wide leads from the edge of the water to the\r\nsummit of the bluff, where is a classic marble pavilion, supported by\r\ntwelve Ionic columns. Here the czar and other distinguished visitors\r\nare received with ceremony. This pavilion was erected as a memorial\r\nto Prince Mihail Simonovitch Woronzoff who, next to Potemkin, was the\r\nempire-builder of southern Russia. Traces of his ability and evidences\r\nof his energy and enterprise are found everywhere. He was one of the\r\nearliest governors of Odessa, where he founded numerous educational and\r\ncharitable institutions and gave an impulse to trade and commerce. He\r\nwas equally a benefactor to Sevastopol and the Grafskaya Pristan was\r\na tribute of the people to the permanent benefit he conferred upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Villa of the Czar at Livadia, Crimea]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting place near by is called “Gaspra,” where three\r\nnotorious women who had been banished from the Russian Court at\r\nSt. Petersburg took refuge and not only repented of their sins but\r\nattempted the impossible task of converting the Tartar population to\r\nChristianity. One of them was the Princess Galatzin, whose amours were\r\nmore notorious than those of Catherine the Great; another was the\r\nBaroness de Krudener, who told Alexander I, to his face, in a crowded\r\nballroom, that he was an awful sinner. The third was the Countess de la\r\nMothe, who was publicly whipped and branded in Paris as an accomplice\r\nin the theft of a diamond necklace from Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\nAnother beautiful estate in that neighbourhood, which belonged to Gen.\r\nLeo Naryshkin, was laid out by Joachim Tascher, said to have been a\r\nnatural half-brother of Josephine, the first empress of France. When\r\nNapoleon became emperor, Josephine offered Tascher a position suitable\r\nto his rank and relationship, but he declined and begged to be allowed\r\nto remain in obscurity, to follow his favourite pursuit of gardening.\r\n\r\nAlexander III, emperor of Russia and father of the present czar, died\r\nOctober 20, 1894, in a pretty little villa near Yalta, on the southern\r\ncoast of the Crimea, overlooking the Black Sea. It was his favourite\r\nresidence, as it was that of his father, Alexander II, before him. At\r\nLivadia he could throw off those dignities which hedge about a king,\r\nand live like an ordinary man. A stately chapel of the Byzantine type\r\nof architecture, with five gilded domes, stands on the hillside near\r\nby as a memorial to this man whose piety and devotion were among his\r\nmost marked characteristics. He was a stern, relentless, implacable\r\nautocrat, very different in character and disposition from his father\r\nand his son, men of amiable disposition and great forbearance.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that every alternate czar has been a tyrant and\r\nevery other one a broad-minded man of liberal views. But Alexander\r\nIII was embittered by the assassination of his father, who was\r\nthe most generous and benevolent of all the czars. He emancipated\r\nthe serfs and gave them land and a draft of a constitution giving\r\nRussia a parliamentary government, which he intended to confer as a\r\nvoluntary gift upon his subjects, lay upon his desk the morning he was\r\nassassinated. He was gentle and considerate and unselfish as McKinley,\r\nand died the same way. No assassination was ever less excusable.\r\n\r\nAlexander III was naturally of a reticent, morbid disposition, without\r\nthe slightest sense of humour, but lofty aspirations and a keen\r\nappreciation of his imperial prerogatives and power. He conceived it to\r\nbe his duty to punish the entire 135,000,000 population of Russia for\r\nthe crime of a few fanatics, and thus arrested the progress of Russian\r\ncivilization during the entire period of his reign. He even went so far\r\nas to issue an edict forbidding the education of the peasants, because\r\nit made them discontented, closing all the schools in Russia to the\r\nchildren of the labouring class and permitting the attendance only of\r\nthose whose parents had a certain income and paid a certain amount of\r\ntaxes. This decree was revoked by his son Nicholas II, who has few of\r\nhis characteristics, and is as different from him as one man can be\r\nfrom another.\r\n\r\nAlexander III sent more poor creatures to Siberia than all the other\r\nczars. He was neither merciful nor just; his heavy hand fell upon\r\nthe innocent as well as the guilty. No modern monarch has caused so\r\nmuch grief, so much suffering, or was guilty of greater cruelty and\r\ninjustice in his administration.\r\n\r\nNo Oriental king of the Middle Ages was more fond of display, or\r\nmore rigorous in his requirements concerning the ceremonies and the\r\netiquette of his court, yet the man loved to escape his imperial\r\nsplendour and seek rest and recreation in a cottage of not more than\r\ntwenty rooms, with his wife and children and a few Tartar servants.\r\nThere he lived the simple life and enjoyed it. There was no ceremony;\r\nthere was no etiquette; there was no imperial prestige to maintain.\r\nThere he became the husband and father instead of the king.\r\n\r\nIn the palaces of St. Petersburg he was always surrounded by Cossacks,\r\npolicemen, and detectives, even in the family circle, and never crossed\r\nthe threshold of his apartments without a military guard. At Livadia,\r\nfearless of anarchists, he wandered about the village with his wife and\r\nchildren, talked familiarly with the Tartar peasants, and often visited\r\nthe villas of his friends. There was a guard at the gate and a sentinel\r\nat the door of the cottage, but he never had an escort when he went out\r\nfor his walks or drives.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of more spacious and pretentious country villas\r\nin Russia; there are hundreds of thousands in the United States more\r\nbeautiful, more luxurious and better equipped than that in which he\r\nlived and died. Every village in America has homes equally elegant\r\nand comfortable, but Alexander III found it the most satisfactory and\r\nthe most restful of all the places in the world. In the little red\r\ncottage, with its broad verandas and its walls half hidden with vines,\r\nhe could forget the affairs of state that made his reign so stormy.\r\n\r\nAlexander II, his father, fled to Livadia every winter for two or three\r\nmonths for relaxation from the stern and tragic life he was compelled\r\nto lead. The present czar has spent his happiest days there, also, and\r\nduring his childhood was brought every winter to escape the arctic\r\nclimate of St. Petersburg, with his governesses and tutors, and the\r\nrooms which he and his brothers occupied remain very much as they\r\nwere in those days. They open immediately off a small hallway in the\r\ncentre of the cottage on the ground floor, and the windows, which are\r\nonly breast high from the lawn, overlook the garden. They are small\r\nand cosy, but very plain. Boyish traps are still hanging on the walls;\r\ntennis rackets, fencing foils and masks and rubber-soled canvas shoes.\r\n\r\nThere is an ordinary hat rack, a table and two plain chairs in the\r\nentrance hall. Two or three hats that belonged to Alexander III still\r\nremain where he hung them when he wore them last. The children’s\r\nschoolroom and the bedrooms of the boys occupy one half of the ground\r\nfloor. On the opposite side is a dining-room, a very plain apartment,\r\nwith a polished floor and a rug and sideboards, carving tables,\r\nhigh-backed mahogany chairs and a table that will seat twenty.\r\n\r\nBack of the dining-room is the kitchen, and over it, on the second\r\nfloor, is the drawing-room with handsome and tasteful but inexpensive\r\nfurniture. There is a grand piano, a Swiss music box, upon a stand\r\nin the corner; a collection of fans and other feminine trifles in a\r\ncabinet; several presentation books and albums, and rather ordinary\r\npaintings upon the walls.\r\n\r\nThere is a suite of three rooms for the emperor and a corresponding\r\nsuite for the empress. Her sitting-room is very pretty, with a Brussels\r\ncarpet on the floor and hangings and upholstery of cretonne. Her\r\nbedroom is furnished with the same material and is similar to those\r\nyou can find in every country-house of well-to-do people and much more\r\nconvenient than any palace apartment I have ever seen. The bedstead\r\nis of brass with a canopy and curtains of cretonne. Between the\r\nsitting-room and the bedroom is a dressing-room, with several large\r\nwardrobes and a storeroom for linen with chests of drawers.\r\n\r\nThe czar’s library contains two desks of plain, ordinary white oak, one\r\nfor himself and one for his secretary or military aide. It is furnished\r\nwith substantial leather tufted furniture, cretonne hangings and an\r\nordinary Brussels carpet upon the floor, while the walls are hung with\r\nfamily photographs, including a group taken on the front porch of the\r\ncottage when the late King Christian, Queen Alexandra of England, King\r\nGeorge of Greece and other relatives of the Dowager Empress were there.\r\nThere are several photographs of Queen Alexandra of England and King\r\nGeorge of Greece about the house. The affection and devotion for which\r\nthe royal family of Denmark is famous is illustrated by the number of\r\nphotographs that are scattered around.\r\n\r\nThe czar’s sleeping chamber is a large, square room with an outlook\r\nupon the Black Sea. It is left exactly as it was when he died. His bed,\r\na large four-poster with two mattresses, is shielded from the light by\r\na high screen, and beside it is a small iron camp bedstead that was\r\nused by his nurse. In the corner is a cabinet bathtub, which closes up\r\nlike a settee; in the centre is a table, with several Russian books,\r\nreviews and newspapers--the last he read. There is a sofa behind it\r\nwith a pillow embroidered with the imperial arms, where he rested in\r\nhis last days. Beside one window is a large easy chair, in tufted blue\r\nleather, much worn, and rather shabby, in which Alexander III sat when\r\nhe breathed his last. He died of a combination of Bright’s disease and\r\ndropsy, and his lungs and heart were drowned. For several days before\r\nhis death he was unable to lie down, and slept in this chair. It stands\r\nexactly where it was when he died, and where his feet rested a cross of\r\nolive-wood has been embedded in the floor.\r\n\r\nThe rooms of Alexander II in the winter palace at St. Petersburg and\r\nthose of Nicholas I, the iron czar, are preserved in the same way, and\r\nwill never be occupied again. But no emperor ever died in such simple,\r\nhomelike surroundings as Alexander III.\r\n\r\nThe widow has never been there since she left for St. Petersburg\r\nwith the funeral cortege, but Nicholas II, the son, always spends a\r\nportion of the year in Livadia, usually three months in the fall. The\r\nold vine-covered villa, which has been photographed and used as an\r\nillustration for books and magazines so often, has been torn down,\r\nand a splendid palace of white sandstone, to cost $750,000, has been\r\nconstructed on plans prepared by Architect Krasnoff of Yalta.\r\n\r\nThere are 700 acres in the estate, 250 acres under cultivation and the\r\nrest in park. Nearly 200 acres are in vineyards, and the best wine of\r\nthe Crimea is said to come from the emperor’s grapes. It is not\r\nmade on the place, but the grapes are hauled to a wine press in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Villa at Livadia in which Alexander III died]\r\n\r\nThe estate is surrounded by a high barbed-wire fence, draped with\r\nhoneysuckle and creepers. It lies between the main highway and the\r\nBlack Sea, and people who drive that way can get a very good idea of\r\nthe establishment--the groups of stables, the cottages for aide-de-camp\r\nand members of the household, the conservatories, the chapel, and other\r\nbuildings which are scattered over the place, and half hidden in the\r\nfoliage. There is an especial residence for the cabinet minister, who\r\nattends the czar, and apartments for the entertainment of other members\r\nof the government who are brought here on official business. Nothing,\r\nhowever, is pretentious. Many summer homes in the United States surpass\r\nit in every respect, but Livadia will always be sacred to Russians\r\nbecause of its associations with Alexander III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSEVASTOPOL AND BALAKLAVA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Crimea was annexed to Russia in 1783, Prince Potemkin\r\nrecognized the natural strength and military advantages of a village\r\ncalled Ak-yar and the marine advantages of its harbour, which is a\r\nnarrow, deep fiord, extending inward several miles between low hills.\r\nA few weeks after the treaty was signed which gave Russia sovereignty\r\nover the peninsula, Catherine the Great, upon his recommendation,\r\nissued an edict directing the creation of a military and naval station\r\nand a fortress at that point.\r\n\r\nShe passed two days here in 1787 and rechristened the place with\r\na combination of two Greek words: Sevastos-polis, which means, in\r\nEnglish, “honoured” or “august city.” From that time Sevastopol (it\r\nis pronounced Sevas-tow-pol--with the accent on the “tow”--) next to\r\nCronstadt, the Gibraltar of the north, has been the most strongly\r\nfortified place in Russia, the military and naval headquarters of the\r\nBlack Sea, with a shipyard for the construction of vessels, shops for\r\nthe manufacture of guns, engines, and other machinery and equipment,\r\nboth military and naval; and the natural advantages have been improved\r\nwith such skill and expense as to make the finest and best equipped\r\nmilitary harbour in Europe. Sevastopol is purely a military town. Every\r\nresident is either connected with the army or navy, or is dependent\r\nupon one or the other branches of that service.\r\n\r\nThe city was almost entirely destroyed during the Crimean war, but was\r\nimmediately rebuilt and made stronger than ever. The Crimean war was\r\nthe result of the intervention of Great Britain, France, and Sardinia\r\nfor the protection of Turkey against the aggressive movements of\r\nRussia, which insisted upon a treaty with the sultan giving the czar\r\nthe protectorate over all members of the Greek Church in his dominion,\r\nwho comprise about three fourths of the population of Turkey in Europe.\r\nThis claim could not be conceded by Turkey without ceasing to remain\r\nan independent state, and war was declared against Russia in March,\r\n1854. England and France sent fleets and armies to support Turkey and\r\na campaign was fought on the Danube to resist the Russian invasion.\r\nFleets of transports, loaded with Sardinians, French, and British\r\ntroops were sent to the Black Sea, through the Bosphorus, and landed at\r\nVarna, which is now the port of Bulgaria, in April and May, 1854, but\r\ncholera broke out there, and in September following, an army of 25,000\r\nBritish, 25,000 French, and 8,000 Turks was transferred to the Crimea,\r\nand disembarked thirty miles north of Sevastopol, where they fought the\r\nbattle of Alam and commenced the siege of Sevastopol.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Balaklava followed on the 25th of October and that of\r\nInkerman on the 5th of November. Inkerman was known as the soldiers’\r\nbattle, because of the absence of officers of high rank. The British\r\ncamp was surprised by the Russians on a dark and drizzly morning when\r\nmost of the officers were absent, and the soldiers sustained a hand to\r\nhand fight against five times their number of Russians until 6,000\r\nFrench came to their aid and completed the rout of the enemy.\r\n\r\nBalaklava was one of the fiercest battles ever fought and will be ever\r\nremembered for the charge of the Light Brigade. No more spectacular\r\nexhibition of nerve and courage was ever witnessed, and the act was\r\nperformed before an audience of 50,000 men. The charge of Pickett’s\r\ndivision of the confederate army at the battle of Gettysburg was made\r\nby several times the number of men and was repeated again and again\r\neach time they were driven back. For desperate tenacity of purpose\r\nand heroic determination, the charge of the First Minnesota infantry\r\nat Gettysburg is more notable, but for dramatic effect nothing could\r\nexceed the charge of the 600--or in reality 723--English cavalrymen,\r\nwho in obedience to a mistaken order, rode a mile and a half between\r\ntwo Russian lines, under a murderous fire of musketry to silence a\r\nbattery that had been seriously harassing the British position.\r\n\r\nThe British forces suffered severely in the campaign, more than the\r\nFrench or the Sardinians, and almost as much as the Russians. The Turks\r\nsuffered least of all, notwithstanding the fact that the war was fought\r\nin their behalf. They were an insignificant factor in the struggle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grafskaya Pristan--Monumental Landing Place, Sevastopol]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Memorial Church, Sevastopol]\r\n\r\nThe war was famous for two of the most notable events in military\r\nhistory--the siege of Sevastopol and the charge of the Light Brigade.\r\nThe siege lasted thirteen months, until the Russians were absolutely\r\nstarved out. They have always asserted that with food they might have\r\nresisted forever. The city was assaulted four times “with infernal\r\nfire,” and an appalling sacrifice of life, without making much\r\nimpression. It was not the assaults that brought Sevastopol down,\r\nbut the persistence of the siege. Military critics have often said that\r\nit was a war of spades and not of guns. The entrenchments of the allies\r\nwere gradually advanced until the city was like a body of men wrapped\r\nin the coils of an anaconda. The situation being no longer tenable, as\r\nsoldiers say, the Russians spiked their guns, blew up their magazines\r\nand fortifications, burned their storehouses, sunk every floating thing\r\nin the harbour, and evacuated, Sept. 10, 1855, having lost in the\r\nsiege, according to their own accounts, 2,684 killed, 7,342 wounded,\r\nand 1,763 missing. The Russian losses in the several battles which\r\npreceded the siege were more than 30,000 killed and wounded. The French\r\ncemetery contains 28,000 graves, most of them marked.\r\n\r\nAfter the Russians retired, the allies took possession of the ruins of\r\nthe city and remained until peace was declared.\r\n\r\nThe English losses were placed at 30,000. The unusual severity of the\r\nwinter, the lack of food, clothing, blankets, medicines, and other\r\nnecessaries caused terrible hardship and suffering, and more than\r\n18,000 British soldiers died of disease, which is ten times as many as\r\nwere killed in battle during the entire campaign.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the British army in the Crimea was the same that\r\nappeared in the South African war fifty years later; the same that\r\nprevailed on the part of the United States during our recent war with\r\nSpain, a condition that military students are always warning each\r\nother against, but seldom providing for. Although England went into\r\nthe war voluntarily, intervening for the protection of Turkey in an\r\naffair which was of no direct interest to the government or the people\r\nof Great Britain, both the army and the navy, in every department,\r\nwere totally unprepared. Upon the arrival of the troops at the Crimea,\r\nthey were absolutely without necessary supplies of food, clothing,\r\nammunition, and indeed practically everything else. The medical\r\ndepartment was without drugs, instruments, litters, and all other\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Evelyn Wood, in his history of the Crimean War, says:\r\n\r\n“The neglect of all preparation for war during the forty years of peace\r\nforedoomed the gallant army which left England in 1854, and general\r\nmismanagement led it to the verge of annihilation. England’s futility\r\ncost her dear in treasure, reputation, in blood; but the victims of\r\nher short-sighted parsimony sustained the honour of Englishmen, and\r\nwith ragged clothes, muddy tents, and empty stomachs enriched the best\r\ntraditions of the service, past and to come.”\r\n\r\nTo make bad matters worse, a gale of unprecedented fury struck the\r\nBritish fleet lying outside the little harbour of Balaklava and wrecked\r\ntwenty-one vessels, including the _Resolute_, a frigate, several loaded\r\ntransports, and a magazine ship laden with 10,000,000 rounds of rifle\r\nand gun ammunition. General Wood says:\r\n\r\n“She had been sent outside the harbour after the battle of Balaklava,\r\nwhen we were apprehensive for the safety of the place. The _Prince_,\r\none of our largest transports, went down laden with warm clothing and\r\nstores of all descriptions. It was, however, as unreasonable as it was\r\nunjust to attempt to fasten the blame for the helpless muddle which\r\nensued on those in the Crimea. It was caused mainly by the neglect to\r\nmaintain the departments of the army during forty years of peace. It\r\nwas easy to criticise the conduct of our generals, but it should be\r\nremembered that the government by very decided instructions had urged\r\nthem on to the undertaking of a great task with inadequate means.”\r\n\r\nDuring the winter following the evacuation, Nicholas, the iron czar,\r\nwhose ambition to emulate Peter the Great and Catherine II, the most\r\nfamous of his ancestors, was the cause of the war, died. His brother,\r\nAlexander II, a man of less determination and greater humanity, sought\r\nthe intervention of Austria, and peace was arranged Feb. 26, 1856.\r\nA treaty was signed at Paris a few weeks later by all the powers of\r\nEurope, in which the integrity and territory of the Ottoman Empire\r\nwere guaranteed. Russia was compelled to agree to abandon Sevastopol\r\nas a military and naval station, not to fortify her coast, nor keep\r\nmore than six gunboats of a maximum of 800 tons each on the Black Sea.\r\nThese pledges, made under pressure, were repudiated by Russia as soon\r\nas she was strong enough to do so. Sevastopol was not only strengthened\r\nin its fortifications, but reinforced by a large fleet of battleships\r\nand cruisers, and finally in 1876–77 the efforts of Alexander II to\r\ndrive the Turk out of Europe and emancipate Bulgaria, Rumelia, Bosnia,\r\nServia, Hertzegovia and Montenegro caused another war which was more\r\nsuccessful than that of the Crimea, and added much territory to the\r\nRussian Empire and won much prestige for the Russian armies.\r\n\r\nSevastopol is to-day stronger than ever, the headquarters of a large\r\narmy and a large fleet of battle ships, cruisers, torpedo boats,\r\nsubmarines and destroyers. New barracks are being erected, the\r\nmachine-shops and arsenals have been refitted with modern machinery,\r\nand Russia is preparing for any opportunity that may offer to recover\r\nthe prestige she lost in the late war with Japan. The little city of\r\nSevastopol, which has about forty thousand inhabitants, occupies a very\r\npicturesque situation upon a low promontory or hog’s back, as such\r\nformations are usually called, about one hundred and fifty feet high in\r\nthe centre, and sloping gradually to the water on both sides. Viewed\r\nfrom the sea the city looks much larger than it is, and the white walls\r\nof the buildings glisten in the sun. On one shore is an estuary given\r\nup to commerce. On the other side of the ridge is the naval harbour, or\r\ninner bay, with a narrow entrance, defended by two old-fashioned forts\r\nwith square portholes, like those in the harbour of New York. The outer\r\nbay is also strongly fortified, but the batteries are modern and are\r\nmasked, and it is difficult for a stranger to identify them.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the War of 1855 the entrance to the harbour was\r\nblockaded in the same way that Hobson tried to bottle up Santiago de\r\nCuba. The Russians had a large fleet of rotten old wooden ships. They\r\nwere quite as good as any the Turks had, and Russia did not anticipate\r\nthe intervention of England and France, whose men-of-war were very\r\npowerful in comparison. The Russian Admiral Kazarsky, in command of\r\nthe Russian ships, proposed to attack the British ships whether or\r\nno, grapple them, blow them up and go down with them, but the Russian\r\nauthorities would not permit such a sacrifice of human life as the\r\nscheme involved. So it was decided to use the hulls for defensive\r\nrather than offensive purposes, and the entire fleet of the czar\r\nwas scuttled and sunk at the entrance of the harbor of Sevastopol.\r\nProvidence took care of the British fleet and sent a storm which\r\nwrecked twenty-one of the vessels off the entrance to the little\r\nharbour of Balaklava.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the harbour from the town is the naval\r\nstation, reached by ferry boats which cross every few minutes. Immense\r\nbuildings--barracks for sailors and marines, hospitals, machine-shops,\r\narsenals, warehouses, sail lofts, and other structures--cover an\r\narea of several hundred acres and extend up the side of the harbour\r\ninto the hills which surround the city on the north. There are tall\r\nsmokestacks rising in the air, and long docks and piers running into\r\nthe water. The officers’ houses are quite attractive in their situation\r\nand appearance, and form a city of themselves. The commandant is also\r\nthe governor-general of the district, which seems a good idea, because\r\nin that way rivalry, controversy, and conflict of authority, such as\r\nconstantly occurs in India and other places that might be mentioned,\r\nis avoided. The present governor-general has a charming wife and\r\nfamily, who speak English perfectly, having lived for several years in\r\nLondon, where he was naval attaché of the Russian embassy. His official\r\nresidence is on the point of the promontory, in the centre of the town,\r\nwhere he can overlook everything and everybody.\r\n\r\nOn both shores of the harbour are dry docks, yards for the building of\r\nships, and long rows of obsolete gunboats and transports of ancient\r\ndesign. Near where the passenger steamers land is a yard for building\r\nsmaller craft and at present large gangs of men are at work upon long,\r\nnarrow torpedo boats, a dozen or more keels having been laid in a row.\r\n\r\nAt the passenger dock is a custom-house, fronting a large square,\r\nwith a park and a promenade, bathing-houses, an outdoor theatre,\r\nrestaurants, cafés, a skating rink, and a concert stand, where the band\r\nplays every afternoon and evening. The social life of the citizens\r\ncentres there during the summer months. Everybody comes out in the\r\nevening. Many families take their dinner there and entertain their\r\nfriends, and the scene is animated and enlivened by a large number of\r\narmy and navy officers in resplendent uniforms.\r\n\r\nThere is another park at the opposite end of the town, and a much\r\nlarger one, which was the site of the strongest fortifications during\r\nthe siege. Some of the old earthworks remain as relics, piles of\r\nsandbags, basket-work, and trenches. The rest have been levelled, the\r\nground has been planted with trees and laid off into walks, drives,\r\nand gardens. In the centre is a permanent building for the exhibition\r\nof a panorama of the siege, but the original picture has been removed\r\nto St. Petersburg and replaced with one representing the battle with\r\nCircassian cavalry during the invasion of Daghestan.\r\n\r\nThere are several imposing monuments also, the most notable being in\r\nhonour of General Todleben, the engineer who designed and constructed\r\nthe defenses of the city at the time of the siege. He is regarded\r\nas the greatest hero of the war, and shortly after the recovery of\r\nSevastopol by Russians he was presented with a handsome residence on\r\nthe main street. It is now occupied for official purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the public square in front of the custom-house is a striking bronze\r\nfigure of Admiral Nazanikin, who captured two Turkish frigates with one\r\nsmall brig in the war of 1829.\r\n\r\nA little way up the street is a memorial church, erected to the memory\r\nof four admirals, Nakhimoff, Lazareff, Korniloff, and Istomin, all of\r\nwhom were conspicuous in the siege. Lazareff and Korniloff were both\r\nkilled at the battle of Malikoff Hill, near which the British cemetery\r\nis located. This hill is called after a warrant officer in the Russian\r\nnavy, who lived on the site of the cemetery and was the grandfather of\r\nthe famous French marshal of that name.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Lazareff was educated in England, held a commission as\r\nmidshipman in the British navy for several years, and served under Lord\r\nNelson at the battle of Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nThere are imposing statues located in various parts of the city to\r\nAdmirals Kornkioff and Nashkioff and several other heroes of the siege.\r\n\r\nThere is a memorial chapel for Prince Gorchakoff, commander-in-chief of\r\nthe Russian forces during the siege. He died in 1861 and was brought\r\nthere for burial at his own request.\r\n\r\nThere is a charming little museum of pure classic architecture,\r\ncontaining relics of the siege and of the men who were engaged upon the\r\nRussian side.\r\n\r\nEach nation has its own cemetery, in which the dead of the Crimean\r\nWar are buried. The Russian cemetery is the largest and occupies the\r\nslopes of a hill across the outer bay from the city. In the centre is a\r\npyramid of stone 105 feet high, erected by the government in honour of\r\nthe officers and soldiers who fell in the siege, and surrounding it are\r\nthe graves of 38,000 soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe French cemetery contains 28,000 graves, and the British cemetery\r\nonly about 1,800, nearly all of the bodies of the dead having been\r\ntaken back to England. Several famous men are resting there, including\r\nMajor-general Sir John Campbell, who, the inscription upon his\r\nmonument tells us, was killed in action, June 18, 1855. His brother,\r\nMajor-general Colin Campbell, was also conspicuous on the British side\r\nand afterward distinguished himself in the Indian Mutiny of 1857.\r\n\r\nSir George Cathcart, lieutenant-general, commanding the fourth\r\ndivision of the British army, was also killed in action. By a strange\r\ncoincidence, he had served in the Russian army against Napoleon in 1813\r\nand 1814, just as Admiral Lazareff had served with Nelson. Sir George\r\nCathcart was killed at the battle of Inkerman, wearing upon his breast\r\nthree decorations which had been bestowed upon him for bravery by the\r\nRussian czar when he was a young man.\r\n\r\nA cottage in which Lord Raglan, commander of the British forces, died,\r\noverlooks the battlefield of Balaklava. It was the headquarters of\r\nthe British army and was known as Vracker’s farmhouse, but it is now\r\noccupied and owned by a Russian named Maximovitch, who has a large\r\nvineyard. A sign on his gate reads: “Alpha Vineyard.”\r\n\r\nA stone slab under a tree in the garden marks the place where Lord\r\nRaglan used to sit in his last illness, brooding over the unjust\r\ncriticisms that were directed at his conduct of the campaign. In one of\r\nthe rooms is a tablet inscribed: “In this room died Field Marshal Lord\r\nRaglan, G. C. B., Commander in Chief of the British army of the Crimea,\r\n28th June, 1855.”\r\n\r\nOn the door of the house are the names of Raglan, Simpson, and\r\nCedrington, the three officers who commanded the British army during\r\nthe campaign.\r\n\r\nThe British have been more careful and more thoughtful in preserving\r\nthe remembrances of their share in the campaign than either of the\r\nother nations, and the cemetery and other spots identified with their\r\nmen are preserved in perfect order under the direction of Douglas\r\nYoung, the British consul, who also looks after American interests at\r\nSevastopol.\r\n\r\nA trolley line encircles the city of Sevastopol, and extends into the\r\nsuburbs, with open cars which are more comfortable than carriages,\r\nbecause of the rough stone pavements in the streets. There is a\r\nmilitary and naval club, many attractive shops, and several churches,\r\nincluding a replica of the Temple of Thesus at Athens.\r\n\r\nThere are several good hotels, the chief one being close to the\r\npassenger landing. It is neat and well kept, and has an excellent cook,\r\nbut the charges are as high as those of the Waldorf-Astoria in New\r\nYork, or the Savoy in London, with petty extortions that exasperate\r\ntravellers, particularly Americans, to the limit of patience. No one\r\nobjects to a straight bill at so much per day, even if the total is\r\nexcessive, but when you are charged for candles and soap that you\r\ndon’t use, for the use of towels and the bed linen, for the ordinary\r\nstationery that is always supplied free elsewhere, and for the use of\r\nthe newspapers in the public reading-room, a righteous indignation is\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nThese impositions, which are common all over Russia, are merely a\r\ngamble. If a guest objects to them they are stricken off the bill;\r\nbut if he pays them without protest rather than make a row, as most\r\nAmericans do, the landlord is so much ahead. And what makes it more\r\naggravating than all is to realize that you are being purposely imposed\r\nupon simply to test your forbearance.\r\n\r\nThe battlefield of Balaklava is carpeted with flowers, and the poppies\r\nare so thick upon the meadow where the charge of the Light Brigade was\r\nmade that it looks like a field of blood. There are patches of purple\r\nflowers whose name I do not know, and the road which winds around\r\nthe battlefield has a hedge of sweetbriar roses, which are covered\r\nwith pink blossoms. You cannot imagine a more peaceful landscape\r\nthan the gentle slope of that beautiful valley, lying between two\r\nlow ridges, which on the morning of Oct. 25, 1855, was covered with\r\n40,000 spectators--Englishmen, Frenchmen, Russians, Sardinians, and\r\nTurks, involuntary and astonished witnesses of one of the most reckless\r\nexhibitions of human courage ever seen, and one of the most useless\r\nsacrifices of human life. No arena could have been arranged for a\r\nbetter view of the spectacle. And to-day the landscape is precisely\r\nas it was then, except that the valley is now dotted with several\r\nfarmhouses surrounded by groves of locust and shrubbery and a Chicago\r\nwindmill stands in the centre.\r\n\r\nThe spot where the dragoons started, where Earl Cardigan, the impetuous\r\nyoung Irishman, who commanded the Light Brigade, gave his one and only\r\nword of command during the charge, is marked by a marble shaft and the\r\npedestal is inscribed:\r\n\r\n“Erected by the British army to the memory of their comrades who fell\r\nat Balaklava.”\r\n\r\nThat word of command was: “Left wheel into line! Forward, march!” Not a\r\nword was spoken after that.\r\n\r\nWhere stood the battery which was the object of assault is now a cherry\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nWater is very scarce upon the battlefield of Balaklava; all the farmers\r\nhave is pumped up by the Chicago windmill, and hauled in casks to the\r\nneighbouring houses. Every drop used to water the English cemetery is\r\nhauled half a mile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The village of Balaklava]\r\n\r\nThere were two splendid cavalry charges at the battle of Balaklava, one\r\nby 300 heavy dragoons under command of Major-general Scarlett and the\r\nother by the light cavalry under command of the Earl of Cardigan. The\r\nformer, from a military standpoint, was remarkably successful, because\r\nthree squadrons of Englishmen surprised, demoralized, and practically\r\nput to rout two brigades of Russian cavalry, numbering nearly three\r\nthousand men. The latter, although one of the most spectacular displays\r\nof human daring in all history, was of comparatively no effect and was\r\nthe result of a misunderstanding of orders.\r\n\r\nThe scene of those two cavalry charges is a wide and beautiful valley\r\nbetween two low ridges about two miles south of the picturesque little\r\nport of Balaklava. The British troops had taken possession of the ridge\r\nnorth of this valley, were throwing up earthworks, and completing their\r\ncamp, when, on the evening of Oct. 24, 1855, Rustem Pasha, in command\r\nof the Turkish contingent, sent word to Lord Raglan, in command of the\r\nBritish troops, that the Russians were preparing for a surprise attack\r\nthe next morning. As there had been already more than one false alarm,\r\nLord Raglan contented himself with asking for an immediate report of\r\nany further news and no extra precautions were taken.\r\n\r\nShortly after daylight the next morning General Scarlett, with eight\r\nsquadrons of heavy dragoons, started out on a reconnoissance, and as he\r\npassed over the ridge came plump upon the flank of a brigade of Russian\r\ncavalry, about three thousand strong, which was advancing quietly\r\nupon the British position. Both forces were moving without scouts or\r\nflankers, and thus neither of the cavalry generals, whose men were\r\nsoon to be in close personal conflict, was aware of the movements\r\nof his adversary. When General Scarlett realized the situation he\r\nimmediately gave the command to charge and plunged directly into the\r\ncentre of the Russian line, which was only about two hundred yards\r\ndistant. But the order was heard by only three of the eight squadrons,\r\nthe other five having passed on the other side of a narrow vineyard.\r\nScarlett’s movement, however, was distinctly seen by the rest of the\r\narmy and the witnesses say that when the three troops of dragoons\r\ndashed into the Russian ranks they were entirely engulfed, but, with\r\ntheir sabers they hacked their way through with such impetuosity that\r\nin eight minutes they were entirely clear. The shock and the surprise\r\nthrew the Russian troops into such confusion that they practically fled\r\nfrom the field, pursued on both flanks by the other British troops.\r\n\r\nScarlett lost seventy-eight men in the charge. The Russians lost about\r\nsix hundred.\r\n\r\nDuring this extraordinary episode the Light Brigade, under the command\r\nof Earl Cardigan, remained motionless because the commander believed\r\nthat Lord Lucan, in command of the cavalry, had given him orders to\r\ndefend the position on which he stood against any attack, and on no\r\naccount to leave it.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Cardigan was an Irish peer, fifty-seven years old, rich,\r\nreckless and popular, notorious for his love affairs, famous as a\r\nsportsman and as a rider to hounds, resolute in purpose, a dare-devil\r\nwith a terrible temper, and entirely without military experience. He\r\nowed his rank and prominence in the army to the purchase system and to\r\nthe favour of the Duke of York, and although he had a passionate love\r\nfor military affairs, unfaltering courage and a strong sense of duty,\r\nhis inexperience alone would have unfitted him for any responsibility.\r\nHe had fought two duels. One of the quarrels was over the colour of a\r\nbottle; the other was over the size of a teacup. At the time of the\r\nfamous charge, although a brigade commander of troops in the field, he\r\nwas living on board a yacht in the harbour of Balaklava by permission\r\nof Lord Lucan, his brother-in-law, commander of the cavalry, while the\r\nofficers and men under him as well as his superiors, were cheerfully\r\nbearing the hardships and privations of camp life.\r\n\r\nThus the Earl of Cardigan had nothing to recommend him for his command\r\nbut his courage and horsemanship.\r\n\r\nThe Light Brigade had seen their comrades of the Heavy Dragoons achieve\r\none of the most brilliant cavalry victories ever recorded, and were\r\nnaturally impatient to emulate their example, when an order was brought\r\nto Lord Lucan by a young lieutenant, named Nolan, which read as follows:\r\n\r\n“Lord Raglan wishes the cavalry to advance rapidly to the front and try\r\nto prevent the enemy carrying away the guns. Troop of horse artillery\r\nmay accompany. The French cavalry is on your left. Immediate.”\r\n\r\nFrom the spot where Lord Lucan received this order no Russians were\r\nvisible, and he asked sharply:\r\n\r\n“Attack, sir! Attack what guns?”\r\n\r\nNolan replied with an insulting tone, pointing in an easterly direction:\r\n\r\n“There, My Lord, is your enemy, and there are your guns.”\r\n\r\nLord Lucan rode across to where the Light Brigade was impatiently\r\nwaiting, and communicated the order to Lord Cardigan, who gave the\r\ncommand and led his troops down the valley at a slow trot. Shortly\r\nafter the advance began, Nolan, the aide who had brought the order,\r\ngalloped across their front, shouting and pointing with his sword\r\ntoward a Russian battery in a hollow a mile and a half distant. Lord\r\nCardigan understood that Nolan was indicating the object of the charge,\r\nbut the latter was unable to give any further information, for he\r\nwas instantly struck by a shell which tore away his chest. His horse\r\ncontinued on a gallop and his body remained for some seconds erect in\r\nthe saddle.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the valley is as smooth as a race course; there is a\r\ngentle slope the entire distance, which is about a mile and a quarter,\r\nbut on the west and south sides were masses of Russian troops and in\r\nfront a battery of twelve guns, so that the brigade was subjected to\r\na cross fire of musketry and a direct fire of artillery the entire\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the entire movement lasted but twenty minutes, and\r\nthat Cardigan rode at the rate of seventeen miles an hour. His troops\r\nwere composed of the flower of the army, life guards, lancers, hussars,\r\nand light dragoons. Most of them were English and Irishmen, and several\r\nnoblemen were among the officers. The command kept its formation with\r\nremarkable skill, considering that so many of their comrades fell from\r\ntheir saddles, but nearly all the riderless horses maintained their\r\npositions until the battery was reached. The gunners were sabered,\r\nthe guns were turned upon their owners and the greater part of the\r\nsurvivors of the Light Brigade threw themselves furiously upon a line\r\nof Russian cavalry which was supporting the battery in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe French Chasseurs d’Afrique, which had observed the movement with\r\nastonishment, came to the rescue of the Englishmen, and the latter made\r\ntheir way back singly and in squads to headquarters.\r\n\r\nOut of 723 officers and men who followed the Earl of Cardigan down that\r\nvalley only 195 came back.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Evelyn Wood says: “It was a glorious failure, as the charge\r\nof the Heavy Dragoons was an astounding success, but Lord Tennyson’s\r\nenthusiastic pen blinded the public to the military value of the two\r\nexploits, and thus the determined gallantry shown in the attack of\r\nthe three squadrons of the heavy brigade has remained comparatively\r\nunappreciated.”\r\n\r\nOf course a controversy followed and it lasted for many years in\r\nthe war office, in the newspapers, in the clubs, in parliament, and\r\nwherever men and women talked of the war. Cardigan showed a manly\r\nspirit in the controversy as he had shown unparalleled bravery in\r\nleading the charge. He had never been under fire before. He had never\r\nhad the responsibility of actual command under serious conditions\r\nof any kind; he did not have the slightest knowledge of military\r\ntactics, and he admitted frankly that it did not occur to him that\r\nan unsupported movement of cavalry across an open field, a mile and\r\na quarter, exposed from two lines of the enemy, and in the face\r\nof a battery of twelve guns, was a feat absolutely impossible of\r\nperformance. He said he understood that his orders were to take that\r\nbattery and he took it. His reckless Irish courage saw no reason why he\r\nshould not do so.\r\n\r\nLord Lucan, in command of the cavalry, and who, as I have said, was\r\nCardigan’s brother-in-law, was utterly astounded when he saw how his\r\norders had been interpreted, and Lord Raglan, the commander-in-chief,\r\nwas paralyzed. The movement could be seen from start to finish by the\r\nentire army and the scarlet uniforms of the Light Brigade made it\r\npossible to watch man by man, as they plunged into the ranks of the\r\nRussians whose uniforms were gray.\r\n\r\nSifting the single grain of truth from the volume of argument and\r\nopinion, the charge of the Light Brigade was a blunder committed by an\r\nimpetuous Irishman who misunderstood his orders and whose inexperience\r\ndid not permit him to suspect a mistake.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bosquet, commander of the French contingent, who witnessed the\r\ncharge from the beginning to the end, turned to Colonel Layard of the\r\nBritish army and remarked:\r\n\r\n“_C’est magnifique; mais ce n’est pas la guerre._” (It is magnificent;\r\nbut it is not war.)\r\n\r\nLord Tennyson and time have sanctified the blunder and, notwithstanding\r\nthe folly of the act and the awful wastage of heroic blood, the charge\r\nof the Light Brigade stands unparalleled as an exhibition of soldierly\r\ndiscipline and daring. Not a man faltered in the ranks, not a man\r\nhesitated to enter “the jaws of death” and “the mouth of hell,” as\r\nordered, although every experienced private in the ranks must have\r\nrealized that “some one had blundered.” But it was a case of “Theirs\r\nnot to reason why; theirs but to do and die,” and they rode down the\r\nlong valley with the same coolness and alignment that they would have\r\nkept on the parade ground.\r\n\r\n     “When can their glory fade?\r\n      Oh the wild charge they made!\r\n          All the world wonder’d.\r\n      Honour the charge made,\r\n      Honour the Light Brigade\r\n          Noble six hundred!”\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale is the immortal, as she was the most interesting\r\nfigure of the Crimean war, and every school child knows her name.\r\nMillions of people throughout the world recognized her as “the Angel of\r\nthe Crimea,” although they have never heard the name of the commander\r\nof the Light Brigade or the names of the generals-in-chief of either\r\narmy. And I do not believe that one man or woman out of a thousand\r\nto-day can tell who commanded the British troops or the French allies;\r\nI doubt if one in ten thousand could give the name of the Russian\r\ngeneral commander-in-chief; but the fame of Florence Nightingale is\r\nuniversal. She was the first woman to take up professional nursing;\r\nthe first to follow an army into action, to nurse the sick and to bind\r\nup the wounds of the fallen. She was the only woman who ever received\r\nthe Order of Merit of Great Britain, the most exclusive and highly\r\nprized decoration, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, that can\r\nbe bestowed by the king of England. The membership of the order is\r\nlimited to twenty-four and includes such men as Earl Roberts, Lord\r\nKitchener, John Morley, James Bryce, Lord Kelvin, George Meredith, and\r\nSir Lawrence Alma-Tadema.\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale died Aug. 14, 1910, at the advanced age of\r\nninety years three months and two days. She lived at Chelsea, one\r\nof the outlying parishes of London, and although her body showed the\r\ninfirmities of age, her mind was as bright and her sympathies as\r\nactive as they were when she won the title of “Angel of the Crimea” in\r\n1855–56.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nFLORENCE NIGHTINGALE AND HER WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September, 1854, after the battle of Alma, the English newspapers\r\nwere filled with complaints and protests concerning the treatment of\r\nthe sick and the wounded in the Crimea, and Sir Robert Peel started\r\na relief fund which amounted to nearly $60,000. Lord Sidney Herbert,\r\nsecretary of war, asked Florence Nightingale if she would go to Turkey\r\nwith a party of nurses and carry out the scheme of relief proposed by\r\nthe contributors to the fund. It is a singular fact that his letter\r\nwas crossed in the mails by one from Miss Nightingale volunteering\r\nher services, not as a leader or director of the movement, but as an\r\nordinary nurse.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was then a little more than thirty-four years old. She\r\nwas the youngest daughter of William Shore Nightingale, a descendant\r\nof a famous old Derbyshire family of considerable wealth, and her\r\nmother was the daughter of William Smith, a practical philanthropist,\r\nan associate of Wilberforce in the abolition of slavery, in prison\r\nreforms, and similar movements, and for many years a member of the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was born in Florence, Italy, May 12, 1820; hence her\r\nname. From early childhood, she had been associated with philanthropic\r\nmovements in which her father and grandfather were engaged, and\r\nnatural inclination as well as deep sympathy with distress led her\r\nto give her entire time to benevolent work instead of seeking social\r\nenjoyment and distinction. During her girlhood she had been thoroughly\r\neducated, was familiar with the classics and modern languages, and was\r\none of the first women anywhere to take up the study of medicine.\r\n\r\nShe gained practical experience in the hospitals of London, Dublin, and\r\nEdinburgh, spent three years with the Sœurs de Charité at Paris, in\r\nthe Institute of Protestant Deaconesses at Kaiserworth on the Rhine,\r\nand in the hospitals at Berlin and Brussels, and in 1850, upon her\r\nreturn to England, had undertaken the management of a home for sick\r\ngovernesses in London. She was also engaged with Sir Robert Raikes in\r\norganizing “ragged schools” and in segregating diseased children who\r\nattended them. In the meantime she had established a training school\r\nfor nurses--the first in England.\r\n\r\nShe thus had ten years of preparation for the work she was called\r\nto perform in the Crimea, and within ten days after receiving her\r\ninvitation from the secretary of war, was on her way to Constantinople\r\nwith a staff of thirty-eight trained nurses, including fourteen\r\nAnglican Sisters and ten Roman Catholic Sisters of Mercy. All of them\r\nwere volunteers and among them were three ladies of noble families.\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival at Constantinople, Miss Nightingale and her nurses\r\nat once took charge of the hospitals at Scutari, the suburb which\r\noccupies the opposite bank of the Bosphorus, and there they found\r\n3,000 diseased and wounded Englishmen lying on the ground, without\r\nany comforts, and lacking actual necessities. They had no proper\r\nfood or medical attendance, and the few surgeons who were trying to\r\nrelieve their distress were without instruments or drugs or bandages,\r\nor even the commonest medical supplies. Hundreds died from sheer\r\nexhaustion, from lack of nourishment and ordinary attention, and as\r\nMiss Nightingale herself described the scene: “Neglect, mismanagement\r\nand disease had united to render the situation one of unparalleled\r\nhideousness.”\r\n\r\nWithin a few days Miss Nightingale had in operation a kitchen capable\r\nof feeding eight hundred men daily, and a laundry which was ample to\r\nwash the linen that had never been changed until she came. With a\r\ndaring that few men would have shown, she ordered warehouses broken\r\nopen by force and confiscated supplies that were needed by her\r\npatients. Her courage, her zeal, and her determination brought order\r\nout of chaos, and a few weeks after her arrival the hospitals at\r\nScutari were in excellent condition.\r\n\r\nAs is usual in such cases, Miss Nightingale was the continual object of\r\nattack from malicious, jealous, and uncharitable people. But this made\r\nno difference in her work or her influence, and when she received an\r\nautograph letter from Queen Victoria conveying her congratulations and\r\nexpressions of gratitude and sympathy she felt sure of her position.\r\n\r\nMore nurses kept coming from England, and several other hospitals\r\nwere established on the Bosphorus. Then Miss Nightingale went to the\r\nCrimea and organized at Balaklava and vicinity the work I have already\r\ndescribed. In addition to hospitals, she established a series of\r\nreading tents and recreation huts for the diversion of the soldiers,\r\nand sent to England for books, periodicals, and newspapers. She set\r\nup neat coffee houses as a counter attraction to the liquor saloons;\r\nshe started lecture courses, opened school-rooms, and upon her own\r\nresponsibility founded a bank where the soldiers could deposit their\r\npay and secure money orders for transmission home. More than $350,000\r\npassed through her hands in that way before the end of the war.\r\n\r\nAfter the evacuation of the Crimea by the British troops, Florence\r\nNightingale returned to England. Her last act in the Crimea was the\r\ndedication of a cross, twenty feet high, upon the crest of a crag\r\noverlooking her hospital. The only inscription was these words:\r\n\r\n                      LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US\r\n\r\nUpon her return to England, Miss Nightingale received from Queen\r\nVictoria a beautiful jewel designed by Prince Albert, accompanied by\r\nan autograph letter; the sultan of Turkey sent her a diamond bracelet,\r\nvalued at $100,000, and she was overwhelmed with gifts, testimonials,\r\nand tributes of every sort from municipalities, corporations,\r\nbenevolent societies, religious associations, and individuals. A\r\nfund in cash, amounting to about $240,000, raised as a gift to her,\r\nwas at her request devoted to the establishment of a training school\r\nfor nurses at St. Thomas’s Hospital. She was a guest of the queen at\r\nBalmoral, she received the “freedom of the city” from nearly every\r\ntown of importance in England, and was honoured in every possible way\r\nby every class of people, from royalty to the clubs of workingmen and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nShe was the only woman who ever received the Order of Merit; she was\r\nthe only woman who was ever made a member of the Order of St. John of\r\nJerusalem; Queen Victoria bestowed upon her the Red Cross; the city of\r\nLondon conferred upon her “the freedom of the city,” an honour enjoyed\r\nby only one other woman--the late Baroness Burdette-Coutts. For twenty\r\nyears or more her birthday has always been recognized by an autograph\r\nletter of congratulations from the queen or the king of England, and by\r\nresolutions of congratulations from numerous organizations throughout\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nShe celebrated her ninetieth birthday on May 12, 1910, and one of the\r\nfirst acts of King George V, who came to the throne only a few days\r\npreviously, was to send her a telegram of congratulation.\r\n\r\nAfter her return from the Crimea, Miss Nightingale was engaged for\r\nseveral years, under the direction of the secretary of state for war,\r\nin reorganizing the military hospital service of Great Britain. Her\r\ninstructions and rules in regard to army nursing, which fill a large\r\nvolume, prepared at the request of the war office, have been the basis\r\nof reforms throughout the world. They were of special importance during\r\nthe Civil War in the United States and the war between France and\r\nGermany which followed shortly after, and led to the founding of the\r\nRed Cross Society, now established in every civilized country.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale did not confine her work to the military service, but\r\ndirected and assisted the organization of training schools for nurses\r\nin all the principal cities of Great Britain and the establishment of\r\ndistrict nursing associations for outdoor relief among the poor. Her\r\ntheory had always been that hospitals should be reserved for surgical\r\ncases and infectious or contagious diseases and that, so far as\r\npossible, the indigent sick should be treated in their own homes.\r\n\r\nShe reorganized the infirmaries connected with workhouses and\r\nalmshouses throughout Great Britain, and through her influence acts\r\nof Parliament were passed making compulsory the employment of trained\r\nnurses in these institutions instead of women paupers to whose tender\r\nmercies the care of the sick had always been committed.\r\n\r\nDuring all this activity, Miss Nightingale found time to write a series\r\nof books of instruction, and many pamphlets and papers concerning\r\npublic health and the efficiency of hospital administration. In 1858,\r\nshe published a book on hospital construction. In 1860, her “Notes on\r\nNursing,” a volume of five hundred pages, ran up to an edition of one\r\nhundred thousand copies. Other publications on similar subjects came\r\nfrom her pen with extraordinary frequency.\r\n\r\nBut at last her frail constitution broke down under this labour and\r\nresponsibility. She became a helpless invalid, confined to her bed for\r\nmore than twenty-five years, yet she continued to devote her entire\r\ntime to “doing good work--work after my own heart, and, I trust, God’s\r\nwork.” From her pillow she continued to direct several institutions\r\nand movements in which she was particularly interested. The meetings\r\nof boards of directors and trustees of a dozen benevolent institutions\r\nwere held regularly in her bedroom, and her judgment was regarded of\r\nthe highest value on all subjects relating to hospital management and\r\nbenevolent work. Even up to the last month of her life she continued\r\nto receive reports and to give instructions, to write communications to\r\nthe government authorities and to give advice upon various subjects,\r\nand it was not until forty-eight hours before her death that she was\r\nconsidered dangerously ill.\r\n\r\nThere never was a more useful woman than Florence Nightingale, and\r\nnever one more honoured and revered throughout the world. Therefore\r\nthere was a universal demand in England that she should be honoured\r\nwith a burial and a monument in Westminster Abbey, and when the\r\nexecutors of her estate who were in charge of the funeral refused an\r\noffer from the dean and chapter, there was great surprise. It afterward\r\nappeared that Miss Nightingale had given the following directions in\r\nher will:\r\n\r\n“I give my body for dissection or _post-mortem_ examination for the\r\npurposes of medical science, and I request that the directions about my\r\nfuneral given by me to my uncle, the late Samuel Smith, be observed.\r\nMy original request was that no memorial whatever should mark the\r\nplace where lies my ‘mortal coil.’ I much desire this, but should the\r\nexpression of such wish render invalid my other wishes, I limit myself\r\nto the above-mentioned directions, praying that my body may be carried\r\nto the nearest convenient burial ground, accompanied by not more than\r\ntwo persons without trappings, and that a simple cross with only my\r\ninitials, date of birth and of death, mark the spot.”\r\n\r\nBalaklava, which was the scene of Miss Nightingale’s usefulness, is\r\nan ancient village of Greek fishermen, whose ancestors settled on the\r\nsouthern shores of the Crimea at least three thousand years ago, to\r\ncatch the unusually large variety of fish in which that section of the\r\nBlack Sea abounds. Balaklava is the source of a large portion of the\r\nsupply of the eggs of the pilchard, the most popular of caviars among\r\nRussian epicures. The name Balaklava is a composition of “bella” and\r\n“klava,” which means “fine port,” although the bay is no larger than\r\na Norwegian fiord, and is set like a sapphire between two emerald\r\nmountains. The entrance is as crooked as the letter S and very narrow.\r\nBalaklava is also an unfashionable summer resort, a retreat for tired\r\npeople, who wish to escape society and who are not fond of style. There\r\nare three or four unpretentious hotels, two or three beautiful villas,\r\nand every fisher-wife takes boarders. There are bathing houses, a\r\nhydropathic sanitarium, and on the mountain side among the vineyards a\r\n“grape cure” establishment, which at the height of the fad was largely\r\npatronized.\r\n\r\nThere is only one street in the village and houses on only one side\r\nof that. Every citizen, therefore, has the benefit of an exquisite\r\nview. There are a few small shops and cafés and two pavilions where\r\nvisitors can sit and sip their tea and look over the waters. The view\r\nis fascinating and the effect is heightened by the miniature character\r\nof the place--the bay is so tiny, the village so small, and the cliffs\r\nwhich enclose them are so high and bold and rugged.\r\n\r\nA walk over the cliffs leads to the ruins of a castle and fortress\r\nbuilt by the Genoese in the Middle Ages on the summit to command the\r\nharbour. Only a portion of the walls remain. The castle, or citadel,\r\nwas the apex of a triangular fortification, the base of which was\r\nparallel to the port, and there was a strong tower at each corner.\r\nThe Genoese were in possession of this part of the coast for several\r\ncenturies and made Balaklava a stronghold. A graphic description of\r\nthe place was written by a Russian merchant named Nikitin, who stopped\r\nhere in 1472 on his return from a trip to India, but a thousand years\r\nprevious Balaklava was described by Strabo and other Greek writers when\r\nit was known as “the calm port of the signals.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Nightingale’s seat,” on the hillside overlooking the village,\r\nis a group of rocks where she used to go for rest and thought, and\r\nbeside it are the graves of a few of her brave nurses. Every house in\r\nwhich she slept, every place in the vicinity that is associated with\r\nher in any way is hallowed. The present owners are as proud of that\r\ndistinction as owners of English castles are of the rooms in which\r\nQueen Elizabeth slept. Her principal hospital was at the monastery of\r\nSt. George, said to be the oldest and one of the largest in Russia.\r\nMost of the monks fled on the approach of the allies, and the British\r\nseized the buildings for hospital purposes and placed them under Miss\r\nNightingale’s charge. The room she occupied is sacred and is shown to\r\nall visitors with great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe monastery was built in the latter part of the ninth century,\r\nsomewhere about the year 890, by certain Greek merchants who were\r\nmiraculously saved during a fearful storm by the intercession of St.\r\nGeorge. It occupies an extraordinary position at the top of a cliff,\r\nseveral hundred feet above the sea, in the midst of an amphitheatre of\r\nblack basaltic rock, which rises to the height of one thousand feet\r\non both sides and in the rear. The amphitheatre is entered through\r\na tunnel cut in the rocks, no doubt by the ancient troglodytes,\r\nwhose remains are found in the neighbourhood. Tradition says that\r\nthis amphitheatre was the site of a temple and altar to the goddess\r\nIphigenia, daughter of Agamemnon, and here were sacrificed all\r\nstrangers and castaways that the Tauri found upon their coast.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting remains of the troglodytes are found in cliffs\r\noverhanging a little stream at Inkerman, where another fierce battle\r\nwas fought during the Crimean war. The Russians have erected a monument\r\nin the field where most of the fighting was done, and a granite shaft\r\nmarks the centre of the English camp, which is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                 In memory of the English, French\r\n               and Russian soldiers who fell in the\r\n                 battle of Inkerman, Nov. 5, 1854.\r\n\r\n                 Erected by the British Army, 1856\r\n\r\nThe battle of Inkerman was a surprise. The Russians crept up a ravine\r\nin the night and before daylight struck the sleeping Englishmen in\r\ntheir camp. It so happened that many of the officers were absent and in\r\nthe beginning every soldier fought independently for his life. After\r\nthe dawn, when there was light enough for the Englishmen to see what\r\nwas going on, the defence was thoroughly organized and the Russians\r\nwere driven back with a heavy loss.\r\n\r\nThe village of Inkerman occupies the head of the bay which forms the\r\nharbour of Sevastopol and is surrounded by the most noted quarries in\r\nsouthern Russia. They have been worked for ages, and vast chambers have\r\nbeen excavated in the soft limestone which underlies the scanty soil of\r\na high, dry, bare plateau. These chambers are entered through square\r\ndoorways cut in the cliffs and wooden tramways and skids are laid along\r\nthe floors of the galleries, so that the blocks of stone can be hauled\r\nout. It is as soft as chalk when first cut, but grows hard by exposure.\r\nOdessa, Sevastopol and other cities in southern Russia are built almost\r\nentirely of this material. At present the quarrymen are engaged in\r\ncutting out vast quantities of small blocks of stone for a new palace\r\nwhich the czar is building on his estate on the Crimean coast, near\r\nYalta.\r\n\r\nBoth walls of the gorge in which Inkerman sits are honeycombed\r\nwith artificial caves, supposed to have been the dwellings of the\r\ntroglodytes of mythology in prehistoric ages, and afterward the\r\nrefuge of the early Christians during the persecutions of the emperor\r\nJustinian. Some of the caves were converted into chapels and are used\r\nas such still. There is a monastery of twelve or fifteen monks entirely\r\nunderground, occupying the cliff dwellings of the troglodytes, and on\r\nthe opposite side of the gorge is a chapel that will accommodate a\r\nhundred and fifty or two hundred people, where service is held every\r\nSabbath and mass is sung every morning. In the vestibule are niches for\r\ncoffins, and only clean skeletons are lying in three open graves which\r\nwere chiselled out of the stone. They were uncovered only a few years\r\nago and are supposed to be the remains of early bishops or priests.\r\n\r\nPope Clement I was sentenced by the emperor Trajan of Rome, to hard\r\nlabour in these quarries and was brought here in the year 94 A.D. He\r\nwas afterward condemned to death for trying to convert the natives to\r\nChristianity and suffered martyrdom by being thrown from the cliffs\r\ninto the sea in the year 100. Until the ninth century, on each\r\nanniversary of his death, the sea receded from the shore for the space\r\nof seven days, leaving his petrified body exposed upon the sands, and\r\nmultitudes of pilgrims came here on these occasions to venerate him and\r\nto be relieved of deformities, disease, and distress. Pope Clement was\r\nsubsequently canonized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nODESSA--CAPITAL OF SOUTHERN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe crossed from Sevastopol to Odessa by steamer in about eighteen\r\nhours, stopping to discharge cargo and passengers at the ancient\r\nport of Eupatoria. The Greek name denotes the origin of that town,\r\nwhich flourished centuries before the Christian era, but is now of\r\ncomparative insignificance. In the morning we found ourselves in a\r\ncrowded harbour under a bluff 200 or 250 feet high, crowned with\r\nseveral monumental buildings and presenting a noble front to the sea.\r\nAt the extreme western end of the town, beyond the expanse of foliage\r\nof Alexander II Park, are the buildings of the industrial exposition,\r\nwhich is now in progress. Their fantastic forms are so white that they\r\nlook like the fancy ornaments with which confectioners decorate wedding\r\ncake.\r\n\r\nOdessa is comparatively a new town, being only a little more than a\r\nhundred years old, and entirely a Russian creation. The Turks had a\r\nfortress here called Khodja-bey, which was carried by assault in 1778\r\nby the Russian forces under General Ribas during the war with Turkey,\r\nwhich Catherine II provoked for conquest. The title to the property\r\nwas conveyed by the Great Turk to the czar of all the Russias by the\r\ntreaty of Jassy, December 29, 1791. It graciously pleased her imperial\r\nmajesty to utilize the natural advantages of the location for defence\r\nof commerce, and she ordered a town created here. General Ribas laid it\r\nout and built the first house, and her majesty, who was always fond of\r\nclassical names, commanded that it should be called Odessus, from the\r\nOdyssey of Homer, which mentions this place.\r\n\r\nIn 1803 the Duke de Richelieu, a refugee from the French Revolution,\r\nwho came to Russia and was given an important commission in the\r\narmy, was appointed governor. The population then numbered only a\r\nfew thousand, but his enterprise and taste made it a beautiful and\r\nimportant city. Upon his death, Count Woronzoff, afterward prince,\r\nto whom I have alluded several times in connection with the Crimea,\r\ntook up the work where Richelieu left it off, and proved himself a\r\nremarkable builder. He founded the university, the public library, the\r\nmuseum, the municipal opera house; and schools of medicine attached to\r\nthe hospitals were encouraged and subsidized by him. He gave an impetus\r\nto trade and commerce which lasted for half a century; he built roads\r\ninto the interior, dredged the harbour, created docks, and encouraged\r\nthe introduction of profitable industries.\r\n\r\nWoronzoff was born in St. Petersburg in 1782, and was the son of a\r\ndistinguished statesman. His father was ambassador to London during his\r\nboyhood, which caused him to be educated there, and he took a degree\r\nat Cambridge University. Returning to Russia he obtained a commission\r\nin the army and commenced his military career as a subaltern in a\r\nCaucasian regiment commanded by a famous Georgian, Prince Tzytzyanoff.\r\nHe proved a brilliant soldier, was promoted rapidly and wore the\r\nepaulets of a major general before he was thirty years old. In the\r\nwar with Napoleon he commanded a division of grenadiers and during the\r\nretreat of the French, followed closely upon their flank to the German\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the war he went to England and remained until\r\nhe was called by the emperor to undertake the organization of the\r\ngovernment of Bessarabia, and shortly after succeeded the Duke de\r\nRichelieu as governor of Odessa. He was afterward governor of the\r\nCaucasus and the Crimea, and in all three provinces his memory is\r\nrevered and many public works exist as monuments to his enterprise and\r\nforesightedness.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous object on the bluff that overlooks the harbour\r\nof Odessa is a mansion built by Prince Woronzoff and occupied by him\r\nfor many years. It is of classical design, with walls of granite,\r\nand is surrounded by limited but handsomely embellished grounds. The\r\nchief feature is a pergola of lofty granite columns reached from the\r\nhouse, and rising from a little promontory that projects from the\r\nbluff. It can be seen for a long distance and invests with a classical\r\ncharacter the earliest impression of the city. The mansion is spacious,\r\ncontaining thirty large apartments, and is entered through an extensive\r\ncourtyard under a monumental gate. For several years it has been\r\noccupied as a school for engineers.\r\n\r\nIn 1810, when the first census was taken, Odessa had 9,000 population;\r\nin 1910 it has 520,000 but there has been a steady decrease during the\r\nlast five years, which is due to the rivalry of other ports which are\r\nattracting trade because of better harbours, better railway connections\r\nand better facilities for doing business. The strong and violent\r\nsocialistic element in Odessa has also injured the city by frightening\r\naway capital and preventing the establishment of manufacturing\r\nindustries because of the fear of labour strikes.\r\n\r\nAbout 25 per cent. of all the grain exports from Russia were shipped\r\nfrom Odessa until about ten years ago. The total often reached\r\nnearly three million tons, but the old-fashioned methods of handling\r\nfreight, and particularly grain, in use here are so expensive as to be\r\npractically prohibitory. Sometimes the elevator charges are as high\r\nas two and a half cents per pood, or thirty-six pounds. Nicolaieff,\r\nKherson and Rostov-on-the-Don have such superior facilities that Odessa\r\ncannot recover the trade until she improves her docks and harbour and\r\nmechanical appliances for handling freight.\r\n\r\nThe imperial government has plans for extensive improvements in the\r\nharbour of Odessa to furnish suitable facilities for handling the\r\ngrain, at a total expenditure of ten million dollars. A commission\r\nfrom St. Petersburg and the municipal officials have made thorough\r\nsurveys and completed designs which have been submitted to the duma\r\nfor approval and the necessary appropriations. The work will be done\r\nunder the direction of the minister of commerce and labour at St.\r\nPetersburg and will include a breakwater nearly a mile long, costing a\r\nmillion dollars or more, a series of stone wharves and piers costing\r\ntwo millions, railway terminals costing two and a half millions, four\r\ngrain elevators and conveyors, with a capacity of seventy-two thousand\r\ntons, each two millions; granaries, conveyers and other facilities for\r\nloading and unloading, one million; an electric light and power plant\r\nto cost half a million; filling in and reclaiming land, half a\r\nmillion; and various other features.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chamber of Commerce, Odessa]\r\n\r\nOdessa has the reputation of being a very fast city, one of the most\r\nimmoral communities in Europe, and the young Russians are given to\r\ngambling and dissipation of all kinds. At night the streets are\r\nbrilliantly lighted, and are crowded with promenaders of both sexes.\r\nThere are many cafés on the sidewalks, in the interior courts of the\r\nbusiness section, and in the parks and squares. All night the air\r\nis filled with music and laughter, and pleasure-seekers turn night\r\ninto day. One is inclined to wonder when the crowd of men he sees in\r\nthe cafés and theatres attend to their business, but when the shops,\r\noffices, and banks open in the morning at ten o’clock there seems to be\r\nno lack of customers and clerks, and everybody is on the rush.\r\n\r\nThe Exchange, a handsome building of Oriental architecture, is the\r\ncentre of activity. The trading takes place in a splendid hall on lines\r\nsimilar to those of the board of trade at Chicago. The remainder of the\r\nbuilding is devoted to sample rooms, committee rooms, reading rooms,\r\nand other purposes.\r\n\r\nAs grain is the principal staple of southern Russia, and Odessa is the\r\nchief market, all business movements centre around the board of trade.\r\nBusiness is very dull just now; there have been several bad crops;\r\nfourteen of the largest flour mills in the city have been closed down\r\nfor want of wheat to grind, and that has thrown a large number of\r\npeople out of employment, as well as reduced the volume of business.\r\nBut this year’s crop is a record breaker and prosperity is expected\r\nsoon again.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 200,000 Jews in Odessa--exceeding one third of the\r\nentire population--and, as everywhere else, they control the banking,\r\nthe manufacturing, the export trade, the milling, the wholesale and\r\nretail mercantile establishments, and practically everything of an\r\nindustrial and commercial enterprise. And, naturally, they are hated by\r\nthe Russians and envied for their success and prosperity. The prejudice\r\nagainst the Jewish population elsewhere as well as here is due to\r\neconomic rather than religious reasons--simply because they are getting\r\nricher and more prosperous, while the Russians are losing ground in\r\nall the professions and occupations. They have wasted their capital in\r\nbad investments and dissipations and extravagance, and are forced to\r\nmortgage their property to the Jews to keep up appearances.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Jews have been securing control of all the\r\nprofitable enterprises and lines of business in Odessa. Their sons show\r\nthe same earnestness and zeal in the university that they show in the\r\ncounting-room. Therefore they make the best doctors and lawyers and\r\nengineers, and their services are in demand, while the Russian members\r\nof the professions are idly waiting for business. A Russian will employ\r\na Jewish lawyer or doctor or engineer in preference to one of his\r\nown race, not because he loves the Jew or desires to encourage him,\r\nbut simply because he needs him, and recognizes his superiority, his\r\nshrewdness, and his success.\r\n\r\nThe same is true among the working classes. The Russians labourer\r\nspends his wages for vodka. The Jew puts his in the savings bank.\r\nThe Russian labourer never saves anything. The Jew is economical and\r\nabstemious, his family live on bread and vegetables, and by keeping\r\ngood habits they grow strong, while the Russian grows weak. While the\r\nproud young Russian is carousing in the cafés chantant, and losing his\r\nmoney in gambling halls, the Jewish young man is busy with his books.\r\n\r\nThis difference in habits produces the results which exasperate the\r\nRussian and drive him to the persecution of his rivals. He considers\r\nit an insult to himself and his race whenever he hears of a brilliant\r\nachievement or instance of prosperity among the Jews, and the spirit of\r\nenvy and jealousy so aroused is the cause of persecution.\r\n\r\nOdessa is a fine city, one of the finest in Europe, and its proud\r\npeople are in the habit of comparing it with Paris, Vienna, and Berlin.\r\nThe streets are wide and well paved and most of them are shaded with\r\ndouble columns of trees. There is no residence section, however, as\r\nin many other cities, for everybody lives in an apartment-house, with\r\nthe lower floor occupied by shops and the upper floors for lodgings\r\nand offices. Most people live with their business. You will find a\r\nhardware shop, a dairy, a grocery on the ground floor of your dwelling,\r\ninsurance offices and lawyers scattered through the upper floors,\r\nwith the households of the tenants in the adjoining rooms. There is\r\nno home life, almost everybody lunches and dines at a restaurant, and\r\nin the summer months they are mostly on the street. In the winter\r\nthe weather is very cold. In October house-keepers close the double\r\nwindows and stop the leaks with cotton batting and padding made for\r\nthat purpose. This keeps out every particle of fresh air until spring.\r\nI have never found a people so afraid of fresh air as the Russians, and\r\nthat antipathy is very annoying to American and English people who are\r\ncompelled to occupy the same compartments in railway trains and the\r\nsame dining and drawing rooms in the hotels.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity is that everybody wears an overcoat of the same\r\nweight, summer and winter. No matter how hot it is the men wear long,\r\nthick, heavy overcoats over their regular suits. This is especially\r\ntrue of army officers, and it is odd to see a gallant captain in winter\r\napparel walking in the promenade with a graceful young woman in the\r\nlightest of embroidered white batiste.\r\n\r\nThe principal business section of Odessa is noted for its architecture.\r\nThe public buildings and the hotels are unusually good. The cathedral\r\nof the orthodox Greek church, which is placed in the centre of a wide\r\nsquare, where it can be seen to the best advantage, is a splendid\r\nexample of Byzantine architecture, and the interior furnishings fine\r\nexamples of gilt carving. There are several highly revered relics--the\r\narms and fingers and teeth of saints.\r\n\r\nThe municipality erected and owns the opera house, one of the finest\r\nin Europe and modeled after that of Paris. A subsidized opera company\r\ngives performances twice a week for six months of the year. Around\r\nthe opera house is a group of interesting buildings. Several of the\r\nmost important streets of the city focus there. It is the centre of\r\nthe banking community and exporting business. The city hall is a\r\nlarge building of classic design overlooking the bay, and contains\r\na well-proportioned chamber for the use of the provincial duma or\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Municipal Opera House, Odessa]\r\n\r\nBeginning at the city hall and extending for a quarter of a mile or\r\nmore along a bluff that overlooks the bay is a wide promenade, heavily\r\nshaded, that is cool even at noon in the heat of midsummer. There\r\nthousands of people gather every evening and spend the twilight\r\nwalking to and fro, flirting and gossiping and having a good time.\r\nOn a shelf in the bluff a little below is a large and well-arranged\r\nplayground for children, maintained by the city, where grown people,\r\nexcept nurses and mothers, are not admitted. Adjoining it is an\r\nopen-air gymnasium for men, equipped with ample facilities, and that is\r\nwell patronized also.\r\n\r\nLeading from the esplanade to the docks below is a wide stairway of\r\nstone, which was built seventy-five years ago, and a continual stream\r\nof human beings is surging up and down throughout the day and the\r\nnight. There are restaurants and cafés on each side, and at the foot\r\nseveral public bathing-houses before you reach the docks.\r\n\r\nThe principal hotels and cafés front on the promenade, and during the\r\nafternoon and evening the music never ceases and the gay crowds never\r\ngrow less.\r\n\r\nAmong the other public buildings around the opera house is the Imperial\r\nMuseum, where a small but remarkable collection of Scythian and Greek\r\nantiquities from the Crimea and the coast of the Black Sea have been\r\narranged in excellent taste. It is unique in several respects and the\r\nmost important collection consists of twenty thousand coins, dating\r\nback to the beginning of civilization--Greek, Persian, Scythian,\r\nCimmerian, Taurian, Gothic, Avar, Genoese, Turkish, etc. I am told\r\nthere are coins in this collection that cannot be found anywhere else,\r\nand what makes it the more interesting is that every one of them was\r\ndug out of the ground in the Crimea or along the northern shore of the\r\nBlack Sea. How so many coins of different denominations and different\r\nperiods of time came to be buried in the earth is a mystery. Perhaps\r\nit was due to the carelessness of people who went around with holes\r\nin their pockets, scattering silver and gold and copper over the earth\r\nas they walked; perhaps they were so much afraid of burglars that\r\nthey buried their money, or maybe they were overtaken by the wrath of\r\nthe Almighty, like Mrs. Lot, and the money they carried refused to\r\nturn into salt. But it is the actual fact that not only these twenty\r\nthousand specimens, mostly prehistoric, were found in the soil at\r\ndifferent places but similar money is being dug up every few months.\r\n\r\nOpposite the museum is an attractive looking building called the\r\nEnglish clubhouse by a sort of official Irish bull. Notwithstanding\r\nthe name, there isn’t a single Englishman or American in the list of\r\nmembers and no newspaper, magazine, or other publication in the English\r\nlanguage can be found in its reading room. This anomaly is due to\r\nthe opposition of the Russian government to all social organizations\r\namong its subjects, for fear of conspiracies and co-operation in\r\nresisting the tyranny of laws and the police. When this club was\r\nproposed a permit was asked for a social organization on the plan of\r\nan English club, and, after due consideration, it was granted for “an\r\nEnglish club,” that is, a club similar to those of England. Hence the\r\nsignificance of the name.\r\n\r\nThere is a German club and an Anglo-American club in the same\r\nneighbourhood, to which the English-speaking portion of the population\r\nbelongs, and a British Sailors’ Institute on the lines of a Y. M. C. A.\r\nfor the benefit of the crews of the many British steamers which come\r\nregularly to Odessa.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the city the imperial library occupies an imposing\r\nbuilding of classic design with several hundred thousand books. The\r\nuniversity, which ranks third among educational institutions in Russia,\r\noccupies several buildings and has between four thousand and five\r\nthousand students. The schools of art, engineering, chemistry, and\r\nmedicine are celebrated, and the students of medicine have access to\r\nseveral enormous hospitals and charitable institutions for the infirm\r\nand defective. I am told that medical science has attained much higher\r\nproficiency in the southern provinces than in northern Russia.\r\n\r\nThere are several military schools, which are needed more than anything\r\nelse, and are well patronized, for the army is the principal thing\r\nhere, and when a young man is deciding upon a career he always tries\r\nthat first. The army grows bigger, the taxes grow higher, the people\r\ngrow poorer, and labour becomes scarcer in Russia every year. Military\r\nrank seems to be essential to happiness and social prestige. Nearly\r\nevery man you meet on the street or in the hotels and cafés wears a\r\nuniform and everybody has a military rank. The school teacher, the\r\napothecary, the lawyer, and doctor, and architect, the clerks in the\r\ncustom-house, the post-office and city hall--even the convicts in\r\nthe prisons--wear uniforms, and the registrars of the schools of the\r\nuniversity are dressed like major-generals.\r\n\r\nThere is a boom town in southern Russia with a short history like\r\nthat of some of our Western cities--yesterday a village, to-day a\r\nflourishing centre of commerce and trade, to-morrow the metropolis of\r\nthe Black Sea. The boomers call it “The Winnipeg of Europe,” but it\r\nwas named Nicolaieff, in honour of Nicholas, the iron czar, and it is\r\nsituated at the mouth of the river Bug, at the head of an estuary of\r\nthe Black Sea, sixty miles north of Odessa and six hours’ sail from\r\nthat port by the ordinary steamers.\r\n\r\nUntil 1884 Nicolaieff was a sleepy and insignificant village included\r\nin the area which Catherine II wrested from the Great Turk in the war\r\nof 1778. During the Crimean War it gained some historical prestige by\r\nbeing a temporary naval station after Sevastopol was corked up. During\r\nthe latest war between Russia and Turkey in 1877–78 it was used as a\r\nrendezvous camp, but there was no business there until 1884, when a\r\nrailway from Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities in the northern\r\npart of the empire was extended down to touch the Black Sea, and\r\nNicolaieff became an outlet for the grain of southern Russia and an\r\nentrepôt of much imported merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe convenience of the situation, the superiority of its harbour over\r\nthat of Odessa, and the favour of the imperial family and the clique\r\nof sycophants and speculators who hang around the grand dukes, gave\r\nit a preference among shippers, and, since 1898, it has been growing\r\nfaster than Minneapolis or Seattle. It has jumped from 18,000 to\r\n200,000 population in a decade. During the same time it has acquired\r\nthe largest shipping business in grain, manganese ore, and coal in the\r\nRussian Empire and is booming along in an extraordinary manner. The\r\npopulation is increasing at the rate of ten thousand a year. The volume\r\nof business is gaining with even greater rapidity, the value of real\r\nestate has advanced 1,000 per cent. during the last eighteen years and\r\nthe wealth of the community is increasing at a corresponding rate.\r\n\r\nThe successful prosperity of Nicolaieff, correctly or incorrectly,\r\nis attributed to the partiality of the grand dukes and the imperial\r\ncourt, through whose influence much has doubtless been done to\r\nencourage the new town, at the expense of Odessa. A deep harbour has\r\nbeen dredged, with a channel of thirty feet; the government has built\r\nelevators, and the department of communications has manipulated railway\r\nrates and traffic arrangements so as to divert the grain trade in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt is the unanimous opinion that Nicolaieff is favoured above all other\r\ncities by the imperial family and the members of the court, and that\r\nthe benefits and advantages it enjoys have been entirely due to their\r\ninfluence for two reasons:\r\n\r\nFirst, it is asserted that the grand dukes and their friends are\r\nheavily interested in real estate speculations at Nicolaieff and have\r\nmade enormous sums of money by the advance in the prices of property,\r\nwhich is entirely probable.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is asserted that the grand dukes and their friends are not\r\nonly willing but anxious to destroy Odessa because of their hatred of\r\nthe Jews. Nearly all of the business at Nicolaieff is in the hands of\r\nRussians; at Odessa the Jews control everything, and will enjoy the\r\nbenefit of whatever is done for the improvement and prosperity of this\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThis is a strange reason, but stranger things have happened in Russia\r\nand even more civilized countries. The court never comes to Odessa.\r\nThere is no nobility, no aristocracy, no society here. It is purely\r\na business community, and the wealthy classes are all Jews. It is\r\nasserted that the governor-general cannot round up enough civilians\r\nof sufficient rank to fill his dinner table, while a large number of\r\nimpecunious noblemen and poor relations of the proud families of the\r\ncourt have been given lucrative situations at Nicolaieff.\r\n\r\nOne would think that the grand dukes would keep out of such schemes,\r\nafter their experience at Manchuria. It was their avarice and grasping\r\ndisposition that brought on the war with Japan. You will remember that\r\nthe first clash between the two nations occurred in the Yalu Valley of\r\nKorea, where a company organized by the grand dukes was trying to steal\r\nthe timber.\r\n\r\nThat is a historical fact, and there may be equal foundation for the\r\nreports that are so freely repeated concerning their speculations at\r\nNicolaieff. If so, the future prosperity of the town rests upon an\r\nunstable foundation.\r\n\r\nThe latest story is that the naval headquarters are to be removed from\r\nSevastopol to Nicolaieff, through the influence of the grand ducal\r\ncircle, but it scarcely seems credible that such a perfect harbour and\r\nsuch enormous investments in shops, docks, warehouses, arsenals, and\r\nother plants as have been made there should be abandoned to gratify a\r\nfew greedy speculators, not to mention the sentimental and historical\r\ninterest, and the soil that has been sanctified with Russian blood.\r\n\r\nNicolaieff is a very crude and uncouth place at present. It covers an\r\nenormous area, with wide streets, well shaded with artificially planted\r\ntrees, and long blocks of one-story houses. Some of the streets are\r\nthree miles long and two hundred feet wide, with parking in the centre.\r\nAs is usual with new towns, living is very expensive. The swells drink\r\nchampagne instead of beer, and seats at the opera are five rubles\r\ninstead of two. There are several large department stores filled with\r\nthe most expensive goods; the jewellery shops are equal to any in St.\r\nPetersburg and quite as many diamonds are disposed of. One shop sells\r\nnothing but goloshes and during the muddy weather in spring and fall,\r\nfifteen clerks are necessary to serve the crowds of customers. There\r\nare several large restaurants with orchestra music; café chantants are\r\nfound on almost every block, with artists from Paris, and they run all\r\nnight. The most popular resort just now is an American skating rink.\r\n\r\nThe school-houses are superior to any others in Russia, outside of\r\nSt. Petersburg or Moscow. There are technical schools for instruction\r\nin all the branches; there is a military school, a naval academy and\r\na school of art and architecture. Altogether Nicolaieff is the most\r\nup-to-date town in the empire, and has great confidence in the future.\r\nThe municipality has recently negotiated a loan for $500,000,000 for\r\npublic improvements--an electric tramway, a new sewerage system, new\r\nmarkets and slaughter-houses, a new court-house and school-houses and a\r\nmunicipal pawnshop.\r\n\r\nKherson, one of the oldest towns on the Black Sea, not far from\r\nNicolaieff, is also prospering mightily under the favour of the\r\nimperial government. While its future is not so bright as that of\r\nNicolaieff, a great deal of government money is being spent there for\r\npublic improvements and it is growing rapidly.\r\n\r\nKherson has a historic interest, because it was the home and is the\r\nburial place of the great Prince Potemkin, one of the many lovers of\r\nCatherine the Great, who conquered this country for her and added\r\nthe north coast of the Black Sea to her domain. He died in 1791\r\nand Catherine built a cathedral over his grave. Her crazy son and\r\nsuccessor, Paul I, jealous of his mother’s love for Potemkin and his\r\ninfluence over her life, ordered the body to be taken from the splendid\r\nmarble sarcophagus she had designed for it, and “thrown into a hole\r\nunder the floor of the crypt, and the crypt filled with earth, and\r\nlevelled over, so that it will appear as if it had never existed.” This\r\norder was obeyed, but in 1854 Nicholas I had the crypt cleared out and\r\nthe remains of Potemkin restored to the altar of the cathedral and a\r\nmonument erected in memory of the great prince upon which his principal\r\nachievements are inscribed.\r\n\r\nThere is an extraordinary painting in this cathedral, which illustrates\r\nhow far the flattery of empresses can be carried. It represents\r\nCatherine the Great in the guise of the Holy Virgin, borne to paradise\r\non the back of a double-headed eagle of Russia.\r\n\r\nJohn Howard, the great English philanthropist, is also buried at\r\nKherson, where he had large business interests and spent much time.\r\nHe died there while on a business visit. There is a monument to his\r\nmemory, erected by the citizens, bearing this inscription:\r\n\r\n                            JOHN HOWARD\r\n                       Died January 20, 1790\r\n                In the fifty-sixth year of his age\r\n                        Vixit Propter Alios\r\n                        Alios Salvos Fecit\r\n\r\nSouthern Russia is developing very rapidly in population, in wealth, in\r\nthe area of land cultivated and in the volume of grain harvested and\r\ncoal produced. The large estates, which have comprised as many as forty\r\nthousand and fifty thousand acres, owned by non-residents among the\r\nnobility, are being split up into small farms and sold to the tenants\r\nwho actually work the land, through the assistance of agricultural\r\nbanks which have been established by the Russian government.\r\n\r\nMany wise people think this is a bad policy, because the small farmer\r\ncannot handle labour-saving machinery, and thus multiply the capacity\r\nof his hands, but the socialistic policy of the duma is to feed the\r\nland-hungry, and every peasant demands a farm. There has been no\r\nnecessity of applying the compulsory clause or going into the courts\r\nor commencing proceedings for expropriation. Sufficient land has been\r\noffered for sale thus far to satisfy every demand, as in Ireland, and\r\nwithin a few years the entire area of southern Russia will be divided\r\nup into “one-mule farms,” which is as much as one family can cultivate.\r\n\r\nA good deal is being done in the way of improving the educational\r\nfacilities of the peasants. There is now a school in almost every\r\nvillage and almost every child fifteen years old and under can read\r\nand write. Fifteen years ago a peasant who could read and write was as\r\nrare as a lion. The schools are of a very low grade, however, and the\r\nnumber ought to be increased, but the officials who have charge of such\r\nmatters answer the criticism by saying that they will start a school\r\nfor every competent teacher that can be found. It is not a question\r\nof school-houses, they declare, but a question of teachers. Other\r\npeople retort that there would be a sufficient number of teachers if\r\nthe government would offer reasonable wages. The salaries paid are no\r\ninducement for competent teachers to offer their services. Educated men\r\nand women can earn more money in other occupations.\r\n\r\nThere is a deep murmur of discontent throughout all the provinces that\r\nhave been annexed to Russia within the last century, over a recent\r\nedict issued by the czar prohibiting instruction in any other but the\r\nRussian language and forbidding the organization of literary societies\r\nand mutual improvement clubs to study other languages and literature.\r\nThe same trouble occurred in the Turkish provinces, but as the Russian\r\nEmpire is a conglomerate of seventy-seven different races, each having\r\nits own language, history and traditions, the situation is more serious.\r\n\r\nThe object of this edict is to Russianize and assimilate these numerous\r\nelements and destroy, as far as possible, their individuality and\r\nclannishness, but the people consider it an attack upon their race\r\nand their traditions, and it has caused an intense prejudice against\r\nthe Russian national public schools. I am told there has been much\r\nimprovement in the personnel of the clergy of the Russian church. It is\r\nslow, but apparent. The salaries paid to the priests are not sufficient\r\nto support their families, and therefore intelligent and educated\r\nmen are kept out of the priesthood. The ignorance and incompetency\r\nof the priests is responsible for a dry rot and an almost universal\r\ndisintegration in the established church. The intelligent people\r\nare losing their respect for the priesthood and drifting away into\r\ndissenting sects, which are becoming stronger and more numerous as they\r\nattract more intelligent and influential elements of the population.\r\n\r\nEverybody will agree that it is a good deal of a job to steal a\r\nbattleship, but that very thing was done off the harbour of Sevastopol\r\non June 27, 1905, during the Russian revolution. There is a big fleet\r\nof war vessels always lying in the inner and outer bay of Sevastopol,\r\nstrung along for several miles, and some of them go out to maneuvre\r\nevery day. I counted three battleships, four cruisers, and we could\r\nsee a swarm of gunboats, torpedo boats and submarines, and three or\r\nfour big transports tied up at the dock of the naval station. They were\r\npainted “battle gray,” or lead colour, and looked very formidable; but\r\nthe record made by the Russian navy in the war with Japan demonstrated\r\nthat it can lose ships easier than it can capture them.\r\n\r\nThe huge, lead-coloured leviathan called _Panteleimon_, in honour of\r\none of the most popular saints in the Russian calendar, was formerly\r\nthe _Potemkin_, and under that name left Sevastopol for gun practice\r\nSunday morning, June 25, 1905, convoyed by a torpedo boat. On Tuesday\r\nthe crew sent a round robin to the captain declaring that their food\r\nwas not fit to eat and that the meat especially was decomposed and\r\nunhealthful. At the second meal on that day the crew refused to eat\r\ntheir rations and dumped them overboard. They were mustered on the\r\nquarterdeck, where the executive officer ordered those who considered\r\nthe food wholesome and had taken no part in the demonstration to step\r\nto starboard.\r\n\r\nA majority of the sailors obeyed the order. The malcontents were then\r\nordered forward, and as they started at a sign from their leader each\r\nseized a gun from the pyramids that were stacked upon the deck after\r\nthe muster, and each began to load with cartridges from his belt. The\r\nexecutive officer commanded them to stack the guns. As they refused\r\nto obey, he seized a gun from the nearest man and fired two or three\r\nshots with it at the spokesman of the complainants, who fell mortally\r\nwounded to the deck, and died in a few moments. The mutineers returned\r\nthe fire and followed the officers to their cabins, shooting them down\r\nas fast as they were overtaken. Several officers who jumped overboard\r\nwere killed in the water, and it is said that a rapid-fire gun was used\r\nupon them. Every officer and midshipman on the _Potemkin_ and about\r\nthirty sailors were killed in the mêlée. The officers on the torpedo\r\nboat attempted to go to the rescue of their comrades on the _Potemkin_,\r\nbut the sailors would not permit it, and before the day was over seized\r\ntheir commander and all the other officers, put them into a boat and\r\ncut them adrift.\r\n\r\nA managing committee of twenty mutineers was organized upon the\r\n_Potemkin_, who selected the chief boatswain for navigator, and started\r\nfor Odessa, where they arrived about daylight the next morning, June\r\n28. They took ashore the body of the sailor who was first killed by\r\nthe executive officer, placed it in a coffin and left it lying upon a\r\nbier in front of a Russian orthodox church near the railway wharves,\r\nwhich is attended chiefly by sailors and workingmen. Inscribed upon a\r\npaper pinned to the breast of the dead man was his name, Omelchuk, and\r\na statement that he had been murdered by Captain Gilyarkovsky because\r\nhe was not willing to eat putrid food. It was also explained that all\r\nof the officers of the battleship had been killed by the crew, and that\r\nthe vessel was under the command of a committee of sailors, who would\r\nbombard the city if any attempt was made to take away the body of the\r\nsailor or attack the ship.\r\n\r\nThe news spread rapidly and created a profound sensation. Thousands\r\nof workmen gathered around the bier at the church and listened to\r\ninflammatory speeches made by anarchists and other agitators, and\r\non the following day began a series of riots lasting all that week;\r\naccompanied by murders, looting, arson, highway robbery, blackmail, and\r\nthe hold-up of all passenger trains on the railroads entering the city.\r\nThis disturbance was followed by a general strike in which the strikers\r\nset fire to warehouses, elevators and other buildings along the dock,\r\nseizing the cargoes of several steamers and throwing them into the sea.\r\nAlmost the entire docks of Odessa were swept with fire, and many of the\r\nrioters, drunk with wine and other liquors found in looting, are said\r\nto have perished in the flames. The exact number of killed during the\r\ndisorders has never been ascertained, but is estimated at six hundred\r\nmen, with a few women and children. The financial loss and damage done\r\nto property amounted to several millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on the stolen battleship _Potemkin_ was lying at\r\nanchor in the harbour within sight of the esplanade which is the centre\r\nof social gayety and a parade ground for the people of Odessa. The\r\nnext morning the sailors seized two colliers, private property, and\r\ntransferred the coal to the bunkers of the battleship.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth of June the Black Sea fleet, consisting of four\r\nbattleships and five torpedo boats, arrived at Odessa under command of\r\na senior flag-officer and the _Potemkin_ went out to meet them with\r\ndecks cleared for action. She first ranged alongside the battleship\r\n_George Victorius_, the crew of which met them with an ovation and\r\nimmediately after rose in mutiny, overpowered their officers, disarmed\r\nthem, and conducted them ashore, with the exception of Lieutenant\r\nGrigorkoff, officer of the deck, who committed suicide.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers, having full possession of the _George Victorius_,\r\nappointed a committee of twenty sailors to take charge. A quarrel\r\nensued, and a portion of the crew, actuated partially by fear of\r\npunishment and partially by jealousy and dissatisfaction, gained the\r\nupper hand and under the leadership of the boatswain surrendered to\r\nthe commander of the military district of Odessa. Several days later\r\nthe crew delivered over sixty-seven of the leaders in the mutiny and\r\nrenewed their oaths of allegiance to the czar. After this the commander\r\nand officers of the vessel went on board and resumed their former\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the transport _Prut_ also mutinied, seized their officers,\r\nkilling an ensign and boatswain who resisted. But on the following day\r\nthey thought better of the situation, released their officers, and\r\nrequested them to take command again.\r\n\r\nThe battleship _Potemkin_, under the command of her former boatswain,\r\nattended by the torpedo boat No. 267, then started for a cruise around\r\nthe Black Sea, visiting various ports, saluting them according to\r\ncustom and, in two instances, requesting provisions and fuel, which\r\nwere refused. At the port of Constanza, in Roumania, the authorities\r\nendeavoured to persuade the mutineers to surrender the ship, with\r\nan assurance that they should not be arrested or held subject to\r\nextradition, but after consulting together the six hundred sailors\r\nrejected the proposition and continued to sail about several days\r\nlonger until their coal gave out. Finally, when they realized that it\r\nwas impossible for them to obtain more fuel, or to continue afloat\r\nwithout it, they cruised quietly into the harbour at Constanza,\r\nRoumania, where the committee in command entered into negotiations\r\nwith the government for the surrender of the ship.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that none of the mutineers should be arrested, detained,\r\nor otherwise interfered with, but that every man aboard would be\r\npermitted to land and to go where he pleased, on condition that no arms\r\nor other property belonging to the ship should be injured or carried\r\naway, and that everything should be left exactly as it was when the\r\nmutiny broke out. It was also agreed that the sailors should be given\r\nfive days to get out of the country.\r\n\r\nThis agreement was kept, and five days later the _Potemkin_ was\r\ndelivered by the captain of the port of Constanza to a crew of officers\r\nand men from the Russian navy, who were sent down from Sevastopol\r\nfor that purpose. Her bunkers were filled with coal and she was\r\ntaken back to Sevastopol, where she was repainted and renamed. Her\r\nextraordinary experience is never alluded to in the Russian navy. It\r\nis a painful topic. Most of the mutineers left Constanza and scattered\r\nover Europe. Those who remained in Roumania have been protected, but\r\nmany of the others have been captured. Some are in prison, some were\r\nshot at the time of the arrest, others were hanged under sentence of a\r\ncourt-martial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE KINGDOM OF ROUMANIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe western coast of the Black Sea is divided into four parts--the\r\nRussian province of Bessarabia at the north, a strip of European Turkey\r\nat the south, and between these two contesting nations are Bulgaria\r\nand Roumania. The latter is a recent nation, made up of the ancient\r\nprincipalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, which have the Danube River\r\nfor their southern and the Carpathian Mountains for the northern and\r\nwestern boundary. Hungary is on the other side of the range.\r\n\r\nRoumania is the most advanced of all the Balkan states yet at the same\r\ntime one third of its area toward the north and west is inhabited by a\r\nsemi-savage class of shepherds--one of the strangest peoples in Europe.\r\nThey follow their flocks in utter solitude among the heights of the\r\nCarpathians during the warmer months of the year, and in the winter\r\ndrive them down into the sheltered valleys and plains. They never\r\naccept the shelter of a roof, but sleep among their flocks like dogs,\r\nno matter how cold the atmosphere or how deep the snow. They seldom\r\nspeak, and many of them have lost the use of their tongues in their\r\nsolitary existence. They are a race by themselves. They are entirely\r\nilliterate; they cannot abide in towns, and they wear a costume of\r\ntheir own, consisting of coarse white woollen shirts, long mantles of\r\nwool as thick as a carpet, and high caps of sheepskin with the wool\r\nupon them. They let their hair grow long until it hangs upon their\r\nshoulders, and their beards sometimes reach to their waists. They\r\nare very superstitious; they know all the signs and omens, and their\r\nfolk-lore and legends have been the theme of poets and writers of\r\nromance for centuries.\r\n\r\nThere is a race of gypsies in Roumania, too, of greater numbers than\r\nare found in any other country. They are called Tzigany and are\r\nfamous for their musical genius. Tzigany orchestras are the fashion\r\nin European restaurants these days, and their wild, weird, passionate\r\nmusic has a fascination and an exhilaration that comes from none\r\nother. These gypsies number perhaps a quarter of a million and are\r\nrelated to the tribes that wander about Hungary. They preserve their\r\ndistinctive habits, customs, and dress as well as their racial purity\r\nwith fierce jealousy. No Tzigany ever marries any but a gypsy; and they\r\nare faithful until death to the members of their own race, although\r\ntheir transactions with the rest of the population are usually open to\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nThe population of Roumania is about six million, of whom about three\r\nhundred thousand are Jews, 250,000 Roman Catholics, 50,000 Protestants\r\nand the rest orthodox Greeks. It is a singular fact that, although\r\na greater part of the population belong to the Greek Church, their\r\ngreatest pride and satisfaction are found in their descent from the\r\nRoman legions which overcame and occupied the country during the reign\r\nof the emperor Trajan, a century after the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe famous column of Trajan, in the centre of Rome, which is familiar\r\nto everybody, bears an epitome in marble of his campaign for the\r\nsubjugation of Roumania. You will remember that it is covered with\r\ncarvings, winding around it from top to bottom, like the coils of a\r\nserpent, which show the progress of armies and battle scenes. These\r\ncarved reliefs contain 2,500 human figures and representations of\r\nhundreds of animals and other objects, and all of them relate to\r\nRoumania. Trajan lies buried beneath this column, but in the Middle\r\nAges the piety of the popes led them to remove his statue, which was\r\noriginally placed upon the summit, and to replace it by one of St.\r\nPeter, so that the rock upon which the Christian church was builded now\r\nassumes, responsibility for the Roman campaign along the Danube.\r\n\r\nTrajan left his legions in Roumania as a rampart against the barbarians\r\nupon the north and east, and, notwithstanding the constant invasions\r\nof Avars, Huns, Goths, Tartars, Mongols, Turks, and other hordes from\r\nAsia, their descendants have held their ground, and nothing, as I have\r\nsaid, is dearer to them than their consciousness of Latin origin. Many\r\nof the customs of the ancient Romans still prevail. And on a certain\r\nholiday in all the villages may be witnessed a revival of the Pyrrhic\r\ndance so sacred in mythology. The peasants wear robes in imitation of\r\nthose of the ancient Roman warriors, with bells on their belts and\r\nsleeves; they stamp their feet on the ground like the North American\r\nIndians, and they shout in unison as the warriors of mythology are said\r\nto have shouted in order to prevent Saturn from hearing the voice of\r\nthe infant Jupiter, the future king of the gods. The Roumanian peasants\r\nbestow Latin names upon their children, and even upon their steers. A\r\nfarmer will call his oxen after Cassius, Cæsar, Brutus, Augustus, and\r\nAntony, and the name of Trajan is as common as the name of John with us.\r\n\r\nThere are several tangible traces of Trajan remaining. One of them is\r\na bridge which he built to convey his army across the Danube in the\r\nyear 104 A.D. It consisted originally of twenty piers, each 160 feet\r\nlong, 145 feet high and 58 feet wide. The original piers still remain\r\nas solid as the mountains, although the bridge has several times been\r\nrebuilt; and the road which leads to the bridge along the right bank of\r\nthe Danube is still maintained. Whoever cares to go there may find a\r\nbronze tablet blackened by the hand of centuries, which still bears a\r\nLatin inscription, with the name and the titles and the achievements of\r\nTrajan.\r\n\r\nThe original inhabitants of the country were called Dacians, and their\r\nwarlike disposition got them into print very frequently. They are\r\ndiscussed by Pliny and Herodotus as the bravest and most honourable of\r\nall the barbarian tribes, and Thucydides alludes to their prowess on\r\nhorseback with the bow and arrow and the determination with which they\r\nresisted the advance of the Persian king, Darius. About 325 B.C. Philip\r\nof Macedon invaded Dacia and laid siege to one of the towns. That great\r\nGrecian conqueror was about to give the signal for an assault upon\r\nthe walls, when the gates opened and a long line of priests, clad in\r\nsnow-white robes, with lyres in their hands, came forth and approached\r\nthe Macedonian camp with songs of peace. Impressed with the spectacle\r\nand their confidence in him, Philip spared the citadel, married Meda,\r\nthe daughter of the king, and entered into a treaty of offence and\r\ndefence, which was greatly to his advantage in his future campaigns.\r\nEven to-day the natives wear gold pieces bearing the busts of Philip\r\nand Alexander the Great and their successors upon the Macedonian throne.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were driven out by the Goths and afterward by the Huns, and\r\nfor a thousand years the history of the country is one continuous and\r\nconfusing struggle against successive savage tribes, which marched both\r\neast and west, going and coming between Europe and Asia. The high road\r\nbetween the continents led over Roumanian soil, and the trail is now\r\nfollowed very closely by the railway between Budapest and Constanza,\r\nthe principal port of Roumania upon the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nConstantine the Great introduced Christianity, and by the year 360 A.D.\r\nDacia was one of the most thoroughly civilized parts of Christendom,\r\nbut there was no peace for the people until they obtained their present\r\ngovernment. For century after century no settled authority seems to\r\nhave existed in the country, which was the shuttle-cock of the rival\r\nsovereigns of Russia, Hungary, Poland, and Turkey. Peter the Great took\r\nthe country under his protection, and Catherine the Great soon after\r\nher accession began to prepare the Roumanians for annexation to Russia.\r\nShe was not able to carry out her designs, because Austria had become\r\nrestive at the rapid expansions of Russia in her direction, and it was\r\nsolely to pacify Austrian fears that Russia in 1774 consented to place\r\nMoldavia and Wallachia under the protectorate of the sultan of Turkey.\r\n\r\nIn that relation the people lived until the great revolution of 1848,\r\nwhich, sweeping over Europe, aroused the national spirit among the\r\nRoumanians and revived their pride in their ancient origin, their\r\nnative language, their literature and their history. The wealthier\r\nfamilies, the land owners, called boyards, as in Russia, sent their\r\nyoung men to the universities of Germany and France, where they\r\ndeveloped ideas of liberty and patriotism and came home to educate\r\nthe people. The same spirit aroused the neighbouring nations to\r\ncivil liberty and advocated independence from Russia and Turkey, and\r\nRoumanian patriots offered their lives as a sacrifice for the freedom\r\nof their country. The revolutionary leaders, however, were compelled to\r\nflee, but proclaimed the grievances of their country wherever they were\r\nscattered and awakened practical sympathy in France and in England and\r\nwherever the friends of liberty were found.\r\n\r\nThe Crimean war gave them a chance to escape from the control of both\r\nthe principal participants in that great struggle, and one of the\r\narticles in the treaty of peace guaranteed the autonomy of the two\r\nprovinces along the northern bank of the Danube. This action was soon\r\nfollowed by a mutual agreement between Wallachia and Moldavia to unite\r\nas a single state under a single government with a foreign prince, a\r\nmember of some reigning family of Europe, as their king. In 1859 they\r\nboth elected Col. Alexander Couza as their “hospodar,” or lord, who\r\nassumed the throne as Alexander John I, Prince of Roumania.\r\n\r\nCouza was a failure. He did not please anybody, and in 1866 was forced\r\nto abdicate in a dramatic manner. The incident was repeated almost\r\nin detail twenty years after at Sofia, capital of the neighbouring\r\nkingdom, when Prince Alexander of Bulgaria was compelled to resign\r\nhis throne. On the night of Feb. 23, 1866, a party of army officers,\r\nmembers of the national assembly, and leading citizens of Roumania\r\nentered the palace, forced open the door of the prince’s bedroom and\r\ndemanded his abdication. The document had already been prepared, and\r\nwhen the prince was handed a pen wet with ink he signed it promptly.\r\n\r\nHe was allowed to dress and pack a few necessities for travelling, was\r\nplaced in a carriage and driven by relays of horses to the nearest\r\nrailway station, where he was shipped off to Paris, and Roumania saw\r\nhim no more.\r\n\r\nA provincial government was organized, a national assembly was called\r\nand proceeded to elect the Count of Flanders, younger brother of the\r\nlate King Leopold of Belgium, as hospodar. The sultan protested,\r\nand the Count of Flanders declined the honour. Prince Charles of\r\nHohenzollern, a member of the royal family of Prussia, was chosen in\r\nhis stead and the choice was unanimously ratified by a vote of the\r\nwhole people. Again the neighbouring nations remonstrated, but Bismarck\r\nsent for Prince Charles, who was then a colonel of dragoons in the\r\nPrussian army, and advised him to hurry to Bucharest in disguise,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“If you fail, you will at any rate have a pleasant reminiscence for the\r\nrest of your life.”\r\n\r\nOne month later Prince Charles appeared at Bucharest and was received\r\nwith great enthusiasm. He had slipped through Austria in disguise.\r\n\r\nPrince Charles was proclaimed ruler of Roumania on his twenty-seventh\r\nbirthday. His father was the head of one of the non-reigning branches\r\nof the Hohenzollern family of Prussia, and a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm\r\nthe Great. His grandmother was a Bonaparte. He was educated at Dresden\r\nand had served for several years in a crack regiment of Prussian\r\ncavalry. He was a personal favourite at the courts of Vienna, Berlin,\r\nSt. Petersburg, and Paris. He was a man of broad ideas, accurate\r\njudgment, and keen intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the new prince was to call a convention to revise\r\nthe constitution, which was liberalized and gave the Roumanians a\r\nfree press, free speech, free religion, free compulsory education and\r\nother rights and privileges. And its provisions have been recognized\r\nconsistently in relation to the Jews, whose commercial supremacy\r\nand success have aroused the jealousy of the less enterprising and\r\nintelligent natives, as in Russia, and has made them the object of the\r\nmost cruel persecution to which that race has been subjected in recent\r\nyears. There have been numerous conspiracies and intrigues against the\r\nauthority of Prince Charles, but he has grown in strength with years,\r\nand in 1906 celebrated the fortieth anniversary of his reign amid\r\nuniversal rejoicings and unanimous expressions of confidence.\r\n\r\nDuring his reign he has distinguished himself as a military commander\r\nas well as a statesman. He supported the Russian army with great skill\r\nand courage in the war with Turkey in 1877–78. On March 26, 1881,\r\nRoumania proclaimed herself a kingdom, with the consent of the Powers,\r\nand the prince was recrowned King Carol I.\r\n\r\nThe crown that was placed upon his head was made of iron from the\r\nTurkish cannon which he had personally captured at the battle of\r\nPlevna. Since that date Roumania has made constant progress in wealth\r\nand civilization, and although the king has remained childless, the\r\npeople have cordially accepted his nephew, Prince Ferdinand, as heir to\r\nthe throne, and the latter has strengthened his claims for popularity\r\nby marrying the Princess Marie, daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg\r\nand Gotha, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth of Roumania is probably the most accomplished and\r\nintellectual of all the royal women of Europe. She speaks, reads, and\r\nwrites six languages fluently, and has written poems in four. She is\r\na poetess of no mean ability and her stories and essays have been\r\nawarded a high place in European literature. They have been translated\r\ninto all the modern languages and have been read by the people of\r\nevery civilized land. A book of maxims, entitled “The Thoughts of\r\na Queen,” was granted a medal of honour by the French Academy. She\r\nhas published more than thirty books and has contributed hundreds of\r\narticles to magazines. She has shown unusual skill in literary research\r\nin connection with Roumanian legends and folk-lore. She has written an\r\nopera entitled “Master Manole,” which has been successfully presented\r\nin Munich and other cities of Europe. She is a brilliant pianist\r\nand was a favourite pupil of Rubinstein and Clara Schumann. She is\r\nequally accomplished as an organist and frequently conducts orchestral\r\nconcerts in the music hall of the palace at Bukharest. She has composed\r\nsymphonies and other orchestral pieces. She plays the harp gracefully,\r\nand has adapted the gypsy melodies of her country to that instrument,\r\nfrequently calling attention to their similarity to the ancient\r\nmelodies for the harp in Ireland.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth is also an accomplished artist. She has painted several\r\npictures of recognized merit and has done miniatures of many of her\r\nfriends on ivory. She is skilful with a needle, in embroidery and in\r\nlacemaking, and has introduced both arts among the peasant women of\r\nRoumania. She has also introduced the silk worm and has persuaded the\r\ngovernment to plant hundreds of thousands of mulberry trees throughout\r\nthe country. She has founded schools, opera houses, hospitals, asylums\r\nof various sorts, training homes for nurses, and a home for women\r\nof education who have lost their money. Much of her time is devoted\r\nto charity and in organizing and directing both military and civil\r\nhospitals and other institutions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the national religion is the orthodox Greek, and King Carol,\r\nher husband, made a public profession of that faith when he was crowned\r\nin 1866, Queen Elizabeth was excused from doing so at the time of their\r\nmarriage in 1869, and has continued to be an earnest and active member\r\nof the Lutheran congregation in Bukharest, for which she erected a\r\nmodest but appropriate house of worship at her own expense. However,\r\nshe does not intrude her faith upon others and participates in the\r\nreligious festivals of the people without the slightest reserve. They\r\nknow that she is a Protestant and that she recognizes the claims of\r\ntheir own faith and always remembers that she is the queen of an\r\northodox Greek population.\r\n\r\nThose who know her well say that she never wastes a moment, and she\r\nkeeps many assistants busy looking out for the poor, finding employment\r\nfor those who need it and serving the interests of the Roumanian\r\npeople. Although Bukharest has the reputation of being a very immoral\r\ncity, there has never been a scandal in the court; her ladies in\r\nwaiting and maids of honour have always been women of exemplary lives,\r\nand their devotion to her is remarkable. Her sweet disposition, her\r\ngenerous heart, and her anxiety for the welfare of her subjects are\r\nuniversally recognized, and it is said that no one has even known her\r\nwho has not loved her.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth is better known throughout the world by her nom de\r\nplume of “Carmen Sylva,” and many people who have read her charming\r\nlyrics have been ignorant of the fact that they were written by a\r\nqueen. The peasants of Roumania call her “Mamma Regina.” She is now\r\nsixty-seven years old, short in stature, a matronly figure, a bright\r\ncomplexion, and pure white hair. Her features are small, her profile is\r\nregular Greek; her lips are thin; her eyes are blue, and her forehead\r\nis high. She usually brushes her hair straight over a roll and coiled\r\nat the back of her head in the old-fashioned way. On formal occasions\r\nshe appears in royal robes; when she goes out among the people in\r\nthe country she usually wears the national dress, which pleases them\r\nimmensely, and while she is at home and employed among her multifarious\r\nand often distracting duties she dresses in plain black with a\r\nwhite linen collar. Her gowns and her hats are seldom at the height\r\nof fashion, and most of the wives of the boyards, the land-owning\r\naristocracy of Roumania, spend more for gowns and jewels than she. On\r\nstate occasions she wears a crown that once was worn by Josephine, the\r\nunhappy empress of Napoleon I, and she owns a string of pearls that was\r\nalso worn by Josephine, to whom her husband’s great-grandmother was\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding her unqualified popularity among her own subjects, her\r\nbrilliant success in everything she has undertaken, and the respect\r\nand esteem in which she is universally held by the royal families of\r\nEurope, “Carmen Sylva” has had a very sad life, and when her face is at\r\nrest one can recognize the effect sorrow has had upon her. The saddest\r\nthoughts that come into her mind are regrets for her childlessness. A\r\nbabe was born to her after she had been three years upon the throne,\r\nand she called her Marie. But the child lived only a few years and\r\ntheir cradle has since then been empty. The royal palace at Bukharest\r\nhas known no greater sorrow.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth is the daughter of the Prince van Wied, whose ancestors\r\nheld for several centuries one of the most noble and picturesque\r\ncastles upon the banks of the Rhine. Her mother was the eldest daughter\r\nof the duke of Nassau, sister of the late queen of Sweden, and of the\r\npresent duke of Luxenburg. Her aunt is the venerable Grand Duchess\r\nHelena, widow of Grand Duke Michael of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe queen’s childhood was full of sadness because of the illness of\r\nher father and her only brother, for both of whom she was nurse and\r\ncompanion. The boy was afflicted with an incurable disease from birth,\r\nbut had a brilliant mind and lingered on earth until he was fourteen\r\nor fifteen years old. Elizabeth’s life was wrapped up in his, for they\r\nwere never separated until his death. She has written the pathetic\r\nstory in lines that bleed. After the death of her father and brother\r\nshe made the tour of Europe with her mother, and visited several of the\r\ncourts of her royal relatives, but at a hotel in Cologne she accepted\r\na proposal of marriage from her future husband, Prince Carol of\r\nHohenzollern, then a colonel in the Prussian army, who had been elected\r\nking of Roumania a few months previous and had gone to Bukharest in\r\ndisguise to accept the crown. Their courtship was very brief and\r\nunromantic. “Carmen Sylva” once told the story to Helene Vacaresco,\r\none of her ladies-in-waiting, and it is worth repeating.\r\n\r\n“One day at Cologne,” she said, “where we had gone to spend a few hours\r\nand listen to a Beethoven festival, we met, by accident, the reigning\r\nprince of Roumania, Prince Charles of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. We were\r\nstaying that afternoon at the Hotel du Nord, which can be seen as the\r\ntrain crosses the Cologne station--I never pass on my way to Germany\r\nwithout remembering vividly every word of the interview there which\r\nsettled my fate. I was very glad to meet the prince of Roumania again,\r\nas he had been much talked about in my presence of late, and I knew he\r\nhad won his way to the throne among political perils almost as great\r\nas the perils of war. He had crossed Austria in disguise, because the\r\nAustrian government had objected strongly to his election.\r\n\r\n“In the small garden of the Hotel du Nord, where the beautiful towers\r\nof the cathedral threw their shadows upon us, I poured eager questions\r\ninto his ears without even casting a glance at his refined and regular\r\nfeatures, and he patiently answered every one of my inquiries. He told\r\nme about his difficult task, and about the exotic country that had\r\nbecome his own, his wide plains and savage mountains, its white-clad\r\npeasantry, frugal, grave, and endowed with weird powers of untaught\r\neloquence and poetry. He spoke long and well, while I listened\r\nbreathlessly, rapt in astonishment and delight. He described the great\r\nmasters of the land, those boyards, cultivated yet barbarous in mind\r\nand customs, whose souls were alive with the blended charm of the\r\nByzantine influence, and the hot blood of old Latin descent. I envied\r\nthe young sovereign who had taken up a sceptre whose maintenance\r\nrequired as firm a grasp as a sword, and I said to him, openly: ‘You\r\nare a happy man.’\r\n\r\n“‘And the concert?’ asked my mother as we went up to our rooms. ‘You\r\nwere so impatient to go to the concert before we met the prince.’\r\n\r\n“‘The concert?’ I repeated in utter amazement. ‘I had forgotten all\r\nabout the concert! Oh, mother, you can’t guess how deeply interesting,\r\nhow thrilling is the conversation of the prince of Roumania, and how I\r\nenvy him his beautiful task! Just imagine, he rules a nation quite new\r\nto the world, but, at the same time, ancient in blood and history; and\r\nhe has to understand them and to make them happy. A splendid mission,\r\nindeed!’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, my child, that task, that mission, might be yours also. The\r\nprince of Roumania wants to marry you. He has come here with the sole\r\npurpose of meeting you. This is no chance encounter, as you believe.\r\nYou have but one word to say.’\r\n\r\n“I remained perfectly bewildered for a few seconds; then, as if urged\r\non by the resistless impulse of my destiny, I answered:\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, I will marry him. I will help him and follow him to that\r\nwonderful land.’\r\n\r\n“Half an hour afterward the prince of Hohenzollern came up to our\r\nprivate sitting room. He kissed my hand as he entered, and my lips\r\ntrembled timidly for one moment on his bowed forehead. Then he knew\r\nthat he was my accepted future husband. This time he did all the\r\ntalking himself; I was abashed and silent, but still intent on his\r\nevery word. Not one syllable of love, not one stray compliment, was\r\nuttered during those hours whose meaning has since thrown a light over\r\nmy whole existence. Ours was no love marriage, but it was a union based\r\non self-devotion, duty, and a fervent desire to do our best toward each\r\nother and toward the nation that I already loved. That very evening the\r\nprince went back to Roumania; he was to return in three weeks, and then\r\ntake me back with him as his wife.”\r\n\r\nHelene Vacaresco who, as I have said, has been a lady in waiting to\r\nQueen Elizabeth for many years, and is her authorized biographer,\r\ncommenting upon her usefulness and devotion to her subjects, says:\r\n\r\n“From the moment of her arrival in her new country to this hour, her\r\nlife has been a constant effort, a constant labour of love on behalf of\r\nher people. Patiently and without ceasing she listens to the throbbing\r\nof their veins, to the wants and aspirations of a race she has tried so\r\nhard to understand that she has almost become a Roumanian herself.\r\n\r\n“When she reached the banks of the Danube, when before her dazzled\r\nsight white-clad peasants made their appearance, wearing carved silver\r\nknives in their belts and big peacock feathers on their high fur caps;\r\nwhen in brilliant costumes the women rushed forth to meet her, veils\r\nthin as the mountain mists floating around their proud features, and\r\ndistaffs trembling on their bosoms; when the gayly attired village\r\nbeauties danced the national dances before her to the sound of the\r\nrude violin; when disheveled and ragged tziganes played tunes a\r\nthousand years old, yet fresh with the eternal youth of innocence, then\r\nElizabeth believed her own life would be like an eternal pastorale.\r\nAnd at once she gave her heart to the rustic crowds whose welcome\r\nwas showered upon her, who blessed her winning smile and her ready\r\ncuriosity to learn more about them and their village homes. No one\r\nwill ever know or appreciate the whole extent of the labour that from\r\nmorning to eve made her stoop toward the soil from which she drew the\r\nsecrets of the race, or raise her head to the sky whence faith and\r\ninspiration descended upon her sacred toil.”\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth and her ladies in waiting spend the summer months at\r\nCastle Polesch, at Sinaia, about sixty miles from Bukharest in the\r\nCarpathian Mountains. It is an imposing but gloomy edifice of gray\r\nstone and red brick, situated in a wild forest, and looks like a very\r\nancient, although it is a very modern castle. It has been surrounded\r\nby villas and hotels which attract the wealthy classes from Bukharest\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe lack of an heir to the throne of Roumania was supplied by the\r\nselection of Prince Ferdinand, a nephew of King Carol, and a son of\r\nPrince Leopold of Hohenzollern. He was born August 24, 1865, was\r\nproclaimed crown prince of Roumania in 1889, was married in 1893 to the\r\nPrincess Marie, daughter of the Duke of Albany, and a granddaughter of\r\nQueen Victoria. They have two sons, Carol, born in 1893, and Nicholas,\r\nborn in 1903, and three daughters.\r\n\r\nThe good people of Bukharest take great pride in their city and they\r\ncall it “the Paris of the Balkans.” So far as gayety and glamour and\r\nsin and wickedness are concerned the term applies. It might be said\r\nalso that the extravagance of everybody who has money to spend, the\r\nexorbitant prices that are imposed upon strangers for everything they\r\neat and drink and do, the giddy costumes and conduct of the feminine\r\npatrons of the cafés, and the gay crowds that pervade the streets from\r\nthe time the lamps are lighted until they are extinguished, are all\r\nquite up to the Paris standard. Men of experience assert that Bukharest\r\nis a wickeder city than Budapest, and that is saying a good deal. Every\r\nstranger is surprised to find such handsome residences, such luxurious\r\nhotels, such imposing public buildings and such fine mercantile houses\r\nand business blocks in the capital of so primitive a country as\r\nRoumania, and there is a striking contrast between the city and the\r\ncountry life in that little kingdom. Outside of the larger cities the\r\npeasants cling tenaciously to their ancient customs and costumes and\r\nhabits of life. No country in Europe, unless it be Dalmatia, has so\r\nmuch of what artists call “local colour.”\r\n\r\nIn the villages on market days you can see crowds of peasants, both\r\nmen and women, wearing the national dress, which is artistic and\r\nattractive. In Bukharest, however, the women wear Paris gowns and Paris\r\nhats, and the hobble skirt is as common these days as it is in any city\r\nof Europe. The extravagance of the people is seen on every block. The\r\ncafés are numerous, and they are always crowded; the public vehicles\r\nare smarter than any you see in London, or Paris, or New York, and\r\nthey are drawn by magnificent Russian horses, black as ebony, with\r\nlong, flowing manes and tails. The coachmen wear a gay livery--a long\r\ntunic of velvet, generally blue or black and heavily embroidered with\r\ngold braid. Nearly all of them are Russian exiles. They belong to a\r\ndissenting religious sect called the Skoptski, which is proscribed\r\nby the orthodox Greek Church. But the cab charges are quite as high\r\nas they are in New York, and twice as high as they are in Berlin. It\r\nis asserted that there are more automobiles in Bukharest than in any\r\nother European city in proportion to the population, and there are\r\ntaxicabs galore.\r\n\r\nThe hotels are as fine as any in Europe and their charges are higher\r\nthan those of Paris or New York. Everything is French--French cooks,\r\nFrench waiters, French bills of fare--and French charges. A friend\r\nwho came straight to Bukharest from Monte Carlo and occupied similar\r\nrooms at the most expensive of the hotels at both places asserts that\r\nthe charges at Bukharest were 15 and 25 per cent. higher than at Monte\r\nCarlo.\r\n\r\nOne is surprised at the number of jewellery stores and the gorgeous\r\ndisplays of diamonds and other precious stones, which are pointed out\r\nas evidence of the extravagance of the people, and it goes without\r\nsaying that merchants would not offer such things for sale unless\r\nthere was a demand for them. We did not have an opportunity to see the\r\nwomen of Bukharest in full dress, but from the toilettes displayed\r\nat the cafés and at other public places one can infer what might be\r\nseen indoors on occasions of display. The Roumanian women are famous\r\nfor their dress and for their good looks. It has been said that they\r\ncombine the beauty of the Magyar, the grace of the Viennese, the style\r\nof the Parisienne and the passion of the Neapolitan. They are said to\r\nbe brilliant conversationalists also, quick of perception and nimble\r\nof wit. Most women of the upper class are educated at home by French\r\ngovernesses, who do not contribute so much to their intellectual as to\r\ntheir social attractions. As one broad-minded gentleman put it, “the\r\nRoumanian girl is a natural flirt. She can’t help it, and her French\r\ngoverness adds refinement to the art and makes her self-confident to\r\nrecklessness.”\r\n\r\nIt is not fair, to judge women or men upon a short acquaintance,\r\nand, although the stranger who visits Bukharest for a few days must\r\nnecessarily carry away an impression of frivolity and extravagance, I\r\nam very sure there must be an undercurrent of earnestness and goodness\r\nwhere there is so much froth. The cafés are always open and one would\r\nthink that the people of Bukharest never go to bed. The population is\r\nabout the same as that of Washington, but there are ten times as many\r\nstreet lamps, twenty times as many restaurants and cafés, and twice as\r\nmany theatres. The gambling houses are wide open, and it is said that\r\nvery high stakes prevail. The Roumanians are a nation of gamblers and\r\nmany Russians go to Bukharest to play. They find much to attract them\r\nin other respects, and perhaps the reputation of the city has been\r\ninjured by visitors from other lands.\r\n\r\nIn Bukharest one can hear genuine Tzigany orchestras and genuine gypsy\r\nmusic, of which that heard in London and New York is only a mild\r\nimitation. In every restaurant and café there is a band--sometimes only\r\ntwo or three and sometimes a dozen musicians--constantly playing those\r\nravishing rag-time barbaric melodies that have been conceived in the\r\nsemi-savage brains of some gypsy genius. Occasionally a Tzigany girl\r\nsings to the accompaniment of the orchestra, wild, weird strains of the\r\nnative music, which cannot be transplanted without losing its force and\r\nfascination. While we cannot understand the words, the meaning of the\r\nmusic is as plain as if it were written in English capital letters.\r\n\r\nThe Roumanian language is more like the Italian than the Russian,\r\nand has a Latin origin, because the population of the country is\r\ndescended from the Roman legions that were sent up in the year 104\r\nA.D. by the Emperor Trajan to hold the barbarians at bay and the\r\nname of the country is properly “Roman-ia.” It is a liquid language\r\nand flows freely off the tongues of the people, who talk faster than\r\nany Frenchman you ever saw and gesticulate like the Italians. If any\r\none should hold the hands of a Roumanian woman she would become dumb\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the business section is solid and regular, and\r\nwould remind you of Frankfort, or Leipzig, or Dresden, or any city\r\nof similar size on the European continent, but the shop windows are\r\nmore like those of Paris. We were told that the merchants put nearly\r\nall their goods in their windows, and that may be true, but they\r\ncertainly arrange them with a great deal of taste. There is a number of\r\nnewspapers, all intensely partisan, including a humorous publication\r\nof merit. Its cartoons are equal to those of any of the German funny\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nThere are two universities in the country, and the government pays\r\n39,000,000 francs ($7,800,000) for the support of the schools.\r\nEducation is free and compulsory, but there is a lamentable lack of\r\nschools in the rural districts, so that the purpose of the educational\r\nprovision in the constitution is not fully carried out. Nearly 70 per\r\ncent. of the young men who report for military service can neither read\r\nnor write and only a little more than half the school population is in\r\nactual attendance.\r\n\r\nThe University of Bukharest has 3,443 students and the University\r\nof Jassy has 629. There are schools for engineering, agriculture,\r\nforestry, and art. There are various technical schools in the larger\r\ncities, all of them under the care of the general government, and\r\nthey are well attended. The administration of King Carol is as\r\nthorough as the Germans in promoting technical education and in\r\nintroducing scientific theories into practice in municipal and national\r\nadministration. Many of the young men go to Paris or to Berlin for\r\npost-graduate courses, and several of them have become distinguished in\r\nscience, literature, music, and art. The Roumanian taste for painting\r\nis as bizarre as that for music. The pictures by native artists in the\r\nart stores and galleries of Bukharest are vivid in colour and action\r\nand daring in their conceptions.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of politics in Roumania, and partisanship usually\r\nencourages radical measures during political campaigns. But King Carol\r\nis more than a figurehead. He takes a deep interest in diplomatic and\r\nlegislative affairs, and has recently concluded negotiations for an\r\nalliance with Turkey, Austria, and Germany against the other Balkan\r\nstates, England, and Greece. Although Roumania has the same religion,\r\nneither the government nor the people have much political sympathy with\r\ntheir neighbours in Bulgaria, Macedonia, Servia, and Greece, and in\r\ncase of war between Greece and Turkey, Roumania would undoubtedly be\r\nfound on the side of the latter. The influence of Austria and Germany\r\nis much greater in Roumania than that of any other nation, which is not\r\nunnatural, as the king is a German, and a near relative of the kaiser.\r\n\r\nThe Roumanian army, for its size, is often said to be the best in\r\nEurope. The king is a trained soldier and has taken an active personal\r\ninterest in its organization and equipment. But the people grumble at\r\nthe expense. The standing army for a nation of 6,000,000 people here\r\nis precisely as large as that of the United States, with a population\r\nof 80,000,000, not including 200,000 reserves, who are paid full wages\r\nfor two months in the year, when they are in camp. The army of Roumania\r\ncosts more than $15,000,000 a year, which is almost equal to $2.50 of\r\ntaxation per capita upon every man, woman and child in the country.\r\n\r\nRoumania is fortunate in having unusually rich resources. The wide\r\nplains in the valley of the Danube produce enormous crops of grain and\r\nare cultivated with American machinery. Several of the manufacturers\r\nof agricultural implements in the United States have branch houses,\r\nwhose sales mount into the millions every year. Roumania is the most\r\nprofitable market for American agricultural implements in Europe\r\nexcepting Russia and Hungary. The farms are large and are owned by a\r\nlanded aristocracy--there are no orders of nobility in the country--who\r\nlive in a feudal state and have armies of retainers born and brought\r\nup on the soil they cultivate. The land owners are called boyards--the\r\nsame term is used in Russia--and the profits they make from their lands\r\nare expended in maintaining handsome and extravagant establishments in\r\nBukharest.\r\n\r\nThere are enormous flocks of sheep also, mounting into millions,\r\nand immense herds of cattle scattered among the foothills and on\r\nthe mountain slopes. The sheep and cattle barons of Roumania have\r\nresidences in Bukharest also, and spend a great deal of their money\r\nthere. Few of them ever try to live on their ranches, which are in\r\ncharge of overseers, and they do nothing to improve the condition\r\nof their labourers or to provide them with schools or even decent\r\nhabitations. The farm villages throughout the country are in a\r\nprimitive condition--worse than those of Ireland. They have not\r\nbeen improved for centuries, but the peasants are not unhappy or\r\ndiscontented and they do not know that their condition could be\r\nbettered. The Greek priests keep them in order and exercise a similar\r\ninfluence to that of the Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland and Italy,\r\nand while they have the credit of being honest and earnest, most of\r\nthem are uneducated and some are actually illiterate. I was told that\r\nthere was scarcely a hundred university men among the entire clergy of\r\nthe orthodox Greek church in Roumania, although there are nearly seven\r\nthousand churches, six bishops, two archbishops and a patriarch, who is\r\nat the head of the spiritual system of the country.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of petroleum of a high grade and two or three German\r\ncorporations are refining it, but the exports are small owing to the\r\ninability of local refiners to compete with the Standard Oil Company.\r\nThe market is practically limited to Roumania and the adjacent\r\ncountries. Several years ago the Standard Oil Company tried to obtain\r\ncontrol of the Roumanian wells in order to get a more complete command\r\nof the market in the East, in competition with the Russian producers\r\nat Baku; but the Germans had more influence with the government and\r\nkept the Americans out. There is a disposition among business men here\r\nto regret the outcome of that transaction, because they believe the\r\nStandard Oil Company would have made a great deal more petroleum than\r\nthe Germans have ever done, and would have contributed in a larger\r\ndegree to the prosperity of the country. The government officials\r\nsympathize with this view of the case, and if the Standard Oil Company\r\nshould again attempt to secure control of the industry in Roumania it\r\nwould have the encouragement of the administration and the business\r\norganizations. The German refiners are doing practically nothing in the\r\nway of improvement and expansion, and are actually letting their plants\r\nrun down.\r\n\r\nIn no country has the Jewish race suffered more brutal and relentless\r\npersecution than in Roumania, and as elsewhere it has been more from\r\neconomic than from religious motives. It is true that synagogues have\r\nbeen plundered and polluted; laws have been passed and regulations have\r\nbeen framed to hinder believers from performing their rites of worship.\r\nOn holidays, Good Friday, and anniversaries of the saints, fanatical\r\nmobs have often attacked quarters in which Jewish families have lived,\r\nbut these have been mere incidents in a general campaign that has\r\ncontinued for a thousand years for the purpose of disabling the Jew\r\nfrom competition with his Christian rivals in commerce, industry, and\r\nthe professions. That is the secret of all the Jewish persecution in\r\nRussia to-day and everywhere else that this remarkable race suffers\r\nfrom discrimination under the laws and the prejudices of society.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Jews were among the earliest inhabitants of\r\nRoumanian territory. After the destruction of Jerusalem and the\r\ndispersion of its inhabitants by the Roman Emperor Titus many families\r\nfound their way into what are now Roumania, Hungary and Austria, and\r\nmany more followed the Roman legions, who occupied this country a\r\nhundred years after the Christian era, and settled in different places\r\nfavourable to their trade. They were treated with favour in early\r\ndays, many became rich and influential, but shared the lot of the\r\nwhole population which was subjected to the caprice and the tyranny\r\nof the semi-barbarous rulers who succeeded to the throne. Jews were\r\nconspicuous in the professions as well as in finance and trade; they\r\noften occupied high places under the government and were honoured\r\nwith the confidence of kings as well as that of the public generally.\r\nThey played an important rôle in state affairs, but all men of wealth\r\nsuffered blackmail in those days and were the prey of greedy and\r\nimpecunious princes. It was not until the development of civilization\r\nin the eighteenth century that the Jewish population was singled out\r\nfor special attention. Then they were made objects of insult and\r\npersecution, but it was not until the nineteenth century that they\r\nwere deprived of any of the rights that other men enjoyed in commerce\r\nand trade. Jews were allowed to live in all the cities, villages, and\r\nmarket towns and to engage in all the crafts and lines of commerce.\r\nThey were permitted to join the guilds of artisans and merchants on an\r\nequal footing with Christians, and their skill, ability, and sagacity\r\nenabled them to acquire special privileges, favours and influence.\r\nThey engaged in all of the professions; they were physicians, lawyers,\r\nbankers, merchants, manufacturers, distillers, goldsmiths, and their\r\nrepresentatives were found in every occupation.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons during the earlier part of the nineteenth century\r\nthe Jews were accused of crimes and conspiracies, and in 1821 a\r\ntremendous storm broke out against them. Their homes were pillaged and\r\nburned, their business houses were looted; men, and even women and\r\nchildren, were stoned in the streets, and no protection was given them\r\nin the courts or by the police. Taxes were doubled; they were forbidden\r\nto engage in certain trades or live in certain towns and cities; they\r\nwere compelled to wear a distinctive costume; they were arrested on\r\ntrivial pretexts and compelled to pay heavy fines, and property owners\r\nwere prohibited from renting shops and stores and houses to them. But\r\nwhen the Revolution of 1848 broke out the Jews took an active part in\r\nit, contributed liberally to the cause of liberty and were among the\r\nleaders of the movement which accomplished so much for the freedom of\r\nthe people. Their services were recognized at the time, but no sooner\r\nwas the kingdom of Roumania recognized in 1866 than a methodical and\r\nthorough system of persecution was adopted, which has continued until\r\nthe present day. It has been intended to drive the Jewish population,\r\nwhich numbers about a quarter of a million, from Roumania, to deprive\r\nthem of their property and savings and to relieve the native members\r\nof the professions and occupations from rivals with whom they cannot\r\ncompete. The motive, as I have said, is purely business, and religion\r\nhas not been offered even as a pretext.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of King Carol when he came to the throne of\r\nRoumania in 1866 was to provide a constitution which guarantees civil\r\nand religious equality and freedom to all citizens of Roumania; free\r\ncompulsory education, the right of petition, the right of public\r\nmeetings, and specifically provides that the difference of religious\r\ncreeds shall not be used as a ground for exclusion or incapacity in the\r\nenjoyment of civil and political rights or the exercise of any of the\r\nprofessions, trades, or industries.\r\n\r\nThese provisions were still further guaranteed by the powers of Europe\r\nin a treaty signed by all of them at Berlin at the close of the war\r\nbetween Russia and Turkey in 1878. Article thirty-four of that treaty\r\nspecifically mentions the Jews. This treaty proclaimed the equality of\r\nall creeds before the law for the special purpose of regulating the\r\nJewish question in Roumania, but its provisions were promptly nullified\r\non the pretext that all persons living in Roumania who did not profess\r\nthe Christian religion were aliens and therefore the provisions did not\r\napply to them.\r\n\r\nThis theory has been the basis of all legislation and regulation\r\nin Roumania since that time. The Jewish subjects of Roumania who\r\nhad assisted in the revolution for liberty, who had been cordially\r\ncommended by their neighbours and their king, disappeared from\r\nexistence with a stroke of the pen. Thenceforth there were no Roumanian\r\nJews, and all Jews who happened to be in Roumania were declared outlaw\r\naliens, not subject to protection.\r\n\r\nTo emphasize this action a series of raids upon Jewish settlements was\r\norganized, and the hunting down of the Jews began. The most brutal\r\natrocities were committed. Thousands of families were driven from their\r\nhomes, and in many cases their houses were burned over their heads.\r\nThese raids were led by officials and policemen and soldiers, and for\r\nmonths they were general throughout Roumania. The barbarities shocked\r\nthe Powers of Europe to such an extent that energetic remonstrances\r\nwere addressed to the Roumanian government, and a change of the\r\nministry occurred. But while the violence was suspended, except at\r\nintervals, the object of driving the Jews from Roumania was attempted\r\nby legislative measures.\r\n\r\nThe guarantee of protection in the Berlin treaty has never been\r\nrecognized. Every Jew has been declared an alien, although his\r\nancestors may have lived in the country for twenty centuries. No Jew\r\ncan be naturalized except by act of parliament; they are prohibited\r\nfrom holding government positions; they are not allowed to organize\r\ncorporations or joint stock companies; they are shut out of the learned\r\nprofessions; they cannot be bankers or brokers, agents or forwarders,\r\nor engage in any similar classes of business; they cannot engage in\r\nmanufacturing, and cannot work in factories; they cannot be employed\r\nupon railroads; and there is a law providing that no one shall employ a\r\nJew without also employing two Roumanians, which practically prohibits\r\nthem from earning wages in the small industries and on small farms.\r\n\r\nJews are prohibited from owning farm land, and the renting of land to\r\na Jew is forbidden. No Jew can keep a drug store, or be a veterinary\r\nsurgeon; they cannot be employed in the sanitary service of the state\r\nor municipality; they cannot be received as free patients in hospitals,\r\nexcept in cases of great urgency; no Jew can peddle merchandise in\r\nRoumania, or sell liquor, or tobacco, and nearly every other mercantile\r\noccupation is closed to them.\r\n\r\nThe free schools are for Roumanians only; Jews must pay tuition fees,\r\nand even then they cannot be admitted if Christian children want\r\ntheir places. A law passed in 1898 debars Jews from all professional\r\nand agricultural schools and admits them only to schools of commerce\r\nand of the arts and trades to the number of one fifth of the average\r\nattendance, and then they must pay tuition, where Christian students\r\nare admitted free. Where they have founded schools of their own they\r\nare hampered with the most exasperating regulations and are required to\r\nkeep open on Saturdays and on other Jewish holidays.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Jewish population is not recognized by law, the young men\r\nare compelled to serve their time in the army, just as if they had a\r\nlegal existence, but no Jew can be an officer; they are excluded from\r\npensions, and in barracks and camp they are required to perform menial\r\nservice, to clean the streets and the closets and to carry off the\r\ngarbage.\r\n\r\nA Jew has no standing in court; his testimony is not accepted; when he\r\nis a defendant he has no right to employ counsel or question a jury.\r\nIt is not necessary to recite other features of the peculiar laws and\r\nregulations which are intended to drive the Jews from Roumania by\r\nmaking it impossible for them to earn a living there. It is sufficient\r\nto say that a Jew is not recognized as having a legal existence; he is\r\nan object of persecution as well as contempt and has no redress for any\r\nill treatment he may suffer in body, mind or estate.\r\n\r\nThese persecutions have driven a large proportion of the Jewish people\r\nfrom Roumania to the United States and other countries. Emigration\r\nis their only hope, and the number of arrivals at the ports of the\r\nUnited States in 1902 caused Secretary Hay to call the attention of the\r\ncivilized world to the inhuman treatment of that race in Roumania by\r\nmaking a formal protest. The pretext for this unusual action was the\r\nlarge number of emigrants that had been driven to this country under\r\nconditions which rendered them unfit for citizens of the United States\r\nand were likely to make them a burden upon public and private charity.\r\n\r\nSecretary Hay’s protest caused a tremendous sensation throughout the\r\ndiplomatic world, and was discussed everywhere, but no official action\r\nwas taken by any European government in regard to the matter, and\r\nthe only beneficial effect was to direct the eyes of the world upon\r\nRoumania and thus cause a cessation of the persecutions for the time\r\nbeing. Since then the treatment of the Jewish subjects of Roumania has\r\nnot been so cruel as before, although no law has been repealed and no\r\nrestriction has been modified. The tide of immigration has recently\r\nbeen turned from the United States to Turkey, where the government\r\nhas invited Jewish colonists to settle in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia,\r\nSyria, and other parts of the empire. And there are large schemes of\r\nbenevolence to transplant as many as can find room upon the unoccupied\r\nlands of Turkey.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this persecution, the Jews of Roumania seem to be\r\nflourishing. They are still the leading business men of that country,\r\nand in the coast cities they show evidence of prosperity.\r\n\r\nA large business in the way of grain exporting is done at Constanza\r\nand other ports. All the export grain goes out that way, but more\r\nthan half the crop is sent up the Danube on barges to Budapest, which\r\nmanufactures almost as much flour as Minneapolis.\r\n\r\nThe railway from Budapest via Bukharest to the Black Sea is the\r\nshortest route from central Europe to Constantinople, although it is\r\nnecessary for passengers to change to a steamer at Constanza. The\r\nsteamers are fast and comfortable, sailing promptly in connection with\r\nthe trains three nights in the week, so that the journey can be made\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nSouth of Constanza are two or three Bulgarian ports which also handle\r\na good deal of grain, which is shipped in bags, and not in bulk, as\r\nin the United States, by various lines of steamers to Marseilles and\r\nGenoa. The Black Sea region probably exports more wheat than any other\r\npart of the world except the United States and the Argentine Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians have a summer resort on the Black Sea called Varna,\r\nwhich is well patronized by the wealthier classes, and is said to be\r\nvery attractive. The king of Bulgaria has a villa there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW RÉGIME IN TURKEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new government of Turkey is doing as well as could be expected,\r\nnotwithstanding the many embarrassments which are perfectly natural\r\nunder the circumstances. It has been properly said that the greatest\r\nevil which Abdul Hamid inflicted upon his country was by depriving it\r\nof men of capacity, trained to exercise the functions of government.\r\nHis policy of centralization, the monopoly of administration which he\r\nkept in his own hands, and the small number of subordinates who were\r\nentrusted with responsibility, has resulted in a lack of experience and\r\nknowledge which is being realized now for the first time in its full\r\nsignificance. Almost everybody agrees that the leaders of the Young\r\nTurk party, and the cabinet ministers they have selected, represent the\r\nbest sentiment of the country, and that a better class of officials\r\ncould not be found. They are honest and disinterested to a degree which\r\nhas been unknown before in Turkish history. They are full of good\r\nintentions and their greatest fault, or rather weakness, is shrinking\r\nfrom responsibility. The people have expected much and have received\r\nlittle or nothing.\r\n\r\nPeople complain that it is more difficult to do business with the\r\ngovernment now than it was under the old régime because now a\r\ncontractor has to deal with forty different people, when formerly\r\nhe had to deal with one. Now, if he fails to consult or overlooks\r\nsome official who has to do with the case, or neglects to show that\r\ndeference which the sub-deputy assistant to some minister expects, he\r\nmakes an enemy for life, and his business is blocked beyond relief.\r\nAnd, although the prevailing opinion gives the new government an\r\nexcellent reputation for integrity, there are still skeptics who insist\r\nthat the bribes are passed under the table instead of over it, as was\r\nformerly the case.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely to be expected that a nation will change its habits in\r\na day. The payment of “baksheesh” has been customary in Turkey since\r\nthe beginning of time, and the practice was not only tolerated but\r\nrecognized as legitimate by the former government. Abdul Hamid, for\r\nexample, expected the ambassadors and ministers of foreign powers to\r\npay the salaries of the officials of the foreign office with whom\r\nthey had to deal, which relieved him of the necessity of paying them\r\nhimself, and the same system prevailed through the entire government.\r\nNobody ever went to a Turkish official for a favour without bringing\r\na gift. That has always been the custom in all Oriental countries,\r\neven in Bible times, and the value of the gift must correspond with\r\nthe value of the favour desired. No one who understands the Oriental\r\ncharacter would concede that this practice had been entirely abandoned\r\nat the sublime porte, although the ministers and the other men high\r\nin authority are believed to be incorruptible. Mr. Crawford, the\r\nEnglishman who is in charge of the customs, has made it perfectly plain\r\nto the employés of that department, that any man who accepts a bribe\r\nfrom an importer must hand in his resignation at the same time. There\r\nhas undoubtedly been a great improvement in this respect. The delay\r\nin granting concessions for public works, therefore, is not due to the\r\nreasons which might have prevailed in the old régime, but merely to\r\nindecision on the part of the officials, who have never been accustomed\r\nto decide questions of importance for themselves and hesitate to\r\ndo so for fear they may be criticised. They try to shoulder the\r\nresponsibility upon somebody else or, as the saying goes, to provide a\r\nscreen behind which they may hide in case they are criticised. These\r\ndelays have been the greatest fault of the administration.\r\n\r\nThe next most serious cause of complaint is the failure of the\r\ngovernment to require the governors of provinces and other local\r\nofficials to go ahead and carry out plans for the benefit of the\r\npeople. It is conceded that the character and ability of the local\r\nofficials have been greatly improved. Better governors have been\r\nselected, and they have been cautioned that their tenure of office\r\ndepends upon their behaviour. The provincial magistrates no longer\r\ndepend upon blackmail for a living. Formerly a governor bought his\r\nposition and used it to reimburse himself for past expenditures and to\r\nprovide for his future. While he was robbing the people and feathering\r\nhis own nest, nothing was done for the benefit of the public. No roads\r\nwere built or bridges repaired and none of the revenues were spent\r\nfor the general welfare. To-day, things are supposed to be different,\r\nand the governors have been instructed to drain the marshes, build\r\nroads and bridges, to improve the prisons and the barracks, to provide\r\nschools and repair the mosques; but they do not act. They are afraid\r\nof responsibility. They cannot get rid of habits formed under the old\r\nrégime, when no governor dared do anything without first reporting\r\nhis intentions to the sultan and securing his majesty’s approval and\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nThere are some exceptions. Certain governors have acted promptly\r\nand have received the cordial commendation of the ministry at\r\nConstantinople. Their work has been publicly commended in the Chamber\r\nof Deputies and it is probable that these examples will be regarded as\r\nprecedents and imitated by others.\r\n\r\nThe greatest amount of trouble from this source is found in the eastern\r\nportion of Asia Minor, where ignorance and fanaticism are universal\r\nand where the people need public works more than any other community.\r\nThey have given the new régime their cordial indorsement; they have\r\nbeen told that the new government will give them roads by which they\r\ncan take their produce to market; schools in which their children may\r\nbe educated; bridges over the streams and other modern improvements,\r\nand they have waited patiently for more than a year for something to\r\nhappen; but there is “nothing doing,” and the peasants are beginning to\r\nhave their doubts as to the sincerity of the government, which, if it\r\ngoes much further, will result in repudiation and revolution.\r\n\r\nOne great benefit which the peasants enjoy, however, and the importance\r\nof which they recognize, is the abolition of the passport system, which\r\nprohibited the resident of one village from visiting another without\r\nthe permission of the police. Now any one can go wherever he pleases\r\nat any time without interference from the authorities and no questions\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nAnother great improvement has been in the character and the conduct\r\nof the gendarmes or national police, who are under the direction\r\nof the minister of the interior, with local commanders who report\r\nto the governors of the provinces. Formerly the gendarmes were the\r\nbrutal tools of tyranny. Every massacre was led by them. They were\r\nblackmailers, robbers, despoilers of homes, ravishers of women, and\r\nmurderers, and their uniforms protected them from punishment. Since the\r\nnew government came in there has been an almost universal change in\r\nthe personnel of the police, and the present force is made up largely\r\nof veteran soldiers with honourable records. The most intelligent and\r\nreliable men have been detailed for the service, and as a rule they are\r\nhonest, conscientious and anxious to perform their duties properly.\r\n\r\nThere are several schools for training them similar to those adopted\r\nby the foreign officials in Macedonia. They are taught by European\r\nofficers, and the first lesson is to convince them that they must\r\ncommand and deserve the respect of the people. It is perfectly natural\r\nthat they should be regarded with jealousy by the zaptiehs and spies of\r\nthe old régime, but there has been very little complaint and they are\r\nwinning golden opinions.\r\n\r\nAnother serious mistake of the new government has been the treatment\r\nof the Albanians, who were greatly favoured by Abdul Hamid and are\r\nhaughty, independent, fearless mountaineers, very difficult to deal\r\nwith. They are only semi-civilized, and their province is probably the\r\nmost primitive in all Europe. Instead of giving them roads, railways\r\nand schools of their own and cultivating their good will, the new\r\ngovernment has antagonized the Albanians from the start. They were\r\nrecognized as favourites and adherents of the old sultan, and the\r\nAlbanian regiments, which formed his body-guard and received four\r\ntimes the pay of the ordinary soldier, were disbanded and sent home\r\nto make mischief. An unwise governor issued an order requiring the\r\nuse of the Turkish language exclusively in all the Albanian schools,\r\nwhich was the most offensive act that could have been committed. The\r\nAlbanian representatives in the Chamber of Deputies protested and in\r\nvain. They had thrown in their lot with the reformers and had offered\r\ntheir support to the government, but the government would not trust\r\nthem and treated them as enemies. Hence an insurrection which stirred\r\nup the entire province, cost several hundred lives and hundreds of\r\nthousands of dollars. An armed peace has been restored, but no attempt\r\nhas been made to improve the condition of the Albanians. The ruins of\r\nthe villages that have been burned and the graves of the neighbours\r\nthat have been killed will be perpetual reminders of what the Albanians\r\nconsider to be a tyrannical and unjust treatment of their province.\r\n\r\nA similar mistake was made in Macedonia, where the sympathy of the\r\npeople was so strongly on the side of their nextdoor neighbours, the\r\nAlbanians, that the government feared a revolution. Instead of trying\r\nto prevent it by giving the Macedonians new roads and schools and other\r\npublic improvements they need so much, an order was issued to disarm\r\nthe entire population. Comparatively few guns have been surrendered\r\nand even a smaller number have been found by searching parties. The\r\nrest are buried in the woods, ready for use whenever a favourable\r\nopportunity is offered to show their resentment against the new\r\ngovernment. It would not be difficult to point out other mistakes,\r\nbut none so serious as these. And, taking all in all, there has been\r\na decided improvement in conditions. The finances are in good shape;\r\nthe taxes are honestly collected and the money is honestly expended.\r\nThe increase in the revenues is remarkable and the importers and other\r\ntax-payers no longer complain of favouritism.\r\n\r\nAnother sign of progress is the respect which the officials show\r\nto the public, and that is much appreciated. There is still some\r\ncomplaint concerning the administration of justice, but such troubles\r\nwill naturally correct themselves with changes in the personnel of\r\nthe judiciary. At any rate, the least that can be said is that the\r\ncourts are no longer used for political purposes or for blackmail or\r\npersecution. The present government is the best Turkey has ever had,\r\nand as Sir Edwin Pears, the venerable correspondent of the London\r\n_Times_, says: “Its faults are those of inexperience which time will\r\ncure. Experience will give the ministers greater courage to accept\r\nresponsibility, and they and the masses of the people are gradually\r\ngaining confidence in each other and in themselves.”\r\n\r\nThere has always been a department of education in the Turkish\r\nadministration, but it has never amounted to anything until now. The\r\npresent minister is an earnest, ambitious, conscientious man, who\r\nrealizes the illiterate condition of the people and the importance\r\nof education. And he has begun the organization of a free public\r\nschool system throughout the entire empire, to be supported by local\r\ntaxation, with subsidies from the imperial treasury. The parliament\r\nappropriated $4,300,000 for the year 1910, of which one sixth was paid\r\nto private schools and the remainder was allotted to public educational\r\ninstitutions and the free public schools throughout the empire. It is\r\nexpected that this amount will be increased gradually year by year as\r\nthe revenues will permit. The spirit shown by members of Parliament\r\npromises generous grants in the future.\r\n\r\nD. J. Mahmoud Bey, the inspector general of public instruction, told me\r\nthat there would be about 65,000 elementary public schools in operation\r\nthroughout the Turkish Empire before the end of 1910, and that number\r\nwill be increased as rapidly as possible. The greatest difficulty is\r\nto get teachers. Indeed, that is the only obstacle to the extension of\r\nthe system. Mahmoud Bey says the inhabitants of the various provinces\r\nare “crazy” for schools, and are willing to pay any amount of taxes\r\nwithin their power to secure them. But there are no teachers to be\r\nhad. The salaries that can be allowed will not tempt educated men away\r\nfrom other professions and there are so few educated women in the\r\ncountry that it is almost impossible to find instructors for the girls’\r\nschools. Mohammedan girls cannot attend mixed schools and cannot be\r\ntaught by men.\r\n\r\n“We have just started two large normal schools in Constantinople for\r\nthe education of teachers,” said Mahmoud Bey, “and will establish\r\nothers in the provinces as rapidly as possible. It will be at least\r\ntwo years and probably three years before any of the students from\r\nthese schools will be available for teachers, and in the meantime we\r\nwill have to do the best we can. We are getting some teachers from the\r\nAmerican missionary schools in different parts of Turkey, although they\r\nare, of course, reluctant to let their teachers go. We are placing\r\npromising young men and women in all the American institutions, to be\r\neducated at government expense. We have five government students in\r\nthe American College for Girls at Scutari. We shall have as many or\r\nmore young men in Robert College at the opening of the fall term. We\r\nhave already sent 150 students to Vienna, Paris, Berlin, Geneva and\r\nother European educational centres at government expense. These young\r\nmen are selected from the most promising students in our high schools.\r\nWe will send more next year. We expect to send twenty-five, perhaps\r\nfifty, young men to America to be educated. We like the American system\r\nof education very much, but in the organization of our public schools\r\nwe are adopting the German and Swiss systems rather than the American\r\nbecause it is more easily applied.\r\n\r\n“There is a great educational renaissance in Turkey,” continued Mahmoud\r\nBey. “The deputies of our parliament are here every day demanding more\r\nschools for their constituents. One of them who was in this morning\r\nsaid that the people in his province were ‘actually screaming for\r\nschools.’ The deputy from Mesopotamia has just sent me a copy of a\r\nspeech he has recently made in approval of our efforts and promising\r\nhis earnest support for us in the future.”\r\n\r\nThe appropriations for 1910 were divided as follows--a piaster being\r\nfive cents in American money:\r\n\r\n                                              Piasters.\r\n  Subventions to primary schools             20,000,000\r\n  Subventions to secondary schools           12,000,000\r\n  Government primary schools                  3,000,000\r\n  Government lyceums                          3,000,000\r\n  Government normal schools                   2,453,820\r\n  Subventions to provincial normal schools    3,000,000\r\n  Subventions to provincial lyceums           4,000,000\r\n  University of Constantinople                2,928,816\r\n  Agricultural schools                        3,636,000\r\n  Medical schools                             8,502,200\r\n  Schools of music and art                    1,030,000\r\n  Technical schools                           7,839,000\r\n  Schools of commerce                         2,670,120\r\n  Students in private schools                 5,190,000\r\n\r\nThe several military academies are supported from the appropriations\r\nfor the war department. The provincial schools referred to in the\r\nabove table are situated in forty or fifty of the largest centres\r\nof population in the different provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The\r\nlyceums are what we call high or preparatory schools. Schools of\r\ncommerce are what we call commercial colleges where modern languages,\r\nbookkeeping, typewriting, stenography, and other accomplishments\r\nrequired in a business career are taught.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Imperial University was established in Stamboul, the\r\nnative part of Constantinople, by the ex-sultan, Abdul Hamid, in 1904,\r\nwith six departments--law, medicine, politics, theology, literature,\r\nand natural sciences. It was a concession to the orthodox and loyal\r\nfamilies of the Moslem faith who were determined that their sons should\r\nhave a liberal education, but were reluctant to send them to the\r\nAmerican missionary colleges or to the European universities. Hundreds\r\nof Turkish young men have been going to the universities of Paris,\r\nGeneva, Berlin, Vienna, and Budapest, and at those institutions have\r\nacquired liberal and revolutionary doctrines which made them dangerous\r\nto the despotism. Abdul Hamid was opposed to education in every form,\r\nparticularly among the middle and lower classes of his subjects,\r\nbecause it made them troublesome and discontented, but he threw a tub\r\nto the whale, as it were, by starting a university of his own about\r\nfour years before his downfall. It did not amount to much under his\r\nreign, but since the Young Turks came into power it has branched out\r\nconsiderably and promises to be an institution of importance.\r\n\r\nThere are now about twenty-five hundred students in the various\r\ndepartments, and a faculty of two hundred professors, most of them\r\ncompetent men, but only a few have had experience in instruction. For\r\nthe year 1910, the appropriation for the support of the university was\r\nthree million piasters, which is equivalent to $150,000 in American\r\nmoney--a sum that is ample to meet the present demands.\r\n\r\nThe university occupies the former palace of Kiamil Pasha, near the\r\nmosque of Sultan Bayazid, on one of the highest and best positions in\r\nthe city. While the building is not at all adapted to the purpose, it\r\nis a costly and highly decorated mansion, and when the Cheragan Palace,\r\noccupied by the parliament, was burned in 1909, it was proposed to turn\r\nout the university and use the Kiamil Palace as a parliament house.\r\nFortunately the minister of public education was able to head off the\r\nplan, because he would have found it very difficult to find even so\r\ngood, or so poor a place in Constantinople for the institution. Plans\r\nhave been made for a new building to cost five million dollars, but\r\nit will be a long time before the Turkish treasury can afford such an\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nThe largest branch of the university is the law department, called\r\nthe Mektebi Hookouk, where an average of more than a thousand young\r\nmen are attending lectures to prepare themselves for the bar, and\r\nfor employment by the government as magistrates and in other legal\r\ncapacities. Many of these young men finish their courses at the\r\nSorbonne, Paris, and other European institutions. More attention is\r\npaid to the Shariat, the Mohammedan code, than to European law, because\r\nthat prevails throughout the entire Ottoman Empire, and is based\r\nentirely upon the Koran. Several propositions have been offered for the\r\nappointment of a commission to modernize this code, that it may better\r\napply to everyday affairs, but thus far the Mohammedan priests have\r\nbeen able to head them off.\r\n\r\nThe law school is open to students of all nationalities. The\r\nmatriculation fee is $5.00 and there are similar fees for tuition and\r\nfor each examination, which makes the total charge $15.00 for the first\r\nyear. Parliament has passed a law authorizing the officials of the\r\nuniversity to waive the fees of students who bring certificates from\r\nlocal magistrates that they are competent and worthy to attend the\r\nlectures, but are not able to pay the charges. During the year 1910, 40\r\nper cent. of the students in the law department took advantage of this\r\nexemption.\r\n\r\nThere are about fifty instructors in the law school, and probably 2,500\r\ndifferent young men attend all or a part of the lectures during the\r\nyear, coming and going according to their convenience, but the average\r\nattendance does not exceed one thousand.\r\n\r\nThe next largest school is the Mektebi Milkieh, or school of politics,\r\nwhere attendance is obligatory and each student is required to appear\r\nat three lectures a day, except on Friday, which is the Moslem sabbath.\r\nThere are about three hundred students and nine professors, who are\r\nteaching the several languages spoken in the Turkish Empire, and other\r\ngeneral branches for the purpose of qualifying the graduates to fill\r\nofficial positions in the different provinces and in the various\r\ndepartments of the government. It is a training school for government\r\nemployés.\r\n\r\nThe Ulumi Dinieh, or theological department, has ten professors and\r\none hundred and forty students, who are being prepared for the Moslem\r\npriesthood. The methods of instruction are said to be considerably in\r\nadvance of those that prevail in the ordinary medresses, or seminaries.\r\nIn the latter the students simply commit to memory the Koran and\r\nstudy the commentators on that remarkable book. At the university the\r\ninstruction is broader and includes other branches of learning.\r\n\r\nThe medical department has nearly a thousand students and occupies\r\na separate building near the railway station in Haidar Pasha on the\r\nAsiatic side of the Bosphorus. This school was established many years\r\nago to train medical officers for the army and most of the instructors\r\nare Frenchmen and Greeks. There are several Germans also. The course\r\nof study covers five years and the examinations are said to be very\r\nstrict. There are schools of dentistry and pharmacy connected with the\r\nmedical department.\r\n\r\nThe department of natural sciences has ten instructors and ninety\r\nstudents, who are mostly engaged in studying chemistry, and the\r\ngraduates are employed in laboratories connected with the custom house,\r\narsenals, and other military depots. There does not seem to be any\r\nfixed course.\r\n\r\nThe school of literature includes everything else, a sort of omnibus,\r\nwhere a student may receive instruction in almost every branch. And\r\nthe department is divided into various schools of mathematics, modern\r\nlanguages, finance, engineering and fine arts. The latter has about\r\none hundred and fifty students under the direction of Vosgam Effendi,\r\na sculptor who has made a considerable reputation by his work.\r\nArchitecture, painting, sculpture, engraving, and etching are taught by\r\ntwelve instructors. The school occupies a building in the Seraglio near\r\nthe new museum.\r\n\r\nA normal school, called Dar-ul-Mouallumin, was added to the university\r\nin 1910, for the purpose of training teachers for the public schools\r\nthat have recently been established throughout the empire. The corps\r\nof instructors are mostly drawn from the American missionary schools,\r\nwhich have been accepted as models by the government, and to secure\r\nadmission to the normal schools students must have diplomas from one of\r\nthe branches of the university or from some American missionary school.\r\n\r\nThe best education to be had in Turkey outside of the American colleges\r\nhas been given by the military school at Constantinople. Nearly all\r\nthe leaders of the recent revolution were educated there. It was a\r\npet of Abdul Hamid and at times he treated it with great generosity.\r\nThe lyceum of Galata Serai, in the foreign quarter of Constantinople,\r\nhas been the only other native school where Turkish boys could get a\r\nrespectable education, and some of the best men in the Turkish service\r\nhave been educated there under a French principal and German and\r\nSwiss professors. The school had a bad reputation, however, among the\r\nautocrats. It was suspected of being a nursery for breeding enemies of\r\nthe despotism, and Abdul Hamid compelled several of his ministers to\r\ntake away their boys who had been sent there, because of the liberal\r\ntendencies of the faculty. Five or six years ago, the school was burned\r\ndown. It was a case of arson, and every body believed that the sultan\r\npaid one of his minions to set it on fire. He would never allow\r\nthe Galata Serai to be rebuilt, and the ruins lay undisturbed until\r\nthe Young Turk party came into power. Then the school was promptly\r\nreorganized and Fikret Bey, a Turkish scholar and poet and a member of\r\nthe faculty of Robert College, was appointed director. As soon as a new\r\nbuilding can be erected the school will resume its old importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of the Bosphorus; ancient castle of Mohammed the\r\nGreat in foreground]\r\n\r\nThere are several Roman Catholic schools in Constantinople, taught by\r\nthe Franciscan and Augustinian monks. There is a German school of some\r\nimportance and a dozen or more French schools, including a medical\r\ncollege. Its faculty have charge of the French hospital, which is the\r\nmost important institution of the kind in Turkey, and is patronized by\r\nmembers of the diplomatic corps from all countries. A large number of\r\nschools are supported by the Greek population, and some of them are\r\nattended by the children of Turkish families. There are probably more\r\nGreek schools than those of all the nations put together, and they are\r\nscattered in every part of the city. The French language is taught\r\nas well as Greek, because French is really the language of commerce,\r\ndiplomacy, and fashionable society in the East. If a stranger goes into\r\na bank, he is always addressed in the French language, and it is spoken\r\nby a larger number of the inhabitants of Constantinople than any other,\r\nexcept the Turkish.\r\n\r\nThe Armenians, the Jews, and the other different races have their own\r\nschools, which have been made necessary because of the absence of a\r\ngeneral educational system. And it is from the graduates of these\r\nschools that the Turkish government is now getting its supply of\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedan schools connected with the mosques are worthless for\r\na practical education. The teachers are priests, most of whom have\r\nno knowledge outside the Koran, which, to them, is the source of\r\nall light and learning and law and morals, and is regarded with as\r\nmuch reverence as the maxims of Confucius by the Chinese. Connected\r\nwith each medress, or theological seminary, are several ulemas, or\r\ntheologians, who are supposed to be profound thinkers and expound the\r\ndoctrines of the church to groups of students who gather around them\r\nin the different mosques. These students are called “softas” and there\r\nare said to be 7,000 of them in Constantinople to-day studying the\r\nKoran and the Shariat--a code of laws used, based upon the teachings\r\nof the Koran, which is the authority of every court in the empire.\r\nThese softas become priests, judges, notaries, valis, cadis, and other\r\nlocal officials. Many of them go into private practice, but there are\r\ncomparatively few lawyers in Turkey. A judge here gets the facts direct\r\nfrom the litigants who come before him and applies the law himself.\r\nThe softas are never taught geography or history or mathematics, and\r\nmost of them are so illiterate that they cannot read an ordinary book\r\nat sight. The text of the Koran would puzzle them if they had not been\r\nrequired to commit it to memory.\r\n\r\nThe English government has established a high school for boys, which\r\nwill accommodate about one hundred and fifty, with rooms for thirty or\r\nforty boarders. It is intended primarily for the education of the sons\r\nof English families living in Turkey, but is free to everybody who can\r\npay the fees. It is partially a charitable institution, and a fund of\r\n$50,000 has been contributed during past years by benevolent people to\r\nassist in the education of worthy young men who haven’t the means to\r\npay the fees.\r\n\r\nThus you will observe that the lack of government educational system\r\nin Turkey has been very largely supplied by foreigners, primarily for\r\nthe benefit of their own children, but often available for the natives\r\nalso. Most of these schools have been established and maintained in\r\ndefiance of the prejudice and the hostility of the late sultan, who was\r\nopposed to all forms of education and did his best to keep his subjects\r\nin ignorance as well as poverty.\r\n\r\nMr. Straus, the American ambassador, has recently succeeded in\r\ncorrecting a great wrong inflicted upon these institutions by Abdul\r\nHamid. He has obtained from the new government an irade authorizing\r\nall foreign schools and benevolent institutions to hold their property\r\nin their corporate name, instead of being compelled to place it in\r\nthe names of individuals, as heretofore. His predecessors in the\r\nembassy have been working for it for thirty years or more. He tried\r\nto get such a decision when he was occupying the same post during\r\nthe Cleveland administration, but Abdul Hamid was inflexible in his\r\nrefusal to do anything for the encouragement of education. The recent\r\ndecision of the council of state, secured by Mr. Straus, exempts\r\nall religious, benevolent and educational institutions founded and\r\nconducted by foreigners from the restrictions imposed upon other\r\nforeign corporations. It applies to about three hundred American\r\nschools, hospitals, colleges, orphanages, and asylums, and to as many\r\ninstitutions of the same kind supported by Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of searching the libraries of the mosques of\r\nConstantinople has long been coveted by the scholars of the world,\r\nbecause they are supposed to contain many ancient manuscripts of\r\nunique value and interest by Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, Egyptian,\r\nand Byzantine scholars and historians, but very few originals of\r\nliterary merit are likely to be found there. Constantinople has\r\nnever been renowned for its scholars or literary men. It never had a\r\nuniversity until recently. The ancient city of Khiva, far away to the\r\nnortheast, beyond the Caspian Sea and the deserts of Central Asia,\r\nwas a literary centre when Constantinople was the political capital\r\nof the world. Samarkand, Bokhara, and the cities of Asia Minor were\r\ncentres of learning and theological controversy when the thoughts\r\nof Constantinople were absorbed in military and political affairs.\r\nPractically all of the literary treasures in the libraries of this\r\ncity are the loot of a score of conquered nations. Most of them, when\r\nbrought home from the wars, were dumped at the mosques and other places\r\nwithout arrangement and generally without any appreciation of their\r\nvalue or knowledge of their contents. Several of the sultans had an\r\nappreciation of literary merit and encouraged science and art, but\r\nthis encouragement has never been continuous. More of them have been\r\niconoclasts, like the Caliph Omar, who used the books of the great\r\nlibrary at Alexandria, the greatest of its period, to heat the waters\r\nfor the public baths.\r\n\r\nMany of the manuscripts of the Alexandrian library were stolen, and\r\nsome of them, doubtless, found their way to Constantinople. There were\r\ncolonies of Greek and Roman scholars all along the coast of the Black\r\nSea, particularly at Trebizond and in the Crimea. Palestine was once\r\nrich in lore. Damascus, Antioch, Ephesus, Armenia, and several cities\r\nof Persia and Turkestan were well blessed with wise men--authors,\r\nphilosophers, theologians, mathematicians, poets, and essayists, and\r\nwere the seats of colleges and universities.\r\n\r\nNobody knows much about the libraries of Constantinople, however;\r\nnone of them have ever been catalogued; few of them have even been\r\nconsulted. The books are piled up on their sides in shelves and covered\r\nwith the dust of ages. The Mohammedan priests, who have charge of them,\r\nare usually illiterate men and look upon learning with superstition.\r\nThey can give no information concerning the volumes in their charge.\r\nOnly occasionally, when some scholar from Germany, England, or Italy\r\ncomes here, with sufficient patience and persistence to break through\r\nthe restrictions that have protected these collections, has anything of\r\ninterest ever been brought to light.\r\n\r\nThese unknown collections, however, are believed to contain early\r\ncopies of the Gospel, of the Greek poets, of the Egyptian geographers,\r\nthe Phœnician astrologers, and other ancient tomes, and probably within\r\na short time we will be able to learn something about them. The lost\r\nbooks of Livy are supposed to be in a collection of ancient manuscripts\r\nat what is called the topcapon or Cannongate of the Seraglio, the\r\nancient residence of the Turkish sultans.\r\n\r\nDr. Arminius Vámbéry, a Hungarian author, writer, and scholar of note,\r\nwho somehow or other made himself popular with Abdul Hamid, obtained\r\npermission to examine the Cannongate collection, and spent several\r\nweeks there. He afterward persuaded the sultan to let him take back\r\nto Hungary a number of historical manuscripts which were brought to\r\nConstantinople as loot from Budapest after the Turkish army sacked that\r\ncity in the Middle Ages. As it was strictly a personal matter between\r\nthe sultan and Dr. Vambery, there is no record of what the latter\r\ncarried away.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago an enterprising Russian scholar found his way into\r\nthe same library and secured a very early manuscript copy of the\r\nHexateuch, the first six books of the Bible. The manuscript was sent to\r\nthe Russian Institute at St. Petersburg, where it is now being edited\r\nfor publication.\r\n\r\nArthur Evans of London also got an opportunity to look over the books\r\nat the Cannongate a few months ago, and found a manuscript of great\r\nhistorical interest. It was a life of Mohammed II, by Critobolus, a\r\nGreek author, who accepted service under that sultan and became a sort\r\nof Boswell for him. His work is especially important because he was\r\nthe only Greek writer of importance in that period who belonged to the\r\nMohammedan faith and had an opportunity of consulting the Mohammedan\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong impression that the libraries at all the mosques\r\nhave been looted of their treasures from time to time, because the\r\nopportunity has not been lacking, and they have never been properly\r\nprotected. No one has been responsible for the library at that most\r\nfamous of all mosques, St. Sophia, which must have been very important\r\nat one time, but is now only a collection of bound manuscripts,\r\nnot more than three or four hundred in number, in the custody of a\r\nfanatical old priest. They have been kicked around the mosque and could\r\neasily have been looted by any one who was able to gain the confidence\r\nof the custodian. But all the libraries are amply protected now, and\r\nthe world of book lovers will soon have accurate information about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere have been conflicting reports about Abdul Hamid’s library at the\r\nYildiz Kiosk. It has been represented by some newspaper writers to be\r\nof incomparable value and importance. Others condemned it as a lot of\r\nrubbish. Mahmoud Bey told me that it contains about 40,000 printed\r\nbooks and manuscripts which have been hauled away to Kuba-Altai, one\r\nof the old palaces in the Seraglio, where they have been examined and\r\nclassified by a commission, of which Abdureman Sherif Bey, minister of\r\npublic instruction, is the chairman. Captain Safed Bey, perhaps the\r\nforemost historian in Turkey, was in immediate charge of the work.\r\n\r\nThe sultan’s collection contains many manuscripts in the oriental\r\nlanguages, which were inherited by him and were received as gifts\r\nduring his reign; and many printed volumes of great value for their\r\nbindings and illustrations are in English, French, and German, and\r\nwere presented to him by people who were seeking favours and supposed\r\nthat he had a taste for such things. But Mahmoud Bey says that he\r\nreally did not care particularly for books. He was no student; he\r\nnever read anything and was actually illiterate. His early education\r\nwas neglected, like that of the present sultan, who has no culture or\r\ninclination to acquire it. Mehmed V is fond of show and ceremony, but\r\nit is probable that he never read anything more serious than a French\r\nnovel in his life. Abdul Hamid was a miser in everything. He accepted\r\nall gifts that came his way and seized everything he could reach,\r\nsimply for the pleasure of possession. He was crazy to add to his\r\nwealth, but did not care much what he acquired.\r\n\r\nHence his books are a motley collection of good, bad, and indifferent\r\nworks in manuscripts and printed in all languages, but there is very\r\nlittle to interest scholars, so far as they have been examined. They\r\nwere never classified nor catalogued, but were carefully kept. Sixteen\r\nlibrarians were employed during the latter days of Abdul Hamid, and\r\nthey had several servants who dusted the books regularly and kept them\r\nclean, but the librarians were neither competent nor inclined to make a\r\ncatalogue.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable items in the collection are ornamental copies of\r\nthe Koran and ancient classical poems in Persian and other oriental\r\nlanguages. Many of them are of script of the greatest beauty. They were\r\nmade when penmanship was an art. Painting is prohibited by the Koran,\r\nand for that reason, Moslems turn to penmanship and the illumination of\r\nmanuscripts to exercise their taste. There are also many Turkish and\r\nArabic works of historical value, but thus far no Hebrew, Greek, or\r\nLatin volumes of interest have been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe acquisitive disposition of Abdul Hamid is manifested in a curious\r\nway by some of the books that were found on his shelves. Catalogues\r\nof American manufacturers, price lists, descriptions of battleships\r\nand torpedo boats, and every kind of commercial advertising was mixed\r\nup with his French novels, illustrated manuscripts of the Koran,\r\nilluminated copies of Persian poems and Turkish classics. One of the\r\nmost elaborate volumes in the collection is a description of the\r\nexposition held at the Crystal Palace in London sixty years ago. His\r\nmajesty was very well supplied with similar literature. He had the\r\nofficial reports of almost every exposition that has since been held,\r\nincluding that of the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago, which\r\nhas additional value for the reason that it is a presentation copy from\r\nHakki Bey, the present grand vizier and one of the leaders of the Young\r\nTurk party, which shoved him off his throne.\r\n\r\nThe number of books about Turkey in all the European languages, and\r\nmost of them presented “with the compliments of the author,” is\r\nsurprising. The sultan never bought a book, and never read one, and\r\nwhether these descriptions of his empire were sent him because they\r\nspoke favourably of his reign or the contrary can only be determined by\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nOpening into the library was a sort of storeroom filled with Abdul\r\nHamid’s clothing, new and old, mixed with sheets and towels and other\r\nsoiled linen. Why these things should have been there, a long way from\r\nhis living apartments, has never been explained. In another room was a\r\nstuffed horse and several stuffed dogs, cats, and pigeons, all of them\r\npets of his majesty, which he had preserved in that way.\r\n\r\nThe library of St. Sophia, which was founded nearly a thousand years\r\nago, consists of only about two thousand volumes, all manuscripts,\r\nwithout one single printed book, which are piled up like merchandise\r\nupon shelves protected by woven wire doors, in a small room adjoining\r\nthat mosque. The walls are covered with beautiful Persian tiles and the\r\nroof is a low enamelled dome. The windows are small and narrow and are\r\nprotected by heavy bars. Only since the constitution was proclaimed and\r\nthe new government came into power have strangers been allowed to enter\r\nthis library, and its existence was practically unknown to the public\r\nuntil recently. There is no catalogue; the books have lain undisturbed\r\nfor centuries, and even now nobody knows exactly what they are.\r\n\r\nA quaint old patriarch with a long white beard and keen black eyes that\r\nshoot out rays from under heavy black eyebrows is in charge. He told\r\nme he had been connected with the mosque of St. Sophia for fifty years\r\nand had been in charge of the books for more than thirty years, but was\r\nunable to read one of them. He was very much more disposed to discuss\r\ntheology and politics than to tell me about the books, and I learned by\r\nclose questioning that he was quite as ignorant on that subject as the\r\nrest of the mullahs about the mosque. He was so garrulous that it was\r\ndifficult to stop him long enough for Michel Naskidoff, my interpreter,\r\nto tell me what he was talking about.\r\n\r\nHis name is Selim Abdullah; he was born and brought up in\r\nConstantinople, and was never outside of this city in his life. He gave\r\nus a few other facts in his biography and to make sure that we did not\r\nreport him unfavourably to the minister of education, who gave us a\r\npermit to visit the library, he explained that he had always been in\r\nfavour of constitutional government and had never been a fanatic in\r\nreligion, but until recently people in Turkey had not been allowed to\r\nsay what was in their minds.\r\n\r\nHere we stopped him long enough to examine what he said were the rarest\r\nbooks in the collection. They are kept in a wonderful old chest which\r\nis modelled after a mosque and heavily veneered with mother of pearl.\r\nThat chest would be a prize in any museum, and the old man told me that\r\nit was more than 2,000 years old. Nine of the most precious volumes are\r\nkept there under lock and key, and he brought them all out for us. He\r\ntold us that they are worth more than 20,000 piasters each and were\r\nwritten more than 3,000 years ago. They are the original manuscript,\r\nin the handwriting of the authors in the classical language which was\r\nspoken by the early Turks in Turkestan. No one could read that language\r\nnow, he said, in Turkey at least, although certain famous scholars in\r\nKhiva are familiar with the text.\r\n\r\nHe showed us, among others, an exquisite specimen of penmanship bound\r\nin gold covers, about ten by fourteen inches in size, which he said\r\nwas an ancient Tartar poem, called “Divan,” written in the year 911,\r\nby Hussein Biscara, one of the most famous of all Tartar poets. This\r\nvolume was presented to one of the sultans of Turkey about 600 years\r\nago by one of the shahs of Persia. The text is the most ornate Persian\r\nscript, and each page is illuminated with a border about two inches\r\nwide, of geometric designs worked out in mosaic, with gold leaf and\r\nbright coloured paper. The colours are as brilliant as they were when\r\nthe book was written, and the mosaic was made by cutting the coloured\r\npaper and gold leaf into little bits and pasting them on according to\r\na design. The volume contains fifty-two leaves and 104 pages, also\r\nilluminated with a title page that is a mass of colour. The binding is\r\nnot particularly artistic, but is very rich and costly.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman explained that no one in Constantinople could read\r\nthe book, but in Khiva there were plenty of scholars who could do so.\r\nWhen we told him we had recently returned from a visit to Turkestan, he\r\ninquired eagerly what the Russians were doing up there and whether they\r\nwere persecuting the Mohammedans. He said the Russians are the worst\r\npeople in the world to persecute believers in other religions and are\r\ntrying to force the Mohammedans and Jews to accept the orthodox Greek\r\nfaith. Large numbers of Jews have done so to avoid persecution and to\r\npreserve their property, but no Mohammedan, under any circumstances,\r\nhad ever renounced his belief in the prophet. The only nations who do\r\nnot persecute the Mohammedans, the old man said, are the English and\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\n“Do the Americans persecute Mohammedans?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I do not know that I ever heard that they did,” he replied, “but the\r\nAmericans are just the same as the English, and most of them live in\r\nEngland, because they can make more money there. All the Americans want\r\nis money. They don’t care for art, or science, or religion. I have\r\nheard that they dig up the bones of their ancestors from the cemeteries\r\nand sell them to the farmers for fertilizers, they are so greedy to get\r\nmoney, but I never saw any of them do it. I never saw an American to\r\nknow him, but I suppose they look like other people.”\r\n\r\nWe assured him that we were Americans and that he had been misinformed\r\nabout their persecuting Mohammedans. I asked him if he knew how much\r\nAmerican money had been expended to educate Mohammedans and to give\r\nthem hospitals, and how much had been devoted to the relief of people\r\nof the Turkish Empire who had suffered in droughts and epidemics and\r\nmassacres. He confessed that he did not know; he was not aware that\r\nthe Americans had ever contributed any money for such purposes, and\r\nadmitted, reluctantly, that he did not read the newspapers, for the\r\nreason that he did not consider them reliable. He had known so many\r\ncases where people had been deceived by newspaper publications, and he\r\nhad never read anything about American contributions for the benefit\r\nof Turkey. I told him about the recent Kennedy legacy of $2,500,000\r\nto Robert College and of the Red Cross fund that had been sent to the\r\nrelief of sufferers by massacre, by flood, and by epidemics. He had\r\nnever heard anything of the kind. He never had anything to do with\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\n“We are not Christians,” he said, “because we cannot understand how\r\nthey can have two or three Gods (referring to the doctrine of the\r\ntrinity). Such a thing is impossible. There is but one God. There can\r\nbe no division of spiritual responsibility. It is impossible to believe\r\nthat a man can become a God, and I cannot understand why you Christians\r\nhave three Gods when the first commandment of Moses forbids you to have\r\nmore than one.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t try to explain the doctrine of the trinity to him, because our\r\ntime was short, and endeavoured to get him back to his books. After a\r\nlittle further discussion he showed us two ancient volumes in Sanscrit\r\nscript on parchment which he said were more than three thousand years\r\nold and were also presented to Mahomet the Great by the shah of Persia.\r\n\r\n“Nobody can read these books,” he said, “because the language in which\r\nthey are written has been forgotten by all mankind. It is a language\r\nthat was spoken by millions of people once, but they are all dead and\r\nit has been forgotten.”\r\n\r\nHe showed us a gorgeous volume called “Nargai,” which, he said,\r\ncontained the observations of Mohammed “the champion,” the first\r\nTurkish sultan of that name, whose reign, beginning in 1314, is noted\r\nas the period when a taste for literature and art and a fondness\r\nfor poetry and the drama first prevailed among the Osmanlis. Each\r\nparchment leaf is stained a different tint, including various shades\r\nof the primary colours, and they are ornamented with gold tracery in\r\nthe corners and at the tops and bottoms of the pages. On many pages are\r\nbroad borders of exquisite design and workmanship.\r\n\r\nAnother beautiful volume in Persian script on parchment about fourteen\r\ninches square, the old gentleman said, is the third book ever written\r\nabout the stars. The author was a very learned Egyptian who lived about\r\nthree thousand years ago. The name was on the title page, but he could\r\nnot read it--nevertheless, he was certain that there had never been any\r\nsuch book on astronomy written since that time. It contained everything\r\nthat was ever known about the stars, and all other astronomies could\r\nbe destroyed without doing any damage so long as this one existed. The\r\ncovers are exquisite pieces of leather enamel inlaid with pearl, and\r\nthe work is as fine as that of a watchmaker.\r\n\r\nAll of the 2,000 books in the collection, he said, had been written by\r\nhand. He does not believe much in printed books, because they are full\r\nof mistakes and wear out in a very short time, while manuscripts are\r\nmore accurate and parchment lasts much longer than paper. Many of the\r\nbooks in the collection had belonged to Moorish princes in Spain and\r\nwere taken from them at the time of their expulsion from the peninsula.\r\n“The most learned men in the world are Persians. There are very few\r\nscholars in Europe,” he said, and the wisest of them had studied in\r\nthis library, which he declared was founded by the Sultan Mahmoud, who\r\nreigned from 1142 to 1158.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable volume he showed us was a heavy folio, perhaps 15\r\nby 20 inches in size, of the thickest kind of parchment, covered with\r\nbeautiful script. It is a work of world-wide fame, but doubtless there\r\nare few such beautiful copies. It is known in the medical world as\r\nthe “Avicenna,” and is a treatise on botany and medicine by a famous\r\nphysician and philosopher and the most learned man of his time.\r\n\r\nThe librarian insisted that it was the most important book on medicine\r\never written and that medical men from every part of the world came to\r\nConstantinople to consult it. “It tells,” he said, “about every kind of\r\ndisease that afflicts human beings, and about every plant that grows,\r\nand what diseases each plant will cure.” There is no finer specimen of\r\npenmanship in the world than this volume, and although he was certainly\r\nmistaken when he said that it was written by the hand of Dr. Avicenna\r\nhimself, he did not wander very far from the truth in his assertions\r\nconcerning the value and importance of the treatise. Although many of\r\nits theories have long since been exploded, and human knowledge on the\r\nsubjects of which it treats has been expanded, it is undoubtedly the\r\nmost famous and remarkable medical work that was ever written, and is\r\nwell known to every educated physician.\r\n\r\nThe author, whose name was Abu Ali el Hosein, was born in Bokhara,\r\nabout the year 980 A.D., of a Persian father and a Bokhara mother.\r\nHe was educated among the great scholars who at that period made\r\nBokhara famous as a centre of learning. At a very early age he had\r\nmastered mathematics, logic, theology, and medicine. Before he was\r\nsixteen he was familiar with all the medical theories of that time,\r\nand by gratuitous attendance upon the sick had discovered new methods\r\nof treatment. He developed remarkable genius in botanizing and in\r\nextracting the medicinal properties from plants, in which he was\r\nassisted, according to the popular idea, by supernatural agencies. When\r\nhe was seventeen years old he was famous throughout the khanate of\r\nBokhara, and was appointed official physician to the emir, who owed him\r\nhis recovery from a dangerous illness. This appointment gave Avicenna,\r\nas he was known, leisure to study, means to purchase books that he\r\nrequired, and access to a library which was filled with important\r\nmanuscripts on scientific and other subjects.\r\n\r\nWhen he was twenty-two years old, Avicenna left Bokhara and proceeded\r\nwestward to Merv, Khiva, and other centres of learning, where he\r\nremained for a few years, and then went over into Persia, where he\r\nsettled at Rai, the birthplace of Zoroaster, in the vicinity of\r\nmodern Teheran. There Avicenna remained the greater part of his life,\r\nprosecuting his studies, teaching medicine, and writing books. He\r\nreceived generous support from the emir, although at times he was\r\nsubject to persecution and various annoyances. The last twelve years of\r\nhis life were spent as physician and scientific adviser to the emir of\r\nIspaha.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Avicenna, like many other wise and great men, did not\r\npractise what he preached, but at intervals indulged in excessive\r\nsensual pleasures and dissipation, which ruined his health, and he\r\ndied in June, 1037, at the age of fifty-eight, at the city of Hamaden,\r\nPersia, and was buried among the palm trees in the park that surrounds\r\nthe palace.\r\n\r\nHe wrote more than one hundred treatises. Some of them are pamphlets of\r\na few pages; others extend through several volumes, and they covered\r\nthe entire range of scientific and intellectual activity at that age\r\nof the world, from astronomy to zoölogy. His greatest work, entitled\r\n“The Canons of Medicine,” that which was shown me by the librarian at\r\nSt. Sophia, for six centuries was the highest authority upon medical\r\nsubjects throughout the civilized world. Up to the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century it was used as a text book in most of the European\r\nuniversities, and even now lecturers in the most famous medical schools\r\nfrequently refer to the discoveries and theories of Avicenna with\r\nprofound respect.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages manuscript copies of this book were sought for the\r\nlibraries of kings as well as scientists, and no library was complete\r\nwithout his works on metaphysics, mathematics, alchemy, logic, botany,\r\nand philosophy. Avicenna ranks among Moslem scholars as Aristotle or\r\nPlato ranks among the Greeks. For six hundred years he was entitled to\r\nhis surname of “Prince of Physicians.” In the mediæval world he ranked\r\nequally high as a philosopher and astronomer. His writings have been\r\ndiscussed and elucidated by hundreds of commentators in every one of\r\nthe civilized nations.\r\n\r\nAnd so he continued to discuss his treasures, as fast as his tongue\r\ncould waggle, and he would not let us go without explaining his\r\nviews on the doctrine of the atonement as taught by the Christian\r\nmissionaries in Turkey. He did not know whether Christian theologians\r\nin other parts of the world were guilty of the same folly, but\r\nthe American missionaries in Turkey were teaching the people that\r\nthey could be saved and go to heaven, no matter how many sins they\r\ncommitted, provided they repented of those sins before they died.\r\n“This,” the old gentleman declared, “is such a pernicious doctrine that\r\nI am surprised that the government does not prohibit the missionaries\r\nfrom teaching it. Anyone must see what it would lead to; for if this\r\nmissionary theory is correct, it simply offers an inducement for men to\r\nsin. And then, when they get old, and do not care to sin any more, it\r\nis only necessary for them to say that they are sorry and they will be\r\nforgiven and taken back into the fold and have just as high a place in\r\nheaven as those who have been good and pious all their lives.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE EMANCIPATION OF TURKISH WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of Turkish women is not complete, but has advanced\r\nwith remarkable speed. The restrictions which have kept them in\r\nseclusion and ignorance have already been very largely removed. No\r\nsingle reform that has followed the change of government has been more\r\nradical or complete. Upon the retail trading streets of Pera, the\r\nforeign section of Constantinople, you can see thousands of unveiled\r\nTurkish women any afternoon and thousands more of women whose veils are\r\nthrust aside so that their physical and mental visions are clear, and\r\nthey can look a man in the face without a blush of embarrassment or\r\nshame. In Stamboul, which is almost exclusively of native inhabitants,\r\nthe innovation is not so general, but a stranger would scarcely notice\r\nthe difference. In other Turkish cities the same change has taken\r\nplace. Half the women of the empire wear veils now simply as a matter\r\nof habit instead of preference. The majority of them wear the thinnest\r\nsort of gauze in place of the impenetrable yashmak that they were\r\ncompelled to draw over their faces before the constitution. Indeed, the\r\naverage veil worn by the women of Turkey to-day does not conceal their\r\neyes or their features any more than the dotted stuff affected by the\r\nfashionable women of the European cities and the United States.\r\n\r\nThis gossamer stuff is also in the nature of a compromise, rather than\r\na mask. During the first weeks that followed the revolution of July,\r\n1908, nearly every woman drew off her veil and many participated in the\r\npolitical demonstrations, as the women of Paris did in the riots of the\r\ncommune. And I was told that throughout the day and the evening the\r\nwindows of the residences were filled with unveiled faces, which looked\r\nwithout embarrassment upon the people who were passing by. To-day\r\nwomen who drive about in carriages discard the veil altogether; even\r\nthe inmates of the imperial harem, which, however, is not so radical\r\na change as would appear, because the new sultan is perhaps the most\r\nliberal man in all Turkey. So many Turkish women were imprudent in\r\ntheir behaviour immediately after the revolution that the thoughtful\r\nones called a halt and resumed their veils as a protest against the\r\nindelicate and unwomanly demeanour of some of their sex. The minister\r\nof police issued an official communication, with the approval of the\r\nleaders of the Young Turk party, requesting women not to go into the\r\nstreets with their faces uncovered, and the managers of theatres were\r\nforbidden to admit women to their performances. But such things usually\r\nadjust themselves in time, and the experience of two years has resulted\r\nin a sort of compromise, by which sensible women still wear veils, but\r\ncover their faces only when necessary to protect themselves against\r\nmasculine insolence.\r\n\r\nThe use of the veil for centuries has been more or less an act of\r\npiety, as well as a social custom. It is supposed to be required by the\r\nKoran. I have never been able to find any passage which demands or even\r\nsuggests it, but that is the interpretation of the Mohammedan world,\r\nand the association of ideas has made the veil a badge of feminine\r\nvirtue. An ordinary Mohammedan woman would no more go into the street,\r\nor stand in the presence of a man who does not belong to her family,\r\nwithout a veil than she would without a skirt or any other necessary\r\narticle of clothing.\r\n\r\nThis practice prevails throughout the Mohammedan world, but in the\r\nlarger cities, where the women of the foreign population have been\r\naccustomed to go about with uncovered faces as they do at home, the\r\nveil has come to be regarded as a badge of slavery, and women of\r\nintelligence and self-respect have detested it as they would shackles\r\nupon their hands or feet. This explains why so many Turkish women cast\r\noff their veils and went about the streets with uncovered faces at\r\nthe first opportunity that was offered them. But the thoughtful ones\r\nhave settled down to a rational estimate of their condition and have\r\ntaken their fate in their own hands. They have decided upon their own\r\nemancipation, but their leaders are wise enough to urge the necessity\r\nof caution and to beg their sisters to avoid every form of imprudence,\r\nlest too radical and rapid a reform should create a reaction.\r\n\r\nThe change, however, has been a long time coming. It is by no means\r\nthe consequence of constitutional government, although the revolution\r\nfurnished the opportunity. For many years the traditional Turkish\r\nharem has been breaking up. One of the principal causes has been the\r\nextravagance of the women and their love of fine raiment. None but a\r\nvery rich man could afford more than one wife. The French dressmakers\r\nand milliners, who occupy a large space in Constantinople, invaded the\r\nharems with samples and models many years ago, and are entitled to\r\nthe credit of being the pioneers of the emancipation of Turkish women.\r\nEnglish and German and French governesses have also played a very\r\nimportant part in preparing the minds of their pupils and inspiring\r\nthem with ideas and ambitions which were incompatible with the harem.\r\nFrench novels have had an equal influence.\r\n\r\nAll this has been realized, and the events that have occurred have been\r\nfeared. In 1901 Abdul Hamid ordered all Turkish families to dismiss\r\ntheir European governesses and instructed the police to prohibit\r\nTurkish ladies from visiting European milliners and dressmakers. He\r\nforbade the importation of European books. He summoned a council\r\nof Mohammedan bishops to prescribe the colour of the garments, the\r\nthickness of the veils, and the shape of the shoes that the women of\r\nTurkey should wear, but he was as helpless as Canute, the old Viking,\r\nwho only tried to brush back the tide with his broom. The only effect\r\nof the sultan’s efforts to preserve the morals of his subjects was to\r\nstrengthen their determination to have their own way. I have heard\r\nthat it is folly to oppose a woman when her mind is made up, and\r\nperhaps Abdul Hamid realizes that he defeated his own purpose by his\r\ninterference with the fashions of the day. No evidence is needed to\r\ndemonstrate that fact. He is a prisoner for life in a gloomy villa near\r\nSalonika, while the women of Turkey are shopping without their veils.\r\n\r\nThe most important and the most gratifying sign of the times is the\r\neagerness of the young women of Turkey for education. The use of the\r\nveil is a matter of the greatest insignificance in comparison with\r\nthe new spirit that is apparent everywhere among the families of the\r\nhigher and middle classes. Many Turkish women have acquired the French\r\nlanguage. A few speak English and German, which they have learned\r\nfrom their governesses, but they are very few who have a knowledge of\r\nbooks. But now every woman wants to know and she is seeking in every\r\ndirection for instruction that will aid her in performing her duty to\r\nher husband, her family, and herself.\r\n\r\nIn an article in the _National Magazine_ of London, in the summer\r\nof 1910, Sir Edwin Pears, correspondent of the London _Times_ in\r\nConstantinople for forty years, who knows Turkey better than any Turk,\r\ngave a very interesting review of this situation, and, among other\r\nthings, said:\r\n\r\n“There is now being held at the great American College for Girls at\r\nScutari a weekly class of about eighty Turkish women who are studying\r\npreventive medicine, the proper sanitary regulations for a household,\r\nthe management of children, and similar subjects of primary importance\r\nto the sex. The lecturers are medical men, for the hekim, or doctor,\r\nis privileged, and Turkish women may attend his lectures, while\r\nconventionality would prevent their being present at lectures given by\r\nany other man. I may mention here that no one has done more for the\r\neducation of the women of Turkey than Dr. Mary Patrick, the principal\r\nof Scutari College. She is an enthusiastic teacher whose influence upon\r\nhundreds of girls has been of incalculable value.”\r\n\r\nSir William Ramsey, the eminent Scottish scientist, in a book published\r\nby him concerning Turkey in 1910, said:\r\n\r\n“Robert College is one of the most remarkable creations of pure,\r\nunselfish beneficence, guided by admirable common sense, that the\r\nhistory of the world has known. It has been for more than fifty years\r\nmaking an educated middle class among the Christians of southeastern\r\nEurope and of Asia Minor. And many people who know the country well\r\nbelieve that it has done more to render possible a peaceful solution of\r\nthe Eastern question than all the European powers and ambassadors. * *\r\n* The sole aim of the American missions and of Robert College has been\r\nto create self-respect and life in the people of this country.\r\n\r\n“The American College for Women at Scutari, which is soon going to\r\nmigrate to new quarters on the European side of the Bosphorus, aims at\r\ndoing for the women of the various races of Turkey what Robert College\r\nhas been doing for the men. It was started as a high school in 1871, it\r\nwas chartered in 1890 as a college by the legislature of Massachusetts,\r\nand it has also an imperial Turkish irade. The language is English and\r\nthe life is English or American, which in this case are equivalent; but\r\nthe native languages of the students are also taught, and (if desired)\r\nthe languages which are to them classical, ancient Greek, Latin,\r\nPersian, and Arabic.\r\n\r\n“Hitherto,” Sir William Ramsey continues, “Turkish girls could only be\r\neducated at the college in defiance of the will and the commands of\r\nthe sultan, and therefore the number of such pupils has been small.\r\nOnly two Mohammedan girls have graduated. But the different races in\r\nTurkey live side and side, and what is taking place in one community\r\nis not hidden from the other--especially such important facts as the\r\nsending away to school or college of the daughters of any family,\r\nand the inevitable, although gradual, changes in the ideas and life\r\nof the people that result from education. Many instances could be\r\ncited of the imitation by Turks of new habits thus introduced among\r\ntheir Armenian neighbours by the daughters returned from this college\r\nor educated at the American missionary schools and colleges in the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nSir William Ramsey continues to say: “The writer Halideh Salih\r\nis a graduate of the American College for Girls, and a writer of\r\ndistinction. She has frequently been described as the leading woman\r\nin Turkey in popularity and influence. Her first published work was\r\na translation into Turkish of an English book, ‘The Mother in the\r\nHome,’ for which she was decorated by the sultan. It always struck\r\nme as remarkable that a Mohammedan sultan--and that sultan Abdul\r\nHamid--should be the first monarch to bestow such a distinction upon a\r\nwoman.”\r\n\r\nHalideh Salih is undoubtedly the foremost woman in Turkey. Her father\r\nwas formerly minister of finance for many years under Abdul Hamid and\r\nsacrificed his political position and prospects by sending his daughter\r\nto the American College for Girls, because such an act was forbidden\r\nby the sultan. She spent seven years under Dr. Patrick’s instruction,\r\ngraduated in 1901, and married a professor in the Imperial University.\r\n“The Mother in the Home” is an old-fashioned book for girls written by\r\nRev. Jacob Abbott seventy-five or eighty years ago, and she translated\r\nit into Turkish when she was a freshman in the American college.\r\nHer father was so proud of it that he had it printed and circulated\r\nprivately among the families of his friends in Constantinople and other\r\nTurkish cities, and, considering its limited circulation, there is\r\nnot the slightest doubt that this little volume of fatherly advice to\r\ngirls, written by a modest Massachusetts village clergyman, had as\r\nmuch influence in the emancipation of Turkish women as “Uncle Tom’s\r\nCabin” had in the emancipation of the slaves. When the constitution was\r\nproclaimed Halideh Salih wrote the leading editorials in the _Tanin_\r\nnewspaper, the organ of the committee of union and progress, at the\r\nrequest of the editor, defining the policy and the purposes of the\r\nrevolution. Her articles became the platform of the liberal party in\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nShe has written a great deal for the _Tanin_ since, and for the London\r\npapers and magazines. She has a novel dealing with recent events in\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nDr. Patrick bought fifty acres of land upon a bluff 400 feet above\r\nthe Bosphorus, behind the village of Arnaoutkeny, six miles from\r\nConstantinople. It is the ancient seat of a pasha, and more than a\r\ncentury ago was purchased by a rich Armenian, who laid out the grounds\r\nin luxurious style. It has been occupied by his descendants for several\r\ngenerations. During the last five or six years it has been leased by\r\nthe consul general of Great Britain. The sultan tried to purchase it\r\nas a wedding present for one of his daughters, and when he found that\r\nDr. Patrick had an option upon the property, instructed his minister\r\nat Washington to request President Roosevelt to persuade her to give\r\nit up, but she declined to do so, and fought him off until he was\r\noverthrown and then she closed the trade.\r\n\r\nA large part of the property is in forest, venerable old trees as\r\ndark as a druid temple; and a winding road leads from a landing\r\non the Bosphorus to the mansion at the top of the bluff, 400 feet\r\nabove the water, through a ravine. The mansion is in the midst of an\r\nold-fashioned garden surrounded by several immense cedars of Lebanon,\r\nsaid to be the finest in Turkey. Back of the mansion is a terrace\r\n1,500 feet long and about one thousand feet wide, where the buildings\r\nwill be laid out in a quadrangle. They will all be of the same school\r\nof architecture--free Italian renaissance and the material will be\r\nstone quarried on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe central building, to be called Gould Hall, will be 176 by 80\r\nfeet in size, with four stories and a basement. It will contain\r\nan auditorium, to be used as a temporary chapel and for literary\r\nexercises, that will accommodate 700 people, a central parlour or\r\nrendezvous for the students, 40 by 45 feet; several lecture rooms; a\r\ntemporary art gallery; the offices of the administration, and several\r\nstudy rooms. It is hoped that some one will soon give funds for a\r\nchapel, a library, and a refectory, as plans have already been drawn\r\nfor these buildings as a part of the general group. Space will be left\r\nfor them, but Dr. Patrick is confident that it will not remain vacant\r\nlong. The great necessity is to get dormitories where the girls can\r\nsleep and rooms where they can study and recite, in order to relieve\r\nthe pressure from those who are earnestly seeking an education.\r\nThe rooms in Gould Hall will suffice for administration, worship,\r\nexhibitions, and library until the greater necessities are provided for.\r\n\r\nThe second building, known as Science Hall, will be connected with\r\nGould Hall by an arcade to shelter the students in stormy weather. It\r\nwill be a memorial to the late Henry Woods, a Boston merchant, and is\r\nbeing erected by his widow. The dimensions will be 150 feet and it will\r\nbe of similar design and the same material as Gould Hall. The interior\r\nwill be arranged for lecture rooms and laboratories for biology,\r\nphysics, and chemistry and will be used as a dining hall for the time\r\nbeing, and one of the laboratories as a kitchen until a permanent\r\nrefectory is provided.\r\n\r\nThe next building, of similar design and materials, will be called\r\nRockefeller Hall and will contain sleeping accommodations for 150\r\nstudents, two in a room. The ground plan is 114 by 50 feet, with\r\ntwo wings extending in the rear, 50 by 35 feet, and it will be four\r\nstories in height. There will be two more dormitories, each capable of\r\naccommodating 150 students--a total of 450 boarders, in place of the\r\n190 that were accommodated at the last term.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-first annual commencement of the Mektep Ammerrycolly\r\nKuzlaran, or the American College for Girls, at Constantinople in June,\r\n1910, was a momentous occasion in many respects and especially because\r\nthe women of Turkey have been so far released from the restrictions\r\nthat have surrounded them that they are now free to seek an education\r\nlike men and are taking an active and influential part in public\r\naffairs. The commencement was also of unprecedented interest because it\r\nis probably the last celebration of the kind that will ever take place\r\nin the old buildings in Scutari, a suburb of Constantinople on the\r\nAsiatic shore of the Bosphorus, where the school was started a quarter\r\nof a century ago, and where so many good women have been educated to\r\nmould public opinion in the households throughout the Turkish Empire\r\nand the neighbouring states. Before another year is passed the college\r\nwill be at least partially occupying splendid new buildings, located\r\non a beautiful site on the European side of the Bosphorus, where the\r\nwork of construction has already been begun and is rapidly progressing.\r\nAlready the preparatory department has been removed to the European\r\nside. With the change the college not only gains the advantages of\r\ngreater room and larger conveniences, but greater dignity and prestige,\r\npride of purpose, and ambition of achievement, which are the best\r\ninspirations that a man or woman of an institution of learning can\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nDr. Mary Mills Patrick, the president of the college, to whose ability\r\nand energy and tact its success and influence is largely due, had just\r\nreturned from a year’s visit to the United States, where she had been\r\nsuccessful in raising funds for the purchase of new grounds and the\r\nerection of new buildings which will enable the college to extend its\r\ninfluence and usefulness. No one can realize so fully as that noble\r\nwoman the importance of the results she accomplished for the good of\r\nthe women of Turkey and the welfare of the Turkish race.\r\n\r\nDr. Patrick raised $350,000 while she was in the United States. Miss\r\nHelen Gould gave $150,000 for a new building to be called Gould Hall,\r\nand $25,000 for general purposes, John D. Rockefeller gave $150,000 for\r\na new building, Mrs. Henry Woods of Boston $50,000, Mrs. Russell Sage\r\ngave $15,000 for land and $5,000 for a wall to be built around it, the\r\nlate John H. Converse gave $10,000, Miss Grace Dodge gave $10,000 for\r\nthe purchase of the land. Mrs. D. Willis James, Mrs. Henry F. Durant,\r\nMrs. John Hay, James Talcott, D. Stuart Dodge and other friends made\r\ngenerous contributions toward the purchase of the land, the erection of\r\nnew buildings, and the general fund.\r\n\r\nThe Mektep Ammerrycolly Kuzlaran, as the American College for Girls is\r\ncalled by the Turks, is now at high tide. It not only possesses the\r\nmost beautiful site on the banks of the Bosphorus, considered by many\r\nthe most beautiful sheet of water in the world, but will have a group\r\nof buildings equal to any in the United States. It has been officially\r\nrecognized by the Turkish government and commended by the minister of\r\neducation as a model for Turkish educational institutions to imitate.\r\nMahmoud Bey, inspector general of education, told me several times\r\nthat he considered it an ideal school. He said it “had set the pace\r\nand furnished the standard for colleges for women in the East. No\r\ninstitution for women in Europe has a higher standard and its graduates\r\nare recognized as among the most influential women in Turkey.”\r\n\r\nThe minister of finance delivered the address to the graduating class\r\nand the American ambassador presided. A Mohammedan government is\r\nofficially contracting for the education of Mohammedan girls in a\r\nChristian school to be qualified as teachers of Mohammedan children.\r\nThis is perhaps the most extraordinary event that has taken place in\r\nthe educational world for many years and indicates the radical changes\r\nthat have taken place in the Ottoman empire.\r\n\r\nA great boom in the education of women is about to begin in Turkey.\r\nThe American College for Girls has been the source of inspiration and\r\nthe ideal. Everybody agrees that the most remarkable change in social\r\nconditions caused by the revolution in Turkey has occurred among\r\nthe feminine portion of the population, and it is conceded that the\r\nwives and mothers of the Young Turk party had a powerful influence\r\nin bringing it about. During the anxious months of conspiracy and\r\npreparation many high-born Turkish ladies worked with enthusiasm\r\nand intelligence for the cause of liberty. Some of them acted as\r\nmessengers, carrying concealed about their persons papers which,\r\nif discovered, would have meant their death; others afforded the\r\nrevolutionary committees opportunities for holding their meetings and\r\nfurnished those who were in danger means of escape. Twelve thousand\r\nspies in the employ of Abdul Hamid were unable to outwit the women of\r\nTurkey in their work, and the leaders of the Young Turk party concede\r\nthat they owe their success largely to the assistance of their wives\r\nand sisters and mothers.\r\n\r\nIt was not the work of a day, however, or a year, but of a generation,\r\nand in the preparation of the women of Turkey for the performance of\r\nthis patriotic duty the American College for Girls at Scutari has been\r\none of the most effective agencies. Its president, its faculty, and its\r\nalumnæ have been engaged for a quarter of a century in a far-reaching\r\npropaganda to convince the women of Turkey that they are entitled to\r\nlight and learning, and the results are seen in the eagerness with\r\nwhich the daughters of the foremost families of the empire are seeking\r\nan education similar to that which English and American girls receive.\r\n\r\nIt is purely an American institution which began in a small way\r\ntwenty-five years ago, and for all those years has offered the only\r\nopportunity for a higher education within the reach of the young women\r\nof the East. Among the faculty are graduates of Cornell, Wellesley,\r\nBarnard, Middlebury, and Smith colleges, and six of the alumnæ of the\r\ninstitution are on the corps of instructors.\r\n\r\n“You ask if there has been any difference in the conduct of our\r\nstudents since the constitution,” said Dr. Patrick in reply to my\r\nquestion. “I have noticed a much greater largeness of ideas and a much\r\nwider scope of ambition since the adoption of the constitution has\r\nopened new opportunities to them. The change is wholly favourable.\r\nThe new government is decidedly in favour of the education of women,\r\nwhile Abdul Hamid was stubbornly opposed. It is favourably disposed to\r\nthe American College for Women. Djavid Bey, the minister of finance,\r\ndelivered our commencement address. Nedjneddin Bey, minister of justice\r\nin the cabinet, sends his daughter to us, and we have five students\r\nwhose tuition is paid by the government. We have just received an\r\napplication from the government to buy our property in Scutari when\r\nthe college moves to its new site, in order that a school for Turkish\r\nwomen may be continued in the place where one has existed for so long.\r\nThis could not have occurred before the constitution, and is sufficient\r\nof itself to convince any one of the feeling of the Turkish government\r\ntoward our work.\r\n\r\n“Several of our graduates are the wives of men who have been active\r\nin the development of Bulgaria, members of the cabinet and members of\r\nparliament, and I do not know how many had an active part in the recent\r\nrevolution in Turkey. At that time we had only two Mohammedans among\r\nour alumnæ. Since then we have added another. Both of these took an\r\nactive part in the recent revolution, consulting with the men leaders,\r\nwho sought their advice and suggestions, writing for the papers, and\r\neven speaking in behalf of the reform. One of our Mohammedan graduates\r\nhas already become a power in political circles of Constantinople. I\r\nrefer to Mme. Halideh Salih, who writes for the newspapers constantly,\r\ndiscussing leading questions with great ability, and her advice is\r\noften asked by the political leaders and the statesmen of Turkey.\r\n\r\n“The principal races represented among the students of the American\r\nCollege for Women are Armenians, Greeks, Bulgarians, and Turks, the\r\nproportion of each being not far from equal. It is a new thing,\r\nhowever, to have so many Turkish girls in our college, and everybody\r\nwill be interested to know that a Turkish girl leads the preparatory\r\nschool in scholarship. She has been in school only one year, but\r\nduring that time has finished all the courses except the last in the\r\npreparatory department.\r\n\r\n“During the last year one fourth of all our resident students were\r\nTurkish girls, although it was their first year of freedom--the first\r\ntime in history that young women of Mohammedan families have felt able\r\nor willing to go openly to Christian schools.\r\n\r\n“Several of our alumnæ have studied for the medical profession and are\r\npractising with success. Until now the conditions in Turkey have not\r\npermitted women to enter into other professions, but that will soon be\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n“The present Turkish government is making praiseworthy efforts in the\r\ndirection of education,” continued Dr. Patrick. “Reforms have been\r\ninstituted in the Turkish University for Men, in the Galata Serai\r\nSchool, and a large normal school for girls organized in Stamboul by\r\nMme. Halideh Salih, to whom I have just referred. She has practically\r\ntaken charge of it. The department of education is now a careful\r\nand conscientious body of officials who have taken in hand the\r\nreorganization of the different schools and are planning an educational\r\nsystem similar to that in other countries.\r\n\r\n“The visits of the parents of the Turkish girls who have come into our\r\nschool this year have been extremely interesting. Invariably they say\r\nthat they have long wished to send their daughters here, and they are\r\ncurious to see how a woman’s college is conducted. They inspect the\r\nhouses and the grounds and express themselves as very much pleased with\r\nwhat they see. The social position of our Turkish students varies from\r\nthat of a cabinet minister’s daughter to the merchant class, but for\r\nthe most part they come from cultured and progressive families. Several\r\nof the girls had a knowledge of English or French when they came to us.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible to put into words the enthusiasm which has been\r\nawakened among the girls since the political change. The Armenians\r\nare especially enthusiastic. You know that under the old sultan it\r\nwas forbidden to speak the name Armenia, but our girls from that\r\nprovince organized a society and gave a concert consisting of Armenian\r\nfolk songs which were formerly forbidden, but since the constitution\r\nhave been brought out of various monasteries or Russian homes where\r\nthey have been hidden. The meetings of the society have been devoted\r\nto the study of Armenian history and literature. Two seniors wrote\r\ntheir theses along the lines of Armenian history, and are talking of\r\nbeginning research work into the remains of ancient Armenia.\r\n\r\n“An enlightened study of history has long been forbidden in Turkey,\r\nalthough a garbled version has been taught in the schools. Now that all\r\nrestrictions are removed it is possible to offer the students a wider\r\nrange of reading and discussion and we have endeavoured to give the\r\nTurkish and Armenian girls such a breadth of knowledge of their own\r\nnational history as they have never been able to enjoy before.\r\n\r\n“The opportunities for people of the lower classes to send their\r\nchildren to school are so meagre and competent teachers in Turkey are\r\nso few that our students realize the tremendous opportunity offered the\r\ngraduates of the American college who are Ottoman subjects to assist\r\nin the education of the people. We have been greatly handicapped in\r\nreceiving Turkish students because they have received no elementary\r\neducation in their own schools and in their own language.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible for those who have not lived in Turkey to realize\r\nwhat the changes mean and what freedom means. During the preceding\r\nyear, for example, we were advised not to have the simple constitution\r\nof an association of our girls put into print, as it would be unsafe\r\nfor them if by accident a printed copy should be discovered. But that\r\nis all changed now and we are practically as free as the schools of any\r\nEuropean country.\r\n\r\n“The whole country, suddenly awakened to the importance of education,\r\nis filled with a desire to study, and young men and women of all\r\nclasses are eagerly demanding a share in the benefits that education\r\ngives. The most serious part of the situation, and a lamentable fact,\r\nis that there are so few Turkish teachers ready or competent to impart\r\ninstruction, and already a plan is on foot to send groups to Europe to\r\nbe trained. Several night schools have been started in the city, where,\r\nin the absence of other instructors, leaders of the Young Turk party\r\nhave themselves undertaken the teaching.\r\n\r\n“The Mohammedan women are no less eager than the men, and they\r\nnaturally turn for help to this college, which for so many years has\r\nbeen the only institution for the higher education of women in all\r\ncountries in the East. We are ready and able to give them the education\r\nthey so eagerly desire, but our quarters are so crowded that it is\r\nimpossible to accept more than a small number of the many applications\r\nfor admission that we receive. In spite of the knowledge of the present\r\novercrowded state of the college many Turkish women are so anxious that\r\ntheir daughters shall share in the new life that is opening to the\r\nwomen of Turkey that they persist in coming to Scutari to beg us to\r\ntake in their daughters. And when they get the inevitable answer that\r\nthere is no room, the girls frequently burst into tears, while their\r\nmothers have difficulty in concealing their disappointment.\r\n\r\n“When we get into the new buildings on the other side of the Bosphorus\r\none of the first steps will be the establishment of a normal school.\r\nEven now, in the limited space at our disposal, we have the nucleus\r\nof a normal school in five Turkish young women sent to us by the\r\ngovernment to be trained for teachers of Mohammedan children. Think of\r\ntraining teachers for Mohammedan schools in a Christian school, and you\r\nwill have a slight suggestion of the extraordinary changes that have\r\ntaken place in Turkey.\r\n\r\n“I am often asked what is the use to educate women for the harem? But\r\nyou must know that the character of the harem has entirely changed\r\nunder the new régime, and the women of the harem are now at liberty to\r\nlearn and to read, and to work, and even to come into contact with the\r\noutside world; to participate in the movements of the day, and even\r\nto influence them. With this liberty and this continual increase of\r\nopportunities it is even more important that the women of the harem\r\nshould be educated than any others.\r\n\r\n“It is true that the Turkish woman is still more restricted than those\r\nof the European countries and the United States, but the day of her\r\ncomplete seclusion has passed forever; the barriers that confined her\r\nfrom contact with the outside world have been removed. She is no longer\r\nignorant; she no longer is kept from a knowledge of what is going on\r\naround her, and she will have no lack of influence in the development\r\nof Turkey in future years.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nROBERT COLLEGE AND OTHER AMERICAN SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forty-seventh scholastic year at Robert College opened in October,\r\n1910, under most favourable and gratifying auspices. Never before were\r\nthe prospects of usefulness so glowing. Through the efforts of Mr.\r\nStraus, the American ambassador, Robert College has been recognized\r\nby the Turkish government and is no longer a mere squatter on Turkish\r\nsoil, without legal rights and simply tolerated. After many years of\r\npatient application and argument an imperial irade has been issued\r\nrecognizing the institution in the fullest sense as entitled to all\r\nthe legal rights and privileges of Turkish institutions of learning,\r\nunder its charter by the State of New York; and, at the same time,\r\ngranting it exemption from the recent “laws of association,” which\r\nrequire all foreign corporations doing business in Turkey to have\r\nTurkish representation in their boards of directors and trustees. The\r\nsame privileges are granted at the same time to the Protestant college\r\nat Beirut, the American College for Girls at Scutari, and to all other\r\nAmerican missionary institutions for higher education throughout the\r\nTurkish Empire. For this recognition these institutions are indebted to\r\nthe persistency and the influence of Mr. Straus, who, during all the\r\nyears that he has served as the diplomatic representative of the United\r\nStates at the Turkish court, has been an active friend and protector of\r\nChristian missionaries and the work in which they are engaged.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this irade the Turkish government has placed in Robert\r\nCollege five more students, making ten in all, to be educated according\r\nto American ideas for teachers and superintendents of schools. Although\r\nRobert College is founded on the Christian faith and its students are\r\nrequired to attend religious worship on Sunday and morning prayer on\r\nweek days, it is entirely non-sectarian and no questions are ever asked\r\nas to the religious belief of students, any more than concerning their\r\npolitical views. They attend worship just as they attend lectures, as\r\na part of the curriculum, be they Jews, or Greeks, or Mohammedans.\r\nBut it is very significant that a Mohammedan government should select\r\na Christian college for the education of Mohammedan youth. Perhaps\r\nit would not do so if there were Mohammedan institutions where these\r\nyoung men could be educated. But the Turkish cabinet shows confidence\r\nin the good faith as well as the capacity of the American missionaries\r\nnot only in this case but in a hundred other similar cases where the\r\ngovernment is paying the expenses of Mohammedan students in missionary\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nRobert College occupies one of the most superb sites of any institution\r\nin the world. It stands on the summit of one of the highest bluffs\r\nof the Bosphorus, commanding a view in both directions and over both\r\nshores of that wonderful body of water. It is a test of limb and lung\r\nto climb the path that leads up the Hill of Science from the boat\r\nlanding at the suburban village of Bebek, but when you reach the top\r\nyou are fully repaid for the exertion by the panorama that is spread\r\nout before you as well as by the cordial welcome of President Gates and\r\nhis associates.\r\n\r\nMohammed II selected this commanding point for the Rumili Hisar, a\r\nmighty castle which he built in the middle of the fifteenth century\r\nwhile he was besieging the city of Constantinople. Immediately\r\nopposite, upon the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus, a similar castle was\r\nerected, and the two commanded the passage so that every ship passing\r\nup and down was compelled to pay toll. Mohammed called this castle\r\nBoghag Kessen (Throat Cutter), for he had a very pleasant way with him.\r\nThe ruins are as picturesque and extensive as any in Europe, and the\r\ntowers are almost perfect after nearly 600 years, although the floors\r\nand ceilings have long since fallen through. The walls have crumbled\r\nand much stone has been taken away for building material. They were\r\noriginally thirty feet thick and thirty feet high and were built with\r\nthe greatest haste and energy. Mohammed employed 1,000 masons, 1,000\r\nlime burners, and 10,000 labourers in the construction, and to each\r\nmason was assigned the task of building two yards of wall in three\r\nmonths. By this division of labour and responsibility the work was\r\ncompleted in the time named by the ingenious designs of the engineers,\r\nand the outline of the walls forms the Turkish word “Mahomet.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robert College, on the Bosphorus]\r\n\r\nCertain incidents in connection with the foundation and early history\r\nof Robert College are quite romantic. During the Crimean war a New\r\nYork merchant, Christopher Robert, was visiting Constantinople,\r\nand while crossing the Bosphorus one day in a boat to Scutari, the\r\nprincipal suburb on the Asiatic side, ran across a boat-load of\r\nbread which looked very much like that he was accustomed to at home.\r\nUpon inquiry he learned that the loaves came from the ovens of an\r\nAmerican missionary school conducted by a man named Hamlin at Bebek,\r\non the opposite side of the strait, and that they were on their way to\r\nhospitals established by Florence Nightingale for the care of the sick\r\nand wounded British soldiers. Mr. Robert, who was a keen Scotsman, was\r\nimpressed with the sagacity of a missionary who would enter into an\r\narrangement like that, and took an early opportunity of visiting the\r\nschool. Dr. Hamlin explained that he obtained the contract to supply\r\nthe British hospitals with bread: first, because he needed the money;\r\nsecond, because they needed the bread, and, third, because he had an\r\nindustrial department in connection with his school and was trying to\r\nteach his students how to earn their living.\r\n\r\nThe missionary baker and the Scottish merchant soon became intimate\r\nfriends, and Dr. Hamlin lost no opportunity to impress upon him the\r\nopportunities for an American college at the capital of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. As a consequence Mr. Robert gave Dr. Hamlin $30,000 to purchase\r\na site and put up a building.\r\n\r\nDr. Hamlin selected the ground on which the college now stands, but the\r\nowner, Ahmed Vefik Pasha, Turkish ambassador to Paris, and a famous\r\nman in his day, declined to sell. So Dr. Hamlin had to go elsewhere,\r\nand examined twenty-two sites. As the best, he selected one above the\r\nvillage of Courouchesmeh, and bought it, but the Turkish notables in\r\nthe vicinity protested against the erection of a Christian college in\r\ntheir neighbourhood, and the ground remained unoccupied until its sale\r\na few years ago. Meantime Ahmed Vefik Pasha was in need of money, owing\r\nto the failure of the government to provide for his heavy expenses in\r\nParis, and he accepted the offer he had refused before. A permit to\r\nbuild was obtained without much difficulty, but no sooner was work\r\nbegun than the police stopped it, strange to say, upon the complaint of\r\nFrance and Russia, whose ambassadors objected to the influence of an\r\nAmerican college on the banks of the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Hamlin was not to be deterred in his purpose and in September,\r\n1863, with three professors and four students, began work in a room\r\nof a large house, now the residence of Mr. Heizer, the American\r\nvice-consul general, which was then used for Christian worship\r\nby members of the English and American colonies, and also by the\r\nmissionaries of the American Board for a theological seminary. The\r\ncollege remained there for eight years while Dr. Hamlin was importuning\r\nthe government for a permit to build on his own ground. He became such\r\na nuisance that Ali Pasha exclaimed one day:\r\n\r\n“Will this man Hamlin ever die and stop bothering me about his\r\neverlasting college?”\r\n\r\nAbout that time the late Edwin D. Morgan of New York visited\r\nConstantinople and became interested in the embryonic institution. Upon\r\nhis return to Washington he told Mr. Seward, then secretary of state,\r\nabout the situation. The latter sent for the Turkish minister and gave\r\nhim some very strong talk. The minister, being impressed with Mr.\r\nSeward’s earnestness, telegraphed the Sublime Porte to give a building\r\npermit to the American college at once, “lest it prove a thorny\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\nThe thorn which he predicted, all unconscious of its own influence or\r\nthe apprehension it created in the mind of the sultan, appeared in the\r\nBosphorus a few weeks later in the form of that grand old man-of-war\r\n_Hartford_, with Admiral Farragut in command. The admiral was making a\r\ncruise around the world, without the slightest political or diplomatic\r\nresponsibility, but the guilty conscience of the sultan needed no\r\naccuser.\r\n\r\nDr. Hamlin’s son Alfred, now a professor in Columbia University, New\r\nYork, was so eager to see an American flagship that he persuaded his\r\nfather very reluctantly to waste the time, as he then believed, to go\r\non board; and, upon paying his respects to the admiral, he explained\r\nwho he was and what he was trying to do in Constantinople, and his\r\ndifficulty about getting a building permit from the Turkish government.\r\nDr. Seropain, an Armenian physician, who understood the situation, was\r\npresent at the interview, and, knowing that the admiral was to dine\r\nwith the grand vizier that evening, suggested that he ask his host the\r\nsimple question:\r\n\r\n“Why do you refuse the American college permission to put up its\r\nbuildings?”\r\n\r\n“Please do not say anything more,” said Dr. Seropain, “and do not make\r\nany comments upon the answer you receive.”\r\n\r\nA few days later an imperial irade was received authorizing the\r\nerection of the necessary buildings for the college. Dr. Hamlin was\r\nalmost paralyzed, but he soon learned that the Turkish government,\r\nputting one thing and another together, imagined that the _Hartford_\r\nhad been sent over to enforce the demands of our government in behalf\r\nof the American college, and accepted the situation before it became\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nThe corner stone of the first building was laid on the Fourth of July,\r\n1869, and on the Fourth of July, 1871, it was formally inaugurated in\r\nan address by William H. Seward, then on his journey around the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert continued to support the institution until his death,\r\nwhen he bequeathed it one fifth of his entire estate, making his\r\nbenefactions altogether nearly a half million dollars. Since his death\r\nthe college has had many generous benefactors, and the late John S.\r\nKennedy, who had given a good deal of money before, left it a legacy of\r\nnearly $2,000,000 in his will.\r\n\r\nThere have been three presidents--Cyrus Hamlin, its founder; George\r\nWashburn, now president-emeritus, who is spending his well-earned\r\nvacation in the United States, and Caleb Frank Gates, D.D., LL.D., who\r\nwas born in Chicago and is a son of the late Caleb F. Gates, a partner\r\nof E. W. Blatchford in the shot tower and lead works on North Side.\r\nDr. Gates graduated at Beloit College in the class of ’77, and from\r\nthe Chicago Theological Seminary in the class of ’81; went to Turkey\r\nas a missionary, where he engaged in educational work and was elected\r\npresident of Euphrates College in 1894. He remained there until 1902,\r\nwhen he took a year’s vacation, and was elected president of Robert\r\nCollege in 1903.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished member of the faculty is Professor Alexander\r\nvan Milligen, a Scotchman from Edinburgh, where he was educated.\r\nHe is perhaps the highest authority in archæology in the Levant,\r\nand has written several books on the Byzantine Empire, Turkey and\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of 1910 at Robert College was of unusual interest\r\nand significance. It not only added another class of twenty-eight\r\nwell-trained young men of ambition to the list of leaders of modern\r\ncivilization in the East, but marked an epoch in the history of one of\r\nthe most useful of all educational institutions. Robert College has\r\nbeen struggling along for half a century with limited resources, but,\r\nby reason of a legacy from the late John S. Kennedy of New York, the\r\ntrustees will be able to increase its educational capacity threefold,\r\nadd eight new chairs to the faculty, extend the campus, and thus\r\nenlarge its usefulness and influence.\r\n\r\n“You will find the graduates of Robert College scattered pretty\r\nthoroughly over Turkey, Armenia, and the Balkan states,” said Dr.\r\nCaleb F. Gates, president of that institution, in reply to my inquiry.\r\n“You will find many physicians, attorneys, teachers, bankers,\r\nmerchants, shipping agents, clerks in the Imperial Ottoman Bank, in\r\nthe post-office service of Turkey, and in the counting-houses of\r\nConstantinople and other cities. Several of our students are merchants\r\nin New York. One of our graduates of the class of ’72, Dr. Zenos, is\r\nprofessor of theology in McCormick Seminary at Chicago. Dr. Mangasarian\r\nof the Chicago Society for Ethical Culture graduated in the class of\r\n’76. Our first class, graduated in 1868, was composed of two men, both\r\nof whom have since become distinguished. One of them is Professor\r\nHagopos Djedjizian, who occupies the chair of Armenian language and\r\nliterature in Robert College, and the other is Petco Gorbanoff, who has\r\noccupied several prominent positions in the government of Bulgaria and\r\nis now vice-president of its parliament.\r\n\r\n“Our graduates have played a most important part in the building up of\r\nBulgaria. We have furnished at least two prime ministers, Constantine\r\nStoiloff and Todor Ivantchoff; four ministers of foreign affairs,\r\nthree secretaries to the king, one secretary to the Bulgarian cabinet,\r\nthree attorney generals, two ministers of public works, a minister of\r\ncommerce and agriculture, a minister of the interior, a minister of\r\nfinance, a minister of posts and telegraphs, a director of the state\r\nrailways, three ministers of justice, a commissary general for the\r\nBulgarian army, the administrator of the Bulgarian national bank, the\r\nadministrator of the state agricultural bank, no less than twenty-two\r\nmembers of the Bulgarian parliament, and ten or twelve members of the\r\ndiplomatic service of that country.\r\n\r\n“You will find among the list of our alumni the names of two members\r\nof the deputation which selected Prince Ferdinand to be the sovereign\r\nof Bulgaria and offered him the crown, and the names of both the\r\ncommissioners to the St. Louis Exposition, Peter M. Mattheoff and\r\nDimiter M. Stantcheff. We have furnished ten or twelve professors\r\nfor the colleges of Bulgaria, numerous superintendents of schools,\r\nteachers, lawyers, doctors, dentists, and surgeons in the army.\r\n\r\n“You will find our alumni teaching in all the American schools and\r\ncolleges throughout Turkey, in Armenia, Macedonia, and other provinces.\r\nMost of our Greek graduates have gone into commercial life and\r\nseveral have been remarkably successful. They are the sons of Greek\r\nmerchants in Constantinople, Athens, Patras, and the islands of the\r\nMediterranean. Some of our Greek students have come from Russia also.\r\nThe Armenian graduates have generally gone into professional life, and\r\nhave been remarkably successful in medicine, law and education. Two of\r\nthem are now studying engineering in Edinburgh.”\r\n\r\n“What has become of your Turkish graduates?”\r\n\r\n“We have had only one Turkish graduate before this year and he is now\r\na teacher. Under the old régime Mohammedan boys were not permitted to\r\nattend Robert College. They frequently came, but the government ordered\r\nthem away. At one time we had two nephews of former Sultan Abdul Hamid,\r\nbut they remained only a few weeks. As soon as he heard they were\r\nstudying in a Christian college he sent for them, and we never saw them\r\nagain. But since the new order of things we have more applications from\r\nTurkish students than we can accommodate. We have fifty-four Turks\r\nnow on our rolls, and I reckon we turned away more than a hundred\r\nlast fall. Among them is a nephew of the superintendent of education\r\nand a grandson of the sheik of one of the orders of dervishes. The\r\nTurkish government is sending five students annually, selected by the\r\ndepartment of public instruction. The head of that department said to\r\nme:\r\n\r\n“‘Take these young men and make good Americans of them if you want to,\r\nbut make them good teachers; we need them for our schools; train these\r\nmen; we need good men in Turkey; make them good men.’”\r\n\r\n“Do you teach the Christian religion?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“We are absolutely non-sectarian, but try to practise the Christian\r\nreligion. We do not ask our students to become Christians, but every\r\nstudent who enters this institution has an opportunity to learn what\r\nthe Christian religion is, and can accept it if he pleases, but he is\r\nnever asked to do so. We have Mohammedans, Jews, Armenians, orthodox\r\nGreeks, Persians, Russians, Bulgarians, Servians, Bosnians, Egyptians,\r\nGermans, Englishmen, and altogether representatives of fifteen\r\ndifferent races and five different religions, and every one of them is\r\nrequired to attend daily prayers and the regular services on Sunday.\r\nThey sing Christian hymns; they hear Christian prayers; they listen to\r\nChristian sermons, according to the creed of the Congregational Church,\r\nbut the sermons are usually lectures on morality rather than doctrinal\r\nexhortations.\r\n\r\n“The students thus get the truth concerning religion in the chapel\r\non Sunday, as they do in the classroom concerning science, history,\r\nand geography on week days, and they can make such use of it as they\r\nplease. We have never had any complaints concerning the preaching.\r\nThe Jewish and the Moslem students are often among the most attentive\r\nlisteners to the sermons and the most punctual in their attendance upon\r\nprayers, but we never ask their impressions; we never discuss doctrinal\r\nquestions with them; we never invite their confidence; we never\r\ninterfere with the faith they profess.”\r\n\r\n“Have you received any congratulations from the Turkish government upon\r\nyour recent legacy?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Officially, no; but unofficially several members of the government\r\nhave sent us their congratulations. Robert College is now regarded not\r\nonly as a part of the Turkish educational system, but as an important\r\nagency in carrying out the plans of reform of the Young Turk party.\r\nThey have given us full recognition. Our students have the same\r\nprivileges as those of the Imperial University and the government\r\nlyceums. They will be exempt from military service until they finish\r\ntheir courses; our diplomas will be recognized for admission into\r\nthe Imperial University without examination, and the same applies to\r\nappointments in the civil service.\r\n\r\n“We had very little trouble with the old régime, although the former\r\nsultan was opposed to all modern ideas and especially American ideas,\r\nbecause they are inconsistent with his theory of administration. But\r\nthe present government is as far removed from that line as possible.\r\nIt favours all modern ideas and is especially friendly to American\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n“The government wants to subject Robert College and all other foreign\r\ninstitutions to the regulations of the Turkish laws of corporations.\r\nThey want us to be under Turkish control, to be incorporated as a\r\nTurkish association, and have a certain number of Turkish directors,\r\nbut I do not think they will insist upon it, because it would be\r\nentirely contrary to our charter. We are organized under the laws\r\nof New York. The title of our property is held in the name of an\r\nindividual and the use of our endowments and the proper management of\r\nour institution require that we shall continue on the same basis as we\r\nare now. None of the foreign corporations, however, is submitting to\r\nthe new arrangement. They decline to accept the conditions and we shall\r\ndo the same.”\r\n\r\n“Has there been any difference in the conduct of your students since\r\nthe constitution was proclaimed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; at first all over the empire there was a manifestation of a very\r\ncrude and vague idea of what they called liberty having possessed\r\nthe minds of inexperienced people. They thought liberty meant that\r\neverybody could do as he pleased, but they soon found out their\r\nmistake. They had the same delusions concerning equality. Liberty\r\nbecame license. In some of the Turkish schools the students refused\r\nto obey the teachers and tried to run things themselves; they drove\r\nthe teachers out of their rooms and insisted that they should sleep\r\nin the dormitories with the students. At Beirut the Moslems demanded\r\nexemption from compulsory attendance upon chapel and Bible classes;\r\nin some of our colleges the students insisted that, under the new\r\nconstitution, they had a right to come and go as they pleased; but that\r\nwave of hysteria soon passed over; all the institutions have resumed\r\ntheir normal condition and the greatest change that we see is a new\r\ninspiration to work and a realization of the opportunities that are\r\noffered educated men. Interest in education has increased to such a\r\ndegree that every school is filled, and the schools do not suffer from\r\nthe restrictions that often embarrassed them during the reign of Abdul\r\nHamid.\r\n\r\n“One of the most important reforms is the removal of restrictions upon\r\ntravel. In former times no citizen could go from one town to another\r\nwithout the permission of the authorities. That law has been abolished\r\nand now there is no interference with travel. Our students come and\r\ngo without passports. The people in the interior can go about and\r\ntrade with each other without interference. This has enlarged their\r\nmarkets; it has given them an opportunity to become acquainted; it\r\nbroadens their ideas; it removes prejudices and relieves the social\r\nand commercial stagnation that formerly kept them down. They can now\r\nread newspapers freely. They can read any books they like, and while\r\nno doubt the influence of some of the publications is pernicious, that\r\nfault will correct itself in time.”\r\n\r\n“The late revolution was the result of education, was it not?”\r\n\r\n“I think it most certainly was. The leaders of the Young Turk party\r\nwere educated either in Paris and elsewhere abroad or in the Turkish\r\nmilitary schools, and by that education they were able to realize the\r\ndeplorable condition of the empire and the necessity of the reforms\r\nwhich they have since accomplished.”\r\n\r\n“Is the present government doing any more for education than the old\r\none?”\r\n\r\n“It is doing a good deal. The department of public instruction has\r\nbeen thoroughly organized and is under progressive and intelligent\r\ndirection. Normal schools have been established, one for women and\r\none for men, which will assist to solve the greatest difficulties\r\nunder which the department is labouring, and that is the lack of\r\nteachers. Abdul Hamid reduced the university to nothing; the new\r\nrégime has restored it, enlarged its scope, and introduced new methods\r\nand many improvements. There has been a considerable increase in the\r\nappropriations for education and a general improvement has taken place\r\nin all the schools. The military schools of Turkey have always been the\r\nbest educational institutions in the empire, and their influence has\r\nbeen good. As a proof of that I can point to the moderation and good\r\njudgment shown by the military leaders in the recent revolution. Most\r\nof them were educated in the military schools.”\r\n\r\n“How far are the American colleges in the Ottoman Empire\r\nself-supporting?”\r\n\r\n“The conditions are about the same as among similar colleges at home.\r\nAbout two thirds, and in some cases three fourths, of the running\r\nexpenses are paid from the tuition fees, and the deficit must be met by\r\nendowments. American colleges in Turkey are not charitable institutions\r\nby any means. While they need endowments, and must have them in order\r\nto make both ends meet, they do not need them any more than Harvard, or\r\nYale, or Princeton, or any other college in Massachusetts or Kansas.\r\nThe same amount of money will go a great deal farther here than in\r\nthe United States, because our students do not expect so much, and\r\nthe standard of living is lower here. Hence, I am confident that the\r\nAmerican colleges in Turkey are more nearly self-supporting, on the\r\naverage, than similar institutions in the United States.”\r\n\r\nThere were at last accounts 447 American schools in Asia Minor, with\r\n23,846 students in all grades, from kindergartens to theological\r\nseminaries. The lower grades are entirely supported by the patrons; the\r\nhigher grades require a certain amount of assistance to maintain a high\r\nstandard, but no more than corresponding institutions in the United\r\nStates. There are hospitals connected with most of them, which are also\r\nvery important. In almost every case they are the only places in those\r\nsections of the country where the sick may receive medicines and care.\r\nSome of the hospitals are practically self-supporting, the fees of the\r\npatients and the sums paid for medicines being sufficient to meet the\r\ncost of attendance, supplies, and care.\r\n\r\nFew of the schools receive financial assistance from missionary boards,\r\nand whenever assistance is given it is with the understanding that it\r\nshall diminish as the income of the school increases. The people for\r\nwhom these institutions are provided appreciate the value of education\r\nand are willing to pay what they can for it. Methods of self-help\r\nare provided for students who cannot pay their tuition, so that their\r\nself-respect and independence are not disturbed. In the same way\r\nprovision is made for books. In the hospitals no one who is worthy is\r\never refused treatment or medicine, but those who are able to pay are\r\nrequired to do so.\r\n\r\nThis principle of self-support has been a fixed rule from the beginning\r\nin all missionary work in Turkey, and it has proved to be one of the\r\nmost important features of policy. Missionary physicians and teachers\r\nlearned at the start that they could accomplish more good by requiring\r\ncompensation for all services rendered, because in the Orient, as\r\nelsewhere, no real value attaches to that which costs nothing. Parents\r\nand pupils would be indifferent regarding attendance if the schools\r\nwere free; books would be easily lost or damaged or destroyed if they\r\nhad not been paid for; and where assistance is rendered to individuals\r\nit is arranged in such a way that the beneficiary shall be impressed\r\nwith the value of what he is receiving.\r\n\r\nThe five colleges and the many preparatory and high schools for men\r\nand women in Asia Minor have not less than 6,000 students, who are\r\nbeing trained for useful citizenship by a wide range of instruction in\r\nthe applied sciences, agriculture, chemistry, pharmacy, engineering,\r\nand even manual training. The courses of study are adapted to the\r\nneeds of the country and with a view to qualifying the students for\r\nthe highest service for their own people. There are six theological\r\nseminaries training young men for the ministry. Two of them are\r\nintended especially for workers among Arabic-speaking people, one for\r\nwork among the Armenians, another for the Turks, and others for Greeks\r\nand Bulgarians.\r\n\r\nIn these seminaries the largest number of students are natives of\r\nTurkey. Some of the graduates have afterward had the benefit of\r\npost-graduate training in Europe or the United States, but that is not\r\nencouraged. It has been demonstrated by many cases that students from\r\nTurkey who go to the United States find it difficult to return to their\r\nnative country, while others are made discontented by differences in\r\nconditions. It is the policy to employ native teachers and professors,\r\nso far as is consistent with maintaining a high intellectual and\r\nmoral tone in the schools. That is the rule in all lines of work.\r\nNo missionary is ever pastor of a native church. He supervises and\r\ndirects, but he leaves the active work to the natives.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest value of the educational work done in Turkey\r\nby the American missionaries has been its influence upon native\r\neducational methods; in setting a standard to native schools; in\r\nfurnishing text-books; and in awakening an ambition for learning. These\r\nmissionary schools have in a large measure caused a revolution in the\r\nsocial life of Turkey. Men and women who have graduated or have taken\r\npartial courses command the best positions in commerce and society and\r\nhave been most successful in professional life. Their services are\r\nsought for and they are able to command larger salaries than others who\r\nhave not enjoyed their advantages. Large numbers of former students\r\nare prosperous business men in the principal cities of Turkey, while\r\nothers are the leaders in their respective professions. Most of them\r\nare examples in the eyes of the community of the benefit and the value\r\nof an educational training.\r\n\r\nThe college at Beirut is not included in the estimate I have made.\r\nIt was established in 1866 by Rev. Daniel Bliss, who remained at the\r\nhead of it until a few years since, when his son succeeded him. It is\r\none of the most successful educational institutions in all the world,\r\nand one of the most prosperous. It has a campus of over forty acres,\r\na model plant of dormitories, laboratories, and lecture-rooms for\r\nbetween 700 and 800 students, representing fourteen different races and\r\nnationalities. No other institution between Athens and Tokio compares\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe International College at Smyrna is the youngest of the group of\r\nAmerican institutions, having been established in 1902. Under the\r\ndirection of Dr. Alexander MacLaclan it has had remarkable success,\r\nand has not only become self-supporting but two or three years ago the\r\ntrustees were astonished to find a surplus in their treasury. There\r\nis a faculty of twenty-two professors and instructors and between 350\r\nand 400 students, the largest number being Greeks. The International\r\nCollege has a wide field, because Smyrna is the second city in Asiatic\r\nTurkey, whose cosmopolitan and enterprising population, previous to\r\nits foundation, had no educational privileges nearer than Beirut or\r\nAthens and sent their young men to European universities. The great\r\npopularity and success of the college have undoubtedly been due to\r\nits non-sectarian policy, and while the Christian religion is the\r\ncorner stone of its foundation and attendance at chapel exercises and\r\nProtestant worship is required of Jews, Greeks, and Mahommedans, as\r\nwell as Christian students, every tendency to proselyting is avoided.\r\nThe courses are especially strong in the scientific branches, and\r\nthe college has been made a government meteorological station, with\r\nseismograph, a full set of apparatus for recording the weather and for\r\ntaking the time. The American College for Girls in Constantinople is\r\ndoing similar work.\r\n\r\nThe Central Turkey College at Aintab is 250 miles east of Tarsus in the\r\nvalley of the Euphrates. It was founded in 1874 by Rev. Dr. Trowbridge,\r\nwho died after he had placed it firmly upon its feet, and was succeeded\r\nby Dr. Merrill. The college has no endowment, but by reason of its\r\nmarvellous management has been practically self-supporting from the\r\nfirst. It has the reputation of being more sectarian than other\r\nAmerican institutions, and strongly Protestant, which is natural,\r\nbecause most of the students are studying for evangelical work.\r\nProtestantism is very strong in that section of Turkey. Three churches\r\nin Aintab and Marash have more than one thousand members each, and\r\ncongregations of 2,000 are not uncommon. Until recently there have been\r\nno Turks or Jews among the students of the Central Turkey College, and\r\nthe patronage has been drawn entirely from the native Protestants and\r\nArmenians, but since the constitution was proclaimed large numbers of\r\nMohammedans have matriculated, and President Merrill has provided a\r\nprivate room for them, where they can worship according to their own\r\ncustom. The medical department is especially important.\r\n\r\nAt Marash, a neighbouring city, is a prosperous college for women,\r\nstarted in 1882, with preparatory departments at Adana, Hajin, and\r\nAintab, all flourishing and popular, particularly since the new régime\r\nhas made it possible for Turkish families to send their girls to\r\nschool. At first, it was difficult to persuade even Protestant parents\r\nto educate their daughters. It was contrary to custom, but now that\r\nan educational “boom” has been started, these schools are overwhelmed\r\nwith applications from young women they cannot accommodate. Their\r\neducational standards are about the same as those of the average\r\nfinishing school for young women in the United States, and the same\r\ntext-books are used.\r\n\r\nThe college at Marash is on the Mount Holyoke plan. There has been\r\nanother college for women on the Mount Holyoke plan at Bitlis for more\r\nthan forty years, where two noble women, the Ely sisters, have been\r\ntraining wives and mothers for the passing and the coming generations.\r\nTheir usefulness cannot be even estimated.\r\n\r\nThere is a school for girls at Smyrna, founded in 1881, with 250\r\nstudents, and another at Adabazar, eighty miles from Constantinople,\r\nwith about one hundred students.\r\n\r\nA very promising American institution in Turkey is St. Paul’s College,\r\nat the ancient city of Tarsus, with a preparatory department known\r\nas St. Paul’s Academy, founded by the late Elliott F. Shepherd of\r\nNew York and chartered by the legislature of that state in 1887. Dr.\r\nHoward Crosby was the first president of the board of trustees. He\r\nwas succeeded by Dr. Henry Mitchell MacCracken, chancellor of the\r\nUniversity of New York. Daniel W. McWilliams is secretary, Frederick A.\r\nBooth is treasurer, and William Jay Schieffelin, a son-in-law of the\r\nlate Colonel Shepherd, is the other member of the board. The academy\r\nwas opened in the fall of 1888, the college in the following year, and\r\nthe first class graduated in June, 1893.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul’s is not a sectarian institution and is intended primarily\r\nto train young men in that part of Turkey to be useful citizens, with\r\na foundation of Christian learning. The language of the schools\r\nis English, the faculty are all Christians, and most of them are\r\nAmericans, and every year a number of the graduating class go up to the\r\ntheological seminaries of the American Board, or the medical department\r\nof the Presbyterian College at Beirut.\r\n\r\nTarsus, which, you will remember, was the birthplace of St. Paul, is\r\na thriving city, eighteen miles from the Mediterranean on the river\r\nCydnus, and is connected by rail with both Mersina, the port of the\r\nprovince of Cilicia and Adana. The buildings of the institute occupy\r\nan elevation in the suburbs and command a fascinating view of a great\r\nplain and a long line of the Taurus Mountains in the background.\r\nThere is no other institution for higher education within a six days’\r\njourney, and the educational boom that has recently broken out in\r\nTurkey has caused a rush of students from the most influential families\r\nin that part of the empire. Unfortunately only a few of them can be\r\ntaken care of. The capacity of the college is limited.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY LIFE PRESS, GARDEN CITY, N.

When in doubt, Transcriber kept the hyphens in\r\nend-of-line hyphenated words.\r\n\r\nMany simple typographical errors were silently corrected.\r\n\r\nText frequently uses “régime” and “regime”; both forms retained here.\r\n\r\nIllustrations in this eBook have been positioned between paragraphs\r\nand outside quotations. In versions of this eBook that support\r\nhyperlinks, the page references in the List of Illustrations lead to\r\nthe corresponding illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe original book included a large foldout map affixed to the inside\r\nback cover. The digitized source of this eBook divided that map into\r\nfour quadrants of unequal sizes. In the HTML versions of this eBook,\r\nthe map is displayable in several ways, including smaller and larger\r\nversions of the entire map and smaller and larger versions of its four\r\nquadrants. The Transcriber was unable to recombine the quadrants into a\r\nseamless single map. Some text in the smaller versions is not readable.\r\nThe larger versions of the map may not be included in some mobile (epub\r\nand mobi) versions of this eBook, but they are available at Project\r\nGutenberg.\r\n\r\nThe index was not systematically checked for proper alphabetization or\r\ncorrect page references.\r\n\r\nPage 3: Redundant book title removed.\r\n\r\nPage 453: “Hospitals, American” includes a reference to page 149. In\r\nthe original book, that page number was printed below the entry for\r\n“Howard, John”. Page 149 mentions an American hospital but does not\r\nmention John Howard.",
