LYALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volume into which Mr. Valentine Chirol has collected and republished\r\nhis valuable series of articles in _The Times_ upon Indian unrest is an\r\nimportant and very instructive contribution to the study of what is\r\nprobably the most arduous problem in the politics of our far-reaching\r\nEmpire. His comprehensive survey of the whole situation, the arrangement\r\nof evidence and array of facts, are not unlike what might have been\r\nfound in the Report of a Commission appointed to investigate the causes\r\nand the state of affairs to which the troubles that have arisen in India\r\nmay be ascribed.\r\n\r\nAt different times in the world's history the nations foremost in\r\ncivilization have undertaken the enterprise of founding a great European\r\ndominion in Asia, and have accomplished it with signal success. The\r\nMacedonian Greeks led the way; they were followed by the Romans; and in\r\nboth instances their military superiority and organizing genius enabled\r\nthem to subdue and govern for centuries vast populations in Western\r\nAsia. European science and literature flourished in the great cities of\r\nthe East, where the educated classes willingly accepted and supported\r\nforeign rulership as their barrier against a relapse into barbarism; nor\r\nhave we reason for believing that it excited unusual discontent or\r\ndisaffection among the Asiatic peoples. But the Greek and Roman Empires\r\nin Asia have disappeared long ago, leaving very little beyond scattered\r\nruins; and in modern times it is the British dominion in India that has\r\nrevived and is pursuing the enterprise of ruling and civilizing a great\r\nAsiatic population, of developing the political intelligence and\r\ntransforming the ideas of an antique and, in some respects, a primitive\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThat the task must be one of prodigious difficulty, not always free from\r\ndanger, has been long known to those who watched the experiment with\r\nsome accurate foresight of the conditions attending it. Yet the recent\r\nsymptoms of virulent disease in some parts of the body politic, though\r\nconfined to certain provinces of India, have taken the British nation by\r\nsurprise. Mr. Chirol's book has now exhibited the present state and\r\nprospect of the adventure; he has examined the causes and the\r\nconsequences of the prevailing unrest; he has collected ample evidence,\r\nand he has consulted all the best authorities, Indian and European, on\r\nthe subject. His masterly analysis of all this material shows wide\r\nacquaintance with the facts, and rare insight into the character and\r\nmotives, the aims and methods, of those who are engaged in stirring up\r\nthe spirit of revolt against the British Government. He has pointed to\r\ninstances where the best intentions of the administrators have led them\r\nwrong; his whole narrative illustrates the perils that beset a\r\nGovernment necessarily pledged to moral and material reform, which finds\r\nits own principles perverted against its efforts, and its foremost\r\nopponents among the class that has been the first to profit by the\r\nbenefits which that Government has conferred upon them.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century had been pre-eminently an era of the development\r\nof rapid and easy communication between distant parts of the world,\r\nparticularly between Europe and Asia. So long as these two continents\r\nremained far apart the condition of Asia was unchanged and stationary;\r\nif there was any change it had been latterly retrogressive, for in\r\nIndia at any rate the eighteenth century was a period of abnormal and\r\nextensive political confusion. In Europe, on the other hand, national\r\nwealth, scientific discoveries, the arts of war and peace, had made\r\nextraordinary progress. Population had increased and multiplied; and\r\npartly by territorial conquests, partly by pacific penetration, the\r\nWestern nations overflowed politically into Asia during the nineteenth\r\ncentury. They brought with them larger knowledge, novel ideas and\r\nmanners, which have opened the Asiatic mind to new influences and\r\naspirations, to the sense of needs and grievances not previously felt or\r\neven imagined. The effect, as can now be clearly perceived, has been to\r\nproduce an abrupt transition from old to new ways, from the antique\r\norder of society towards fresh models; and to this may be ascribed the\r\ngeneral unsettlement, the uneasy stir, that pervade Asia at the present\r\nmoment. Its equilibrium has been disturbed by the high speed at which\r\nEurope has been pushing eastward; and the principal points of contact\r\nand penetration are in India.\r\n\r\nMoreover, towards the latter end of the nineteenth century and in the\r\nfirst years of the present century came events which materially altered\r\nthe attitude of Asiatic nations towards European predominance. The\r\ndefeat of the Italians by the Abyssinians in 1896 may indeed be noted as\r\nthe first decisive victory gained by troops that may be reckoned\r\nOriental over a European army in the open field, for at least three\r\ncenturies. The Japanese war, in which Russia lost battles not only by\r\nland, but also at sea, was even a more significant and striking warning\r\nthat the era of facile victories in Asia had ended; since never before\r\nin all history had an Asiatic navy won a great sea-fight against\r\nEuropean fleets. That the unquiet spirit, which from these general\r\ncauses has been spreading over the Eastern Continent, should be\r\nparticularly manifest in countries under European Governments is not\r\nunnatural; it inevitably roused the latent dislike of foreign rule,\r\nwith which a whole people is never entirely content. Precisely similar\r\nsymptoms are to be observed in the Asiatic possessions of France, and in\r\nEgypt; nor is Algeria yet altogether reconciled to the _régime_ of its\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\nThat in India the British Government has found the centres of active\r\ndisaffection located in the Maratha country and in Lower Bengal, is a\r\nphenomenon which can be to a large extent accounted for by reference to\r\nAnglo-Indian history. The fact that Poona is one focus of sedition has\r\nbeen attributed in this volume to the survival among the Maratha\r\nBrahmins of the recollection that \"far into the eighteenth century Poona\r\nwas the capital of a theocratic State in which behind the Throne of the\r\nPeshwas both spiritual and secular authority were concentrated in the\r\nhands of the Brahmins.\" The Peshwas, as their title implies, had been\r\nhereditary Ministers who governed in the name of the reigning dynasty\r\nfounded by the famous Maratha leader Sivajee, whose successors they set\r\naside. But before the end of the eighteenth century the secular\r\nauthority of the Peshwas had become almost nominal, and the real power\r\nin the State had passed into the grasp of a confederation of chiefs of\r\npredatory armies, whose violence drove the last Peshwa, more than a\r\ncentury ago, to seek refuge in a British camp. The political sovereignty\r\nof the Brahmins had disappeared from the time when he placed himself\r\nunder British protection; and the Maratha chiefs (who were not Brahmins)\r\nonly acknowledged our supremacy after some fiercely contested battles;\r\nwith the result that they were confined to and confirmed in the\r\npossession of the territories now governed by their descendants. But it\r\nis quite true that to the memory of a time when for once, and once only,\r\nin Indian history, their caste established a great secular dominion, may\r\nbe ascribed the tendency to disloyalty among the Maratha Brahmins.\r\n\r\nThe case of Bengal is very different. Poona and Calcutta are separated\r\ngeographically almost by the whole breadth of India between two seas;\r\nyet the historical antecedents of the Bengalees and Marathas are even\r\nfurther apart. The Marathas were the leaders of revolt against the\r\nMoghal Empire; they were formidable opponents to the rise of the British\r\npower; their chiefs fought hard before yielding to British authority. On\r\nthe other hand, Lower Bengal belonged to a province that had fallen away\r\nfrom the Moghal Empire, and which was transferred from its Mahomedan\r\nGovernor to a British General by the result of a single battle at\r\nPlassey. The Bengalees took no part in the contest, and they had very\r\ngood reason for willing acquiescence in the change of masters.\r\n\r\nIn a comparison, therefore, of the Marathas with the people of Bengal,\r\nwe have a remarkable instance of the production of similar effects from\r\ncauses very distinct and dissimilar. In the former case their present\r\nunrest may be traced, in a large degree, to the memories of early\r\nrulership and to warlike traditions. In the latter case there can be no\r\nsuch recollections, military or political, for the country has had no\r\nexperience whatever of a state of war, since Lower Bengal is perhaps the\r\nonly considerable province of India which has enjoyed profound peace\r\nduring nearly 150 years. It is no paradox to suggest that this prolonged\r\ntranquillity has had some share in stimulating the audacity of Bengalee\r\nunrest, for the literary classes seem to have no clear notion that the\r\nreal game of revolutionary politics is necessarily rough and\r\ndangerous--certain, moreover, to fail whenever the British Government\r\nshall have resolved that it is being carried too far, and must end.\r\n\r\nBut it is beyond question that the promoters of disaffection on both\r\nsides of India have been making strenuous exertions to enlist in the\r\nmovement the influence of Brahminism; and upon this point the book\r\nrightly lays particular stress.\r\n\r\nThe position and privileges of the Brahmins are rightly compared to\r\nthose of the Levites; they are the depositories of orthodox tradition;\r\nthey preside over and hold (not exclusively) a monopoly for the\r\nperformance of the sacred rites and offices; and ritual in Hinduism, as\r\nin most of the ancient religions, is the essential element; it is\r\nclosely connected with the rules of caste, which unite and divide\r\ninnumerable groups within the pale of Hinduism. And in India the\r\npeculiar institution of caste, the strict regulation of social\r\nintercourse, particularly in regard to inter-marriage and the sharing of\r\nfood, prevails to an extent quite unknown elsewhere in the world. The\r\ndivisions of caste have always operated to weaken the body politic in\r\nIndia, and thus to facilitate foreign conquest; but, on the other hand,\r\nthey have opposed a stiff barrier to the invasion of foreign religions,\r\nto the fusion of alien races with the Hindu people, and to any success\r\nin what may be called national unification.\r\n\r\nOne can easily understand the formidable power invested by this system\r\nin the Brahmins, and the enormous obstacles that it might raise against\r\nthe introduction of Western ideas, manners, and education. Nevertheless\r\nwe all know, and we have seen it with real satisfaction, that the\r\nBrahmins, very much to the credit of their intelligence and sagacity,\r\nhave been forward in accepting the new learning, the expansion of\r\ngeneral knowledge, offered to them by English schools and Universities;\r\nthey have acquired our language, they have studied our sciences; they\r\nare prominent in the professions of law and medicine, which the English\r\nhave created; they enter our civil services, they even serve in the\r\nIndian Army. Yet their readiness to adopt secular culture does not seem\r\nto have abated their religious authority, or to have sensibly weakened\r\ntheir influence over the people at large. And indeed the fact that the\r\nBrahmins, with others of the educated classes, should have been able,\r\nfor their own purposes, to appeal simultaneously to the darkest\r\nsuperstitions of Hinduism and to extreme ideas of Western democracy--to\r\ndisregard caste rules personally and to stir up caste prejudices among\r\nthe masses--will not greatly surprise those who have observed the\r\nextraordinary elasticity of practical Hinduism, the fictions and\r\nanomalies which can be invented or tolerated at need. But the beliefs\r\nand practices of popular Hinduism are obviously irreconcilable with the\r\nprinciples of modern civilization; and the various indications of a\r\ndesire to reform and purify their ancient religion may be partly due to\r\nthe perception among educated Hindus that so contradictory a position is\r\nultimately untenable, that the incongruity between sacrifices to the\r\ngoddess Kali and high University degrees is too manifest.\r\n\r\nThe course and consequences of the measures taken by the British\r\nGovernment to promote Western education in India has been attentively\r\nstudied by the author of this volume. It is a story of grave political\r\nmiscalculation, containing a lesson that has its significance for other\r\nnations which have undertaken a similar enterprise. Ignorance is\r\nunquestionably the root of many evils; and it was natural that in the\r\nlast century certain philosophers should have assumed education to be\r\nthe certain cure for human delusions; and that statesmen like Macaulay\r\nshould have declared education to be the best and surest remedy for\r\npolitical discontent and for law-breaking. In any case it was the clear\r\nand imperative duty of the British Government to attempt the\r\nintellectual emancipation of India as the best justification of British\r\nrule. We have since discovered, by experience, that, although education\r\nis a sovereign remedy for many ills--is indeed indispensable to healthy\r\nprogress--yet an indiscriminate or superficial administration of this\r\npotent medicine may engender other disorders. It acts upon the frame of\r\nan antique society as a powerful dissolvent, heating weak brains,\r\nstimulating rash ambitions, raising inordinate expectations of which the\r\ndisappointment is bitterly resented. That these effects are well known\r\neven in Europe may be read in a remarkable French novel published not\r\nlong ago, \"Les Déracinés,\" which, describes the road to ruin taken by\r\npoor collegians who had been uprooted from the soil of their humble\r\nvillage. And in Asia the disease is necessarily much more virulent,\r\nbecause the transition has been more sudden, and the contrast between\r\nold ideas of life and new aspirations is far sharper. From the report of\r\nan able French official upon the Indo-Chinese Colonies we may learn that\r\nthe existing system of educating the natives has proved to be\r\nmischievous, needing radical reform. Of the Levantine youths in the\r\nSyrian towns, the product of European schools, a French traveller writes\r\n(1909), \"C'est une tourbe de déclassés\"; while in China some leaders of\r\nagitation for democratic changes in the oldest of all Empires are said\r\nto be those who have qualified by competitive examination for public\r\nemploy, and have failed to obtain it. In every country the crowd of\r\nexpectants far outnumbers the places available. If, indeed, the\r\nGovernment which introduced Western education into Bengal had been\r\nnative instead of foreign, it would have found itself entangled in\r\ndifficulties no less grave than those which now confront the British\r\nrulers; and there can be little doubt that it would probably have broken\r\ndown under them.\r\n\r\nThe phases through which the State's educational policy in India have\r\npassed during the last fifty years are explained at length in this\r\nvolume. The Government was misled in the wrong direction by the reports\r\nof two Commissions between 1880 and 1890, whose mistakes were discerned\r\nat the time by those who had some tincture of political prudence. The\r\nproblem is now to reconstruct on a better plan, to try different lines\r\nof advance. But some of us have heard of an enterprising pioneer in a\r\ndifficult country, who confidently urged travellers to take a new route\r\nby assuring them that it avoided the hills on the old road. Whether the\r\nhills were equally steep on his other road he did not say. And in the\r\npresent instance it may not be easy to strike out a fresh path which may\r\nbe clear from the complications that have been suffered to grow up\r\nround our system of Indian education; while no one proposes to turn\r\nback. The truth is that in India the English have been throughout\r\nobliged to lay out their own roads, and to feel their way, without any\r\nprecedents to guide them. No other Government, European or Asiatic, has\r\nyet essayed to administer a great Oriental population, alien in race and\r\nreligion, by institutions of a representative type, reckoning upon free\r\ndiscussion and an unrestricted Press for reasonable consideration of its\r\nmeasures and fair play, relying upon secular education and absolute\r\nreligious neutrality to control the unruly affections of sinful men. It\r\nis now seen that our Western ideas and inventions, moral and material,\r\nare being turned against us by some of those to whom we have imparted an\r\nelementary aptitude for using them. And thus we have the strange\r\nspectacle, in certain parts of India, of a party capable of resorting to\r\nmethods that are both reactionary and revolutionary, of men who offer\r\nprayers and sacrifices to ferocious divinities and denounce the\r\nGovernment by seditious journalism, preaching primitive superstition in\r\nthe very modern form of leading articles. The mixture of religion with\r\npolitics has always produced a highly explosive compound, especially in\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nThese agitations are in fact the symptoms of what are said by\r\nShakespeare to be the \"cankers of a calm world\"; they are the natural\r\noutcome of artificial culture in an educational hothouse, among classes\r\nwho have had for generations no real training in rough or hazardous\r\npolitics. The outline of the present situation in India is that we have\r\nbeen disseminating ideas of abstract political right, and the germs of\r\nrepresentative institutions, among a people that had for centuries been\r\ngoverned autocratically, and in a country where local liberties and\r\nhabits of self-government had been long obliterated or had never\r\nexisted. At the same time we have been spreading modern education\r\nbroadcast throughout the land, where, before English rule, learning had\r\nnot advanced beyond the stage of Europe in the middle ages. These may\r\nbe taken to be the primary causes of the existing Unrest; and meanwhile\r\nthe administrative machine has been so efficiently organized, it has\r\nrun, hitherto, so easily and quietly, as to disguise from inexperienced\r\nbystanders the long discipline and training in affairs of State that are\r\nrequired for its management. Nor is it clearly perceived that the real\r\ndriving power lies in the forces held in reserve by the British nation\r\nand in the respect which British guardianship everywhere commands. That\r\nIndians should be liberally invited to share the responsibilities of\r\nhigh office is now a recognized principle of public policy. But the\r\nprocess of initiation must be gradual and tentative; and vague notions\r\nof dissolving the British connexion only prove incompetence to realize\r\nthe whole situation, external and internal, of the country. Across the\r\nfrontiers of India are warlike nations, who are intent upon arming\r\nthemselves after the latest modern pattern, though for the other\r\nbenefits of Western science and learning they show, as yet, very little\r\ntaste or inclination. They would certainly be a serious menace to a weak\r\nGovernment in the Indian plains, while their sympathy with a literary\r\nclass would be uncommonly slight. Against intruders of this sort the\r\nBritish hold securely the gates of India; and it must be clear that the\r\ncivilization and future prosperity of the whole country depend entirely\r\nupon their determination to maintain public tranquillity by strict\r\nenforcement of the laws; combined with their policy of admitting the\r\nhighest intellects and capacities to the Councils of the State, and of\r\nassigning reasonable administrative and legislative independence to the\r\ngreat provinces in accord with the unity of a powerful Empire.\r\n\r\nA.C. LYALL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA GENERAL SURVEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat there is a lull in the storm of unrest which has lately swept over\r\nIndia is happily beyond doubt. Does this lull indicate a gradual and\r\nsteady return to more normal and peaceful conditions? Or, as in other\r\ncyclonic disturbances in tropical climes, does it merely presage fiercer\r\noutbursts yet to come? Has the blended policy of repression and\r\nconcession adopted by Lord Morley and Lord Minto really cowed the forces\r\nof criminal disorder and rallied the representatives of moderate opinion\r\nto the cause of sober and Constitutional progress? Or has it come too\r\nlate either permanently to arrest the former or to restore confidence\r\nand courage to the latter?\r\n\r\nThese are the two questions which the present situation in India most\r\nfrequently and obviously suggests, but it may be doubted whether they by\r\nany means cover the whole field of potential developments. They are\r\nbased apparently upon the assumption that Indian unrest, even in its\r\nmost extreme forms, is merely the expression of certain political\r\naspirations towards various degrees of emancipation from British\r\ntutelage, ranging from a larger share in the present system of\r\nadministration to a complete revolution in the existing relations\r\nbetween Great Britain and India, and that, the issues thus raised being\r\nessentially political, they can be met by compromise on purely political\r\nlines. This assumption ignores, I fear, certain factors of very great\r\nimportance, social, religious, and economic, which profoundly affect, if\r\nthey do not altogether overshadow, the political problem. The question\r\nto which I propose to address myself is whether Indian unrest represents\r\nmerely, as we are prone to imagine, the human and not unnatural\r\nimpatience of subject races fretting under an alien rule which, however\r\nwell intentioned, must often be irksome and must sometimes appear to be\r\nharsh and arbitrary; or whether to-day, in its more extreme forms at any\r\nrate, it does not represent an irreconcilable reaction against all that\r\nnot only British rule but Western civilization stands for.\r\n\r\nI will not stop at present to discuss how far the lamentable\r\ndeficiencies of the system of education which we have ourselves\r\nintroduced into India have contributed to the Indian unrest. That that\r\nsystem has been productive of much good few will deny, but few also can\r\nbe so blind as to ignore the fact that it tends on the one hand to\r\ncreate a semi-educated proletariate, unemployed and largely\r\nunemployable, and on the other hand, even where failure is less\r\ncomplete, to produce dangerous hybrids, more or less superficially\r\nimbued with Western ideas, and at the same time more or less completely\r\ndivorced from the realities of Indian life. Many other circumstances\r\nalso which have helped the promoters of disaffection I must reserve for\r\nsubsequent discussion. Some of them are economic, such as the remarkable\r\nrise in prices during the last decade. This has seriously enhanced the\r\ncost of living in India and has specially affected the very classes\r\namongst whom disaffection is most widespread. The clerk, the teacher,\r\nthe petty Government official, whose exiguous salaries have remained the\r\nsame, find themselves to-day relatively, and in many cases actually,\r\nworse off than the artisan or even the labourer, whose wages have in\r\nmany cases risen in proportion to the increased cost of living. Plague,\r\nwhich in the course of the last 14 years has carried off over 6,000,000\r\npeople, and two terrible visitations of famine have caused in different\r\nparts of the country untold misery and consequent bitterness. On the\r\nother hand, the growth of commerce and industry and the growing interest\r\ntaken by all classes in commercial and industrial questions have led to\r\na corresponding resentment of the fiscal restraints placed upon India by\r\nthe Imperial Government for the selfish benefit, as it is contended, of\r\nthe British manufacturer and trader. Much bad blood has undoubtedly been\r\ncreated by the treatment of British Indians in South Africa and the\r\nattitude adopted in British Colonies generally towards Asiatic\r\nimmigrants. The social relations between the two races in India\r\nitself--always a problem of infinite difficulty--have certainly not been\r\nimproved by the large influx of a lower class of Europeans which the\r\ndevelopment of railways and telegraphs and other industries requiring\r\ntechnical knowledge have brought in their train. Nor can it be denied\r\nthat the growing pressure of office work as well as the increased\r\nfacilities of home leave and frequent transfers from one post to another\r\nhave inevitably to some extent lessened the contact between the\r\nAnglo-Indian official and the native population. Of more remote\r\ninfluences which have indirectly reacted upon the Indian mind it may\r\nsuffice for the present to mention the South African War, which lowered\r\nthe prestige of our arms, and the Russo-Japanese War, which was regarded\r\nas the first blow dealt to the ascendency of Europe over Asia, though it\r\nmay be worth noting that in his novel, \"The Prince of Destiny,\" Mr. Surat\r\nKumar Ghosh lays repeated emphasis on the impression produced in India\r\nsome years earlier by the defeat of the Italian forces in Abyssinia.\r\nEach of the above points has its own importance and deserves to be\r\nclosely studied, for upon the way in which we shall in the future handle\r\nsome of the delicate questions which they raise will largely depend our\r\nfailure or our success in coping with Indian unrest--that is, in\r\npreventing its invasion of other classes than those to which it has been\r\nhitherto confined. But the clue to the real spirit which informs Indian\r\nunrest must be sought elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTwo misconceptions appear to prevail very widely at home with regard to\r\nthe nature of the unrest. The first is that disaffection of a virulent\r\nand articulate character is a new phenomenon in India; the second is\r\nthat the existing: disaffection represents a genuine, if precocious and\r\nmisdirected, response on the part of the Western educated classes to the\r\ndemocratic ideals of the modern Western world which our system of\r\neducation has imported into India. It is easy to account for the\r\nprevalence of both these misconceptions. We are a people of notoriously\r\nshort memory, and, when a series of sensational dastardly crimes,\r\nfollowing on a tumultuous agitation in Bengal and a campaign of\r\nincredible violence in the native Press, at last aroused and alarmed the\r\nBritish public, the vast majority of Englishmen were under the\r\nimpression that since the black days of the Mutiny law and order had\r\nnever been seriously assailed in India, and they therefore rushed to the\r\nconclusion that, if the _pax Britannica_ had been so rudely and suddenly\r\nshaken, the only possible explanation lay in some novel wave of\r\nsentiment or some grievous administrative blunder which had abruptly\r\ndisturbed the harmonious relations between the rulers and the ruled.\r\nPeople had forgotten that disaffection in varying forms and degrees of\r\nintensity has existed at all times amongst certain sections of the\r\npopulation, and under the conditions of our rule can hardly be expected\r\nto disappear altogether. Whether British statesmanship has always\r\nsufficiently reckoned with its existence is another question. More than\r\n30 years ago, for instance, the Government of India had to pass a Bill\r\ndealing with the aggressive violence of the vernacular Press on\r\nprecisely the same grounds that were alleged in support of this year's\r\nPress Bill, and with scarcely less justification, whilst just 13 years\r\nago two British officials fell victims at Poona to a murderous\r\nconspiracy, prompted by a campaign of criminal virulence in the Press,\r\nclosely resembling those which have more recently robbed India of many\r\nvaluable lives.\r\n\r\nTo imagine that Indian unrest has been a sudden growth because its\r\noutward manifestations have assumed new and startling forms of violence\r\nis a dangerous delusion; and no less misleading is the assumption that\r\nit is merely the outcome of Western education or the echo of Western\r\ndemocratic aspirations, because it occasionally, and chiefly for\r\npurposes of political expediency, adopts the language of Western\r\ndemagogues. Whatever its modes of expression, its main spring is a\r\ndeep-rooted antagonism to all the principles upon which Western society,\r\nespecially in a democratic country like England, has been built up. It\r\nis in that antagonism--in the increasing violence of that\r\nantagonism--which is a conspicuous feature of the unrest, that the\r\ngravest danger lies.\r\n\r\nBut if in this respect the problems with which we are confronted appear\r\nto me more serious and complex than official optimism is sometimes\r\ndisposed to admit, I have no hesitation is saying that there is no cause\r\nfor despondency if we will only realize how strong our position in India\r\nstill is, and use our strength wisely and sympathetically, but, at the\r\nsame time, with firmness and consistency. It is important to note at the\r\noutset that the more dangerous forms of unrest are practically confined\r\nto the Hindus, and amongst them to a numerically small proportion of the\r\nvast Hindu community. Not a single Mahomedan has been implicated in,\r\nthough some have fallen victims to, the criminal conspiracies of the\r\nlast few years. Not a single Mahomedan of any account is to be found in\r\nthe ranks of disaffected politicians. For reasons, in fact, which I\r\nshall set forth later on, it may be confidently asserted that never\r\nbefore have the Mahomedans of India as a whole identified their\r\ninterests and their aspirations so closely as at the present day with\r\nthe consolidation and permanence of British rule. It is almost a\r\nmisnomer to speak of Indian unrest. Hindu unrest would be a far more\r\naccurate term, connoting with far greater precision the forces\r\nunderlying it, though to use it without reservation would be to do a\r\ngrave injustice to the vast numbers of Hindus who are as yet untainted\r\nwith disaffection. These include almost all the Hindu ruling chiefs and\r\nlanded aristocracy, as well as the great mass of the agricultural\r\nclasses which form in all parts of India the overwhelming majority of\r\nthe population. Very large areas, moreover, are still entirely free from\r\nunrest, which, except for a few sporadic outbreaks in other districts,\r\nhas been hitherto mainly confined to three distinct areas--the Mahratta\r\nDeccan, which comprises a great part of the Bombay Presidency and\r\nseveral districts of the Central Provinces, Bengal, with the new\r\nprovince of Eastern Bengal, and the Punjab. In those regions it is the\r\nlarge cities that have been the real hot-beds of unrest, and, great as\r\nis their influence, it must not be forgotten that in India scarcely\r\none-tenth of the population lives in cities, or even in small townships\r\nwith more than 5,000 inhabitants. Whereas in England one-third of the\r\npopulation is gathered together in crowded cities of 100,000 inhabitants\r\nand over, there are but twenty-eight cities of that size in the whole of\r\nIndia, with an aggregate population of less than 7,000,000 out of a\r\ntotal of almost 300,000,000.\r\n\r\nThat a movement confined to a mere fraction of the population of India\r\nhas no title to be called a \"national\" movement would scarcely need to\r\nbe argued, even if the variegated jumble of races and peoples, castes\r\nand creeds that make up the population of India were not in itself an\r\nantithesis to all that the word \"national\" implies. Nevertheless it\r\nwould be equally foolish to underrate the forces which underlie this\r\nmovement, for they have one common _nexus_, and a very vital one. They\r\nare the dominant forces of Hinduism--forces which go to the very root of\r\na social and religious system than which none in the history of the\r\nhuman race has shown greater vitality and stability. Based upon caste,\r\nthe most rigid of all social classifications, Hinduism has secured for\r\nsome 3,000 years or more to the higher castes, and especially to the\r\nBrahmans, the highest of all castes, a social supremacy for which there\r\nis no parallel elsewhere. At the same time, inflexibly as they have\r\ndominated Hinduism, these higher castes have themselves preserved a\r\nflexibility of mind and temper which has enabled them to adapt\r\nthemselves with singular success to the vicissitudes of changing times\r\nwithout any substantial sacrifice of their inherited traditions and\r\naspirations. Thus it is amongst high-caste Hindus that for the last\r\nthree-quarters of a century English education has chiefly spread, and,\r\nindeed, been most eagerly welcomed; it is amongst them that British\r\nadministration has recruited the great majority of its native servants\r\nin every branch of the public service; it is amongst them also that are\r\nchiefly recruited the liberal professions, the Press, the\r\nschoolmasters--in fact all those agencies through which public opinion\r\nand the mind of the rising generation are most easily moulded and\r\ndirected. That it is amongst them also that the spirit of revolt against\r\nBritish ascendency is chiefly and almost exclusively rife constitutes\r\nthe most ominous feature of Indian unrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSWARAJ ON THE PLATFORM AND IN THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to describe the methods by which Indian unrest has\r\nbeen fomented, and to study as far as possible its psychology, it may be\r\nwell to set forth succinctly the political purpose to which it is\r\ndirected, as far as there is any unity of direction. One of the chief\r\ndifficulties one encounters in attempting to define its aims is the\r\nvagueness that generally characterizes the pronouncements of Indian\r\npoliticians. There is, indeed, one section that makes no disguise either\r\nof its aspirations or of the way in which it proposes to secure their\r\nfulfilment. Its doctrines are frankly revolutionary, and it openly\r\npreaches propaganda by deed--i.e., by armed revolt, if and when it\r\nbecomes practicable, and, in the meantime, by assassination, dynamite\r\noutrages, dacoities, and all the other methods of terrorism dear to\r\nanarchists all over the world. But that section is not very numerous,\r\nnor would it in itself be very dangerous, if it did not exercise so\r\nfatal a fascination upon the immature mind of youth. The real difficulty\r\nbegins when one comes to that much larger section of \"advanced\"\r\npoliticians who are scarcely less bitterly opposed to the maintenance of\r\nBritish rule, but, either from prudential motives or lest they should\r\nprematurely alarm and alienate the representatives of what is called\r\n\"moderate\" opinion, shrink from the violent assertion of India's claim\r\nto complete political independence and, whilst helping to create the\r\natmosphere that breeds outrages, profess to deprecate them.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is further enhanced by the reluctance of many of the\r\n\"moderates\" to break with their \"advanced\" friends by proclaiming, once\r\nand for all, their own conviction that within no measurable time can\r\nIndia in her own interests afford to forgo the guarantees of internal\r\npeace and order and external security which the British _Raj_ alone can\r\nafford. Hence the desire on both sides to find some common denominator\r\nin a nebulous formula which each can interpret as to time and manner\r\naccording to its own desires and aims. That formula seems to have been\r\ndiscovered in the term _Swaraj_, or self-rule, which, when\r\neuphemistically translated into Colonial self-government for India,\r\noffers the additional advantage of presenting the political aspirations\r\nof Indian \"Nationalism\" in the form least likely to alarm Englishmen,\r\nespecially those who do not care or wish to look below the surface and\r\nwhose sympathies are readily won by any catchword that appeals to\r\nsentimental Liberalism. Now if _Swaraj_, or Colonial self-government,\r\nrepresents the _minimum_ that will satisfy Indian Nationalists, it is\r\nimportant to know exactly what in their view it really means.\r\nFortunately on this point we have some _data_ of indisputable authority.\r\nThey are furnished in the speeches of an \"advanced\" leader, who does not\r\nrank amongst the revolutionary extremists, though his refusal to give\r\nevidence in the trial of a seditious newspaper with which he had been\r\nconnected brought him in 1907 within the scope of the Indian Criminal\r\nCode. Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal, a high-caste Hindu and a man of great\r\nintellectual force and high character, has not only received a Western\r\neducation, but has travelled a great deal in Europe and in America, and\r\nis almost as much at home in London as in Calcutta. A little more than\r\nthree years ago he delivered in Madras a series of lectures on the \"New\r\nSpirit,\" which have been republished in many editions and may be\r\nregarded as the most authoritative programme of \"advanced\" political\r\nthought in India. What adds greatly to the significance of those\r\nspeeches is that Mr. Pal borrowed their keynote from the Presidential\r\naddress delivered in the preceding year by the veteran leader of the\r\n\"moderates,\" Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, at the annual Session of the Indian\r\nNational Congress. The rights of India, Mr. Naoroji had said, \"can be\r\ncomprised in one word--self-government or _Swaraj_, like that of the\r\nUnited Kingdom or the Colonies.\" It was reserved for Mr. Pal to define\r\nprecisely how such _Swaraj_ could be peacefully obtained and what it\r\nmust ultimately lead to. He began by brushing away the notion that any\r\npolitical concessions compatible with the present dependency of India\r\nupon Great Britain could help India to _Swaraj_. I will quote his own\r\nwords, which already foreshadowed the contemptuous reception given by\r\n\"advanced\" politicians to the reforms embodied in last year's Indian\r\nCouncils Act:--\r\n\r\n   You may get a High Court judgeship here, membership\r\n   of the Legislative Council there, possibly an Executive\r\n   Membership of the Council. Or do you want an expansion\r\n   of the Legislative Councils? Do you want that a few Indians\r\n   shall sit as your representatives in the House of Commons?\r\n   Do you want a large number of Indians in the Civil Service?\r\n   Let us see whether 50, 100, 200, or 300 civilians will make\r\n   the Government our own.... The whole Civil Service\r\n   might be Indian, but the Civil servants have to carry out\r\n   orders--they cannot direct, they cannot dictate the policy.\r\n   One swallow does not make the summer. One civilian,\r\n   100 or 1,000 civilians in the service of the British Government\r\n   will not make that Government Indian. There are traditions,\r\n   there are laws, there are policies to which every civilian, be\r\n   he black or brown or white, must submit, and as long as\r\n   these traditions have not been altered, as long as these principles\r\n   have not been amended, as long as that policy has not\r\n   been radically changed, the supplanting of European by\r\n   Indian agency will not make for self-government in this\r\n   country.\r\n\r\nNor is it from the British Government that Mr. Pal looks for, or would\r\naccept, _Swaraj_:--\r\n\r\n   If the Government were to come and tell me to-day \"Take\r\n   _Swaraj\" I would say thank you for the gift, but I will not\r\n   have that which I cannot acquire by my own hand....\r\n   Our programme is that we shall so work in the country,\r\n   so combine the resources of the people, so organize the forces\r\n   of the nation, so develop the instincts of freedom in the community,\r\n   that by this means we shall--_shall_ in the imperative--compel\r\n   the submission to our will of any power that may set\r\n   itself against us.\r\n\r\nEqually definite is Mr. Pal as to the methods by which _Swaraj_ is to be\r\nmade \"imperative.\" They consist of _Swadeshi_ in the economic domain,\r\ni.e., the encouragement of native industries reinforced by the boycott\r\nof imported goods which will kill British commerce and, in the political\r\ndomain, passive resistance reinforced by the boycott of Government\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n   They say:--Can you boycott all the Government offices?\r\n   Whoever said that we would? Whoever said that there\r\n   would not be found a single Indian to serve the Government\r\n   or the European community here? But what we can do is this.\r\n   We can make the Government impossible without entirely\r\n   making it impossible for them to find people to serve them.\r\n   The administration may be made impossible in a variety of\r\n   ways. It is not actually that every deputy magistrate\r\n   should say: I won't serve in it. It is not that when one\r\n   man resigns nobody will be found to take his place. But\r\n   if you create this spirit in the country the Government service\r\n   will gradually imbibe this spirit, and a whole office may go\r\n   on strike. That does not put an end to the administration,\r\n   but it creates endless complications in the work of administration,\r\n   and if these complications are created in every\r\n   part of the country, the administration will have been brought\r\n   to a deadlock and made none the less impossible, for the\r\n   primary thing is the prestige of the Government and the\r\n   boycott strikes at the root of that prestige.... We\r\n   can reduce every Indian in Government service to the position\r\n   of a man who has fallen from the dignity of Indian citizenship....\r\n   No man shall receive social honours because he is a\r\n   Hakim or a Munsiff or a Huzur Sheristadar.... No law\r\n   can compel one to give a chair to a man who comes to his\r\n   house. He may give it to an ordinary shopkeeper; he may\r\n   refuse it to the Deputy Magistrate or the Subordinate Judge.\r\n   He may give his daughter in marriage to a poor beggar,\r\n   he may refuse her to the son of a Deputy Magistrate, because\r\n   it is absolutely within his rights, absolutely within legal\r\n   bounds.\r\n\r\n   Passive resistance is recognized as legitimate in England.\r\n   It is legitimate in theory even in India, and if it is made\r\n   illegal by new legislation, these laws will infringe on the primary\r\n   rights of personal freedom and will tread on dangerous\r\n   grounds. Therefore it seems to me that by means of the boycott\r\n   we shall be able to do the negative work that will have\r\n   to be done for the attainment of _Swaraj_. Positive work\r\n   will have to be done. Without positive training no self-government\r\n   will come to the boycotter. It will (come)\r\n   through the organization of our village life; of\r\n   our talukas and districts. Let our programme\r\n   include the setting up of machinery for popular administration,\r\n   and running parallel to, but independent of, the existing\r\n   administration of the Government.... In the Providence\r\n   of God we shall then be made rulers over many things.\r\n   This is our programme.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Pal himself admits that even if this programme can be fulfilled,\r\nthis _Swaraj_, this absolute self-rule which he asks for, is\r\nfundamentally incompatible with the maintenance of the British\r\nconnexion.\r\n\r\n   Is really self-government within the Empire a practicable\r\n   ideal? What would it mean? It would mean either no\r\n   real self-government for us or no real overlordship for England.\r\n   Would we be satisfied with the shadow of self-government?\r\n   If not, would England be satisfied with the shadow of overlordship?\r\n   In either case England would not be satisfied\r\n   with a shadowy overlordship, and we refuse to be satisfied\r\n   with a shadowy self-government. And therefore no compromise\r\n   is possible under such conditions between self-government\r\n   in India and the overlordship of England. If self-government\r\n   is conceded to us, what would be England's\r\n   position not only in India, but in the British Empire itself?\r\n   Self-government means the right of self-taxation; it means\r\n   the right of financial control; it means the right of the\r\n   people to impose protective and prohibitive tariffs on foreign\r\n   imports. The moment we have the right of self-taxation,\r\n   what shall we do? We shall not try to be engaged in this\r\n   uphill work of industrial boycott. But we shall do what\r\n   every nation has done. Under the circumstances in which\r\n   we live now, we shall impose a heavy prohibitive protective\r\n   tariff upon every inch of textile fabric from Manchester,\r\n   upon every blade of knife that comes from Leeds. We shall\r\n   refuse to grant admittance to a British soul into our territory.\r\n   We would not allow British capital to be engaged in\r\n   the development of Indian resources, as it is now engaged.\r\n   We would not grant any right to British capitalists to dig\r\n   up the mineral wealth of the land and carry it to their own\r\n   isles. We shall want foreign capital. But we shall apply\r\n   for foreign loans in the open market of the whole world,\r\n   guaranteeing the credit of the Indian Government, the\r\n   Indian nation, for the repayment of the loan, just as America\r\n   has done and is doing, just as Russia is doing now, just as\r\n   Japan has been doing of late. And England's commercial\r\n   interests would not be furthered in the way these are being\r\n   furthered now, under the conditions of popular self-government,\r\n   though it might be within the Empire. But what\r\n   would it mean within the Empire? It would mean that\r\n   England would have to enter into some arrangement with\r\n   us for some preferential tariff. England would have to come\r\n   to our markets on the conditions that we would impose\r\n   upon her for the purpose, if she wanted an open door in\r\n   India, and after a while, when we have developed our resources\r\n   a little and organized our industrial life, we would want the\r\n   open door not only to England, but to every part of the\r\n   British Empire. And do you think it is possible for a small\r\n   country like England with a handful of population, although\r\n   she might be enormously wealthy, to compete on fair and\r\n   equitable terms with a mighty continent like India, with\r\n   immense natural resources, with her teeming populations,\r\n   the soberest and most abstemious populations known to any\r\n   part of the world?\r\n\r\n   If we have really self-government within the Empire, if\r\n   we have the rights of freedom of the Empire as Australia\r\n   has, as Canada has, as England has to-day, if we, 300 millions\r\n   of people, have that freedom of the Empire, the Empire\r\n   would cease to be British. It would be the Indian Empire,\r\n   and the alliance between England and India would be absolutely\r\n   an unequal alliance. That would be, if we had really\r\n   self-government within the Empire, exactly the relation as\r\n   co-partners in a co-British or anti-British Empire of the\r\n   future; and if the day comes when England will be reduced\r\n   to the alternative of having us as an absolutely independent\r\n   people or a co-partner with her in the Empire, she would\r\n   prefer to have us, like the Japanese, as an ally and no longer\r\n   a co-partner, because we are bound to be the predominant\r\n   partner in this Imperial firm. Therefore no sane Englishman,\r\n   politician or publicist can ever contemplate seriously the\r\n   possibility of a self-governing India, like the self-governing\r\n   colonies, forming a vital and organic part of the British\r\n   Empire. Therefore it is that Lord Morley says that so\r\n   long as India remains under the control of Great Britain\r\n   the government of India must continue to be a personal\r\n   and absolute one. Therefore it seems to me that this ideal,\r\n   the practically attainable ideal of self-government within the\r\n   Empire, when we analyse it with care, when we study it in\r\n   the light of common human psychology, when we study\r\n   it in the light of our past experience of the racial characteristics\r\n   of the British people, when we study it in the light of past\r\n   British history in India and other parts of the world, when\r\n   we study and analyse this ideal of self-government within\r\n   the Empire, we find it is a far more impracticable thing to\r\n   attain than even our ideal _Swaraj_.\r\n\r\nI have quoted Mr. Pal's utterances at some length, because they are the\r\nfullest and the most frank exposition available of what lies beneath the\r\nclaim to Colonial self-government as it is understood by \"advanced\"\r\npoliticians. No one can deny the merciless logic with which he analyses\r\nthe inevitable results of _Swaraj_, and Englishmen may well be grateful\r\nto him for having disclosed them so fearlessly. British sympathizers who\r\nare reluctant to look behind a formula which commends itself to their\r\npeculiar predilections, naturally dislike any reference to Mr. Pal's\r\ninterpretation of Indian \"self-government,\" and would even impugn his\r\ncharacter in order the better to question his authority. But they cannot\r\nget over the fact that in India, very few \"moderate\" politicians have\r\nhad the courage openly to repudiate his programmes, though many of them\r\nrealize its dangers, whilst the \"extremists\" want a much shorter cut to\r\nthe same goal. It is only by pledging itself to _Swaraj_ that the Indian\r\nNational Congress has been able to maintain a semblance of unity.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if any doubt still lingers as to the inner meaning of _Swaraj_\r\nand _Swadeshi_, and other kindred war-cries of Indian Nationalism, the\r\nlanguage of the Nationalist Press remains on record to complete our\r\nenlightenment. However incompatible with the maintenance of British rule\r\nmay be the propositions set forth by Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal, they contain\r\nno incitement to violence, no virulent diatribes against Englishmen. It\r\nis in the Press rather than on the platform that Indian politicians,\r\nwhether \"extreme\" or merely \"advanced\" are apt to let themselves go.\r\nThey write down to the level of their larger audiences. So little has\r\nhitherto been done to enlighten public opinion at home as to the gravity\r\nof the evil which the recent Indian Press law has at last, though very\r\ntardily, done something to repress that many Englishmen are still\r\napparently disposed to regard that measure as an oppressive, or at least\r\ndubious, concession to bureaucratic impatience of criticism none the\r\nless healthy for being sometimes excessive.[1] The following quotations,\r\ntaken from vernacular papers before the new Press law was enacted, will\r\nserve to show what Lord Morley meant when he said, \"You may put picric\r\nacid in the ink and the pen just as much as in any steel bomb,\" and\r\nagain, \"It is said that these incendiary articles are 'mere froth.' Yes,\r\nthey are froth, but froth stained with bloodshed.\" Even when they\r\ncontain no definite incitement to murder, no direct exhortation to\r\nrevolt, they will show how systematically, how persistently the wells of\r\nIndian public opinion have been poisoned for years past by those who\r\nclaim to represent the intelligence and enlightenment of modern India.\r\nOnly too graphically also do they illustrate one of the most\r\nunpleasantly characteristic features of the literature of Indian\r\nunrest--namely, its insidious appeals to the Hindu Scriptures and the\r\nHindu deities, and its deliberate vilification of everything English.\r\nCalumny and abuse, combined with a wealth of sacred imagery, supply the\r\nplace of any serious process of reasoning such as is displayed in Mr.\r\nPal's programme with all its uncompromising hostility.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a few specimens of the hatred which animates the\r\nchampions of _Swaraj_--of Indian independence, or, at least, of Colonial\r\nself-government. The _Hind Swarajya_ is nothing if not plain-spoken:--\r\n\r\n   Englishmen! Who are Englishmen? They are the present\r\n   rulers of this country. But how did they become\r\n   our rulers? By throwing the noose of dependence round our\r\n   necks, by making us forget our old learning, by leading us\r\n   along the path of sin, by keeping us ignorant of the use of\r\n   arms.... Oh! my simple countrymen! By their\r\n   teaching adultery has entered our homes, and women have\r\n   begun to be led astray.... Alas! Has India's golden\r\n   land lost all her heroes? Are all eunuchs, timid and afraid,\r\n   forgetful of their duty, preferring to die a slow death of torture,\r\n   silent witnesses of the ruin of their country? Oh!\r\n   Indians, descended from a race of heroes! Why are you afraid\r\n   of Englishmen? They are not gods, but men like yourselves,\r\n   or, rather, monsters who have ravished your Sita-like beauty\r\n   [Sita, the spouse of Rama, was abducted by the demon\r\n   Ravana, and recovered with the help of the Monkey God\r\n   Hanuman and his army of monkeys]. If there be any Rama\r\n   amongst you, let him go forth to bring back your Sita. Raise\r\n   the banner of Swadesh, crying Victory to the Mother! Rescue\r\n   the truth and accomplish the good of India.\r\n\r\nThe Calcutta _Yugantar_ argues that \"sedition has no meaning from the\r\nIndian standpoint.\"\r\n\r\n   If the whole nation is inspired to throw off its yoke and\r\n   become independent, then in the eye of God and the eye of\r\n   Justice whose claim is more reasonable, the Indian's or the\r\n   Englishman's? The Indian has come to see that independence\r\n   is the panacea for all his evils. He will therefore even\r\n   swim in a sea of blood to reach his goal. The British\r\n   dominion over India is a gross myth. It is because the Indian\r\n   holds this myth in his bosom that his sufferings are so great\r\n   to-day. Long ago the Indian Rishis [inspired sages] preached\r\n   the destruction of falsehood and the triumph of truth. And\r\n   this foreign rule based on injustice is a gross falsehood. It\r\n   must be subverted and true _Swadeshi_ rule established. May\r\n   truth be victorious!\r\n\r\nThe _Gujarat_ hails the Hindu New Year which is coming \"to take away the\r\ncurse of the foreigners\":--\r\n\r\n   Oh noble land of the Aryas, thou who wert so great art like\r\n   a caged bird. Are thy powerful sons, Truth and Love, dead?\r\n   Has thy daughter Lakshmi plunged into the sea? or art\r\n   thou overwhelmed with grief because rogues and demons\r\n   have plundered thee? [\"Demons\" is the term usually affected\r\n   by Nationalist journalists when they refer to Englishmen.]\r\n\r\nThe _Shakti_ declares that:--\r\n\r\n   By whatever names--anarchists, extremists, or seditionists\r\n   --those may be called who are taking part in the movement\r\n   for independence, whatever efforts may be made to humiliate\r\n   and to crush them, however many patriots may be sent to\r\n   jail, or into exile, yet the spirit pervading the whole atmosphere\r\n   will never be checked, for the spirit is so strong and spontaneous\r\n   that it must clearly be directed by Divine Providence.\r\n\r\nThe following appears In the _Kal_ (Poona):--\r\n\r\n   We Aryans are no sheep. We have our own country, our\r\n   religion, our heroes, our statesmen, our soldiers. We do\r\n   not owe them to contact with the English. These things\r\n   are not new to us. When the ancestors of those who boast\r\n   to-day of their enterprise and their civilization were in a\r\n   disgusting state of barbarism, or rather centuries before then,\r\n   we were in full possession of all the ennobling qualities of\r\n   head and heart. This holy and hoary land of ours will surely\r\n   regain her position and be once more by her intrinsic lustre\r\n   the home of wealth, arts, and peace. A holy inspiration\r\n   is spreading, that people must sacrifice their lives in the\r\n   cause of what has once been determined to be their duty.\r\n   Heroes are springing up in our midst, though brutal imprisonment\r\n   reduce them to skeletons. Let us devote ourselves\r\n   to the service of the Mother. A man maddened by\r\n   devotion will do everything and anything to achieve his\r\n   ideal. His strength will be adamantine. Just as a widow\r\n   immolates herself on the funeral pyre of her husband, let\r\n   us die for the Mother.\r\n\r\nThe _Dharma_ (Calcutta) emphasizes specially the religious side of the\r\nmovement:--\r\n\r\n   We are engaged in preaching religion and we are putting\r\n   our energy into this agitation, looking on it as the principal\r\n   part of our religion.... The present agitation, in its\r\n   initial stages, had a strong leaven of the spirit of Western\r\n   politics in it, but at present a clear consciousness of Aryan\r\n   greatness and a strong love and reverential spirit towards\r\n   the Motherland have transformed it into a shape in which\r\n   the religious element predominates. Politics is part of religion,\r\n   but it has to be cultivated in an Aryan way, in accordance\r\n   with the precepts of Aryan religion.\r\n\r\nNowhere is the cult of the \"terrible goddess,\" worshipped under many\r\nforms, but chiefly under those of Kali and Durga, more closely\r\nassociated with Indian unrest than in Bengal. Hence the frequency of the\r\nappeals to her in the Bengal Press. The _Dacca Gazette_ welcomes the\r\nfestival of Durga with the following outburst:--\r\n\r\n   Indian brothers! There is no more time for lying asleep.\r\n   Behold, the Mother is coming. Oh Mother, the giver of all\r\n   good! Turn your eyes upon your degraded children. Mother,\r\n   they are now stricken with disease and sorrow. Oh Shyama,\r\n   the reliever of the three kinds of human afflictions, relieve\r\n   our sorrows. Come Mother, the destroyer of the demons,\r\n   and appear at the gates of Bengal.\r\n\r\nThe Barisal _Hitaishi_ refers also to the Durga festival, in which the\r\nweird and often horrible and obscene rites of _Skakti_ worship not\r\ninfrequently play a conspicuous part:--\r\n\r\n   What have we learnt from the _Shakti Puja_? Sooner or\r\n   later this great _Puja_ will yield the desired results. When the\r\n   Hindus realize the true magnificence of the worship of the\r\n   Mother, they will be roused from the slumber of ages, and\r\n   the auspicious dawn of awakenment will light up the horizon.\r\n   You must acquire great power from the worship of the Mother.\r\n   Ganesh, the god who grants success, has his seat assigned\r\n   to him on the left of the great Mother. Why should you\r\n   despair of obtaining success? Look at Kartiki, the god\r\n   who is the chief commander of the armies of the gods, who\r\n   has stationed himself to the right of the Mother; he is\r\n   coming forward with his bow, to assist you against the demons\r\n   of sin, who stand in the way of your accomplishing that great\r\n   object, and as he is up in arms, who can resist?\r\n\r\nThe _Khulnavasi_ breaks out into poetry:--\r\n\r\n   For what sins, O Mother Durga, are thy sons thus dispirited\r\n   and their hearts crushed with injustice? The demons\r\n   are in the ascendant, and constantly triumphing over godliness.\r\n   Awake, Oh Mother, who tramplest on the demons!\r\n   Thy helpless sons, lean for want of food, worn out in the\r\n   struggle with the demons, are, struck with terror at the way\r\n   in which they are being ruled. Famine and plague and\r\n   disease are rife, and unrighteousness triumphs. Awake, Oh\r\n   Goddess Durga! I see the lightning flashing from the\r\n   point of thy bow, the world quaking at thy frowns, and\r\n   creation trembling under thy tread. Let a river of blood\r\n   flow, overwhelming the hearts of the demons.\r\n\r\nThe _Kalyani_ chides the Hindus for breaking their _Swadeshi_ vows to\r\nDurga:--\r\n\r\n   You have made all sorts of vows to stick to Swadeshi,\r\n   but you are still using _bilati_ [foreign] salt, sugar, and\r\n   cloths which are polluted with the blood and fat of animals.\r\n   You swear by the Mother, and then you go and disobey her\r\n   and defile her temples. Do you know that it is owing to your\r\n   sins that Mother Durga has not come to accept your worship\r\n   in Bengal this year? In fact, she is heaving deep sighs of\r\n   sorrow--sighs which will bring a cataclysmic storm upon you.\r\n   If you still care to save your country from utter ruin, mend\r\n   your ways and keep your promises to the Mother.\r\n\r\nIn other provinces where other deities are more popular it is they who\r\nare similarly called in aid. The _Bedari_ of Lahore, for instance,\r\nreproduces from the Puranas the story of the tyrant Rajah Harnakath, who\r\nbrought death on himself at the hands of Vishnu for attempting to kill\r\nhis son Prahlad, whose offence was that he believed in God and\r\nchampioned the cause of justice, in order to liken British statesmen and\r\nAnglo-Indian officials to the wicked Rajah and the Indians to Prahlad.\r\nAs most British statesmen and their representatives abroad are the\r\nenemies of liberty and justice and support slavery and oppression, the\r\nfall of Great Britain is near at hand, and India will then pass into the\r\npossession of her own sons.\r\n\r\nThe _Prem_ of Firozpur is inclined even to give Mr. Keir Hardie a niche\r\nin the Hindu Pantheon. Its editor dreamt he was at a meeting in a free\r\nand contented country. It was attended by some other Indians, and one of\r\nthem recited verses bewailing the condition of India, which was once a\r\nheaven on earth and was now converted into a hell by its foreign rulers,\r\n&c. After prayers had been recited for India, some heavenly beings\r\nappeared, one of whom swore to do his best to relieve the sufferings of\r\nIndians. The editor learnt on inquiry that the dream country was\r\nEngland, the Indian speaker Bepin Chandra Pal, and the heavenly being\r\nMr. Keir Hardie!\r\n\r\nThe _Sahaik_, of Lahore, furnishes an apt illustration of the scurrilous\r\nabuse and calumny which constitute one of the favourite weapons of Hindu\r\nwriters. Referring to the Malaria Conference held last year, it begins\r\nby remarking that when a famine occurs--\r\n\r\n   relief works are opened only when the sufferings of the famine-stricken\r\n   become acute, and their supervision is entrusted\r\n   to a fat-salaried Englishman who swallows up half the collections,\r\n   which amount could have fed hundreds of the poor\r\n   people. Thus also with the forthcoming inquiries concerning\r\n   malarial fever, which is spreading all over the country.\r\n   Every Indian knows that, like the plague, this form of fever\r\n   is due to the poverty and consequent physical weakness\r\n   of the people. It is, however, to the mosquito that the\r\n   authorities went for the causes of the disease, just as to\r\n   the rats for the causes of plague. Different medicines\r\n   and instruments were invented for extirpating the insect,\r\n   doctors were also employed, and rewards paid for the writing\r\n   of books. In this way crores of rupees went into the pockets\r\n   of English shopkeepers and others. A trial is now being\r\n   given to quinine, and lakhs-worth sold to Indians, English\r\n   quinine manufacturers being thus enriched. Again a commission\r\n   is about to sit on the heights of Simla. The commissioners\r\n   will enjoy feasts and dances and drink brandy which\r\n   will cost poor natives lakhs of rupees, and afterwards they\r\n   will devise means to develop the trade in quinine or other\r\n   drugs.\r\n\r\nThe Ranjpur _Vartabaha_ writes that in the local charitable dispensary a\r\nsurgical operation was performed on a patient who died in two hours, and\r\nthat a similar operation on a pregnant woman resulted in her death. It\r\nadds, with delicate sarcasm, that \"the Chief Medical Officer should get\r\nhis salary increased.\" The idea that Englishmen deliberately want to\r\ndepopulate India is one that is sedulously propagated. Thus the _Jhang\r\nSial_ jeers at British \"generosity\" which has \"converted India, one of\r\nthe richest countries in the world, into the land of the starving,\" and\r\nBritish \"wisdom\" for wishing to \"starve out the natives and reign over\r\nempty brick and mortar buildings.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Akash_ (Delhi), referring to the pension granted to the widow of\r\nSir W. Curzon Wyllie, asks whether \"the English can hold up their heads\r\nafter this. Even their widows are fed by India. A nation whose widows\r\nare fed by another should never boast that it is an Imperial and\r\nself-respecting nation.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit another Punjab paper argues ironically from the\r\nspeech of a Mahomedan member of the Punjab Legislative Council in\r\ncondemnation of Dhingra that \"all the white-skinned Europeans, including\r\nthe English rulers of India, must be the lowest born people in the\r\nworld, seeing that they are in the habit of killing natives every day.\"\r\n\r\nNo public servants who venture to discharge their duty loyally fare\r\nworse at the hands of the Nationalist Press than Judges--especially if\r\nthey are Indians. Mr. Justice Davar was the Parsee Judge who sentenced\r\nTilak. The _Kesari_ declared that \"he had already settled the sentence\r\nin his own mind after a careful consideration of external\r\ncircumstances,\" and \"had made himself the laughing-stock of the whole\r\nworld, like the meddlesome monkey in the fable who came to grief in\r\ntrying to pull out the peg 'from a half-sawed beam,'\" Now the _Kesari_\r\nwas Tilak's own paper, and he was convicted on two seditious articles\r\nthat had appeared in its columns, but the _Kal_, another Poona sheet,\r\nalso maintained that everything was done on a prearranged plan. \"There\r\nis no sense in saying that Mr. Tilak was sentenced according to law.\r\nThere was mockery of justice, not justice.\" It added that \"if the Hindus\r\nare to suppose Mr. Tilak guilty because an English Court of Justice had\r\ncondemned him, Christians will have to forswear Christ because He was\r\ncrucified by a Roman Court.\" The _Karnatak Vaibhau_ recalled the story\r\nof the notorious washerman who, by scandalizing Rama, had been\r\nimmortalized in the Ramayana. In the same way the names of Strachey--who\r\nsentenced Tilak at his first trial in 1897--and Davar would be\r\nremembered as long as history endured.\r\n\r\nQuotations could be multiplied _ad infinitum_ and _ad nauseam_ from the\r\nsame papers--I have given only one from each--and from scores of others.\r\nThese will suffice to show what the freedom of the Press stood for in\r\nIndia, in a country where there is an almost superstitious reverence\r\nfor, and faith in, the printed word, where the influence of the Press is\r\nin proportion to the ignorance of the vast majority of its readers, and\r\nwhere, unfortunately the more violent and scurrilous a newspaper\r\nbecomes, the more its popularity grows among the very classes that boast\r\nof their education. They are by no means obscure papers, and some of\r\nthem, such as the _Kal_ the _Hind Swarajya_, and especially the\r\n_Yugantar,_ which became at one time a real power in Bengal, achieved a\r\ncirculation hitherto unknown to the Indian Press. Can any Englishman,\r\nhowever fervent his faith in liberty, regret that some at least of these\r\npapers have now disappeared either as the result of prosecutions under\r\nthe Indian Criminal Code or from the operation of the new Press Law? The\r\nmischief they have done still lives and will not be easily eradicated.\r\nIt is the fashion in certain quarters to reply:--\"But look at the\r\nAnglo-Indian newspapers, at the aggressive and contemptuous tone they\r\nassume towards the natives of India, at the encouragement they\r\nconstantly give to racial hatred.\" Though I am not concerned to deny\r\nthat, in the columns of a few English organs, there may be occasional\r\nlapses from good taste and right feeling, such sweeping charges against\r\nthe Anglo-Indian Press as a whole are absolutely grotesque, and its most\r\nmalevolent critics would be at a loss to quote anything, however\r\nremotely, resembling the exhortations to hatred and violence which have\r\nbeen the stock-in-trade not only of the most popular newspapers in the\r\nvernaculars, but of some even of the leading newspapers published in\r\nEnglish, but edited and owned by Indians.\r\n\r\nEven such extracts as I have given above from vernacular newspapers do\r\nnot by any means represent the lengths to which Indian \"extremism\" can\r\ngo. They represent merely the literature of unrest which has been openly\r\ncirculated in India. There is another and still more poisonous form\r\nwhich is smuggled into India from abroad and surreptitiously circulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA HINDU REVIVAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, when I first visited India, the young Western-educated\r\nHindu was apt to be, at least intellectually, _plus royaliste que le\r\nroi._ he plucked with both hands at the fruits of the tree of Western\r\nknowledge. Some were enthusiastic students of English literature, and\r\nespecially of English poetry. They had their Wordsworth and their\r\nBrowning Societies. Others steeped themselves in English history and\r\nloved to draw their political inspiration from Milton and Burke and John\r\nStuart Mill. Others, again, were the humble disciples of Kant and\r\nSchlegel, of Herbert Spencer and Darwin. But whatever their special\r\ntalent bent might be, the vast majority professed allegiance to Western\r\nideals, and if they had not altogether-and often far too\r\nhastily-abjured, or learned secretly to despise, the beliefs and customs\r\nof their forefathers, they were at any rate anxious to modify and bring\r\nthem into harmony with those of their Western teachers. They may often\r\nhave disliked the Englishman, but they respected and admired him; if\r\nthey resented his frequent assumption of the unqualified superiority,\r\nthey were disposed to admit that it was not without justification. The\r\nenthusiasm kindled in the first half of the last century by the great\r\nmissionaries, like Carey and Duff, who had made distinguished converts\r\namong the highest classes of Hindu society, had begun to wane; but if\r\neducated Hindus had grown more reluctant to accept the dogmas of\r\nChristianity, they were still ready to acknowledge the superiority of\r\nWestern ethics, and the Brahmo Samaj in Bengal, the Prarthana Samaj in\r\nBombay, the Social Reform movement which found eloquent advocates all\r\nover India, and not least in Madras, and other agencies of a similar\r\ncharacter for purging Hindu life of its more barbarous and superstitious\r\nassociations, bore witness to the ascendancy which Western standards of\r\nmorality exercised over the Hindu mind. Keshub Chunder Sen was not\r\nperhaps cast in so fine a mould as Ram Mohan Roy or the more\r\nconservative Dr. Tagore, but his ideals were the same, and his\r\nlife-dream was to find a common denominator for Hinduism and\r\nChristianity which should secure a thorough reform of Hindu society\r\nwithout denationalizing it.\r\n\r\nNor were the milder forms of political activity promoted by the founders\r\nof the Indian National Congress inconsistent with the acceptance of\r\nBritish rule or with the recognition of the great benefits which it has\r\nconferred upon India, and least of all with a genuine admiration for\r\nWestern civilization. For many of them at least the political boons\r\nwhich they craved from their rulers were merely the logical corollaries\r\nof the moral and intellectual as well as of the material boons which\r\nthey had already received. The fierce political agitation of later years\r\ndenies the benefits of British rule and even the superiority of the\r\ncivilization for which it stands. It has invented the legend of a golden\r\nage, when all the virtues flourished and India was a land flowing with\r\nmilk and honey until British lust of conquest brought it to ruin. No\r\ndoubt even to-day there are many eminent Hindus who would still rely\r\nupon the older methods, and who have sufficiently assimilated the\r\neducation they have received at the hands of Englishmen to share\r\nwholeheartedly the faith and pride of the latter in British ideals of\r\nliberty and self-government, and to be honestly convinced that those\r\nideals might be more fully realized in the government of their own\r\ncountry if British administrators would only repose greater confidence\r\nin the natives of India and give them a larger share in the conduct of\r\npublic affairs. But men of this type are now to be found chiefly amongst\r\nthe older generation.\r\n\r\nNo one who has studied, however scantily, the social and religious\r\nsystem which for the sake of convenience we call Hinduism will deny the\r\nloftiness of the philosophic conceptions which underlie even the\r\nextravagances of its creed or the marvellous stability of the complex\r\nfabric based upon its social code. It may seem to us to present in many\r\nof its aspects an almost unthinkable combination of spiritualistic\r\nidealism and of gross materialism, of asceticism and of sensuousness, of\r\nover-weening arrogance when it identifies the human self with the\r\nuniversal self and merges man in the Divinity and the Divinity in man,\r\nand of demoralizing pessimism when it preaches that life itself is but a\r\npainful illusion, and that the sovereign remedy and end of all evils is\r\nnon-existence. Its mythology is often as revolting as the rigidity of\r\nits caste laws, which condemn millions of human beings to such social\r\nabasement that their very touch--the very shadow thrown by their\r\nbody--is held to pollute the privileged mortals who are born into the\r\nhigher castes. Nevertheless, Hinduism has for more than thirty centuries\r\nresponded to the social and religious aspirations of a considerable\r\nfraction of the human race. It represents a great and ancient\r\ncivilization, and that the Hindus should cling to it is not surprising.\r\nNor is it surprising that after the first attraction exerted by the\r\nimpact of an alien civilization equipped with all the panoply of\r\norganized force and scientific achievements had worn off, a certain\r\nreaction should have ensued. In the same way it was inevitable that,\r\nafter the novelty of British rule, of the law and order and security for\r\nlife and property which it had established, had gradually worn away,\r\nthose who had never experienced the evils from which it had freed India\r\nshould begin to chafe under the restraints which it imposed. What is\r\ndisheartening and alarming are the lengths to which this reaction has\r\nbeen carried. For among the younger generation of Hindus there has\r\nunquestionably grown up a deep-seated and bitter hostility not only to\r\nBritish rule and to British methods of administration, but to all the\r\ninfluences of Western civilization, and the rehabilitation of Hindu\r\ncustoms and beliefs has proceeded _pari passu_ with the growth of\r\npolitical disaffection.\r\n\r\nPractices which an educated Hindu would have been at pains to explain\r\naway, if he had not frankly repudiated them thirty years ago, now find\r\nzealous apologists. Polytheism is not merely extolled as the poetic\r\nexpression of eternal verities, but the gods and goddesses of the Hindu\r\npantheon are being invested with fresh sanctity. The Brahmo Saniaj is\r\nstill a great influence for good, but it appears to be gradually losing\r\nvitality, and though its literary output is still considerable, its\r\nmembership is shrinking. The Prarthana Samaj is moribund. The fashion of\r\nthe day is for religious \"revivals,\" in which the worship of Kali, the\r\nsanguinary goddess of destruction, or the cult of Shivaji-Maharaj, the\r\nMahratta chieftain who humbled in his day the pride of the alien\r\nconquerors of Hindustan, plays an appropriately conspicuous part. The\r\nArya-Samaj, which is spreading all over the Punjab and in the United\r\nProvinces, represents in one of its aspects a revolt against Hindu\r\northodoxy, but in another it represents equally a revolt against Western\r\nideals, for in the teachings of its founder, Dayanand, it has found an\r\naggressive gospel which bases the claims of Aryan, _i.e._, Hindu,\r\nsupremacy on the Vedas as the one ultimate source of human and Divine\r\nwisdom. The exalted character of Vedantic philosophy has been as widely\r\nrecognized among European students as the subtle beauty of many of the\r\nUpanishads, in which the cryptic teachings of the Vedas have been\r\ndeveloped along different and often conflicting lines of thought to\r\nsuit the eclecticism of the Hindu mind. But the Arya-Samaj has not been\r\ncontent to assert the ethical perfection of the Vedas. In its zeal to\r\nproclaim the immanent superiority of Aryan civilization--it repudiates\r\nthe term Hindu as savouring of an alien origin--over Western\r\ncivilization, it claims to have discovered in the Vedas the germs of all\r\nthe discoveries of modern science, even to wireless telegraphy and\r\naeroplanes.\r\n\r\nJust as the political agitation in India has derived invaluable\r\nencouragement from a handful of British members of Parliament and other\r\nsympathizers in Europe and America, so this Hindu revival has been\r\nlargely stimulated and to some extent prompted by Europeans and\r\nAmericans. Not only the writings of English and German scholars, like\r\nMax Müller and Deutsch, helped enormously to revive the interest of\r\neducated Hindus in their ancient literature and earlier forms of\r\nreligion, but it was in the polemical tracts of European writers that\r\nthe first protagonists of Hindu reaction against Christian influences\r\nfound their readiest weapons of attack. The campaign was started in 1887\r\nby the Hindu Tract Society of Madras, which set itself first to inflame\r\npopular fanaticism against the missionaries, who, especially in the\r\nsouth of India, had been the pioneers of Western education. Bradlaugh's\r\ntext-books and the pamphlets of many lesser writers belonging to the\r\nsame school of thought were eagerly translated into the vernacular, and\r\nthose that achieved the greatest popularity were books like \"The Evil of\r\nContinence,\" in which not only Christian theology, but Christian\r\nmorality was held up to scorn and ridicule. The advent of the\r\ntheosophists, heralded by Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, gave a\r\nfresh impetus to the revival, and certainly no Hindu has done so much to\r\norganize and consolidate the movement as Mrs. Annie Besant, who, in her\r\nCentral Hindu College at Benares and her Theosophical Institution at\r\nAdyar, near Madras, has openly proclaimed her faith in the superiority\r\nof the whole Hindu system to the vaunted civilization of the West. Is it\r\nsurprising that Hindus should turn their backs upon our civilization[2]\r\nwhen a European of highly-trained intellectual power and with an\r\nextraordinary gift of eloquence comes and tells them that it is they who\r\npossess and have from all times possessed the key to supreme wisdom;\r\nthat their gods, their philosophy, their morality are on a higher plane\r\nof thought than the West has ever reached? Is it surprising that with\r\nsuch encouragement Hinduism should no longer remain on the defensive,\r\nbut, discarding in this respect all its own traditions as a\r\nnon-proselytizing creed, should send out missionaries to preach the\r\nmessage of Hindu enlightenment to those still groping in the darkness of\r\nthe West? The mission of Swami Vivekananda to the Chicago Congress of\r\nReligions is in itself one of the most striking incidents in the history\r\nof Hindu revivalism, but it is perhaps less wonderful than the triumph\r\nhe achieved when he returned to India accompanied by a chosen band of\r\neager disciples from the West.\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, endless forms to this revival of Hinduism--as endless\r\nas to Hinduism itself--but what it is perhaps most important for us to\r\nnote is that, wherever political agitation assumes the most virulent\r\ncharacter, there the Hindu revival also assumes the most extravagant\r\nshapes. Secret societies place their murderous activities under the\r\nspecial patronage of one or other of the chief popular deities. Their\r\nvows are taken \"on the sacred water of the Ganges,\" or \"holding the\r\nsacred Tulsi plant,\" or \"in the presence of Mahadevi\"--the great\r\ngoddess who delights in bloody sacrifices, Charms and amulets,\r\nincantations and imprecations, play an important part in the ceremonies\r\nof initiation. In some quarters there has been some recrudescence of\r\nthe _Shakti_ cultus, with its often obscene and horrible rites, and the\r\nunnatural depravity which was so marked a feature in the case of the\r\nband of young Brahmans who conspired to murder Mr. Jackson at Nasik\r\nrepresents a form of erotomania which is certainly much more common\r\namongst Hindu political fanatics than amongst Hindus in general.\r\n\r\nBy no means all, however, are of this degenerate type, and the _Bhagvat\r\nGita_ has been impressed into the service of sedition by men who would\r\nhave been as incapable of dabbling in political as in any other form of\r\ncrime, had they not been able to invest it with a religious sanction.\r\nThere is no more beautiful book in the sacred literature of the Hindus;\r\nthere is none in which the more enlightened find greater spiritual\r\ncomfort; yet it is in the _Bhagvat Gita_ that, by a strange perversion,\r\nthe Hindu conspirator has sought and claims to have found texts that\r\njustify murder as a divinely inspired deed when it is committed in the\r\nsacred cause of Hinduism. Nor is it only the extremists who appeal in\r\nthis fashion to Hindu religious emotionalism. It is often just as\r\ndifficult to appraise the subtle differences which separate the\r\n\"moderate\" from the \"advanced\" politician and the \"advanced\" politician\r\nfrom the extremist as it is to distinguish between the various forms and\r\ngradations of the Hindu revival in its religious and social aspects. But\r\nit was in the courtyard of the great temple of Kali at Calcutta in the\r\npresence of \"the terrible goddess\" that the \"leaders of the Bengali\r\nnation,\" men who, like Mr. Surendranath Banerjee, have always professed\r\nto be \"moderates,\" held their chief demonstrations against \"partition\"\r\nand administered the _Swadeshi_ oath to their followers. Equally\r\nnoteworthy is the part played by the revival of Ganpati celebrations in\r\nhonour of Ganesh, the elephant-headed god, perhaps the most popular of\r\nall Hindu deities, in stimulating political disaffection in the Deccan.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with this campaign for the glorification of Hinduism at the\r\nexpense of Western civilization there has been carried on another and\r\nfar more invidious campaign for the vilification of everything British.\r\nThe individual Englishman is denounced as a bloodsucker and a tyrant;\r\nhis personal integrity is impugned and derided; his methods of\r\nadministration are alleged to be wilfully directed to the\r\nimpoverishment, and even to the depopulation, of India; his social\r\ncustoms are traduced as depraved and corrupt; even his women-folk are\r\naccused of common wantonness. This systematized form of personal calumny\r\nis a scarcely less significant feature of the literature of Indian\r\nunrest than its appeals to the Hindu scriptures and to the Hindu deities\r\nand its exploitation of the religious sentiment for the promotion of\r\nracial hatred. _Swadeshi_ and _Swaraj_ are the battle-cries of this new\r\nHindu \"nationalism,\" but they mean far more than a mere claim to fiscal\r\nor even political independence. They mean an organized uplifting of the\r\nold Hindu traditions, social and religious, intellectual and moral,\r\nagainst the imported ideals of an alien race and an alien civilization,\r\nand the sincerity of some, at least, of the apostles of this new creed\r\ncannot be questioned. With Mr. Arabindo Ghose, they firmly believe that\r\n\"the whole moral strength of the country is with us, justice is with us,\r\nnature is with us, and the law of God, which is higher than any human\r\nlaw, justifies our action.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a grave phenomenon not to be contemptuously dismissed as the\r\nfolly of ill-digested knowledge or summarily judged and condemned, in a\r\nspirit of self-righteousness, as an additional proof of the innate\r\ndepravity and ingratitude of the East. It undoubtedly represents a deep\r\nstirring of the waters amongst a people endowed with no mean gifts of\r\nhead and heart, and if it has thrown up much scum, it affords glimpses\r\nof nobler elements which time may purify and bring to the surface. Nor\r\nif our rule and our civilization are to prevail must we be unmindful of\r\nour own responsibility or forget that our presence and the influences we\r\nbrought with us first stirred the waters.\r\n\r\nThe part played by Brahmanism in Indian unrest is far more conspicuous\r\nin some parts of India than in others, and for reasons which are\r\ngenerally not far to seek. Wherever it has been most active, it connotes\r\nperhaps more than anything else the reactionary side of that unrest.\r\nThough there have been and still are many enlightened Brahmans who have\r\ncordially responded to the best influences of Western education, and\r\nhave worked with admirable zeal and courage to bridge the gulf between\r\nIndian and European civilization, Brahmanism as a system represents the\r\nantipodes of all that British rule must stand for in India, and\r\nBrahmanism has from times immemorial dominated Hindu society--dominated\r\nit, according to the Hindu Nationalists, for its salvation. \"If,\" writes\r\none of them, \"Mother India, though reduced to a mere skeleton by the\r\noppression of alien rulers during hundreds of years, still preserves her\r\nvitality, it is because the Brahmans have never relaxed in their\r\ndevotion to her. She has witnessed political and social revolutions.\r\nFamines and pestilence have shorn her of her splendour. But the Brahmans\r\nhave stood by her through all the vicissitudes of fortune. It is they\r\nwho raised her to the highest pinnacle of glory, and it is they whose\r\nministrations still keep up the drooping spirits of her children.\"\r\n\r\nThe Brahmans are the sacerdotal caste of India. They are at the same\r\ntime the proudest and the closest aristocracy that the world has ever\r\nseen, for they form not merely an aristocracy of birth in the strictest\r\nsense of the term, but one of divine origin. Of the Brahman it may be\r\nsaid as of no other privileged mortal except perhaps the Levite of the\r\nOld Testament: _Nascitur non fit_. No king, however powerful, can make\r\nor unmake a Brahman, no genius, however transcendent, no services,\r\nhowever conspicuous, no virtues, however pre-eminent, can avail to raise\r\na Hindu from a lower caste to the Brahman's estate. In early times the\r\ncaste laws must have been less rigid, for otherwise there would only be\r\nAryan Brahmans, whereas in the South of India there are many Brahmans\r\nof obviously Dravidian stock. But to-day not even the Brahmans\r\nthemselves can raise to their own equal one who is not born of their\r\ncaste, though by the exercise of the castely authority they can in\r\nspecific cases outcaste a fellow-Brahman who has offended against the\r\nimmutable laws of caste, and, except for minor transgressions which\r\nallow of atonement and reinstatement, when once outcasted he and his\r\ndescendants cease for ever to be Brahmans. The Brahmans might be at a\r\nloss to make good their claim that they date back to the remote ages of\r\nthe Vedas. But a good deal more than two thousand years have passed\r\nsince they constituted themselves the only authorized intermediaries\r\nbetween mankind and the gods. In them became vested the monopoly of the\r\nancient language in which all religious rites are performed, and with a\r\nmonopoly of the knowledge of Sanskrit they retained a monopoly of\r\nlearning long after Sanskrit itself had become a dead language. Like the\r\npriests who wielded a Latin pen in the Middle Ages in Europe, they sat\r\nas advisers and conscience-keepers in the councils of every Hindu ruler.\r\nTo the present day they alone can expound the Hindu scriptures, they\r\nalone can approach the gods in their temples, they alone can minister to\r\nthe spiritual needs of such of the lower castes as are credited with\r\nsufficient human dignity to be in any way worthy of their ministrations.\r\n\r\nIn the course of ages differences and distinctions have gradually grown\r\nup amongst them, and they have split up into innumerable septs and\r\nsub-castes. As they multiplied from generation to generation an\r\nincreasing proportion were compelled to supplement the avocations\r\noriginally sacred to their caste by other and lowlier means of\r\nlivelihood. There are to-day over 14 million Brahmans in India, and a\r\nvery large majority of them have been compelled to adopt agricultural,\r\nmilitary, and mercantile pursuits which, as we know from the Code of\r\nManu were already regarded as, in certain circumstances, legitimate or\r\nexcusable for a Brahman even in the days of that ancient law-giver. In\r\nregard to all other castes, however, the Brahman, humble as his worldly\r\n_status_ may be, retains an undisputed pre-eminence which he never\r\nforgets or allows to be forgotten, though it may only be a pale\r\nreflection of the prestige and authority of his more exalted\r\ncaste-men--a prestige and authority, be it added, which have often been\r\njustified by individual achievements. How far the influence of\r\nBrahmanism as a system has been socially a good or an evil influence I\r\nam not concerned to discuss, but, however antagonistic it may be at the\r\npresent moment to the influence of Western civilization, it would be\r\nunfair to deny that it has shown itself and still shows itself capable\r\nof producing a very high type both of intellect and of character. Nor\r\ncould it otherwise have survived as it has the vicissitudes of\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nNeither the triumph of Buddhism, which lasted for nearly 500 years, nor\r\nsuccessive waves of Mahomedan conquest availed to destroy the power of\r\nBrahmanism, nor has it been broken by British supremacy. Inflexibly as\r\nhe dominates a social system in all essentials more rigid than any\r\nother, the Brahman has not only recognised the need of a certain\r\nplasticity in its construction which allows for constant expansion, but\r\nhe has himself shown unfailing adaptability in all non-essentials to\r\nvarying circumstances. To the requirements of their new Western masters\r\nthe Brahmans adapted themselves from the first with admirable\r\nsuppleness, and when a Western system of education was introduced into\r\nIndia in the first half of the last century, they were quicker than any\r\nother class to realize how it could be used to fortify their own\r\nposition. The main original object of the introduction of Western\r\neducation into India was the training of a sufficient number of young\r\nIndians to fill the subordinate posts in the public offices with\r\nEnglish-speaking natives. The Brahmans responded freely to the call, and\r\nthey soon acquired almost the same monopoly of the new Western learning\r\nas they had enjoyed of Hindu lore through the centuries. With the\r\ndevelopment of the great administrative services, with the substitution\r\nof English for the vernacular tongues as the only official language,\r\nwith the remodelling of judicial administration and procedure on British\r\nlines, with the growth of the liberal professions and of the Press,\r\ntheir influence constantly found new fields of activity, whilst through\r\nthe old traditional channels it continued to permeate those strata of\r\nHindu society with which the West had established little or no contact.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the spread of Western ideas and habits was bound to loosen\r\nto some extent the Brahmans' hold upon Hindu society, for that hold is\r\nchiefly rooted in the immemorial sanctity of custom, which new habits\r\nand methods imported from the West necessarily tended to undermine.\r\nScrupulous--and, according to many earnest Englishmen, over-scrupulous--as\r\nwe were to respect religious beliefs and prejudices, the influence of\r\nWestern civilization could not fail to clash directly or indirectly with\r\nmany of the ordinances of Hindu orthodoxy. In non-essentials Brahmanism\r\nsoon found it expedient to relax the rigour of caste obligations, as for\r\ninstance to meet the hard case of young Hindus who could not travel across\r\nthe \"black water\" to Europe for their studies without breaking caste, or\r\nindeed travel even in their own country in railways and river steamers\r\nwithout incurring the pollution of bodily contact with the \"untouchable\"\r\ncastes. Penances were at first imposed which had gradually to be lightened\r\nuntil they came to be merely nominal. Graver issues were raised when such\r\nancient customs as infant  marriage and the degradation of child widows\r\nwere challenged. The ferment of new ideas was spreading amongst the\r\nBrahmans themselves. Some had openly discarded their ancestral faith, and\r\nmany more were moved to search their own scriptures for some interpretation\r\nof the law less inconsistent with Western standards. It seemed at one\r\nmoment as if, under the inspiration of men like Ranade in the Deccan and\r\nTagore in Bengal, Brahmanism itself was about to take the lead in purging\r\nHinduism of its most baneful superstitions and bringing it into line with\r\nthe philosophy and ethics of the West. But the liberal movement failed to\r\nprevail against the forces of popular superstition and orthodox bigotry,\r\ncombined with the bitterness too frequently resulting from the failure\r\nof Western education to secure material success or even an adequate\r\nlivelihood for those who had departed from the old ways. Though there\r\nhave been and still are many admirable exceptions, Brahmanism remained\r\nthe stronghold of reaction against the Western invasion. Of recent\r\nyears, educated Brahmans have figured prominently in the social and\r\nreligious revival of Hinduism, and they have figured no less\r\nprominently, whether in the ranks of the extremists or amongst the\r\nmoderate and advanced politicians, in the political movement which has\r\naccompanied that revival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nBRAHMANISM AND DISAFFECTION IN THE DECCAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFundamental as is the antagonism between the civilization represented by\r\nthe British _Raj_ and the essential spirit of Brahmanism. It is not, of\r\ncourse, always or everywhere equally acute, for there is no more\r\nuniformity about Brahmanism than about any other Indian growth. But in\r\nthe Deccan Brahmanism has remained more fiercely militant than in any\r\nother part of India, chiefly perhaps because nowhere had it wielded such\r\nabsolute power within times which may still be called recent. Far into\r\nthe eighteenth century Poona had been the capital of a theocratic State\r\nin which behind the throne of the Peshwas both spiritual and secular\r\nauthority were concentrated in the hands of the Brahmans. Such memories\r\nare slow to die and least of all in an ancient and conservative country\r\nlike India, and there was one sept of Brahmans, at any rate, who were\r\ndetermined not to let them die.\r\n\r\nThe Chitpavan Brahmans are undoubtedly the most powerful and the most\r\nable of all the Brahmans of the Deccan. A curious legend ascribes their\r\norigin to the miraculous intervention of Parashurama, the sixth Avatar\r\nof the god Vishnu, who finding no Brahmans to release him by the\r\naccustomed ritual from the defilement of his earthly labours, dragged on\r\nto shore the bodies of fourteen barbarians that he had found washed up\r\nfrom the ocean, burnt them on a funeral pyre and then breathed life and\r\nBrahmanhood into their ashes. On these new made Brahmans he conferred\r\nthe name Chitpavan, which means \"purified by fire,\" and all the land of\r\nthe Konkan from which, by a bolt from his arrow, he caused the sea for\r\never to recede. Every Chitpavan to-day claims descent from one or other\r\nof the fourteen divinely Brahmanized barbarians, whom some believe to\r\nhave been hardy Norsemen driven in their long ships on to the sandy\r\nshores of what is now the Bombay Presidency. At any rate, as has been\r\nwell said of them, Western daring and Eastern craft look out alike from\r\nthe alert features and clear parchment skin and through the strange\r\nstone-grey eyes of the Chitpavan. It was not, however, till about two\r\ncenturies ago that the Chitpavan Brahmans began to play a conspicuous\r\npart in Indian history, when one of this sept, Balaji Vishvanath Rao,\r\nworked his way up at the Court of the Mahratta King Shahu to the\r\nposition of Peshwa, or Prime Minister, which he succeeded even in\r\nbequeathing to his son, the great Bajirao Balaji, who led the Mahratta\r\narmies right up to the walls of Delhi. Bajirao's son not only succeeded\r\nas Balaji II., but on the death of King Shahu disposed of his Royal\r\nmaster's family by a bold Palace conspiracy and openly assumed sovereign\r\npowers. The crushing defeat of Panipat brought him to his grave, and\r\nthough the dynasty was still continued, and regained some of its lustre\r\nunder Madhao Rao I., the Peshwas subsequently became little more than\r\n_rois fainéants_ in the hands of their Ministers, and especially in\r\nthose of the great Regent Nana Phadnavis. He, too, was a Chitpavan\r\nBrahman, and it was under his reign that his fellow caste-men acquired\r\nso complete a monopoly of all the chief offices of State that the\r\nMahratta Empire became essentially a Chitpavan Empire. The British arms\r\nultimately defeated the dreams of universal dominion which, in the then\r\ncondition of India, the Chitpavans might well have hoped to establish\r\non the ruins of the great Moghul Empire. But British rule did not\r\ndestroy their power. They were quick to adapt themselves to new\r\nconditions and above all to avail themselves of the advantages of\r\nWestern education. Their great administrative abilities compelled\r\nrecognition, and Chitpavans swarm to-day in every Government office of\r\nthe Deccan as they did in the days of Nana Phadnavis. They sit on the\r\nBench, they dominate the Bar, they teach in the schools, they control\r\nthe vernacular Press, they have furnished almost all the most\r\nconspicuous names in the modern literature and drama of Western India as\r\nwell as in politics. Of the higher appointments held by natives in the\r\nPresidency of Bombay, the last census tells us that the Hindus held 266\r\nagainst 86 held by Parsees and 23 held by Mahomedans, and that out of\r\nthose held by the Hindus, more than 72 per cent. were held by Brahmans,\r\nthough the Brahmans form less than one-fourteenth of the total Hindu\r\npopulation of the province. All Brahmans are not, of course, Chitpavans,\r\nbut the Chitpavans supply an overwhelming majority of those Government\r\nofficials, and their ascendency over every other Brahman sept in\r\nMaharashtra is undisputed. From the Deccan, moreover, their influence\r\nhas spread practically all over India and, especially, in the native\r\nStates, which have recruited amongst the Chitpavans some of their ablest\r\npublic servants. Amongst Chitpavans are to be found many of the most\r\nenlightened and progressive Indians of our times and many have served\r\nthe British _Raj_ with unquestioned loyalty and integrity. But amongst\r\nmany others--perhaps indeed amongst the great majority--there has\r\nundoubtedly been preserved for the last hundred years from the time of\r\nthe downfall of the Peshwa dominion to the present day, an unbroken\r\ntradition of hatred towards British rule, an undying hope that it might\r\nsome day be subverted and their own ascendency restored. Not to go back\r\nto the exploits of Nana Sahib, himself a Chitpavan, and his followers\r\nduring the Mutiny, or to the Ramoshi rebellion round Poona in 1879, it\r\nwas in Poona that the native Press, mainly conducted by Brahmans, first\r\nassumed that tone of virulent hostility towards British rule and British\r\nrulers which led to the Press Act of 1879, and some of the worst\r\nextracts quoted at that time by the Government of India in support of\r\nthat measure were taken from Poona newspapers. It was in Poona that some\r\nyears later the assassination of two English officials by a young\r\nChitpavan Brahman was the first outcome of a fresh campaign, leading\r\ndirectly to political murder. It was by another Chitpavan Brahman that\r\nMr. Jackson was murdered last December at Nasik; his accomplices were\r\nwith one exception Chitpavan Brahmans, and to the same sept of Brahmans\r\nbelong nearly all the defendants in the great conspiracy trial now\r\nproceeding at Bombay.\r\n\r\nBut if there were already, more than 20 years ago, wild and\r\nirreconcilable spirits bent on fomenting disaffection, there were\r\namongst the Deccanee Brahmans themselves a small intellectual _élite_\r\nwho, though by no means servile apologists of British rule, fully\r\nrealized that their primary duty was not to stir up popular passion\r\nagainst alien rulers, but to bring Hindu society into closer communion\r\nwith the higher civilization which those rulers, whatever their\r\nshortcomings, undoubtedly represented. Conspicuous amongst such men was\r\nMahadev Govind Ranade. Equally conspicuous in the opposite camp was a\r\nman of a very different stamp, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who was destined to\r\nbecome one of the most dangerous pioneers of disaffection. It was a\r\nHindu gentleman and a Brahman who told me that if I wanted to study the\r\npsychology of Indian unrest I should begin by studying Tilak's career.\r\n\"Tilak's onslaught in Poona upon Ranade, his alliance with the bigots of\r\northodoxy, his appeals to popular superstition in the new Ganpati\r\ncelebrations, to racial fanaticism in the 'Anti-Cow-killing Movement,'\r\nto Mahratta sentiment in the cult which he introduced of Shivaji, his\r\nactive propaganda amongst schoolboys and students, his gymnastic\r\nsocieties, his preaching in favour of physical training, and last but\r\nnot least his control of the Press and the note of personal violence\r\nwhich he imparted to newspaper polemics, represent the progressive\r\nstages of a highly-organized campaign which has served as a model to the\r\napostles of unrest all over India.\" This was a valuable piece of advice,\r\nfor, if any one can claim to be truly the father of Indian unrest, it is\r\nBal Gangadhar Tilak. The story of his initial campaign in the Deccan,\r\nthough it dates back to the closing decades of the last century, is\r\nstill well worth studying, and has, in fact, never received adequate\r\nattention, for on the one hand it pricks the shallow view that Indian\r\nunrest is merely an echo of the Japanese victories in Manchuria, and, on\r\nthe other hand, it illustrates clearly the close connexion that exists\r\nbetween the forces of Indian political disaffection and those of social\r\nand religious reaction, whilst the methods which he employed and the\r\nresults which attended his activity have been reproduced with singular\r\nfidelity in subsequent phases of the movement.\r\n\r\nWhen Tilak entered upon public life in the early eighties, the Brahmans\r\nof the Deccan were divided into two camps, one of which, headed at first\r\nby the late Mr. Justice Ranade, consisted of a small intellectual\r\n_élite_, who held, without forgoing their right to criticize British\r\nadministrators or to promote political reforms by constitutional\r\nmethods, that Indians of all creeds, including the Hindus, should begin\r\nby reforming their own social institutions, and bring them into greater\r\nharmony with Western standards. Tilak, a Chitpavan Brahman of\r\nconsiderable erudition, who had graduated with honours at Bombay, had,\r\nhowever, inherited his full share of Chitpavan hostility to British\r\nascendency. He was also by temperament and ambition impatient of all\r\nrestraint, and jealous of the commanding authority which a man like\r\nRanade owed quite as much to the nobility of his character as to his\r\nsocial position and force of intellect. In opposition to Ranade, with\r\nwhom he had at first co-operated as an educationist, Tilak drifted\r\nrapidly into the reactionary camp. The battle was first engaged over the\r\ncontrol of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha and the Education Society, two\r\nprogressive associations which, though mainly composed of Brahmans,\r\nincluded a sprinkling of Mahomedans and of non-Brahman Hindus. Tilak had\r\nthrown himself into journalism, and after the repeal of the Indian Press\r\nLaw on the return of a Liberal Administration to office at home in 1881,\r\nhe had been amongst the first to revive the incendiary methods which it\r\nhad temporarily and very successfully checked. His first onslaught upon\r\nRanade's position, however, failed, and instead of supplanting him, it\r\nwas he who was compelled in 1890 to sever his connexion with the\r\nEducation Society.\r\n\r\nTilak's defeat was short lived. The introduction of the Age of Consent\r\nBill, in 1890, to mitigate the evils of Hindu child-marriage, gave him a\r\nfresh opening. Ranade, discouraged and alarmed by the violence of the\r\nTilak party, had by this time retired from the forefront of the fray,\r\nbut in Dr. Bhandarkar, Mr. Justice Tilang, Mr. A.K. Nulkar, Mr. (now Sir\r\nN.G.) Chandavarkar, and other courageous Hindu reformers, with whom Mr.\r\nGokhale was always ready to co-operate against the forces of religious\r\nsuperstition, he had left disciples ready to carry on the good fight.\r\nTilak raised against them a storm of passion and prejudice. In the\r\ncolumns of the _Kesari_, of which he had become sole proprietor, he\r\ndenounced every Hindu who supported the measure as a renegade and a\r\ntraitor to the cause of Hinduism, and thus won the support of\r\nconservative orthodoxy, which had hitherto viewed with alarm some of his\r\nliterary excursions into the field of Vedantic exegesis. With the help\r\nof the brothers Natu, who were the recognized leaders of Hindu\r\northodoxy, he carried his propaganda into the schools and colleges in\r\nthe teeth of the Moderate party, and, proclaiming that unless they\r\nlearnt to employ force the Hindus must expect to be impotent witnesses\r\nof the gradual downfall of all their ancient institutions, he proceeded\r\nto organize gymnastic societies in which physical training and the use\r\nof more or less primitive weapons were taught in order to develop the\r\nmartial instincts of the rising generation.\r\n\r\nIf amongst many Brahmans of Maharashtra hatred of the British is the\r\ndominant passion, amongst the Mahratta population at large whatever\r\nthere is of racial and religious jealousy is mainly directed against the\r\nMahomedans. This is partly, no doubt, a legacy of the old days of\r\nMahomedan supremacy. In 1893 some riots in Bombay of a more severe\r\ncharacter than usual gave Tilak an opportunity of broadening the new\r\nmovement by enlisting in its support the old anti-Mahomedan feeling of\r\nthe people. He not only convoked popular meetings in which his fiery\r\neloquence denounced the Mahomedans as the sworn foes of Hinduism, but he\r\nstarted an organization known as the \"Anti-Cow-Killing Society,\" which\r\nwas intended and regarded as a direct provocation to the Mahomedans,\r\nwho, like ourselves, think it no sacrilege to eat beef. In vain did\r\nliberal Hindus appeal to him to desist from these inflammatory methods.\r\nTheir appeals had no effect upon him, and merely served his purpose by\r\nundermining the little authority they still possessed. Government had\r\nforbidden Hindu processions to play music whilst passing in front of\r\nMahomedan mosques, as this was a fertile cause of riotous affrays. Tilak\r\nnot only himself protested against this \"interference with the liberties\r\nof the people,\" but insisted that the Sarvajanik Sabha should identify\r\nitself with the \"national\" cause and memorialize Government for the\r\nremoval of a prohibition so offensive to Hindu sentiment. The Moderates\r\nhesitated, but were overawed by popular clamour and the threats of the\r\nTilak Press. The Mahomedans and a few other members repudiated the\r\nmemorial and resigned. Tilak, though not yet in absolute control of the\r\nSabha, became already practically its master. No one knew better than he\r\nhow to compel submission by packed meetings and organized rowdyism.\r\n\r\nTilak's propaganda had at the same time steadily assumed a more and more\r\nanti-British character, and it was always as the allies and the tools of\r\nGovernment, in its machinations against Hinduism, that the Hindu\r\nreformers and the Mahomedans had in turn been denounced. In order to\r\ninvest it with a more definitely religious sanction, Tilak placed it\r\nunder the special patronage of the most popular deity in India. Though\r\nGanesh, the elephant-headed god, is the god of learning whom Hindu\r\nwriters delight to invoke on the title-page of their books, there is\r\nscarcely a village or a frequented roadside in India that does not show\r\nsome rude presentment of his familiar features, usually smeared over\r\nwith red ochre, Tilak could not have devised a more popular move than\r\nwhen he set himself to organize annual festivals in honour of Ganesh,\r\nknown as Ganpati celebrations, and to found in all the chief centres of\r\nthe Deccan Ganpati societies, each with its _mela_ or choir recruited\r\namong his youthful bands of gymnasts. These festivals gave occasion for\r\ntheatrical performances[3] and religious songs in which the legends of\r\nHindu mythology were skilfully exploited to stir up hatred of the\r\n\"foreigner\"--and _mlenccha_, the term employed for \"foreigner,\" applied\r\nequally to Europeans and to Mahomedans--as well as for tumultuous\r\nprocessions only too well calculated to provoke affrays with the\r\nMahomedans and with the police, which in turn led to judicial\r\nproceedings that served as a fresh excuse for noisy protests and\r\ninflammatory pleadings. With the Ganpati celebrations the area of\r\nTilak's propaganda was widely increased.\r\n\r\nBut the movement had yet to be given a form which should directly appeal\r\nto the fighting instincts of the Mahrattas and stimulate active\r\ndisaffection by reviving memories of olden times when under Shivaji's\r\nleadership they had rolled back the tide of Musulman conquest and\r\ncreated a Mahratta Empire of their own. The legends of Shivaji's prowess\r\nstill lingered in Maharashtra, where the battlemented strongholds which\r\nhe built crown many a precipitous crag of the Deccan highlands. In a\r\nvalley below Pratabghar the spot is still shown where Shivaji induced\r\nthe Mahomedan general, Afzul Khan, to meet him in peaceful conference\r\nhalf-way between the contending armies, and, as he bent down to greet\r\nhis guest, plunged into his bowels the famous \"tiger's claw,\" a hooked\r\ngauntlet of steel, while the Mahratta forces sprang out of ambush and\r\ncut the Mahomedan army to pieces. But if Shivaji's memory still lived,\r\nit belonged to a past which was practically dead and gone. Only a few\r\nyears, before an Englishman who had visited Shivaji's tomb had written\r\nto a local newspaper calling attention to the ruinous condition into\r\nwhich the people of Maharashtra had allowed the last resting-place of\r\ntheir national hero to fall. Some say it was this letter which first\r\ninspired Tilak with the idea of reviving Shivaji's memory and converting\r\nit into a living force. Originally it was upon the great days of the\r\nPoona Peshwas that Tilak had laid the chief stress, and he may possibly\r\nhave discovered that theirs were not after all names to conjure with\r\namongst non-Brahman Mahrattas, who had suffered heavily enough at their\r\nhands. At any rate, Tilak brought Shivaji to the forefront and set in\r\nmotion a great \"national\" propaganda which culminated in 1895 in the\r\ncelebration at all the chief centres of Brahman activity in the Deccan\r\nof Shivaji's reputed birthday, the principal commemoration being held\r\nunder Tilak's own presidency at Raighar, where the Mahratta chieftain\r\nhad himself been crowned. What was the purpose and significance of this\r\nmovement may be gathered from a _Shlok_ or sacred poem improvised on\r\nthis occasion by one of Tilak's disciples who to acquire sinister\r\nnotoriety.\r\n\r\n   Let us be prompt like Shivaji to engage in desperate enterprises.\r\n   Take up your swords and shields and we shall cut\r\n   off countless heads of enemies. Listen! Though we shall\r\n   have to risk our lives in a national war, we shall assuredly\r\n   shed the life-blood of our enemies.\r\n\r\nIt was on the occasion of the Shivaji \"coronation festivities\" that the\r\nright--nay, the duty--to commit murder for political purposes was first\r\npublicly expounded. With Tilak in the chair, a Brahman professor got up\r\nto vindicate Shivaji's bloody deed:--\r\n\r\n   Who dares to call that man a murderer who, when only\r\n   nine years old, had received Divine inspiration not to bow\r\n   down before a Mahomedan Emperor? Who dares to condemn\r\n   Shivaji for disregarding a minor duty in the performance\r\n   of a major one? Had Shivaji committed five or fifty\r\n   crimes more terrible, I would have been equally ready to\r\n   prostrate myself not once but one hundred times before the\r\n   image of our lord Shivaji ... Every Hindu, every\r\n   Mahratta must rejoice at this spectacle, for we too are all\r\n   striving to regain our lost independence, and it is only by\r\n   combination that we can throw off the yoke.\r\n\r\nTilak himself was even more outspoken:--\r\n\r\n   It is needless to make further researches as to the killing\r\n   of Afzul Khan. Let us even assume that Shivaji deliberately\r\n   planned and executed the murder. Was the act good or\r\n   evil? This question cannot be answered from the standpoint\r\n   of the Penal Code or of the laws of Manu or according\r\n   to the principles of morality laid down in the systems of the\r\n   West or of the East. The laws which bind society are for\r\n   common folk like you and me. No one seeks to trace the\r\n   genealogy of a Rishi or to fasten guilt upon a Maharaj. Great\r\n   men are above the common principles of morality. Such\r\n   principles do not reach to the pedestal of a great man. Did\r\n   Shivaji commit a sin in killing Afzul Khan? The answer to\r\n   this question can be found in the Mahabharata itself. The\r\n   Divine Krishna teaching in the Gita tells us we may kill\r\n   even our teachers and our kinsmen, and no blame attaches\r\n   if we are not actuated by selfish desires. Shivaji did nothing\r\n   from a desire to fill his own belly. It was in a praiseworthy\r\n   object that he murdered Afzul Khan for the good of others.\r\n   If thieves enter our house and we have not strength to drive\r\n   them out, should we not without hesitation shut them in,\r\n   and burn them alive? God has conferred on the _mlencchas_\r\n   (foreigners) no grant of Hindustan inscribed on imperishable\r\n   brass. Shivaji strove to drive them forth out of the land of\r\n   his birth, but he was guiltless of the sin of covetousness.\r\n   Do not circumscribe your vision like frogs in a well. Rise\r\n   above the Penal Code into the rarefied atmosphere of the\r\n   sacred Bhaghavad Gita and consider the action of great men.\r\n\r\nIn the reflected blaze of this apotheosis of Shivaji, Tilak stood forth\r\nas the appointed leader of the \"nation.\" He was the triumphant champion\r\nof Hindu orthodoxy, the high-priest of Ganesh, the inspired prophet of a\r\nnew \"nationalism,\" which in the name of Shivaji would cast out the hated\r\n_mlencchas_ and restore the glories of Mahratta history. The Government\r\nfeared him, for people could put no other construction on the official\r\nconfirmation of his election when he was returned in 1895 as a member of\r\nthe Bombay Legislative Council--above all, when inside the Council-room\r\nhe continued with the same audacity and the same impunity his campaign\r\nof calumny and insult. His activity was unceasing. He disdained none of\r\nthe arts which make for popularity. His house was always open to those\r\nwho sought in the right spirit for assistance or advice. He had absolute\r\ncontrol of the Sabha and ruled the municipality of Poona. In private and\r\nin public, through his speeches and through his newspapers, he worked\r\nupon the prejudices and passions of both the educated and the\r\nuneducated, and especially upon the crude enthusiasm of the young.\r\nTowards the end of 1896 the Deccan was threatened with famine. Hungry\r\nstomachs are prompt to violence, and Tilak started a \"no-rent\" campaign.\r\nLike all Tilak's schemes in those days it was carefully designed to\r\nconceal as far as possible any direct incitement to the withholding of\r\nland revenue. His missionaries went round with a story that Government\r\nhad issued orders not to collect taxes where the crops had fallen below\r\na certain yield. The _rayats_ believed them, and when the tax-gatherer\r\narrived they refused payment. Trouble then arose. Outrages such as the\r\nmutilation of the Queen's statue at Bombay, the attempt to fire the\r\nChurch Mission Hall, the assaults upon \"moderate\" Hindus who refused to\r\ntoe the line, became ominously frequent. Worse was to follow when the\r\nplague appeared. The measures at first adopted by Government to check\r\nthe spread of this new visitation doubtless offended in many ways\r\nagainst the customs and prejudices of the people, especially the\r\nsearching and disinfection of houses, and the forcible removal of\r\nplague-patients even when they happened to be Brahmans. What Tilak could\r\ndo by secret agitation and by a rabid campaign in the Press to raise\r\npopular resentment to a white heat he did. The _Kesari_ published\r\nincitements to violence which were put into the mouth of Shivaji\r\nhimself[4]. The inevitable consequences ensued. On June 27, 1897, on\r\ntheir way back from an official reception in celebration of Queen\r\nVictoria's Diamond Jubilee, Mr. Rand, an Indian civilian, who was\r\nPresident of the Poona Plague Committee, and Lieutenant Ayerst, of the\r\nCommissariat Department, were shot down by Damodhar Chapekur, a young\r\nChitpavan Brahman, on the Ganeshkind road. No direct connexion has been\r\nestablished between that crime and Tilak. But, like the murderer of Mr.\r\nJackson at Nasik last winter, the murderer of Rand and Ayerst--the same\r\nyoung Brahman who had recited the _Shlok_, which I have quoted above, at\r\nthe great Shivaji celebration--declared that it was the doctrines\r\nexpounded in Tilak's newspapers that had driven him to the deed. The\r\nmurderer who had merely given effect to the teachings of Tilak was\r\nsentenced to death, but Tilak himself, who was prosecuted for a\r\nseditious article published a few days before the murder, received only\r\na short term of imprisonment, and was released before the completion of\r\nhis term under certain pledges of good behaviour which he broke as soon\r\nas it suited him to break them.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first campaign of Indian unrest, which, in its details,\r\nhas served as an incitement and a model to all those who have conducted\r\nsubsequent operations in the same field.\r\n\r\nThe Poona murders sent a thrill of horror throughout India and caused a\r\nmomentary sensation even in England. But though Government was not\r\nwholly blind to the warning, it could not decide what ought to be done,\r\nand beyond tinkering at one or two sections of the Criminal Code bearing\r\non Press offences, it did nothing until history had repeated itself on a\r\nmuch larger scale. Tilak was generously released from prison before the\r\nexpiration of his sentence, and his release was construed in the Deccan\r\nas a fresh triumph. He was acclaimed by his followers as a \"national\"\r\nmartyr and hero. After a short \"rest-cure\" in a sanatorium Tilak\r\nreturned to the _Kesari_, which, in the hands of his co-adjutors, two\r\nother Chitpavan Brahmans, Mr. Kelkar and Mr. Khadilkar, had lost nothing\r\nof its vitriolic pungency in his absence. The celebration with renewed\r\npomp in 1900 of Shivaji's \"birthday\" at Raighar marked the resumption of\r\nTilak's operations. I need not stop to recount all the incidents of this\r\nsecond campaign in the Deccan, in which Ganpati celebrations, Shivaji\r\nfestivals, gymnastic societies, &c., played exactly the same part as in\r\nthe first campaign. For three or four years the Tai Maharaj case, in\r\nwhich, as executor of one of his friends, Shri Baba Maharaj, a Sirdar of\r\nPoona, Tilak was attacked by the widow and indicted on charges of\r\nforgery, perjury, and corruption, absorbed a great deal of his time,\r\nbut, after long and wearisome proceedings, the earlier stages of the\r\ncase ended in a judgment in his favour which was greeted as another\r\ntriumph for him, and not unnaturally though, as recent developments have\r\nshown, quite prematurely,[5] won him much sympathy, even amongst those\r\nwho were politically opposed to him. But throughout this ordeal Tilak\r\nnever relaxed his political activity either in the Press or in the\r\nmanifold organizations which he controlled.\r\n\r\nHis influence, moreover, was rapidly extending far beyond, Poona and the\r\nDeccan. He had at an early date associated himself with, the Indian\r\nNational Congress, and he was secretary of the Standing Committee for\r\nthe Deccan. His Congress work had brought him into contact with the\r\npoliticians of other provinces, and upon none did his teachings and his\r\nexample produce so deep an impression as upon the emotional Bengalees.\r\nHe had not the gift of sonorous eloquence which they possess, and he\r\nnever figured conspicuously as an orator at the annual sessions of\r\nCongress. But his calculating resourcefulness and his indomitable\r\nenergy, even his masterfulness, impressed them all the more, and in the\r\ntwo memorable sessions held at Benares in 1905 and at Calcutta in 1906,\r\nwhen the agitation over the Partition of Bengal was at its height, his\r\nwas the dominant personality, not at the tribune, but in the lobbies. He\r\nhad been one of the first champions of _Swadeshi_ as an economic weapon\r\nin the struggle against British rule, and he saw in the adoption of the\r\nboycott, with all the lawlessness which it involved, an unprecedented\r\nopportunity of stimulating the active forces of disaffection. As far as\r\nBengal was concerned, an \"advanced\" Press which always took its cue from\r\nTilak's _Kesari_ had already done its work, and Tilak could rely upon\r\nthe enthusiastic support of men like Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal and Mr.\r\nArabindo Ghose, who were politically his disciples, though their\r\nreligious and social standpoints were in many respects different, Mr.\r\nSurendranath Banerjee, who subsequently fell out with Tilak, had at\r\nfirst modelled his propaganda very largely upon that of the Deccan\r\nleader. Not only had he tried to introduce into Bengal the singularly\r\ninappropriate cult of Shivaji, but he had been clearly inspired by\r\nTilak's methods in placing the _Swadeshi_ boycott in Bengal under the\r\nspecial patronage of so popular a deity as the \"terrible goddess\" Kali.\r\nAgain, he had followed Tilak's example in brigading schoolboys and\r\nstudents into youthful gymnastic societies for purposes of political\r\nagitation, Tilak's main object at the moment was to pledge the rest of\r\nIndia, as represented in the Congress, to the violent course upon which\r\nBengal was embarking. Amongst the \"moderate\" section outside Bengal\r\nthere was a disposition to confine its action to platonic expressions of\r\nsympathy with the Bengalees and with the principle of _Swadeshi_--in\r\nitself perfectly legitimate--as a movement for the encouragement of\r\nnative industries. At Benares in 1905 the Congress had adopted a\r\nresolution which only conditionally endorsed the boycott, and the\r\nincreasing disorders which had subsequently accompanied its enforcement\r\nhad tended to enhance rather than to diminish the reluctance of the\r\nModerate party to see the Congress definitely pledged to it when it met\r\nat the end of 1906 in Calcutta. The \"advanced\" party led by Mr. Bepin\r\nChandra Pal had put forward Tilak's candidature to the presidency, and a\r\nsplit which seemed imminent was only avoided by a compromise which saved\r\nappearances. Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, a leading Parsee of Bombay, who had\r\nbeen drawn into co-operation with the Congress under the influence of\r\nthe political Liberalism which he had heard expounded in England by\r\nGladstone and Bright, played at this critical period an important part\r\nwhich deserves recognition. He was as eloquent as any Bengalee, and he\r\npossessed in a high degree the art of managing men. In politics he was\r\nas stout an opponent of Tilak's violent methods as was Mr. Gokhale on\r\nsocial and religious questions, and he did perhaps more than any one\r\nelse to prevent the complete triumph of Tilakism in the Congress right\r\ndown to the Surat upheaval. Thanks largely to his efforts, the veteran\r\nMr. Naoroji was elected to the chair at Calcutta. None could venture\r\nopenly to oppose him, for he was almost the father of the Congress,\r\nwhich in its early days had owed so much to the small group of liberal\r\nParsees whom he had gathered about him, and his high personal character\r\nand rectitude of purpose had earned for him universal respect.\r\nNevertheless, a resolution as amended by Tilak was adopted which,\r\nwithout mentioning the word \"boycott,\" pledged the Congress to encourage\r\nits practice. But there was considerable heartburning, and the Moderates\r\nwere suspected of contemplating some retrograde move at the following\r\nannual session. Tilak was determined to frustrate any such scheme, and\r\nbefore the Congress assembled at Surat he elaborated at a Nationalist\r\nconference with Mr. Arabindo Ghose in the chair, a plan of campaign\r\nwhich was to defeat the \"moderates\" by demanding, before the election of\r\nthe president, an undertaking that the resolutions of the Calcutta\r\nconference should be upheld. The plan, however, was only half\r\nsuccessful. The first day's proceedings produced a violent scene in\r\nwhich the howling down of Mr. Surendranath Banerjee by the \"advanced\"\r\nwing revealed the personal jealousies that had grown up between the old\r\nBengalee leader on the one hand and Tilak and his younger followers in\r\nBengal on the other. The second day's proceedings ended in still wilder\r\nconfusion, and after something like a free fight the Congress broke up\r\nafter an irreparable rupture, from which its prestige has never\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nTilak's own prestige, however, with the \"advanced\" party never stood\r\nhigher, either in then Deccan or outside of it. In the Deccan he not\r\nonly maintained all his old activities, but had extended their field.\r\nBesides the _Kal_, edited by another Chitpawan Brahman, and the\r\n_Rashtramadt_ at Poona, which went to even greater lengths than Tilak's\r\nown _Kesari_, lesser papers obeying his inspiration had been established\r\nin many of the smaller centres. A movement had been set on foot for the\r\ncreation of \"national\" schools, entirely independent of State support,\r\nand therefore of State supervision, in which disaffection could, without\r\nlet or hindrance, be made part and parcel of the curriculum. Such were\r\nthe schools closed down last year in the Central Provinces and this year\r\nat Telegaon. The great development of the cotton industry during the\r\nlast ten years, especially in Bombay itself--which has led to vast\r\nagglomerations of labour under conditions unfamiliar in India--had given\r\nTilak an opportunity of establishing contact with a class of the\r\npopulation hitherto outside the purview of Indian politics. There are\r\nnearly 100 cotton spinning and weaving mills, employing over 100,000\r\noperatives, congregated mostly in the northern suburbs of the city.\r\nHuddled together in huge tenements this compact population affords by\r\nits density, as well as by its ignorance, a peculiarly accessible field\r\nto the trained agitator. Tilak's emissaries, mostly Brahmans of the\r\nDeccan, brought, moreover, to their nefarious work the added prestige of\r\na caste which seldom condescends to rub shoulders with those whose mere\r\ncontact may involve \"pollution.\" In this, as in many other cases,\r\npolitics were closely mixed up with philanthropy, for the conditions of\r\nlabour in India are by no means wholly satisfactory, and it would be\r\nunfair to deny to many of Tilak's followers a genuine desire to mitigate\r\nthe evils and hardships to which their humbler fellow-creatures were\r\nexposed. Prominent amongst such evils was the growth of drunkenness, and\r\nit would have been all to his honour that Tilak hastened to take up the\r\ncause of temperance, had he not perverted it, as he perverted everything\r\nelse, to the promotion of race-hatred. His primary motives may have been\r\nexcellent, but he subordinated all things to his ruling anti-British\r\npassion, whilst the fervour of his philanthropic professions won for him\r\nthe sympathy and co-operation of many law-abiding citizens who would\r\notherwise have turned a deaf ear to his political doctrines. He must\r\nhave had a considerable command of funds for the purposes of his\r\npropaganda, and though he doubtless had not a few willing and generous\r\nsupporters, many subscribed from fear of the lash which he knew how to\r\napply through the Press to the tepid and the recalcitrant, just as his\r\ngymnastic societies sometimes resolved themselves into juvenile bands of\r\ndacoities to swell the coffers of _Swaraj_. Not even Mr. Gokhale with\r\nall his moral and intellectual force could stem the flowing tide of\r\nTilak's popularity in the Deccan; and in order not to be swept under he\r\nwas perhaps often compelled like many other Moderates to go further than\r\nhis own judgment can have approved. Tilak commanded the allegiance of\r\nbarristers and pleaders, schoolmasters and professors, clerks in\r\nGovernment offices--in fact, of the large majority of the so-called\r\neducated classes, largely recruited amongst his own and other Brahman\r\ncastes; and his propaganda had begun to filter down not only to the\r\ncoolies in the cities, but even to the rayats, or at least the head-men\r\nin the villages.\r\n\r\nMore than that. From the Deccan, as we have already seen in his\r\nrelations with the Indian National Congress, his influence was projected\r\nfar and wide. His house was a place of pilgrimage for the disaffected\r\nfrom all parts of India. His prestige as a Brahman of the Brahmans and a\r\npillar of orthodoxy, in spite of the latitude of the views which he\r\nsometimes expressed in regard to the depressed castes, his reputation\r\nfor profound learning in the philosophies both of the West and of the\r\nEast, his trenchant style, his indefatigable activity, the glamour of\r\nhis philanthropy, his accessibility to high and low, his many acts of\r\ngenuine kindliness, the personal magnetism which, without any great\r\nphysical advantages, he exerted upon most of those who came in contact\r\nwith him, and especially upon the young, combined to equip him more\r\nfully than any other Indian politician for the leadership of a\r\nrevolutionary movement.\r\n\r\nThe appeal which Tilak made to the Hindus was twofold. He taught them,\r\non the one hand, that India, and especially Maharashtra, the land of the\r\nMahrattas, had been happier and better and more prosperous under a Hindu\r\n_raj_ than it had ever been or could ever be under the rule of alien\r\n\"demons\"; and that if the British _raj_ had at one time served some\r\nuseful purpose in introducing India to the scientific achievements of\r\nWestern civilisation, it had done so at ruinous cost, both material and\r\nmoral, to the Indians whose wealth it had drained and whose social and\r\nreligious institutions it had undermined, and on the other hand he held\r\nout to them the prospect that, if power were once restored to the\r\nBrahmans, who had already learnt all that there was of good to be\r\nlearnt from the English, the golden age would return for gods and men.\r\nThat Tilak himself hardly believed in the possibility of overthrowing\r\nBritish rule is more than probable, but what some Indians who knew him\r\nwell tell me he did believe was that the British could be driven or\r\nwearied by a ceaseless and menacing agitation into gradually\r\nsurrendering to the Brahmans the reality of power, as did the later\r\nPeshwas, and remaining content with the mere shadow of sovereignty. As\r\none of his organs blurted it out:--\"If the British yield all power to us\r\nand retain only nominal control, we may yet be friends.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the position when, on June 24, 1908, Tilak was arrested in\r\nBombay on charges connected with the publication in the _Kesari_ of\r\narticles containing inflammatory comments on the Muzafferpur outrage, in\r\nwhich Mrs. and Miss Kennedy had been killed by a bomb--the first of a\r\nlong list of similar outrages in Bengal. Not in the moment of first\r\nexcitement, but weeks afterwards, the _Kesari_ had commented on this\r\ncrime in terms which the Parsee Judge, Mr. Justice Davar, described in\r\nhis summing up as follows:--\"They are seething with sedition; they\r\npreach violence; they speak of murders with approval; and the cowardly\r\nand atrocious act of committing murders with bombs not only meets with\r\nyour approval, but you hail the advent of the bomb into India as if\r\nsomething had come to India for its good.\" The bomb was extolled in\r\nthese articles as \"a kind of witchcraft, a charm, an amulet,\" and the\r\n_Kesari_ delighted in showing that neither the \"supervision of the\r\npolice\" nor \"swarms of detectives\" could stop \"these simple playful\r\nsports of science,\" Whilst professing to deprecate such methods, it\r\nthrew the responsibility upon Government, which allowed \"keen\r\ndisappointment to overtake thousands of intelligent persons who have\r\nbeen awakened to the necessity of securing the rights of _Swaraj_.\"\r\nTilak spoke four whole days in his own defence--21-1/2 hours\r\naltogether--but the jury returned a verdict of \"Guilty,\" and he was\r\nsentenced to six years' transportation, afterwards commuted on account\r\nof his age and health to simple imprisonment at Mandalay.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of a man of Tilak's popularity and influence at a time\r\nwhen neither the Imperial Government nor the Government of India had\r\nrealized the full danger of the situation was undoubtedly a grave\r\nmeasure of which a weaker Government than that of Bombay under Sir\r\nGeorge Clarke might well have shirked the responsibility. There were\r\nserious riots after the trial. From the moment of his arrest Tilak's\r\nfollowers had put it about amongst the mill-hands that he was in prison\r\nbecause he was their friend and had sought to obtain better pay for\r\nthem. Some of his supporters are said to have declared during the trial\r\nthat there would be a day's bloodshed for every year to which he might\r\nbe sentenced by the Court, and, as a matter of fact, he was sentenced to\r\nsix years' imprisonment and the riots lasted six days. The rioting\r\nassumed at times a very threatening character. The European police\r\nfrequently had to use their revolvers, and the troops had several times\r\nto fire in self-defence. But rigorous orders had been issued by the\r\nauthorities to avoid as far as possible the shedding of blood, and both\r\nthe police and the military forces exercised such steady self-restraint\r\nthat casualties were relatively few, and the violence of the mob never\r\nvented itself upon the European population of the city. The gravity of\r\nthe disturbances, however, showed the extent and the lawless character\r\nof the influence which Tilak had already acquired over the lower classes\r\nin Bombay, and not merely over the turbulent mill-hands. In the heart of\r\nthe city many Hindu shops were closed \"out of sympathy with Tilak,\" and\r\nthe most violent rioting on one day occurred amongst the Bhattias and\r\nBanias employed in the cloth market, who had hitherto been regarded as\r\nvery orderly and rather timid folk. The trouble in Bombay was certainly\r\nnot a sudden and spontaneous outburst of popular feeling. It bore\r\nthroughout the impress of careful and deliberate organization. By a\r\nhappy combination of sympathy and firmness Sir George Clarke had,\r\nhowever, won the respect of the vast majority of the community, and\r\nthough he failed to secure the active support which he might have\r\nexpected from the \"moderates,\" there were few of them who did not\r\nsecretly approve and even welcome his action. Its effects were great and\r\nenduring, for Tilak's conviction was a heavy blow--perhaps the heaviest\r\nwhich has been dealt--to the forces of unrest, at least in the Deccan;\r\nand some months later one of the organs of his party, the _Rashtramat_,\r\nreviewing the occurrences of the year, was fain to admit that \"the\r\nsudden removal of Mr. Tilak's towering personality threw the whole\r\nprovince into dismay and unnerved the other leaders.\"\r\n\r\nThe agitation in the Deccan did not die out with Tilak's disappearance,\r\nfor he left his stamp upon a new generation, which he had educated and\r\ntrained. More than a year after Tilak had been removed to Mandalay, his\r\ndoctrines bore fruit in the murder of Mr. Jackson, the Collector of\r\nNasik--a murder which, in the whole lamentable record of political\r\ncrimes in India, stands out in many ways pre-eminently infamous and\r\nsignificant. The chief executive officer of a large district, \"Pundit\"\r\nJackson, as he was familiarly called, was above all a scholar, devoted\r\nto Indian studies, and his sympathy with all forms of Indian thought was\r\nas genuine as his acquaintance with them was profound. His affection for\r\nthe natives was such as, perhaps, to blind him to their faults, and like\r\nthe earliest victims of the Indian Mutiny he entertained to the very\r\nlast an almost childlike confidence in the loyalty of the whole people.\r\nOnly a few days before his death he expressed his conviction that\r\ndisaffection had died out in Nasik, and that he could go anywhere, and\r\nat any hour without the slightest risk of danger. That he was very\r\ngenerally respected and even beloved by many there can be no doubt, and\r\nthere is no reason to question the sincerity of the regrets which found\r\nexpression on the announcement of his impending transfer to Bombay in a\r\nseries of farewell entertainments, both public and private, by the\r\ninhabitants of the city. Only two days before the fatal 21st of\r\nDecember, an ode in Marathi addressed to him at a reception organized by\r\nthe Municipal Council dwelt specially upon his gentleness of soul and\r\nkindliness of manner.\r\n\r\nYet this was the man whom the fanatical champions of Indian Nationalism\r\nin the Deccan singled out for assassination as a protest against British\r\ntyranny. The trial of the actual murderer and of those who aided and\r\nabetted him abundantly demonstrated the cold-blooded premeditation which\r\ncharacterized this crime. Numerous consultations had taken place ever\r\nsince the previous September between the murderer and his accomplices as\r\nto the manner and time of the deed. It was repeatedly postponed because\r\nthe accomplices who belonged to Nasik were afraid of rendering active\r\nassistance which might compromise them, though they were ready enough to\r\narm the hand of the wretched youth from Aurungabad who had volunteered\r\nto strike the blow. Ready as he was to kill any Englishman, he himself\r\nhad some misgivings as to the expediency of selecting a victim whose\r\npersonal qualities were so universally recognized, and these misgivings\r\nwere only allayed by the assurance that all that was mere hypocrisy on\r\npoor Jackson's part. It was the news of Jackson's approaching departure\r\nfor Bombay that finally precipitated the catastrophe. The murderer\r\npractised carefully with the pistol given to him and other precautions\r\nwere taken so that, even if the first attempt was foiled, Jackson should\r\nnot escape alive from the theatre--the native theatre which he had been\r\nasked to honour with his attendance. So the young Chitpavan Brahman,\r\nAnanta Luxman Kanhere, waylaid the Englishman as he was entering, shot\r\nhim first in the back, and then emptied the contents of his revolver\r\nupon him, as he turned round. Mr. Jackson fell dead in front of the\r\nfriends who were accompanying him, two young English ladies and a young\r\ncivilian of his staff, who had only joined a month before from England\r\nand faced without flinching this gruesome initiation into the service.\r\nIt all happened in a moment, and the native Deputy Collector, Mr.\r\nPalshikar, who leapt forward to Mr. Jackson's assistance, was only able\r\nto strike down the murderer and tear from him the second weapon with\r\nwhich he was armed. Thanks also to Mr. Palshikar's presence of mind,\r\ninformation was at once sent to the railway station, and the escape of\r\nsome of the accomplices prevented, whose confessions materially helped\r\nin promoting the ends of justice.\r\n\r\nBut besides the facts which were brought out in evidence during the\r\ntrial at Bombay, there are some features connected with the crime to\r\nwhich attention may be usefully directed, as they lie outside the\r\nprovince of the Law Courts. In the first place, it must be noted that\r\nnot only the murderer but the majority of those implicated in the crime\r\nwere Chitpavan Brahmans, and at the same time they were the strange\r\nproducts both of the Western education which we have imported into India\r\nand of the religious revivalism which underlies the present political\r\nagitation. They were certainly moral, if not physical, degenerates, and\r\nmost of them notoriously depraved, none bearing in this respect a worse\r\ncharacter than the actual murderer. I happened, when at Nasik, to see\r\nthe latter whilst he was performing his ablutions in front of the\r\nGovernment building in which he was confined. Four policemen were in\r\ncharge of him, but he seemed absolutely unconcerned, and after having\r\nwashed himself leisurely, proceeded to discharges his devotions, looking\r\naround all the while with a certain self-satisfied composure, before\r\nreturning to his cell. His appearance was puny, undergrown, and\r\neffeminate, and his small, narrow, and elongated head markedly\r\nprognathous, but he exercised over some of his companions a passionate,\r\nif unnatural, fascination which, I have been told by one who was present\r\nat the trial, betrayed itself shamelessly in their attitude and the\r\nglances they exchanged with him during the proceedings. Distorted pride\r\nof race and of caste combined with neuroticism and eroticism appear to\r\nhave co-operated here in producing as complete a type of moral\r\nperversion as the records of criminal pathology can well show.\r\n\r\nWhat are the secret forces by which these wretched puppets were set in\r\nmotion? Their activity was certainly not spontaneous. Who was it that\r\npulled the strings? There is reason to believe that the revolver with\r\nwhich the murder was committed was one of a batch sent out by the Indian\r\nringleaders, who until the murder of Sir W. Curzon-Wyllie, had their\r\nheadquarters at the famous \"India House,\" in Highgate, of which Swami\r\nKrishnavarma was originally one of the moving spirits. Upon this and\r\nother cognate points the trial of Vinayak Savarkar, formerly the London\r\ncorrespondent of one of Tilak's organs and a familiar of the \"India\r\nHouse,\" and of some twenty-five other Hindus on various charges of\r\nconspiracy which is now proceeding in the High Court of Bombay, may be\r\nexpected to throw some very instructive light.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Nasik was no doubt exceptionally favourable for such\r\nmorbid growths. For Nasik is no ordinary provincial town of India. It is\r\none of the great strongholds of Hinduism. Its population is only about\r\n25,000, but of these about 9,000 belong to the Brahmanical caste, though\r\nonly about 1,000 are Chitpavan Brahmans, the rest being mainly Deshastha\r\nBrahmans, another great sept of the Deccanee sacerdotal caste. It is a\r\ncity of peculiar sanctity with the Hindus. The sacred Godavery--so\r\nsacred that it is called there the _Ganga_--i.e. the Ganges--flows\r\nthrough it, and its bathing _ghats_ which line the river banks and its\r\nancient temples and innumerable shrines attract a constant flow of\r\npilgrims from all parts of India. Indeed, many of the great Hindu\r\nhouses of India maintain there a family priest to look after their\r\nspiritual interests. Nasik was, moreover, a city beloved of the Peshwas,\r\nand, next to Poona preserves, perhaps, more intimate associations with\r\nthe great days of the Mahratta Empire than any other city of the Deccan.\r\nBut though no doubt these facts might account for a certain latent\r\nbitterness against the alien rulers who dashed the cup of victory away\r\nfrom the lips of the Mahrattas, just as the latter were establishing\r\ntheir ascendency on the crumbling ruins of the Moghul Empire, they do\r\nnot suffice to account for the attitude of the people generally in\r\npresence of such a crime as the assassination of Mr. Jackson. For if\r\nmurder is a heinous crime by whomsoever it may be committed, it ranks\r\namongst Hindus as specially heinous when committed by a Brahman. How is\r\nit that in this instance, instead of outcasting the murderer, many\r\nBrahmans continued more or less secretly to glorify his crime as \"the\r\nstriking down of the flag from the fort\"? How is it that, when there was\r\nample evidence to show that murder had been in the air of Nasik for\r\nseveral months before the perpetration of the deed, not a single\r\nwarning, not a single hint, ever reached Mr. Jackson, except from the\r\npolice, whose advice, unfortunately, his blindly trustful nature led him\r\nto ignore to the very end? How is it that, even after its perpetration,\r\nthough there was much genuine sympathy with the victim and many eloquent\r\nspeeches were delivered to express righteous abhorrence of the crime, no\r\npractical help was afforded to the authorities in pursuing the\r\nramifications of the conspiracy which had \"brought disgrace on the holy\r\ncity of Nasik\"?\r\n\r\nAll this opens up wide fields for speculation, but there is one point\r\nwhich a statement solemnly made by the murderer of Mr. Jackson has\r\nplaced beyond the uncertainties of speculation. In reply to the\r\nmagistrate who asked him why he committed the murder, Kanhere said:--\r\n\r\n   I read of many instances of oppression in the _Kesari_, the\r\n   _Rashtramat_ and the _Kal_ and other newspapers. I think\r\n   that by killing _sahibs_ [Englishmen] we people can get justice.\r\n   I never got injustice myself nor did any one I know. I now\r\n   regret killing Mr. Jackson. I killed a good man causelessly.\r\n\r\nCan anything be much more eloquent and convincing than the terrible\r\npathos of this confession?[6] The three papers named by Kanhere were\r\nTilak's organs. It was no personal experience or knowledge of his own\r\nthat had driven Kanhere to his frenzied deed, but the slow persistent\r\npoison dropped into his ear by the Tilak Press. Though it was Kanhere's\r\nhand that struck down \"a good man causelessly,\" was not Tilak rather\r\nthan Kanhere the real author of the murder? It was merely the story of\r\nthe Poona murders of 1897 over again.\r\n\r\nOther incidents besides the Nasik tragedy have occurred since Tilak's\r\nconviction to show how dangerous was the spirit which his doctrines had\r\naroused. One of the, gravest, symptomatically, was the happily\r\nunsuccessful attempt to throw a bomb at the Viceroy and Lady Minto\r\nwhilst they were driving through the streets of Ahmedabad during their\r\nvisit to the Bombay Presidency last November. For that outrage\r\nconstituted an ominous breach of all the old Hindu traditions which\r\ninvest the personal representative of the Sovereign with a special\r\nsanctity.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of spasmodic outbreaks, of which we may not yet have seen\r\nthe end, aggressive disloyalty in the Deccan has been at least\r\ntemporarily set back since the downfall of Tilak. The firmer attitude\r\nadopted by the Government of India and such repressive measures as the\r\nPress Act, combined with judicious reforms, have done much; but it was\r\nby the prosecution of Tilak that the forces of militant unrest lost\r\ntheir ablest and boldest leader--perhaps the only one who might have\r\nconcentrated their direction, not only in the Deccan, but in the whole\r\nof India, in his own hands and given to the movement, with all its\r\nvaried and often conflicting tendencies, an organization and unity which\r\nit still happily seems to lack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPOONA AND KOLHAPUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not, after all, in British India (i.e., in that part of India\r\nwhich we directly administer) that the Brahmanical and reactionary\r\ncharacter of Indian unrest, at any rate in the Deccan, can best be\r\nstudied. There it can always be disguised under the \"patriotic\" aspects\r\nof a revolt against alien rule. To appreciate its real tendencies we\r\nmust go to a Native State of the Deccan about 100 miles south of Poona.\r\nKolhapur is the most important of the Native States under the charge of\r\nthe Bombay Government, and its ruler is the only ruling Mahratta chief\r\nwho can claim direct descent from the great Shivaji, the\r\n\"Shivaji-Maharaj\" whose cult Tilak made one of the central features of\r\nhis political propaganda. He is the \"Chhatrapati Maharajah,\" and is\r\nacknowledged to be as such the head of the Mahratta Princes of India.\r\nOne would have thought that such a lineage would have sufficed in itself\r\nto invest the Maharajah of Kolhapur with a certain measure of sanctity\r\nin the eyes of Tilak and his followers. Far from it. His Highness is an\r\nenlightened ruler and a man of great simplicity of character. He takes a\r\nkeen interest in the administration of his State, and has undertaken, at\r\nno small cost to his Exchequer, one of the most important irrigation\r\nworks yet attempted in any Native State. But he committed what Tilak\r\nand his friends regarded as two unforgivable offences: he fought against\r\nthe intolerance of the Brahmans and he is a faithful friend end ally of\r\nthe British _Raj_. Hence they set in motion against him, the descendant\r\nof Shivaji, in his own State, exactly the same machinery of agitation\r\nand conspiracy which they have set in motion against British rule in\r\nBritish India.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious and most instructive story. There had been long\r\nminorities in Kolhapur, and, especially during the more or less nominal\r\nreign of the present Maharajah's predecessor, Shivaji IV., who\r\nultimately went mad, the Prime Minister, a Chitpavan Brahman of\r\nRatnagiri, acquired almost supreme power in the State, and filled every\r\nimportant post with his fellow caste men, of whom he introduced more\r\nthan a hundred into the public service. Under Chitpavan rule the\r\ninterests of the people of the soil were systematically neglected in\r\nKolhapur, as they had been throughout the Deccan in the later days of\r\nthe Chitpavan theocracy at Poona, and privileges and possessions were\r\nshowered upon members of the favoured caste. On his accession in 1894\r\nthe present Maharajah appointed as his Prime Minister, with a view to\r\nvery necessary reforms in the administration, a Kayastha Prabhu, Rao\r\nBahadur Sabnis, who, though a high-caste Hindu, was not a Brahman. There\r\nhas long been great rivalry between the Brahmans and the Prabhus, who\r\nbelong mostly to the moderate progressive school of Hinduism. The\r\nappointment of Mr. Sabnis, besides portending unpalatable reforms, was\r\ntherefore in itself very unwelcome to the Kolhapur Brahmans, amongst\r\nwhom one of the most influential, Mr. B.N. Joshi, the Chief Judge, was a\r\npersonal friend of Tilak. Consternation increased when the young\r\nMaharajah announced his intention of promoting to positions of trust\r\nsuch non-Brahmans as should be found capable of filling them and\r\nactually started educating non-Brahmans for the purpose. In order to put\r\npressure upon their ruler, the Brahmans had recourse to one of the most\r\npowerful weapons with which the semi-religious, semi-social structure of\r\nHinduism has armed them. They questioned his caste and refused to recite\r\nat certain religious ceremonies in his family the Vedic hymns, to which\r\nas a Kshatriya (i.e., as a member of the \"twice-born\" caste ranking\r\nnext to the Brahmans) his Highness claimed to be traditionally entitled.\r\nThe stalwart Brahmans of the Deccan allege, it seems, that in this _Kali\r\nYuga_, or Age of Darkness, there can be no Kshatriyas, since there is no\r\nroom or a warrior caste in the orthodox sense under an alien rule, and\r\nthat therefore the Hindus who are neither Brahmans nor pariahs can at\r\nbest be Shudras--a \"clean\" caste, but not even entitled to wear the\r\n\"sacred thread\" reserved for the highest castes.\r\n\r\nThe Maharajah remained firm, for this insult, though aimed chiefly at\r\nhim, affected equally all high-caste Mahrattas who were not Brahmans. To\r\ntheir credit be it said, several of the more progressive Brahmans,\r\nbraving the pressure of their fellow caste-men at Poona and in Kolhapur\r\nitself, stood by his Highness. The dispute was aggravated when the\r\nRajpadhya--the family priest of the Kolhapur ruling family--himself\r\nrefused the Vedic ritual to his Highness, even when two Judges, both\r\nBrahmans, who were appointed to form with him a committee of three to\r\ndecide the issue, pronounced in favour of the Maharajah's claim. His\r\nHighness then took the case to the Sankeshwar Shankaracharya, the\r\nhighest religious authority with jurisdiction in such matters. But the\r\nfeud only grew the more bitter, as, owing to the death of the incumbent\r\nof that high office, rival candidatures were put forward to the\r\nsuccession by the Maharajah's supporters on the one hand and by Tilak\r\nand his friends on the other. To the present day the feud continues, and\r\nthe present Shankaracharya is not recognized by the Poona school of\r\nBrahmans. Nor is he likely to be, as he has had the unique courage\r\npublicly to condemn as a Brahman the murder of Mr. Jackson by Brahmans.\r\n\r\nI have already remarked with reference to the Nasik tragedy that, if\r\nmurder is a heinous crime by whomsoever committed, it ranks amongst\r\nHindus as specially heinous when committed by a Brahman; and I have\r\nasked several Brahmans how it is that instead of outcasting the murderer\r\nmany Brahmans continue more or less secretly to glorify his crime. Some\r\nhave admitted that there is a strong case for the public excommunication\r\nof Brahmans guilty of political murder, some have regretted that no such\r\naction has ever been taken by the caste authorities, some have argued\r\nthat caste organization has been so loosened that any collective action\r\nwould be impracticable. Only in Kolhapur has a Brahman, qualified to\r\nspeak with the highest religious authority in the name of Hindu sacred\r\nlaw, been found to have in this respect the courage of his convictions.\r\nThis Brahman was no less a personage than the Shankaracharya of the\r\nKarveer Petha, who took the very noteworthy step of issuing a\r\nproclamation solemnly reprobating the murder committed by a Brahman \"in\r\nthe holy city of Nasik\" as \"a stain on the Brahmanical religion of mercy\r\nemphatically preached by Manu and other law-givers.\" After paying a warm\r\ntribute to Mr. Jackson's personal qualities and great learning, and\r\nquoting sacred texts to show that \"such a murder is to be condemned the\r\nmore when a Brahman commits it,\" and renders the murderer liable to the\r\nmost awful penalties in the next world, the proclamation proceeded to\r\ndeclare that \"his Holiness is pleased to excommunicate the wicked\r\npersons who have committed the present offence, and who shall commit\r\nsimilar offences against the State, and none of the disciples of this\r\nPetha shall have any dealings with such sinful men.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the majority of Brahmans in Kolhapur and elsewhere this\r\nproclamation, I fear, found no echo, for their hostility towards their\r\nown Maharajah had often assumed or encouraged criminal forms of\r\nviolence. It had certainly not remained confined to the spiritual\r\ndomain, and it became absolutely savage when, in 1902, his Highness\r\ndeclared that he would reserve at least half the posts in the State for\r\nqualified men of the non-Brahman communities. Under the constant\r\ninspiration of Poona, the Tilak Press waged relentless war against his\r\nHighness, preaching disaffection towards his Government, just as it\r\npreached disaffection towards the British _Raj_; and the agitation in\r\nKolhapur itself was reinforced by the advent of a large number of Poona\r\nBrahmans who, in consequence of a recrudescence of plague, fled from\r\nthat city to the Maharajah's capital. They flung themselves eagerly into\r\nthe fray, and had the audacity even to start a mock \"Parliament.\" But\r\nthe Maharajah was determined to be master in his own State, and in Mr.\r\nSabnis he had found a Prime Minister who loyally and courageously\r\ncarried out his policy for the improvement of the administration and the\r\nspread of education amongst the non-Brahman castes. The Maharajah\r\nrealizes that Brahman ascendency cannot be broken down permanently\r\nunless the non-Brahman castes are adequately equipped to compete with\r\nthem in the public services. Amongst these there is plenty of loyalty to\r\nthe ruling chief, for his Mahratta subjects have not wholly forgotten\r\nthe tyranny of Chitpavan Brahman rule either under Shivaji IV.'s Prime\r\nMinister or in the less recent times of the Poona Peshwas. One of the\r\nmost interesting institutions in Kolhapur is a hostel specially endowed\r\nfor non-Brahman, Mahratta, Mahomedan, and Jain youths who are following\r\nthe courses of the Rajaram College. The control of education plays in\r\nKolhapur as conspicuous a part as at Poona in the struggle between the\r\nforces of order and disorder, and it is amongst the Kolhapur youth that\r\nthe latter have made their most strenuous exertions and with the same\r\nlawless results.\r\n\r\nThe first organization started at Kolhapur in imitation of Poona was a\r\nShivaji club, with which were associated bands of gymnasts, Ganpati\r\nchoirs, an anti-cow-killing society, &c., all on the lines of those\r\nfounded by Tilak. It was suppressed in 1900 as several of its members\r\nhad been implicated in the disturbances at Bir, where a young \"patriot\"\r\nhad proclaimed himself Rajah and collected a sufficient number of armed\r\nfollowers to require a military force to suppress the rebellion. The\r\ndisturbances at Bir were, in fact, the starting point of that new form\r\nof political propagandism which takes the shape of dacoities or armed\r\nrobberies for the benefit of the \"patriotic\" war-chest. After the\r\nsuppression of the Kolhapur Shivaji Club, many of its leading members\r\ndisappeared for a time, but only to carry on their operations in other\r\nparts of India, where they entered into relations with secret societies\r\nof a similar type. Three years later the club had been practically\r\nrevived under the new name of \"Belapur Swami Club,\" so called in honour\r\nof the late Swami of Belapur, to whose wooden slippers the members of\r\nthe club were in the habit of doing worship, whilst his shrine was used\r\nas a sanctuary for sedition-mongers and a store-house for illicit\r\nweapons. \"Political\" dacoities were soon in vogue again, and in 1905\r\nthere was an epidemic of house-breaking in and around Kolhapur, which\r\nenriched the club with several thousands of rupees and a few arms. Seven\r\nmembers were finally arrested and some made full confessions. All of\r\nthese except one were Brahmans and mostly quite well connected. But even\r\nthose who were convicted got off with light sentences, and the campaign,\r\nwhich clearly had powerful aiders and abettors both inside Kolhapur and\r\noutside, was only temporarily checked.\r\n\r\nNor was it to stop at dacoities. A regular semi-military organization\r\nwas introduced, and bands of young men used to go out into the country\r\nto carry out mimic manoeuvres. It is of no slight significance that\r\nphotographs have been discovered of groups of these young men--some of\r\nwhom were subsequently convicted for serious offences--with Tilak\r\nhimself in their midst. They were in constant communication with Poona,\r\nand when the Poona extremists began to specialize on bombs they were\r\namongst the neophytes of the new cult. A conspiracy was hatched of which\r\nthe admitted purpose was to murder Colonel Ferris, the Political Agent,\r\nat the wedding of the Maharajah's daughter on March 21, 1908, but, if it\r\nhad been carried out successfully, the Maharajah himself and many of his\r\nother guests would almost inevitably have been killed at the same time.\r\nFor, as was disclosed in the subsequent trial, a bomb was prepared and\r\ndespatched from Poona which was to have been hurled into the wedding\r\n_pandal_ or enclosure railed off in the courtyard of the Palace for the\r\nMaharajah and his family and the principal guests, including Colonel\r\nFerris. Fortunately the bomb, which was subsequently discovered, did not\r\nreach Kolhapur in time. The conspirators had to fall back upon less\r\npotent weapons. Thanks to the Arms Act, which is one of the favourite\r\ngrievances of Indian Nationalism, they had great difficulty in obtaining\r\narms, but they secured a few, and on April 16, 1908, when Colonel\r\nFerris, who was retiring, left Kolhapur, some of the conspirators\r\nfollowed him into the train, and, alighting at one of the stations,\r\nattempted to shoot him, but, again fortunately, their cartridges missed\r\nfire. A few weeks later placards giving formulae for the making of bombs\r\nwere actually posted up on the doors of schools and other buildings, and\r\nthis was followed by a theft of dangerous chemicals from a Kolhapur\r\nprivate school. Finally ten youths, nine of whom were Brahmans, were\r\ncommitted for trial on these offences before a special Sessions Judge,\r\nlent by Government, and eight of them were convicted.\r\n\r\nQuite as much as these convictions the downfall of Tilak helped to quell\r\nthe forces of unrest in the State of Kolhapur as well as in the rest of\r\nthe Deccan. For in Kolhapur, as in Poona, it was the Brahman Press\r\ncontrolled by Tilak that familiarized the rising generation with the\r\nidea of political murder. In the year which preceded the Kolhapur\r\nconspiracy, and just after the first dastardly bomb outrage at\r\nMuzafferpur to which Mrs. and Miss Kennedy fell victims, an article\r\nappeared in the _Vishvavritta_, a Kolhapur monthly magazine, for which\r\nits editor, Mr. Bijapurkar, a Brahman, who until 1905 had been Professor\r\nof Sanscrit at the Rajaram College, was subsequently prosecuted and\r\nconvicted. The article, which was significantly headed \"The potency of\r\nVedic prayers,\" recalled various cases in which the Vedas lay down the\r\nduty of retaliation upon \"alien\" oppressors. \"To kill such people\r\ninvolves no sin, and when Kshatriyas and Vaidhyas do not come forward to\r\nkill them, Brahmans should take up arms and protect religion. When one\r\nis face to face with such people they should be slaughtered without\r\nhesitation. Not the slightest blame attaches to the slayer.\" Moreover,\r\nlest these exhortations should be construed merely as a philosophic\r\ntreatise on Vedic teaching, the writer was careful to add that \"these\r\ndoctrines are not to be kept in books, but must be taught even to babes\r\nand sucklings.\"\r\n\r\nThus in a Native State of the Deccan, just as in British-administered\r\nDeccan, we find the same methods and the same doctrines adopted by the\r\nBrahmans, with the same demoralizing results, in pursuance of the same\r\npurpose, now under one guise and now under another, the maintenance or\r\nrestoration of their own theocratic power, whether it be threatened by a\r\nHindu ruler of their own race, or by \"alien\" rulers and the \"alien\"\r\ncivilization for which they stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBENGAL BEFORE THE PARTITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry in every sense from the Deccan to Bengal. There is a\r\ngreater diversity of races, languages, social customs, physical\r\nconditions, &c., between the different provinces of India than is often\r\nto be found between the different countries of Europe. Few differ more\r\nwidely than the Deccan and Bengal--the Deccan, a great table-land raised\r\non an average over 2,000ft. above sea level, broken by many deep-cut\r\nriver valleys and throwing up lofty ridges of bare rock, entirely\r\ndependent for its rainfall upon the south-west monsoon, which alone and\r\nin varying degrees of abundancy relieves the thirst of a thin soil\r\nparched during the rest of the year by a fierce dry heat--Bengal, a vast\r\nalluvial plain, with a hot, damp climate, watered and fertilized by\r\ngreat rivers like the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, which drain the\r\ngreater part of the Himalayas. The Deccan is thinly populated; it has no\r\ngreat waterways; there are few large cities and few natural facilities\r\nof communication between them, but the population, chiefly Mahratta\r\nHindus, with a fair sprinkling of Mahomedans, survivors of the Moghul\r\nEmpire, are a virile race, wiry rather than sturdy, with tenacious\r\ncustoms and traditions and a language--Marathi--which has a copious\r\npopular literature. Maharashtra, moreover, has historical traditions, by\r\nno means inglorious, of its own. It has played, and is conscious of\r\nhaving played, a conspicuous part in the history of India down to\r\nrelatively recent times; and the Brahmans of Maharashtra, who were once\r\nits rulers, have preserved to the present day the instincts and the\r\naspirations of a ruling race, combined with great force and subtleness\r\nof intellect. In Bengal, on the other hand, there is a dense population,\r\nconcentrated in part in large towns and cities along the great\r\nwaterways, but also spread over the whole surface of the rich plains and\r\ndeltas. The Bengalees are a quick-witted, imaginative, and warm-hearted\r\npeople who have been the victims rather than the makers of history. The\r\ntide of conquest has swept over them again and again from times\r\nimmemorial, but generally without leaving any lasting impression upon\r\ntheir elastic and rather timid temperament. With all his receptive\r\nqualities, his love of novelty and readiness to learn, his retentive\r\nmemory, his luxuriant imagination, his gift of facile eloquence, the\r\nBengalee has seldom shown himself to be a born ruler of men.\r\n\r\nAll these differences are reflected in the unrest in Bengal, though on\r\nthe surface it presents a close resemblance to the unrest in the Deccan,\r\nand there have been constant contact and co-operation between the\r\nleaders. Except as a geographical expression, Bengal is practically a\r\ncreation of British rule and of Western education. The claim of the\r\nmodern Bengalees to be regarded as a \"nation\" has no historical basis.\r\nThe inhabitants of Bengal are of mixed Dravidian, Mongolian, and Aryan\r\norigin, and in no other speech of India, writes Sir H. Risley, is the\r\nliterary language cultivated by the educated classes more widely\r\ndivorced, not only from the many popular dialects spoken in the\r\nprovince, but from that of ordinary conversation. Literary Bengalee is\r\nnot even an altogether indigenous growth. It owes its birth mainly to\r\nthe labours of English missionaries, like Carey, in the first half of\r\nthe last century, assisted by the Pundits of Calcutta. Yet it is upon\r\nthis community of language that the Bengalees mainly found their claim\r\nto recognition as a \"nation\"; or, to put it in another form, their claim\r\nrests upon education as they understand it--i.e., upon the high\r\nproportion of literacy that exists in Bengal as compared with most parts\r\nof India. Education is unquestionably a power in Bengal. It has not\r\nsuperseded caste, which in all essentials is still unbroken, but it has\r\nto some extent overshadowed it.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmans of Bengal have never within historical times been a\r\npolitically dominant force. They did not condescend to take office even\r\nin the remote days when there were Hindu Kings in Bengal, and still less\r\nunder Mahomedan rule. They were content to be learned in Sanscrit and in\r\nthe Hindu Scriptures, and they left secular knowledge to the Kayasthas,\r\nor writer caste, with whom they preserved, notwithstanding certain rigid\r\nbarriers, much more intimate relations than usually exist between\r\ndifferent Hindu castes. There is a tradition that the highest Brahman\r\nsepts of Bengal are the descendants of five priests of special sanctity\r\nwhom King Adisur of Eastern Bengal in the ninth century attracted to his\r\nCourt from the holiest centres of Hinduism, and that the servants who\r\naccompanied them founded the septs to which precedence is still accorded\r\namongst the Kayasthas of Bengal, and both have been at pains to preserve\r\nthe purity of their descent by a most exclusive and complicated, and\r\noften unsavoury, system of matrimonial alliances known as Kulinism.\r\nHence in Bengal the Brahmans share their social primacy to an extent\r\nunknown in other parts of India with the Kayasthas, and also with\r\nanother high caste, the Vaidhyas, who formerly monopolized the practice\r\nof Hindu medicine. The _nexus_ is education, and that _nexus_ has been\r\nstrengthened since the advent of British rule and of Western education.\r\nWhen the educational enterprise of the early British missionaries was\r\nfollowed up, under the impulse of Dr. Duff, the greatest figure in the\r\nmissionary annals of India, and of Ram Mohun Roy, the most learned and\r\nearnest of all reforming Brahmans, by the famous Government Minute of\r\nMarch 7, 1835, many distinguished members of all these three castes\r\nresponded to the call and began to qualify for employment under\r\nGovernment and for the liberal professions that were opening out in the\r\nnew India we were making. They were first in the field, and, though\r\nother castes have followed suit, it is they who have practically\r\nmonopolized the public offices, the Bar, the Press, and the teaching\r\nprofession. It was they who were the moving spirits of the Brahmo Samaj\r\nand of Social Reform when progressive ideas seemed to be on the point of\r\npermeating Hinduism. But when the reaction came which first found public\r\nexpression in the resistance provoked by the Age of Consent Act of 1891\r\nfor mitigating the evils of Hindu child marriage, and the spirit of\r\nreform was deflected from the social and religious into the political\r\ndomain, it was they again who showed the most aptitude to clothe the new\r\npolitical movement in all the forms of Western political activities. It\r\nwas Mr. W.O. Bonnerjee, an able Bengalee lawyer of moderate and\r\nenlightened views, who presided over the first Indian National Congress\r\nat Bombay and delivered an opening address of which the moderation has\r\nrarely been emulated, and though the Congress movement originated in\r\nBombay rather than in Bengal, the fluent spokesmen of Bengal very soon\r\nhad the satisfaction of feeling that for the first time in Indian\r\nhistory Bengal might claim to be marching in the van.\r\n\r\nOwing to his greater plasticity and imagination, the Bengalee has\r\ncertainly often assimilated English ideas as few other Indians have.\r\nNone can question, for instance, the genuine Western culture and sound\r\nlearning of men like Dr. Ashutosh Mookerjee, the Vice-Chancellor of the\r\nCalcutta University, or Dr. Rash Behari Ghose, than whom the English Bar\r\nitself has produced few greater lawyers; and it would be easy to quote\r\nmany other names of scarcely less distinction amongst the many highly\r\neducated Bengalees who have served and are still serving the State with\r\nundoubted loyalty and ability. With the spread of English education,\r\nhabits of tolerance have grown up, at any rate as to externals; and\r\nthough on the crucial point of inter-marriage caste law has lost hardly\r\nanything of its rigidity, religion, in the ordinary intercourse of life,\r\nseems to sit almost as lightly upon educated Hindu society in Calcutta\r\nas upon English society in London. Another result of English education,\r\ncombined with the absence of such traditions of Brahman supremacy as are\r\nstill recent and powerful in the Deccan, has been to invest the\r\npolitical aspirations of the Bengalees with that democratic tinge which\r\nhas won the sympathies of English Radicals; and, even if the tinge in\r\nmost cases be very slight, the Bengalee's own adaptability enables him\r\nto clothe his opinions with extraordinary skill and verisimilitude in\r\nthe form which he intuitively knows will best suit an English audience.\r\nOf any real democratic spirit amongst the educated classes of Bengal it\r\nis difficult to find a trace, for they are separated from the masses\r\nwhom they profess to represent by a social gulf which only a few of the\r\nmost enlightened amongst them have so far even recognized the necessity\r\nof making some attempt to bridge if they wish to give the slightest\r\nplausibility to their professions. It would be less far-fetched, though\r\nthe analogy would still be very halting, to compare the position of the\r\nBengalee \"moderates\" with that of the middle classes in England before\r\nthe Reform Bill of 1832, who had no idea of emancipating the masses, but\r\nonly of emancipating themselves to some extent from the control of a\r\nclose oligarchy. From this point of view there are undoubtedly, and\r\nespecially amongst the elder generation, many educated Bengalees who are\r\nconvinced that in claiming by political agitation a larger share in the\r\nadministration and government of the country they are merely carrying\r\ninto practice the blameless theories of civic life and political\r\nactivity which their reading of English history has taught them. Their\r\ninfluence, however, has been rapidly undermined by a new and essentially\r\nrevolutionary school, who combine with a spirit of revolt against all\r\nWestern authority a reversion to some of the most reactionary\r\nconceptions of authority that the East has ever produced, and,\r\nunfortunately, it is this new school which has now got hold of the\r\nyounger educated classes.\r\n\r\nEducation, to which in its more primitive forms the Bengalees owed\r\nwhatever influence they retained under Mahomedan rule, has given them\r\nunder British rule far larger opportunities which they have turned to\r\naccount with no mean measure of success. I must reserve the thorny\r\nquestion of education for separate treatment. All I need say for the\r\npresent is that, had it grown less instead of more superficial, had it\r\nbeen less divorced from discipline and moral training as well as from\r\nthe realities of Indian life, the results might have been very\r\ndifferent. As it is, in the form given to it in our Indian schools and\r\ncolleges, which have been allowed to drift more and more into native\r\nhands, English education has steadily deteriorated in quality as the\r\noutput has increased in quantity. The sacrifices made by many Bengalees\r\nin humble circumstances to procure for their sons the advantages of what\r\nis called higher education are often pathetic, but the results of this\r\nmania for higher education, however laudable in itself, have been\r\ndisastrous. Every year large batches of youths with a mere smattering of\r\nknowledge are turned out into a world that has little or no use for\r\nthem. Soured on the one hand by their own failure, or by the failure of\r\nsuch examinations as they may have succeeded in passing to secure for\r\nthem the employment to which they aspired, and scorning the sort of work\r\nto which they would otherwise have been trained, they are ripe for every\r\nrevolt. That is the material upon which the leaders of unrest have most\r\nsuccessfully worked, and it is only recently that some of the more\r\nsober-minded Bengalees of the older generation have begun to realize the\r\ndangers inherent in such a system. When in 1903 Lord Curzon brought in\r\nhis Universities Bill to mitigate some of the most glaring evils of the\r\nsystem, there was a loud and unanimous outcry in Bengal that Government\r\nintended to throttle higher education because it was education that was\r\nmaking a \"nation\" of Bengal. Subsequent events have shown that that\r\nmeasure was not only urgently needed, but that it came too late to cure\r\nthe mischief already done, and was, if anything, too circumscribed in\r\nits scope. The storm it raised was intensified shortly afterwards by\r\nLord Curzon's famous Convocation speech, into which the sensitive and\r\nemotional Bengalee hastened to read a humiliating indictment of the\r\n\"nation.\" Such a storm showed how heavily laden was the atmosphere with\r\ndangerous electricity.\r\n\r\nFor some years past the influence of Tilak and his irreconcilable school\r\nhad been projected from the Deccan into Bengal, and nowhere did it make\r\nitself so rapidly felt as in the Press. The _Calcutta Review_ has been\r\npublishing a very instructive history of the Indian Press by Mr. S.C.\r\nSanial, a Hindu scholar who has had the advantage of consulting\r\nauthentic and hitherto unpublished documents. His erudite work shows how\r\nthe native Press of India first grew up in Bengal as the direct product\r\nof English education, and faithfully reflected all the fluctuations of\r\neducated Bengalee opinion, many of the most influential native\r\nnewspapers continuing to be published in English, side by side with, and\r\noften under the same control as, more popular papers published in the\r\nvernacular. Among the \"advanced\" journalists of Bengal, none had fallen\r\nso entirely under the spell of Tilak's magnetic personality as Mr. Bepin\r\nChandra Pal and Mr. Arabindo Ghose, and the former's _New India_ and the\r\nlatter's _Bande_ also published in English, soon outstripped the\r\naggressiveness of Mr. Surendranath Banerjee's _Bengalee_. For though\r\nnot immune from the reaction against Western influences and in favour of\r\nHinduism as a religious and social system, the school represented by Mr.\r\nBanerjee confined itself at first mainly to political agitation and to\r\ncriticism of British methods of administration. The new school\r\nrepresented, perhaps most conspicuously, by Mr. Arabindo Ghose scarcely\r\ndisguised its hostility to British rule itself and to all that British\r\nascendancy stands for. Hinduism for the Hindus, or, as they preferred to\r\nput it, \"Arya for the Aryans,\" was the war-cry of zealots, half\r\nfanatics, half patriots, whose mysticism found in the sacred story of\r\nthe _Bhagvat Gita_ not only the charter of Indian independence but the\r\nsanctification of the most violent means for the overthrow of an alien\r\nrule. With this \"Aryan\" reaction, having to a great extent the force of\r\nreligious enthusiasm behind it, orthodoxy also recovered ground, and\r\nBrahmanism was not slow to show how potent it still is even in Bengal\r\nwhen it appeals to the superstitions of the masses. In one form or\r\nanother this spirit had spread like wildfire not only among the students\r\nbut among the teachers, and the schools of physical training to which\r\nyoung Bengal had taken, partly under the influence of our British love\r\nof sports and partly from a legitimate desire to remove from their\r\n\"nation\" the stigma of unmanliness, were rapidly transforming themselves\r\ninto political societies modelled upon the bands of gymnasts which\r\nfigured so prominently in Tilak's propaganda in the Deccan. Among the\r\nolder men, some yielded to the new spirit from fear of being elbowed out\r\nby their youngers, some were genuinely impatient of the tardiness of the\r\nconstitutional reforms for which they had looked to the agency of the\r\nIndian National Congress; a few perhaps welcomed the opportunity of\r\nventing the bitterness engendered by social slights, real or imaginary,\r\nor by disappointments in Government service.\r\n\r\nSuch appears to have been the _état d'âme_ of Bengal when the\r\nGovernment of India promulgated the measure of administrative\r\nredistribution known as the Partition of Bengal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE STORM IN BENGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe merits or demerits of the Partition of Bengal have already been\r\ndiscussed to satiety. As far as its purpose was to promote\r\nadministrative efficiency it is no longer on its defence. Bengal proper\r\nis still the most populous province in India, but it has been brought\r\nwithin limits that at least make efficient administration practicable.\r\nThe eastern districts, now included in the new province, which had been\r\nhitherto lamentably neglected, have already gained enormously by the\r\nchange, which was at the same time only an act of justice to the large\r\nMahomedan majority who received but scanty consideration from Calcutta.\r\nThe only people who perhaps suffered inconvenience or material loss were\r\nabsentee landlords, pleaders, and moneylenders, and some of the\r\nmerchants of Calcutta, Anglo-Indian as well as native, who believed\r\ntheir interests to be affected by the transfer of the seat of provincial\r\ngovernment for the Eastern Bengal districts to Dacca. Nevertheless the\r\nPartition was the signal for an agitation such as India had not hitherto\r\nwitnessed. I say advisedly the signal rather than the cause. For if the\r\nPartition in itself had sufficed to rouse spontaneous popular feeling,\r\nit would have been unnecessary for the leaders of the agitation to\r\nresort in the rural districts to gross misrepresentations of the objects\r\nof that measure. What all the smouldering discontent, all the\r\nreactionary disaffection centred in Calcutta read into the Partition was\r\na direct attack upon the primacy of the educated classes that had made\r\nCalcutta the capital of the Bengalee \"nation.\" The Universities Act of\r\n1904, it was alleged, had been the first attempt on the part of a\r\nmasterful Viceroy to reduce their influence by curtailing their control\r\nof higher education. Partition was a further attempt to hamper their\r\nactivities by cutting half the \"nation\" adrift from its \"intellectual\"\r\ncapital. This was a cry well calculated to appeal to many \"moderates,\"\r\nwhom the merely political aspects of the question would have left\r\nrelatively unmoved and it certainly proved effective, for in Calcutta\r\nfeeling ran very strong. Whilst \"monster\" demonstrations were organized\r\nin Calcutta and in the principal towns of the _mofussil_, the wildest\r\nreports were sedulously disseminated amongst the rural population.\r\nPartition was meant to pave the way for undoing the Permanent Settlement\r\nwhich governs the Land Revenue in Bengal, and, once the Permanent\r\nSettlement out of the way, Government would screw up the land tax. As\r\nfor the creation of the new province, it was intended to facilitate the\r\ncompulsory emigration of the people from the plains, who would be driven\r\nto work on the Englishmen's tea plantations in the far-off jungles of\r\nAssam. Reports of this kind were well calculated to alarm both the\r\n_Zemindars_, who had waxed fat on the Permanent Settlement, and the\r\ncredulous _rayats_, whose labour is indispensable to the _zemindar_\r\nsquirarchy. In the towns, on the other hand, the masses were told that\r\nPartition was an insult to the \"terrible goddess\" Kali, the most popular\r\nof all Hindu deities in Bengal, and, in order to popularize the protest\r\namongst the small townsfolk, amongst artisans and petty traders, the cry\r\nof _Swadeshi_ was coupled with that of _Bande Mataram_.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of revolt against Western political authority had been for\r\nsome time past spreading to the domain of economics. _Swadeshi_ in\r\nitself and so far as it means the intelligent encouragement of\r\nindigenous is perfectly legitimate, and in this sense the Government of\r\nIndia had practised _Swadeshi_ long before it was taken up for purposes\r\nof political agitation by those who look upon it primarily as an\r\neconomic weapon against their rulers. It was now to receive a formidable\r\ndevelopment. _Swadeshi_ must strike at the flinty heart of the British\r\npeople by cutting off the demand for British manufactured goods and\r\nsubstituting in their place the products of native labour. At the first\r\ngreat meeting held at the Calcutta Town Hall to protest against\r\nPartition, the building was to have been draped in black as a sign of\r\n\"national\" mourning, but the idea was ostentatiously renounced because\r\nthe only materials available were of English manufacture. Not only did\r\nthe painful circumstances of the hour forbid any self-respecting\r\nBengalee from using foreign-made articles, but some means had to be\r\nfound of compelling the lukewarm to take the same lofty view of their\r\nduties. So the cry of boycott was raised, and it is worth noting, as\r\nevidence of the close contact and co-operation between the forces of\r\nunrest in the Deccan and in Bengal, that at the same time as it was\r\nraised in Calcutta by Mr. Surendranath Banerjee it was raised also at\r\nPoona by Tilak who perhaps foresaw much more clearly the lawlessness to\r\nwhich it would lead. For, though the cry fell on deaf ears in Bombay,\r\nthe boycott did not remain by any means an idle threat in Bengal. The\r\nmovement was placed under the special patronage of Kali and vows were\r\nadministered to large crowds in the forecourts of her great temple at\r\nCalcutta and in her various shrines all over Bengal. The religious\r\ncharacter with which the leaders sought to invest the boycott propaganda\r\nshowed how far removed was the _swadeshi_ which they preached from a\r\nmere innocent economic propaganda for the furtherance of native\r\nindustries. For a description of the Tantric rites connected with\r\n_Shakti_ worship I must refer readers to M. Barth's learned work on \"The\r\nreligions of India,\" of which an English translation has been published\r\nby Messrs Trübner in their Oriental series. In its extreme forms\r\n_Shakti_ worship finds expression in licentious aberrations which,\r\nhowever lofty may be the speculative theories that gave birth to them,\r\nrepresent the most extravagant forms of delirious mysticism. Yet such\r\nmen as Mr. Surendranath Banerjee[7], who in his relations with\r\nEnglishmen claims to represent the fine flower of Western education and\r\nHindu enlightenment, did not hesitate to call the popularity of _Shakti_\r\nworship in aid in order to stimulate the boycott of British goods. To\r\nprevent any blacksliding the agitators had ready to hand an organization\r\nwhich they did not hesitate to use. The gymnastic societies founded in\r\nBengal for physical training and semi-military drill on the model of\r\nthose established by Tilak in the Deccan were transformed into bands of\r\n_samitis_ or \"national volunteers,\" and students and schoolboys who had\r\nbeen encouraged from the first to take part in public meetings and to\r\nparade the streets in procession as a protest against Partition, were\r\nmobilized to picket the bazaars and enforce the boycott. Nor were their\r\nmethods confined to moral suasion. Where it failed they were quite ready\r\nto use force. The Hindu leaders had made desperate attempts to enlist\r\nthe support of the Mahomedans, and not without some success, until the\r\nlatter began to realize the true meaning both of the Partition and of\r\nthe agitation against it. Nothing was better calculated to enlighten\r\nthem than another feature introduced also from the Deccan into the\r\n\"national\" propaganda. In the Deccan the cult of Shivaji, as the epic\r\nhero of Mahratta history, was intelligible enough. But in Bengal his\r\nname had been for generations a bogey with which mothers hushed their\r\nbabies, and the Mahratta Ditch in Calcutta still bears witness to the\r\nterror produced by the daring raids of Mahratta horsemen. To set Shivaji\r\nup in Bengal on the pedestal of Nationalism in the face of such\r\ntraditions was no slight feat, and all Mr. Surendranath Banerjee's\r\npopularity barely availed to perform it successfully. But to identify\r\nthe cause of Nationalism with the cult of the Mahratta warrior-king who\r\nhad first arrested the victorious career and humbled the pride of the\r\nMahomedan conquerors of Hindustan was not the way to win over to it the\r\nMahomedans of Bengal. In Eastern Bengal especially, with the exception\r\nof a few landlords and pleaders whose interests were largely bound up\r\nwith those of the Hindus, the Mahomedans as a community had everything\r\nto gain and nothing to lose by the Partition. For those amongst them who\r\nwere merchants the boycott spelt serious injury to their trade and led\r\nin some instances to reprisals in which the Hindus fared badly. Whenever\r\nit happened in this way that the biter was bit, the Bengalee Press\r\naccused the Government of encouraging the revival of sectarian strife,\r\njust as it denounced every measure for the maintenance of order which\r\nthe Government was compelled to take in the discharge of one of its most\r\nelementary duties, as brutal repression and arbitrary vindictiveness,\r\nand any mistake of procedure made by some subordinate official under the\r\nstress of a very critical situation was distorted and magnified into a\r\ngross denial of justice. But it was out of the punishments very properly\r\ninflicted upon the misguided schoolboys and students whom the\r\npoliticians had put in the forefront of the fray that the greatest\r\ncapital was made. Whilst the politicians themselves prudently remained\r\nfor the most part in Calcutta, making high-sounding speeches and writing\r\ninflammatory articles, or were careful in their own overt demonstrations\r\nnot to overstep the extreme bounds of legality, they showered telegrams\r\nand letters of congratulation on the young \"martyrs\" who had been duly\r\ncastigated.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the movement had also another string to their bow which\r\nthey used with considerable effect. Never before had there been such\r\nclose contact between Indian politicians and certain groups of English\r\npoliticians. Lord Curzon's fall and the extremely injudicious\r\nreferences to Partition made by Mr. Brodrick, the then Secretary of\r\nState, in the correspondence published after the resignation of the\r\nViceroy, had from the first given a great stimulus to the anti-Partition\r\ncampaign, Mr. Brodrick's remarks led the Bengalees to form a very\r\nexaggerated estimate of the personal part played by Lord Curzon in the\r\nquestion of Partition, and they not unnaturally concluded that, if the\r\nSecretary of State had merely sanctioned the Partition in order to\r\nhumour the Viceroy, he might easily be induced to reconsider the matter\r\nwhen once Lord Curzon had been got out of the way. Their hopes in that\r\nquarter were, it is true, very soon dashed, but only to be strung up\r\nagain to the highest pitch of expectancy when the Conservative\r\nGovernment fell from power, and was replaced by a Liberal\r\nAdministration, with Mr. John Morley at the India Office and an\r\noverwhelming majority in the House of Commons, in which the Radical\r\nelement was very strongly represented. Several of the leading Radical\r\norgans in England had for a long time past joined hands with the\r\nBengalee Press in denouncing Lord Curzon and all his works, and, most\r\nfiercely of all, the Partition of Bengal. The Bengalee politicians,\r\nmoreover, not only had the active sympathy of a large section of Radical\r\nopinion at home, but they had in the House itself the constant\r\nco-operation of a small but energetic group of members, who constituted\r\nthemselves into an \"Indian party,\" and were ever ready to act as the\r\nspokesmen of Indian discontent. Some of them were of that earnest type\r\nof self-righteousness which loves to smell out unrighteousness in their\r\nfellow countrymen, especially in those who are serving their country\r\nabroad; some were hypnotized by the old shibboleths of freedom, even\r\nwhen freedom merely stands for licence; some were retired Anglo-Indians,\r\nwhose experience in the public service in India would have carried\r\ngreater weight had not the peculiar acerbity of their language seemed to\r\nbetray the bitterness of personal disappointment. Every invention or\r\nexaggeration of the Bengalee Press found its way into the list of\r\nquestions to be asked of the Secretary of State, who, with less\r\nknowledge than he has since acquired, doubtless considered himself bound\r\nto pass them on for inquiry to the Government of India. A large\r\nproportion of these questions were aimed at Sir Bampfylde Fuller, who,\r\nas the first Lieutenant-Governor of the new province of Eastern Bengal,\r\nhad been singled out for every form of vituperation and calumny, and no\r\nsubject figured more prominently amongst them than the disciplinary\r\ntreatment of turbulent schoolboys and students. It is so easy to appeal\r\nto the generous sentiments of the British public in favour of poor boys,\r\nsupposed to be of tender years, dragged into police courts by harsh\r\nbureaucrats for some hasty action prompted by the generous, if foolish,\r\nexuberance of youth, especially when the British public is quite unaware\r\nthat in India most students and many schoolboys are more or less\r\nfull-grown and often already married. Every one of these questions was\r\nduly advertised in the columns of the Bengalee Press, and their\r\ncumulative effect was to produce the impression that the British\r\nParliament was following events in Bengal with feverish interest and\r\nwith overwhelming sympathy for the poor oppressed Bengalee.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there came a moment when the first feverish excitement\r\nseemed to wane. Time had gone on, and though there was a new Viceroy in\r\nIndia and a new Secretary of State at Whitehall, the Partition had\r\nremained an accomplished fact. The visit of the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales to Calcutta had temporarily exercised a restraining influence on\r\nthe political leaders, and the presence of Royalty in a country where\r\nreverence for the Throne is still a powerful tradition seemed to hush\r\neven the forces of militant sedition. In Eastern Bengal, where the\r\nagitation had been much fiercer than in Bengal proper, the energy and\r\ndevotion displayed by the Lieutenant-Governor in fighting a serious\r\nthreat of famine had won for him the respect of many of his opponents,\r\nand the situation was beginning to lose some of its acuteness when it\r\nwas suddenly announced that Sir Bampfylde Fuller had resigned. The\r\neffect was instantaneous. The points at issue between Sir Bampfylde\r\nFuller and the Government of India have been fully and frequently\r\ndebated, and it is needless to discuss here the reasons given for his\r\nresignation, or for its prompt acceptance by the Viceroy. What I am\r\nconcerned with is the effect produced by that incident. It was immediate\r\nand disastrous. The Bengalee leaders took heart. They claimed Sir\r\nBampfylde's downfall as their triumph--theirs and their allies' at\r\nWestminster. Those, on the other hand, who imagined that it was Sir\r\nBampfylde's methods that had intensified the agitation and that his\r\nremoval would restore peace--even the sort of half peace which had been\r\nso far maintained in Bengal proper under the milder sway of Sir Andrew\r\nFraser--were very soon undeceived. For if for a short time Sir Bampfylde\r\nFuller's successor was spared, the Government of Eastern Bengal was\r\ncompelled before long to take, more vigorous measures than he had ever\r\ncontemplated, and the agitation, which had hitherto refrained from\r\nexhibiting its more violent aspects in Bengal proper, not only ceased to\r\nshow any discrimination, but everywhere broadened and deepened. The\r\nveteran leaders, who still posed as \"moderates,\" ceased to lead or,\r\nswept away by the forces they had helped to raise, were compelled to\r\nquicken their pace like the Communist leader in Paris who rushed after\r\nhis men exclaiming:--_Je suis leur chef, il faut bien que je les suive_.\r\nThe question of Partition itself receded into the background, and the\r\nissue, until then successfully veiled and now openly raised, was not\r\nwhether Bengal should be one unpartitioned province or two partitioned\r\nprovinces under British rule, but whether British rule itself was to\r\nendure in Bengal or, for the matter of that, anywhere in India.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of unrest in Bengal, at any rate in its outward\r\nmanifestations, had been mainly political, and on the whole free from\r\nany open exhibition of disloyalty to the British _Raj_. With the\r\nPartition of Bengal it passed into a second phase in which, new economic\r\nissues were superadded to the political issues, if they did not\r\naltogether overshadow them, and the _Swadeshi_ movement and the boycott\r\nsoon imported methods of violence and lawlessness which had hitherto\r\nbeen considered foreign to the Bengalee temperament. This phase did not\r\nlast for much more than a year after the Partition, for, when once\r\nstarted on the inclined plane of lawlessness, the agitation rapidly\r\ndeveloped into a much wider and deeper revolt, in which _Swadeshi_ held\r\nits place, but only in a subordinate position. The revolt began rapidly\r\nto assume the revolutionary complexion, in the religious and social as\r\nwell as in the political domain, which Tilak had for years past, as we\r\nhave seen, laboured to impart to his propaganda in the Deccan, and, as\r\nfar as his personal influence and counsels availed, in every part of\r\nIndia with which he was in contact. The ground had already been prepared\r\nfor this transformation by spadework in the Bengalee Press conducted by\r\ntwo of Tilak's chief disciples in Bengal. One was Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal,\r\nthe bold exponent of _Swaraj_, whose programme I have already quoted.\r\nThe other was Mr. Arabindo Ghose, one of the most remarkable figures\r\nthat Indian unrest has produced. Educated in England, and so thoroughly\r\nthat when he returned to India he found it difficult to express himself\r\nin Bengali, he is not only a high-caste Hindu, but he is one of those\r\nHindu mystics who believe that, by the practice of the most extreme\r\nforms of _Yoga_ asceticism, man can transform himself into a super-man,\r\nand he has constituted himself the high priest of a religious revival\r\nwhich has taken a profound hold on the imagination of the emotional\r\nyouth of Bengal. His ethical gospel is not devoid of grandeur. It is\r\nbased mainly on the teachings of Krishna to Arjuna as revealed in the\r\n_Bhagvad Gita_, and I cannot hope to define its moral purpose better\r\nthan by borrowing the following sentence from Mrs. Besant's introduction\r\nto her translation of \"The Lord's Song\":--\r\n\r\n   It is meant to lift the aspirant from the lower levels of\r\n   renunciation where objects are renounced, to the loftier\r\n   heights where desires are dead and where the Yogi dwells\r\n   in calm and ceaseless contemplation, while his body and\r\n   mind are actively employed in discharging the duties that\r\n   fall to his lot in life.\r\n\r\nThis reading of the _Bhagvad Gita_ differentiates the newer Indian\r\nconception of renunciation, which does not exclude but rather prescribes\r\nthe duty of service to society, from the older conception, which was\r\nconcerned merely to procure the salvation of the individual by his\r\ncomplete detachment from all mundane affairs. With this gospel of active\r\nself-sacrifice none can assuredly quarrel, but it is the revolutionary\r\nform which Mr. Arabindo Ghose would see given to such activity that,\r\nunfortunately, chiefly fascinates the rising generation of Bengalees.\r\nFor him British rule and the Western civilization for which it stands\r\nthreaten the very life of Hinduism, and therefore British rule and all\r\nthat it stands for must go, and in order that they may go every Hindu\r\nmust be up and doing. That Mr. Arabindo Ghose himself holds violence and\r\nmurder to be justifiable forms of activity for achieving that purpose\r\ncannot be properly alleged, for though he has several times been placed\r\non his trial and in one instance for actual complicity in political\r\ncrime--namely, in the Maniktolla bomb case--and though he is at present\r\na fugitive from justice, the law has so far acquitted him. But that his\r\nfollowers have based upon his teachings a propaganda by deed of the most\r\ndesperate character is beyond dispute. It has been openly expounded with\r\nfanatical fervour and pitiless logic in a newspaper edited by his\r\nbrother, Barendra Ghose, of which the file constitutes one of the most\r\nvaluable and curious of human documents.\r\n\r\nOf the three Bengali newspapers that came into the field soon after\r\nPartition as the explicit champions of revolution--- the _Sandhya_, the\r\n_Navasakti_, to which Mr. Arabindo Ghose was himself a frequent\r\ncontributor, and the _Yugantar_--the last named achieved the greatest\r\nand most startling popularity. It was founded in 1906 by Barendra Kumar\r\nGhose, a brother of Arabindo, and by Bhupendranath Dutt, only brother of\r\nthe celebrated Swami Vivekananda, who visited Europe and America as the\r\nmissionary of the Hindu revival and has been revered in India, since his\r\npremature death in 1905, as a modern _rishi_ and a no less great one\r\nthan those of ancient Vedic times. Barendra Ghose, who had studied\r\nhistory and political literature at Baroda, where Arabindo was a\r\nProfessor in the Gaekwar's College, had originally intended to start a\r\nreligious institution, and whilst he edited the _Yugantar_ he founded a\r\nhostel for youths attending \"National\" schools. The _Yugantar_ set\r\nitself to preach revolution as a religious even more than a political\r\nmovement. Its profession of faith is to be found in an article headed\r\n\"The Age of the Gita again in India\":--\r\n\r\n   God (i.e., Khrisna in the Gita) has said, \"Oh, descendant\r\n   of Bharata, whenever there be a decline of righteousness and\r\n   the rise of unrighteousness, then I shall become incarnate\r\n   again. I shall be born in every Yuga [era] to rescue the good,\r\n   to destroy the wrongdoer, and to establish righteousness.\"\r\n\r\n   In the _Dwapara-Yuga_ [the era which preceded the present\r\n   _Kali-Yuga_, or era of darkness] when righteousness was on\r\n   the wane and unrighteousness was springing up in the sacred\r\n   land of India under the hands of Duryyodhana and other\r\n   miscreants engaged in wickedness, then God, by becoming\r\n   incarnate again and awakening his favourite disciple Arjuna\r\n   to duty, re-established the kingdom of righteousness in India.\r\n   At the present time righteousness is declining and unrighteousness\r\n   is springing up in India. A handful of alien robbers is\r\n   ruining the crores of the people of India by robbing the wealth\r\n   of India. Through the hard grinding of their servitude,\r\n   the ribs of this countless people are being broken to pieces.\r\n   Endless endeavours are being made in order that this great\r\n   nation by losing, as an inevitable result of this subjection,\r\n   its moral, intellectual and physical power, its wealth, its\r\n   self-reliance, and all other qualities, may be turned into the\r\n   condition of the beasts of burden or be wholly extinguished.\r\n   Why, oh Indians, are you losing heart, at the sight of many\r\n   obstacles in your path, to make a stand against this unrighteousness?\r\n   Fear not, oh Indians. God will not remain\r\n   inactive at the sight of such unrighteousness in His kingdom.\r\n   He will keep His word. Placing firm reliance on the promise\r\n   of God, invoke His power, and He will descend in your midst\r\n   to destroy unrighteousness. Do not be afraid. \"When the\r\n   lightning of heaven flashes in their hearts, men perform\r\n   impossible deeds.\"\r\n\r\nThe article closes with a lyrical vision of the India of the future,\r\nwith \"the independent flag of righteousness\" unfurled, her virtues\r\nrestored, plague and famine banished, her industries brought to the\r\nhighest pitch of scientific development, her armies and fleets going\r\nforth \"to use the unlimited strength, knowledge, and righteousness of\r\nIndia for the benefit of the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Yugantar_ at the same time set forth in a series of articles the\r\nscheme by which the enfranchisement of India was to be achieved--a\r\nscheme which was little more than a reasoned exposition of the methods\r\nalready adopted in the previous decade by Tilak in the Deccan. These\r\narticles form a manual of directions for \"the army of young men which is\r\nthe _Nrisinha_ and the _Varaha_ and the _Kalki_ incarnation of God,\r\nsaving the good and destroying the wicked\"--the _Kalki_ incarnation\r\nbeing that in which Vishnu is to come and deliver India from the\r\nforeigner. To shake off slavery the first essential is that the educated\r\nclasses shall learn to hate slavery. Then the lower classes will soon\r\nfollow their lead. \"It is easy to incite the lower classes to any\r\nparticular work. But the incitement of the educated depends on a firm\r\nbelief.\" Therefore the \"poisonous\" effects of slavery must be constantly\r\nbrought home, and \"we must always be trying to destroy the present\r\nunnatural liking for a state of servitude.\" The aspiration for freedom\r\nmust be converted into a firm resolve, and to divert the Bengalee \"from\r\nthe unfailing attraction of a livelihood\" to the cause of freedom \"his\r\nmind must be excited and maddened by such an ideal as will present to\r\nhim a picture of everlasting salvation.\" Public opinion must be built up\r\nby the newspapers, \"which must be filled with the discussion of the\r\nnecessity of independence and revolution,\" by soul-stirring musical and\r\ntheatrical performances, glorifying the lives of Indian heroes and their\r\ngreat deeds in the cause of freedom, and by patriotic songs. \"When in\r\nthe Mahratta country the high-souled Shivaji stood up for independence\r\nthe songs of the bards helped powerfully in his work.\" Above all, the\r\nmaterials for \"a great sacrifice for liberty\" must be prepared. \"The\r\nstratagems known as resorting to cover in English military tactics are\r\nvery necessary in all political endeavour,\" and \"the enemy\" must be kept\r\nconstantly occupied by them. \"A _Bande Mataram_ procession to-day, a\r\nconference or congress to-morrow, a flourish of _Swadeshi_ speeches the\r\nday after, and so on.\" A \"great commotion may with advantage be made\r\nover small incidents,\" but \"it must always be remembered that these do\r\nnot constitute our real effort, and are very trifling accompaniments\"\r\nwhich serve to keep the enemy busy and the country awake \"whilst we are\r\ntraining,\" and the training consists in the organization, discreetly and\r\nsilently, of bands of young men \"with power to conceal secret counsel\"\r\nand \"to remain under complete obedience.\" Every band must \"recognize the\r\ncultivation of physical strength as a principal means of attaining our\r\nobject.\" Each band, working down from the chief town of the district,\r\nmust be connected with other bands, and all must be initiated in the\r\n_Shakti mantra_--that _Shakti_ worship which constitutes one of the most\r\npowerful and popular appeals to the sensuous side of Hindu mysticism. As\r\nfor arming the bands, there are different ways of collecting arms, and\r\nin this business \"there can be no considerations of right or wrong, for\r\neverything is laid at the feet of the goddess of independence.\" Bombs\r\ncan be manufactured in secret places, and guns can be imported from\r\nforeign countries, for \"the people of the West will sell their own\r\nMotherland for money,\" or they can be obtained from the native troops\r\nwho, \"though driven by hunger to accept service under Government, are\r\nmen of our own flesh and blood,\" or, perhaps, even \"secretly\" from other\r\nGreat Powers. Funds also can be collected in similar ways. Much money is\r\nrequired, and amongst other things for \"secret preachers at home and\r\nabroad.\" It can be obtained \"by voluntary donations,\" or \"by the\r\napplication of force,\" which is perfectly justifiable since the money is\r\nto be taken and used \"for the good of society.\" Thefts and dacoities\r\nare, under normal conditions, crimes because they destroy the sense of\r\nsocial security, but \"to destroy it for the highest good is no sin, but\r\nrather a work of religious merit.\" The taking of blood is, in the\r\ncircumstances, equally praiseworthy. \"The law of the English is\r\nestablished on brute force, and if to liberate ourselves we too must use\r\nbrute force, it is right that we should do so.\" Nor is this doctrine\r\nmerely stated in general terms:--\r\n\r\n   Will the Bengali worshippers of _Shakti_ shrink from the\r\n   shedding of blood? The number of Englishmen in this\r\n   country is not above one lakh and a half, and what is the\r\n   number of English officials in each district? If you are firm\r\n   in your resolution you can in a single day bring English rule\r\n   to an end. Lay down your life, but first take a life. The\r\n   worship of the goddess will not be consummated if you sacrifice\r\n   your lives at the shrine of independence without shedding blood.\r\n\r\nThese are the doctrines of revolutionary Hinduism expounded day by day\r\nfor nearly two years by a group of highly educated young Bengalees, the\r\neffectiveness of whose appeal to sacred traditions was enhanced by\r\nremarkable qualities of style. I have before me a letter from a Hindu\r\nscholar who certainly has no sympathy with the methods advocated by the\r\n_Yugantar_--\"Nothing like these articles ever appeared before in Bengali\r\nliterature.\" \"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,\"\r\nand this was essentially true in the case of the _Yugantar_. The\r\nGovernment translator confessed in the High Court that he had never\r\nbefore read, in Bengali, language so lofty, so pathetic, and so\r\nstirring, that it was impossible to convey it in an English translation.\r\nYet, the writers had never learnt to write Bengali in their school-days,\r\nand the organ tone of Milton, which was distinctly audible in the\r\nBengali, betrayed their English education. The sale was unbounded. The\r\ncirculation of the _Yugantar_ rose to over 50,000, a figure never\r\nattained before by any Indian newspaper, and sometimes when there was a\r\nspecial run upon a number the Calcutta newsboys would get a rupee for a\r\nsingle copy before the issue was exhausted. So great indeed was the\r\ndemand that the principal articles, forming a complete gospel of\r\nrevolution, were republished in a small volume, entitled _Mukti con\r\npathe_: \"Which way does salvation lie?\" Not only were these appeals to\r\nracial and religious passion reflected in many other papers all over\r\nBengal, but the most lamentable fact of all was that scarcely any native\r\npaper, even amongst those of an avowedly moderate complexion, attempted\r\nto counteract, or ventured to protest against, either the matter or the\r\ntone of these publications. Their success, on the other hand, induced\r\nnot a few to follow suit. What is forgotten in England by the\r\nuncompromising champions of the freedom of the Press is that in a\r\ncountry like ours, with its party system fully represented in the public\r\nPress, even the newspapers which either party may consider most\r\nmischievous find their corrective in the newspapers of the other party.\r\nIn India that is not the case. There is no healthy play of public\r\nopinion. The classes whose confidence in the British _Raj_ is still\r\nunshaken are practically unrepresented in the Press, which is mostly in\r\nthe hands of the intellectuals, of whom the majority are drifting into\r\nincreasing estrangement, while the minority are generally too timid to\r\ntry to stem the flowing tide. Nor, if the \"moderates\" in Bengal were\r\noverawed by the violence of the new creed, can the whole blame be laid\r\nupon their shoulders when one remembers how little was being done by\r\nGovernment, and how ineffective that little was to check this\r\nincendiarism. Though there were many Press prosecutions, and action was\r\nrepeatedly taken against the _Yugantar_ in respect of particular\r\narticles, the limited powers possessed by Government were totally\r\ninadequate, and it was not till the Indian Newspapers (Incitement to\r\nOffences) Act was passed in June, 1908, that the _Yugantar_ was\r\nsuppressed. In the meantime it had left an indelible mark on Indian\r\nhistory, and many innocent victims paid with their lives for the\r\nextraordinary supineness displayed during those first disastrous two\r\nyears of Lord Minto's administration.\r\n\r\nThe list of outrages and deeds of violence which had begun in Bengal in\r\n1907 grew heavier and heavier as 1908 wore on, but none perhaps created\r\nsuch a sensation there as the murder of Mrs. and Miss Kennedy, who were\r\nkilled at Muzafferpur on April 30, 1908, by a bomb intended for the\r\nMagistrate, Mr. Kingsford. The bomb had been thrown by a young Bengalee,\r\nKhudiram Bose, and it was the first occasion on which an Indian had used\r\nthis product of modern science with murderous effect. The excitement was\r\nintense. The majority of the Bengalee papers, it is true, were fain to\r\nreprobate or at least to deprecate this particular form of propaganda,\r\nbut such comments were perfunctory, whilst they generally agreed to cast\r\nthe whole responsibility upon an alien Government whose resistance to\r\ntheir \"national\" aspirations goaded impatient patriotism to these\r\nextremes. Even amongst many who did not actually sympathize with the\r\nmurderer there seems to have been a lurking sense of pride that it was a\r\nBengalee who had had the courage to lay down his life in the striking of\r\nsuch a blow. Khudiram Bose at any rate was not \"lily-livered.\" Khudiram\r\nBose at any rate had shown that \"determination\" with the lack of which\r\nthe writers in the _Yugantar_ had so often taunted their fellow-countrymen.\r\nSo for the Nationalists of Bengal he became a martyr and a hero. Students\r\nand many others put on mourning for him and schools were closed for two or\r\nthree days as a tribute to his memory. His photographs had an immense sale,\r\nand by-and-by the young Bengalee bloods took to wearing _dhotis_ with\r\nKhudiram Bose's name woven into the border of the garment.\r\n\r\nBomb explosions followed in quick succession in Calcutta itself, and a\r\nsecret manufacture of explosives was discovered in a suburban garden.\r\nNorendranath Gosain, who had turned approver in this last case, was shot\r\ndead in Alipur Gaol, and a Hindu police-inspector in the streets of\r\nCalcutta. Four attempts made upon the life of the Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nBengal, Sir Andrew Fraser, showed how little effect leniency had upon\r\nthe growing fierceness of the revolutionists. Scarcely a month and often\r\nnot a week passed without adding to the tale of outrages. I need not\r\nrecite them in detail. Perhaps the most significant feature was the\r\ndouble purpose many of them indicated of defeating the detection and\r\npunishment of crime and of striking terror into Indians who ventured to\r\nserve the British, _Raj_[8]. Thus, on February 10, 1909, Mr. Ashutosh\r\nBiswas, the Public Prosecutor and a Hindu of high character and\r\nposition, was shot dead outside the Alipur Police Court, and, in like\r\nmanner nearly a year later, Mr. Shams-ul-Alam, a Mahomedan Inspector of\r\nthe Criminal Investigation Department in the High Court itself of\r\nCalcutta. Sedition was seething over the greater part of both Bengals,\r\nand though the agricultural population remained for the most part\r\nuntouched or indifferent, there were few even of the smaller towns and\r\nlarger villages that were not visited by the missionaries of revolution.\r\n_Swadeshi_ and the boycott were now merely an accompaniment to the\r\ndeeper and more menacing trumpet-call of open revolt, but they helped\r\n\"to keep the country awake\" even where the true spirit of _Swaraj_ had\r\nnot yet been kindled. The _mofussil_ was honeycombed with secret\r\nsocieties, whose daring dacoities served not only to collect the sinews\r\nof war, but to impress the timid and recalcitrant with the powerlessness\r\nof the State to protect them against the midnight raider. Truly the\r\nteachings of the _Yugantar_ were bearing fruit, even to the laying down\r\nof life and the taking of life. Unlike the majority of Bengalee\r\nagitators, the writers in the _Yugantar_, it must be admitted, did not\r\nflinch from the danger of practising what they taught. Most of them came\r\nultimately within the grasp of the Criminal Code, and Barendra Ghose,\r\nwho was arrested in connexion with the manufacture of bombs in the\r\nManiktolla garden, was sentenced to death, though subsequently\r\nreprieved. His brother, Arabindo, on the other hand, though arrested at\r\nthe same time, had the good fortune to be acquitted. The work done by\r\nthe _Yugantar_ lived, nevertheless, after it, and is still living.\r\n\r\nA very heavy responsibility must at the same time attach to those\r\nresponsible both at home and in India for the extraordinary tolerance\r\ntoo long extended to this criminal propaganda. For two whole years it\r\nwas carried on with relative impunity under the very eyes of the\r\nGovernment of India in Calcutta. Month after month they must have seen\r\nits audacity grow in direct proportion to official apathy. They must\r\nhave seen a reign of lawlessness and intimidation spread steadily over a\r\ngreat part of the Metropolitan province. The failure of the ordinary\r\nmachinery of justice to check these crying evils was repeatedly brought\r\nhome to them. Yet it was not until 1908 that the necessity of\r\nexceptional measures to cope with an exceptional situation was tardily\r\nand very reluctantly realized. The Indian Explosive Substances Act and\r\nSummary Justice Act of 1908, together with the Press Act of the same\r\nyear and the more drastic one enacted last February, have at last to\r\nsome extent checked the saturnalia of lawlessness that continued, though\r\nwith signs of abatement, into the beginning of this year. The Press Act\r\nof 1910, especially, seems to have really arrested the poisonous flow\r\nof printer's ink and with it the worst forms of crime to which it\r\nmaddened the feverish blood of Bengal. But some of those who are most\r\nintimately acquainted with the inner workings of the revolutionary\r\nmovement hold strongly that none of these enactments had such an\r\nimmediately sobering effect as the deportation of the nine prominent\r\nBengalees who were arrested at the end of 1908. Such a measure is, I\r\nknow, very repugnant to British traditions and British sentiment, and in\r\nthis particular instance it unfortunately included two men whose\r\ncriminal guilt was subsequently believed not to be altogether beyond\r\ndoubt, though it may well have been argued that by financing and\r\nadministering a dangerous organization such as the _Anusilan Samiti_\r\nthey made themselves responsible for the deeds of its members.\r\nNevertheless, the deportation struck just at that type of agitator whose\r\ninfluence is most pernicious because it is most subtle, and whose\r\nresponsibility is greatest because of his more experienced years and\r\ngreater social position. Such a measure, however, is only warranted in\r\nextreme circumstances and cannot be transformed into indefinite\r\ndetention. The grounds on which Government announced the release of\r\nthese deportees last winter were even more unhappily chosen than the\r\nmoment for the announcement, but the event seems so far to have\r\njustified Lord Minto's confidence, though one of the deported agitators,\r\nPulin Bahari Das, of Dacca, has had to be rearrested and is now under\r\ntrial at Dacca for conspiracy of a most serious character. There is\r\nstill much lawlessness in both Bengals.[9] The continued prevalence of\r\npolitical dacoities, and especially the difficulty experienced in\r\nsecuring legal evidence against them, are distinctly unfavourable\r\nsymptoms. There are many peaceful citizens who will give private\r\ninformation as to the outrages committed by these bands, consisting\r\nmainly of youths of respectable connexions, but that so few have the\r\ncourage to face terrorism by going into the witness-box shows that the\r\nsecret societies which inspire such terror have not yet been broken up.\r\nThe extent to which disaffection is rampant in the native Bar also\r\nhampers the administration of justice, for whilst there is an eager\r\ncompetition for earning political notoriety by an eloquent defence of\r\npolitical prisoners, it is sometimes difficult to find pleaders who will\r\nundertake to conduct prosecutions. On the other hand, it is all to the\r\ngood that many of those who were ready to coquet with sedition in its\r\nearlier stages or who had not the moral courage to speak out against it\r\nseem now to be taking heart, and in this respect the reforms embodied in\r\nthe Indian Councils Act have usefully supplemented the sobering effect\r\nof repressive legislation. For one of the stock arguments of \"advanced\"\r\npoliticians has been the failure of the \"moderates\" to obtain any\r\nrecognition from Government, and the enlargement of the Legislative\r\nCouncils took the sting out of that taunt. Independently, however, of\r\nthe reforms, the extreme violence of language and of methods which had\r\ncome into vogue was bound to produce some reaction. Amongst the educated\r\nclasses, many respectable fathers of families, whatever their political\r\nopinions may be, have taken fright at the growth of turbulence and\r\ninsubordination in schools and colleges, which were often carried into\r\nthe home circle; for when once the principle of authority has been\r\nundermined the parent's authority cannot remain unshaken. In the same\r\nway some even of the \"advanced\" leaders have been alarmed by the\r\ndevelopment of secret societies which often attract young men of very\r\ngood connexions, and they have proposed to use for the detection and\r\nsuppression of dacoities the local bands of \"national volunteers\" whom\r\nthey formerly helped to organize for the purpose of enforcing the\r\nboycott and stimulating unrest. How far, even if unreservedly exercised,\r\nthe influence of such men as Mr. Surendranath Banerjee will be as potent\r\nfor checking the mischief as it was for promoting it remains to be\r\nseen. For the present also the boycott is being discountenanced in the\r\nsame quarters, though Mr. Banerjee, presumably to \"save his face,\"\r\nprofesses to have agreed only to a suspension pending the revision of\r\nPartition. But his paper, the _Bengalee_, is almost the only one that\r\npretends to regard the Partition as still an open question. It has been\r\neclipsed by far graver issues, of which the further development cannot\r\nyet be foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe return to more sober counsels seems to be confined unhappily to the\r\nolder generation, and the older generation, even if we include in it the\r\nmiddle-aged, must before long pass away. What we have to reckon with,\r\nespecially in Bengal, is the revolt of the younger generation, and this\r\nrevolt draws its inspiration from religious and philosophical sources\r\nwhich no measures merely political, either of repression or of\r\nconciliation, can reach. It often represents a perversion of the finest\r\nqualities, as, apparently, in the case of Birendranath Gupta, who\r\nmurdered Shams-ul-Alam in the Calcutta High Court last January. An\r\nEnglish missionary who knew him well assured me that in his large\r\nexperience of Indian youths he had never met one of more exemplary\r\ncharacter or higher ideals, nor one who seemed more incapable of\r\ncommitting such a crime. The oaths and vows administered on initiation\r\nto secret societies are not directed only to political ends. They impose\r\non the initiates in the most explicit terms a life of self-denial, and\r\nsometimes celibacy; and though these vows do not always avail against\r\nsome of the worst forms of sensuality, it would be foolish and wrong to\r\ngeneralize from unworthy exceptions. In its moral aspects the revolt of\r\nyoung Bengal represents very frequently a healthy reaction against sloth\r\nand self-indulgence and the premature exhaustion of manhood which is\r\nsuch a common feature in a society that has for centuries been taught to\r\ndisregard physiological laws in the enforcement of child marriage. To\r\nthis extent it is a revolt, though in the name of Hinduism, against\r\nsome of the worst results of the Hindu social system, and that it has\r\nspread so largely amongst the Brahmans of Bengal shows that it has\r\naffected even the rigidity of Brahmanism. Thus, whereas we have seen in\r\nKolhapur the Brahmans of the Deccan assert that in this \"age of\r\ndarkness\" there can be no Kshatriyas, their fellow-caste-men in Bengal\r\nare quite willing to invest Kayasthas with the sacred thread, on the\r\nground that they are really of Kshatriya descent, in order to stimulate\r\nmartial virtues amongst the Bengalees by reviving for their benefit the\r\nold Vedic caste of warriors. Equally significant is the propaganda that\r\nhas been carried on by Brahmans amongst the Namasudras, a large and\r\nmainly agricultural caste, chiefly located in the Jessor district of\r\nBengal and the Faridpur district of Eastern Bengal. The purpose of the\r\npropaganda was political, but the inducement offered to the Namasudras\r\nin order to stimulate their Nationalism was that the Brahmans would\r\nrelax the rigour of caste in favour of those who took _the Swadeshi_\r\nvow, and it is stated that, in several villages where they succeeded in\r\nmaking a large number of converts, the Brahman agitators marked their\r\napproval by condescending to have their \"twice-born\" heads shaved by the\r\nvillage barber--an act which, however trivial it may seem to us,\r\nconstituted an absolutely revolutionary breach with a 3,000 years-old\r\npast.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the constant invocation of the \"terrible goddess,\"\r\nwhether as Kali or as Durga, against the alien oppressors, shows that\r\nBrahmanism in Bengal is equally ready to appeal to the grossest and most\r\ncruel superstitions of the masses. In another of her forms she is\r\nrepresented holding in her hand her head, which has been severed from\r\nher body, whilst the blood gushing from her trunk flows into her open\r\nmouth. A very popular picture of the goddess in this form has been\r\npublished with a text to the effect that the great goddess as seen\r\ntherein symbolizes \"the Motherland\" decapitated by the English, but\r\nnevertheless preserving her vitality unimpaired by drinking her own\r\nblood. It is not surprising that amongst extremists one of the favourite\r\neuphemisms[10] applied to the killing of an Englishman is \"sacrificing a\r\nwhite goat to Kali.\" In 1906 I was visiting one of the Hindu temples at\r\nBenares and found in the courtyard a number of young students who had\r\ncome on an excursion from Bengal. I got into conversation with them, and\r\nthey soon began to air, for my benefit, their political views, which\r\nwere decidedly \"advanced.\" They were, however, quite civil and friendly,\r\nand they invited me to come up to the temple door and see them sacrifice\r\nto Kali a poor bleating kid that they had brought with them. When I\r\ndeclined, one of them who had already assumed a rather more truculent\r\ntone came forward and pressed me, saying that if I would accompany them\r\nthey would not mind even sacrificing a white goat. There was a general\r\nshout of laughter at what was evidently regarded by the others as a huge\r\njoke. I turned away, though I did not then understand its grim humour,\r\nas I do now.\r\n\r\nThe blind hatred of everything English with which the younger generation\r\nis so largely saturated can only, in most cases, be the result of the\r\nteachings that have impressed upon them the existence of a fundamental\r\nantagonism between Hindu ideals and ours. Like the wretched Kanhere at\r\nNasik, they would have to admit that they never suffered injustice\r\nthemselves nor knew of any one who had. A great many have never come\r\ninto contact with a single Englishman, and their ignorance even of the\r\nsystem of government under which they live is profound. Not the least\r\nominous symptom is that this spirit of revolt seems to have obtained a\r\nfirm hold of the zenana; and the Hindu woman behind the _purdah_ often\r\nexercises a greater influence upon her husband and her sons than the\r\nEnglishwoman who moves freely about the world. Absolute evidence in such\r\nmatters is difficult to obtain, but there was a very significant and\r\nquite authentic case last year, which I may as well quote here, though\r\nit occurred in the Bombay Presidency. Two Brahman ladies of good\r\nposition from Bombay were discovered at Kolhapur wearing the garb of\r\n_sanyasis_, i.e., mendicant ascetics. They confessed that they had left\r\ntheir homes, to which the police wisely restored them, to invoke the\r\nassistance of a great ruling chief of Southern India in a plot to\r\nexterminate the hated foreigner, and their main object in starting upon\r\nthis insane venture had been to regain their hold upon their husbands'\r\naffections by a great \"patriotic\" achievement. That real _sanyasis_ are\r\nfrequently the missionaries of sedition is certain, and their reputed\r\nsanctity gives them access to the zenana. In Bengal even small boys of\r\nso tender an age as still to have the run of zenanas have, I am told,\r\nbeen taught the whole patter of sedition, and go about from house to\r\nhouse dressed up as little _sanyasis_ in little yellow robes preaching\r\nhatred of the English.\r\n\r\nThe question is, can we extricate the better elements from this tangle\r\nof passion and prejudice? There are many foul spots in the Hindu revival\r\nin Bengal, apart even from tendencies which we cannot but regard as\r\npolitically criminal. At the same time there runs through it a strain of\r\nidealism which probably constitutes its real force, and also our danger.\r\nFor strangely emotional and often a creature of his senses, the Bengalee\r\nis accessible to spiritual influences with which the worldly-ambitious\r\nBrahmanism of the Deccan, for instance, is rarely informed. He is always\r\napt to rush to extremes, and just as amongst the best representatives of\r\nthe educated classes there was in the last century a revolt against the\r\nHindu social and religious creed of their ancestors which tended first\r\ntowards Christianity or at least the ethics of Christianity and then\r\ntowards Western agnosticism, so the present revolt may be regarded in\r\nsome of its aspects as a reaction against these earlier tendencies; and\r\nin spite of its extreme violence it may not be any more permanent. The\r\nproblem is still full of unknown quantities; but the known quantities\r\nare at any rate sufficient to make us appreciate its gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE PUNJAB AND THE ARYA SAMAJ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Punjab, the Land of the Five Rivers, differs as widely both from the\r\nDeccan and from Bengal as these two differ the one from the other. It\r\nhas been more than any other part of India the battlefield of warring\r\nraces and creeds and the seat of power of mighty dynasties. Among its\r\ncities it includes Imperial Delhi and Runjit Singh's Lahore. It is a\r\ncountry of many peoples and of many dialects. It is the home of the\r\nSikhs, but the Mahomedans, ever since the days of the Moghul Empire,\r\nform the majority of the population, and the proportion of Hindus is\r\nsmaller than in any other province of India, except Eastern Bengal.\r\nOwing to the very small rainfall, its climate is intensely dry--fiercely\r\nhot during the greater part of the year, and cold even to freezing\r\nduring the short winter months. Nowhere in India has British rule done\r\nso much to bring peace and security and to induce prosperity. The\r\nalluvial lands are rich but thirsty, and irrigation works on a scale of\r\nunparalleled magnitude were required to compel the soil to yield\r\nbeneficent harvests. At the most critical moment in the history of\r\nBritish India it was against the steadfastness of the Punjab, then under\r\nthe firm but patriarchal sway of Sir John Lawrence, that the Mutiny\r\nspent itself, and until a few years ago there seemed to be no reason\r\nwhatever for questioning the loyalty of a province which the forethought\r\nof Government and the skill of Anglo-Indian engineers were gradually\r\ntransforming into a land of plenty. Least of all did any one question\r\nthe loyalty of the Sikhs. Many of them believed that British rule was\r\nthe fulfilment of a prophecy of one of their martyred _gurus_, and the\r\nSikh regiments were regarded as the flower of the Native Army.\r\n\r\nYet it was in the Punjab, at Lahore and at Rawal Pindi, that the first\r\nserious disturbances occurred in 1907 which aroused public opinion at\r\nhome to the reality of Indian unrest, and stirred the Government of\r\nIndia to such strong repressive measures as the deportation of two\r\nprominent agitators under an ancient Ordinance of 1818 never before\r\napplied in such connexion. Local and temporary causes may to some extent\r\nhave accounted for those disturbances. An increase in the land revenue\r\ndemanded in the Rawal Pindi district was very strongly resented. The\r\nregulations issued with regard to the tenure of land in some of the new\r\nirrigation colonies were probably unwise and carried out with some\r\nharshness. Famine in the unirrigated tracts, and especially the plague,\r\nwhich had desolated parts of the province, had created much misery and\r\nbitterness. Other and more remote causes of a social and economic\r\ncharacter had also been at work. Nowhere had Anglo-Indian legislation\r\nand the introduction of elaborate forms of legal procedure produced\r\nresults more unfortunate and less foreseen by their authors than in the\r\nPunjab. The conversion of the occupants of the land into full\r\nproprietors was intended to give greater stability and security to the\r\npeasant ownership of land, but the result was to improve the position of\r\nthe moneylender, who, owing to the thriftlessness of the Indian _rayat_\r\nand the extravagant expenditure to which he is from time to time driven\r\nby traditional custom in regard to marriages, funerals, and other family\r\nceremonies, has always played a disastrously important part in village\r\nlife. As M. Chailley remarks in his admirable study of these problems,\r\n\"the agricultural debtor had now two securities to offer.\" He had\r\nalways been able to pledge his harvest, and now he could pledge also his\r\nland. On the other hand, \"a strict system of law and procedure afforded\r\nthe moneylender the means of rapidly realizing his dues,\" and the\r\npleader, who is himself a creation of that system, was ever at the elbow\r\nof both parties to encourage ruinous litigation to his own professional\r\nadvantage. Special laws were successively enacted by Government to check\r\nthese new evils, but they failed to arrest altogether a process which\r\nwas bringing about a veritable revolution in the tenure of land, and\r\nmainly to the detriment of an essentially peaceful and law-abiding class\r\nthat furnished a large and excellent contingent to the Native Army. The\r\nwretched landowner who found himself deprived of his land by legal\r\nprocess held our methods rather than his own extravagance responsible\r\nfor his ruin, and on the other hand, the pleaders and their clients, the\r\nmoneylenders, who were generally Hindus, resented equally our\r\nlegislative attempts to hamper a process so beneficial to themselves.\r\n\r\nBut all these were only contributory causes. There were still deeper\r\ninfluences at work which have operated in the Punjab in the same\r\ndirection as the forces of unrest in the Deccan and in Bengal, but\r\ndiffer from them nevertheless in their origin and in some of their\r\nmanifestations. In the Punjab too the keynote of unrest is a spirit of\r\nrevolt not merely against British administrative control, but, in theory\r\nat least, against Western influence generally, though in some respects\r\nit bears very strongly the impress of the Western influence which it\r\nrepudiates. The motive force is not conservative Brahmanism as in the\r\nDeccan, nor does it betray the impetuous emotionalism of Bengal. It is\r\nless rigid and purely reactionary than the former, and better\r\ndisciplined than the latter.\r\n\r\nOrthodox Hinduism ceased to be a dominant factor in the Punjab when the\r\nflood of Mahomedan conquest swept over the land of the Five Rivers. Even\r\nIslam did not break the power of caste, and very distinct traces of\r\ncaste still survive amongst the Mahomedan community itself. But nowhere\r\nhas caste been so much shaken as in the Punjab, for the infinity of\r\nsub-castes into which each caste has resolved itself gives the measure\r\nof its disintegration. Sikhism still represents the most successful\r\nrevolt against its tyranny in the later history of Hinduism. Hence the\r\nrelatively slight ascendency enjoyed by the Brahmans in the Punjab\r\namongst the Hindus themselves, even the Brahmans having split up into so\r\nmany sub-castes and sub-sub-castes that many a non-Brahman Hindu will\r\nhardly accept food cooked by the lower order of Brahmans--and, next to\r\ninter-marriage, food is the great test of caste. Nevertheless it is\r\namongst the Hindus of the Punjab that one of the earliest apostles of\r\nreaction against the West has found the largest and most enthusiastic\r\nbody of followers. Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of the Arya\r\nSamaj, was a Brahman of Kathiawar; he was not born in the Punjab, and it\r\nwas not in the Punjab but in Bombay, where, however, it struck no roots,\r\nthat he founded the Arya Samaj. Only in the later years of his life did\r\nthe Punjab become the chief centre of his activities. The doctrines he\r\ntaught were embodied by him in his _Satyarath Prakash_, which has become\r\nthe Bible of his disciples, and in his _Veda Bashya Basmika_, a\r\ncommentary on the Vedas. He had at an early age lost faith in the Hindu\r\nPantheon, and to this extent he was a genuine religious reformer, for he\r\nwaged relentless war against the worship of idols, and whether his\r\nclaims to Vedantic learning be or be not conceded, his creed was \"Back\r\nto the Vedas.\" His ethical code, on the other hand, was vague, and he\r\npandered strangely in some directions to the weaknesses of the flesh,\r\nand in others to popular prejudices. Nothing in the Vedas, for instance,\r\nprohibits either the killing of cattle or the eating of bovine flesh.\r\nBut, in deference to one of the most universal of Hindu superstitions,\r\nDayanand did not hesitate to include cow-killing amongst the deadliest\r\nsins. Here we have in fact the keynote of his doctrines. The sanctity of\r\nthe cow is the touchstone of Hindu hostility to both Christian and\r\nMahomedan, and the whole drift of Dayanand's teachings is far less to\r\nreform Hinduism than to rouse it into active resistance to the alien\r\ninfluences which threatened, in his opinion, to denationalize it. Hence\r\nthe outrageously aggressive tone of his writings wherever he alludes\r\neither to Christianity or to Mahomedanism. It is the advent of\r\n\"meat-eating and wine-drinking foreigners, the slaughterers of kine and\r\nother animals,\" that has brought \"trouble and suffering\" upon \"the\r\nAryas\"--he discards the word Hindu on account of its Persian\r\norigin--whilst before they came into the country India enjoyed \"golden\r\ndays,\" and her people were \"free from disease and prosperous and\r\ncontented.\" In fact, \"Arya for the Aryans\" was the cry that frequently\r\npredominated in Dayanand's teachings over that of \"Back to the Vedas,\"\r\nand Lajpat Rai, one of his most zealous disciples, has stated\r\nemphatically that \"the scheme of Swami Dayanand has its foundation on\r\nthe firm rock of _Swadeshi_ and _Swajati_.\"\r\n\r\nSince Dayanand's death the Arya Samaj has split up into two\r\nsections--the \"vegetarians\" who with regard to religious doctrine may be\r\ndescribed as the orthodox, and the \"meat-eaters,\" as the\r\nlatitudinarians. It is difficult to differentiate between the precise\r\ntendencies of these two sections, whose feuds seem to be waning. In both\r\nare to be found not a few progressive and enlightened Aryas who,\r\nwhatever their political activities may be, have undoubtedly applied\r\nthemselves with no small success to the carrying out of that part of\r\nDayanand's gospel which was directed to the reforming of Hinduism. Their\r\ninfluence has been constantly exerted to check, the marriages between\r\nmere boys and almost infant girls which have done so much physical as\r\nwell as moral mischief to Hindu society, and also to improve the\r\nwretched lot of Hindu widows whose widowhood with all that it entails of\r\nmenial degradation often begins before they have ever really been wives.\r\nTo this end the Aryas have not hesitated to encourage female education,\r\nand the Girls' Orphanage at Jalandhar, where there is also a widows'\r\nhome, has shown what excellent social results can be achieved in that\r\ndirection. Again in the treatment of the \"untouchable\" low-castes, the\r\nArya Samaj may claim to have been the first native body to break new\r\nground and to attempt something akin to the work of social reclamation\r\nof which Christianity and, in a lesser degree, Islam had hitherto had\r\nthe monopoly. Schools and especially industrial classes have been\r\nestablished in various districts which cannot fail to raise the _status_\r\nof the younger generation and gradually to emancipate the lower castes\r\nfrom the bondage in which they have been hitherto held. These and many\r\nother new departures conceived in the same liberal spirit at first\r\nprovoked the vehement hostility of the orthodox Hindus, who at one time\r\nstopped all social intercourse with the Arya reformers. But whereas in\r\nother parts of India the idea of social reform came to be associated\r\nwith that of Western ascendency and therefore weakened and gave way\r\nbefore the rising tide of reaction against that ascendency, it has been\r\nassociated in the Punjab with the cry of \"Arya for the Aryans,\" and the\r\npolitical activities of the Arya Samaj, or at least of a number of its\r\nmost prominent members who have figured conspicuously in the\r\nanti-British agitation of the last few years, have secured for it from\r\nHindu orthodoxy a measure of tolerance and even of good will which its\r\nsocial activities would certainly not otherwise have received. That the\r\nArya Samaj, which shows the impress of Western influence in so much of\r\nits social work, should at the same time have associated itself so\r\nintimately with a political movement directed against British rule is\r\none of the many anomalies presented by the problem of Indian unrest.\r\n\r\nMany Aryas, indeed, deny strenuously that the Samaj is disaffected, or\r\neven that it concerns itself with politics, and the president of the\r\nLahore branch, Mr. Roshan Lal, assured me that it devotes itself solely\r\nto moral and religious reform. I do not question that assurance, as far\r\nas Mr. Roshan Lal is himself personally concerned, and it may be true\r\nthat the Samaj has never committed itself as a body to any political\r\nprogramme, and that many individual members hold aloof from politics;\r\nbut the evidence that many others, and not the least influential, have\r\nplayed a conspicuous part in the seditious agitation of the last few\r\nyears, both in the Punjab and in the neighbouring United Provinces, is\r\noverwhelming. In the Rawal Pindi riots in 1907 the ringleaders were\r\nAryas, and in the violent propaganda which for about two years preceded\r\nthe actual outbreak of violence none figured more prominently than Lala\r\nLajpat Rai and Ajit Singh, both prominent Aryas. The immediate effect\r\nproduced by their deportation in restoring order is in itself\r\ncorroborative evidence of the share they were believed to have taken in\r\nproducing lawlessness. Ajit Singh himself is at the present moment a\r\nfugitive from justice, against whom proceedings _in absentia_ were\r\ninstituted this winter in Lahore for translating and publishing\r\nseditious books that dealt with the making of bombs, the taking of life,\r\nthe destruction of buildings, &c. In the course of these proceedings\r\nletters from Lajpat Rai were produced in Court showing that just about\r\nthe time of the disturbances he had been in communication with Shyamji\r\nKrishnavarma, of _Indian Sociologist_ fame, for a supply of books\r\n\"containing true ideas on politics\" for the students of Lahore, as well\r\nas for assistance towards defraying the cost of \"political\r\nmissionaries.\" In one of these letters also Lajpat Rai, after remarking\r\nthat \"the people are in a sullen mood\" and that \"the agricultural\r\nclasses have begun to agitate,\" adds significantly that his \"only fear\r\nis that the bursting out may not be premature.\" Lajpat Rai's\r\ncorrespondent was another prominent Arya, Bhai Parmanand, who, whilst he\r\nwas Professor at the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic College, was found in\r\npossession of various formulae for the manufacture of bombs, including\r\nthe same manual that was discovered in the Maniktola Garden at\r\nCalcutta.\r\n\r\nIn Patiala, one of the Sikh native States of the Punjab, Aryas\r\nconstituted the great majority of defendants, 76 in number, and many of\r\nthem officials and persons of position, who were put on their trial last\r\nDecember for seditious practices. So seriously were the charges felt to\r\nreflect upon the Arya Samaj as a whole that one of its leading legal\r\nmembers was briefed on its behalf for the defence. From the speech made\r\nby counsel for the prosecution in opening the case it appears that some\r\nof the defendants were schoolmasters, who were charged with preaching\r\nrevolutionary doctrines in their schools and carrying on correspondence\r\nof the same character with old pupils; others were charged with\r\ncirculating papers of the _Yugantar_ and _Swarajiya_ type; others with\r\nholding secret meetings and delivering inflammatory lectures; others\r\nagain with distributing pictures and photographs of well-known\r\nrevolutionists, including Khudiram Bose, the Muzafferpur murderer. Not\r\nonly were most of these defendants Aryas, but they were very prominent\r\nAryas, who had founded local branches of the Samaj or been members of\r\ncommittees in the State of Patiala. How far the evidence outlined by\r\ncounsel would have borne out these charges it is impossible to say,\r\nthough one may properly assume it to have been of a very formidable\r\ncharacter, for after the case had been opened against them the\r\ndefendants hastened to send in a petition invoking the clemency of the\r\nMaharajah. They expressed therein their deep sorrow for any conduct open\r\nto misconstruction, tendered their unqualified apology for any\r\nindiscreet acts they might have committed, and testified their \"great\r\nabhorrence and absolute detestation\" of anarchists and seditionists and\r\ntheir diabolical methods. His Highness thereupon ordered the prosecution\r\nto be abandoned, but at the same time banished the defendants from his\r\nState and declared their posts to be forfeited by such as had been in\r\nhis service, and only in a few cases were these punishments\r\nsubsequently remitted.\r\n\r\nThe large number of Aryas who have unquestionably taken part in the\r\npolitical agitation of the last few years certainly tends to corroborate\r\nthe very compromising certificate given only two years ago to the Samaj\r\nby Krishnavarma himself in his murder-preaching organ. He not only\r\nstated that \"of all movements in India for the political regeneration of\r\nthe country none is so potent as the Arya Samaj,\" but he added that \"the\r\nideal of that society as proclaimed by its founder is an absolutely free\r\nand independent form of national Government,\" and Krishnavarma, it must\r\nbe remembered, had been appointed by Dayanand to be a member of the\r\nfirst governing body in the lifetime of the founder and, after his\r\ndeath, one of the trustees of his will.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the question of the real tendencies of the Arya Samaj one of\r\nvery grave importance for the future is that it has embarked upon an\r\neducational experiment of a peculiar character which may have an immense\r\neffect upon the rising generation. One of its best features is the\r\nattention it has devoted to education, and to that of girls as well as\r\nof boys. But it was not till 1898 that the governing body of the Samaj\r\nin the Punjab decided to carry into execution a scheme for restoring the\r\nVedic system of education which Dayanand had conceived but had never\r\nbeen able to carry out. Under this system the child is committed at an\r\nearly age to the exclusive care of a spiritual teacher or _guru_, who\r\nstands to him _in loco parentis_ and even more, for Manu says that \"of\r\nhim who gives natural birth, and of him who gives knowledge of the\r\nVedas, the giver of sacred knowledge is the more venerable father, since\r\nsecond or divine birth ensures life to the twice-born, both in this\r\nworld and eternally.\" In the _gurukuls_ or seminaries founded by the\r\nArya Samaj pupils or _chelas_ are admitted between the ages of six and\r\nten. From that moment they, are practically cut off from the outer world\r\nduring the whole course of their studies, which cover a period of 16\r\nyears altogether--i.e., ten years in the lower school and six years in\r\nthe upper, to which they pass up as _Brahmacharis._ During the whole of\r\nthat period no student is allowed to visit his family, except in cases\r\nof grave emergency, and his parents can only see him with the permission\r\nof the head of the _gurukul_ and not more than once a month. There are\r\nat present three _gurukuls_ in the Punjab, but the most important one,\r\nwith over 250 students, is at Kangri, in the United Provinces, five\r\nmiles from the sacred city of Hardwar, where the Ganges flows out of a\r\ngorge into the great plain. A large and very popular _mela_ or fair is\r\nheld annually at Kangri, and it is attended by the _Brahmacharis,_ who\r\nact as volunteers for the maintenance of order and collect funds for the\r\nsupport of their _gurukul_. The enthusiasm is said to be very great, and\r\ndonations last year are credibly reported to have exceeded 300,000\r\nrupees.\r\n\r\nLife in the _gurukuls_ is simple and even austere, the discipline\r\nrigorous, the diet of the plainest, and a great deal of time is given to\r\nphysical training. As the _chelas_ after 16 years of this monastic\r\ntraining at the hands of their _gurus_ are to be sent out as\r\nmissionaries to propagate the Arya doctrines throughout India, the\r\ninfluence of these institutions in the moulding of Indian character and\r\nIndian opinion in the future cannot fail to be considerable. Some five\r\nyears more must elapse before we shall be able to judge the result by\r\nthe first batch of _chelas_ who will then be going forth into the world.\r\nFor the present one can only echo the hope tersely expressed a few\r\nmonths ago by Sir Louis Dane, the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, in\r\nreply to assurances of loyalty from the President of the Arya Samaj,\r\nthat \"what purports to be a society for religious and social reform and\r\nadvancement may not be twisted from its proper aims\" and \"degenerate\r\ninto a political organization with objects which are not consonant with\r\ndue loyalty to the Government as established.\" But neither the spirit of\r\nDayanand's own teachings nor the record of many of his disciples,\r\nincluding some of those actually connected with the _gurukuls_, is in\r\nthis respect encouraging.\r\n\r\nThere has been, however, no recurrence of serious disturbances in the\r\nPunjab since 1907, and if the native Press lost little of its virulence\r\nuntil the new Press Act of this year, and numerous prosecutions bore\r\nwitness to the continued prevalence of sedition, the province has been\r\nfree from the murderous outrages and dacoities which have been so\r\nlamentable a feature of the unrest in Bengal and in the Deccan. None the\r\nless there is still a very strong undercurrent of anti-British feeling.\r\nIt has partly been fostered in the large cities by Bengalee immigrants\r\nwho have come into the Punjab in considerable numbers, and thanks to\r\ntheir higher education have acquired great influence at the Bar and in\r\nthe Press, but it is rife wherever the Arya Samaj is known to be most\r\nactive, and the Arya Samaj has already proved a very powerful\r\nproselytizing agency. Its meeting houses serve not only for religious\r\nceremonies, but also as social clubs for the educated classes in all the\r\nlarger towns where they congregate. Access to them is readily given to\r\nHindus and Sikhs who have not actually joined the Samaj. They are\r\nattracted by the political discussions which are carried on there with\r\ngreat freedom, and having no such resorts of their own, they are soon\r\ntempted to obtain the fuller privileges of membership. In this way the\r\nSamaj has made many converts among the educated classes and even among\r\nnative officials. But its influence is by no means confined to them. It\r\nmakes many converts among the Sikhs, and not a few among _Nau-Muslims_\r\nor Mahomedans who have embraced Islam in relatively recent times and\r\nmainly for the purpose of escaping from the tyranny of caste. For the\r\nsame reason it attracts low-caste Hindus, for though it does not\r\nostentatiously denounce or defy caste, it has the courage to ignore it.\r\nThough the Arya leaders are generally men of education and sometimes of\r\ngreat culture, they know how to present their creed in a popular form\r\nthat appeals to the lower classes and especially to the agricultural\r\npopulation. One of the most unpleasant features has been the propaganda\r\ncarried on by them among the Sepoys of the Native Army, and especially\r\namong the Jats and the Sikhs, with whom they have many points of\r\naffinity. The efforts of the Aryas seem to be chiefly directed to\r\nchecking enlistment, but they have at times actually tampered with the\r\nloyalty of certain regiments, and their emissaries have been found\r\nwithin the lines of the native troops. Sikhism itself is at the present\r\nday undergoing a fresh process of transformation. Whilst it tends\r\ngenerally to be reabsorbed into Hinduism, the very remarkable movement\r\nfor sinking the old class distinctions--themselves a survival of\r\ncaste--and recognizing the equality of all Sikhs, is clearly due to the\r\ninfluence of the Arya Samaj. The evolution of the Arya Samaj recalls\r\nvery forcibly that of Sikhism, which originally, when founded by Nanak\r\nin the early part of the 16th century, was merely a religious and moral,\r\nreform movement, and nevertheless within 50 years developed under Har\r\nGovind into a formidable political and military organization. It is not,\r\ntherefore, surprising that some of those who know the Punjab best and\r\nthe sterner stuff of which its martial races are made look upon it as a\r\npotentially more dangerous centre of trouble than either the Deccan or\r\nBengal. One of the most mischievous results of the Aryan propaganda, and\r\none which may well cause the most immediate anxiety, is the growing\r\nantagonism which it has bred between Hindus and Mahomedans, for the\r\nMahomedans are convinced that the Arya Samaj is animated with no less\r\nbitter hostility towards Islam than towards British rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION OF THE MAHOMEDANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst I was at Delhi one of the leading Mahomedans of the old Moghul\r\ncapital drove me out one afternoon to the great Mosque which still bears\r\nwitness, in the splendour of its surviving fragments quite as much as in\r\nthe name it bears, _Kuwwat ul Islam_, or Power of Islam, to the ancient\r\nglories of Mahomedan rule in India. Two or three other Mahomedan\r\ngentlemen had come out to meet us, and there, under the shadow of the\r\nKutub Minar, the loftiest and noblest minaret from which the Musulman\r\ncall to prayer has ever gone forth, we sat in the Alai Darwazah, the\r\ngreat porch of red sandstone and white marble which formed the south\r\nentrance to the outer enclosure of the Mosque, and still presents in the\r\nstately grandeur of its proportions and the infinite variety and\r\ndelicacy of its marble lattice work, one of the most perfect monuments\r\nof early Mahomedan art, and discussed for upwards of two hours the\r\nfuture that lies before the Mahomedan community of India. It is a scene\r\nI shall never forget, so startling was the contrast between the racial\r\nand religious pride of power which those walls had for centuries\r\nreflected and the note of deep and almost gloomy apprehension to which\r\nthey now rang. For if the burden of my friends story was reasoned\r\nloyalty to the British _Raj_, it was weighted with profound anxiety as\r\nto the future that awaited the Mahomedans of India, either should our\r\n_Raj_ disappear or should it gradually lose its potency and be merged in\r\na virtual ascendency of Hinduism under the specious mantle of Indian\r\nself-government. They spoke without bitterness or resentment. They\r\nacknowledged freely the shortcomings of their own community, its\r\nintellectual backwardness, its reluctance to depart from the ancient\r\nways and to realize the necessity of equipping itself for successful\r\ncompetition under new conditions, its lack of organization, due to an\r\ninadequate sense of the duty of social service, and the selfishness and\r\njealousy often displayed by different sections and classes. They were\r\nbeginning to awaken to the dangerous consequences of their shortcomings,\r\nbut would time be given to them to repair them? The British _Raj_ had\r\nalways claimed that its mission in India was to hold the balance evenly\r\nbetween the different races and creeds and classes, and to exercise its\r\npaternal authority equally to the detriment of none and for the benefit\r\nof all. That the Hindus had from the beginning secured a considerably\r\nlarger share in Government employment of all kinds was, no doubt,\r\ninevitable, as they had shown much greater alacrity to qualify\r\nthemselves by education on Western lines than the Mahomedans,\r\nunfortunately, had until much more recently begun to show. But so long\r\nas Government _employés_ were merely the servants of Government, and\r\nHindus had no more influence than the Mahomedans in shaping the policy\r\nof the Government, the Mahomedans had no serious grievance, or, at any\r\nrate, none for which they had not themselves very largely to blame. But\r\nof late years they had seen the policy of the British Government itself\r\ngradually yielding to the pressure of Hindu agitation and the British\r\n_Raj_ actually divesting itself of some of the powers which it had\r\nhitherto retained undiminished for the benefit, in fact if not in\r\ntheory, of certain classes which, however loudly they might claim to be\r\nthe representatives of the Indian people, represented with few\r\nexceptions nothing but the political ambitions of aggressive Hinduism.\r\nThe Mahomedans, they assured me, recognized quite as fully as, and\r\nperhaps, more sincerely than, the Hindus the generous spirit which had\r\ninspired the British Government to grant the reforms embodied in the\r\nIndian Councils Act, but they also realized what it was far more\r\ndifficult for Englishmen to realize, that those reforms must inevitably\r\ntend to give the Hindus a predominant share, as compared with the\r\nMahomedans, in the counsels of Government. In its original shape the\r\nscheme of reforms had indeed threatened the Mahomedans with gross\r\nunfairness and the wrath which its subsequent modification in deference\r\nto Mahomedan representations had roused among the Hindu politicians was\r\nin itself enough to betray to all who had eyes to see and ears to hear\r\nthe purpose to which they had hoped to turn the excessive predominance\r\nthey had claimed and expected. That purpose was to advance the political\r\nascendency of Hinduism which was the goal of Hindu aspirations, whether\r\nunder the British _Raj_ or without it.\r\n\r\nThe whole tendency of the Hindu revival, social, religious, and\r\npolitical, during the last 20 years had been as consistently\r\nanti-Mahomedan as anti-British, and even more so. Some of the more\r\nliberal and moderate Hindu leaders no doubt honestly contemplated the\r\nevolution of an Indian \"nation\" in which Mahomedan and Hindu might sink\r\ntheir racial and religious differences, but these were leaders with a\r\nconstantly diminishing body of followers. Even among the Extremists not\r\na few would gladly have purchased by pious professions of good will a\r\ntemporary alliance with the Mahomedans against the British _Raj_,\r\nsubject to an ulterior settlement of accounts for their own benefit. But\r\nthe Mahomedans, with their many close points of contact with the Hindus,\r\nknew, as Englishmen could not know, what were the real sentiments and\r\nhopes of the advanced leaders into whose hands passed the control of\r\nmilitant Hinduism. They had noted the constant exhortation of the Hindu\r\nNationalist Press that the youth of India must prepare for the coming\r\nLalki incarnation of Vishnu when the _mlencchas_--i.e., the infidels,\r\nMoslem as well as British--should be driven out of India. The attitude\r\nof the Hindus towards the Mahomedans of Eastern Bengal, after the\r\nPartition, had shown how they resented the position that the creation of\r\nthe new province gave the Moslem element. Nor had the Mahomedans in the\r\nPunjab been left without a foretaste of what was to come. In every\r\nGovernment office, in every profession, the Hindus were banding\r\nthemselves closer and closer together against their few Mahomedan\r\ncolleagues. The Mahomedans had refused to join in the boycott of British\r\ngoods, and in Delhi, in Lahore, and in many other cities the word had\r\nbeen passed round among the Hindus not to deal with Mahomedan shops, not\r\nto trade with Mahomedan merchants. Some of the more violent spirits were\r\neven prepared to challenge the Mahomedans in places where the Mahomedan\r\nelement is strong and excitable, in order that the inevitable\r\nintervention of the British troops for the restoration of order should\r\nlead to the shedding of Mahomedan blood, and thus perhaps drive the\r\nMahomedans themselves in to disaffection. What educated Mahomedans, they\r\ntold me, chiefly feared, and the Hindus themselves chiefly hoped--for\r\nnew of them probably believed in any speedy overthrow of British\r\nrule--was that the British Government and the British people would be\r\nwearied by an agitation of which it was difficult for Englishmen to\r\ngrasp the real inwardness into making successive concession to the\r\nHindus which would gradually give them such a controlling voice in the\r\ngovernment of the country that they would actually be in a position to\r\nachieve their policy of ascendency under the aegis of the British _Raj_.\r\nSuch fears might seem exaggerated, but the Mahomedans could not but take\r\nnote of the extent to which the Hindu politicians had already secured\r\nthe ear of an important section of the British Press and of not a few\r\nmembers of the British Parliament, whilst in those same quarters the\r\nMahomedan case never even obtained a hearing, and when the Mahomedans at\r\nlast realized the necessity of creating an organization for the defence\r\nof their legitimate interests they were denounced for reviving racial\r\nand religious hatred. For 20 years and more the educated Mahomedans had\r\nstrictly followed the advice of their revered leader, Sir Syed Ahmed,\r\nand had put their trust in the sense of justice of the British\r\nGovernment and the fair-mindedness of the British people instead of\r\nplunging into political agitation. They had not lost their faith in the\r\nBritish Government or in the British people if their case was properly\r\nput before them, but they felt that if they were not to become the\r\nvictims of organized misrepresentation they must have an organization of\r\ntheir own which should speak for them with authority. Moreover, it was\r\nimpossible for the Mahomedans to stand any longer completely aloof from\r\npolitics, since the general trend of events in India and the enlargement\r\nof the Indian Councils had thrust new responsibilities upon the leaders\r\nof their community. Of those responsibilities none was more fully\r\nrealized than that of showing their loyalty to the British _Raj_--a\r\nloyalty all the more unalterable in that it was based upon their growing\r\nconviction that the maintenance of the British _Raj_ was essential to\r\nthe welfare, and even to the existence, of the Mahomedans of India.\r\n\r\nAs I write I have before me a letter from another Mahomedan friend, a\r\nman both of European education and very wide knowledge of his Indian\r\nco-religionists, with whom he enjoys exceptional credit. I was so much\r\nimpressed with the prevalence of this form of fatalism that I wrote and\r\nasked him for his opinion. This is his answer:--\r\n\r\n   Moslems feel that while at present the Government in India\r\n   is British in spirit as well as in name, there are already indications\r\n   that it might gradually become Hindu in fact, though\r\n   the British form might remain. The whole object of the\r\n   advanced Congress Party and of the leaders of the Nationalist\r\n   movement is not the overthrow of British rule in name, but in\r\n   fact. You may say that this is a wild apprehension, and that\r\n   the Government is not foolish enough or weak enough to\r\n   degenerate into a mere form. That may be the attitude\r\n   of an Englishman who is in India only as a bird of passage\r\n   (and all Englishmen are there as birds of passage, for only those\r\n   whose children belong to the country are permanently bound\r\n   up with it). For us who live here, and whose children are to\r\n   live here, the distant as well as the immediate future is of\r\n   essential importance. Now what is the tendency of Government?\r\n   Can any one deny that, taken as a whole, it is towards\r\n   Hindu predominance in the long run? English observers\r\n   must not forget that there is throughout India amongst Hindus\r\n   a strong tendency towards imitating the National movements\r\n   that have proved successful in European history. Now,\r\n   while _vis-à-vis_ the British the Hindu irreconcilables assume\r\n   the attitude of the Italian patriots towards the hated Austrian,\r\n   _vis-à-vis_ the Moslems there is a very different European\r\n   model for them to follow. Not only Tilak and his school in\r\n   Poona, but throughout the Punjab and Bengal the constant\r\n   talk of the Nationalists is that the Moslems must be driven\r\n   out of India as they were driven out of Spain.\r\n\r\n   This is no invention of ours. Nor is it quite so wild as it\r\n   appears at first sight. I have gone into the matter carefully\r\n   and I can certainly conceive circumstances--50 or 100 years\r\n   hence--that would make India intolerable for our upper middle\r\n   classes; and once you get rid of the intelligent and wealthy\r\n   Moslems the masses could be reduced to absolute subjection\r\n   in the hands of Hindu rulers. Far be it from me to say that\r\n   all Hindus are of this purpose or that the school of \"liberal\r\n   Nationalism\" to which Gokhale belongs has ceased to exist.\r\n   But the other school predominates, and as our very existence\r\n   is at stake we Moslems do not want to take any risks or to see\r\n   even the very first steps taken towards transforming the\r\n   British into a Hindu _raj_. Yet those steps are now being taken,\r\n   though not quite so fast as we at one time feared and Hindus\r\n   expected. That the sad and terrible fate which our people\r\n   had in Spain may still be ours in India is a proposition that\r\n   sounds extravagant at first, but I for my part (and most\r\n   thoughtful Moslems agree with me) consider it quite possible,\r\n   and in a matter of such moment we must take possibilities\r\n   as well at probabilities into consideration.\r\n\r\n   The Imperial problem in India is not to get this or that law\r\n   changed, or so and so many troops increased, or such and such\r\n   measures of repression or concession adopted. It is to bring\r\n   about a new mental and spiritual attitude, and to replace\r\n   the narrow \"Nationalism\" of the present day by a broad\r\n   and truly liberal Imperialism in the practical sense of securing\r\n   general recognition for India's difficulties and divisions, and for\r\n   the natural and necessary maintenance of the British connexion\r\n   and of British rule. The statesman who can suggest\r\n   practical means for carrying out this intellectual conversion\r\n   will certainly have saved England and India much unhappiness\r\n   and disaster.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am bound to say that there are also many Mahomedans\r\nwho, though professing similar apprehensions, show no disposition\r\ntowards fatalistic resignation. For they believe that, whatever may be\r\nthe fate of the British _raj_, the future must belong to the more virile\r\npeoples of India, and certainly those who do not merely put their trust\r\nin the fighting traditions of a conquering race may find a good deal of\r\nencouragement for the faith within them from the vital statistics of\r\nHindus and Mahomedans respectively in India.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is most important that nothing should be done to give colour\r\nto the idea sedulously promoted by the Hindu politician that Government\r\nintend to favour, or, as he generally puts it, to \"pamper,\" the\r\nMahomedans at the expense of the Hindus, it is equally important that\r\nGovernment should do nothing to strengthen the apprehensions entertained\r\nby so many intelligent and educated Mahomedans. Those apprehensions are\r\nno doubt exaggerated, and may even be quite unfounded; but they\r\ncorrespond exactly with what I have been told were Tilak's hopes and\r\nanticipations, and if we will only take the trouble to try to see things\r\nas they may well strike an Indian Mahomedan we can hardly dismiss them\r\nas wholly unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism between the two communities is not the creation or the\r\nresult of British rule. It is the legacy of centuries of conflict before\r\nBritish rule was ever heard of in India. It has been and must be one of\r\nthe chief objects of British statesmanship to compose this conflict, and\r\nthe Mahomedans do not deny that their British rulers have always\r\ndesired to deal as fairly with them as with the Hindus. They hold,\r\nhowever, that, as a matter of fact, British rule has in many ways worked\r\nout to the relative detriment of Mahomedan influence and to the greater\r\nadvantage of the Hindus. Nor is that fact rendered any more palatable to\r\nthe Mahomedans because it is mainly due to the greater adaptability and\r\nsuppleness displayed by the Hindus ever since India has been brought\r\ninto contact with Western education and Western methods. The\r\nestablishment of English as the official language of the Law Courts and\r\nof all public Departments necessarily favoured the Hindus by displacing\r\nPersian and the vernaculars in which the Mahomedans were most\r\nproficient. At the present day the vast majority of Indians employed in\r\nevery branch of the Government service are Hindus, and this majority is\r\nentirely out of proportion to the numerical preponderancy of the Hindu\r\ncommunity at large[11]. According to the last Census Report the Hindus\r\nof Bengal (which was then unpartitioned), though only twice as numerous\r\nas the Mahomedans, held 1,235 higher appointments under Government in\r\nBengal, as against only 141 held by Mahomedans. In the Bombay Presidency\r\nthe Hindus held 266 such appointments, as against 23 held by Mahomedans;\r\nand in the Central Provinces 339, as against 75. Of the provinces in\r\nreference to which the report furnishes detailed statistics the United\r\nProvinces alone failed to show the same disparity, the number of posts\r\nheld by the Mahomedans, 453, against 711 held by Hindus, being actually\r\nand very largely in excess of their proportion to population. The\r\nMahomedans, moreover, complain that where Mahomedans are employed as\r\nclerks in Government Departments the head clerks, who are almost always\r\nHindus and alone have direct access to the English superior officers,\r\nuse their influence with the latter to prejudice them against their\r\nMahomedan subordinates. Education has passed very largely from our own\r\nhands into those of Hindu teachers. In all the liberal professions, at\r\nthe Bar, in the Press, the preponderance of Hindus is greatly out of\r\nproportion even to the numerical preponderance of the Hindu population\r\nas a whole. Intelligent Mahomedans are conscious that all this is to a\r\ngreat extent the result of the backwardness of their community, but\r\nhardships are none the less hardships because they are largely of one's\r\nown making. Again, the principal seat of the Government of India and\r\nthose of the two great Presidency Governments are in centres of Hindu\r\nlife where the voice of the Mahomedan element does not make itself\r\neasily heard.\r\n\r\nThen Mahomedans who watch public opinion in England note that one of the\r\ntwo great parties in the State has for many years past professed to\r\nrecognize in the views of Hindu politicians a commendable affinity to\r\nits own political principles, whilst the memory of its greatest leader,\r\nMr. Gladstone, is chiefly associated in India with a violent hostility\r\nto Turkey, which, at any rate amongst many of his followers, degenerated\r\ninto violent denunciations of Islam in general. By his personal\r\nqualities Lord Ripon, the most pronounced Liberal ever sent out in our\r\ntime as Viceroy, endeared himself to many Mahomedans as well as to the\r\nHindus, but he never made any secret of his political sympathies with\r\nHindu aspirations. Whilst Unionist Governments were in office, with only\r\none short break during a period of nearly 20 years, and especially\r\nwhilst Lord Curzon was Viceroy, the alliance between the Hindu leaders\r\nand Radical politicians at home became more and more intimate. The Hindu\r\nNational Congress, which the Mahomedans had come to regard as little\r\nmore than a Hindu political organization, was not only generally\r\nacclaimed by English newspapers of an advanced complexion as the\r\nexponent of a new-born Indian democracy, but it had founded[12] in\r\nLondon an organ of its own, _India_, subsidized out of its funds, and\r\nedited and managed by Englishmen, which may not have a very large\r\ncirculation at home, but is the chief purveyor of Indian news to a large\r\npart of the Liberal Press. When Radical members of Parliament visited\r\nIndia the views they chiefly cared to make themselves acquainted with or\r\nreproduced when they went home were the views of Hindu politicians, and\r\nwhen the latter visited England they could always depend upon the\r\ndemonstrative hospitality not only of Radical clubs and associations but\r\nalso of the Radical Press for their political propaganda.\r\n\r\nWhen the Liberal Party returned to power at the end of 1905 the majority\r\nin the new House of Commons included a very active group that identified\r\nitself wholeheartedly with a campaign which, in Bengal, soon assumed a\r\ncharacter of scarcely less hostility to the Mahomedans than to the\r\nBritish Administration, and the new Government announced their intention\r\nof preparing a scheme of reforms which, whatever its merits, was greeted\r\nin India as a concession to Hindu rather than to Mahomedan sentiment.\r\nFor the Mahomedan has always been a believer in personal rule, and one\r\nof the objects of the reforms scheme was to diminish to some extent that\r\nelement in the Indian Administration. Moreover, when it was first\r\noutlined by the Secretary of State, the scheme contained provisions\r\nwhich seemed to the Mahomedans to be at variance both with principles of\r\nfair and equal treatment for all races and creeds and classes upon which\r\nBritish rule had hitherto been based, and with the specific pledges\r\ngiven by the Viceroy to the Mahomedan deputation that waited upon him\r\nfour years ago at Simla when the reforms were first contemplated. The\r\nnew representation in the enlarged Indian Councils was based\r\nproportionally upon a rough estimate of the populations of India which\r\ncredited the Hindus with millions that are either altogether outside the\r\npale of Hinduism or belong to those castes which the majority of\r\neducated Hindus of the higher castes still regard as \"untouchable.\" The\r\neffect would have been to give the Hindus what the Mahomedans regarded\r\nas an unfairly excessive representation. Happily, though, the question\r\ntrembled for a long time in the balance, Lord Morley listened to the\r\nremonstrances of the Mahomedans, and in its final shape the Indian\r\nCouncils Act made very adequate provision for the representation of\r\nMahomedan interests. But the Mahomedans saw in the angry disappointment\r\nof the Hindu politicians when the scheme was thus modified ample\r\njustification for the fears they had entertained. Even as it is--and the\r\nMahomedans recognize both the many good points of the scheme and Lord\r\nMorley's desire to deal fairly with them--these new reforms may well\r\nseem to the Mahomedans to have enured mainly to the benefit of the\r\nHindus. The Mahomedans appreciate as warmly as the Hindus the\r\nappointment of an Indian member to the Viceroy's Executive Council, and\r\nif the first Indian member was to be a Hindu they admit that Mr. Sinha\r\nhad exceptional qualifications for the high post to which he was called.\r\nThe Indian members added under the now Act to the Executive Councils of\r\nBombay and Madras are also both Hindus, and another Hindu will almost\r\ncertainly be nominated in like manner to the Executive Council of\r\nBengal. None of these appointments may be open to objection, but the\r\nfact nevertheless remains that it is the Hindus and not the Mahomedans\r\nwho will have had the immediate benefit of this new departure to which\r\nIndian opinion attaches the greatest importance.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the more we delegate of our authority in India to the\r\nnatives of India on the principles which we associate with\r\nself-government, the more we must necessarily in practice delegate it to\r\nthe Hindus, who form the majority, however much we may try to protect\r\nthe rights and interests of the Mahomedan minority. This is what the\r\nMahomedans know and fear. This is what explains their insistence upon\r\nseparate electorates wherever the elective principle comes into play in\r\nthe composition of representative bodies. It is not merely that they\r\nhave yet to learn the elementary business of electoral organization, in\r\nwhich the Hindus, on the contrary, have shown great proficiency, and\r\nthat they have consequently fared badly even in local bodies where their\r\nnumbers ought to have secured them more adequate representation. Many\r\nMahomedans realize the disadvantage of locking up their community in a\r\nwatertight compartment, but they regard it as the lesser evil. It is,\r\nthey contend, an essential safeguard not only against an excessive Hindu\r\npredominance in elective or partly elective bodies, but also against the\r\ngrowing disposition which they note amongst those who claim to be the\r\nspokesmen of the rising British democracy to accelerate the rate at\r\nwhich political concessions should be made to Hindu opinion, and also to\r\ndisregard the claim of the Mahomedan minority to be protected against\r\nany abuse by the Hindus of the power which a majority must necessarily\r\nwield.\r\n\r\nMy object is to explain the views actually held by the leaders of the\r\nIndian Mahomedan community, rather than to endorse or to controvert\r\nthem. Even if the construction they place upon the attitude of their\r\nHindu fellow-countrymen and of an influential section of British public\r\nopinion be wholly unreasonable, the fact that that attitude is liable to\r\nsuch a construction is one which we ought to bear in mind. Nor can it be\r\ndisputed that, however generous the sentiments that prompt us to\r\ndelegate some part of our authority to elective or partly elective\r\nassemblies, it must to some extent diminish the power of the Executive\r\nto ensure that equality of treatment for all races and creeds and\r\nclasses by which we have hitherto justified our rule in India. Our sense\r\nof equity should make us, therefore, all the more scrupulously careful\r\nto adjust the balance as evenly as possible under the new conditions\r\nwhich we are ourselves creating, and to err, if at all, in favour of the\r\nprotection of minorities. Elementary considerations of statesmanship\r\nimpose the same obligation upon us.\r\n\r\nThe Mahomedans of India form more than a fifth of the whole population.\r\nThey are not racially any more homogeneous than the Hindus, and except\r\ntowards the north-western frontier, where they are to be found chiefly\r\namongst the half-tamed tribes of the Indian borderland, and in the\r\nPunjab and United Provinces, where there are many descendants of the\r\nMoslem conquerors, they consist chiefly of converted Hindus who accepted\r\nIslam as a consequence of Mahomedan rule. But whatever racial\r\ndifferences there may be amongst them, they are now bound together by a\r\ncreed which has an extraordinary welding power. That there are also\r\nexplosive potentialities in their creed the Wahabi rising in Bengal\r\nlittle more than 30 years ago and the chronic turbulence of the tribes\r\nand frequent exploits of _ghazis_ on the north-western frontier are\r\nthere to show. But amongst the large body of Mahomedans scattered\r\nthrough India, and especially amongst the higher classes, Islam has in a\r\ngreat measure lost its aggressive character. Surrounded on all sides by\r\nan overwhelming majority of Hindus, whose religion he regards as\r\ndetestably idolatrous, the Indian Moslem is inclined to sink his\r\nhostility to Christianity and to regard us less as \"infidels\" than as\r\nfellow-believers in the central article of his monotheistic faith, the\r\nunity of God. We, too, in his eyes are a \"People of the Book,\" though\r\nour Book is not the Koran, but the Bible, of which he does not\r\naltogether deny the sacred character. Other things also often draw him\r\ntowards the Englishman. The Englishman to him represents a ruling race,\r\nand to such an one he feels that he who also represents a once ruling\r\nrace can yield a more willing allegiance than to any one of a race which\r\nhe himself ruled over. Equally his fighting and his sporting instincts\r\nalso appeal to many Englishmen. Hence both Englishmen and Mahomedans in\r\nIndia frequently feel that they have more in common than either of them\r\nhas with the Hindu. The Mahomedans, moreover, consisting very largely of\r\nthe most virile races in India, have always furnished some of the best\r\ncontingents of the British Indian Army. Their loyalty has never wavered\r\nexcept during the Mutiny, and modern Indian writers of the Nationalist\r\nschool are themselves at pains to show that, though the mutineers\r\nrallied round the feeble descendant of the Moghul Emperors as the only\r\navailable figurehead, and many Mahomedans proved themselves good\r\n\"patriots,\" it was Hindus like Nana Sahib and Tantia Tope and the Ranee\r\nof Jhansi who were the real heroes and moving spirits of that \"War of\r\nIndian Independence.\"\r\n\r\nIn our day the British connexion has had no stouter and more convinced\r\nsupporter than the late Sir Syed Ahmad, than whom no Mahomedan has\r\ndeserved or enjoyed greater influence over his Indian co-religionists.\r\nNot only does his educational work, based on the English public school\r\nsystem, live after him in the college which he founded at Aligarh, but\r\nalso his political faith which taught the vast majority of educated\r\nMahomedans to regard their future as bound up with the preservation of\r\nBritish rule. The revival of Hinduism has only served to strengthen that\r\nfaith by bringing home to the Mahomedans the value of British rule as a\r\nbulwark against the Hindu ascendency which in the more or less remote\r\nfuture they have unquestionably begun to dread. The creation of a\r\npolitical organization like the All-India Moslem League, which is an\r\noutcome of the new apprehensions evoked by Hindu aspirations, may appear\r\non the surface to be a departure from the teachings of Sir Syed Ahmad,\r\nwho, when the Indian National Congress was appealing in its early days\r\nfor Mahomedan support, urged his people to hold altogether aloof from\r\npolitics and to rely implicitly upon the good will and good faith of\r\nGovernment. But things have moved rapidly since Sir Syed Ahmad's time,\r\nand when the British Government themselves create fresh opportunities\r\nfor every Indian community to make its voice heard in political counsel,\r\nthe Mahomedans hold that none can afford to stand back.\r\n\r\nThe Moslem League founded by the Aga Khan, one of the most broad-minded\r\nand highly-educated of Indians, with the full approval of the late Nawab\r\nMohsin-ul-Mulk, the confidant and successor of Sir Syed Ahmad, is\r\nmoreover not merely or even chiefly a political organization. It is\r\nintended to serve as a centre for the maintenance and consolidation of\r\nthe communal interests of the Mahomedans all over India in their social,\r\neducational, and economic as well as political aspects. Its programme\r\nwas unfolded at the annual meeting of the League held in January last at\r\nDelhi both in an address read on behalf of Mr. Ameer Ali, who was\r\ndetained in England by his duties on the Judicial Committee of the Privy\r\nCouncil, and in a speech delivered by the Aga Khan, the recognized\r\nleader of the whole community. The programme of the Moslem League puts\r\nforward no such ambitious demands as self-government for India. All it\r\nasks for is \"the ordered development of the country under the Imperial\r\nCrown.\" It accepts the reforms with much more gratitude and enthusiasm\r\nthan were displayed by the spokesman of the Indian National Congress at\r\nLahore, and it accepts them in no narrow or sectarian spirit. The Aga\r\nKhan was in fact at special pains to indicate the various directions in\r\nwhich Mahomedans and Hindus might and ought to act in harmonious\r\nco-operation. The functions of the Mahomedan representatives on the new\r\nCouncils would, the Aga Khan said, be threefold.\r\n\r\n   In the first place they must co-operate as representative\r\n   Indian citizens with other Indians in advancing the well-being\r\n   of the country by working wholeheartedly for the\r\n   spread of education, for the establishment of free and universal\r\n   primary education, for the promotion of commerce and\r\n   industry, for the improvement of agriculture by the establishment\r\n   of co-operative credit and distribution societies, and\r\n   for the development of the natural resources of India. Here,\r\n   indeed, is a wide field of work for Hindus and Mahomedans\r\n   acting together. In the second place our representatives\r\n   must be ready to co-operate with the Hindus and all other\r\n   sections of society in securing for them all those advantages\r\n   that serve their peculiar conditions and help their social\r\n   welfare, for although the two sister communities have developed\r\n   on different lines, each suffers from some peculiar\r\n   weakness in addition to the misfortunes common to\r\n   general economic and educational backwardness. And then\r\n   our representatives must watch and promote social measures\r\n   required exclusively for the benefit of their Moslem co-religionists,\r\n   with the co-operation, we hope, of the Hindu\r\n   members, for we too have needs that are not known to them\r\n   and which we alone can fully understand.\r\n\r\nNo language could be more generous or more statesmanlike. The Aga Khan\r\ndoubtless realizes that, whatever the more or less remote future may\r\nhave in store for the two communities, their increasing antagonism in\r\nconsequence of the aggressive tendencies, displayed by Hindu\r\n\"nationalism\" during the last few years is pregnant with immediate\r\ndanger, and nowhere more so than in the Punjab where he was speaking.\r\nNot only have the preachers of the Arya Samaj, taking their cue from the\r\nwritings of their apostle Dayanand, frequently indulged, both in the\r\nPress and on the platform, in outrageous attacks upon the Mahomedans'\r\nreligion, but the militant Hindus have visited upon the Mahomedans their\r\nrefusal to join in an anti-British agitation by enforcing against them a\r\ncommercial and social boycott, none the less oppressive and damaging\r\nbecause it is not openly proclaimed. The bitterness thus engendered\r\nfound vent in serious riots this year at Peshawar, just as it did in\r\nEastern Bengal, when the boycott campaign there was at its height. Even\r\nin Hyderabad, the capital of the Nizam's dominions, where, under the\r\nwise administration of a great Mahomedan ruler whose Prime Minister is a\r\nHindu, the relations between Moslem and Hindu have hitherto been quite\r\nharmonious, a change is gradually making itself felt under the\r\ninspiration of a small group of Bengali Hindus who have brought with\r\nthem the Nationalist cry of \"Arya for the Aryan.\" The animosity which\r\nhas always existed between the Mahomedans and the Hindus, especially\r\namongst the lower orders, has been a constant source of anxiety to\r\nAnglo-Indian administrators. As far as it springs from the clash of\r\nreligious beliefs, social customs, and historical traditions, it can\r\nonly be eradicated by the slow process of education. The most trivial\r\nincident, the meeting of rival processions, the maltreatment of a cow,\r\nso sacred to the Hindus, some purely personal quarrel suddenly leads to\r\nviolent affrays in which the whole populace on both sides joins in\r\nwithout knowing even what it is all about. The danger must be enormously\r\nheightened if one community begins to believe that the other community\r\nis compassing deep-laid schemes for the promotion of its own ultimate\r\nascendancy. The political agitation conducted by the Hindus has for some\r\ntime past tended to create such a belief amongst the Mahomedans. As far\r\nback as 1893, at the time of the Bombay riots and of Tilak's\r\n\"anti-cow-killing\" propaganda in the Deccan, which spread sporadically\r\nto other parts of India, the Bombay Government reported \"an uneasy\r\nfeeling among Mahomedans that they and their faith were suffering at the\r\nhands of the Hindus, that they were being gradually but surely edged out\r\nof the position they have hitherto held, and that their religion needed\r\nsome special protection.\" That uneasy feeling has gradually ripened\r\nsince then into a widespread and deep-rooted conviction--not the least\r\nof the many deplorable results of a movement that claims to be called\r\n\"national.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be an evil day for the internal peace of India if a people\r\nstill so proud of their history, so jealous of their religion, and so\r\nconscious of their virile superiority as the Mahomedans came to believe\r\nthat they could only trust to their own right hand, and no longer to the\r\nauthority and sense of justice of the British _Raj_, to avert the\r\ndangers which they foresee in the future from the establishment of an\r\novert or covert Hindu ascendancy. Some may say that it would be an\r\nequally evil day for the British _Raj_ if the Mahomedans came to believe\r\nin the futility of unrequited loyalty and joined hands with its enemies\r\nin the confident anticipation that, whatever welter might follow the\r\ncollapse of British rule, they could not fail sooner or later to fight\r\ntheir way once more to the front. Certainly at no time since we have\r\nruled India has greater circumspection been needed in holding the\r\nbalance between the two communities. It would be as impolitic to forget\r\nthat the Mahomedans have held steadfastly aloof from the anti-British\r\nmovement of the last few years and represent on the whole a great\r\nconservative force, as to create the impression amongst the Hindus at\r\nlarge, of whom the vast majority are still our friends, that we are\r\ndisposed to visit upon them the disloyalty of what is after all a small\r\nsection of their community by unduly favouring the Mahomedans at their\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnrest in its most dangerous forms has hitherto been almost entirely\r\nconfined to the Deccan, Bengal, and the Punjab. It has spread to some\r\nextent from the Bombay Presidency into the Central Provinces, which,\r\nindeed, include part of the Deccan, and it has overflowed both from\r\nBengal and from the Punjab into some of the neighbouring districts of\r\nthe United Provinces. But thanks very largely to the firm and\r\nexperienced hands in which the administration of the Central Provinces\r\nunder their Commissioner, Mr. Craddock, and that of the United Provinces\r\nunder their Lieutenant-Governor, Sir John Hewett, have rested during\r\nthese troublous years, the situation there has never got seriously out\r\nof hand. Except in Peshawar, where the political propaganda of a\r\nsomewhat militant colony of Bengalees has stimulated the latent\r\nantagonism between Hindus and Mahomedans, our difficulties in the new\r\nFrontier Province, as well as along the whole North-West frontier, are\r\nof quite a different order, and though the turbulence of Pathan tribes\r\nand the occasional outbreaks of Moslem fanaticism amongst them are a\r\ncause of constantly recurring anxiety to the Government of India, it is\r\nnot amongst those hardy and only half-tamed hillsmen that the cry of\r\n_Swadeshi_ and _Swaraj_ from Bengal or of \"Arya for the Aryans\" from the\r\nPunjab is likely to elicit any response. Such echoes of far away\r\nsedition as may reach their mountain fastnesses provoke only vague\r\nwonder at the forbearance and leniency of British rulers, and if ever\r\nthe British _Raj_ were in jeopardy, Pathan and Baluch would be the first\r\nto sharpen their swords and shoulder their rifles either in response to\r\nour call or in order to descend on their own account, as their forbears\r\nhave done before, into the fair plains of Hindustan and carve out\r\nkingdoms for themselves from the chaos that would follow the collapse of\r\nBritish power. Along the North-East frontier British India marches with\r\nsemi-independent States that have little or nothing in common with the\r\nrest of India. Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim are Himalayan highlands\r\ninhabited chiefly by Mongolian Buddhists, who have far more affinity\r\nwith Tibetans and Chinese than with their Indian neighbours to the\r\nsouth. Assam is little more than an administrative dependency of Eastern\r\nBengal, whilst Burma has been even more accurately described as a mere\r\nappendage of India, attached for purposes of administrative convenience\r\nto our Indian Empire, but otherwise as effectively divided from it by\r\nrace, religion, customs, and tradition as by the waters of the Bay of\r\nBengal and the dense jungles of the Patkai Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn none of these borderlands has Hinduism ever struck root, and in none\r\nof them, therefore, is Indian Nationalism, which is so largely bound up\r\nwith Hinduism, likely to find a congenial soil. But that Southern India\r\nwhere Hinduism is supreme should have remained hitherto so little\r\naffected by the political agitation which has swept across India further\r\nnorth from the Deccan to Bengal may at first sight cause some surprise.\r\nYet the explanation is not far to seek, if one bears in mind the\r\nprofound differences which nature itself has imposed upon this vast\r\nsub-continent. Southern India, which may be defined as including the\r\nwhole of the Madras Presidency and the three native States of Mysore,\r\nCochin, and Travancore, differs, indeed, almost immeasurably from\r\nCentral and Northern India. South of the high, sun-scorched plateau of\r\nthe Deccan, from the mouth of the Kistna to the Indian Ocean, the great\r\nIndian peninsula rapidly narrows. Tempered by more frequent rains and\r\nthe moist breezes which sweep across it from both the Malabar and the\r\nCoromandel coasts, the climate is more equable and the heat, though more\r\ncontinuous, is less fierce. The whole character of the country is\r\nluxuriantly tropical, and though the lowlands are not more fertile than\r\nthe matchless delta of the Ganges, the more varied prodigality of nature\r\nshows itself alike in the waving forests of cocoanut, which are common\r\nall along the coast, in the rich tobacco-fields of Madura and\r\nCoimbatore, in the plantations of cinchona, pepper, cardamoms, and other\r\nspices on the slopes of the Nilgiri highlands, and in the splendid\r\ngrowths of teak, ebony, and sandalwood that clothe the Western Ghats.\r\nThe population, which in some parts attains extraordinary density and\r\nlives almost exclusively on the fruits of the soil, is of the old\r\nDravidian stock, industrious and frugal as in other parts of India, and\r\nof a placid and gentle temper. Nowhere else in India does one come into\r\nsuch close contact with its original non-Aryan peoples; and nowhere else\r\nhas the earliest type of religious and social institutions evolved by\r\nthe superior civilization of the Aryans been so completely preserved\r\nfrom the disturbing influences of later ages. And yet--such are the\r\ncurious contrasts which abound in this strange country--nowhere else\r\ndoes one find so many living survivals of the intercourse which occurred\r\nfrom time to time between India and the West, many centuries before\r\nEurope turned her eyes towards that Terra Incognita. Nowhere, for\r\ninstance, has Christianity made more converts of recent years, perhaps\r\nbecause in Southern India there may still be found indigenous Christian\r\ncommunities which trace their origin back to the first centuries of the\r\nChristian era. Even if there be no historical foundation for the\r\ntradition that it was St. Thomas the Apostle who himself first\r\nevangelized Southern India, and was ultimately martyred at St. Thomas's\r\nMount near Madras, there is good authority for believing that\r\nChristianity was imported not many centuries later into Southern India\r\nby the Nestorian or Chaldæan missionaries from Persia and Mesopotamia,\r\nwhose apostolic zeal ranged all over Asia, even into Tibet and Tartary.\r\nAccording to the Saxon chronicle, our own King Alfred sent alms to India\r\nin 883 for St. Thomas and St. Bartholomew, and at that date there\r\ncertainly existed, besides some small Christian communities on the\r\nCoromandel coast, two flourishing communities on the Malabar coast,\r\nwhere the so-called Syrian Church has maintained itself to the present\r\nday. Another curious and perhaps equally ancient link with the West may\r\nstill be seen to survive to-day in the small community of white Jews at\r\nCochin, which, according to their own tradition, was founded when their\r\nforefathers were driven out of Palestine after the destruction of the\r\nsecond Temple. To the charter which they still have in their possession,\r\ninscribed, like most west coast title deeds, on copper plates, the date\r\nassigned by the best authorities is about 700 A.D., and the powers and\r\nprivileges which were specifically conferred upon their ancestors show\r\nthat at that period already they had acquired in a remarkable degree the\r\nconfidence and friendship of the Hindu Kings of Malabar. The decline of\r\nboth Christian and Jewish communities seems to have begun, indeed, with\r\nthe appearance of the first Portuguese invaders from Europe, whose\r\nincursions destroyed the peace and tolerance which Christian and Jew had\r\nenjoyed in the days of undisturbed Hindu rule.\r\n\r\nTo what period the subjection of the old Dravidian stock to the superior\r\ncivilization of the Aryans dates back, or in what manner it was\r\ncontinued, there is little as yet to show. All that is actually known is\r\nthat at some very remote period Aryan Hinduism was imported into\r\nSouthern India by Brahmans from the north, who established it in the\r\nfirst place probably by force, and whose descendants have ever since\r\nmaintained the claims of their sacred caste to a position of religious\r\nand social pre-eminence even greater than that which any other Brahmans\r\nof the present day have succeeded in retaining. Nowhere else in India\r\ndoes the Brahman, as such, wield the power and assert the prerogatives\r\nwhich the Namputri Brahman enjoys on the Malabar coast. Even the\r\nMaharajahs of Travancore, who by birth belong to the Kshatrya or warrior\r\ncaste, have to be \"born again\" by a peculiar and costly ceremony into\r\nthe superior caste before they ascend the throne, and one sept of the\r\nNamputri Brahmans successfully exacts in the person of the head of the\r\nAzhvancheri family recognition of its spiritual overlordship by personal\r\nhomage from the Maharajah once in every six years. Nothing, perhaps,\r\nconveys more graphically the extraordinary sanctity which attaches to\r\nthe Brahman caste than the uncompromising manner in which all along the\r\nMalabar coast they have enforced and maintained the laws of ceremonial\r\n\"pollution.\" Nowhere else have such stringent rules been enacted to fix\r\nthe precise distance at which the bodily presence of a member of the\r\nlower castes is held to defile the sacred person of the Brahman. A Bazar\r\nmay approach, but must not touch him; a Chogan may not approach him\r\nwithin 24 feet, nor a Kanisan within 36, nor a Pulayan within 64, nor a\r\nNayadi within 72 feet. Equally definite and elaborate are the manifold\r\nrestrictions on marriage, commensality, occupation, food, ceremonial\r\nobservances and personal conduct which affect the mutual relations not\r\nonly between the different castes but also between the innumerable\r\nsub-castes into which the higher castes especially have in turns split\r\nup. The laws which govern marriage, descent, and inheritance amongst the\r\nmore important castes throw a peculiarly interesting light on the\r\narchaic type of society which has survived in Southern India. Under the\r\nmatriarchal system of _Manumakkathayam_, which on the Malabar coast\r\nobtains to the present day, descent is traced only through the female\r\nline. The male member of the family inherits, but he does so only as\r\nthe son of a female member of the family through whom he may justly\r\nclaim kinship, or, to put it in another form, a man's natural heir is\r\nnot his son, or his brother's son, or the descendant of a common male\r\nancestor, but his sister's, or his sister's daughter's son, or the\r\ndescendant of a common female ancestress. In the event of failure of\r\nheirs through the female line, adoption is permissible, but the adoption\r\nmust be of females, through whose subsequent offspring the line of\r\nnatural descent may be carried on. With this ancient system are bound up\r\nforms of matrimonial union and tenure of property into the complicated\r\nand peculiar nature of which I need not enter here.\r\n\r\nIn the wild hill countries weird remnants of the most primitive races\r\nstill survive that have not yet been brought within the pale of\r\nHinduism, and here and there a sprinkling of Mahomedans remains as a\r\nreminder of the shortlived incursions of Moslem conquerors from the\r\nnorth. But ninety per cent. of the population consists of Hindus, and\r\nthe social and religious supremacy of Hinduism has never been seriously\r\nassailed. Nowhere has Hindu architecture taken such majestic shape, the\r\nmassive pylons of Madura and Tanjore recalling the imperishable grandeur\r\nof the noblest Egyptian temples on the Nile. Southern India is in fact a\r\nland of stately shrines which dominate the whole country just as our own\r\ngreat cathedrals dominated England in the Middle Ages. Yet in Southern\r\nIndia, Hinduism has not assumed the aggressive character which it has\r\ndeveloped in other regions. Perhaps it feels too secure of the\r\nunchallenged supremacy which it has enjoyed through the ages as a social\r\nand religious force without ever aspiring to direct political\r\nascendancy. Perhaps the admixture of Dravidian blood has imparted to it\r\na more serene tolerance. Perhaps it appreciates more fully the relief\r\nfrom the turmoils strife, and bloodshed which was brought to Southern\r\nIndia by the advent of British rule. Compare the legend of a pre-British\r\n\"golden age\" propagated by Tilak and his disciples in the Deccan and in\r\nBengal with the remarkable picture of the condition of Southern India at\r\nthe time when the British power first appeared on the scene which was\r\ndrawn by a Madras Brahman, the late Mr. Srinivasaraghava Iyangar:--\r\n\r\n   Southern India had been devastated by wars, famines,\r\n   and bands of plunderers; the cultivating classes were ground\r\n   down by oppressive taxation, by the illegal exactions of the\r\n   officers of Government, of the renters employed to collect\r\n   the Government dues, and of the sowkars without whose\r\n   assistance the ryots could not subsist and carry on their\r\n   calling, and who kept them in a state little removed from\r\n   perpetual bondage; trade was hampered by insecurity of\r\n   property, defective communications, and onerous transit\r\n   duties; the vast majority of the population suffered extreme\r\n   hardships when there was even a partial failure of crops in\r\n   small tracts, owing to the great difficulty and cost of obtaining\r\n   supplies of grain from more favoured regions; the peasantry\r\n   and even possessors of considerable landed property, when not\r\n   holding office under Government themselves, were cowering\r\n   before the pettiest Government officer and submitting to\r\n   tortures and degrading personal ill-treatment inflicted on the\r\n   slightest pretext; persons who had chanced to acquire\r\n   wealth, if they belonged to the lower classes, dared not openly\r\n   use it for purposes of enjoyment or display for fear of being\r\n   plundered by the classes above them; the agricultural classes\r\n   as a whole had few wants beyond those imposed by the\r\n   necessity for bare subsistence, no ambition or enterprise to\r\n   try untrodden ways, and no example to stimulate them to\r\n   endeavour to better their condition, while the rigid usages\r\n   of castes and communities in which society was organized\r\n   repressed all freedom of action and restricted the scope for\r\n   individual initiative. To understand the full significance\r\n   of the change which has come over the country one has to\r\n   contrast what he sees at present, unsatisfactory as it may\r\n   appear from some points of view, with the state of things\r\n   described above.... Remembering that methods of\r\n   progress calculated to evoke national feeling and religious\r\n   enthusiasm are unavailable under the conditions of the case,\r\n   the progress that has been made ... is little short of\r\n   marvellous.\r\n\r\nIt was from Madras that the British power set forth on its\r\nunpremeditated course of conquest which was destined ultimately to\r\nreach from Tuticorin to the Himalayas. Since the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century the Madras Presidency has been in the fortunate\r\nposition of having no history. Its northern rivals call it despitefully\r\nthe \"benighted\" Presidency. No epithet, however, could be more\r\nundeserved, for if its annals for the last hundred years have been\r\nunsensational, its record in respect of education, intelligent\r\nadministration, material prosperity, and all that goes with peaceful\r\ncontinuous progress would entitle it rather to be called the \"Model\"\r\nPresidency. The Native States of Southern India, and above all Mysore,\r\nwhich was for many years under direct British administration, will\r\nequally bear favourable comparison with any of the Native States of\r\nCentral or Northern India. From the standpoint of education, Southern\r\nIndia has long held and probably still holds the lead, thanks in a great\r\nmeasure to the large Christian communities which comprise more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole Christian population of India. But in the\r\nstatistics of literacy based on the last census, the Brahmans figure at\r\nthe head of all the Hindu castes with the very creditable proportion of\r\n578 males and 40 females per mille. The Western-educated classes in\r\nSouthern India, whilst as progressive as in any other part, show greater\r\nmental balance than in Bengal, and less reactionary tendencies than in\r\nthe Deccan. Western education has been a steady and perhaps on the whole\r\na more solid growth in Southern India. It has produced a large number of\r\nable and distinguished public servants of unimpeachable loyalty to the\r\nBritish _raj_. The harvest yielded by the ingermination of Western ideas\r\nhas produced fewer tares. Educated Hindus of the higher castes have\r\nplayed an important part in social reform, and many of them have been\r\nassociated with the moderate section of the Indian National Congress.\r\nThe enthusiastic reception given to Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal, during his\r\nshort crusade at Madras three years ago on behalf of _Swaraj_, showed\r\nthat, especially amongst the younger generation, there is at least an\r\nappreciable minority who are ready to listen to the doctrines of\r\nadvanced Nationalism, and the existence of inflammable materials was\r\nrevealed in the riots which occurred not long afterwards at Tinnevelly\r\nand Tuticorin, and again a year later at Guntur. But these appear to\r\nhave been merely sporadic outbreaks which were promptly quelled, and the\r\nundisturbed peace which has prevailed since then throughout Southern\r\nIndia, at a time when whole provinces in other parts have been\r\nhoneycombed with sedition, is one of the most encouraging features of\r\nthe situation. There is in the Hinduism of Southern India a peculiar\r\nelement of conservative quietism to which lawlessness in any form seems\r\nto be repugnant. Probably also the racial cry of \"Arya for the Aryans\"\r\nraised in the North of India as the watchword of an anti-British\r\nmovement is not calculated to rouse the blood of a purely Dravidian\r\npopulation, however powerful the ties created by a common social and\r\nreligious system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nREVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt required nothing less than the shock of a murder perpetrated in the\r\nheart of London to open the eyes of those in authority at home to the\r\nnature of the revolutionary propaganda which has been, and is still\r\nbeing, carried on outside India in sympathy, and often in connivance,\r\nwith the more violent leaders of the anti-British agitation in India\r\nitself. Even now it may be doubted whether they fully realize the\r\nimportance of the support which the extremists receive from outside\r\nIndia. I am not alluding to the moral countenance which the Hindu\r\nreaction has received from eccentric Americans and Europeans on the look\r\nout for any novel religious sensation, or which \"advanced\" politicians\r\nhave derived from sympathetic members of Parliament and journalists in\r\nEngland[13], but to the secret organizations established in Europe and\r\nin America by the Indian extremists themselves as a base for hostile\r\noperations against the British _Raj_. However loudly the extremists\r\nprotest against the importation of Western influences into India they\r\nhave certainly not been too proud to borrow the methods of Western\r\nrevolutionists. They have of all Indians been the most slavish imitators\r\nof the West, as represented, at any rate, by the Irish Fenian and the\r\nRussian anarchist. Their literature is replete with references to both.\r\nTilak took his \"No-rent\" campaign in the Deccan from Ireland, and the\r\nBengalees were taught to believe in the power of the boycott by\r\nillustrations taken from contemporary Irish history. When the informer\r\nGosain was shot dead in Alipur gaol the Nationalists gloried in the\r\ndeed, which had far excelled that of Patrick O'Donnell, who shot dead\r\nJames Carey, the approver in the Phoenix Park murders, inasmuch as\r\nGosain had been murdered before he could complete his \"treachery,\"\r\nwhereas the murder of Carey had been only a tardy \"retribution\" which\r\ncould not undo the past. The use of the bomb has become the common\r\nproperty of revolutionists all over the world, but the employment of\r\namateur dacoits, or armed bands of robbers, for replenishing the\r\nrevolutionary war-chest has been directly taken from the revolutionary\r\nmovement in Russia a few years ago. The annals of the Italian\r\n_risorgimento_ have also been put under contribution, and whilst there\r\nis no Indian life of Cavour, Lajpat Rai's Life of Mazzini and Vinayak\r\nSavarkar's translation of Mazzini's Autobiography are favourite\r\nNationalist text-books of the milder order. European works on various\r\nperiods of revolutionary history figure almost invariably amongst\r\nseizures of a far more compromising character whenever the Indian police\r\nraids some centre of Nationalist activity. Hence in the literature of\r\nunrest one frequently comes across the strangest juxtaposition of names,\r\nHindu deities, and Cromwell and Washington, and celebrated anarchists\r\nall being invoked in the same breath.\r\n\r\nEqually foreign in its origin has been the establishment of various\r\ncentres of revolutionary activity outside of India. In America there\r\nappear to be two distinct organizations both having their headquarters\r\nin California, and branches in Chicago, New York, and other important\r\ncities. The Indo-American Association runs an English periodical, _Free\r\nHindustan_, which was originally started in Canada and thence\r\ntransferred to Seattle when it began to attract the attention of the\r\nCanadian authorities. The moving spirits are students, chiefly from\r\nBengal, who have found ready helpers amongst the Irish-American Fenians.\r\nThey have also been able to make not a few converts amongst the\r\nunfortunate British Indian immigrants who suffered heavily from the\r\nanti-Asiatic campaign along the Pacific slope, and some of these\r\nconverts, being Sikhs and old soldiers, were of special value, as\r\nthrough them direct contact could be established with the regiments to\r\nwhich they had belonged, or, at any rate, with the classes from which an\r\nimportant section of the native army is recruited. Large quantities of\r\nseditious leaflets, circulated broadcast three years ago amongst Sepoys,\r\nwere printed in America. The other organization, called the Young Indian\r\nAssociation, with \"head centres\" and \"inner\" and \"outer circles\" that\r\nhave a genuine Fenian ring, is even more \"extreme,\" and is connected\r\nwith the \"Indian Red Flag\" in India, to which Khudiram Bose, who\r\nmurdered Mrs. and Miss Kennedy at Muzafferpur, and other young fanatics\r\nof the same type belonged. The Young Indian Association seems to devote\r\nitself chiefly to the study of explosives and to smuggling arms into\r\nIndia. In Anglo-Indian official circles extreme reticence is naturally\r\nobserved in these matters, but from other sources I have seen evidence\r\nto show that both these associations were in frequent communication with\r\nthe seditious Press all over India, in the Deccan as well as in Bengal\r\nand in the Punjab.\r\n\r\nThe emergence of Japan has created so powerful an impression in India\r\nthat one is not surprised to find the Indian revolutionaries, who live\r\nfor the most part in the dreamland of their own ignorance, looking in\r\nthat quarter for guidance and even, perhaps, for assistance. But they\r\nhave been sorely disappointed. Indian students are well received in\r\nJapan, but they are in nowise specially petted or pampered, and when\r\nthey begin to air their political opinions and to declaim against\r\nBritish rule they are very speedily put in their place. Crossing the\r\nPacific from Japan to America last year I met one who had spent two or\r\nthree years at Tokyo and was going on to continue his technical studies\r\nin the United States. He was a pleasant and intelligent young fellow,\r\nand confessed to me that what he had seen in Japan had very much\r\nmodified the views he had held when he left Bengal as to the ripeness of\r\nhis fellow-countrymen for independence or self-government. He had\r\nreceived a great deal of kindness from his Japanese professors, but the\r\ngeneral attitude of the Japanese was by no means friendly, and there was\r\nno trace of sympathy with the political agitation in India. There is an\r\nIndo-Japanese Society in Tokyo, but it has no connexion with politics,\r\nand the Indians complain that it is run for the benefit of the Japanese\r\nrather than for theirs. Those who have joined it in the hope of using it\r\nas a base for anti-British operations have certainly got very little for\r\ntheir pains. They occasionally write articles for the very few Socialist\r\npapers of Japan, but their effective contribution to the cause is of\r\ntrifling account.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous organization outside India was unquestionably that\r\nwhich had its headquarters at the \"India House\" at Highgate. It was\r\nthere that Dinghra appears to have concocted the plot which resulted in\r\nthe murder of Sir W. Curzon Wyllie and Dr. Lalcaca, and though the\r\nLondon correspondent of the _Kal_, Vinayak Savarkar, who was arrested\r\nthis year in London to take his trial on the gravest charges at Bombay,\r\nmagnified the success of the plot by describing its chief victim as \"the\r\neyes of the Secretary of State through which he saw all Indian affairs,\"\r\nthere is some reason to believe that Dinghra expected to find at the\r\nreception another Anglo-Indian official whom the \"extremists\" were\r\nparticularly anxious to \"remove,\" and only in his absence struck at Sir\r\nW. Curzon Wyllie. There is reason, too, to believe that it was from this\r\n\"India House\" also that came both the idea of murdering Mr. Jackson and\r\nthe weapons used by the murderer. Though students from all parts of\r\nIndia were enticed into the \"India House,\" the organization seems to\r\nhave been controlled by Deccan Brahmans, and in the first instance by\r\nShyamji Krishnavarma, who founded scholarships in connexion with it to\r\nhonour the Indian \"martyrs\" executed for murderous outrages in India.\r\nWhen the authorities in London very tardily awoke after the murder of\r\nSir W. Curzon Wyllie to the dangerous nature of this organization, to\r\nwhich _The Times_ first drew attention in the spring of 1908, it was\r\nstill controlled from the Continent by Krishnavarma, who had retreated\r\nto Paris long before, leaving his lieutenants to carry on his campaign\r\namongst the young Indian students. The _Indian Sociologist_ itself\r\ncontinued to be openly published in London and to advocate assassination\r\nuntil the tragedy at the Imperial Institute led the authorities to take\r\nwoefully-belated action in prosecuting successively two printers of the\r\nsheet, which was then transferred to Paris.\r\n\r\nThat altogether considerable quantities of incendiary literature have\r\nbeen produced abroad and imported into India through these various\r\norganizations is beyond doubt. Sometimes books like Savarkar's \"War of\r\nIndian Independence of 1857\"--in its way a very remarkable history of\r\nthe Mutiny, combining considerable research with the grossest\r\nperversions of facts and great literary power with the most savage\r\nhatred--were bound in false covers as \"Pickwick Papers,\" or other\r\nequally innocuous works. Other seditious leaflets besides those for the\r\nincitement of mutiny in the native army appear to have come from\r\nAmerica, whilst newspapers like the _Talvar_ and the _Bande Mataram_,\r\nwhich preach the same gospel of murder as Krishnavarrna's _Indian\r\nSociologist_, are printed on the Continent of Europe. These papers are\r\neither smuggled into India in large parcels or sent through the post in\r\nenvelopes addressed by name to students in schools and colleges, as well\r\nas to schoolmasters, pleaders, Government _employés_--in fact, to all\r\nsorts and conditions of people who, for some reason or other, are\r\nsupposed to be suitable recipients. They naturally fall sometimes into\r\nquite the wrong hands.\r\n\r\nThe importance which the \"extremists\" attach to the maintenance of these\r\nchannels of communication with India appears from the following extract\r\nfrom the March issue of the _Bande Mataram_, which purports to be\r\npublished in Geneva, and calls itself \"a monthly organ of Indian\r\nindependence\":--\r\n\r\n   We must recognize at present that the importation of\r\n   revolutionary literature into India is the sheet-anchor of\r\n   the party. It keeps up the spirit of all young men, and\r\n   assures them that the party is living. We must therefore\r\n   try to strengthen all groups of workers outside India. The\r\n   centre of gravity of political work has been shifted from\r\n   Calcutta, Poona, and Lahore to Paris, Geneva, Berlin, London,\r\n   and New York. The Wahabi conspiracy of 1862 was completely\r\n   crushed because there was no centre in foreign\r\n   countries where the work could be carried on during the period\r\n   of persecution. We must take this lesson to heart, that if\r\n   we desire to hear more of the murder of British officials as\r\n   a token of the progress and vitality of the party we must\r\n   strengthen and establish centres of work in many foreign\r\n   countries. The circulation of revolutionary leaflets, journals,\r\n   and manifestoes should be looked upon as a sacred duty\r\n   by all patriots. We are not exaggerating the importance\r\n   of this work when we use that expression. Let us look upon\r\n   every leaf of revolutionary literature with almost superstitious\r\n   veneration and try to make it reach India by all\r\n   means in our power. For it is the seed of life of our\r\n   people, &c.\r\n\r\nAs to the importation of arms into India, the murder of Mr. Jackson,\r\n\"another Nationalist fête celebrated at Nasik amidst the rejoicings of\r\nall true patriots,\" furnishes an occasion for similar exultation:--\r\n\r\n   We know that the hero possessed Browning pistols. Now\r\n   these pistols are not manufactured in India, but in Europe.\r\n   How have they been imported by the revolutionaries? It\r\n   is clear that this fact is a testimony to the efficiency of our\r\n   organization and the secrecy of our activity. Besides, the\r\n   imported arms are not the only weapons on which we have\r\n   to rely. Daggers can be manufactured in India out of sharp\r\n   nails to stab all vile agents of the British Government, English\r\n   or Indian.\r\n\r\nIncreased vigilance in this country as well as in the Indian Customs and\r\nPost Offices is, however, beginning to check these importations, and\r\nonly two months later the _Bande Mataram_ was already compelled to\r\nstrike a less exuberant note. It declares, of course, that \"our movement\r\ncannot be repressed so long as there are patriotic Indians living under\r\nother flags than the Union Jack,\" but it recognizes that the situation\r\n\"gives rise to anxious thought,\" and it winds up in a somewhat depressed\r\ntone:--\r\n\r\n   We admit that for the present all active propaganda among\r\n   the young men of India with a view to the acquisition of new\r\n   workers is exceedingly difficult. But there are hundreds of\r\n   patriotic Indian students in America and Japan who can be\r\n   inspired with apostolic fervour if only some capable workers\r\n   are sent among them. The harvest is plenteous, but the\r\n   labourers are few. We should now realize that, even if the\r\n   Government succeeds in checkmating us in India at every\r\n   step, there is ample scope for work for several years among\r\n   Indians living abroad. We should reflect that steady work\r\n   is its own reward. We must not imagine that the Idea\r\n   is not making progress because our particular journal cannot\r\n   be circulated, or because those workers whom we know\r\n   personally have been lost. Again, we must not fancy that if\r\n   heroic exploits of political assassination do not occur every\r\n   week the movement will die out.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in regard to the introduction of poisonous literature or\r\nof weapons into India that the activity of these organizations deserves\r\nto be closely and continuously watched. One of their main objects, as\r\nthe _Bande Mataram_ points out, is to gain over young Indians who go\r\nabroad, especially those who go abroad for purposes of study. The India\r\nOffice has recognized the necessity of establishing some organization in\r\nLondon to keep in touch with them and to rescue them from unwholesome\r\ninfluences, political and other. This is a step in the right direction,\r\nbut much more will require to be done, and not only in London.\r\nCommittees should be formed in other centres, and public-spirited\r\nEnglishmen abroad could not do more useful work than by social service\r\nof this kind. If we want to do any real and permanent good we must\r\nspread our nets as wide as the revolutionists have spread theirs. In\r\nParis, for instance, Krishnavarma has set up, since he migrated to the\r\nother side of the Channel, an organization for waylaying and\r\nindoctrinating young Indians on their way to England, so as to induce\r\nthem to hold aloof from those who would wish to be their friends when\r\nthey arrive in London. The number of Indian students abroad is bound to\r\ngo on increasing, especially with the growing demand for scientific and\r\ntechnical education for which the provision hitherto made in India is\r\nregarded as inadequate. Indian parents and Indian associations that\r\nought to know better are apt to think that, if they can only provide for\r\na youth's travelling expenses, he will somehow be able afterwards to\r\nshift for himself. It is not infrequently the misery and distress to\r\nwhich he thus finds himself reduced abroad that drive the young Indian\r\ninto political recklessness, or, at least, render him peculiarly liable\r\nto temptation. British manufacturers might also render valuable\r\nassistance. Indian parents complain that, owing to the resentment which\r\ncrimes like the murder of Sir W. Curzon Wyllie have provoked there is\r\ngreat reluctance now on the part of British firms to admit Indians as\r\napprentices to their works, and that in consequence they are compelled\r\nto go to other countries where they are treated with less suspicion.\r\nThis reluctance is perhaps in reality more often due to the fear lest\r\nyoung Indians should afterwards turn their knowledge to too good an\r\naccount, as the Japanese have often done, in the promotion of competing\r\nindustries in their own country. However that may be, the results are\r\ncertainly regrettable. For, if there is one thing that has impressed\r\nitself on me during my last visit to India, it is that, if we want to\r\nretain our hold, not only upon the country, but upon the people, we must\r\nneglect no opportunity of arresting the estrangement which is growing up\r\nbetween us and the younger generation of Indians. It is upon this\r\nestrangement that the revolutionary organizations outside of India\r\nchiefly rely for the success of their propaganda, and nothing helps them\r\nmore than the bitterness with which young Indians who come abroad often\r\nreturn to India ready for any desperate adventure[14].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to acquit the Congress of having contributed to the\r\ngrowth of active and violent unrest, though the result may have lain far\r\nboth from the purpose of its chief originators and from the desire of\r\nthe majority of its members. Western education has largely failed in\r\nIndia because the Indian, not unnaturally, fails to bring an education\r\nbased upon conceptions entirely alien to the world in which he moves\r\ninto any sort of practical relation with his own life. So with the\r\nIndian politician, who, even with the best intentions, fails to bring\r\nthe political education which he has borrowed from the West into any\r\nsort of practical relation with the political conditions of India.\r\n\r\nThe Indian National Congress assumed unto itself almost from the\r\nbeginning the functions of a Parliament. There was and is no room for a\r\nParliament in India, because, so long as British rule remains a reality,\r\nthe Government of India, as Lord Morley has plainly stated, must be an\r\nautocracy--benevolent and full of sympathy with Indian ideas, but still\r\nan autocracy. Nor would the Congress have been in any way qualified to\r\ndischarge the functions of a Parliament had there been room for one. For\r\nit represents only one class, or rather a section of one class--the\r\nWestern educated middle, and mainly professional, class, consisting\r\nchiefly of lawyers, doctors, schoolmasters, newspaper men; an important\r\nand influential class, no doubt, but one which itself only represents an\r\ninfinitesimal fraction--barely, perhaps, one-hundredth part--of the\r\nwhole population. To what extent it is really representative even of\r\nthat small section it is impossible to say, as the members are not\r\nreturned by any clearly defined body of constituents or by any formal\r\nprocess of election. Originally it attracted the support of not a few\r\nnon-Hindus, though the Hindu element always largely preponderated, and a\r\nsmall group of distinguished Parsees, headed by Mr. Dadhabai Naoroji,\r\ntogether with a sprinkling of Mahomedans, helped to justify its claim to\r\nbe called National, in so far as that appellation connoted the\r\nrepresentation of the different creeds and races of India. But gradually\r\nmost of the Mahomedans dropped out, as it became more and more an\r\nexponent of purely Hindu opinion, and the Parsees retained little more\r\nthan the semblance of the authority they had at one time enjoyed.\r\n\r\nOn broader grounds still the Congress could never be called National in\r\nthe Western democratic sense of the term, for whatever exceptions it may\r\nhave been willing to make in favour of individuals, there can be no\r\nquestion of popular representation in India so long as the Hindu caste\r\nsystem prevails, under which whole classes numbering millions and\r\nmillions are regarded and treated as beyond the pale and actually\r\n\"untouchable.\" From time to time a few enlightened Hindus recognize the\r\nabsurdity of posturing as the champions of democratic ideals so long as\r\nthis monstrous anomaly subsists, but, whilst professing in theory to\r\nrepudiate it, the Indian National Congress has during the whole course\r\nof its existence taken no effective step towards removing it. Nor is the\r\nCongress any more representative of the toiling masses that are not\r\n\"unclean.\" No measures have been more bitterly assailed in the Congress\r\nthan those which, like the Punjab Land Alienation Act of 1900, were\r\nframed and have operated for the benefit of the agricultural and other\r\nhumbler classes--i.e., of the real \"people of India,\" in whose name\r\nthe Congress speaks so loudly and with so little title.\r\n\r\nAn earlier generation of Hindus had fully recognized the urgency of\r\nsocial problems, like that of the \"depressed\" castes, and had realized\r\nthat, until Indians had brought their own customs and beliefs to some\r\nextent into line with the social customs and beliefs of the West, they\r\ncould not hope to raise their political life on to the Western plane.\r\nThe Indian National Congress, unfortunately, succumbed to the specious\r\nplea put forward in an evil hour many years ago by a distinguished\r\nHindu, afterwards a Judge of the Bombay High Court, Mr. K.T. Telang, who\r\nwas himself unquestionably an enlightened social reformer, that the\r\n\"line of least resistance\" was to press for political concessions from\r\nEngland where they had \"friends amongst the garrison,\" instead of\r\nfighting an uphill battle for social reforms against the dead-weight of\r\npopular ignorance and prejudice amongst their own people. That many\r\nmembers of the Congress take part also in social reform conferences and\r\nare fully alive to the importance of social reform cannot alter the fact\r\nthat, by turning its corporate back upon the cause they have at heart,\r\nthe Indian National Congress has arrested instead of promoting one of\r\nthe most promising movements to which Western education had given birth.\r\n\r\nDo not, however, let us throw the blame wholly upon the Congress. For,\r\nlike Mr. Telang, it has been induced to put its trust in \"the friends\r\namongst the garrison\"--Englishmen often of widely different types and\r\ncharacters, like Bradlaugh and Hume and Webb and Sir William Wedderburn,\r\nand in more recent days Sir Henry Cotton and Mr. Mackarness--and upon\r\nthem must rest no small responsibility for the diversion of many of the\r\nbest talents and energies of educated India from the thorny path of\r\nsocial reform into the more popular field of political agitation.\r\n\r\nWhat has been the result? A self-constituted body of Indian gentlemen\r\nwho have no title to represent the people and a very slender title to\r\nrepresent the upper classes of Indian society, but who, as I have\r\nalready said, doubtless represent to some extent a considerable and\r\ninfluential section of Western educated opinion, might have given very\r\nuseful assistance to Anglo-Indian legislators and administrators had\r\nthey devoted themselves to the study of those social problems in the\r\nsolution of which it is peculiarly difficult and dangerous for an alien\r\nGovernment to take any initiative. Instead of that, they set before\r\nthemselves a task that was impossible because they had no _status_ to\r\nperform it. They were fighting all the time in the air, and their\r\nproceedings therefore lacked reality. The Congress was not only an\r\nirresponsible body, but it was never steadied by a healthy divergency of\r\nopinions and the presentation of conflicting arguments. It was not even\r\na debating society, for all represented practically the same interests,\r\nheld the same views, made the same speeches, which there was no one to\r\nquestion or to refute. Hence the monotony of the proceedings, the\r\nsameness of the speeches, sometimes marked with great ability, and\r\ngenerally delivered with much eloquence and fervour, at the short annual\r\nsessions. The proceedings were usually controlled by a small caucus who\r\ndrew up long-winded resolutions, often embodying half a score of\r\nresolutions carried in previous sessions. Some one delivered a\r\nsoul-stirring oration, and then the \"omnibus\" resolution, which was not\r\neven always read out, was put to the vote and passed unanimously. Every\r\none knew beforehand that every speaker would attack the policy of\r\nGovernment, whether he dealt with the ancient stock grievances or with\r\nsome new question raised by the legislative and administrative measures\r\nof the current year; and every one knew also that all the others would\r\napplaud. There was no other way of bidding for popularity and making a\r\nmark than by achieving pre-eminence in the arts of pungent criticism and\r\nexuberant rhetoric. Behind the scenes there were, doubtless, often\r\nfierce fights and jealousies, and the struggles _in camera_ are reported\r\nto have been sometimes very violent and bitter. But an unbroken front\r\nwas maintained to the outside world, and the divisions which ultimately\r\nalmost shipwrecked the Congress very rarely showed themselves on the\r\nsurface of its proceedings till nearly 20 years after its birth.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Government who had accepted the Congress's assurances of\r\nloyalty, and recognized its aims, as defined by it, to be \"perfectly\r\nlegitimate in themselves,\" was laid down for the first time officially\r\nin 1890, under Lord Lansdowne's Viceroyalty, in terms that were\r\ncertainly not hostile:--\r\n\r\n   The Government of India recognize that the Congress\r\n   movement is regarded as representing in India what in Europe\r\n   would be called the more advanced Liberal Party as distinguished\r\n   from the great body of Conservative opinion which\r\n   exists side by side with it. They desire themselves to maintain\r\n   an attitude of neutrality in their relations with both\r\n   parties, so long as these act strictly within constitutional limits.\r\n\r\nTo the principles of that declaration the Government of India has\r\nstrictly adhered ever since, even when, as in 1905, the Congress might\r\nhave been deemed to have over-stepped those constitutional limits by\r\nendorsing the Bengalee doctrine of boycott.\r\n\r\nThough the majority of the Congress probably glided unconsciously or\r\nwithout any deliberate purpose from, its earlier attitude of\r\nremonstrance and entreaty into violent denunciation of Government and\r\nall its works, there had always been a small group determined to drive\r\nor to manoeuvre their colleagues as a body into an attitude of open and\r\nirreconcilable hostility. That group was headed by Tilak, the strongest\r\npersonality in Indian politics, who was gradually making recruits among\r\nthe more ardent spirits all over India. On one occasion, as far back as\r\n1895, when the Congress held its annual session in his own city of\r\nPoona, he had attempted to commit it to the aggressive doctrines which\r\nhe was already preaching in the Deccan, but he soon discovered that the\r\ntemper of the majority was against him. He was, however, far too\r\ntenacious ever to accept defeat. He bided his time. He knew he had to\r\nreckon with powerful personal jealousies, and he remained in the\r\nbackground. His opportunity did not come till ten years later when he\r\npulled the strings at the two successive sessions held in 1905 at\r\nBenares and in 1906 at Calcutta. It was then that the Congress passed\r\nfrom mere negative antagonism into almost direct defiance of Government.\r\nIt must have been a proud moment for Tilak when the very man who had\r\noften fought so courageously against his inflammatory methods and\r\nreactionary tendencies in the Deccan, Mr. Gokhale, played into his\r\nhands, and from the presidential chair at Benares got up to commend the\r\nboycott as a political weapon used for a definite political purpose. A\r\nyear later, it is true, Mr. Gokhale and the \"moderate\" party in the\r\nCongress, who had seen in the meantime to what lawlessness the boycott\r\nwas leading, were anxious to undo or to mitigate at the Calcutta session\r\nwhat they had helped to do at Benares. But again, by dint of lobbying\r\nand even more by threatening to break up the Congress, Tilak carried the\r\nday, and a resolution was passed in the form upon which he insisted to\r\nthe effect that the boycott movement was legitimate. It was not till the\r\nfollowing year at Surat, after the preaching of lawlessness had begun to\r\nyield its inevitable harvest of crime, that the \"moderates\" recoiled at\r\nlast from the quicksands into which the \"extremists\" were leading them.\r\nTilak, however, carried out his threat, and he and his friends wrecked\r\nthat session of the Congress amidst scenes of disgraceful riot and\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nYet even after this the \"moderates\" lacked the courage of their\r\nconvictions. The breach has never been altogether repaired, but there\r\nhave been frequent negotiations and exchanges of courtesies. In the very\r\nnext year at Madras a man as incapable of promoting or approving\r\ncriminal forms of agitation as Dr. Rash Behari Ghose was holding out the\r\nolive branch to \"the wayward wanderers\" who had treated him so\r\ndespitefully at Surat; and last year at Lahore, when Pandit Mohan\r\nMalavya was expounding from the chair the latest formula adopted by\r\nCongress as a definition of its aims, his chief anxiety seemed to be to\r\nprove that it offered no obstacle to the return of the Surat insurgents\r\nto the fold. This formula, it may be mentioned, lays down that \"the\r\nobjects of the Indian National Congress are the attainment by the people\r\nof India of a system of Government similar to that enjoyed by the\r\nself-governing members of the British Empire and a participation by them\r\nin the rights and responsibilities of the Empire on equal terms.\" This\r\nis a formula which many \"moderates\" no doubt construe in a spirit of\r\ngenuine loyalty, but it does not exclude the construction which more\r\n\"advanced\" politicians like Mr. Pal place upon _Swaraj_.\r\n\r\nThe last session of the Congress at Lahore, in December last, is\r\ngenerally admitted to have aroused very little enthusiasm, and there are\r\nmany who believe that, weakened as it has been by recent dissensions, it\r\nwill scarcely survive the creation of the new enlarged Councils. These\r\nCouncils have been so constituted that they will be able to discharge\r\nusefully the functions which the Congress arrogated to itself without\r\nany title or authority. Perhaps it was the consciousness that the\r\nCongress would at any rate be henceforth overshadowed by the new\r\nCouncils that led Pandit Malavya to inveigh so bitterly in his\r\npresidential address at Lahore against the shape ultimately given to the\r\nreforms. What one may hope above all is that the Councils will help to\r\ngive the Indian \"moderates\" a little more self-reliance than they have\r\nhitherto shown. The Indian National Congress has at all times contained\r\nmany men of high character and ability, devoted to what they conceived\r\nto be the best interests of their country, and at first, at any rate,\r\nquite ready to acknowledge the benefits of British rule and to testify\r\nto their conviction that the maintenance of British rule is essential to\r\nthe welfare and safety of India. Many of them must have seen that the\r\nconstant denunciation of Government by men who claimed to represent the\r\nintelligence of the country must tend to stimulate a spirit of\r\ndisaffection and revolt amongst their more ignorant and inexperienced\r\nfellow-countrymen. Yet not one of them had the courage to face the risk\r\nof temporary unpopularity by pointing out the danger of the inclined\r\nplane down which they were sliding, until they actually saw themselves\r\nbeing swept hopelessly off their feet at Surat. It was then too late to\r\navert the consequences of pusillanimity or to shake off their share of\r\nresponsibility for the evils which the tolerance they had too long\r\nextended to the methods of their more violent colleagues had helped to\r\nproduce. One of the main purposes of the Indian National Congress has\r\navowedly been to set up a claim for the introduction of representative\r\ngovernment in India. Yet it has itself seldom escaped the control of a\r\nhandful of masterful leaders who have ruled it in the most irresponsible\r\nand despotic fashion. The Congress has, in fact, displayed exactly the\r\nsame feature which has been so markedly manifested in the case of\r\nmunicipalities, namely, the tendency of \"representative\" institutions in\r\nIndia to resolve themselves into machines operated by, and for the\r\nbenefit of, an extremely limited and domineering oligarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Minto closed at the end of March the first Session of the\r\nImperial Council, as the Viceroy's Legislative Council, enlarged under\r\nthe Indian Councils Act of 1909, is now officially designated, in\r\ncontradistinction to the enlarged Provincial Councils of Provincial\r\nGovernments, his Excellency very properly described it as \"a memorable\r\nSession.\" It was, indeed, far more than that. Even to the outward eye\r\nthe old Council Chamber at Government House presented a very significant\r\nspectacle, to which the portrait of Warren Hastings over the Viceregal\r\nChair always seemed to add a strange note of admiration. The round table\r\nat which the members of the Viceroy's Legislative Council used to\r\ngather, with far less of formality, had disappeared, and the 59 members\r\nof the enlarged Council had their appointed seats disposed in a double\r\nhemicycle facing the Chair. They sat for the most part according to\r\nprovinces, and the features as well as, in some cases, the dresses, of\r\nthe Indian members showed at a glance how representative this new\r\nCouncil really was.\r\n\r\nThe tall burly frame of the Kuvar Sahib of Patiala was only more\r\nconspicuous than that of the Maharajah of Burdawan because the former\r\nwore the many-folded turban and brocaded dress of his Sikh ancestry,\r\nwhereas the latter, like most Bengalees of the upper classes, has\r\nadopted the much more commonplace broadcloth of the West. The bold,\r\nhawk-like features of Malik Umar Hyat Khan of Tiwana in the Punjab were\r\nas characteristic of the fighting Pathan from the North as were the\r\nRajah of Mahmudabad's more delicate features of the Mahomedan\r\naristocracy of the erstwhile kingdom of Oudh. The white _swadeshi_\r\ngarments affected by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, from the United\r\nProvinces--who opened the last meeting of the Indian National Congress\r\nat Lahore with a presidential address which lasted for two hours and a\r\nquarter, and wound up with an apology for its brevity on the ground that\r\nhe had had no time to prepare it--testified, at any rate more loudly, to\r\nthe sternness of his patriotic convictions than the equally _swadeshi_\r\nhomespun, cut at least in European fashion, of another \"advanced\"\r\npolitician, Mr. Bhupendranath Bose, of Bengal. More worthy of attention\r\nwas the keen, refined, and intellectual face of Mr. G.K. Gokhale, the\r\nDeccanee Brahman with the Mahratta cap, who, by education, belongs to\r\nthe West quite as much as to the East, and, by birth, to the ruling\r\ncaste of the last dominant race before the advent of the British _Raj_.\r\nThe red fez worn by the majority of Mahomedan members showed that their\r\ncommunity had certainly not failed in this instance to secure the\r\ngenerous measure of representation which Lord Minto spontaneously\r\npromised to them three years ago at Simla. The peculiar glazed black\r\nheaddress of the Parsee and the silk kerchief of the Burman in turn\r\nindicated the racial catholicity of the assembly in which Sir Sassoon\r\nDavid, of Bombay, worthily represents, by his authority as a financier,\r\nthe small Jewish community of India.\r\n\r\nNor were the different interests and classes, with two important\r\nexceptions, less adequately represented than the different races and\r\ncreeds. Besides the great territorial magnates, of whom I have already\r\nmentioned two or three by name, there were not a few other well-known\r\nrepresentatives of the landed interests which, in a country like India\r\nwhere agriculture is still the greatest of all national industries, have\r\na special claim to respectful hearing, even though they have hitherto\r\nfor the most part held aloof from the fashionable methods of political\r\nagitation. There was indeed a good deal of disappointment among the\r\nurban professional classes, in whose eyes a Western education--or rather\r\neducation on what are, often quite erroneously, conceived to be Western\r\nlines--should apparently constitute the one indispensable qualification\r\nfor public life. But they too had secured no inconsiderable number of\r\nseats, and if the voice of the Indian National Congress did not\r\npredominate it had certainly not been reduced to silence.\r\n\r\nDoubts were freely expressed among Englishmen before the meetings of the\r\nnew Councils as to the competence of the Anglo-Indian officials for the\r\nnovel duties allotted to them in these assemblies. It was argued, not\r\nunreasonably, that men who had never been trained or accustomed to take\r\npart in public discussions might find themselves at a disadvantage in\r\ncontroversial encounters with the quick-witted Hindu politician. It is\r\ngenerally admitted now that the first Session at any rate of the\r\nImperial Council by no means justified any such apprehensions. Not a few\r\nofficial members, it is true, were inclined at first to rely exclusively\r\nupon their written notes, and there was indeed, from beginning to end,\r\nbut little room for the rapid thrust and skilled parry of debate to\r\nwhich we are accustomed at Westminster. Most of the Indian members\r\nthemselves had carefully prepared their speeches beforehand, and read\r\nthem out from typed or even printed drafts before them. In many cases\r\nthe speeches had been communicated two or three days ahead to the Press,\r\nand sometimes a speech was printed and commented upon in the favoured\r\norgan of some honourable member, though he had ultimately changed his\r\nmind and preserved silence, without, however, informing the editor of\r\nthe fact. In other cases a speech was published without the\r\ninterruptions and calls to order which had compelled the orator to drop\r\nout some of his most cherished periods. As it was the custom for Indian\r\nmembers to communicate also to the departments immediately concerned the\r\ngist of the remarks which they proposed to make, the official members\r\nwere tempted at first to frame their replies on similar lines and to\r\nread out elaborate statements bristling with figures, which would have\r\nbeen much more suitable for circulation as printed minutes. But\r\ngradually many of them took courage and showed that they could speak\r\neasily and simply, and quite as effectively as most of the Indian\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nIndeed, one of the best speeches of this kind was that delivered on the\r\nlast day but one of the Session by Mr. P.C. Lyon, a nominated member for\r\nEastern Bengals, in reply to the fervid oration of Mr. Bupendranath Bose\r\non the threadbare topic of Partition. On this, as on other occasions,\r\nthe florid style of eloquence cultivated by the leaders of the Indian\r\nNational Congress fell distinctly flat in the calmer atmosphere of the\r\nCouncil-room, as indeed Mr. Gokhale warned some of his friends it was\r\nbound to do. During the last two days discussion was allowed somewhat\r\nneedlessly under the new rules, to roam at large over all manner of\r\nirrelevant subjects, but on this occasion it served at least one useful\r\npurpose. If it were not that the Bengalee politician has no other\r\ngrievance to substitute for it, the question of the Partition of Bengal\r\nshould, one would think, have received its _quietus_, for two excellent\r\nspeeches, delivered with much simple force by Maulvi Syed Shams ul Huda,\r\nMahomedan member for Eastern Bengal, and by Mr. Mazhar-ul-Haq, another\r\nMahomedan who sits for Bengal, completed the discomfiture which poor Mr.\r\nBose had already experienced at Mr. Lyon's hands.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that amongst the Indian members it was the politician,\r\nand especially the more \"advanced\" politician, who figured most\r\nprominently in the discussions. The more conservative Indians were\r\nusually content to listen, with more or less visible signs of weariness,\r\nto the facile and sometimes painfully long-winded eloquence of their\r\ncolleagues. When they did intervene, however, their speeches were\r\nusually short and none the less effective. In most of the divisions that\r\nwere taken they supported the Government, and in no single instance was\r\nthe Government majority hard pressed. The minority in support of any\r\nresolution resisted by Government never reached 20, and generally\r\nfluctuated somewhere between 16 and 20. The only resolution which would\r\nhave certainly combined all the native members in support of it was Mr.\r\nGokhale's resolution with regard to the position of British Indians in\r\nSouth Africa, but, as it was accepted by Government, it was passed _nem.\r\ncon._ without a division.\r\n\r\nThat in these circumstances the official members who are at the same\r\ntime heads of the most important administrative and executive\r\ndepartments should be kept in constant attendance during debates in\r\nwhich many of them, are not in any way directly concerned, and that they\r\nshould thus be detained in Calcutta at a season when their presence\r\nwould be far more useful elsewhere, constitutes one of the most serious\r\nof the many practical drawbacks of the new system for which a remedy\r\nwill have to be found. It is as if not only the Parliamentary\r\nrepresentatives but the permanent officials of our own great public\r\ndepartments were expected to sit through the debates in the House of\r\nCommons, without even the facilities which the private rooms of\r\nMinisters, the library, and the smoking rooms at Westminster afford for\r\nquiet intervals of work between the division bells. Nor is that all. The\r\nCouncil sat during the very months of the short \"cold weather,\" when it\r\nis customary and alone practicable for heads of departments to undertake\r\ntheir annual tours of inspection. The _reductio ad absurdum_ is surely\r\nreached in the case of the Commander-in-Chief and the Chief of the\r\nStaff. Though the Imperial Council is itself debarred from dealing with\r\nArmy questions, they could be seen any day sitting through the debates\r\nmerely because their votes might conceivably be required to maintain the\r\nofficial majority, and, except for one or two short excursions in the\r\nintervals between the meetings of Council, they were tied to Calcutta\r\nwhen they ought to have been travelling about the country and inspecting\r\nthe troops. Yet, it is generally admitted that at no period since the\r\nMutiny has it been more important for the Commander-in-Chief to maintain\r\nthe closest possible contact with the native army--especially when the\r\nCommander-in-Chief is as popular with the Indian soldier as Sir O'Moore\r\nCreagh.\r\n\r\nAnother obvious drawback of the present arrangements is the\r\ninconvenience to which members of Council from the provinces were\r\nsubjected by the irregular intervals at which the Council held its\r\nactual sittings. Either they had to waste their time at Calcutta during\r\nthe intervals, to the detriment of their interests at home, or they had\r\nto spend days in railway carriages rushing backwards and forwards from\r\ntheir homes to the capital, for in a country of such magnificent\r\ndistances there are few journeys that take less than 24 hours, and from\r\nCalcutta, for instance, either to Madras or to Bombay takes the best\r\npart of 48 hours. Unless arrangements are remodelled so as to enable the\r\nCouncil to transact its business, whether _in pleno_ or in committee,\r\neither in one session or in two short sessions, but in any case\r\ncontinuously, many of its most valuable members, who have important\r\nbusiness, of their own which they cannot afford to neglect, will cease\r\nto attend, and the Council will not only lose much of the representative\r\ncharacter, which is one of its best features at present, but will fall\r\ninevitably under the preponderating influence of the professional\r\npolitician. In his closing speech Lord Minto outlined a scheme which\r\nwould in some measure meet this difficulty, but it is doubtful whether\r\nit will prove by any means adequate. Another point which requires\r\nconsideration is whether it is desirable for the Viceroy to preside\r\nhimself over the deliberations of the Council. Even if he could properly\r\nafford the time for it, it seems hardly expedient that the immediate\r\nrepresentative of the King-Emperor should be drawn into the arena of\r\npublic controversies. Proceedings are bound to grow more and more\r\ncontentious, and delicate questions of procedure will arise and have to\r\nbe settled from the chair. These are all matters in which the Viceroy\r\nshould not be committed to the premature exercise, on the spur of the\r\nmoment, of his supreme authority.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief purposes which the creation of the new Councils is\r\nintended to achieve is that of enlightening Indian opinion throughout\r\nthe country by means of the enlarged opportunities given for the\r\ndiscussion of public affairs. But that purpose will be defeated unless\r\nthe discussions receive adequate publicity. They certainly did not do so\r\nthis winter. Not only is the art of gallery reporting still in its\r\ninfancy, but many of the Indian newspapers have still to learn that \"it\r\nis not cricket\" to report only the speeches of their political friends\r\nand to omit or compress into a few lines the speeches of their\r\nadversaries. A glaring instance of this shortcoming was afforded by the\r\n_Bengalee_. The Nationalist organ published Mr. Bupendra Nath Bose's\r\nspeech on the partition of Bengal _in extenso_, as he had intended to\r\ndeliver it, without taking the slightest notice of the fact that he was\r\nrepeatedly called to order by the Viceroy and had in consequence to drop\r\nout whole passages of his oration, and it published practically nothing\r\nelse--though perhaps no other indictment of the Government during the\r\nwhole session was more successfully refuted, both by the official\r\nspokesman, Mr. Lyon, and by other Indian members. Apart, however, from\r\nany such deliberate unfairness, the communication of speeches in advance\r\nto the Press should be strenuously discountenanced. Many official\r\nmembers showed that they could perfectly well dispense with the\r\ndoubtful advantage of knowing beforehand exactly what their critics were\r\ngoing to say, and, if once this practice is stopped, newspapers,\r\nrelieved from the temptation of giving undue preference to easy \"copy,\"\r\nwill learn to cultivate and to rely upon more legitimate methods of\r\nreporting. It is to be hoped also that the _Gazette of India_, which\r\npublishes the official verbatim reports, will not in future lag so far\r\nbehind the actual proceedings.\r\n\r\nAll these are minor points. The dominant feature of the Session was that\r\nin spite of wide divergences of views, the proceedings were generally\r\ndignified, sometimes even to the verge of dulness, and with one or two\r\nexceptions they were marked by good feeling on all sides. It would be\r\nunfair not to give to Mr. Gokhale his full share of credit for this\r\nhappy result. Though often an unrelenting critic of the Administration,\r\nhe struck from the first a note of studied moderation and restraint to\r\nwhich most of his political friends attuned their utterances. He\r\nnaturally assumed the functions of the leader of his Majesty's\r\nOpposition, and he discharged them, not only with the ability which\r\nevery one expected of him, but with the urbanity and self-restraint of a\r\nman conscious of his responsibilities as well as of his powers. His was,\r\namongst the Indian members, not only the master mind, but the dominant\r\npersonality. The European members, on the other hand, showed themselves\r\ninvariably courteous and good-tempered, and not a few awkward corners\r\nwere turned by a little good-humoured banter. Nor was it unusual to see\r\nthe Englishman come and sit down by the side of the Indian member to\r\nwhose indictment he had just been replying, and in friendly conversation\r\ntake all personal sting out of the controversy. As Lord Minto aptly put\r\nit, the Council-room \"has brought people together. Official and\r\nnon-official members have met each other. The official wall which of\r\nnecessity to some extent separated them has been broken down. They have\r\ntalked over many things together.\" From this point of view, if future\r\nsessions fulfil the promise of the first one, the Imperial Council may\r\ngrow into a potent instrument for good.\r\n\r\nOf the deeper significance which underlay the meeting of this remarkable\r\nassembly it is still perhaps premature to speak. But cautious and\r\ntentative as was the attitude of all parties concerned, and free as,\r\nfrom beginning to end, the proceedings were from any startling\r\nincidents, no one can have watched them without being conscious of the\r\npresence of new forces of vast potentiality which must tend to modify\r\nvery profoundly the relations between the governors and the governed in\r\nIndia itself, and possibly even between India and the Mother Country.\r\nThey are the forces, largely still unknown, which have been brought into\r\nplay by Lord Morley's Constitutional reforms, and though they made\r\nthemselves naturally more conspicuously felt in the Imperial Council at\r\nCalcutta, they were present in every one of the enlarged Legislative\r\nCouncils of the Provincial Governments.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my purpose to recount in detail the long, though\r\ngenerally dispassionate, controversy to which these reforms gave rise.\r\nWe may not all be agreed as to the necessity or wisdom of some of the\r\nchanges embodied in them, and some may think that we are inclined to\r\ntravel too fast and too far on a road which Indians have not up to the\r\npresent shown themselves qualified to tread without danger. But there\r\nare few Englishmen either at home or in India who do not recognize the\r\nstatesmanlike spirit in which Lord Morley, loyally seconded throughout\r\nby Lord Minto, has approached the very difficult problem of giving to\r\nthe people of India a larger consultative voice in administration as\r\nwell as in legislation without jeopardizing the stability or impairing\r\nthe supremacy of British control. The future alone can show how far\r\nthese far-reaching changes will justify the generous expectations of\r\ntheir author, but taken as a whole they undoubtedly represent a\r\nconstructive work which is fully worthy of the fine record of British\r\nrule in India.\r\n\r\nHow very far-reaching they are the merest indication of their most\r\nsalient features will suffice to indicate. For the sake of convenience,\r\nthough they form a homogeneous whole, they may be divided roughly into\r\ntwo categories--those that affect the Executive Councils and those that\r\nhave remodelled the Legislative Councils. To the former category\r\nbelong:--\r\n\r\n(1) The appointment of an Indian member to the Viceroy's Executive\r\nCouncil. Mr. S.P. Sinha, a Bengalee barrister in large practice, was\r\nappointed to be legal member, and the ability and distinction with which\r\nhe discharged the duties of his high office have gone far to remove the\r\nmisgivings of many of those who were at first opposed to this new\r\ndeparture. It is the more to be regretted that his services will be lost\r\nto the new Viceroy, as he has announced his intention of retiring, for\r\npersonal reasons, at the end of Lord Minto's Viceroyalty[15].\r\n\r\n(2) The appointment of one Indian member to the Executive Councils of\r\nthe Governors of Madras and Bombay. The Rajah of Bobbili has been\r\nappointed in Madras and Mr. M.B. Chaubal in Bombay. An Indian will also\r\nbe appointed to the Executive Council of the Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nBengal as soon as that body has been finally constituted[16], and\r\nsimilar appointments will be made to the Executive Councils of the chief\r\nIndian provinces when the powers taken to create those bodies shall be\r\nput into operation.\r\n\r\n(3) The appointment of two Indians, one a Hindu and the other a\r\nMahomedan, to be members of the Council of the Secretary of State,\r\ngenerally known as the India Council, in Whitehall. Mr. K.G. Gupta and\r\nMr. Husain Bilgrami were appointed by Lord Morley in 1907. Mr. Bilgrami\r\nretired early in 1910 owing to ill-health and his place has been taken\r\nby Mr. M.A. Ali Baig.\r\n\r\nIn principle, the introduction of natives of India into these inner\r\nlines of the British Executive power undoubtedly constitutes, as Lord\r\nLansdowne has said, a \"tremendous innovation,\" but it may be doubted\r\nwhether in practice the consequences will be as considerable as those of\r\nthe changes effected by the India Councils Act of 1909 in the\r\ncomposition and attributions of the Imperial and Provincial Legislative\r\nCouncils. These changes are of a twofold character. In the first place\r\nthe total number of members has been very materially increased--e.g.,\r\nin the Imperial Legislative Council from 21 to a _maximum_ of 60; in the\r\nMadras and Bombay Legislative Councils from 24 to a _maximum_ of 50; in\r\nthe Bengal Legislative Council from 20 to 50, &c. Room has thus been\r\nmade for the introduction of a much larger number of elected members, of\r\nwhom there will be in future not less than 135 altogether in the\r\ndifferent Legislative Councils, as against only 39 under the old\r\nstatutes. Still more important than the mere increase in the number of\r\nelected members is the radical change in the proportion they will bear\r\nto official members. Except in the Imperial Council, where, at the\r\ninstance of Lord Morley, a small official majority has been retained\r\nwhich Lord Minto himself was willing to dispense with, there will no\r\nlonger be any official majority. The regulations determining the\r\nelectorates and the mode of election have been framed with praiseworthy\r\nelasticity in accordance with local requirements, and care has been\r\ntaken to provide as far as possible for an adequate representation of\r\nall the most important communities and interests. In view of the\r\nmanifold and profound lines of cleavage which exist in Indian society,\r\nit is extremely improbable that all the elected members will ever\r\ncombine against the official minority except in such rare and improbable\r\ncases as might produce an absolute consensus of Indian opinion, and in\r\nsuch cases it is even more improbable that Government would ignore so\r\nstriking a manifestation. Nevertheless, as a safeguard against the\r\npossibility of factious opposition, the right of veto has been reserved\r\nto the Provincial Executives and in the last resort to the\r\nGovernor-General in Council.\r\n\r\nThus the Indian Councils Act of 1909 cannot be said to have actually\r\nmodified the position of the Indian Legislatures. With regard to the\r\nmost important of them--viz., the Imperial Council--Lord Morley was\r\ncareful to make this perfectly clear in his despatch of November 27,\r\n1908, in which he reviewed the proposals put forward in the Government\r\nof India despatch of October 1. \"It is an essential condition of the\r\nreform policy,\" the Secretary of State wrote, \"that the Imperial\r\nsupremacy should in no degree be compromised. I must therefore regard it\r\nas essential that your Excellency's Council, in its legislative as well\r\nas in its executive character, should continue to be so constituted as\r\nto ensure its constant and uninterrupted power to fulfil the\r\nconstitutional obligation that it owes, and must always owe, to his\r\nMajesty's Government and to the Imperial Parliament.\" The Indian\r\nExecutive therefore remains, as hitherto, responsible only to the\r\nImperial Government at home, and the Imperial Council can exercise over\r\nit no directly controlling power. The same holds good, _mutatis\r\nmutandis_, of the Provincial Executives and their Councils.\r\n\r\nIndirectly, however, the Indian Councils Act of 1909 materially modifies\r\nthe relations between the Legislative Councils and the Executive by\r\ngiving to elected and non-official members opportunities which they have\r\nnever enjoyed before of discussing public policy and making their voices\r\nheard and their influence felt on both administrative and legislative\r\nmatters. The revised rules of procedure, under which supplementary\r\nquestions may be grafted on to interpellations, and resolutions can be\r\nmoved not only in connexion with the financial statements of Government,\r\nbut, with certain specified reservations, on most matters of general\r\npublic interest, are undoubtedly calculated to afford a vastly larger\r\nscope than in the past to the activities of Indian Legislatures, and it\r\nwill depend very much upon the ability and resourcefulness of members\r\nthemselves to what extent they may utilize these facilities for the\r\npurpose of ultimately creating real powers of control. In an extremely\r\ninteresting and dispassionate study of the Indian Constitution, and of\r\nthe effects which the new reforms may have upon it, Mr. Rangaswami\r\nIyengar, a Hindu journalist of Madras, comes to the conclusion that \"if\r\nthe powers now entrusted to the Councils are used with care, wisdom, and\r\ndiscrimination, precedents and procedure analogous to those of the House\r\nof Commons might gradually grow up, and might serve as a useful means if\r\nnot of directly controlling the Executive--a power which under the\r\npresent constitutional arrangement of the Government of India it is\r\nimpossible that the Council should possess--at least of directing the\r\nExecutive into correct and proper channels in regard to administrative\r\npolicy and administrative action.\" Not the least important of the\r\nchanges are those made in regard to Budget procedure. Indian\r\nLegislatures will no more than in the past have power to vote or to veto\r\nthe Budget, but they will have henceforth an opportunity of setting\r\nforth their views before the Budget has assumed its final shape. Members\r\nwill be able to discuss beforehand any changes in taxation, as well as\r\nany new loans or additional grants to local governments, and they will\r\nbe taken into the confidence of Government with regard to the\r\ndetermination of public expenditure. No doubt important heads of revenue\r\nare still excluded from the purview of the Councils, but members will\r\nhave the right of placing on record their views in the form of\r\nresolutions on all items not specifically excluded from their\r\ncognisance, and the Finance Member will be bound to explain the reasons\r\nwhy Government declines to accept any resolution that may have been\r\npassed in the first two stages of the Budget. Much will depend upon the\r\nreasonable and practical use which members make of these novel\r\nopportunities, for, to quote Mr. Iyengar again, \"the progress of\r\nconstitutional government is not dependent so much upon what is\r\nexpressly declared to be constitutional rights as upon what is silently\r\nbuilt up in the form of constitutional conventions.\"\r\n\r\nIn the great speech in which Lord Morley gave the House of Lords the\r\nfirst outline of his Indian reforms scheme there was one singularly\r\npregnant passage. \"We at any rate,\" he said, \"have no choice or option.\r\nAs an illustrious member of this House once said, we are watching a\r\ngreat and stupendous process, the reconstruction of a decomposed\r\nsociety. What we found was described as a parallel to Europe in the\r\nfifth century, and we have now, as it were, before us in that vast\r\ncongeries of people we call India, a long, slow march in uneven stages\r\nthrough all the centuries from the fifth to the twentieth. Stupendous\r\nindeed, and to guide that transition with sympathy, political wisdom,\r\nand courage, with a sense of humanity, duty, and national honour, may\r\nwell be called a glorious mission.\" Whether we succeed in that mission\r\nmust depend largely upon the loyal assistance we receive from those\r\nIndians who claim, in virtue of their superior education, to represent\r\nthis twentieth century. Lord Morley has fulfilled in no niggardly spirit\r\nhis pledge to associate the people of India with the Government far more\r\nclosely than has hitherto been the case in the work of actual day-to-day\r\nadministration as well as in the more complex problems of legislation.\r\nIt rests now with the Indian representatives both in the Executive and\r\nLegislative Councils to justify Lord Morley's expectations by using the\r\nnew machinery which he has placed in their hands not for purposes of\r\nmere destructive criticism and malevolent obstruction, but for\r\nintelligent and constructive co-operation with the British rulers of\r\nIndia, to whom alone, whatever may be their shortcomings, India owes it\r\nthat the spirit of the twentieth century has spread to her shores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPRESSED CASTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only classes in British India for whom no real representation has\r\nbeen devised in the enlarged Indian Councils are the millions of humble\r\ntoilers who constitute what are known as the \"depressed castes.\" Under\r\npresent social conditions in India, this was probably inevitable.\r\nThough, rather unreasonably, the vast majority of them go to swell the\r\nnumbers of the Hindu population in the census upon which Hindu\r\nrepresentation ought, according to Hindu politicians, to be based, those\r\npoliticians have certainly not as yet shown any title to speak on their\r\nbehalf. For there is no more striking contrast to the liberal and\r\ndemocratic professions of a body which claims, as does the Indian\r\nNational Congress, to represent an enlightened, progressive, and\r\nnational Hinduism than the fact that in the course of its 25 years'\r\nexistence it has scarcely done anything to give practical effect to its\r\ntheoretical repudiation of a social system that condemns some 50\r\nmillions out of the 300 millions of the Hindu population of India to a\r\nlife of unspeakable degradation. For a long time to come, the depressed\r\ncastes will probably find, as in the past, their truest friends and best\r\nqualified representatives among the European members of Council, who,\r\njust because they are aliens, are free from all the influences, whether\r\nof interest or of prejudice, which tend to divide Hindu society into so\r\nmany watertight compartments. Let any one who has any doubts on this\r\npoint read some of the documents published in the Blue-books on the\r\nreforms--petitions from low-caste communities imploring Government not\r\nto commit the defence of their interests to the Hindu Brahman, but to\r\ncontinue to them the direct and unselfish protection which they have\r\nhitherto enjoyed at the hands of British administrators.\r\n\r\nThe \"depressed classes\" of whom we generally speak as Pariahs, though\r\nthe name properly belongs only to one particular caste, the Pareiyas in\r\nSouthern India, include all Hindus who do not belong to the four highest\r\nor \"clean\" castes of Hinduism, and they are therefore now officially and\r\neuphemistically designated as the Panchamas--i.e., the fifth caste.\r\nMany of the Panchamas, especially in Southern India, are little better\r\nthan bonded serfs; others are condemned to this form of ostracism by the\r\ntrades they ply. Such are not only the scavengers and sweepers, but also\r\nthe workers in leather, the Chamars and Muchis of Northern and Central\r\nIndia, and the Chakilians and Madigas of Southern India, who with their\r\nfamilies number 14 or 15 million souls; the washermen, the\r\n_tadi_-drawers and vendors of spirituous liquors, the pressers of oil,\r\nand, in many parts of the country, the cowherd and shepherd castes, &c.\r\nThey are generally regarded as descendants of the aboriginal tribes\r\noverwhelmed centuries ago by the tide of Aryan conquest. Some of those\r\ntribes, grouped together in the Indian Census under the denominational\r\nrubric of \"Animists\" and numbering about 8-1/2 millions, have survived\r\nto the present day in remote hills and jungles without being absorbed\r\ninto the Hindu social system, and have preserved their primitive\r\nbeliefs, in which fetish worship, and magic are the dominant elements.\r\nLow as is their social _status_, it is but little lower than that of the\r\nPanchamas who have obtained a footing on the nethermost rung of the\r\nsocial ladder of Hinduism without being admitted to any sort of contact\r\nwith its higher civilization or even to the threshold of its temples.\r\n\r\nHinduism with all its rigidity is, it is true, sufficiently elastic to\r\nsanction, at least tacitly, a slow process of evolution by which the\r\nPanchama castes--for there are many castes even amongst the\r\n\"untouchables\"--gradually shake off to some extent the slough of\r\n\"uncleanness\" and establish some sort of ill-defined relations even with\r\nBrahmanism. For whilst there is on the one hand a slowly ascending scale\r\nby which the Panchamas may ultimately hope to smuggle themselves in\r\namongst the inferior Sudras, the lowest of the four \"clean\" castes, so\r\nthere is a descending scale by which Brahmans, under the pressure of\r\npoverty or disrepute, sink to so low a place in Brahmanism that they are\r\nwilling to lend their ministrations, at a price, to the more prosperous\r\nof the Panchamas and help them on their way to a higher _status_. Thus\r\nprobably half the Sudras of the present day were at some more or less\r\nremote period Panchamas. Again, during periods of great civil commotion,\r\nas in the 18th century, when brute force was supreme, not a few\r\nPanchamas, especially low-caste Mahrattas, made their way to the front\r\nas soldiers of fortune, and even carved out kingdoms to themselves at\r\nthe point of the sword. Orthodox Hinduism bowed in such cases to the\r\naccomplished fact, just as it has acquiesced in later years when\r\neducation and the equality of treatment brought by British rule have\r\nenabled a small number of Panchamas to qualify for employment under\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut these exceptions are so rare and the evolutionary process is so\r\ninfinitely slow and laborious that they do not visibly affect the\r\nyawning gulf between the \"clean\" higher-caste Hindu and the \"unclean\"\r\nPanchama. The latter may have learned to do _puja_ to Shiva or Kali or\r\nother members of the Hindu Pantheon, but he is not allowed within the\r\nprecincts of their sanctuaries and has to worship from afar. Nor are the\r\ndisabilities of the Panchama merely spiritual. In many villages he has\r\nto live entirely apart. He is not even allowed to draw water from the\r\nvillage well, lest he should \"pollute\" it by his touch, and where there\r\nis no second well for the \"untouchables,\" the hardship is cruel,\r\nespecially in seasons of drought when casual water dries up. In every\r\ncircumstance of his life the vileness of his lot is brought home to the\r\nwretched pariah by an elaborate and relentless system of social\r\noppression. I will only quote one or two instances which have come\r\nwithin my own observation. The respective distances beyond which\r\nPanchamas must not approach a Brahman lest they \"pollute\" him differ\r\naccording to their degree of uncleanness. Though they have been laid\r\ndown with great precision, it is growing more and more difficult to\r\nenforce them with the increasing promiscuity of railway and street-car\r\nintercourse, but in more remote parts of India, and especially in the\r\nsouth, the old rules are still often observed. In Cochin a few years ago\r\nI was crossing a bridge, and just in front of me walked a\r\nrespectable-looking native. He suddenly turned tail, and running back to\r\nthe end of the bridge from which we had both come, plunged out of sight\r\ninto the jungle on the side of the road. He had seen a Brahman entering\r\non to the bridge from the other end, and he had fled incontinently\r\nrather than incur the resentment of that high-caste gentleman by\r\ninflicting upon him the \"pollution\" of forbidden proximity as the\r\nbridge, though a fairly broad one, was not wide enough for them to pass\r\neach other at the prescribed distance. In the native State of Travancore\r\nit is not uncommon to see a Panchama witness in a lawsuit standing about\r\na hundred yards from the Court so as not to defile the Brahman Judge and\r\npleaders, whilst a row of _peons_, or messengers, stationed between him\r\nand the Court, hand on its questions to him and pass back his replies.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the abject ignorance and squalor and the repulsive habits of\r\nmany of these unfortunate castes help to explain and to perpetuate their\r\nostracism, but they do not exculpate a social system which prescribes\r\nor tolerates such a state of things. That if a kindly hand is extended\r\nto them, even the lowest of these depressed can be speedily raised to a\r\nhigher plane has been abundantly shown by the efforts of Christian\r\nmissionaries. They are only now beginning to extend their activities to\r\nthe depressed castes of Northern India, but in Southern India important\r\nresults have already been achieved. The Bishop of Madras claims that\r\nwithin the last 40 years, in the Telugu country alone, some 250,000\r\nPanchamas have become Christians, and in Travancore another 100,000.\r\nDuring the last two decades especially the philanthropic work done by\r\nthe missionaries in plague and famine time has borne a rich harvest, for\r\nthe Panchamas have naturally turned a ready ear to the spiritual\r\nministrations of those who stretched out their hands to help them in the\r\nhour of extreme need. Bishop Whitehead, who has devoted himself\r\nparticularly to this question, assures me that, in Southern India at\r\nleast, the rate at which the elevation of the depressed castes can be\r\nachieved depends mainly upon the amount of effort which the Christian\r\nmissions can put forth. If their organizations can be adequately\r\nstrengthened and extended so as to deal with the increasing numbers of\r\ninquirers and converts, and, above all, to train native teachers, he is\r\nconvinced that we may be within measurable distance of the reclamation\r\nof the whole Panchama population. What the effect would be from the\r\nsocial as well as the religious point of view may be gathered from a\r\nrecent report of the Telugu Mission, which most lay witnesses would, I\r\nbelieve readily confirm:--\r\n\r\n   If we look at the signs of moral and spiritual progress\r\n   during the last 40 years, the results of the mission work have\r\n   been most encouraging. It is quite true that naturally the\r\n   Panchamas are poor, dirty, ignorant, and, as a consequence\r\n   of many centuries of oppression, peculiarly addicted\r\n   to the more mean and servile vices. But the most hopeful\r\n   element in their case is that they are conscious of their\r\n   degradation and eager to escape from it. As a consequence,\r\n   when formed into congregations under the care of earnest\r\n   and capable teachers, they make marked progress materially,\r\n   intellectually, and morally. Their gross ignorance disappears;\r\n   they become cleaner and more decent in their persons\r\n   and homes; they give up cattle poisoning and grain stealing,\r\n   two crimes particularly associated with their class; they\r\n   abstain from the practice of infant marriage and concubinage,\r\n   to which almost all classes of Hindu society are addicted;\r\n   they lose much of the old servile spirit which led them to\r\n   grovel at the feet of their social superiors, and they acquire\r\n   more sense of the rights and dignity which belong to\r\n   them as men. Where they are able to escape their\r\n   surroundings they prove themselves in no way inferior,\r\n   either in mental or in moral character, to the best of their\r\n   fellow-countrymen. Especially is this the case in the Mission\r\n   Boarding Schools, where the change wrought is a moral\r\n   miracle. In many schools and colleges Christian lads of\r\n   Panchama origin are holding their own with, and in not a\r\n   few cases are actually outstripping, their Brahman competitors.\r\n    ... In one district the Hindus themselves\r\n   bore striking testimony to the effect of Christian teaching on\r\n   the pariahs, \"Before they became Christians,\" one of them\r\n   said, \"we had always to lock up our storehouses, and were\r\n   always having things stolen. But now all that is changed,\r\n   We can leave our houses open and never lose anything.\"\r\n\r\nIn the heyday of the Hindu Social Reform Movement, before it was checked\r\nby the inrush of political agitation, the question of the elevation of\r\nthe depressed castes was often and earnestly discussed by progressive\r\nHindus themselves, but it is only recently that it has again been taken\r\nup seriously by some of the Hindu leaders, and notably by Mr. Gokhale.\r\nOne of the utterances that has produced the greatest impression in Hindu\r\ncircles is a speech made last year by the Gaekwar of Baroda, a Hindu\r\nPrince who not only professes advanced Liberal views, but whose heart\r\nnaturally goes out to the depressed castes, as the fortunes of his own\r\nhouse were made in the turmoil of the eighteenth century by a Mahratta\r\nof humble extraction, if not actually of low-caste origin. His Highness\r\ndoes not attempt to minimize the evils of the system.\r\n\r\n   The same principles which impel us to ask for political\r\n   Justice for ourselves should actuate us to show social justice\r\n   to each other.... By the sincerity of our efforts to\r\n   uplift the depressed classes we shall be judged fit to achieve\r\n   the objects of our national desire.... The system which\r\n   divides us into innumerable castes claiming to rise by\r\n   minutely graduated steps from the pariah to the Brahman\r\n   is a whole tissue of injustice, splitting men equal by nature\r\n   into divisions high and low, based not on the natural standard\r\n   of personal qualities but on accidents of birth. The eternal\r\n   struggle between caste and caste for social superiority has\r\n   become a constant source of ill-feeling.... Want of\r\n   education is practically universal amongst the depressed\r\n   classes, but this cannot have been the cause of their fall, for\r\n   many of the so-called higher classes in India share in the\r\n   general ignorance. Unlike them, however, they are unable\r\n   to attend the ordinary schools owing to the idea that it is\r\n   pollution to touch them. To do so is to commit a sin offensive\r\n   alike to religion and to conventional morality. Of\r\n   professions as a means of livelihood these depressed classes\r\n   have a very small choice. Here, too, the supposed pollution\r\n   of their touch comes in their way. On every hand we find\r\n   that the peculiar difficulty from which they suffer, in addition to\r\n   others that they share with other classes, is their \"untouchableness.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a powerful argument against the theory of \"untouchableness\" and\r\nagainst priestly intolerance, the Gaekwar urges not only upon Hindus,\r\nbut upon Government the duty of attacking in all earnestness this\r\nformidable problem.\r\n\r\n   A Government within easy reach of the latest thought,\r\n   with unlimited moral and material resources, such as there\r\n   is in India, should not remain content with simply asserting\r\n   the equality of men under the common law and maintaining\r\n   order, but must sympathetically see from time to time that\r\n   the different sections of its subjects are provided with ample\r\n   means of progress. Many of the Indian States where they\r\n   are at all alive to the true functions of government, owing\r\n   to less elevating surroundings or out of nervousness, fear to\r\n   strike out a new path and find it less troublesome to follow\r\n   the policy of _laisser faire_ and to walk in the footsteps of the\r\n   highest Government in India, whose declared policy is to let\r\n   the social and religious matters of the people alone except\r\n   where questions of grave importance are involved. When\r\n   one-sixth of the people are in a chronically depressed and\r\n   ignorant condition, no Government can afford to ignore\r\n   the urgent necessity of doing what it can for their elevation.\r\n\r\nCan the Government of India afford to disregard so remarkable an appeal?\r\nThe question is not merely a social and moral question, but also a\r\npolitical one. Whilst some high-caste Hindus are beginning to recognize\r\nits urgency, the more prosperous of the socially depressed castes\r\nthemselves are showing signs of restlessness under the ostracism to\r\nwhich they are subjected. From almost all of these castes a few\r\nindividuals have always emerged, who acquired wealth and the relative\r\nrecognition that wealth brings with it, and the numbers of such\r\nindividuals are increasing. In some cases a whole caste has seen its\r\ncircumstances improve under new economic conditions entirety beyond its\r\nown control--like the Namasudras of Bengal, who, as agriculturists, have\r\nhad their share of the growing agricultural prosperity of that region.\r\nThey are materially better off than they used to be, and so they are no\r\nlonger content with their old social _status_ of inferiority. Not only\r\nChristian but Mahomedan missionaries have been at work amongst them, and\r\nthough the vast majority remain Hindus, they note, like the Panchamas\r\nall over India must note, the immediate rise in the social scale of\r\ntheir fellow-caste-men who embrace either Christianity or Islam. For it\r\nis one of the anomalies of this peculiar conception that the most\r\nuntouchable Hindu ceases to be quite as untouchable when he becomes a\r\nChristian or a Mahomedan. The Bengalee politician was quick to see the\r\ndanger of losing hold altogether of the Namasudras, and he set up a\r\npropaganda of his own, which I have already described, with the object\r\nof winning them over to his side and to his methods of agitation by\r\npromising them in return a relaxation of caste stringency. The question\r\nwith which we are confronted is whether we shall ourselves take a hand\r\nin the elevation of the depressed castes or whether we shall leave it to\r\nothers, many of whom would exploit them for their own purposes. Is not\r\nthis an opportunity for the Government of India to respond to the\r\nGaekwar's invitation and depart for once from their traditional policy\r\nof _laisser faire_? In the Christian Missions they have an admirable\r\norganization ready to hand which merely requires encouragement and\r\nsupport. Though there are manifold dangers in giving official\r\ncountenance to proselytizing work amongst the higher classes of Indian\r\nsociety, none of those objections can reasonably lie to co-operating in\r\nthe reclamation of whole classes which the orthodox Hindu regards as\r\nbeyond the pale of human intercourse. From the religious point of view,\r\nthis is a matter which should engage the earnest attention of the great\r\nmissionary societies of this country. The hour seems to be at hand when\r\na great and combined effort is required of them. From the moral and\r\nsocial point of view they may well claim in this connexion the sympathy\r\nand support of all denominations and no-denominations that are\r\ninterested in the welfare and progress of backward races. From the\r\npolitical point of view the conversion of so many millions of the\r\npopulation of India to the faith of their rulers would open up prospects\r\nof such moment that I need not expatiate upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVE STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the chief features of the original scheme of constitutional\r\nreforms submitted to the Secretary of State by the Government of India\r\nwas the creation of an Imperial Advisory Council composed of ruling\r\nchiefs and territorial magnates. The proposal gave rise to a variety of\r\nobjections, the most serious one being the difficulty of adjusting the\r\nrelations to the Government of India of a Council in which the most\r\nconspicuous members could have had no definite _locus standi_ in regard\r\nto the internal affairs of British India--i.e., of the larger part of\r\nour Indian dependency under direct British administration. The\r\ndifficulty was evaded by dropping the proposal. But to evade a\r\ndifficulty is only to postpone it. Though the constitutional reforms are\r\nconfined, in their immediate application, to British India, measures of\r\nsuch far-reaching importance must react more or less directly upon the\r\nwhole of our Indian Empire. Is it therefore politic, or, indeed,\r\npossible, to leave out of account the Native States, which occupy\r\naltogether about one-third of the total area of India and have an\r\naggregate population of over 68 millions, or to ignore the rulers\r\ncharged with their administration?\r\n\r\nThe Native States of India vary in size and importance from powerful\r\nprincipalities like the Nizam's State of Hyderabad, with an area of\r\n82,000 miles--nearly equal to that of England and Wales and Scotland---\r\nand a population of over 11 millions, down to diminutive chiefships,\r\nsmaller than the holdings of a great English landlord. Distributed\r\nthroughout the whole length and breadth of the peninsula, they display\r\nthe same extraordinary variety of races and creeds and castes and\r\nlanguages and customs and traditions as the provinces under the\r\nimmediate governance of the Viceroy, and their rulers themselves\r\nrepresent almost every phase and aspect of Indian history. The Princes\r\nof Rajputana, headed by the Maharana of Udaipur, with genealogies\r\nreaching back into the mythical ages, have handed down to the present\r\nday the traditions of Hindu chivalry. In the south of India, the rulers\r\nof Mysore and Cochin and Iravancore, who also claim Rajput blood, still\r\npersonify the subjection of the older Dravidian races to the Aryan\r\ninvaders from the north. Mahratta chiefs like Scindia and the Gaekwar\r\ndate from the great uplifting of the Mahratta power in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, whilst the Maharajah of Kolhapur is a descendant of Shivaji,\r\nthe first Mahratta chieftain to stem the tide of Mahomedan conquest more\r\nthan a century earlier. The great majority of the ruling princes and\r\nchiefs are Hindus, but besides the Nizam, the most powerful of all,\r\nthere are not a few Mahomedan rulers who have survived the downfall of\r\nMoslem supremacy, just as the Sikh chiefs of Patiala, Nabha, and\r\nKapurthala, in the Punjab, still recall the great days of Ranjit Singh\r\nand the Sikh confederacy. In some of the Native States the ruling\r\nfamilies are neither of the same race nor of the same creed as the\r\nmajority of their subjects. The Nizam is a Sunni Mahomedan, but most of\r\nhis subjects are Hindus, and of the Mahomedans some of the most\r\ninfluential are Shias. The Maharajah of Kashmir, a Hindu Rajput, rules\r\nover many Mongolian Buddhists, whilst there are but few Mahrattas in\r\nGwalior or Indore, though both Holkar and Scindia are, Mahratta\r\nPrinces.\r\n\r\nIn all the Native States the system of government is more or less of the\r\nold patriarchal or personal type which has always obtained in the East,\r\nbut in its application it exhibits many variations which reflect\r\nsometimes the idiosyncrasies of the ruler and sometimes the dominant\r\nforces of inherited social traditions. In Cochin and Travancore, for\r\ninstance, the ancient ascendency of the Northern Brahmans over the\r\nDravidian subject races survives in some of its most archaic forms.\r\nUdaipur and Jaipur have perhaps preserved more than any other States of\r\nRajputana the aristocratic conservatism of olden days, whilst some of\r\nthe younger Rajput chiefs have moved more freely with the times and with\r\ntheir own Western education. The Gaekwar has gone further than any other\r\nruling chief in introducing into his State of Baroda the outward forms\r\nof what we call Western progress, though his will is probably in all\r\nessentials as absolute as that of Scindia, another Mahratta chief, whose\r\ninterest in every form of Western activity is displayed almost as much\r\nin his physical energy as in his intellectual alertness. Some no doubt\r\nabandon the conduct of public affairs almost entirely to their Ministers\r\nand prefer a life of easy self-indulgence. Others, on the contrary, are\r\nkeen administrators, and insist upon doing everything themselves. As\r\nmasterful a ruler as any in the whole of India is a lady, the Begum of\r\nBhopal, a Mahomedan Princess of rare attainments and character. The\r\nNizam, on the other hand, though an absolute ruler, has recently placed\r\nit on record that he attributes the peaceful content and law-abiding\r\ncharacter of his subjections to the liberal traditions he has inherited\r\nfrom his ancestors. \"They were singularly free from all religious and\r\nracial prejudices. Their wisdom and foresight induced them to employ\r\nHindus and Mahomedans, Europeans, and Parsees alike, in carrying on the\r\nadministration, and they reposed entire confidence in their officers\r\nwhatever religion and race they belonged to.\" To those principles his\r\nHighness rightly claims to have himself adhered.\r\n\r\nAgain, though the relationship of the Supreme Government to all these\r\nrulers is one of suzerainty, it is governed in each particular case by\r\nspecial and different treaties which vary the extent and nature of the\r\ncontrol exercised over them. In some of its aspects, the principles of\r\nour policy towards them were admirably set forth in a speech delivered\r\nin November, 1909, by Lord Minto at Udaipur. \"In guaranteeing their\r\ninternal independence and in undertaking their protection against\r\nexternal aggression, it naturally follows that the Imperial Government\r\nhas assumed a certain degree of responsibility for the general soundness\r\nof their administration, and would not consent to incur the reproach of\r\nbeing an indirect instrument of misrule. There are also certain matters\r\nin which it is necessary for the Government of India to safeguard the\r\ninterests of the community as a whole, as well as those of the Paramount\r\nPower, such as railways, telegraphs, and other services of an Imperial\r\ncharacter.\" At the same time the Viceroy wisely laid great stress on the\r\nfact that, in pursuance of the pledges given by the British Crown to the\r\nrulers of the Native States, \"our policy is with rare exceptions one of\r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs,\" and he pointed out that, as\r\nowing to the varying conditions of different States \"any attempt at\r\ncomplete uniformity and subservience to precedent\" must be dangerous, he\r\nhad endeavoured \"to deal with questions as they arose with reference to\r\nexisting treaties, the merits of each case, local conditions, antecedent\r\ncircumstances, and the particular stage of development, feudal and\r\nconstitutional, of individual principalities.\" It is obviously\r\nimpossible to enforce a more rigid control over the feudatory States at\r\nthe same time as we are delegating larger powers to the natives of India\r\nunder direct British administration. This is a point which Lord Minto\r\nmight indeed have emphasized with advantage. For there seems to be a\r\ngrowing tendency, probably at home rather than in India, to ignore our\r\nresponsibilities towards the ruling chiefs, and to regard them as more\r\nor less negligible quantities in the constitutional experiments we are\r\nmaking in our Indian Empire. When an emergency arises such as a frontier\r\nwar or a military expedition in the Sudan or in China, we appeal\r\nunhesitatingly to the loyalty of the Princes of India, and so far they\r\nhave cheerfully borne their share in these Imperial enterprises though\r\nthey were never drawn into consultation beforehand, and their own\r\nmaterial interests were not directly involved. On the other hand,\r\nquestions which do involve their material interests, questions which\r\nnecessarily affect the well-being of their States quite as much as that\r\nof British India, questions of tariff and of currency that react upon\r\nthe economic prosperity of the whole of India are settled between\r\nWhitehall and Government House at Calcutta without their opinion being\r\neven invited. Sometimes even decisions are taken without their knowledge\r\non matters that directly affect their own exchequers, as in the matter\r\nof the opium trade with China. Some of the native States are the largest\r\nproducers of the Indian poppy, and in order to satisfy the\r\nsusceptibilities, very meritorious in themselves, of our national\r\nconscience, we lightheartedly impose upon them, without consultation or\r\nprospect of compensation, the sacrifice, which costs us nothing, of one\r\nof the most valuable products of their soil and chief sources of\r\nrevenue. Can they do otherwise than draw unfavourable comparisons\r\nbetween the harsh measure meted out to them in this matter and the\r\ngenerous treatment of the West Indies by the Mother Country when\r\n£20,000,000 were voted out of the Imperial Exchequer towards\r\ncompensation for the material losses arising out of the abolition of\r\nslavery?\r\n\r\nHow important it is to associate the Princes of India with the purposes\r\nof our Indian policy has seldom been more clearly shown than during\r\nthese last troublous years when the forces of disaffection have revealed\r\nthemselves as a serious public danger. The principle of authority\r\ncannot be attacked in British India without suffering diminution in the\r\nNative States. They are not shut up in watertight compartments and\r\nsedition cannot be preached on one side of a border, which in most cases\r\nis merely an administrative boundary line, without finding an echo on\r\nthe other side. The prestige of an Indian Prince in his own land is\r\ngreat. It is rooted in most cases in ancient traditions to which no\r\nalien rulers can appeal. Nevertheless some of the most experienced and\r\nenlightened of the ruling chiefs showed a much earlier and livelier\r\nappreciation of the subversive tendencies of Indian unrest than those\r\nresponsible for the governance of British India. Some of them, like the\r\nMaharajahs of Kolhapur and of Patiala, have been brought face to face\r\nwith the same violent, and even with the same criminal, methods of\r\nagitation as the Government of India has had to deal with in provinces\r\nunder British administration. The Maharajah of Jaipur and Maharajah\r\nScindia felt themselves constrained just about a year ago to enact\r\nvigorous measures on their own account against sedition and against the\r\nimportation into their States of seditious literature which was still\r\nallowed to circulate with impunity in British India, whilst the State of\r\nBikanir was the first to introduce an Explosive Substances Act\r\nimmediately after the epidemic of bomb-throwing had broken out in\r\nBengal. Other States have also taken strong preventive measures, but\r\nmany have fortunately been spared so far any serious trouble within\r\ntheir own borders, and their rulers have been able to study the problem\r\nmerely as interested observers and from the point of view of the general\r\nwelfare of the country.\r\n\r\nOn August 65 1909, the Viceroy took the unusual step of communicating\r\ndirect with all the principal ruling Princes and Chiefs of India on the\r\nsubject of the Active unrest prevalent in many parts of the country, and\r\ninvited an exchange of opinions \"with a view to mutual co-operation\r\nagainst a common danger.\" Some doubts were then expressed as to the\r\nwisdom of such a course, on the ground that it might create in the\r\nprotected States an impression of exaggerated alarm. 'But the tone and\r\nsubstance of the replies which his Excellency's communication elicited\r\nshowed that there was no reason for any such apprehensions. The Ruling\r\nChiefs, on the contrary, appreciated and reciprocated the confidence\r\nreposed in them, and their replies, indeed, constitute an exceptionally\r\ninteresting and instructive set of documents; for the very diversity of\r\norigin and traditions and influence gives peculiar weight to the\r\nposition assumed by the rulers of the Native States towards the forces\r\nof active unrest in India. Had those forces merely been engaged in a\r\nlegitimate struggle for the enlargement of Indian rights and liberties,\r\nit is scarcely conceivable that the Ruling Princes and Chiefs should\r\nhave passed judgment against them with such overwhelming unanimity.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that in replying to a Viceregal _Kharita_, the Ruling\r\nChiefs could hardly do less than recognize the existence of the \"common\r\ndanger\" to which Lord Minto had drawn their attention. But the careful\r\nanalysis of the influences behind the agitation and the practical\r\nsuggestions for dealing with it which the majority of the replies\r\ncontain, prove that their opinions are certainly not framed \"to order.\"\r\nThey represent the convictions and experience of a group of responsible\r\nIndians better situated in some respects to obtain accurate information\r\nabout the doings and feelings of their fellow-countrymen than any\r\nAnglo-Indian administrators can be. The language of the Nizam is\r\nsingularly apt and direct, \"Once the forces of lawlessness and disorder\r\nare let loose there is no knowing where they will stop. It is true that,\r\ncompared with the enormous population of India, the disaffected people\r\nare a very insignificant minority, but, given time and opportunity,\r\nthere exists the danger of this small minority spreading its tentacles\r\nall over the country and inoculating with its poisonous doctrines the\r\nclasses and masses hitherto untouched by this seditious movement.\" The\r\nMaharana of Udaipur, speaking with the authority of his unique position\r\namongst Hindus as the premier Prince of Rajputana, not only condemns an\r\nagitation \"which is detrimental to all good government and social\r\nadministration,\" but declares it to be \"a great disgrace to their name\r\nas also to their religious beliefs that, in spite of the great\r\nprosperity India has enjoyed under the British _régime_, people are\r\nacting in such an ungrateful way.\" No less emphatic is the Mahratta\r\nruler of Gwalior:--\"The question is undoubtedly a grave one, affecting\r\nas it does the future well-being of India,\" and \"it particularly behoves\r\nthose who preside over the destinies of the people and have large\r\npersonal stakes to do all in their power to grapple with it vigorously.\"\r\nThe Maharajah of Jaipur, one of the wisest of the older generation of\r\nHindu rulers, agrees that \"only a small fraction of the population has\r\nbeen contaminated by the seditious germ,\" but he adds significantly that\r\n\"that fraction has, it seems, been carefully organized by able, rich,\r\nand unscrupulous men,\" and he does not hesitate to declare that \"an\r\norganized and concerted campaign, offensive and defensive, against the\r\ncommon enemy is what is wanted.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the Rajah of Dewas, one of the most enlightened of the\r\nyounger Hindu chiefs, \"it is a well known fact that the endeavours of\r\nthe seditious party are directed not only against the Paramount Power,\r\nbut against all constituted forms of government in India, through an\r\nabsolutely misunderstood sense of 'patriotism,' and through an\r\nattachment to the popular idea of 'government by the people,' when every\r\nlevel-headed Indian must admit that India generally has not in any way\r\nshown its fitness for a popular government.\" He goes so far even as to\r\nstate his personal conviction that history and all \"sound-minded\" people\r\nagree that India cannot really attain to the standard of popular\r\ngovernment as understood by the West.\r\n\r\nIt is another Hindu ruler, the Rajah of Ratlam, who points out the close\r\nconnexion, upon which I have had to lay repeated stress, between\r\nreligious revivalism and sedition. He recognizes that \"Hindus, and for\r\nthe matter of that all Oriental peoples, are swayed more by religion\r\nthan by anything else.\" Government have hitherto adopted, and rightly\r\nadopted, the policy of allowing perfect freedom in the matter of\r\nreligious beliefs, but as the seditionists are seeking to connect their\r\nanarchical movement with religion, and the political _Sadhu_ is abroad,\r\nit is high time to change the policy of non-interference in so-called\r\nreligious affairs. The new religion which is now being preached, \"with\r\nits worship of heroes like Shivaji and the doctrine of India for India\r\nalone,\" deserves, this Hindu Prince boldly declares, to be treated as\r\nThuggism and Suttee were treated, which both claimed the sanction of\r\nreligion. \"It pains me,\" he adds, \"to write as above, but already\r\nreligion has played a prominent part in this matter, and religious books\r\nwere found in almost every search made for weapons and bombs. The _rôle_\r\nof the priest or the _Sadhu_ is most convenient, and rulers have bowed,\r\nand do bow, to religious preachers. These people generally distort the\r\nreal import of religious precepts, and thereby vitiate the public mind.\r\nThe founders are sly enough to flatter the Government by an occasional\r\naddress breathing loyalty and friendship, but it is essential to check\r\nthis religious propaganda.\"\r\n\r\nThe rulers of the Native States are not content merely to profess\r\nloyalty and reprobate disaffection. With the exception of the Gaekwar,\r\nwhose reply, without striking any note of substantial dissent, is,\r\nmarked, by a certain coolness that has won for him the applause of the\r\nNationalist Press, they respond heartily to the Viceroy's request for\r\nsuggestions as to the most effective measures to cope with the evil.\r\nMost of them put in the very forefront of their recommendations the\r\nnecessity of checking the licence of the Indian Press, to which they\r\nattribute the main responsibility for the widening of the gulf between\r\nthe rulers and the ruled. And it should be remembered that these\r\nopinions were expressed some months before the Imperial Government and\r\nthe Government of India decided to introduce the new Press Act. The\r\nNizam holds that newspapers publishing false allegations or exaggerated\r\nreports should be officially called upon \"to print formal contradiction\r\nor correction as directed.\" For, in his Highness's opinion, \"it is no\r\nlonger safe or desirable to treat with silent contempt any perverse\r\nstatement which is publicly made, because the spread of education on the\r\none hand has created a general interest in the news of the country, and\r\na section of the Press, on the other hand, deliberately disseminates\r\nnews calculated to promote enmity between Europeans and Indians, or to\r\nexcite hatred of Government and its officers in the ignorant and\r\ncredulous minds.\" Several Chiefs recommend more summary proceedings and\r\nless publicity in the case of political offences, as, though such\r\nmeasures may appear arbitrary at first sight, \"they are quite suited to\r\nthe country.\" Several agree that a closer watch should be kept on\r\n\"religious mendicants\" who go about in the guise of _Sadhus_ preaching\r\nsedition, and that a more intimate exchange of secret intelligence\r\nshould take place with regard to the seditious propaganda between the\r\ndifferent States and the Government of India. Others believe in the\r\ncreation of counter-organizations to inform and encourage the loyal\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nBut it is perhaps on the question of education that some of the Ruling\r\nChiefs speak with the greatest weight and authority, and there is\r\nnothing they more deeply deplore than the divorce of secular instruction\r\nfrom religious and moral training, which they hold responsible for much\r\nof the present mischief. \"Strange as it may sound,\" says the Rajah of\r\nDewas, \"it is a well-known fact that the germs of the present unrest in\r\nIndia were laid by that benefactor of the human race, education.\"\r\nAnother Chief is of opinion that, as the formation of character is the\r\nhighest object of education, all public schools should be graded by the\r\nresults they achieve in this direction rather than by high percentages\r\nin examinations; whilst others strongly recommend the extension of the\r\nresidential college system and greater care in the selection of good\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nOne may possibly not agree with all the opinions expressed or with all\r\nthe recommendations made in this correspondence, but their general\r\nuniformity cannot fail to carry weight. It certainly carried weight with\r\nboth the Government of India and the Imperial Government. Not only did\r\nit admittedly contribute to the enactment of the Indian Press Bill of\r\nFebruary last, but it has probably also contributed to bring about a\r\nmore general recognition of the urgency of the Indian educational\r\nproblem. The effect produced in India itself by the publication of the\r\nviews held by the rulers of Native States, many of whom enjoy great\r\nprestige and influence far beyond the limits of their immediate\r\ndominions, was naturally considerable. The \"extremists\" were lashed to\r\nfury, and none of the seditious leaflets directed against the \"alien\"\r\nrulers and \"sun-dried bureaucrats\" was more violent than one issued in\r\nreply to these utterances of the rulers of their own race. One of the\r\nruling Chiefs to whom it had been sent gave me a copy of it as \"a\r\ncharacteristic document.\" It is headed: \"Choose, O Indian Princes.\" It\r\nbegins, it is true, by assuring them that there is not as yet any\r\ncut-and-dried scheme for dealing with them.\r\n\r\n   No one but the voice of the Mother herself will and can\r\n   determine when once She comes to herself and stands free\r\n   what constitution shall be adopted by Her for the guidance\r\n   of Her life after the revolution is over. ... Without\r\n   going into details we may mention this much, that whether\r\n   the head of the Imperial Government of the Indian Nation\r\n   be a President or a King depends upon how the revolution\r\n   develops itself ... The Mother must be free, must\r\n   be one and united, must make her will supreme. Then it\r\n   may be that She gives out this Her will either wearing a kingly\r\n   crown on Her head or a Republican mantle round Her sacred\r\n   form.\r\n\r\nBut after being exhorted in impassioned accents either to sacrifice\r\nthemselves in the great national struggle now at hand, or at the very\r\nleast to stand back and keep the ring, they are warned as to the\r\nconsequences of disregarding these admonitions:--\r\n\r\n   Forget not, O Princes! that a strict account will be asked\r\n   of your doings and non-doings, and a people newly-born\r\n   will not fail to pay you in the coin you paid. Every one\r\n   who shall have actively betrayed the trust of the people,\r\n   disowned his fathers, and debased his blood by arraying\r\n   himself against the Mother--he shall be crushed to dust\r\n   and ashes.... Do you doubt our grim earnestness!\r\n   If so hear the name of Dhingra and be dumb. In the name\r\n   of that martyr, O Indian Princes, we ask you to think\r\n   solemnly and deeply upon these words. Choose as you will\r\n   and you will reap what you sow. Choose whether you shall\r\n   be the first of the nation's fathers or the last of the nation's\r\n   tyrants.\r\n\r\nIn some less rabid quarters an attempt has been made to decry the views\r\nof the native rulers as emanating from petty Oriental despots, terrified\r\nby the onward march of the new Indian democracy. If so it is strange\r\nthat whilst these \"despots\" make no secret of their attitude towards\r\ndisaffection, they are equally outspoken on the necessity of a liberal\r\nand progressive policy. The Nizam himself states emphatically that he is\r\n\"a great believer in conciliation and repression going hand in hand to\r\ncope with the present condition of India. While sedition should be\r\nlocalized and rooted out sternly, and even mercilessly, deep sympathy\r\nand unreserved reliance should manifest themselves in all dealings with\r\nloyal subjects without distinction of creed, caste, and colour.\"\r\nUnfortunately it requires at the present day more courage for an Indian\r\nto hold such language as that than to coquet, as many politicians do,\r\nwith violence and crime. Indians in high position are peculiarly\r\nsensitive to printed attacks, perhaps because behind such attacks there\r\noften lurk forms of social pressure, rendered possible by their caste\r\nsystem, with which we, happily for ourselves, are totally unfamiliar.\r\nOne of the most discouraging features of the present situation is that\r\nso few among the \"moderate\" politicians who are known to share and\r\napprove the views expressed by the Princes of India have had the moral\r\ncourage to endorse them publicly.\r\n\r\nThe fearless response made by the ruling Chiefs to Lord Minto's appeal\r\nfor advice and support in the repression of sedition conveys at the same\r\ntime another lesson which we may well take to heart. The Government of\r\nIndia consulted them after the danger had arisen and become manifest. Is\r\nit not possible that, had we maintained closer touch with them in the\r\npast, had we appreciated more fully the value of their knowledge and\r\nexperience, the danger might never have arisen or would never have\r\nattained such threatening proportions? At any rate, now that the\r\nconsciousness of a common danger has drawn Princes and Government closer\r\ntogether, no time should be lost in establishing some machinery which\r\nwould secure for the future a more sustained and intimate co-operation\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCROSS CURRENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political aspects of Indian unrest have compelled me to dwell\r\nchiefly upon the evil forces which it has generated. But contact with\r\nthe West has acted as a powerful ferment for good as well as for evil\r\nupon every class of Indian society that has come more or less directly\r\nunder its influence. Were it otherwise we should indeed have to admit\r\nthe moral bankruptcy of our civilization. The forces of unrest are made\r\nup of many heterogeneous and often conflicting elements, and even in\r\ntheir most mischievous manifestations there are sometimes germs of good\r\nwhich it should be our business to preserve and to develop. Largely as\r\nthe classes touched, however superficially, by Western education have of\r\nlate years been invaded by a spirit of reaction and of revolt against\r\nall for which that education stands, they have not yet by any means been\r\nwholly conquered by it. It is the breath of the West that has stirred\r\nthe spiritual and intellectual activity of which Hindu revivalism and\r\npolitical disaffection, glorified under the name of Nationalism, are\r\nunfortunately the most prominent and the most recent but not the only\r\noutcome. Another and much healthier outcome is the sense of social duty\r\nand social service which has grown up amongst many educated Indians of\r\nall races and creeds, and amongst none more markedly than amongst the\r\nHindus. Traditions of mutual helpfulness are indeed deep-rooted in\r\nIndia as in all Oriental communities. Mutual helpfulness is the best\r\nfeature of the caste system, of the Hindu family system, of the old\r\nIndian village system, and it explains the absence in a country where\r\nthere is so much poverty of those abject forms of pauperism with which\r\nwe are compelled at home to deal through the painful medium of our Poor\r\nLaws. But until the leaven of Western ideas had been imported into India\r\nmutual helpfulness was generally confined within the narrow limits of\r\ndistinct and separate social units. It is now slowly expanding out of\r\nwatertight compartments into a more spacious conception of the social\r\ninter-dependence of the different classes of the community. This\r\nexpansion of the Indian's social horizon began with the social reform\r\nmovement which had kindled the enthusiasm, of an older generation in the\r\n'70's and '80's of the last century. Far from being, as some contend, a\r\nby-product of the more recent Nationalism, which had never been heard of\r\nat that period, its progress, as I have already shown, has been hampered\r\nnot only by the reactionary tendencies of this Nationalism in religious\r\nand social matters, but by the diversion of some of the best energies of\r\nthe country into the relatively barren field of political agitation.\r\n\r\nThough social reform has been checked, it has not been altogether\r\narrested, nor can it be arrested so long as British rule, by the mere\r\nfact of its existence, maintains the ascendency of Western ideals.\r\nHappily there are still plenty of educated Indians who realize that the\r\nliberation of Indian society from the trammels which are of its own\r\nmaking is much more urgent than its enfranchisement from an alien yoke.\r\nEven amongst politicians of almost every complexion the necessity of\r\nremoving from the Indian social system the reproach of degrading\r\nanachronisms is finding at least theoretical recognition. Alongside of\r\nmore conspicuous political organizations devoted mainly to political\r\npropaganda, other organizations have been quietly developing all over\r\nIndia whose chief purpose it is to grapple with social, religious, and\r\neconomic problems which are not, or need not necessarily be, in any way\r\nconnected with politics. Their voices are too often drowned by the\r\nlouder clamour of the politicians pure and simple, and they attract\r\nlittle attention outside India. But no one who has spent any time in\r\nIndia can fail to be struck with the many-sided activities revealed in\r\nall the non-political conventions and conferences and congresses held\r\nannually all over the country. Within the last 12 months there have been\r\nphilanthropic and religious conferences like the All India Temperance\r\nConference, the Christian Endeavour Convention, the Theosophical\r\nConvention, social conferences like the Indian National Social\r\nConference, the Moslem Educational Congress, and the Sikh Educational\r\nConference, economic conferences like the Industrial Conference held at\r\nLahore in connexion with the Punjab Industrial and Agricultural\r\nExhibition, not to speak of many others, such as the Rajput Conference,\r\nthe Hindu Punjab Conference, the Kshatrya Conference, the Parsee\r\nConference, &c., which dealt with the narrower interests of particular\r\ncastes or communities, but nevertheless gathered together\r\nrepresentatives of those interests from all parts of India, or any rate\r\nfrom a whole province. Some of these meetings may be made to subserve\r\npolitical purposes. Others, like the Parsee Conference, betray\r\nreactionary tendencies in the most unexpected places, for the Parsee\r\ncommunity, which has thriven more than any other on Western education\r\nand has prided itself upon being the most progressive and enlightened of\r\nall Indian communities, is the last one in which one would have looked\r\nfor the triumph, however temporary, of a strangely benighted orthodoxy.\r\nBut the majority of these gatherings represent an honest and earnest\r\nattempt to apply, as far as possible, the teachings of Western\r\nexperience to the solution of Indian problems, and to subject Indian\r\ncustoms and beliefs to the test of modern criticism. They apply\r\nthemselves, moreover, chiefly to questions in which no alien Government\r\nlike that of India can take the initiative without serious risk of being\r\naltogether ahead of native opinion and arousing dangerous antagonism. As\r\nMr. Lala Dev Raj, the chairman of the last Social Conference at Lahore,\r\nfor instance, put it:--\r\n\r\n   The reforms advocated here strike at those harmful and\r\n   undesirable customs which are purely of our own creation and\r\n   which must be bidden farewell to, as our eyes are being opened\r\n   to them. If we cannot do that, we can hardly call ourselves\r\n   a living community.\r\n\r\nThe results of all this activity may not so far have been very marked,\r\nbut the mere fact that the supreme sanction of tradition, which was\r\nformerly almost undisputed, is now subjected to discussion is bound to\r\nmake some impression, even upon those whose political concepts are\r\nbased, upon the immanent superiority of Hinduism. The new interpretation\r\nof the _Baghvat Gita_, though sometimes distorted to hideous ends, has\r\nitself been inspired by a broader appreciation of social duty than there\r\nwas room for in the Hindu theory of life before it had been modified by\r\nWestern influences. So long as the spirit of social endeavour kindled by\r\nmen like Ram Mohun Roy and Keshab Chunder Sen and Mahadev Govind Ranade\r\nis kept alive, even though by much lesser men, we may well hope that the\r\npresent wave of revolt will ultimately spend itself on the dead shore of\r\na factious and artificial reaction, incompatible with the purpose to\r\nwhich their own best efforts were devoted, of bringing the social life\r\nof India into harmony with Western civilization.\r\n\r\nA phenomenon, which may prove to have a deep significance is that, side\r\nby side with these larger organisations for the promotion of social\r\nreform which only claim incidental service from their members, a number\r\nof smaller societies are growing up of which the members are bound\r\ntogether by much closer ties and more stringent obligations, and in\r\nsome cases even by solemn vows to renounce the world and to devote\r\nthemselves wholly to a life of social service. Many of them present\r\nfeatures of special interest which deserve recognition, but I must be\r\ncontent to describe one of them to which the personality of its founder\r\nlends exceptional importance. This is the society of \"The Servants of\r\nIndia,\" founded by Mr. Gokhale at Poona. Mr. Gokhale's career itself\r\nexemplifies the cross-currents that are often so perplexing a feature of\r\nIndian unrest. He is chiefly known in England as one of the leading and\r\ncertainly most interesting figures in Indian politics. A Chitpavan\r\nBrahman by birth, with the blood of the old dominant caste of\r\nMaharashtra in his veins, he has often been, both in the Viceroy's\r\nLegislative Council and in that of his own Presidency, a severe and even\r\nbitter critic of an alien Government, of which he nevertheless admits\r\nthe benefit, and even the necessity, for India. On the other hand,\r\nthough he proclaims himself a Nationalist, and though, on one occasion\r\nat least, when he presided over the stormy session of the Indian\r\nNational Congress at Calcutta in December, 1906, which endorsed the\r\nBengalee boycott movement, he lent the weight of his authority to a\r\npolicy that was difficult to reconcile with constitutional methods of\r\nopposition, his reason and his moral sense have always revolted against\r\nthe reactionary appeals to religious prejudice and racial hatred by\r\nwhich men like Tilak have sought to stimulate a perverted form of Indian\r\npatriotism. Highly educated both as a Western and an Eastern scholar, he\r\napproaches perhaps more nearly than any of his fellow-countrymen to the\r\nWestern type of doctrinaire, Radical in politics and agnostic in regard\r\nto religion, but with a dash of passion and enthusiasm which the Western\r\ndoctrinaire is apt to lack. When Tilak opened his first campaign of\r\nunrest in the Deccan by attacking the Hindu reformers, he found few\r\nstouter opponents than Mr. Gokhale, who was one of Ranade's staunchest\r\ndisciples and supporters. Nor did Tilak ever forgive him. His newspapers\r\nnever ceased to pursue him with relentless ferocity, and only last year\r\nMr. Gokhale had to appeal to the Law Courts for protection against the\r\nscurrilous libels of the \"extremist\" Press.\r\n\r\nHis own experiences in political life since he resigned his work as a\r\nprofessor at the Ferguson College in Poona in order to take a larger\r\nshare in public affairs have probably helped to convince Mr. Gokhale\r\nthat his fellow-countrymen for the most part still lack many essential\r\nqualifications for the successful discharge of those civic duties which\r\nare the corollary of the civic rights he claims for them. He does not,\r\nit is understood, desire to seek re-election to the Imperial Council at\r\nCalcutta after the expiry of its present powers, two years hence, as he\r\nwishes to devote himself chiefly to the educational work, which, in one\r\nform or another, has perhaps always been the most absorbing interest of\r\nhis life. When he was a professor at the Ferguson College teaching was\r\nwith him a vocation rather than a profession, and, if one may judge by\r\nhis practice, he believes that only those who are prepared to set an\r\nexample of selflessness and almost ascetic simplicity of life can hope\r\nto promote the moral and social as well as the political advancement of\r\nIndia. It is on these principles that he founded five years ago the\r\n\"Servants of India\" Society, recruited in the first instance amongst a\r\nfew personal followers and supported hitherto by the voluntary\r\ncontributions of his admirers. The objects of the Society as laid down\r\nby its promoters are \"to train national missionaries for the service of\r\nIndia and to promote by all constitutional means the true interests of\r\nthe Indian people.\" Its members \"frankly accept the British connexion as\r\nordained, in the inscrutable dispensation of Providence, for India's\r\ngood,\" and they recognize that \"self-government within the Empire and a\r\nhigher life generally for their countrymen\" constitute a goal which\r\n\"cannot be attained without years of earnest and patient effort and\r\nsacrifices worthy of the cause.\" As to its immediate functions, \"much of\r\nthe work,\" it is stated, \"must be directed towards building up in the\r\ncountry a higher type of character and capacity than is generally\r\navailable at present,\" and to this end the Society \"will train men\r\nprepared to devote their lives to the cause of the country in a\r\nreligious spirit.\" The constitution of the Society recalls in fact that\r\nof some of the great religious societies of Christendom, and not least\r\nthat of the Jesuits, though with this cardinal difference, that it is\r\nessentially non-sectarian and substitutes as its ideal the service of\r\nIndia for the service of God, much in the same way as the Japanese have\r\nto a large extent merged their religious creeds in an idealized cult of\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nEvery \"Servant of India\" takes at the time of admission into the society\r\nthe following seven vows;--\r\n\r\n   (a) That the country will always be first in his thoughts,\r\n   and that he will give to her service the best that is in him.\r\n\r\n   (b) That in serving the country he will seek no personal\r\n   advantage for himself.\r\n\r\n   (c) That he will regard all Indians as brothers and will\r\n   work for the advancement of all, without distinction of caste\r\n   or creed.\r\n\r\n   (d) That he will be content with such provision for himself\r\n   and his family, if any, as the society may be able to make,\r\n   and will devote no part of his energies to earning money for\r\n   himself.\r\n\r\n   (e) That he will lead a pure personal life.\r\n\r\n   (f) That he will engage in no personal quarrel with any one.\r\n\r\n   (g) That he will always keep in view the aims of the society\r\n   and watch over its interests with the utmost zeal, doing all\r\n   he can to advance its work and never doing anything inconsistent\r\n   with its objects.\r\n\r\nThe head of the society, called the First Member--who is Mr. Gokhale--is\r\nto hold office for life, and its affairs are to be conducted in\r\naccordance with by-laws framed for the purpose by the First Member, who\r\nwill be assisted by a council of three, one of whom will be his own\r\nnominee, whilst two will be elected by the ordinary members. The powers\r\nassigned to the First Member are very extensive and include that of\r\nrecommending the names of three ordinary members, one of whom, when the\r\ntime comes, shall be chosen to succeed him. His authority is, in fact,\r\nthe dominant one, whether over the probationers under training for a\r\nperiod of five years, three of which are to be spent at the society's\r\nhome in Poona, or over the ordinary members admitted to the full\r\nprivileges of the society, or over those who, as _attachés_, associates,\r\nand permanent assistants, are very closely affiliated to it without\r\nbeing actually received into membership. The scheme is, of course, at\r\npresent in its infancy, as the society still numbers only about 25, the\r\nmajority of whom have not yet completed their term of probation. Mr.\r\nGokhaie, however, hopes very soon to have 50 probationers constantly in\r\nresidence, and he has already gathered together in the well-appointed\r\nbuildings of the society's home just outside Poona, in close proximity\r\nto the Ferguson College, a group of young men, to some of whom he kindly\r\nintroduced me, who have evidently caught the fervour of his enthusiasm.\r\nOne of the latest recruits was by birth a Mahomedan, of whom Mr. Gokhale\r\nwas specially proud, as he is very anxious that the society shall be, in\r\nfact as well as in theory, representative of all castes and creeds.\r\n\r\nOne of the first questions which this remarkable experiment suggests is\r\nwhether the ideals which Mr. Gokhale sets before the \"Servants of India\"\r\nwill suffice to supply the necessary driving power. Hitherto some form\r\nof religious faith and the hope of some heavenly reward have alone\r\navailed to induce men to renounce the world and all its material\r\ninterests and surrender themselves to a life of rigorous and selfless\r\ndiscipline in the service of their fellow-creatures, or rather in the\r\nservice of God through their fellow-creatures. Mr. Gokhale's society\r\nmakes no claim to any religious sanction. Though Indian asceticism has\r\nfrom the most remote times found devotees willing to lead a life of far\r\nmore complete self-annihilation than any that the most rigorous\r\nmonastic orders of Christendom have ever imposed, or that, for the\r\nmatter of that, Mr. Gokhale seeks to impose upon his followers, it has\r\nalways been inspired by some religious conception. Will the \"Servants of\r\nIndia\" find the same permanent inspiration in the cult of an Indian\r\nMotherland, however highly spiritualized, that has no rewards to offer\r\neither in this world or in any other? On the political as well as other\r\npotentialities of such an organization as Mr. Gokhale contemplates there\r\nis no need to dwell. For the \"Servants of India,\" moulded by one mind\r\nand trained to obey one will, are to go forth as missionaries throughout\r\nIndia, in the highways and by-ways, among the \"untouchables\" as well as\r\namong the higher classes, preaching to each and all the birth of an\r\nIndian nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF WESTERN EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rising generation represent the India of the future, and though\r\nthose who come within the orbit of the Western education we have\r\nintroduced still constitute only a very small fraction of the whole\r\nyouth of India, their numbers and their influence are growing steadily\r\nand are bound to go on growing. If we are losing our hold over them, it\r\nis a poor consolation to be told that we still retain our hold over\r\ntheir elders. I therefore regard the estrangement of the young Indian,\r\nand especially of the young Hindu who has passed or is passing through\r\nour schools and colleges, as the most alarming phenomenon of the present\r\nday, and I am convinced that of all the problems with which British\r\nstatesmanship is confronted in India none is more difficult and more\r\nurgent than the educational problem. We are too deeply pledged now to\r\nthe general principles upon which our educational policy in India is\r\nbased for even its severest critics to contemplate the possibility of\r\nabandoning it. But for this very reason it is all the more important\r\nthat we should realize the grave defects of the existing system, or, as\r\nsome would say, want of system, in order that we may, so far as\r\npossible, repair or mitigate them. There can be no turning back, and\r\nsalvation lies not in doing less for Indian education, but in doing\r\nmore and in doing it better.\r\n\r\nFour very important features of the system deserve to be noted at the\r\noutset:--(1) Following the English practice, Government exercises no\r\ndirect control over educational institutions other than those maintained\r\nby the State, though its influence is brought in several ways indirectly\r\nto bear upon all that are not prepared to reject the benefits which it\r\ncan extend to them; (2) Government has concentrated its efforts mainly\r\nupon higher education, and has thus begun from the top in the\r\nover-sanguine belief that education would ultimately filter down from\r\nthe higher to the lower strata of Indian society; (3) instruction in the\r\nvarious courses, mostly literary, which constitute higher education is\r\nconveyed through the medium of English, a tongue still absolutely\r\nforeign to the vast majority; and (4) education is generally confined to\r\nthe training of the intellect and divorced not only, absolutely, from\r\nall religious teaching, but also, very largely, from all moral training\r\nand discipline, with the result that the vital side of education which\r\nconsists in the formation of character has been almost entirely\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nTo make the present situation intelligible, I must recapitulate, however\r\nbriefly, the phases through which our Indian system of education has\r\npassed. The very scanty encouragement originally given, to education by\r\nthe East India Company was confined to promoting the study of the\r\nOriental languages still used at that time in the Indian Courts of Law\r\nin order to qualify young Indians for Government employment and chiefly\r\nin the subordinate posts of the judicial service. After long and fierce\r\ncontroversies on the rival merits of the vernaculars and of English as\r\nthe more suitable vehicle for the expansion of education, Macaulay's\r\nfamous Minute of March 7, 1835, determined a revolution of which only\r\nvery few at the time foresaw, however faintly, the ultimate\r\nconsequences. Lord William Bentinck's Government decided that \"the\r\ngreat object of the British Government ought to be the promotion of\r\nEnglish literature and science, and that all the funds appropriated for\r\nthe purpose of education would be best employed in English education\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nAnother influence--too often forgotten--had at least as large a share as\r\nMacaulay's in this tremendous departure. That was the influence of the\r\ngreat missionary, Dr. Alexander Duff, who inspired the prohibition of\r\nsuttee and other measures which marked the withdrawal of the countenance\r\noriginally given by the East India Company to religious practices\r\nincompatible, in the opinion of earnest Christians, with the sovereignty\r\nof a Christian Power. Duff had made up his mind, in direct opposition to\r\nCarey and other earlier missionaries, that the supremacy of the English\r\nlanguage over the vernaculars must be established as a preliminary to\r\nthe Christianization of India. He had himself opened in 1830 an English\r\nschool in Calcutta with an immediate success which had confounded all\r\nhis opponents. His authority was great both at home and in India, and\r\nwas reflected equally in Lord Hardinge's Educational Order of 1844,\r\nwhich threw a large number of posts in the public service open to\r\nEnglish-speaking Indians without distinction of race or creed, and in\r\nSir Charles Wood's Educational Despatch of 1854, which resulted in the\r\ncreation of a Department for Public Instruction, the foundation of the\r\nthree senior Universities of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, the\r\naffiliation to them of schools and colleges for purposes of examination,\r\nand the inauguration of the \"grant-in-aid\" system for the encouragement\r\nof native educational enterprise by guaranteeing financial support\r\naccording to a fixed scale to all schools that satisfied certain tests\r\nof efficiency in respect of secular instruction. Duff's influence had\r\nassured the supremacy of English in secular education, but he never\r\nsucceeded in inducing Government to go a step beyond neutrality in\r\nregard to religious education, and though the remarkable successes which\r\nhe had in the meantime achieved, not only as a teacher but as a\r\nmissionary, amongst the highest classes of Calcutta society no doubt led\r\nhim to hope that, even without any active co-operation from Government,\r\nthe spread of English education would in itself involve the spread of\r\nboth Christian ethics and Christian doctrine, he never ceased to preach\r\nthe necessity of combining religious and moral with secular education or\r\nto prophesy the evils which would ensue from their divorce.\r\n\r\nThe system inaugurated by the Educational Minute of 1835 and developed\r\nin the Educational Orders of 1854 began well. The number of young\r\nIndians who took advantage of it was relatively small. They were drawn\r\nmostly from the better classes, and they were brought into direct\r\ncontact with their English teachers, many of them very remarkable men\r\nwhose influence naturally, and often unconsciously, helped to form the\r\ncharacter of their pupils as well as to develop their intellect--and\r\nmost of all, perhaps, in the mission schools; for the Christian missions\r\nwere at that time the dominant factor in Indian educational work. In\r\n1854 when there were only 12,000 scholars in all the Government schools,\r\nmission schools mustered four times that number and the rights they\r\nacquired, under the Orders of 1854, to participate in the new\r\n\"grants-in-aid\" helped them to retain the lead which in some respects,\r\nthough not as to numbers, they still maintain. For more than 50 years\r\nafter the Minute of 1835, and especially during the two or three decades\r\nthat followed the Orders of 1854, the new system produced a stamp of men\r\nwho seemed fully to justify the hopes of its original founders--not\r\nmerely men with a sufficient knowledge of English to do subordinate work\r\nas clerks and minor _employés_ of Government, but also men of great\r\nintellectual attainments and of high character, who filled with\r\ndistinction the highest posts open to Indians in the public service, sat\r\non the Bench, and practised at the Bar, and, in fact, made a mark for\r\nthemselves in the various fields of intellectual activity developed by\r\ncontact with the West. It is much to be regretted that no _data_ have\r\never been collected to show what proportion men of this stamp bore to\r\nthe aggregate number of students under the new system. The proportion\r\nwas certainly small, but it was at any rate large enough to reflect\r\ncredit upon the system as a whole and to disguise its inherent defects.\r\nIt is characteristic of the narrowness of official interest in\r\neducational questions that, whereas abundant statistics are forthcoming\r\non all subjects connected with material progress, no attempt seems to\r\nhave been made to follow the results of Western education statistically\r\ninto the after-life of high school pupils and college students. We know\r\nthat a certain number have emerged into public distinction, but there is\r\nnothing to show, except in the most, general way, how many have turned\r\ntheir education to humbler but still profitable account, or how many\r\nhave turned it to no account at all.\r\n\r\nParadoxical as it may sound, it is the eagerness of young India to\r\nrespond to our educational call that has led to the breakdown of the\r\nsystem in some of the most important functions of education. In its\r\nearlier stages those who claimed the benefit of the new system were\r\nchiefly drawn from the intellectual _élite_--i.e., from the classes\r\nwhich had had the monopoly of knowledge, though it was not Western\r\nknowledge, before the introduction of Western education. With the\r\nsuccess which the new system achieved the demand grew rapidly, and the\r\nquality of the output diminished as it increased in quantity. On the one\r\nhand education came to be regarded by the Indian public less and less as\r\nan end in itself, and more and more as merely an avenue either to\r\nlucrative careers or to the dignified security of appointments, however\r\nmodest, under Government, and, in either case, to a higher social\r\n_status_, which ultimately acquired a definite money value in the\r\nmatrimonial market. The grant-in-aid system led to the foundation of\r\nlarge numbers of schools and colleges under private native management,\r\nin which the native element became gradually supreme or at least vastly\r\npredominant, and it enabled them to adopt so low a scale of fees that\r\nmany parents who had never dreamt of literacy for themselves were\r\nencouraged to try and secure for some at least of their children the\r\nbenefit of this miraculous Open Sesame to every kind of worldly\r\nadvancement. Much of the raw material pressed into secondary schools was\r\nquite unsuitable, and little or no attempt was made to sift it in the\r\nrough. Numbers therefore began to drop out somewhere on the way,\r\ndisappointed of their more ambitious hopes and having acquired just\r\nenough new ideas to unfit them for the humbler work to which they might\r\notherwise have been brought up[17]. On the other hand, whilst schools\r\nand colleges, chiefly under private native management, were multiplied\r\nin order to meet the growing demand, the instruction given in them\r\ntended to get petrified into mechanical standards, which were appraised\r\nsolely or mainly by success in the examination lists. In fact, education\r\nin the higher sense of the term gave way to the mere cramming of\r\nundigested knowledge into more or less receptive brains with a view to\r\nan inordinate number of examinations, which marked the various stages of\r\nthis artificial process. The personal factor also disappeared more and\r\nmore in the relations between scholars and teachers as the teaching\r\nstaff failed to keep pace with the enormous increase in numbers.\r\n\r\nAll these deteriorating influences, though they were perhaps not then so\r\nvisible on the surface, were already at work in the 80's, when two\r\nimportant Government Commissions were held whose labours, with the most\r\nexcellent intentions, were destined to have directly and indirectly, the\r\nmost baneful effects upon Indian education. The one was the Education\r\nCommission of 1882-83, appointed by Lord Ripon, with Sir William Hunter\r\nas President, and the other the Public Service Commission of 1886-87,\r\nappointed by Lord Dufferin, with Sir Charles Aitchison as President. It\r\nis quite immaterial whether the steps taken by the Government of India\r\nduring the subsequent decade were actually due to the recommendations of\r\nthe Education Commission, or whether the Report of the Commission merely\r\nafforded a welcome opportunity to carry into practice the views that\r\nwere then generally in the ascendant. The eloquence of the Commission,\r\nif I may borrow the language appropriately used to me by a very\r\ncompetent authority, was chiefly directed towards representing the\r\nimportant benefits that would be likely to accrue to Government and to\r\neducation by the relaxation of Government's control over education, the\r\nwithdrawal of Government from the management of schools, and the\r\nadoption of a general go-as-you-please policy. Amongst the definite\r\nresults which we undoubtedly owe to the labours of that Commission was\r\nthe acclimatization in India of Sir Robert Lowe's system of \"payment by\r\nresults,\" which was then already discredited in England. Just at the\r\ntime when the transfer of the teacher's influence from European into\r\nnative hands was being thus accelerated, the Public Service Commission,\r\nnot a single member of which was an educational officer, produced a\r\nseries of recommendations which had the effect of changing very much for\r\nthe worse the position and prospects of Indians in the Educational\r\nDepartment. Before the Commission sat, Indians and Europeans used to\r\nwork side by side in the superior graded service of the Department, and\r\nuntil quite recently they had drawn the same pay. The Commission\r\nabolished this equality and comradeship and put the Europeans and the\r\nIndians into separate pens. The European pen was named the Indian\r\nEducational Service, and the native pen was named the Provincial\r\nEducational Service. Into the Provincial Service were put Indians\r\nholding lower posts than any held by Europeans and with no prospect of\r\never rising to the _maximum_ salaries hitherto within their reach. To\r\npretend that equality was maintained under the new scheme is idle, and\r\nthe grievance thus created has caused a bitterness which is not allayed\r\nby the fact that the Commission created analogous grievances in other\r\nbranches of the public service. Nor was this all the mischief done. It\r\nquickened the impulse already given by the Education Commission by\r\nformally recommending that the recruitment of Englishmen for the\r\nEducation Department should be reduced to a _minimum_, and, especially,\r\nthat even fewer inspectors of schools than the totally inadequate number\r\nthen existing should be recruited from England. It is interesting to\r\nnote in view of subsequent developments that, whilst this recommendation\r\nwas tacitly ignored by the Provincial Governments in some parts of\r\nIndia, as in Madras and in Bombay, it was accepted and applied in\r\nBengal--i.e., in the province where our educational system has\r\ndisplayed its gravest shortcomings.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward the dominant influence in secondary schools and\r\ncolleges drifted steadily and rapidly out of the hands of Englishmen\r\ninto those of Indians long before there was a sufficient supply of\r\nnative teachers fitted either by tradition or by training to conduct an\r\nessentially Western system of education. Not only did the number of\r\nnative teachers increase steadily and enormously, but that of the\r\nEuropean teachers actually decreased. Dr. Ashutosh Mookerjee, the\r\nVice-Chancellor of the Calcutta University, told me, for instance, that\r\nwhen he entered the Presidency College about 1880 all the professors,\r\nexcept a few specialists for purely Oriental subjects, were English, and\r\nthe appointment, whilst he was there, of an Indian for the first time as\r\nan ordinary professor created quite a sensation. Last year there were\r\nonly eight English professors as against 23 Indians, though, during the\r\nsame 30 years, the number of pupils had increased from a little over 350\r\nto close on 700--i.e., it had nearly doubled. The Calcutta Presidency\r\nCollege is, even so, far better off in this respect than most colleges\r\nexcept the missionary institutions, in which the European staff of\r\nteachers has been maintained at a strength that explains their continued\r\nsuccess. Out of 127 colleges there are 30 to-day with no Europeans at\r\nall on the staff, and these colleges contain about one-fifth of the\r\nstudents in all colleges. Of the other colleges 16 have only one\r\nEuropean professor, 21 only two, and so forth. In the secondary schools\r\nthe proportion of native to European teachers is even more overwhelming.\r\nFrom the point of view of mere instruction the results have been highly\r\nunsatisfactory. From the point of view of moral training and discipline\r\nand the formation of character they have been disastrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN STUDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fundamental weakness of our Indian educational system is that the\r\naverage Indian student cannot bring his education into any direct\r\nrelation with the world in which, outside the class or lecture room, he\r\ncontinues to live. For that world is still the old Indian world of his\r\nforefathers, and it is as far removed as the poles asunder from the\r\nWestern world which claims his education. I am not speaking now of the\r\nrelatively still very small class amongst whom Western ideas are already\r\nsufficiently acclimatized for the parents to be able to supplement in\r\ntheir own homes the education given to their children in our schools and\r\ncolleges. Nor am I speaking of the students who live in hostels under\r\nthe superintendence of high-minded Englishmen, and especially of\r\nmissionaries such as those of the Oxford Mission in Calcutta, or the\r\nMadras Christian College, who have to reject scores of applicants for\r\nwant of space. Those also form but a small minority. In Calcutta, for\r\ninstance, out of 4,500 students barely 1,000 live in hostels, and not\r\nall hostels are by any means satisfactory. In the Indian Universities\r\nthere is no collegiate life such as English Universities afford, and in\r\nIndia most of the secondary schools as well as colleges are\r\nnon-residential. The majority of those who attend them, unless they live\r\nat home, have therefore to board out with friends or to live in\r\npromiscuous messes, or, as is too often the case, in lodgings of a very\r\nundesirable character, sometimes even in brothels, and almost always\r\nunder conditions intellectually, morally, and physically deleterious.\r\n\r\nLest I may be accused of exaggeration or bias, I will appeal here to the\r\ntestimony of Dr. Garfield Williams, a missionary of the highest repute\r\nand experience, and in profound sympathy with the natives of India.\r\nSpeaking at the Missionary Conference at Calcutta last winter, he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n   The conditions and environment of the student in Calcutta\r\n   are such as to make the formation of character almost impossible....\r\n   He is not a student in the best sense of\r\n   the word, for he has not the scholarly instincts of a student--\r\n   I speak, of course, of the average student, not of the exceptional\r\n   one. His parents send him to the University to pass\r\n   one or two examinations, and these have to be passed in order\r\n   to enable him to attain a higher salary.... His work\r\n   is sheer \"grind.\" The acquisition of good notes for lectures\r\n   is the first essential for him, and the professor who gives\r\n   good clear-cut notes so that a man can dispense with any\r\n   text-books is the popular professor--and for two reasons:\r\n   first of all, it saves the expense of buying the text-book,\r\n   and then, of course, it helps to get through the examination.\r\n   That is a reason why two boys of the same village will go\r\n   to different colleges because they can then \"swap\" notes.\r\n   It is a very rare thing for a student to have money enough\r\n   to buy more than one of the suggested books on a given\r\n   subject for examination. He learns by heart one book\r\n   and the notes of lectures of two or three of the favourite\r\n   professors in Calcutta. There is many a man who has even\r\n   got through his examinations without any text-book of any\r\n   kind to help him, simply by committing to memory volumes\r\n   of lecture notes.... I know of no student who labours\r\n   more strenuously than the Bengalee student. The question\r\n   is how to prevent this ridiculous wastage of students;\r\n   how to prevent the production of this disappointed man\r\n   who is a student only in name. He never had any desire\r\n   to be a student in nature; he was brought up without that\r\n   desire ... and indeed, if he be a boy with real scholarly\r\n   instincts, and he happens to fail in his examinations, it makes\r\n   it all the worse, for his parents will not recognize those\r\n   scholarly instincts of his--all they want is a quick return\r\n   for the money spent on his education, and he will have to\r\n   make that return from a Rs.30 salary instead of a Rs.50 one.\r\n\r\nCan there be anything more pathetic and more alarming than the picture\r\nthat Dr. Williams draws of the student's actual life?--\r\n\r\n   He gets up about 6, and having dressed (which is not a\r\n   long process) he starts work. Until 10, if you go into his\r\n   mess, you will see him \"grinding\" away at his text-book,\r\n   under the most amazing conditions for work--usually stretched\r\n   out upon his bed or sitting on the side of it. The room is\r\n   almost always shared with some other occupant, usually\r\n   with two or three or more other occupants, mostly engaged\r\n   in the same task if they are students. At 10 the\r\n   boy gets some food, and then goes of to his college for about\r\n   four or five hours of lectures. A little after 3 in the afternoon\r\n   he comes home to his mess, and between 3 and 5 is usually\r\n   seen lounging about his room, dead tired but often engaged\r\n   in discussion with his room-mates or devouring the newspaper,\r\n   which is his only form of recreation and his only bit of excitement.\r\n   At 5 he will go out for a short stroll down College-street\r\n   or around College-square. This is his one piece of\r\n   exercise, if such you can call it. At dusk he returns to his\r\n   ill-lighted, stuffy room and continues his work, keeping it up,\r\n   with a short interval for his evening meal, until he goes to\r\n   bed, the hour of bed-time depending upon the proximity\r\n   of his examination. A very large percentage when they\r\n   actually sit for their examinations are nothing short of\r\n   physical wrecks.\r\n\r\nDr. Williams proceeds to quote Dr. Mullick, an eminent Hindu physician\r\nwho has devoted himself to helping young students:--\r\n\r\n   The places where the students live huddled up together\r\n   are most hurtful to their constitutions. The houses are\r\n   dirty, dingy, ill-ventilated, and crowded. Even in case of\r\n   infectious sickness ... they lie in the same place as\r\n   others, some of whom they actually infect. Phthisis is getting\r\n   alarmingly common among students owing to the sputum of\r\n   infected persons being allowed to float about with the dust\r\n   in crowded messes.... Most of them live in private\r\n   messes where a hired cook and single servant have complete\r\n   charge of his food and house-keeping, and things are stolen,\r\n   foodstuffs are adulterated, badly cooked and badly served.\r\n\r\nDr. Williams, who states emphatically that \"it is not exaggeration to\r\nsay that the student is often half-starved,\" goes on to deal with the\r\nmoral drawbacks of a life which is under no effective supervision and is\r\nnot even under the restraints, implied in the term \"good form,\" that\r\nplay so important a part in Universities where there is a real\r\ncollegiate life.\r\n\r\n   When you segregate your young men by thousands in the\r\n   heart of this \"city of dreadful night,\" amid conditions of\r\n   life which are most antagonistic to moral and physical well-being...\r\n   the result is a foregone conclusion, and it\r\n   does not only mean physical degeneration, it also means moral\r\n   degeneration, and it becomes a most potent predisposing\r\n   factor in political disease. Of that there can be no shadow\r\n   of doubt.\r\n\r\nThe material conditions are not, it is true, nearly so bad in many other\r\nparts of India as they are in Bengal, and especially in Calcutta (though\r\nthe Bengalees claim the intellectual primacy of India), and it is on the\r\nmoral and physical evils produced by those conditions that Dr. Garfield\r\nWilliams chiefly dwells. But the intellectual evils for all but a small\r\nminority are in their way quite as grave, and they are inherent to the\r\nsystem. Take the case of a boy brought up until he is old enough to go\r\nto school in some small town of the _mofussil_, anywhere in India, by\r\nparents who have never been drawn into any contact, however remote, with\r\nWestern ideas or Western knowledge. From these purely Indian\r\nsurroundings his parents, who are willing to stint themselves in order\r\nthat their son may get a post under Government, send him to a secondary\r\nschool, let us say in the chief town of the district, or in a University\r\ncity. There again he boards with friends of his family, if they have\r\nany, or in more or less reputable lodgings amidst the same purely Indian\r\nsurroundings, and his only contact with the Western world is through\r\nschool-books in a foreign tongue, of which it is difficult enough for\r\nhim to grasp even the literal meaning, let alone the spirit, which his\r\nnative teachers have themselves too often only, very partially imbibed\r\nand are therefore quite unable to communicate[18]. From the secondary\r\nschool he passes for his University course, if he gets so far, in\r\nprecisely the same circumstances into a college which is merely a higher\r\nform of school. Whilst attending college our student still continues to\r\nlive amidst the same purely Indian surroundings, and his contact with\r\nthe Western world is still limited to his text-books. Even the best\r\nnative teacher can hardly interpret that Western world to him as a\r\ntrained European can, and unless our student intends to become a doctor\r\nor an engineer, and has to pass through the schools of medicine or\r\nengineering, where he is bound to be a good deal under English teachers,\r\nhe may perfectly well, and very often does, go through his whole course\r\nof studies in school and in college without ever coming into personal\r\ncontact with an Englishman. How can he be expected under such conditions\r\nto assimilate Western knowledge or to form even a remote conception of\r\nthe customs and traditions, let alone the ideals, embodied in Western\r\nknowledge?\r\n\r\nTry and imagine for a moment, however absurd it may seem, what would\r\nhave been the effect upon the brains of the youth of our own country if\r\nit had been subject to Chinese rule for the last 100 years, and the\r\nChinese, without interfering with our own social customs or with our\r\nreligious beliefs, had taken charge of higher education and insisted\r\nupon conveying to our youth a course of purely Chinese instruction\r\nimparted through Chinese text-books, and taught mainly by Englishmen,\r\nfor the most part only one degree more familiar than their pupils with\r\nthe inwardness of Chinese thought and Chinese ethics. The effect could\r\nhardly have been more bewildering than the effect produced in many cases\r\nsimilar to that which I have instanced on the brain of the Indian youth\r\nwhen he emerges from our schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that such cases are extreme cases, but extreme as they\r\nare, they are not exceptional. The exceptions must be sought rather\r\namongst the small minority, who, in spite of all these drawbacks,\r\ndisplay such a wonderful gift of assimilation, or, it might perhaps be\r\nmore correctly termed, of intuition, that they are able to transport\r\nthemselves into a new world of thought, or at any rate to see into it,\r\nas it were, through a glass darkly. But the number of those who possess\r\nthis gift has probably always been small, and smaller still, with the\r\nreduction of the European element in the teaching staff, is the number\r\ngrowing of those who have a fair chance of developing that gift, even if\r\nnature has endowed them with it. A comparison of the Census Report of\r\n1901 with the figures given in the Educational Statistics for 1901-2\r\nshows that the total number of Europeans then engaged in Indian\r\neducational work was barely, 500, of whom less than half were employed\r\nby Government, whilst that of the Indians engaged in similar work in\r\ncolleges and secondary schools alone was about 27,500. As the number of\r\nIndian students and scholars receiving higher education amounts to\r\nthree-quarters of a million, it is obvious that so slight a European\r\nleaven, whatever its quality--and its quality is not always what it\r\nshould be--can produce but little impression upon so huge a mass.\r\n\r\nOur present system of Indian education in fact presents in an\r\nexaggerated form, from the point of view of the cultivation of the\r\nintellect, most of the defects alleged against a classical education by\r\nits bitterest opponents in Western countries, where, after all, the\r\nclassics form only a part, however important, of the curriculum, and\r\nneither Latin nor Greek is the only medium for the teaching of every\r\nsubject. From the point of view of the formation of character according\r\nto Western standards, and even from that of physical improvement, the\r\ncase is even worse. In Western countries the education given in our\r\nschools, from the Board school to the University, is always more or\r\nless on the same plane as that of the class from which the boys who\r\nattend them are drawn. It is merely the continuation and the complement\r\nof the education our children receive in their own homes from the moment\r\nof their birth, and it moves on the same lines as the world in which\r\nthey live and move and have their being. In India, with rare exceptions,\r\nit is not so, but exactly the reverse.\r\n\r\nOn the deficiencies of the system, from the moral point of view, a new\r\nand terribly lurid light has been shed within the last few years. There\r\nhas been no more deplorable feature in the present political agitation\r\nthan the active part taken in it by Indian schoolboys and students. It\r\nhas been a prominent feature everywhere, but nowhere more so than in the\r\nBengal provinces, where from the very outset of the boycott movement in\r\n1905 picketing of the most aggressive character was conducted by bands\r\nof young Hindus who ought to have been doing their lessons. That was\r\nonly the beginning, and the state of utter demoralization that was\r\nultimately reached may be gathered from the following statements in the\r\nlast Provincial Report on Education (1908-9), issued by the Government\r\nof Eastern Bengal:--\r\n\r\n   On the 7th of August [1908] most of the Hindu students\r\n   abstained from attending the college and high schools at\r\n   Comilla as a demonstration in connexion with the boycott\r\n   anniversary. Immediately afterwards, on the date of the\r\n   execution of the Muzafferpur murderer, the boys of several\r\n   schools in the province attended barefooted and without\r\n   shirts and in some cases fasting.... At Jamalpur the\r\n   demonstration lasted a week.... Later in the year, on\r\n   the occasion of the execution of one of the Alipur murderers,\r\n   the pupils of the Sandip Cargill school made a similar demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe report adds, in a sanguine vein, that, as a result of various\r\ndisciplinary measures, a marked improvement had subsequently taken\r\nplace, but quite recent events, during the great conspiracy trial at\r\nDacca, show that something more than disciplinary measures is required\r\nto eradicate the spirit which inspired such occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest responsibility rests on those who, claiming to be the\r\nintellectual leaders of the country, not only instigated its youth to\r\ntake part in political campaigns, but actually placed them in the\r\nforefront of the fray. However reprehensible from our British point of\r\nview other features of a seditious agitation may be, to none does so\r\nhigh a degree of moral culpability attach as to the deliberate efforts\r\nmade by Hindu politicians to undermine the fundamental principles of\r\nauthority by stirring up the passions or appealing to the religious\r\nsentiment of inexperienced youth at the most emotional period of\r\nlife.[19] Even the fact that political murders have been invariably\r\nperpetrated by misguided youths of the student class is hardly as\r\nominous as the homage paid to the murderers' memories by whole schools\r\nand colleges. Most ominous of all is the tolerance, and sometimes the\r\nencouragement, extended to such demonstrations by schoolmasters and\r\nprofessors. These are symptoms that point to a grave moral disease\r\namongst the teachers as well as the taught, which we can only ignore at\r\nour peril and at the sacrifice of our duty towards the people of India.\r\nIn his last two Convocation speeches, Dr. Ashutosh Mookerjee has himself\r\nfelt constrained to lay special stress on the question of teachers and\r\npolitics. Alluding in 1909 to \"the lamentable events of the last 12\r\nmonths,\" he maintained, \"without hesitation,\" that \"the most strenuous\r\nefforts must be unfalteringly made by all persons truly interested in\r\nthe future of the rising generation to protect our youths from the hands\r\nof irresponsible people who recklessly seek to seduce our students from\r\nthe path of academic life and to plant in their immature minds the\r\npoisonous seeds of hatred against constituted Government.\" This year he\r\nwas even more outspoken, and laid it down that even the teacher \"who\r\nscrupulously abstains from political matters within his class-room, but\r\nat the same time devotes much or all of his leisure hours to political\r\nactivities and agitation, and whose name and speeches are prominently\r\nbefore the world in connexion with political organizations and\r\nfunctions,\" fails in his duty towards his pupils; for \"their minds will\r\ninevitably be attracted towards political affairs and political\r\nagitation if they evidently constitute the main life-interest and\r\nlife-work of one who stands towards them in a position of authority.\"\r\nTeachers should therefore avoid everything that tends \"to impart to the\r\nminds of our boys a premature bias towards politics.\"\r\n\r\nA most admirable exhortation; but I had an opportunity of estimating the\r\nweight that it carried with some of the political leaders of Bengal when\r\nI accepted an invitation from Mr. Surendranath Banerjee to meet a few\r\nBengalee students in an informal way and have a talk with them. They\r\nwere bright, pleasant lads, and, if they had been left to themselves, I\r\nmight have had an interesting talk with them about their studies and\r\ntheir prospects in life, but Mr. Banerjee and several other politicians\r\nwho were present insisted upon giving to the conversation a political\r\nturn of a disagreeably controversial character which seemed to me\r\nentirely out of place.\r\n\r\nThe mischievous incitements of politicians would not, however, have\r\nfallen on to such receptive soil if economic conditions, for which we\r\nare ourselves at least partly responsible, had not helped to create an\r\natmosphere in which political disaffection is easily bred amongst both\r\nteachers and taught. The rapid rise in the cost of living has affected\r\nno class more injuriously than the old clerkly castes from which the\r\nteaching staff and the scholars of our schools and colleges are mainly\r\nrecruited. Their material position now often compares unfavourably with\r\nthat of the skilled workman and even of the daily labourer, whose higher\r\nwages have generally kept pace with the appreciation of the necessaries\r\nof life. This is a cause of great bitterness even amongst those who at\r\nthe end of their protracted, course of studies get some small billet\r\nfor their pains. The bitterness is, of course, far greater amongst those\r\nwho fail altogether. The rapid expansion of an educational system that\r\nhas developed far in excess of the immediate purpose for which it was\r\noriginally introduced was bound to result in a great deal of\r\ndisappointment for the vast number of Indians who regarded it merely as\r\nan avenue to Government employment. For the demand outran the supply,\r\nand the deterioration in the quality of education consequent upon this\r\ntoo rapid expansion helped at the same time to restrict the possible\r\ndemand. F.A.'s (First Arts) and even B.A.'s are now too often drugs in\r\nthe market. Nothing is more pathetic than the hardships to which both\r\nthe young Indian and his parents will subject themselves in order that\r\nhe may reach the coveted goal of University distinctions, but\r\nunfortunately, as such distinctions are often achieved merely by a\r\nprocess of sterile cramming which leaves the recipients quite unable to\r\nturn mere feats of memory to any practical account, the sacrifices prove\r\nto have been made in vain. Whilst the skilled artisan, and even the\r\nunskilled labourer, can often command from 12 annas to 1 rupee (1s. to\r\n1s. 4d.) a day, the youth who has sweated himself and his family through\r\nthe whole course of higher education frequently looks in vain for\r\nemployment at Rs.30 (£2) and even at Rs.20 a month. In Calcutta not a\r\nfew have been taken on by philanthropic Hindus to do mechanical labour\r\nin jute mills at Rs.15 a month simply to keep them from starvation.\r\nThings have in fact reached this pitch, that our educational system is\r\nnow turning out year by year a semi-educated proletariat which is not\r\nonly unemployed, but in many cases almost unemployable. A Hindu\r\ngentleman who is one of the highest authorities on education told me\r\nthat in Bengal, where this evil has reached the most serious dimensions,\r\nhe estimates the number of these unemployed at over 40,000. This is an\r\nevil which no change in the relative number of Europeans and natives\r\nemployed in Government and other services could materially affect. Even\r\nif every Englishman left India, it would present just as grave a problem\r\nto the rulers of the country, except that the bitterness engendered\r\nwould not be able to vent itself, as it too often does now, on the alien\r\nrulers who have imported the alien system of education by which many of\r\nthose who fail believe themselves to have been cruelly duped.\r\n\r\nSimilar causes have operated to produce discontent amongst the teachers,\r\nwho in turn inoculate their pupils with the virus of disaffection. It\r\nwas much easier to multiply schools and colleges than to train a\r\ncompetent teaching staff. Official reports seldom care to look\r\nunpleasant facts in the face, and the periodical reports both of the\r\nImperial Department of Public Education and of the Provincial\r\nDepartments have always been inclined to lay more stress upon the\r\nmultiplication of educational institutions and the growth in the numbers\r\nof pupils and students than upon the weak points of the system.\r\nNevertheless, there is one unsatisfactory feature that the most\r\nconfirmed optimists cannot ignore. Hardly a single one of these reports\r\nbut makes some reference to the deficiencies and incapacity of the\r\nnative teaching staff. The last quinquennial report issued by Mr.\r\nOrange, the able Director-General of Public Education, who is now\r\nleaving India, contains a terse but very significant passage. \"Speaking\r\ngenerally,\" he writes, \"it may be said that the qualifications and the\r\npay of the teachers in secondary schools are below any standard that\r\ncould be thought reasonable; and the inquiries which are now being made\r\ninto the subject have revealed a state of things that is scandalous in\r\nBengal and Eastern Bengal, and is unsatisfactory in every province.\"\r\nVery little information is forthcoming as to the actual qualifications\r\nor pay of the teachers. It appears, however, from the inspection of high\r\nschools by the Calcutta University that out of one group of 3,054\r\nteachers over 2,100 receive salaries of less than 30 rupees (£2) a\r\nmonth. One cannot, therefore, be surprised to hear that in Bengal \"only\r\nmen of poor attainments adopt the profession, and the few who are well\r\nqualified only take up work in schools as a stepping-stone to some more\r\nremunerative career.\" That career is frequently found in the Press,\r\nwhere the disgruntled ex-schoolmaster adds his quota of gall to the\r\nliterature of disaffection. But he is still more dangerous when he\r\nremains a schoolmaster and uses his position to teach disaffection to\r\nhis pupils either by precept or by example.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the unfortunate effect of the recommendations\r\nof the Public Service Commission of 1886-7 on the native side of the\r\nEducation Service. But if it has become more difficult to attract to it\r\nthe right type of Indians, it has either become almost as difficult to\r\nattract the right type of Europeans, or the influence they are able to\r\nexercise has materially diminished. In the first place, their numbers\r\nare quite inadequate. Out of about 500 Europeans actually engaged in\r\neducational work in India less than half are in the service of the\r\nState. Many of them are admittedly very capable men, and not a few\r\npossess high University credentials. But so long as the Indian\r\nEducational Service is regarded and treated as an inferior branch of the\r\npublic service, we cannot expect its general tone to be what it should\r\nbe in view of the supreme importance of the functions it has to\r\ndischarge. One is often told that the conditions are at least as\r\nattractive as those offered by an educational career at home. Even if\r\nthat be so, it would not affect my contention that, considering how\r\nimmeasurably more difficult is the task of training the youth of an\r\nentirely alien race according to Western standards, and how vital that\r\ntask is for the future of British rule in India, the conditions should\r\nbe such as to attract, not average men, but the very best men that we\r\ncan produce. As it is, the Education Department cannot be said to\r\nattract the best men, for these go into the Civil Service, and only\r\nthose, as a rule, enter the Educational Service who either, having made\r\nup their minds early to seek a career in India, have failed to pass the\r\nCivil Service examinations, or, having originally intended to take up\r\nthe teaching profession in England, are subsequently induced to come out\r\nto India by disappointments at home or by the often illusory hope of\r\nbettering their material prospects. When they arrive they begin work\r\nwithout any knowledge of the character and customs of the people. Some\r\nare employed in inspection and others as professors, and the latter\r\nespecially are apt to lose heart when they realize the thanklessness of\r\ntheir task and their social isolation. In some cases indifference is the\r\nworst result, but in others--happily rare--they themselves, I am\r\nassured, catch the surrounding contagion of discontent, and their\r\ninfluence tends rather to promote than to counteract the estrangement of\r\nthe rising generation committed to their charge. Some men, no doubt,\r\nrise superior to all these adverse conditions and, in comparing the men\r\nof the present day with those of the past, one is apt to remember only\r\nthe few whose names still live in the educational annals of India and to\r\nforget the many who have passed away without making any mark. The fact,\r\nhowever, remains that nowadays the Europeans who have the greatest\r\ninfluence over their Indian pupils are chiefly to be found amongst the\r\nmissionaries with whom teaching is not so much a profession as a\r\nvocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nSOME MEASURES OF EDUCATIONAL REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough already in 1889, when Lord Lansdowne was Viceroy, an important\r\nresolution, drafted by Sir Anthony (now Lord) MacDonnell as Secretary to\r\nGovernment, was issued, drawing attention to some of the most glaring\r\ndefects of our educational system from the point of view of intellectual\r\ntraining and of discipline, and containing valuable recommendations for\r\nremedying them, it seems to have had very little practical effect. A\r\nmore fruitful attempt to deal with the question was made during Lord\r\nCurzon's Viceroyalty. He summoned and presided over an Educational\r\nConference, of which the results were embodied in a Government\r\nResolution issued on March 11, 1904, and in the Universities Act of the\r\nsame year. They were received at the time with a violent outburst of\r\nindignation by Indian politicians, who claim to represent the educated\r\nintellect of the country. The least that Lord Curzon was charged with\r\nwas a deliberate attempt to throttle higher education in India. This\r\nfactious outcry has now died away, except amongst the irreconcilables,\r\nand Dr. Ashutosh Mookerjee, an authority whom even Hindu partisanship\r\ncan hardly repudiate, declared in his last Convocation speech that the\r\nnew regulations which are now being brought into operation, far from\r\nbearing out the apprehensions of \"alarmist prophets,\" have been\r\ndistinctly beneficial to the better and stronger class of students.\r\n\r\nTo summarize very briefly the work of the Conference, it recognized in\r\nthe first place the importance of the vernaculars as the proper medium\r\nfor instruction in the lower stages of education, whilst maintaining the\r\nsupremacy of English in the higher stages. It sought to give a more\r\npractical character to high-school training by promoting the \"modern\r\nside,\" hitherto overshadowed by a mainly literary curriculum, and it\r\nendeavoured to make the school courses self-sufficing and self-contained\r\ninstead of merely a stepping-stone to the University courses. To this\r\nend secondary schools were encouraged to give more importance to School\r\nFinal Examinations as a general test of proficiency and not to regard\r\ntheir courses as almost exclusively preparatory to the University\r\nEntrance Examination. Great stress was also laid upon the improvement of\r\ntraining colleges for teachers as well as upon the development of\r\nspecial schools for industrial, commercial, and agricultural\r\ninstruction. Nor were the ethics of education, altogether forgotten in\r\ntheir bearings upon the maintenance of healthy discipline. Government\r\nemphasized the great importance of a large extension of the system of\r\nhostels or boarding-houses, under proper supervision, in connexion with\r\ncolleges and secondary schools, as a protection against the moral\r\ndangers of life in large towns; and whilst provision was made for the\r\nmore rigorous inspection of schools to test their qualifications both\r\nfor Government grants-in-aid and for affiliation to Universities,\r\ncertain reforms were also introduced into the constitution and\r\nmanagement of the Universities themselves.\r\n\r\nThe results already achieved are not inconsiderable. The provision of\r\nhostels, in which Lord Curzon was deeply interested, has made great\r\nprogress, and one may hope that the conditions of student life described\r\nby Dr. Garfield Williams in Calcutta are typical of a state of things\r\nalready doomed to disappear, though at the present rate of progress it\r\ncan only disappear very slowly. In Madras there is a fine building for\r\nthe Presidency College students and also for those of the Madras\r\nChristian College. In Bombay Government are giving money for the\r\nextension of the boarding accommodation of the three chief colleges. In\r\nAllahabad, Agra, Lucknow, Meerut, Bareilly, Lahore, and many other\r\ncentres old residential buildings are being extended or new ones\r\nerected. The new Dacca College, in the capital of Eastern Bengal, is one\r\nof the most conspicuous and noteworthy results of the Partition. In\r\nCalcutta itself little has been done except in the missionary\r\ninstitutions; and it is certainly very discouraging to note that an\r\nexcellent and very urgent scheme for removing the Presidency College,\r\nthe premier college of Bengal, from the slums in which it is at present\r\nin every way most injuriously confined, to a healthy suburban site has\r\nbeen shelved by the Bengal Government partly under financial pressure\r\nand partly because of the lukewarmness of native opinion. What is no\r\ndoubt really wanted is the wholesale removal of all the Colleges\r\nconnected with the Calcutta University altogether from their present\r\nsurroundings, but to refuse to make a beginning with the Presidency\r\nCollege is merely to prove once more that _le mieux est l'ennemi du\r\nbien_.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the University Entrance Examinations, the latest Madras\r\nreturns, which were alone sufficiently complete to illustrate the effect\r\nof the new regulations, showed that the increased stringency of the\r\ntests had resulted in a healthy decrease in the number of\r\nmatriculations, whilst the standard had been materially raised. In\r\nCalcutta the University inspection of schools and colleges and the\r\nexercise by the Universities of their discretionary powers in matters of\r\naffiliation have grown much more effective. That the powers of the\r\nUniversity Senates have not been unduly curtailed is only too clearly\r\nshown on the other hand by the effective resistance hitherto offered at\r\nBombay to the scheme of reforms proposed by Sir George Clarke. To the\r\nmost important features of the scheme, which were the provision of a\r\ncourse of practical science for all first-year students, a systematic\r\nbifurcation of courses, the lightening of the number of subjects in\r\norder to secure somewhat more thoroughness, and compulsory teaching of\r\nIndian history and polity, no serious objection could be raised, but the\r\npoliticians on the Senate effectively blocked discussion.\r\n\r\nA great deal still remains to be done, and can be done, on the lines of\r\nthe resolution of 1904. The speed at which it can be done must, no\r\ndoubt, be governed in some directions by financial considerations. The\r\nextension of the hostel system, for instance, which is indispensable to\r\nthe removal of some of the worst moral and physical influences upon\r\neducation, is largely a matter of money. So is too to some extent the\r\nstrengthening of the educational staff, European and native, which is\r\nalso urgently needed. The best Indians cannot be attracted unless they\r\nare offered a living wage in some measure consonant with the dignity of\r\nso important a profession, and our schools and colleges will continue to\r\nbe too often nursery grounds of sedition so long as we do not redress\r\nthe legitimate grievances of teachers on starvation wages. But though\r\nimproved prospects may attract better men in the future, the actual\r\ninefficiency of a huge army of native teachers, far too hastily\r\nrecruited and imperfectly trained, can at best be but slowly mended. We\r\nwant more and better training colleges for native teachers, but that is\r\nnot all. The great Mahomedan College at Aligarh, one of the best\r\neducational institutions in India, partly because it is wholly\r\nresidential, has obtained excellent results by sending some of its\r\nstudents who intend to return as teachers to study Western educational\r\nmethods in Europe after they have completed their course in India. The\r\nsame practice might be extended elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTo raise the standard of the Europeans in the Educational Service\r\nsomething more than a mere improvement of material conditions is\r\nrequired. Additions are being made to both the teaching and the\r\ninspecting staff. But what is above all needed is to get men to join who\r\nregard teaching not merely as a livelihood, but as a vocation, and to\r\ninform them with a better understanding both of the people whose\r\nchildren they have to train and of the character and methods of the\r\nGovernment they have to serve. This can hardly be done except by\r\nassociating the Educational Service much more closely with what are now\r\nregarded as the higher branches of the public service in India. No\r\nEnglishmen are in closer touch with the realities of Indian life than\r\nIndian civilians, and means must be found to break down the wall which\r\nnow rigidly separates the Educational Service from the Civil Service.\r\nOpportunities might usefully be given to young Englishmen when they\r\nfirst join the Educational Service in India to acquire a more intimate\r\nknowledge of Indian administrative work, as well as of the character and\r\ncustoms and language of the people amongst whom their lot is to be cast,\r\nby serving an apprenticeship with civilians in the _mofussil_. The\r\nappointment of such a very able civilian as Mr. Harcourt Butler to be\r\nthe first Minister of Education in India may be taken as an indication\r\nthat Lord Morley realizes the importance of rescuing the Educational\r\nService from the watertight compartment in which it has hitherto been\r\nmuch too closely confined. We can hardly hope to restore English\r\ninfluence over education to the position which it originally occupied.\r\nThere are 1,200 high schools for boys in India to-day, of which only\r\n220 are under public management, and, even for the latter, it would be\r\ndifficult to provide an English headmaster apiece. What we can do is to\r\nfollow up the policy which has been lately resumed of increasing the\r\nnumber of high schools under Government control, until we have at least\r\none in every district, and in every large centre one with an English\r\nheadmaster which should be the model school for the division.\r\n\r\nA much vexed question is whether it is impossible to raise the fees\r\ncharged for higher education with a view to checking the wastage which\r\nresults from the introduction into our schools and colleges of so much\r\nunsuitable raw material. The fees now charged for the University course\r\nare admittedly very low, even for Indian standards. The total cost of\r\nmaintaining an Indian student throughout his four years' college course\r\nranges from a _minimum_ of £40 to a _maximum_ of £110--i.e., from £10\r\nto £27 10s. per annum. The actual fees for tuition vary from three to\r\ntwelve rupees (4s. to 16s.) a month in different colleges. Very large\r\ncontributions, amounting roughly to double the total aggregate of fees,\r\nhave therefore to be made from public funds towards the cost of\r\ncollegiate education. Is it fair to throw so heavy a burden on the\r\nIndian taxpayer for the benefit of a very small section of the\r\npopulation amongst whom, moreover, many must be able to afford the\r\nwhole, or at least a larger proportion, of the cost of their children's\r\neducation? Is it wise by making higher instruction so cheap to tempt\r\nparents to educate children often of poor or mediocre abilities out of\r\ntheir own plane of life? Would it not be better at any rate to raise the\r\nfees generally and to devote the sums yielded by such increase to\r\nexhibitions and scholarships for the benefit of the few amongst the\r\nhumbler classes who show exceptional promise?\r\n\r\nAgainst this it is urged that it would be entirely at variance with\r\nIndian traditions to associate standards of knowledge with standards of\r\nwealth, and, in practice, education has, I understand, been found to be\r\nworst where the fees bear the greatest proportion to the total\r\nexpenditure. The same arguments equally apply for and against raising\r\nthe fees in secondary schools. In regard to the latter, however, the\r\nopponents of any general increase of fees make, nevertheless, a\r\nsuggestion which deserves consideration. In many schools the fees begin\r\nat a very low figure--eight annas (8d.) a month in the lowest forms and\r\nrise to three, four, and even five rupees (4s. 5s. 4d. and 6s. 8d.) a\r\nmonth in the highest forms. It is this initial cheapness which induces\r\nso many thoughtless parents to send their boys to secondary schools\r\nwithout having considered whether they can afford to keep them through\r\nthe whole course, whilst it fosters the notion that badly paid and badly\r\nqualified teachers are good enough for the early, which are often the\r\nmost important, stages, of a boy's education. To obviate these evils it\r\nis suggested that the fees for all forms should be equalized.\r\n\r\nI shall have occasion later on to point out the immense importance of\r\ngiving greater encouragement to scientific and technical education.\r\nGovernment service and the liberal professions are already overstocked,\r\nand it is absolutely necessary to check the tendency of young Indians to\r\ngo in for a merely literary education for which, even if it were more\r\nthorough than it can be under existing conditions, there is no longer\r\nany sufficient outlet. The demand which is arising all over India for\r\ncommercial and industrial development should afford an unrivalled\r\nopportunity of deflecting education into more useful and practical\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nSome better machinery than exists at present seems also to be required\r\nto bring the Educational Service into touch with parents. Education can\r\nnowhere be a question of mere pedagogics, and least of all in India. Yet\r\nthere is evidently a strong tendency to treat it as such. To take only\r\none instance, the tasks imposed upon schoolboys and students by the\r\nexigencies of an elaborate curriculum are often excessive, and there\r\nhave been cases when the intervention of other authorities has been\r\nnecessary to bring the education officers to listen to the reasonable\r\ngrievances of parents. If in these and other matters parents were more\r\nfreely consulted, they would probably be more disposed to give education\r\nofficers the support of their parental authority. There are many points\r\nupon which native opinion would not be so easily misled by\r\nirreconcilable politicians if greater trouble were taken to explain the\r\nquestions at issue.\r\n\r\nWhat is evidently much wanted is greater elasticity. In a country like\r\nIndia, which is an aggregation of many widely different countries, the\r\nneeds and the wishes of the people must differ very widely and cannot be\r\nmet by cast-iron regulations, however admirable in theory. It is\r\nearnestly to be hoped that the creation of a separate portfolio in the\r\nGovernment of India will not involve the strengthening of the\r\ncentralizing tendencies which have been the bane of Indian education\r\nsince the days of Macaulay, himself one of the greatest theorists that\r\never lived. We cannot afford to relax the very little control we\r\nexercise over education, but education is just one of the matters in\r\nwhich Provincial Governments should be trusted to ascertain, and to give\r\neffect to, the local requirements of the people. In another direction,\r\nhowever, the creation of a Ministry for Education should be all to the\r\ngood. If any real and comprehensive improvements are to be carried out\r\nthey will cost a great deal of money, and in the ordinary sense of the\r\nterm it will not be reproductive expenditure, though no expenditure, if\r\nwisely applied, can yield more valuable results. As a member of\r\nCouncil--i.e., as a member of the Government of India--Mr. Butler must\r\ncarry much greater weight in recommending the necessary expenditure than\r\na Director-General of Public Education or than a Provincial Governor,\r\nespecially as the expenditure will probably have to be defrayed largely\r\nout of Imperial and not merely out of Provincial funds. If the\r\neducational problem is the most vital and the most urgent one of all at\r\nthe present hour in India, it stands to reason that no more disastrous\r\nblunder could be made than to stint the new department created for its\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remains one vital aspect of the educational problem which was left\r\nuntouched by the Educational Resolution of 1904, and has been left\r\nuntouched ever since we entered three-quarters of a century ago on an\r\neducational experiment unparalleled in the world's history--a more\r\narduous experiment even than that of governing the 300 millions of India\r\nwith a handful of Englishmen. Many nations have conquered remote\r\ndependencies inhabited by alien races, imposed their laws upon them, and\r\nheld them in peaceful subjection, though even this has never been done\r\non the same scale of magnitude as by the British rulers of India. We\r\nalone have attempted to educate them in our own literature and science\r\nand to make them by education the intellectual partners of the\r\ncivilization that subdued them. Of the two tasks, that of government and\r\nthat of education, the latter is not by any means the easier. For good\r\ngovernment involves as little interference as possible with the beliefs\r\nand customs and traditions of the people, whereas good education means\r\nthe substitution for them of the intellectual and moral conceptions of\r\nwhat we regard as our higher civilization. Good government represents\r\nto that extent a process of conservation; good education must be\r\npartially a destructive, almost a revolutionary, process. Yet upon the\r\nmore difficult and delicate problems of education we have hitherto, it\r\nis to be feared, bestowed less thought and less vigilance than upon\r\nadministrative problems in India. The purpose we have had in view is\r\npresumably that which Dr. Ashutosh Mookerjee admirably defined in his\r\nlast address to the University of Calcutta as \"the raising up of loyal\r\nand honourable citizens for the welfare of the State.\" But is it a\r\npurpose which those responsible for our Indian system of education have\r\nkept steadily before them? Is it a purpose that could possibly be\r\nachieved by the _laisser faire_ policy of the State in regard to the\r\nmoral and religious side of education? If so, how is it that we have had\r\nof late such alarming evidence of our frequent failure to achieve it?\r\n\r\nThe divorce of education from religion is still on its trial in Western\r\ncountries, which rely upon a highly-developed code of ethics and an\r\ninherited sense of social and civic duty to supply the place of\r\nreligious sanctions. In India, as almost everywhere in the East,\r\nreligion in some form or another, from the fetish worship of the\r\nprimitive hill tribes to the Pantheistic philosophy of the most cultured\r\nBrahman or the stern Monotheism of the orthodox Moslem, is the dominant\r\nforce in the life both of every individual and of every separate\r\ncommunity to which the individual belongs. Religion is, in fact, the\r\nbasic element of Indian life, and morality apart from religion is an\r\nalmost impossible conception for all but an infinitesimal fraction of\r\nWestern-educated Indians. Hence, even if the attempt had been or were in\r\nthe future made to instil ethical notions into the minds of the Indian\r\nyouth independently of all religious teaching, it could only result in\r\nfailure. For the Hindu, perhaps more than for any other, religion\r\ngoverns life from the hour of his birth to that of his death. His birth\r\nand his death are in fact only links in a long chain of existences\r\ninexorably governed by religion. His religion may seem to us to consist\r\nchiefly of ritual and ceremonial observances which sterilize any higher\r\nspiritual life. But even if such an impression is not due mainly to our\r\nown want of understanding, the very fact that every common act of his\r\ndaily life is a religious observance, just as the caste into which he is\r\nborn has been determined by the degree in which he has fulfilled similar\r\nreligious observances in a former cycle of lives, shows how completely\r\nhis religion permeates his existence. The whole world in which he lives\r\nand moves and has his being, in so far as it is not a mere illusion of\r\nthe senses, is for him an emanation of the omnipresent deity that he\r\nworships in a thousand different shapes, from the grotesque to the\r\nsublime.\r\n\r\nYet in a country where religion is the sovereign influence we have, from\r\nthe beginning, absolutely ignored it in education. It is no doubt quite\r\nimpossible for the State in a country like India with so many creeds and\r\nsects, whose tenets are often repugnant to all our own conceptions not\r\nonly of religion but of morality, to take any direct part in providing\r\nthe religious instruction which would be acceptable to Indian parents.\r\nBut was it necessary altogether to exclude such instruction from our\r\nschools and colleges? Has not its exclusion tended to create in the\r\nminds of many Indians the belief that our professions of religious\r\nneutrality are a pretence, and that, however rigorously the State may\r\nabstain from all attempts to use education as a medium for Christian\r\npropaganda, it nevertheless uses it to undermine the faith of the rising\r\ngenerations in their own ancestral creeds? Even if they acquit us of any\r\ndeliberate purpose, are they not at any rate entitled to say that such\r\nhave been too often the results? Did not the incipient revolt against\r\nall the traditions of Hinduism that followed the introduction of Western\r\neducation help to engender the wholesale reaction against Western\r\ninfluences which, underlies the present unrest?\r\n\r\nFew problems illustrate more strikingly the tremendous difficulties that\r\nbeset a Government such as ours in India. On the one hand, Indian\r\nreligious conceptions are in many ways so diametrically opposed to all\r\nthat British rule stands for that the State cannot actively lend itself\r\nto maintain or promote them. On the other hand, they provide the ties\r\nwhich hold the whole fabric of Indian society together, and which cannot\r\nbe hastily loosened without serious injury and even danger to the State.\r\nThis has been made patent to the most careless observer by the events of\r\nthe last few years that have revealed, as with a lurid flash of\r\nlightning, the extent to which the demoralization of our schools and\r\ncolleges had proceeded. If any Englishman has doubts as to the connexion\r\nin this matter of cause and effect, let him ask respectable Indian\r\nparents who hold aloof from politics. They have long complained that the\r\nspirit of reverence and the respect for parental authority are being\r\nkilled by an educational system which may train the intellect and impart\r\nuseful worldly knowledge, but withdraws their youths from the actual\r\nsupervision and control of the parents or of the _guru_, who for\r\nspiritual guidance stood _in loco parentis_ under the old Hindu system\r\nof education, and estranges them from all the ideas of their own Hindu\r\nworld[20]. That parents often genuinely resent the banishment of all\r\nreligious influence from our schools and colleges appears from the fact\r\nthat many of them prefer to Government institutions those conducted by\r\nmissionaries in which, though no attempt is made to proselytize, a\r\nreligious, albeit a Christian, atmosphere is to some extent maintained.\r\nIt is on similar grounds also that the promoters of the new movement in\r\nfavour of \"National Schools\" advocate the maintenance of schools which\r\npurchase complete immunity from Government control by renouncing all the\r\nadvantages of grants-in-aid and of University affiliation. They have\r\nbeen started mainly under the patronage of \"advanced\" politicians, and\r\nhave too often turned out to be mere hot-beds of sedition, but their\r\n_raison d'être_ is alleged to be the right of Hindu parents to bring up\r\nHindu children in a Hindu atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFrom the opposite pole in politics, most of the ruling chiefs in their\r\nreplies to Lord Minto's request for their opinions on the growth of\r\ndisaffection call attention to this aspect of education, and the Hindu\r\nprinces especially lay great stress on the neglect of religious and\r\nmoral instruction. I will quote only the Maharajah of Jaipur, a Hindu\r\nruler universally revered, for his high character and great\r\nexperience:--\r\n\r\n   My next point has reference to the neglect there seems to\r\n   be of religious education, a point to which I drew your\r\n   Excellency's attention at the State banquet at Jaipur on the\r\n   29th October, 1909. I must say I have great faith in a system\r\n   of education, in which secular and religious instruction are\r\n   harmoniously combined, as the formation of character\r\n   entirely depends upon a basework of religion, and the noble\r\n   ideals which our sacred books put before the younger generation\r\n   will, I fervently hope, make them loyal and dutiful\r\n   citizens of the Empire. Such ideals must inevitably have\r\n   their effect on impressionable young men, and it is perhaps\r\n   due to such ideals that sedition and anarchy have obtained\r\n   so small a footing in the Native States as a whole. In the\r\n   Chiefs' College Conference, held at the Mayo College in 1904,\r\n   I impressed upon my colleagues the necessity of religious\r\n   education for the sons of the chiefs and nobles of Rajputana,\r\n   and it should be one of the principal objects in all schools for\r\n   the Pandits and the Moulvies to instil in the minds of their\r\n   pupils correct notions as to the duty they owe to the community\r\n   they belong to and to their Sovereign.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the ruling chiefs unquestionably reflect the views which\r\nprevail amongst the better-class Indians in British India as well as in\r\nthe Native States. The Government of India cannot afford to disregard\r\nthem. The Resolution of 1904, it is true, laid it down again definitely\r\nthat \"in Government institutions, the instruction is and must continue\r\nto be exclusively secular.\" But much has happened since 1904 to reveal\r\nthe evils which our educational system has engendered and to lend\r\nweight to the representations made by responsible exponents of sober\r\nIndian opinion in favour of one of the remedies which it is clearly\r\nwithin our power to apply. Nor need we really depart from our\r\ntime-honoured principle of neutrality in religious matters. All we have\r\nto do is to set apart, in the curriculum of our schools and colleges,\r\ncertain hours during which they will be open, on specified conditions,\r\nfor religious instruction in the creed in which the parents desire their\r\nchildren to be brought up. There is no call for compulsion. This is just\r\none of the questions in which the greatest latitude should be left to\r\nlocal Governments, who are more closely in touch than the Central\r\nGovernment with the sentiment and wishes of the different communities. I\r\nam assured that there would be little difficulty in forming local\r\ncommittees to settle whether there was a sufficiently strong feeling\r\namongst parents in favour of a course of religious instruction and to\r\ndetermine the lines upon which it should be given. Some supervision\r\nwould have to be exercised by the State, but in the Educational Service\r\nthere are, it is to be hoped, enough capable and enlightened\r\nrepresentatives of the different creeds to exercise the necessary amount\r\nof supervision in a spirit both of sympathy for the spiritual needs of\r\ntheir people and of loyalty to the Government they serve. It may be\r\nobjected that there are so many jarring sects, so many divisions of\r\ncaste, that it would be impossible ever to secure an agreement as to the\r\nform to be imparted to religious instruction. Let us recognize but not\r\noverrate the difficulty. In each of the principal religions of India a\r\nsubstantial basis can be found to serve as a common denominator between\r\ndifferent groups, as, for instance, in the Koran for all Mahomedans and\r\nin the Shastras for the great majority of high-caste Hindus. At any\r\nrate, if the effort is made and fails through no fault of ours, but\r\nthrough the inability of Indian parents to reconcile their religious\r\ndifferences, the responsibility to them will no longer lie with us.\r\n\r\nAnother objection will probably be raised by earnest Christians who\r\nwould hold themselves bound in conscience to protest against any\r\nfacilities being given by a Christian State for instruction in religious\r\nbeliefs which they reprobate. Some of these austere religionists may\r\neven go so far as to contend that, rather than tolerate the teaching of\r\n\"false doctrines,\" it is better to deprive Indian children of all\r\nreligious teaching. To censure of this sort, however, the State already\r\nlays itself open in India. There are educational institutions--and some\r\nof the best, like the Mahomedan College at Aligurh--maintained by\r\ndenominational communities on purpose to secure religious education. Yet\r\nthe State withdraws from them neither recognition nor assistance because\r\npupils are taught to be good Mahomedans or good Hindus. Why should it be\r\nwrong to make religious instruction permissive in other Indian schools\r\nwhich are not wholly or mainly supported by private endeavour? Is not\r\nthe \"harmonious combination of secular and religious instruction\" for\r\nwhich the Maharajah of Jaipur pleads better calculated than our present\r\npolicy of _laisser faire_ to refine and purify Indian religious\r\nconceptions, and to bring about that approximation of Eastern to Western\r\nideals, towards which the best Indian minds were tending before the\r\npresent revolt against Western ascendency?\r\n\r\nHere is surely a question bound up with all the main-springs of Indian\r\nlife in which we may be rightly asked \"to govern according to Indian\r\nideas.\" Can we expect that the youth of India will grow up to be\r\nlaw-abiding citizens if we deprive them of what their parents hold to be\r\n\"the keystone to the formation of character\"? Can we close our eyes to\r\nwhat so many responsible Indians regard as one of the chief causes of\r\nthe demoralization which has crept into our schools and colleges? The\r\nState can, doubtless, exact in many ways more loyal co-operation from\r\nIndian teachers in safeguarding their pupils from the virus of\r\ndisaffection. It can, for instance, intimate that it will cease to\r\nrecruit public servants from schools in which sedition is shown to be\r\nrife. It can hold them collectively responsible, as some Indians\r\nthemselves recommend for crimes perpetrated by youths whom they have\r\nhelped to pervert. But these are rigorous measures that we can hardly\r\ntake with a good conscience so long as our educational system can be\r\ncharged with neglecting or undermining, however unintentionally, the\r\nfabric upon which Indian conceptions of morality are based. So long as\r\nwe take no steps to refute a charge which, in view of recent evidence,\r\ncan no longer be dismissed as wholly unfounded, can we expect education\r\nto fulfil the purpose rightly assigned to it by Dr. Mookerjee--\"the\r\nraising up of loyal and honourable citizens for the welfare of the\r\nState?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nPRIMARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is too late in the day now to discuss whether it was wise to begin\r\nour educational policy as we did from the top and to devote so much of\r\nour energies and resources to secondary at the expense of primary\r\neducation. The result has certainly been to widen the gulf which divides\r\nthe different classes of Indian society and to give to those who have\r\nacquired some veneer, however superficial, of Western education the only\r\narticulate voice, often quite out of proportion to their importance, as\r\nthe interpreters of Indian interests and desires. One million is a\r\nliberal estimate of the number of Indians who have acquired and retained\r\nsome knowledge of English; whilst at the last census, out of a total\r\npopulation of 294 millions, less than sixteen millions could read and\r\nwrite in any language--not fifteen millions out of the whole male\r\npopulation and not one million out of the whole female population--and\r\nthis modest amount of literacy is mainly confined to a few privileged\r\ncastes.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of a school of Indian politicians bent upon undermining\r\nBritish rule, the almost inconceivable ignorance in which the masses are\r\nstill plunged has become a real danger to the State, for it has proved\r\nan all too receptive soil for the calumnies and lies of the political\r\nagitator, who, too well educated himself to believe what he retails to\r\nothers, knows exactly the form of calumny and lie most likely to appeal\r\nto the credulity of his uninformed fellow-countrymen. I refer\r\nespecially to such very widespread and widely believed stories as that\r\nGovernment disseminates plague by poisoning the wells and that it\r\nintroduces into the plague inoculation serum drugs which destroy\r\nvirility in order to keep down the birth-rate. No one has put this point\r\nmore strongly than Lord Curzon:--\r\n\r\n   What is the greatest danger in India? What is the source\r\n   of suspicion, superstition, outbreaks, crime---yes, and also\r\n   of much of the agrarian discontent and suffering amongst\r\n   the masses? It is ignorance. And what is the only antidote\r\n   to ignorance? Knowledge.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, it was one of Lord Curzon's bitterest opponents who\r\ncorroborated him on this point by relating in the course of a recent\r\ndebate how, when the Chinsurah Bridge was built some years ago over the\r\nHughli, \"the people believed that hundreds and thousands of men were\r\nbeing sacrificed and their heads cut off and carried to the river to be\r\nput under the piers to give the bridge stability, so that the goddess\r\nmight appreciate the gift and let the piers remain.\" And he added:--\"I\r\nknow that ignorant people were afraid to go out at nights, lest they\r\nmight be seized and their heads cut off and thrown under the piers of\r\nthe Hughli Bridge.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, however, on more general consideration, as is his wont, that Mr.\r\nGokhale moved his resolution in the first Session of the Imperial\r\nCouncil at Calcutta last winter for making elementary education free and\r\ncompulsory, and for the early appointment of a committee to frame\r\ndefinite proposals.\r\n\r\n   Three movements [he claimed] have combined to give\r\n   to mass education the place which it occupies at present\r\n   amongst the duties of the State--the humanitarian movement\r\n   which reformed prisons and liberated the slave, the\r\n   democratic movement which admitted large masses of men\r\n   to a participation in Government, and the industrial movement\r\n   which brought home to nations the recognition that\r\n   the general spread of education in a country, even when it\r\n   did not proceed beyond the elementary stage, meant the\r\n   increased efficiency of the worker.\r\n\r\nThe last of these three considerations is, perhaps, that which just now\r\ncarries the most weight with moderate men in India, where the general\r\ndemand for industrial and commercial development is growing loud and\r\ninsistent, and Mr. Gokhale's resolution met with very general support\r\nfrom his Mahomedan, as well as from his Hindu, colleagues. But, in the\r\nminds of disaffected politicians, another consideration is, it must be\r\nfeared, also present, to which utterance is not openly given. It is the\r\nhope that the extension of primary schools may serve, as has that of\r\nsecondary schools to promote the dissemination of seditious doctrines,\r\nespecially amongst the \"depressed castes\" to which the political\r\nagitator has so far but rarely secured access.\r\n\r\nWhatever danger may lie in that direction, it cannot be allowed to\r\naffect the policy of Government, who gave to Mr. Gokhale's resolution a\r\nsufficiently sympathetic reception to induce him to withdraw it for the\r\npresent. To the principle of extending primary education the Government\r\nof India have indeed long been committed, and increased efforts were\r\nrecommended, both in the Educational Despatch of 1854 and by the\r\nEducation Commission of 1883. Stress was equally laid upon it by the\r\nResolution of 1904 under Lord Curzon, who already, in 1902, had caused\r\nadditional grants, amounting to more than a quarter of a million\r\nsterling, to be given to provincial Governments for the purpose. Under\r\nLord Minto's administration Government seemed at one moment to have gone\r\nvery much further and to have accepted at any rate the principle of free\r\neducation, for in 1907 the Finance Member conveyed in Council an\r\nassurance from the Secretary of State that \"notwithstanding the absence\r\nof Budget provision, if a suitable scheme should be prepared and\r\nsanctioned by him, he will be ready to allow it to be carried into\r\neffect in the course of the year, provided that the financial position\r\npermits.\" It was rather unfortunate that hopes should be so prematurely\r\nraised, and it would surely have been wiser to consult the local\r\nGovernments before than after such a pronouncement. For when they were\r\nconsulted their replies, especially as to the abolition of fees, were\r\nmostly unfavourable, and this year also Government, whilst expressing\r\nits good will, felt bound to defer any decision until the question had\r\nbeen more fully studied and the financial situation had improved.\r\n\r\nThe present situation is certainly unsatisfactory. In 1882 there were\r\n85,000 primary schools in India recognized by the Educational Department\r\nwhich gave elementary education to about 2,000,000 pupils. In 1907,\r\naccording to the last quinquennial report, the total attendance had\r\nincreased to 3,631,000; but though the increase appears very\r\nconsiderable, the Director-General of Education had to admit that,\r\nassuming progress to be maintained at the present rate, \"several\r\ngenerations would still elapse before all the boys of school age were in\r\nschool.\" And Mr. Gokhale's resolution applies, at least ultimately, to\r\ngirls as well as to boys! Now in British India--i.e., without counting\r\nthe Native States--the total number of boys of school-going age on the\r\nbasis of the four years' course proposed for India would be nearly 12\r\nmillions, and there must be about an equal number of girls. The total\r\ncost to the State according to the estimates of local Governments would\r\nbe no less than £15,000,000 per annum, whilst non-recurring expenditure\r\nwould amount to £18,000,000. The fees at present paid by parents for\r\nprimary education, which is already free in some parts of India and in\r\ncertain circumstances, make up only about £210,000 per annum. The whole\r\nof the enormous difference would, therefore, be thrown upon the Indian\r\ntaxpayers, who now have to find for primary education less than £650,000\r\nper annum. Even Mr. Gokhale does not, of course, propose that this\r\neducational and financial revolution should be effected by a stroke of\r\nthe pen, and one of his Hindu colleagues held that, it would be contrary\r\nto all Hindu traditions for parents to avail themselves of free\r\neducation if they could afford to pay a reasonable sum for it.\r\n\r\nBut even if the state of Indian finances were likely within any\r\nappreciable time to warrant an approximate approach to such vast\r\nexpenditure, or if Government could entertain the suggestions made by\r\nMr. Gokhale for meeting it, partly by raising the import duties from 5\r\nto 7-1/2 per cent, and imposing other taxes, and partly by wholesale\r\nretrenchment in other departments, the financial difficulty is not the\r\nonly one to be overcome. Model schoolhouses could no doubt be built all\r\nover India, if the money were forthcoming, instead of the wretched\r\naccommodation which exists now, and is so inadequate that in the Bombay\r\nPresidency alone there are said to be 100,000 boys for whom parents\r\nwant, but cannot obtain, primary education. But what of the teachers?\r\nThese cannot be improvised, however many millions Government may be\r\nprepared to spend. There is an even greater deficiency of good teachers\r\nthan of good schoolhouses, and, in some respects, the value of primary\r\neducation still more than that of secondary education depends upon good\r\nteachers--teachers who are capable of explaining what they teach and not\r\nmerely of reeling off by rote, and imperfectly, to their pupils lessons\r\nwhich they themselves imperfectly understand. The total number of\r\nteachers engaged in primary education exceeds 100,000, but their\r\nsalaries barely average Rs.8 (10s. 8d.) a month. So miserable a pittance\r\nabundantly explains their inefficiency. But there it is, and a new army\r\nof teachers--nearly half a million altogether--would have to be trained\r\nbefore primary education, whether free and compulsory, as Mr. Gokhale\r\nwould have it, or optional and for payment, as others propose, could be\r\nusefully placed within the reach of the millions of Indian children of a\r\nschool-going age.\r\n\r\nIn this as in all other matters, the Government of India cannot afford\r\nto stand still, and will have to take Indian opinion more and more into\r\naccount. But whilst there is a very general consensus that more should\r\nbe done by the State for primary education, there is no unanimity as to\r\nits being made free and compulsory. Various Indian members of Council\r\nhave expressed themselves against it on different grounds. Some contend\r\nthat many parents cannot afford, as bread-winners, to be deprived of the\r\nhelp of their children. According to others, there is already much\r\ncomplaint amongst parents that school-going boys do not make good\r\nagriculturists and affect to consider work in the fields as beneath\r\ntheir dignity. Others, again, ask, and with some reason, who is going to\r\ncare for boys of that age who may have to leave their homes and be\r\nremoved from parental control in order to attend school. There is,\r\ndoubtless, something in all these objections. Assuming that Government\r\ncan do more than it has hitherto done to further primary education, the\r\nwisest course would be to improve the quality rather than the quantity,\r\nand, most of all, the quality of the teachers. Here, again, uniformity\r\nshould be avoided rather than ensued. No primary curriculum can be\r\nevolved which will meet the needs alike of the rural population and of\r\nthe townsfolk, or of the different parts of India with their varying\r\nconditions of climate and temperament. Even more than with regard to\r\nsecondary schools, the needs of parents must be consulted, and the\r\ngreatest latitude given to provincial Governments to vary the system in\r\na practical spirit and in accordance with local requirements. Nor can\r\nthe opinion, strongly held by many parents, be overlooked that religious\r\ninstruction cannot be safely excluded from the training of such young\r\nchildren. Some of the objects to be kept specially in view have been\r\nwell stated by Mr. Orange, the Director-General of Public Education:--\r\n\r\n   We desire to see, if not in every village, within reach of\r\n   every village, a school, not an exotic, but a village school,\r\n   in which the village itself can take pride, and of which the\r\n   first purpose will be to train up good men and women and good\r\n   citizens; and the second; to impart useful knowledge, not\r\n   forgetting while doing so to train the eye and the hand so\r\n   that the children when they leave school, whether for the\r\n   field or the workshop, will have begun to learn the value of\r\n   accurate observation and to feel the joy of intelligent and\r\n   exact manual work.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly the goal towards which primary education should be\r\ndirected, but it can only be reached by steady and continuous effort\r\nspread over a long term of years. Otherwise we shall discover, again too\r\nlate, that, as in the case of secondary education, most haste is worst\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to deal with the question of female education,\r\neither primary or secondary, for it is so intimately bound up with the\r\npeculiarities of Indian, and especially Hindu, society, that it would be\r\ndifficult for the State to take any vigorous initiative without running\r\na great risk of alarming and alienating native opinion[21]. Owing to\r\nIndian social customs and to the practice of early marriage or at least\r\nof early seclusion, for girls, their education presents immense\r\npractical difficulties which do not exist in the case of boys. Hence the\r\nslow progress it has made. At the last census only eight per thousand\r\nwomen could read and write; and in the whole of India only about half a\r\nmillion girls, or four out of every 100 of a school-going age,--even on\r\nthe basis of a four years' course, are receiving any kind of education.\r\nOf such as do go to school nine out of ten only go to primary schools.\r\nMr. Gokhale himself has abandoned the idea of making primary education\r\ncompulsory for girls as well as for boys. Female education is just one\r\nof the questions upon which Indian opinion must be left to ripen,\r\nGovernment giving, in proportion as it ripens, such assistance as can be\r\nlegitimately expected. It has long engaged the attention of enlightened\r\nIndians, and in some communities, especially amongst the Aryas of the\r\nPunjab, some headway is being made. The Parsees, of course, as in all\r\neducational and philanthropic developments, have always been in the\r\nvan. With the growth of Western education the Indian woman of the higher\r\nclasses cannot indefinitely lag behind, and, if only to make their\r\ndaughters more eligible for marriage, the most conservative Indian\r\nparents will be compelled to educate them, as some have already done, so\r\nthat they shall not be separated from their male partners by an\r\nunfathomable gulf of intellectual inferiority. In Calcutta, in Bombay,\r\nin Madras, and indeed in all the principal cities of India, one may\r\nalready meet native ladies, both Hindu and Mahomedan, of education and\r\nrefinement, who, however few their numbers, are shining examples of what\r\nIndian womanhood can rise to when once it is emancipated from the\r\ntrammels of antiquated custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nSWADESHI AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas it not Talleyrand who said that speech had been given to man in\r\norder to enable him to disguise his thoughts? Indian politicians are no\r\nTalleyrands, but they sometimes seem to have framed their vocabulary on\r\npurpose to disguise political conceptions which most of them for various\r\nreasons shrink from defining at present with decision. We have already\r\nseen how elastic is the word _Swaraj_, self-government, or rather\r\nself-rule. In the mouth of the \"moderates\" of the Indian National\r\nCongress it means, we are assured, only a pious aspiration towards the\r\nsame position which our self-governing Colonies enjoy within the Empire.\r\nFor the \"advanced\" politician _Swaraj_ means a transition stage which he\r\nhopes and believes must infallibly lead to a complete severance of the\r\nties that unite India to the Empire. For the \"extremists\" it means the\r\nimmediate and violent emancipation of India from British rule, and\r\nabsolute independence. So it is with the term _Swadeshi_, which means\r\nanything from the perfectly legitimate and commendable encouragement of\r\nIndian trade and industry to the complete exclusion of foreign, and\r\nespecially of British, goods by a \"national\" and often forcible\r\n\"boycott\" as part of a political campaign against British rule.\r\n\r\nPolitical _Swadeshi_ bases itself upon a Nationalist legend that a\r\n\"golden age\" prevailed in India before we appeared on the scene, and\r\nthat British rule has deliberately drained India of her wealth. Even if\r\nwe have to, admit that Indian home industries have suffered heavily from\r\nthe old commercial policy of the East India Company and from the\r\nformidable competition of the organized and scientific processes of\r\nBritish industry, this legend hardly deserves to be treated seriously.\r\nThe _reductio ad absurdum_ of the argument has certainly been reached\r\nwhen Mr. Keir Hardie alleges that Indian loans raised in England\r\nconstitute \"a regular soaking drain upon India because the interest is\r\npaid to bondholders in this country [England], and is not therefore\r\nbenefiting the people from whom it is taken.\" I can only commend this\r\nsapient contention to our self-governing Colonies, who have all had\r\nrecourse in turn to British capital for the development of their\r\nresources, and paid interest on their loans to British bondholders\r\nwithout being apparently conscious of any \"soaking drain.\" The supposed\r\n\"drain\" is estimated in various ways, but a common method adopted is to\r\nlay stress upon the excess of exports over imports[22]. Lord Curzon has\r\nrightly pointed out that economically this test is quite fallacious; and\r\nthat in the richest country in the world, America, the value of the\r\nexports exceeds the imports by over £100,000,000 per annum. Home charges\r\nrepresent three-fourths of the \"drain,\" and these may be calculated at\r\nabout £18,000,000 annually. Of this sum, £6,750,000 is paid in interest\r\non railway capital; but the railways are a source of profit, and the\r\npayment comes from the railway passenger. Moreover, in course of time,\r\nthe Indian railways will become, and are becoming, a property of\r\nenormous value to the State. The interest on India's public debt is\r\n£3,000,000, but it has to be remembered how much India has benefited by\r\nexpenditure which has proved reproductive. Sir Bampfylde Fuller has\r\nstated that the lowest estimate of the increase in produce obtained\r\nthrough irrigation works alone is estimated at £30,000,000 annually. In\r\nthe last 50 years the total volume of Indian trade, imports and exports,\r\nhas increased from £40,000,000 to £200,000,000. The remaining items are\r\nroughly, home military charges, £2,000,000; India Office, &c., £250,000;\r\nleave allowances, £750,000; pensions, £4,000,000. A considerable part of\r\nthese pensions represent merely deferred pay. Moreover, unlike some\r\nother countries, e.g., the United States, where £32,000,000 are spent\r\non pensions, mostly unearned, India has had good value, brimming over,\r\nfor her pensions. The private remittances to England, which must be\r\nadded to these sums, are not treated in any other country as an economic\r\nloss. No American economist would so regard the enormous annual sums\r\nremitted by immigrants to Ireland, Italy, and other European countries,\r\nor the vast annual expenditure of American tourists in Europe. Indian\r\nimmigrants remit £400,000 annually to India from the Straits Settlements\r\nand Malay States alone, and considerable sums must be sent from East and\r\nSouth Africa and Ceylon, as well as smaller sums from Mauritius and the\r\nWest Indies. Yet these colonies do not apparently complain about a\r\n\"drain\" to India.\r\n\r\nWhat India is entitled to ask is whether Indian loans have been expended\r\nfor the benefit of the Indian people, and the answer is conclusive.\r\nIndia possesses to-day assets in the shape of railways, irrigation\r\ncanals, and other public works which, as marketable properties,\r\nrepresent more than her total indebtedness, without even taking into\r\naccount the enormous value of the \"unearned increment\" they have\r\nproduced for the benefit of the people of India. If, therefore, we look\r\nat the Government of India for a moment as merely a board of directors\r\nconducting a great development business on behalf of the Indian people,\r\nthey can certainly show an excellent balance-sheet. Let us admit that\r\nsome of the \"home charges\" may be open to discussion, and I shall have a\r\nword or two or say about them later on. But taken altogether they may\r\nfairly be regarded as the not unreasonable cost of administering a\r\nconcern which, if we wished to liquidate it and to retire from business\r\nto-morrow, would leave a handsome surplus to India after paying off the\r\nwhole debt contracted in her name. The case was stated very fairly by\r\nthe late Mr. Ranade, whose teachings all but the most \"advanced\"\r\npoliticians still profess to reverence, when he delivered the inaugural\r\naddress at the first Industrial Conference held just 20 years ago at\r\nPoona:--\r\n\r\n   There are some people who think that as long as we have\r\n   a heavy tribute to pay to England which takes away nearly\r\n   20 crores of our surplus exports, we are doomed, and can\r\n   do nothing to help ourselves. This is, however, hardly a\r\n   fair or manly position to take up. A portion of the burden\r\n   represents interest on moneys advanced to, or invested in,\r\n   our country, and so far from complaining, we have reason\r\n   to be thankful that we have a creditor who supplies our needs\r\n   at such a low rate of interest. Another portion represents\r\n   the value of stores supplied to us, the like of which we cannot\r\n   produce here. The remainder is alleged to be more or less\r\n   necessary for the purpose of administration, defence, and\r\n   payment of pensions, and, though there is good cause for\r\n   complaint that it is not all necessary, we should not forget\r\n   the fact that we are enabled by reason of this British connexion\r\n   to levy an equivalent tribute from China by our opium\r\n   monopoly.\r\n\r\nIf India must now forgo this tribute from China, it is not at any rate\r\nthe fault of the Government of India that the whole cost of the\r\nawakening of the national conscience in England to the iniquity of the\r\nopium traffic is being thrown upon India.\r\n\r\nThe question is not whether we have done well, but whether we might not\r\nhave done better, and whether the economic development of India,\r\nindustrial, commercial, and agricultural, has kept pace with that of the\r\nrest of the world. If the answer in this case is more doubtful, we have\r\nto bear in mind the idiosyncrasies of the Indian people and especially\r\nof the educated classes. Indians have been as a rule disinclined to\r\ninvest their money in commerce or industry or in scientific forms of\r\nagriculture. It is estimated that the hoarded wealth of India amounts,\r\nat a conservative calculation, to £300,000,000, and this probably\r\nrepresents gold alone. The annual absorption of gold by India is very\r\ngreat. Lord Rothschild remarked to the Currency Commission that none of\r\nthe smooth gold bars sent to India ever came back. There is, in\r\naddition, an enormous sum hoarded in silver rupees and silver ornaments.\r\nIt is no uncommon sight, in the cities of Upper India, to see a child\r\nwearing only one ragged, dirty garment, but loaded with massive silver\r\nornaments. Indians who have money and do not merely hoard it prefer to\r\nlend it out, often at usurious rates of interest, to their needy or\r\nthriftless fellow-countrymen. Until quite recently the educated classes\r\nhave held almost entirely aloof from any but the liberal professions.\r\nScience in any form has been rarely taken up by University students, and\r\nfor every B.Sc. the honours lists have shown probably a hundred B.A.'s.\r\nThe Indian National Congress itself, as it represented mainly those\r\nclasses, naturally displayed the same tendencies, and for a long time it\r\ndevoted its energies to so-called political problems rather than to\r\npractical economic questions. Hence the almost complete failure of the\r\nWestern-educated Indian to achieve any marked success in commercial and\r\nindustrial undertakings, and nowhere has that failure been more complete\r\nthan in Bengal, where it would be difficult to quote more than one\r\nreally brilliant exception. Hence also no doubt some of the political\r\nbitterness which those classes display. Within the last few years,\r\nhowever, the politician has realized that, whilst commercial and\r\nindustrial development was steadily expanding and the demand for it was\r\nincreasing on all sides, he was left standing on a barren shore. He has\r\ndone his best, or rather his worst, to convert _Swadeshi_ into a\r\npolitical weapon. His efforts have only been temporarily and partially\r\nsuccessful. But we may rest assured that long after this spurious\r\npolitical _Swadeshi_ has disappeared, the legitimate form of _Swadeshi_\r\nwill endure--the _Swadeshi_ that does not boycott imported goods merely\r\nbecause they come from England, but is bent on stimulating the\r\nproduction in India of articles of the same or of better quality which\r\ncan be sold cheaper, and can, therefore, beat the imported goods in the\r\nIndian markets.\r\n\r\nTo this form of _Swadeshi_ it is undoubtedly the duty and the interest\r\nof the Government of India to respond. We are bound as trustees for the\r\npeople of India to promote Indian trade and industry by all the means in\r\nour power, and we are equally bound to help to open up new fields of\r\nactivity for the young Indians whom our educational system has diverted\r\nfrom the old paths, and who no longer find for their rapidly increasing\r\nnumbers any sufficient outlet in the public services and liberal\r\nprofessions which originally absorbed them. No reforms in our\r\neducational system can be permanently effective unless we check the\r\ngrowth of the intellectual proletariat, which plays so large a part in\r\nIndian unrest, by diverting the energies of young India into new and\r\nhealthier channels. At the same time there can be no better material\r\nantidote to the spread of disaffection than the prosperity which would\r\nattend the expansion of trade and industry and give to increasing\r\nnumbers amongst the Western-educated classes a direct interest in the\r\nmaintenance of law and order. There are amongst those classes too many\r\nwho, having little or nothing to lose, are naturally prone to fish in\r\nthe troubled waters of sedition.\r\n\r\nIn regard to agriculture, which is, and is bound to remain, the greatest\r\nof all Indian industries, for it supports 70, and perhaps 80, per cent,\r\nof the whole population, the Government of India have no reason to be\r\nashamed of their record. Famines can never be banished from a country\r\nwhere vast tracts are entirely dependent upon an extremely uncertain\r\nrainfall, and the population is equally dependent upon the fruits of the\r\nsoil. But besides the scientific organization of famine relief, the\r\npublic works policy of Government has been steadily and chiefly directed\r\nto the reduction of famine areas. Not only has the construction of a\r\ngreat system of railways facilitated the introduction of foodstuffs into\r\nremote famine-stricken districts, but irrigation works, devised on a\r\nscale and with a skill which have made India the premier school of\r\nirrigation for the rest of the world, have added enormously both to the\r\narea of cultivation and to that where cultivation is secured against\r\nfailure of the rainfall. The arid valley of the Indus has been converted\r\ninto a perennial granary, and in the Punjab alone irrigation canals have\r\nalready added 8,000,000 acres of unusual fertility to the land under\r\ntillage, and have given to 5,000,000 acres more the protection against\r\ndrought in years of deficient rainfall which they formerly lacked.\r\nPlantations of tea, coffee, cinchona, &c., and the cultivation of jute\r\nhave added within the last 25 years some £30,000,000 a year to the value\r\nof Indian exports. Jute alone covers the whole of the so-called \"drain.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact, nevertheless, cannot be denied, though it is an unpleasant\r\nadmission, that a large proportion of the immense agricultural\r\npopulation of India have remained miserably poor. Indian, politicians\r\nascribe this poverty to the crushing burden of the land revenue\r\ncollected by Government--a burden which has been shown to work out only\r\nto about 1s. 8d. per acre of crop and is being steadily reduced in\r\nrelation to the gross revenue of the country--but they say nothing about\r\nthe exactions of the native landlord, who has, for instance in Bengal,\r\nmonopolized at the expense of the peasantry almost the whole benefit of\r\nthe Permanent Settlement. Some very significant facts with regard to\r\n_rayatwari_ landlords were brought out in a debate this year in the\r\nLegislative Council of Madras, when Mr. Atkinson, in reply to one of his\r\nHindu colleagues who had been denouncing the Government assessments in\r\ncertain villages, produced an overwhelming array of figures to show\r\nthat in those very villages the rents exacted by native landlords varied\r\nbetween eight and eleven times the amount which they paid to Government.\r\nNor do Indian politicians say much about the native moneylender, who is\r\nfar more responsible than the tax-gatherer for the poverty of the\r\npeasant. Still less do they say about the extravagance of native\r\ncustoms, partly religious and partly social, which makes the peasant an\r\neasy prey to the moneylender, to whom he is too often driven when he has\r\na child to marry or a parent to bury or a Brahman to entertain.\r\nIndebtedness is the great curse of Indian agriculture, and the peasant's\r\nchief necessity is cheap credit obtained on a system that will not cause\r\nhim to sink deeper into the mire. Here again it is not Indian\r\npoliticians, but the British rulers of India who have found a solution,\r\nand it is of such importance and promise that it deserves more than mere\r\npassing mention.\r\n\r\nIt has been found in the adaptation to Indian requirements of the\r\nwell-known Raffeisen system. Sir William Wedderburn was, I believe,\r\nactually the earliest advocate of this movement, but the first practical\r\nexperiments were made in Madras as a result of exhaustive investigation\r\nby Sir Frederick Nicholson and in the United Provinces when Sir Antony\r\n(now Lord) MacDonnell was Lieutenant-Governor, and one of the many\r\nmeasures passed by Lord Curzon for the benefit of the humbler classes in\r\nIndia, with little or no support from the politicians and often in\r\ndespite of their vehement opposition, whilst Nationalist newspapers\r\njeered at \"a scheme for extracting money from wealthy natives in order\r\nthat Government might make a show of benevolence at other people's\r\nexpense,\" was an Act giving legal sanction to the operations of a system\r\nof co-operative banks and credit societies. It found a healthy basis\r\nready made in the Indian village system, and though it would never have\r\nsucceeded without the informing energy and integrity of \"sun-dried\r\nbureaucrats\" and the countenance given to it by Government, it has had\r\nthe cordial support of many capable native gentlemen. It is now only\r\neight years old, but it has begun to spread with amazing rapidity. The\r\nreport of the Calcutta Conference of Registrars last winter showed that\r\nthe number of societies of all kinds had risen from 1,357 in the\r\npreceding year to 2,008, and their aggregate working capital from 44\r\nlakhs to nearly 81 (one lakh or Rs.100,000=£6,666). The new movement is,\r\nof course, still only in its infancy, but it is full of promise. The\r\nmoneylender, who was at first bitterly hostile, is beginning to realize\r\nthat by providing capital for the co-operative banks he can get, on the\r\nwhole, an adequate return with much better security for his money than\r\nin the old days of great gains and, also, great losses. One of the\r\nhealthiest features is that, notwithstanding the great expansion of the\r\nsystem, during the last twelve months, the additional working capital\r\nrequired was mainly provided by private individuals and only a very\r\nsmall amount by Government. Another hopeful feature is that the money\r\nsaved to the peasant by the lower interest he has to pay on his debts\r\npending repayment is now going into modern machinery and improved\r\nmethods of agriculture. The new system appeals most strongly to poor and\r\nheavily indebted villages, and in the Punjab, where the results are\r\nreally remarkable, especially in some of the backward Mahomedan\r\ndistricts, it is hoped, that within a few years nearly half the peasant\r\nindebtedness, estimated at 25 to 30 millions sterling, will have been\r\nwiped off.\r\n\r\nPractical education is, however, as urgently needed for Indian\r\nagriculture as for any other form of Indian industry. The selection of\r\nland and of seeds, the use of suitable manures, an intelligent rotation\r\nof crops, the adoption of better methods and less antiquated implements\r\ncan only be brought about by practical education, and the demand for it\r\nis one that Government will hear put forward with growing insistency by\r\nthe new Councils on which Indian landowners have been wisely granted\r\nthe special representation that the agricultural interests of India so\r\nabundantly deserve.\r\n\r\nIt was the \"sun-dried bureaucrat\" again who in regard to Indian\r\nindustries as well as to Indian agriculture preached and practised sound\r\n_Swadeshi_ before the word had ever been brought into vogue by the\r\nIndian politician. The veteran Sir George Birdwood, Sir George Watt, Sir\r\nEdward Buck, and many others have stood forth for years as the champions\r\nof Indian art and Indian home industries. As far back as 1883, a\r\nResolution was passed by Government expressing its desire \"to give the\r\nutmost encouragement to every effort to substitute for articles now\r\nobtained from Europe articles of _bona fide_ local manufacture or\r\nindigenous origin.\" In 1886, a special Economic Department was created\r\nto keep up the elaborate survey of the economic products of India which\r\nSir George Watt had just completed under State direction. But the most\r\nimportant administrative measure was the creation under Lord Curzon of a\r\nseparate portfolio of Commerce and Industry in the Government of India,\r\nto which a civilian, Sir John Hewett, was appointed with very\r\nconspicuous success. It was also under Lord Curzon that the most\r\nvigorous impulse was given to technical education of which the claims\r\nhad already been advocated by many distinguished Anglo-Indian officials,\r\nsuch as Sir Antony MacDonnell and Sir Auckland Colvin. The results of an\r\nexhaustive inquiry conducted throughout India by a Committee of\r\ncarefully selected officers were embodied in the Educational Resolution\r\nof 1904. Particular stress was laid upon the importance of industrial,\r\ncommercial, and art and craft schools as the preparatory stages of\r\ntechnical education, for which, in its higher forms, provision had\r\nalready been made in such institutions as the engineering colleges at\r\nSibpur, Rurki, Jubbulpore, and Madras, the College of Science at Poona,\r\nand the Technical Institute of Bombay. Until then the record of\r\ntechnical schools had too often resembled the description which Mr.\r\nButler, the new Minister of Education, tersely gave of that of the\r\nLucknow Industrial School--\"a record of inconstant purpose with breaks\r\nof unconcern.\" Not only did the question of technical education receive\r\nmore systematic treatment, but a special assignment of Rs.244,000 a year\r\nwas made in 1905 by the Government of India in aid of the provincial\r\nrevenues for its improvement and extension. It was not, however, until\r\nthe liberality of the late Mr. J.N. Tata and his sons, one of the best\r\nknown Parsee families of Bombay, recently placed a considerable income\r\nfor the purpose at the disposal of Government that steps have been taken\r\nto establish an \"Indian Institute of Science\" worthy of the name, to\r\nwhich the Mysore Government, who have given a site for it in Bangalore,\r\nas well as the Government of India, have promised handsome financial\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nWhilst the encouragement given to Indian technical education has until\r\nquite lately proceeded far more from the British rulers of India than\r\nfrom any native quarter, it has been also until quite lately British\r\ncapital and British enterprise that have contributed mostly to the\r\ndevelopment of Indian industry and commerce. The amount of British\r\ncapital invested in India for its commercial and industrial development\r\nhas been estimated at £350,000,000, and this capital incidentally\r\nfurnishes employment for large numbers of Indians. Half a million are\r\nemployed, on the railways alone. Another half million work on the tea\r\nestates. The Bombay and Ahmedabad cotton mills represent at the present\r\nday the only important and successful application of Indian capital and\r\nIndian enterprise to industrial development. The woollen, cotton, and\r\nleather industries of Cawnpore, which has become one of the chief\r\nmanufacturing centres of India, and the great jute industry of Bengal\r\nwere promoted almost exclusively by British, and not by indigenous\r\neffort. Real _Swadeshi_, stimulated by British teaching and by British\r\nenterprise, was thus already in full swing when the Indian politician\r\ntook up the cry and too often perverted it to criminal purposes, and,\r\nthough he may have helped to rouse his sluggish fellow countrymen to\r\nhealthy as well as to mischievous activity, it may be doubted whether\r\nany good he has done has not been more than counterbalanced by the\r\ninjurious effect upon capital of a violent and often openly seditious\r\nagitation. Mr. Gokhale himself seems to have awakened to this danger,\r\nwhen in an eloquent speech delivered by him at Lucknow, in support of\r\n_Swadeshi_ in 1907, he protested, rather late in the day, against the\r\n\"narrow, exclusive, and intolerant spirit\" in which some advocates of\r\nthe cause were seeking to promote it, and laid stress upon the\r\nimportance of capital as well as of enterprise and skill as an\r\nindispensable factor of success. British investments are large, but not\r\nso large as they might and should be, and the reluctance to invest in\r\nIndia grows with the uneasiness caused by political unrest.\r\n\r\nThat an immense field lies open in India for industrial development need\r\nscarcely be argued. It has been explored with great knowledge and\r\nability in a very instructive article contributed last January to the\r\n_Asiatic Quarterly Review_ by Mr. A.C. Chatterjee, an Indian member of\r\nthe Civil Service. Amongst the many instances he gives of industries\r\nclamouring for the benefits of applied science, I will quote only the\r\ntreatment of oil seeds, the manufacture of paper from wood pulp and wood\r\nmeal, the development of leather factories and tanneries, as well as of\r\nboth vegetable and chemical dyes, the sugar industry, and metal\r\nwork--all of which, if properly instructed and directed, would enable\r\nIndia to convert her own raw materials with profit into finished\r\nproducts either for home consumption or for exportation abroad. It is at\r\nleast equally important for India to save her home industries, and\r\nespecially her hand-weaving industry, the wholesale destruction of\r\nwhich under the pressure of the Lancashire power loom has thrown so\r\nmany poor people on to the already over-crowded land. Here, as Mr.\r\nChatterjee wisely remarks, combination and organization are badly\r\nneeded, for \"the hand industry has the greatest chances of survival when\r\nit adopts the methods of the power industry without actual resort to\r\npower machinery.\" The articles on the Indian industrial problem in\r\n_Science Progress_ for April and July, by Mr. Alfred Chatterton,\r\nDirector of Industries, Madras, are also worth careful attention. He\r\nremarks quite truly that her inexhaustible supplies of cheap labour are\r\n\"India's greatest asset\"; but he too wisely holds that the factory\r\nsystem of the West should only be guardedly extended and under careful\r\nprecautions. The Government of India have at present under consideration\r\nimportant legislative measures for preventing the undue exploitation of\r\nboth child and adult labour--measures which are already being denounced\r\nby the native Press as \"restrictive\" legislation devised by the \"English\r\ncotton kings\" in order to \"stifle the indigenous industries of India in\r\ntheir infancy\"!\r\n\r\nWhat Government can do for the pioneering of new industries is shown by\r\nthe success of the State dairies in Northern India and of Mr.\r\nChatterton's experiments in the manufacturing of aluminium in Madras.\r\nThere is an urgent demand at present for industrial research\r\nlaboratories and experimental work all over India, and above all for\r\nbetter and more practical education. But it would seem that, in this\r\ndirection, the impetus given by Lord Curzon has somewhat slackened under\r\nLord Minto's administration, owing, doubtless, to the absorbing claims\r\nof the political situation and of political reforms.\r\n\r\nIn speaking in the Calcutta Council on a resolution for the\r\nestablishment of a great Polytechnic College, the Home Member was able\r\nto point to a fairly long list of measures taken at no small cost by the\r\nState to promote technical education in all parts of India, and he\r\nrightly urged that there would be little use in creating a sort of\r\ntechnical University until a larger proportion of students had qualified\r\nfor it by taking advantage of the more elementary courses already\r\nprovided for them. His answer would, however, have been more convincing\r\ncould he have shown that existing institutions are always adequately\r\nequipped and that considered schemes which have the support of the best\r\nIndian as well as of the best official opinion are not subjected to\r\nmerely dilatory objections at headquarters. Three years ago, after the\r\nNaini Tal Industrial Conference, the most representative ever perhaps\r\nheld in India, Sir John Hewett, who had been made Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nthe United Provinces after having been the first to hold the new\r\nportfolio of Commerce and Industry, developed a scheme for the creation\r\nof a Technological College at Cawnpore, which met with unanimous\r\napproval. Nothing has yet been done to give effect to it, and it was not\r\nonly the Indian but many of the European members, official as well as\r\nunofficial, of the Viceroy's Legislative Council who sympathized with\r\nMr. Mudholkar's protest when he asked with some bitterness what must be\r\nthe impression produced in India by the shelving of a scheme that was\r\nsupported by men of local experiences by the head of the Provincial\r\nGovernment, and by the Government of India, because people living 6,000\r\nmiles away did not consider it to be absolutely flawless.\r\n\r\nIn one direction at any rate, India can rightly demand that Government\r\nshould be left an entirely free hand--namely, in regard to the very\r\nlarge orders which have to be placed every year by the great spending\r\ndepartments. It has now been laid down by the Secretary of State that\r\nIndian industry should supply the needs of Government in respect of all\r\narticles that are, in whole or in part, locally manufactured. But Indian\r\nindustry would be able to supply much more if the Government of India\r\nwere in a position to give it more assured support. The case of the\r\nBengal Iron and Steel Company has been quoted to me, which was\r\ncompelled to close down its steel works and to reduce the number of its\r\niron furnaces in blast from four to two because the promises of support\r\nreceived from Government when the company took over the works proved to\r\nbe largely and quite inexcusably illusory. For works of this kind cannot\r\nbe run at present in India unless they can depend upon the hearty\r\nsupport of Government, which, through the Railways and Public Works\r\nDepartment, is the main, and, indeed, the only, consumer on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, Messrs. Tata are making a truly gigantic\r\nendeavour to acclimatize the iron and steel industry in India by the\r\nerection of immense works at Sakti in Bengal, where they have within\r\neasy reach a practically unlimited supply of the four necessary raw\r\nmaterials iron ore, coking coal, flux, and manganese ore. To utilize\r\nthese, plant is being set up of a yearly capacity of 120,000 tons of\r\nfoundry iron, rails, shapes, and merchant bars, and plans have been\r\ndrawn out for an industrial city of 20,000 inhabitants. The enterprise\r\nis entirely in Indian hands with an initial share capital of £1,545,000\r\nadministered by an Indian board of directors, who have engaged American\r\nexperts to organize the works. Government has granted various railway\r\nfacilities to the company and has placed with them an order for 200,000\r\ntons of rails for periodical delivery. Upon the future of these works\r\nwill probably depend for many years to come the success of the\r\nmetallurgical and other kindred industries of India, and it is to be\r\nhoped that Government will be allowed to give them all reasonable\r\nassistance without interference from home. Another purely Indian\r\nenterprise--also under the auspices of Messrs. Tata--is a great scheme\r\nfor catching the rainfall of the Western Ghats and creating a\r\nhydro-electric supply of power which will, amongst other uses, drive\r\nmost of the Bombay mills.\r\n\r\nIn regard to minor Indian industries, hints have, I am assured, too\r\nfrequently been sent out from England that the claims of British\r\nindustry to Government support must not be forgotten. Even now no change\r\nhas been made in the regulations which compel the Government of India to\r\npurchase all articles not wholly or partly manufactured in India through\r\nthe Stores Department of the India Office. The delay thus caused in\r\nitself represents a serious loss, for it appears to take an average of\r\nnine months for any order through that Department to be carried out, and\r\nfurther delays arise whenever some modification in the original indent\r\nis required. Nowadays merchants in India keep for ordinary purposes of\r\ntrade such large collections of samples that in nine cases out of ten\r\nGovernment Departments could settle at once upon what they want and\r\ntheir orders would be carried out both more quickly and more cheaply.\r\nThe maintenance of these antiquated regulations, which are very\r\ninjurious to Indian trade, is attributed by Indians mainly to the\r\ninfluence of powerful vested interests in England.\r\n\r\nThe time would also seem to, have arrived when, with the development of\r\nIndian trade and industry, private contracts might with advantage be\r\nsubstituted for the more expensive and slower activities of the Public\r\nWorks Department. Work done by that Department is bound to be more\r\nexpensive, for its enormous establishment has to be maintained on the\r\nsame footing whether financial conditions allow or do not allow\r\nGovernment to embark on large public works expenditure, and when they do\r\nnot, the proportion of establishment charges to the actual cost of works\r\nis ruinous. When the Calcutta Port Trust and other institutions of the\r\nsame character put out to contract immense works running every year into\r\nmillions, why, it is asked, should not Government do the same? Some\r\nworks like irrigation works may properly be reserved for the Public\r\nWorks Department, but to mobilize the Department whenever a bungalow has\r\nto be built or a road made by Government, is surely ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIndian opinion is at present just in the mood when reasonable\r\nconcessions of this kind would make an excellent impression; and, if\r\nthey are not made spontaneously, the enlarged Indian Councils will soon\r\nexert pressure to obtain them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCIAL AND FISCAL RELATIONS BETWEEN INDIA AND GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Morley introduced his Indian reforms scheme, a section at\r\nleast of the party to which he belongs supported it not only on general\r\ngrounds, but more especially in the belief that it would strengthen the\r\nhands of the Imperial Government in dealing with the hide-bound\r\nofficialism of which the Government of India is in the eyes of some\r\nBritish Radicals the visible embodiment. None of them, probably,\r\nanticipated that the boot would be on the other leg. If the Government\r\nof India have sometimes sacrificed Indian interests to British\r\ninterests, it has been almost exclusively in connexion with the\r\nfinancial and fiscal relations between the two countries, and often\r\nagainst the better judgment and sense of justice of Anglo-Indian\r\nofficials. In this respect the enlarged Indian Councils will lend far\r\ngreater weight than in the past to any representations which the\r\nGovernment of India may make at Whitehall.\r\n\r\nEven in the course of its first session at Calcutta the Imperial Council\r\nhas given abundant indications of its attitude. In the Budget debate,\r\nSir Vithaldas Thackersey, one of the Indian elected members from Bombay,\r\nremarked very pointedly that \"there is an impression abroad that, in\r\ndeciding most important questions of economic and financial policy, the\r\nGovernment are obliged to be guided by political exigencies.\" Official\r\nsecrets have a way of leaking out in India, and Sir Vithaldas knew what\r\nhe was talking about when he added with regard to the Budget under\r\ndiscussion--\"It is generally believed that, if the Government of India\r\nhad had a freer hand, they would have preferred the raising of the\r\ngeneral tariff or a duty on sugar, which would have been less\r\nobjectionable than the levying of the proposed enhanced duties in the\r\nteeth of the practically unanimous opposition of the non-official\r\nmembers of this Council and of the public generally\".\r\n\r\nIt is certainly unfortunate that on the first occasion on which the\r\nGovernment of India had to lay a financial statement before the enlarged\r\nCouncil, Indian members should have come to the conclusion that the\r\nunpopular Budget submitted to them was not the one originally proposed\r\nby the Indian Finance Department, but that it had been imposed upon that\r\nDepartment by the Secretary of State in deference to the exigencies of\r\nBritish party politics. Equally unfortunate is it that the financial\r\ndifficulties which this Budget had to meet were mainly due to the loss\r\nof revenue on opium in consequence of the arrangements made by Great\r\nBritain with China, in which Indian interests had received very scant\r\nconsideration. Not only had Sir Edward Baker, when he was Finance\r\nMinister three years ago, given an assurance that the new opium policy\r\nwould be carried out without any resort to extra taxation, but there is\r\na strong feeling in India that the praiseworthy motives which have\r\ninduced the Imperial Government to come to terms with China on the\r\nsubject of the opium trade would be still more creditable to the British\r\npeople had not the Indian taxpayer been left, with his fellow-sufferers\r\nin Hong-Kong and Singapore, to bear the whole cost of British moral\r\nrectitude. The Imperial Council did not confine itself, either, to\r\ncriticism of what had happened. Sir Vithaldas Thackersey had probably\r\nevery Indian and many official members with him when he made the\r\nfollowing very clear intimation as to the future:--\"We are prepared to\r\nbear our burdens, and all that we ask is that the country should be\r\nallowed greater freedom in choosing the methods of raising revenue. I am\r\nunable to see how it will be injurious to the interests of Government if\r\nthis Council is allowed a more real share as regards what articles shall\r\nbe taxed and what duties shall be paid.\"\r\n\r\nIt is upon such questions as these that the voice of the enlarged\r\nCouncils will in future cause much more frequent embarrassment to the\r\nImperial Government than to the Government of India, and I shall be much\r\nsurprised if they have not to listen to it in regard to various \"home\r\ncharges\" with which the Government of India have from time to time very\r\nreluctantly agreed to burden Indian finance at the bidding of Whitehall.\r\nThe Indian Nationalist Press has not been alone in describing the recent\r\nimposition on the Indian taxpayer of a capitation allowance amounting to\r\n£300,000 a year to meet the increased cost of the British soldier as\r\n\"the renewed attempt of a rapacious War Office to raid the helpless\r\nIndian Treasury,\" and even the increase in the pay of the native\r\nsoldier, which Lord Kitchener obtained for him, does not prevent him and\r\nhis friends from drawing their own comparison between the squalor of the\r\nquarters in which he is still housed and the relatively luxurious\r\nbarracks built for Tommy Atkins under Lord Kitchener's administration at\r\nthe expense of the Indian taxpayer. It is no secret that the Government\r\nof India have also frequently remonstrated in vain when India has been\r\ncharged full measure and overflowing in respect of military operations\r\nin which the part borne by her has been governed less by her own direct\r\ninterests than by the necessity of making up with the help of Indian\r\ncontingents the deficiencies of our military organization at home. It\r\nwas no Indian politician but the Government of India who expressed the\r\nopinion that:--\r\n\r\n   The Imperial Government keeps in India and quarters\r\n   upon the revenues of that country as large a portion of its\r\n   army as it thinks can possibly be required to maintain its\r\n   dominion there; that it habitually treats that army as a\r\n   reserve force available for Imperial purposes; that it has\r\n   uniformly detached European regiments from the garrison\r\n   of India to take part in Imperial wars whenever it has been\r\n   found necessary or convenient to do so; and, more than this,\r\n   that it has drawn not less freely upon the native army of\r\n   India, towards the maintenance of which it contributes\r\n   nothing, to aid in contests outside of India with which the\r\n   Indian Government has had little or no concern.\r\n\r\nAll these are, however, but secondary issues to the much larger one\r\nwhich the creation of the new Councils must tend to bring to the front\r\nwith all the force of the increased weight given to them by the recent\r\nreforms. For that issue will raise the whole principle of our fiscal\r\nrelations with India, if it results in a demand for the protection of\r\nIndian industries against the competition of imported manufactures by an\r\nautonomous tariff. It must be remembered that the desire for Protection\r\nis no new thing in India. Whether we like it or not, whether we be Free\r\nTraders or Tariff Reformers, we have to reckon with the fact that almost\r\nevery Indian is a Protectionist at heart, whatever he may be in theory.\r\nThe Indian National Congress has hitherto fought shy of making\r\nProtection a prominent plank of its platform, lest it should offend its\r\npolitical friends in England. Yet as far back as 1902 a politician as\r\ncareful as Mr. Surendranath Banerjee to avoid in his public utterances\r\nanything that might alienate British Radicalism, declared in his\r\ninaugural address at the 18th session of the Congress that \"if we had a\r\npotential voice in the government of our own country there would be no\r\nquestion as to what policy we should follow. We would unhesitatingly\r\nadopt a policy of Protection.\" This note has been accentuated since the\r\npolitical campaign in favour of militant Swadeshism, and when English\r\nRadicals sympathize with the _Swadeshi_ boycott as a protest against\r\nthe Partition of Bengal, they would do well to recollect that, before\r\nIndian audiences, the most violent forms of _Swadeshi_ are constantly\r\ndefended on the ground that British industrial greed, of which Free\r\nTrade is alleged to be the highest expression, has left no other weapons\r\nto India for the defence of her material interests. Mr. Lala Lajpat Rai,\r\nwho has the merit of often speaking with great frankness, addressed\r\nhimself once in the following terms to \"those estimable gentlemen in\r\nIndia who believe in the righteousness of the British nation as\r\nrepresented by the electors of Great Britain and Ireland, and who are\r\nafraid of offending them by the boycott of English-made goods\":\r\n\r\n   If there are any two classes into which the British nation\r\n   can roughly be divided they are either manufacturers or\r\n   the working men. Both are interested in keeping the Indian\r\n   market open for the sale and consumption of their manufactures.\r\n   They are said to be the only friends to whom we\r\n   can appeal against the injustice of the Anglo-Indian bureaucracy.\r\n   Offend them, we are told, and you are undone. You\r\n   lose the good will of the only classes who can help you and\r\n   who are prepared to listen to your grievances. But, boycott\r\n   or no boycott, any movement calculated to increase the manufacturing\r\n   power of India is likely to incur the displeasure\r\n   of the British elector. He is a very well-educated animal,\r\n   a keen man of business, who can at once see through things\r\n   likely to affect his pocket, however cleverly they may be\r\n   put or arranged by those who hold an interest which is really\r\n   adverse to his. He is not likely to be hoodwinked by the\r\n   cry of _Swadeshi_ minus the boycott, because, really speaking,\r\n   if effectively worked and organized, both are one and the\r\n   same thing.\r\n\r\nThat _Swadeshi_ as understood by educated Indians of all classes and of\r\nall political complexions means in some form or other Protection was\r\nmade clear even in the Imperial Council. The Finance Member, Sir\r\nFleetwood Wilson, was himself fain to pay homage to it, but his sympathy\r\ndid not disarm Mr. Chitnavis, an Indian member whose speech deserves to\r\nbe recorded, as it embodied the opinions entertained by 99 out of every\r\n1,000 Indians who are interested in economic questions and by a very\r\nlarge number of Anglo-Indians, both official and non-official:--\r\n\r\n   The country must be grateful to him [the Finance Member]\r\n   for his sympathetic attitude towards Indian industries.\r\n   \"I think _Swadeshi_ is good, and if the outcome of the changes\r\n   I have laid before the Council result in some encouragement\r\n   of Indian industries, I for one shall not regret it.\" For a\r\n   Finance Minister to say even so much is not a small thing\r\n   in the present state of India's dependence upon the most\r\n   pronounced and determined Free Trade country in the\r\n   world.... At the same time we regret the absence\r\n   of fiscal autonomy for India and the limitations under which\r\n   this Government has to frame its industrial policy. We\r\n   regret that Government cannot give the country a protective\r\n   tariff forthwith. However excellent Free Trade may be for\r\n   a country in an advanced stage of industrial development,\r\n   it must be conceded that Protection is necessary for the\r\n   success and development of infant industries. Even pronounced\r\n   protagonists of Free Trade do not view this idea\r\n   with disfavour. That Indian manufacturing industry is\r\n   in its infancy does not admit of controversy. Why should\r\n   not India, then, claim special protection for her undeveloped\r\n   industry? Even countries remarkable for their industrial\r\n   enterprise and excellence protect their industries. The\r\n   United States and Germany are decidedly Protectionist. The\r\n   British Colonies have protective tariffs... protective\r\n   in purpose, scope, and effect. They are not like the Indian\r\n   import duties, levied for revenue purposes. The Indian\r\n   appeal for Protection cannot in the circumstances be unreasonable.\r\n   The development of the industries is a matter\r\n   of great moment to the Empire, and the popular leanings\r\n   towards Protectionism ought to engage the sympathy of\r\n   Government. The imposition of import duties for revenue\r\n   purposes is sanctioned by precedent and principle alike.\r\n   ... And yet for a small import duty of 3-1/2 per cent,\r\n   upon cotton goods a countervailing Excise duty upon home\r\n   manufactures is imposed in disregard of Indian public opinion,\r\n   and the latest pronouncement of the Secretary of State has\r\n   dispelled all expectations of the righting of this wrong.\r\n\r\nNo measure has done greater injury to the cause of Free Trade in India\r\nor more permanent discredit to British rule than this Excise duty on\r\nIndian manufactured cotton, for none has done more to undermine Indian\r\nfaith in the principles of justice upon which British rule claims, and,\r\non the whole, most legitimately claims, to be based. In obedience to\r\nBritish Free Trade principles, all import duties were finally abolished\r\nin India at the beginning of the eighties, except on liquors and on\r\nsalt, which were subject to an internal Excise duty. In 1894, however,\r\nthe Government of India were compelled by financial stress to revive the\r\ngreater part of the old 5 per cent tariff on imports, excluding cottons,\r\nuntil the end of the year when cottons were included and under pressure\r\nfrom England. Lord Elgin's Government had to agree to levy a\r\ncountervailing Excise duty of 5 per cent on cotton fabrics manufactured\r\nin Indian power mills. After a good deal of heated correspondence the\r\nGovernment of India were induced in February, 1896, to reduce the duty\r\non cotton manufactured goods imported from abroad to 3-1/2 per cent., with\r\nthe same reduction of the Indian Excise duty, whilst cotton yarns were\r\naltogether freed from duty. This arrangement is still in force.\r\n\r\nRightly or wrongly, every Indian believes that the Excise duty was\r\nimposed upon India for the selfish benefit of the British cotton\r\nmanufacturer and under the pressure of British party politics. He\r\nbelieves, as was once sarcastically remarked by an Indian member of the\r\nViceroy's Legislative Council, that, so long as Lancashire sends 60\r\nmembers to Westminster, the British Government will always have 60\r\nreasons for maintaining the Excise duty. To the English argument that\r\nthe duty is \"only a small one\" the Indian reply is that, according to\r\nthe results of an elaborate statistical inquiry conducted at the\r\ninstance of the late Mr. Jamsetjee N. Tata, a 3-1/2 per cent Excise duty on\r\ncotton cloth is equivalent to a 7 per cent duty on capital invested in\r\nweaving under Indian conditions. The profits are very fluctuating and\r\nthe depreciation of plant is considerable. Equally fallacious is\r\nanother argument that the duty is in reality paid by Englishmen. The\r\ncapital engaged in the Indian cotton industry is, it is contended, not\r\nBritish, but almost exclusively Indian, and a large proportion is held\r\nby not over-affluent Indian shareholders.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to choose between the records of the two great\r\npolitical parties at home in their treatment of England's financial and\r\nfiscal relations with India, and English Tariff Reformers have as a rule\r\nshown little more disposition than English Free Traders to study Indian\r\ninterests. In fact, until Mr. M. de P. Webb, a member of the Bombay\r\nLegislative Council, published under the title of \"India and the Empire\"\r\nan able exposition of the Tariff problem in relation to India, very few\r\nTariff Reformers seemed even to take India into account in their schemes\r\nof Imperial preference. I hope, therefore, to be absolved from all\r\nsuspicion of party bias in drawing attention to a question which is, I\r\nbelieve, destined to play in the near future a most important--perhaps\r\neven a determining--part in the relations of India to the British\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things that struck me on my return to India this\r\nyear--and struck me most forcibly--was the universality and vehemence of\r\nthe demand for a new economic policy directed with energy and system to\r\nthe expansion of Indian trade and industry. It is a demand with which\r\nthe great majority of Anglo-Indian officials are in full sympathy, and\r\nit is in fact largely the outcome of their own efforts to stimulate\r\nIndian interest in the question. There is very little doubt that the\r\nGovernment of India would be disposed to respond to it speedily and\r\nheartily on the lines I have already briefly indicated. Will the\r\nImperial Government and the British democracy lend them a helping hand\r\nor even leave a free hand to them? If not, we shall assuredly find\r\nourselves confronted with an equally universal and vehement demand for\r\nProtection pure and simple by the erection of an Indian Tariff wall\r\nagainst the competition of imported manufactures. I need hardly point\r\nout how the rejection of such a demand would be exploited by the\r\npolitical agitator or how it would rally to the side of active\r\ndisaffection some of the most conservative and influential classes in\r\nIndia. For if, as those Englishmen who claim a monopoly of sympathy with\r\nthe people of India are continually preaching, we must be prepared to\r\nsacrifice administrative efficiency to sympathy, how could we shelter\r\nourselves on an economic issue behind theories of the greater economic\r\nefficiency of Free Trade? If we are to try \"to govern India in\r\naccordance with Indian ideas\"--a principle with which I humbly but fully\r\nagree--how could we justify the refusal to India, of the fiscal autonomy\r\nfor which there is a far more widespread and genuine demand than for\r\npolitical autonomy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION OF INDIANS IN THE EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problems of Indian administration are in themselves difficult enough\r\nto solve, but even more difficult are some of the problems connected\r\nwith the relations of India and her peoples to the rest of the Empire.\r\nOne of these has assumed during the last few years a character of\r\nextreme gravity, which neither the Imperial Government nor the British\r\npublic seems to have at all adequately grasped.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said Mr. Gokhale in moving his resolution for the prohibition\r\nof Indian indentured labour for Natal, \"I am stating the plain truth\r\nwhen I say that no single question of our time has evoked more bitter\r\nfeelings throughout India--feelings in the presence of which the best\r\nfriends of British rule have had to remain helpless--than the continued\r\nill-treatment of Indians in South Africa.\"\r\n\r\nEvery Indian member of the Viceroy's Legislative Council who spoke\r\nduring that debate, whatever race or creed or caste he represented,\r\nendorsed the truth of Mr. Gokhale's statement, and had a vote been taken\r\non the resolution it would have had what no other resolution moved\r\nduring the whole session would have secured--the unanimous support of\r\nthe whole body of Indian members and the sympathy of every English\r\nmember, official as well as unofficial. The Government of India wisely\r\naverted a division by accepting the resolution. Not a single attempt was\r\nmade either by the Viceroy in the chair or by other representatives of\r\nGovernment to controvert either Mr. Gokhale's statement or the\r\noverwhelming array of facts showing the nature and extent of the\r\nill-treatment of Indians in South Africa, which was presented by the\r\nmover of the resolution and by every Indian speaker who followed him.\r\nThe whole tone of the debate was extremely dignified and\r\nself-restrained, but no Englishman can have listened to it without a\r\ndeep sense of humiliation. For the first time in history the Government\r\nof India had to sit dumb whilst judgment was pronounced in default\r\nagainst the Imperial Government upon a question which has stirred the\r\nresentment of every single community of our Indian Empire. It was the\r\none question which called forth very deep feeling in the Indian National\r\nCongress at Lahore last December, where subscriptions and donations\r\nflowed in freely to defray the expenses of a campaign throughout India,\r\nand it figured just as prominently in the proceedings of the All-India\r\nMoslem League, which held its annual meeting there in the following\r\nmonth. In fact, Mahomedans have the additional grievance that the laws\r\nof the Transvaal discriminate by name against those of their faith.\r\nThere is scarcely a city of any importance in India in which public\r\nmeetings have not testified to the interest and indignation which the\r\nsubject arouses in every class of Indian audience.\r\n\r\nThis is a very grave fact. I need not enter into the details of the\r\nquestion. They are well known. There may be some exaggerations, Indian\r\nimmigrants may not always be drawn from desirable classes, there may be\r\ndifferences of opinion as to the wisdom of the attitude taken up by some\r\nof the Indians in South Africa, and Englishmen may sympathize with the\r\ndesire of British and Dutch colonists to check the growth of another\r\nalien population in their midst. But that the Indian has not received\r\nthere the just treatment to which he is entitled as a subject of the\r\nBritish Crown, and that disabilities and indignities are heaped upon him\r\nbecause he is an Indian, are broad facts that are not and cannot be\r\ndisputed. The resolution adopted by the Imperial Council, with the\r\nsanction of the Government of India, was formally directed against Natal\r\nbecause it is only in regard to Natal that India possesses an effective\r\nweapon of retaliation in withholding the supply of indentured labour\r\nwhich is indispensable to the prosperity of that colony. But the Indian\r\ngrievance is not confined to Natal; it is even greater in the Transvaal.\r\nStill less is it confined to the particular class of Indians who\r\nemigrate as indentured labourers to South Africa. What Indians feel most\r\nbitterly is that however well educated, however respectable and even\r\ndistinguished may be an Indian who goes to or resides in South Africa,\r\nand especially in the Transvaal, he is treated as an outcast and is at\r\nthe mercy of harsh laws and regulations framed for his oppression, and\r\noften interpreted with extra harshness by the officials who are left to\r\napply them. This bitterness is intensified by the recollection that,\r\nbefore the South African War, the wrongs of British Indians in the\r\nTransvaal figured prominently in the catalogue of charges brought by the\r\nImperial Government against the Kruger _régime_ and contributed not a\r\nlittle to precipitate its downfall. In prosecuting the South African War\r\nGreat Britain drew freely upon India for assistance of every kind except\r\nactual Indian combatants. Not only was it the loyalty of India that\r\nenabled the British troops who saved Natal to be embarked hurriedly at\r\nBombay, but it was the constant supply from India of stores of all\r\nkinds, of transport columns, of hospital bearers, &c., which, to a great\r\nextent, made up throughout the war for the deficiencies of the British\r\nWar Office. There are monuments erected in South Africa which testify to\r\nthe devotion of British Indians who, though non-combatants, laid down\r\ntheir lives in the cause of the Empire. Yet, as far as the British\r\nIndians are concerned, the end of it all has been that their lot in the\r\nTransvaal since it became a British Colony is harder than it was In the\r\nold Kruger days, and the British colonists in the Transvaal, who were\r\nready enough to use Indian grievances as a stick with which to beat\r\nKrugerism, have now joined hands with the Dutch in refusing to redress\r\nthem. The Government of India have repeatedly urged upon the Imperial\r\nGovernment the gravity of this question, and Lord Curzon especially\r\npressed upon his friends, when they were in office, the vital importance\r\nof effecting some acceptable settlement whilst the Transvaal was still a\r\nCrown Colony, and, therefore, more amenable to the influence of the\r\nMother Country than it would be likely to prove when once endowed with\r\nself-government. Yet the Imperial Government after a succession of\r\nhalf-hearted and ineffective protests have now finally acquiesced in the\r\nperpetuation and even the aggravation of wrongs which some ten years ago\r\nthey solemnly declared to be intolerable.\r\n\r\nApart from the sense of justice upon which Englishmen pride themselves,\r\nit is impossible to overlook the disastrous consequences of this _gran\r\nrifiuto_ for the prestige of British rule in India. One of the Indian\r\nMembers of Council, Mr. Dadabhoy, indicated them in terms as moderate as\r\nthey were significant:--\r\n\r\n   In 1899 Lord Lansdowne feared the moral consequences\r\n   in India of a conviction of the powerlessness of the British\r\n   _Raj_ to save the Indian settlers in the Transvaal from oppression\r\n   and harsh treatment. That was when there was peace all\r\n   over this country, when sedition, much more anarchism,\r\n   was an unheard-of evil. If the situation was disquieting then,\r\n   what is it now when the urgent problem of the moment\r\n   is how to put down and prevent the growth of unrest In the\r\n   land? The masses do not understand the niceties of the\r\n   relations between the Mother Country and the Colonies;\r\n   they do not comprehend the legal technicalities. The British\r\n   _Raj_ has so far revealed itself to them as a power whose influence\r\n   is irresistible, and when they find that, with all its traditional\r\n   omnipotence, it has not succeeded in securing to their countrymen\r\n   --admittedly a peaceable and decent body of settlers who\r\n   rendered valuable services during the war--equal treatment\r\n   at the hands of a small Dependency, they become disheartened\r\n   and attribute the failure to the European colonist's influence\r\n   over the Home Government. That is an impression which is\r\n   fraught with incalculable potentialities of mischief and which\r\n   British statesmanship should do everything in its power\r\n   to dispel. The present political situation in India adds\r\n   special urgency to the case.\r\n\r\nNo comments of mine could add to the significance of this warning.\r\n\r\nThe measure contemplated by Mr. Gokhale's resolution may have some\r\ndirect effect upon Natal, whose leading statesmen have repeatedly\r\nacknowledged the immense value of Indian indentured labour to the\r\nColony, and may indirectly affect public opinion in the Transvaal. But\r\nbehind the immediate question of the worse or better treatment of\r\nIndians in South Africa stand much larger questions, which Mr. Gokhale\r\ndid not hesitate to state with equal frankness:--\r\n\r\n   Behind all the grievances of which I have spoken to-day\r\n   three questions of vital importance emerge to view. First,\r\n   what is the _status_ of us Indians in this Empire? Secondly,\r\n   what is the extent of the responsibility which lies on the\r\n   Imperial Government to ensure to us just and humane and,\r\n   gradually, even equal treatment in this Empire? And,\r\n   thirdly, how far are the self-governing members of this\r\n   Empire bound by its cardinal principles, or are they to share\r\n   in its privileges only and not to bear their share of the disadvantages?\r\n\r\nThese issues have been raised in their most acute form in South Africa,\r\nbut they exist also in Australia, and even in Canada, where many Indians\r\nsuffered heavily from the outburst of anti-Asiatic feeling which swept\r\nalong the Pacific Coast a couple of years ago. They involve the position\r\nof Asiatic subjects of the Crown in all the self-governing Dominions and\r\nindirectly in many of the Crown Colonies, for they affect the relations\r\nof the white and coloured races throughout the Empire. Here, however, I\r\nmust confine myself to the Indian aspects. I have discussed them with a\r\ngood many Indians, and they are quite alive to the difficulties of the\r\nsituation. Though they resent the colour bar, they realize the strength\r\nof the feeling there is in the Colonies in favour of preserving the\r\nwhite race from intermixture with non-white races. It is, in fact, a\r\nfeeling they themselves in some ways share, for, in India the\r\nunfortunate Eurasian meets with even less sympathy from Indians than\r\nfrom Europeans. Indian susceptibilities may even find some consolation\r\nin the fact that Colonial dislike of the Indian immigrant is to a great\r\nextent due to his best qualities. \"Indians,\" said Mr. Mudholkar,\r\nappealing to Lord Minto, \"are hated, as your Lordship's predecessor\r\npointed out, on account of their very virtues. It is because they are\r\nsober, thrifty, industrious, more attentive to their business than the\r\nwhite men that their presence in the Colonies is considered\r\nintolerable.\" Educated Indians know how little hold the Mother Country\r\nhas over her Colonies in these matters. They know that both British and\r\nAnglo-Indian statesmen have recognized their grievances without being\r\nable to secure their redress, and it is interesting to note how warm\r\nwere the tributes paid in the Imperial Council to the energy with which\r\nLord Curzon had upheld their cause, by some of those who were most\r\nbitterly opposed to him when he was in India. They know, on the other\r\nhand, that though the British Labour Party can afford to profess great\r\nsympathy for Indian political aspirations in India, it has never\r\ntried--or, if it has tried, it has signally failed--to exercise the\r\nslightest influence in favour of Indian claims to fair treatment with\r\nits allies in the Colonies, where the Labour Party is always the most\r\nuncompromising advocate of a policy of exclusion and oppression, and\r\nthey know the power which the Labour Party wields in all our Colonies.\r\n\r\nThey are, therefore, I believe, ready, to reckon with the realities of\r\nthe situation and to agree with Lord Curzon that \"the common rights of\r\nBritish citizenship cannot be held to override the rights of\r\nself-protection conceded to self-governing Colonies\"--rights which,\r\nmoreover, are often exercised to the detriment of immigrants from the\r\nMother Country itself. They will, on the other hand, urge the\r\nwithholding of Indian labour if the Colonies are unwilling to treat it\r\nwith fairness and humanity, and they argue rightly enough, that India,\r\nto whom the emigration of tens of thousands of her people is not an\r\nunmixed advantage, will lose far less than Colonies whose development\r\nwill be starved by the loss of labour they cannot themselves supply. An\r\ninfluential Indian Member stated in Council that they have accepted the\r\nview that complete freedom of immigration is beyond the pale of\r\npractical politics, and is not to be pressed as things stand. All that\r\nthey ask, he added, in the Transvaal is for the old Indian residents to\r\nbe allowed to live peaceably, as in Cape Colony for instance, without\r\nbeing treated like habitual criminals, and for men of education and\r\nposition to be allowed to come in, so that they may have teachers,\r\nministers of religion, and doctors for themselves and their people. In\r\nNatal they ask for the maintenance of the rights and privileges they\r\nhave had for years and years. On such lines a practical working\r\narrangement with the Colonies should not be beyond the bounds of\r\npossibility. But what Indians also demand is that laws and regulations\r\nof an exceptional character which may be accepted in regard to\r\nimmigration shall not be applicable to Indians who merely wish to travel\r\nin the Colonies. An Indian of very high position whom every one from the\r\nKing downwards welcomes when he comes to England, wished a few years ago\r\nto visit Australia, but before doing so he wrote to a friend there to\r\ninquire whether he would be subjected to any unpleasant formalities. The\r\nanswer he received discouraged him. These are the sort of difficulties\r\nwhich Indians claim should be removed, and one practical suggestion I\r\nhave heard put forward is that, on certain principles to be laid down by\r\nmutual agreement between the Imperial Government, the Governments of\r\nthe Dominions, and the Government of India, the latter should have power\r\nto issue passports to Indian subjects which would be recognized and\r\nwould exempt them from all vexatious formalities throughout the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe whole question is one that cannot be allowed to drag on indefinitely\r\nwithout grave danger to the Empire. It evidently cannot be solved\r\nwithout the co-operation of the Colonies. Next year the Imperial\r\nConference meets again in the capital of the Empire. If, in the\r\nmeantime, the Imperial Government were to enter into communication with\r\nthe Government of India and with the Crown Colonies, so many of whom are\r\nclosely interested in Indian labour, they should be in a position to lay\r\nbefore the representatives of the Dominions assembled in London next\r\nMarch considered proposals which would afford a basis for discussion\r\nand, one may hope, for a definite agreement. A recognition of the right\r\nof Colonial Governments to regulate the conditions on which British\r\nIndians may be allowed admission as indentured labourers or for\r\npermanent residence ought to secure guarantees for the equitable and\r\nhumane treatment of those who have been already admitted, or shall\r\nhereafter be admitted, and also an undertaking that Indians of good\r\nposition armed with specified credentials from the Government of India,\r\ntravelling either for pleasure or for purposes of scientific study or on\r\nbusiness or with other legitimate motives, would be allowed to enter and\r\ntravel about for a reasonable period without let or hindrance of any\r\nsort. That is the _minimum_ which would, I believe, satisfy the best\r\nIndian opinion, and it is inconceivable that if the situation were\r\nfreely and frankly explained to our Colonial kinsmen they would reject a\r\nsettlement so essential to the interests and to the credit of the whole\r\nEmpire in relation to India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND OFFICIAL RELATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn few subjects are more ignorant or malevolent statements made than on\r\nthe attitude of Englishmen in India towards the natives of the country.\r\nThat social relations between Englishmen and Indians seldom grow\r\nintimate is true enough, but not that the fault lies mainly with\r\nEnglishmen. At the risk of being trite, I must recall a few elementary\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nThe bedrock difficulty is that Indian customs prevent any kind of\r\nintimacy between English and Indian families. Even in England the\r\nrelations between men who are excluded from acquaintance with each\r\nother's families can rarely be called intimate, and except in the very\r\nfew cases of Indian families that are altogether Westernized, Indian\r\nhabits rigidly exclude Englishmen from admission into the homes of\r\nIndian gentlemen, whether Hindu or Mahomedan. Intercourse between Indian\r\nand English ladies is in the same way almost entirely confined to formal\r\nvisits paid by the latter to the zenana and the harem, and to so-called\r\n_Purdah_ parties, given in English houses, in which Indian ladies are\r\nentertained as far as possible under the same conditions that prevail in\r\ntheir own homes--i.e., to the total exclusion of all males. So long as\r\nIndian ladies are condemned to a life of complete seclusion the\r\ninterests they have in common with their English visitors must\r\nnecessarily be very few. On the other hand, it is not surprising that\r\nEnglishmen, knowing the views that many Indian men entertain with regard\r\nto the position of women, do not care to encourage them to visit their\r\nown houses on a footing of intimacy that would necessarily bring them\r\ninto more or less familiar contact with their English wives and sisters\r\nand daughters. There is very much to admire in the family relations, and\r\nespecially in the filial relations, that exist in an Indian home,\r\nwhether Hindu or Mahomedan, but it is idle to pretend that Indian ideas\r\nwith regard to the relations between the sexes are the same as ours. In\r\nthese circumstances any social fusion between even the better classes of\r\nthe two races seems to be for the present out of the question.\r\n\r\nVery sincere and creditable efforts are now, it is true, being made on\r\nboth sides to diminish the gulf that divides English and Indian society,\r\nand I have been at various gatherings which were attended by Englishmen\r\nand Englishwomen and by Indians, among whom there was sometimes even a\r\nsprinkling of Indian ladies. But the English host and hostess invariably\r\nfound it difficult to prevent their Indian guests forming groups of\r\ntheir own, and each group seemed to be as reluctant to mingle with other\r\nIndian groups of a different class or caste as with their English\r\nfellow-guests. Indian society has been for centuries split up by race\r\nand caste and creed distinctions into so many watertight compartments\r\nthat it does not care for the Western forms of social intercourse, which\r\ntend to ignore those distinctions. It is Indians themselves who regard\r\nus, much more than we regard ourselves, as a separate caste. Moreover,\r\nfor the ordinary and somewhat desultory conversation which plays so\r\nlarge a part in Western sociability the Indian has very little\r\nunderstanding. He always imagines that conversation must have some\r\ndefinite purpose, and though he has far, more than most English men, the\r\ngift of ready and courteous speech, and often will talk for a long time\r\nboth discursively and pleasantly, it is almost always as a preliminary\r\nto the introduction of some particular topic in which his personal\r\ninterests are more or less directly involved. A question which causes a\r\ngood deal of soreness is the rigid exclusion of Indians from many\r\nAnglo-Indian clubs. But though a little more elasticity as to the\r\nentertainment of Indian \"guests\" might reasonably be conceded to Indian\r\nsusceptibilities, a club is after all just as much as his house an\r\nEnglishman's castle, and it is only in India that any one would venture\r\nto suggest that a club should not settle its rules of membership as it\r\nthinks fit. In the large cities at least there should, however, be room\r\nfor clubs which, like the Calcutta Club at Calcutta, serve the very\r\nuseful purpose of bringing together by mutual consent the higher classes\r\nof Indians and Englishmen, official and non-official. Yet even there the\r\nexigencies of caste observances, especially in the case of Hindus,\r\nmilitate against the more convivial forms of intercourse which the\r\nEnglishman particularly affects. There are not a few Hindu members who\r\nwill talk or play bridge with their English fellow-members into the\r\nsmall hours of the morning, but who consider themselves bound in\r\nconscience not to sit down to dinner with them; whilst some will\r\ndoubtless feel obliged to perform ceremonial ablutions when they go\r\nhome. Others again, for similar reasons, would decline to join any\r\nEuropean club. They are no more to be blamed than Englishmen who prefer\r\nto reserve membership of their clubs to Europeans, but the fact remains\r\nand has to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nThe best and most satisfactory relations are those maintained between\r\nEnglishmen and Indians who understand and respect each other's\r\npeculiarities. No class of Englishman in India fulfils those conditions\r\nmore fully than the Indian Civil Service. It is, I know, the _bête\r\nnoire_ of the Indian politician, and even Englishmen who ought to know\r\nbetter seem to think that, once they have labelled it a \"bureaucracy,\"\r\nthat barbarous name is enough to hang it--or enough, at least, to lend\r\nplausibility to the charge that Anglo-Indian administrators are arrogant\r\nand harsh in their personal dealings with Indians and ignorant and\r\nunsympathetic in their methods of government.\r\n\r\nThat the English civilian goes out to India with a tolerably high\r\nintellectual and moral equipment can hardly be disputed, for he\r\nrepresents the pick of the young men who qualify for our Civil Service\r\nat home as well as abroad, and in respect of character, integrity, and\r\nintelligence the British Civil Service can challenge comparison with\r\nthat of any other country in the world. Why should he suddenly change\r\ninto a narrow-minded, petty tyrant as soon as he sets foot in India? A\r\ngreat part at least of his career is spent in the very closest contact\r\nwith the people, for he often lives for years together in remote\r\ndistricts where he has practically no other society than that of\r\nnatives. He generally knows and speaks fluently more than one\r\nvernacular, though, owing to the multiplicity of Indian languages--there\r\nare five, for instance, in the Bombay Presidency alone--- he may find\r\nhimself suddenly transferred to a district in which the vernaculars he\r\nhas learnt are of no use to him. Part of his time is always spent \"in\r\ncamp\"--_i.e._ moving about from village to village, receiving petitions,\r\ninvestigating cases, listening to complaints. Perhaps none of the\r\nordinary duties of administration bring him so closely into touch with\r\nthe people as the collection of land revenue, for it is there that his\r\nsense of fairness comes most conspicuously into play and wins\r\nrecognition. Hence, for instance, in Bengal one of the bad results of\r\nthe \"Permanent Settlement\" of the land revenue, which leaves no room for\r\nthe Collector's ordinary work, has been that the people and the civilian\r\nknow generally less about each other than in other parts of India. Few\r\nIndians venture to impugn the Englishman's integrity and impartiality in\r\nadjudging cases in which material interests are concerned, or in\r\nsettling differences between natives; and nowhere are those qualities\r\nmore valuable and more highly appreciated than in a country accustomed\r\nfor centuries to every form of oppression and of social pressure for\r\nwhich the multitudinous claims of caste and family open up endless\r\nopportunities. As he has no permanent ties of his own in India, it does\r\nnot matter to him personally whether the individual case he has to\r\nsettle goes in favour of A or of B, or whether the native official, whom\r\nhe appoints or promotes, belongs to this or to that caste. The people\r\nknow this, and because they have learned to trust the Englishman's sense\r\nof fair play, they appeal, whenever they get the chance, to the European\r\nofficial rather than to one of their own race. But it is especially in\r\ntimes of stress, in the evil days of famine or of plague, that they turn\r\nto him for help. Nowhere is the \"sun-dried bureaucrat\" seen to better\r\nadvantage than in the famine or plague camp, where the \"bureaucrat\"\r\nwould come hopelessly to grief, but where the English civilian, not\r\nbeing a \"bureaucrat,\" triumphs over difficulties by sheer force of\r\ncharacter and power of initiative. It is just in such emergencies, for\r\nwhich the most elaborate \"regulations\" cannot wholly provide, that the\r\nsuperiority of the European over the native official is most\r\nconspicuous. If \"Padgett, M.P.\", would go out to India in the hot rather\r\nthan in the cold weather, and instead of either merely enjoying the\r\nsplendid hospitality of the chief centres of Anglo-Indian society, or\r\nborrowing his views of British administration from the Indian\r\npoliticians of the large cities, would spend some of his time with a\r\ncivilian in an up-country station and follow his daily round of work\r\namidst the real people of India, he would probably come home with very\r\ndifferent and much more accurate ideas of what India is and of what the\r\nrelations are between the Anglo-Indian official and the natives of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFar from having flooded India, as is often alleged, with a horde of\r\noverpaid officials, we may justly claim that no Western nation has ever\r\nattempted to govern an alien dependency with a smaller staff of its own\r\nrace, or has admitted the subject races to so large a participation in\r\nits public services. The whole vast machinery of executive and judicial\r\nadministration in British India employs over 1,250,000 Indians, and only\r\na little more than 5,000 Englishmen altogether, of whom about one-sixth\r\nconstitute what is called _par excellence_ the Civil Service of India.\r\nNot the least remarkable achievement of British rule has been the\r\nbuilding up of a great body of Indian public servants capable of rising\r\nto offices of great trust. Not only, for instance, do Indian Judges sit\r\non the Bench in the High Courts on terms of complete equality with their\r\nEuropean colleagues, but magisterial work all over India is done chiefly\r\nby Indians. The same holds good of the Revenue Department and of the\r\nmuch, and often very unjustly, abused Department of Police; and, in\r\nfact, as Anglo-Indian officials are the first to acknowledge, there is\r\nnot a department which could be carried on to-day without the loyal and\r\nintelligent co-operation of the Indian public servant. There is room for\r\nimproving the position of Indians, not only, as I have already pointed\r\nout, in the Educational Department, but probably in every branch of the\r\n\"Provincial\" service, which corresponds roughly with what was formerly\r\ncalled the \"Un-covenanted\" service. As far back as 1879 Lord Lytton laid\r\ndown rules which gave to natives of India one-sixth of the appointments\r\nuntil then reserved for the \"Covenanted\" service, and we have certainly\r\nnot yet reached the limit of the number of Indians who may ultimately\r\nwith advantage be employed in the different branches of the public\r\nservice; but few who know the defects as well as the good qualities of\r\nthe native will deny that to reduce hastily the European leaven in any\r\ndepartment would be to jeopardize its moral as well as its\r\nadministrative efficiency. The condition of the police, for instance, is\r\na case in point, for any survival of the bad old native traditions is\r\ndue very largely to the insufficiency of European control. Mr. Gokhale\r\nhas himself admitted as one of the reasons for founding his society of\r\n\"Servants of India\" the necessity of \"building up a higher type of\r\ncharacter and capacity than is generally available in the country.\" For\r\nthe same reason we must move slowly and cautiously in substituting\r\nIndians for Europeans in the very small number of posts which the latter\r\nstill occupy. That the highest offices of executive control must be very\r\nlargely held by Englishmen so long as we continue to be responsible for\r\nthe government of India is admitted by all but the most \"advanced\"\r\nIndian politicians, and it is to qualify for and to hold such positions\r\nthat the Indian Civil Service--formerly the \"Covenanted\" service--is\r\nmaintained. It consists of a small _élite_ of barely I,200 men, mostly,\r\nbut not exclusively, Englishmen, for it includes nearly 100 Indians. It\r\nis recruited by competitive examinations held in England, and this is\r\none of the chief grievances of Indians. But in order to preserve the\r\nvery high standard it has hitherto maintained, it seems essential that\r\nIndians who wish to enter it should have had not only the Western\r\neducation which Indian Universities might be expected to provide, but\r\nthe thoroughly English training which India certainly does not as yet\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the disaffected Indian politician the really unpardonable\r\nsin of the Civil Service is that it constitutes the bulwark of British\r\nrule, the one permanent link between the Government of India and the\r\nmanifold millions entrusted to their care. I have already had occasion\r\nto show, incidentally, how unfounded is the charge that, through\r\nignorance and want of sympathy, the British civilian is callous to the\r\nreal interests and sentiments of the people in dealing with the larger\r\nproblems of Indian statesmanship. The contrary is the case, for to him\r\nbelongs the credit of almost every measure passed during the last 50\r\nyears for the benefit of the Indian masses, and passed frequently in the\r\nteeth of vehement opposition from the Indian politician. Nor is it\r\nsurprising that it should be so. For the Indian politician--generally a\r\ntownsman--is, as a rule, drawn from and represents classes that have\r\nvery little in common with the great bulk of the people, who are\r\nagriculturists. The British civilian, on the other hand, often spends\r\nthe best years of his life in rural districts, seldom even visited by\r\nthe politician, and therefore knows much more about the needs and the\r\nfeelings of the people among whom he lives and moves. In the best sense\r\nof the word he is in fact the one real democrat in India. The very fact\r\nthat he is a bird of passage in the country makes him absolutely\r\nindependent of the class interests and personal bias to which the\r\npolitician is almost always liable. Moreover, the chief, and perfectly\r\nlegitimate, object to which the Anglo-Indian administrator is bound to\r\naddress himself is, as Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal once candidly admitted, to\r\ncapture \"the heart, the mind of the people ... to secure, if not the\r\nallegiance, at least the passive, the generous acquiescence of the\r\ngeneral mass of the population.\" To make his meaning perfectly clear,\r\nMr. Pal instanced the rural reforms, the agricultural banks and other\r\nthings which had been done in Lord Curzon's time, \"to captivate the mind\r\nof the teeming masses,\" and he added that \"he is a foolish politician in\r\nIndia who allows the Government to capture the mind of the masses to the\r\nexclusion of his own influence and his own countrymen.\" Mr. Pal is from\r\nhis point of view perfectly logical, and so were the writers in the\r\n_Yugantar_, who, when they elaborated their scheme of revolutionary\r\npropaganda, declared that the first step must be to undermine the\r\nconfidence of the people in their rulers and to destroy the spirit of\r\ncontentedness under an alien yoke. But could there be a more striking\r\ntribute to the intelligent and sympathetic treatment of the interests of\r\nthe Indian masses by their British rulers than such admissions on the\r\npart of the enemies of British rule?\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view nothing but good should result from the larger\r\nopportunities given by the recent reforms for the discussion of Indian\r\nquestions in the enlarged Councils, so long as the Indian\r\nrepresentatives in these Councils are drawn, as far as possible, from\r\nthe different classes which, to some extent, reflect the different\r\ninterests of the multitudinous communities that make up the people of\r\nIndia. The British civilian will have a much better chance than he has\r\nhitherto had of meeting his detractors in the open, and, if one may\r\njudge by the proceedings last winter, when the Councils met for the\r\nfirst time under the new conditions, there is little reason to fear, as\r\nmany did at first, that he will be taken at a disadvantage in debate\r\nowing to the greater fluency and rhetorical resourcefulness of the\r\nIndian politician. It was not only in the Imperial Council in Calcutta\r\nthat the official members, having the better case and stating it quite\r\nsimply, proved more than a match for the more exuberant eloquence of\r\ntheir opponents. On the contrary, the personal contact established in\r\nthe enlarged Councils between the Anglo-Indian official and the better\r\nclass of Indian politician may well serve to diminish the prejudices\r\nwhich exist on both sides. It is, I believe, quite a mistake to suppose\r\nthat the British civilian generally resents the recent reforms, though\r\nhe may very well resent the spirit of hostility and suspicion in which\r\nthey were advocated and welcomed in some quarters, as if they were\r\nspecially directed against the European element in the Civil Service. A\r\npractical difficulty is the heavy call which attendance in Council will\r\nmake upon Civil servants who have to represent Government in these\r\nassemblies. Already for many years past the amount of work, and\r\nespecially of office work, has steadily increased and without any\r\ncorresponding increase of the establishment. Hence the civilian has less\r\ntime to receive Indian visitors, and he is often obliged to curtail the\r\nperiod he spends during the year in camp. Hence also the growing\r\nfrequency of transfers and of officiating or temporary appointments.\r\nThere are, in fact, to-day barely enough men to go round, and,\r\nobviously, the more frequently a man is moved, the less chance he has of\r\ngetting thoroughly acquainted with the people among whom he has to work\r\nin a country such as India, where within the limits of the same province\r\nyou may find half a dozen widely different communities speaking\r\ndifferent languages and having different creeds and customs. Perhaps,\r\ntoo, for the same reasons, there is a tendency towards over-centralization\r\nin the \"Secretariats\" or permanent departments at the seat of government,\r\nwhether in Simla or in the provincial capitals, and the less favoured\r\ncivilian who bears the heat and burden of the day in the _mofussil_ is both\r\nmore dependent upon them and more jealous of the many advantages they\r\nnaturally enjoy. Posts and telegraphs and the multiplying of \"regulations\"\r\neverywhere tend to weaken personal initiative. Nor can it be denied that\r\nwith the increased facilities of travel to and from Europe civilians no\r\nlonger look upon India quite so much as their home. The local _liaisons_,\r\nnot uncommon in pre-Mutiny days, are now things of the past, and the\r\nmarried man of to-day who has to send his children home for their\r\neducation, and often his wife too, either on account of the climate or\r\nto look after the children, is naturally more disposed to count up his\r\nyears of service and to retire on his pension at the earliest opportunity.\r\nThe increased cost of living in India and the depreciation of the rupee\r\nhave also made the service less attractive from the purely pecuniary point\r\nof view, whilst in other ways it must suffer indirectly from such changes\r\nas the reduction of the European staff in the Indian Medical Department.\r\nThe substitution of Indian for European doctors in outlying stations where\r\nthere are no European practitioners is a distinct hardship for married\r\nofficials, as there is a good deal more than mere prejudice to explain the\r\nreluctance of Englishwomen to be treated by native medical advisers. Nor\r\nis it possible to disguise the soreness caused throughout the Indian Civil\r\nService by the recent appointment of a young member of the English\r\nCivil Service to one of the very highest posts in India. No one\r\nquestions Mr. Clark's ability, but is he really more able than every one\r\nof the many men who passed with him, and for many years before him,\r\nthrough the same door into the public service and elected to work in\r\nIndia rather than at home? No Minister would have thought of promoting\r\nhim now to an Under-Secretaryship of State in England, and apart from\r\nthe grave reflection upon the Indian Civil Service--- and the belief\r\ngenerally entertained amongst Indians that it was meant to be a\r\nreflection upon the Indian Civil Service--his appointment to a far\r\nhigher Indian office implies a grave misconception of the proper\r\nfunctions of a Council which constitutes the Government of India.\r\n\r\nNone of these minor considerations, however, will substantially affect\r\nthe future of the Indian Civil Service if only it continues to receive\r\nfrom public opinion at home, and from the Imperial Government as well as\r\nfrom the Government of India, the loyal support and encouragement which\r\nthe admirable work it performs, often under very trying conditions,\r\ndeserves. An unfortunate impression has undoubtedly been created during\r\nthe last few years in the Indian Civil Service that there is no longer\r\nthe same assurance of such support and encouragement either from\r\nWhitehall or from Simla, whilst the attacks of irresponsible partisans\r\nhave redoubled in intensity and virulence, and have found a louder and\r\nlouder echo both on the platform and in the Press at home. The loss of\r\ncontact between the Government of India and Anglo-Indian administrators\r\nhas been as painfully felt as the frigid tone of many official\r\nutterances in Parliament, which have seemed inspired by a desire more\r\noften to avoid party embarrassments at Westminster than to protect\r\npublic servants, who have no means of defending themselves, against even\r\nthe grossest forms of misrepresentation and calumny, leading straight to\r\nthe revolver and the bomb of the political assassin. The British\r\ncivilian is not going to be frightened by one more risk added to the\r\nvicissitudes of an Indian career, but can you expect him to be proof\r\nagainst discouragement when many of his fellow-countrymen exhaust their\r\ningenuity in extenuating or in casting upon him the primary\r\nresponsibility for the new Indian gospel of murder which is being\r\npreached against him? Mr. Montagu was well inspired in protesting\r\nagainst such \"hostile, unsympathetic, and cowardly criticism\" as was\r\nconveyed in Mr. Mackarness's pamphlet; but this pamphlet was mere sour\r\nmilk compared with the vitriol which the native Press had been allowed\r\nto pour forth day after day on the British official in India before any\r\naction was taken by Government to defend him.\r\n\r\nThe new Viceroy, who himself belongs to one of the most important\r\nbranches of the British Civil Service, may be trusted to display in his\r\nhandling of the British civilian the tact and sympathy required to\r\nsustain him in the performance of arduous duties which are bound to\r\nbecome more complex and exacting as our system of government departs\r\nfurther from the old patriarchal type. Our task in India must grow more\r\nand more difficult, and will demand more than ever the best men that we\r\ncan give to its accomplishment. The material prizes which an Indian\r\ncareer has to offer may be fewer and less valuable, whilst the pressure\r\nof work, the penalties of exile, the hardship of frequent separation\r\nfrom kith and kin, the drawbacks of an always trying and often\r\ntreacherous climate, will for the most part not diminish. But the many\r\nsided interests and the real magnitude and loftiness of the work to be\r\ndone in India will continue to attract the best Englishmen so long as\r\nthey can rely upon fair treatment at the hands of the Mother Country. If\r\nthat failed them there would speedily be an end not only to the Indian\r\nCivil Service, but to British rule itself. For the sword cannot govern,\r\nonly maintain government, and can maintain it only as long as government\r\nitself retains the respect and acquiescence of the great masses of the\r\nIndian peoples which have been won, not by generals or by Secretaries of\r\nState, or even by Viceroys, but by the patient and often obscure\r\nspadework of the Indian Civil Service--by its integrity, its courage,\r\nits knowledge, its efficiency, and its unfailing sense of justice.\r\n\r\nComplaints of the aloofness of the British civilian very seldom proceed\r\neither from Indians of the upper classes or from the humbler folk. They\r\ngenerally proceed from the new, more or less Western-educated middle\r\nclass whose attitude towards British officials is seldom calculated to\r\npromote cordial relations; and they are also sometimes inspired by\r\nanother class of Indian who, one may hope, will before long have\r\nvanished, but whom of all others the civilian is bound to keep at arm's\r\nlength. There are men who would get a hold upon him, if he is a young\r\nman, by luring him into intrigues with native women, or by inveigling\r\nhim into the meshes of the native moneylender, or who, by less\r\nreprehensible means, strive to establish themselves on a footing of\r\nintimacy with him merely in order to sell to other Indians the influence\r\nwhich they acquire or pretend to have acquired over him. Cases of this\r\nkind are no doubt rare, and growing more and more rare, as social\r\nconditions are passing away which in earlier days favoured them. Less\r\nobjectionable, but nevertheless to be kept also at arm's length, is the\r\nfar more numerous class of natives known in India as _umedwars_, who are\r\nalways anxious to seize on to the coat tails of the Anglo-Indian\r\nofficial in order to heighten their own social _status_, and, if\r\npossible, to wheedle out of Government some of those minor titles or\r\nhonorific distinctions to which Indian society attaches so much\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIn other branches of the public service selection has not always\r\noperated as successfully as the competitive system for the Civil\r\nService. Men are too often sent out as lawyers or as doctors, or even,\r\nas I have already pointed out, to join the Education Department, with\r\ninadequate qualifications, and they are allowed to enter upon their\r\nwork without any knowledge of the language and customs of the people.\r\nSuch cases are generally the result of carelessness or ignorance at\r\nhome, but some of them, I fear, can only be described as \"jobs\"--and\r\nthere is no room in India for jobs. The untravelled Indian is also\r\nbrought into contact to-day with an entirely different class of\r\nEnglishman. The globe-trotter, who is often an American, though the\r\nnative cannot be expected to distinguish between him and the Englishman,\r\nconstantly sins from sheer ignorance against the customs of the country.\r\nThen, again, with railways and telegraphs and the growth of commerce and\r\nindustry a type of Englishman has been imported to fill subordinate\r\npositions in which some technical knowledge is required, who, whatever\r\nhis good qualities, is much rougher and generally much more strongly\r\nimbued with, or more prone to display, a sense of racial superiority.\r\nNor is he kept under the same discipline as Tommy Atkins, who is\r\ngenerally an easy-going fellow, and looks upon the native with\r\ngood-natured, if somewhat contemptuous, amusement, though he, too, is\r\nsometimes a rough customer when he gets \"above himself,\" or when his\r\ntemper is ruffled by prickly heat, that most common but irritating of\r\nhot-weather ailments. In this connexion the remarkable growth of\r\ntemperance among British soldiers in India is doubly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the relations between the lower classes of Europeans and\r\nnatives in the large cities, where they practically alone come into\r\ncontact, seldom give rise to serious trouble; and it is between\r\nEuropeans and natives of the higher classes that, unfortunately,\r\npersonal disputes from time to time occur, which unquestionably produce\r\na great deal of bad blood--disputes in which Englishmen have forgotten\r\nnot only the most elementary rules of decent behaviour, but the\r\nself-respect which our position in India makes it doubly obligatory on\r\nevery Englishman to observe in his dealings with Indians. Some of these\r\nincidents have been wilfully exaggerated, others have been wantonly\r\ninvented. Most of them have taken place in the course of railway\r\njourneys, and without wishing to palliate them, one may reasonably point\r\nout that, even in Europe, people, when travelling, will often behave\r\nwith a rudeness which they would be ashamed to display in other\r\ncircumstances, and that long railway journeys in the stifling heat of\r\nIndia sometimes subject the temper to a strain unknown in more temperate\r\nclimates. In some cases, too, it is our ignorance of native customs\r\nwhich causes the trouble, and the habits of even high-class Indians are\r\nnow and then unpleasant. A few months ago, I shared a railway\r\ncompartment one night with an Indian gentleman of good position and\r\npleasant address, belonging to a sect which carries to the most extreme\r\nlengths the respect for all forms of life, however repulsive. Had I been\r\na stranger to India and ignorant of these conscientious eccentricities,\r\nI might well have objected very strongly to some of the proceedings of\r\nmy companion, who spent a good deal of his time in searching his person\r\nand his garments for certain forms of animal life, which he carefully\r\ndeposited in a little silver box carried for this special purpose.\r\nNevertheless it must be admitted that there have been from time to time\r\ncases of brutality towards natives sufficiently gross and inexcusable to\r\ncreate a very deplorable impression. I have met educated Indians who,\r\nthough they have had no unpleasant experiences of the kind themselves,\r\nprefer to avoid entering a railway carriage occupied by Europeans lest\r\nthey should expose themselves even to the chance of insulting treatment.\r\nOn the other hand, speaking from personal experience as well as from\r\nwhat I have heard on unimpeachable authority, I have no hesitation in\r\nsaying that there are evil-disposed, Indians, especially of late years,\r\nwho deliberately seek to provoke disagreeable incidents by their own\r\nmisbehaviour, either in the hope of levying blackmail or in order to\r\nmake political capital by posing as the victims of English brutality.\r\nBut even when Englishmen put themselves entirely in the wrong, there is\r\nperhaps a tendency amongst Anglo-Indians--chiefly amongst the\r\nnon-official community--to treat such cases with undue leniency, and it\r\nis one of the curious ironies of fate that Lord Curzon, whom the\r\nNationalist Press has singled out for constant abuse and denunciation as\r\nthe prototype of official tyranny, was the one Viceroy who more than any\r\nother jeopardized his popularity with his fellow countrymen in India by\r\ninsisting upon rigorous justice being done where Indians had, in his\r\nopinion, suffered wrongs of this kind at the hands of Europeans.\r\n\r\nIt is a lamentable fact that, amongst Indians, the greatest bitterness\r\nwith regard to the social relations between the two races often proceeds\r\nfrom those who have been educated in England. There is, first of all,\r\nthe young Indian who, having mixed freely with the best type of\r\nEnglishmen and Englishwomen, finds himself on his return to India quite\r\nout of touch with his own people, and yet has to live their life. Cases\r\nof this kind are especially pathetic, when, having imbibed European\r\nideals of womanhood, he is obliged to marry some girl chosen by his\r\nparents, with whom, however estimable she may be, he has nothing in\r\ncommon. Such is the contrariety of human nature that he usually visits\r\nhis unhappiness, not on the social system which has resumed its hold\r\nupon him, but on the civilization which has killed his belief in it.\r\nThen there is the very mischievous type of young Indian who, having been\r\nleft to his own devices in England, and without any good introductions,\r\nbrings back to India and retails there impressions of English society,\r\nmale and female, gathered from the very undesirable surroundings into\r\nwhich he has drifted in London and other large cities. It is he who is\r\noften responsible for one of the most deplorable features in the\r\npropaganda of the seditious Press--namely, the scandalous libels upon\r\nthe character of English domestic life, and especially upon the morality\r\nof English womanhood--by which it is sought to undermine popular\r\nrespect for and confidence in the Englishman. But our own responsibility\r\nmust also be very great, so long as we allow the young Indian who comes\r\nto England to drift hopelessly, without help or guidance, among the\r\nrocks and shoals of English life. Men of our own race, and carefully\r\npicked men, come from our oversea Dominions to study in our colleges,\r\nand we have a special organization to look after their moral and\r\nmaterial welfare. For years past we have allowed young Indians to come\r\nand go, and no responsible hand has been stretched out to save them from\r\nthe manifold temptations of an entirely alien society in which isolation\r\nis almost bound to spell degradation and bitterness.\r\n\r\nConsidering, however, the many inevitable causes of friction and the\r\ninherent imperfections of human nature, whether white or coloured, one\r\nmay safely say that between Englishmen of all conditions and Indians of\r\nall conditions there often and, indeed, generally exist pleasanter\r\nrelations than are to be found elsewhere between people of any two races\r\nso widely removed. They are never closer than when special circumstances\r\nhelp to break down the barriers. The common instincts and the common\r\ndangers of their profession create often singularly strong ties of\r\nregard and affection between the sepoy of all ranks and his British\r\nofficers--especially on campaign. In domestic tribulations, as well as\r\nin public calamities, Indians, at least of the lower classes, will often\r\nturn more readily and confidently for help to the Englishman who lives\r\namongst them than to their own people. I need not quote instances of the\r\nextraordinary influence which many European missionaries have acquired\r\nby their devoted labours amongst the poor, the sick, and the suffering,\r\nand in former times, perhaps more than in recent times, even with\r\nIndians of the higher classes. In ordinary circumstances we have to\r\nrecognize the existence of both sides of obstacles to anything like\r\nintimacy. Many Indian ideas and habits are repugnant to us, but so also\r\nare many of ours to them. Indians have their own conceptions of dignity\r\nand propriety which our social customs frequently offend. If Englishmen\r\nand Englishwomen in high places in India would exert their influence to\r\ninvest the social life of Europeans in the chief resorts of Anglo-Indian\r\nsociety with a little more decorum and seriousness, they would probably\r\nbe doing better service to a good understanding between the two races in\r\nsocial matters than by trying to break down by sheer insistence, however\r\nwell meant, the barriers which diametrically opposite forms of\r\ncivilization have placed between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the very able speech in which, on July 27, Mr. Montagu, the new\r\nUnder-Secretary of State for India, introduced the Indian Budget in the\r\nHouse of Commons, one passage referred to the relations between the\r\nSecretary of State and the Viceroy in terms which have deservedly\r\nattracted very great attention[23]. Differences of opinion, sometimes of\r\nan acute character, have at intervals occurred between Secretaries of\r\nState and Viceroys as to their relative attributions. Mr. Montagu's\r\nlanguage, however, would seem to constitute an assertion of the powers\r\nof the Secretary of State far in excess not only of past practice but of\r\nany reasonable interpretation of legislative enactments on the subject.\r\nAfter congratulating Lord Minto on the completion of, a \"difficult\r\nreign,\" Mr. Montagu said:--\r\n\r\n   The relations of a Viceroy to the Secretary of State are\r\n   intimate and responsible. The Act of Parliament says\r\n   \"That the Secretary of State in Council shall superintend,\r\n   direct, and control all acts, operations, and concerns which in\r\n   any way relate to or concern the government or revenues of\r\n   India, and all grants of salaries, gratuities, and allowances,\r\n   and all other payments and charges whatever out of or on\r\n   the revenues of India.\" It will be seen how wide, how far\r\n   reaching, and how complete these powers are. Lord Morley\r\n   and his Council, working through the agency of Lord Minto,\r\n   have accomplished much.... I believe that men of\r\n   all parties will be grateful that Lord Morley remains to carry\r\n   out the policy he has initiated.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted in the first place that Mr. Montagu should not\r\nhave been more careful to make his quotation accurate. For, as quoted by\r\nhim, the Act would make it obligatory upon the Secretary of State to\r\nsupervise practically every act of the Government of India, whereas the\r\npowers of the Secretary of State, who has succeeded to the powers of the\r\nold Board of Control of the East India Company, are discretionary\r\npowers. The statute from which the Secretary of State actually derives\r\nhis powers is the Government of India Act, 1858, which under section 3\r\ndeclares that the Secretary of State \"shall have and perform all such or\r\nthe like powers and duties in any wise relating to the government or\r\nrevenues of India and all such or the like powers over all officers\r\nappointed or continued under this Act as might or should have been\r\nexercised or performed\" by the Company and Board of Control, and those\r\npowers and duties are defined in the following terms in the Act of 1833\r\n(3 and 4 William IV., c. 85, sec. 25), which Mr. Montagu would seem to\r\nhave had in his mind, though he quoted it imperfectly: \"The said Board\r\n[of Control] shall have and be invested with full power and authority to\r\nsuperintend, direct, and control all acts, operations, and concerns,\r\n&c.\" The difference, as has been very properly pointed out in the\r\n_Manchester Guardian_, no unfriendly critic of the present\r\nAdministration, is \"between exercising control and the power to exercise\r\ncontrol, between 'shall' and 'may.' If these words of the Act were to be\r\nabbreviated, the right abbreviation would have been 'may.' This is the\r\nword used by Sir Courtenay Ilbert in his summary of the Secretary of\r\nState's powers (The Government of India, p. 145);--'... the Secretary\r\nof State may, subject to the provisions embodied in this digest,\r\nsuperintend, direct, and control all acts, operations, and concerns,\r\n&c.' This difference between 'shall' and 'may' is, of course, vital.\r\n'Shall' implies that the Secretary of State is standing over the Viceroy\r\nin everything he does; 'may' simply reserves to him the right of control\r\nwhere he disapproves. 'Shall' imparts an agency of an inferior order;\r\n'may' safeguards the rights of the Crown and Parliament without\r\nimpairing the dignity of the Viceregal office.\"\r\n\r\nOf greater importance, however, is the construction which Mr. Montagu\r\nplaces on these statutes. There are three fundamental objections to the\r\ndoctrine of \"agency\" which he propounds in regard to the functions of\r\nthe Viceroy. In the first place, it ignores one of the most important\r\nfeatures of his office--one, indeed, to which supreme importance\r\nattaches in a country such as India, where the sentiment of reverence\r\nfor the Sovereign is rooted in the most ancient traditions of all races\r\nand creeds. The Viceroy is the direct and personal representative of the\r\nKing-Emperor, and in that capacity, at any rate, it would certainly be\r\nimproper to describe him as the \"agent\" of the Secretary of State. From\r\nthis point of view, any attempt to lower his office would tend\r\ndangerously to weaken the prestige of the Crown, which, to put it on the\r\nlowest grounds, is one of the greatest assets of the British _Raj_. In\r\nthe second place, Mr. Montagu ignores equally another distinctive\r\nfeature of the Viceroy's office, especially important in regard to his\r\nrelations with the Secretary of State--namely, that, in his executive as\r\nwell as in his legislative capacity, the Viceroy is not a mere\r\nindividual, but the Governor-General in Council. Mr. Montagu omitted to\r\nquote the important section of the Act of 1833, confirmed in subsequent\r\nenactments, which declared that:--\r\n\r\n   The superintendence, direction, and control of the whole\r\n   civil and military government of all the said territories and\r\n   revenues in India shall be and is hereby vested in a Governor-General\r\n   and Councillors to be styled \"the Governor-General\r\n   of India in Council.\"\r\n\r\nThe only title recognized by statute to the Viceroy is that of\r\nGovernor-General in Council, and how material is this conjunction of the\r\nGovernor-General with his Council is shown by the exceptional character\r\nof the circumstances in which power is given to the Governor-General to\r\nact on his own responsibility alone, and by the extreme rareness of the\r\ncases in which a Governor-General has exercised that power.\r\n\r\nThus, on the one hand, Mr. Montagu forgets the Crown when he talks of\r\nthe Secretary of State acting through the agency of the Viceroy; and, on\r\nthe other hand, he forgets the Governor-General in Council when he talks\r\nof the relations between the Viceroy and the Secretary of State--whose\r\nproper designation, moreover, is Secretary of State in Council, for,\r\nlike the Governor-General, the Secretary of State has a Council\r\nintimately associated with him by statute in the discharge of his\r\nconstitutional functions. Though the cases in which the Secretary of\r\nState cannot act without the concurrence of the Council of India, who\r\nsit with him at the India Office, are limited to matters involving the\r\ngrant or appropriation of revenues, and in other matters he is not\r\nabsolutely bound to consult them and still less to accept their\r\nrecommendations, the Act of Parliament quoted by Mr. Montagu clearly\r\nimplies that, in the exercise of all the functions which it assigns to\r\nhim, he is expected to act generally in consultation and in concert with\r\nhis Council, since those functions are assigned to him specifically as\r\nSecretary of State in Council.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the nature of the relations between the Governor-General in\r\nCouncil and the Secretary of State in Council as above defined by\r\nstatute. The ultimate responsibility for Indian government, as Mr.\r\nMontagu intimated, rests unquestionably with the Imperial Government\r\nrepresented by the Secretary of State for India, and therefore, in the\r\nlast resort, with the people of the United Kingdom represented by\r\nParliament. The question is, What is in theory and practice the proper\r\nmode of discharging this, \"ultimate responsibility\" for Indian\r\ngovernment? It is not a question which can be authoritatively answered,\r\nbut, if we may infer an answer from the spirit of legislative enactments\r\nand from the usage that has hitherto prevailed, it may still be summed\r\nup in the same language in which John Stuart Mill described the function\r\nof the Home Government in the days of the old East India Company--\"The\r\nprincipal function of the Home Government is not to direct the details\r\nof administration, but to scrutinize and revise the past acts of the\r\nIndian Governments; to lay down principles and to issue general\r\ninstructions for their future guidance, and to give or refuse sanction\r\nto great political measures which are referred home for approval.\" This\r\nseems undoubtedly to be the view of the relations, inherited from the\r\nEast India Company, between the Secretary of State and the Government of\r\nIndia which has been accepted and acted upon on both sides until\r\nrecently. Nor is any other view compatible with the Charter Act of 1833,\r\nor with the Government of India Act of 1858, which, in all matters\r\npertinent to this issue, was based upon, and confirmed the principles of\r\nthe earlier statute. The Secretary of State exercises general guidance\r\nand control, but, as Mill laid it down no less forcibly, \"the Executive\r\nGovernment of India is and must be seated in India itself.\" Such\r\nrelations are clearly very different from those of principal and agent\r\nwhich Mr. Montagu would apparently wish to substitute for them.\r\n\r\nBesides the special emphasis he laid on his definition of the relations\r\nbetween the Viceroy and the Secretary of State, other reasons have led\r\nto the belief that the Under-Secretary, who spoke with a full sense of\r\nhis responsibility as the representative of the Secretary of State, was\r\ngiving calculated expression to the views of his chief. I am not going\r\nto anticipate the duties of the historian, whose business it will be to\r\nestablish the share of initiative and responsibility that belong to Lord\r\nMorley and Lord Minto respectively in regard to the Indian policy of\r\nthe last five years. Whilst something more than an impression generally\r\nprevails both at home and in India that Mr. Montagu's definition does in\r\nfact very largely apply to the relations between the present Viceroy and\r\nthe Secretary of State, and that every measure carried out in India has\r\noriginated in Whitehall, it is only fair to bear in mind that Lord\r\nMorley has never himself put forward any such claim, nor has Lord Minto\r\never admitted it. The Viceroy, on the contrary, has been at pains to\r\nemphasize on several occasions his share, and indeed to claim for\r\nhimself the initiative, of all the principal measures carried out during\r\nhis tenure of office, and especially of the new scheme of Indian\r\nreforms, of which the paternity is ascribed by most people to Lord\r\nMorley.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State's great personality may partly account for the\r\nbelief that he has entirely overshadowed the Viceroy, all the more in\r\nthat he has certainly overshadowed the Council of India as never before.\r\nBut if Lord Minto has reason to complain, of the prevalence of this\r\nbelief, he cannot be unaware that he too has helped to build it up by\r\nneglecting to associate his own Council with himself as closely as even\r\nhis most masterful predecessors had hitherto been careful to do.\r\n\r\nLord Minto's position has no doubt been one of very peculiar difficulty,\r\nand no one will grudge him the warm tribute paid to him by Mr. Montagu.\r\nWhatever the merits of the great controversy between Lord Curzon and\r\nLord Kitchener, the overruling of the Government of India by the Home\r\nGovernment on a question of such magnitude and the circumstances in\r\nwhich Lord Curzon was compelled to resign had dealt a very heavy blow to\r\nthe authority and prestige of the Viceregal office in India. Within a\r\nfew weeks of Lord Minto's arrival in India the Unionist Government who\r\nhad appointed him fell, and a Liberal Government came into power who\r\ncould not be expected to display any special consideration for their\r\npredecessors nominee unless he showed himself to be in sympathy with\r\ntheir policy. Lord Minto's friends can therefore very reasonably argue\r\nthat his chief anxiety was, quite legitimately, to avoid any kind of\r\nfriction with the new Secretary of State which might have led to the\r\nsupersession of another Viceroy so soon after the unfortunate crisis\r\nthat had ended in Lord Curzon's resignation. If this was the object that\r\nLord Minto had in view, his attitude has certainly been most successful,\r\nfor Lord Morley has repeatedly testified to the loyalty and cordiality\r\nwith which the Viceroy has constantly co-operated with him. That the\r\nSecretary of State and the Viceroy have, nevertheless, not always seen\r\neye to eye with regard to the interference of the India Office in the\r\ndetails of Indian administration appears clearly from a telegram read\r\nout by Lord Morley himself in the House of Lords on February 23, 1909.\r\nIn the course of this telegram, which acknowledged in the most generous\r\nterms the strong support of the Secretary of State in all dealings with\r\nsedition, the Viceroy made the following curious admission:--\"The\r\nquestion of the control of Indian administration by the Secretary of\r\nState, mixed up as it is with the old difficulties of centralization, we\r\nmay very possibly look at from different points of view.\" The curtain\r\nfell upon this restrained attempt to assert what Lord Minto evidently\r\nregarded eighteen months ago as his legitimate position, and to the\r\npublic eye it has not been raised again since then. But in India\r\ncertainly the fear is often expressed in responsible quarters that,\r\nnotwithstanding the courageous support which Lord Morley has given to\r\nlegislative measures for dealing with the worst forms of seditious\r\nagitation, their effect has been occasionally weakened by that\r\ninterference from home in the details of Indian administration of which\r\nLord Minto's telegram contains the only admission known to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe that Lord Minto's position would not have\r\nbeen stronger had he not allowed the Governor-General in Council to\r\nsuffer such frequent eclipses. The Governor-General's Council during\r\nLord Minto's tenure of office may have been exceptionally weak, and\r\nthere will always be a serious element of weakness in it so long as\r\nmembership of Council is not recognized to be the crowning stage of an\r\nIndian career. So long as it is, as at present too frequently happens,\r\nmerely a stepping-stone to a Lieutenant-Governorship, it is idle to\r\nexpect that the hope of advancement will not sometimes act as a\r\nrestraint upon the independence and sense of individual responsibility\r\nwhich a seat in Council demands. In any case, the effacement of Council\r\nduring the last few years behind the Viceroy has not been calculated to\r\ndispel the widespread impression that, both in Calcutta and in\r\nWhitehall, there has been a tendency to substitute for the\r\nconstitutional relations between the Governor-General in Council and the\r\nSecretary of State in Council more informal and personal relations\r\nbetween Lord Minto and Lord Morley, which, however excellent, are\r\ndifficult to reconcile with the principles essential to the maintenance\r\nof a strong Government of India. Private letters and private telegrams\r\nare very useful helps to a mutual understanding, but they cannot safely\r\nsupplant, or encroach upon, the more formal and regular methods of\r\ncommunication, officially recorded for future reference, in consultation\r\nand concert with the Councils on either side, as by statute established.\r\n\r\nThere is a twofold danger in any eclipse, even partial, of the\r\nGovernor-General in Council. One of the remarks I have heard most\r\nfrequently all over India, and from Indians as well as from Englishmen,\r\nis that \"there is no longer any Government of India\"; and it is a remark\r\nwhich, however exaggerated in form, contains a certain element of truth.\r\nTo whatever extent the Viceroy, in his relations with Whitehall,\r\ndetaches himself from his Council, to that extent the centre of\r\nexecutive stability is displaced and the door is opened to that constant\r\ninterference from home in the details of Indian administration which is\r\nall the more to be deprecated if there appear to be any suspicion of\r\nparty pressure. Lord Morley has so often and so courageously stood up\r\nfor sound principles of Indian government against the fierce attacks of\r\nthe extreme wing of his party, and he has shown, on the whole, so much\r\nmoderation and insight in his larger schemes of constructive\r\nstatesmanship, whilst Lord Minto has won for himself so much personal\r\nregard during a very difficult period, that criticism may appear\r\ninvidious. But the tone adopted, especially during the first years of\r\nLord Morley's administration, in official replies to insidious\r\nParliamentary questions aimed at Indian administrators, the alacrity\r\nwith which they were transmitted from the India Office to Calcutta, the\r\nacquiescence with which they were received there, and the capital made\r\nout of them by political agitators when they were spread broadcast over\r\nIndia contributed largely to undermine the principle of authority upon\r\nwhich, as Lord Morley has himself admitted, Indian government must rest.\r\nFor the impression was thus created in India that there was no detail of\r\nIndian administration upon which an appeal might not be successfully\r\nmade through Parliament to the Secretary of State over the head of the\r\nGovernment of India. Now if, as Lord Morley has also admitted,\r\nParliamentary government is inconceivable in India, it is equally\r\ninconceivable that Indian government can be carried on under a running\r\nfire of malevolent or ignorant criticism from a Parliament 6,000 miles\r\naway. That is certainly not the sort of Parliamentary control\r\ncontemplated in the legislative enactments which guarantee the \"ultimate\r\nresponsibility\" of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the effacement of the Viceroy's Executive Council has\r\nweakened that collective authority of the Government of India without\r\nwhich its voice must fail to carry full weight in Whitehall. Every\r\nexperienced Anglo-Indian administrator, for instance, had been quick to\r\nrealize what were bound to be the consequences of the unbridled licence\r\nof the extremist Press and of an openly seditious propaganda. Yet the\r\nGovernment of India under Lord Minto lacked the cohesion necessary to\r\nsecure the sanction of the Secretary of State to adequate legislative\r\naction, repugnant to party traditions at home, until we had already\r\nbegun to reap the bloody harvest of an exaggerated tolerance, and with\r\nthe Viceroy himself the views of the ruling chiefs seem to have carried\r\ngreater weight in urging action on the Secretary of State than the\r\nopinions recorded at a much earlier date by men entitled to his\r\nconfidence and entrusted under his orders with the administration of\r\nBritish India.\r\n\r\nEven if one could always be certain of having men of transcendent\r\nability at the India Office and at Government House in Calcutta, it is\r\nimpossible that they should safely dispense with the permanent\r\ncorrective to their personal judgment and temperament--not to speak of\r\noutside pressure--which their respective Councils have been created by\r\nlaw to supply. Let us take first of all the case of the Viceroy. His\r\nposition as the head of the Government of India may be likened to that\r\nof the Prime Minister at home, and the position of the Viceroy's\r\nExecutive Council to that of the Ministers who, as heads of the\r\nprincipal executive Departments, form the Cabinet over which the Prime\r\nMinister presides. But no head of the Executive at home stands so much\r\nin need of capable and experienced advisers as the Viceroy, who\r\ngenerally goes out to India without any personal knowledge of the vast\r\nsub-continent and the 300 million people whom he is sent out to govern\r\nfor five years with very far-reaching powers, and often without any\r\nadministrative experience, though he has to take charge of the most\r\ncomplicated administrative machine in the world. Even when he has gone\r\nout to India, his opportunities of getting to know the country and its\r\npeoples are actually very scant. He spends more than six months of the\r\nyear at Simla, an essentially European and ultra-official hill-station\r\nperched up in the clouds and entirely out of touch with Indian life, and\r\nanother four months he spends in Calcutta, which, again, is only\r\npartially Indian, or, at any rate, presents but one aspect of the\r\nmany-sided life of India. It takes a month for the great public\r\ndepartments to transport themselves and their archives from Calcutta to\r\nSimla at the beginning of the hot weather, and another month in the\r\nautumn for the pilgrimage back from the hills to Calcutta. It is only\r\nduring these two months that the Viceroy can travel about freely and\r\nmake himself acquainted with other parts of the vast Dependency\r\ncommitted to his care, and, though railways have shortened distances,\r\nrapid journeys in special trains with great ceremonial programmes at\r\nevery halting point scarcely afford the same opportunities as the more\r\nleisurely progress of olden days, when the Governor-General's camp, as\r\nit moved from place to place, was open to visitors from the whole\r\nsurrounding country. Moreover, the machinery of administration grows\r\nevery year more ponderous and complicated, and the Viceroy, unless he is\r\nendowed with an almost superhuman power and quickness of work, is apt to\r\nfind himself entangled in the meshes of never-ending routine. It is in\r\norder to supply the knowledge and experience which a Viceroy in most\r\ncases lacks when he first goes out, and in some cases is never able to\r\nacquire during his whole tenure of office, that his Executive Council is\r\nso constituted, in theory and as far as possible in practice, that it\r\ncombines with administrative experience in the several Departments over\r\nwhich members respectively preside such a knowledge collectively of the\r\nwhole of India that the Viceroy can rely upon expert advice and\r\nassistance in the transaction of public business and, not least, in\r\napplying with due regard for Indian conditions the principles of policy\r\nlaid down for his guidance by the Home Government. These were the\r\ngrounds upon which Lord Morley justified the appointment to the\r\nViceroy's Executive Council of an Indian member who, besides being\r\nthoroughly qualified to take charge of the special portfolio entrusted\r\nto him, would bring into Council a special and intimate knowledge of\r\nnative opinion and sentiment. These are the grounds upon which, by the\r\nway, Lord Morley cannot possibly justify the appointment of Mr. Clark as\r\nMember for Commerce and Industry, for a young subordinate official,\r\nhowever brilliant, of an English public Department cannot bring into the\r\nViceroy's Executive Council either special or general knowledge of\r\nIndian affairs. Such an appointment must to that extent weaken rather\r\nthan strengthen the Government of India.\r\n\r\nThe same arguments which apply in India to the conjunction of the\r\nGovernor-General with his Council apply, _mutatis mutandis_, with\r\nscarcely less force to the importance of the part assigned to the\r\nCouncil of India as advisers of the Secretary of State at the India\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the Morley-Minto _régime_ from another point of view, it\r\nis passing strange that the tendency to concentrate the direction of\r\naffairs in India in the hands of the Viceroy and to subject the Viceroy\r\nin turn to the closer and more immediate control of the Secretary of\r\nState, whilst simultaneously diminishing _pro tanto_ the influence of\r\ntheir respective Councils, should have manifested itself just at this\r\ntime, when it is Lord Morley who presides over the India Office. For no\r\nstatesman has ever proclaimed a more ardent belief in the virtues of\r\ndecentralization than Lord Morley, and Lord Morley himself is largely\r\nresponsible for legislative reforms which will not only strengthen the\r\nhands of the provincial Governments in their dealings with the\r\nGovernment of India, but will enable and, indeed, force the Government\r\nof India to assume on many vital questions an attitude of increased\r\nindependence towards the Imperial Government. The more we are determined\r\nto govern India in accordance with Indian ideas and with Indian\r\ninterests, the more we must rely upon a strong, intelligent, and\r\nself-reliant Government of India. The peculiar conditions of India\r\nexclude the possibility of Indian self-government on colonial lines, but\r\nwhat we may, and probably must, look forward to at no distant date is\r\nthat, with the larger share in legislation and administration secured to\r\nIndians by such measures as the Indian Councils Act, the Government of\r\nIndia will speak with growing authority as the exponent of the best\r\nIndian opinion within the limits compatible with the maintenance of\r\nBritish rule, and that its voice will therefore ultimately carry\r\nscarcely less weight at home in the determination of Indian policy than\r\nthe voice of our self-governing Dominions already carries in all\r\nquestions concerning their internal development.\r\n\r\nThe future of India lies in the greatest possible decentralization in\r\nIndia subject to the general, but unmeddlesome, control of the\r\nGovernor-General in Council, and in the greatest possible freedom of the\r\nGovernment of India from all interference from home, except in regard to\r\nthose broad principles of policy which it must always rest with the\r\nImperial Government, represented by the Secretary of State in Council,\r\nto determine. It is only in that way that, to use one of Mr. Montagu's\r\nphrases, we can hope successfully to \"yoke\" to our own \"democratic\"\r\nsystem \"a Government so complex and irresponsible to the peoples which\r\nit governs as the Government of India.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Viceroy has for fifty years gone out to India at so critical a moment\r\nas that at which Lord Hardinge of Penshurst is about to take up the\r\nreins of government. In one respect only is he more favoured than most\r\nof his predecessors. The Anglo-Russian agreement, of which he himself\r\nhelped to lay the foundations when he was Ambassador at St. Petersburg,\r\nhas removed the greatest of all the dangers that threatened the external\r\nsecurity of India and the peace of Central Asia during the greater part\r\nof the nineteenth century. It does not, however, follow that the\r\nGovernment of India can look forward with absolute confidence to\r\ncontinued immunity from all external troubles. Save for the Tibetan\r\nexpedition and one or two small punitive expeditions against Pathan\r\ntribes, there have been no military operations on the Indian frontier\r\nsince the Terai campaign was brought to a close in 1898. But signs are,\r\nunfortunately, not wanting of a serious recrudescence of restlessness on\r\nthe North-West Frontier, where the very necessary measures taken to cut\r\noff supplies of arms from the Persian Gulf have contributed to stimulate\r\nthe chronic turbulence of the unruly tribesmen. There is no definite\r\nevidence at present that they are receiving direct encouragement from\r\nCabul, but it is at least doubtful whether the somewhat exaggerated\r\ndeference shown to the Ameer on the occasion of his visit three years\r\nago to India has permanently improved our relations with him, and though\r\nhe is no longer able to play off Russia and England against each other,\r\nhe has not yet brought himself to signify his adhesion to the Convention\r\nwhich defined our understanding with Russia in regard to Afghan affairs.\r\nThe condition of Persia, and especially of the southern provinces, has\r\ncreated a situation which cannot be indefinitely tolerated, whilst the\r\nprovocative temper displayed by the Turkish authorities under the new\r\n_régime_ at various points on the Persian Gulf is only too well\r\ncalculated to produce unpleasant complications, however anxious we must\r\nbe to avoid them, if only in view of the feeling which any estrangement\r\nbetween Mahomedan Powers and Great Britain inevitably produces amongst\r\nIndian Moslems. The high-handed action of China in Tibet, and, indeed,\r\nall along the north-eastern borderland of our Indian Empire, has\r\nintroduced a fresh element of potential trouble which the Government of\r\nIndia cannot safely disregard, for we are bound not only to protect our\r\nown frontiers, but also to safeguard the interests of Nepal and Bhutan,\r\nwhere, as well as in Sikkim, the fate of Tibet and the flight of the\r\nDalai Lama have caused no slight perturbation. In Nepal especially,\r\nwhich is one of the most valuable recruiting grounds of the Indian Army,\r\nChinese ascendency cannot be allowed to overshadow British influence.\r\nLord Hardinge is by profession a peacemaker, and how efficient a\r\npeacemaker he proved himself to be at St. Petersburg during the\r\nRusso-Japanese war will only be fully known when the historian has\r\naccess to the secret records of that critical period of Anglo-Russian\r\nrelations. But it must not be forgotten that the maintenance of peace\r\nalong such a vast and still largely unsettled borderland as that of\r\nIndia may at any moment be frustrated by disturbing forces over which\r\nthe most peacefully disposed Viceroy has little or no control.\r\n\r\nPeace and sound finance, which is inseparable from peace, have certainly\r\nnever been more essential to India than at the present juncture. For\r\nwithout them the difficulty of solving the most absorbing and urgent of\r\nthe internal problems of India will be immeasurably enhanced. There is a\r\nlull in the storm of unrest, but after the repeated disappointments to\r\nwhich official optimism has been subjected within the last few years, he\r\nwould be a sanguine prophet who would venture to assert that this lull\r\npresages a permanent return to more normal conditions. Has the creation\r\nof a new political machinery which gives a vastly enlarged scope to the\r\nactivities of Indian constitutional reformers, definitely rallied the\r\nwaverers and restored courage and confidence to the representatives of\r\nsober and law-abiding opinion, or will they continue to follow the lead\r\nof impatient visionaries clamouring, as Lord Morley once put it, for the\r\nmoon which we cannot give them? Have the forces of aggressive\r\ndisaffection been actually disarmed by the so-called measures of\r\n\"repression,\" or have they merely been compelled for the time being to\r\ncover their tracks and modify their tactics, until the relaxation of\r\nofficial vigilance or the play of party politics in England or some\r\ngreat international crisis opens up a fresh opportunity for militant\r\nsedition? To these momentous questions the next five years will\r\ndoubtless go far to furnish a conclusive answer, and it will be\r\ndetermined in no small measure by the statesmanship, patience, and\r\nfirmness which Lord Hardinge will bring to the discharge of the\r\nconstitutional functions assigned to him as Viceroy--i.e., as the\r\npersonal representative of the King Emperor, and as Governor-General in\r\nCouncil--i.e., as the head of the Government of India.\r\n\r\nI have attempted, however imperfectly, to trace to their sources some of\r\nthe chief currents and cross-currents of the great confused movement\r\nwhich is stirring the stagnant waters of Indian life--the steady impact\r\nof alien ideas on an ancient and obsolescent civilization; the more or\r\nless imperfect assimilation of those ideas by the few; the dread and\r\nresentment of them by those whose traditional ascendency they threaten;\r\nthe disintegration of old beliefs, and then again their aggressive\r\nrevival; the careless diffusion of an artificial system of education,\r\nbased none too firmly on mere intellectualism, and bereft of all moral\r\nor religious sanction; the application of Western theories of\r\nadministration and of jurisprudence to a social formation stratified on\r\nlines of singular rigidity; the play of modern economic forces upon\r\nprimitive conditions of industry and trade; the constant and unconscious\r\nbut inevitable friction between subject races and their alien rulers;\r\nthe reverberation of distant wars and distant racial conflicts; the\r\nexaltation of an Oriental people in the Far East; the abasement of\r\nAsiatics in South Africa--all these and many other conflicting\r\ninfluences culminating in the inchoate revolt of a small but very active\r\nminority which, on the one hand, frequently disguises under an appeal to\r\nthe example and sympathy of Western democracy a reversion to the old\r\ntyranny of caste and to the worst superstitions of Hinduism, and, on the\r\nother hand, arms, with the murderous methods of Western Anarchism, the\r\nfervour of Eastern mysticism compounded in varying proportions of\r\nphilosophic transcendentalism and degenerate sensuousness.\r\n\r\nIn so far as this movement is directed to the immediate subversion of\r\nBritish rule, we need not exaggerate its importance, unless the British\r\nEmpire were involved in serious complications elsewhere which might\r\nencourage the seditious elements in India to break out into open\r\nrebellion. We are too often, in fact, inclined to underrate the strength\r\nof the foundations upon which our rule rests. For it alone lends--and\r\ncan within any measurable time lend--substantial reality to the mere\r\ngeographical expression which India is. A few Indians may dream of a\r\nunited India under Indian rule, but the dream is as wild to-day as that\r\nof the few European Socialists who dream of the United States of Europe.\r\nIndia has never approached to political unity any more than Europe has,\r\nexcept under the compulsion of a conqueror. For India and Europe are\r\nthus far alike that they are both geographically self-contained\r\ncontinents, but inhabited by a great variety of nations whose different\r\nracial and religious affinities, whose different customs and traditions,\r\ntend to divide them far more than any interests they may have in common\r\ntend to unite them. We have got too much into the habit of talking about\r\nIndia and the Indians as if they were one country and one people, and we\r\ntoo often forget that there are far more absolutely distinct languages\r\nspoken in India than in Europe; that there are far more profound racial\r\ndifferences between the Mahratta and the Bengalee than between the\r\nGerman and the Portuguese, or between the Punjabee and the Tamil than\r\nbetween the Russian and the Italian; that, not to speak of other creeds,\r\nthe religious antagonism between Hindu and Mahomedan is often more\r\nactive than any that exists to-day between Protestants and Roman\r\nCatholics, even, let us say, in Ulster; and that caste has driven into\r\nIndian society lines of far deeper cleavage than any class distinctions\r\nthat have survived in Europe.\r\n\r\nWe do not rule India, as is sometimes alleged, by playing off one race\r\nor one creed against another and by accentuating and fostering these\r\nancient divisions, but we are able to rule because our rule alone\r\nprevents these ancient divisions from breaking out once more into open\r\nand sanguinary strife. British rule is the form of government that\r\ndivides Indians the least. The majority of intelligent and sober-minded\r\nIndians who have a stake in the country welcome it and support it\r\nbecause they feel it to be the only safeguard against the clash of rival\r\nraces and creeds, which would ultimately lead to the oppressive\r\nascendency of some one race or creed; and the great mass of the\r\npopulation yield to it an inarticulate and instinctive acquiescence\r\nbecause it gives them a greater measure of security, justice, and\r\ntranquillity than their forbears ever enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThere are only two forces that aspire to substitute themselves for\r\nBritish rule, or at least to make the continuance of British rule\r\nsubservient to their own ascendency. One is the ancient and reactionary\r\nforce of Brahmanism, which, having its roots in the social and religious\r\nsystem we call Hinduism, operates upon a very large section--but still\r\nonly a section--of the population who are Hindus. The other is a modern\r\nand, in its essence, progressive force generated by Western education,\r\nwhich operates to some extent over the whole area of India, but only\r\nupon an infinitesimal fraction of the population recruited among a few\r\nprivileged castes. Its only real _nexus_ is a knowledge, often very\r\nsuperficial, of the English language and of English political\r\ninstitutions. Though both these forces have developed of late years a\r\nspirit of revolt against British rule, neither of them has in itself\r\nsufficient substance to be dangerous. The one is too old, the other too\r\nyoung. But the most rebellious elements in both have effected a\r\ntemporary and unnatural alliance on the basis of an illusory\r\n\"Nationalism\" which appeals to nothing in Indian history, but is\r\ncalculated and meant to appeal with dangerous force to Western sentiment\r\nand ignorance.\r\n\r\nIt rests with us to break up that unnatural alliance. We may not\r\nreconcile aggressive Brahmanism to Western civilization, but we can\r\ncombat the evil influences for which it stands and which many\r\nenlightened Brahmans have long since recognized; and we can combat them\r\nmost effectively by rallying to our side the better and more progressive\r\nelements which, in spite of its many imperfections, Western education\r\nand the contact with Western civilization have already produced. To that\r\nend we must shrink from no sacrifices to improve our methods of\r\neducation. The evils for which we have to find remedies have been of\r\nslow growth, and they can only be slowly cured. But they can be cured by\r\npatient and sustained effort, and by carrying courageously into practice\r\nthe principle, which none of us will challenge in theory, that the\r\nformation of character on a sound moral basis, inseparable in India from\r\na sound religious basis, is at least as important a part of the\r\neducational process as the development of the intellect.\r\n\r\nThat, however, is not all. If we are to save and to foster the better\r\nelements, we must stamp out the worse. Do not let us be frightened by\r\nmere words. To talk, as some do, of the Indian Press being \"gagged\" by\r\nthe new Press Act is absurd. It is as free to-day as it has always been\r\nto criticize Government as fully and fearlessly, and, one may add, often\r\nas unjustly, as party newspapers in this country are wont to criticize\r\nthe Government of the day. It is no longer free to preach revolution and\r\nmurder with the cynical audacity shown in some of the quotations I have\r\ngiven various Nationalist organs. \"Repression\" in India, whether of the\r\nseditious press, or of secret societies, or of unlawful meetings, means\r\nnothing more cruel or oppressive than the application of surgery to\r\ndiseased growths which threaten to infect the whole organism--and\r\nespecially so immature and sensitive an organism as the\r\nsemi-Westernized, semi-educated section of Indian society to-day\r\nrepresents. This surgical treatment will probably also have to be\r\npatient and sustained, for here too we have to deal with evils of no\r\nsudden growth, though some of their worst outward manifestations have\r\ncome suddenly upon us. Even if the improvement be more rapid than we\r\nhave any right to expect, do not let us throw away our surgical\r\ninstruments, but rather preserve them against any possible relapse. We\r\nhave to remember not only what we owe to ourselves, but what we owe\r\nequally to the many well-meaning but timid Indians who look to us for\r\nprotection against the insidious forms of terrorism to which the\r\ndisaffected minority can subject them[24]. The number of our active\r\nenemies may be few, but great is the number of our friends who are of\r\nopinion that we are more anxious to conciliate the one sinner who may or\r\nmay not repent than to encourage the 99 just who persevere.\r\n\r\nWe want the Western-educated Indian. We have made him, and we cannot\r\nunmake him if we would. But we must see that he is a genuine product of\r\nthe best that Western education can give, and not merely an Indian who\r\ncan speak English and adapt his speech to English ears in order to lend\r\nplausibility to the revival in new forms of ancient religious or social\r\ntyrannies. We must remember also that even the best type of\r\nWestern-educated Indian only speaks at present for a minute section of\r\nthe population of India, and that, when he does not speak, as he often\r\nnaturally does, merely in the interests of the small class which he\r\nrepresents, he has not yet by any means proved his title to speak for\r\nthe scores of millions of his fellow-countrymen who are still living in\r\nthe undisturbed atmosphere of the Indian Middle Ages. One of the dangers\r\nwe have to guard against is that, because the Western-educated Indian is\r\nto the stay-at-home Englishman, and even to the Englishman whose\r\nsuperficial knowledge of India is confined to brief visits to the chief\r\ncities of India, the most, and indeed the only, articulate Indian, we\r\nshould regard him as the only or the most authoritative mouthpiece of\r\nthe needs and wishes of other classes or of the great mass of his\r\nfellow-countrymen with whom he is often in many ways in less close touch\r\nthan the Englishman who lives in their midst.\r\n\r\nThe weak point of the recent political reforms is that they were\r\nintended to benefit, not wholly, but mainly, that particular class. In\r\nso far as they may help to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the\r\nmoderate Indian politician they deserve praise; and in that respect, as\r\nfar as one can judge at this very early stage, they are not without\r\npromise. In effect they have also helped to give other important\r\ninterests opportunities of organization and expression. Apart from the\r\ngreat Mahomedan community, whose political aspirations are largely\r\ndifferent from, and opposed to, those of Hinduism, there are\r\nagricultural interests, always of supreme importance in such a country\r\nas India, and industrial and commercial interests of growing importance\r\nwhich cannot be adequately represented by the average Indian politician\r\nwho is chiefly recruited from the towns and from, professions that have\r\nlittle or no knowledge of or sympathy with them. The politician, for\r\ninstance, is too often a lawyer, and he has thriven upon a system of\r\njurisprudence and legal procedure which we have imported into India with\r\nthe best intentions, but with results that have sometimes been simply\r\ndisastrous to a thriftless and litigious people. Hence the suspicion and\r\ndislike entertained by large numbers of quiet, respectable Indians for\r\nany political institutions that tend to increase the influence of the\r\nIndian _vakeel_ and of the class he represents. Our object, therefore,\r\nboth in the education and in the political training of Indians, should\r\nbe to divert the activities of the new Western-educated classes into\r\neconomic channels which would broaden their own horizon, and to give\r\ngreater encouragement and recognition to the interests of the very large\r\nand influential classes that hold entirely aloof from politics but look\r\nto us for guidance and help in the development of the material resources\r\nof the country. We have their support at present, but to retain it we\r\nmust carefully avoid creating the impression that political agitation is\r\nthe only lever that acts effectively upon Government, and that in the\r\nrelations of India and Great Britain--and especially in their fiscal and\r\nfinancial relations--the exigencies of party politics at home and the\r\nmaterial interests of the predominant partner must invariably prevail.\r\n\r\nWhilst, subject to the maintenance of effective executive control, we\r\nhave extended and must continue steadily to extend the area of civil\r\nemployment for Indians in the service of the State, there would\r\ncertainly seem to be room also for affording them increased\r\nopportunities of military employment. It is a strange anomaly that, at a\r\ntime when we have no hesitation in introducing Indians into our\r\nExecutive Councils, those who serve the King-Emperor in the Indian Army\r\ncan only rise to quite subordinate rank. A good deal has no doubt been\r\ndone to improve the quality of the native officer from the point of view\r\nof military education, but, under present conditions, the Indian Army\r\ndoes not offer a career that can attract Indians of good position,\r\nthough it is just among the landed aristocracy and gentry of India that\r\nmilitary traditions are combined with the strongest traditions of\r\nloyalty. By the creation of an Imperial Cadet Corps Lord Curzon took a\r\nstep in the right direction which was warmly welcomed at the time, but\r\nhas received very little encouragement since his departure from India.\r\nSomething more than that seems to be wanted to-day. Some of the best\r\nmilitary opinion in India favours, I believe, an experimental scheme for\r\nthe gradual promotion of native officers, carefully selected and\r\ntrained, to field rank in a certain number of regiments which would\r\nultimately be entirely officered by Indians--just in the same way as a\r\ncertain number of regiments in the Egyptian Army have always been wholly\r\nofficered by Egyptians. Indeed, we need not go outside India to find\r\neven now, in the Native States, Indian forces exclusively officered by\r\nIndians. The effect upon the whole Native Army of some such measure as I\r\nhave indicated would be excellent; and though we could never hope to\r\nretain India merely by the sword against the combined hostility of its\r\nvarious peoples, the Native Army must always be a factor of first-rate\r\nimportance, both for the prevention and the repression of any spasmodic\r\noutbreak of revolt. It is no secret that reiterated attempts have been\r\nmade to shake its loyalty, and in some isolated cases not altogether\r\nwithout success. But the most competent authorities, whilst admitting\r\nthe need for vigilance, deprecate any serious alarm, and it is all to\r\nthe good that British officers no longer indulge in the blind optimism\r\nwhich prevailed among those of the old Sepoy regiments before the\r\nMutiny.\r\n\r\nOne point which Englishmen are apt to forget, and which has been rather\r\nlost sight of In the recent political reforms, is that more than a fifth\r\nof the population of our Indian Empire--about one third of its total\r\narea--is under the direct administration not of the Government of India,\r\nbut of the Ruling Chiefs. They represent great traditions and great\r\ninterests, which duty and statesmanship equally forbid us to ignore. The\r\ncreation of an Imperial Council, in which they would have sat with\r\nrepresentatives of the Indian aristocracy of British India, was an\r\nimportant feature of the original scheme of reforms proposed by the\r\nGovernment of India. It was abandoned for reasons of which I am not\r\nconcerned to dispute the validity. But the idea underlying it was\r\nunquestionably sound, and Lord Minto acted upon it when he drew the\r\nRuling Chiefs into consultation as to the prevention of sedition. Some\r\nmeans will have to be found to embody it in a more regular and permanent\r\nshape. If we were to attempt to introduce what are called democratic\r\nmethods into the government of British India without seeking the\r\nadhesion and support of the feudatory Princes, we should run a grave\r\nrisk of estranging one of the most loyal and conservative forces in the\r\nIndian Empire. The administrative autonomy of the native States is\r\nsometimes put forward as an argument in favour of the self-government\r\nwhich Indian politicians demand. It Is an argument based on complete\r\nignorance. With one or two exceptions, far more apparent than real, the\r\nNative States are governed by patriarchal methods, which may be\r\nthoroughly suited to the traditions and needs of their subjects, but are\r\nmuch further removed than the methods of government in British India\r\nfrom the professed aspirations of the Indian National Congress. Just as\r\nthe Ruling Chiefs rightly complained of the effect upon their own people\r\nof the seditious literature imported into their States from British\r\nIndia before we were at last induced to check the output of the\r\n\"extremist\" Press, so they would be justified in resenting any grave\r\npolitical changes in British India which would react dangerously upon\r\ntheir own position and their relations with their own subjects. When we\r\ntalk of governing India in accordance with Indian ideas, we cannot\r\nexclude the ideas of the very representative and influential class of\r\nIndians to which none are better qualified to give expression than the\r\nRuling Chiefs. One further suggestion. The policy of annexation has long\r\nsince been abandoned, and the question to-day is whether we might not go\r\nfurther and give ruling powers to a few great chiefs of approved loyalty\r\nand high character, who possess in British India estates more populous\r\nand important than those of many whom we have always recognized as\r\nRuling Chiefs. The objections to so novel a departure are, I know,\r\nserious, and may be overwhelming--foremost among them being the\r\nreluctance hitherto shown by the people themselves whenever, for\r\npurposes of administrative convenience, any slight readjustment of\r\nboundaries has been proposed that involved the transfer to a native\r\nState of even a few villages until then under British Administration.\r\n\r\nThe political reforms with which Lord Minto's Viceroyalty will remain\r\nidentified are only just on their trial. All that can safely be said at\r\npresent is that they are full of promise, and it would be rash to\r\npredict whether and when it may be safe to proceed further in the\r\ndirection to which, they point. It is difficult even to say yet awhile\r\nwhat share they have had, independently of the \"repressive\" measures\r\nthat accompanied them, in stemming at least temporarily the tide of\r\nactive sedition. Time is required to mature their fruits whether for\r\ngood or for evil. One may hope that, though they address themselves\r\nonly to the political elements of the present unrest, they will tend to\r\nfacilitate the treatment of the economic and social factors of the\r\nIndian problem. It is these that now chiefly and most urgently claim the\r\nattention of the British rulers of India. To rescue education from its\r\npresent unhealthy surroundings and to raise it on to a higher plane\r\nwhilst making it more practical, to promote the industrial and\r\ncommercial expansion of India so as to open up new fields for the\r\nintellectual activity of educated Indians, to strengthen the old ties\r\nand to create new ones that shall bind the ancient conservative as well\r\nas the modern progressive forces of Indian society to the British _Raj_\r\nby an enlightened sense of self-interest are slower and more arduous\r\ntasks and demand more patient and sustained statesmanship than any\r\nadventures in constitutional changes. But it is only by the successful\r\nachievement of such tasks that we can expect to retain the loyal\r\nacquiescence of the Princes and peoples of India in the maintenance of\r\nBritish rule.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of reverence for the Crown is widespread and deep-rooted\r\namong all races and creeds in India[25]. It is perhaps the one tradition\r\ncommon to all. It went out spontaneously to Queen Victoria, whose length\r\nof years and widowed isolation appealed with a peculiar sense of lofty\r\nand pathetic dignity to the imagination of her Indian peoples. It has\r\nbeen materially reinforced by the pride of personal acquaintance, since\r\nIndia has been twice honoured with the presence of the immediate\r\nsuccessor to the Throne. The late King's visit to India has not yet\r\nfaded from the memory of the older generation, and that of the present\r\nKing-Emperor and his gracious Consort is, of course, still fresh in the\r\nrecollection of all. How powerful is the hold which the majesty of the\r\nCrown exercises upon Princes and peoples in India was very strikingly\r\nshown by the calming effect, however temporary, which the presence of\r\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales had in Bengal four years ago, at the\r\nvery moment when political agitation in that province was developing\r\ninto almost open sedition; and it was shown once more this year by the\r\nhush of subdued grief that passed over the whole of India at the sudden\r\nnews of King Edward's death. Only such rabid papers as Tilak's old\r\norgan, the _Kesari_, ventured an attempt to counteract the deep\r\nimpression produced by that lamentable event, and it could only attempt\r\nto do so, very ineffectively, by a spiteful and ignorant depreciation of\r\nthe position and personality of the Sovereign, and of the part played by\r\nhim in a Western democracy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the traditional prestige attaching to the Crown, we cannot,\r\nhowever, reasonably look for loyalty from India in the sense in which we\r\nlook for it from our own people or from our kinsmen beyond the seas.\r\nThere can never be between Englishmen and Indians the same community of\r\nhistorical traditions, of racial affinity, of social institutions, of\r\ncustoms and beliefs that exists between people of our own stock\r\nthroughout the British Empire. The absence of these sentimental bonds,\r\nwhich cannot be artificially forged, makes it impossible that we should\r\never concede to India the rights of self-government which we have\r\nwillingly conceded to the great British communities of our own race. And\r\nthere is another and scarcely less cogent reason. The justification of\r\nour presence in India is that it gives peace and security to all the\r\nvarious races and creeds which make up one-fifth of the population of\r\nthis globe. To introduce self-government into India would necessarily be\r\nto hand it over to the ascendency of the strongest. That we are debarred\r\nfrom doing by the very terms on which we hold India, and that is what\r\nLord Morley must have had in his mind, when, in supporting the Indian\r\nCouncils Act last year, he specifically excluded all possibility of such\r\nassemblies ever leading to the establishment of Parliamentary government\r\nin India. The sooner that is made perfectly clear the better. But just\r\nbecause executive self-government is inconceivable in India so long as\r\nBritish rule is maintained, we must recognize the special\r\nresponsibility that consequently devolves upon us not only to do many\r\nthings for India which we do not attempt to do for our self-governing\r\nDominions, but, above all, not to force upon India things which we\r\nshould not dream of forcing upon them, and especially in matters in\r\nwhich British material interests may appear to be closely concerned. We\r\nmust continue to govern India as the greatest of the dependencies of the\r\nBritish Crown, but we must do our utmost to satisfy Indians of all\r\nclasses and castes and beliefs that we govern them as none of their race\r\ncould govern them, with an equal and absolutely impartial regard for all\r\nlaw-abiding communities, with an intelligent appreciation of their\r\npeculiar interests, and with genuine consideration for all their ideas,\r\nso long as those ideas are compatible with the maintenance and security\r\nof British rule.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe retirement of Lord Morley has been announced just as these last\r\npages are going to press. The announcement has been received with\r\ngenuine and widespread regret at home, where criticism of certain\r\ndetails and aspects of his administration has never detracted from a\r\ngenuine recognition of the lofty sense of duty and broad and courageous\r\nstatesmanship which he has displayed throughout a very critical period\r\nin the history of our Indian Empire. It will assuredly be received with\r\nthe same feeling in India by all those who have at heart the destinies\r\nof the British _Raj_ and the interests of the countless peoples\r\ncommitted to our charge. Lord Morley's tenure of office will remain for\r\nall times memorable in Anglo-Indian annals. He has set for the Indian\r\nship of State a new course upon which she will be kept with increasing\r\nconfidence in the future if we keep steadily before us the wise words\r\nwhich, with his own singular felicity of speech, he addressed two years\r\nago to the Indian Civil Service:--\"We have a clouded moment before us\r\nnow. We shall get through it--but only with self-command and without any\r\nquackery or cant, whether it be the quackery of blind violence disguised\r\nas love of order, or the cant of unsound and misapplied sentiment,\r\ndivorced from knowledge and untouched by any cool consideration of\r\nfacts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nNOTE 1.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVE PRESS.\r\n\r\nNot a single Indian member of the Imperial Council made any serious\r\nattempt to controvert the following description given by Sir Herbert\r\nRisley of the demoralization of the native Press when he introduced the\r\nnew Press Bill on February 4, 1910:--We see the most influential and\r\nwidely-read portion of the Indian Press incessantly occupied in\r\nrendering the Government by law established odious in the sight of the\r\nIndian people. The Government is foreign, and therefore selfish and\r\ntyrannical. It drains the country of its wealth; it has impoverished the\r\npeople, and brought about famine on a scale and with a frequency unknown\r\nbefore; its public works, roads, railways, and canals have generated\r\nmalaria; it has introduced plague, by poisoning wells, in order to\r\nreduce the population that has to be held in subjection it has deprived\r\nthe Indian peasant of his land; the Indian artisan of his industry, and\r\nthe Indian merchant of his trade; it has destroyed religion by its\r\ngodless system of education; it seeks to destroy caste by polluting\r\nmaliciously and of set purpose, the salt and sugar that men eat and the\r\ncloth that they wear; it allows Indians to be ill-treated in British\r\nColonies; it levies heavy taxes and spends them on the army; it pays\r\nhigh salaries to Englishmen, and employs Indians only in the worst paid\r\nposts--in short, it has enslaved a whole people, who are now struggling\r\nto be free.\r\n\r\nMy enumeration may not be exhaustive but these are some of the\r\nstatements that are now being implanted as axioms in the minds of rising\r\ngeneration of educated youths, the source from which we recruit the\r\ngreat body of civil officials who administer India. If nothing more were\r\nsaid, if the Press were content to--\r\n\r\n\"let the lie Have time on its own wings to fly\" things would be bad\r\nenough. But very much more is said. Every day the Press proclaims,\r\nopenly or by suggestion or allusion, that the only cure for the ills of\r\nIndia is independence from foreign rule, independence to be won by\r\nheroic deeds, self-sacrifice, martyrdom on the part of the young, in any\r\ncase by some form of violence. Hindu mythology, ancient and modern\r\nhistory, and more especially the European literature of revolution, are\r\nransacked to furnish examples that justify revolt and proclaim its\r\ninevitable success. The methods of guerilla warfare as practised in\r\nCircassia, Spain, and South Africa; Mazzini's gospel of political\r\nassassination; Kossuth's most violent doctrines; the doings of Russian\r\nNihilists; the murder of the Marquis Ito; the dialogue between Arjuna\r\nand Krishna in the \"Gita,\" a book that is to Hindus what the \"Imitation\r\nof Christ\" is to emotional Christians--all these are pressed into the\r\nservice of inflaming impressionable minds. The last instance is perhaps\r\nthe worst. I can imagine no more wicked desecration than that the\r\nsacrilegious hand of the Anarchist should be laid upon the Indian song\r\nof songs, and that a masterpiece of transcendental philosophy and\r\nreligious ecstasy should be perverted to the base uses of preaching\r\npolitical murder.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this ever-flowing stream of slander and incitement\r\nto outrage are now upon us. What was dimly foreseen a few years ago has\r\nactually come to pass. We are at the present moment confronted with a\r\nmurderous conspiracy, whose aim it is to subvert the Government of the\r\ncountry and to make British rule impossible by establishing general\r\nterrorism. Their organization is effective and far-reaching; their\r\nnumbers are believed to be considerable; the leaders work in secret and\r\nare blindly obeyed by their youthful followers. The method they favour\r\nat present is political assassination; the method of Mazzini in his\r\nworst moods. Already they have a long score of murders or attempted\r\nmurders to their account. There were two attempts to blow up Sir Andrew\r\nFraser's train and one, of the type with which we are now unhappily\r\nfamiliar, to shoot him on a public occasion. Two attempts were made to\r\nmurder Mr. Kingsford, one of which caused the death of two English\r\nladies. Inspector Nanda Lal Banerji, Babu Ashutosh Biswas, the Public\r\nProsecutor at Alipore, Sir William Curzon-Wyllie, Mr. Jackson, and only\r\nthe other day Deputy Supdt. Shams-ul-Alum have been shot in the most\r\ndeliberate and cold-blooded fashion. Of three informers two have been\r\nkilled, and on the third vengeance has been taken by the murder of his\r\nbrother in the sight of his mother and sisters. Mr. Allen, the\r\nmagistrate of Dacca, was shot through the lungs and narrowly escaped\r\nwith his life. Two picric acid bombs were thrown at His Excellency the\r\nViceroy at Ahmedabad, and only failed to explode by reason of their\r\nfaulty construction. Not long afterwards an attempt was made with a bomb\r\non the Deputy Commissioner of Umballa.\r\n\r\nThese things are the natural and necessary consequence of the teachings\r\nof certain journals. They have prepared the soil in which anarchy\r\nflourishes; they have sown the seed and they are answerable for the\r\ncrop. This is no mere general statement; the chain of causation is\r\nclear. Not only does the campaign of violence date from the change in\r\nthe tone of the Press, but specific outbursts of incitement have been\r\nfollowed by specific outrages.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, I appeal to the Council in the name of all objects that\r\npatriotic Indians have at heart to give their cordial approval to this\r\nBill. It is called for in the interests of the State, of our officers\r\nboth Indian and European, and most of all of the rising generation of\r\nyoung men. In this matter, indeed, the interests of the State and the\r\ninterests of the people are one and the same. If it is good for India\r\nthat British rule should continue, it is equally essential that the\r\nrelations between Government and the educated community should be\r\ncordial and intimate, and that cannot long be the case if the organs of\r\nthat community lay themselves out to embitter those relations in every\r\nsort of way and to create a permanent atmosphere of latent and often\r\nopen hostility. In the long run people will believe what they are told,\r\nif they are told it often enough, and if they hear nothing on the other\r\nside. There is plenty of work in India waiting to be done, but it will\r\nbe done, if the energies of the educated classes are wasted in incessant\r\nabuse and suspicion of Government. As regards the officers of Government\r\nthe case is clear. At all costs they must be protected from intimidation\r\nand worse. And it is our Indian officials who stand in most need of\r\nprotection, for they are most exposed to the danger. The detailed work\r\nof investigation and detection necessarily falls upon them, and they are\r\nspecially vulnerable through their families. They have done most\r\nadmirable work during the troubles of the last few years, and have\r\ndisplayed under most trying conditions courage and loyalty that are\r\nbeyond all praise. We are bound in honour to protect them from threats\r\nof murder and outrage which sooner or later bring about their own\r\nfulfilment.\r\n\r\nTo my mind, Sir, the worst feature of the present situation is the\r\nterrible influence that the Press exercises upon the student class. I\r\nwas talking about this about a month ago with a distinguished Indian who\r\nis in close touch with schools and colleges in Bengal. He took a most\r\ngloomy view of the present state of things and the prospects of the\r\nimmediate future. According to him the younger generation had got\r\nentirely out of hand, and many of them had become criminal fanatics\r\nuncontrollable by their parents or their masters.\r\n\r\nI believe. Sir, that this Bill will prove to be a wholesome and\r\nbeneficial measure of national education, that it will in course of time\r\nprevent a number of young men from drifting into evil courses and\r\nruining their prospects in life, and that in passing it this Council\r\nwill earn the lasting gratitude of many thousands of Indian parents.\r\n\r\nNOTE 2\r\n\r\nTHE SUPERIORITY OF HINDU CIVILIZATION. In an \"Open Letter to his\r\nCountrymen,\" published at the Sri Narayan Press in Calcutta, Mr.\r\nArabindo Ghose has in so many words proclaimed the superiority of Hindu\r\nto Western civilization. \"We reject,\" he writes, \"the claim of aliens to\r\nforce upon us a civilization inferior to our own or to keep us out of\r\nour inheritance on the untenable ground of a superior fitness.\"\r\n\r\nNOTE 3\r\n\r\nSEDITIOUS PLAYS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular of these plays is _The Killing of Kichaka\r\n(Kichaka-vadd)_. The author, Mr. Khadilkar, was assistant editor of the\r\n_Kesari_ until Tilak was arrested and convicted in 1908, and he then\r\ntook over the chief editorship. The play has been acted all over the\r\nDeccan as well as in Bombay City to houses packed with large native\r\naudiences. The following account of it appeared in _The Times_ of\r\nJanuary 18 last: Founded upon the Mahabharata, _The Killing of Kichaka_\r\nseems at first sight a purely classical drama. It will be remembered by\r\nOriental students that Duryodhan, jealous of his cousin Yudhistira,\r\nEmperor of Hastinapura and the eldest of the five Pandava brothers,\r\ninduced him to play at dice with a Court gambler called Sakuni. To him\r\nthe infatuated monarch lost his wealth, his kingdom, his own and his\r\nbrother's freedom, and lastly that of Draupadi, the wife of all the\r\nbrothers. Eventually, at the intercession of Duryodhan's father, it was\r\nagreed that the Emperor, in full settlement of his losses, should with\r\nhis brothers and Draupadi abandon Hastinapura to Duryodhan for 13 years.\r\nOf these 12 were to be spent in the forest and one in disguise in some\r\ndistant city. Should, however, the disguise of any be penetrated, all\r\nwould be obliged to pass a further 12 years in the forest. When the 12\r\nyears had expired, the brothers fixed on Viratnagar, the capital of\r\nVirata, King of the Malyas, in which to spend their year of concealment.\r\nYudhistira took the name of Kankbhat, a professional dicer, and Bhima\r\nthat of Ballava, a professional cook. Under their pseudonyms all five\r\nbrothers obtained posts in the King's service, while Draupadi, styling\r\nherself a _sairandhri_ or tirewoman, entered the service of the Queen\r\nSudeshna. Before the year of concealment ended Kichaka, the brother of\r\nQueen Sudeshna and commander-in-chief of the Malya forces, returned from\r\na visit to Duryodhan at Hastinapura. Duryodhan had given him as presents\r\nYudhistira's regalia and Draupadi's jewels, and Kichaka boasted that, as\r\nDuryodhan's friend, he would one after the other kill the five Pandavas\r\nin single combat and then wed their queen. While telling King Virata's\r\nCourt of his reception, his eye fell on Draupadi, and learning that she\r\nwas a _sairandhri_ and being struck with her beauty, he formally\r\nrequested the King Virata that she might be sent to his harem. The King\r\nconsenting, Yudhistira was faced with the dilemma of suffering his\r\nqueen's dishonour or of revealing his identity. Eventually his brother\r\nBhima solved the difficulty by secretly killing Kichaka.\r\n\r\nIt is out of this story that Mr. Khadilkar has sought for the materials\r\nof his play. It opens with the return of Kichaka to Viratnagar and his\r\npassion for the beautiful _sairandhri_. The latter seeks in turn the\r\nprotection of the King and his queen, and of Kichaka's wife Ratnaprabha;\r\nbut Kichaka, who as commander-in-chief and on account of the number of\r\nhis followers is all-powerful in Malya, becomes daily more insistent. He\r\nreminds the King of his past exploits, and threatens to leave his\r\nservice, taking his followers with him. Finally, Virata is driven to\r\nmake a feeble compromise. He will not himself hand over the _sairandhri_\r\nto Kichaka, but he will have her sent to a temple of Bairoba outside the\r\ntown, washing his hands of all responsibility as to subsequent events.\r\nAll this time the rescue of Draupadi has been repeatedly discussed\r\nbetween Yudhistira and his brother Bhima. The former is all for mild\r\nmethods, feeling sure that justice will ultimately prevail. The mighty\r\nBhima wishes to strangle Kichaka regardless of consequences. At last\r\nBhima and Draupadi together extract from him a most reluctant\r\npermission. Bhima goes secretly to the Bairoba temple, and removing from\r\nits stand the god's idol, he takes its place. So hidden, he is present\r\nwhen Draupadi, abandoned by the King's guards, is seized upon by\r\nKichaka. In vain Draupadi appeals to the latter for mercy. He laughs\r\nalike at tears and menaces, and is about to carry her off in triumph\r\nwhen the god Bairoba is seen to rise from his pedestal. It is Bhima. He\r\nseizes the terrified Kichaka, hurls him to the floor, and strangles him\r\nat Draupadi's feet.\r\n\r\nITS ALLEGORICAL MEANING.\r\n\r\nThese things are an allegory. Although his name is nowhere uttered on\r\nthe stage or mentioned in the printed play every one in the theatre\r\nknows that Kichaka is really intended to be Lord Curzon, that Draupadi\r\nis India, and that Yudhistira is the Moderate and Bhima the Extremist\r\nParty. Every now and again unmistakable clues are provided. The\r\nquestion, indeed, admits of no doubt, for since the play first appeared\r\nin 1907 the whole Deccan has been blazoning forth the identity of the\r\ncharacters. Once they have been recognized, the inner meaning of the\r\nplay becomes clear. A weak Government at home, represented by King\r\nVirata, has given the Viceroy a free hand. He has made use of it to\r\ninsult and humiliate India. Of her two champions, the Moderates advocate\r\ngentle--that is, constitutional--measures. The Extremists, out of\r\ndeference to the older party, agree, although satisfied of the\r\nineffectiveness of this course. Waiting until this has been\r\ndemonstrated, they adopt violent methods, and everything becomes easy.\r\nThe oppressor is disposed of without difficulty. His followers--namely,\r\nthe Anglo-Indians--are, as it is prophesied in the play and as narrated\r\nin the Mahabharata, massacred with equal ease. And the Extremists boast\r\nthat, having freed their country, they will be able to defend it against\r\nall invaders, thus averting the calamities which, according to Lord\r\nMorley, would overtake India on the disappearance of the British.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that all this is mere fooling. But no Englishman who has\r\nseen the play acted would agree. All his life he will remember the\r\ntense, scowling faces of the men as they watch Kichaka's outrageous\r\nacts, the glistening eyes of the Brahmin ladies as they listen to\r\nDraupadi's entreaties, their scorn of Yudhistira's tameness, their\r\nadmiration of Bhima's passionate protests, and the deep hum of\r\nsatisfaction which approves the slaughter of the tyrant.\r\n\r\nNOTE 4\r\n\r\nSHIVAJI'S EXHORTATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the _Kesari_ just a week before the Poona murders, the following\r\nverses were put into the mouth of Shivaji:\r\n\r\n   \"I delivered my country by establishing 'Swaraj' and saving religion.\r\n   I betook myself to the Paradise of Indra to shake off the great\r\n   exhaustion that came upon me from my labours. Why, O my beloved ones,\r\n   have you awakened me? I planted in the soil of Maharashtra virtues that\r\n   may be likened to the Kalpavriksha (one of the five trees of Indra's\r\n   Paradise that yields whatsoever may be desired); sublime policy based\r\n   on strong foundations, valour in the battlefield like that of Karma,\r\n   patriotism, genuine unselfishness, and unity, the best of all. ... Alas,\r\n   alas! all I see now is the ruin of my country. Those forts of mine to\r\n   build which I poured out money, to acquire which torrents of fiery blood\r\n   streamed forth, from which I sallied forth to victory roaring like a\r\n   lion--all those are crumbling away. What a desolation is this!\r\n   Foreigners are dragging out Lakshmi (the goddess of Good Fortune) by the\r\n   hand of persecution. Along with her Plenty has fled, and with Plenty,\r\n   Health. The wicked Akabaya (the goddess of Misfortune) stalks with\r\n   Famine at her side through the country, and relentless Death scatters\r\n   foul diseases.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Say, where are those splendid ones who promptly shed their blood\r\n   on the spot where my perspiration fell? They eat bread once in a day,\r\n   but not even enough of that. They toil through hard times by tightening\r\n   up their bellies. O People, how have you tolerated in the sacred places\r\n   the carrying off to prison of those holy preceptors, those religious\r\n   teachers of mine, those saintly Brahmans whom I protected--who, while\r\n   they devoted themselves to their religious practices in times of peace,\r\n   exchanged the Darbah (sacrificial grass) in their hands for weapons\r\n   which they used manfully when occasion required. The cow, the\r\n  foster-mother of babes when their mother leaves them, the mainstay of the\r\n  hard-worked peasant, the importer of strength to my people, whom I\r\n  worshipped as my mother and protected more than my life, is taken\r\n   daily to the slaughter-house and ruthlessly butchered by the\r\n   unbelievers.... How can I bear this heartrending spectacle? Have\r\n   all our leaders become like helpless figures on the chess-board? What\r\n   misfortune has overtaken the land!\"\r\n\r\nNOTE 5\r\n\r\nTILAK IN THE CIVIL COURTS.\r\n\r\nThe Tai Maharaj case came up once more in September on the Appellate\r\nside of the Bombay High Court on appeal against the decision of the\r\nLower Courts. It was contended on behalf of Tai Maharaj, the widow, that\r\nher adoption of one Jagganath was invalid owing to the undue influence\r\nbrought to bear upon her at the time by Tilak and one of his friends and\r\npolitical associates, Mr. G.S. Khaparde, who were executors under the\r\nwill of her husband, Shri Baba Maharajah. Mr. Justice Chandavarkar, in\r\nthe course of his judgment reversing the decisions of the Lower Courts,\r\nsaid that on the one hand they had a young inexperienced widow, with a\r\nright of ownership but ignorant of that right, and led to believe that\r\nshe was legally subject to the control of the executors of her husband's\r\nwill as regarded the management of the estate which she had by law\r\ninherited from her son, prevented from going to Kolhapur even to attend\r\na marriage in a family of relations, and anxious to adopt a boy from\r\nKolhapur as far as possible. On the other hand they had two men of\r\ninfluence learned in the law, taking her to an out-of-the-way place\r\nostensibly for the selection of a boy, and then, as it were, hustling\r\nher there by representing that everything was within, their discretion,\r\nand thereby forcing her to adopt their nominee. In these circumstances\r\nthey came to the conclusion that the adoption was not valid, because it\r\nwas brought about by means of undue influence exercised over Tai Maharaj\r\nby both Tilak and Khaparde.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Chandavarkar is a Hindu Judge of the highest reputation, and\r\nthe effect of this judgment is extremely damaging to Tilak's private\r\nreputation as a man of honour, or even of common honesty.\r\n\r\nNOTE 6\r\n\r\nKHUDIRAM BOSE'S CONFESSION.\r\n\r\nA similar confession was made by Khudiram Bose, the author of the fatal\r\nbomb outrage at Muzafferpur. When he was brought before the District\r\nMagistrate on May 1, 1908, within twenty-four hours of the crime, he\r\nstated: I came to Muzafferpur five or six days ago from Calcutta to kill\r\nMr. Kingsford. I came of my own initiative, having read in various\r\npapers things which incited me to come to this determination. These\r\npapers were the _Sandhya, Hitabadi, Jugantar_ and many others. They\r\nwrote of great _Zoolum_ done to India by the English Government. Mr.\r\nKingsford's name was not specially mentioned, but I determined to kill\r\nhim because he put several men in gaol. Besides reading the papers I\r\nheard the lectures of Bpin Pal, Surendranath Banerjee, Gisputty\r\nKabyatirtha, and others. There were lectures in Beadon-square and\r\nCollege-square [in the student quarter of Calcutta], and they inspired\r\nme to do this. There is also a Sanyasi who lectures in Beadon-square,\r\nwho is very strong.\r\n\r\nNOTE 7\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION AND POLITICS\r\n\r\nOn this point a very important piece of evidence has been recently\r\nproduced in Court in the course of the Dacca Conspiracy trial. It is a\r\nletter, of which the authenticity is beyond dispute, written by Mr.\r\nSurendranath Banerjee to one of the extremist leaders, in which he\r\nsuggests means for carrying out the proposed celebration of the\r\n\"boycott\" anniversary on August 7 in spite of the prohibition of public\r\nmeetings under the Seditious Meetings Act. \"My suggestion,\" writes this\r\ndistinguished politician, who is also the head of Ripon College, one of\r\nthe most popular colleges in Calcutta, \"is that you should organize a\r\nreligious ceremony on the 7th of August such as _Shakti-puja_ and\r\n_Kali-puja_, and have _Swadeshi kalka_ or _jatra_ and _Swadeshi_\r\nconversation by having a sort of conference. Give a religious turn to\r\nthe movement. As for the Muhammedans, if you can get them to your side,\r\nwhy not have a _wuz_ followed by _Swadeshi_ preaching? Kindly let me\r\nknow what you do. But something must be done.\" _Shakti_ rites and the\r\nworship of Kali are associated with some of the most libidinous and\r\ncruel of Hindu superstitions. The simultaneous attempt to attract\r\nMahomedans by grafting \"_Swadeshi_ preaching\" on to one of their\r\naccustomed religious services betrays Mr. Surendranath Banerjee's\r\ncynical indifference to any and every form of religious creed so long as\r\nit can be exploited in the interest of his political creed.\r\n\r\nNOTE 8\r\n\r\nTHE \"REMOVAL OF INFORMERS.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after the murder of Shams-ul-Alam, the following \"Appeal\" was\r\nprinted and issued in Calcutta with reference to the \"removal of\r\ninformers\":\r\n\r\n   HATYA NOY JAGNA.\r\n   (Not Murder but Sacrifice.)\r\n   Cash price: the head of a European or the heads of two Informers.\r\n   50th issue Calcutta, Sunday, 6th Chaitra, 1316.\r\n\r\nTempted by gold, some native devils in form of men, the disgrace of\r\nIndia--the police--arrested those great men Barendra Ghose and others\r\nwho worked for the freedom of their country by sacrificing their\r\ninterests and dedicating their lives in the performance of the sacred\r\nceremony of _Jagna_, preparing bombs. The greatest of these devils in\r\nhuman form, Ashitosh Biswas, began to pave for these heroes the way to\r\nthe gallows. Bravo, Charu! [the murderer of Biswas] all honour to your\r\nparents. To glorify them, to show the highest degree of courage,\r\ndisregarding the paltry short span of life, you removed the figure of\r\nthat monster from the world. Not long ago, the Whites by force and\r\ntrick, filched India from the Mahomedans. That mean wretch\r\nShams-ul-Alam, who espoused the cause of the enemies of Alamghir\r\nPadshah, who put a stain on the name of his forefathers for the sake of\r\ngold--to-day you have removed that fiend from the sacred soil of India.\r\nFrom Nuren Gossain to Talit Chakravarti, all turned approvers through\r\nthe machinations of that fiendish wizard Shams-ul-Alam and by his\r\ntorture. Had you not removed that ally of the monsters, could there be\r\nany hope for India?\r\n\r\nMany have raised the cry that to rebel is a great sin. But what is\r\nrebellion? Is there anything in India to rebel against? Can a Feringhee\r\nbe recognized as the King of India, whose very touch, whose mere shadow\r\ncompels Hindus to purify themselves?\r\n\r\nThese are merely Western Robbers looting India.... Extirpate them, ye\r\ngood sons of India, wherever you find them, without mercy, and with them\r\ntheir spies and secret agents. Last year 19 lakhs of men died of fever,\r\nsmallpox, cholera, plague, and other diseases in Bengal alone. Think\r\nyourselves fortunate that you were not counted amongst those, but\r\nremember that plague and cholera may attack you to-morrow, and is it not\r\nbetter for you to die like heroes?\r\n\r\nWhen God has so ordained, think ye not that at this auspicious moment it\r\nis the duty of every good son of India to slay these white enemies? Do\r\nnot allow yourselves to die of plague and cholera, thus polluting the\r\nsacred soil of Mother-India. Our _Shastras_ are our guide for\r\ndiscriminating between virtue and vice. Our _Shastras_ repeatedly tell\r\nus that the killing of these white fiends and of their aiders and\r\nabettors is equal to a great ceremonial sacrifice _(Asyamedh Jagna_.)\r\nCome, one and all. Let us offer our sacrifice before the altar in\r\nchorus, and pray that in this ceremony all white serpents may perish in\r\nits flames as the vipers perished in the serpent slaying ceremony of\r\n_Janmajob_. Keep in mind that it is not murder but _Jagna_--a\r\nsacrificial rite.\r\n\r\nNOTE 9\r\n\r\nBENGALEE LAWLESSNESS.\r\n\r\nA very striking, and at the same time sober, picture of the conditions\r\nproduced by Bengalee methods of agitation is to be found in the speech\r\ndelivered at the opening of the Provincial Legislature of Eastern Bengal\r\nat Dacca on April 6, 1910, by Sir Lancelot Hare, the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nappointed in succession to Sir Bampfylde Fuller. \"We have had abundant\r\nexperience,\" he said, \"in the last three years that the advocacy of the\r\nboycott at public meetings is invariably followed by acts of tyranny and\r\nbrutality and illegal interference with the rights of a free people to\r\nbuy and sell as they, and not as a particular set of agitators, prefer.\r\nNo district officer anxious to maintain the peace of his district can\r\nallow a recrudescence of these disturbances. I have seen it denied that\r\nthere have been such cases, but the state calendar of crime is there to\r\nrefute such an assertion; and you and I well know that the cases which\r\nhave been brought to trial bear a very small proportion to the cases\r\nwhich have arisen but which the raiyats have been afraid to press home.\r\nWhen we remember the enormous power of the zemindar following from the\r\nunfortunate absence of any record of right upon which the tenant can\r\nlean, and rely, we can well understand how a raiyat hesitates to oppose\r\nhis landlord's will. I have seen, it claimed that such advocacy of the\r\nboycott is a constitutional right. The extraordinary fallacy of this\r\nassertion hardly needs refuting. With a democratic Government an appeal\r\nto the public is an appeal to the Government, as it is an appeal to the\r\nvoter who appoints the member of Parliament who appoints the Government.\r\nSuch a condition does not exist in this country, and when an agitator\r\nwho wishes to press his views on Government says that the boycott will\r\nbe preached until Government takes a particular course which Government\r\nhas decided is not for the good of the people, and has announced that it\r\nwill not adopt, such an appeal is not a constitutional act nor an appeal\r\nto Government but an act of defence and open resistance to Government.\r\nThis Government now as always will do what it believes to be in the best\r\ninterests of the people. It will always give such regard as it can to\r\nrespectful representations, even when they come from a small minority\r\nonly of the population; but appeals to force and violence, appeals to\r\nthe mob for race hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness, do not\r\nconstitute constitutional agitation. I would say a few words on the\r\nmischief of the boycott agitation. The boycott agitation has been the\r\ncurse of this province for the past five years, causing endless\r\nsuffering and unrest, obstructing the path of progress, exciting\r\nill-feeling between Government and the people, and hindering their\r\nco-operation in the work of reconstitution and reform. The agitation has\r\ndisplayed itself in many evil forms, all tending to oppression, and\r\nlawlessness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MANY-HEADED MISCHIEF.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to review this many-headed mischief in a few words, but\r\nits main features may readily be brought to mind. First there is the\r\neconomic disturbance which resulted from the enforcement of the boycott\r\nwhether by persuasion, or by intimidation or by force. This has been a\r\nvery real mischief and a very real suffering in many parts of the\r\ncountry where the cultivators found themselves unable to obtain the\r\nproducts to which they were accustomed at prices which they could afford\r\nto pay. Next is to be noted the violent scenes in the bazaars, where the\r\nsale of British goods was sought to be obstructed by organized force.\r\nThe deplorable riot at Jamalpore, with its terrible sequel, is only one\r\namong many such scenes. A closely allied evil was the picketing of the\r\nbazaars by students and other young men, which became an intolerable\r\nnuisance until it was put down with a strong hand. The case at\r\nJhalakati, where the young boycotters practically took possession of the\r\nbazaar, is a prominent typical instance. Then followed the numerous\r\ncases of interference with individuals with the accompaniment of assault\r\nand mischief and criminal restraint. The long list of crimes of this\r\nnature that have been punished in due course would be wearisome to\r\nrepeat. No less mischievous and perhaps even more widespread and more\r\ncommon have been the cases of criminal intimidation, in which notices\r\nhave been posted, or letters have been sent, threatening vendors or\r\npurchasers individually or collectively with arson or murder or other\r\noutrage. Wealthy zemindars and bankers, shopkeepers of all grades, and\r\nvillagers and townsfolk have alike prayed to be protected from such\r\ninterference in the lawful pursuit of their ordinary avocations; and too\r\noften it has been impossible to afford this protection. That these\r\nthreats were not mere idle extravagance has been proved to the hilt by\r\nthe grave incidents that have actually taken place. More widespread,\r\nmore difficult to deal with, and causing even greater suffering than\r\nthese violent methods has been the social persecution which has been\r\nexercised upon those who have failed to bow down to the orders of the\r\nboycotters. This is one of the most serious chapters in the whole\r\nhistory of the agitation, and Government has again had to deplore the\r\nsufferings to which quiet and law-abiding persons have been subjected.\r\nThe constitution of Hindu society lends itself with great readiness to\r\nthis form of compulsion, and no weapon is more feared than social\r\nostracism when ruthlessly used in pursuance of a political object.\r\nAnother most grave aspect of the boycott agitation has been the constant\r\nattempt to excite disaffection against Government by public meetings,\r\nspeeches, propagandist tours, newspapers, pamphlets, songs, flaunting\r\nand noisy processions, and dramatic performances. Every effort has been\r\nmade to try and persuade the people that the Government is hostile,\r\ncallous, and neglectful and that boycott, and its kindred measures, are\r\nthe means by which to bring it to a better course. Some of the worst\r\noffenders have been prosecuted under the law and have paid the penalty\r\nof their crimes, but it is impossible by such means to counteract or\r\nnullify the mischief that they and others have caused.\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUTHS AND POLITICS.\r\n\r\nThere remains another point which is at the present time of the most\r\nsinister significance. The promoters of the agitation conceived the\r\ndeplorable idea that their propaganda might best be spread, and that\r\ntheir designs might best be carried out by the youths of the country.\r\nFrom this selection has arisen what is now the worst feature of the\r\nsituation. It is impossible to condemn too strongly the use of the\r\nstudents and other youths to foster political aims. It has resulted in a\r\nwave of excitement amongst immature and impressionable minds throughout\r\nthe affected districts. In this province in the first instance this evil\r\nexhibited itself in the constant appearance of youths in the forefront\r\nof political demonstration, however hostile and objectionable in\r\ncharacter. This phenomenon was naturally accompanied by numerous\r\ninstances of indiscipline among students which Government has repeatedly\r\nbeen obliged to denounce. The effect on the minds of the most\r\nimpressionable youths, and especially among those who had a ready means\r\nof livelihood and an available occupation, has reached a pitch which was\r\ndoubtless never contemplated by the more sober among those who initiated\r\nthis regrettable movement. Nevertheless a series of crimes in which\r\nyouths belonging to the respectable classes have been known to\r\nparticipate must be regarded as directly attributable to the excitement\r\nof political agitation. It is impossible to avoid mentioning in this\r\nconnexion the system of national schools which was to be lauded in all\r\nthree of the prohibited Conferences, and which has been encouraged in\r\nother similar meetings that are taking place.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years in this Province the record of these schools\r\nis an evil one. They were established in open hostility to the State\r\nsystem of education, which is the true national system, and several of\r\nthe most important were opened for the purpose of receiving boys\r\nexpelled from or punished in other schools for taking part in political\r\ndemonstrations of a most reprehensible character. Their subsequent\r\nhistory has accorded with the spirit in which they were founded and\r\ntheir close connexion with forms of political agitation most unhealthy\r\nfor young minds has been evinced in many a regrettable incident.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLOOK.\r\n\r\nIf we review the present position we find that during the past year\r\nthere has been some subsidence of the acute stage of the malady, or\r\nrather it has taken a different turn. The bulk of the reasonable\r\ninhabitants have become wearied of the senseless agitation which brings\r\nannoyance and suffering without doing them good. There is less active\r\nboycott and the ordinary citizen has become less amenable to the leaders\r\nof the agitation. But in spite of this, two circumstances stand\r\nout--first, the local leaders have not in general abated one tittle of\r\ntheir efforts to enforce the boycott, and where in any locality they\r\nshowed signs of resting, their chiefs are ready to urge them forward;\r\nsecondly, the perversion of our young men has reached a most alarming\r\nstage, not merely from the point of view of the crime and the sense of\r\ninsecurity that it engenders, but also from the more general aspect of\r\nthe character and prospects of the rising generation. Many parents have\r\nmost bitter reason to lament their failure to guide, control, and\r\nrestrain their children. On the 7th August boycott celebrations occurred\r\nat the headquarters of each district of the Dacca division, and at a\r\nnumber of places in the interior. The boycott vow was everywhere renewed\r\nand at several meetings speeches were delivered, the tendency and object\r\nof which was to excite renewed disaffection and to stir up zeal for the\r\ncause. The observances for the 16th October were prescribed in an order\r\nof the chiefs published in the Calcutta papers, and the local leaders\r\ndid their best to carry out these instructions. Rakhibandan bathing,\r\nabstinence from cooked food, and the solemn renewal of the boycott vow\r\nwere the principal features. In some places public meetings were held\r\nand again the tone of several speakers was most reprehensible. District\r\nconferences and other similar meetings played their usual important part\r\nin the year's programme. In the Dacca division, Jhalakati, Faridpur, and\r\nPangsa were selected as the theatres of those performances. The\r\nresolutions were varied in character, but however guarded and mild their\r\nphraseology, the speeches advocated boycott in its most blatant form,\r\nand sentiments were expressed tending to keep alive the most pernicious\r\nand dangerous characteristics of the political and social situation.\r\nSimilar conferences, in which the boycott played a prominent part, and\r\nin which ill-feeling against the Government was excited, were held in\r\nAugust and September at Pabna and Dinajpur, and in the Sylhet district\r\nin October a series of meetings took place. In a portion of the Faridpur\r\ndistrict, the unsettled condition of which has for some time been a\r\ncause of anxiety, the inhabitants are mostly Namasudras. The ostensible\r\nobject of these meetings was to raise the social condition of the\r\npeople, but it appears from the accounts published in the Press that the\r\nAnti-Partition agitation and the boycott of foreign goods were urged and\r\nthe promise of social privilege was only made as a reward or return for\r\npromising to take the boycott vow. This condition of affairs could not\r\nbe permitted to continue indefinitely, and it became evident that sooner\r\nor later--and the sooner the better--the mischief must be stopped and\r\nthe people of the province given the opportunity which they need and\r\ndesire to settle down to their normal life and to co-operation with the\r\nGovernment for their material and moral progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 10\r\n\r\nSACRIFICING \"WHITE GOATS\"\r\n\r\nThe term occurs, for instance, in one of the most violent fly-sheets\r\nissued only a few months ago from a clandestine press in India, under\r\nthe heading _Yagantar_, killing no murder:--\r\n\r\nRise up, rise up, O sons of India, arm yourselves with bombs, despatch\r\nthe white _Asuras_ to Yana's abode. Invoke the mother Kali; nerve your\r\narm with valour. The Mother asks for sacrificial offerings. What does\r\nthe Mother want? The cocoanut? No. A fowl or a sheep or a buffalo? No,\r\nShe wants many white _Asuras_. The Mother is thirsting after the blood\r\nof the Feringhees who have bled her profusely. Satisfy her thirst.\r\nKilling the Feringhee, we say, is no murder. Brother, chant this verse\r\nwhile slaying the Feringhee white goat, for killing him is no murder:\r\nWith the close of a long era, the Feringhee Empire draws to an end for\r\nbehold!

For instance, in a\r\nLondon newspaper which calls itself \"the Organ of Social Democracy,\"\r\n_Justice_ there appeared on August 27 a \"Manifesto\" headed \"The Infamies\r\nof Liberal Rule in India,\" which contained, along with much\r\nindiscriminate denunciation of British tyranny, the outrageous statement\r\nthat Savarkar, who is now undergoing trial in Bombay on grave charges,\r\nincluding the abetment of murder, had been arrested in England \"for an\r\nalleged political offence, and in order that he might not have a fair\r\ntrial defended by Council, and safeguarded by public opinion in this\r\ncountry, he was sent back to India, where, innocent or guilty, his\r\ncondemnation could be officially ensured.\" In conclusion, it was\r\nstated:--\"We, at any rate, shall take care that this little manifesto of\r\nours shall be distributed in the native languages throughout Hindustan,\r\nin order that the population of that great Empire may know that there is\r\nan active and growing party in this island which has neither part nor\r\nlot in the outrages and crimes committed by our rulers, and that its\r\nmembers heartily sympathize with the legitimate efforts of Indians of\r\nall races, castes, and creeds to emancipate themselves finally from the\r\nmonstrous domination under which they suffer to-day.\"\r\n\r\nMany loyal Indians, and indeed the disloyal ones too, may very\r\nreasonably ask whether it is right and just to allow language of this\r\nkind to be used and circulated with impunity in this country when, if it\r\nwere used and circulated in India, it would at once give rise to a\r\ncriminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nNOTE 14\r\n\r\nINDIAN STUDENTS IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nAn Indian Correspondent of _The Times_ who has made a special study of\r\nthe condition of his fellow-countrymen studying in England writes that\r\nit would be almost impossible for an Englishman who has never been in\r\nthe East to realize the enormous difference between the life to which\r\nthe student has been used and the life to which he has come. In many\r\ninstances his home is in some far off lonely village. He may have been\r\nto some town to study in a Government or missionary school or college.\r\nBut that has not given him an insight into English life. In the\r\nGovernment institution he sees little of his English teacher or\r\nprofessor outside lessons or lecture hours. He never has the chance of\r\nknowing an English lady. The student has little time for more than his\r\nstudies, so numerous are the subjects and the prescribed text-books for\r\nIndian examinations. In the vacations the Professors go to the hills, or\r\nsail for England, and the student goes back to his village. He has\r\nacquired little or no knowledge of the English. He comes to England\r\nfeeling there is a gulf between the East and the West, save in the case\r\nof a missionary interest in his soul. He is by nature extremely\r\nsensitive. On board ship he and his brother Indians keep together. The\r\nEnglish passengers, fatigued after a period of hard work in a hot\r\nclimate, have no energy left for the effort of trying to draw out and\r\nknow this batch of silent Orientals. So the gulf gapes wide. If they\r\ntarry in Marseilles or Paris there are those who are anxious and ready\r\nto widen this gulf between the Indians and English. Then the student\r\narrives in London, where a man can be more lonely than anywhere in the\r\nworld. Here he has to find a dwelling. The man from a dreamy, lonely,\r\nEastern village, from the land of the sun has to select an abode in\r\nLondon. Hotels and boarding houses and lodgings there are in abundance;\r\nbut the hotel or boarding house or lodging suitable to this man's\r\nneed--fitted to introduce him to English life, may exist, but how is he\r\nto find it? He is not only bewildered, he is terribly home-sick. His\r\nwish to come to England has been, gratified, but oh! for a sight of his\r\nown people and, his simple home. He must drown this longing as best he\r\nmay. There are many ways of drowning it in London. There are many who\r\nwill assist him to forget what he had better never forget--his village\r\nhome. But after all there are some English people who will know him. He\r\nhas found lodgings, and the landlady and her family make themselves most\r\nagreeable. He knows no other English people. He wants friendliness so\r\nfar away from home, so these and theirs become his friends.\r\n\r\nIn London the majority of Indian students gain admission to the Inns of\r\nCourt. The new regulations, which come into force in January next, were\r\nintended to render admission more difficult to attain; but they will\r\nfail of their purpose, for success in the Oxford and Cambridge senior\r\nlocal examinations is a qualification for admission, and these\r\nexaminations are held in various parts of India. Students will in future\r\navoid entering the Indian Universities, but will get private coaching,\r\nand sit for these examinations in India, with a view to gaining\r\nadmission to one or other of the Inns. It never seems to have occurred\r\nto the Honourable Societies of the Inns to take any steps to look after\r\nthe well-being of these numberless students, who bring hundreds of\r\npounds to their coffers every year. So different is their position from\r\nthat of the English student that their case merits special attention. To\r\nlook after them might be unusual, it would certainly be expedient. The\r\neating of a few dinners and attendance at certain lectures are no tax on\r\nthe student's time. He puts off real study to the last moment. It is so\r\neasy to learn all the subjects just before each examination. With a few\r\nexceptions the English and Indian students do not speak to each other.\r\nSo the Inns do not provide the Indian with society. A youth from the\r\nEast, dwelling in a London lodging, finding himself for the first time\r\nin command of a banking account, with abundance of leisure, and no\r\nEnglish friends of his own standing--can he become a loyal, useful\r\ncitizen of our Empire?\r\n\r\nSome of them go to Oxford and Cambridge. They have heard in India, from\r\nsome Indians who were up at these Universities from ten to fifteen years\r\nago, how delightful the life is--how sociable the undergraduates, how\r\nhospitable the dons. Surely then at these ancient seats of learning they\r\nwill find friendliness, and will come to know the English. They go up\r\nonly to find disappointment. The numbers have largely increased and all\r\nsorts and conditions of men come. Colleges are reluctant to admit them.\r\nThe English undergraduate accepts any man who is good at games and ready\r\nto enter into the University life, but leaves severely alone the man of\r\nany nationality who has had no opportunity of learning English games,\r\nand who is too shy and sensitive to show what he is worth. Those who are\r\ngood at games get on, the others are far from being happy. A few gain\r\nadmission to colleges, the rest are \"unattached.\" Lodging-house\r\nexistence at Oxford or Cambridge is preferable to that in London; but it\r\ndoes not assist to a knowledge of the English. Foreigners at the\r\nUniversities take the trouble to try and know the Indian, and extend to\r\nhim that friendship which the English undergraduate, through youthful\r\nlack of thought, withholds. The Imperial instinct is lacking in the\r\nyouth of to-day; else would they realize that it is an important duty to\r\ntry and know fellow-subjects from a distant part of the Empire. There is\r\nnothing that Orientals will not do to make the stranger to their country\r\nfeel at home. They cannot understand the reserved Occidental who leaves\r\nthe stranger to his Western country all alone. Some of the Indian\r\nstudents think that the only way to bid for the English undergraduate's\r\nacquaintance is by a lavish expenditure on wine parties; and so he\r\nspends largely, and acquires an acquaintance, but not with the typical\r\nEnglishman. If Indian students at the old Universities are only to know\r\neach other or foreigners, how are they to be bound by a loyal attachment\r\nto England? At Edinburgh the gulf is wide indeed. A number of Colonial\r\nstudents help to make it wider. The two sides seldom or never meet.\r\nThey just tolerate each other's presence. So the Indian student is\r\ntempted to seek for company in circles which do not help his education\r\nor tend to elevate him. Should such a state of things continue?\r\n\r\nEngineering and medical students are in better case than others. Their\r\nwork is so hard and exacting, if they do it aright, they have no time to\r\nfeel solitude. The one complaint of engineering students is that they\r\nfind it enormously difficult to gain opportunities for learning the\r\npractical side of their work. Firms are most reluctant to admit them as\r\napprentices. France and Germany welcome them, and Continental firms\r\nextend to them the aid the English firms deny. Is it always to be so?\r\nOther nations gaining that esteem and gratitude which England should so\r\njealously acquire and guard. Americans, too, are winning the good will\r\nof the Indian student both in India and abroad. They have well-equipped\r\nschools and colleges all over India. They spare no efforts to make the\r\nIndian student feel they are there solely for him. They are with him in\r\nand out of school and college hours. They inspire him with their\r\nenthusiasm. Wherever they meet him they give him a grip of the hand\r\nwhich leaves him in no doubt as to their frank friendliness. Yet it is\r\nnot to America nor to any other nation that India belongs, but to\r\nEngland. But there is no security in mere possession. The only safety\r\nlies in the constant effort to hold--to hold pleasantly, gaining the\r\nheart and head.\r\n\r\nSurely the fact that many influences are at work systematically striving\r\nto estrange these students from England should rouse the English to\r\neffort. It may not be an easy task to gain these men. It will need\r\npatience and zeal. There must be no touch of patronage in the attempt.\r\nTheir deep-rooted belief that no real friendship can exist between the\r\nEnglish and the Indian has to be overcome; the much misrepresentation\r\nwhich has made the Indian student misjudge the English character has to\r\nbe counteracted and set right. It must be remembered that he is a being\r\nfar away from home, excessively sensitive, situated in extremely unusual\r\nsurroundings and in most cases having lost that religious belief without\r\nwhich no Oriental is really happy or able to live and be his best. He\r\nis, in truth, not himself. Such is the student who is to be won to\r\nattachment. The difficulty of the task should appeal to the English\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWhat is required is not a sudden and indiscriminate rush to seek out and\r\nknow the Indian student. That would not last and would lead to much\r\ndisappointment on both sides. The great need of the present is workers\r\nwho know both sides and who will judiciously draw them together.\r\nConnecting links to bring the right Indians into touch with the right\r\nEnglish. They will need very special qualifications, these workers, if\r\nthey are to succeed. There is enough to be done to employ the full time\r\nof exceptionally energetic men. Wonders could be worked if England only\r\nrealized her duty to these men. The Indian student would return to his\r\nhome at any rate with no feeling of bitterness. He would have his chance\r\nof seeing the real English, and of being influenced aright.\r\nMisconceptions would be banished. He would live in an atmosphere better\r\nadapted to hard work. He would attain a higher standard in his studies\r\nand examinations. He would be better fitted to be a useful citizen.\r\nFriendliness would, at any rate, have blunted antagonistic tendencies.\r\nAnd what a difference it would make to his people! The father who has\r\nspent so much on him would no longer feel that his son has lost and not\r\ngained by crossing the seas. The mother who, though behind the purdah,\r\nhas eagerly been watching his career, dwelling lovingly on the weekly\r\nnews, counting the days to his return, would no longer need to weep that\r\nit is not well with her son, who has come back so different from all she\r\nhad hoped. Whole families would bless the England which had made their\r\nmember manly, upright, better for his sojourn there, fitted to earn a\r\nliving honourably, and possessed of grit to strive to do his best. And\r\nhe, the student, stirred, by memories of kindness in the West, would win\r\nthose with whom he comes in contact to a friendlier feeling for the\r\nBritish race. The seditionist would find no soil here ready for his\r\nseed. Could anything be better worth accomplishing?\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 15\r\n\r\nTHE VICEROY'S EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Mahomedan gentleman, Mr. Ali Imam, has been appointed to succeed Mr.\r\nSinha as Indian member of the Viceroy's Executive Council. He too is a\r\nleading member of the Bengal Bar, and, like Mr. Sinha, will take charge\r\nof the Legal Department. Though the selection of a Mahomedan in\r\nsuccession to a Hindu cannot fail to gratify Indian Moslems, Mr. Ali\r\nImam's appointment should not be altogether unacceptable to the Hindus.\r\nFor when the details of the reforms' scheme were being worked out in\r\nIndia, he adopted, on the subject of separate electorates for the\r\nMahomedan community, a line of his own which was applauded by the\r\nHindus, but was very much resented by the vast majority of his\r\nco-religionists. The Government of India seemed inclined to favour his\r\nproposals, and he proceeded to England to press them upon Lord Morley.\r\nBut the Secretary of State wisely decided that the pledges originally\r\ngiven by Lord Minto to the Indian Mahomedans must be scrupulously and\r\nfully redeemed, so as to secure to them substantial representation in\r\nthe new Councils.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 16\r\n\r\nThe first Indian Member of the Bengal Executive Council is expected to\r\nbe Mr. R.N. Mookerjee, a partner in the well-known Calcutta firm of\r\nMessrs. Martin and Co., to whom I have referred (page 258) as \"the one\r\nbrilliant exception\" amongst Western-educated Bengalees, who has\r\nachieved signal success in commerce and industry and has shown the\r\npossibility and the advantages of intelligent and business-like\r\nco-operation in those fields between Englishmen and Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 17\r\n\r\nTHE WASTAGE IN INDIAN UNIVERSITIES.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature about the number of graduates at the Indian\r\nUniversities is not the magnitude of their total or any increase in it,\r\nbut the very high proportion of wastage. It takes 24,000 candidates at\r\nMatriculation to secure 11,000 passes, it takes 7,000 candidates at the\r\nIntermediate examination to secure 2,800 passes, and it takes 4,750\r\ncandidates for the B.A. degree to secure 1,900 passes.\r\n\r\nThere are 18,000 students at college in order to supply an annual output\r\nof 1,935 graduates. This means that a very large number fall out by the\r\nway without completing successfully their University career. The\r\nphenomenon, peculiar to India, of candidates for employment urging as a\r\nqualification that they have failed at a University examination (meaning\r\nthat they have passed the preceding examination and added thereto some\r\nyears of study for the next) is due to two causes, the large number of\r\nstudents whom the University rejects at its examinations before it\r\ngrants the B.A. degree to the remainder, and the dearth of graduates.\r\n_(Quinquennial Report on the Progress of Education in India for_\r\n1902-1907, by Mr. H.W. Orange, Director-General of Education.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 18\r\n\r\nENGLISH HISTORY IN INDIAN SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the opening of an Educational Conference held last April in Bombay\r\nunder the joint auspices of the Director of Public Instruction and of\r\nthe Teachers' Association, the Governor, Sir George Clarke, alluded to\r\nsome of the effects of Western education on the younger generation of\r\nIndians:--\"It is widely admitted by the thoughtful Indians that there\r\nare signs of the weakening of parental influence, of the loss of\r\nreverence for authority, of a decadence of manners and of growing moral\r\nlaxity. The restraining forces of ancient India have lost some of their\r\npower; the restraining forces of the West are inoperative in India.\r\nThere has thus been a certain moral loss without any corresponding gain.\r\nThe educated European may throw off the sanctions of religion; but he\r\nhas to live in a social environment which has been built up on the basis\r\nof Christian morality, and he cannot divest himself of the influences\r\nwhich have formed his conscience. The educated or partially educated\r\nIndian who has learned to look on life and the affairs of men from a\r\nWestern standpoint has no such environment and may find himself morally\r\nrudderless on an ocean of doubt. The restraints of ancient philosophies,\r\nwhich have unconsciously helped to shape the lives of millions in India\r\nwho had only the dimmest knowledge of them, have disappeared from his\r\nmental horizon. There is nothing to take their place. Ancient customs,\r\nsome of them salutary and ennobling, have come to be regarded as\r\nobsolete. No other customs of the better sort have come to take their\r\nplace, and blindly to copy the superficial customs of the West is to\r\nignore all that is best in western civilization.\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on his Excellency's speech, the Bombay _Examiner_, a weekly\r\npaper very ably conducted in the interests of the Roman Catholic\r\nmissions, drew attention, in the following terms to some of the causes\r\nof the mischief.\r\n\r\n(1) The study of English history in schools reveals a gradual transition\r\nfrom an unlimited monarchy to a limited monarchy differing barely from a\r\nrepublic, the gradual transfer of political power from kings and\r\naristocracy through the barons and then through the burghers and finally\r\nto the whole people. In reality this process took almost a thousand\r\nyears, but in the schoolroom it is compressed into a term. The\r\ngradualness of the process, the long preparation of each class of\r\ncitizens, the slow political education of the masses, all of which forms\r\na long historical perspective, is through the medium of the text-book\r\nthrown upon, the screen at once as a flat picture. It may not occur\r\nperhaps to the young mind to apply the precedent to his own country; but\r\nas soon as he falls under the influence of the political agitator the\r\nquestion, suggests itself: If the English people thus fought their way\r\nto supremacy, why should not the Indian people do the same? Losing\r\nsight of the perspective of history, it seems to him feasible that India\r\nshould achieve in one bound what it took nearly a thousand years for the\r\nEnglish people to bring about.\r\n\r\n(2) In studying political economy and social science he meets with such\r\nprinciples as these--that the ruler is merely the delegate and\r\nrepresentative of the people, from whose will he derives all his power.\r\nThis power is to be exercised for the well-being of the people who have\r\nconferred it, and according to their will in conferring it. The old idea\r\nthat all power, even that conferred through the people, is ultimately\r\nderived from God and exercised in His Name, is of course never heard of.\r\nThe ruler is a public servant of the collective nation, and that is all.\r\nTo introduce this notion among a people whose idea of government has run\r\nfor thousands of years on the lines of absolute monarchy and hereditary\r\nif not divine right is nothing short of revolutionary. All idea of the\r\nsacredness of authority is at once gone. The Government is a thing to be\r\ndictated to by the people, to be threatened and bullied and even\r\nexterminated if it does not comply with the nation's wishes. Hence as\r\nsoon as the political agitator appears on the scene nothing seems more\r\nplausible to the raw mind of the student than an endeavour to upset the\r\nexisting order of things. This cannot, of course, all be done at once;\r\nbut at least a beginning can be made. Let us agitate for the redress of\r\nthis or that grievance, for the increase of native appointments, and the\r\nlike; and if we do not at once get what we ask for, let us try what\r\nbullying and intimidation can do--aspiring ultimately to substitute a\r\nrepresentative for a monarchical form of government, and having secured\r\nthis, wait the opportune moment for driving the foreigner into the sea.\r\nThus a change which, to be successful, would require the gradual\r\neducation of the people for generations, is to be forced on at once; and\r\n\"if constitutional means are not sufficient to achieve our ambition, why\r\nnot try what unconstitutional means will do?\"\r\n\r\nNOTE 19\r\n\r\nA SHAMELESS APPEAL.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most audacious defence of the enlistment by Hindu\r\npoliticians of schoolboys and students in the service of a lawless\r\npropaganda occurs in an article in the _Bengalee_ of August 2, 1906,\r\nshamelessly appealing to the language of Christ. The _Bengalee_, which\r\nis published in English, is Mr. Surendranath Banerjee's organ:--\r\n\r\n\"In all great movements boys and young men play a prominent part, the\r\ndivine message comes first to them; and they are persecuted and they\r\nsuffer for their faith. 'Suffer the little children to come unto Me,'\r\nare the words of the divinely-inspired Founder of Christianity; and the\r\nfaith that is inseparable from childhood and youth is the faith which\r\nhas built up great creeds and has diffused them through the world. Our\r\nboys and young men have been persecuted for their _Swadeshism_; and\r\ntheir sufferings have made _Swadeshism_ strong and vigorous.\"\r\n\r\n_NOTE 20 (page_ 241).\r\n\r\nTHE BRAHMANS AND WESTERN EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nThe special caste grievances of Brahmans against Western education are\r\nvery frankly set forth in a speech on \"The Duties of Brahmans,\"\r\ndelivered in Bombay at the beginning of this year to his fellow\r\ncaste-men by Rao Sahib Joshi, a distinguished and very enlightened,\r\nmember of the Yajurvidi Palshikar sept of Brahmans. Mr. Joshi, who laid\r\ngreat stress upon the duty of loyalty to the British _Raj_, began by\r\nrecalling the patent conferred upon them by a British Governor of Bombay\r\nat the beginning of the eighteenth century for the protection of their\r\nprivileges, especially in connexion with the teaching of medicine. But\r\ntheir community had gradually lost ground from various causes, and\r\namongst those which he enumerated, he laid the chief stress upon the\r\ndiffusion of secular education. He fully recognized the benefits of\r\nEnglish education, but \"all education being of a secular character, it\r\nmade the new generation a class of sceptics. People brought up with\r\nEnglish ideas, and in the atmosphere of secular education, now began to\r\npay less respect to their Gurus and hereditary priests. In former days\r\nwhen the Guru or head priest came to one's house people used to say:--'I\r\nbow down to the Guru; the Guru is Brahma, the Guru is Vishnu, the Guru\r\nis Shiwa; verily the Guru is the Sublime Brahma!' This idea, this\r\nrespect the secular English education shattered to pieces, and so the\r\nincome and importance of the hereditary priests dwindled down.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 21\r\n\r\nFEMALE EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nIn his quinquennial review of the progress of education in India, Mr.\r\nH.W. Orange quotes the following remarks by Mr. Sharp, Director of\r\nPublic Instruction in Eastern Bengal, on the position of female\r\neducation, adding that they describe the prevailing, if not quite\r\nuniversal, state of affairs:--\r\n\r\n\"All efforts to promote female education have hitherto encountered\r\npeculiar difficulties. These difficulties arise chiefly from the customs\r\nof the people themselves. The material considerations, which have formed\r\na contributing factor in the spread of boys' schools, are inoperative in\r\nthe case of girls. The natural and laudable desire for education as an\r\nend in itself, which is evinced by the upper and middle classes as\r\nregards their sons, is no match for the conservative instincts of the\r\nMahomedans, the system of early marriage among the Hindus, and the rigid\r\nseclusion of women which is a characteristic of both. These causes\r\nprevent any but the most elementary education from being given to girls.\r\nThe lack of female teachers and the alleged unsuitability of the\r\ncurriculum, which is asserted to have been framed more with a view to\r\nthe requirements of boys than those of girls, form subsidiary reasons or\r\nexcuses against more rapid progress. To these difficulties may be added\r\nthe belief, perhaps more widely felt than expressed, that the general\r\neducation of women means a social revolution, the extent of which cannot\r\nbe foreseen. 'Indian gentlemen,' it has been well said, 'may thoroughly\r\nallow that when the process has been completed, the nation will rise in\r\nintelligence, in character and in all the graces of life. But they are\r\nnone the less apprehensive that while the process of education is going\r\non, while the lessons of emancipation are being learnt and stability has\r\nnot yet been reached, while, in short, society is slowly struggling to\r\nadjust itself to the new conditions, the period of transition will be\r\nmarked by the loosening of social ties, the upheaval of customary ways,\r\nand by prolonged and severe domestic embarrassment.' There is, it is\r\ntrue, an advanced section of the community that is entirely out of\r\nsympathy with this view. In abandoning child-marriage they have got rid\r\nof the chief obstacle to female education; and it is among them,\r\nconsequently, that female education has made proportionately the\r\ngreatest progress in quantity and still more in quality. But outside\r\nthis small and well-marked class, the demand for female education is\r\nmuch less active and spontaneous.... In fact the people at large\r\nencourage or tolerate the education of their girls only up to an age and\r\nup to a standard at which it can do little good, or, according to their\r\npoint of view, little harm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 22\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF THE \"DRAIN.\"\r\n\r\nThe Master of Elibank, then Under-Secretary of State, included in his\r\nIndian Budget speech on Aug. 5, 1909, a brief but effective refutation\r\nof the \"drain\" theory:--\r\n\r\n\"If the House will allow me, I wish to digress for a moment to deal with\r\na charge that is constantly made, and has recently been repeated, to the\r\neffect that there is poverty in India which is largely due to the\r\npolitical and commercial drain on the country year by year, the\r\npolitical, it is asserted, amounting to £30,000,000 and the commercial\r\nto £40,000,000. These figures have been placed even higher by those who\r\nwish to blacken the Indian Administration in order to bolster up a\r\nmalicious agitation against this country. I think it is incumbent upon\r\nthe representative of the Indian Government in this House to deal with\r\nthe statement. I may at once say that it has no foundation in fact.\r\n(Hear, hear.) Its origin is to be found, no doubt, in the fact that\r\nIndia makes annually considerable payments in England in return for\r\nservices rendered, such as the loan of British capital; but there is no\r\njustification for describing these payments as a drain, and their amount\r\nis only a fraction of the figures which I have just quoted. Let me deal\r\nfirst with the question of amount. As the method by which India makes\r\nher payments in England is that she exports more than she imports, all\r\ncalculations as to the amount of payments must necessarily be based on\r\nthe returns of Indian trade, which show by how much the Indian exports\r\nexceed her imports. If the trade returns are examined for 1904, 1906,\r\nand 1906, after making due allowance for the capital sent to India in\r\nconnexion with Government transactions, the average excess of exports\r\nover imports, or in other words payments by India to England for\r\nservices rendered, is £23,900,000 per year during the three years that\r\nhave been mentioned. This payment is made up of, first, £21,200,000,\r\nbeing the average annual amount of the Government remittance during\r\nthree years, which corresponds to the alleged political drain of\r\n£30,000,000; and, secondly, £2,700,000, the average annual amount of\r\nprivate remittances during the same period, which total has been most\r\ncarefully examined and corresponds to the alleged commercial drain of\r\n£40,000,000. Now let us examine for a moment the nature of these two\r\nremittances. The Government remittance is mainly for the payment of home\r\ncharges--namely, those charges in England which are normally met from\r\nrevenue. These charges, in the three years to which I have referred,\r\naveraged £18,250,000, made up in the following manner:--Interest on\r\ndebt, £9,600,000; payments for stores, ordered and purchased in this\r\ncountry, which cannot be manufactured in India, £2,500,000; pensions and\r\nfurlough pay to civil and military officers, £5,000,000; and\r\nmiscellaneous, £1,250,000. It will thus be seen that alter deducting\r\n£5,000,000 for pensions and furlough pay, the bulk of the remittance\r\nrepresents interest for railway developments and other matters with\r\nwhich the interests of the peoples of India are intimately bound up.\r\nBesides the home charges proper, certain sums were remitted to England\r\nby the Government to defray capital charges. These bring the Government\r\nremittances to the total of £21,200,000 already mentioned. Now let us\r\nturn for a moment to the supposed commercial drain of £40,000,000 per\r\nyear, which, as I have endeavoured to show, is in reality £2,700,000,\r\nbeing the difference during the period referred to between the private\r\nremittances from India, representing private profits, savings, &c., sent\r\nhome to England, and the private remittances to India representing the\r\ntransmission of English capital to that country. We can therefore say\r\ndefinitely that whatever India may have sent to England within the three\r\nyears, she received from England as capital a sum falling short of that\r\namount by £2,700,000 a year; and perhaps I might incidentally remind the\r\nHouse that at the end of 1907 the capital outlay on railways alone in\r\nIndia amounted to £265,000,000 sterling, the bulk of which is British\r\ncapital, but by no means represents the full amount of British capital\r\ninvested in India, which has taken its part in commercially developing\r\nits resources and providing employment for the masses of people in that\r\ngreat continent. Hon. members who have followed a recent discussion in\r\nthe pages of the _Economist_ as to whether £300,000,000 or £500,000,000\r\nwas the amount of British capital invested in India for its commercial\r\nand industrial development and for providing employment of the people in\r\nthat land, will agree that the sum could not be placed lower than\r\n£350,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nNOTE 23\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE VICEROY.\r\n\r\nThis issue was raised, for instance, during the Viceroyalty of Lord\r\nNorthbrook, when Lord Salisbury was Secretary of State, Mr. Bernard\r\nMallett's memoir of Lord Northbrook contains the following noteworthy\r\nremarks upon the subject by Lord Cramer, who, as Major Baring, was\r\nPrivate Secretary to Lord Northbrook:--\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Lord Salisbury's idea was to conduct the\r\ngovernment of India to a very large extent by private correspondence\r\nbetween the Secretary of State and the Viceroy. He was disposed to\r\nneglect and, I also think, to underrate the value of the views of the\r\nAnglo-Indian officials ... This idea inevitably tended to bring the\r\nViceroy into the same relation to the Secretary of State for India as\r\nthat in which an Ambassador or Minister at a foreign Court stands to the\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs ... Lord Northbrook's general\r\nview was the exact opposite of all this, and I am strongly convinced\r\nthat he was quite right ... He recognized the subordinate position of\r\nthe Viceroy, but he held that Parliament had conferred certain rights\r\nnot only on the Viceroy but on his Council which differentiated them in\r\na very notable degree from subordinate officials such as those in the\r\ndiplomatic service ... Lord Northbrook regarded the form of government\r\nin India as a very wise combination which enabled both purely English\r\nand Anglo-Indian experience to be brought to bear on the treatment of\r\nIndian questions. He did not by any means always follow the Indian\r\nofficial view; but he held strongly, in the first place, that to put\r\naside that view and not to accord to the two Councils in London and\r\nCalcutta their full rights was unconstitutional in this sense that,\r\nthough the form might be preserved, the spirit of the Act of Parliament\r\nregulating the government of India would be evaded. In the second place,\r\nhe held that for a Viceroy or a Secretary of State without Indian\r\nexperience to overrule those who possessed such experience was an\r\nextremely unwise proceeding, and savoured of an undue exercise of that\r\nautocratic power of which he himself was very unjustly accused.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 24\r\n\r\nTHE DIFFICULTIES OF LOYAL HINDUS.\r\n\r\nA Hindu gentleman who has taken a considerable part in the struggle\r\nagainst Brahmanical disloyalty and intolerance in the Deccan has sent me\r\na copy of a letter addressed to the _Times of India_ in which he\r\nexplains the peculiar difficulties with which loyal Hindus find\r\nthemselves confronted:--\r\n\r\nEnglishmen hardly appreciate the true magnitude of the difficulties we\r\nhave to contend with in any attempt to expose sedition. All the social\r\nforces that exist in Hindu society run counter to anti-Brahminical\r\nmovements. The influence which the Brahmins exercise on the popular mind\r\nis still considerable. A man who is damned by the village-priest or the\r\nBrahmin kulkarni is doomed for good. Loyalty has been rendered odious to\r\nthe ordinary mind by this as well as by many other influences. Loyalty\r\nis flattery. This is a dictum now almost universally recognized in the\r\nDeccan. A supporter of the Government is a \"Johukum,\" a \"hireling,\" or a\r\n\"traitor.\" The Press has of late become sufficiently powerful to make or\r\nmar the reputation of a man so far as the native public is concerned.\r\nEvery advocate of Government measures--even of the best of them--is held\r\nup to ridicule by the Press. This is immediately reflected in the most\r\nexaggerated form in what we may call public opinion in the land.\r\nCertainly very great courage is necessary in one who is called upon to\r\nbear calumny such as this from his society and his castemen. But there\r\nare other forces more threatening still. The rowdier section of the\r\npeople never fails to hoot the man out on every possible occasion and\r\neven the women of his family may be subjected to indignities. The vakils\r\nare a very powerful class in the Deccan. Many of them do not openly\r\ndabble in politics; but you can hardly find many among them who do not\r\nsympathize with extremist politics. The landholders, traders and\r\nagriculturists in general are always in need of the services or, as they\r\nthink, of the favour of the legal profession whose prejudices will never\r\nbe wounded by the classes mentioned. The vakils, I may say, are to be\r\npropitiated by every one who wishes to conduct any public movement. But\r\na loyal movement can never save itself from condemnation at the hands of\r\nthis powerful class.\r\n\r\nAlthough reluctantly, I must add that the lower services of the\r\nGovernment are filled by men who passively help extremism. They form the\r\nbulk of the total constituency of our public Press. That is a fact to\r\nshow their political inclinations. Even they do not hesitate to use\r\ntheir little arts to worry a man known to be \"anti-political\" whenever\r\nhe happens to come in contact with them. An agriculturist friend of mine\r\nwho belonged to the caste to which I have the honour to belong once\r\ncame to me and asked me why I was taking a particular step connected\r\nwith the political movements in Kolhapur. The reason he gave for his\r\nattempt to dissuade me from participation in any anti-Brahmanical\r\nmovement was that every Jain would be put to immense trouble in his\r\ndealings with pleaders and clerks simply because another Jain (in this\r\ninstance myself) was against the leaders of their caste! Another class\r\nwhich always forms a check on a pro-government man is composed of the\r\nchiefs, sirdars, landholders, &c., who belong to the agitators' caste\r\nand who certainly cherish admiration for the doings of the \"patriots.\"\r\nMany of us have to come in contact with some one or other belonging to\r\nthis class and if he be known to favour anything against the great\r\nfigures of the city-politics, his business is sure to be spoilt.\r\n\r\nThis is in brief the doleful tale of the loyalist in the Deccan. I shall\r\nbriefly touch upon one or two things with reference to what will\r\nstrengthen the hands of the loyal citizen. The first thing is that the\r\nGovernment should boldly come forward to help on the coming into\r\nexistence of a bigger class of educated men among the backward or lower\r\nclasses of the Deccan. The suspicion that they too will join hands with\r\nthe agitator must vanish once for all. The half-heartedness due to such\r\nlurking suspicion gives a fine tool in the hands of Government's\r\nenemies. The English people should realize the probable danger of this\r\nand should use their vast resources to create a strong body of educated\r\nmen from the ranks of the loyal castes. H.H. the Maharaja of Kolhapur,\r\nin his attempts to break down Brahmanical supremacy, found nothing so\r\nuseful as the bringing into being of such a class and for this he is\r\ndoing the best he can. Unless this example is followed by the\r\nGovernment, there is no hope of a strong loyal party coming forth to\r\ncombat the evil work done by Extremists. The strengthening of the loyal\r\nPress such as it exists and adding to it is another measure the\r\nGovernment might wisely adopt.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 25\r\n\r\nHINDU THEORIES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen are apt to ignore the hold which ancient Hindu traditions\r\nconcerning the rights and duties of kingship and the old Hindu theories\r\nof government derived from the sacred books of Hinduism still have on\r\nthe Indian mind. They have been recently reviewed in an article\r\ncontributed to _The Times_ from a very scholarly pen.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Hindu theory of government is fully disclosed in the\r\n_Mahabharata_, the most majestic work ever produced by the human\r\nintellect, a work, too, which is to-day as popular with Indians as when\r\n40 centuries ago it was chanted to instruct the youth and beguile the\r\ntedium of the princes of Hastinapura. Unlike all systems of government\r\nknown to the West, the Hindu system contains no popular element\r\nwhatever. In it we find no Witanagemote in which the nobles may advise\r\nthe monarch; still less has it any place for a _comitia centuriata_,\r\nwith its stormy masses of spearmen, to scrutinize and control the\r\nencroachments of the Royal prerogative. In the kingdoms described In the\r\n_Mahabharata_ the inhabitants are rigidly divided into four wholly\r\ndistinct and separate classes (_Udhyog Parva_, p. 67, Roy's\r\ntranslation). First come the Brahmans whose duty it is to study, to\r\nteach, to minister at sacrifices--receiving in return gifts from,\r\n\"known\" or, as we should say, respectable persons. Then follow the\r\n_Kshattriyas_ or the warrior class, whose whole life has to be spent in\r\nfighting and in warlike exercises. Thirdly come the _Vaisyas_ who\r\nacquire merit by accumulating wealth through commerce, cattle-breeding,\r\nand agriculture. Fourthly, we have the _Sudras_, or serfs, who are bound\r\nto obey the other three classes, but who are forbidden to study their\r\nscriptures or partake in their sacrifices.\r\n\r\nHigh over all classes is the King. He is the living symbol of strength\r\nand power. He is \"the tiger among men,\" the \"bull of the Bharata race,\"\r\nand his form and features bear the visible impress of the Most High. The\r\nwhole arduous business of government rests on his shoulders. He cannot\r\nappeal to his subjects to help him in carrying out good administration\r\nnor can he leave his duties to others. For to beseech and to renounce\r\nare both against the laws of his order (_Vana Parva_, p. 457). At the\r\nutmost he can employ counsellors to advise him, but their numbers must\r\nnever exceed eight (_Çanti Parva_, p. 275). In any case they only tender\r\nadvice when asked (_Udhyog Parva_, p. 100), and the full responsibility\r\nof all acts rests on the King only. It is he who must keep up the\r\narsenals, the depôts, the camps, the stables for the cavalry, the lines\r\nfor the elephants, and replenish the military storehouses with bows and\r\narrows. It is he who must maintain in efficient repair his six different\r\nkinds of citadels--his water citadels, his earth citadels, his hill\r\ncitadels, his human citadels, his forest citadels, and his mud citadels\r\n(_Çanti Parva_, p. 277). It is he who must see that the capital has\r\nabundant provisions, impassable trenches, impenetrable walls; that it\r\nteems with elephants, cavalry horses, and war chariots. He must maintain\r\nan efficient staff of spies to ascertain the strength of neighbouring\r\nmonarchs and do his utmost to cause dissension among their servants\r\n(_Çanti Parva_, p. 224). The War Office and the Foreign Office are alike\r\nunder his immediate headship. It is for him to conclude treaties, to\r\nlead to battle his armies, and during peace to keep them prepared for\r\nwar (_Çanti Parva_, p. 228). But the duty which comes before all others\r\nis to protect his subjects. That, indeed, is imposed on him as a\r\nreligious duty. \"For having protected his Kingdom a King becomes\r\nsanctified and finally sports in Heaven\" (_Çanti Parva_, p. 68).\r\n\"Whether he does or does not do any other religious acts, if only he\r\nprotects his subjects he is thought to accomplish all religion.\"\r\n(ibid., p. 193).\r\n\r\nIn return for the proper discharge of his innumerable tasks, he is\r\nregarded by his subjects as the incarnation of Indra. He is entitled to\r\na sixth share of the gross revenue of the country. Fearful penalties\r\nattach to the infringement of his rights. \"That man who even thinks of\r\ndoing an injury to the King meets with grief here and Hell hereafter\"\r\n(_Çanti Parva_, p. 221). \"He will be destroyed like a deer that has\r\ntaken poison.\" On the other hand, should the King fail to meet his\r\nobligations--and above all, if he does not protect his subjects--he\r\noffends grievously, \"These persons should be avoided like a leaky boat\r\non the sea, a preceptor who does not speak, a priest who has not studied\r\nthe Scriptures, a King who does not grant protection\" (_Çanti Parva_, p.\r\n176). \"A King who does not protect his kingdom takes upon himself a\r\nquarter of its sins\" (_Drona Parva_, p. 625). In the last resort his\r\nsubjects will be freed from their allegiance. \"If a powerful King\r\napproaches kingdoms torn by anarchy from desire of annexing them to his\r\ndominions the people should go forward and receive the invader with\r\nrespect.\"\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner the entire civil administration must be conducted\r\nby the King. He must see to it that wide roads, shops, and water\r\nconduits are constructed. He must look after the streets and by-paths.\r\nHe must treat all classes impartially, and, above all, scrutinize\r\ncarefully the work of the Courts of Justice. \"The penal code properly\r\napplied by the ruler maketh the warders [i.e., Judges] adhere to their\r\nrespective duties, and leadeth to an acquisition by the ruler himself of\r\nvirtue.\" (_Udhyog Parva,_ p. 383). But although the subjects have the\r\nright to expect justice they cannot expect kindness or even easy\r\ncondescension. \"The heart of a King is as hard as thunder\" _(Çanti\r\nParva,_ p. 57). \"Knowledge makes a man proud, but the King makes him\r\nhumble\" _(Çanti Parva,_ p. 223). \"When the King rules with a complete\r\nand strict reliance on the science of chastisements, the foremost of\r\nages called the Kirta is said to set in\" (ibid., p. 228). \"The King\r\nmust be skilful in smiting\" (ibid., p. 174). \"Fierceness and ambition\r\nare the qualities of the King\" (ibid., p. 59). \"The King who is mild\r\nis regarded as the worst of his kind, like an elephant that is reft of\r\nfierceness\" (ibid., p. 171). Indeed, failure to treat subjects with\r\nrigour is visited with penalties as tremendous as failure to protect\r\nthem. \"They forget their own position and most truly transcend it. They\r\ndisclose the secret counsels of their master; without the least anxiety\r\nthey set at nought the King's commands. They wish to sport with the King\r\nas with a bird on a string\" (ibid., p. 172). And in the end they\r\ndestroy him. \"The King should always be heedful of his subjects as also\r\nof his foes. If he becomes heedless they fall on him like vultures upon\r\ncarrion\" (_Çanti Parva,_ p. 289).\r\n\r\nHere we have commended as a pattern of administration a despotism such\r\nas the West has never experienced. It is inquisitorial,\r\nsevere--sometimes, perhaps, wantonly cruel. But from the fearful\r\npitfalls that encompass weakness it is certain to be sleeplessly\r\nvigilant and in the highest degree virile, forceful, and efficient. Now\r\nit will be asked what bearing the doctrines of a work four thousand\r\nyears old have on the problems of the present day. But it must be\r\nremembered, as that eminent scholar, the late Mr. Jackson, the victim of\r\nthe abominable Nasik outrage, pointed out, that Hindu civilization and\r\nHindu thought are at bottom the same now as in the days of Yudhisthira.\r\n\r\nThe _Mahabharata_ is the constant companion from youth to age of every\r\neducated Indian. Its tales have provided matter for the poetry, the\r\ndrama, and the folk-songs of all ages and of all languages. No Hindu\r\nwill live in a house facing south, as it is there that lives Yama, the\r\ngod of death. No Hindu will go to sleep without murmuring _Takshaka_ as\r\na preventive against snake-bite. For Takshaka rescued the snakes from\r\nthe vengeance of Janamajaya, the great-grandson of the _Mahabharata_\r\nhero Arjuna. The independent Indian Princes conduct their administration\r\nexactly on the lines indicated in the _Mahabharata_, and even States as\r\nenlightened as Baroda and Kolhapur still adhere to the Council of eight\r\nMinisters recommended in that immortal work. Indeed, its teachings\r\nreally explain the puzzle of Indian loyalty to the British Government.\r\nAccording to Western ideas, no amount of _pax Britannica_ would\r\ncompensate the conquered for foreign rule. The Poles still sigh for the\r\nbad old days of independence and misrule, and are in no way comforted by\r\nthe efficiency of German administration. But the Indian's allegiance to\r\nhis native kings was, as the _Mahabharata_, lays down, released by their\r\nweakness, and he readily transferred his loyalty to those who, although\r\nforeign, had yet shown that they could govern vigorously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n   Acts of Parliament:\r\n     Age of Consent Act (1891),42, 75.\r\n     Charter Act (1833), 307, 308, 310.\r\n     Explosive Substances Act (1908), 98.\r\n     Government of India Act (1858), 307, 310.\r\n     Indian Councils Act (1909), 10, 100, 120, 162-175.\r\n     Indian Newspapers (Incitement\r\n     to Offences) Act, (1908), 96, 98.\r\n     Press Act (1910), 15, 98-99,335-337.\r\n     Punjab Land Alienation Act (1900), 156.\r\n     Summary Justice Act (1908), 98.\r\n     Universities Act (1904), 78,2, 229.\r\n\r\n   Administration of British India,\r\n     comparison of the total\r\n     number of Englishmen and\r\n     Indians employed in, 293.\r\n\r\n   Aga Khan, 132, 133.\r\n\r\n   Age of Consent Act, 1891,42, 75.\r\n\r\n   Agriculture, the greatest of\r\n     all Indian industries, 259;\r\n     need for practical education in, 262.\r\n\r\n   Ahmad, Sir Syed, 122, 131.\r\n\r\n   Aitchison, Sir Charles, 213.\r\n\r\n   Ajit Singh, proceedings against, 112.\r\n\r\n   _Akash_, newspaper, Delhi, 21.\r\n\r\n   Ali, Mr. Ameer, 132.\r\n\r\n   All-India Moslem League, 131,132, 281.\r\n\r\n   All-India Temperance Conference, 200.\r\n\r\n   America, Indian revolutionary\r\n      organizations in, 146, 147.\r\n\r\n   Anglo-Russian Agreement, 319.\r\n\r\n   \"Animists,\" 177.\r\n\r\n   Anti Cow-killing Society, founded by Tilak in 1893, 43.\r\n\r\n   _Anusilan Samiti_ Society, 99.\r\n\r\n   Army, Indian, position of Indians in, 328.\r\n\r\n   Arya Samaj, 27;
