HORACE GREELEY,\r\nHENRY T. TUCKERMAN, REV. F. W. SHELTON, RICHARD B. KIMBALL, BAYARD\r\nTAYLOR, J. WARREN NEWCOMB, JR., HENRY P. LELAND, THE AUTHOR OF \"THE\r\nCOTTON STATES,\" CHARLES G. LELAND, and CHARLES F. BROWNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1801, by JAMES R.\r\nGILMORE, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nPress of Geo. C. Rand & Avery, 3 Cornhill, Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SITUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, 1860, culminated the plot against our National\r\nexistence. The conspiracy originated in South Carolina, and had a\r\ngrowth, more or less checked by circumstances, of over thirty years.\r\n\r\nFor John C. Calhoun had conceived the idea of an independent position\r\nfor that State some time previous to the passage of the 'nullification\r\nordinance' in November, 1832. This man, although he bore no resemblance\r\nin personal qualities to the Roman conspirator, is chargeable with the\r\nsame crime which Cicero urged against Cataline--that of 'corrupting the\r\nyouth.' His mind was too logical to adopt the ordinary propositions\r\nabout slavery, such as, 'a great but necessary evil;' 'we did not plant\r\nit, and now we have it, we can't get rid of it,' and the like; but,\r\nplacing his back to the wall where it was impossible to outflank him, he\r\ndefended it, by all the force of his subtle intellect, as a permanent\r\ninstitution. His followers refined on their master's lessons, and\r\nasserted that it was one of the pillars on which a republic must rest!\r\nHere was the origin of the most wicked and most audacious plot ever\r\nattempted against any government. This plot did not involve any contest\r\nfor political power in the administration of public affairs. That, the\r\nSouthern leaders already possessed, but with that they were not content.\r\nThey were determined to destroy the Republic itself,--to literally blot\r\nit out of existence. And why? What could betray intelligent and educated\r\nmen, persons esteemed wise in their generation, into an attempt which\r\namazes the civilized world, and at which posterity will be appalled? We\r\nanswer, it was the old leaven which has worked always industriously in\r\nthe breast of man since the creation--AMBITION. Corrupted by\r\nthe idea that a model republic must have slavery for its basis, knowing\r\nthat the free States could not much longer tolerate the theory, certain\r\nleading individuals decided to dismember the country. They cast their\r\neyes across Texas to the fertile plains of Mexico, and so southward.\r\nThey indulged in the wildest dreams of conquest and of empire. The whole\r\nsouthern continent would in time be occupied and under their control. An\r\naristocracy was to be built up, on which possibly a monarchy would be\r\nengrafted. In this way a new feudal system was to be developed, negro\r\nfor serf, and a race of noble creatures spring forth, the admirable of\r\nthe earth, whose men should be famed as the world's chivalry, and whose\r\nwomen should be the most beautiful and most accomplished of all the\r\ndaughters of Eve. The peaceful drudge and artisan of the North, ox-like\r\nin their character, should serve them as they might require, and the\r\ncraven man of commerce should buy and sell for their accommodation. For\r\nthe rest, the negro would suffice. This was the extraordinary scheme of\r\nthe South Carolina 'aristocrat,' and with which he undertook to infect\r\ncertain unscrupulous leaders throughout the cotton and sugar States. It\r\nwas no part of the plan of the conspirators to precipitate the border\r\nStates into rebellion. O no! On the contrary, it was specially set forth\r\nin the programme entrusted to the exclusive few, that those States were\r\nto remain in the 'Old Union' as a fender between the 'South' and the\r\nfree States; always ready in Congress to stand up for a good fugitive\r\nslave law, and various other little privileges, and prepared to threaten\r\nsecession if Congress did not yield just what was demanded. In this way\r\nthe free States would be perpetually entangled by embarrassing\r\nquestions, and the new empire left to pursue unrestricted its dazzling\r\nplans of conquest and occupation.\r\n\r\nA comfortable arrangement truly, and one very easy of\r\naccomplishment,--provided the free States would consent.\r\n\r\n'Certainly they will consent. Trade, commerce, manufactures and\r\nmechanical pursuits, occupy them exclusively, and these promise better\r\nresults under the new order of things than under the old. As to\r\npatriotism or public spirit, the North have neither. The people do not\r\neven resent a personal affront, much less will they go to war for an\r\nidea.'\r\n\r\nSo reasoned the South.\r\n\r\n'It is not possible those fellows down yonder can be in earnest. They\r\nare only playing the game of \"brag.\" In their hearts they are really\r\ndevoted to the Union. They have not the least idea of separating from\r\nus.'\r\n\r\nSo reasoned the North.\r\n\r\nNeither side thought the other in earnest. Both were mistaken.\r\n\r\nNegro slaves were introduced into Virginia as early as 1620. In the year\r\n1786 England employed in the slave-trade 130 ships, and that year alone\r\nseized and carried from their homes into slavery 42,000 blacks.\r\nWilberforce experienced many defeats through the influence of the\r\nslave-trade interest, but at length carried his point, and the trade was\r\nfinally abolished in England in 1807,--not a very remote period\r\ncertainly. The same year witnessed the suppression of the slave-trade in\r\nour own country; but, unfortunately, not the abolition of\r\nslave-_holding_. All our readers understand how, when the Constitution\r\nof the United States was adopted, slavery was regarded entirely as a\r\ndomestic matter, left to each of the States to manage and dispose of as\r\neach saw fit. But at that period there was no dissenting voice to the\r\nproposition, that, abstractly considered, slave-holding was wrong; yet\r\nthe owner of a large number of negroes could honestly declare he was\r\nhimself innocent of the first transgression, and ignorant of any\r\npracticable way to get rid of the evil,--for it was counted an evil.\r\nWhen the rice, cotton and sugar fields demanded larger developments, it\r\nwas counted a _necessary_ evil. Congress was called on for more guards\r\nand pledges, and gave them freely. It disclaimed any power to interfere\r\nwith what had now become an institution; it had no power to do so. It\r\nwent further, and by legislation sought fully to protect the\r\nslave-holding States in the perfect enjoyment of their rights under the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile many wise and good men, North and South, who regarded slavery\r\nas a blight and a curse upon the States where it existed, endeavored by\r\nall the means in their power to prepare the way for gradual\r\nemancipation. It seemed at one time that they would succeed in Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Virginia and Kentucky. In Virginia, an emancipation act failed\r\nof passing by a single vote.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Calhoun was spreading the heresy of his state-rights\r\ndoctrine in South Carolina and taking his 'logical ground' on the\r\nslavery question, a class, then almost universally branded as fanatics,\r\nbut whose proportions have since very largely swelled, arose at the\r\nNorth, which were a match for the South Carolina senator with his own\r\nweapons. Each laid hold of an extreme point and maintained it. We refer\r\nto the Abolitionists of thirty years ago, under Garrison, Tappan & Co.\r\nThese people seized on a single idea, exclusive of any other, and went\r\nnearly mad over it. Apparently blind to the evils around them, which\r\nwere close at hand, within their own doors, swelling perhaps in their\r\nown hearts, they were suddenly 'brought to see' the 'vile enormity' of\r\nslave-holding. Their argument was very simple. 'Slavery is an awful sin\r\nin the sight of God. Slave-holders are awful sinners. We of the North,\r\nhaving made a covenant with such sinners, are equally guilty of the sin\r\nof slavery with them. Slavery must be immediately abolished. _Fiat\r\njustitia ruat coelum_. Better that the Republic fall than continue in\r\nthe unholy league one day.' These men were ready to 'dissolve the\r\nUnion,' to disintegrate the nation, to blast the hopes of perhaps\r\nmillions of persons over the world, who were watching with anxious\r\nhearts the experiment of our government, trembling lest it should fail.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina John C. Calhoun was ready to do the same. And thus\r\nextremes met.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Southern conspirators pursued their labors. Gathering up\r\nthe reports of the meetings of the Abolition Societies, and selecting\r\nthe most inflammable extracts from the speeches of the most violent,\r\nthey circulated them far and wide, as indications of the hostile spirit\r\nof the North, and as proofs of the impossibility of living under the\r\nsame government with people who were determined to destroy their\r\ndomestic institutions and stir up servile insurrections. The\r\nAbolitionists saw the alarm of the South, and pressed their advantage.\r\nThus year after year passed, till the memorable November elections of\r\n1860. The conspirators received the intelligence of the election of\r\nLincoln with grim satisfaction. The Abolitionists witnessed the progress\r\nof secession in the various States with a joy they did not attempt to\r\nconceal. 'Now we can pursue our grand scheme of empire,' exclaimed the\r\nSouthern traitors. 'Now shall we see the end of slavery,' cried the\r\nAbolitionists. Strange that neither gave a thought about the destruction\r\nof the glorious fabric which the wisest and best men, North and South,\r\ntheir own fathers, had erected. Strange, not one sigh was breathed in\r\nprospect of the death of a nation. Incredible that no misgiving checked\r\nthe exultation of either party, lest, in destroying the temple of\r\nLiberty and scattering its fragments, it might never again be\r\nreconstructed. The conspirator, South, saw only the consummation of his\r\nmad projects of ambition. The Abolitionist North, regarded only the\r\n_immediate_ emancipation of a large number of slaves, most of whom,\r\nincapable, through long servitude, of self-control, would be thrown\r\nmiserably on the world. Neither party thought or cared a jot about their\r\ncommon country. Neither regarded the stars and stripes with the least\r\nemotion. To one, it was secondary to the emblem of a sovereign State. To\r\nthe other, there was no beauty in its folds, because it waved over a\r\nrace in bondage.\r\n\r\nThe day after the battle of Bull Run found these two extremes still in\r\nsympathy. Both were still rejoicing. The rebel recognized the hand of\r\nProvidence in the victory, so did the Abolitionist: one, because it\r\nwould secure to the South its claims; the other, because it would rouse\r\nthe North to a fiercer prosecution of the war, which had hitherto been\r\nwaged with 'brotherly reluctance.' Here we leave these sympathizing\r\nextremes, and proceed to survey the situation.\r\n\r\nThe first point we note is, that in the South the war did not originate\r\nwith the people, but with certain conspirators. In the North, the mighty\r\narmament to conquer rebellion is the work of the people alone, not of a\r\ncabinet. In the South, it was with difficulty the inhabitants were\r\nprecipitated into 'secession.' Indeed, in certain States the leaders\r\ndared not risk a popular vote. In the North, the rulers, appalled by\r\nthe extraordinary magnitude of the crisis, were timid and hesitating,\r\nuntil the inhabitants rose in a body to save their national existence.\r\n\r\nIt is no answer to this assertion, that large armies are arrayed against\r\nus, which engage with animosity in the war. The die cast, the several\r\nStates committed to the side of treason, there was no alternative: fight\r\nthey must. As the devil is said to betray his victims into situations\r\nwhere they are compelled to advance from bad to worse, so the\r\nconspirators adroitly hastened the people into overt acts from which\r\nthey were told there was no retreat. We believe these facts to have had\r\ngreat influence with our Government; and in this way we can understand\r\nthe generous but mistaken forbearance of the administration in the\r\nearlier stages of the contest,--we say mistaken, because it was entirely\r\nmisunderstood by the other side, and placed to the account of cowardice,\r\nimbecility or weakness; and because there can be no middle course in\r\ncarrying on a war. We have suffered enough by it already in money and\r\nmen; we must suffer no more. Besides, we lose self-respect, and gain\r\nonly the contempt of the enemy. When the bearer of General Sherman's\r\npolite proclamation, addressed 'to the _loyal_ citizens of South\r\nCarolina,' communicated it to the two officers near Beaufort, they\r\nreplied, with courteous _nonchalance_, 'Your mission is fruitless; there\r\nare no loyal citizens in the State.' The general's action in the\r\npremises reminds us of that of a worthy clergyman who gave notice that\r\nin the morning of the following Sunday he would preach to the young, in\r\nthe afternoon to the old, in the evening to sinners. The two first\r\nservices were respectably attended; to the last, not a soul came.\r\n\r\nThere are no 'sinners' in South Carolina, and General Sherman had better\r\ntry his hand at something else besides paper persuasions. At all events,\r\nwe suggest that future proclamations be addressed to those for whom such\r\ndocuments are usually framed, to wit, rebels in arms against constituted\r\nauthority.[1]\r\n\r\nBut to our case. We have a rebellion to crush,--a rebellion large in its\r\nproportions, threatening in its aspect, but lacking in elements of real\r\nstrength, and liable to collapse at any moment. To put down this\r\nrebellion is the sole object and purpose of the war. We are not fighting\r\nto enrich a certain number of army contractors, nor to give employment\r\nto half a million of soldiers, or promotion to the officers who command\r\nthem. Neither are we fighting to emancipate the slaves. It is true the\r\narmy contractors do get rich, the half million of soldiers are employed,\r\nthe officers who command them receive advancement, and the slaves _may_\r\nbe liberated. But this is not what we fight _for_. On this head the\r\npeople have made no mistake. In the outset they proclaimed that this war\r\nwas to decide the question of government or no government, country or no\r\ncountry, national existence or no national existence. And we must go\r\nstraight to this mark. We have nothing to do with any issue except how\r\nto save the nation. If this shall require the emancipation of every\r\nnegro in the Southern States, then every negro must be emancipated. And\r\nthis brings us to another proposition, to wit, that the day is past for\r\ndiscussing this slave question in a corner. This bug-bear of\r\npoliticians, this ancient annoyance to the Northern Democrat and the\r\nSouthern old-line Whig, this colored Banquo, will no longer 'down.' We\r\ncan no longer affect ignorance of the spectre's presence. It is forced\r\non us in the house and by the way. It follows the march of our armies.\r\nIt is present at the occupation of our Southern ports and towns and\r\nvillages. Martial law is impotent to deal with it. It frightens by its\r\nugly shadow our Secretary of War; in vain our good President tries to\r\navoid it; in vain we adopt new terms, talk about contrabands, and the\r\nlike; the inevitable African will present himself, and we are compelled\r\nto recognize him.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding we fight for no other end than to save the Republic, we\r\nare absolutely driven into the consideration of the slave question,\r\nbecause it involves the very existence of any republic. This question is\r\nnot whether bondage is to cease throughout the world; but whether it is\r\ncompatible with a free government, such as we claim our own to be. In\r\nother words, is Slavery in the United States to-day on trial? We must\r\n_all_ abandon our morbid sensitiveness and come squarely to the\r\nconsideration of the vital point, to wit, can this great Republic be\r\nheld together while the 'peculiar system' exists in a part of it? No\r\nmatter who first posed this ugly query,--Calhoun or Garrison. We have\r\nnow to answer it. We dare not, we can not, we will not give up our\r\ncountry to disunion and severance. To save it has already cost us an eye\r\nand a hand, and now this unhappy subject must be disposed of, disposed\r\nof honestly, conscientiously, with the temper of men who feel that the\r\n_principle_ of our government is soon to fail or triumph. If to fail,\r\nthe cause would seem to be lost forever. What then? Why only a monarchy\r\non our Southern border, insolent provinces on our Northern; Spain\r\nstrengthened in her position, and recovering her lost ground; Mexico an\r\nempire; England audacious and overbearing as of yore, and France joining\r\nto fill our waters with mighty naval armaments. _We_, having witnessed\r\nthe dismemberment of our country, and possessing no longer a\r\nnationality, but broken into fragments, to become the jest and\r\nlaughingstock of the world, which would point to us and say, 'These\r\npeople began to build, and were not able to finish!'\r\n\r\nHow do you fancy the picture? Do you think any morbid delicacy, any fear\r\nof giving offense to our 'loyal Southern brethren,' should prevent our\r\nexamining this slave question? We raise, be it understood, no foregone\r\nconclusion, we do not even pronounce on the result of the examination;\r\nbut examine it we must. Not the President, with his honest desire to\r\npreserve every guaranteed right to the South; not the Secretary of\r\nState, who unites the qualities of a timid man with those of a radical,\r\nand who is therefore by instinct temporizing and 'diplomatic;' not any\r\nother member of the cabinet, dare longer attempt to slide over or around\r\nit. We observe, we venture on no conclusion in advance. We are not\r\nprepared to say, if the South in a body should seek now to return to\r\ntheir allegiance, that they could not hedge in and save their\r\n'institution.' But we should still desire to discuss the subject\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\nSo long as slavery was tolerated as a domestic custom long established\r\nand difficult to deal with, it stood in the list of permitted evils\r\nwhich all condemn, yet which it seems impossible to get rid of. But it\r\nis one thing to _tolerate_ an evil, quite another to adopt it as a good.\r\nAnd we declare that never in the world's history was there an attempt so\r\nshameless and audacious as that to found a government on slavery as a\r\ncornerstone! Is it possible to conceive of more ungoverned depravity or\r\na madness more complete?[2]\r\n\r\nThere have been contests innumerable on the earth. We read of wars for\r\nconquest, to avenge national insults, about disputed territory, against\r\nrevolted provinces, and between dynasties; civil wars, religious wars,\r\nwars for the succession, to preserve the balance of power, and so forth.\r\nBut never before was a war inaugurated to _establish_ slavery as a\r\nprinciple of the government. We can predict no other fate for the\r\nleaders in this diabolical plot than discomfiture and defeat. We have\r\nan unwavering faith that the Republic will come out of this contest\r\nstronger than ever before; that it will become a light to lighten the\r\nnations, the hope of the lovers of liberty everywhere. But we will not\r\nanticipate.\r\n\r\nIn periods like the present, circumstances appear to be charged with\r\nvital and intelligent properties, working out and solving problems which\r\nhave disturbed and puzzled the wisest and most astute. At such times\r\nimpertinent intermeddlers abound, who claim to interpret the oracles,\r\nand who would hasten the birth of events by acting as midwife. It is\r\nimpossible to dispose of or silence such people. We should be careful\r\nthat we are not misled by their egregious pretensions. The fact is, the\r\nwhole history of our race should teach us a lesson of profound humility.\r\nWe do not accomplish half so much for ourselves as is accomplished for\r\nus. True, we have something to do. The seed will not grow if it be not\r\nplanted; but all our skill and cunning can not make it spring up and\r\nblossom, and bear fruit in perfection. Neither can man work out events\r\nafter a plan of his own. He is made, in the grand drama of this world,\r\nto work out the designs of the Almighty. We must accept this or accept\r\nnothing. In this light how futile are the intemperate ravings of one\r\nclass, the unreasonable complaints of another, the cunning plots of a\r\nthird. We see no escape from a threatening danger, we perceive no path\r\nout of a labyrinthine maze of evil; when, lo! through some apparently\r\ntrifling incident, by some slight and insignificant occurrence, the\r\nwhole order of things is changed, the impending danger vanishes, and we\r\nthread the labyrinth with ease.\r\n\r\nWe believe God will provide us a way out of our present troubles. Only\r\nwe must do our duty, which is to maintain our common country, our flag,\r\nthe Republic ENTIRE.\r\n\r\nThus much at present. Where this war is to carry us, what shall be its\r\neffect on us as a people, what great changes are in progress, and what\r\nmay result from them, we will discuss at the proper time, in a future\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIS PROGRESS A TRUTH?\r\n\r\n\r\n  'Human nature has been the same in all ages.'\r\n  'Men are pretty much the same wherever you find them.'\r\n\r\nIf there be anything in this world from which it would be desirable to\r\nsee men delivered, it is from a certain small, cheap wisdom which\r\nexpresses itself in general verdicts on all humanity, and enables the\r\nfribbler or dolt who can not see beyond his nose to give an offhand\r\nsummary of the infinite. There is 'an aping of the devil' in this\r\nflippant assumption of our immutability, which strangely combines the\r\npitiful and painful. Oh! if the _ne plus ultra_ which antique Ignorance\r\ncomplacently inscribes on the gates of its world should ever be worn\r\naway, let it be replaced by this owlish _credo_ in the unchangeableness\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nThe refutation of these sayings has been the history of humanity, and\r\nyet no argument on political or social topics fails to contain them in\r\none form or another. Even now, in the tremendous debate maintained by\r\ncommon logic and 'fist law' between our North and South, we find them\r\nenunciated with a clearness and precision unequaled in any state paper,\r\nunless we except that in which William the Conqueror coolly styled\r\nhimself king 'by the right of the sword.' Science, which modestly\r\nannounces itself as incomplete the nearer it approaches completion, has\r\nbeen assumed to be perfect by those most ignorant of it, in order that\r\nits mere observations as to climate and races may be found to prove\r\nthat as man is, so he was in all ages, and so must be, 'forever and\r\nforever as we rove.' Races now vanished in the twilight of time have\r\nbeen boldly declared to be the prototypes of others, now themselves\r\nchanging into new forms, and we, unconsciously, like the old Hebrew in\r\nHeine's Italy, repeat curses over the ancient graves of long-departed\r\nfoes--ignorant that those curses were long since fulfilled by the\r\nunconquerable and terrible laws which ever hurry us onward and upward,\r\nfrom everlasting to everlasting, from the first Darkness to the infinite\r\nword of Light.\r\n\r\nThe assumption that mankind always has been and will be the same,\r\ninvolves the conclusion that the elements of slavery and scoundrelism,\r\nof suffering and of disorder, are immutable in essence and in\r\nproportion, and that human exertion wastes itself in vain when it\r\naspires to anything save a rank in the upper ten millions. As for the\r\nmass,--'tis a great pity,--_mais, que voulez vous?_ It is the fortune of\r\nlife's war; and then who knows? Perhaps they are as happy in their\r\nsphere as anybody. Only see how they dance! And then they\r\ndrink--gracious goodness, how they swig it off! the gay creatures!\r\nOh,'tis a very fine world, gentlemen, especially if you whitewash it\r\nwell, and keep up a plenty of Potemkin card cottages along the road\r\nwhich winds through the wilderness. But above all--never forget that\r\nthey--drink.\r\n\r\nIt was well enough for a stormy past, but it may not be so well for the\r\nfuture, that man is prone to hero-worship. Under circumstances, varying,\r\nhowever, immensely, be it observed, humanity has produced Menus,\r\nConfuciuses, Platos, Ciceros, Sidneys, Spinozas, scholars and gentlemen,\r\nand the ordinary student, seeing them all through a Claude Lorraine\r\nglass of modern tinting, thinks them on the whole wonderfully like\r\nhimself. Horace chaffs with Cæsar and Mæcenas, Martial quizzes the world\r\nand the reader very much as modern club-men and poets would do. It is\r\nvery convenient to forget how much they have been imitated; still more\r\nso to ignore that in both are stores of recondite mode and feeling as\r\nyet unpenetrated by any scholar of these days. You think, my brave\r\n_Artium Baccalaureus_, that you feel all that Hafiz felt,--surely he\r\ntoped and bussed like a good fellow of all times,--and yet for seven\r\ncenturies the most embracing of scholars have folioed and disputed over\r\nthe real meaning of that Song of Solomon which is now first beginning to\r\nbe understood from Hafiz. Man, I tell you that in the old morning of\r\nhistory there were races whose life-blood glowed hotter than ever yours\r\ndid, with a burning faith, such as you never felt, that all which you\r\nnow believe to be most execrably infamous was intensely holy. Your\r\nwisest scholars lose themselves in trying to unthread the mazes and\r\nmysteries of those incomprehensible depths of diabolical worship and\r\nintertwined beauty and honor, now known only from trebly diminished\r\nmythologic reflection. Perhaps some of those undecipherable hieroglyphs\r\nof the East are not so unintelligible to you now as they would be if\r\ntranslated. Do you, for that matter, fully understand why a Hindu yoghi\r\ntorments himself for thirty years? I observe that the great majority of\r\nour good, kind missionaries have no glimmering of an idea why it is\r\ndone. Brother Zeal, of the first part, says it is superstition. Father\r\nSqueal, of the second part, says it is the devil. Very good indeed--so\r\nfar as it goes.\r\n\r\nBut look to later ages, and see whether man has been so strikingly\r\nsimilar to us of the present day. There are manias and mysteries of the\r\nMiddle Ages whose history is smothered in darkness; lost to us out of\r\nsheer incapacity to be understood from any modern standpoint of sense or\r\nfeeling whatever. What do you make out of that crusade of scores of\r\nthousands of unarmed, delirious Christians, who started eastward to\r\nredeem the holy sepulchre; all their faith and hope of safety being in a\r\ngoose and a pig which they bore with them? And they all died, those\r\nearnest Goose-and-Pigites; died in untold misery and murder--unhappy\r\n'superstition again.' That bolt is soon shot; but I have my misgivings\r\nwhether it reaches the mark.\r\n\r\nOr what do you make of untold and unutterable horrors, or crimes, as\r\nthey were deemed, which to us seem bewildering nonsense? What of\r\nwere-wolf manias, of districts made horrible by nightmare and\r\nvampyreism, urged to literal and incredible reality; of abominations\r\nwhich no modern wickedness dare hint at, but which raged like epidemics?\r\nOr what of the Sieur de Gilles, with his thousand or two of girl\r\nchildren elaborately tortured to death--and he a type and not a sporad?\r\n\r\n'But,' we are told, 'men would do all this over again, if they dared.\r\nThe vice is all here, safely housed away snug as ever, only waiting its\r\ntime.' I grant it--just as I grant that the same atoms and elements\r\nwhich once formed mastodons and trilobites are here--and with about as\r\nmuch chance of reappearing as mastodons as humanity has of reproducing\r\nthose antique horrors. The fragments of witch-madness and star-faith may\r\nbe still raked in tolerably perfect lumps out of the mire or chaff of\r\nmankind; but I do not think, young lady, that you will ever be accused\r\nof riding on a broom, though you unquestionably had an ancestress,\r\nsomewhere before or after Hengist, who enjoyed the reputation of\r\nunderstanding that unpopular mode of volatility. _Pommade Dupuytren_ and\r\n_Eau de toilette_ have taken the place of the witch-ointments; and if\r\nthe spice-powder of the old alchemist Mutio di Frangipani has risen from\r\nthe recipes of the Middle Ages into modern fashion, rest assured that it\r\nwill never work wonder more, save in connection with bright eyes,\r\nrustling fans, and Valenciennes-edged pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nTo the student to whom all battles of the past are not like the dishes\r\nof certain Southern hotels,--all served in the same gravy, possessing\r\nthe same agrarian, muttony flavor,--and to whom Zoroaster and Spurgeon\r\nare not merely clergymen, differing only in dress and language, it must\r\nappear plain enough that as there are now on earth races physically\r\ndiffering from one another almost as much as from other mammalia, just\r\nso in the course of ages have been developed in the same single descent\r\neven greater mental and moral differences. In fact, when we remember\r\nthat the same lust, avarice, ambition and warfare have mingled with our\r\nblood at all times, it becomes wonderful when we reflect how marvelously\r\nthe mind has been molded to such myriad varieties. It has in full\r\nconsciousness of its power sacrificed all earthly happiness, toiled and\r\ndied for rulers, for ideas of which it had no idea, for vague\r\nwar-cries--it has existed only for sensuality, or beauty, or food--for\r\nreligion or for ostentation, according to different climate or age or\r\nsoil--it has groveled for ages in misery or roamed free and proud--and\r\nbetween the degraded slave and the proud free-man there is, as I think,\r\na very terrible difference indeed. But, quitting the vast variety of\r\nmental developments, faiths, and _feelings_, let us cast a glance on the\r\ngeneral change which history has witnessed in man's physical condition.\r\n\r\nFirst let us premise with certain general laws, that intelligence,\r\nphysical well-being and freedom have a decided affinity, and are most\r\ncopiously unfolded in manufacturing countries. That as labor is\r\ndeveloped and elaborated, it becomes allied to science and art, and, in\r\na word, 'respectable.' That as these advance it becomes constantly more\r\nevident that he who strives to accomplish his labor in the most perfect\r\nmanner is continually becoming a man of science and an artist, and\r\nrising to a well deserved intellectual equality with the 'higher\r\nclasses.' That, in fine, the tendency of industry--which in this age is\r\nonly a synonym for the action of capital--is towards Republicanism.\r\n\r\nI have already remarked to the effect that so far as the welfare of man\r\nin the future is concerned, it is to be regretted that hero-worship\r\nshould still influence men so largely. When Mr. Smith runs over his\r\nscanty historical knowledge, things do not seem so bad on the whole with\r\nanybody. Mark Antony and Coriolanus and Francis the First, the plumed\r\nbarons of the feudal days, and their embroidered and belaced ladies,\r\nwith the whole merrie companie of pages, fools, troubadours and heralds,\r\nseem on the whole to have had fine times of it. 'Bloweth seed and\r\ngroweth mead'--assuredly the sun shone then as now, people wassailed or\r\nwailed--oh, 'twas pretty much the same in all ages. But when we come to\r\nthe most unmistakable _facts_, all this sheen of gilded armor and\r\negret-plumes, of gemmed goblet and altar-lace, lute, mandolin, and lay,\r\nis cloth of gold over the ghastly, shrunken limbs of a leper. Pass over\r\nthe glory of knight and dame and see how it was then with the\r\nmultitude--with the millions. Almost at the first glance, in fact, your\r\nknight and dame turn out unwashed, scantily linened, living amid scents\r\nand sounds which no modern private soldier would endure. The venison\r\npasty of high festival becomes the daily pork and mustard of home life,\r\nwith such an array of scrofula and cutaneous disorders as are horrible\r\nto think on. The household books of expenditure of the noblest families\r\nin England in the fourteenth century scarcely show as much linen used\r\nannually among a hundred people as would serve now for one mechanic.\r\nPeople of the highest rank slept naked to save night-clothes. If in\r\nFlanders or in Italy we find during their high prosperity some\r\nexceptions to this knightly and chivalric piggishness and penury, it is\r\nnone the less true that they outbalanced it by sundry and peculiar\r\nvices. And yet, bad as life then was, it is impossible for us to guess\r\nat, or realize, all its foulness. We know it mostly from poets, and the\r\npoet and historian, like the artist, have in every age lived quite out\r\nof the actual, and with all the tact of repulsion avoided common facts.\r\n\r\nBut it is with the multitude that truth and common sense and humanity\r\nhave to deal. And here, whether in Greece or in England, in Italy or in\r\nFrance, lies in the past an abyss of horror whose greatest wonder is,\r\nthat we, who are only some three centuries distant, know so little of\r\nit. There is a favorite compensative theory that man is miraculously\r\nself-adaptive to all circumstances, and that deprived of modern comforts\r\nand luxuries he would only become more vigorous and independent--that in\r\nfact he was on the whole considerably happier under a feudal baron than\r\nhe has been since. I will believe in this when I find that a man who has\r\nexchanged a stinging gout for a mere rheumatism finds himself entirely\r\nfree from pain. No, the serfs of the Middle Ages were in no sense happy.\r\nStifled moans of misery, a sense of their unutterable agonies, steal up\r\nfrom proverb and by-corners of history--we feel that they were more\r\nmiserable than jail prisoners at the present day--for then, as now, man\r\ngroaned at being an inferior, and he had much more than that to groan\r\nover in those days of strifes and dirt. And yet every one of those serfs\r\nwas God's child, as well as the baron who enslaved him. To himself he\r\nwas a world with an eternity, and of as much importance as all other\r\nmen. Through what strange heresies and insurrections, based either on\r\ninnate passion or religious conviction, do we not find Republicanism\r\nbursting out in every age, from remote Etruscan rebellions down to\r\nPeasants' wars, Anabaptist uprisings, and Jack Cade out-flamings. It was\r\nalways there, that sense of political equality and right--it always\r\ngoaded and tormented man, in the silent darkness of ignorance as in the\r\nbroad light of learning.\r\n\r\nSo long as European society consisted in a great measure of war tempered\r\nby agriculture, there could be but little progress towards a better\r\nstate of things. But the germ of industry sprouted and grew, though\r\nslowly. Merchants bought social privileges for money; even law was\r\ngrudgingly sold them, and they continued to buy. Against the old\r\nidealism, against bugbears and mythology, fairy tales and astrology,\r\ndreams, spells, charms, muttered exorcisms, commandments to obey master,\r\nship and serfdom, _de jure divino_, clouds, mists, and lies infinite;\r\nslowly rose that stupendous power of truth and of Nature which had\r\nhitherto in humanity only visited the world in broken gleams. We may\r\nassume different eras for this dividing point between immutability and\r\nprogress, between slavery and freedom. In religion, Christianity appears\r\nas first offering future happiness for the people and for all. The\r\nrevival of letters and the Reformation were glorious storms, battering\r\ndown thousands of old barriers. But in a temporal and worldly point of\r\nview the name of Bacon, perhaps, since a name is still necessary, best\r\ndistinguishes between the old and the new. From him--or his age--dates\r\nthat grappling with facts, that classifying of all knowledge so soon as\r\nobtained, that _Wissenschaft_ or _Science_ which never goes backward; in\r\nfine, that information which by its dissemination continually equalizes\r\nmen and renders rank futile. With science, labor and the laboring man\r\nbegan at once to rise. Comfort and cleanliness and health for the many\r\ntook the place of ancient deprivation and dirt--whether of body or of\r\nsoul. Humanity began to improve--for, with all the legends of the\r\nbravery of the Middle Ages, it is apparent enough that their heroes or\r\nsoldiers were not so strong or large as the men of the present day. And\r\nthrough all, amid struggles and strivings and subtle drawbacks and\r\ndeceits, worked and won its way the great power of Republicanism or of\r\nProgress, destroying, one by one, illusions, and building up in their\r\nstead fair and enduring realities.\r\n\r\nIt is but a few decades since the greater portion of all intellectual or\r\ninventive effort was devoted to setting off rank, to exalting the\r\nexalted, and, by contrast, still further degrading the lowly. What were\r\nthe glorious works of those mediæval artists in stone and canvas, in\r\norfevery and silver, in marble and bronze, nielloed salvers, golden\r\nchasing, laces as from fairy-land, canopies, garments and gems? All\r\nbeautiful patents of rank, marks to honor wealthy rank--nothing more,\r\nsave that and the imperishable proof of genius, which is ever lovely, as\r\na slave or free. But where goes the inventive talent now? Beaumarchais\r\nworked for a year to make a watch which only 'the king' could buy. Had\r\nhe lived to-day he would have striven to invent some improvement which\r\nshould be found in every man's watch. It 'pays better,' in a word, to\r\ninvent for the poor many than for the rich few--and invention has found\r\nthis out. Something which must be had in every cottage,--soap for the\r\nmillion, medicine for the masses, cheap churns, cheap clocks, always\r\nsomething of which one can sell many and much,--such are the objects\r\nwhich claim the labor of genius now. Fools grieve that Art is dead;\r\n'lives at best only in imitation;' and that we have chanced on a\r\ngodless, humdrum, steam and leather age--one of prose and dust, facts\r\nand factories. Sometimes come gasping efforts--sickly self-persuasions\r\nthat all is not so bad as it seems. Mr. Slasher of the Sunday paper is\r\nquite certain that the Creek Indian Girl statue is far superior to\r\nanything antique, while Crasher, just back from Europe, shakes his head,\r\nand assures the younger hadjis--expectant that the old masters are old\r\nhumbugs, and that it is generally understood to be so now in France--you\r\ncan get better pictures at half price any day in the shops. It will not\r\ndo. The art of small details, the art of pieces and bits, went out with\r\nthe last architecture. It went over to the people, and from them a\r\nhigher Art will yet bloom again in a beauty, a freshness, and grandeur\r\nnever before dreamed of. It will live again in Nature. For it is towards\r\nNature that progress tends--towards real beauty, and not towards the\r\nfalse 'ideal.'\r\n\r\nYet so clearly and beautifully as social progress is defined for us in\r\nhistory--so indisputably distinct as are the outlines in which it rises\r\nbefore us, there are no lack of men to believe that humanity was never\r\nso agonized as at present, never so wicked. 'Our cities are more badly\r\ngoverned than were ever cities before,'--'look at the Lobby'--everything\r\nis bad. Ah, it moves slowly, no doubt, this progress--and yet it does\r\nmove. Across rumors and lies and discouraging truths it ever\r\nmoves,--moves with the worlds through seas of light, but, unlike the\r\nworlds, goes not back again to the point of starting. And why should it\r\nnot be slow, this progress, when an Egypt could lie four thousand years\r\nin one type of civilization, when an India could believe itself millions\r\nof ages old? Slowly the locomotive gets under way. Long are the first\r\nintervals of its piston, long the wheezing sounds of its first breaths.\r\nBut puff, puff, they come, and ever a little faster. Do we not 'make\r\nhistory rapidly in these days,' since England and France have entered on\r\ntheir modern career? What place has the nineteenth century in the long\r\nlist of ages?\r\n\r\nEverywhere the action of capital, the ringing of the plane, now and\r\nthen, as in those times, the sound of arms, but all tending to far other\r\nends than the welfare of a reigning family, or to satisfy the revengeful\r\nwhim of a royal mistress, or the bigotry of a monarch. Public opinion\r\nhas its say now in all things. Even the rascality of which the\r\nconservative complains is individual rascality for private aims,\r\ntempered by public opinion, and no longer the sublimely organized\r\nrascality of all power and government. Do these things prove nothing? Do\r\nthey not show that WORK--good, hard, steady, unflinching\r\nwork--is enlarging man's destiny, and freeing itself step by step from\r\nthe primeval curse?\r\n\r\nIt is only during the present century and within the memory of man that\r\nin France and Russia the welfare of the people has become the steady\r\nobject of diplomacy, and this because any other object would now be\r\nruinous. But it is chiefly in America that the most wonderful advance\r\nhas been made, and it is here, and at the present moment, that the most\r\ntremendous struggle has arisen between the adherents of the old faith\r\nand the new. In the South, the old feudal baron under a new name, in the\r\nNorth the man of labor and of science, fight again the battle of might\r\nand right--the one strong in ignorance, the other stronger in knowledge.\r\nWho can doubt what the end thereof shall be? Amid storms and darkness,\r\nthrough death and hell-carnivals, the great truth has ever held its way\r\nonwards, slowly, for its heritage is eternal Time, but oh! how surely.\r\nAnd yet there be those who doubt the end and the issue! Doubt--oh, never\r\ndoubt! For this faith all martyrs have died, in this battle all men\r\nhave, knowingly or unknowingly, lived--they who fought against it fought\r\nfor it--for of a verity there was never yet on earth one active deed\r\ndone which tended not towards the great advance, and to bring on the\r\ngreat jubilee of Freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EDWARDS FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the surviving octogenarians of New York and its vicinity, there\r\nare few of such interesting reminiscence as one who is passing an\r\nhonored old age at his residence on Staten Island. Those who live in\r\nPort Richmond will have anticipated his name, and will perceive at once\r\nthat we refer to the Hon. Ogden Edwards. Judge Edwards is of an ancient\r\nand noble stock, being grandson of the author of the treatise on the\r\n_Freedom of the Will_. The family emigrated from England with the first\r\ncolony of the Puritans, having previously to this suffered persecution\r\nin one of its members. This man--a minister--had an only son, who became\r\nthe founder of a line illustrious for genius and piety. The latter of\r\nthese traits was illustrated in the lives of both Daniel Edwards, of\r\nHartford, and his son Timothy, who was for sixty years pastor of the\r\nchurch at Windsor, but in the person of Jonathan Edwards we see the\r\noutcropping of genius. He was the son of Timothy, and followed his\r\nfather's profession in an obscure New England village, whose meadows\r\nwere washed by the waters of the Connecticut.\r\n\r\nJonathan Edwards, during a life of close study, developed one of the\r\nclearest and most powerful intellects which was ever united to so rare a\r\ndegree of patience and humility. In that day of small things it could\r\nhardly have been dreamed that the Puritan preacher, who for a quarter of\r\na century filled the Northampton pulpit, would ever rank among the\r\ngiants of intellect. At the distance of one hundred years no name is\r\nmore powerfully felt in the theology of America than his, while in\r\nmetaphysics, and in the sphere of pure thought, his position, like that\r\nof Shakspeare in literature, is one of enviable greatness. This man is\r\nnot to be confounded with his son of the same name, who, though of\r\ndistinguished ability, was far from equaling his father; both, however,\r\nwere academic presidents, the one of Nassau Hall, at Princeton, the\r\nother of Union College; to which it may be added that Dwight, grandson\r\nof the first, was for many years the honored president of Yale. Judge\r\nEdwards is the son of Pierrepont Edwards, who was bred at Stockbridge,\r\namong the Indians. Here his father labored as missionary, having been\r\ndriven from his parish by an ill-disposed people, many of whom were, it\r\nmay be, like the Athenian of old, who was tired of hearing Aristides\r\ncalled 'the Just.'\r\n\r\nWhile laboring at Stockbridge, in the midst of poverty and privation,\r\nJonathan Edwards wrote the treatise on the Freedom of the Will, the\r\ngreatest of all existing polemics. A portion of the old parsonage\r\nremains in the village, and there are still shown marks and scratches on\r\nthe wall, made by him, as it is said, in the night, to recall by\r\ndaylight the abstruse meditations of his wakeful hours.\r\n\r\nThe children learned the Indian tongue, and when Pierrepont Edwards was\r\nestablished at New Haven, the old sachems used to visit the\r\nboy-companion of their early days, when the pipe of peace was smoked in\r\nhis kitchen in ancient form.\r\n\r\nHaving studied law with Judge Reeve of Litchfield, who married Edwards's\r\nniece, the only sister of Aaron Burr, he became highly distinguished in\r\nhis profession. It is said, indeed, that Alexander Hamilton pronounced\r\nhim the most eloquent man to whom he had ever listened. Pierrepont\r\nEdwards bore the name of his mother's family, an old English stock,\r\nwhich reckons its descent from the days of the Conqueror. The\r\nPierreponts dwelt near Newstead Abbey, the seat of Byron, and not far\r\nfrom Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood and his merry men of old.\r\nThe name of Sarah Pierrepont, wife of Jonathan Edwards, is still fresh\r\nin honored memory for wisdom and piety. She rests by her husband's side,\r\namong the tombs of the presidents of Nassau Hall, in Princeton cemetery,\r\nand is the only female name in that array of the mighty dead. It was\r\nonce suggested that these remains should be conveyed to Northampton, but\r\nthis was refused. Having banished this pair after the service of a\r\nquarter of a century, it was not meet to grant to that place the honor\r\nof their graves, and hence of the whole family but one rests at\r\nNorthampton. This is Jerusha, a lovely girl of seventeen, of whom it is\r\nrecorded by her father, in the simple terms of primitive piety, that she\r\nsaid on her death-bed that 'she had not seen one minute for several\r\nyears wherein she desired to live one minute longer for the sake of any\r\nother good in life, but doing good and living to the glory of God.' A\r\ncenotaph has been placed by her grave to the memory of her father, but\r\nit can not wipe away the error of the past, and this expression of\r\nregret only recalls a biting line from Childe Harold:\r\n\r\n  'Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar.'\r\n\r\nPierrepont Edwards was the government attorney during the Revolution,\r\nand prosecuted the confiscation of tory estates. When Benedict Arnold\r\nbecame a traitor his property was at once seized, and his homestead at\r\nNorwich, and all its contents, were confiscated. The pecuniary value of\r\nthis seizure was small, since Arnold's wasteful habits forbade any\r\nincrease of wealth, but there was his dwelling, and the little store,\r\nwith its uncouth sign, 'B. Arnold,' in which in his early day he had\r\ncarried on a petty trade. In Arnold's house were found large quantities\r\nof papers, both of a private and public character. Among the former were\r\ncertain letters to his first wife, which we have read, and from which we\r\nlearned that her life was embittered by his habits of neglect and\r\ndissipation. In one of these he alludes to a winter trip to Canada, with\r\na sleigh-load of whisky, on speculation. It is possible that this\r\njourney prompted that grand expedition in which the whisky merchant\r\nfigured as a military leader. How strange the contrast between the\r\nlonely pedlar, dealing out strong drink in the streets of Quebec, and\r\nthe victorious chieftain who, in company with Montgomery, attacked its\r\ncitadel! Some of these domestic letters contain confessions made to an\r\noutraged wife, of a character too disgusting for recital. They show a\r\nreach of depravity, which, considering those primitive times, in the\r\nland of steady habits, was indeed strange. They prove that for years\r\nArnold had been rotten at heart, and that his treason, like that of\r\nFloyd, arose from no sudden temptation, but was the end toward which his\r\nwhole life had been tending. It seemed impossible that such a man could\r\ndie without achieving infamy in some new and wondrous way. After reading\r\nthese revelations of domestic treachery, we need not be surprised at the\r\ncool perfidy exhibited at West Point. Who but a monster of treason could\r\nhave penned the papers found in André's boot? Thus, 'No. 3, a slight\r\nwood work--_very dry_--no bomb proof--a single abattis--no cannon--_the\r\nwork easily set on fire_.' 'No. 4, a wooden work about 10 feet high--no\r\nbomb proof--2 six-pounders--a slight abattis.' 'North redoubt--stone\r\nwork 4 feet high--above the stone, wood filled in with earth--_very\r\ndry_--bomb proof--no ditch--3 batteries within the fort--a poor\r\nabattis--_the work easily fired with faggots dipped in pitch_.' We quote\r\nthe above, from the André papers in the State Library, to show the\r\nculmination of a life morally base, and whose only redeeming feature,\r\n_courage_, was rather the nerve of a desperado.\r\n\r\nThe Arnold papers were for years in Judge Edwards's possession, and the\r\nmore valuable of them have been presented by him to the New York\r\nHistorical Society. As Arnold was fully aware of the character of his\r\npapers, it is possible that, connected with his bloody foray upon the\r\nshores of Connecticut, there was a desire to repossess such adverse\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nPierrepont Edwards died in 1825, having lived to see his son filling the\r\nstation of Circuit Judge upon the New York bench, where he remained\r\nuntil his sixtieth year.\r\n\r\nThose who have ever visited Judge Edwards at his seat at Port Richmond,\r\nwill not soon forget the pleasant flow of conversation which brings out\r\nthe incidents of the past. Such a man's life is a series of valuable\r\nreminiscences, weaving together the men and manners of generations both\r\npast and present. Judge Edwards commenced the practice of the law in New\r\nYork in 1800, at the early age of nineteen. His progress was marked by\r\nrapid promotion, and he was at once accorded a high rank in that galaxy\r\nwhich clustered around the bar. At that time Hamilton was in the\r\nfullness of his glory, and his opulent style was set off by the concise\r\nand pungent oratory of Burr, who was likewise in his prime. De Witt\r\nClinton was developing that breadth of intellect which afterward made\r\nhim the pride of New York, and was about to take his seat in the State\r\nSenate. It was an era remarkable for brilliance of wit and eloquence, as\r\nwell as for fierce political strife. The duel was a common method of\r\nsettling disputes among lawyers and politicians, and few men then\r\nentered the political arena who were not good shots. Looking back to\r\nthis distant point, one is astonished at the simplicity of those\r\nbeginnings which have ended in colossal greatness. The vast landed\r\nestates which now acknowledge lordly owners were then only in\r\ninception. The Lenox estate was a range of wild land, far away even from\r\nthe suburbs of the city, and owned by a plain, plodding merchant, whose\r\nson is the munificent and benevolent James Lenox, of whom New York may\r\nbe justly proud. A strong-minded German of unpolished aspect, and with\r\nsomething of a foreign accent, kept a fur store at the corner of Pearl\r\nand Pine Streets, and displayed upon his sign the name of John Jacob\r\nAstor. He was then buying up from time to time pieces of land in the\r\nvicinity of the city, and the advance of price has at length rendered\r\nhis estate the most valuable in America.\r\n\r\nTurning to literary matters, one might have found Washington Irving\r\nreading law in Wall Street, and little dreaming of the fame which\r\nawaited his advancing years. Such are among the changes which the\r\nretrospect of a long life affords. Among the events which marked Judge\r\nEdwards's advent to New York was the fearful duel between Burr and\r\nHamilton. Burr and Edwards were cousins, but the former was more than\r\ntwenty years the senior, and the blow which he received could not but be\r\nfelt by the young attorney. However, their friendship remained unbroken\r\nthrough life, and Edwards watched over the unfortunate old man during\r\nhis declining years. Burr in his better days owned an estate nearly\r\nequal to those just referred to, and one which, had he retained it,\r\nwould have rendered him immensely rich; but, although not a wasteful\r\nman, yet his schemes were of a ruinous character, and his property in\r\ndue time fell into the hands of Astor. In fact, no one could be on\r\nfriendly terms with Burr without suffering pecuniarily, since his powers\r\nof persuasion were beyond refusal. No man had ever been known in America\r\nwith such fascinating address, and such plausible schemes for carrying\r\nout some great enterprise, which, however great, must perish for the\r\nlack of endorsing a note, whose payment, of course, one would not expect\r\nhim to trouble himself with. In his latter days, when all his schemes\r\nhad exploded, and when his moral character was ruined, and men shunned\r\nhim as though he were an object of dread, Burr found a friend in his\r\ncousin, Ogden Edwards. The one had ascended in popular favor as the\r\nother had sunk, and now sat as Circuit Judge of New York. Burr was\r\nshattered by paralysis, and being nearly helpless, was removed to a\r\nhouse at Port Richmond, where he received every attention. His pension\r\nas colonel in the Continental army gave him a limited support, and his\r\nfriends clung to him to the last. Much interest was felt to ascertain\r\nhis views in respect to religion, or at least as to whether any change\r\nhad taken place since the approach of age. On this point, however, he\r\nwould not converse, and it is supposed that the infidelity of his early\r\nyears remained unchanged. He died perfectly conscious, and appeared\r\ndesirous of communicating something to a son of Judge Edwards, who\r\nattended him, but was unable to speak.\r\n\r\nBurr was buried at Princeton with military honors. His father and\r\ngrandfather lie in the row of college presidents, and his grave was made\r\njust opposite theirs, leaving only room for a path between. That spot\r\ncontained the remains of his parents and grandparents, who died in his\r\nchildhood. Seventy-eight years had passed away since they had fallen\r\nasleep, and during that interval not a member of the family had been\r\nburied there. For some years Burr's grave was without a stone. At last,\r\na plain but elegant slab of Italian marble was placed at its head. The\r\ninscription is simple, yet one can not but start when for the first time\r\nhe reads that name of thrilling memories. It has been said that the\r\nmonument was placed there by some mysterious lady, and this romantic\r\nstatement has gone the rounds of the press. This, however, is incorrect;\r\nit was the work of the Edwardses, a family which not only watched over\r\nthe last years of the unfortunate man, but thus honored his grave.[3]\r\n\r\nAmong the interesting trials which have occurred under Judge Edwards's\r\njurisdiction, we may mention the famous conspiracy case, in which Jacob\r\nBarker, Mathew L. Davis and Henry Eckford were jointly indicted for\r\nconspiracy. The object of this conspiracy was to break several of the\r\ncity banks, and the trial excited intense interest throughout the Union.\r\n\r\nThe parties were convicted, but carried the case up to the Court of\r\nError, and at last escaped. Hugh Maxwell, who was prosecuting attorney\r\nat the time, received a service of plate from the merchants of New York\r\nas an acknowledgment of his faithfulness in so important a cause.\r\nAnother case, which is still remembered for its dramatic interest and\r\nfor its thrilling details, was that of the notorious Richard P.\r\nRobinson. We doubt if any murder case has ever occurred in our country\r\nwhich brought up so many new points to embarrass the bench, or in which\r\nthat bench bore a higher responsibility.\r\n\r\nRobinson was a youth of nineteen, but recently from Connecticut, and was\r\na clerk in the reputable jobbing house of Joseph Hoxie. He was arrested\r\nearly in the morning at his boarding house in Dey Street, and aroused\r\nfrom a sound sleep, under a charge of murder. The victim was an\r\nunfortunate woman, who was found slain in her bed, in a disreputable\r\nhouse in Thomas Street, and who had obtained an escape from youthful\r\nmisery by the hand of an unknown assassin. But under what name should\r\nthat assassin be found? It was undeniable that the prisoner had been one\r\nof her intimates, but was the crime limited to himself alone? Had he\r\npartners in the deed? Was he implicated at all? Was not he wholly\r\ninnocent of the murder, and only guilty of an unfortunate acquaintance?\r\nThese were the questions which surrounded the case. It is twenty-four\r\nyears since the trial absorbed and excited the American public, and at\r\nthis distance we can not but review the matter as one of singular\r\ninterest, while the question of guilt is not yet wholly solved. In this\r\npoint it resembles the affair known as the Mary Rogers mystery, which\r\nfour years afterward thrilled New York with fresh horror.\r\n\r\nThis case attracted the genius of Edgar A. Poe, who was then elaborating\r\nthose complex tales into whose labyrinths he leads the trembling reader,\r\nuntil, when he almost feels himself lost, the clue suddenly brings him\r\nto daylight and to upper air. Poe founded upon this terrible tragedy the\r\ntale of Marié Roget, in which he effects a plausible solution of the\r\nquestion of guilt. Why did he not also solve that question, equally\r\nperplexing, as to who murdered Ellen Jewett? The deed was committed with\r\na hatchet, and as this was proved to have belonged to Hoxie's store, it\r\nwas a strong proof of Robinson's guilt; but this was rebutted by the\r\nassertion that it had been used only to open a trunk, for the purpose of\r\nrecovering a portrait and sundry gifts,--an act which by no means\r\ninvolved the further crime of murder. Whoever had committed the deed had\r\nattempted to hide it by arson, and had fired the bedding by a lighted\r\ncandle, but a timely discovery had avoided this danger.\r\n\r\nRobinson's defence was conducted by Ogden Hoffman, whose acknowledged\r\neloquence rendered him the most desirable of advocates, and he proved\r\nhimself worthy of the expectation reposed in him. Who that heard can\r\nforget his appeals in behalf of _the poor boy_, which moved the audience\r\nto tears, and shook even the equanimity of the jury? The main strength\r\nof the defence lay in charging the deed upon the keeper of the house,\r\nRosina Townsend, who was in debt to the murdered girl for such a sum as\r\nwould make her death desirable. The trial continued two weeks; the\r\ninterest increased in intensity, and the public were canvassing\r\ntestimony as fast as it was published, as though life and death to\r\nthousands hinged upon the verdict. At last, as a conclusion to all other\r\ntestimony, Hoffman produced a witness who established an alibi. At\r\ntwelve o'clock at night word was given that the jury had agreed. The\r\ncourt was opened at that late hour, the prisoner confronted with the\r\njury, and an acquittal pronounced. The prisoner flushed, turned pale,\r\nand then sunk to his seat, while Hoffman caught him to his arms, and the\r\naged father became convulsed with sobbing emotion.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the mystery enshrouding this tragedy, we have\r\nlong been satisfied as to Robinson's guilt, and we believe that it is\r\nnow admitted that the alibi was but a bold stroke of well-paid perjury.\r\n\r\nRobinson became a wanderer and died in Texas, and Rosina Townsend,\r\nhaving abandoned her infamous career, led a reformed life for some\r\nyears, and died recently, at Cattskill, in the communion of the church.\r\nHoffman, too, is no more; and, as the old court-house and Bridewell,\r\nwhich stood in the Park, have been torn down, naught remains to recall\r\nthe tragedy but the house where it occurred. Even this exhibits proof of\r\nthe changes of time, and now, expurgated of its early shame, one may\r\nfind 41 Thomas Street serving the honest purpose of a carpenter's shop.\r\n\r\nAmong the chief objects of curious interest which adorn Judge Edwards's\r\nresidence, are the family portraits. Here we may look upon the\r\nlineaments of the great metaphysician, exhibiting the calm simplicity of\r\ngreatness. A fitting companion to this is found in Sarah, his wife. As\r\none gazes upon it he can not help admiring the serene beauty of her who\r\nsoftened the stern Puritanism of her age by all the graces of life, and\r\nwhose beauty of person was set off by a still higher beauty of\r\ncharacter. In contrast with these is the fine portrait of their\r\nunfortunate grandson, and his daughter, almost as unfortunate, from the\r\npencil of Vanderleyn. The countenance of the first of these is full of\r\nlife,--the brilliant eye eloquent with power, and the whole features\r\ninstinct with that strange and fascinating beauty for which Burr was\r\nfamed. That of Theodosia has a noble bust draped after the antique, and\r\nthe superb hauteur which pervades her features would have made Cleopatra\r\nproud. Yet, under all this there is an expression of girlish loveliness\r\nand tender affection, which proved a true heart. No wonder that both\r\nBurr and Allston worshiped at the shrine of parental and conjugal love,\r\nunited as they were in such a one, or that, when she was lost at sea,\r\nthe one felt the curse scathing him with hopeless desolation, while the\r\nother went heart-broken to an early grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This age may not behold it; we may lie\r\n  Sepultured and forgotten, and the mold\r\n  Of e'er-renewing earth may first enfold\r\n  New matter to its bosom, and the sky\r\n  New nations arch beneath its canopy,\r\n  Ere this misshapen thing, the world, be rolled\r\n  And sphered to perfect freedom, ere the old\r\n  Incrusted statutes that our God defy\r\n  Be crushed in its rotation, and those die\r\n  That lived defiance through them. Then man's gold\r\n  No more shall manhood buy, or men be sold\r\n  For pottage messes.

BY JOHN HOWARD PAYNE, AUTHOR OF \"HOME, SWEET\r\nHOME\"\r\n\r\n     [The following letter was written by the late JOHN HOWARD\r\n     PAYNE to a relative in New York, in 1835. The Green-Corn Dance\r\n     which it describes was, it is believed, the last ever celebrated by\r\n     the Creeks east of the Arkansas. Soon after, they were removed to\r\n     the West, where they now are.]\r\n\r\n                                         MACON, GEORGIA, ----, 1835.\r\nMY DEAR ----.\r\n\r\n... I have been among the Indians for a few days lately. Shall I tell\r\nyou about them? You make no answer, and silence gives consent;--so I\r\nwill tell you about the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe State of Alabama, you may remember, has been famous as the abode of\r\nthe Creek Indians, always regarded as the most warlike of the southern\r\ntribes. If you will look over the map of Alabama, you will find, on the\r\nwest side of it, nearly parallel with the State of Mississippi, two\r\nrivers,--one the Coosa and the other the Talapoosa,--which, descending,\r\nunite in the Alabama. Nearly opposite to these, about one hundred miles\r\nacross, you will find another river,--the Chatahoochie, which also\r\ndescends to form, with certain tributaries, the Apalachicola. It is\r\nwithin the space bounded by these rivers, and especially at the upper\r\npart of it, that the Creeks now retain a sort of sovereignty. The United\r\nStates have in vain attempted to force the Creeks to volunteer a\r\nsurrender of their soil for compensation. A famous chief among them made\r\na treaty a few years ago to that effect; but the nation arose against\r\nhim, surrounded his house, ordered his family out, and bade him appear\r\nat the door after all but he had departed. He did so. He was shot dead,\r\nand the house burned. The treaty only took effect in part, if at all.\r\nPerpetual discontents have ensued. The United States have assumed a sort\r\nof jurisdiction over the territory, leaving the Creeks unmolested in\r\ntheir national habits and their property, with this exception in their\r\nfavor, beyond all other tribes but the Cherokees,--they have the right,\r\nif they wish to sell, to sell to individuals, at their own prices, but\r\nare not bound to treat with the republic at a settled rate,--which last\r\nmode of doing business they rather properly looked upon as giving them\r\nthe appearance of a vanquished race, and subject to the dictation of\r\nconquerors. So, what the diplomatists could not achieve was forthwith\r\nattempted by speculators;--and among those the everlasting Yankee began\r\nto appear, and the Indian independence straightway began to disappear.\r\nCertain forms were required by government to give Americans a claim to\r\nthese Creek lands. The purchaser was to bring the Indian before a\r\ngovernment agent;--in the agent's presence, the Indian was to declare\r\nwhat his possessions were, and for how much he would sell them;--the\r\nmoney was paid in presence of the agent, who gave a certificate, which,\r\nwhen countersigned by the President, authorized the purchaser to demand\r\nprotection from the national arms, if molested. All this was well\r\nenough; but it was soon discovered that the speculators would hire\r\nmiscreants and drunken Indians to personate the real possessors of\r\nlands, and, having paid them the money, would take it back as soon as\r\nthe purchase was completed, give the Indian a jug of whiskey, or a small\r\nbag of silver, for the fraud, and so become lords of the soil. Great\r\ndissatisfaction arose, and lives were lost. An anonymous letter opened\r\nthe eyes of government. The white speculators were so desperate and\r\ndangerous that any other mode of information was unsafe. Investigators\r\nwere appointed to examine into the validity of Creek sales, and the\r\nexaminers met at the time I went to witness a great Indian religious\r\nfestival, concerning which I will inform you presently; for it was by my\r\ncuriosity to view this relic of their remotest times that the visit\r\namong the Indians, alluded to in the beginning of my letter, was\r\nprompted. It has been necessary for me to be thus prolix, to make you\r\nunderstand the nature of the society--and a sort of danger too--by\r\nwhich we were surrounded. On one side, white rogues--border\r\ncutthroats--contending, through corrupted red men, for the possessions\r\nof those among them, who, though honest, are unwary. On another side,\r\nthe cheated Indian-robber of his brethren, wheedled by some fresh white\r\ncheat into a promise to sell (payable in over-charged goods) at a higher\r\nprice to the last comer, on condition of the latter individual getting\r\nthe earlier inadequate sale set aside by the agent of the United States,\r\nthrough evidence from its pretended victim that the payment for it had\r\nonly been nominal, and was forthwith fradulently withdrawn. Even the\r\njudges are accused of being, covertly, sometimes as bad as any of the\r\nrest, and it is said that instances are not unknown wherein some of them\r\nhave, not long after withdrawing from the seat of justice, proved to be\r\nfull of wealth in lands, which could only be accounted for by a supposed\r\ncollusion with accusers who have supplied them with pretexts for\r\ncancelling prior sales by Indians in favor of better offers, when\r\ncontrasted with the preceding ones, though offers really amounting to\r\nnothing at all in comparison with the true worth of the purchase. Amid\r\nthese scenes of complicated villany, it is not unusual, after the\r\nsession of a commission representing the United States for trying the\r\nvalidity of titles, to see a foiled thief rush at the successful\r\noverreaching one, with fist and bowie-knife; and it is then accounted a\r\ncase of uncommon good luck if either live to look upon what both have\r\nstolen from the red-man, and one not only from the red-man, but the\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nI beheld a fine, gentle, innocent-looking girl,--a widow, I\r\nbelieve,--come up to the investigator to assert that she had never sold\r\nher land. She had been counterfeited by some knave. The Investigator's\r\ncourt was a low bar-room. He saw me eyeing him, and some one told him I\r\nwas travelling to take notes. He did not know but government had\r\nemployed me as a secret supervisor. He seemed to shrink, and postponed a\r\ndecision. I have since heard that he is a rascal of the sort at which I\r\nhave just hinted.\r\n\r\nThe ill-starred red people here are entirely at the mercy of\r\ninterpreters, who, if not negro-slaves of their own, are half-breeds,--a\r\nworse set, generally, than the worst of either slaves or knaves. In the\r\njargon of the border, they are called _linkisters_,--some say because\r\nthey form, by interpreting, a _link_ between the Indian nations and\r\nours; but I should rather regard the word as a mere corruption of\r\n_linguist_.\r\n\r\nThe Indians become more easily deluded by the borderers than by others,\r\nbecause the borderers know that they never esteem any one to be\r\nsubstantial who does not keep a shop. So your rascal of the frontier\r\nsets up a shop, and is pronounced a _sneezer_. If his shop be large, he\r\nis a _sneezer-chubco_; if larger than any other, he is a\r\n_sneezer-chubco-mico_. But, in any of his grades, a _sneezer_ is always\r\nconsidered as a personage by no means to be sneezed at. The _sneezer_\r\nwill pay for land in goods, and thinks himself very honest if he charges\r\nhis goods at five hundred times their worth, and can make it appear by\r\nhis account against the Indian's claim that he has paid him thousands of\r\ndollars, when in fact he may scarcely have paid him hundreds of cents.\r\n\r\nWell! So much for the beautiful state of our national legislation and\r\nmorals, as civilizers and protectors of the red-men. It is time for me\r\nto relieve you from these details, so uncomplimentary to us of the\r\nsuperior order, and to tell you something about the famous religious\r\nfestival which took me amongst the Indians, and thereby caused, the\r\nforegoing first preamble,--the ennui produced by which I proceed to\r\ncure, like a quack doctor, _by doubling the dose_. Accordingly, here\r\ncomes a second preamble, by way of introductory explanation of what is\r\nto come at last.\r\n\r\nThe festival in question is called the Green-Corn Festival. All the\r\nnation assemble for its celebration at a place set apart for the\r\npurpose, as the Temple at Jerusalem was for the religious assemblages of\r\nall the Jewish tribes. It has been kept by the Creeks, and many other\r\nIndian nations,--indeed, perhaps, by the entire race,--from time\r\nimmemorial. It is prepared for, as well as fulfilled with, great form\r\nand solemnity.\r\n\r\nWhen the green corn is ripe, the Creeks seem to begin their year. Until\r\nafter the religious rites of the festival with which their New Year is\r\nushered in, it is considered as an infamy to taste the corn. On the\r\napproach of the season, there is a meeting of the chiefs of all the\r\ntowns forming any particular clan. First, an order is given out for the\r\nmanufacture of certain articles of pottery to be employed in the\r\nceremonies. A second meeting gives out a second order. New matting is to\r\nbe prepared for the seats of the assembly. There is a third meeting. A\r\nvast number of sticks are broken into parts, and then put up in\r\npackages, each containing as many sticks as there are days intervening\r\nprevious to the one appointed for the gathering of the clans. Runners\r\nare sent with these. One is flung aside every day by each receiver.\r\nPunctually, on the last day, all, with their respective families, are at\r\nthe well-known rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThat you may the more clearly understand the whole matter, I will so\r\nanticipate my story as to put you in possession of many essential\r\nparticulars concerning the place set apart by the Creeks for gathering\r\ntheir people to the festival in question. This will provide you with the\r\nunexpected gratification of even a third preamble, as an explanatory\r\navenue extra to the main subject.\r\n\r\nThe chosen spot is remote from any habitations, and consists of an ample\r\nsquare, with four large log houses, each one forming a side of the\r\nsquare, at every angle of which there is a broad opening into the area.\r\nThe houses are of logs and clay, and a sort of wicker-work, with\r\nsharp-topped, sloping roofs, like those of our log houses, but more\r\nthoroughly finished. The part of the houses fronting the square is\r\nentirely open. Their interior consists of a broad platform from end to\r\nend, raised a little more than knee-high, and so curved and inclined as\r\nto form a most comfortable place for either sitting or lying. It is\r\ncovered with the specially-prepared cane matting, which descends in\r\nfront of it to the ground. A space is left open along the entire back of\r\neach house, to afford a free circulation of air. It starts from about\r\nthe hight of my thin, so that I could peep in from the outside through\r\nthe whole of each structure, and obtain a clear view of all that was\r\ngoing on. Attached to every house towers a thick, notched mast. Behind,\r\nthe angle of one of the four broad entrances to the square, rises a\r\nhigh, cone-roofed building, circular and dark, with an entrance down an\r\ninclined plane, through a low door. Its interior was so obscured that I\r\ncould not make out what it contained; but some one said it was a\r\ncouncil-house. I occupied one corner of an outer square, next to the one\r\nI have already described, two sides of which outer square were formed by\r\nthick corn-fields, a third by a raised embankment apparently for\r\nspectators, and a fourth by the back of one of the buildings before\r\nmentioned. In the center of this outer square was a very high circular\r\nmound. This, it seems, was formed from the earth accumulated yearly by\r\nremoving the surface of the sacred square thither. At every Green-Corn\r\nFestival, the sacred square is strewn with soil yet untrodden; the soil\r\nof the year preceding being taken away, but preserved as above\r\nexplained. No stranger's foot is allowed to press the new earth of the\r\nsacred square until its consecration is complete. A gentleman told me\r\nthat he and a friend chanced once to stroll along through the edge, just\r\nafter the new soil had been laid. A friendly chief saw him and\r\nremonstrated, and seemed greatly incensed. He explained that it was\r\ndone in ignorance. The chief was pacified, but nevertheless caused every\r\nspot which had been polluted by their unhallowed steps to be uptorn, and\r\na fresh covering substituted.\r\n\r\nThe sacred square being ready, every fire in the towns under the\r\njurisdiction of the head chief is, at the same moment, extinguished.\r\nEvery house must also at that moment have been newly swept and washed.\r\nEnmities are forgotten. If a person under sentence for a crime can steal\r\nin unobserved and appear among the worshippers when their exercises\r\nbegin, his crime is no more remembered. The first ceremonial is to light\r\nthe new fire of the year. A square board is brought, with a small\r\ncircular hollow in the center. It receives the dust of a forest tree, or\r\nof dry leaves. Five chiefs take turns to whirl the stick, until the\r\nfriction produces a flame. From this sticks are lighted and conveyed to\r\nevery house throughout the tribe. The original flame is taken to the\r\ncenter of the sacred square. Wood is heaped there, and a strong fire\r\nlighted. Over this fire the holy vessels of new-made pottery are placed.\r\nDrinking-gourds, with long handles, are set around on a bench. Appointed\r\nofficers keep up an untiring surveillance over the whole, never moving\r\nfrom the spot; and here what they call the black drink is brewed, with\r\nmany forms and with intense solemnity.\r\n\r\nNow, then, having rendered you, by these numerous prefaces, much better\r\ninformed about the Creek Jerusalem and its paraphernalia than I was when\r\nI got there, I will proceed with my travel story, just as if I had not\r\nenabled you to ponder all that I saw so much more understandingly than I\r\nmyself did.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI cannot describe to you my feelings when I first found myself in the\r\nIndian country. We rode miles after miles in the native forest, seeing\r\nneither habitation nor an inhabitant to disturb the solitude and majesty\r\nof the wilderness. At length we met a native in his native land. He was\r\ngalloping on horseback. His air was oriental;--he had a turban, a robe\r\nof fringed and gaudily-figured calico, scarlet leggings, and beaded\r\nbelts and garters and pouch. We asked how far it was to the Square. He\r\nheld up a finger, and we understood him to mean one mile. Next we met\r\ntwo Indian women on horseback, laden with water-melons. In answer to our\r\nquestion of the road, they half covered a finger, to express that it was\r\nhalf a mile further, and, smiling, added,'_sneezer_--_much_,' meaning\r\nthat we should find lots of our brethren, the sneezers, there, to keep\r\nus company. We passed groups of Indian horses tied in the shade, with\r\ncords long enough to let them graze freely. We then saw the American\r\nflag--a gift from the government--floating over one of the hut-tops in\r\nthe square. We next passed numbers of visitors' horses and carriages,\r\nand servants, and under the heels of one horse a drunken vagabond\r\nIndian, or half-Indian, asleep. And, finally, we found ourselves at the\r\ncorner of the sacred square, where the aborigines were in the midst of\r\ntheir devotions.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I left the carriage, seeing an elevation just outside of one\r\nof the open corners of the sacred square, whence a clear view could be\r\nobtained of what was going on within, I took my station there. I was\r\nafterwards told that this mound was composed of ashes which had been\r\nproduced during many preceding years by such fires as were now blazing\r\nin the center; and that ashes of the sort are never permitted to be\r\nscattered, but must thus be gathered up, and carefully and religiously\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nBefore the solemnities begin,--and, some one said, though I am not sure\r\nit was on good authority, ere new earth is placed,--the women dance in\r\nthe sacred square, and entirely by themselves. I missed seeing this.\r\nThey then separate from the men, and remain apart from them until after\r\nthe fasting and other religious forms are gone through, when they have\r\nceremonies of their own, of which I shall speak in due course.\r\n\r\nAs I gazed from my stand upon the corner mound, the sacred square\r\npresented a most striking scene. Upon each of the notched masts, of\r\nwhich I have already spoken as attached to each of the structures\r\nwithin, was a stack of tall canes, hung all over with feathers, black\r\nand white. There were rude paint-daubs about the posts and roof-beams of\r\nthe open house-fronts, and here and there they were festooned with gourd\r\nvines. Chiefs were standing around, the sides and corners, alone, and\r\nopposite to each other, their eyes riveted on the earth, and motionless\r\nas statues. Every building was filled with crowds of silent\r\nIndians,--those on the back rows seated in the Turkish fashion, but\r\nthose in front with their feet to the ground. All were turbaned, all\r\nfantastically painted, all in dresses varying in ornament but alike in\r\nwildness. One chief wore a tall black hat, with a broad, massive silver\r\nband around it, and a peacock's feather; another had a silver scull-cap,\r\nwith a deep silver bullion fringe down to his eyebrows, and plates of\r\nsilver from his breast to his knee, descending his tunic. Most of them\r\nhad the eagle plume, which only those may wear who have slain a foe;\r\nnumbers sported military plumes in various positions about their\r\nturbans; and one had a tremendous tuft of black feathers declining from\r\nthe back of his head over his back; while another's head was all shaven\r\nsmooth, excepting a tuft across the center from the back to the front,\r\nlike the crest of a helmet.\r\n\r\nI never saw an assembly more absorbed with what they regarded as the\r\nsolemnities of the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe first sounds I heard were a strange low, deep wail,--a sound of many\r\nvoices drawn out in perfect unison, and only dying away with the breath\r\nitself, which indeed was longer sustained than could be done by any\r\nsinger I ever yet heard. This was followed by a second wail, in the same\r\nstyle, but shrill, like the sound of musical glasses, and giving a\r\nsimilar shiver to the nerves. And after a third wail in another key, the\r\nstatue-like figures moved and formed two diagonal lines opposite to each\r\nother, their backs to opposite angles of the square. One by one, they\r\nthen approached the huge bowls in which the black drink was boiling,\r\nand, in rotation, dipped a gourd, and took, with a most reverential\r\nexpression, a long, deep draught each. The next part of the ceremony\r\nwith them was somewhat curious; but the rapt expression of the\r\nworshippers took away the effect which such an evolution would be apt to\r\nproduce on a fastidious stomach if connected with an uninterested head.\r\nIn short, these dignitaries, without moving a muscle of the face, or a\r\njoint of the body, after a few seconds, and with great solemnity,\r\nejected what had been swallowed upon the ground. It seemed as if given\r\nforth in the spirit of a libation among the ancients. The chiefs having\r\nafterwards tasted, each replacing the gourd, and returning to his stand\r\nbefore the next came forward, they all went to their seats, and two old\r\nmen approached and handed round gourds full to the other parties present\r\nwho had remained stationary. The looks on each side were as full of\r\nsolemn awe as I have ever seen at any Christian ceremony; and certainly\r\nthe awe was more universal than usually pervades our churches.\r\n\r\nThis done, a chief made a speech, but without rising. It was listened to\r\nwith profound attention, and in one place, at a pause, called forth a\r\nvery unanimous and emphatic shout of approbation,--a long sound,\r\nseemingly of two syllables, but uttered by all in the same breath. I\r\nasked a professed _linkister_ what the speech was about; but he was\r\neither indifferent or ignorant, for he only replied that it was an\r\nappeal to them not to forsake their ancient ceremonies, but to remain\r\nfaithful in their fulfilment to the last, and that it wound up with a\r\nsort of explanatory dissertation upon the forms which were to follow.\r\n\r\nOne chief then walked round, and, in short, abrupt sentences, seemed to\r\ngive directions; whereupon some whitened, entire gourds, with long\r\nhandles, and apparently filled with pebbles, were produced; and men took\r\ntheir stations with them on mats, while those who had been seated all\r\narose, and formed in circles around the fire, led by a chief, and always\r\nbeginning their movement towards the left. The gourds were\r\nshaken;--there arose a sort of low sustained chant as the procession\r\nwent on; and it was musical enough, but every few seconds, at regular\r\nintervals, a sound was thrown in by all the dancers, in chorus, like the\r\nsharp, quick, shrill yelp of a dog. The dance seemed to bear reference\r\nto the fires in the center. Every time they came to a particular part of\r\nthe square, first the head chief turned and uplifted his hands over the\r\nflame, as if invoking a benediction, and all the people followed his\r\nexample in rotation. The dance was very unlike anything I ever saw\r\nbefore. The dancers never crossed their feet, but first gave two taps\r\neach with the heel and toe of one foot, then of the other, making a step\r\nforward as each foot was tapped on the earth; their bodies all the while\r\nstately and erect, and each, with a feather fan,--their universal and\r\nindispensable companion,--fanning himself, and keeping time with his fan\r\nas he went on. The dance was quickened, at a signal, till it became\r\nnearly a measured run, and the cries of the dancers were varied to suit\r\nthe motion, when, suddenly, all together uttered a long, shrill whoop,\r\nand stopped short, some few remaining as guards about the sacred square,\r\nbut most of the throng forthwith rushing down a steep, narrow ravine,\r\ncanopied with foliage, to the river, into which they plunged; and the\r\nstream was black on every side with their heads as they swam about,\r\nplaying all sorts of antics; the younger ones diving to fetch up pieces\r\nof silver money which the visitors flung into the water, to put their\r\ndexterity to the test.\r\n\r\nReturning to the sacred square, they went through other dances around\r\nthe fire, varying in figure and accompaniment. All were generally led by\r\nsome aged chief, who uttered a low, broken sound, to which the others\r\nresponded in chorus. Sometimes the leader, as he went around, would\r\nejaculate a feeble, tremulous exclamation, like allelu_liah_,\r\nallelu_liah_, laying the stress upon the last syllable, to which all\r\nwould respond in perfect accord, and with a deep, sonorous bass,\r\n'allelu_liah_,' and the same alternation continued to the close, which\r\nwas invariably sudden, and after a long general whoop.\r\n\r\nEach dance seemed to have a special form and significance;--one in\r\nparticular, where the dancers unstacked the tall canes with feathers\r\nsuspended from them, each taking one from the mast sustaining it; and\r\nthis one, I was told, meant to immortalize triumphs won at ball-plays.\r\nThe feathered canes are seized as markers of points gained by the\r\nbearers in the ball-play, which is the main trial of strength and skill\r\namong rival clans of the same tribe, in friendship, and even between\r\ntribe and tribe, when in harmony. The effect of these canes and\r\nfeathers, as they glanced around, with an exulting chorus, was very\r\ninspiriting, and the celebrants became almost wild with their delight as\r\nit drew near its climax, ending their closing whoop with a general laugh\r\nof triumphant recollection.\r\n\r\nOther dances were represented as alluding to conquests over bears and\r\npanthers, and even the buffalo, which last memorial is remarkable\r\nenough, having among them survived all traces of the buffalo itself.\r\nBut, excepting these vague hints, I could not find any bystander capable\r\nof giving me a further explanation of any point on which I inquired,\r\nthan that it was 'an old custom;' or, if they wished to be more\r\nexplicit, with a self-satisfied air, they would gravely remark that it\r\nwas 'the green-corn dance,'--which I knew as well as they. Could I have\r\nbeen instructed even in their phrases and speeches, I might have made\r\nvaluable conjectures. But even their language, on these occasions,\r\nseems, by their own admission, beyond the learning of the\r\n'_linkisters_.' It is a poetical, mystical idiom, varying essentially\r\nfrom that of trading and of familiar intercommunication, and utterly\r\nincomprehensible to the literal minds of mere trafficking explainers.\r\nEven were it otherwise, the persons hovering upon the frontier most\r\ningenuously own, when pressed for interpretations of Indian customs,\r\nthat they care nothing for the Indians excepting to get their lands, and\r\nthat they really consider all study concerning them as egregious folly,\r\nsave only that of finding out how much cotton their grounds will yield,\r\nand in what way the greatest speculations can be accomplished with the\r\nsmallest capital.\r\n\r\nThe last of the ceremonies of the day consisted of a sort of trial of\r\nfortitude upon the young.\r\n\r\nOld chiefs were seated at the back of the council-house, and of the four\r\nhouses of the square. They had sharp instruments,--sail-needles, awls,\r\nand flints. Children of from four to twelve, and youths, and young men,\r\npresented their limbs, and the instrument was plunged into the thighs\r\nand the calves of the legs, and drawn down in long, straight lines. As\r\nthe blood streamed, the wounded would scoop it up with bark or sticks,\r\nand dash it against the back of the building; and all the building thus\r\nbecame clotted with gore. The glory of the exercise seemed to be to\r\nsubmit without flinching, without even consciousness. The youngest\r\nchildren would sometimes show the most extraordinary self-control. All\r\noffered themselves to the experiment voluntarily. If a shudder were\r\ndetected, the old chiefs gashed deeper. But where they saw entire\r\nfirmness, an involuntary glow of admiration would flit over their stony\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nWe now left, and went to an infant town--and a savage infant it\r\nseemed--over the river to break our fast,--an indulgence which to our\r\nIndian friends is not permitted. They may neither eat nor sleep until\r\nthe ceremonies close. The town we went to is named Talassee. It has but\r\nabout a dozen houses as yet, but is delightfully situated, and I should\r\nnot wonder to see a large place there in another twelvemonth. It belongs\r\nto the region of a clan different from the one we left, though part of\r\nthe same tribe. Here the investigating agent held his court; and the\r\nplace was crowded with drunken Indians, and more uncivilized\r\nspeculators, parading about, as some had done among the spectators at\r\nthe festival, with blacked eyes and lacerated faces,--the trophies of\r\n_civil_ war for _savage_ plunder. At the house where we dined, I found\r\nthe landlady and her family implacable Indian haters. I was afterwards\r\ntold the cause. Her husband is continually marrying Indian\r\nwives,--probably to entitle himself to their lands. He, being a\r\n_sneezer_, and keeping a tavern, is a great man among them. I saw a very\r\ncomely young squaw promenading, who believed herself to be one of the\r\n_sneezer-chubco-mico's_ last wives. The man's white and original wife\r\nand daughters made an excuse to walk by, to have a look at the\r\naboriginal interloper. The latter had just received from my landlord a\r\npresent of a pair of gaudy bracelets, for which he had paid eighteen\r\ndollars at another _sneezer's_,--bracelets worth about four. I was told\r\nhow the man came by this red mate of his. He had taken a young chiefs\r\nwife in her husband's absence. The chief, returning while my landlord\r\nwas absent, got his young wife back. The landlord, on reappearing, is\r\nsaid to have threatened the chief with General Jackson and big guns. The\r\nchief said he was partial to his wife; but he had a sister much\r\nprettier, and, for the sake of peace, if nothing were said about the\r\nmatter, Mr. Landlord should have her for a wife. The bargain was struck.\r\nThe handsome little squaw I have spoken of is that same young chief's\r\nsister. This stealing of wives is beginning to excite some commotion. I\r\nheard that there had been a council of chiefs in the neighborhood of\r\nTalassee. It was a very animated one, and the wrong of wife-stealing was\r\nviolently discussed. It was thought by some almost as bad as\r\nland-stealing. Others felt rather relieved by it. One of the drunken\r\nIndians whom I saw reeling and whooping about, as I stood at the door of\r\nthe log hut where we dined, seemed of the latter party. I asked a\r\n_linkister_ the meaning of a song the Indian was singing with such glee.\r\nThe black _linkister_ laughed, and was reluctant to explain; but when I\r\npressed him, the following proved to be the meaning of the burthen:--\r\n\r\n  A man may have a wife,\r\n    And that wife an untrue one;\r\n  And yet the man won't die,\r\n    But go and get a new one.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the poor fellow had been robbed in the same way, and, between\r\nmusic and whiskey, was providing himself with consolation.\r\n\r\nI was invited to 'camp out,' as they call it, near the sacred square. A\r\nMr. Du Bois, a man with an Indian wife and family, had arrangements for\r\nthe purpose in a neighboring field; so I went to the evening dance, and\r\nleft my party to the enjoyment of a sheltering roof at the frontier Blue\r\nBeard's in Talassee; having made up my mind, after I had seen enough\r\nmore of the Indian festival for the night, to accept the proffered\r\n'field-bed' which was so conveniently nigh, and sleep, for the first\r\ntime, in a real 'sky parlor.'\r\n\r\nI sat to look at the evening dances till very late. The blazing fire\r\nthrough the darkness gave a new aspect and still more striking wildness\r\nto the fantastic scene. Some ceremonies yet unattempted seemed to be\r\ngoing on over the drinks in the deep cauldrons; and the figures around\r\nthem, with those of the dancers, reminded me of the witch scenes in\r\nMacbeth, as conceived by Shakspeare, not by the actors of them upon the\r\nstage. Four grim figures were stirring the cauldrons incessantly, with a\r\nsort of humming incantation, the others dancing around. In one of their\r\ndances they used a sort of small kettle-drum, with a guitar-like handle\r\nto it. But after a while, the evening dances seemed to vary from the\r\ndevotional to the complimentary and to the diverting; but the daylight\r\nones were altogether devotional. Apotheola led one of the less lofty\r\norder, and he is one of the most popular and respected of their chiefs.\r\nIts music seemed to consist of an exclamation from him of Yo, ho, ho!\r\nyo, ho, ho!--to which the response appeared as if complimentary, and to\r\ncontain only the animated and measured repetition of _Apotheo_LA!\r\n_Apotheo_LA! Another dance, which excited most boisterous mirth, was led\r\nby a chief who is called by the borderers Peter the Gambler. He is a\r\ngreat humorist, and famous for his love of play,--famous even among the\r\nIndians, who are all gamblers. Once throwing dice with a chief, he\r\nstaked himself against a negro slave, and won the negro. I never saw a\r\nparty more diverted than were the lookers-on at this dance. It was all\r\nmonkey capers, but all with a meaning to the Indians beyond the\r\nperception of the whites. The Indian spectators made their remarks from\r\ntheir couches as the solemn mockeries proceeded, and the object of the\r\nremarks seemed to be to provoke the dancers to laugh by making fun, and\r\nthe object of the dancers to provoke the fun-makers to laugh by\r\nperforming extravagant caricatures with imperturbable gravity.\r\n\r\nOur semi-civilized inviter got a bench for us. Some Indians, when it was\r\nnot entirely filled, tried to pull it away. Several young ones, as a\r\nfellow was trying to tug it from under us, seemed vastly amused at Du\r\nBois for saying, 'Keep your seats! keep your seats!' and mimicked him\r\nand laughed. But we were entirely unmolested in any other way, excepting\r\nfor an instant by one white rascal on the road, as I was coming, who\r\ngalloped up towards me violently, in the dark, and shouted, 'Who the\r\nhell may you be, if one were to let you alone?' Just then, however, I\r\ngot up to my party, and he said no more.\r\n\r\nI have not mentioned, I believe, that no one is allowed in the sacred\r\nsquare who tastes food during the devotional part of the ceremonies; but\r\nto get drunk on this occasion is a specially great offence. It is also\r\nconsidered as a desecration for an Indian to allow himself to be touched\r\nby even the dress of a white man, until the ceremony of purification is\r\ncomplete. There was a finely, though slightly, built Indian,--more\r\nFrench than Tartar in his look and manner,--a _linkister_, too,--the\r\nwhites called him Charley,--and Charley had got very drunk. He was, of\r\ncourse, _compelled_ to keep among the crowd outside. During the evening\r\ndance, a chief censured those who stayed from the ceremony, and those\r\nwho dishonored it by appearing in this unworthy state. Charley was by\r\nthat time very drunk indeed, but very good humored. He came nearly naked\r\nto listen. He heard the lecture; and, as he reeled around, pretending to\r\ncover his face for shame, it was amusing to see his tricks to evade\r\ntumbling against any of the bystanders, lifting his hands with an air of\r\ndandified disdain as he staggered to one side, and repeating the mock\r\ncontemptuousness when rolling towards the same peril on the other. Next\r\nmorning I heard numbers of the natives, sitting all along the outside of\r\nthe sacred square, laughing very loud, and very good-naturedly quizzing\r\npoor Charley, who had slept off somewhat of his exhilaration, but none\r\nof his good humor. Charley laughed, too, and looked foolish, and laughed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nSo, to go back and resume my story.\r\n\r\nWe went to our 'field-bed.' It consisted of a shed of loose boards on\r\ntall stakes, and under it a raised platform of loose boards upon shorter\r\nstakes. There were several human forms already wrapped in blankets and\r\nasleep upon the platform. One of our party, attempting to get among\r\nthem, was told by Milly,--Du Bois's Indian wife,--who just then awoke,\r\n'No here,--no here! dat not de rule!' It seems this was the female side\r\nof the house. My buffalo robe was spread at the opposite end. I pulled\r\noff my boots, and set them in the grass under the bed, and slept\r\ndelightfully. The only time I awoke, I saw the eyes of a towering black\r\nfigure fixed upon me. The chap was seeking a spot for a snooze among us;\r\nbut finding every inch of room occupied, gazed for a moment at a tree,\r\nflung down his blanket, and tumbled on the grass, the tall tree he had\r\nbeen eyeing, at his head, and a lesser one at his heels. The female side\r\nof my house was divided from the male side by Du Bois, who slept between\r\nthe ladies and the gentlemen. Our party consisted of nine in all, Indian\r\nladies included. In the morning, at day-break, we were up. With a joke\r\nto Milly about 'de rule,'--which she answered with a good-humored smile,\r\ncovering her face as she smiled,--we went back to the sacred square\r\namong the Indians, who had been all night awake and at their devotions.\r\n\r\nI found them preparing for the ceremonies which close the fast. Many\r\nwere standing about, and all intent on the preparations for the morning\r\nforms. They went through the taking of the black drink, repeating all\r\nthey had done the day previous. But on this occasion I more particularly\r\nobserved two circular plates of brass and steel, which appeared the\r\nremains of very antique shields. They were borne with great reverence by\r\ntwo chiefs. The natives do not pretend to explain whence they came. They\r\nkeep them apart, as something sacred. They are only produced on great\r\noccasions. I was told, too, that ears of green corn were brought in at a\r\npart of the ceremony to-day, which I missed, and that they were\r\npresented to a chief. He took them, and, after an invocation that the\r\ncorn might continue plentiful among them the year through, handed them\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThis seemed the termination of the peace-offerings, and the religious\r\npart of the affair was now to wind up with emblems of war. These were\r\nexpressed in what they call a Gun-Dance. When the dispositions were\r\nmaking for it, some persons in carriages were desired by a white\r\n_linkister_ to fall back and to remove their horses to a distance. Some\r\nladies, especially, were warned. 'Keep out of their way, ma'am,' said\r\nthe _linkister_ to a lady, 'for when they come racing about here with\r\ntheir guns, they gits powerful sarcy.' I saw them dressing for the\r\nceremony, if it may be called dressing to throw off nearly every part of\r\na scanty covering. But the Indians are especially devoted to dress, in\r\ntheir way. Some of them went aside to vary their costume with nearly\r\nevery dance.\r\n\r\nNow appeared a procession of some forty or fifty women. They entered the\r\nsquare, and took their seats together in one of the open houses. Two\r\nmen sat in front of them, holding gourds filled with pebbles. The gourds\r\nwere shaken so as to keep time, and the women began a long chant, with\r\nwhich, at regular intervals, was given a sharp, short whoop from male\r\nvoices. The women's song was said to be intended for the wail of\r\nmothers, wives, and daughters at the departure of the warriors for the\r\nfight; the response conveyed the resolution of the warriors not to be\r\nwithheld, but to fight and conquer. And now were seen two\r\nhideous-looking old warriors, with tomahawks and scalping-knives,\r\npainted most ferociously. Each went half round the circle, exchanged\r\nexclamations, kept up a sort of growl all the while, and at length\r\nstopped with a war-whoop.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, we were told to hurry to the outer square. The females\r\nand their male leaders left their places inside, and went to the mound\r\nin the centre of the outer square. The mound became entirely covered\r\nwith their forms, and the effect was very imposing. Here they resumed\r\ntheir chant. The spectators mounted on the embankment. I got on a pile\r\nof wood,--holy wood, I believe, and heaped there to keep up the sacred\r\nfires. There were numbers of Indian women in the crowd. Four stuffed\r\nfigures were placed, one in each of the four corners of the square.\r\n\r\nWe now heard firing and whooping on all sides. At length in the high\r\ncorn on one side we saw crouching savages, some with guns of every sort,\r\nsome, especially the boys, with corn-stalks to represent guns. A naked\r\nchief with a long sabre, the blade painted blood color, came before\r\nthem, flourishing his weapon and haranguing vehemently. In another\r\ncorn-field appeared another party. The two savages already mentioned as\r\nhaving given the war dance in the sacred square, now hove in sight on a\r\nthird side, cowering. One of them I understood was the person who had\r\nshot the chief I mentioned in the first part of this letter--the chief\r\nwho made an objectionable treaty, and whose house was burned. Both these\r\nwarriors crept slyly towards the outer square. One darted upon one of\r\nthe puppets, caught him from behind, and stole him off; another grasped\r\nanother puppet by the waist, flung him in the air, tumbled on him as he\r\nfell, ripped him with his knife, tore off the scalp, and broke away in\r\ntriumph. A third puppet was tomahawked, and a fourth shot. These were\r\nthe emblems of the various forms of warfare.\r\n\r\nAfter the first shot, the two parties whooped, and began to fire\r\nindiscriminately, and every shot was answered by a whoop. One shot his\r\narrow into the square, but falling short of the enemy, he covered\r\nhimself with corn and crept thither to regain the arrow, and bore it\r\nback in safety, honored with a triumphant yell as he returned. After\r\nmuch of this bush skirmishing, both parties burst into the square. There\r\nwas unremitted firing and war-whooping, the music of chanting and of the\r\npebbled gourd going all the while. At length the fighters joined in\r\nprocession, dancing a triumphal dance around the mound, plunging thence\r\nheadlong into the sacred square and all around it, and then scampering\r\naround the outside, and pouring back to the battle square; and the\r\nclosing whoop being given, the entire multitude from the battle square\r\nrushed, helter-skelter, yelping, some firing as they went, and others\r\npelting down the spectators from their high places, with the corn-stalks\r\nthat had served for guns, and which gave blows so powerful that those\r\nwho laughed at them as weapons before, rubbed their shoulders and walked\r\naway ashamed.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our conveyances homeward, and heard the splashing and\r\nshouting, as we departed, of the warriors in the water.\r\n\r\nLeave was now given to taste the corn, and all ate their fill, and, I\r\nsuppose, did not much refrain from drinking; for I heard that every\r\npathway and field around was in the morning strewed with sleeping\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nWe passed the day following in visits to the picturesque scenery of the\r\nneighborhood. We saw the fine falls of the Talapoosa, where the broken\r\nriver tumbles over wild and fantastic precipices, varying from forty to\r\neighty or a hundred feet in hight; and when wandering among the slippery\r\nrocks, we passed an old Indian with his wife and child and bow and\r\narrows. They had been shooting fishes in the stream, from a point\r\nagainst which the fishes were brought to them by the current. The\r\nscenery and the natives would have formed a fine picture. An artist of\r\nthe neighborhood made me a present of a view of these falls, which I\r\nwill show you when we meet.\r\n\r\nThe next part of the festival among the red folks--and which I\r\ndid not see, being that day on my 'tour in search of the\r\npicturesque'--consisted, I was told, in the display of wives urging out\r\ntheir husbands to hunt deer. When, from our travels among fine scenery,\r\nwe went down to the sacred square, towards night, we met Indians with\r\ndeer slung over their horses. The skin of the first that is shot is\r\npresented to a priest, who flings it back to the slayer to be retained\r\nby him as a trophy, and at the same time asks from the Great Spirit that\r\nthis may prove only the harbinger of deer in abundance whenever wanted.\r\nThere was some slight dancing that evening in the sacred square, but not\r\nof significance enough to make it an object with me to remain for it,\r\nand as so many were reserving themselves for the winding-up assembly of\r\nthe ladies, on Sunday morning, I thought I would do the same. Some of\r\nour party stayed, however, for the night. They found a miscellaneous\r\ndance at a house in the vicinity,--negroes, borderers, and reprobate\r\nIndians, all collected in one incongruous mass. A vagabond frontier man\r\nthere asked a girl to dance. She refused, and was going to dance with\r\nanother. The first drew his pistol, and swore if she would not dance\r\nwith him she should not dance at all. Twenty pistols were clicked in an\r\ninstant; but the borderer, with a horse-laugh, asked if they thought he\r\ndidn't know there was not a soul in that section of country who dared to\r\ndraw a trigger against him? He was right, for the pistols were dropped\r\nand the room cleared on the instant; whereupon the bully borderer\r\nclapped his wings and crowed and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage of the females I was rather solicitous to see, and so I\r\nwas at my post betimes. I had long to wait. I heard the gathering cry\r\nfrom the men on all sides, in the corn-fields and bushes; it was like\r\nthe neighing to each other of wild horses. After a while the ladies\r\nbegan to arrive. The spectators crowded in.\r\n\r\nThe Indian men went to their places, and among them a party to sing\r\nwhile the women danced, two of the men rattling the gourds. The\r\ncauldrons had disappeared from the centre of the sacred square.\r\n\r\nAnd now entered a long train of females, all dressed in long gowns, like\r\nour ladies, but all with gay colors, and bright shawls of various hues,\r\nand beads innumerable upon their necks, and tortoise-shell combs in\r\ntheir hair, and ears bored all around the rim, from top to bottom, and\r\nfrom every bore a massive ear-drop, very long, and generally of silver.\r\nA selected number of the dancers wore under their robes, and girded upon\r\ntheir calves, large squares of thick leather, covered all over with\r\nterrapin-shells closed together and perforated and filled with pebbles,\r\nwhich rattled like so many sleigh-bells. These they have the knack of\r\nkeeping silent until their accompaniment is required for the music of\r\nthe dance. The dresses of all the women were so long as nearly to\r\nconceal the feet, but I saw that some had neither shoes nor stockings\r\non, while others were sandalled. The shawls were principally worn like\r\nmantles. Broad ribbons, in great profusion and of every variety of hue,\r\nhung from the back of each head to the ground, and, as they moved,\r\nthese, and the innumerable sparkling beads of glass and coral and gold,\r\ngave the wearers an air of graceful and gorgeous, and, at the same time,\r\nunique wildness.\r\n\r\nThe procession entered slowly, and wound around the central fire, which\r\nstill blazed gently there, although the cauldrons had been removed; and\r\nthe train continued to stretch itself out, till it extended to three\r\ncircles and a half. The shorter side then became stationary, and stood\r\nfacing the men, who were seated in that building which contained the\r\nchanters. This last rank of dancers seemed to include the principal\r\nwearers of the terrapin leg-bands, which they continued to rattle,\r\nkeeping time with the chant, without shifting their position. At each\r\nend of their line was a leader, one an old woman and the other not\r\nyoung, both bearing a little notched stick, with two feathers floating\r\nfrom it. At a particular turn of the general figure of the dance, these\r\ntwo broke off from their fixed rank, and made a circuit outside of all\r\nthe rest, and more briskly, while the main body of the dancers, the\r\nthree circles before mentioned, which had never ceased to move, still\r\nproceeded slowly round and round, only turning at a given signal to face\r\nthe men, as the men had turned to face the emblem of the Deity, the\r\ncentral fire. Every eye among the women was planted on the ground. I\r\nnever beheld such an air of universal modesty. It seemed a part of the\r\nold men's privilege to make comments aloud, in order to surprise the\r\nwomen into a laugh. These must often have been very droll, and always\r\npersonal, I understand, and not always the most delicate. I saw a few\r\ninstances among the young girls where they were obliged to smother a\r\nsmile by putting up their handkerchiefs. But it was conquered on the\r\ninstant. The young men said nothing; but the Indian men, whether old or\r\nyoung, seemed all to take as much interest in the show as we. The chief,\r\nApotheola, had two daughters there. Both are very elegant girls, but the\r\neldest delighted me exceedingly. She seemed about seventeen or eighteen.\r\nShe is tall, a fine figure; her carriage graceful and _distingué_, and\r\nquite European. She had a white muslin gown; a black scarf, wrought all\r\nover with flowers in brilliant colors; an embroidered white\r\n_collarette_, I believe you call it; gold chains, coral beads, gold and\r\njewelled ear-rings,--single ones, not in the usual Indian\r\nsuperabundance,--her hair beautifully dressed in the Parisian style; a\r\nsplendid tortoise-shell comb, gemmed; and from one large tuft of hair\r\nupon one temple to that upon the other there passed a beautiful gold\r\nornament. Her sister's head-dress was nearly the same. The aforesaid\r\nelder Princess Apotheola, I am happy to say, looked only at me. Some one\r\nmust have told her that I meant to run away with her, for I had said so\r\nbefore I saw her to many of her friends. There was a very frolicksome,\r\nquizzical expression in her eye; and now and then it seemed to say, 'No\r\ndoubt you think all these things wonderfully droll. It diverts me to see\r\nyou so puzzled by them.' But, excepting the look at me, which only\r\nproved her excellent taste, her eye dwelt on the ground, and nothing\r\ncould have been more interestingly reserved than her whole deportment.\r\n\r\nThe dance over, all the ladies went from the square in the same order\r\nthat they entered it.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour, the same dance was repeated. When it ended, signal was\r\nmade for what they call The Dance of the Olden Time,--the breaking up of\r\nthe ceremonial, when the men and women are again allowed to intermingle.\r\n\r\nThis was done in a quick movement around and around and around again,\r\nall the men yelping wildly and merrily, as struck their fancy, and\r\ngenerally in tones intended to set the women laughing, which they did,\r\nand heartily. The sounds most resembled the yelpings of delighted dogs.\r\nFinally came the concluding whoop, and all the parties separated.\r\n\r\nBetween these two last dances, I sent for a chief, and desired him to\r\ntake charge of some slight gifts of tobacco and beads which I had\r\nbrought for them. The chief took them. I saw the others cut the tobacco,\r\nand share it. Ere long my ambassador returned, saying, 'The chiefs are\r\nmighty glad, and count it from you as very great friendship.' I had\r\nbeen too bashful about my present, and kept it back too long, through\r\nover-shyness. If I had sent it before, I might have seen the show to\r\nmore advantage. As it was, I was immediately invited to sit inside the\r\nsquare, and witness the last dance from one of the places of honor.\r\n\r\nBut I was now obliged to depart, and to give up all hopes of ever again\r\nseeing my beautiful Princess Apotheola. My only chance of a guide\r\nthrough the wilderness would have been lost had I delayed. So I\r\nreluctantly mounted my pony; and I left the Indians of Tuckabatchie and\r\ntheir Green-Corn Festival, and their beautiful Princess Apotheola.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a great gratification to me to have seen this festival; with my\r\nown eyes to have witnessed the Indians in their own nation, with my own\r\nears to have heard them in their own language. Nor was it any diminution\r\nof the interest of the spectacle to reflect that this ceremony, so\r\nprecious to them, was now probably performing in the land of their\r\nforefathers for the last, last time. I never beheld more intense\r\ndevotion; and the spirit of the forms was a right and a religious one.\r\nIt was beginning the year with fasting, with humility, with\r\npurification, with prayer, with gratitude. It was burying animosities,\r\nwhile it was strengthening courage. It was pausing to give thanks to\r\nHeaven, before daring to partake its beneficence. It was strange to see\r\nthis, too, in the midst of my own land; to travel, in the course of a\r\nregular journey in the New World, among the living evidences of one, it\r\nmay be, older than what we call the Old World;--the religion, and the\r\npeople, and the associations of the untraceable past, in the very heart\r\nof the most recent portion of the most recent people upon earth. And it\r\nwas a melancholy reflection for ourselves, that, comparing the majority\r\nof the white and red assemblage there, the barbarian should be so\r\ninfinitely the more civilized and the more interesting of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ROSIN THE BOW.\r\n\r\n  A FANTASIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In Paris, a famous city in France,\r\n    That lies by the banks of the sluggish Seine,\r\n    Where you and I may never have been,\r\n  But which we know all about in advance;--\r\n  A place of wild and wicked romance,\r\n  A place where they gamble, and fiddle and dance,\r\n  And the slowest coach has always a chance\r\n    To get put over the road, I ween,\r\n  Where women are naughty, and men are gay,\r\n  And the suicides number a dozen a day,\r\n  And one of the gallant _jeunesse dorée_\r\n  Will spend the night at prodigious play,\r\n  And in the morning go out and slay\r\n    His bosom friend with a rapier keen,\r\n  Because he loses and cannot pay,--\r\n  Lived a nice young man named DIDIER.\r\n\r\n  This nice young man had run aground,\r\n    As such young men are apt to do;\r\n  His creditors swore and his mistress frowned,\r\n    His breeches pockets held ne'er a _sou_,\r\n    His boots were getting out at the toes,\r\n    His hat was seedy, and so were his clothes,\r\n  And, as he wandered the city around,\r\n    He could not think of a single friend\r\n    Slow to dun and prompt to lend,\r\n  Whose purse he thought he could venture to sound;\r\n    In such extremities friends are few;\r\n    At least I think so, friend, don't you?\r\n\r\n  At length, on the brink of a grim despair,\r\n    He happened to think of a quaint old fellow,\r\n    A comical customer, rusty and slow,\r\n  But who used to be an elegant beau,\r\n  In dress and manner quite _comme il faut_;\r\n  And who, because he happened to know\r\n  How to play on the violoncello,\r\n  Which he'd learned for fun long time ago,\r\n  Before his finances got so low,\r\n    Had obtained a place in an orchestra choir,\r\n    And played that beautiful instrument there;\r\n  And to him monsieur determined to go;\r\n          And so,\r\n    Up to the top of a rickety stair,\r\n    To a little attic cold and bare,\r\n    He stumbled, and found the artist there.\r\n  He told his tale; how his former pride\r\n    Was crushed and humbled into the dust;\r\n  He swore he had thought of suicide,\r\n    But the charcoal venders wouldn't trust;\r\n    He had no profession or trade or art,\r\n    Money or food, and perish he must;\r\n  And then like a blacksmith's forge he sighed,\r\n    A sigh that touched the fiddler's heart.\r\n  'Cheer up, _mon cher_, and never mind;\r\n  You're the very man I was trying to find.\r\n    You know at the grand Theatre Français\r\n    The leading violoncello I play,\r\n    And my salary is two francs a day.\r\n  There's a vacant place; if you are inclined\r\n    To take the same, you'll find 'twill pay.'\r\n\r\n  DIDIER looked up in a vast amaze:\r\n    'Why, I can't do so, you very well know,\r\n  For I never fiddled in my born days.'\r\n  '_Qu'a cela ne tienne_,' his friend replied,\r\n  'Don't be too certain,--you never have tried;\r\n    You ought to give your abilities scope;\r\n  There is an anxiety most of us feel,\r\n    We may be out of time or tune,\r\n    Leave off too late, or begin too soon,\r\n    May pitch too sharp, or perhaps too flat;\r\n    So here is a cake of excellent soap,\r\n  The old, original, pure Castile,\r\n    Just rosin your bow with that.'\r\n\r\n  He took his seat in an orchestra chair,\r\n        'Twould have made you stare\r\n        Had you been there\r\n  To see his knowing and confident air,\r\n  And to hear the considerate manager say,\r\n  'There is nobody like young _Didier_;\r\n  So nice and exact, so quite _au fait_,\r\n  With a style so thoroughly _recherché_,\r\n  Some other concern may get him away,\r\n  So I think I shall have to double his pay!'\r\n\r\n  In clover the youth continues to graze,\r\n  And still in the orchestra he plays;\r\n  He's the man who never was known to make\r\n  The smallest shadow of a mistake,\r\n  And there's only one drawback on his praise,--\r\n  He is too modest by fifty per cent\r\n    For such a master of the art,\r\n  For the story went he would never consent\r\n    To play a _solo_ part.\r\n\r\n  There's a MORAL, my juvenile friend, in this,\r\n    And you need not stumble and grope;\r\n  Just look for it sharp, and you can't go amiss;\r\n    You will find, there is nothing like soap!\r\n  Don't suffer yourself to be cast down\r\n  If capricious luck should happen to frown,\r\n  Go through with the motions, and if you're acute\r\n  None will ever suspect that your fiddle is mute;\r\n  But be sure and do as the rest of us do,\r\n  And don't flourish your stick till you get your cue.\r\n  Thus, let prosperity ebb or flow,\r\n    Still bate no jot of hope,\r\n  You may draw the longest kind of a bow\r\n    If 'tis only rosined with soap!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAVEYARD AT PRINCETON.\r\n\r\n\r\nReader, have you ever visited the pleasant village of Princeton, New\r\nJersey, renowned alike in the annals of the country and of the church?\r\nWhile traveling from New York to Philadelphia by the New Jersey\r\nRailroad, you have doubtless obtained a glimpse of it, for it is 'a city\r\nset on a hill, which can not be hid,' and from the 'station,' a mile or\r\ntwo distant, its spires and belfries, gleaming from amid its thick\r\nembowering trees, present an interesting and picturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nPassing onward from the station, the first notable object that meets the\r\neye of the traveler is the Theological Seminary, a large, plain building\r\nof stone, the head-quarters in America of that branch of the Christian\r\nChurch of whose stern, unflinching orthodoxy John Knox was at once the\r\ntype and exponent. Near it stands its Library, an elegant Gothic\r\nstructure erected through the munificence of James Lenox, of New York,\r\nand containing many works of great value. The street on which these\r\nbuildings stand is appropriately named Mercer Street, for beyond them,\r\nat a short distance, lies the battle-field of Princeton, and the spot\r\nwhere the gallant Hugh Mercer fell. That spot was formerly marked by a\r\nlarge tree, but a few years ago the hallowed landmark was cut down and\r\nremoved by heartless barbarians. The house to which the wounded hero was\r\ncarried, where the 'two Quaker ladies waited on him' so assiduously,\r\nstill stands, and on the floor of the room in which he died are certain\r\nmarks, of doubtful origin, said to be blood-stains from his death-wound.\r\nOver the now peaceful battle-field, reddened with nothing more terrible\r\nthan the ruddy clover-heads, a tall flag-staff, surmounted by a gilded\r\neagle, uprears the glorious stars and stripes, and attests the loyalty\r\nof the people of Princeton.\r\n\r\nAbout midway of the long, shady street of which Princeton chiefly\r\nconsists, stands the crowning glory of the place, the venerable College\r\nof New Jersey. The college proper is a long, four-story edifice of\r\nstone, its center adorned with a tower and belfry, conspicuous from\r\nafar. At either side of it are clustered other buildings, embracing its\r\nhalls, recitation rooms, and chapel.\r\n\r\nIt stands a little distance back from the street, between it and which\r\nlies the 'Campus,' a beautiful grassy slope of vivid green, surrounded\r\nwith an iron fence, laid out with neat gravel walks, and shaded by noble\r\nand magnificent trees of more than a century's growth. Nothing can be\r\nmore beautiful in summer time than this shady lawn. Here, at all hours\r\nof the day, students may be seen reading alone, or conversing in groups,\r\nseated on the benches placed at intervals among the trees, or stretched\r\nat full length on the fragrant grass, kicking their heels gymnastically\r\nin the air, or sauntering with arms interlocked along the gravel walks,\r\nsinging, perhaps, some college song, such as\r\n\r\n  'Gaudeamus igitur,\r\n  Juvenes dum sumus,'\r\n\r\nor others less classical and more uproarious.\r\n\r\nHere, too, those known to their class-mates as the 'hard fellows,' are\r\nwont to prowl in the darkened hours, making night hideous with terrific\r\nvoices, or stealing in darkness and silence to play some trick on the\r\n'Profs.' or 'Tutes.'\r\n\r\nFrom the gates of the Campus, every afternoon at the hour of five, or\r\nafter prayers, the whole troop of students, to the number of three\r\nhundred, issue, for the purpose of taking their evening walk. Down the\r\nstreet they march, by twos and threes, chatting, laughing, telling\r\ncollege stories, or rehearsing the gossip of the day, into the extreme\r\nlower end of the long street, a locality known as Orthodox Corner, where\r\nthey turn and march back in the same order. As they proceed, their ranks\r\nare gradually swelled by a couple of hundreds of 'Seminary' students\r\n(distinguishable by their more mature appearance, their heavier beards,\r\nand their 'stove-pipe hats'), and their walk enlivened by the sight of\r\nnumerous ladies, who, by a remarkable coincidence, have also chosen the\r\nhour between five and six as the most fashionable for promenading, the\r\ndames of course usually going _up_ the street as the students are going\r\n_down_, and _down_ as, the students are going _up_, in order to afford\r\nthem opportunities to exercise their graces in bowing to those whom they\r\nknow, and staring at those whom they do not. For one brief hour, the\r\nquiet street presents the appearance of a crowded city, the pedestrians\r\njostling each other as they pass and repass; but soon as the hour of six\r\narrives, all is still again, for youths and maidens are alike engaged in\r\ndiscussing that meal for which their long walk has served as a whet.\r\n\r\nBut it was of the dead, not the living, that I was about to speak.\r\nNearly opposite the college Campus we find Witherspoon Street, named\r\nafter that brave and good man who was president of the college in the\r\ndays of the Revolution, and one of the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Following this street a short distance, we come to the\r\ncity of the dead. It is situated on an eminence, commanding a fine view\r\nof the surrounding country, embracing the village of Kingston, the\r\ndistant spires of Trenton, and the blue range of hills beyond which roll\r\nthe dark waters of the Atlantic. In natural advantages it can not\r\ncompare with some of our modern cemeteries, but the historic interest\r\nwhich attaches to it more than compensates for the lack of picturesque\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe first spot to which the visitor is directed, is the inclosure\r\ncontaining the graves of the presidents of Princeton College. They are\r\nall of the old-fashioned style of 'table tombs,' now so seldom\r\nconstructed; a flat slab, stretched on four walls of solid masonry,\r\ncovering the whole grave. It was on such a tombstone that, in the old\r\nGreyfriars churchyard in Edinburgh, the solemn League and Covenant, from\r\nwhich resulted events so important to Scotland, was signed. No 'storied\r\nurn or animated bust' records the virtues of these venerable men,--not\r\neven marble in its simplest form has been used to mark their\r\nresting-place. The slabs are of coarse, grey stone, with long\r\ninscriptions in Latin occupying their entire surface. Many of them,\r\nespecially that of the pious and renowned JONATHAN EDWARDS, who\r\nleft his New England home only to find a grave in New Jersey, having\r\ndied a month after his removal to Princeton, have been most shamefully\r\nmutilated by relic-hunters and curiosity-mongers; innumerable pieces\r\nhaving been chipped off the edges of the slabs, until even the\r\ninscriptions have been encroached upon. To prevent, if possible, further\r\nmutilation, the following unique and elaborate, but eloquent notice,\r\nenclosed in an iron frame, has been placed over the graves of these\r\nreverend fathers. It was written by Professor, now Dr. Giger, of the\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\n     Keep your sacrilegious hands off these venerable stones! Parian\r\n     marble, wrought with consummate skill, could not replace them.\r\n     Connected with these homely monuments are historical associations\r\n     that ought not to be forgotten. The scarcity of better materials,\r\n     the rudeness of monumental sculpture, the poverty of the country,\r\n     the early struggles and pecuniary embarrassments of the colony, at\r\n     the period when these monuments were erected, as well as the\r\n     self-denial and hardships and labors of the distinguished men who\r\n     gave fame and usefulness to Nassau Hall, are indicated by these\r\n     rough stones. Nothing modern, nothing polished or magnificent,\r\n     could suggest the early history of New Jersey. Spare what remains\r\n     of these broken memorials. Thoughtless young man! why do you break\r\n     and deface these old monuments? A few fragments carried in your\r\n     pocket, or placed in your cabinet, will not impart to you the\r\n     activity and energy of Burr, or the profound and logical intellect\r\n     of Edwards, or the eloquence of Davies, or the piety and triumphant\r\n     death of Finley, or the poetical wisdom, the power of governing and\r\n     inspiring youth, the love of knowledge, and the stern, unflinching\r\n     patriotism of Witherspoon. If you admire and reverence the\r\n     character of these great and good men, read their works imitate\r\n     their example; and forbear, we beseech you, to add to the shameful\r\n     mutilation of the frail memorials intended to protect their bones\r\n     from insult.\r\n\r\nBut there is a strange and startling incongruity observable in this\r\nenclosure. At the foot of the grave where rest the remains of the\r\nvenerable Aaron Burr, first president of the College of New Jersey,\r\nstands a tall white marble monument of modern form and appearance, so\r\nutterly out of keeping with the rest of the tombs, that the visitor at\r\nonce turns to it, and is none the less startled to find that it marks\r\nthe last resting-place of that other Aaron Burr, the traitor, the\r\nduellist, the libertine, whose remains, brought hither in the night,\r\nwere surreptitiously buried at the feet of his venerated father, and\r\nthis monument placed over them, years afterwards, in the same manner.\r\nAnd for his father's sake, there they were suffered to remain. 'After\r\nlife's fitful fever he sleeps well,' in the midst of these old grey\r\nstones, and surrounded by the honored dead. The monument bears no\r\nrecord, except his name, the dates of his birth and death, and the\r\nstatement that he was Vice-President of the United States from 1801 to\r\n1805. It is as if it said,--\r\n\r\n  'No further seek his merits to disclose,\r\n  Or draw his frailties from their dread abode.'\r\n\r\nNot a quarter of a mile from where his dust thus reposes, there sleeps,\r\nin a neglected grave in a small grove of trees behind the college, one\r\nof his hapless victims, a young lady of Philadelphia, who died, as the\r\nmouldering headstone, half sunken in the turf, informs us, 'at the early\r\nage of twenty-two.'\r\n\r\nThe next point of interest is the spot where seven or eight elegant\r\nshafts of white marble, erected by their class-mates, mark the graves of\r\nstudents who have died during their collegiate course. They are all\r\nremarkable for the beauty and chaste simplicity of their design, and the\r\nappropriateness of their inscriptions. No historic interest attaches to\r\nthem; no well-earned fame gilds them with a halo of glory; but a feeling\r\ntouching and sad creeps over the heart as we read on the tomb the name\r\nof each sleeper's distant home, and think of the poor young man dying in\r\nthe midst of strangers, while doubtless\r\n\r\n  'There was weeping far away,\r\n    And gentle eyes, for him,\r\n  With watching many an anxious day,\r\n    Were sorrowful and dim.'\r\n\r\nPassing on, we reach the graves of the three Alexanders, father and two\r\nsons, whose writings are dear to so many Christian hearts. Side by side\r\nthey repose, under three slabs of pure white marble, inscribed with\r\nappropriate epitaphs. That of the father, Archibald Alexander, for fifty\r\nyears professor in the Theological Seminary, is a simple, unadorned\r\nrecord of his personal history; that of the younger brother, Joseph\r\nAddison, who was a man of immense learning, able to read, write, and\r\nconverse in sixteen languages, tells us that 'his great talents and vast\r\nlearning were entirely devoted to the exposition and elucidation of the\r\nWord of God;' but to New Yorkers that of the elder brother, Dr. James W.\r\nAlexander, is fraught with the greatest interest, from his having so\r\nlately occupied a prominent place among the first divines and scholars\r\nof our country. It runs thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n         SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF\r\n\r\n         JAMES WADDEL ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n     A man of God, thoroughly furnished unto all good works; a learned,\r\n     elegant, and accomplished scholar; a faithful, affectionate, and\r\n     beloved pastor; an able, eloquent, and successful preacher;\r\n     professor of mathematics in the College of New Jersey; professor of\r\n     ecclesiastical history in Princeton Theological Seminary; pastor of\r\n     the Presbyterian Church, corner of Fifth Avenue and Nineteenth\r\n     Street, New York.\r\n\r\n     Throughout his life and labors, he illustrated those gifts and\r\n     graces that exalt humanity and adorn the church of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nScattered about the graveyard are many monuments, attractive and\r\ninteresting from their artistic beauty alone. One of the most chaste and\r\nelegant designs I have ever seen is the tomb erected by a gentleman of\r\nPhiladelphia, to the memory of his wife, son, and daughter, who perished\r\nin the burning of the 'Henry Clay' on the Hudson River. It is in the\r\nform of a casket, of white marble, beautifully carved and of graceful\r\nform, elevated on a pedestal of polished stone, of a blueish tint. On\r\none end of the casket are inscribed the words\r\n\r\n       WIFE\r\n     DAUGHTER\r\n       SON\r\n\r\non the other end,\r\n\r\n      MOTHER\r\n      SISTER\r\n      BROTHER\r\n\r\nwhile one side bears the appropriate text of Scripture:--\r\n\r\n     When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and\r\n     through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee;\r\n\r\nand the other the comforting words:--\r\n\r\n     For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also\r\n     which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.\r\n\r\nUnder a drooping cypress tree, half hidden amid its dark green foliage,\r\nis a monument of white marble, in the form of a Greek cross, low but\r\nmassive, on which there is no epitaph or inscription whatever; but on\r\nthe little foot-stone beyond it are the simple words:--\r\n\r\n     GENEVIEVE.\r\n     Died 1851,\r\n     Aged 18.\r\n\r\nNumerous 'broken rosebuds' mark the graves of children, and the device\r\nis so often repeated as to become tiresome; but on one handsome monument\r\nis carved a wreath of flowers, from which a rose has apparently dropped,\r\nand fallen on the pedestal,--a beautiful illustration of the loss the\r\nfamily circle had sustained in the death of her who rests below. Another\r\nchild-grave, the tombstone a small upright slab surmounted by a wreath\r\nof flowers, bears the touching inscription:--\r\n\r\n      Our only Son,\r\n      JOHN AGUR E----.\r\n      Aged 2 years.\r\n\r\nMany graves here, as elsewhere, are adorned with examples of 'graveyard\r\npoetry;' but most of it is of that humble character which is illustrated\r\nby the following:--\r\n\r\n  'Farewell, beloved wife: I must go\r\n  And leave you in this world of woe.\r\n  A few short years, then we shall meet\r\n  Together at our Saviour's feet.'\r\n\r\nOne more epitaph, before we leave this interesting and time-honored\r\nplace of graves. It is from a plain horizontal slab, not far from the\r\nentrance; and is, to our thinking, one of the most beautiful and\r\ntouching monumental inscriptions ever penned.\r\n\r\n     SARAH B----,\r\n     Wife of the Rev. C---- K----.\r\n\r\n     A humble worshiper of Christ, she lived in love and died in faith.\r\n     Truthful woman, delightful companion, ardent friend, devoted wife,\r\n     self-sacrificing mother, we lay you gently here, our best beloved,\r\n     to gather strength and beauty for the coming of the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG THE PINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome winters ago I passed several weeks at Tallahassee, Florida, and\r\nwhile there made the acquaintance of Colonel J----, a South Carolina\r\nplanter. Accident, some little time later, threw us together again at\r\nCharleston, when I was gratified to learn that he would be my _compagnon\r\ndu voyâge_ as far north as New York.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied by his body-servant, 'Jim,' a fine specimen of the\r\ngenus darky, about thirty years of age, born and reared in his master's\r\nfamily. As far as possible we made the journey by day, stopping at some\r\nconvenient resting-place by night; on which occasions the Colonel, Jim,\r\nand myself would occupy the same or adjoining apartments, 'we white\r\nfolks' sleeping on four posts, while the more democratic negro spread\r\nhis blanket on the floor. Thrown together thus intimately, it was but\r\nnatural that we should learn much of each other.\r\n\r\nThe 'Colonel' was a highly cultivated and intelligent gentleman, and\r\nduring this journey a friendship sprung up between us,--afterward kept\r\nalive by a regular correspondence,--which led him, with his wife and\r\ndaughter, and the man Jim, to my house on his next visit at the North,\r\none year later. I then promised,--if I should ever again travel in South\r\nCarolina,--to visit him on his plantation in the extreme north-eastern\r\npart of the State.\r\n\r\nIn December last, a short time prior to the passage of the ordinance of\r\nsecession, I had occasion to again visit Charleston, and, previous to\r\nsetting out, dispatched a letter to the Colonel with the information\r\nthat I was then ready to be led of him 'into the wilderness.' On\r\narriving at the head-quarters of Secession, I found a missive awaiting\r\nme, in which he cordially renewed his previous tender of hospitality,\r\ngave me particular directions how to proceed, and stated that his 'man\r\nJim' would meet me with a carriage at Georgetown, and convey me thence,\r\nseventy miles, to 'the plantation.'\r\n\r\nHaving performed the business which led me to Charleston, I set out for\r\nthe rendezvous five days before the date fixed for the meeting,\r\nintending to occupy the intervening time in an exploration of the\r\nancient town and its surroundings. Having passed the half of one day and\r\nthe whole of one night in that delectable place,--during which night I\r\nwas set on and nearly annihilated, while lying defenceless in my bed, by\r\na myriad of Carolina _big-bugs_,--I found it so intolerably dull that,\r\nto escape a siege of 'the blues,' I hired a horse and a negro driver at\r\na livery-stable, and started off for the plantation.\r\n\r\nI make this preliminary statement to give the reader a satisfactory\r\nreason for taking him over wretched roads, at so inclement a season,\r\nwith no companion but an ebony Jehu, into the very heart of\r\nSecessiondom.\r\n\r\nMy companion was a very intelligent native African, of the name of\r\nScipio, who 'hired his time' of his mistress, and obtained his living by\r\ndoing odd jobs around the streets and wharves of Georgetown. Portions of\r\nthe country through which we passed were almost as wild as the forests\r\nof Oregon, and in some places the feeling against the North and Northern\r\ntravelers ran very high. I had some strange encounters with swollen\r\nstreams and roaring secessionists, in which my negro driver was of great\r\nservice to me; and the knowledge I thus gained of him led me for the\r\nfirst time to the opinion, that real elevation and nobility of character\r\nmay exist under an ebony skin.\r\n\r\nOur first day on the road was clear, sunshiny, and of delicious\r\ntemperature--one of those days so peculiar to the Southern winter, when\r\nthe blood bounds through every vein as if thrilled by electricity, and a\r\nman of lively temperament can scarcely restrain his legs from dancing a\r\nbreakdown. Night found us thirty miles on our way, and under the roof of\r\na hospitable planter. A storm came on with the going down of the sun,\r\nand lasted during the following day; but, desiring to arrive at my\r\ndestination before the servant should set out to meet me, I decided to\r\npush on in the rain.\r\n\r\nOur second day's travel was attended with sundry interruptions and\r\nadventures, and night overtook us in the midst of a forest, uncertain\r\nwhere we were, and half dead from exposure to the storm; but after\r\nseveral hours of hard riding, we found ourselves, drenched to the skin\r\nand benumbed with the cold, before the door of a one-story log cabin,\r\ntenanted by a family of\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR WHITES.\r\n\r\nThe rain was falling in torrents, and the night was as 'dark as the\r\ndarkest corner of the dark place below.' We were in the midst of what\r\nseemed an endless forest of turpentine pines, and had seen no human\r\nhabitation for hours. Not knowing where the road might lead us, and\r\nfeeling totally unable to proceed, we determined to ask shelter at the\r\nshanty for the night.\r\n\r\nIn answer to our summons a wretched-looking, half-clad, dirt-bedraggled\r\nwoman thrust her head from the door-way, with the inquiry, 'Who are ye?'\r\n\r\n'We'm only massa and me, and de hoss, and we'm half dead wid de cold,'\r\nsaid Scipio; 'can't we cum in out ob de rain?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, strangers,' replied the woman, eying us as closely as the darkness\r\nwould permit, 'you'll find mighty poor fixins har, but I reckon ye can\r\ncome in.'\r\n\r\nEntering the house, we saw, by the light of a blazing pile of pine\r\nknots, which roared and crackled on the hearth, that it contained only a\r\nsingle apartment, about twenty feet square. In front of the fire-place,\r\nwhich occupied the better half of one side of the room, the floor was of\r\nthe bare earth, littered over with pine chips, dead cinders, live coals,\r\nbroken pots, and a lazy spaniel dog. Opposite to this, at the other end\r\nof the room, were two low beds, which looked as if they had been 'slept\r\nin forever, and never made up.' Against the wall, between the beds and\r\nthe fire-place, stood a small pine table, and on it was a large wooden\r\nbowl, from whose mouth protruded the handles of several unwashed pewter\r\nspoons. On the right of the fire was a razeed rocking-chair, evidently\r\nthe peculiar property of the mistress of the mansion, and three blocks\r\nof pine log, sawn off smoothly, and made to serve for seats. Over\r\nagainst these towered a high-backed settle, something like that on which\r\n\r\n            'sot Huldy all alone,\r\n  When Zeke peeked thru the winder;'\r\n\r\nand on it, her head resting partly on her arm, partly on the end of the\r\nsettle, one small, bare foot pressing the ground, the other, with the\r\npart of the person which is supposed to require stockings, extended in a\r\nhorizontal direction,--reclined, not Huldy, but her Southern cousin,\r\nwho, I will wager, was decidedly the prettier and dirtier of the two.\r\nOur entrance did not seem to disconcert her in the least, for she lay\r\nthere as unmoved as a marble statue, her large black eyes riveted on my\r\nface as if seeing some nondescript animal for the first time. I stood\r\nfor a moment transfixed with admiration. In a somewhat extensive\r\nobservation of her sex, in both hemispheres, I had never witnessed such\r\na form, such eyes, such faultless features, and such wavy, black,\r\nluxuriant hair. A glance at her dress,--a soiled, greasy, grayish\r\nlinsey-woolsey gown, apparently her only garment,--and a second look at\r\nher face, which, on closer inspection, had precisely the hue of a tallow\r\ncandle, recalled me to myself, and allowed me to complete the survey of\r\nthe premises.\r\n\r\nThe house was built of unhewn logs, separated by wide interstices,\r\nthrough which the cold air came, in decidedly fresh if not health-giving\r\ncurrents, while a large rent in the roof, that let in the rain, gave the\r\ninmates an excellent opportunity for indulging in a shower-bath, of\r\nwhich they seemed greatly in need. The chimney, which had intruded a\r\ncouple of feet into the room, as if to keep out of the cold, and\r\nthreatened momentarily to tumble down, was of sticks, built up in clay,\r\nwhile the windows were of thick, unplaned boards.\r\n\r\nTwo pretty girls, one of perhaps ten and the other of fourteen years,\r\nevidently sisters of the unadorned beauty, the middle-aged woman\r\nwho had admitted us, and the dog,--the only male member of the\r\nhousehold,--composed the family. I had seen negro cabins, but these\r\npeople were whites, and these whites were _South Carolinians_. Who will\r\nsay that the days of chivalry are over, when such counterparts of the\r\nfeudal serfs still exist?\r\n\r\nAfter I had seated myself by the fire, and the driver had gone out to\r\nstow the horse away under the tumble-down shed at the back of the house,\r\nthe elder woman said to me,--\r\n\r\n'Reckon yer wet. Ben in the rain?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, madam, we've been out most of the day, and got in the river below\r\nhere.'\r\n\r\n'Did ye? Ye mean the \"run.\" I reckon it's right deep now.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, the horse had to swim for it,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Ye orter strip and put on dry cloes to onst.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, madam, I will.'\r\n\r\nGoing to my portmanteau, which the darky had placed near the door, I\r\nfound it dripping with wet, and opening it, discovered that every\r\narticle in it had undergone the rite of total immersion.\r\n\r\n'Everything is thoroughly soaked, madam. I shall have to dry myself by\r\nyour fire. Can you get me a cup of tea?'\r\n\r\n'Right sorry, stranger, but I can't. Hain't a morsel to eat or drink in\r\nthe house.'\r\n\r\nRemembering that our excellent hostess of the night before had insisted\r\non filling our wagon-box with a quantity of 'chicken fixins,' to serve\r\nus in an emergency, and that my brandy flask was in my India-rubber\r\ncoat, I sent Scipio out for them.\r\n\r\nOur stores disclosed boiled chicken, bacon, sandwiches, sweet potatoes,\r\nshort cake, corn bread, buttered waffles, and 'common doin's' too\r\nnumerous to mention, enough to last a family of one for a fortnight, but\r\nall completely saturated with water. Wet or dry, however, the provisions\r\nwere a godsend to the half-starved family, and their hearts seemed to\r\nopen to me with amazing rapidity. The dog got up and wagged his tail,\r\nand even the marble-like beauty arose from her reclining posture and\r\ninvited me to a seat with her on the bench.\r\n\r\nThe kettle was soon steaming over the fire, and the boiling water, mixed\r\nwith a little brandy, served as a capital substitute for tea. After the\r\nchicken was re-cooked, and the other edibles 'warmed up,' the little\r\npine table was brought out, and I learned--what I had before\r\nsuspected--that the big wooden bowl and the half dozen pewter spoons\r\nwere the only 'crockery' the family possessed.\r\n\r\nI declined the proffered seat at the table, the cooking utensils being\r\nanything but inviting, and contented myself with the brandy and water;\r\nbut, forgetting for a moment his color, I motioned to the darky--who was\r\nas wet and jaded, and much more hungry than I was--to take the place\r\noffered to me. The negro did not seem inclined to do so, but the woman,\r\nobserving my gesture, yelled out, her eyes flashing with anger,--\r\n\r\n'No, sar! No darkies eats with us. Hope ye don't reckon _yerself_ no\r\nbetter than a good-for-nothin, no-account nigger!'\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon, madam; I intended no offense. Scipio has served me\r\nvery faithfully for two days, and is very tired and hungry. I forgot\r\nmyself.'\r\n\r\nThis mollified the lady, and she replied,--\r\n\r\n'Niggers is good enuff in thar place, but warn't meant to 'sociate with\r\nwhite folks.'\r\n\r\nThere may have been some ground for a distinction in that case; there\r\ncertainly was a difference between the specimens of the two races then\r\nbefore me; but, not being one of the chivalry, it struck me that the\r\nodds were on the side of the black man. The whites were shiftless,\r\nragged, and starving; the black well clad, cleanly, energetic, and as\r\nmuch above the others in intellect as Jupiter is above a church steeple.\r\nTo be sure, color was against him, and he was, after all, a servant in\r\nthe land of chivalry and of servant-owners. Of course the woman was\r\nright, after all.\r\n\r\nShe soon resumed the conversation, with this remark:--\r\n\r\n'Reckon yer a stranger in these parts; whar d'ye come from?'\r\n\r\n'From New York, madam.'\r\n\r\n'New York! whar's that?'\r\n\r\n'It's a city at the North.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! yas; I've heern tell on it; that's whar the Cunnel sells his\r\nturpentine. Quite a place, ain't it?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, quite a place. Something larger than all South Carolina.'\r\n\r\n'What d'ye say? Larger nor South Carolina! Kinder reckon tain't, is't?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, madam, it is.'\r\n\r\n'Du tell! Tain't so large as Charles'n, is't?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, twenty times larger than Charleston.'\r\n\r\n'Lord o'massy! How does all the folks live thar?'\r\n\r\n'Live quite as well as they do here.'\r\n\r\n'Ye don't have no niggers thar, does ye?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but none that are slaves.'\r\n\r\n'Have Ablisherners thar, don't ye? Them people that go agin the South?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, some of them.'\r\n\r\n'What do they go agin the South for?'\r\n\r\n'They go for freeing the slaves. Some of them think a black man as good\r\nas a white one.'\r\n\r\n'Quar, that; yer an Ablisherner, ain't ye?'\r\n\r\n'No, I'm an old-fashioned Whig.'\r\n\r\n'What's that? Never heerd on them afore.'\r\n\r\n'An old-fashioned Whig, madam, is a man whose political principles are\r\nperfect, and who is as perfect as his principles.'\r\n\r\nThat was a 'stumper' for the poor woman, who evidently did not\r\nunderstand one half of the sentence.\r\n\r\n'Right sort of folks, them,' she said, in a half inquiring tone.\r\n\r\n'Yes, but they're all dead now.'\r\n\r\n'Dead?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dead, beyond the hope of resurrection.'\r\n\r\n'I've heern all the dead war to be resurrected. Didn't ye say ye war one\r\non 'em? _Ye_ ain't dead yet,' said the woman, chuckling at having\r\ncornered me.\r\n\r\n'But I'm more than _half_ dead just now.'\r\n\r\n'Ah,' replied the woman, still laughing, 'yer a chicken.'\r\n\r\n'A chicken! what's that?'\r\n\r\n'A thing that goes on tu legs, and karkles,' was the ready reply.\r\n\r\n'Ah, my dear madam, you can out-talk me.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I reckon I kin outrun ye, tu. Ye ain't over rugged.' Then, after a\r\npause, she added,--'What d'ye 'lect that darky Linkum for President\r\nfor?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't elect him. _I_ voted for Douglass. But Lincoln is not a\r\ndarky.'\r\n\r\n'He's a mullater, then; I've heern he war,' she replied.\r\n\r\n'No, he's not a mulatto; he's a rail-splitter.'\r\n\r\n'Rail-splitter? _Then he's a nigger, shore_.'\r\n\r\n'No, madam; white men at the North split rails.'\r\n\r\n'An' white wimmin tu, p'raps,' said the woman, with a contemptuous toss\r\nof the head.\r\n\r\n'No, they don't,' I replied,' but white women _work_ there.'\r\n\r\n'White wimmin work thar!' chimed in the hitherto speechless beauty,\r\nshowing a set of teeth of the exact color of her skin,--_yaller_. 'What\r\ndu the' du?'\r\n\r\n'Some of them attend in stores, some set type, some teach school, and\r\nsome work in factories.'\r\n\r\n'Du tell! Dress nice, and make money?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I replied, 'they make money, and dress like fine ladies; in fact,\r\n_are_ fine ladies. I know one young woman, of about your age, that had\r\nto get her own education, who earns a thousand dollars a year by\r\nteaching, and I've heard of many factory-girls who support their\r\nparents, and lay up a great deal of money, by working in the mills.'\r\n\r\n'Wal!' replied the young woman, with a contemptuous curl of her\r\nmatchless upper lip; 'schule-marms ain't fine ladies; fine ladies don't\r\nwork; only niggers does that _har_. I reckon I'd ruther be 'spectable\r\nthan work for a livin'.'\r\n\r\nI could but think how magnificently the lips of some of our glorious\r\nYankee girls would have curled had they heard that remark, and seen the\r\npoor girl that made it, with her torn, worn, greasy dress; her bare,\r\ndirty legs and feet, and her arms, neck, and face so thickly encrusted\r\nwith a layer of clayey mud that there was danger of hydrophobia if she\r\nwent near a wash-tub. Restraining my involuntary disgust, I replied,--\r\n\r\n'We at the North think work is respectable. We do not look down on a\r\nman or a woman for earning their daily bread. We all work.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, and that's the why ye'r all sech cowards,' said the old woman.\r\n\r\n'Cowards!' I said; 'who tells you that?'\r\n\r\n'My old man; he says one on our _boys_ can lick five of your Yankee\r\n_men_.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps so. Is your husband away from home?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, him and our Cal. ar down to Charles'n.'\r\n\r\n'Cal. is your son, is he?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he's my oldest, and a likely lad he ar tu--He's twenty-one, and\r\nhis name ar JOHN CALHOUN MILLS. He's gone a troopin' it with\r\nhis fader.'\r\n\r\n'What, both gone and left you ladies here alone?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, the Cunnel sed every man orter go, and they warn't to be ahind the\r\nrest. The Cunnel--Cunnel J.--looks arter us while they is away.'\r\n\r\n'But I should think the Colonel looked after you poorly--giving you\r\nnothing to eat.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! it's ben sech a storm to-day, the gals couldn't go for the vittles,\r\nthough tain't a great way. We'r on his plantation; this house is his'n.'\r\n\r\nThis last was agreeable news, and it occurred to me that if we were so\r\nnear the Colonel's we might push on, and get there that night, in spite\r\nof the storm; so I said,--\r\n\r\n'Indeed; I'm going to the Colonel's. How far is his house from here?'\r\n\r\n'A right smart six mile; it's at the Cross-roads. Ye know the Cunnel, du\r\nye?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, I know him well. If his house is not more than six miles off,\r\nI think we had better go on to-night. What do you say, Scip?'\r\n\r\n'I reckon we'd better gwo, massa,' replied the darky, who had spread my\r\ntraveling-shawl in the chimney-corner, and was seated on it, drying his\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n'Ye'd better not,' said the woman; 'ye better stay har; thar's a right\r\nsmart run twixt har and the Cunnel's, and tain't safe to cross arter\r\ndark.'\r\n\r\n'If that is so we'd better stay, Scip; don't you think so?' I said to\r\nthe darky.\r\n\r\n'Jess as you like, massa. We got tru wid de oder one, and I reckon\r\ntain't no woss nor dat.'\r\n\r\n'The bridge ar carried away, and ye'll have to swim _shore_,' said the\r\nwoman. 'Ye'd better stay.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, madam, I think we will,' I replied, after a moment's\r\nthought; 'our horse has swum one of your creeks to-night, and I dare not\r\ntry another.'\r\n\r\nI had taken off my coat, and had been standing, during the greater part\r\nof this conversation, in my shirt-sleeves before the fire, turning round\r\noccasionally to facilitate the drying process, and taking every now and\r\nthen a sip from the gourd containing our brandy and water; aided in the\r\nlatter exercise by the old woman and the eldest girl, who indulged quite\r\nas freely as I did.\r\n\r\n'Mighty good brandy that,' at last said the woman. 'Ye like brandy,\r\ndon't ye?'\r\n\r\n'Not very much, madam. I take it to-night because I've been exposed to\r\nthe storm, and it stimulates the circulation. But Scip, here, don't like\r\nspirits. He'll get the rheumatism because he don't.'\r\n\r\n'Don't like dem sort of sperits, massa; but rumatics neber trubble me.'\r\n\r\n'But I've got it mighty bad,' said the woman, '_and I take 'em whenever\r\nI kin get 'em_.'\r\n\r\nI rather thought she did, but I 'reckoned' her principal beverage was\r\nwhisky.\r\n\r\n'You have the rheumatism, madam, because your house is so open; a\r\ndraught of air is always unhealthy.'\r\n\r\n'I allers reckoned 'twar _healthy_,' she replied. 'Ye Yankee folks have\r\nquar notions.'\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch, and found it was nearly ten o'clock, and, feeling\r\nvery tired, said to the hostess,--\r\n\r\n'Where do you mean we shall sleep?'\r\n\r\n'Ye can take that ar bed,' pointing to the one nearest the wall, 'the\r\ndarky can sleep har;' motioning to the settle on which she was seated.\r\n\r\n'But where will you and your daughters sleep? I don't wish to turn you\r\nout of your beds.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! don't ye keer for us; we kin all bunk together; dun it afore. Like\r\nto turn in now?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, thank you, I would;' and without more ceremony I adjourned to the\r\nfurther part of the room, and commenced disrobing. Doffing my boots,\r\nwaistcoat, and cravat, and placing my watch and purse under the pillow,\r\nI gave a moment's thought to what a certain not very old lady, whom I\r\nhad left at home, might say when she heard of my lodging with a\r\ngrass-widow and three young girls, and sprung into bed. There I removed\r\nmy undermentionables, which were still too damp to sleep in, and in\r\nabout two minutes and thirty seconds sunk into oblivion.\r\n\r\nA few streaks of grayish light were beginning to creep through the\r\ncrevices in the logs, when a movement at the foot of the bed awakened\r\nme, and glancing downward I beheld the youngest girl emerging from under\r\nthe clothes at my feet. She had slept there, 'cross-wise,' all night. A\r\nstir in the adjoining bed soon warned me that the other feminines were\r\npreparing to follow her example; so, turning my face to the wall, I\r\nfeigned to be asleep. Their toilet was soon made, and they then quietly\r\nleft Scip and myself in full possession of the premises.\r\n\r\nThe darky rose as soon as they were gone, and, coming to me, said,--\r\n\r\n'Massa, we'd better be gwine. I'se got your cloes all dry, and you can\r\nrig up and breakfust at de Cunnel's.'\r\n\r\nThe storm had cleared away, and the sun was struggling to get through\r\nthe distant pines, when Scipio brought the horse to the door, and we\r\nprepared to start. Turning to the old woman, I said,\r\n\r\n'I feel greatly obliged to you, madam, for the shelter you have given\r\nus, and would like to make you some recompense for your trouble. Please\r\nto tell me what I shall pay you.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, stranger, we don't gin'rally take in lodgers, but seein' as how as\r\nthar ar tu on ye, and ye've had a good night on it, I don't keer if ye\r\npay me tu dollars.'\r\n\r\nThat struck me as 'rather steep' for 'common doin's,' particularly as we\r\nhad furnished the food and 'the drinks;' yet, saying nothing, I handed\r\nher a two-dollar bank note. She took it, and held it up curiously to the\r\nsun, then in a moment handed it back, saying, 'I don't know nothin'\r\n'bout that ar sort of money; hain't you got no silver?'\r\n\r\nI fumbled in my pocket a moment, and found a quarter-eagle, which I gave\r\nher.\r\n\r\n'I hain't got nary a fip o' change,' she said, as she took it.\r\n\r\n'Oh! never mind the change, madam; I shall want to stop and _look_ at\r\nyou when I return,' I replied, good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n'Ha! ha! yer a chicken,' said the woman, at the same time giving me a\r\ngentle poke in the ribs. Fearing she might, in the exuberance of her joy\r\nat the sight of the money, proceed to some more decided demonstration of\r\naffection, I hastily stepped into the wagon, bade her good-by, and was\r\noff.\r\n\r\nWe were still among the pines, which towered gigantically all around us,\r\nbut were no longer alone. Every tree was scarified for turpentine, and\r\nthe forest was alive with negro men and women gathering the 'last\r\ndipping,' or clearing away the stumps and underbrush preparatory to the\r\nspring work. It was Christmas week; but, as I afterwards learned, the\r\nColonel's negroes were accustomed to doing 'half tasks' at that season,\r\nbeing paid for their labor as if they were free. They stopped their work\r\nas we rode by, and stared at us with a sort of stupid, half-frightened\r\ncuriosity, very much like the look of a cow when a railway train is\r\npassing. It needed but little observation to conclude that their\r\n_status_ was but one step above the level of the brutes.\r\n\r\nAs we rode along I said to the driver, 'Scipio, what did you think of\r\nour lodgings?'\r\n\r\n'Mighty pore, massa. Niggas lib better'n dat.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I replied, 'but these folks despise you blacks; they seem to be\r\nboth poor and proud.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, dey'm pore 'cause dey won't work, and dey'm proud 'cause\r\ndey'r white. Dey won't work 'cause dey see de darky slaves doin' it, and\r\ntink it am beneaf white folks to do as de darkies do. Dis habin' slaves\r\nkeeps dis hull country pore.'\r\n\r\n'Who told you that?' I asked, astonished at hearing a remark showing so\r\nmuch reflection from a negro.\r\n\r\n'Nobody, massa, I see it myseff.'\r\n\r\n'Are there many of these poor whites around Georgetown?'\r\n\r\n'Not many 'round Georgetown, sar, but great many in de up-country har,\r\nand dey'm all 'like--pore and no account; none ob 'em kin read, and dey\r\nall eat clay.'\r\n\r\n'Eat clay!' I said; 'what do you mean by that?'\r\n\r\n'Didn't you see, massa, how yaller all dem wimmin war? Dat's 'cause dey\r\neat clay. De little children begin 'fore dey can walk, and dey eat it\r\ntill dey die; dey chaw it like 'backer. It makes all dar stumacs big,\r\nlike as you seed 'em, and spiles dar 'gestion. It am mighty onhealfy.'\r\n\r\n'Can it be possible that human beings do such things! The brutes\r\nwouldn't do that.'\r\n\r\n'No, massa, but _dey_ do it; dey'm pore trash. Dat's what de big folks\r\ncall 'em, and it am true; dey'm long way lower down dan de darkies.'\r\n\r\nBy this time we had arrived at the run. We found the bridge carried\r\naway, as the woman had told us; but its abutments were still standing,\r\nand over these planks had been laid, which afforded a safe crossing for\r\nfoot-passengers. To reach these planks, however, it was necessary to\r\nwade into the stream for full fifty yards, the 'run' having overflowed\r\nits banks for that distance on either side of the bridge. The water was\r\nevidently receding, but, as we could not well wait, like the man in the\r\nfable, for it all to run by, we alighted, and counseled as to the best\r\nmode of making the passage.\r\n\r\nScipio proposed that he should wade in to the first abutment, ascertain\r\nthe depth of the stream, and then, if it was not found too deep for the\r\nhorse to ford to that point, we would drive that far, get out, and walk\r\nto the end of the planking, leading the horse, and then again mount the\r\nwagon at the further end of the bridge. We were sure the horse would\r\nhave to swim in the middle of the current, and perhaps for a\r\nconsiderable distance beyond; but, having witnessed his proficiency in\r\naquatic performances, we had no doubt of his getting safely across.\r\n\r\nThe darky's plan was decided on, and divesting himself of his trowsers,\r\nhe waded into the 'run' to take the soundings.\r\n\r\nWhile he was in the water my attention was attracted to a printed paper,\r\nposted on one of the pines near the roadside. Going up to it, I read as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     $250 REWARD.\r\n\r\n     Ran Away from the subscriber, on Monday, November 12th, his mulatto\r\n     man, SAM. Said boy is stout-built, five feet nine inches\r\n     high, 31 years old, weighs 170 lbs., and walks very erect, and with\r\n     a quick, rapid gait. The American flag is tattooed on his right arm\r\n     above the elbow. There is a knife-cut over the bridge of his nose,\r\n     a fresh bullet-wound in his left thigh, and his back bears marks of\r\n     a recent whipping. He is supposed to have made his way back to\r\n     Dinwiddie County, Va., where he was raised, or to be lurking in the\r\n     swamps in this vicinity.\r\n\r\n     The above reward will be paid for his confinement in any jail in\r\n     North or South Carolina, or Virginia, or for his delivery to the\r\n     subscriber on his plantation at ----. D. W. J----. ----, December\r\n     2, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe name signed to this hand-bill was that of the planter I was about to\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nScipio having returned, reporting the stream fordable to the bridge, I\r\nsaid to him, pointing to the 'notice,'--\r\n\r\n'Read that, Scip.'\r\n\r\nHe read it, but made no remark.\r\n\r\n'What does it mean--that fresh bullet wound, and the marks of a recent\r\nwhipping?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'It mean, massa, dat de darky hab run away, and ben took; and dat when\r\ndey took him dey shot him, and flogged him arter dat. Now, he hab run\r\naway agin. De Cunnel's mighty hard on his niggas!'\r\n\r\n'Is he! I can scarcely believe that.'\r\n\r\n'He am, massa; but he ain't so much to blame, nuther; dey'm awful bad\r\nset, most ob 'em,--so dey say.'\r\n\r\nOur conversation was here interrupted by our reaching the bridge. After,\r\nsafely 'walking the plank,' and making our way to the opposite bank, I\r\nresumed it by asking,--\r\n\r\n'Why are the Colonel's negroes so particularly bad?'\r\n\r\n'Cause, you see, massa, de turpentime business hab made great profits\r\nfor sum yars now, and de Cunnel hab been gettin' rich bery fass. He hab\r\nput all his money, jes so fass as he made it, into darkies, so as to\r\nmake more; for he's got berry big plantation, and need nuffin' but\r\ndarkies to work it to make money jess like a gold mine. He goes up to\r\nVirginny to buy niggas; and up dar _now_ dey don't sell none less dey'm\r\nbad uns, 'cep when sum massa die or git pore. Virginny darkies dat cum\r\ndown har ain't gin'rally of much account. Dey'm either kinder\r\ngood-for-nuffin, or dey'm ugly; and de Cunnel d'rather hab de ugly dan\r\nde no-account niggas.'\r\n\r\n'How many negroes has he?'\r\n\r\n''Bout two hundred, men and wimmin, I b'lieve, massa.'\r\n\r\n'It can't be very pleasant for his family to remain in such an\r\nout-of-the-way place, with such a gang of negroes about them, and no\r\nwhite people near.'\r\n\r\n'No, massa, not in dese times; but de missus and de young lady ain't dar\r\nnow.'\r\n\r\n'Not there now? The Colonel said nothing to me about that. Are you\r\nsure?'\r\n\r\n'Oh yas, massa; I seed 'em go off on de boat to Charles'n most two weeks\r\nago. Dey don't mean to cum back till tings am more settled; dey'm 'fraid\r\nto stay dar.'\r\n\r\n'I should think it wouldn't be safe for even the Colonel there, if a\r\ndisturbance broke out among the slaves.'\r\n\r\n''Twouldn't be safe den anywhar, sar; but de Cunnel am berry brave man.\r\nHe'm better dan twenty of _his_ niggas.'\r\n\r\n'Why better than twenty of _his_ niggers?'\r\n\r\n''Cause dem ugly niggas am gin'rally cowards. De darky dat is quiet,\r\n'spectful, and does his duty, am de brave sort; _dey'll_ fight, massa,\r\ntill dey'm cut down.'\r\n\r\nWe had here reached a turn in the road, and passing it, came suddenly\r\nupon a coach, attached to which were a pair of magnificent grays, driven\r\nby a darky in livery.\r\n\r\n'Hallo dar!' said Scipio to the driver, as we came nearly abreast of the\r\ncarriage. 'Am you Cunnel J----'s man?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, I is dat,' replied the darky.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a woolley head, which I recognized at once as that of the\r\nColonel's man 'Jim,' was thrust out of the window of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n'Hallo, Jim,' I said. 'How do you do? I'm glad to see you.'\r\n\r\n'Lor bress me, massa K----, am dat you?' exclaimed the astonished negro,\r\nhastily opening the door, and coming to me. 'Whar _did_ you cum from?\r\nI'se mighty glad to see you;' at the same time giving my hand a hearty\r\nshaking. I must here say, in justice to the reputation of South\r\nCarolina, that no respectable Carolinian refuses to shake hands with a\r\nblack man, unless--the black happens to be free.\r\n\r\n'I thought I wouldn't wait for you,' I replied. 'But how did you expect\r\nto get on? the \"runs\" have swollen into rivers.'\r\n\r\n'We got a \"flat\" made for dis one,--it's down dar by dis time,--de oders\r\nwe tought we'd get ober sumhow.'\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK FREEMASONRY.\r\n\r\n'Jim, this is Scip,' I said, seeing that the darkies had taken no notice\r\nof each other.\r\n\r\n'How d'ye do, Scipio?' said Jim, extending his hand to him. A look of\r\nsingular intelligence passed over the faces of the two negroes as their\r\nhands met; it vanished in an instant, and was so slight that none but a\r\nclose observer would have detected it, but some words that Scip had\r\npreviously let drop put me on the alert, and I felt sure it had a hidden\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n'Won't you get into de carriage, massa?' inquired Jim.\r\n\r\n'No, thank you, Jim. I'll ride on with Scip. Our horse is jaded, and you\r\nhad better go ahead.'\r\n\r\nJim mounted the driver's seat, turned the carriage, and drove off at a\r\nbrisk pace to announce our coming at the plantation, while Scip and I\r\nrode on at a slower gait.\r\n\r\n'Scip, did you know Jim before?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Neber seed him afore, massa, but hab heern ob him.'\r\n\r\n'How is it that you have lived in Georgetown for five years, and he only\r\nseventy miles off, and you never have seen him?'\r\n\r\n'I cud hab seed him, massa, good many time, ef I'd liked, but darkies\r\nhab to be careful.'\r\n\r\n'Careful of what?'\r\n\r\n'Careful ob who dey knows; good many bad niggas 'bout.'\r\n\r\n'Pshaw, Scip, you're \"coming de possum;\" that game won't work with me.\r\nThere isn't a better nigger than Jim in all South Carolina. I know him\r\nwell.'\r\n\r\n'P'raps he am; reckon he _am_ a good enuff nigga.'\r\n\r\n'Good enough nigga, Scip! Why, I tell you he's a splendid fellow; just\r\nas true as steel. He's been North with the Colonel, often, and the\r\nAbolitionists have tried to get him away; he knew he could go, but\r\nwouldn't budge an inch.'\r\n\r\n'I knew he wouldn't,' said the darky, a pleasurable gleam passing\r\nthrough his eyes; 'dat sort don't run; dey face de music!'\r\n\r\n'Why don't they run? What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Nuffin', massa,--only dey'd ruther stay har.'\r\n\r\n'Come, Scip, you've played this game long enough. Tell me, now, what\r\nthat look you gave each other when you shook hands meant.'\r\n\r\n'What look, massa? Oh! I s'pose 'twar 'cause we'd both _heerd_ ob each\r\noder afore.'\r\n\r\n''Twas more than that, Scip. Be frank; you know you can trust me.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, den, massa,' he replied, adding, after a short pause, 'de ole\r\nwoman called you a Yankee,--you can guess.'\r\n\r\n'If I should guess,'twould be that it meant _mischief_.'\r\n\r\n'It don't mean mischief, sar,' said the darky, with a tone and air that\r\nwould not have disgraced a Cabinet officer; 'it mean only RIGHT\r\nand JUSTICE.'\r\n\r\n'It means that there is some secret understanding between you.'\r\n\r\n'I tole you, massa,' he replied, relapsing into his usual manner, 'dat\r\nde blacks am all Freemasons. I gabe Jim de grip, and he know'd me. He'd\r\nha known my name ef you hadn't tole him.'\r\n\r\n'Why would he have known your name?'\r\n\r\n''Cause I gabe de grip, dat tole him.'\r\n\r\n'Why did he call you Scip_io_? I called you _Scip_.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! de darkies all do dat. Nobody but de white folks call me _Scip_. I\r\ncan't say no more, massa; I SHUD BREAK DE OATH EF I DID!'\r\n\r\n'You have said enough, Scipio, to satisfy me that there is a secret\r\nleague among the blacks, and that you are a leader in it. Now, I tell\r\nyou, you'll get yourself into a scrape. I've taken a liking to you,\r\nScip, and I should be _very sorry_ to see you run yourself into danger.'\r\n\r\n'I tank you, massa, from de bottom ob my soul I tank you,' he said, as\r\nthe tears moistened his eyes. 'You bery kind, massa; it do me good to\r\ntalk wid you. But what am my life wuth? What am any _slave's_ life wuth?\r\nEf you war me you'd do like me!'\r\n\r\nI could not deny it, and made no reply.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this article is aware that he is here making an important\r\nstatement, and one that may be called in question by those persons who\r\nare accustomed to regard the Southern blacks as only reasoning brutes.\r\nThe great mass of them are but a little above the brutes in their habits\r\nand instincts, but a large body are fully on a par, except in mere\r\nbook-education, with their white masters.\r\n\r\nThe conversation above recorded is, _verbatim et literatim_, TRUE. It\r\ntook place at the time indicated, and was taken down, as were other\r\nconversations recorded in these papers, within twenty-four hours after\r\nits occurrence. The name and the locality, only, I have, for very\r\nevident reasons, disguised.\r\n\r\nFrom this conversation, together with previous ones, held with the same\r\nnegro, and from after developments made to me at various places, and at\r\ndifferent times, extending over a period of six weeks, I became\r\nacquainted with the fact--and I _know_ it to be a _fact_--that there\r\nexists among the blacks a secret and wide-spread organization of a\r\nMasonic character, having its grip, pass-word, and oath. It has various\r\ngrades of leaders, who are competent and _earnest_ men, and its ultimate\r\nobject is FREEDOM. It is quite as wide-spread, and much more\r\nsecret, than the order of the 'Knights of the Golden Circle,' the\r\nkindred league among the whites.\r\n\r\nThis latter organization, which was instituted by John C. Calhoun,\r\nWilliam L. Porcher, and others, as far back as 1835, has for its sole\r\nobject the dissolution of the Union, and the establishment of a Southern\r\nEmpire;--Empire is the word, not Confederacy, or Republic;--and it was\r\nsolely by means of its secret but powerful machinery that the Southern\r\nStates were plunged into revolution, in defiance of the will of a\r\nmajority of their voting population.\r\n\r\nNearly every man of influence at the South (and many a pretended Union\r\nman at the North) is a member of this organization, and sworn, under the\r\npenalty of assassination, to labor, 'in season and out of season, by\r\nfair means and by foul, at all times, and on all occasions,' for the\r\naccomplishment of its object. The blacks are bound together by a similar\r\noath, and only _bide their time_.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the real state of political affairs, which the negroes\r\nhave acquired through this organization, is astonishingly accurate;\r\ntheir leaders possess every essential of leadership,--except, it may be,\r\nmilitary skill,--and they are fully able to cope with the whites.\r\n\r\nThe negro whom I call Scipio, on the day when Major Anderson evacuated\r\nFort Moultrie, and before he or I knew of that event, which set all\r\nSouth Carolina in a blaze, foretold to me the breaking out of this war\r\nin Charleston harbor, and as confidently predicted that it would result\r\nin the freedom of the slaves!\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of this organization I acquired by gaining the confidence\r\nof some of the blacks, who knew me to be a Northern man, and supposed I\r\nsympathized with them. Having acquired it in that manner, I could not\r\ncommunicate it; but now, when our troops have landed in South Carolina,\r\nand its existence is sure to be speedily developed, no harm can result\r\nfrom this announcement.\r\n\r\nThe fact of its existing is not positively known (for the black is more\r\nsubtle and crafty than anything human), but is suspected, by many of the\r\nwhites; the more moderate of whom are disposed to ward off the impending\r\nblow by some system of gradual emancipation,--declaring all black\r\nchildren born after a certain date free,--or by some other action that\r\nwill pacify and keep down the slaves. These persons, however, are but a\r\nsmall minority, and possess no political power, and the South is rushing\r\nblindly on to a catastrophe, which, if not averted by the action of our\r\ngovernment, will make the horrors of San Domingo and the French\r\nRevolution grow pale in history.\r\n\r\nI say the action of our government, for with it rests the\r\nresponsibility. What the black wants is freedom. Give him that, and he\r\nwill have no incentive to insurrection. If emancipation is proclaimed at\r\nthe head of our armies,--emancipation for _all_--confiscation for the\r\nslaves of rebels, compensation for the slaves of loyal citizens,--the\r\nblacks will rush to the aid of our troops, the avenging angel will pass\r\nover the homes of the many true and loyal men who are still left at the\r\nSouth, and the thunderbolts of this war will fall only--where they\r\nshould fall--on the heads of its blood-stained authors. If this is not\r\ndone, after we have put down the whites we shall have to meet the\r\nblacks, and after we have waded knee-deep in the blood of both, we shall\r\nend the war where it began, but with the South desolated by fire and\r\nsword, the North impoverished and loaded down with an everlasting debt,\r\nand our once proud, happy and glorious country the by-word and scorn of\r\nthe whole civilized world.\r\n\r\nI have all my life long been a true friend to the South. My connections,\r\nmy interests, and my sympathies are all there, and there are those now\r\nin the ranks of this rebellion who are of my own blood; but I say, and I\r\nwould to God that every lover of his country would say it with me, 'Make\r\nno peace with it until slavery is exterminated.' Slavery is its very\r\nbones, marrow, and life-blood, and you can not put it down till you have\r\ndestroyed that accursed institution. If a miserable peace is patched up\r\nbefore a death-stroke is given to slavery, it will gather new strength,\r\nand drive freedom from this country forever. In the nature of things it\r\ncan not exist in the same hemisphere with liberty. Then let every man\r\nwho loves his country determine that if this war must needs last for\r\ntwenty years, it shall not end until this root of all our political\r\nevils is weeded out forever.\r\n\r\nA short half-hour took us to the plantation, where I found the Colonel\r\non the piazza awaiting me. After our greeting was over, noticing my\r\nsoiled and rather dilapidated condition, he inquired where I had passed\r\nthe night. I told him, when he burst into a hearty fit of laughter, and\r\nfor several days good-naturedly bantered me about 'putting up' at the\r\nmost aristocratic hotel in South Carolina,--the 'Mills House.'\r\n\r\nWe soon entered the mansion, and the reader will, I trust, excuse me, if\r\nI leave him standing in its door-way till another month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LESSON OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lex est, non poena, perire.--_Martial._\r\n\r\n  Ye warriors of the past, whose flashing swords\r\n    Light up with fitful gleams the misty night\r\n  Of half-forgotten eld, in fiery words\r\n    Ye teach a truth 'twere well we read aright.\r\n\r\n  God sends the gentle breeze to woo the flower,\r\n    And stir the pulses of the ripening corn;\r\n  He, too, lets loose the whirlwind's vengeful power\r\n    To quench the plagues of foul stagnation born.\r\n\r\n  And thus in love, sometimes disguised as wrath,\r\n    He sends his hidden blessings in the storm,\r\n  Which dashes down in its resistless path\r\n    The hoar abuses that defied reform.\r\n\r\n  When Cyrus ravaged fair Chaldea's plain,\r\n    And mocked the strength of Babylon's haughty wall,\r\n  The proud Assyrian's guilt had earned the chain,\r\n    And man rejoiced to mark the oppressor's fall.\r\n\r\n  And when, made drunk with power, the Persian lost\r\n    The stern and simple virtues of his sires,\r\n  His empire's ruin and his slaughtered host\r\n    Kindled in Greece her world-illuming fires.\r\n\r\n  Then Greece, her swift career of glory stayed,\r\n    Exhausted by her madman's triumphs lay,\r\n  Till Rome's protecting arm the loss repaid\r\n    Of Corinth's sack and Pydua's fatal day.\r\n\r\n  Imperial Rome! though crime succeeded crime\r\n    As earth fell prostrate 'neath her giant tread,\r\n  Still shall her subjects reap to endless time\r\n    The priceless harvests by her wisdom spread.\r\n\r\n  What though the stern proconsul's grinding rule\r\n    Close followed on the legion's merciless sword?\r\n  Laws, arts, and culture, in that rigid school,\r\n    Evoked a nation from each savage horde.\r\n\r\n  And when at last her crimes, reacting, wrought\r\n    Their curse upon herself, to her, supine\r\n  And helpless, the barbarian spoiler brought,\r\n    With fire and sword, new life to her decline.\r\n\r\n  Theodoric, Clovis, Charles, your endless strife,\r\n    From Weser's marsh to Naples' laughing bay,\r\n  Was but the throe that marked the nascent life\r\n    Emerging from the worn-out world's decay.\r\n\r\n  Ye were, amid that elemental war,\r\n    But straws to show its course. Ye toiled, and won,\r\n  Or lost; your people bled--yet slow and far\r\n    The mighty cause of man pressed ever on.\r\n\r\n  Long has that travail been. Kings, Kaisers, Popes,\r\n    The stern Crusader and the pirate Dane,\r\n  Each, centered in his own ambitious hopes,\r\n    But helped the cause he labored to restrain.\r\n\r\n  Hildebrand's voice sets Christendom on fire;\r\n    'Neath Frederic's plow sinks Milan's lofty wall;\r\n  Unnumbered victims glut De Montfort's ire;\r\n    From Ecclin's dungeon shrieks the night appall.\r\n\r\n  If the tide ebbs, 'tis but to flow again.\r\n    Each fierce convulsion gains some vantage ground.\r\n  Man's fettered limbs grow stronger, and the chain\r\n    Falls link by link at each tumultuous bound.\r\n\r\n  The timid burgher dons the helm and shield,\r\n    The wretched hind reluctant grasps the bow,\r\n  To fight their master's quarrels. Courtrai's field\r\n    And Sempach's hill that lesson's worth may show.\r\n\r\n  The restless soul still yearns for things unknown;\r\n    It chafes against its bondage, points the way\r\n  That leads to freedom, but the sword alone\r\n    Makes good the dreams that else would but betray.\r\n\r\n  See, Luther speaks, and Europe flies to arms:\r\n    Her stubborn fight outlasts a hundred years;\r\n  A thousand fields her richest life-blood warms,\r\n    Yet gain the vanquished more than pays their tears.\r\n\r\n  If Orange and Gustavus conquering died,\r\n    Not Coligny nor Hampden fell in vain,\r\n  For one domain escaped the furious tide,\r\n    And peace made that one desolate--chivalrous Spain!\r\n\r\n  So, when the traitorous truth was whispered round,--\r\n    Equality for man on earth as heaven,--\r\n  It was but speculation's idlest sound,\r\n    Till by the sword the time-worn bonds were riven.\r\n\r\n  Though Moscow, Leipzig, Waterloo, might seem\r\n    To roll the tide back, they but marked its flood;\r\n  Nor could the Holy Allies' darkest scheme\r\n    Restore the wrongs so well effaced in blood.\r\n\r\n  The end is not yet. God's mysterious way\r\n    Evolves its purpose in its destined time.\r\n  Vainly we seek its fated march to stay:\r\n    All things subserve it--wisdom, folly, crime.\r\n\r\n  We are his instruments. The past has fled\r\n    For us. We suffer for the future dim.\r\n  Then sternly face the darkness round us spread,\r\n    Do each his duty--leave the rest to Him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRALPH WALDO EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nineteenth Century dawned upon a nation already glorious with the\r\nsublime promise of a prophetic infancy. The strong serpents of Tyranny\r\nand Superstition had been crushed in its powerful grasp. The songs of\r\ntwo oceans--the lullaby of its earlier days--had cheered it on to a\r\nyouth whose dignity and beauty were bought with sword and rifle, with\r\nblood and death. Wrapped at last in the _toga_ of an undisputed manhood,\r\nit took its place among the empires of the earth, the son of a king,\r\nmightier than all; free to enact new laws, to promulgate new systems of\r\neconomy, social and political, free to worship and to think. With what\r\nsuccess a government grounded on a principle so faultless has been\r\nadministered, may not now be written, but is not more doubtful than it\r\nwas when the drum beat its _reveillé_ only on our distant frontiers, and\r\nthe booming of guns from ship or shore was but the nation's welcome to\r\ndays made memorable by its great men. But before the new republic\r\nstretched a vast field for thought, and within its almost boundless\r\nlimits, hidden beneath the husks of old theories, lay the seed ready for\r\nthe ripening. Far back toward the east rolled, like a mighty desert, the\r\nhistory of the Progress of Mind. Here and there, on its arid surface,\r\nrose, stately and awe-inspiring, great pyramids which marked those eras\r\nof agitation when Humanity, awaking suddenly to her power, grappled with\r\ngiant strength the mighty enigmas of Being, and endeavored to wrench\r\nfrom their mute souls the great secrets that Faith alone has expounded\r\nto the satisfaction of her devotees. It availed little that one by one,\r\nin the vaults of these temples, the axioms and deductions of their\r\nfounders were laid away lifeless and powerless. Another generation,\r\nvigorous and persevering, laid stone after stone the foundations of\r\nanother edifice that strove to reach, with its yearning apex of desire,\r\nthe very heavens. Still high and unmoved curved the blue infinitude\r\nabove, while below its mirror in the soul of man surged wildly against\r\nshores stern, rock-bound, immutable, unanswering.\r\n\r\nThe 'limits of the forefathers' (_fines quos posuerunt patres nostri_)\r\nhad been first transgressed by Abelard, and the speculating spirit of\r\nScholasticism disseminated by him overwhelmed Europe with that rage for\r\ninvestigations, so futile yet so laborious, that terrified the\r\ntheologians of the mediæval church, and marked the first modern epoch in\r\nPhilosophy--the beginning of the revolt of Reason against Authority.\r\nNext, colossal against the still unrelenting skies, towered what may be\r\ncalled the _Natur-Philosophie_, 'Nature Philosophy' of Giordano Bruno.\r\nThe echoes of Luther's bugle still pierced the mountain-fastnesses of\r\nNorthern Italy and the gorges of Spain. In the church, Bruno found only\r\nskepticism and licentiousness, ignorance and tyranny. Before him four\r\ncenturies had been swallowed up in debate on the fruitless question of\r\nNominalism, and others equally insignificant, but were visible to him by\r\nthe light of a logic so shallow, futile, and despotic, that it was known\r\nonly to be scorned. With an energy that astonished the feeble and\r\ndegraded clergy of his time, a fearlessness that exacted the admiration\r\nwhile it aroused the indignation of his contemporaries, and a genius\r\nthat compelled the attention of those who were most zealous to combat\r\nits evidences, Bruno, casting off the shackles of the cloister, that\r\n'_prigione angusta e nera_,' boldly advanced a system of Philosophy,\r\nstartling, in those Inquisitorial times, from its independence, and\r\nhorrible from its antagonism to Aristotle, the Atlas of the church. This\r\nwas no less than pure Pantheism,--God in and through all, the infinite\r\nIntelligence. _Deus est monadum monas--nempe entium entitas_. This\r\ncreed, by an incomprehensible metamorphosis, was styled, in the language\r\nof the day, Atheism; its promulgation, even its conception, was\r\npronounced a crime whose penalty was death. And Bruno, who, from the\r\ndepths of infamous superstition, had risen into the pure light of\r\nheaven, to a theory whose principles, though they might not satisfy,\r\ncould not fail to refine, elevate, and encourage the soul long groveling\r\nin the mire of ignorance, or languishing in the dark dungeons of\r\nScholasticism,--Bruno died for the truth. More foolish than the savages\r\nof whom Montesquieu speaks, who cut down trees to reach their fruit,\r\nthese judges of Bruno destroyed the tree whose seeds were already strewn\r\nbroadcast over the world. They hushed forever the voice whose echoes are\r\nnot yet stilled,--echoes that resound in the cautious _Meditations_ of\r\nDescartes, that rise from peak to peak of the majestic method of the\r\ngreat Spinoza, who was no less a martyr because reputation and not life\r\nwas the forfeit of his earnestness; and that vibrate with thrilling\r\nsweetness in the Idealism of Schelling. 'The perfect theory of Nature,'\r\nsays Schelling, 'is that by virtue of which all Nature is resolved into\r\nthe intellectual element,' which 'intellectual element' is at once\r\ncomposed of intuitions and is the source of intuitions,--the _Deus in\r\nnobis_ of Giordano Bruno. 'It is evident,' he continues, 'that Nature is\r\noriginally identical with that which in us is recognized as the subject\r\nand the object.'\r\n\r\nThus the empirical school, in its representative, Aristotle, met in the\r\nmartyr of Nola an opponent vigilant, earnest, powerful. And while the\r\nlegitimate prosecution of the former mode of philosophizing has led to\r\ndeism, skepticism, atheism, and materialism, it is to those who have\r\nretained in methods, more mathematically clear and more perfectly\r\ndeveloped than that which Bruno disseminated, but still bearing, as\r\ntheir key-note, the one great idea of his bold crusade,--to those we\r\nmust look for all that is most pure, most noble, in Philosophy: a system\r\nor succession of systems whose primitive idea--substance and essence--is\r\nthe very God for a supposed denial of whom Bruno died. '_Cosi vince\r\nGoffredo!_'\r\n\r\nThus rolled on the centuries. Germany, France, England, and Scotland had\r\neach contributed her knights to the great tournament of Mind. And now\r\nthe first symptoms of agitation appeared on the hitherto unruffled\r\nsurface of Thought in the New World. Still panting after her victories,\r\nscarcely used to her new freedom, at first the presence of a power\r\nantagonistic to the orthodox faith was unsuspected even by those who\r\nfirst entertained it. But the stone had been dashed into the tranquil\r\nocean when the May-flower was moored on the New England coast, and its\r\ncircling eddies drew curve after curve among the descendants, brave,\r\nconscientious, energetic, of the old Puritans. The stern Calvinism, by\r\nwhich their fathers had lived and died, was, by these early recreants,\r\nfirst mistrusted, then questioned, and finally abjured. The murmurs of\r\ndissent that had long agitated the sturdy upholders of the accepted\r\nfaith, broke out in a demand for a system whose claims should be less\r\nabsolute, and whose nature should satisfy those fugitive appeals to\r\nReason and the Understanding, that, weak indeed, and faint, were yet\r\ndistinctly audible to the thinkers of the day. From the cloud of\r\naccusation and denial, of suspicion and trial, the new Perseus,\r\nUnitarianism,--whilom a nursling of Milton, Locke, and Hartley,--was\r\nborn, and took its place among the sects, sustained by the few, dreaded\r\nand condemned by the many.\r\n\r\nTo brand this new theory, no terms were found too strong even by the\r\nreligious periodicals of the day. Unwilling to bide their time, to test\r\nits soundness by its strength and duration, its opponents rested not. It\r\nwas confidently predicted that the movement would influence its\r\nfollowers to skepticism and atheism. The accusation of the sixteenth\r\ncentury was revived, and St. Bernards cried from pulpit and press, 'The\r\nlimits of the forefathers have been transgressed!' To the great mass of\r\nthe opposition, the horror was not that Trinitarianism had been\r\nassailed, but that men had been found so bold as to question it. The\r\ncrime with the unlearned and the majority of the professors was not\r\nheresy, but daring. But Christians, fervent and earnest, were not\r\nwanting who denounced the movement in its anticipated consequences. The\r\nyoung and adventurous, the men of impulse and daring, would drift, it\r\nwas feared, to the very borders of open infidelity. But the contrary was\r\nthe result. A pietism the very reverse was developed, which, aided by\r\nthe beloved Channing, was disseminated through New England. Justice\r\nStory even asserted that in Unitarianism he found refuge from the\r\nskepticism to which in youth he had tended.\r\n\r\nPermitted, by the liberal character of the welcome substitute for a\r\ntheology that had become too stringent for the age, to prosecute their\r\nresearches into fields hitherto forbidden to the orthodox, thinkers,\r\neconomists, statesmen and theologians gathered round the standard, and a\r\nnew impulse was given to the intellectual character of the times. A\r\nrevolution in Thought was impending.\r\n\r\nIn Literature we dared challenge the nations. The popularity of Cooper\r\nwas at its high noon. Irving, with the graphic and delicate strokes of\r\nhis sympathetic pencil, had written himself the Claude Lorraine among\r\n_litterateurs_; and Prescott, with his sentences of granite, was\r\nbuilding himself an immortal name. Still, we were behind Germany, and\r\neven France, in that wide comprehension and universal criticism that\r\ndetermines more accurately than its politics the real _status_ of a\r\nnation. These elements were now to be supplied. Carlyle had played in\r\nEngland the _rôle_ so humorously yet thoroughly enacted in Germany by\r\nHeine, and so gracefully and airily performed in France by Cousin. He\r\nhad _popularized_ the philosophers. Without the acute, electric\r\nperceptions of the great German or the industry and amiable vanities of\r\nthat De Sevigné among philosophers, Cousin, he presented, by fierce\r\ndashes of his crayon, black, blunt, and bluff, to the hitherto ignorant\r\nBritish public, some phases of the great metaphysical bearings of the\r\nage upon Literature and Art, as developed in Teutonic poetry and prose.\r\nIn a word, he familiarized his readers with the _Æsthetik_ of Germany.\r\nHe published in 1830 his _Sartor Resartus_, which, clothing the man in\r\n'_der Gottheit lebendiges Kleid_,' usurped for him at once an office not\r\ninferior to that of the _Erd-geist_ in _Faust_. The shrill notes of the\r\nbagpipe of the critic of Craigenputtock blew across the mountains and\r\nvalleys of his island home, rousing the judge on the bench, and,\r\npenetrating the long halls of Cambridge and Oxford, streamed yet\r\ndistinct and powerful to our shores. Astonished by the richness and\r\nfullness of a literature so comprehensive, which seemed to inclose in\r\nits brilliant mazes all that their meagre and unfruitful dogmas denied\r\nof comfort to the heart and systematic development to the mind, the men\r\nwho, with girded loins and scrips in their hands, had long wandered\r\ndisconsolately on the shores of a seething ocean, now saw its waters\r\nparted, and crossed upon dry ground. Before them stretched the vast\r\nwilderness of German Philosophy. To their bewildered gaze, each system\r\nwas an Arabia Felix, and every axiom a graceful palm.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a second influence was at work among the orthodox, an\r\ninfluence that tended to the same great result, no longer an accident,\r\nbut a necessity of the age. The _Biographia Literaria_ and _The Friend_\r\nof Coleridge, embodying a dwarfed but not distorted version of the\r\nmetaphysical system of Kant, which had created a profound sensation in\r\nEngland, met with an even more enthusiastic reception in this country.\r\nThe Christian character of their author was beyond reproach, his genius\r\nundisputed; as a poet he ranked among those to whom Great Britain owed\r\nthe laurel; and as an essayist, even the bitterest critics yielded him\r\nthe palm. When, therefore, this man, one of the most evangelical of his\r\ntime in the Established Church, brought to the aid of a time-honored and\r\nbeloved theology the principles of that very philosophy which was deemed\r\nby others its fiercest antagonist, not a few who had been hitherto\r\ndeterred from its investigation by a dread of the accusation of heresy,\r\neagerly availed themselves of his labors. His _Aids to Reflection_ was\r\npresented to the American public under the patronage of Dr. Marsh, late\r\npresident of Burlington College, Vt. An elaborate preliminary essay by\r\nthis eminently pious clergyman established the claims of the work to\r\nfavor, and it was even taken up as a text-book in Amherst and one or two\r\nliberal Congregational universities in New England.\r\n\r\nThe effort of Coleridge, rendered obscure by his turgid and florid\r\nstyle, was to explain the religious doctrines of Archbishop Leighton and\r\nthe early Puritans, which he held as orthodox, by means of the momentous\r\ndistinction between Reason and the Understanding, which he borrowed from\r\nthe _Critik der Reinen Vernunft_ of Kant. However plausible, when\r\ndisencumbered of its poetical drapery, the theory of Coleridge may be,\r\nand however convincing, _so far as it goes_, of the truth of his\r\nprinciples, we can not forget that the final tendency of the critical\r\nphilosophy of Kant is, if not a positive approach to skepticism, at\r\nleast to afford a scientific basis for it. But the formula of the author\r\nof Christabel was the pure exponent of his creed. The terror of\r\nmetaphysics vanished as the oft-repeated words met the eye of the wary\r\nand suspicious investigator. 'World--God = 0: God--world = Reality\r\nAbsolute. The world without God is nothing: God without the world is\r\nalready, in and of himself, absolute perfection, absolute authority.'\r\n\r\nThus, while Carlyle, bold, versatile, shrewd, untrammeled, worked upon\r\nthe Unitarian element in America, Coleridge, evangelical, polished, yet\r\nadventurous, leavened the Congregationalists and other shades of\r\northodox Christians with the same result. But the first literary\r\noutgrowth and original product of the Transcendental movement in America\r\nwas Emerson's Essay on Nature, which appeared in 1838, forming a nucleus\r\nfor the writings of the Dial-ists, and proving a sort of _prolegomena_\r\nto the new edition of Hermetic Philosophy. '_Non est philosophus nisi\r\nfingit et pinxit_,' said the great pioneer. Here Emerson does both,\r\nproving, by inversion, his claim to the title. Whatever may be the\r\nnegative virtues of this preliminary essay, it undoubtedly possesses the\r\npositive one of having given a strong impulse to the study and love of\r\nNature. True, the man who is to grasp its details, sympathies,\r\nsignifications, to hear, in all their grand harmony, its various\r\ndiscordant symphonies and fugues, to see its marvelous associations,\r\nneeds to be Briarean-armed, Israfel-hearted and Argus-eyed, as perhaps\r\nnone in our imperfect day and generation can claim to be. But at least\r\nthis 'Nature' of Emerson's insinuated, dimly and dreamily, in spite of\r\nits positive air, an occult relation between man and Nature. It invested\r\nrock and sky and air with new and startling attributes. The deep thinker\r\nmight even draw upon its pages some _pays-de-Cocagne_ landscape, flowing\r\nindeed with milk and honey, but in Tantalian distance. Nature's true\r\nheart is invested with a pericardium so thick that it resists the\r\nscalpel of the skillful critics, to whom the stethoscope alone betrays\r\nthe healthful throb of vitality beneath. With portly arguments, Emerson\r\nbars the door to the simple but earnest-hearted. That Nature, whose\r\nprophet he is, gleams, bright and unloving, down from a cold,\r\nunsympathizing heaven.\r\n\r\n  'Not every one doth it beseem to question\r\n  The far-off, high Arcturus.'\r\n\r\nAnd we, the lazzaroni on the piazza, can not even see the sky for the\r\nmist of 'mottoes Italianate and Spanish terms' of an effete logic that\r\nhas risen before it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, here are the first gleams of a genial appreciation of the\r\n_Æsthetik_ of Germany, that large-hearted discernment that grasps\r\nsimilitudes from the antipodes of Thought, and writes them upon its\r\nsunny equator. And there are appeals to those finer impulses and\r\nexperiences of every feeling soul that manifest a sense, imperfect yet\r\nanimated, of that marvelous sympathy that exists between all phases of\r\nlife, whether in humanity or in external nature. His natural outbursts\r\nof feeling are rare, but delicious as _caviare_, with a certain quaver\r\nof piquancy. 'Give me health and a day, and I will make the pomp of\r\nemperors ridiculous. The dawn is my Assyria; the sun-set and moon-rise\r\nmy Paphos and unimaginable realms of faërie; broad noon shall be my\r\nEngland of the senses and the understanding, and night shall be my\r\nGermany of mystic philosophy and dreams.' Only a fantasy, and yet how he\r\nbends Nature to suit the curve of his own temperament. And who has not\r\nfelt the involuntary exhilaration, appalling from its very depth, that\r\npossessed him, crossing a bare common, on a bleak October afternoon,\r\nsunless and chill, with gray winds sweeping by--'I was glad to the brink\r\nof fear.' An intense emotion is imprisoned in these words,--the\r\nirresistible intoxication of deep delight, the consciousness of an\r\nunbounded faculty for enjoyment, and a lurking but delicious dread of\r\nthe lavish power of sensation cooped within the senses. Heine, in his\r\n'Lutetia,' speaks of the 'secret raptures attendant upon the tremors of\r\nfear.' Still, Emerson's Nature is rather a Nature à la Pompadour, in\r\npowdered hair and jeweled stomacher and high-heeled slippers; not the\r\ndear green mother of our dreams, who was wooed by the bending heavens,\r\nand\r\n\r\n  'Myriad myriads of lives teemed forth from the mighty embracement;\r\n  Thousand-fold tribes of dwellers, impelled by thousand-fold instincts,\r\n  Filled, as a dream, the wide waters; the rivers sang on in their\r\n    channels;\r\n  Laughed on their shores the hoarse seas; the yearning ocean swelled\r\n    upward;\r\n  Young life lowed through the meadows, the woods, and the echoing\r\n    mountains,\r\n  Wandered bleating in valleys, and warbled in blossoming branches.'\r\n\r\nBut Nature had been broached and Society was scandalized. Like the\r\nChancellor in Faust, it mounted its tripod and solemnly proclaimed its\r\nverdict upon the inadmissible theory, so inadequately proved of the\r\nidentity of Nature and Spirit. But '_was sagt_ mein Thales?'\r\n\r\n  'Natur und Geist! so spricht man nicht zu Christen:\r\n  Desshalb verbrennt man Atheisten,\r\n  Weil solche Reden höchst gefährlich sind.\r\n  Natur ist Sünde, Geist ist Teufel;\r\n  Sie hegen zwischen sich den Zweifel,\r\n  Ihr miss-gestaltet Zwitterkind.'\r\n\r\nThe Transcendental movement did not fail to attract severe opposition,\r\nnot only to its agitators, but toward the whole body of Unitarians, from\r\na portion of which it in a great measure sprang. If indeed, as Ellis,\r\nits champion, asserts, Transcendentalism was not a native emanation from\r\nNew England, _i.e._, Unitarianism, yet it obviously paved the way for\r\nits entrance, and even erected triumphal arches at intervals over its\r\nprojected route. The consequence of the renewed attack upon this already\r\nsorely aggrieved sect was its virtual separation into moderates and\r\nextremists: the one holding to its primitive theories, the other\r\ninclining graciously to the more comprehensive and fascinating, because\r\nmore liberal and mystical, tenets of the new faith. The Rev. Andrew\r\nNorton, an eminent Unitarian divine of the old school, in a discourse\r\nbefore the Alumni of the Cambridge Theological School, took occasion to\r\nattack with great vigor what he termed the 'new form of infidelity.'\r\nThis and his subsequent replies were most ably answered by George\r\nRipley, a zealous and genial scholar, eminent in belles-lettres and\r\nphilosophy, in his 'Letters on the latest form of Infidelity, including\r\nthe Opinions of Spinoza, Schleiermacher, and De Wette. Boston, James\r\nMunroe & Co., 1840.'\r\n\r\nThis contest constituted the central polemic of the strife. Chilled by\r\nthe cold breath of popular intolerance, these persecuted advocates of a\r\nmetaphysical faith, which even themselves comprehended but dimly, might\r\nhave warmed their trembling hands by the fire of that _auto da fé_ whose\r\nflames three centuries have not extinguished. Even those most opposed by\r\nculture and habit to the innovators, could not but acknowledge that the\r\n_Bestia Triofante_, that Giordano Bruno undertook to expel, was still\r\nrampant and powerful in the midst of a civilized and intelligent\r\ncommunity. The fact was that the Transcendentalists were as much\r\nastonished at this accusation of infidelity as even Fénélon himself\r\ncould have been. They were men of irreproachable character, the majority\r\nreligious by nature and scholarly by disposition, and they found in\r\ntheir new field scope for an increased piety and a more enlarged\r\nbenevolence. Their infinitely pliable philosophy expanded amiably to\r\nsuit the requirements of any and every sect. The Rev. W. H. Furness, of\r\nPhiladelphia, though not thoroughly identified with the movement, yet,\r\nin several volumes published at that time, manifested the influence of\r\nRationalism upon his own studies. But the machinery of his mind, though\r\nexquisite in its details, was too delicate to work up successfully the\r\nheavy material of the German importations. In a review of his 'Life of\r\nJesus,' by A. P. Peabody, in the _N. A. Review_, after a merited tribute\r\nof praise and respect to the talented author, occurs the following:\r\n'Æsthetic considerations weigh more with him than historical proofs, and\r\nvividness of conception than demonstration. So far is he from needing\r\nfacts to verify his theories, that he is ready to reject the best\r\nauthenticated facts, if they would not flow necessarily from his _à\r\npriori_ reasoning.' This was severe, too severe in the instance cited;\r\nbut the remark is worth preserving, as strikingly characteristic of much\r\nof the _belles-lettres_ writings of the New School of thinkers, as they\r\nwere once, and indeed might yet be termed. But impiety was never the\r\nresult of Transcendentalism. Its advocates endeavored rather to prove\r\nthe adaptability of a generous and catholic spirit of Philosophy to\r\nreligion than to subvert it. They never advanced to a love of Strauss\r\nand Feuerbach, and men of the second generation, of whom G.H. Lewes may\r\nbe taken as a type, have generally been regarded by them as the\r\nGirondists regarded the Jacobins. Both urge reform, the Vergniaud and\r\nthe Robespierre, but the one respects the old landmarks, while the\r\nother, with an unequaled nonchalance, sweeps by, unconscious of them\r\nall, and plants his standard on a foundation as yet unshaken by foot of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the Transcendental movement were truly remarkable.\r\nThose latitudes to which habit had accustomed us to look for our\r\n_literati_ became one immense hot-house, in which exotics of the most\r\npowerful fragrance bloomed luxuriantly.[4] As if by miracle, they\r\nassumed hues and adopted habits to which, in their native soil, they\r\nhad been strangers. Every small _litterateur_ wore conspicuously his\r\ncunningly entwined wreath. Ladies appeared at 'æsthetic tea-parties,'\r\ncrowned with the most delicate of the new importations. Young clergymen\r\nwere not complete without a flower in their button-holes, and the tables\r\nof staid old professors groaned beneath the weight of huge pyramidal\r\nbouquets. The cursory examination of foreign literature had given rise\r\nto an eclecticism which reflected the distinguishing features of that of\r\nCousin, yet went a step further in daring. Yet this was not an\r\neclecticism that, gifted with the power of a king, the dignity of a\r\npriest, and the discernment of a prophet, drew from the treasure-troves\r\nof European libraries only their choicest gems. Diamonds, it is true,\r\nflashed among the spoils; sapphires and emeralds gleamed; but beside\r\nthem lay bits of sandstone and scraps of anthracite, rainbow-tinted,\r\nperhaps, but of an unconquerable opaqueness. And the alchemy that should\r\nhave transmuted these to gold, and educed from the one light and from\r\nthe other majesty, was wanting. A trace of Behmen here, a reading of\r\nCousin's lectures there, some Schiller and more Goethe, some pietism\r\nencouraged by a love of Channing, the American Fénélon, some German\r\nballads and a flavor of Plato,--all these helped the initiated to a\r\ncurious dialect and a curious _mélange_. And this was Transcendentalism.\r\nThe great revelation that the grand Moonsee of the new movement had\r\ndeclared necessary in 1838 had been made; the ninth _avatar_ had\r\ndescended, and men looked about them for the representative of Krishna,\r\nand reverenced him in RALPH WALDO EMERSON. Under his auspices,\r\nthe _Dial_, the organ of the new sect, was published, and the next year,\r\n1841, the first collection of his writings appeared under the simple\r\ncaption _Essays_, followed by a second series in 1847.\r\n\r\nSpite of the fragmentary Germano-pantheism of the new Philosophy, as set\r\nforth in these volumes, that a grand advance had been made upon the old\r\nmodes of thought was proved by the dismay in the opposing ranks. The\r\noutcry against Unitarianism was faint compared with the howls of horror\r\nand defiance that greeted Transcendentalism. The very name was a synonym\r\nfor arrogance. The pride of its opponents was touched. Alarming indeed,\r\nand transcendental beyond conception, were the outpourings of thought\r\nthat anointed the _Dial_ and these _Essays_. The very chrism of\r\nmysticism trickled along their running-titles, and dripped fragrantly\r\nfrom their pages. Not only new opinions, but new words and phrases,\r\npuzzled the uninitiated. Among these were _subjective_ and _objective_,\r\nand the concise, comprehensive Germanisms were assailed as sure evidence\r\nof treason or insanity. He who used them was a marked man, and liable to\r\nfind on the first oyster-shell his sentence of exile from the assemblage\r\nof the faithful. The name of Goethe was as terrible as the sacred 'Om'\r\nof the Brahmins; it was whispered with 'bated breath, and was generally\r\nbelieved to be diabolical _per se_. In short, everything bearing the\r\nstamp of Germany was a bit of sweet, forbidden lore. Travels in that\r\nfog-land by dull old fogies, and simple outlines of its Philosophy by\r\ndivines high in rank, were obtained by stealth, and read in secret by\r\ncollege-boys, with as much zeal as the 'Kisses' of Johannes Secundus or\r\nthe Epigrams of Martial. Even Klopstock's 'Messiah' became gilded with a\r\nsort of delightful impropriety.\r\n\r\nDisapprobation and distrust had merged into abuse and persecution.\r\nOrestes A. Brownson, then drifting with the strong tide of the liberals,\r\npublished in 1840 a sort of pantheistically ending novel, entitled\r\n_Charles Elwood, or the Infidel Converted_. The Rev. Dr. Bright, at\r\npresent editor of the Baptist _Examiner_, was at that tune a bookseller\r\nof the firm of Bennett & Bright, and publisher of the _Baptist\r\nRegister_. When _Charles Elwood_ appeared, he ordered the usual number\r\nof copies; but, discovering the nature of the book, made a Servetus of\r\nthe 'lot' by burning them up in the back-yard of his store. A funeral\r\npyre worthy the admiration and awe it must have excited.\r\n\r\nThe _Essays_ of Emerson were subsequently attacked furiously in the\r\n_Princeton Review_ by Prof. Dod and Jas. W. Alexander. These gentlemen\r\ngave to the world, as criticisms of Emerson and other writers, several\r\ntreatises on Pantheism, aiding the very cause they designed to destroy,\r\nby disseminating among the religious public a statement of the primitive\r\nPhilosophy of the Vedas, and its reflection in Germany and America,\r\nclearer than any that had yet appeared: a task for which their\r\nscholarship and ability eminently fitted them. But in attacking German\r\nPhilosophy, both learned to respect that which was practically useful in\r\nit. Prof. Dod left among his papers an unfinished translation of\r\nSpinoza, and the lamented Dr. Alexander, in his admirable lectures on\r\nliterature to the students of Princeton College, recommended a perusal\r\nof what Kant and other German metaphysicians had written on Æsthetics.\r\nIt is no reflection on the piety or sincerity of these sound divines and\r\nripe scholars that they found something good and useful even in the\r\narmory of the enemy. The last step in piety, as in learning, is always\r\nto that noble liberality which recognizes Truth and Beauty wherever\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nAnd, while the religious reviews abounded in jeremiads and philippies,\r\nthe newspaper wits stood outside and shouted in derision. The game was\r\nindeed too rare to be passed unnoticed. In a poem on Fanny Ellsler\r\n(1841) occurred the following:--\r\n\r\n  Our wits, as usual, late upon the road,\r\n  Pick up what Europe saw long since explode.\r\n  If this you doubt, ask Harvard, she can tell\r\n  How many fragments there from Deutschland fell;\r\n  How many mysteries boggle Cambridge men\r\n  That erst in England boggled Carlyle's pen,\r\n  And will, no doubt, be mysteries again;\r\n  And also what great Coleridge left unsung.\r\n  He, too, saw Germany when very young.'\r\n\r\nTo Emerson, at this moment, numbers looked with the deepest admiration\r\nor with fiercest hate. He was the type of his age, what Carlyle might\r\nperhaps call its 'Priest Vates.' In his _Essays_ he stood aloft and\r\nproclaimed, 'In me is the kernel of truth: eat and live!' But the shell\r\nthat enclosed the kernel was hard to crack, and was, moreover, like the\r\n'Sileni' of the old French apothecaries, as described by Rabelais, so\r\ndecorated with wondrous figures, harpies, satyrs, horned geese and\r\nbridled hares, that men were incredulous, and doubted that precious\r\nambergris, musk and gems were to be found within. In his first\r\ncrudities, fyttes and tilts with thought, both knight and field are\r\ncovered with a cloth of gold so dazzling that the crystalline lenses of\r\nour common vision are in danger of dissolution, and we vainly hope for\r\npage or dame who will whisper to us the magic word that shall dispel\r\nthis scene of enchantment. Meanwhile, his sentences, like arrows, darken\r\nthat sun, himself, and we hasten with bits of smoked glass to view the\r\neclipse. Happily, we have chosen the right medium: the luminousness is\r\ndestroyed, but the opaqueness remains visible. Entrenched behind a\r\nmannerism so adroitly constructed as at once to invite and repel\r\ninvasion, Emerson hurls out axioms and establishes precedents that prove\r\nupon examination to be either admirably varnished editions of old truths\r\nor statements of new ones of questionable legitimacy. Turn over leaf by\r\nleaf these early essays, and doubts arise as to the validity of the\r\nauthor's claim to originality. Carlyle has led before these pompous\r\nparades of moral truths that your child recognizes in the nursery when\r\nhe makes war upon Johnny, who has knocked down his ten-pins. The law of\r\ncompensation and the existence of evil and consequent suffering are\r\nactual entities to him. And yet these men do not belong to the same\r\nschool. The resemblance is on the surface. Emerson dabbles delicately,\r\nyet, let it be conceded, energetically, with theories: his hands are\r\nnot the nervy, sinewy hands of the Viking of English literature; he\r\nlacks his keen discernment of life, his quick comprehension of the\r\nmutual relations of men and their times; he often wants his fine\r\nanalytical power. Carlyle sees in the life of a man his actions,\r\nassociations, aspirations, disappointments, successes, what deep\r\nprinciples swayed him, what noble or ignoble nature provided his\r\nimpulses, and wrought his manhood: Emerson tests him by the great\r\nproblems of the universe, as he understands them, and educes from their\r\napplication to certain circumstances the character of the man. The one\r\nis sagacious, argus-eyed; the other oracular, sibylline. And yet\r\nEmerson, perhaps unconsciously, through admiration of the liberal views\r\nand unquestioned bravery of his contemporary, adopted something like his\r\npeculiarities of style and domesticated foreign idioms, that yet, like\r\ntamed tigers, are not to be relied on in general society. As Carlyle was\r\nthe rhinoceros of English, Emerson aspired to be its hippopotamus,--both\r\npachyderms, and impenetrable to the bullets of criticism.\r\n\r\nWe have called Cousin an eclecticist. His Philosophy is a positive one\r\ncompared with that of Emerson. Here are scraps of Plato and Hegel, of\r\nPorphyry and Swedenborg, of Æschylus and De Stael. Like the _Lehrer zu\r\nSais_, 'he looks on the stars, and imitates their courses and positions\r\nin the sand.' In the obscurity that proves him great, for 'To be great\r\nis to be misunderstood,' (is this the true 'misery of greatness' of\r\nMilton?) it is hard to grasp his individuality. His haughty assertions\r\nmeet us at every turn. We no more dare to question them than so many\r\n'centaurs or sphinxes or pallid gorgons' in a nightmare. But he relieves\r\nour perplexity and gives us the key to that enigma himself. 'I unsettle\r\nall things. No facts to me are sacred, none are profane. I simply\r\nexperiment, an endless seeker, _with no past at my back_.' What is this\r\nbut another version of Brahma? 'Far or forgot to me is near.' It is a\r\nreflection of the Veda. 'I myself never was not, nor thou, nor all the\r\nprinces of the earth, nor shall we ever hereafter cease to be.' Spinoza,\r\nthe God-intoxicated man, never ventured on a declaration so bold. 'The\r\neternal wisdom of God, _Dei oeterna Sapientia_,' says he, more\r\nmodestly, 'is manifested in all things, but mostly in the human mind,\r\nand most of all in Jesus Christ.' Here then we find the individuality of\r\nEmerson, in his pure Pantheism, and, like the sword of Martin Antolinez,\r\nit illumines all the field. Now we understand the constant warfare, the\r\n'inevitable polarity,' in these pages. We forgive the occasional\r\ninconsistencies of a man who is at once, by his own confession, 'God in\r\nNature and a weed by the wall.' His weakness strives after infinite\r\npower. Conscious of a divinity within, he struggles to express it\r\nworthily; but ah! says Hermes Trismegistus,--'It is hard to conceive\r\nGod, but impossible to express him.' Freedom within chafes at the iron\r\nnecessity without, 'a necessity deep as the world,' all-controlling,\r\nimperial, which he acknowledges in the very depths of his being. But the\r\nnecessity of Emerson is a Hegelian element, such as every Aristophanic\r\ncomedy reveals. It is not the necessity of Fichte. 'I, with all that\r\nrelates to me, am imprisoned within the bonds of Necessity. I am one\r\nlink of her inflexible chain. A time was when I was not, so those have\r\nassured me who were before me, and, as I have no consciousness of this\r\ntime, I am constrained to believe their testimony.' This is the\r\nnecessity of mere existence, which bears no relation to the will of the\r\nman, not that inflexible destiny to which Emerson refers, that underlies\r\nhis continued being. The first does not oppose the 'instinct of an\r\nactivity free, independent,' which Emerson afterwards acknowledges. But\r\n'I am God in Nature,' he repeats. 'The simplest person who in his\r\nintegrity proclaims God, becomes God.' 'This thorough integrity of\r\npurpose,' writes Fichte, 'is itself the divine idea in its most common\r\nform, and no really _honest_ mind is without communion with God.' In\r\nEmerson the last height is reached. Brahm as Arjoon could do no more,\r\nno less. His eye roams over the universe and sees only manifestations of\r\nhimself: the rose of morning, the shining splendor of the sea, the\r\npurple of the distant mountains, are his dawn and noon and eve.\r\n\r\n  'Alas! what perils do environ\r\n  The man who meddles with--a siren!'\r\n\r\nThis may be Pantheism, but if it is not in accordance with the needs of\r\nthe ages, it is not the Pantheism of Giordano Bruno, it has little in\r\ncommon with Plato. The great idea, the latter tells us, in the\r\n_Republic_, 'the idea of the God, is perceived with difficulty, but can\r\nnot be perceived without concluding that in the visible world it\r\nproduces light, and the star whence the light directly comes, and in the\r\ninvisible world it directly produces Strength and Intelligence.'\r\nStrength and Intelligence; whose correlatives are Progress and\r\nHappiness. Are there among Emerson's earlier 'big-sounding sentences and\r\nwords of state,' any of which these are the legitimate fruit? Does the\r\nsoul of Infinite Love that beamed from Nazareth inform these pages with\r\nthe active, perfect, immortal spirit of truth? No. In these essays,\r\nEmerson is a royalist, an aristocrat: he aims for the centralization of\r\npower; he does not elevate the masses; he claims for himself, for all\r\nnature, ultra-refined and cultivated, to whom the Open Secret 'has been\r\ndiscovered, a separate and highly superior personality. 'The height, the\r\nduty of man is to be self-sustained, to need no gift, no foreign force.\r\nSociety is good when it does not violate me, but best when it is likest\r\nto solitude.' What an Apollo Belvidere the man would be, moulded by no\r\nsympathies, standing aloof from his race, and independent of it,\r\ndisdainful, magnificent, a palace of ice, untenable by the summer heat\r\nof Love. The true cosmopolite is the man of his age, even if he has\r\nknown no latitude but that of his birth, for he has won for himself the\r\nhighest individuality, and the greatest power of association with his\r\nfellow-man, and the laws that govern man in his efforts to secure these\r\nare the laws of the only true social science. Henry Carey says with\r\nreason, in Italy the highest individuality was found when the Campagna\r\nwas filled with cities. It is a narrow belief that the highest\r\ndevelopment of character demands solitude. Give to a young man, genial,\r\nimpulsive, and intelligent, only the companionship of forest, sea, and\r\nmountain, and the chances are, he will become morbid, unpractical, and\r\nselfish. But place him in the same position in the decline, or even in\r\nthe noon of life, when the different parts of his nature have become\r\nsubordinated to each other, by friction with diverse human organizations\r\nabout him, and he will carry a brave individuality among nature's gifts,\r\nbeing himself her noblest development. 'Men,' says Emerson, 'resemble\r\ntheir contemporaries even more than their progenitors. It is observed in\r\nold couples, or in persons who have been house-inmates for a course of\r\nyears, that they grow alike: if they should live long enough we should\r\nnot be able to know them apart. Nature abhors such complaisances, which\r\nthreaten to melt the world into a lump, and hastens to break up such\r\nmaudlin agglutinations.' But Darby and Joan in the chimney-corner are\r\nnot types of mankind at large.\r\n\r\n'Right ethics are central, and go from the soul outward. Gift is\r\ncontrary to the law of the universe. Serving others is serving myself. I\r\nmust absolve me to myself.' And what is myself? Let Fichte answer. 'I\r\naffirm that in what we call the knowledge or the contemplation of\r\nthings, it is always ourselves that we know or contemplate: in every\r\nsentiment of consciousness it is only modifications of ourselves that we\r\nfeel.' And again: 'The universe lives. From it arises a marvelous\r\nharmony that resounds deliciously in the very depths of my heart. I live\r\nin all that surrounds me. I recognize myself in every manifestation of\r\nNature, in the various forms of the beings about me, as a sunbeam that\r\nsparkles in the million dew-drops that reflect it.... Within me Nature\r\nis flesh, nerves, muscles; without, turf, plant, animal.'\r\n\r\nThus the semi-poetical Pantheism of the Bhagvat-Gita is reproduced,\r\nbeautiful, dreamy and mythical, but without the shadow of an addition.\r\nEmerson presents to us the primeval faith in its imposing majesty and\r\nterrible unity, but omits to mention its final winding up in the sacred\r\nMaya or Illusion of the Hindoos. Though his early essays are brilliant\r\nwith many noble thoughts, the principles he advocates in them are\r\nthoroughly unprogressive and unpractical. Plato is to him the\r\n'exhaustive generalizer,' beyond whom it is folly to aspire, and by\r\nwhose stature he measures the nations. Boëthius, Rabelais, Erasmus,\r\nBruno, are only brisk young men translating into the vernacular wittily\r\nhis good things. St. Augustine, Copernicus, Newton, Behmen, Swedenborg\r\nalso 'say after him.' Emerson either addresses men whose ignorance he\r\ngreatly exaggerates, or else the ideal men of some centuries hence. His\r\nmission is to the Past or the Future, not to the Present. His theories,\r\nfine and venerable, as they are as here expressed, will never save a\r\nsoul, and men are still convinced that one sharp, decisive action is\r\nworth a thousand fine strategic points on paper. Yet he won an enviable\r\nand wide reputation by these his early works. 'There is merit without\r\nelevation,' says La Rochefoucauld, 'but there is no elevation without\r\nsome merit.' Such we find him in his earlier essays, while he had as yet\r\nonly grasped at the Pantheistic wing of the Egyptian globe. In England,\r\nin 1848, four thousand people crowded Exeter Hall, to hear the champion\r\nof free thought from America. In Poland, men who knew him only by some\r\nfragments in a Polish review, considered him the thinker of the age. His\r\ncourage was the talisman that won him admiration, and his earnestness,\r\nvisible through the veil of arrogance and petty affectations, secured\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nIn _Representative Men_, the old Plato-worship illumined by\r\nSchelling--_Wissenschaften_--is the key-note, and _English Traits_ is\r\nthe record of impressions received during the _Sturm und Drang_, or\r\nrather 'cloud-compelling' days of the _Dial_ and _Essay_ developments. A\r\nvolume of _Poems_, published in 1856, recalls the old landmarks. If they\r\nare rich in thought, they are also luxuriant in labyrinthine sentences\r\nthat puzzle even the initiated in the Ziph language. A thought once\r\nextricated from a maze of inversion and entangled particles,\r\n\r\n                  'we are in pain\r\n  To think how to unthink that thought again.'\r\n\r\nAs a poet, Emerson is careless in versification. Like Friar John, of the\r\nFunnels, he does not rhyme in crimson. His imagination is too bold to be\r\nconfined by the petty limits of trochee or iambus. Consequently his\r\npictures, when he condescends to paint, present rather a mass of\r\nbrilliant coloring than the well-finished detail that we demand in a\r\nwork of art. We look in vain in his poems for that effort of identity\r\nbetween the conscious and the unconscious activities that Schelling\r\ncalls the sole privilege of genius. 'The infinite (or perfect) presented\r\nas the finite, is Beauty.' Yet the single poem 'Threnody' would\r\nestablish Emerson's title to a place among the guild of poets. It is\r\nclassically beautiful and faultless in mechanism. Its flow is that of a\r\nriver over sands of gold, its solemn monotone broken now and then by\r\n_staccato_ plaints, and the tender gold of its shining waters dimmed by\r\ndark shadows, as rock beneath or tree above assails the gentle stillness\r\nof its onward flow. Only that which comes from the heart goes again to\r\nthe heart. We find a new and delicious personality, a simple Greek\r\nnaturalness, in this exquisite dirge that scarcely owns the 'blasphemy\r\nof grief,' that are wanted in his sententious instructions and\r\nmetaphysical wanderings.\r\n\r\nWe open Emerson's latest work, the _Conduct of Life_, in a hopeful mood.\r\nSome mysterious sympathy, born from a natural faith in the progress of a\r\nmind that had already proved its power by a daring and successful\r\nonslaught upon old habits and associations, strengthened by a more\r\npractical philosophy that dawns in _English Traits_, and culminating in\r\nthe intense passion of yearning in the _Phrenody_, justifies an\r\nexpectation that is gloriously realized. To the vigilant thinker a\r\ndecade is worth more than aeons to his sleeping brother. The Emerson of\r\nto-day is not the Emerson of twenty or even ten years ago. Here is still\r\nthe true, epigrammatic style of his youth. He is as lavish of his\r\naphorisms, which, like the coins of Donatello, hang over our heads and\r\nare free to every passer-by. Still an antiquarian, like Charles\r\nKingsley, he peers among Etruscan vases, Greek ruins, Norse runes and\r\nancient Dantean Infernos and Escurials for the models of a new\r\nliterature, a new art, a new life. But an enlarged spirit is visible on\r\nevery page.\r\n\r\n      'The south wind is strengthened\r\n  With the wild, sweet vigor of pine.'\r\n\r\nWe breathe a new air, gaze at new landscapes; a new climate is around\r\nus. Take this book into the sultry midsummer, and its words summon the\r\nripe autumn with its fruits up from the west; read it by the light of\r\nthe blazing Yule log, and it will still recall the wild breezes and warm\r\nsuns of October. And it is this growing maturity of thought, this\r\nevident tendency to a grand realization, that prove the honesty and\r\ngreatness of the man. He has worked perseveringly at his problems,\r\ndisdaining to be aided by criticism or crushed by opposition. His power\r\nhas silently gathered its energies in the mines of Thought, dark but\r\nrich, striking shaft after shaft of vast promise. He is a gymnast\r\nstruggling now with the realities and possibilities of Life, and no\r\nlonger grappling with ignis-fatui in the marshes by the road. Now his\r\nhumor gleams genially in keen, swift comparisons: he sports with truths,\r\nlike a king tossing up his crown-jewels or Vishnu worlds in the\r\n'Cosmogony of Menu,' and he dares do this because they are no longer his\r\nmasters, because he has made them subservient to an end--the great end\r\nof the amelioration of his race.\r\n\r\nIt is this great element of sport that in its broadest development\r\nelevates man to the far heights of his nature. There all is serene.\r\n\r\n  'Sub pedibusque videt nubes et sidera Daphnis.'\r\n\r\nEven the Hindoos, those earliest _literati_ of the young earth, whose\r\neyes peered first into the intricate machinery of Being, and brought\r\ntherefrom strange and glowing and miraculous impressions of its\r\nmechanical appliances,--strong levers that men use now for\r\ncriticism,--recognized this element. Afar from the scene of their\r\nsorrow, in the lotos a-bloom on Vishnu's head, they beheld the primitive\r\nHumor, the laughter of infinite Strength springing from bar to bar in\r\nthe great gymnasium of life. Thus we read in the Cosmogony of Menu,--\r\n\r\n  'Numerous world-developments there are, creation and extermination;\r\n  _Sportively_ he produces either, the highest Creator for ever and ever.'\r\n\r\nAnd says the more orthodox Schlegel, 'Nature was in its origin naught\r\nelse than a beautiful image, a pure emanation, a wonderful creation, a\r\n_sport_ of omnipotent love.' And Schiller, whom an impregnable\r\naristocracy of soul shut out from the ranks of humorists, who rode in\r\nhis coupée, three feet above the level of the common stream of humanity,\r\nand never drifted with its tide, yet, with clear-eyed insight into the\r\npassions he did not share, acknowledged the _Spieltrieb_ as the highest\r\npossibility of man's nature. 'The last perfection of our faculties,' he\r\nsays, 'is, that their activity, without ceasing to be sure and earnest,\r\nbecomes _sport_.\r\n\r\nEmerson's humor is peculiar to himself. It is not the massive, exuberant\r\nplay of Jean Paul. He does not challenge the slow-riding moon to a\r\ncricket match, nor hurl the stars from their orbits in his mad game in\r\nthe skies. Neither has he the brusque but more solid geniality of\r\nLessing. Imagination fails him for the one, and a strong power of logic\r\nfor the other. But he tears the clouds of ignorance and prejudice that\r\nare beneath his feet into ribbons and sends them streaming through\r\nspace, filmy banners of blue and white, heavily charged with the\r\nelectricity of his enfranchised thought, and illumines the world with\r\nthe lightnings of their chance collision. His humor is rather latent\r\nthan striking. It does not gleam through showy words, the paraphernalia\r\nof a harlequinade, but peeps out from the homeliest phrases, and\r\nconvulses some simple law of our nature with laughter at its own\r\ngrotesqueness. Formerly, imprisoned as it was within unyielding limits,\r\nit was as imposing as a miniature Gothic cathedral in a dark cave, but\r\nnow the queen-rose of the architrave blows fresh and sweet in the sunny\r\nair. Step by step Emerson has traveled the great road worn by so many of\r\nold, passing from the 'ideal' to the real, from reverie to a cheerful\r\nawaking,--and the prophecy of genius is at last fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFor at last he has come out from the misty twilight of Transcendentalism\r\ninto the clear daylight of common sense. And surely it is not for us to\r\ndecry the bridge, or, if you please, the tunnel through which he has\r\ncrossed. He agitates the necessity and practicability of social reform,\r\nbut it must be through individual effort. Years ago he decided that\r\nsociety was in a low state, now he calls on all men to put their\r\nshoulders to the wheel and lift it out of the Slough of Despond, where\r\nit has been floundering to no purpose for so long. His investigations\r\nare aided by a keen shrewdness, that bespeaks the practical man, who\r\nknows where to find the vulnerable heel of circumstance, and aims at it\r\nhis swiftest arrows. In his essay on Wealth this sharp practical insight\r\nhardens every sentence. The sentimentalist, who believes, with Henri\r\nBlaze, that romance must be the issue of this marriage of Nature with\r\nReligion, betakes himself in consternation to his dainty, poetical\r\ndreams of a Utopia that shall arise, ready made, from the promising\r\nEast. The capitalist, who sneers at Philosophy, and would ignorantly\r\ncouple Faust with the Mysteries of Udolpho, or Andromeda with Jack the\r\nGiant-killer, rubs his hands gleefully over our author's nice\r\nappreciation of capital and the mysteries of its sudden fluctuations.\r\n'Every step of civil advancement makes a dollar worth more.' 'Political\r\nEconomy is as good a book wherein to read the life of man, and the\r\nascendency of laws over all private and hostile influences, as any Bible\r\nwhich has come down to us.' 'The right merchant is one who has the just\r\naverage of faculties we call _common sense_; a man of a strong affinity\r\nfor facts, who makes up his decision on what he has seen. He is\r\nthoroughly persuaded of the truths of arithmetic.... He knows that all\r\ngoes on the old road, pound for pound, cent for cent, for every effect a\r\nperfect cause, and that good luck is another name for tenacity of\r\npurpose.' 'The basis of political economy is non-interference.' The\r\nmerchant looks narrowly at his theory of compensation, and finds it\r\ntallies well with the result of his own after-dinner meditations,\r\nexpressed of mornings to doubting confreres. The philanthropist rejoices\r\nat the crushing of the shell of foppish indolence, the heralded downfall\r\nof the petty vanities, sprung, Heaven knows with what reason, from the\r\nloins of Norman robbers, of Huguenot refugees, of Puritans beggared and\r\nignorant, and centered in some wide-spreading genealogical tree, that a\r\nwhole family unite to cultivate into a banyan that may embrace the whole\r\nlittle world of their satellites with inflexible ligatures. Thus 'the\r\ndoctrine of the snake' is to go out, and good men see that the sinews of\r\nsociety are to be strengthened.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to observe, in that first chapter on Fate, how\r\nadmirably Emerson provides for the exercise of a free activity in every\r\nman. 'Every spirit makes its house, but afterward the house confines the\r\nspirit.' This leaves no room for the coward, who declines to work out\r\nhis salvation, even with fear and trembling. It summons all men to clear\r\naway the brush and dry leaves of a perverted fatalism,\r\n\r\n  'To make the absolute best of what God made,'\r\n\r\nto sharpen every faculty, expand every capacity, and bow only to the\r\nEternal.\r\n\r\n  Æterna æternus tribuit, mortalia confert\r\n  Mortalis; divina Deus, peritura caducus.'\r\n\r\nHere is the choice, eternal or mortal, divine or perishable. This drives\r\nmen to seek their Paradise in Culture. Well, they find in it a Beulah,\r\nand beyond rolls the Jordan of the soul. Men have made a dwarfed\r\nProvidence to suit their dwarfed aims, an amorphous Deity, whose\r\nattributes are imperfect, disproportioned. But yesterday I heard a\r\nFrenchman, who has no acquaintance with our literature and never heard\r\nof Emerson, say, 'God, with the multitude, is no more than a feeble old\r\nman, whose whims and whose age we must respect. What is to become of his\r\nhigh claims upon creatures who are to work out an infinite purpose? _Il\r\nfaut honorer la vieillesse?_ Emerson had anticipated this with his\r\n'pistareen Providence, dressed in the clean shirt and white neckcloth of\r\na student of divinity;' yet it proves that minds are arriving by widely\r\ndiverging paths at the same truths.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing ideal or vague in the vigorous efforts he makes in this\r\nvolume to rise to political economy and to set forth the practical\r\naction of capital and industry on life. He says no longer, 'To me\r\ncommerce is of trivial import,' but endorses Henry Carey's theory of\r\nwealth, and acknowledges unreservedly, in its broadest sense, the\r\nuniversal domination of Law. Statistics bourgeon into prophecies under\r\nhis pen: he does not disdain their significance, but rather aids their\r\ninfluence with all the power which his spasmodic style has given in\r\ndrawing our grotesque-loving public to him. We suspect Buckle, and feel\r\na cheerful sense of Bacon and Comte. In his plea for socialism, for\r\neducation, we see the dawn of the ultimate triumph and dignity of labor.\r\n'We shall one day,' he says, 'supersede Politics by Education.' Pause\r\nwell here, you who grope forward into the dark future with misgiving and\r\nfaithless hearts. This is not the chimerical delusion of a\r\ntranscendental philosophy, this death-knell to the Slavery of Ignorance\r\nand Vice. Recognize in it the wide generosity that says with Leczinsky,\r\n_'Je ne connais d'avarice permise que celle du temps_.' Here is wealth\r\nfor want, industry for indolence, distinction for degradation, virtue\r\nfor vice. It beams clear as the red of morning. Hear it in the whistle\r\nof the engine, the roar of the loom, the plowing of the steam-ship\r\nthrough battling waves, the tick of the telegraph, the whirr of the mill\r\nwheel, the click of the sewing machine; and he who doubts still may\r\nlisten to the voice of cannon, the whistling of lances and the clash of\r\nswords, and catch the notes of the same chant with a sterner chorus.\r\nHear even the idealist Schelling awaiting that broader freedom than any\r\nwe have yet known:--\r\n\r\n'The third period in history will be that when that which in preceding\r\nperiods appeared as Destiny or Nature, shall develop and manifest itself\r\nas Providence. Thus what seems to us as the work of Destiny or Nature is\r\nalready the beginning of a Providence, which reveals itself but\r\nimperfectly. When we shall look for the birth of this period, man can\r\nnot say, but know that when it is, _God will be_.'\r\n\r\nAnd Emerson takes up the strain with words of fire:--\r\n\r\n'If Love, red Love, with tears and joy; if Want, with his scourge; if\r\nWar, with his cannonade; if Christianity, with its charity; if Trade,\r\nwith its money; if Art, with its portfolios; if Science, with her\r\ntelegraphs through the deeps of space and time, can set man's dull\r\nnerves throbbing, and, by loud taps on the tough chrysalis, can break\r\nits walls and let the new creature emerge erect and free,--make way and\r\nsing paean! The age of the quadruped is to go out--the age of the brain\r\nand the heart is to come in. The time will come when the evil forms we\r\nhave known can no more be organized. Man's culture can spare nothing,\r\nwants all the material. He is to convert all impediments into\r\ninstruments, all enemies into power. The formidable mischief will only\r\nmake the more useful slave. And if one shall read the future of the race\r\nhinted in the organic effort of Nature to mount and meliorate, and the\r\ncorresponding impulse to the Better in the human being, we shall dare\r\naffirm that there is nothing he will not overcome and convert, until at\r\nlast culture shall absorb the chaos and gehenna. He will convert the\r\nFuries into Muses, and the hells into benefit.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPHINX AND OEDIPUS.\r\n\r\n  Why poets should sing of this WAR\r\n    In rapturous anthems of praise,\r\n  I know not. Its meanings so jar,\r\n    Its purpose hath so many ways,\r\n  The SPHINX never readeth the whole.\r\n  'Tis a riddle propounded to me\r\n    That I am unskillful to tell.\r\n  The Sphinx by the way-side, I see,\r\n    Is watching (I know her so well)\r\n  To mangle us, body and soul.\r\n\r\n  Is it 'Freedom, that Bondage may live,'\r\n    Which cheers on the North to the fray?\r\n  Is it 'Slavery more Freedom to give,'\r\n    That slogans the Southern foray?\r\n  She asks, and awaits your reply:\r\n  Now answer, ye _marshal_-bred bands\r\n    Whose business is murder and blood;\r\n  Ye priests with incarnadined hands;\r\n    Ye peace-men who 'fight for the good;'\r\n  Now solve her this riddle or die!\r\n\r\n  'Our Flag,' the conservative says,\r\n    'Waves over the land of the free;'\r\n  God save us!--I think many ways,\r\n    But still 'tis a riddle to me,\r\n  Whose mystery is hid from the eye;\r\n  But Oedipus, showing the souls\r\n    All fettered, imbruted and blained,\r\n  Who point where its blazonry rolls,\r\n    And wail the sad plaint of the chained,--\r\n  Asserts, 'There is, somewhere, a lie.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTRESS WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been sent by my New York employers to superintend a branch of\r\ntheir business in a southern city. On the evening of a brilliant\r\nSabbath, as I walked musingly through the cemetery, where thousands of\r\nthe city's dead had found a calm and sequestered resting place, my\r\nattention was drawn to a monumental structure, the character and\r\nsymbolism of which defied my comprehension. On a grassy mound, in a\r\ngrove of oak trees, almost concealing it from observation, rose a\r\nmausoleum of dark stone, which at the first glance I conjectured to\r\nrepresent a Druidical temple. At the four corners were the carved\r\nresemblances of oak trees, the trunks forming columns for the structure,\r\nand the limbs branching out, intertwining above into a graceful\r\nnet-work. The spaces between the trunks--forming the four sides of the\r\nedifice--were simply plain, deep-set slabs. The design could not be\r\nmistaken. It was that of an oak grove inclosing a tomb. But whose, and\r\nwhy this singular design? There was no inscription to afford an\r\nexplanation. Another view added to the mystery. Standing in the middle\r\nof one of the sides, underneath the arch formed by the branching limbs,\r\nwas an exquisite female figure of white marble. One foot and the body\r\nadvanced, one hand grasping her robe, the other extended pointing into\r\nthe distance, her head turned to one side, the lips parted as if\r\nspeaking, the countenance expressive of the enthusiasm of love combined\r\nwith impetuous resolution, an attire of the most perfect simplicity,\r\nsimilar to that worn by Roman maidens, and with a plain bandeau around\r\nthe head,--the whole presented a figure of perfect symmetry and\r\nlife-like impassioned earnestness, as beautiful as it was\r\nunintelligible. I sought through all my recollections of ancient and\r\nmodern impersonations--of mythology, history, Scripture, and poetry--but\r\ncould find nothing to furnish a solution. The structure and the figure\r\nsurpassed even conjecture. Velleda, and Lot's wife, according to an old\r\npicture in the catechism, were the only resemblances I could recall, but\r\nthe surroundings evidently did not suit the types.\r\n\r\nWhile in my embarrassment, I became dimly conscious of seeing an elderly\r\nman coming towards me from behind the structure, but should have\r\nreceived no distinct impression of his presence had he not approached\r\nthe gate of the inclosure upon which I chanced to be leaning, and mildly\r\nrequested my permission to pass. Recalled to myself, I saw by a hasty\r\nglance that the person before me was a man apparently some sixty years\r\nof age, to whom time had imparted only a 'richness' of appearance,\r\nexhibiting the gentleman at every point, and with an aspect of the most\r\nprofound grief, tempered with resignation, benevolence, and urbanity.\r\nHaving politely assisted his egress, he passed onward with a graceful\r\ngesture of acknowledgment. He had taken but a few steps, when the\r\nthought occurred to me that he must have come from within the perplexing\r\nstructure by some secret door, and that he could unravel its mystery. I\r\nwas impelled to follow him, and proceeded hastily to do so, when the\r\nindelicacy of my intrusion on one evidently connected with the grief\r\nwhich the monument was designed to commemorate, flashed upon me, and I\r\nsuddenly paused. He probably observed my rapid footsteps and their\r\npause, for he turned toward me, when in a confused manner I stammered\r\nforth an apology, which, undesignedly on my part, involved a statement\r\nof the contradictory motives which had influenced me. With the most\r\nquiet and prepossessing demeanor he questioned me if I were a stranger\r\nvisiting the city, and in reply I gave him all the necessary particulars\r\nconcerning myself,--that my name was Waters, that I was employed by the\r\nfirm of Brown, Urthers & Co., managing their branch business. A\r\nconversation ensued, which elicited the fact that the gentleman had\r\nbeen acquainted with my father a score of years before. The latter,\r\nwhose head lies on his last pillow, was then a clerk in the New York\r\nhouse of Sampson, Bell & Co. The gentleman before me was Mr. Bell, who\r\nduring the existence of the house had been first a clerk, and\r\nsubsequently the partner who conducted their branch business at the city\r\nof my own present residence.\r\n\r\nWith this preliminary acquaintance, he kindly took my arm, and, leading\r\nme back to the monument, informed me, in a manner entirely free from any\r\npoignancy, or from that lionizing of costly memorials to departed\r\nfriends so often indulged in, that it was erected to the memory of his\r\nwife; that she had formerly been an actress of celebrity, attaining\r\npeculiar distinction by her representation of the character of Imogen,\r\nin Shakespeare's Cymbeline; and that the marble figure portrayed her at\r\nthe utterance of the words--\r\n\r\n  'Oh for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?\r\n  He is at Milford Haven. Read and tell me\r\n  How far 'tis thither ... Say, and speak quick,\r\n  How far it is\r\n  To this same blessed Milford;'[5]\r\n\r\nand that the architecture of the tomb was intended to correspond with\r\nthe period at which the incidents of the drama transpired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Bell's ordinary life was one neither of seclusion nor of widely\r\nextended social courtesies; but of active benevolence and cheerful\r\nretirement, disfigured neither by ostentatious philanthropy nor studied\r\nrecluseness. A son and daughter who had hardly passed the confines of\r\njuvenility, with the necessary attendants, formed his household. For the\r\nrest, he lived apparently as a gentleman of taste and wealth might be\r\nsupposed to do.\r\n\r\nIn this household I gradually acquired an intimacy. This was partially\r\nowing to the circumstance that I had solaced the many lonely hours of my\r\nbachelorhood in acquiring by memory and rehearsing many scraps of\r\npoetry. Mr. Bell's favorite method of passing the evening was in\r\nteaching his children to read and declaim poetry with dramatic\r\nexpression, and in this delightful occupation I was an acceptable\r\nassistant. Many were the domestic dramas which we produced,--pieces of\r\nour own invention,--in addition to our readings from the poets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrederick and Clara were to pass a year or two in schools at the North,\r\nand thither Mr. B. removed. The first winter of their absence, I\r\nreceived a letter from him relating that Clara had succumbed to the\r\nrigor of a northern climate. Soon came the father and brother with the\r\ncorpse of their darling, which was placed within the cemetery mausoleum.\r\nInto this I entered for the first time, but the interior differed in no\r\nrespect from others. Within its walls the mother and daughter were left\r\ntogether. In less than a week it was again opened, to receive the son.\r\nHe had been drowned while attempting the rescue of a companion.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise at the time, the desolate father exhibited no grief.\r\nThere was in his demeanor an appearance of satisfaction that their\r\nremoval had preceded his own,--that he would leave none of his heart's\r\ntreasures behind him, but be enabled to claim them all in the future\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe days lengthened and shortened through three years, in which the\r\nroutine of my life was varied by no incident. With Mr. Bell my relations\r\ncontinued the same. At all times he spoke cheerfully of the past and the\r\nfuture, frequently giving utterance to the feelings above attributed to\r\nhim. In one of these conversations I ventured to inquire concerning his\r\nwife. His whole countenance was irradiated. It seemed that some bright\r\nand glorious recollection of her had been recalled. The fancy impressed\r\nitself on me that he had a visible consciousness of her presence. The\r\nanimation subsided into a quiet self-communing, and he soon proceeded to\r\nrelate the history of her whose marble similitude had so excited my\r\nwonder and admiration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is nearly thirty years since I came from a New England country house\r\nto this city, as a clerk in the branch house of Sampson Brothers. I was\r\nthen a raw youth; but my New England training had given me the serious\r\nand money-seeking characteristics of that part of our country. For ten\r\nyears I applied myself exclusively to the details of business, having\r\nbut few associates, devoting my leisure to self-improvement, and\r\nsteadily accumulating a competency. On the death of a member of the firm\r\nI took his place. Five years passed, and I had attained a fortune. Some\r\nfriends from the North called upon me in their travels, and during the\r\nweek of their visit, I participated in more gaieties than had been\r\ncomprised in my whole previous life. One evening it was proposed to\r\nvisit the theatre. Into a place of dramatic representation I had never\r\nbefore entered, and the enchantment of all its accessories was\r\nirresistible. But when the heroine of the evening appeared, I was\r\ndeprived of every faculty except that of the most absorbing adoration.\r\nWhat was the drama enacted mattered not,--I had no perception of it, nor\r\nof anything except the person who had fascinated me. Tall in figure,\r\ncommanding in gesture, scarcely developed into the full wealth of\r\nwomanhood, with an eye of piercing blackness, yet changing with every\r\ngradation of passion, profuse black tresses, and a voice whose\r\nintonations swayed the audience to every mood of feeling, SHE for the\r\nfirst time appeared to me.\r\n\r\nWell, I had passed my _premiére jeunesse_, and had arrived at that age\r\nwhen a passion, once called into active life, becomes unappeasable. I\r\nneed not particularize the effects upon me of my first experience of\r\nlove. For weeks and months I had no desire, no ability to do anything\r\nelse than frequent the theatre. My want of acquaintance with all the\r\npeculiar circumstances connected with actors and actresses almost\r\nmaddened me; for I knew of no method by which I might ever be able to\r\nexchange a word with her who had become to me more than an idol to a\r\ndevotee, or the dream of fame to a poet. I sickened. To the physician\r\ncalled in attendance, after much shrewd questioning on his part, I\r\nrevealed my secret. With a jocose laugh he left me, but in a half-hour\r\nreturned, accompanied by a somewhat vulgar-looking female, whom he\r\nintroduced as the mother of Evelyn Afton--the name of her for whom my\r\nlife was wasting and my soul pining.\r\n\r\nThe mother was the widow of an actor, and Evelyn her only daughter, who\r\nhad been bred for the stage, and her beauty and ability having secured\r\nsuccess, she had been enabled to attain all the accomplishments of\r\ncultivated womanhood.\r\n\r\nIf anything could have disenchanted me, the manner of the mother would\r\ncertainly have had such an effect. She regarded my passion as simply a\r\nbusiness affair. She would present me to her daughter that day, and I\r\nmight contract an engagement, if I would make certain liberal allowances\r\nand settlements. But a recurrence to these matters creates disgust. It\r\nis sufficient to say, that I surpassed in my provisions all the demands\r\nof the mother's avarice, and in a few months Evelyn and I were married.\r\n\r\nThere was on the part of my beautiful bride an inexplicable\r\nexpression,--a demeanor in which cold and haughty reserve blended\r\nstrangely with an utter carelessness, and occasional rapidly checked\r\nelectric ebullitions of passion to the lip and eye, but never reaching\r\nwords, followed by a passive yet proud languor. I was too happy to\r\nobserve or speculate. I received merely the impression, but was too much\r\noccupied in arranging for my wedded life, too much absorbed in the\r\nfeeling of bliss, to analyze it. I believed in her love,--that was\r\nsufficient for me. In after years I resolved the impression into its\r\nprismatic elements, and thus it is I am able to delineate them.\r\n\r\nTime passed. The extravagance of my first raptures gradually subsided\r\ninto a more settled but not less complete happiness. In all her\r\nattentions to myself my wife was perfect. In society she was supremely\r\nbrilliant and fascinating; in private her demeanor preserved the\r\ncharacteristics of which I have spoken. I accepted it as her natural\r\nmanner, and did not give it further thought. My son Frederick was born,\r\nand for a short time, under the influence of maternal impulses, my wife\r\nexhibited animation and emotions which I had not before\r\nwitnessed,--soon, however, relapsing into her previous demeanor. The\r\nsame contrasts--less strongly marked--occurred upon the birth of my\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturning one evening from business, at the usual dinner hour, I\r\nvisited, before entering my residence, as was frequently my custom, the\r\nstables, and inquired, in passing, of the coachman--a favorite negro--if\r\nhe had driven his mistress out that afternoon. He replied,--\r\n\r\n'No, massa; Missers' brudder on here; been wid her dese two hours.'\r\n\r\nThe answer created much surprise, as I had not been informed that my\r\nwife had any relatives. A moment's reflection, however, on some of the\r\npeculiar connections of theatrical life, led me to believe that such a\r\nperson might be in existence, who, for some unpleasant reasons, had not\r\nbeen recognized. Respecting my wife's secret, I passed on without\r\nfurther inquiry; and, to avoid an interview with the visitor, ascended a\r\nstaircase into a conservatory connected with the upper apartments,\r\nintending to remain there until he had departed. As I entered the\r\nconservatory I was startled by the sound of voices, which proceeded from\r\nthe adjoining apartment,--my wife's _boudoir_,--and was transfixed at\r\nbeholding through the shrubbery, in the dim light of the room, my wife\r\nsitting upon a sofa, exhibiting traces of powerful but suppressed\r\nemotion, such as I had never seen in her, and partly kneeling, partly\r\nreclining at her side, a young man, apparently in the most violent and\r\npassionate entreaty.\r\n\r\n'O, Evelyn! Evelyn!' he said, 'will you bid me leave you thus? Will\r\nyou have no pity? For years I toiled at my art, poor and desolate,\r\nin a foreign land, sustained only by the hope of achieving\r\nsuccess--fame--fortune--to lay them before you;--your love gifting me\r\nwith all my ideal life--the hope of winning you the only incentive of my\r\nlabor. When I heard of your marriage, I dashed away my chisels, with an\r\noath never to resume them. In mad desperation, I destroyed the works of\r\nyears. But I have lived on in solitude and wretchedness, unvisited even\r\nby the imaginations which once made life glorious. Now I have come to\r\nclaim you--to take you from him who robbed me. Such a marriage as yours\r\nis not valid before just heaven. Renounce your contract. Fly with me to\r\nItaly,--let the world say what it will. With you at my side I can create\r\nworks that will compel homage; knowing our own purity, we can laugh at\r\nits scorn, and, contented with each other, despise both its friendship\r\nand its enmity.'\r\n\r\n'Stop, Frank!' she replied, 'and leave me. Do not prolong this agony.\r\nWhat you wish is, it must be, impossible. It is not for myself that I\r\ndeny it. God knows I could brave any thing for you. But to yield your\r\nrequest would only aid your ruin. No, no, Frank; you are mad!'\r\n\r\n'If I am not, I soon shall be!' he murmured bitterly.\r\n\r\n'I shall fulfill my contract to the letter,' she continued; 'or, rather,\r\nthat which was made for me. I consented to be the sacrifice, and I will\r\naccept the fire and the knife resolutely. But you--you--should I link\r\nmyself to your fate, I should draw you to perdition. Even in the air of\r\nItaly, my presence would be poison to you. I speak not of guilt. But my\r\nconnection--a perjured wife--would debar you from the companionship of\r\nall that is noble and good and beautiful. I am but a woman--one woman.\r\nCould I have been placed at your side, I might have assisted your\r\nconceptions and stimulated your aspirations. But now--_now_--it can not\r\nbe. Go--seek some other. There are many worthy of your choice. You can\r\nfind them. If not, live for your art, Frank, and forget me.'\r\n\r\n'My art!' he replied, with passionate bitterness; 'curses on it! Aye, I\r\ncan almost curse the Heaven which gifted me with \"ideality.\" What is it,\r\nbut unsatisfied mockery of longing?--the execution always failing to\r\nmeet the promise of the conception. My art! What can the cold marble be\r\nto me, when no longer animated by the soul with which my hope of your\r\npresence infused it? My art! Would to God that a divine flash of genius\r\nwould impel me to wield the chisel but for one short month, and then\r\nthat I might expire by the side of my creation!'\r\n\r\n'No, no, Frank,' she interposed; 'you will live long, become renowned,\r\nand create not one, but many works for fame; and I shall read of your\r\nsuccesses and rejoice in them. More than that, I shall be present with\r\nyou always in spirit and sympathy. Think of that, Frank. Make me your\r\nideal still, if you will. This will be exquisite satisfaction to me. Let\r\nme think that I am always inspiring you. Work for me, Frank.'\r\n\r\nThe young man buried his face in the sofa and sobbed passionately. My\r\nwife bent over, and, unknown to him, unless he felt her breath, gently\r\nkissed the curls of his hair. 'Come,' she said, 'now you must be gone.\r\nNeither of us can endure this longer. Go--go. Do not give me a word or a\r\nlook. You would only rend my heart, without killing me.'\r\n\r\nPresently he rose, and, with an effort at self-control, walked towards\r\nthe door, but stopped and faltered forth, 'Must this be? Is this then\r\nour last farewell?'\r\n\r\nShe merely waved her hand, hiding her face.\r\n\r\nThe young man sprang to her side, fell upon his knees, grasped her hand,\r\nand covered it with kisses, then rushed to the door and was gone.\r\n\r\nMy wife flung herself upon the sofa and burst forth into a flood of\r\ntears. Never before had I beheld her weeping.\r\n\r\nDuring this interview I stood like a statue. It seemed to me that I had\r\nlived an age,--such a life as those may be supposed to have, who, as\r\nrelated in Eastern tales, are transformed to stone for a century,\r\nretaining their consciousness. A revolution had gone through its entire\r\nprogress in me. For the first time did I understand how selfish had been\r\nmy adoration of my wife,--how I had merely purchased her of her scheming\r\nand avaricious mother,--how I had wronged her and one who loved\r\nher,--how incompatible with her youth and brilliancy were my maturity\r\nand unpoetic nature. Her conduct since our marriage was now fully\r\nexplained. My love for her was immeasurably increased, but I loathed\r\nmyself. I had but one thought, how reparation could best be made. I\r\nswear before Heaven, that could it have been possible without staining\r\nher name, I would have torn her from my heart, and given her to the one\r\nwho rightfully claimed her from me. This was impossible. Only by guilt\r\nor vulgar disgrace could she become his. Then the question took\r\npossession of me, 'How shall I win her love?--how shall I win her love?'\r\nThis repeated itself again and again, with a distinct and fearful\r\niteration, as if a demon were whispering it in my ear. A thousand mad\r\nthoughts took possession of me, and suicide thrust itself on me. For a\r\nfew moments,--though it seemed an age of experience,--I was insane. The\r\nblow had dispossessed my reason. Dimly, as in a drunken man, however,\r\nstill remained the ordinary instincts, and that perception, which, like\r\nthe muscles of respiration, keeps ever at work, let the mind be filled\r\nas it may with thoughts and purposes that seem entirely to engross and\r\nabsorb it. I crept silently from the conservatory, and passing out into\r\nthe street, entered the house at the front. Dinner was soon served, as\r\nusual, and my wife took her seat, with her customary manner. I, too, was\r\nconfident, exhibited no variation from mine. Her self-possession was\r\nthe result of control, mine of mere numbness. The machinery of life was\r\ntemporarily continuing its regular motion without any supervision.\r\n\r\nThis benumbed condition continued through a large portion of a sleepless\r\nnight. The unintermitted repetition of the query, 'How shall I win her\r\nlove?' tortured me into an agony like that experienced in a nightmare\r\ndream. Slowly and gradually my reason began to work, and I methodically\r\ncommenced to elaborate a system by which to acquire what was now the\r\nchief object of my life,--my wife's _love_. I arose in the morning\r\ndetermined to obtain this, even should every other pursuit be\r\nrelinquished and every other desire sacrificed. My system was formed.\r\nLife thereafter was to be devoted to it.\r\n\r\nMy first object was to create a change in her feelings toward my\r\nrival;--not to destroy her love for him,--of the futility of such an\r\nattempt I was aware,--but to modify the cold, desperate, and resentful\r\nfeeling of disappointment she entertained; to superimpose upon her\r\nthwarted passion, which would continue to regard him as a hero of\r\nromance, another condition of feeling, that should bring him before her\r\nin a different aspect, and to rouse her listlessness by suggesting\r\nsomething to be done which should be connected with him,--the only\r\nincentive, I was assured, sufficiently powerful to stimulate her to\r\naction. I had a patient whom I intended to treat in the most delicate\r\nand scientific manner. I determined to appeal to her benevolence,--a\r\nfeeling which, though latent, always exists in a true woman. My\r\ndisconsolate hero of romance was to be brought down and made a mortal,\r\ncapable of receiving favors. Instead of being the object of love, he was\r\nto become one of charity.\r\n\r\n'My dear,' said I, one evening, with a suppressed yawn, as I was\r\nperusing a magazine, 'I have been reading a stupid account of the\r\npictures and statues, and so on, in Florence. These things are very\r\nfine, doubtless, to those who understand and appreciate them. My early\r\neducation in aesthetics was neglected; or rather the hard necessities of\r\nmy youth allowed me no opportunity to cultivate them. But it is a good\r\nthing to encourage art, and I have been thinking it might be well for us\r\nto have some paintings and statuary. If I attempt to select them I shall\r\nbe tricked and bamboozled into purchasing mere daubs and botches. Would\r\nit not be well to engage some person of judgment--perhaps an artist--to\r\ngo to Italy and make an investment for us? I know none such, but you\r\nhave been more associated with artists, and if you can secure one, I\r\nwill give him _carte blanche_. Will you please make some inquiries?'\r\n\r\nI had kept my eyes on the magazine, but felt that she was looking at me\r\nwith scrutinizing glances. Had she suspected my knowledge of her love,\r\nshe would probably--with some of that passion of which I had been a\r\nsecret witness--have declared the whole matter, and then, with scornful\r\nupbraidings of my hypocrisy, perhaps have left me forever. I was careful\r\nto avoid any such premature explosion, and with another yawn continued\r\ncarelessly turning the leaves of the magazine. Reassured, she replied\r\nthat she would undertake the business. With a hasty glance, through\r\napparently sleepy eyes, I saw that I had roused her,--that she was\r\nalready intent on planning occupation for Frank, and laying out for him\r\na course of success and honor, through the stimulus which would be\r\nimparted by the execution of a commission of her bestowal. Another\r\nfeeling I was delighted to see exhibited. She felt that she was now\r\nabout to render him some equivalent for his disappointment. Already was\r\nhe become to her less Frank the lover than Frank the artist, whose\r\nfortunes she was to assist. I will make you yet his lady-patroness,\r\nthought I. I foresaw that some of my rival's productions would grace my\r\napartments, in a year or two. But, better his imagination than his\r\nheart, said I to myself,--better the works of his chisel, which I and\r\nall the throng of the public can eulogize, than the secret, doating\r\npassion confined to the intense idolatry of one breast.\r\n\r\nAfter a few premonitory nods I retired.\r\n\r\nI did not trouble myself about the manner in which the commission was\r\nconveyed to Frank. Thither, however, it went, as I learned in after\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI well understood that to attempt rivaling Frank in matters cognate with\r\nhis own department of talent, would render me only as ridiculous as an\r\nold beau who seeks to gain favor with the girls by imitating with his\r\nrouge, hair dyes, and laced waistcoats, the freshness and symmetry of\r\nyouth. But I must endeavor to establish some common ground on which I\r\nand the magnificent creature at my side could meet and hold converse. I\r\nmust find it in literature. In a garret over my store I had a safe and\r\nsome papers conveyed, ostensibly for attention to private business. I\r\nkept my room securely locked. Thither, from time to time, I secretly\r\ncarried a library of English classics, and all works of the day which\r\nreceived public intention. I revived all my early recollections of\r\nliterature, and made myself acquainted with the lighter contemporaneous\r\nworks, which are the most prolific topics of conversation in society.\r\nUnder pretense of business I devoted every moment I could to my solitary\r\nchamber. Never did college student, cramming himself for examination,\r\nlabor more intently than I. I stored my mind not only with words, but\r\nideas. I committed to memory innumerable fine passages. Personally, I\r\nwas well repaid for my toil. Literature is always solacing, elevating,\r\nand ennobling. The Bedouin of the desert is less of a robber and\r\nmurderer while singing the songs of his national poets.\r\n\r\nMy acquisitions, however, were carefully hidden. They were for future\r\nuse. At present I continued to talk nothing that was beyond the scope of\r\nthe newspapers.\r\n\r\nThus some months passed. It was near the close of summer, and the\r\ngorgeous autumnal season was at hand. I designed to attempt something\r\nwhich would create a change in my wife's nature,--her acquired nature,\r\nto substitute some healthful exuberance for the weary listlessness which\r\nhad become habitual to her. The physical is the foundation of all other\r\ndepartments of humanity. With a physical system of glowing health,\r\nmental or emotional or moral disease is impossible; and the converse is\r\ntrue, that when these exist, the physical system must deteriorate. I\r\nmust then give a filip to my wife's physical vigor,--dissipate her\r\ndesperateness and her love in the same manner in which a good game of\r\nbilliards drives from a man the blues. I must remove all her morbidness.\r\nWhere could I go but to the great mother Nature? If physical enjoyment,\r\nin connection with an appreciative view of the beauties and glories\r\neverywhere spread before humanity, on the mountains, the plains, the\r\nvalleys, and the oceans, does not revive and restore, the case is\r\nhopeless. My wife was an excellent equestrian. Her theatrical experience\r\nhad familiarized her with firearms. She had a cultivated taste for\r\nscenery, and some degree of skill in delineating it. Far off, then, into\r\nthe prairies and the western mountains, into scenes away from the beaten\r\ntrack, where everything should be as dissimilar as possible from all\r\nprevious life, I determined to lead her.\r\n\r\nMy arrangements were quickly and quietly made,--my equipments secretly\r\ncompleted. On pretense of visiting business acquaintances, I requested\r\nmy wife to accompany me on a journey to St. Louis. With her usual\r\npassiveness, she consented. In a few days we were on our way. After our\r\narrival, we made trips into the interior. Gradually, I diverged from\r\ncivilization. Professing to find an unexpected charm in the novelty of\r\nthis, I led the way still onward. We traveled on horseback,--often amid\r\nsolitudes. I first astonished my wife by occasionally displaying on the\r\ngame my precision with the rifle. (I had spent scores of hours at a\r\nshooting gallery in St. Louis.) I persuaded her to try a few shots. (I\r\nhad provided a beautiful light rifle for her use.) Ambition to shoot\r\nwell soon possessed her. By degrees, our open-air life gave her blood a\r\nbound which no secret grief could counteract. The excitement of the\r\nchase on our fleet horses, the incidents of our hunting adventures, and\r\nthe novelty of our associations, created a glow of spirit which burst\r\nforth in unrestrained conversation, mirth, and song. Now, then, I began\r\nto display my literary acquisitions. During the long evenings in our\r\ntent, or the wigwam of an Indian, or the log cabin of a backwoods\r\nsettler, we alternated in reading aloud from an excellent collection of\r\nbooks I had prepared. Reading introduced topics of conversation, in\r\nwhich I employed all that I had in memory, and all that had been created\r\nin myself by the electric collision of great authors. Never did a\r\nprofessional wit more ingeniously produce as sudden coruscations the\r\n_bon mots_ tediously studied; never did a philosophical\r\nconversationalist use to more advantage the wisdom conned over in the\r\ncloset. I talked eloquently, profoundly. I rattled forth witticisms and\r\npoetical quotations. I amazed her. The man whom she thought incapable of\r\nany ideas beyond his ledger, and the stock market, and the cotton\r\nwarehouse, was revealed as a person of taste and reading. Instead of\r\nappearing to her merely an indifferent person, to whom her fate had been\r\nchained, and whom she regarded in somewhat the same manner as Prometheus\r\ndid his rock, I had become a pleasant companion,--a being of more\r\nvitality than she had perhaps ever met.\r\n\r\nStill, I had not excited the emotion of love. I did not expect it at\r\nthis stage of the treatment, but I observed its absence with a pang.\r\n\r\nFor woman's love is not a slowly extorted tribute to excellence, but a\r\nspontaneous bestowal. Unlike evil spirits, which, according to popular\r\nsuperstition, need urging over the threshold before they can enter and\r\npossess the hearthstone. Love leaps in unsolicited at any unguarded\r\naperture, and becomes master of the household.\r\n\r\nOnly genius could command her homage, and to this I could make no\r\npretension.\r\n\r\nLove is oftener a response to appreciation, than a concession granted\r\nupon a rational estimate of him who seeks it. She did not yet know that\r\nI appreciated her. The time for her to learn it had not come.\r\n\r\nThe casket of a woman's heart is oftener forced than opened with a key.\r\n\r\nLove had once entered my wife's soul, and, after accomplishing his\r\nmischief, left demons in possession. I could not exorcise--only charm\r\nthem. For the present,--perhaps for years,--I must be content with this.\r\nIn the distant future, which had a dim horizon of hope, I expected to\r\nmake some final stroke by which to expel them. What it should be, I\r\ncould scarcely anticipate. Necessarily, I foresaw, it must be like the\r\nhighwayman's challenge, 'Money or life.' After becoming endurable to\r\nher, in fact, inveigling her into unforeseen familiarity, I must\r\nsuddenly throw off the mask, and demand the love for which I had waited\r\nand plotted. Either she would surrender, or there would be a tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe denouement came in a way of which I had no prescience. You will\r\nlearn it in the due course of my narrative.\r\n\r\nBut she charmed me, fearfully, when she appeared, after a morning's\r\nchase, resplendent in the fullness of her healthful beauty, beaming with\r\nexcitement, her superb figure undulating gracefully to the restive\r\nmovements of her horse. I could have prostrated myself before her, in a\r\nwild worship of her beauty. She had that quality which is so rare in\r\nwoman, but so admirable where it exists,--entire fearlessness; for it is\r\na most absurd mistake to suppose that masculine _virtues_ can not\r\nco-exist in woman with the most lovable, feminine delicacy. Partly her\r\nunblenching courage was the product of a strong will in a splendid\r\nphysical organization; partly, alas! it arose from a disregard of life,\r\nwhich she felt was worthless.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as we turned our faces homeward, our Indian escort and\r\nbaggage having preceded us, we were riding quietly along, with no\r\nintention of hunting, but accidentally coming on a few buffaloes\r\nseparated from their herd, the temptation to attack them was too strong\r\nto be resisted. We both urged our horses in pursuit, and, overtaking\r\nthem, fired simultaneously at different animals. My wife's quarry--a\r\nstout bull--continued his flight, not being fatally wounded. Suddenly,\r\nsome of our Indians who had heard the shot, and started to return, came\r\ninto view over the brow of a hill, and the buffalo, thinking himself\r\nsurrounded, turned and rushed at my wife. She avoided the onset by a\r\nquick whirl of her horse. The buffalo gathered himself and returned to\r\nthe charge with a roar of rage. Not having reloaded my rifle, I spurred\r\nforward, and leaped my steed full upon his massy form. We all fell\r\ntogether, and when, after several seconds, I extricated myself, my wife\r\nwas standing on the buffalo's neck to prevent him from rising. I plunged\r\nmy knife into his chest, but in the mad struggle of death he partially\r\nrose, throwing her to the ground, while one of his horns entered her\r\nside. Never before, since I commenced my system, had I lost my studied\r\ncalmness. But the sight of her blood, dyeing her garments and the grass,\r\nmade me frantic. I tore away her vestments from the wound, pressed my\r\nlips in an agony to the gash, and then, hastily stanching the blood,\r\nbore her, nearly senseless as she was, in an embrace, the thrilling\r\nenergy of which can not be told, to a rivulet in the vicinity. Happily\r\nthe wound was but a lesion of the flesh, for which my surgery was\r\nsufficient, and by the aid of stimulants she revived, subsequently\r\nrecovering without injury.\r\n\r\nSince my fatal discovery in the conservatory, I had not before touched\r\nher person, except for such courtesies as any gentleman may render a\r\nlady of his acquaintance. Now, with my arms clasping her, my veins\r\nthrobbed as in a delirium. The tender light of her eyes, as she revived,\r\nresulting partially from weakness and partially from a natural\r\nthankfulness, moved me to the very point of prematurely throwing myself\r\nat her feet and disclosing all. By a great throe I controlled myself. As\r\nshe resumed her natural condition, I fell back into that most ordinary\r\nand common-place character,--a self-satisfied husband,--qualified\r\nsomewhat by sympathy and attention, of course, but without the least\r\ninfusion of sentiment.\r\n\r\nOh, if she had known of the volcano under this exterior! If she had\r\nknown how, at that moment, I could have exclaimed, 'Give me your love,\r\nor here let us die!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo, after various desultory wanderings, we returned home. Home! how I\r\ndreaded it, for I knew the power of association--the effect of\r\nlocalities and customary external habits on the feelings. You may take a\r\ncareworn, dyspeptic, melancholy man out for a week's excursion, and he\r\nwill show himself preëminent in all good fellowship. But as the familiar\r\nsights gradually open on him at returning, you may see the shadows\r\nflitting down upon his brow and entering his soul. How many good\r\nresolutions of change and reform--of breaking old associations and\r\nforming new ones--we make when absent from our usual haunts! How\r\nimpossible it becomes to realize them when we re-occupy the familiar\r\nplaces!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut so it was, we reached home. All my anticipations were realized. The\r\nold spirit, the old manner, were revived in my wife. At this time an\r\ninstallment of pictures and statues from Italy came to hand. I welcomed\r\nthem as angels of mercy. When I announced the arrival to my wife, a\r\nflush struggled to her cheek, and a radiance to her eye. 'Ha! you\r\nthink,' said I in my communings, 'that Frank is to be present with you\r\nin his works, and that through them you may be in his presence. So you\r\nshall, but they shall become only an annoyance and a weariness,--for\r\nthemselves and for him.'\r\n\r\nThe statues and pictures were brought to the house and unpacked. My wife\r\nwas almost tremulous with eagerness to behold them. I had taken care,\r\nhowever, to have a number of acquaintances present,--some of genuine\r\nartistic taste, some of only pretensions, and others utterly ignorant.\r\nAs the various works were displayed, my artistic friends, as in courtesy\r\nbound, and as their merit really deserved, duly eulogized them, and the\r\npraises were echoed by the rest. Finally we came to a box which\r\ncontained a label marked 'The statue of Hope Downcast.' 'Aha! master\r\nFrank,' thought I, 'so I have you at last.' I could see my wife\r\nquivering with the contest of feeling,--between her annoyance at the\r\npresence of visitors, and the necessity of controlling herself and\r\nuniting in their commendations.\r\n\r\n'Hope Downcast' was raised to the perpendicular, and proved to be a\r\nbeautiful life-size statue, representing a female figure standing on a\r\nrock, in a most dejected attitude, one foot unsandaled, her raiment\r\ntorn, her hair loose, the fillet which confined it lying parted at her\r\nfeet, the star upon the fillet deprived of some of its points, and the\r\nordinary emblem of Hope, the anchor, broken at her side. The\r\napplicability of the conception to the history of Frank and my wife, I\r\nreadily understood. My guests broke out into raptures, in which I\r\njoined, and, by continual appeals to my wife, constrained her to do the\r\nsame. I also took the opportunity of inquiring the name of the artist,\r\nand requested my wife to express to him the entire satisfaction he had\r\ngiven in the execution of his commission.\r\n\r\nThe ordeal closed, but was renewed and repeated day after day, till all\r\nthe poetry and romance connected with our artistic acquisitions was\r\nthoroughly destroyed in my wife's mind. They became, as I could easily\r\nobserve, positively odious to her, and, doubtless, could she have obeyed\r\nthe promptings of her feelings, she would have trampled on them, and\r\ncast them into the street.\r\n\r\nBut in this disappointment she became so forlorn, so passively\r\ndesperate, that my heart almost burst at beholding her.\r\n\r\nSince my discovery in the conservatory I had often used it for watching\r\nmy wife,--not of course with any miserable design of playing the spy\r\nupon, her,--but to observe her various moods, in order to adapt, my own\r\nconduct and the progress of my system to them. One night, after we had\r\nentertained a party of visitors, whom I had made instruments of torture\r\nto my wife by their common-place eulogies of Frank's contributions, I\r\nascended my perch in the conservatory. She was sitting in her apartment,\r\nher hands, listlessly clasped, resting on her knees, her form bowed with\r\nthe most profound dejection, coupled with that indescribable aspect of\r\ncold, desperate defiance which I have previously noticed, exhibited in\r\nher countenance and position. 'Oh! Frank, Frank!' she seemed to say,\r\n'would that I had forsaken all and fled to Italy with you. There, the\r\ncreations of your taste and genius would have afforded a solace. Here\r\nthey are but torments.'\r\n\r\n'You shall go to Italy, Evelyn, and have your fill of Frank's society,'\r\nsaid I in my imaginary comment. 'But not yet; the time has not yet\r\ncome.'\r\n\r\nHaving permitted her to learn the disappointment derived from the works\r\nof art associated with Frank's memory, I now brought into action a\r\nscheme for teaching her the pleasure which I could afford. Before our\r\nhunting expedition I had purchased a spacious and beautiful mansion, and\r\nengaged upholsterers from New York to decorate it, during our absence,\r\nin the most elegant style their taste could design. A large apartment\r\nhad been constructed by my order for the purpose of a private theatre.\r\n\r\nI informed Evelyn of my plan, and conveyed her to our destined\r\nresidence. She was not at first much moved, but after we had entered on\r\npossession, and she was thoroughly engaged in selecting an amateur\r\ncompany from our acquaintances and arranging for our forthcoming\r\nexhibitions, the old enthusiasm of her former profession revived, and\r\nshe appeared for the time transported back to the auspicious hours of\r\nher young triumphs. 'The School for Scandal' was chosen for our first\r\nperformance--I of course taking the part of Sir Peter, and she that of\r\nLady Teazle. I did not allow my feelings once to transcend the part,\r\nand in the conclusion looked completely the happy, good-natured,\r\nself-satisfied, old husband. Heaven! had her protestations, where the\r\nreconciliation occurred, been genuine, and not mere dramatic fiction!\r\nThe thought almost overpowered me. I could see the young bucks of the\r\ncity chuckling over my position, and evidently wishing they were in the\r\nplace of _that old fool_!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI need not relate the innumerable stratagems I devised to employ the\r\nattention and heart of my wife in pleasures emanating from myself. I was\r\ncontinually careful, however, to exhibit no sign of tender appreciation,\r\nbut allowed her to regard them as the mere ordinary gratification of my\r\nown whims and wishes. I had now been for about a year disconnected with\r\nmy business. I had encouraged Evelyn in every species of extravagance,\r\nand expended money lavishly in all methods. I was conscious of living\r\nfar beyond the ability of even my ample means, but there could not be an\r\nhesitation or halting. The city looked on me with wonder; some spoke of\r\nme as one whom fortune had crazed; others pitied me as the victim of an\r\nextravagant wife. My New York partners expostulated with me, and, when\r\nmy theatrical exhibition reached their ears, hinted at a dissolution.\r\nBut I was deaf to rumor and reproof.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe person who took the part of Joseph Surface, in our representation of\r\n'The School for Scandal,' was an unmarried gentleman of high standing,\r\nsocially and politically, of middle age, fine presence, and superior\r\nabilities. Under polished manners and captivating conversational powers,\r\nwere concealed persistent passions and a conscience of marble. Before\r\neven Evelyn suspected it, I was aware that he had resolved on subduing\r\nher to his own designs, for I seemed in all things relating to her to be\r\ngifted with preternatural intuitions.\r\n\r\nOur next representation was to be 'The Fatal Marriage,' in which the\r\nperson alluded to--whose name was Sefton--was to take the character of\r\nthe wooer.\r\n\r\nThe necessary consultations concerning the production of the piece\r\nbrought him frequently to my house, and both the excuse and the\r\nopportunities it gave were diligently improved.\r\n\r\nI had a premonition one evening that his intentions toward Evelyn were\r\nthen to take some decisive expression. I left my solitary study, of\r\nwhich I have before spoken, and, going home, entered the house softly,\r\nand directed my steps towards our theatrical apartment. My confidence in\r\nEvelyn was unbounded, but I wished to witness the apprehended collision.\r\nStealing behind the scenery, I saw Evelyn sitting on the stage, with\r\ncold and erect pride,--which was yet free from affectation,--and Sefton\r\nstanding before her, having evidently just concluded speaking.\r\n\r\n'So, sir,' she said, 'I have heard you without interruption. But the\r\ncharacter you rehearse is inappropriate. You forget that we are now\r\nconcerned with a piece representing the tribulations of a faithful wife,\r\nand not a comedy of the school of Charles the Second. I see that you are\r\nsincere; but sincerity renders a bad passion the more hateful. Now leave\r\nme. For your own contentment crush it. If this is impossible, conceal\r\nit. Should you ever again intimate it by even a glance, I will expel you\r\nfrom my society as I would a viper.'\r\n\r\n'Madam,' he gasped forth in suppressed rage, 'I understand you. You\r\nshall also understand me, if you now do not. I will reduce your haughty\r\npride. Of this be assured. You play well the _rôle_ of the faithful\r\nwife, but I will not do you the injustice of supposing that it is\r\nthrough any regard for him on whose behalf you assume it.'\r\n\r\nHe would have said more, but Evelyn sprang up, her eyes flashing, and,\r\nseizing a dagger which lay on a table among other 'properties,'\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n'Begone, sir, or you shall find me an actress who can perform a terrible\r\nreality.'\r\n\r\nShe advanced toward him, and he turned away, passing out slowly, cowed,\r\nbut not vanquished. I could see that he was determined to become her\r\nmaster, though it cost him all that he had invested in ambition, honor,\r\nand life.\r\n\r\nShe flung down the dagger, paused till he was out of the house, and then\r\nwent to her rooms. I emerged from my hiding-place, laughing and sobbing\r\nhysterically,--rejoicing over my glorious Evelyn, and bewailing that she\r\nwas not in truth mine.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after this scene, I found on several occasions, when\r\nreturning home late, that Evelyn was out. I never interfered with her\r\nfreedom, nor questioned her in regard to any of her proceedings; but,\r\nnevertheless, in all cases, as there was no concealment concerning them,\r\nI was, by the ordinary channels of social and domestic intercourse,\r\nacquainted with them. With regard to the absences alluded to, however, I\r\nwas at fault. They were not attributable to any of the engagements of\r\nsociety. It became, of course, requisite, as part of my system, to\r\ninvestigate the mystery. So, on a certain evening, after going out\r\napparently as usual, I watched the house, and, shortly after dusk, saw\r\nher emerge, clad in plain habiliments, and followed her at a distance\r\nthrough several secluded streets. She stopped at a very ordinary\r\ntenement in a remote quarter of the city, and remained till a late hour,\r\nwhen she returned home.\r\n\r\nI resolved quietly to take observations, and ascertain the motive for\r\nher visit. My intentions were precluded the next morning by the entrance\r\ninto my place of business of Mr. Sefton, who, after many complimentary\r\nand cordial expressions, requested a private conference; which being\r\ngranted, he said,--\r\n\r\n'My dear Mr. Bell, I wish to speak to you concerning a very delicate and\r\npainful matter. I am conscious of involving myself in an affair, which\r\nmay, perhaps, have unpleasant consequences for me, but my friendship and\r\nesteem for you will not permit me to remain quiet concerning a matter\r\nwhich is injurious to your honor.'\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to inform me that a certain actor, named Foster, who\r\nonce had a high reputation, but had become degraded through\r\ndissoluteness, recently came to him, apparently in abject poverty and\r\ndangerous illness, begging assistance and shelter; that he had placed\r\nFoster in a tenement, which he described (the same that I had seen my\r\nwife enter), and supplied his wants, but had reason to suppose that\r\nFoster was imposing on his charity, having learned from others that, so\r\nfar from being ill, he was sufficiently able to enjoy his appetites and\r\nlicentious desires. 'On going,' said Mr. Sefton, 'to reprimand and expel\r\nhim, he confessed to me that he had taken this method of covering an\r\nintrigue with a lady, and assured me he intended to repay all I had\r\nadvanced him. I became, also,' continued Mr. Sefton, 'a witness of an\r\ninterview with the lady, as she entered while I was there, and Foster,\r\nin the haste of the occasion, was obliged to conceal me in an adjoining\r\nroom. The lady, I was astonished to perceive, was Mrs. Bell. I then\r\nrecollected that Foster was formerly intimate with her, and that they\r\nperformed on the stage together. I have deemed it my duty to relate this\r\nastounding development to you.'\r\n\r\nI received Mr. Sefton's announcement in all seriousness, and thanked\r\nhim. What would he have me do? He replied that my own judgment must\r\ndictate, but that he supposed it would be best for all parties to remove\r\nquietly to another State and apply for a divorce. I promised to consider\r\nthe matter, and after many mutual compliments he departed.\r\n\r\n'What does this mean?' I mused. 'The supposition of an intrigue is\r\npreposterous. Probably Foster has merely deceived Evelyn as he did\r\nSefton, in order to obtain her bounty. But why make her visits so\r\nsecret? That is easily explained;--she does not wish to be connected\r\npublicly with any unhappy sequences of her former histrionic career. I\r\nwill have an interview with Foster before proceeding further.'\r\n\r\nI visited him that night, pushing into the house immediately after the\r\nblack female servant who opened the door, lest I should be refused\r\nadmittance. I found Foster in a half-intoxicated condition, seated\r\ncomfortably at a table, with a pipe in his hand, and liquor before him.\r\n\r\n'I am Mr. Bell,' said I, 'and had learned from my wife of your destitute\r\ncondition, which I came to relieve. But you appear in excellent\r\ncircumstances.'\r\n\r\nThrough his intoxication there was an evidence of confusion, as he\r\nstammered out,--\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir; much obliged to you. Take a seat--a seat. Good spell now.\r\nDoctor prescribes a little comfort, you know, old boy!'\r\n\r\n'A very kind doctor, I should judge, Mr. Foster, and I am glad to find\r\nyou in such a good condition. Suppose I take a glass with you?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly. Very happy--happy. Your health, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I hope, sir,' I said, 'that you will soon recover, after the attentions\r\nof my wife and Mr. Sefton.'\r\n\r\n'Sefton!' he exclaimed. 'Rascal! D--d rascal! sir.' He continued\r\nmurmuring in his throat, 'Rascal! D--d rascal!'\r\n\r\n'I'll take another glass,' said I. 'The liquor is very good--very good,\r\nsir. Who furnishes it?'\r\n\r\n'Liquor! Yes--very good! Sefton--yes, Sefton sent it. Rascal! D--d\r\nrascal!' (in a murmur, as before.)\r\n\r\n'Now, Foster,' said I, 'I am rich. There is a purse,--and pretty well\r\nfilled. I will give it to you, and others like it, if you will tell me\r\nwhy Sefton is a rascal, and how you happen to be connected with him.'\r\n\r\nHis eyes glistened with greediness, as I anticipated. He grasped the\r\npurse and thrust it into his pocket, then immediately pulled it out,\r\ntossed it on the table, leaned his head down on his arms and began to\r\nsob, all in the most maudlin manner.\r\n\r\nTO BE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SONG OF FREEDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Not now, my tongue, to legends old,\r\n  Or tender lays of sunny clime;\r\n  A sterner tale must now be told,\r\n  Deep thoughts must burn in warlike rhyme;\r\n  For Freedom, with a mighty throe,\r\n  Rouses from sleep to active life,\r\n  And loud her clarion trumpets blow,\r\n  To summon _men_ to join the strife.\r\n\r\n  The seed, which long ago was sown\r\n  By free New England's rock-bound rills,\r\n  At length, in noble vigor grown,\r\n  Casts branches o'er the Southern hills.\r\n  Far o'er the prairies of the West\r\n  Rings Freedom's thrilling battle-cry,\r\n  Re-echoed where each mountain crest\r\n  Lifts Maine's dark forests to the sky.\r\n\r\n  Go forth, ye warriors for the right!\r\n  Lift high the banner of the free!\r\n  Shine far into Oppression's night,\r\n  Bright oriflamme of Liberty!\r\n  For, God be praised, the lowering cloud\r\n  So long impending overhead,\r\n  Which nations thought our funeral shroud,\r\n  Shall prove our victory-robe instead.\r\n\r\n  O maiden, who with tender smile,\r\n  O wife, who with enslaving kiss,\r\n  Some dearly loved one would beguile\r\n  From duty in a field like this;\r\n  Conjure before thy tearful sight\r\n  The glories future years shall know,\r\n  Unclasp thine arms--in Freedom's fight,\r\n  Bid him be valiant,--bid him, 'go.'\r\n\r\n  Be with him both in camp, in field,\r\n  With tender thought and earnest prayer;\r\n  Think, those who Freedom's weapons wield,\r\n  God makes his own peculiar care.\r\n  And if he fall,--as chance he may,--\r\n  Rejoice the glorious boon is thine,\r\n  To lay thy heart-flowers of a day\r\n  On Freedom's grand, eternal shrine!\r\n\r\n  O warrior, nerve thy courage well!\r\n  For fierce and stern the strife will be,--\r\n  Oppression, Wrong, the powers of hell,\r\n  War against Right and Liberty.\r\n  Fight, for the victory must be thine;\r\n  No nobler strife the world has known\r\n  Since first the Saviour, all divine,\r\n  Brought life to man from God's high throne.\r\n\r\n  And ye, who sit in seats of power,\r\n  The instruments of God's high will,\r\n  Be ye not wanting in this hour\r\n  So big with future good or ill.\r\n  Fail not, for Freedom's car rolls on\r\n  Resistless in its glorious way;\r\n  Some shall to honor be upborne,\r\n  They who oppose be crushed to clay.\r\n\r\n  Hark! from the sunny Southern plains\r\n  There comes a sound still swelling on,\r\n  The clanking of a million chains,\r\n  The cry, the groan, the lash, the moan.\r\n\r\n  That sound for years has gone on high;\r\n  The hour of judgment comes apace,\r\n  The day of right and liberty,\r\n  Of freedom for the human race.\r\n\r\n  Speed, speed the day, O righteous God,\r\n  To break the fetters, dry the tears,\r\n  To raise the slave, so long downtrod,\r\n  Through the dark age of by-gone years!\r\n  Give but to us the sword of power,\r\n  To work thy ends, in thine own way,\r\n  To see the promise of the hour\r\n  Of this the world's most glorious day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACROSS THE CONTINENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the tense, absorbing excitement of our life-and-death-struggle for\r\nnational existence, events which in calmer times would quicken every\r\npulse, and arrest universal attention, pass all but unnoticed; as\r\nhistorians record that during the battle between Hannibal and the Romans\r\nby the Lake Thrasymene, the earth was shaken and upheaved by a great\r\nnatural convulsion, without attracting the observation of the fierce,\r\neager combatants; or, as Byron tersely phrases it,\r\n\r\n  'An earthquake rolled unheededly away,'\r\n\r\nbeing regarded, if regarded at all, as one of the incidents of the\r\ntremendous collision of Europe with Africa.\r\n\r\nWhen, early in March, 1844, John C. Fremont, with thirty or forty\r\nfollowers, astonished Captain Sutter by dropping down from the Sierra\r\nNevada upon his _ranche_ on the Sacramento, the old Switzer could not\r\nhave been more completely dumbfounded had he been told that his visitors\r\nhad just descended from the clouds, than he was by the truthful\r\nassurance that they were an exploring party, who had left the United\r\nStates only ten months before, and had since made their way across the\r\ncontinent. To pass the Sierra in winter had hitherto been deemed an\r\nimpossibility, and, indeed, the condition of Fremont's surviving beasts\r\nof burden--thirty-three out of the sixty-seven with which he\r\nstarted--proved the presumption not far out of the way. To traverse the\r\ncontinent at all, even in summer, on a line stretching due west from the\r\nHudson, the Delaware, or the Potomac, to the Pacific Ocean, was an\r\nunattempted feat, whereof the hardships, the dangers, were certain, and\r\nthe success exceedingly doubtful. A very few parties of daring\r\nadventurers had, during several of the six or eight preceding summers,\r\npushed up the Platte from the Missouri to the Rocky Mountains, followed\r\nthe Sweetwater from the point where the North Platte emerges from the\r\nheart of those mountains, running to the northward, and having thus\r\npassed through the great central chain of North America (for the\r\nSweetwater heads on the west side of the mountain range, and the South\r\nPass, through which it seeks the Platte, is a broad elevated gap,\r\nwherein the face of the country is but moderately rolling, and the trail\r\nbetter than almost any where else), turned abruptly to the north-west,\r\ncrossed the Green River source of the Colorado, which leads a hundred\r\nmiles farther north, and soon struck across a mountainous water-shed to\r\nthe Lewis or Snake branch of the Columbia, which they followed down to\r\nthe great river of the west, and thus reached the coveted shore of the\r\nPacific,--that Oregon which they had chosen as their future home, mainly\r\nbecause it was, of all possible Eldorados, the farthest and the least\r\naccessible. Trappers, hunters, and Indian traders, few in numbers, and\r\ngenerally men of desperate fortunes, who realized that\r\n\r\n  'The world was not their friend, nor the world's law,'\r\n\r\nhad, for several decades, penetrated every glen of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nand traced every affluent of the great river in quest of their\r\nrespective prey; but the wild, desolate region watered by the Colorado,\r\nthe Humboldt, or the streams that are lost in the Great Salt Lake, or\r\nsome smaller absorbent of the scanty waters of the Great Basin, had\r\nnever proved attractive to our borderers, and for excellent reasons. It\r\nis, as a whole, so arid, so sterile (though its valleys do not lack\r\nfertility wherever their latent capacities can be developed by\r\nirrigation), and its game is so scanty and worthless, that old Bridger\r\n(pioneer of settlers at the military post in northern Utah, now known as\r\nFort Bridger) was probably the only American who had made his home in\r\nthe Great Basin when Fremont's exploring party first pitched their tents\r\nby the border of Great Salt Lake, in September, 1843.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold in California, in the summer of 1847, closely\r\nfollowing the military occupation and conquest of that country by the\r\nUnited States, wrought a great and sudden revolution. Of the few\r\nAmericans in that region prior to 1846, probably nine tenths had rounded\r\nCape Horn to reach it, while the residue had made their way across\r\nMexico or the Isthmus of Darien. It was 'a far coy' at best, and very\r\ntedious as well as difficult of attainment. We have in mind an American\r\nof decided energy, who, starting from Illinois in May or June, 1840,\r\nwith a party of adventurers, mainly mounted, reached the mouth of the\r\nColumbia, overland, in December, and California, by water, in the course\r\nof the winter; and who, starting again for California, via Panama, in\r\nthe summer of 1847, was nine months in reaching his destination. But the\r\ntidings that the shining dross was being and to be picked up by the\r\nhandful on the tributaries of the Sacramento wrought like magic. Early\r\nin 1849, steam-ships were dispatched from New York for Chagres, at the\r\nmouth of the river of like name on the Isthmus of Darien, whence crowds\r\nof eager gold-seekers made their way across, as they best might, to\r\nPanama, being taken in small, worthless boats up the river, so far as\r\nits navigation was practicable,--say sixty miles,--and thence, mounted\r\non donkeys or mules, for the residue of the distance, which was perhaps\r\nhalf as far. Short as this portage was, it soon came to be regarded with\r\na terror by no means unjustified. The ascent of the rapid, shallow,\r\ntortuous stream was at once difficult and dangerous; the boats were of\r\nthe rudest construction; the boatmen little better than savages; rains\r\nfell incessantly for a good part of each year; the warm, moist, relaxing\r\nclimate bred fevers in the blood of a considerable percentage of those\r\nso suddenly and so utterly exposed to its malarious influences; while\r\nthe road from Cruces, at the head of navigation, being but a rugged\r\nbridle-path at best, was soon worn by incessant travel into the most\r\ndetestable compound of rock and mire that ever aggravated the miseries\r\nof human life. Arrived at quaint, dull old Panama, the early adventurers\r\nlong awaited with fierce impatience the steamers which were to have\r\nanticipated their coming, and been ready to speed them on their way; and\r\nmany were goaded into taking passage on sailing vessels, which were\r\nmonths in beating up to the Golden Gate against the gentle but\r\npersistent breezes from the west and north-west which mainly prevail on\r\nthat coast. Rarely has human endurance been put to severer tests than in\r\nthe earlier years of gold-seeking travel by the Isthmus route to\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe Panama Railroad--commenced in 1850, and finished in 1855, at a total\r\ncost of $7,500,000, for a length of forty-seven and a half miles--very\r\nconsiderably reduced the expense, whether in time or money, of the\r\nIsthmus transit, diminishing its miseries and perils in still greater\r\nproportion. It is one of the noblest achievements, whereof our\r\ncountrymen are fairly entitled to the full credit. A ship-canal or\r\nrailroad across the Isthmus had been proposed, and commended, and\r\nsurveyed for and estimated upon, by French, South American, and other\r\nofficials and engineers; but the execution of the work was left to our\r\ncountrymen, and not in vain. Contractor after contractor abandoned the\r\nundertaking in despair; hundreds, if not thousands, of laborers--Irish,\r\nChinese, and others--were sacrificed to the deadly miasma of the swamps\r\nand tropical jungle which thickly stud the route. But the work was at\r\nlast completed, and the railroad has now been some six years in constant\r\noperation, reducing the average length of the actual transit from a week\r\nto two hours, and its expense and peril to an inappreciable quantity. It\r\nis a cheering fact that the capitalists who invested their faith and\r\ntheir means in this beneficent enterprise have already had returned to\r\nthem in dividends the full amount of their outlay, and are now receiving\r\ntwenty per cent. per annum. Their road has shortened the average Isthmus\r\npassage to and from California by at least a full week, and immensely\r\ndiminished the danger of loss by robbery, accident, or exposure, beside\r\nbuilding up a large trade which but for it would have had no existence.\r\n\r\nYet the Isthmus route to California is only by comparison acceptable,\r\neven for passengers and goods, while for mails it was at best but\r\nendurable. It is nearly twice the length of the direct route from the\r\nAtlantic seaboard, while for the residents of the Evart Valley it is\r\nintolerably circuitous. A letter mailed at St. Paul for Astoria or\r\nOregon City, or at Omaha for Sacramento, must, under the regimen of the\r\nlast ten years, be conveyed overland to New York, or by steamboat to New\r\nOrleans, where it might have to wait ten or twelve days for an Isthmus\r\nsteam-ship, making a circuit of twice to thrice the distance by a direct\r\nroute to its destination. There has been, indeed, for some four years\r\npast, a tri-weekly overland mail from St. Louis via New Mexico and\r\nArizona to San Diego, in the extreme south of California,--a route\r\nnearly a thousand miles longer than it need or should have been, and\r\nevincing a perverse ingenuity in the avoidance not only of Salt Lake and\r\nCarson Valley, but even of Santa Fe. This long and mischievous\r\ndetour--one of the latest of our wholesale sacrifices to Southern\r\njealousy and greed--has at length been definitely abandoned, and,\r\ninstead of a tri-weekly mail via Elposo and the Gila, together with a\r\nweekly by Salt Lake, and a fortnightly or tri-monthly by the Isthmus, we\r\nhave now one daily mail on the direct overland route from the Missouri,\r\nat St. Joseph or Omaha, via the Platte, North Platte, Sweetwater, South\r\nPass, Fort Bridger, Salt Lake, Simpson's route, Carson Valley, and\r\nthence across the Sierra Nevada to Placerville and San Francisco, in\r\nshorter time than was usually made by way of the Isthmus, at less cost\r\nthan that of the three mails which it replaces, while the immense\r\nadvantage of a daily mail each way, over a tri-monthly or even weekly,\r\nneeds no elucidation. The territories of Colorado, Utah, Nevada, are\r\nthus brought into intimate and constant communication with the loyal\r\nStates, and made to feel the mighty pulsations of the National heart, in\r\nthis heroic and eventful crisis of the Republic's history.\r\n\r\nBut this not all, nor the best. The old Congress, among its many wise\r\nand beneficent measures, enacted that the government should aid whatever\r\ncompany would for the lowest annual stipend establish and maintain a\r\nline of Electric Telegraph from Missouri or Iowa to California. A\r\ncontract was accordingly made with the Western Union Telegraph Company,\r\nunder which active operations were commenced last spring, under surveys\r\npreviously made. The grand train of four hundred men, one hundred great\r\nprairie wagons, and six or eight hundred mules or oxen,--a portion of\r\nthe cattle for the subsistence of the party,--started westward from\r\nOmaha, Nebraska, in June last, and on the 4th of July commenced pushing\r\non the construction at the point which it had already reached, some two\r\nor three hundred miles further west in the valley of the Platte. It may\r\ngive to some an idea of the destitution of timber on the great American\r\nDesert, to know that the greatest distance over which poles had to be\r\ndrawn for the elevation of the wires of this telegraph was _only_ 240\r\nmiles! Fresh teams were from time to time dispatched on the track of the\r\nworking carts with additional supplies, and the line was pushed through\r\nto Salt Lake City by the 18th of October. Six days afterward, that point\r\nwas reached by a like party, working eastward from Carson Valley, on\r\nbehalf of the United Telegraph Companies of California, and the young\r\nHercules by the Pacific vied with the infantile but vigorous territories\r\nthis side of her in flashing to Washington and New York assurances of\r\ntheir invincible devotion to the indivisible American Union. So great\r\nand difficult an enterprise was probably never before so expeditiously\r\nand happily achieved in the experience of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe distance--some 1,500 miles--over which a working line of electric\r\ntelegraph has thus been constructed and put in operation in the course\r\nof a single season is one of the minor obstacles surmounted. The want of\r\ntimber is far more serious. From the sink of Carson River, less than one\r\nhundred miles this side of the Sierra, to the point at which the\r\nconstruction of the line was commenced on the Platte as aforesaid, there\r\nis no place at which a tree can fall across the fragile wires; there is\r\nprobably less timber in sight on that whole sixteen hundred miles than\r\nis to-day standing in some single county of New York, Pennsylvania, or\r\nOhio. From the forks of the Platte to the valley of the Sacramento,\r\nthere is not a stick of growing timber that would make a decent\r\naxe-helve, much less a substantial axletree. The Sierra Nevada are\r\nheavily though not densely wooded nearly to their summits, but mainly\r\nwith stately evergreens, including a brittle and worthless live oak; but\r\nthe tough, enduring hickory, the lithe and springy white ash, the\r\nironwood, beech, and sugar maple, are nowhere to be seen. A low, scrubby\r\ncedar and a small, scraggy white pine thinly cover a portion of the\r\nhills and low mountains of Utah; the former is shorter than it should be\r\nfor telegraph poles, but stanch and durable, and is made to do. The\r\ndetestable cotton-wood, most worthless of trees, yet a great deal better\r\nthan none, thinly skirts the banks of the Platte and its affluents, in\r\npatches that grow more and more scarce as you travel westward, until you\r\nonly see them 'afar off' on the sides of some of the mountains that\r\nenclose the South Pass. The Colorado has a still scantier allowance of\r\nthis miserable wood; but the cedars meet you as you ascend from its\r\nvalley to the hills that surround Fort Bridger. Where cotton-wood is\r\nused for poles,--and there are hundreds of miles where no other tree is\r\nfound,--it will have to be replaced very frequently; for it decays\r\nrapidly, and has a fancy for twisting itself into all manner of ungainly\r\nshapes when cut and exposed to the sun and parching winds of the plains.\r\n\r\nWater, next to wood, is the great want of the plains and of the Great\r\nBasin. Travel along either base of the Rocky Mountains, and you are\r\nconstantly meeting joyous, bounding streams, flowing rapidly forth from\r\neach ravine and coursing to the arid plain; but follow them a few miles\r\nand they begin to diminish in volume, and, unless intercepted by a\r\ncopious river, often dwindle to nothing. The Republican fork of the\r\nKansas or Kaw River, after a course of some thirty to fifty miles, sinks\r\nsuddenly into its bed, which thence for twenty miles exhibits nothing\r\nbut a waste of yellow sand. Of course there are seasons when this bed is\r\ncovered with water throughout; but I describe what I saw early in June,\r\nwhen a teamster dug eight feet into that sand without finding a drop of\r\nthe coveted liquid for his thirst-maddened oxen. Two months later, I\r\nobserved the dry bed stretched several miles farther up and down what in\r\nwinter is the river. Passing over to Big Sandy, the most northerly\r\ntributary of the Arkansas, I found dry sand (often incrusted with some\r\nwhite alkaline deposit) the rule; water the rare exception throughout\r\nthe twenty or thirty miles of its course nearest its source. At Denver,\r\non the 6th of June, Cherry Creek contributed to the South Platte a\r\nvolume amply sufficient to run an ordinary grist-mill; ten days\r\nafterwards its bed was dry as a doctrinal sermon. My first encampment on\r\nthe North Platte above Laramie was by a sparkling, dancing stream a yard\r\nwide, which could hardly have been forced through a nine-inch ring; but\r\nthough its current was rapid and the Platte but three miles off, the\r\nthirsty earth and air drank up every drop by the way. Big Sandy, Little\r\nSandy and _Dry_ Sandy are the three tributaries to be crossed between\r\nSouth Pass and the Colorado, and the latter justifies its name through\r\nthe better part of each year. Golden River runs through too deep a\r\nnarrow valley and bears too strong a current from the snowy peaks in\r\nwhich it heads to be thus dried up; so with Bear, Welso, and the\r\nTimpanagos or Jordan, the principal affluents of Salt Lake, which tumble\r\nand roar between lofty peaks the greater part of their respective\r\ncourses; but when you have crossed the Jordan, moving California-ward,\r\nyou will not find another decent mill-stream for the five hundred miles\r\nthat you traverse on your direct (Simpson's) route to the sink of the\r\nCarson. At intervals which seem very long, you find a spring, a scanty\r\nbut welcome stream rushing down between two mountains, to be speedily\r\ndrunk up by the thirsty plain and valley at their base; but you will\r\noftener pass some 'sink' or depression below the general level of the\r\nvalley you are traversing, where a shrewd guess has led to brackish or\r\nsulphurous water by digging two or three feet. A mail station-keeper\r\nlost his oxen, at a point a hundred miles south-west of Salt Lake; they\r\nhad wandered southward on the desert, and he followed their trail for\r\n(as he estimated) a hundred miles, without finding a drop of water, when\r\nhe gave them up, still a day's tramp ahead of him, and turned back to\r\nsave his own life and that of his suffering horse. He might, I presume,\r\nhave gone a hundred miles further without finding aught to drink but\r\ntheir blood.\r\n\r\nThis dearth of wood and water can hardly be realized from any mere\r\ndescription. A life-long denizen of Europe, or of the cis-Alleghany\r\nportion of this continent, is so accustomed to the unfailing presence or\r\nnearness of trees and springs, or streams, that he naturally supposes\r\nthem as universal as the air we breathe. In a New Englander's crude\r\nconception, trees spring up and grow to stately maturity wherever they\r\nare not repressed by constant vigilance and exertion, while brooks and\r\nrivers are implied by the existence of hills and valleys, nay, of any\r\nland whatever. But as you travel westward with the Missouri, springs,\r\nstreams, woods, become palpably scarcer and scarcer, until, unless in\r\nthe immediate valley of the Platte, Arkansas, or some more northerly\r\nriver that rushes full-fed from a long course among the snow-crowned\r\npeaks of the Rocky Mountains, your eye ranges over a vast expanse\r\nwhereon neither forest, grove, nor even a single tree, is visible. If\r\nthe country is rolling, springs may at long intervals be found by those\r\nwho know just where to seek them; but streams are few and scanty, save\r\nin winter, and in later summer they disappear almost entirely. Beyond\r\nSalt Lake, the destitution of wood in Utah and Nevada is far less than\r\non the Plains, but that of water is even greater. Fifty miles from water\r\nto water is the lowest interval in my experience on Simpson's route; but\r\nI only traversed the eastern half of it, turning thence abruptly\r\nnorthward to strike the valley of the Humboldt (formerly known as the\r\nSt. Mary's), which rising in the north-west corner of the new Territory\r\nof Nevada, hardly fifty miles from the southern or Lewis branch of the\r\nColumbia, flows southward from the Goose Creek Mountains that cradled\r\nand nourished it, and thence hardly maintains its volume (which is that\r\nof a decent mill stream) in its generally south-west course of three\r\nhundred and fifty miles, till it is two thirds lost in a lake and the\r\nresidue in a reedy slough or sink, a hundred miles from the Sierra\r\nNevada and forty from the similar sink of the Carson, a larger and less\r\nimpulsive stream which drains a considerable section of the eastern\r\ndeclivity of the Sierra Nevada only to meet this inglorious end.\r\nDoubtless, the time has been when a large portion of western Nevada\r\nformed one great lake or inland sea, whereof Pyramid and Mud Lakes, and\r\nthe sinks respectively of the Carson, Walker and Humboldt rivers, are\r\nall that the thirsty earth and air have left us. The forty miles of low,\r\nflat, naked desert--in part of heavy, wearying sand--that now separates\r\nthe sink of the Humboldt from that of the Carson, was evidently long\r\nunder water, and might, to all human perception, have better remained\r\nso.\r\n\r\nI can not comprehend those who talk of the Plains and the more intensely\r\narid wilds which mainly compose Utah and Nevada becoming a great\r\nstock-growing region. Even California, though its climate favors the\r\nrapid multiplication and generous growth of cattle and sheep, can never\r\nsustain so many animals to the square mile as the colder and more rugged\r\nhills of New York and New England, because of the intense protracted\r\ndrouth of its summers, which suffer no blade of grass to grow throughout\r\nthe six later months of every year. Animals live and thrive on the\r\ndead-ripe herbage of the earlier months; but a large area is soon\r\nexhausted by a herd, which must be pastured elsewhere till the winter\r\nrains ensure a renewal of vegetation.\r\n\r\nBut the grasses of the Great Valley and of a large portion of the Plains\r\nare exceedingly scanty where they exist at all, so that the teams and\r\nherds annually driven across them by emigrants and traders suffer\r\nfearfully, and are often decimated by hunger, though they carefully seek\r\nout and adhere to the trails whereon feed is least scanty. Many a weary\r\nday's journey, even along the valleys of the North Platte and\r\nSweetwater, brings to view too little grass to sustain the life of a\r\nmoderate herd; those who have traversed the South Pass in June will\r\ngenerally have just escaped starvation, leaving to those that come\r\nstraggling or tottering after them a very poor feed. The carcasses of\r\ndead animals, in every stage of decomposition, thickly stud the great\r\ntrail from the banks of the Platte westward to the passes of the Sierra\r\nNevada, and, I presume, to the banks of the Columbia, bearing mute but\r\nimpressive testimony to the chronic inhospitality of the Great American\r\nDesert, which is almost everywhere thinly overgrown by worthless shrubs,\r\nknown to travelers as grease-wood and sage brush;--the former prickly\r\nand repellant, but having a waxy or resinous property which renders it\r\nuseful to emigrants as fuel; the latter affording shelter and\r\nsubsistence to rabbits and a poor species of grouse known as the 'sage\r\nhen,' but utterly worthless to man and to the beasts obedient to his\r\nsway.\r\n\r\nYet the daily Overland Mail is an immense, a cheering fact, and the\r\nPacific Telegraph another. A message dispatched from any village blessed\r\nwith electric wires on poles in the Atlantic States will probably reach\r\nits destination in any city or considerable settlement of California or\r\nNevada within a few hours, while every transpiring incident of the war\r\nfor the Union is directly flashed across the continent to the journals\r\nof Sacramento and San Francisco, and will often be devoured by their\r\nreaders on the evening after its occurrence. The Republic may well be\r\nproud of having achieved two such strides in her onward, upward course,\r\nin the midst of a great and desolating war, and with confidence implore\r\na God of beneficent justice to hasten the auspicious day when we shall\r\nbe able to telegraph her children by the far Pacific that her enemies\r\nare baffled, vanquished, humbled, and that there opens again before her\r\na long vista of unbroken and honorable peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TO DO WITH THE DARKIES.\r\n\r\nA NEW AND ORIGINAL PLAN FOR SAVING THE UNION ON SOUTHERN PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that the overwhelming difficulty of the present\r\nday, is the proper disposal of the Negro.\r\n\r\nThe writer of these lines takes the liberty of believing that the war is\r\nvirtually a settled affair. There has been, there is, no diminution of\r\nNorthern determination to push on and keep pushing until the wings of\r\nthe eagle again stretch from Maine to the Rio Grande. The administration\r\nis sustained, as from the first, by ever increasing majorities. The\r\ndaily defeats of those politicians who are known to sympathize with\r\nsecession, the wreck of the peace party, and the growing indignation of\r\nthe country, as manifested against all halfway men and measures, are\r\nbecoming what in sober seriousness can not be regarded as other than a\r\ntremendous moral spectacle. _In medio non tutissimus ibis_.\r\n\r\nYet at the bottom of this foaming cup of joy remain the black dregs. I\r\nwould not invidiously compare the unfortunate black to the 'dregs of the\r\npopulace,' since labor in any form must not be lightly spoken of. But it\r\nwould be the weakest of euphuisms to affect ignorance of the social\r\nposition which he occupies, and which, not to increase the misery of his\r\nposition, is indubitably 'at the bottom of the ladder.' But that which\r\nis at the bottom of the ladder may seriously affect its position and\r\nstanding. There is a fearful and thrilling illustration of this, to be\r\nfound in a popular cut graphically described in these words:\r\n\r\n     A negro on the top of a high ladder, white-washing, a hog lifting\r\n     it up from beneath. 'G'way dar,--you'm makin' mischief.'\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln is understood to favor emigration. This looks well.\r\nCarry the blacks away to Liberia. Unfortunately I am informed that\r\n_eight and a half Great Easterns_, each making one trip per month, could\r\nonly export the annual increase of our Southern slaves. This speaks in\r\nthunder tones, even to the welkin, and provokes a scream from the eagle.\r\nIt is impossible.\r\n\r\nBut what shall we do with our blacks, since it is really impossible,\r\nthen, to export the dark, industrial, productive, proletarian,\r\noperative, laboring element from our midst?\r\n\r\nI suggest as a remedy that they continue in our midst, with this\r\namendment, that they be concentrated in that same 'midst' and the\r\n'midst' be removed a little to one side. In other words, let us centre\r\nthem all in one State, _that State to be South Carolina_.\r\n\r\nThe justice of this arrangement must be apparent to every one. It is\r\nevident that if the present occupation by our troops continue much\r\nlonger, there will be no white men left in South Carolina, neither is it\r\nlikely that they will ever return. Terror and pride combined must ever\r\nkeep the native whites from repopulating that region. And, as South\r\nCarolina was especially the State which brought about this war, for the\r\nexpress purpose of making the black man the basis of its society, there\r\nwould be a wonderful and fearful propriety in carrying out that theory,\r\nor 'sociology,' even to perfection; making the negro not only the basis\r\nof society, but _all_ society there whatever,--top, bottom, and sides.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this absolute perfection of their theory was never\r\ncontemplated even by the celebrated Hammond. But truth compels the\r\ndeduction, and reason admits it. _Verus in uno, verus in omnibus_.\r\n\r\nI trust that the reader will not be startled, nor accuse the writer of\r\nthese lines of lacking patriotism, when he avows that since the Southern\r\nsocial philosophers have boldly started a tremendous and original\r\ntheory, he should be very sorry not to see it fairly tested, tried, and\r\nworked out. Every great doctrine or idea, be it for good or evil, must\r\nand will work itself out, that of mudsill-ism and negro labor among the\r\nrest. Only I claim that it should be complete in its elements,\r\neliminated of what the African, with a fine intuition of the truth,\r\ningenuously terms 'de wite trash,'--yes, in the Southern social scheme\r\nthe whites _are_ trash,--and they only find their place as a sort of\r\nuseless ornament, non-productive and inoperative, even according to\r\ntheir own ideas. Therefore the 'wite trash' must be eliminated.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another and a very beautiful argument to be adduced in\r\nfavor of colonizing South Carolina with 'contrabands.' It must be\r\napparent to the blindest eye that the negro inclines idiosyncratically\r\nto Southern institutions far more zealously than even Mr. Jefferson\r\nDavis can be presumed to do. He is the most driving of drivers, the\r\nseverest of overseers, the most aristocratic of aristocrats, the most\r\nSouthern of Southerners. The planter despises poverty, but what is his\r\ncontempt of a poor white man compared to that of his slave for such\r\nwretchedness? What indeed is the negro but an intensified Creole? His\r\nvery color reflects that of his swarthy lord. The planter is tanned, but\r\nthe negro is 'black and tanned,'--tanned always on the face, and not\r\nunfrequently on the back!\r\n\r\nThe black, left to his own instincts in Africa, develops the Southern\r\nsociology to a degree which casts entirely into pitiable pettiness the\r\npuling despotism of the calaboose and slave market. Witness Dahomey,\r\nwhere all lives, all fortunes, all persons, are coördinated in one\r\nperfect 'system' of subjugation to one sable Jefferson Davis Gezo, who\r\nis _de jure divino_ husband by a sublime fiction of law to every woman\r\non the sacred soil of Africa, and master of the lives of all of both\r\nsexes. What to this stupendous and perfect theory is the impotent and\r\nimperfect scheme so lamely announced by the sociologists of the C. S. A.?\r\n\r\nI claim that by every law of logic the Southern philosophers have\r\nproclaimed themselves inferior to the negro, and worthy to be swept away\r\nto make place for him. They have claimed for him the most important\r\nplace in the body politic, and as, _ex uno disce omnes_, the whole\r\nshould be homogeneous with a part, especially the main part, it follows\r\nthat the negro, and the negro alone, should be allowed to rule in a land\r\nwhere, as Southerners declare, 'God clearly intended him to live.' Now\r\nif God clearly intended him to live there, it must follow that he did\r\nnot intend white men to reside in those regions. It may be observed in\r\nthis connection that the _Bible_ forms the great basis of all Southern\r\nargument. If a Northern writer advances any of the ignorant and impious\r\ndoctrines, so common among his kind, against slavery, he is promptly and\r\nproperly met with the query, 'Do you believe in the Bible?' Now the\r\n_Bible_ endorses slavery past, and 'of course' slavery present. But the\r\n_Bible_ also insists that the curse of labor was laid on man by the\r\neating of the apple. On _all_ men, be it observed, without distinction\r\nof color. But the Southerners have claimed, time and again, that 'only\r\nthe black can work in the South.' Therefore it logically results, on\r\nSouthern grounds, that the white man has no business whatever in the\r\nSouth, since he _must_ work somewhere, and it can not be in the land of\r\nrice and cotton. Who then should inhabit that sunny clime save the\r\n'contraband'--who should there claim the respect due to the lord of the\r\nsoil if not he?\r\n\r\n  'Yo que soy contrabandista\r\n  Y campo à mé respeto.'\r\n\r\nThe more I study this subject the more does my soul expand in awe as I\r\nwatch the fearful unfoldings of the terrible moral law which governs the\r\nactions of humanity. Ah, Heaven! it is fearful, it is awful to consider\r\nhow ignorantly we begin our beginnings without anticipating the\r\nmarvelous endings to which they rise, even as a match ignorantly lighted\r\nmay explode the dusky grain which sends a city skyward! The South has\r\ntoiled to elaborate a philosophy and an empire on the Nigger--and, lo!\r\nat the end thereof looms up the tremendous Afreet realm of a perfect\r\nNiggerdom, in which the white element, which first started it into life,\r\nmust logically be swept away, like the worthless _exuviæ_ of a shell\r\nfrom the head of a young dragon.\r\n\r\nAs one who boldly claims respect for the 'system' of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, but who wishes for its perfect development, I therefore\r\nsuggest that South Carolina be set aside for the great experiment. Let\r\nthe negro be there allowed to congregate and expand even to his utmost\r\ncapacity. Let all the poetry and beauty of Southern institutions be\r\nconcentrated in that happy realm, where, amid the groans of endless\r\nlabor and the swinging of countless whips, he may show the world what he\r\nmay become. Already the South has proved his capacity to work sixteen\r\nhours a day and dance all night--perhaps under _black_ rulers he may be\r\nbrought to work twenty hours a day, and give up dancing altogether. I\r\nclaim, as one holding advanced Southern views, that this proposition be\r\nallowed a fair trial. If not, I shall at least have the satisfaction of\r\nhaving put my views before the world to bide their time. A truth never\r\ndies. Coming ages will at least do me justice. _Magna est Veritas et\r\nprevalebit._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE-TRADE IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Convention which in 1787 framed the Federal Constitution,\r\ndespite its firmness and patriotism, was, like all public bodies,\r\nevidently not entirely devoid of a spirit of compromise. A majority of\r\nits members were desirous of freeing the institutions of the young\r\nnation from the burden of slavery, and yet they consented to engraft the\r\nfollowing provision upon the body of our American fundamental law:--\r\n\r\n\"The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now\r\nexisting shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibited by Congress\r\nprior to the year 1808.\"\r\n\r\nCongress was awake, however, even during the administration of\r\nWashington, to its duty in the matter, and an act was passed declaring\r\nthe slave-trade to be piracy. Twenty years afterward the principal\r\nEuropean sovereigns united in the same declaration, and so the execrable\r\ncommerce was hurled beyond the pale of international law. There is now\r\nno probability that it will ever regain its rank 'on change.' But its\r\nillegitimation does not seem to have greatly circumscribed its activity.\r\nIn the face of apparent danger, it has continued to flourish, and there\r\nhas been hardly more risk to a _pirate_ with a living cargo from Gaboon,\r\nthan would be encountered by an ordinary merchantman from pirates in the\r\nGulf. Indeed, there were many who believed and feared, prior to the\r\nbreaking out of the present rebellion, that the next compromise between\r\nthe North and South would be the repeal of all laws prohibiting the\r\nAfrican slave-trade. So rapidly yet so insidiously was the South\r\nobtaining an entire control in the councils of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt was notorious that a large proportion of the vessels which were\r\nengaged in the infamous traffic were owned and fitted out by Northern\r\ncapitalists. The General Government did not exert itself in good faith\r\nto carry out either its treaty stipulations nor the legislation of\r\nCongress in regard to the matter. If a vessel was captured, her owners\r\nwere permitted to bond her, and thus continue her in the trade; and if\r\nany man was convicted of this form of piracy, the executive always\r\ninterposed between him and the penalty of his crime. The laws providing\r\nfor the seizure of vessels engaged in the traffic were so constructed as\r\nto render the duty unremunerative; and marshals now find their fees for\r\nsuch services to be actually less than their necessary expenses. No one\r\nwho bears this fact in mind will be surprised at the great indifference\r\nof these officers to the continuing of the slave-trade; in fact, he will\r\nbe ready to learn that the laws of Congress upon the subject had become\r\na dead letter, and that the suspicion was well grounded that certain\r\nofficers of the Federal Government had actually connived at their\r\nviolation.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons engaged in the slave-trade, and the amount of\r\ncapital embarked in it, exceed our powers of calculation. The city of\r\nNew York has been until of late the principal port of the world for this\r\ninfamous commerce; although the cities of Portland and Boston are only\r\nsecond to her in that distinction. Slave dealers added largely to the\r\nwealth of our commercial metropolis; they contributed liberally to the\r\ntreasuries of political organizations, and their bank accounts were\r\nlargely depleted to carry elections in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\r\nConnecticut. It was natural for the leaders of the party which they had\r\naided, to accord to them, as an equivalent, many facilities for carrying\r\non their business. There is indeed no occasion for wonder at the\r\ncountenance and impunity long given to such auxiliaries. If a few of\r\nthem chanced to be of Knickerbocker stock, and to bear the talisman\r\nwhich affords admission to the higher circles of Gothamite\r\nrespectability, it is only what might have been expected. There are such\r\nmen everywhere, even in the Tombs.\r\n\r\nIt requires no miraculous gift to be able to perceive why the late\r\nadministration at Washington was sensitive as to the visitation of\r\nAmerican vessels of doubtful character, by the officers of British\r\ncruisers. There was no principle at stake; but the slave-dealing\r\ninterest had demanded as an immunity, that the piece of bunting known as\r\nthe American flag should be allowed to protect from scrutiny every\r\nsuspicious ship over which it should be raised. They had the power or\r\ninfluence to command; and the administration obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe present administration appears to have awakened somewhat to this\r\nsubject. The principal appointments for the Atlantic ports were given to\r\nmen of anti-slavery proclivities. The new marshal of the southern\r\ndistrict of New York was of different material from his predecessors,\r\nand fortunately he was no novice. He was familiar with the habits of the\r\nmen engaged in the slave trade; he was ambitious and eager to signalize\r\nhimself for efficiency. In three months he had seized nine vessels, and\r\narrested twenty-eight men who had outfitted, commanded, or served on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior now resolved that the business should be\r\nbroken up in every port of the United States. He accordingly issued an\r\norder to the several marshals of the States and districts lying upon the\r\nseaboard, directing them to assemble at the city of New York, on the\r\nfifteenth day of August, 1861, for the purpose of agreeing upon a system\r\nof measures for the effectual suppression of the slave-trade in American\r\nports.\r\n\r\nBurton's old Theatre, formerly dedicated to the 'sock and buskin,' and\r\nfamous during the religious revival of 1858, was now occupied by this\r\nconvention of marshals. Waiving unnecessary parliamentary usages, these\r\nministers of the law sat with closed doors, and discussed familiarly the\r\nbusiness in which they had engaged. They investigated carefully the\r\nwhole subject in its minuter details, and visited the slave brigs and\r\nschooners which had been captured and were then lying at the Atlantic\r\nDock in Brooklyn. A plan of operations was concerted, by which the\r\nmarshals of the different districts should co-operate with each other in\r\ndetecting and bringing to justice persons guilty of participating in the\r\nslave-trade. The results of this measure can not fail to be beneficial;\r\nand, indeed, the marshals have already become so active and efficient,\r\nthat the capitalists who have maintained this branch of commerce are\r\nactually contemplating its transferment to European ports. So much for\r\nthe convocation at Burton's Theatre. Let us now examine the principal\r\nfeatures of the traffic, and the practices of those by whom it is\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVE DEALING IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nThe principal slave captains and chief officers of vessels engaged in\r\nthe slave-trade have their residences and boarding-places in the eastern\r\nwards of the city, most of them being between James and Houston Streets.\r\nThey are known to every one who has an investment in the business.\r\nIndeed, they are all members of a secret fraternity, having its signs,\r\ngrips, and pass-words. 'While I was in Eldridge-street jail,' said one\r\nof them, 'Captain Loretti was captured and brought there. He did not\r\nknow any one, but I shook hands with him, and we became acquainted at\r\nonce.'\r\n\r\nThe arrival of a slave captain from one voyage is the signal for\r\npreparation for another. Negotiations are carried on, generally in the\r\nfirst-class hotels. The contracts for the City of Norfolk and several\r\nother notorious slavers were made at the Astor House. The risk of\r\ndetection is less at such a public place than it would be at a private\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nA man who had failed in business on Greenwich Street was recently\r\nengaged in fitting out these vessels for their African voyage. He was\r\nfirst sent to procure apparatus for the refining of palm oil. This was\r\nbut a blind, the practice being to take out the machinery, and employ\r\nthe boiler for culinary purposes, until the vessels had got out to sea,\r\nand there was no farther necessity for duping inquisitive persons. This\r\nman was also commissioned to purchase wooden ware, champagne, and other\r\nnecessary articles. Such were the business agents and their duty; all\r\nwas liberally paid for and promptly supplied.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a vessel is ready and officered for the voyage, measures are\r\ntaken to procure a crew. Slave-traders employ for this the services of\r\n'runners,' who constitute a caste of pariahs of the most degraded kind.\r\nA conscientious scruple would seem never to enter into their\r\ncalculations. They would hardly recognize a precept of the decalogue\r\nexcept by the circumstance of its violation. Earning their livelihood\r\nthus basely, debauchery and crime constitute their every-day history.\r\nThese persons keep a record of the names of men who have served on slave\r\nships, or been guilty of mutiny, or other villany. So accurate is their\r\ninformation and so expert are they in their estimate of character, that\r\nthey seldom commit a blunder, or furnish a seaman who is not the man for\r\nthe vocation. The crew which they select are indeed 'picked men.' They\r\nare of every nationality, and are taken from the seamen's\r\nboarding-houses in the lower wards of the city.\r\n\r\nA few years since, the information was received in New York that a yacht\r\nwas lying in Long Island Sound, and that circumstances warranted the\r\nsuspicion that she was intended for the slave-trade. The marshal, with a\r\ndisplay of enthusiastic zeal for the execution of the laws, proceeded to\r\nthe place with a strong force of assistants, and took charge of the\r\nyacht; but subsequent investigations failed to criminate her. The\r\nreputed owner declared that he had fitted her out for a pleasure\r\nexcursion; that was all. The vessel was discharged, and a few months\r\nafterward landed a cargo of negroes on the coast of Georgia. So easy has\r\nit been to deceive the Federal officers. The owner of the yacht\r\nafterward declared that he paid ten thousand dollars to get his vessel\r\nclear of the harbor of New York.\r\n\r\nThe obtaining of a clearance at the custom-house was not a very\r\ndifficult matter. Slavers were never detained by any extraordinary\r\ncuriosity on the part of those having cognizance of their departure.\r\nThey had but to assume a transparent disguise, raise the American flag,\r\nand keep up the show till they arrived at the intermediate port. Here\r\nthe national ensign was changed, the papers of the vessel were altered,\r\nand necessary arrangements were made for receiving a cargo of slaves.\r\n\r\nFactories or agencies are maintained on the African coast, where the\r\nvessels obtain their living freight. The captains seldom go on shore\r\nexcept for purpose of observation. Each vessel generally takes with her\r\nfrom New York a Spaniard to transact the business. The complement being\r\nobtained, it only remains to get away and beyond the cruisers. The\r\naction of the Federal government, some years since, in relation to the\r\nvisitation of vessels, has been effectual in impairing the energy of the\r\nBritish squadron, which has been maintained on the coast of Africa,\r\npursuant to the treaty of Washington. As for the American squadron, it\r\nnever co-operated heartily in the matter of suppressing the slave-trade;\r\nand the vessels were generally absent for the purpose of obtaining coal,\r\nor for repairs, whenever there was opportunity of making a capture.\r\n\r\nBut the capitalists of New York do not depend entirely upon these\r\nprecautions. Their vessels are occasionally taken; and then the men on\r\nboard must be protected, or they will disclose everything. Not only are\r\nappliances used to make an examination result in a discharge, but a\r\ncorps of attorneys is kept under pay to defend those who fall within the\r\nclutches of the law. The impunity which has attended these men is\r\nnotorious.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN LATHAM.\r\n\r\nSome time ago the brig Cora was captured at sea and brought by a prize\r\ncrew to the port of New York. Her commander, Captain Latham, was\r\nincarcerated in Eldridge-street jail. Hendrickson, the mate, was,\r\nhowever, permitted to communicate to his friends on shore, who procured\r\na boat, pulled quietly to the side of the brig, received him on board,\r\nand took him ashore. His clothing and other property were conveyed to\r\nthe office of the marshal, and he was not only permitted to go and take\r\nthem away, but to visit his acquaintances in Eldridge-street jail. It\r\nwas an easy matter to arrest him, but the marshal remarked to an\r\nassociate that he did not care how the man made his money.\r\n\r\nCaptain Latham, meanwhile, remained at the jail. At the time referred\r\nto, that place would seem to have been as jovial and sociable as a\r\nclub-room. The present marshal, not liking the arrangements, removed all\r\nthe Federal prisoners to the Tombs, where they could be kept more\r\nsecurely and excluded from seeing improper visitors. The men who were\r\nengaged in the slave-trade were in the habit of visiting their friends\r\nin 'Eldridge Street,' and holding regular carousals. They were permitted\r\nto visit there, it is said, at late hours in the evening, and as early\r\nas seven o'clock in the morning. A man residing in the seventh ward, but\r\ndoing business on South Street, would come of a Saturday night and pay\r\nthe board of the officers of the captured slave vessel. A Spaniard named\r\nSanchez, now a prisoner at the Tombs, was a frequent guest; and\r\noccasionally a marshal would be present. Others were also permitted. The\r\nprisoners whom they visited were allowed to come into the office;\r\nchampagne and other liquors would be produced, and the company would\r\nhave a 'good time.'\r\n\r\nCaptain Latham is one of the most ingenious men. He has learned the\r\ngipsy art of dyeing his face; and he can elude the closest observer.\r\nWhen he falls into the power of the ministers of the law, he is shielded\r\nby the efforts of the heaviest capitalists who have engaged in the\r\nslave-trade; and they honor all his demands. At his examination he was\r\nidentified by the marshal's assistants, and by two persons who were\r\nemployed at the custom-house. It was arranged, however, that when he\r\nshould be arraigned for trial, each of these persons should profess\r\nhimself to be unable to recognize him. One of them is said to have\r\nreceived five hundred dollars, and the others two hundred apiece, for\r\nthis want of memory.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining some twelve weeks at the jail, Captain Latham determined\r\nnot to await a trial. He obtained the aid of one of the marshal's\r\nassistants; a 'friend' of his, who has a place of business in Wall\r\nStreet, advancing three thousand dollars. One of his attorneys was also\r\nin the secret. A writ of _habeas corpus_ was obtained from the recorder,\r\nand dismissed for want of jurisdiction. This was all done to elude\r\nsuspicion. A ticket for a passage to Havana was procured; and on the day\r\nthat the steamer was to sail, a carriage, in which were Sanchez, the\r\nmarshal's assistant, and a friend, drove to the jail. Bidding farewell\r\nto his fellow-prisoners, some of whom knew what was going on, Latham\r\nleft his apartments and took a seat by Sanchez. The four drove to the\r\nclothing warehouse of Brooks Brothers in Broadway, purchased a suit of\r\nclothing, and ordered another. It was now almost the hour for the\r\nsteamer to leave. Latham returned to the carriage, and was driven to the\r\npier, arriving there just in time to get on board. It is said that he\r\nhas since returned to New York; but only his friends have recognized\r\nhim. The men who aided his escape are now in prison.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the capitalists who are engaged in this traffic\r\nare as profuse toward other prisoners as they were to Captain Latham.\r\nThere was among those who were removed from the jail to the City Prison,\r\none man who had sailed as mate with Latham. When he was captured he was\r\nin the employment of a house in Beaver Street, which has also a branch\r\nin Havana. He too had formed a plan of escape by bribing a warden and\r\ngetting a friend to personate one of the marshal's assistants, who\r\nshould profess to come for him by an order from a commissioner. But when\r\nhis wife applied to his employer for money to carry out this plan, she\r\nwas dismissed with a solitary dollar. This prisoner had probably fallen\r\nfrom favor, and was therefore abandoned to the mercy of the law.\r\n\r\nThe names of the prominent slave-traders, their residences and places of\r\nbusiness, are known to the marshal. Several of them have fled from the\r\ncity; among them, a woman of wealth residing in St. Mark's Place. Their\r\noperations have been largely curtailed, and it has become almost\r\nimpossible for a slaver to leave New York. With the concert of action\r\nagreed upon by the convention at Burton's Theatre, it is to be hoped\r\nthat the slave-trade will be exterminated in every Northern port. Some\r\nlegislation by Congress to increase the powers of the marshals, and\r\nefficient action on the part of the executive, are all that is now\r\nrequired to sweep the infamous commerce from the ocean.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, Captain Gordon, of the slaver Erie, has\r\nbeen convicted of piracy, before the United States Court for the\r\nSouthern District of New York. It is needless to say that this\r\nconviction is the completest triumph which Freedom has yet gained in our\r\ncountry against her adversary. It indicates more clearly even than any\r\nevent of the war, that Southern social influences are yielding, and that\r\nere long we shall be free from all their taint. Like the defeat of\r\nFernando Wood, like the breaking up of the Peace Party, like the rapidly\r\nprogressing crusade against old political corruption, it shows that\r\nthere is a reformation afoot which will work wonders, and prove to the\r\nworld that the mass of corruption in this country, so generally\r\nattributed to the working of republican institutions, is in reality due\r\nto a diametrically opposite cause--to the influence of a party which in\r\nall its feelings is essentially that of despotism. May we all live to\r\nsee its last trace obliterated from the free North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE REJECTED STONE: OR, INSURRECTION vs.\r\n     RESURRECTION. By a Native of Virginia. Boston: Walker,\r\n     Wise & Company, 245 Washington Street.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the native of Virginia who penned this volume\r\nhas not published his name, that the world might know who it was that\r\nproduced the most vigorous, unflinching, and brilliant work which has\r\nthus far resulted from the war. In sober seriousness, we have not as\r\nyet, in any journal or in any quarter, encountered such a handling of\r\nfacts without gloves; such a rough-riding over old prejudices,\r\ntimidities, and irresolution; such reckless straight-forwardness in\r\ndeclaring what should be done to settle the great dispute, or such\r\nlaughing-devil sarcasm in ripping up dough-face weakness and\r\ncompromising hesitation. Its principle and refrain, urged with abundant\r\nwit, ingenuity and courage, is simply EMANCIPATION--not on the narrow\r\nground of abolition, but on the necessity of promptly destroying an evil\r\nwhich threatens to vitiate the white race. In the beginning the author\r\npoints out the inevitableness of the present war, and that our political\r\nsystem has been hitherto a sacrifice to Slavery for the time, but also a\r\nrunning up of arrears in favor of Liberty.\r\n\r\n     'In forming this government, Slavery clutched at the strength of\r\n     the law; Freedom relied on the inviolable justice of the ages. They\r\n     have both had, they must have, their reward. That it was and is\r\n     thus, is apparent from the very clauses under which Slavery claims\r\n     eminent domain in this country; they are all written as for an\r\n     institution passing away; the sources of it are sealed up so far as\r\n     they could be; and all the provisions for it--the crutches by which\r\n     it should limp as decently as possible to the grave--were so worded\r\n     that, when Slavery should be buried, no dead letter would stand in\r\n     the Constitution as its epitaph. It is even so. No historian a\r\n     thousand years hence could show from that instrument that a single\r\n     slave was ever held under it.' ... 'Slavery now appeals to arms\r\n     because Freedom, in her slow but steady progress, has left no\r\n     informality--no flaw--which can be seized on to reverse the\r\n     decision she has gained in any higher court.'\r\n\r\nThe style of this book is remarkable. The wealth of simile which bursts\r\nout genially and involuntarily is only paralleled by its strange\r\nvariety, recalling CARLYLE in pleasant, piquant singularity.\r\nIts humor is irresistible; none the less so for being keenly satirical.\r\nWe regret that our limits forbid copious extracts from these treasures,\r\nbut do the more earnestly entreat the reader to buy the volume and make\r\nhimself familiar with it. Whoever our Virginian may be, he is a rising\r\nstar, well worth observing. We find him at times a gleaming\r\nenthusiast,--a man burning with the spirit of the war, involuntarily\r\nuttering the most thrilling passages of Scripture,--and again provoking\r\nlaughter by dry humor and cutting jests. Let the reader in illustration\r\ntake the following paragraphs in the same sequence in which they occur\r\nin the original work.\r\n\r\n\r\n     '\"Thou hast conquered, O Galilean!\" said dying Julian the apostate.\r\n     The North may, _and will_, now collect the bones of her\r\n     great-browed children who yielded because she said yield; the\r\n     fallen pillars of her crumbled church; her children whose wounds\r\n     yet smoke fresh from the state of Slavery;--and broken now upon the\r\n     stone she so long refused, shall write as their epitaph.\r\n\r\n     _Vicisti Humanitas!_\r\n\r\n     (_The Privateer_.) 'A cry comes up to the ear of America,--a long,\r\n     piercing cry of amazement and indignation,--recognizable as one\r\n     which can come only when the profoundest depths of the human\r\n     pocket are stirred. The privateers are at large! They have taken\r\n     away my coffee, and I know not where they have laid it. They have\r\n     taken my India goods with swords and staves. For my first-class\r\n     ship they have cast lots!\r\n\r\n     'Was such depravity ever known before? So long as it was a human\r\n     soul, launched by God on the eternal sea, that they despised; so\r\n     long as it was only a few million bales of humanity captured; so\r\n     long as it was but the scuttling the hearts of mothers and fathers\r\n     and husbands and wives,--we remained patient and resigned,--did we\r\n     not? But coffee and sugar--Good God! what is that blockade about?\r\n     To seize a poor innocent sloop--has Slavery no bowels? And its\r\n     helpless family of molasses barrels;--can hearts be so void of\r\n     pity? Slavery must end. The spirit of the age demands it. The blood\r\n     of a dozen captured freights crieth to Heaven in silveriest accents\r\n     against it.\r\n\r\n     'Brothers, there is a laughter that opens into the fountain of\r\n     tears.'\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the President, in which the Executive is reminded that it\r\nis not often in this world that to one man is given the magnificent\r\nopportunity which the madness of a great wrong has placed within his\r\nreach,--as indeed in every chapter,--the real crisis in which this\r\ncountry is now involved, and the only means of prompt and effectual\r\nextrication, are pointed out with irresistible vehemence and shrewd\r\nintelligence. The author declares, and truly enough, that there are\r\nresources in this land, did we only draw on them, which would close this\r\nwar with the closing of this year. The futile and frivolous objections\r\nwhich have been urged against this great scheme of warfare for the\r\npresent, and of national progress in future, are most ably refuted;\r\nwhile through all runs the same vein of satire, wit, scholarship and\r\nmanly sincerity. It is, in a word, a good book, and one fully suited to\r\nthese brave and warlike times.\r\n\r\n     THE WORKS OF FRANCIS BACON, Baron of Verulam, Viscount of\r\n     St. Albans and Lord High Chancellor of England. Collected and\r\n     edited by James Spedding, M.A., Robert Leslie Ellis, M.A., and\r\n     Douglas Denyn Heath. Boston: Brown & Taggard. Volumes I. and II.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said in praise of the monks of old for preserving works of\r\nsolid wisdom; but why can not a good word be said for those publishers\r\nof the present day who confer a service by not merely embalming, but by\r\nreviving and sending forth by thousands into real life the best books of\r\nthe past? There are many authors who are quoted by everybody, and read\r\nby very few, simply because good modern editions of their works, at a\r\nmoderate price, are rare.\r\n\r\nBACON is preëminently one of these; so much, indeed, is he a\r\ncase in point, that BULWER in speaking of the celebrated axiom,\r\nKnowledge is Power, employs him as an example to warn a young scholar\r\nfrom quoting at second-hand an author whom he has never read.\r\n\r\nThe present edition includes all the works extant of Lord BACON,\r\nembracing, as we learn from SPEDDING'S preface (which has the rare\r\ndefect of being much too brief), a biography, which in minute detail and\r\ncareful finish, and facts hitherto unpublished, will far surpass any\r\nbefore written. Yet, to stay the appetite of the reader, anxious to\r\nrevive the main points of BACON'S life, he gives in this first volume\r\nthe short biography by Dr. WILLIAM RAWLEY. In addition to these\r\nintroductions, we are gratified by a general preface to BACON'S\r\nPhilosophical Works, by ROBERT LESLIE HARRIS, one to the _Parasceve_ by\r\nJAMES SPEDDING, and a third to the _De Augmentis Scientiarum_, in which\r\nBACON'S claims to be the creator of what is popularly and generally\r\nunderstood as the Inductive Philosophy are most fairly examined; not in\r\nthe spirit of the common biographer who always canonizes his subject\r\nthrough thick and thin, but in that of an impartial seeker for truth,\r\nresolved to naught extenuate and set down naught in malice. It is\r\nbelieved by many that BACON was simply so fortunate as to have his\r\npicture stand as the frontispiece of the new Philosophy, when in truth\r\nother contemporaries, who made great discoveries by following precisely\r\nhis method, as, for instance, GALILEO, were quite as much entitled to\r\nthe glory. But examination of BACON'S works proves that though the\r\ngreat work of proof never was completed by him, that which he embraced,\r\nforesaw, and projected, was of that vast comprehensiveness which fully\r\nentitles him to be regarded, not merely as the most proper of _names_\r\nwhereby to indicate the author of Induction (since the world must always\r\nhave a name), but in reality the one of all others who best understood\r\nwhat form the development of science must assume to become perfect. The\r\ntreatment of this question by the editors is truly interesting, and\r\nworthy their great undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe two volumes before us, in addition to the prefaces and biography,\r\nembrace the _Novum Organum_, 'the _Parasceve_,' and the work _De\r\nAugmentis Scientiarum_. It is to be regretted that the English versions,\r\ncorrected by BACON himself, were omitted, but those who would\r\nread the translations are mostly capable of reading 'Baconian Latin.' As\r\nthey are, they will be most gratefully accepted by thousands. The\r\nforthcoming volumes will embrace the English works. We would here wish\r\nthat the editor had not, as he informs us he has done, modernized the\r\nspelling,--but here the majority of readers will perhaps be thankful\r\nthat such is the case. As regards typography, paper, and all outward\r\ngrace, this edition leaves literally nothing to be wished for, while a\r\nshort critical article on the portraits of BACON leads us to\r\ninfer that the exquisitely engraved head of the philosopher, given in\r\nthe first volume, has been made accurate at the cost of great research\r\nand labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE OLD LOG SCHOOLHOUSE. By Alexander Clark, Editor of\r\n     _'Clark's School Visitor.'_ Philadelphia: Leary, Getz & Co.\r\n\r\nMr. CLARK is the most modest of writers; one in whose writings\r\nunaffected simplicity and freedom from literary conceit is manifest on\r\nevery page. He appears in all the many sketches which constitute this\r\nvolume to have written for the direct purpose of pleasing and teaching\r\nyouthful readers or quiet and pious grown persons. He neither eyes the\r\nworld through a lorgnette or a lorgnon, nor affects a knowledge of all\r\nthings, nor even hints at it. Yet it is precisely in this that the charm\r\nof his stories consist--they are perfectly rational, and told in the\r\nplain language which becomes them. It is to be desired that Mr.\r\nCLARK will give us a volume of sketches devoted entirely to\r\nthat Western and rural life which he sketches with such felicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SONGS IN MANY KEYS. By Oliver Wendell Holmes. Boston:\r\n     Ticknor & Fields, 1861.\r\n\r\nIt is only a few years since HOLMES was little known to the\r\ngeneral reader save as a humorist. A series of writings of the most\r\nvaried character have since appeared, displaying more fully his greatly\r\nvaried ability, so that the reader will not be surprised to find in\r\nthis, his last wreath of poetic blossoms, a rich variety of every hue,\r\nfrom the lightest tints of mirth to the sombre shades of tender pathos.\r\nThe variety of _feeling_ awakened by these lyrics is remarkable--and to\r\nsay that, is to bear sympathetic testimony to the excellence of each\r\nseparate piece. Even the beautiful ballad of 'Agnes,' chronicling the\r\nloves of Sir Harry Frankland and Agnes Surraige of the Hopkinton\r\nFrankland mansion, and which will be deemed one of the most perfect of\r\nnew ballads of the olden school, does not seem the chief flower, after\r\ninhaling the home sweetness and heart aroma of many of the minor lyrics\r\nin this volume. As for the humor, is it not of HOLMES? 'The\r\nDeacon's Masterpiece,' and 'Parson Turrell's Legacy,' are of the very\r\nbest, of the triple _est_ brand; it is only to be wished there were a\r\nhundred of them. Of that strange blending of pathos with humor, and the\r\n'sentiment of society,' in which HOLMES equals, or, if you\r\nwill, surpasses PRAED, there are several exquisite examples.\r\nBut buy it for yourself, reader, and you will not regret the purchase,\r\nfor the harder the times, so much the more, as we opine, does the world\r\nneed cheering poesy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS RECEIVED.\r\n\r\n     SOME OF THE MISTAKES OF EDUCATED MEN.

Price, 25 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was usual, of old, to characterize as _Annus Mirabilis_, or A Year of\r\nWonder, any twelvemonth which had been more than usually prolific in\r\nmarvels. The historian who may in future days seek a dividing point or a\r\ndate for the greatest political and social struggle of this age, can\r\nhardly fail to indicate 1861 as the _Annus Mirabilis_ of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury in America. That heart does not beat, the brain does not throb\r\non earth, which is capable of feeling or appreciating the tremendous\r\nrange of consequences involved in the events of this year. We hear the\r\nmost grating thunder-peals of horror; the whole artillery of death and\r\ndisaster roars and crashes from fort and field; there is blaze and ruin,\r\nsuch as this continent knew not perhaps even in the primeval times of\r\nits vanished Golden Hordes;--and again there rise prophetic organ-tones\r\nof solemn praise; merry bells ringing the carillon of joy; sweet voices\r\nas in dreams singing of the purple evening peace; while mysteriously and\r\nbeautifully, beyond all, breathes the Daughter of the Voice--that\r\nstrangest of prophecies known to the Hebrew of old, softly inspiring\r\nhopes of a fairer future America than was ever before dreamed of. For,\r\nof a truth, above all sits and works the awful destiny of man,\r\nproclaiming as of old, amid strange races now forgotten, that the\r\nhumanity which bravely toils and labors shall live, while the haughty\r\nand the oppressor and the sluggard, puffed up with vanity, shall all\r\npass away as the mist of the morning.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while, at the conclusion of such a year, to look about us;\r\nto see what has been done or what is now doing, and to surmise as well\r\nas we may what great changes the future may bring forth.\r\n\r\nA year ago this country was plagued and disgraced beyond any on the face\r\nof the earth by swarms of professional politicians; by men who regarded\r\nall legislation as one vast Lobby and Third House, and 'ability' as the\r\nmeans of turning corruption to their own personal advantage. These\r\nmiserables, whether on the Northern or Southern side, tacitly united in\r\ndriving all legislation or congressional business from its legitimate\r\nhalls into the procrastinating by-paths, in order that they might make\r\nspeeches and magnify themselves unto Buncombe, and be glorified by the\r\nlocal home press because of their devotion to--the party! The party!\r\nThat was always the word. Where are these men of froth and wind\r\nnow,--these heroes of the stump and the bar-room? Passing away into\r\nnothing, at headlong speed, before the great storm of the times. Now and\r\nthen they 'rally'--there was one ghastly wig-and-hollow-pumpkin effort\r\nat recovery in the trembling, rattle-jointed Peace Movement of these\r\nlast summer months. Where is it now? There answers a gay laugh and merry\r\nstave from the corners of irreverent weekly newspapers:--\r\n\r\n  'The piece of a party, called the party of peace,\r\n  Like everything else which deceases,\r\n  Has gone where the wicked from trouble shall cease,\r\n  For the party of peace is in pieces.'\r\n\r\nOr we may see now and then wretched election meetings, as of late in New\r\nYork, where a worn-out FERNANDO WOOD and others like him gabble\r\nas much treason as they dare. It is all played out--Mozart, Tammany,\r\nand all the trash. Rummy, frowsy candidates, treating Five-Point\r\ngraduates, and shoulder-hitting bravos yelling at the polls, are\r\nbeginning to be disgusting and anti-national elements. Their very\r\nexistence is an insult to these great, serious and glorious times of\r\nmanly war, when young men are beginning at last to 'think great.' A few\r\nmore gasps by the politicians and down they must go into infinite depths\r\nof congenial darkness, to be remembered only as allied to 'the\r\nabominable state of affairs before the war.'\r\n\r\nIt is no small thing to have driven so much of the old iniquity out; but\r\nfrom this and that side come murmurs that there are but few signs of the\r\nyoung genius coming in. Oh, for one hour of Dundee! Oh, for a WEBSTER in\r\nthe cabinet, whose right arm should go forth and take hold of England\r\nand Frank-land of the East, while his left swept the isles of the South\r\nwith fearful power! Oh, for the fierce old Dandolo of America, who was\r\n_not_ blind, but whose piercing glance at this hour would dart through\r\nmany a diabolical diplomatic difficulty--for ANDREW JACKSON! Oh, for the\r\ntrumpet tones of CLAY--of MARCY--for one brave blast of that dread horn\r\nof olden time which rang so bravely to battle!\r\n\r\nFriends, have patience. Remember that these men, and all like them, were\r\nslowly born of great times, and that we must await time's gestation. In\r\nthis age there spring no longer heroes dragon-tooth born into full\r\nfighting-life inside of 2.30. But so surely as stars shine in their\r\nrounding life, or water runs, or God lives, so surely are these days of\r\nstorm and sorrow and tremendous travail bringing slowly on their\r\nlegitimate fruit of great ideas and great men. Young man--whoever you\r\nare--be sacred to yourself now, and, for a season, serious and pure and\r\nnoble--for _who_ knows in these times to what he may grow? But a century\r\nago, this land lay buried in obscurity. Here and there young\r\nland-surveyors and country store-keepers wondered that destiny had\r\nburied them on Virginia farms and in Yankee backwoods. But war came,--no\r\ngreater than this of ours--one involving no grander principles of human\r\ndignity and freedom,--and the young 'obscures' darted to the heaven and\r\ntook glorious places amid the constellations of fame. 'When the tale of\r\nbricks is doubled,' says the Hebrew proverb, 'Moses comes.'\r\n\r\nWe hear much said of the honest, sturdy, no-nonsense virtues of the old\r\nrevolutionary stock, both male and female. The thing is plain\r\nenough--they had passed through serious times and great thoughts,\r\nthrough trials, and sorrows, and healthy privation, and come out strong.\r\nJust such will be the stock of men and women born in spirit of this war.\r\nIt is making the old material over again. It was all here as good as\r\never, but wanted a little stirring up, that was all. He who has seen in\r\nthe sturdy East and glorious West the unflinching honesty and\r\nearnestness with which men are upholding this war to the knife and knife\r\nto the hilt, as PALAFOX phrased it,--or, as the American hath\r\nit in humbler phrase, 'from the wheel to the hub and hub to the\r\nlinch-pin,'--has no doubt that at this minute it was never so popular,\r\nnever so determined, never so thoroughly ingrained, entwined,\r\ninter-twisted with the whole life-core and being of our people. 'We\r\nsuffer--but on with the war! Hurrah for battle--only give us victory! Do\r\nyou ask for money, arms, ships?--take all and everything to\r\nsuperfluity--but oh, give us victory and power!' Out of such will as\r\nthis there come the greatest of men--giants of a fearfully glorious\r\nfuture. When we look around and see this red-hot iron determination to\r\nsee all through to the victorious end, we may well feel assured that the\r\nday of great ideas and of great men is not far off.\r\n\r\nIt is superb for a stranger to see how the spirit of the Revolution\r\nstill lives in New England, and is voiced and acted by men bearing\r\nRevolutionary names--it is magnificent to behold the stream, grown to a\r\nthunder-torrent, roaring and foaming over the broad West. Hurrah! it\r\nstill lives--that old spirit of freedom, its fires are all aflame, and\r\nit shall not again smoulder until the whole world has seen, as it did\r\nbefore, that it is the light of the world, and the pillar guiding as of\r\nold to the promised land.\r\n\r\nIf 1861 had brought nothing else to pass it would be supremely great in\r\nthis, that amid toil and trial, foes within and without, it has seen the\r\nAmerican people determine that _Slavery_, the worm which gnawed the core\r\nof its tree of life, shall be plucked out. _Out it shall go_, that is\r\nsettled. We have fought the foe too long with kid gloves, but now puss\r\nwill lay aside her mittens and catch the Southern rats in earnest. It is\r\nthe negro who sustains the South; the negro who maintains its army,\r\nfeeds it, digs its trenches, squires its precious chivalry, and is\r\nthereby forced most unnaturally to rivet his own chains. There shall be\r\nan end to this, and our administration is yielding to this inevitable\r\nnecessity. Here again the great year has worked a wonder, since in so\r\nshort a space it has made such an advance in discovering a basis by\r\nwhich all Union men may conscientiously unite in freeing the black.\r\nThere have been hitherto two steps made towards the solution. The first\r\nwas that of the old Abolition movement, which saw only the suffering of\r\nthe slave and cried aloud for his freedom, reckless of all results. It\r\nwas humane; but even humanity is not always worldly wise, and it did\r\nunquestionably for twenty years defeat its own aim in the Border States.\r\nBut it _worked_ most unflinchingly. Then came HELPER, who saw\r\nthat the poor white man of the South was being degraded below the negro,\r\nand that industry and capital were fearfully checked by slavery. In his\r\nwell-known work he pointed out, by calm and dispassionate facts and\r\nfigures, that the land south of 'Mason and Dixon's' was being sacrificed\r\nmost wastefully, and the majority of its white inhabitants kept in\r\nincredible ignorance, meanness, and poverty, simply that a few\r\nprivileged families might remain 'first and foremost.' These opinions\r\nwere most clearly sustained, and the country was amazed. People began to\r\nask if it was quite right, after all, to suffer this slavery to grow and\r\ngrow, when it was manifestly reacting on the poor white man, and\r\nliterally sinking him _below the level of the black_. This was the\r\nsecond movement on the slave question, and its effect was startling.\r\n\r\nBut there was yet a third advance required, and it came with the past\r\nyear and the war, in the form of the now so rapidly expanding\r\n'Emancipation' movement. HELPER had shown that slavery had\r\ndegraded the poor whites, but the events leading to the present struggle\r\nindicated to all intelligent humanity that it was rapidly demoralizing\r\nand ruining in the most hideous manner the minds of the _masters_ of the\r\nslaves--nay, that its foul influence was spreading like a poison mist\r\nover the entire continent. The universal shout of joyful approbation\r\nwhich the whole South had raised years ago when a Northern senator was\r\nstruck down and beaten in the most infamously cowardly manner, had\r\ncaused the very horror of amazement at such fearful meanness, among all\r\ntrue hearted and manly _men_, the world over. But when there came from\r\nthe 'first families' grinnings of delight over the vilest thievery and\r\nforgery and perjury by FLOYD and his fellows,--when the whole\r\nSouth, after agreeing in carrying on an election, refused to abide by\r\nits results,--when the whole Southern press abounded in the vilest\r\ndenunciations of labor and poverty, and in Satanic contempt of\r\neverything 'Yankee,' meaning thereby all that had made the North and\r\nWest prosperous and glorious,--and when, finally, it was found that this\r\nloathsome poison was working through the North itself, corrupting the\r\nyoung with pseudo-aristocratic pro-slavery sympathies,--then indeed it\r\nbecame apparent that _for the sake of all, and for that of men in\r\ncomparison to whose welfare that of the negro was a mere trifle_, this\r\nfearful disease must be in some form abated. The result was the\r\ndevelopment of Emancipation on the broadest possible grounds,--of\r\nEmancipation for the sake of the Union and of the white man,--to be\r\nbrought about, however, by the will of the people, subject to such\r\nrules as discussion and expediency might determine. This was the present\r\nEmancipation movement, first urged by that name in the New York\r\n_Knickerbocker_ magazine, though its main principles were practically\r\nmanifesting themselves in many quarters--the most prominent being the\r\nwell-known proclamations of Generals BUTLER and FREMONT.\r\n\r\n'Emancipation' does not, as has been urged, present in comparison to\r\nAbolition a distinction without a difference. HELPER desired\r\nthe freedom of the slave for the sake of the poor white man in the South\r\nand for Southern development. _Emancipation_ goes further, and claims\r\nthat nowhere on the American continent is the white laborer free from\r\nthe vile comparison and vile influences of slavery, and that it should\r\nbe abolished for the sake of the Union and for the sake of _all_ white\r\nmen. It may be dim to many now, but it is true as God's providence, that\r\nwhether it be in our Union, or out of it, we can no longer exist side by\r\nside with a state of society in which it is shamelessly proclaimed that\r\nlabor, man's holiest and noblest attribute, is a disgrace; that the\r\nnegro is the standard of the mudsill, and that the state must be based\r\non an essentially degraded, sunken class, whether white or black. Yet we\r\nmight for the sake of peace have long borne with all this, and yielded\r\nto the old lie-based 'isothermal' cant, had it not resulted, as it\r\ninevitably must, in building up the most miserable, insolent, and\r\narrogant pseudo aristocracy which ever made the name of aristocracy\r\nridiculous, not excepting that of the court of the sable Emperor\r\nFAUSTIN of St. Domingo. It is all very well to talk of Southern\r\nrights; but humanity and progress, or, if you will, law and order,\r\nindustry and capital, have their rights also, aye, and their manifest\r\ndestiny too, and no one can deny that; reason as we may, or concede as\r\nmuch as we will, there the facts are--the principal being the utter\r\nimpossibility of a slave-aristocracy--rotted to the core with theories\r\nnow exploded through the civilized world--existing either in or out of a\r\nneighboring republic in which freedom\r\n\r\n  'Careers with thunder-speed along.'\r\n\r\nSo we stand at the parting of the ways. But the problem is half solved\r\nalready. The year 1861 closes leaving it clear as noon-day that\r\nemancipation in the Border States is a foregone conclusion, and that,\r\nreduced to the cotton belt, it can never become a preponderating\r\nnational influence. As for the details of settlement, calmly considered,\r\nthey present no real difficulty to the man who realizes the enormous\r\nindustrial and recuperative energies of this country.\r\n\r\n'What are we to do with one or two million of free blacks?' asks one. A\r\nfew years ago, when it was proposed to banish all free persons of color\r\nfrom Maryland, a cry of alarm went up lest Baltimore alone should be\r\ndeprived of fifteen thousand of 'the best servants in the world.' 'How\r\nshall we ever pay for those who may be offered for sale to us, if we\r\nresolve to pay for their slaves all Southerners who may take the oath of\r\nallegiance?' Eight days' expenses of the present war would pay more than\r\nthe market price for all the slaves in Maryland! But these objections\r\nare childish. Right against them rises a tremendous, inevitable destiny,\r\nwhich _must_ crush all before it. So much for 1861.\r\n\r\nWe would urge no measure in this or any other relation which shall not\r\nhave received the fullest endorsement of two thirds of the loyal\r\nAmerican people. As regards all foreign interference, let it never be\r\nforgotten that public opinion after all prevails in all Western Europe,\r\nand that this would long hesitate ere it committed a national reputation\r\nto an endorsement of the Southern Confederacy. It is apparent from the\r\nauthentic and shameless avowals of the Southern press that Mr.\r\nSLIDELL, the cut-short ambassador, was authorized to solicit a\r\nFrench protectorate of LOUIS NAPOLEON,--to such incredible\r\nbaseness has slave 'independence' sunk,--and, as we write, much\r\ndiscussion is waged whether England will take in ill part our arrest of\r\na man charged with such a monstrous mission! Let England imagine herself\r\ndependent on such a protectorate for her cotton, and the thought may\r\npossibly occur that it would have been better to have sided at once\r\nopenly and squarely with the North. But John Bull is strangely changed\r\nin these times, and Yankee protection is inconceivably more awful to him\r\nthan the slavery with which he has been for twenty years so much\r\ndisgusted.\r\n\r\n  'The heart it pincheth sore,\r\n  But the pocket pinches more.'\r\n\r\nAnd now with the New Year. Amid red-flashing war and wild strivings we\r\nlook bravely and hopefully forward into the future, and see amid these\r\nstorms blue sky rifts and golden sun gleams. Already strong and\r\npractical advances in education, in political economy, in industry, in\r\nall that is healthier and sounder in life, are beginning to manifest\r\nthemselves. This country can be in nothing put back by this struggle, in\r\nno wise weakened or injured. It is our hope and will that in these\r\ncolumns some share of the good work may be honestly carried out. We wish\r\nto speak under the most vital American influences to the American\r\npeople, ambitious of being nothing more nor less than soundly national\r\nin all things. We see a new time forming, new ideas rising, and would\r\ngive it and them a voice in such earnest and energetic tones as the\r\npeople love. We call not only for the matured thought, but also for the\r\nyoung mind of the country, and beg every man and woman who entertains\r\nvigorous and practical ideas to come out boldly and speak freely. Think\r\nnobly, write rapidly! Remember that every letter printed in these times\r\nwill take its place in history. The forgotten comment of the moment will\r\nrise up in after years to be honored perhaps as the right word in the\r\nright place. The day is coming when the songs and sentences of this\r\ngreat struggle will be garnered up into literary treasuries, pass into\r\nhousehold words, and confer honor on the children of those who penned\r\nthem. Lay hand to the work, all you who have aught to say, aid us to\r\nbecome a medium for the time, and honor yourselves by your utterances.\r\nThere are a thousand reforms, innumerable ideas fit for the day, ready\r\nto bloom forth. Write and publish; the public is listening. Now is the\r\ntime, if it ever was, to develop an American character, to show the\r\nworld what treasures of life, strength and originality this country\r\ncontains. Beyond the old conventional _belles lettres_ and æsthetic\r\nscholarship which limited us in peace, lies a fair land, a wilderness it\r\nmay be, but one bearing beautiful, unknown flowers, and strange but\r\ngolden fruits, which are well worthy a garden. Let all who know of these\r\nbring them in. The time has come.\r\n\r\nWe have been questioned from many of the highest sources as to the\r\nfuture tendency and scope of our magazine. Let us say then, briefly,\r\nthat we hope to make a bold step forward, presenting in our columns\r\ncontributions characterized by variety, vigor, and originality, to be\r\nwritten by men who are fully up with the times and endeavoring to\r\nadvance in all things. In a word, we shall do our best to give it\r\nexuberant _life_--such as the country and age require. We shall advocate\r\nthe holy cause of the UNION with might and main, and leave no\r\nmeans whatever neglected to urge the most vigorous prosecution of this\r\nwar, until the sacred principles of liberty as transmitted to us by our\r\nforefathers have been fully recognized and re-established. Believing in\r\nEmancipation, subject to the will of the majority and the action of the\r\nadministration, we shall still welcome to our pages the properly\r\nexpressed views of _every_ sound 'Union man' or woman on this or other\r\nsubjects, however differing from our own. We shall urge the fullest\r\ndevelopment of education as the great basis of future social progress,\r\nand shall have faith in making woman's intellect and labor as available\r\nas possible in all respects. We shall hold to the belief that in\r\nconstant industrial development, the increase of capital, and the\r\nharmony of interests between these, lies the material salvation of the\r\ncountry, and that labor in every form should be continually ennobled and\r\nsocially dignified.\r\n\r\nWe shall, moreover, look with true love to all that art and beauty in\r\ntheir manifold forms can supply to render life lovely and pleasant, and\r\nwelcome all that can be written in their illustration. Our columns will\r\nnever be deficient in tales, poetry and sketches, and that nothing may\r\nbe neglected, we shall always devote full room to genial gossip with the\r\nreader, and to such original humors, quips, jests and anecdotes as\r\nchance or the kindness of correspondents may supply. And we would here\r\nentreat all our readers to be good friends and at home with us;\r\nregarding the editorial department as a place of cheerful welcome for\r\nanything which they may choose to commune on; in which all confidences\r\nwill be kept, and where all courtesies will be honorably acknowledged.\r\nWe have received most abundant and cordial promises of assistance and\r\nsupport in our effort to maintain a thoroughly spirited, 'wide-awake,'\r\nand vigorous American magazine, from the very first in the land, and\r\ntherefore go on our way rejoicing. We enter into no rivalry, for we take\r\na well-nigh untrodden field, and shall fail in our dearest hope unless\r\nwe present the public with a monthly of a thoroughly original and\r\n'go-ahead' character. We are told that these are bad times; but for our\r\nundertaking, as we understand it, there could be none better--for it\r\nshall be made for the times, 'timely and temporal in all things.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a correspondent for the following comment on a\r\nsubject which has thus far excited not a little wonder, and which, as\r\nthe loyal reader may be disposed to add, _should_ excite some degree of\r\nvigorous inquiry among the people at large. Like every other practical\r\npoint involved in this struggle, it suggests the mortifying truth that\r\nwith all our sacrifices, and all our patriotism, we are as yet in the\r\nconduct of the war far too amiable, and by far too irresolute.\r\n\r\n     WANTED, A FOUCHÉ FOR WASHINGTON.--It is high time that a\r\n     good, sharp detective police officer was set to work to discover\r\n     the source of the continued leakage of our government's plans. Of\r\n     our late naval flotilla for Beaufort, we are told that 'The\r\n     positive destination of our fleet was known even in New Orleans on\r\n     the 17th ult.,--weeks before it was known in the North! and extra\r\n     troops were dispatched from points south of Charleston to defend\r\n     the approaches of that coast.' We are informed that every care was\r\n     exercised to prevent the destination of the expedition being made\r\n     public; with how much effect the above quoted paragraph fully\r\n     demonstrates. In view of this, I repeat that a FOUCHÉ, a\r\n     keen detective, is wanted at head-quarters; believing that any man\r\n     with half the shrewdness of the celebrated 'Duke of Otranto' would\r\n     pin the traitor in less than twenty-four hours. That such a man can\r\n     easily be found, any one who has learned what American detectives\r\n     have done, can readily believe. Active, intelligent, and wide\r\n     awake, the American who by necessity takes up this life, brings to\r\n     bear upon his investigations the shrewdness of a savage, the\r\n     tenacity of an Englishman, and, in a modified degree, the _aplomb_\r\n     of a Parisian. No one can read POE'S 'Murder of the Rue\r\n     Morgue' without recognizing at a glance the latent talent that\r\n     would have made of the cloudy poet a brilliant policeman, and would\r\n     have won for him the ducal fortune without the empty title. If we\r\n     must handle the Southern mutineers in their Rebelutionary war with\r\n     a velvet glove, let there be an iron hand inside, worked by the\r\n     high-pressure power of public indignation at their treachery and\r\n     faithlessness. We should stop this leakage of our plans, cost what\r\n     it may, and the traitorous Southern correspondent meet the\r\n     execration of ARNOLD, and the fate of ANDRÉ. The\r\n     iron hand should stop the treacherous pen, should choke the wagging\r\n     tongue. The North demands it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again, since the above was penned, we learn that it has been\r\nascertained by a balloon reconnaissance that a projected flank movement,\r\nplanned by General McCLELLAN and confided to a very limited number, had\r\nbeen completely anticipated--indicating the basest treachery in a high\r\nquarter. Very agreeable this to all interested in the war! And what does\r\nit mean?\r\n\r\nIt means that Washington, and not Washington alone, but the entire\r\nNorth, needs purging and purifying from most injurious influences. There\r\nare traitors among us everywhere--where two or three are gathered\r\ntogether will be one who sneers at Northern successes, smiles at\r\nSouthern victory, and is a traitor at heart--ready to be a spy if\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that warm friends of the Union sometimes burst out into\r\nindignant remonstrance and fierce complaint at such toleration!\r\n\r\nStill, we must look at the matter philosophically; rather in sorrow than\r\nin anger, for thus only can we correct the evil. There is a large number\r\nof well-meaning people, especially in Washington, who have lived only\r\nfor and in a society in which Southern influence greatly predominated.\r\nFamiliar with the wildest excitement of politics, yet accustomed to\r\nregard the leaders of all parties as equally unprincipled, and only\r\npersuaded of the single social fact, that it is highly respectable to\r\nown slaves, they can not see, even in the horrors of war, anything more\r\nthan the old excitement, in which shrewd and wily politicians continue\r\nto pull wires. And in many other places besides Washington do the voices\r\nof pleasant interests, or the echoes of pleasant memories, recall old\r\nfriendships or old ties. The head may be patriotic and union-loving and\r\nat war with the South, but the heart is peaceful and clings to ancient\r\nmemories.\r\n\r\nNow, if there is anything, dear reader, which is allied to real\r\ngoodness, it is this very same soft-heartedness which we find it so hard\r\nto thoroughly condemn, even in such a case as that of the good Scotch\r\nclergyman, who pitied and prayed for 'the poor auld deevil' himself. But\r\nhere it is that the 'gallant Southron' has the advantage over us. No\r\nlingering love for Northern friends of olden time, no kindly regard for\r\nby-gone intimacies, flashes up from the darkened abyss of 'Dixey.' And,\r\nto be frank and fair, reader, does it not seem to you that while the\r\nbusiness in hand is literal _fighting_, not without much 'battle, murder\r\nand sudden death,' it would be at least respectful to the awful destiny\r\nof the hour to treat its ways seriously?\r\n\r\nBut let it foam and surge on, the time is coming when the great stream\r\nof Northern freedom will purify itself from all the foul stains of its\r\nold stagnation. Perhaps years may be required, but this we know,--that\r\nthe dam has been broken away at last, and that now the glad torrent\r\nwhirls bravely onward in sparkling young life. For at length the time is\r\ncoming when a healthy _Northern_ sentiment shall make itself felt, where\r\nof old it was carefully excluded, and the fresh breeze from the Northern\r\npines shall purify the sickly air. They will pass away, these of the old\r\ngeneration--there will arise better ones to take their place, and all\r\nshall be changed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for all our late great victories and advances, let us be\r\nthankful! not forgetting the smaller crumbs of comfort--as, for\r\ninstance, the capture of SLIDELL, MASON and Co., which a friend\r\nhas kindly recorded for your benefit, most excellent reader, in the\r\nfollowing chapter:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONICLES OF SECESSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass in the first year of the great Rebellion\r\n\r\nIn the land of Secessia, whose men were men of Belial, hard of heart,\r\nand inflamed with exceeding great wrath against the children of the\r\nNorth, and against all people who walked in the way of truth and\r\njustice:\r\n\r\nMeditating evil from the first mint-julep before breakfast, even unto\r\nthe last nip of corn whisky before retiring;--\r\n\r\nIn the isles of the South, and on the firm land, where COTTON was king,\r\nand JEFFERSON, whose surname was DAVIS, was his prophet; where BENJAMIN,\r\nthe finder of stray watches and spoons, and FLOYD, the spoiler, were\r\npriests--Oh, my soul, enter thou not into their counsels!--\r\n\r\nLo! it came to pass that there arose a great cry from among the people;\r\n\r\nA great and vehement cry, a wailing and roaring as of many of the\r\nchivalry when they burn with strong drink at quarter races, or smite\r\nwith bowie-knives in a free fight around the court-house:\r\n\r\nThe cry of many women and children, to say nothing of editors,\r\npoliticians, dirt-eaters, and negro auctioneers:\r\n\r\nSaying, 'Lo! these many days have we been closed up by the Yankees, even\r\nlike unto a pint of Bourbon in an exceedingly tight-corked bottle, so\r\nthat nothing may go out or in, and who shall say what may be the end\r\nthereof?\r\n\r\n'Since the blockade presseth sorely upon our ports, the merchandise of\r\nmany lands cometh not therein, and we are entirely out of groceries.\r\n\r\n'Having neither balm nor myrrh, spices nor tea, coffee nor brandy.\r\n\r\n'Quinine is not among us, neither have we cheese, shoes, sugar,\r\njack-knives, cigars, patent medicines, glue, tenpenny nails, French\r\ngloves, pens or ink, dye-stuffs, nor raisins.\r\n\r\n'Clothes are exceeding scarce, for, lo! we are becoming an extremely\r\nragged and seedy generation; our toes stick out through our last year's\r\nboots, neither is there any one among us who knoweth enough to make the\r\nfirst principle of a brogan.\r\n\r\n'For all these things were made or imported by the Yankees afore-time,\r\neven since the days of our fathers, and we are too proud to defile our\r\nhands with such base labor.\r\n\r\n'Shall we, too, be as dogs cobbling shoes, or as the heathen who sell\r\nrat-traps, peddle milk-pails, and keep Thanksgiving?\r\n\r\n'Lo! the kings of the earth see us with scorn; those who sit in high\r\nplaces wag their heads, and say we are naught, yea, polluted in our\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n'And the _Times_ will declare that we sit in ashes; even the _Moniteur_\r\nwill say that we devour dust, and the _Zeitungs_ of all Germany, even\r\nthe press of the Philistines, will proclaim that we are utterly fallen.\r\n\r\n'Now let there be a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together,\r\nto settle this business.\r\n\r\n'Let there be ambassadors--men of subtle tongue, cunning in\r\ncounsel--chosen to go forth; yea, let them be equipped in fine raiment,\r\nhaving bran-new coats to confer honor and glory upon us, with\r\nsecretaries and assistant secretaries, sub-secretaries and\r\ndeputy-assistant sub-secretaries,--even these having their servants and\r\nservants' servants,--lo, the least among them shall have his underling,\r\nand so on _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\n'And we, albeit poor, will lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver\r\nin the balance, and hire a goldsmith, who shall bedeck them exceeding\r\nfine, so that the princes and potentates shall fall down before them,\r\nyea, shall worship.\r\n\r\n'Then, when our great embassy cometh, and the princes inquire of the\r\nblockade, lo, our messengers shall laugh and say, \"Go to!--it is naught,\r\nit hath passed away, and is bosh.\"'\r\n\r\n'\"Are we not here, ready to declare the end from the beginning, and\r\nfrom ancient times, even of CALHOUN, the things that are not\r\nyet done, saying, 'our counsel shall stand?' Verily, it takes us, and we\r\nare the original Jacobs, having no connection with the bogus concern\r\nover the way.\"\r\n\r\n'And they shall cotton to us, and we unto them; and we will trade our\r\ntobacco for their wines, and _Pro Baccho Tobacco_ shall be written in\r\nall the high places.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nNow JEFFERSON, whose surname should have been Brick, but that\r\nit was not, seeing that it was DAVIS.\r\n\r\nSaw the counsel that it was good.\r\n\r\nAnd having seen it, and set his eyes upon the egg which their wisdom had\r\nhatched, and pronounced it a good egg;\r\n\r\nChose him of his chief men two, whereof the like were not to be\r\nfound--no, not in all the North, and in the South was not their equal.\r\n\r\nWhereof the first was a MASON, the like of whom was not known,\r\nnot in the land of Huram of old, nor among the Hittites or the dwellers\r\nby the sea.\r\n\r\nFor he was like unto a turkey-cock, stuck up and of excessive pride,\r\nspreading himself and strutting vehemently from the rising of the sun\r\neven unto the going down of the same; ineffably great in his own\r\nconceit, swelling in vanity, puffed up like a bladder even nigh unto\r\nbursting;\r\n\r\nSo that the little ones in the market-place cried after him, 'Big\r\nInjiun, heap big!'\r\n\r\nAnd the other was a 'little' New Yorker, even a renegade of the North,\r\none who had backslidden from the ways of his fathers, and that right\r\nill. Wherefore he was called SLIDE-ILL. Howbeit some termed him\r\nSLY-DEAL, from his dealings both with cards and with men.\r\n\r\nBut it came to pass that they called him SLIDELL, forasmuch as\r\nthat he was one who naturally took the whole ell, whether one gave him\r\nan inch or no.\r\n\r\nNow they packed their trunks, and took unto them 'poor EUSTIS,'\r\nand many others equally talented and important.\r\n\r\nNot forgetting their wives, neither their man-servants nor their\r\nmaid-servants, their wines nor their cigars.\r\n\r\nHowbeit they took not with them the bonds of the Confederacy, lest the\r\nParis shop-keepers should say, 'Go to--it is naught;'\r\n\r\nBut divers eagles and dimes, stolen afore-time from UNCLE SAM,\r\ntook they. Likewise bills of exchange and circular letters of credit\r\nupon certain of the Jews.\r\n\r\nAnd so they went down unto the sea in ships,--even in a\r\nsteam-ship,--sailing to the Havana, where she was unladed of her burden.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n[THE SONG OF REJOICING.]\r\n\r\nNow when the ambassadors, and they which bore the words of the king, had\r\nsailed.\r\n\r\nLo, there was great rejoicing in all Secessia,--there was naught heard\r\nsave the voices of renegade Northern editors,--[for that the Southerners\r\nknow not to write],--\r\n\r\nSaying, 'Come, let us be glad; laugh, O thou my soul.\r\n\r\n'For they have gone, they have escaped, they have got away, they have\r\ndodged, they have cut stick, they have vamosed the ranch.\r\n\r\n'They have ripped it full chisel, they are off licketty-split, they have\r\nslid, they have made tracks, they have mizzled--they have absquatulated\r\nand clipped it; _abiit, evasit, crupit_! Hurrah for us!\r\n\r\n'Lo, the Yankees are brought low--the nasty, mercenary, low-born,\r\ninfernal mudsills are defiled, and become as a vain thing. _Gloria_!\r\n\r\n'For our messengers are on the high seas; they are O.K.; they\r\nshall deliver us from the pit. _Victoria_!\r\n\r\n'They will drive things chuck to the hub in slasher-gaff style; our foes\r\nshall become even as dead birds in the pit; they shall be euchred, and\r\ndiscounted, and we will rake down the pot.\r\n\r\n'Come, let us take drinks, for who shall stand against us?'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that when UNCLE SAMUEL heard of these\r\nthings, he was sorely riled; yea, his wrath was like unto a six-story\r\nstack of wolverines and wild-cats, mixed with sudden death and patent\r\nchain-lightning.\r\n\r\nHowbeit he lost no time, and tarried not to take a long swear over the\r\nbusiness,\r\n\r\nBut sent forth his ships:\r\n\r\nSending likewise THURLOW, whose surname was WEED, to\r\nprevail over MASON and SLY-DEAL, and come vitriol over\r\ntheir vinegar.\r\n\r\nBut when the people heard THURLOW say, 'I go, indeed, unto\r\nEurope, but not on this business--SLIDELL may slide for aught I\r\ncare,'\r\n\r\nThen the multitude winked one unto the other, so that such terrible\r\nwinking was never before seen,\r\n\r\nExclaiming, 'Oh, yes--in a horn. We knew it not before, but now we know\r\nit for certain.'\r\n\r\nAnd a certain SIMEON, whose surname was DRAPER, stood\r\nup in the market-place and wagered that THURLOW would pull the\r\nwool over Mason, and humble him;\r\n\r\nAnd there were no takers. _Selah_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nNow there was a valiant captain, a man of war, hating all iniquity even\r\nas poison.\r\n\r\nAnd his name was WILKES--honor and praise to it in all lands!--\r\n\r\nCaptain of the San Jacinto, cruising for a pirate on the high seas, even\r\nfor the Sumter.\r\n\r\nAnd he came from Africa, even from the East unto the Havana, in an isle\r\nof the sea which lieth under the tower of the Moro;\r\n\r\nWhere he heard from his Consul strange news, saying that MASON\r\nand SLIDELL had sailed in a British steamer, even the Trent,\r\nwhich saileth between Vera Cruz, Havana, and St. Thomas.\r\n\r\nThen said the captain, 'Shall I refrain myself to stop this iniquity?\r\n\r\n'Arise, oh my soul, gird thyself, and go forth; tarry not, but nab them\r\nin their wickedness.\r\n\r\n'Take them where the hair is short; jerk them, and pull them even as the\r\nfancy policeman pulleth the pickpocket when he seeth him picking the\r\npocket of the righteous.\r\n\r\n'Shall I hold back my hand when my country calleth? Not if I know it.\r\n_Selah_.\r\n\r\n'Up steam and after them, oh my soul; let there be coal under the\r\nboilers, oh my heart; let the way in which we shall travel be a caution,\r\nfaster than Flora Temple or any other man.\r\n\r\n'Fling forth the stripes and stars--hoist the rag, thou galiant sailior;\r\ngo it strong as it can be mixed. For the star-spangled banner in triumph\r\nshall wave o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass at the end of the first day that they saw the Trent\r\nin the Bermudas, even in the channel.\r\n\r\nThen the brave captain sent on board Lieutenant FAIRFAX,--which\r\nin the Norse tongue is Harfager or Fair-Haired; since it runneth in the\r\nfamily to be sea-kings, and brave on the ocean.\r\n\r\nAnd he, mounting the ship, cried aloud, 'Where are they?'\r\n\r\nThen the Englishman replied, 'I know not whom ye seek,--lo, they are not\r\nhere!'\r\n\r\nThen he, seeing MASON a little apart, cried, 'Lo! here he is.'\r\n\r\nAnd MASON, hearing this, turned to the color of ashes; his\r\nknees smote together; he became even as a boiled turkey-cock; there was\r\nno soul left in him.\r\n\r\nYea, even his collar wilted, and the stock of his heart went down\r\nninety-five per cent.\r\n\r\nHowbeit he said, with Slidell, 'We will not go save we be forced.'\r\n\r\n'Then' replied FAIRFAX, 'I shall take you by force.'\r\n\r\nSo they held a council together, and resolved to go.\r\n\r\nBut their wives and little ones they sent on to Europe, and gave\r\ninstructions to poor EUSTIS.\r\n\r\nBidding him go in when it should rain, and be sure and put up his\r\numbrella if he had one.\r\n\r\nLikewise to bear certain documents promptly and speedily to the kings\r\nand princes;\r\n\r\nWhich WILKES hearing, he speedily smashed, taking poor\r\nEUSTIS with the papers.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of the Council of Trent. It was not that great council\r\nof the name, but a very small one, and which came to nothing--small\r\npotatoes, and few in a hill. Selah!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nNow it had come to pass years before, and was on record,\r\n\r\nThat MASON, having been asked to visit Boston,\r\n\r\nReplied, 'Verily, verily, I say unto you that I will not set foot\r\ntherein again save as an ambassador to that land.'\r\n\r\nNow these things were remembered against him, and printed in all the\r\npapers, even in the Boston papers printed they them.\r\n\r\nAnd they bare him into prison, with SLIDELL, and poor\r\nEUSTIS was he borne of them.\r\n\r\nAnd they seemed extremely wamble-cropt and chop-fallen; their feathers\r\nshone not, even their sickle-feathers drooped in the dust, and their\r\ncombs were white.\r\n\r\nAnd they seemed as unclean men caught in their unrighteousness, who had\r\nbeen sold uncommonly cheap, with nary buyer.\r\n\r\nAnd they took from them the gold which they had stolen afore-time from\r\nUNCLE SAM, even the bills upon the Hebrews did they yield up.\r\nHowbeit, they received a receipt for them.\r\n\r\nAnd they asked much, 'How shall we feed, and may we have servants?' and\r\nwished to live pleasantly; yet, when at Richmond, SLIDELL had\r\nreviled the Yankee prisoners sorely, and counseled harsh treatment.\r\n\r\nThen went they into the jug, and were allotted each man his bunk in the\r\nprison-house.\r\n\r\nAnd the word went forth to hang all pirates and robbers on the sea, even\r\nas it had been spoken sternly by OLD ABE, of Washington;\r\n\r\nSaying, string them up in short order.\r\n\r\nAnd if they of Secessia hang the brave CORCORAN and his\r\nfriends,\r\n\r\nThen, as the LORD liveth, SLIDELL and MASON\r\nshall pull hemp; even on the gallows shall they hang like thieves and\r\nmurderers--the land hath sworn it. SELAH!\r\n\r\n\r\n'SOUND on the Goose Question.'\r\n\r\nWho is there among our readers who has not heard that phrase? It has now\r\nfor some years been transferred from one political topic to another,\r\nuntil its flavor of novelty is well-nigh gone. But _whence_ the\r\nexpression? An antiquarian would probably hint at the geese whose sound\r\nsaved Rome. The great goose question of the Reformation was the burning\r\nof one Huss, whose name in English signifyeth Goose, for which reason he\r\nis said to have exclaimed to his tormentors 'Now ye indeed roast a\r\ngoose, but, lo! after me there will come a swan whom ye can not roast;'\r\nwhich was strangely fulfilled in LUTHER, whose name--slightly\r\nvaried--signifies in Bohemian a swan. But, reader, 'an it please you,'\r\nhere is the original and 'Simon Pure' explanation, as furnished by a\r\ncorrespondent:--\r\n\r\n     'Are you right on the goose question?' But do you know the origin\r\n     of the phrase? It was told to me, at Harrisburg, in Pennsylvania,\r\n     when I was there in \"Fremont's time,\" _anno_ 1856. Alas! the fates\r\n     deal hardly with Fremont. C. and F., now a satellite of C., helped\r\n     to slaughter him once before in Pennsylvania--sold him out to\r\n     Know-Nothings. Hope they haven't now in Missouri pitched him over\r\n     to be succeeded by Do-Nothings. But to the story. Harrisburg has\r\n     wide, clean, brick sidewalks. Many of the poorer sort there kept\r\n     geese years ago, and sold or ate their progeny in the days of\r\n     November and December--the \"_embers_ of the dying year.\" Jenkins\r\n     was up for constable. The question whether geese should run at\r\n     large was started. The Harrisburg geese made at times bad work on\r\n     the clean sidewalks, as do their examplars, spitting on the _pave_\r\n     of Broadway. A delegation of the geese-owners waited on Jenkins.\r\n     Seeing that they had many votes, he declared himself in favor of\r\n     the geese running at large. The better sort of people, who were in\r\n     favor of clean sidewalks, hearing of this, set up an opposition\r\n     candidate, who avowed himself opposed to having the sidewalks\r\n     fouled by these errant fowls. The canvass waxed warm; a third\r\n     candidate took the field; he put himself in the hands of an astute\r\n     \"trainer\" for the political fray. We don't know whether or not this\r\n     was before the day when Mr. Cameron counseled in politics at\r\n     Harrisburg, but his Mentor bid this new candidate, when the\r\n     delegations applied for his views on the all-absorbing issues, to\r\n     say nothing himself, but to refer to him, the Mentor aforesaid. And\r\n     when the delegations accordingly came to Mentor to find the\r\n     position of the third candidate, he said to each, with unction,\r\n     \"You will find my friend sound on the goose question.\" Third\r\n     candidate was elected. His story got wind, and from that day till\r\n     Bull Run all the politicians of the land have striven likewise to\r\n     be 'sound on the goose question.'\r\n\r\nTherefore let us be duly thankful that the time hath come when it shall\r\nno longer advantage a man to say, 'Lo! I am sound,' or--as PRINCE\r\nALBERT was reported to reply constantly to his royal consort during\r\nthe early years of their marriage--'I dinks joost as _you_\r\ndinks,'--since in these--days vigorous _acts_ and not quibbling words\r\nare the only coin which shall pass current in politics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNever was there an institution which required such constant repairing as\r\n'the great Southern system.' One of the latest and most terrible leaks\r\ndiscovered is that of the danger to be apprehended from an influx of\r\nvile Yankee immigrants after the North shall have been conquered. Unless\r\nthis is prevented, say the Charleston papers, who dictate pretty\r\nindependently to the whole of Dixie, we shall have sacrificed in vain\r\nour blood and treasure, since nothing is more evident than that at no\r\ndistant day the Northern men among us will be fully able to control our\r\nelections. Therefore it is proposed that no Northern man ever be allowed\r\nthe right of naturalization in the South.\r\n\r\nBut as even Southern injustice has not as yet the insolence to restrict\r\nthis precious prohibition to 'Yankees,' it is sequentially proposed that\r\nwith the exception of those foreigners now in the South, no person, not\r\na (white) native, shall ever, after this war, be allowed the rights of\r\ncitizenship in the C. S. A. There has not been, that we are aware, any\r\nopposition to this hospitable proposition, but, on the contrary, it has\r\nbeen most largely circulated and approved of.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the South is in one thing at least\r\npraiseworthy. It is consistent--to say nothing of being thoroughly in\r\nearnest. To exclude all poor white immigrants from civil, and\r\nconsequently social privileges, is perfectly in keeping with its long\r\nexpressed contempt for mudsills. It legislates for F. F.'s, and for them\r\nalone. It wants no Irish, no Germans, no foreign element of any\r\ndescription between itself and the negro. It will make unto itself a\r\nChina within a wall of cotton-bales, and be sublimely magnificent within\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBut what of the Border, or, as GEO. SAUNDERS aptly called them,\r\nthe Tobacco States? (By the by, where is now that eminent rejected of\r\nthe C. S. A.?) The Patent Office Report for 1852 spoke as follows of\r\nFairfax County, Virginia, where thousands of acres of land have become\r\nexhausted through slave labor, abandoned as worthless, and reduced to a\r\nwilderness:--\r\n\r\n     'These lands have been purchased by Northern emigrants, the large\r\n     tracts divided and subdivided and cleared of pines, and neat\r\n     farm-houses and barns, with smiling fields of grain and grass in\r\n     the season, salute the delighted gaze of the beholder. Ten years\r\n     ago it was a mooted question whether Fairfax lands could be made\r\n     productive, and if so, would they pay the cost? This problem has\r\n     been satisfactorily solved by many, and in consequence of the above\r\n     altered state of things, school-houses and churches have doubled in\r\n     number.'\r\n\r\nBut school-houses and churches are not what the C. S. A. want. 'Let us\r\nalone with your Yankee contrivances. \"Smiling fields indeed!\"--we want\r\nno smiling among us save the \"smiles\" of old Monongahela or Bourbon. The\r\nfiery Southern heart does not condescend to smile. \"Neat farm-houses!\"\r\nThey may do for your Northern serfs--we'll none of them.' Verily the C.\r\nS. A. is a stupendous power, which, according to the development of its\r\nown avowed principles, must necessarily become greater as it is more and\r\nmore limited to fewer persons. In due time these will be reduced to\r\nhundreds, those in time to scores, until, finally, all Southerndom shall\r\nbe merged in one individual quintessentially concentrated exponent of\r\nCottondom, who must needs be, perforce, so intensely respectable and so\r\nsublimely aristocratic that Northern eye may not see nor Northern heart\r\nfeel the magnitude of his superiority, or pierce the gloom wherein he\r\nshall sit, 'a sceptred hermit, wrapped in the solitude of his own\r\noriginality.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive of the present Cabinet, with Secretary CAMERON at their\r\nhead, have expressed themselves fairly and fully in favor of\r\nEmancipation,--foreseeing its inevitable realization, and, we presume,\r\nthe necessity of 'managing' it betimes. Only Messrs. SEWARD and\r\nBATES hang timidly behind, waiting for stronger manifestations,\r\nere they hang out their flags. Meanwhile, from the rural districts of\r\nthe East and West come thousand-fold indications that the great 'working\r\nmajority' of Northern freemen--the same who elected LINCOLN and\r\nurged on the war in thunder-tones and lightning acts--are sternly\r\ndetermined to press the great measure, and purify this country for once\r\nand forever of its great bitterness. It is a foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'If you would know what your neighbors think of you,' says an old\r\nproverb, 'quarrel with them.' It has not been necessary of late to\r\nquarrel with England to ascertain _her_ opinion of us, as expressed by\r\nher editors, writers, and men of the highest standing. Our war with the\r\nSouth has brought it out abundantly, and the result is a great dislike\r\nof everything American, save cotton! We are not of those who would at\r\nthis time say too much on the subject,--every expression of Anglophobia\r\nis just now nuts to the C. S. A., who would dearly relish a war between\r\nus and the mother country,--but we may point to the significant fact\r\nrecently laid in a laconic letter by 'Railway TRAIN,' that\r\nwhile everything is done in England to preserve a 'strict neutrality,'\r\nas regards the North, and while the most vexatious hinderances are\r\nplaced in the way of exporting aught which may aid us,--much\r\n_gratuitous_ pains being taken to prevent any material aid to the\r\nFederal government,--vessels are allowed to load openly with all\r\ncontraband of war, even to arms and ammunition, for the avowed purpose\r\nof supplying the South. This is not mere _rumor_--it has been amply\r\nconfirmed for months.\r\n\r\nVery well, gentlemen; very well, indeed. We may remember all your\r\nkindness and the depth of your zealous abolition philanthropy. '_Haud\r\nimmemor._' But you are reasoning on false grounds. You forget that it is\r\nalmost as important for you to self your manufactures to America as to\r\nget cotton from it. And articles in the _Times_, and speeches from your\r\nfirst statesmen, show that you really believe the enormous fib so\r\ngenerally current, that the South consumes the very great majority of\r\nall our imports. 'The South is where the North makes all its money--the\r\nSouth does everything.'\r\n\r\nDo not believe it. The entire South consumes only about one sixth or\r\nseventh of all Imports, and contributes no greater proportion to the\r\nwealth of the North. But the North, with a very little sacrifice, can\r\nfree itself almost entirely from dependence on your manufactures, and\r\nif, in homely parlance, you 'give us any more of your impudence,' she\r\n_will_--will most decidedly. There is even a stronger king than Cotton\r\nhere; we may call him King Market. Let King Market once lay hands on\r\nyou, and whereas you were before only broken, _then_ you will be ground\r\nto powder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOver many a home since the last New Year, Death has cast the shadow,\r\nwhich may grow dimmer with time, or change to other hues, but which\r\nnever entirely departs. But now he comes with strange, unwonted form,\r\nfor he comes from the battle-field as well as the far-off home of fever,\r\nor the icy lair of consumption, and those left behind know only of the\r\ndeparted that he died for honor.\r\n\r\n'My brother! oh, my brother!' Such a cry arose not long ago in a family,\r\nfor one of the best and bravest whom this country has ever known. And\r\nmore than one has brought back from the war a sorrowful narrative of a\r\nlong farewell inclosed in as brief and touching words as those of the\r\nfollowing lyric:--\r\n\r\n\r\nLINES.\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  My brother, take my hand;\r\n    The darkness covers me,\r\n    And now I fly to thee;\r\n      O, hear my call!\r\n\r\n  II.\r\n\r\n  My brother, take my hand;\r\n    Weary, and sick, and faint,\r\n    To thee I make complaint,\r\n      Who art my all.\r\n\r\n  III.\r\n\r\n  My brother, take my hand;\r\n    Though pale it is and thin,\r\n    The same blood flows within\r\n      That is in thine.\r\n\r\n  IV.\r\n\r\n  My brother, take my hand;\r\n    It's all I have to give;\r\n    O, let me, while I live,\r\n      Press it to thine.\r\n\r\n  V.\r\n\r\n  My brother, take my hand;\r\n    And with the hand receive\r\n    The blessing which I leave,\r\n      Before I die.\r\n\r\n  VI.\r\n\r\n  My brother, take my hand;\r\n    And when at last you come,\r\n    I will receive you home,--\r\n      The home on high.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA correspondent in Ohio sends us the following:--\r\n\r\n     'It is a good thing for a weak brother to have faith; and some one\r\n     to rely on is to such an especial blessing. Squire BULLARD\r\n     was wont to find such a prop in his friend Deacon PARRISH,\r\n     who, he firmly believed, \"knew everything.\"\r\n\r\n     'Near by the Squire lived a graceless old infidel named\r\n     MYERS, who was wont to entangle his simple neighbors in\r\n     arguments sadly vexing to their orthodoxy. On one occasion he\r\n     devoted an hour to prove to BULLARD that there was no\r\n     future after death.\r\n\r\n     '\"Well,\" exclaimed Squire B----, \"you kin talk jest as much as ye\r\n     please. Free speech is permitted; but I don't believe ye. I tell\r\n     you what, MYERS, the soul _is_ immortal; I'll bet five\r\n     dollars on it, and leave it to Deacon PARRISH!\"'\r\n\r\nThis is indeed believing in human power; and yet who would laugh\r\n_through_ his heart at it? For it is this same _belief_ in other men,\r\nmere mortals like ourselves, in hero-worship, which led man through the\r\nstormy ages of old on to the lighter and brighter time, when we see afar\r\nthe promised time when great ideas shall rule instead of great men, and\r\nheroism yield to sincere, unselfish ministry. Great was the final lesson\r\nof Friar BACON'S head--'Time will be.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe failure of the great Southern Confederacy to secure recognition in\r\nEurope will doubtless provoke sad strains from the bards of that\r\nunfortunate 'empire.' Nor less to be pitied are those who have put their\r\ntrust in contracts and become the 'victims of misplaced confidence.' The\r\nfollowing brace of parodies sets forth the sorrows of either side with\r\ntouching pathos.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSAL COTTON GIN.\r\n\r\n  He journeyed all creation through,\r\n    A peddler's wagon, trotting in;\r\n  A haggard man, of sallow hue,\r\n  Upon his nose the goggles blue,\r\n  And in his cart a model U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.\r\n\r\n  His seedy garb was sad to view--\r\n    Hard seemed the strait he'd gotten in;\r\n  He plainly couldn't boast a _sou_,\r\n  And meanly fared on water-gru-\r\n  el, or had swallowed whole a U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.\r\n\r\n  To all he met--Turk, Christian, Jew--\r\n    He meekly said, 'I'm not in tin;\r\n  In fact I'm in a serious stew,\r\n  And therefore offer unto you,\r\n  At half its worth, my model U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.\r\n\r\n  'As sure as four is two and two,\r\n    It rules the world we're plotting in;\r\n  It made and ruined Yankee Doo-\r\n  dle, stuck to him like Cooper's glue,\r\n  And so to you would stick this U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.'\r\n\r\n  Now Johnny Bull the peddler knew,\r\n    And thus replied with not a grin:\r\n  'Hi loves your 'gin' like London brew-\r\n  ed ale, but loathes the hinstitu-\r\n  tion vitch propels your model U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.\r\n\r\n  'Hi knows such coves as you a few,\r\n    And, zur, just now, hi'm not in tin;\r\n  Hi tells you vot, great Yankee Doo-\r\n  dle might hincline to put me through\r\n  Hif hi should buy your model U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.'\r\n\r\n  Then spake smooth Monsieur _Parlez-vous_,\r\n    Whose gilded throne was got in sin,--\r\n  (As was he too, if tales are true):\r\n  'I does not vant your modal U-'\r\n  (He sounds a V for W)\r\n    'niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.\r\n\r\n  A negar in de fence I view--\r\n    Your grand machine he's rotting in;\r\n  I smells him now, he stinketh! _w-h-e-w_--\r\n  _Give me a good tobacco chew_,\r\n  And you may keeps your modal U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.'\r\n\r\n  The peddler then sloped quickly to\r\n    The land he was begotten in;\r\n  With woeful visage, feelings blue,\r\n  He sadly questioned what to do,\r\n  When none would buy his model U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.\r\n\r\n  From out his pocket then he drew\r\n    A rag that _blood_ was clotting in;\r\n  It had a field of heavenly blue,\r\n  Was flecked with stars--the very few\r\n  That glimmered on his model U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.\r\n\r\n  He gazed long on its tarnished hue,\r\n    And mourned the fix he'd gotten in;\r\n  Then filled his eyes with contrite dew,\r\n  As in its folds his nose he blew,\r\n  And thus addressed his model U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin.\r\n\r\n  'Thou crownless king, thy days are few;\r\n    The world thou art forgotten in;\r\n  Ere thou dost die, thy life review,\r\n  Repent thy crimes, thy wrongs undo,\r\n  Give freedom to the dusky crew\r\n  Whose blood now stains the model U-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin-\r\n    niversal nigger-cotton-gin!'\r\n\r\n\r\nA SORROWFUL DIALOGUE.\r\n\r\nFRIEND OF HUMANITY.\r\n\r\n  Needy axe-grinder! whither are you going?\r\n  Sad is your visage, sadder far your raiment,\r\n  Rimless your hat, your coat has got a hole in't,\r\n    So have your trowsers!\r\n\r\n  Seedy axe-grinder! little know the great ones,\r\n  Who buy fat jobs, and steal the public lucre,\r\n  What times befall the poverty-stricken devils\r\n    Who grind their axes!\r\n\r\n  Tell me, axe-grinder, how you came so seedy?\r\n  Did some great man ungratefully entreat you?\r\n  Was it FERNANDO, first king of our Gotham,\r\n    Or the Collector?\r\n\r\n  Or did some evil WEED set you to burning\r\n  The Cataline, and pocket all the plunder;\r\n  Or did the patriot BEN engulf your little\r\n    All in a lottery?\r\n\r\n  Tell me, axe-grinder!

And a poetical correspondent of ours seems\r\ndetermined that few and far between as the old-fashioned spinners are in\r\nthis country, the race shall not entirely disappear without taking a\r\nsong with them, and a quaint, pleasant lesson. Dear reader, to the\r\nCONTINENTAL'S way of thinking, there is something very winning\r\nin the thought of that 'great holiday,' when, free from all task, we\r\nshall play merrily evermore 'out-of-doors,' in eternal light, over\r\ninfinite realms of beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINNING.\r\n\r\n    Dearest mother, let me go;\r\n  I am tired of this spinning, yet the whizzing wheel goes round,\r\n  Till my brain is dull and dizzy with its ceaseless, humming sound.\r\n  I can hear a little blue-bird, chirping sweetly in yon tree;\r\n  And he would not stay there, mother, if he were not calling me.\r\n\r\n    Oh! in pity, let me go:\r\n  I have spun the flaxen thread, until my aching fingers drop;\r\n  And my weary feet will falter, though the whizzing wheel should stop.\r\n  I can see the sunny meadow where the gayest flowers grow;\r\n  And I long to weave a garland;--dearest mother, let me go.\r\n\r\n    Nay, be patient, eager child;\r\n  Summer smiles beyond the door-way, but stern poverty is here;\r\n  We must give her faithful service, if her frown we would not fear.\r\n  Spin on cheerly, little daughter, till your needful task is done,\r\n  Then go forth with bird and blossom, at the setting of the sun.\r\n\r\n    Wait _thou_, also, troubled soul;\r\n  Thou may'st look beyond the river, where the white-robed angels stand;\r\n  Hear the faint, celestial music, wafted from the summer land;\r\n  But thou cans't not leave thy labor;--when thy thread is duly spun,\r\n  Thou shalt flee on flashing pinions, at the setting of the sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe times have been hard, reader, our friend, yet all merriment has not\r\nentirely died out, and there is still the sweet voice of music to be\r\nheard in the land. In New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and many minor\r\ncities, the Benedictine ULLMANN hath been ubiquitously about, operating\r\nmost vigorously, while the philosophic and courteous GOSCHE hath not\r\nbeen far distant. And they heralded HINKLEY, and BORCHARD, and KELLOGG,\r\nand all the other sweet swans of song; they drew after them the gems of\r\nthe opera; there was selling of _Libretti_, (and in Boston,\r\n'los-_an_-gers'); there was the donning of scarlet and blue striped\r\ncloaks, gay _coiffures_ and butterflying fans; there was flirting, and\r\nfun, and gentle gayety in the New York Academy, and with the Boston\r\nAcademies it was not otherwise, only that among the latter the Saxon\r\npredominateth, and the dark-eyed, music-loving children of Israel, who\r\nso abound in most opera audiences, are very rare.\r\n\r\nWhat we intended to do, O reader, was to give the biography of\r\nBENEDICT ULLMANN. Lo! here it cometh:--\r\n\r\n     Vita Sancti Benedicti.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ULLMANN is about three thousand years old.\r\n\r\n     The New York _Herald_ once called him Mephistopheles. He is not\r\n     Mephistopheles, however, but the same thing, which is\r\n     ULLMANN. He is a spirit bearing human form. Don't forget.\r\n\r\n     King SOLOMON sat beneath the golden pavilion one\r\n     afternoon, playing silver melodies on a gold harp. Up went the\r\n     notes--the spirits of the Sephiroth bore them--even up to a\r\n     premium, and the very angels stopped sewing on their white robes to\r\n     hear the ravishing melody.\r\n\r\n     By his side sat the Queen of Sheba, counting out her money.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly, there was a strange vibration, a marvelous tone. The\r\n     queen paused. The king smiled. The angels went on with their\r\n     sewing. (According to Rabbi ABARBANEL, they were knitting.\r\n     This created a schism between the schools of Cracow and Cordova,\r\n     which lasted four centuries.)\r\n\r\n     'Why smilest thou, Oh SOLOMON?'\r\n\r\n     'I smiled, my dear queen, because you and I became, just now,\r\n     unwittingly, the parents of a strange being.'\r\n\r\n     'Why, SOLOMON--how you talk!' exclaimed the Q. of S.\r\n\r\n     'Yea, for the ring of thy gold, oh my Queen, and the last\r\n     chord-tone from my harp mingled in mystical unity and made a sound\r\n     unheard before on earth. And the spirit of that sound, which is of\r\n     money and of music, is the spirit whereof I spoke.'\r\n\r\n     Then the queen marveled greatly at the wisdom of SOLOMON,\r\n     and gave him a shekel. The king rung it on the table and touched\r\n     his harp. Again the strange tone thrilled out loud.\r\n\r\n     'There he goes!' quoth SOLOMON. 'My blessing on him. And\r\n     therefore the sprite is called Blessed to this day, which in Latin\r\n     is _Benedict_.\r\n\r\nThus was ULLMANN born, who was the first who ever sold music;\r\nand, whereas before his time music was only iron or silvern, after he\r\ntook it up it became golden--very fine, and ra-ther ex-pen-sive.\r\nHowbeit, he loved music as well as money, and gave the people their\r\nmoney's worth, and many a jolly opera and fine tenor did he bring out:\r\nyea, had it been possible he would have engaged DON JUAN\r\nTENORIO himself, so that Don Giovanni might have been produced as\r\nperfectly as possible--the Don Giovanity of vanities.\r\n\r\nApropos of music, there is among the novelties of the season a French\r\n'operetta,' entitled '_Les Noces de Jeannette_,' in which a very\r\npeculiar bridegroom distinguishes himself, like Christopher Strap in\r\n'Pleasant Neighbors,' by smashing the furniture. This recalls something\r\nwhich we heard narrated in the opera _foyer_ the other evening.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, in Paris, there was a very good comedian who prided\r\nhimself on being perfectly 'classic.' To be classic in France is to be\r\nelegantly conventional. No actress can be really _kissed_ according to\r\nclassic rules; the lips must be faintly smacked about three feet from\r\nher shoulder. Wills are classically written by a flourish of the pen,\r\nand classical banqueters never pretend to eat.\r\n\r\nNow there was a humorous scene which greatly depended on much breakage\r\nof furniture; and to this scene our actor, in the opinion of the\r\nmanager, did not do justice. Rolling over one tea-cup did _not_,\r\naccording to the latter, constitute a grand smash.\r\n\r\nThe actor became irritated. '_Pa'r'r-bleu!_' he exclaimed, 'you\r\nSHALL have a grand smash then, if you must, and no mistake.'\r\n\r\nThe scene begun. There was a tea-table, and the irate performer gave one\r\nkick, and sent the whole concern crashing into the pit. There was a roar\r\nof applause.\r\n\r\n('Ah! this is something like,' said the manager, rubbing his hands.)\r\n\r\nThe chairs were next attacked and broken into the completest\r\nkindling-wood, as by a madman. The manager began to look grave.\r\n\r\nThere were two tables left, a piano, and a closet. The actor stepped\r\nbehind the scenes and reappeared with an axe. Bang! went the\r\ntimber--crack--splinter--\r\n\r\n'Stop!' roared the manager.\r\n\r\n'Go on!' 'bravo!' 'go on!' roared the audience.\r\n\r\nThe stage was cleared, but the scenery still remained. And into the\r\nscenery went the actor 'like mad.' Planks and canvas came tumbling down;\r\nthe manager called his assistants; the house was delirious with joy. The\r\nmanager rushed on the stage; the actor kicked him over into the\r\norchestra, and seizing the prompter's box, hurled it crashing after.\r\n\r\nWe do not know how matters were arranged, but we believe that the\r\nmanager never tried afterwards to convert a classic actor to the\r\nromantic school.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe shade of Bishop BERKLEY would rejoice, could it read at\r\nthis late date such a tribute to the merit of the once famed tar water,\r\nwhich he invented. But a solemn feeling steals over our heart when we\r\nremember that the hand which penned these lines now lies cold in death,\r\nand that the shades of the idealist and the poet may ere this have\r\njoined in the spirit land.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAR WATER.\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE W.

ÆSOP has dramatized this proverb in a pretty fable.\r\n\r\n  'The people went away; the baboons remained.'\r\n\r\n  'A rose fell to the lot of a monkey.'\r\n\r\nOr, as the Latins said, '_Asinus ad Lyram_'--'A gold ring in a sow's\r\near.'\r\n\r\n     'God bless him who pays visits, and short ones at that.'\r\n\r\n     'The husband of two parrots--a neck between two sticks.'\r\n\r\n     'I asked him about his father. \"My uncle's name is SHAYB,\"\r\n     he replied.'\r\n\r\n     'They wanted a keeper for the pigeon-house, and gave the keys to\r\n     the cat.'\r\n\r\n     'Filth fell upon dirt. \"Welcome! my friend,\" said he.'\r\n\r\n     'Scarcer than fly-brains.'\r\n\r\n     'Gain upon dirt rather than loss upon musk.'\r\n\r\nMusk plays a great part in the East. Even the porters in Cairo bear bags\r\nof it and are scented by it.\r\n\r\n  'When the monkey reigns, dance before him.'\r\n\r\nThis slavish proverb is thoroughly Oriental.\r\n\r\n     'They met a monkey defiling the mosque. \"Dost thou not fear,\" quoth\r\n     they, \"lest God may metamorphose thee?\" \"I should,\" quoth he, \"if I\r\n     thought he would change me into a gazelle.\"'\r\n\r\n     'He fled from the rain and sat down under the water-spout.'\r\n\r\nOr, as we say, out of the frying-pan into the fire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDivers and sundry 'screeds' which we had hoped to lay on this present\r\n'Editor's Table,' are unavoidably postponed until the February number,\r\nwhen they will make their 'positively first and last appearance.' Hoping\r\nthat our own first appearance may not be without your approbation, we\r\nconclude, wishing you, reader, once more--very sincerely--the happiest\r\nof 'happy New Years.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: We honestly believe the true course to pursue with South\r\nCarolina, is to colonize her under the protection of our troops.

Dr. Palmer, of New\r\nOrleans, in which the man of God asserts that slavery is a 'divine\r\ntrust, to be perpetuated and continued.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: NOTE BY THE EDITOR.--The reader will find further\r\nreference to the grave of AARON BURR in an article, in the\r\npresent number of the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, entitled 'The\r\nGraveyard at Princeton.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Apart from philosophical and theological agitation in\r\nAmerica, great additions were made to our general literature by\r\ntranslations from French and German, and their influence upon our\r\nyounger writers is visible at the present day in almost every newspaper\r\narticle. This task of translating and editing was accomplished--for the\r\ntime--on a grand scale and in a scholarly manner. Chief among those who\r\ndevoted themselves to it was George Ripley, who, in his excellent\r\n_Library of Foreign Standard Literature_, gave the public the choicer\r\ngems of French and German philosophy, poetry, or lighter prose. C.S.\r\nHenry, then professor of philosophy in the University of New York,\r\nembraced with zeal the teachings of Cousin, translated his\r\n_Psychology_,--there had been a version of the 'Lectures' published in\r\n1838,--and wrote, for the use of students, a small but comprehensive\r\n_History of Philosophy_, which would have been perfectly 'eclectic' had\r\nit not devoted a somewhat unfair proportion of its pages to eclecticism.\r\nTranslations of minor German lyrics into English, in most instances\r\nsurpassing their rivals of British origin, were made by several young\r\nUnitarian clergymen, among which those by Cranch, Peabody, and Brooks,\r\nwere, we believe, preëminent. The _Dial_, by its criticisms of foreign\r\nliterature and art, guided many to the originals, while the Orthodox\r\nonslaught, in reviews or in lectures, by Murdoch and others, in which\r\nGerman philosophy was carefully traced from Lucifer down to Hegel, gave\r\nto hungry and inquiring neophytes many valuable hints. As, with the\r\nmajority of its friends, 'Transcendentalism' assumed a deeply religious\r\nform, there resulted, of course, a grand revival of pietistic, mystical,\r\nand magical reading. Even the polemics of the early Quakers were\r\nun-dusted, while Swedenborg was soon found to be a rich mine. In due\r\ntime, the works of Jung-Stilling, and other occult seers of the Justinus\r\nKerner school, were translated, and contributed, in common with the then\r\nnew wonders of animal magnetism and clairvoyance, to prepare the public\r\nfor 'spiritualism.' The appearance, in 1841, of a translation of the\r\n_Heinrich von Ofterdingen_ of Novalis, by a student of Cambridge, named\r\nStallknecht, was one of the works of the day which increased the\r\ninterest in foreign literature, and made its study fashionable. This\r\nmystical romance, called by its author the 'Apotheosis of Poetry,' was\r\ndistinguished by a simple pathos, an ultra-refinement of thought, an\r\nalmost womanly delicacy of expression, and a deeply religious sentiment.\r\nSuch works fascinated many who had been proof against the sterner\r\nallurements of the more practical Goethe or the aristocratic Schiller,\r\nand added a new regiment to the army that was assailing with vehemence\r\nthe fortress of German literature.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Cymbeline, Act III., Sc. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\nContinental\r\n\r\nMonthly\r\n\r\n\r\nDevoted to Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY, 1862.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBOSTON:\r\n\r\n  J.R.
