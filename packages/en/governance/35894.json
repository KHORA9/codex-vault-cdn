They were written originally in the form of\r\nletters to a friend, but, though they stand substantially as first\r\nprinted, various alterations have been made consequent upon the\r\nnecessities of a permanent rather than a serial form. The Author does\r\nnot profess to have exhaustively discussed every political question\r\nwhich is of practical importance to-day--for that, within the limits\r\nassigned, would have been impossible; but he has attempted to furnish a\r\nbody of information regarding the principles and aims of present-day\r\nLiberalism, not easily accessible elsewhere, which may be useful to\r\nthose whose ideas upon public affairs are yet unformed, and helpful to\r\nthe political cause he holds dear.\r\n\r\n_May, 1888._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE\r\n      I.

We are governed by majorities, and every vote counts. Even the\r\nheaviest polls are sometimes decided by a majority of a single figure.\r\nIn the history of English elections, many instances could be found\r\nwherein a member was returned by the narrowest majority of all--the\r\nmajority of one; and when a member so elected has been taunted with its\r\nslenderness, he has had a right to reply, as some have replied, in\r\nwell-known words: \"'Tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church\r\ndoor; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve.\" And not only in the\r\nconstituencies, but in Parliament itself, decisions have been arrived at\r\nby a solitary vote. The great principle animating the first Reform Bill\r\nwas thus adopted by the House of Commons; and the measure shortly\r\nafterwards was taken to the country with the advantage thus given it.\r\nAs, therefore, everything of importance in England is decided first in\r\nthe constituencies, and then in Parliament, by single votes, it is\r\nobvious that in each possessor of the franchise is vested a power which,\r\nhowever apparently small when compared with the enormous number of\r\nsimilar possessors elsewhere, may have a direct bearing in turning an\r\nelection, the result of which may affect the fate of some important\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nSo far most will doubtless agree without demur; but, in their\r\nindifference to political questions, may think that it is only those\r\ninterested in them who have any real concern with elections. This is\r\nanother mistake, for political questions are so intimately bound up with\r\nthe comfort, the fortune, and even the fate of every citizen of a free\r\ncountry, that, although he may shut his eyes to them, they press upon\r\nhim at every turn. It would be a very good world if each could do as he\r\nliked and none be the worse; but the world is not so constituted, and it\r\nis politics that lessen the consequent friction. For the whole system of\r\ngovernment is covered by the term; and there is not an hour of the day\r\nin which one is free from the influence of government.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for one to be conscious of this in order to be\r\ncertain that it is so. When he is in perfect health he is not conscious\r\nthat every part of his body is in active exercise, but, if he stumble\r\nover a chair, he is made painfully aware of the possession of shins. And\r\nso with the actions of government. As long as things work smoothly the\r\nmajority of people give them little heed, but, if an additional tax be\r\nlevied, they are immediately interested in politics. And although taxes\r\nare not the least unpleasant evidence that there is such a thing as a\r\ngovernment, it is far from the most unpleasant that could be afforded.\r\nThe issues of peace and war lie in the hands of Parliament, although\r\nnominally resting with the Executive, for Parliament can speedily end a\r\nwar by stopping the supplies; and it is not necessary to show how the\r\nprogress and result of an armed struggle might affect each one of us.\r\nThe State has a right to call upon every citizen for help in time of\r\nneed, and that time of need might come very quickly at the heels of a\r\ndisastrous campaign. It is easy enough in times of peace to imagine that\r\nsuch a call upon every grown man will never be made; but it is a\r\npossible call, and one to be taken into account when the value of a vote\r\nis considered.\r\n\r\nThose who are sent to Parliament have thus the power of embarking in\r\nenterprises which may diminish one's revenue by increased taxation and\r\nimperil his life by enforced service. And in matters of less importance,\r\nbut of considerable effect upon both pocket and comfort, they wield\r\nextensive powers. They can extend or they can lessen our liberties; they\r\ncan interfere largely with our social concerns; their powers are nowhere\r\nstrictly defined, and are so wide as to be almost illimitable. And for\r\nthe manner in which they exercise those powers, each man who possesses a\r\nvote is in his degree responsible.\r\n\r\nThere are persons who affect, from the height of a serene indifference,\r\nto look down upon all political struggles as the mere diversions of a\r\nlower mental order. That kind of being, or any approach to its attitude\r\nof mind, should be avoided by all who wish well to the government of the\r\ncountry. To sit on the fence, and rail at the ploughman, because his\r\nboots are muddy and his hands unwashed, is at once useless and\r\nimpertinent; and to stand outside the political field, and endeavour to\r\nhinder those who are doing their best within, deserves the same\r\nepithets. When it is said that hypocrites, and humbugs, and self-seekers\r\nabound in politics, and that there is no place there for honest men,\r\ndoes not the indictment appear too sweeping? Has not the same argument\r\nbeen used against religion; and is it not one of the poorest in the\r\nwhole armoury of controversy? If there are hypocrites, and humbugs, and\r\nself-seekers in politics--and no candid person would deny it, any more\r\nthan that there are such in religion, in business, in science, and in\r\nart--is it not the more necessary that every honest man should try and\r\nroot them out? If every honest man abstained from politics, with what\r\nright could he complain that all politicians were rogues? But no sober\r\nperson believes that all politicians are rogues, and those superior\r\nbeings who talk as if they are deserve condemnation for doing nothing to\r\npurify the political atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSome who would not go so far as those who are thus condemned, still\r\nlabour under the idea that politics are more or less a game, to the\r\nissue of which they can afford to be indifferent. This, it may be\r\nfeared, is the notion of many, and it is one to be earnestly combatted.\r\nEvery man owes the duty to the State to assist, as far as he can, those\r\nwhom he considers the best and wisest of its would-be governors. There\r\nis nobility in the idea that every elector can do something for the\r\nnational welfare by thoughtfully and straightforwardly exercising the\r\nfranchise, and aiding the cause he deems best. Young men especially\r\nshould entertain this feeling, for youth is the time for burning\r\nthoughts, and it is not until a man is old that he can afford to\r\nsmoulder. The future is in the hands of the young of to-day; and if\r\nthese are indifferent to the great issues of State, and are prepared to\r\nlet things drift, a rude awakening awaits them.\r\n\r\nThe details of political work need not here be entered upon. All that is\r\nnow wanted is to show that that work is of very real importance to every\r\none; and that, unless taken in hand by the honest and capable, it will\r\nfall to the dishonest and incapable for accomplishment. And as the vote\r\nis a right to which every free Englishman is entitled, and a trust each\r\npossessor of which should be called upon to exercise, there ought not to\r\nremain men on the registers who persistently decline to use it. Absentee\r\nlandlords have been the curse of Ireland, and they will have to be got\r\nrid of. Abstentionist voters might, in easily conceivable circumstances,\r\nbe the curse of England, and they would have to be got rid of likewise.\r\n\r\nThe value of a vote may be judged from the fact that it saves the\r\ncountry from a periodical necessity for revolution. Everything in our\r\nConstitution that wants altering can be altered at the ballot-box; and\r\nwhereas the vote-less man has no direct influence upon those affairs of\r\nState which affect him as they affect every other citizen, the possessor\r\nof the franchise can make his power directly felt. We are within sight\r\nof manhood, it may be of adult, suffrage; and if the vote were of no\r\nvalue it would be folly--almost criminal folly--to extend its use. Those\r\nwho deem it folly are of a practically extinct school in English\r\npolitics. For better or worse, the few are now governed by the many,\r\nand the many will never again be governed by the few.\r\n\r\nThose who are of the many may be tempted to urge that that very fact\r\nlessens the worth of the vote in that every elector has the same value\r\nat the polling booth, and that, however intelligent may be the interest\r\nhe takes in politics, his ignorant neighbour's vote counts the same as\r\nhis own. But that is to forget what every one who mixes with his\r\nfellow-men must soon learn--that the intelligent have a weight of\r\nlegitimate influence upon their less-informed fellows which is\r\nexceedingly great. Our vote counts for no more than that of the man who\r\nhas sold his suffrage for beer; but our influence may have brought\r\ntwenty waverers to the poll, while that of our beer-drinking\r\nacquaintance has brought none.\r\n\r\nA cynic has observed that \"politics are a salad, in which office is the\r\noil, opposition the vinegar, and the people the thing to be devoured.\"\r\nBut to approach public affairs from that point, and to judge them solely\r\non that principle, is as reasonable as to use green spectacles and\r\ncomplain of the colour of the sky. Politics should be looked at without\r\nprejudice, but with the recollection that in them are concerned many of\r\nour best and wisest men. If that be done, and the mind kept open for the\r\nreception of facts, there is little doubt of the admission that there is\r\na deep reality in politics, and a reality in which every one is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--IS THERE ANYTHING PRACTICAL IN POLITICS?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll will possibly admit that, in conceivable circumstances, a vote may\r\nbe useful, but many will not be prepared to allow that politics are an\r\nimportant factor in our daily life. War, they would urge, is a remote\r\ncontingency, and a conscription is, of all unlikely things, the most\r\nunlikely; our liberties have been won, and there is no chance of a\r\ndespot sitting on the throne; and, even if taxes are high, what can any\r\none member of Parliament, much less any one elector, do to bring them\r\ndown? From which questions, and from the answers they think must be made\r\nto them, they would draw the conclusion that, whatever might have been\r\nthe case formerly, there is nothing practical in the politics of to-day.\r\n\r\nIt would not be hard to show that a conscription is by no means an\r\nimpossibility; that our liberties demand constant vigilance; and that\r\nindividual effort may greatly affect taxation. But even if the answer\r\ndesired were given to each question, the points raised, except the last,\r\nare admittedly remote from daily life; and, if politics are to be\r\nconsidered practical, they must concern affairs nearer to us. This they\r\ndo; and if they affected only the greater issues of State, they would\r\nnot be practical in the sense they now are. It is the small troubles,\r\nwhether public or private, which worry us most. The dust in one's eye\r\nmay be only a speck, but, measured by misery, it is colossal.\r\n\r\nThe law touches us upon every side, and the law is the outcome of\r\npolitics in having been enacted by Parliament. From the smallest things\r\nto the greatest, the Legislature interferes. A man cannot go into a\r\npublic-house after a certain hour because of one Act of Parliament; he\r\ncannot deal with a bank upon specified days because of another. One Act\r\nof Parliament orders him, if a householder, to clean his pavement;\r\nanother prohibits him from building a house above a given height in\r\nstreets of a certain width. And while the law takes care of one's\r\nneighbour by affixing a well-known penalty to murder, it is so regardful\r\nof oneself that it absolutely prohibits suicide. We are surrounded, in\r\nfact, by a network of regulations provided by Parliament. We are no\r\nsooner born than the law insists upon our being registered; we cannot\r\nmarry without the interference of the same august power; and when we\r\ndie, those who are left behind must comply with the formalities the law\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nIt may be answered that this does not sound like politics; that there is\r\nnothing of Liberal or Tory in all this; but there is. Liberals, for\r\ninstance, have been mainly identified with the demand for the better\r\nregulation of public-houses; it is to the Liberals that we owe a\r\nlong-called-for reform in the burial laws; and it is due to the Liberals\r\nthat a change in the marriage regulations, particularly affecting\r\nNonconformists, is on the eve of being adopted. Social questions are not\r\nnecessarily divorced from party concerns, and the moment Parliament\r\ntouches them they become political. If one looks down a list of the\r\nmeasures presented to the House of Commons he will see that from the\r\npurity of beer to the protection of trade-marks, from the enactment of a\r\nclose-time for hares to the provision of harbours of refuge, from a\r\ndeclaration of the size of saleable crabs to the disestablishment of a\r\nChurch--every subject which concerns a man's external affairs,\r\npolitical, social, or religious, is dealt with by Parliament.\r\n\r\nEven if only those political matters are regarded which have a\r\ndistinctly partisan aspect, there is more that is practical in them than\r\nwould at first be perceived. \"What,\" it may be asked, \"is local option,\r\nor county councils, or 'three acres and a cow' to me? I have no\r\nparticular liking for drink; I have not the least ambition to become a\r\ncombination of guardian and town councillor; and I am in no way\r\ninterested in agricultural concerns. When you require me to take an\r\nactive part in promoting the measures here indicated, how, I want to\r\nknow, am I concerned in any one of them?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer is that any and all of them should concern the questioner a\r\ngreat deal. He imagines he is not directly interested because of the\r\nreasons put forward. Is he certain those reasons cover the whole case?\r\nHe has \"no particular liking for drink,\" and, therefore, would not\r\ntrouble himself to obtain local option. But has he not been a\r\nsufficiently frequent witness of the crime and misery caused by drink to\r\nbe persuaded that it is the duty of every good citizen to do all that in\r\nhim lies to lessen the evil effects? And as such good results have\r\nflowed from the stricter regulation of the sale of intoxicating liquors,\r\nought it not to be his endeavour to place a further power of regulation\r\nin the hands of those most interested--the people themselves?\r\n\r\nEstablishing county councils may not touch the individual citizen so\r\nnearly, though it is in that direction that a solution of the local\r\noption problem is being attempted to be found; and the supposed\r\nquestioner has \"not the least ambition to become a combination of\r\nguardian and town councillor.\" Perhaps not; other people have, and it is\r\na legitimate ambition that does them honour. The work performed by town\r\ncouncillors, and guardians, and members of school boards is excellent\r\nservice, not only to the locality but the State. The freedom which\r\nEngland enjoys to-day is largely owing to the habits of self-government\r\nfostered by local institutions, the origin of which is as old as our\r\ncivilization, and the roots of which have sunk deeply into the soil. And\r\nseeing how our towns have thriven since their government was taken from\r\na privileged few and given to the whole body of their inhabitants, is\r\nthere not fair reason to hope that the county districts will similarly\r\nbe benefitted by institutions equally representative and equally free?\r\nAnd, as the improvement of a part has good effect upon the whole, even\r\nthose who may never have a direct connection with the suggested county\r\ncouncils, will profit by their establishment.\r\n\r\nWith equal certainty it may be asserted that the condition of the\r\nlabourer is of practical importance to every citizen. \"I am in no way\r\ninterested in agricultural concerns,\" it is said; and if by that is\r\nsimply meant that the objector does not work upon a farm, has no direct\r\ndealings with agricultural produce, and no money invested in land, he,\r\nof course, would be right. But even these conditions do not exhaust the\r\npossibilities of connection with agriculture, which is the greatest\r\nsingle commercial interest this country possesses; and, so\r\ninter-dependent are the various interests, if the largest of all is not\r\nin a satisfactory state the others are bound to suffer. It is those\r\nothers in which most of us may be specially concerned, but we are\r\ngenerally concerned in agriculture; and as the latter cannot be at its\r\nbest as long as the labourers are in their present condition, is it not\r\nobvious that all are interested in every honest endeavour to get that\r\ncondition improved? This is not the moment to argue the details of any\r\nplan; but the principle is plain--the condition of the agricultural\r\nlabourer has passed into the region of practical politics.\r\n\r\nThere is a school among us, and perhaps a growing one, which, affecting\r\nto despise such matters as these, wishes to make the State a huge\r\nwage-settling and food-providing machine. If one talks to its members of\r\npublic affairs, they reply that the only practical politics is to give\r\nbread-and-cheese to the working classes. But fact is wanted instead of\r\ntheory, demonstration rather than declamation, and, in place of a\r\nplatitude, a plan. For it is easy to talk of a State, in which there\r\nshall be no misery, no poverty, and no crime; but the practical\r\npolitician will want to know how this is to be secured; and while\r\nwaiting for a plain answer, will decline to be drawn from the questions\r\nof the immediate present.\r\n\r\nNo one need sigh for other political worlds to conquer while even such\r\nproblems as have just been noted ask for settlement; and there are\r\nfurther departments of public affairs which demand attention, and which\r\nare pressing to the front. Most would admit that a vote may be useful\r\nsometimes. I say it is useful always. All would own that the greater\r\nmatters of law and liberty may fairly be called practical politics. I\r\nadd that the lesser matters with which Parliament has to deal, and which\r\naffect us daily, are equally worthy the name. Let one look around and\r\nsay if \"everything is for the best in this best of all possible worlds.\"\r\nIf he cannot, he ought to strive for the reform of that which is not for\r\nthe best. And as long as he has to strive for that reform, so long will\r\nthere be something practical in politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--WHY NOT LET THINGS ALONE?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why can't you let things alone?\" is a question which has often been put\r\nby those who either care little for politics or who wish to stave off\r\nreform. It was the favourite exclamation of a Whig Prime Minister, Lord\r\nMelbourne, and it is still used by many worthy persons as if it were\r\nreally applicable to matters of government. \"Things\"--that is public\r\naffairs--can no more be let alone than one can let himself alone, or his\r\nmachinery alone, or his business alone. The secret of perpetual motion\r\nhas not been discovered in the State any more than in science. If one is\r\na workman and leaves things alone, he will be dismissed; if a tradesman\r\nor manufacturer, he will become bankrupt; if a property-owner, ruin will\r\nequally follow. A man would not leave his face alone because it had been\r\nwashed yesterday; he would not argue that as a face it was a very good\r\nface, and that one thorough cleansing should last it a lifetime. And the\r\nConstitution needs as careful looking after as one's business or his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nA sound Radical of a couple of centuries ago--and though the name\r\nRadical had not then been invented, the man Radical was frequently to\r\nthe fore--put this point in plain words. \"All governments and societies\r\nof men,\" said Andrew Marvell, \"do, in process of time, gather an\r\nirregularity and wear away. And, therefore, the true wisdom of all ages\r\nhath been to review at fit periods those errors, defects, or excesses\r\nthat have crept into the public administration; to brush the dust off\r\nthe wheels and oil them again, or, if it be found necessary, to choose a\r\nset of new ones.\" And if Marvell be objected to as an authority, one can\r\nbe given which should satisfy even the staunchest Conservative. \"There\r\nwas never anything by the wit of man so well devised or so sure\r\nestablished which in the continuance of time hath not been corrupted.\"\r\nThat expression of opinion is not taken from any Whig, Liberal, or\r\nRadical source, but from the preface to the Book of Common Prayer.\r\n\r\nThere is an older authority still, and that is the proverb which says \"A\r\nstitch in time saves nine.\" One can scarcely read a page of English\r\nconstitutional history without seeing the advances made in the comfort,\r\nprosperity, and liberty of the people by timely reform; and no man would\r\nseriously urge our going back to the old standpoints. Yet every reform,\r\nthough we may now all agree that it was for the greatest good of the\r\ngreatest number, was opposed by hosts of people, who talked about \"the\r\nwisdom of our ancestors,\" and asked, \"Why can't you let things alone?\"\r\nIt may be said that the grievances under which men labour to-day are\r\nnothing like as great as those against which our fathers fought.\r\nHappily--and thanks to the enthusiasts of old--that is so; but if they\r\nare grievances, whether small or large, they ought to be removed. There\r\nare some who think that a man with a grievance is a man to be\r\npitied--and put on one side. But, even if those so afflicted are apt to\r\nprove bores, such complaints as are well founded should be attended to.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact beyond question that there is no finality in politics, and,\r\nto take two examples from the present century--the Reform Act of 1832,\r\nwhich was thought by its authors to be a \"final\" measure, and at the Act\r\nof Union with Ireland, which the first Salisbury Administration\r\ndescribed in their Queen's Speech as \"a fundamental law\"--it will be\r\nseen that the dream of finality in each case has been and is being\r\nroughly dispelled. What man has done, man can do--and can undo.\r\n\r\nThe instances mentioned deserve a closer examination, because they so\r\nperfectly show the impossibility of standing still in political affairs.\r\nIf ever there was a measure which statesmen of both parties held to be\r\nfinal, the Reform Act was that one. During the discussions upon it, the\r\nword \"finality\" was more than once used; Sir Robert Peel two years later\r\ndeclared that he considered it \"a final and irrevocable settlement of a\r\ngreat constitutional question;\" and in 1837, as in 1832, its author,\r\nLord John Russell, spoke of it as \"a final measure.\" Final it was in the\r\nsense that England would never go back to the days of borough-mongering,\r\nbut there the finality ended. As early as the year after it passed, a\r\nLiberal member declared in his place in the House that \"he for one had\r\nnever conceded the monstrous principle that any legislative measure was\r\nto be final; still less had he ever conceded the yet more monstrous\r\nprinciple that the members of that House were entitled by any sort of\r\ncompromise to barter away the rights and privileges of the people.\" The\r\nviews thus plainly laid down have been put in practice by men of both\r\nparties; the ten-pound franchise of 1832 gave place in 1867 to household\r\nsuffrage for the boroughs, and this in 1884 was extended to the\r\ncounties. So much for the \"finality\" of the one great Act of this\r\ncentury to which the word has been applied.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"fundamental law\" of the Union with Ireland is threatened\r\nwith alteration and amendment in the same fashion as the \"final\" Reform\r\nAct. Already, by the disestablishment of the Irish Church, a large hole\r\nhas been made in it; and a larger will be made when Home Rule is gained.\r\nThere is in England no law of so \"fundamental\" a nature that it cannot\r\nbe mended or ended just as the people wish. No generation has power to\r\nbind its successors; and if the Parliament of 1800 was able to make the\r\nLegislative Union, the Parliament of to-day is able to unmake it. Upon\r\nthis point--and it affects not only the general question now being\r\nargued, but a particular question yet to be discussed--one of the most\r\ndistinguished \"Liberal Unionists\" may be quoted. Mr. Bright, speaking at\r\nLiverpool in the summer of 1868, observed--\"I have never said that\r\nIrishmen are not at liberty to ask for and, if they could accomplish it,\r\nto obtain the repeal of the Union. I say that we have no right whatever\r\nto insist upon a union between Ireland and Great Britain upon our terms\r\nonly.... I am one of those who admit--as every sensible man must\r\nadmit--that an Act which the Parliament of the United Kingdom has\r\npassed, the Parliament of the United Kingdom can repeal. And further, I\r\nam willing to admit what everybody in England allows with regard to\r\nevery foreign country, that any nation, believing it to be its\r\ninterest, has a right both to ask for and to strive for national\r\nindependence.\" If, then, even a \"fundamental law\" can be got rid of, if\r\noccasion demands and the people wish, what hope can the most lukewarm\r\nhave that things will be let alone?\r\n\r\nPolitics, in fact, may fairly be called a sort of see-saw: we are\r\nconstantly going up and down, and can never be still. As long as a\r\npublic grievance remains unremedied, so long will there be a call for\r\nreform; and one may be sure that, though he may come to a ripe old age,\r\nhe will not live enough years to see every wrong made right. Some may\r\nhide behind the question put and answered eighteen centuries ago; may\r\nask, as was then asked, \"Who is my neighbour?\" and may seek to avoid\r\ndoing as they would be done by. But, as citizens of a free State, they\r\nhave no right to shirk their duty to those around them. No man who looks\r\nat society with open eyes can doubt that much can be done by the\r\nLegislature to better the conditions of daily life. We do wrong if we\r\nallow others to suffer when efforts of ours can remove at least some of\r\ntheir pain.\r\n\r\nTherefore, things cannot be let alone in politics any more than in daily\r\nlife; and even if they could, it would not be right to let them. It does\r\nnot need that one should give all his leisure moments to politics, and\r\nall the energies he can spare from business to public life. But it does\r\nneed that he should pay some heed to that which concerns his fellow-man\r\nand the society in which he lives; and all should be politicians in\r\ntheir degree, not for love of place, or power, or excitement, but\r\nbecause politics really mean much to the happiness and welfare of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--OUGHT ONE TO BE A PARTISAN?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we come from \"first principles\" to the more immediate topics of the\r\nday, party considerations at once enter in; and to the question, \"Ought\r\none to be a partisan?\" I answer \"Certainly.\" On the political barometer\r\na man ought distinctly to indicate the side he takes--not stand in the\r\nmiddle and point to \"change.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal talked of the beauty of non-partisanship, of the\r\nnecessity for looking at public matters in a clear white light, and of\r\nthe exceeding glory of those who put country before party. Such of this\r\nas is not commonplace is cant, and in politics Johnson's advice to\r\n\"clear your mind of cant\" is especially to be taken. When a public man\r\ntalks of putting his country before his party, he surely implies that he\r\nhas been in the habit of putting his party before his country, and that\r\nman's record should be carefully scanned. For it will very often be\r\nfound that those who boast of placing country before party place\r\nthemselves before either.\r\n\r\n\"Party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours\r\nthe national interest upon some particular in which they are all\r\nagreed.\" That is Burke's definition, and it holds good to-day. Superfine\r\nfolk speak as if there were something derogatory in the fact of\r\nbelonging to a party, some lessening of liberty of judgment, some\r\nforfeiting of conscience. That need not be. There must be give-and-take\r\namong members of the same party, just as there must be among those of\r\nthe same household, of the same religious connection, and often of the\r\nsame business concern. The necessity to bear and to forbear is as\r\nobvious in politics as in other matters of daily life, which is only\r\nsaying in a different fashion that in politics, as in everything, a\r\nman's angles have to be rubbed off if he is to work in company with\r\nanybody else. But he gives up a portion of his opinions only to retain\r\nor strengthen those he considers essential. A Churchman is still a\r\nChurchman whether he is labelled High, Low, or Broad; he may believe\r\nwith Canon Knox-Little, with Bishop Ryle, or with Archdeacon Farrar, and\r\ncontinue a member of the Established Church; and it is only when\r\nconscience compels him to differ from them all upon some essential point\r\nof doctrine or practice that he becomes a Protestant Dissenter, a\r\nUnitarian, a Roman Catholic, or, it may be, an Atheist.\r\n\r\nAs with religion, so with politics. A Conservative is still a\r\nConservative, whether he be called a Constitutionalist, a Tory Democrat,\r\na Tory, or, as Mr. William Henry Smith was accustomed to describe\r\nhimself, an Independent-Liberal-Conservative. He may be of the school of\r\nthe late Mr. Newdegate, of Lord Salisbury, or of Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill, and the party bond is elastic enough to embrace him. And when\r\nit is remembered that the name \"Liberal\" covers all sorts and conditions\r\nof friends of progress, from Lord Hartington to Mr. Labouchere, it will\r\nbe seen that a man must be querulous indeed who cannot find rest for the\r\nsole of his foot in one or other of the great parties of the State.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is easy to quote opinions from some eminent persons in\r\ncondemnation of the party system. There is a saying of Dr. Arnold that a\r\nLiberal is \"one who gets up every morning in the full belief that\r\neverything is an open question;\" and with this may be coupled a chance\r\nexpression of Carlyle, that \"an English Whig politician means generally\r\na man of altogether mechanical intellect, looking to Elegance,\r\nExcitement, and a certain refined Utility as the Highest; a man halting\r\nbetween two Opinions, and calling it Tolerance;\" while there may be\r\nadded the quotation, better known than either, \"Conservatism discards\r\nPrescription, shrinks from Principle, disavows Progress; having rejected\r\nall respect for Antiquity, it offers no redress for the Present, and\r\nmakes no preparation for the Future.\" It was the author of these last\r\nwords who uttered also the caustic remark, \"It seems to me a barren\r\nthing, this Conservatism, an unhappy cross-breed; the mule of politics,\r\nthat engenders nothing.\" And that author was Benjamin Disraeli,\r\nafterwards Earl of Beaconsfield.\r\n\r\nOf course, this merely shows that hard things have been and can be said\r\nof all parties, but if they have been as bad as thus represented, is it\r\nnot strange that England has done so well under their rule? It may be\r\nreplied that, whatever has been the case, the fact now is that the old\r\nparties are dead, and the idea may be echoed of those who wish to keep\r\nthe Tories in power, that only \"Unionists\" and \"Separatists\" are left;\r\nbut, setting aside the circumstance that the Liberals emphatically\r\ndisclaim the latter title, the facts are against the original\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\nThe history of our Constitution will show that parties bring the best\r\nmen to the front, groups the worst--the most pushing, pertinacious, and\r\nimpudent of those among them. And when men talk, as some are talking\r\nto-day, of new combinations--combinations of persons rather than of\r\nprinciples--to take the place of the old parties, they should be watched\r\ncarefully to see whether they do not degenerate, as other men in similar\r\ncircumstances have done, into mere hungry scramblers for place.\r\n\r\nMuch of the flabby feeling which pervades some minds in antagonism to\r\npartisanship has been nourished by the cry of \"measures, not men.\" \"To\r\nattack vices in the abstract, without touching persons, may be safe\r\nfighting indeed, but it is fighting with shadows.\" These words of Pope\r\nwere taken by Junius to enforce his opinion that \"'measures and not men'\r\nis the common cant of affected moderation--a base counterfeit language,\r\nfabricated by knaves and made current among fools.\" \"What does it\r\navail,\" he asked, \"to expose the absurd contrivance or pernicious\r\ntendency of measures if the man who advises or executes shall be\r\nsuffered not only to escape with impunity, but even to preserve his\r\npower?\" If this opinion be put aside as being only that of a clever but\r\nvenomous pamphleteer, an equally strong condemnation of the old\r\ncuckoo-cry can be quoted from the greatest philosopher who ever\r\npractically dealt with English politics. \"It is an advantage,\" said\r\nBurke, \"to all narrow wisdom and narrow morals, that their maxims have a\r\nplausible air, and, on a cursory view, appear equal to first principles.\r\nThey are light and portable. They are as current as copper coin, and\r\nabout as valuable. They serve equally the first capacities and the\r\nlowest; and they are at least as useful to the worst men as the best. Of\r\nthis stamp is the cant of 'not men, but measures'; a sort of charm by\r\nwhich many people get loose from every honourable engagement.\" And, if\r\nwe go to the gaiety of Goldsmith from the gravity of Burke, it is\r\nsignificant that the author of \"The Good-Natured Man\" puts in the mouth\r\nof a bragging political liar and cheat the expression, \"Measures, not\r\nmen, have always been my mark.\"\r\n\r\nBut, it is sometimes said, the very fact of not being a partisan argues\r\nfreedom from prejudice. Does it not equally argue freedom from\r\nprinciple? If a man holds a principle strongly, he can hardly avoid\r\nbeing what the unthinking call prejudiced. It is surely better to be\r\nfast anchored to a principle, even at the risk of being called\r\nprejudiced, than to be swayed hither and thither by every passing\r\nbreeze, like the \"independent\" politician--defined by the late Lord\r\nDerby as \"a politician not to be depended upon\"--with the liability of\r\nbeing wrecked by some more than usually stirring gust.\r\n\r\nWe have only to look at the political history of the past half-century\r\nto find that it is the \"prejudiced\" men who have done good work, and the\r\n\"independent\" politicians who have made shipwreck of their public lives.\r\nThe former held their principles firmly; they lost no opportunity of\r\npushing them to the front; and success attended their efforts. As for\r\nthe politicians who were too proud, or too unstable, or too quarrelsome\r\nto work in harness with their fellows, the shores of our public life\r\nhave been strewn with their wrecks. The glorious opportunities for good\r\nthat were missed by Lord Brougham, the wasted career of the once popular\r\nRoebuck are matters of history. And in our own day we can point to Earl\r\nGrey and Mr. Cowen--and the narrow escape from a similar fate of Mr.\r\nGoschen--as striking instances of the fact that no good thing in\r\npolitics can be done by men who cannot or will not join with a great\r\nparty to secure the ends for which they strive. The independent\r\npolitician, in fact, must of necessity appear an incomplete sort of\r\nman--always leading up to something and never getting it; everlastingly\r\nstriking the quarters, but never quite reaching the finished hour.\r\n\r\nIt is not only, however, the crotchety man, or the quarrelsome man, or\r\nthe tactless man, who, because he cannot work with anybody else, poses\r\nas \"independent.\" There are also \"men of no decided character, without\r\njudgment to choose, and without courage to profess any principle\r\nwhatever--such men can serve no cause for this plain reason, they have\r\nno cause at heart.\" Burke here clearly describes a large section of\r\n\"armchair politicians,\" who turn many an election without a distinct\r\nidea of what will be the ultimate result of their action. They are of\r\nthe kind even more forcibly characterized by Dryden a century before--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Damn'd neuters, in their middle way of steering,\r\n     Are neither fish, nor flesh, nor good red herring;\r\n     Nor Whigs, nor Tories they; nor this, nor that;\r\n     Nor birds, nor beasts; but just a kind of bat;\r\n     A twilight animal; true to neither cause,\r\n     With Tory wings, but Whiggish teeth and claws.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrimmers of this type live and flourish to-day as they lived and\r\nflourished in the age of Dryden and of Burke, and the airs they give\r\nthemselves of superiority over the ordinary run of politicians deserve\r\nall the ridicule men of more practical tendencies can pour upon them.\r\nOne would fancy that it must sometimes occur even to them that, as in\r\nwarfare the efforts of two opposing mobs, led by generals who\r\nperpetually differed among themselves, would cause more rapine and\r\nconfusion, and ensure an even less satisfactory result, than those of\r\ntwo armies captained by men accustomed to discipline, and striking blows\r\nonly where blows could be effective; so in the constant movement of\r\npublic affairs a multitude of wrangling counsellors would bring ruin\r\nupon the State, where a struggle between two opposing parties,\r\nrepresenting distinct principles, would clear a path in which it could\r\nsafely tread.\r\n\r\nNo one, therefore, should be frightened out of taking part in politics\r\nby the idea that there is anything wrong in being a partisan. A working\r\nman joins a trade union, in order that by strengthening his fellows he\r\nmay strengthen himself; a religious man becomes a member of a Christian\r\nchurch, so as to assist in spreading the truth he cherishes; and any one\r\nwho dearly holds a political principle ought to attach himself to a\r\nparty, that he may secure for that principle the success which, if it is\r\nworth believing in, is worth striving for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--WHY NOT HAVE A \"NATIONAL\" PARTY?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes asked, even by those who would agree generally that\r\npartisanship is not unworthy, whether all the old distinctions of\r\nLiberal and Conservative, Tory and Radical, are not out of date, and\r\nwhether it is not possible to form a \"National\" party. The idea of such\r\na formation has been \"in the air\" for a long time, and has been put\r\nforward with more frequency since the breach in the Liberal ranks upon\r\nthe Irish question. But although politicians as eminent as Mr.\r\nChamberlain and Lord Randolph Churchill have given countenance to the\r\nidea, it has as yet resulted in nothing of practical value.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain has argued that \"our old party names have lost their\r\nforce and meaning,\" but, even if they had, the suggested appellation\r\nmust be held to be a misnomer. It is a contradiction in terms. If the\r\nwhole nation be agreed upon a certain course, it is not a national\r\n\"party\" which advocates it; if it be not agreed, no section, no\r\nhalf-plus-one, has the right to arrogate to itself the adjective. The\r\nlast time any faction did so was at the general election of 1880, when\r\nthe supporters of Lord Beaconsfield attempted to claim the title even\r\nwhen they were being swept out of their seats wholesale by the flowing\r\ntide of national indignation. All honest politicians work for what they\r\nconsider the benefit of the nation, and no portion of them has a title\r\nto assume that it alone is righteous.\r\n\r\nThe inappropriateness of the name, moreover, is not only general but\r\nparticular. The proposed combination, according to the statesman already\r\nquoted, is to \"exclude only the extreme sections of the party of\r\nreaction on the one hand, and the party of anarchy on the other.\" But\r\nwho is to define how far a reactionary may go without being considered\r\n\"extreme,\" and who in the English Parliament is \"an anarchist\"?\r\n\r\nFurther, a \"national party\" must be presumed to represent the\r\nnation--that is the whole of the United Kingdom. But the projected body,\r\nif it opposed Home Rule, would ignore the wishes of 85 out of the 101\r\npopularly elected representatives of Ireland; 44 out of the 70 popularly\r\nelected representatives of Scotland; and 26 out of the 30 popularly\r\nelected representatives of Wales; as well as the whole body of the\r\nGladstonian Liberals in England. At the last general election, 1,423,765\r\npersons in this kingdom cast their votes on the \"Unionist,\" and\r\n1,341,131 on the Liberal side; and the latter number could scarcely be\r\nignored when a \"national\" party is being formed.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the words of the immortal Mr. Taper--\"A sound\r\nConservative Government, I understand; Tory men and Whig measures\"--the\r\nTories have promised to bring in Liberal Bills; but the process will be\r\nregarded by many with the same feelings as those of Mr. Disraeli when he\r\ncharged Sir Robert Peel with the petty larceny of Whig ideas, as did\r\nLord Cranborne (now Lord Salisbury) when he denounced Mr. Disraeli's\r\npolitical legerdemain in perpetrating a similar offence, and as did\r\nanother prominent politician when he said, \"The consistency of our\r\npublic life, the honour of political controversy, the patriotism of\r\nstatesmen, which should be set above all party considerations--these are\r\nthings which have been profaned, desecrated, and trampled in the mire by\r\nthis crowd of hungry office-seekers who are now doing Radical work in\r\nthe uniform of Tory Ministers.... I will say frankly that I do not like\r\nto win with such instruments as these. A democratic revolution is not to\r\nbe accomplished by aristocratic perverts; and I believe that what the\r\npeople desire will be best carried into effect by those who can do so\r\nconscientiously and honestly, and not by those who yield their assent\r\nfrom purely personal or party motives.\" These words were spoken in 1885;\r\nand the speaker was Mr. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nThe new party to exist must have organization, and as by its very\r\nconstitution all Liberal and Radical associations would have to be\r\nexcluded, the Primrose League alone would be ready to hand. But he who\r\npays the piper calls the tune, and what that tune would be can easily be\r\nguessed. Liberals and Radicals would necessarily be kept out of the\r\ncombination, for men who consider themselves entitled to twenty\r\nshillings in the pound, and who might be content to accept ten as an\r\ninstalment, would not take ten as payment in full of some of their\r\nbills, and a \"first and final dividend\" of nothing on others they hold\r\nof value. And the Radicals and other Gladstonian Liberals being left\r\nout, the remaining party must be overwhelmingly Conservative, and the\r\nfighting opinion of a party is that of its majority.\r\n\r\nIt is thus not an enticing prospect for any thoroughgoing lover of\r\nprogress. What hope is there of a sound reform of the House of Lords\r\nfrom a party closely wedded to the aristocracy? Of disestablishment in\r\nScotland and Wales, to say nothing of England, from a party relying for\r\nmuch of its power upon the clergy? Of a drastic change in the land or\r\nthe game laws from a party propped up by landlords and game preservers?\r\nOf an improved magistracy from a party deriving great influence from the\r\ncountry squires? Of a popular veto upon licensing from a party to which\r\nbelong nine-tenths of the publicans? Of a progressive income tax or the\r\nmore equitable arrangement of the death duties from a party which has\r\nbecome increasingly attractive to the large capitalists? Of, in fact,\r\nany great reform whatsoever from a party which places \"vested interests\"\r\nin the forefront to the frequent exclusion of justice?\r\n\r\nA party formed in the fashion thus projected would be simply a house of\r\ncards, carefully built, as such houses usually are, by those who have\r\nnothing better to do--pretty to look at, but turned over by the first\r\nbreeze. Lobby combinations such as this are hothouse plants; brought\r\ninto the open they die. In Carlyle's \"French Revolution,\" much ridicule\r\nis poured upon the wondrous paper constitutions of the Abbe Sieyes,\r\nwhich somehow would not \"march.\" Within the last few years the Duc de\r\nBroglie was famous throughout Europe for the clockwork arrangements he\r\nmade for France, and the constant failure that awaited them. The\r\n\"national party\" recalls the works of both duke and abbe, and, like\r\nthem, would resemble nothing so much as a flying machine, constructed\r\nupon the most approved principles by really skilled workmen, and\r\nscientifically certain to succeed, but having, when tested, only one\r\ndefect--it will not fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--IS ONE PARTY BETTER THAN THE OTHER?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly natural to be asked, after trying to prove that\r\npartisanship is praiseworthy, and that a \"national\" party is out of the\r\nquestion, whether one party is so much better than the other that it\r\ndeserves strenuous and continued support. For the purposes of the\r\nargument, it is necessary to consider only the two great parties in the\r\nState--the Liberal and the Tory. These represent the main tendencies\r\nwhich actuate mankind in public affairs--the go-ahead and the\r\nstand-still. Differences in the expression of these tendencies there are\r\nbound to be, according as circumstances vary; but, generally speaking,\r\nthe Tory is the party of those who, being satisfied with things as they\r\nare, are content to stand still, while the Liberal is the party of those\r\nwho, thinking there is ample room for improvement, desire to go ahead.\r\n\r\nThe recent history of our country is all in favour of the Liberal\r\ncontention. If two men ride on a horse one must ride behind, and if two\r\nparties take opposite views of the same measure one must be wrong. The\r\nbest testimony to the fact that, as a whole, the Liberal policy pursued\r\nby this country for more than half a century has been right, is,\r\ntherefore, that even when the Tories have been in the majority they have\r\nnot attempted to reverse it. Every great question that has been agitated\r\nfor by the Liberals as a body, except Home Rule, which has yet to be\r\nsettled, has been settled in the way they wished; and has more than once\r\nbeen carried to the last point of success by the Tories themselves. Not\r\neven the staunchest Conservative would urge a return to the system of\r\nrotten boroughs, would repeal the Education Act, re-establish the Irish\r\nChurch, or renew open voting; and the Tories who would re-enact the Corn\r\nLaws continue few.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury has contended that, even if the Liberals have always been\r\nright and the Tories wrong, it should make no difference to the\r\npresent-day voter; and, speaking at Reading in the autumn of 1883, he\r\nasked--\"Would any of you go to an apothecary's shop because the previous\r\ntenant was a very good man at curing rheumatism? You would say, 'It\r\nmatters little to me whether the former tenant was a skilful man or not;\r\nall that concerns me is the skill of the present tenant of the\r\nestablishment.'\" But supposing, to carry on Lord Salisbury's\r\nillustration, this new tenant could say, \"I have in my possession a\r\nrecipe of my predecessor which proved itself an infallible cure for\r\nrheumatism; I prepare it in the same fashion; it will have the same\r\nresult.\" Would one not reply, \"I will rather trust the recipe which has\r\nalways done good, even though in the course of nature it has changed\r\nowners, than put myself in the hands of the opposition chemist, who,\r\nthough exceedingly old and eminently respectable, never effects a cure,\r\nbut whenever he is called in leaves the patient worse than he finds\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\nAnd when Lord Salisbury strove to make his point more clear, he did not\r\nmend matters much. \"It is only the existing party, whether Liberal or\r\nConservative,\" he said, \"that really concerns you; success, wisdom, and\r\njustice do not stick to organizations or buildings--they are the\r\nattributes of men. It is by their present acts and their present\r\nprinciples that the two parties must be judged.\" Even if this be\r\nallowed--and, carried to its logical extent, it would justify every\r\npiece of \"political legerdemain\" (the phrase applied by Lord Salisbury\r\nhimself to Mr. Disraeli's Reform Bill) the Tory party has ever\r\nperpetrated, or may ever attempt--Liberals need not shrink from the\r\ntest. For the Tories, as they have ever done, are now shrinkingly and\r\nfearsomely following in the paths the Liberals years ago laid down, with\r\njust sufficient deviation to prove that the old Adam of reaction is not\r\ndead. Whether it be free trade, or parliamentary reform, or the\r\nclosure, they initiate nothing; but when the Liberals have cleared the\r\nway, they are eager to adopt all that they have previously denounced,\r\nand to claim as their own principles they have throughout professed to\r\nabhor. Seeing that the Liberals borrow nothing from the Tories, while\r\nthe Tories borrow a very great deal from the Liberals, we can judge the\r\ntwo parties, as Lord Salisbury wished, by their present acts and their\r\npresent principles, and show that the Liberal is the more worthy of\r\npopular support.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, not to be wondered at that such a desire to ignore the\r\npast should be expressed by a politician who, from his maiden speech to\r\nhis most recent efforts, has denounced Liberal ideas; who, at various\r\nstages of his parliamentary career, has opposed the spread of popular\r\neducation, the extension of the suffrage, the creation of the ballot,\r\nthe emancipation of the Jews, the extinction of Church rates, the full\r\nadmission of Dissenters to the Universities, the abolition of purchase\r\nin the army, the repeal of the taxes on knowledge, the throwing open of\r\nthe Civil Service to the people, the right of Nonconformists to be\r\nburied in their parish churchyard, the remission of long-standing and\r\nobviously unpayable Irish arrears, and the destruction of the property\r\nqualification for members of Parliament; whose sympathy for his fellows\r\nmay be gathered from his insinuated comparison of the Irish to\r\nHottentots, and his declaration that it is \"just\" that the children of\r\nthose who have contracted marriage with their deceased wife's sister\r\nshould be bastardized; whose taste for diplomacy was shown by his\r\ndirection to a Viceroy to \"create\" a pretext for forcing a quarrel upon\r\nAfghanistan; whose regard for the strictness of truth was displayed in\r\nhis denial of the authenticity of a well-remembered secret memorandum;\r\nwhose love for liberty was evidenced by the lukewarmness with which he\r\nwatched the struggles for freedom in Italy and Bulgaria, and the hearty\r\nand continuous support he gave to the slave-holding faction in America;\r\nand whose affection for the people may be judged from the fact that,\r\nthroughout his political life, his name has never been identified with a\r\nsingle piece of constructive legislation for their welfare. \"By their\r\nfruits shall ye know them\" is applicable to politics, therefore; as\r\nLord Salisbury, by so strenuously endeavouring to ignore the maxim,\r\npractically admits; and at the risk of putting aside the canon of\r\ncriticism adopted by the noble marquis, let me show some of the fruits\r\nof modern Liberal policy.\r\n\r\nI rise in the morning and go to my breakfast; my tea, my coffee, my\r\nsugar, and my ham are all of easy price because of the reductions in\r\nimport duties made by Liberal Governments. I take up my newspaper, and I\r\nhave it so cheaply because Mr. Gladstone, despite the utmost efforts of\r\nthe Conservatives, secured the repeal of the paper duty. I go to\r\nbusiness, and, as I write my letter or my postcard, I cannot but reflect\r\nthat a Liberal Ministry in 1840 allowed me to send the one for a penny,\r\nand a Liberal Ministry in 1870 to send the other for half that sum. I\r\nproceed to dinner, and find that bread, cheese, and much of my dessert\r\nare the more available because of Liberal remissions. And as in the\r\nevening I visit the theatre, the very opera glasses I hold in my hand\r\nare the cheaper because, in one of his Budgets, Mr. Gladstone included\r\nthese among the hundreds of other articles from which he removed a small\r\nbut galling tax.\r\n\r\nThese are some, and only some, of the material benefits resulting from\r\nthe Liberal policy. What of the political, what of the social, what of\r\nthe moral benefits? If I am an Englishman, I am proud of the fact that\r\nno longer is the national flag allowed to float over a slave; if I am a\r\nScotchman, I rejoice that my country has been freed from the\r\nextraordinary system of mis-representation which weighed upon it like a\r\nnightmare before 1832; if I am an Irishman, I am not forced at the point\r\nof the bayonet to pay tithes to an alien Church, to liquidate arrears\r\nfor rack-rents owing from the time of the famine, or to give an\r\nexorbitant rent for the result of my own improvements; if I am a\r\nChurchman, my Church has been strengthened by the repeal of enactments\r\nwhich provoked opposition, while providing no good for the Establishment\r\nthey professed to serve; if I am a Nonconformist, I am no longer liable\r\nto have my goods seized in support of a Church in which I do not\r\nbelieve, I have the right to be married in my own place of worship, and\r\nto be buried by my own minister by the side of my fathers; if I am a\r\nCatholic, I have been liberated from certain restrictions upon my\r\nreligion, which I resented as an insult and a wrong; if I am a Jew, I\r\ncan sit with the peers, in the Commons, or on the judicial bench; if I\r\nbelong to the army, and am an officer, my rise is made easy--if I am a\r\nprivate, my rise is made possible, by the abolition of purchase; if I am\r\neither soldier or sailor, I owe it mainly to Liberal exertions that\r\ndiscipline is no longer maintained by the lash; if I am a merchant\r\nseaman, my life is the better protected because of the efforts of a\r\nLiberal member of Parliament; if I am in the Civil Service, I have the\r\ngreater chance of success because of the destruction of that system of\r\nnomination, which, however advantageous to the aristocracy, was fatal to\r\nmodest merit; if I am a student, I can go to a University with the\r\ncertainty that not now shall I be deprived of the reward of my exertions\r\nbecause my conscience prevents me from subscribing the Thirty-nine\r\nArticles; if I am a tradesman, my goods are freed from many a customs\r\nduty which formerly restricted their sale; if I am a farmer, I can vote\r\nwithout fear of my landlord, my lands have been to some extent saved\r\nfrom the depredations of hares and rabbits, and my tenure has been\r\nrendered more certain than ever before; if I am an artisan, the fruits\r\nof combination have been secured to me, my employer has been made liable\r\nfor accidents arising from either his carelessness or his greed, my vote\r\nhas been obtained, and by the ballot has been protected; if I am the\r\nchild of the poorest, a school has been opened for me where a sound\r\neducation can be procured at a small cost; in fact, in whatever station\r\nI may chance to be placed, I cannot but feel in my every-day life the\r\nbeneficent influences of the policy advocated by leaders of advanced\r\nthought, and adopted by Liberal Ministries during the past fifty years.\r\n\r\nIf, then, I am asked to justify the Liberal party by showing what it has\r\ndone, I answer that, by timely reform, it has saved England from the\r\ncontinental curse of frequent revolution; that, in striving for the\r\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number, it has in especial elevated\r\nand educated the masses, for whom it has provided cheap food for both\r\nbody and mind; and that it has struggled, and in the main successfully\r\nstruggled, to secure civil and religious equality for all. And in the\r\nfuture as in the past, with perfect liberty as its fixed ideal, and with\r\npeace, retrenchment, and reform as the methods by which it wishes that\r\nideal to be obtained, it will press onward and upward, and ever onward\r\nand upward, until England, now regarded as the mother of free nations,\r\nshall be but one of a gigantic brotherhood of freedom, embracing every\r\ncivilized people that may then inhabit the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--WHAT ARE LIBERAL PRINCIPLES?\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this recital of Liberal deeds, it may fairly be asked, \"What are\r\nLiberal principles?\" and these it is not easy to define off-hand. There\r\nare certain general truths which are the commonplaces of both parties,\r\nand no serious attempt has yet been made to lay down a system of\r\nprinciples with which none except Liberals can agree. But there are\r\ndifferences that underlie the action of the two parties which are\r\nunmistakable, and are worth finding out.\r\n\r\nIf one were to ask the first half-dozen Liberals he met for a definition\r\nof their principles, varying and perhaps vague replies would be\r\nreceived. For in politics, as in other matters that combine speculation\r\nwith practical action, it is only the few who speculate, while the many\r\nare content to act. And even most of those who tried to answer would be\r\napt to reply that Liberal principles could be summed up in the old party\r\nwatch-word--\"Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform,\" thus confounding Liberal\r\nprinciples with Liberal aims.\r\n\r\nThat these aims are well worth striving for has long been an accepted\r\ndoctrine of the party; but, in trying to gain them, we have to adapt\r\nthem to circumstances, and are not called upon in every single emergency\r\nto push them to their logical extent. Logic, after all, is only a pair\r\nof spectacles, not eyesight itself; and attempts to arrange human\r\naffairs upon too precise a basis frequently end, as France so often has\r\nshown, in failure. We long for peace, but not for peace at any price; we\r\nask for retrenchment, but not an indiscriminate paring down of\r\nexpenditure for the sake of showing a saving; and we struggle for\r\nreform, but not to cut all the branches off the trees on the chance of\r\nimproving their appearance.\r\n\r\nBefore, in fact, we have been able to struggle at all for these or any\r\nother points in politics, certain principles have had to be acted upon\r\nby generations of progressive thinkers, which have developed and\r\nstrengthened our liberties. It is, perhaps, presumptuous to attempt to\r\nlay down in a few words a basis of Liberal principle, but I would submit\r\nthat that basis may be found in the contention that\r\n\r\n_All men should be equal before the law_;\r\n\r\nthat, as a consequence,\r\n\r\n_All should have freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and freedom of\r\naction_;\r\n\r\nand that, in order to secure and retain these liberties,\r\n\r\n_The people should govern themselves_.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first point, I do not contend that all men are, or\r\never can be, equal. Differences of mental and physical strength, of\r\nenergy and temperament, and of will to work, there must always be; and\r\nin the struggle for existence, which is likely to grow even keener as\r\nthe world becomes more filled, the fittest must continue to come to the\r\ntop, as they have done and deserve to do. A law-made equality would not\r\nlast a week, but much law-made inequality has lasted for centuries, and\r\nit is against this that Liberals as Liberals must protest. We object to\r\nall law-made privilege, and we ask that men gifted with equal capacities\r\nshall have equal chances. We do not claim any new privilege for the\r\npoor, but we demand the abolition of the old privileges, express and\r\nun-express, of the rich. Something was done in the latter direction when\r\nthe system of nomination in most departments of the civil service and\r\nthat of purchase in the army were got rid of. But as long as in the\r\nhigher departments of public affairs a man has a place in the\r\nlegislature merely because he is the son of his father; as long as in\r\nthe humbler branches no one unpossessed of a property qualification can\r\nsit on certain local boards; and as long as in daily life the facilities\r\nfor frequent appeal, devised by lawyers within the House for the benefit\r\nof lawyers without, provide a power for wealth that is often used to\r\ndefeat the ends of justice, so long, to take these alone out of many\r\ninstances, shall we lack that equality of opportunity which we demand\r\nnot as a favour but a right.\r\n\r\nBut if every man is to be equal before the law, he must have the right\r\nto think as his reason directs; to discuss as freely as he thinks; and\r\nto act as he pleases, so long as his neighbour is not injured in the\r\nhonest discharge of his duties, or the common weal put in jeopardy.\r\n\"Give me,\" said Milton, \"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue\r\naccording to conscience, above all liberties\"--for it is certain that\r\nwith freedom of thought and discussion all other liberties will follow.\r\nJohn Mill carried this principle to the fullest extent when he argued\r\nthat \"if all mankind, minus one, were of one opinion, and only one\r\nperson were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified\r\nin silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be\r\njustified in silencing mankind.\" To all such sweeping generalizations\r\nthere are, however, possible exceptions. No man would be much inclined\r\nto blame Cromwell for suppressing the pamphlet \"Killing no Murder,\"\r\nwhich directly advocated his own assassination; even the strongest lover\r\nof free discussion would not be prepared to allow the systematic\r\ncirculation of exhortations to blow up our public buildings, and\r\ndirections as to the best way of doing it; and instances may conceivably\r\narise--and an invasion one of them--where absolute freedom of\r\npublication and debate would form a national danger. Our liberties,\r\ntherefore, would be sufficiently protected if we recognized the right of\r\nevery man to speak and to act as he pleases, \"so long as his neighbour\r\nis not injured in the honest discharge of his duties, or the common weal\r\nput in jeopardy.\"\r\n\r\nIn order, however, that men may be able to think, speak, and do as they\r\ndeem right, it is necessary that the people shall rule, and that the\r\nmajority, when it has made up its mind, shall have the power to carry\r\nout its decree. Even the Tories of these days will not dispute this\r\nprinciple, and, therefore, Liberals cannot claim it as at this moment\r\ntheir own; and yet, broadly speaking, the root idea of the Tory party is\r\nthe aristocratic theory that the few ought to govern the many, while\r\nthat of the Liberal party is the democratic, that the many ought to\r\ngovern the few.\r\n\r\nIn the days before the mass of the people were a real power in the\r\naffairs of the State, this difference was very clearly marked, for the\r\nTories then were under no necessity to conceal their belief that the\r\n\"common herd\" were not to be trusted in political concerns. And it is\r\nuseful, as showing what the high Tory doctrine on this point really was,\r\nto recall the fact that a judge on the bench, less than a century ago,\r\nin summing up at a political trial, laid it down as a doctrine not to be\r\nquestioned that \"a government in every country should be just like a\r\ncorporation; and in this country it is made up of the landed interest,\r\nwhich alone has a right to be represented. As for rabble, who have\r\nnothing but personal property, what hold has the nation of them? What\r\nsecurity for the payment of their taxes? They may pack up all their\r\nproperty on their backs, and leave the country in the twinkle of an eye;\r\nbut landed property cannot be removed.\" And another judge at a political\r\ntrial within the present century went even further in denying to the\r\npeople not merely the right of interference with public affairs, but\r\neven of comment upon them. \"It is said,\" he observed, \"that we have a\r\nright to discuss the acts of our legislature. This would be a large\r\npermission indeed. Is there to be a power in the people to counteract\r\nthe acts of the Parliament; and is the libeller to come and make the\r\npeople dissatisfied with the Government under which he lives? This is\r\nnot to be permitted to any man,--it is unconstitutional and seditious.\"\r\nWe have outgrown such doctrines as these; and, thanks to the efforts of\r\ngenerations of Liberals who have passed to their rest, the right of the\r\n\"rabble who have nothing but personal property\"--or, for the matter of\r\nthat, no property at all--to take part in settling the affairs of the\r\nState, whether by criticism or active interference, is solidly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that as the Tories of to-day have accepted democracy,\r\nthe Liberals have no right to claim the principles here laid down as if\r\nthey were without exception their own. But this Tory acceptance of\r\ndemocratic ideas is only partial, and a party which mainly depends upon\r\nthe aristocracy for support can never adopt them with consistency and\r\nenthusiasm. The very existence of an hereditary legislature violates the\r\nprinciple that all men should be equal before the law; the theory upon\r\nwhich a State-established Church rests is equally a violation of the\r\nright of every one to think, speak, and act as he chooses; and the\r\ncontinuous efforts of the Tories to limit the franchise, and to erect\r\nbarriers against the majority having their will, are utterly opposed to\r\nthe view that the people should govern, and harmonize with the old idea\r\nthat the people should be governed.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that these differences between the parties mean\r\nnothing, or that we are beyond all danger of losing the advance we have\r\nmade. The ease with which we might slip back into despotism is shown by\r\nthe manner in which the Tories resort to coercion--or, as they prefer to\r\nterm it, \"exceptional legislation\"--when a majority of the Irish people\r\nhas to be cowed. The suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, the abolition\r\nof trial by jury, the extinction of liberty of the press, and the denial\r\nof the right of public meeting have been frequently enacted against the\r\nmajority of the people of Ireland, because their views on the political\r\nsituation have not accorded with those of the majority of the people of\r\nEngland. And though they have all failed, and repeatedly failed, a\r\nvariation of the same old plan is put in operation to-day as if it were\r\na newly-discovered and infallible remedy for every popular ill.\r\n\r\nEasy-going folk are apt to reply that, as these things concern only\r\nIreland, it is of no special moment to ourselves, and that England is\r\nsafe from any revival of a despotic system. Even if this were true it\r\nwould be false morality, and false morality makes bad politics. But it\r\nis not true. Despotism is a disease which spreads, and any development\r\nof it applied to one part of the body politic might, in conceivable\r\ncircumstances, be used as a precedent to apply it to the whole. And if\r\nit be said that in these happy days the men of England have the\r\nundisputed right to think as they like and talk as they will, it can be\r\nanswered that not one of the shackles upon freedom of thought and\r\nfreedom of action has been voluntarily struck off by the Tories, and\r\nthat it is only lately that they prevented a member of Parliament for\r\nyears from taking the seat to which he had been four times elected,\r\nbecause he avowed what he believed upon theological questions.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two parties, even in the present general\r\nacceptance of a democratic system, may be put in words once used by Mr.\r\nChamberlain--\"It is the essential condition, the cardinal principle of\r\nLiberalism, that we should recognize rights, and not merely confer\r\nfavours.\" With us, the suffrage is the right of every free citizen; with\r\nthe Tories, it is a favour conferred upon the working by the moneyed\r\nclasses. We demand religious equality; the Tories are willing to give\r\ntoleration. But favours we do not ask, and toleration we will not have.\r\n\r\nLiberals, in fact, are prepared substantially to subscribe to the\r\nprinciples laid down more than a century since in the American\r\nDeclaration of Independence--a document which sounded the knell of\r\ndespotism on its own side of the Atlantic, and awoke echoes which shook\r\ndown another despotism on ours. \"We hold,\" said that document, \"these\r\ntruths to be self-evident--that all men are created equal; that they are\r\nendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among\r\nthese are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure\r\nthese rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just\r\npowers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of\r\ngovernment becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the\r\npeople to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government,\r\nlaying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in\r\nsuch form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\nThese, broadly speaking, are Liberal principles; and when one has\r\nabsorbed them thoroughly, there comes to him that Liberal sentiment,\r\nthat enthusiasm for his fellows, which feels a blow struck at any man's\r\nfreedom, in any part of the whole world, as keenly as if it were struck\r\nat his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--ARE LIBERALS AND RADICALS AGREED?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that by dealing only with \"the fundamental principles\r\nof the Liberal party,\" the Radicals were put aside as if they had no\r\nseparate existence; and to a large extent this is true, for Radicals are\r\nsimply advanced Liberals. The principles just asserted are common to all\r\nmembers of the progressive party. There are differences as to the time\r\nat which certain measures directly flowing from them shall become a\r\nportion of the party's platform; and that is all.\r\n\r\nA great deal of the prejudice which used to exist against those called\r\n\"Radicals\" has died away, but traces of it linger still; and it will be\r\nwell to see what Radicalism, as a phase of Liberalism, really is. It may\r\nsound strange to be told that the Whigs were the Radicals of an earlier\r\nday, and that they sometimes carried their Radicalism to the point of\r\nrevolution. In these times it is becoming increasingly doubtful whether\r\nthose who call themselves by what was once the honourable title of\r\n\"Whig\" have any claim to be considered members of the Liberal party; and\r\nthere are many who consider that they are now more truly conservative\r\nthan the Conservatives themselves. The Whigs tell us that they are only\r\nacting as the drag on the wheel; but this implies that we are always\r\ngoing down hill. That we do not believe. We hold that we are\r\nprogressing; and a drag which would act upon the coach as it climbs the\r\nhill is a product neither of prudence nor common sense.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the party of progress in these days may be said to combine\r\nLiberal traditions with Radical instincts. The two can mingle with the\r\nutmost ease, and, though they may run side by side for some time before\r\nthey join, the steady stream of the one and the rapid rush of the other\r\nalways unite at last in one broad river of liberalizing sentiment, which\r\nfertilizes as it flows.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when Bolingbroke wrote of some measure that \"such a remedy\r\nmight have wrought a _radical cure_ of the evil that threatens our\r\nconstitution\" to the date, a century later, when those who wished to\r\nintroduce a \"radical reform\" into our representative system were called\r\nby the name, there were many Whigs who talked Radicalism without being\r\naware of it; but when the title had been given to a section of the\r\nLiberal party, it became for a long period a term of reproach. Mr.\r\nGladstone, once speaking at Birmingham, quoted a definition of the early\r\nRadicals which described them as men \"whose temper had been soured\r\nagainst the laws and institutions of their country;\" and he admitted\r\nthat there was much justification for their having been so. But one can\r\nquite understand that men of a soured temper were not likely to be\r\npopular with the placid politician who stayed at home, or the\r\nplace-hunter who went to the House of Commons; and the bad meaning, once\r\nattached to the name, remained affixed to it for a very long time.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, in the speech referred to, was the first great English\r\nstatesman to try and remove the reproach; and this he did by defining a\r\nRadical as \"a man who is in earnest.\" This was flattering, but as a\r\ndefinition lacked precision, for Tories are often in desperate earnest.\r\nMany Radicals would assert that the very name--coming, as it of course\r\ndoes, from the Latin word for \"root\"--tells everything; that it\r\nsignifies that they go to the root of all matters with which they deal,\r\nand that, where reform is needed, it is a root and branch reform they\r\nadvocate.\r\n\r\nTo this it may be replied that to go to the root of everything is not\r\nalways practicable and is not necessarily judicious. If a tree be\r\nthoroughly rotten, if it be liable to be shaken to the ground by the\r\nfirst blast, and thereby to injure all its surroundings, it should\r\ncertainly be cut down, and as soon as it conveniently can be. But if the\r\ntree has only two or three rotten branches, there is no necessity to go\r\nto its root. If one does, it will very probably kill a good tree which,\r\nwith only the decayed portions removed, might bear valuable fruit. As\r\nwith trees, so with institutions; and what seems to be forgotten by many\r\nwho call themselves Radical is that, in a highly-complex civilization\r\nsuch as ours, we have to bear with some things that are far from ideal,\r\nsimply because of that force of do-nothingness which, powerful in\r\nmechanics, is as great in political life.\r\n\r\nA friend who has long worked in the Liberal cause once observed: \"The\r\nmisfortune is that it is difficult to tell what a man's ideas of public\r\npolicy are from the mere fact of his calling himself a Radical. If by\r\nRadical is meant Advanced Liberal--a Liberal determined to push forward\r\nwith all practicable speed, a Liberal who is in earnest--then I can\r\nunderstand it, and I will readily take the name. But if by Radical is\r\nmeant a somewhat hysterical creature, who is ready to fight for every\r\nfad that tickles his fancy, as he seems to be in some cases, or a\r\ncantankerous being whose crotchets compel him to sever himself from all\r\nother workers, as he is in others; if he is of the extreme Spencerian\r\nschool, and demurs to most legislation on the ground that it is\r\nover-legislation, or of the extreme Socialist school, and demands that\r\nGovernment shall do everything, and individual effort be practically\r\nstrangled by force of law, I am not a Radical, and hope never to be\r\ncalled one.\"\r\n\r\nBut the practical Radicalism which is one of the greatest factors in\r\nLiberal policy at the present day, is far removed from the schools just\r\ndepicted. The reasonable Radical is not a believer in any of the\r\nschemes--as old as the hills and yet unblushingly preached\r\nto-day--which, by some legislative hocus-pocus, some supreme stroke of\r\nstatecraft, will \"put a pot on every fire and a fowl in every pot;\" will\r\nendow each widow and give a portion to all unmarried girls; will feed\r\nthe poor without burdening the community; and will make all the crooked\r\npaths straight without undue trouble to ourselves. He holds that\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Diseases desperate grown\r\n     By desperate remedies are removed,\r\n     Or not at all;\r\n\r\n\r\nbut he does not consider all diseases to be of the character described;\r\nhe does not refuse the half-loaf because for the moment the whole one is\r\nimpossible of attainment; and he does not repudiate other honest workers\r\nin the cause of progress because their pace is not quite so swift, and\r\ntheir point of view somewhat different.\r\n\r\nIn the constant striving after a high ideal, there is in the Radical's\r\nheart a resolute desire to emerge from any rut into which politics may\r\nhave degenerated. For the very reason of his existence is that, if there\r\nbe an abuse in Church or State which agitation and argument can remove,\r\nall honest endeavours must be made to remove it. He cannot forget that\r\nmany abuses have been got rid of by these means, and he profits by the\r\nlesson to attack those which remain. It is their extinction at which he\r\naims. Earnestness, enthusiasm, and devotion to principle are his\r\nweapons, and these he will not waste in fruitless longings after a\r\nperfect State, but will use them to make the State we possess as perfect\r\nas is possible. In all things he will aim at the practical; he will\r\nremember that compromise is not necessarily cowardly, and that it is\r\npossible for those who disagree with him to be as honest in their views\r\nand as pure in their aims as himself. And in striving for the greatest\r\nhappiness of the greatest number, he will never forget that the greatest\r\nnumber is all.\r\n\r\nThe answer may be made that this is an ideal Radical, and that the real\r\narticle is very different. So many have been taught to think, but they\r\nare wrong. There are some rough diamonds in the Radical party, it is\r\ntrue; but, so long as they be diamonds, we can afford to wait a little\r\nfor the polish. They are bigoted it may be said, and bigotry is hateful.\r\nBut bigots are just as useful to a reform as backwoodsmen to a new\r\ncommunity; they clear away obstacles from which gentler men would\r\nshrink; rough and occasionally awkward to deal with, they make the\r\npathways along which others can move.\r\n\r\nBut, it is sometimes asked, where are the old philosophical\r\nRadicals--men of the stamp of Bentham, and Grote, and James Mill? Dead,\r\nall of them, having done their life's work faithfully and well; and\r\ntheir successors have to look at politics from the standpoint of\r\nto-day, and not of half a century ago. And when the Tories say that\r\nthese were especially admirable men, it must not be forgotten that their\r\nideas were as strongly opposed and their persons as bitterly assailed by\r\nthe Tories of their own day as are the ideas and the persons of the\r\nunphilosophical Radicals--if they are to be called so--of this present\r\nyear of grace.\r\n\r\nThe Radicals of to-day have their faults, and there shall be no attempt\r\nto conceal them. Many who call themselves by the name discredit it by\r\nimpatience of opposition, readiness to attribute interested motives to\r\nthose differing from them, and intolerance towards those who exercise in\r\nanother direction what they emphatically claim for themselves--absolute\r\nfreedom of thought, speech, and action. Some among them also are prone\r\nto be led aside by a catching phrase, without troubling to ask what it\r\nreally means; and, in order to strengthen their forces, allow themselves\r\nto be connected with any movement that may for the moment be popular.\r\nAnd even more, but these of a much higher stamp, are carried away by the\r\ndangerous delusion that in any political system can be found perfect\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nNo honest Radical will deny the existence of these faults or be offended\r\nthat they should be pointed out. But the essential purity of aim and\r\ndepth of honest fervour possessed by the Radicals of this country\r\ndeserves all recognition. At heavy sacrifice to themselves they have led\r\nthe van in every great political movement, and their instinct has been\r\nproved to be right. They have held aloft the lamp of liberty in times of\r\ndepression when Liberals of feebler soul would have hidden it beneath a\r\nbushel in the hope of brighter days. And, even were their failings more\r\nfar-reaching than any that can be urged against them, their services as\r\npioneers of freedom would entitle them to the heartiest thanks of all\r\nwho have entered into their heritage because of the efforts the Radicals\r\nhave made.\r\n\r\nRadicals and Liberals, then, are agreed as to principle though they\r\ndiffer in methods, for the Liberal is a very good lantern, but a lantern\r\nwhich requires lighting; and it is the Radical who strikes the match.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--WHAT ARE THE LIBERALS DOING?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has now been told a great deal about the principles which the\r\nLiberals entertain, and a list has been given of the many glorious\r\nthings the Liberals have done; but the question of greatest immediate\r\ninterest is what the Liberals are doing, for we cannot live upon the\r\nexploits of the past, but upon the performances of the present and the\r\npromises of the future.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Liberals at this moment are concentrating their main\r\nattention upon the question of self-government for Ireland, there are\r\nother important matters affecting the remainder of the United Kingdom\r\nwhich occupy a place in their thoughts, and which will form their future\r\nparty \"cry.\"\r\n\r\nIt has, of course, often been remarked that men when in Opposition call\r\nout for a great deal which they fail to accomplish when in office; but\r\ndiscredit does not of necessity ensue. It certainly shows that in\r\ncertain instances men do not come up to their ideal, but does that prove\r\nthe ideal to be wrong? Does it not rather prove that those who adopted\r\nit, like mortal men everywhere and in all ages, were fallible? Despite\r\nevery drawback and every backsliding--and such drawbacks and\r\nbackslidings are admittedly many--it is better to have a high ideal and\r\nfail frequently to attain it, than to have no definiteness of purpose\r\nand take the chance of blundering into the right.\r\n\r\nNone should think lightly of the power of a popular cry. It was with the\r\nshout of the leading tenet of their new creed that the Arabs fought\r\ntheir way from Mecca to Madrid; it was with the exclamation \"Jerusalem\r\nis lost!\" that the Crusaders marched across Europe to battle with the\r\nSaracen; it was with the device \"For God and the Protestant Religion\"\r\nthat William of Orange swept the Stuarts out of Britain; and it was with\r\nthe burning words of the \"Marseillaise\" that the raw levies of France\r\ndefied and defeated the trained armies of Europe. For the popular cry\r\nvoices the popular emotion, and when the popular emotion is at its\r\nheight its force is irresistible.\r\n\r\nTo touch the heart of the people must, therefore, be one aim of any\r\ndemocratic party; and that is why the politician who makes no allowance\r\nfor human passion, prejudice, or prepossession is a mere dreamer, who\r\ndeserves and is bound to fail. The fashion of the German philosopher\r\nwho, on being asked to describe a camel, evolved the animal from his\r\ninner consciousness, is that in which some of our political guides\r\ncreate their ideas of the world around them. They sit in the same\r\narmchair as of old, and do not perceive how the conditions have changed.\r\nThey continue to imagine that the clique of some club-house controls\r\npublic events, and that the whisper of the party whip is all-powerful\r\nwith the constituencies. They do not recognize that voters are not now\r\nan appanage of the Reform or the Carlton, because the groove they have\r\nhollowed out for themselves is too deep to allow them to look over the\r\nedge. But in nothing more than in politics is it true that the proper\r\nstudy of mankind is man.\r\n\r\nAnd, if one moves among the masses of his fellows, he will find a\r\ngrowing desire to put to practical use the tools the State has given\r\nthem. Household suffrage and the ballot were not an end but a means, and\r\nthe question which politicians should ask themselves in this day of\r\ncomparative quiet is to what end these means shall be put. Those who\r\ntalk with working men know that there is a vague discontent with things\r\nas they are, which, if not directed into proper channels, may become\r\ndangerous, for in many quarters the old ignorant impatience of taxation\r\nis giving place to an ignorant impatience of the rich. No good will come\r\nof shutting our eyes to the existence of this feeling; the question is\r\nhow in the fairest and fittest manner it can be eradicated.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the working classes have only recently\r\nobtained direct political power, and that there is still much\r\nuncertainty among them as to the best uses to which it can be put. There\r\nwould be nothing immoral in their using that power to better their own\r\ninterests. Men, after all, are but mortal; and, just as the upper\r\nclasses before 1832 used the power of Parliament to further their own\r\nends, and just as later the middle classes, when they were uppermost,\r\nattended carefully to themselves, so the working classes will do when\r\nthey recognize their strength. And this is only saying that men being as\r\nthey are, \"Number One\" will be the most prominent figure in their\r\npolitical calculations, whether that number represents a peer of the\r\nrealm or a labourer on the roads.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to enter into the question of how far the State\r\nought to interfere with social problems. The fact to be emphasized is\r\nthat there is an increasing body of opinion, especially among the\r\nworking classes, that certain social problems will have to be attended\r\nto. Any politician who attempts to forecast the future--more especially\r\nany Liberal who wishes to draw up a party programme--must recognize\r\nthis, and act according to his convictions after fully considering it.\r\n\r\nThe politics of the future will, therefore, have a distinctly social\r\ntinge, but they must include also many questions which are regarded\r\nto-day, and will continue to be regarded, as of a partisan character. It\r\nis requisite, then, to the right understanding of Liberal policy that a\r\nbroad view should be taken of the matters which are likely within no\r\ndistant date to become planks of the party platform. Calm discussion now\r\nmay save misapprehension then, and if we can see exactly whither we are\r\ngoing, we shall be able with the more certainty to pursue our journey.\r\nAnd if, in the course of the discussion, what at the first blush appears\r\nan extreme view is taken, remember always the old truth that half a loaf\r\nis better than no bread--that is, if the half-loaf be good bread and\r\nhonestly earned, and not to be accepted as an equivalent for the whole,\r\nif that be wished for and attainable.\r\n\r\nSubject to this condition, the Liberal party can do no better than\r\nconsider what is likely to come within the scope of its future\r\nexertions; and although it is right to take up one thing at a time in\r\norder that that one thing may be done well, good will be effected by at\r\nonce endeavouring to answer the main questions now before us. Upon the\r\nspirit in which these are discussed, and the manner in which they are\r\nreplied to, much of the future of popular government in England will\r\ndepend. The scientific naturalist of to-day tells us that it is an idle\r\nfable which states that the ostrich hides its head in the sand with the\r\nidea of escaping observation; but really so many of our leading\r\npoliticians execute a variation of this manoeuvre in regard to the\r\nquestions of the future, that the ostrich need not be ashamed to be\r\nstupid in such eminent company.\r\n\r\nA preliminary to the discussion in detail of questions which go to the\r\nroot of many of the most important matters in politics is a resolution\r\nnot to be led aside from any course one may think right by the fear of\r\nbeing called hard names, or by the use of certain venerable but\r\nweather-worn phrases. It is so easy to endeavour to damage political\r\nopponents by applying to them such names as Separatists or Socialists,\r\nAtheists or Revolutionaries, that one cannot wonder that the practice is\r\nfrequently adopted by the Tory party. But hard words break no bones, and\r\nthe politician who is frightened by a nickname may be a very estimable\r\nperson, but he is no good in a fight.\r\n\r\nSimilarly we can afford to despise certain of the phrases which with\r\nsome politicians do duty for argument. No one should be turned back from\r\ndoing what he thought to be right in the circumstances of to-day by\r\nbeing reminded of that mysterious entity \"the wisdom of our ancestors.\"\r\nWhat sane man would conduct a shop as it was conducted 500 years since?\r\nAnd where would science be if we still swore by the skill of the\r\nalchemists? Accumulated experience in the varied transactions of life is\r\nheld to improve man's judgment and capacity; why should it not be\r\nsimilarly held to improve the judgment and capacity of States? Let any\r\none who sighs after the wisdom of our ancestors apply in imagination the\r\npolitical maxims in vogue even a hundred years ago to the affairs of\r\nthis present, and then let him say honestly whether he would wish by\r\nthem to be governed.\r\n\r\nAnother fine-crusted example of a worn-out phrase is that in praise of\r\n\"the good old times.\" We are invited to believe that in some unnamed\r\nage, England was better and brighter, and her people happier and richer,\r\nthan to-day, and mainly because rulers were obeyed in all things and no\r\nquestions asked. But particulars are lacking; and these sketches of the\r\nglories of \"the good old times\" are like nothing so much as Chinese\r\npictures, displaying an abundance of colour but no perspective, an\r\namazing imagination but an absence of exact likeness to anything ever\r\nseen by mortal man.\r\n\r\n\"Dangerous innovations\" also is a phrase at which no one should be\r\nalarmed. No great good has ever been accomplished without many excellent\r\npersons considering it a \"dangerous innovation.\" The Scribes and the\r\nPharisees, and, after them, the Roman Empire, denounced and persecuted\r\nthe Christian religion upon this ground; the most powerful Church in\r\nChristendom, with similar belief and similar lack of success, used every\r\nengine at its command to suppress the Reformation. As in religious so in\r\npolitical affairs. King John would doubtless have described Magna Charta\r\nin just such terms; the partisans of Charles the First certainly held\r\nthat opinion concerning the demand of Parliament to control the Church,\r\nthe army, and the monarchy itself; the opponents of every measure of\r\nreform--political, social, or religious--have used the phrase. From the\r\ngreatest to the smallest reform it has been the same. In the early years\r\nof this century a Parochial Schools Bill, because it did not give all\r\npower to the clergy, was opposed by the then Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nwith the words, \"Their lordships' prudence would, and must, guard\r\nagainst innovations that might shake the foundations of religion.\" When,\r\nin later times, gas was introduced, the aristocratic dwellers in western\r\nLondon protested with equal force against such an innovation as the new\r\nilluminant; and Lord Beaconsfield, in the opening chapters of the last\r\nof his novels, sketched with ironic pen the attempts of high-born ladies\r\nto prevent the spread of light. Thus, in things sublime and in things\r\nridiculous, the cry of \"dangerous innovation\" has been raised until it\r\nhas been rendered contemptible.\r\n\r\nEqually futile is the fear that the Liberals are about to propose \"the\r\nimpossible.\" There is nothing in politics to which that word can be\r\napplied, as even the most cursory study of our history will show. When\r\nmen say that certain measures can \"never\" be carried, they are more\r\nlikely to be wrong than right. In 1687 it would have been deemed\r\nimpossible to place the Crown upon a strictly parliamentary basis; in\r\n1689 this was accomplished. In 1830 the most sanguine reformer scarcely\r\ndared hope that borough-mongering would in his lifetime be destroyed,\r\nand the first popularly elected Parliament was chosen in 1832. In 1865,\r\nnone could have dreamed that household suffrage in the boroughs was\r\nnear; in 1867 it was adopted by a Tory Government. In 1867 he would have\r\nbeen a hardy prophet who would have foretold the speedy downfall of the\r\nIrish Episcopal Establishment; and the Act of Disestablishment was\r\nplaced upon the statute book in 1869. Such instances should of a surety\r\nteach men to be modest in their forecasts of what is possible in\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nIn, therefore, pursuing our search into the why and the wherefore of the\r\npolitics of the future, we must put aside phrases and come to facts. The\r\nphrases will die, but the facts will remain; and the more closely we\r\ngrasp these latter the more certain will those Liberal principles which\r\nhave done so much for the past, do even more for the future.\r\n\r\nAnd, when we come to the facts, we must not forget that a political\r\nquestion is not necessarily unpractical because it cannot be immediately\r\ndealt with; for good is accomplished by the calm discussion of points\r\nwhich are bound some time to be raised, and which, if undebated now, may\r\nbe settled in a gust of popular passion. As Mr. John Morley has well\r\nobserved--\"The fact that leading statesmen are of necessity so absorbed\r\nin the tasks of the hour furnishes all the better reason why as many\r\nother people as possible should busy themselves in helping to prepare\r\nopinion for the practical application of unfamiliar but weighty and\r\npromising suggestions, by constant and ready discussion of them upon\r\ntheir merits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--SHOULD HOME RULE BE GRANTED TO IRELAND?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of Irish self-government is for the present the greatest\r\nthat concerns the Liberal party, and in current politics, as Mr.\r\nGladstone has truly and tersely put it, Ireland blocks the way. This, of\r\ncourse, is not so simply because Mr. Gladstone said it, and even less is\r\nit so because he wished it. The question stands in the path of all other\r\ngreat measures of legislative reform, for the sufficient reason that, at\r\nthe first opportunity after the franchise was enjoyed by every\r\nhouseholder, Ireland declared emphatically, and by a majority\r\nunparalleled in modern political history, in favour of freedom to manage\r\nher own domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious that, when all the popularly-elected members for\r\nthree out of four provinces into which one of the countries which form\r\nthis kingdom is divided, pronounce against the existing system of\r\ngovernment, and when a majority of those for the other province side\r\nwith them, that that system cannot continue to exist with the good will\r\nof those whom it most intimately affects, and can only be maintained by\r\nforce. Such as have followed Mr. Gladstone in this matter do not believe\r\nin the maintenance of a government against the constitutionally declared\r\nwill of the governed, and are agreed that the Irish demand for the\r\nmanagement of purely domestic affairs ought to be granted on the grounds\r\nof justice, expediency, and sound Liberal principles.\r\n\r\nThey hold that to grant the demand would be just, because under the\r\npresent system the vast majority of Irishmen have no practical control\r\nover those by whom they are governed; that it would be expedient,\r\nbecause the kingdom is weakened by the continual disaffection of one of\r\nits component parts; and that it would accord with sound Liberal\r\nprinciples, in that the overwhelming majority of the Irish electorate\r\nhave asked for Home Rule through the constitutional medium of the\r\nballot-box.\r\n\r\n\"The liberty of a people,\" says Cowley, \"consists in being governed by\r\nlaws which they have made themselves, under whatever form it be of\r\ngovernment.\" This definition, which applies strictly to England, applies\r\nnot at all to Ireland. The English system of government has broken down\r\nthere so completely that all parties profess to be agreed that something\r\nmust be devised in its place. Liberals have always held that a people or\r\na class knows better what is good for it than any other people or any\r\nother class, however enlightened or well-meaning. That has been one of\r\nthe main reasons for giving the suffrage to the poor, the ignorant, and\r\nthe helpless, because the experience of ages has taught that the rich,\r\nthe educated, and the powerful, while well able to take care of\r\nthemselves, are either too careless or have too little knowledge to take\r\nthe same care of others. And as with the suffrage, so with\r\nself-government. Any extension must be granted upon broad principles:\r\nsmall concessions grudgingly given are always accepted without\r\ngratitude, and used to extort greater.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" it may be said, \"I am willing to give Ireland a large measure of\r\nself-government, but I won't yield to agitators.\" This is one of the\r\noldest of all replies to demands for reform. How could anything be\r\ngained in politics without agitation? The Tories swear they will yield\r\nnothing until agitation has ceased; and if it ceases, if only for a\r\nmoment, they declare it is evident there is no popular wish for reform.\r\n\"Proceed, my lords,\" said Lord Mansfield, when the American colonies\r\nrevolted--\"proceed, my lords, with spirit and firmness; and when you\r\nshall have established your authority, it will then be time to show\r\nlenity.\" And their lordships proceeded; but the \"time to show lenity\"\r\nnever came, for it was such counsels which lost the American colonies to\r\nthe British Crown.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" it will be added, \"this is not an ordinary agitation; it is a\r\nrevolutionary one.\" In some of its phases that is true, and it is all\r\nthe more reason why its cause should be closely examined. It is the\r\nEnglish themselves who have taught the Irish that ordinary\r\nconstitutional agitation gains them nothing. If it had not been for the\r\norganization of the Volunteers, Grattan's Parliament of 1782 would never\r\nhave been granted; the Duke of Wellington in 1829 admitted that he\r\nyielded Catholic Emancipation to the threat of civil war; it needed the\r\nterrible crimes of the early \"thirties\" to arouse England to the\r\nnecessity for abolishing an iniquitous system of levying tithe; the\r\nFenian outbreaks, the attack on a prison van at Manchester, and the\r\nblowing up of a gaol in London, opened the eyes of the English to the\r\nneed for disestablishing the Irish Church and clipping the claws of the\r\nIrish landlords; the fearful winter of 1880 led to the granting of still\r\nfurther protection to the tenants; and to the \"plan of campaign\" of the\r\nwinter of 1886 was it owing that a Tory Government felt compelled to\r\nstill further encroach upon the property and privileges of the landlords\r\nof Ireland. As long as Ireland has held to constitutional agitation--as\r\nwitness that for Catholic Emancipation from 1801 to 1825, and that for\r\ntenant right from 1850 to 1868--so long has England refused to grant a\r\nsingle just demand; and this is exactly what the Tories are doing now.\r\nIs it any wonder that Irish agitation should have become revolutionary\r\nwhen that is the only kind we have rewarded? In the relations between\r\nthe governing classes and popular movements there has all through been\r\nthis difference--in England, revolution has been staved off by reform;\r\nin Ireland, reform has been staved off till there was revolution.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" it may be continued, \"it is not so much that the agitation is\r\nrevolutionary as that it is criminal which makes me object.\" But a\r\nmovement ought not to be called criminal because of the excesses of a\r\nfew of its extreme partisans. No great popular agitation has ever been\r\nfree from lewd fellows of the baser sort, who have given occasion to the\r\nenemy to blaspheme. But did English Liberals hesitate to support Mazzini\r\nbecause he was accused of favouring assassination; to sympathize with\r\nthe French Republicans because Orsini prepared bombs for the destruction\r\nof Napoleon III.; or to-day to wish well to those Russians who conspire\r\nfor liberty because the wilder spirits among them have assassinated one\r\nCzar and attempted to assassinate another? In our own history, are the\r\nCovenanters to be condemned because some of them murdered Archbishop\r\nSharpe; the early Radicals because Thistlewood and his fellows plotted\r\nto kill King and Cabinet; the Reformers of 1831 because of the Bristol\r\nriots and the destruction of Nottingham Castle; or those of 1866 because\r\nthe Hyde Park railings were thrown down? When it is remembered that even\r\nsuch a man as Peel could, in the midst of a heated controversy, accuse\r\nsuch another as Cobden of conniving at assassination, we should be\r\ncareful how we accept the testimony of any partisan concerning the\r\ncriminality of an agitation to which he is opposed.\r\n\r\nThese objections touch, after all, only the fringe of the matter, and\r\nanother which is frequently urged--that the Irish agitation is a\r\n\"foreign conspiracy\" because it receives aid from the United\r\nStates--does not go much closer to the root. But this, like the others,\r\nmay be disposed of by English examples. Did not Englishmen aid, both by\r\nmen and money, in liberating Greece and uniting Italy? Did they not help\r\nby subscriptions the insurrections in Hungary and Poland, and, when the\r\nformer failed, did not many of them take the refugees into their homes?\r\nDid they not even raise a fund to assist the slave-holding States when\r\nin rebellion? And in all these cases, except in a remote degree the\r\nlast, they had no tie in blood, but only one in sympathy, with those\r\nconcerned. That the Nationalist movement has been largely aided from the\r\nUnited States is undoubted; but that aid has mainly come from those of\r\nIrish birth or parentage who have been driven across the Atlantic to\r\nseek a home. And when it is said that, because of this help, a\r\nself-governed Ireland would rely upon the United States to the detriment\r\nof England, may we not ask why it is that Italy does not rely upon\r\nFrance, though it was France that struck the first effective blow for\r\nItalian unity; or Bulgaria upon Russia, though without the\r\nblood-sacrifice of Russia that principality would never have occupied a\r\nplace on the European map? However much it may be to be regretted,\r\ngratitude does not play any large part in international affairs.\r\n\r\nWhen the more serious objections to the granting Home Rule are urged\r\nthey are no more difficult to meet. \"Ireland is not a nation,\" it is\r\nsaid; \"its people are of different races.\" The argument has been used\r\nbefore by the Tories, and the value of it may be judged by an example.\r\nThe late Lord Derby, as leader of the Tory party, addressed the House of\r\nLords in 1860 in savage denunciation of the efforts then being made to\r\nsecure the unity of Italy; and to the contention that all the\r\ninhabitants of that peninsula were Italians, he answered, in the words\r\nof _Macbeth_ to his hired murderers,\r\n\r\n\r\n       Aye, in the catalogue ye go for men;\r\n     As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\r\n     Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are cleped\r\n     All by the name of dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd those who remember the unbridgeable differences which then appeared\r\nto exist between the Sardinian and the Sicilian, the Florentine and the\r\nNeapolitan, the dweller in Venice and the resident in Rome, will know\r\nthat the perfect unity between them which now makes Italy one of the\r\nGreat Powers would have been considered as unlikely as any between a\r\nBelfast man and an inhabitant of Cork to-day.\r\n\r\n\"The Irish are not fit for self-government,\" is the next contention. If\r\nthis be so, the shame is ours in not having given them the opportunity\r\nfor being trained. We did not refuse to liberate the slaves until they\r\nwere proved to be fit for freedom; we did not decline to give the\r\nlabourers the suffrage until they were proved to be capable of rightly\r\nusing it; for we knew in each case that no such proof could be afforded\r\nuntil the opportunity was offered. No proof that the Irish are not able\r\nto manage a Parliament is given by the corruption of the\r\nsemi-independent body which they enjoyed from 1782 to 1799; for that\r\nconsisted entirely of Protestants, mainly chosen by a band of\r\nborough-mongers, whom Pitt had to buy out at a high price. The same\r\nthing exactly was said by the Tories--sneers about the pigs and all--of\r\nthe Bulgarians in 1876; and they have had good reason since to change\r\ntheir minds. What reason is there to believe that the Irish would be\r\nless able to manage their own affairs than the people of Bulgaria?\r\n\r\n\"But they are naturally lawless.\" Where is the proof? It is true that in\r\ncertain mountainous districts of Kerry and Clare there have been\r\noutbursts of moonlighting, but these have been as nothing compared with\r\nthe prevalence of brigandage in Greece before the Greeks were allowed to\r\nrule themselves, or in Italy before the Italians founded their united\r\nkingdom. Where there is little popular respect for the law, there\r\nlawlessness flourishes; where the people make their own laws, there\r\nlawlessness is put down with a strong hand.\r\n\r\n\"If they had the power they would persecute the Protestants.\" This is a\r\nprophecy, and a prophet has the advantage of being able to soar above\r\nproofs. But the fact that every prominent defender of national rights in\r\nIreland for the last century and a half, except O'Connell, from Dean\r\nSwift down to Mr. Parnell, has been a Protestant, should count for\r\nsomething. The fact that Protestants have again and again been returned\r\nto the Corporations of the most Catholic cities should count for much.\r\nAnd the fact that, when for years not a single one of the 450 English\r\nmembers was a Roman Catholic, several of the 103 Irish members, even\r\nfrom the most Catholic districts, were Protestants, should count for\r\nmore. Such religious persecution as exists in Ireland is certainly more\r\nat Belfast than at Cork.\r\n\r\n\"Giving them a Parliament would break up the empire.\" Why should the\r\nempire be broken up because there was extended to Ireland the principle\r\nwe have granted to Australia and Canada, New Zealand and the Cape? How\r\nis it that the German Empire continues united, though the Reichstag, its\r\nImperial Parliament, is one body, and the Prussian Parliament, the Saxon\r\nParliament, the Wuertemberg Parliament, and the Bavarian Parliament are\r\nquite others? Is there no union between Austria and Hungary, or between\r\nSweden and Norway, though each has its Parliament, and are the United\r\nStates disintegrated because every one of the States has its own Senate\r\nand House of Representatives? If one were asked to name two of the\r\nstrongest nations outside our own, Germany and the United States would\r\nbe the reply; and in each there is a system of Home Rule for the\r\nseparate portions.\r\n\r\n\"But did not the United States crush the Confederates when secession\r\nwas demanded?\" Of course they did; the United States fought against the\r\nSouth separating from the North, as we should against Ireland separating\r\nfrom England. But every State which joined the Confederacy possessed as\r\nample a measure of Home Rule as the Liberals now propose for Ireland;\r\nand, to the lasting honour of the Northern States, that measure was\r\nrestored soon after the war. Home Rule the South had, and has still;\r\nseparation the South asked for, and did not receive.\r\n\r\n\"The Irish are ungrateful people; whatever you give them they ask for\r\nmore.\" Would it not be well to first ask what the Irish have had to be\r\ngrateful for? Granting that we yielded Catholic Emancipation, reformed\r\nthe tithe system, disestablished the Church, and legalized tenant right;\r\nwhy, after all these things, should we expect gratitude? The old phrase\r\nthat \"gratitude is a lively sense of favours to come\" may be unduly\r\ncynical; but is it not absurd to ask that recompense for the doing of\r\nacts of simple justice? Former generations of Englishmen deprived the\r\nIrish of their rights. To what thanks are later generations entitled for\r\nsimply restoring to the Irish the rights of which they had been robbed?\r\n\"Be just and fear not,\" was said of ancient time: \"Be just and expect\r\nnot gratitude,\" should be added to-day. And when it is stated that \"the\r\nIrish ought to accept what we choose to give them,\" it must be replied\r\nthat this is the purely despotic argument which has already done England\r\nsufficient injury by losing her the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is only in this, the briefest, fashion that an answer has been\r\nsketched to the various arguments and assumptions against Home Rule. In\r\ndetermining to grant it, the Liberals are acting strictly according to\r\ntheir old policy of favouring struggling nationalities. The support\r\ngiven by Burke to the cause of America; by Fox to Ireland; by Canning\r\n(in this, as in some other matters, truly Liberal) to Greece; by\r\nPalmerston to Italy; and by Mr. Gladstone to Bulgaria, indicates with\r\nsufficient clearness the traditional Liberal position. For a century we\r\nhave been telling the whole world the advantages of autonomy; are we\r\nnow to decline to adopt, in similar circumstances, the remedy for\r\ndiscontent we have all along preached to, and sometimes forced upon,\r\nothers?\r\n\r\nThe Liberals say with Landor, \"Let us try rather to remove the evils of\r\nIreland than to persuade those who undergo them that there are none.\"\r\nThey are utterly opposed to the idea that it is right to give a people\r\nfree representation and then deliberately to ignore all that that\r\nrepresentation asks. They are, it is true, in a minority at this moment,\r\nbut they do not forget that all great causes have three stages--first to\r\nbe laughed at, next to be looked at, and last to be loved. Home Rule has\r\ncertainly reached the second stage; it will soon reach the third. The\r\nLiberals have been beaten before, but they have always won in the end.\r\nAnd it is well to be beaten sometimes. If life were all sunshine we\r\nshould find it oppressive; an occasional cloud serves to temper the\r\nheat. To the Liberals, as to nature itself, a misty morning is often the\r\nprelude to the brightest day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE LORDS?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the other questions which the Liberals will have to\r\nconsider, it will be well to take them in what may be called their\r\nconstitutional order, and a beginning, therefore, may be made with the\r\nreform of the House of Lords. The theory upon which that House is upheld\r\nis that it is an assembly of our most notable men, called to rule either\r\nby descent from the great ones of the past, or by the proved capacity of\r\nthemselves in the present, who discuss every question laid before them\r\nwith impartiality, and who act as a check upon the hasty and\r\nill-considered legislation of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nSo much for the theory: what of the fact? Those peers who are not\r\ncreations of to-day mainly spring either from Pitt's plutocrats or from\r\nthose who have been granted their patents because of having lavishly\r\nspent their money in electoral support of some party; those who can\r\nclaim their peerage by direct descent from the great ones of the past\r\ncan be numbered by tens, while the whole body is numbered by hundreds;\r\nand just as a sprinkling of successful lawyers, soldiers, and brewers\r\nadds nothing to its historical character, it in no sense brings the\r\npeerage into clear and close contact with the people. As to the\r\nimpartiality displayed by the House of Lords, it is notorious that in\r\nthese days it is little other than an appanage of the Carlton Club, and\r\nthat, whatever the Tory whips desire it to do, it accomplishes without\r\ndemur. And its power as a check upon hasty and ill-considered\r\nlegislation may be judged from the fact that it never dares reject a\r\nmeasure which public opinion strongly demands and upon which the Commons\r\ninsist.\r\n\r\nWhen the history of the House of Lords is studied, it will be found\r\nthat during the past century it has initiated no great measure for the\r\npublic good, and a hundred times has wantonly mutilated or impotently\r\nopposed the reforms the people asked. The mischief it has done touches\r\nevery department of public life. Whether it was to throw out a bill\r\nabolishing the penalty of death for stealing in a shop to the value of\r\nfive shillings, on the ground stated by one of the bishops in the\r\nmajority that it was \"too speculative to be safe;\" to again and again\r\nvote down every proposal to relieve Roman Catholics and Jews from civil\r\ndisabilities; to pander to the will of George IV. in the prolonged\r\npersecution of his wife; or to defeat measures calculated to place the\r\nelectoral power in the hands of the people--the House of Lords has\r\nalways been one of the main forces in the army of darkness and\r\noppression. Remember that every one of the reforms the Liberals have\r\nsecured within the last 50 years has been distasteful to the House of\r\nLords, and calculate the worth or wisdom of that institution.\r\n\r\nIt does not add to the estimation of either the worth or the wisdom that\r\nthe Lords have ultimately accepted what they have bitterly opposed, for\r\nif they have consistently been a stumbling-block in the path of every\r\nreform which the people now cherish their tardy repentance is of little\r\navail as long as they pursue the same obstructive course. And it is not\r\nmerely measures which they throw out, but measures which they mutilate,\r\nthat render them a power for harm. For the Lords are like rabbits; it is\r\nnot so much what they swallow as what they spoil which makes them so\r\ndestructive.\r\n\r\nThose who defend the institution as it exists should, therefore, be\r\ncalled upon to point to some one definite case in recent history in\r\nwhich it can be said, \"Here has the House of Lords done good.\" Mere talk\r\nabout the admirable administrators and the dexterous debaters it\r\ncontains is no argument; for if the legislative functions of the peers\r\nwere abolished to-morrow, those among them who were worthy a seat in the\r\nHouse of Commons would have no difficulty in securing it. What Liberals\r\nobject to is the being subjected to the caprices, the passions, and the\r\nprejudices of some five hundred men, the majority of whom are not\r\nmerely unskilled in legislative faculty and unqualified in\r\nadministrative experience, but are drawn from a single class out of\r\ntouch and sympathy with the mass of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is not the least of the evils of the present system that the\r\nattendance at the sittings of the Lords is of so perfunctory a nature.\r\nEven during the discussion of important measures not more than sixty or\r\nseventy peers, out of over five hundred, are commonly present, while ten\r\nor twelve is not an unusual number to deal with Bills. As Erskine May\r\nhas pointed out, \"Three peers may wield all the authority of the House.\r\nNay, even less than that number are competent to pass or reject a law,\r\nif their unanimity should avert a division, on notice of their imperfect\r\nconstitution.\" And he furnishes an instance where an Irish Land Bill,\r\n\"which had occupied weeks of discussion in the Commons, was nearly lost\r\nby a disagreement between the two Houses, the numbers, on a division,\r\nbeing seven and six.\"\r\n\r\nAdding to their number does not improve the average attendance, and yet\r\nthe pace at which that number is growing is a scandal. In 1885, the\r\nfirst time since 1832, the total membership of the House of Commons was\r\nenlarged, not without trepidation and despite the fact that every member\r\nwould be directly responsible to a constituency. The increase was only\r\ntwelve, and a Premier often creates within a year as many legislators on\r\nhis own account, who, with their successors, are responsible to no one\r\nfor their public conduct. Is it not an absurdity to speak of ourselves\r\nas freely governed and ruled only by our own consent when a Prime\r\nMinister can make as many legislators as he chooses, and there be none\r\nto gainsay him?\r\n\r\nIf it were only that under the present system the drunken and the\r\ndissolute, the blackleg and the debauchee are allowed to sit in the\r\nLords and make laws for us and our children, we should have a right to\r\ndemand that the institution should be \"mended or ended.\" The former\r\nprocess has now distinctly been adopted as a plank in the Liberal\r\nplatform, and the question of reform can, therefore, no longer be put on\r\none side.\r\n\r\nThere are many Radicals who say that as the House of Lords, if it agrees\r\nwith the Commons, is useless, and if it disagrees is dangerous, its\r\nabolition as a legislative body should at once be made a plank in the\r\nparty programme. They argue further, that to reform will be to\r\nstrengthen it, and that, by the reasoning just given, this is\r\nundesirable. But the main point is to secure the best legislative\r\nmachine we can, and there is much to be said for the improvement of the\r\nHouse of Lords into a Senate which shall be in fact what the present\r\ninstitution is in theory--a body of sage statesmen, experienced in\r\naffairs, and elected for a specified term, so as to be directly amenable\r\nto the people, and not removed from obedience to public opinion.\r\n\r\nAs a first step to any reform, the creation of hereditary peerages,\r\nconferring a power to legislate, ought to be stopped. \"The tenth\r\ntransmitter of a foolish face\" ought no longer to be able to transmit\r\nwith the foolishness a power over the lives and liberties of his\r\nfellow-men. If there is any one who continues honestly to believe that\r\nbecause a man has secured a peerage by his brains (and the proportion of\r\ncreations upon that ground is exceeding small) his successors are likely\r\nto prove good legislators, he would do well to procure a list of those\r\npeers who are descended from \"law lords;\" and he would find that while\r\nnot one of them is distinguished for great political or administrative\r\nskill, there are various notorious instances, which will occur to every\r\nreader of the daily newspaper, of those distinguished for exactly the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\nOne minor reform in the constitution of the House of Lords ought to be\r\npressed at once, and that is the removal of the bishops from their\r\npresent place within it. Not only has no one section of religious\r\npersons the right to a State-created ascendency over others, but all\r\nparties are agreed in the most practical form that bishops as bishops\r\nhave no inherent right to legislative power. In 1847, when the bishopric\r\nof Manchester was created, it was provided that the junior member of the\r\nepiscopal bench for the time being should not have a seat in the Lords,\r\nand thirty years later, when the Government of Lord Beaconsfield made\r\nfurther new bishoprics, it similarly did not venture to add to the\r\nnumber of spiritual peers; there are consequently always four or five\r\nwaiting outside the gilded chamber until the death of their seniors\r\nshall let them in.\r\n\r\nWhat Liberals, therefore, demand is that the House of Lords shall be\r\nthoroughly reformed. The bishops must be excluded, no more hereditary\r\nlegislators created, and a system devised by which the House shall\r\nbecome a Senate so chosen as to be directly responsible to the people,\r\nwhose interests it is assumed to serve. A sprinkling of life peers would\r\naggravate instead of lessen the difficulty. An hereditary legislator\r\nmay, for the sake of his successors, be careful not too grievously to\r\noffend the people; an elected legislator, for his own sake, will be the\r\nsame; but a legislator who was neither one nor the other would have no\r\nsuch check, and all experience has shown that corporations elected for\r\nlife become cliquish or even corrupt, for want of the frequent and\r\nwholesome breeze of public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--IS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS PERFECT?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a time, and that not far distant, when the question \"Is the\r\nHouse of Commons perfect?\" would have been considered by many\r\nwell-intentioned and easy-going persons to be impertinent, even if not\r\nactually irreverent. But we live in days when every institution has to\r\nsubmit to the test of free discussion, and its usefulness and efficiency\r\nhave to be proved, if it is to retain its place in the political system.\r\nAnd as there can be little doubt that, for many reasons, a feeling has\r\nbeen widely growing within the past few years that the House of Commons\r\nis neither as useful nor as efficient as it ought to be, the popular\r\nreverence for that great assembly has somewhat diminished; and it\r\nbehoves all who wish to preserve parliamentary government in its fullest\r\nand freest form to examine the causes of apparent decay and to suggest\r\nmethods of amelioration.\r\n\r\nThe preservation intact of the powers and privileges of the House of\r\nCommons must be the desire of every lover of freedom; but the conduct of\r\nits business must be brought into harmony with modern methods, and the\r\nmechanical side of the assembly made as perfect as possible. Not from me\r\nwill fall one word derogatory to the venerable \"mother of free\r\nparliaments.\" The House of Commons has done too much for England, its\r\nexample has done too much for liberty the wide world through, to allow\r\nany but the ribald and the unthinking to speak lightly of its history or\r\nscornfully of its achievements. For the People's Chamber is not merely\r\nthe most powerful portion of the High Court of Parliament; it is not\r\nalone the central force of the British Constitution, to which kings and\r\nnobles have had, and may again have, to bow; it is the directly elected\r\nbody before whose gaze every wrong can be displayed, and to whose power\r\neven the humblest can look for redress. It deals forth justice to the\r\nmyriad millions of India as to a solitary injured Englishman; it is a\r\nsounding board which echoes the claims of a single peasant or an entire\r\npeople; and it practically commands the issues of peace and war,\r\ninvolving the fate of thousands, and of life and death, involving that\r\nof only one. No policy is vast beyond its conception, no person\r\ninsignificant beyond its sight. It is a mighty engine of freedom,\r\nresponsive to the heart-throbs and aspirations of a whole people, which\r\nhas baffled tyrants, liberated slaves, and raised England to that\r\nposition among the nations which our children and our children's\r\nchildren should be proud to maintain.\r\n\r\nSuch is the assembly which needs reform. Often enough and with much\r\nsuccess has there been raised a cry for \"parliamentary reform,\" but this\r\nhas meant an amendment of the method of electing members, not of the\r\nmanner of conducting business; and it is this latter which now is\r\nurgently required. The stately ship which has sailed the ocean of public\r\naffairs for six centuries has naturally attracted weeds and barnacles\r\nwhich cling to its hull and retard its progress. These must be swept\r\naway if the vessel is to pursue a safe and speedy course; and as little\r\nirreverence is involved in the process as in cleaning and repairing the\r\nold _Victory_ herself.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal defect of the existing system is that it strives to do\r\nmodern work by ancient modes, an attempt which is as certain to fail in\r\npublic concerns as it would be if any one were sufficiently ill-advised\r\nto try it in private. And when there is contemplated on the one side the\r\nvast and growing mass of affairs cast upon the consideration of\r\nParliament, and on the other the rusty and creaking machinery employed\r\nto cope with it, little wonder can be felt that much needful work is\r\nleft undone, and a deal of that which is accomplished is done badly.\r\n\r\nBy granting to Ireland the right to manage her domestic affairs, and by\r\nproviding some system by which England, Scotland, and Wales can in local\r\nassemblies each deal for herself with her own concerns, much will be\r\naccomplished in the way of real parliamentary reform. But even then more\r\nwill remain to be done. The multiplied stages of each measure laid\r\nbefore the House of Commons must be lessened. It is possible to-day to\r\nhave a debate and a division upon the motion for leave to introduce a\r\nbill, upon the first reading, the second reading, the proposal to go\r\ninto committee, the report stage, the third reading, and the final\r\nproposition \"That the bill do pass,\" while financial bills have even\r\nmore stages to go through; and although, of course, all these\r\nopportunities for almost unlimited obstruction are not often made use\r\nof, they exist and should be diminished.\r\n\r\nAnother fruitful source of wasted parliamentary time is the provision\r\nthat if a bill is dropped at the end of a session, however far it may\r\nhave progressed short of actual passing, it has to be started afresh\r\nwhen the House re-assembles, and every stage has to be as laboriously\r\nagain gone through as if the measure had never been heard of before. One\r\ncan understand why a new Parliament should start with a clean sheet, for\r\nno decision of a previous one in favour of the principle of a certain\r\nmeasure can bind it to pass that measure into law. But within the limits\r\nof the same Parliament, a decision once given should be so far binding\r\nthat it should not be necessary for a bill to pass the stage of second\r\nreading four or five years running, because effluxion of time had\r\nprevented it passing into law during any of the sessions.\r\n\r\nAgainst such waste of time as this--waste which is imposed by the very\r\nrules under which Parliament works--the closure is no remedy. It is a\r\nweapon with which it is right that the majority should be armed, but it\r\nrequires great skill in the wielding lest the legitimate efforts of the\r\nminority be stifled. What is wanted is the better ordering of the whole\r\nmachine. When private bills and purely local business are taken\r\nelsewhere, when the stages of each measure are lessened, and when bills\r\nwhich have passed their second reading are not killed at the session's\r\nend, but allowed to remain in a state of animated expectancy, even then\r\nother means will have to be sought to make the machine move more surely\r\nand with greater expedition.\r\n\r\nSomething has been done to this end by the earlier hour of assembling\r\nand fixed hour of adjourning which the House has now adopted. But why\r\nshould not the process be carried further, and the affairs of the\r\ncountry be settled by day instead of by night? The first answer is that\r\nit would not be possible for a legislative body to do its business\r\nduring the day; and a sufficient answer should be that the French\r\nAssembly and the German Reichsrath do theirs during that period. The\r\nnext is that Ministers could not get through their work if the hours of\r\nmeeting were made earlier; the reply is to the same effect--that what\r\nFrench and German Ministers can accomplish, English Ministers must be\r\ntaught to do. A further contention is that such barristers and business\r\nmen as are members would not be able to attend sooner than at present;\r\nand the answer of many as to the barristers would be that it were well\r\nfor the country if three-fourths of those in the House never attended at\r\nall, for it is largely owing to the number of lawyers in Parliament that\r\nthe law is a complicated and costly process, often proving an engine of\r\ninjustice in the hands of the rich, and a ruinous remedy for the injured\r\npoor; while as to the business men who cannot attend earlier than now,\r\ntheir number is so exceedingly limited that their convenience ought not\r\nto be consulted to the detriment of parliamentary institutions. There is\r\none more argument which would be of greater weight than all the rest if\r\npresent conditions were likely to continue, and that is, that it would\r\nbe a serious hindrance to private bill legislation, because members\r\nwould be loth to serve on committees during the time the House was\r\ndeliberating; but it is obvious to all observers of the parliamentary\r\nmachine that the greater portion of private business will have soon to\r\nbe delegated to other bodies, and the main point of an undeniably strong\r\nargument will thus be destroyed.\r\n\r\nBut even such a reform in the hours of work would not expedite matters\r\nto a sufficient extent, if the present power of unlimited talk be\r\npreserved. Every member has the right of speaking once at each stage of\r\na bill, and as many times as he likes during committee. If the number of\r\nstages be lessened, as they are likely to be, there will not be much to\r\nbe objected to in the continuance of this right; but its retention\r\nshould be contingent upon the shortening of each speech. This is a\r\nproposal which can be justified on \"plain Whig principles,\" and has\r\ncertainly a plain Whig precedent. For Lord John Russell, when Prime\r\nMinister, brought forward in 1849 a proposal to limit the duration of\r\nall speeches to one hour, except in the case of a member introducing an\r\noriginal motion, or a minister of the Crown speaking in reply. The\r\nproposal fell through, but that it was made by so cautious a Premier is\r\na proof that there is much to be said in favour of compulsorily\r\nshortening speeches.\r\n\r\nThe proposition that Parliaments should be chosen more frequently in\r\norder that they may preserve a closer touch with the people should be\r\nearnestly pressed forward. In the early days of the House of Commons\r\nannual Parliaments were practically the rule, an assembly being summoned\r\nto vote supplies and do certain necessary business and then dissolved.\r\nWhen matters were put upon a more certain footing, after the Great\r\nRebellion, Parliaments elected for three years were ordained, and this\r\nterm was extended to seven years shortly after the Hanoverian Accession,\r\nin order to guard against a Jacobite success at the hustings, which\r\nmight seriously have endangered an unstable throne. The time has now\r\ncome to ask that a term adopted in a panic, and for reasons which have\r\nlong passed away, should be shortened. A four years' Parliament has been\r\nfound to be long enough for France, Germany, and the United States; and\r\nas the average of the last half-century has proved a seven years' period\r\nto be unnecessarily long for England, the briefer should be enacted. Now\r\nthat the suffrage is on so wide a basis, it is essential that members of\r\nParliament should be in as close touch with the people as possible. Once\r\nelected, members frequently forget that they are not the masters of\r\nthose who have chosen them, and that, though called in one sense to rule\r\nthe country, there is another sense in which they are called to serve.\r\nIt is necessary that this truth should be enforced upon such members as\r\nare apt to ignore it, and shorter Parliaments would enforce it.\r\n\r\nThere are some who believe that by payment of members a better\r\nrepresentation of the people would be secured. The example of other\r\ncountries can certainly be quoted in favour of such a proposition, but\r\nthere appears no necessity for any general payment in England. As,\r\nhowever, it is in the highest degree desirable that representatives of\r\nevery class in the community should appear at Westminster, some\r\nprovision should be made by which members, upon making a statutory\r\ndeclaration of the necessity for such a course, would be able to claim a\r\ncertain moderate allowance for their expenses during the session. There\r\nwould be nothing revolutionary in this; the fact of members being paid\r\nwould be merely a return to the practice which prevailed for close upon\r\nfour centuries after the House of Commons was established upon its\r\npresent basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--IS OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM COMPLETE?\r\n\r\n\r\nMany would be surprised if told that there remained serious deficiencies\r\nin our electoral system; and would ask, \"How can that be? We now have\r\nthe ballot at elections, household suffrage in both counties and\r\nboroughs, and a nearer approach to equal electoral districts than the\r\nmost sanguine Radical ten or even five years ago would have thought\r\npossible?\"\r\n\r\nBut has the suffrage really been extended to every householder? As a\r\nfact, it has not; it is largely a merely nominal extension; and tens of\r\nthousands of qualified citizens are disfranchised for years at a time by\r\nthe needless restrictions and petty technicalities which now clog the\r\nelectoral law. Registration should be so simplified that every qualified\r\nperson would be certain of finding his name on the list; and the duty of\r\ncompiling a correct register should be imposed upon some local public\r\nofficial, compelled under penalty to perform it.\r\n\r\nThe common belief is that a twelvemonth's occupation qualifies for a\r\nvote, but all that it does is to qualify for a place on the register,\r\nwhich is an altogether different matter, the register being made up\r\nmonths before it comes into operation. At the very least, a man must\r\nhave gone into a house a year and a half before he has a vote for it,\r\nand it often happens that he has to be in it for two years and a\r\nquarter, and even more, before he possesses the franchise. Let me state\r\nsuch a case. A man goes into a house at the half-quarter in August,\r\n1888; he will not be entitled to be placed on the register in the\r\nautumn of 1889, because he was not occupying on July 15 of the previous\r\nyear; if he continues to occupy, he will, however, be placed there in\r\nthe autumn of 1890; but it is not until January 1, 1891, that he will be\r\nable to exercise the suffrage. So that all taking houses from July 15,\r\n1888, are in the same position as those who take them up to July 15,\r\n1889, and will have to wait for a vote until 1891.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" it may be said, \"when a man once has his vote he is able to\r\nretain it as long as he holds any dwelling by virtue of 'successive\r\noccupation.'\" That is so only as long as he remains within the\r\nboundaries of the constituency wherein he possessed the original\r\nqualification. He may move from one division of Liverpool to another, or\r\nfrom one division of Manchester to another, or from one division of\r\nBirmingham to another, and retain his vote by successive occupation; but\r\nif he goes from Liverpool to Birkenhead, from Manchester to Salford, or\r\nfrom Birmingham to Aston, his vote is lost for the year and a half or\r\nthe two years and a quarter before explained. The effect of this is most\r\napparent in London, where thousands of working men are continually\r\nmoving from one district to another, treating the whole metropolis as\r\none great town, but by passing out of their original borough they are\r\ndisfranchised. And this is the more a grievance because the\r\nRedistribution Act, though dividing the larger provincial towns into\r\nsingle-member districts, left them as boroughs intact; while the old\r\nconstituencies in London were not merely divided, but split up into\r\nseparate boroughs. Lambeth thus became three boroughs--Lambeth,\r\nCamberwell, and Newington--each with its own divisions; Hackney was\r\nsevered into the boroughs of Hackney, Shoreditch, and Bethnal Green;\r\nMarylebone into the boroughs of Marylebone, Paddington, St. Pancras, and\r\nHampstead; and so throughout the metropolis. And the consequence of the\r\npurely artificial nature of the boundary lines thus created is that many\r\na man who merely moves from one side of the street to the other, or even\r\nfrom one house to another next door, is disfranchised for a couple of\r\nyears. The obvious remedy for this peculiar evil is that London should\r\nbe treated as one single borough, like Liverpool, Manchester, and\r\nBirmingham; but the remedy for the whole evil is that when a man has\r\nonce qualified for a place on the register, proof of successive\r\noccupation in any part of the country should suffice to give him his\r\nvote in the constituency to which he moves.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from the household to the lodger franchise, we are faced by\r\none of the hugest shams in the electoral system. There are certain\r\nconstituencies which contain hundreds of lodgers, and of these not more\r\nthan tens are on the register. The reason is twofold: it is not merely a\r\ntrouble to get a vote, but there is a yearly difficulty in retaining it.\r\nFor a lodger, as for a household vote, a twelvemonth's occupation is\r\nnecessary to qualify, and the purely nominal nature of this\r\nqualification is the same in both; but the lodger has the additional\r\nhardship of being deprived of even as much benefit as \"successive\r\noccupation\" gives the householder, for if he moves next door, though\r\nwith the same landlord, he is disfranchised, while the landlord retains\r\nhis vote. And, further, he has to make a formal claim for the suffrage\r\nevery succeeding summer, an operation too troublesome for the vast\r\nmajority of lodgers to undergo, and one from which the householder is\r\nspared. And thus this particular franchise is a mockery, and the\r\nproportion of lodger voters to qualified lodgers is absurdly small.\r\n\r\nOf course, the term \"householder,\" equally with the term \"lodger,\"\r\npresupposes at present that the one who bears it is a man, and, equally\r\nof course, an agitation is on foot to give the franchise to women. This\r\nis a matter which is likely to be settled in favour of the other sex,\r\nand the only question is as to how far it should go. The extreme\r\nadvocates of female suffrage would give it to married women, but what\r\nappears the growing opinion is that spinsters and widows, qualified for\r\nthe suffrage as men are qualified, should receive it; and this is a\r\nsettlement which will probably soon be reached.\r\n\r\nMuch dissatisfaction would continue to be felt, even were these points\r\ngranted, if \"faggot-voting\" were still suffered, or a single person\r\nallowed to possess a multitude of votes. The \"forty-shilling freehold\"\r\nis a prolific source of bogus qualifications: abolished in Ireland by\r\nthe Tories because it gave the people too much power, it ought to be got\r\nrid of throughout the kingdom by the Liberals because it leaves the\r\npeople too little. For it is largely by its means that some men are able\r\nto boast that they can exercise the franchise in six, or ten, or even a\r\ndozen constituencies. Men of this type occupy themselves at a general\r\nelection by travelling around, dropping a vote here and a vote there,\r\nand they ought to be restrained. That this can be done without violating\r\nany right is evident even under the present system. However many\r\nqualifications a man obtains, he can vote for only one of them in any\r\nconstituency; and more, if he has qualifications in every division of\r\nthe same borough he has, when the register is made up, to state for\r\nwhich division he will vote, and in that division alone can he claim a\r\nballot paper. If it is right to prevent him from having more than a\r\nsingle vote in any one division--or, which is a still stronger point, in\r\nany one borough--it must be equally right to limit him to a single vote\r\nthroughout the country. \"One man, one vote,\" should be the rule in a\r\ndemocratic state. If a person possesses qualifications for various\r\nconstituencies, let him be called upon to do what he is now compelled to\r\ndo if he has qualifications for different parts of the same\r\nconstituency--vote for only one of them; and that one should be the\r\nplace in which he habitually resides.\r\n\r\nAn indirect method of practically securing the \"one man, one vote,\"\r\nresult would be to have all the elections throughout the country on the\r\nsame day. Under the existing system, the polls drag on for weeks, and\r\nnot only does this distract the attention of the nation and put a\r\nhindrance to business for a far longer period than is necessary, but it\r\nhas the further evil effect of causing many voters in the constituencies\r\nwhich are later polled to waver until they see whither the majority\r\nelsewhere are tending, and then \"go with the stream.\" The only instance\r\nin recent electoral history when the later polls reversed the verdict of\r\nthe earlier was at the general election of 1885, when the boroughs,\r\nspeaking broadly, voted Tory and the counties Liberal; but that, owing\r\nto the recent extension of the county franchise, was an abnormal period,\r\nand the rule is that the stream gathers as it goes, and the waverers are\r\nswept into the torrent. That it is possible for a great country to be\r\npolled on the same day is evident from the examples of Germany and\r\nFrance, and it is only adherence to worn-out forms which prevents its\r\naccomplishment here.\r\n\r\nThe remedy, therefore, for the anomalies caused by the defective\r\n\"successive occupation,\" the presence of \"faggot voters,\" and the\r\nprolongation of the pollings, is simply to treat the kingdom as one vast\r\nconstituency, in which a man once on the register remains as long as he\r\nhas a qualification, in which no one has more than a single vote, and in\r\nall the divisions of which the poll is taken on the same day.\r\n\r\nThis suggested single constituency would, of course, resemble the great\r\ncounty and borough constituencies of to-day in having divisions, but it\r\nwould not be single in the sense proposed in Mr. Hare's original scheme\r\nof \"proportional representation,\" by which the possessor of a vote could\r\ncast it where and for whom he liked. Those who have adopted Mr. Hare's\r\nideas, while modifying his methods, have not been successful in\r\ndiscovering any feasible plan for representing public opinion in the\r\nproportion in which it is held, the sort of Chinese puzzle proposed by\r\nSir John Lubbock and Mr. Courtney having failed to commend itself to any\r\npractical politician. It is wrong, however, to imagine that the present\r\nsystem of single-member districts roughly secures that the minority\r\nshall be duly represented while the majority retains its due share of\r\npower; for it was proved in some striking instances, the very first time\r\nit was put in operation, that, so far from retaining, it often\r\nsacrifices the rights of the majority. At the general election of 1885\r\nthe Liberals of Leeds cast 23,354 votes, and the Tories 19,605, and yet\r\nthe latter gained three seats and the former only two; the Sheffield\r\nLiberals won but two seats with 19,636 votes, while the Tories secured\r\nthree with 19,594; and the Hackney Liberals could win only one seat with\r\n9,203 votes, and the Tories two with 8,870; while, on the other side,\r\nthe Southwark Tories, with 9,324 votes, returned one member, and the\r\nLiberals, with 9,120, returned two. The reason is obvious: a party with\r\noverwhelming majorities in one or two districts is liable to be beaten\r\nby narrow majorities in most of the divisions, and the minority thus\r\nelects a majority of members. The present system, therefore, is\r\nevidently imperfect. It was adopted in haste and without due\r\ndiscussion; it has failed in France, Switzerland, and the United States;\r\nand in at least the divided boroughs it ought to give place to double or\r\ntriple member districts.\r\n\r\nThe question of having second ballots, so as to provide that, as in\r\nGermany and France, where there are several candidates and none secures\r\nan absolute majority of votes given, another ballot shall be held, is\r\nnot an immediately pressing one, though much may be said in its favour;\r\nbut that of the payment of election expenses out of the rates ought to\r\nbe dealt with at once. It is highly unfair that a candidate should be\r\nfined heavily, by the enforced payment of the official expenses, for his\r\ndesire to serve the country in Parliament; and it is the more unfair\r\nbecause the official expenses of elections for town councils, school\r\nboards, and boards of health and of guardians are paid by the public.\r\n\r\nThis fine helps to keep men of moderate means out of the House, though\r\ntheir abilities might prove to be most useful there; and another method\r\nby which the wealthy have the advantage in parliamentary contests ought\r\nequally to be attended to. People are forbidden by law to hire\r\nconveyances for carrying voters to the poll, but they are allowed to\r\nborrow them, with the result that constituencies on an election day\r\nswarm with carriages of peers and other rich people, who have nothing\r\nwhatever to do with the district, and who yet affect by this influence\r\nthe voting. The use of carriages should not be prohibited, for the aged\r\nand infirm ought not to be disfranchised; but no importation of vehicles\r\nshould be allowed, and while an elector, and an elector only, should be\r\nentitled to use his own, it should, as a means of identification, be\r\ndriven by himself. Such a provision would largely diminish the present\r\ninterference of peers in elections. They may address as many meetings as\r\nthey like; but, as long as they have a legislative assembly of their\r\nown, they must not be allowed to use their wealth and position to\r\ninterfere with the voters for the Commons House of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.--SHOULD THE CHURCH REMAIN ESTABLISHED?\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the great concerns of the State it is natural to come to the\r\nChurch, and when that point is arrived at, the problem of\r\ndisestablishment at once arises. \"_Can_ the Church be disestablished?\"\r\nis a question sometimes put, and the answer is plain, for that answer is\r\n\"Most certainly,\" and a further question \"Where is the Act establishing\r\nthe Church?\" as if the non-production of such an enactment would prevent\r\nParliament from severing the link which binds Church and State, may be\r\nreplied to by another. Supposing one asked, \"Where is the Act\r\nestablishing the monarchy?\" would the non-production of that measure\r\nprove that it is not a parliamentary monarchy under which we live? By\r\nthe Act of Succession, Parliament \"settled\" the monarchy; by various\r\nActs in the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Elizabeth, and Charles\r\nII., Parliament has \"settled\" the Church. There is no authority in this\r\nrealm higher than Parliament; and if Parliament chooses to \"unsettle\"\r\neither monarchy or Church, it can do so.\r\n\r\nThis is no new-fangled Radical idea; it is an old Whig principle.\r\nCharles Fox, in a debate just a century since, observed, while\r\nfavourable to the principle of religious establishments, \"If the\r\nmajority of the people of England should ever be for the abolition of\r\nthe Established Church, in such a case the abolition ought immediately\r\nto follow.\" Macaulay, in his essay on Mr. Gladstone's youthful book on\r\n\"Church and State,\" was clearly of the same opinion. And Lord\r\nHartington, in his declaration a few years ago that if the majority of\r\nthe people of Scotland desired disestablishment their desire ought to\r\nbe satisfied, completed the chain of Whig traditional opinion.\r\n\r\nIf upon such a matter one is not content to swear by the Whigs, the\r\nverdict of the bishops may be accepted. Dr. Magee, of Peterborough, has\r\ndeclared that \"Our Church is not only catholic and national: she is\r\nestablished by law--that is to say, she has entered into certain\r\ndefinite relations with the State, involving on the part of the State an\r\namount of recognition and control, and on the part of the Church\r\nsubjection to the State.\"\r\n\r\nThe very use of the common term \"The Church of England as by law\r\nestablished\" involves recognition of the fact that what the law has done\r\nthe law can undo. And if any one doubts the power of Parliament in this\r\nmatter, let him read a table of the statutes passed in the session of\r\n1869, and he will find that the most important of all of them was \"An\r\nAct to put an end to the Establishment of the Church of Ireland.\" Now,\r\nthe legal position of the Irish Establishment and the English\r\nEstablishment was identical. Is any further proof required that, if\r\nParliament chooses, the latter can at any moment be severed from the\r\nState?\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that Nonconformist bodies are equally established\r\nwith the Church because they are subject to the law, as regards the\r\nconstruction of their trust-deeds, and other matters, of which the\r\ncourts of justice have occasionally to take cognizance. But that is as\r\nif it were argued that all persons who come within the enactments\r\naffecting the relations between employer and employed should be\r\nconsidered servants of the Crown as well as those engaged in the\r\ngovernment offices. The difference is plain: the law regulates all, the\r\nGovernment employs only some. The Crown appoints the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, but has no right to choose the President of the Wesleyan\r\nConference; Parliament can deal with the salaries of the bishops, but\r\ncannot touch the stipend of a single Congregational minister.\r\n\r\nThere being no doubt that, if the people will, the Church can be\r\ndisestablished, a further question remains, \"Ought it to be so dealt\r\nwith?\" and the reply in the affirmative is based upon the lessons of\r\nthe past, the experiences of the present, and the possibilities of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe Church, though possessed of every advantage which high position and\r\nvast wealth could supply, has failed to be \"national\" in any true sense\r\nof the word. So far from embracing the whole people, it has gradually\r\nbecome but one of many sects; and, had it not been for the efforts of\r\nthose who conscientiously dissented from its doctrines and its practice,\r\na great portion of the religious life we see in England to-day would not\r\nhave existed. Further, and from the time of its settlement on the\r\npresent basis, it has been the consistent friend to the privileged\r\nclasses, and foe to any extension of liberties to the mass of the\r\npeople. In defence of its position and emoluments it has struck many a\r\nblow for despotism. The harassing and often bloody persecutions of\r\nNonconformists and Roman Catholics in England and Wales, and of\r\nCovenanters and Cameronians in Scotland, were undertaken at its desire\r\nand in its defence; while the hardships and indignities inflicted for\r\ncenturies upon the Catholics of Ireland were avowedly in support of \"the\r\nProtestant interest\"--a Protestantism of the Establishment, in which the\r\nPresbyterians were allowed little share. In its pulpits were found the\r\nmost eloquent defenders of the English slave trade, which was from them\r\ndeclared to be \"in conformity with principles of natural and revealed\r\nreligion;\" and when Romilly strove to lessen the horrors of the penal\r\ncode, its bishops again and again came to the rescue of laws the\r\ndisregard of which for the sanctity of human life can in these days\r\nscarcely be conceived. And when it was proposed to give to some extent\r\nthe government of the country to the people whom it mainly concerned, it\r\nwas the bishops who threw out the first Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nAt this present the efforts of the better men within the Establishment\r\nare hampered by the State connection. It cannot bring its machinery into\r\nharmony with the growing needs of the time without appealing to a\r\nParliament in which orthodox and heterodox, Catholic and Atheist, Jew\r\nand Quaker, Unitarian and Agnostic sit side by side, and to which a\r\nHindoo has twice narrowly escaped election. By a Prime Minister\r\ndependent upon the will of this body its bishops are chosen; by a Lord\r\nChancellor equally so dependent are many of its ministers appointed.\r\nBecause of the necessity for going to Parliament for every improvement,\r\nlittle improvement is made. Private patronage is left untouched; the\r\nscandal of the sale of livings remains unchecked; criminous clerks are\r\noften allowed to escape punishment because of the cumbrous methods now\r\nprovided; and disobedient clergymen defy their bishops and go to prison\r\nrather than conform to discipline, the law which permits persistent\r\ninsubordination and provides an unfitting penalty remaining unaltered\r\nbecause Parliament has too much to do to attend to the Church.\r\n\r\nAs to the future, things are likely to be worse instead of better. Then,\r\nas now, the connection between State and Church will injure both--the\r\nState because it is an injustice to all outside the Establishment that a\r\nsingle sect should be propertied and privileged by Parliament, and the\r\nChurch because it is as a strong man in chains attempting to walk but\r\nonly succeeding to painfully hobble.\r\n\r\nIn how many ways disestablishment would benefit the Church, let Dr.\r\nRyle, Bishop of Liverpool, declare:--\"(1) It would doubtless give us\r\nmore liberty, and enable us to effect many useful reforms. (2) It would\r\nbring the laity forward into their rightful position, from sheer\r\nnecessity. (3) It would give us a real and properly constituted\r\nConvocation. (4) It would lead to an increase of bishops, a division of\r\ndioceses, and a reconstruction of our cathedral bodies. (5) It would\r\nmake an end of Crown jobs in the choice of bishops, and upset the whole\r\nsystem of patronage. (6) It would destroy all sinecure offices, and\r\ndrive all drones out of the ecclesiastical hive. (7) It would enable us\r\nto make our worship more elastic, and our ritual better suited to the\r\ntimes.\" True, the bishop adds that the value of these gains must not be\r\nexaggerated; but if disestablishment can do even as much good as this to\r\nthe Church, it cannot be the bad thing some of its opponents would have\r\nus believe.\r\n\r\nBut it is sometimes urged that if the Church were disestablished, there\r\nwould be no State recognition of religion, and England would become\r\nun-Christian. Is not this a technical rather than a real argument? Would\r\nthe number of Christians in this country be lessened by a single one if\r\nthe Church were deprived of State support? Was not the same thing said\r\nwhen Jews were admitted to Parliament and Atheists claimed admission?\r\nAnd has England ceased to be Christian because Baron de Worms is sitting\r\non one side of the Speaker and Mr. Bradlaugh on the other?\r\n\r\nA more real argument is that disestablishment would break up the\r\nparochial system; but those who use it impute a discreditable\r\nlukewarmness to their own community. Seeing what the Wesleyans, the\r\nCongregationalists, the Baptists, and the other dissenting denominations\r\nhave done to spread religion in every village in England and Wales; what\r\nthe Free Kirk has accomplished in Scotland; and what the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch has effected in Ireland--and all without a penny of State\r\nendowment, and dependent alone for success upon the gifts of their\r\nmembers--is it to be believed that the adherents of the Episcopal\r\nChurch, among whom are included the wealthiest men in the country, will\r\npermit that institution to perish for lack of aid? Is not experience all\r\nthe other way? Is not that of Ireland in particular a striking testimony\r\nto the wisdom of substituting the voluntary system for State support?\r\nUpon this point the testimony of two Irish Protestant bishops is\r\nabundant proof. The Bishop of Ossory, Ferns, and Leighlin averred, in\r\n1882, that \"no one could look attentively upon our Church's history\r\nduring the last ten or twelve years without perceiving that, by the good\r\nhand of God upon them, there had been a decided growth in all that was\r\nbest and purest and most important. Never in his recollection had their\r\nChurch been more clear or united in her testimony to Christian truth, or\r\nmore faithful in every good word and work;\" and Lord Plunket, the\r\nArchbishop of Dublin, has congratulated his clergy that disestablishment\r\nsaved the Church from being involved in the land agitation, adding, \"The\r\nvery disaster which seemed most to threaten our downfall has been\r\noverruled for good.\"\r\n\r\nThe question is likely, however, to be considered a more immediately\r\npressing one for Scotland and Wales than for England. In Scotland it is\r\nthe Presbyterian and not the Episcopalian form of Christian government\r\nwhich is State supported; and the fact that forms so opposed in striking\r\npoints of doctrine and practice should be established on the two sides\r\nof the Tweed, is an interesting commentary upon the system generally.\r\nWhen the majority of the members for Scotland demand disestablishment,\r\nand press that demand upon us, it will as assuredly be granted as was\r\nthe like demand from Ireland just twenty years ago. And \"the Church of\r\nEngland in Wales\"--supported by a small minority, and never enjoying the\r\nconfidence of the body of the people--should similarly be dealt with,\r\naccording to the wish of the Welsh parliamentary representatives.\r\n\r\nThe continued existence of the Church of England as an establishment is\r\nthe largest question of all, and it is one which politicians will have\r\nto face, if not this year or next year, yet in the early years to come.\r\nIt is only its continued existence \"as an establishment\" which is in\r\ndispute, for it would be a slanderous imputation upon its sons if it\r\nwere said that a withdrawal of State support would cause its collapse as\r\na religious body. The very strides it has made during the last few\r\nyears, which are sometimes urged in its defence, have been made not by\r\nState help but by voluntary effort; and if that voluntary effort had\r\nfree scope, the good effect would be greater and more lasting.\r\n\r\nWhat is wanted is that which Cavour asked, \"A Free Church in a Free\r\nState,\" for both would be benefited by the process, and particularly the\r\nformer. When the late Lord Beaconsfield was asked why, in the height of\r\nTory reaction, he made no effort to re-establish the Irish Church, he\r\nreplied that there was a difference between cutting off a man's head and\r\nputting it on again. But the illustration was imperfect, for it is a\r\nstrange kind of decapitation which strengthens the patient; and that was\r\nthe effect in Ireland. And the Irish Church was not only disestablished\r\nbut _disendowed_. In the mind of the practical politician the two\r\nprocesses are inseparable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.--WOULD DISENDOWMENT BE JUST?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question, \"Would disendowment be just?\" is admittedly a crucial\r\npoint to determine when the whole subject comes up for settlement, for\r\nthere are many defenders of the Establishment who exclaim, \"We are quite\r\nprepared for the severance of the Church from the State, but only upon\r\ncondition that she retains her endowments.\"\r\n\r\nBut the two concerns cannot be separated. Supposing the Government\r\nengaged an officer to perform certain functions, and that, in process of\r\ntime, finding these functions not fulfilled, it determined to sever the\r\nconnection, would the officer be justified in demanding not only\r\nconsideration for his long service and his life interests, but that his\r\nsalary should be paid to himself and his descendants in perpetuity,\r\nthough directly neither he nor they would again render service to the\r\nState? If it be contended that the illustration is not applicable,\r\nbecause the Church receives no aid from the State, issue can be joined\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nFor what is the first question that naturally arises? It is as to the\r\nsource from which the Church originally derived her revenues. \"Pious\r\nbenefactors, stimulated by the wish to benefit their fellows and save\r\nthemselves,\" is the reply of the average Church defender. But any\r\nattempt to prove this fails. Does a solitary person believe that every\r\nproprietor of land in each parish of England and Wales voluntarily and\r\nspontaneously imposed a tithe upon his possessions? Is it not an\r\nadmitted fact that it was by royal ordinance such an impost was first\r\nlevied, and by force of law that it has since been maintained?\r\n\r\nThis most ancient property of the Church in England, the tithe, is a\r\nlaw-created and law-extorted impost for the benefit of a particular\r\nsect. As far back as the Heptarchy, royal ordinances were given in\r\nvarious of the kingdoms of which England was composed directing the\r\npayment of tithes; and that the far greater portion of these were not\r\nvoluntary offerings is indicated in Hume's account of the West Saxon\r\ngrant in 854. \"Though parishes,\" he observes, \"had been instituted in\r\nEngland by Honorius, Archbishop of Canterbury, two centuries before, the\r\necclesiastics had never yet been able to get possession of the tithes;\r\nthey therefore seized the present favourable opportunity of making that\r\nacquisition when a weak, superstitious prince filled the throne, and\r\nwhen the people, discouraged by their losses from the Danes and\r\nterrified with the fear of future invasions, were susceptible of any\r\nimpression which bore the appearance of religion.\"\r\n\r\nWhen England became one kingdom, and tithes were extended by royal\r\ndecree to the whole realm, penalties soon began to be provided for\r\nnon-payment, Alfred ordaining \"that if any man shall withhold his\r\ntithes, and not faithfully and duly pay them to the Church, if he be a\r\nDane he shall be fined in the sum of twenty shillings, and if an\r\nEnglishman in the sum of thirty shillings;\" and William the Norman,\r\nspeedily after the Conquest, directed that \"whosoever shall withhold\r\nthis tenth part shall, by the justice of the bishop and the king, be\r\nforced to the payment of it, if need be.\" These provisions are part of\r\nthe common law of England, and they effectually dispose of the idea that\r\nthe tithe was a voluntary offering which the farmer to-day ought to pay\r\nbecause of the supposed piety of unknown ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of the tithe--which originally, according to Blackstone,\r\nwere \"distributed in a fourfold division: one for the use of the bishop,\r\none for maintaining the fabric of the church, a third for the poor, and\r\na fourth to provide for the incumbent\"--were the first great source of\r\nrevenue to the Church; but in the course of centuries that revenue was\r\nlargely added to by gifts. It was not uncommon for a man to hand over\r\nhis property to a monastery upon condition that he was allowed a\r\nsufficiency to keep him; while the money given for the provision of\r\nmasses for the dead was a considerable aid to the Church in the Middle\r\nAges. And as the monks were exceedingly keen traders, their wealth was\r\nincreased by farming, buying, and selling to a degree that at length\r\ntempted the cupidity of a rapacious king. It was during that period that\r\nour great cathedrals and all our old parish churches were built; and\r\nwhen, because of a divorce dispute, the Eighth Henry resolved to cut the\r\nChurch in England altogether adrift from the Church of Rome, he adopted\r\na measure of Disendowment which, though not complete, was very sweeping,\r\nand proved in the most absolute form the right of the State to deal as\r\nit willed with the property of the Church.\r\n\r\nIn the preamble of the Act dissolving the lesser monasteries, it is\r\ndeclared that \"the Lords and Commons, by a great deliberation, finally\r\nbe resolved that it is and shall be much more to the pleasure of\r\nAlmighty God, and for the honour of this His realm, that the possessions\r\nof such small religious houses, now being spent, spoiled, and wasted for\r\nincrease and maintenance of sin, should be used and committed to better\r\nuses.\" The State in this asserted a right it had never forfeited, and\r\nwhich, by successive Acts of Parliament, has been specifically retained.\r\nNo one to-day would defend the fashion in which Henry took property\r\nwhich had been devoted to certain public uses and lavished it upon\r\nfavourites and friends. The main point, however, is not the manner of\r\ndisposal, but the fact that it could be disposed of at all; and when any\r\none doubts the power of the State regarding the property of the Church,\r\na reference to what Parliament has done in the matter is sufficient to\r\nshow constitutional precedent for Disendowment.\r\n\r\nBut though much was taken from the Church at the Reformation period,\r\nmuch was left, and it was left to a body differing in many important\r\nparticulars from that which had been despoiled. As Mr. Arthur Elliott,\r\nM.P., a Whig writer, observes in his book \"The State and the Church,\"\r\n\"It would be to give a very false notion of the position of the Church\r\ntowards the State to omit all mention of the sources from which, as\r\nregards its edifices, the Church of England finds itself so\r\nmagnificently endowed. In the main, the wealth of the Church in this\r\nrespect was inherited, or rather acquired, at the time of the\r\nReformation, from the Roman Catholics, who had created it. The Roman\r\nCatholics and the English nation had been formerly one and the same.\r\nWhen the nation, for the most part, ceased to be Catholic, these\r\nedifices, like other endowments devoted to the religious instruction of\r\nthe people, became the property of the Protestant Church of England, as\r\nby law established.\"\r\n\r\nThe new Act of Parliament Church--for it had its doctrines and its\r\ndiscipline defined by statute--became possessed, therefore, of the\r\ncathedrals, the churches, much of the glebe, and a large portion of the\r\ntithe that had been given or granted to the Roman Catholic communion,\r\nwhich had held the ground for centuries. And succeeding monarchs, with\r\nthe exception of Mary, so confirmed and added to these gifts that \"the\r\nJudicious Hooker\" was led to exclaim--\"It might deservedly be at this\r\nday the joyful song of innumerable multitudes, and (which must be\r\neternally confessed, even with tears of thankfulness) the true\r\ninscription, style, or title of all churches as yet standing within this\r\nrealm, 'By the goodness of Almighty God and His servant Elizabeth, we\r\nare.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was not only \"His servant Elizabeth\" who, among monarchs since\r\nthe Reformation, has assisted the Houses of the Legislature to\r\npecuniarily aid the Church. Queen Anne surrendered the first fruits, or\r\nprofits of one year, of all spiritual promotions, and the tithe of the\r\nrevenue of all sees, in order to create a fund for increasing the\r\nincomes of the poor clergy; but Queen Anne's Bounty comes straight out\r\nof the national pocket, for, had our monarchs retained this source of\r\nincome, it would have been taken into account when the Civil List was\r\nsettled at the commencement of the reign, and at least L100,000 a year\r\nsaved to the Exchequer. And the nation has even more directly helped the\r\nfund, Parliament having, between 1809 and 1829, voted considerably over\r\na million towards it.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Dealing merely with national money appropriated to\r\nChurch purposes during the present century, it may be added that in 1818\r\nParliament voted a million sterling for the purpose of building\r\nchurches, that in 1824 a further sum of half a million was granted for\r\nthe same purpose, and that a subsequent amount of close upon ninety\r\nthousand pounds has to be added to the total. And not only by large\r\ngrants did Parliament help the Church. In the old days of Protection,\r\nwhen almost every conceivable article was taxed, the duty chargeable on\r\nthe materials used in the building of churches was remitted, this\r\namounting between 1817 and 1845 to over L336,000. A drawback was also\r\ngranted on the paper used in printing the Prayer Book, and this, while\r\nthe paper duty was levied, could scarcely have averaged less than a\r\nthousand a year. In small things, as in great, Parliament helped the\r\nChurch, for an Act of George IV. specifically exempted from toll the\r\ncarriage and horses used by a clergyman when driving to visit a sick\r\nparishioner.\r\n\r\nI claim, therefore, that the State has a right to dispose of such\r\nproperty of the Church as was not given to it in recent times by private\r\ndonors, knowing it would be appropriated to the purposes of a sect; and\r\nI claim it because the tithes were law-created, because the bulk of the\r\npossessions passed from one communion to another by force of law, and\r\nbecause the State has continued to pecuniarily aid the Church throughout\r\nthe centuries during which she has existed. And, if constitutional\r\nprecedent be demanded, they are to be found in abundance upon the\r\nstatute book, notably in the measures affecting the monasteries, the\r\nTithe Commutation Act, and the Act putting an end to the Established\r\nChurch in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIf it be urged, as it sometimes is, that, because the original royal\r\nordinance enforcing tithes was granted before our regular parliamentary\r\nsystem was in existence, Parliament has no power to deal with it, it\r\nmust be answered that in all matters within these realms, touching\r\neither life or property, Parliament is supreme. And, as bearing even\r\nmore directly upon the point raised, it may be added that rights of toll\r\nand market, granted to boroughs by royal charter before Parliaments were\r\nchosen as at present, have been altered and abolished by Parliaments\r\nsince; and that Magna Charta itself, signed many years before Simon de\r\nMontfort called the first House of Commons into being, has been\r\nmodified, and often modified, since that event.\r\n\r\nIf further proof be wanted, not only of the power but of the will of\r\nParliament to interfere directly in the monetary affairs of an\r\nEstablished Church, the Act disendowing the Irish Establishment eighteen\r\nyears ago, and another passed fifty years since, chopping and changing\r\nthe salaries of the English bishops, may be referred to. And, regarding\r\na further measure of the last half-century, the words of such a sturdy\r\nConservative as Lord Brabourne, used in a letter written in 1887, are\r\neminently satisfactory:--\"The Tithe Commutation Act was nothing more nor\r\nless than the assertion by the State of its right to deal with tithes as\r\nnational property.\"\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, the property, whether contributed by private\r\nbenefaction or royal grant, was distinctly given to the Church, and\r\nought not, therefore, to be taken away. I dispute both points of the\r\ncontention. The property was allotted to a Church which acknowledged the\r\nsupremacy of the Pope, and it is used by one which abjures it; to a\r\nChurch possessed of seven sacraments, and used by one with only two; to\r\na Church believing in transubstantiation, and used by one holding that\r\ndoctrine to be a dangerous heresy; to a Church with an unmarried clergy,\r\nand used by one in which the large families of the poorer parsons are\r\ntheir stumbling-block and reproach; to a Church which performed its most\r\nsacred mysteries in the Latin tongue, and used by one whose ceremonies\r\nare delivered in a language understanded of the people. If it be true\r\nthat the Church to-day is the Church as it has always been, why, in the\r\nname of common reason, was Cranmer, the Protestant, burned by Mary, and\r\nCampion, the Jesuit, hanged by Elizabeth?\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that the Church of England is not a corporation--that is,\r\nit has not property in its own right, and what is possessed by its\r\nmembers is vested in them not as proprietors but as trustees--there\r\nflows the consequence that it is mainly the life interests of those\r\nengaged in clerical work which have to be considered. And those life\r\ninterests will be considered and generously dealt with when the time for\r\ndisendowment arrives.\r\n\r\nAnd then comes a question which many will deem of all-importance--\"How\r\nis the Church to exist afterwards?\" or, to put the point in the\r\nextremest fashion, and in the words addressed to the clergy in the very\r\nfirst of the \"Tracts for the Times,\" \"Should the Government of the\r\ncountry so far forget their God as to cut off the Church, to deprive it\r\nof its temporal honours and substance, on what will you rest the claims\r\nto respect and attention which you make upon your flock?\" And the answer\r\nis that, if the Church be worthy to exist, it will be able, like other\r\nreligious bodies, to stand upon the open and constant manifestation of\r\nits own excellences.\r\n\r\nLook around and see what the voluntary system has done. In England it\r\nhas planted a place of worship in every corner of the kingdom; in Wales\r\nit has saved from spiritual starvation a populace neglected by the\r\nEstablishment; in Scotland it has founded a Free Church by sacrifices\r\nwhich were the marvel and the pride of a preceding generation; and in\r\nIreland it has secured to the mass of the people the ministrations of\r\ntheir own religion, despite every bribe, persecution, and lure. Is it in\r\nEngland, where the Episcopalian system has most that is wealthy and all\r\nthat is socially influential on its side, that a State endowment is\r\nneeded to provide for its professors what the miners of Cornwall and the\r\nlabourers of Carmarthen, the hardy toilers in the Highlands, and the\r\npoverty-stricken peasants of Connemara provide for themselves? If this\r\nbe so, then no greater indictment could be levelled against the process\r\nof Establishment, no more certain proof could be afforded of the evils\r\nwhich follow in its train, than that it produced such a mean coldness of\r\nsoul. But the supposition is so dishonouring to the great body of\r\nchurch-goers that its use proves the straits in which the defenders of\r\nthe existing system find themselves.\r\n\r\nDisendowment would undoubtedly reduce the larger salaries allotted to\r\nthe clergy, and probably increase the smaller. A parson would then be\r\npaid according to his value to the parish, whether as preacher or\r\nadministrator, and he would not draw a thousand a year for doing\r\nnothing, while his curate received eighty or a hundred for performing\r\nthe work. The Church would no longer be a rich man's preserve, wherein\r\nyounger sons could obtain comfortable family livings, while their duty\r\nwas done by ill-paid deputies. We should no longer see an Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, with a salary of L15,000 a year, begging upon a public\r\nplatform for worn-out garments for the poorer working clergy. A primate\r\nis conceivable at a third the cost, and the money thus saved to the\r\nChurch alone would prevent the necessity for such a humiliating\r\nproceeding as openly asking for old clothes for toiling clergymen. With\r\ndisendowment, in short, men would be paid according to their merits and\r\nnot their family connections--according to their work and not their\r\nbirth. And, further, the scandal of the sale of livings--the shame of\r\nthe public advertisement of cures of souls as eligible according as they\r\nare in a hunting country, or near a fishing river, or close to \"good\r\nsociety\"--would be done away with. Would all these gains count as\r\nnothing to the Church, considered as a religious body?\r\n\r\nThe process of disendowment, then, is the necessary accompaniment of\r\ndisestablishment; it is possible; it is just; and its effects would make\r\nfor good. It is necessary, because if the Church is to be severed from\r\nthe State on the ground that it has failed in its mission, it would be\r\nobviously out of the question to leave it possessed of the property\r\ngiven to it to secure that mission's due performance. It is possible,\r\nbecause Parliament is not merely supreme in all such matters, but has\r\nshown within the past few years its capacity for disendowing a Church\r\nhaving precisely the same rights and privileges as the English\r\nEstablishment. It is just, because no one sect has the right to property\r\ngranted it on the ground that it represented the religious sentiment of\r\nthe whole nation. And it would make for good in giving a more\r\ndistinctively religious character to the clergy, in paying them\r\naccording to their deserts and not according to the length of the purse\r\nthat purchased them their livings, and in freeing a religious system\r\nfrom the ignoble associations of the auction mart.\r\n\r\nUpon these grounds it is demanded that, with disestablishment,\r\ndisendowment shall come. Life interests will be respected; all modern\r\ngifts to the Episcopalians as a distinct sect will be fairly dealt with;\r\nfurther than this the Establishment is not entitled to demand, and\r\nfurther than this Liberals will not be prepared to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.--OUGHT EDUCATION TO BE FREE?\r\n\r\n\r\nA question which is intimately connected in many minds with the Church\r\nis that of national education. It stood next to it in order in that\r\nearly programme of Mr. Chamberlain which demanded \"Free Church, free\r\nschools, free land, and free labour.\"\r\n\r\nThis matter of free schools is not likely to create as much opposition\r\nas it would have done even a short time since, for no question awaiting\r\nsettlement is ripening so rapidly. Experience is teaching in an\r\never-increasing ratio that certain defects exist in our system of\r\nnational education which hinder its full development, some of which, at\r\nleast, could be avoided by the abolition of fees.\r\n\r\nThe progress which has been made in public opinion within only half a\r\ncentury regarding the amount of aid that should be given to elementary\r\nschools, encourages the hope that more will yet be given, and that very\r\nspeedily. It is but a little more than fifty years ago that a Liberal\r\nMinistry led the way in devoting a portion of the national funds to this\r\npurpose; and no one unacquainted with the history of that period could\r\nguess the number and the weight of the obstacles thrown in the way of\r\neven such a modest proposal as that Ministry made. The Tories, while not\r\nparticularly anxious that the mass of the people should be educated at\r\nall, were decidedly desirous that such teaching as was given should be\r\nunder the direct control of the Church. Archbishops and bishops, Tories,\r\nhigh and low, joined to continually hamper the development of any system\r\nof national education which afforded the Nonconformists the least\r\nprivilege; but despite their every effort the movement spread. The\r\nannual grant of L20,000, which was commenced in 1834, grew by leaps and\r\nbounds. In a little more than twenty years it had become nearly half a\r\nmillion for Great Britain alone; in thirty years it had increased by\r\nclose upon another quarter of a million; and in fifty years (and the\r\ngrowth in the meantime had been mainly the fruit of the Education Act,\r\npassed by the Liberal Ministry in 1870) it had touched three millions.\r\nAnd that sum, vast as it was, represented only the amount granted from\r\nthe national exchequer, being supplemented by an even larger total\r\nraised by local rates.\r\n\r\nSo far has the nation gone in the path of State-aided and rate-aided\r\neducation, and the question is whether it is not worth while to go the\r\ncomparatively little way further which is needed to make elementary\r\neducation free. For the fees which are now paid do not represent a\r\nquarter of the amount which the teaching costs. And not only so, but the\r\nexistence of these fees is a continual hindrance to the working of the\r\nAct. The effect of the fee is to keep out of the board schools thousands\r\nof children who ought to be in them; and the attempt to enforce its\r\npayment increases the odium which almost necessarily attends upon\r\ncompulsion.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" it will be said, \"where a parent is too poor to pay, the fee can\r\nbe remitted.\" That is true, and the extent to which the system of such\r\nremission is carried in some districts is one of the strongest arguments\r\nin favour of free education. It is desirable to get the children into\r\nthe schools, but it is highly undesirable to do this by practically\r\npauperizing the parents. If elementary education were free to all, all\r\ncould partake of it without any appearance of favour on the one hand or\r\nshame on the other. But the independent poor have now the choice of\r\nmaking themselves still poorer by paying the fee for the education they\r\nare bound to have administered, or of losing their independence by\r\nasking the school board or the poor-law guardians for relief. And the\r\nconsequence, of course, is that many who have no independence to lose,\r\nand are the least deserving of help, receive the assistance they are\r\nnever backward to ask.\r\n\r\n\"What is worth having is worth paying for\" is a remark sometimes made\r\nin this connection, but is it not as applicable to the State as to the\r\nindividual? For it is for no philanthropic but for a decidedly practical\r\nreason that the country assists education. All men in these days admit\r\nthat the most cultivated people, like the most cultivated individual\r\nman, has the best chance of success. With educated Germany, and educated\r\nFrance, and educated America pressing us hard, it is a necessity of\r\nexistence for England to be equally educated. And seeing that the school\r\nboard rate and the Government grant mount higher and higher and the fees\r\nbecome lower and lower, the only practical question is whether the State\r\nhad not better boldly step in, abolish fees which are a hindrance to\r\neducational progress, pay the whole amount instead of three-quarters,\r\nand provide free teaching for all.\r\n\r\nIf such a consummation were secured, the status of what are now called\r\nvoluntary schools would of necessity be materially altered. As at\r\npresent applied, the name \"voluntary\" affixed to the schools of the\r\nNational Society and similar bodies is very much a misnomer. It conveys\r\nthat the schools are supported by voluntary subscriptions; but this is\r\ntrue in only a limited degree, for it is the Government grant--that is,\r\nmoney taken out of the pocket of every one who pays taxes, direct or\r\nindirect--which keeps them in existence. And, therefore, when Churchmen\r\ncomplain, as some of them are occasionally ill-advised enough to do,\r\nthat they not only subscribe to their own schools but have to pay the\r\nrate as well, ought it not to be enough to remind them that their\r\nschools are supported not alone for educational but for sectarian\r\npurposes, and that, if they wish to proselytize, they must pay, in\r\nhowever inadequate a degree, for the privilege? The real hardship is\r\nthat those who do not believe in the clerical system of education have\r\nto pay heavily by means of taxation to keep up establishments over which\r\nthey have not the least control, and which are used by the clergy for\r\ndenominational ends.\r\n\r\nOne result, then, of free education would be, not to destroy the\r\nvoluntary schools, but to put them under the control of those who really\r\nand not nominally pay for keeping them up. If Churchmen demand schools\r\nof their own, they must support them out of their own pocket and not out\r\nof other people's, though it may be well that, under a stringent\r\n\"conscience clause\" and with direct popular control, they should still\r\nshare in the taxpayers' grants. As matters stand, the national\r\nschoolmaster is too often treated as if he were a mere servant of the\r\nclergyman, an idea which, with free education and popular government of\r\nall State-aided schools, would be bound to cease.\r\n\r\nThe cry raised by some clergymen when the Education Act was passed, that\r\nthe undenominational system would be fruitful only in producing \"astute\r\nscoundrels and clever devils,\" has died away. It is doubtful whether\r\nanybody ever really believed it; it is certain that no man with a\r\nreputation to lose would now repeat it. And, that being the case, the\r\nexcuse for keeping up at the public expense two rival sets of\r\nschools--one sectarian and the other undenominational--has so largely\r\ndisappeared that the onus of proving its necessity lies upon its\r\nadvocates, and the burden of paying for it should be shifted upon the\r\nright shoulders.\r\n\r\nOf course it is said that this proposal of free education is only\r\nanother step towards Socialism, but no one should be frightened by\r\nphrases. Socialism has as many varieties as religion--some as bad and\r\nsome as good--and from them must be selected those worth having. If,\r\nupon consideration of the whole case, free education be thought to be\r\none of these, the fact that it is called Socialistic will not weigh to\r\nits disadvantage with a single sensible man.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is it that is asked, and why is it demanded? It is asked\r\nthat elementary schools shall be freed from fees, and entirely supported\r\nout of the public funds, local and imperial; that advanced and technical\r\neducation shall be made cheap and accessible, in order that those who\r\nwant to progress can do so with as few hindrances as possible; and that\r\nall schools supported by public money shall be placed under popular\r\ncontrol, and the schoolrooms, out of educational hours, made available\r\nfor public use.\r\n\r\nThese things are demanded because by the present arrangements the\r\nprogress of compulsion is hampered, the deserving and independent poor\r\nare inequitably dealt with, and the cost of collecting the fees is out\r\nof all proportion to their value when received. Already the public pay\r\nthree-quarters of the cost of elementary education, and they do it for\r\nthe benefit of the community; if payment of the remaining quarter would\r\nincrease the efficiency of the system, even only to a corresponding\r\ndegree, it would be worth making. \"Vested interests\" might object; but\r\nthe national welfare must override them, though there is no intention of\r\ndealing with them otherwise than fairly. Due allowance would be made for\r\nthe subscriptions which have been raised towards the erection and\r\nsupport of the voluntary schools; but the nation has rights as well as\r\nindividuals, and, in considering any compensation which may be demanded\r\nby the managers of such institutions, if free education be adopted, the\r\npublic money which has been expended upon them must be taken into\r\naccount equally with the private.\r\n\r\nThis much is certain: although England will not be able to hold her own\r\nsimply with \"the three R's,\" and advanced and technical education\r\nshould, therefore, be widely spread, it is our duty to make \"the three\r\nR's\" as widely known as we can. It is not a question of principle, but\r\nof policy. Opposition to any education at all for the masses has\r\ndisappeared; the State and the parish already pay most of the cost; if\r\nthe system can be made more perfect by the abolition of fees, fees will\r\nhave to be abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.--DO THE LAND LAWS NEED REFORM?\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately the question of the land is touched, a whole host of\r\nopponents to progress are roused to fierce and continuous action,\r\nthough, as all politicians in these days affect a belief in the\r\nnecessity for land reform, the question appears at first to be more one\r\nof degree than of principle. But, at the very outset, it is necessary to\r\nface the fact that there is an active propaganda going on which denies\r\nthat any reform, even the most sweeping, will be of avail, and asserts\r\nthat it is the very existence of private property in land which must be\r\ndone away with.\r\n\r\nIn what is termed \"Land Nationalization\" a very dangerous fallacy\r\nexists. The first thing to be asked of any one who advocates it is to\r\ndefine the term. It is vague; it is high-sounding; but what does it\r\nmean? If it means that the State is to take into its keeping all the\r\nland without compensating the present holders, it proposes robbery; if\r\nit means that the process is to be accompanied by compensation, it would\r\nentail jobbery. There are thousands who, by working hard, have saved\r\nsufficient to buy a small plot on which to erect a house. Is that plot\r\nto be seized by the State without payment? And if fair payment be given,\r\nand the taint of theft thus removed, does a single soul imagine that a\r\nGovernment department would be able to manage the land better than it is\r\nmanaged at present? Are our Government departments such models of\r\nefficiency and economy that such a belief can be entertained for a\r\nmoment? What may fairly be demanded of all advocates of the\r\nnationalization or municipalization of the land is that they shall\r\nclearly show that the process would be honest in itself, just to the\r\npresent holders, and likely to benefit the whole community. Unless they\r\ncan do all these things, generalities are of no avail.\r\n\r\nThe land, it is sometimes urged, has been stolen from the people; but it\r\ncannot have been stolen from those who never directly possessed it: and,\r\nwhatever may be said of the manner in which the large properties were\r\nsecured centuries ago, much of the land has changed hands so often that\r\nmost, at least, of the present holders have fairly paid for it. There is\r\nan old legal doctrine that the title of that which is bought in open\r\nmarket cannot afterwards be called in question, and that applies to the\r\npresent case. And when we are told that there cannot exist private\r\nproperty in land because that commodity is a gift of God to all, is it\r\nnot the fact that, in an old country like ours, land is worth little\r\nexcept it be highly cultivated; that the labour, the manure, and the\r\nseed are private property without the shadow of a doubt; and that it is\r\nthese we largely have to pay for when agricultural commodities are\r\nbought? Upon the same ground it is sometimes contended that we should\r\nhave our water free because it falls from the heavens; but nature did\r\nnot provide reservoirs, or lay mains, or bring the pipes into our\r\nhouses; and for the sake of obtaining water easily we must pay for the\r\nlabour and appliances used in collecting and distributing it. And the\r\nvalue of these illustrations, both as to land and to water, is to teach\r\nan avoidance of sounding generalities and a resolve to look at all\r\nquestions in a practical light.\r\n\r\nRecognizing, therefore, that private property in land has existed, is\r\nexisting, and is not likely to be abolished, the duty of progressive\r\npoliticians is to see how the laws affecting it can be so modified as to\r\nbenefit a considerably larger portion of the community than at present.\r\nAnd three of the points which have been most discussed, and which now\r\nare nearest settlement, are the custom of primogeniture, the law of\r\nentail, and the enactments relating to transfer.\r\n\r\nAfter spurning for many years the Liberal demand for the abolition of\r\nthe custom of primogeniture--by which the land of a man dying without a\r\nwill passes to the eldest son, to the exclusion of the rest of the\r\nfamily--the Tories in 1887 themselves proposed it; and in the House of\r\nLords only one peer had sufficient courage to stand up in defence of a\r\ncustom which the whole peerage had sworn by until that time. It puzzles\r\nany one not a peer to understand how a distinctly dishonest practice\r\ncould have existed so long, save for the utterly inadequate reason that\r\nits tendency was to prevent large estates from being broken up, and that\r\nthere were those who imagined that large estates were a benefit to the\r\ncountry. In actual working, however, it did not affect the largest\r\nestates but the smallest, and primogeniture was thus a question touching\r\nmuch more closely those of moderate means than the possessors of great\r\nwealth. A large holder of land is an exceedingly unlikely person to die\r\nwithout a will; a small holder frequently does so, with the result of\r\nmuch injustice to and suffering among his family.\r\n\r\nA practical instance is worth a hundred theories upon a point like this,\r\nand here are some such which have come under my own notice within the\r\npast few months. A man possessed of a small landed property died\r\nintestate; his daughter, who had ministered to his wants for years, was\r\nleft penniless, the whole of the property going to the eldest son.\r\nAnother similarly circumstanced, whose stay and comfort during his old\r\nage had likewise been a daughter, shrank, with the foolish obstinacy of\r\nthe superstitious, from making a will; his friends, recognizing that, if\r\nhe failed in this obvious duty, the daughter would be thrown without a\r\npenny on the world, while the eldest son, who for various reasons had\r\nnot the least claim upon his father, would take everything, besought the\r\nold man to act reasonably; and almost at the last moment he did. In a\r\nthird case, a fisherman, who for eighteen years had been paying for a\r\npiece of land through a building society, was drowned in a squall; and\r\nhis savings, designed for the support of himself and his wife, were\r\nswept straight into the pocket of his eldest son. Now in all these\r\ninstances, had the money been invested in houses, ships, consols--in\r\nfact, anything but land--it would, in case of no will being made, have\r\nbeen divided among the whole family in fair proportion. The accident of\r\nit being put into land caused wrong and suffering in two cases, and\r\nwrong and suffering were very narrowly avoided in the third. The\r\nabolition of primogeniture, therefore, is much more needed by the\r\nworking and the middle classes than by the rich, whose lawyers very\r\nseldom allow them to die without a will.\r\n\r\nThe law of entail is on its last legs, as well as the custom of\r\nprimogeniture, and the Tories, by Lord Cairns' Settled Land Act, and a\r\nsubsequent amending measure, have practically admitted that it is\r\ndoomed. Entail affects the community by giving power to a man to fetter\r\nhis land with a multitude of restrictions for an indefinite period; it\r\nmakes the nominal owner only in reality a life tenant; and by cramping\r\nhim upon the one side with conditions which may have become out of date,\r\nand tempting him on the other to limit his expenditure on that which is\r\nnot wholly his own, the development of the land is impeded, and the\r\nprogress of agriculture hampered by force of law. Entail, like\r\nprimogeniture, has been defended on the ground that it tends to keep\r\nlarge estates intact; but it is now so generally believed that a more\r\nwidespread diffusion of land is desirable, that it is only necessary\r\nhere to state the argument.\r\n\r\nA more widespread diffusion of the land will not, however, be attained\r\nunless the process of transfer is at once cheapened and simplified. The\r\nlawyers reap too much advantage from the present system, and many a man\r\nrefrains from buying a plot he would like because the cost of transfer\r\nunduly raises the price. If it were provided that all estates should be\r\nregistered and their boundaries clearly defined, there would be no more\r\ndifficulty and expense in transferring a piece of land than is now\r\ninvolved in selling a ship. In these days buyer and seller are parted by\r\nparchments; and many who would like a plot, but who do not see why they\r\nshould pay, because of the lawyers, ten, or fifteen, or twenty per cent.\r\nmore than its value, put their money into concerns in which\r\nmeddlesomeness created by Act of Parliament does not mingle.\r\n\r\nSimpler and cheaper transfer would be a step towards the more general\r\nownership of land by those who till it. Let all artificial aids to the\r\nholding together large estates by power of Parliament be abolished, let\r\ntransfer be cheapened and simplified, and then let him who likes buy.\r\nFree trade in land is what we ask, and when it is attained land will be\r\nable to be dealt with the same as any other commodity, and those who\r\nwant a piece can have it by paying for it.\r\n\r\nBut although it may not be desirable for the State to interfere in\r\nEngland for the creation of a peasant proprietary, it is needful that\r\nParliament should do something tangible in the direction of securing\r\nallotments for the labourers. Upon that point, as upon primogeniture and\r\nentail, the Tories profess to be converted; but as their Allotments Bill\r\nof 1887 appears in practice to be a sham, it is necessary that such\r\namendments should be introduced as may render it a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.--SHOULD WASTE LANDS BE TILLED AND THE GAME LAWS ABOLISHED?\r\n\r\n\r\nA dozen or fourteen years ago the questions attempted now to be answered\r\nwere put much more frequently than at present. In the last days of the\r\nfirst Gladstone Administration and the earliest of the second Government\r\nof Mr. Disraeli, Liberals were looking for other worlds to conquer; and\r\nmany of them, not venturing upon such bold courses on the land question\r\nas have since been adopted by even moderate politicians, fastened their\r\nattention upon the waste lands and the game laws. No great results came\r\nfrom the movement; other and more striking questions forced themselves\r\nto the front; and we are almost as far from a legislative settlement of\r\nthe two just mentioned as in the days of a more restricted suffrage.\r\n\r\nThis is the more surprising because the points named are of practical\r\nimportance to the agricultural labourer, and the agricultural labourer\r\nnow holds the balance of political power. But it is not likely that this\r\nstate of quietude upon two such burning topics will long continue, for\r\nthe country voter is certain soon to profit by the example of his\r\nbrethren in the towns, and to demand that his representatives shall\r\nattend to those concerns immediately affecting his interests.\r\n\r\nAnd first as to the question of waste lands. Town-bred theorists who\r\nhave never walked over a mile of moorland are apt sometimes to talk as\r\nif all the uncultivated land in the country was in that condition\r\nbecause of the wicked will of those who own it, and to argue that, if\r\nonly an Act of Parliament could be secured, the waste lands would\r\nblossom like the rose. They have the same touching faith in the efficacy\r\nof legislation as had Lord Palmerston when he put aside some difficulty\r\nwith the exclamation, \"Give me an Act of Parliament, and the thing will\r\nbe done.\" But facts are often too strong for legislation, however well\r\nintentioned and skilfully devised, and those about much of our waste\r\nland come within the list.\r\n\r\nA large portion of uncultivated land is mountain and moor, the greater\r\npart of which it would be impossible to make productive at any price,\r\nand the remainder could not be turned to account under a sum which would\r\nnever make a profitable return. Those who think it an easy matter to\r\ncultivate waste land should visit that portion of Dartmoor which is\r\ndominated by the convict establishment. There they would see many an\r\nacre reclaimed, but, if they were told the cost in money and labour,\r\nthey would be convinced that, were it not for penal purposes, both money\r\nand labour might be put to better use elsewhere. And if it be argued\r\nthat the State should step in and advance all that is required to\r\ncultivate such waste as can by any possibility be brought under the\r\nplough, it must be asked why the taxpayer (for in this connection the\r\nState and the taxpayer are one and the same) should add to his burdens\r\nfor so small a return.\r\n\r\nBut there is, without doubt, a large amount of land in this country\r\nwhich now produces nothing, and which could be made to produce a deal.\r\nThat which is absorbed by huge private parks, scattered up and down the\r\nkingdom, forms a great portion of this; and though, for reasons which\r\nare mainly sentimental, one would not wish to see all such private parks\r\nturned into sheep-walks or turnip-fields, there is the consideration\r\nthat property--and peculiarly property in land--has its duties as well\r\nas its rights, and that those who wish to derive pleasure from the\r\ncontemplation of large spaces of cultivable but not cultivated land, and\r\nin this way prevent such from being of any direct value to the\r\ncommunity, ought to pay for the privilege. The rating of property of\r\nthis kind at the present moment is ridiculously low; it should at least\r\nbe made as high as if the land were devoted to some distinctly useful\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAs with parks, so with sporting lands. The rating of the latter is\r\nutterly inadequate; and although it maybe true that much of the land,\r\nespecially in England, devoted to sporting purposes, is of little value\r\nfor anything else, it is equally true that a great deal of it,\r\nparticularly in Scotland, is fit for cultivation, and that tenants have\r\nbeen cleared from it to make room for deer and grouse. In all cases\r\nwhere the land would have value if cultivated, the owner ought to be\r\nmade pay as if that value were obtained, seeing that for his own\r\npleasure he is depriving the community of the chance of obtaining\r\nincreased food. It would be too drastic a measure to adopt the Chinese\r\nmethod of hanging proprietors who did not till cultivable land; but many\r\na landowner, if made to feel his duty through his pocket, would do that\r\nduty rather than pay.\r\n\r\nFrom the question of sporting lands to that of the game laws is a very\r\nshort step. It may be that we have heard less of the latter during the\r\nlast few years, because the Hares and Rabbits Act, passed by the second\r\nGladstone Government in the first flush of its power, has done much to\r\nreconcile the tenant-farmers to the present state of things, by removing\r\nthe grievance they most keenly felt.\r\n\r\nThe Act referred to provides (to quote Mr. Sydney Buxton's summary)\r\n\"that every occupier of land shall have an inalienable right to kill the\r\nground game (hares and rabbits) concurrently with any other person who\r\nmay be entitled to kill it on the same land; that the ground game may\r\nonly be killed by the occupier himself or by persons duly authorized by\r\nhim in writing; that the use of firearms is confined to himself and one\r\nother, and they may only be used during the day; that those authorized\r\nto kill the game in other ways (poison and traps, except in\r\nrabbit-holes, are prohibited) must be resident members of his household,\r\npersons in his ordinary service, and any one other person whom he\r\nemploys for reward to kill the game; that tenants on lease do not come\r\nunder the provisions of the Act until the termination of their lease.\"\r\n\r\nThis was such a concession to the tenant-farmers that it is little\r\nwonder that those of them who had groaned under the ground game should\r\nhave felt generally satisfied with it; and although a wail has been\r\ngoing up from certain sportsmen that if the Act be not speedily amended\r\nthe hare will become as extinct as the mastodon, it is not the least\r\nlikely to be altered in the direction they wish. If amended at all, it\r\nwill be so as to bring winged game within its provisions.\r\n\r\nNo one acquainted with rural life can doubt that the game laws, as at\r\npresent administered, are a fruitful source of demoralization and crime.\r\nThey demoralize all round, for they pollute the seat of justice by\r\nallowing such game preservers as are county magistrates to wreak\r\nvengeance upon all who transgress upon their pleasures; they lower the\r\nmoral standard of the gamekeepers, whose miserable employment turns them\r\ninto spies of a peculiarly unpleasing description; they make the rural\r\npolice a standing army for the preservation of game; and they consign to\r\ngaol many a man who, but for these laws, would be honest and free.\r\n\r\nSuch as would see justice most openly travestied should sit in a country\r\npolice court and hear game cases tried. Let them notice the ostentatious\r\nfashion in which some magistrate, while a summons in which his game is\r\nconcerned is being heard, will (as is carefully noted in the local\r\npapers) \"withdraw from the bench\" by taking his chair a foot back from\r\nhis fellows and friends. Let them hear evidence upon which no man\r\ncharged with any other offence would ever be convicted. Let them see the\r\nvindictive sentences that are passed. And then let them go home and\r\nthink over the fashion in which that which is nicknamed \"justice\" is\r\nadministered to any man unlucky enough to have offended a gamekeeper or\r\na policeman, and to be charged as a poacher.\r\n\r\nIn the good old hanging days, a man was sentenced to death in a western\r\ncounty for sheep-stealing. The sentence was the usual one, but other\r\nsheep-stealers had been let off the capital penalty for so many years\r\nthat it was greatly to the astonishment of the district that this one\r\nwas hanged. Then people began to think, and, remembering that he had the\r\nreputation of being a clever poacher, they saw that he had been paid off\r\nfor the new and the old. It is much the same in the rural districts\r\nto-day. In game cases the presumption of the English law courts that a\r\nman shall be held to be innocent until he is proved guilty is\r\nsystematically reversed. The unsupported word of a gamekeeper is\r\nconsidered to be worth that of half-a-dozen ordinary men; and it is not\r\nuncommon for a defendant convicted of some offence, totally unconnected\r\nwith the game laws, to have his penalty increased because the\r\nsuperintendent of police has whispered to the justices' clerk, and the\r\nclerk to the magistrates, the fatal word \"poacher.\" Those who live in a\r\ntown can scarcely conceive the open fashion in which justice is degraded\r\nby the county magistrates when the game is in question. But, if any\r\nwould bring it home to themselves--and the strongest words are too faint\r\nto picture the reality--let them go to some rural court, where the\r\njustices do not imagine that the light of public opinion can be brought\r\nto bear upon them, and see how poachers are tried.\r\n\r\nIf it were only because of the widespread demoralization they cause, the\r\ngame laws ought to be repealed. They are avowedly kept up for the\r\nbenefit of the class which does little or no work, and they fill the\r\nprisons at our expense to preserve a sport in which we have no share and\r\nno wish to share. And, if they are to be retained on the statute book at\r\nall, their administration should, at the very least, be taken from those\r\nwho are practically prosecutor, jury, and judge in one, and placed in\r\nimpartial hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.--OUGHT LEASEHOLDS TO BE ENFRANCHISED?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal to enfranchise leaseholds--that is, to enable a\r\nleaseholder, upon paying a fair price, to claim that his tenure be\r\nturned into freehold--is a comparatively new one in the field of\r\npractical politics; but it has come to the front so rapidly that it is\r\nalready far nearer solution than others which have agitated the public\r\nmind for many years. The grievance had for a long time been felt, and in\r\nsome parts of the kingdom sorely felt; but a ready remedy had not\r\nsuggested itself, and the subject slept.\r\n\r\nThe grievance is this--that the present system of leases for lives or\r\nfor a term of years causes frequent loss to the leaseholder and much\r\ninjury to the community, benefiting only the owner of the soil. The\r\nremedy would be to empower a leaseholder to demand from the ground\r\nlandlord that the land shall be transferred to him upon payment of its\r\nfair value, as appraised by some public tribunal.\r\n\r\nAnd first as to the results which flow from the present state of things.\r\nThese vary with the circumstances, and some of the circumstances demand\r\nstudy. Leases, broadly speaking, are of two kinds--those which are\r\ngranted on lives and those which are for a specified term of years. Of\r\nthe two, the former are the more objectionable, as they frequently work\r\ngross injustice. A lease is granted which shall expire at the death of\r\nthe third of three persons named in the deed. Under that lease a man\r\nbuilds a house; the first life expires, and the leaseholder has to pay a\r\nfine--or, as it is called, a heriot--of a specified sum; the second\r\ndies, and another fine has to be paid; and when the third passes away,\r\nthe property and all upon it revert to the landlord. Is it not easy to\r\nsee that no particular chapter of accidents is required to terminate any\r\nthree given lives within a comparatively short period, while, if an\r\nepidemic occurred, ground landlords everywhere would reap a rich harvest\r\nfrom the ready falling in of leases for lives?\r\n\r\nOne instance out of thousands may be quoted of how the system works. \"A\r\npiece of land which let for L2 an acre as an agricultural rent was let\r\nfor building purposes at L9 an acre, and divided into eleven plots. On\r\none of these a poor man built a cottage, at a cost of L60, on a ground\r\nrent of 16s. 6d. The term was for three lives and one in reversion. The\r\ncharge for the lease was L5. On the expiration of each of the three\r\nlives L1 was payable as a fine or heriot, and L10 was to be paid on\r\nnominating the life in reversion. All the four lives expired in\r\ntwenty-eight years. The landlord thereupon took possession of the house.\r\nHe had thus received in twenty-eight years, besides the annual ground\r\nrent, the following sums:--L5 for the lease, L10 for nomination of life\r\nin reversion, L3 as heriot on the expiration of the three lives--in all\r\nL18; and, in addition, the house built at the expense of the victim,\r\nwhich he sold for L58.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply may be made, \"But, granting that leases for lives often have\r\ncruel results, is not the remedy in the hands of those who want leases?\r\nWhy do they take those for lives?\" For this reason--that in some parts\r\nof the country it is the only way by which a building plot can be\r\nobtained, and that, as long as the possibility of securing so good a\r\nbargain is legalized, so long will the more unscrupulous among the\r\nlandlords force an intending tenant to accept that or nothing.\r\n\r\nLeases for long terms of years do not as readily lend themselves to the\r\nchance of legal robbery, but they have their own ill effects. Houses are\r\nbuilt in flimsy fashion upon the express idea that they are intended to\r\nlast only the specified term; and during the expiring years of the\r\nlease, repairs are grudged, and the dwellings rendered unhealthy to the\r\noccupier and unsafe to the passers-by. If a man has a house which is\r\nerected upon leasehold land, and therein builds up, by his own skill\r\nand industry, a good business, he is absolutely at the mercy of the\r\nground landlord when the lease expires. The rent is raised because of\r\nthe success his own faculties have secured, onerous conditions in the\r\nway of repairs are imposed, and what can he do? \"If you don't like it,\r\nyou can leave it,\" is the landlord's reply; but there is many a business\r\nwhich does not bear transplanting, and if the tenant be on a large\r\nestate it might happen that, if he did not accede to the owner's terms,\r\nhe would have to move to a far-distant part of the town, or even--as at\r\nDevonport and Huddersfield among other places--out of the town\r\naltogether, and that would mean ruin. And thus he is practically\r\ncompelled to struggle on in order to increase the wealth of the\r\nlandlord, who has done nothing, at the expense of himself, who has done\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not always the worst, for in many cases landlords for\r\nvarious reasons will not renew at any price, and the tenant has perforce\r\nto go the moment his lease expires. A certain Whig duke--and, of course,\r\na zealous defender of \"the rights of property\"--conceived the idea, upon\r\ncoming into his estates some years ago, that a village stood too near\r\nhis park gates. Not brooking that herdsmen and traders should stand\r\nbetween the wind and his nobility, he directed that, as leases fell in,\r\nthe tenants should be cleared out, graciously, however, offering them\r\nother plots some three miles away. And the tenants had to leave the\r\nhomes in which they had been born and where their parents had lived\r\nbefore them, and to see them tumble down in utter ruin, in order that so\r\nmighty a person as a duke should not be shocked by the sight of the\r\ncommon herd. It was one of the thousand cases in life where a man had a\r\nright to do that which it was not right for him to perform.\r\n\r\nAnother fashion in which grievous injustice to the leaseholder can be\r\ndone is frequently illustrated. It has happened, and happened very\r\nrecently, that a ground landlord has granted leases for a term of years;\r\nthat, upon the strength of these agreements, houses have been built; and\r\nthat upon the landlord's decease it has been discovered by some skilful\r\nlawyer that the dead man had had no power, under an entail or\r\nsettlement, to grant such leases; whereupon the heir has invoked the law\r\nto cancel the whole, and has seized everything upon the land. This is\r\nlegal, but is it commonly honest?\r\n\r\nIn other ways the leasehold system is an injury not only to individuals\r\nbut to the community. A west country town, where all the land is held by\r\none man, has been crippled in every attempt to expand and improve by the\r\nimpossibility of obtaining a freehold plot. What person in his senses\r\nwould erect a substantial factory or a large concern of any kind upon a\r\ncomparatively short lease? Men embark upon such enterprises in order\r\nthat, as year follows year, their property may become more valuable, not\r\nthat year by year it may become less so by the growing nearness of the\r\ntime when it will pass to the landlord, who has never contributed a\r\npenny or a thought to the success of the concern, the building\r\ncontaining which, at the expiration of the lease, he can call his own.\r\n\r\nFor all these unfairnesses to individuals, hindrances to trade, and\r\ninjuries to the community, is proposed the remedy stated--that a\r\nleaseholder who has twenty (or, as some suggest, ten or fifteen) years\r\nto run, shall be empowered to demand that his land be made freehold upon\r\nthe payment of its value, as assessed by some specified tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe first objection is that this would be an undue interference with\r\n\"the rights of property.\" But it has already been laid down by\r\nParliament that such \"rights\" can be set aside in the public interest\r\nupon the payment of fair compensation; and what has been done in regard\r\nto the making of railways can be done respecting the building or the\r\npreserving of houses. The existing system is an injury to the community;\r\nand as the price to be paid for its abolition, whether wholly or in\r\npart, would be assessed by a tribunal constituted by Parliament, the\r\nlandlords would have no more reason to complain than they now have when\r\ncompelled to sell a portion of their property to a railway company.\r\n\r\nThe next plea is that it would interfere with \"freedom of contract.\"\r\nUpon the general question of what that freedom is, how far it now\r\nexists, and in how large a degree the State has a right to interfere\r\nwith it, one need not speak, for in this matter of leases Parliament\r\nhas already stepped in to \"interfere with freedom of contract.\" It\r\nhaving been found that some landlords were accustomed to insert in\r\nleases oppressive provisions for forfeiture in certain conditions, the\r\nLegislature empowered the courts to lift from the leaseholders covenants\r\nwhich unduly burdened them. And if a precedent is asked for the\r\nparticular remedy proposed, the Acts enabling any copyholder to\r\nenfranchise his holding should be consulted.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that, should such a power be granted by law, no one\r\npossessing land would let on a long lease, it may be answered that this\r\nwould be no great evil, seeing how the leasehold system has worked. But\r\nas landowners will want in the future as in the past to let or to sell,\r\nand as it is not to be supposed that any man will take a lease of less\r\nthan twenty years and build upon the land, the owners will accommodate\r\nthemselves to circumstances, and dispose of their property as best they\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nOwners in other countries do so, and why not here? Such a leasehold\r\nsystem as that of England is practically unknown elsewhere. In France,\r\nit is true, something of the kind exists, but we seek for it in vain in\r\nGermany and Austria, in Russia and Switzerland, or in Spain and\r\nPortugal; while in Italy, where no leases for over thirty years are\r\npermitted, a tenant can convert his property into freehold by redeeming\r\nthe rent.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of leasehold enfranchisement, therefore, have on their\r\nside not only the practical evils of the present system, but\r\nparliamentary precedent and continental custom. These should suffice to\r\npersuade all who study the matter that the time for a change has come,\r\nand that the way in which that change is proposed to be effected is just\r\nand equitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.--WHOSE SHOULD BE THE UNEARNED INCREMENT?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a school of politicians which reply to all such proposals as\r\nhave been sketched for practical land reform: \"They do not go far\r\nenough, for they would merely transfer the unearned increment from the\r\npresent freeholders to the present leaseholders, and we want it\r\ntransferred to the community.\" This \"unearned increment\" is a matter of\r\nwhich we are likely to hear a deal in the immediate future, for since\r\nJohn Mill stated the theory it has been much talked of, and to-day more\r\nthan ever. It is sometimes contended, in fact, that, supposing all the\r\nprojected reforms carried and in full and untrammeled action, \"the\r\nabsorption of the unearned increment by private individuals would\r\nperpetuate an evil which would swallow up whatever good those reforms\r\nmight have a tendency to bring about.\"\r\n\r\nWhat then is the theory upon which so much may depend? It cannot be\r\nbetter stated than in the words of Mill:--\"Suppose that there is a kind\r\nof income which constantly tends to increase, without any exertion or\r\nsacrifice on the part of the owners: those owners constituting a class\r\nin the community, whom the natural course of things progressively\r\nenriches, consistently with complete passiveness on their own part. In\r\nsuch a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private\r\nproperty is grounded, if the State should appropriate this increase of\r\nwealth, or part of it, as it arises. This would not properly be taking\r\nanything from anybody; it would merely be applying an accession of\r\nwealth, created by circumstances, to the benefit of society, instead of\r\nallowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a\r\nparticular class. Now this is actually the case with rent.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mill's \"Principles of Political Economy\" was published, this theory\r\nof the State absorbing, in whole or in part, the \"unearned increment\" of\r\nthe land, was regarded by many as so utopian that it was put aside with\r\na scoff, and was thought to have been settled with a sneer. But it has\r\nstruck deep root into many a Radical mind, and those who believe in it\r\nask it to be shown how it is either dishonest as a theory or would be\r\nimpossible in practice.\r\n\r\nThere need be no attempt to do either, for Mill himself made an\r\nimportant restriction in his definition of what should be done which\r\nrelieves it from the stigma of dishonesty or impracticability. He\r\nbelieved that \"it would be no violation of the principles on which\r\nprivate property is grounded, if the State should appropriate this\r\nincrease of wealth, _or part of it_, as it arises.\" It may be agreed\r\nthat the State could fairly appropriate a part of this increment, and\r\nthis might be done by means of taxation. But that is a very different\r\nmatter from taking the whole.\r\n\r\nOne who argues in favour of the latter plan, submits this\r\ncontention:--\"The area of a county, for purposes of illustration, may be\r\ntaken as a fixed quantity. Now, the demand for land will increase, and\r\nas a corollary the price of land will rise, exactly in proportion to the\r\nincrease of population. This additional value is not brought about by\r\neither independent industry, ingenuity, or the outlay of capital on the\r\npart of any private individual: it is a growth entirely due to the\r\nincrease of the community: it is of enormous value, is extracted from\r\nthe dire necessities of the whole population, and goes into the pockets\r\nof private individuals who have never done anything to create it.\"\r\n\r\nBut does the illustration hold good whether applied to such a limited\r\narea as a county or to the country at large? It is not the case that the\r\ndemand for land increases and its price rises exactly in proportion to\r\npopulation; and it is as little the case that its increased value, if\r\nany, is \"extracted from the dire necessities of the whole population.\"\r\nFor while the number of our inhabitants is increasing, the value of such\r\nland as ministers directly to their wants in the provision of food and\r\nclothing is decreasing. If all the bread that is eaten, beef that is\r\nkilled, and wool that is worn, were raised within these shores, there\r\nwould be a semblance of truth in the illustration; but we have left the\r\ndays when we lived on our own produce far behind, and the British farmer\r\nwould only be too happy if the picture thus presented were even\r\napproximately like reality.\r\n\r\nIt may be replied that bread and beef and wool do not exhaust the\r\ncatalogue of men's requirements from the land; and they do not, for we\r\nrequire plots upon which to build, and good houses are just as necessary\r\nas cheap food. But even where land is made more valuable by its becoming\r\nused for building purposes, is there any justice in either the State or\r\na municipality taking the whole increased value? Let the case be that of\r\na man who thinks that he sees a chance of a town expanding, and who\r\npurchases a piece of land which will be of little use to anybody unless\r\nhis idea proves correct, but which will bring him a good profit if he\r\nhas skilfully foreseen. Why should he not be as fairly paid for his\r\nskill and foresight as if he had bought a house on a similar belief? The\r\nreply is, \"The quantity of land is limited; that of houses is not;\" but\r\nthat is only true up to a certain and very definite point; and with the\r\nreforms which have already been suggested, and with a fairer system of\r\ntaxing the land, the community would gain all it could fairly ask.\r\n\r\nMy contention, shortly put, is this--That the State has a right to share\r\nin the increased value of all property, landed or otherwise; and that,\r\nin the case of land, it has an additional, though limited, claim,\r\nbecause of the conditions upon which that commodity passed into private\r\nownership. Those who work for wages have to pay income tax immediately\r\nthose wages touch a certain point; as they rise, so does the payment\r\nincrease; and, after a given amount, the tax is proportionately much\r\nheavier. Why should not the same principle be applied to income of every\r\nsort from land as to income of every sort from wages, profits, or\r\ninvested capital?\r\n\r\nIt is not so at present, as a study of the land tax will show.\r\nNominally that tax is four shillings in the pound on the full annual\r\nvalue, but actually what does it stand at? It was fixed by Parliament in\r\nthe seventeenth century, the semi-owners of the land, who had held their\r\nproperty under certain weighty conditions of contributing military\r\nstrength to the King, and who had managed by degrees to slip through\r\ntheir obligations, agreeing thus to tax themselves as a compensation for\r\nthe burden that had been lifted from them. But in 1798 it was\r\nenacted--by a Parliament in which practically only landowners were\r\nrepresented--that the valuation upon which the tax was to be paid should\r\nbe that of 1692, when on its then conditions it was first levied. And\r\nthe consequence is that, although this later Act directed that it should\r\nbe assessed and collected with impartiality, in parts of the country\r\nwhich have stood still the tax now is not far from the original sum,\r\nwhile it amounts in the immediate neighbourhood of such a city as\r\nLiverpool to about a fifth of a farthing in the pound. It may not be\r\nfeasible, because of the manner in which much of the impost has been\r\n\"redeemed,\" and it might in some cases be unjust, to raise the land tax\r\nat once to four shillings in the pound on the valuation of 1888 instead\r\nof 1692; but the same Parliament which put the clock back has the power\r\nto bring it up to the proper time; and, at least, something could be\r\ndone to lessen the loss the State is now made to suffer.\r\n\r\nThere is another way in which landowners could justly be called upon to\r\npay a portion of the unearned increment to the State, and that is\r\nthrough the taxation of ground-rents. This is a point which keenly\r\ntouches the towns, and deserves the early attention of Parliament. At\r\npresent the great ground landlords escape their fair share of the\r\nburdens which fall heavily upon those who take their leases. And, so\r\ncertain are some of them that the taxing time will soon come, that they\r\nare already selling a portion of their town estates, so as to \"get out\r\nfrom under\" before that period arrives.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be submitted that, with a fairer land tax and the\r\ntaxation of ground rents, we should secure to the State the proportion\r\nof the \"unearned increment\" to which she is justly entitled. Those who\r\nwould go further must be prepared to prove that property in land is so\r\ndifferent in every essential from all other kinds that it would be\r\nhonest for the State to absorb the whole unearned increment of the one,\r\nand to levy only an income and property tax on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.--HOW SHOULD LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT BE EXTENDED?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is always consolatory to find amid the welter of party politics some\r\ntopic upon which all say they agree, and such a topic certainly is that\r\nof the reform of local government. Politicians of every shade have long\r\nprofessed their desire for such a reform, and it ought now to be within\r\nmeasurable distance of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nUpon the great question of the extension of self-government to Ireland I\r\nhave already spoken; and in regard to the purely domestic affairs of all\r\nthe four divisions of the kingdom--England, Scotland, and Wales, as well\r\nas Ireland--it need only here be added that the solution of much of the\r\ndifficulty which springs from an overburdened Parliament will be found\r\nin devolving upon a special authority for each the right of dealing with\r\nits own local concerns. But, as to three of the four divisions, it is\r\nnot so pressing a question as that which is commonly known as the reform\r\nof local government, and the main proposition touching which is summed\r\nup in the demand for county councils.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter which more intimately touches the country districts\r\nthan the towns, for in all the latter of any size there are popularly\r\nelected municipal councils, which exercise much power over local\r\naffairs. The only exception is the greatest town of all, for London was\r\nspecifically exempted (by the action of the House of Lords) from the\r\nreform effected in all other cities and boroughs by the Municipal\r\nCorporations Act of 1835. There is a Corporation of the City of London;\r\nbut this body, against which a very great deal can be said, has\r\nauthority only over one square mile of ground, the remaining 119 square\r\nmiles upon which the metropolis stands being governed by vestries,\r\ntrustee boards, and district boards of works, all connected with and\r\nsubject to the Metropolitan Board of Works--or Board of Words, as it was\r\nonce irreverently but truly called--which is not chosen directly by the\r\nratepayers, but is selected by the vestries, who themselves are elected\r\nby handfuls of people, the general public paying them no heed. And thus\r\nit comes to pass that the greatest and wealthiest city in the world is\r\nworse governed than the smallest of our municipal boroughs, for nine out\r\nof ten ratepayers take not the least interest in electing the vestries,\r\nand not one ratepayer in a hundred could tell the name of his district\r\nrepresentative on the Metropolitan Board of Works, now proposed, by even\r\na Conservative Administration, to be abolished.\r\n\r\nIt is not a small concern, this of reforming the government of London,\r\nfor it affects four millions of people--a number not far short of the\r\npopulation of Ireland; but politicians in the mass, as even the keenest\r\nmetropolitan municipal reformer will admit, are more interested in the\r\ngeneral question of local government.\r\n\r\nSpeaking broadly, the defects of the system proposed to be reformed are\r\nthat of the popularly elected bodies there are too many, and that the\r\ngreat governing body is not elected at all. In a certain town of 3000\r\ninhabitants, there are at this moment a Town Council, a School Board, a\r\nBurial Board, and (because under the Public Health Act an adjoining\r\nparish was tacked on) a Local Board of Health; while, notwithstanding\r\nthat it sends representatives to a Board of Guardians for the whole\r\nUnion, it had until recently, and in addition to the other bodies, a\r\nLocal Board of Guardians, chosen under a special Act. And, beyond all\r\nthese, a Highway Board meets within its borders, which has to be\r\nconsulted and negotiated with whenever a road leading into the town\r\nneeds to be re-metalled or an additional brick is required for a\r\nneighbouring bridge.\r\n\r\nAs if all these boards were not sufficient to keep the district in good\r\norder, there is the Court of Quarter Sessions, which has jurisdiction\r\nin various details that the multitude of small bodies cannot touch.\r\nThese latter have one justification, however, that the former cannot\r\nclaim, and that is that, despite there being magistrates who are members\r\nof the boards of guardians by virtue of their office, and although the\r\nmore property one possesses the more votes one can give for certain of\r\nthe local bodies, these in the main are popularly elected, and are,\r\ntherefore, directly responsible to the ratepayers for the manner in\r\nwhich their trust is used.\r\n\r\nIt is quite otherwise with the Court of Quarter Sessions. This consists\r\nonly of magistrates, such magistrates being appointed by the\r\nLords-Lieutenant of counties, and the appointments being made mainly on\r\npolitical grounds. As a rule, the holders of that distinguished position\r\nare Tories, and they take good care that the magistrates shall be Tories\r\nalso. It is not long since it would have been impossible to find a\r\nsingle Liberal on the commission of the peace for Huntingdonshire; and\r\nwhen comparatively recently it was pointed out to the Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nEssex that an almost exactly similar state of things prevailed in that\r\nshire, he replied he did not consider there was a Liberal in the whole\r\ncounty who was socially qualified for the magisterial bench. The idea of\r\nmaking a banker or a merchant a justice of the peace was too shocking;\r\nand thus the commercial classes and a good half of the population\r\n(giving the other half to the Tories) were completely unrepresented, not\r\nmerely on the bench, but in the Court of Quarter Sessions, which\r\ngoverned the affairs and spent the money of the county.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity to prove that these courts have spent the county\r\nmonies wantonly or with conscious impropriety in order to show this\r\ncondition of things to be wrong. In imperial affairs, the doctrine that\r\ntaxation without representation is tyranny has been asserted to the\r\nfull; in municipal matters, since the Act of 1835, the same has\r\nprevailed; but in county concerns it has been non-existent. The\r\nmagistrates represent no one but themselves, their party, and their own\r\nclass; they are necessarily swayed by the passions and prejudices that\r\nparty and class possess; and, seeing that the English people long ago\r\nrefused power over the national purse to an unrepresentative body like\r\nthe House of Lords, it is surprising they have until now allowed power\r\nover the local purse to be in the hands of such equally unrepresentative\r\nbodies as the courts of quarter sessions.\r\n\r\nThe line which the immediate reform of local government must take is,\r\ntherefore, the creation of a directly-elected body to deal with county\r\naffairs, and the federation of such of the smaller boards as have to do\r\nwith the more purely district concerns, both of which points the Cabinet\r\nof Lord Salisbury appear disposed to concede. But upon the former point\r\nLiberals will claim that the whole--and not merely three-fourths--of the\r\nCounty Councils shall be directly elected, for the system of aldermen,\r\nincluded in the Municipal Reform Act by the House of Lords, has been\r\nused for partisan purposes, as it was intended to be, and the same\r\neffect will follow in the case of the counties if the same cause is\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nAny system, in fact, which involves \"double election\" tends to make the\r\nbody concerned hidebound and cliquish. A county alderman once chosen,\r\nespecially if he were a squire, as he most likely would be, would have\r\nto behave himself in most outrageous fashion ever to lose his post. The\r\nratepayers might grumble, but it would be difficult in the extreme to\r\ndislodge him, for he would be removed from their direct control, and the\r\nCouncil would consider it ungracious to get rid of an \"old servant.\" If\r\none wants to know how this double election operates, let him ask some\r\nclear-sighted Londoner who is acquainted with the manner in which his\r\nown city is ruled. He will be answered that for scandalous and wanton\r\nexpenditure not many bodies can equal the Metropolitan Asylums Board,\r\nthe members of which are mainly chosen by the various boards of\r\nguardians; while for jobbery and general mismanagement it is even beaten\r\nby the Metropolitan Board of Works, which is elected by the several\r\nvestries. And he will add that this chiefly arises from the fact that\r\nthe ratepayers have no direct control over either of these bodies, and\r\nthat the good result of such direct control was shown by this fact--that\r\nwhen the metropolitan ratepayers considered that the School Board, which\r\nis directly elected, was practising extravagance, they placed at the\r\nbottom of the poll those responsible for the policy, with the effect\r\nthat considerable savings were speedily effected.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore now, when County Councils are being established, all\r\nLiberals will have very carefully to watch the points upon which the\r\nTories and Whigs may combine in an attempt to give the country a\r\nsemblance without the reality of representative local self-government.\r\nWhat must be insisted upon is--(1) That the Councils shall be entirely\r\nelective; (2) that the ratepayers shall directly elect; (3) that there\r\nshall be no property qualification for membership; (4) that the voting\r\nshall be by household suffrage--one householder one vote; and (5) that\r\nwomen ratepayers shall have the same right of voting for county as for\r\ntown councils.\r\n\r\nWith such a Council in each county, or, in the case of Lancashire and\r\nYorkshire, in each great division of a county, we should have a central\r\nlocal organization, to which highway boards, local boards of health,\r\nvillage school boards, and other small bodies could be affiliated; and\r\nit is not impossible that, as a development of the system, the various\r\nbodies controlling the destinies of our lesser towns could be federated\r\nto save friction, trouble, and expense; while, above all, it must be\r\ninsisted that the representatives of the ratepayers shall have full\r\ncontrol over the police.\r\n\r\nIt is a truism that without good citizens the best of governments must\r\nfail; but our experience of the House of Commons and of the many town\r\ncouncils has shown that the improvement of the machinery and the handing\r\nover of control to the great body of the people have brought\r\npublic-spirited men to the front to do the duties required. As it has\r\nbeen at Westminster and in the towns, so will it be in the counties.\r\nEngland has become greater and freer, our towns have expanded and\r\nbenefited, owing to the whole of the inhabitants having a direct voice\r\nin the rule; and the counties will correspondingly improve when the same\r\nis applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.--HOW IS LOCAL OPTION TO BE EFFECTED?\r\n\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with the question of county government is that of\r\nlocal option; and the problem of transferring the licensing power from\r\nan irresponsible bench of magistrates to a specially elected body, or to\r\na direct vote of the ratepayers, has ripened towards settlement in a\r\nremarkable degree since the day--just twenty years since--when Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote to the United Kingdom Alliance that his disposition was\r\n\"to let in the principle of local option wherever it is likely to be\r\nfound satisfactory,\" and thus used in relation to this question for the\r\nfirst time, as far as is known, a phrase which has become famous.\r\n\r\nNo leading politician to-day disputes that some form of local option\r\nmust speedily be provided; but, as a body, they have been shy of\r\ntouching a problem that presents a host of difficulties, and the attempt\r\nto settle which could not fail to arouse a number of enemies. What\r\nthose, therefore, who wished for local option have had to do was to show\r\nthe body of electors that it was reasonable and just, and to trust that\r\ntheir appreciation of these two qualities would lead them to its\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nAs to its being reasonable, the very fact that the granting of licences\r\neven now is in the hands of the magistrates, and not in those of a\r\nGovernment department, indicates that it is intended that local feeling\r\nshall be consulted. This, in fact, was specifically stated in an Act of\r\n1729, which, after reciting that \"inconveniences have arisen in\r\nconsequence of licences being granted to alehouse-keepers by justices\r\nliving at a distance, and, therefore, not truly informed of the occasion\r\nor want of ale-houses in the neighbourhood, or the character of those\r\nwho apply for licences,\" enacted that \"no licences shall in future be\r\ngranted but at a general meeting of the magistrates acting in the\r\ndivision in which the applicant dwells.\"\r\n\r\nJust a hundred years later, Parliament thought fit to withdraw from the\r\nmagistrates--who, at the least, knew something of \"the occasion or want\r\nof alehouses in the neighbourhood, or the characters of those who apply\r\nfor licences\"--the power over applications for beerhouse licences; and\r\nthe result showed that even the most modified form of local option was\r\nbetter than none. The Act of 1830, \"to permit the general sale of beer\r\nand cider by retail in England,\" provided that \"any householder desirous\r\nof selling malt liquor by retail in any house\" might obtain a licence\r\nfrom the Excise without leave from the magistrates. Within five years\r\nanother Act had to be passed demanding better guarantees for the\r\ncharacter of those applying for such licences, the preamble declaring\r\nthis to be necessary because \"much evil had arisen from the management\r\nof houses\" created by the previous statute. Other amending Acts\r\nfollowed, and in 1882 the magistrates were once more given complete\r\njurisdiction over beer off-licences, with the result that in the borough\r\nof Over Darwen alone the renewal was at once refused of 34 out of 72\r\nlicences of the kind, a decision which, it is important to note as\r\nbearing upon a point yet to be raised, was upheld by the Queen's Bench\r\non appeal.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely a matter of historical interest, but it has very\r\ndistinctly to do with the argument in favour of local option, to show\r\nthat the magistrates for four centuries have had committed to them the\r\nduty of seeing that the needs of the district were no more than\r\nsatisfied. In 1496, a statute directed \"against vacabounds and beggers\"\r\nempowered two justices of the peace \"to rejecte and put awey comen\r\nale-selling in tounes and places where they shall think convenyent;\" and\r\nin 1552 another Act confirmed this exercise of authority. In 1622, the\r\nPrivy Council peremptorily directed the local justices to suppress\r\n\"unnecessary alehouses;\" and in 1635 the Lord Keeper, in his charge to\r\nthe judges in the Star Chamber previous to their going circuit,\r\ndenounced alehouses as \"the greatest pests in the kingdom,\" and added\r\nthis significant hint: \"In many places they swarm by default of the\r\njustices of the peace, that set up too many; but if the justices will\r\nnot obey your charge therein, certify their default and names, and I\r\nassure you they shall be discharged. I once did discharge two justices\r\nfor setting up one alehouse, and shall be glad to do the like again upon\r\nthe same occasion.\"\r\n\r\nThese facts show that the theory upon which our licensing system has\r\ngrown up is that the wants of a locality shall be strictly borne in\r\nmind, and of late years the wishes of a locality have more and more been\r\nconsidered. No one would deny that magistrates as a whole pay greater\r\nattention to those wishes to-day than they were accustomed to do even as\r\nrecently as fifteen years ago; and when new licences are applied for\r\nmemorials against their grant, signed by the inhabitants, are allowed to\r\nhave considerable weight with the bench. But that, after all, is only\r\nthe result of indirect and irregular pressure. What Local Optionists\r\ndesire is that the pressure shall be made direct and customary.\r\n\r\nThe reasonableness of demanding that local wishes shall control the\r\nissue of licences is proved by the facts adduced, and the justice is\r\nequally capable of being shown. If a locality determines that no fresh\r\nlicences shall be granted, or that certain old ones shall be taken away,\r\nno more injustice will be done than if the magistrates under the present\r\nsystem did the like. No compensation has ever been granted to the holder\r\nof a licence the renewal of which a bench has refused; and although the\r\nmajority of such refusals has been because of ill-conduct, there have\r\nbeen many cases (and those at Over Darwen were among them) where the\r\nmagistrates have not renewed because they did not think the house was\r\nrequired. The fact stands that a publican's tenure is in its nature\r\nprecarious; he holds his licence from year to year at the pleasure of\r\nthe magistrates; he would hold it in the same fashion were Local Option\r\nsecured. And the fact that the power of refusal to renew a licence would\r\npass from an irresponsible bench to either the whole of the ratepayers\r\nor a body specially elected by them for the duty, would not entitle him\r\nto demand a compensation then that does not exist for him now.\r\n\r\nA great difficulty of the problem lies in consideration of the manner\r\nin which the popular power shall be exercised. \"Local Option\" is a\r\nsomewhat elastic phrase, adopted by many who have never troubled to\r\nthink what it may involve. Broadly speaking, there are three methods by\r\nwhich it might be carried into effect: (1) By placing the power of\r\nlicensing in the hands of the Town Councils or the proposed County\r\nCouncils; (2) in those of specially-elected licensing boards; or (3) in\r\nthose of the ratepayers, who would exercise by ballot a \"direct veto.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the first plan that finds favour with most of our statesmen. It\r\nwas prepared to be adopted by the last Liberal Ministry, and is by no\r\nmeans so novel as many suppose. The Municipal Corporations Act of 1835,\r\nas originally drawn, contained a clause giving the Town Councils the\r\npower of granting alehouse licences, but the proposition was abandoned.\r\nThe Local Government Bill of Lord Salisbury's Administration has a\r\nsimilar provision, giving the licensing to the County Councils; but to\r\nthis has been urged the objection that these bodies will have sufficient\r\nbusiness to attend to without having the public-houses placed on their\r\nshoulders. When our system of popular education was fixed upon its\r\npresent basis, it was resolved that the work should be done by specially\r\nchosen school boards. Mr. Forster at first proposed that these boards\r\nshould in the towns be selected by the Municipal Councils; but it was\r\nfelt by the House of Commons that so special a function demanded direct\r\nelection, and direct election was provided, with the best results. And\r\nif the licensing power is to be vested in a representative assembly and\r\nlocal option is to be anything but a sham, it must be placed in the\r\nhands of those elected by the ratepayers for that special purpose, so\r\nthat no bye-issues of waterworks, or paving, or the increase of rates\r\nshall affect the one distinct question of the public-house.\r\n\r\nThe extreme temperance section argue that even such Licensing\r\nBoards--directly elected by the ratepayers for the specific\r\npurpose--would not meet the requirements of the case, and that nothing\r\nshort of a popular vote can be accepted. But why should the\r\nrepresentative system be abolished and a direct vote established in this\r\ncase, any more than in the equally burning questions settled every day\r\nby Parliament, and the lesser but still important matters decided by\r\ntown councils and school boards? We in England long ago made up our\r\nminds that the most excellent way to get public work done is to choose\r\nthe best men, give them the requisite authority, and then allow them to\r\ndo the duty to which they are called. And if we can disestablish a\r\nchurch, revolutionize the land system, or reform our institutions from\r\ntop to bottom through our representatives, without a direct vote of the\r\npeople, the question of renewing public-house licences can scarcely\r\ndemand so exceptional a process as is by some suggested.\r\n\r\nMy answer, therefore, to the question, \"How is Local Option to be\r\nworked?\" as well as to the kindred temperance question, \"How is Sunday\r\nclosing to be settled?\" is, \"By means of licensing boards, directly\r\nelected by the ratepayers.\" And if this solution be adopted, our\r\nlicensing system will be placed upon a basis at once more safe and more\r\nfree from friction or the likelihood of injustice than any other that\r\nhas been proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.--WHY AND HOW ARE WE TAXED?\r\n\r\n\r\nTaxes are the price we pay for being governed: they defray interest upon\r\nmoney borrowed and wages for protection and service. The fact that they\r\nare called by a name which is to many obnoxious, or that they are handed\r\nto the State instead of to an individual, ought not to blind us to their\r\nreal nature--that they are the price of services rendered. The name is\r\nnothing. In churches the money we pay is called a pew-rent or an\r\noffertory; in clubs it is a subscription; to doctors or lawyers a fee;\r\nto tradesmen a price; to railway companies a fare; for personal services\r\nwages; for the loan of a house rent; for life or fire insurance a\r\npremium; and for water a rate. All are in a measure taxes; and if it be\r\nanswered that the difference is that these payments are voluntary, may\r\nnot the same be said of much that is called \"indirect taxation\"?\r\n\r\nWhen the subject is considered, there are three questions which\r\nnaturally demand reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. Why are we taxed?\r\n     2. How are we taxed? and\r\n     3. How ought we to be taxed?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the first question some answer has already been given. Put in the\r\nsimplest fashion, the reply would be that it is cheaper to pay taxes and\r\nbe taken care of than not to pay them and have to take care of\r\nourselves. As members of an organized society, we have to provide for\r\nexternal protection and internal service--for the army and navy as a\r\nsafeguard against enemies from without, for the officers of the law as a\r\nsafeguard against depredators within, for the means of government, for\r\neducation, and for a large number of other matters designed for the\r\nsecurity of our persons and property and for the welfare and advancement\r\nof the community. We have further to pay the interest upon the National\r\nDebt--money borrowed by the State at times of emergency to prosecute\r\nsuch wars as Parliament had sanctioned.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, taxes are a substitution for personal service. The\r\nState in England once compelled this as a means of raising an army; and,\r\nthough this form of personal service was long ago commuted by the\r\npayment of a sufficient sum through taxation for the maintenance of a\r\nstanding force, the State has only waived, not abrogated, the right.\r\nEven as lately as the last century people in our country districts had\r\nto give six days in the year to the repair of such highways as were\r\nunder the management of the justices of the peace. In the one case the\r\npersonal service has been commuted into a tax, in the other into a\r\nrate--the difference being that a tax is imperially and a rate locally\r\nlevied--it being found that forced labour of the kind indicated is more\r\nwasteful and less efficacious than hired labour; and, if any want to\r\nknow how wasteful and how inefficient, they can find abundant\r\nillustrations in the history of the old _regime_ in France, or that of\r\nthe Egyptian fellaheen.\r\n\r\nThere has been indicated the difference between imperial and local\r\ntaxation--the one being a tax imposed by the State and the other a rate\r\nlevied by a local authority. The object in each case is similar; but,\r\nwhile the cost of the central administration, the army and navy, and the\r\nsuperior courts of justice, with the interest on the National Debt, is\r\npaid by taxes, that of lighting, draining, and other purely local\r\nmatters is defrayed by rates, and that of the police, the poor, the\r\nhighways, and education comes out of taxes and rates combined.\r\n\r\nSo much for the _why_ of being taxed; let us now consider the _how_. At\r\npresent the receipts of the State are derived from direct and indirect\r\ntaxation, together with a form which may be said to come under both\r\nthese heads. The most familiar mode of direct taxation is the Income\r\nTax; of indirect, the Customs and Excise; and of that which savours of\r\nboth, the stamp duties and the profits from the Post Office.\r\n\r\nThese methods of taxation are, as far as England is concerned,\r\ncomparatively modern. In the earlier days of settled government in this\r\ncountry, the mode of taxing was different and somewhat fitful, causing\r\nmuch trouble in the collection, and sometimes forming the pretext for\r\nrevolt. \"Aids\" to the King were a frequent means of oppression long ago;\r\nand as far back as the time of John they were felt as a grievance, Magna\r\nCharta providing that the King should take no aids without the consent\r\nof Parliament, except those for knighting the lord's eldest son, for\r\nmarrying his eldest daughter, and for ransoming the lord from captivity\r\n(the lord, it being remembered, holding at that time his land direct\r\nfrom the sovereign). \"Benevolences\"--a charming name for an unpleasing\r\nidea--were also in vogue in the Middle Ages, and, although specifically\r\ndeclared by an Act of Richard III. to be illegal, were levied in a\r\nfashion which caused much discontent. \"Loans\" were another form of\r\nraising money which the nation resented, as Charles I. found to his\r\ncost; while a \"Poll Tax,\" as all men know, drove Wat Tyler into\r\nrebellion. \"Subsidies\" and \"Tenths\" and other taxing devices equally\r\nfailed in the long run to answer the desired purpose of filling the\r\nNational Exchequer; and after the Restoration all such gave place to a\r\nsystem by which the Customs, the Excise, and the Land Tax provided most\r\nof the money required.\r\n\r\nGradually the proceeds of the Land Tax dwindled, and direct taxation was\r\nalmost extinct when, in the throes of the great war with France, which\r\nlasted, with slight intervals, for twenty-two years, the younger Pitt\r\nrevived it in an Income Tax, the form in which it is now mainly known.\r\nWith the end of the war this ceased, and the proceeds of indirect\r\ntaxation were again chiefly those upon which the State relied. What the\r\nresult was, how in every direction trade was hampered and public comfort\r\ndestroyed, has been summed up for all time in one of Sydney Smith's\r\nessays; and the quotation is worth re-perusal by everybody interested in\r\nthe subject, and especially by those who to-day are wishing to get rid\r\nof the main form of direct taxation we possess--the Income Tax, as\r\nrevived by Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\nUttering, in 1820, a warning to the United States to avoid that spirit\r\nwhich we now call \"Jingoism,\" Sydney Smith wrote--\"We can inform\r\nJonathan what are the inevitable consequences of being too fond of\r\nglory--TAXES upon every article which enters into the mouth, or covers\r\nthe back, or is placed under the foot; taxes upon everything which it is\r\npleasant to see, hear, feel, smell, or taste; taxes upon warmth, light,\r\nand locomotion; taxes on everything on earth and the waters under the\r\nearth--on everything that comes from abroad or is grown at home; taxes\r\non the raw material; taxes on every fresh value that is added to it by\r\nthe industry of man; taxes on the sauce which pampers man's appetite,\r\nand the drug that restores him to health; on the ermine which decorates\r\nthe judge, and the rope which hangs the criminal; on the poor man's\r\nsalt, and the rich man's spice; on the brass nails of the coffin, and\r\nthe ribands of the bride--at bed or board, couchant or levant, we must\r\npay. The schoolboy whips his taxed top; the beardless youth manages his\r\ntaxed horse, with a taxed bridle, on a taxed road; and the dying\r\nEnglishman, pouring his medicine, which has paid 7 per cent., into a\r\nspoon that has paid 15 per cent., flings himself back upon his chintz\r\nbed, which has paid 22 per cent., and expires in the arms of an\r\napothecary who has paid a licence of a hundred pounds for the privilege\r\nof putting him to death. His whole property is then immediately taxed\r\nfrom 2 to 10 per cent. Besides the probate, large fees are demanded for\r\nburying him in the chancel; his virtues are handed down to posterity on\r\ntaxed marble; and he is then gathered to his fathers--to be taxed no\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nLudicrous as the picture seems, it was correctly painted for the time it\r\ndepicted; and it is first to Sir Robert Peel and next to his greatest\r\npupil, Mr. Gladstone, that we owe the change from the harassing indirect\r\ntaxation of the past to the comparatively innocuous forms of it we have\r\nto-day. But it is still from indirect taxation that most of our revenue\r\nis derived. The heads of that revenue, as given officially, are--(1)\r\nCustoms, (2) Excise, (3) Stamps, (4) Land Tax, (5) House Duty, (6)\r\nIncome Tax, (7) Post Office, (8) Telegraph Service, (9) Crown Lands,\r\n(10) Interest on Advances for Local Works and Purchase Money of Suez\r\nCanal shares, and (11) Miscellaneous. Of all these, Excise stands first\r\nby several millions, while Customs are far ahead of any of the rest,\r\nStamps and Income Tax being the next best paying sources of revenue.\r\nAnd, in some form or other, every one among us--the peer who smokes a\r\ncigarette, the peasant who drinks a pint of beer, and the very pauper\r\nwho sends a letter to a friend--has indirectly to contribute his quota\r\nto the Exchequer, while all who earn more than L150 a year have to pay\r\nIncome Tax; and those who inherit property, probate, legacy, or\r\nsuccession duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.--HOW OUGHT WE TO BE TAXED?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt being certain that, as long as we are citizens of any sort of State,\r\nwe shall be called upon to pay for its maintenance, the question \"How\r\nought we to be taxed?\" is one of considerable moment to all. Grumble we\r\nmay, but pay we must.\r\n\r\nSome think they would solve the problem at a stroke by substituting\r\ndirect for indirect taxation. They argue that people should know exactly\r\nwhat they are paying for the service of the State; and that direct\r\ntaxation is not only a more logical but a more economic method of\r\nraising the revenue. They show that the consumer of duty-bearing\r\narticles pays not only the duty but a percentage upon it as interest to\r\nthe middleman; and a striking instance of this was afforded in the fact\r\nthat when, in 1865, Mr. Gladstone, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, took\r\nsixpence a pound off the tax on tea, the retail price of that article\r\nimmediately fell eightpence.\r\n\r\nBut it may be feared that those who argue in favour of entirely direct\r\ntaxation make small allowance for the weaknesses of human nature. I may\r\nprove to demonstration to the first person I meet that he is paying more\r\nthan he ought to do because of the working of the indirect system, and\r\nthat to this wastefulness is added the sin of ignorance as to what he\r\nactually does pay; but the chances are ten to one that he will reply\r\nthat, hating all taxation as the natural man does, he would rather not\r\nknow to what extent he was being mulcted, and that, if the whole amount\r\nwere annually and in a lump sum presented to his view, he would never\r\nfind it in his heart or his pocket to pay it.\r\n\r\nTo the sternly logical this attitude will appear sad, if not absolutely\r\nsinful; but we have to take man as we find him, and it is of little use\r\nattempting to run straight athwart his deepest prepossessions for so\r\nsmall a result as even the substitution of direct for indirect taxation\r\nwould attain. But there is a further point, which even the political\r\nlogician must bear in mind, and that is what the practical effect would\r\nbe of sweeping away all duties of Customs and Excise.\r\n\r\nIf we could secure a \"free breakfast table\" by liberating from toll tea,\r\ncoffee, cocoa, currants, raisins, and other articles of domestic\r\nconsumption, all would rejoice--though, in the present state of our\r\nfinances, no Chancellor of the Exchequer is likely to sacrifice the five\r\nmillions of revenue now raised from those commodities. But the English\r\npeople will think a good many times before striking tobacco, spirits,\r\nand wine off the Customs list, with the more than 13 millions they\r\nproduce, or spirits and beer off the list of the Excise, with the 13\r\nmillions in the one case and the 81/2 millions in the other that we now\r\nreceive from them. Even if any one can imagine for a moment that the 27\r\nmillions here involved could be made up by some new direct tax, it does\r\nnot need an extensive acquaintance with our social history to be aware\r\nthat the result of removing the duties from the various intoxicants\r\nwould be widespread national demoralization.\r\n\r\nThe taxation of the future, therefore, as of the past, will certainly\r\ninclude Customs and Excise. Some items may be struck off both; that a\r\nfree breakfast table can be secured should be no dream; and it may be\r\nfairly hoped that the hindrances to trade involved in such licences as\r\nthose for auctioneers and hawkers--who ought no more to be fined by the\r\nGovernment for practising their employment than butchers, bakers, or\r\nother traders--will soon be swept away. But upon beer, wine, spirits,\r\nand tobacco--their importation, manufacture, and sale--the tax-gatherer\r\nwill continue, and rightly continue, to lay his hand.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there will be no disposition to abolish the probate, legacy,\r\nand succession duties, but every disposition to strengthen them, and\r\nespecially the last of them. The \"Death duties\" at present are\r\ninequitably levied; great fortunes do not pay as large a proportion as,\r\nrelatively to small ones, they ought to do: and landed property is\r\nlightly let off compared with other forms.\r\n\r\nBut it is a comparative few who will be touched even by this much-needed\r\nreform; and taxation, to be fair, must touch all round. The Income Tax,\r\nobnoxious as from some aspects all will admit it to be, has almost\r\ninfinite capacities of being made useful to the State; and the question\r\nwhich practical statesmen will soon have to consider is the direction in\r\nwhich that usefulness can best be developed.\r\n\r\nAs at present levied, this tax does not affect those whose incomes are\r\nbelow L150; if their incomes are between that sum and L400, the tax is\r\npaid upon L120 less than the correct figure; while if they exceed L400\r\nthe full tax is levied.\r\n\r\nNow these regulations act unfairly in various directions. In the first\r\nplace, the tax starts at too high a figure. Until a few years ago it\r\nbegan at an income of L100--a deduction of L80 being allowed--and there\r\nis no reason why it should not begin at L50, so that every man earning a\r\npound a week in wages should be made to see as by a barometer how the\r\nnational expenditure was rising or falling--though it never falls. And,\r\nhowever little he might be called upon to pay, there would be a distinct\r\ngain in so many additional capable citizens knowing from experience what\r\nan extra penny on the Income Tax means, for they would thereby be taught\r\nmore closely to watch how the national money is got rid of, and their\r\npockets consequently made the lighter.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the regulations now in force make no distinction\r\nbetween a precarious and a settled income, causing the tradesman or\r\nprofessional man, whose revenue dies with him, to pay as heavily as his\r\nneighbour who has inherited or acquired property, of which those\r\ndependent upon him will not be deprived by his decease. As the point was\r\nput in a motion made many years ago in the House of Commons by Mr.\r\nHubbard (now Lord Addington), \"the incidence of an Income Tax touching\r\nthe products of invested property should fall upon net income, and the\r\nnet amounts of industrial earnings should, previous to assessment, be\r\nsubject to such an abatement as may equitably adjust the burden thrown\r\nupon intelligence and skill as compared with property.\" Upon this point,\r\nit is true, Mr. Gladstone has been antagonistic to the view here held;\r\nhe opposed this very motion, and years before it was introduced he\r\ndeclared that it was not possible for him to conceive a plan which would\r\nsecure the desired end. But it is also true that more than thirty years\r\nago, and in his very first Budget speech, he intimated that \"the public\r\nfeeling that relief should be given to intelligence and skill as\r\ncompared with property ought to be met, and may be met\"; and that as\r\nplans he could not conceive in 1853 have become realized achievements\r\nwith him before 1888, this concerning a differentiated Income Tax may\r\nyet be added to the number.\r\n\r\nThe words of Cobden upon the point are as true to-day as when they were\r\nuttered. Speaking upon the Budget of 1848, he dwelt upon the\r\ninequalities of the Income Tax, which was then still talked of by\r\nChancellors of the Exchequer as a temporary measure. \"Make your tax\r\njust,\" he said, \"in order that it may be permanent. It is ridiculous to\r\ndeny the broad distinction that exists between incomes derived from\r\ntrades and professions, and those drawn from land. Take the case of a\r\ntradesman with L10,000 of capital; he gets L500 a year interest, and\r\nL500 more for his skill and industry. Is this man's L1000 a year to be\r\nmulcted in the same amount with L1000 a year derived from a real\r\nproperty capital of L25,000? So with the cases of professional men, who\r\nliterally live by the waste of their brains. The plain fair dealing of\r\nthe country revolts at an equal levy on such different sorts of\r\nproperty. Professional men and men in business put in motion the wheels\r\nof the social system. It is their industry and enterprise that mainly\r\ngive to realized property the value that it bears; to them, therefore,\r\nthe State first owes sympathy and support.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a further injustice under the present system, and that is that,\r\nwhen a man has passed the L400 limit, he has to pay as heavy a\r\npercentage upon his income, precarious or permanent, as the wealthiest\r\nmillionaire among us. The struggling tradesman, the hardly-pressed\r\nprofessional man, every one who depends upon his brains for his living,\r\nhas to pay as heavily as the Duke of Bedford, the Duke of Westminster,\r\nand the Duke of Portland, to whom the brains they possess makes no\r\ndifference to their income, and whose property has been secured not by\r\nefforts of their own, but of others.\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder, then, that the demand should be growing for a\r\ngraduated Income Tax? It is one upon which Mr. Chamberlain has spoken\r\nplainly. At Ipswich, in January, 1885, he said--\"Is it really certain\r\nthat the precarious income of a struggling professional man ought to pay\r\nin the same proportion as the income of a man who derives it from\r\ninvested securities? Is it altogether such an unfair thing that we\r\nshould, as in the United States, tax all incomes according to their\r\namount?... Prince Bismarck some time ago proposed to the Reichstag an\r\nIncome Tax, to be graduated according to the amount of the income, and\r\nto vary according to the character of the income. We already have done\r\nsomething in that direction in exempting the very smallest incomes from\r\ntaxation. But I submit that it is well worthy of careful consideration\r\nwhether the principle should not be carried a little further.\" And at\r\nWarrington, eight months later, he observed--\"I think that taxation\r\nought to involve equality of sacrifice, and I do not see how this result\r\nis to be obtained except by some form of graduated taxation--that is,\r\ntaxation which is proportionate to the superfluities of the taxpayer.\r\nWhen I am told that this is a new-fangled and a revolutionary doctrine,\r\nI wonder if my critics have read any elementary book on the subject;\r\nbecause if they had, they must have seen that a graduated Income Tax is\r\nnot a novelty in this country. It existed in the Middle Ages, when those\r\nwho exercised authority and power did so with harshness to their equals,\r\nbut they knew nevertheless how to show consideration for the necessities\r\nof those beneath them.\"\r\n\r\nThe first answer to the demand for a graduated Income Tax will, of\r\ncourse, be that it would be \"confiscation\"--a word by which the rich are\r\never striving to frighten others from making them pay their proper share\r\nto the State; and one may be content to rest in this matter upon the\r\napparent paradox of Disraeli: \"Confiscation is a blunder that destroys\r\npublic credit; taxation, on the contrary, improves it; and both come to\r\nthe same thing.\" The fact, as has before been stated, is that taxation\r\nis the price we pay for protection; and the more we have to protect, the\r\nmore we ought to pay.\r\n\r\nAnd, as Mr. Chamberlain observed, this suggestion of a graduated tax is\r\nno new-fangled or revolutionary idea: it is one for instances of which\r\nit is not even necessary to go back with him to some vague reminiscences\r\nof the Middle Ages, for it exists in various degrees at the present\r\ntime. It is only dwellings of over the annual value of L20 that are\r\nliable to inhabited house duty; houses of less than L30 rateable value\r\nhave in various districts certain water privileges for nothing which\r\nthose of greater value have to pay for; and the difference in the death\r\nduties, according to the degree of relationship of the legatee,\r\nindicates that the law recognizes the reasonableness of graduating the\r\nburden according to the shoulders which have to bear it. And when we\r\ncome to the Income Tax itself, we find not merely that incomes under\r\nL150 are exempt, while those between that sum and L400 are subject to\r\nreductions which lessen the percentage of the tax to be paid compared\r\nwith those above the last given figure, but that no other a Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer than Mr. Gladstone has acknowledged the principle of\r\ngraduation, and that in the most practical way; for in his Budget of\r\n1859, when the rate of the tax stood at 5d. and he proposed to add\r\nanother 4d., he coupled with it the proviso that incomes from L100 to\r\nL150 (L100 being the then initial point) should pay only 11/2d. extra.\r\n\r\nThe argument sometimes used that the heavier taxation of large incomes\r\nwould tend to discourage thrift by putting a penalty upon its results is\r\ndisposed of by every-day experience. Does a man cease to wish to earn\r\nL150 because that sum will make him liable to Income Tax, or L400\r\nbecause that will bring him fully within its scope? We know such a man\r\ndoes not exist, and why should the conditions be changed if the\r\ngraduation went further than at present?\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the claim for a graduated Income Tax, and, after the\r\nexamples which have been given, it cannot honestly be argued that such a\r\nsystem is either immoral in design or impossible of execution. What is\r\nwanted is that the burden of taxation shall be equalized by fixing the\r\ngreater weight upon the shoulders that ought most to bear it. No single\r\ncitizen should be exempt from a share, and by preserving indirect\r\ntaxation upon luxuries and starting a direct tax at the lowest\r\nreasonable point, every one will have to pay something. But by\r\nrearranging the death duties and graduating the Income Tax we shall\r\nsecure that those who have most to lose, and, therefore, who demand most\r\nfrom the State, shall pay the State in proportion to their demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.--HOW IS TAXATION TO BE REDUCED?\r\n\r\n\r\nAt no moment in recent years was it more desirable to urge a demand for\r\nretrenchment in the national expenditure, and probably at no moment\r\ncould such a demand be urged with more chance of good result. For the\r\nrecent revelations made upon the highest authority as to the\r\nwastefulness which characterizes our Government departments have aroused\r\nin the public mind not merely indignation at the spendthrifts who rule\r\nus but determination to put an end to much of their extravagance.\r\n\r\nThe only way in which taxation can be reduced is to lessen the need for\r\ntaxes, and that can be done in no other fashion than by reducing the\r\nexpenditure. Ministry after Ministry has entered Downing Street with the\r\nannounced determination to exercise retrenchment, and Ministry after\r\nMinistry has left that haven for office-seekers with the expenditure\r\nhigher than ever. The stock excuse for this state of things is, that as\r\nthe national needs increase, the national expenditure must increase with\r\nthem; but, allowing that this will justify a rise upon certain items,\r\nthe question which will have to be pressed home to every Minister and\r\nwould-be Minister, to every member of Parliament and would-be member, is\r\nthis--\"Is the money that is disposed of spent in economical fashion and\r\nto the best advantage?\" And he will have to be a very thick-skinned\r\nspecimen of officialdom who will venture to reply \"Yes\" to the question.\r\n\r\nIn the estimates for the navy, the army, and the Civil Service, there is\r\nabundant room for the pruning knife, while to the principle which\r\nunderlies the granting of many of the pensions there ought to be\r\napplied the axe. Of course, as long as we possess an empire which\r\nexceeds any the world has ever seen for the vastness of its extent and\r\nits resources, so long must an army and navy be maintained; and even if,\r\nby a reverse of fortune, every one of our colonies were cut off from us,\r\nan army and navy would still be needed for our own protection. They are\r\nas necessary to a nation, situated like our own, as a fire-brigade to a\r\ntown; and it would be folly, and worse, to starve them into\r\ninefficiency. What money is needed, therefore, to place the defences of\r\nthe country--whether those defences be men, ships, forts, or coaling\r\nstations--in such a state of efficiency as shall avoid the chance of\r\nnational disaster should war burst upon us, ought to be definitely\r\nascertained and cheerfully granted.\r\n\r\nBut is the money now voted for the army and navy expended to the best\r\nadvantage, or is not a large portion of it wasted in useless and\r\nornamental adjuncts? We have not yet reached the point attained by that\r\nMexican force which is traditionally stated to have contained\r\ntwenty-five thousand officers and twenty thousand men: but the number of\r\nsuperior officers of both services is altogether out of proportion to\r\nthe size of the force. In order to stimulate what is called the \"flow of\r\npromotion,\" officers are placed on the retired list at a ridiculously\r\nearly age, and the country is deprived of, while having to pay for, the\r\nservices of those who are in the prime of life, and still capable of\r\ndoing their full duty, in order that room may be made for their juniors\r\nto climb into their places, those juniors themselves being soon\r\nsupplanted, and the \"flow of promotion\" going merrily on--at our\r\nexpense. And the hollowness of the pretension that all this is for the\r\ncountry's good is shown by the fact that, while a determined effort was\r\nmade by the Horse Guards to compulsorily retire Sir Edward Hamley, the\r\nfinest tactician England possesses, the Duke of Cambridge is suffered to\r\nremain commander-in-chief long after the age at which any other officer\r\nwould have been shifted. This is only one example of how all rules,\r\nsalutary and otherwise, are put aside when courtiership demands, for\r\nthere is a distinct danger, to which the country should be awakened, of\r\nour services being royalty-ridden.\r\n\r\nRoyalty, it is true, has not yet invaded the Civil Service, though the\r\nscions of the reigning house are so rapidly increasing in number that\r\nthe prizes even of this department are likely, at no distant date, to be\r\nsnatched from the skilled and deserving; but this particular Government\r\ndepartment has plenty to be purged of, notwithstanding. Put in the\r\nshortest fashion, the complaint the public have a right to bring against\r\nthe Civil Service is that it is over-manned and over-paid. A large\r\nsection of its members--and those located at the various offices in\r\nWhitehall afford a glaring instance--commence work too late, leave off\r\ntoo early, and even when on their stools have not enough to do. Their\r\nnumber should be lessened, and their hours increased. Ten to four, with\r\nan interval for lunch, is a working period so scandalous in its\r\ninadequacy that even the Salisbury Ministry has condemned it, and has in\r\nsome fashion, but at the country's expense, been striving to make it\r\nlonger. No private business could possibly pay if it adopted such a\r\nsystem; and what must be done is to treat the Government service upon\r\nthe same lines as a flourishing private concern. The old notion that a\r\nState should provide a maximum of pay for a minimum of work, and that a\r\nGovernment office should be a paradise for the idle and incompetent,\r\nmust be swept away. It is nothing less than a scandal that taxes should\r\nbe wrung in an ever-increasing amount from the toilers of the country to\r\npay for work which, under efficient management, could be better done at\r\na less price.\r\n\r\nWith this question of pay there is linked that of pensions. It is often\r\nurged that men join the public service at a less rate of pay than the\r\nsame abilities could obtain in other walks of business life, not merely\r\nbecause of the security of tenure, but because they know there is a\r\npension to follow the work. This is exceedingly to be doubted; and\r\nalthough it would be unjust to deprive of pensions those who have\r\nentered Government employment under present conditions, the question\r\nought very seriously to be considered whether it would not be wise for\r\nthe State to pay, as private firms do, for the services actually\r\nrendered, and for individual thrift to be allowed to provide for illness\r\nor old age. Or, if it be thought desirable to maintain the pension\r\nsystem, the Government servants should be called upon, like the police,\r\nto contribute out of their wages to a superannuation fund. The system of\r\npensions, as at present in operation, is indefensible upon sound\r\nbusiness principles, and taxpayers have something better to do with\r\ntheir money than continue to spend it for sentimental reasons.\r\n\r\nAs to hereditary pensions, there is no need to say much. Thanks to Mr.\r\nBradlaugh these are in a fair way to be disposed of; but it will still\r\nneed that a keen watch be kept, to prevent the State being further\r\nrobbed by any fanciful scheme of commutation. It may be taken as settled\r\nthat no further pensions will be granted for more than one life; but\r\npensions for a single life, as now arranged, often prove an intolerable\r\nburden upon the revenue. A favourite device of the Government offices is\r\nto \"reorganize\" departments, with the result of placing a new set of\r\nofficials upon the pay sheet and an old set upon the pension list. Many\r\nof the latter will be comparatively young men, capable of doing service\r\nin other departments; and, if they are not wanted in one, they ought to\r\nwork for their pay in another. But that is not the way in which the\r\nState does its business. They are pensioned off with such astounding\r\nresults as was seen in the case of one official, whose place was\r\nabolished in 1842, who was pensioned at the rate of nearly L2500 a year,\r\nand who lived until 1880; or of another, whose office was abolished in\r\n1847, who was pensioned in L3100, and who, up to this date (for he is\r\nbelieved still to be living), has drawn over L120,000 from our pockets\r\nwithout having done a single day's work for the money. And not only is\r\nthe \"reorganization\" system a means of lightening the national pocket\r\nwithout good result, but the \"ill-health\" device has the same effect.\r\nAnnuitants live long, as all insurance offices will tell you, and it is\r\nproved by the fact that there are pensioners still on the list who\r\nretired from the Government service between forty and fifty years ago\r\nbecause of \"ill-health.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, are some of the fashions in which the country is defrauded;\r\nthey could be multiplied, but the samples should suffice to arouse the\r\nattention of all who bewail the continual increase of taxation. The\r\nState is evidently regarded by a large section of the population as a\r\nhuge milch-cow, which shall provide an ever-flowing stream; and this\r\nview will continue to be held as long as our legislators are not forced\r\nby the constituencies to give due heed to economy. Nothing practical in\r\nthat direction can be done until the House of Commons has a thorough\r\ncontrol over the national expenditure. At present the control it\r\nexercises partakes so largely of the nature of a sham that it is not\r\nworth considering; its scrutiny must become active and persistent, and\r\nit should be directed to the pickings secured in high places as well as\r\nin low--to the receivers of heavy salaries as well as of light wages.\r\nThe tendency has too long been to exhibit economy in regard to the small\r\npeople and to pass over the extravagances which feed the large, and that\r\nis a tendency which will have to be stopped.\r\n\r\nNo one desires to lessen the efficiency of the public service; but as no\r\none would seriously dream of saying that that quality is at this moment\r\nits most distinguishing feature, good rather than harm would be done by\r\nthe exercise of sound economy. It is only by lopping off the\r\nextravagances which have grown up like weeds in our Government\r\ndepartments, and which are now choking much of their power for good,\r\nthat the taxes can ever be reduced. And so it is the bounden duty of the\r\nLiberals to raise their old banner of Retrenchment once again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.--IS FREE TRADE TO BE PERMANENT?\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the consideration of taxes, the question of Free Trade\r\nmust be dealt with. A very few years ago it would have been thought as\r\nunnecessary to discuss the wisdom of continuing our system of Free Trade\r\nas of lengthening the existence of the House of Commons; but we are\r\nto-day threatened with the revival of a Protectionist agitation, and it\r\nis necessary to be argumentatively prepared for it.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible within my limits to say all that can be said in favour\r\nof Free Trade or all that ought to be said against Protection; but it\r\nshould be the less necessary to do the former, because the proof that it\r\nis working evil to the country must rest with those who assert it, and\r\nthat proof they do not afford.\r\n\r\nThe main contention of the Protectionists--Fair Traders some of them\r\ncall themselves, but the old distinctive name is preferable--is that the\r\nfree importation of corn has ruined agriculture, and of other goods has\r\ncrippled manufactures. And, having assumed this to be correct, their\r\nremedy is to place such a duty upon all imported articles which compete\r\nwith our own productions as to \"protect British industry.\"\r\n\r\nFirst for the complaint. Is it true that the system of free imports has\r\nruined agriculture and crippled manufactures? There is no doubt that the\r\nfarming interest has been very seriously hit by a series of inadequate\r\nharvests and the growth of foreign competition; and there is as little\r\ndoubt that, if such a duty were placed upon imported grain as would make\r\nits culture in England profitable under the present conditions, the\r\nfarmers would thrive, even if the poorer among us starved. No one can\r\ndeny that, if there is to be Protection at all, the agricultural\r\ninterest demands it the most, but we will see directly whether such a\r\ntariff as would make profitable the growth of wheat is practicable. As\r\nto the crippling of manufactures, there is something to be said which is\r\nas true as it may be unpalatable. Without denying that the free\r\nimportation of foreign goods, coupled with the heavy duties levied by\r\nother countries upon our exported articles, has seriously diminished the\r\nprofits of certain of our manufacturers, and has thereby injured the\r\npersons by them employed, those who have watched the recent course of\r\nBritish trade are compelled to see that other causes have been at work\r\nto account for much of the depression.\r\n\r\nMaking haste to be rich has had more to do with that depression than the\r\nweight of foreign competition. Manufacturers who scamp and merchants who\r\nswindle; folks who endow churches or build chapels to compromise with\r\ntheir conscience for robbing their customers and blasting the honour of\r\nthe English name--these are the men who deserve to be pilloried when we\r\ntalk of depression. We _do_ want fair trade in the sense of honest\r\ntrade, for it is the burning desire for gain, the resolve to practise\r\nany device that leads to money-making, which is injuring the British\r\nmanufacturing industry far more than the foreigner. The sick man who\r\ndisliked a wash was at last, in desperation, recommended by his doctor\r\nto try soap; the manufacturers who size their cottons to the rotting\r\npoint, and the merchants who have been accustomed to sell German cutlery\r\nwith a Sheffield label, should be told, when they cry out upon\r\ndepression, to try honesty. And when they whine, as they sometimes do,\r\nthat it is the demand for cheap goods that makes such a supply, they\r\nmust be reminded that the butcher who sells bad meat, or the baker who\r\nadulterates his bread, pleads the same excuse, but it does not save\r\neither from being branded as a cheat.\r\n\r\nThere is a further point which will account for the loss of British\r\ntrade in foreign markets, and that is the lack of adaptability to new\r\ncircumstances shown by English traders. And this is displayed all\r\nround. Our farmers ought to know by this time that they cannot compete\r\nby wheat-growing with the United States, Canada, or India; but they will\r\nnot comprehend that they can compete with foreign countries in the\r\nmatter of butter, eggs, cheese, fruit, and poultry. And the consequence\r\nis that we are paying many millions yearly to France, Holland, Belgium,\r\nand America for articles that our own farmers ought to supply; and that\r\nthe largest cheesemongers in London find it cheaper, easier, and quicker\r\nto import all their butter from Normandy than to buy a single pound in\r\nEngland. It is the same with our manufacturers. An American firm had a\r\nlarge order to give for cutlery; they asked terms which the English\r\nmanufacturer rejected because they were novel; and a German at once\r\nseized the chance, and kept the trade. In New Zealand there was wanted a\r\nlight spade for agricultural purposes; the English manufacturer would\r\nnot alter his pattern to suit his customers; and the whole order went to\r\nthe United States. In China the people wish for a cotton cloth which\r\nwill not vanish at the first shower of rain; Manchester is so accustomed\r\nto heavily size its goods that it cannot change; and the China trade in\r\nthat commodity is going elsewhere. Before, then, we complain of foreign\r\ncompetition--a complaint which is bitterly heard to-day as against\r\nEngland in France, Germany, Austria, and the United States--let us be\r\ncertain that we are doing all we honestly can to cope with it.\r\n\r\nSome there are who say that they are in favour of Free Trade in the\r\nabstract, but that they will not support it as long as it is not\r\naccepted by other nations. This is about as sensible as a decision to\r\ncheat in business as long as some of our neighbours cheat would be\r\nhonest, and is exactly on a level with the old death-bed injunction of\r\nthe miserly parent--\"My son, make money--honestly if you can, but make\r\nmoney.\" And when it is stated, as it sometimes is, that Free Trade was\r\nadopted by this country only on the understanding that it would be\r\nuniversally agreed to, it is a sufficient answer that Sir Robert Peel,\r\nin introducing his measure for the repeal of the Corn Laws,\r\nobserved:--\"I fairly avow to you that in making this great reduction\r\nupon the import of articles, the produce and manufacture of foreign\r\ncountries, I have no guarantee to give you that other countries will\r\nimmediately follow our example.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Protectionists, call themselves by what name they will and use\r\nwhat arguments they may, ask us to change our present system, we first\r\nthen deny their assumption that England is going to the dogs, and next\r\nwe ask what they propose to put in its place. Upon a plan they find it\r\nimpossible to agree. Some would tax corn lightly, others as heavily as\r\nwould be required to make its growth certainly profitable to the farmer;\r\nsome would fix a duty only upon manufactured articles, others upon\r\neverything which is imported that can be raised here; some would admit\r\ngoods from our colonies at a lighter rate than from foreign countries,\r\nothers would put them all on the same level. Out of this chaos of\r\ncontradictions no definite plan has yet been evolved, and none is likely\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nThe corn question is the first difficulty, and will long remain so.\r\nWheat, in the autumn of 1887, was selling at 28s. a quarter; on the\r\naverage it cannot be grown to pay at less than 45s.; yet it is only a\r\n5s. duty which is being dangled before the farmer. But if he is to lose\r\n12s. a quarter he will be little farther removed from ruin than if he\r\nloses 17s.; he will as much as ever resemble the traditional refreshment\r\ncontractor who lost a little upon every customer, but thought to make\r\nhis profit by the number he served; and the agricultural interest in its\r\nwildest dreams cannot imagine that Englishmen are likely to impose a\r\nduty raising the price of wheat 60 per cent. A rise of 10 per cent. in\r\nthe price of bread means a rise of 1 per cent. in the death-rate, and if\r\na duty of 17s. were imposed, that rise would be 6 per cent. What would\r\nthis mean? That where 100 persons die now, 106 would die then, and the\r\nadded number would perish from that most awful of all forms of\r\ndeath--death from lack of food. And those extra six would not be drawn\r\nfrom the well-to-do, from the trading classes, or from the ranks of\r\nskilled labour, but from those who even now are struggling their hardest\r\nfor bread, and to whom the rise in price of a loaf from threepence to\r\nfourpence three-farthings would mean starvation. For let it never be\r\nforgotten that it is upon the poorest that a corn-tax would fall most\r\nheavily. The peer eats no more bread--probably he eats less--than the\r\npeasant; even when all his family and servants are reckoned, the\r\nquantity of bread consumed is comparatively little more than in an\r\nartisan's household; but while the peasant and the artisan would be made\r\nto feel with every mouthful that they were being starved in order that\r\nothers might thrive, the few shillings a week that the peer would have\r\nto pay would be but a drop spilt from a full bucket, the loss of which\r\nno one could perceive.\r\n\r\nArising out of the proposal for the re-imposition of a corn-tax is a\r\nconsideration which bears upon the idea of levying a duty upon other\r\nimports. India is rapidly becoming more and more a corn-growing country;\r\nif it were decided to admit its wheat free, the British farmer would\r\ncontinue handicapped; if it were resolved to tax it, India would\r\nnecessarily retaliate by protecting its own cotton industries: and what\r\nwould Lancashire say to that?\r\n\r\nThe fact is that, when the proposal to protect industries all round is\r\nconsidered, the difficulties of securing a feasible plan are found to be\r\ninsurmountable. The simplest way, of course, would be to place a duty\r\nupon everything that entered our ports, and to follow that American\r\ntariff which commenced with a tax upon acorns, and was so jealous of\r\ninterference with native industries that it fixed a duty upon skeletons.\r\nAnd if it be replied that the line should be drawn at manufactured\r\narticles, the question must be asked at once how these are to be\r\ndefined. One can understand shoemakers desiring to place a duty upon\r\nforeign-made boots, but they would object to have the price of leather\r\nincreased by a tax upon the imports of that material. The tanner and\r\ncurrier would strongly favour a tax upon leather, while perfectly\r\nwilling that hides should be admitted free. But the free importation of\r\nhides would affect the farmer, who would have as much right to\r\nprotection as either tanner or bootmaker. And so the price of boots from\r\nthe beginning would be raised to everybody, less boots would be bought,\r\nand the whole community, as well as the particular trades concerned,\r\nwould suffer. Take the woollen industries again. Manufacturers might\r\nlike cloths to be taxed, but would be willing to see yarns admitted\r\nfree. Spinners would place a duty upon yarns, but would let wool alone.\r\nBut the farmer would again step in and demand that the price of his wool\r\nshould not be lowered by free importation. If Protection is started\r\nthere is no stopping it; no line can fairly be drawn between the\r\nimportation of raw material and manufactured articles; every trade will\r\nwant to be taken care of. And we shall be driven back to the time when,\r\nin order to protect the farmer, all bodies had to be buried in woollen\r\nshrouds; and, to protect the buckle maker, the use of shoestrings was by\r\nlaw prohibited. More; we shall be driven back to the period when the\r\nartisan and the labourer saw wheaten bread but once a year, when it was\r\nbarley alone they could afford to eat, and when the rent of the landlord\r\nwas the one consideration for which Parliament cared, and the welfare of\r\nthe poor the last thing of which Parliament dreamed.\r\n\r\nOne can understand why the Protectionist movement should have supporters\r\nin high places. There are landlords who are tired of seeing their rents\r\ncontinuously fall, and are as anxious as ever their fathers were to make\r\nthe community pay the difference between what the land can honestly\r\nyield and the return its possessor desires; and there are manufacturers\r\nwho are disgusted to find that the days when colossal fortunes could be\r\nrapidly made are departing.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty, therefore, of every Liberal to resist the least approach\r\nto a reversal of the present fiscal policy. For it is not a mere\r\nquestion of taxation; it is not even a question only of money; it is a\r\nquestion of life and death to the poor. And every man who knows to what\r\na depth of misery Protection brought this country less than fifty years\r\nsince, and who feels for those who are hardly pressed, will strive to\r\nthe uttermost against any renewal of the system which, while enriching a\r\nfew, impoverishes the many, and, to add bitterness to its injustice,\r\ninvolves death by starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.--IS FOREIGN LABOUR TO BE EXCLUDED?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother of the remedies suggested by political quacks for depression in\r\ntrade is the revival of the system of \"protecting British labour\" by\r\npreventing the immigration of foreigners--a process which, by the good\r\nsense of all Englishmen, has been abolished for centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is easy, of course, to take what at first sight may seem the\r\n\"popular\" side upon this question. There would be no difficulty in\r\nsummoning a meeting of English bakers in London, and telling them that\r\nthey were being ruined because German bakers are overrunning their\r\ntrade; or gathering a small army of clerks, and informing them that but\r\nfor foreign, and particularly German, competition, the native article\r\nwould have a better chance; or assembling a serried array of\r\ncostermongers, and persuading them that, if it were not for Russian,\r\nPolish, and German Jews, who swarm the metropolitan thoroughfares with\r\ntheir handcarts, their own barrows would attract more customers. But the\r\nwhole idea of excluding foreigners because they become competitors is\r\nnot merely a confession of weakness and incapacity which Englishmen\r\nought never to make, but it is so contrary to the spirit of freedom\r\nwhich has been cherished in this country for ages that no Liberal ought\r\nfor a moment to give it countenance.\r\n\r\nAnd, to put it on the most sordid ground, where would England and\r\nEnglish trade have been had such a principle been acted upon by other\r\ncountries? No people in the world has so much benefited by freedom of\r\nmovement in foreign lands as ourselves. Go where one may, he will find\r\nEnglishmen to the fore--not only as traders but as workers. What they\r\nhave done in the colonies and in the United States is patent to all men,\r\nbut it is not alone in Saxon-speaking lands that they have flourished.\r\nIf one visits Italy to-day, he will find Englishmen working in the\r\nGovernment dockyards; when Russia wanted railways it was Brassey and his\r\nnavvies who made them, and when she needed telegraphs it was English\r\nlinesmen who stretched the wires; while in Brazil on every hand\r\nEnglishmen are pushing to the front. And there is a lesson to be learned\r\nfrom that passage in the diary of Macaulay, which records how, on a\r\nvisit to France, he met some English navvies, with the leader of whom he\r\nentered into talk: \"He told me, to my comfort, that they did very well,\r\nbeing, as he said, sober men; that the wages were good, and that they\r\nwere well treated, and had no quarrels with their French\r\nfellow-labourers.\"\r\n\r\nChina for a long series of ages acted upon the principle of keeping out\r\nthe foreigner, and upon various pretexts we fought her again and again\r\nto secure our own admission. Japan was equally exclusive, and for a\r\nlonger time; but even Japan has found out the mistake of trying to live\r\nin \"a garden walled around.\" As far back as the date when Magna Charta\r\nwas signed, the right of foreign merchants to reside and to possess\r\npersonal effects in England was recognized; and although the blindness\r\nand bigotry of succeeding times banished the Jews in one age and the\r\nFlemings in another, we long ago established the right of free entry. It\r\nis true that, in the fit of reaction provoked by the French Terror,\r\nAlien Acts were passed conferring upon the Crown the power of banishing\r\nforeigners, but these were superseded half a hundred years ago, and\r\ntheir revival is not to be looked for.\r\n\r\nIt may be retorted that the United States Congress has taken a different\r\nview, for, in addition to various measures adopted in recent years to\r\nprevent the immigration of Chinamen, an Act was passed in 1885 \"to\r\nprohibit the importation and migration of foreigners and aliens, under\r\ncontract or agreement to perform labour in the United States, its\r\nterritories, and the district of Columbia.\" The effect of that measure,\r\ncoupled with an amending Act adopted two years later, according to\r\nEnglish official authority, is \"to subject to heavy penalties any person\r\nwho prepays the transportation, or in any way assists the importation or\r\nmigration of any alien or foreigner into the said countries under\r\nagreement of any kind whatsoever made previously to such importation, to\r\nperform there labour or service of any description (with a few\r\nexceptions). Masters of vessels knowingly conveying such aliens render\r\nthemselves liable to fine or imprisonment, and the aliens themselves are\r\nnot allowed to land, but are returned to the country whence they came.\"\r\n\r\nThis law, even if it had not been rendered ridiculous by an attempt to\r\nbring ministers of religion within its scope, and even also if it had\r\nnot proved practically a dead letter, does not, however, go far in the\r\ndirection of excluding foreign labour. For men of all nations are as\r\nfree to proceed to the United States to-day as ever they were, the only\r\ncondition being that they shall not, before landing, have made\r\nthemselves secure of finding work. If the same law were applied in\r\nEngland, and even if not a single person evaded (as it would be\r\nremarkably easy to evade) its provisions, it would not affect one in a\r\nhundred of the foreigners who come hither to compete with our own\r\npeople. Does any one imagine that the German bakers and clerks and\r\ncostermongers, who are now so much in evidence, have before landing\r\nentered into a contract of service?\r\n\r\nIf they have not, what further measure could be taken? Ought we to pass\r\na law prohibiting every foreigner from landing? Should we add to it the\r\ncondition that, if he will swear he is a _bona fide_ traveller, he may\r\nbe allowed to remain a few weeks under strict surveillance of the\r\npolice, who will not only watch very carefully that he does no stroke of\r\nwork while in England, but will see to it that he is promptly expelled\r\nwhen his time is up? Are our customs officers to search incoming ships\r\nfor aliens as they do for tobacco, and is the penalty for smuggling\r\nforeigners to be the same as for smuggling snuff? The project of totally\r\nexcluding foreign labour would be as impossible of accomplishment as it\r\nwould be repellent to attempt.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" some will answer, \"is it right that we should be deluged with\r\nforeign paupers, who come upon our rates without paying a penny towards\r\nthem?\" That is quite another matter, and does not affect the question of\r\nforeign labour in any but an indirect way. It certainly is not right\r\nthat we should be burdened by foreign paupers; and England would be\r\nacting in perfect consistence with the principles of liberty and justice\r\nif she did as the United States and the Continental countries have done,\r\nin prohibiting the landing of paupers, and insisting upon sending them\r\nback to the place whence they came. This is a matter of municipal rather\r\nthan international law; and a repetition of such a scandal as that of\r\nthe Greek gipsies, who were excluded from various European ports, and\r\nwere yet suffered to land here and to become a nuisance and a burden,\r\nought not to be allowed.\r\n\r\nWhat is being argued against is not the enactment of a law to exclude\r\nforeign paupers, but of one to exclude foreign workers. But even if the\r\nformer were to be proposed, it would have to be narrowly watched, lest\r\nit should be so drafted as to deprive England by a sidewind of the title\r\nof an asylum for the oppressed which she has so long and proudly worn.\r\nFor it is at the right of asylum that some of the advocates of exclusion\r\nwish to strike. In the United States there is being formed a party to\r\nstrengthen the \"Contract to Labour\" Law, which avowedly wishes \"to stop\r\nthe import of lawless elements\"--an elastic phrase which might cover any\r\nbody of persons who wished for reform. And in England, Mr. Vincent, the\r\nproposer of the Protectionist resolution adopted by the Tory conference\r\nat Oxford in 1887, stated that \"the indiscriminate asylum afforded here\r\nhas long been regarded by continental Governments as an outrage on good\r\norder and civilization.\" He may rely upon it, however, that the English\r\nlove for the right of asylum is not to be destroyed by the wish or the\r\nopinion of any despotic Government on earth, and that a right which\r\nshook down the strong Administration of Lord Palmerston, when in an evil\r\nhour he menaced it at the bidding of Louis Napoleon 30 years since, will\r\nwithstand the threatenings even of a conclave of chosen Conservatives.\r\n\r\nMany things are possible to a Tory Government, and it may be that, in\r\nthe endeavour to secure some puff of a popular breeze to fill its\r\nsails, it will pander to the section which demands the exclusion of\r\nforeigners. But how could such a measure be proposed by a Ministry which\r\nhas among its members the Duke of Portland, whose family name, Bentinck,\r\nproclaims his Dutch descent; Mr. Goschen and Baron Henry de Worms, whose\r\nnames no less emphatically announce them to have sprung from German\r\nJews; and Mr. Bartlett, who, though he tells the world by means of\r\nreference-books that he was born at Plymouth, forgets to add that this\r\nis not the town in England but one in the United States?\r\n\r\nBut it is not to be believed that England will in this matter forget her\r\ntraditions. We, who are descended from Briton and Saxon, from Norman and\r\nDane, have had reason to be proud of our faculty of absorbing all the\r\nforeign elements that have reached these shores, and turning them to\r\ngood account. When our Puritan fathers were hunted down in England, it\r\nwas in a foreign clime they made their home; when other Englishmen have\r\nlacked employment, it is to foreign lands they have gone; and the\r\nhospitality extended to them by the foreigner we have returned. Go into\r\nCanterbury Cathedral to-day, and there see the chapel set apart for the\r\nFrench refugees, driven from their country for conscience' sake;\r\nremember how, after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the unhappy\r\nHuguenots fled to England to do good service to their adopted country by\r\nestablishing here the manufacture of silk. Never forget how advantageous\r\nit has been for Englishmen to have the whole world open to their\r\nendeavours; and hesitate long before attempting to deny to others that\r\nright of free movement in labour which has been and is of such immense\r\nadvantage to ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--HOW SHOULD WE GUIDE OUR FOREIGN POLICY?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a natural process of thought, the consideration of the proposed\r\nexclusion of foreign labour leads to that of foreign policy generally;\r\nand although the vast questions involved in our external relations are\r\nnot to be solved in a few lines, an attempt to lay down some general\r\nprinciples upon the matter can hardly be wasted, for of all things\r\nconnected with public affairs, foreign policy is that of which the\r\naverage voter knows the least, and for which he pays the most. The\r\nyearly twenty-seven millions as interest on the National Debt is a\r\nperpetual legacy from the foreign policy of the past; while an equally\r\nturbulent one in the present would increase the already heavy\r\nexpenditure on the navy and army to an alarming extent. But as all\r\nquestions covered by the phrase cannot be put in the simple form \"Shall\r\nwe go to war?\" there is a necessity for the leading principles which\r\nshould govern them to be considered.\r\n\r\nA good guide to the future is experience of the past, and our English\r\nhistory will have taught us little if it has not shown that many a war\r\nhas been waged which patience and wisdom might have avoided. And\r\nalthough we have never avowedly gone to war \"for an idea,\" as Louis\r\nNapoleon said that France did concerning the expedition in which he\r\nstole two Italian provinces, it has been because of the devotion of our\r\nstatesmen to certain pet theories that much shedding of blood is due.\r\n\r\nOne of these theories is that some nation or other is \"our natural\r\nenemy.\" France for several centuries held that position, and it was as\r\nobvious to one generation that the word \"Frenchman\" was synonymous with\r\n\"fiend\" as it was for another to link \"Spaniard\" with \"devil\" and for a\r\nnearer still to consider that the Emperor Nicholas of Russia and \"Old\r\nNick\" were one and the same. Just now the \"natural enemy\" idea is\r\nhappily dormant, if not dead; but its evil effect upon our foreign\r\npolicy has been all too plainly marked in many a page of history.\r\n\r\nAnother theory, and one which has had a more far-reaching extent, is\r\nthat it is incumbent upon the nations of Europe to maintain \"the balance\r\nof power.\" This, again, is a phrase which has lost much of its old\r\nforce; but a Continental struggle might cause it to bloom once more with\r\nall its baleful effects. Speaking about a quarter of a century ago, Mr.\r\nBright, considering the theory to be \"pretty nearly dead and buried,\"\r\nobserved of it to his constituents: \"You cannot comprehend at a thought\r\nwhat is meant by that balance of power. If the record could be brought\r\nbefore you--but it is not possible to the eye of humanity to scan the\r\nscroll upon which are recorded the sufferings which the theory of the\r\nbalance of power has entailed upon this country. It rises up before me,\r\nwhen I think of it, as a ghastly phantom which during 170 years, whilst\r\nit has been worshipped in this country, has loaded the nation with debt\r\nand with taxes, has sacrificed the lives of hundreds of thousands of\r\nEnglishmen, has desolated the homes of millions of families, and has\r\nleft us, as the great result of the profligate expenditure which it has\r\ncaused, a doubled peerage at one end of the social scale and far more\r\nthan a doubled pauperism at the other. I am very glad to be here\r\nto-night, amongst other things, to be able to say that we may rejoice\r\nthat this foul idol--fouler than any heathen tribe ever worshipped--has\r\nat last been thrown down, and that there is one superstition less which\r\nhas its hold upon the minds of English statesmen and of the English\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nThe theory which was thus unsparingly denounced held that we, as a\r\nnation, have a right to interfere to prevent any other nation from\r\nbecoming stronger than it now is, lest its increased strength should\r\nthreaten our interests. Politicians of the old school were accustomed to\r\nassure us that, although the name might not have been known to the\r\nancients, the idea was; and, with that almost superstitious regard which\r\nused to be paid to Greek and Roman precedents, Hume, in one of his\r\n\"Essays,\" related that \"in all the politics of Greece, the anxiety with\r\nregard to the balance of power is apparent, and is expressly pointed out\r\nto us even by the ancient historians;\" he was of opinion that \"whoever\r\nwill read Demosthenes' oration for the Megalopolitans may see the utmost\r\nrefinements on this principle that ever entered into the head of a\r\nVenetian or English speculatist;\" and, having quoted a passage from\r\nPolybius in support of the theory, he observed: \"There is the aim of\r\nmodern politics pointed out in express terms.\"\r\n\r\nBut \"the aim of modern politics\" has been changed within the past\r\ncentury. Since the era which closed with Waterloo in 1815, England,\r\nAustria, Russia, France, and Germany have held in turn the dominant\r\npower in the councils of Europe, and the balance has been so frequently\r\ndisturbed that the mapmakers have scarcely been able to keep pace with\r\nthe changes of the frontiers. Look back only thirty years, and see what\r\nhas occurred. Instead of Italy being \"a fortuitous concourse of atoms,\"\r\nor merely \"a geographical expression,\" she is the sixth great Power, the\r\nkingdom of Sardinia, the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Papal States,\r\nthe grand duchies of Lucca, Parma, Tuscany, Modena, and the rest, with\r\nVenetia (in 1858 an Austrian possession) thrown in, having been combined\r\nto form that old dream of Mazzini, Garibaldi, and their\r\nfellow-revolutionaries, \"United Italy, with Rome for its capital.\" In\r\nthe place of a congeries of petty kingdoms and states, always jarring,\r\nand with Austria and Prussia ever struggling for the mastery, we see a\r\nGerman Empire, formed by the kingdom of Hanover being swept out of\r\nexistence, and those of Bavaria, Saxony, and Wurtemburg, with various\r\ngrand duchies, placed under the domination of Prussia. In the same\r\nperiod Russia has gained and France has lost territory; the Ottoman\r\nEmpire has been \"consolidated\" into feebleness; and the kingdoms of\r\nRoumania and Servia, with the principality of Bulgaria, have been called\r\nin their present shape into being. All this has seriously disturbed the\r\n\"balance of power;\" but what could England have done to hinder the\r\nprocess if she had wished, and what right would she have had to attempt\r\nit if she had dared?\r\n\r\nAnd in addition to the disturbance of the \"balance of power\" by process\r\nof war and revolution, there is that which comes from physical,\r\neducational, industrial, and moral causes. Some nations have a greater\r\nfaculty than others of securing success in the markets of the world, and\r\nthese develop their natural resources in such fashion as to outstrip\r\ntheir neighbours. If we ought to be continually fighting to prevent\r\nother countries from aggrandizing themselves in point of territory, we\r\nought equally to do so to hinder them from becoming disproportionately\r\npowerful in point of wealth. But as there is no man among us so insane\r\nas to suggest the latter, so, it may be hoped, will there soon be none\r\nto instigate the former. It is now over twenty years since even a Tory\r\nAdministration felt constrained to omit from the preamble of the Mutiny\r\nBill some words relating to the preservation of the \"balance of power\";\r\nand if anything had been needed to cast undying ridicule upon the theory\r\nit was the plea of King Milan that he went to war with Prince Alexander\r\nin 1885, because the union of Bulgaria with Eastern Roumelia had\r\ndisturbed the \"balance of power\" in the Balkan States.\r\n\r\nAnother idea upon which it is often sought to provoke war is \"regard for\r\nthe sanctity of treaties.\" There is an honest sound about this which has\r\ncaused it to deceive many worthy folk, but who in his heart believes\r\nthat there is any \"sanctity\" about treaties? Nations, as a fact, abide\r\nby treaties just as long as it suits their purpose, and not a day\r\nlonger. Take the Treaty of Vienna, which after 1815 was to settle the\r\naffairs of Europe for ever. The disruption of Belgium from Holland was\r\nthe first great blow at its provisions, and one after another of these\r\nsubsequently became a dead letter. The Treaty of Paris, concluded after\r\nthe Crimean War, Russia deliberately set aside in a most important part\r\nas soon as she conveniently could. The Treaty of Frankfort, between\r\nGermany and France, will last only as long as the French do not feel\r\nthemselves equal to the task of wresting back Alsace-Lorraine. And the\r\nTreaty of Berlin, the latest great European compact of all, entered into\r\nafter the Russo-Turkish War, has already been violated in various\r\ndirections, and is daily threatened with being violated in more. A\r\ntreaty, in fact, is not like an agreement between equal parties, in\r\nwhich one gives something to the other for value received; it is\r\ncustomarily a bargain hardly driven by a conqueror as regards the\r\nconquered, and one from which the latter intends to free himself as soon\r\nas he has the chance. And so, whenever any one talks about the \"sanctity\r\nof treaties,\" let us first see what the treaties are, and under what\r\ncircumstances they were obtained. It will then be sufficient time to\r\nconsider the amount of reverence which is their due.\r\n\r\nBut there is a further theory upon which war is made, and that is the\r\nmost sordid of all, for, discarding all notions of honour and glory, it\r\nsimply avers that we ought to physically fight for commercial\r\nadvancement. A recent writer who seeks to tell us all about \"Our\r\nColonies and India; how we got them, and why we keep them,\" devotes his\r\nfirst chapter to attempting to prove that nothing but desire for gain\r\nactuated our forefathers in every one of their great wars, or, to use\r\nhis own illustration, \"we were afraid that our estate was going to be\r\nbroken up; we had a large family; and we spent money and borrowed money\r\nto keep the property together, and to extend it. From our point of view,\r\nas a nation, we have to set one side of our account against the other\r\nand see whether our transaction paid. It is,\" he adds, \"very often said\r\nthat England has very little to show for her National Debt. Nothing to\r\nshow for the National Debt! It is the price we pay for the largest\r\nColonial Empire the world has ever seen.\" This is probably the most\r\nnaked exposition of the worst side of the saying that \"Trade follows the\r\nflag\" which has in late years been published; but that the idea which\r\nunderlies it still actuates a certain school of statesmen is shown by\r\nthe fact that Lord Randolph Churchill justified the expedition to Upper\r\nBurmah--as long, tedious, and destructive a business as it was promised\r\nto be short, easy, and dangerless--on the ground that the new territory\r\nwould \"pay.\"\r\n\r\nNow here are certain principles which have guided the foreign policy of\r\nthe past, and which stand as beacons to warn us against dangers in the\r\nfuture. That we shall escape war for all time to come is not to be hoped\r\nfor, but, by considering the crimes and blunders and bloodshed which\r\nhave flowed from previous methods, something may be done to avoid it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.--IS A PEACE POLICY PRACTICABLE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question whether a settled adherence to the principles of\r\nnon-intervention is compatible at once with our interests and our honour\r\nis one upon which much of the future of England may depend. The answer\r\nis not to be found in sneers at a \"peace-at-any-price policy,\" which has\r\nnever been adopted by any section of our countrymen, or in panegyrics\r\nupon the virtues evolved by war, made by men who sit comfortably in\r\ntheir arm-chairs while they hound others on to bloodshed. It is a\r\nquestion which of necessity can only be answered in certain cases as the\r\ncircumstances arise, but there is nothing either cowardly or\r\ndishonourable in considering the general principles involved in a reply.\r\n\r\nLooking at the world as it stands, it seems almost beyond hope that war\r\nwill ever cease. It is true that we have got rid of blood-letting in\r\nsurgery and that we have got rid of blood-letting in society, and it\r\nmay, therefore, seem to some that there is a chance of getting rid of\r\nblood-letting between States. A century since, the doctor's lancet and\r\nthe duellist's pistol were rivals in slaughter, and all but fanatics\r\nthought their abolition impossible. What will be said of war in the time\r\nto come?\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of it then, we know what can be said of it now. It\r\nis a grievous curse to the nations engaged, and a calamitous hindrance\r\nto civilization. It is a barbarous and illogical method of settling\r\ninternational disputes, which decides only that one side is the\r\nstronger, and never shows which side is the right. The cynical saying\r\nthat God is on the side of the big battalions is true at bottom. We\r\nlaugh to-day at the old custom of \"Trial by battle,\" recognizing that\r\nthe innocent combatant was often the weaker or less skilful, and that\r\nthe guilty consequently triumphed. But \"Trial by battle,\" as between\r\nnations, is equally absurd, if any one imagines that it shows which is\r\nthe righteous. Who would contend that France was in the right when\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte, in his early career, by his superior skill in\r\ntactics, swept the nations of Europe before him at Arcola and Marengo,\r\nAusterlitz and Jena, and that he was in the wrong when, in the waning of\r\nhis powers, he was irretrievably ruined at Waterloo? That Denmark was in\r\nthe wrong because the combined forces of Austria and Prussia crushed her\r\nin the struggle over Schleswig-Holstein, and that Prussia was in the\r\nright when, after she and her neighbour had quarrelled like a couple of\r\nthieves over their booty, she placed the needle-gun against the\r\nmuzzle-loader and overwhelmed Austria? The spirit which impels each\r\ncombatant to call upon the Almighty as of right for assistance, and\r\nwhich leads the victor to sing a _Te Deum_ at the struggle's close, is a\r\nblasphemous one, which should not blind us to the criminality of most\r\nwars. To hurl thousands of men into conflict in order to extend trade or\r\nacquire territory is an iniquity, disguise it by what phrases we will.\r\nIn private life the man who steals is called a thief, the man who kills\r\nis called a murderer; why in public life should the nation which steals,\r\nand which kills in order to steal, be differently treated? If there be\r\nretributive justice beyond the grave, Frederick the Great and Napoleon\r\nBonaparte, who in cold blood and for selfish motives sacrificed tens of\r\nthousands of lives, will stand at the murderers' bar side by side with\r\nthose lesser criminals who have gone to the gallows for a single\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\nLet us look at war, therefore, as it is--a direful necessity, even when\r\njustified by self-preservation, a flagrant crime when entered upon for\r\nthe extension of territory or trade. It is easy to raise the cry of\r\npatriotism whenever a war is undertaken, but the patriotism that pays\r\nothers to fight is a cheap article which deserves no praise. As for the\r\nbloodthirsty bray of the music halls, which even English statesmen have\r\nnot disdained to stimulate in favour of their policy, it is abhorrent to\r\ncleanly-minded men; the ethics of the taproom and the patriotism of the\r\npewter-pot are not to their taste; and when it is seen that the most\r\nsanguinary writers and the most blatant talkers are the last to put\r\ntheir own bodies in peril, it cannot but be concluded that their theory\r\nis that patriotism is a virtue to be preached by themselves and\r\npractised by their neighbours.\r\n\r\nBut though a reckless or merely aggressive war is not only the greatest\r\nof human ills but the gravest of national crimes, an armed struggle is\r\nin certain instances a necessity. Self-preservation is the first law of\r\nnature; and as no man would condemn another for slaying, if no milder\r\nmeasure would do, one who attempted to kill him, and the law would\r\nregard such a course as justifiable homicide, so a nation is right to\r\nfight against invasion, and would deserve to be extinguished or enslaved\r\nif it did not. \"Defence, not defiance,\" the motto of our volunteers,\r\nshould be the motto of our statesmen; and then, if an enemy attacked us,\r\nwe should be able to give a good account of ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn order to act up to this motto, we must dabble as little as possible\r\nwith affairs that do not directly concern us. We should cease to think\r\nthat we are the arbiters of the world's quarrels--we have enough to do\r\nto look after our colonies and ourselves--and we should withdraw from\r\nsuch entangling engagements as we have, and enter upon no fresh ones.\r\nWhen, for instance, we are urged to formally join the Triple Alliance,\r\nwe must ask why we should bind ourselves to fight France and Russia\r\nbecause Germany would like to pay off old scores, Austria wishes to get\r\nto Salonica, and Italy is eager to assert her position as the\r\nlatest-created \"Great Power.\" As it is, a Continental struggle, such as\r\nis bound to come in the near future, may sufficiently involve us. No one\r\nseems quite to know whether we are or are not bound by treaty to defend\r\nthe territorial independence of Belgium; but as it is through \"the\r\ncockpit of Europe\" that Germany may next attempt to assail France, or\r\nFrance try to reach Germany, the question is a very important one.\r\nWould it not be better to settle that before we proceed to bind\r\nourselves with the chains of an alliance which could do us little good,\r\nbut might easily effect considerable harm?\r\n\r\nNon-intervention has again and again been proved to be an honourable and\r\nbeneficent policy. There has been scarcely a great war within the last\r\nthirty years in which we have not been urged by some section in this\r\ncountry to interfere. The Franco-Austrian conflict in 1859, the civil\r\nwar in America, the Austro-Prussian attack upon Denmark, the\r\nFranco-German war, and the Russo-Turkish struggle--in every one of these\r\nwe were urged to interfere on behalf of our interests or our honour, or\r\nboth. In none did we do so, and who to-day will argue that abstention\r\nwas wrong? There are some politicians who appear wishful to see\r\nEngland's finger in every international pie, and the same old arguments,\r\nthe same vehement appeals, are used whenever there is a struggle abroad.\r\nAnd when the next occurs, and these weather-beaten arguments and appeals\r\nare again brought to the fore, let those who may be swayed by them turn\r\nto the files of the newspapers which instigated intervention in all of\r\nthe cases named; and let them reflect that non-intervention proved the\r\nbest course in every one, and that what did so well before is most\r\nlikely to do well again.\r\n\r\nBut, even if we sedulously pursue this policy, there are occasions when\r\ndifferences arise with other States, and the question is how these can\r\nbe composed. In the large majority of cases the remedy will be found in\r\narbitration. Here, again, we shall be confronted with assertions about\r\nhonour and patriotism, which experience has proved to be worthless. Two\r\nstriking instances have been afforded of the value of international\r\narbitration. The greater is that which solved the difficulty between\r\nourselves and the United States concerning the Alabama claims. Here was\r\na matter in which England was distinctly in the wrong, and, as long as\r\nthe sore remained open, so long was there danger of war ensuing between\r\nthe two great English-speaking nations of the earth. When Mr.\r\nGladstone's first Government resolved to submit it to arbitration, no\r\nlanguage was too vehement for some of our Tories to apply to the\r\nprocess. It was dishonourable, unpatriotic, and pusillanimous; but Mr.\r\nGladstone persevered, and with what result? The dispute was settled, the\r\nsore was healed; and is there a solitary man among us who will contend\r\nthat the better plan would have been to send into their graves thousands\r\nof unoffending men, and to perpetuate, perhaps for generations, a\r\nquarrel which has been so happily decided as now to have almost faded\r\nout of mind? The other instance is afforded by the resolve, in the\r\nspring of 1885, to refer the dispute with Russia concerning the Penjdeh\r\nconflict to arbitration. There were threatenings of slaughter on every\r\nhand, for weeks there appeared a danger of our being launched into war\r\nfor a strip of Afghan territory, worthless alike to Russians, Afghans,\r\nand ourselves, and upon a conflict of testimony as to the original\r\naggression, which even yet has not been composed. The agreement to\r\nsubmit the matter to the King of Denmark, though his arbitrament\r\nultimately was dispensed with, gave a breathing time to Russia and\r\nEngland both; and who now would argue that we ought to have gone to war\r\nbecause of Penjdeh?\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we adhere to a policy of non-intervention in disputes that\r\ndo not directly concern us, and of arbitration in those in which we\r\nbecome involved, we shall be following a course which the immediate past\r\nhas proved to be not only peaceful but honourable and agreeable to our\r\ninterests. \"The greatest of British interests is peace,\" once observed\r\nthe present Lord Derby; and the truth of the saying is unimpeachable.\r\nAnd when we are told that, strive as we will, war sometimes must come,\r\none is reminded of the saying of a far greater statesman than Lord\r\nDerby, and one upon whose patriotism none has been able to cast a slur.\r\nIt was Canning who, when told that a war in certain circumstances was\r\nbound to come sooner or later, replied, \"Then let it be later.\"\r\n\r\nIf, however, we wish England to pursue a peaceful policy, we must teach\r\nthe people to believe that it is as honourable as it is practicable, and\r\nas truly patriotic as both. It is a mistake to think that the masses\r\nwill oppose war merely because of the suffering and loss it entails;\r\nthere are considerations beyond these which the artisan feels as keenly\r\nas the aristocrat, the peasant as the peer. The sentiment which resents,\r\neven to blood-shedding, an insult to the national flag, may be often to\r\nbe deprecated but never to be despised; for when the people shall care\r\nnothing for the country's honour, the days of independent national\r\nexistence will be drawing to a close. And, therefore, when it is argued\r\nthat a peace policy is practicable, it is held to be so only because it\r\nis honourable, patriotic, and just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.--HOW SHOULD WE DEAL WITH THE COLONIES?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foreign relations of England are necessarily complicated by her\r\ncolonial concerns; and these deserve the most careful consideration,\r\nbecause at any moment they may arouse the hottest political dispute of\r\nthe day. In considering the colonies we have to ask three questions: (1)\r\nHow and why did we get them; (2) How and why do we keep them; and (3)\r\nOught we to force them to stay?\r\n\r\nAt the history of the why and how we acquired our colonies, it is\r\nimpossible here to do more than glance. By settlement as in the case of\r\nAustralasia, by conquest as in that of Canada, and by treaty cession as\r\nin that of the Cape, have been obtained within the past three centuries\r\npractically all that we have. The wish for expansion has continually\r\nmade itself felt, and the frequent result of war as well as of peaceful\r\ndiscovery has been to gratify it. And the consequence of both conquest\r\nand discovery has been the acquisition of a colonial empire vaster in\r\nextent and resources than the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nHaving got our colonies, there are various reasons for retaining them.\r\nThe imperial spirit, which is elated by expansion and would be deeply\r\nwounded by contraction, has been a prominent factor in causing England\r\nto take a leading position in the world's affairs; and it is one which\r\nnone interested in her prosperity will despise. Even if there were no\r\nmaterial reasons for keeping our colonies, this sentiment would cause\r\nmany Englishmen, and probably the majority, to regard with the deepest\r\ndistrust any movement having a tendency to separate the colonies from\r\nthe mother country.\r\n\r\nBut there are material reasons for binding the colonies to us which\r\nnone will ignore. They form not only an outlet for our surplus labour\r\nand enterprise, but give us markets of high importance to our trade.\r\nEmigrants who go to Canada or Australia not merely remain attached by\r\nobvious considerations to the English connection, but continue to be our\r\ncustomers in a very much larger degree than if they went to the United\r\nStates or any other foreign country. Those who study the statistics of\r\nour export trade will recognize that if we lost the custom of our\r\ncolonies--and this we should be likely to do if we lost the colonies\r\nthemselves--the consequences to our commerce would be very serious.\r\n\r\nThus there are reasons of the highest sentiment, as well as of\r\ncommercial expediency, for retaining the possessions the hard fighting\r\nand determined enterprise of many generations of Englishmen have\r\nacquired; but the question which is needed to be answered in much more\r\nfulness than either of the others is that which may affect the politics\r\nof the near future: Ought we, if any of our self-governing colonies\r\ndesire to secede, to force them to stay?\r\n\r\nA distinct difference has been made in the form of this question between\r\nthe self-governing colonies and the dependencies--a distinction arising\r\nfrom the very nature of things. There is a chasm between the\r\nconsideration of letting Australia or letting India go, which is too\r\nwide to be bridged. Australia consists of various colonies, peopled by\r\nEnglishmen or the descendants of Englishmen, who have the fullest means\r\nof constitutionally expressing their desires. India has a vast concourse\r\nof deeply-divided peoples, who have no bond of union, whether of race,\r\nreligion, or common descent, and who are in no sense self-governed. In\r\nthe argument about to be set forward, therefore, it is to be understood\r\nthat only the colonies, and not the dependencies, are in consideration.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, it may be submitted with regard to our self-governing\r\ncolonies that we are bound in honour to keep them as long as they will\r\nstay, and in conscience not to detain them when they are able and\r\nwilling to go. Having acquired them, and given the most practical\r\nguarantees to protect them, we ought to hold to our implied bargain at\r\nany cost, and to defend them with as much energy as our native soil.\r\nBut, just as a parent's duty to a child is to do everything to protect\r\nand assist him in his period of growth, so is it equally his duty, when\r\nthe training-time has been accomplished, to set no hindrance in the path\r\nof his acquiring an independent position. And the relation of parent to\r\nchild has a true likeness to that of England to her self-governing\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked whether this question of what should be done in case of a\r\nproposed separation ought to be raised at the present moment, the reply\r\nis that events are forcing the matter forward, and that it is well to\r\nconsider in a time of comparative quiet a problem which may convulse the\r\nnation from end to end if urged upon us in a storm.\r\n\r\nFor rumblings of the storm have already been heard from the three great\r\nself-governing portions of our colonial empire. Sir Henry Parkes, the\r\nPremier of New South Wales, in an article published no long time since,\r\nand in the very act of proposing a scheme by which he imagined the\r\nmother country and the colonies might be knit more closely together,\r\nuttered a warning that separation might within the next generation be\r\npushed to the front, for \"there are persons in Australia, and in most of\r\nthe Australian Legislatures, who avowedly or tacitly favour the idea.\"\r\nAnd he added: \"In regard to the large mass of the English people in\r\nAustralia, there can be no doubt of their genuine loyalty to the present\r\nState, and their affectionate admiration for the present illustrious\r\noccupant of the throne. But this loyalty is nourished at a great\r\ndistance, and by tens of thousands, daily increasing, who have never\r\nknown any land but the one dear land where they dwell. It is the growth\r\nof a semitropical soil, alike tender and luxuriant, and a slight thing\r\nmay bruise, even snap asunder, its young tendrils.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from Australia to Canada, the same warning is in the air.\r\nIn the autumn of 1887, the remarks of Mr. Chamberlain at Belfast,\r\nrepudiating the principle of commercial union between Canada and the\r\nUnited States, evoked strong protests from some leading newspapers in\r\nthe Dominion against the idea of England interfering if such a union\r\nwere agreed upon. The Toronto _Mail_ put the matter in a nutshell when\r\nit observed--\"Let there be no misunderstanding on this point. Canadians\r\nhave not ceased to love and venerate England, but have simply reached\r\nthat stage of development when their choice of what is best for\r\nthemselves, be it what it may, must prevail over all other\r\nconsiderations.\" Should it be said that this is only an utterance of our\r\nold friend \"the irresponsible journalist,\" it may be added that the\r\npractice of Canadian statesmen appears to be in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of Canadian writers. This was certainly the opinion of our\r\nown _Standard_, which, in an article in 1887 upon the increases in the\r\nCanadian tariff directed against imported iron and steel, wrote--\"The\r\nobvious truth of the matter is that Canada has given no thought to our\r\ninterests at all, but only to her own.... Of course these Canadians are\r\na most 'loyal' people for all that, and if they can get us to lend them\r\nour money they will flatter us and heap sweet-sounding phrases upon us,\r\ntill the most voracious appetite for such is cloyed to sickness. It is\r\nonly when we expect them to pay us our money back, or at least to put up\r\nno barriers against our trade with them, that we find out how hollow\r\nthese phrases are. No federation of the empire can take place under any\r\nguise while its leading colonies, which love us so exceedingly, strive\r\ntheir utmost to injure our trade.... Why should we waste a drop of our\r\nblood or spend a shilling of our means to shelter countries whose\r\nselfishness is so great that they never give a thought to any interest\r\nof ours? That is the question the Protectionist colonies are forcing\r\nEnglishmen to ask themselves, and it is as well that it should be\r\nbluntly put to them now.\"\r\n\r\nCape Colony is as ready as Australia or Canada to resent the least\r\ninterference from the mother country. Sir Gordon Sprigg, its Premier,\r\nreferring at a public meeting late in 1887 to a Bill which the Imperial\r\nMinistry had been asked to disallow, observed that, if it should be\r\ndisallowed, it was not a question of this particular Bill, but whether\r\nthe colony was to have a free government, or whether necessary\r\nlegislation in South Africa was to be checked by irresponsible persons\r\nat home, and they were to go back to the old Constitution, and be\r\ngoverned by a people six thousand miles away, knowing little of the\r\nrequirements of the inhabitants of the Cape.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have to face a growing opinion among the self-governing\r\ncolonies that they will allow England no controlling voice in their\r\ninternal affairs; and the question will present itself to many\r\nEnglishmen whether it is right that we should be saddled with the\r\nresponsibility of defending colonies which resent any interference, and\r\nuse their tariffs to lessen our trade. As long as they require help we\r\nare bound in honour to give it; but when they demand, as at some time\r\nthey will demand, separation, the conviction they are now impressing\r\nupon us that they can do without England, will materially strengthen the\r\ndesire to say to them, \"Go in peace.\"\r\n\r\nEven if such a consideration did not exist, one might hope that England\r\nwould never repeat the enterprise once attempted against what are now\r\nthe United States, and try to crush a growing nation of our own children\r\nwhen wishing to take its own place in the economy of the world. Some\r\nwill answer that all danger of such a contingency would be avoided by\r\nthe adoption of a sound plan of imperial federation; but where is that\r\nsound plan to be looked for? Even the most ardent advocates of the\r\nprinciple do not venture upon a plan. They are content to talk of\r\nsympathy rather than develop a system; but sympathy does not go far when\r\npractical considerations are concerned. It may be argued that sympathy\r\nwent a long way when a detachment from New South Wales assisted our\r\nmilitary operations in the Soudan; but the experiment was a dangerous\r\none which ought not to be often repeated. Franklin in his autobiography\r\ntells us that it was the defeat of Braddock's force which first taught\r\nthe American colonists that it was possible to hope for independence;\r\nand the lesson needs remembering.\r\n\r\nWhat those who advocate imperial federation have to prove is that it is\r\npracticable to persuade each portion of this vast empire to pay and to\r\nfight for every other portion. As long as England does both the paying\r\nand the fighting, things may go smoothly. But if England went to war\r\nwith France over the New Hebrides, in order to protect the interests of\r\nAustralia, what would Newfoundland say on being asked to share the\r\nbill? Similarly, if England engaged France over the bait question, so as\r\nto preserve the fishing trade of Newfoundland, how would Australia like\r\nto be taxed for the fray? And if we fought the United States on the\r\nfisheries dispute in order to please Canada, does any one imagine that\r\nAustralia or Cape Colony would agree to additional imposts for the\r\nlessening of our National Debt? It is when considerations like these are\r\ndiscussed that imperial federation appears a pleasing dream rather than\r\na probable reality.\r\n\r\nAnd, therefore, when we discuss our future dealings with the colonies,\r\nwe ought to know how far we intend to go. As long as they remain with\r\nus, we ought to do our utmost to preserve the most friendly relations;\r\nbut, having given them self-government, we ought to impress upon them\r\nthe necessity for self-preservation. And if, when they can not only rule\r\nbut protect themselves, they should ask to be freed from even the\r\nnominal allegiance to the English Crown which is all they now give, they\r\nshould be suffered to go, in the hope and belief that they would\r\nprosper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.--SHOULD THE STATE SOLVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS?\r\n\r\n\r\nThough we have been discussing at this length our foreign and colonial\r\nrelations, we must never forget that there is a \"condition of England\r\nquestion\" which claims the closest attention. The politics of the future\r\nwill be largely coloured by considerations arising from our social\r\ndevelopments; and it is important to decide whether the State ought to\r\nattempt to solve social problems, and how far it ought to interfere in\r\nthe relations between man and man.\r\n\r\nThere is just now so much talk about Socialism that it is desirable to\r\nexamine the principles which underlie State-interference with private\r\naffairs. Those who like to divide men into strictly defined parties are\r\naccustomed to describe their fellows as Socialists and Individualists;\r\nand, although there is no Socialist who would prevent all liberty of\r\npersonal action, and no Individualist who would protest against every\r\nform of State-interference, the distinction is fair enough if it be\r\nunderstood that the Socialist believes that the State should do as much\r\nas possible, and the Individualist that it should do as little as\r\npossible, for those who dwell within its limits.\r\n\r\nThe view of the former is concisely stated in the programme of the\r\nSocial Democratic Federation, in which are urged the immediate\r\ncompulsory construction of healthy artisans' and agricultural labourers'\r\ndwellings, free compulsory education for all classes, with at least one\r\nwholesome meal a day in each school, an eight hours' working day,\r\ncumulative taxation upon all incomes above a fixed minimum, State\r\nappropriation of railways with or without compensation, the\r\nestablishment of national banks absorbing all others, rapid extinction\r\nof the National Debt, nationalization of the land, and organization of\r\nagricultural and industrial armies under State control on co-operative\r\nprinciples. These are merely claimed to be palliative measures, which\r\nshould be followed by others more drastic; but they suffice to show the\r\npresent-day Socialistic idea.\r\n\r\nAgainst this extreme Socialist view must be set the extreme\r\nIndividualist, which has been expressed by Mr. Spencer, who says--\"There\r\nis reason to believe that the ultimate political condition must be one\r\nin which personal freedom is the greatest possible, and governmental\r\npower the least possible; that, namely, in which the freedom of each has\r\nno limit but the like freedom of all; while the sole governmental duty\r\nis the maintenance of this limit.\" And the main idea of this statement\r\nhad been anticipated in the remark, a couple of thousand years ago, by\r\none of the greatest of Greek philosophers--\"The truth is that the State\r\nin which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is the best and most\r\nquietly governed, and the State in which they are most willing is the\r\nworst.\"\r\n\r\nThe real question, of course, is not between any such extreme views, for\r\nMr. Spencer would not deny that the State sometimes must interfere, and\r\nMr. George would be the last to plead against the use of all individual\r\neffort. But though the limits of State-interference are what we have to\r\ndetermine, it is necessary first to consider whether the State should\r\ninterfere at all.\r\n\r\nAn obvious answer is that the State interferes already in many a social\r\nproblem, and that no one seriously proposes to do away with that\r\ninterference. But even those who would thus reply may not be aware of\r\nthe extent to which the State makes its influence felt in social\r\naffairs. The administration of justice and the protection of the\r\ncommonwealth are necessarily, in all civilized communities, the affair\r\nof the State. But beyond these limits, the ruling authority, whether\r\nexercised through imperial or local officials, wanders at many a point.\r\n\r\nThe Poor-law is a striking instance of this fact, for it is a piece of\r\nlegislation the Socialistic tendency of which none can gainsay, the\r\nState practically asserting that no one need starve, and providing food\r\nand shelter, under certain conditions, for all who are unable, or even\r\nunwilling, to work. The system of national education is another instance\r\nof Socialistic legislation; it makes me pay towards the education of my\r\nneighbour's child, not for any immediate benefit to myself, but for my\r\nultimate benefit as a citizen of an improved State. And the ruling\r\nauthority goes further even than compelling me to feed the poor and\r\neducate the young, for it interferes, presumably for my good, with my\r\nliberty in many a detail.\r\n\r\nFrom birth to death the State, even under present conditions, steps in\r\nat point after point to direct one's path. Within forty days of being\r\nborn I am compelled by the State to be registered; within three months I\r\nam equally constrained to be vaccinated; from five years old to\r\nthirteen, with certain limitations, I have to be sent to school; and,\r\nshould my parents be so sensible as to apprentice me to a trade, a fee\r\nhas to be paid to the State for the indentures. When I marry it is at a\r\nState-licensed institution; when I die it is by a State-appointed\r\nofficer that my decease is certified. And in the interval, the State\r\nprevents me from obtaining intoxicating liquor except from certain\r\nindividuals and within specified hours; it compels me, if I am a\r\nhouse-owner, to effect my sanitary arrangements in a given way; and if I\r\nam a house-holder, to keep my pavement free from snow. From the highest\r\ndetails to the lowest, then, the State even now interferes; whether I\r\nfail to have my child vaccinated or my chimney swept, it steps in; and\r\nthose who argue that Individualism is a theory so true that\r\nState-interference should be abolished, have a number of fruits of that\r\nState-interference to get rid of before they can claim the victory.\r\n\r\nBut probably even those who imagine that they are extreme Individualists\r\nwould not wish to remove from the Statute Book such specimens of\r\nState-interference as are now upon it. If they did, the clearance would\r\nindeed be great. For imagine what the effect would be if, in addition to\r\nthe other measures indicated, we got rid of all the enactments affecting\r\nlabour, and again allowed the employment of climbing boys as\r\nchimney-sweeps, of women and small children in mines, of men and women\r\nin white-lead works without precaution of any kind, of sailors in the\r\nmerchant service without the protection of lime-juice against scurvy and\r\nof survey against sinking; picture what the population of our\r\nmanufacturing districts would by this time have become without the\r\nprotection afforded by the Factory Acts; remember what an improvement\r\nhas been made in the way of guarding dangerous machinery, owing to the\r\npenalties inflicted upon careless owners by the Employers' Liability\r\nAct; and then answer whether State-interference is necessarily a bad\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits which experience has shown to be desirable, it is a\r\ngood thing; and it is no answer to this assumption that it has sometimes\r\nfailed to secure the object aimed at. As long as nothing in this world\r\nis perfect, we cannot expect the action of the State to be; the only\r\ntest in every case is an average test. If such State-interference as we\r\nsee has on the whole done well, the balance must be struck in its\r\nfavour; and in human affairs a favourable balance is all we have a right\r\nto anticipate.\r\n\r\nThe Individualistic ideal may be a good one, but it is the\r\nIndividualistic real we have to examine. And what would become of the\r\npoor, the weak, and the helpless if the State stood aside from all\r\ninterference with the affairs of men? That the rich and the powerful\r\nwould grind them to powder in their struggles for more riches and\r\ngreater power. The days of universal brotherhood have never\r\nexisted--and, what is more, never will exist--and that State which\r\nprotects the weak against the strong and the poor against the rich is\r\nthe best worth striving for.\r\n\r\nAn ideal condition of society would be that in which every able-bodied\r\nperson would have to work for a living with body, brains, or both; but\r\nbirth and bullion play so large a part under present circumstances that,\r\nwhile we may sigh for the ideal, we must recognize the real. And this\r\napplies to all thinkers on our social affairs--to the extreme Socialist\r\nas to the extreme Individualist. The mystery of life cannot be solved by\r\nlogic, and the pain, the poverty, and the crime which that mystery\r\ninvolves dissipated by law.\r\n\r\nIt must constantly also be borne in mind that mankind is not governed\r\nby material considerations alone, but is largely swayed by sentiment;\r\nand any system which ignores this and treats men simply as calculating\r\nmachines is bound to fail. Thus it is that, while men accept the latest\r\ndoctrines of social science, they do not act upon them. They sympathize\r\nwith Mr. Spencer's account of an ideal State in which the governmental\r\npower is the least possible, but they pay the education rate, support\r\ncompulsory vaccination, and express not the slightest wish to see\r\npublic-houses open all night. It is in this as in other theoretical\r\naffairs--our minds agree, but our hearts arbitrate. A parent may accept\r\nmost thoroughly the doctrine of the survival of the fittest, but he will\r\nstrive his utmost to preserve life to a crippled or lunatic child. And a\r\ntrader may indicate assent when he hears that the employed ought to be\r\npaid only the amount which would secure similar services in the labour\r\nmarket; but, if he is even commonly honest in his dealings with his\r\nfellows, he will not discharge an old servant because he can obtain\r\nanother for something less.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner do some men secure a fact than it begets a theory, and\r\ntruth thus becomes the father of many lies. It is well enough that every\r\none should strive to be independent of external help, but it is not\r\nwithin the bounds of the possible that every one can be perfectly so;\r\nand that being the case, the State, as the protector of all, is bound to\r\ninterfere. What has to be decided is the limit of such interference; and\r\nalthough upon that point no precise line can be drawn, for as conditions\r\nvary so must the limit change, discussion may serve to show that all the\r\ntruth lies in neither of the contending theories, but in a judicious use\r\nof both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.--HOW FAR SHOULD THE STATE INTERFERE?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo precisely limit the interference of the State in private affairs has\r\nbeen urged to be impossible, for the boundaries of such interference are\r\never changing, and will continue ever to change as the circumstances\r\nvary. In some respects the State has more to say about our domestic\r\nconcerns, in others less, than it formerly had; but there never was a\r\ntime when it left us altogether alone, and there is never likely to be.\r\n\r\nWhen people groan about \"grandmotherly government,\" and talk hazily of\r\n\"good old times\" when such was unknown, they speak with little knowledge\r\nof the social history of England. They forget that there was a day when\r\nunder penalty men had to put out their fires at a given hour; that later\r\nthey were directed to dress in a fashion presumed to be becoming to\r\ntheir several ranks; that at one period they had to profess Catholicism\r\nunder fear of the fagot, and at another Protestantism under penalty of\r\nthe rope; that in later days they had to go to church to escape being\r\nfined, and even until this century had to take the Sacrament in order to\r\nqualify for office; that in other times they were allowed to bury their\r\ndead only in certain clothing; that a section of them had to give six\r\ndays in the year to the repair of the highways; and that in divers\r\nfurther ways their individual liberty was fettered in a fashion which\r\nwould not now be tolerated for a day.\r\n\r\nThe State, in fact, has always claimed to be all-powerful, and has never\r\nassigned set limits to its demands. It has asserted, and still asserts,\r\nrights over that which is intangible, which it has not created, and\r\nwhich in its origin is superhuman. If a man has used a stream for his\r\nown purposes for a given period, the State secures him a right of use,\r\nprotecting him from interference in or providing him compensation for\r\nthat which neither he nor the State made or purchased. If another has a\r\nwindow which is threatened with being darkened by a newer building\r\nadjacent, the State steps in to assure him of the retention of his\r\n\"ancient light.\" And when people have for a series of years walked\r\nwithout hindrance across land belonging to others, the State gives to\r\nthe commonalty a right of way, which, however seemingly intangible,\r\noften seriously deteriorates the value of the property over which it is\r\nexercised.\r\n\r\nIn the gravest concerns of man as well as in those which merely affect\r\nhis comfort or his purse, the State intervenes. It used to assert by\r\nmeans of the press-gang its right to seize men for service in war; and\r\nit could at this day order a conscription which would compel all in the\r\nprime of life to pass under the military yoke. It can and does direct\r\nproperty to be seized for public purposes, upon compensation paid, from\r\nan unwilling owner; and it can and does take out of our pockets a\r\nproportion of our income, which proportion it has the power to largely\r\nincrease, in order to pay its way.\r\n\r\nThat which does all these things is for convenience called \"the State,\"\r\nbut in present circumstances it is really ourselves. The nation is\r\nsimply the aggregate of the citizens who compose it, and each one of\r\nus--especially each possessor of a vote--is a distinct portion of the\r\nState. The misfortune which attends upon the frequent use of the word is\r\nthat many persons seem to think that there is some mystic power called\r\n\"the State\" or \"the Government,\" which can dispense favours, spend\r\nmoney, and do great things--all from within itself. But neither State\r\nnor Government has any money save that which we give it, and no power\r\nexcept that which is accorded by the constituencies. And, therefore,\r\nwhen people cry out for \"the State\" to do this or \"the Government\" to do\r\nthat, they should remember that _they_ are portions of the force they\r\nbeseech, and that if what is to be done costs money they will have to\r\npay their share; and this much it is highly useful to recollect when\r\nappeals are more and more being made to the State for help.\r\n\r\nLet us start, therefore, with the conviction that the State, which is\r\nsimply ourselves and others like us, has no power beyond what the people\r\ngive it, and no money but what the people pay; that it has throughout\r\nour history attempted to solve social problems, and is doing so still;\r\nand that it is as sure as anything human can be that if it did not\r\ninterfere in certain cases to aid the struggling, to put a curb upon the\r\ntyrannous, and to regulate divers specified affairs, the poor and the\r\nhelpless would be the principal sufferers, and greed of gain and lust of\r\npower would be in the ascendant.\r\n\r\nBut it would be easy to push this interference too far. Admitted that\r\nthe State has done certain things for us, and, in the main, done them\r\nwell, this affords no argument that it should do everything in the hope\r\nthat equal success would follow. There is an assumption dear to pedants\r\nand schoolboys that because one does _this_ he is bound to do _that_,\r\nbut neither our daily lives nor our State concerns are or ought to be so\r\ngoverned. They are largely regulated by circumstances, with the idea of\r\ndoing the best possible under existing conditions. For there is no\r\ninfallible scheme of government or of society, and the system must be\r\nmade to suit the people and not the people to suit the system.\r\n\r\nAnd although the State, in certain departments of its interference, has\r\ndone well, it has not brilliantly succeeded where it has entered into\r\ncompetition with private enterprise. Just as public companies are worked\r\nat a greater cost than the same concerns in the hands of individual\r\nproprietors, so Government enterprises are always highly expensive and\r\noften disastrous failures. It did not need the recent revelations\r\nconcerning the waste, the jobbery, and the wanton extravagance of\r\ncertain of our departments to inform those who knew anything of the\r\npublic offices or the Government dockyards, that such things were the\r\ncustomary results of the system. Stroll through a private dockyard and\r\nthen through a public one; visit a large mercantile office and then a\r\nGovernment department in Whitehall; and decide whether the State is a\r\nmodel master. It may be said that it is simply the system that is to\r\nblame, but surely the universality of evil result from the same cause\r\nshould teach a lesson.\r\n\r\nThere may be asserted the possible exception of the Post-office to the\r\ncharge that the State fails where it competes with private enterprise;\r\nand no one would deny that that department does good work, and that, if\r\nall others were like it, there would be less reason to complain. But it\r\nmust not be forgotten that the Post-office, as far as the main portion\r\nof its business--letter-carrying--is concerned, does not compete with\r\nprivate enterprise, for it possesses by law the monopoly of the work;\r\nand that the cheapness of postage, upon which it prides itself, is\r\nlargely secured by making the people of London pay at least twice as\r\nmuch as they would if competition existed for the letters they send\r\namong themselves, in order that they and others may, for the same money,\r\nforward letters to Perth or Penzance. As to the Government monopoly of\r\nthe telegraphs, the result, while beneficial in a certain degree, has\r\nhad this effect--it has partially strangled the telephone system; and\r\nthat will hardly be claimed as a triumph.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion, therefore, for making the State interfere still further\r\nwith private enterprise ought to be most carefully weighed. The question\r\nreally is whether it has not already done as much in this direction as\r\nit ought, and whether, generally speaking, the limits now laid down are\r\nnot sufficiently broad.\r\n\r\nWhat it does is this: it undertakes by means of an army and navy our\r\nexternal defence; secures by the police our internal safety; makes\r\nprovision by which no person need starve; enforces upon all a certain\r\namount of education; and enjoins a set of sanitary regulations for the\r\nprotection of the community from infectious or contagious disease. These\r\nare the main items of its work, but beyond them it provides the means of\r\ncommunication by post and telegraph; fixes in certain degree the fares\r\non railways and the price of gas; encourages thrift by the institution\r\nof savings banks; and gives us all an opportunity for religious exercise\r\nby the provision of an Established Church.\r\n\r\nThe objectionable part of this is that which directly interferes with\r\npersonal opinion or private enterprise. The noble saying of\r\nCromwell--\"The State, in choosing men to serve it, takes no notice of\r\ntheir opinions; if they be willing faithfully to serve it, that\r\nsatisfies\"--spoken before its time, as even some of the Protector's\r\nfriends may have considered, must now be extended to the contention that\r\nthe State has no concern whatever with the opinions of its citizens, and\r\nthat it ought not to endow any sect at the expense of the rest.\r\nConcerning the competition with private enterprise, the State, in\r\nproviding a system of national education and a postal and telegraph\r\nservice, has gone to the verge of what it should do in such a direction.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the State should not abandon any function it now\r\nexercises, the severest caution ought to be used before another is\r\nundertaken. All attempts of the ruling power to interfere too closely\r\nwith the private concerns of men--as witness the sumptuary laws and\r\nthose against usury--have defeated themselves, and it is not for us to\r\nrevive systems of interference which, even in the Middle Ages, broke\r\ndown. It is no answer that some things are going so badly that\r\nState-interference may be considered absolutely necessary, and that it\r\nis merely the extremity of nervousness that hinders the experiment being\r\ntried. Caution is not cowardice, and no man is called upon to be\r\nfoolhardy to prove his freedom from fear.\r\n\r\nWhen it is said that, in certain directions, matters have come to such a\r\npass that the State must more actively interfere, let us note that\r\nextremes meet upon this as upon so many other matters; for the cry that\r\n\"the country is going to the dogs\" is nowadays raised as lustily by some\r\nfriends of the working man as ever it has been by the retired colonels\r\nand superannuated admirals whose exclusive possession it was so long.\r\nAnd the remedy suggested is that the State should do this, that, and the\r\nother, with an utter ignoring of the fact, which all history proves,\r\nthat the creation of an additional army of officials would strangle\r\nenterprise and stifle invention. Thus from the general, it will be\r\nnecessary to go to the particular, and to ask how far the proposed\r\nremedy would be effectual. The principle here argued is that the State\r\nshould concern itself simply with external defence, internal safety,\r\nthe protection of those unable to guard themselves, and the undertaking\r\nof such work for the general good as cannot be better done by private\r\nenterprise; and this principle holds good against many a nostrum now put\r\nforward as an infallible remedy for social ills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--SHOULD THE STATE REGULATE LABOUR OR WAGES?\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many social questions which the pressure of circumstances may\r\nsoon make political is that of the State regulation of the hours of\r\nlabour. The president of the Trades Union Congress for 1887 advocated,\r\nfor instance, the passing of an Eight Hours Bill; and it is desirable to\r\nconsider whether this would in any respect be a step in a right\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe argument for such a measure appears in principle to be this: that\r\nthe classes dependent upon manual labour for their livelihood have too\r\nmany hands for the work there is to do; that those who do get work toil\r\ntoo long; and that both evils would be remedied by restricting the hours\r\nof labour, more men thus finding employment and all working well within\r\ntheir strength.\r\n\r\nAgainst these points may be set others: that England has already been\r\nseverely affected by competition with countries where the hours are\r\nlonger and the pay less; that any further restriction of hours without a\r\ncorresponding reduction of pay would be ruinous to our trade; and that\r\nit is highly probable that the majority of workmen would prefer to\r\nlabour for nine hours at their present wages than for eight hours at\r\nless. The last contention, of course, might be answered by an enactment\r\nfixing not only the hours to be worked but the wages to be paid. If this\r\nis wished for, it should be clearly put; but before any step is taken\r\ntowards either such measure, several points concerning each, which now\r\nappear more than doubtful, should be made clear.\r\n\r\nA fallacy underlying much of the contention in favour of any such\r\nenactment is the idea that the community is divided into two distinct\r\nclasses--the producing and the consuming. As a fact, there are no\r\nproducers who do not consume, though there are some consumers who do not\r\nproduce. But is even that an unmixed evil? There is a further fallacy\r\nwhich arbitrarily divides us into capitalists and labourers; but every\r\nman who can purchase the result of another's labour is a capitalist, and\r\nthat much-denounced person will never be got rid of as long as it is\r\neasier to buy than to make.\r\n\r\nA third class which secures the condemnation of many is \"the\r\nmiddle-man.\" It is easy to denounce him, but he is a necessity at once\r\nof commerce and of comfort. If one wants some coffee at breakfast, he\r\ncannot go to Java for the berry, the West Indies for the sugar, the\r\ndairy-farm for the milk, and the Potteries for the cup from which to\r\ndrink. So far from the middle-man unduly increasing the price of those\r\narticles, he lessens it by dealing in bulk with what it would pay\r\nneither the producer nor the purchaser to deal with in small quantities;\r\nand not only lessens the price but, in regard to the commodities of a\r\ndistant land, renders it practically possible for us to have them at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt is equally useless to rail at competition as if it were inherently\r\nevil, for there will be competition as long as men exist to struggle for\r\nsupremacy. And competition keeps the world alive, as the tide prevents\r\nthe sea from stagnating. Occasionally the waves break their bounds, and\r\nloss and tribulation result; but the power for good must not be ignored,\r\nbecause the power for evil is sometimes prominent.\r\n\r\nTo talk of the working classes as if they thought and acted in a body is\r\nanother delusion. Not only this. The frequent assumption that somebody\r\nor other can speak on behalf of \"the people\" is a mistake. When it is\r\ndone, one is entitled to ask what the phrase means? \"The people\" are the\r\nwhole body of the population, and no one section, even if a majority has\r\na right to exclusively claim the title. In legislating, regard must be\r\nhad to the interests of all and not to those of a part, however\r\nnumerous; and this brings us straight to the question of interfering by\r\nenactment with the price or the amount of labour.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note that the demand which is now being raised by some\r\nTrade Unionists on behalf of labour is similar in principle to that\r\nwhich was used for centuries by the propertied classes against labour.\r\nThe Statute of Labourers, passed in the reign of Edward III., fixed\r\nwages in most precise fashion, settling that of a master mason, for\r\ninstance, at fourpence and of journeymen masons at threepence a day. And\r\nas lately as only eight years after George III. came to the throne, all\r\nmaster tailors in London and for five miles round were forbidden under\r\nheavy penalties from giving, and their workmen from accepting, more than\r\n2s. 71/2d. a day--except in the case of a general mourning. Subsequently,\r\nstatesmen grew more wise, and, in the closing years of last century, the\r\nyounger Pitt refused to support a bill to regulate the wages of\r\nlabourers in husbandry. But it is singular that, whereas Adam Smith\r\ncould say that \"whenever the Legislature attempts to regulate the\r\ndifference between masters and their workmen, its counsellors are always\r\nthe masters,\" to-day it is the workmen who promise to become so.\r\n\r\nIf it be replied that it is State interference with the hours alone and\r\nnot with the wages that is demanded, it may be submitted that if the one\r\nis done it will be a hardship to the worker rather than a boon if the\r\nother be not attempted. For, if a man, by working nine hours a day,\r\ncould earn, say, 27s. a week, it is obvious that for eight hours a day\r\nhe would not earn more in the same period than 24s., unless Parliament\r\ninsisted that he should receive the higher sum for the less work. But is\r\nParliament likely to do anything of the kind; if it did do it, would it\r\nbe found to be practicable; and, if it were found to be practicable,\r\nwould it be just?\r\n\r\nParliament is not likely to do anything of the kind, because the\r\nexperience of centuries has taught us that it is impossible to fix wages\r\nby statute. It was tried over and over again, first by enactments\r\napplying to the whole country, and then by regulations for each county,\r\nsettled by the local justices of the peace; but, though the experiment\r\nwas backed by all the forces of law, it broke down so utterly that in\r\ntime it had to be got rid of.\r\n\r\nEven if the return could be secured of a majority to Parliament pledged\r\nto the proposal, would it be likely to be any more practicable to-day\r\nthan it was in olden times? We are now an open market for the world. If\r\nhours were lessened and wages not reduced, imported articles from\r\nforeign countries would become much cheaper than our own goods, and\r\nwould be bought to the detriment of English workers. Is it proposed by\r\nthe promoters of a compulsory eight-hours working day that we should\r\nhave Protection once more, and a prohibitory tariff placed upon all\r\nmanufactured goods brought from abroad in order to keep up the price of\r\nEnglish articles?\r\n\r\nAnd, further, if it were practicable, would it be just? It would be\r\nunjust to the employers, who would have to pay present prices for\r\nlessened work; it would be unjust to the toilers, in that it would\r\nprevent them from making a higher income by working more; and it would\r\nbe unjust to the consumers, in making them give a greater price for the\r\ncommodities they required. Those who propose the compulsory eight hours\r\nwould presumably wish wages to be maintained at the present standard; it\r\nwould hardly be a popular cry if it would have the effect of bringing\r\nwages down.\r\n\r\nIf the Legislature is to interfere at all in this direction, the old\r\nproposal had better be put forward at once--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Eight hours' work, eight hours' play,\r\n     Eight hours' sleep, and eight shillings a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, at least, would have the merit of simplicity, and the more\r\ncomprehensive proposal is as just and as practicable as the limited one\r\nnow put forward. But even as to the limited one, it would be well to\r\nknow how far and to what persons it would be applied. If the answer is\r\n\"The working classes,\" the further question is \"How are these to be\r\ndefined?\" Sailors, for instance, are working men, but no one would\r\nseriously propose to apply the eight hours' system to them. Granting\r\nthey form an extreme exception, how are we to deal with shopkeepers and\r\nall whom they employ? The shopkeepers may be put aside as \"capitalists\"\r\nor \"middle men,\" and, therefore, undeserving of sympathy or\r\nconsideration; but those behind their counters are distinctly workers.\r\nAre they all to be included in the eight hours' proposal? If so, either\r\none of two things: the shops will be shut sixteen hours out of the\r\ntwenty-four, or their keepers will have to employ half as many hands\r\nagain as they now do. \"Good for the unemployed\" may be replied, but who\r\nwould have to pay for the additional labour? The consumers, of course,\r\nfor no law is going to be passed keeping tea and sugar, hats and coats\r\nat their present price; and it would be those that live by weekly wages\r\nwho would thereby suffer the most. And if, in order to obviate such\r\nconsequences, all who work in shops were to be excluded from the\r\nbenefits of an Eight Hours Act, it would be grossly unjust that tens of\r\nthousands of toilers, as much entitled to consideration as those\r\nemployed in any factory or mill, should be kept at work in order to\r\nminister to the convenience of their fellows, set free from a portion of\r\ntheir labour by the action of Parliament.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads to a consideration of the proposal that all shops, with\r\ncertain limited exceptions, shall be closed at a given hour. For the\r\ngeneral reasons applicable to other employments, any such proposition\r\nought to be strongly opposed. It would be a grievous hardship to the\r\nsmaller tradesmen, with many of whom the best chance of making a living\r\nis after the great establishments have closed, and an intolerable\r\nnuisance to the working classes who can only shop at what a legislator\r\nmight consider a late hour. If attempted to be put in operation, it\r\nwould necessitate the creation of an army of informers and inspectors to\r\nsee that it was not evaded, and it would create an amount of annoyance\r\nto honest and hard-working traders for which no expected benefits from\r\nit could compensate. The small tradesman, threatened by the co-operative\r\nsociety on the one side and the \"monster emporium\" on the other, has\r\nenough to do to live, without being harassed by a law which he would be\r\ntempted constantly to evade, and which, if not evaded, might prove his\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nMuch the same argument may be used concerning a point which, if the\r\nState interferes with the hours of labour, is certain to be raised, for\r\nit would have to be plainly stated whether all men would be forbidden\r\nunder penalty to work overtime. If any such proposal is to be made, how\r\nis it to be carried out? Are we to have an additional body of\r\ninspectors, prying into every man's house to see whether extra work was\r\nbeing done; or is the hateful system of \"the common informer\" to be\r\nrevived for the special benefit of working men?\r\n\r\nThe argument is not weakened by the fact that, in various directions,\r\nnot only has the Legislature passed enactments interfering with the\r\namount and the price of labour, but that some of these continue in\r\nactive operation. By means of the Factory Acts, for instance, it has\r\ndirectly intervened for the protection of women and children, and in so\r\ndoing has been acting within that part of its duty which demands that it\r\nshall stand between the unprotected and overwhelming power. But there is\r\nno strict parallel between the case of the adult males of the working\r\nclasses and that of those women and children who have to toil. The\r\nformer have again and again shown their power of preserving their own\r\ninterests by combination; and the evils of State interference where it\r\ncan possibly be avoided appear sufficient to induce the belief that it\r\nis to combination that the working classes ought still to trust. If they\r\ncannot by this means put down overtime--and as yet they have not been\r\nable to do so--they cannot expect their countrymen to raise prices and\r\nrun the risk of commercial ruin by doing for them what they ought to be\r\nable to do for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV.--SHOULD THE STATE INTERFERE WITH PROPERTY?\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving dealt with the manner in which the State interferes with labour,\r\nwhich to most is their only property, it is necessary to consider how it\r\ndeals with capital, which is the fruit of labour, and how it thus\r\ninterferes with some of what are termed \"the rights of property.\"\r\n\r\nThis has been done in order to avoid greater ills, as in the case of the\r\nfixing of fair rents by judicial courts in Ireland and certain districts\r\nof the Highlands of Scotland; in others to prevent endless dispute and\r\nloss, as in the disposal, in specified proportions, of the personal\r\nproperty of those who die without a will; in a further series to prevent\r\na virtual monopoly from becoming tyrannous, as in the compulsion of\r\nrailway companies to run certain third-class trains, and not to charge\r\nbeyond a stated fare, or the restriction of the profits of gas companies\r\nto 10 per cent. unless a specified reduction in price is made to the\r\nconsumers; in others, yet, for the supposed advantage of a class, as in\r\nthe custom of primogeniture, which gives all real property (that is,\r\nland) to the eldest son of a father who dies intestate; and, in others,\r\nfor the presumed benefit of the community, at the expense of individual\r\nefforts, as in the limitation of the duration of patents for inventions\r\nto seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years, and of copyright in books to\r\nforty-two years from the date of publication, or for the author's life\r\nand seven years after, whichever of these terms may be the longer.\r\n\r\nAs to the first three points--the fixing of fair rents in Ireland and\r\nthe Highlands, the due division of the personal property of those who\r\ndie without a will, and the limitation of the power of virtual\r\nmonopolies--there is no need at this day to argue, for all are\r\nirrevocable. As to the fourth, there is no practical disagreement among\r\nleading politicians on both sides regarding the desirability of doing\r\naway with the custom of primogeniture, as enforced by law. But as to the\r\nfifth, it may be submitted that the State goes too far or not far\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nOur legislators have been exceedingly tender towards every description\r\nof property except that created by certain of the highest phases of\r\nbrain-power. If a man invents a machine which may save millions to the\r\ncommunity, he loses all specific property in his invention after a given\r\nperiod of years; if he writes a book which may elevate mankind, his\r\nfamily are similarly condemned after a certain period to forfeit all\r\nclaim upon the fruits of his labour. But if, instead of putting his\r\nbrain to such uses, he merely makes a machine or lends a book for hire,\r\nthere is no law to step in and deprive him of the profits if either\r\nmachine or book lasts a century.\r\n\r\nWhy this difference? The theory appears to be that the community is\r\nentitled to profit after a certain period by the brains of its members,\r\nwhen used in the creative or inventive direction; but if the claim be\r\ngood, has not the State an equal right to profit after a similar period\r\nby the brains of its members when used in trading ways? Why should\r\nbrains exercised in one direction be handicapped in comparison with\r\nthose exercised in another? The answer may be that the inventor or\r\nauthor employs no capital, that the trader does, and that, therefore,\r\nwhatever profit the former is allowed to make is a profit upon nothing,\r\nwhile in the latter case the profit is directly upon the capital\r\nemployed, which ought not to be interfered with.\r\n\r\nBut this is to adopt the fallacy that capital is necessarily the same\r\nthing as money. The capital of an inventor or an author is his brains,\r\nwhich he expends upon his invention or his book; and the community has\r\nexactly the same right to deprive the widow and the orphan of a fortune\r\nbecause it was made by a lucky speculation, for instance, forty-two\r\nyears before, as of their property in a book because it was published\r\nthat length of time previous. It is true that the State does not fully\r\nexercise this right, and protects the family of the mere money-maker\r\nwhile it despoils that of the brain-worker; but the principle is one\r\nwhich contains larger possibilities than the former have yet realized.\r\n\r\nThe argument that it is for the benefit of the community that only a\r\ncertain amount of time should be given to the inventor or the author in\r\nwhich to make a profit is dangerous, because it can so easily be applied\r\nto other species of property. Why not to the body of the machine as well\r\nas to its principle, why not to the pages of the book as well as to what\r\nthey contain? And even if it is never pushed so far, there are certain\r\nspecies of property now protected by the law which will not improbably\r\nbe attacked upon this same ground of \"the benefit of the community\"\r\nbefore very long; and it is difficult to see how they can be defended as\r\nlong as the statutes affecting copyright and patents exist.\r\n\r\nThe most striking of such kinds of property is that in minerals. A man\r\nbuys an estate for farming, grazing, or, it may be, purposes of\r\npleasure. Some time afterwards minerals are found beneath it, and,\r\nthough he has neither placed them there nor may assist to get them out,\r\nhe is privileged to charge \"mining royalties\" upon every ton that is\r\nraised as long as there is any to be obtained. Why should not his power\r\nin this direction be limited? He takes everything and gives nothing; the\r\nauthor or inventor gives everything and takes little. It would be as\r\nmuch for \"the benefit of the community\" to have the former's minerals\r\nafter a given period, with no reward to himself, as to have the latter's\r\nbooks or machines. Why, then, should bullion be carefully protected and\r\nbrains despoiled? If it be replied that when a man has bought a plot of\r\nground it is his to the centre of the earth at one side and to the sky\r\non the other, may it not be submitted that the former portion of the\r\nright ought to be restricted, while the latter certainly does not exist,\r\nfor the law steps in at point after point to control his use of the land\r\nbetween the surface and the sky?\r\n\r\nThe State, therefore, interferes with property, as it is, in a most\r\nmaterial degree: instances of such interference have been scattered\r\nthrough these pages, and the tendency of the future is likely to be\r\ntowards more than less interference. And there is hardly any that can be\r\nproposed, even of the extremest kind, for which it would not be possible\r\nto find a precedent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV.--OUGHT THE STATE TO FIND FOOD AND WORK FOR ALL?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State thus interfering with both capital and labour, it is sometimes\r\ncontended that its duties ought to be so extended as to find food and\r\nwork for all. There is a captivating sound about the proposition which\r\nhas commended it to many without a due weighing of the probable results.\r\nIt is a matter upon which a hasty generalization, though springing from\r\nthe purest motives, may do vast harm, and is one, therefore, which all\r\nought most carefully to consider before expressing an opinion upon it.\r\n\r\nCardinal Manning, in an article published in the winter of 1887, carried\r\nthe theory of the public duty of feeding the hungry to its extremest\r\npoint in these words--\"All men are bound by natural obligations, if they\r\ncan, to feed the hungry. But it may be said that granting the obligation\r\nin the giver does not prove a right in the receiver. To which I answer\r\nthat the obligation to feed the hungry springs from the natural right of\r\nevery man to life, and to the food necessary for the sustenance of life.\r\nSo strict is this natural right that it prevails over all positive laws\r\nof property. Necessity has no law, and a starving man has a natural\r\nright to his neighbour's bread.\"\r\n\r\nWith all deference, the last sentence must be stated to be false, both\r\nin logic and morals. If it were true, it would justify immediate raids\r\nby the starving upon the nearest baker's shop, and one wonders what the\r\nCardinal would say if he happened to be the baker. Granting that every\r\none has a right to live, there is no equivalent right to live at other\r\npeople's expense. It is true that, by our Poor Law, a system has been\r\ncreated by which no one need starve, but that does not justify the theft\r\nof bread. There is a preliminary question to be put even in the case of\r\nthe starving, and that is as to why they are in that condition. If it be\r\nbecause they have been idle, or drunken, or generally worthless, as in\r\nmany cases it is, the mere fact that they are starving does not entitle\r\nthem to sack a baker's shop. They will be fed by the Poor Law if they\r\ntake the necessary steps, but if they are able-bodied they will have to\r\nwork for their food; and as most human beings have to do the same, where\r\nis the hardship?\r\n\r\nIt will be replied by some that the Poor Law works harshly towards the\r\ndeserving poor, but that is an argument for amendment, not for abolition\r\nor indiscriminate extension. And if it be further said that the food\r\nsupplied is meagre and the lodgings rough, it must be remembered that\r\nthe poor-rate is paid by a very large number whose food is no more\r\nplentiful and whose lodgings are certainly worse. As for the argument\r\nthat some people starve rather than \"enter the house,\" it is not easy to\r\nsee what relief could be given by the State without infringing that\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nBut there is a question most intimately affecting this matter which,\r\nthough of the highest importance, cannot be discussed here as it\r\ndeserves, and that is the question of population, concerning which Mill\r\ntruly says, \"Every one has a right to live. We will suppose this\r\ngranted. But no one has a right to bring creatures into life, to be\r\nsupported by other people. Whoever means to stand upon the first of\r\nthese rights must renounce all pretension to the last. If a man cannot\r\nsupport even himself unless others help him, those others are entitled\r\nto say that they do not also undertake the support of any offspring\r\nwhich it is physically possible for him to summon into the world.... It\r\nwould be possible for the State to guarantee employment at ample wages\r\nto all who are born. But if it does this, it is bound in\r\nself-protection, and for the sake of every purpose for which government\r\nexists, to provide that no person shall be born without its consent....\r\nIt cannot, with impunity, take the feeding upon itself and leave the\r\nmultiplying free.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, while the Poor Law ought to be carried out in the humanest and\r\nmost liberal fashion compatible with the interests of the poor who pay\r\nthe rates as well as the poor who benefit by them, any movement for so\r\nextending it as to bring more persons under its operation, and thus to\r\nfurther pauperize the community, would be dangerous. We had enough of\r\nthat under the system swept away by the Act of 1834, the hideous\r\ndemoralization caused by which should be studied to-day by those who are\r\neager for a freer dispensation of State relief.\r\n\r\nThe arguments against the State going further than at present in the\r\ndirection of giving food to all are equally good as against providing\r\nwork for all. Relief works have ever been centres of corruption and\r\nwaste of the worst type, while \"national workshops\" have not been so\r\nbrilliant a success in the form of dockyards and arsenals as to warrant\r\nan extension of the system to all the trades we practise.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the State is bound to provide work for all was never\r\nmore concisely put than in the original draft of the French Republican\r\nConstitution after the Revolution of 1848, the seventh article of which\r\nran thus: \"The right of labour is the right which every man has to live\r\nby his labour. It is the duty of Society, through the channels of\r\nproduction and other means at its command, hereafter to be organized, to\r\nprovide work for such able-bodied men as cannot find it for themselves.\"\r\nBut even a Government imbued with Socialistic tendencies found this to\r\nbe much too strong, and modified it thus: \"It is the duty of Society by\r\nfraternal assistance to protect the lives of necessitous citizens,\r\neither by finding them work as far as possible, or by providing for\r\nthose who are incapacitated for work and who have no families to support\r\nthem.\" Yet the modified form was not found to work well in actual\r\npractice, and the history of the failure of the French National\r\nWorkshops of 1848 remains as an eloquent testimony to the fact that the\r\nState ought to interfere as little as possible with industrial\r\nenterprises and private concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI.--HOW OUGHT WE TO DEAL WITH SOCIALISM?\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the considerations already put forward do not exhaust the social\r\nquestion, for only in the briefest fashion have been touched the\r\nimportant points which that question involves. And there is yet left to\r\nbe discussed the attitude which ought to be adopted towards that body of\r\nopinions upon public affairs vaguely known as \"Socialism.\"\r\n\r\nThe attitude of some is simply denunciatory, for there is a class of\r\npolitician which always imputes base motives to those with whom it\r\ndisagrees, and which is so proficient in abuse that it apparently thinks\r\nit a waste of time to argue. That class has been painfully in evidence\r\nin regard to the Socialists. It is considered that--so true is the old\r\nproverb that if you give a dog a bad name you may as well hang\r\nhim--nothing more need be done respecting a new and therefore unpopular\r\ndoctrine than to so label it as to ensure its repudiation by honest but\r\nunthinking men. And thus the name \"Socialist\" is applied as equivalent\r\nto thief; and men utterly ignorant of what the words imply link\r\nSocialist to Nihilist, Communist to Anarchist, as if each were equal to\r\neach, and all therefore equal to one another.\r\n\r\nThis has been the favourite device of the opponents of all new\r\ndoctrines, political or social, philosophical or religious. To be\r\nridiculed, to be persecuted, even to be slain has been the fate of the\r\nwould-be elevators of their kind, as the roll of fame, which includes\r\nthe names of Socrates and Galileo, Luther and Savonarola, Voltaire and\r\nRoger Bacon, Mazzini and Darwin will testify. The Socialists now are\r\nhardly called worse names than were applied to geologists fifty years\r\nago, and to Evolutionists but the other day. Atheists, of course, they\r\nhave been named, for Atheist is the epithet customarily applied by\r\nignorant and bigoted men, who have made God in their own image, to those\r\nmore zealous in endeavouring to raise humanity.\r\n\r\nAgainst any such method of dealing with public questions all fair-minded\r\nmen should strongly, and without ceasing, protest. And as Socialism is\r\nspreading among the masses, it is in the highest degree important that\r\nthe fact should be studied calmly and without prejudice. Hard words\r\nbreak no bones, and contumely tends to strengthen any cause in which\r\nthere is an atom of good.\r\n\r\nSocialism, therefore, should be dealt with in an inquiring and not an\r\nabusive spirit, and with the determination to accept from it whatever of\r\ngood to the community we may find it to contain. There is another method\r\nwhich Prince Bismarck has been trying for years, and with the signal\r\nlack of success that always comes from trying to stamp out an opinion by\r\nforce of law. In presumed defence of \"society\" and \"order\"--two\r\nexcellent things, but often the excuse for despots to perpetrate cruel\r\ninjustice upon the liberty-loving and the poor--he has secured law after\r\nlaw for the purpose of \"putting down Socialism;\" men have been torn from\r\ntheir homes because of their opinions; the right of public meeting has\r\nbeen placed at the mercy of the police; the press has been gagged, and\r\nevery means taken to stamp out a body of opinions some of which even the\r\nGerman Chancellor himself cannot help sharing. And with what result?\r\nThat, after ten years of this wretched work, the Socialists--though\r\nprevented from public meeting, speaking, or writing--are multiplying in\r\nGermany in an ever-growing proportion; that in Berlin, the capital of\r\nthe empire, they number tens of thousands of electors as their\r\nadherents; and that Prince Bismarck is ever asking for extended powers\r\nto crush a force which, in its free state, as yielding to the touch as\r\nwater, is mighty when compressed.\r\n\r\nWith an even greater power of police, and no restriction at all from the\r\nlaws, the Czar has failed as signally to extirpate Nihilism. Ideas\r\ncannot be killed in this fashion, though their holders can be and are\r\nrendered more dangerous. Mill certainly considered that \"the dictum\r\nthat truth always triumphs over persecution is one of those pleasant\r\nfalsehoods which men repeat after one another till they pass into\r\ncommonplaces, but which all experience refutes;\" and he was of opinion\r\nthat \"no reasonable person can doubt that Christianity might have been\r\nextirpated in the Roman Empire.\" But it may be submitted that, when\r\narguing about the persecution of ideas to-day, we must not forget the\r\nimmense additional force given to them by means of printing. The secret\r\npresses of Germany and Russia \"spread the light;\" and there is nothing\r\nso certain as that the very charm which comes from the possession of\r\nthat which is prohibited aids in strengthening a movement which is under\r\nthe ban of the law.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, the efforts of those who would attempt to put down\r\nSocialism are not to be considered in the light of political\r\npersecution, and are not to be compared with religious persecution, for\r\nthey are directed solely to the suppression of \"anti-social\" doctrines,\r\nthe adoption of which would be fatal not only to States as they now\r\nexist, but to society itself. A more precise definition must be asked,\r\nhowever, of the doctrines thus described. Though opposed to an eight\r\nhours' bill, to land nationalization, and to national workshops, leading\r\npoints in the Socialist programme, I cannot conceive how, if they were\r\nall adopted within the next year, such dire results could from them\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nEvery new body of doctrine which gives hope to the masses and threatens\r\nthe domination of the privileged among men has been described with equal\r\nvirulence by its antagonists. Read the charges upon which Christians\r\nwere condemned under the Roman Empire; read those brought against Luther\r\nand his co-reformers when first Protestantism threatened the Church of\r\nRome; remember those thrown at the Puritans when they tried to secure\r\nfor Englishmen liberty of thought and action. They were in every case\r\nthat the doctrines were anti-social; that if adopted they would wreck\r\nthe then condition of society; and that they were in the highest degree\r\nperilous to the State. For it is the fate of all preachers of a new\r\ndoctrine to be treated as rogues until their persecutors are proved to\r\nbe fools.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly there are some theories advanced by men calling themselves\r\nSocialists which, if adopted, would seriously conflict with the existing\r\norder of society; but to condemn every proposal put forward as Socialist\r\nbecause there are Socialists who have said strange, and sometimes\r\nstupid, things would be monstrous. It is a controversial trick of a\r\npeculiarly poor order to attempt to hold the leaders of any movement\r\nresponsible for the hare-brained ideas of some of their followers. Not\r\nto repudiate them is not to signify agreement, or our party leaders\r\nwould possess some of the most extravagant doctrines ever conceived by\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBesides, one must always sever the conventional beliefs from the real.\r\nNo sensible person considers Christianity untrue because even the\r\nchurches would regard him as a madman who literally adopted the\r\ninjunction to sell all that he had to give to the poor. In any body of\r\ndoctrines there are always some which its adherents hold, but do not\r\nstand by.\r\n\r\nAnd, therefore, charity as well as common sense demands that the tall\r\ntalk on both sides--for there is not a great deal to choose between them\r\nin this respect--should cease; but the trick is too easily learned to be\r\nquickly dropped. The idea of the well-to-do that all would go smoothly\r\nif it were not for \"agitators\" and \"mob-orators\" is as absurd as the\r\ncontention of the Socialist that most of our ills are due to the\r\n\"profit-monger.\" Your \"agitator\" or your \"mob-orator\" would have not the\r\nleast influence if he did not voice the feelings, the longings, and the\r\nhopes of his silent friends. And as for the \"profit-monger,\" is not the\r\nworkman who is better off than the poorest among his fellows deserving\r\nthe name?\r\n\r\nLet us have fair play all round to ideas as well as to men. If, in the\r\nsupposed interests of society, every movement designed to upraise the\r\npoor is suppressed, the tendency must be to force men towards Anarchism\r\nand Nihilism, by causing them to wish to destroy that order of things\r\nwhich to them acts so unjustly. Despair is a fatal counsellor, and those\r\nwho would identify the welfare of the State with that of the mere\r\nmoney-getter are its frequent cause. It is easier to raise the devil\r\nthan to lay him, and appeals to the merely animal instinct in\r\nman--whether to protect his own property or to take that of others,\r\nwith a complete ignoring of his duties as well as his rights--must end\r\nin ruin and shame.\r\n\r\n\"There is among the English working classes,\" once observed Sir Robert\r\nPeel, \"too much suffering and too much perplexity. It is a disgrace and\r\na danger to our civilization. It is absolutely necessary that we should\r\nrender the condition of the manual labourer less hard and less\r\nprecarious. We cannot do everything, but something may be effected, and\r\nsomething ought to be done.\" Though nearly forty years have passed since\r\nthat statesman's death, we are still groping blindly for the something\r\nwhich ought to be done for the poor; and such strength as Socialism\r\npossesses is derived from the general spread of the feeling which Peel\r\nput into words, and which no politician--much more no statesman--can\r\nafford to neglect.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why the politics of the future will be largely affected by\r\nthe social questions now coming to the front. From the opinions of many\r\nwho are pressing them forward one may profoundly differ, but justice\r\ndemands that all they advance should be examined without prejudice, and\r\nwith the determination to accept that which is good, from whatever\r\nquarter it may come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII.--WHAT SHOULD BE THE LIBERAL PROGRAMME?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the social problem, however, is developing, we have the political\r\nproblem to face; and, therefore, the immediate programme of the Liberal\r\nparty now demands consideration. In some detail have been presented the\r\narguments from a Liberal point upon all the great public questions which\r\nare either ripe or ripening for settlement. It has not been possible to\r\ngo minutely into every point involved; a broad outline of each subject\r\nhas had to suffice; but it may be trusted that each has been\r\nsufficiently explained for us now to consider which should occupy the\r\nforefront in the Liberal platform.\r\n\r\nMr. Bright observed, in days not long since, when he was honoured by\r\nevery man in the party as one of its most trusted leaders, that he\r\ndisliked programmes. What he preferred, it was evident, was that when\r\nsome great question--such as the repeal of the Corn Laws or the\r\nextension of the suffrage, with both of which his name will be ever\r\nidentified--should thrust itself to the front by force of circumstances,\r\nit should be faced by the Liberal party and dealt with on its merits;\r\nand what he opposed, it was equally evident, was the formulation of any\r\ncut-and-dried programme, containing a number of points to be accepted as\r\na shibboleth by every man calling himself Liberal or Radical, and by its\r\nhide-bound propensity tending to retard real progress.\r\n\r\nThe Irish question is one of those great matters which has thrust itself\r\nto the front by force of circumstances, which should be faced by the\r\nLiberal party and dealt with on its merits, and which, until it is so\r\nfaced and dealt with, will stand in the path of any real reforms. The\r\nevil effects of the discontent of four millions of people at our very\r\ndoors are not to be got rid of by shutting our eyes to them; and the\r\nintensification of those evil effects which is to-day going on is a\r\nmatter which must engage the attention of every Liberal.\r\n\r\nBut, out of dislike for any cut-and-dried programme of several measures\r\nto be accepted wholesale and without question, the party must not be\r\nallowed to drift into aimlessness. As long as it exists it must exist\r\nfor work, and its fruit must not be phrases but facts. Liberalism can\r\nnever return to the days when it munched the dry remainder biscuit of\r\nworn-out Whiggery. A hide-bound programme may be a bad thing, but\r\nnothing worse can be imagined than the string of airy nothings which\r\nused to do duty for a policy among the latter-day Whigs. Take the\r\naddresses issued by them at the general election of 1852 as an instance,\r\nand which have been effectively summarized thus:--\"They promised (in the\r\nwords of Sir James Graham) 'cautious but progressive reform,' and (in\r\nthose of Sir Charles Wood) 'well-advised but certain progress.' Lord\r\nPalmerston said he trusted the new Liberal Government would answer 'the\r\njust expectation of the country,' and Lord John Russell pledged it to\r\n'rational and enlightened progress.'\"\r\n\r\nNow, in these days, we want something decidedly more definite than that,\r\nand, if our leaders could offer us nothing better, we should have either\r\nto find other leaders or abandon our aims. Happily we need do neither,\r\nfor the Liberal chiefs, with Mr. Gladstone at their head, are prepared\r\nto advance with the needs of the times, and to advocate those measures\r\nwhich the circumstances demand and their principles justify.\r\n\r\nIn the forefront of our efforts at this moment stands, and must continue\r\nto stand until it is settled, the question of self-government for\r\nIreland. Stripped of all quarrel upon point of detail, the Liberal party\r\nis pledged, while upholding the unity of the Empire and the supremacy of\r\nthe Imperial Parliament, to give the sister country a representative\r\nbody sitting in Dublin to deal with exclusively Irish affairs. The day\r\ncannot be long delayed when an attempt must be made to place the local\r\ngovernment of Ireland upon a sounder and broader basis than at present.\r\nWhen it arrives, the Liberal party has its idea ready. Details can be\r\ncompromised; the principle cannot be touched. For Liberals are convinced\r\nthat, by whatever name it may be called, and by whatever party it may be\r\nintroduced, Home Rule must come, and that, for the sake of all the\r\ninterests involved, Imperial and Irish, it will be in the highest degree\r\ndesirable to grant it frankly and fully, with due regard to the\r\ninterests concerned.\r\n\r\nLinked with this point is another regarding Ireland upon which the\r\nLiberal party will entertain not the smallest doubt. The Coercion Act\r\nhas been used for partisan purposes by dependent and often incompetent\r\nmagistrates, and it must be repealed. Upon this point there can be no\r\ncompromise. Every man hoping to be returned by Liberal votes at the next\r\nelection must pledge himself to the immediate, total, and unconditional\r\nrepeal of the Crimes Act of 1887.\r\n\r\nThe next item in the accepted Liberal programme is the disestablishment\r\nof the Church in Wales, as well as of the Scottish Kirk. Each is a\r\npurely domestic matter which ought to be settled according to the wishes\r\nof the majority of the people affected. As to the wishes of Wales, no\r\none can have a doubt; and though the declaration of Scotland, through\r\nits representatives, is not so emphatic, it is sufficiently clear for\r\nLiberals to support the demand.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, these points touch only Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.\r\nEngland is the largest portion of this kingdom, and its claims must not\r\nbe ignored. A great Parisian editor used to say that the description of\r\na woman run over on the Boulevards was of more interest to his readers\r\nthan that of a battle on the Nile. It would be well if politicians would\r\ntake this idea to heart. Little use is it to talk of the despotism\r\npractised in Ireland, of the hardships endured by the crofters in\r\nScotland, and of the injustice done to the tithepayers in Wales, if we\r\nare not prepared to apply the same principles to London as to Limerick,\r\nto Chester as to Cardigan, and to Liverpool as to the Lews. The average\r\nman will not be satisfied of the sincerity of those who keep their eyes\r\nfixed upon distant places, and are full of sympathy for the oppressed\r\nwho are afar off, but can spare no time for the grievances existing at\r\ntheir doors.\r\n\r\nAnd as, therefore, if Liberalism is to be again in the ascendant in the\r\ncouncils of the Empire, England must be won, it is well to emphasize the\r\ncontention that England will never be won by a party which ignores her\r\nwants. Home Rule for Ireland, disestablishment for Scotland and Wales,\r\nare good things, and they will have to be granted when our majority\r\ncomes; but what will that majority do for England?\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to lay down a programme, it may be said that there is\r\none English problem to which Liberalism will have at once to apply\r\nitself, and that is the problem of the land. The time is past for\r\ntalking comfortable platitudes upon this matter, for we find that Tories\r\ncan do that as glibly as Liberals, and with the same lack of good\r\nresult. The very least that can be demanded--in addition to the\r\nabolition of the custom of primogeniture and an extensive simplification\r\nof the process of transfer--is a thorough reform of the laws affecting\r\nsettlement, the taxing of land at death in the same proportion as other\r\ndescriptions of property, the placing of the land tax upon a basis more\r\nremunerative to the Exchequer, and a large measure of leasehold\r\nenfranchisement. And when candidates talk in future of being in favour\r\nof \"land reform,\" they must be definitely pinned down as to their views\r\nupon such points as these.\r\n\r\nThat Free Trade will remain a plank in the Liberal platform, not to be\r\ndropped or tampered with, goes without saying. It is a point as much\r\nbeyond question as the existence of Parliament itself, and concerning it\r\nas much cannot be observed as regarding the latter. For, while our trade\r\nsystem must remain free, both Houses stand in need of reform. The Lords,\r\nin Mr. John Morley's phrase, must be mended or ended, and the path of\r\nlegislative progress in the Commons made more smooth. The laws in every\r\nway affecting the return of members to the latter likewise stand sorely\r\nin need of reform, and that reform cannot be ignored by the Liberal\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nFurther, Liberals are agreed that localities shall have greater power in\r\nvarious directions, and upon the liquor traffic in especial, of\r\ndeciding upon their own affairs. The tendency of recent days has been to\r\ntake these out of the hands of those most intimately concerned, and to\r\nvest supreme power in a body of Government clerks at Whitehall. That is\r\na tendency which must be reversed. We are advocating decentralization in\r\nregard to Ireland; we are being led to advocate it in regard to Wales\r\nand Scotland; England must similarly be benefited, and the red-tape of\r\nWhitehall unwound from our purely local concerns.\r\n\r\nPeace and Retrenchment must continue to be inscribed on the Liberal\r\nbanner as well as Reform. Preference for international arbitration over\r\nwar must distinguish our party; a determination to be as free as\r\npossible from all entangling engagements with foreign powers must always\r\nbe with us. And there must ever be displayed a resolve to place the\r\nGovernment service upon the same business-like and efficient basis as\r\nprivate concerns, to get rid of the notion that it is work to be lightly\r\nundertaken and highly paid, and to emphasize the contention that the\r\ntaxbearer shall have full value from every one of his servants for the\r\nwages he pays.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the greatest care must be taken by every Liberal to\r\npreserve--aye, and to extend--individual liberty. Men cannot dance in\r\nfetters, and all enactments which unnecessarily hinder the development\r\nof private enterprise, and all traditions which interfere with the\r\nfullest enjoyment of the rights of speech and action, must be swept\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWhile thus giving our attention to the more purely political questions\r\nas they arise, Liberals must never forget that the poor we always have\r\nwith us. Ours is a gospel of hope for the oppressed; it must equally be\r\na gospel of hope for the hard-working. We want our working men to be\r\ncivil, not servile; our working women to use courtesy, and not a\r\ncurtsey. We wish to see the end of a system by which a bow is rewarded\r\nwith a blanket and a curtsey with coal. The man who too frequently bends\r\nhis back is likely to become permanently affected with a stoop, and the\r\nold order of hat-touching, bowing, and scraping must disappear. We do\r\nnot deny that it is right that men should respect others, but it is\r\noften forgotten that it is equally right that they should respect\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with things social, as well as things political, we must\r\nalways remember that it is flesh and blood with which in the result we\r\nhave to deal. Some thinkers ignore sentiment, do not believe in\r\nkindness, and treat men like machines, forgetting that even machines\r\nrequire oil. It is not for philosophers with homes and armchairs and a\r\nsettled income to ask whether life is worth living; that question is for\r\nthe poor and the lowly and the down-trodden, to whom the struggle for\r\nexistence is not a matter for theorizing or moral-drawing, but is a\r\nnever-ending, heart-breaking, soul-destroying reality.\r\n\r\nSo, if Liberalism is to live, it must be liberal in fact as well as in\r\nname. A Liberal who talks of equal rights on the platform and swears at\r\nhis servants at home, who waxes wroth against a national oppressor and\r\ntreats those poorer than himself like serfs, is as little deserving of\r\nrespect as a Liberal policy which solely considers the externals of\r\neither liberty or life. A programme based upon such a policy must fail,\r\nand deserves to fail; and if we are to have a platform at all, it must\r\nbe one upon which the rich man and the son of toil can stand side by\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.--HOW IS THE LIBERAL PROGRAMME TO BE ATTAINED?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is natural to ask how, when the Liberal programme has been framed, it\r\nis to be attained. Measures no more come with wishing than winds with\r\nwhistling; and if our principles are to be put into practice, it will\r\nonly be by our joining those of similar mind.\r\n\r\nNot every politician, even if his ideas be sound, is a practical man.\r\nThe disposition to insist that no bread is better than half a loaf is\r\none that commends itself to me neither in business nor in daily life,\r\nbut it is one upon which many a man of Liberal leanings acts, to the\r\ndetriment of the principles he professes to hold dear. Insistence upon\r\nthe one point to the exclusion of the ninety-nine, and readiness to join\r\nenemies who disagree on the whole hundred rather than friends who\r\ndisagree on only the one, are qualities unpleasantly prominent in many\r\notherwise worthy men. It cannot too often be urged that politics, like\r\nbusiness or married life, can only be carried on by occasional\r\ngive-and-take. The partner who persists in always having his own way;\r\nthe husband who is ever asserting authority over his wife; and the\r\npolitician who will never yield an iota to his friends--all are alike\r\nobjectionable, and deserve no particle of consideration from those\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nA spurious independence is another hindrance in the path of progress.\r\nFaith without works is occasionally worth commendation in public life;\r\nbut one must be certain that the faith is genuine, and for most\r\npolitical \"independence,\" that cannot be claimed. Diseased vanity,\r\ndisappointed ambition, and deliberate place-hunting have more to do with\r\nthat kind of thing than devotion to principle. \"The fact is that\r\nindividualism is very often a mere cloak for selfishness; it is the name\r\nwith which pedants justify the pragmatic intolerance which will not\r\nyield one jot of personal claim or unsatisfied vanity to secure the\r\ntriumph of the noblest cause and the highest principles.\" When Mr.\r\nChamberlain wrote those words he was undoubtedly right.\r\n\r\nWhenever, therefore, one is called upon to admire some outburst of\r\nindependence which splits a political party or hinders the progress of a\r\ncause, he should look very closely at the history of those concerned. He\r\nshould not forget that, just as there are people who are much too\r\nindependent to touch their hats for civility, though they would for a\r\nsixpence, there are politicians who are far too spirited to stick to\r\ntheir party but not to bid for place. Happily these latter seem never\r\nable to avoid using certain stock phrases, which should put others on\r\ntheir guard. When a man says he prefers country to party, or vaunts that\r\nhis motto is \"measures not men,\" he lays himself open to just suspicion,\r\nbecause he talks as political impostors have long been accustomed to\r\ntalk; when he proclaims his readiness to recognize the virtues of his\r\nenemies, you may be certain that he will speedily show himself keenly\r\nalive to the failings of his friends; and a politician never begins to\r\nboast that he is a representative and not a delegate until he has ceased\r\nto represent the opinions of those who sent him to Parliament.\r\n\r\nMore estimable than these, but still people who must not be allowed to\r\nhamper the operations of the Liberal party, are the constitutional\r\npedant and the rigid doctrinaire. Nothing is more lamentable than the\r\nendeavours of the former to prove by precedent that nothing ought to be\r\ndone in the nineteenth century differently to how it was done in the\r\nseventeenth; and nothing more filled with the promise of disappointment\r\nthan the theorizings of the latter as to what measures would secure us a\r\nperfect State.\r\n\r\nIt is with persons as well as with principles that we have to deal, and\r\nin politics we must not despise the humblest instruments. History, like\r\nthe coral reef, is made grain by grain and day by day, and often by\r\nagents as comparatively insignificant. The old idea that the people's\r\nleaders must come from \"the governing classes,\" or, better still, \"the\r\ngoverning families,\" does not harmonize with democratic institutions. As\r\nto \"the governing families\" part of it, that may be brushed aside at\r\nonce as being as absurd in theory as it is untrue to all recent English\r\nhistory; for who have been our most brilliant and successful statesmen\r\nsince the present fashion of constitutional government was established?\r\nWho were Walpole, Pitt, Burke, Fox, Canning, Peel, Cobden, Gladstone,\r\nand Disraeli? Even as this book is written the Tories in the House of\r\nCommons are nominally led by Mr. Smith, and practically by Mr. Goschen.\r\nThe instinct of the people has taught them the best leaders, as it has\r\ntaught them the best principles.\r\n\r\nA clear-headed working man is a better political counsellor than a\r\nmuddle-minded peer. There are plenty of working men who are not\r\nclear-headed, as there are plenty of peers who are not muddled of mind;\r\nbut the instinct of the mass is far more likely to be sound than that of\r\nthe class. In the course of English history the masses have usually been\r\nright and the classes wrong. The former have been less selfish, more\r\nready to redress injuries, and keener to oppose tyranny. And even where\r\nthe masses have been in the wrong, it has often been because their\r\ninstinctive sense of right has led them to sympathize with a man or a\r\ncause, undeserving of regard, but apparently exposed to the persecutions\r\nof the great.\r\n\r\nThus, in order to make the Liberal cause succeed, zeal must be combined\r\nwith unity and toleration with courage, and our energies must be so\r\nconcentrated by organization as to make them most effective when battle\r\nis joined. For the private soldiers in the great army of progress, there\r\nis no advice so sedulously to be rejected as that of Talleyrand, \"Above\r\nall, no zeal.\" If there is not within Liberals a burning desire to\r\nforward their principles, they have no right to complain if those\r\nprinciples stand still. A Liberal who is lukewarm is like a joint\r\nhalf-cooked--of no practical service until possessed of more heat; and\r\nit is the duty of every earnest man among us to keep the political oven\r\nat baking point.\r\n\r\nBut with zeal there must be unity. Differences on details must not be\r\nallowed to separate friends. There is not always a sufficiency of\r\ntolerance displayed towards those who do not see eye to eye with the\r\nothers. Agreement in principle is the pass-key which should open to all\r\nLiberals the door to unity with their brethren; divergence on detail\r\nshould be settled inside. \"Take heed,\" said Cromwell, \"of being sharp,\r\nor too easily sharpened by others, against those to whom you can object\r\nlittle but that they square not with you in every opinion concerning\r\nmatters of religion.\" To no modern Liberal can his principles be dearer\r\nthan was his religion to Cromwell, and the great champion of liberty's\r\nwords ought to be laid to heart by each one of us.\r\n\r\nWith all toleration, there must be no lack of courage. It is not asked\r\nof most to make sacrifices in the Liberal cause, far less to become\r\nmartyrs in its behalf; but unless the martyr-spirit remains to the\r\nparty, ready for action should occasion arise, Liberalism will wither\r\ninto wastedness. But even courage will fail of its result without\r\nconcentration, for the undisciplined mass is no match for the\r\ndisciplined army. To succeed, there must be organization; and if\r\nLiberals will not associate for common purposes they will deserve to be\r\nbeaten. All holders of progressive principles ought to attach themselves\r\nto the Liberal Association of their own constituency; if there is a\r\nRadical Club as well, they cannot do better than join it; for the more\r\nlinks that exist between all sections of the party, the stronger will be\r\nthe bond uniting them. Personal likes or dislikes ought not to affect\r\nmen in the matter. A Liberal is not worthy the name who, because he is\r\nnot asked to the house of the president of the local association,\r\ndeclines to join; and equally unworthy of it is he who, because he does\r\nnot ask the president of the Radical Club to his own house, objects to\r\nput up for membership. Personal and social considerations of this kind\r\nare out of place in politics, and a man's freedom from them may almost\r\nbe taken as a test of the reality of his Liberalism.\r\n\r\nThere are many ready to criticize those who do a party's work, but who\r\nnever lift a finger to assist their efforts. These are the beings who,\r\nat election times, hinder the helpers by carpings, who are never slow to\r\nassume a share of credit in case of victory, and are ever eager to throw\r\nthe blame upon others in event of defeat. Battles are not won by such as\r\nthese. Every Liberal to whom his principles are dear should show it by\r\njoining with his fellows, striving his hardest in his own constituency,\r\nand never ceasing to display in his life and by his works that\r\nLiberalism to him is not a name but a principle, increasingly dear as it\r\nis hampered by desertion, threatened with danger, or in peril of defeat.\r\nIf he did that, there would be needed no further answer to the question,\r\n\"How is the Liberal Programme to be attained?\" for what was required\r\nwould have been accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX.--IS PERFECTION IN POLITICS POSSIBLE?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes asked whether, after all the struggling of public life,\r\nperfection in politics is possible. But in what department of human\r\naffairs _is_ perfection possible? Is it in medicine? Mark the proportion\r\nof those born who die before they are five years old. Is it in science?\r\nThe scientist is still engaged, as Newton was, in picking up shells on\r\nthe shore of a vast ocean of knowledge which he is unable yet to\r\nnavigate. Is it in religion? Ask the Christian and the Confucian, the\r\nMahommedan and the Buddhist to define the word, before giving an answer.\r\nWhen medicine, and science, and religion have reached universally\r\nacknowledged perfection, politics may be hoped to follow in their wake;\r\nbut until that period it is needless to expect it.\r\n\r\nThe very idea that it is possible has been the cause of many delusions,\r\nand delusions are dangerous. Read Plato's \"Republic,\" More's \"Utopia,\"\r\nand Harington's \"Oceana,\" and you will perceive how far the ideal is\r\nremoved from any conceivable real. It may be that from these works good\r\nhas flowed, since the evident impossibility of making the whole plan of\r\nuse has not prevented political thinkers taking from them such ideas as\r\nwere practicable, and grafting these upon existing institutions, with\r\nbenefit to the State. But the dreamy schemes of the eighteenth century,\r\nthe influence of which has not yet died away, were of a different order.\r\nFor, in the endeavour to change society at a stroke, blunders were made\r\nwhich have caused lasting injury; and these should teach us that the\r\ntrue ideal in politics is that which does not attempt to bend men, or\r\nbreak them if necessary, to suit the machine, but makes the machine to\r\nfit the men. The philosopher is a useful personage, but the attempt to\r\nrule men from a library customarily results in disaster. The problem of\r\nlife cannot be solved like a proposition in Euclid; there, squares\r\nalways are squares and circles never anything else; but in every-day\r\nexistence the square is often forced to be circular by the rubbing off\r\nof the angles. And too often it will be found that the philosopher,\r\nbecause of his lack of practical acquaintance with his fellow men,\r\nexaggerates both what he knows and what he does: he blows a bubble and\r\ncalls it the globe; lighting a candle, he thinks it the sun.\r\n\r\nAll history teaches that the road to heaven does not lie through Acts of\r\nParliament, and that under the best laws the saints would not be many\r\nand the sinners would be far from few. No more pernicious nonsense is\r\ntalked than that all our social misery, crime, and degradation is due to\r\nbad laws. The political student cannot doubt that much misery may be\r\nmitigated, crime prevented, and degradation made impossible by good\r\nlaws, and it is that knowledge which should stimulate every Liberal to\r\nlose no opportunity of improving the conditions under which we live. But\r\nit is to display an ignorance of human nature that is really lamentable,\r\nor a desire to flatter human weakness that is beneath contempt, to tell\r\nthe people that, if only certain changes were made in the constitution\r\nof the State or of society, all would be well, none would suffer, and\r\ncrime and poverty would be known only as traditions of the past.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to assert the old theological dogma that, left to\r\nhimself, man is irredeemably bad, in order to believe that a great many\r\nbearing the name are very far from good. There is, unhappily, hardly a\r\nfamily in the country that has not one black sheep--or, at the best, one\r\nspeckled specimen--to deplore. Do we not all know the idle worthless son\r\nof good and hard-working parents, a curse to his own and to all with\r\nwhom he comes in contact? The laws affecting him are the same as those\r\nwhich affect his brothers: they prosper, he fails. Why? Because they\r\nare worthy, he is worthless; and there is no conceivable state of\r\nsociety in which he could be, or ought to be, served as well as they.\r\nCertainly there are bad men who flourish, and good who wither away; but\r\nthe political system which should prevent the possibility of this has\r\nnot yet been invented--and never will be.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is one of the most dangerous of political delusions to\r\nbelieve that any possible reform can make all men prosperous and\r\ncontented. It is just as likely as that this would be brought about by\r\nthe universal practice of the old distich--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Early to bed and early to rise\r\n     Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,\r\n\r\n\r\nas if chimney sweeps, milkmen, and market gardeners had a monopoly of\r\nthose excellent qualities. The possession of an ideal is a good thing,\r\nas long as it is not allowed to overshadow the real; and those whose\r\nideal causes them to ignore the indolence and vice of their fellows are\r\nblind guides who would lead us into a ditch.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while perfection in politics will never be realized, and the\r\nbelief that it can be is fraught with danger, it should be urged upon\r\nall to think out the possibilities of the future, and to have a\r\npolitical ideal at which to aim. Mine is a State in which all men shall\r\nbe equal before the law, every one have a fair chance according to his\r\nvirtues, his talents, and his industry, and none be advanced because of\r\nhereditary or legalized privilege. A State in which all men are free,\r\nand wherein there is a fair field and no favour, is that for which\r\nLiberals should strive. Even when it is secured we shall still have with\r\nus the idle and the vicious, for those specimens of humanity will never\r\nperish from out the land; but the workful and the sober-minded will have\r\na better chance of success than they have to-day, and the State will be\r\nbenefited thereby.\r\n\r\nExtension of individual liberty, abolition of inherited or other\r\nprivilege--those points really sum up the Liberal ideal. If it be said\r\nthat it does not promise to fill the people's stomachs, it must be\r\nreplied that stomach-filling is not the special concern of political\r\nlife. That is a matter for the people to accomplish; let us remove every\r\nlegalized hindrance to their doing it by their own capacities, but when\r\nwe have done that they must do the stomach-filling for themselves. The\r\nState may and does feed the unfortunate, but, if it is to feed the idle,\r\nit will have to make the idle work for their food. There is no necessity\r\neither in law or in morals to tax those who work for the advantage of\r\nthose who do not; and the most perfect State will be that in which the\r\nlazy and worthless will be made to labour, and the toilers be protected\r\nfrom being by them despoiled.\r\n\r\nWhat we ask is equality of opportunity, and we have much to do before\r\nthat can be obtained. There are some who say that they do not believe in\r\nelevating the working classes, because it would leave the ground floor\r\nof the social edifice untenanted. But the tenants are tired of being on\r\nthe ground, and wish to see how the upper story justifies its existence,\r\nand in that they are right. With equality of opportunity, many to whom\r\nwe are now called upon by convention to bow will sink to their proper\r\nlevel, while the men who work by brain or hands will acquire their\r\nrightful position in the social state. But without the fullest political\r\nliberty, this will never be attained, and we must strive jointly for\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nThe political ideal at which we should aim is embraced in the words of\r\nLincoln--\"that government of the people, by the people, for the people,\r\nshall not perish from the earth,\" and to that may be added that equality\r\nof opportunity shall be conceded to each one of us. Let us gain this,\r\nand as perfect a State as imperfect human nature can design or deserve\r\nwill be ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL.--WHERE SHALL WE STOP?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the late Lord Shaftesbury was in the House of Commons, and was\r\nengaged in the apparently endless task of attempting to reform the\r\nfactory laws, he brought in a bill to regulate the labour of children in\r\ncalico-print works. He had already done much, but he wished to do more,\r\nand on being asked by his opponents, \"Where will you stop?\" he replied,\r\n\"Nowhere, so long as any portion of this gigantic evil remains to be\r\nremedied.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit may be answered the question sometimes asked as to\r\nwhere Liberals will be prepared to stay the reforming hand. A period\r\ncannot be put to progress any more than a limit to literature, or to\r\nscience a stopping-place. True, we have got rid of the greater\r\ntyrannies: divine right of kings, personal rule, borough-mongering--all\r\nare dead. We have got rid of the greater inequalities: purchase in the\r\narmy, nomination in the civil service, have gone the way of the separate\r\nform at school, the distinctive tuft at the University, for the sons of\r\npeers. We have got rid of the old Tory idea that the people have nothing\r\nto do with the laws except to obey them; we now possess household, we\r\nmay soon possess adult, suffrage. But are we, therefore, to do no more?\r\nBecause we travel faster than our fathers, do we frown upon all\r\nimprovements in locomotion? Because we no longer suffer from the Plague,\r\nthe Sweating Sickness, and the Black Death, do the doctors sit with\r\nfolded arms? No; for the motto of the race is progress, and until every\r\ntyranny, every iniquity, and every inequality which trouble us in\r\npublic life are vanquished, we cannot in our conscience cease from\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nRemember always the saying of Turgot, the great French economist, \"It is\r\nnot error which opposes the progress of truth: it is indolence,\r\nobstinacy, the spirit of routine, everything that favours inaction.\"\r\nMuch that hinders our advance comes from forgetfulness of what\r\nLiberalism has done, and what, therefore, it is still capable of doing.\r\nA politician once remarked, \"Suppose that for but a month after the\r\npassing of any great measure of reform, such as the repeal of the Corn\r\nLaws, the extension of the suffrage, or the establishment of a national\r\nsystem of education, only the Liberals could have gained the benefit and\r\nthe Tories been left outside, wouldn't the Tories have joined us in a\r\nhurry to help reap the advantage the Liberals had secured?\" There is no\r\ndoubt as to the answer; but even as the sun shines upon the unjust as\r\nwell as upon the just, so the beneficent stream of Liberal legislation\r\nfertilizes the waste lands of Toryism equally with the possessions of\r\nthose who have prepared its course.\r\n\r\nYet it is this forgetfulness against which we have mainly to contend.\r\nThe age in which we live is so distinguished for progressive sentiment,\r\nso noteworthy for the number and the magnitude of its reforms, that even\r\nLiberals are occasionally in danger of letting slip some of the good\r\neffects which struggle has won by nodding contentedly at the strides\r\nthat have been taken, heedless of the enemy ever anxious to push back\r\nthe shadow on the dial. Fortunately for the preservation of our\r\nliberties, the drowsiness is seldom allowed to glide into sleep, for an\r\nawakening is furnished by the premature shouts of triumph of those whose\r\nhighest interest would be to remain silent, for it is only thus that\r\nsuccess to them is possible.\r\n\r\nBut while in the calm of supposed security, while, for instance,\r\nenjoying the belief that the Crown, as a governing power, is now in\r\nEngland non-existent, we are suddenly aroused by the argument that the\r\npossible feelings of the Sovereign with regard to a probable Irish\r\nMinistry are to be considered in antagonism to Home Rule; while we are\r\nindulging the hope that Free Trade rests upon as firm a basis as\r\nparliamentary government, we see the Conservative party coquetting with\r\nProtection; while we regard equality before the law as practically\r\nadmitted by all, we have constantly brought to our notice the belief of\r\nthe county magistrate that that which done by his son would be food for\r\nlaughter, done by his hind deserves hard labour; while sunning ourselves\r\nwith the thought that religious liberty has been absolutely secured, we\r\nhave witnessed a member of Parliament, thrice elected by a free\r\nconstituency, thrice rejected by the House of Commons, and even thrown\r\nby the police from its doors, upon theological grounds and theological\r\ngrounds alone; and while imagining that freedom of speech, of action,\r\nand of the press was beyond challenge even by the Tories, men in London\r\nhave been wounded and imprisoned for asserting the right of public\r\nmeeting, and many sent to gaol in Ireland for doing that which in\r\nEngland, Wales, and Scotland would be as perfectly legal as it was\r\nperfectly right: when we see such things we are brought to recognize\r\nthat our liberties, after all, hang by a thread.\r\n\r\nIt is well, however, that we should have these rude awakenings in order\r\nto teach us that Toryism is not dead, that it is as ready as ever to\r\nseize every opportunity for depriving the people of their liberty, to\r\nrivet the yoke of ascendency upon their shoulders, and to subvert that\r\nfreedom which only slowly and by prolonged struggle has been wrested\r\nfrom the great. The adherents of proscription and privilege do not in\r\nthese days talk of the divine right of kings--though even that doctrine\r\npeeps out when they have occasion to flatter a monarch or an\r\nheir-apparent; but the equally false doctrine of the divine right of\r\nParliaments is persistently put forward, and with the audacious pretence\r\nthat to dispute it is treason to the democracy. We are told that a House\r\nof Commons once chosen can do as it likes for seven years, and no one\r\ndare say it \"nay;\" that its majority may break the pledges upon which it\r\nwas elected, may practise coercion where it promised conciliation, may\r\ndeprive us of every single liberty it was returned to support and\r\nextend, and that it is the duty of every good subject to sit with folded\r\narms, to quietly submit to be despoiled of his rights, and to wait with\r\npatience until such time as the Prime Minister is sufficiently gracious\r\nto permit a dissolution, or the Septennial Act closes the Parliament's\r\nlife. The doctrine is fatal to liberty, disguise it by what pretence of\r\nlove for the democracy its upholders may. And is the danger which lurks\r\nbeneath it imaginary? Read the promises upon which the present majority\r\nin the House of Commons obtained its power; study the fashion in which\r\nthese have been broken; and then consider whether a denial of the divine\r\nright of Parliaments is, as the Tories contend, treason to the\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nLiberalism, at all events, will have neither act nor part in any denial\r\nof popular rights; rather it will be ever on the move towards a fuller\r\nextension of them. When it is said that the Tories of to-day are to be\r\ntrusted because they go farther than the Liberals of twenty years ago,\r\nit can be fairly replied, \"Even if true (which, if the spirit of things\r\nbe examined, is doubtful), what does it prove? Words change their\r\nmeaning as the world grows older; what yesterday was revolution is\r\nto-day reform, and to-morrow will be called reaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Onward, and ever onward,\" must be the motto of the Liberal party. As\r\nthe conditions change, so must our institutions be changed to fit them.\r\nIt cannot be too strongly repeated that in these days we have so much of\r\nliberty, compared with our forefathers, that some of us are tempted to\r\nfold our hands, to rest, and to be thankful, and to lose by sloth that\r\nwhich has been gained by struggle. The tendency to think that we possess\r\nall the freedom that the heart of man can desire is one that may act\r\nupon us as the wish for repose does upon those toiling through the\r\nsnowdrifts, and, in the guise of slumber, may bring death. The heights\r\nof liberty are not yet scaled; much remains to be done before perfect\r\nfreedom is attained. Let each be able to say with Erskine, \"I shall\r\nnever cease to struggle in support of liberty. In no situation will I\r\ndesert the cause. I was born a free man, and I will never die a slave.\"\r\n\r\nThe very reason of a Liberal's existence is that, if there is an abuse\r\nin Church or State which argument and agitation can remove, all honest\r\nendeavours shall be made to remove it. Many abuses have been abolished\r\nby these means, but many remain, and it is at the extinction of these\r\nthat Liberals should aim. Let them not lose themselves in fruitless\r\nlonging after a perfect State; let them use their best endeavours to\r\nmake the State we possess as perfect as is possible. In all things let\r\nthem aim at the practical, and let them remember that compromise is not\r\nnecessarily cowardly, and that minor differences should count for little\r\nwhen great ends are to be achieved.\r\n\r\nThe task I allotted myself has now been accomplished. Something has been\r\ntold of the beneficent results of Liberalism, but with the qualification\r\nthat Macaulay added to his description of what has been effected by the\r\nBaconian system--\"These are but a part of its fruits, and of its\r\nfirst-fruits; for it is a philosophy which never rests, by which\r\nfinality is never attained, which is never perfect. Its law is progress.\r\nA point which yesterday was invisible is its goal to-day, and will be\r\nits starting-point to-morrow.\" The future also has been attempted to be\r\nsketched--how imperfectly no one knows better than the author. But as\r\nclearly and concisely as was possible have been stated the principles\r\nand the aims of the Liberal party. It is to that party that modern\r\nEngland owes its liberties, and it is to that party alone that it can\r\nlook for their preservation and extension. Clouds may overshadow its\r\nimmediate future, old friends may drop away, the enemy may be pressing\r\nat the gate, but Liberalism will live, will thrive, and will make the\r\nhearts of our descendants glad that there are those who remain faithful\r\nto it to-day in the midst of dangers and discouragements, which cause\r\nsinking of heart only to the faint of spirit, and doubt only to the weak\r\nof soul. Resolved to broaden and strengthen the bounds of freedom, we\r\nwho continue attached to the principles of our party will never swerve\r\nfrom the straight course, will never be daunted by the virulence or the\r\nviolence of our opponents, will never forget to strive for that ideal of\r\nLiberalism--liberty of thought, equality of opportunity, and fraternity\r\nof aim.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNWIN BROTHERS, THE GRESHAM PRESS, CHILWORTH AND LONDON.",
