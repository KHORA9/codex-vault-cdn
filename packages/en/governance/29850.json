This picture will endure as\r\nundisputed history for all time.\r\n\r\nLet us concede that the newspaper writer sometimes, in the passion of\r\nthe hour, goes far afield. It is equally true that no statement of\r\nimportance can thus be made that is not immediately challenged,\r\nanswered and reanswered until, through the fierce fires of controversy\r\nthe dross is burned away and the gold of established fact remains. Not\r\nalone the fact stands out, but also the world's immediate reaction to\r\nthat fact, the psychology of the event and the man dominating the cause\r\nand the effect.\r\n\r\nThe modern newspaper is the proving ground of history. To illustrate\r\nlet us suppose that our newspaper press, as we know it today, had\r\nexisted in Shakespeare's time. Would there now be any controversy over\r\nthe authorship of the world's greatest dramas?\r\n\r\nCould the staff photographer of a Sunday supplement as efficient as one\r\nof our present day corps have snapped Mohammed in his tent and a keen\r\nreporter of today's type questioned him as to his facts and data, would\r\nnot all of us now be Mohammedans or Mohammed be forgot? Had such\r\nnewspapers as ours followed Washington to Valley Forge and gone with\r\nhim to meet Cornwallis, would the father of his country be most\r\nintimately remembered through the cherry tree episode? Consider the\r\nenlightenment which would have been thrown upon the pages of history\r\nhad a corps of modern newspaper correspondents reported the meeting of\r\nJohn and the Barons at Runnymede or accompanied Columbus on his voyages\r\nof discovery.\r\n\r\nWould not even Lincoln be more vivid in our minds and what we really\r\nknow of him not so shrouded in anecdote and story?\r\n\r\nIn Washington's time America became a Nation. In Lincoln's time our\r\ncountry was united and made one. In Wilson's time our Nation received\r\nrecognition as the greatest of the world powers. It remained, however,\r\nfor Wilson alone to reach the highest pinnacle of international\r\nprominence in the face of the pitiless cross fires of today's newspaper\r\npress. Yet this inquisition, often more than cruel, was not without its\r\nconstructive value, for it has searched out every fact and established\r\nevery truth beyond the successful attack of any future denial.\r\n\r\nThis little volume--the first perhaps of its kind concerning any man or\r\nevent--presents with no further word of its compilers a summary of\r\nWoodrow Wilson's Administration and Achievements--eight years of the\r\nworld's greatest history--taken entirely from the newspaper press.\r\n\r\nIt contains not one statement that has not been accurately weighed in\r\nthe critical scales of controversy. Its object is simply to present the\r\ntruth and have this truth early in the field so that the political\r\ncanard which was so shamelessly indulged in during the close of the\r\nWilson Administration may not be crystalized in the public mind and\r\ncloud for a time the glorious luster of his name.\r\n\r\nIt shall be as Maximilian Harden, the keenest thinker of the defeated\r\nGermans said: \"Only one conqueror's work will endure--Wilson's\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\nFRANK B. LORD and OPEN COVENANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _James Wm. Bryan_\r\n               March 5, 1916: Portrait of Mr. Wilson drawn in charcoal\r\n               by Miss Hattie E. Burdett, and considered by many as the\r\n               President's best likeness at the entrance of America\r\n               into the World War]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Woodrow Wilson's Administration_\r\n\r\n_Eight Years of the World's Greatest History_\r\n\r\n\r\nWoodrow Wilson took the oath of office as President on March 4, 1913,\r\nafter one of the most sweeping triumphs ever known in Presidential\r\nelections. Factional war in the Republican Party had given him 435\r\nelectoral votes in the preceding November, to Roosevelt's 88 and Taft's\r\n8; and though he was a \"minority President,\" he had had a popular\r\nplurality of more than 2,000,000 over Roosevelt and nearly 3,000,000\r\nover Taft.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the party which was coming back into control of the\r\nGovernment after sixteen years of wandering in the wilderness had a\r\nmajority of five in the Senate and held more than two-thirds of the\r\nseats in the lower house. With the opposition divided into two wings,\r\nwhich hated each other at the moment more than they hated the\r\nDemocrats, the party seemed to have a fairly clear field for the\r\nenactment of those sweeping reforms which large elements of the public\r\nhad been demanding for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nWith this liberalism, which was not disturbed at being called\r\nradicalism, Mr. Wilson in his public career had been consistently\r\nidentified. During his long service as a university professor and\r\nPresident he had been brought to the attention of a steadily growing\r\npublic by his books and speeches on American political problems, in\r\nwhich he had spoken the thoughts which in those years were in the minds\r\nof millions of Americans on the need for reforms to lessen those\r\ncontacts between great business interests and the Government which had\r\nexisted, now weaker and now stronger, ever since the days of Mark\r\nHanna.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of Mr. Wilson as to governmental reform, to be sure, went\r\nfurther than those of many of his followers, and took a different\r\ndirection from the equally radical notions of others. An avowed admirer\r\nof the system of government which gives to the Cabinet the direction of\r\nlegislation and makes it responsible to the Legislature and the people\r\nfor its policies, he had been writing for years on the desirability of\r\nintroducing some of the elements of that system into the somewhat rigid\r\nframework of the American Government, and in his brief experience in\r\npolitics had put into practice his theory that the Executive, even\r\nunder American constitutional forms, not only could but should be the\r\nactive director of the policy of the dominant party in legislation as\r\nwell. But a public addicted to hero worship, little concerned with\r\nquestions of governmental machinery, and inclined to believe that\r\ncertain parts of the work of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 had\r\nbeen accomplished under divine inspiration, had comparatively little\r\ninterest in the Wilson concepts of reform in political methods. They\r\nregarded him, in the language of those days, as a champion of the\r\n\"plain people\" against \"the interests.\" They had seen in his long\r\nstruggle with antagonistic influences in Princeton University--a\r\nstruggle from which he retired defeated, but made famous and prepared\r\nfor wider fields by the publicity which he had won by the conflict--a\r\nsort of miniature representation of this antithesis between the people\r\nand big business and they had learned to regard Mr. Wilson as a fighter\r\nfor democratic principles against aristocratic tendencies and the money\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThis reputation he had vastly expanded during his two years as Governor\r\nof New Jersey. His term had been distinguished not only by the passage\r\nof a number of reform measures consonant with the liberal ideas of the\r\nperiod, but by a spectacular struggle between the Governor and an\r\nold-time machine of his own party--the very machine which had nominated\r\nhim. In this fight, as in his conflict at Princeton, he had been for a\r\ntime defeated, but here again the fight itself had made him famous and\r\nwon him a hundred supporters outside of his own State for every one he\r\nlost at home.\r\n\r\nAt the very outset of his term, he had entered, against all precedent,\r\ninto the fight in the Legislature over a Senatorial election. Demanding\r\nthat the Legislature keep faith with the people, who in a preferential\r\nprimary had designated a candidate for United States Senator who did\r\nnot command the support of the organization, he had won his fight on\r\nthis particular issue and set himself before the public as a sort of\r\ntribune of the people who conceived it his duty to interpose his\r\ninfluence wherever other officials showed a tendency to disregard the\r\npopular will.\r\n\r\nIn the legislative fight for the enactment of reform legislation, too,\r\nthe Governor had continually intervened in the character of \"lobbyist\r\nfor the people,\" and while the opposition of the old political\r\norganization, which he had aroused in the fight for the Senatorship,\r\nhad partially halted the progress of this program, the great triumph in\r\nNovember, 1912, had returned a Legislature so strong in support of the\r\nGovernor that before he left Trenton for Washington practically all of\r\nthe measures included in his scheme had become laws. Mr. Wilson, then,\r\nwas known to the country not only as a reformer but as a successful\r\nreformer; and his victories over the professional politicians of the\r\nold school had removed most of the latent fear of the ineffectuality of\r\na scholar in politics. In point of fact, the chief interest of this\r\nparticular scholar had always lain in politics, and it was partly\r\nchance and partly economic determinism that had diverted him in early\r\nlife from the practice of politics to the teaching of its principles\r\nand history.\r\n\r\nAbroad, where his election was received with general satisfaction, he\r\nwas still regarded as the scholar in politics, for a Europe always\r\ninclined to exaggerate the turpitude of professional politicians in\r\nAmerica liked to see in him the first fruits of them that slept, the\r\npioneer of the better classes of American society coming at last into\r\npolitics to clean up the wreckage made by ward bosses and financial\r\ninterests. Scarcely any American President ever took office amid so\r\nmuch approbation from the leading organs of European opinion.\r\n\r\nHis radicalism caused no great concern abroad and was regarded with\r\napprehension only in limited circles at home--and even here the\r\napprehension was more over the return to power of the Democratic Party\r\nthan on account of specific fears based on the character of the\r\nPresident-elect. The business depression of 1913 and 1914 would\r\nprobably have been inevitable upon the inauguration of any Democratic\r\nPresident, particularly one pledged to the carrying out of extensive\r\nalterations in the commercial system of the country. For in 1912 Wilson\r\nhad been in effect the middle-of-the-road candidate, the conservative\r\nliberal. Most of the wild men had followed Roosevelt, and the most\r\nconservative business circles felt at least some relief that there had\r\nbeen no re-entry into the White House of the Rough Rider, with a gift\r\nfor stinging phrases and a cohort of followers in which the lunatic\r\nfringe was disproportionately large and unusually ragged.\r\n\r\nSo Woodrow Wilson entered the Presidential office under conditions\r\nwhich in some respects were exceptionally favorable. His situation was\r\nin reality, however, considerably less satisfactory than it seemed. To\r\nbegin with, he was, in spite of everything, a minority President and\r\nthe representative of a minority party. He had even, during a good part\r\nof the Baltimore Convention, been a minority candidate for the\r\nnomination. If the two wings of the Republicans should during the\r\nensuing Administration succeed in burying their differences and coming\r\ntogether once more, the odds were in favor of their success in 1916.\r\nMoreover, the Democrats were definitely expected to do something.\r\nDissatisfaction with the general influence of financial interests in\r\npublic life, a dissatisfaction which had gradually concentrated on the\r\nprotective tariff as the chief weapon of those interests, had been\r\ngrowing for years past. In 1908 a public aroused by Roosevelt but\r\nafraid of Bryan had decided to trust the Republican Party to undo its\r\nown work, and the answer of the party had been the Payne-Aldrich\r\ntariff. That tariff broke the Republican Party in two and paved the way\r\nfor the return of Roosevelt; it had also, in 1910, given the Democrats\r\nthe control of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nNow, at last the Democrats had full control of both Legislature and\r\nExecutive, and the country expected them to do something: unreasonably,\r\nit was at the same time rather afraid that they would do something. To\r\ndo something but not too much, to meet the popular demands without\r\ndestroying the economic well-being which the Republican ascendency had\r\nundoubtedly promoted, to insure a better distribution of wealth without\r\ncrippling the production of wealth--this was the problem of a President\r\nwho had had only two years in public life, and most of whose assistants\r\nwould have to be chosen from men almost without executive experience.\r\n\r\nThe chief peculiarity of President Wilson's political position lay in a\r\ntheory of American Government which had first come to him in his\r\nundergraduate days at Princeton and which had been steadily developing\r\never since. That theory, briefly, was that the American Constitution\r\npermitted, and the practical development of American politics should\r\nhave compelled, the President to act not only as Chief of State but as\r\nPremier--as the active head of the majority party, personally\r\nresponsible to the people for the execution of the program of\r\nlegislation laid down in that party's platform. Fanciful as it had\r\nseemed when first put forward by him many years before, that concept of\r\nthe Presidency was now, perhaps for the first time, within the reach of\r\npractical realization.\r\n\r\nDissatisfaction with the general secrecy and irresponsibility of\r\nCongressional committees which had charge of the direction of\r\nlegislation, in so far as there was any direction, had been growing for\r\nyears; and an incident of the revolt against the Payne-Aldrich tariff\r\nand the break in the Republican Party had been the internal revolution\r\nin the House of Representatives, taking away from the Speaker the power\r\nof controlling legislation which he had for some time enjoyed, and\r\nwhich would have been a serious obstacle to Presidential leadership\r\nsuch as Wilson had in mind. Moreover, the activity of Cleveland and\r\nRoosevelt had shown the public that even in time of peace an energetic\r\nPresident had a much wider field of action than most Presidents had\r\nattempted to cover, and the more recent example of Taft had increased\r\nthe demand for a President who would act, would not leave action to\r\nthose men around him who \"knew exactly what they wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Early Accomplishments of Administration_\r\n\r\n    _Underwood-Simmons tariff, establishing the lowest average of\r\n    duties in seventy-five years, enacted October 3, 1913._\r\n\r\n    _Federal Reserve act, organizing the banking system and stabilizing\r\n    the currency, December 23, 1913._\r\n\r\n    _Clayton Anti-Trust law._\r\n\r\n    _Creation of Federal Trade Commission._\r\n\r\n    _Repeal of Panama Canal tolls exemption._\r\n\r\n    _End of dollar diplomacy._\r\n\r\n    _Negotiation of a treaty (never ratified) with Colombia to satisfy\r\n    the Colombian claim in Panama._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were, however, two great obstacles to the operation of Mr.\r\nWilson's theory. The first was constitutional. In Europe the Premier\r\nwho directs the legislative policy of the Government is answerable not\r\nonly in Parliament but to the people whenever his policy has ceased, or\r\nseems to have ceased, to command public confidence. The President of\r\nthe United States finishes out his term, no matter how bad his\r\nrelations with Congress or how general his unpopularity among the\r\npeople. The check upon his leadership, as Mr. Wilson presently\r\nrealized, could come only at the end of his term, when the President as\r\na candidate for re-election came before the public for approval or\r\nrejection. So, even before his first inauguration, Mr. Wilson had\r\nwritten to A. Mitchell Palmer, then a Congressman, expressing\r\ndisapproval, quite aside from any personal connection with the issue,\r\nof the proposal to restrict the President to a single term. That had\r\nbeen a plank in the Democratic platform of the year before; already it\r\nwas apparent that this phase of the party's program would have to be\r\nsacrificed in order to make the party leader responsible in the true\r\nsense for the program as a whole. But that plank had not been seriously\r\nintended, and by 1916 the march of events had made it a dead letter.\r\n\r\nA more serious difficulty, in March, 1913, lay in the fact that the\r\nPresident was not the party leader. There was an enormous amount of\r\nWilson sentiment over the country, and there were many enthusiastic\r\nWilson men; but a good many of these were of the old mugwump type, or\r\nmen who had hitherto held aloof from politics. In 1912, as later in\r\n1917 and 1918, there was seen the anomaly of a leader who was himself\r\nan orthodox and often narrow partisan, yet drew most of his support\r\nfrom independent elements or even from the less firmly organized\r\nportions of the opposition. And not only were most of the Wilson men\r\nindependents or political amateurs; a still greater stumbling block lay\r\nin the fact that very few of them had been elected to office. In the\r\ngreat Democratic landslide of 1912 the Democrats who had got on the\r\npayroll were mostly the old party wheel-horses who had been lingering\r\nin the outer darkness of opposition for sixteen years past, or more or\r\nless permanent representatives of the Solid South.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the party had a leader at that time, it was Bryan. Bryan\r\nhad played the leading part in the Baltimore Convention. If he had not\r\nexactly nominated Wilson, he had at least done more than anybody else\r\nto destroy Wilson's chief competitors. There were not enough Bryan men\r\nin the country to elect Bryan, not even enough Bryan men in the party\r\nto nominate Bryan a fourth time; but there were enough Bryan Democrats\r\nto ruin the policy of the incoming President if he did not conciliate\r\nBryan with extreme care.\r\n\r\nSo the first efforts of the new Administration had to be a compromise\r\nbetween what Wilson wanted and what Bryan would permit. This was seen\r\nfirst of all in the composition of the Cabinet, which Bryan himself\r\nheaded as Secretary of State. Josephus Daniels, who as Secretary of the\r\nNavy was to be one of the principal targets of criticism for the next\r\neight years, was also a Bryan man. Of the \"Wilson men\" of the campaign,\r\nWilliam G. McAdoo was chosen as Secretary of the Treasury, not without\r\nsome grave misgivings as to his ability, which were not subsequently\r\njustified by his conduct of the office. The rest of the Cabinet was\r\nnotable chiefly for the presence of three men from Texas, a State whose\r\nprominence reflected not only its growing importance and its fidelity\r\nto the party but also the influence of Colonel Edward Mandell House, a\r\nprivate citizen who had risen from making Governors at Austin to take a\r\nprominent part in the making of a President in 1912. At the beginning\r\nof the Administration and throughout almost all of President Wilson's\r\ntenure of office he was the President's most influential adviser, a\r\nsort of super-Minister and Ambassador in general; and his position from\r\nthe first caused a certain amount of heartburning among the politicians\r\nwho resented this prominence of an outsider who had never held office.\r\n\r\nPerhaps because many of his official aids and assistants were more or\r\nless imposed upon him, the President showed from the first a tendency\r\nto rely on personal agents and unofficial advisers. And this was to\r\nbecome more prominent as the years passed, as new issues arose of which\r\nno one would have dreamed in the Spring of 1913, issues for which the\r\nordinary machinery and practice of American Government were but little\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nFor the eight years which began on March 4, 1913, were to be wholly\r\nunlike any previous period in American history. An Administration\r\nchosen wholly in view of domestic problems was to find itself chiefly\r\nengaged with foreign relations of unexampled complexity and importance.\r\nThe passionate issues of 1912 were soon to be forgotten. Generally\r\nspeaking, the dominant questions before the American people in 1912 and\r\n1913 were about the same as in 1908, or 1904, or even earlier. But from\r\n1914 on every year brought a changed situation in which the issues of\r\nthe previous year had already been crowded out of attention by new and\r\nmore pressing problems.\r\n\r\nNo American President except Lincoln had ever been concerned with\r\nmatters of such vital importance to the nation; and not even Lincoln\r\nhad had to deal with a world so complex and so closely interrelated\r\nwith the United States. Washington, Jefferson and Madison had to guide\r\nthe country through the complications caused by a great world war; but\r\nthe nation which they led was small and obscure, concerned only in\r\nkeeping out of trouble as long as it could. The nation which Wilson\r\nruled was a powerful State whose attitude from the very first was of\r\nsupreme importance to both sides. And the issues raised by the war\r\npushed into the background questions which had seemed important in\r\n1913--and which, when the war was over, became important once more.\r\n\r\nNone of this, of course, could have been predicted on March 4, 1913. A\r\nnew man with a new method had been elected President and intrusted with\r\nthe meeting of certain pressing domestic problems. At the moment the\r\npublic was more interested in the man than in his method; and not till\r\nthe crisis had been successfully passed did popular attention\r\nconcentrate on the manner of accomplishment rather than on the things\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Problems at Home, 1913-1914_\r\n\r\nOne of the passages of President Wilson's inaugural address contained a\r\nlist of \"the things that ought to be altered,\" which included:\r\n\r\n    A tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of\r\n    the world, violates the just principles of taxation, and makes the\r\n    Government a facile instrument in the hands of private interests; a\r\n    banking and currency system based upon the necessity of the\r\n    Government to sell its bonds fifty years ago and perfectly adapted\r\n    to concentrating cash and restricting credits; an industrial system\r\n    which, take it on all sides, financial as well as administrative,\r\n    holds capital in leading strings, restricts the liberties and\r\n    limits the opportunities of labor, and exploits without renewing or\r\n    conserving the natural resources of the country; a body of\r\n    agricultural activities never yet given the efficiency of great\r\n    business undertakings or served as it should be through the\r\n    instrumentality of science taken directly to the farm, or afforded\r\n    the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs.\r\n\r\nThe items had been set down in the order of their immediate importance.\r\nFirst came the tariff, for the tariff had come to be in the minds of\r\nmany Americans a symbol of the struggle between the \"plain people\" and\r\n\"the interests.\" The Payne-Aldrich tariff, enacted by a party pledged\r\nto tariff revision, had been not only an injury but an insult, and if\r\nany American Presidential election could ever be interpreted as a\r\npopular referendum on any specific policy the election of 1912 meant\r\nthat the Payne-Aldrich tariff must be revised. At the time of the\r\nenactment of that bill Mr. Wilson had written a critical article in\r\n_The North American Review_ which expressed a widespread popular\r\nsentiment in its criticism of \"the policy of silence and secrecy\"\r\nprevalent in the committee rooms when this and other tariffs had been\r\ndrawn up and a demand for procedure in the open where the public could\r\nfind out exactly who wanted what and why. Joined with this objection to\r\nthe methods of tariff making were some observations by Mr. Wilson on\r\nthe principles of tariff revision. He saw and said that a complete\r\nreturn to a purely revenue tariff was not then possible even if\r\ndesirable, and that the immediate objective of tariff reform should be\r\nthe adjustment of rates so as to permit competition and thereby\r\nnecessitate efficiency of operation.\r\n\r\nThe ideas which in March, 1909, were merely the criticism of a college\r\nprofessor had become in March, 1913, the program of the President of\r\nthe United States, the leader of the majority party, determined to get\r\nhis program enacted into law. Congress was convened in special session\r\non April 7, and the President delivered a message on the one topic of\r\nthe tariff. Going back to the precedent of Washington and Adams, broken\r\nby Jefferson and never resumed again, he read his message in person to\r\nthe Congress as if to emphasize the intimate connection between the\r\nExecutive and legislation which was to be a feature of the new\r\nAdministration. The principle of tariff reform laid down in that bill\r\nwas a practical and not a theoretical consideration, the need of ending\r\nan industrial situation fostered by high tariffs wherein \"nothing is\r\nobliged to stand the tests of efficiency and economy in our world of\r\nbig business, but everything thrives by concerted agreement.... The\r\nobject of the tariff duties henceforth laid must be effective\r\ncompetition, the whetting of American wits by contest with the wits of\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nThe measure which Democratic leaders had already prepared for that\r\npurpose and which eventually became known as the Underwood-Simmons Act\r\nwas intended to accomplish its end only gradually. Notoriously\r\noutrageous schedules of the Payne-Aldrich Act, such as that dealing\r\nwith wool, were heavily reduced, and the general purport of the bill is\r\nperhaps expressed in the phrase of Professor Taussig, that it was \"the\r\nbeginning of a policy of much moderated protection.\" It went through\r\nthe House without much difficulty, passing on May 8, and then it struck\r\nthe Senate committee rooms, from which no tariff bill had ever emerged\r\nquite as innocent as it entered. The usual expeditionary forces of\r\nlobbyists concentrated in Washington and the Senate talked it over,\r\nwhile Summer came on and Washington grew hotter and hotter. In course\r\nof time Senators began to come to the President and tell him that it\r\nwas hopeless to get the bill through at that session and that\r\nWashington was getting pretty hot. The President replied that he knew\r\nit was hot, but that Congress would have to stay there till that bill\r\nwas passed. Already he had given the lower house something to keep it\r\nbusy while the Senate wrestled with the tariff.\r\n\r\nAs for the lobby, the President had his own method of dealing with\r\nthat. On May 26 he issued a public statement calling attention to the\r\n\"extraordinary exertions\" of lobbyists in connection with the tariff.\r\n\"The newspapers are being filled,\" he said, \"with paid advertisements\r\ncalculated to mislead not only the judgment of the public men, but also\r\nthe public opinion of the country itself. There is every evidence that\r\nmoney without limit is being spent to maintain this lobby.... It is of\r\nserious interest to the country that the people at large should have no\r\nlobby and be voiceless in these matters, while the great bodies of\r\nastute men seek to create an artificial opinion and to overcome the\r\ninterests of the public for their private profit.\" The outraged dignity\r\nof Senators and Representatives, not to mention lobbyists, rose to\r\nprotest against this declaration. A Republican Senator even declared\r\nthat the President, who had been actively urging his views on\r\nlegislators just as he had done in New Jersey, was himself the chief\r\nlobbyist in connection with the Tariff Bill. A Senate Committee was\r\nappointed to find out if there had been any lobbying, and discovered\r\nthat there had. Meanwhile the bill was being argued out in the Senate,\r\nand the President stood firm against any substantial modification. It\r\nwas finally passed on Oct. 3.\r\n\r\nIt was a vindication of the platform promise and a fulfillment of the\r\nduty with which the party had been charged in the last election, and it\r\nwas a notable triumph for the personal policy of the President-Premier,\r\nwho more than anybody else had literally forced the bill through\r\nCongress. The tariff had taken such a prominent place in the fight\r\nagainst business influence in the Government that the passage of a bill\r\nwhich made a material reduction in rates was a moral victory for\r\nprogressivism at large, and for President Wilson in particular.\r\n\r\nThe actual effect of the tariff, or rather the actual effect that it\r\nmight have had, is something impossible to estimate at this time.\r\nBefore it had been in operation a year, before the country had had a\r\nchance to study the new conditions brought in by the legislation of the\r\nfirst year of the Wilson Administration, the war broke out in Europe.\r\nThe conditions which had prevailed through half a century of tariff\r\nmaking had ceased to exist. They have not yet returned. A subsidiary\r\nfeature of the Underwood-Simmons Act, however, was to attain enormous\r\nimportance in the course of the Wilson Administrations. To supply the\r\ndeficiency in revenue which the lowered duties might be expected to\r\nproduce there was added an income tax law, which had recently been\r\npermitted by constitutional amendment. Even the light duties of the\r\nfirst year, with their $3,000 exemption, were denounced by\r\nconservatives as a rich man's tax; but within four years more the\r\nexemption was to be lowered to $1,000, and the peak of the tax raised\r\nto tenfold its original height.\r\n\r\nSo long as the Wilson Administration was reducing the tariff, it was\r\ncarrying out the traditional policy of the Democratic Party; but the\r\nnext task which the President laid before Congress was much more\r\ndelicate and much more important. As the event showed, the result was\r\nto be of infinitely greater benefit to the nation. Reform of the\r\ncurrency had long been an evident necessity, and the panic of 1907 had\r\nrecently called attention to the dangers of the system based on\r\nemergency measures of the Civil War period. Mr. Wilson himself had said\r\nmuch of the necessity of freeing business from unnatural restrictions,\r\namong which the makeshift currency system was included. During the\r\nprevious Administration Senator Aldrich's plan for a centralized\r\nreserve bank had been widely discussed, and innumerable modifications\r\nhad been suggested. Democratic leaders were already working on plans\r\nfor currency reform when the new Administration came in, and on June 26\r\na bill was introduced in the House by Carter Glass and in the Senate by\r\nRobert L. Owen.\r\n\r\nIt took six months of hard work to get this adopted, but it was a\r\nmarvelous achievement to get it adopted at all. For a large faction of\r\nthe Democratic Party, including its most influential leader, still\r\nrepresented the old hostility to the \"money power,\" which regarded the\r\noverthrow of the United States Bank as the great triumph of the\r\nAmerican Democracy. The Glass-Owen bill differed from Senator Aldrich's\r\nscheme largely in the direction of decentralization and giving more\r\ncontrol to the Government and less to the banks, but, even so, it was a\r\nsuspicious document to those numerous Democrats whose economic ideas\r\nwere obtained from the Greenback and Populist Parties of former years.\r\nAnd it was not satisfactory to the majority of the articulate bankers\r\nof the country, who wanted a central bank instead of the regional\r\ndivision of the reserve functions, and who thought that the banks\r\nshould have a good deal to say about appointments to the Federal\r\nReserve Board.\r\n\r\nAs late as the beginning of December there were still three separate\r\nbills before Congress, but the party organization under the\r\nPresident-Premier held together, and on December 23 the Glass-Owen\r\nBill, with some modifications acquired en route, was signed by the\r\nPresident. The pressure on the White House during that struggle was\r\nperhaps the hardest which President Wilson encountered during his\r\nentire eight years. Many an honest Democrat thought the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the party were being betrayed, and many a Senator or\r\nRepresentative who regarded the reserve banks with profound alarm felt,\r\nnevertheless, that if the iniquitous things were going to be\r\nestablished there ought to be one in his home town. When Paul M.\r\nWarburg, a Wall Street banker, was appointed as one of the members of\r\nthe Federal Reserve Board, there were more protests from politicians\r\nwho professed to believe that the nation was being delivered over to\r\nthe money power, while the complaints of bankers who thought that the\r\nbanks were being given over to politicians had not yet died down. But\r\nwhen the act once went into operation criticism almost disappeared; and\r\nin the course of a few months the unprecedented financial strain\r\nattendant on the outbreak of the European war made it plain to almost\r\nanybody that without this timely reform of the banking system 1914\r\nwould have seen a disaster far worse than that of 1907.\r\n\r\nThe work of \"striking the shackles off business\" was continued in 1914\r\nby the introduction of bills to carry out the President's\r\nrecommendations for prohibiting interlocking directorates, clarifying\r\nthe anti-trust laws, establishing an Interstate Trade Commission, and\r\nsupervising the issue of railroad securities. The chief results of this\r\ndiscussion were the creation of the Trade Commission, a body of which\r\nmuch more was expected at the time than it has accomplished, and the\r\npassage of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act, which exempted farmers'\r\ncombinations and labor unions from the anti-trust laws, and wrote into\r\nthe statutes the declaration that labor is not a commodity. The La\r\nFollette Seamen's Bill, drawn by Andrew Furuseth of the Seamen's Union,\r\nwas introduced in 1913 and not enacted until much later. Its friends\r\ndeclared that it would at least establish decent living conditions for\r\nsailors, and its opponents, including nearly all the shipping\r\ninterests, asserted that, so long as foreign ship owners were not under\r\nsimilar restrictions, the bill would ruin the American Merchant Marine.\r\nOf the actual workings of this law there has really been no fair test,\r\nas conditions which arose during the war unsettled the entire shipping\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe domestic program of the first year and a half of the Wilson\r\nAdministration comprised, then a long-needed and immeasurably valuable\r\nreform of the banking and currency system, a revised tariff, which was\r\nat least a technical victory for Democratic principles, and a number of\r\nminor measures which seem less important in retrospect than they did at\r\nthe time. The program neither completely unshackled business nor opened\r\nthe door to a new era of coöperation and human brotherhood, but it was\r\na large and on the whole decidedly creditable accomplishment, and it\r\nwas above all the work of President Wilson, who had led the fight that\r\ncarried the Administration measures through Congress, quite as any\r\nPrime Minister might have done. He had not done it without exposing\r\nhimself to severe criticism. Ex-Senator Winthrop Murray Crane, for\r\nexample, declared that he had \"virtually obliterated Congress.\" But he\r\nhad got most of what he wanted, and by the end of his first year in\r\noffice Mr. Bryan was no longer the most powerful individual in the\r\nDemocratic Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foreign Policies, 1913-1914_\r\n\r\nIn _The North American Review_ for March, 1913, edited by Colonel\r\nGeorge Harvey, the original Wilson man, who had mentioned Wilson as a\r\nPresidential possibility back in 1904, when such a suggestion was\r\nregarded as only a playful eccentricity, who had begun to work hard for\r\nhim in 1911, and who had finally been asked by Wilson himself to give\r\nup his activity because the connection of one of Harvey's magazines\r\nwith J. P. Morgan & Co. was hurting Wilson in the West--there appeared\r\nan article entitled \"Jefferson--Wilson: A Record and a Forecast.\" It\r\nconsisted of eight pages of quotations from Wilson's \"History of the\r\nAmerican People,\" dealing with the beginning of Jefferson's\r\nAdministration. The reader's attention was arrested by the startling\r\nparallel between the division in the Federalist Party and the quarrel\r\nbetween Hamilton and Adams that facilitated Jefferson's election, and\r\nthe situation which led to Wilson's victory in November, 1912. Wilson,\r\nwriting a dozen years before the fight between Taft and Roosevelt, had\r\nunconsciously drawn a parallel closer perhaps than the facts warranted;\r\nand the reader who had been attracted by this similarity read on into\r\nWilson's characterization of Jefferson an introduction to the\r\nachievements of his Administration with a growing hope--if he happened\r\nto be a Wilson man--that after as before election Wilson's record would\r\nduplicate Jefferson's.\r\n\r\nColonel Harvey was as good a prophet in 1913 as in 1904. Wilson's\r\nachievement in domestic affairs in the first year of his Administration\r\nwas not likely to suffer much by comparison with Jefferson's. But it\r\ncould not have crossed anybody's mind in March, 1913, that\r\ncomplications of international politics such as had almost ruined the\r\ncountry under Jefferson would in the latter part of Wilson's first term\r\nexpose him to as much criticism as Jefferson, and for the same reasons.\r\n\r\nAmerica was still new as a world power, but was beginning to feel more\r\nat home. In Taft's Administration, with Philander C. Knox as Secretary\r\nof State, there had been for the first time the beginnings of what\r\nmight fairly be called a consistent foreign policy. True, it was not a\r\nvery lofty policy, nor was it by any means generally approved in\r\nAmerica. It was called by its friends \"dollar diplomacy,\" meaning the\r\npromotion of American commercial interests by diplomatic agencies. It\r\nhad been exemplified principally in Central America, where its\r\noperations had not always commanded admiration, and in China, where\r\nKnox had made a well-intentioned but not very skillful effort to\r\nprevent the absorption of Manchuria by Russia and Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Landmarks in Wilson's Mexican Policy_\r\n\r\n    _Program for armistice and elections to end civil war, August,\r\n    1913._\r\n\r\n    _\"Watchful waiting,\" 1913-14._\r\n\r\n    _Capture of Vera Cruz, April 21, 1914._\r\n\r\n    _A B C mediation, April 25, 1914._\r\n\r\n    _Flight of Huerta, July, 1914._\r\n\r\n    _Recognition of Carranza, September, 1915._\r\n\r\n    _Villa's raid on Columbus and Pershing's expedition into Mexico,\r\n    March, 1916._\r\n\r\n    _Flight and death of Carranza, May, 1920._\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever primitive this organization of foreign policy, none the less\r\nTaft and Knox had taken a great step forward in the improvement of\r\nAmerican diplomatic machinery. The diplomatic service and the State\r\nDepartment were beginning to be regarded as two parts of the same\r\nagency, and for the first time diplomacy had begun to be a career with\r\npossibilities. The practice of promoting able young secretaries to\r\nchiefs of legation, begun by Roosevelt, had been widely extended by\r\nTaft; and though the highest posts were still filled by wealthy\r\namateurs it seemed that at last the American diplomatic service offered\r\nsome attraction to an ambitious man. It was the general expectation in\r\nEurope and still more in America that President Wilson, who by training\r\nand inclination might be expected to approve of the elevation of\r\nstandards in the diplomatic service, would continue and extend this\r\nwork. Instead of that, he undid it, or rather permitted it to be\r\nundone.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan had of necessity been made Secretary of State, and it may be\r\nsupposed that there was equal necessity for opening up the diplomatic\r\nservice as a happy hunting ground for the Bryan men--\"deserving\r\nDemocrats,\" as Mr. Bryan called them in a famous letter. The chief\r\nEuropean posts, to which the Taft Administration had not begun to apply\r\nthe merit system, were filled chiefly by Mr. Wilson's own nominees.\r\nThese included several well-known men of letters, and with one or\r\ntwo exceptions the amateur diplomats serving as the heads of the\r\nmissions in Europe did satisfactory and even brilliant service\r\nunder the unprecedented strain which the war brought on them. The\r\nservice in Latin America, however, which Knox had almost entirely\r\nprofessionalized, was given over bodily to personal followers of Bryan.\r\nIn what was in 1913 perhaps the most important of our diplomatic posts,\r\nthe embassy to Mexico, Mr. Wilson was compelled to rely provisionally\r\non Henry Lane Wilson, a holdover appointee from the previous\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nIt was soon made clear that there was to be no more dollar diplomacy.\r\nThe Knox policies in Central America were dropped--although American\r\ntroops continued to dominate Nicaragua--and in 1914 the Administration\r\nsuccessfully discouraged American participation in a six-power loan to\r\nChina. The Russo-Japanese absorption of Manchuria was to be treated as\r\nthe accomplished fact that it was; and in general the policy of the new\r\nAdministration was anything but aggressive. It would not use diplomacy\r\nto advance American commercial interests, nor was it prepared to accept\r\nthe assistance of American financiers in promoting the policies of\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\nBut it was evident from the outset that the most quiescent foreign\r\npolicy could not prevent foreign complications. Growing anti-Japanese\r\nsentiment in California led to the passage of a State law against\r\nJapanese land holdings. There was much resentment in Japan, and protest\r\nwas made to the Federal Government. Mr. Bryan, as Secretary of State,\r\nhad to make a personal trip to Sacramento to intercede with the\r\nCalifornians; and at one time (May, 1913) military men appeared to feel\r\nthat the situation was extremely delicate. But the crisis passed over,\r\nthe Californians modified the law, and though in its amended form it\r\nsuited neither the Californians nor the Japanese, the issue remained in\r\nthe background during the more urgent years of the war. Toward the very\r\nend of the Wilson Administration it was to come back into prominence.\r\n\r\nAnother question which caused much disturbance to the new\r\nAdministration was the question of Panama Canal tolls. An act passed in\r\n1912 had exempted American coastwise shipping passing through the canal\r\nfrom the tolls assessed on other vessels, and the British Government\r\nhad protested against this on the ground that it violated the\r\nHay-Pauncefote treaty of 1901, which had stipulated that the canal\r\nshould be open to the vessels of all nations \"on terms of entire\r\nequality.\" Other nations than England had an interest in this question,\r\nand there was a suspicion that some of them were even more keenly if\r\nnot more heavily interested; but England took the initiative and the\r\nstruggle to save the exemption was turned, in the United States, into a\r\ndemonstration by the Irish, Germans and other anti-British elements.\r\nInnate hostility to England, the coastwise shipping interests, formed\r\nthe backbone of the opposition to any repeal of this exemption, but the\r\nTaft Administration had held that the exemption did not conflict with\r\nthe treaty (on the ground that the words \"all nations\" meant all\r\nnations except the United States), and British opposition to the\r\nfortification of the canal, as well as the attitude of a section of the\r\nBritish press during the Canadian elections of 1911, had created a\r\ndistrust of British motives which was heightened by the conviction of\r\nmany that the Hay-Pauncefote treaty had been a bad bargain.\r\n\r\nIt was understood early in President Wilson's Administration that he\r\nbelieved the exemption was in violation of the treaty, but not until\r\nOctober did he make formal announcement that he intended to ask\r\nCongress to repeal it. The question did not come into the foreground,\r\nhowever, until March 5, 1914, when the President addressed this request\r\nto Congress in ominous language, which to this day remains unexplained.\r\n\"No communication I addressed to Congress,\" he said, \"has carried with\r\nit more grave and far-reaching implications to the interests of the\r\ncountry.\" After expressing his belief that the law as it stood violated\r\nthe treaty and should be repealed as a point of honor, he continued: \"I\r\nask this of you in support of the foreign policy of the Administration.\r\nI shall not know how to deal with other matters of even greater\r\ndelicacy and nearer consequence if you do not grant it to me in\r\nungrudging measure.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been most plausibly suggested that this obscure language had\r\nreference to the Mexican situation, which a few weeks later was to lead\r\nto the occupation of Vera Cruz. The European powers were known to be\r\nmuch displeased at the continuing disturbances in Mexico and the\r\nAmerican policy of \"watchful waiting,\" and the belief has been\r\nexpressed that repeal of the exemption was a step to get British\r\nsupport for continued forbearance with Mexico. Other critics have seen\r\na reference to the unsettled issues with Japan and a fear that England\r\nmight give more aggressive support to her ally if the tolls question\r\nwere left unsettled. The attempt of a writer of biography to maintain\r\nthat even in March, 1914, the President and Colonel House foresaw the\r\nEuropean war and wanted to arrange our own international relations by\r\nway of precaution has been generally received with polite skepticism.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the President's intervention in the question, against the\r\nadvice of his most trusted political counselors, brought down on him a\r\nshower of personal abuse from Irish organs and from the group of\r\nnewspapers which presently were to appear as the chief supporters of\r\nGermany. The arguments against the repeal were unusually bitter, and\r\neven though Elihu Root took his stand beside the President and against\r\nthe recent Republican Administration, partisan criticism seized upon\r\nthe opening. Nevertheless the tolls exemption was repealed in June, and\r\nevents of July and August gave a certain satisfaction to those who had\r\nstood for the sanctity of treaties.\r\n\r\nAs a part of what might be called the general deflation of overseas\r\nentanglements, the new Administration brought about a material change\r\nin the treatment of the Philippines. From the beginning great changes\r\nwere made in the personnel of the Philippines Commission and of the\r\nAdministration of the country. Many American officials were replaced by\r\nFilipinos, but the separatist agitation in the islands was not much\r\nallayed by the extension of self-government. In October, 1914, the\r\nJones Bill, which practically promised independence \"as soon as a\r\nstable government shall have been established,\" was passed by the House\r\nof Representatives, but Republican opposition was strengthened by those\r\nwho remembered Bryan's anti-imperialism in 1900 and by the supporters\r\nof a strong policy in the Pacific. This issue, like others of the early\r\nperiod, came back into greater prominence in the last years of the\r\nsecond Wilson Administration, when war issues were temporarily disposed\r\nof.\r\n\r\nA specially conciliatory policy toward Latin America was one of the\r\nchief characteristics of the early period of the Administration. At the\r\nSouthern Commercial Congress in Mobile, on October 27, 1913, the\r\nPresident declared that \"the United States will never seek one\r\nadditional foot of territory by conquest;\" a statement which was\r\nunderstood in direct relation to the demand for intervention in Mexico,\r\nand which had a very considerable effect on public sentiment in Central\r\nand South America. The passing of \"dollar diplomacy,\" too, was\r\ngenerally satisfactory to Latin America, and, though Mr. Bryan's\r\ninexperienced diplomats made a good many blunders and could not help,\r\nas a rule, being compared unfavorably with the professionals who had\r\nheld the Latin-American posts in the previous Administration, the\r\ngeneral policy of Wilson created much more confidence in the other two\r\nAmericas than did the spasmodic aggressiveness of Roosevelt or the\r\ncommercialized diplomacy of Taft.\r\n\r\nOne specific attempt was made to heal a sore spot left by Roosevelt in\r\nrelations with Latin America by the new Administration. Negotiations\r\nwith Colombia to clear up the strained situation left by the revolution\r\nin Panama had been under way in the Taft Administration, but had come\r\nto nothing. Under Wilson they were resumed, and on April 7, 1914, a\r\ntreaty was signed by which the United States was to pay to Colombia a\r\ncompensation of $25,000,000 for Colombian interests in the Isthmus. The\r\ntreaty further contained a declaration that the Government of the\r\nUnited States expressed its \"sincere regret for anything that may have\r\nhappened to disturb the relations\" between the two countries, and this\r\nsuggestion of an apology for Roosevelt's action in 1903 roused the\r\nviolent hostility of Republicans and Progressives. The opposition was\r\nso strong that in spite of repeated efforts the Administration could\r\nnever get the treaty ratified by the Senate; but the undoubtedly\r\nsincere efforts of the Executive had of themselves a considerable\r\neffect in mollifying the suspicions of Latin America.\r\n\r\nBut all problems south of the Isthmus were insignificant compared with\r\nthe difficulties in Mexico which had begun with the Madero Revolution\r\nagainst Diaz in 1910. Just at the close of the Taft Administration\r\nMadero had been overthrown and killed by Huerta, who then ruled in\r\nMexico City and was recognized by England and Germany in the Spring of\r\n1913. Villa and Carranza were in arms against Huerta in the north,\r\ncalling themselves the champions of the Constitution; Orozoco and\r\nZapata were in arms against everybody in the south; foreign life and\r\nproperty were unsafe everywhere except in the largest cities. The\r\ndemand for intervention, which had been strong ever since the troubles\r\nbegan, was increasing in 1913. Huerta professed to be holding office\r\nonly until a peaceful election could determine the will of the nation,\r\nbut the date of that peaceful election had to be constantly put off.\r\nThe embargo on shipments of arms from the United States still existed,\r\npreventing Huerta from supplying his troops; but there was a good deal\r\nof smuggling to the revolutionary armies in the north. Of the\r\ninterventionists some wanted intervention against Huerta and some\r\nwanted intervention for Huerta; and the pressure of economic interests\r\nin Mexico was complicating all phases of the situation.\r\n\r\nFrom the first President Wilson had expressed his disapproval of the\r\nmethods by which Huerta had attained office. Ambassador Wilson, on the\r\nother hand, thought that Huerta ought to be supported, and when his\r\npolicy did not commend itself to the President he resigned in August,\r\n1913. But already the President had been getting information about\r\nMexico from extra-official sources. His first envoy was William Bayard\r\nHale, author of one of his campaign biographies. Ambassador Wilson was\r\nvirtually replaced in August by another special representative, John\r\nLind, who carried to Huerta the proposals of President Wilson for\r\nsolution of the Mexican problem. They included a definite armistice, a\r\ngeneral election in which Huerta should not be a candidate, and the\r\nagreement of all parties to obey the Government chosen by this\r\nelection, which would be recognized by the United States. Huerta\r\nrefused and presently dissolved Congress. When the elections were\r\nfinally held on October 2 Huerta won, and there was no doubt that he\r\nwould have won no matter how the voting had happened to go.\r\n\r\nThe President's program for Mexican reform, it may be said, was not as\r\nevidently impracticable in 1913 as it seems in retrospect. It was\r\nwidely criticised at the time, and the phrase \"watchful waiting\" which\r\nhe invented as a description of his Mexican Policy was made the object\r\nof much ridicule. Throughout the first winter of the new Administration\r\nthe American Government was apparently waiting for something to happen\r\nto Huerta or for Huerta to reform, and President Wilson several times\r\nsharply criticised the actions of the Mexican dictator. But Huerta did\r\nnot reform and nothing sufficient happened to him; it began to look as\r\nif watchful waiting might continue indefinitely when a trivial incident\r\nfurnished the last straw.\r\n\r\nA boatload of American sailors from the warships anchored off Tampico\r\nto protect American citizens had been arrested by the Mexican military\r\nauthorities. They were released, with apologies, but Admiral Mayo\r\ndemanded a salute to the American flag by way of additional amends, and\r\nwhen Huerta showed a disposition to argue the matter the Atlantic Fleet\r\nwas (April 14, 1914) ordered to Mexican waters. A week later, as\r\nnegotiations had failed to produce the salute, the President asked\r\nCongress to give him authority to use the armed forces of the United\r\nStates \"against Victoriano Huerta.\" There was much criticism of the\r\npolicy which had endured serious material injuries for more than a year\r\nto threaten force at last because of a technical point of honor, and\r\nbesides those who did not want war at all the President found himself\r\nopposed by many Congressmen who thought that the personal attack on\r\nHuerta was rather undignified, and that the President should have asked\r\nfor a downright declaration of war.\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was debating the resolution the American naval forces\r\n(on April 21) seized the Vera Cruz Custom House to prevent the landing\r\nof a munition cargo from a German ship. This led to sharp fighting and\r\nthe occupation of the entire city. General Funston with a division of\r\nregulars was sent to relieve the naval landing parties; and war seemed\r\ninevitable. Even the Mexican revolutionaries showed a tendency to\r\nprefer Huerta to the intervention of the United States. But on April 25\r\nthe Governments of Argentina, Brazil and Chile proposed mediation,\r\nwhich Wilson and Huerta promptly accepted. A conference met at Niagara\r\nFalls, Ontario, and through May and June endeavored to reach a\r\nsettlement not only between the United States and Mexico, but between\r\nthe various Mexican factions. The President was still attempting to\r\ncarry out his policy of August, 1913, and the chief obstacle was not\r\nHuerta, but Carranza, who had refused to consent to an armistice and\r\nfor a long time would not send delegates to Niagara Falls. Meanwhile\r\nHuerta made one concession after another. Watchful waiting had indeed\r\nruined him; for President Wilson's opposition had made it impossible\r\nfor him to get any money in Europe--and in the early part of 1914 some\r\nEuropean nations would still have considered Mexico a good risk.\r\nMoreover, from February to April the embargo on arms had been lifted,\r\nand the Constitutionalists armies in the north, munitioned from the\r\nUnited States, were steadily conquering the country. On July 15 Huerta\r\nresigned, and soon afterward sailed for Spain; and on August 20\r\nCarranza entered Mexico City.\r\n\r\nDespite the criticism that had been heaped on the President's handling\r\nof the Tampico-Vera Cruz affair, he had got rid of Huerta without\r\ngetting into war. A still more important consequence, the full effect\r\nof which was not immediately apparent, was the enormous increase in the\r\nconfidence felt by Latin America in the good intentions of the Wilson\r\nAdministration. The acceptance of A-B-C mediation in 1914 made possible\r\nthe entry of most of the Latin-American powers into the European War in\r\n1917 as allies of the United States. And for a time it was to appear as\r\nif this had been about the only tangible profit of the episode; for\r\nCarranza presently proved almost as troublesome as Huerta. The Fall of\r\n1914 saw the outbreak of a new civil war between Villa and Carranza, in\r\nwhich Zapata, Villa's ally, for a long time held Mexico City. Obregon's\r\nvictories in 1915 drove Villa back to his old hunting grounds.\r\n\r\nBy this time the European war was occupying most of the attention of\r\nthe American people, but Mexico was a constant irritant. Carranza\r\ncarried the Presidential art of biting the hand that fed him to an\r\nundreamed-of height. Wilson, Villa and Obregon had enabled him to\r\ndisplace Huerta, and Obregon had saved him from Villa. Yet he had\r\nquarreled with Villa, he was eventually to quarrel with Obregon; and\r\nthough the United States and the chief Latin-American powers had given\r\nhim formal recognition in September, 1915, his policy toward Wilson\r\ncontinued to be blended of insult and obstruction. Henry Prather\r\nFletcher, the ablest of the diplomats accredited to Latin-American\r\ncapitals, had been called back from Santiago de Chile to represent the\r\nUnited States in Mexico; but despite his skill, despite the infinite\r\nforbearance of the Administration, Mexico sank deeper and deeper into\r\nmisery, foreign lives and property were unsafe throughout most of the\r\ncountry, and there was a continuing succession of incidents on the\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nThese were the fault of bandits, chiefly of Villa, whose repeated\r\nmurders of American citizens led to futile attempts to get satisfaction\r\nout of Carranza. The culmination of these outrages came on March 9,\r\n1916, when Villa raided across the border, surprised the garrison of\r\nColumbus, N.M., and killed some twenty Americans. A punitive expedition\r\nof regulars under General Pershing was promptly organized. It pushed\r\nabout 200 miles into Mexico, destroyed several small parties of\r\nVillistas, and wounded Villa himself. But it did not catch him nor any\r\nof his principal leaders, and in April outlying parties of Americans\r\ncame into skirmishing with Carranza forces at Parral and Carrizal. It\r\nwas evident that further advance meant war with Carranza; and indeed\r\nmuch American sentiment aroused by the capture of American soldiers by\r\nCarranzistas, demanded war already. But relations with Germany were\r\nvery acute at the moment, so Pershing dug in and held his position\r\nthroughout the Summer and Fall. In May the National Guard was ordered\r\nout to protect the border, and remained in position for months without\r\ntaking active steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _President Wilson's Appeals for Mediation_\r\n\r\n    _Formal offer of mediation to all belligerents, August 5, 1914._\r\n\r\n    _German proposal of peace conference, December 12, 1916._\r\n\r\n    _President's appeal to the belligerents to state their terms,\r\n    December 18, 1916._\r\n\r\n    _German refusal to state terms, December 26, 1916._\r\n\r\n    _Allied statement of war aims, January 11, 1917._\r\n\r\n    _President's \"peace without victory\" speech, January 22, 1917._\r\n\r\n    _Notification of unrestricted submarine war, January 31, 1917._\r\n\r\n    _Diplomatic relations with Germany broken, February 3, 1917._\r\n\r\n    _Declaration of war, April 6, 1917._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mexican policy of the Administration was one of the chief points of\r\nattack during the campaign of 1916, but the re-election of President\r\nWilson and the progress of events in Europe presently threw the issue\r\ninto the background. In February and March, 1917, when war with Germany\r\nseemed inevitable, the expeditionary force under Pershing was recalled.\r\n\r\nCarranza's pro-Germanism, or rather anti-Americanism, was hardly\r\ndisguised during the war, and the confiscatory policy of his\r\nAdministration in dealing with foreign oil and mineral properties\r\nthreatened to do much damage to American interests. When the war in\r\nEurope had ended, the question of Mexico once more came back to the\r\nforeground of attention. Carranza's Administration had not been stained\r\nby so much guilt as Huerta's, and the opposition to it was on the scale\r\nof banditry rather than revolution; but Mexico was far worse off after\r\nyears of the war than it had been in 1913, and disregard of American\r\nrights was still the cardinal policy of the Government. Carranza's\r\nsecurity, however, was illusory. In the Spring of 1920 Presidential\r\nelections were announced at last, and Carranza's attempt to force\r\nYgnacio Bonillas, his Ambassador in Washington, into the Presidential\r\nchair led to a revolt which eventually attracted the leadership of\r\nObregon. Carranza fled from Mexico City and was murdered on May 22,\r\n1920, and, after the interim Presidency of Adolfo de la Huerta, Obregon\r\ncame into office in the Fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The European War, 1914-1916_\r\n\r\nWhen in the last week of July, 1914, a war of unparalleled intensity\r\nand magnitude suddenly fell upon a world which for forty years had been\r\nenjoying unprecedented well-being and security, the practically\r\nunanimous sentiment of Americans was gratitude that we were not\r\ninvolved. The President's first steps, a formal proclamation of\r\nneutrality and equally formal tender of mediation to the belligerents,\r\n\"either now or at any other time that might be thought more suitable,\"\r\nhad general approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Federal Reserve_\r\n               We must have a currency, not rigid as now, but readily,\r\n               elastically responsive to sound credit, the expanding\r\n               and contracting credits of everyday transactions, the\r\n               normal ebb and flow of personal and corporate dealings.\r\n               Our banking laws must mobilize reserves; must not permit\r\n               the concentration anywhere in a few hands of the\r\n               monetary resources of the country or their use for\r\n               speculative purposes in such volume as to hinder or\r\n               impede or stand in the way of other more legitimate,\r\n               more fruitful uses.--_From the President's Address to\r\n               Congress, April 23, 1913._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Courtesy New York Times_\r\n               July 3, 1912: Governor Wilson receiving congratulations\r\n               from newspaper correspondents on his nomination for the\r\n               Presidency]\r\n\r\nBut a sharp division of sentiment showed itself when, on August 18, he\r\nissued an address to the American people warning against partisan\r\nsympathies and asking that Americans be \"impartial in thought as well\r\nas in action,\" in order that the country might be \"neutral in fact as\r\nwell as in name.\" The great majority of the American people, or of such\r\npart of it as held opinions on public questions, had already made up\r\ntheir minds about the war, and most of the others were in process of\r\nbeing convinced. Some of them had made up their minds from racial\r\nsympathies, but others had thought things out. And among these last,\r\nparticularly, there was a revolt against the assumption that in the\r\npresence of such issues any impartiality of thought was possible.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the world-wide extent of the war, and the closer\r\ninter-relations of nations which had grown up in recent years, made\r\nalmost from the first a series of conflicts between the interests of\r\nthe United States and those of one or the other set of belligerents.\r\nPreservation of neutrality against continual petty infractions was\r\nhard, and was rendered harder by the active sympathy felt for the\r\ndifferent belligerents by many Americans. A further complication came\r\nfrom the growing feeling that America's military and naval forces were\r\nfar from adequate for protection in a world where war was after all\r\npossible. The Autumn of 1914 saw the beginning for better national\r\npreparedness, and counter to that the rise of organized\r\npeace-at-any-price sentiment which from the first drew much support\r\nfrom pro-German circles.\r\n\r\nThe President appeared to incline toward the pacifists. He called the\r\ndiscussion of preparedness \"good mental exercise,\" and referred to some\r\nof its advocates as \"nervous and excitable,\" and in the message to\r\nCongress in December, 1914, he took the position that American\r\narmaments were quite sufficient for American needs. In this it was\r\napparent that he was opposed by a large part of the American people;\r\nhow large no one could yet say. But the Congressional elections of 1914\r\nhad conveyed a warning to the Democrats. They were left with a majority\r\nin both houses, but the huge preponderance obtained in 1912 had\r\ndisappeared. And the reason was even more alarming than the fact; the\r\nProgressive Party almost faded off the map in the election of 1914.\r\nMost of the voters who had been Republicans before the Chicago\r\nConvention of 1912 were Republicans once again. Of the Progressive\r\nParty, there was nothing much left but the leaders, and many of these\r\nwere obviously thinking of going back to the old home.\r\n\r\nThe Government had already had occasion to protest against British\r\ninterference with allied commerce when, on February 4, 1915, the\r\nGermans proclaimed the waters about the British Isles a war zone open\r\nto submarine activities. The President promptly warned the German\r\nGovernment that it would be held to \"strict accountability\" if American\r\nships were sunk or American lives lost in the submarine campaign. Along\r\nwith this a message was sent to the British Government protesting\r\nagainst British restriction of neutral commerce. There was good ground\r\nfor objection to the practices of both Governments, and the\r\nsimultaneous protests emphasized the neutral attitude of the United\r\nStates. Not until later was it evident that to the Germans this policy\r\nseemed to indicate the possibility of putting pressure on England\r\nthrough America.\r\n\r\n\"Strict accountability\" seemed to be a popular watchword, except among\r\npacifists and German sympathizers, but Americans soon began to be\r\nkilled by the submarines without provoking the Government to action.\r\nWhen the Lusitania was sunk on May 7, 1915, and more than a hundred of\r\nthe 1,200 victims were Americans a great part of the nation which had\r\nbeen growing steadily more exasperated felt that now the issue must be\r\nfaced. The President was the personal conductor of the foreign policy\r\nof the Administration; Mr. Bryan's sole interest in foreign affairs\r\nseemed to be the conclusion of a large number of polite and valueless\r\ntreaties of arbitration, and it was certain that with Germany, as with\r\nMexico, the President would deal in person. In the few days after the\r\nsinking of the Lusitania the nation waited confidently for the\r\nPresident's leadership, and public sentiment was perhaps more nearly\r\nunanimous than it had been for eight months past, or was to be again\r\nfor two years more.\r\n\r\nThe President's note on May 13 met with general approval. It denied any\r\njustification for such acts as the sinking of the Lusitania, and warned\r\nthe Germans that the Government of the United States would not \"omit\r\nany word or act\" to defend the rights of its citizens. But some of the\r\neffect of that declaration had already been destroyed by a speech the\r\nPresident had made two days before, in which he had said that \"there is\r\nsuch a thing as a man being too proud to fight,\" and the Germans, it\r\nwas learned presently, had been still further reassured by a\r\ndeclaration of Mr. Bryan (entirely on his own authority) to the\r\nAustrian Ambassador that the note was intended only for home\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the note was not followed by action. Throughout the whole\r\nSummer the President maintained a correspondence with the Germans,\r\ndistinguished by patient reasoning on his part and continual shiftings\r\nand equivocations on theirs. Meanwhile nothing was done; the public\r\nsentiment of the first days after the Lusitania had been sunk had\r\nslackened; division and dissension had returned and redoubled. Pacifism\r\nwas more active than ever and German agents were spreading propaganda\r\nand setting fire and explosives to munition plants. Mr. Bryan, who\r\napparently alone in the country was fearful that the President might\r\nneedlessly involve the nation in war, resigned as Secretary of State on\r\nJune 8. Aside from a certain relief, the public almost ignored his\r\npassing; the man who had been the strongest leader of the party in\r\nMarch, 1913, had in the last two years sunk almost into obscurity.\r\nAttention was now concentrated on the policy which the President, whose\r\nnew Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, was hardly more than a\r\nfigurehead, was pursuing toward Germany.\r\n\r\nIn August two more American passengers were drowned in the sinking of\r\nthe liner Arabic, and in other submarine exploits of the Summer a\r\nnumber of American seamen lost their lives. The President's persistence\r\nat last had the effect of getting from the Germans, on September 1, a\r\npromise to sink no more passenger boats, and on October 5 they made a\r\nformal expression of regret for the Arabic incident. Meanwhile some of\r\nthe acts of sabotage against American industries had been traced back\r\nto the Austro-Hungarian Embassy, and the Ambassador, Dr. Dumba, was\r\nsent home in September. A few months later Papen and Boy-Ed, the\r\nMilitary and Naval Attachés of the German Embassy, followed him for a\r\nsimilar reason.\r\n\r\nBut the German outrages continued, and so did the submarine sinkings,\r\nthough these were now transferred to the Mediterranean and Austria was\r\nput forward as the guilty power. Also, nothing had been done about the\r\nLusitania. The country had apparently been divided by internal\r\ndiscords. The condition which the President had hoped to prevent by his\r\nappeal for \"impartiality in thought as well as in action\" had come\r\nabout. Also, the danger of war had revealed the inadequacy of America's\r\nmilitary establishment, and a private organization, whose moving spirit\r\nwas General Leonard Wood, had undertaken to supply the deficiencies of\r\nthe Government by establishing officers' training camps. Toward Wood\r\nand his enterprise the Government seemed cold, and he was reprimanded\r\nby the Secretary of War for permitting Colonel Roosevelt to make an\r\nindiscreet speech at the training camp at Plattsburg. But when Congress\r\nassembled in December the President deplored and denounced that new\r\nappearance in American public life, the hyphenate, and urged upon\r\nCongress that military preparation which he had derided a year before.\r\n\r\nCongress, it was soon evident, was far less convinced than the\r\nPresident that anything had happened during 1915. In December, 1915,\r\nand in January, 1916, Mr. Wilson made a speaking tour through the East\r\nand Middle West in support of his new policy. His demand for a navy\r\n\"incomparably the most adequate in the world,\" which Mr. Daniels\r\ntranslated into the biggest navy in the world, aroused some doubts in\r\nthe minds of the public as to where the Administration thought the\r\nchief danger lay, and German influences did their best during the\r\nWinter to stir up anti-British sentiment in Congress--the more easily\r\nsince the controversy over British interference with American commerce\r\nwas still unsettled.\r\n\r\nEventually, and largely as a result of the President's speaking tour,\r\nCongress adopted a huge naval program, which was destined to remain on\r\npaper for some years. Military reform, however, had a different fate.\r\nThe President had supported the policy favored by the Secretary of War,\r\nLindley M. Garrison, of supplementing the regular line by a federalized\r\n\"Continental army\" of 400,000 men. The House Committee on Military\r\nAffairs, led by James Hay, would not hear of this and insisted on\r\nFederal aid to the National Guard. The President, declaring that he\r\ncould not tell a Congressional committee that it must take his plan or\r\nnone, appeared to be ready to give in to Hay, and Garrison resigned in\r\nprotest. Hay had his way, and Garrison was succeeded by Newton D.\r\nBaker, previously regarded as inclined to the pacifist side of the\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Senator Glass on Woodrow Wilson_\r\n\r\n    _It is my considered judgment that Woodrow Wilson will take a place\r\n    in history among the very foremost of the great men who have given\r\n    direction to the fortunes of the nation. No President of the United\r\n    States, from the beginning of the Republic, ever excelled him in\r\n    essential preparation for the tasks of the office. By a thorough\r\n    acquisition of abstract knowledge, by clear and convincing precept\r\n    and by a firm and diligent practical application of the outstanding\r\n    principles of statecraft, no occupant of the Executive chair up to\r\n    his advent was better furnished for a notable administration of\r\n    public affairs. And Wilson's Administration has been notable. Its\r\n    achievements, in enumeration and importance, have never been\r\n    surpassed; and it may accurately be said that most of the things\r\n    accomplished were of the President's own initiative._\r\n\r\n    _Of the President's personal traits and characteristics I cannot as\r\n    confidently speak as those persons whose constant and intimate\r\n    association with him has given them observation of his moods and\r\n    habits. To me he always has been the soul of courtesy and\r\n    frankness. Dignified, but reasonably familiar; tenacious when sure\r\n    of his position, but not hard to persuade or to convince in a cause\r\n    having merit, I have good reason to be incredulous when I hear\r\n    persons gabble about the unwillingness of President Wilson to seek\r\n    counsel or accept advice. For a really great man who must be\r\n    measurably conscious of his own intellectual power, he has\r\n    repeatedly done both things in an astonishing degree during his\r\n    Administration; and when certain of a man's downright honesty, I\r\n    have never known anybody who could be readier to confide serious\r\n    matters implicitly to a coadjutor in the public service._\r\n\r\n                                    _CARTER GLASS_\r\n    _Written for The New York Times,_\r\n    _February 18, 1921._\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the submarine issue was still an issue. Little satisfaction\r\nhad been obtained for events in the Mediterranean, and in March the\r\nSussex, a cross-Channel passenger boat, was torpedoed in plain\r\nviolation of the German promise of September 1. There followed another\r\ninterchange of notes, but the usual German efforts to deny and evade\r\nwere somewhat more clumsy than usual. On April 19 the President came\r\nbefore Congress and announced that \"unless the Imperial Government\r\nshould now immediately declare and effect an abandonment of its present\r\nmethods of submarine warfare against passenger and freight carrying\r\nvessels\" diplomatic relations would be broken off. The threat had its\r\neffect; the Germans yielded, grudgingly and in language that aroused\r\nmuch irritation, but on the main question they yielded none the less,\r\nand promised to sink no more merchantmen without warning.\r\n\r\nDuring this crisis the President had had to contend with a serious\r\nrevolt in Congress, which took the form of the Gore Resolution in the\r\nSenate and the McLemore resolution in the House, warning American\r\ncitizens off armed merchantmen. The President took the position that\r\nthis was a surrender of American rights, and upon his insistence both\r\nresolutions were brought to a vote and defeated. The Lusitania question\r\nwas still unsettled, but on the general issue of submarine war the\r\nGermans had at last given way to the President's demand, and through\r\nmost of 1916 the submarine issue was in the background.\r\n\r\nDuring the year there was a continuation of diplomatic action against\r\nthe British Government's interference with neutral commerce and with\r\nneutral mails. But, aside from the comparative unimportance of these\r\nissues beside the submarine assassinations, the Lusitania and similar\r\nepisodes had stirred up so much indignation that not many Americans\r\nwere seriously interested in action against England which could only\r\nwork to the advantage of Germany. The year saw the institution of the\r\nShipping Board, which was to look after the interests of the American\r\nmerchant marine brought into being by the war, and also some efforts to\r\nextend American commerce in South America. Of more eventual importance\r\nfor Latin-American relations was the necessity for virtually\r\nsuperseding the Government of the Dominican Republic, which had become\r\ninvolved in civil war and financial difficulties, by an American Naval\r\nAdministration, as had been done in Haiti the year before.\r\n\r\nThe principal domestic event of the year was the threatened railroad\r\nstrike, which came at the end of the Summer. The President summoned the\r\nheads of the four railroad brotherhoods and the executives of the\r\nrailroad lines to Washington for a conference in August, and attempted\r\nwithout success to bring them to an agreement. A program to which he\r\neventually gave his approval provided for the concession by the\r\nemployers of the basic eight-hour day, with other issues left over\r\nuntil the working of this proposal could be studied. The railroad\r\nexecutives refused this, and while the negotiations were thus at a\r\ndeadlock it became known that the brotherhoods had secretly ordered a\r\nstrike beginning September 4. To avert this crisis the President asked\r\nCongress to pass a series of laws accepting the basic eight-hour day,\r\nproviding for a commission of investigation, and forbidding further\r\nstrikes pending Government inquiry.\r\n\r\nNone of these proposals except the eight-hour day, the center of the\r\nwhole dispute, met the approval of the brotherhoods, and none of them\r\nexcept the eight-hour day and the commission of investigation was\r\nadopted. But, with A. B. Garreston, of the Brotherhood of Conductors,\r\nholding a stopwatch in the gallery, Congress hastily passed these laws\r\nand the strike was called off.\r\n\r\nThe eight-hour issue was the last item on the record on which President\r\nWilson came up for re-election in the Fall of 1916. Despite the\r\nsingle-term plank in the Democratic platform of 1912, it had been\r\nevident long before the end of Mr. Wilson's first term that he was the\r\nonly possible candidate. In March, 1913, he had seemed almost like an\r\noutside expert called in for temporary service in readjusting some of\r\nthe problems of public life; he was by no means the leader of the\r\nparty. But long before Bryan resigned in alarm at the tendencies of a\r\nforeign policy over which the Secretary of State had no control the\r\nPresident had become the leader of the party, and by 1916 he was almost\r\nthe only leader of prominence.\r\n\r\nIn the record on which the electorate was to express its judgment only\r\na minor place was taken by the issues which had seemed of such\r\nimportance in 1913. The Federal Reserve Act had already proved its\r\nvalue so well that it was being taken as a matter of course, and people\r\nwere forgetting that they had ever had to depend on a currency which\r\nran for cover in every crisis and on a banking system where each bank\r\nwas a source of weakness to its neighbors instead of strength. What\r\neffect the Underwood-Simmons Tariff and other measures of the first\r\nyear might have had on American business no man could say, for\r\nconditions created by the war had left America the only great producer\r\nin a world of impatient consumers whose wants had to be met at any\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nMexico, which had provided the most pressing problem in foreign affairs\r\nduring the Taft Administration, was still an unsolved problem in 1916,\r\nand more disturbing than ever. The President had indeed avoided war\r\nwith Mexico, but had become involved in two invasions of the country\r\nand in an expensive mobilization. During the 1916 election the nation\r\nhad in Mexico most of the drawbacks of war without any of the possible\r\nbenefits. In forcing out Huerta the President had indeed won a notable\r\ndiplomatic triumph, but he had not succeeded either in winning greater\r\nsecurity for American life and property or in getting a Mexican\r\nGovernment more disposed to good relations with the United States; and\r\nthe Republicans maintained that war had been avoided only at the\r\nsacrifice of both American prestige and American interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Personal Messages to Congress_\r\n\r\n    I am very glad, indeed, to have this opportunity to address the two\r\n    Houses directly and to verify for myself the impression that the\r\n    President of the United States is a person, not a mere department\r\n    of the Government hailing Congress from some isolated island of\r\n    jealous power, sending messages, not speaking naturally and with\r\n    his own voice--that he is a human being trying to cooperate with\r\n    other human beings in a common service. After this pleasant\r\n    experience I shall feel quite normal in all our dealings with one\r\n    another.--_From the President's First Address to Congress, April\r\n    8, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _Harris & Ewing_\r\n               April 8, 1913: Mr. Wilson reading his first message to\r\n               Congress]\r\n\r\nBut Mexico, despite the emphasis placed upon it by the Republicans, was\r\na secondary issue in the campaign of 1916. The great issue was the\r\nconduct of American relations with Germany, and the ultimate Republican\r\nfailure in the election may be laid primarily to the inability of the\r\nRepublican Party to decide just where it stood on the main issue.\r\n\r\nThe President had in this field also won a diplomatic victory. Like his\r\nvictory over Huerta, it was more apparent than real, for the submarines\r\nwere still active, and even during the campaign several incidents\r\noccurred which looked very much like violations of the German promise\r\nmade in May. The most serious incident, that of the Lusitania, was\r\nstill unsettled and the opponents of the President charged him with\r\nhaving bought peace with Germany, like peace with Mexico, at the cost\r\nof national interest and honor. Still the technical victory in the\r\nsubmarine negotiations had remained with the President, and he had\r\nsucceeded in winning at least a nominal recognition of American rights\r\nwithout going into a war which, as every one realized, would be a much\r\nmore serious enterprise than an invasion of Mexico. German propaganda\r\nand terrorist outrages, which had been so serious in 1915, fell off\r\nmaterially in 1916 largely on account of the energetic work of the\r\nDepartment of Justice, which had sent some of the most prominent\r\nconspirators to jail and driven others out of the country. But a\r\nconsiderable section of the population had made up its mind that\r\nGermany was already an enemy and was dissatisfied with the President's\r\ncontinual efforts to preserve impartiality of thought as well as of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe President was renominated at the Democratic Convention in St.\r\nLouis, and the platform expressed a blanket endorsement of the\r\nachievements of his Administration. But the chief incident of that\r\nconvention was the keynote speech of Martin H. Glynn, which was based\r\non the text, \"He kept us out of war.\" His recital of the long list of\r\npast occasions in American history when foreign violations of American\r\nrights and injuries to American interests had not led to war was\r\nreceived with uproarious enthusiasm by the convention and completely\r\noverturned the plans which had been made by the Administration managers\r\nto emphasize the firmness of the President in defense of American\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nBut the Republicans presently gave that issue back to them. The party\r\npassed over Colonel Roosevelt; the memory of 1912 was still too bitter\r\nto permit the old-line leaders to accept him. On the other hand, the\r\nColonel and his following had to be conciliated, so the Republican\r\nConvention nominated Charles E. Hughes, who had viewed the party\r\nconflict of 1912 from the neutrality of the Supreme Court bench. The\r\nProgressive Party duly had its convention and nominated Roosevelt; and\r\nwhen Roosevelt announced that Hughes's views on the preservation of\r\nAmerican interests were satisfactory and that the main duty was to beat\r\nWilson, a good many Progressives followed the Colonel back into camp. A\r\nrump convention, however, nominated a Vice Presidential candidate, and\r\nvirtually went over to Wilson.\r\n\r\nJustice Hughes's views on public issues were not known before he was\r\nnominated, and on the great issue of the campaign they were never very\r\nclearly known until after the election, when it was too late. He had\r\nstrong opinions on Democratic misgovernment and maladministration and\r\noutspoken opinions on Mexico, but whenever he tried to say anything\r\nabout the war in Europe he used up most of his energy clearing his\r\nthroat. A large element in the American people, which was influential\r\nout of proportion to its numbers because it included most of the\r\nintelligent classes and most of the organs of public opinion, felt that\r\nthe President had been too weak in the face of German provocation. To\r\nthis element, chiefly in the East, Colonel Roosevelt appealed with his\r\ndenunciation of German aggression and of the President's temporizing\r\nwith Germany; but Colonel Roosevelt was not running for President.\r\nThere was another minority, considerably smaller and far less\r\nreputable, which consisted of bitter partisans of the German cause.\r\nThis minority was fiercely against the President because he had dared\r\nto challenge Germany at all; and though Mr. Hughes gave it no\r\nparticular encouragement, it supported him because there was nobody\r\nelse to support.\r\n\r\nSo, in the Eastern States, where anti-German sentiment was strongest,\r\nthe Democrats advocated the re-election of Wilson as the defender of\r\nAmerican rights against foreign aggression, while in the West he was\r\npraised as the man who had endured innumerable provocations and \"kept\r\nus out of war.\" When Hughes swept everything in the East, it was\r\nconfidently assumed on election night that Wilson had been repudiated\r\nby the country; but later reports showed that the East was no longer\r\nsymptomatic of the country's sentiment. For three days the election was\r\nin doubt. It was finally decided by California, where the Republican\r\nSenator whom Hughes had snubbed was re-elected by 300,000 majority,\r\nwhile the Democratic electoral ticket won by a narrow margin. Wilson\r\nhad carried almost everything in the West. Those parts of the country\r\nwhich lay further away from Europe and European interests had\r\nre-elected him because he had \"kept us out of War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mediation Efforts, 1916-1917_\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by Count von Bernstorff that, if Hughes had been\r\nelected, President Wilson would immediately have resigned, along with\r\nthe Vice President, after appointing Hughes as Secretary of State, in\r\norder to give the President-elect an opportunity to come into office at\r\nonce and meet the urgent problems already pressing on the Executive.\r\nWhether the President actually entertained any such intention or not,\r\nit would have been a logical development of his theory of the Chief\r\nExecutive as Premier. But the President-Premier had received a vote of\r\nconfidence, and was free to deal with the new situation created by the\r\nvarious peace proposals of the Winter of 1916-1917. The negotiations\r\nwhich followed during December and January were obscure at the time and\r\nare by no means clear even yet. The fullest account of them is that of\r\nBernstorff, whose personal interest in vindicating himself would make\r\nhim a somewhat unreliable witness even if there were nothing else\r\nagainst him. And at the time, when the President's motives were unknown\r\nto a public which had not his advantage of information as to what was\r\ngoing to happen in Europe, almost every step which he took was\r\nmisconstrued, and his occasional infelicities of language aroused\r\nsuspicions which later events have shown to be entirely unjustified.\r\n\r\nReports of American diplomats in the Fall of 1916 indicated that the\r\nparty in Germany which favored unrestricted submarine war without\r\nconsideration for neutrals was growing in strength. It was opposed by\r\nmost of the civilian officials of the Government, including the\r\nChancellor, Bethmann Hollweg; Jagow and Zimmermann, the successive\r\nForeign Secretaries, and Bernstorff, the Ambassador in Washington. But\r\nthe Admirals who supported it were gradually winning over the\r\nall-powerful Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff, and it appeared only a\r\nquestion of time until the promise to America of May, 1916, should be\r\nbroken. And, as Bernstorff has expressed it, the President realized\r\nafter the Sussex note there could be no more notes; any future German\r\naggression would have to be met by action or endured with meekness.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the President was driven to seek opportunity for\r\nthe mediation which he had been ready to offer, if asked, from the very\r\nbeginning of the war. But to offer mediation, so long as the war was\r\nundecided, was a matter of extreme delicacy. The majority of\r\nintelligent Americans were strong partisans of the allied cause and\r\nfirmly believed that that cause was bound to win in the long run. There\r\nwas a minority which had equal sympathy for Germany and equal\r\nconfidence in her ultimate success. To offer mediation while the war\r\nwas still undecided would have been to offend both of these elements,\r\nas well as the warring nations themselves, all of which were still\r\nconfident of victory. Specifically, to offer mediation during the\r\ncourse of the Presidential election would have been to drive over to\r\nHughes all the pro-Ally elements in America, which in the state of mind\r\nof 1916 would have seen in such a proposal only a helping hand extended\r\nto a Germany whose cause was otherwise hopeless.\r\n\r\nSo, though during 1916 the President would have welcomed a request for\r\nmediation, he did not dare suggest it on his own account. And neither\r\nside dared to propose it, for such a request would have been taken as\r\nan admission of defeat. Nineteen hundred and sixteen was an indecisive\r\nyear, but the fortune of war gave now one side and now the other the\r\nconviction that a few months more would bring it to complete victory.\r\nIn such circumstances the losers dared not make a proposal which would\r\nhearten their enemies and the victors would not suggest the stopping of\r\nthe war when they hoped that a few months more would see them in a much\r\nmore favorable position.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _A Sympathetic Tribute_\r\n\r\n    _Hamilton Holt, head of a delegation that visited the White House\r\n    on October 27, 1920, in connection with the campaign advocating our\r\n    entry into the League of Nations, said in the course of his address\r\n    to President Wilson:_\r\n\r\n    _\"It was you who first focused the heterogeneous and often diverse\r\n    aims of the war on the one ideal of pure Americanism, which is\r\n    democracy. It was you who suggested the basis on which peace was\r\n    negotiated. It was you, more than any man, who translated into\r\n    practical statesmanship the age-old dream of the poets, the\r\n    prophets and the philosophers by setting up a league of nations to\r\n    the end that coöperation could be substituted for competition in\r\n    international affairs._\r\n\r\n    _\"These acts of statesmanship were undoubtedly the chief factors\r\n    which brought about that victorious peace which has shorn Germany\r\n    of her power to subdue her neighbors, has compelled her to make\r\n    restitution for her crimes, has freed oppressed peoples, has\r\n    restored ravaged territories, has created new democracies in the\r\n    likeness of the United States, and above all has set up the League\r\n    of Nations.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut by December Germany's situation was more fortunate than at any time\r\nsince the early Summer. Rumania, which had come into the war three\r\nmonths before, had been defeated and overrun in a spectacular campaign\r\nwhich had brought new prestige to the German armies. The triumph was of\r\nmore value in appearance than in reality, for no decision had been\r\nreached on the main fronts and none of the chief belligerents was\r\nwilling to give up. Germany was under a terrible strain, and the\r\ncivilian Government concluded that the end of 1916 offered an\r\nopportunity to make a peace proposal, without loss of prestige, which\r\nmight lead to a settlement of the war that would leave Germany\r\nsubstantially the victor. For it was known that unless some such\r\ndecisive result were soon attained the military party would unloose the\r\nsubmarines in the effort to win a complete victory, and thereby bring\r\nabout complications too serious for the civilian officials to\r\ncontemplate with any sense of security.\r\n\r\nSo on Dec. 12 Bethmann Hollweg proposed a peace conference. He\r\nmentioned no terms which Germany would consider; he spoke in the\r\narrogant tones of a victor; and the total effect of his speech was to\r\nconvince the world that he was trying to influence the pacifist\r\nelements in the allied countries rather than to bring about an end of\r\nthe war. But his step caused profound uneasiness in Washington, for he\r\nhad anticipated the action which the President had long been\r\nconsidering. If Mr. Wilson could not have offered mediation before the\r\nelection, he might have tried it in November had not the German\r\ndeportation of Belgian workingmen just then aroused such a storm of\r\nanti-German feeling in America that it would have been unsafe to take a\r\nstep which public opinion would have generally regarded as favorable to\r\nGermany. Now that Bethmann Hollweg had anticipated him, it was evident\r\nthat any proposal which the President might make would be regarded as a\r\nsort of second to the German motion.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the situation was urgent, and the President seems to have\r\nfelt that his interposition could perhaps accomplish something which\r\nthe German initiative could not. Colonel House in the last two years\r\nhad made a number of trips to Europe as a sort of super-Ambassador to\r\nall the powers in the endeavor to find out what their Governments\r\nregarded as suitable terms of peace. Mr. Wilson's own interest lay\r\nfirst of all in the establishment of conditions that would reduce--or,\r\nas men would have said in 1916, prevent--the possibility of future\r\nwars. On May 27, 1916, he had delivered a speech before the League to\r\nEnforce Peace in which he favored the formation of an international\r\nassociation for the delay or prevention of wars and the preservation of\r\nthe freedom of the seas. Later speeches contained doctrines most of\r\nwhich were eventually written into the League covenant, and were based\r\non the central theory that all nations must act together to prevent the\r\nnext war, as otherwise they would all be drawn into it. On Oct. 26 he\r\nhad declared that \"this is the last war the United States can ever keep\r\nout of.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The United States in the War_\r\n\r\n    _Declaration of war, April 6, 1917._\r\n\r\n    _American warships in European waters, May 4, 1917._\r\n\r\n    _First Liberty Loan offered, May 14, 1917._\r\n\r\n    _Selective Service act operative, May 18, 1917._\r\n\r\n    _First American troops in France, July 1, 1917._\r\n\r\n    _Fourteen Points speech, January 8, 1918._\r\n\r\n    _\"Force to the utmost\" speech, April 6, 1918._\r\n\r\n    _Americans in action at Cantigny, May 28, 1918._\r\n\r\n    _Chateau-Thierry, June 1-5, 1918._\r\n\r\n    _Marne-Aisne offensive, July 15-August, 1918._\r\n\r\n    _St. Mihiel offensive, September 12, 1918._\r\n\r\n    _Mèuse-Argonne offensive, September 26-November 11, 1918._\r\n\r\n    _Austrian peace proposal, September 15, 1918._\r\n\r\n    _First German peace note, October 4, 1918._\r\n\r\n    _Armistice ending the war, November 11, 1918._\r\n\r\n\r\nYet the President also had ideas on the nature of the peace terms by\r\nwhich the war then going on should be concluded, though he felt that no\r\ngood could be obtained by the proposal of such terms from a neutral. On\r\nDec. 18, accordingly, he addressed the belligerent Governments with an\r\ninvitation to state the specific conditions which each of them regarded\r\nas essential to a just peace, in the hope that they would find they\r\nwere nearer agreement than they knew. Unfortunately, the President made\r\nthe observation that the objects of the two alliances, \"as stated in\r\ngeneral terms to their own people and the world,\" were \"virtually the\r\nsame.\" That was true; each side had said that it was fighting in\r\nself-defense in order to preserve international justice, the rights of\r\nnationalities, and a number of other worthy interests. But the public,\r\nboth in America and in the allied countries, saw in this renewed effort\r\nat \"impartiality of thought as well as of action\" an indication that\r\nthe President saw no moral difference between the two sides. From that\r\nmoment any good result of the President's suggestion, in America or in\r\nthe allied countries, was out of the question; and if any hope had\r\nremained, the Germans presently destroyed it. They wanted a peace\r\nconference with no terms stated beforehand, where they could play on\r\nthe divergent interests of the allied countries; nor did they want the\r\nPresident to have anything to do with the making of peace, lest, as\r\nBethmann Hollweg expressed it to Bernstorff, the Germans should be\r\n\"robbed of their gains by neutral pressure.\" So the German reply on\r\nDec. 26 politely observed that a direct conference between the\r\nbelligerents would seem most appropriate, which conference the German\r\nGovernment proposed. For the general idea of a League of Nations the\r\nGermans expressed their approval, but they wanted peace of their own\r\nkind first.\r\n\r\nThe allied reply was delayed until Jan. 11, but at least it met the\r\nPresident's request for details. It laid down the specifications of\r\nwhat the allied powers would regard as a just peace, and the bulk of\r\nthat program was eventually to be written into the Treaty of\r\nVersailles. But at the time, of course, it was evident that the\r\nbelligerents were further from agreement than they thought, or at any\r\nrate than the President thought. Of such terms Germany would hear\r\nnothing; nor would her Government give to the President, even in\r\nconfidence, its own idea of the specifications of a just peace.\r\n\r\nSo the President, determined to carry out his program in spite of all\r\nobstacles, finally went before the Senate on Jan. 22, 1917, and laid\r\ndown some general considerations of what he thought a just peace should\r\nbe like. It was the logical next step in his effort to stop the war\r\nbefore America should become involved, but it was taken under\r\nconditions which made success impossible. As a matter of fact, the\r\nGermans had already decided to resume the unrestricted submarine war;\r\nthe decision had been taken on Jan. 9, but was not to be announced till\r\nJan. 31. Moreover, in America and the allied countries public sentiment\r\nwas unprepared for anything like the speech of Jan. 22. Few people in\r\nthe United States realized the danger. Mr. Lansing had followed upon\r\nthe December note with a statement to correspondents that if the war\r\nwere not soon stopped America might be drawn into it. That was the\r\nfact, but it depended on information unknown to the public; and though\r\nthe most natural inference was that a new crisis with Germany was at\r\nhand no one knew exactly how to take it--particularly as Lansing, on\r\norders from the White House, hastened to explain that he had been\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the President was still desperately striving to keep in good\r\nunderstanding with the German Government, and in pursuance of this\r\npolicy James W. Gerard, the Ambassador to Germany, had declared at a\r\ndinner in Berlin on Jan. 6 that the relations between America and\r\nGermany had never been better than they were at that moment. This,\r\nalso, the public in the United States found it hard to understand. If\r\nLansing's reference to the danger of war had meant anything, what did\r\nthis mean?\r\n\r\nSo the President's address to the Senate on Jan. 22 did not and could\r\nnot have the reception that he hoped. He set forth his idea of the\r\nnecessity of a League of Nations, he declared that the peace must be\r\nbased on democratic principles and on the doctrine that was to become\r\nfamous before long under the name of self-determination. There must be\r\nno more forcible conquests, no more bartering of unwilling populations.\r\nThe peace that ended this war, he said, must be guaranteed by a League\r\nof Nations--of all nations; and if America was to enter that League she\r\nmust be assured that the peace was a peace worth guaranteeing.\r\n\r\nSo far every one might have followed him, in America at least; but the\r\nPresident called such a peace a \"peace without victory,\" and to the\r\nsupporters of the Allies in America, rendered suspicious by a course\r\nwhose motives they could not see, that meant a peace without allied\r\nvictory and consequently an unjust peace. Few of the President's public\r\naddresses have been more unfavorably received.\r\n\r\nWilson had stated his peace terms--of course, only in general\r\nprinciples; the Allies had stated theirs in detail. Except for an\r\narticle in a New York evening newspaper, inspired by Bernstorff but\r\nbearing no mark of authority, the German terms had not even been\r\nsuggested. On the day following his Senate speech, according to\r\nBernstorff, the President volunteered to issue a call for an immediate\r\npeace conference if only the Germans would state their terms. But they\r\ndid not state them until the 29th, when a note for the President's\r\nprivate information detailed a program which was as obviously\r\nunacceptable to the allied powers as the Allies' terms were to the\r\nGermans. In any case this program had only an academic interest, for\r\nalong with it came a formal notice that unrestricted submarine war\r\nwould begin on Feb. 1.\r\n\r\nThe German Government had deliberately broken its promises of Sept. 1,\r\n1915, and May 5, 1916. Moreover, that Government, which for months past\r\nhad been sending the President private assurances of its hearty\r\napproval of his efforts toward peace, had by its intrusion and its\r\nrefusal to deal openly wrecked those efforts when at last he had\r\nbrought them to a head. There was only one thing to do, and the\r\nPresident did it. On Feb. 3 he announced to Congress the rupture of\r\ndiplomatic relations with Germany.\r\n\r\nBut breaking of relations did not mean war. The President told Congress\r\nthat if the threat against American lives and property conveyed by the\r\nresumption of submarine war were followed by overt acts of actual\r\ninjury to Americans he would come before Congress once more and ask for\r\nauthority to take the necessary steps to protect American interests.\r\nBut for the moment he seems to have felt that only a warning was\r\nnecessary; that the Germans, if convinced that America meant business,\r\nwould reconsider their decision. And he added, \"I take it for granted\r\nthat all neutral Governments will take the same course.\" Logically they\r\nshould have done so, since the proclamation of submarine war was\r\nvirtually a declaration of war on all neutrals; but the European\r\nneutrals did not dare to run the risk even if they had been so minded.\r\n\r\nThe submarines set to work and more ships were sunk, some of them ships\r\nwith American passengers. The nation began to demand war to end an\r\nimpossible situation. For the moment the President's aspirations were\r\nmore moderate, and he asked Congress in the closing days of his first\r\nterm for authority to arm American merchant ships for defense against\r\nsubmarines. The bill readily passed the House and commanded the support\r\nof seven-eighths of the Senate; but a dozen pacifists, pro-Germans and\r\nprofessional obstructionists, whom the President denounced as \"a little\r\ngroup of willful men,\" filibustered it to death in the Senate in the\r\nlast hours of the session. Almost the first act of the President after\r\nhis inauguration, however, was the preparation to arm the ships by\r\nExecutive authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Rural Credits_\r\n\r\n    The farmers, it seems to me, have occupied hitherto a singular\r\n    position of disadvantage. They have not had the same freedom to get\r\n    credit on their real assets that others have had who were in\r\n    manufacturing and commercial enterprises, and while they sustained\r\n    our life, they did not in the same degree with some others share in\r\n    the benefits of that life.--_From President Wilson's remarks on\r\n    signing the Rural Credits Bill, July 17, 1916._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _Paul Thompson_\r\n               1918: The President acknowledging greetings at a\r\n               military review]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile secret agents had discovered an attempt by the German Foreign\r\nOffice to enlist Mexican and Japanese support in the prospective war\r\nagainst America by promising annexations in the Southwest and on the\r\nPacific Coast. Publication of this on March 1 converted a good many\r\nAmericans of the interior who had hitherto been slow to recognize the\r\nseriousness of the German danger; and as the submarine campaign\r\ncontinued and no European neutrals followed the American example, the\r\nsentiment in favor of declaration of war grew every day.\r\n\r\nBut for the President this involved considerable logical difficulty.\r\nFrom the first he had striven to maintain \"impartiality of thought,\" or\r\nat least of speech. He had said that the war was no concern of\r\nAmerica's; it would be the task of long historical research to assign\r\nthe responsibility for its outbreak; that \"with its causes and objects\r\nwe are not concerned. The obscure foundations from which its tremendous\r\nflood has burst forth we are not interested to search for and explore.\"\r\nIt was a war which should be ended by a peace without a victory.\r\nWhatever meaning the President attached to these statements when he\r\nmade them, the meaning attached to them by the public was a serious\r\nobstacle to the man who was going to have to lead the nation into war.\r\nBut he solved the dilemma by a change of base which affected the whole\r\npolitical complexion of the war thereafter, which introduced a new and\r\noverriding issue--an issue which, addressing Congress on April 2, he\r\nintroduced to the world in his most famous phrase and the most\r\neffective of his speeches. America, he said, had no quarrel with the\r\nGerman people; that people had not made the war. But the Germans were\r\nruled by an autocratic Government which had made neutrality impossible,\r\nwhich had shown itself \"the natural foe of liberty.\" That Government\r\nhad forced America to take up the sword for the freedom of peoples--of\r\nall peoples, even of the German people. America must fight \"to make the\r\nworld safe for democracy.\" On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war.\r\n\r\n\r\n_America at War, 1917-1918_\r\n\r\nOnce committed to war, the President found behind him a nation more\r\nthoroughly united than could ever have been hoped in the dark days of\r\n1915. Again, as in the week after the sinking of the Lusitania, he was\r\nthe universally trusted leader of the people; and to a considerable\r\nextent the unity of the nation at the entrance into war could be traced\r\nback to the very policies of delay which had been so sharply\r\ncriticised. The people who had been on the side of the Allies from the\r\nfirst and who had seen through German pretenses long before were now\r\nsolidly behind the President, for he had at last come over to their\r\nviews. But other and important elements which might have been hostile\r\ntwo years before were now convinced of the necessity for fighting the\r\nGermans.\r\n\r\nAnd the President's call to a crusade for democracy won the support,\r\npermanent or temporary, of many of those liberals who otherwise, in\r\nAmerica and the allied countries, were inclined during the whole war to\r\nsee in the Kaiser and Ludendorff the natural allies of liberalism.\r\nThere was a feeling of great ideas stirring the world in the Spring of\r\n1917. The Russian revolution had just overthrown the most reactionary\r\nand apparently the most firmly established of autocratic Governments,\r\nand no one in Western Europe or America doubted that Russia would jump\r\nin six months as far as England, France and America had painfully\r\ntoiled in two centuries, and become and remain a free democracy. If\r\nRussia had had a revolution, might not Germany have a revolution, too?\r\nWould not the German people, whose injuries at the hands of their own\r\nrulers the President had so well pointed out, rise up and overthrow\r\nthose rulers and bring about a just and lasting peace? Many people in\r\nthe Spring of 1917 expected exactly that; the millennium was just\r\naround the corner.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it seemed that perhaps the Allies would win the war in the\r\nfield before America could get into it. A British offensive in Artois\r\nhad important initial successes, and Nivelle's bloody failure on the\r\nAisne was for a long time represented to the world as a brilliant\r\nvictory. War, for America, might involve a little expenditure of money,\r\nbut hardly any serious effort, according to the view widely current\r\namong the population in the Spring of 1917; it was more than anything\r\nelse an opportunity for the display of commendable moral sentiments,\r\nand for enthusiastic acclamations to the famous allied leaders who\r\npresently began to come to the United States on special missions. It is\r\nhardly too much to say that most of the American people went into this\r\nwar in the triumphant mood usually reserved for the celebration of\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nIt may some day be regarded as one of the chief merits of the Wilson\r\nAdministration that it was not affected by this popular delusion. While\r\na large part of the people seemed to expect a cheap and speedy victory\r\nby some sort of white magic, the Administration was getting ready to\r\nwork for victory. And thanks largely to the unity which had been bought\r\nby the President's caution in the two previous years, Congress and the\r\npeople assented to measures of exertion and self-denial such as no man\r\ncould have expected America to undertake until compelled by bitter\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe first step was the dispatch of American naval forces to aid the\r\nAllies in the fight against the submarines, which for a few months were\r\nto come dangerously near justifying the confidence that had been placed\r\nin them. The process of naval reinforcement was slow, and not till 1918\r\ndid the American Navy become a really important factor in the\r\nanti-submarine campaign; but every destroyer added to the allied forces\r\nwas of immediate value. The American Treasury was opened for vast\r\ncredits to the Allies, who by their enormous purchases of war materials\r\nin the United States had created the abounding prosperity of 1916, and\r\nhad pretty nearly exhausted their own finances in doing so. More than\r\nthat, the Administration began at once to prepare for the organization\r\nof a vast army; and faced with this most important duty of the conduct\r\nof the war, the President took the advice of the men who knew. The army\r\nofficers knew that if America were to take a serious part in the war\r\nthe regular army and the National Guard would not be enough, nor even\r\nGarrison's Continental Army which had been rejected in 1916. A big army\r\nwould be needed, and the right way to raise it was by conscription.\r\n\r\nSo the Selective Service act was introduced in Congress and passed in\r\nMay, without very serious opposition. At the very start the American\r\npeople had accepted a principle which had been adopted in the crisis of\r\nthe Civil War only after two years of disaster and humiliation. It was\r\nthe estimate of experts that this army would need a year of training\r\nbefore it would be fit for the front line, and a huge system of\r\ncantonments was hastily constructed to house the troops, while the\r\nnucleus of men trained in the Plattsburg camps was increased by the\r\nextension of the Plattsburg system all over the country.\r\n\r\nFor the leadership of this army General Pershing was selected, not\r\nwithout considerable criticism from those who thought General Wood\r\ndeserved the position. The reasons which led to the selection of\r\nPershing are not yet officially known to the public, but Pershing's\r\nrecord was to be a sufficient justification of the appointment.\r\n\r\nBut military and naval measures were only a part of the work needed to\r\nwin this war. Allied shipping was being sunk by the submarines at an\r\nalarming rate, and new ships had to be provided. An enormous American\r\nprogram was laid out, and General Goethals, in whom there was universal\r\nconfidence, was made head of the Emergency Fleet Corporation charged\r\nwith its execution. But Goethals could not get along with William\r\nDenman, head of the Shipping Board, and changes of personnel were\r\nconstant through the year until in 1918 Charles M. Schwab was finally\r\nput in chief control of the shipbuilding program.\r\n\r\nFor this and the development of the industrial program necessary for\r\nmilitary efficiency the support of labor was essential. Mr. Wilson now\r\nreaped once more the benefit of a policy which had previously brought\r\nhim much criticism. His retreat before the railroad brotherhoods in\r\nAugust of 1916, as well as the general policy of his Administration,\r\nhad won him the invaluable support of the American Federation of Labor,\r\nand this good understanding, together with the unprecedented wage\r\nscales which came into operation in most industries with the war\r\nemergency, gave to the United States Government much more firm support\r\nfrom organized labor than most of the allied countries had been able to\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\nBut this war touched every department of human affairs. The Allies were\r\nshort of food, and one of the first achievements of the American\r\nGovernment was the institution of a limited food control in the United\r\nStates, under the directorship of Herbert Hoover. Saving of food by\r\nvoluntary effort was popularized, and increased production and reduced\r\nconsumption prevented the appearance of any serious food crisis in the\r\nallied countries. Later a fuel control was instituted under Dr. Harry\r\nA. Garfield, and the principle of voluntary self-denial established by\r\nthe Food Administration was carried on into the field of news, where\r\nthe newspapers submitted to voluntary restriction of the publication of\r\nnews that might unfavorably affect military and naval movements. The\r\nCommittee on Public Information, headed by George Creel, was in general\r\nsupervision of this work, and, though it was, on the whole, unpopular\r\nand accomplished no very useful purpose at home, it developed during\r\n1918 a service of European propaganda which was of immense value in\r\nheartening the Allies, informing the neutrals and discouraging the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nFor all this money was needed, and in May and June the first Liberty\r\nLoan of $2,000,000,000 was put before the public in an intensive\r\ncampaign of publicity. Mr. McAdoo proved himself an extremely able\r\nadvertiser of the public finances, and with the vigorous coöperation of\r\nbanks and business men the loan was more than 50 per cent\r\noversubscribed. There were other and larger loans later, but after the\r\nsuccess of the first one there was no doubt that they would be taken;\r\nthe first great accomplishment in national financing was almost as much\r\nof a surprise to the public as the ready acceptance of the draft.\r\n\r\nEarly in April the railroads were put in charge of a committee of five\r\nrailroad Presidents, who were given great powers in the combination of\r\nfacilities for better service. But the system did not work well, and on\r\nDec. 26, 1917, the President announced the assumption by the Government\r\nof control of the railroads for the war emergency, with Mr. McAdoo as\r\nDirector General.\r\n\r\nNineteen hundred and seventeen, then, saw the Wilson Administration\r\nundertaking far heavier burdens than any previous Administration had\r\nattempted, and meeting with a measure of success which was beyond all\r\nprediction. The most powerful nation in the world was getting ready for\r\nwar on an enormous scale, getting ready slowly, to be sure, but with a\r\nsurprising ease and a surprising harmony. The nation which had\r\nre-elected the President in November because he had kept it out of war\r\nwas whole-heartedly behind him from April on as he led it into war.\r\n\r\nBut great as was the President's moral authority at home, it was still\r\ngreater abroad. The principles proclaimed in his address of April 2,\r\nand repeated and elaborated later in the year, became the creed of\r\nalmost every political element in Europe except the German military\r\nparty. The Russian revolution was still a liberalizing influence, in\r\nthe early part of the year, and self-determination began to be\r\nproclaimed over all Europe as the central principle of any satisfactory\r\npeace settlement. In the allied countries, where Mr. Wilson's\r\nforbearance toward Germany had been heaped with ridicule for the last\r\ntwo years, he became over night the interpreter of the ideals for which\r\nthe democratic peoples were fighting. Hereafter in any negotiations\r\nwith Germany the President by general consent acted as the spokesman of\r\nall the allied Governments, and the peoples of the allied countries\r\naccepted his declarations as a sort of codification of the principles\r\nof the war. It must be left for the historian of the future to decide\r\nhow much of this deference was due to appreciation of the President's\r\nservice in clarifying the allied ideals, and how much to his position\r\nas head of the most powerful nation in the world, whose intervention\r\nwas expected to bring victory to the Allies.\r\n\r\nBut in other countries as well, Wilson's ideals had become a dogma to\r\nwhich everybody professed allegiance no matter what his views. The\r\nPresident's principles, as publicly expressed in his speeches, had been\r\nin effect a declaration of worthy ends, such as all right thinking\r\npersons desired. He had been less concerned with the means to those\r\nends, and consequently all who agreed with his principles were inclined\r\nto assert that the President's ideals were exemplified by their own\r\npractices. In 1917 the President enjoyed the unusual experience of\r\nseeing American liberals, British Laborites, three or four kinds of\r\nRussian Socialists, neutral Socialists, neutral clericals, neutral\r\npacifists and even certain groups in the enemy countries all\r\nproclaiming their adherence to the ideals of President Wilson.\r\n\r\nFor a time, indeed, it seemed that the war might be decided by moral\r\nforce. Beginning to take alarm at the activity of America, and not yet\r\ncertain of the effect of the Russian revolution (which was having grave\r\nconsequences in Austria-Hungary) the Germans inclined during the Summer\r\nof 1917 to a new peace offensive. Bethmann Hollweg was dropped on July\r\n14, and five days later a majority of the Reichstag voted for a peace\r\nvirtually on the basis of the status quo ante. In August the Vatican\r\nissued a peace proposal suggesting a settlement on that general\r\nprinciple, with territorial and racial disputes to be left for later\r\nadjustment; and the Socialists of Europe were preparing to meet at\r\nStockholm for a peace conference of their own influenced by the same\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nBut the President had changed his opinion that America had no concern\r\nwith the causes and the objects of the war; he had had to search for\r\nand explore the obscure foundations from which the tremendous flood had\r\nburst forth. His Flag Day speech on June 14 showed that he was now\r\nthinking of the political and economic aspects of the German drive for\r\nworld supremacy; and when the allied powers intrusted him with the task\r\nof answering the Pope's peace suggestion in the name of all of them, he\r\ndeclared that \"we cannot take the word of the present rulers of Germany\r\nas a guarantee for anything that is to endure.\" The German Government\r\ncould not be trusted with a peace without victory.\r\n\r\nThat peace offensive died out in early Fall. The Germans had lost\r\ninterest, for they seemed likely to reach their objective in other\r\nways. Things were going badly for the Allies. The offensives in the\r\nwest had broken down and France's striking power seemed exhausted.\r\nItaly suffered a terrific defeat in October. America was preparing, but\r\nhad not yet arrived, and the chief result of the Russian revolution had\r\nbeen the collapse of the eastern front. When in November the Bolsheviki\r\noverthrew Kerensky and prepared to make peace at any price, it was\r\nevident that the German armies in France would soon be enormously\r\nreinforced. So the Winter of 1917-18 saw a new peace offensive, but\r\nthis time most of the work was done by the Allies, and the object was\r\nto detach Austria-Hungary from Germany.\r\n\r\nThe item of principal interest in the long-range bombardment of\r\nspeeches on war aims by which the statesmen of the various powers\r\nconducted this exchange of views was the proclamation of the famous\r\nFourteen Points, in which the President for the first time put his\r\nideas as to the conditions of a just peace into somewhat specific form.\r\nThe origin of this program, which was eventually to become the basis of\r\nthe peace treaty, is still a matter of conjecture. Lloyd George on Jan.\r\n5, 1918, had stated war aims in some respects identical with those\r\nwhich the President embodied in the Fourteen Points three days later. A\r\ngood deal of the program had been included in the allied statement of\r\nJan. 11, 1917, but the Fourteen Points were somewhat more moderate.\r\nThey seemed to be, indeed, a rather hasty recension of old programs in\r\nthe effort to modify allied aspirations so that Austria would accept\r\nthem; for while the Fourteen Points professed to contain the scheme of\r\na just peace, they were set forth as a step in the endeavor to persuade\r\nAustria to desert her ally. As it happened, Austria could not have\r\ndeserted Germany even if she had desired; and, in any event, the effort\r\nto compromise was quite impracticable. The section referring to\r\nAustrian internal problems, for instance, proposed a solution which the\r\nAustrian Government had rejected only a few weeks before, and which the\r\nAustrian subject nationalities would no longer have been willing to\r\naccept\r\n\r\nWhatever the origin of the Fourteen Points, their immediate effect was\r\nslight. The Austrians, and to a lesser extent the Germans, professed\r\ninterest, but it was soon apparent that the Germans at least were not\r\nready to approach the allied point of view. And the Treaty of\r\nBrest-Litovsk, forced upon Russia on March 3, was in such stark\r\ncontrast with the benevolent professions of German statesmen that the\r\nPresident realized that nothing could be gained by debate and\r\ncompromise. On April 6, in a speech at Baltimore, he declared that only\r\none argument was now of use against the Germans--\"force to the utmost,\r\nforce without stint or limit.\" The process of conversion from the\r\nviewpoint of January, 1917, was complete.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, the application of force had already\r\nbegun. On March 21 Ludendorff had opened his great offensive in France\r\nwhich was to bring the war to a German victory, and for the next few\r\nmonths Foch, and not Wilson, was the dominant personality among the\r\nAllies. And for a time it seemed that however much America had\r\ncontributed to the moral struggle between the alliances, she would be\r\nable to furnish comparatively little force. The winter of 1917-18 had\r\nbeen full of humiliations. The railroad disorganization which had led\r\nto the proclamation of Government control at the end of December was\r\nbeing cleared up only slowly. The Fuel Administration was in an even\r\nworse tangle, and in January business and industry had to shut down for\r\nseveral days throughout the whole Eastern part of the country in order\r\nto find coal to move food trains to the ports. Great sums of money and\r\nenormous volumes of boasting had been expended on airplane construction\r\nwithout getting any airplanes. Hundreds of millions had been poured\r\ninto shipyards and ships were only beginning to come from the ways. The\r\nrichest nation in the world allowed hundreds of its soldiers to die in\r\ncantonment hospitals because of insufficient attention and inadequate\r\nsupplies. Artillery regiments were being trained with wooden guns and\r\nonly 150,000 Americans, many of them technical troops, were in France.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War, called before a Congressional committee to answer\r\nquestions on these shortcomings, had created the impression that he\r\neither did not know that anything was wrong or did not care. On Jan. 19\r\nSenator Chamberlain, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Military\r\nAffairs, declared that \"the military establishment of the United States\r\nhas broken down; it has almost stopped functioning,\" and that there was\r\n\"inefficiency in every bureau and department of the Government.\" The\r\nnext day he introduced bills for a War Cabinet and a Director of\r\nMunitions, which would practically have taken the military and\r\nindustrial conduct of the war out of the President's hands.\r\n\r\nThe President met the challenge boldly with the declaration that\r\nSenator Chamberlain's statement was \"an astonishing and unjustifiable\r\ndistortion of the truth,\" and must have been due to disloyalty to the\r\nAdministration. Chamberlain's reply, while admitting that he might have\r\noverstated his case, was a proclamation of loyalty to his\r\nCommander-in-Chief and an appeal for getting down to the business of\r\nwinning the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The Fourteen Points_\r\n\r\n    _President Wilson's program for the world's peace was outlined in\r\n    the Fourteen Points, which constituted part of an address delivered\r\n    before Congress January 8, 1918, as follows:_\r\n\r\n\r\n    _No Private Understandings_\r\n\r\n    1 OPEN COVENANTS of peace, openly arrived at, after which there\r\n    shall be no private international understandings of any kind, but\r\n    diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Freedom of the Seas_\r\n\r\n    2 ABSOLUTE FREEDOM of navigation upon the seas outside territorial\r\n    waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed\r\n    in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of\r\n    international covenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _No Economic Barriers_\r\n\r\n    3 THE REMOVAL, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the\r\n    establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the\r\n    nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its\r\n    maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Reduce National Armaments_\r\n\r\n    4 ADEQUATE GUARANTEES given and taken that national armaments will\r\n    be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Colonial Claims_\r\n\r\n    5 A FREE, open minded and absolutely impartial adjustment of all\r\n    colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle\r\n    that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests\r\n    of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the\r\n    equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Russian Territory_\r\n\r\n    6 THE EVACUATION of all Russian territory and such a settlement of\r\n    all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest\r\n    cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her\r\n    an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent\r\n    determination of her own political development and national policy\r\n    and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free\r\n    nations under institutions of her own choosing, and, more than a\r\n    welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may\r\n    herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations\r\n    in the months to come will be the acid test of their good-will, of\r\n    their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own\r\n    interests and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Restoration of Belgium_\r\n\r\n    7 BELGIUM, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and\r\n    restored without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she\r\n    enjoys in common with all other free nations. No other single act\r\n    will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the\r\n    nations in the laws which they have themselves set and determined\r\n    for the government of their relations with one another. Without\r\n    this healing act the whole structure and validity of international\r\n    law is forever impaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Alsace-Lorraine to France_\r\n\r\n    8 ALL FRENCH territory should be freed and the invaded portions\r\n    restored and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the\r\n    matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the\r\n    world for nearly fifty years, should be righted in order that peace\r\n    may once more be made secure in the interest of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _New Frontiers for Italy_\r\n\r\n    9 A READJUSTMENT of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along\r\n    clearly recognizable lines of nationality.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Autonomy in Austria-Hungary_\r\n\r\n    10 THE PEOPLES of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we\r\n    wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest\r\n    opportunity of autonomous development.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Rumania, Serbia and Montenegro_\r\n\r\n    11 RUMANIA, SERBIA and MONTENEGRO should be evacuated; occupied\r\n    territories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the\r\n    sea, and the relations of the several Balkan States to one another\r\n    determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines\r\n    of allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the\r\n    political and economic independence and territorial integrity of\r\n    the several Balkan States should be entered into.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Autonomy in Turkey_\r\n\r\n    12 THE TURKISH portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be\r\n    assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are\r\n    now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of\r\n    life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous\r\n    development, and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a\r\n    free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under\r\n    international guarantees.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _For an Independent Poland_\r\n\r\n    13 AN INDEPENDENT Polish State should be erected which should\r\n    include the territory inhabited by indisputably Polish populations,\r\n    which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea and\r\n    whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity\r\n    should be guaranteed by international covenant.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _League of Nation_\r\n\r\n    14 A GENERAL association of nations must be formed under specific\r\n    covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guaranties of\r\n    political independence and territorial integrity to great and small\r\n    States alike.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the war did not go on into 1919. If America could contribute no\r\naircraft and guns to the campaign of 1918, she could at least\r\ncontribute men. The emergency of March and April brought forth a\r\nprodigious effort, and soldiers began to be shipped across the Atlantic\r\nby hundreds of thousands. By July 4 there were a million, before the\r\nend of the year over 2,000,000; and they could fight. At the end of the\r\nSummer the Germans realized that the war was lost; and realizing it,\r\nthey turned back to President Wilson's mediation which they had\r\nrejected eighteen months before, and to the Fourteen Points which had\r\nbeen looked on so coldly in the previous Winter.\r\n\r\nThe first move was made by the Austrians, who on Sept. 15 proposed a\r\nconference for a \"preliminary and non-binding\" discussion of war aims.\r\nThe President refused the next day, with the observation that America's\r\nwar aims had been stated so often that there could be no doubt what\r\nthey were. But it was evident that more peace proposals would follow,\r\nand on Sept. 27 the President delivered an address in the Metropolitan\r\nOpera House in New York in which his latest conception of the duties of\r\nthe Peace Conference was set forth. He had realized that peace without\r\nvictory was unsafe in view of the character of the German Government;\r\nit must be a peace with guarantees, for nobody would trust the Germans.\r\nBut it must be a peace of impartial justice, \"involving no\r\ndiscrimination between those to whom we wish to be just and those to\r\nwhom we do not wish to be just,\" and the guarantee must be provided by\r\na League of Nations which the Peace Conference itself--and not a\r\nsubsequent general conference, as the President had held in the days of\r\nhis neutrality--must organize. The development was logical; nearly all\r\nthe American powers had entered the war, and neutrals were far less\r\nnumerous than in 1916. And he argued that the League of Nations must be\r\nformed at the Peace Conference, to be \"in a sense the most essential\r\npart\" of its work, because it was not likely that it could be formed\r\nafter the conference, and if formed during the war it would only be an\r\nalliance of the powers associated against Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Germans apparently thought these pronouncements offered some hope.\r\nTheir Government was hastily being covered with a false front of\r\ndemocratic institutions to suit his insistence, and on Oct. 4 the new\r\nChancellor, Prince Max of Baden, appealed to the President to call a\r\npeace conference at once, the basis of peace to be the Fourteen Points\r\nand conditions set forth in the President's later addresses,\r\nspecifically that of Sept. 27. There ensued an interchange of notes\r\nlasting throughout an entire month, in which the President acted\r\nnominally as intermediary between the Germans and the Allies, though\r\nactually he was in constant touch with allied statesmen. What began as\r\na duel of diplomatic dexterity presently developed into a German\r\ndiplomatic rout as the German armies, retreating everywhere, drew\r\nnearer and nearer German soil. Positions which the German Government\r\nhad hoped to defend were successively abandoned; the Germans agreed to\r\naccept without argument the Fourteen Points, with discussion at the\r\nconference limited only to details of their practical application, and\r\nto recognize the alterations which had been made in some of them by\r\nsubsequent decisions of the American Government. They accepted the\r\nPresident's insistence that a peace conference must be conditional on\r\nan armistice which would imply complete evacuation of allied territory\r\nand the assurance of \"the present supremacy\" of the allied armies, and\r\nthey strove desperately to convince him that the democratization of the\r\nGerman Government was real. Delegates went to Marshal Foch to discuss\r\nthe armistice terms, and on Nov. 5 the Allies formally notified the\r\nPresident that they accepted the Fourteen Points, with the reservation\r\nof the freedom of the seas and subject to a definition of the\r\nrestitution which the Germans must make for damage done.\r\n\r\nOn the same day sailors of the German High Sea Fleet, ordered out to\r\ndie fighting in a last thrust at the British, mutinied and began a\r\nrevolution that spread all over the empire. From the balcony of the\r\nImperial Palace in Berlin Karl Liebknecht proclaimed the republic; the\r\nKaiser fled across the Dutch border between two days; and on Nov. 11\r\nthe fighting ended and the Germans submitted to the terms imposed by\r\nMarshal Foch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peace Conference and Treaty, 1919_\r\n\r\nSo the war had been ended by the military defeat of the Germans. In\r\narranging the preliminaries of peace Mr. Wilson's influence had been\r\ndominant. But the personal aspect of his triumph was far more imposing\r\nin 1918 than it could possibly have been in 1916. Had his mediation\r\nended the war before America entered it would have been bitterly\r\nresented in the allied countries and by American sympathizers of the\r\nAllies. But in the interval the President had appeared as the leader of\r\nthe nation which furnished the decisive addition to allied strength\r\nthat brought the final victory; he had at last condemned in strong\r\nterms the German Government, toward which he had to maintain a neutral\r\nattitude earlier in the war, and he had had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthat Government overthrown at last when the German people realized that\r\nit had cost them more than it was worth. So now the war was ended in\r\nvictory, but still ended by Wilson's mediation, and moreover on terms\r\nwhich he himself had laid down--another triumph that would have been\r\nunthinkable two years earlier. In November, 1918, Woodrow Wilson was\r\nexalted in the estimation of the world more highly than any other human\r\nbeing for a century past, and far more highly than any other American\r\nhad ever been raised in the opinion of the peoples of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut he had just suffered a surprising defeat at home. It became evident\r\nto Democratic leaders in the early Fall of 1918 that they were likely\r\nto lose the Congressional elections. Democratic leadership in the House\r\nof Representatives had been so notoriously incompetent that most of the\r\nwar measures had had to be carried through under the leadership of\r\nRepublicans, and there was grave dissatisfaction with some of the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet. The appeals of Democrats in danger were heard\r\nsympathetically at the White House, and on Oct. 25 the President had\r\nissued a statement asking the people to vote for Democratic\r\nCongressional candidates \"if you have approved of my leadership and\r\nwish me to continue to be your unembarrassed spokesman in affairs at\r\nhome and abroad.\" He admitted that the Republicans in Congress had\r\nsupported the war, but declared that they had been against the\r\nAdministration and that the time was too critical for divided\r\nleadership. It was the sort of appeal that any European Premier might\r\nhave made upon \"going to the country,\" and the President ended with the\r\nstatement that \"I am your servant and will accept your judgment without\r\ncavil.\"\r\n\r\nIf this statement had never been issued, the results of the ensuing\r\nelection might not have been accepted as a repudiation of the\r\nPresident. But he had made it a \"question of confidence,\" to borrow a\r\nterm from European politics, and the result was disastrous. The\r\nelections gave the Republicans a majority of thirty-nine in the lower\r\nhouse and a majority of two in the Senate, which by a two-thirds vote\r\nwould have to ratify the peace treaty which the Executive would\r\nnegotiate. In such a situation a European Premier would, of course,\r\nhave had to resign, but the President of the United States could hardly\r\nresign just as the war was coming to an end. The attempt to fit the\r\nparliamentary system into the framework of the American Constitution\r\nhad failed. The President made no comment on the outcome of the\r\nelection, but he continued to be the unembarrassed spokesman of America\r\nin affairs at home and particularly abroad. It soon became known that\r\nhe intended to go to the Peace Conference in person--at the request, it\r\nwas intimated, of Clemenceau and Lloyd George. The criticism of this\r\nplan was by no means confined to Republicans, but the President\r\npersisted in it. There was a widespread demand for a non-partisan Peace\r\nCommission, but the apparent concession which the President finally\r\nmade to this sentiment--the appointment of Henry White, long out of the\r\ndiplomatic service and never very active in politics, as the sole\r\nRepresentative on a commission of five--satisfied the bulk of\r\nRepublican sentiment not at all. It should be observed however, that\r\nbehind the five official delegates there was a host of experts--military,\r\neconomic, legal and ethnological--some of whom did very important\r\nservice at the conference; and in the selection of this body no party\r\nlines had been drawn.\r\n\r\nOn December 4 the President sailed from New York on an army transport,\r\naccompanied by Mrs. Wilson and by a whole caravan of savants loaded\r\ndown with statistics and documents. He left a nation whose sentiment\r\nwas divided between sharp resentment and a rather apprehensive hope for\r\nthe best, but he landed on a continent which was prepared to offer to\r\nWoodrow Wilson a triumphal reception such as European history had never\r\nknown. The six weeks between his landing at Brest and the opening of\r\nthe Peace Conference were devoted to a series of processions through\r\nEngland, France and Italy, in which the Governments and the people\r\nstrove to outdo each other in expressing their enthusiasm for the\r\nleader of the great and victorious crusade for justice and democracy.\r\nSovereigns spiritual and temporal and the heads of Governments heaped\r\nhim with all the honors in their power, and crowds of workingmen stood\r\nfor hours in the rain that they might see him for a moment at a\r\nrailroad station. Even from neutral Holland, divided Ireland and\r\nhostile Germany came invitations to the President, and he would\r\nprobably have been received by those peoples as enthusiastically as by\r\nBritish, French and Italians.\r\n\r\nFor the war had been ended on the basis of the ideals of President\r\nWilson. Those ideals had been expressed in vague and general terms, and\r\nevery Government thought that its own war aims coincided with them.\r\nEvery people, suddenly released from the long and terrible strain of\r\nthe war, thought that all its troubles were suddenly to be ended by the\r\nprinciples of President Wilson. Jugo-Slavs and Italians claimed Istria\r\nand Fiume, and each felt itself supported by the principles of\r\nPresident Wilson. To Frenchmen those principles meant that Germany must\r\npay for the war forced on France, and to Germans they meant that a\r\nruined France and an uninvaded Germany could start again on the same\r\nfooting.\r\n\r\nThe Peace conference that began on January 18 was bound to disillusion\r\na great many people, including President Wilson himself. Principles had\r\nto be translated into practice, and every effort to do so left one\r\nparty to the dispute, if not both, convinced that the principles had\r\nbeen betrayed. The treaty which was eventually produced led American\r\nliberals to complain that the President had surrendered to European\r\nimperialism, and brought from such Republicans as still admired the\r\nAllies the complaint that he had betrayed allied interests at the\r\npromptings of pacifism. Equally diverse opinions might have been\r\nobtained from all types of extremists in Europe. The Fourteen Points\r\nwere susceptible of varying interpretations, according to individual\r\ninterests; and at the very outset the American delegates found some of\r\nthe allied leaders contending that they need not be considered, since\r\nthe Germans had surrendered, not because they regarded the principles\r\nof President Wilson as just, but because they had been beaten. There\r\nwas undoubtedly a great deal of truth in this contention, but the\r\nAmerican delegates succeeded in holding the conference to the position\r\nthat having accepted the German surrender on certain terms it would\r\nhave to abide by those terms. The terms had to be interpreted, however,\r\nand every agreement on the details led to a protest from somebody that\r\nthe President had abandoned the Fourteen Points.\r\n\r\nAll this, together with the growing Republican opposition at home which\r\nwas making itself heard in Europe, led to a rapid decline in the\r\nPresident's prestige. So long as it was a question of generalities he\r\nwas the moral leader of the peoples of the world, but after a few weeks\r\nof getting down to particulars he was only the head of the peace\r\ndelegation of a single State--and a State in which there was already\r\nserious opposition to his policy. This altered standing was made\r\nevident toward the end of April, when a protracted disagreement with\r\nthe Italian delegation over the Adriatic question led the President to\r\nissue a declaration of his position which was virtually an appeal to\r\nthe Italian people over the heads of their own representatives. Nowhere\r\nhad the President been received with more enthusiasm than in his trip\r\nthrough Italy four months before; but now Dr. Orlando, the Italian\r\nPremier, went home and promptly got a virtually unanimous vote of\r\nconfidence from his Parliament, which was supported by the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the people.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was finally signed on June 28, and the President left at\r\nonce for home to take up the fight to get it through the Senate--a\r\nfight which, it was already apparent, would be about as hard as the\r\nstruggle to get any treaty evolved at all out of the conflicting\r\nnational interests in Paris. There was a demonstration for him at Brest\r\nas he left French soil, but nothing like the enthusiasm that had\r\ngreeted his arrival. This was perhaps the measure of his inevitable\r\ndecline in the estimation of Europe; it remained to be seen how he\r\nstood at home. As early as January 1, before the Peace Conference met,\r\nSenator Lodge, Republican leader in the Senate, had declared that the\r\nconference ought to confine itself to the Peace Treaty and leave the\r\nLeague of Nations for later discussion.\r\n\r\nOn February 14, after the first reading of the League covenant, the\r\nPresident had made a hurried trip home to talk it over with the Senate\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations--a committee that had been loaded up\r\nwith enemies of the League of Nations. The members of the committee\r\ndined with him at the White House on February 26, and the covenant was\r\ndiscussed for several hours. But the President could not convert the\r\ndoubters; on March 3 Senator Lodge announced that thirty-seven\r\nRepublican Senators were opposed to the League in its present form, and\r\nthat they regarded a demand for its alteration as the exercise of the\r\nSenate's constitutional right of advice on treaties. The President took\r\nup the challenge, and on the following day, just before sailing back to\r\nParis, he declared in a public address that the League and treaty were\r\ninextricably interwoven; that he did not intend to bring back \"the\r\ncorpse of a treaty,\" and that those who opposed the League must be deaf\r\nto the demands of common men the world over.\r\n\r\nThe fight was now begun. Some modifications were made in the covenant\r\nin the direction of meeting criticisms by Elihu Root, but it was\r\nadopted. On July 10 the treaty was laid before the Senate and referred\r\nto the Committee on Foreign Relations, which at once began to hear\r\nopinions on it. The President himself appeared before the committee on\r\nAugust 19. Outside the Senate party lines were breaking up; the Irish\r\nand German elements who had come into line during the war, but had felt\r\nthat their interpretation of President Wilson's ideals had been\r\nviolated by the treaty, were aligned in support of the Republican\r\nopposition; and a certain element of the Democratic Party which\r\ninclined to admire the theory of traditional isolation found itself in\r\nharmony with the Republicans. On the other hand, many moderate\r\nRepublicans supported the President, chief among them Mr. Taft; and in\r\nthe churches and colleges support of the League commanded an\r\noverwhelming majority.\r\n\r\nConvinced that the people were behind him against the Senate, or would\r\nbe behind him if they understood the issue, the President left\r\nWashington on September 3 for another appeal to the country. Declaring\r\nthat if America rejected the League it would \"break the great heart of\r\nthe world,\" he went to the Pacific Coast on a long and arduous speaking\r\ntour, another request, in effect, for a vote of confidence for his work\r\nas Premier. The effort was too much; he broke down at Wichita, Kan., on\r\nSeptember 26, and was hurried back to the White House, where for weeks\r\nhe lay disabled by an illness whose nature and seriousness were\r\ncarefully concealed at the time, and even yet but imperfectly\r\nunderstood. Meanwhile the treaty had been reported out of committee,\r\nand the offering of a multitude of amendments, all of which were\r\ndefeated, led eventually to the drawing up of the \"Lodge reservations,\"\r\nfinally adopted on November 16.\r\n\r\nNobody knew how sick the President was, but Senator Hitchcock, who had\r\nled the fight for the treaty in the Senate, saw him on November 18 and\r\nwas told that in the President's opinion the Lodge reservations\r\namounted to nullification of the treaty. So the Democrats voted against\r\nthe treaty. Lodge's refusal to accept Wilson's treaty was as unshakable\r\nas Wilson's refusal to accept Lodge's treaty. When the special session\r\nended and the regular session began the President eventually yielded a\r\nlittle and consented to interpretative reservations proposed by Senator\r\nHitchcock. But this would not satisfy the Republicans; and on March 20\r\nthe rejected treaty was finally sent back to the White House.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Closing Year, 1920-1921_\r\n\r\nThe President's recovery was slow, and the first incidents of his\r\nreturn to the management of public affairs were rather startling, in\r\nview of the abrupt manner with which he resumed the direction of\r\nexecutive policy. During his illness the Cabinet had met from time to\r\ntime and in a fashion had carried on the routine work of the executive\r\ndepartment. Had it not done so, had the gravity of the President's\r\nillness been generally known, the demand which was heard for an\r\nexplanation of the constitutional reference to the \"disability of the\r\nPresident\" and an understanding of the circumstances under which the\r\nVice-President might assume the office would have been much stronger.\r\nThere was a good deal of apprehension, therefore, when Secretary of\r\nState Lansing resigned, and the published correspondence showed that\r\nthe President had regarded his action in calling Cabinet meetings as a\r\nusurpation of Presidential authority. It was evident from the\r\ncorrespondence that another and perhaps stronger reason for the\r\nPresident's disapproval had been the action of the Secretary in\r\nconducting a Mexican Policy on his own initiative, during the\r\nPresident's illness, which showed considerable divergence from the\r\nPresident's own. Nevertheless, the manner of the action caused some\r\nuneasiness and there was much surprise when Mr. Lansing was replaced by\r\nBainbridge Colby, a comparatively recent proselyte from the Progressive\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nThere was still further uncertainty as to the condition of the\r\nPresident when he re-entered with a series of rather sharp notes into\r\nthe Adriatic controversy, which England, France and Italy had been\r\ntrying to settle, without consulting the Jugoslavs, during his illness;\r\nand a letter to Senator Hitchcock on March 8, asserting that the\r\nmilitarist party was at that time in control of France, aroused grave\r\nmisgivings on both sides of the Atlantic. These, however, were\r\nunjustified; the President's improvement, though gradual, continued.\r\nBut the work of the Executive during 1920 was far less important than\r\nin previous years, for the interest of the country was concentrated on\r\nthe Presidential election.\r\n\r\nOn January 8 a letter from the President had been read at the Jackson\r\nDay dinner in Washington, in which he refused to accept the Senate's\r\ndecision on the treaty as the decision of the nation. \"If there is any\r\ndoubt as to what the people of the country think about the matter,\" he\r\nadded, \"the clear and single way out is ... to give the next election\r\nthe form of a great and solemn referendum.\" Once more, as in 1918, the\r\nPresident had asked for a verdict on his leadership. There was some\r\nperturbation among the Democratic leaders, for into a Presidential\r\nelection so many issues enter that it would be difficult to regard it\r\nas a referendum on any particular issue. It might have been so accepted\r\nif the President himself had come forward as a candidate for a third\r\nterm, but there was no sign from the White House as to his attitude on\r\nthis issue, and there was no spontaneous demand for him outside. The\r\nleading candidate during the pre-convention campaign was William G.\r\nMcAdoo, the President's son-in-law, who had resigned as Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury and Director General of Railroads after making a\r\nsuccessful record during the war, and before the criticism of the\r\nWilson Administration as a whole had become acute. McAdoo had the\r\npowerful support of organized labor and most of the Federal\r\noffice-holders, but whether or not he had the support of the White\r\nHouse no man knew. The Republicans assumed it for their own purposes,\r\nand Senator Lodge's keynote speech at the Chicago Convention was full\r\nof denunciations of the \"Wilson dynasty\"; but if McAdoo were Wilson's\r\ncandidate the President showed no sign of knowing it.\r\n\r\nThat McAdoo was not nominated, however, can be ascribed very largely to\r\nhis relationship to the President and the suspicion that he was the\r\nPresident's candidate. The Democratic Convention at San Francisco\r\nadopted a platform praising and indorsing the President's record in all\r\ndetails. The convention had to do that; the President's record was the\r\nparty's record. Homer Cummings as Temporary Chairman kept the\r\nconvention cheered up by a keynote speech of eulogy of that record,\r\nwhich moved the assembled Democrats to such enthusiasm that Secretary\r\nof State Colby, who had not been a Democrat long enough to know much\r\nabout the behavior of the species, declared that at any movement that\r\nday the rules could have been suspended and the President renominated\r\nby acclamation. But when the convention came down to the work of\r\nnomination the President was not considered, and the delegates devoted\r\nthemselves to finding the most available man who had not had any\r\nconnection with the Administration. James M. Cox was finally nominated\r\non Woodrow Wilson's record and sent out to the great and solemn\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\nAside from a formal proclamation of unity of ideals and intentions with\r\nthe candidate, the White House took practically no part in the\r\ncampaign. Not until October, when a delegation of pro-League\r\nRepublicans called at the White House, was it known that the\r\nPresident's health had temporarily taken a turn for the worse and that\r\nactive participation would have been impossible. It could hardly have\r\naffected the result very much in either direction.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the President had intended to turn over the Government\r\nto Hughes in November, 1916, he did nothing so unkind to Harding in\r\nNovember, 1920. The President-elect was allowed plenty of time to try\r\nto choose his Cabinet and his policies, but the Administration had\r\ngradually withdrawn from all connection with European affairs, and it\r\nwas made known soon after Congress met in December that nothing would\r\nbe done which might embarrass the new Administration in its handling of\r\nforeign relations and interrelated problems.\r\n\r\nThe history of Woodrow Wilson's Administration virtually ends with the\r\nrejection of the treaty; but the business of government had to be\r\ncarried on through the final year. During 1920 old issues that had long\r\nbeen hidden behind the war clouds came out into the open again. Obregon\r\noverthrew Carranza and entered into power in Mexico, but the Wilson\r\nAdministration maintained neutrality during the brief struggle.\r\nAmbassador Fletcher had resigned, but Henry Morgenthau, appointed to\r\nsucceed him, did not obtain the confirmation of the Senate, and the new\r\nAdministration had not been formally recognized at the end of President\r\nWilson's term. A controversy over the status of American oil rights was\r\none of the chief impediments to recognition, though Obregon's general\r\nattitude was far more friendly to America than that of Carranza.\r\n\r\nThe President in November announced the boundaries of Armenia, which he\r\nhad drawn at the request of the European Allies. But these boundaries\r\nwere of no particular interest by that time, since the Turks and the\r\nBolsheviki were already partitioning Armenia; and the mediation between\r\nthe Turks and Armenians which the Allies requested the President to\r\nundertake was forestalled by the Bolshevist conquest of the remnant of\r\nthe country. The Adriatic dispute, in which the President had taken\r\nsuch a prominent part in 1919, was finally settled without him by\r\ndirect negotiation between Italy and Jugoslavia. In one other\r\ninternational problem, however, that of Russia, the United States\r\nGovernment still exerted some influence. The President during 1918 had\r\nshowed more willingness to believe in the possibility of some good\r\ncoming out of Bolshevist Russia than most of the European Governments,\r\nand the American Expeditionary Forces in Siberia took no active part in\r\nthe fighting there. At the Peace Conference the President had been\r\nwilling to call the various Russian parties to the Prinkipo conference,\r\nbut nothing came of this; and America eventually took up a middle\r\nground toward Russia. While the British seemed ready to make friends\r\nwith the Bolsheviki and the French remained irreconcilably hostile, the\r\nAmerican Government--whose policy was fully set forth in a note of\r\nAugust 10, 1920--refused to attack them, but also to have any dealings\r\nwith them. This policy was much criticised as being purely negative,\r\nbut toward the end of Mr. Wilson's Administration both England and\r\nFrance were tending to follow it through the force of circumstances,\r\nEngland's effort to find a basis of trade relations with Bolshevist\r\nRussian being as futile as France's support of anti-Bolshevist\r\nrevolutionary movements.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans and their Irish supporters in the 1920 campaign revived\r\nthe old demand for the exemption of American shipping from the Panama\r\nCanal tolls, but this and various other differences with England which\r\narose toward the end of Mr. Wilson's Administration were left over for\r\nsettlement by the new President. More urgent, however, was another\r\nancient issue now revived--the California land question. In 1917, when\r\nAmerica was just entering the war and could not afford any dangerous\r\nentanglements on the Pacific, the Lansing-Ishii agreement was\r\nnegotiated with Japan. By this the United States recognized Japan's\r\n\"special interests\" in China, particularly in \"the parts to which her\r\nterritory is contiguous,\" while both powers professed agreement on the\r\nprinciples of Chinese independence and territorial integrity, and the\r\nopen door. However necessary this concession in order to protect an\r\nexposed flank in time of war, it was regarded with much alarm by\r\nfriends of China, whose wrath was later aroused by the action of the\r\nPresident at the Peace Conference in agreeing to the cession of\r\nShantung to Japan. There was a renewed antagonism between American and\r\nJapanese interests in certain quarters, and the American Army in\r\nSiberia, if it did nothing else, at least kept the Japanese from\r\nseizing Vladivostok until the Americans had left.\r\n\r\nWith this background, the situation created by the revival of\r\nanti-Japanese agitation in California seemed more or less disquieting,\r\nbut when a more stringent land law was enacted by the Californians in\r\nNovember negotiations between the two Governments began at once and are\r\nstill going on at the close of the Administration with good prospect of\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nThe President's unpopularity had been so violently expressed by the\r\nelection of November 2 that it was bound to be mitigated soon after,\r\nand this natural reaction was aided by the failure of the Republican\r\nCongress to accomplish anything in the short session and by\r\nPresident-elect Harding's slowness in deciding among candidates offered\r\nfor the Cabinet and policies put forward for his attention. As\r\nPresident Wilson prepared to turn over the executive duties to his\r\nsuccessor there was already evidence that the American public was\r\nreturning to a greater appreciation of his services. As a token of the\r\nestimation in which he was still held by the more intelligent circles\r\nabroad, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to him in December, 1920; and\r\nEuropean statesmen who had opposed him at the Peace Conference were\r\nalready expressing surprise at learning that Mr. Harding believed that\r\nthe League of Nations was dead.\r\n\r\n_Copyright_ New York _Times_.\r\n\r\n_Published through the courtesy of the New York Times._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    In Flanders Fields\r\n\r\n    By Lieut.

Smuts was an active leader of the Boer Army in the field in\r\n    the Boer war. He is a graduate of Cambridge University in England,\r\n    served as state attorney for the South African Republic, and was\r\n    known as a member of the bar at Cape Town.\r\n\r\n    Accepting the outcome of the Boer war, he entered the service of\r\n    the British Government, becoming colonial secretary for the\r\n    Transvaal in 1907 and exercising a leading influence as a delegate\r\n    in the national convention in 1910, which drew up the constitution\r\n    for the present Union of South Africa. He was minister of the\r\n    defense of the South African Government and commanded the troops in\r\n    the campaign against the Germans in East Africa in 1916-17.\r\n    Promoted to be an honorary lieutenant-general, he was the South\r\n    African representative in the imperial war cabinet in 1917-18. This\r\n    led to his prominence in the peace conference and to his close\r\n    contact with President Wilson. On February 8, of this year, Premier\r\n    Smuts and the South African party won a decisive victory at the\r\n    polls over Gen. Hertzog and those who advocated the secession of\r\n    South Africa from the British Empire.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE NEW YORK EVENING POST AND THE WASHINGTON HERALD\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pretoria, South Africa, January 8, 1921._\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that I should write a short estimate and\r\nappraisal of the work of President Wilson on the termination of his\r\nPresidency of the United States of America. I feel I must comply with\r\nthe suggestion. I feel I may not remain silent when there is an\r\nopportunity to say a word of appreciation for the work of one with whom\r\nI came into close contact at a great period and who rendered the most\r\nsignal service to the great human cause.\r\n\r\nThere is a great saying of Mommsen (I believe) in reference to the\r\nclose of Hannibal's career in failure and eclipse: \"On those whom the\r\ngods love they lavish infinite joys and infinite sorrows.\" It has come\r\nback to my mind in reference to the close of Wilson's career. For a few\r\nbrief moments he was not only the leader of the greatest State in the\r\nworld; he was raised to far giddier heights and became the center of\r\nthe world's hopes. And then he fell, misunderstood and rejected by his\r\nown people, and his great career closes apparently in signal and tragic\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Position of Terrible Greatness_\r\n\r\nWhat is the explanation for this tremendous tragedy, which is not\r\nsolely American, which closely concerns the whole world? Of course,\r\nthere are purely American elements in the explanation which I am not\r\ncompetent to speak on. But besides the American quarrel with President\r\nWilson there is something to be said on the great matters in issue. On\r\nthese I may be permitted to say a few words.\r\n\r\nThe position occupied by President Wilson in the world's imagination at\r\nthe close of the great war and at the beginning of the peace conference\r\nwas terrible in its greatness. It was a terrible position for any mere\r\nman to occupy. Probably to no human being in all history did the hopes,\r\nthe prayers, the aspirations of many millions of his fellows turn with\r\nsuch poignant intensity as to him at the close of the war. At a time of\r\nthe deepest darkness and despair, he had raised aloft a light to which\r\nall eyes had turned. He had spoken divine words of healing and\r\nconsolation to a broken humanity. His lofty moral idealism seemed for a\r\nmoment to dominate the brutal passions which had torn the Old World\r\nasunder. And he was supposed to possess the secret which would remake\r\nthe world on fairer lines. The peace which Wilson was bringing to the\r\nworld was expected to be God's peace. Prussianism lay crushed; brute\r\nforce had failed utterly. The moral character of the universe had been\r\nsignally vindicated. There was a universal vague hope in a great moral\r\npeace, of a new world order arising visibly and immediately on the\r\nruins of the old. This hope was not a mere superficial sentiment. It\r\nwas the intense expression at the end of the war of the inner moral and\r\nspiritual force which had upborne the peoples during the dark night of\r\nthe war and had nerved them in an effort almost beyond human strength.\r\nSurely, God had been with them in that long night of agony. His was the\r\nvictory; His should be the peace. And President Wilson was looked upon\r\nas the man to make this great peace. He had voiced the great ideals of\r\nthe new order; his great utterances had become the contractual basis\r\nfor the armistice and the peace. The idealism of Wilson would surely\r\nbecome the reality of the new order of things in the peace treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saved the \"Little Child\"_\r\n\r\nIn this atmosphere of extravagant, almost frenzied expectation he\r\narrived at the Paris Peace Conference. Without hesitation he plunged\r\ninto that inferno of human passions. He went down into the Pit like a\r\nsecond Heracles to bring back the fair Alcestis of the world's desire.\r\nThere were six months of agonized waiting, during which the world\r\nsituation rapidly deteriorated. And then he emerged with the peace\r\ntreaty. It was not a Wilson peace, and he made a fatal mistake in\r\nsomehow giving the impression that the peace was in accord with his\r\nFourteen Points and his various declarations. Not so the world had\r\nunderstood him. This was a punic peace, the same sort of peace as the\r\nvictor had dictated to the vanquished for thousands of years. It was\r\nnot Alcestis; it was a haggard, unlovely woman with features distorted\r\nwith hatred, greed and selfishness, and the little child that the woman\r\ncarried was scarcely noticed. Yet it was for the saving of the child\r\nthat Wilson had labored until he was a physical wreck. Let our other\r\ngreat statesmen and leaders enjoy their well-earned honors for their\r\nunquestioned success at Paris. To Woodrow Wilson, the apparent failure,\r\nbelongs the undying honor, which will grow with the growing centuries,\r\nof having saved the \"little child that shall lead them yet.\" No other\r\nstatesman but Wilson could have done it. And he did it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_People Did Not Understand_\r\n\r\nThe people, the common people of all lands, did not understand the\r\nsignificance of what had happened. They saw only that hard, unlovely\r\nPrussian peace, and the great hope died in their hearts. The great\r\ndisillusionment took its place. The most receptive mood for a new start\r\nthe world had been in for centuries passed away. Faith in their\r\ngovernors and leaders was largely destroyed and the foundations of the\r\nhuman government were shaken in a way which will be felt for\r\ngenerations. The Paris peace lost an opportunity as unique as the great\r\nwar itself. In destroying the moral idealism born of the sacrifices of\r\nthe war it did almost as much as the war itself in shattering the\r\nstructure of Western civilization.\r\n\r\nAnd the odium for all this fell especially on President Wilson. Round\r\nhim the hopes had centered; round him the disillusion and despair now\r\ngathered. Popular opinion largely held him responsible for the bitter\r\ndisappointment and grievous failure. The cynics scoffed; his friends\r\nwere silenced in the universal disappointment. Little or nothing had\r\nbeen expected from the other leaders; the whole failure was put to the\r\naccount of Woodrow Wilson. And finally America for reasons of her own\r\njoined the pack and at the end it was his own people who tore him to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Must Wait for Judgment_\r\n\r\nWill this judgment, born of momentary disillusion and disappointment,\r\nstand in future, or will it be reversed? The time has not come to pass\r\nfinal judgment on either Wilson or any of the other great actors in the\r\ndrama at Paris. The personal estimates will depend largely on the\r\ninterpretation of that drama in the course of time. As one who saw and\r\nwatched things from the inside, I feel convinced that the present\r\npopular estimates are largely superficial and will not stand the\r\nsearching test of time. And I have no doubt whatever that Wilson has\r\nbeen harshly, unfairly, unjustly dealt with, and that he has been made\r\na scapegoat for the sins of others. Wilson made mistakes, and there\r\nwere occasions when I ventured to sound a warning note. But it was not\r\nhis mistakes that caused the failure for which he has been held mainly\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nLet us admit the truth, however bitter it is to do so, for those who\r\nbelieve in human nature. It was not Wilson who failed. The position is\r\nfar more serious. It was the human spirit itself that failed at Paris.\r\nIt is no use passing judgments and making scapegoats of this or that\r\nindividual statesman or group of statesmen. Idealists make a great\r\nmistake in not facing the real facts sincerely and resolutely. They\r\nbelieve in the power of the spirit, in the goodness which is at the\r\nheart of things, in the triumph which is in store for the great moral\r\nideals of the race. But this faith only too often leads to an optimism\r\nwhich is sadly and fatally at variance with actual results.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Says Humanity Failed_\r\n\r\nIt is the realist and not the idealist who is generally justified by\r\nevents. We forget that the human spirit, the spirit of goodness and\r\ntruth in the world, is still only an infant crying in the night, and\r\nthat the struggle with darkness is as yet mostly an unequal struggle.\r\n\r\nParis proved this terrible truth once more. It was not Wilson who\r\nfailed there, but humanity itself. It was not the statesmen that failed\r\nso much as the spirit of the peoples behind them. The hope, the\r\naspiration for a new world order of peace and right and\r\njustice--however deeply and universally felt--was still only feeble and\r\nineffective in comparison with the dominant national passions which\r\nfound their expression in the peace treaty. Even if Wilson had been one\r\nof the great demi-gods of the human race, he could not have saved the\r\npeace. Knowing the Peace Conference as I knew it from within, I feel\r\nconvinced in my own mind that not the greatest man born of woman in the\r\nhistory of the race would have saved that situation. The great hope was\r\nnot the heralding of the coming dawn, as the peoples thought, but only\r\na dim intimation of some far-off event toward which we shall yet have\r\nto make many a long, weary march. Sincerely as we believed in the moral\r\nideals for which he had fought, the temptation at Paris of a large\r\nbooty to be divided proved too great. And in the end not only the\r\nleaders but the peoples preferred a bit of booty here, a strategic\r\nfrontier there, a coal field or an oil well, an addition to their\r\npopulation or their resources--to all the faint allurements of the\r\nideal. As I said at the time, the real peace was still to come, and it\r\ncould only come from a new spirit in the peoples themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wilson Had to Be Conciliated_\r\n\r\nWhat was really saved at Paris was the child--the covenant of the\r\nLeague of Nations. The political realists who had their eye on the loot\r\nwere prepared--however reluctantly--to throw up that innocent little\r\nsop to President Wilson and his fellow idealists. After all, there was\r\nnot much harm in it, it threatened no present national interest, and it\r\ngave great pleasure to a number of good unpractical people in most\r\ncountries. Above all, President Wilson had to be conciliated, and this\r\nwas the last and the greatest of the fourteen points on which he had\r\nset his heart and by which he was determined to stand or fall. And so\r\nhe got his way. But it is a fact that only a man of his great power and\r\ninfluence and dogged determination could have carried the covenant\r\nthrough that Peace Conference. Others had seen with him the great\r\nvision; others had perhaps given more thought to the elaboration of the\r\ngreat plan. But his was the power and the will that carried it through.\r\nThe covenant is Wilson's souvenir to the future of the world. No one\r\nwill ever deny that honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great Creative Document_\r\n\r\nThe honor is very great, indeed, for the covenant is one of the great\r\ncreative documents of human history. The peace treaty will fade into\r\nmerciful oblivion and its provisions will be gradually obliterated by\r\nthe great human tides sweeping over the world. But the covenant will\r\nstand as sure as fate. Forty-two nations gathered round it at the first\r\nmeeting of the League at Geneva. And the day is not far off when all\r\nthe free peoples of the world will gather around it. It must succeed,\r\nbecause there is no other way for the future of civilization. It does\r\nnot realize the great hopes born of the war, but it provides the only\r\nmethod and instrument by which in the course of time those hopes can be\r\nrealized. Speaking as one who has some right to speak on the\r\nfundamental conceptions, objects and methods of the covenant, I feel\r\nsure that most of the present criticism is based on misunderstandings.\r\nThese misunderstandings will clear away, one by one the peoples still\r\noutside the covenant will fall in behind this banner, under which the\r\nhuman race is going to march forward to triumphs of peaceful\r\norganization and achievements undreamt of by us children of an\r\nunhappier era. And the leader who, in spite of apparent failure,\r\nsucceeded in inscribing his name on that banner has achieved the most\r\nenviable and enduring immortality. Americans of the future will yet\r\nproudly and gratefully rank him with Washington and Lincoln, and his\r\nname will have a more universal significance than theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NOBLE PEACE PRIZE 1920\r\n               WITHOUT THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE.\r\n               KIRBY IN THE NEW YORK _World_\r\n\r\n    \"We die without distinction if we are not willing to die the death\r\n    of sacrifice.

No other American has ever bulked so large in the affairs of\r\ncivilization or wielded so commanding an influence in shaping their\r\nends.\r\n\r\nThe great outstanding figure of the war, Mr. Wilson remains the great\r\noutstanding figure of the peace. Broken in health and shattered in\r\nbody, Mr. Wilson is leaving the White House, but his spirit still\r\ndominates the scene. It pervades every chancellery in Europe. It hovers\r\nover every capital. Because Woodrow Wilson was President of the United\r\nStates during the most critical period of modern history international\r\nrelations have undergone their first far-reaching moral revolution.\r\n\r\nMr. Harding is assuming the duties of the Presidency, but the main\r\ninterest in Mr. Harding is still a reflected interest, which is\r\nconcerned chiefly with the efforts that his Administration may make to\r\nadjust itself to the forces that Mr. Wilson has set in motion. Stripped\r\nof all the paraphernalia of his office, Mr. Wilson, by virtue of his\r\nachievements, remains the most potent single influence in the modern\r\nworld; yet after this eight years in the White House it may be doubted\r\nif even the American people themselves know him better or understand\r\nhim better than they did the day he was first inaugurated.\r\n\r\nNeither Mr. Wilson's friends nor his enemies have ever succeeded in\r\ninterpreting him or in explaining him, nor can any interpretation or\r\nexplanation be satisfactory which fails at the outset to recognize in\r\nhim the simplest and at the same time the most complex character in the\r\ngreatest drama ever played on the stage of human history. Even his\r\nclosest associates have never found it easy to reconcile a fervent\r\npolitical democracy with an unbending intellectual aristocracy, or to\r\ndetermine which of those characteristics was dominant in his day-to-day\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\nNo man ever sat in the President's chair who was more genuinely a\r\ndemocrat or held more tenaciously to his faith in democracy than\r\nWoodrow Wilson, but no other man ever sat in the President's chair who\r\nwas so contemptuous of all intellect that was inferior to his own or so\r\nimpatient with its laggard processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A President Who Dealt in Ideas_\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson was a President who dealt almost exclusively in ideas. He\r\ncared little or nothing about political organization and rarely\r\nconsulted the managing politicians of his party. When they conferred\r\nwith him it was usually at their request and not at his request.\r\nPatronage hardly entered into his calculations as an agency of\r\ngovernment. He disliked to be troubled about appointments, and when he\r\nhad filled an office he was likely to be indifferent as to the manner\r\nin which that office was subsequently administered, unless his own\r\nmeasures were antagonized or his policies obstructed.\r\n\r\nNo man was ever more impersonal in his attitude toward government, and\r\nthat very impersonality was the characteristic which most baffled the\r\nAmerican people. Mr. Wilson had a genius for the advocacy of great\r\nprinciples, but he had no talent whatever for advocating himself, and\r\nto a country that is accustomed to think in headlines about political\r\nquestions his subtlety of mind and his careful, precise style of\r\nexpression were quite as likely to be an obstacle to the communication\r\nof thought as a medium for the communication of thought. That is how\r\nsuch phrases as \"too proud to fight\" and \"peace without victory\" were\r\nsuccessfully wrested from their context by his critics and twisted into\r\na fantastic distortion of their true meaning.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson was likewise totally deficient in the art of advertising,\r\nand advertising is the very breath of American politics. He held\r\nhimself aloof from all these points of public contact. _The World's_\r\nrelations with him have certainly been as close and intimate as those\r\nof any other newspaper; yet during the eight years in which Mr. Wilson\r\nhas been in the White House he never sought a favor from _The World_,\r\nhe never asked for support either for himself or any of his policies,\r\nhe never complained when he was criticised, he never offered to explain\r\nhimself or his attitude on any issue of government. In the troublesome\r\ndays of his Administration he often expressed his gratitude for\r\nservices that _The World_ had rendered in the interpretation of his\r\npolicies, but he never solicited such interpretation or took measures\r\nto facilitate it. He was an eloquent pleader for the principles in\r\nwhich he believed, but he had no faculty whatever for projecting\r\nhimself into the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Experience of History_\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson's enemies are fond of calling him a theorist, but there is\r\nlittle of the theorist about him, otherwise he could never have made\r\nmore constructive history than any other man of his generation. What\r\nare commonly called theories in his case were the practical application\r\nof the experience of history to the immediate problems of government,\r\nand in the experience of history Mr. Wilson is an expert. With the\r\nexception of James Madison, who was called \"the Father of the\r\nConstitution,\" Mr. Wilson is the most profound student of government\r\namong all the Presidents, and he had what Madison conspicuously lacked,\r\nwhich was the faculty to translate his knowledge of government into the\r\nadministration of government.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wilson was elected President he had reached the conclusion\r\nwhich most unprejudiced students of American government eventually\r\narrive at--that the system of checks and balances is unworkable in\r\npractice and that the legislative and executive branches cannot be in\r\nfact coördinate, independent departments. Other Presidents have acted\r\non that hypothesis without daring to admit it, and endeavored to\r\ncontrol Congress by patronage and by threats. Mr. Wilson without any\r\nformality established himself as the leader of his party in Congress,\r\nPremier as well as President, and the originator of the party's program\r\nof legislation.\r\n\r\nSenators and Representatives denounced him as an autocrat and a\r\ndictator. Congress was described as the President's rubber stamp, but\r\nMr. Wilson established something that more nearly resembled responsible\r\ngovernment than anything that had gone before, and Congress under his\r\ndirect leadership made a record for constructive legislation for which\r\nthere is no parallel. It was due to this kind of leadership that such\r\nmeasures as the Federal Reserve Banking Law were enacted, which later\r\nproved to be the one bulwark between the American people and a\r\nfinancial panic of tragic proportions.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Wilson's domestic policies in spite of their magnitude have\r\nbeen obscured by his foreign policies. Had there been no war, these\r\npolicies in themselves would have given to the Wilson Administration a\r\nplace in American history higher than that of any other since the Civil\r\nWar. What some of his predecessors talked about doing he did, and he\r\naccomplished it by the process of making himself the responsible leader\r\nof his party in Congress--a process that is simple enough but capable\r\nof fulfillment only in the hands of a man with an extraordinary\r\ncapacity for imposing his will on his associates. Mr. Wilson's control\r\nover Congress for six years was once described as the most impressive\r\ntriumph of mind over matter known to American politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Wilson's Foreign Policies_\r\n\r\nWhen we begin the consideration of Mr. Wilson's foreign policies we are\r\nentering one of the most remarkable chapters in all history, and one\r\nwhich will require the perspective of history for a true judgment.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the development of these foreign policies came in Mr.\r\nWilson's refusal to recognize Huerta, who had participated in the plot\r\nto murder President Madero and made himself the dictator of Mexico by\r\nreason of this assassination. The crime was committed during Mr. Taft's\r\nAdministration. When Mr. Wilson came into office he served notice that\r\nthere would be no recognition of Huerta and no recognition of any\r\nMexican Government which was not established by due process of law.\r\n\r\nWhat was plainly in Mr. Wilson's mind was a determination to end\r\npolitical assassination in Latin America as a profitable industry, and\r\ncompel recognition, to some extent at least, of democratic principles\r\nand constitutional forms. On this issue he had to face the intense\r\nopposition of all the financial interests in the United States which\r\nhad Mexican holdings, and a consolidated European opposition as well.\r\nEvery dollar of foreign money invested in Mexico was confident that\r\nwhat Mexico needed most was such a dictatorship as that of Huerta or\r\nAmerican intervention. Mr. Wilson's problem was to get rid of Huerta\r\nwithout involving the United States in war, and then by steady pressure\r\nbring about the establishment of a responsible government that rested\r\non something at least resembling the consent of the governed. Only a\r\nstatesman of high ideals would ever have attempted it, and only a\r\nstatesman of almost infinite patience would have been able to adhere to\r\nthe task that Mr. Wilson set for himself.\r\n\r\nMexico is not yet a closed incident, but Mr. Wilson's policy has been\r\nvindicated in principle. For the first time since Mr. Roosevelt shocked\r\nthe moral sense and aroused the political resentment of all the\r\nLatin-American states by the rape of Panama, faith in the integrity and\r\nfriendship of the United States has been restored among the other\r\nnations of the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nOf equal or even greater ethical importance was Mr. Wilson's insistence\r\non the repeal of the Panama Canal Tolls Act, which discriminated in\r\nfavor of American ships in spite of the plain provisions of the\r\nHay-Pauncefote treaty. This was the more creditable on Mr. Wilson's\r\npart because he himself had been tricked during the campaign into\r\ngiving his support to this measure. When he began to perceive the\r\ndiplomatic consequences of this treaty violation Mr. Wilson reversed\r\nhimself and demanded that Congress reverse itself. Had he done\r\notherwise, the American people would have had scant opportunity to\r\nprotest against the German perfidy which turned a treaty into \"a scrap\r\nof paper.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Germany, at the beginning of August, 1914, declared war\r\nsuccessively on Russia, France and Belgium, thereby bringing Great\r\nBritain into the most stupendous conflict of all the centuries, Mr.\r\nWilson did what every President has done when other nations have gone\r\nto war. He issued a proclamation of neutrality. He then went further,\r\nhowever, than any of his predecessors had done and urged the American\r\npeople to be not only neutral in deed but \"impartial in thought.\" Mr.\r\nWilson has been severely criticised for this appeal. The more violent\r\npro-Germans and the more violent pro-French and pro-British regarded it\r\nas a personal insult and an attempt on the part of the President to\r\nstifle what they were pleased to regard as their conscience.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson asked the American people to be impartial in thought because\r\nhe knew as a historian the danger that threatened if the country were\r\nto be divided into two hostile camps, the one blindly and unreasoningly\r\napplauding every act of the Germans and the other blindly and\r\nunreasoningly applauding every act of the Allies. In the early years of\r\nhis life the Republic was all but wrecked by the emotional and\r\npolitical excesses of the pro-French Americans and the pro-British\r\nAmericans in the war that followed the French Revolution. The warning\r\nagainst a passionate attachment to the interests of other nations which\r\nis embodied in Washington's Farewell Address was the first President's\r\nsolemn admonition against the evils of a divided allegiance. Mr. Wilson\r\nhad no desire to see the country drift into a similar situation in\r\nwhich American rights, American interests and American prestige would\r\nall be sacrificed to gratify the American adherents of the various\r\nEuropean belligerents. Moreover, he understood far better than his\r\ncritics that issues would soon arise between the belligerents and the\r\nUnited States which would require on the part of the American people\r\nthat impartiality of thought that is demanded of the just and upright\r\njudge. He knew that the American people might ultimately become the\r\nfinal arbiters of the issues of the conflict.\r\n\r\nThe United States was the only great nation outside the sphere of\r\nconflict. It was the only great nation that had no secret diplomatic\r\nunderstandings with either set of belligerents. It was the only great\r\nnation that was in a position to uphold the processes of international\r\nlaw and to use its good offices as a mediator when the opportunity\r\narose.\r\n\r\nFor two years Mr. Wilson genuinely believed that it would be possible\r\nfor the United States to fulfill this mission, and he never fully lost\r\nhope until that day in January, 1917, when the German Government\r\nwantonly wrecked all the informal peace negotiations that were then in\r\nprogress and decided to stake the fate of the empire on a single throw\r\nof the U-boat dice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A United Country First_\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson perceived quite as quickly and quite as early as anybody the\r\npossibility that the United States would be drawn into the war, but he\r\nperceived also what most of his critics failed to perceive, that the\r\nimmediate danger of the country was not war but a divided people. While\r\nhe was engaging in framing the first Lusitania note he discussed the\r\nsituation with one of his callers at the White House in words that have\r\nsince proved prophetic:\r\n\r\n    I do not know whether the German Government intends to keep faith\r\n    with the United States or not. It is my personal opinion that\r\n    Germany has no such intention, but I am less concerned about the\r\n    ultimate intentions of Germany than about the attitude of the\r\n    American people, who are already divided into three groups: those\r\n    who are strongly pro-German, those who are strongly pro-Ally, and\r\n    the vast majority who expect me to find a way to keep the United\r\n    States out of war. I do not want war, yet I do not know that I can\r\n    keep the country out of the war. That depends on Germany, and I\r\n    have no control over Germany. _But I intend to handle this\r\n    situation in such a manner that every American citizen will know\r\n    that the United States Government has done everything it could to\r\n    prevent war. Then if war comes we shall have a united country, and\r\n    with a united country there need be no fear about the result._\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson's policy from that day to April 2, 1917, must be read in the\r\nlight of those words. He plunged forthwith into that extraordinary\r\ndebate with the German Government over the submarine issue--the most\r\nmomentous debate ever held--but he was only incidentally addressing\r\nhimself to the rulers of Germany. He was talking to the conscience of\r\nthe civilized world, but primarily to the conscience of the United\r\nStates, explaining, clarifying, elucidating the issue. His reluctance\r\nto countenance any extensive measures of preparedness was the product\r\nof a definite resolution not to give Germany and her American\r\nsupporters an opportunity to declare that the United States, while\r\nthese issues were pending, was arming for war against the Imperial\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wilson began this debate he knew something which his critics\r\ndid not know and which for reasons of state he did not choose to tell\r\nthem. Weeks before the destruction of the Lusitania two-thirds of the\r\nGerman General Staff were in favor of war with the United States as a\r\nmilitary measure in the interest of Germany. They were under the spell\r\nof Tirpitz. They believed that the submarine could do all that the\r\nGrand Admiral said it could do. They argued that inasmuch as the Allies\r\nwere borrowing money in the United States, obtaining food from the\r\nUnited States and purchasing great quantities of munitions in the\r\nUnited States Germany, by restricting submarine warfare in answer to\r\nAmerican protests, was paying an excessive price for what was in effect\r\na fictitious neutrality. In their opinion the United States as a\r\nneutral was already doing more for the Allies than it could do as an\r\nactive belligerent if free scope were given to the U-boats. The\r\nAmerican Navy, they said, could be safely disregarded, because with\r\nGermany already blockaded by the British Navy, and the German Grand\r\nFleet penned in, the addition of the American Navy, or a dozen navies\r\nfor that matter, would make little difference in respect to the actual\r\nfacts of sea power. On the other hand there was not enough shipping\r\navailable to feed the Allies and enable the United States to send an\r\narmy to Europe. If the United States tried to provide troops, the\r\nBritish would starve. If the United States could not send troops,\r\nGermany would be just as well off with the United States in the war as\r\nout of the war, and would have the priceless additional advantage of\r\nbeing able to employ her submarines as she saw fit, regardless of the\r\ntechnicalities of international law.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1916 Mr. Wilson decided definitely that the relations\r\nbetween the United States and Germany were approaching a climax. If the\r\nwar continued much longer the United States would inevitably be drawn\r\nin. There was no prospect of a decision. The belligerent armies were\r\ndeadlocked. Unwilling to wait longer for events, Mr. Wilson made up his\r\nmind that he would demand from each side a statement of its aims and\r\nobjects and compel each side to plead its own cause before the court of\r\nthe public opinion of the world. This was done on December 18, 1916, in\r\na joint note which was so cold and dispassionate in its terms that its\r\nimport was hardly understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_With Clean Hands_\r\n\r\nThe President said that the aims and objects of the war on both sides\r\n\"as stated in general terms to their own people and the world\" seemed\r\nto be \"virtually the same,\" and he asked for a bill of particulars.\r\nInstantly there was wild turmoil and recrimination on the part of the\r\nAllies and their friends in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe President had declared, they said, that the Germans and the Allies\r\nwere fighting for the same thing. Mr. Wilson had expressed no opinion\r\nof his own one way or the other and the obvious discovery was soon made\r\nin London and Paris that the President had given to the Allies the\r\nopportunity which they needed of officially differentiating their war\r\naims from those of the Germans. The German Government missed its\r\nopportunity completely, and by their own answer to the President's note\r\nthe Allies succeeded in consolidating their moral positions, which was\r\nsomething they had never previously been able to do in spite of all\r\ntheir propaganda.\r\n\r\nInformal peace negotiations were still in progress, although conducted\r\nin secret and carefully screened from the knowledge of all peoples\r\ninvolved in the conflict. On January 22, 1917, Mr. Wilson made his last\r\nattempt at mediation in the \"peace without victory\" address to the\r\nSenate in which he defined what he regarded as the fundamental\r\nconditions of a permanent peace. Most of the basic principles of this\r\naddress were afterward incorporated into the Fourteen Points. Here\r\nagain Mr. Wilson was the victim of his own precision of language and of\r\nthe settled policy of his critics of reading into his public utterances\r\nalmost everything except what he actually said. He himself has insisted\r\non giving his own interpretation of \"peace without victory,\" and this\r\ninterpretation was instantly rejected by the super-patriots who\r\nregarded themselves as the sole custodians of all the issues of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _Underwood & Underwood_\r\n               1919: On the bridge of the _George Washington_ on\r\n               the return from the Peace Conference]\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The President and the Treaty_\r\n\r\n    _President Wilson sails for Europe, December 4, 1918._\r\n\r\n    _Visits to England, France and Italy, December-January, 1918-19._\r\n\r\n    _Peace Conference opened, January 18, 1919._\r\n\r\n    _League Covenant adopted, February 14, 1919._\r\n\r\n    _President Wilson's trip home, February 24-March 5, 1919._\r\n\r\n    _The treaty signed, June 28, 1919._\r\n\r\n    _Submission to the Senate, July 10, 1919._\r\n\r\n    _The President's speaking tour, September 3-26, 1919._\r\n\r\n    _Adoption of the Lodge reservations, November 16, 1919._\r\n\r\n    _Final defeat of the treaty in the Senate, March 20, 1920._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _Edmonston_\r\n               February 15, 1921: Mr. Wilson's latest photograph--made\r\n               at a meeting of the Cabinet]\r\n\r\n\r\n    TWO PICTURES\r\n\r\n    By Joseph P. Tumulty\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Two pictures are in my mind. First, the Hall of Representatives\r\n    crowded from floor to gallery with expectant throngs. Presently it\r\n    is announced that the President of the United States will address\r\n    Congress. There steps out to the Speaker's desk a straight,\r\n    vigorous, slender man, active and alert. He is sixty years of age,\r\n    but he looks not more than forty-five, so lithe of limb, so alert\r\n    of bearing, so virile. It is Woodrow Wilson reading his great war\r\n    message. The other picture is only three and a half years later.\r\n    There is a parade of Veterans of the Great War. They are to be\r\n    reviewed by the President on the east terrace of the White House.\r\n    In a chair sits a man, your President, broken in health, but still\r\n    alert in mind. His hair is white, his shoulders bowed, his figure\r\n    bent. He is sixty-three years old, but he looks older. It is\r\n    Woodrow Wilson. Presently, in the procession there appears an\r\n    ambulance laden with wounded soldiers, the maimed, the halt and the\r\n    blind. As they pass they salute, slowly reverently. The President's\r\n    right hand goes up in answering salute. I glanced at him. There\r\n    were tears in his eyes. The wounded is greeting the wounded; those\r\n    in the ambulance, he in the chair, are alike, casualties of the\r\n    Great War._\r\n\r\n    _From address by Joseph P. Tumulty_\r\n    _Thursday, Oct. 28, 1920_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the armistice was signed one of the most eminent of living British\r\nstatesmen gave it as his opinion that the war had lasted two years too\r\nlong, and that the task of salvaging an enduring peace from the wreck\r\nhad become well-nigh insuperable. It will always be one of the\r\nfascinating riddles of history to guess what the result would have been\r\nif Mr. Wilson's final proposals for mediation had been accepted. The\r\nUnited States would not have entered the war, and a less violent\r\nreadjustment of the internal affairs of Europe would probably have\r\nresulted. There would have been no Bolshevist revolution in Russia and\r\nno economic collapse of Europe. Nor is it certain that most of the\r\nreally enduring benefits of the Treaty of Versailles could not have\r\nbeen as well obtained by negotiation as they were finally obtained\r\nthrough a military victory which cost a price that still staggers\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the German Government, now fighting to maintain the\r\ndynasty and the Junker domination, took the issue out of Mr. Wilson's\r\nhands. Ten days after his \"peace without victory\" address the German\r\nautocracy put into effect its cherished programme of ruthless submarine\r\nwarfare. The only possible answer on the part of the United States was\r\nthe dismissal of Count von Bernstorff the German Ambassador, and from\r\nthat time war between the United States and Germany was only a matter\r\nof days. But Mr. Wilson had achieved the great purpose that he had\r\nformulated two years before. He had been balked in his efforts at\r\nmediation, but he had united the American people on the issues of the\r\nconflict. He had demonstrated to them that their Government had exerted\r\nevery honorable means to avoid war and that its hands were clean. There\r\nwas no uncertainty in their own minds that the responsibility for the\r\nwar rested solely on Germany, and Mr. Wilson now purposed to write the\r\nterms of peace with the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Call to a Crusade_\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson's War Address on the night of April 2, 1917, was the most\r\ndramatic event that the National Capitol had ever known. In the\r\npresence of both branches of Congress, of the Supreme Court, of the\r\nCabinet and of the Diplomatic Corps, Mr. Wilson summoned the American\r\npeople not to a war but to a crusade in words that instantaneously\r\ncaptivated the imagination of the Nation:\r\n\r\n    But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for\r\n    the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts--for\r\n    democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a\r\n    voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of\r\n    small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert\r\n    of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and\r\n    make the world at last free. To such a task we can dedicate our\r\n    lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that\r\n    we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come\r\n    when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the\r\n    principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which\r\n    she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.\r\n\r\nThis was not Woodrow Wilson, the intellectual aristocrat, who was\r\nspeaking, but Woodrow Wilson, the fervent democrat, proclaiming a new\r\ndeclaration of independence to the embattled peoples.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Congress declared war than Mr. Wilson proceeded to\r\nmobilize all the resources of the Nation and throw them into the\r\nconflict. This war was different from any other war in which the United\r\nStates had ever engaged, not only by reason of its magnitude but by\r\nreason of the necessity for coördinating American military plans with\r\nthe military plans of the Allies. The Allies were not quite agreed as\r\nto what they desired of the United States, aside from unlimited\r\nfinancial assistance, and the solution of the general problem depended\r\nmore or less on the trend of events.\r\n\r\nThe test of any war policy is its success, and it is a waste of time to\r\nenter into a vindication of the manner in which the Wilson\r\nAdministration made war, or to trouble about the accusations of waste\r\nand extravagance, as if war were an economic process which could be\r\ncarried on prudently and frugally. The historian is not likely to\r\ndevote serious attention to the partisan accusations relating to Mr.\r\nWilson's conduct of the war, but he will find it interesting to record\r\nthe manner in which the President brought his historical knowledge to\r\nbear in shaping the war policies of the country.\r\n\r\nThe voluntary system and the draft system had both been discredited in\r\nthe Civil War, so Mr. Wilson demanded a Selective-Service Act under\r\nwhich the country could raise 10,000,000 troops, if 10,000,000 troops\r\nwere needed, without deranging its essential industries. It had taken\r\nMr. Lincoln three years to find a General whom he could intrust with\r\nthe command of the Union armies. Mr. Wilson picked his Commander in\r\nChief before he went to war and then gave to Gen. Pershing the same\r\nkind of ungrudging support that Mr. Lincoln gave to Gen. Grant. The\r\nCivil War had been financed by greenbacks and bond issues peddled by\r\nbankers. Mr. Wilson called on the American people to finance their own\r\nwar, and they unhesitatingly responded. In the war with Spain the\r\ncommissary system had broken down completely owing to the antiquated\r\nmethods that were employed. No other army in time of war was ever so\r\nwell fed or so well cared for as that of the United States in the\r\nconflict with Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wilson as a War President_\r\n\r\nMistakes there were in plenty, both in methods and in the choice of\r\nmen, and errors of judgment and the shortcomings that always result\r\nfrom a lack of experience, but the impartial verdict of history must be\r\nthat when everything is set forth on the debit side of the balance\r\nsheet which can be set forth Mr. Wilson remains the most vigorous of\r\nall the war Presidents. Yet it is also true that history will concern\r\nitself far less with Mr. Wilson as a war President than with Mr. Wilson\r\nas a peace-making President. It is around him as a peace-making\r\nPresident that all the passions and prejudices and disappointments of\r\nthe world still rage.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson in his \"peace without victory\" address to the Senate\r\nprevious to the entrance of the United States into the war had sketched\r\na general plan of a coöperative peace. \"I am proposing, as it were,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that the nations with one accord should adopt the doctrine of\r\nPresident Monroe as the doctrine of the world.\" He returned to the\r\nsubject again in his War Address, in which he defined the principles\r\nfor which the United States was to fight and the principles on which an\r\nenduring peace could be made. The time came when it was necessary to be\r\nstill more specific.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1918 the morale of the Allies was at its lowest ebb.\r\nRussia had passed into the hands of the Bolsheviki and was preparing to\r\nmake a separate peace with Germany. There was widespread discontent in\r\nItaly, and everywhere in Europe soldiers and civilians were asking one\r\nanother what they were really fighting for. On January 8 Mr. Wilson\r\nwent before Congress and delivered the address which contained the\r\nFourteen Points of peace, a message which was greeted both in the\r\nUnited States and in Europe as a veritable Magna Charta of the nations.\r\nMr. Wilson had again become the spokesman of the aspirations of\r\nmankind, and from the moment that this address was delivered the\r\nthrones of the Hohenzollerns and the Hapsburgs ceased to be stable.\r\n\r\nTen months later they were to crumble and collapse. Before the\r\narmistice was signed on Nov. 11, 1918, Mr. Wilson had overthrown the\r\ndoctrine of Divine right in Europe. The Hapsburgs ran away. The Kaiser\r\nwas compelled to abdicate and take refuge in exile, justifying his\r\nflight by the explanation that Wilson would not make peace with Germany\r\nwhile a Hohenzollern was on the throne. This was the climax of Mr.\r\nWilson's power and influence and, strangely enough, it was the dawn of\r\nhis own day of disaster.\r\n\r\nFor nearly six years Mr. Wilson had manipulated the Government of the\r\nUnited States with a skill that was almost uncanny. He had turned\r\nhimself from a minority President into a majority President. He had so\r\ndeftly outmanoeuvred all his opponents in Congress and out of Congress\r\nthat they had nothing with which to console themselves except their\r\nintensive hatred of the man and all that pertained to him. Then at the\r\nvery summit of his career he made his first fatal blunder.\r\n\r\nEvery President in the off-year election urges the election of a\r\nCongress of his own party. That is part of the routine of politics, and\r\nduring the campaign of 1918 Mr. Wilson's advisers urged him to follow\r\nthe precedent. What they forgot and he forgot was that it was no time\r\nfor partisan precedents, and he allowed his distrust of the Republican\r\nleaders in Congress to sweep him into an inexcusable error that he, of\r\nall men, should have avoided. The Sixty-fifth Congress was anything but\r\npopular. The Western farmers were aggrieved because the price of wheat\r\nhad been regulated and the price of cotton had not. The East was\r\ngreatly dissatisfied with the war taxes, which it regarded as an unfair\r\ndiscrimination, and it remembered Mr. Kitchin's boast that the North\r\nwanted the war and the North would have to pay for it. There was\r\ngeneral complaint from business interests against the Southern\r\nDemocratic control of the legislative department, and all this\r\nsentiment instantly crystallized when the President asked for another\r\nDemocratic Congress. Republicans who were loyally supporting the\r\nAdministration in all its war activities were justly incensed that a\r\nparty issue had been raised. A Republican Congress was elected and by\r\ninference the President sustained a personal defeat.\r\n\r\nMisfortunes did not come singly in Mr. Wilson's case. Following the\r\nmistake of appealing for the election of a Democratic Congress he made\r\nan equally serious mistake in the selection of his Peace Commission.\r\n\r\nTo anybody who knows Mr. Wilson, who knows Mr. Lloyd George, who knows\r\nMr. Clemenceau, nothing could be sillier than the chapters of Keynes\r\nand Dillon in which they undertake to picture the President's unfitness\r\nto cope with the European masters of diplomacy. Mr. Wilson for years\r\nhad been playing with European masters of diplomacy as a cat plays with\r\na mouse. To assume that Mr. Wilson was ever deceived by the transparent\r\ntactics of Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Clemenceau is to assume the\r\nimpossible. It would be as easy to conceive of his being tricked and\r\nbamboozled by the United States Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Peace Commission_\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson needed strong Republican representation on the Peace\r\nCommission not to reinforce him in his struggles with his adversaries\r\nat Paris but to divide with him the responsibility for a treaty of\r\npeace that was doomed in advance to be a disappointment. Although the\r\npopular sentiment of Europe was almost passionate in its advocacy of\r\nPresident Wilson's peace program, all the special interests that were\r\nseeking to capitalize the peace for their own advantage or profit were\r\nactively at work and were beginning to swing all the influence that\r\nthey could command on their various Governments. It was inevitable from\r\nthe outset that Mr. Wilson could never get the peace that he had\r\nexpected. The treaty was bound to be a series of compromises that would\r\nsatisfy nobody, and when Mr. Wilson assumed all the responsibility for\r\nit in advance he assumed a responsibility that no stateman who had ever\r\nlived could carry alone. Had he taken Mr. Root or Mr. Taft or both of\r\nthem with him the terms of the Treaty of Versailles might have been no\r\ndifferent, but the Senate would have been robbed of the partisan\r\ngrievance on which it organized the defeat of ratification.\r\n\r\nDay after day during the conference Mr. Wilson fought the fight for a\r\npeace that represented the liberal thought of the world. Day after day\r\nthe odds against him lengthened. The contest finally resolved itself\r\ninto a question of whether he should take what he could get or whether\r\nhe should withdraw from the conference and throw the doors open to\r\nchaos. The President made the only decision that he had a moral right\r\nto make. He took what he could get, nor are the statesmen with whom he\r\nwas associated altogether to blame because he did not get more. They\r\ntoo had to contend against forces over which they had no control. They\r\nwere not free agents either, and Mr. Smuts has summed up the case in\r\ntwo sentences:\r\n\r\n    It was not the statesmen that failed so much as the spirit of the\r\n    peoples behind them. The hope, the aspiration, for a new world\r\n    order of peace and right and justice, however deeply and\r\n    universally felt, was still only feeble and ineffective in\r\n    comparison with the dominant national passions which found their\r\n    expression in the peace treaty.\r\n\r\nAll the passions and hatreds bred of four years of merciless warfare,\r\nall the insatiable fury for revenge, all the racial ambitions that had\r\nbeen twisted and perverted by centuries of devious diplomacy--these\r\nwere all gathered around the council table, clamorous in their demand\r\nto dictate the terms.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson surrendered more than he dreamed he was surrendering, but it\r\nis not difficult to follow his line of reasoning. The League of Nations\r\nwas to be a continuing court of equity, sitting in judgment on the\r\npeace itself, revising its terms when revision became necessary and\r\npossible, slowly readjusting the provisions of the treaty to a calmer\r\nand saner state of public mind. Get peace first. Establish the League,\r\nand the League would rectify the inevitable mistakes of the treaty.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious commentary on human nature that when the treaty was\r\ncompleted and the storm of wrath broke, all the rage, all the\r\nresentment, all the odium should have fallen on the one man who had\r\nstruggled week in and week out against the forces of reaction and\r\nrevenge and had written into the treaty all that it contains which\r\nmakes for the international advancement of the race.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Why The Treaty Was Beaten_\r\n\r\nInto that record must also go the impressive fact that the Treaty of\r\nVersailles was rejected by the United States Senate, under the\r\nleadership of Henry Cabot Lodge, not because of its acknowledged\r\ndefects and shortcomings, not because it breathed the spirit of a\r\nCarthaginian peace in its punitive clauses, but because of its most\r\nenlightened provision, the covenant of the League of Nations, which is\r\nthe one hope of a war-racked world.\r\n\r\nWhen people speak of the tragedy of Mr. Wilson's career they have in\r\nmind only the temporary aspects of it--the universal dissatisfaction\r\nwith the treaty of peace, his physical collapse, his defeat in the\r\nSenate and the verdict at the polls in November. They forget that the\r\nend of the chapter is not yet written. The League of Nations is a fact,\r\nwhatever the attitude of the United States may be toward it, and it\r\nwill live unless the peoples of the earth prove their political\r\nincapacity to use it for the promotion of their own welfare. The\r\nprinciple of self-determination will remain as long as men believe in\r\nthe right of self-government and are willing to die for it. It was\r\nWoodrow Wilson who wrote that principle into the law of nations, even\r\nthough he failed to obtain a universal application of it. Tacitus said\r\nof the Catti tribesmen, \"Others go to battle; these go to war,\" and Mr.\r\nWilson went to war in behalf of the democratic theory of government\r\nextended to all the affairs of the nations. That war is not yet won,\r\nand the Commander in Chief is crippled by the wounds that he received\r\non the field of action. But the responsibility for the future does not\r\nrest with him. It rests with the self-governing peoples for whom he has\r\nblazed the trail. All the complicated issues of this titanic struggle\r\nfinally reduce themselves to these prophetic words of Maximilian\r\nHarden: \"Only one conqueror's work will endure--Wilson's thought.\"\r\n\r\nWoodrow Wilson on this morning of the fourth of March can say, in the\r\nwords of Paul the Apostle to Timothy:\r\n\r\n    \"_For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is\r\n    at hand._\r\n\r\n    \"_I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have\r\n    kept the faith._\"\r\n\r\n    Copyright 1921, New York _World_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Covenant of the League of Nations_\r\n\r\nADOPTED BY THE PLENARY SESSION OF THE PEACE CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 28, 1919_\r\n\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nIn order to promote international cooperation and to achieve\r\ninternational peace and security, by the acceptance of obligations not\r\nto resort to war, by the prescription of open, just and honorable\r\nrelations between nations, by the firm establishment of the\r\nunderstandings of international law as to actual rule of conduct among\r\ngovernments, and by the maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect\r\nfor all treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with\r\none another, the high contracting parties agree to this Covenant of the\r\nLeague of Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle One\r\n\r\n[Membership]\r\n\r\nThe original members of the League of Nations shall be those of the\r\nsignatories which are named in the annex to this Covenant and also such\r\nof those other states named in the annex as shall accede without\r\nreservation to this Covenant.

In case\r\nany such emergency should arise, the Secretary-General shall, on the\r\nrequest of any member of the League, forthwith summon a meeting of the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nIt is also declared to be the fundamental right of each member of the\r\nLeague to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council any\r\ncircumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens\r\nto disturb either the peace or the good understanding between nations\r\nupon which peace depends.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Twelve\r\n\r\n[Postponement of War]\r\n\r\nThe members of the League agree that if there should arise between them\r\nany dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter\r\neither to arbitration or to inquiry by the Council, and they agree in\r\nno case to resort to war until three months after the award by the\r\narbitrators or the report by the Council.\r\n\r\nIn any case, under this Article the award of the arbitrators shall be\r\nmade within a reasonable time, and the report of the Council shall be\r\nmade within six months after the submission of the dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Thirteen\r\n\r\n[Arbitration of Justiciable Matters]\r\n\r\nThe members of the League agree that when ever any dispute shall arise\r\nbetween them which they recognize to be suitable for submission to\r\narbitration and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy,\r\nthey will submit the whole subject matter to arbitration.

For the consideration of any such dispute the court of\r\narbitration to which the case is referred shall be the court agreed on\r\nby the parties to the dispute or stipulated in any convention existing\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThe members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good\r\nfaith any award that may be rendered and that they will not resort to\r\nwar against a member of the League which complies therewith.

Any party to the dispute may effect such submission by giving\r\nnotice of the existence of the dispute to the Secretary-General, who\r\nwill make all necessary arrangements for a full investigation and\r\nconsideration thereof. For this purpose the parties to the dispute will\r\ncommunicate to the Secretary-General, as promptly as possible,\r\nstatements of their case, all the relevant facts and papers; the\r\nCouncil may forthwith direct the publication thereof.\r\n\r\nThe Council shall endeavor to effect a settlement of any dispute, and\r\nif such efforts are successful, a statement shall be made public giving\r\nsuch facts and explanations regarding the dispute and terms of\r\nsettlement thereof as the Council may deem appropriate.\r\n\r\nIf the dispute is not thus settled, the Council either unanimously or\r\nby a majority vote shall make and publish a report containing a\r\nstatement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are\r\ndeemed just and proper in regard thereto.\r\n\r\nAny member of the League represented on the Council may make public a\r\nstatement of the facts of the dispute and of the conclusions regarding\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nIf a report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members\r\nthereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to\r\nthe dispute, the members of the League agree that they will not go to\r\nwar with any party to the dispute which complies with the\r\nrecommendations of the report.\r\n\r\nIf the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to\r\nby the members thereof, other than the representatives of one or more\r\nof the parties to the dispute, the members of the League reserve to\r\nthemselves the right to take such action as they shall consider\r\nnecessary for the maintenance of right and justice.\r\n\r\nIf the dispute between the parties is claimed by one of them, and is\r\nfound by the Council to arise out of a matter which by international\r\nlaw is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the\r\nCouncil shall so report, and shall make no recommendation as to its\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe Council may in any case under this Article refer the dispute to the\r\nAssembly. The dispute shall be so referred at the request of either\r\nparty to the dispute, provided that such request be made within\r\nfourteen days after the submission of the dispute to the Council.\r\n\r\nIn any case referred to the Assembly all the provisions of this Article\r\nand of Article Twelve relating to the action and powers of the Council\r\nshall apply to the action and powers of the Assembly, provided that a\r\nreport made by the Assembly, if concurred in by the representatives of\r\nthose members of the League represented on the Council and of a\r\nmajority of the other members of the League, exclusive in each case of\r\nthe representatives of the parties to the dispute, shall have the same\r\nforce as a report by the Council concurred in by all the members\r\nthereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to\r\nthe dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Sixteen\r\n\r\n[Sanctions]\r\n\r\nShould any member of the League resort to war in disregard of its\r\ncovenants under Articles Twelve, Thirteen or Fifteen, it shall ipso\r\nfacto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other\r\nmembers of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it\r\nto the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition\r\nof all intercourse between their nations and the nationals of the\r\ncovenant-breaking state and the prevention of all financial,\r\ncommercial, or personal intercourse between the nationals of the\r\ncovenant-breaking state and the nationals of any other state, whether a\r\nmember of the League or not.\r\n\r\nIt shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the\r\nseveral governments concerned what effective military or naval forces\r\nthe members of the League shall severally contribute to the armaments\r\nof forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.\r\n\r\nThe members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually\r\nsupport one another in the financial and economic measures which are\r\ntaken under this Article, in order to minimize the loss and\r\ninconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will\r\nmutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at\r\none of their number by the covenant-breaking state, and that they will\r\ntake the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to\r\nthe forces of any of the members of the League which are cooperating to\r\nprotect the covenants of the League.\r\n\r\nAny member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League\r\nmay be declared to be no longer a member of the League by a vote of the\r\nCouncil concurred in by the representatives of all the other members of\r\nthe League represented thereon.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Seventeen\r\n\r\n[Disputes of Non-Members]\r\n\r\nIn the event of a dispute between a member of the League and a state\r\nwhich is not a member of the League, or between states not members of\r\nthe League, the state or states not members of the League shall be\r\ninvited to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the\r\npurposes of such dispute, upon such conditions as the Council may deem\r\njust. If such invitation is accepted, the provisions of Articles Twelve\r\nto Sixteen inclusive shall be applied with such modifications as may be\r\ndeemed necessary by the Council.\r\n\r\nUpon such invitation being given, the Council shall immediately\r\ninstitute an inquiry into the circumstances of the dispute and\r\nrecommend such action as may seem best and most effectual in the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIf a state so invited shall refuse to accept the obligations of\r\nmembership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, and shall\r\nresort to war against a member of the League, the provisions of Article\r\nSixteen shall be applicable as against the state taking such action.\r\n\r\nIf both parties to the dispute, when so invited, refuse to accept the\r\nobligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such\r\ndispute, the Council may take such measures and make such\r\nrecommendations as will prevent hostilities and will result in the\r\nsettlement of the dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Eighteen\r\n\r\n[Registration of International Engagements]\r\n\r\nEvery convention or international engagement entered into henceforward\r\nby any member of the League shall be forthwith registered with the\r\nSecretariat and shall as soon as possible be published by it. No such\r\ntreaty or international engagement shall be binding until so\r\nregistered.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Nineteen\r\n\r\n[Revision of Former Treaties]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by\r\nmembers of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable, and\r\nthe consideration of international conditions of which the continuance\r\nmight endanger the peace of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Twenty\r\n\r\n[Abrogation of Understandings not Consistent with the Covenant]\r\n\r\nThe members of the League severally agree that this Covenant is\r\naccepted as abrogating all obligations or understandings inter se which\r\nare inconsistent with the terms thereof, and solemnly undertake that\r\nthey will not hereafter enter into any engagements inconsistent with\r\nthe terms thereof.\r\n\r\nIn case members of the League shall, before becoming a member of the\r\nLeague, have undertaken any obligation inconsistent with the terms of\r\nthis covenant, it shall be the duty of such member to take immediate\r\nsteps to procure its release from such obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Twenty-One\r\n\r\n[The Monroe Doctrine]\r\n\r\nNothing in this covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity of\r\ninternational engagements such as treaties of arbitration or regional\r\nunderstandings like the Monroe Doctrine for securing the maintenance of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Twenty-Two\r\n\r\n[Mandatory Tutelage of Colonies and Backward Races]\r\n\r\nTo those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the late\r\nwar have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the states which\r\nformerly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able\r\nto stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern\r\nworld, there should be applied the principle that the well being and\r\ndevelopment of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilization and\r\nthat securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in\r\nthis covenant.\r\n\r\nThe best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that\r\nthe tutelage of such peoples be entrusted to advanced nations who, by\r\nreasons of their resources, their experience or their geographical\r\nposition, can best undertake this responsibility, and who are willing\r\nto accept it, and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as\r\nmandatories on behalf of the League.\r\n\r\nThe character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of the\r\ndevelopment of the people, the geographical situation of the territory,\r\nits economic condition and other similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nCertain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have\r\nreached a stage of development where their existence as independent\r\nnations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of\r\nadministrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as\r\nthey are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a\r\nprincipal consideration in the selection of the mandatory.\r\n\r\nOther peoples, especially those of Central Africa, are at such a stage\r\nthat the mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the\r\nterritory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience\r\nor religion subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals,\r\nthe prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic and\r\nthe liquor traffic and the prevention of the establishment of\r\nfortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of\r\nthe natives for other than police purposes and the defense of territory\r\nand will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of\r\nother members of the League.\r\n\r\nThere are territories, such as Southwest Africa and certain of the\r\nSouth Pacific islands, which, owing to the sparseness of their\r\npopulation or their small size or their remoteness from the centers of\r\ncivilization or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the\r\nmandatory and other circumstances, can be best administered under the\r\nlaws of the mandatory as integral portions of its territory subject to\r\nthe safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous\r\npopulation. In every case of mandate, the mandatory shall render to the\r\nCouncil an annual report in reference to the territory committed to its\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nThe degree of authority, control or administration to be exercised by\r\nthe mandatory shall, if not previously agreed upon by the members of\r\nthe League, be explicitly defined in each case by the Council.\r\n\r\nA permanent commission shall be constituted to receive and examine the\r\nannual reports of the mandatories and to advise the Council on all\r\nmatters relating to the observance of the mandates.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Twenty-Three\r\n\r\n[Humanitarian Provisions; Freedom of Transit]\r\n\r\nSubject to and in accordance with the provisions of international\r\nconventions existing or hereafter to be agreed upon, the members of the\r\nLeague (a) will endeavor to secure and maintain fair and humane\r\nconditions of labor for men, women and children both in their own\r\ncountries and in all countries to which their commercial and industrial\r\nrelations extend, and for that purpose will establish and maintain the\r\nnecessary international organizations; (b) undertake to secure just\r\ntreatment of the native inhabitants of territories under their control;\r\n(c) will entrust the League with the general supervision over the\r\nexecution of agreements with regard to the traffic in women and\r\nchildren, and the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs; (d) will\r\nentrust the League with the general supervision of the trade in arms\r\nand ammunition with the countries in which the control to this traffic\r\nis necessary in the common interest; (e) will make provision to secure\r\nand maintain freedom of communication and of transit and equitable\r\ntreatment for the commerce of all members of the League. In this\r\nconnection the special necessities of the regions devastated during the\r\nwar of 1914-1918 shall be in mind; (f) will endeavor to take steps in\r\nmatters of international concern for the prevention and control of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Twenty-Four\r\n\r\n[Control of International Bureaus and Commissions]\r\n\r\nThere shall be placed under the direction of the League all\r\ninternational bureaus already established by general treaties if the\r\nparties to such treaties consent. All such international bureaus and\r\nall commissions for the regulation of matters of international interest\r\nhereafter constituted shall be placed under the direction of the\r\nLeague.\r\n\r\nIn all matters of international interest which are regulated by general\r\nconventions but which are not placed under the control of international\r\nbureaus or commissions, the Secretariat of the League shall, subject to\r\nthe consent of the Council and if desired by the parties, collect and\r\ndistribute all relevant information and shall render any other\r\nassistance which may be necessary or desirable.\r\n\r\nThe Council may include as part of the expenses of the Secretariat the\r\nexpenses of any bureau or commission which is placed under the\r\ndirection of the League.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Twenty-Five\r\n\r\n[The Red Cross and International Sanitation]\r\n\r\nThe members of the League agree to encourage and promote the\r\nestablishment and coöperation of duly authorized voluntary national Red\r\nCross organizations having as purposes improvement of health, the\r\nprevention of disease and the mitigation of suffering throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Twenty-Six\r\n\r\n[Amendments of the Covenant; Right of Dissent]\r\n\r\nAmendments to this Covenant will take effect when ratified by the\r\nmembers of the League whose representatives compose the Council and by\r\na majority of the members of the League whose representatives compose\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\nNo such amendment shall bind any member of the League which signifies\r\nits dissent therefrom, but in that case it shall cease to be a member\r\nof the League.",
